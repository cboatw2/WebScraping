and if a blow seems to be necessary, let it
be done with a whip, more in terror than
eff-ct, an-1 after the voice has failed to procure
obedience. This may bo practiced
two or three times weekly. When the colt

creasing in proportion ?o tunc and strength

good and handsome horse whose stable was

as to make mc think that he might havt
swallowed some feathers of the hens that
perched in llw hay loft. Not suspecting any
other cause, I was at a loss to find it ou\
when one day going into the stable, I was
s ruck with a bid snr ell of the hog's pen,
arid conjecturing that to be the cause, I removed
the hog pen, and saw with great
pleasure that my horse recovered from a
cough that threatened bis lfe.
When a horse is sick in winter, he must
be covered. Every humane and reflecting
person must rejoice at leaving off the fashion
of Cutting off the horses tail. It is ci^nr that
nature fvroducos nothing in vain. The tail
may be tririvned ; but never forget that a
horse, harrassed by flies, has no other means
than bis tail, to bru^h them off aud that it
may prevent accidents, in keeping him to
stand qu?et.

FEEDING AND FATTENING FOWLS.
Fowls will become fat on the common ;
* run of the farm yard, where they thrive
-jpon the offals of the stable, and other refuse,
with perhaps somo small regular daiI
y foods; but at threshing time they become
particularly fat, and are thence styled barn >
*
door fowls, probably the most del cafe nnd
highly flavored of all others, both from
their full allowance of the first grain, and
the constant health in which they are kept
bv living in a natural state, and having the
full enjoyment of air and exercise. It is a
common practice with some housewives to
coop their barn door fowls for a weok or
two, under the notioD of improving them
for the table, and increasing their fat ; a
practico which, however, seldom succeeds,
since the fowls generally pine for the loss
of their liberty, and slighting their food, lose
instead of earning, additional fl ^sh. Such
a period, in fact, is too short for them to
become accustomed to confinement.

TO CORRECT DAMAGED GRAIN.
Musty grain, totally unfit for use, and
which can scarcely be ground, may, it is
said, be rendered perfectly sweet and sound
by inimorsmg it m boiling water, and letting
it remain until the water becomes cold.?The
quantity of water must be double to
that of the grain to be purified. The mu=tv
quality rarely penetrates through the husk
or bran of the wheaf. In the hot water, all
the decayed or ro:ten grains swim upon the
suiface, so lhat tlie remaining wheat is erfectualiy
cleansed from .-ill impurities, without
any material loss. It is afterwards to
be dried, stirring occasionally on the kiln.

SCCCESSPUL MODES OF REARING THE MORUS
MULTICAUL1S CAUSE OI THE GREAT FAILURES
IN 1839.
The time which I consider as most suitable
for planting the cuttings of the Morus
MuUicuuiis is the time which is usually
deemed best for sowing the seeds of the
Mulberry, and also of most small seeds ol
gar ten vegetables, and of Indian corn; that
time is in Massachusetts and near Boston,
about the 1st of May, or a little later, according
to the season, and after the earth j
has become in a measure warmed by the ]
sun, and the danger of sudden changes i
from heat to cold is past. If planted earlier
they are liable to vegetate prematurely,
and to be suddenly arrested in the bud, and
to perish during long cold Storms.
The chief cause of the very extraordinary
failure in cuttings during the present year in
the States of the E >s; and throughout Long
Islaud, in Pennsylvania, and Virginia, and
many other places, was caused by too early
planting, followed as it was by long cold
storms of extraordinary duration. And this
is not ti? only year in which great failures
have originated from this same cause. It
w&9 the same lost year at Long Island, as
it had been also in some former yeara both
at Long Island and in other places where
great failures bad arisen fsom too early
planting.
Many failures, without doubt, occured in
other places, and from far diflerenfjcauses.
This was perticularly the case with many
who bought French imported trees, as a
verj considerable portion of those trees had
lost their vitality on the passage. In many
cases the trees which were sold had l>een 1
ruined by oft changing hands, and removals
hither and thither, and long continued ex.,
posure during winter or spring. Tn other
cas"s, from imperfect and bad packing and
drying, or the alternate freezing and thaw- i
of their roots, and by careless management. 1
I am aware that several estimable men,
writers and cultivators of considerable ex.. |
periencc, in Noith Carolina and Virginia 1
judging from their own successful cuitiva- i
lion in former years, have highly and most 1
impressively recommended parly planting n? I
indispensable to tho most perfect suc-ess, i
and for the climate of Virginia even Feb., i
ruary was deemed by them as preferable I
si .u: u: ,
10 mnrcn. i rieir writings uu mis su -jeui
being circulated from publication,to publication,
throughout tbo country, seem to have
had a powerful offect, and to have induced
generally to very early planting. The usual
time for planting Indian corn at Portsmouth,
ir-ar Norfolk, in Virginia, us I was there*
informed, is generally about the 10.h of
April. At that place, nnd in the spring of
the present ^ear, I planted largely of th?*
Morus Multicaulis. A part I planted with
euttings, all of which I cut wiih hut a single
eye, and a part with roots. All cut.ings
which I planted very early succeeded ladly;
but all those cuttings which I planted very
late, succeeded admirably, as d:d all the
J0< t?. whether planted early or late.
That part of t he land where I commenced
planting was in a highly cultivated and good
so'l, rather s'iff and tenacious. *
I began planting my cuttings the 15 h of
March. Thesp were planted in drills, on
a ridge a little elevated above the surface ;
they were covered about an inch and a half
above the eye, and as scon as the ground
was sufficiently dry it was rolled with a
wooden hand roller ; this loft the compact
earth about an inch above the eye. My
reasons for covering at th s depth and for
rolling were io guard ngainsi die drouth,
should drouth come, for such extraordinary
cold nnd long continued storms as afterwards
came on had been seldom before
known, and were not anticipated by me in
that clim-ite. My rirly planting was fin.
ished about the 12th of April. From the
115th of March io the last date there were
occasional long and cold storms. Of this,
my first planting, a very great proportion
ol the chtungs finally perished iu lite earth, 1
and were l<>st.
About the 10th of April I returned norh,
and sent on from tho icea large quantity of
cuttings sufficient (o finish the whole field ; j
these wero s<'t out between the 20th of
April, and the 1st of May, in a noil ruTTtW '
less consistent and ruber more sandy than
the first part of the fi Id, which was planted. I
They were covered with earth about an i
inch above the eye, the earth compressed I
lighily but not rolled hard ; showers follow- <
cd, and this late (tinting, for that climate, 1
succeeded admirably ; not one perhaps, in
twenty cuttings faded.
At a still l?t*rperiod, I sent on a few 1
thousand trees from the nor.h, to replant n
part of my ground wh ch had failed of my
first planting. A part of these trees were 1
cut up into cuttings, and a part were laid
horizontally, tlw b.nhw?
incTi deep ; all these were planted in June.
This last mode is an admirable and safe
one. All of this very late plnnting su -ceded
well. Cuttings which wero planted
very early in this part of Virginia seem to
havefured worst of all in soils rather clayey
- - * . r? 1.
and retentive ot moisture, ai ronsmwu u.
Dr. Butt planted a co isiderable field of cut
lings in the latter part of March, in a very
rich coal.black soil, composed almost exclusively
of a large p oportion of vegetable
mould, mixed with a small proportion of
sand ; these succeeded well. On another
inulb rry plantation of the R-v. Mr. Jon?is,
at the same place, tiiu cuttings were planted
at the same season, in a soil composed nl.
most exclusively of a large proportion of
sand, and but a small proportion of vegetable
mould. In this poorer soil the cuttings
appear to have suffered least of all from the
cold storms, as they succeeded admirably.
The most suitebl soil for the cuttings is
a soil composed of a mixture ot part sand
and pnrt vege'able mould. The cuttings
s1 ould b cut on qarterofan inch above the
eye, and aAcr inserting it vertically in the
earth, it should be trodden hard, and covered
with about an inch of loose mould. If
iho season is wet a id there is a prospect of
more rain, let the cuttings be planted in a
ridge a little elevated above the surface ; if
on the contrary the earth should be dry at
the time of planting with no immediate
prospect of rain, lei the cutting be planted
on a level with the surface, and covered ra-i
J
mer ueep.
The cuttings should he immersed in wa_
ter at the moment of plan ing out, but by no
means should they be steeped in water during
twenty-four hours, as some have directed
; sueh a practice is utterly destructive
to the vitality* of the cutting.
But the most sure and certain mo le of
propag t'i.igthe Morus Multicnulis isto bury
the body of the free horizontally, fixing thr
roots nt a proper depth. In Northern
States the bodies should be covered but halt
an inch, or an inch, but in the Southern
States an inch and a half, or rather deeper,
in a dry sandy soil. Thus planted, and at
the suitable time, I have never, in any season,
known this system fail, as the root will
thus preserve the vitality of the lop, and in.
sure its growth. Tin; buds on the uudcri
side of the tree thus horzonially laid, will
lie dormant, but they only sleep, and under
more favorable circumstances, will start
from the root one 01 two years after. About
half the buds or eyes of the trees, thus laid,
will grow and form fine trees, with fine roots,
by Autumn. Of nil the modes of raising the
Morus Multicaulis, I consider this as one of i
the most sure. I have never in a single instance
known it to fail of producing an ab
return. Very Respect fully,
William Kbvricit.
Newton, Muss, August 26, 1839.
From the Farmers's Register, for September.
The high prices obtained at Mr. Physick's
sale are likely to have an injurious
effect on the market. These prices,added
to the previous panic, and consequent anxiety
of many persons to sell, have caused an
immense number of trees to be advertised
for sale, and at auction, and for cush.or very
short paymen s; This roost impolitic
course, offorcing sales six or seven months
before they can possibly be wonted for
planting, (their only use, so early,) will at
least t<st the vital powers of the commodity ;
and if prices are not for a time reduced to
one half, or to less, by this glutting of a before
dull market, then it may be relied on
that there is an intrinsic value in the article,
surpassing the speculative demand, nnd that
nothing can destroy its market. And th?3
forcing of sales is to be done at a time
when the United S:utes Bank post notes are
selling at 24 per cent, discount, and th
best public securities and sfoeks at prices
jnprecedentedly low, compared to their acknowledged
value as investments ; and when
- ? ? _ I?

is openly recommended by a commercial
paper in New York, to alleviate the intolerable
existing pecuniary pressure. If, uuder
iu< h circumstances, tho producers of whea
were to insist upon selling the next surplus
crop of the country six months before it
could be put to any use, it would certainly
put down the price to less than half the expected
future rates.
The result which this most impolitic procedure
may produce, of a temporary prostration
of prices, would be as injurious to
public as to private interests. The foundation
of silk culture is now laid so firmly and
broadly, that nothing will prevent the structure
being finally erected ; and this would
secure good prices for trees, not only f
tais year, hut also for the next, even if there
were not a s ngle individual speculator in the
market. But asudden depression now, wou
cause the erroneous irnprssion to be mad*
an the public mind that tho udvocates of silk
culiure had lost confidence in its value and
profits, and would thus serve :?t least to retard
its general or extensive establishment.
We bole-ve that every tree raised in the
rouutry next year will be wanted to supply
the aetual demand for feeding silk-worms,
or to make provision for the future feeding.
And if so, the lowest price that can well be
conceived, even five cents the tree, will give
a very good profit to the planters of southern
stock at 50 cents, or at the highest prices
yet obtained or asked, this season in
Virginia. The general price of the young
white mulberry trees in France is n franc a
piece, (about 19 cents.) though that kind has
been cultivated there for sale and for feed,
irrg. forsomrr ccn*trrr?*!f. Wtry tlmj, if wanled
for use at nil, should not the morus mul[icauiis,
which is intrinsically worth so much
m< re, nnd as early a-; 1840, sell for onethird
at least, and more probably two-thirds,
or more of the regular price of die morus
nlbi in France? The occurence of 'his result
will not depend on the action of speculators,
nor he prevented by a present depression
of price, if caused by the means above
mcn'ioned ; but will be founded on the actual
operations of, and the certain and undoubted
profits to be derived from s Ik culture.
With the success of this culture,
ua ? |.u.ti.lia<n, wo may pruiluuiiO"
that everv present holder of trees may safe
ly withdraw from the market keep his trees
until next spring, (and standing in the fields
if in Virginia or more south,) if no purchaser
ofT r sooner and ihen, if not sold, convert
lie whole stock to plantings, nnd he
may count on greater profits from the crop
than from pursuing the opposite course. On
the other hand, it is not necessary to repeat,
what we have often said already, thnt without
the establishment of siik culture, or its
success btin/T in certain orosnecf. the
" O '
whole mulbeiry cultivation and trade

A trance op a week's duration.
A young girl residing in a house hack of
German street, between Fourth and Fifth
streets, Southwark, a member of the
Methodist Church known as the Academy,
in Fourth 9treetnear Arch on the evening
of Wednesday, the 25th ultimo! arose from
hor bed under religious excitement, and be.
gan to pray. The religious exercises, with
the workings of her own imagination, produced
such a state of excitement in her mind
as to tiirow her into a trance, in which condition
she has remuiaed since yesterday
week, insensible fo every object and event
around her. During that period she has
partaken of no food, except such aliment as
ihin gruel, which her friends and attendants
force into li< r mouth between her clenched
teeth. Such a long period of unconsciousness
and abstinence has had no apparent
rff'd upon her health; she breathes regiu.
larly, her respiration is similar to that of a
person in a deep sleep, and her cheeks and
lips have the glow and hue of health, the
ruddy color of which, added to a face pos.
sessing regularity of feature, gives her an
ex'remely interesting and beautiful appearance.
The only motion that has been observed
during this length of time by those
around her is a movement of the head,
which is turned occasionally from one side
to the other, as she lies upon her back, and
a rapid rolling of ihe eyeballs, under the
closed lids. Site has now been eight days
in this singular state, and seems no nearer
a restoration to a state of conciousncsa than
at the lime of the first attack, though yesterday
one of her attendants heard her whisper
indistinctly something about her broth,
er, which made them believe t iat the fit of
unconsciousness was near its termination.
She has been visited by five or six physicians,
though it is notknowo to what they ascribe
her present condition. Whatercr may have
been (he cause which produced and contin..
ues this singular effect, there is one thing
certain, (hat the facts detailed by her friends,
in regard to her pr sent condition, are strictly
to he depended on. The name of the
girl is Nancy Simpson. (Philad. Ledger.3
The latest advices from Bombay, (East
Indies,) state that the cholera is making
dreadful ravages in that quarter. Death
often supervenes in one hour after the attack
; and to crown the distress, die inhabitants
are suffering under a great scarcity
of water most of ihe wells being dry*
A SINGULAR CASE.
A man named Alanson Theodore Her?
rick, has confessed before a magistrate of
Easton that he is the murderer of Zellerbach,
the pedlnr, for whose death Kobler
has been convicted and sentenced to be
hung. He related particularly the manner
in which he committed the deed, the mode
in which he disposed of the goods, die,
and the places he has visited since, and
said the awful convi< lions of his conscience
had induced him to confess the deed,? *
When told that Kobler had confessed the
deed, Merrick said, "that if Kobler was ?
willing to die for him he would not confess,
as there was no use of both dying."

The public will wo think learn with surprize,
that Messrs Ruiz and Montez, of the
Island of Cuba, who were overpowered by
their slaves on board the Spanish acboooer
Am's nd, and from whom they were rescued
by a U. S. ship of war, afW enduring the
most horrid tortures?are now suffering incarceration
in the common jail io this
city.
And for what ? it will be asked f Have
these gentlemen been guilty of any crime
among us? Have they committed any
wrong here ? None, whatever.?They held
slaves in Cuba, but this the laws of Cuba
sanctioned. They purchased slaves in
Cuba and transported them from one part of
the island to another. This loo the laws of
Cuba sanctioned. When fortunately res,
seued from impending death, by a gallant
officer of our Navy, thoy claimed the slaves
as their property?and th?s question of
property, is now in a course of adjudication
before our courts of law.
Yet, is i a f?cl that they were yesterday
both arrested in a civil suit by a process issuing,,
one, from the Court *of Common
Plans and, another, from the Superior Court,
on the assumed complain* of 44 Fulah, an
African of the Mendi Tribe, and Singwth,
an African of the Mendi^Tribe/'for44 imprisoning,
healing and wouodjog them,"
and the joint damages laid at $9900. On
wh'ch process Messrs. Ruiz and Montez
are now confioed in jail.
The Savages, in whoso name these suits
are institu ed, are of course ignorant of the
whole matter. A lifetime would not suffice
to make them comprehend it.?The real
plaiouflk are the abolrtion:?fa, and the foremost
tut usual amongst them is Mr. Lewis
Tuppan ! who actually- accompanied the
Sheriff's officer who served the writ to point
out to him ihc persons of the Spanish gentlemen.
He of course would not lose this
opportunity of adding to the enviable notoriety
ho already enjoys!
