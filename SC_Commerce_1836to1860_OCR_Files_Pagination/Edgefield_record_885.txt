strongly of having formed a close intimacy
with the brandy bottle-and a pot Ely gentleman,
of about forty, with good humored countenf

MENTAL COURAGE.
Moral and ithoysical courage are gene
rally understood and appreciated, btit
there is a kindred attribute which my be
denominated mental courage ; and the for
mer are not more indispetisible in the
eommon relations of lite, ihat is thedi'tee
to the- ticcesstul pursuit of knowleIge,
and diseipline of ihd mind. It itiplies a
hearty readiness, anti alacrity to all' kind.,
ot intellectual work, n ib the pow'ver ibld
the will to apply the forces of the mind
with steady and persevering vigor,. in
inanifestiig ditliculties. Much may doubt
less be done to promote this habit (if mind,
by a jidicious method of insiruction-telc
true ibject of wiich is not to rielieve the
student of the necessity of labor,b'ut to
direct n il tiinulate him to tle fse of his
aleft) the'b.Ior7v
oPfime, maode the folluoti"g remark to
his son on the subject : "No itan deserves
to lenen anything ni hich lie does not prin
cipally work out fir himself; and the hu
sine-ss of the instructer is to help nie schis
far out of otherwise inexplicaple diflicul
ties."
The formation of ibs habit mist, how
ier. depend principally in the student
himself. And in order to acquire it, the
mind should grapple vigorously with such
difficulties as occur, before extraneous aid
ofany kind is called in. The student
must expect to climb the .hill, and swin
the flood, and thread i lie lorest, in his in -
irllectual progress, as well as to wajk over
the smooth and level plain. And % hen
lie cores upon such difficihies, lie should
not to( re'adily take thw arm of an other,
but boldly and patiently try his own strength
upon it first. If lie succeeded i.. inaste
ring it. the acquisition will be much more
secure and valuable to him. It is thi se
very difficultiies, with the patient labor
itey require, n hich principally educate

these dilficuiieh4, lhether of language or

Liquoring.-Wiuthin a few months past
we have nioticeit in the travelliing public an
increased disposition to "liquor," at the
dhiffe-rent posts where the materiel can h'e
obtained. The old fashioned piocket tick
lers are hegining again to be introduced
and we ovrselves have been invited to
partiiiate '"by word of month," of the
strong sceted drug, by a fellow travellet
in the rail road car, and have listened to a
if. :ful coimplaintt of another, because ii
~...s not furnuished as a whetter to his ap.
petite foi- breakfast.
From ibhe.e anid other 'signs ofthe
times," we have reason to appreh~end thai
on the subject of Temtperance, there is a
retrograde movement-tha t the ".escensus
.averoi-lhe descent to drunkenntess-is
r easy; and that many more amiotng the re

thither than is generally supposed -We
' allude to the subject that the friends o'

f evil may not suppose the victory is secure.

buand.-There has beeh a great deal
said of late as to the usefuluese and depos
iles of Guan-o; all of which deserve the at
tention of the agriculturists, gardener, and
the enterprize; still we are of opinion that
people should not run wild after a foreign
article whu it can lie procured nearer
home, andl of as good a qua!ity. To ex
plain the origin of this manure to our rea
ders who do not understand the name and
nature of the saine, we will simply inen- -
tion, that Guano is taken from an Island
called Ichabooe; and courains, as the sail
ors say, "the father of all dunghills an
enorinous mass of bird's manure, lyina 3
feet deep on the greater part of the island,

But as we were going to say; there is
just such manutre, on an island In Lake

a bulk at any one of these deposites, as
there is on the island of lkhahoe: ihuiugi
