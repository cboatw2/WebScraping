? QUALITY OF MILK.
Several crops have been successively
filled while milking from one cow, producing
the following results ; in every case,
the quantity of cream was found to increase
in proportion as the process of milking
advanced : in different cows, the proportion
varied, but in the greater number
the excess of cream in the last cup as
compared with the first, was as 16 to 1:
but, as in some cases the difference was
not so much, a fair average might be considered
as ten or twelve to one. And
the difference in the quality of the two
sorts of cream was no less striking, the
cream given by the first drawn milk being
thin, white, and without consistence,
while that furnished by the last was thick,
buttery, and of a rich color. The milk
remaining in the different cups presented j
similar differences, that which was drawn
first being very-poor, blue; and having
the appearance of milk and water, while
that in the last cup was of a yellowish
hue, Tich, and to the eye and taste resem- 1
bled cream rather than milk. It appears,
therefore, from these experiments, that if,
after drawing seven or eight pints from a
cow, half a pint remains in the udder, not
only almost as much cream will be lost.
es the seven or eight pints will
famish, but of such a quality as gives the
richest taste and color to the butter. This
fact has been corroborated by chemical
experiments, and holds good with respect
to the milk of all other animals.?blackera

/'A cempr&niise of the Bank question is
spoken of hy the friends of that measure
who have heretofore differed as to the
Hrjitncking p*wer. Jt \a proposed to mqdi.
fy the amendment offered by Mr. Rives,
so as to require the assent of the States
to the estabfuhment of branches, but re.
serving to Congress the. power to estab.
litfh branches, by special law, wherever
they may he necessary for the convenience
of the government. Those who
objected to Mr. Rives' amendment, as an
abandonment of constitutional power, will
be reconciled by this provision. It is
supposed that the hill, thus framed, will
in the House and come to the
Senate; but the amendment may be offered
in the Senate.
Mr. Calhoun was to speak yesterday
nn the Bank question and to oiler aorne
amendments, but Mr. Clay moved to
take up the Loan Bill. Mr. Calhoun
wished to go on with the Bank bill till it
was disposed of. Mr. Clay said the state
of the Treasury was such as to require
I he passage of the Loan bill. The expenditures
were at the rate of two millions
a mouth, and there was hut $900,000 in
the Treasury?which would not last a
fortnight. Some time would be occupied,
too, io obtaining the loan.

Mr. Benton and Mr. king both proposed
to Mr. Clay to take the Bank out
of committee on Saturday night, have it
printed, and take the final question on it
Monday night?but. they required that
the interval should he devoted to the .bill.
The conversation was cut, off by the
motion af Mr. Berrien to go into Executive
session, abouthalf-pasteleven o'clock.
Mr. Calhoun opposed the motion, as he.
wished to proceed with the Bank bill, but
being assured thflt the business was important,
he withdrew his objections. The
whole of the remainder of the day was
passed in secret session.
' The House occupied the day with the
discussion of the Fortification bill, but it
was not disposed of.
There is a rumor that Mr. Fox has
contingent instructions to ask his passports
in case McLeod is sent to tried.
Much anxiety is felt here on the subject.
Washington, July 17.
It is denied here that the British Minister,
Mr. Fox, has any instructions, as has
been rumored, which will render it necessary
for him to take anv course of an un
friendly character towards this governrucnt,
in consequence of the present
aspect of the M'Lcod case. It is asserted
that the British government will be satisfied
with the disposition exhibited by our
government in relation to the matter*
Our relations with England, were alluded
to in the debates yesterday, and in a
spirit of harmony and patriotism that is
auspicious for the public welfare.
I make one or two extracts from the
discussion.
Mr. Cushing, in reply to some remarks
of a previous day, from Mr. Rhett, questioned
the correctness of Mr. It's position,
that the real difficulty between the government
of the United States and Great
Britain, had arisen under:his Administration.
The demand for the !?! ?' ation of
M'Leod was made on the 13th December,
nearly three rhonlbs before the late administration
went out of pow^r; and Mr.
Pickens' celebrated report treated it as a
solemn matter, presenting an issue of
peace or war. Mr. C expressed his high
gratification at the patriotic and honorable
tone of the remarks of Mr. Rhett in
regard to his readiness to stand by the
country whenever its honor should be assailed,
and he regretted that the question
should ever have been mooted as to what
administration it was, under which a national
difficulty should have arisen. B;tt
as the question had been raised, he desired
that the facts should be accurately
stated and understood. Should a solemn
public question grow out of the existing
state of things, he trusted the Committee
on Foreign Relations would continue to
present, as- on all such questions it had
hitherto presented, an undivided front,
Mr. Rhett disclaimed any intention, in
the remarks he had made, to impute blame
to the present administration, or commendation
to that which had lately been in
power as to this M'Leod controversy; and.
under which of them the question had be
come so serious .a matter, was perfectly
immaterial. In reference to the lastvdernand
of the British government for the
immediate release of McLeod, "Mr. R
said?* It was this letter and Mr. Webster's
answer to it which constituted the
issue between the two nations; and in relation
to that issue it was his own opinion
that one- of the two nations must recede^
or el^e a resort to war seamed, inevitable."
' "Mt. Pickens made- an explanation of
the history of his report, a fid in conclusion
said, He could not entirely agtec
wfth his colleague, Mr. Rhett, lq what he
had*said as to the issue between the countries
being such that one or the' other of
them must recede, or sacrifice its honor.
He considered the demand by Mr. Fox
as having been made in a remarkably
cautious manner. The language was
guarded ; and lie did not consider it as
precluding all adjustment of the question
without directly abandoning the grounds
taken. Great delicacy and caution were
in fhn If-o nf lunmiatTP. nnd
main icoi in ^uvivv vi
Mr. P did not think the government so
entirely com mi ted as his colleague seemed
to suppose. He hoped McLend would
l?e found innocent, and acquitted. But
he trusted in God, for the honor and in.
dependence of the State of New York,
and the sanctity of its Juciciary, that he
would be tried.
Mr. M'Keon suggested that the British
government, after learning that the judiciary
of the State of New York would
probably deem it proper to wait the re.
suit of JtfcLeod's trial. That government
was prudent, and would ponder well
the mutual interests of both nations ir. a
state of peace. She couM not nut krott
the state of the American mind, avrl
that, armed or unarmed, v? were ready
to defend our rights at all times; and
must be aware that no p??wnr on ear.!)
could get McLeod out of the hands of the
judiciary of tho State of New York i ill
he xvas delivered by due course of law.
He expressed his hope that McL ^J
would be able to prove an alibi, and so be
aoquited. And as to the other question
of the Caroline, he did not think it likely
to lead to war. He anno meed his purpose
to pursue the subject from week to
week, till he should see some.satisfaction
for this outrage on our righ's. As long as
he had a seat in Congress he should in.
sist on the right of New York to try McLeod,
and, if guilty, to execute him; and
he should then render all the aid in his
power to the present administration, in
demanding redress from the Britjsh government
for the attack on the Caroline.
In the Senate, the same subject was
remotely alluded to by eeycrnl memhersMr.
Walker said the critical state of our
relation# with England rendered doubly
critical by the late decision of the Supreme
court of New York?rendered it
necessary to take some steps towirds putting
the country in ( a. state of defentte.
He did not think the twelve million loan
was necessary for current expenses; but
he would vote for it^ '* With a provision
that the excess should' go for ttje Armament
of fortifications or increase of the
navy. ' ' *
The loan bill was taken up itl the Senate
and discussed for some hours, when
the Senate went into Executive session.
The House discussed the fortification
bill, and passed an order for taking it
out of committee to-day, at 2 o'clock*
Washington July, 18th.
fnthe House, yesterday, Mr. Arnold
of Tenn., moved to reconsider the resolution
for taking out of committee, at 2
o'clock, the Fortification bill. He said it
was useless for the House to hurry its
business. There were breakers ahead.
Though the House was prepared to do
! the business which the people required,
vet great obstacles would delay business
in the Senate. He had been informed by
a distinguished Senator [meaning f/Lr.
Clay] that it was doubtful whether the
great measure df the session could pass.
The Virginia doctrines were in th* ascendant.
While Mr. A, was making remarks
of this sort, he was repeatedly called
to order, and many members interrupting
him. The Locos cried out, "Cod
grant it may be so." Mr. Botts exclaimed?"
Wait for ten days, and you will
find yourself mistaken." Finally Mr.
Arnold, was stopped. The previous
question was moved and seconded by the
casting vote of the Speaker. The resolu-,
tion was reconsidered and withdrawn. |
Washington, Jclv 18.

which President Tyler invites into the

in the House by Mr. Arnqldt of Ten.,' oe

Mr. Speaker, I have been. induced to

I
MOST EXTRAOHDINABY TRANSACTIONSUMMARY
EXECUTION BY THE POPULACE.
The facts that a drover of Kentucky,
named Utterback, had been nearly murdered,
and robbed, and4 that two men
named Maythe and Couch had been arrested
on suspicion ofbeing the perpetrators
of the outrage, were published in cur
paper last week; and we now learn that
both the accused have already fallen
victims of populas wrath, by execution,
without trial or even indictment, and
while their victim was still alive, and the
possibility of his recovery existed. These
extraordinary facts were communicated
to the Cincinnati Republican by a highly
respactahle citizen of Kentucky, who had
the details of the transaction from several
persons who witnessed them; and from
(hat paper we gather the following particulars.
At the time of the execution, the prisoners
had been in confinement in the jail
in Williamstown, Grant county, Ky., on
the above charge. Mr. Utterback, it
seems, has been lingering in a miserable
state?his throat having been shockingly
mangled?at a tavern some three or four
miles beyond Williamstown, on a much
travelled road, and an object of commiseration
with every passer by. He is a citizen
of Bourbon, the adjoining county to
Grant, and where the excitement has
been increasing ever since the attempt to
murder him. It being problematical,
however, whether Mr. Utterback might
not survive?although in such restored
situation as to he neither useful to himself
nor fellow men?the uncertainty increased
whether the utmost penalty of the
law would be visited upon the prisoners,
nothing less than which, it seemed, would
pacify the people of Bourbon. Many o!
the citizens of that county, therefore, de
libcrately resolved upon the summarv
execution. They first deputed ten citi.
zens of the county to visit Williamstown
and inform tha citizens of the place, anc
the prisoners particularly, that at such i
time the prisoners were to be executed.
This notice wns thirty-six hours previous
to the actual execution, and a clergyman
was also sent, and actually went to the
prison, for religious converse with the
prisoners.
On Saturday, in pursuance of the no.
' tice, about 500 citizens of Bourbon, tc
which were added some from Scott anc
Uarriatn rnnnfipfl. went into Williams
i??l nevu ?
town in solemn procession and most per
feet order. They had chosen their sher
iff* to act for the occasion, and pro
ceeded to the jail, and demanded the pris
, oners, Maythe and Couch. The sherif
of Grant refused to give them up, or th<
keys of the prison: he offered however n<
other resistance, and the people at one*
broke open the doors. They then tool
the prisoners, placed them in an nper
wagon, their irons on them, took up thei
line of march without the least noise m
confusion, to the spot of ground where th<
murder was attempted, about four mile
, distant. By this time the number as
sembled was believed to have been a
least two thousand. After arriving on th<
ground, Mr. O'Hara, a member of the bar
1 addressed the people for some time upot
the propriety of permitting the low ti
take its course. He was listened to witl
' the utmost silence and respect, but with
1 out apparently altering the determinatioi
I of . a single person present. Tho prelim
inaries were then adjusted and the pris
I oners asked if they had anything to sn;
. previous to the closing of their earthl;
accounts. One of thorn, Maythe, ad
dressed a few remarks to the people, ad
! mitting the commission of the act fc
I which thoy were to suffer, denying, how
i ever, that it was his wish to commit ac
i tual murder. Religious service was the
j j performed by a clergyman present, an
1 Mavthe and Couch were hung in thei
I /?J ? irons
upon a tree standing over the nam
, 8pot where their crime* was committed.Rude
coffins were constructed and tlier
they were buried. The crowd then di<
persed in the same perfect order.
i When we add, that one of the crimir
5 als, Maythe, has been long known b
many citizens of Ohio and Kentucky i
a man of notoriously bad character?hai
ing been confined at different times an
3 escaped from the penitentiaries of bot
j States?we have stated all the facts an
, whatever there may be of a palliating n<
ture in this case.
The following paragraph, which w
f copy from the N. Y. Sun, furnishes a
5 example of the manner in which souther
s slave owners nre sometimes robbed ?
i their property. This is an evil whic
I calls much more loudly for indignatio
31 and action from southern members <
Congress than the petitions cT worne
and children which annoy them 2
much.
^ ANOTHER RUNAWAY SLAVE AFFAIR.

on l>oard, unknown to the officers ai

matter, and manifested some eicitement
about it, which terminated in their pw?- ,

P because it is just the time we can realize
how much they are needed, for if we ptyt
r off a consideration of it until the proper ,
' time for transplanting, we may then /<*

L as the fellow did at whose cabm a gert.,,
, tleroan called to g*t shelter from* hard
i rain, he found on entering that the-rain.

and the owner swing in mo vm; rr?vv
where it did not leak, scratching wwjr

Why, because said be when itdon't. rain

row of good shade trees, the question artV
r ses, how can it he done? . *1
9 I will suggest for your consideration5
three plans: First?Pass a law (if yon
| have the right so to do) requiring every
9 owner of a lot or lots to plant, next Feb*
, runry or March, a row of trees opposite .
i his lots, and if any lots are owned by pes'
sons not living here, let the Council hive
trees planted in front of all such, and lay
n n tax upon them sufficient to pay the ex
pense.
'* Skcond flak?Let the Town Cenhci!
\ undertake tbc business, let out the conj.
tract to the lowest bidder and pay the
I. whole expense by an additional.!** if fee
,r cessarv, on real estate.
m 9 . ,,
Thud Plan?If neither oT the abovn
? are feasible, lot it be done by general
d , subscription, and as every own, woman
if and child vrill be benefitted by it, surely
r there will be no difficulty in raising a
sufficient amount. The cost will be much
t* less than many uotild suppose, a mere
trifle compared to the benefit; each aynri,
'* contains I believe 12 lots, the distance
^ from corner to corner being 600 feet of *
fm 2400 feet til round, at the distance of 20
d feet apart (which is probably too close) it

or loss per Ireo, making the cost per

T I trust the subject may be deemed of 4
sufficient importance to awaken an inter*
est in the citizens and induce you to take
