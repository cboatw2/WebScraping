PROSPECTUS
or the
LITERARY BVLLETIIV. >i
Charleston, 8. C.
IN offering to the patronage of tite public, a/aew
literary paper, ore are |?rfoctly aware tMgcwe
are but repeating au oft-tried experiment, flfcresuit,
however, we would fain bclievo, will bo (jiftrent.
We are, it is true, oonscious of .he pjjsiitrion
of no talent or ability superior to thai of oaf predecessors,
but we rely, (perhaps, indeed, iy?h too
much of the ardor of all experiments,) upon the iu? {
creasing taste of the age or literature ; a faste, the
evidence of which is before us in the hortioer of pe- j
riodioals, erirrajred solely in its cultivation?in the j
lyceuns, the libraries and academies devoted to science
an I learning. Whilst the North ttud the
West are thus assidioudly employed in the exemplar?
task of mental improvement, we will not sappose
that tho South intends longer to bear trie
weight of that heavy iucumbus which heretofore
lias whelmed it in an intelleetaal slumber more
lasting and profound than that physical one which
orcwiitio enwrapped the seven sleepers of typhosus.
It is with a iiope thus founded, and with an intention
if wo cannot win success, at least to deserve
it; iliai notwithstanding the uniform failure of those
who have preceded us, we have ventured to claim
the patronage and to labor for the np.ilausc of the
public. The stake shall be played for; how the
gauie is to end, time only pan determine.
Our object will be to render the columns of the
illettn both useful and amusing. For this pu:pose,
while one portion is devoted to original Essays,
Tales and Poems, furnished from time to time
by our correspondents and -collaborators, another
portion shall be occupied by selected matter cuned
from every spot of interest and instruction! in llio
vast field of literaturo.
The productions of the press shall pass in teview
before us, and on every work whioh merits our
notice, an impartial criticism shalt be bestowed.?
To light literature and-to learned science shall alike
lie meted their due portion of censure or of praise,
and it shall not be our faults if our patrons do not
know the intrinsic value of every book, (at icast in
onr own opinion) before they begin to read.
fie, says Dr. Franklin, who is good at excuses, is
seldom good at any thing else; and the same we
opine may be said of promises; lost therefore our
roadeis come to some such conclusion as this, we
will, without further ado, make our bow, and leave
them in future to judge from our labors whether we
do, or de not, deserve their patronage. '

(ESTA BUSHED IN 1(34.)^
A popular and highly ojtcrmed MagasinC of General
literature and the Fine Arts?einhelished
with gorgeous and costly Engravings, on Steel,
Oi?'ni|KT and Wood; and also with Fashionable
and Popular iViitsic, arranged for the Piano-Forte,
Guitar and Hacp.
EDITORS,
Mrs. Ann S. Stephens.
William W. Snowden.
Assisted by many of the most popular writers.
income publication ot toe may numocr, me ue(5
inand tor the Ladies' Companion, has been unprecedented
and beyond the most sanguine anticipations.
At the commencement of the volume an additional
nuin!?er of copies were printed, which was
considered at the lime adequate to satisfy all the
orders which might be rccoived, and leave a considerable
number on hand ior subsequent calls. The
publisher is more than graiified in stating that the
whole edition wus nearly exhausted before the issuing
of the seventh jiumber of the volume; and at
tins time but very lew complete sets remain on
hand, to supply the numerous orders which are
doily received from every section of the U. S.
In consequence of this great unforseen increase of
new subscribers, ho has determined to double the
number of impressions for the subsequent year;
while he most gratefully-appreciates the unprecedented
encouragement extended to the Ladies' Companion,
und at th? same lime, he begs to assure the
readers of the magazino and the public in general,
that it is his ardent resolution to meet it with a cor
resoonuigg liberality on iiis part to merit iu continuance.
SPLENDID STEEL ENGRAVINGS
by our best artists, cconipany c:.ch numoer?illustiated
by Tales anil spirited Sketcues?which will,
as heretofore, continue to be magnificent an.) fur
superior to those published in any other magazine in
America. ~
The Ladies' Companion contains a larger quantity
of reading than any other magazine issued in this
country, and its subscription price's only three dollars
a year, while the great combination of ta.ent
secured for the coming year will render it unequalled
by any other periodical.
ITS LITERARY CHARACTER!
Will undergo consideiablc change, as the publisher
of the Laeies' Companion, in order to show his
appreciation of the public favor already extended to
hiiu so liberally, has secured tlie aid of
Mrs. Ann S. Stephens'
late Editor ol tho "Portland Magazine," and author
of a scries of the most beautiful a.id |>opular talcs 1
ever presented to an American public. No lady 1
possessing greater variety of talent, or better calcu- 1
iated to aid in conducting a ladies magazine could
have been selected from the galaxy of female genius
which is ihc glory of our country. In addition to
the poweiful talents of iStrs. Stopiu ns, the proprietor
lias secured a list of contributors, which combined
will render the Ladies' Compa ion one ol the most
interesting and talented magazines of the uay.

THE MUSI AL DEPAR f MEN 1' i
I |
Is under the supervision of Mr. J. Watson, whose ,
qualifications for the task are too well known t rc- 1
quire our testimony.
This department of the Ladies' Companion, has ' 1
over commanded a large share of attention, and has -1
been looked upon with no little interost by its rea- j
dors, and more especially the Ladies, whom the
publisher is in the highest legrcc anxious to please.
It will continue to nc a subject of more than usual
care to him, and to the Professor under whose supervision
it is placed, to make that portion of the
magazine allotted to music, more than ever doserviug i
of tTic countenance of every lover of music. It has
ever been and will continue to he the desire to have
all pieces of music-printed correctly and free frotu
errors.
THE WORK IN GENFR \L.
Over every department an equally careful mper i
vision will he strictl exercised hy the Editors, and ;
all appropriate expenditures will he liberally bestowed ]
as it is the design of the publisher, with the aid of his
contributors and the advice of his friends-to make1
the Ladies' Companion distinguished for tne beauty
and accuracy of its typography?the variety and
high tone of its liter 4ry articles?ilie qualit. and
value of its music?and '.lie unequalled splendor oi
its pictorial embeliahments.
It is the deter illation of the publisher to use every
means to matut ti l toe superiority which the Ladies'
'ompanion has obtained. For four y.ears he
has steadily pursued a course ot improvement, and
he flatters himself that his present facilities arc such
astogivethe laddies'Co opinion e oinent advantages
over all other publications of its character.
From the foregoing it will be perceived that the
Ladies' Companion embraces every department within
the range of Belles-Lett res and the Fine Arts;
and no exertions or ex|?ense will l>e deemed toe great
to render tlie work equal to any other extant. The
flattering and {general testimonials of nearly every
contemparary journal in the United States, and in
fact, many on the other side of the Atlantic, have
strongly asserted the Undeniable claims of the La*
dies' ' 'ompanion tothn support of the public general* i
ly. There is no work that gives its readers such a
great return for their sulmcripii >u.
The Prize Articles will all be published during the

: Gin ?an be made double, or angle. If
JL nude double, they reduce labor, end gin just
double ^the quantity of ootton oyer the single cylinder
Gin, no other knd having been in use prevous
to tins patent; and whether single or double, they
are found to improve the quality of the cotton, by
more perfectly cleaning it. They can be made to
coutaiu from &) to 100 saws in a stand, and whether
small or lagge, ou? hand will be sufficient to uttend
them. The 'Gins have mechanical feeders and
hbpperd attached to tliein, which free the cotton
front leaves, trash, dirt, &c. before it can reach the
saws, and by the thorough hackling operation it
receives froin the feeders, which make two revolutions
to one of the saws, it is almost in a half
gined slate, before it descends to the saw. By a
very simple arrangement of a screw to each set of
gaates, on which the hoppers rest, and through
winch the teeth of the feeders pass, they can be
inude to teed slow or fast to suit the condition of
the cotton at the time. When made double, the
saws are placed on two sets of cylinders and turn
upon each other in opposite directions, and are
cleansed by two sets of brushes that have tour revo>
lutions to one of* twe saw. The two cylinders can
be detached so as to enable the planter to ruu one
or both at pleasure, although embraced with feeders,
<&c. in one stand. The whole is put in operation
with a drum and band, as in the ordinary Gin, and
may be propelled by horse, steam, or water power.
It inay also be propelled by iron runmr.g gear.'
The force required to work it, is about the same as
that necessary to mov.e an equal nu> .uerot saws in
the common Gin. This Gin uas been put in
operation in New Orleans for I -o or three weeks,
and its success tested in f'tc presence of a large
number of planters, our chants and others, and
received their general rpprobation
Several gentlemen have been ?o kind as to give j
the Patentee their written opinion respecting the
merits of the Gin. A number of others could be
added, but the following are deemed sufficient:

wuat l inir.K ot your improved c-otton uin, i nave ,
to Hay, thui i saw it work on Saturday the25lh inst. :
and was very much pleased with its performance. '
The mere Tact of its self-feeding, seems to ure to
be a very valuable improvement; and besides, the
quality of the cotton, as it comes out of the process,
appeared to me to be belter and cleaner than
from the common Gins in use, and that it saves
cons.derably in labor. Respectfully, dec.
E. L>. WHITE.
From Mr J. Compton, a wealthy planter, resident

Dr. A. Jones?Dear Sir, in reply to your note,
accompanied by a specimen of the cotton, ginned
by your Patent Gin, I beg leave to observe, that it
exhibits a decidt d improvement on the usual process
of ginning ; delivering the staple uninjured
and free troin nap or trash, clean and of good color
; therpby giving the article an additional value.
These favorable impressions of the advantages of
your Patent Gin, have been confirmed by subsequently
witnessing it in operation. The utility ol
the double cylinders and saving of labor, will be
readily pereeived and properlv appreciated by the
intelligent planter
Feeling a deep interest in the success of all improvements
tending to benefit the important staples
of our country, I trust that yours Will meet with
the encouragement it justly merits.

At Co., and near five years spinner in the house of
Messrs. Sandford & Greene, f have seen your
Cotton Gin in operation, and have examined the
cotton ginned by it, and pronounce it better cleansed,
and the staple less injured, than any cotton
that ever came under my observation. It.is completely
ready for the breaker without the aid of the
blower, and would, therefore, save the first process
in manufacturing the article I'consider cotton
cleansed by your Gin. would command from one
to two cents on the pound more than the average
crops brought into the Manchester market and
cleansed by common Gins Yours, very resp'ly.

of planters <n any of the sen port (owns of the cottun

paying the freight on the same from New York,
and becoming responsible for !he amount of the Gin.
It is desirable, when planters give orders for Gins,
they should accompany them with their views in
regard to the arrangement of saws, breasts, brushes,
Ac. It is found they diflcr in opinion Seme
desire saws of larger diameter than others. T he
most common size is 9 or 10 inches ; but some w ish
them 12 inches. Some wish 5 or C rows of brushes
on an axle, while others do not want more than 4
at most. Some wish saws with 8 or 9 teeth to the
Inch, while others want 10 cr 11. With so much
discrepancy, wc prefer they should, at the time of
giving orders, furnish to statement, of their wishes,
and the manufacturerers can fulfil them in'every
particular. Where it is left to our discretion, we
shall make thrm on the most modern and approved
plan An order can be executed, from the time it
is received, in the space uf eight or nine weeks
and the Gin in that time placed in the hands of the
factor To be in time for the next crop, all orders
ought to be in the hands of the manufacturers by
the firRl or middle of May; except for plantations
where they are late in commencing to pick or gin
cotton.
