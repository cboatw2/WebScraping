EXTRACT FROM TILE RJDIARa OF'
MR. I'ICKENS, OF SOUTH CAROLINA,
In the House of :Repreatatires, Jap. 21 183S.
tOn the-Resolution ot3lr. Wise, declaring
that Congresu has io 'poer under the Con
stitution to abolish slavery in the District of
Columbia &c., being .under consideration.
Mr. Speaker: Before we proceed on
this point, it would be well for us to call
t6 Mur minds the circumstances and causes
that indueed the acts of cession granting ju
risdiction in the District. When Congress
was in session in Philadelphia a mob creat
ed great disturbance, and they found them
relves unable, for want of authority, to pro
teet themselves and their officers.. IIence
it became .important that they should have
some territory with exclusive jurisdiction
over it. The object aid sole desire of
Congress was to be able to protect itself,
its oflicers, ad its public buildings, and
make such other municipal regulations as
inight he deemed necessary for the harmo
nly, quiet, and independence of the Gov
ernment. When we look at these circumn
stances, and then compare the clause in the
Cotnstitution conferring legislative power,
we can come to hut one conclusion as to the
-treat leading object of the trust. The
wcords are, that Congress "shall exercise
exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever
over such District (not exceeding ten square
miles), as iay, by cession of particular
States, and the ncceptnice of Congress,
become the seat of Governmtent of the U.
States, and to exercise like authority over
all places purchased by the consent of the
Legislatture of the States in whi'ch the same
shall be, for the recetion of forts, magazines.
arseias, dock-yards, and other needful
buildings."
" Exclusive legislation, " here cannot
mean absolute anil unlimited legislation.
This Government cannot legally exist in
gay piisition without all the restraints of
the constitution finding upon it. It is crc
aied by the constitution, and cannot act in
any sphere except under its specific grants.
And In contend that it has all the powers
here that the States can exercise within
Iheir territories is a solecism in constitutional
lhaw, for the states can exercise all their
powlernot prohibited by the principles and
spirit of theirowni constitations. or the cou
stitution of the United States, while this
Government cn exercise no power not
specifietaly granted by the Constitution, or
absoluately nccessaryto carry into efl'ect some
specific grant, Exclusive legislation means
that no other Government shall have con
current kegislation. Congress shall exer
cise, "like uthority," over all purchased
for forts, arsenals, &c. The legislation
and aitnhority exercised in this District, in
like manner, shall be exercised over places
purchased for firts, &c. If, then, Con
gress is unlimited here, then it is unlimited
in those other places where public works
are. and if slavery can te abolished here,
then, in like mainer, cnn it he abolished iii
all those places in the heart of a State
where there may be public works, &.
All the power intended to be given was to
citable this Government to protect and pre
serve its public works and improvements,
and "like authority" was intended to be
given in this district, authority that nighitbe
esential to carry out the legitimate objects
of the original trust and no more. Any ex
ercise of power heyom the obvious mean.
ing and (plain intentions of the graut of
power at the time it was g'ven, is a viola
tion of its spirit and a per-. ion of its pur
Again : The ninth section expressly ex

power to abholish slavery, then it wa cea

There has' beenu no new acqutireument of

cogn izes themi a's property, as things other
thatn persons. TIhe judicial tribunals of the

States, have all settledm this printciple.

How can ntouoy be drawn from the t

tion by law? There can he no legal ap. I
propriation, except to carry into cl'ect some i
specific power granted by the Constitution, I
or clearly implied as absolutely necessary i
to carry into ellect some specific grant.
There is no specific power to abolish slave- I
ry, & it being itself'a high exercise of sub
stantivo power, cannot be implied as abso- I
lutely necessary in.carry into effect any
other power. As well might we pass ap
propriations to pay the people of this Dis
trict for their cattle and horses, to give thetm
the blessed privilege of running free and
unrestrained over the barren hills and waste
commons around this capitol. As to prin
ciples and power, it is the saute.
But it is said, all the States may eman
cipate, and this District be left without the
means of changing its condition. This is
certainly any thing but a constitutional ar
gumnent, for I anser, that even if this were
to be the case, it is the Constitution, and
and will be so until it is changed by the
imper authorities, There is really no dif
lie'uhty on this point, as those who choose
can now enancipate, by deed or will. In
connection with the constitution, let us for a
moment examine the act of cession from
Virginia. The proviso declares "that no
thing herein contained shall be construed
to vest in the United States any rights of
property in the soil, or to ail'eet the rights
of individuals therein, otherwise than the
same shall, or may be transferred by such
individuals to the~United States." Let it
be understood that this follows immediate
ly after the <laitse describing the tract of
"country and partielnar extent of territory
ceded. I admit the ter ms are somewhat
Cttuivocal at first. If the words "the rights
of individuals therein" refer only back to
control the property in the soil, then they
were of no use ; fhr utmler the Constitution
alone Congress could not have interfered
in tih freehold. One of the first principles
of the Magna Charta is. that no freeman
shall lie deseized of his free hold without
the judgtsent of his peers, I f those words
tmere mteant only to limit the power of the
Governient oer the freehold of a citizen,
then they tro a useless verbiage. Those
who inaerted them must have'meant some
thing mor'e. Vhe.n we look at the sensi
tivetiess of Virgitia on the interesting and
vital subject of the peculiar property of her
citizens she was about to cede, we are led
to believe that she must have meant in the
words " rights of individuals therein," oth
er rights than those of "soil." Connect
this with the clauses in the Constitution,
and no titan can refrain fron anemitting that
it is to say the least of it, it dout fuil power,
w filch every patriot inl n limited Goverment
wouid refrain fronm claiing as under the
Constitution.
But. Mr. Speaker, I take higher ground
than this, and contend that, according to the
hill of rights, of Maryland, and the Consti
tution of Virginia, those States themselves
coubt not have ceded absolute and unre
strained power over private property of any
kind in this District. The citizens of this
District had peculiar rights secured in their
property by the Constitution of' their own
States; and if' Virginia and Maryland had
attempted to cede absolute Iwer over tiis
subject, they would have violated the rights
of their own citizens, and wothl have cotm
nitted not a legal act, but anl act of force.
Next to life andh liberty. these c'itizenes had,
under the parsamount laws of' the adjoirning
States, the righlts of prtopierty seetnred i I
the miost solemn neal unqutalificed tmaniner.

of the use'o which it was to be applied.
'bhe rfle used by.-Mr. Cilley was senie inches
shorter
The greatest secrecy was observcd, and
yesterday norningwvhen Mr. Graves left the
city, he infined his wife that he was going
to attend a public )inner in Baltiissore. But
not witlhstanding their caution, the affairgot
wind, and Mr. Mercer, of Virginia, was at
Illadensburg with Police Olflicers, an hour
before the. nleeting took place. Owing to
this, the parties drove to another place,
ahout three pilles distant, and where there
was no danger of their being molested.
It appears that Wise anl Menilee acted
as seconds to Graves, and BI ynunm and
Calhoun of Ky., for Cilley, They were
iut up about eighty paces, and in such a
position as to fire across the wind, which
was blowing very keen at the imne. The
first and second round was attended with no
cg-et, as it appears they fired too high, and
was mnvh annoyed by-the intense cold and
high wind. At the third fire Mr. Cilly was
shot in the kidney, and instantly fell, break
img the stock from his rifle in the fall. lie
expired in about three minutes afterwards.
It appears that Mr. (lay, of Kentucky,
l'~l!owedl the parties with a view of attempt
ing an amicable adjustment of the matter,
but arrived too late.
Another account is, that an atternpt was
made to adjust the affair after the first fire, it
was renlered iucie'ctual by the reftsal of'
51r. Wise.
Mr. Duncan, of Ohio, attended as Physi
cian, andi he on leaving the ground, is re
norted to have said, "that it wuas a d----d
cold blooded murder and that Webb should
not leave Washington City, if he (Duncan,)
could any how get him to light.''
It is also rummored. that there was much
unfairness in placing Cilley in a had position.
I have no idea that the matter is ended,
and I predict ihat we shall have three or
four tmore duels growing out of the affair.
It is saii that 1mr. Cilley will be buried
to-morrow.--Patriot.
The Washington correspomdent of yes
terday's Mmrcury, gives the following par
ticulars about the unfortunate and gallant
Cilley:
"Air Cilley was shot in the groin on the
third fire, and dlied in a few tiulites. They
fought at lifty paces. A general sadncss
oversprelds the counlienaces of every one.
Deep execratious are uttered against the
ndividual who pushed Mr. Graves into this
confiet. Of the mnanner in which this
bloodv tragedy was got ip, I cannot trtsr
mv:elf to speak. Let mne only amId that you
of tme month have lost a no!'.le, a generous,
:4tmii a brave frieni. Mdr. Cilley was ranked
as a firm, wa:mn-heated, and devoted chant

The Rev. Dr. Brantly has withdlrniva
from the Southern Wattchmnan, and necept
ed the Presidency of the Charleston Col
lege. The Warelmtsan will in future he
united with the Biblical lecorder, and pub
li.shed unler the cditorial tuanagcment of
the Rev. T. Meredith, Editor of the Re
corder.
We publish some account of the death of
Mr. Cilley one of the Representatives from
Maine, in the Congress of the U. States.
But one feeling, and that a feelitng of deep
rcgret prevails at Washington. Mr. C. was
no ordinary man. The Gillowing sketch
from Mr. Williams of the Senate is not un
interesting:
"Mr.Ct LLEY was a native of New Iamp
shire, and uelonged to one of the most au
cient and respectable families in that State.
Patriotism and bravery were his inheritance.
His grand-father was the distitiguished pa
triot. and brave officer of the Revolution,
Gen. Cilley; and his brother Capt. Joseph -
Cilley, was the gallant leader of the heroic
charge tinder Col. Miller, at the battle of
Bridgewater Heights, in the last war.
"The deceased was a gradnate of lhowdoin
College. in llaine,and his superior talents
and application attained for him a high
standing at the bar of that State. Ile was
a good lawyer, an able advocate, and a
powerful debater.
"From early life Mr. Cilley was ardent
ly attached to the principles of free Gov
ernment a zealous advocate of the rights
of the wahole people, and a determined op
ponent of the claim of the few to tyranize
over the many.
"in 1832 Mr. Cilley was elected to the
I louse of Representatives in Maine, and in
1835, and 183G was Speaker of that body,
where his powers andl love of country be
came so conspicnous, that in 1837 he was
elected to Congress in a District in which
the majority was his political opponents.
"Of his conduct here I need not speak,
(ir all who hear me, and all who knew Mr.
Udley in the other end of the Capitol, will
hear testimony to his ability, to his open,
frank. and determined course, to the high
order of his talents and powers as a debater
to the respect antd deference which lie paid
to the rb-ths of others.
"As a moan, Mr. Cilley was warm, ar
lent, aenerouts, noble: ns a fi-iend, true.faith
fttl, abiding. Ile was in the mnteridian of
his life, aged 35; the past was the earne:t of
the future.
"In his death Maine has lost one of her
Urightest ornatientsandutl natinjmjJha.".rt
of a devoted patriot, amid an ardent, zeal
ous supporter of its free institutions.
'"'The sun which set upoi the lifeless corp;
of my late friend anl colleague, rose bright
aid cheeirng tpon his ditant fireside circle
amd the wife of his bosom blessed its glad
smte bteams, andi tol her innocent children
hat it brought the return of their fathier one
day nearer.
".Alas! " nor wvife. nor chiildren shaht see
him~ more.'" Who shall now penetra;te the .
hier'avedl tmlatan, and witnesvs the tear-,
thme agonyi, theI dlistract ion tiCthe widow and -
andl the tttnlweless! Mr i. Presitdent, I caninot.
May lie V,'thletr ohf all miceces be their coim
thur~er and suppiorte.
"Ofi the causie and manner of the death
of Mr U.. I forhare to speak ; but allow my
to say, that it is tmy solen cotivicthi that
lie enteartainedl no ill will, and itntemiledl no -
disresp~et, to Mr. Graves, in any thing thc:n
oetnrred , and that in accepting t i ea!I, he
did niothing tmore thati lie helieved ind..
Jpensable, to avoid disgrace to himself, to his
ittmily, and to his conistituients."'
Anmd tiow titmost tuseful citiz~en, a faither,
a husbantd has b:etn cut off' in thle primte of
his days-and fojr whiat! 'Tete was not
even a difjicualiy between haiself atnd Mr.
Graves. It wias an an'atir proper'ly of an- -
othetr personi. Can Mr. Graves re'joice that
lie lhas killed nt nm, with w hotm there was
no cazuse ofi offensie I Is there any satisfie

W~ebbs' battle for him and congtieredt!
Since wr'ting the above, we find lhv he
Meretnry's C'orrespoilence., thait the er.
citieent piroduCed lby the deathl of Mr. C.
has been in~creased by the dev-elopemenit of
