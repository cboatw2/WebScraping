SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN ADVOCATE.
, S From the Richmond Chrietlan Advocate.
! ' New Orleans, Nov. 25,1844.
Rev. L. M. Lee,—Dear Sir,—I have just
read, in the Christian Advocate and Journal, of
November 6, the protest, from the Rocking
ham district, of the Baltimore Conference. 1 his
is a well written paper, and what is belter, the
feeling of the writers was evidently that which
ought to influence men who setthemselves down
to instruct others, especially in what regards re
ligion. But though I admire the style and love
the spirit of this Protest, I am compelled to dis
sent from the writers in regard to every ground
on which it is placed.
The first ground, on which these writers rest
their Protest, is that “ disastrous consequences
have always attended upon church divisions.”
That more or less evil always is found attendant
on church divisions, that result from difference
in regard to doctrine or polity, will, 1 believe,
be rendered evident from all ecclesiastical history.
But the church division, which is protested
against in this paper, is not of this kind. There
is no purpose among Southern Methodists to
change either the doctrine or discipline, under
which the Methodist Episcopal Church has ever
rallied. The division contemplated is a juris
dictional division,—rendered necessary by the
civil condition #f the South, and the adverse
opinions of the North, East and West on the
subject of slavery. Now at least two divisions
of this kind are recorded in the history of Meth
odism; and it is yet to be learned that any dis
astrous consequences have resulted from either.
I allude to the jurisdictional separation, on politi
cal grounds, of the American, from the British
Methodists; and the same kind of separation of
Canadian from American Methodists. There
is, as appears to me, an exact parallelism in the
separation of Northern and Southern Methodists,
provided for in the adopted report of the Com
mittee of Nine, and these church-divisions which
have been notoriously beneficial rather than in
jurious.
The second ground, upon which this protest
is rested, is that the “ difficulty giving rise to
the controversy is not of sufficient magnitude to
justify division.” On this point I am compelled
to dissent from the protest, both in regard to the
intrinsic character of the difficulty; and as it
creates a necessity for division. It might be
viewed, by slaveholding ministers, as a hardship,
and considered impolitic that, in the exercise of
the right of suffrage, the General Conference
had never thought proper to choose a slavehold
er to the office of Bishop; but it never was
deemed, and 1 am persuaded never would have
been deemed sufficient to justify a division of the
church. For, however practically injurious
and insulting the invidious distinction thus made
among ministers of the same grade in the same
church, might be considered, in the eye of the
Constitution, law and judicial proceedings of
that church, slaveholders enjoyed equal rights
with their non-slavehol ling brethren. But,
when, by a solemn official act, no matter what
was the particular character of the act, the slave
holder was declared to be unequal in rights, to
his brother who was unconnected with slavery,
his position, with relation to the Constitution and
laws of his church, was radically changed ; and
it became impossible that brethren, who ought
to be equal in rights, but were thus declared not
to be so, should dwell together in unity or ope
rate together in harmony.
But besides the influence that this officially
avowed derogation from the rights of slavehold
ing ministers must exert directly upon them, the
people among whom these ministers were called
by Divine Providence to labor, would not receive
the ministrations of a church which was known
to exclude a minister from any of its offices, sim
ply because he was a slaveholder. This asser
tion is made in the face of the whole slavehold
ing community ; .and, if untrue, will doubtliss,
be contradicted, not^by a few individuals here and
there, nor by certain anti slavery districts of
slaveholding States merely, but by the great
body of the Southern Methodist Church, than
whom none have cherished a warmer attachment
to the union, while it could be safely preserved.
I repeat, with fearless assurance, that were
Methodist ministers in the South to submit to any
nffirial net of the General Conference, bv which
their equality with other ministers of that
church was destroyed,—because of their being
slaveholders, their mission would be fruitless,
they would not be received either in or out of the
church, and this fact renders division necessary
after the actions of the General Conferences, in
the cases of Andrew and Harding had determin
ed that holding slaves rendered a minister dis
qualified to hold certain offices to which they
would otherwise be eligible. Intrinsically, then,
as creating a disparity of rights in the same
clas3 of church members; and as throwing in
zuptrable obstacles in the way of Southern min
istrations, the “ difficulty giving rise to the con
troversy is of sufficient magnitude to justify,—
fully justify division.
The General Conference had never “ nega
tived the existence of slavery in the Episcopacy,
nor had the principle of doing so ever been set
tled among us." In the exercise of discretion,
the not doing of a thing does not negative the
doing of it,—much less does it settle the princi
ple that it is not to be done. Has the fact that
the great State of Pennsylvania had never pro
duced a man for the Presidency of the United
States, negatived her right to do so, or settled the
principle that she never shall? Or, if this is
not considered a parallelism, let me ask if the
fact that the non-election of any naval officer of
the United States to the Presidency has negativ
ed the existence of this class of citizens in the
Presidency, or settled the principle that no gen
erous tar shall ever fill that high office 1 That
the principle here supposed to be settled never
was settled before the last General Conference,
is evident from the fact, that no electicn for
Bishop, so far ns I know, was ever held, in
which more or less votes were not given for
slaveholers. Was the principle settled when
the change of a single vote would have elected a
slaveholder to that office 1 If the existence of
slavery in the Episcopacy was negatived, and
the principle of its being so, settled, Bishop
McKendree, in 1824, knew nothing of the mat
ter; for when, in that year, I asked him who
ought to be chosen for Bishops at the approach
ing General Conference, he replied, Joshua
Soule and Thomas L. Douglass, the latter of
whom was a slaveholder. Surely a moment’s
reflection must convince the sober-minded, sen
sible writers of the Rockingham Protest that
the non-election of slaveholders to the office of
Bishop did not negative^he existence of slavery
in the Episcopacy, nor settle any principle
against it. But, the action of the late General
Conference, in the case of Bishop Andrew, did
both ; nnd in doing them, it declared slavehold- i
j ing ministers unequal in rights to their nou
slaveholding brethren, thereby furnishing a jus- j
lification and creating a necessity for division. I
I This Protest rests thirdly, upon “ the restric
tions division must necessarily place upon our
ministry.’’ And what are those restrictions?
One would think from the tenor of this Protest,
that, should the contemplated division take place,
a minister one side of the line of demarcation
would not be allowed to preach the gospel on
the other side of that line. Most assuredly,
however, the adopted report, of the Committee
of Nine, is innocent of any such restriction as
this. On the contrary, that report proceeds,
evidently, on the supposition that a fraternal com
munication will exist ; and, that, though divided
in ecclesiastical jurisdiction, the parties will
love ns brethren, and interchange services as
different households of the same great family of
Methodism. The relative position in which the
contemplated division would place the parties,
would not be precisely that in which two An
nual Conferences, of the Methodist Episcopal
Church, are found in relation to each other,—In
the former, the lines of ecclesiastical jurisdic
tion are permanent, in the latter they may be
changed every four years, without the consent
! ol the parties being directly and specifically
given ; and, in the meantime, the Bishop may
[transfer from one jurisdiction to the other with*
: out consulting either the preacher to be trans
| furred, or either of the conferences concerned in
the transfer. While however, a preacher of any
grade, is under the jurisdiction of any Annual
Conference, say Baltimore, he cannot exercise
ecclesiastical authority within the boundaries of
another Annual Conference, say Virginia : Yet,
what Methodist preacher ever imugined that1
such a limitation of his ecclesiastical jurisdiction
placed a restriction upon his ministerial rights or
obligations? But admitting that there is nota
sufficient parallelism between these cases to rea
son from one to the other, it surely cannot be de
nied that such a parallelism dois exist between
the division provided for in the action of the late
General Conference and that which Mr. Wesley
himself advised in the case of British and
American Methodists, and in that which was ef
fected in the case of American and Canadian
Methodists. And, yet, it has never been under
stood, I believe, that either British, American or
Canadian Methodist ministers considered their
ministerial functions subjected to any anti-evan
gelical restrictions, by those divisions which con
fine their ecclesiastical jurisdiction to the limits
prescribed to the Wesleynns, the Methodist E.
Church and the Canada Conference respectively.
In the case of each of theso divisions of the
Methodist body, political circumstances over
which the church could exercise no control, ren
dered a perpetuity of the union inexpedient, if
not impracticable ; and indicated the lute of de
marcation between the parties separating. This
is precisely the character of the question now be
fore the church ; and should the division con
templated take place, the parlies will be in exact
ly the same relative position, as that of the Wes
leyans and the Methodist Episcopal Church, or
that of the Methodist E. Church and the Can
ada Conference.
1 was, I confesss, not a little surprised to see
writers, so sober minded and reasonable as the
Rockingham Protesters, distressed by the per
suasion that a jurisdictional separation of the
Methodist E. Chuich, would bo incongruous to
the doctrine of possible salvation to all men, for
this is, I presume, what they mean by universal
salvation. There is an air of sincerity, through
out this whole document, which forbids the sup
position that there was any intention to juggle;
and, yet, how an agreement between two branch
es of the same Methodist family, to confine their
ecclesiastical jurisdiction within limits mutually
agreed to, should be thought incongruous to the
doctrine of grace through Christ Jree to all,
passes, my ingenuity to conceive ! Surely the
Presiding' Elder of the Rockingham District
does not suppose that his doctrine and practice
are antagonistic, because he is restrained from
exercising ecclesiastical jurisdiction, for four
long years, within the East Baltimore district I
Nor, 1 presume, does Bishop Hcdding consider
his practice antagonistic to the doctrine of possi
ble universal salvation, because he has no eccle
siastical jurisdiction in Great Britain or Can
ada.
That Abolitionists should object 10 any agiee
ment with Southern Methodists with regard to
the limits of ecclesiastical jurisdiction, is natural
enough, they believing, us they affirm they do,
that all sluveholding is sinful. In their view,
no slaveholding minister can preach u pure gos
pel; and, consequently, the w hole terriiory un
der such a ministry must be considered by them
as missionary ground. But Abolitionists, and
with good reason loo, on their own principles,
deprecate the continuance of union with slave
holders, even more than jurisdictional division.
Their principles require a cessation of Christian
communion with slaveholders as sinners. But,
upon what principle those who admit the Chris
tian character of slaveholding ministers, should
deem it necessary to universality of ministerial
commission, that non-slaveholding ministers
should exercise ecclesiastical authoiity on the
terriiory assigned to such slaveholding ministers,
1 am not able to conjecture. At any rate, 1 can
see no greater restriction upon their ministerial
functions in this case, than in their being pre-1
eluded the exercise of ecclesiastical authority in !
Canada. |
With regard to missionary operations, there isl
still less ground for the Protest than is found on :
the subject of ordinary ecclesiastical economy. '
Missionary ground is considered, and properly
considered, common ground which, till appro
priated by some Christian sect, is equally open to
the occupancy of any sect. The churchman,
the Presbyterian, the Baptist, the Wesleyan, the
Episcopal and Canada Methodists may all meet
in Africa, in China, among the Indians,or in the
Islands, and find ample room to carry on their
common enterprize after their peculiar method . |
nor can I see what hindrafice a jurisdictional ■
division of the Methodist E. Church, would!
throw in the way of missionary operations. On
the contrary, I am-very certain that such a divi
sion is indispensable to the success of some ol
our most interesting missionary operations.
Should Liberia fall under the organization ex
pected to be established in the South, will Sevs
necessarily forsake the mission there? I know
not; but I suppose that be will not deem his mis
sionary vocation recalled by the fact, that he is
under an organization which has sufficient con
sistency not to exclude men from the Episcopacy,
for a cause which docs not prevent membership
or attainment to the highest grade of ministerial
Order. I apprehend that missionary zeal would
not allow a pause, even in the mind of any one,
unless he were an honest abolitionist, upon the
question ofjurisdiction whether North or South.
Stevens, I presume, would not go to Texas, if un
der the jurisdiction of an organization admitting
of slavery in the Episcopacy: for he, I believe,
is an abolitionist, but Summers, I am sure,
though the advocate of Southern rights, would
not be baulked in a missionary enterprise, to
which he felt himself called by Divine Provi
dence, though that mission were under the juris
diction of an anti-Southern organization. My
own conviction is, that, so far Irotn a necessary
hindrance to Missionary enterprize, the division,
provided for by the late General Conference, may
greatly extend and promote that enterprize.
This protest is grounded, fourthly, on “the
uraystv** »uumi«w iuo v»»'i unit j/uuu
cal relations of our country,” which the contem
plated division of the Church assumes.”—If
there be threatening aspects to the civil and poli
tical relations of our Country at all assumed by
the contemplated division of the Church, those
aspects are presented alone by the influence
which abolitionist agilaticMns exerted in bring
ing about that division. Neither at the Noith
or the South would the civil or polifltal relations
of our country be in the slightest degree affected
by uny movement in our Church purely ecclesi
astical. What, then, is likely to be the political
and civil bearing of division in the Church on
account of the existing difficulty ?—Will it have j
a tendency to alarm the South in regard to her
peculiar institutions, to see 400,000 Methodists j
renounce the union of the Church, rather than ■
submit to degradation on account of connection j
with those Institutional I should not suppose it
would. Or, can it be supposed that the South will
give up the political and civil relations of our
country out of resentment for the injuries which
have driven those 400,000 Methodists from the
union of the Church 1 Those injuries, had they
been tamely submitted by those upon whom they
were inflicted, might have induced political ac
tion in the South : but the determination of South
ern Methodists not to submit to the attempted de
gradation will render all political inteiference
nnd anxiety unnecessary. In the North, the ef
fect will be still more favorable. Abolition agi
tation relies mainly upon the religious bearing
of the question ; and, the most effective argument
which can be employed is derived from the ec
clesiastical connection existing between slave
holders and anti-slavery men. Destroy this con
nection ; and tho’ agitation may not wholly cease,
its greatest efficiency will be gone. If, as I sin
j cerely hope will soon be the case, all the leading
J Churches should peaceably divide on this ques
tion, the efficiency, if not the occupation of Abo
| litionists will, I atn persuaded, be at an end. Arid,
then, so far as slavery is concerned, the civil and
political relations of our country will have noth
ing to fear.
The fifth ground of the Rockingham Protest,
is that the present is “of all others, the most un
favorable, “period” for the toleration of Church
divisions." There never can be a more or a less
favorable time for Church divisions, without suf
ficient cause—such division is always and only
evil. But, whenever division becomes proper,
the sooner it takes place the better for all parties
affected by it. Such a state of things now exists
in the Methodist E. Church as renders division
both proper and necessary ; and, therefore, this is
the most favorable time for it to take place that
will ever be known. No question can exist with
regard to the justness of the above conclusion
provided the fact assumed be admitted. The
lact, then, is all with which we are at present con
cerned. It will not I suppose, be denied, by any
advocate of the continuance of Church union,
that there is a settled purpose on the part of the
anti-slavery portion of the Church, to insist on
the point made in the late General Conference—
that slave-holding, in any circumstances,operates
a disqualification to hold the Episcopal office.
Now, though the South would have submitted,
indefinitely to the exclusion of her ministers from
this office, by the exercise of the elective discre
tion of a majority, they cannot submit to an offi
cial declaration of their incapacity for that office,
without degradation in rank, as well as in their
own eyes: hence, were the union of the Church
continued, it would involve a perpetual conflict
j of the parties, utterly inconsistent with the spirit
| and the purposes of Church union. Besides,
i suunnssiuu iu ima ui-jjiauuuuu uuuiu jncvtm me
! access of Southern Ministers to the people of
I their charge, and thus destroy the success of their
[ ministry. The evils, therefore, of perpetuating
ecclesiastical union, with such an unbeatable
schism in the body, would be incomparably great
er than any that could result from jurisdictional
division. And, this being the case, the division
! cannot be too soon effected. The evils of divis
ions, so vividly and eloquently depicted by the
protest, are mere phantasmata, generated in the
| poetic imaginations of the writers of that protest.
Have similar calamities followed upon any stmt
far division of the Church ? On that of Ameri
can from British Methodism ? Or, on that of
Canada from the Methodist E. Church ? The
South in this division do not intend taking a hos
tile attitude in relation to the brethren from whom
they separate—on the contrary, if permitted, we
shall gladly move, side by side, with them in the
great work of spreading Scriptural holiness over
the earth. Nor, have we any reason to believe
that from this kindly and chistian attitude there
will be any disposition on their part to remove
us.
The sixth ground of the Rockingham Protest
against a division in the Methodist E. Church, is
that the protestors “think that by proper time,
and the use of proper means such a compromise
may be effected as will harmonize the views of
the Church, North and South, and preserve en
tire our peace and union.” Were this opinion
of the Rockingham Protest, well founded, this
ground of protest would be tenable; and every
true friend of Methodism would be disposed to
await the proper lime and use the proper means
to secure so desirable aresult. But. in my view,
the very best that can be said of this opinion is
that it is wholly gratuitous. Nay, to call it sim
ply gratuitous is doing it much more than jus
tice. It is against all probability. Do these
brethren hope that Northern, or anti-slavery bre
thren will retract the official expression of their
sense that connection with slave-holding operates
a disability to hold the office of Bishop 1 Or, do
they imagine that Southern Methodists will re
main in ecclesiastical connection with a Church
in which their ministers are subjected to this dis
ability 1 Either supposition seems to me violent
ly improbable; and upon what possible ground,
without the concession of one or the other of
these opposite points, the parties can be harmoni
zed and the peace and union of the Church pre
served, I confess I have not ingenuity enough
even to conjecture.
1 have now calmly and with sober argument
reviewed the whole of the Rockingham Protest;
and the result, to my perfect conviction, is that
that Protest is not sustained by one single tena
ble position. Take away the excellence of its
style and spirit—view it simply ns an argument
against division, and I apprehend, every impar
tial reader will perceive that it utterly fails to
show that it is either wrong in principle or ex
pedient for the Church, in existing circumstan
ces, peaceably and by mutual consent, to divide,
and establish two independent bodies, animated
by the same Itinerant spirit, guided by the same
evangelical teaching, and trained by the same
Scriptural Discipline—one in doctrine, spirit, ob
ject and Discipline, though separate and inde
pendent in jurisdiction, and merely expedient
economy. William Winans.
THE DEVIL’S CASTAWAYS.
The following anecdote of Whitefield was
communicated by the Countess of Huntingdon
to the Barry, R. A.; and sent by him to me. I
give it in his own words:—“Some persons called
one Saturday morning, to pay a visit to Lady
Huntingdon, and, during the visit, her ladyship
inquired of them if they had ever heard Mr.
Whitefield preach? Upon being answered in
the negative, she said, • I wish you would hear
him, he is to preach to-morrow evening,’ at such
a church or chapel, the name of which the writer
forgets, nor is it material;—they promised her
ladyship they would certainly attend. They were
as good as their word ; and, uptjj calling on the
Monday morning on her ladyship, she anxiou^y
inquired if they had heard Mr. Whitefield on the
previous evening, and how they liked him?—
‘O my lady, of all the preachers we ever heard,
he is the moststrangeund unaccountable. Among
other preposterous things, [would your ladyship
believe it,] he declared that Jesus Christ tvas so
willing to receive sinners, that he did not object
to receive even the devil’s castaways. Now, my
lady, did you ever hear of such a thing since you
was born!’ To which her ladyship made the
following reply:—‘There is something, 1 ac
knowledge, a little singular in the invitation, and
I do not recollect to have ever met with it before:
but as Mr. Whitefield is now below in the parlor
we will have him up, and let him answer for
himself.’ Upon his coming up into the drawing
room, Lady Huntingdon said, ‘ Mr. Whitefield,
these ladies have been preferring a heavy charge
against you, and I thought it best that you should
come up and defend yourself:—they say, that, in
your sermon last evening, in speaking of the
willingness of Christ to receive sinners, you cx
press(d yourself in the following terms:—that so
willing was Chri t to receive sinners, that he
was ready to receive even thcdevil’scastawnys!’
—Mr. Whitefield immediately replied, 11 cer
tainly, my lady, must plead guilty to the charge:
whether 1 did what was right or otherwise, your
ladyship shull judge Horn the following circum
stance.—Did your ladyship notice, about half an
hour ago, a very modest, single rap at the door ?
It was given by a poor, miserable-looking, aged
female, who requested to speak with me.—I de
sired her to be shown into the parlor, when she
accosted me in the following manner:—11 be
lieve, sir, you preached last evening, at such a
chapel.’—‘Yes, I did.’—‘Ah, sir I I was acci
dentally passing the door of that chapel, and
hearing the voice of some one preaching, I did
what I never have been in the habit of doing, I
went in:—and one of the first things I heard you
say, was, that Christ was s'o willing to receive
sinners, that he did not object to receiving the
devil’s castaways. Now, sir, I have been on the
i town for many years, and am so worn out in his
! service, that I think I may with truth be called
! one of the devil’s castaways!—Do you think, sir,
j that Jesus Christ would receive me?’—Mr.
Whitefield assured her that there was not a doubt
; of it, if she was but willing to go to him. From
the sequel it appeared that it was the case, and
that it ended in the sound conversion of this poor
I creature; and Lady Huntingdon was assured,
from the most respectable authority that the wo
man left a very charming testimony behind her,
that though her sins had been of a crimson hue,
the atoning blood of Christ had washed them
white as snow.”—Philips' Life and Times oj

THE GRAVE.
“ Loaves have their time to fall,
And flowers to wither at the North wind’s breath;
And stars to set—but all—
Thou hast all seasons for thine own, oh Death !”
Who hath not thought of the dark and gloomy
abodes of the dead—the sepulchre—alike of the
proud king and the humble cottager, along
whose brow the care and labor of years ha»c
scattered many a furrow; and whose only
hope in the toil and turmoil of “ life’s bleak
waste," is the blessed assurance, perchance,
of a happy immortality! There is something
in the weary precincts of the “ narrow house,’
where all lie undistinguished together—lh<
mighty and the noble, in state, magnificent ir
| their ruin, and the one above whose mouldering
form no storied monument or sculptured marble
teN how he ended his existence—there is some
thjng, I say, in all this, which should bow the
mighty to the earth, and cause the bumble slave
to walk with a proud heart and kindling eye by
fore his superior.
This is a common-place theme—but the mind
of man reverts often to it against his will. There
is nought which gives such a blunt to the distinc
tions—ol earth—which by reflection will subdue
every cause of envy, as this simple but ill-impor
tant theme. Look at the mighty old—the phil
osophers and statesmen of years long gone by.
Where are they? How many are forgotten?
Their deeds are slumbering in the lap of oblivion ;
the wave of time hath swept even their histori
ans into the boundless sea of Eternity—the
fallen wall conceals their sepulchres in the lone
ly aisles of their forefathers—and the night-wind
sighs among the ruins' where once the song of
joy and the burst of gladness stole forth from the
heart of glee; and the lustre of many an eye is
shrouded in the deep Grave’s night, which kin
dled with love, and looked abroad upon the var
ied scenes of Nature with admiration and delight.
Alas! the pride of man goes down with him
into the dust! it withers when the lamp of his
transient existence flickers out into the long
slumbering of the tomb. Where are they who
sounded the clarion of war along the plains of
Thessaly, the mount of Marathon, and “ Samos’s
rocky isle?” The trumpet's voice has died
upon the breeze—the thousands which it aroused
have gone to rest—the castles which have been
subdued and won, on whose walls the spear
glittered and the cannon pealed, have crumbled
into dust—the ivy lingers about the decaying
turrets—the raven builds her nest in the case
ments, and sends upon the ear of midnight her
desolate wailings—the owl hoots where the
song was heard—and man, proud man, who
once fought and won—him who reared the
structure, '
"Sleeps where all must sleep.”
His memory is not in the bosom of the guide
who conducts the traveller among the shadowy
magnificence of other ages, and he is forgottenl
Should not these things, the mutability of earthly
grandeur, pour into the soul deep and lasting
preparations for that great last change, when a
long and dreamless slumber falleth upon man?
When the nauseous earth-wonn preys alike
upon the hero and the cottager, in the narrow
bourne where
“ All life’s idle throbbings cease,
| And pain is lulled to rest.”

For tho Southern Christian Advocate.
ABSTRACT REASONING, THE SOURCE
OI' ERROR—RIGHT TO DIVIDE THE
CHURCH.
Sound philosophy, no less than Christian
charity, constrains us to attribute very many of
the oppressive measures that distress the world
to an inadequate conception of tiuth and righte
ousness, rather to any settled hostility to them.
Observation unites with revelation in testimony,
that happiness is themorccertainly secured by the
practice of righteousness: and the Jaws of the
land are the index tn the world’s opinions on this
subject. The mind, by native instinct, .seeks
after truth on the one hand, and to avoid error
on the other: and subsequent experience con
firms and nurtures this native principle, show
ing that error in theory necessarily results dis
astrously in practice. The tnind will believe
something : and no man embraces error for er
ror’s sake: nor does it ever become a part of
his faith, or the rule of his life, until it wears the
semblance of truth, or reason be stifled, and
conscience crushed beneath the pressure of pre
judice or passion. The same is true of the
practice of righteousness almost universally, for
few are found so utterly abandoned as to be un
just because they love fraud. We are not in
formed that Gaalam delighted in cursing; but
he “ loved the wages." Judas hanged himself
for the crime, but he had a passion for gain.
These propositions are axiomatic when applied
to Christians; for they, “ being partaker of the
divine nature, through the exceeding great and
precious promises, have escaped the corruptions
that are in the world through lust, and are ever
following that which is good ,” and action would
always be the exact exponent of truth and
righteousness in the soul, if the mind could as
adequately grasp the one, as the heart love the
other. But such is the imbecility of the holiest
men, that the utmost effort of mind often fails to
perceive “ What is fact and fiction what;” the
semblance is mistaken for the substance, and
this, like the devil dressed in angel’s garb, mars
the plan, and works ill where only good was in
tended. But are not the “Scriptures able to
make us wise,” “ that the man of God may be
perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good
works?" To this, I reply, “ we understand in
part," and although the intention be never so
guilt or innocence) yet 1 doubt not that for
want of sense we spoil the proportions of the
“ faith delivered to the saints,” and make the
Bible itself often subserve the cause of error.
While, therefore, this single cause is the fruit
ful source of evil, even with the good, the
thoughtful, and the wise, we need not be sur
prised that the million, who, often driven on by
passion, seize upon their object without re
flection, should fall into divers contentions and
offences by the way. In the present organiza
tion of society, no principle is ever found occu
pying an isolated position. Nay; in the whole
order of God’s grace and providence as far at
revealed to us, every act is performed in refer
ence to the great whole. He who made man e
social being, also ordained his social relations
and while the corresponding duties are all mad<
to harmonize in the great end, the glory of God
yet, in the performance of them, they act as mu
tual checks or qualifications of each other. S(
that any abstract, isolated principle, laid dowa
as a rule of life, or made the sole basis of an ar
gument, leads—must lead, to an ultra conclusion,
does not harmonize in the concrete mass, and is,
therefore, utterly at war with the g°°d it pro
posed to effect. To illustrate. A political econ
omist takes the unqualified principle of free
trade, the result is the paralysis of home indus
try, and a system of direct taxation to support
the government Take its opposite, Protection,
the effect is the exclusion of all imports and
prostration of commerce. The man of prayer
stays on his knees to the detriment of practical
piety, or the “diligent in business” runs his
team* to death, and wears himself out, to keep
up with them, leaving his prayers unsaid,—the
missionary to starve, and the Heathen to die
without the gospel. The abolitionist sticks to
his principle. “ It is wrong to enslave a man
forgets all qualifications of necessity or mercjr,
and soon puts down slaveholding as the “sum
of all villanies;” or the pro-slavery man, mis*
taking the divine recognition of the fact, for
the appointment of the institution, forgets “ if
thou mayest be made free use it the rather,"
and writes the abolitionist a priest of Moloch.—
One man seeing that worldly concerns and
worldly men, war against his heavenly-minded*
ness, cries, “ come out from among them, and
be separate," and straightway runs into austerity
and asceticism. Another says, “ be courteous,"
be “ all things to all menand he becomes
more like a dancing master than a Christian.
Now, in all this, it is manifest, that the place
of truth and righteousness is on some middle
ground, whereall these principles meet and har
monize ; each, maintaining its proper propor
tions and relative importance. Nay: 1 know
| not where abstract principles may be found at
| all, except in the brain of the mere speculatist;
for even in the character of Deity, they are
all found in concrete form, richly blended to
gether, and mellowed into one luminous body
of superlative loveliness, whose name is “ love,
and the Bible, the mighty speculum which
shadows it forth to man : thus, while you must
“ pray without ceasing," yet be “ zealous of
good works." “Diligent in business,” “yet
“ lay not up treasures upon earth.” Provide
for your household, but be “ ready to distribute,”
and so on r.f every practical principle entering
into social life. What, therefore, He hath joined
together let us not separate; so shall we fill up
in our measure a miniature picture of the foun
tain of all good. And so once did our world,
but the spoiler came: and one drop of gall from
the cup of bitterness neutralized the bond of
union. “ Confusion worse confounded,” by con
flicting interests, discordant passions and im
becility of mind, has been the melancholy re

| office of mind directed by the spirit of religion,

truth, as to ameliorate the ills, and mitigate the
i evils it may not remedy. And the having done
so,—the witness by whose testimony the right
eous shall be separated from the wicked before

while the sincere seeker of truth finds much in
these remarks to create distrust of his own opin
ions, to soften the spirit of dogmatism, to smooth
the asperities of bigotry, and to fling wide the

| vigorous investigation, and his hand to manly
I effort in execution of the good his heart con
I ceives. Hence, while the friends of our Zion
have not failed to perceive that the elements en
tering into the psesent movements of our Church
are pregnant with much of good or ill; it is not
strange that our presses have teemed with
hopes, and fears, and plans, and arguments, and
opinions. Nor was it novel that these were dis
similar, conflicting. Sometimes, indeed, there
were hints at “ convenience of memory,” and
“ misstatement of facts,” which certainly did
sound strange, and are deeply to be regretted.
: But in the regular course of argument, many
| things are said, which, to my mind, seem erro
| neous. It would be too tedious, as well as per
haps profitless, to attempt here a refutation of
them all; but there is one principle held by some,
intimately associated with the present great
movement of our host into two separate bodies,
which, from its importance and position, claims
investigation. It is broadly asserted, and assert
ed with emphasis, too, that “ there is no right,
natural or constitutional,—no right,any where,
to divide the Church.” Now the thing proposed
to be done is, to unbind the ties which hare
hitherto held the slaveholding and non-slare
holding conferences together, under one eccle
siastical organization. This, then, is the sense
in which the phrase “ divide the Church” is
used, otherwise the argument is irrelevant. It
would not be hard to show that in the present
organization, there is no constitutional right vest
ed any where, conferring the authority to make
a disruption in the Church, by forcibly excom
municating any member, or body of members,
who had violated no rule of faith or practice
taught in the Book of Discipline. But it might
be more difficult to prove, that a compact volun
tarily entered into may not of right be dissolved
by the mutual consent of the contracting parties.
And. I doubt not, it would be a fruitless search
to find a Methodist, North or South, who wishes
violently to detain either the person or proj^rty
of any man, against whom he has no claim, after
he has signified his desire for separation. I
have yet to learn that the Methodist Church is
either a prison-house or a den of thieves. But
the term “ right is used in various senses, viz:
power, authority, prerogative, propriety, or fit
ness, and equity. Now, admitting all this legiti
mate ; yet to use the word thus indiscriminately'
in the same article, certainly gives an equivocal
ness to the writer’s meaning, which does little to
remove the “ vagueness” of our “ idea, that there
is a power lodged somewhere to divide the
Church." Let us state the proposition thus:
The General Conference, (as so many members
of the Church) evidently had the power and the
natural right to agree (for themselves) to dissolve
their connection, and to recommend the same
course to others. As the Conference it bad the
authority under the constitution to propose an
alteration in the “ restrictive articles,” and to ask
the concurrence of the Annual Conferences, and
it is the unquestionable prerogative of these
bodies to control the “ Book Concern, and the
“ Chartered Fund,” and under the contemplated
alteration of the restrictive articles, their agents
will have the authority to apportion this pro
perty ; and it obviously comports with propriety
- bf action, that they divide equitably between the
two parties. Thus defined, it does seem to me,
that when our natural rights, as men, our civil
rights, as citizens, our disciplinary rights, as
Methodists, and our scriptural, equitable rights
as Christians, are all brought together forming
concrete claims and privileges. We have aU
right to form two churches of the materials
formerly held together under one jurisdiction. I
use the term churches in the sense of our Con
stitution (Art 13.) If it still be objected that
the movement is not a constitutional one, it will
be sufficiently answered by saying that the
movement superinducing it, and sought to be
avoided, is uot a seastitutienal oaa But suppose
