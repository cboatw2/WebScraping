This, however is not the. most serious
accusatioo. It is further in proof that
these Senators, when a biil amending the
charter of the Hartem Bail Road, was
before (he Senate for a third reading, formed
a conspiracy with Bartow and others,
to delay its passage until stock could be
purchased at reduced prices. That in
pursuance of that conspiracy, they each
on successive days, made speeches against
this hdk which delayed its passage until
Bartow had purchased the stock, and that
thef then balk roltd for the bill! " _ <
It is further in proof that -Kemble,
since the commencement of the present i
session, toW a Director of the Coroftier-1
cial Bank, that if the Bauk would exoner- \
ate him from bis liabilities and the char- ]
ges in relation to the affair, he wouldgucr- ^

' We have received from Washington tho melancholy
intelligence offho death of Col. Manning,
the representative from this District. Tho
tribute of respect to his memory, by Col. Preston 31
in the Senate, and Mr. Pinckncy in the House, 6]
though deserved, is the more honorable to these W
gentlemen from their having been politically T
opposed to him. ' ' ai

Extract of a letter from Washington City to a c<
gentleman in this place dated May 3d, 1836. 111
" Your very estimable and much regretted Rep- .
rcscntative, Col. Manning, left us last Thursday
in health and on on excursion to Philadelphia.
On Sunday he dined in company, was nnusually
cheerful, left the table at lutff past four, and was
taken with a dullness and a disposition to vomit,
and in an hour without almost any pain or effort
was a corpse. His death was supposed to have
been caused by soroo enlargement of the blood
vessels, about the heart."

their passions by one-sided, or exaggerated state- 1 of

and to "republican institutions that the country |
should be kept in almost constant commotion J
upon the question. Who shall be our rulers ? I cil
Sorely, if the people are qualified for self govern- fir<
mcnt, this ? not'nccessary. If the conductors J*<
of the public press were men who would give tho ^
unvarnished truth, and nothing but the truth to
their readers, the people would" bo much belter th
qualified than they now are for the discharge of ^
their political duties, and tho country would in ^
every respect be much better off. There k
nothing in whiclrreform is so much needed as in
this particular. We have sometimes thought that wi
it would be art advantage to the country if each tb
State should Establish a newspaper, and appoint ^
Editors, to bo paid fixed salaries from the State ^
treasury, who should bo sworn to insert in their
columns the truth,' the whole truth, and nothing , tb

the puMic lands, it will be seen, by a reference to '
the proceedings of Congress, has finally passed
tho Senate by & majority of 5 votes. If it should
pass the other House, it is prob&blo the President
will again veto it, as he did last year In
that case, it will, at last be lost. For the majority
in its favor in the Senate is less than two thirds,
and it is not probable that any of the PreBidcnt'6
