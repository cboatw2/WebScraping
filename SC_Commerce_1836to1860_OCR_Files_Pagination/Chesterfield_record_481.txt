question
Mr. Johnron deprecated the disposition,
which ho ssiid was manifested, on the part
et his Southern friends, to excite alarm anmng
tlieir constituents on tne subject of
i the Tanlf. He alluded to the speeches of
i Mr. Wise, Mr. liluck, and Mr. Alford.
There \%as no foundation for these jealou.
nesaiid alarms, for the Northern members
j had avowed their intention to adhere to
the Compromise. There seemed to he an
: anxious desire on- the part of Southern j
; j lie til hers, to fan the flames of sectional
discord, and to rake up the old expiring
! embers of party strife; for the cry of

fucc of the disclaimers positively made hv
! Mr. Cashing nnd others of any wish tare-1
vivo the protective tariff.
! Mr. A!ford, of (Ja. hej/jred leave to ex1
plain. These disclaimers laid not been
| made here until after the Southern men
? had protested against a protective tariff,
i In his own remarks, he had commented
i ??n the declaration of Mr. Barnard, of Now
York, that the North was entitled tosom*j
protect ton.
Mr. Johnson thought, he said, that Mr.
j t 'ashing had given his views before Alj
ford spoke.
Mr. Cashing stated that this was said,
' bo', while up, he would heg leave to ex.
ihiin wh.it he meant in usimr the term
' I"*** ? ?
. compromise. lie had not alluded to any
; specific act or compact on the subject of
the Tariff nor had he stated what ought
, to he the construction of the compromise
, act. What he said was that the peopta of
; Mass., he believed, were in favor of the
i principle and policy of compromise, and
averse to an extravagant protective tariff.
S >1110 of the southern gentlemen laugh,
ed at this explanation, and appeared to
. consider it asjustifying Mr. AI ford's views.
Mr. Johnson, then asked Mr. Cashing
whether he intended this explanation as a
qualification of what lie had before stated.

i with the B:iiisl M nXt< ri.a relation to the
i burning of the steamboat Caroline, anrl
the demand mn 1;: for the liberation of Mr.
1 Alexander 3KI<C0'S respectfully report:
I It appears thn* !:? rfiumbont "Caroline"
was seized and destroyed in the
' month of December, 1607. TiiC committee
are induced to believe that the
facts of the case are as follows: The boat
was owned by, and in possession of, a
; citizen of New York. She was cleared
from the citvof Buffalo, and, on the morn.
ling of the 29th of 1) comber, 18137, she
j left the |>?>rt of Bulfilo, Ixmnd for Schlosi
ser, upon the American side of the Niagara
river, and within the territory of the
i l-nited Slates. The original intention
I ?
seemed to he to run the bout between Bnf!
falo and Schlosser, or perhaps from Black
j Rock dam to Schlosser, and, should it
j seem protilablo, it was intended to run
i her also to Navy Island, ami touch at
i Grand Island and Tonawandu. Herown|
er was .Mr. Wells, said to be a respectable
I citizen of Buffalo, and it is obvious his
intention in putting up the boat was
i one of speculation and profit entirely.?
i The excitement upon that portion of the
| frontier, at litis period, had collected a
; great many in the neighborhood, some
I from curiosity, some from idleness, and
! jthers from taking an interest in the tin.
; usual and extraordinary collection of adI
venturous men gathered together at that
I time on Nuvv Island. Navv Island was
i "nominally in the British "territory."

tngc of circumstances to make sonic moi

j ncy with his boat, by running her as a
j terry boat over to Navy Island. All these
appear from testimony regularly taken,
i (sec II. II. Doc. No. 3)2, pages 40 and
j 00, 2 1 Session, 25th Congress,) and the
committee know of no legal evidence to
contradict them. There is no proof that
any arms or munitions of war were carried
in the boat, exeep', perhaps, one small
six-pounder field piece belonging to a
j passenger. The principal object was to
j run the boat as a ferry boat from Schlos.
! scr, on the American side, to Navy Is.
j iand, on the Hrisish side. 'It is believed

'onn territory, and which recommends
ps If to ns, full as much from its assumption
its from its love of right or law.
The British Minister is pleasealso,
to cull the C.iro'inc a "piratical oleum,
boat.*' The loos; epithets of any one, no
! matter how high in place, cannot make
| that piracy which the law of nations
do?3 not recognise as such. Pirates arc
freebooters, enemies of the human race;
and eminent jurists doscrihe them as rav\
aging cverv sea and coas% with no flag
| a n> ? 7 z*
; and no home. Piracy conies under the
j concurrent jurisdiction of all nations.?
' i Even in the worst point of view that it
' j can he considered, those connected with
! the steamboat Caroline were aiders and
.1 alicttors of others engaged in rebellion.?
j R R
j And t!ie committee are totally at a loss to
know upon what authority rebellion is recognised
us piracy. Such confounding of
terms is resting the case upon opiihel>, in1
: stead of sound law or facts. But even sup1
j poking it to be a ' piratical boat," as the
1 J/iilister asserts it to be,yet the moment
j ii touched our soil it fall under our snvorj
cihriJty, and no power en earth t:o xlrl right I

I that the vessel was "piratical." and the
j citizens murdered were outlaws?then
there is not an Englishman whose heart
would not beat high to avenge the wrong,
and vindicate the rights of his country.?
Tho law there is the law here. And there
is no international law consistent with
! the separate independence oi i?.atior?s, that
| sanctions the pursuit of even pinJns to
; to murder and arson ovee tho soil and
jurisdiction of one of the Statos of this
Confederacy. No greater wrong can he
| done to a country than invasion of soil.?'
If it can he done with impunity at one
' point, and on one occasion, it can be done
; at another, and the nation that submits
I
i to it finally sinks down into drivelling imbecility.
If a representation of the
state of things at Sclosser, and the con!
duet of those who had control of the
Caroline, had first been inside to the pro1
per authorities of New York, or of the

j some show at least of respect for our sov!
ereigntv and independence, and a dispo.
sition to treat us as an equal. But in this
case, as if to treat our authorities with
contempt, there was no preliminary do.
mand or representation made.
It was hoped that the outrage was
perpetrated by a party in sudden heat and
excitement, upon their own responsibility.
Hut the British 3/lnister now avows Ibat
4 the act was the public act of persons
obeying the constitnted authorities of Iter
Majesty's Province," and again affirms
that "it was a public act of persons in her
I Majesty's service, obeying the orders of
their superior authorities."
If this had been the first and only point
of collision with Great Britain, it might
not have excited such interest; but there
' is an assumption in most of our intercourse
' with that great Power, revolting to the
pride and spirit of independence in a free
1 people. If it be her desire to preserve
peace her true policy would be to do jus.
. tice, and show that courtesy to equals

* t
; Treaty stipulations frequently include :
| some articles, and exclude others recognised
irr lac law of nations. Trading in 1
contraband articles is no excuse for inva- j
idiog the territory and soil of a neutral ;
and independent Power, whose private
citizens may choose to run the hazards of
such a trade. In this instance there were j
no two foreign Power* engaged in war;
but all concerned in the outbreak or ex- i
icitcraent within the British jurisdiction
claimed to be British subjects, in resist,
j anceof the authorities of Canada, a pro- j
i vince of the British empire. Even ad- i
mitting, then, that the Caroline was en.
i 'gaged ill contraband trade, yet it was
with citizens who claimed to he subjects
: of the name empire with those who were
styled fbc legitimate officers of llie Pro.
vince. Abstractly speaking, how was a
private citizen to decide who wore right
and w ho wrong in these local disputes?
And which portion of citizens of the same
province must our citizens refuse to have
I anv communication with? But the fx>at
/ %
j was merely used for oive day as a terry
; boat, and on the night of the day she commenced
running she was seized, while
moored at the wharfSchlosscr,and burnt.
| Several men were assassinated; certainly
i one who fell dead upon the dock. Now,

demand made hy tiie British 3/mister for
the 'liberation" of A foamier AftLcotf,
the committee believe the facts of tirt? case
to he, that the steamboat was seized' a'rwl- \'sl
