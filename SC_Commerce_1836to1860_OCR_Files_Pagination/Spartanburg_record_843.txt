THE JOBBER'S CLERK.
BY JAMBS DIXON.
I ' Charles Emlen WU clerk in a Dry Goods jobbI
ing house in Cedar* street; young, ambitious, and
of. a good family, his expectation* of outOrinz ear
<< ly into business on hie own account, were flattering,
and not without the youthful hope of.beiug ,
* ' prosperous. " / ' ,v . . ? 4 . -V ;,
I, ' Having recoived a liberal education, and the ;
f v ?g| ground-Work of to mercantile career as thoroughly ti
I engrafted into his mind as theory Would permit; 1
his father placed him in the store of an old aud n
experienced merchant and ^valued friend. In the
I course of two or thrco years, Charles became * 1
I ' useful member of the establishment. He wsb <
I jiermitted to attend city customers, and occasion- 1
I ally accomjKiny an old drummer to the hotels, to t
I bore the country merchants. In a short time, 1
I however, lie out off lus leading strings and fairly {
H launched into the vortex of drummers, an accom- t
I plidied borer, and a good statesman.
Till he had passed his twentieth birth-day, bis 1
I j?arents hod watched with a jealous cure his mo- I
I ral and religious conduct, and tho most fastidious I
churchman could find no fault with him. His 1
friends pointed him out as a youth of greut pro- e
jj& flk mi so, and more-than one motlicr had mi eya on t

I The oceupution of Charles Emlen was onoli
that csu??a him lo be en^a^a at thoatot?^Un^
to 'business,' and Ms Ujhcf buying no reason to i
doubt the Vet-deity of bis son, the excuse was held 1
Rood, with no occasional dash of his approbation 1
H| ?nn much industry. U t
Although Charles was a nice young roan, yet i
KP he was ratlier an old one in the ways of a city life, t
Billiards and ten pins were found to be both \
W healthful and gcintlcmanly, while Dundee bells, t
foils and boxing'poVes, were quite as indispensable
to strengthen his nerves, as bear's .grease or i
bergamont to beantifk his person. i
His accoropluhftwats on these articles, how- ?
over, were unkntfwn to his parents ; in fuct, they c
woufti have been highly ofTonded if any gpod na- a
tared busy-body, or ititermoddliitg old aunt, bad r
I even hinted at such things being within a poesibi- (
lily, much less a genuine reality. s
Charles was a shrewd young fellow, (but what \
clerk in Codar struct is not ?) and be pulled the r
wool over tho oyes of his pa arid roa in a scicnti- t
He manner. When they thought be was at the <]
store, if tboy bad looked in at the theatre, they \
might have aeon that bo was not. When *thoy V
imagined that ho was imbibing the true knowledge \
and quaffing off" streams of wisdom from the musty 1
volumes at tho Mercantile Library, had they t
]>oppod |boir beads into No. 9, at our old friend I
Handy Welsh'*, they might have aeon Master V
Charles with some fellow clerks and country mer- t
chanu, intently discussing the merits of an oyster (
stew, or the wing of & snipe; washing down the ?
* same little delicacies with the Anchor Brand, or
" Otard'a sparkling and bright. <
Our clerk, all this time, showed an external- i
- apathy to the pleasures of this world, when in i
' the presence of nis brothers and sisters, and if in- f
vited to accompany them to a party, invariably ]
declined. -Business was to him everything; no- 1
thing cooM be gotontofhltn but business. i
"Hie will live and die a confirmed old bachc- i
lor." Lucy would say/ f
"You are right, sister;" t^c gentle Mary would i
reply, "he is absolutely ruining his h?*)?b by such
* close application to his employers inter#*ts.

Good, iunoomft girts. How kind and considerate!
What, a fluttering there would be with
your dear little hearts, if you only knew how he
spent his evenings. You would then be able to

" Surely you do not inteud to follow them

" By all means, Miss Lucy; it is your duty tc
know how that palo haggard cheek of your brother
is brought on."
" I consent, but it is a bitter experience."
We arrive at the Ball room, and are admitted
with reluctance, because we object to leave our
cloaks, See. We apologise, saying our wish is
merely to see a dance, and retire ; we ?get into a
corner, but can 9ec everything that is going on}

her brother has been practising on the ?unily.

vhorch, nnd still be Ungors. Lucy frets for his
ofety, and her eyes are red and swollaft .from
veoping. At length a noiso is heard ut the street

and the door gently closed, bolted and

>cen left lighted for him, and by the help of the
>annistcrs manages to reach his chamber, much to
ho gratification of Lucy, who follows him on tin
oe, expecting every moment to see him foil back
und kill himself.
The poor girl having folly satisfied herself aq to
?use of Charles* absence from home every evellwy
went to her bed almost distracted. In- j
oxication's deep and damning enp was fast on-!
gulphing another victim, and that victim her beloved
brother. O, how she tossed on Iter sleepless

who had just descended from the upper
part of the house; his mind appeared depressed,
and his thoughtful Countenance licspoke
something serious agitating within. His lips
were compressed ard lie evidently felt ill at
ense. A death-like silence prevailed; as if each
one was afraid to speak.
"Doctor, is there no hope for my little boy?
can nothing save him!"
"Nothing, my denr madam, I can flutter you no
longer with hope. He will be a corpse ere three
days." ^
A silent and affectionate tear startod to the eye
rff each. The dio was cast; the edict had gone
forth, and death was about to claim his own.?
Medical skill was called in, in vain; tho ruinous
seeds of Acobol bed been too firmly planted in
the vitals of Charles Emlin to bo eradicated again,
and the misguided yogth snnk to a premature
grave,a victim of pleasure and a deceiver, both to
himself and those who lovod him.
Oirthe death of Charies being announced, consumption
was charged with the crime of adding
one more to its catalogue; midnight hours at labor
in Cedar street were denounced, and merchants
charged as murderers of their young, confiding,
and overwrought clerks. Oh! Consumption! thou
art a cloak for a far more potent and delusive enemy
than myself, bad as thou art; hundreds have
?no down to the drunkard's grave, whose sins

WADDY THOMPSON'S LETTER,
(Continued.)
Not so with Texa?. There would be no means
of transporting troops to Texas but by the dat^e- .
rotis navigation of the Gulf; thus encountering all
the inconvenience in the defence which an invad- J.
ing enemy would have in the attack ; and with a
superior hostile naval force in command
Gulf of Mexico* which is to bo anticipated
event of such an invasion, our troops could not be ;
transported at all. In any ovent, it would be {
transferring the conflict from the land, where we
should be absolutely impregnable, to the water,
where we might be the weaker power. Then, |
ogatn, instead of die impassable swamps lying between
the Mississippi and Toxas, a natural and ,
impregnable fortification, we should have an in- <
creased marine frontier of several hundred miles j
and a land frontier of two thousand miles, without i
rivers, mountains, or swamps, or any the lightest i
natural barrier, unless we could realize the very \
bright idea of General Cass of Annexing alt the <
contiguous territory. To do which, we must round ^
off our boundaries by going to Cape Horn and the t
Pacific. I know only one instance of an oqually I
sagacious suggestion, as that of General Caas about i
contiguous territory, and that was of the furtner \
who said that he discovered that the squirrels des- a
troyed only the outside rows of his corn, and to r
secure himself from future depredations by plant- c
ing no outsid* rows. If I am descending from t
the dignity of the subject, it is because ridicule is r
the only proper reply to such an argument. It is f
said that the annexation of Texas will increase the ),
political power of tho slaveholding States, and p
theit vote in Congress. Such cannot be the re- v
suit in the Houso of Representatives; for the a
slaves will only be diffused ; their number will not a
be increased ; that is perfectly clear. But it has tl
been said that Texas will be divided into four or n
five States, all of which will be sl&veholdine States. I ?
and ol course represented in the Sinate, and thus f<
give to the South a conservative, a checking, pow- c
cr. If I believed that the non-slavcholding States p
would concede us this, I would disregard all mi- ^
nor objections and go for the measure. But does &
any sane man really believe It! Will the non- tl
slaveliolding States, having the majority, in the ^
Senate, a? a legislative body, surrender that ma- ?
jority, and also the majority in the House, as an t,
alternative electoral body of President! Will
they divide Texas in four States, and give to those ^
four States toual^power in the election of Presi- b
dent wit^ Kev f York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and I ti
Would we, under like circum- ai
MN^eonsent to the annexation of Canada, and c
uivide it into four or five States I Would we do o
this too at tho risk of a foreign war ; and the more b
especially if otfr Northern brethren, with a most a
remarkable frankness, wore to announce to us that ?]
their great motive in desiring it was to take the fi
political power out of our hands and place it in j
their own! And are they less sagacious in per
ceiving their interests, lose prompt to pursuothem, f j
oggfr lfdiwiliiij 'is wmi uW fciwwtl WBWWB W WWl'f?
charactor. A striking fact in this matter is, that at v
the very threshold of this question, it has been n
proposed by two Senators from slaveholding ]<
States (Mr. Benton and Mr. Henderson) to divide h
Texas into an equal number of slaveholding and jt
non-slaveholding States. What, then, will we rr
have gained in political strength ! If Southern s<
Senators begin by making this concession, there p
must be some show of reason on that side. And \\
is it to be supposed that the members from non- tli
ilaveholding States will yield the point! As to p
the Missouri compromise, the obvious reply which a{
will be made will be, that that compromise was w
madn ivith rfif?w>i>/>? tn '.'l"-1- *-*? .1-? *
vv? ?.W?J HUIVU ?u? mull tn
included in the Union, and not to future acquisi- p<
;ion* by purchase or conquest. In ease of such a to
livision, shall we liave gained anything by having ci
iori-slaveholdin"g States of the Union on our south- ar
vestern border instead of a foreign non-slavehold- fr
ng State. I decidedly prefer the latter , for it is w
iot to be denied that our Northern brethren, hi re
bis respect at least, "a little more than kin, and a co
ittle less than kind," often commit outrages upon is
?ur rights, which would not he submitted to from dc
l foreign power; and, besides, if non-slavehold- re
ng States of the Union were established there,
ve should have the dangerous element of politi- it
-al and party feeling, which would not exist in the
:ase of a foreign nou-slavcholding State. h?
But the real question is not between Texas, a Pi
oreign non-slave holding State, and Texas, divid- in
fd into an equal number of slaveholding and non- ge
ilsvenolding States of the Union; but it is between ox
Texas thus divided if admitted into the Union, and al
Texas, if not annexed, an undivided slaveliolding at
sountry. My life upon it,'Texas will not consent; ei
Ive per cent, of her population can never be sii
>rought to consent to the abolition of slavery. C
\nd we should thus have aslaveholding Republic ei
>n our l>order, with similar institutions and inter- is
ets, and which must, from necessity, bo our friend 01
tnd ally, and which would serve as a breakwater fo
letween us and our non-slaveholding- neighbor, w
ind would guard our frontier ; to use a familiar th
Uustration, enjoying all the advantage which I do tr
vith my neighbor whose farm joins mine, while U
le has to keep up the fence, which nevertheless tli
protects my crop as much as it does his own. tli
But if it is really intended that all the States to to th
treated out of Texas are to bo admitted as slave- si
lolding States, why was it not so stipulated in the im
reaty?why was it not thfis "nominated in the at
j^ndt" Was it intended to steal a march on the to
ion-siaveholdirig States?to be silent now upon
hat point, and hereafter insist upon it 1 If so, it ai
ihouJd have been remembered, that in the body in
-
n iiivu IIHI81 uBciut- mm question me non-sJavehold- la
ng States hare the majority. ei
I solemnly declare that, in a recent visit to the th
North, I have seen no single man that was witling
? receive Texas divided into slave-holding Stutos el
nto the Union, nor of the very few Northern a;
cresses which advocate the measure, have I seen w
i single one which does so on the ground of its to
giving security to the institution of slavery, I he- at
leve it is almost universally advocated b^' she w
'c\v at the North who are in favor of the mea- w
uire upon exactly opposite grounds. Will any in
ending politician of the North come out and say \s
hat he is in favor of dividing Texas into three or v?
'our slave states, and receiving them as such into th
:he Union? Will Mr. Buchanan, of Pennsylva- tn
'iia, say so 1 I am not to ho frightoned "from my h?
propriety" by the fear of Texas forming some nl- lo
liance with England disadvantageous to our in- co
'.crest. This is on old story. Gen. Hunt, as the of
1'exian Minister, held out the same idea more th
than seven years ago. Why has such an alliunce rc
never been entered into ? Surely Texas has 7a
Hood more in need of it than she does now. I A
have known a hesitating swain led to the altar by
his fair ladv, threatening him that it he did net ar

tttarry her she would marry some one else. One
scarcely knows this phantom, for it is perpetually M
changing its shape. First it was, that u wodid 4f
not receive Texas, she would throw herself into
tue arms ol England as a colony or dependency.
Then again it was, that England was to guaranty
thu independence of Texas upon the condition of
the abolition of slavery; and the last version ??,
that England is to interpose, forcibly if need be,
and pat an ond to tho war, without any condition
aa to abolition. As to the two first versions, England
has over and over again disolaimcd any I
such purpose, and I know no similar instance in I
her whole history of her condescending to repeat
a disclaimer once already made and hot credited.
England is not tho couotry to do a mean apd
sneaking thing. A wrong and an arrogant one
ihe may do, but that "old and haughty nation" is

say, in this connection, that i can see no justification
for the-jealousy and vituperation of England
.vhich is so common with a certain class of politi- I
:ians. I believe that there is no country in the
vorld with which it is so much tho interest, and
herefore the policy of England to cultivate frtendy
relations as the United States. We consume t
early one-fourth of the productions of English,
abor. This bond of interest is enough,, but there
re others (of not less force,) in language, laws,
ace, and free institutions; for, with the exception
if our own country, there is no other where all
he securities of private rights, and all the guaanties
of public liberty are so numerous and per :
eot as in England. It is not upon us that England
ooks with jealousy, bnt upon the powerful
Kuisms oi tne X>ortn ot Jtiurepe; and in a contest
zitTi them, a.contest between unlimited monarchy
nd the representative principle, she looks to us
s allies, not as enemies. That England desires
tie independence and prosperity of Texas, we do
ot doubt. Do we differ with her in this, or shall
rc quarrel with her on this account 1 It is perjctly
natural, too, that England and all other'
ommercial nations prefer to see Texas 'an indeendent
power, with her markets open to all the
rorld, than to have her annexed to our Union,
nd fenced in with our prohibitory tariff. And is
te South disposed to enter upon this crusade of
nnexingall ''contiguous territories" for the sake of
jcuring their markets for the Northern manufacires
t
1 think it extremely improbable that England
rill put in jeopardy tno large capital employed
y her subjects in Mexico, her profitable commerce
lere, and the fifteen millions of specie which she
nnually derives from that commerce, by any foriblc
iuterposition in favor of Texas. The whole
f the English West India and American estalishments
are paid with the specie thus derived ;
nd I do not see, if this supply is cut off, how the
leflciency can be supplied. That the abolition of
lavery will be made the condition of such interposition,
1 unhesitatingly say is not true ; and if it *5
were, I as confidently assert that Texas will re
m fryin nn nnv well ff rm*. T>r > * *
nJependonce upon the condition of abolishing m'ery
there, no one can believe who knows the "*
fian. He is the very last mail iu the world to be
;d off by such a sickly, caotigig philanthropy. I
avc strong reasons for saying that he has no prcidices
against African slavery ; and, like a wise
tan as no is, would have no great objection to
se i* introduced into Mexico. I will not be reannsible
that the characteristic sensibility to insult
1*11 a ^
men ociongs to tlio Uastilian blood, and which
te Mexicans inhciit from their ancestors, may not
recipitate them, in a moment of resentment
rainst us, to do that with a view to injure us
Inch no other inducement could have tempted
icm to do. They ore an impulsive and violent
sople, and in n moment of passion there is nothing'
o rush and violent for them to do; and all the
rcumstances connected with the Texas treaty,
id particularly the beleaguering their cities and
ontiers with our armies and navies, will deeply
bund and irritate them. Treat him with proper
spect, and the proud and generous Spaniard will
ncedo you any thing ; wound his pruie, and he
for evor your enemy. Any injury, however
tep, he will promptly forgive; an insult or disspect,
never.
As to the late treaty, I should have voted against
1st. Because the President and Senate of Texas
*1 na just power to make such ^treaty. The
resident and Senate cannot change the most uniportant
law ; still less can they chango the ormic
low, and exercise the power which above all
hers requires the action of the people, whero
one sovereign power resides?that of ceding
vay their whole country, and merging its cxistice
in another power. The power of the Predent
and Senate ix nruler tlie flnvi>rmnnnt
onstitution of Texas?not to abrogate tbat CJov nment
and Constitution. Thia, it will be said,
a matter of form more than of substance^ Forms
-e often very substantial things, and certainly no
rms are of a character more sacred than those
hich are provided for acta of such magnitude as
e transferring tlie entire sovereignty of a couny
1 Could the President and Senate of the
nited States do such an act 1 If not, what is
ie difference in the two cases 1 It may be, in
e more degenerate days of our own Republic,
at a corrupt President and Senate may moke
icb a treaty with some foreign power. Let us
>t acknowledge that such an act would possess
iy binding obligation. It is no answer to this
i soy that there is no doubt that the great majorir
of the Texas people approve the treaty. Would
i edict of the President, altering the penal law
the District of Columbia, have the authority of
w without regular legislative enactment, even if
rery member of Congress and every voter in
ie United States approved it I
2d. The treaty is objectionable, because it is in
feet a declaration of war without the action and
iprobation of the House of Representatives. It
ill not do to tell me that there is no war. I have
0 recently sqen Mexican castles filled with Tex1
p'riaoueftt,; trittwphal procession*, with banners
aving which had been tuken in battle, and men
ilh the blood yet running from wounds received
those battlos. And is it really true that there
no war; or is it, on the contrary, true that tho
iry exigencies into winch Texas is thrown by
at war constitute the main inducement to this
eaty, from an apprehension that the necessities of
ir position and her inability to maintain herself
nger in the conflict, will force her, if wo do not
me to the rescue, to throw herself into the arms
some other strong Power ? For an answer to
is question, let any impartial man read the corspondence
