POLITICAL.
From ili Madisonian.
TO MY PtENDS TBiHOUoUT T11 E UtCN.
The reasons erhieb influenced me in 9c
cepting the nomination for the Presidency,
.made by a Conieitio .of thy frieiids in.
May. last, a Baltimore, have lost much of
their iiginIal firce. I had been udt only
fiJobt violentlj assailod by the Uliraiits of
both parties, but had been threatened with
impeachieut fNr haitig. negotiated a
Treaty propuosirg the. annexation ofrTeaa
to the Union; is a pdriioni of its Territory,
and for haviig adopted precautionary mea
eire. clearly falling Within the range. , f
Executive disvretioni io ward off dny lilow
which might have been ietiously aimed at
the peace and safety Oflthe country in the
event of the railication of the Treniy liy
the Senate. The tpinionl of a person,
once raihked ariiongst the distinguished ju
risus of the country; found its waj into the
newspapers, a ppareutly ai the precursor
of such a prbreedirig.
A rep'ort had also beeh made, al a pre
iloni sessioti or Condress, by a comniiiee
6t the House of Regrebetttaives, which
proceeds from the pen of aman who filled
no limited pace in the eye of the notld;
in whi h-because of the exercise of the
Veto yoei iin arrest of ihe unconstitutionial
and pernici fs measurei of a United States
Bank. and a donafion to the States of so
much of the pnblie rcende as was derived
from the public lands, at a moment otgreat
embarrassment in the Trrasury, and when
loans were necssarf to suslain the Gov
ernmen-! was cligid *ith the 6onimnig
sion of grave offences in the ahove partic
ulare, nd with deserving all the paini and
dlisgrifee flo ing from the high poiver.6f
impeachmnent, a measure, as it *at inti
mated. only not resorted to by the House
because of a dotifui ntertajnbd hether
the proteeding would hesnitain'id by pub
lie sentiment. I had, it is trie, Otolestod
against that report io riinatingin wron'd;
and dictated by party iinnor and nateiv
lence; hut my Protest was refused a' place
an thejourntts of the Ilouse, and t'us, in
fuit.re times, my name might have been
iaroished by the -fact of a solemn declara
rion, highly implicating my charneter, re
mnaining uncontrnlicd and unrerersed
it the public journals.
The party majority which had satietion
'd a proceeding so unjust, had, it is true,
been swept out of existence by the elec
ions which shortly afterwards followed;
4ut, at the time of my acceptance of the
tomination, although a large and over
awheltming majority of the opposite party
tad been brought into power by the pen
ple, as if not the express pturpose of mus
aimug me in what I had done, yet that
very party had tmade no public movement
indicative of a friendly feeling, and a por
itin of its members. who seemed to con
trol the rest, exhibited the bitterest hostility,
and the most unrelenting spirit of opposi
ion. Under these circumstances, there
% as but line course left to. me consistent
with honor. which was to mtaaintdin my
position unmoved by tireats, and untimi
laited by denunciation: Those of ,my
enuntrymen who had coti'e to my..supoori,
had done so in a' self-seacrificing .ppieil.
without the indulgence of aty other ex.
pectation than that tny chaiact'r should
be vtndicated, and that the poli'c.of' My
adt inistration should he sustaihed sand I
felt that it would better. beconie men.1 to
nbide the t6691 signal defeat ia.tncur
'he digr ae of d ep-ecating the action of a
party. t'he chief object of whi; lsaders
seemed to be to fastetV 6oie. disgrae.
I hnd also.an .ihIjatirte6iift thai.the great
question of this annexation of Teas might,
to somue dgr'ede be controlled by the posi
titon I occupied.
iihese motives ijii'ced niy acceptatnce

hBefore the close of thie session of.Congress,

The voice of the People in the elections of
1842 wyas titus directly responded to-by
that of their Representatives,.and b~ut little

.Since the adjournme~t of Congfecs, the
fatigiiage of many of the leadinug'presles~
of the counttr'y, and resoltations adopted by
large assemsblages of the people irn their
primary meetings, have still furshier en
dorscd the proceeditngi'. of the House in
iprobationt of the acts of the edministra

sively to my own wishes, whiclr woiild
have led me imnmediat'ely to'riire from a
contest which eemed no longer to bi pos

I cannotornit to accompany this publli
annuticiuttn 'With a few rerharks, addres
sed. to the Republican portion of what wa
called the Whig paty of 1840. I rinak
no appeal to that other portion, which wa
farinerlyK laidiwi during the earli period h
our political history, as Federalists; at I
later day as National Repablicans, an<
iow pass under the gideral appellatiid a
Whigs. Such ad appeal would be whollh
dut of ilace, since theiir political principile
are-entirely at war with ilidie I have ad
vocated thidugh lif*e. I meant no imputa
tion ou their motives or patriotism. I
doubt not that ihe old Federal party, it
thd lead of whiich stood the elder Adams
were as deeply and sincerely corvitwbel il
ihe ieiesity or the Alien and Sediti
land, as the present is of thai of a Bank W

equally latitudinous, alonig wiih the abo

aodd independeni Staici. by which so much
power, aid no more, has been granted t.
a common Agent of all (lie States, as the
esteerietl. td be reCessary for the promo
Oion of their mutual happiness. No: to
them I hafe ndthing to say. If I had re
ceived their support at any titne, it has
bben, nit frorii attabhmerit to me or my
political irinciples, but from soihe suppi
ied inifutence whicl i niighi bring to bedr.
as a secondary agedt, in advancing their
purposes.
All the obhigations which I have recei
ved for such reasous, have been more tilian
countetbalanced by the untiring oppositi.in
which I have encounterid at thelr bauds
since I attained inh, pres'ent station. and
the co'iarit anl uu.iliigated abuse Which
their leadere haie poured out in a torrent
upon my head ; designed, as f 4'erily be
lieve, id the fiait instance, to drive me
front the Goverunment; and in the last to
oyerwhefm me wi.th obloquy and reproach.
But I hive a right to, address myselfto
those w ho, likc myself. co.ope-ated with
them ini thIe contest of lS40-iWho were,
and always had been the advocates ofthe
principles of the old Republican party
w hose streruousefiris have always been
directed to. preserving the comp:ct of
Union unbroken and inviolate-who have
sustained at all times the principles of the
Republican party of 17989-who have
participatej..from time to time, in all Re
publican iumphs-whose fathers were
victorious over the elder Adams in the
election of Air. Jefferson, as they them
-elves were over the youngsr in the election
of General Jackson.
To this nioriion of the. Whig party of
1840, I feel that I have a full rimhr to ad
dreas myself. and I now seriously put it
to them to say, whether any expectation
of good to the country.*which they' had
forted.in the election of .General Harri
son and tmyself to the Presidency and Vice
Presidency, has ben disappointed 1 Many
