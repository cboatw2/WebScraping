ere this to seize these Chiefs, and their <
warriors whenever opportunity offers.
The time has passed for negotiation with <
these savages, or rather to use a legal i
phrase, it has expired by the statute of
limitations. It is to be regretted that the i
gallant Col. Riley had not orders to catch |

perhaps still more to be regretted that (
Coacoochee and twenty six of his warriera
who were with him at Fort Pierce,
Were not detained and furnished with ,
quarters at that post.
The upshot of ail this will be that the
Indians will take the field again, although 1
Ihey are evidently so tired of fighting, that I
if they had any enoouragoment to act in
good faith, by ?Jhe application of a severe I
rule on ourv part, they would be more 1
punctilious in the performance of their ]
promises. Our troops will doubtless have i
another summer campaign. They are |
now so well acquainted with the country,
lhat they will burn up all the crops of the
Indians and distress them exceedingly, |
which will lead, in all probability, to their
surrender in fhe ensuing autumn.
Our informant states that of 165 men
at Port King, 106 were sick. In addition
to the above items of intelligence, we may
add that several rumours have reached us
^ from our Correspondents, that the command
in Florida will soon he confided to
the gallant CoL Worth. We give the rumour
as we have heard it. If it be true,
we are prepared to say that a better selection
could not well have been made.

WEDNESDAY, Jun* 16, 1841.
Tba Editor is again at his post.
The dwelling and office of Dt. Hopton '
of this town were both struck by lightning, <
during a thunder storm, last Thursday
evening. The dwelling was set on fire,
but the fire'was extinguished before it did
much injury. Some of the office furni.
tura was also broken, but the damage
was not gjrpat. The house was not pro- .
tected by.? lightning rod. The house of
Col. McCreight was also struck during '
the same akywi, but no injury done* It i
has a lightning-rod which is isolated with ,
horn. The wateh absorbed by the horn <
may possibly have acted as a conduc- <
tor of thd-ertectric fluid to the iron ring ;
which surfobnded it. There is perhaps <
no town of village in the State in which i
ao many houses and trees have been
struck by lighting as Cheraw. Owing i
to some unknown cause, there is probably (

^ Documents Accompanying the Prbsi*
bent's Message.
These documents are free from the
(motility of most American state papers.
They are brief, practical and to the point.
They of -course advocate the political
doctrines; and the favorite measures of
the party now in power. The greater
part of the report from the head of the ,
Treasury Department will be found in i
our columns this week. In future numbers
we shall furnish such parts of the
ether reports as shall give those of our
readers who see no other paper a view of
the state of the country, so far as it is |
exhibited in these documents.
The National Gazette states that the
mission to England has been offered to
Mr, John Seege ant, member of Congress
from Pennsylvania. It is not yet known
whether he anil accept it or not.
We spent a day or two in Washington
the early- part of last week. There
seemed to be a very general disposition
among the members of Congress to enter
promptly and efficiently upon the bustnets
before them. This the Senate Has
likely to do; but the House of Representative*,
which is a more unwieldiy body,
and contains some intractable spirit*,
was more slow in its movements. The
general expectation was that a bank bill
would be passed in both houses, by decided
majorities; and it was hoped also
by the friends of the measure that one
might be framed which would be approved
by the President. But nothing more had
^ transpired in regard to the President's
opinions o* the subject than is contained

wu rumored that the subject was the
topic of consideration at successive cab.
inet meetings about the time we were
in Washington; but such rumors we
thought entitled to little credit. The
President and his ministers, generally
and very properly, confine to themselves
their secret councils till the proper time
arrives for divulging them.
Congress.
A joint committee, was, on the motion
of Mr. Adams, appointed, early in the
4c*6ion, t# report on the death of Gun.?
Harrison. Their report recommended ri
that the chairs of the presiding officers
be shrouded in mourning, during the ses. tt
sion, that the members and officers wear w
the usual badge of mourning for 30 days, tl
and that a copy of the resolutions be sent x\
to Mrs. Harrison. The resolutions were H
unanimously adopted in the House. We
happened to be in the gallery of the Sen- A
ate chamber when they were taken up,
and heard a solitary no on the question w
of their passage. It was in the hack part 81
of the chamber, and every member looked tl
back with & suddenness and expression S
of countenance which indicated surprise
more strongly than language could do.?
We did not learn tfho the Senator was a!
that thus attracted unenviable attention,
hut we observed that he had not the
courage to raise his voice on the subse- ^
quent readings of the resolutions.
The same committee also Reported a ^
bill to pay the widow of General Harrison p
[blank] dollars. The sum contemplated j
by the committee was a year's Salary of
the President, or 925,000. The bill will ?

According to a vote of the Senate, C
the President pro. tern, of the body sub- d
sequently appointed the other members of
the committees. I
On motion of Mr. Clay, the Committee
on finance was instructed to inquire into
the expediency of repealing the Sub. v
Treasury act. The committee reported J
a bill for that purpose, on Friday the 4th.
June. The bill was taken up and discussed ^
on Monday and Tuesday the 7th and 8th, I v
md passed on the latter day by a vote of |
30 to 16, ail the Whigs and Conservatives
voting for it, and all the Democrats ?
igainst it,except Mr. Buchanan of Pcnn- C
sylvania, who stated that he voted for the I
repeal, against his own judgment, but in
obedience to instructions from the Legis. C
lature of his state. I
On the 8th June, Mr. Clat offered a
resolution calling on the Secretary of the
Treasury for a plan of a Bank, adapt. c
ed, in his opinion, to the public service, j
This resolution gave rise to considerable r
- - ? .-it 1/: I
debate in whicn Messrs V/iav, rung,
Woodbury, Wright, Calhoun, Buchanan \
and Rives took part, and the resolution (
was finally adopted, after being so modi- J
tied as to call for the plan of a "fiscal;
agent or bank1' instead of a "bank" aim- ii
ply. ?
On the 7th Mr. Clay offered a set of l
resolutions specifying the following as
the subjects to be acted upon at the pres. ^
ent extra session: 1. Repeal of the *
sub-treasury ; 2. The incorporation of
a bank; 3. Providing revenue by du. J
ties and loans to pay the debt contracted j
by the last administration; 4. Prospective
distribution of the proceeds from
thepuhbc lands; 5 Appropriation hills; j
6. Modification of the banking system
of the District of Columbia. He said *
it was not his intention, then, if at all, to s
call for a vote on these resolutions. He
offered them only as an expression of his H
opinion as to the business which ought a
to occupy the attention of Congress at
the present session. They were, on his *
motion laid on the table and ordered to j

On the first day of the session Mr. Wise
moved that a committee of nine be
raised to revise the rules, and that till j
their report be made, the House be 'gov.
erned by the rules of last session. Mr. t
Adams moved to except the 21st rule 1
which provides that petitions on any sub. i
ject relating to slavery be laid on the
table without debate. Mr. Adnms con.
sumed nearly all the first week, and
Monday of the second week, in discus*

on Monday June 7th by a vote of 112 to *
104, being a majority of 8 for the repeal
of the rule which excludes the considers. !

To a young infidel who scoffed at
Christianity because of the misconduct of
ome professors, Dr. Mason said: " Did
ou ever know an uproar to be made be.
ause an infidel went astray from the
ath of morality?" The infidel admitted
hat he had not. "Then," said the doc.
or, "don't you see that you admit that

ay it the highest compliment in your

A Shropshire farmer went along with

He tnfd him to go and speak to

tors all appeared to be in good health and !*'
spirits.
Mr. White wast levied on the first bal*
lot, having 121vdtesout of 221 that were
given. Mr. Wise received 8 votes, Mr. gi
Lawrenee of Pa. 6, Mr. J, W. Jones, 84, w
and there were a few scattering, There k
were six Whigs who did not vote at all,
hut who would eventually have voted for _
Wise, in case he obtained such a sup. m
port as would have rendered their votes
available.
The Caucua nominee for the Clerkship
did not succeed so well. Mr. F O J
Smith obtained 80 votes on the first bal. .
lot, and the same number on the second. ^
Ct was evident that his whole force had ^
been brought out and that he could not ..
get another whig vote. , It appeared also'
that Mr. Clarke, the old and very efficient
officer, who waa turned out by the Jackaon
party, eight years ago, waa the choice (
of the non?content whig*, though he ?
could only raise 88 whig votes. The y
locos had an invincible repugnance to go. c
ing for Mr. Smith, for two reasons?one p
that he waa a conservative, and the other t
that he waa the regular candidate of the t<
whig party* They would not give him (
one vote; and, finally, they adopted Clarke i
as their candidate, and gave him nearly p
eighty votes, by which he was elect, p
ed. '
A resolution was adopted for the ap. 1
pointment of a joint committee to wait I
on " the President," and inform him that f
the two houses were assembled sod ready t
to receive any communication from him. I
While this was under consideration, Mr. t
McKeon, of New York, moved to strike J
out the wprda " President of the U.S." i
and insert *Vice President of the U. S., .
acting as 'President." Mr. McKeon
went intq an argument tn shew that Mr. ,
Tyler bad no claim te the title of Presi. ,
dent, tbcyghi the powers and duties o' ?
that office devolved on him. j
Mr. Wise resisted this view, and hoped
the House would.recognise Mr. Tylckss
President?he hiving become the Presi.
dent by the action of the Constitution, 1
by the votes of the people, and by the act 1
of God. The House was unwilling to I
entertain any discussion of the subject, *
and rejected the motion very promptly. 1
Mr. Wise moved that the rules of the 1
laat House be adopted for the government of
this for the present, and that a com* 1
mittee of nine he appointed to revise the !
rules forthwith., Mr. Adams r..oved to '
amend the motion hy rescinding the 21st
rule, which rule was adopted at the be.
ginning of the laat Congress, for the pur.
pose of excluding abolition petitions.?
Pending this motion, the House adjourn,

made tha motion.

Domestic Silk.
Wecopy the following from the Ral.
eigh.Stsr of last week.
We had the pleasure of inspecting, s
few days ago, some articles of silk, which
casually fell under our observation, raised ,
I in the family of Cyrcs Whitaker, Esq.
of this country; and manufactured by Mrs.
Whitakrr herself, which are decidedly
the handsomest specimen of domestics
we have yet seen. They consist of gloves
stockingsand hanks of reeled silk, which
we believe to be equal in all, and superior
in some repects to the finest productions
of the kind imported from France or Italy. 1
The silk is "beautiful, like threads of s:i.
* 1 al.a.i" a nrt i
ver4 ana as even huu miiuuih
the ellegant manner in which it was
wrought manifest a (degree of skill nnd
ingenuity which would do honnor to the
most experienced manufacturer. We
love to hold up such laudable examples for
the imitation of our fair country women.
The successful experiment* which have
beenmadejin the silk culture, have opened a
field for the profitable exercise of their
industry and entcrprizc, which we hope
they will not neglect to improve,
SUMMARY.
A little girl in New York wa? thrown
into severe convulsions, produced hy
fright, on being shut up in a dark room
as punishment. The attending physician
at one time entertained doubts of the re*
covery of the child. The child is hap.
| pily restored.
Curious?The mesne provided by na.
ture, whereby t silkworm escapes from
the coecona, are worthy of notioe.
Immediately at the mouth of the insect
there js a small sack into which it stu
cretes>ene drop of very sharp and corro*
jive acid. At the time for the escape of
the little animal, the sack bursts anc the
acid destroys the fibre o! the silk which it
touches, and thus makes a hole through
which the moth creeps into the open
air. Is this arrangement the effect

BLOODY SCENES.
The last St. Augustine Herald, after
noticing the cold-blooded assassination ol
Ken. Reid, in Tallahassee, states that
great excitement existed, and that there
ippeared some disposition to wrest the
murderer from the hands of justice. In
& postscript, it adds: "We learn that the
sheriff of Leon county was compelled tc
shoot a man, who is not expected to re.
cover, and that Harris, the city marshall,
in another affair, was nearly cut to piece*
by a man named Rogers."

Mr. Editor :?Some ten days or a fort
night since, on taking up the Cheraa
