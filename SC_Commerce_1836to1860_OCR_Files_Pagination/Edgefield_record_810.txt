had been assailed..
Mr. Geddings declining to make an ex
plicit statement of the complaint he inten
ded to make, the objection was persisted
Mr. Schenek move.s a suspension of the
rules, so that Mr. G. might speak, but
without success.
The article of the Globe refers to the
speech of:Mr. Geddings in Ohio when,it is
alleged be endeavored to create the im
pression that it was Henry Clay instead
of G. M. Clay who had sent him a letter
approving the corse of the abolitionists.
This matter having been disposed of.
Mr. Wilkins from the Select .Committee
to whom had been referred the petitiot of
W. Jones a colored man in our city jail,
arrested on suspicion of being a fugiuve
slave, made a report, accompanied by a
bill. The report does not recommend any
legislative interference in this case, inas
much as the Committee think the petition
er can obtain redress from the Courts. It
ads fault however with the existing laws
as imperfect, and in some cases as oppres
sive. The bill therefore provides that cer
tain portions of the laws shall berepealed,
and others enacted in their stead, so that
it shall be required of the claimant of a
slave to prove his property.. A minority
teport was also made.
On motion of Mr. Payne. aresolution
was adopted,instructing the Committee on
Elections to inquire into the expediency of
amending the Constitution so that the
votes-for Presidegtand Vce President shall
all be cast on the same day.
After the adoption of numerous resolu
tions of inquiry, the House resumed the
consideration.of: the motion to re-commit
the Report on the Rules, with instructions
to re-insert the 21st Rule.
Mr. Belser having the foor, resumed
and concluded his eloquent remarks from
yesterday. He argued that rule or no
role, the House cannot constitutionally m
ceive abolition petitions.'.
He was followed, on the same side, by
Mr. Cobb of Georgia, who spoke until the
expiration of the morning hour. The sub
ject was then laid over.
The House then went into Committee
of the Whole, and devoted the remainder
of the day to the consideration of the mo
tion to refer to the Committee on Com
merce, that portion of the President's
Message, which relates to the Western
waters.. Mr. Jameson was the only speak
er... His remarks were of no interest.
The wind has been blowing a real bur
ricane-to-day. This afternoon it blew out
several'squares of glass from the dome -of
tihe HoOse. The fragments falling upon
member's heads, caused them to scamper
from their seats in a- most amusing man
ner.
Considerable anxiety is manifested to
read ihe -manifesto, now in type, of the
Qalhoun members, in which it is said, they
give their reasons for seceding from the
Van Buren members.
It is said that some of the Whige intend
giving Mr. Rives a public dinner.
The Senate did not sit to-day.
WAaIrororN, Jan. 15.
The Senate spent but a few moments in
legislative session.
Mr. Benton otrered a resolution, which
lies over, calling for information as to
whether the Wiqnebago annuity, has not
been diverted from its. proper object.
Mr. Breese introduced a bill to tax gov
ernment-lands in Illinois.
The bill to fx an adequate rule of com
pensation for Pension Agents, was reported
* - from the Pension Committee with amend
ments, which make the bill of a prospective
character. It makes no provision for pas5t
After the transaction of some private bu
sitiess, the Senate went into Executive
* session, of several hours on ,tbe Cabinet
uominatione. It is understood that the
nominatlon of Mr. Henshaw was rejected
by a large majority... No action was ;had
on any of the others. Their fate will how
ever be decided daring the present week.
In the House, a great portion of the day
was occupied in the reception of resolutions
calling on the Departments for information
on various mnatters. Some of these resoln
tions are so comprehensive. that it will
take the whole foice of a Department
three months to answer them; yet whben
the information comes, it is seldom of any
practIcal good. Many of the, new -mem
hers, who hate not the ability to make a
speech,.frequently take this mode of letting
their constituents know that they are, not
asleep.
Among the resolutions adopted wias one,
instructing the Committee on Ways and
Means to consider the expediency of re
porting a bill reducing the .halaries of all
-government olicers. .
.Mr. Stewart introduced his resolution,
instructing Ihe Committee od - Ways and
Means to limit the appropriations for the
pi-esent year to the amount appropriated
slastyear. Objection being made it lies
ova.
Mr.-Black gave notice of an antendumem
to the Oregon bill, so as to include the
annexation of Texas. So henceforth.
- these two great questions will be consid
ered together.' .The r-esult may easily be
seen. Nothing will be done with either.
Mr. Cave Johnson introduced a bill 'to
reduce the duty on qalt. Is was read twice,
when he moved its engrossment. But as
other members hadl no idea of such steam
legislation, the motion failed, and the bill
was referred to the' Committee 'on Coin
~merce.
* *'~'A reoltion, providing. for the prinating
fGieenough's history of Oregon, having
been adopted,' a motion was made to re
consider the vote.
It was debated at some length. During
the debate Mr. Wise, incidentally referred
to William and Mary's College, in Virgimn
ta, and told how Washington, M adison,
and other great men received their educa
tiori there..
Mr. Weller said perhaps the-gentleman
himself was educatedthere.
ZMr..Wise said o, he was sent down to
Pennslvg~ia, to receiverbis education. It
was thete~be,got his democratic principle.
Mr Weller said he did not know what
kind of demiocrasic principles those could
.be.
'Mr. Wise saids the .were according to
the standard of dem eay 'in his District.
Mr. Weller, facetiously observed, that
netirhe nor any one else had ever-beet
able to compr ted what kind of a stand
ard that was.
This skirmishing caused much laughter.
On motion of Mr. Thompson, of Ken
tucky, a resolution was adopted, instruct
ing the Committeetn Ways and Means to
ascertain the probable expense of keeping
in employment an adequate number. of
steamboats, for-removing snags in the Mis
sissippi and Ohio rivers.
Mr. T. accompanied the resolution by
some very eloquent remarks relative to
the recent disaster on the Mississippi.
At a subsequent period, Mr. Weller mo
ved $ reconsideration of the vote.
On this motion, a debate arose, which
continued to the adjournment, without
any question being taken.
It. is said that the Post Office Commit
tee are unanimous in their intention to re
port a bill for a reduction of letter postage,
A -proposition is soon to be made to
Congress from the Retrenchment Com
mittee, to appoint a Board whose duty .it
shall be to examine all candidates for
clerkships and other offices. If this could
be carried into effect, the public business
would be much. benefitted. There would
be an end. to incompetent officers. This
principle is applied to surgeons in the Na
vy, to Cadets, and Midshipmen, and why
should it not be extended.
The President has made himself very
popula . among the ladies by his determi
nation t hold a levee every Tuesday even
ing. I believe this has never been done
before.
WAstsiNoToN, Jan. 16.
In the Senate, this morning. Mr. Mc
Duflie gave notice that he will, to-morrow.
call for the consideration of his Tatiff res
olutions. If he succeeds, we may expect
war to the knife's point. As a Senator
remarked the other day, a tariff debate is
like a ball of twine; it .has a heginning
but requires no little paiience to find the
end. 'be general impression still is, that
no action on the Tariff will be had at the
present Session. 'It will be talked about,
and thet is all.
Mr. Berrien, from the Judiciary Com
mittee, reported a bill authorizing the Sec
retary of the Treasury to compromise with
the sureties of Samuel Swartwout.
The resolution of Mr. Breese, relative.to
an amendment of the act, repealing the
Sub-Treasury.law, was taken up, and af
ter some explanation adopted.
Numerous petitions, praying the reduc
tion of postage, were presented and refer
red. A bill on this subjectwill be report
ed '.is week.
After the disposal of some private busi
ness, and the reference of some executive
communications, the Senate went into an
executive session, which lasted several
hours. When the doors were opened,
much anxiety was manifested to hear the
fate of Mr. Spencer, whose nomination it
was supposed had been under considera
tion. It appears, however, that it was not
taken up, the whole time having been oc
cupied on minor nominations. The rumour
that Mr. S. has sent in his resignation, is,
I am told, unfounded.
In the House, Mr. McKay, from the
Committee on Ways and Means, reported
the Pension, Navy and Fortification Ap
'peopriation Bills. The latter contains ac
appropriation of $10,000 for Fort Moul
trie, in your harbor; also an appropriation
of $43,000 fur Fort Sumter. The total
amount of appropriations in the bill is half
a million.
Mr. Wise, from the Naval Committee,
reported adversely on the resolution relative
to the construction of War Steamers for the
Ohio river.
Mr. Davis, from the Committee on Pub
lie Lands, reported a bill to repeal the
Dtstribution Act.
Anter the transaction of a mass of pri
vate and local business, the House re
sumed the consideration of the motion to
reconsider the vote on the following reso
lution, adopted yesterday.
Resolved, That the Commit tee of Ways
and Means be instructed to inquire what
sum of money will be required to keep all
the boats. now in use, and those in the pro
cess of preparationi, designed to be em
ployed itn removing obstructions in the nav
igatton of the Mississippi river and its trib
utaries, in constant active employment for
the national fiscal year commencing on the
first day of Juty next, and that they report
to this H-Iouse the sum for that purpose is
tho appropriate appropriation bill.
Mr. Bowlin having the floor, made a
speech, in which hie set fortb ini glowing
colors, the value of the Western waters,
and the imperative duty of government tc
improve their navigation.
Mr. Stewart, of Penndylvania, followed.
He contended that the general goverunmeni
has full power to make appropriations foi
iuterntal improvement. He declared thai
a protective Tariff will sooni 'af Tord ample
sneans for such objects. In addition tu
this, he was willing to retrench the expen
ditures-for other objects. In the course 01
his remarks, he caught at some observa
tions incidentally~ made by Mr. Holmes,
and appeared desirous of placing him in a
~alat Dositionin regard to this matter.
At a subsequment stge ortheu pr...dings.
Mr. Hiolmies obtained the floor, and gave
Mr. Stewart a regdlar broadside. Mr. H.
udehued his views on the question of inter
nal improvement in general, and that o1
the navigation of the Mississippi. A fter a
most pathetic' oppeal itt reference to the
recent disaster on that river; he, in the
most eloquent manner, besought the House
to act tupon the matter without a moment't
delay. As Chairman of the Committee
on Commerce, his remarks were listenedi
to with great attention..
The debate was continued till the ad
journment, 'iy Messrs. Kennedy and In
gersoll. without taking the question.
Thia motion to reconsider, being a priv
ileged question, takes precedence of all
other business.
WASHilNoTON, Jan. 17.
In the Senate, a great number of poei.
tions asking a reduction of postage, were
presented and referred.
Mr. Merrick, the Citairman of the Post
Ofiice Committee, stated that a bill ort
thib subject is now matured and will ho re.
ported in a day or two. He said there up
peared to be an erroneous impression as t
the seat of the evil in relation to the frank
ing privilege. It was not confined to the
300 enembers of Congress ; but extendec
to the fifteen thousand deputy Post Mas
term throughout thme country. This. evil the
Committee would attempt to remedy.
The Hiuse bill. providing $45,000 foi
the relief and protection of American sea
men in foreign countries, was taken up and
passed.
Mr. Berrien-gave notice of a bill to pro
vide' for a Naval School.
The resolution of the Finance Cammit
tee &Jative to the tariff bill of Mr. McDuf
fie, was not taken up.' It will probably be
considered .to-morrow.
'After some debate on the bill to connect
Fox'and Wisconsin Rivers, the Senate
spent five hours in executive session.
.The nomitnation,of Isaac Hill as Super
intendant of the Navy Clothing Bureau,
was rejected. It is now taken for granted
that all the "democratic" nominees will
share the same fate.
Last night, a great number of the dis
charged workmen at the navy yard, made
a very large bonfire, and burnt ex-Secreta
ry Henshaw in effigy. They also formed
a procession with illuminated carmers; on
one of the carmers was a picture represen
ting Mr. Henshaw gallopping back to Bos
ton on the back of a hog, with a jackass
kicking in front. The workmen considered
Mr. H. a great enemy, and 'a bard task
master.
In the House, we had a very uninter
esting day. The first business was, the
motion of Mr. Cave Johnson tore-consider
the vote on the resolution " ins'rncting the
Committee on Ways and Means to report
an adequate sum for keeping in operation
the snag boats on the Misissippi."
After debate, the motion to re-consider
was carried. The question then being on
the resolution, Messrs. Smith, Hardin,
Bernard, and others, spoke until a late hour.
The resolution was then amended so as to
instruct the Committee to enquire into the
-'expediency" only, and in this shape adop
ted.
Nothing else ofinterest transpired.
The President't levee last night was
well attended. Members of Copgress of
all parties were in attendance.
This eveningthe Post Matter General
gives a grand party.
The Colinization meeting at the Capitol
last night was of a very interesting char
acter. One of the speakers related an an
ecdote of an African prince, who consider
ed that he could not be a -gentleman un
less he had six wives. What despicable
mortals their bachelors must be.

PROSPECTS OF COTTON.
Mes- Editors-The following inter
esting letter from the Journal of Cornmerce,
on the subject of the Cotton Cr01p, we?
think will be found highly interesting tt
your readers. It goes far to settle the
question that under no circumstances, cat
it exceed 1,800,000 bales-and 'hat it .I
highly probable that it may not be ove
1,600,000. If these facts are sustained
the present prices are but the erect of he
gitimate causes, aud not the consequence:
of mere speculation. W.
The followitng is extracted from a letter
not written for effect snd contains some
information:
NEW OaLEAYs, Dec. 30, 184.3.
My lest letter was dated 18th inst., sinci
thou our Cotton market was gite animra.
ted, and the tendency of prices has been a!
ready upwrard, nntil "middling" Cotton
have reached 9e as you will see by thi
quotations at foot. Even at these rates
factors offer their Cotton so sparingly, tha
orders in atny extent cannot be filled. One
of the largest brokers in the city, wit!
whom I am very intimate, informed mi
last night, that of 5000 bales he expecte<
to purchase yesterday, be was only abi
to procure 250, owing .to the factor's de
manding generally 4 to Ad above the quo
tations alluded to. The opinion prevail
here in all commiercial circles (except the
agents of English manufacturers and met
chatits who affect to believe differently
that Cotton will not be .lower this year
and that in all probability it will advanc
id or more before the 1st of March. T
this opinion I subscribe, as the accounts w
are daily receiving from the interior, giv
the most gloomy picture of the irmmrens
destruction of Cottotn in the fields cause
-by the rains which have fallen almost in
ceasantly from the 1st November till tih
23d December, in all parts of the Cottoi
region tributary to this city, and for a grea
portion of the time in the country tributa
ry to Mobile. As yoti are not fam'ilia
with Cotton planting, I will now digress;
little from the Cotton market to the Cotto
plant for the purpose of showing the rea
sons on -which my short crop views ar
predicated.
As a general rule the seed of all plant
which arrive at maturity lall immediatel
to the ground. To this the Cotton planti
somewhat an exception.
The boll or pod in whicll the seed
contained, and to which the Cotton is at
tached, opens gradually, and a portion
the Cotton is fastened .by a gluey sat
stance to the centre of the boll, where
unites with the branch or stalks. Whe
the boll opens, the Cotton gradually prc
ects,. nntil it, hbemaa -a setng e en
some five or six inches ling, when, if not
t picked, it falls to the .grynnd and is.lpst.
Whilst in any portion.of ihe stage I have
I described, (which, in god .weapher,. lasts
I about three weeks from the opening of the
boll.) strong winds or heavy rahis are cer
tain to beat it out. This is uniformly the
I case in a climate where ibe plagt-arrives
I to perfection, but in the highest latitudes
I in which Cotton is grown, are in parts of
Arkansas, Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia
and South Carolina, it possesses more te
nacity, the boll not opening quite so aide
I as it does farther South.. In long rainy
seasons, such as they have experienced in
the above sections of the country in Nov.
I and Dee., the Cotton seed gerininutes in
the pod, and when its growth is checked by
frost, the seed rots, and the Cotton attach
ed becomes comparative worthless. Such
I am informed from sources to be relied n,
is now the case in Arkansas, Tennessee,
North Alabama, and the. Northern boun
baries of IMississippiand Louisiana. Cot
ton picked whilst it has the slightest mois
ture in it, nmust be exposed 'to the sun for
days on scalfolds, which every planter has
provided for that purpose, before it can be
put under rover and considerei secure.
If then, it has rained almost incessantly
for two months, which cannot be denied
by any candid person in possession of the
facts, bow was Cotton to be secured ad
mitting that'it was picked in the rain. (a
very probable thing by the'way,) or whilst
it was not, immediately after the rain?
Three fourths of,thc Cotton crop is gath
ered in the months of October, Noveinber,
and December, and the season for picking
C.zttu ia considered at an end by the mid
dle of January. You must bear in mind
that picking Corton is a very slow process,
and that it takes four months of good
wtterv to gather an average crop; the
avera;e season coImmencitt abott the tid
ile of Sept-bther and ending the middle
of January. No contingency can therefore
arioe a bici g ill tnake the crop exceed 1,
700.000 bales. This I consider a higher
ctatuate than two million bales was on the
lot of November, and so it is considered
by those who bet freely in the beginning of
December. that the crop would exceed I,
800.000 bales, for now the same parties
will not bet on 1,700,000 bales,and betting
is our Southern mode of tesing the sincer
ity of opinions expressed. After weighing
well all matters connected with the present
Cotton crop, I have come to the deliberate
opinion, that, under the most favorable
circumstances, the crop cannot reach 1.
700,000 bales, and that in all human prob
ability it will not exceed sixteen hundred
thottaud bales.
The followiig are now the quotamions of
our market. lnferior 71 a 7$ ; Ordinary 8
a 84 ; dliddling 8- a 9; Middling Fair 94
a 9J; Fair 9J a lU4; Good Fair 10J a 103;
Good ntl Fine lie.

getting bewildered on his way to the Fort,
-wandered about in the snow and overcome
by exposure and fatigue. He was found
in the morning, still alive, but too far- gone
to be resuscitated. The onfortunate man
had a short time previous signed the tem-.

To the Editor of the Temperance dsa.t
My Dear Sir:-As the success of all our.
Temperance bretberen, in any business, is
to evefy friend of the good cause; a uoure'e
or unmixed joy, it affords one of your con
stantt readers great pleasure, to state, that
Mr. John W. Clarke, (who keeps the'only
'I emperance Hotel in Columbia,).during
the last Session of the Legislature, was.
amply patronized notwithstanding the re
p~ort which was spread far and wide, thai
his charges wei-e bigher than those of any
o::er Hotel.
He states, in a letter to-tbe writer of
this short note, "My house was'erowded,
and many supposed they would have-to
pay '3 per day, until their bill was presen
toil. MS charge for those, who atpe at the
exas~ table. wias per day $2, and 37j cas,
for lire: t he other houses, as l am informed,
charged $2. and nothing for ire. I never

This is indeed. as it should be, Ititells

tained. No man better deserves the liber
al countenance, and stipport of the citisens
of South Carolina, thtan John W. Clarke.
Misfortune has fallen heavily upon him,
but in the midst of adversity, he has been
the same honest and firm man, he was in
more prosperous circumstances. After he
had reached that periodof life, when-most
men rest from their active pursuits, he has
been comupelled- to return to his old busi
ness. that or keepitng a Hotel. His house
is as remarkable for neatnemsand order, as
it is for good fare, and good seater.
