JSew Jersey Contested Election.?1 has
been already announced that the Committee
of the U. S. House of Representatives hav'
ing the New Jersey disputed election cas
in charge, have reported that the five Vm
Buren candidates 'received the greases
numb r of la vvul votes." But on examin
ing their report, it appears that by "lawful"
votes they only mean votes "taken at poll.helJ
in conformity with law." Accordingly
they have included in their calculation the
votes of MillviHc and South Amboy, which
, : v r
J- -*/*'- JtL.
. were not inclu>h*d in tlic statement upon
winch liie Governor and Council based
their decision. In short, the csHTimittfie have
r porta l only what is the prima 'ucie evide.accordingto
the returns of the local
officers of the several polls. Upon what
other basis, they ask, could a Report which
was required by the resolution to he made
' forthwith," be constructed ? "Manifes Iv

The House cannot have contemplated
a report, involving an investigation ot the
ballot box*?, without allowing time or
opportunity fur that investigation to be
ihurough.
M The committee arc confirmed in this
construction, and the course consequent
lh??reon, by the consideration that any juug.
mem iooking beyond the face ol the polls,
wt.ich they might base upon the inconclusive
test,mo% in their possession, would be uns
iti:.factory to the House unjust to the parties,
and calculated to produce erroncoi-s
conclusions i ? relation to a mass of lacts
which appair to b > *erifi- d by the oaths o
voters, but which, eirwt'l ?cause of the extrajudicial
administration of the oaths, or
the want of due notice to-the opposite par- 1

I trusf that I have now establish.

Sen.ile, the truth of the great p i elide
which has b? en laid down?that every
inyia ase of protective duties is necessarily

which must continue to increase till the it.*

expulsion, shall be equal to the duty imoo.

customers. To have u just conception of
its operation in this par iculnr, it will b * necessary
iu bear in mind, that the Sou Ii and

of our exports, with a corresponding
increase of the capacity to consume on the
part of the Soutn and West, making lliem
-ieh and contented customers, instead of
mpovorisiied and discontend rivals of the
other section. I; is time that this subject
, iliould b?* regarded in its true light. The
protective system is neither more nor less
than u war on the exports. 1 again repeat,
if we cannot import, we cannot long export;
and just as wh c?t off or burden the imports,
to the same exient do we, in effect, cut off
and burden the exports. This/have long
seen, and shall now proceed to prove, bv
?
reference to tfie public documents, that my
assertion is sus'ained by facts. The table
of exports shows that during the seven ^
years irom 1624 to 1831, our domestic exs ^
pons remained nearly s:ationnry, notwilh- i
standing the great increase of our population
during that period. Your statute book will
show, that during the same period, the protective
system was irt i s groat vigor. The
first relaxation look place in December.
18*10, under the art of the 20th May. of
the same year, which made a great deduction
in the duties on coffee and tea. f shall
now turn to the table, and give the exports
of domestic articles fot tlioso years, beginning
with 1824:
Here Mr. C. read the following stale*

How rapid the rise just ns the weighs ure
removed ! The increase, since the great
redueton in 1633. has neatly doubled the
average exports,romp; rod with the average
of the s'-ven tariff years preceding 1831,
mid viouid have quite doubled them, had
not the expanded and deranged condition of
the currency, mid the consequent embarrassment
of commerce, pr vented it.
But wf?at.will appear still more extraordinary
o 'I os? who have not reflected on the
operation of the protective system, is the
gr? a: increase ol tee exports of our domesio
rnanufac.urcrs, as the duties go off, fbllowing,
in hat resp'Ct, the same Jaw that
regulates the expor a of the pr at agp'ctiltuai
s'aples. It >s a precious fact, thui speaks
volumes, and which demands the serioti9
eon-i 'eration of the m niufacturing por:ion

actly the reverse of tlie anticipations of he
friends and advocates of protection. So
lar from increasing, under the tariff of 1828,
tile exports of nimutiictured articles actual"
ly dnunished, wh ie they have rapidly increased
just us they have gone off.
Bui the tal>le of exports shall speak for
i self. During the four years under the tariff
of 28, went into operation, the exports
of domestic rnauuftc urc rs gradually declii
ried from $5,729,797. in the year '25, $5,548.334
in me venr '28. From thut time it ^
steadily dec 1 in'd, under the tariff of *28,
each succeeding year showing a falling off
compared with the preceding, till *33, decli

320 in '29. to 85,059,633 in '32, and showing;
an aggregate lulling off*, during the whole
tariff* rcgrime of eight years,from '25 to'32,
of nearly $700,090. At this p. int, we enicrou
ihe reluxu ion of the system, nod
there has heen an onward move, wnh but
Utile vibration, throughout :h'? whole period,
till tli? present time. The last year we
! have is '33 when the exports exceeded nny
preceding year. Tney amounted to 88,
I 397.078, being an increase, during the nix
I cars o! ttie reduction of duties, ol $3,316,445.
against a falling off*, in the preceding
I eight years of protection, of $700,000?an
increase ol' 65 per cnt. in six years, and
this in the midst of all the embarrassment
of commerce, and expansion' nod derangement
of the currency, and, let me add whut
has been so much dreaded by the friends of
manufactures, the mighty increase of the
exports of our great agricultural staples, during
the same per od ; a clear proof that,
under the free trade sys' m, the one does
not interfere with the other. Let no fiiond
of manufacturers suppose that this interest
| mp result is accidental. It is the operation
j of fixed laws, steady, and immutable in their
course, as I shall hereafter show.
Now, sir, I feel myself, with these facts*
warranted iu asserting that if the deranged,
! state of the currency had not in erferred,
l ie great'manufacturing inlerest would have
gone 011 in a flourishing condi.ion during*
the whole period of the reduction under'the
cwn promis act, proving thereby, to the satisfaction
of all, the fall try of the protective
sys'em. Any supposed loss, from the re.
duction of duties, would have been much
moie tiian made up by tho increased ability
of the South and YVesi to consume, nod the
rap dily growing importance of the Cordgn
market.
Out I have not yt done with the system.
It has additional and heavy sins to answer
for. The tariff of *28 is tho source in which
has Originated ;hat very derangement of the
currency, which Has so greatly embarrassed,
at this time, the very interest it was intended
to protect, as well as nil oiher branches of
industry. Uoldasisihe assertion, 1 am
prepared to establish it to thao.her letter.
It lias already been proved that the great
expunsion of the currency in '29, 'SO, and
'31, was lite immediate effect of the tariff of
