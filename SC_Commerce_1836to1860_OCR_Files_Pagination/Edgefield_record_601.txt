compromise which prevailed among its fra
mer-jarring aud-discordanst opinions could
only have ben reconciled by that noble

- amend this whole subject to the considera
tion of Congress. with a single addition
al remark. Certainty and permanency in
any system of governmuetmal policy are, in
all respects, emimently desirable ; but more
particularly is this true in all that elects
-trade and commerce, the operations of
which depend much more on the certainty
of their returns, and calcualatiomns which
embrace distant periods of timte, than etn
high bounties, or duties, which are liable
to constant fiuctuations.
At your late session. I invited your at
tention to the-condition of the currency and
exchanges. and urged the necceity ofadop
uing such measures a. wecrc consistent with
the constitutional comnpceecy of the Gov
ernment, in order to correct the unsound
ness of the one, and as t'tr as practicable
the inequalities of the other. No country
can be in the enjoyment of its full mens
ure of prosperity, without the presence of
a medium of exchange, approximating to
uniformity of value. What ise necessary

-Wheth er this Government, with duo re
gurd to the r'-ghts of the States, has ally
power to constrain the bauks, either to re
sumespecie paymetts, or to force thelm iuto

fail -to claim your cousideration. In :vtW
of the great advantages which are ullowed
the corporators, not among the least or
which is the authority contained in, most of
their charters, to make loans io'three times
the amount of their capital, thereby orten
deriving three times as much interest en
the same amount of money as any indi
vidual is permitted by law to receive, no
sufficient apology can be urged for. a long
continued suspeinsion of specio payments.
Such suspension is producuveof the great
esi detritnents to the public, by 'expelling
from circulation the precious metals, and
seriously hazarding the success of any e
ron that this Government can make. to.in
crease commercial facilities, and to advance
the public interests.
This is the mare to be regretted, and the
indispensable necessity for a sound cur
rency becomes the more manifest, when
we retfect on the vast amount of the inter
nal commerce of the country. Of this we
have an statistics, norjust data for forming
adequato opiions. But there can be no
doubt, but thlait the amount of tronsportion

inland by railroads and canals, and by
itteamurboats aid other modes of conveyance,
over the surface.ofour vast rivers and im
maense lakes, and the value of property car
ried and intercharged by these mean, form
a general aggregate, to which the loreign
commerce of the country. large as it is,
tmakes hut a distant approach.

your action on the suggestleons which I
have felt it to be my duty to submit, to re
lieve the Chief Executive agagistrate by
any and all constitutional means, from a

t$or can I fail to advert, in this connec
tion to the debts which nmany oftheJ States
of the Union have contracted abroad, and
under which they continue to labor. That
indebtedness amounts to a sim not less
than $20,000,000, and whiih has been
retributed to them, for the most part, an
works of internal improvemeet, which are
destined to prove of vast importatnce in ul
tma telv advancing their prosperity and
wealth. Far the debts thud contracted,
the States are alone regponsible. I can
do no more than express the belief thai
each State willfeel itself bound by every
consideration of honor, as well as of inter
est, to meet its engagements with puncttu
ality. The failure, however of any one
State to do so should in no egree inf'ect
the credit of the ret; and the foreign capi
ttalist will have no just cause to experi
ene alarm as toall other State stocks, be
cause any one-or more of the States may
neglect to provide writh punctuality the

EXE~CUT .VE DE~PA WRMENTI, ?
Milledgeville, December 1.,IS811. -
WVithi my message of the 2d ult., I hadl
iihe honor to comnmunicate to you the copy
adf a correspondence wvithi thet Goternmor of
New York, relating to a demnand which I
had made upon himu. for thme arrest and de
livery of Jonhn Greenmatn, a fugitive from
the justice ofrthis State, charged with thme
tenyo an slave. nton the ntlidaait of,
Robert W. Flournoy. A a uperu f
Court-of Chathm- county. heid after, the
makine. of the aflidavit by lr,- Flournoy,
John (4reetau was indicted (' Ihis of
fence by the namo of Alansou (ireetinan..
i nOtne iAuseiic by him,' doubtless to es
cape 'detection. To remove the difficorlty
and scruples of the Gi vernor of New. York,.
in relntion to the sufficiency of the chargo
containled iii the aiffidavit, I renewed the
demand, bnsed upon the indictment, a copy
or which, aithenticated as reqjuired by the
Act of Congress. w7as transativted. You
will perceive, from the correspondence, a
copyQ which is herewith transutitted, that
another pretext has been raised by Gover
nor Sewarl for evnding the performince
fit' hii colstl Ili ionl oligations. Itis pro
tended by him that the hill of indictmtent
is dcl'eive, and he has undertaken the
office 4f counsel for the nccused, by taking
untenable technical cceptions to the pro.
credings, I have answered hiem, as you
will perceive, but I have been long si ce
coaiviniced that it is unnecessary to address
either argu-'ent or reason to hii under
standinge, or to remind hw'. of the necessi
ty of c(cuting. in good faith, according to
the letter nid spirit, the wiset provisions of
tie COinsitutiiou, boy which the States are
eunabled, in riving eliciency to their crint
inal laws. to Inaituain the peace and1l safe
ty of society.
While lie declines complying with my
dumand. on tie ground of a pretended ie
ect in the indictment, ie indicates the in
ientiyn,in nouequivoctl terms. iibould his
olijecions to our judicii proceedings h e
overcome, to sustain his refusal on princi
pics no less unworrantedl by the Constitu
tion, thsat ol'ensive to the peOpI of ihis
State.
There shotl he no longer delny inl set
w!ihng authoritatively the unauner iu which
fitives from justice are to tie delivered,
%% bet they are found in anotherjurisdiction.
CongrCss has tho unqussctionable athority
under the Constitution. to regulato this
mntter,and it is clearly the duty of the Gen -
erndi Government to cause fugitives from
justice, who escape froin the Stte in a hich
the crimi was committed. anid are ound
its anotheir, to lie dclivered up, upon the
demand of the Executive authority of the
State having jurisdiction of the oTeice.
But inasmuch as the mode provided by
Congress, for discharging this high obliga.
tion to the States, so essential to the safety
of society. and liesecurity of propertyhas
proved inlliaeciousi, and as no disposition
is manifested by the Federal Government
to remedy the defect, the subject is of sof
ficient importance to justify a Convention
of the States, to take it into consideratioc.
But we should not defer, for a moment,
the adopiion of measures for our own safe
t y. The regulation heretofore recoumeni
ded by me, would ensure the safety of our
property, and prevent alt interference with
our slave population. Any other consti
tional measure, however, which your wis
dom may suggest, as expedient and prop
er, for the attainment of these desirable
ohject,'shall have my concurrence.
