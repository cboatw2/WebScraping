KXVMINATIO AT KLOKAL COLLKUK.
TheCommittee which was delegated
from ihe Board of Trustee* to attend the
Examination at Floral Collpge, at the
close of the first Session, made a Report
from which the following is an extract:?
The Hrst Class in English Grammar
coosisted of about twenty Students. The
facility with which thes<? corrected faj.se
English, and applied Rules in Parsing,
indica ted close application In, and an
accurate knowledge of their studies. The
second Class, consisting often, are on
resjiectahle standilg, and showed evident
marks of application.
The first Class in Bofarv, equally nil.
rnerous with the first in Craiiiium, did
well. The second also.
A Class in Chemistry acquired much
rrredil.
The examination of a Class in Genme.
try passed off' tolerably well. Had its
mem hers been less agitated. Ihev would
have acquitted themselves better.
The Ciass in Natural Puiiosuphhy de?
serves praise.
The Heading and Spelling Class did
well i i Spelling The Readers progressed
with ease, and were generally correct in
pronunciation; but were deficient in oth. |
sr respects.
The First Class in Arithmetic was J
large, and gave great satisfaction. Toe
Rales were at commune, and applied understand!
ugly.
The Second Class did not perform i
quite so well.
Miss Mary R. McRac, Miss Elizabeth I
Me Eachiii, and Miss Caroline M<*Etrh-1
sri?t constituted the Class in Rhetoric. !
Tuey were prepared as far as the doth ;
page in- Riair's Lectures, and examined ,
in lire ciKvpler on Taste. They were j
highly approved.
A Chfc? was examined ill Grimshaw's
History id' the United Slates, and n?eriled
much praise.
The First Class in Geography was'
highly ciHiuneiulp L The second was |
lot equal to the First. In this branch of
itudvr n little girl, about nine years of
ifagtvcainc forward to !>e examined n/
one. Her name is Marry Ann McKin-'
ion. Questions were wpvd+y propound?d
and a^ promptly answered by the little :
Student. It appeared as if she had made |
he tow of the Earth, and become ac-j
ununited with oterv kindred and tongue!
1 ? c
iiid tM'liofi and people.
The JS|?ectmens in Drawing and Painliny
showed taste and judgnicn-f.
Tire Copy Book." exhibited evident ini- j
Hovernent. Tiie hand-writing wait ehur- i
iclerized by case and regularity. j
The wend day of the Examination ;
.vas now for spent, when the Mu*umI
Class. numbering fifteen. was called up-. ;
Each in bi-r trim played and sang, Miss
VIart ha Crawford and Miss Mary Ann j
b'nirley had made some advances in the
itudy ami practice of Music before fhey ;
:ame to this Institution. Thev still !
odd their supeiioritv. Those who wen*!
ie*t qualified to judge of the proficiency !
nude by the meiubers of (hi" Class, gave |
horn inutii praise. We can not dismiss j
Ills subject, without notice of a display |
nadc together on the Piano, hvtwo morn I
. * t
icrs of this Class, viz: Miss Marv Ann i
darllee of Ciicraw, both equal in size and 1
n age, 12 or 13, whose performance ex iled
much admiration.
Lastly, as if i>v enchantment, all the
Students wore formed into a semi-circle
iround the Piano, arid joined the Iristruc- :
res?; in singing that beautiful little song, |
Home, sweet Home." The sympathy I
if no many silver voices floating on the j
iiellifluous tone* of the Fin no. reached the ;
isteuing ear with thrilling effect. The <
jcrnision whm nn appropriate one. They i
now look leave of each other with lender1
'egret, though the plar.rl sensations of
S'weet Home still plaved m. their cheeks, j
The assemblage of spectators was mi-'
nernus and respectah e. The College i
ilal!, though large, could not contain ;
hern all. They manifest*H a lively in.wrest
in the occurences of the. day, and i
>n the ,'rf?rt of the Indies, the anxiety, was !
ntensc. They were pleased to see the j
Sun of Science shedding its balm v influ;nre
over the land ; feeling that nothing
tould elevate the female character to its!
ireper rank so effectually as this mental ;
Milttirc. 6'tich were the happy result-, j
it the termination of the First Session at i
s !
Unral College. A happy presage of the :
ufuro. whose " coming events cast their,
ilia do wj> before."

otrdinglades. in order to make themselves

die same period the men adopted the '
dan of (duffing their trunk h??se lor the
niiue purpose. A writer of tin? day de. !
icrihes these .stuffed trunk hose as a kind j
?f *!verdi?gale breeches." Tins ridieu- |
lous custom oerasiornillv led the wearers j
into awkward piedicament*. On "tie oc- !
nsion it is related that a young man so
Iressed and distended with bran, while in
run versa! ion with soine. Indies, unforhinntely
tore his hose with a naii ami all
the. bran escaped, leaving him so much
reduced in size as to he scarcely recog. J
nizable. Atone time.a luw whs passed
prohibiting the nmn ngainxt wearing I heir j
breeches stuffed with bays; and a man
having been taken before a justice on >uj?
position of infringing this law established |
his innocence l?y drawing forth the stuffing.
which consisted of a pair of shoots,
, two table cloths, ton napkin*. four shirts,
I a brush, a comb, night caps, and some
i other minor aiticlcs. The ladies, who
I were the first to s<-t the fashion in this
, way, were not a whit behind the gentle
men in the-size to which they distended
! themselves; hut whether the gentlemen
