11MISCELLANEOJS.
From the N. Y. Morning News, 3rd inst.
LETTERS OF MARQUE.
Ti is gen-rally conceded that the only
means by which Mexico, in case she obeys
the cart of certain papers among us. and
declares war, will have as a means of an
noyance, only the right of granting letters
of marque within her power. As she has
no no marine of her own, it becones an
interesting question how far other nations
may plunder us under her authoity. On
this subject, Vattel, book 3d, chap. 15, re
marks as follows:
"There is no doubt but they .private
persons) may with a safe conscience serve
their country by fitting nut by privateers,
unless the war be evidently unjust. But,
on the contrary. foreigners take commis
sions from a prince, to prey on a nation,
absolutely innocent with respect t. them,
are guilty of an infamous practice. The
thirstof gold is their orly inducement, and
however their commission may 'assucre them
impunity, it canaot wash away their exe
crable guilt."
From this it would seem that our South
American friends could legally turn their
enterprise into the Mexican service by ac
cepting commissions. The large English
capitals which are now emplo ed. accord
ing to official information, in furtherance
of the Brazil slave trade, may .e occupied
in the more laudable employment of pirat
ing in Brazilian and Portuguese hands, on
American. comttmerce. The execrable
"guilt" Of the transaction will trouble
them' but little. In relation to the tnove
nents of Mexico, however, it may be well
to recur to the existing treaty with that
country. which, under.date of 1S31, pro
vides as follows:
*.Thirdly, if any of the articles con
tained in the present treaty shall b. viola
teti or infracted in auf manner -. hatever,
it is stipulated that neither of thiecontract
ing parties will order or authorize any
acts of reprisal or declare war againsi the
other. until the party considering itself of
fended, shall have presented the other a
statement of such injuries and damages,
and demanded justice and satisfaction,
and the same shall have heen either r,.
fused or unreasonably delayed."
Article 26, of the sate treaty. provides
that in case of war, six months notice
shall be given to merchants on the coast,
and twelve months to those in the interior.
Those provisions either mean something
or nothing. If they mean anything, the
preliminary steps for a war have not yet
been taken. . What has Mexico done ?
Her minister has protested against our re
cognition of the right of Texas to treat.
and her government issued a manifesto to
the courts of Europe. Now. in March,
1822, the President of the United States
issued a Message, proposing the recogtti
tion of Mexico. The Spanish minister
Joaquin de Aniduaga. made a protest. of
which that of Alrtotte is nearly a copy.
substituting Texas for M-xico. John Q.
Adams, answered the protest, stating
"Under these circumstances, the gov
ernment of the suited States, far from
consuhing the dictates of a policy un
questionable in its morality, yielded to an
obligation of duty. of the highest ore er. by
recognizing a; independent States, nations
which, after deliberately asserting their
rights to that character, have ttaintaiied
antI estatblished it against all resistance
which had been, or could be, brought to
oppose it."
This wvas said in bhhlf of that .Mexico
which now seeks to donmitneer over Texas.
the position of which is stronger thani her's
was. The Spanish Gov ernent then
issued au manile-tuo to the govertnments of
Europe, precisely like that which Mexico
bas lately issued to the same powers. Thle
Spanish protest cotmained the followving
clause:
"'But the governments is fortunately
-know, by a sad experientce, the efl'ects
which ar'e pruduced by a similar overthrow
of principles. They foresee the conse
quence of its proptatation. tnt less fatal to
legitimnate governmevnts.-than in the iteg
rity oif nations, untd 'ire well awvare of the
-consequences to Europe of satnctionitng in
America, as somte pretend, the undefined
right of insurrectton."
All tinis gasemniade ended in the recogni
lion of Mextwo.. Trhe rulers of Mexico
are niow, true Cu their parentage, playing
ofi t he samte vapors upon .the United
States. Is it not a little curious that ini
this aige of the world, a few renegade
-Spaniards, half~castes, and Indians, should
lie claiming authority over ant independent
Atnglo Saxon na'in ? For a pretended
wrong they claim to let loose the plunder
ers of all natioins upIon our commerce.
God foibid the occurrance of sucht att un
happy necessity; but if Mexico should
rush madly anid wrongfully upon such a
resort of war, humanity and policy Miil
combine in imposing 00 our govetrnment
the duty of crashing it at otnce in the bud,
by a force against wvhich resisitnce should
not even'be attempted.
SAWV MILLS.
As a means of dispensing with the weight
of the sawgate in sawmilk, which is con
sidered obijectiontable, tae saw hans been
attached to a sliditng balock am top and hot
tom, a'ed ther.-fore depending upon its stiti'
ness, instead of te tension given to it by
screws whe'n applied in a gate. To cent
bine the advantages of bioth .methods, a
patet~ has been granted for "straitnitng"
the saw, (as it is termed in technical lan
guage,) itmout the use of a gate, by at
taebing a piston to each side; the two pis
tons workingi ini appropriate cyliuders con
oected together by a steam pipe, so as to
use the elastic force of steam to strain the
sa*. The elastic force of the steatu does
not imipede the mtotiomn, as it is equal on
both ptistons, atnd therefore balatnced.
The hitliculty of tmatking circular saws
of sulficient diamteter to cut throug't large
logs was attempted to be remedied some
years ago, by using two saws, one above
mhe~othter, each-cutintg halfway through the
Jog., As to an alleged imprviement on
this, a patent has been granted for several
saws, above and below , each succeeding
one beinig of greater diatugeter, so as to
make the entire cut by a series of' cuts, in
stead of a single or double otne.
Several patents have been granted for
various modes or ff augin the had nd
tail of blocks of sawmills, to render them
self setting. The great variety of devices
for this purpose, which have been patented
and are in public use, is matter of astonish.
men!, and is evidence of the great resour
ces of mechanical ingenui;y. Some of
those patented during the past year are
for connecting the slides of the head and
tail blocks, on which the log rests, as to
move both ends of the log by the same op
eration, and vet enable the two blocks to
be moved ne'arer to, or farther front each
other, for logs of different lengths; oth
ers, for arrangements of parts for lifting the
log vertically, that the slides, on which it
rests during the whole operation, may be
moved the required distance on a set of
inclined planes so located and arranged
that, when the log is agaip perry itted to
rebt on them, its weight will cause the
whole to slide the required distance for the
thicknes. of a plank. And again. others
are for modes of setting the tail end of the
log by a slow gradual motion. (the length
of the log admitting of this;) and the head
end by liberating it weight connected with
a lever and auxiliary patts. by which the
desired effect is produced the moment the
sow runs out of the log. These are the
ereralcharacteiistics; but the other ar
augements.covered by other patents,could
not be made clear without drawings.

INVALUABLE
Family Medicines,
"Prove all things, and hold jast to that
which is goo'd."-Paul.
1 I H ESE Pills are no longer among those
of doubtful utility. They have passed
away from the thousands daily lanached on
the --tide of experiment," and now stand higher
in-reputation, and are becoming more exten
sively nsed ttan any other medicine ever pre
pared. They have been introdtced into every
place where it has been lound possible to carry
them, and there are few towns, or villages,
but contain some remarkable evidences of
their good effects. But it is not necessary to
advertise tltctn at large,. or to say any thing
further of them, than to 13'cantion those wish
ing to purchase Antibillious Family Medicine,
to be particular to enquire for SPENCEtt'S
VEGETABLE PILLS. as there are notner
uos preparations put on sale almost every day,
of doubtful efficacy. To satisfy the world of
the inestimable worth of this Medicine, I
would simply observe that, it has been long
used by some of the lending lights of the pro
fession in their extensive practice, and is now
prepared with great care, and upon scientific
and chemical principles,'for general use, by
thepresetnt proprietor ONLY. The amputation
of Quackery therefore cannot be affixed to this
Medicine, since it is the preparatwn of regudar
practising Physicians, who have made the healing
art their profession, and whose pharmacentie
preparations will ever be held in the highest esti
matron.

SICKLY SEASON!
T HERE is not a man, woman, or child,

many causes existing at one period as there are
now, so likely to produce a state of sickness.
The repeated changes in the atmosphere. by
acting as they do upon the constitu'.inn, and
quality of blood itself, give occasion for the
most fatal and malignant disorders. The bile

evacuated in twenty-four hours. There are
nmany causes which produce unhealthy blood ;

Tooth-ache: Tooth-ache!!
D R. LACOUNT'S ELIXIR is a speedy,
certain, and lasting cure for the most
painful and distressing disease that can affect
the human frame. In almost all cases of
Tooth ache it arises from a decayed state of
Wpe parts, which exposes to the action of the
atmospherit air, the nerve, or internal surface
of the copious or rotten tooth, and a cure must
be effected. either by extraction or by render
ng those parts imperious to the action of the
air.
Dr. Lacount's Elixir is particularly adapted
to destroy the nerve, without the slightest in
jury to the other teeth, and thereby effect a
permanent cure. Its application is not at
