.i'j The lest art in the drama of the 1 ve*
of great men la possessed of more than
ordinary interest. That of Napoleon we
,.hnve hever seen alluded to, except so far
as tti describe his lost moments, without
nay reference to-his views of the futur*'.
? We find in Campbell's Foreign Monthly
Magazine, a short article from the (Br.)
1 ' Evangelical Magazine, which contains
many interesting observations of the ma.
kcr of Empires on religious subjects. The
article concludes aa follows :
14ft may even be said that he 'confer !
- add Christ before men.' In a familiar but
solemn conversation ho exclaimed, with
i the oxpressive accent and r~ph?tic brevity
which had an electric effect, I know
men ; and I tell you that Jesus was not a
man. His religion is a self-existent mystoffy
j and it proceeds from a mind not
human. There is in it a deep peculiarity
of chnraeter which has produced a succession
of doctrines and maxims till then un
known. Jesus borrowed nothing from
human knowledge. Only i:i himself fa
found completely the example or the imitation
of his life. Neither was he a phi*
4 losopher; for his proofs wcro miracles
and his desciples from the very first a*
dored him. In fact, science and philosophy
are powerless to salvation; atid the
sole object of Jesus, in coming into the
world, was to unveil tho mysteries of
heaven and tho laws of mind. Alexander,
Cesar, Charlemagne, and I, have
founded empires; but on what have we
rested the creations of our genius ? Upon
force. ^)nly Jesus has founded nn empire
upon love; and, at this moment,
millions of men would die for him. It
was not a day or a battle that won the
Victory over the world for tho Christian
religion? No; it was a long war, a fight
of three centuries, begun hy the apostles, I
and cnneliifinrl hv thnir atireniisnia. nnil
? "J ------ ? ?I ?
the flow of (he Christian generations that
followed. In that war all tho kings and
powers of the earth on one side; on the
other side I see no army, but a mysterious
force, and a few men scattered here and
there through all parts of the world, and
who had no rallying point but their faith
in the mysteries of tho cross. I die be.
fore my time, and my body will ho put in
the ground to become the food of worms.'
Such is the fate of the great Napoleon!
What an abyss between my deep wrechednessand
Christ's eternal kingdom, pro.
claimed, loved, adored, and spreading
through the world! Was that dying?
waa it not rather to five ? The death of
Christ is the death of God.'
M With these words Napoleon coascd;
but General Bcrtrand making no roply,
he added 'If you do not understand that
Jesus Christ is God, I have been wrong
in calling you General,"'
DABBY AND TUB BAH.
< Twat one of thoso days when the sun
in its perpendicular altitudo looks at two
aides of the hedge at once?-a lovely mid.
summer day?when nature was laughing
till kef sides ached, and mother earth, in
her gayeat mood, was lavishing her prom,
ises and her umiles to her often ungrate,
ful children, the lambs were skipping to
and fro in their enclosed pastures, and the
cows, with grave and matron aspoctr,
were lolling in the sun, and ruminating
their already gathered repast?every.
thing teemed happy except the shepherd
Darby.
Poor fellow! "A green nnd yellow
melancholy." had settled on his family
cheek; hit grief ho revealed not, bullet
"concealment, like a worm i' the bud,"
pray upon hit spirits; he stalked about
the held liko a ghost, or leaned upon his
crook in silent despair.
Lord Ampleficld and Squire Buckthorn
were riding pnst to dinner.
"I wonder," said his lordship to the
quire "what can be the matter with my
hephcrd Darby. lie seems in n galloping
consumption, and were I to lose him
1 would not see his like again for many
a long day. He is the most honest, steady,
careful crraturo in the world, and
never told a lie in his life."
"Good I Why my lord do you really
believe such nonsense?"
"Decidedly I do. I know your opinion
ie not very favorable as to tho moral character
of our dependents, yet there ure
some among them not unworthy of trust."
They now advanced nearer, and his
lordship held up his whip as a signal, and
over bounded Darby. "Well, Darby,
that shower wo had last night served the
pastures."
" It did my lord, and the cows will give
a larger menl, and require milking earlier
this ?vsninor. through m?.n. ?fi. ?
" Darby, bring over iny favorite ram,
that thia gentleman may s?e it."
Yea, my lord, Hallo, Sweeper, away
for Baltface."
In a few minutes the dog hunted tho
ram up from the flock. That's a clever
turn iny worthy, aaid the squiro; there's
half a crown to drink."
Thanks to yoor honor," said Darby,
but the worth of that in strong drink
will serve me a year, and yet I'll spend it
in drink all on one night."
^Explain this riddle Dorhy."
* WhV. sir. when I feel inv??.lf mnrrtf
V "V ' J
enough without it, whore a the uac in (r.
king it? Th?t stream can alack my
t&irat aa wcill. Yot I'll not apeak for others
-?many a one there ore, who must hnro
strong drink to give them faUe spirits,
on them will I spend it to open their
hearta, and make them forget their day's
toil.
You arc n worthy fellow, nnd n philosopher,
said Lord Amplefield, with a look
of triumph aa ho nnd the squire rode off.
Whataay you to my shepherd now?"
MA mighty plausible follow, indeed! Yet
proud aa you are of hiin, my lord, I'll bet a
SfO#c of sheepthit before two d.ivs I make
him led yoti .t bare fated lie, out anJout."
~ pi| i n in inn
"Done!" said hi* lordship, and tho squiro
set out on-hie its-making expedition.
He eoon ascertained the cause of Darby's
melancholly. There had been a quarrel hetwi
en him and the girl of bis heart, the lovely
Caulhleen. Pride prevented a reconciliation, >
though both would have given the world to be
in each other's arms. To her the Squire bent
Ids steps, succeeded in drawing out the secret i
that she loved Darby with a heart and a half,
and then artfully upbrading her unkindness
in neglecting the " worthy young fellow," who
was dying for her, contrived to inveigtoher,
by a scries of falsehoods, into a plan to get
reconsiled to Darby, and while in tho height
of his happiness, to coax the rani from htm.
It succeeded next to admiration, and tho
hiughing girl tripped home, leading the animat
with a kerchief taken from her snowy
bosom.
Darby was left now to his solitary reflections.
Tho hour was rapidly approaching when his
lordship usually took his round, and he would
infallibly miss his favourite ram. What was
to bo done1 To tell a LIE appeared to his
honest mind the very essence of degradation
?to equivocate wav meanness execrable?
yet an excuse must be had I A sudden thought
sci/.ed him?ho resolved to see how a lie
would look before he told it; and planted his
crook in the field, and placing h?s hat on it, in
order to personate himself, he retired a short
distance and in tho character of his lordship,
hailed the cfligy as follows:
"Good morrow, Darby."
"Good morrow, my lord."
"How arc the flocks today, Darby."
"Pretty fair, my lord."
"Darby, I don't ace my favorite ram?where
is he 1"
'Oh, my lord, he - he ho"
'He what, Darby 1"
"lie was droWnd-ed?my?tny lord."
"D-irby if I did not know your general character
for carefulness, I should feel exceedingly
annoyed, but I presume it was an accident.
Send iho fat and hide up to the castle."
'That won't do I" murmured Darby, slowly
turning away. Unresolved to try again.
' Good morrow, Darby."
"Good morrow, my lord."
"Are the flocks well to day, Darby."
Bravely, rny lord."
And my ram Darby, whero is he."
'My Lord, he he? "
Is there any thing wrong? tell mcatoncc."
He was sto-len,my lord."
"Stolen ! stolen ! I saw him this morning as
I was riding past. When was he 6tolen 1"
"That won't do either," exclaimed the poor
shepherd, as he turned away the second time.
?Cruel, cruel Cauih !"
Something whispered to him, ' Try if perhaps
tho TRUTH will do?" Fresh courage
seemed to animate his desponding mind, and
wheeling about, he commenced the colloquy,
i and coming to the usual interrogation "where's
the ram," he dropped on his knees and exclaimed,
"Oh! my lord. 1 had a falling out
with my sweetheart, and she would not make
it up with me unless I made her a present of
your lordships favourite ram. Discharge me
my lord ; do with me what you please, but I
could not bring myself to tell vuur lordship a
LIE!"
"That w II do!" shouted Darby, springing
from his knees, and walking up and down
with a feeling of honest exultation. He had
scarcely time to compose himself when his
lordship and the squire appeared. Darby on
the usual interrogation being put, dropped on
his knees, and told "the truth and nothing but
thi truth," and instead of seeing a frown
f gather on his lordships coantenance, he behold
him turn with a look of triumph towards tho
squire whilo he exclaimed.
'An honest man's the noblest work of God."
The ladies are informed, in conclusion, that
the squire's forfeited sheep were given to
Cauthlcen as a dower, and in taking the hand
of her shepherd, she promised never again to
j put his truth and constancy to so severe a
j trial.
I WASTS IN A BALL ROOM.
j On Tuesday evening the 20lh ult. aa two
! young men who had been taking a wasps' nest,
| were returning to Chesterfield, on approachj
inj the town they were attracted to a house
by the sounds of music and rejoicing, it prov*
! od to be a dwelling where festivities in celebraI
tion of a marriage was taking placo ; and,
i claiming some acquaintance with the inmates
the young incn joined the festive throng. The
wasps' nest, which was folded in a handker- \
chief, was placed in a corner of the room, un- I
known to the company, and the dance pro. !
cecded. After a time, the two young men
alluded to, took their departure, leaving
(whether intentionally or not, docs not appear)
tho nest in tho room. The dance continued,
when lo! one of the females made an equivocal
sort of movement, &nd a precipitate retreat
| from the house, her husband following close
I at her heels, anxious to learn the cause of his
wife's extraordinary conduct. Scarcely had
I the party left the house, when a second and
I a third, and a fourth of the female guests,
I exhibited similar equivocal symptoms, follow.
: ed by suppressed shrieks and bewildered
looks The male members of the company
looked anxiously and enquiringly at the ladies,
who in return skipped about the room with
wonderful agility, giving sundry indications
that their mysterious movements could not be
satisfactorily explained. Suddenly tho men
became afflicted, thaugli not exactly after the
: game fashion as (ho ladies, and a very exciting,
but at the same liino very comical scene
ensued, to attempt to depict which would bo
a hopeless task: it may bo imagined, but
certainly cannot be described. The cause of
this derangement of the festive circlo was,
| however, soon apparent. The fidler, who j
I was sightless, feeling something very sharp
enter his cheek, dropped his instrument, and
{ applied his hands with great force to his face,
bringing to the earth one of the monsters that
had been a source of annoyance. Suffice it
to say, somo of the wasps had escaped from
confinement, and in revenge for the punish*
merit that they had endured, crept up the legs
of the dancers, and inflicted their sling. As
many as three and four watfs were found
i upon one of the females.? Derbyshire Chron.

T1VE ACADEMY BUILDINGS.
THE Chcraw Ac identical Society is now in
debt about $1600. Since its establishment
has expended, for lots, buildings, and rrpaifs,
about $5000; besides lame sums of monev in
making up to teachers from time to time deficiencies
in their salaries, arising from inade.
quale receipts for tuition. Though tie
Society lias heretofore received considerable
aid from citizens and others not members ; yet
the principal burden and the whole responsi.
bility (previous to last year) has always rested
on those who tcere. The Society now
ronsists of few in number ; and at a meeting
convened this day, it was resolved to sell the
Academical lx>ts and Buildings for the purpose
of paying the above debt; unless some
measures aro promptly adopted by the community
to discharge the name. Most, perhaps
all, the members of the Society are understood
to be willing to co-operate with their fellow
citizens in this matter; but they are not disposed
to do it without their assistance.
The 10th day of next month is fivnd for I
dclerming upon the calo ; unless, before that
date, the people (with gucIi argumcntb an satisfy
creditors) put their veto upon it.
