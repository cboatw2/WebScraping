The fouse having nothing else to do
are about to take some lessons on the sci

mPembers, particularly Mr. Adams. that lie
can learn evrr one to tell a fortnight be

It is thought that the science may be
available to politicians as well as to Davi
gmlors, farmers, &c.
h'lae Committee to which the subject waI
referred, reported at Resolmion granting the
use of th lIall of Represenatives to Mr
Espy, fir the purpose of delivering Lee
tureb to the Members in support of his thee
ries. Soeio opposition was made to thle
propostlioln.
.5i r. Pienoats suggested that, in this IIouse,
it was quite nnecessary to resort to a pub

The I iouse. however, sustained the Reso

The Scule took uip the Bill to proven
the issuing nad circulation of the notes o
aite Bank of tle United States, as currency
and the debate was continued through thc

Mr. Wall saicl the present Bank clam

'Thle new Bank fiiud amongst other proper

Banak was not legally bound to redeena

but that warnot a riatter for our considera

was to create legal rights and remedies.

given existence to the Corporation, ant

Mr. Preston doubted the power of Con

THE REPORT ON TIE DUEL.
Mr. Toucey, of Connecticut, Chairman
of the Select Committee of Investigation
on the late Duel, obtained leave to make a
Report.
The Report was not read; but it recom
mends,
1st, Tihe expulsion of 51r. Graves, for a
breach of the rights and lprivileges of tihe
House, and an oll'encc of a high character
against the vital principle of a deliberative
assembly and of represenututive governament
2d, Trhat Messrs. Jones and Wise, as
seconds, deserve the severe censtre of the
House. The Committee dwell on Mr.
Wise's conduct as particularly censurable
in resisting any accommodation without
death.
3d, The Committee entertain no doubt
that J. W. Vcbb lhas been guilty ora breach
of privilege of tihe House, but as he is amen
able to the civil authority for a conspiracy
to assassinate, they recommend that the
House bestow on him no furtier notice.
This Report was made by four members
Messrs. Grenuell and Iaridon made a sepa
rate Report. Air. Elmore made a Iteport
distinct froi the other two. The Commit
tee moved the printing of tihe papers and
the postponement of the RIeport till Alon

Ahan those of New York. In a free conver

of the New York banks, during the year
past, had in a measure closed New York
against them as a market, the opposite poli

pened those cities as markets for their man

The proposition that has been adopted.

BUFFALO JOURNAL OFFICE,
Saturday. 6 Pl. M.
Dear Sir-I have before the mail closes,
an opportui y to convey to you the latest
news from Ioronto. The cars have just
arrived from the Falls, and from Jacob Sei
bold 1 learn that he saw the execution of
Lount and Mathews, at that place, on the
morning of the 12th inst., at 8o'clock.
Petitions had been sent to Gov. Arthur
for mercy, or even an extension, signed by
some three thousand citizens of Toronto
and its vicinity; the Executive Council had
been called together, but naught availed to
stay the execution. The bodies notwith
standing the earnest application of their
wives atid friends, were delivered up for
dissection.
4 need not tell you that it has created a
new a strong excitement.
Seihold states that four-Theller, Mont
gomery, Anderson, and - , are to be ex
ectted on the 30th; and seven at Hamilton
on the 24th.
The British Colonist declares that it has
good authority f1or saying that Sutherland
has made no disclosures whatever.
PENSACOLA. A pril 14.
Important from Mevico.-The Ui. States
ship Natchez arrived here on Monday trar
ning last from Vera Cruz. The Natchez
arrived at Vera Cruz the same day on
which the Vandalia sailed. The French
squadron consisting of one frigate and five
brigs of war, were then lying at Sacrificio.
Four of the brigs sailed two or three days
after. The French minister was on board
the frigate, corresponding wit h the 'Su
preie Government,' and had given the
Mexicans until the 15th of present month to
decide upon and pay the indemnity demand
ed by the Freneli, which has now been re
duced by them to about 1800,000. This
sum, it was supposed the Mexican Govern
mnent would pay, but it was rumored and
generally believed that the govornment
would at once pass a law, banishing all
French subjects froi the republic. In this
way, by means of confiscations, &c. it was
supposed the sum required would be raised.

NOBLE CONDUCT 1OF AN AMERIICAN '
UAPTAIN.
11er Majesty's Ship llercules,
llalifax liarbor. March 28, 1838.
Mr. hlowe, Sir-Mtay I beg te favourof
yourl giving isertion to the followitg state
ment:
On otir passage f.'om England to this
port, when in Iatittude 42 N. and longitude
42 WV. we observed a sail haul tup for uts,
apparently with the desire of speaking tis
ship. 1 immediately closed with her, and
fthund it to he the American, ship "Comn
umerce," of and from Charleston, bound to
Liverpool, commnanided by Capt. Perry,
and that his object in communicating wvith
us, 'was, to beg that we would receive on
heard part of the crew of the Elizabeth
Caroline, of St. Stephen's, New Bruns
wick, which vessel lie had met dismnasted
anid waterlogged, Ja latitude 39 N. and.
lotngitude 45 WV. and hail taken all the crew
ofl the wreck six (lays previously.
Trhese unforttunate persons had beetn 23
days (in the f'orecastle of the vessel lashed
to the windlass, exposed to every sea, with
barely snflicient food to sutstaini life, atnd all
the water they hatd remaining was but twvo
gaillotns, wvhen the Commerce full in with
her.
My motive in detailing to you these par
tieunia, is principally to express miy ad mi
ration. andl that of aell those under mny comn
mnamil, at the generous andi humane conduct
of Captain Perry, as it has' been mnado
kntownm to us by the men belonging to tho
lElizabeth Caroline.
It a plears itat the Commerce fell in wvith
this w'reck by the merest chance, at about
half past nine at night. on the 4th March;
tandl thiat on hearing the cries of the crew,
the "Comtmerce" instantly shortened sail,
wore ro)und, and wvent close alongside of
the waterlogged vessel-Capt. Perry hail
ing thenm in these cheering words, as the
men have themselves represented: "Keep
tip your hi'arts, boys, there is too tmuchi sea
to board yotu now, butt I will never leave
yott till I take yotu oil';" anti thro' the night
le twiee or thrice passed round them, re
peating those consoling 'words, and offering
to veer to them water and pirovisionis if they
wvere in immecdiatte want of either.
These generotus assurances this bravo
sailor rigidly fulfilled, and after piersevering
ly keeping close to the vessel for two nights
aend a day, blowing very huard all the time,
he at hetngth succeeded in getting the people
aell otut oif her into tihe Commerce, whe're ho
clothed them, and treated thmeim with a kind- -
ness whbich, as they grateftully say, they
never can forget, or 'will ease to acknow
ledge.
I have the honotir tue be, sir, your v'ery obe
dient servat.
