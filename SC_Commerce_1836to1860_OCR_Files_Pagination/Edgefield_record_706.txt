it our duty to make public The following f

which we have reipeatedly used %% ith cou d

wheat flour to about the consistency of t
thick cream, ani drink it. This is tu e .
repeated sevei-al times in the course of r
the day, or as often as you are thir 'y;r
and it is not very likely you will need to V

only ased it in our case, but we have re- C
