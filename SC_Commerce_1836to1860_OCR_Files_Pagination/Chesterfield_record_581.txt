VERMONT.
From the Message of Governor Paine, of
Vermont to the Legislature of that State,
now in session, we copy the following paragraphs,
relating to the institutions and politics
of the Un on :
"The attention of the people of the whole
Union his been directed, by events which
have occurred within the hist few yea-s, to
certain amendments which are deemed es.>*cniial
in the Federal Constitution. The undue
stimulus to ambition which is though? to be
supplied by the prospect of the Presidential j
offie being enjoyed by its occupant (or a sec- j
ond tern, of four years, has created great j
alinn tortiie balance of trie powers of the
General Government. Experience lias certainly
proved that if there is anv danger of
that oalatice being destroyed, H arises from
the constant eiiorts c:f the Execu ive departni
>nt looxtcn I its patronage and power. '
That such eiforts huve frequently been '
made to enable the President to secure ?. j
re-election, can hardly he doubted ; and j
it is to i>e feared that tiiev will continue
to he too often made, so long as human '
/ O
nature remains uriohangeu.
I
" V general complaint, arising from the ;
same well-grounded apprehension, exists !
as to the President's power of removal
from oiiice. The Constitution directly '
gives him no such power, but he has been j
allowed to take it by implication, It is
difficult to imagine how it should ever
have been derived from that provision in
the Constitution which authorizes hiin
to nominate, "and by and with the ad
vice and consent of the Senate to appoint" I
all oiiicers.
Too President and Senate are jc.inrly |
made tlie appointing power, and,/in the j

subject, one would have supposed they f

But the President claims to exercise it j
alone, and more frequently exercises it j
without any cause, except for the politi- j
cal opinions of those removed, than from
an impartial regard to the faithful per i
lormence of the public service, which ,
forms the sole argument in favor of its
existence. F??r if tiie Constitution tie- |
signed to give sucli a power to the Prosi- ;
deal, it must have h;nn for the purpose!
of enabling him to make removals requi,- j,

perverted to a totally d tf rent purpose? ;
that of enabling him to reward his sup- j
purlers, strengthen his infiaunco, and j?e- J
cure his own re-election.

A letter has been received from Leip- .
zig, dated 23d July, stating that Mr. Lewis
Gabriel Stockner, a mechanician of
that city, has just finished an Electro
Magnetic Locomotive, the greatest part
of which is constructed after Mr. Wag.
ner's plan, and which has been purchased
by the Germanic Diet. This locomotive
is of seven horse power, and will draw
three cars full of passenger*. It coot*
about $1,000, instead of $7,5o0, the cost
of a common steam locomotive; the sop*
ply for it amounts to not more than 60
cents per day.
The experiments which hnve been
made with Mr. Stock.er's locomotive on
the railroad between Leipzig and Dresden
left nothing to be d?*ired.

John W. Stevens was lecently tried in
Winchester, Va. for robbing the mail. It
was shown in evidence that this man
was suspected. To detect hi in in the
act, letters containing money were deposited
in the mail, which were to be
withdrawn if he did not purloin them.?
fie took them from the office, abstracted
the monev and the letters were found in
his possession. Yet the Judge charged
the Jury that the letters were fictitious,
and the robber teas acquitted!
Last week a body of Murtnsns, numbering
about seventy individual.*, passed through
Montreal on their way to Nauvoo. Illinois, to
join their fellow fanatics in that settlement.
They were from Gloucester, England, and
arrived at Quebec in the Collins. They ap?
pear to be quiet, inoffensive people, and possessed
of some means. They call themselves
the "ljatfei Day Saints," or Mormons, from
having adopted the book of Mormon as a part
of divine revelation. They believe in the
in the efficacy of prayer as a means of curing
all diseases. One of their children, when at
the immigrant sheds, was seized with toothrtch,
and two of them laying their hand* on
her head, prayed that the Almighty would be
pleased to releive her. We do not know
whether the deluded creatures had their delusion
strengthened or weakened by the ? ?
