Dear Sir:?
Notwithstanding the nonsensicaj rant in the
American papers, concerning this country, and
the expeditions destined to operate against the
Texians, you should know that the Mexicans
and their Government are resolved to make
Texas t-nter into its duty, and they will do so. j
Every tiling is now ready for the march of the |
troops, which are composed of 600 infantry,
ane 1200 cavalry, with the icorresdiug artillery-;
and the command is confided to Gen. Rus- J
lamente, well known for his valor and patrio-!
tisn". j
Although; with great trouble, there have
been equipped three brigs, six schooner?, ana

Jamaica two good steam boats, and 1 brig, un?

der the command of U'm. McKenzie, who

As soon as these vessels arrive, about 1000

land, to unite with them, under the command
of Bustamente*
And believe &c.

P. S. The arrival of Santa Ana will not
change in the least degree, the aspect of the

that the expedition will start about the

ings wliicrii will accrue from it to the coun. | ni

subscribing to its stock ourselves, but by | tj'

do the same. J];

REASONS j T
Of ex-P resident Jackson for not acting dcfi. | foi
ni lively on a bill entitled "An act desig- j of
iiuling and limiting I lie J units receivable , lu
for the revenues of the United Statesjre
Tiie bill from the Senate, entitled " An ! st;
act designating and limiting tho funds re-: es
ceivable for the revenues of the U. States," ' ar
came to my hands yesterday at 2 o'clock, j U:
| P. M. On perusing it, I found its provis- j
ions so complex and uncertain, that I deem- \
j cd it necessary to obtain the opinion of the i tC]
j Attorney General of the United States on j t0
several important questions touching its con- Mi
struction and effect, before 1 could decide i let
on the disposition to be made of it. The <
Attorney General took up the subject im- j a '
* rr>'
mediately, and his reply was reported to me j '
this day at 5, P. M. As this officer, after
a careful and laborious examination of the
j bill, and a distinct expression of his opinion
' on the points proposed to him, still came J S.
j to the conclusion that the construction of! tin
I the bill, should it become a law, would be a 1
I yet a subject of much perplexity and doubt,; gu
j (a view of the bill entirely coincident with i be
j my own.) and as I cannot think it proper,j
; in a matter of such vita! interest and of such fei
constant application, to approve a bill so , ar
j liable to a diversity of interpretations, and sa
! more especially as 1 have not had time, J th?
: amid the duties constantly pressing on me,; rd:
I to give the subject that deliberate conside- I S.
J ration which its importance demands, I am ! Ti
! constrained to retain the hill, without act- ; iej
! ing definitively thereon ; and to the end that: H
my reasons for this step may be fully un. ; foi
derstood, I sIkiII cause this paper, with the ! Ca
opinion of the Attorney General, and the wt
bill in question, to be deposited in the Do- tlx
I partni'T.t of State.

, and property. They are to have all the adi

On Saturday night the 11th inst. a party of
] Indians made an attack on Mr. David Lang's
| house, on the South prong of St. Majy's riv? r.
! about thirty miles from this place, and killed
Mr. John A. Osteon, while sitting at supper.
' The Indians then made a rush upon the house,
! which was checked by Mr. Lang's son, quite
| a lad, shooting one of the Indians entering the
! door. The family of Mr. Lang immediately
closed the doors of the house, which the Indians
attempted to force open, but failing, they
i retired, taking off Mr. Osteen's horse. They
caught and scalped a young negro, but he foN
j tunately will, it is thought, survive the wound.
I African Discoveries.?The Asiatic Journal
j for January contains some account of the exj
ploring expedition recently undertaken by Dr.
Smith and others, from Cape Town, South
Africa, into the interior of the continent. It
appears that the expedition penetrated almost
as far as the tropic, found a very healthy
; climate, and returned in excellent condition,
j with an immense variety of drawings, and
Krwimons of natural historv. The artist who
I -rvw - J
j furnishes the zoological part of the collection
, is said to have set out on this hazardous ad!
venture in a state of health which hardly allowed
a hope of his being able to reach the
frontier of the colony, and to have returned a
; strong, robust, and healthy man. In the
j words of Sir John Herschell, he was "a living
| and thriving proof of the salubrity of the
country traversed."
This is an important fact in reference to
African Colonization. And yet Colonizationists
are charged with inhumanity in wishing
i to remove so many of our free colored people
j as are disposed to emigrate from a country
! where they scarcely increase at all, and from
cities where one in every twenty-seven of
j them dies annually, to the fine healthy counI
tries in the land of their fathers.
