THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE, g
Fellow Citizens.?You have been as- a

was so lately called by the direct enf. y

of the important functions of their a
chief executive office. Upon the cxpira- s
tion of a single montli from the day of a
his installation, he has paid the great ti
debt of nature, leaving behind him a name ! >1
associated with the recollection of nu-1 s
merous benefits conferred upon the coun- f(
try during a long life of patriotic devo- tl
tion. With this public bereavement are h
connected other considerations which fi
will not escape the attention of Congress, c
The preparations necessary for his retno- o
ral to the seat of Government in view of b
* residence of four years must have de- \\
Yolved upon the late President heavy ex- tl
penditurcs, which, if permitted to bur- ei
den the limited resources of his private u
fortune, may tend the embarrassment of h
hissurving family; and it is therefore res- el
pectfully submitted to Congress whether
the ordinary principles of justice would ol
. not dictate the propriety of its legislative fc
interposition. By the-provisions of the in
fundamental law, the powers and duties at
' of the high station to which he was ele- re
aled have devolved npon me, and in the cr
dispositions of the representatives of the m
' States and of the people will be found, T
to a great extent, a solution of the pro- ag
hlem to which our institutions are for the cs
first time subjected. va
In entering upon the duties of this al
office, I did not feel that it would be be- on
coming in me to disturb what had been tic
ordered by my lamented predecessor.? w<
Whatever therefore may have been my thi
opinion, originally, as to the propriety of
"Of convening Congress at so early a day ag
from that of its late adjournment, I found pc
n new and a controlling inducement not lai
to interfere with the putriotic desires of G<
the late President, in the novelty of the fit
situation in which I was so unexpectedly an
placed. My first wish under such cir- lie
cnmstances would necessarily have called sui
to my aid in the administration of public ed
affairs the combined wisdom of the two po
Houses of Congress, in order to takeltr)
their counsel and advices as to the best po
mode of extricating the Government and pu
the country from the embarrassments cuj
weighing heavily on both. I am the most pu
happy in finding myself so soon after my tio
accession to the Presidency surrounded lov
by the immediate Representatives of ihe en;
Slates and People. L&m
No important changes having taken we
place in our foreign relations since the fall
" last session of Congress, it is not deem- clii
ed necessary on this occasion to go into of
a detailed statement in regard to them, arc
I am happy to say that I see nothing to in I
destroy the hope of being able to pre- int
serve peace. # # * * is i

Jancc in the Treasury on the fourth (lav pr<

is estimated at 8S6O.OGO. This includes lie
the sum of $215,000 deposited in the ag
Mint and its branches to procure metal ye
for coining and in process of coinage, ce
and which could not be withdrawn with* th
out inconvenience, thus leaving subject an
to diaft in the various depositories the in
sum of $615,000. B>' virtue of two se- OC
vernl acts of Congress, the Secretary of

tg the just expectations of the country, ini
rowing out of pre-existing laws. The as
ct of 2d March, 1833, commonly called ca
>e compromise act, should not be alter- se
(1 except under urgent necessities, which di
re not believed at this time to exist. One co
ear only remains to complete the series ni
f reductions provided for by that law, in
t which time provisions made by the wl
ame law, and which then will be brought H
ctirely in aid of the manufacturing in- de
erests of the Union, will not fail to pro- vc
ucc the most beneficial results. Under a ed
vstein of discriminating duties imposed th
,ir purposes of revenue, in unsion with th
lie provisions of existing laws, it is to be vr
oped ihat our policy will, in future, be ur
xed and permanent, so as to avoid those to
onstant fluctuations which defeat the very ar
bjects they have in view. We shall thus br
est maintain a position which, while it th
'ill enable us the more readily to meet ly
lendvances of other countries calcnlat- se
d to promote our trade "and commerce, te
ill at the same time leave in our own lr
anils the means of retailing with greater pi

In intimate connection with the question fo
" revenue is that which makes provision th
ir a suitable fiscal fagent capable of add- in;
g increased faciliti6s in the collection sti
id disbursement of the public revenues, di<
nderinj: more secure their custodv, and m<
insulting the true economy, in the great, w?
ultiplied and delicate operations of the mi
reasury Dfipartment. Upon such an do
[ent depends in an eminent degree the wi
tablishment of a currency of uniform co
lue, which is of so great importance to ca
I the essential interests of society; and sh
i the wisdom to be manifested in its crea- vo
in much depends. So intimately inter- sii
>ven are its operations, not only with scl
e interests of individuals, but with those ve
the Stales, that it rnny be regarded in at
jreat degree as controlling both. If pa- thi
r be used as the chief medium of circu- bei
lion, and the power be vested in the by
jvernmcnt of issuing it at pleasure, ly
her in the form of Treasury drafts or if
y oilier, or if banks be used as the pub- e.v
depositories, with liberty to regard all sc.rplussrs
from day to day as so much a^d- tin

sed to constant fluctuations, and itulus- the

ted by the double motive of concilia- nol
g the Government and augmenting their nej

ged extravagantly their discounts, thus cot
ibling all other existing banks to do the ed

ures of th.e respective States for si mi- ive

it, were readily granted and thus the km
gmcntatii?n of the circulating medium, the
nsisting almost exclusively of paper the
wincedu most fatal delusion. An illus- nth
tion, derived from the land sales of the bet
riod alluded to, will serve best to show ltai
[effect of the whole system. The aver- ow
e sales of public lands, for a period of 10 enl
ars prior to 1834, had not much ex- a f
eded 82,000,000 per annum. In 1834 ior
ey attained, in round numbers, to thp yo
nounl of 86,000,000. In the succeed- vo
g year, of 1S35, they reached $16,000,- ult
>0. wf
And the next year, of 1836, they a- wi
minted to the enormous sum of 825,000,. thi
)0. Thus crowding into the short space wl
" three years upwards of twenty-three bu
jars' purchase of public domain. So yc
iparent had become the necessity of ar:sting
this course of things, that theExe- of
ilive Department assumed the highly be
uesiionable power of discriminating in m
c funds to be used in payment by differ- M
it classes of public debtors?a discrimi- m

jrrect this most runious state of things of
y the exaction of specie in all payments of

curity. Within a few years past three <

ought him into power, but the elections
rough much of his term, seemed clearto
indicate a concurrence with him in
ntiment on the part of the people. Afr
the public moneys were withdrawn
om trie United States Bank, they were
aced in deposite with the State Banks,
id the result of that policy has been here
the country. To say nothing as to
e question whether that experiment was
ade under propitious or adverse circitminces,
it may safely be asserted that t

the existing sub-Treasury system
ps not seem to stand in higher favor i
th the people, but has recently been i
ndemned in a manner too plainly indi
led to admit of a doubt. Thus in the
ort period of eight years, the popular i
ice may be regarded as having succes. I
'ely condemned each of the threej]
liemes of finance to which I have ad- i
rted. As to the first it was introduced I
a lime (1816) when the Stale banks, <
:n comparatively few in number, had <
en forced to suspend specie payments i
reason of the war which had previous- j
prevailed with Great Britain. Whether, i
the United States Bank charter, which 1
pired in 1811, had been tenewed in due j
ison, it would have been enabled to con- |
ue specie payments during the war and t
; disastrous period to the commerce of t
! country which immediately succeeded, t
to say the least problematical; and ?
ether the United Slates Bink of 1816 t
iduced a restoration of specie payments, t
the same was accomplished through the c
trumentality of other means, was nmat- c
of some difficulty at that lime to deter- s
nc. Certain itis that, for the first yenr's d
( ration of that Bank, its course, was as a
astrous as for the greater part of its t
jseqneiit career it became eminently c
icessful. As to the second, the experi- i
nt was tried with a redundant Treasury, r
ich continued to increase until it seem- v
to be the part of wisdom to distribute r
i surplus revenue among the States;
ich, operating at the same time with me i (j
;cio circular, and the causes before nd ted
to, caused them to suspend specie |
,merits, and involve the country in the c
atest cmbarrasment. And, as to the
rd, if carried through all the stages of t
transmutation, Jrom paper and specie
nothing but the precious metals, to say j
hing of the insecurity of the public mofs,
its injurious effects have been anti
nted by the country in its unqualified j
idemnation. What is now to be regardas
the judgement of the Ameircnn Peo- g
on this whole subjects, I hare no accu. *
e means of determining but by appeal- r
: to their more immediate representss.
The late contest, which terminated
the election of Gen. Harrison to the {
jsidency, was decided on principles well
own and openly declared; and while r
i Sub-Treasury received, in the result, t
i most decited condemnation, yet no g
ier scheme of finnnce seemed to have t
;n concurred in. To you then, who ?
re come more directly from the body of j
r common constituents, I submit the
iro question, as best qualified to give J
nil exposition of their wishes and opin- ,
t9. I shall he ready to concur with

rce upon Congrgss the necessity of im- i
jsing upon commerce heavier burdens I
an those contemplated by the act of i
333, would act as an efficient remedial I
easure by being brought directly in aid i
the fStutes. As one sincerely devoted
the task of preserving a just balance in !
ir system of government by the mainte- i
ince of the Stales in a condition the most
ec and respectable, and in the full posssion
of all their power, I cannot otherise
than feel desirous for their er.iancipain
from the situation lu which the presre
on their finances now subjects them,
nd, while I must repudiate, as a measure
unded in error, and wanting constitutionsanction,
the slightest approach to an
sumption by -this Government cf the ,
>bts of the States, yet I can see in the
stribulion adverted tp, much to recom- i
eqd it, The compact between the pro- ,

jrjeiorStatcs and. this Government cx-1
jreasly-guaranty to the States all the tfen?fits
which may arise from the sales. The'
node by which this is to be effected addresses
itself to the discretion of Congress
is trustee for the Stales: and its exercise
after the most beneficial manner, is restrained
by nothing in the Constitution so
long as Congress shall consult that equality
in the distribution which the compacts
require. In the present conditionof some
of the States, the question of distribution
may be regarded as substantially a question
between direct and indirect taxation. If
the distribution be not made in some form
or other* the.necessity will daily become
more urgent with the debtor Slates for a
resort to an oppressive system of direct
taxation, or their credit* and necessarily
their power ami influence, will be gieally
diminished. The payment of taxes after
the most inconvenient ami . oppressive
mode will be exacted instead of contributions
for the most part voluntarily made,
and comparatively unoppressivc. The
States are emphatically the constituents
of this Government, ami we should be entirely
regardless of the objects held in
view by ihetn in the creation of this government,
if we could be indifferent to
their good. The happy effects of such
a measure upon all the States would be
immediately manifested. With the debtor
States it would effect the relief, to a great
extent, of the citizens from a heavy burden
of direct taxation which presses with
severity upon the laboring classes, and
eminently assist in restoring the general
prosperity. An immediate advance would
take place in the price of the Slate securities,
and the attitudes of the States would
become once more, as it ever should be,
lofty and erect. With States laboring
under no extreme pressure from debt, the
lund which they would derive from this
murce would enable them to improve their
:ondilion in an eminent degree. So far
is this government is concerned, appropriations
to domestic objects, approaching
n amount the revenue derived from the

i system of unequal and therefore unjust
egislalion would be substituted by one
lispensing equality to all the members of
his confederacy. Whether such distri-j
mtion should be made directly to the
Stales in the proceeds of the sales, or in
he form of profits by virtue of the operaions
of any fiscal agency, having thosepro:eeds
us its basis, sh >uld such measure be
onlemplatcd by Congress, would well decree
its consideration. Nor would such
lisposition of the proceeds of the sales in
my manner prevent Congress from time
o time from passing all necessary preoption
laws for the benefit of actual setlers,
or from making any new arrangenent
as to the price of the public lands
vhich might in future be esteemed desiable.
In reflecting on the proper means of
lefendipg the country, we cannot shut our
yes to the consequences which the introluction
and use of the power of steam upm
the ocean are likely to produce in wars
if maratime states. We ennnot yet see
he extent to which this power inny be
pplied in belligerent operations, connecing
itself as it does with recent improve
nent in the science ol gunnery n::u pro-i
ecliles; but we have no fear of being left, I
n regard to these things, behind the most
dive and skilful of other nations if the
[enius and enterprise of our fellow citizens
eceive the proper encouragement and diectiori
from Government. True wisdom
would, nevertheless, seem to dictate the j
lecessity of placing in perfect condition
hose fortifications which are designed for
he protection of our principal cities and
oodslcads. For the defence of our exended
maratime coast, our chief reliance
houhl be placed on our navy, aided by
hose inventions which are destined to re:ommcnd
themselves to public adoption,
hit no time should be lost in placing our
rrincipal cities on-the seaboard and lake.n
a state of entire security from foreign
issault. Separated as we are from the
rountries of the Old World, and in much
lnaffecled by their, policy, we arc happily
elieved from the necessity of maintaining
arge standing armies in times of peace.
The state of the navy pension fund requires
the immediate attention of Congress.
By the operation of the act of the
3d of March, 1837, entitled "An act for
the more equitable administration of the
navy ppnsion fund," that fund has been
exhausted. It will be seen from the accompanying
roport of the Commissioner
of Pensions that there trill be required for
the payment of navy pensioners on ihe
first of July next. $85,006 1-3, and on the
first of January, 1842, the 6um of $60,000.
fn addilion to these sums, about $6,000
will be required to pay. the arrears of pensions
which will probably be allowed between
the first of July and the first ot January,
1842, making in the whole $150,30606
1-3. To meet these payments there
is within the control of the Department
the sum of $28,040, leaving a deficit of
$121,966 OG 1 3. The public faith re
quires that immediate provision snoutu oe
made for the payment of these sums.
In order to introduce into the Navy a desirable
efficiency, a new system of accountability
may be indispensably necessary.
To mature a plan having for its object the
accomplishment of an end bo important,
and to meet the just expectations of the
country, requires more time than has yet
been allowed to the Secretary at the head
of the Department. The hope is indulged
