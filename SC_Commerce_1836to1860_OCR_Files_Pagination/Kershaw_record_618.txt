in the House, todnv, Mr* Holmes?the highly
esteemed and able representative from the
city of Charleston, appeared and took his scat.
Mr. Cost Johnson, win was entitled to the
floor, o.'vthc reference question, spoke, at considerable
length, in favor of sending the subject
of the tarifl' to the Coiinni'tes on Ways and
Means. He also viruhcti'ed himself and the
whig party from the i!targe that they were
~ pledged w a pro! pc ive tarilH Ku4, he rcmarked,
that Hie deficit in the Treasury was now
$1-1,000,! KM), and, in aao.'her year, would be at
least 'JO.fKM?in raising vrluc h revenue
fro n commerce t' to would necessarily ue a
nuflii'.'e :i: protoc.jo.i for minuiactine?. He oppomm,
'. waver, any principle of taxation not
inie.i i&k eole.y for revenue; and declared his
hostility evoa to the tariff o! 1S19. lie argued,
too, that there was a strong and perpetual hostility
befwccffilbe interest of commerce and agriculture,
on the one side, and domestic manufactures,
on the other, and lie would, as he said,
8upportno system of duties which did notrecog4
nize and protect the great corn, meat and tobac*
co interests. He insisted on countervailing duties,
which would force the governments of
Europe to do us justice by admitting our breadstuffs
and tobacco,^ duty free. Mr. T. C. Clark,
of N. Y., after adverting to the length of time
that the subject had consumed and the necessity
of attending to some other business, moved the
previous question.
Mr. Fillmore modified his motion 60 as to refer
so much of the message as relates to a discriminating
tariff and manufactures to the Committee
on Manufactures. The previous ques
tion was recorded by the casting vote of the
Speaker?the vote being 88 to 88. The main
question was ordered to be put, yeas 101, nays
97?close enough. The motion to refer to the
Ways and Means was lost, 95 to 104, and Mr.
Fillmore's motion then succeeded.
The remaining portion of the President's
message was then referred. The adjustment
of this question of reference, after all the debate
upon it, shews, distinctly, that a majority
of the House leans to the protective system.
It must be recollected that all our protective
tariffs have been made by the Western and Middle
States, and in opposition to a large majority
of the representatives from the Eastern States.
If, now, the representatives from New England
are compelled by the results of the former policy
of the government, to sustain a system into
which they were reluctantly driven, the protective
poliey will certainly be taken up.
In the Senate, to-day, Mr. Huntington, of
Con., spoke on the motion of Mr. Tallmadge to
refer to a Select Committee the "p^an finance."
He took strong grounds against President
Tyler and his whole scheme. He declared
it to be utterly incapable of any amendment?
It could not be freed from the objection that it
was a government bank, and that it subjected
the whole treasury and the revenues to the Exe
cutive. But even if this objection could be removed,
still he contended that the scheme
would be inefficient for any useful purpose.
Mr. Bates, of Mass., will have the floor for
to-morrow.
Washington, Jan. 4.
The debate on the President's plan of finance
was continued in Senate to-day, with great ardor.
Mr. Bates, of Mass. spoke in a tone of
more courtesy towards the President, and more
toleration towards the scheme than any one has
done before. Still, he had no idea of taking the
scheme as it was presented. He said, there m as
a necessity for doing something. A bank of discount,
he argued, was now out of the question,
"paper, for
the purpose of a uniform currency, would be
very valuable. He hoped therefore, that the
scheme would be so modified as to be beneficial,
and that Congress would then adopt it Mr.
Bates' speech m as quite a Tyler speech.
Mr. Filmore's project answers these questions
in the negative. The poor man's salt and-cugar,
and the coarse fabrichs m hich compose hie clothing,
are to be taxed, not because the nation
wants his hard earnings, but because the factory
owners have fixed their affections upon them,
and have set their tools in Congress at work to
extort them by devices of law.
Mr. Barrom-, of Louisiana, took a very different
view of the matter. He made the most
Dersonal speech that has been made against the
Cabinet. He intimated that the President was
dishonest?that he had promised this and that,
and broken the promise. He always distrusted,
he said, Mr Tyler's professions of integrity and
religion and would prefer that he would stick to
the Constitution. He attacked the scheme as a
plan to reduce the whole American people to a
dependence on the Executive. It would, very
soon, destroy the liberties of the oountry. It
had been read with ridicule by one party and
scorned by the other. He was apposed to the
reference?no good could come out of it, jio
modification would make it acceptable or expedient.
He hoped the Senate would strangle in
its cradle this monstrous progeny of Masachusetts
tederalism and Virginia abtractions.
Mr. Moorehead, of Ky. has the floor for tomorrow.
Vou will judge, from all that ha6
transpired, that the scheme finds no favor.?
'1 here i6 little chance that it will, in any form be
adopted.
In tiie House, to-day, Mr. Adams occupied
some time in pressing his motion to refer certain
petitions to abolish all rules excluding abortion
petitions, to a {Select Committee. Mr.
5 Merriweather, of Ga. moved to amend the same
so as to instruct the Committee to consider the

the one hour rule; and providing
that bills should be taken out of the Committee
of the whole at a convenient time. Some discussion,
in the course of which Mr. Adams betrayed
great excitement, took place; after which, the
whole affair was laid on the table.
Mr. Arnold, of Tennessee, then moved to reconsider
the vote referring the Tariff question
to the Committee on Manufactures. Mr. A. said
he would discuss the question at length, and
began with a personal attack on Mr Burke, of N.
il. There were many calls to order and 6ome
cenius.on took place lor the first time this session.
borne passages took place between Mr.
Burke?andseverai other members?particularly
Mr. Stanley and Mr. (Extra) YV. Smith
came into collision. Finally some question of
the cliair, pending which, the House, in the midst
of a gathering storm, adjourned.

hold that its proper and principal duty is to increase
the profits of those who own shares- in
manufacturing establishments. Mr. Fillmore,
of the House of Representatives, is an active
and zealous member of this political sect This
gentleman is in favor of seccuring the greatest
good to the great number, but he is for doing it in
a peculiar way. Whatever you give to the owners
of factrries, according to this gentleman, is
for the benefit of the whole community. Fatten
that member and you nourish the whole body

whole body is comfortable. Cherish the factory
owners, says Mr. Fillmore, keep them warm
and comfortable, enrich them by laws made for
their benefit secure them ample profits, and you
cannot imagine how jolly and comfortable the
rest of the country will be. ;
To bring before Congress a plan having this
philanthropic object, Mr. Fillmore has proposed
that the passage in Mr. Tyler's annual message
which relates to the tariff, should be referred
not to the Committee of Ways and meansj"T>ut
to the Committee of Manufactures, the dry nurse
of all projects for putting money into the pockets
of the manufacturers at the cost of the restTof
the community. We are glad to see that this
offer to do mischief has met with a vehement resistance.
Mr. Foster of Georgia, has called in
question, and with good reason, as we think, the
right of Congress to appoint a Committee on
Manufactures. The encouragement of manufactures
not being among the powers given to
the government by the Constitution,?by what
right do Congress proceed, as if it were fairly a
branch of their duties, and appoint a committee
to have it in special charge! Congress might
as well create a Committee on Medicine; they
might as well create a Committee on Domestic
Architecture, or Gardening, or Ship-building.?
The objection appears to us well taken, sound,
insuperable; and we hope to see the time when
Congress will no more think of usurping the patronage
of manufactures than of creating a board
of agriculture.
In the debate which took place on Thursday
last, it was urged, in order to give some plausibility
to Mr. Fillmore's proposal, that the President's
Message contemplated the protection of
our manufactures.?To this Mr. Rhett, according
to the report of the Globe, replied in these
forcible terms.
"He did not understand the message as recommending
a tariff with a view to protection,
but understood it as meaning a tariff for the purpose
of revenue. He also understood the message
as saying, that while thfey were legislating
with a view to the raising of revenue, there
should be such disposition made in the laying
of taxes as to give a benefit to manufacturers.?
The doctrine was a popular one, but he entirely
dissented from it Where did protection
commence? It was invariably at the point
where revenue ceased. The only way in which
the domestic manufacturer was to be benefitted,
is to have his yard of cloth introduced into the
consumption of the country in lieu of that
which comes in by importation, and pays a duty
into the Treasury. In that point of v,ew, how
was it possible to make a tariff both for revenue
and protection? The two were entirely incompatible
with each other. You must exclude the
foreign importation, and this is to destroy revenue,
before you can give protection to the manufacturer.
If the two were incompatible, as he
contended they were to protect manufacturers,
unless they impose duties for the destruction of
commerce, and the consequent destruction of
revenue!"
There is no resisting the force of this argujalgj
Mean.'
is a tacit confession of its justice; it is an acknowledgement
that a tariff for the benefit of the
factory owners is a very different thing from a
tariff for the raising revenue. The Globe in
discussing the question, says well:
"The manufactring capitalists, we think, will
be found among the wealthiest classes in the
community. What right have they to insist
that such a discrimination should be made in
levying duties on foreign commodities coming
in competition with their products, that the
great body of the people should pay two prices
for what they are obliged to consume, that the
double price may fall into corporate treasuries,
and the National Treasury be deprived of revenue
on the article to the whole extent of the exclusion,
for the benefit of the manufacturer, when
the whole pretence on which the tax is levied at
all, is revenue for the Government! Instead of
increasing the burdens of the mass of the people
for the emolument of privileged manufacturing
companies, ought not the discrimination have
an eye to deriving the greatest portion of the

favor of the laboring poor, who work to accumulate
wealth for the few?"
ROYAL WAYS OF THE BOURBONS.
We happen to have full accounts of the way
of living of the royal family in the days of their
prosperity, as well as of their adventures when
adversity overtook them. Up to the time when
the duke of Normandy was four years old, life in
the palace was as follows:?The oldest members
of the family were the king's aunts, the
great-aunts of the duke of Normandy. There
were four sisters, all unmarried. One of them
had gone into a convent and found herself very
happy there. Aft er the dullness of her life at
home, she quietly enjoyed taking her turn with
the other nuns in helping to cook in the kitchen,
and in looking after the linen in the washhouse.
Her three sisters led dreadfully dull
lives. They had each spacious apartments,
with ladies and gentlemen shers to wait on
them, and a reader to read aloud so many hours
a day, and money to buy whatever they liked.?

very dearly. They were without husbands and
children, and even intimate friends; for all
about them, of their on age and way of thinking,
were of a rank too far below their own to
be made intimate friends of. These ladies duly
attended divine service in the royal chapel, and
they did a great deal of embroidery and tapestry
work. When the proper hour came for paying
their respects to their niece the queen, they tied
on their large hooped petticoats, and other articles
of court-dress, had their trains borne by
their pages, and went to the queen's apartment
to make their courtesies and sit down for a little
while, chiefly to show that they had a right to
sit down unasked in the royal presence. In a
few minutes they went back to their apartment
slipped off their hooped petticoats and long
trains, and sat down to their work again. They
would have liked to have taken walks about
Paris and into the country, a6 they saw from
their windows that other ladies did, but it

They were fond of plants, aud longed above,

their own hands in a garden. But this, too was ,
thought out 6"f the question, and they were ;
obliged to be content with such flowers as would ;
grow in boxes on their window sills in the
palace. Madame Louise, the one who became I
a nun, employed a young lady to read to her j
while she yet lived in the palace. Sometimes
the poor girl read aloud for.five hours together,
' and when her failing voice showed that she was

Louise to fake the book herself, or askeoine one

EDUCATION.
An education is a young man's capital; for a
well informed,- intelligent mind has the best assurance
of future competency, and happiness.
A father's best gift to his child, then is a good
education. If you leave them wealthy, you,'
may insure their ruin at the best, you only
leave themthat which at any moment may be
lost.
If you leave them with a cultivated heart, affections
trained to objects of love and excellence,
a mind vigorous and enlarged, finding happiness
pure and elevated, in the pursuits of knowledge,
you effect an insurance on their after happiness
and usefulness. Unless you bring up the young
mind in this way, you cannot, with any justice,
claim for its inspector independence. Your
children must be virtuous, or they will not desire
it. They must be intelligent to have them
intelligent associates, as they must have habits
of industry and sobriety to make the company of
the industrious and sober agreeable. s
It is in your power to bestow this virtue, this
intelligence, and these golden habits. Present
them a good model in your own life. And give
them every opportunity to cultivate the heart
and the understanding. Spare not expense on
your school, and put into your children's hands
everv thinu- that mav encourage or assist them
in their mental or moral improvement.

To the Trustees of the Cokesbury Female School:
The Board of visitors selected to attend the
late examination of the young ladies of the
Cokesbury Female School having dischaJged
that duty, beg leave, respectfully, to
REPORT.
Their presence on that occasion has been the
source of the highest gratification, and it affords
them the greatest degree of pleasure to have it
in their power to bear testimony to the high
character of the School, and the exalted claims
which it is justly entitled, on the confidence and
support of its friends and patrons. The winning
address and gentle manners which characterised
the deportment of the young ladies, indicated
the happiest disciplinary training not less than
the brilliant specimens of intellectual attainment
| which shone so conspicuously. To particular|
ise, is not the design of-the Board, nor do th
' wish to draw invidious lines of distinction?suffice
it to say, that the familiarity exhibited with
the various branches of study covered by the ex-'
amination, reflected the highest honor on the ac-1
complished instructess, and the most distinguish-1
ed credit on the young ladies themselves. The j
Geographic! attainments of the younger portion
of the School could not but strike the Board

expectation, however, so far from meeting with
a defeat, was more than realised. In the departments
of Botany. Philosophy, Mathematics
and Languages, (French,) the result was in the
highest degree flattering, and not surpassed by
any thing ever witnessed by the Board. They

strings of the Guitar, touched by a master hand
awakened sensations not soon to be forgotten by
j the tasteful admirers of musical excellence?
! and the. well known accomplishment of the
i head of that department were exhibited in a
i manner the most impressive and commanding.
, In a word, as the result of their visitation, it is
i the decided impression of the Board, that the
i Cokcsbury Female School is not surpassed by
any similar intitution in the country, and that it
cannot share too largely the confidence, or be too
highly recommended to the patronage of the
public.

THE TARIFF.
Unexpectedly, a discussion has arisen in the
House of Represcntitives involving the princi-1
pie of Protective Tariff's. It is gratifying to
perceive in the remarks of members, the pro- j
gress which truth las made on the subject with
in a few years.
Formerly, it was considered a sectional measure,
favorable to the North, and oppressive <
only to the South Now, it is recognised as
equally or more injurious to the Northern Far- j
mer than to the Southern Planter, as well as
the Mercantile interests generally, which thrive <
best when the Farmers and Planters are most i
thriving. Inline, it is now understood to be a <
scheme to tax the productive labor of the whole i
country, North, South, and West, to enrich a '.
few individuals who have vested their capital in <
manufacturing establishments. Certainly such
a tax is most unjust, and will not be borne by 1
our people when properly understood. i
We will endeavor briefly to illustrate the difference
in their effect upon the people, of a <
Tarifffor Revenue, and a Tarifffor Protection. I
Take the articles of tea and cotton cloth, and I
suppose the Government wants to raise twoli
millions of dollars by import duties upon them./ ]
As tea ie not grown in this country, all the peo.1 <
?, JWf '
-J? V
I' 1 1 i^SS^BSSSSSSe^SSSSSSSSSSSSSS
pie pay (except a small portion of' the mer-;
chant's profit^ goes into the puhlic. Treasury.?
As about half the cotton goods consumed is,
manufactured in the country,.only"onehalf -the (
people pay in consequence of the enhanced j
price ocpaeioned by the duty, goes into the
Treasury, while the other half goes to the.
manufacturers. To get two millions into
the Treasury from cotton goeds, the government
is obliged to make the people pay four millions,
whereas to get two millions from tea, they
heed make the people pay only two millions.?
The account will stand thus, viz:
Say get two millions of dollars into the Treasury
by a tariff on cotton goods, the people pay,
in the increased price of cotton imported. 82,000,000.
In
the increased price of cottons manufactured
in the country, . 2,000,000
Whole amount paid by the People 84,000,000
To get two millions by a tariff on tea,
the whole being imported, the peo- .
pie pay in the increased price, . ^'2,000,000
it -f
Making a balance in favor of tariff
on tea, of $2,000,000
In exact proportion thai a Tariff7 for Protection
produces its intended effect, in the same proportion
does it increase the amount paid by the
People over the fair and natural price. Suppose
that three-fourths of the cotton goods consumed
in our country be manufactured at home, and
the government wishes to raise two millions of
dollars on imported cottons, then the people
would pay in the enhanced price
Of imported cottons, $2,000,000
Of cottons manufactured at home, 6,000,000
Total, $8,000,000
Showing an exaction of EIGHT MILLIONS
from the people, two only for the benefit of the
government,. and SIX for the benefit of the
manufacturers! ^ , ,
If nine-tenths be manufactured at home and
the government seek to raise two millions on the
tenth still imported, they must make the people
pay twenty millions, EIGHTEEN of them for
the benefit of the manufacturers!
And if such a duty exclude the foreign article
altogether, the WHOLE of the enhanced
price, be it TEN MILLIONS or TWENTY
MILLIONS, becomes a tax on the people for
the benefit of the manufacturers, and they must
then be raxed in some other way lor the support
of Government.
l'reciseiy tne same principle applies 10 every
other protected article.
Is this system right! In the course of a life
passed not without observation, we have learnt
that the human mind may be led to believe all
sorts of absurdities. But for the charity this
conviction has taught us, we should not believe
any intelligent man honest who would maintain
that such a system is beneficial or just to the
great body of the people. Yet multitudes of
honest men undoubtedly do believe it?believe
in effect that it is a blessing to the people to
force them by law to give a part of their earnings
for the purpose of building up inanufactunes
and enriching their owners.
We trust, however, that truth has made too
much progress to admit an increase of protective
duties in our day. Let the manufacturers
have the twenty per cent, protection allowed
them by the Compromise act; but, if the government
must have more revenue than a general
twenty percent, duty will yield, we say, let
it be raised by an increase of duties on the unprotected
articles only, thus taking from the
people only so much as is needed for government
jV>3u*s. jjui if thesA ihonopotigty
who are eternally applying to the government
to enrich them at the expense of every Farmer,
Plainer, Mechanic, and Working Man in the
country, are not satisfied with this, and insist
on going into a new partnership with the government
for the plunder of the people, we go for
reducing the duties on the protected articles,
and leaving tnem nereatter to snut lor tneniselves.
A discrimination against them is a
thousand times more just than discrimination
against the People, and if they press such an
is use, let it be met with the arms of truth and
reason.
Protecting American industry! Rather call it
a system to depress American industry?to tax
production?to compell the many to work for the
few to make us a nation of landlords and tenants,
of Princes and Paupers.
See in the following extracts from the last
English prpers, the blessed effects of such a
system in a country where it has been carried
to perfection:
Paisley.?The gloomy forebodings on the
subjeet of trade consequent on the near approach
of the fcmost flat season of the year are
more than being realized. During the past
week the number of working people, with their
wives and families, depending on the relief committee
for existence, has increased upwards of
two thousand, the total number being no less
than eight thousand eighthundred and thirty-six
persons who have no means of supporting themselves
except by charity.
Stockport.?The distress of the working
classes of this town, instead of diminishing, is
on the increase. Out of 8000 persons who
were assessed, upwards of 2000 have been
summoned as defaulters, and a new two shilling
rate has been figured. Scores of families are
literally starving, and no less than nine families
have not tasted bread for three weeks. The (
streets are crowded with men, women and children,
seeking relief, while the several shop
keepers are completely besieged by importunate '
beggars. .
As yet we may justly sing "Hail Columbia,
happy land;" but should the project ol our
Whig Leaders be carried out, we may find in
these accounts from Paisley and Stockport, true
pictures of our future Lowells and Pittsburgs, '
many of whose working people are now so <ie-1:
luded as to join in the cry of more protection for '
the benefit of men whom this system will as- *'
suredly make their masters.

of the port, a revenue cutter yesterday paid iis t

lying at anchor in the Hudson; off Jersey City, (

of those orders. These line little vessels are

and 'printers in particular, are called upon
to pay their bills, we would most respectfully request

But few- returns have yet been received?so far,
they are favorable to the democratic party.
CONGRESS.
We refer o tr readers to the "Correspondence
of the Charleston Courier," for Congressional
news. The Exchequer bill was still under discussion
in the Senate on the 5th inst. As the
scheme in its present shape, meets the views of
neither party, there is not much prospect of its
receiving the serious consideration of Congress,
or of lis being referred to any committee.
In the House, omthe Same day, Mr. Adams
kicked up'a considerable dust in relation to abolition
petitions. There was some sharp shooting
between Messrs. Arnold of Tenncsse, and Proftit,
of Indiana?the latter declaring that un'ca*
he was protected by the Speaker from such attacks
as those made on him by the former, he
should protect himself, and come to the House
armed for that purpose.
On the 7th, the House went into consideration
of a bill introduced on the day previous, to
authorize the issue of five millions of dollars in
Treasury Notes for the immediate relief of the
Treasury. This, our readers will recollect was
the plan recommended, by Mr. Calhoun during
the fl liscussion of the loan bill of the extrft
session, and had that course been adopted we
should not have heard the doleful lamentations
of our \vh7g~brethren, about an empty Treasury
and starving office-holders.
The Northeastern Boundary?The Bangor
(Me.) Whig states that the Commissioner for
running out the Northeastern iToundary line lias
closed his labors for the winter. lie has during
the past summer, had about one hundred
men in his employ, in removing trees from the
line. Sixty miles of the line remain to be surveyed.
ALABAMA.
It willj be seen by the following paragraph,
from the Flag of the Union, that Alabama has
followed the noble example set her by South Carolina,
and refused to receive any portion of the
Distribution bribe. Let the other Democratic
States of the Union follow in their footsteps, and
thus show that ''Democracy cannot be bought
and sold like the principles of modern whigism."
"Distribution.?The resolutions of the Hon.
Walker K. Baylor, the Senator from Jefferson
and St. Clair, against the distribution of the proceeds
of the sales of the public lands, passed the
Senate on Monday last, in the same shape they
came from his hand. The report of the committee,
which proposed to strike out the first resolution,
the one rejecting the distributive share that
may be allotted to Alabama' was no concurred in,
and the resolutions were adopted. We congratulate
the democracy of the whole Union upon this
glorious step on the part of our sterling democracy.
Alabama has rejected the bribe. So hasSouth
Carolina. So will New Hampshire?so
will the other Democratic States of the Confederacy.
Democracy connot be brought and sold
like the principeJs of modern Whigism. It is
purer than geld, and more precious than rubies.
We have saved our honor, and maintained our
indent stand. The bribe is rejected."
Fur the Camden Journal
Mr. Editor: I perceive that "Enual Rights"
ias come out in the most conspicouus place irt
pur paper with another grand flourish, while
'Fair Play" has to content himself with an obscure
corner.
The sophistry contained in his last communi:ation
might be as easily replied to as that in his
irst, but as I neither claim or expect the same>rivilege
he appears to have, viz: that of inspecing
the replies to his communications before
hey appear in print, I should have to meet him
>n unequal ground. The force of the reply is
.veakened, and this being the case, I must leave
iim to others, more able to compete with him
.ban myself. FAIR PLAY.
We do not say that the above is an ingenious
mode adopted by "Fair Plav" to evade a reply
o the hist number of "Equal .Rights." We do
ay however, that it resembles it very much.?
