Southern Manufactures.?It has long been a
! .' - matter of surprise to us that the people of the
?' South, as a body, devote so little attention to manu.
fkctures. We are aware that the interest of the
country is agricultural, and that the products of
the soil must continue to fce the biupia of commerce.
- e> Indeed, the softness of the climate, the unparalel.
led fertility of the soil, the peculiarity of the do.
mestic institutions, all strike us as a direct intima.
tion from the God of Nature ,that agriculture ought
to be the main pursuit of the inhabitants. But we
must not be understood as advocating, at present,
a general system whereby manufactures may become
an article of export. We are satisfied that, in this
respoct, it will be long ere the South be prepared to ,
enter into competition with other sections of the
country, whose inhabitants have acquired, by experience,
great facility in manufacturing, and whose
products, by having been long in use and well
known, fill up the demands of the market. We
oan even go so far as to say, that we should never
be willing to see the South exporting manufactures,
at all, unless the prices of cotton became bo precarious
as to make its cultivation a matter of too much
hazard. But what wo urge, is, that every State,
should entor just so largely upon manufacturing as
to satisfy the wants of its inhabitants. This will
do for the present, and if subsequent developments t
mane a more extensive system advisable, they can j
then enter upon a more enlarged sphoro: this ad. j
vantage too, in that case, will attend thom; the ^
production of articlos foi home consumption will Q
have given them experience'?will have carried them t
through tlie A. B. C. of manufacturing?will have j,
prepared them for entering largely into the business
with facility and confidence; two contingencies T
that have an am&2ing influonce on human under. ?
takings. m
But, " Sufficient unto tho day is the evil thereof."
The fluctuations of trade may or inay not mako it
necessary for the South to substitute manufactures
in the place of her present commercial staple.?
What wo have to do with is the present, and though
things should remain as now, until the ond of time,
yot the advantages of a manufacturing system for c
homo consumption, would bo almost incalculable. |
So many reasons in favor of tho measure are crow- S
ding upon us, that we arc at a loss what to selcct
first, or, indeed, whether wo had not better fi

subject without remarking upon the impositions at- jj
tempted upon Southern dealers by many Northern ^
? capitalists and manufacturers. The opinion seems
to bo too prevalent, that tho South is fuir plundor m
for any and all who are anxious to make money, 3<
without being troubled with scruples as to the means, o
Hence not only are exorbitant prices chargqd, but
lhi> articles transmitted nm nfton nf the mnnt indif
fcrcnt material. Wo do not speak unadvisubly. hi
The conduct, towards tlicir customers, of many n
who are dealt with by Southern merchants, resem. ]a
bles groatly thut of an honest farmer in the vicinity ,
of one of our colleges. If a calf died mysteriously
?if a chickon fell down with the pip?if a hen left e]
her nest without hatching?why, it mado no diffo- th
rence; the " boys" couldn't tell the odds in regard ai
to the chicken and the veal, and as for the eggs, c]
they wero a small mattor any how. So these merchants;
they are afraid to dispose of their inferior S<
articles near home, and therefore seud them off to a
Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama, &c., D
and merchants there M won't know the difference." c
We happened once to bo making a purchase in a
tore in Washington City. The merchant had a
large assortment of clothes on hand, which were all
too lato for the season, and of inferior quality?they
were the remains of his current stock; A gentle- T
man present oskod him what ho meant to do with
them " oh!" ho said "I shall just send thorn on, to ^
the South;" and scorned to considor it as much a
matter of courso that they should bo sent thero, as h
that they wore to bo disposed of at all. * Now, wc h
do not know the oxtcnt to which this feeling pre- j(
ails, but wo have met with it throughout the .
sphere of our observation, and if we mistako not, 1
it is a griovance generally complained of. If it has ^
not been folt in our own town, we are to thank tho g
circumspection and carefulness of our merchants 1
rather than the disinterestedness of those with whom
they doal
Anothor reason why domestic manufactures should j
be encouraged, is, that they can thus bo afforded
more cheaply to the people in general, without dimi- I
rushing the per centum profit of the retailer. The 11
implo item of freight, would be an important saving.
Beside that, it would bo an object with the manufaoturor
to sell as roasonablc as possible, in order to
receive general custom, and further, the articles '
manufactured would be of superior quality, because s
their circulation would bo confined mostly to the (
State in which they were made, and it would be no. ]
cessary for thorn to bo of tho beat quality in order to
secure the " run of tho market.** Add to this, that
they could bo mado choapcr, because labor is choa, 1
per here, than at the North. ]
We might speak of the improvement, in a moral
point of view, that would result from tho introduc.
tion of the manufacturing system. It would ele.
vato the pursuits of a large part of our population.
It would bring mind more in contact with mind.
It would develope onergies in tho mental constitution
of those engaged in it, thai might otherwise
remain dormant; it wculd diffuse a spirit of enter,
prise; it would elevate tho character of the poor;
and instil lifo and action into the various channels
of business. In addition to tho other pecuniary advantages
above related, it would keep at homo the
capital of the coon try: the money now tent off en
nually to the Northern cities would bo kept, witbii
oar own borders, end enrich our own population.
These remarks must not be interpreted into hoe
tility to the North, but rather into a sincere desir
for the good of the South. She needs nothing bu
a fair chance, and she will maintain her own grout*
abundantly. It is her duty to consult her interest
so far as it does not interfere with the lawfnl into
rests of others, end these ore interests on whicl
she has shown herself never disposed to infringe
! Our opportunities have not been as favorable as w<
1 could desire for procuring such statistics as would b<
' calculated to throw additional light on tho subject
but we hope to bo able hereafter to procure them
and give the subject farther consideration. In the
mean time we recommend the subject to the consi
deration of our frionds. We shall be disposed, cheer.
fVilIy and gladly, to open our columns to the ex.
prcssion of their views, and we beg them not to re.
strain them, in a matter so intimately blended with
the welfare of the South. We are not so arrogant
as to claim nor so presumptuous as to expect the
conformity of others, to any topic which we may
broach. Our object in this, as in cverv thino- ..l?
is to elicit the truth, and wo beg those who differ
from us in sentiment, to express the grounds of
their dissent; both sides of the question can then be
canvassed fairly, and tlie public mind make up its
eordict accordingly.
We wore somewhat astounded, a few days ago,
to receive per the Post Office, a copy of the New
Lisbon Aurora, a rank abolition print, directed to
this office. Wo had thought tho rebuke received by
.he Emancipator, when it tried to effect an exchange
vith Southern editors, was signal enough to deter
iny more of the fry from making a similar attempt.
3ut the fantical conductors of these prints are so
>razed over with tho common coating of rascality?
mpudonco?that it requires an Irishman's hint" to
iavo any effect upon thorn. If they are dotcrinined
0 continue sending us their vile trash, of course, wo
iavo no appeal. Tho mails are in operation, and
f they send it, wc cannot help it's coining to us.

composed is that mind which
(tows a piercing wit, quite void of ostenition"
but how excellently difficult 'tis to
nd a person who could wear the above
liaracter with ptopriety; the mind that
assesses a piecing wit, rarely allows an
pportunity to slip, when it can make a
splay in words; truly it diminishes the
tlue of such a treasure, thus to use it on |
