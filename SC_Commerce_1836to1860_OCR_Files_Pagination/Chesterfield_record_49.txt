millions of acres had been sold, it wo remember
rightly. This was sufficient U
supply the immense emigration of the las
thir y years.
In the year 1830 the sales will probabh
amount to twenty millions. The emigra
t >n has been much larger than usual; bu
we doubt whether much more than six mil
lions of acres have been taken by acttin
s ittlers. Congress have still nearly, o
quite, two hundred millions of acres in mar
ket, and a great many more millions ur
soon to be brought into market.
Now, we say, it would lie a profitab!
business for capitalists to engross a hr.n
dred millions of acres of these lands, if the
could conjure up purchasers from iln* so
to take tlie lands oT their hands at one hut!
urrd percent, advance on the first price.

MR. VAN BUREN'S ANSWERS TO MR. AVI I
LI A vis's QUESTIONS CONTINUED.
The following is the second'question.
Will you sign and approve a bill distribu
ting the proceeds of the sales of the pnbli
lands to each State according to the fedi
ral population of each for the purpose
above specified !
My views in regard to several publi
Questions, and amongst them the prope
I #
distribution of the public lands, were ask
ed by a portion of the citizens of my o\vi
S\ate shortly alter my nomination lor th<
Presidency. They were given in Augus!
1335, and upon the latter subject expres
sed in the following words: "In rcspec
to the public lands, I need only observe
that I regard the public domain as a trns
fund belonging to all the States, to f>e dis
posed of for their common benefit. Ampl
authority is for that purpose conferred up
on "Congress by ail express provision o
the constitution. In making such dispo
sition, that body should in my opinion ac
upon the principle, that the people of tin
I nked States have a greater interest it
an early settlement and substantial im
provement of the public lands, than in tin
amount of revenue which may be derivei
" 1 m _ l!_L ,
iroin tncm. io accompiisu mis oojwi
t!ie accumulation of large tracts in fov
hands should be discountenanced, and li!?'ral
facilities afforded to the acquisitior
ofsinail ()or;ions by such of our citizens
wherever residing, as arc in good faitl
desirous of fiossessing them as homes fo:
themselves and families. The particula
measures bv which these results arc to bi
secured, is matter of detail to be settled In
Congress, in the exercise of a sound di>
crction, aided by the lights of cxj>ericnee
and having reference to the general interests
ofthe country. The disposition o
the public lands proposed bv the bill /<
irhich President Jackson refused his as.
sent, teas, in my opinion, highly objectionable.
I therefore approved of its rejection
by him at that time, and all inv
subsequent reflection has confirmed me it
that opinion. I have watched the discussions
which this subject has since undergone
with all the attcn'ion which it*
importance demands and with an earnesi
desire to arrive at conclusions in regart
to it which shall best answer the requiremenrs
ofjus'ice, and promote the interests
of all the States, but have seen no cause
to doubt the correctness of these views. 1
am of opinion that the avails of the public
lands will be more equitably and faithful
Iv applied " to the common benefit of the
United States," bv their continued nppli.
cation to the general wants of the Treasury
than by any other mode that has yet been
suggested; aad that such an appropriation
is in every respect preferable to the distrihution
thereof among tiie States, in the
manner your question proposes. Entertaining
these views, I cannot give you
any encouragement that I will, in the
event of my election to the Presidency, lavoi
mat policy.
Mr. Williams's third question.
Will you sign and approve bills making
appropriations to improve navigable stream.above
ports of entry ?
I am not aware that ,korc is any qu?stion
in reference to the subject of interna
improvements by the Federal Government,
upon which my opinions have not beer
fully expressed in a letter written by mt
in October, 1832, when a candidate for th?:
Vice Presidency, to the Shocco Spring:
committee of North Carolina, and in a let
ler from the Attorney General of the I'm
ted States to Mr. Garland ofMeckleiv
burgh in 1835, in which he was author
ized to speak my sentiments in tiie matter
These documents have been frequently am
extensively published. Upon referring !<
them, you will find that from the first ac
tion of President Jackson upon this partic
ular portion of his official duties, whic,
happened while I iras a member of hi
cabinet, nutil the time when those letter
were written, there has been co-ope ratio,
in action and a general correspondence i
opinion between him and mystlf upon t!\
whole subject. In the views expressed b
hi in upon the particular question to whic
your inquiry extends, in his annual me<
sage to Congress in December, 1934,
fully concur.
* * * *
President Jackson has no where give
7/9 his views as to the particular provl
ions of the Federal Constitution, by whic
he conceives crpenditures of this characti
to be aiUorizsd. Upon referring to t!
early proceedings of the Government, \\
find that General Hamilton, while Seer
tary of the Treasury, contended tl at the
were warranted by the authority given 1
Congress to regulate commerce. .Mr. Je
f rson, on the other hand, whilst he d
pjvrtVd 'hr-ir ! ?>, ( vravnira.ra
. and abuse assumed that tln v could he jus.
> tificd under the power to maintain a navy,
t President Jackson has left the question of
constitutionally in the sta'e in which it
j was left by bis predecessors. Put hav
I ing had ac'ual proof of the tendency of
t j these appropriations to the abuses which
Mr. Jefferson apprehended, he has on.
1 ' deavorcd to apply to the subject a practical
r i remedy. With this view, he refused his
- assent to nil appropriations above ports of
c entry or delivery?not that he held the
mere fact of the establishment of such ports
e by Congress decisive of the question of
i-; constitutionality, hut because the constituy
tion, under the general discretion It conil
' tors in regard to the approval or disapprovi-!
al of bills, gives him the right to do so,
i without reference to the constitutional
i. : queslion, and because he thought its cxer t
j eis" would he highly conducive to the j
e ! public good. No one. I believe, con'cnds j
- j;hat the President ough% so far as it doI
ponded upon him, to have arreted al!
* appropriations of tin's character, nor could |
e 1 it with any show of propriet}* be ir.s?s4cd
that he should have given his consent to |
s ! die extension of them to objects of a char- !
1 acter altogether different from those which
c } have been promoted by grants from the
! Federal Treasury since the commence.
! nient of the Federal Government. That
" j the rule he adopted for the regulation of his
conduct in the matter, is free from ohjccI
tion, is not contended. I am, however,
i. satisfied that it has been productive of
c much good, and will, until a more satis..
factory one is suggested, give it my sups
part.
Mr. Williams's fourth question,
c Will you sign and approve (if it becomes
r necessary to s-cure and save from deprc.
ciation the revenue and finances ofthonau
tion, and to alFord a uniform sound currents
cy to the people of the I'nited Stages) a bill j
^ (with proper modification and restric. j
i. j nons.) chartering a bank of the I'nited j
t 1 States ?
I Iii the published letter of .Mr. Duller to J
it I Mr. (iarland, which lias already been re- J
. | lerrcd to, he thus states my opinions upon j
e the subject of the Dank : " Air. Van Du- I
. ren's opinions in regard to the Dank of
f the United States, were expressed in the
. Senate of the United States in 182^: rct
peated in his letter to the Shocco-Springs i
5 committee, whilst a candidate for the Vice j
! Presidency, and have been so freely utter-,
. ed by him, that there cannot, I think, be j
e? occasion to say much upon that subject.?
j Bu: to close the door to cavil, I state, 1st.
That he holds that Congress does not posp
sess t!ie power to establish a national bank
in any of the States, of the Union, nor to
j I establish, in any such States, the branch i
i of any bank located in the District of Co-1
1 j lumbia; and 2d. That he is, therefore, dc-!
p cidcdly opposed to the establishment of a j
r' national bank in any of the States ; and is j
2 i also opposed to the establishment of any '
? ' 1 * - - / < i I L_* I
! such bank m mo District or v. oiumom, as
. j unnecessary and inexpedient, and as liable
J to a great proportion of the abuses which
. 1 have, in his opinion, been practised by the
f | existing bank."

A letter from Bayonne, dated July 27, states
'l that all the public officers, <Src. had been rcmos

A letter from Frankfort, dated July 27, says

Mr. Nathan Rothschild had expressed very
great regret that he was not earlier sent for;

some of the papers laugh at these terrors.

Death of Ro'hschild.?Nathan Mayer Rothschild,
the celebrated London banker, died on
Thursday, July 2S, at Frankfort-on-the-Maine, .a
at 5 o'clock in the afternoon. Ho was only ^
fifty years of age. His visit to Frankfort was
to be present at the marriage of his son.
He was one of ten children, eight of whom
survive him?four brothers, two younger and | Ti
two older than himself, and four sisters. i w
He married the daughter of Mr. Cohen, a ! ^
merchant in London, who is said so little to "
have anticipated the success in life of his future ,(
son-in-law. that lie entertained some doubts r
about the prudence of the match; and Mr. t<
Rothschild was accordingly desired to produce |
testimonials as to his worldly means. The i
whimsical answer was, that, whatever number | a

not do hotter, so far as money and good char- j
a^ter went, than to give them all to Nathan i .v
Mayor Rothschild.
The death of this eminent banker is one of j
the most important events for London, and per-; o
haps for Europe, which have occurred for some t!
time?his financial transactions have pervaded j,
the whole continent, and may be said to have
exercised more or less influence on money bu- P
sinessof every description. No operations on 1
an equally large scale had existed in Europe c
previous to his time?tor they were so confined [\
to his own capital and resources, which were
immense, butjwere c.arried,on in conjunction
with his brothers in Paris, in Vienna, in Frank- t(
fort, and in Naples, all of whom possessed colossal
fortunes of their own. Resides which, lie
had .agencies established in almost every large s
city in the old or new world, all of which, under "
his direction, conducted extensive hrancnes of 0
various kinds. Nothing, therefore, was too
great or extended, provided the project was a s
reasonable one, for him to undertake. All the a
brothers of Mr. Rothschild are men of great tl
capacity and knowledge of business, but it. is f(
generally admitted that they deterred to his
indgment in all their undertakings, and that he swas
the moving principle of the great mass of 11
capital they represented. ri
M. Rothschild, like the rest of his brothers, p
held a patent of nobility with the title of Baron,
but he never assumed it, and was more justly
proud of that name, under which he had acquired
a distinction which no title could conver.

INDIAN WAK. K
a
JACKSONVILLE, (Florida,) Sept. 8. t<
Mr. Charles Dell, who left Newnansville on
Saturday last, states that for some time the b
Indians have been in the immediate neighbor- {,
hood of the Fort. It seems that they have (j
made their head quarters at Felasco (Col. ,
Sanchez' plantation) only four miles from New- (
nansville, and collecting cattle. penned them j
there for a night, and then drove them off to-! '<
wardsIlogtown prairie. The Indians on Tues- j b
day night of last week, came within 150 yards j r
of "the Fort and stripping a slip of bark from a ;
tree made some marks, which were intcrpre- ! ^
ted bv those skilled in Seminole hieroglyphicks j ,
to signify that 150 Indians were present at that !
place. It is impossible to say what force the f'

The women and children at Newnansville (]
must sutler incredible hardships, at night shut c
up in the Fort, alarmed, needy and sick. The
day is spent in the tents pitched around the
Fort. We are told that the number is near e
three huhdred. a
At Black Creek, the people from Alachua, r
who sought that place for security, and are h
encamped on both sides of the Creek for some
distance along the road, are suffering greatly :
from sickness. Such are their exposures to
the weather, their want of almost every com- j
fort of life, that the preservation of their healths
is a thing impossible. The measles and the
whooping cough still prevail among thern. !"]
These epidemics, in addition to the fevers |
consequent on their exposure, place those ! I
unfortunate people in "extremis rebus." It is i
said two thirds of them are now sick.?What
must be their suffering !?houseless, homeless,
lying upon the ground, exposed to the noonday 1(

. A party of Indians pursued and most of I
them killed. A party of Indians of from 25 to
.MO were seen passing through Lownds county i j
Ga. when about 40 whites collected and set out
in pursuit, following the trail until the morning
of the third day, (Aug. 13) when they came
up with the Indians at Gaskin's ferry on the c
Alaphia, their force having in the meantime e
increased to 60 men. They attacked the In- ij
dians, who soon dropped their plunder and t
plunged into the river. Only six however t
reached the opposite bank, two of these jj
wounded. The others were shot in the water; t
among them was a white man. Before the fc
Indians had been overtaken they had pluu- c
dcrcd a house on their way taking 25 lb. powder,
30 bars lead, ISO lb. shot, and $303 ,
j cash.
Only one white man was wounded in the s
J short engagement, a Mr. Peters. The plun- I
J der dropped by the Indians was sold and the ]
! proceeds 8170 given to Mr. Peters. f
On the 25th of August a party of hostile indians
was discovered near PiderTown on their ,
way to Florida. A company of 38 men was j
speedily raised, and in two divisions, one un- f
der Mr. James Gay and the other under Mr. j
Spencer Oliver, commenced pursuit. The J
trails were artfully scattered and dim, and the
Indians were fcretted out, and the pursuing
party came upon them in Irwin county, in an l
open piny wood. They charged on the Indi- ]
ans drawn up in a line. The battle lasted ;

New-York, SF.rr. 10.?Coffee.?The transaeions
of tlio week havo been fair, the demand
rincipally for export, rrime green and good
ava are wanted, the market being nearly bare
f both descriptions.
Cotton.?The business of the week in Cotton,
as bcon similar to the previous one, inacivc;
no shippers of any consideration. The
ilea confined to manufacturers who have taken 4
few lots at 10 a 20 cts. and one of fancy at '
bout 23 cents. Tho stock continue* light,
bout 14000 bales principally low qualities, and
cry little in the southern ports.
Flour.?Onr market for Western early in the
reck was excessively drill, and sales were with
iliiculty cfTocted at $8 50 to 8 75, but at tho
lose the market rallied, and sales readily made
t our quotations, which shows an advance of
ally 18 cts. per brl.
Sugar.?The demands is chiefly confined to
ogshead Sugars, of which there are few in maret,
and prices are firm. In box Sugars there is
iot ranch doing, and sales have been made at a
light reduction from previous prices.
Our Cotton market remains in a rather uninerestinf
condition, thoujrh the arrival and sale
a * o ?
f a few bales of the new crop has created, as
isual, some little coinpetiton between those who
ro anxious to secure these early receipts for di'*erent
manufactories in the northern State:.
I'he quality of the Cotton sold is said to be abont
;ood fair, and was disposed of as follows, viz: 4
ales at 18, 5 at 18, 3 at 18J, 11 at 1&$, 5 at 17,
nd 41 at 18 cents. Sales made under such cirumstanccs,
just as the season is about to open,
ut before any thing decided has been done, will
lot always serve as an index of the course of faure
transactions; and thoy sometimes lead to
xpectations that aro not afterwards realized.
Experience heretofore, has shown that thoso who
orward their Cotton early, have generally reap,
d the best prices, and our friends in the country
oing aware of this, will no doubt consult their
iwn interest and push business as much as poss;.
lc. For tho old Cotton on hand, there does not
ppcar to be any demand, though we are not
without a few sales to notice, viz: 19 bales Lou.
nana and Mississippi at 15$, 27 bales Texas at
6J, 400 Tennessee and X. Alabama at 12, 153

notations: white 14 a 14$, brown 9$ a 10.
Bacon.?Hams remain stationary as to price,
nd thero is very little inquiry; Middlings and
ihoulders havo improved a shade, and though
et in active demand, particularly the latter,
here is yet a fair business doing.
Lard.?Our quotations, 15 a 16 cents, aro full
