in the facts upon which they make up their judg
ments, or though it may be the result of education,
whenever they have to choose between offending
men, or their consciences, they went to work, be
lieving that slavery was wrong, and called loudly
far its abolishment in their public labours, and
made a forfeiture of church membership the pen- ,
alty for any in the societies to hold slaves; drew
up a petition to the next congress praying for a law
that would abolish the evil (as they believed it to
be;) and Dr. Coke even visited General Washing
ton and had an interview with him upon the sub
ject. In pursuance of this policy, some were ex
pelled from the societies, others were kept from
joining them. ■ •='.
But the question is, what good did all this dol
The good intended, was the freedom of the slaves,
. and perhaps only this ; but was this accomplished 1
Could it have been accomplished by the church 1
As it was not one of the church’s institutions, there
is notone instance that we know of, in which a
slave recovered his liberty by this means. But
very soon, a host of difficulties and evils growing
out of this policy, convinced Dr. Coke and those
who acted with him, that they were on the wrong
path ; and that the church had done better, if they
had not touched the question at all. In a little
time, discord reigned through the infant societies,
and the abolition, not of slavery, which they had
aimed at, but of Methodism in the whole of the
slave states was threatened j and Mr. Drew states,
in writing this portion of Dr. Coke’s history, “That
if Dr. Coke had continued his direct attack upon
the slave-trade, he must have abandoned the United
Slates and desisted from his great work, without
breaking the fetters of the Africans.” This was
the commencement of Methodist ecclesiastical in
terference with the subject, either by public lec
tures or disciplinary law ; and it would seem that
this fatal misstep should have been enough to have
convinced our church, that no good can come of
meddling with a subject that belongs to earthly gov
ernment. But upon Dr. Coke’s return from Eng
land, after having assailed this institution with such
violence, what did he find the state of things in re
gard to himself and the church, (which was the
burden of his soui;! wny, nis way was ueugeu
up j the slave-holders were in arms against him;
on one occasion he was waylaid by authority of law,
too, such as it was, and shot at. He was presented
by grand juries, and found guilty of an offence
against the government, (see his Life by Drew.)—
On another occasion, he was pursued after leaving
for England. Congress was offended at his peti
tion ; and there came up a deputation at the Con
ference in Virginia, asking for the repeal of the
Church Law about slavery, as it would abolish
Methodism from the country. Here the church
was well nigh destroyed ; the infant societies con
vulsed, and torn, and agitated; the church ren
dered disreputable ; the ministers assassinated and
mobbed ; and the door of the people’s hearts shut
against them, and their indignation excited; the
laws were offended, and the poor negroes not only
not freed, but shut out from religious benefit All
this mischief was done without any sort of good to
balance against it. Now, none will allow, that
these men aimed at any thing but good to the
church: nor can any doubt but that these feelings
were those they brought with them, not gathered
from religion and the Bible ; for they would have
had them just as strong without religion as with it.
It will not be forgo’ten how glad these good and
well-meaning men were, in the end, to let the rule
rest in the discipline as obsolete, because nothing but
ruin could come of it; Dr. Coke himself agreeing
to say no more about it publicly. So much for a
misstep in regard to what is the business of Ctcsar,
mistaking it for the work of the kingdom of God,
“ which is not of this world." May we learn wis
dom from the past, so as to obey the command of
God, who says, “ Submit yourselves to every ordi
nance of man for the Lord’s sake, whether it be to
king as supreme, or unto governors, as unto them
that are sent by him, for the punishment of evil
doers.”
Here we have the reasons why the Methodist
Episcopal Church has had this difficulty to contend
with all along, and why it has been agitated from
the beginning. It covered as an ecclesiastical unit,
civil communities differing widely in laws, customs,
institutions and public opinion. It attempted to
conform to one standard of political and civil judg
ment, by the force of ecclesiastical censures, all
its integral parts. It could but fail in the attempt.
But unfortunately the stress of the difficulty has
fallen on the poor slaves themselves. A mistaken
ecclesiastical policy has been obstructive of the
missionary work among them, and in many in
stances has shut up all the avenues of access to
their souls. Thousands have perished who other
wise might have received the instructions and con
solations of that gospel which Christ commanded
to be preached to every creature.
We may be instructed by our past History as to
the present duty and obligations of the church. It
can never be too strongly urged that the great mis
sionary work to which the southern department of
the M. E. Church is called, is home missions.
Here, in the heart of this Christian land, there are
thousands of our fellow creatures, who need the
• gospel; who cannot go after Christian instruction,
but must wait until it comes after them. Door
after door is, by a good providence, opening to our
missionaries, and field after field is becoming white
to harvest. Were the prevailing opinions at the
North, sanctioned by Southern Methodist ministers,
it is evident enough that all access to the plantations
would be closed immediately against them. The
everlasting agitation, and the increasing excite
ment on this very subject, by ecclesiastical bodies
at a distance, calls for a protest on our part. As
ministers of Jesus Christ, our business is with
men’s souls. For their civil condition we are not
responsible; let the statesman and politician look
to this. But we are responsible for all ecclesiasti
cal procedures which have a legitimate tendency to
interfere with our solemn vocation of carrying the
gospel to the poor; of preaching Christ crucified to
every creature, and emphatically to the destitute
black man in our own midst. May I not ask every
Methodist who loves our Lord Jesus Christ, and the
souls which he has bought with his blood, to aid in
having this whole class of difficulties removed, by
expunging from the Discipline the obnoxious arti
cles on this subject, except that article in the gene
ral Rules, which concerns only the slave-trade,
about which all are agreed. Justice.

CHERAW DISTRICT.
Dear Brother Wightman,—I have just completed
my third round on the Cheraw District, for the pre
sent year, and closed my camp-meeting tour,—and
have great reason to exclaim “the Lord has done
great things for us, whereof we are glad.” The
preachers nearly all met their first appointments,
driving through mud, rain, high-water, sleet and
snow-storms,—in search of their appointments and
the people of their charge,—thus going every where
(in the bounds of their charge) preaching, “the
Lord working with them and confirming the word
with eigne following.” The local preachers,—ex
horters, class-leaders, all came up manfully to the
help of the Lord against the mighty ; and while
the leaders of God’s host were crying to the Most
High in prayer, the people were looking for better
times, and I had scarcely completed my first round
of quarterly visitations when we had signs of a
gracious visitation. With the commencement of the |
second round, the reviving flame broke out, com
mencing in Cheraw, where a goodly number were
converted, and where there has been a good state
of feeling ever since, about one hundred having
been admitted on trial since Conference. The
work next was seen in the Wadesboro circuit
where it has been going on ever since, in mighty
power. Also in the Montgomery circuit a gracious
and powerful revival has been going on. In the
Rockingham circuit there have been a goodly num
ber converted, and about three hundred admitted
on trial in the church. There has been a gracious
work also on the Centre circuit: we are still en
larging our borders,—and between four and five
hundred have been admitted on trial this year.
Chesterfield circuit too, has been visited with a
gracious reviving influence. Indeed the work of
has been advanced and a revival realized more or
less in all the circuits on the District. My last round
embraced the camp-meeting visitations, which was
a season of great refreshing to the church. The
first camp-meeting we held on the District was at
Concord camp-ground Centre circuit. There Me
thodism is in its infancy, but we had a large serious
congregation, and although the camp-ground was
within a half mile of the village (Concord), we
were permitted to worship undisturbed day and
night
About fifty or sixty were added to the church at
the camp-ground and at the village, where the
meeting was continued for several days. Our next
camp-meeting was held at Pleasant Grove, Plea
sant Grove circuit. Here the Rev. J. Jenkins was
with us,—and his labours were highly appreciated
and blessed. This was a good meeting ; fifty odd
joined the church, and near that number were con
verted. The camp-meeting at Emory camp-ground,
Centre circuit, was a good meeting; thirty-three
added to the church;—professors were much quick
ened and revived. My next meeting was in Wades
boro’ circuit, Concord camp-ground. Here we had
an extraordinary manifestation of the diyine pres
ence. One hundred and ninety-five were admitted
on trial, and it was thought near that number were I
converted. Father Jenkins was still with us,
preaching with his usual zeal and power;—and
you must remember, he was now travelling and
preaching, where he laboured and preached forty
years ago. The next meeting was held at Zion,
Rockingham circuit. Here, I trust, there was
good done. The next was held at Smyrna, in
Montgomery circuit. We had a good meeting,
some converts, and the church much quickened
and revived. A powerful meeting was held at
Maroney’s camp-ground, Deep River circuit.—
Numbers were awakened and converted, and the
church much built up. Our next meeting was at
Centre. Here, too, we had a powerful time. One
hundred and eight were admitted on trial, and sev
enty or eighty converts. The meeting at Poplar
Grove, Chesterfield circuit, was also excellent, and
twenty-five or thirty professed to obtain pardon and
peace in believing. Thus, it will be seen, that our
experience of the value of camp-meetings the
present year, has been different from that of our
beloved brother Smith, of the Cherokee District,
Georgia Conference. They have proved with us,
a powerful auxiliary to the regular circuit work,
and scores and hundreds will have reason to bless
God for them, to all eternity.
And now, in conclusion, we have great reasons to
be thankful to God for his goodness and mercy to
wards us; for, although some of us have been
called to pass through the furnace of affliction, we
are still alive, and able to be at our posts. The
whole number admitted on trial on the district, is
near three thousand up to this date. I could say
much more to the glory of God, but my sheet is
full, and I must slop. To God be all the praise.

CHESTERFIELD CIRCUIT.
Dear Brother,—A few things in reference to the
spiritual interests of this circuit, may not be unac
ceptable to your readers ; especially as I have the
pleasure to report the spread of religion, and the
improvement of the missionary feeling among us.—
At a meeting held at Chesterfield C. H., and con
tinued for twelve successive days, twenty-five
whites, and a considerable number of coloured
persons were happily converted, and thirty were
admitted on trial in the Methodist E. Church. At
the Poplar Grove camp-meeting not less than fifty
whites were reported as converts ; so that we bless
God for camp-meetings. Again, we have just closed
a three days’ meeting at Fork Creek Church, which
resulted in the conversion of fifteen or twenty
souls at least, and fifty-six joined on trial, mostly
whites. At several other appointments, there have
been a number converted, and added to the church.
So that, after the storm we have had here, we are
now enjoying peace in all our membership, and I
think there is decidedly an increasing improvement
in the church on this circuit. O that God may
kindle such a fire here as shall never be put out.
We are doing pretty well for the missionary
cause, as you shall see from our report at the An
nual Conference, if we are permitted to live to
make it. Yes, a better report in that particular
than usual, for Chesterfield; which is another evi
dence that God is reviving his work among us. In
proof of this, I will only say, that at our camp-meet
ing at Poplar Grove,—where the congregation was
small, we raised at our missionary meeting in
pledges and cash, $30 for the debt alone. Is not
that pretty good for the sand hills 1 At the Poplar
Grove camp-meeting we raised $28 for missions.—
Yes, brother Wightinan, although this circuit has
got a bad name (unjustly too,) it will send up a
missionary collection (if I am not deceived,) that
would make some of those brethren who live on
red and rich lands, and where the people are three
times as numerous, blush t$4Kid themselves ex
celled by the thinly settled ^ipulation of the Sand
hills. And in addition to all that, they will send
their preacher to Conference, (if we are not de
ceived,) well fed, supported, and well clothed; and
not with a 25 cent Conference collection,* but we
hope a very respectable one. God’s name be prais
ed for all his mercies. Affectionately yours,
October 31, 1843. Abel Hoyle.

CAMP-MEETING AT SMYRNA, COKES.
BURY CIRCUIT.
Brother Wighlman,—Our camp-meeting at
Smyrna began on Wednesday, the 4th of October.
Such was the good spirit prevailing'in the whole
community, that the tents were nearly all occupied
by Wednesday night There was only one minis
ter in attendance that night. But our good and
gracious God was with us. Prayer had been fre
quently and importunately offered up for a gracious
influence to be fell; and thanks to God, prayer pre
vailed. Having had such a time of power and sal
vation the last camp-meeting, unbelief suggested,
that similar scenes might not be expected shortly
again. The very first assemblage, however, was
signa^y owned in a gracious refreshing upon the
hearts of both old and young professors. A consid
erable number of those who were converted the
last camp-meeting, as evidence of their continu
ance in well doing, came into the altar the first
night. There was a shout in the camp. So the
next day, as we had an increase of labourers, the
presence of the Lord was felt in every sermon, in
a degree;—but not until the meeting had consid
erably advanced, did the work of conversion go on
so powerfully. On Saturday, the anniversary of
the Circuit Missionary Society was celebrated, con- j
eluding the services which were commenced at the
Sharon camp-meeting. The Report was read by
the secretary, and the sermon preached by the
Rev. James Dannelly. This was a close, heart
searching, powerful sermon, and in a very special
manner owned of God, in the deep impressions
made upon a large, serious, and attentive audience.
The public collection in favour of the society was
then taken up, amounting to about sixty dollars. A
proposition was then made by the senior preacher
of the circuit, to be one of twenty to raise one
hundred dollars, which was responded to by more
than the number necessary. Several other propo
sitions of a less amount were responded to; and
although the congregation was not so large as on
former occasions, and the purses of the people, as
was supposed, had been pretty well drained before;
and although even the most sanguine hardly thought
that we could approach the very liberal collection
taken up the past, year, yet you will be pleased,
when we say, we raised the handsome amount of
three hundred and twenty-five dollars in money and
good pledges. The missionary fire is still burning,
you will perceive, in our circuit. “ The liberal
soul shall be made fat.” This, we believe, is the
case here ; for those who gave last year so liber
ally, felt this year, they had still the means, by the
blessing of the Lord, and the willing mind, to do it
The good feeling did not die away by this little
digression from ordinary services. The work of
the Lord seemed to receive a fresh impulse. Sah
bath was a day of power and of glorious grace.—
Monday was the great day of the feast, and at the
close on Tuesday morning, we numbered nearly
sixty conversions among the whites, and a goodly
number of coloured; and one hundred and twenty
six added to the church. W. Crook.

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN.
You are aware that for nearly two years I have
been endeavoring to procure the means of purchas
ing a Parsonage at Marion Village, for the accom
modation of the Presiding Elder’s family, of the |
Wilmington District. I have succeeded so far in
obtaining subscriptions, as to be able, on the faith
thereof, to bargain for a house and lot, for the above
purpose; and now, as it is impossible for me to see
those persons who have subscribed, I hereby re
quest each of you, brethren and friends, who are
pledged in this matter, to pay the amount forthwith
to one of your travelling preachers, who will hand
it to me at his earliest opportunity, with the name
of each contributor; and will give a receipt,
if required.
Brother,—Friend,—whoever you are, who have
subscribed to this object, I beg you to respond
promptly to this call. Reflect for a moment;—on
the faith of the pledges given me I have bargained
for a Parsonage, but I cannot pay till the subscrip
tions are collected ; and I therefore earnestly en
treat you to do your part at once in relieving me.
Each one doing this, the work will be performed at
once. I beg you, immediately on reading this no
tice, to lay by you sacredly the amount for which
you are pledged, and meet your preacher at his next
appointment, or sooner, and pay it over to him.
The preachers in the District are earnestly so
licited to aid as far as they can in this matter.
A full showing will be made as soon as the bus
iness is closed. II. A. C. Walker.

GENERAL INTELLIGENCE.
DOMESTIC.
Melancholy Suicide.—On Monday morning,
the 23d ult., about half past four, Lieut. George C.
Wyche, attached to the U. S. ship Ohio, was found
in North Market street Boston, having, in a state
of partial intoxication, fallen into a box. He was
taken up by the watch, and removed to the watch
house under the new court house.
On visiting his cell about nine o’clock, he was
found hanging lifeless from the grating over the
door, having hung himself with his handkerchief.
The act was undoubtedly prompted by the deep
mortification which his incarceration must have
produced.
Lieut. Wyche was a native of Virginia, but re
sided in Alabama. He was about 35 years old, and
had been in the navy fifteen years. He was a
generous, noble-hearted man, and his death cannot
but be deeply lamented by all who were so fortuuate
as to know him. His remains were conveyed on
board the Ohio and were buried with the honors of
war!”
A Yankee Crusader.—A correspondent of the
Boston Atlas, writing from Paris, says, “ While at
the American legation, a few days since, a rough
looking backwoodsman entered, clad in home-spun,
with a passport in one hand, and a French dictionary
in the other. He wished to have the former vised.
‘Where for?’ ‘Jerusalem.’ ‘How are you going
there?’ ‘On foot.’ He was a blacksmith from Ohio,
had been brought out at a camp-meeting, and con
ceived some Miller-like views of the coming of the
Saviour.—So he had left his family, and managed
to get here via England. He left that afternoon,
for Jerusalem, on foot, with very little money, and
unable to speak a word of French,—and is, I am
told, the third who has passed through Paris on a
like errand.”
The Remains of Com. Porter.—The Philadel
phia Inquirer says that the brig of war Truxton is
expected to arrive daily in the Delaware, with the
remains of Commodore Porter. On her arrival the
body is to be conveyed to the residence of his friend,
the Rev. Dr. Ducachet, in Girard street, and there
to remain until the arrangements shall be made for
the funeral. The funeral service to be performed
at St. Stephen’s Church; and the remains of the
gallant old Commodore are to be taken to the
Naval Asylum, at which, by order of the Secre
tary of the Navy, with the consent of the family
of the deceased, they are to be interred.
Mysteries of Printers.—Dr. Squork unites to
a great1 intellect a most remarkable simplicity. He
lately observed in conversation, that one of the most
surprising things to his mind, and one for which he
could never account, was how a newspaper waa al
ways just so full,—the matter always hit just right,
—ft neither fell short nor overran. “ The chan
ces,” said the Dr. with animation, u are a million
to one against it happening as it does.” We said
nothing, except that there were some mysteries very
properly confided to printers.—Boston Post.
Suspension of Labor on the Sabbath in the
Office of the Sun.—We observe with pleasure
that the Daily Sun, of this city, has given notice
that advertisements intended for its columns on
Monday, “ must be sent in before 10 o’clock on
Saturday night, otherwise they will not appear, the
office being closed on the Sabbath day.” The Sun
is a well conducted paper, and the public, we have
no doubt, will abundantly sustain the Editor and
Proprietors in their arrangements to have their
Printers rest on the Sabbath, according to the
commandment.—-Philadelphia Paper.
Ivory Nut—A nut has recently been brought
to England, and a few of them thence to this coun
try, resembling the horse chesnut in its exterior
appearance, but the interior is solid, and white, as
hard as ivory, and resembles the elephant’s tooth so
exactly that none would suspect it of being any
thing else. It is so hard as to receive a polish even
superior to ivory, and can only be cut in a lathe.
When taken from the tree it is a milky pulp, and
may be reduced to that state again, in warm water.
Potato Trade.—The Maine Cultivator says
that more than twelve thousand bushels of potatoes
were brought into llaliowell last week and sold for
shipment. Farmers have received cash down for
them, at a good price, twenty-three to twenty-five
cents per bushel. Lately no less than fifty potato
teams were in the streets at one time. About three
thousand dollars, therefore have been paid to the
farmers on the Kennebec in one week for potatoes
alone.
Improved Umbrella.—We learn from the Al
bany Atlas that Mr. William Richardson, a me
chanic of that city, has invented an improvement on
the common umbrella. The ribs on which the
cloth is extended are so jointed as to fold up, and a
part of the handle can be detached, so that the
largest sized umbrella can be packed in a valise.
Mr. R. received a premium for some most beauti
fully finished specimens of parasols at the late fair
at Rochester.
Liberality.—The Rev. Dr. Skinner’s congre
gation, though including a number of persons of j
considerable wealth, has from the commencement
been burthened by a debt of eight thousand dollars.
It was determined at last to make an effort to throw
it off. The pastor preached last Sabbath morning
with reference to the subject, and after the service
a subcription was made of six thousand dollars, and
it is understood that a gentleman distinguished for |
his liberality, is ready to supply the deficiency.—N.
Y. Jour, of Com.
i , '
Carrying FireArms.—A few days ago, in trans-!
ferring some baggage from the porter’s cart to the j
deck of one of our steamboats, among which was a
double-barrel shot gun, which, getting a fall, was
instanly discharged, the contents passing through
the dress of a lady standing near, taking out pieces
as large as one’s hand from her dress and under
clothes, escaping only a short space from the body.
Her dress was ruined, but fortunately no further
damage was done. The owner could not be found,
and consequently the lady got no redress.—New
Haven Herald.
Poultry.—The American Poultry Book says the
Duck is rather a warlike bird, and awkard and
clumsy as he appears, is more than a match for the
stoutest cock in the poultry yard. The goose is a
quiet, inoffensive bird, and lives to a great ago—if
he is not killed. There are authentic statements
to the effect that they live to be seventy or eighty
years old.

v- '■ PROSPECTUS.
OF THE
SOUTHERN QUARTERLY REVIEW.
In commencing the Fifth Volume of this publica
tion, the Editor wishes to urge, with earnestness,
its claims upon the patronage and support of the
Citizens of the South. Its circulation, always re
spectable, but never large, requires to be, and, it is
believed, may be, much extended, and the work be
thus rendered a more efficient organ in maintaining
the rights and sustaining the literary reputation of
the Southern States. The discontinuance of other
periodicals, which have divided the public patron
age, renders the present time a peculiarly appropri
ate one for presenting such considerations as will
awaken a new interest in it, and for making such
efforts to extend its circulation as will place it on a
permanent basis.
it may do proper to state, briefly, the leading ob
jects which such a Periodical proposes to accom
plish, and also the reasons, which show the impor
tance and necessity of sustaining one with energy,
at the present time, at the South.
The general objects of such Periodicals are
pretty well understood. They serve to embody the
opinions of enlightened minds on all great questions
in which the interests of the arts, sciences, letters
and politics are involved, at certain periods in the
history of the country. Their aim is, not only to
review books, and, in the spirit of thorough and
impartial criticism, to decide upon their merits, but
also, in the performance of this duty, to discuss im
portant subjects in such a manner as to make deep
and permanent impressions upon the character of
the people and the destinies of the age; to diffuse
knowledge, not to foster prejudices; to create, di
rect and control, not to echo, opinions; and finally,
to canvass principles and maintain truth in a calm
and dignified manner, and in a style chaste, lumi
nous, nervous and appropriate. The offspring of a
high state of civilization, they furnish evidence of
intellectual advancement, and are the object of a
just and honourable pride, regarded as the exponents
of the literary standing and character of communi
ties.
The importance of sustaining such a work at the
South, with ability and effect, is equally obvious.
The South, like the North, and the other sections of
the Union, owes a duty to the age and to the coun
try in behalf of her literature. She requires an
able and high-toned Periodical, that is fitted to nour
ish, and call into active exercise, the literary talent
of our Southern Commonwealths. But, more than
this, our institutions are peculiar, and require a dis
tinct organ through which they may be defended
with power and spirit, when assailed, as they often
are, by other sections of the American Confederacy.
This aggressive conduct on the part of our Coun
trymen, so prejudicial to the general harmony, re
quires to be met and repelled by argument, first, and
by action, if necessary, afterwards. The South is
an agricultural country, and her position is different
from that of othersections more particularly devoted
to commerce and manufactures. Her views of her
peculiar interests should be known, and require to
be maintained and defended with ability, through
some such channel.
