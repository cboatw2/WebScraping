From an article under our Agricultural head, thi
copied from the Farmer's Register, it would 11
seem that the Tomato is a protection against tj,;
Chinch Bug lfthis should really prove to be mc
the case, the discovery is invaluable to parts of ret
the country infosted by that destructive insect. J
We some weeks sgo suggested the trial of China, roj
or Pride of India leaves, and the elder. From
whit we know of the aversion of most, if not j<
all insects to this tree and shrub wo still think
them worth trying, when no better remedy can
be procured. If however the tomato is found to Ti
prove effectual it is more easily propagated, and
plantod in the middle of the row, can do corn C;
little injury. It would prevent raising a crop of
peas with the corn. But the crop of peas is ^
much less valuable than that of corn, it would
therefore be better to lose it, if either must be P'
ioat. O.
Pi
But supposing the tomato to be a protection to
Indian corn when planted among it, can it B
be used to protect wheat and oats ? It could, we ^
sappese, be done only by planting a row round
the field and one here and there across, which
as the bug travels on the ground might possibly O
interrupt his progress. Si
We take it tor granted that all in the bug re. g
gion will stop eating tomatoes for the present p{
season and save all their seed. Those who do T
not plant themselves, may benefit their friends
and neighbors, and especially the poor, who arc
least iprt. to have such articles ia their gardens,by
saving seed for them. ^
We counted the present week, more than four ^
hundred bads on a moras multicaulis tree, from q
1 single bud cutting planted last spring in an A
eight acre field adjoiningthis town. In the same E
field there are hundrods of trees of the same age
which average more than 210 buds, and no incon- jj
siderable number which exceed 3 )0

The steamer Santee, arrived here yesterday,

the News of that place of 17th inst.
We learn that six more Indians, who had
>me in at Smyrna, for provisions, were captured
at on board the Santee, and taken to St. Auistino,
where tlicy were put in confinement.
It is stated that Sam Jones, the Seminole
hicf, paid a visit to Lieut. Tompkins, at New
ivei, on the 11th inst. Ho evinced strong
idignation at the conduct of the Indians, in
lurdering the soldiers of Col. Harney's com.
tand.
"In his talk he said that he had found the
hite man was his fri -nd, and that he would
ever again raise his hand against them. He
as sent a tunner to find out tho cause of the
arrid murder of Col. Harney's man, and as soon
; he returns, he is determined to punish the
urdcrers. He says he has no men with him
proscnt, but has sont them aloi g the coast,
id in the interior to collect the stragglers, and
t them tfnite their strength, that he may more
isily overtake them. That wo must not for a
oment think that he will give over the matter,
'hat he is determined to punish tho Spanish
Indians. He thinks there are some white men
connectod with them, and also, that Sandy, the
interpreter, excited them, or told them some lies.
He says that ho has known S.indy s'mce ho was
a boy, and that he is a treacherous rascal, that
ho has not > he sense of a white man, ho has not
the senso of an Indian, he has not the sense of
a negro. That he h;u? b.-en eating white bread
with the white man, but if he did not take caro
he will make him cat turtle yet.M
The Philadelphia Inquirer states that, in
consequence of information which transpired a
few days6ince at New York, a Custom House
officer came on from that city on Monday
morning, and made a seizure or a large consignment
of woollen cloths at a rpepectnble
commission merchant's store in Front 6treet.
Rumor gives various accounts as to the value
of the goods seized?from sixty thousand to
one hundred thousand dollars. It is. at any
rate, the largest seizure ever made in Philadelphia.
The grounds for proceeding on the
part of the Custom House are said to be making
entries at less than the real value. It i?
rumored that the importer, for some years a
resident of New York, is now missing.

The Low Black Schooner Captured.
The runaway schooner has been captured
by the U. S. surveying brig Washington,
Lieut. Gedney and carried into New London.
She is the "A r mis tad," of Puerto Princi,*1,
Cuba, and was owned by a Mr. Carrias, of that
place At the time she was tak n possession
of by the slaves, she wa9 bound from Havana
to N? uvitas with a cargo of dry goods, and
about fifty slaves. The slaves rose upon the
captain and passengers, and killed nearly the
wh<?le of them.
The trial of these blacks will involve several
curious questions, which we shall notice hcrealter.
P. S. Since writing the above, we have
received the following letter:
Correspondence of the Journal of Commerce.
New London, Aug. 27, 1839
The surveying brig Washington, Lieut.
Gedney, put in here last nigh*, with the
schooner reported by your pilot boats. S;ie
proves to be the schooner which left Havana
in June, with negroes, for a neighboring port.
The slaves murdered all the white men, and
then intended to go to Africa but brought up
on this coast. She had touched near Montauk
Point, and got a supply of water. &c.
The head negro jumped overboard, when
the boats from the brig came along side, and
it was with some difficulty he was recovered
and saved. The negroes made no resistance.
One of the white men saved is the owner of
the slaves, as he says. One or two of the negroes
died yesterday and several ar? aiok. It
is said there is mou^y and jewels on board of
the vatue of $40,000, but this is mere report.
The schooner les down the harbor, awaiting
the arrival of the U. S. Marshal.
[ This is an interesting exploit for the boys
of the Washington, for she i9 manned with
' thirty or forty Navy apprentice boys, and only
three or four men. She is engaged in surveying
the coast. Eds. Jour. Com.]

APPALING STATEMENT.
From a statement made by the comraittea
of the British and Foreign Sailor's Society, it
appears that within the short period of tour
months and three days previous to April last,
there had been wrecked one hundred and sixty
vessels, all of u hose cr nvs had perished !
Averaging the crew of each ship at ten, will
give a loss of one thousand six hundred lives !
It is farther shown that of vessels stranded,
foundered, abandoned, not heard of, &c. within
the same period, the number of vessels afTec*ted
by such catastrophes is five hundred and
seventy-six.

of Letitia Cox, on Bybrook's plantation, states
that this Ionian was considered for many
years, the oldest person on the island. She
was according to the journal, a young woman
at the period of the great earthquake of 1692,
by which Port Royal was destroyed. Now
supposing that she was then only fourteen
years of age, she must have been aged upwards
of 160years at the time of her death.?
This statement appears almost incredible.?
We believe there are no well authenticated
cases of greater longevity than from 120 to
130 years.

months ago, a n< gro woman in the neighborhood,
died at the age of one hundred and ibrty
years.

LATEST FROM BUENOS AYRES AND MONTEVIDEO.
By an arrival at Boston, Buenos Ayres papers
tothe20 h of June, and a letter to the
23d, have been rec ived. Also, a letter from
Montevideo of the 24th. These letters detail
the progress of events in mose coumriw III UL/ II
more intelligibly, and even fully, than the
newspapers. So cri ical was the state of things
at Buenos Ayres, that the papers had beco.ue
estremely cautious.
The U. S. sloop Independence sailed from
Mon evideo June 23 for Rio Jancrio, and the
Fairfield for Buenos Ayres on tho 25th, all

By order of General Lopez* Governor of
Cordova, the Unitarian chief, Pedro Nolasco
Rodriguez, formerly Provincial Governor of the
same State was shot at Conception on the 21st
of May, under a charge of high treason. It
will be seen, also, that Domingo Cullen has
probably shared the same fate.

Buenos Ayres, June 23, IS39.
We have rumors of the removal of the
blockade and bombardment of this city evrry
day : but, as yet, the French have not donn
any thing beyond the blockade of the city and
coast, except the burning of some coasting
vessels at the Attalaya, a small r ver that it
about half-way from this to Point Indigo; ant)
they would not have taken this hostile step
but for the belief that among twenty-three
vessels at that time there, some were fitting
out for privateers, which was not the case, ad
all were vessels that had run the blockade, and
landed their cargoes. This trade had been
continued for the year past from MontevL
deo, but this step, and some confiscations o,
tho Montevideo Government, have entirely
stopped the intercourse with Montevideo. We
have frequent arrivals of small vessels of ight
draught of water, which run into the small
rivers, and cl *ar out again to Brazil. The late
arrival at Montevideo of several vessels of wai
fr?tni France, with sailors and troops, and the
recent more vigilant look-out kept by the
French, rather tend to the belief that the past
lenient blockade is to be abandoned.
The present Governor of Buenos Ayres ha?
under his command 15,000 troops, besides mi
litia, and any attempt to invade the countr)
will be usel. ss. The troops are all horsemen
