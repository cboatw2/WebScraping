THE SOUTHERN' BAPTIST CONVEN
- -.TION
To their Brethren in the United States ;to the
congregations connected with the respective
churchds;. and to all candid meth
A-painful division has taken place in th
M ssionary. operations of the ,American
Baptists We would explain the origin,
the princples am4the objects of that di.
vision, or the peculiar. crcumstances in
which- the.oarganization.of the: -Southern
Baptist Conventiodi became necessary.
Lei not the extent of this'disunion be
exaggerated. " At the. present ume it in
volve .only the Foreign: and Domestie
lissions of the denomination.. Northern
and Southein-Baptists .are still brethren.
They differ in no a'rticle of tite faith. They
are guided by the same.principles ot gos
pel order. Fauaticaf!temps.have iddeed
been matide, ip some, quarters, Ito .exclude
us.of Iie South: from christian fellowship.
We do ntit retort These attempts;.andihe
lieve their extent to be comparatively Jim
ited.,. Qur chri tian fellowship is .not, as
we-feel, a matter to he obtruded on any
one. We abide by that of our God, his
dear Son; and all his baptised follutwers
The few ultra Northern brethren to whom
we allude.. must take what. course they
please. Their conduct has not influenced
its in- th movement. We do not regard
;the.srbtotre "r. extendipg .to fo'aidatidu
principles, nor can wethink that the great
body-of-our Northern. Brethren will so re
gard.it. Disunion has proceeded,. how
ever,.deplorably far., - The first: part of
our dutyis to show that its origin is with
others.' This.is its history..,
f. The General Convention of the Bali
tist denomination of the United States was
composed of lirethren from every part of
the Aterican Republic. Its constitution
knows no difference between slaveholders
and non-slaveholders. Nor during the pe
rind of its existence for the last thirty years
has it, in practice, known any thing of this
distinction. Both parties have contribrted
steadilj and largely (if never adequately)
to those funds which are the basis of its
constituency ; both have yielded .its.office
hearers of ail grades; its missionaries and
translators of God's word, its men of toils
many, and of prayers not unavailing.
abroad and at home. ,Tbe honoreip!
of bothiese clag'bas e iWrlk d in clo
sest sympathy with each other; anticipa
ring in the Board room and in the month
ly Concert, that higher, but not holier un
ion now in their case consummated.
Throughout the entire management of its
early af'airs, the whole struggle with its
early ditlieulties, there was no breath of
discord between them. Its Richard Fur
tan and its William Steughton, its Jesse
Mercer. and. its Thotmas Baldwin led on
the sacrimeital host ihoulder to shoulder.
and heart to heart. Their rivalry being
only in earnest eltlris fora common cause,
their entire aversions anti enmtities were
directed with all the strength of their
souls. agrinst the common foe And to
the last, did they not cherish the long he.
lief that they left ni other enmities or
aversions ; no other rivalry. to their sue
cessor, ?
In particular, a special rule of the con.
stitutiou defines who may he missionaries.
viz: "Such persons only as are in full corn
munion with some church in our denoi-i
lion, and K ho furnish atisfactory evidence
of genuine piety. Good talents, and ferve.I
zeal for the Retdeeme-r's cause." Now,
w hile under this rate the slaveholder has
been,.in his turn, ettimployed as a mission
ary, it is not alleged tiat any other' per
soits that those above described,. have been
aptpointed. Motreover1hle -iinportanti posi
of a souperintentdeti of the educan~tiotn of1
native missionairies htas beeti asigtied,
with universal approbation, to the pastor of
one of our largest slaveholding churches.
But an evil hour arrived. Even oumr
humble efforts in the cotnquest of the w.orld
to God excited the accuser of our breth
ren to cast dliscord amoing us; attd in the
last two Triennial Cunventionis, slavery
and anlti slave~ry men began to draw ofi
oin difierent sides. How did the noblem
spirits on eachi side endeavor to meet this!
They proposed and carried aitmost utnani
mously, the following explicit resolution:
"Resotved, That in co operating to
gether, as me.mbers of this Conventiotn irl
thd work of foreign missions, we disclaim.
all sanction, either expressed or implied,
whether of slavery or anti-slavery ; but as
individuals, we are free to express atnd tc
proimote, elsenherd,our views on these
subjects, itn a christian manner and spirit.'
Our successors will find it dimfiuh tc
believe that so irniportant and plain a dec.
1a~ation had hecomne, before the close al
the first year of tho trietnnial period, a per
fect tnullity. in December last the acting
Board of the Convention, at Boston, adop
teed a tiew qualificatioii for missionaries, a
new special rule, viz-that "If aniy oat
who shall off'er himsaelf for a missionar)
having slaves, sho'dd insist on retaining
them as his property, they could nor ap
point him.!' "One thing is certain,"they
continue, "~We could never be a party tc
any arrange..,ent which implies approba
tion of slavery"
We pray our Brethren and all candid
men to mark the date of this novel rule
the close of the first six months of theim
three years' power, a ~late at which the
Coni promise resolution could scarcelj
have reached our remioter Missio" sta
tions. If ustirliation had bteen intended
could it hav~e beeni more fitly timiedi AC
usurpatin of ecclesiastical power quite
suined at a period when the aggrieved
"thousands of Israel," has, as it, now an
pearsd. npractical remedy. Its 'obvious
tendenc was, either our final subjugation
to that :wer, or a serious interruption of
the fliw'of Southern. benevolence. The
latter'wasthe far more probable evil; and
the Boslan Board knew this well. They
were from various quarters apprised of it.
_-We, -n-the other hand, did not move in
the matt of a new organization until three
liberal ies had refused to send North
ward de, more contribitpious. Our lead
ers had' ch'sen new rules. Thus came
war within our gates ; while the means of
war on -the common enemy were daily di
iniisihtg..
By this.decision the Board -had placed
itself in direct oppositiob to the Codstitu
tion'of-the Convention., The only reason
given forthis extraordinary and unconsti
tutiontaI etum being-that A The ap
pointing'iwer for wise and good purposes,
is confidad to the' acting Board." On
such a.slight show of authority, this Board
undertook to declare that to be a disqual
ificatioi'ih one who should offer himself for
a Missionary, whichthe Convention had
saidshall.not a be disq'ualification.. It had
also expr4psly given its sanction to Anti
slavery.opidions, and impliedly fixed its
coudemnaiion on slavery, although the
conv'e'tiion =had said that "neiither;".should
he done. And further it forbade those who
.shall app.lf for a. Missionary appointment
to -.express and promnte elsewhere" their
views onlhe subject of slavery in a right
"manner pand spirit." when the constitu
tion.decla'd they "were free" to do so.
These brfihren, thus acted upon a senti
ment th 'fave failed to prove-Thatsla
very, ' an -all. circumstances sinful.
Whereas their :own solemn Resolution in
the last4Oonvebtion (their's as much as
ours) left Cwee'to promote slavery. Was
not this ' 'us free, and "in a Chris
tian spin manner" to promote that
which in thir hearts, and according to the
present shtwing.of their conduct, they re
garats asin 1.
Thoujh; perhaps, has been said of the
origin oftahis.movement. Were we asked
to chiara erize the conduct of our northern
brethren in. one short phrase we should
adopt tihat sf the -Apostle. It was "FOR
DIDDING Us'to speak UNTO THE GEsTILEs.'
Did it not opstruct ut, lay adkind of fR'
ansliio et u on us in the dischag cf
'rimp~ uye uy' a'duty-to which the
church has been, after the lapse of ages,
awakened universally and successfully;
a duty the very object, and only object, of
our long cherished connection and confed
eration ?
And this would seem the place to state,
that our Northern brethren wore dealt
With as brethren to the last moment.
Several of our churches cherished the hope
that by means of remonstrance and ex
posiulation, through the last Annual Meet
ing of the Board of Managers at Provi
dlence, the Acting Board might be brought
to feel the grievous wrong-they had in
flirted. - The Managing Board was there
fore affectionately and respectfully ad
lressed on thesuhheft, and was entreated to
revise aiid reverse the obnoxious interdict.
Alas! the resulis were--conutemptuous si
lence as to the application made; and a
dlelib'rate resolve. expressing sympatlhy
with the Actina Board, and a deterrmina
tion to sastain them.
Il. The Principles of the Southern
Baptisi Convenoton it remains ihen to be
stated, are conservative; while they are
also, as we trust, equitable and liberal.
They propose to do the Lardi's work in the
way our fathers did it. Its title designates
at once its origin and the simple, firm abi
ding of 'the South' on the ground from
whicti it has been so uuconstitutionally and
atnjusily attempted to ejeci us. WVe have
but enqu~tireda for, "'the old paths'.' of .Mis
signary operatiotas; 'asked' for,and attem p
teal to restore the practically 'good way.'
Thue Constitutiona we adopt is precisely
that of the original union; that in coannec
tion with whaicth, throughout his Missionary
life, Andoniraml Juadson has lived, and
under whtich Ann Judson anid Boardman
ha died. .We recede from it..no single
step). We have c'ons'ructed for our ,basis
no new creed; acting in this matter upon
a Baptist aversion from all creeds but the
Bible. We use the very terms as wye
uphold the true spirit and great object of
the late 'General Convention of the Bap
aist denomination of the United Stetes.'
It is they who wronged us that have rece
ded. We have receded neither from the
Constitutioni nor from any part of the orig
inal ground on-'which we mei them in this
work. And, if we ask in parting, the
otigintal sand broad Bible ground of Con'
federation were not 'equitable, howv came
it so nobly anid so long to be acted upon"
If equitable, why depart from it ?
WVe claim to have acted in the premi.
ses with liberality towards our Naorthern
brethren. Thraust fromt the commaron plat
form of equal rights bet wveen the Northern
and Sou'her'nLeherches, we have but re
constructed that platform. Content ws ith
it, we adhere to i1, and reproduce it. as
broad enough for us anad for them. Have
they thrust us off? WVe retain but one
feeling in ia ecase ,Tha2 we will not prac.
tically leave it on any account : much less
in obedience to such 'usurped authority, ot
in deference to such a manifest breach of
trust as is here inv'olved. - A breach o1
covenant that looks various ways-beav
enwaird and earthivarai. For we repeat.
Lhey would forbid tus to speak unto the
-Genfiles.. Thae Jerusalem church, then.
mnust be rvgather'ed at thie suspeeted Sa
Imaria, or at somea new ceantre oroperations:
life A ntioch. -'One thine is cortain"
We must go every where preaching 'the
word , "We can never be a party to any
arrangement" for monopolizing the Gos
pel : any arrangement which like that of
the Autocratical Interdict of the: North,
would first drive us from our. beloved col
ored people. of whom they prove that
they know nothing comparatively, and
from the much wronged Aboriginds-of the
country:-and then cut us-off from the
whitening fields of the Heathen harvest
labor; to. which by cogent appeals and
solemn prayers, they have so often protes
ted that, with, us, they were inadequate.
I.Il' Our OBJECTS, then, are the exten
dion of the Messiah's kingdorn, and the
glory'of our God. Not~disuiiian 'with any
of his people; not 'the upholding of any
form of human polity, or civil rights; but
God's' glory, and Messiah's increasing
reign ; in the promotion of which,' we find
no necessity for relinquishing any of our
civil rights. We will never interfere
with what is Casars* We will not com
promit what- is God's.
These objects will appear in detail on
the face of our Constitution, and in the
proceedings, which accompany this' ad
dress. They are distributed at present, be
tween two acting Boards for Foreign and
Domestic Missions, having their respect
ive seats at Richmond, Va., and Marion,
Ala. We sympathize with the Macedo
uian cry from every part of the Heathen
world,-with the low moan. for spiritual
aid, of the four millions of' half stifled Red
Men,' our neighbors; with the sons of
Etiopia among us, stretching forth their'
hands of supplication for the gospel, to
God and 'all his people,-and we have
shaken ourselves from the night mare of
a sit years' "strife about words to' no
profit," for the profit of these poor,' perish
ing and precious souls. Our language to
all America, a~td to all 'Chrisrendon, if
they will hear us, is "come over," and for
these objects, as ye have' souls. and the
divine Saviour of. souls, "help us." We
have had more talk than work about
these objects too long. We have waited
quite too long-for the more learned and
gifted, and opulent and worthy, to lead our
way towards these objects; and we have
shortened debate upon them to get to bu
siness. Our eyes and .hearts are turned
with feelings of patental fondness to the
B.urmah and the Karens; with a zeal in,
which we are willing to 6~ counselled by,
God and all considerate men (but by none
else)-to the continent of. Africa, and her
pernicious fountains of idolatry. oppres
sion and blood; but yet more, with uuut
terable hope and' thankfulness, to .China
and her providentially opened ports and
teeming thirty millions. i Among us, in
the South, we have property, which we.
will offer to the Lord' and his cause, in
these'channels-some prudence with which
we would have our best wisdomf to dwell;
a. d professions of a piety which we seek'
to have increased and purified. like that
of the first Baptist churches, when they
had "rest ; and walking in the fear of the
Lord,and in the comfort of the Holy
Ghost, were multiplied."
In parting with' belofed brethren' and
old coadjutors in this caue,nw e could weep,
and have wept, for ourselves and for them ;
but the season, as well of weeping as of
vain jangling, is we are constrained to be
lieve, just now past. For years the pres
sure of men's hands, has been upion us far
too heavily:. Our brethren' have pressed
upon ever' inch of our privileges and our'
sarred rights---but this shall only urge our'
gushing souls to yield proportionately of
their renewed efforts to the Lord, to the
church universal. and to a dying world;
even as water pressed from without rises
bu the more within. Above all the noun
tain pre-sure, of our obligations to God'
even our own 'God; 'to Christ and to
Him crucified;i and to the personal and
eocial blessings of the Holy .Spirit and 'his
influences, shall urge our little. streams of
the 'vater of life to flow forth';. until every
wvilderness atnd desolate place withilaour
reach (atnd wvhat extent of .the world's wvil
derness, wisely :considered 'is' not within
oor reach ?) 'shall he -glad'-.even at thiu
passing calamity of division ; 'andt the'des
erts of the unconverted human nature 're
joice and blossorr as the rose."
By order of-the Convention.

What is said- in the.subjoited aricle'of
the profession of the Law, is equallf true
in reference to that .of 'Medicine-and'ii
is lamentbly bbt too true in regard to
both. '.Every State almost in the Ugion,
has: from one to three 'Medicatl foleges.
where": oung .metn are. tak a 'iti"' and
" turned' oui" annually as it:by'machie
ry'-:oe0, two, tree, and even four lin
dred at. a time. These men, armed Wvitr
their Iaicets :and p'ill boxes, crowd every
-city, town and'hamlet in'the-land Mariy
of them of fine intellects and attainments,.
are doomed to drag out a miserable exi
tencesfur years before they can realize
even a, reasonable compeience from their
professional pursnits. Others less firm
and: persevering, "yield 'tc the etimptations
which surround them,' and become.profes-:
sional loafers or :vagabonds;' A few -on y
are eminentlysuccessful.' $uch a state of
things- is' well' calculated to awaket the -
attention of pareits-and guardians to the,
causes of the evil. Why is it that young
men will close -their eyes to facts, and
desert ot her respectable pursuits to choose
a life of such almost certain poverty' and
dependence? It' is because they =are
averse to' honest labor, or because-they
court the kind of quasi respectability which
a professional position entitles thetm to in
society-? If either, they are not to-fie V
envied in their lean and beggarly copdi
lion-their fancied aristocacy-their pre
fessional. torpidity. We have at this
moment in our eye two men -who' com-.
titeoced their career in life dootemporane
ously. 'The one, of brilliant powers, of
estimable character; of rich and respecta
ble connexions. The. other, of'moderato
endowments and pretensious, the son-ofa
poor widow.' The former *as attracted
by tlie. show 'add promise-.of prpfes'sional.
life, the litter was content to'be'boundn "
apprentice to an industrious tradesman:
The one is now a loafidg, vagabond gaini
bIer; while the' po'or apprentice boy is the.
holder 'of about iwo hundred .thousand
dollars' worth of real estate in the-city of
Philadelphia-a respectable, influential
member of the: community -in which he'
lives.' The diff'ereice in theircircumstan
ces so far as' ht maniy"cen discern, is
attributable'solely to the difference in their
:chice of pursuits. - I'be one was iranmed'
to industry and frugality while-the other,.
compelled to keep up appearances in gen
reel circles, was forced t6 the hazards of
the game, and .finally ruined The-case
here menti'ohed' is but one ofthe rmany
which every. reflecting' man'e experience
will attest as being only too common an
the land. :We'allude to it'not for the pur-.
pose of reflecting upot either.of the learn
ed professions, whose members generally
are entitled to great respect o account of
both their. intellectual and moral attain
ments ; it is .referrcd' :o only''for thd'pu.
pose of co'rrecting that perverted ipublic'
taste which is at present driving hundreds'
of our young men to destruction, through
the high way of the professions - -
.In ur.own city, how few yduth, com-'
paratively, 'direact their' auention to the
nehlanic and oiher similar pursuits?
How 'few' have selected the vild and ad-'
venttirous life of the sailor to seek by in
dustry;.the respectable anti responsible po
sitions of masters and' males in. out mer
chant vessels ? In all our efterisive ac
quaintance, we know of but two or three
instances 'in the last few years, of young
men who have had firmn'ess.'euoughto
brave ' the dangers of the sea rather than
remain in.idlenessat home.' Such exam
ples deserve: to be made liiu'rable men:
tion of. The great commercial 'and'mari
time, of the country demand tba our ships
shtnuld'be both lofficered and ' mamled by
the right sort of men. E very'Sate-'ever
ry seaport' at -least, should furnisiwitipre
portion' of thosti.who' are's to conduct an'd
defend the 'commerce -"or the -country.'
Congress should make provisloon bislair
foi- th'e nire intiinate blending of'our
commercial and naval'interests. As'in
England, all our'tmail steamers thightbe
officered by persons holding coamissibus
in the riavy.. .Provisin might also be
mrade for the easy trdnsfeiof tmen of tried -
ch'aracter and approsed'acquirements front
our commercial vessels to the uavy tnrtime
of war. '
'Such a provision IVoIld add 'respecta
bliity to the character'of the sea'-farer; it
would oisen 'a wide 'field of' eroplojynent
to the youth of the land i-i tise of'peade.
it' would add to our security in times of.
confliit ith other'powors-and above all,
it would draw'offthundreds of-artibitions
young men, whio' 'are otherwise -de'sttned
to drag out a miserable existerich in tire
learned 'professions. Whio will rlo'vd 'in
the matter?
" Poor, but Honest."-The hewspip'jers
and other egnally great auaitoities, make
use of'this'phrase in biographical notices,
-'he was horn of:'poorbut honeus'parents!"
Poor, but honest ; that is' to. infer that- thc'
parents ought to havee been "dishonest'
beca-use they were. poor, buts that dn -the
particular case, thiey-were honest, spite of'
their, poverty. This comnmbn phurase is an
insult' to the condition of ninety nine men
out a hundred, and an indig'oty to huinan
naturet There mitght be, considering-the
mnanner io which many rot-tunes are. ac
quired, some little shade of meaning ini
saying' of the-..heir of fortuue, "he. was
born-gf rich-but'honest pireats;". but. the
-poor hte honest" phrase is atrocious.
Let it be4reformed altogether-Philitdel
- phid-'Ledge.
