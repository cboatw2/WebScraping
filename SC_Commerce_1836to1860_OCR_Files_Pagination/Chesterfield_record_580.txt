VERMONT. ! i
From the Message of Governor Paine, of |
Vermont to the Legislature of that State, j
now in session, we copy the following para- j
graphs, relating to the institutions and politics
of the Un on:
"The attention of the people of the whole (
Union h is been directed, by events which , J
lieve occurred within the last few yea-s, to <
certain amendments which are deemed es>eniial
in the Federal Constitution. The undue ,
stimulus to ambition which is thought to bo ,
southed by the prospect of the Presid iitial j j
iiffie befay enioved hv its occupant for a sec- j
o:i<i tern. of f.mr years, h is created great [
altnn t<?r tiie b<tUue?? of the powers of' the
General Government. Experience has cer.
taiiily proved thar. if there is any duugt-r of ?
that oalance being desiroyed, H arises from
the ecus'ant eiihr is ;:f the Execu ive department
to cxtmi i its patronage anil power.
That such eiForis have Frequently been '<
made to enable the President to secure u !
re-election, can hardly he doubled; and;
it is to lie feared that tiiev will continue '
to he too often made, so long as human
nature remains unchanged.
V general complaint, arising from the :
same well-grounded apprehension, exists !
as to the President's power of removal
from ofiiee. The ('onstitutiori directly '
gives him no such power, hut he has heen j
allowed to take it by implication, 11 is 1
difficult to imagine ho;v it should ever i
have been derived from that provision in J
the Constitution which authorizes him !
to nominate, and by and with the advice
and consent of the Senate to appoint"
all odicors.
"Tut; President and Senate are jointly
tnade the appointing power, and, /in the j
absence of all other provisions on the 1
subject, one would have supposed they J
must aUo be jointly the removing power. !
But the President claims to exercise it j
alone, and more frequently exercises it j
without any cause, except for the politi,
cal opinions of those removed, than from ;
an impartial regard to the faithful per
formauee of the public service, which
forms the sole argument in favor of Us
ex.stance. For if the Constitution designed
to give such a power to the Presi- ;
dent, it must have boon for the purpose ;
of enabling him to make removals requi- j
1 red !>v the public good. Hut it has been i
t
j perverted to a totally din rent purpose ?
that of enabling hnn to reward Ins sup- j
porters, strengthen his iufluuuco, and so- j
cure 'lis own re-election.
Another similar subject, to wiiicli I
would invite your particular attention, is
the power of the Power of the President
to veto which have been passed by both
I Houses of Congress. This is the only
monarchical feature in our form of gov-!
eminent, and it isdiliicult to understand
how it should ever have boon engrafted j
upon republican institutions. It wa's '
I probably taken, without much redaction j
us to its consequences, from the British j
Constitution, which vests u similar power j
in the King, out only to protect his own !
i prerogative from encroachment. Even
! for this purpose, however, it has not been
j exercised i?y him for more than two cenj
turios. 'l\ie early settlers of Vermont !
j were too jealous ef l;l>?;rt y to allow such n 1
i power any place in our Constitution,
j form a just notion of the magniJ
turle of the veto power, ns it may he ex- ;
, ercised by the President, we must keep
: constantly in view that to prevent the
' passage of wholesome and necersnry laws
' is as bad as to pass those which are inisj
chievous. The power to make all laws
1 might he as properly entrusted to the
j President as the power to prevent all j
' laws. The history of all legislation 1

sist the enactment of such laws ns he
j pleases, unless passec by so large a majority,
is in effect to reposu in one man ;
almost the entire power of legislation.? 1
! But the President not only claims the
rioiit to exercise the veto power whenev

A letter has been received from Leip

Gabriel Stockner, a mechanician of
hat city, has just finished an Electro
Magnetic Locomotive, the greatest pert
>f which is constructed after Mr. Wngler's
plan, and which has been purchased
>y the Germanic Diet. This locomotive
s of seven horse power, and will draw
hree cars full of passengers. It costs
ibout $1,000, instead of $7,500, the cost
)f a common steam locoruotire; the sup)ly
for it amounts to not more than 60
rents per day.
The experiments which have been
nade with Mr. Stock.er's locomotive on

We fully concur with the Mercury,
The nomination of Judge O'Nenll is a

that Judge O'Noall will not permit

Our estimable friend, Dr. Moore, Cashier
of the Branch Rank in this piacer politely
shewed us yesterday, some remarkably
rich specimens of ore from a Vein
Mine lately commenced in Union District,
about twelve miles above the Court
House, called Nott's Mine. In three or
four small pieces of rock there were estimated
to be fifty to seventy dollars worth
of gold ; and among them was a piece of
solid gold in its natural state, worth twenty-five

The last Temperance A lcocrtte, in
stating the result of the late election for
Colonel, pays the following just and well,
merited tribute t<? the sterling worth of
litis estimable officer and gentleman,
whose wlioln character reflects thb highest
credit on the noble example, of an
honored and respected'aire, who has long
made his name almost synonimous with
rigid honesty and integrity, and modest
and unassuming devotion to lite public
good. _ , .
' Richland District ha.^ reason to he
proud of this high-minded and honorable 2
young officer. It bus long been said,
that a candidate in Richland District
must treat to liquor, or lose Ills elect h*n?
in other words, must resort to bribery, or
he defeated. Cnpt Gregg, however, with
a purity of principle and moral firmness,
that reflect ten-fold more honor on him
than tho official distinction he has gained,
determined to run simply on his own
merits as a gentleman and an officer?
scorning office if he had to creep into it
through tin* low and degrading path of
treating and bribery, fie did not run as

announced his determination to treat no

adhered to,'and old Richland has shown
that she can appreciate and honor the
man who has the virtue and rnornl courage
to act the high-minded gentleman, in an
Rlection canvass, as well as in the nocial
circle. Wc hope the day is not distant*
