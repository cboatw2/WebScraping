accomplishments have been rendered fa'
move by Mr. Wirt'a eloquent description
in kit defence of her budMnd. He repre
aented her as * beautiful as a Uouri, anc
gifted as Zobeide."
Her husband* a wealthy Irish emigrant
shared the political opinions of Rober
Emmet, and is said to have left Ireland t<
avoid bis fete. He bought an estate 01
Bacchus Island, in the broad Ohio, 01
which ho expended $56,000. It bees mi
renouned for the elegance of the mansion
the tasteful arrangement of the grounds
and the loveliness of the scenery. It wai
described as a luxurious retreat, whicl

Not OfM the ruins of this once famou
plece srenow remaining. In an evil hour
one An# spring morning, Aaron Burr Ian
ded on that beautiful Island, and sent hi
servant with the following note:
" Colonel Burr eoliciU the favor of be
in* permitted to teandetutmona the ground
. of mre. iHannerhaOmT
This, of course, received a courteoui
answer, and the acquaintance thus begun
involved the hospitable emigrant in th<
treasonable designs of his insidious guest
A military force took possession of tin
island, burnt the splendid house and fur
nitnro. destroyed the beautiful gardens
and drove the once happy family int<
exile*
The following account, from the Lick
ing Valley Register, Kentucky, is givei
by one who knew them in their prosperity
Much has been said and written on th
conspiracy of Aaron Burr; and a diversi
ty of opinion still exists, as to the exteri
or trio designs. The elegant retiremen
of Blannerhaaeet, previous to his associa
tion with Burr, has also been a theme c
eloquence and a subject of admiration
As I lived near the centre of Butr'sopc
rations, and was intimate with the famil
of Blannerhassett, many facts came un
tier my observation which perhaps are no
generally known. 1 therefore compl;
with year request by detailing circctmetar
tea which ware familiar to me at that pc
viod. , i ' >;
.With reference (o Burr's conspiracy,
haute nover doubted the Tact, that his firs
nlpjl vM a separation of the Slates, so
the establishment of "an energetic gov
. eminent," including our north west am
southwestern territories. This intentioi
was clearly manifested by a series of pub
lioatione with the signature of "Quss
ist," in the M Ohio Gazette," a paper ther
printed at Marietta, by one Fairlamb.
Thoee numbers held forth all the argu
ments that could bo urged, to induce tht
withdrawal of the Weat and 8outh fronr
the old States. Burr furnished the Iced
iag points, Blannerhasaett wrote them out
and attended to their publication. Th<
first number was read to the printer, bj
Bhmossbanoett, at my fbther's house, am
in the praaaneeof several of the family
After the printer had retired my fat he
tnade a strong appeal to Mr. Blannerhns
sett, on the folly and danger of such ai
enterprise; reminding him of his narrov
escape from the troubles of Ireland, of th<
nnhappy form of gorernment he then en
joyed, and of his delightful situation a
the bland, surrounded with alUhe source
of earthly blias. Mr. Blaanerhaasett wa
disconcerted j be acknowledged hie ob
ligations for my father's friendly motives
but attributed their different views to dil
ference of age. My father indignant!;
replied that be had fought for the Govern
ment under which he lived, that he lovoi
it as the apple of his eye, and that treasoi
against it could not be concerned unde
his roof. Mr. BUnnerhassett politel;
withdrew, took up his quarters at a pub
lie house, and never made his home witl
us afterwards. But number after numbe
of the "Qubuist," caarte before the pee
pie, bidding forth the possession of th<
public lands, with all their mineral pro
dwetiens?the great agricultural prospect
of the ,Weet?the vast navigable water
? the occupation of New Orleans as i
commercial emporium, and various othc
arguments in favor of a separate govern
ment. A day was also sppointod to hol?
a convention nt the island.
Bat the plans of Burr were not confi
nod to the separation of the States; hi
know that this project might fail, and thi
establishment of an empiro in tho Mexi
can country was his alternative, a num
her of batteaax, or row-gs(lies, were pre
pored on tho Muskingum river, and pro
osblr seme at Other nointa. with wki.l
he intended a rapid descent on New Or
leans, or to ascend the Red river toward*
Mexico, aa circumstances might require.
Number* of reetieM and desperate spirit!
wnro enlisted in his visionary schemes,
from Pittsburg to Now Orleans bet the
mas* of the western people were attached
,,to their government, and their connections
east of the mountain*. If the cono
vantion bad assembled at the island, the
- Inhabitant* of the neighbourhood were
' prepared to disperse them with force and

a apeela} law of Ohio, paaaerl for Iba occa.

Burr mot .in council with a fragment of
his bilowori, on an island in tho Missis,
sippi. where hia ocheme was abandoned.
He fled in disguise but waa arrested, tried
at the city of Richmond, and acquitted by
a quirk of the law.' Blannerhassett and
other associate* wcro discharged. His
family, sorvantsand fbrniturc, having do*
scended the river to Notches, he located
himself on a cotton farm in that vicinity,
' The ombargo and the war which follow,
i ed, defeated his expectations; he became
embarrassed; his fortune having been
i impaired by hi* liabilities for Burr. Un
der the prospect of a civil appointment in
. Lowor Canada, he removed to Montreal,
| but his friend, the governor, being remov.
. ed, he wee again disappointed, and retired
, at last to the Island of Jersey, in the Brit.
iah channel, where his maiden sister resiI
ded, a lady of fortune. There he died the
victim of a romantic and visionary mind.
t Blnnnerhasactt was an Irish nobleman,
t a man of science, and a polished gentle9
man. He excelled in the composition
i and performance of music; his instruft
ments were the violin, and bass-viol, both
b of which he used in tho manner of the
i, bass. His spacious hall was constructed
it in musical proportions, where the tones of
a his viol vibrated with thrilling effect. His
i library was elegant and extensive, his laD
boratory was provided with abundant apparatus
for chemical and philosophical exa
pcrimonts, and his houso and gardens
, were furnished with various means of win.
ter and summer amusements. Tho mana
sion, with its corridor and wings, formed
half an ellipsis, and the finish and furniture
of its apartments were adapted to the
use for which they were intended. The
r hall was a spacious, lofty room, its walls
painted a sombre color, and its furniture
i rich, heavy, and grand. The drawing
i room was in perfect contrast, and its dec>
orations light as a fary's wing. In short
At : L _ a - as* ...

3 genteel, without the glare of tinsel finery,
. or the inconsistency of bad taste. His
i, style of living was in unision with his
> house and furniture, always elegant, easy
and comfortable. The arrangements of
. the grounds was equally complete, the
11 famous shrubery was a mimic wilderness,
: with labyrinth walks bordered with flow,
e era, and interspersed with arbors and i
i- grottos. The extensive pastures in front,
it with its flocks and herds, was separated
t from the lawn by an invincible fenco;
i. and the view upon tho Ohio was obstruc*
if ted for several miles. But the whole
i. scene requires the pen of a poet. The
>. description of Wirt is nearer the reality
y than is generally believed, and his sketch
i. of Mrs. Blannerhassett is equally true to
>t nature. She was a beautiful, and accom.
y plished lady, of dignified appearance and
i. manners; affable, friendly, and witheut
i. the least affectation, vet with all her elegance,
she was a noble housewife, and dol
voted to her needlo; not in the producit
tion of flowers and flounces, but of gard
ments for her children and servants.
. The miserable slanders which have been
j reported of her, are without the least
n foundation. Burr did not seduce Blan.
nerhassett, through the medium of his
. wife, as has often been stated; his only
i visit to the island did not exceed threo
days; and no woman of Mrs. Blannerhas.
sett's mind and character, could be cor.
i rupted on so brief an acquaintance. Blan.
\ nerhassett was an open and unguarded
. man, easily imposed upon nnd enthusias*
t tic in all his impulses. Burr approached
j him in the most artful and insidious man*
r ner. Descending the river in a batUaux,
i ho landed as a passing stranger merely to
. see and admire the far.famcd island. Mr.
r Blannerhassett hearing that a stranger
. was on his lawn sent a servant to invite
it him to the house; the wily serpent aont
r his card with an apology, but Mr Blannera
haasett with his usual hospitality walked
. out and insisted on his remaining a day
t or two. Burr very modestly acquiesced,
s and during that unfortunate interview,
a infused the poison of ambition into the
u unwary mind of his visionary hoAt. Mrs.
i, Blannerhassett endeavoured to dissuade
f- her husband Irom the enterorise. hut finrt.
f hiii foul enlisted in it, her sense of duty
. compelled her to acquiesce in his views,
d which resulted in the ruin of his family.

THE ACADEMY BUILDINGS.
TflE Cheraw Academical Society is now in
debt about #1600. Since its establishment it
has expended, for lots, buildings, and repairs,
about #5000; besides large sums of money in
making up to teachers from time to time deficiencies
in their salaries, arising from inadequate
receipts for tuition. Though the
Society has heretofore received considerable
aid from citizens and otbors not members; yet
the principal burden and the whole reeponsi.
bility (previous to last year) has always rested
on those who tcere. The Society now
consists of few in number ; and at a meeting
convened this day, it was resolved to sell the
Academical Lots and Buildings for the purpose
of paying the above debt; unless some
measures are promptly adopted by the community
to discharge tne same. Most, perhaps
all, the members of the Society are understood
to be willing to co-operate with their follow
citizens in inn matter ; but they are not diepoeed
to do it without their assistance..
The 16th day of next month is fixed for
delerming upon the sale ; unless, before that
I date, the peoplo (with such arguments as sat1
isfy creditors) put their veto upon it.
By order of the Academical Society,

monies which accompany the volume, we should
say, it may sufely be surrendered to their bauds."
