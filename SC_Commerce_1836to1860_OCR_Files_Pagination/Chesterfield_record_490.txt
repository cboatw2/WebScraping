surprise, the first part of a stalk I rut up,
I I fojnd six catterpillars snugly housed in
the pethofthe stalk. - This discovery led
me to an examination of at least some fifty
or more stalks, when to my astonishment
I found the worms, some eight or ten
in every stalk, and nearly all alive. My
plan is, to destroy these lo^crx of cotton
| immediately, and ihe only effectual mode
that I know of, is to burn-the s'alks. You
smuldset about it immediately, say the first
rain, pulling up your stalks to he burnt,
before the catterpillar should eat itself out,
in the shape of a butterfly perhaps, or some
other insect, ready to deposit its egg as
soon as your cotton should begin to form
squares or bolls. By adopting the above
plan, thousands and tens of thousands
may he destroyed, which will remove entirely,
in my opinion, the greatest difficulty
in making a crop of cotton. But, perhaps
some farmers may conclude, that as
planters generally plant corn after cotton,
it will m ike no material difference as to
Iturninnr tho&'aSks. But stop: let me ask
you if you are certain that the chinch bug
* is not a production of this very caiterpillar;
and besides that, many farmers, notwithstanding
they adopt the rotation plan
of forming, are necessarily compelled to
plant some cotton in the same field twice,
and perhaps thrice in succession? You will
excuse the dress, Mr. Editor, in which this
article appeals, as mv object is simplv to
elicit a degree of attention to this matter,
and to draw forth from those more experienced
than myself, information which will
elevate the science of agriculture to a
elation which it deserves.

Striate follows: If 19. I am sure, painfully
within the recollection of the Senate
that, a few dnvs since, a vrrv unpleasant
collision occurcd on this floor between
the Senator from Kentucky and the Senator
from Alabama. Any interruption of
the habitual and characteristic harmony
of litis laxly,or the parliamentary decorum
of its proceedings, is, under any circumstances,
.deeply to be regretted; but especially
in the present case, inasmuch as
the manifestation of heatoccurcd between
Senators of such long and distinguished
O r?
standing. It might well be supposed that
nothing but mistake or accident could
have led to such a result; and thorougly
convinced of this, I rise, Mr. President,
to state my conviction of the existence of
misapprehension, and to state succinctly
the moJe in which it occured.
On the occasion alluded to, the Senator
from Kentucky, couceiving that the remarks
of the Senator from Alabama were
calculated ?nd intended to be injurious to
bis character, and personally offensive,
rotortcd in language of direct Affront?
language which 1 am convinced he could
rot have employed but under a deep sense
of injury. In this view of the remarks
of the Senator from Alabama, I believe
he was mistaken. Indeed I am convinced,
from information which has casually come
to my possession, that tho Senator iroin
Alabama dit not intend Jo be personally
offmsive. At the bottom of this nffiir,
therefore,. ihere is a misapprehension,
which I announce with pleasure, and in
the confi! ?nt belief tint, being annojncod,
the honorable aivl distinguished
St.i:mtAr<s will nermit no formal (litlicultv
to arrest a;i adjustment which is earnestly
demanded?"-by the Senate an 1 the conntry.
Mr. Clav said he shared with thr Senator
from South Carolina, Mr Preston, in
the regret which he had manifested, on
account of the occurence, disturbing the
usual harmony and good feeling which
prevails in the Senate, to which ho had
ailuded; and he bore with pleasure testimony
to the honorable and high-minded
feelings which had prompted that Senator
to make the appeal which ho had just
presented.
Before he, MrC., proceeded to respond
particulany to that appeal, he wished to
Fubmit a few general obsenatious to the
Senate in regard to the privileges of Congressional
or Parliamentary debate.
Kvery Senator had the most perfect
right to speak with the utmost freedom
o, those who were in power; ho might denounce
them as arbitrary, wick?l, and
incompetent, and their measures as tyrannical,
corrupt, and ruinous to the bc-st interest9
of the country. So it was equally
right of every member to deliver his sentiments
without reserve on the character
of all }>ersons not members of the bo Iv,
hut whose names or characters were connected
with subject tin lor debate, a id til!
brought before the Senate as candidates
for appointment to office. All this a
member has a right todo under no other
rcvnonsihilil v than that which his own
conscience and public opinion impose.?
Enl while this right was clear and undeniable,
was essential to the due discharge
of official duly, and was in no case to be
restrained, the same liberty did not extend
to the language of Senators towards each
osher, or in reference to their motives. In
speaking to or of each other, the utmost
reaped and decorum ought ever to he preserved,
all personality avoided, and especially
all imputation of improper motives.
Under these impressions as to the privileges
of debate, and guided by these rules,
Mr. Cr had spoken, a few days si'ice, of
the elder editor of the Globe newsjmpcr,
whom it was then proposed to dissmiss
from the office of a printer to the Senate.
Had not that individual been thus legetimately
and directly before the body, lie
should have forborne, as he had always
hitherto, in his public station, forborne, to
say a word in regard to him or the paper
which he edits. Notwithstanding ten
"years of the most unparalleled abuse aud
?i MM???
wanton and unscrupulous attacks of himself,
Mr. C. had remained silent; and so ir
he should still have remained; but when rt
the name of that person was directly be- e<
fore the Senate, and his character and j V
conduct of a public journal became a legit- | fr
imate subject for its consideration, he had H
felt it to be bis right to speak of him in N
the terms lie had done. When, on the m
next day, the Senator from Alabama, Mr. tr
King, addressed the Senate, he must sav ir
that while that gentleman was speaking, b<
he had thought that there was, on his 01
part, a studied, a premeditated, and, as he le
I hen believed, a preconcerted design to hi
make an assault upon hitn and his charac- a;
ter. And when the Senator concluded c<
by instituting a comparison of Mr. C. to S
a man whom he had, but a day before, de- j clarcd
to he infamous, and of whom he hi
had spoken as a common libeller, and or o
his paper as libellous, he did not doubf
that his object was a personal offence !o *1
Mr. C. It was under this impression that j t'
Mr. 0. had addressed 'o the Chair f!
remarks which he intended as a deliberate I
| oflbnee to that Senator. b
| But it \va * due to the S ira'or frcn Ala- b
{ bnmi as well as to himedfto state that lit t
J had since received satisfactory i fforma
| tion. on whieh he p'aced implicit rel'nfv.p
j that tiiere had been no parpese or i-Pnn. \
lion on the part of that Senator <o off r i
any personal affront to Mr. C. or to ca 4 i
the slightest imputation on his charac'c .
or - honor. Mr. C. had thr.rcfc.re been g
mistaken as to the design which he hat' j

at all times promptly to repair an injury as
he hoped he ever should be to repel an in- h
dignity, and always taking more plca*un t<
to repair than to repel, and without any s|
regard to the nicely of mere technical I
forms, to which those acquainted with
I him well knew he never attached great a
importance?under the circumstances as |
thus explained, and with the understand- IV
ing which he now had of the real intentions n
j o! that Senator, it was with infinite pleasJ
ure he now declared every epithet in the c
i least derogatory to him, to his honor, or T
to his character, to-be withdrawn. 01
j . [This declaration elicited a spontaneous q
j burst of applause from the surrounding o
audience, who had listened with eager at- <
tention to all that had passed. The Chair,
however, interfered, and the applause was
j immediately suppressed.]
I Jfr. King said: I concur with the Sena!
O
tor from Kentucky as to the duty which !
every Senator owes to himself and to the ; P
body of which he is a member. He should p
j studiously avoid all personalities, and keep p
j himself strictly within the rules of order, j b
j and never depart from decorum in debate, j 0

j I make this statement with pleasure; for, ^

Mr. Preston stated that he could not re- j n

i upon the honorable adjustment of this j
s painful controversy. The gentlemen p
j had acted as became their high character i

The banks of Norh Carolina have again fac
nspcnded specie payments. We are not
ufticicntly acquainted with the circum- fr0|
tanees which control banking operations j anc
ithat State to say certain!y w hy her banks int,
re obligedto suspend, while the banks in a||
South Carolina pay specie. One cause may j 8ha
ethat the bank capital of North Caroilnais dea
;ssin proportion to the demand lor it than wit
a this State, and that, therefore, the 181
anks find it necessary for the accommo- Var
lation of the public, to issue a larger s]ai
mount of bills in proportion to their capi- suh
ol; which they might do without in the shi]
east endangering t e r ?ol ey. Th 8' por
ve say may be the case, we do not know By
hat it is. Another and a principle cause pas
ve suppose to be, that a large amount of not
otton is shipped from this state to New grc
fork, on which our banks realize specie, rc?
1st the amount of cotton shipped from
th Carolina is comparatively small,
irge share of the agricultural products
North Carolina is shipped from this
te and Virginia; which circumstance
rates to the disadvantage of the N.
olina banks; particularly whilst the
w York banks are paying specie, and
st of the banks south of that State are
. The North Carolina banks are con.
,?red sound, and when the present deged
state of the currency shall be corted
they wilf doubtless pay specie.
Jut why is it that the South Carolina
iksareable tomaintain specie payments i
ilst those south of us are not. The only j
son which we can see is that our banks

more than this no reasonable man at
South, or elsewhere, can object. Such
crimination as is here proposeu has been
de by Congress in every act passed for
posing duties from the adoption of the ,
deral Constitution to the present lime,
was made in the compromise act itself,
mo few do contend that, in making
:h discrimination, Congress transcends

laying direct taxes Congress is bound to

i possessions and effects real and pertal,
of every man woman and child in
i country, from the pot hooks andgimto
the wardrobe and cotton plantation.
e power to lay imposts, duties, and
set taxes is given in the same clause,
follows: "Congress shall have power to
and collect taxes, duties, imposts and
uses" &c. The only restriction is that
form'1?not upon all articles but,?

ne of the framers, or early interpreters
the Constitution doubted tiiat Congress
1 power, in assessing duties, to make
in heavier on some articles than on oth,
or to lay them on some and not on
ers. And it has been a common prac* J
3 to admit free of duty, by special acts J

Jase of Ami3Tad Africans.?In
i case the Supreme Court ~of the U.
tes has decreed thai the Africans he j
lased from custody as freemen. The j
ts of the case are as follows.
I'he Laws of Spain prohibit her subjects
m carrying on the African slave trade,
I provido that Africans imported
d her territories shall be free, and that
persons engaged in their importation
II, upon conviction thereof, suffer \

h negroes recently from Africa, in

ina, anu mu im?rou-i were mjiu us i
ires. Of these negroes two Spanish ;
jects purchased more than 50 and I
pped them from Havanna for another i
t of Cuba, knowing their condition.? !
some kind of fraud, they procured a
s, or clearance, signed by the Cover
General of Cuba, representing the no.
les to be "Ladinot" acclimated, or long
idents of Cuba, without which they
m
could not bo slaves, as the slave trade had ti
been abolished ne^Jy 20 years. The e
negroes rose soon after leaving Havanna, s!
and killed the capiain and cook, being all d
the whites on board except Jose Ruiz and
Pedro Montcz, the persons who had bought ^
them and who claimed them as slaves,
These men the Africans required to nav. ^
igatc the ship towards the coast of Africa.
They pretended to obey, but at night ^
they steered for the U. States, and after
some days, reached the coast, where the
vessel was discovered by Lieutenant Ged- (
ney of the U. S. brig Washington, who ^
took possession of it and carried it into a |
port of Connecticut as a piratical vessel. ; ^
The charge of piracy was not sustained, J <
but the negroes were claimed by thsSpart- 1
ish Minister as the property if Ruiz and '
Montcz; and the President was called (
upon to deliver them up under a treaty
wii.i Spain which sripu'ates "that all ships \ 1
and mi.rcbandize of what nature soever, j
shall be restored entire to the proprietor j
as soon as due and sufficient proof shtdl :
be made concerning the property thereof.';k
The negroes, or rather attorneys employ, j ^
ed by benevolent individuals who cspousej
their cause, denied that they were the
property of the claimants, and the Presi. ,
dent very properly refered the question of j ^
property to the proper judicial tribunal.? J
The case was tried in tiic district court of
Connecticut. The decree of the court
. 1
was that the negroes were not slaves, ana
that thev should he delivered to the Pres.
ident to he transported nt the expense of ;

district court an appeal was taken, j 1
through the circuit court, to the Supreme j'
Court, The decision of this tribunal is j
that the Africans be discharged at once, j1
because they are not slaves, but freemen, !'
according to the laws of Spain ; and because
they do not come within the mean-; J
ing of the law for transporting to Liberia, j
captured Africans illegally brought into j 1
