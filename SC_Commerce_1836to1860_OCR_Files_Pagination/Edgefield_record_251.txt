COMMERCIAL CONVENTION.
The Convetion met at 10 o'clock yes
taif- 'The minutes of the last merting
read, the followiig additional Delegates
apeared and registered their names.
ar SOUTH CAROLINA.
Colleton District.-John Boyle.
TLNNESSE.
Memphis.---Theophilus Field.
Mr. Robson, of Georgia, having been
absent at the time of taking the vote on
the Re.oluttion for the establishment of a
Southern Review, desired leave to record
his vote in favor of laying that Resolution
on the table. Leave was granted. The
Georgia Delegation were thus equally di
vitled on this Resolution.
The Report of the Committee of 21
was then taken up and adopted.
On the adolption ofthe first Resolition
accompanying the Report of Mr. King,
some debate arose.
Mr. Preston observcd,that the principles
we maintained and on which onr enter
prize depended, seemed to forbid the par
ticular favoring by State legislation, even
:of Southern commerce. Ifrthe merchants
'were unequally taxel, let it be recommen
ded to the Leegislattires to relieve them
from the unequal bnrden, and he ollered
.an amendment to the Resolution, to that
effect.
Mr. King explaited that it was on the
supposition such inequality did exi4 that
the Report and Resolutious were ounided.
Mr. Felder denied that lands and ne
groes were more highly taxed than com
merce, and called for the proof.
Mr, King defended the principles and
recommendations of the Report, and im
sisted that the taxing of tncrcantile profits
rather thatn stock, while it would favor
trade, would have no tendency to diminish
taxes
Mr. Felder said in reply. that the ca-e
of a cargo of goods remaining unsold fbr
several years subject to yearly taxation,
was an extreme case-there are extreme
cases in agriculture as well as trade.
: Col. Hayne stated that the merchants
of Charleston were taxed 700 per cent
more than those of New York, in propor
tion-it was desired to place theta on an
equality.
Judge Longstreet opposed the Resolu
tion. It was not proper for the Conven
*tion. The grievance complained of af.
fected Charleston, and the Delegates front
Georgia, North Carolina. &c. were called
bpon to request South Carolina to reform
1er policy!
. Mr. McCord could not see the sound
ness of the objections to the Resolutions,
and shewed by facts within his otwn knowl
edge, that the nterebants toere most une
.ually taxed.
Judge -Longstreet pointedly and at
length defended his objection that the suh
ject was improper for the action of the
Convention.
- - Mr. Preston called for the reading of
the Resolution, and said that it was a
.eneral recommendaidon by the Conven
t= a a'body, to all the States concerned
and therefore no interference of citizens
of one State with the legislation of anoth
er. Besides the Resolution as amended,
was no more than the statement and re
commeniation of a principle of Free
Trade.
Judge Longstreet replied, that the re
commendation was supported entirely by
reference to South Carolina legislation,
and ie therefore considered his objection
unanswered. He thought he saw inmmi
nent danger in this loose actionl of the Con
vention.
Gen. Hlayne said, the Convention did
not propose to dictate to or control State
Legislation,~but presented infornmation and
preferred -a petition ror the consideration
of the Legislature, not proposinig'eithter ito
increase taxes on agriculture, or to dim in
ish those on trade, btut submitting to themt
that there wa~s a mode of taxa ition on trade,
injurious to it, and not adviantateotus to
the States.. He pointed out the diterene
between Commercial and Agricultural
capital,-the former must he0 consumed to
produice income, the latter remains and is
permtatnent. HeI said if the construction
of the gentlemnan from Georgia wvere cor
rect, the Convention itself with all its dis
cussions a'ud objects is an impertinance
and an intrusion on State Legislation,
State feeling and sectional induependence.
Mr. Hunntsidl the Convention had been
three. daysi session withou t touching t he
only subject-'bich was the real tand stub
stautial objec of this meeting. That sub
e 5ot was still iu the hands of the Commit.
teesorten. lHe proceeded to show that the
~estoration of Southern Commerce die
eonds upon the possibility of inporting and
selling goods as cheap in Southern pots
as tn Naisthorn.
Mr.Miller of- Augusta, me a variety of
statements~ showing that the taxces Ott

Carolina. -
*- hTe question was then taken on alr.

Mr. Elmore from the Committee of ten,
read their report on thi inquiry referred to
thei Sn Monday. The Report elicited
some dbate, and on the suggestion of the
Chairman of the Committee, it was unan
imously ordered to be printed with the pro

On motion the thanks of the Conven

CONVENTION DINNER.
An elegant and sumptuous lfeast was
given, on Wednesday last, at the New Ho
it-l, to the Delegates of the Commercial
Convention. The entertainment was
served up in the spaeions area of the lo
tel, (yet unfinished, but already risen to its
former proporti-ins, fron the ashes of last
April's conflagration) which was elegantly
arranged for the occasion. The' entire
space was canopied with an awning, and
the interior and sides were decorated with
wreaths, transparencies, and emblemati
cal devices, producing a very fine effect.
Among the decorations was a painting,
executed by a Charleston Artist, represen
ting the harbor of Chtrleston in 18-0,
crowded with the noble steam ships that
are to bring the wealth of the world into
the lap of the fair queen of the South.
The viands were excellent, ftriislied by
Lee; and the wines were exquisite fron
the cellar of Messrs. M'Neill and Blair; and
about 450 persons sat down to etjoy the
good cheer, which was enlivened by the
music of a skilful band. The lion Ienry
L. Pitickney, Mayor of tho City, presided:
assisted by the following gentlemen is
Vice Presidents:
Hon. Robert Y. Hayne, Thomas Ben
nett, Col. A. Blandintg. lion. J. Hatilton
Gen. Edwards, Hon. Alfred Hutger, Rene

Esq'rs.
The utmost conviviality and good feel

merous elogntent and soul stirtitng addres

reason and the flow orsotil."
A fter the repast wvas over, the follow

In compliance wvith the reiterated calls
of the meetitng, the lion. Wmn. C. Preston
rose and pronounced a speech worthy of
is lofty rentown. Commerce wvas his in
spiring theme, and ho brought to its illus
tration andl adornment the force of genius
and the jewelry of eloquence. His senti

7. By C. Edmondston, Esq.-North
Carolina-She was up and doing when
(he battle was fought for independence
from abroal. she is not fbund wanting when
we strive lbr independence at home.
Edward J. Hale, Esq., of Norih Caro
lina, made the response for our uear neigh
bor, and in the course of his renaarks he
alluded to the circuistance that the dis
tingnis.hed Senator present from South
Carolina had spoken of several of the
Southern States, as having been asleep,
until of late, and' had once spoken or N.
Carolina as having been in a protracted
sleep. He was very glad to announce,
that his native State, whatever she may
have been, was no longer asleep, she had
risen like a strong man from her slumber,
and was up and doing in the race ofenter
prize and improvement. She was rapidly
developing all her resources, multiplying
her facilities ofinternal and external inter
course, and was making such progress in
uanuflactures, that ere long she would be
flound importing cotton from her Southern
icighbors, and exporting her fabrics in re
turn. He gave
The City of Charleston.: May she con
tinue to lilit the great battle of-Southern
Cottmmerce, until her sun shall have reach
ed its meridian-and then may it be com
manded to stand still forever.
The reniarks of Mr. Hale brought out
.Mr. Preston, who humorously conceded
that he had on one occasion, at a meeting
of his cnustituents, half in jest and half in
earnest, called North Carolina, "the Rip
Van W inkle of the South," but if he had
imagined it would have been offence.-or
that it would hinve travelled beyond the
walls of the building, where it was spo
ken, he would never have uttered it. He
was free to confess. however, that it may
have done North Carolina some service
and lie has freely mingled since with her
getnertus people, and believed in H:is heart
they had forgiven him for it. He admit.
ted that she was now wide awoake, and a
worthy compeer of her sisters in the race
ofcnterprize and glory.
8. lBv Gen. HIamilton-The City of Au
gusta-She first opened the book, long
sealed to the Southern States, in which
was traced the course that their wealth and
4patriotism required them to pursue.
Mr. A. J. Miller, of Augusta, made a
happy response to this toast, and offered
the tfollowi. :
The lion. Hugh S. Legarc-A worthy
son of South Carolina-We have heard
of hin in Georgia, and desire to remem
ber him.
The loud plaudits, wit h which this toast
was received, and the deafening calls for
Mr. Legare, brought forth from that gen
tIlenan one of those t irilling bursts of un
premeditated eloqence, which alike en
rapture the audience and mark the genius
of the speaker. Few tme possess the
rare gift of speech. instinct with rich and
profound thought, which characterizes the
discouse of this accomplished orator, and
invests him with a spell of wizard poten
cy. His allusion to the Stcami Engine,
rendering commerce no longer the sport of
the witids and waves, and destined- to
equalizo the ports of the earth in the coin
petition for the trade of the world, was
nost striking and felicitous. The effect
of the exclatmation-"The Mierchant is
abroad-a -reatei than the School-master
--civilizing, humanizing and blessing
tiankind"-was electric. We attempt no
sketch, but coutent ourselves with saying
that the effort was as brilliant and inas
terly as the united poiwer of reason and
elhqtience could iuke it. Mr. L. con
cluded with the following beautiful senti
menit.
Commerce--The best hanid-mnaid of
Christianity-Tfhe true foster-mtother of
civili.ation-hter spirit is"good will among
mien,"-her smiile is "peace on earth."
9. By the lHon. Alfred ltiger-The Re
public of Texas-The blood of her pieople
i'. of' the Saxoni die, and liberty is their
instinct. 11er warriors sprang from the
South and the West, atnd their spirits are
invincible. 11cr exhaustless resources, so
recently made manifest by one of our
tmtst distinguished citizens, give new cvi
detuce that her course is onwardl and her
triumph certain.
Gen. Hamilton, who had jnst returned
from a visit to this young and kindred re
piubli'o of the Sotuth, responded for her, in
an eloquent sp)eech, paitiing the beauty
of her natural scenery, atnd de'eribing the
exbatnstless fertility of her soil andI the
chieering abhudance of her resources. He
ended w~ith the following sentment:
The Republic of Teras-Our first child
-a thrifty hantling-having a most extra
ordinary family likeness.
12. By James Robertson, E~q.-Great
Britain-Our fatherland, from which our
principles of liberty mttst receive ntrruute
andl support.
T1his sentimnent was received with lontd
atid long contrinued plaudits. A frer the
noise subsided, 11er IBritannia .Majesty's
Consul to this City, WVm. Ogilby, Esq,
rose atnd made his acknowledgmnents in a
neat and happy address. He. alluded to
the kindness and hospitality biehad often
experiencedl in this city, andu to the exis
ting dilliculty on the Northt-Eastern border,
between his nation atid ours, deprecated a
war between countries, w hose m uttial itn
terests were so closely linked with the
preservation of peace and cordial relations.
lHe made the gratifying declaration, that
recent experience while in his own country,
authorised him to say that the -feelincs of

and-most friendly character towards our
flourishing republic; and he believed the

REPORT
On the Taxation of Couranercial. Capital.
Your Committee are deeply civinced
that much of the Legislation of theSouth,
instead of fostering and encouraging, has
tended to discourage and depress. com
merce. The same principles which -in
England have sustained the corn laws in
that country, have prevailed here. The
Legislative power has been chiefly in the
hands of the agriculturalists. They have
been accustomed to pay a tax on their pro
jerty, according to its estimated value.
'heir capital is fixed and cannot escape
from the impost. They have naturally
enough considered, that capital invested in
trade ought to contribute its fair propor
tion to the revenue of the country, and
without sulliciently considering its floating
character, the facility with which it can be
removed beyord: the reach of their taxa
tion, and its constant tendency to escape
from it, they have generally imposed taxes
on this floating, on the same principles as
on fixed capital. It is believed that much
heavier taxes have generally been imposed
on the former than on the.latter. In one.of
the Southern States, thirty cents ad valo
rem is levied on every hundred dollars, of
the lands granted by the State, and sixty
cents per head on all slaves; and for a
number of years in that very State, a tax
of sixty cents on the hundred dollars of
stock in trade has been levied. This ad
valoron tax on the lands is levied on an
estimate of their value, which in most in
stances is very greatly below their real
value-and slaves may now he stated at
an average value of three hundred dol
lars, so that in fact lands and slaves do
not pay one fourth, certainly not one third
of the tax imposed on stock in trade, and
your committee believe a corresponding
tixation prevails in all the Southern and
South-Western States. Besides no re
gard has been had to the productiveness or
unproductiveness of this stock in trade.
Goods may have come to a falling market,
when it might lie ruinous to sell. If they
are kept for better times-if they are not
forced on the market, and are at the end
of the year found still in the hands of the
merchant, they are again compelled to pay
the tax, while in the mean time interest
and all other iicidental expenses are ac
cumulating on the investment. In pay
ing a tax on land and agricultural capital,
it is paid on what almost without fail yields
an income or profit. In paying it on com
mercial capital. it is paid on what may or
may not, in the fluctuations of trade,make
either a profit or a loss. It is scarce-ly to
be expected that, large stocks of goods in
the face of such a tax, can ever accumu
late in the hands of our merchants. Your
committee know that it has produced this
evil and driven goods from us, whichother
erwise would have remained here to seek
a market. To secure the trade at which
,ve aim and to which tho. Sotth is justly
entitled, large stocks of goods are iudis
pensable. The foreign Merchants and our
brethren at the North, must he encouraged
to bring their goods here to await a sale
with the full assurance that they shall be
subject to no taxation until sales shall
have been effected. Then may we expect
to see our varehbonses filled with all kinds
of comrnmodities-the merchant of Man
chester, or Leeds or Lowell,will not hesi
tate to send his goods to -he stored here.
The importing merchant will not have
his capital diminished without a certainty
of being able to make a profit to replace
it. The tmerchant. who comes from the
interior to lay in his supplies, will have no
need to go to another market to find an
assortment, or to make his purchase here,
burdeaed by a tax from which he derives
no benefit. It is not easy to estimate the
imptulse which such a state of things would
give to our tr-ade-howv much it would
both encourage the itmporting merchant.
to have always on hand a large stock of
goodls, atnd attract the merchan's from our
interior to our Emiporiums. It would en
courage a cotmpetition of both-sellers and
buyers in otnr markets, and which could
scarcely fail to produce the most favora
ble results:
Your Committee believe that by a dif
ferent mode of laying taxes on the com
mercial comtmunity, the Southern and S.
Western States might avoid the evils
whi-:h your Commtttee are persuaded,have
arisen from the mode hitherto pursued
wvithtout any dtminution of revenue. Let
the tax be imposed ott the income of thte
merchtant,on the interest which he derives
from the capital invested, and the clear
profit which heo makes. The States many
wcll depentd on his honor, on his ambition
to hol or raise his standing amnong his
comp~etitnrs, on his desire to maintain his
credit-for faithf'ul returns of his itncome.
The risk may be that he will over esti
mate rather thatn under value it. and a
mtoderate equitable tax otn it-youtr Comn
maittee believe would assuredly make tip
for all that wottld be lost by abandoning
the prevalent mode of taxing his capital
and they submit two Resolutions, which if
carried otut into advised legislation, might,
they ttrust, aid us efficiently in the great
object in which they are now engaged.
Resolved, Thnt this Conventiotn ear
nestly recommend to the respectiye Leg
islatures of the Southern and South West
e~in States, so to frame their legislation, as
to encoutrage the accumulation of Com
mercial Capital in the Southern Atlantic
and South Western Sea Ports- in other
words, to make those ports Emporiums of
Commerce, and so far as may be practi
cable, free ports, where the objects of trade
may be collected and remain exempt from
all State or- Corporation taxation, until
sales of them be collected-and that the
taxes-lten be levied only on the interest of
the capital invested in such sales and on
the nett -profits derived from them.
Resolved, That, in the opinion of this
Convention, the object of the last prece
ding resolution, could be best effected by
exempttng capital employed in commerce
fronm all taxation, except an annual tax on
the interest and profits -derived from the
capital so invested.

EDGEFIELD C. H
- THTURSDAY. MAY 2, 1839.
We have received a note from the author of
"Iconoelast,". who says that we deelined to pub.
lish his article and, assigned as a reason,.that it
is contrary to "the rule of editors to publish
connunications which have not responsible
signatures appended." He denies that this is
a rule. Now we know that it is a rule of many
editors,with whom we exchange. The Mercury,
Courier and Constitutionalist recently declined
publishing articles on miscellaneous subjects,
merely. because they lacked the authority of a
real name. The following is the standing rule
of the Alabama Journal, on this subject:
"All notices of marriages, deaths, &c. and all
communications, intended for the paper must
be accompanied by a responsible name." It will
suffice to say, that the editor of this paper, is an
experienced practical printer, who certainly
knows what are the duties and rights of editors.
To this rule however, there are exceptions,
and we intended to make the article by "*cono.
clast" one, before we received his note. The
subject is ofsuch a nature, that the article merits
publication. We did not positively decline
publishing his communication, as "Iconoclast"
supposes.
Doubtless we now know the author, and we
cheerfully give him a place. We still urge upon
our Correspondents the propriety of giving
their true names to us. Surely they are not
ashamed of their own productions! It is often
absolutely necessary for the editor to know
their names Frequently, commas, words, and
sentences are illegible in a manuscript, which
the author alone can make plain. To whom
will the editor go, ifhe does not know the wri
ter? A writer would be much mortified to
see his communication incorrectly pinted. But
if lie will not give his true name,he cannot blame
tie editor, if he guesses at the meaning of an
obscure manuscript, & should make sonic blun
ders in the publication. The propriety of our
rule is too manifest, to say any thing more.
FLORIDA.-We learn from a letter received
from Florida, by a lady in this place, that Gen.
Macomb was empowered to treat with the In
dinns, allowing them to remain in the Ever
glades. Late accuunts state that preliminaries
of a treaty of peace have already been entered.
into.
The Rutherford (N. C.) Gazette, of the 16th
April says, "we learn from a gentleman from
Haywood County, that there have been three
falls of snow, in that and the adjoining Coun
tics, within the last week or two." -
Edmund Burke, recently elected a member
of Congress, from New Hampshire, is the edi
tor of the Newport Argue & Spectator, a Do
mocratic paper.
Making Doctors by the Wholesale.-At the re
cent commencement of the University of Penn
sylvania, the degree of Doctor of Medicine, was
conferred on onchundred andfifty-siz Students.
The Convcention Dinner -The Charleston pa
pers give an animated description of the Din
ner which was served up to the Delegates in
the New Hotel. The editor of the Mercury
seems to have been somewhat under the in
spiration of the "rosy god," when lie penned his
account of the big dinner. He speaks elo
quently aboutfine wines-rich riands-rare sau
ces-pastries, and all the et ceteras of a feast!
Even the grave editor of the Courier gives
rather a lively account of the dinner. Theoc
seasion was evidently one of great "jollification"
to use the word of a Paddy. Oh ! that wecould
hnave "been there to see," yea, and to taste too!
But alas ! fate compelled us to stay at home and
eat our plain dinner, and quaff our cup of tea in
solitude ! We have been asked, what the Con
yention did. Read our paper, friends, and you
will see that a great dealJ of importance was
done, and much that was highly interesting
particularly on the day of the grand dinner at
the New Hotel. We make sonic extracts fromi
the report of the Magn4icent Feast by the
C ourier..
Those ofour readers who are fond of hunt
ing, will relish the sketch of our friend "Vena
tor." We ourselves have hunted with the
company of'which lie gives an account, though
it was never our fortune while with them, to be
present at "the deatih" of the "antlered stag," or

British outrage upon American Property-Too
little attention has, been paid to the outrage
which wvas perpetrated upon the property of
9American citizens, by a British Governor. It
seems to us,~that our Government has manifes
ted a cold indifference in thtis matter, to the
rights of the:South. The right to compensa
tion for property seized by a foreign power. has
not been suflicienty urged. Our Senator, Mr.:
Calhoun, and our i ^ ' te Representative,:
Mr. PickRens; have. ca~ public attention to
this -suibject, and have spoken about it in thatk
bold and manly tone, which becomes the Re
presentatives of ahigh-~minded and injured pee.

than indignant, when he reads that comipensa

the wanton seizure of their property by Offi.

THE BRITISH OUTRAGE.

justly be deprived of his property under
the operation of a municipal'law to which
he had not subjected himself.' -The con
troversy turns then, as Mr. Stevenson says
on the principle asserted by the British
Government, that persons are notproperty.
If this were true, there would have been
no more ri ht to redress in thcases'of the
Comet an Emporium than in the case of
the Enterprize, for the passage of Great
Britain's emancipating amicipal law in
the interval, could nut affect American
property; and if slaves cannot now be pro
perty in the possession of Atnericans, neith
er could they have been previous to the
Emancipation Bill. Butthat Ihey are as

and that they always were. oigbfpJly the
subject of proerty-we will show byg

dicial decisions, which we gave more full
in this paper in 1835-as these authorities,
though alluded to in a general manner, are
not specially referred to by Mr. Steven,
son: and as they are deciuive on the point
against Great Britain.
Sir Win. Grant, in d tiveringjudgment
In 18iO, in a case where the questions
raised were-first, wheth er slaery we e

if so, whether the Slave Trade were not
also against them-said
"We cannot legislate for other countries,"
-" We cannot compel the sub.ects:of other
Nations to observe any other tn e"it,
and generally received principles-o funi

Here we have the decisiOn turning, on
the municipal regulations of the British
Empire, that the Sleve Trade, ii 6f

Subsequently, the Disna, a.Swedish,
vessel was condemned ai Sierra Leone;
upon appeal the sentence- was reversed.
Sir William Scott, in reversing it, said,
that the Court was willing t6 go ag.inst
the Slave Trade, as far as the law of Na

English tribunals would warrant, 'but be

now slavery) as far as-British isject are
concerned; but it claims no right oenfor

Afterwards, in 1817, in the case of i-Le
Louis, Sir William Scott said
