LI VEtirUOL, June at.? Since our,
circular of the I5th inst. we have had a !
good demand for Cotton, both from the
trade and speculators, and prices have i
advanced 1-8 a 1-4 per lb. In the. early
part of the week the quantity offering
was moderate, hut a good portion of the
recent arrivals having since been placed
on the market, there has been more
choice, and holders appear disposed to
meet the demand at the above improvement.
The sales for the week ended last
evening amount to 30,410 hales, of which
7750 were uplands, at 4 1-2 a 8; ll,f>80
Orleans at 4 1-2 a 7 3-4, with 20 at 8 1-4;
81(50 Mobile and Alabama at 4 1-8 a 7 1-2,

Melancholy Occurrence.?YVe are called on
to record another melancholy and distressing in
stance of sudden death, which occurred on Saturday
last, the 2Dth ult. in Middle Salein, Sumter
dist. Miss Adeline Anderson, a young lady of 16
or 17 years of age, daughter of Edward Anderson
Esq., ol Middle Salein, with a number of other
young persons of both sexes, were on that dnv making
a short pleasure excursion, on horseback,
when Miss A. apparently fainted, and fell from her
liorse. qIip was instantly taken up, but ihe vital
spark had flown. On further examination it was
iound, that in the fall her neck had been diHocated.
Thus, in an unexprctcd moment, have the
affectionate and afflicted parents been called on to
snourn the sudden and violent death of the first
child it lias been their misfortune to lose.
It is astonishing, at least to us, what ridiculous
words and phrases have gradually crept into our
Aemrican vocabulary, it would be foul slander to
say English. From Joe Strickland, down to the
present time, Jack Downing of course included,
there has been a great rage for the absurd and
ridiculous. The dialect of a few ignorant bumpkins,
has been imitated, not in the spelling and
pronunciatiou of some common-place expiessions,
but throughout our language there is scarcely a
phrase, or a sentiment 60 refined as to have escaped
an introduction into the barbarous dialect now so
fashionable. Low Yankee slang, newly invented
Western coinage, Indian blunders, Negro grammar,
and African gibberish, having taken the place
of Purity, Propriety and Precision of language;
and if there is not some measure taken to arrest
these inroads upon the English tongue, we may
lay aside our dictionaries in despair.
We fear thai this encroachment upon our mother
tongue has been too much encouraged by our
brethren of the Press, at all events we wish for the
honor of our country abroad that such stufT should
find its way oni.v into the columns of such newspapers
as do not aspire to the honor of crossing
the Atlantic. Here such ridiculous perversion of
language is calculated to excite a smile, but when
extracted from the columns of one to another, an J
lauded and admired as witty in the extreme, they
become important in the eyes of others, and
when they reach another country are looked upon
as specimens of native taste, and native Jonatiiamsm.
A writer in the Charleston Patriot over the signature
of " RIO," states, that a society is formed
in Columbia, under the auspices of the 14 Telescope,"
with the name of the Native Soutti Carolina
Society, the object of which is to obtain
such an alteration in the naturalization laws, as to
require of aliens a residence of twenty-one years
in this country, before they nre entitled to citizen^
ship. This is the first we have heard of the mattL
ter, and from its absurdity are inclined to doubt,
i** Will our neighbor inform us, w hether'* RIO" is
* right or not?

Communications.
For the Courier.
Mr. Editor ;?** Every man to his
trade," is a motto which has guided mahy
a man to the highest attainments of success
in his profession. And I do most
sincerely' believe, that if an individual
would excel, he must be a man of one business.
This we know nnnliec vorv
.. ?rl . .w.~.
hly In religious rtiatters : not that a religious
man is to lay aside all terrestial
things, but he must be decidedly and universe
lly a christian, if he would run the
race 10 as to win. Now, Sir, as I am not
a student on all subjects, when in need of
some little knowledge for pratical uses I
would apply to those who profess to know
such matters. The object of this communication
is respectfully to ask some of the
sons of Esculapius belonging to our town
to inform your readers, under what circumstances
the rays of the sun are injurious
to the human system ? or, in. other
words, what effects the rays of the sun
have on the body under various circuit!I
stances. It must be generally believed
| that there are limes when the direct rays
of the sun will injure the most healthy
j But sir, I have observed that the most o.'
, physicians never protect themselves from
'exposure of this kind.* And, we all know
that those who labor in the sun are the
most healthy class of persons in the country.
As it is not a busy time, 1 hope some
one will gratify your readers, and among
the rest,
Yours very respectfully,
PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE.
Removal of the Chickasaws.?The
Memphis Gazette of the llthull. says: "A
party of 51)0 Chickasaw Indians, under
the direction of the supei inteudeiit, Col. A
M. It pshaw, passed through this place on
the 4tn ult.
"They presented a handsome appearance
being nearly all mounted, and, with few
exceptions, well dressed in their naiional
costume. It has been remarked by many
of our citizens, who have witnessed the passage
of emigiating Indians, that on no
! previous occasion wn? there as good order
or iiiore drsnateh iMni n <ln.?iL-^n 1.
we believe, was seen hi the company; ami
the whole, alter travelling eighteen miles,
crossed the Mississippi on the same day.
"We are informed that there are bu!
two or three on the sick list; and they are
recovering. The Indians seem to be much
pleased with the officers, and the greatest
cheerfulness prevails amongst them."
The same paper a ds, that the officers
engaged in conducting the Indians had
much difficulty in collecting them, owing to
the interlerence of designing persons. Emubby,
chief counsellor to the Chickasaw
King, was murdered by a white man na!
med Jones, shortly previous to the removal
' of the Indians, and much delay was apprehended
in consequetrce of his d< atli.?
No serious dit' cully, however, occurred.
F.muhby is spoken of as a brave and generous
warrior, who touglit under Gen. Jackson
in most of his wars.
"The following is a list of the officers,
all of whom enjoy good health:
''Col. A. M. Unshaw. SuDerintondent!
' I 1
Capt. J. A. Phillips, II. 8. A. Disbursing
officer; D. Vanderslice, Essistant Superintendent;
J. M. Milland, Conductor; Wm,
H. Guy, Com nissary and Assistant Conductor;
F. G. Roche, Enrolling Agent; Dr.
C. G. Keenan, Medical Director."
Extraordinary Surgical Operation.
In passing along South Bridge yesterday
forenoon, our attention was arrested by a
great crowd of gentlemen, at the gate ol
tl.c Royal Infirmary, Pressing inward
Joining the crowd, we were carried along
with it to the Surgical Hospital, where wc
found the operating theatre crammed tr
i excess, chiefly by medical gentlemen am
students; among these were recognizee
Sir George Ballingal, Dr. Maclagan, Mr
Newbigging, Dr. Campbell, the surgeons
*6f the 14th light dragoons and the 42d 1
regiment, besides many country surgeons. ,
The excitement we have described was j
occasioned by the knowledge that an
operation. never performed in Great Bri- '
tain was to be done upon a young man '
by Professor Lizars. The case was what ,
was technically called aneurism or the t
ubclavian artery, so near the heart that
the iirst large trunk required to be tied, |
namely, the arterie imiomiaata. The |
young man, a carter, from Dalkeith, was
placed upon the table, and the professor (
commenced by making an incision in the |
neck, and progressively cut down to the ,
artery, when the ligature was applied. .
The operation was completely successful.
The patient, who bore it with uncommon
fortitude, was only on the table for fifteen (
minutes altogether. This, as we have, J
already said, is the first operation of the 1
kind which has been attempted in Great
Britain. We understand that it was once
successfully performed in Berlin, by Dr. (J
i liraepc, and once in lYew-York, by Dr. '
Mutt.?Caledonian Mercury. J
An Anecdote.?A young preacher in i
the State of Ohio, made a covenant with j
a small congregation to preach to them 1
for one hundred dollars a year. When j
the clerical council were convened for his
ordination, upon hearing the amount of .
his salary they remonstrated with the
trustees, and endeavored to obtain six hun- 1
dred for their young friend. Failing in '
that, they lessened their demand to four !
hundred, and then to three. The young ,
preacher bore no share in this bargain- I
making, the trustees would not increase
the salary, and the ministers went away
refusing to ordain the new incumbent.
He continued to preach without ordina
tion, and in a little time it was noted that 1
the daughter of a wealthy member of ano- j
ther sect who had been in the habit of
occasionally attending the young man's i
I preaching, became a regular and a constanthearer.
Mother soon followed?then
father. The young man won the whole
family over to his faith and mode of worship?married
the daughter and thirty
thousand dollars, and generously continued
preaching for his society for many
years upon their own terms. It is related
of him that when one of the elder brethren
in the ministry made an application
?> ? ???i |'ci.iuiiuiy ussniiini'u ill some |
church enterprize, the young husband answered
that he would cheerfully contribute
to it the expenses which had been incurred
on the occasion of his ordination.?iV. Y.
Sun,
i
Who are the friends of the poor? The I
Cinrinatti Whig says, ''There are now at 1
least 200 pilots and es many engineers,
thiown out of employ l?y the falling oft*
of business upon the western waters, and
twelve ir fifteen hundred hands. These
are the times in which Benton was to have
"Gold running up the Mississippi, so fast;
and with this empty sound he still attempts
to cheat the people out of their common
sense, and their bread. The gold has all
Iron into the pocket of Benton and Company,
while the common people are left
without employment or means of living."
A Problem for Politicians.?If Gen.
Jackson by his endeavors to restore a
hard money currency, in eight years increased
the number of banks from 329 to
823, how long will it take Mr. Van Buren,
by "following in the footsteps" and
"carrying out the policy" of Gen. Jackson,
to abolish the Banks altogether?? An
answer is requested.?Illinois Patriot.

for present demands, the maiutninance of manufactures,
and the regulation of commerce. Every
thing of pecuniary interest to the Government
and the nation will be involved i . the discussions
of the next Congress; ami it was because the President
would not have those ail important subjects
left to Executive discretion a moment beyond the
time when a full Congress could be summoned,
that the September session was convoked The
machinery of government, even when thrown out
of geer, must continue to work hut when so disordered,
its movement may he driven in a wrong
direction. The Representatives of the people are
alone competent to set all to rights. No Democratic
Chief Magistrate would continue, in the
condition of tilings at present existing, to substitute
Executive expedients for clearly defined law
springing from the public will.
