tion. Successive layers of an argillaceous scMetue,
alternated with occasional veins of coarse quart*,
from a few inches to a foot or more in width, in dis
jointed fragments, but all in junta-position, almost
entirely compose, and beautifully diversify its slop
• tog sides. Slate, however, generally changes its
character and aspects in receding from primitive to
transition regions. The southern entrance of the
cut, therefore, is composed of talcous slate, well
characterised by its shining lustre, slightly green
ish tint, lamellated structure, and saponaceous feel:
but as we go on, it is soon found to run into mica
•late_bent and contorted in various directions, and
Ultimately degenerating iftto a more earthy tex
ture, as it approaches the transition rocks. Instead
of the silvery white, bluish grey or light green,
colors so common to this description of mineral,
large deposits were found wearing-the dark purple
hue of the Amethyst j a tint, so far as I know, only
found in American specimens.
• A few miles beyond this point, the geological as
pect of the country rapidly changes, and the transi
tion region begins. Iron-stone abounds, under the
form of the black oxide, which frequently encum
bers the road in globular or amorphous masses,
often covered with an ochrey incrustation, the re
sult of increased oxidation from exposure to air and
moisture. Farther on toward the secondary forma
tion, (whose undefined boundary must run in the
vicinity of Cassville,) and at a distance probably not
exceeding fifteen or twenty miles from the “ deep
cut” described, there are said to be exhaustless
supplies of the per-oxide of Iron, (Red Hematite,)
yielding seventy-five per cent of the pure metal.
I had not time to visit this interesting deposit, but
have no doubt from the mineral developements of
the adjacent region, and the intelligent source from
which my information was derived, that as soon as
a sufficient outlet is afforded by the completion of
the great works of internal improvement, now in
progress, and widely traversing this interesting
portion of the South, the disembowelled contents of
our native mountains, submitted to the transforming
agencies of the forge and hammer, may be traced in
their rapid distribution, for hundreds of miles to the
eastward and westward, furnishing a vast tract of
country for ages to come, with any desired quantity
of the most valuable of metals.
And here permit me to remark, en passant, apart
from every political aspect of the question, that
whatever errors may be chargeable upon former le
gislation, whether from premature action or improvi
dent expenditure, the generous pride and public
spirit of Georgians will find much in the history of
the times to extenuate both. It was at a period
when the plethoric state of the public treasury
seemed to authorize depletion,—when prosperity
smiled upon our agriculture and our commerce,
and bade fair to compensate sufficiently the drain
effected by the requisite appropriation; and when
too the South had just aroused from the Rip-Van
Winkle slumber of half a score years to behold a
new era in the history of civilization, developing the
wonders of locomotive power and speed—unlocking
countless resources of national prosperity to the
North and East, and bringing the distant thou
sands who thronged the thoroughfares of Jheir
large and flourishing cities, into the desirable con
tiguity of next door neighbors. Surrounded by
these inspiring circumstances, and sprung by a lau
dable zeal to make atonement for past remissness,
as well as desirous to sustain the jeoparded honors
of the South against the charge of supineness and
inaction amid the unparalleled improvements of the
age, the Legislature of the state projected the mag
nificent scheme of opening up a direct and rapid
communication with the great allevial region of the
West, and inviting the influx of its ample products
to the interior and seaboard of our own state. It is
true that this being the first great movement of our
people in a work of the sort, their inexperience ne
cessarily subjected them to much embarrassment
and perhaps to some heavy expenditures of the
public funds, which a stricter economy and riper
■kill would have' avoided. But the work was
promptly commenced and has been vigorously pros
ecuted, until the most formidable barriers have
bowed before the reiterated blows of state enter
prize, and the long line of cleft hills and raised
valleys in our far North West stand in submissive
readiness to tiansmit through their once desert
haunts, the thundering locomotive with its flying
train of mineral and agricultural wealth. Fifty ]
four miles of the road are now under cars, and with
very little further expense the whole might be
speedily completed to its junction with the Mem
phis branch, five miles beyond Cassville, forming,
thus, an outlet to the valley of the Mississippi,
through the waters of the Coosa and the Tennessee
rivers, (with an intervening rail-road,) regarded by
some of the moBt sagacious calculators, as likely to
be far more valuable in its contributions, than the
main trunk itself, westward of that point. The two
grand tracks through the interior, and opening up
a communication with the Atlantic, the one through
Macon to Savannah ; and the other through Augus
ta to Charleston, are rapidly approaching the ter
minus of the main trunk, and will certainly reach it
at an early day.
Ill VltJW, lllttUt UI all Uiak i/cc/t
and of all that may be reasonably expected from the
completion of this great work, would it be sound
policy or wise legislation to abandon the whole 1 j
True, thousands have been expended, and no lucra
tive results have yet followed, but the most stu
pendous works of art are often worthless, as
well as profitless, until the last crowning appendage
gives entireness to the machinery, and efficiency to
all its parts. Great enterprizes, indeed, almost ne
cessarily involve either great, investments, great
hazards or great efforts, physical, intellectual, or
moral, and in some instances, a combination of the
whole. But while unbending purpose, steady pur
suit and vigorous action will generally secure a
fortunate issue, and compensate for all, inconstan
cy, timidity, and apathy, either jointly or severally,
are usually fatal to the success of the noblest
schemes.
It was a timid and craven spirit in his mutinous
crew, which tried the firmness and endangered the
life of the great Genoese navigator, when after
eight years of thankless foil in procuring his outfit,
and twenty days and nights of perilous suspense
upon unknown seas, he was assailed by the clamor
ous cry of—“ turn back, turn back, abandon the
chimerical adventure.” Scarcely, however, had
the croakings of the noisy discontents, been silenc
ed by his ingenuity, when lo ! the wealth and gran
deur of a new world were seen streaking the hori
zon before him, and offering through their immortal
discoverer, their exhaustless resources to unborn
millions ! But enough of this disgression.—My
journey must be pursued. A. Means.

HAYNEVILLE CIRCUIT, ALABAMA CON
- FERENCE.
Dear Brother,—We are glad to inform the friends
of Zion that God has recently visited HayneviBe
Circuit, with a graciousrevival of religion. Our third
quarterly meeting was held at Hayneville, and
commenced on the 10th August, the meeting lasted
ten days; brother John W. Starr our Presiding El
der, and brother W. B. Neal of Montgomery, were
with us four days and laboured faithfully and not
without effect .The Lord was present in the gra
cious influences of his spirit; many were converted
and seventeen whites and six blacks were added to
the Methodist Episcopal Church, while the mem"'
berahipof the church was greatly revived. In their
anxiety for the salvation of precious souls, the
brethren were induced to make efforts to have a
camp meeting, in which they succeeded. A meet
ing was appointed at an entirely new place, on the
Lowndboro Ridge, four miles from Hayneville ; and
not willing to wait to build tents on the usual plan,
they determined to adopt the old fashioned style of
cloth tents. The appointment was published and
a fast day appointed, and three weeks from the time
the meeting was appointed, divine service com
menced on the ground.
The result of the faithful preaching Cf God’s
word, and the energetic and persevering prayers
that went up to the throne, of the heavenly grace,
and the various and affectionate efforts made for
the conversion of souls, was, under the blessing of
God, truly encouraging. Many were brought from
darkness to light, and made to rejoice in the wit
ness of sins forgiven, through faith in the Saviour’s
blood. Forty-five whites were added to the Meth
odist Episcopal Church. After the close of the
meeting on Wednesday, we had preaching in
Lowndsboro at night, where we received two more
members. As usual the Methodist Episcopal
Church was not the only church benefited by these
revivals. Since the close of our camp meeting the
Protestant Methodists have received eight or ten
members, most of whom were converted at our
meeting; and we suppose that some other denomi
nations will share its benefits. The whole number
of whites admitted on trial in the Methodist Episco
pal Church on this Circuit the present year is,
eighty-four whites; and sixty-five blacks; in all
one hundred and forty nine. Our prospects are
still encouraging. To God be all the glory.
Your’s in Christ, P. R- M’Crary,

BLACK-SWAMP CIRCUIT.
Dear Brother Wightman.—Though we have had
no general revival on the Black Swamp Circuit
the present year, yet, we have been moving along
very pleasantly; and have enjoyed peace in our
borders generally. Occasionally there have been
accessions to the Church, and several have been
admitted, who, I doubt not, will make substantial
and useful members.
Recently we have been favoured with a most
gracious out-pouring of the Holy Spirit at one our
appointments. A nine days meeting was held at
Lebanon Church, commencing on the 23 of Septem
ber, at which, God was present in great power.
The Church is small, and our congregations were
not large, so that in reference to numbers the slain
of the Lord was not as great in some other instan
ces, and yet, l have seldom on any occasion, wit
nessed so striking manifestations of the divine
presence and power as at this meeting. It was a
time of special grace and mercy to the people of
God who attended. 17 souls, professed (o obtain
the pardoning mercy of Alraghty God; and 26 (14
whites and 10 coloured) were admitted on trial.
Our Camp Meeting which closed on monday last,
was not marked by any peculiar display of the
awakening and converting grace of God, and yet
we had a very pleasant meeting:—a gracious influ
ence seemed to rest upon the congregation.—The
preachers were assisted from on high; and I trust
the seed sown will be as “bread cast upon the wa
ters, which will be seen after many days.” Three
whites and twenty coloured presented themselves
for admission on trial in the Church. “^To God only
wise, be glory, through Jesus Christ forever.—
Amen.” J. H. Wheeler.

“NORTHERN LIBERALITY.”
Mr. Editor.—Dr. Bond has replied in the Christ
ian Advocate and Journal of October 4, to your edi
torial note on northern liberality. With the “ straws”
and “ the signs of the limes," &c., I have nothing to
do; nor with the “esteem in which the Editor of
the Southern Christian Advocate is held by many
of his brethern in the North.” You can just ar
range all that sort of thing as you please.
But I must request my good brother Dr. Bond, to
do me one simple act of justice. After stating that
the Churches in New-York are much in debt, and
that the calls upon them are frequent; he acknowl
edges that they are closed against public applica
tions for charity; but adds “our people are accessi
ble to you at their places of abode or business." To
this mode he says truly I “did not resort." But he
attributes ray not resorting to this mode to the fact
of my time being limited to bo short a space.
This is the error, (unintentional I have no doubt
on Dr. Bond’s part,) which I wish to Correct, and
which I beg he will do me the justice to correct The
impracticability of presenting a cause of Christian
charity to the Methodist people of N. York individ
ually, might be a sufficient reason for not attempting
it even to those who had no objection to the "mode.”
But my own refusal to “ resort to the mode” pre
scribed, was found in a sense of personal delicacy,
which Carolinians at least, know how to appreciate.
I might resort to such means among old and well
tried friends, but among strangers, never.
And was this the position in which an accredited
minister of the gospel in the Methodist Church was
to be placed 1 To go around as by stealth, and beg
from house to house for a little here and a little
there, as if the cause he represented might not
stand the scrutiny of a public assembly? I scorn
the mode; and never I trust shall the Church I may
represent find me placing her in such an attitude.
I went, the representative of a poor and an unfor
tunate church, but her poverty was no crime, and
her misfortune was from the providence of God.
My desire was publicly to strike the chord of Chris
tian sympathy, and appeal to the liberality of a
Christian people. This, I repeat it, was refused.
It is said, I could not stay long enough. How long
should I have staid ? I learned immediately of the
hostility of the officers of the church; and was I
to lounge away an idle month waiting for nothing ?
I left the city after directing letters to three
churches, and made an excursion to Albany, and
thence to Boston, and returned within a week to
know their decision. And when that was known
why should,1 wait longer, when my people were not
only without a church, but also without a pastor,
and the sickly season was at hand ?
But it might be well to look at the effects which
such a contracted and selfish spirit is produciug, on
th* best Interests of ths church. The Rev. G.
Lane, Treasurer of the Missionary Society of ou*
Church, has just published a comparative table of
the Society’s funds, for the last two years. Accord
ing to this table, the New-York Conference in 1841
-2. contributed an average of 28 cents per member,
being more than 911,000 for more than 30,000 mem
bers, of whom about 400 are coloured. In 1842-3, the
same conference with its membership increased to
over 50,000 members contributed a little over
$7,000, being an average of 14 cents per member,
or 50 per cent discount, on its average contributions
per member of the preceding year. This may be
accounted for as brethren please. I account for it
upon the plain principle that the people are encour
aged in their penuriousness, and that the high and
ennobling spirit of Christian benevolence is giving
way to a spirit of sordid selfishness. They close
their doors against the calls of charity, and shut out
the men who would preach to them the divine and
godlike doctrine of universal benevolence.
But it is said, that the calls are so frequent and
numerous that if they were all responded to, the
Trustees would never find an opportunity of pre
senting the pressing claims upon them for money;
and when they did, they would find the resources
on which they depend utterly exhausted. With
out pretending to prescribe to others how they
should act, it has struck my mind that a very sim
ple way might be found to obviate this difficulty.
There are many Methodist Churches in New York,
and no one who goes on any agency of charity,
expects to have access to all. Why could not a
list of the churches be made, and whenever an
agent came he could be referred to the church
whose turn it was to contribute I And thus each
one would bear its fair proportion, and no one could
complain, But the truth has leaked out in the
apology. It seems to be feared if agents are allow
ed to take collections in the congregations for char
itable purposes to be used abroad, there will be
nothing left for home use. Well, I have heard
this excuse urged for not giving, but never before
I confess in that quarter. I never knew before that
there was danger of a people being too liberal, and
a board of Trustees being put over them to prevent
their giving too much. And this too in a paper
which is always urging that the liberal soul shall
be made fat; that there is that giveth and yet in
creaseth, and there is that withholdeth more than
is meet, and it tendeth to poverty. But the absurd
contradiction of the thing itself remains to be no
ticed. I am told, you cannot take up a collection
in this church,—we are in debt,—and our church
has to be supported, &c., but you may go around
among our member, and solicit privately as much
as you please. And it is softly whispered to me,
you will get more (his way. Now is there any
greater danger of draining the resources of a
church by a public collection, where a man may
nut in just what he pleaseB, than bv personal Bolici
tation, where shame, or pride or something else
may make him give four times, perhaps ten times
as much 1 It appears to me, either that the refusal
to give a collection is intended to thwart the appli
cant, or else it is the most perfect folly. It is true
it subjects him to insult, and degrades him in the
eyes of those to whom he addresses his personal
solicitation, but if he is content to lower himself to
this, the money may still be had.
In the letters I addressed to the pastors of the
churches, setting forth the object of my mission, I
took especial occasion to say concerning this
| “ mode" of application, that I would not resort to it.
The refusal therefore was made with a distinct
| knowledge that it was the end of the matter. I am
perfectly content to leave those' who pursue this
i course, and those who justify it, to settle the mat
j ter in foro conscientioc.
In conclusion, permit me to say, that I have no
personal feelings involved in this matter. I con
ceive neither my reputation nor my happiness at all
f concerned in it. I went in accordance with the
wishes of my church, and not of my own motion.
I performed my duty to the satisfaction of my own
conscience, and of the brethren who sent me.
The amount I might have received, would perhaps
have been no great object any way. But the princi
ple involved I regard as one of no small importance,
one, which if adopted and sustained as the princi
ple of the church on this subject, must inevitably
bring upon her the disapprobation and the curse of
God. I am very respectfully your’s,
Whitefookd Smith.

GENERAL INTELLIGENCE
FOREIGN.
i France.—The Gazette des Tribunaux gives the
following account of another detected conspiracy in
Paris. Most of the other papers, however, make
light of it:—
“ Numerous political arrests were made on Fri
day and Saturday. For some time back, the police
had received intelligence that an association had
been organized with a view to disorder, and that it
was to meet in a short time to discuss the realiza
tion of the undertaking, as wild as culpable, which
it had conceived. Late in the night, the principal
members of this confederacy were arrested on the
premises of a wine merchant in the rue Pastour.
elle, and in several other quarters of Paris. They
are, it is said, about twenty in number. The search
es made at their residences have brought to light a
quantity of seditious writings, arms, cartridges,
and powder. All these individuals belong to the
working classes. The greater portion of them are
without any ostensible means of living, and have
for a long time refused to work. Notwithstanding
the secrecy with which they have carried on their
proceedings, the authorities were on their traces,
and have been able to seize at a single blow aL the
persons engaged in these wretched attempts.”
From China.—A letter published in the Boston
Advertiser, dated United States ship Constellation,
Manilla Bay, May 6th, says they loft Macao Roads
on the morning of the 23d ult., and anchored in that
port about midnight of the 30th, bound homeward.
Just before leaving China, the commander addressed
a somewhat long communication to the Viceroy of
Canton, relative to the American affairs and inter
ests. The Viceroy is said to appear to be of opinion
that Americans will enjoy the same privileges as
other foreigners, without the necessity of treaty
stipulations, and reiterates the assurance that the
claims of our citizens for damages sustained in the
December riot at Canton, shall be promptly paid at
the stipulated time. The same privileges would be
granted to the Spanish nation as to Great Britain,
with the exception of an island; this arrangement
includes specifically privileges of commerce, and the
right of residence at those ports to which foreigners
are admitted. The French have also been engaged
in some negotiations, and have been partially suc
cessful.
Greece.—A letter from Athens states that a
gang of 26 coiners, Greeks, Turks, Italians, and
French had been discovered and arrested in that
city, and handed over to justice.—They had been
occupied in the fabrication of Greek crowns, and
French two franc pieces. Other parties connected
with this gang, to the number of upwards of 200,
have been arrested, many of whom by birth and
fortune, belong to the higher ranks of society.
Porugal.—Don Miguel whose contest for the
throne of Portugal a tew years back will be in the
recollection of many of our readers, appears not to
liave relinquished the prize for which be so long
contended. Almost forgotten in his retirement,
ho has issued a proclamation, which allows that the
abject which eluded his grasp through the deter
mined opposition of his brother, Don Pedro, is still
near his heart.

its Debats states that the Transatlantic steamers
will begin to ply in a few months. There are to be

State of the Charleston Cotton Market.
October 17.1848.
The decline of the New-York Cotton market,
which has taken place since the arrival of the Great
Western, has produced a corresponding decline in
3ur market. Speculators were the chief operators
Lhere, and they having withdrawn, from inability to
meet any further decline, the article has become
exceedingly heavy and dull of sale, even at reduced
priceB.
We learn of no buyers in our market for Euro
pean account, with the exception of one French
House. We quote prices to-day at from 6 1-4 to
3 1-4 A very fair article can be bought at 7 1-2 to
7 3-4.
Indian Affairs.—The Sl Louis Republican
:ontains some further intelligence from the border
tribes of Indians, especially from the Ottoes, who
have recently committed several outrages. They
lelivered to the United States Superintendent two
af the most guilty persons who were sent to Fort
Leveiiworth for confinement About the third day
after their imprisonment they made a rush on the
sentinels. One of them was shot down and died
immediately; the other seized a musket, bounded
aver the hills, and was heard of no more. He pro
bably reached his village in safety, where he will
most likely tell such a horrible tale about the mur
der of his comrade as will not fail to stir up the hot
blood of his excitable tribe, and drive them on to
the commission of further and greater outrages.
The tribe are said to be generally quiet, and much
pleased with the early payment of their annuities,
which enable them to commence their fall hunts
without the usual delay. The Mormons, it ap
pears, have been sending missionaries among seve
ral of the tribes, but for what purpose is not clear
ly ascertained, though measures have been taken to
have them closely watched, and promptly apprehend
ed, if necessary.
Walking through a Window.—Asingularac
cident occurred at the dry goods establishment of
Messrs. G. Al J. W. Bell, in Albany last Saturday
evening. The store, says the Albany Evening Jour
nal, is fitted up with a door and windows of large
plate glass. A stranger from Canada, attracted by
the rich display within the store, and not noticing
the door-way, walked directly up to and through
the plate glass window, shivering the glass into a
thousand fragments, but escaping himself without
injury. On learning the amount of damage was
fifty dollars, the stranger representing himself as a
poor man, and quite unable to make good the amount,
but offered the Messrs. Bell five dollars and his
over-coat, as part compensation for the loss. The
over-coat was declined, but the money accepted, and
added to seventeen dollars, collected among the
Messrs. Bell’s neighbours, in some measure repaid
the loss which the countryman’s carelessness had
occasioned.
Relic.—The Albany Citizen mentions that a
piece of chain armour, beautifully put together,
and evidently fitting the arm, was found not long
since on the line of the New York and Erie Rail
road, in a grave accidentally broken open by the
workmen. Something like a casque was found
with it, and some human bones. The pieces found
were sold to a buyer of scrap iron, and broken up,
except the part we have mentioned.
Early Frost—There have been several frosts
in New York and Connecticut. A gentleman from
Windham, in the latter State, says that the frost on
Thursday night, September 14th was severe, and
apparently killed pumpkin vines, beans, and all the
smaller vegetables.
Embarkation of the Pilgrims.—The picture
representing the “Embarkation of the pilgrims at
Delft Haven,” painted by Weir, for the Rotunda
of the Capitol at Washington, is now exhibiting at
Faneuil Hall, Boston.
Great Speed.—The U. S. Mail Steamer Augus
ta, Capt Rogers, made the trip from Washington,
D. C. to the wharf at Aquia creek, a distance of fifty
six mileB, in two hours and forty four minutes on
Saturday last, the 16th inst.
A Costly Organ.—The New York Couriei
states that Mr. Erben, of that city has contracted
with the Vestry of Trinity Chuch to construct an
organ for their new edifice. The cost of it will be
$10,000.
A Large Population.—It is estimated, says the
New York Aurora, that there are now between
sixty and seventy thousand strangers in the city ol
New York, thus swelling the population of oui
Commercial Emporium to nearly half a million.
