A NATIONAL BANK.
Judging the tone of a portion of the
newspapers at the;South and South West,
there are still, in those sections, many
warm advocates of a National Bank ; and
the favor with which they regard such an
Institution, appears to rest chiefly on its
supposed usefuiness in regulating the ex
changes. There is no need of discussing
the subject at this late day, with a.view to
any practical result,-for there is not the
least probability that a National Bank
will ever again he established in this
country. But possibly it may console
some of the advocates of the measure, to
discover that the exchanges are in a
much better condition without such an
Institution, than they ever were with one.
In fact, a !,great regulator," designed to
counteract the immutable laws of trade,
wichcawne'ver be related with impunity,
is in the end the greatest disturber of the
exchanges as we have too fataily seen.
rMr. Pickens of Carolina, in an able
speech delivered on the floor of Congress,
Aug. 9th 1841. (the whole of which
would richly reward a perusal.) presents
some sound views on the subject, adapted
to the latitudes and longitudes above
mentioned; and also some facts, showing
the state of exchanges between different
parts of the country at various periods du
ring the existence of the U. S. Bank.
The views-of Mr. P. have received am
ple confirmation, since they were presen
ted to Congress, in the admirable working
of the charges under the free system.
No pond 'ous machinery of man's devi
sing has been in operation ; yet the ex
changes are regulated, in a manner far
better than any such machinery ever did,
or ever could, accomplish it.
EXTRACT FROM MR. PIcKEs' SPEECH
We are told that a national bank is es
sential to regulate exchanges ; and I ra
ther think this assertain has had as much
weight in the community as any other
cousidoration. Many have been induced to
believe that such was the fact. There was
never a greater fallacy. The true mean
'ing of real exchange in the difference be
tween cash and a bill drawn on a given
point. This could alone be regulated by
the state of trade between' the two points,
But, in the modern use of the term, it had
come to be considered as merely the dif
ference between bank notes of different
institutions, or the difference in the price
of bank paper. A bank note was at spe
cie par, or undet it, according to its con
versibility. Exchange is now conside
red the difference between (the capacity
of banks to convert their paper into spe
cie at one point, and their capacity at
another point. For instance : in the city
of Augusta, I believe, the banks all sus
pended except, perhaps, the Planters and
Mechanics'; and the consequence was,
that there was a conference in favor of
the paper of that institution of some 5 or 6
per cent. So that, if this be exchange,
then there was a difference of five or six
per cent in exchange from one street in
the city Augusta on another street in the
same city. The same might be said as
to the Hamburg Bank, which is on one
side of the river, and the banks on the
otherside. It is only the difference in the
price of bank paper as compared with
specie par; it is a mere absurdity to call
it exchange, and the argument founded on
it is a mere catchpenny argument. Now
in this modern sense of exchange, I lay
down the proposition, that the late U
States Bank never did equalize exchan
ges. We have heard it boldly asserted
that all this was regulated by the last
bank, as if we were to forget the past.
Now let us look at the histoty of this
matter from the records, during the full
operation of the last United States Bank.

I believe that thousands have been in
duced to think that the last United States
Bank made all these things equal. Now,
if a national bank could regulate this kind
of exchange, it could only do so by pur
suing the same course it did in 1820, and
1821, when it made the attempt. What
was then the operation? Its branches, par
ticularly in the west and south and south
west, gist possessed of the local circula
tion, and ran upon the local banks for spe
cie to strengthen the mother and central
branches at Philadelphia and New York;
the result of which would be to concen
trate all the specie of the country in its
own vaults. With its public deposits,
and the disbursements of the national re
venue,no local bank could stand its opera
tions. In 1819, 1820 and 1821, it broke
almost every bank in the west and south
west. The country was prosrated under
it; and such must inevitably be again the
operation of a central Government institu?
tion, with its branches in the remote
States. It will use the power and re
sources of the federal revenues to oppress
and ruin our local institutions. I am not
left to conjecture in this matter. It was
the history of the last bank. Mr. Biddle
avowed the policy in a communication, as
president of that institution, to a commit
tee of Congress. dated 16th April, 1832.
He used the following language:
"The whole force of the institntion was
therefore directed to strengthen that place,
(New York;) and the distant branches
were directed to avoid incommoding it,
and the Atlantic branches near to them, by
drafts upon them; but to pay their balances
to them with as little delay as the conveni
ence of their respective localities would
permit. This is the whole policy of the
bank in the last six months. It will be
seen, therefore, that without a dimunition
there is an actual increase of business in
New York. ani a large increase of the do
mestic bills at the 'ranches; the increase
in New York being for the purpose of pro
tecting the interests there, and the increase
of the remittances beitng from. the west
and the south to sustain New York and
the Northern Atlantic branches. in as
suming this part on the present occasIon,
the bank deemed itself only acting as it
was designed to act by the Congress which
created it, and placing itself in its true
natural attitude to the Government and
to the country."
I think Mr. Cheves and Mr. Biddle
htave both declared that there was no peri
od of their presidency of that institution
when they could not, if they had cho
sen, have exercised its power so as to
have prostrated any local bank they might
think proper. it is a strange infatuation
to see men eager to place the local inssitu
tions, particularly of the south and west,
at the mercy of such an institution. Are
we prepared to sacrifice our local stock
holders, who have vested their all in our
State hank., for the interest of a new ceu
tral Gov-ernment batnk? It arises from
the .delusion as to exchanges. Create
such a bank. and if it gives you a circula
tion that shall he equal everywhere, it
can only he done by making its paper
equal to gold and silver; and if it be equal
to gold and silver, it will 'hen require as
much produce, or as nyuchz of any thing,
to get it as to get gold and silver.
If your local paper be not convertable
then, it will require just as much of that
to procure the money of a United Statei
Bank as it would to procure gold and sil
ver now, or available funds. The local
paper would be just as much belowv the
United States standard as it would be be
low specie par -that is, if the United
States Bank paper should be equal every
where; and it would only be so, because
of its equality withI the specie standard.
And this I have demonstrated from the
price of banik paper which I have showsl
you in the tables presented for the differ
eat years of the existence of the last bank;
to this aight be added the cost of trans
portation of specie. Now, then, wher
you establish branches of a Rational inisti
tution, and make its circulation equal t<
gold and silver,then will commenee the sys
temn of comparing the paper of your Statt
institutions with that of the branch at the
nearest point; and the consequence will be
that private brokers will be transferred t<
the counters of the branch, and your loca
paper will be shaved there.
From its connection with the revenues
of the Government and a central institu
tion sustained by public deposies, it wil
get control of fictitious exchanges, and
as atn inevitable consequence, will sacri
fice,~ in emergency, the distant points ti
sustain the centre-it cannot be, nor evet
has ben, other-wise.- This kind ofequnal
izing exchanges is all nominal. Thern
may be only~ one half. or three-fourth,
per cent. between the branch and the en
tral institutiony but tihe circulation of the
local banks will be still below par. in es
act proportion to their convertibility at
commercial point. This was the case, al
I have shown from the tables presented
Is will take jns'the same amount of Iran
paper, or produce, to obtain the general
and equal circulation, under that system,
as it does to procure specie, with the ex
ception of the cost of transportation.
Any twp specie points are r.ow equal in
exchange, except as to cost of transporta
tion and the difference in trade. Produc
tive labor can receive no advantage, from
any other system than the preservation of
the specie standard; and that can. be done
by this government using it entirely in its
dues and disbursements, and by the States
enforcing convertibility in their local insti
tutions.

PROSPECTS OF COTTON.
Mr. Editor.-About two month's since
I offered to your readers some remarks
on the history of Cotton, founded in part
on the singular coincilence of every great
increase in the product, having invariably
been followed the next year by as great a
falling off-and I remarked that this coin
cideuce, if it be nothing more went to
strenghten the opinion prevailing amon.st
the planters, that the present crop would
not exceed 1,800,000 hales-and further,
that if the crop does not exceed that
amount, it was reasonanle to look for
higher prices-even 10 a 12 cents. That
this conclusion is not unreasonable as
will appear from the statistics below,
of the Stocks, receipts and consumption
of United States Cotton in Europe. We
will explain afterwards why the exhibit is
confined to American Cotton.
The Stock of American Cotton in
Europe on the 1st of June, 1843 s as es
timated at 448,000 b.
Receipts in Great
Britain to Sept,
30, 1,320,000
Estimated from 1st
October to the
31st December, 100,000 1,420,000
Receipts in France
to 31st August, 299,000
Estimated to 31st
December 51,000 350,000
Rest of Europe for
the year, 175.000
Total supply for '43, 2,398,000 h.
The consumption
of Great Britain
in 1842, was 962,000
increase for 1842,
estimated at
5000 bales per
week, was 260,000 1,222,000
France in 1842
was 366,000
Increase 1843, 30,000 396,000
Rest of Europe in
1842, 134,000
Increase 1843, 36,000 170,000
Total con. for 1843, 1,788,000
Stock on hand 1st
Jan. 1843 605,000
By comparing then the total supply of
American Cotton with the comsuption
for the present year, it appears that the
stock on hand in all the countries of
Europe will be on the 1st
Jan, next, 605,000 b).
If the crop of this year does
not exce-ed. 1,800.000 bales,
the United State will re
qunire 400.000-leaving for
Europe 1,400.000
and miakiog the supply for
1844 2,005,000
Consumption taken same as
1843 1,783,000
will leave stock 1st Juoe,
1845 217,000
In the statement of the supply for 1843
we have estimated the receipts ito Great
Britain from the 1st Septem I-er to the end
of the year, at 100,000 Lales-and this on
the assumption that all the Cotton expor
ted from the United States before the 1st
Decetmber, will arrive in England by the
1st January. That it will not exceed
this may be assuimed from the fact that
the average exports of the United States
for the last three years scarcely exceed
this-and up to the present time they are
less by 54,000 bales, than those of last
year.
The allowance to France of 51,000,
for the four last n-onths of this year is al
so a full one-the average export for the
last three years not exceeding this-and
up to the 6th instant there is a decrease
of-6000 hales. The shipments therefore
from this period to thp 1st December,
must greatly exceed those of last year or
any previous year, to make the receipts
into Great Brit ain equal to our estimate.
From a recapitulation of~ the foregoing
statements it appears that the year
1844 will commence with a stock of
American Cotton in Europe not exceed
ing 605.000 bales--that if the present
crop does not exceed 1,800,000 bales (the
United States requiring 400,000) there
would remain for Europe 1,400.000
which, added to stock, would make the
total supply of Europe for 1844, only
2,005,000 bales, and that if the consump
ton of 1844 be estimated without increase
as that of 1843, the stock American Cot
ton in Europe on the 1st January, 1845,
would be but 217,000 hales, or 14 tmonthe
consumption, and a less stock tbani at any
period since 1837, with a greatly increa
s ed demand.
Our observations and estimates have
bean confined to American cotton alone
for the prospects of this must rule and go.
vera all other kinds. The average sup.
ply into Europe from all other countries
for the last fi've- years has been almost
stationary, scarcely exceding 520,000
bales-and had it not been for the increa
sed production.of the U. S., the consump
tied mnust have overtaken the supply of
etton, and prices gone excessively high.
It is idle therefore to talk of-supplies from
ociber quarters having any material infiu
acea G npicne ny decisve impressioa
can only be looked for from the U. Sta
tes.
Having now given what is helkved it
be a correct view of thiuga. founded o
the most authentic sources of infornatio.
wit hin reach, is it unreasonable, we a'k
for the cotton planer to look for a better
return for his labor. We have taken the
consumption of 1844, without supposing
any increase on that of this year, and il
leaves a stock of but 217,000 bales, or e
weeks consumption at the end of the
year. But the average annual increase
of the last five years is equal to 8 per cent,
and should thie rate of increase continue
(and why should it not?) there would re
main s:arcely any stotck at all at the
close of next year-and what then if the
next prove but an average one ! Our ob.
ject is not to work up prices-but simply
to place before the planting interest such
views & facts as may enable them to judge
understandingly whether it be not thepari
of wisdom to wait the developement of
the crop before they hurry their proiuce
to market. Prices cannot well go lower,
and if the crop prove no larger than we
have estimated it, they must he higher.
The game to southern interests is a erect
one-a rise of one cent per lb. is equal tn
S millions of dollars. Unable to combine,
and having to contend with the -nosi
powerful combinations interested to oh.
tain his produe'* at the lowest posisble
price, the planter cannot too strongly feel
the necessity of studying his position and
acting n ith a full knowledge of all the
facts and influence that control the price
of his products. B. S. R.

ters, it is a fact, "that a large amount of raw
cotton of American growth was sent from
England to places beyond the Cape or Good
Hlope, in the form of cotton fabric and twist.
than the weight of East-India cotton nsed up
by the manufacturers of Great Britain." The
averag.' quantity of East India cotton spnn in
Gueat Britain in the last ten years is 30.969,
237 lbs., or estimating it ;n balesof 300 lbs.
103.280 bales. The average weight of Cloth
and Twist sent from Great Britain to places
beyond the Cape of Good Hope in 1841 and
1842. was 53,578,000 lbs. or 178.590 bales.
or 75,360 bales more than the quantity of
India Cotton used in Great Britain!! See

IV.
Speculation.-From- appearances the
people of the United States are on the
verge of speculation, more particularly
that division which is interested in the corn
merce and cultivation ofcotton. The two
causes which in the history of commercial
enterprise must co-exi-r, to produce a spir
it of speculation, are now present nearly
in all their full force to wit, a plethora of
money& the actual or expected deficiency.
of a staple of trade whose value regulates
the tmoney prices of a large number of
other commodities. The mere expecta
tion of sore deficiency, although small in
the cotton crop, in connexion with the fact
that monied capitol is on all sides secking
investment, are sufficient, in the present fe
verish state of the public mind, to produce
ex'ensive mischief, if the utmost caution
is not obser ,ed. There is, we fear, falla
cious calculation in some quarters founded
on the late stimulus given in England to
the consumption of the raw material. Its
continuance will depend on profitable re
turns fur the large exports of British man
ufactures superinduced by the opening of
new channels of trade. What is called
over-productiotn in 1844 may be the resuali
of stimulus of 1843.
The times are significant, therefore, of
m-schief. There is rest lessness in the pubh
lic miud. There is morbid desire to engage
in speculation. There is the huyamncy ol
spirit atnd elastic energy na tural to A merieni
after a season of losses. stagnation anti
depressiont. WVhat is tn preven t t he renewal
of extravagant enterprises, tunder such
provocarive and favoring circu msta nces,
but the ext retrjest caution in all those 'dhn
are able to open or close at their pleasture,
the great avenues ofecredit. We allude ol
course to the Banks. There is a feeling o1
test lessness itt their rnagers, in the pres.
ent state of limited profits, which indicate:
a sympathy with those who are from 1em
pei-amenlt atnd position, inclined to rush in
to speculation. Bamnks may check ann
cont tol or niurse atnd mature this pruriency
for cotmmercial adveuuture.
W~e do not apprehend the spread o!
speculation over so large a surface, embra
cing so comprehensive a class of person
and onijec's. as that of which the people a:
the United States have but just tasted then

Slavery in America and in Europe.-Ti
a recent work published at Paris says
the Spectator entitled "Slavery andi Li

says:
"Slavery's great fatult is itn the name
In France and int Etngland, workmen and

A Tenrible Picture.-Some of our rea
ders have seecn, no doubt, a picture in a
late number of the "Punch, or Londotn
Chativari," one of the pictorial papers,
but in the sub'ject of this etngraving there
is more foosd for-teaurs than latughtetr. It
is caleld "Capital anid Latbor." it the
upper portiotn is capital, represented bty
one of the aristocracy, sitting in his easy
chair, surrounided with the momst costly
luxuries, an:1 taking a glass of sparkling
wine from a silver salver, held by a sleek,

ladies' drawing room, fat lap-dogs are
vawning, and luxurious idaisnties are lav

Men, womeni and childr-en are seen at
wvork in nakedness arid hutnger in deep,
dark coal mines; miser'able wretches,
crippled by labor, and starving to death,
mothers glatrinig upon their emaciated in
fants, which they piress with their skele

door shtot against the wretched, with pon
derous patent locks, at which love knocks
in vain, and hope weeps but canmnot en

SLatwyers .-It appears that the number
of persons who devote themselves to the
profession of lawvs is increasing. The cat
altogie of Harvard University for the pres
ent years cottains the names,,if 120 per
sons in the law school. This i's said to be
the largest oody evet gathered together in
our country for the study of law. The
competition in the professsion will soon be
so great that we shall be able to get a greal
deal of law for very little money, whether

rights of their fellow citizens
The murderers of Mr. Vore have not
yet been arrested, and .ii is doubtful wheth
er they are in the Nation. -Several of,
their riends have gone hunting upon the
waters of white river: and it is not unlikely
that these men have gone in that direction
also.
Several prisoners have been taken to the
Council recently, under various charges,
for criminal offences. All ihat is required
to restore peace and quiet in that unhappy
country is the arrest of some dozen scoun
lrele who commit murder and robbery,
and foment excitement.

The Louisville journal has the foflew
ug notice of ant important invention:
Our frieni Dr. Somerby, one of most
skilful and scientific of dental surgeons,.
has recently invented a retnarkablf use
ful apparatus especially designed for den
tists, but capable of being applied to ma
ny kinds of business. It is a combina
tion of the bellows, furnace. and a blow
pipe of the simplest and most ingenious
custruecion, an, it must commend itself
at once to every one capable of apprecia
ting such things. We saw an exhibition
of sme of its power last Saturday even
ing. and found it even more than we had
anticipated. To deutists, jewellers, che
mists, opticians, ceologists, mineralogists,
mneta lurgists, and for various experiments
itn colleges, antd fr every thing requiring
a steady hteat from te blowpipe, we re
grd this as one of the most valuable im
provemneasts we have seeni, and we advise
alt iterestedl ini an apparatus of the kind to
call on Dr. Somrerby and see the instru
ment, It is not onuly a highly useful
apparatns, but one of the neatest ever put
up.
\Ve untderstand that ihe apparatus will
soon0 he takes ton the East fur she inspec
tiin of d'entists. and we are confident they
will hightly approve it and find thteir inte
rests greatly promoted by the use ofit in
their- professiont. We bespeak for it tho
favrable conisideration of the Eastern
press.

Singular Phenomnenon.-Oa Moniday
night hetwecen the hout's .oh'11 and 12 o'
clock, a rumbling ntoise, sounding like
distant thunder, was heared by a-nmber
of our citizens, preceded by several flash
es of light. We supposed from the sha
king~ of our houise, that it was the shnelt
of an earihquake. Butt have since been.
informned, by persons who saw theg ph.
nomenon, that tt was a Meteor m the
H eavens. The explosion took place about
10 minutes after the sudden flashes of lightk
appeared. The weathes appeared to be,
clear, andl moon shone beautifully.

where they are to remamt. It may also.
be done tupout peicesof roots to about 3-4mba
of an inch in diameter and less, either by
letting the roots remainxor separating, and
after grafting r:eplanting them. No comn
positon is required; the yarn by which
the gra ft and ritot are tied together will not
