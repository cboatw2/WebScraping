PROPER TIME or CUTTING WHEAT.
The period of maturity mast proper in
every respect for the cutting of wheat
has long been a subject of discussion ?
So long as wheat was thrashed by hand,
it was found necessary to let it ripen fully,
or the loss io thrashing would exceed the
gain from any other source; but since
machines have been generally introduced,
^ this difficulty has passed away, and the
^ question placed on other grounds. It is
now, how does early cutting affect the
weight and quantity of grain and the qua!,
ity of flour, as compared with that har*
vested at a later period? Many experi.
ments have been made to test and settle
thin matter, but the best and most satis,
factory are have seen, are those detailed
in the last No, of the Q. J. of Agriculture
made by Mr. Hanoam, of Yorkshire, an
intelligent and able farmer. Mr. Hannam
selected for his experiment a field of
the old xquareheaded red reheat, and on
the 4th of August, 1840, cut a sheaf.?
Both straw and ears were green and full
of sap. The grain was perfectly formed,
but the chaff adhered firmly to it, and it
was bo soft and full of milk, that the
lightest pressure reduced the whole to a
pulp. This sheafstood in the field a fort,
night, when it was housed, and the same 1
day, August 18th another cut. In this
the wheat was not ripe, but what is called
"ratfl." The straw for a foot from the 1
ground ww y^Uow, and abovq tbat, <
though to appearance green, still was
taming yellow. The grain though still <
aft and masheo easily, was not near so \
Mt-fftaid or milk as before. At the I
end of a fortnight this sheaf was housed, |
and September I, or the same day another ,
was cut This last sheaf was ripe, the ,
fcraw uniformly yellow, but not so ripe as
to have the heads break, or grain fall 1
out and the end of a fortnight this was
also housed. Each sheaf was carefully
preserved, and Anally thrashed and the
chaff separated, by itself. The gross
weight was ascertained by an accurate
balance, as was that of a Axed measure,
and an equal number of the grains. The
result wasas follows, the experiment of
weighing beiwg several tunes repeated to
prevent error:
Time of Gross Equal Equal no.

Aug. 16. (raw) 716 5NU 23 1-4.
Sept. I, (ripe,) 650 570 221-4.
100 straw* of an equal length were
then selected from each of the bundles,
and weighed as follows:
Green 550
Raw , 475
Ripe 450
To ascertain the actual value of each
quality, samples of .each were exhibited
to an exteosive wheat grower, and then
put into the hands of a factorand miller,
to know what they would give. The
opinion of the grower and the miller was
as below:?
Value per qua. by Value per qua. by
the wheat grower. the miller.
Green 61s 61s.
Raw 64s 63s.
Ripe 62s 62*.
ft appears from these experiments that
the "raw" wheat had the advantage over
the ripe" in every respect?
1st, weight of gross produce,
13 1-5 perct.
2d, weight equal measure 1-2 44
3d, weight equal number
of grains, 2 1-5 44
4th, in quality and value, 3 1-4 44
6th, in weight of straw, 5 44
The "ripe" had the advantage over the
"green" in every respect hut that of the
straw, in which the green had an advantage
of 22 per cent.
Mr. Hannam estimates the comparative
value of the whole crop on an acre of
each kind as follows:
Green ?11 11 10
Raw 13 7 3
Ripe 12 17 3
Our readers will judge of these experi.
ments for themselves; but we must add,
there are other considerations of great
weight in favor of cutting wheat before
it is "dead ripe." These, more time for
securing the crop ; less waste in harvesting
from the shelling of the grain ; and
a better quality of straw, a thing of no
snwU consequence where it is us cjtcp.
I sively used for feeding stock, as in our b
wheat growing districts. It is also the ci
opinion of millers, we believe universally, aj
that early cut grain makes far better b
flour than that which becomes fully ripe K
before cutting. It is probable the same ri
facts would hold good of barley, rye, oats, le
&c., and it would 9eem desirable that si
farmers should ascertain these points, as d>
small profits, or small losses, in the ag. r<
gregate, are the things that make, or ruin, hi
the .cultivator of the soil. w
There is a great waste by many in har. a
vesting grain from using bad implements,
not paying attention to putting it up prop,
erly in the field when cut, and performing
all parts of the work in a slovenly and
unfarmerlike manner. There is a vast
deal of wheat and other grain, put into
the barn or stack after rains, or before the
straw or green matters the sheaves may Jj
contain are cured, in such a state that c<
the centra] parts of the sheaf heat, mold ^
and become nearly rotten. The result
is bad wheat, musty and poor flour, all ^
which might be avoided by care in the &
several processes through which the crop si
passes. at

IMPROVING LAND WITH OATS. ^
Science Grove, Davidson Co, N, C, ) .
July 23, 1841. ) ei
Mr. Editor? Vn extract quoted in No. M
7 of the Farmer's Advocate, has called m
forth this communication, as a verification fa
of the principle there held forth: the ai
application of oats as a paramount and vi- M
tai restorative of the soil, where it has w
received the matricidal poinard of the ?
land killer to its heart; enabling it, phce- di
nix like, to spring forth in virgin beau- ^
ty, even from the ashes of its own de- 'u
struction. Jj
Clover has long been celebrated for its
fertilizing properties. Oats has not, as ^
yet, had such strong recommendation in ^
its favor; yet nevertheless I think when m
its properties, as such, have become suffi- ??
ciently known, and tested, if it does not $(
gain an equal footing, it will become a fii
vice-clover, as a renovator of the soil. I w<
will state my theory and support it with br
em experiment, and leave the reader to gt
iraw his own inference. y<
j , So# vour Gi
rats at the common time, ana in ine asuat ~
manner, only, sow something like a half ^
bushel more seed to the acre, and after ?
they are plowed or harrowed in as the
case may he, roll the ground with a light rj,
roller. Let it stand until about two ^
thirds of the grain in the head is ripe.
Then roll it down, and double plow it ar
under, taking care that the point of the th
gouge reaches ten inches below the sur- re
face*. Roll the ground as before. (Not m
that I think that after rolling benefits fur- th
ther than this,?it renders the surface in a hi
situation for all the oats to be rolled
down when required. I suppose it fur- w
ther renders service, by keeping the ele- 18
vated ridges left by the plow from exces- 8
sive evaporation.) Let it lay until about ^
two weeks before you wish to sow your ^
wheat; t en roll down the oats, and (j|
again double, plow them under as before ;
sow your wheat and harrow it in, and I'll ^
warrant you an advance of at least 100 y
per cent on your wheat crop, independent ^
of its future benefit; which will doubtless fc
exceed that of the wheat crop. b(
I will now relate my experiment.? w
About the first of July 1840, I selected g<
1 *~-l nnlnt in AIM ?f TT1V Oat W
a very eicrmcu pui... ... ?..w
fields to make an experiment. I mens, fi
ured off a quarter of an acre and double al
plowed the oats under, and let it remain
until two weeks before to sow my wheat. ^
I then double plowed the young sward of 81
oats under, and harrowed my wheat in.? .
The rest of the field I fallowed by double jj
plowing, and put it in at the same time I ^
did the oat patch, (for so I termed my ex. 5
perimental piece.) At harvest I cradled c
the experiment piece to itself, and also, a M
quarter of an acre lying by the side of it, si
to test the experiment; off the oat patch, a
I saved 13 dozen of wheat, which would t!
average 3 bushels to the 100 sheaves; and e
off the test quarter 1 saved 7 doz. which n
would not make more than 2 3-4 bushels 8
to the 100; making an advance of 100 *
per cent, on the experimental piece. A
profit not to be spurned at. Unavoida.
ble circumstances prevented me from [
threshing it out seperately and testing the
experiment by a non dobiotu rule, though (
I have not an earthly doubt, that if it had
been tested by threshing, it would have
increased the assumed advance in favor of
the oat system.
The system appears excellent in every
point of view for a wheat crop; the
wheat is sown in the first stratum of man. j
ure, formed by the first crop of oats,
which furnish an abuundant store of no.
tritive matter for the upper class of roots ,
of the wheat; the under set, receive their
nourishment from the Inst crop of oats
while in its state of decomposition, which
renders them an equal quantity ofvcgeta.
* Land should uevor be plowed deeper than
the soil unless the manure applied at the time
is sufficient to convert into soil or loam the
earthturneq up."::i;
le matter as the first does to the upper ft
lass; and preserves the crop as secure b
gainst drought, as though it received the ^
enefit of the Egyptian reservoirs of the *'
liie. But gentle reader make the expe- *
ment if ye list, for yourself, and then at ^
sisure draw your own inference, If I have ^
iggested a plan, whereby you at a future tj
ay, may with pleasure look over your s|
^novated fields and luxuriant crops, I r<
ave then gained the summit of my p
ishes, and the most lofty eminence of *
i y ambition. tl

ngland, where the best cattle are pro* fi
iced, the prices are much better than in g

gumentto show, that the farmers of n
is country shonld use every exertion to li
ar the best stock. There are indeed *
any arguments tor Tenneseeans to turo "
eir attention to stock farming. Cotton ?
is measurably failed, and as for tobacco, A
U morally wrong to encourage it; it ?
ill exhaust much of our land, and what ?
still worse, it is by no means probable n
bor will be repaid for cultivating it. tl
lost herbage plants flourish finely in g
ennesee, and we can always find a cer- d
* 0 ,
tin market for what stock would pro* ?
ice. We do not expect to live to see p
le day when the best of animals will not ii
ring good prices for breeders alone. ^
/hen me speak of breeders, we do not d
lean every animal should be turned out h
>r this purpose. The best alone should f
e used. The noble Durhams have al- a
ays been much injured, by turning out *
nod, bad, and indifferent for breeders ; I
hen in fact, if out of 20 bull calves, we t
nd one which will barely do to keep, we I
re lucky. The Berkshire hogs will soon i
e much injured by turning out every 1
ung as a breeder. The English have i
icceoded better than all the world, in i
31ecting the beet for breeders and keep- i
ig them well, and we must follow the I
K&mpie, to get the character of scientific <
reeders. In addition to rearing for <
reeders, we should make at least, butter I
heese, and beef for home consumption, 1
rhich we have never done, and then we <
houldhave something to send to our I
outhcrn friends, who will never produce '
beir own eatables. These facts clearly
vince to us, that this must be a farming, '
tot a -planting country, and that good 1
tock will always bring fair price. We I
hink the farmer who now has first-rate
ireeders, of either cattle, sheep, or bogs. <
von Id act foolishly to sell tbem at reduced <

ENGLISH TURNIPS.
The common turnep. usually called the
English or flat turnep, to destinguish it,
from the Swedish or rata bagn, is a valuable
root, and better adapted to the table
than any other turnep, and is consequently
deserving a place on every farm.?
There are many varieties, of which the
Norfolk and Globe are as productive as
any. while some of the smaller kinds, among
which the long turnep holds a prominent
place, ore best for cooking. The
soil best calculated for the turnep is a rich
mould abounding injmatter, and newly
cleared lands arc found admirably adapted
to their growth, the soil being usually
ee from weeds, and the ashes made by
uruing being one of the best dressings
mt can be applied to turneps. Where
ich lands are not to be had, old grass
ma carefully turned over and rolled, and
ten the surface made line by repeated
arrowings, for the reception of the seed,
re found to produce good turneps. If
ie soil is not rich, good compost manure
bould be spread on the surface and har>
jvred in, but as old grass laods in richness
artake somewhat of the quality of new
?ils, manuring is rarely necessary, and in
ie decaying sward the vigorous tap root
f the turnep finds ample nourishment.
Turneps may be sown broadcast or
filled, the latter being the preferable
ray; and if a little bone dust or poudrette
i drilled 'in with the seed, the plants
tart more vigorously, and are sooner out
f the way of their most formidable ene.
ly, the fly. There is usually far more
?ed sown than is necessary, if equally
istributed* aod to facilitate this mixing
le seed with ashes or sand is practised
y many farmers. English writers state
ue quantity of seed required per acre at
wo pounds* but we know by experience
lat one-half this quantity of good seed on
roper soil is hotter than the whole* and
'ere the distribution perfect* one-fourth
lis quantity or half a pound would fully
sed an acre. It is better*however, to err on
le safe side, and sow too much* rather
lan too little seed* as if too thick the
oung plants may be hoed or pulled out.
'he proper time of sowing will of course,
ary with the (attitude. In New.York,
le best time has been found to be from
le 20th to the 27th of July; in the midle
and southern parts of Pennsylvania*
rom the last of July to the middle of Auust;
aod in Verginia, from the middle
) the last of August is presrred.
The turnep* when grown on land
>ng cultivated, is apt to have the butb aticked
by the worm* but in virgin soils,
r those rarely subjected to cultivation,
lis evil does not attend them. Dresings
of soot and ashes have been found
seful when they are attacked by the fly,
nd in any event such dressings operate
ivorably on the plant and may therefore
e beneficially employed when there is
le least reason to apprehend danger.

THIS PEACH?IMPORTANT EXPERIMENT.
Messrs. Gaylord dt Tucker.-?In the
WTPt* to Judge Buel.
le Peach Tree with Salt Petre, and pioosed
to give the result through the medim
of the Cultivator to the public. I
ave as my reason for that request; that
i far as my observation extended, I had
I ways observed that on soils containing
itre and muriatic of soda* the Peach tree
vea luxuriantly to an advanced age*
'hile upon soils immediately adjoining*
ninature decay takes place, and the tree
eldom attains the age of seven years.?
la instancesjin vindication of this occuring
o frequently, I have been astonished to
ee them passed ever without notice, and
ow advert to some of them to establish
tie truth of this position. Peach trees
rowing in the site where once stood a
welling, generally live to an old age, the
oil of which, by analysis, will give a proortion
of nitre. The same thing occurs
11 many districts of the West and South
Vest; upon one farm the occupant has no
lifficulty in having good peaches, while
lis neighbor finds it a laborious task to
irolong the life of the tree to a few years,
ind on igell cultivated farms near the
teaboard, I have been informed, they
lave but little difficulty in growing (his
ree. Having these and other instances
or my guidance, I commenced experinents
with salt and saltpetre, in the year
1836, upon an orchard six years old; clo.
rer was sowed upon it that spring, and it
emained in grass till Inst fall, when it
vas ploughed and sown wheat, and clover
his spring. The trees in *36 were full
>f worms; some of the trees were dead,
>thers apparently dying, and but very

was its distempered condition that some
:>f my friends advised me to cut down a?
bout one-half of these that yet showed
life, saying that such was the practice ol
Peach growers. I thought it would be a
bad practice for a physician to destroy
one or more of a family to prevent disease
from spreading, and after cutting dowr
those that were dead, I commenced operations
on the balance with equal quantities
of salt and salt petre combined, applying
about a half a pound upon the surface
and in contact with the trunk of the tree;
then sowed it broadcast over part of the
orchard, at the rate of about two bushel;
per acre. The result of this applicatior
to the surprise of my friends, was the ap
pearanc of perfect health, white new anc
^ r..n _r r.?;t
vigorous shoots, tne ireesiuu ui
which matured with increased size ant
improved flavor. Towards the last o
March, and again in May and September
1837,1 applied the same ingredients ir
different proportions without observing
much difference in the effect; though I
have since thought that where I applie<
the salt petre alone, and where the larges
portion of the mixture was nitre, the effec
??oo Koa?. hut in ronseauence of the pric<

"1
of salt petre, I have endeavored to ascer
tain the smallest quantity that should b<
used, and I would not advise leas thai
one-eighth, though I should prefer one
fourth, or more. My trees this fall (1837,
$ '*
were free from worms, all doing well, tod I r
have found no further use for the axe in f
the orchard. In the year 1638,1 applied o
the mixtnre to a part of my orchard in f
March, the other part received the appli a
cation in June and September; upon that c
part done in March, I had an abundance p
of fruit, while those done in the 6th and 'J
8th months were comparatively destitute b
of fruit, it having been killed by a late t
frost. It occured to me that I was indeb. e
ted to the salt, &c., for the abundance of c
fruit on the trees done in March, by its t
retarding vegetation : and from au exper. (
iment made in *77, it appeared to be the I
case, though I have never considered it ]
of sufficient importance to repeat it for the ]
purpose of testing it further. t
In regard to the best time to make this r
application, I would say about the first of ,
April, and to those trees having worms i
in them again in June or September, as t
the appearance of the worm may indicate i
its necessity, using about two?thirds of
the usual quantity for the June or Sep. ?
tember dressing, and to be used only in i
contact with the trunk of the tree. 1 j
have not discovered any great benefit ]
from sowing it broadcast over the orchard
* ??f<?. tn J/v (kio attar v a PI*, i

or third year. If the tree is injured <
very much by the worm, to wash the bark |
of the trunk with a ablution of this mix* .
ture, and water might be of service, be* <
ing careful not to apply too much ; this i
should not prevent its application in pow*
dered state. To my trees planted in the i
fall and spring, I apply as soon as done (
planting in the spriog about one ounce
upon the surface, in contact with the
trunk of the tree, and repeat this quantity ,
again early in June or September, the
Peach'worm at these two last periods-being
in their infancy, are destroyed*1
In August, after one application of this
mixture to my young trees in the spring,
I havo taken several worms from off the
outr bark of a tree, bedded in gum, they
have punctured it in a number of places,
but did not penetrate to do any injury
to the inner bark, while the next tree left
without the above mixture was nearly des*
troyed, the inner bank being eaten for
more than two-thirds around the tree. It
might be supposed that the salt and salt
petre would produce instantaneous death,
hut this is not the case ; I have kept them
half covered in a solution of salt and water,
and salt petre and water, and in these
two articles combined for several hours
its approach, and will not remain ft it no*
less compelled by necessity.
In compliance with the promise heretofore
made, I have endeavored to give in
a brief manner my practice on the Peach
tree for five years, from which I have no
reason to make a change, but many inducements
for a continuance of the practice.
If you consider it sufficiently important
for publication, it is at your disposal,
and if any benefit should arise
therefrom, be assured it would be the
highest reward for any service of mine
that could be tendered to, dear sirs, your

~ MR. CAMPBELL'S SPEECH.
Speech of the Hon. John Campbell, of
South Carolina, on the bill 'relating to
Duties and Drawbacks. Delivered in
the House of Representatives of the United
States. July 26,1841.
(Continued from last week.)
I cannot say that I entertain great objections
to the principles of the present
bill, for, although it exempts from duty
certain articles that are used in domestic
manufactures, and thus may be consider.

as provided for by the act of 18Sf* commonly
called the compromise act?-an act
to which the State that I have the honor,
in part, to represent, assented, and which
brought peace to her then distracted
counsels. How far it may be found
uracticable to carry out the principle of
home valuation, provided for in that act,
consistently with that provision of the
Constitution which prescribe* a uniformity
of duties in all our porta, it b not necessary
now to discuss. M Sufficient for the
day is the evil thereof."
I find upon this occasion a bill presented
to my consideration, based upon revenue
principles, which, if it becomes a law,
will operate with aa much equality
throughout the Union aa almost any tariff
that can be devised, and trhich, upon its
face, is not violative of the principles of
the compromise act. But while in candor
I ma'ce these admissions, I will ask
gentlemen whether they regard it to be
in accordance to the spirit of the Compromise
act, which provides that no more
money shall be raised from customs than
shall be found necessary for an economical
administration of the Government, to distribute
a portion of the public revenue
among the States, that the anticipated
deficiency thereby, in part, created may
be supplied by a tax upon our foreign
commerce? The passage of this bill
would probably have a considerable influence
in promoting the passage of the land
! distribution bill through the Senate; and
can I, while that bill is still pending, vote
for the passage of Ibis, without appearing
to give a sanction to the fraud, 1 do not

ting a portion of the pubTic revenue
among the States, not only at a time of
acknowledged deficiency in the Treasury,
hut when the credit of the Government
is actually pledged to the amount
of $17,000,000, to enable this Administration
to conduct our finances?thus laying
the foundation of a national debt,
which will hereafter afford the irresistible
argument of necessity for heavy dutie*
upon our importations?
The present bill is also liable to objections
in its details, among the most prominent
of which is the duty on eo4rso>
