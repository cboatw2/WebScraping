fWli I K success of the SOUTHERN TON 1C is
unprecedented. It has neen anxiously sought
after by all persons in every part of the United
States, and its widely extended distribution has
been owing to the many requests received from
every section of the South and South West. Although
it ori ffinalrd in nn uliueore ? r? iifllie rnnn.
try but a few years since, it is now found in nil the
principal towns and villages in the Union, and its
virtues as a cure for Ague and Fever, and as a
general Tonic, are appreciated by all who have
used it. Being ns it prnft<stu*9 a - compound of
Southern Vegetables, it is needless to offer the assurance
that there is no .Arsenic,Mercury, nor any
tiring in the least hurtful to the human constitution
in it. If will be found a valuable Medic.no
in all cases of Dyspepsia and di ^organised Stomach
and Bowels, and patients convalescing from iljious
Fever, will derive the most important benefits
from the use of the Southern Tonic. It may
be administered to children and infants of the most
tender age with the utmost splety. Prepared by
Coster and Coxe at their Labratory, at Mantgoinely

From the general embarrassment of the times ;
the deranged si.afe of the domestic exchanges, and
the difficulties attending the disposal of Hank Hills
out of their immediate circles of issue, we have
been solicited by agents and Venders to postpone 1
lite drawing of the above scheme, for a short time,
until the present crisis in the uilairs of the coun*
try shall have passed a ay.
We have therefore yielded to these solicitations, j
and postpone the drawing of the Alexandria C-.t!--ry,
ci.<tss K, from the 27ili of Amy, to the 2Ud day
of September next, when the drawing will posilively
take place.
Adventurers having purchased tickets in said j
class, and who do not wish to hold the in ur.til the
drawing, can have their money returned by the
agent oi broker from vvlioin thev purchased?or can
exchange them for tickets in classes to be drawn
at an earlier day, as it may suit their pleasure.
The Managers have consented to this postpone
ment with extreme reluctance, as it has always'
been their policy to draw every scheme at the time
announced. '1 ho unparalleled state of the country,
is the only cause of this one departure from
the usual custom
All the oilier schemes now before the public, will

J T)r. A. Jones?Sir, In reply to your enquiry,
what 1 think of your improved Cotton Gin, I have
to say, that I saw it work on Saturday the25th inst.
and was very much pleased with its perloimance.
The mere fact of its self-feeding, seems to ine to
be a very valuable improvement', and besides, the .
quality of the cotton, as it comes out of the pro- 1
cess, appeared to me to bo better and cleaner than
from the common Gins in use, and that it saves
considerably in labor. Respectfully, Ac.

Dr. A Jones?Dear Sir, in reply to your note,
accompanied by a specimen of the cotton, ginned
by your Patent Gin, I beg leave to observe, that it
exhibits a decidt d improvement on the usual process
of ginning; delivering the staple uninjured
and free from hap or trash, clean and of gocd color
; thereby giving the article an additional value
These favoruble impressions of the adyantages cf
your Patent Gin, have been confirmed by subsequently
witnessing it in operation. The utility of
the double cylinders and saving of labor, will be
reudily perceived and properly appreciated by the

Feeling a deep interest in the success of all improvements
tending to benefit the important staples
of our country, I trust that yours will meet with
the encouragement it justly merits.
