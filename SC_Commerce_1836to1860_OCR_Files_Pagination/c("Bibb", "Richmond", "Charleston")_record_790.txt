‘ with the word ofGod. This commendable prtc
tice produced a degtteof solemnity in the people,
that assisted him much in the impressions which
he wished to make.
He laboured to promote the sanctification of
his hearers, both by his addressee in the pulpit,
and his faithful instructipn® in private. To ac
complish this great object, he fisted, watched,
and prayed, iu season and out of season, both
day end night. The fervency of his prayers,
aud the greatness of his zeal, were unparallelled.
While he was with us at Nottingham, it was his
regular practice to rise at 4 o’clock in the morn
ing during the summer months, and at five in the
wmter. The first of his waking hours was de
voted to earnest intercessions in behalf of his
family, and friends, the Church and the wenrid,
and for a blessing on his own ministry. The
next hour he attended the morning prayer meet
ing; hut if it was a day on which there was
none, ne would remain in his study, reading the
scriptures, and studying for the edification of his
flock. In this manner, he spent the forenoon ol
every day, seasoning all his exercises with much
prayer. The whole of the afternoon was gen
erally appropriated to visiting the sick and poor
of the society. Into whatever house he went, it
' was a point of conscience to him not to leave it
without praying. It appeared as though he
could scarcely bear to live unless he was made
useful. He often entreated the Lord that he
might be delivered from that bitter cup,—a use
less life. Indeed, his feelings were such as can
not be described. I have frequently heard him
declare in meetings, that he could almost wish
“himself accursed from Christ,” if souls might
but be saved.—John Clarke.

MISSION SKETCHES.
•" SECOND SABBATH.
* On this day we have water enough, having to
cross and recross rivers four times. Taking a boat
just at our own door, we cross over to the opposite
island, where a horse meets us. Ride seven or
eight miles, and crossing another river, a mile more
brings us to the plantation. And here we may as
well give an item of expense, which though small
at first, in the course of the year proves rather a
serious affair to the pocket of the missionary. Our
ferriage costs twenty-five cents each trip, and as we
are obliged to cross this river two Sabbaths in every
m round, at the end of the year you perceive, it will
make a very handsome missionary contribution.
We would advise future missionaries who may be
sent here, to purchase a canoe, and be their own
boatmen. On reaching the opposite shore, on one
occasion, we had to walk very nearly the whole dis
tance, and were by no means singular in this re
spect, as other missionaries can testify. This is
owing mostly to the forgetfulness or tardiness of
the negroes, but on this Sabbath we had an admira
ble specimen of mulishness, and by the way were
served a very sorry trick, which we do not care to
have repeated. After waiting an hour, here came
the mule, moving at the very slowest possible pace.
We heaved a sigh or two, for we knew what was
coming, expecting to be very much like the Hiber
nian working his passage on the canal. As we had
some little time to spare, we concluded to let his
muleship use his pleasure; so throwing the rope
upon his neck, we abandoned ourself to reflection,
and had thus quietly moved along the road for some
distance, when suddenly a burst of thunder star
tled us from our reverie. Turning our head with
the exclamation “ bless me, there it comes,” we
proceeded to use the argumenlum ad baculum, the
only one which the quadruped known as a planta
tion mule has much respect for. By dint of great
exertion, at last we succeeded, but even then it was
provoking, to see how he still seemed inclined not
to hufty himself. But we knew not what was in
store, or we should have been contented with our
snail’s pace, and with merely getting wet, ("where
was your umbrella 1” we had one, but it was some
thing in the sieve line.) A half mile more and we
should reach the house, when the mule proceeded
to form an angle of inclination of some 45°, which
of coure disturbed our centre of gravity, and caused
ns to measure our length in the sand. Our first
thought was gratitude to God it was no worse ; the
second to leave the mule, and take to our own con
veyance, but the final conclusion, was to remount,
and, with the exception of the fall, try it again.
The writer had read of Balam’s ass speaking,—
could he have beleived it possible for any thing of
the kind to laugh, he should have supposed his
polite friend about to indulge himself at his ex
pense, from the manner in which he stood and look
ed at him, as he picked himself up out of the sand.
We reached the house, and were assured by the
negro who was waiting for us, that “dat was a
berry slow goin mule.” We had found that out. !
“De boy lam um so;” a very apt scholar he
proved.
Well what’s to be done now; another river to
cross; still raining, wet, &c. At this juncture a
certain indistinct vision of old father J. on the con
ference floor, with his “ what! a Methodist preach
er afraid of rain,” together with better considera
tions as we hope our readers will charitably con
culde, induced us to continue. Proceeding to dry
our clothing, and to remove the sand (for we had
not left that in the state we found it,) from our per
son, we thought standing over a fire in the month
of August, with fever in prospect, no enviable situ
ation.

BURKE MISSION.
To Rev. W. Capers, Corresponding Secretary of the
Missionary Society of the Methodist E. Church, for
the Southern Conferences.
Dear Brother,—This communication contains
my report of the state of Burke Mission, for the
2nd and 3rd quarters of the conference year.
During this time, I have been regularly endea
voring to prosecute the work of the missionary with
.some encouragement. The two last quarters,
80 were admitted on trial, 2 expelled, 3 dropped.
So you perceive, as regards numbers we are on
gaining ground.
At the sabbath appointments, the congregations
are usually, moderately large, attentive, well dis
posed, and decent in their behaviour, while at
church. Owners are waking up, more and more, to
the importance of the moral and religious training
of their servants. Many have learned by experi
ence, that not only the negroes are morally and
religiously benefited by the faithful and indefatiga
ble labours of the Missionary, but that their tem
poial interest is promoted by it. One overseer said
v. to the missionary some time back, you have helped
me make my crop; for since you commenced
preaching here, there has been a great alteration.
The negroes do their work faithfully, and are not
eye-servants; he remarked also, that they formerly
were noted for wickedness and villany. Such re
sults were brought about under the blessing of God,
by the preaching ofthe goapel. May God continue
to giro success to missionary labour every where
Amen. David Thompson. ..

“ MISSIONARY NOTICE.
The brethren who are missionaries to the alave
population in either of the conferenoea, are affec
tionately requested to address their letters to the
Missionary Secretary, at the office of the Southern.
Southwestern, or Richmond Christian Advocate—
when they intend auch letters for publication in
either of those papers. They will please mark the
addresaon the back of their letters so as to put them
to the care of the Editor; who will have the kind
ness to open such letters, and dispose of them by
publishing, or hy forwarding them to me at Charles
ton, So. Ca. Postage paid by the Missionary
Society. -
The brethren are particularly requested to keep
in view the following points, in all their official
correspondence, viz: The number admitted on
trial—Baptised—Taken into full-connection—dur
ing the Quarter. And how many have died, moved
away, been set aside or expelled, during the Quar
ter. And, with equal particularity, How many have
been added to the number of children receiving cat
echetical instruction, or have died, or been removed,
during the Quarter. Letters giving information
on these several points, will be esteemed valuable,
though ever so short; but if wanting on these
points, they will be deemed defective.
At the close of the conference year, and before
going to conference, it is earnestly requested for
each Missionary to send a letter to the Secretary,
at the office of either of the Christian Advocates, in
which, besides giving the usual statement of the
whole number of church members, and children
catechised in his mission, he will please add a state
ment of, How many have been admitted on trial,
Have been Baptised, Have been taken into full
connection, Have died, Have been set aside or ex
pelled, or Have moved away, during the conference
year. And, also, How many have been added to
the lists of children catechised, and How many of
the children have died, or been removed, during the
conference year.
It will be gratifying, and may be useful, if the
brethren will also furnish, with their next annual
reports, the probable number«of the entire colored
population, of all descriptions, in the bounds of
their several missions. Each missionary giving, as
nearly as he can ascertain upon inquiry on the spot,
the whole number living in all the plantations within
reach of his mission round.

THE FREE SCOTCH CHURCH.
We are not sure that we can answer satisfac
torily the questions proposed by our correspondent
at Mobile, in reference to the subject of patronage
in the Scotch Church. It is not to be denied that
there is some fog about the Caledonian hills, and a
stranger is likely to be bothered in finding his
way. However we freely impart what light we
have on the subject.
The right of presentation to livings, in lay pat
rons, was recognized by the old practice of the
Scotch Church, Brande tells us, with the exception
of the period from 1690 to 1712; during which, lay
patronage was abolished and the right of presenta
tion lodged in the land-owners and members of the
kirk session. In 1712, lay patronage was restor
ed; but still under the control of the parishioners,
whose call (as it was termed) was necessary to
ratify the presentation. But the call gradually
became a mere nominal ceremony ; and disregard
to the expressed wishes of the parishioners in
one or two instances was the cause of the great
secession from the Scottish kirk. In 1834, by an
act of Assembly, the right of the parishioners was
fully revived, it being expressly enacted that the
disapproval of the majority should invalidate the
presentation. This action of the ecclesiastical
court, called the Veto Act, the court of session, a
secular court, has set aeide, on the plea that it in
terferes with the civil rights of patrons. The in
terference of the civil courts by way of limiting or
barring the right of a Christian church to the
choice of a ministry such as shall most effectually
serve its declared purposes, has been justly con
sidered by the seceding portion of the Scotch
Church as an invasion by Cesar upon the crown
rights of Christ; and thus it has occasioned their
withdrawal from the establishment. Our corres
pondent will observe one thing however. There
is a strongly-marked difference between the usages
of Scotch and English presentation. In England,
the patron can only present to a living, a clerk
already ordained; while in Scotland, the Presbytery
ordains those who have been already presented to
vacant livings. So that the consideration of the
suitableness of the candidate in point of gifts,
grace, and usefulness, comes necessarily to be
considered after his being presented and before
his actual establishment in the living. Now this
claim of the church to the exclusive right of de
termining the qualification for establishing the
ministerial relation between any presentee and
a particular flock, is denied to the Scotch Church,
as we have already seen, by the decision of the
secular courts. Lord Brougham has furnished an
illustration of the extent to which the secular
power has pushed its opposition to the indepen
dence of the church, by supposing the following
case. “Suppose a man is presented to a parish in
the Highlands, where they speak nothing but
Gaelic, and he knew not a word of the language, the
Presbytery would not have the right to object to the
man as unsuitable!”
But even beyond this point had matters gone.
Since the Auchterarder decision, in which the
court of session asserted authority over spiritual
rights, church proceedings are all to be subject to
legal revision; so that if the courts judge that a
church-sentence, even of deposition from the min
istry, is not warranted by the reasons assigned,
they claim the power of annulling the sentence, on
the alleged ground that there is no power or right
independent of law. This fact will furnish an
answer to the second difficulty proposed by our
correspondent And as matters now stand in the
established church of Scotland, the patron may
force upon any congregation, not only an unac
ceptable and uncalled man, but one who has been
actually deposed by the very Presbytery which is
subsequently called on to receive him. Uuder
these circumstances, we think the seceding por
tion of the General Assembly did no more than
their duty in throwing off the shackles of state
bondage imposed upon them by continuing in the
establishment, although in doing this they neces
sarily gave up the pecuniary emoluments at the gift
of the state.
In thus approving the course adopted by the ad
herents of the Free Church in Scotland, it may
be asked, if we perceive not a latent imputation on
our own system of ministerial appointments ! If,
as Mr. Guthrie, one of the Scottish delegation to
ask aid in England, said in an energetic speech
delivered in the Wesleyan Centenary Hall in
June last,—“in the matter of a minister’s choice,
as in a matrimonial choice, there must be consent
on both sides—why then, it might be asked, does
not the M. E. Church give to the separate con
gregations making up its circuits and stations the
privilege of a choice of their ministers 1 We an
swer that this would undoubtedly be done if the
relation between the parties in our polity, were one
for life, or for a term of many years. But with us,
two years constitute the extreme limit of pastoral
connection between a minister and his flock; and
the appointing power is lodged in the hands, not of
a secular patron, but of an ecclesiastical officer who
is held to a strict and high responsibility for the
exercise of this solemn function. And moreover,
this is a feature of our ecclesiastical economy
which has worked to well, that the laity would
sooner see any other conceivable change made
in our system, rather than that ihit should be touch
ed. Besides, we may press the consideration ad
verted to by the Rev. Mr. Beecham who addressed
the meeting at the same time with Mr. Guthrie.
“As a Wesleyan, he concurred in the maintenance
of the non-instruBion principles, which claimed
that the people ought to have a right in the choice,
ot their ministers. There might be a difference
of opinion as to the best way of applying it. But
he did not hesitate to say that the Wesleyans en
joyed at least as full a measure of non-intrusion
as was contended for by the Scotch Church. In
Scotland, the popular voice is not heard until the
settlement of a ministerhis first introduction into
the position of a licentiate or probationer being by
the exclusive act of the ministers; but in the Wes
leyan Church, no candidate is even taken on trial
until the Quarterly Meeting of his circuit, which i
is chiefly composed of laymen, has expressed ap
probation of him, and concurrence in the opinion of
his fitness for the ministerial office. And after
wards, year by year, his gifts and acceptableness to
the people come under review. The conference
also makes every practicable effort to meet the
wishes of the people in the appointment of minis
ters to the respective circuits. Thus these differ
ent modes ot carrying out the same principle may
and do exist, according to the circumstances of
different churches.”
RELIGIOUS PERIODICALS IN THE M. E.
CHURCH.
The Western Christian Advocate of the 8th inst
has a long and interesting article on this subject.
From the statistical information within his reach,
Dr. Elliott concludes that the whole number of
weekly sheets issued in our Church amounts to
about 50,000, that is about one to every twenty
members. Allowing however, that five in twenty
read the papers, it will still leave three-fourths of
our membership unacquainted with the information
which it is the special business of the weekly press
to disseminate. This is a state of things demand
ing serious consideration. Indeed, there seems to
be rather a declension, than an increase in the cir
culation of the papers of the Church ; at all events
a vast disproportion is manifest between the rapid
increase of Church members, and the means of in
structing them as far as the press is concerned.
The remedy for this must be looked for in the in
creased interest felt in the subject, and the renewed
exertions made by the preachers in their several
fields of operation, for enlarging the circulation of
our periodical press. Information should be given,
publicly and privately, at all the appointments, on
the subject. Diligent search should be made in
view of obtaining subscribers; and remittances
should be promptly sent on to the Publishing Com
mittees.
Ur. Elliott, who has had ample experience on the
subject, and whose opinions are entitled to great
respect, unhesitatingly declares that to fill a large
sheet weekly, with new matter, and in the manner
in which it ought to be done, requires turn good edi
tors, ready at the pen. He adds this cannot be done
with the number of papers, in the Church. Two
or three papers he thinks, would answer every good
purpose which the nine, at present published, ac
complish, especially if two good editors were placed
at the head of each. By division of strength the
energy of the press is not one-fourth of what it
might be.
The Pittsburgh Advocate throws out a sugges
tion to the following effect:—let there be three
general papers, an Eastern, Western, and Southern;
of similar size and of considerably enlarged quarto
form, with sub-editors for every large city within
the range of their several circulations, each to sup
ply such matter as would be interesting in his
immediate vicinity. The proper combination of
central power and diffused interest would thus be
gained, and at a less expense than at present. A
much larger amount of talent would thus be laid
under successful contribution; a more general in
terest felt in the press of the Church; and a ten
fold greater revenue be secured. The whole sub
ject is highly important, and will secure, we hope,
the attention of a large and competent Committee
at the approaching General Conference. We will
only add in reference to the Southern Christian
Advocate, that its subscription list is slowiy but
steadily increasing, eighty new subscribers*having
been put on our mail-books in July, and more than
half that number in August.
‘ ■ —-- '/■; *'
THE EPISCOPAL OFFICE IN THE M. E. .
CHURCH.
It seems to be the policy at present prevailing
in the church, to work the Bishops to death. We,
recollect that Bishop Andrew, at the close of his
last tour, looked as though he could not possibly
hoid up much longer. Indeed, he was unable to
preside all the time, at the last two Conferences he
attended. The Northern Advocate tells us that
the health of Bishop Waugh is so exceedingly bad,
that he had to send to Bishop Hedding for assis
tance in presiding at the Genesee Conference.—
His health is said to be a mere wreck. We can con
ceive of nothing more rapidly exhausting to the
vital energies of body and mind, than the duties of
the 8tationing-room. And where for six months to
gether, this load of responsibility and care has to be
borne by the same officer in a succession of large
Conferences, the result must be speedily disastrous.
Now why should the church thus kill off her lead
ing functionaries 1 Why keep the number of Bish
ops so small as to overtask, and thus prematurely
destroy the incumbents of an office so vitally im
portant in her system of itinerant operations!
There is no solid reason for it. Sectional jealous
ies and difficulties apart, no man can tell why.
We have reason to know, that the right of the
Southern and South-Western Conferences to a rep
resentation in the Episcopal College will be most
unwaveringly asserted at the next General Confer
ence. We have some half-dozen ministers at the
least, whose qualifications every way, would enable
them to grace any episcopate on earth. The unan
imous wish of people and preachers, is that some of
these, at least, should be placed in the position
where their abilities will enable them to meet the
necessities of the Southern Church most fully.
But will this reasonable wish be heeded! We
are sorry to say, we see nought but the remotest
possibility of the thing, if even that Is not this a
hard case 1 Must we not feel it with pecnliar and
withering force, now particularly, when the Christ
ian Advocate has run up the anti-slavery flag to the
peak! We are sorry that their connection with
Southern Conferences will involve our Northern
friends in serious difficulties, let the case be decided
in whatever way. We have no wish to add to the
embarrassment of their position, much less to bring
out any additional threats from any quarter, of aban
doning the church, and seeking "purer commun
ions.” But with us, it is matter of life and death.
Does the “ Golden Rule” require us to love our
neighbour more than ourselves !
THE TRANSYLVANIA UNIVERSITY.
We tender our thanks to Dr. Bascom for the |
copy now before us, of the “Annual Announce
ment of Transylvania University, with Documents
relating to the transfer of the Control of the Insti
tution to the Methodist Episcopal Church. 1843.”
From this publication, we learn that the Commis
sioners appointed by the last General Conference,
to make arrangements with the Trustees of the
University for a transfer of the literary division of
the Institution to the control of the M. E. Church,
have formed a successful negociation with the
Trustees, by which the object proposed to the Con
ference has been fully secured.
The Faculty of Arts is composed of the follow
ing gentlemen:
Rev. H. B. Bascom, D. D., Acting President, and
Professor of Intellectual and Moral Philosophy.
Rev. R. T. P. Allen, A. M., Professor of Mathe
matics, Natural Philosophy and Civil Engineering.
Rev. B. H. M’Cown, A. M., Professor of Ancient
Languages and Literature.
Rev. W. H. Anderson, A M., Professor of Eng
lish Literature.
Rev. J. L. Kemp, A. M., Adjunct Professor of
Mathematics,—Preparatory Department
Rev. Thomas H. Lynch, A. M., Adjunct Profes
sor of Languages,—Preparatory Department
Rev. Wright Merrick, Principal of Junior Sec
tion,—Preparatory Department
The number of students matriculated, and in the
Preparatory Department, amounts to 217.
The Institution has thus risen up from its former
prostration, and entered upon a course of public
prosperity and usefulness prophetic of the largest
and most enduring good to the country.
THE WORK OP GOD IN THE WADESBORO
CIRCUIT.
The brief but deeply interesting communication
of brother Durant, published in another column,
will be read with emotions of gratitude to God
for the gracious displays of his power, accom
panying the preaching of his word of truth, in that
part of the Conference district An accession of
upwards of nine hundred and fifty souls to the mem
bership of the church on a single circuit in less than
nine months, is indeed matter of marvel and thanks
giving. Well may our brethren in that work
adopt the devout language of St. Paul: “ Now
thanks be to God who causeth us always to triumph
in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his
knowledge by us in every place.” We have had
the great pleasure to learn that of the multitudes
converted and admitted into the communion of the
church under the ministry of brother Durant and
his colleague last year in Cypress Circuit, the
gre.ater part remain firm and consistent professors
of religion to the present These “ seals of one’s
apostleship” are the best sort of credentials a minis
ter can show for the truth of his call to the holy
office, and the validity of his commission as a suc
cessor of the apostles.
Brother Durant will please accept our thanks for
the new subscribers he continues to send us.
RECENT PUBLICATIONS.
Presbytery and not Prelacy, the Scriptural and
Primitive Polity, proved from the testimonies of
Scripture, the Fathers, the Schoolmen, the Refor
mers, and the English and Oriental Churches, dpc.
By Th&xas Smyth, Author of Lectures on the
Apostolical Succession, <Pc. Boston, Crocker ae
Brewster. 1843.
This elaborate treatise, from the pen of our ac
complished fellow-townsman, the Rev, Mr. Smyth,
is dedicated to the Presbyterian, Congregational,
Reformed Dutch, German Lutheran, Methodist,
and Baptist denominations, whose common princi
ples of ecclesiastical order, in contrast with those
»f prelacy and papacy, it is mainly designed to ad
vocate. The work is divided into three books; the
first, showing that presbytery is the scriptural and
apostolical order of the Church of Christ: the sec
ond, exhibiting the claims of presbytery to the true
apostolical or ministerial succession, by an appeal to
the fathers, the schoolmen, the reformers, and to
the Romish, Anglican, and other churches; the
third, presenting the antiquity of presbytery, with a
detailed historic account of the ancient Culdees of
Ireland and Scotland. The whole forms a contri
bution to sacred letters, for which the country in
general, the South in particular, is laid under spe
cial obligations to the author. The subject dis
cussed, important at any time, is vitally so at the
present day. Upon it hinges a ton years’ contro
versy, in which an unprecedented amount of learn
ing and vigour has been expended; and around
which, all that is vital in Christianity, and hopeful
for the redeemed race of mankind, is gathered.—
The practical shape now assumed by the question
in debate, is whether the Christian religion is a
thing of forms and ceremonies and church princi
ples; or a spiritual power working by the Holy
Ghost, through the truth of God’s word, upon the
soul. Is it a revived Judaism, tithing its mint,
anise and cummin of outward ceremonies;—or is it
the peace, righteousness and joy in the Holy Ghost,
which is produced by simple faith in Jesus Christ,
without the intervention of priestly negociation or
thauraaturgic ceremonies? Mr. Smyth boldly and
successfully controverts the position that the epis
copate is an original and essentially distinct order
of the Christian ministry, instituted by divine right,
and essentia] to the valid constitution of the Chris
tian Church. He allows distinctly the episcopal
office, involving superintendence and oversight, and
an officer called mMo; raised to that office in the
order of presbyters,—a primut inter pares,—the
precise theory and practice of the Methodist G.
Church; and consequently rejects “prelacy, not
episcopacy,—modern and not primitive, diocesan and
not scriptural episcopacy.” Although we may not
go the whole way with the author, in the minuter
details of his subject, we agree with him in the
leading principles he advocates, and thank him for
the noble vindication which this publication, in con
nection with his work on Apostolical Succession,
asserts against tho growing intolerance of the times.

statement of the introduction of Christianity into

civilization, and is very happily treated by the
author.

The amount of capital invested in the United
States in so apparently inconsiderable a branch
of domestic industry as poultry, will surprize many
who have never examined the subject. The re
turns made by the census of 1840, exhibit the value
of all the poultry in the various states of the Union
at a total of 912,176,170. A well written, practi
cal treatise on the subject, and such is the one |
before us, is highly important We take great
pleasure in recommending this to our friends who
are in circumstances to turn their attention to the
subject It is a small, cheap volume, which will
amply repay the cost of purchase.

representations against a communion who are qui
etly minding their own business. Are we to re
gard the unprovoked attack of last week, as en
dorsed by him? Does bethink a controversy be
tween the denominations called for at this time 1—
Does our honoured brother mean that the Baptist
Advocate shall commend and bring into wider no
tice such publications as Mr. Annan’s t Are there
no difficulties elsewhere than in Methodism, that
need the judgment of candour, the heart of charity
which thinketh no evil 1 Is it his wish that strife
should be stirred up 1 We hope not; for the cause
of the common Christianity at least. But if we are
mistaken in this, we shall not flinch from defend

seek no controversy with the Baptist Advocate, but
we shall certainly not shun a conflict forced upon

which he would likely wish to respond, and so the
matter might grow into a personal dispute. For

tried for a year or two the varieties' of metalic sub*
stitutes for tbe goose-quill, to be found in the hands
of the stationers, we have come to the conclusion
that the pens manufactured by Wright and Co. are
the thing. We recommend them heartily. Their
flexibility, smoothness and finish, compare very
advantageously with the pens heretofore in market.

Tractahianism taught at the Public Ex
pense.—It is stated that the Rev. M. P. Parks,
Chaplain of the Military Academy at West Point,
who is supported by the Government of the United
States, advocates, in his public discourses, the Ro
mish errors revived by the Oxford Tractarians.
The redress of the evil can hardly be anticipated,
as those who appoint to this office do not examine
candidates in theology, and perhaps feel little inter
est in the matter. * ~ '
■ State of the Cotton Market. — For the ben
efit specially of our country patrons, we have pro
cured the aid of an accomplished mercantile friend,
who is perfectly acquainted with the state of the
market in this city, and who will furnish during the
season, a weekly report, made up at the time of ouf
going to press, and to be depended on.
Insanity.—’While the remedial treatment of this
terrible disease is constantly improving, it seems
that the disease itself is rapidly extending. The
average number of the insane in England and the
United States is about one in one thousand of the
population. There is now in the United States an
army of maniacs more than 17,000 strong,_an ap
palling thought. Intemperance and licentiousness
(the latter especially in its covert forms) are the
principal causes. The way of the transgressor is
hard.—Zions Herald.
Increase of Freewill Baptists.—We learn
from the Morning Star that the increase of this de
nomination the past year has been greater than
that of any previous year since Randall first com
menced proclaiming the gospel in 1777, viz. 3 year
ly meetings, 8 quarterly meetings, 108 churches,
57 ordained preachers, 66 licentiates and 10,684
communicants. They have now 22 yearly meetings,
1165 churches, 771 ordained ministers, 250 licen
tiates and 61,372 communicants.
The Inquisition—The Catholic Herald of
Philadelphia, in reference to the statement by Col.
Lehmanoueky, now a minister of the gospel, who
commanded the detachment of the French army
that destroyed the Inquisition in Spain, justifies this
infernal tribunal, and thinks “ the instruments of
torture were exhibited to the culprit to produce
terror” only. That’s good. Only defend the In
quisition, and its terrible atrocities, and Romish
priests will soon find their “occupation gone.”
The New Methodist Church, known as the
“Pew Church,” corner of Fayette and Charles
street, Baltimore, the first stone of which was laid in
April, is progressing rapidly. The walls are ail up
and the roofing completed. The structure, with
the handsome portico in front, will be quite an addi
tion to that city. The building committee expect
to have it completed in time for the next session of
the Baltimore Annual Conference.
Mar Yohannan.—The missionaries who sailed
for Oroomiah, with whom Bishop Mar Yohannan
returned, arrived at that place on the 14th of June
last, in good health. They were heartily welcomed
by the Nestorians, and escorted into the city by a
large procession, and with considerable ceremony.
The good Bishop was delighted to get home,—wiser
if not better for his visit.
Unity.—“An aged Churchman,” writing for the
London Record, in speaking of the Established
Church, says: “I now find what was once the
Church, divided into distinctive churches, differing
in modes of worship, and, what is more awful, differ
ing in essentials! split into two hostile parties in a
fearful state of preparation, for.I
dare not fill up the line.”
The Rev. Mr. Barnes.—The Christian Obser
ver states that the Rev. Mr. Barnes has declined the
office of President of the Auburn Theological Sem
inary, thinking that his present position as pastor of
a large church in Philadelphia is more favourable
for promoting the interests of religion.
Rohan Catholics.—It is said that in Ireland,
the proportion of Roman Catholics to Protestants,
in the whole population, is understood to be as six
or seven to one, whilst the real property owned by
Protestants is to that owned by Roman Catholics
nearly as five to one.—Presbyterian.
Archbishop Whately’s Book.—A cheap edi
tion of the masterly and unanswerable work of
Whately, entitled “ The Kingdom of Christ delin
eated” has been published by Campbell & Co.
CIRCULAR.
To the Presidents and Managers of the several Bible
Societies in South Carolina.
Gentlemen :—The Executive Committee of the
Bible Convention, addressed a Circular under date
of 1st May last, to the several Bible Societies of our
State, referring to the journals of the Convention of
December last, (packages of which were sent to
each Society,) and requesting their adoption or
prosecution of the measures recommended in the
Resolutions of that body.
The year being now far advanced, the Committee
beg leave to remind the several Societies, that the
day fixed by the sixth resolution, for the next.
Meeting of the Bible Convention, is Tuesday the
28th day of November next, and in reference to that
meeting, respectfully ask their attention to the
following matters, viz:
1st. That in order to enable the Executive Com
mittee to submit a Report of the operations of the
year, each Society will favour the Chairman, in
conformity with the 7th resolution, with a few lines,
giving their proceedings and distributions, during
that period. And the Committee will be gratified,
if these communications should be received before,
or by the 1st day of November.
2d. That each Society appoint Delegates to at
tend the Convention to be held at the time above
stated, at Columbia, and
Sd. That the Societies which have not contri
buted, during the present year to the expenses in
curred by the Executive Committee, will do so as
early as practicable. The idea having been relin
quished of sending an Agent to travel through the
Btate, in promotion of the general object, the sum
