part a very aisagreeable flivor to both
milk and butter. Every farmer, however,
should have a cellar under or contiguous
to his barn that would contain a sufficient
quantity to feed during the winter, or a
greater portion of it. As the roots are
disposed of, a word in regard to the tops:
they should be gathered and laid (not too
thick) in some cool place ; those from
beets should be fed to milch cows?from
rut a baga to young stock, or cows not in
rsilk, as they give to the butter an un.
pleasant flavor.

own 9eed ; as it not unfrequently happens
that three-fourths of the seed will not
vegetate?a serious loss and disappointment
after being at the expense and trouble
of preparing the land. The cause of
this failure is generally attributed to old
seed. I was also under this impression
until I attempted to raise my own seed,
when I discovered the true cause. The
aeed plants throw out a number of long
and tender stems or stalks, which soon
becomeheavily loaded with seed, and unless
supported in some wav, the most
valuable stalks are broken off by the first
storm of rain or wind they encounter.
The seed from these stalks are all gather,
ed by the seedsman and sold with the
good seed, as they scarcely differ in external
appearance from those that have
been perfected. Where the plants are
set in rows, a few sticks with forked end9.
set in the ground, on each side the row,
with poles laid in the fork at a proper
height, furnish a cheap and sufficient support.
Single roots may be supported by
two or more small cords tied around the
stems at different heights. Of good seed,
one pound of rutabaga- and two ponnds
of be it are amply f sufficient for one acre.
My experience in the cultivation of the
carrot has been very limiied. Finding
them to require so much more hand labor
than the beet or turnip with greater expense
in gathering, while they were far
inferior in point of productiveness, I was
under the impression that their superiority
as food for stock was much more than
counterbalanced by the increased quantitv
per acre of the other roots at less expense,
and therefore abandoned their culti
vat ion.
FEEIIING, dec.
I have made some experiments in steaming
roots for my stock, but did not, consider
the advantages derived from this
process sufficient to pay for the extra laborand
expense. My apparatus being
small (having been erected for preparing
food for a small number of swine,) and
not convenient to mv-barn, I found it attended
with much labor?and as this cannot
be done under the eve of the farmer,
who, like myself superintends and aids in
executing- the other labors of 4he farm
much time is generally wasted by the
hand employed in preparing the food and
distributing it among the stock. The
plan of feeding which I have adopted is
as follows: Near the cellar which con- i
tains the roots is placed an oblong-box,
made of plank, say three feet by six, into
which the roots are thrown; a common
garden spade ground sharp is used to cut
them; baskets with a hoop handle that
will each hold a feed for one animal are
provided ; with these, the prepared roots
are carried by a boy into the alley in
front of the stalks in which the animals
are confined, and deposited in a tight
manger, (the first stall in the range being
only twenty feet from the cellar.) In
this way two boys, one to cut and the
other to carry the roots, will feed a large
stock in a very short time, and under the
eve of the master while he is employed in
attending to the other stock about the
stables and yard. A small quantity of
.salt is given with the roots once a day.
I have for some time entertained the
-opinion that the best plan of feeding
roots is to grate them fine and mix them
with cut hay or straw ; and this opinion
fcas been confirmed by an experiment
made during the past winter : Pounding
the beets to a jelly and mixing with them
an equal quantity of cutstraw moistened
-with water, the whole mess was eaten
greedily, and in two weeks the animal
had evidently improved in appearance?
eating the same quantity of roots she had
before, ft is very certain, the more
coarse provender cattle can be induced to
eat with their richer ormore nourishing
food, the better will he their condition.
?Thus,in wintering store cattle, after
they have had their teed of stalks or hay
in the morning,a rack infilled with straw
to which they have access through the
d ty, by winch (experience has proved)
tney are much benefitted. I contemplate
procuring for use next winter a grate
mil!, (similar to those used for apples) to
attach to the horse power connected with
my threshing machine, by which a sutTicient
quantity for a large stock may be
prepared in a short t.me as they will grate
apples at the rate of sixty bushels per
hour: expense exclusive of horse power
from $15 to 20. Swine eat the sugar
beet greedily?they eat them in preference
to the turnip ; but when the heet is
fed in any quantity they should he cooked,
as they invariably produce scouring or
loudness of the bowels when fed in a raw
State ; when cooked and fed with a small
quantity of bran, hogs thrive and fatten
rapidly upon them.?Horses also prefer
the beet to the turnip, and when worked
hard and grained* one feed of beets per
day is of great service, as thev are cool,
ing and opening to the system, and keep
the animal in a healthy and vigorous condition.
Although for horses I prefer the
/fner varieties of potatoes to any other
root, the comparative cheapness of the
.beet uowever must induce us to give them
.the preference on the score of economy.
There exists much difference of opinion
in rvgaxd to ihexelative value ofth$ diff.

rerent roots, and I have long been anxious ;
! to make seme experiments that would
settle this matter satisfactorily; as most
: of the opinions that I have seen or heard,
either verbal or written, have been mere
guess work. With this view of last fall
procured in New York a lactomoter (a
glass instrument ten inches long and'
three-fourths of an inch in diameter,
worked off into tenths and hundredths)
for the purpose of testing the richness pf
milk.?With this instrument I have tried
the milk of all my cows, and to my great
surprise find they give from nine up to
twenty.five per cent, of cream?varying
sixteen per cent. Only one gives twentyfive
per cent., and she,one of the best
milkers in the yard, in three successive
trials made with her milk, gave the same
result?ao other cow giving over sixteen
per cent.
On the first of January last I commenced
measuring the milk of a cow from
which the calf had been sold one week
previous; she had been fed on turnip-fruta
bagafrom before calving up-till this, time,
for four weeks previous, one bushel per
day.?Her milk was carefully measured
for six successive days, average, trr
1 quarts one gill per day; lactometer
filled three times during the week,, gave'
each time fifteen per cent, cream. Feed
changed to sugar bee;?one bushel p?r
day for one week;, cumtnencom5nt of
second week, measured?continued for
six days (same feed)?average quantity
j per day, eight quarts and half pint; lact'ometer
field three times, each time, givling
eleven and a half per ct. of cream.
| This experiment thus far was decidedly
! in favor of the ruta baga, and the ap.
Tpearance of the animal at the close of the
| beet feeding was not as good as while fed
i on the'turnip. . l again changed the feed
to turnip, intending to feed one week,
and again measure, hut a severe and protr^f**^
illness in my family prevented
any farther experiments at this time.
On the 19th of March, I commenced
; measuring the milk of another cow from
wnich the calf had been taken a few
days previous. Her feed for some t'me
had been one bushels of beets per day,
and continued for one week, during
which the milk was measured?average

gave nine per cent, of cream. Changed
to sugar beet?one bushel per day
for one week ; second week commenced
measuring?continued six day??average
per day nine quarts one half pint?milk
giving ten per cent cream. In this experiment
there is a gradual falling off in
quantity in each of the changes of feed
and an incerase of richness on resuming
the beet feed. The apparent inferiority
of the turnips in this case, I attribute to
their having been severely frozen in the
fall, as a part of my turnips were frozen
in the ground, but the ground thawing in
a few days they were taken up and buried.
Although these experiments are very
far from being conclusive, lam rather in.
clined to give the preference to the turnip.
I intend, however, to continue them
until I am entirely satisfied?intending
also to try the different grains (ground)?
feeding in the proportion of the average
produce of each per acre. I shall also
procure a thermometer to be used in future.
I find these experiments cannot be
rnndiirted with nerfect accuracy without
one, as the quantity of cream depends
very much upon the temperature. I
filled the lactometer in the winter and hung
it in a situation where I should suppose it
must have heen near the freezing point,
and in five hours a perfect separation had j
taken place?all the cream heing upon
the surface (none rising after)?the instrument
being as before stated ten inches
I in length. It was filled again with milk
| from the cow, and hung in the dwelling
! room over a stove where the temperature
I was about summer heat, and in fifteen
hours no separation had taken place?not
a particle of cream appearing upon the
surface. This will suggest to those hav.
ing the management of dairies, the great
advantage of setting their nans for a few
hours in cold water. I am w?:!l satisfied ;
out r\f (n?i tim uitlu IP I

summer does not yield half its crenm. I
The lactometer and a common t'inib! " I
three inches deep and three in d?n?n ' r I
at top, were filled with milk from tee
same cow, at one time, and placed in a
situaiton where thev had the same temperature
; the cream all rose to the surface
in one as in the other.?This explodes the
old and firmly established opinion of the
necessity of shallow pans. I have been
both gratified and instructed bv these experimenfs,
and hope others may be induced
to try them, as it is from numerous experiments
only that we can arrive at a
correct conclusion. I have no doubt luit
that the quantity of butter made, from
the milk in our country, during the sum
mer season, under proper management,
may be more than doubled. This is certainly
a very Important matter both to the

Report of tiie Secretary of the i
Treasury.^
[According to this report, the receipts
into tne ireasury, in mw, muau..^
Treasury notes, were $26,850,820 44;
and the expenditures, $27,863,475 41,
leaving a balance of $987,345 03. The
report states that there will he required
for the services of the present year $28,t
731,336 96; whilst the actual and estimated
means under existing laws, to
meet.these demands, amount to -only!
$20,730,395 84; leaving a'deficiency of
$8,000,G41 14, to be provfded for. After
an extended statement from which this'
is. an abstract, the Secretary proceeds aft
follows.] ~ ~
Thus and to this extent, with in the
last four years, were the expenditures
pushed beyond the amount of the revenue
They were made to absorb the snrples in
the Treasury and the outstanding debts
due to the United States, so thai the
Treasury was, on the 4th or march,. 1841'
exhausted of its means and subject to
heavy and immediate liabilities It was
already burdened with a debt incurred
in time of peace, and without any.' adb*
quate resources . except the authority
granted by law to augment the debt. *
As yet no provission has.been made to
ducedthis debt or to checkits constant and
rapid increase. We . find it, therefore, as
far as past legeslation and financial at*,
rangements characterized it a permanent
and increasing national debt. The tetnporary
expedients by whi^h it nas bc^O
sustained no not at an vary Jis esscim?!
character. * r*
The attention of Congress is respectfully
invited to the necessity of e*ito%nd
effectual measures to prevent it? ftirther
augmentation. The obyiotrti " remedy is
?o increase the revnue as far as may be
without unreasonably burdening commerce,
and to reduce the expenditures
within the limits of strict economy.'
But as it may not comport with the views
oPCongress to go into a revisions nd adjustment
of the customs so long before the act
of March 2, 1833, comes to have its final
and permanent operation, the undersigned
would respectfully recommend as a temporary
measure, the levy of a duty of 20
per cent. Ad valorem on all articles
which are now free of duty, or which pay
a less duty than 20 prtr cent, except gold
arid silver, and the articles specificallye/i.
umerated in ihe fith section of the act of
March 2d, 1833. . ; :
If this measure he adopted, it* is estimated
that there will be receiv&d iota the
Treasury from customs in the last quarter
of the present year, shout $5,300.(100; in
all of the year 1842, about $22i500,000;
and in the year 1843, after the final deduction
under the act of March 2, 1833,*
about .$20,800,000, The details of this
estimate will he found in "the accompanying
paper, marked E and enclosures. **
It is believe that* after the heavy expenditures
required for the public service |
in the present year shall have been provided
for, the revenues which will accrue
from that, or a nearly proximate rate of
duty will be sufficient to defray,yie expenses
of Government, a id leave a surplus
to be anually applied to the gradual payment
of the national debt, leaving'.the
proceeds of the public lands to be disposed
of as Congress.shiall thi/ik fit. .. ' 1
The general principals on which tVe final
revision of the tariff, is to res!, aj-e
perhaps simple and easy to be apprhenjled,'
but the work of revission itself, in ifs'.&ddaptionand
detail, must be a work" of
time. It should be done on cairn reflection
and careful deliberation, wfth'a view'
to reconcile, as f^r as possible, th'e'confiic
ting opinion* and to promote ail the various
interests of the whole People of these United
States. And it may be important, in
that adjusment, not only to reciprocate
on fair and equal principles, and in a liberal
spirit, the concession which may be
accorded to our own commerce by foreign
nations, but also to do justice to our own
citizens by meeting in a like equaf spirit
any heavy exactions or prohibitions which
foreign nations may think fit to impose
upon the iir portation of our staple productions.
Some legal provissions are ilso required
to correct inequalities between the duties
upon sugar and molasses and the draw,
backs upon refined sugarand rum, manufactured
or distilled from foreign materi.
als. The relation between the duty and
the drawback was adjusted by th.e acts
of January 21st, 1829, and May 19,1830
since which time the duties have been deminished.
while the drawback remain the
same. And a provision of law declaring
that non.enumerated articles which bear
a similitude to any enumerated articles
chargeable with duty shall pay the ?ame
rate of duty with the articles which it
most resembles, would save a large sum
annually to the revenue, and to prevent
m.M-h annoyance and litigation between
the importer and the officers charged with
die collection of the customs.
Of.the. Public Debt.
But it is not expected that any tnodifi-ntfoo
of the revenue laws will be opera.tve
:o supply the immedia te wantsof thc
Treasury, and to pay the dsbt which fall
due in the present and in the ensneing
year. A further loan is necessary to
effect these objects, and the only question
that can arise are as to the mode of procuring
the loan, the character of thesecu
rities, and the assumed duration of the
debt.
It would, in the opinion of the undersigned,
be unwise to charge upon the
commerce or the resources of the country,
in any form, the burden of paying at
once, or at all hastily, the national debt.
Before that is done, measures of restoratton
and relief are restored, and commerce
and industry relieved from, their
present state of embarrassment*and depressioo,
and a benign and liberal policy
on the part of the General Government
should call forth once more the hardy industry
and active enterprise of our people
r it
and the vast resources of our country.'
If we assume the period of from five to
eight years as that in wfoich this debt cam
he paid without incomes ience and em*
barrassment-i-and the time appears to be
short enough?^-we have one of the most
essential elements on whr-cb to-form our,

delusive, hpve yet their advantages.?
They need not bo issued f: ste"'than the
actual wants of the treasury re uire, and
the power to issue any giv?. n sum is, for
effective purposes of immediot ; expenditures,
a fund in the treasury available to
that -amount. But, when the debt has acquired
its maximum and ceases to accumulate,
or when it becomra larger than
the amount necestary to keep on hand to
meet the current wants of the Treasury
these advantages disappear. This mode
of loan then becomes to the Government
what the sale in market of rew promissory
notes for the purpose of raising money to
take up old prenrssory notes, is to an in'dividual.
It is the isrtie of Treasury
hotsrio lake up other Treasury notes
year after year in sucesssion ; and, under
those circumstances, it is inconvenient
and expensive.. - C .

being involved with the payment of
the old ; while the people, and even those
who administer the finances, may not be
impressed with the important fact that a
national debt is created or in the process
of creation. "*
Therefore, in the opinion of the unde".
signed, when a national debt does exist,
and must continue for a time, it is better
that it should be made a funded debt, according
to our ancient financial usage.
It is then sheltered bv no cover, and is j
the subject of no deldsion It is open, i
palpable, true; the eyes of the country
will be upon it, and will be able at a glance
to mark its reduction or its increase ; and
it is believed that a loan for the requisite
aftiourtt, having eight years to run, but
redeemable at the will of the Government,
on six months' notice, could be negotiated
at a much less rate of interest than Treasury
notes." Much expense would also
be saved in dispensing with the machinery
of the issue and payment and cancelling
of Treasury notes.
It is therefore respectfullyrecommended
that a sum sufficient to pay the debt at
present existing, and such as will necessarily
accrue in this and the ensuing year,
be raised on loan for the time, and on the
condition above suggested.
On Keeping and disbursing the public
moneys.
The undersigned would also respectfully
invite the attention of Congress to the
present mode of keeping and disbursing
the public moneys; and also to the sub
ject of the creation or employment of a
fiscal agent to be changed with the perfoupahce
of these and other duties. The
subject is one of great'importance, both to
,tjie Croverhment and to the community.
. Such agent or depository ought to unite,
in the highest practicable degree, the
safety of the public funds, and convenience
and economy in their administration
; and it should, if possible, he so selected
or framed as to exert a salutary influence
over the business and currency of
the country.
The mode of keeping and disbursing
the public mohev, provided by the act of
July 4,1840, will be found, on comparison
with that heretofore chiefly used by
the Government, eminently deficient in,
all these essential requisites. ' The financial
history of the United States, es.
pecially for the last twelve years, furnishes
abundant proof that the public money
is unsafe in the custody of individuals,
r*. l i" fr
ana tnai cneir omciai oonns are no sumcient
security for its safe-keeping and
faithful application. Within the period
above named many receiving officers connected
with the Treasury Department
have become defaulters to the Government.
The aggregate loss from that
cause within that period, as shown by the
books of the Department, amounts to $2520.500,
but a small part of which will
probably be recovered from their bonds.
It is true that, in any system which can
be adopted, some part of the public money
must, in the process of collection, pass
through the hands of individuals, and be
subject to tfieir defalcations; but the act
of July 4,1840, extends and continues the
risk beyond the period of collection, and
it subjects large masses, which in the
fluctuations of commerce, sometimes ac.
cumulate, to the same dangerous custody.
. Not only is the public money in the
hands of individual more exposed to loss
from ordinary defalcations than when de.
posited in a well-regulated bank ; but the
Government is also liable to the risks of
tire, robbery, and other casualities, occur,
ring either in deposite or transmission,
from which it is entirely protected when
a well-regulated bank is the depository
and the fiscal agent.
The present system is also, in many
respects, cumbrous and inconvenient.
Its tendency is to cenire the disbursements
of the public money at some of the Eastern
cities, chiefly at New York. That
being the great commercial emporium of
the United States, is the point at which
funds are the most valuable, and there
fo/e, the most sought; hence those who
are entitled to payments out of the public
Treasury claim then there. It is true
there is a general discretion in the head of
~ ' - \ .,i
the Iiepnrimeni 10 reiuse or gram mc iavor
of such payments accorr': ng to its convenience
; but when the currency is de.
ranged, and the premium on exchanges is
high, this discretion involves discrimination
to a large amount as to creditors equally
entitled. It then becomes a dangerous
discretion, and one that ought jiot to exits.
But, under the present system, it
cannot be avoided, save in a few cases,
without discharging every puhlic liability
at the roost favored point.. This would at
once centre nil the disbursements eta few
of the Eastern cities, and involve the n
T reasury in the rink and expense of trans- t<
\orting the public funds from the various a
points of collection to the places of die- y
bursem^nt* a
An item of less importance, but still e
worthy of consideration, in settling on a
permanent and economical arrangement,
is the direct expense of the present ays- 8
tern, inclu ling the cost of the buildinga *
for the deposite of the public money, and *
the salaries of the officers and their clerks
who receive and disburse it. No portion F
of this risk, inconvenience, or expense
need to be incurred where a well-regulated
bank is made the fiscal ageut.
But the present system is also, in the
opinion ofthe undersigned, injurious to
the business and currency of the country.
Instead of permitting the credit and the
finances of the Government to lend their
| indirect but efficient aid in sustaining the
| credit and regulating the currency of the
! country, it brings into direct hostility
* ' " I
those important interests. In the progress
of the system a sufficient amount of
gold and silver to supply the wants of the
Treasury must be withdrawn from circulation
and locked up in vaults, leaving no
representative to supply its place in the
j general circulation.
A large amount, also, in the hands of
I those who pay to or receive from the Treasury,
is equally withdrawn from general
circulation, and made to flow through
those channels alone which lead into and
out of the public coffers. The other avenues
of commerce and intercourse are
thus deprived of their proportion of the
precious metals.
Within the fifty-two years during
which our constitutional Government has
existed, we hare had, for two periods of
twenty years each, a bank chartered by
Congress as a depository of the public
moneys and as a fiscal agent. We have
had, also, at two intervals, amounting to
about nfoe years, State banks employed
for like purposes ; and, during the remainder
of the time, the funds of the Governrnent
have been kept and the finances administered
partly by banks and partly by
individual officers and agents. The losses
sustained by State banks, as depositories,
during the first period of their employment,
extending from 1811 to 1818,
agreeably to a statement prepared by the
Secretary of the Treasury in 163d, and
revised and republished in 1837, were
$l,OfM),076. In the latter period, from
1833 to 1837, though no actual loss is believed
to have occured, yet the Treasury
and the country suffered inconvenience
and embarrassment from the fiscal arrangements
with those numerous and disconnected
instittutions. But, during the
forty years that the two banks of the United
States were the depositories of the
public money and the fiscal agents of the
Government, no loss whatever was sustained,
nor any delay or any expenso in-1
curred in transmitting or disbursing the |
public money, so far as the agency of
those institutions extended. Then, as j
regards the wants of the Treasury merely,
the safety of the public funds, and econo.
my in their administration, experience
has demonstrated the superior utility of a
hank constituted and adopted by Congress
as a fiscal agent. It has also proved to
us that the business of the country, its
currency, its credit, its industry, and its
commerce,are intimately connected with
and dependent upon the financial arrangetnonta
nf thft General Government. If
they be wise and beneficent, they indirect,
ly, hut efficiently* promote those great
interests of the People; if constant and !
uniform in their action, they give to those
interests confidence and stability.
Since the removal of the public depos.'
ites from the Rank of the United States, \
in 1833, the Government has had no per. j
manent fiscal agent and no definite fin- j
ancial system. All has been experiment,
transfer, and change. The business of |
the country has yielded to the unsteady j
impulse, and moved forward with wild j
irregularity ; at one time stimula ed to J
excessive action, at another sunk into j
lethargy. And, in providing for the
wants of the Treasury, it is surely im.
portant to look, also, to the want* and the
welfare of the community, from the products
of whose industry the Treasury is
supplied.
And as regards those great interests,
we find the testimony of past years is no
* . /V /
less distinct and strong in lavor oi n mon.
eyed institution chartered by the General
Government, and possessed of its confidence
and credit. The period embracing
the last ten years of the existence of the
late Bank of the United States as the
fiscal agent is fresh in the memory of us
all, and is looked back to as a period of
great public prosperity; and though
other causes did, doubtless, co-operate to
produce that favorable condition of things
yet one of the governing principles on
which depended the steady advance of
thedountry in commerce, in industry,!
and in industry, and in substantial wealth
was the existence of a fiscal agent estab.
lished by the General Government, and
charged with the equalization of exchanges,
and the regulation of the currency.
In the present condition of our country
the relief to be anticipated from such an
* - . i? :, K..+
institution CilfJ lJUl lie uuuicu ia ic, uui
must be the work of time. The business
of the country would, however, in the
opinion of the undersigned, steadily and
certainly revive under its influence.
In whatever point of light the undersigned
is able to view this subject, he is
irresistibly led to the conclusion that such
a fiscal agent, so framed as to possess
those important functions, is alike essential
to the wants of the Treasury and of
the community. Such ' an ' institution
should be framed with deliberation, for it
j'.- 1 ^rnrnssmmmm
iust hare high duties to perform, and ex* '
snsive interests to protect and promote f 1M
nd it should be granted with care, for it
rill be liable to great and dangerous
buses* As the fiscal agent of the Govrnmentf
and an effective regulator of the
urrency in a wide-spread community, it
hould be steady and uniform in its aC*
ion, and fixed and stable in its characer.
The undersigned has no douht of the , rower
of Congress to create such an initiation,
Experience has proved its
aeceasity to carry cut other expressly
granted powers; it has been exercised
ind recognized by the Legislative and
Executive departments of the Govern*
ment during four-fifths of the whole pSifi*
r>d of our national existence, and it has
received the uniform sanction of surhigh*
est judicial tribunal.
Yet that power has been questioned by
many wise and patriotic statesmen whose
opinions are entitled to consideration and
respect; and in a measure like thixofhigb political
import, which, if wisely conceie* - . ,

If such an Institution ean be so con*
ceived in principle and guarded in its de*
tails as to remove all scruples touching
the question of constitutional power, and
thus avoid the objections which have
been urged against those heretofore crested
by Congress, it will, in the opinion
of the undersigned, produce the happiest
results, and confer lasting and important
benefits on the country.
The undersigned, therefore, respectful- ^
ly recommends the creation of such fiscal
agent, and repeal the act of July 4th,
1840, providing for the collection, safekeeping,
transfer, and disbursement of ,
the public revenue," except the penal
provisions thereof, which Will probably
require revision and modification.
All which is respectfully submitted.

Collusion at ska.
The packet ship Susquehanna, Capf# .
J. VV. Mikrcxen which arrived at Philadelphia
on Sunday last, had a terrible encounter
with another vessel on the 8tb
inst. off the banks of Newfoundland.? '
The night was not dark, but tbe sec wae"
running high, and they did not discover
each other nntill tbe fenrfatl
The Susquehanna's bowspfrit Is tfktfft ' >d3
off clean and cut-water torn and retfcbed i ?''
from the ship in a way which show# the
encounter must have been IrsroeodwUs* w? ***
She was running at the rate of nine knet^n; ^ <c*
and shipping seas constantly at thaijtJMC#,,,,
the impression on board the SuaquqlNMvM f
is, that the blow was so hard ami so pear . "
the centre of the other ship, that they
must have been totaly disabled, if not
stove in, causing her to sink immediately.
After the collision she slewed round
and grated past the Susquehanna with
such rapidity that no oppertuniiy wasgiv* '
en to discover who she was or tbe exteot'
of her injuries. The impression on board
is, that she was an bast Indranrmtn, or
some ship of the largest class, and as the
cut-water of the Susquehanna is taken ^
off low down she was on the top of a sea at
the moment of the collision. Consequent* ..."
Iv the other ship must have suffered the . ...
moreseverlv. No cries were heard, and,
in the confusion of the crash and anxiety
for self-preservation, no distinct know*
ledge of the character of the other shipcould
be learned. The npinoun on board _,
is, that the man at the wheel of the ill-fated
ship must have been killed instantly.
The whole ofthi painful encounter is only
an other evidence of the unavoidable
hazards of navigation. Perhaps the ship .
instantly founderod, and in one "fell
swoop" all on board were ushered into
eternity together.
The Philadephia Xorth american state*
that the Captain of the Susquehanna did
not wear about his ship and look after the
one he had disabled,,because the consternation
was so great for some time on board
his ship that noting was thought of but
self-preservation.
An applicant for office was recently
urging his pretentions upon the President
and enforcing them by disparaging a
competitor, who, he said, had no political
weight, and would bring no political in*
fluence to the administration. *

that he shall exercise any political
influence."
