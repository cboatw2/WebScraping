TO ISABEL.
Rose of Camden! By that form.
Fulgent'midst the raging storm,?
By that face, I then perused,
With empyreal hues suffused,?
By that Battering, trembling pain.
Softly stealing thro' each vein,?
By that tremor of the soul,
When I felt thy swoet control,?
By that cross, i lova 10 see,
Of gams not half as pure as thee,?
By those smiles, which lured me 'till
I loved thee then,?I love thee still!
Rose or Camden! Thou art far,
,f Dimly shines that lucid star
Whioh, from lofty fields of light,?
Witness in that sacred nightCould,
in dusky, glimmering view,'
Register each sigh we drew,
While angels their soft music fiung,
Around the whispers of that tongue:
By th' rich carmine of that check,
By that spirit mild and meek,?
Those eyes, (methinks I see them fill,)?
I loved thee then,?I love tiiek still!
Ross op Camden! Can the past
Aught but death from mein'ry blast,
Can affection, free from care,
Choicest flow'ret, nurtur'd there,?
Envclop'd in oblivion's veil,
Forgotten die, an idle talc?
Secure in heaven's unbroken seal
Lie the soft raptures lovers feel,
Stamp'd on their golden tablets there.
First-love's unsullied sighs appear:
They test my truth, proclaim my will,?
I lored thoe then,?I love thee still!
Rose or Camden! Bid the dove
Cease his wooing mato to love,
Bid the lion in despair
Desert the fond one of his lair,
Bid tho eagle leave tho nest,
Where, with ardent truth caressed,
Dauntless, 'midst the thunder's ire,
Blazed unquench'd his strong desire;
But never think that hearts sincere
Erase remembrances so dear:
Through every joy and every ill,
I loved thee then,?I love thee still!
Rose of Camden! Thou art gone,
Amidst the fair I feel alone;
Other forms perchance surround,
Praise thy charms in every sound,?
They tell thee of those falcon eyes,
They tell thee of that queenly guise,?
They tell thee of that ermine brow,
That virgin flush, that chaster glow;
But can thoy feel as I have felt,
Can they knscl as I have knelt?
They cannot own, with fervid shrill,
I loved thee then,?I love thee still!
Rose op Camden! Evo prevails,
Unheeded sveop its lisping gules,
Night's screneat drapery
Enchants no more, unseen by thee:
By those ringlets, floating light
On that bosom's heaving white.
Snowy covering of a heart
Pure and true, as fair thou art,?
By that last, that plaintivo strain,
By that wish to meet again,?
By that tear, that sigh, that chill,
I loved thoe then,?I love thee still.
WASHINGTON, Feb, 13.
Alexander McLeod and the Steamboat
Caroline.
Mr. Pickens, from tlte Committee on
Foreign Affairs, asked leave to make a report
from that committee in relation to
the correspondence between the United
States and Great Britain in relation to the
destruction of the steamboat Caroline
during the troubles on the Canada frontier
ih the winter of 1837-8; as also in
relation lo me arresi hum iiiiprisMimiGiu ui
Alexander McLeod, a British subject, for
Being concerned in the destruction of the
boat.
No objection being made?
Mr. Pickens sent in the report, as follows
The committee on Foreign Affairs, tn
whom was referred the Message of the
Krasident, transmitting a correspondence
with the British Minister in relation to the
f burning of the steamboat Caroline, anr
the demand made for the liberation o
Mr. Alexander McLeodj respectfully re
ort:
It appears that the steamboat "Caroline"
was seized and destroyed in the
| month of December, 1837. The com
mittee are induced to believe that the
facts of the case are as follows: The boat
was owned by, and in possession of, a
citizen of New York. She was cleared
from the city of Buffalo, and, on the
morning of the 29th of December, 18371,
she left the port of Buffalo, bound for
Schlosser, upon the American side of the
*' ?iU a a
Niagara nver, ana wiinui me icrmury ui
the United States. The original intention
seemed to be to run the boat between
Buffalo and Schlosser, or perhaps from
Rock dam to Schlosser, and, should it
seem profitable, it was intended to run
her also to Navy Island, and touch at
Grand Island and Tonawanda. Her
owner wai Mr. Wells, said to be a respectable
citizen of Buffalo, and it is obvious
his intention in putting up the boat
was one of speculation and profit entireI
ly. The excitement upon that portion of
'the frontier, at this period, had collected a
[great many in the neighborhood, some
from curiosity, some trom idleness, and
others from taking an interest in the unusual
and extraordinary collection of adventurous
men gathe-ed together at that
time on Navy Island. Navy Island was
"nominally" in the British "territory."
The owner of the Caroline took advantage
of circumstances to make some
money with his boat, by running her as a
ferry boat to Navy Island. All these appear
from testimony regularly taken.?
(See H. R. Doc: No. 332, pages 46 and
49, 2d Session, 25th Congress,) and the
committee know of no legal evidence to
contradict them. There is no proof that
any arms or munitions of war were carried
in the boat, except, perhaps, one
small six-pounder field piece belonging to
a passenger. The principal object was to
run the boat as a ferry boat froin Schlosser,
on the American side, to Navy Island,
on the British side. It is believed that,
even in war, a neutral Power has the
right to trade in contraband articles, subject;
of course, to seizure and confiscation
if taken within the jurisdiction of either
r.f tkn nrtnlorirt11inr narlioc Whfll is run.
V" IUV r~.
traband of war is not always certain.?
Treaty stipulations frequently include
some articles, and exclude others recogniz&{Lia4h!$
law of nations. Trading in
conr&baftd articles is no excuse for invading
tpe territory and soil of a neutral
and independent Power, whose private
citizens may choose to run the hazards of
such a trade. In this instance there were
no two foreign Powers engaged in war;
but all concerned in the outbreak or excitement
within the British jurisdiction
claimed to be British subjects, in resistance
of the authorities of Canada, a province
of the British empire. Even admitting,
then, that the Caroline was engaged
in contraband trade, yet it was with
citizens who claimed to be subjects of the
same empire with those who were styled
the legitimate officers of the Province.?
Abstractly speaking, how was a private
citizen to decide who were right and who
wrong in these local pursuits? And which
portion of citizens of the same province
must our citizens refuse to have any communication
with? But the boat was merely
used for one day as a ferry buat, and
on the night of the day she commenced
running she was seized, while moored at
tho. whanrf at Schlosser. and burnt, Se
veral men were assassinated; certainly one
who fell dead upon the dock. Now, the
insinuation of the British Minister that
Sehlosser was "nominally" within the
territory of the United States may well
be retorted, as we can with equal truth
say that Navy Island was "nominally"
within the 'territory" of the British Government;
at the period to which we allude,
the people collected there had as effectually
defied the Canada authorities as
any portion of our people had disregarded
ours. Yet British authority thought
proper to pass by Navy Island, then in its
"nominal" territory, and, in the plenitude
of its power, to cast the aegis of British
jurisdiction o\er American soil. This was
truly extending us that kind" guardianship
which they had not the ability at that
time to extend to a portion of their own
territory; and which recommends itself to
us, full as much from its assumption as
from its love of right or law.
The British Minister is pleased, also, to
call the Caroline a "piratical steamboat."
The loose epithets of any one, no matter
how high in place, cannot make that pira
cy which the law of nations does not recognise
as such. Pirates are freebooters,
enemies of the human race; and eminenl
jurists describe them as ravaging ever)
sea and coast, with no flag and no home
Piracy comes under the concurrent jurisi
diction of all nations. Even in the wors
: point of view that it can bo considered
( those connected with the steamboat Carol
f line were aiders and abettors of others en-1
- gaged in rebellion. And the committee
are totally at a loss to know upon what
authority rebellion is recognized as piracy.
i Such confounding of terms is resting the
case upon epithets, instead of sound law
i or facts. But even supposing it to be a i
; "piratical boat," as the Minister asserts :t i
. to be, yet the moment it touched dur soil I

power on earth conld rightfully invade it. i
There is no doctrine more consecrated i
in English history than that every human J
being whe touches the soil of Great Bri- I
' tain is immediately covered by rBritish 1
law. Suppose one of her vessejj were
cut from the banks of the Than&es and ]
burnt by Frenchmen, and British citizens
were assassinated at night, and theFrench 1
Minister were to avow that the^ acted <
under the orders of his Government, and J
that the vessel was "p'rat'ca'" and the I
citizens murdered were outlawf?then t
there is not an Englishman whoa* heart <

and vindicate the rights of his country.? i
The law there is the law here. Arid there i
is no international law consistent ^ith the a
separate independence of nations, that c
sanctions the pursuit of even pirates to i
murder and arson over the soil and juris- t
diction of one of the States of this Con- g
federacy. No greater wrong can be done t
to a country than invasion of soil. If it r
can be done with impunity at one point, b
and on one occasion, it can be done at j
another, and the nation that subm'ts to it j ^
.finally sinks down into drivelling iinbecili-;t
!ty. If a representation of the state of c
'things at Schlosser, and the conduct of r
those who had control of the Caroline, t
had first been made to the proper autho-1 r
pities of New York, or of the United t1
States; then there would have been Some f
show at least of respect for our sovereign-' f
ty and independence, and a disposition to F
treat us as an equal. Bat in this case, asjf I
to treat our authorities with contempt,. d
there was no preliminary demand or re- f
!?
prcseuiciiMii. 11ranc. ,
It was hoped that the outrage was per- c
petrated by a party in sudden heat and s
excitement, up>n theii own responsibility, i
But the British Minister now avows that a
' the act was the public act ot persons a
obeying the constituted authorities of her r
Majesty's Province," and agaic affirms $
that "it was a public act of persons in her t
Majesty's service, obeying the orders of 1
their superior authorities." i a
I If this had beerfthe first anil only point <
of collision with Great Britain, it might 1
'not liave excited such interest; but there
is an assumption in most of our inter- t
! course with that great Power, revolting t
' to the pride and spirit of independence in i
a free people. If it be her desire to pre- '<
serve peace her true policy would be to <
do justice, and show that courtesy to 1
equals which she has always demanded c
from others. The committee do not de- j
sire to press views on this part of the sub- 1
ject, particularly as a demand has been *
made by our Government upon the Go- <
vernment of Great Britain for explana- 1
tion as to the outrage committed, the an- <
swer to which, it is nopea, win pro* a ba- <
tisfactory. <
As to the other points presented iit the 1
demand made by the British Minister for <
the "liberation" of Alexander McLeod, s
the committee believe the facts of the i
case to be, that the steamboat was seized I
and burnt as stated before, and that a i
citizen or citizens of New York were
murdered in the affray. And there were i
reasons to induce the belief that McLeod <
was particeps criminis. He was first ar- I
rested, and upon various testimony beinjgf
taken, was then discharged. He was af- |
terwards arrested a second time. Upon <
the evidence then presented, he was im- i
prisoned to await his trial There was no ]
invasion of British territory to seize or
take him. But, iTpon' his being voluntarily '
within our territory, he was arrested as
any citizen of the United States, charged 1
with a similar offence, might have been, i
We know of no law of nations that would
exempt a man from arrest and imprison- i
ment for offences charged to be commit-1
ted against the "peace and dignity* of a
State, becaiuse he is a subject of Great
Brita<n, or because he committed the
crime at the instigation or under the Authority
of British Provincial officers; much J
less do we know of any law that would
justify the President to deliver him up
without trial, at the demand, and upon
i the assertion as to facts, of any agent of
the British Government.

Britain, and Mr Lend had committed the
offences charged, then he might have fal,
len under the rules and regulations of
t war, and been treated as a prisoner of
' the United States Government, and would
. have been subject to the laws of nations
in war. Bat as the alleged criminal acts,
t in which MeLeod is charged to be impli,
cated, were committed in profound peace,
it is a crime, as far he he may be concernad,
solely against the "peace and dignity"
of the State of New York, and her criminal
jurisdiction is complete and exclusive.
If the crimes committed be such
as to make a man hosfis humani genus?
an outlaw?a pirate, in the legal acceptation
of the term, then under the law of
nations, the United States courts and tribunals
would have jurisdiction. But the
uffence charged in this case, committed
as it was in time of peace, as far as this
jldividual was concerned, was one purely

The Minister, in his letter of the 13th
December, 1840, says:
"It is quite notorious that Mr. McLeod
was not one of the party engaged in the
lest ruction of the steamboat Caroline;
ind that the pretended cha rge upon which
le has been imprisoned rests only upon
he perjured testimony of certain Canalians,
outlaws, and their abettors," &c. '
fhis may, perchance, all be so; but it
vould be asking a great deal to require
in American court to yield jurisdiction, f
md surrender up a prisoner charged with ,
iffunces against the law, upon tne mere ,
pse dixit of any*man, no matter how
ligh in authority. Whether MeLeod be }
;uilty or not guilty, is the very point upon ,
vhich an American jury alone have a i
ight to decide. Jurisdiction in State tri- j
iun its o'jer criminal cases. and trial by a ,
ury of the venue, are essential points in
American jurisprudence. And it is a to- j
ai misapprehension as to the nature of j
?ur system to suppose that there is any j
ight in the Federal Executive to arrest <
he verdict of the one, or thwart the ju- ,
isdiction of the other. If such a power j
xisted, and were exercised, it would ef-(]
actually overthrow, and upon a vital ,
?oint, the separate sovereignty and inde- j
tendance of these States. The Federal ,
Sxecutive might be clothed with power to !
leaver up fugitives from justice for of- j
ences committed against a foreign State, ,
>ut even then it might not be obligatory to
lo so unless it were made matter <?f treaty ,
tipulation. Thiseduty and right in an i
Executive has generally been considered ,
is dormant, until made binding by treaty
irrangement. But wlien the matter is
eversed, and demand is made, not of fu- J
(itives from justice for offences commited
against a foreign Power, but for the ,
iberation of a man charged with offences (
igainst the peace and dignity of one of i
>ur own States, then it is that the demand
>ecomes preposterous in the extreme.? j
The fact that the offences were cornmited
under the sanction of provincial authorities,
does not alter the case, unless
ve were in a state of war. In such cases i
is the present the power to deliver up |
jould not be conferred upon the Federal
Executive by treaty stipulation. It could
>nfy be conferred in cases over which
Urisdiction is clearly delegated by the
Federal Constitution; such, for instance,
is treason which is an offence against the
jonjoined sovereignty pf the States, as de ?"I

^xcept those defined in the Constitution,
ind those coining clearly under the laws
)f nations, the States have exclusive jurisdiction
and the trial and punishment tor
Dflfences against them arer incident to their
separate severe:g lty. Jt is not pretended
n this case that there is any treaty stipulation
under which the detnano is made;
ind the Federal Executive, under our
system, has no power but what is conferred
by the Constitution, or by special Taw
af Congress. In the former, it is declared
that "the Executive power is vested in a
President of the United States," and that
power i9 then to be pointed out and defined
by special laws passed from time to
time, imposing such duties as are thought
proper and expedient by Congress.
Your committee deem it dangerous for
the Executive to exercise any power over
a subject-matter not conferred by treaty
r>r by law; and to exercise it m any case
in conflict with State jurisdiction, would
be worse than' dangerous; it would be
usurpation.
But your committee forbear to press
these points further at present, and they
wmnlH not have said as much on such
clear questions of international law, but
that in this case the demand for liberation
has been made by the accredited agent of
a great Power, and under circumstances
of peculiar ajggravation and excitement.
We have other points of difference
with Great Britain, which add interest to
every question that arises between us at
present. Neither our Northeastern or
Northwestern boundaries are yet settled1
with her, and the subject is not entirely
free from difficulty. She has recently
seized our vessels and exercised a power
involving the right of starch, under the
pretext of suppressing the foreign slave
trade. whrch, if persevered in, will sweep
our commerce from the coast of Africa,
and which is incompatible with our rights
| as a maritime power. She has recently, in*
her intercourse with us, refused indemnify
and denied our rights to property, oh a
subject matter vital to near onfe Half thb'
States of this Confederacy, and'which; '
considering Her military position at Ber-muda
and her growing power in the West
Indies, is of the last importanbb to our
national indpendencc. _ ;
All these subjects make every question .
between us, at this peculiar juncture, of
the deepest interest.

She moves steadily upon her objects '
with an ambition that knows no bound's;
and wherever she hds had a conflict' of.
interest she has rarely yielded to any '
Power.
At this moment she presents to the civilized
world the spectacle of ihe greatest
military and- commercial power in corubvation
ever known. . .N
From her vast possessions inevery'quarter
of the globe, and her peculiar commercial
system, she has been made the re-:
servoir of the wealth of nations. '
Her internal resources, skill, labor; and .
machinery, with her capital, are beyond
calculation. Her natural position being '
about midway the coast of Europe, gives ]
ler great control over the outlets and cur
rent9 of commerce.
Her military occupation of Gibraltar, j
VTalta, the Ionian Islands, and recently.of
St. Jean d'Acre, gives her ascendancy on ,
he Mediterranean and the Levant, wh3e ,
St. Helena and the Cape of Good Hope :
*ive her possession over the currents of
rade along those extensive coasts. Then
Bombay, Calcutta, and her immense pos- .
sessions in the East Indies, together with'
her recent movements in the China .seas ?
and Islands, enable her to extend her :
power over those vast regions that have ;
slumbered for ages in solitary and enervated
magnificence. She possesses Fafk- *
land Island but to control the Commerce '
that passes around Cape Horn, <rhile ...
Trinidad gives her all she desires in the
Caribbean sea. Halifax at one point,
and Bermuda at another, stand out in
great force over our own coast from one '
extremity to the other* . , .
Her positions all over the world are at a.
this moment, in a military point of view,
equal to a million of men under arms*? .
Her continual conflicts in the mighty re*
gioirs of the flast only enable her officers ,
to become skilful and to improve in the
art of war, while her great armies and ex- /
tensive fleets draw their support from the :
immense countries seized and occupied.?
In the present juncture of affairs, no >
statesman can overlook these things.?
Steam power has recently brought as so '
near together that, in the event of any fu- ;
ture conflict, war, with its effects, will be
precipitated dpon us with much more rapidity
than formerly.
Avarice and ambition are the ruling passions
of modern times, and it is in vain
to shut our eyes to the state of tilings
around us* It remains to be seen what
effect steam power is to have upon chang- j
ing and modifying the whole art of de- ,
fence and war. It may be a great en- ,
gine for again levelling mankind, and re
during every thing to a contest of mete
physical force. In that event it might be T
difficult to conjecture what system of nurt
tonal defence will stand the test of time
and experience.
We have a deep stake in peace, and '
fondly hope the repose of the world will
not be disturbed. We have certainly not
the least desire for any rupture. Firmness,
and a wise preparation, will long preserve
us from' such a catastrophe. But while no '
temptation should ever prompt us to do.
injustice on the one hand, so no considerotion,
on the other hand, should ever induce
us to submit to permanent wrong ,
from any Power on earth, no matter what
the consequences may be.
