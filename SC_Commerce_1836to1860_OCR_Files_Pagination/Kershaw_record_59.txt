We lay the following article before our'
readers?fur its interest, not from the

suggests". Why should wcT?orextend our
bcadaries to t)?r limits to which Mr. Jefferson
supposed they had gone, when he
acquired Louisian??The objection which
some of the Northern fanatics nave urged,
and which was taken by the Opposition in
the House of Commons, will clearly not

United Steles, ill not multiply the nam'*

if Texas be independent^

and will import further slaves from Cuba
or Africa.
The acquisition of Texas, is probably
?a leather to be referred for Gen. Jackson's
Cap. The Mew Orleans Standard asked,
on the 10;h of October, whether. "It
would not be well for the United States,
for Texas and Mexico, that the ,5rst should,

purchasing Texas, and securing her independence?

'The p<u>p1o of the Southern alavo ,

with Texas, indepjfodently of any

greatest cotton region in Ike worJJ. It it
not only more fertile of eottoa than the
Southern Slates, bulit produces a better
article. "There is lapd enough its Texas to
enable it to supply tine world with this great
staple, to lite exclusion of he Southern
Stale* from die market, hot the labor is j

used in- (he cnlturo of cotton. Now; if"
Texas becomes independent, she may sup-1
ply herself with, slave* from Cob*, and
speedily enter into competition with our]
Slates in (he production of cotton, at once J
depreciating the value ot ??nr slaves, our
cotton lands, and our cotton. The South
would never, therefore, assent to therecognition
of Tcxian independence, but
with the understanding that the country
shall bo annexed to the United Stales, and
made subject to our law* in respect to the
importation of slaves. The price of col*
ton will then be maintained, and the ralue
of slave labor enhanced ; because the
number of slaves can only be increased
by the means of their natural increase,
on whatever side of the Sabine they may
ultimately be concentrated. ,
''There can be little doubt, therefore,
in teres led as *11 parties and sections are
