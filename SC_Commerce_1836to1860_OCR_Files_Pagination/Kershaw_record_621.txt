THE FIRST EVENING AT SEA.
Fast to the East our vessel spreads,
With joyous hope the flowing-sail,
And, like the sea. bird, lightly treads,
The ocean wave before the gale.
Faint, and more faintly, now, the light
Fades o'er the dim receding 6hore;
And darkness wraps in pall of night,
The home that we may see no more.
Blcst-homc adieu! thy image, fond
Can never from my thoughts'depart;
But mirrored on the world bevond,
Will cast their shadows o'er the Heart.
Not that the soul should'wish'to know,
Events which sway all human pow'r! uy
But who alas! can tell the w6,
Thatmav atterid one single.hourl
i'. t <V*\ ' 'V ,
Sad change may come with all its gloom,
To bow the frame or crush the mind;
Or time may ope the vasty tomb
For each kind friend we've left behind. ..
And who shall say where his own lot
May lead his pilgrim steps' to roam?J
Shall we all see, once more, that spot
Dear to our hearts?our native home!
We cannot tell; but as Night throws
Its jewell'd mantle o'er our bark
So let my Soul, 0 God- repose
Upon thy word, Faith's surest Ark.

Where'er we go our ways direct,
Across the restles billows foam; v . _
And let thy Star, our ship direct; ^
Thy sun- i_h. bless our distant home.

"MURDER WLLL OUT."
About four years ago, a strolling or^an
player came to this town, and remained
C-.? - limn fin tin
iOr S w I II U llUir, MW|IJ|W MI4IV vxy
came acquainted with various persons in
different parts of the country, and' would
frequently go to a house in n neighborhood
and remain a week or ten days; following
tip his profession of "organ grinding,"
and from his-sociahatid -liberal character
[ soon became a favorite among the cnun
try people. . *
In the mean time it was ascertained that
lie had a considerable amount of money,
itvg'old'and silver/. At Long's Brjtlge, in.f
this countyj Jiq became acquainted with a.
man, whos^Uame we suppress,-^ ihe ?vlV
, de nee'a gainst him is altogeihyp'/circum;
istaminl, but quite conclusive"in ils^ciiarac-'"
"iter. This individual induced the orga'n
.player frequently to" accompany. him harm*
to play for his children?on one occasion
be tuok him to his house to stay ill night;
: Since which lime he has never been seen!
The people in the upper part of this cpunty,
and a part of Hancock, became much
excited on the subject of the sudden disappearance
of the stranger; but notwithstanding
the strong circumstantial evir
d n :e against the>*pposed murderer, from
some cause or other." he was suffered to
remove to Alabama, without the matter
being investigated.
A shoil time since, the brother of the
: supposed assassin was aresled -and committed-t'o
the jail of I-Ianci>cl; county, as a
vagrant, and being a troublesome fellow,
ami not notorious for his honesty, the citizens
were zealous in their efforts to obtain
evidence sufficient to convict him, and
thus rid themselves of one whom they considered
to be of bad character. During
* their investigations, Various particles of
evidence came to light touching the murder
ol' the organ player, and the' citizens
proceeded a: once to 'bring up a number
, of the connections of the supposed tnur^
defer, before an examining co nrfr*frr?result
of whlch'was, that the organ player
was ktVown to go to the house of the brother
of the prisoner on a certain night, to
stay all night; that he was seen by a young
woman in the house, to go up stairs to bed.
The wife of the murderer in a day or
two afterwards became insane, her mother
hearing of her illness, called to learn the
cause. Upon seeing her daughter's raysr
terious situation, she ttas confident that
something serious had occurred to cause
it. and accordingly left no means untried
to ascertain lite, true .cause of this sudden
mental derangement of hor daughter.?
After looking about-tire house for some
time and making" various wonders as la
what could be the cause, the daughter all
at once exclaimed, "mothcy, I dare not

pointing up to the loft, "have you no eyes
?can't you see for yourself?" .
V. The oltliludy upon turning,her attention
Ywihis paia-of the house, saw at once the
' cause of her daughter's trouble?a 'murjlel"
had been committed. There she saw
jplaiistyvstgns of blood where it bail drop'
ped from the upper floor, knd upon going
tip stairs found aj/real dpal more blood.?
It appears."that the individuals knowing
lliese tironms'.ances,-have kept them secret
up to the present-time, partly from a
regard for family cirnneetion> ' ./
A very strong circumstance agaipst the
"supposed murderer, was that,about the
-time of*the.disappearance of the organ
player, he was seen to have a large amount
of specie,, end a Certificate.af deposjle on
onetif"ih'6'Banks of Augusta, and 'the organ
pjayer wps known to have a large
amount ot specie aim a ceruncatc on an

have heard the truth, has been obtained,
to condemn the accused, and th&cHiztns

TREATMENT OF BURNS.
We find in a receiit oumtfer of the Lnn?"
don Medical Gazette vthe-following cam-'
nutnicatinnon'ihe treatment of burns by an
eminent Scotch phVsreiiin. s
Sir,?Considering the vast number of accident^
which daily occur by burning, it
may noPperhapp he unacceptable to the
profession ttrhave their jtlteniinjr directed
to an application which I have been inthei
habit ol using in such cases for some" time
past, with/very dec-ided advantage. The
plan of trea tment which I adopt and here
allude to, is nothing novel, and ninv, perhaps.
be^employed by many, if not known
to most. It, is therefore, wole)y with the
vie;y of detailing what appears to me, a'
most*vajliable form of anrdication. in ca
"Ses of burning, as well as of inviting its
more general use, tliatl xcw trouble, you
with these remarks. The more common
of the applications generally,.employed
appears to me liable to many objections.'
The common sweet or train oirisa re me-,
dy frequently resorted to, tu lire fiurry
, ' , - ; ;*> :w : . -
and bustle oflhe moment attending flrese
accidenls,,by frifrrids or neighbors of the
patten t who may* happen lo be present oi
the?time. .This application, loo, 'is notunfrequerilly
tsajrCiioned by the practitioner,
Grantingthe occasional ultimate
benefi of this ifpjpKcaliun, and Waving its
fi|iliyliatiire,.the strong objection to it is
this, t ha til seldom or never ail'ords instant
"relief t<? ihe suffering patient. The same
I think, holds true in respect of the jiuiitieniuin
nquaacfrlcts, or Carron oil, so very
frequently employed. The common raw
cotton, or wmjUnig has of laic years, and
perhaps deservedly too, held especial favour
as a local application. It must, however,
be admitted, that the patient derives
no immediate reHefc'to his sufferings upon
its first application; but, on the contrary,
oot un&e'qucT)^ complains 01 augmented
pain lor^meithiie afterwards. This may
very easily' bc'accoUnted for, both bv its"
Scting/ai art ftrilpting body, by its direct
co'viinct,.\vitlh.llvc .fed or raw surface, as
w<4l as by increasing for a lime 't!;e> 'letnperance
of the partto vyhiclrlt-may be op-'
pJicct; - Besides, it imafctV days becomes
saturated.wiih discharge from the; fic/crcW
frig surface, and .consequently- not, only
proves annoying tn the patient but also
the means of-Jteeping updischargc iirmore
trivial cases.';'The objections are in a
great meaiipjfegot rid of by using common
soapj tvhiciii.besides its great value as a
local application, commands the additional
advantage of always being at hand in cases
of emergency, The mode in which I
am in the habit^of employing it is this:?
A common sfiaving box may always be
procured, from which a good lather may.
in the courspvof-a minute or two, be easily
obtained. This lather is tiien gently laid
over the biwiit surface by means of a shaving
brush, and repeated so soon as the
first coal begins to dry, or the pain returns,
This practice ought to be repealed
ocfasionally during the first day, or.
iintilsoch time as the pain is relieved.?
The benefit accruing to the patent is immediate,
and the result of the practice
highly satisfactory, for in more superficial
burns, if early applied, vesication is
prevented, and, in the course of a few duyj,
desquamation of jhc cuticle follows, without
rii yfcatirfiirp Of cimr-e. this
as a remedial measure, is most apj licable
to superficial burns: but even in such cases
as involve destruction" of the more
deep tissues, it is pot used without advantage.
in so far as the personal comfort of
tiie patient is concerned. In such cases,
after the lapse of a few days, the-crust
formed by the soap is easily removed, 50
as to "permit the employment of other
-remedies, if necessary. I am not' prepared
to" say whether the benefit and instant
relief, following the application of lltf: lath-,
or, are to be ascribed to its chemical" composition,
simply to the fact of its affording
some degree of prelection from almojphcrick
agency, or both. Were it necessary,
I could easily adduce many cases in
illustration of its extreme value us a local
application; but as this would be needless,
ly encroaching upon-the .space of your
journal, I leave it to thosfe of the profession
who have not tested its clHedey* to
substantiate by the results of their ownexperience
the wnth of the preceding
statement. J remain, sir, your- very obedient
servant. 1 7 .
