extreme paleness, are induced to put faith
Ih the dazzling promises ot charlatans a ad
perfumers.
In every instance, these pretended rem.
edies cntud most dangerous conscquen*?:es,
especially when they are employed
for certain cutaneous affections which
arise from a disordered state of the system,
and which are, as it were, an effort
of nature to re-establish or preserve the
health.
If lead be once introduced into the animal
system, although in a very small
quantity, it can never be neutralized by
art, and never fails to produce the most
deplorable effects. Paralysis, contraction
and convulsion of the limbs, loss of
strength and the most painful ciiolics, are
its most ordinary effects.
We may easily imagine that health and
beauty are incompatible with the cxis
tenco ot such maladies.
A distinguished painter in London,
lately applied to Sir Anthony Carlisle,
about a palsy of the hand and tongue.
On i.iquiry, Sir Anthony found that the
patient, in one of his processes, habitually
rubbed a sugar of lead drying oil, with the
middle finger. By abstaining from the
practice he fortunately got well.
Even before the consequences show
themselves, the complexion becomes dull
and tarnished, and the skin appears faded,
wrinkled, and ghastly. As soon as the
deluded dupe removes the paint from her
face, she sees in her glass a skin so wrinkled,
and a countenance so ghastly, that
she redoubles the application of cosmct.
ics, till she has finally ruined her complexion
and destroyed her health.
The employment, says the same scientific
surgeon, of nitrate of silver for the
pretended cure of epilepsy, which it does
not effect, is well known to produce a horrid
livid colour of the skin, which remains
during life.
Baths too Hot or too Cold.
Even baths, if too cold, or too hot, are
injurious to beauty, by creating excessive
irratinn of the skin.
Cold bathing rarely agrees with slen/der
or delicate females; nor in general
^vvrth persons accustomed to an idle and
sfctktfitary life. It is injurious also to aged
persons, in whom the faculty ofproducing
I caloric is not sufficiently active to cause
ft an energetic reaction. The power of reft
action is in proportion to the strength of
die individual. It is slow with weak per^
sen?, who with difficulty recover warmth,
tremble for a long time, totter, and some- I
limes suffer acute pain in the head.
I need scarcely say that the cold bath
must always be hurtful, when, cither from
the temperature being too low, or from
the susceptibility of the individual, it causes
a painful sensation.
The cold bath will also be injurious to
every person affected with natural secretions,
or cutaneous diseases, susceptible of
being driven back.
As cosmetics, cold baths arc useful only
#o women of a full or sanguine habit; and
even they ought not to empfby tbo..., ?r.. (

it scaly.
Baths in the open air, and swimming,
^ from which bealthjuyit^nedicine derive
sometimes the most nappy effects, gradually
discolour the skin.
f * Cold ablutions applied to the head of a j
ft person not accustomed to them are also
HBrery liable to bring on headache, -inflam- ,

POLITICAL. 11
DEMOCRATIC OR LOCO FOCO DEPART. <
MENT. (
From the Charleston Mercury of Feb. 4. J
The Georgia Journal is mistaken as I ^
much in its complimentary attribution to I
others of the manufacture and responsibil- i
ity of our editorials, as in supposing that ^
i we have intimated we would not support
, .Mr. Van Burcn, should the Democratic
party prefer hirn as a candidate. It is as
wide of the mark as the Charleston Courier .
J which, as its want is, indulges a prepos
terous fancy, to wit: that if Mr. Calhoun*
were out of tho way, our great political
enemy, Henry Clay, could "be the second j
! choice" of South Carolina. We have no ^
ill will to Mr. Clay personally, but he is
politically anathema maranatha in this
State forever and forever. We do not
hold Mr. Van Buren to be our enemy on
the slave question: we know that he is
the friend of the South on that question.
What we complained of was that any
presses in his interest should be suffered
to assail Mr. Calhoun in such a proscriptive
and disorganizing spirit. We do not ^
believe that Mr. Van Buren instigated
those assaults or that he approves them.
We only hold him responsible for indo- ^
lently or indifferently allowing such nefaI
rious onslaughts to pass unrebuked when *
made by his partizans, for whose insubordinate
unfairness unless he and his true c
friends pointedly repudiate and check it, c
we have a reght to hold him amenable. c
D m
Pledged to the Constitution, and having a
made good their pledges by their deeds% ?
; by votes in Congress on this very t
slavery question, the Northern Democrats n
are the alies of the South, from whom we j
can never be divided, to make common c
cause with the Whigs who are the natural a
allies of Abolition, making common cause
with it against the Constitution, which is
the shield of the South. Should this at- P
tempt to .proscribe instead of being put
down, be encouraged at the North even
to the dividing of the Democratic party, o
the Southern divison of it may be isolated, fi
but, sure as fate, never can fall into the <n
Whig ranks, never, never! But there ti
will bo no sueh division, ' The nominee 0
of the Convention, whether Van Buren p
or Calhoun, will be supported by the whole a
Democracy.

hit from this quarter, it has been by the
recoil of a treacherous blow struck by his ne
own partisans, and he must blame them, Wi
and {hem -alone for the retribution. We ali

Secret Party Associations.?We n
lave before us a sheet containing an ac- e<
:ount of the proceedings of a meeting of is
Democratic citizens in the Eighth Ward, cl
:omprising some of our best and soundest ei
lemocrats, in which an able report on se- ir
:ret combinations was made, accepted, tl:
ind ordered to be printed. The report vi
fives the following account of the prac- bt
ices often resorted to by associations of sc
nen acting secretly, with an understand- is
ng among themselves, to turn political ct
lections in some way to their private hi
dvantage: pi
"The mode of operations which oar
olitical cliques generally pursue in order ^
o accomplish their selfish end^ is wor- 8P
hy of a brief description. Their main Pc
bject of course is to fill every public of- ae
ce with creatures of their own?with
len whom they can manage.' To effect ,n
lis object they practice two simple arts mi
f mysteries, viz :?1. The art of"making
olitical capital" for their instruments? ru
nd, 2. The art of "politically killing7' fQ1
ny man who, from his talents, integrity Wl
nd weight of character, may be likely
) stand in their way. The first named
rt is practiced thus: After deciding in C(*
icret conclave as to the individual to be ^
salted, (generally selecting some pliant, 'm
isy tempered soul, with as many nega- ue
ve virtues as may be, and none o'.her) an
io confederates go about to the different. ca
lacesol public resort, everywhere casu- ^
lly remarking that Mr, Such-a-one is ^0I
scorning quite popular?that they hear
im talked of very generally for such an Pn
Ticc, and he will no doubt get the nomi4lto?,
Sr** Tlu*y Hittr.naa his merits
ith great apparent indifference and can- de
)r?think on the whole he would be a ?
iry strong candidate?that he hasma^fp
ienas wno will be greatly dissatisfied, ""
id perhaps create a split, unless he is put bri
i tho ticket?and so on, according to sy
rcumstances and the temper of the per- wo
n addressed. Soon the m?n acluully '
talked of for the office by persons who C.V
not see the collusion and have no con- estl
iction with the conspirators; so what Pu'
13 a pretence at the start, becomes a re- ,s '
ity in the end. Thus, while each citi- evi
n knows that so far as he is concerned. vo<
r. Such-a-one is at best an object of ut- ma
r indifference, he is led to suppose that
e great body of the party are very anx- *ra
is for his nomination. Each one ac- Pro
rdingly stifles his own views out of com- P'a
usance to the supposed partialities of
} majority; vhile the real feelings of ^"eri
nost every individual in that majority
rrespond exactly with his own. e^e'
This farce is no less adapted to a large (
:atre than a small one. For instance? cou
! Democracy of the city are industrisly
persuaded that Mr. A. (of whom 1
:y know little or nothing) is the strong- mri
' I

ming districts are excessively anxious attp
his nomination?and they therefore sss
press their preferences for Mr. B., REI

ners along the river, and you will find
t they intend to support Mr. A. instead y
lieir favorite Mr. D. on account of his sjafT
at popularity at the north and west. 0f
the northern and western counties, COm
find they advocate Mr. A.'s nomina- ricul
i out of complaisance to the southern min<
of counties, and the spirited Demo- the <
:y of the city, where they are told Mr. T

ri- One of the first objects of those wV
>r . found themselves at Washington, npper
lJC ded to the administration of Gen. Jacl
son, was to perpetuate the power the
had obtained. Thcv were mostly a ban
or *
of uneducated adventurers, ignorant c
the world and of Government, and full
c prepared to illustrate the old adage?"pu
. a beggar on horseback, 6cc. &c." The
eir were out of position?a set of Goths an
Vandals in the midst of a civilization the
jss could neither understand nor appreciate
nd and in their ignorance, they trifled wit
is Government somewhat after the fashio
sh, of monkies in a China shop, and with th
)n. same result. They saw the immens
iat power and influence of the Bank of th
United States; but ignorant of the deli
IU cacy of the mechanism which kept tha
great machine in motion, they foolishl;
? supposed that it was a species of perpetu
ul motion?a kind of national clock whicl
e only required winding by official hands
^ to insure its running forever. Like chil
13 dren gazing upon the steam engine, tho^
he only saw its power without for a momen
he dreaming of the absolute necessity o
no keeping every portion of it in perfect or
o- der, to insure its working. In their igno
ranee and mad determination to retail
il. power, they determined to seize upor
n the Bank, and convert its power am
jc patronage to the party purposes of the ad
ministration. At this time Gen. Jack
son, Martin Van Burcn, Isaac Hill, Blair
yg ' # '
Lewis, Kendall, and every man or dema
CC in and about the administration
L O O
ll* was in favor of the'Bank and determiner
upon its re-charter. Gen. Jackson anc
ie Mr. Van Buren were so pre eminently
-'0 its advocates, that both of them had ap
c, plied to Mr. Biddle for an increase of its
ts Branches?Mr. Van Buren asking for one
it at Albany, and Gen. Jackson seeking for
r. a Branch at Nashville. But we speak
advisedly when we say, that all were in
rs favor of the Bank and its re-charter?for
T at that period we were their associate and
political friend, thinking as they thought
' upon this subject, and as *8 well known,
-separated from them because they, one and
1 all, abandoned their principles, and sought
'? to desiVfoy the Bank the very moment that
they were not permitted to control it.
While all was friendshi^and kindness
towards this great
r fi-11 _ J L
:s Isaac rim?a uemagogue who wouia nan
i- done honor to the Dantons and Marats ol
rg the French Reyolution, resolved that the
e President of the Branch Bank at Portland,
a Maine, should be removed from his posi?
tion, and a creturo of his own bo substi"
tuted. He satisfied the conscience keepj
ers of Gen. Jackson of the policy of this
measure and the necessity of having the
Bank under the control of the administraL*
tion ; and streightway Mr. Ingham the
" the Secretary of the Treasury, addressed a
'r letter to Mr. Biddlc, calling for the removal
of the President of the Portland Bank. Mr.
y Biddlc demanded charges against that offiy
cer; and when informed that his removal
e was demanded on the ground of his being
Y politically opposed to the administiation
. of General Jackson, he very properly reJ
plied that in the government of the Bank
, and its Branches, the mother Board knew
nothing of politics, and never permitted
the question to enter into their considersr
tion in administering the affairs of the
Institution. >Ve beg the reader to res
mr.rk that we are now detailing what
has become history and susceptablo of
' proof. A long correspondence followed
between Mr. Biddle and Mr. Saml. D.
* Ingham; and if we are properly advised;
i that gentleman has recently remarked
! that he looks back upon that period of his
i public life as the only one he would desire
to bury in oblivion.
In this corresponcence Mr. Biddle was
strong in his refusal to permit the Governj
ment to controul the affairs of the Bank;
and then it was that the Marais> the
Dantons, and the Sans Culolls who had
followed in the train of Gen. Jackson
when with his herd of Goths and Vandals
he took possession of the capitol, gravely
J determined they would destroy that which
' they could not controul and direct. We
; will do them the justice to admit however,
. that they knew not what they did. Ig.
I norant alike of everything connected with
1 monetory affairs, with commerce and with
' government, they vainly imagined that i
j the great and complicated machine of <
i government which they had seen work <
1 so well, and apparently of its own volition, I
| would continue to accomplish its purpose, i
They knew not, saw not, dreamed not, i
that there was any science in government; <
and that the commercial, the manufactur- I
iug, and the agricultural interests of the t
country were all dependent upon a well t
regulated currency. In their ignorance f
therefore, and to gratify their hatred of a
the honest and able financier, whose fpr L
seeing wisdom fortold the consequences g
of intermeddling with the currency, they t
grnvelj rushed upon the destruction of c
the Bank. Gen. Jackson however, could ?
not be at once controlled. He was avow, ft
edly a Bank man ; and for years after, p
he continued to admit the usefulness and fe
constitutionality of a National Bank, only d<
claiming the right ot preparing its re- hi
ch;utejv^-_ ci
ytz need not follow the history of this gl
crusade ngainst the Bank. Prominent i nt
unmix the expedients for dispencing with ?f
i National Institution, was the creation of j
~ ^ m
! additional State Hanks with large capita
.1 Unfortunately for the country, nt that^H
s period every Legislature in the countnMH
t with one or two exceptions, was under t'>^W
i direction of Jacksonisin; nnd in consc'I

) lo create new Banks, they promptly rC"
I sponded to the call, and in one year a?#*
t merited the nominal Banking capita* P
e the country one hnndred and twenty*9'*
v millions of dollars, and in two years, t*0

- lars!! Arid all this on the plea

?- j The intelligent reader need not^H^^^H
t? | that the simple fact that Jackson^^^^^H

d tat oM^lled into being upward^^^^^^H
)f | hundr^^%^-To:ty
y Capital, did not add to the actual we3t^^^
it or capital of the country one dollar. But
y I this immense number of Banks havilg
d ! been created, and capital diverted fro?
y other sources to put them in operation, it
; followed of course, that they must loa?
h out their money or they could not mak#
n dividends. But it will hardly be contene
ded that the creation of new banks will '
e create new business. Here were two
e hundred and forty million of additional'
> banking capital seeking employment, bat
t no additional business created by it.
y What then? Why a struggle ensued be>
tween these banks to find borrowers; and
h as mankind are prone to use money when
i, offered to them, borrowers were found;
but then followed another struggle heir
tween the borrowers to find the meant of
t profitably employing the sums borrowed.
f As we before remarked, the legitimate ^
- business of the country could not be
creased by the increase of banks ; and of
i course, speculation in public lands, and
i every conceivable species of property,
1 was the consequence, followed by the ex
travagance which this state of things en
gendered. ,
We pause here, and enquire of every
candid, intelligent man of both parties,
? whether these are not well established his-^^
i I torical facts? They most certainly are^j^r
I and in tunes like the present, should
r recalled to mind and calmly pondered
- upon.
i During the fictitious state of things * 5
! thus created, and the wild speculations
' and extravagance thus fostered, the
States, governed by individuals among
i whom this #nania existed, undertook to
' dcvelope loo rapidly their latent resources
and become borrowers in the European
markets of very large amounts. Their
credit was undoubted ; and offering six
or seven per cent, interest while the Governments
of Europe paid but three or four,
it is not to be wondered at that foreign
capital flowed naturally in this direction.
The British Ministry found their permanent
Stock rapidly falling in value, and
huvers of their Exchequer Bills as rapidly
diminishing; and the greatest a*
1 latin ?a*the very natural rnnscquence.
They saw v<^^sj>lainly, that if the credit
of our Statescefa^Mgdunimpaired, and
our country prosperon^Mlfci/ three per
cents would fall to fifty, andaTfr^loana
would necessarily be at the rate of"i
est paid by our States. Destruction ^
therefore, stared them in the face; and in':
self-defence, they determined through the J
Bank of England, to strike a blow at jbj
American credit. That blow come when vH
least expected; but even then had our 3
Government acted wisely, its too fatal
consequences might have been foreseen
and avoided. But instead of this?instead
of legislating to sustain the commerce
and credit of the country?the cry
of" Perish credit?perish commerco" was
sent forth under the auspices of Mr. Van
Burcn, a deadly warfare was waged
against the very Banks which Jacksonism
and Van Burenism had called into
being; and while the Bank of England
at the instigation of the British Govern,
mcnt, struck us a blow on the other side
of the water, Van Buren and his statelites
instead of repelling, gave it full force on 'W
this. Instead ef repealing the Specie Cir- /
j cular which Jackson in his ignorance had
issued, and thus enabling the Banks to ipymeet
the blow levelled at the credit of the
country, he proclaimed that "allwhotra- * 'j
ded on boriowed capital ought to fail/' kj
and left us exposed to the mighty crusade b
waged for the very existence of English & .
credit. It was a war of fearful odds. OnM
one side was the Bank of England backed^
by the British Government and every iqrr J
dividual interested in her enormous debF| 14
on the other, the American merchant,and J
the thousand and one State Banks of tm j
Union. The G.iveonmcnt of the Unitaf .1
States held in its hands the power to dv I
terminc the result. In whichever sea I
they threw their influence?to whichew
party they give their support?they ? fl
sured the victory. But alas for America
credit, American prosperity, and Atnei
ran patriotism! Van Buren and his sata*
lites thought only of themselves. He
hev had seen with how little trouble* 1
ivhole people may be governed* if onco II j
:rushed to the earth by the operation of a > j
lard-moncy system. He pointed to (wen. |
y-one nara momea governments wncra *h

ied, because ground to dust by starvation
ind oppression. IIo determined to rulo
iv breaking the spirit of the people ; and ??
frave/y and fiendishly determined, thrtt&
he Government should not sustain the*
redit of the country, but that all should f' *
perish" as his friend had proclaimed 1
om his seat in Congress, and the pros, 1
erity and happiness of the people be of. I
;red up at the shrine of his hard?moncy |
octrine. In short, he decided against i*
is country, his countrymen, and tho *

land and the English capitalists; and wjp
c now reaping mc nwiui consetjucncc*
