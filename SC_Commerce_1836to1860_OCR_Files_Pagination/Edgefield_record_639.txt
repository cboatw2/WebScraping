We know individuals who were engagedl
in merchandisiog, and who have abandon

whose fathers were farmers before them
that are now confirmied usurers. Yes, we
know them who bhtve parted with the last
family servant to the stranger. and the
proceeds dcrived from the sale, from now
part of a capital wherewith they shave
their neighbor. The house in which they

For him whose tnheritance it was, to be

he had laid down for hmnself to pursue,
will have at least the effiect ofinducigil men
to abandon the heartless profession.
While upon this stlject. and to show to
usurers the ground upon which they stand.
particularly in this circiut, we call their at
tention to thel followitig which we learn
from a member or the Bar. During the
court which has just terminated, a bill
brought in aid or a defeuce at common
law, seeking of the plaintiffsuing adiscove
ry of the usurious interest, contracted for
and received by him ofthe defendant-was
argued before his Honor Judge Cone, but
no opinion was given. The Judge, how
ever, was understood to say, that, neither
in Law nor Equity, under the statute of
Georgia of 182, could legal interest be
required to be paid by the person seeking
too establish the usuriuus transaction. In
the course or the argument, some one of
the counsel took occasism to speak of the
right of the patty who had paid usury. to
ue for and recover back all interest, which
had been paid by him on a contract conta
minated with usury. To this the Judge
replied. that, ss that question was not prop
erly berore him, he would not decide it
but ie was not prepared to say that he
could not recover it back.
One such decision. from so enlightened
a Judge, will do more to arrest the evil than
a hundred editorials. We have tho'agh
no desire to see it tested hy any one desi
ring to violate a contract made by himself
wiiah the usurer. Very far, front it. Let
all men abide by their contracts would be

Congress, and only awaits the ingnatnre of the
President. to become a law, to establish a line
of stages, three times a week from Rome in
Georgia. to Memphis and Commerce on the
M1ississippi River. Between Rome and Ma.
lison there is already a line three times a week;
mn that there wall be a continuous route between
Charleston and those pL.es. According to the
arrangement. the Mail will be buit .six days and
a half between Waslhingion and Memphis and
Commtuerce-this last named place is in th|
State of Mississippi, nearly on the parrallel of
ruscumsibia on the Tennesee. The route will
be put into operation during the Summer. The

when fully in operation, is likely to be one ol
great importance."

very apprehensive that Capt. Tyler wil head

It is strange to see these people one day quot

last war. and the next detnioncing him in anai.

country into a war with England. Their course
is certainly cialculated to ltioduce the very
