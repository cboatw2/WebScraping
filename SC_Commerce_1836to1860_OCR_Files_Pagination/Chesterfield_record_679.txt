Continued from pege 2.1. I p
from Virginia and Alabama are wrong in f
ihe construction which they givo to this
law. It is neither a command nor a re- <
commendation from Congress to the j
State Legislatures. They arc, however, i1
under the command not of Congress, hut !'
of the Constitution?of that Constitution
under which we are here assembled. I
. . M
which is the bond of union between the
States; which not only Congress, but the (
State Legislatures, are hound to obey; ]
and which every citizen who has the j j
heart of a patriot, and the spirit ot a man,
is ready to defend. '
The districting clause of the law reads j1
as follows ; ! ^
"Sec. 2. And be it further enacted. That ' <
in every case wheie a State is entitled to r
mure than one Representative, the nmn- j1
? - i hi .T.l I :<
her to which each State snail ne enuueu
under this apportionment shall he elected '
hv districts composed of contiguous tcr- 1
" ' 1
ritory, equal in numher to the number of
Representatives to which said Slate may j;
l?e entitled; no one district electing j
more than one Representative." h
Mr. C. defied the opponents of this ;
section to point out any thing in its lan. I
gunge,or in its context, which assumed i1
more the air of command to the State!
Legislatures than there was in the first. |
The first section prescribes the numher of i
members to which each State shall be
entitled; the second section prescribes!
that they shall he elected by districts; 1
and the Constitution of the United States j
made it obligatory on the State L"gisla
turcs to adept the rrgubiii'lfls necessary to
carry both into effect. The first section
cannot be carried into c.Tect unless the I
second is also; for, while it remains the'
law of the land, elections not made in
conformity to it will be null and void?un- ,
less, indeed, the doubt expressed by I lie
President of its constitutionality, together
. I
with other suggestions, may induce the
- ? ..." . i i
next House ot Kcpresoniaiives to uecuic
it unconstitutional,
The clause of the Constitution which i(
confers on (lie State Legislatures as well j
nsupon Congress .ill the pou^r which,
they can emTcise over the subject, reads _,
as follows:
"The times, places, and manner of hoi- ]
oing elections for Senators and Represen- { '
ta fives, shall he prescribed in each Statchy \ i
the Legislature thereof; hut the Congress '
may at ^ny time, l>v In w, make or alter !
such regulations, except lis to the places
of choosing Senators."
Tins language Mr. C. insisted, wan clear, rx.
t
*plicit,and commendatory upon the State Lcgisla- j
lures: it allowed them no discretion whatever. |
To Congress it confides a controlling power, to
" ' 1
make or alter the regulations as to the limes,
Jpiaces and manner of holding elections for Rep- j
rf-vnt-itiYcs. either in whole or in part; and to the
extent that the power is exercised, iy Congress,
and only to that extent, are the State Legislatures j
, ... f
relieved from the duties and obligations imposed :
ur>on them bv the Constitution. Thev arc as i
* % ' '
much bound by that instrument to adopt the re.
ccssary mcasu es to carry this law into eff ct, as
they would be to regulate the elections in case |
such a law had not been passed.
If the Legislatures of ane of the States sliculd ! '
. * i
unhappily be influenced by a predetermination to
oppose the law, rather than by a calm and candid
inquiry after truth, 'which he did not believe they
would)?by a spirit of faction, rather than by a dc\
% \
sire to perform tlteir constitutional duties?there
would be no limit to the objections that might be
urged. If Congress were to proceed, (as the op.
pencil!s of this law insist that we arc bound to do,
if w< touch the subject at all,) and, by grograpliifal
1 nes, divide the States into districts, it might
be urged, with met as much plausibility, that the
elections cannot be made, because, forsooth, C'onpress
had commanded the States to appoint the
managers of the elections, to provide the ballot. 1
boxes, and to designate the precincts at which the
elections shall be held. If Congress were to over.
/-.tn'oofi#?ns t,v .-tniMtintuifr the tivinaircrs.
* '' "X I o c- '|
designating the election precincts, &r.; still it
might be urged that it is an invasion of State
. i
rights, and the elections carrnot be constitutionally
held, because the State Legislatures are command- 1
IJ
ed to provide lor the counting of the votes, and j(
making other arrangements to complete the- re- j
... . } (
turns. Thus frivolous objections ini?r!.t bo piled
on each other, until Congress would be comp iled ^
to forego the exercise of n power clearly eonstitu- C
. t
tional, (and which, for the purpose of restoring
uniformity in the elections, we hi lieve to be now j
necessary,) or resort to the exercise of minute and ! *

This exposition could neither be controverted j
lor denied. |
To show some of the reasons for which the I
power had been granted, he would not detain the !
[louse longer than to read a short extract from the
remarks of one who had emphatically been called j
the " Father of the Constitution." In answer to \
in interrogatory submitted by Mr. Monroe, in the ;
Virginia convention, .Mr. Madison said?
u It was found inijrossible to fix the time, place,
ind manner of the election of Keprescnfative, in
;he Constitution. It was found necessary to leave
'he regulation of these, in the first place, In the
State (inveriwcnts, as being best acquainted with
he situation?of the people, subject to the control
if the General Government, in order to produce
uniformity and prevent its own dissolution."
It would thus be perceived that the object of
granting this power to Congress was to produce
unifomiitv, and prevent a dissolution of the Union.
That it should not be wantonly and unnecessarily
exercised, all would admit. But can any gentleman,
in candor, say that its exercise is not now
necessary, in order to effect one of the principal |
objects for which it was granted?to wit, uniform. ;
\ty? Ixiok around, and-behold the Rcprescnfa- j
fives of the people of seven States assembled in j
this hall, elected by general t'eket, and enabled to j
concentrate their entire respective strength ujxrn ,
every question of importance; while the people of1
die nineteen other States arc represented by dis. j
tricts, reflecting every shade of political opinion
entertained by those they represent, and frequently i
s > divided upon, important questions ns almost en- I
lircly to neutralize their votes. If Congress dor? ;
not discharge its duty in relation to this subject, j
and the seven States which now elect by general
ticket do not return to the district system, the ofh.
rr States, in self-defence, will he compelled to
aiopt the general ticket, even against their unhi.
asscd wishes. In the great State of Pensylvania, (
and in Maine, such changes in their respective !
systems were suggested shortly before the passage |
f this law. The contagion would extend ; State I
ifter State, in rapid succession, would adopt it in I
heir elections : and the power of Congress to ex- j
rcisc a control over the subject would he forever
rone. The States would he virtually represented
is States, in Imth brandies of Congress; and the
lemicratic principle of the government he extin- j <
ruished, without hope of resuscitation?the voiee ;
>f minorities in the different States would he silen;ed
in our deliberations?all questions of import- ,
ince would assume a sectional character?the i <
\Torth voting en masse against the South, the j
?outh en maw against the North ; and the minor. '
fy section would thus be made the " hewers of
vood and (he drawers of water" to (lie majority j <
ection of the Union, until comjxrlled to seek r?>- I '
uge from oppression in its dissolution. j'
Mr. C. could not suppress an expression of re- , 1
vi t at the efforts which have been made to give j j
6 this subject the aspect of a party question, lie i 1
iad introduced the resolution, which was the ori- !
in of the districting clause, without inquiring j
idiot her its adoption might or might not probably j i
end slightly to the advantage of either one party ,
r the other, in one or two of the States, at the 1
text flection for Representatives. Although vot- i v
nil upon all questions of irnpoitance as, according ' I
a the suggestions of his own mind, thev were eal- ' ,)
ulated to allect the rights and interests of his j
oustitucnts and country, even when those sua. | ?'
cstions separated him from his political friends, I
ie professed to be, and was regarded, lie believed, ! r
V all, as a member of the Democratic party. : t
/x>king uj)on this, however, as a great measure of I
[ form, important, if not essential to the preserva- ,l
on of our institution? in their purity, he could not
onserit that his course nj>on it should Ik- paralyzed j ,|
v the petty, teinjiorary consideration that it might, i n
ereh ince, be the means o! electing a few \\ higs i s

hich States n-i'dit, hv the general ticket, send all

He also expressed his disapprobation of the ef. "1

irofeaemg, and he believed truly intending, to go
or the country, independent of party.
Had the Democrats who voted against this mo- j
:ion voted for it, the bill would have been laid on i
In replying to the objection that Congress could
lot exercise part of its power over the times, man-1
ler, and places of holding elections for its mem- j
icrs, without exercising the whole; he said it was j
lot more reasonable than to contend that Congress j 1
:ould exercise no power over the raising of reve- j
lue, because it did not exercise the whole which is j 1
ronferred upon it by the Constitution. The tariff! j
lill now pending in Committee of the Whole, purKttee
to raise revenue only by the imposition of du. !
ties on importations; vet, however its constitution- j
ility may be questioned in other respects, no one J1
s so absurd as to believe that it is unconstitutional 1
iccause it does not embrace in it direct taxes and
xciscs?all of which powers arc conferred in the
'sine clause. That the controlling power confided
to Congress over the "times, places, and manner" j
if holding elections for Representatives may be ex- '
crciscd at its discretion, either in whole or in part, j
lie thought it was manifest ; 1st. From the lan- <
guugc of the Constitution. 2d. From the pro- !
c codings of the Federal convention that framed it. |
!>d. From the proceedings of the State conventions (
in adopting it; particularly from the resolutions of
seven out of the original thirteen, indicating a
wish uhat the Constitution should l?c so amended ;
as cither to take the |>o\ver entirely from Congress, i
or modify its exercise ; and, 5th. From the expositions
given to it before and at the time of the !
udoption of the Constitution, l>o*h by its opponents !
and advocates.
He would detain the Housejo read various extracts
to sustain this view ; yet he could not re- i
train from quoting the remarks of one of the most '
talented and influential opponents of the Constitu- j
tion?Patrick Henry. In the Virginia convention
Mr. Henry said:
'The control given to Congress will totally destroy
the end of suflcrage." * * * " Congress is
to have a discretionary control over the time,
place, and manner of elections. The Representatives
are to be elected, consequently, when and
where they please. As to the time and place,
gentlemen have attempted to obviate the objection, j
by saying that the time is to happen once in two J
years, and that the place is to be within a particu- !
lar district or in the respective counties. But how ;
will they obviate the danger of referring the man.
tier of election to Congress ?" * * ^ "The power
r?vcr the manner admits of the most dangerous latitude.
Thrymay modify it a* thry pirn nr."

have been inserted, in the first instance, without
Democratic votes; and that the motion to lay the
the table by a majority of eight vote*. Had the
Democrats and Administration men who voted
against this measure voted for it, the bill would
have been laid on the table by a majority of six- (
teen votes. Thus it was evident that the bill was
carried, not by an exclusive party vote, but that it
received a respectable support from every party in 1
the House ; and without the support of a portion 1
of the Democratic party, it could not have been '
passed at all in its present form. In addition to
this, it may be remarked that there were three
gentlemen of the Democratic party, and one Ad- i
ministration man, who voted for the engrossment <
of the bill, (the districting clause included,) that
either voted for the motion to lay on the table, or
did not vote for it at all.
Except in alluding to the question of privilege,
and the restriction which he conceived to be imposed,
both by the letter and spirit of the Constitution,
on the President, in the approval of bills, Mr. C. (
had not extended his remarks beyond a reply to
the construction placed by the President on the
districting clause, an answer to the attacks made
upon the law by one of the gentlemen who defended
him, and a slight reference to the repeated attempts
made by a portion of the press to excite a
spirit of opjxjsition to it. He would now briefly
reply to that part of the exposition which related to
the constitutionality of the feature of fractional representation
embraced in the law, but could add
nothing to the remarks which had the honor to submit
to the House upon that subject when it was
under consideration. He would, therefore, conclude
by expressing the hope that many returns of
the glorious anniversary of American Independence,
just pissed, would witness the representatives
of the people of the States assembled in this
hall, consecrated to that independence, elected in
conformity to the provisions of the law which, how.
ever much reviled, was intended, and he believed
calculated, to restore uniformity in elections, and
equality in representation; without which, the
form of our Government may remain, but its
spirit will have departed.

An Elementary, Complete, and Methodical j
Course of Rural Economy, with more than
Two Thousand Engravings, representing the
various Implements, Machines, setsofApparatus,
Breeds of Animals, Trees, Shrubs, and
Plants, Rural Buildings, etc. Digest and
Revised by a Committee of Scientific and
Practical Agriculturists, belonging to the -Agricultural
Society of France, under the direc- |
tioii of M.T. Bailey, Member of the Societies
of Agricultural and Horticulture. Translated
from the French, with Notes adapting it to the
use of farmers in the United States of America,
by Elizur Wright, Jr.. formerly Professor
of Matthemalics, and Natural Philosophy in
the Western Reserve College, Translator of
La Fontaine's &c.
Agriculture is the foundation of all human
arts?the art for which man was made, and j
the perfection of which is his chief happiness j
and glory as the lord temporal of this planet*
Of this sublime art, all other arts and sciences !
are but satellites, their business being to wait
cn, enlighten, and adorn it with their moonshine.
Consequently no man more tlian the
agriculturist needs the full use of his brains,
and a perfect command of ail the treasures of
human experience. So the farmers of the
United States view the matter; and in presenting
them with a translation of the cclc.
brated Maison Rustique, of the French, we
have no doubt of their hearty support. It ic
the work of all works on practical agriculture
?the most scientific, clear, and ci mprehensive,
France has long excelled in profitable
farming. This is the source of her wea'th.
England is rich by coals and commerce. Her
agriculture is splendid, but sometimes costs
more than it comes to. Those who have
fortunes to spend may buy the vast works of
Marshall, Dickson Arthur Young, Loudon, j
&c., but those who wish to gel a fortune out '
of the soil will find the French writers better
able to show thein the way. The excellence '
at French elementary works is well known to
all teachers. For centuries, the Afaison
Rustique lias been, in France, the standard
elementary work?the spelling book and
grammar of farming. The present edition for
" the nineteenth century," has bean re"written
and brought up with the " march of mind,*'
by sixty of the ablest "agronomes" of France.
11 has all the light of the latest improvements,
nor only in Frauc.e, but in all Europe.
William Cobbef, one of the most successful
fanners both in England and America, who
wrote the best style and the best French
grammer tlrat ever was, valued the Maison
