British Holders of American Stks.
The following is a reply which 31r. Ever

holders of Anerictne stocks in thit coiun
try. The object of the memorial we fully
explained in our ast number. The reply
does credit to the head and heart of the
American Miuister, to the Court of St.
James; it is justly admired here. und will
be still more appreciated by his country
mten. The :teemorial, we ought to state.
bore the sigentures of 900 hulders of the

'-Mr. Schollfield and Gentlemen --In
comipliance with the request contained in
the memorial which you have now pre
seuteI to re, .-will avail tnyself of the
firyt opportunity of transmitting it to the
President or the United States. To avoid 1
misconception it is proper that I should
observe, that inasnuch. as the general go
verrnmeut is not a party to the rentracts
of the separtte states, 1he s.ihject of the.
memorial does not fall-directly within the
President's province. nu that I :c huny
self acting unnfficialy in fiorwarding it to
him. - I do it,-however. with cheeruiluess.
Out of respect to the muembers of -thio dii
tinguithed depvtntiaon. Nor am 1 less iu
der the infiueuce of the deepest sympathy
%%ith that numerousi class whom you rep

of them I foar ruinously. from the failure
(twporiry, I trusrj uf a portion (f the
Amerian stics to pay the interest of
their public debt. These Iielings, I am
sur. will be shared by the President.
"I concur with you in protesting against
the doctrine that abtaiewhich has pledged
its faith and resources, can release itself
from the obligation, however burdensome,
in) any way but that of honorablc pay
ment. Fatal delusions, in times of great
distress, occasionally come over the minds
of commutnitics as well as iulaividisd ;
but I r-juice in lhe t:cli'f that the unuteber
i6 exceedinigly esmall of those who have.in
any fri. advanced the idea of what Li
been catlled -ropudiation.' I htll couviiced
that those states. which unhappily havc

duon their boads. have done so tuier,
t.e heavy pressare of adverse circuitan

,.The position, ge-ntlemern. of soma xa
leas~t of the iudeted States.,is -as singulr
as ia is deptoeble They have invaihed
theomselvei amost unadvisedlly ini en;;ago
mernts which would be oeneus toe much
larger and richer comcmunities; andJ they
yet possess, under an abntost hopeles.
prcsent em~barrassmcent, thte uelneubted
means of eventuual recovery. I will take
the State oif Illinois fr ristunee. and what
I say af that State asill hold of qthers.
making allowance fact dliference of local
cijcumnstances. The State of Illinois uu
dertook .a fe w year' since the conlstructioe
of a ship canal of abouet 100 mili in
length, to unite the waters of Lake Michi
gan usith those of the lilinois river ; and
moro-recently projected end commenced
the esecutioni of 1300 miles of 'railway.
On these works mace ha. borrowedl and ex
pondled above 20,000.000 of pounds. T~ze
work -is incomplete arnd sonprodnetive.
The. populhation of t be Stato is that of a
secoted sized English county, short of half
a million. It is what in good times would
ho conisidered an.- emuined~rif proeJerous
population ; butil am inclined to think
that if rhe Englishincometuaof lastg'ear
were, by the -Legislature of -Illinois, laid
on that State, more than half -the popuala
tion possessing in the aggregate that pro
portion of taxable pronpsery, -would, in thme
present period of general distress. faell be
low .the point of esemption. and that of
the other half a small number only would
r ise above that point.- Andl yet the un
fdeveloped resources of llinois are almost
boundless. The State is larger than En
glaod and Wales. Bly the Mississippi it
is counectedl with the Gulf of Mexico, by
Lake Atichigan with the St. Lawrence;
and it has a most eztensive internal navi
gation by means of several noble rivers.
The clinatne of the State is mild ; it con
taius, I suppose, as large a body of land,
not merely cultivable, but highly fertile,
as can be found lying. together in the Uni
ied States; it abouide in various kinds of
mineral wealth , it is situated about in
the centre of a horizontal field of bitumi
nous coal. which Mr. Lydell pronounced
the other day to is as long as Great Bri
tain; and it is inhabited by an industrious,
frugal, iutelligcnt people, tuost rapidly
increasing iu numbers. That sauch a peo
ple will for any length of time submit to a
total pvristratiou ofpublic credit I can never
b3lieve.
-I btir,gent!emen. the loss as well as
tie. reproach, for vwidespread and severe
as has been the sufering in this count-ry.,
enused by the default of some of thestao% I
mar own losses, public andl private, I be
lieve to base becn greater. -The states
thermselves, as govcrnments, have expe-I
rietced the greiest embarrassmeonts frrn
the sudden destruatiou of crediL (er~'nd
Ittg alike 10 Ihose states which have andl
those which have not he,uornbly and
promptly set their oblhgationit) hfti credit
on which alunc, iu some instances, they
.epenaded for the resources neeessary .toa
omplete and render productive their pub.
4c.%yorks. -Tbo grneral Government of
the united Sintes, after havine paid oti a
>ublic debt ul nore than 2S00,00),000 of
dollars, has found itself unable to negwtiaie
a trifling loau in this great metropolis of
the finatcial world, whose superabundant
apital, but for th1e default of some of tie
states, would have conueinel to be for
those states thenbelves, and for inldividu
a. a vast gold mine of unexhansted ca.
pneity. In addiaiu to these public em
larrassmenti private fortunes almost it ith.
out nuumber have Weelldcstroyed. in- the
gener.al wreck of which the failre (if the
taes. as caute ur efTect, is one of the prin
:ipal elementi. I doubt, if, in the history
irf rle w orld. in so short a period, such a
transaction bs been made from a state of
high prosperity to one of geaneral di,4res-.
as in the United States within the last 6
venrs. Auil yet, genleten, the elasticity
ad power of recovery in the couutry are
reat beyond ihe conoeption of those n ho
o uot know it from personal observation.
-ven within this disastrous period, to
which I base alluded, a private commer
ial debt to ihis county, estimated at twen
iy five millions of pounds sterling, has
been pail by the American merchant.
with as little loss to the credi'ers as would
attend the collciin of an equal amount
of domestic dcbt, in this or any other
country.. .
"But I will not detain you. gentlemen,
by enlarging on these topics. Tie sub
jec, I need not tell you, is one on which.
in a1 respetis, it is proper that I should

The seports in the Texan papers go to
show that several of the prisonels have
arrived at dil'erent poiu:s, who state that
he majority of their companions, after a
succsful attack upon the guard at 8a
lado, succeeded. in reaching the settle
mets of the Rio Grande in safery. but
after mtuch sutfrring. rThey confirm, to
the fullest extent, the death of Dr Bren

so state that some two or three smore were
killed, but do not mention the name of

apprehending an anack from the Mezi

determined to hazard an attack upon the
town. When they entered the place the
Miexican troops were already drawn up
to uppose them, but such was the impe
tuosity of the charge of the Texans, that
the ruops of the enemy were routed in a
few minutes. Between six and 'seven
