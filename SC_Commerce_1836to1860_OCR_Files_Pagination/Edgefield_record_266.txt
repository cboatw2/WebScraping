PROPOSALS
FO1 REVIVING TI
Southern Review.
T tlaSnbscriber, o proposig the r.-s
talishment of tte Sourern Revi. w,
deems it utinnecessay to refer to the history of
that work, which is already in t;e poss, ssion ot
the public, or to dwell on the high esimration i,
which it was held both at home and Libroad. dn
ring the period of its cotinnnance. Surnice it
to say, that its career, though brief, was, as all
admit, brilliant-creditable to the .--outh and to
the whole American Union. Its failure- the
rsubiect of universal regret-waws owing, it it
wen known, not to a destitution of talent and
public spirit, but arose lst, from its limited cir
culation, which was by no means adequiate to
sustain a work of such magnitude, aid 2ndly,
from the political diffierences n hich agitated the
country about the time of its discontinuance,
dividing the friends of Southern l.ierature n.
to two great parties. and pieventim that har
mony of opinion and-Co-operation mu the dis.
cussion of leading questions, which is desirrble
in a work professedly devoted to the cause of
the South and the whole South.
It is proper to consider first, the utility of
Reviews. regarded as organs of the literary spi
rit and opinions of the age. and secondly, the
imaportance and necessity of establishing snch
a work at the Sotmh, at the p.eseit tnie. On
the first point, it is scarcelv nrcesnrry to say
mouch. in the present advam-ed stage of period
ical literature. Ably conducted 'Reviews are
the offspring of a high state of civilizatiorn. ansi
are hebest evidence. nnw-a-dav.s. that carn he
furnished of intellecntual advanceomeut. and the
prevalence of a pure and elevated philosophy.
l'ie inst half centur Ias produced few au
thors of eminece. either in Great Britain or
America. mn comparison with the half c.-nitry
that preceded it, and the reasor probably is. not
that there has been a want of genius. talent and
scholarship in this confesedly intellectual age
hit simply because distingni.led scholars have
found a readier and a better oran through
which tit act directly on the public mind inI Re
views. than through the medium of books-the
old, more tedious and more expensive methol.
If therefore, it be asked, 'hat evidenrce is or
can be firnished of the superior intelligence
and progress of thd present ceinttry-a pro
gress of which we are so apt to boast-the re
ply is that it is to he ounnd in the hith character
of the tuarterly Iteviews abroad and rat horne.
If it he alfirmed, that we have rno native fifera
tore ins this couitry, aid thereforeno inmaterials
to furnish the -round work for Reviews, tie :,n
swer is, that our Reviews constitut' our native
literature, and that i learning and sc!iolarship
arc sought for, they are to lbe found in omr Re
views, which therefore should he warirly and
firmly supported, as an evidence, and a fair one.
of our literary pretenusions and our nationual
character. Besides, nio one cause, it may be
safelv aulirmued, has contributed so much to eli
cit talent, to awaken literary ambhitiou, and to
pI'odnece the highest order of fine arid pow~erfuil
ufriting, as the establishment of Revir-ws; and
marry individuals have been stimulated to ex
traordinary efforts, and have been subseqiuenrtly
known far and wide to fame, ini consequence ot
the oprportuinities they have enjoyed arid impiro
.ved, of cointriburtirng successfully to works of so
influential and highly respectable a chiaract
individuals, who, otherwise, in all prohnhiility.
'would never have besen tempted to test their
strength on the literary arena with such compel
itors as they would be likely to meet rthere.
The great aim of Reviews is, to discuss sub
jects learnedly,thoroingbly,profounidly-inl such
a maniner as toi bear uapon thre whole social sys
tern, and pro.uce a broad, deep and permnanenrt
imnpressiont npon the general characrer of a peo
plec: In one word, their object is to diffulse
knowledge. not-to foster prejudices-to create,
direct and control-not to echo opinions-to
prodnce beneficial changes upon a large scale
-not to pierpetuate or even tolerate existing a
buses. It- is obvious, therefore, that while, in
the iofancy of American literature a spirit of
indulgencea has been felt and extended to tihe
funks of our lighter periodicals, which are rap
idly issued from the prs'ss, and which have
ser ved as vehicles often for the attempts of the
mere literary debutant, Qtuarterly Reviews,
havintg higher aims to aceemplishr, and intend
inig to represent and~ emhody, in the most p ow
erfid and attractive form, thre opinions only of
thre mnost enlightened whriids shouldl be con
ducted with a scrupulous regard to thre purest
principles of taste, and to tire elevation arid ad
v.ancemrent of our literary and riational char
acter.
In respect to the importance and necessity of
estah'ishrmg such a work at the Sonth at tire
present time, there can he little dontbr irn the
minds of our discerning and public spirited
citizens5. We must have such a work, or feill
behind tire spiuit etf the age. wich is of a pre

frigal meal of milk and mush. but befor6

Gnnxm TEA, a REt.ny FOR BURNS
AND ScALDS.-The Medical and Suraical
Journal publishes a communication from
Dr. Wheeler, of Unionville, recommend
ding on experience or its good effects
Green Tea as a cure for burns and scalds,
The Dr. says:
It is about three yearssince I first applied
this article in these eases, but in this short
time I have had repeated opportunities of
toting its virtues. The first case in which
I employed it was that of a child, three
years old.whose clothes were literally burnt
of from it. It was cured by this articlo
alone, and notwithstanding large portions
oftno only integument, but muscle also,
sloughed out, the cavities were soon filled
with healthy granulation, and the' cica
trices formed a smooth surface. Since
that time I hav*reated other cases, of
.more or less severity, in the same manner,
and willh similar success. Treated in this
way the inflammation soon subsides, & the
healing process is astonishingly rapid. Itis
always necessary to keep the bowels suf
liciently open with some cooling laxative,
as crem, tart, or sulph, magnes. Any of
t he green teas may be used. It is to be
moistened with warm water to render it
soft,and applied in the form ora cataplasm,
Perhaps it may he more conveniently em
ployed forming it into a cataplasm with
itdial meal. When the burn or scald is
in a situation that renders this formi im
pracicable, the injured part may be kept
constatly moistened with a very strong
irinnsion, I should suppose the extract
would he an elegant form in which it might
he employed.

to doubt will pay for!
"There are but two ways, friend, to 'a.
