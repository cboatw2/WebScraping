Ah! neyer frot your hearts erase

'Tis time to sing your evening hymn
Mly youngest infautdove,
Come, press thy velvet cheek to mine,
And learn the lay of love.
My sheltering arns can clasp you all,

Cling as you u,'d to ching to her.

Come, warble loud and clear
Alas! alas! you're weeping all,
You're sobbing in my ear
Good night-go say the prayer she taught,
Beside your little bed,
The lips that used to bless you there
Are silent with the dead.
A Father's hand your course maay gnide

THE GRAVE.
"We lIike to see one write cheerfully about
death."-Southrn Literary Mecsseager.
Wnir shroud the grave with thoughts or gloom,
Why palD the soul in solemnn sorrow!
The dead at rest-we follow aon
There calmly laid-perhaps to-maorrow.
'Tis but the convocation ground.
Whre empires past have met.
Kingdoms presnt-ay e all are bound
Then why feel terror or regret?
Tis silent, true-shall this give dread !
Rejoice that all the clash and strife
Are done, and buried with the dead
And all the pangs and griefs an life.
e cheerful! tranquilize the soul!
'Ts the noiseless wicket gate to llea'een.
Or step we take to meet the scroll
Of immosity-a life for death is given.
Then clear thy brow from pensive cast
L.et grave's cold dreani weave there no wreat]
For absent ones...they're gone-they've rust
The grave!-'tis but our mortal epitaph'

"Rol ME TIHE EXCIEQUER THE FIRSI
THING THOU DOS'T."
The Whigs in Congress and in the Le
gislatures of ihe Whig States, are carryin
out this principle with a rush-robbing the
people zealously and deeply for the benefi
of themselves, or of native capitalists and
speculators, and British stock jobbers.
The first act of the Relief Congress waw
to rob the people of their public domain,
to make good the speculations of foreigr
harpies on the state's improvidence
'Rob me the Exchequer,"
Was the cry of the l'euns% lvania. Bank
and it w as done to the tlu of half a uilliot
-as will be seen by the following para
graph which, uncontradicted and indispu
tai~le in its assertions is circulating in tht
Democratic papers of Pennsylvania.
"Let it be constantly kept in mind. and
let no two Democrats meet and part with
out making it a subject of sp'ecial remark,
that if the federalists itn the last Legisla
ture hid followed Gov. 'orter's recoi
dation to sell the Bank stock owned by the
State. 'he passagc of the so called "relicfl
law would have been necessary, and morc
than half a million of dollars would have
been saved to the state, as the stock refer
red to has depreciated that amount, and it
is every day going down lower. Eventu
ally it will be -vorth nothing! Such are the
fruits of federal I:gislatiou."
"Rob me the Exchequer,"
Was the cry in the Whig Legislature of
Connecticut, and the Whig Legislators set
to work in dead earnest, every ian for
himself. We copy the remarks of' the
Pennsylvanian preceding the Hartford ac
count of this truly Whig transaction:
DtRtING ttoUul.vy OF A ST.%TE.
"The Legilators of Cottecticut, if time
following account be correct, imttst be as
greedy as somen other Legislators whom we
have heard of. They are a good deal worse
than those of our own state, or we have
never heard of their runining oil with the
inkstands, wafer boxes, &c. which belong
to the desks. Will the Times infiorn us
whether these practices are sone of the
swteady habits" ofConnecticut, or whether
the scene referred to was only anl occasion

a show the people what they meant by

was nppropriated to the purchase-of such
articles as were considered necessary or
onivenient to L.egislative house keeping:
such ais pe knives, inkstunds, sand and
wafer boxes, ivory folders. steel lets. (1uili.
fine paper. sealing wax. &c. &c. Wefl.
rhen these patriots adijournted, iii addin ion
to their takiit pay for more dtys than
they worked, they actually stripped the
.hip of State of every thing they could
lay their hands on ! pouncimg otn the
property of the pellple like so many
liarnegat wreckers. This. they probably
call "restorin confiden.ce," 4C. Such a
cleat sweep did they make. says the Ilart

The following intelligence, from th
Standard of Uniot of yesterdaty, confrnt
the statemen'tts. we publishedl in otcr lsti p'
per from the N.York~iournatlof Comlmerc
ad Express.
"We have the pleasure to anntounce. thn
Ithe debt contracted by the Central Hanl
..md.. Governor G;ilmer's administratio,
with the Phcenix Bank of New York, has
been fully paid ol' and discharged, and
that the bonds given for that Debt, and the
coupons for interest upon State Bonds
which were sold to raise funds for theWes
tern and Atlantic Rail Road, have been
taken up by the President of the Central
Bank. who returned a day or two since
from New York, and are safely deposited
in the Bank."

were not aware at the time we gave an
account of this affair, of the truly firmida
ble stand the thievcs had taken, and the
general terror they had inspired. A cor
respondent of the Chicago Democrat, wri
ting from that country, says "Society
seems to be divided into two classes-those
who do not; the latter expecting every
night they lay their heads upon their pil
lows. to ho murdered before another sun
rises." The thieves had set the laws com
pletely at dinarce. They sent letters to
several individuals threatening death; they
burnt Long's mills on Kilbuck creek: they
even went so far as to challenge the whole
community it meet them at Driscoll's
Grove to decide which party were the
stronger by a pitched hatite-and they
capped the climax ofiheir previous villainy
h~v the deliberate murder of Mr. Campbell.
here was a truly lamentable slate of
things, and( calculated to ronse excitement
to the highest pitch, The ringleaders were
taken, ind summarily tried and executed.
There may be cases where, through the
ineiciencv of the laws themselves, or the
inability of tile local inagistracy to entiorce
them, a community, like an individual. i's
thrown back upon the law of self preserva
lion. This may have been such a case.
But if the people, numbering probably ten
to one to the thieves, were competent to ar
rest and bring them to a summary trial,
were they not equally compietent to secure
them while awaiting the law's delay!
They had no reason to distrust the estah
li,hed tribunal. Judge Ford, at the last
term of the court in Ogle country, showed
no disposition to favor rogues, several horse
thieves and counterfe:iters having been
sent to the penitentiary, and it ouldseem:
from this that the laws were
pletely inefficientassono.

'er ltigland, if she dare, attempt her pro
cription of the products of slave labor. As
jIoln as she did so, the continents of Eu
pue would take them. Gentlemen who
choed such a cry knew nothing of the
me poilosophy of the question. but yield
d to maligntant prejudices, which blinded
beir better judgment. Mr. P. insisted that
he true contest lay between the enlighten
d sliirit of the presi age and the bond
ge of the dark ages. lie went into an ar
ument to show that the cTect of protec
ion was hostile to the interests of the Ia
urer. so that the contest was between the
ree wages of labor and the proffits of capi
Al.
Mr. P. in the next place went into a
tatistical calculation, in which he showed
me ell'ecis of altering the system of draw
acks. anti insisted that the drawbacks
'onld be reduced. and also the expense of
ollectiotn, and that the revenue shalB yield
wenty-four millions. If the public lands
rare to be added, the amount would be
%ised to twenty seven and a half millions.
Lad was not that more than enouh for an
~-' nstrtion, with an
wen o mUllrons a year, bad
aid 'the national debt; and was it come to
bis, that this reform Administration, afier
ill its promises of retrenchment, was con
ent to take the expenditures of the last
aid-to-he wastefiul Administration as the
asis of its calculation for the next four
ear,?
M r. P. had no objection to the principles
f the bill. Let a duty of twelve aud a
alf ier cent lie imposed upon articles now
ree, 4atnd on all articles paying a less duty
lian ?t0 pr. cent. This would yield $9,190,.
ut. Put the protected articles up to
wenty per cent. next year. This would
ivc twelve millons more. Then adds
tree milliuta. for the public lands. and you
Voild have total of $24,160,000. And
ras int this enough in a time of profound
>eact! Were all the denunciations of the
:i.t Administration niere humbug! Mr.
'. conutendeIld that the expenses should not
it over eigIteentt millions. This would
cave a balance ofsix millions in the Treas
ry, *mnd t hat in four years would pay off
he loani.
Mr. 1'. agreeAl with Ilarnard that the bill
t::S not w anming ns a measure of revennue.
Iliv. then, produce such a universal shock
ii ,itmmierce, and derange the business of
hre cotuntry still more than it was iu 1837!
Shtv produce a convulsion! why not pre
er nt .;:radual process! If. however en
inhtrenedl mei.rchiants who had look to this

bmr it. They can bear it from their mas
