But I trust the Senator from TenW
nessee [Mr. Grundy] will give us an op*
portunity soon to enter fully into the subW
ject?(alluding to the expected report on
J Mr. Benton's resolutions adverse to the assumption
of debts by the States.) It is time
to act; and in my opinion, wo are ut the
point where we were when the American
System was adopted?the revival of which
would be followed by incalculable injury. I
am ready to meet that point, and to show
that the whole system is the reverse ut our
true policy.
Mr. Clay. The gentleman chooses to
#?f?U ?!>;?? r)i.?trihution of the land oro
ceeds) a a assumption of the S ate debts.?
Why, sir, the proposition was made long
before any Sate was in debt, o.*, if any, only
for & trifling sum ; and the gentleman says
this is an assumption of the St.r e debts !?
But how! Ou what grounds did I inuke
my proposition T We are in possess on of
a fund belonging to the States, helJ in trust
solely for their benefit; and { suiJ we ough
now to distribute its proceeds among the
States. And the gentleman says this is an
assumption of the State debts! Sir, h<?w
is it so? And whose i? this property ? It
will go to the States that owe no debt; and
if those States receive it, they get only what
> they are entitled to.
In respect to the American Sys'em, I
am ready to engage in the discussion oil
that subject; but when 1 do so, I hope the
honorable Senator from South Carolina will
remember the part he took in 1816 as the
originator of that system; and that I was
then his humble follower on that subject;
hut when I do so, I hope the honorable
Senator from South Carolina will remain- j
berthe part he took in 13i6 as the orig n
ator of that system ; and that I was then tils
humble follower on that subject and for
years afterwards; and I believe the country
is now fifty years ahead of what it would
have been but for that system; and if it had
not been for that system, we should he now
in the state we were before the Revolution,
when '.here was no paper ar.d no ciurency,
except as tobacco and oher articles of
trade were used as a medium.

Mr. Grundy said, without intending to
declare any opinion on the merits of the
debate in which the gentlemen who preceded
him had engag- d, he expressed the
hope that the subject of the assumption of
State debts by ti c General Government
would not be worn out before it came
properly before the Senate. The Select

A great number of petitions were presented

to au invention to prevent the bursting oi
Steam Boilers, and which from the remarks
made, will furnish an effectual remedy. It
consists in the application of a self acting
Safety Valve, and consists of two valves,?
one opening upwards and the other down,
wards, upon the top of the b >iler, and con- 1
nected with a weight inside the boiler. It is '
founded upon the principle that a body i;n.
mersed in water is lighter than when suspen*.

exactly equal to the weigM of water displaced
by it. Its operation is as follows: When the

because they baiai.ee each other; the

operate to close the inside valve and thus, keep
both firm to their respective seats. The inside
weight thus immersed in water we'ghs
nothing, and therefore does not open the
valves. But when the water in the boiler falls

\Ve noticed some weeks ago the r?-sul'
of the fatal duel between Gen* Leigh Rend
and Col. Augustus Alston, in which the l itter
was killed. On Sunday evening last,
Gen. Read while at ;hc City Hotel, and
about to take his place at the supper table
was assaulted by Willis Alston, the brother
of the deceased who arrived that evening
from Texas, and shot through the body just
above the hips. Alston fired two pistols
at Gen. Read, but the last missed. After
receiving the shot, Gen. Read, armed with
bis cane and a small pocket pistol, pursued
his assailant to the front door of the Hotel,
where he fired, and it is said wounded Alston
ff^he hand. As Gen. R?'ad was falling
in the arms of his friends, and stugg?ring
through the crowd, Alston returned and
stabbed him severely in the abdomen with
a bowie knife, and again fled. Measures
were immediately taken to effect his arrest
but without success. Although Gen. Read's

would seem as if ihe only law known in ihii

j threatening blood shed and murder. In
' vain, with a few ot era of the inferior magistrates
of the county, have our weak tdlorts
been exerted to repress and prevent these
outrages. We have received li tie support
from some officers of the law, and in one instance
could not even procure the service of
a writ to apprehend the violators of the
peace. We have no jail in which to con.
finecrimin ds. Wlvn offenders are indicted,
and, after the law's delay, are convicted,
they cannor be imprisoned. Although
repeated atrocious murders have been com?
m>tted n this district since 1835, no exej

Incidents of the Lexington.?The fob
lowing siories show on how snail a circumstance
our lif< sometimes depends ;
When the Philadelphia morning boafar.
rived on Monday, the 13 li, one of the gentlemen
passengers called a hack, and agreed
v\ith the driver to take him o Eighth street.
Another g- n Innar. being nbou' to get in,
.he fornvr admonished ;he driver that he
must no z'g zag about the citv, bu' go d irt-c
ly to Eighth street. "Yes s.r," said ihe
<!r ver, " 1 will tak'-vou firs; ; i: will not be
out oflh<? way for this gentleman." When
the hack had gone on some distance, the
two gon'leman fell into a conversation, and
ihe s< coni one s ated that he w is on his
way to B.?s'on, and was then going to the
Provid-nee boat. 4* To the Providence
boat, sir !" exclaimed the other ; win', wo
started from the very next pa r to the Providence
boa', arid here this ras tnl nf hackm.in
is taking ycu .?Jbdrney of three miles,
and von will certainly be too Jate. Such
was * la fact ; bu' the gentleman imposed
upon, was out of health, andcoul i not help
himself, and so had to go he round, arid
probably pay for it too, and be made too late
besides, for die L? xii gtott had gone when
the hack returned, and so 'he man's hie was
saved. This story show's Ihe advantage
of being cheat d, and is calculated, not to

One of our citi2'*ns who was very anxious
to go to Bos'on in the boat of Monday eve.
nmg, was, bv a series of apparen ly untoward
circumstance*, prevented from tin'sh..
ing liis business at Piiiladelphia in timM to
return her* on Sa urdnv, and as lie could
not conscientiously travel on Sunday, lie remained
at Philadelphia until Monday. His
Boston trip was accordingly deferred, and
thus i is life was saved. This shows the
advantage of keeping th?* Sabbath.
Another gentlemen had made all hrs ar
rangetnents on the Saturday previous, to
take the bo-it on Monday for S oningtm.
But learning that a cr-ditor who h Id a demand
against hint, was watching h'soppor.
tunity to catch him, and r fleeting thut the
boat would b<? th" place at wlii *h he would
b-* sure to be found, be determined on la*
king the New |] ?ven route, and so bis life
was saved. This shows the udvantage of
being in debt. L'*t no man complain of his

and each one was left to himself. Cap*.

for life or death, They took a h.rge square

around the centre of the bale, to hold on by.
They then passed a rope round each en t
of the bale, ond the other end of the rope a.
round the rail of the boat, ond so gently lo
wered them stives down the bile, and hav.
ing tnk n their position cast off, hauled in

! have buil: a raft of cotton bales, but in the
consternation which then existed, they supposed
that any such craft being discovered
would be instantly overloaded, and that sr

They picked up a piece of board directly
which, beting used as a paddle enabled their
to keep their vessel bead on to the sea, ant
in tli s way ti?oy rode, nearly dry, si'tin<
' face to face, for several hours. Then a se?
heavier thnn the rest, or striking more un
fairly, capsized the bale, and threw both int<

ropes, ond by means of the strap around
they were able to recover their |>osition
They were both wet, however, which mad
a vast difference in the power of the col

North Eastern Boundary Question ?
From a communication to the President fron
the Governor of Ma;ne it appears that twt
rnrl-lnjnioc nf Rritish ha VP taken noS'
...... ^..v.wl. session
of a portion of the territory in dispute
The Senate have adopted a resolution, calling
upon the President for information on this subject.
While this resolution, was under dis
cushion, Mr. Buchanan, Chairman of the Cim
mittee of Foreign Relations, in the course o
some remarks on the subject, threw but the
following significant hints.
Allow me, said Mr. B. to make one genera
remark uefore, I take my seat. 1 am very
apprehensive that we may have serious difficulties
with ike British authorities before the
clo>e of this controversy. \ly earnest desire
is, ther fore, that * ur proceedings may be
marked with such justice, moderation, and
firmness as to ju-tify us in the eyes of al
mankind. A contest must be avoided, if this
be possible consistency with the national honor
; and then, if it should be forced upon us,
we shall be a united People.
Mr. Buchanan, owing to his official, and party
relations would probably be apprised of any
danger to the peace of the country as early
as any one out of the cabinet. The fears ex.
pressed by him of serious difficulties with the
British authorities, before the boundary question
shall be settled, are therefore to be understood
as a semi-official announcement that the
peace of the country is in danger.
Since the above was in ty pe we see that the
President has 6ent to the Senate the correspondence
on the subject between Mr Forsyth
and Mr. Fox, the British Minister. The
difficulty seems to have originated from a report
that the authorities of Maine intended tc
take possession of some part of the disputed
territory, in violatfon of the agreement betweec
the U. S. and British Governments. Thi?
induced the British author.ti"* to send troops
into the country. It is hoped the difference
may still be peaceably settled.
We entertain very great hopes that the ridiculous
extent to which the doctrine of in
ftrucling Senators ts carried by some of the
S ates wi1' work us own euro. Attached,
ouiselves, to the rght of instruc'ton. in the
sense in which that rig.it w as contended for
and used by the Democratic party in former
limes, we are mortified to see the foolish
extremes to which it is pushed by the ,4pat
em" demoerutsof the present day. Wnerc
a State ctrertaiuS a thorough and settled
conviction on any great point of public policy,
and her Senator should differ from his
Sta'e.in his views with regard to that pariicu.
lar measure of policy,the State,in our humble
opinion, may instruct, and the Senutor ought
to obey. But to be instructing Senators
out of their seats, on all the miserable petty
political questions of the day?instructed,
too, by accidental party majorities i. the
Legislature, which majorities may be
changed in six months?is too absurd ! It
is high time for independent statesman to
resist this thing. Lot the Consiitu ion be
placed above the reach of the two penny
pul ticians in the Legi^a tires.

The Alexandria Gazelle, which uttered
the above p iragraph is a highly respectable

right of instructing senators out of their
seats" at all, who may restrict or control
them in the ex tciso of that right f It requires
but little acquaintance with human
nature to know that '*miserable petty political
questions of the day" are the very quessiom
on which such right, or assumed right, i>

JVlulticaulis,
TH E subscriber has for sals a largs number
of Morus Mblticaulis cuttings. In ths
qualities which give valuo for planting, viz:
*" size and maturity or wood, they are believs*
ed not to be surpassed, perhaps not equalled by
'y any othefs fofsale in the United States. This is
>ir | owing to the great distance allowed to plant
ing as well as to suitable soil and good cultivation.
Owing to the present scarcity of money,
and the cofiseqent depression in the prico
of every thing else, they are offered at a very
redi'ced price. Persons wishing to purchase
should apply early because all not engaged
are now offered in a distant market. Bein
sides, if not sold before Spring the price may
?s then be higher. Printed directions for platting
and cultivating will be furnished without
charge to those who purchase.
