SOUTH CAROLINA LEGISLATURE. ^
Reports of the Committee on Federal Re- n
laaons. u>
The Committee on Federal Relations, nE
to whom was referred so much of the pe
Message of his Excellency the Governor, m
No 1, as relates to the election of Prcsisident
of the United States, the construe-! ^
tion of the Constitution, and the future > 0f
arrangements as to the Tariff of duties (j,
on imports, have had the same under con-' f0
sideration, and the subjects may be di- j
vided and considered into the following,!
i - ? P(
ncans: w
1st. The propriety of South Carolina ta
uniting in the election of President and |a
Vice President especially when, by so do- bi
ing, she will give expression to her true n(
principles. n<
2d. The causes which have led to the be
overthrow of the administration of Mr. sv
Van Buren, whose policy and avowed a(
principles of action are in accordance ar
with the doctrines maintained by this dj
State. This head will properly embrace j at
an inquiry into the pecuniary embarrass- J w
ments which have induced the people to! C{
lend a willing ear to those misrepresenta- j pj
tions which have contributed to the sue-, u,
cess of the opposition. The policy and J o
o..natitntmnn1itv of a Bank, chartered by | t|i
the United States. The causes of that j b,
combination of the different elements jn
which united to produce a change of ad-1 Cl
ministration. The discordant character I 6j
of those elemen?s. The security which j 6i
the avowed policy of the administration Sl:
afforded to the peculiar interests and in-1 $
stitutions of the South; and the strange y<
delusion which has distracted so many of
the Southern States, and led them to|t|]
unite and make common cause with par- p]
ties, whose avowed principles are at war cl
with the best interests of the South.? 0f
And lastly, the confident expectation that w
a developement of the inconsistent inter- q
est and views of this coalition, will in the m
end vindicate the wisdom and policy of m
the d jmocratic administration. pr
3d. The growing corruption of our Fe- th
deral Elections. , ci
4th. The Resolutions from Connecticut, ^
relating to a Tariff of Protection. ki

Upon the first matter, your Committee, ,

the Federal Elections, without regard to
the fact, whether the successful candidate 1
agrees with us or not, for candidates can j
always be found, whose principles and ^
character will well merit such an expres ?
sion of approval: and the conduct r:i the ^
State, at the present Session, has . -i.Jra- ^
ted the propriety of such a course. ^
Second. The complicated difficulties sv,
which embarrass our momentary affairs, ^
arise from the pei version of Banks, to fn
purposes wholly incompatible with a pr
sound circulation, and an utter disregard su
to the elementary principles of Banking. jn]
No idea is more fallacious than the belief St
that an abundant circulating medium increases
the real value of property. The js
kindly fruits of the earth and human la- br
bour, bestowed in adapting materials in ni
their original state to the use of man, are tv
the only sources of wealth and trade, or B;
commerce, consist simply in the ex- w
change of them. Barter is rendered ca
more convenient by fixing on some one

perty, exchangeable for eveiy other, and n
this is called money. Gold and silver, Va
have, by general consent, become that it
universal property, so that he who hat- de
it, may exchange it for whatever other go
property he wants. Thus, if a man has fo]
an ox to spare, and wants a horse, he sells tfo
his ox for gold or silver, and then he ex- nc
changes that for a horse. This is trade bj
and the use of money. It is clear then, Si
that money must be itself valuable. It Co
costs labor to procure it. It is useful for to
furniture and the aits. So that money th
only facilitates baiter, by being exchange- ha
ble for all articles. No more money then pi;
is needed, than is sufficient for that purpose,
and to thus facilitate all the ex- of
changes of a community. Wherever a ha
country has more money" than it will noi sv
Ic :>se, if unsuccessful, more than a fourth pe
of the amount embarked in the enter- is
prize. In a word money is only a ma- na
chine to circulate properly, and paper th
costing little or nothing, is a cheaper ma- of
chine, but it always supposes its redenip- th
tion in coin unquestionable. These are th
the ligitimate uses of Banks. They are a
not designed to loan money to govern- pc
ment, and when employed for that pur- th
pose, it is a fraud uj>on the people, and ci<
operates as a forced loan, if it is made in B
bills of the Bank. Money loaned to gov- d(
crnment, represents no property, It is a
expended in gun |x>wder, and leaves, b<
when once used, nothing behind, any p;
more than the powder itself, after it is ol
exploded. But it swells the circulation, oj
and thus depreciates its value, and when bi
carried to a great extent, leads to the a
measure adopted in England, a legalized jn
suspension of specie payments, and a tc
' compulsory tender of Bank promises, in- tc
stead of real actual money. The pre- ^
vailing notion, even among merchants, a]
that Banks are ncccssarv to facilitate ex- ei
changes between the States, especially d
that a United States liank is so necessary, j ci
is a fallacy, which is capable of demon-1 p
stration to those who w;ll forget their pre-' ti
dices, uud submit themselves to the
lidance of reason. First then?Banks
tver have been Ufed, and are intended
deal in exchange between nation and
ition. The quantity of exchange de;nds
on the amount of property transitted,
generally speaking, and bills orinate
with the merchant. If a merchant
Charleston transmits a thousand bales
' Cotton to Liverpool, he has funds to
aw upon, and the importer who owes
r a cargo of English goods, seeks that
II to remit in payment. It is the prosr
duty of a Bank to discount the bills
>ming to maturity, where its own capi1

nd discounts bills, payable in London
jt a bill payable at Charleston, would
)t be discounted at the Bank of England;
;ither should a bill, payable in London,
i discounted in Charleston. It tends to
veil the current of exchange beyond the
:tual transactions on 9th October, 1839
id most of the Banks, South and West
d the same. The statement of the situion
of the Banks on 1st January, 1840,
111 nrrwp that fhis irerifiral SUSDension
m be traced tc a total disregard of the
inciples of safe banking, and the most
ljustifiablc use made of Bank capital.?
11 that day the whole Bank capital of
e Union was $358,442,692, of which
it $33,105,155 was in coin; yet their
imediate liabilities, were, for their eirllation,
$106,968,572, deposites $75,36,
857, making an aggregateof $182,35,429.
It is not astonishing that they
ispend specie payments when they owed
149,660,274, more than their specie:
it the public owed the Banks at that time,
162, 896,522. If the public had paid
ieir debt, the Banks would have had ame
means to have redeemed their circulation
and deposits. But no small part
' this enormous debt due to the Banks,
as for loans to. Governments and to
orporations. who were trying experients,
and individuals who borrowed
oney to buy property on speculation, at
ices swelled out of all proportion by
ese very loans, which augmented the
rculation beyond the exchanges, and
us gave a fictitious value, not by ma*
ng property dear, but money cheap.?
liese ficticious values have given way,
it the notes of the borrowers from the
ank must be paid in specie or its equiva
nt. Hence that pecuniary cmoarrasscnt,
which, by being falsely ascribed
the measures of the General Governent,
enable the old adversaries of Deocracy,
under the new disguise of
rhigs, to delude the debtor portion of
e community into the belief that a
lange of administration would restore
at redundant paper circulation which
relied the nominal price of property,
id enable them to extricate themselves
)m their embarrassments. They are
omised a United States Bank?a meare
which, if it was possible to carry it
to effect, would not fail to bring every
:ate institution and all their debtors, to
imediate bankruptcy. But a short time
necessary to expose this imposition, and
ing down upon its authors the bitter demciations
of its victims. There are but
70 modes of -creating a United States

hich would, if taken from the specie
ipital of the present Banks, about
*3,000,000, effectually destroy their
ility to continue specie payments. The
;xt is by a species of Legislative Galinism,
to resuscitate the old Bank, give
a Federal Charter, and constitute it the
positofcy of the Public Revenue, under
me guarantee to be furnished by its
reign Stockholders, for the safety of
e public njonies. This necessarily sup sesthe
resumption of specie payments
r that Bank, and her control over all
Late Banks. This measure will give the
ntrol of all the Revenue of the Union
the foreign holders of that stock, and
us perpetuate the Federal dynasty who
ive so successfully employed the means
aced in their hands. It would enable the
ealthy capitalists to bring the property
the debtors of the State Banks to the
immer, at depreciated prices, and thus
rell the fortunes of the rich at the ex:nse
of the public. Such an institution
so utterly at variance with the whole
low nnd nrovisions of the Constitution,
at it is to be hoped the Representatives
the people will resist it. It is clear
at the new dynasty must stand or fall on
e Bank question. If there is created
United States Bank, the Inde:ndent
Treasury will be abandoned, and
ic people must at the next election dede
on the justice of its fate. If no such
ank is created, the only alternative is to
jposite the revenue in the State Banks,
measure repudiated fry a majority of
>th the creat Federal and Democratic
irtics, or to continue the veiy measure
* Mr. Van Buren's Administration, in
jpos'tion to which was rallied the celerated
coalition called the Whig party;
proceeding which would at once place
i bold relief the flagrant injustice done
> that statesman. While your Commit?
duly appreciate the value of Banks,
'hen properly conducted, they consider
ay connection between them and Govrnment,
except in the ordinary course of
ealing as customers, of the most sinister
onsequences, and inconsistent with the
urity and independence of both. The
uc objects of Banks should be known.
as on their conduct depend* the future Wei
fare of our whole country, and a righ
understanding of tne subject, will proven
unfounded prejudice on the one side
which may refuse to the public benrfiti
which, property regulated, they caji be
stow; and, on the other hand, ward of
those evils which their abuse has already
spread over our whole country.
The real uses of Banks, 1st. To affort
safe places of deposite for money; 2d
Expeditious and safe means of payments
by checks in lieu of counting, 3d. By re
quiring a similar amount of coin to con
duct exchanges, by dispesding with i
part of their specie, and substituting thei
bills, when ly judicious management, th?
credit of the Bank is preserved unques
tioned. The money thus released, is ac
lively employed as capital, and by tem
porary loans, gives renewed and reiterat
ed activity to trade* The very fact, tha
tliey issue bills exceeding their mone;
capita], requires that their loans shoul
be short, that they may be always read;
to redeem their circulation as fast as i
the round of business it is brought in. 1
Loan Office only lends its actual capita
and as long as the interest is punctual!;
paid, requires no change of investmenl
4. They enable commercial men to ex
tend their dealings beyond their actua
capital. Thus, if a merchant has tei
thousand dollars capital to invest in ai
enterprise, he can 6afely borrow thirt;
thousand dollars, and the Bank can se
curely loan it, if his known character fo
prudence, warrant, that by insurance am
other precautions, he will not loose, i
unsuccessful, more than a fourth of th
amount embarked in the enterprise. In
word, money is only a machine to circu
late property, and paper costing little o
nothing, is a cheaper machine, but it al
ways supposes its redemption in coin un
questionable. These are the legitimat
uses of Banks. They are not designei
to loan money to government, and whei
employed for that purpose, it is a frau*
upon the people, and operates as a force*
loan, if it is made in bills of the Bank.Money
loaned to government represent
no property. It is expended in gun pow
der, and leaves, when once used, nothin,
behind, any more than the powder itsell
after it is exploded. But it swells the cir
eolation, and thus depreciates its value
and when carried to a great extent, lead
to the measure adopted in England, a ie
galized suspension of specie pay men U
and a compulsory lender of Bank promis
es, instead of real actual money. Th
prevailing notion, even among merchants
that Banks are necessary to facilitate ex
changes between the states, espvcialf
that u United States Bank is so necessary
is a fallacy, which is capable of demonstra
lion to those who will forget their preju
dices and submit themselves to the gui
dance of reason, Frst, then?Banks ne
ver have been used, and are not intende*
to deal, in exchange between nation am
nation. The quantity of exchange de

ginate with the merehant. If amerchan
iu Charleston, transmits a thousand bale:
of Cotton to Liverpool, he has funds t<
draw upon, and the importer who owe
for a cargo of English goods, seeks tha
bill to remit in payment: It is the prope
duty of a Bank to discount the bills com
ing to maturity, where its own capital i
located. Thus, the Bank of England dis
connts bills, payable in Charleston, wouh
not be discounted at the Bank of England
neither should a bill, payable in Louden
be discounted in Charleston. It tends t<
swell the current of exchange beyond tbi
actual transactions of trade and introduce
that species of bills termed kites, bj
which two parlies at each end of the line
by drawing and redrawing, use exchang*
as a species of accommodation paper ti
raise money, not to facilitate exchange o
actual products or merchandise. All legi
timate exchange is calculated . upon th<
basis of specie; the ouly money of com
merce. There is no real difference be
' 1 a.-.-- ?r .u:?
tween me sevcrm oiaits ui mio umun
and the sereral countries of the world
who deal together. The value of the billi
of the Bank of England or France, d<
not affect exchanges. It is not necessarj
to the trade between France and England
that the bills df either kingdom should b<
current in the other. They are not so it
fact, and exchanges are not impeded.?
The truth is, Bank paper, not oonverta
ble at will into specie, is no currency a
all, but'is worse than a delusion." If eve
ry State permitted no Bank paper not re
decmable?if suspension was death, as i
ought to be every where, a United Statei
Bank is altogether useless. But even i
United State3 Bank would not make iti
bills redeemable, except at the Brancbei
where they were issued. The formei
Bank, even to avoid this, even in relatioi
to five dollar bills, drew five dollar drafl
on its Blanches, which, of course, became
payable only where accepted' The com
mand of the exchange of the country, gavi
the Bank the opportunity of making bill
of exchange the substitute for local dis
count, thus overburdening the exchange
enhancing the prices, and thus avoidinj
the restrictions on the rate of discounts
and causing the balances of exchange l<
depend, not on the balance of trade
but on the balance of kiteing. When thi
revolution of 1837 took place* millions o
this fictitious exchange was brought t<
light. It is now \\ anted to loan its promis
es to Government; for when Government i
under the necessity * f ! 'rrtiwi-jg, *?hi?'i
ought i:.ti-r to b , xrept un t mpora
ry emergencies. its ow n security, by be
ing taken as an investment, would nut de
; range the currency, and is the legitimati
security for public loan*. The privilege Um
i of having the notes of a United Stales sti
t Bank, wherever redeemable, receivable ho
, for duties, would at once enable it to crip. tri
s pie the State Banks?they in tarn, must hi
- insist on the payment of the four hundred
f millions due them by the people, and in re
1 less than two years, the' bitter fraits of an
Whig experiments would be tasted. So ts
1 far from making money plenty, it would
. reduce the circulation of the State Banks,
, and reduce property to its value under the re
hammer. ac

AITH OF AN INDIAN MOTHER,
The following is an extract from the
iri volume of Mr. Burner oft'8 His to!>'
'
" If a mother lost her babe, she would
)ver it with bark, and envelope it anx'usly
in the softest bever skins. At the
jrial place she would put by its side its
acfle, its beads, and its rattles: and, as
at service of maternal love, would draw
ilk from her bosom in a cup of bark,
id burn it in the fire, that her infant
ight still find nourishment on its solitary
urney to the land of shades. Yet the
;w born babe would be buried, not, as
iual, on a scaffold, but by this way side,
at so its spirit might secretly steal into
ie bosom of some passing matron, and
; born again under happier autpieies."
On burying her daughter, the Oiippea
mother adds, not snow shop, and
>ads, and moccasins only, butj(sad emem
of woman's lot in the wftjernps!)

Suicide?On Sunday evening, the 20th
stant^NfTan whose name, fr.om papers
und in hispossession, is supposed to be
obert B. Hamilton, put an end to his
irly existanee, at the house of James M.
mith, in this village, by hanging himself
ith his pocket handkerchief fastened to ^
e bed post. What conld have induced
m to co limit this rash act, and thus rash
ibidden into the pressence of his Maker,
s has left no clue by which we can as:rtain,
or even conjecture. He came to
e house of Mr. 8mitb on Saturday eveng
in the Southern stage, complained of
dng indisposed, and went to a private
om, where he remained until he tied the
tal noose on the next evening. From
ipers found in his possession, it is supped
he had heretofore resided in Abbelie,
S. C., and that he had recently hern
Spartanburg C. II. He had with him
out $150 in money, and copies of notes
pposed to have been placed in the hands
some person for collection, to the
nountof about $1600, which are in the
inds of Air. Smith.

Presence of jViW.?Napoleon 'was so
rtial to snuff that he used it to excess,
general, supplying his nasal organs
3m his waistcoat pocket. Many reasons
ye been assigned for his adopting* the
icket of his waistcoat as a substitute for f
e article generally used, and as we hare
t met with the following before, we
nture on its insertion.
On the ere of the battle of Waterloo,
Napoleon was ruminating in his tent,
on what might be the erent of the eonct
about to be commenced, he took his
off box off the table and proceeded to
ike use of it, but so familiar was he
ith the quality of its contents that as he
ok a pinch between his finger and thumb
! perceived it felt gritty to the finger insad
of being as usual, though the differce
was not visible to the eye. He iraediatelv,
by way of trying its genuine
ss, gave some to a dog that was lying
the tent. It had an almost inslatntan*
us effect on the animal, and in the end
priveri it of ixistanee* Buonapart's sua.
cion was now confirmed, he saw plain*
that an attempt had been made to poi* .f
n him, but such was the presence of 4
>nd that he took care to let none of the
licers composing his staff kuow of it at
ch a critical time?his only precaution
ing to prevent a like occurrence taking'
ace, was the substitute* of bio waistcoat
>cket for his snuff box.
