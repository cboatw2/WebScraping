llliMl NATURALS.'
Amongst the many very excellent papers
in the Monthly Magazine, is one by M. C.
G rat tan, entitled 'Sketches of Irish Tools.'
To me it was peculiarly interesting, as
bringing :o my remembrance many ancc- j
do es of, and circumstances connected with !
this unhappy, yet in Ireland, highly favored
class of beings. Perhaps a few of my re
collections might be welcome to you, as
forming, * Addenda' to the article to which
I have referred. The Turks, we have j
heard, consider .heir madmen inspired, and
suffer iliein to go about unmolested, but r.o:
uncared fur. t )ne wotild suppose that the
Irish entertain ti.e same feelings, fur as
^ Grottan observes, * Ireland is more fertile
than any other couu'rv in what is generally
called fully.' I confess my belief, that many

who used to haunt our house, our poul ry
yard, our orchard, to the manifest destruction
of our eggs and apples. 11(3 was
known by the sobriquet of 4 Boiled Jack,'
from the fact of las having, in Ids childhood,
fallen into a brewing copper; how
he escaped with life is a marvel, hut his
left arm and the left portion of his face
were woefully distorted: but for this he
would have been a tall, handsome fellow;
as it was, he had something rather comical
than disagreeable in his aspect, and certainly
made his one arm do the business ol
two.
4 Boiled Jack ' was invariably assiduous
i i his attention to the cook, the hen-wife,
the gardener; but to the hen-wife in particular,
constantly assisting her in mixing
the potatoes lor the pou.try-yard, until us
she says, 4the fowls, the cruythurs. were as

however, there was a pcrpe.ua! cry for

continued, day after day, morning after
morning, but no eggs came; the nest was
searched,?the hen-wife scolded,?the pour
woman declared the hens were good for
nothing?1< d and fat liiey were, and yet
they would lay no eggs. This was very
provoking; the cook could make no puddings,
tiltiv was an outcry throughout
the house. W iiat is an Irish house without

In t;ie retired village of Ihdlymitty, there ;!
lived a iKJor widow whose name was Jacob. ' i
Sue v. us decern, sober and industrious 1
much b loved by her neighbors, and universally
respected by the higher orders of :
society. This woman had three sons?
ail "bom Naturals''?'handsome fellows;
ih y were, singularly well made, and finely ,
1 propor.ioucJ, good tempered, gentle, and, 11
what was veiy distressing, painfully alive to
i dicir infirmity. Tney had been sent lo
school, hut had not the power of acquiring j
either i"' ading or writing. One of them j
had a tas e for, or rat liar a love of drawing:
and would set for hours on his moth- !
; er's neatly sanded floor, sketching with a !
j piece of sdel; trees and rivers?but, above j
ail, Angels. Whenevci lis mother wasp
sick, he would draw iior, w ith a monstrous i(
pair of w ings, tliat she might, he said, 4 the
easier fly to God;' indeed, all his ideas!
and f clings were directed heavuiward; iiti
would s;t outside llio doors for hours on a .
inoonligh night, calling the moon, 4 God's
big candle,' and the s.ars, * God's little I
caudle.' Another, the vo ingest, I believe,
was cclebiu'cd all over the country as a j
stoiie-mason ; he had picked lip the bu>i- j
:it ss Without receiving any ins ruction ; and i
wlu never lie could be go; to work would !
do wonders, but uoear.hiy poucr could in.:
ducehim to be industrious lor more than a

i'Ah, all! God bless yer honor; a new

This was all true. ]>nt sorrow cuue upon ;

i Some lime after, there was great cunstcr-'
r,alien in the neighborhood ; lor the sancti-.
1 tv of the grave had been violated?The j
widow's dead body had been stolen. No,
trace of it could be discovered, and thej
occurrence was nearly forgotten, when poor
Larry, who never either sung or worked |
after his mother's death, soon refused food,
1 and took his bed ; and the artist brother was
often occupied in sketching his head, with ,
j huge wings at the back, a sort of prosenti-;
i ment of his death appeared to occupy the j
j inind of this young man, lor, when not j
u rawing, no wouiu sit opposite barry. now

wild ha.lads they used to sing together. Ma*
i ?
uv of the poor n -ighbors, with the cnarac-.
i teristic humanity of their country, used to
: visit and attend to the comfort of the poor
sonemason, who was every where a favor|
ire; at last ho was given over, and theparj
ish priest paid him a visit. ' \ ouV not go;

present ourselves before you, and ask your <
deep and solemn attention to the unhappy 1
condition of thai city winch has hitherto
l)cen the promoter and the indexofour national
prosperity, an J whoso la!l will include
the ruin of thousands in every region of our
territory. We do not tell a fictitious talc
of woe; we have no selfish orparizuu views
to sustain, when we assure you that the
noble- city which we represent, lies pros(rate
in despair, its credit bhgnud, its indust.y
paiahzed, and without a hope beaming
throughthe darkness of the future, unless
th government of our country can be
induced to relinquish the measures to
which we a t ibate our distress. Wc fuiiy c
appreciate the respect winch is due to \
our (Chief Magistrate, and disclaim eve- i
rv intention inconsistent with that feeling; f
but we speak in behalf of a community
which trembles upon the brink of ruin, which i
Jecnis itself an adequate judge of all ques- i
hons connected with the trade and currency \

The propriety of giving to the Collectors j1

From this correspondence it is obvious, j'
low.citizens, that we must abandon alt j'
pe that either the justice of our claims I
the severity of our sufferings will induce '
e Executive to abandon or relax li.c p?;l- i
ir which lias produced such desolating
lects?and it remains tor us to consider | ,
lia: more is to be done in this awful crisis
our affairs,our first duty under hopes |
d distresses which we have endured is j
cherish with religious care the blessings ] J
lich wo yet c.?joy, and which can bo pro- '
cted only by a strict observance o? the ''
ws upon which society depends ior secuv
and happiness. W e do not disguise j'
r opinion that the pages of history record, j!
imerous instances of popular insurrection, 1
c provocation to which was less severe i'
an the evils of which we complain. But \ 1
these cases, die outraged and oppressed '
d no oilier means of redress.
Our case is different, if we can sliced
iu an effort to bring public opinion j
to sympathy with the views which we j
tertain, the Executive wdi abandon the j
iicv which oppresses instead of protect- i
r the people?do not despair because the ^

;; sagacity of the practiced politician Will '
rceue the change in public sentiment l-c- \
re you are aware of its approach. But i'
j effort to produce this change must be j
porous and untiring.. Omit a.l appeals | (
popular prejudice, in wi.ich demagogues j
vo lound their strengtn and their success,

Diistrances to the intelligence and virtue ' 1
the people?tell them that the principle j
on which Mr. Van Buren has umlbriuly |
cd, and uniformly succeeded, is this?
nt the poor na.urally hate the rich, and j
o. o them that if this r l!y te the j
, it is time tna. they s.iouid he con- i
iced of their error?avow our belief tiiat |,
a great majority of cases the possession j
property is the proof of merit; be- j '{
use in a country of free laws and equal \
pits, property, as a general rule, cannot
i acquired without industry, skill and
onomy.

ent bring us to ruin?but there are lew ,
ceptions to the rule that Temperance, ;
,d Industry, and Economy, lead to Prop, j,
tv. Tell them that the perverse and
isiinate adherence of the President to |
3 existing system, after all its dangers and I (
y ors have been developed, arises from j
j b lief that ins bes: chance for populariconsists
in affording nutriment to his ;
rnicious principles?with a firm faith j
xl the many will follow the wise and the ;
od, call upon the men of sound morals, j
intelligence and of industrv throughout, i
3 nation, to forget all the distracting top. 1
; which have agitated if, and unite in de- ,
ice of the insi anions, without which ,
mir.crcial socio v cannot exes'?convince 1
ni that the abundant resources for our i
ppiness and enjoyment, with w h cii a be- ]
juant Providence has blessed our land, j)
nnot be brought into action without the
1 of commerce, and that the security and
Dspoiity ot merchants cannot be sustain, j
without a National Bank. ,
It* they reply that our present Chief Ma. i
urate and his predecessor deny the con.
utionality of a Bank, remind them that
imiltoa was the autnor of the law wiiich
torporated such an institution in 1791,
icn the sages of our revolution, fresh
mi all its struggles, were alive to all the 1
ition whHi a vigilant jealousy could
leach; that \\ aslmigton, tiftcr a careful
consid"ia ion, gave n his approval; l"al
in t o i. s:u!.i:cs, the tiuprcuo Court twve
unanimously allinned liie coustitututionidlty
of a Bank; and ask thorn bv what sanctions
Constitutional law can be sustained,
if the laws of Congress, i.i 1701, approved
by Washington, and in 1S16 approved by
Ma lison, and forty years acquiescence by
the People, are inadequate to its support ?
Convince tiiein, loo, that when you assert
the necessity of National Bank, you are
not under the influence of an uttacament
to any particular institution, but regard
only the public good.
Appeal to our brethren of the South for
their generous co-operation, and promise
llicm that those who believe that the possession
of property is an evidence of merit,
will be tnelusi to interfere uidi property
of any kind?discourage every ciiort to
awaken an excitement; llie bare idea of
which should make every husband ami
father shudder with horror?remembering
tuat it is their peculiar piide tiiat they have
sho w n an early and unceasing care of the
constitution, remind them that the alterations
in our conditio.) since its adoption,
ind the innovations to which it has recently
been exposed, demand the attention
)f every true friend oI his country.
The arbi.rury use of the Veto, the destroying
of hills by neglect to return them
ivithin the prescribed period, the excessive,
f not illegal exercise of the power of refiioval
from ollicc, and the President's assumption
of a control over the Treasury,
ire evils which suggest in the most forcible
iianncr the necessity of maintaining the
consti'.u ion as expounded bv its authors,
md finally, endeavor to give such a direcion
to public opinion, as will inspire the
p.embers of the Cabinet witii the proud
sense of independence which should murk
heir eminent stations, and which should
back them to resist tho usurpation of the ^
President, or to resign office, if their opin- 3
ons upon questions of V;tal importance,
ire disregarded by him, even when a muority
of liis cabinet believes that Ins mcasires
are injurious to the public interest.
We trust that by a strict adherence to a
:;ced founded upon these rccomendations,
md by the exercise of those virtues of
which adversity is an apt inspector, you
will soon be placed in a position from
which you will be able le perceive that the
Dppression which arouses a lice people,
and excites them to new vigilance in the
guardianship ot their rights, is like tho
tempest winch prostrated the lofy tower
md destroys the humble cottage, out purifies
the atmosphere, and gives a new impulse
to the energies of na ure.

Win. A. Lawrence, Secretary.
Tne following are the Resolutions referred
to:
Resolved, That a strict construction of
the act of I $20, the only act which could
lave been referred to in the President's
luswer, was unknown during the administration
of Mr. Monroe and Mr. Adams,
md fn (ionfr;;! .Iiii?L?oo dimmr thr? fircf
seven years of his uuinmistiat.on ; that the
necessity for such construction is not assigned
in the Specie Circular as one of the
reasons for issuing it, and we consider the
distinction mate by the Pres'dent between
:hc notes of so!vent Banks and specie, dei
gnatmg the former as credit, iu be erro.
neous, and at variance with the true interests
of the country.
lit-solved, Tnut we dwell with satisfacion
upon the fact mentioned by the President,
that several of the JS.ates have not
yet chosen R- pretC ita.ivcs, and we trust
that a protecting Providence will direct the
people of those fSta.es to tiie choice of Repicsentativcs
wno hare wisdom to perceive,
and virtue to pursue tlic best interests of the
:ountry.
Resolved, That we \ ielJ our hearty assent
to ti;e preamble ot the act incorporaling
the first Bank of the United States,
ivhicti declares such an lnsjtution to be
'conducive to the successful conducting
0 w.
:ho national finances, and productive of
zonsidernble advantages io trade and indusry
in general."
Resolved, That the interests of thecaciialists,
merchants, manufacturers, mechanics
and industrious ciusses, are dependent
an each other, and any measures of the
government wlucn prostrate the active business
men of die community, will also
Jepnvc i.unes industry of its reward, and
ao call upon ail our iellow c.tizens to unite
with us in removing from power those who
peis st in a system tiiat is destroying the
prosperity of our country.
Resolved, That the chief causes of the
existing distress are die d?-leat ot Air. Ciay's
Land Bill, the rcmovul of the public i epos
ites, the refusal to rcchar.cr die Bai.k of
the United States, and tiic issue of the
Specie Circdlar. The L,und Bill was passed
by the People's Representatives, and
vetoed by the President. The People's
Representatives declared by a solemn resolution,
that the public deposites were safe
in the United Suites Bank; within a few
weeks their a her, the President removed
the public deposttcs. I he People's Representatives
passed a bill rescinding the
Specie Circular: liic Presidoiu destroyed
it by omitting to return it withiii the limitted
time?and in answer to our address,
President Van Buren declares that the Specie
Circular was issued by his predecessor,
Draining all notice of the Secretary of the
Treasury, who is amenable directly to
Congress, and charged by the act creating
his department with the superintendence of
the Finances, and who signed the order,
We therefore
Resolve, That all these circumstances
indicate an in inlhs.'on of monarchal principles
into our system, which demands the
prompt and regular action of every patriot.
