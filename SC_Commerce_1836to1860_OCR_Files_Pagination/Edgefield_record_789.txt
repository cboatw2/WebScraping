GR.EAT CALHmoUN MEF.TaNo ix N. YORK.
The friends of Mr. Calhoun hail a
gracd rally in the Park on Monday evening.
Thc resolutions adopted are admareble.
and will find a respotise in the hearts of
the people through the nhole country.
We are compelled to tefer their publica
iion till Monday. We have, as usual,
tie most conGirtina accounts of the Meet.
ing. The J urnal of Commerce says: "in
point of numbers and respectability, it
may fairly be set clown as one of the most
influentialpolitlcal meetings which had
taken place for some time in this city
About four thousand persons were pre
cIio, a large number of whom, in point of
alcut and influence, may he considered
part of the very elite of the Democratic
iearty."
The Aurora says the numbers were
-variously estimated at from 8 to 15
Jhousand, althogh we have seen smaller
neetings there reported at twenty five
bousaud."
The Plhbian. which seems to be in a
perfect rage with the whole affair. bestows
a column of unmtigated coarseness of Mr.
C:alhoun, his friends and the occasion,
hat proves clearly to our mind that the
Iournal of Cummaerce rust have underra
ed the numbers of the Meeting, and that
ie Aurora is nearer the mark. four
housand people could never.have.put Mr.
Vat Iluren's organ into such a slew of
mnxiety, terrnr and rage. That iaper
ays the Meeting 'nonsisted, at haigh water
nark, if exactly 10y93 persons, and deni

ittle boys, niggers, Vana Buren men and

Of-the proceedling~s and .results of this

In politics a general npathy hias prevnsil
ed since the July electihs. Those elcic
tiuo revealed a greater revolution of ptb
lie senrinsent in lflanisiatta, than could have
been anticipated from the character of the
Joopulaition, and the diversified interests of
the State. The policy of the cotton see
tion has always been free trade, while that
of the sugar districts has fiavored a pro
tective trai, in casequence of the asiheld
it ad'orded to that interest against West
India conpetition. Hut the lam- election-#
have returned an entire delegation to Con.
gress. pledged to t he suplp.rt o frec trade.
The iniquity of the tarilrsysten, and it,
gross oppressions, have even disgusted
those interested in its support, andl the re
sulh of rhe election has been alike credit
able to them and honorable td tihe State.
Attention seems now to be dircted to
the comtug .Presidential canvase. and con.
senuently e friends of the rival candi
dates will soon begi to stir them-elves
with alacrity. A neeting uas held in this
to vn in December last, which is the first
move that has been made here in refer
ence to the l'residency. The object of
the mseeting. while it ivas getting up, was
understood to be for purposcs entirely lo.
cal. aind consequently there w;s but a
meagre attendance dr the populationt
there not being present exrceding fifty
souls. out of a parish em'rucing bet weeni
6 and 900 voters. The paurity of persons
present rendered it politic to forego the
purpose for which it was called ; but the
frieuds of Mr. Vas Bureta happening to
have a majisrity present and determining
to :ake time by tho forelock, turned the
meeting into an expression of preference
for him ior 1h nest Presidency. and ac
cording to the true Van Bures tact es, put
