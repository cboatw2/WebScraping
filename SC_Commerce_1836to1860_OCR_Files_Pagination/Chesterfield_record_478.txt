to show, that unless some of the energetic
character of the "old General ' is
shown bv the present President, our trade
in this part of the world instead of increasing,
must be destroyed by the overpowering
capital of the H. B. Company, our
rights as to the sovereignty over the Oregon
Territory laughed at, and our character

Extba Session ok Congress.?The
Xational Intelligencer has an editorial article
in favor of an extra session. From
the general tone of the article there can
be little doubt that it expresses the views
of the leading Whigs at Washington.?
.Since the appearance of the article however*
the House of Representatives, in Committee
of the Whole, has agreed to the
motion of Mr. Wise to issue 5,000 000 of
Treasury notes more th:tn what may l.o
needed before the 4'h of March, by a majority
of about 30. This sum it is snpjHxseJ.

Dam Sispbvriom >1oain?The U. S ;
Bank of PonfyhdU.a has suspended specie}
payments again; which compelled the banks I
of New Jersey. D law are and Baltimore to
sos,n;nd also. The l?ank3 ol Vi/gima are en ,
(feavoring to continue payments. If they did!
not h"p? to succeed hey would tmtof course,

such numb rs and am mats that it wis compelled

card, promise to collect the debt*, and convert
into cash the assets of the hank for the purpose
of resuming payments in specie at the earliest
practicable moment. Doubts gcem to be enter 1
tained whether it wilJ not be obliged to wind
up forthwith; but it is generally agreed that
it will be able to pay its d bis.
The result Ins, ofcourse, been a panic and
much embarrassment and distress tn tnc commercial
circles. So much for comp- llnig the
banks to resume before they wore prepared
* for it. The virulent warfare of partisan editors
upon the U S B<mk, however, no doubt,
had a principal agency m impairing confidence
in that institution, and thus causing a run
upon it.
To make Laudanum?Colic in Horses.
To make Laudanum, cut up fine, one
ounce of opium; add a pint of proof spirits
?say peach or apple brandy; stop close in
a bottle, and in a week or ten days it will
be fit for use. The books direct the laudanum
to be strained at the end of ten
days. This is not necessary; it will not
be at all injured by standing on the
opium. It will keep a9 long as the bottle
which contains it is well stopped ;?that
is, as long as the spirits would keep without
the opium.
We have so often met with laudanum
of inferior strength in families, that we
advise persons who keep it, as a general
rule to prepare it for themselves ; which
is more economical, as well as safer than

A regular abolition debate has com
O *
i menced in Congress. While the nav^
! pension hill was up, Gen. Thompson o
this State moved an appropriation o
$100,000 to bring the Florida war to j
close bv friendly negotiation: An aboli
: tion simpleton from Ohio, named Gidding
thereupon made a speech, in which h<
, contended that the war was caused am
4
protracted to this time by "negro catcher
! and nt'gro stealers" from Georgia an<
J other states. Messrs. Cocper, Colqui
| and Black from Georgia replied, and Mr
; Adams also made a speech. Messrs
Ilayner, Wise and other southern mem
hers endeavored to arresi the debate, bu
without success. The only prctner waj
of treating such men asGiddings, v.'her

; discussion on the subject of slavery is not

Mr Henry A Wise as a I ader i f the House I
of Representatives und'-r General Harrison's (
administration. It was a queer subject, and
it was treated in a manner equally remarkable.
In the tirst place, as I ain told, he protested

the recommendations of the President. He j
rca I from 'he Constitution that clause which
provides i.a' "the President slnll, from tune
lot ni , recoininend such measures as he shall
judge ni'cessary. ard expedient " Until this i
was done, it was idle, m his opinion, for the
House to d>. bate quest ions of policy not
brought before them for their action.
He referred to Mr. Wise's re narks as dictatorial
to the new President and to the House
and strongly expressed his dissent from his
\iews. That member assumed to he a supporter
of General Harrison and to state what
his |K>lir.y ought to hi?. He disagreed entirely
from him as to the course of policy that General
Harrison would pursue and ought to pursue.
In the course of Mr. A's remarks he adver*

the House, by Air. Wisp, and expressed his
di>sent front them. One was duelling; anotlii
er was slave overeeering, and the third, nulli.
(icatinn.
Mr. Adams sent to the Chair a newspaper
with the remarks of Mr. Wise on the controversy
between Cu t Johnson and Duncan,
wherein Mr. Wise says, "there will be no
1 fight." Mr. Ad uns commented on this, and
represented Mr. Wise as lamenting that the
i duel l.w had been passed and there would be
no figh ing.
Mr. Wise and Mr. Johnson both interrupted
Mr. Adams and called hmi to order. Mr.
Adams w as sustained by ths Chair, and went
un. With the leave, he said in the most
scornful manner, of the House and the profes.
sed duellists, he would proceed, in Iiir remarks,
lie did proceed, and in a manner that defi s
description. The ou'.pourings of sarcasm on
the individuals whom he wished to reach, was
as copious as it was hitter. Toe manner of
' t es|?eak< r, s w? II as his venomous and sting?
it g words t< id, through every sentence as he
wen' along.
' He was resolved, he said, to bring to the
? notice of ?hu committee and of the country the
*uhj ctol duelling at ail hazards, and h- wou'd
tie put down nor dictated to by the duel,
ins. He insisted that some Sou'.hern men
wire in thohib't of loo vbeating the Northen,
inon, because tiiey itie Miu'hern tn"n

H i ""
hoped to see no more dtfol murders in this |
nation. I cannot, said he, shoot a man through J
tlnj heart a.r?d then shod teafs dvof his fate. j.
The constituents of the genikimn applauded j
his duelling, and required it of hirrt, as the!
gent, had stated in a puhhc letter. But his 1
(Mr. dams*) constituent would not justify!
him in fighting a duel.
-Mr. Wise several nines explained, in the
course of this a tack, and with great force. As
to the last idea, he explained that lis consii- j
tuents were opposed to duelling, and thai they ;
had often begged him to avoid it. When ho i
fought it was against their wish, and ho might |
add, his own.
Mr. Adams al-o attacked Afr. Wise as to
his course on abolition petitions, and dwelt
with great emphasis on it. His remarks were
stronger on this point?the suppression ol pe.
tit ons?than I ever heard from him.
Finally, he came to what he considered
as Mr. Wise's nullification, and exulted in the
fact that he had su tai .ed the Admiuistra
lion in its course on that subject.
Mr. Adams declared that lie would not support
such principles. Afr. Wise he said, had i
raised a tri-colored standard and called on the !
House to follow liiin; one color was black, the
emblem of slavery; another was red, the color
of murder; and the third was of pale sickly,
and death. Ike hun, representing nullification.
The atand trd he (Mr. Adatns,) would not follow.
.
Bui it would be idle lor me to attempt even
j to allude to Mr. A.'s points. The speech surI
passes a.ny thing thai the imagination can
forni, not only in regard to personal invective,
but to originality of views questions.
When Mr, Adains had done Mr. Wise
rose and made a reply, remarkable for its
moderation and dignity. He confessed
that he was, at first, irritated by the gcnman's
remarks. Had any young and
vigorous man made so heartless, venomous,
malicicious, and slanderous attack
on him, he would never have replied to
him Acre. But this attack came from a
man venerable for his age, his rank, and
his history. The veneration which he,
Mr. Wise, had for Mr. Adams' father, for
his own public services, and for the renowned
state that gave him birth, would
r^strain him from taking any notice of
this wtQton assault. The gentleman
might b<3 ^ratified by if, hut his friends
here were deep, ^ wounded. One intima*

arm that dareJ it. The gentleman Jia3
obtained a victory, and I hope may enjo> (
it. I leave him poJtfCSiNon of the field. |
Buf, at this moment, I am a happier man
than he is!
Loud applause followed MV. Wife's re.
marks. The Chairman (Mr. Casey)
promptly interfered to preserve order.
Mr. Wise sat down and some dozens of
members rushed to his seat, and congrat.
ulated him warmly on what had passed.
Certainly, Mr. Wise deserves great credit
for the general moderation of his course,
during the last two sessions.
The Committee rose and the House
was adjourned. Mr. W. Cost Johnson, (

Paint tor Metallic Suuf^crs.
The sculing off of paint from metallic ?
surfaces arises generally from the con-1
traction- of the paint, leaving minute
cracks through which moisture penetrates
to the surface, and insinuates itself below
the scale, this may be greatly palliated, j
by heating the paint before applying it, j
and by melting it in a small portion of j
beeswax, which prevents the shrinkage j
and the formation of cracks. A paint is j
much used in India for ornamenting work
which is to be exposed to heat and mois- 1
ture?viz. finely granulated tin, or rather

near 80 years. She was distinguished
for her pious deportment, the pure simplicity
