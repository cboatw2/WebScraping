4p*entor was to be the )>erson to navigate
the machine into action, but 011 sinking it
the first time he declined the service.
Gen. Washington unwilling to relinquish
the object, requested .Major Genera!
Parsons to select a person, in whom he
could confide, voluntarily, to engage in
the enterprise; the latter being well acquainted
with the heroic spirit, the patriotism,
and the firm and steady courage ot
the deceased above mentioned immediately
communicated the plan and the otfer,
which he accepted, observing that his life
was at Gen. Washington's service. After
practicing the machine until he understood
ils powers of balancing and moving
under water, a night was fixed upon for
attomot. Gen. Washington and his as#
?>. Ct
sociatcs in the secret, took their stations
upon the roof of ajhouse in Broadway, anxiously
awaiting the result. Morning
came and no intelligence could be had oi
the intrepid sub-marine navigator, ror
could the boat which attended him. give
ainv account ofhim after oartin<? with him
- " -- [ o
the first part of the night.
While theseanxious sjjcctators were a bout
to give him up as lost, several barg.s
were seen to start sudJcnly from Governor's
Island, (then in possession of the British
hnd proceed towards some object near
the Asia ship of the line?as suddenly they
were seen to put about and steer for the
Island* with springing oars. In two or
minutes an explosion took place, from the
surface of the water, resembling a 'water
spouts which aroused the whole city and
region ; the enemy's ships took the alarm,
signals were rapidly given?:he ships cut
their cables and proceeded to the Hook
with all possible despatch, sweeping their
bottoms with chains, and wilh difficulty
prevented their afrightcd crews from leaping
o?ver board.
^ During this scene of consternation, the
deceased came to the surface, opened the
brass head of his aquatic machine ; rose
and gave a signal for the boat to come to
him, but they could not reach Iiiin, until
lie again descended under water, to avoid
the enemies shot from the Island, who
had discovered him and commenced firming
in his wake. Having forced himself
i
against a strong current under water, until
without the reach of shot, he was taken
in tow and landed at the Battery amidst a
great crowd and reported himself to Gen.
Washington, who expressed his eniire satisfaction,
that the object was effected withtlie
loss of lives. The deceased was unrior
the Asia's bottom more than two hours,
endeavoring to penetrate her copper, but
in vain. JIc frequently came up under

Once he was discovered by the watch on
deck and heard them speculate upon him
but concluded a drifted log had paid them
a visit?he returned to her bottom and examined
it fore and aft, and then proceeded
to some other ships ; but the impossibility
of penetrating their copper, for want of a
resisting power, saved the lives of hundreds.
The longest space of time he could
remain under water was too hours. For

We regret to announce that the lie

the last quarter of a century, has acted

Mr Grundy was horn in Berkley counl
Virginia, on the Hili of September. 1777.
His age was therefore a little upwards of (
years. Il;s father, ar. Englishman by birt
removed to Kentucky about the year 1780,
a period when, to use his own languug
"death was in almost every bush, and eve

his brothers having been soon a'ter murderc
and Ins mother robbed by the Indians.
Mr. Grundy havuig received a ooinnv

'y Strayed from the neighborhood of Dar. j

"Darlington Agricultural Society." This \

certain. If it iccnt for Van Buren, it was
js old enough to know, or to have found out
before this time, that he can't be had, and
therefore on that supposition, which is no
Vj doubt a true one, it ought to have been
RC ! back ho.'r.e !ong ago. If it should chance
to be heard of in anv of tho directions in- [
dicated ftbove, the Farmers' Gazette,;
Camden Journal, or Georgetown Amer-1
ican, will please give timely notice of the j
fact, and thereby prevent its suffering for !
appropriate food. And why should it for
a moment thus sutler, when there is;
enough at home to test its digestive pow- j
crsto their full extent, and that too, with- j
out any necessity of applying its gastric
juice to politics.

If the aforesaid Society should ever be

Discoverv op America before Christopher
Columbus.
In the session of the Royal Society of
Northern Archeology of our city, (Copenhagen)
held last evening, (the 17tli of
May, 1840) Mr. Widdman, one of its
members, read a letter, writen from Rio
Janeiro, by Dr. Lund, in which this learned
Danish geologist announces to the
Socioty an important discovery he has j
just m ide. In an excavation he caused to {
be made in the environs of Bahia, Brazi
he found a fragment of flat stone, covei
ed with runic characters, deeply engravct
but much damaged. Having succeedcc
after long research, in deciphering som
words, which he discovered to belong t
the Iceland language, lie caused the exec
vation to be extended in all directions, an
soon lie discovered the foundations c
houses, in cut stone, which, from the ai
chitectural affinity, strongly resembled th
rains which exist in the Norih of Norway
in Iceland, and upon the Western coa?
of Greenland. He caused a continua
tion of the excavation, for several day?
and finished by finding the statue of th
god Tlior, (God of Thunder, of the ancien
Scandinavians) with all nis attributes, th
hammer, the gauntlets, and Jhe magi
girdle, {meg in giarder.)
The Society charged the Doctor ani
Professor Rafo, author of the celebrate
work, Antiquitates Americans, and wh
has first proved in an authentic mannei
that relations have existed between thi
Island and the North of America, anteric
to the discovery of that part of the worl
by Christopher Columbus; to report upn
the letter of Mr. Lund, and to publish i
in order to call the attention of the savan
upon the interesting discovery of which i
gives an account, and which seems to r<
veal that the ancient people of the Nortl
had not only pushed their maritime voys

that they even there laid firm foundation?

Lectures at Flushing.
We took occasion some months sine
to speak of Flushing at the "Oxford
America," and to judge from appearance
it is rapidly demonstrating tliat it meri
the title. The School of the Rev. E
Muiilendurgh has long been known
I one of the most flourishing and best co
ducted in the United States; and with
| eighteen months two others have bci
opened and are in an equally flourishii
condition. St. Paul's College, under t
charge of I)r. Muiilexburgh numbc
one hundred and ten students; St. Thomi
Hall, under charge of the learned ai
popular Dr. Hawks ono hundred and si
and St. Ann's Hall a female Seminary r
cently established by the Rev. Dr Sciiro
dkr sixty eight!
All of these establishments arc full; ai
considering the number of both sexes
this city whose parents would prefer ha
ing them educated in the country, and
the same time at so short a distance as
enable them to visit them with hut lilt
more delay than if they were in tow
we hazard nothing in predicting that
there were ten instead of three Schor
equally well conducted, they would all I
filled.
I The village of Flushing is one of t!
most flourishing in our vicinity; and wh
is somewhat extraordinary, it has grow
more rapidly within the last three yeni
than at any previous period. A Stear

city twice every day in summer, ai
