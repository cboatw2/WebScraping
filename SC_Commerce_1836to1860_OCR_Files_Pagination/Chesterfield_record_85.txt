due from that public to it of more than 0:10

certain, thanthat the i i I holders m st await the
collection of the bank credits, before they could
receive payments far its bdls. The assignees
arc at length prepared to redeem them (tor
their ultimate payment is certain) I.hough
probably not a dollar would have been paid ::i

as the bills of this. And where, at ties time,

have gone into the hands of keen sighted, fur
reaching speculators, who would nave purchased
them for sum?, thr below their true
value, of their more timorous neighbours.
? - -.11! I 1
These arc t:ie men woo wouuunvu laugnee
in their sleeves, and swelled in their pockets,
by such a measure on the part cf tin; bank,
whilst tlie biir holders themselves would h .vc
been the sore snjierors.
But this is not the worst side of the picture.
The bids of this bank it is well known,
constitute cliicfiv the circulating medium o:
the whole surrounnding coun'rv. Hid the
Bank closed its tioorr, its bills ofjeourse would
no longer, have served the purposes of domestic
exchange, but they would have been
placed on file, by the last purchaser as private
notes of hand, to be recovered at a future day.
And what is there to take the place of tins
currency? Public necessity requires some representative
cf value, bold and Silver have
been established bylaw in tins country,as that
representative; but we have seen that in the
present juncture three are not to be obtained
from any source. Public, convenience has adopted
in the place of these, the negotiable
notes of specie paying banks, lh.t we have
shown that it is equally impassible, to procure
these, because all the banks have suspended
their specie disbursements. There rcrnaim
then, r.o other alternative, il'fhe Public refuse
to interchange the bills of perfectly sou:*. 1 ant
healthy banks, because they do not redeem
in specie, it can Inv. n j representative oj
value, no circulating medium. It follows,
that nothing could be bought, nothing wouki
bo sold, no debts could be paid, because
there would be nothing to buy or to pay with,
and we should be thrown bach again to the
days before the flood.
But even in this emergency, the Bank
might have received S??70,0iK)"o! its debt itits
own bill's, which for this purpose woulf
have been equivalent to coin. But for the
residue of 4o0,00'd it would have got the
lands, slaves and stock of i's debtors, at sue!:
prices as? it migin. see iit to oiler them. JSucli
consequences wo deem the necessary result
of a pubii? determination 1:0' to orchargc
the bills of sound au?l solvent Banks, because
.t I . 1 j
iliev cannoi ior too uiesejr. uo roueuixeu j:j

We can foresee. gciflo'.nen, but two evilthat
can possibly result train t'. s measure.
One'is that tiic Bank may make its specie a
subject of traffic in the market, by sehing it
out to the highest bai lor, and thus abstract
from the vaults a fund' which should be prudently
husbanded, m crucr to < nabie it to resume
its specie payments, as early as jmssi"'ble.
But we think that the Public possesses
v adequate secur-ty against this danger. in tho
H certainty thai the Bank will be sustained in
its refusal to rodeor:, ne Pager thai: the sources
from which the precious rentals can be
obtained, remain closed against them. That
whenever the hanks <.n < lr seaboard .-hoi!
open their treasure:-, this Bank will be compelled
to do likewise, or i.s bills will be refused
admittance into the j ocke's cf our community.
The second is, tint the Bank, fading
itself relieved from the .>-.*!:v of m > t.

THE BANK OF ENGLAND'S SUS. 1
i PENSION' OF SPECIE PAYMENTS,
i.\ 1707.
The present posture of affairs in the j I
| United States will give great in crest to the j
. annexed br cf history of the suspension of (
! specie payments by the l?ank of England, t
i which is from sources to be relied upon: i (
i ,;Ou the *JG h of February, 1707, being j
; Sunday, an older of the privy council was j
transmitted to the bank towards evening* j ]
prohibiting the further payment of specie i j
i until the pleasure of Parliament should be J.
ma<Ie known. The Parliament too!: t!ic j ^
subject into ceusidertion on the next day, j j
February *,!7, and approved of the order of I {

specie payment was originally intended to ]
bo only a temporary measure, and the
strongest assurances were given to this of- j
i feet on the part ot tlic bank and the govern- j
| mcnt. It wasf however, continued from I (
j time to time, but always as a temporary ! (
j measure, until, in 1**10. Tweny-two '
i years sifter trie suspension of pavilions, .
stcpts began serious! v to bo taken for resuming
specie payments, wh'cli were, in fact, |,
resumed, on iiio 1st of May, 162^3. The!,
bank thus presents the &ingu!;;r example of j
a virtual insolvency lor twenty-six years,
i and even:ual redemption of its paper and
i its credit; and this re.urn to specie payments
was not attended by any revulsion or com- !'
I niercial shock; preparations were made
i for it lontj beforehand. The amount of 1
| the notes of tbe bank in circulation was
reduced from about ?24,000,000 to about
! 18,000,000. In the mean time a new
| coinage of g: Id bad been issued, in 18211822,
to theamoun. of ?14,877.547, which
s suppled the country chasm made in the
i circulation of the country by the reduction
; of the nmoun' of Bunk of Mngland noes,
' and also went to replenish the voults of the 1
J bank, in prepartion for the run that might '
j he made ilio resumption of paymen'; but
| the danger was passed v.il'i the greatest

' or, as the phrase was at the time, the price
! of bullion had gradually risin, so as to be
; at one period, at the rate of 14 or 15 per
cent.; and if the bank had then stopped :
j suddenly, and, if we may imagine it pos;
sible, had redeemed the whole of i'S paper !
! .?25,000,000or more, wi:h specie, it would
been again to the then holders of the n<tes?
. in the whole, ?3,5000, 000. and a loss to
the then debtors to the bank of the same
j amount, assuming the depreciation to
j be 14 per cent, while the bank itself would
I have lost only ihe amount of bad debts
; which would have been made by such a
:; sudden and tremendous revulsion; tor the
j moment of the bank's resuming to pay j
j specie itself, by this v -rv operation, it re. j
; (hired tiie payments to lh? bank by i's debt- j
j ors, to specie; for the bank bad a right to i
. demand payment of notes and bills dis- '
: counted in specie, or what would have been j
i equivalent, its own notes. Such a measure j
would evidently have shaken tin* kingdom
! to its foundations, and probably have
| brought down its commercial, financial,
I and economical systems in ruins. Instead
of such a catastrophe, either in discontinuing
or renewing payments, of specie, each
I of which was equally difficult and hazardous,
the transition in tlio dopracitricn of |
paper was gradual, and almost impreccpt- j
j ible, and afier the overthrow of Napoleon,
| its rise in value 4vas again, for the most
j part, as gradual, until it arri ved at a par i n
. with gold, before the rcsurr.p'ion of specie
payments. In a political, financial, and:
coinmsroial view, this institution, from th< I
'suspension to the resumption of specie i
payments presents a stupendous phenome- j
; non, unparalleled in history. The suspen- !
j ston of payments, in 1707, was one of ,
; those l>old measures, which are justified )
j only by extreme cases, are, in fact, the only !
j prudent measures. The whole system of i
j financial administration, and all the com-1
' merciul combinations .and-connexions of j
1 the kingdom, wore involved in the affairs
j of the instittrion at the time of its stopping.
i 11 .1.^ ??,i
j III 1 i'Jl. i iIC llOl'KTS m ill.; u*>iv.a, turn
the doposi'ors, were pressing to tin; bank i
J for specie, of which r!i<?ro remained in the
vaults only ?1.272,000 while the note's and
j claims outstanding, and which might be :
: demanded, were 10.230, and the dc-1
mauds were pouring in with a stiil increas,.
i ingtiJo. I; seemed probable that the bank !
must stop payment after paying out this .
I spoc.e; flie shock, whatever it might be,'
! must be encountered, and it was very justly j
; supposed that it would lx\ in a measure.!
I broken, by anticipating the necessity, and j
j stopping wi n more than a million in its j
i vruits, instead of waiting until they should i
have been cm tied. The reasons given in'
i Parliament in favor of this susspension of I
I payment, and of its continuance from time
j to time, were, 1. that the bank could not,
continue its dic.mnts, and its payments in !
'specie; and, if i*s diseouu's were stopped,
: or greatly reduce I, the commerce of the
j country would be destroyed: 2. that the
1 credit of the Government would bo lost if
i the bank shoukf cease to make advances
j upon its taxes: t>. ihat speck) payment, J
.! were of no benefit to England, as die
specie, on bein^ drawn from :he ban!;, went
| abroad: 4. thai it was more important
: that the bank s!to"M exist. titan that i? j
j should meet its paynn-ts at tee expense of ;
its existence: 0. that th- comnvrelal ari
