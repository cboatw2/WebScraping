POLITICAL. I
From the Edgefield Advertiser.
To Wiiitefield Brooks, Esq.?
Sir:?You will excuse my addressing
you personally, since your letter to Col.
Hammond, published in the last Advertiser,
contains charges exceedingly injurious
to the characters of those to whom
you allude and, until they are named, applying
indiscriminately to all4 in this District'
who arc opposed to that gentleman
in the coming contest for Governor. You
inform Col. II. as a matter of fact, and not
of inference, that his 44 opponents in this
District" are engaged in a 44 systematic effort"
to excite 44 public prejudice and opposition"
to him by 44 false and ungenerous
insinuation," 44 fabricated and circulated
for party effect." As gentlemen are not
in a habit of fabricating and circulating
falsehoods 44 for party effect," or any other
purpose, and as some of those who cannot
support Col. II. happen to be gentlemen,
and many of them his personal friends, I
call upon you, in justice to them, to name
the individuals to whomgyou allude. You
have, of your own accord, publicly made
the charges, and we now demand the specifications
and the proof. As you were
the advocate of Judge Johnson, when you 1
last44 defined your position," and consePrwl
TI'c " nnnnnents in
IJU'vllll^ VI1V V* VVI. M.M. ->
this District." I shall not dispute your
right to speak for those of his "opponents,"
who support "that eminently virtuous citizen
and faithful public servant," whom it i
appears you have now abandoned, though
but a short time since, you would have
been " exceedingly gratified" to see him
transferred to the gubernatorial chair.?
Knowing your great tact in " defining posi- 1
tions" I leave the judges friends in your
hands, hoping that you may succeed in
showing that all of them have been as in- j
nocent of fabricating falsehoods " for par- ]
ty effect," as I know the friends of Col. ,
Richardson are. (
Seeing that you have entirely mis-con- |
ceived the objections, which Col. Richard- (
son's friends have made to Col. H., and
consequently your explanations cannot re- j
move the "public prejudice" which is
against him, I will briefly state the only
grounds upon which, they have ever op- (
posed him either through the public press,
or otherwise. They have said that Col. 1
R. was the candidate of the Democratic 1
Sub-Treasury party?a party formed in ;
1837, when Mr. Van Buren took ground c
for the South, from the scattered elements F
of the Democratic State Rights Party of
1827, and composed of Union men and x
Nullifiers without reference to those old j1
party distinctions?the support of the Sub- c
Treasury and opposition to a National ^
Bank, the Tariff and Internal improve- J
ments being the basis of its organization. c
They claim him as the candidate of the 1
Sub-Treasury party, because he was nomi- c
nated as such by every leading Sub-Trea- a
sury paper in the Sf-ate. It is the pro- l.
vinceof newspaper Editors to propose the .
measures and nominate the candidates that !'
are to be sustained by their party:?how .
else can it be done? The press has, there- 11
fore, been always considered an index to P
the opinions of its party, and a certain J
criterion of its sentiments?it being well v
known that the Editors of leading public ^
journals arc in a habit of continually con- *
suiting with, and being consulted by the ^
leaders of the party. Have you yourself "
not acknowledged this, and did you not r
consider Col. R, the Sub-Treasury candi- P
date when you nominated Judge Johnson,
a Bank and Preston man, against him? If v
not, what did you mean by saying that, t;
from the manner of his nomination, you 0
were "warranted in the conclusion that a
Col. R. was to be the candidate of that ?
portion of the State Rights party, of which ''
the Editor'' (of the Mercury) " is the re- v
ported and recognised organ?"? )
Col. Preston and his followers have rat- j
ted off from the Old State Rights party, '
and are herding with the Bank men, Ta- ]j
riff men, the Federalists and Abolitionists '
of the pforth?they may stillbc considered
by you as a portion of the State Rights ^
? ? ?/inll kn m .->Al?rr?n A * nt> o 5
JJdl lVj uui tftcy tan ui^uiooi> to rr/t?g.?. Be
that as it may, there is certainly but t
one other party in the State?the Sub- 1
Treasury, and of that the Mercury ever ii
has been and still is ,4the reputed und re- t
cognised organ!!" ~ a
Soon after tfiis formal nomination of 1:
Col. R. by the "recognised organs" of our 1
party, Judge Johnson and Col. Hammond "
were brought out by nobody knows who, I:
in the Charleston Courier, (the only Anti- i(
Sub-Teeasury paper in the State) and by 1<
two anonymous writers in the Advertiser, t
- ? . . .. . i . T
Une 01 tnese pieces nas been attriDUtea 10 *
you. Judge Johnson when nominated by c
you, was known to be a Preston and Bank v
man, and Col. Hammond was not known c
tobe politically opposed, and was supposed (
to be personally attached to Col. Preston, t
This, as was natural, excited our suspi- t
fcions, and those suspicions were but con- >
firmed, when, a short time after, some of ?
| <?ol. H.'s supporters attempted to make
him the means of reviving the question of
Nullification. Who is to be benefitted by
the unburying of that forgotten feud, except
Col. Preston, arfdjhose of his fellowel's,
who, by their opposition to the State,
are now in a hopeless minority, and can
only get into a majority by making nullification
the test of political orthodoxy?
Under these circumstances the friends of
Col. R. belie ring with ?/0M,""that he was
the candidate of the Sub-Treasury party,
called on thai party to support him. They
expressed their belief that both Judge J.
and Col. H. were the nominees of the Preston
and Bank faction, that Col. H. was
brought out to divide the Nullifiers, and
Judge J. to divide the Union men, and
that one would be ultimately withdrawn,
and his votes be given to the other. And
it has lately been said, that those who are
opposed to Mr. Calhoun and the present
Administration, finding that they could as
easily elect Col. Preston himself, as his
friend, Judge J., have determined to drop
him and support Col. H. in preference to
i - . r.\ , i i f ! a
tne candidate 01 me party to wnicn mey
are so bitterly opposed.
Now let us examine for a moment, the
grounds upon which those suspicions are
lounded. As you have concluded to abandon
(with your candidate) "the quiet position
of an observer of passing events," and
appear determined to define Col. H.'s position
(if you cannot your own,) you will
not be surprised at my applying to you for
information upon a subject, bearing very
directly upon the point at issue. Do you
know a single Preston and Bank man, in
the State who is not opposed to Col. Richardson?
Can you account for this opposition
to him upon any other ground, than
that he is regarded as the candidate of the
Sub-Treasury party? I should not have
troubled you with these questions had I
not supposed that as the "social intercourse"
with your "old and cherished acquaintance"
(Col. P.) has not been interrupted
by any political differences, you may occasionally
hear from him, and be able to
jive us some information, as to the'course
lis friends are pursuing.
As you appear disposed to drop your
brmer nominee, Judge J. forget his many
' eminent virtues and faithful public services"
upon which you so eloquently dwelt,
,vhen you last "defined your position," we
vill, if you prefer it, discuss the claims
vP ?r/Mi h ni ?s/%f / f/-il T-T \ onrl Kto nAn
'1 YUUI ^CdClll J JUL n.y anu mo wii"
lexion with the "Preston faction." As to
lis connection with that "faction," you
vill not be surprised to learn, I imagine,
hat your espousal of his cause has in the
>pinions of many, but helped "to thicken
ther proofs that do demonstrate thinly."
The conduct of a party is but the conduct
>f the individuals composing it I shall
herefore take a " birdseye" view of your
ourse and draw from it such conclusions
s I may, as to the probable position of .
he rest of Judge J.'s friends at this time.
Lfter feeling sufficiently horrified at the
iea of a candidate for a public office,
ieing nominated in a newspaper, and hav1
g expended as much solemnity and surprise
as was proper on such an occasion, J
ou came to the conclusion that Col. R. ,
ras to be the candidate of the Sub-Trea- ;
ury Party, and proceeded to nominate a ,
'reston and Bank man, against him. And (
vhy? Because "his" (Judge J.'s) " trans- (
2r to the Gubernatorial cnair would have ,
clieved him from the heavy labors of his (
resent office; the duties of which he has
ischarged for upwards of twenty years j
rith honor to himself and signal advan- }
age to the State." Upon the sufficiency ,
>f this reason I shall make no comment ,
s you are no longer supporting him; but
imply inquire if the duties of his office arc ,
ess laborious, or if he has been in the ser- ,
rice of the State a shorter time than when
rou penned the sentence above quoted,
f not why have you deserted him? Is it '
>ecause he cannot be elected, and Col. H. !
vould be more acceptable to Wm. C. |
3rcston than Col. Richardson?
Let us for a momont compare the claims
vhich these two gentlemen have upon the ;
Sub-Treasury party. Col. R. is known
0 be the nominee of that party, and Col.
:I. has been brought out against him, and
s supported by the Preston and Bank
nen. Whilst Col. R. by his open, active i
md effective support of the Sub-Treasury i
tas incurred the opposition of Wm. C.
3reston and all his followers, Col. H's 1
1 oi-tninl mlatirmc" with that trpntlpmnn
OVV/iai lUlUilVdU IKVII ? ? gVUViVUIMM
iave not been changed, and even his opin- 1
ons upon the sub-treasury, were not
:nown till last Thursday. Col. H. if not !
he political, is the personal friend of Col. '
'reston, whilst Col. K. finding that he j
:ould not "maintain the relations of pri- ,
ate friendship, and social intercourse with j
ild and cherished acquaintances, such as
lol. Preston," without some "abatement of 1
levotion to his political creed and compro- i
nise of public duty, determined to split
,vith him even at the risk of a blast of this
rreat "wind instrument" of the Whig Par
ty. - Whilst Col. Richardson is " prepare
to give" '-(as you hoped Col. Hammon
would be!) his cheerful and firm suppoi
to-Mr. Van Buren and the leading mea
&res of the administration'" we find tha
Col. H. only " prefers him to Gen. Harri
son" and is unwilling to pledge himself "t
any indiscriminate support jof his adminis
tration" As a Sub-Treasury man hov
should ydii decide? * *
Upon the score of friendship yotl ar<
also bound to prefer Col. R. Since yoi
have assured us that you have long efiioyec
t - n 1 //>\ 1
ms "connuence ana lnenusnip?con
cede to him "high character,"?"duly ap
preciate his many excellent qualities ane
personal worth"?entertain for him the
"highest personal respect" and " would b<
prepared for more than a quiet acquies
cence in his nomination could you permi
the hind relations of old acquaintance anc
the sentiments of esteem and consylera
tion which it inspired to influence youi
course in the selection of a person for thii
high office." Unless Col. H. has saved you]
life four times, and is in a habit of ex
plaining away your inconsistencies, voi
can scarcely entertain for him kinder feel
ings or be inclined to speak of him ii
more complimentary terms.
You are also stopped from the argu
ment that Col. H. is a Nullifier and shoulc
therefore be preferred, since you admii
that "the organization of old parties nc
longer exists in the States," that "the line:
of seperation have been obliterated, anc
both" (Union men and Nullifiers) "are
harmoniously united in the patriotic efforl
of serving the State"?that "to carry oul
the compromise which was happily effected
in the session of 1834, all public officei
should be open and acceptable to each partt/'
and that the present state of public
opinion and "the true interest of the State'
would render "the elevation of a gentleman
from the ranJts of the Union party tc
the office of Governor" "liberal, wise,pru
dent and magnanimous" To be consistent
you must think that the election ol
Col. Hammond would be illiberal, unvnse
imprudent and contemptible! How then
can you support him? 1 am sure that you
will not act in a manner which even you
rjourself would have to characterise as
illiberal, unwise, imprudent and contemptible.
You feel, you say, that you can "maintain
the relations of private friendship and
social intercourse with old and cherished
acquaintance, such as Col Preston, without
the slightest abatement of devotion to
your political creed, or the least compromise
of public duty." I am either deceived
as to your political creed, or you are,
in supposing that your devotion to Col.
Preston does not interfere with the discharge
of the duties which you owe to
your party. Do you consider it not the
slightest abatement of devotion to your political
creed, or the least compromise of
your public duty" to be made, by Col.
Preston, or his friends in Washington, the
means of circulating, in this District, all
the abuse and billingsgate which Harrison
YV higs may choose to heap upon our party,
Mr. Calhoun, or even our own Representative?
Devotion is a strong word, and yet
you deny even the "slightest abatement"
of it. Do you consider it not the slightest
abatement of devotion to your political
creed, or the least compromise of public
duty" to assert that " South Carolina is in
the leading strings of Mr. Calhoun," when
conversing with Bank men, upon the subject
of the Sub-Treasury? You may have
been convinced by Mr. Calhoun's arguments,
that the Sub-Treasury is "the
oreat measure of deliverance and liberty
to the South." You may be convinced
that we should prefer Mr. Van Burcn to
Gen. Harrison, and that "the true interests
of the State renders the elevation of
a gentleman from the ranks of the Union
party, liberal, wise, prudent and magnanimous?
but the relations of private friendship
and social intercourse with old and
cherished acquaintances, such as Col. Preston"
have, I fear, caused a slight "abate
inent of devotion to your political creed"
and a small, a very small ''compromise of
public duty. SUB-TREASURY.
Public Sentiment.?We are info.med
that at a meeting last Saturday, sixteen
miles below the Village, where there were
about two hundred citizens present, the
people were almost unanimous for the present
Administration, and against Gen.
Harrison. We are also informed that
all the Candidates of this District for the
Legislature were present except one, and
that they were unanimous in their opinions
in favor of Mr. Van Buren for Pre
sident. There were two, out 01 ine tnree
Congressional Candidates, present at the
same meeting, who both made speeches
to the people, and came out decidedly for
Van Buren and against Gen. Harrison.
There is not much prospect of a contest
in this District on the Presidential question
; we believe that the District has
hardly ever been more united on any
political subject,?Green. Mountaineer*
