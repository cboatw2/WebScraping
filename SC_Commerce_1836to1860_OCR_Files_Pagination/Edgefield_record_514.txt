a-ware of the many objections which will be
started against it; such as often frighten the most
sanguine,and generally terminatethe existence
of such periodtcals, before their intrmsic value
is fully made to appear. Knowing all the-in.
conveniences which' must necessarily arise; in
bringing outa work of this nature;. but, having
received assurances from a number of gentle
men, well skilled in the Science of Agriculture,
of their assistance in his undertakin;; behopes
to be enabled to nurse it thriough its infancy,
and by the aid of our enlightened Agriculturists,
he has but little fear that it will eventually reach
maturity.'
. That such a work is wanted, in this section
of our country, none will deny. No Agricul
tural paper is at present published inthis State,
and those publish6d at a distance, aie difficult

COMMERCE.
T:z light that makes our land arise to view
When mind beholds the range which trade runs
through,
Is shed by Commerce, whose increasing sway
Has guided nations since the Earth'syoungday.
How roqe it first? How sprang its form to birth?
Who gave it wide dominion over earth ?
From Heaven it came: He bade its vigor
grow
An aid to science and the planter, too.
Bold-eyed Convenience saw within its-might
The power that wielded, raises lands to light
Which else bad slept in error far away,
Where burns with lengthened lustre, tropic
day.
Soon passions grew, and where the merchants
plied,
Fiends, shaped like men, for goldaid jewels
cried, -
And plunging onward with the tiger's speed,
Seized fast onricheiwhich theydid not'need
Nor learned the virtuous actis to iri iate
Of better men, who met a better fste;:2
Unlike that man* who by his traffic won
Such wealth as moulded would have made a
sun
Who with Tyre's king his fleet sent far abroad,
And unto learning showed the royal road
Who brought the gold whence Ophir's fountain
purled
And with it found him wisest of the world.
Next, Commerce spread through classic Greece
and Rome,
And e'en in Asia found congenial home,
Spread-whide her sails upon the iinerseas,
And on the main dared firsttorcouit the breeze.
Then Florence, Venice, Genoa, tiled, their
power,
By trade its gifts o'er many lands to shower
And German states improved their growing
land -
Byleaguing in the Hanseatic band.
Grext~r' eaughtthf4er-he
halung n eg o
Becoming g orious for all aflertime.
View now her station as she-shines afar,
Like to the splendour of some lustrous star:
And this young land-her offspring and her
child,v
Dn which the light of Commerce last hath
sailed
Mark-how like rivals both now stand apart,
Yet hav.in common, impulses and heart!
Brightlight ornations-Commerce-thou alone
Giv'st wealth to freedom,glory to the throne
Thou rul'st the wave-and long-laid islands
rise, -
To hail thy coming 'neath the bright'ning skies;
The savage looks, and wond'ring at thy sway
Treads with delight his fast undark'ning way:
Ay! every nation hails thee with delight,
When first it sees thy wings unfold in sight
Time adds new vigor to thy growing wing,
And hations bless the blessings thou dost bring.
Advance and prosper! In thy pathway rise,
The arts that soften and that civilize
Science and letters hand and hand with thee,
Wing their swift way o'er many a distant sea,
And Error's clouds and Superstitions dream
Fade from the nationswhere your pinionsglear.
Advance and prosper !-Bec it ours to aid
Your onward progress, till a way be made
O'er icy fields, and sands that flush and glow,
That man in man a friend shall ever know,
So coie connected every distant shore,
The name of stranger shall be heard no more.

REQUIEM.
BY J. 0. PERCIVAL.
Web's " Come yeC Disconsolate."
Low in his narrow house darkly reposing,
Calmly the great and good sinks to his rest.
Though the grave over him dimly ias closing,
Weep not-his dwelling is now with the
blest.
After life's fitful dream, gently reclining
Doves sleep not sonlier, warm in their nest.
Soon a new morning dawns,cheerf'ully shmning.
Soon lhe awakens to live with the blest.
Well hath he done his task, nobly contended,
Firm for his father land battled the foe,
Bright too in peace hath shown-all nowv is
ended ;
Patriot and Hero, here lieth lie low.
Be not disconsolate !-He is ascending;.
Where his Sire welconmea him home to his
love?
Spirits of other days, over him bending, ..
Fondly invije him to join them above.

School for - Indigent Children,on Thomp.
son's Island,- four miles from Boston..
For the first time we lay before ourria
ders a faint resemblaace of stich a'-rin
school in.the United States, as we desire-to
see in our country. The Farmer's Mon&.l
l9 Visitor gives a short history of a saloMI
for the poor, which-the Bostonians have
had in successful operation seveinfears
We are not sure but the wealthy prqld
tors of this school would do well to.hav.
their own sons there as well asthos62: in
reduced circumstances. The acco pot
shows that something can be doe, d-i
therefore we entreat all to read it.
"We have ever been favorable to'schools
in which farming business and mechanical
trades may be united with other objects of
education. Several- years ago,-in the ex
cellent regulations of the -Asylum Tor the
Deaf and Dumb' at Hartford, Conn, we
witnessed-the process of instructioniil
rious kinds of labor. Particularly ivere
we atone time interested in the pdefori
ance with the needle of a young feindfe
from the State of New Hampshire, whod
was both deaf and dumb and blind. It. is
all but inconceivable how any one depri
ved of sight,'of hearing and necessarily of
speech should be instructed to do any thing
In the absence of the grater facultie's the
subordinate senses are .made to supply
their place. The touch -enables the. blind
mute to distinguish not only substanees but
colors-to identify b'oth living beitigs and
inanimate objects: the smell is likewise an
assistant which comeiAn continued aid to
the operations of the mind. Under a
course of careful instruction, the deaf and
the blind are tatght the purposes ad - the
njoyments of life, and the utterly helpless
how to become tbeir-own helpers. To the
deafind dumb atiHaitford, the value of
instruction in ihe different kinds of -labor
by both males ani.females,-has heen.iani
rest in various - drecdotrs. M atrimonial
onhexious ofthetio i-sexes have there
been formed'wheAreboth 'were deaf and
:umb, in which the parties entered on the
business of lif' with all the alacrity and
success of those -who could both hear and
ipeak. .There is a farmer in Merrimack
ounty who manages his concerns with
great prudence and discretion, and who
,as thriven in property, married to-a mute
wvho also acts wellkh part in.the:dram& of
a~f~ris ar hv ~ told ^r
acatiin at Hartford, and wero taught 'ot
>nly tfie rudiments which open to them all
he advantages of language; but the male
svas there instructed in the business of the
arm, and the female in the management
>f household affairs, in the use of the spin
ing wheel and needle, and in the economy
)f the kitchen.
Among the charitable institutions that
re peculiarly characteristic of the city of
oston, where there is a coin mendable zeal
to minister to the wants of every destitute
and afflicted child of Adam, our attention
has been called to the "Farm School for
Indigent Boys," instituted in 1833, for
"t'e education and reformation of boys,
who from the loss of their parents or other
causes, are exposed to extraordinary temp
tation, and are in danger of becoming vi
cious and dangerous, or usele3 members
f society;" and which in 1835 was united
with another charitable institution located
within the city of Boston, fur the purpose
of "relieving, instructing and employing
Indigent Boys" belonging to that town,
which had been in operation more than
twenty years.
For the. purposes of this institution,
Thonipson's, one of the many islands that
beautify Boston harbor,- was purchased at
the price of $6,000, it is four miles from
the city, and from one qluarter, to one mile
and a half from the surrounding shores of
the towvn of Dorchester. It cotutains one
hundred and forty acres of land ; and the
soil, whbich consists of a rich loami, with a
tight subsoil, is well adapted to the raising
of all the grains and vegetables usually
culivated in New'England.
The establishment at Thompson's island
is situated on the highest part of the island,
and commandls an extensive and beautiful
view of the city, its harbor and tho sur
rounding country: the main building is 105
by 36 feet from outside to outside, with a
projection 39 by 25 feet. The dining hall,
school-room and bed room, are 48 by 33
feet each; and the family rooms are about
20 by 17 feet. It is a neat and substan
tial brick edifice: the outside course of
the entire building is laid in Connecticut
cement, and the inside is plastered with
the same.
In the years of 1837 and 1838 the esti
mated annnal produce of the farm was
$4,500; and the expenses incurred in farm
ing operations, exclusive of the hoard and
salary of the superindent, and the board of
hired mer', was~ about $1000: about $1500
each year was realized from the sales o1
produce which wvas not cosumed onth
island.

of a board of Managers; of whom the
President, Vice President, Treasurer and

Beet Paper.-A Mr. Ryan has obtained
a patent in England for making paper of
Beet roots after the juice is extractedl and
crystalized into sugar. The manufactu
rers have commenced with the coarsest
kinds of paper and pasteboard. anid have
not yet attempted any fine writing paper.
But this far their success is comaplete.
Good printing paper is produced out of
what remains after the saccharine matter
is extracted, and they have no doubt that
the same almost worthless pulp will fur
nish the finest kinds of writing paper.

'COURT HOUSE SCENE.
- The following ludicrous scene occurred
the other day in New-Orleans, in the suit
of Mrs. Gen. Gaines, before Judge Bucha
na'u. It is part of the, report of the case
made by the Picayune, and is worth the
reading:
Here an informal discussion was enter
ed into, in consequence of Mr. Peyton pres
sing his right to read t'ne evidence which he
held in his hand; and when this was de
nied him, of giving the substance of that
evidetnce orally, instead of-as he was esi
led on to do by-the Judge-stating wvhat it
was that evidence would go to establish,
if it were ruled by the-Court that it should
go to the jury. . It ended by the Court cal
hong peremptorily on the counsel to d'esist
and follow no further the. course he -had
beeu pursuing, otherwise he would hold
him amenable fora contempt of Court and
a violation of all the rules of practice.
Mr. Peyton said be might have been
guilty of an error, but before:no other tri
bunal would that be construed into a con
tempt of Court. If, however, the right of
effering evidence were denied him-if a
bt-and-bradooa were to be .plar~ed on his
mout..-he would at once w,,hdrnw fromI
the defenca of the caso; and herenpodhh ,
-learne4 gentleman took op his bat
good-day to his fair elinran th
left the Court.
Here General Gaines indMrs
suddenly started fromtheir seats.
.Gen. G.'-" May it please the court,
lady will take charge of the case hersef
she is prepared to do it."
Mrs. G.-(taking the book in har haod
which Mr. Peyton had been preventedfriin
reading)-" Yes, ~1 will proceed with the-'
ease."
The Judge.--" Do you intend to offer
the testimony in that book -as evidence ?"
Mrs. G.-"Yes; part of it."- -
The Judge.-" Welf, then, I cannot e
mit yotr to proceed." -
Mrs. G.-'-Then I thank W 'Goa
can go before the judges of the U. S. Su- -
preme Court, where I will beeheard, ad
where justice will be done me; which!
cannot expect here, .where .I see.such par
tiulity."
The Judge.-"General Gaines,- thisis -
language which I shall not suffer. Deco.
rum must be preserved in ibis court; there 3
are no privileged classes here."
Gin. G.-'-It is not my intention to be
indecorus to the court. I know. myright
and will- maintain them in despite of my
enemies, and despite of Ne'w-Orleans anid
its sixteen -banks."
The Judge,.-"Order must be preservei
in this Court," -
Gen. G.-"Has not your honor acted as
ounsel for the opposite parties in this case
before you were raised to a seat on that
bench-?"
Mrs. G.-"Yes, be was;. and he is 11ow
titting in judgment against us."
The Judge.-"Mrs.-Gaines, I agin 40-f
peat thatI will not set hear and suffers ch
language--as this to be made use of, 116D
by a woman." -
During this singular-discussion, one4f
the officers of the court was sent for irs.
Grimes & Chinn, the associattof Mr. 'yP -
ton for the defence..to take charge of the
ase, but neither of them was fortbcomingv

General Gaines again rose -qnd alluded
o the controversy wbieb closed pirevious
to Mr. Smith's addressing the court. -

Gen. Gaiueze-"I have something o
ay for whichl I hol' myself.responsible to
this Court add. to be worfd. The coun'sel
for'the plaintifs.(Mr. Roselins) -said yese
erday that my remaiks relative-to ond-of
the parties to this suit were impertint.
This I never suffered auy person to tell me -
before, but coming from that gentleman,l
let the language pass from-my ear liki-the
idle wind. Since my wife has been alld
ed to, I insist upon 'her right to be heil."
The Judge.-"I do not deny-her ijht
to address rho Court, but is the evidence
elorsed ?"
Mr. Barton, for the'plaintiffs, argued that
rom the nature of the'pleadings put in by
the defendants the evidence- was itecessa
rily closed.
The Judge then gave his decision on the
points of law at issue between the parties.
Hie-frst ruled that theevidence offered wab-.
inadmissable, except in as far as the repre
sentatives of Ellen O'Brien was concerned,
in whose suit it was originally taken; that
the authority of the plaintiffs to sue as the'
beirs of Daniel Clarke should have been
denied by a special plea, andithat a sub
,equent~ will to that under which the plain
ifls sue must he specially pleaded and
proof ofits being produced given before it
enn he entertained by the Court or offered
as evidence.
Mr. Barton, for the plaintiffs, eddressed
some remarks to the Court, to show that
from the positioni in which -the case-stood
the defendants could offer no evidence, nor'
had' they ay which could be- received by
the Court.
Gen. Gaines then- said, as the evidence
was closed on him, and a i was deserted
bhis counsel; ho would take the case in
hts own hands. If he appeared in the uni
form of a United- States officer it was more
a mark of respect to the Court thani as a'
badge of privilege. -
[Here the Judge explained what ho
meant by " privileged characters."] -
The fact of his wife being in cotur?,-.he .
aid, was no subject for a sneer. -.She waar.
deeply interested in the issue of?this cije,,
and he thought that she, or any well edu
cated lady, or indeed any woman of an in'
elligent mind, was capable of forming ,a
correct opinion of its merits as one of tho.
other sex, and that she could as well un.
derstand it. as she could- the proper. forbe
lows and flounces of hor gown.-.
With the permission of the cour,--RMrs.
Gaines then rose and' read to the ecurtawid
jury several pages of manuscript, beingimn'
elaborate history of her own .alledged
wrongs and the arti~ces and- dovices of.
