The Report concludes in the following words:—|
“In concluding their annual review of the Society’s
missions, the committee remark, that no new feature in
the missionary work, dr remarkable change in the cir
cumstances in which it is prosecuted, has presented it
self to their notice. They acknowledge, with gratitude
to Almighty God, that the same encouraging consider
ations which have stimulated to past exertions, stjll
operate as powerful incentives to fhture effort. Therels'
yet afforded the same proof of the adaptation of the gos
pel, in the hands of evangelical missionaries, to mleel
the spiritual wants of fallen men, and to raise them
from that state of debasement and ruin to which (liey
have been reduced by the various forms of heathenish
superstition and error. And still there are the same
openings for usefulness in heathen countries, arid the
same confidence manifested by barbarous people in the
disinterestedness of Christian missionaries, whitfli so
clearly show that the Lord is preparing the way fir the
further spread of his gospel through the world, and is
thus inviting his people to engage in new and hallowed
enterprise. With this continued encouragement,! irre
fragable evidence is still afforded that the use olf the
divinely-appointed means is as indispensably neebssa^
ry as ever for the conversion of the heathen ; that how-1
ever fervent and continuous may be the prayer o|T the
Church—'Thy kingdom come,’ and however earnest
the spirit of inquiry and desire which may be gracious
ly awakened in the minds of heathen people, ‘the king;
dom of heaven is never actually set up in any country,
until the gospel has been first introduced by those who
have experienced its saving power. Still does the state
of even the older missions convincingly demonstrate that
patient perseverance is requisite to elevate a degraded
and heathen community ; that however powerfully, in
some instances, the Spirit of God may work in con
nexion with the first promulgation of his truth in a
previously benighted land, and however speedily in such
cases a multitude ot people may be turned 'from dark
ness to night, and from the power of Satan unto God;’
still, great care and unceasing application are necessary
to instruct and build up the new converts; to change
the character and pursuits of a people; and to mould
and fashion anew their %ntire social state in harmony
with the spirit and precepts of Christianity. And it
may further be remarked that, however gratifying it is
to acknowledge the increasing liberality of the friends of
the cause, still it is a painful fact that the funds of the
Society are as yet insufficient even to maintain its exist
ing missions in a state of proper efficiency; much less
to enable the committee to enter those ‘great and effec
tual doors’ which invite their approach, and to which
the emissaries of Popery are now earnestly directing
their attention. Cheered, however by the numerous
tokens for good with which they are favoured by the
Great Head of the Church, and sustained by the sympa
thy and support of the friends of the Society, the com
mittee will renew their exertions, and endeavour, by the
furthering blessing of the Most High, to make the
means placed at their disposal advance, to the greatest
possible extent, that gracious work by which God is
pre-eminently glorified, and sinful men are made ‘meet
for the inheritance of the saints in light.’ ”
The meeting was addressed by the Rev. Dr
• Hannah, Sir George Rose, the Rev. Thos. Guthrie
of the Free Church of Scotland, by Dr. Bunting
who presented a draft from Mr. Farmer for £1000;
and one from Isaac Crowther Esq., for £2000; by
the Rev. W. Curling, of the established church,
the Rev. W. B. Boyce, the Rev. Dr. Barth <jf
Wurteinbnrg, ihe Rev. Dr. Waugh of the Irish
Conference, ihe Rev. F. A. West, the right Hoa.
Fox Maule, the Rev. J. Shermav, James Heald
Esq., the Rev. Dr. Newton, Dr. Alder, the Rev.
J. McLean, of Edinburgh, Charles Hindley Esq.,
M. I’, and several oilier gentlemen who merely
moved resolutions of thanks, &c. At the conclu
sion the noble chairman briefly returned thanks
for a laudatory resolution, and Dr. Bunting offered
up a short prayer.
From the reported speeches, we gather the im
pression that a vast deal of spirit and animation,
was exhibited throughout; the addresses were
^ characterized by sturdy common-sense, intersper
sed with many a good hit, rather than a brilliant
and captivating eloquence. A fine spirit of broth
erly love pervaded the meeting. The best soft, of
understanding prevails between the Free Chiirch
of Scotland, and what the report calls, the Weqley
an Church. A kinder tone seemed to obtain be
tween the Establishment and the Wesleyails,
than has been observed of late. The same' re
mark is applicable to the Dissenters. We !hail
with pleasure these indications of a closer union
of spirit and cordiality of affection between jt’ro
testant churches, each keeping meanwhile itspwn
jurisdiction and govcrnment.distinct from the $est.
This, we are satisfied, is the best and truest pni
ty;—which by a judicious moral division of labour,
gets the greatest amount of tfork done for Christ,
and avoids the unwieldy machinery and the spir
itual despotism of a vast centralization of ecclesi
astical government. u
Jesuits in France.—The discussion on the
Jesuits was opened in the French Chamber of
Deputies, by M. Thiers, on Friday. That deputy
introduced the motion of which he had given no
tice, respecting the enforcement of the laws
against religious congregations unauthorized by
the Government, in a speech of considerable elo
quence and ability, lie professed respect and ad
miration for the Roman Catholic Church, but de
nounced the political organization and anti-social
designs of the Jesuits, as dangerous alike to civil
liberty and the best interests of the Church, from
whose bosom they spring. M. Thiers was ably
supported by M. Dupin, while the Jesuits were
very lamely defended. The press speaks approv
ingly of M. Thiers’ motion ; and unless the Gov
ernment gives a more strenuous resistance than is
anticipated, a formal resolution may be ultimately
adopted by the Chamber, calliug upon the Gov
ernment to enforce the laws against the infamous
sectaries of Ignatius Loyola.
Wealth of the Propaganda.—The French
journals state, that the receipts of the Society in
stituted at Lyons for the propagation of the Ro
mish faith, amounted in 1844 to 3,562,0881 ;
France had contributed l,835,029f; Bavaria, 232,
748f; Prussia, 145,060f; Germany, 42,159f;
Great Britain, 237,795f; Ireland, 181,905f; Spain,
10,578f; Russia, 2449f; Sardinia, 267,464; Si
cily, 109,U8f; the United States of America,
6384f; South America 10,247f; Oceanica, 240f;
&c. The Society expended in Oceanica, 503,8
36f; in the United States, l,044,895f; in the
African Missions, 266,069f; in Asia, 997,125f; in
Europe, 547,317f; costs of printing, 256,360f; the
entire expenses of the year amounted to 3,668,762f.
There wee a surplus of 424,308f. in the treasury*
of ihe Society lying over since last year. ■*
Union M. E.. Church.—It is now generally
understood, says the Philadelphia Christian Re
pository, that the Rev. J. P. Durbin will be the
next Pastor, and that he will commence his regu
lar labours in the early part, or by the middle,

THfe TRUE POSITION OP AFFAIRS}—
/THE DUTY OF THE SOUTHERN
/CHURCH.,, . I
' Brother Wighlman,—I have written nothing
for the eye of the public, on the subject of the Ac
tion of the General Conference of 1844, atid
therefore may without affectation ask a place for
this.
In reference to the doctrines held by the North
and South on the subject of slavery, I am entirely
Southern. I have long believed the Church, in
her legislative rights and duties, stood in precisely
the same relation to slavery that she does to the
Tariff; or any other purely political institution.
The members of the Church may, in their civil
relation to national policy, complain, rebuke, peti
tion, or instruct, as wisdom, conscience, or inter
est may direct. But the moment they begin to
make laws to be placed in their statute book, or to
introduce resolutions and pass them, whereby
they inflict injury upon the feelings of the inno
cent, or disabilities upon ministers, by resolving
them guilty for such things, and unworthy for
such reasons, as are protected by the only pub
lished law to which they felt ’and knew theny
selves amenable, that moment they becomb
dangerous both iotho Church and State. And nip
man over whom they can carry the sweep of such
dangerous power and lawless fanaticism, can re
main another day under such legislation and ad
ministration, without degrading himself, and put
ting to hazard the interests of those he represents.
The majority in the last General Conference
did, in the opinion of the South, make that an,
offence, by a declaratory resolution, which was not
such according to the written law of the Church,'
and proceeded to degrade one of the Bishops for
having offended against a law, which was just in
troduced into the Church, and made for the ex
press purpose of declaring that an offence, which
was not so by any fair and natural interpretation
of written ecclesiastical rule in reference to slave
holding ministers. I offer no other proof in sup
port of this allegation, except the single, and un
deniable fact, that if there had been a law making
Bishop Andrew’s connection with slavery an
offence in the eye of such law, the majority would
have reached him through that law, by means of a
trial. But the absence of such a law made it ne
cessary to resolve him guilty.
I have desired, and tried to be a man of peace ;
but I must be honest, when principle is put to haz
ard. I must not only dissent, but protest: duty i
solemn duty, demands it. The act of which wej
complain, and which has led to a Southern or-j
ganization, for the protection of the Southern!
Church, is one so utterly novel, foolish, and dis-j
organ izing in its tendency, that I can hardly keep!
from bespeaking the sympathy of posterity, in be-!
half of the perpetrators of this outrage. I doubt,
not but the time will come when the maledictions
of the Church and State will be poured upon aboj
litionists as having done less good, and more han^
to the negro race, than all the world beside. And
then will many of the deluded conservatives sajj,
when the abolitionists stoned Bishop Andrew, wh
held t'neir clothes. The great sin of the majority
lies not in abolition, or anti slavery opinions, simply
considered, but in the practical mischief thaa.
must, and does arise from the enforcement of these
doctrines upon the civil and ecclesiastical rela
tions of society, so as to excite and enrage the
public mind, and rend, and tear, the Church of God.
I utterly deny in view of the example of ChrUt
and his Apostles, that the Church has any right to
express an opinion in her purely spiritual charac
ter, the only one in which, as a church, she can He
properly known—upon the institution of slavery.
The Presbyterian assembly have set a noble ex
ample for our friends in the North. They hate
simply declared that the Church has no right ko
interfere with slavery, neither with the simple re
lations consequent upon slavery. This is all We
of the South would ever have asked of the North.

GENBRAL INTELLIGENCE.
FOREIGN.
By the arrival of the Great Western at New-York,
and three days after, of the Cambria, at Boston, we
have foreign news down to the 30th May.
The Great Western brought out sixty-five passengers,
the Cambria fifiy-nine.
There was a decline in Cotton consequent upon the
advices received by the Caledonia, showing that the
last crop is likely to exceed even that of 1843, and ren
dering probable an amicable settlement of the Oregon
question. In other respects the commercial intelligence
is decidedly favorable.
A commercial circular, dated Liverpool, May 16th,
announces the publication of an Order in Council al
lowing the admission of United States Sugar at a duty
of 23s 4d, and states that the first sale of Louisiana
Sugar was advertised for the 19th ult. On the other
hand we find the following paragraph in Wilmer &
Smith’s European Times of the 17th:
“ Just as we were going to press, it has been reported
at the Custom House, on what we consider very good
authority, that an order has been received from the
Board of Customs, refusing admission to Louisiana
Sugar at the low duty.”
_Her Majesty’s Visit to the Continent.—-It is repor
ted that her Majesty and Prince Albeit intend visiting
the Continent, and that preparations are in progress to
enable them to take their departure early in August
next. The route spoken of is, first to Belgium and af
terwards to Saxe Gotha. Rumor also asserts that her
Majesty will visit the King of the French after returning
from Germany.
Military Force in Ireland.—The official return of
the military force in Ireland shows that on the lstinst.
there were, Including the Royal Horae and Pool Anil- l
lery, 21,000 men; to which may be added 9000 police,
and the recently embodied out-pensioners that can be
called into active service, if required.
On Sunday, May 4th, four persons rend their recun
tation from tlie Church of Rome, and received the sac
rament according to the rites of the Church of England,
_ig,St. Andrew’s Church, Dublin.
The discussion on the 3d reading of the bill making
a grant to Maynooth (Roman Catholic) College, Ireland,
commenced on the 19th, and occupied most of the sit
ting. - It was then adjourned till the following day.
There was no doubt of its passage. The opposition to
it appeared to have diminished.
The Cotton market remained ns before.
There was a long discussion on the ICth, in the House
of Commons, in regard to manning the Navy. Admi
ral Cockburn, Capt. Berkely and others represented the
number of men on board the first class ships to be too
small. Admiral C. said they were 100 less than em
ployed on board the same class of ships either in France
or America.
* The funds were buoyant, partly in consequence of the
pacific intelligence from America. A regular caterwaul
Appears to have been expected.
t
} Tbb Crop.—The weather is still unseasonably cold,
particularly the nights; vegetation does not, therefore,
niake much progress, and the season must be regnrJed
afe decidedly backward : in every other respect the crops
wear a healthy appearance, but there is little prospect of
tne harvest being an early one. With the exception of
an very poor light soils, and on cold clay lands defectively
drained, the wheat plant generally looks well; whilst all
/kinds of spring-sown corn and pulse—though, as before
remarked, somewhat backward—have come up evenly
and strong; in addition to which, great improvement
has taken place in the appearance of the meadows since
the recent rains. The crops on the ground hold out
promise of sufficient food for both man and beast, should
the weather for bringing them to maturity, and for the
ingathering, prove moderately propitious.
Mexico.—The British frigate Enrydice arrived off
the bar at Balizeon Saturday, and she is now lying at
anchor there. One or two gentlemen who came in this
ship from Vera Cruz, and several of her officers arrived
in town yesterday by the tow boat Star. We have been
furnished with a few items of information from Vera
Cruz of a date as late as the 23d ult.
Regarding the treaty between Texas and Mexico, the
Mexican Government finds itself in a dilemma which
precipitate action might render dangerous. They have
raised a war spirit which they discover they cannot
quell, and which even to conciliate appears to be haz
ardous. Notwithstanding the large majority which the
treaty or the authority to treat, obtained in the Mexican
Congress, having passed the chamber by a vote of 43
to 13, and the Senate by 30 to 6, the measure is exceed
ingly unpopular with the people. The adherents of
Santa Anna, and malcontents of every hue and kind,
encourage all forms of opposition to the existing gov
ernment. Knowing the inability of Mexico to engage
with the United Slates in war, and confident that she
cannot rely upon England for assistance, they represent
to the ignorant multitudes the invasion of this country
at a task of easy accomplishment, and that the British
government only waits the word to join them against us.
The people are therefore madly in favor of war, and the
adoption of any course by the existing government
having a peaceful tendency, will more than probably
result in its overthrow. The friends of Santo Anna
and the opposition generally stimulate this warlike spirit
to the utmost, and one of two things is rendered almost
certain, either that the existing government will declare
war against the United States, nr that a new revolution
will speedily break out and sweep it from existence.
No attempts are made in Mexico to disguise the deep
and active interest which Great Britain takes in every
thing calculated to prevent the effectuation of the annex
ation measure. . It is said that to accomplish her ends
she offers to pay the debts of Texas, and to assume for
Mexico ten millions of her English bonds, guaranteeing
independence to the one, and security from the inroads
of the United States to the other.
Captain Elliott, and the officers of the frigate, who
came up, are stopping at the St. Charles Hotel.
The Texan or English commissioner, 11 whose name
is never heard,” was to leave Vera Cruz on the 23d inst.
for Galveston, in the French brig-of-war Perouse.
Governor Shannon arrived a few days previous to
the sailing of the Eurydice at Vera Cruz, and would
leave in a short time for the United States.
Business in Vera Cruz is very dull. This is attribu
ted almost wholly to the prohibitory tariff regulations
now in force. It is confidently asserted that. Congress
will adopt a new tariff before it adjourns. The neces
sities of the government will require an alteration which
will encourage trade, and bring more money to the
Treasury.—Republican Jeffersonian.
DOMESTIC.
Broke Up in a Row.—The New England Anti-Sla
very Convention, at Boston, terminated its three days’
session on Thursday evening in a grand row, which
was not very creditable to those concerned in it. Par
ker Pillsbury was interrupted in the midst of one of his
most vituperative harangues against the church and cler
gy, by the hooting, stamping, Ac., of the audience; and for
nearly half an hour previous to the extinguishment of
the lights, nothing could be heard distinctly save the
song “High ho, the boatman row," which was sang jn
chorus“by the whole strength of the company.” For a
moment, comparative silence was restored, when the
Rev. Mr. Binney came forward and stated that he had
been charged on the platform with being the cause of
the disturbance, and appealed to the audience to decide
the truth of the charge. A loud shoutof“No!" was raised
from all quarters, and the tumultuous noises were again
resumed and persisted in until the expedient of extin
guishing the lights was resorted to.—N. Y. Sun.
New Line cf Steam Propeller Packet Ships, be
tween New York and Literpool.—We are authorised
to state that the capitalists in Boston are now building
a line of first class ships for freight and passengers, to
run between New York and Liverpool. The first of
these splendid ships, the Massachusetts, is now nearly
finished, and will leave this port for Liverpool, Septem
ber 1, and the other ships will be brought into line as
soon as they can be finished. These packets arc to be
fitted for the purpose of accommodating a large number
of first class and second class cabin and steerage passen
gers. The two latter in a style heretofore unequalled in
comfort or convenience. For strength, durability and
elegance, they will be equal in every respect to our first
class packet ships ; in addition to which they will have
steam power applied, as on board the United Stutes’ ship
Princeton.—N. Y. Cour. &. Enq.
Coleman’s Locomotive Patent.—We noticed some
time since an invention by Mr. Coleman, brother of the
inventor of the iEolian attachment, by means of which
an engine can ascend and descend an inclined plane at
nearly the same speed it can propel itself and train along
a level road. The Philadelphia Ledger says it was
exhibited at the Exchange, in that city, on Tuesday, to
a largo number of gentlemen. A miniature locomotive,
in which the steam was raised by burning spirits of
wine, hauled two cars, on which a man, weighing near
ly 300 lbs., was mounted up nn inclined plane with an
ascent of one foot in six, with the greatest ease and ra
pidity. The locomotive and its load could also remain
stationary on the plane or descend at the pleasure of the
exhibitor. The attachment is elevated above the level
of the driving wheels, and does not interfere with the
running of the engine on the level portion of the road.
Conflict with a Whale—A Man Kille£—Seth
S. Snow was killed instantly by a whale, off Race
Point, Provincetown, last Tuesday, in the following
manner; As soon as the whale was discovered, two
boats, one containing 5 and the other 4 persons, made
in pursuit, and each boat succeeded in fastening their
irons, when the whale turned upon them, and coming
upon one boat head foremast, utterly demolished it, kil
ling instantly Mr. Snow, leaving the others afloat in the
Water. The other boat severed their line, and succeeded
in rescuing the drowning persons, when the whale
made for them also, hut by hard pulling they reached
the shore in safety, the whale following close In their
wake, as far as the depth of water would permit. This
is said to be the first instance in which a whale has at
tacked n boat in this manner upon our shores.
Colt's Battery.—The Secretaries of War and ofthe
Navy, to whom the subject was referred by the last
House of Representatives, have arrived at the conclu
sion that Coil’s sub-marine battery is nothing new ; that
he is entitled to neither praise nor reward ; and that he
has only availed himself of Pulton's stationary torpe
does and Prof. Hare’s galvanic current. It appears
from the communication of tha Secretary of the Navy,
however, that all Mr. Colt’s labours have not been for
nought. He has received from that department over fifteen
thousand dollars on his own account, and over two thou
sand dollars for experiments-amounting in all to upwards
of seventeen thousand dollars.—Balt. Amer.
Mission to Enoland.—The New York Herald says
The last information on this subject is, that it was con
templated by the President to send either Mr. Mason,
of Virginia, now Attorney General, or Mr. Charles J.
Iugersoll, of Philadelphia, Minister to England. This
mission has been offered to Mr. Calhoun, to Mr. Elmore,
and to Mr. Pickens, and by each and all of them it has
been declined. We are somewhat inclined to believe
that Mr. Charles J. Ingersoll will be the individual se
lected. But as yet, nothing certain or positive is known
on the subject.
Cherokee Indians.—Much distress prevails among
the Cherokee Indians, for lack of provisions. The
Cherokee Advocate says,—"Could those to whose
guidance and mercy are commuted the temporal being
and destiny of the Cherokeesf descend for a moment,
from their palaces of ease, and affluence, come into our
midst, and witn ss the destitution and want that have
been brought on many whose only crime was that they
clung too fondly to the land possessed by them, the gift of
God, surely the dispensation #f justice would not lon
ger be withheld.”
Iron Mountain.—We understand from a gentleman
connected with the enterprise, that the iron mountain
company are erecting an immense furnace near the
mountain, and that they expect to get it into full blast
in October next, and that it will be followed up by the
erection of other furnaces and machinery for the purpose
of developing the rich metalic resources of that region.
Such works are calculated to be eminently useful. They
will be especially valuable to that portion of the coun
try, to the State generally.—St. Louis Era, May 22. |
Guano.—The Burlington, N. J. Gazette says,—“We
hear of Guano almost every where round us. Many
persons have used it near Burlington, and everyone
speaks in the highest terms of its fertilizing properties.
Corn mounts up at a rate that puts all barn yard manure
to the blush. The difference in favor of guano grass
can be told by the greatest calf in the township, and gar
den vegetables run up as if they had been galvanized.
We presumes small cargo could be sold in this neigh
borhood, ifthe fancy farmers knew where to obtain it.”
China.—The law heretofore existing in China that
no man once leaving the country should be permitted to
returnon penalty ofdeath, has been rescinded since the
opening oftlie country to Missionaries, and permission
given to all to return if they wish ; and the consequence
is, that many are returning from India, and other coun
tries; some of them, it may be hoped, imbued with the
spirit, as well ns knowledge of Chiistianity.
Dr. Tyno.—We learn from the Philadelphia papers
that the Rev. Dr. Tyno tendered his resignation to the
vestry of the Church of the Epiphany in that city on
Saturday evening last. It was unanimously agreed to;
and he preached his farewell Sermon on Sunday. He
has accepted the offer of the Rectorate of St. George’s
Church in this city, and will preach there on Sunday
next.
. The New Post Office Balance.—The Postmaster
General has selected from a vast number of models, the
balance of Messrs. Stephenson, Howard A Davis, of
Boston. It is as simple ns Fairbanks’ small balance,
very much like it in principle and appearance, and so
graduated as to stand unmoved when a half-ounce letter
is placed upon it, but kicks the beam when a straw is
added to it.
Mexican Indemnity.—We learn from the New
York Journal of Commerce that the Mexican claimants
have appealed to the President for the payments of the
instalments provided for under the general appropria
tion Act of last session, or to state his reasons for with
holding payment.
Teleoraph.—Amos Kendall, the U. S. Journal says
has made arrangements for putting up the Magnetic
Telegraph from Springfield Mass., to Buffalo New
York, and that he entertains the opinion that in a few
days he shall be able to make a contract with the same
individual for the route from Boston to New York.
Chinese Letter.—The big letter, siy feet by three,
from the Emperor of China to the Presidentof the Uni
ted States, arrived here in the Navigator, and was for
warded to Washington.—N. Y. Journal of Commerce.
Lead.—We learn from the Mineral Point Democrat,
that 43,000,000 pounds of lead were shipped from Galena,
during the year 1844 ; and that Mineral Point furnished
one third of the whole. '
