\l the worst shoals, those near the mouth of
Phompson'sCreek, we learn that the water

if the other* lower down. From all wo have

nuch of the works paid for from the pub ic

Massaciiuhhtih ?Tli" state election took
place in *h.i u'ate 1 a?t week; lull return*
have not yet reached us hut Irorn those ro.
reived, it appear* that if Mortoi, the adm in
igtration candidate for Governor has not been
elected over Governor Everett, he has com*
icry near it. From all wurin learn however
:he election seemed to turn upon o'her queaioris
thin national politics. Gov. Everett
,v&4 open y committed *n favor of the "fifteen
jallon law" or the law which prohibits the
iale of ardent spirits in less quantities than 15
jallons. All topers and a large proportion of
rmjter itc drinkers too, of course, opposed his j I
lection; and this question produced mora
txci'ement in many if not moat parta of the I
date than any other. Gov. Everet' was also
ibnoxious to the abolitionists who are numerous
ti i h?^ sta'e; and the most of them are paid to
lave vo'od for Morion. These men, however,
?eini? once associated with the Adin lustration
tarty in a warm contest may , o^8ib!y continjo
to act with 'hern in future elections. Abbot
l/twrcnce is elected to Congre-s from thn
Boston distri-t in the place of Mr. Fletcher
resigned, and Mr Baker, to supply a vacancy
in another district, caused by the death of Mr.
Alvord. The two members elect are Whigs,
as were also their predecessors.
Mississippi Election.?The State Election
took place in M ssissippi early in the present

eight counties ; in these the Whigs have Ion*
7 members and gained 2, compared with the
last election ; making a clear 1>>?h of ft. At

to have the majority in the State.
It will be seen <y a aemi-o.fi-;al article copied
into a precedu g column, from 'he Army

have determined, f >r the present at lea6t, t?
