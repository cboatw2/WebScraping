ITS LITERARY CHARACTER!
Will undergo considerable change, aa the publisher
of the L&eiei' Companion, in order tp show his
appreciation of the public, favor already extended to
hun so liberally, lias secured the aid of
Mas. Amt S. Stephens'
late Editor, of the 'Portland Magazine," and author
of a series of the most beautiful and popular tales
ever presented to an American public. No lady
possessing gre iter variety of talent, or better calculated
to aiu in conducting a ladies magazine, could
have been selected from the galaxy of female genius
which is the glory of our country. In addition to
the powctful talents of Mrs. Stopnens, the proprietor
has seenred a list of contributors, which combined
will render the Ladies' Companion one ol the most
interesting and talented magaziuesof the day.

devoted to the female portion of the community
should be, interesting, useful and instructive.
THE MUSICAL DEPARTMENT
Is under the supervision of Mr. J. Watson, whose
qualifications for the task are tog well known to require
our testimony.
Tim department of the Ladies' Companion, has
evsr commanded a large share of attention, and lias
been looked upon with no little interest by its readers,
and more esp^ially the Ladies, whom the
publisher is in the highest legree anxious to please
It will continue lo be a subject of 'nore than usual
care to him, and to the Professor under whose supervision
it is nlaeed, to make that portion ol the
m affix sine al'otted to music, inoro than cvm deserving
of the countenance of every lover of music. It h-?*
ever been and will continue to be the desire to have
all pieces of music printed correctly and free from
errors. f
THR WORK l.V OENRR \L.
Over every department an equally careful super
vision will be strictlv exercised by the Editors, ..ml
all appropriate expenditures .vill l>e liberally bestowed
as it is the design oftho publisher, with the aid of his
contributors and the a ivice of his friends to mnkc
the Ladies' Companion distinguished f<?r tne beauty
and accuracy of its typography?the variety and
high tone of its literary articles?the qualitv and
value of its music?and the unequalled splendor ol
its pictorial emhtdishments.
It is the deter.: motion of the publisher to use every
means lo maintain the superiority which the Ladies'
Companion has obtained. For four years in
has steadily pursued a course of improvement, mid
he flatters himself that his present facilities are such
as to give the Ladies' Companion eminent advantage*
overall other publications of its character
From the foregoing it will bo perceived that tlie
Ladies' Companion einbrao-s every department within
the range of Belles-f .ettres and the Fine Arts;
and no exertions or expense will l>e de< med toogrrul
to render the work equal to any other extant. The
flattering and general testimonials of nearly every
contcmparary journal in the United States, and in
fact, many on the other side of the Atlantic. nav?
strongly asserted tho Undeniable claims of the La
dies' Comjianion to the support of the public general
ly. There is no work that gives iis read rs such s
great return for their subscript i in.

From his Excellency Gov. White of Louisiana.
New Orleans, Feb. 27, 1837.
Dr. A. Jones?Sir, In reply to your enquiry,
what I think of your improved Cotton Gin, 1 have
to say, that 1 saw it work on Saturday theS&th inst.
and was very much pleased with its performance.
The mere fact of its self-feeding, seems to me to
be a very valuable Improvement; and besides, the
quality of the cotton, ss it comes out of the oro
cess, appeared to me to be better and cleaner than
from the common Gins in use, and that it saves 1
considerably in labor. Respectfully, &c. i
E. D. WHITE.
From Mr J.Compton, a wealthy planter, resident
in the Parish of Rapide, Louisiana. i
Dr. Jones?Dear Sir, I have examined your Pa- 1
tent Cotton Gin, with feeders, <^c. And have !
seen it in operation, and approve OF it so highly, i
that I have taken the liberty of ordering one lor I
my plantation in time for the next crop.
Tours respectfully, J. COMPTON. '

Cotton Broker of New Orleans.
New Orleans, r eb. 28,1837.
Dr. Jones -Dear Sir, in answer to your note of 1
this morning, I will state, that I have carefully examined
your new Patent Cotton Gin, and have
found it far superior to those generally used in this
State it cleans the cotton much better, and gives
it a much better appeaiance. I hope, fur the good
of the country, it may become duly uppreciati d.
Tours sincerely, A. LONGER,
i From Messrs. Forestall, High & Co. Commission
Merchants.
Dr. A. Jones?Dear Sir, we have examined the
sample ot cotton left with us, cleansed by your ,
I Patent Cotton Gin, and also the cotton in its tin- :
cleansed slate, and pronounce the same greatly {
superior to the average samples which have come <
under our observation this or preceding seasons.
Very respectfully, yourob't servants,

Clifton, a planter of Dallas county, all of Ala.
Dr. Jones?Dear Sir, In reply to your inquiry '
concerning your inquiry concerning your m * l'atent
Cotton Gin, we deem it wo less a pleasure . |
than a duty to say to you, emphati ally, that we f
consider it a most decided and valuable improve* s

Mr. Clifton also stated, that if he had not just '

Dr. A J ones?Dear Sir, in reply to your note,!'
accompanied by a specimen of the cotton, ginned
by your Patent Gin. I beg leave to observe, that it
exhibits a decidi d improvement on the usual process
of ginning; delivering the staple uninjured
and free from nap or trash, clean and of good co?
, lor; thereby giving the article an additional value.
These favorable impressions of the advantages of
, your Patent Gin, have been confirmed by subse,
quently witnessing it in operation. The utility of
1 the double cylinders and saving of labor, will be
[ readily perceived and properly ap, rcciated by the
. intelligent planter.

I ry of iny opinion of your Patent Cotton Gin 1
> 1 beg leave to state. that 1 was fifteen years cnga1
god in the cotton factories of Manchester, England,
and during four years of that tinie. 1 was
r foreman in the house of Messrs Lewis, Williams
A. Co., and near five years spinner in the house of
Messrs. Sandford & Gr.ene I have seen your
i. Cotton Gin in operation, and have examined the
cotton ginned by it, and pronounce it better cleansed,
and the staple less injured, than any cotton
that ever came under mv observation. It is completely
ready for the breaker without the aid of the
blower, and would, therefore, save the first process
h in mnnnfacturing the article I consider cotton
cleansed by your Gin, would command from one
e to two cents on the pound more than the average
r crops brought into the Manchester market, and
cleansed by common Gins Yours, very resp'ly.

d 1 have to atate, that I have been engaged in put*
e ting up the Carver Gins for planters on Red River,
e and that I have seen your Gin in operation, and
have examined the quality of the cotton produced
by it; i consider it equal if not superior to the Carver

The Gins ordered will be delivered to the agents,

It is desirable, when planters give orders for Gins,
they should accompany l hem with their views in
regai4|to the arrangement of saws, breasts, brushes,
&e. /it is found they differ in opinion Some
desire saws of larger diameter than others. The
most common site is 9 or 10 inches; but some wish
them 12 inches. Some wish 6 or 6 rows of brushes
on an axle, while others do not want more than 4
at most. Some wish saws with 8 or 9 teeth to the
inch, while others want 10 of 11. With so much
discrepancy, we prefer they should, at the time of
giving orders, turniah a statement of their wishes,
and the inanufacturefers con fulfil them in every
particular. Where it is left to our discretion, we
shall make them on the most modern and approved
plan. An order can be executed, from the time it
is received, in the space of eight or nine weeks
and the Gin in that time placed in the hands of the
factor. .To be in time for the next cron. all orders
ought to be in the hand* of the manufacturers by
the first or middle of May; except for plantations
where they arc late in commencing to pick or gin
cotton.

THE Establishment of the COMMERCIAL
COURIER wns rendered necessary by the inconvenience
to which our citizens have been subjected
for the want of a public channel of communication
which in a commercial community like Camden, is
essentially necessary, and consequently the COURIERS
claim on the public is such as should ensure
a liberal patronage.
The undersigned have epared no trouble or o\pensc
in obtaiuing the best workmen in order t?>
render the Taper nil the advantages that it. will
admit of, and affording satisfaction to its patrons.
In political matters the Courier will take no '
part; the design being to publish a Paper adapted
to the interest of all, which could not be eflccU <1
by its entering into the arena of Politics?it will
be confined principally to such matter-as appertains
to Commerce, Agriculture and Amusement.
The COURIER is published every Saturday
morning at Three Dollars in advance, or Four
Dollars if not paid until the expiration ot the year.
Persons wislitng to become subscribers must address
a letter (tost paid) to
L.M.J03E3.
