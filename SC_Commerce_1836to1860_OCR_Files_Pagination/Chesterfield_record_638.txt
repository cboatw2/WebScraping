raise armies he could build and man na.
vies; he could l?*vv taxes at will, and raiso
any amount of revenue he mi?;ht choose
to demand; and life and death rested on

am said to have been, where is the power
with which I was clothed ? Had I any
armv? any navv? any revenue? any patronage?
in a word, any power whatever?
If I had been a dictator, f think that even
. those who have the moat freely applied
to me the appellation murt ho compelled
to make two ndmisninrts; first, that niv
dicforship has been distinguished by no
cruel executions, stained by no blood, nor
oiled by any art of dishonor; and. in the
second, place I think they must own
(though I do not exactly know what date
mv com rn is ion of dictator b?*nrs?I i-nngine,
however, it must have commenced

the power of a dictator?I ai least voluntarily
surrendered it within a shorter pcriod
than was allotted for the duration of
ithe dictatorship of the Roman Common

New Periodic ii.s.
The American Agriculturist is the
title of a new periodical published in the ;
city of New York, the first number of
which we have received. It is edited by
A. R. Allen* and R. L. Allen, and
published monthly by G^o. A. Peters, at
one dollar per annum: each No. con
taining 3d large and closely printed 8vo
pages. The number published is rich in
ably written and well selected articles,
one of them the commencement of an
Agricultural Tour in England by one of!
the Editors. The editors nre well known j
to the readers of agricultural periodicals J
as able writers, and will, we are sure,
greatly benefit the country by their pres.
ent undertaking:
They intend also issuing a quarterly
Magazine, to contain most of the inter,
esting matter to bo found in foreign works
adapted to American sod and production,
with a more scientific discussion than is
suited to tlie smaller wceklv or monthly
? f
journals.
South Western Farmer is tho title
of another new periodical of which we
have received two numbers. It is published
weekly in Raimond, Mi., hy Mr.
N. Cr. North, who is aided in the edito-1
rial department by Mr. John Jenkins. (
The numbers before u* indicate judgement

The following from the Temperance
Advocate was in tvpe last week, but exeluded
for want of room.
TflP. WASHINGTON TEMPERANCE SQCIR.
i TV.?Wo noticed in our last paper, that
Mr. Carey, a delegate from the Washing
i ton Temperance Society of Baltimore,
i was lecturing in Columbia. We men|
tionsd too, that we have opposed this nnv.
vol movement. But aft.T hearing Mr
j Carev, twice in public, and much oftener
I in priva??, with nn honest desire to form
n correct opinion, and especially, after
witnessing his plan of operations and its |
surprising effects, we ar? obliged to
come out, publicly, and renounce our op.
position.
This is, unquesticnohly, one of the most
surprising benevolent efforts w? have
ever witnessed: whether we. regard it in its
inception, its manner of operation, or its
results. When we reason on the subject
the plan does not even yet seem capable
of producing such wonderful results: yet
its fruits are such, that we dare not oppose
it. It has already accomplished a
great work in Columbia, and prudently
managed, we have no doubt, will yet ac?
compiish a far greater.
We hid no idea, until we heard Mr.
Carey, that a reformed drunkard could
got up before nn enlightened and refiined
assembly, and tell the story of his follv,
and h:s former degradation, without exciting
disgust and we believed that this
disgust would associate tho cause with
the man. Perhaps wo expected . him
to relate bis experience, in a spirit
spirit somewhat allied to boasting. Jttut
when we heard, Mr. Carey modestly nay. j
reluctantly dragging from himself his talc j
of past degradation bi a warning for others?when
he painted, in tbesiinplo colors
of truth, the downward progress, from the
social wine party to the deep degradation
of the confirmed drunkard?his senso of
shame and remorse, and vet his vain ef.
forts to reform-?wo listened as 4o never
expected to listen to such a tale. It was
an experience which every one. even
those who were only moderate drinkers
frit in their inmost son!* to be true: and in- '1
stead of experiencing disgust, wo found the j
unbidden tear start to our eye, and every
feeling of our heart deeply en'iftod in behalf i
of th? speaker, and of the cause he was advocating.
We cannot, therefore, oppose this
plan of operation. It is one that may be
easily run tnto frna'.ici-nn, and thus be made
to injure the Temperance cause. But let it ^
be the odject of the press, and the friends of < good
nr?J??r, to guard it from dangprous ex- j
trcines but at the same time, to use as a new,
unexpected, and most efficient engine for the .
reform i:i?n of intemperate, and the advances ]
jf temperance.
