Mr. Ca.ipbsll, of South Carolina, 1
run and said, thai tiie chairman of the '
Committee of Ways and Moans had based (
his estimate of the probable annual expenses
of the Government for the four (
current years upon the averaga expendi- ,
tares of the four las*, and had put them 1 ,
at lielweun 27 and 2S millions of dollars (
a year, lie had estimated the nett pro i
c; eds to accrue from customs under ex l
isting laws, subject to the reductions still t
to occur Milder the compromise act, at '
less than ten millions of dollars, and sup- (
posed that there would he an annual de- 1
ficiency in the revenue of about eighteen
millions of dollars.
Mr, C was not prepared to hear the ,
honorable chairmri, after having de~
I
nounced tho extravagance of he late Administration,
so soon proceed to adopt h i
average expenses of ti.e Go\erntnent f>r (
tho four last, as a criterion for the four
current years?particularly when it was J (
weli known that, under the late Admin- <
istration, largo a mounts of money had not
onlv been expended in erecting public
buildings and in extinguishing the Indian
title within the States and organized
Territories, hut that millions hail been
swallowed in the vortex of the Florida
war, which, from all appearances must
soon cease to he a source of public expense,
except for the payment of such private
claims as may arise out of its devastations, j
L'*t it, also, be remarked that, including I
t lie prosecution of that war, the expenses !
of the Government for the last year had :
been reduced to between 22 and 23 mil- ,
lions.
Taking, however, the probable drains j
upon the Treasury, which would occur j
from the payment of private claims, from
appropriations for the support and increase
of t'?? ivy, the maintenance of a
lmme squadron, the support of the army,
for fortifications, an ! other expenses, and
we probably cannot safely estimate tlie
expenses of the Government, even under
an economical Administration of its finances,
for the four current ; .is, at
much less than an averap of M,030,
which, if the land distribution bill,
passes the Senate, and upon the supposi-!
tnm tiiat tie chairman is correct in esti. ;
mating the nett annual receipts from j
customs under existing laws, al less than
810,000,will leave an annual deficiency

Mr. C d:d not intend to discuss the
tesfion arising from the comparative admtagcs
of direct taxation, as compared
ith duties upon importations, as a means j
'obtaining revenue, which had been nl- j
ded to this morning by his colleague
Hr. Rhett;] nor did he design to dvell
: length upon the question of the unequal
ica! operation of the Government, tri
ng from inequalities in the collection
id disbursement of the public revenues.
Ithough the process of collecting money
i one section of the country and dis.
irsing it princinallv in another, manisllv
tends at first sight to impoverish j
in section of the country and to enrich
lother?yet these ' disbursements, if
ade exclusively for the promotion of na- 1
onal objects, are perfectly consistent
ith the good of the whole. They are,
all events, incident to our Government;
d although, in the estimation of some,
?v mnv have afforded a good reason for
fusing the adoption of the Constitution,
ev afford no rpason why the compact
?cM : of he adhered to. Although in'
r I v in the collection and disburse*

r which he was held to such severe acmot
by the gentleman from Pennsvlvaa
[Mr. Sergeant,]?it nfFords no good
ason why a sufficient amount of money
o lid not he raised to pay the expenses 1
the Government. No one can suppose
at a government like this can, with a
if regard to the public interest, disburse 1
? revenue in the crnet oroporlion that it
collected. Our fortifications must he '
ton the frontier; our navy yards upon 1
e Atlantic shore ; our interior States re- 1
lire no d fences against a foreign ene- 1
v hut such as are derived from the con- 1
ge and patriotism of our citizens, and j
it few expenditures can legitimately be J
ade among them. All that xve demand '
that the taxing power be not abused ; 5
at the revenues of the Government, (
lether derived from public lands, from 1
rect taxation, or from customs, be placed
a common Treasury, and appropriated I
r the common benefit. We deny your '
rht to make beneficiaries of the*. Spates I

ey have become so for objects within J
tdr own limits, with which you have .
thing to do, and are competent to pro1e
for them from their own resources. *
is an insult to the intelligence of the c
ople to suppose that they can be de- *
ived bv a measure which distributes F
?nev with one hand, when you immedi- a
dv place the other in their pockets to f
slract a larger amount. Do 3fou sup. r
sc that a measure which proposes to f
itribute a portion of the public revenue
on the basis of federal numbers, during c
acknowledged deficiency in the Treas- v
y, can be well received in that section ^
the country where, with less than a x
ird of its federal population, more than ^
o-thirds of the exports of the domestic 1
aducts of the whole Union are produced; &

Something had been said on 'he intricate ?
estioa of where the burden of taxation c
-
j chiefly fulls by duties on importations.?
Mr. C believed that he was the first per.
son whoever, on the floor of Congress, advanced
the proposition that a duty upon
imports operated as a tax upon exports.
[Je had made this point in a speech delivered
by him in the 2lst Congress on the
1 )?h of March, 1830. some weeks before
Mr. McDuffie's celebrated speech, in
which the same doctrine was advanced,
and which had since become so celebrated
under the name of the 40-bn!e theory.
Mr. C alluded to this subject at this time
for the purple of more fully explaining
his views upon it, but before doing so,
he would read the following extract from
his own speech : " Gentlemen may say
that a tax upon imports is a tax exclusivelv
upon the consumer; that consumption,
for the most part, is proportioned to population.
and thernforo lh.it th.? hiir.lonn of
tho tariff are equalized. Sir, I admit that
the burdens of the system are felt by all,
but I deny that they are in an equal degree.
There is not in the science of political
economy a proposition more susc ;p
tible of demons'ration, than that a tax
upon importations operates indirectly as a
tax upon exportation* Some of the
States export to a greater extent than '
others, nnd thus it is that the tariff op. j
crntes unequally. A single example will j
illustrate the proposition. We will sup. j
pose that 10 pounds of cotton would purchase
one yard of wollen cloth ; add 50
per cent, on the yard of woollen cloth for
duty, and it will require Impounds of cotton
to purchase it."
Now, sir, said Mr. CM although it is a
proposition of universal application, that
the more we .eceiveof the productions of
other countries, the more of ours they are
enabled to take in exchange; vet, in aj
large majority of cases,"duties upon irn-1
portations do not fall exclusively upon ex- !
portation9, but are divided between the
producer of the exports, the consumer, |
and the foreign manufacturer or producer j
of the articles imported. The burden falls
upon the exporter to the extent that the
duty checks consumption, and diminishes
the foreign demand for his article bevond
the market that it creates at borne.
It falls upon the consumer to the extent
that it raises the price of the article consumed,
and it falls unon the producer
or manufacturer of the artictle imported
to the extent that it checks its consumption
and throws difficulties in the way
of exchange. Excessive duties also frequent!)'
produce injudicious and excessive
competition among domestic producers
or manufacturers, and thus tend to
the injury of those they were designed to i
benefit.
Bat if duties upon importations oper. |
ate oven to a limited extent as a tax upon
exhortations, (as all must admit that they
do,) is it not obvious that duties which are
unnecessarily high, are, in effect, a viola. <
larion of that provision of the Constitution j
which prescribes that "no duty shall be laid j i
on the exports of any State.'* j i

VETO OF TfIR BANK BILL. ,

Secretary. 1
To the Senate of the United Stater: |
The bill entitled " An act to incoporate
the subscribers to the Fiscal Bank of the ,
lim ed States," which originated in the (
Senate, has been considered by me, with ,
a sincere desire to conform my action in (
regard to it to that of the two Houses of ,
Congress. By the Constitution, ir is |
made my duty either to approve the bill |
i)y signing it, or to return it with my ob- (
lections to the House in which it origina- ,
led. i cannot conscientiously give it my J<
ipproval, and I proceed to discharge the;,
luty required of me by the Constitution, j.
;o give mv reasons for disapproving. (
The power of Congress to create a Nn. >

t; and in the last public declaration ! tl
vhich I made, and that but a short time ; p
iufnro In't* PrpSTtiJnfial r?l?/?tirtn I po. I it
erred to my previously expressed opinions tl
i being those then entertained by me. o
-Vith a full knowledge of the - pinions thus r<
nterteined, and never concealed, I was c
lected by the People Vice President of s<
he United States. Bv the occurence of o
. contingency provided for by the Consti- S
ution, and arising under an impressive J
lispensation of Providence, I succeeded w
o the Presidential office. Before enter- hi
rig upon the duties of th it office, I took t:
n oath that I would " preserve, protect. tl
nd defend the Constitution of the United 01
Hates." Entertaining the opinion allu- tl
ed, to and having taken this oath, the b
lenate and the country will see that I di
ould riot giyemy sanction to a mrasure a
of the character described without surren- \
dering all clnim tort he respect of honora-1 <
hie men?all confidence on the part of the |
People?all regard for nigral and religious 11
obligations: without an observance of j c
which no Governsnent can be prosperous, j i
and no Peonle can be h'inpv. It wrould , (
, . . .-LI . . i .
oe to commit a crime wnicn i would nor j?
willfully commit to gain any earthly re-1 i
ward, and which tyould justly subject me ; r
to the ridicule and scorn of all virtuous;/
men. j J
I deem it unnecessary at this time to c
enter upon the reasons which have; i
brought my mind to the convictions I feel 11
and entertain on this subject. They j i
have been over and over again repeated. J t
[fsome of those a ho have preceded me > s
in this high office have entertained and I ft
avowed different opinions, I yield nil con- \J
fidence that their convictions were sin- j p
cere. I claim only to have the same j t
measure meted out to myself. Without ; p
#oing farther into the argument, I will ? n
say that, in looking to the powers of this ! t
Government to collect, safely keep, and : o
disburse the public revenue, and inciden- tl
tally to regulate the commerce and ex- I
changes, I have not been able to satisfy j s|
myself that the establishment by this Gov. 11<
eminent of a bank of discount, in the or- i 1
dinary acceptation of that tenn, was a ne- ci
cessary means, or one demanded by pro-1 b
prietv, to cxcute those powers. What i tl
can the local discounts of the bank have j c
to do with the collecting, safe-keeping, | ti
and disbursing of the revenue ? So far as a
the mere discounting of paper is concern- j v
ed, it is quite immaterial to this question ! h
whether the discount is obtained at a; k
Slate bank or u IJnitfd Slates Rank, j si

modation. Waat influence have local i h
discounts, grantor! by any form; b
of l?ank, in the regulating of the tl
currency and the exchanges? Let the tl
history of the lute United States Bank aid a
us in answering this inquiry. tl
For several years after the establish- p
ment of that institution it dealt exclusive, j
Iv in local discounts, and during that per- b
iod the country was, for the most part. j o
disappointed in the consequences unticipr. p
ted from its incorporation. A uniform ?e.
currency was not provided/ exchanges-a;
were not regulated, and little or noihing'b
. .
was added to the general circulation : ard a
in 1820 its embarrassments had become ! t
so great thai the !:rectors petitioned Con-!
gross to -?j>c?l thnt arti'vt of the charac- m
tor which made its notes receivable everv v<
where in payment of the o ibhc dues. It ! bt
had up to that period dealt to but a very ! as
small extent in exchanges, eith.tr foreign ' th
or domestic ; and as late as 1823 its optr- ' re
tions in that lime amounted to a little la?
more than 83,000 00!) per an turn. A i pc
very rapid augmentation soon after occur-1 sti
