Washington, Sept. 20, 1841.
Gentlemen : Doubts have been at.
tempted to be cast upon the correctness
of Mr. Ewing's statement in relation to
the part taken by the President in getting
up the Fiscal Corporation Bill, by arguing
that there was an impropriety in
making it which ought to deprive it of
credit. There are circumstances in this
case distinguishing it from all others that
1 recollect of the kind. It grows out of a
matter of official business transacted between
high public functionaries, and is of
public and general concern. The public
and open conduct of one of these high
functionaries is in direct opposition to >
what the othor had, by his express direc- I
lion and authority, affirmed as to his in.
tentions and purposes. There can, Y
htimblv submit, be no serious question in
such a case upon the point of personal
propriety, when the injured seeks to vindicate
his nonor by disclosing t e truth.
The obligations arising out of confidential
relations, in private or public affairs, arc
founded in mutual trust. He that disregards
his own confidential pledges and
engagements cannot allege the obligation
of confidence, in the same transaction,
against the natural right of self-cefence
belonging to the injured party. For any
thing that can ever be known to the contrary.
it may havo been the object of the ,
original pledge or engagement to sacrifice
those who trusted and were misled by it. |
Fur these reasons, I do not hesitate to ;
furnish, for publication, the accompany- j
ir.g statement, which contains all the j
facts and circumttances within mv !
t . j
knowledge, that occur to me as being!
material, connected with the subject of!
difference. I do this as an act ofjust.ee
not to Mr. Ewing, who requested it, hut
to myself and the Public.
I avail myself of this occasion to say !
that I have, at no time, regarded a dif- j
ference of opinion between the President !
and myself in relation to a Bank, however
important the subject, as snHicient of j
itself to justify a resignation of the office I
which 1 lately held in the Executive Ad- !
ministration of the Government. Nor!
was it because the President thought pro- j j
jicr to trifle with or mislead his Cabinet, 1
us there is hut too much reason to believe
lie intended to do, in the affair of the las* f
Fiscal Bank Bill, that I resigned mv
place. There were other, and some of
them pre-existing causes, for such a course
which many will regards as sufficient of
themselves; and which could not have
been overlooked. But it was |iossihle to
explain or remove them, and therefore
tl?ey were not promptly acted upon.?
The last act of the President, however, j
was conclusive of the true character 01
ail the other occurrences or circumstances
which had previously awakened curiosity
or excited distrust.
I shall, at my leisure, state the reasons '
more at large which impelled me to the j
course I have thought proper to adopt, I
and at the same time furnish a narrative
of all the causes, so far as they fell under
my eliscrvution, which have resulted in
the separation of Mr. Tyler from the party
which brought him into power, and the 1
freaking of the Whig Administration.
I uin, respectfully, your oltediant scr* |
vnnt,
JOHN BELL.
Messrs. Gales & Seaton.
1 called to see the President on official
falsities* 011 (he morning (Monday* 16th
August) before the first Veto Message
whs sent in. I found him reading the
Message to the Secretary of the Treasury.
He did me the honor to read the mateterial
passages to me. Upon reading
' that part of it which treats of the superior
importance and va*ue of the business
done by the late Hank of the United
States in furnishing exchanges netweeri
the different States and sections of the
Union I was so strongly impressed with
idea that he meant to intimate that he
would have no objection to a bank which
ftJwiiild he restricted to dealimr in ex
changes, that I interrupted him in the
reading, and asked if I was to understand,
by what he had just read, that be wus
prepared to give his assent to a hank in
the District of Columbia, with offices or
ogencies in the States, having the privilege,
without their assent, to deal in exchanges
between them, and in foreign
bills. He promptly replied that he thought
experience had shown the necessity of
such a power in the Government. I
could not restrain the immediate expression
of my gratification upon hearing this
avowal. I said to the President at once,
tfhat what I had feared would lead to fatal
dissensions among our friends, I now re.
yarded as rattier fortunate than otherwise
; that his veto of the hill (hen before
hkn would lead to the adoption of a much
better one. I also congratulated him
iijton the happy circumstance or the delay
which had taken place in sending in his
Veto Message. The heat and violence
< which right have been expected if the
Veto had been senl in immeciatcly upon
th&llA&sage of the bill, would now he
nvoioed. Time had been given for cool
reflection, and as the Message did not ex0
' ?
elude the idea of a bank in some form, no
unpleasant consequences would l>e likely
to follow. He expressed his great surprise
that there should he so much excitonaent
upon the subject ; said that he
* had had hie mind made up on the hill beforfe
him from the first, but had delayed
hia Message thv.t there should l?e time for
the excitement to wear off; that nothing 1
??????????1
could be more easy than to pass a bill
which would answer all necessary purposes
: that it could be done in three davs.
The next day, having occasion to see the
President again, he requested me to furnish
him with such information as the
War Department afforded of the embar.
rassmcnts attending the transfer and disbursement
of the public revenue to dis.
tant points on the frontier, in Florida,
&c. He at the same time requested me
to draw up a brief statement of my views
upon the subject, showing the practical
advantages and necessity of such a fiscal
institution as he had thought of proposing
Such information as I could hastily collect
from the heads of the principal disbursing
bureaus of the Department I handed
to him on the evening of the same
day, knowing that time was of the utmost
importance in the state in which the
question then was. He received the
statements I gave him with manifest indifference,
and alarmed rne by remarking
that he began to doubt whether he would
give his assent (as I understood him) to
any hank.
The next day (Wednesday, 18th August)
was the stated time for the weekly
meeting of the Cabinet with the President.
Mr. Webster, Mr. Ewing, and
myself, went at ten o'clock in the morning,
and were informed that the President
was engaged with Messrs. Berrien,
Sergeant, and. 1 think, Mr. Dawson, of
fw.Arwia. We waited until thev retired
and the President made his appearance
about three quarters of an hour afterwards.
Mr. Badger come in soon after the President
joined us. Messrs. Crittenden and
(i ranger did not attend. The conference
which ensued was a long one?lasting
two hours at least, according to mv recollection.
I cannot pretend to detail all
that was said; neither can I undertake
to give the language employed bv the
President upon every point, nor of the
members of the Cabinet. I can only
state the suinstance of what was said upon
those points which most attracted my attention.
|
The President commenced bv stating
? C1
that he had been waited upon that morn- I
ing by a committee of Members of Con. j
^ress, who desired to know his views up- I
in the subject of a hank?such a one as
ie could sanction. He had given them
no satisfaction upon that subject, but bad
informed them that he would first consult
with his constitutional advisers?his
Cabinet?through whom he thought it
most regular that his views should be
communicated. He asked the opinion of
his Cabinet upon the correctness of the
ground he had taken; remarking at the
same time, that the habit of expressing
his views to Members of Congress upon
subjects of so much interest subjected
him. to great embarrassment and much
misrepresentation. That question lieing
disposed of, the President adverted briefly
hut without much connexion, to the re
in lion in which he stood to liie Hank
(jut-siion, and hi* disposition to go as far
as he could to comply with the wishes of
his friends. He spoke of the relation
that existed between him and his Cabinet,
and how necessary it was that lie
should have their support. Would they
stand by hiin? Ho much preferred that
the whole subject should l)e postponed
until the next session; but if it was nerressnrv
to act now, lie thought a plan
might lie devised which, with their co.
operation, might be carried through. He
wondered why the Senate continued to
post|>one acting upon his Veto Message,
which was yet to be disposed of. He
supposed it might be to hold it as a rod
over his head; md had some doubts
whether it was proper that he should consider
further upon the subject until the
Senate had decided what they would do
with the hill then before them. Some
one present assured him that the post,
ponementnf the question pending in the
in the Senate was intended to give time
for reflection, and to prevent an intemperate
debate.
The President then gave the outline of
such hank or tisccal institution as he
- *- .
thought lie could sanction. It was ih ne
in tliw District of Columbia, to have the
privilege of issuing its own own notes,
receive moneys on deposite, and to deal
in bills of exchange between States and
between the United States and foreign
State*. But he wished to have the opinion
of his Cabinet upon it. His own
consistency and reputation must be looked
to. He considered his Cabinet his
friends, who must stand by and defend
whatever he did upon the subject. He
appealed particularly to Mr. Webster for
his opinion upon the point of consistency;
and whether there was not a clear dis
tinction between the old Hank ot the
United States?a bank of discount and
tleposite?and the gne he now thought of
proposing ; and whether the constitution,
nl question was dot different. He reminded
us, that in all his former speeches
and reports, he had taken the ground
that Congress had no constitutional pow.
er to charter a hank which the power of
local discount. Mr. Websterpointed out
the distinction between the two plans in a
manner which appeared to he satisfactory
to him. The substance of what he said
was, as I understood him, as follows : He
had a decided preference to a hank upon
the plan then proposed over either of those
which had been previously spoken of.?
He reminded the President that he had
expressed his preference for a hank which
should he restricted in its dealings to mils
of exchange, when certain gentlemen
were present several weeks before. He
\
then thought as he did now, that it would
answer all useful purposes. One ground
of this preference was, and it had great
weight with him, that the plan did not
contemplate the consent of the States as,
in any way or at any time, necessary tu
its existence or efficiency. He thought
the plan proposed at the commencement
of the session, generally known , as Mr.
Ewing's bill, as inccngrous and objectionable
on this ground. His general course
of thinkinn on such subjects led him to
prefer that, whatever power thi3 Government
asserted, or was authorized to asseFl
should be exercised independently o!
State authority, and of the interference
of the States. He thought there could
be no doubt of the constitutional powei
to charter such a bank as was then proposed,
according to the President's own
modes of thinking upon that subject, il
he understood them. Certainly there
was a clear distinction between sucb a
bank and the late Bank of the United
Stares. The one now proposed was tc
he limited in its operations to such sub.
jects as were clearly within some of the
general provisions of the Constitution,
or such as were clearly necessary in the
execution of others. The privilege ol
issuing its own notes, of dealing in exchanges,
and of receiving moneys on
depositc, all appeared to have immediate
to or connexion with the power given in
the Constitution over commerce between
the States, over the currency, and the necessary
fi*cull operations of the Governmenl
in the collection, safe-keeping, and
disbursement of the public revenue.?
Taese were all subjects of national, and
not local or of State concern. The distinction
between this plan and the /ate
Bank of the United S'ntcs lay in this:
the privilege enjoyed by the old bank, ol
dealing in local paper, or discounting
notes having no circulation, as it m'ghl
l>e, hut between the different streets ot
commercial points of the same city had
no connexion with the trade or commerce
lietween the States and remote sections
of the Union, nor with the transfer of the
public money from one point to another;
and it had, therefore, no necessary connexion
with any of the great national
objects for which the bank was chartered;
not could it be claimed as an incident to
any of the powers given to Congress by
the Constitution. That privilege, he ap.
prehended, was conlerred upon the late
hank from the belief that without it the
stock of the bank could not be made pro
| titable; and it was therefore considered
as a necessarrv incident to an institution
which was itself hut the offspring of an
incidental power. Experience, bethought
! had shown clearly that such a privilege
; was no longer important or necessary.?
By confining the discounting privilege o(
the proposed hank to bills of exchange
between this country and foreign States,
and between the several Stntes of the
Union, this objection, will not lie against
it.
The President expressed his regret thai
he had not used the words "tank of dis.
count and deposite" in his Inte Message,
so that the distinction he now took might
he clearly inferred from that message,
and he could not then be charged with in.
consistency. Mr. Bndgersaid he thought
nothing would have been gained by the
use of the terms " tank of discount
deposite" in his message; and
for, as to the charge of inconsistency, it
might, and probably would, ta made a.
gainst him for party effect, if he sanction,
ed the hill then proposed bv him, inas.
much as dealing in or buying bills of ex.
change would be discounting, and to that
extent make it a tank ofdiscount.
Whenever nil the mnterinl points ap.
peared to be disposed of, and.the members
of the Cabinet present had expressed their
decided approbation of the plan the President
had suggested he said that, after nil.
he would not sanction a bank in the form
just agreed upon, if he supposed that it
would be made the groundwork or basis
of a bank with all the powers of the Inte
Pank of the United States. He never
would give his sanction to the power of
local discount. He feared thnt, at the
next or succeeding sessions of Congress,
the Whigs would l>e bringing forward atnendmenls
engrafting this power upon
any charter he might now approve ; and
he appealed to his Cabinet to know if they
would stand by him, and use their influence
in preventing any such movements
while his Administration lasted. Mr.
Webster and others gave him all proper
assurances upon this point.
The President thought a capital of fif.
teen millions of dollars would be sufficient.
A name, he said, was important. What
should it be ? Fiscal Institute would do.
It was objected to,and the name of Fiscal
Bank preferred bv^a member of the Cabi.
net. He replied that there was a greal
deal in a name, and he did not wish the
word hank to appear in the bill.
The President then inquired if he wa.<
understood. He said there must be n<
misunderstanding of what he proposed tc
4 u :? i in. r.v..:
00. AtKirCHSIIIJS 1111119^11 IU mi. I^WIfin,
he asked hiin if he thought he understood
his views fully. Mr. Ewing undertook
to recapitulate. He understood the Pres.
ident to have no objection to a bank ir
the District of Columbia with offices o|
discount and deposite in the States, with
their assent. The President interrupte(
him abruptly, by saying he did not under
stand him at all: he was not willing tc
sanction any such hank. I understooc
his objection to be to the power of loca
nt I snnoosed Mr. Ewincr intend
UI^/uiivi ? --pf ^
ed to say that he understood" the Presi
dent had no constitutional objections t<
such a bank. Mr. Ewing, however
without explaining, wen'o n to say, tha
he now understood the President to have
I no objection ton bank in the District of
Columbia, with the power to issue its own
notes, receive moneys on deposite, with
offices or agencies in the States having
| the privilege, without their assent, of i
z dealing in bills of exchange drawn in one
State or Territory and made payable in
another State or Territory of the Union,
and in bills between the United States
and foreign States or Nations.
The President said he was then under>
stood. He requested Mr. Webster particularly
to communicate with the gentlet
men who had waited upon him that mornr
ing, and to let them know the conclusions
. to which he had come. He also reques.
| ted Mr. Ewing to aid in getting the sub.
ject properly before Congress. He requested
that they would take care not to
! commit him by what they said to members
- of Congress to any intention to dictate
( to Congress. They might express their
confidence and belief that such a bill as
| hnd just been agreed upon would receive
his sanction; but it should be as matter of
' inference from hislVeto Men sage and his
general views. He thought he might re
quest that the measure should be put into
, the hands of some friend of his own upon
i whom he could rely. Mr. Sergeant was
named and he expressed himself satisfied
. i that he should have charrre of it. Heal
# I
i so expressed a wish to see the hill before
, it was presented to the House if it could
, be so managed.
( I then said, addressing myself to
Messrs. Webster and Ewing, that no time
was to be lost in communicating with
I gentlemen of Congress; that there was
danger that Mr. Ewing's bill would be :
taken up and reported to the House im'
mediately after the bill sent back to the
' Senate with the President's objections was
! disposed of.
As the members of the Cabinet rose to
depart, or just before, the President re;
quested Messrs. Webster and Ewing. as
I they had turned their attention more par.
ticularly to the subject, to furnish him
I with written arguments upon the points ,
, they had been discussing. He wanted
( them to fortify his own opinion, and to layup
for future reference.
