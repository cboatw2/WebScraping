But in his natural st*te he is a mild and,
inoffensive creature. In this state they
live together in large herds of five or six
hundred, and each of their companies is
always furnished bv faithful sentinels,
who give notice of the least danger.

China and the Cape of Good Hope; but
the mqst beautiful, generous, and swift of
the kind are found in Arabia. The Arabs
catch them in traps, and try their fieetness

Arabian horse being the only animal that
can keep up with this bird. The Spanish
jenet is counted next in value te the Arabias
barb; thdy are beautiful, but extremely
small. The' Italian horses are
fine large animals ; the Danish horses are
low and strong; the German horses are
small, but the Dutch excel all others, exthe
Emrlish. for the draught. The
race-horses of England possess the great,
est fleetness, and have run an English
mile in little more than a minute. The
horse was entirely unknown in the new
continent till introduced there by the
Spaniards.
< QUALITY OF MILK.
Several crops have been successively
filled while milking from one cow, producing
the following results ; in every case,
the quantity ofcream was found to in.
crease in proportion &s the process of milk,
ing advanced : in different cows, the pro.
portion varied, but in the greater number
the excess of cream in the last cup as
compared with the first, was as Iff to 1:
but, as in some cases the difference was
not so much, a fair average might be considered
as ten. or twelve to one. And
the difference in the quality of the two
sorts of cream was no less striking, the
I
cream given by the first drawn milk be- ]
ing thin, white, and without consistence,
while that furnished by the last was thick,

remaining in the different cups presented
similar differences, that which was drawn
first being very-poor, "blue; and having
the appearance of milk "and water, while
th^C in the last cup was of a yellowish
hue, rich, and tpthe eye and taste resem- I
bled cream rather than milk. It appears,
therefore, from these experiments, that if,
alter drawing seven or eight pints from a
cow, half a pint remains in the udder, not
only almost as much cream will be lost,
as the seven or eight pints will
fnrnish, but of such a quality as gives the
richest taste and color to the butter. This
fact has been corroborated by chemical
experiments, and holds good with respect
to the milk of all other animals.?blackcrs

How to cook Green Peas.?The common
method of cooking this delicious
vegetable, by boiling in water, is nearly
destructive to its flavor, at least so savs a
lady, who has sent as the following method
of preparing them for the table, after
experience, we must add is a great improvement.
' Place in the Bottom of

peas in the dish, two ounces of butter in
proportion to a peck of peas-?cover the
pan or boiler close, and place it over the

the table.' They can either be seasoned
in the pan or after taken out. Water extracts
nearly all the delicious quality of
the green pea, and is as fatal to their flavor
as it is destructive to a mad dog.?

Washington, July 16'.
' A comprbmise of the Bank question is
spoken of hv the friends of that measure
who have heretofore differed as to the
1brajwking pswer. It is proposed to mqdify
the amendment offered bv Mr. Rives,
-a /? . I m A
so as to require tne assent or tne otaies
to the establishment of branches, but reserving
to Congress the power to establish
branches, by special law, wherever
they may be necessary for tho convenience
of the government. Those who
objected to Mr. Rives' amendment, as an
abandonment of constitutional power, will
be reconciled by this provision. It is
supposed that the bill, thus framed, will
originate in the House and come to the
Senate; but the amendment may be offered
in the Senate.
Mr. Calhoun was to speak yesterday
on the Bank question and to o.Jer some
amendments, but Mr. Clay moved to
take up the Loan Bill. Mr. Calhoun
wished to go on with the Bank bill till it 1
was disposed of. Mr. Clay said the state !
of the Treasury was such as to require !

penditures were at the rate of two millions i
a month, and there was hut 8900,000 in '
the Treasury?which would not last a
fortnight. Some time would be occupied,
too, in obtaining the loan.
This led to a sharp conversation be- j
tween Mr. Clav, on one side, and Messrs.
Calhoun, King, of Ala., Benton and Linn
ou the.other, in regard to the delay of
business* in the Senate. Mr. Clay spoke
of <he rapidity wbth which the business of
the House was despatched under the new
rules which gave the majority a control
of the business of the body, but here, he
said, the businests was under the control
of the minority.' He also intimated th t
he would bring forward a similar nroj j
tion for the government ofth? 'vr- nc^> oi j
the Senate. His remarks were consid. j
ered and replied to !.v the Senators above
name t, as meant to introduce the previous
question in the Senate and into its quasi
committee of the whole. Mr. King said
? I J W ' A. !i , it _ J__.il ?? *r_

Lino was also very derided in his remarks
on; the suggestion. Mr. Clay said the
rule of the House which cut off long ,
epeechcs was very popular?rthe people '
troj'J never complain of such a curtail*'
'v'w
meijt of long speeches as was necessary to
I the action of Congress on the measures
| which the country required.
Mr.' Benton and Mr. King both pro|
posed to Mr. Clay to take the Bank out
of committee on Saturday night, have it
printed, and take the final question on it
Monday night?rbut. they required that
the interval should be devoted to the bill,:
The conversation was cut off by the
motion of Mr, Berrien to go into Executive
session, abouthalf-pasteleven o'clock.
Mr. Calhoun opposed the motion, as he,
wished to proceed with the B&nkbffl, but
being assured thgt the Business was important,
he withdrew his objections. The
whole of the remainder of the day was
passed in secret session.
* The House occupied the day with the
discussion of the Fortification bill, but it
was not disposed of.
There is a rumor that Mr. Fox has
contingent instructions to ask his passports
in case McLeod is sent to trial.
Much anxiety is felt here on the subject.
Washington, July 17.
It is denied here that the British Minister,
Mr. Fox, has any instructions, as has
been rumored, which will render it neces.
sary .for him to take any course of an unfriendly
character towards this govern
ruent, in consequence of the present
aspect of the M'Leod case. It is asserted
that the British government will be satisfied
with the disposition exhibited by our
government in relation to the matter*
Our relations with England were alJu.
ded to in the debates yesterday, and in a
spirit of harmony and patriotism that is
auspicious for the public welfare.
I make one or two extracts from the
discussion.
Mr. Cushing, in reply to some remarks
of a previous day, from Mr. Rhett, questioned
the correctness of Mr. It's position,
that the real difficulty between the government
of the United Stale? and Great
Britain, had arisen nn !er :his Administration.
The demand for the ligation of
M'Leod was made on the 13th December,
nearly three rhonths before the Tate administration
went out of pow^r; and Mr.
Pickens' celebrated report trcat<jd it as a
solemn matter,- presenting an issue of,
peace or war. Mr. C expressed his high
gratification at the patriotic and honorable
tone of the remarks of Mr. Rhett in
regard to his readiness to stand by the
country whenever its honor should be assailed,
and he regretted that the question
should ever have been mooted as to what
administration it was. under which a national
difficulty should have arisen. Bnt
as the question had been raised, he tiesired
that the facts should be accurately
stated and understood. Should a solemn
public question grow out of the existing
state of things, he trusted the Committee
on Foreign Relations would continue to
present, as on all such questions it had
hitherto presented, an undivided front.
Mr. Rhett disclaimed any intention, in
the remarks he had made, to impute blame
to the present administration, or commendation
to that wbich had lately been in
power as to this M'Leod controversy; and.
under which of them the question had become
so serious a matter, was perfectly
immaterial In r#?f*?rpnr?p tn lh? lnst*dft.
mand of the British government for the
immediate release of AfcLeod, Mr. R
said?' It was this letter and Mr. Webster's
answer to it which constituted-the
issue between the two nations; and in relation
to that issue it was his own opinion
that one- of the two nations must recede,
or else & resort to war seamed, inevitable."
"Mr. Pickens made* an explanation of
the history of his report, and in cbhclitsioq
said, he could not entirely agheo'
wfth his colleague, Mr. Rhett* in what he
had-said as to the issue between the countries
being such that one or the* other of
them must recede, or sacrifice its honor.

He considered the demand by Mr. Fox
as having been made in a remarkably
cautious manner. The language was
guarded ; and he did not consider it as
precluding all adjustment of the question
without directly abandoning the grounds
taken. Great delicacy and caution were |
manifest in the choice of language, and
Mr. P did not think the government so
entirely commi ted as his colleague seem,
ed to suppose. He hoped McLeod would
be found innocent, and acquitted. But

and the saacuty of its Juciciary, that he
would be cried.
Mr. M'Keon suggested that the British
government, ifter learning that the judieiary
of the State of New York would
probably deem it proper to wait the re.
suit of 3/cLeod's trial. That government
was prudent, and would ponder well
the mutual interests of both nation ir. a
state of peace. She could not nut knr?V
the state of the American moid, and 1
that, armed or unarmed, ve were ready
to defend our rights at all times; end !
must be aware that no power on ear:!)
could get McLeod out of the hands of the
judiciary of the State of New York '.ill
he was delivered by due course of law.
He expressed his hope that McL H
would be ablo to prove an alibi, and so be
acquited. And as to the other question
of the Caroline, ho did not think it likely
to lead to war. He announced his purp?se
to pursue the subject from week to
week, till he should see some.satisfaction
for this outrage on our rigb's. As long as
he hnd a seat in Congress he shoula in.

and, if guiltv, to execn'e him; and
he should iiieo render all the aid in his

Washington July, 18th.
In the House, yesterday, Mr. Arnold
of Tenn., moved to reconsider the reaolution
for talcing out of committee, at 2
o'clock, the Fortification kill. He said it
was useless for the House to hurry its
business. There were breakers ahead.
Though the House was prepared to do
the business which the people required,
yet great obstacles would delay business
in the Senate. He had been informed by
a distinguished Senator [meaning
Clay] that it was doubtful whether the
great measure df the sessiidn cotlhf - jtoss.
The Virginia doctrines were in thb' ascendant.
While Mr. A. was making remarks
of this sort, he was repeatedly called
to order, and many members interrupting
him. The Locos cried out, "God
grant it may be so." Mr. Botts exclaimed?"
Wait for ten days, and you will
find yourself mistaken." Finally Mr.
Arnold,, was stopped. The previous
question was moved and seconded by the
casting vote of the Speaker. The resolution
was reconsidered acid withdrawn.

both the accused have already fallen

while their victim was still alive; and the
possibility of his recovery existed. These
extraordinary facts were communicated
to the Cincinnati Republican by a highly
respectable citizen of Kentucky, who had
the details of the transaction from several
persons who witnessed them; and from
(bat paper we gather the following partic.
ulars.
At the time of the execution, the prisoners
had been in confinement in the jail
in Williamstown, Grant county, Ky., on
the above charge. Mr. Utterback, if
seems, has been lingering in a miserable
state?his throat having been shocking!)
mangled?at a tavern some throe or foui
miles beyond Williamstown, on a much
travelled road, and an object of cora.niser

creased whether the utmost penalty of thi
law would be visited upon the prisoners
nothing less than which, it seemed, wouh

the citizens of that county, therefore, de
liberately resolved upon the summarj
execution. They first deputed ten citi

and inform the citizens of the place, am

prison, for religious converse with the
prisoners.
On Saturday, in pursuance of the no
tice, about 500 citizens of Bourbon, t<
which were added some from Scott an<
Harrison counties, went into Williams
town in solemn procession and most per
feet order. They had chosen their sher
iffs to act for the occasion, and pro
ceeded to the jail, and demanded the pris
oners, Maythe and Couch. The sherif
of Grant refused to give them up, or th<
keys of the prison: he offered however n<
other resistance, and the people at one
broke open the doors. They then tool
the prisoners, placed them in an npei
wagon, their irons on them, took up thei
line of march without the least noise o
confusion, totbespot ofground where th<
murder was attempted, about four mile
distant. By this time the number as
sembled was believed to have been a
least two thousand. After arriving on th<
ground, Mr. O'Hara, a member of the bar
addressed the people for some time upoi
the propriety of permitting the law ti
take its course. He was listened to witl
the utmost silence and respect, but with
out apparently altering the determinate
of. a single person present. The prelim
inaries were then adjusted and the pris
oners asked if they had anything to sr.]
previous to the closing of their earthl;

1 they ever saw; it is truly an etc&tiucty
hot Town, and how can it be otherwise,
' t t ?
, when all our houses are painted white^
I our soil pure sand, (which in dry weather ,
i is nearly as white as the houses) wife ^
' scarcely a tree to break the ravs of a'
j ,,-*Y
r scorching summer's sun?
r Aii will admit their utility and the
\ cessity that exists for them, to say nothing
' of how much it would add to the beairty
J of the Town to have a handsome row^ of
s forest trees, such as the Elm, the Syca.
> more, the Oak, <fcc. planted along every
' side walk, and from one end of the street#
j to the other, but what is every bodys business
happens to be nobody's, and that I
. suppose to be the reason it has not long
! ago been done.
j I call your attention to this auhjpcl now
I* because it is just the time we can realize
how much they are needed, for if we ptyi
/ off a consideration of it until the proper
* time for transplanting, we may then fotj
get how hot it was and be disposed to act
' as the fellow did at whose cabin a .gen- >
. tleman called to g^t shelter from g hard
* rain, he found on entering that the rife'
1 was pouring through the roof like a wdM*
' and the owner sitting in the only
where it did not leak, scratching away
. with all his might on an old fiddle# . Why
> my good man, enquired the stranger, don't
* you put a new roof on your bouse f? '
* I Why, because said be when itdon't. rain
. fti?re is no use for it, and when it doee I ...
* can't do it. ' V \
' Well now. gentlemen, taking ft ft*
b granted that you and all the Town agree
0 with me that jt would add very much, to ^
e the beauty and comfort of the place to r
^ have every principal street studded wttfcrw
| row of good shade trees, the question an-*
P scs, how can it he done?
' ; u;\ 9
I will suggest for your consideration
* three plans: First?Pans a law (if yon
' have the right so to do) requiring every
B owner of a lot or lots to plant, next Febrnitrv
op March, tk TOW of tlWf OPPO#t|
, ...... J ... T _
i his lots, and if any lots are owned by pes*
J sons not living here, let the Council hare
trees planted in front of all such, and lay
o a tax upon them sufficient to pay the ex*
pense. > i
Skcond plan?Let the Town Council
undertake the business, let out the con*
. tract to the lowest bidder and pay the
l. whole expense by an additional J?x if to*
r cessarv, on real estate. *
9
Thud Plan?If neither or the aborts
(| are feasible, lot it be done by general
d , subscription, and as every man, woman
r and child will be benefitted by it, surety
' there will be no difficulty in raising a
. sufficient amount. The cost will be much
v " '* - *
less than many would suppose, a mere
trifle compared to the benefit; each square
* contains I believe 12 lots, the distance
^ from corner to corner being 600 feet**
. 2400 feet sll ron i.i, at the distance of 20
j feet apart (which is probably too close) it
h will take but 120 trees to a square, tliese
^ may be furnished and set out at 25 cents *
or less per tree, miking the cost per
square about thirty dollars.
e| I trust the subject may be deemed of
n sufficient importance to awaken an inter*
" e*t
in the citizens and induce you to take
h such measures as you may think advisa*
n ble to have the object effected before
