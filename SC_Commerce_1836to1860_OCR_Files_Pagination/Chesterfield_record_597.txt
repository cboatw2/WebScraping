expedient, but your Committe were unanimous
in recommending an Agriculturnl
Survey of the State, and I will, here,
briefly inenlson its purport and advantages.
An Agricultural survey, relates to the
nature of the soul, particularly in reference
to the crops cultivated ; to the climate,
with reference to the crops grown;
to the number of acre cultivated; to the
quantity of land in wood, in pasture, in
roads, or under water; to the objects of
culture, the modes adopted, and the proceeds:
to manure; to live stock of all kinds,
in their relative utility, for pleasure, Jla.bour,
food, and the dairy ; to dairy produce
: to poultry, diseases of domestic
animals; to bees, orchards, gardens, farm
buildings, farming impliments; to silk,
and many miscellaneous subjects. The
duty of an Agricultutal Surveyor, is, to
visit every District and Parish in the
State; every principal farm or plantation,
the management of which, promises to
afford useful information ; to correspond
and co operate with practical men, or, in
the words of the resolve of the MassachuI.i>(Tiabfiirp
" nppnroto in.
formation, of the state and condition of
the agriculture of the Commonwealth,
and every subject oonnected with it, point
out the means of improvement, and make
a detailed report thereof, with as much
exactness as circumstances will admit."
.Your Committee will add nothing further
to these details, than advert to the fact,
that arery Executive Message, directs
the atten ion of the Legislature to thin
subject, but from a misguided spirit of economy,
the call has, hitherto, been neglected.
It becomes us, now, to act with
independence, and prop our waning fortunes
: policy requires, it, patriotism demands
it, and our duty forbids us to neglect
the welfare of our country. Your
Committee consider their duty fulfilled,
in offering these views, and pressing the
adoption of the following resolutions.
Resolved, That an Agricultural Survey
of the State of South Carolina, is highly
necessary and expedient; that it will he
a means of developing and improving
her resources; retaining at home, her
A I f I r*r\ M ^1 n A ,il<\ (t A In L AitM n ?. / ] A
cilia s;avc iciuwui, nun u<juiucincting,
in some measure, the effects of competition
in her grent staple, from the fertility
of new lands in other States.
Resolved, That the result of each year's
survey bo annually reported to this
House, and copies distributed to every
Agricultural Society throughout the State.
Resolved, That the sum of three thousand
dolla'9 be appropriated for the ensu.
ing year, to said survey; and that the
(iovernor be specially 'charged with the
selection of a capable person to execute
the same.
All of which is respect fully submitted.

% PRESIDENT S MESSAGE
At twelve o'clock yesterday the Presi.
dwijt of the United States transmitted to
both Houses of Congress the following
Message:
. To (he Senate and House of
Representatives of the United States :
In coining together, fellow-citizens, to
center again upon the discharge of the duties
with which the People have charged
us. s^vcrallv. we find nrnat occasion to
_... - ?. i e rejoice
in the. general prosperity of the
country. We ure in the enjoyment of all
the blessings of civil and religions liberty,
with unexampled means of education,
knowledge, and improvement. Through
ihe vear which is now drawing to a close
pence has been in our borders and plenty
in our habitations; and although disease
has visited some few portions of the land
with distress and mortality. yet in general
the health of the People has been preserved,
and we are called upon hv the highest
obligations of duty to renew our thanks
and our devotion to onr Heavenly Parent
who has.continued to vouchsafe to us the
eminent blessings which surround us, and
who has so signally crowned the year
with his goodness. If we find ourselves
tncreaseing, beyond example, in numbers,
in'&trenglh, in wealth, in knowledge, in
very thing which promotes human and
social happiness, let us remember our dependence
for all these on the protection
and merciful dispensations of Devine Providence.
Since your last adjournment, Alexander
AfeLeod a British subject, who was indieted
for the murder of an American citizen,
and whosa case has been the subject
of a correspondence heretofore communicated
to you, has been acquitted by the
verdict of.an impartial and intelligent jury,
and has, under the judgement of the court
been regularly discharged.
Great Britain having made known to
this Government that the expedition
which was fitted out from Canada for the
destruction of the steamboat Caroline, in
the winter of 1837, and which resulted in
the destruction ot said hoat and in the
death of an American citizen, was undertaken
hy orders emanating from the authorities
Aof the British Government in
Canada, and demanding the discharge ol
McLeod upon the ground that, if engaged
w that expedition he did but fulfil the orof
his Government, has thus been
answered in the only way in which she
could bo answered bv a Government, (he
powers of ivhieli nrcMistributed among it*
several departments by the fundainenta
taw. Happily for tiie people of Great Bri
tain as well as those of the United States lh(.
onlv mode by which an individual ar.
raigned for a criminal oflence before thi
courts of either can obtain his discharge
is hy the independent acti ?n of the judiciary.
and by proceedings equally familiar
to the courts of both countries.
Jf in Great Britain a power exists in
jfee Crown to cause to he entered a n >IIc
prosequi, which is not the case with the
Executive power of the United States upon
a prosecution pending in a State court
yet there, no more than Acre, can the
chief executive power rescue a pri mmer
? _
from custodv without an order of the
J #
proper tribunal directing his discharge.
The precise stage of the proceedings at
which .such order may be.made is a matter
ofinunicipal regulation exclusively and not
to be complained of by any other *Govemmont.
In cases of this kind, a Gov'
eminent becomes politically responsible .
i only when its tribunals are shown to
! have rendered unjust and injurious judgI
ments in matters not doubtful. To the
: establishment and elucidation of this
J principle, no nation has lent its authority
more efficiently than Great Britain. Al
exander McLeod having his option either
j to prosecute a writ of error from the decicision
of tho Supreme Court of New York
which had been rendered upon his appli.
1 cation for a discharge, to the Supreme >
Court of the United States, or to submit
j his case to the decision of a jury, preferred
; the latter, deeming it the readiest mode
! of obtaining his liberation; and the result
! has fully sustained the wisdom of his
! choice. The manner in which the issue
j submitted was tried will satisfy the En
glish Gvernment that the principles of
justice will never fail to govern the enlightened
decision of an American tribuj
nal. I cannot fail, however, to suggest
I to Gongress the propriety, and in some
! degree the necessity, of making such pro1
visions hv law, so far as they may conj
stitutionally do so, for the removal at
; the option of the party, of all such cases as
mav'hereafterarise and which may involve
| the faithful observance and execution of
our international obligations, from the
J State , to the Federal Judiciary. This
Government, by our institutions, is charI
ged with the maintenance of peace and
I the preservation of amicable relations
with the nations of the earth, and ought
to possess without question, all the reasonable
and proper means of maintaining the
j one and preserving the other.' YVhi 1st
tjust confidence is felt in the Judiciary ol
th<* States yet this Government ought to
be competent in itself for the fulfilment
of the high duties which have beendevolvedjupon
it under the organic law, by the
States themselves.
In the month of September, a party of
armed men from Upper Canada, invaded
j the territory of the United States, and
forcibly seized upon the person of one
Grogan, and under circumstances of
great harshness, hurriedly carried him
, i i
beyond the limitsot the united oiaies,
and delivered him up to the authorities of
! Upper Canada. His immediate discharge
j was ordered hy those authorities, upon the
| facts of the case being brought to their,
j knowledge?a course of procedure which
( was to have been expected from a nation
with whom we are at peace, and which
was not more due to the rights of the
United States, than to its own regard for
i justice. The correspondence which passed
between the Department ofState, and
| the British Envoy, Mr. Fox, and with the
Governor of Vermont, as soon as the facts
had been made known to this Department,
are herewith communicated.
; I regret that it is not in my power to
make known to you an equally satisfac- i
j torv conclusion in the case of the Caroj
line steamer, with the circumstances connected
with the destruction of which, in
December, 1637, by an armed force fitted
out in the province of Upper Canada, you
; are already made acquainted. No such j
; atonement as was due for the public
; wrong done to the United Slates by this j
invasion of her territory, so wholly irre- j
concilable with her rights as an indepen- .
, dent power, has yet been made. 1 n the j
view taken by this Government, the in- j
i nuirv whether the vessel was in the era- j
J plovmentof those who were prosecuting j
an unauthorized war against that pro- j
j vince, or was engaged by the owner in the
; business of transporting passongers to and i
1 from Navv Island, in hopes of private
' gain, which was most probably the case,
! in no degree alters the real question nt issue
between the two governments. This
Government can never concede to any
foreign Government the power, except, in
I a case of the most urgent and extreme
necessity, of invading its territory, either
I to arrest the parsons or destroy the prop.
ertynf those who may have violated the
municipal laws of such foreign Government,
or have disregarded their obligations
arising under the law of nations.
The territory of the Unitod States, must
i he regarded as sacredly secure against all
I such invasions, until they shall voluntarii
ly acknowledge their inability to acquit
themselves of their duties to others. And
in announcing this sentiment, I do but affirm
i? principle which no nation on earth
' would be more teady to vindicate at all
j hazards, than the people and Government
.ofGreat Britain.
j If, upon a full investigation of all the
facts, it shall appear that the owner of
the Caroline was governed by a hostile
intent, or had made common cause with
tiiose who were in theoccupany of Navy
Island, then, so far as he is concerned,
j there can he no claim to indemnity for
I the destruction of his boat, which this Government
would feel itself bound to pros.
| ecute, since he would have acted not only
I in derogation of the rights of Great Bri]
tairr, hut in clear violation of the laws of
j the Uniied States; but that is a question
| which, however settled, in no manner in,
volvps the higher consideration of the
i violation of territorial sovereignty and
I jurisdiction. To recognise it as an ad|
missihle practice that each government,
in its turn, upon any sudden and unauthorized
out.break, which, on a frontier,
the extent of which renders it impossible
j for eiiner to have an efficient force on
every mile of it, and which out-break,
J therefore, neither may he able to suppress
in a day, may take vengeance into its own
: hands, and without even a remonstrance.
; and in the absence of any pressing or
j overrulling necessity, may invade the
! territory of the other, would inevitably
lead to results equally to he deplored by
both. When border collision* come to
receive the sanction, or to be made on n
the authority of either Government, gen- tl
era I war most be the inevitable result, n
While it is the ardent desire of the Uni- tl
ted States to cultivate the relations of b
peace with all nations, and to fulfil all the i h
duties of good neighborhood towards those I d
who possess territories adjoining their j p
own, that very desire would lead them to
deny, the right of any foreign power to in- e
vade their boundary with an armed force, t
The correspondence between the two u
Governments on this subject, will, at a c
future day of your session, be submitted I:
to your consideration; and in the mean v
time, I cannot but indulge the hope that i
che British Government will see the pro- ?
priety of renouncing, as a rule of future [
action, the precedent which has been set
in the affair at Schlosser. \
I herewith submit the correspondence t
which has recently taken place between r
the American Minister at the Court ot I
St. James, Mr. Stevenson, and the Min- t
ister of Foreign Affairs of that Govern- (
mcnt, on the right claimed by that Gov- t
ernment to visit and detain vessels sailing I
under the American flag and engaged in i
prosecuting lawful commerce in the Afri- i
can seas. Our commercial interests in I
that region have experienced considerable i
increase, and have become an object of i
much importance, and it is the duty of I
this Government to protect them against i
all improper and vexatious interraption. |
However desirous the United States may
be for the suppression of the slave trade, 1
they cannot consent to interpolations in- i
to the maritime code, at the more will and i
pleasure of other governments. We deny <
the right of any such interpolation to any i
one, or nil the nations of the Earth, with- i
out our consent. Who claim to have a
voice in all amendments or alterations of
that code?and when we are given to understand,
as in this instance, by a foreign i
Government, that its treaties with other
nations cannot he executed without the
estahlisnment and enforcement of new
principles of maritime police, to he applied
without our consent, we mu-t employ a
I _ _ - - ! - t _ | _ . _
language nenner equivocal, or susceptible
of misconstruction.?American citizens
prosecuting a lawful commerce in
I the African seas, under the flag of their i
country; are not responsible for the abuse
or unlawful use of that flog by others; nor i
can they rightfully on account of any
such alleged abuses, belntorrupted, molested
or detained while on'the ocean ; and
if thus molested and detained, while pursuing
honest voyages, in the usual way,
and violating no law themselves, they are
unquestionably entitled to indemnity
This Government has manifested its repugnance
to the slave frade, in a manner
which cannot be misunderstood. By its
fundamental law. it presscribed limits in
point of time to its continuanea; and against
its own cilifceOfo, who might so farforget
the rights of h iimanity ns to engage
in that wicked traffic, it has long since,
hy its municipal laws, denounced the
most condign punishment. Many of the
States composing this Union, had made
appeals to the civilized world for its suppression,
long before the moral sense of
other nations had become shocked by
the iniquities olf the traffic.
Whether thijs Government should now
enter into treaties contninining mutual
stipulatioas upon this subject, is a question ,
for mature deliberation. Certain it is
that if the right to detain American ship
on the high seas can he justified on the
[?lea of a necessity for such detention ; nris.ng
o'ut of the existence of treatise between
other nations, the same plea may be
?i ? i i i L.. it. ...
e.vienci-ea ana eniargeu i?y new angulations
of new treaties, to which the United
States may not be a party. This
Government will not cease to urge upon
that of Great Britain, full and ample remuneration
for all losses, whether arising
from detention or otherwise, to which American
citizens have heretofore been, or
may hereafter be subjected, by the exer.
; cise of rights which this Government cannot
recognise as legitimate and proper.
Nor will I indulge a doubt but that the
sense of justice of Great Britain will constrain
her to make retribution for anv
! wrong, or loss, which any American citi-1
zei), engaged in the prosecution of lawful j
commerce, may have experienced nt the |
braids of her cruisers, or otbor public nutUorities.
This government ot the same
M/ill mtnv nrt Aifirt tn nrovent its !
citizens, if*there be any so disposed, from
prosecuting a traffic so revolting to the
feelings of humanity. It seeks to do no
more than to protect the fair and honest
trader from molestation and injtry; but
while the enterprising mariner, engaged
in the pursuit of an honorable trade, is entilled
to its protection, it will visit with
condign punishment others of an opposite
character,
I invite your attention to the existing
laws for the suppression of the African
slave-trade, and recommend all such alterations
as may give to them greater
force and efficacy. That an American
flag is grossly abused hy the abandoned
and profligate of other nations, is but too
probable. Congress has not long since,
had the subject under consideration, and
ils importance well just ties renewed and
anxious attention.
I also communicate herewith a copy of
a correspondence between Mr. Stevenson
] and Lord Palmorston, upon the subject

D
States, of the rice duties which resulted
honorably to the justice of Great Britain,
and advantageously to the United States.
At the opening of the last annual session
the President informed Congress of
the progress which had been made in
negotiating a Convention between this
Government and that of England, with a
view to the final settlement of the quosof
the boundary between th^ territorial
limits of the two countries. 'I regret to
say that little farther advancement of the
object has been accomplished since last
year f hut this is owing to circumstances
; *
o ways indicative of any abatement of g
ie desire of both parties, to hasten the a
ogoliation to its conclusion, and :o settle w
be question in dispute as early ai possi- w
!e. In the course of the session it is my
ope to be able to announce some further
agree of progress, towards tho accotnlishinent
of this highly desirable end.
The commission appointed by this gov- .
rnment for the exploration and survey of "
he line of boundary separating the State a
>f Maine and New Hameshire fiom tho I'
:ounterminious British Provinces is, it is h
telieved, about to close its field labors, and C
8 expected soon to report the results of t<
ts examination to the Department of g
State. The report, when receded, will jj
ie laid before Congress. s
The failure on the part of Spain to pay, j
vith punctuality, the interest due under
he Convention of 1834, for the settle- ^
nonl nf rlnims between the two countries |
las made it the duly of the Executive ^
o call the particular attention of that c
jrovemment to the subject. A disposi- e
ion has been manifested by it, which is *
iclreved to be entirely sincere, to fulfil
ts obligations in this respect, so soon as a
ts internal condition and the state of its 9
inanr.es will permit. An arrangement t
s in progress, from the result of which, it (
s trusted that those of our citizeis who
lave claims under the Convention, will, ?
it no distant day, receive the stipulated ,
payments. |
A treaty of Commerce and Navigation ,
with Belgium was concluded and signed ,
at Washington on the *29th March, 1840, |
and was duly sanctioned by the Senate |
af the United States. The Treaty was j
ratified by his Belgian Majesty, but did ,
not receive the approbation of the Bel- |
gian Chambers within the lime limited by (
its terms, and has, therefore, become void.
This occurrence assumes the graver
aspect from the consideration that in
1833, a Treaty negotiated between the (
two Governments, and ratified on the j
part of the United Stales, failed to be rat |
ified on the part of Belgium. The represcntative
of that Government, at Washington,
informs the Department of State
that he has been instructed to give ex- ,
planations of the causes which occasioned
delay in the approval of the late treaty by
the Legislature, and to express the regret
of the King at the occurrence.
JFThe joint commission under the Convention
with Texas, to ascertain the true
boundaiy between the two countries, has
concluded its labors: hut the finnl report
of the commissioner of the United States
has not been received. It is understood
however, that the mercdian line, as traced
by the commission, lies somewhat farther
East than the position hitherto generally
assigned to it, and, consequently, includes
in Texas some part of the territory which
had been considered a9 belonging to the
States of Louisiana and Arkansas.
The United States cannot but take a
deep interest in whatever relates to this
young, hut growing Republic. Settled
principally by emigrants from the United
States, we have the happiness to know,
that the great principles of civil liberty
are there destined to flourish, under wise
institutions and wholesome laws ; and that
through its example, another evidence is
to be afforded of the capacity of popular
institutions, to advance the prosperity,
happiness, and permanent glory of the
human race. The great truth, that Goveminent
was made for the people, and not
the people for government, lias already
been established in the practice and by
the example of these United States; and
we can do no other than contemplate its
farther exemplification by a sister Republic,
with tiie deepest interest
Our relations with the independent
States of this hemisphere, formerly under
the dominion of Spain, have not undergone
any material change within the
past year. The incessant sanguinary
conflicts in, or between those countries,
are to he greallv deplored, as necessarily
tending to disable thern from performing
their cuties as members of the community
of nations, and rising to the destiny
which the position and natural resources
of many of them might lead them justly
to anticipate, as constantly giving occasion,
also, directly or indirectly, for complaints
on tho part of our citizens who
resort thither for purposes of commercial
intercourse, and as retarding reparation
for wrongs already committed, some of
which are by no meansef recent date.
" ^ . r p
The failure ot ine uon gross 01 dcuidor
to hold a session, at the time appointed
for that purpose, in January last, will
probably render abortive a treaty of commerce
with that Republic, which was
signed at Quito on the 13th of June, 1832,
and had been only ratified on our part,
but which required the approbation ofthat
body, prior to its ratification by the Ecuadorian
Executive.
A Convention which has been concluded
with the Republic of Peru, providing
for the settlement of certain claims of citizens
of the united States, upon the Gov- j
eminent of that Republic, will be duly i
submitted to the Senate.
The claims of our citizens, against the ,
Brazilian Government, originating from
' XZj ~
captures, and other causes, are still unsatisfied.
The United Slates have, however,
so uniformly shown a disposition to
cultivate relations of amity with that
Empire, that it is hoped, the tmequivoca
tokens of the same spirit towards u s
which an adjustment of the affairs refer
red to would afford, will bo given witiiou
farther avoidable delay.
The war with the Indian tribes on the
peninsula of Florida has, during the last
summer and fail, been prosecuted with
untiring activity anil zeal. A summer
campaign was resolved upon, as the best
mode of bringing it to a close. Our
brave officers und men who have been eu
aged in that service, have suffered toils tl
nd privations, and exhibited an energy, tr
rhich, in any other war, would have al
on for thcin unfading laurels. In de- 1 c'
pite of the sickness incident to the cli- m
late, they have penetrated the fustnes- ^
?s of the Indians broken up their en- J*
ampments, and harrassed them unceas- ^
igly. Numbers have been captured, ,
nd still surrendered, and have been |
ransported to join their brethren on the
inds elsewhere allotted to them by the 0
Government,?and a strong hope is en- je
ertained that, under the conduct of the I a
al la nt officer at the head of the troops a
a Florida, that troublesome and expen- n
ive war is destined to a speedy termina- tl
ion. With all tr.e other Indian tribes,
jq are enjoying the blessings of peace. n
)ur duty, as well as our best interests, n
rompt us to observe, in all our interourse
with them, fidelity in fulfilling our ^
ngagements, the practice of strict jusice,
as well as the constant exercise of
:cts of benevolence and kindness. These ti
ire the great instruments of civilization, c
ind through the use of them alone, can 8
he untutored child of the forest be indu- ^

The Secretary of State, on whom the t
tcts of Congress have devolved the duty n
)f directing the proceedings for the ta- 1
tinrr <.f th? Sixth Census or enumerations j3
"
of the inhabitants ofthe United States will '
eport to the two flouses the progress of j
hat work. The enumeration of persons c
las been completed, and exhibits a grand c
total of 17,009, 453; making an increase a
over the Census of 1830, of 4,202,046 in- '
habitants, and showing a gain in a ratio *
exceeding 32 1-2 der cent for the last ten .
t
years. t
From the report of the secretary of the (
Treasury, you will be informed of the (
condition of the finances. The balanee j t
in the Treasury ori the 1st of January I
last, as stated in the report of the Sec re- j(
tary of the Treasury, submitted to Con- ;
gross at the Extra Session, was 8997,- |
345 03. The recepts into the Treasury, |
during the first three quarters of this year, J
from our sources, amount to $23,487,- I
072,52. The estimated receipts for the j
fourth quarter amount to $5,943,095 25,
amounting to $30,410,167 77; and ma- 1
king, with the balance in the Treasury,
on the first of January last, $31,8097,512 ,
SO. The expenditures (or the first three j
quartets of this year, amount to $24,734,326
67. The expenditures for the fourth
quarter, as estimated, will amount to
$7,290,723 72:?thus making a total of
832,025,070 70; and leaving a deficit to
he provided for, on the first of Jan. next
of about $627,557 90.
Of the loan of $12,000,000 which was
authorized by Congress at its late session,
only $5,432,726 88 have been negotiatod.
The shortness of time which it had
to run, has presented no inconsiderable
impediment in the way of its being taken
by capitalists at home, while the some
cause would have operated with much
greater force in the foreign market. For
- * i
that reason the foreign has been resorted
to, and it is now .submitted, whether it
would not be advisable to amend the
law by making what remains undisposed
of payable at a more distant day.
Should it bo necessary, in any view
that Congress may take the subject, to
revise the existing tariff of duties, I beg
leave to say, that, in the performance of
that delicate operation, moderate counsels
would seem to ha the wisest. The
Government, under which it is our happiness
to live, owes its existence to the
spirit of compromise which prevailed
among its framcrs?jarring and discordant
opinions could only have been reconciled
hv that noble spirit of patriotism,
prompted which conciliation and resulted
in harmony, fn the same spirit the compromise
bill, as it is commonly called,
was adopted at the session of 1823.
Whilo the people of no portion of the
Union will ever hesitate to pay all necessary
taxes for support of Government, yet
an innate repugnance exists, to the impo
sit ion of hurl hens not realiy necessary tor
that object. In imposing duties, however,
for the purposes of revenue. a right
to discriminate as to tho articles on which
the duty shall ho laid, ns well as the
amount, necessarily and most proporlv
exists. Otherwise the government would
he placed in the condition of having to
levy the same duties upon all articles,
the productive as well as the unproductive.
The slightest duty upon some,
might have the effect of causing their
importation to cease, whereas others entering
extensively into the consumption
of the country, might hear the heaviest,
without any sensible diminution in the
amount imported. So also the Government
may he justified in so discriminaling,
by reference toother considerations
of domestic policy connected with our
manufactures. So long as the duties
shall he laid with distinct reference to
the wants of the Treasury. 110 well founded
objection can exist against them. It
might be desirable that no such augmentation
of the faxes should take place as
would have the effect of annulling the
land proceeds distribution act of the last
session, which act is declared to be inoperafivo
the moment the duties are increased
beyond 20 per cent, the maximum
rate established by the Compromise act.
Some of the provisions of the Compromise
act. which will go into effect on the
30th day of June next, may, however,
be found exceedingly inconvenient jn
practice, underany regulations that Congress
may adopt. I refer more particularly
to that relating to the home valuation.
A difference in value of the same
articles to some extent, will necessarily
exist at ditFerent ports?but that is altogether
insignificant, when compared with
ie conflicts in valuation which are likely
) arise, from the differences of opinion ^
mong the numerous appraisers of merbandize.
In many instances the estilates
of value must be conjectural, and
ius as many different rates of value may
j established as there are appraisers,
iiese differences in valuation may also
2 increased by the inclination which
ithout the slightest imputation on their
Dnesty; may arise on the part of the apraisers
in favor of their respective por$af
entry. f recommend this whole ?lb~
ict to the consideration of Congress, witfo
single additional lemark. Certainty
nd permanency in any system of govdrn-lental
policy are, in all respects, emineny
desirable; but more particularly is this
rue in all that affects trade and coinjerce,
the operations of which depend
mch more on the certainty of their reurns,
and calculations, which embrace
istant periods of time, than on high
ounties, or duties, which are liable to
onstant fluctuations.
At your late session I invited your alien*
ion to the condition of the currency and ex.
hanges, and urged the necessity ot adopting
uch measures as were consistent with the
onstitutional competency of the Government,
a order to correct the unsoundness of the on#,
nd as far as practicable the inequ&lties of
he other. No country can be in the enjoy..lent
of its full measure of prosperity without
he presence of a medium ot exchange apiroximatiug
to uniformity of value: . What is
iecessary as between the different nations
?f the earth is also important as between the
nhabitants of different pans of the same
:ountry. With the first, the precious metals
constitute the chief medium of circulation;
md such also would be the case as to the
ast, but for inventions, comparatively mod-'
srn, which have furnished, in place of gold
ind silver, a paper circulation. I do not pro"
>ose to enter into a comparative analalysis pf
he merits of the two systems. Such belonged
more properly to the period of the intro. ^
lucticnofthe paper system. The specula- ^
:ive philosopher might find inducements to
jrosecute the inquiry, but his researches could
wily lead him to couclude that the paper sys*
;em had probably beter never have been introfaced,
and that society might have been moch
>a?>pier without it. ino practical naw*
nan has a very different task to peribrflt.
Fie has to look at things as they are?to take
them as he finds tbem?to supply deficiencies,
and to prune excess, as far at in him lien.
The task of furnishing a corrective for derangements
of the paper medium, with us, is almost
inexpressibly groat. The power exerted
by the States to charter banking corporations,
and which, having boon carried to *
great excess, has filied the country
with, in most of the States, an irredeemabe
paper medium, is to evil
which, in some way or other, requires a corrective.
The rates at which bills of exchange
are negotiated between different parts of the
country furnish an index of the value of the
local substitute for gold and silvern which t*,
in manv parts, so far depreciated as not to be
received, except at a large discount, in payment
of debts or in the purchase of produce
It could earnestly be desired that every bank,
not possessing the means of resumption, shoukk
follow the example of the late United State*
Bank of Pennsylvania, and go into liquidation,
rather, than, by refusing to do so, to continue
embarrassments in the way of solvent institutions.

Whether this Government, with due regardi
to the righ'* of the Stares, has any power toconstrain
the banks either to resume specie
payments, or to force them into liquidation, m
an inquiry which will not fail to claim your'
consideration. In vie* of the great advantages
winch are allowed the corporators, not.
among the least of which id^the authority contained

to three times the amount of their capital,,
thereby often deriving throe times as much in

individual is permitted by law to receive, mr W
sufficient apology can be urged for a long
continued suspension of specie payments..
Such suspension is productive of the greatest
detriment to the public, by expelling from circulation
the precious metals, and seriously
hazarding the success of any effort that this
Government can make to increase commercial*
facilities and to advance the public interest*.
This is the more to be regretted, and the
indispensable necessity for a sound currency

on (he vast amount of the internal commerceof
the country. Oft.hrf? we have no statistics,
nor just data for'forming adequate opinion*
But there can h? no doubt but that the amount
of transportation coastwse by sea, and thetransportation
inland by railroads and C 'mls,
and by steamboats and other ra<?de8 of conveyance,
over the surface of our vast rivers
and immense Jakes, and the value of property
carried and interchanged by these means,,
form a general aggregate to which the foreign
commerce of the country, large as it is, makesbnt
a distant approach.
In the absence of any controlling power
over this subject, which, by forcing * general
resumption of specie paymenis, would at encp
have the effect of restoring a sound medium of
exchange, and would loave to the country but
little to desire, what measure of relief, falling
within the limits of our constitutional compos
tency, does it be become this Government to
adopt? It was my painful duty, at your last
session, under the weight of most solemn obv
ligations, to differ with Congress on the measures
which it proposed for my approval, and
which it doubtless regarded as corrective of
existing evils. Subsequent reflection, and
events since occurring, have only served to

mint be permitted to add, that no seheme
of governmental policy, unaided by individual
exertions, can be available for amelioratingthe
present condition of things. Commercial*
modes of exchango and a good currency arebut
the necessary means of commerce and in*
tercoorse, not the direct productive sources
of wealth. Wealth can nnly be accumulated (b
by the earnings of industry and the savings of .
frugality; and nothing can be more ill.judgsd
than to look to facilities in borrowing, or to a
redandant circulation, for the "power of die.

is full of resources, and the people ftiii of en*
