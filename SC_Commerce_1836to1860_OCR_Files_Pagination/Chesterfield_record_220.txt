"2* Liach harvest impoverishes the soil to

The cultivation of spindle or tap root?, J

3. It is necessary not to avoid returning ;

4. It is unwise to allow two kinds of

weeds among them, to be raised in succession.
5. Those plnnrs that derive Their princi

When the soil exhibits symptoms of exhaustion,
from successive harvests, the cultivation
of those plants which restore to the

that vicinity, informed us a few days since,1
thtt he saved at least one.third of his corn
by the manner in which he fed it out to his
horses. Uis plan is this;?He has two
hogsheads placed in his cellar, where they
ore secure from freezing. These he first
fills with corn in the ear, then puts in asuffi.
dent quantity of water to cover the corn.
After the ears have been thoroughly soak

hut twoMrds the usual quantity allow.,
ed. As one of these bogheads becomes
empty, ho refills it; and by the time the j
other is empty, the one last filled is sufficiently
soaked for- use. In this way the
cobs become so softened that the horses
-consume the whole of them, and they are
thus made to add fully one.third to Ins

Intur.nul Improvements.
Most of our sister Stales are engaged in j
magnificient schemes of improvement, of.
fering high wages to the mechanic and laborer,
whilst the South-West invites the
Farmer with her fertile paradise. Have l
we then arty bope, any alternative but in a j
continued and vigorous effort at general
improvement? We must ameliorate the
condition of our people, and wo must stimu- i
hie their home enterprizes or be content to i
lose with their wealth our better population, i
The system of improvements adopted by {
our last Legislature has given employment ]
to many, and a show of activity and busi- t

equally and obviously necessary to change t
the whole face of affairs, and give a new t
character to the Stute. t
ln~Ap<il of last year, the Wilmington and !
Raleigh Rail Road Company applied, <
agreeably to law, for the subscription of ;h? t
Stuto of2-5 of its capi!al. This 9ubscrip. i
tion was made by tho Board of Internal j i
Improvements and the first instalment was j t
paid. Since that period two other ius?tai- <
moots, the last in the past month of October ?.
have been claimed and paid, making the to- :
tal sum of four hundred and fifty thousand
dollars, paid by the State and on ihe part t
of individual subscription five hundred and i
sixty six thousand five hundred and eighty j (

exceedingly unpleasant to enforce pay- 1 th;
ments from individuals who had faithfully |
paid up 75 per cent, either by a sacrifice j tn
of l ho stock or of other property, and the ! ali
company will cer'ninly be driven to this al- j foj
lernative, which 1 am persuaded was neith. na
er the wish nor intention of the State, with- j ke
oui further legislative action. I would re- j pri
commend therefore, as an act of justice, the J wc
ynssn je of a Resolution instructing the ; bes
of Improve^er'stoM** Ter
forthwith to the company, the fourth instal- an
mont outofany funds in tlwir hands. st?
In patronizing this work, it was presumed \V
that the General Assembly intended to be 0c
governed by principles ol justice and iibor- inj
alitv. And it is upon these principles that R.
the Board of Ioternal Improvements have bt
regulated their intercourse with the com. tc?
pany. The work has beeu prosecuted is
with untiring vigor. Ninety miles of the lei
road are now in use and continued by sta- se
g?'s and steam boais of the best description, ly
so ss to afford an admirable route of travel- cc
ling from the Roanoke to Charleston. The th
remainder of the road is under contract and tn
will be completed next year. ac
* The other roads which were projected, a
and for which the General Assembly con- at
sented to subscribe a like proportion of the
m A ^ I L r. ?-> O nnllMltlAM ? tlm it
caprai, nnvt* iimuu iu> uuim mi mc m
State's subscription. The reason has never ar
been communicated to the Boar i of Intern- A
al Improvements, nor to the Executive. Ii ec
may be found, however, I presume, in the 0i
inability of the companies to 611 up the sub. m
scrip ions to the required amount, although ra
o one a considerable subscription was made, in
To the other, perhaps nothing. sr
Doubtless the citizens on the route of the se
Cape Fear and Yadkin Road, and those in- to
tercstcd in fs accomplishment, strained 2(
every nr I've to bring about so desirable a gt
consummation, and though not successfully,
still the merits of the route are not impaired,
and tho interest of the State, and particularlyof
its western section, demand, impe.
riously, its completion, to connect that rich jQ
and valuable interior with a market, and a
port within our own Sta'e. At my par- s{j
tieul ir request, Major McNiell, the chief
engineer, who surveyed the routes 01 the Jr
Cape Pear and Yadkin Road, favored me j.,
with a s'ght of his report, which proved not
only the practicability of constructing the ^
road, but at a cost which can be remunerated
to the proprietors. I would, therefore,
rerommpnd a renewal of the charter, impowering
the Board of Internal Improve- m
ments to subscribe on the part of the Shale, ^
for three-fifths, or even if necessiry, threefourths
of the stock, so ns to insure the ac- g(
comphshment of the work. Nay?so im- jc
portant do I consider it, that I had said for
all the stock, if necessary, but for the para- ja]
mount necessity of associating with the ?
Stat\ interested and judicious citizens to ja|
superintend the details, and attend to tho jj,
execution of the work, which is certainly
within the means of the State, probably ?
without the necessity of borrowing. Should
the Bank to which x have referred, be put
in operation, and make to this road the sub- 0
scription of hilfa million dollars, and should ??
the fourth instalment of the surplus be re. a
ceived in January next, which is probable, 8U
as tho law directing the distribution has not
been repealed, amounting to 8477,919 13 I
cent*, with the proceeds of the sales of the cu
Cherokee lands, say 8350,000 being np. Vfl
propraled to this purpose, with what indi. 0
visual subscription may bo obtained, the Pr'
funds would lie providod. It appears to cu
n e as a matter of right and justice, to give !
the proceeds of the Cherokee land sales to j 01
opening a communication to that section of an
the State whence thev have been derived. wc

There are oilier works of no less impor. tance,
in which I had almost said the salva.
tion of the State requires that she should
promptly and vigorously engage. On our
west on effort is making by South Carolina |
fo cross our State Dy a ran way, 10 secure .
to Charleston the produce of that fertile re- pC
gion, whilst the establishment of her South .
Western Bank?with a Branch in our iimits,
not only insures the success of the first u r
en:erpt ize, but by superceding the circula- ^
tionof our Banks, dcstro}'es our currency,
and controls our credit system. The lan?uage
of the friends of this Twelve Million ^
Bank, is "that it will be to the South Wes- 'sc
:ern States in currency and exchanges, s?r
.vhat the Bank of the United States was to T\"
J.e Union.'* Sould Sou h Carolina sueifed
in carrv ing out her views as to the cur ency,
and as to a South Western Confeder- tlor
tcy (or league) our fears cannot be boun-1 disi
led by mere pecuniary loss. We should ' tun
ae driven to trade with Charleston, and to j ('h<
ihCiish sectional feelings until our attach- J off
nents lo the Union itself would become out
mpaired. We cannot serve two masters int
vith equal fidelity and attachment. Should for<
io counteracting measures be adopted on sou
>ur part, 1 should fear that she would sue- wai
;eed both in directing our trade and super- pov
>eding our currency. cut!
The Bank 1 have proposed would remove in tl
he latter apprehension, and to remedy the let.
"ormer, I would respectfully propose the '
tonstruction of a Rail Roid from the head 0f <

Improvement in the eastern sectioJi of

'Col. Kearney, United States Engineer,
ho has recently had charge of a survey of

at to render it fit for cultivation, it requires

his defect in a country where land so
uch abounds and capital is so limited, has
;en the cause of its neglect.
The difficulty of the navigation of t
>und and of the outlet to the ocean is no
lubt a superadded cause, but, remove
ese: and there is no doubt, that these
ads will become the garden spot of the
ate instead of a wilderness of worthless
ad and a fertile source of pestilence and
seesc.
Nagshead, at the foot of the Abcrmale
>und, seems designed by nature for the
it'et. It is formed by a very narrow strip i
beach, which divides the sound from the
ean, and which is of very little elevation
tovo high water mark. It has often been
rveyed by very distinguish engineers,
d for the practicability of opening it, I
g to refer to their reports. The very cirmstarcc
of its having been ho often suryed,
and so often alluded to as the subject
improvement, proves the value and the
acticabiiity of the enterprize. It is diffi.
It to explain w hy it has not before ooeo
dertaken. The reason may perhapa be J
itid in its magnitude as a State work,
d to the impression that it should and
?uld be executed by the general govern.
?nft as coming property within the class j j
works belonging to it. It is now too
jenfial to us, to be longer delayed, and 1
ist be accomplished by some power.
Nagshead is greatly more eligibly situtd
for an outlet, if Croaton Sound was ^
ised, than was the new inlet on the Cupe
or, which was opened within the tecol- ^
tion of persons now living, and has |
eady 14 feet water and gradually im>ving.

The Albermarle and tributaries, probably t
charge five times the quantity of water

rhe Cape Fear pursued a similar direc.

ned off less abruptly and found an outlet n

a storm washed over the beach and cut p
the new inlet; The Croaton Sound
treepts the water and draws it away be- p

Mr. Adams offered the following resolu-1 hi
is: . 111
Resolved, That a committee of ; o
rob"rs fy1 anpoi'Ved, w:th lean* to send : m
for persona and papers, to inquire and report
to this House?
1st. Whether Andrew Stevenson, En.
voy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipoten.
tiary from the United States at London, is
or has recently been engaged in a public
newspaper controversy involving his per.
sonal integrity and tne honor ofthiscountry,
whose representative he is, wiih Daniel
O'Connell, a member of the Parliament
of the United Kingdom of Great Britian
and Ireland 1
2d. Whether the said Andrew S:even.
son, holding the privileged character of an
Ambassador, has io concert with three other
persons, citizens of the Un ted States,
one of whom an officer in their Navy, engaged
in a conspiracy with intent to slop
the wind, or, in the language of the laws
of God and of man to murder the said Daniel
O'Connell in a duel, or by a premediatcd
provocation to a brawl.
3J. Whether the said Andrew Stevenson,
after a written demand of explanation
in the form usual among duelists as preliminary
to a challenge, and with the intent to
follow it up by a challenge, preconcerted
with the said three other citizens of the United
State*, did accept of an answer from
the said Daniel O'Connell equally unsatisfactory
to the codes of genuine and of spu.
rious honor, and thereby tacitly admit the
truth of the amputation upon his honor, at
which he had professed to take offence.
4th. Whether the said Andrew Stevenson
in these transactions, has violated the
duties of his office as an ambassador of
peace, the laws of nations, and the laws of
the land to the Government of which he was
accredited, the privileges of the British
House of Commons in the person of one of
its members, and the honor and interest of
his own country.
5th. Whether the said Andrew Sevenson
has, in these transactions, so conducted
himself as to require the consiitutional interposition
of this [louse by impeachment
or otherwise.
Monday Dec. 10.?A message was
received from the President relating to
the Smithsonian legacy stating that the
money had been received and invested in
State stocks, and recommending that steps
be taken to fulfil the object of the bequest
The message was, on motion of Mr.
Adams, refjred to a select commiitee of

A resolution previously introduced by
Mr. Droomgoole, to change the rules of the
House so that all elections shall be by
ballot was taken up, and a debate of some ,
length arose upon it. Mr. Wise opposed
it as measure designed to put the party i
screws to doubtful members, and compel
them to vote against their judgment or forfeit
the favor of a political party. Mr Droomgoole
advocated it on the ground of the Democratic
principle of responsibility to the
constituent body" Messrs Robertson, Jenifer
and Morris. It was opposed by Messrs
Pickens, Pearce, Tillinghast, Sergeant and
Stanly. The arguments of some of th? rr?
and particularly of Mr. Sergeant, also ad i
vocated it to the point were as
well as to the times. But we have not room
for them. The remarks, for tbey were not
arguments, of those who advocated the
resolution were like much of the slang spoken
and written now o'days full of profes~ j
sion love to the dear people. After the !
debate had lasted, as the House thought 5
long enough, it was ended by the previous 1
question and the resolution adopted, 1J6 to
88.
Abolition of Slavery. ^
Dec. 11. Mr. Atherton of Maine moved
,
the following resolutions.
Mr. ATHERTON rose and asked leave, 1
at this time, to off r the following resolutions,
which were read for the information
of I he House c
Resolved, That this Uovernment is a t
Government of limited powers, and that, by a
the Constitution of the United States, Congress
has no jurisdiction whatever over the s
institution of slavery in the several States of 1
the Confederacy. g
Resolved, that the petition for the abolition
of slavery in the District of Columbia s
and the Territories of the United States, /
and against the removal of slaves from one \
State to another, are a part of the plan of
operations set on foot to affect the institution b
of slavery in the several Slates, and thus 1
indirectly to destroy that institution within S
their limits.
Resolved, That Congress has no right to C
do that indirectly which it cannot do direct- o
ly ; and that the agitation of the subject of A
slavery in the District of Columbia, or the
Territories, as a means, and with a view of C
disturbing or ovetthrowing that institution C
in the several States, is against the true I
spirit and meaning of the Constitution, an
infringement of the rights of the States affec- F
ted, and a breach ot the public faith on F
which they entered iuto the Confederacy. F
Resolved, That the Constitution rests on
lite broad principle of equality among the members
of this Confederacy, and that Con- ti
gross, in the exercise of its acknowledged V

look to state reasons for his request to he
excused, which the rules allow ; but he was
several times called to order by the speaker,
