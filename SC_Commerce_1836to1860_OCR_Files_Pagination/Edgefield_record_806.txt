Mr. Tyler moved that the Committee
on Ejections be appointed by the gentle
me: [Mr. Beardsly] then temporally oc
cupyingthe Speaker's Chair. This motion,
after considerable debate, was agreed to.
- Several Executive comnumcations
were presented to the House, and ordered
to'be printed : and then.
On motion by Mr.. Weller, the House

WASHINGTON, Dec. 10.
Neither House of Congress was in ses
sion on Friday or Saturday. In the
meantime we have Shad the documents ac
companying the President's Message to
ponder upon. The reports of the several
heads of Departnents appear to give sa
tisfaction. The War and Navy Depart.
meats appear. to be adniitiistered with
more regard to economy and efficiency
than heretofore. A great reform was
needed in these branches of the.public ser
vice and has been, at least, partially, ob
tained. As to the general Post Office,
that machine will lumber along for a while
longer, till it comes to a stand still for want
of and funds. The report throws cold wa
ter on any substantial reform. It calls for
the enforcement of laws and regulations
which are obvious and inconvenient to the
public, and, threrefore, impracticable. A
reduction of rates of postage to nearly the
same amount in decimal coins cannot keep
the "mail matter" in the inails, on the
great route, through the country. The
members of Congress from the interior
are even opposed to any measures which
are belied to be for the benefit of the At
).antic Cities, and the- erroneous notion
that the reduction of postage is a measure
in which these Cities are chiefly interested,
appears to prevail not only with the Post
master General, but with Congress.
The nomination of Mr. Porter, as Se
cretaryof War, Mr. Henshaw, as Secreta
ry of the Navy, and of Mr. Nelson, as At
torney General, were sent into the Sen
ate on Thursday last, but too late to be
opened or acted on. The gentlemen who
are the nominees are exceedingly anxious
to have their cases decided upon, forth
with. How long the majority of the Sen
-ate will keep them in suspense is doubtful.
The chance for the confirmation of Mr.
Porter's nomination has never been sup
posed to be very good. "The Porter in
terest" (so called in Pennsylvania) is ex
ceedingly unpopular with both parties,
in and out of that Commonwealth. So.
if he should go through. it may be esteein
ed an act of most -extraordinary forbear
and, on the part of the Senate.
The conduct of the old hunkers here,
which nothing can account for but destiny
-has secured Van Buren's nomination,
by means that will reader his defeat equal
ly certain as his nomination. The over
bearing and oppressive course of the Van
Buren majority in the organization of the
House, has disgusted a great number -of
members, who still submit to their screw.
The Calhoun party being no longer fear
ed, 'are tiow to be persecuted, by a tyran.
ical majority. Their overtures for "har
mony" are jreated as disdainfully as were
Mr. Tyler's. They think themselves
strong enough to dispense with the aid and
"harmony"-tbus -.proffered. They may
find themselves mistaken. -

THE PRESiDENT'S MESSAGE.
The great length of this doeniment, renders
it impossible for us to puiblish it, without ex
cluding much matterl'rom onrcolumnis, includ
ing some advertisemer~ts. which, in omlitting,
would be doing injustice to our patrons; and
we have also thought that a- cursory synopsis
of the Message would he as acceptable to our
raders, as the entire document..
- 1. Th President commences with the usual
acknowledgement to a kind Providence, for
the nuinerous blessings bestowed upon our
whole country,.which we regard as proper and
right, and hope.%Mr. Tyler-was influenced by
proper motis, 'in making such an acknow
ledgement; but the truth is, that it has become
so fashionable at the present day,' for public'
men to render thanks to the Shpmreme'Bemng,
-for his parental care and protection, writh a
~viwv of gining popularity withi the, Christian
comnrunity, generally, thit we scarcely lenow'
~whn such acknowledgements, are genuine.
We..do not pretend to say that.Mr. Tyler--is
oneff this class, but on the contrary we hope
he ienxot. '
2. A brief allusion is made to the late treaty
between this eountry and Great Britain, which.
continues to icarried out in good faithi, and
which has prore'd mutually advantageous to
both countries.
3. Ins relat~on. to tbe Qregon Territory, the
President states, that the territoriarl limits of the
e~ caantrie.still ,eainin dspune .k'. our.
Minister at the Court of St. James, has been
directed to bring the-subject before the British
Government for' an adjustment. Asyetnothing
definite has been done. The PreAident repeats
his recommendations for the establishment of
military posts on the line of travel for the pro
tection of our hardy adventurers, against hos
tiletribesof Indians.
4. The British Government have agreed to
make an indemnity for several vessels captured
and detained on the coast of Africa.
5. The interruptions of our citizens engaged
in the Fisheries on the coast of Nova. Scotia,
has been represented to the British. Govern
ment by the Exrcutive,,but no:definite answer
has as yet been received.
6. The higher duty imposed on American
over African Rice, when imported in England,
has been brought,to the notice of the British
Government, as not in compliance. with the
the Treaty of July, 1815, but no redaction has
yet taken place.
7th. Our relations with all foreign powers
continue to be mostfriendly,
8. The Germanic Association of Customs
and Commerce,.founded in 1833, offers to our
commerce, greater facilities that any other fo
reign power. Cotton is admitted free of duty,
and Rice at a low rate. This Association has
also evinced a disposition to reduce. upon cer
tain conditions, their present duty on Tobacco.
It embraces a population of 27,000.000.
9. The Government of Mexico has express
ed its determination, in case Texas should be
annexed to the United States, to consider it a
declaration of war. The President recommends
that Congress should be firm and decided in all
acts where Mexico is concerned. The instal
ments on claims due this Government from
Mexico, recently adjusted. have been prompt.
ly paid.
10. The President recommends that a Min
ister be sent to Buenos Ayres, and that otr re
lations with that Government be renewed.
II. No efforts have been spared in persuad.
ing the Indian tribes to continue at peace with
each other, and these efforts have been crown
ed with favorable success.
12. The receipts into the Treasury -for the
year 1843, have been $18,000,000
The expenditures exclusive of
Public Dubt, 23,000 000
Deficiency. 5,000 000
The Loans and Treastiry Notes issued before
the close of the last seision, were not quite ad.
equate to meet the deficiency. And, notwith
standing, on the 1st of October, there Was a
balance of over three millions in the Treasury,,
yet the appropriations, which had previously
been made, would absorb that balance, and
leave a probable deficiency of over two mil
lions. There are outstanding Treasury Notes
to the amount of four millions sir hundred
thousand dollars, to be redeemed, which will
require new provisions for their redemption.
The loan of over five-millions. will fall due on
the first of January next, must be provided for
by a new loan. The deficiency at the close of
the fiscal year 1843, will be over four millions
of dollars.
13. The President says the extravagant is
sne of paper currency has been succeeded by
a sound metalic issue, which has caused a di.
minished importation, and consequently a fal
ling off in revenue. This deficiency has com
pelled a resort to the issue of Treasury Notes,
and finally funding the same, thus creating a
permanent debt, which in time of peace is
greatly to be regretted. It is not anticipated
that there will be any increase of the ievenue
from the sale of the Public Lands, but this re
venue will always strengthen the credit of the
Governmenmt.
14. The President congratulates the country
on the restoration of Public credit, as a proof
of which, he says that Government Sixes have
rasedl to twenty per cent. premium. Should
a revision of the present Tariff the necessary,
he recommends moderation on all sides, to se
cure permaniency.
15. Next follows a recapitulation by the
President. of the reasons which induced him at
the previous session to recommend the issue of
Treasury Notes to the amount of fifleen mil
lions of the denomination of five to two hun
dred dollars, redeemable in specie, at different
points, and which met with no favor from
Congress. And. although circumstances have
since arisen, which makes the plan less neces.
ary, yet ho still thinks that some mitch project
will be required. As there has been no expres
sion by the people against tihe measure, he
again presses it on the attention of Congress.
16. in relation to the War Department the
Executive suggests that this arm of the
National defence be strengthened and increas
ed. With regard to the Navy he speaks
more at length, by referring Congress to the
recommendations relative to steam power,. the.
loss of the U. 8- Steamship Missouri. and the
aid rendered by the British on that ocasion at
Gibralter. As to the Post Office Department
the President admits that there may be some
reform, particularly in the franking privilege,
yet he thinks that the Department has been
conducted with great energy. He piasses coin
mendatipna on all the varions departments of
the Government.
17. The President closes bf alluding to the
continued prosperity of the country; the tide
of emigration settling west; the protection of
the Western Lakes and harbors; the- necessity
of a system of government for die District of
Columbia; the protection of the Smithsonian
bequest, and a recapitulation 'of all advanta
ges that have been accomplished during his
administration.
Thie above is a glance-at tihe differnt topics
hich appear most prominent in the Message.
We consider it on the whole, quite a respec
table document. Its tone, in general is good,
making- allowances for the self-laudationat its
close. But this is one of Mr. Tyler's failings,
and therefore, cannotbe helped.
. CorauxarA, Dec. .13, 1843.
Daar Sir.-Asi the close of the session ap
proaches its business accumulates, and their
seems to be a general disposition .to facilitate
every important mreasure proposed for-its con
sideation; several constitutional measures,
such as limiting the tenure of the office of
Judgerhip, to the age of sixty-five, and'limiting
the power of the Legislature to contract debt,
have received the constitiltionl majority in.
the House, and have been sent to the Senate,.
and in all probability.will passihat body; there
has been a bill introduced into the House to
cross-examine defendants in the Courts of
Equity, this has excited -some very animated
discussions on the whole Equity system, and
will likely lead to some radical change. The
Free. School system,. has also been under dis
cession, and has illicited some excellent speak
ing; the proposition before the House was the
subtraction of . twenty dollars from every three
hundred dollars now appropriated to the Free
School system, to constitute a salary for a Su
perintendant to travel over the State and ex
amine the Free Schools, and report to the next
Legislature the result of his enquiries; this,
however, was rejected by a strong vote in the
House. There has been quite an animated
debate upon a bill to change the name of the
Charleston, Cincinnati and Louisville Rail
Road, and South Carolina Canal and Rail
Road Company, into the South Carolina Rail
Road Company, they also wished the right to
build Bridges from the Hamburg side to the
Augusta side of the Savannah river, so as to
unite with the Georgia Rail Road; the hill al
so provided that the Act of'41 in regard to char.
erised companies should not operateag ainst
them. The debate upon this question contin.
ned for two or three hours, Col. Memminger,
Northrop,. Davie, Rhett, and Palmer, were the
principal speakers. The result was a passage
of the bill, with the exception of the clause
giving them the power to construct Bridges
across the Savannah, at Hamburg. The bill to
limit the tenure of the Judgeship has passed the
Senate by a vote of 30 to 12, so that this bids
fair to become a part of the Constitution of the
State. It is rumored that Judge Richardson
will resi"n his seat in consequence of the pas
sage oftTis bill. We had on Tuesday a flashy
and exciting debate -, a hill to legitamize two
persons named Eubanks, of Barnwell; the
bill was defended by Ashly and Wilson, and
opposed by Frost, and others; the bill wai
finally lost by a very strong vote of the House,
which indicates a correct and elevated sensibil
ity in our Legislature to sustain the virtuous
community against the unbridled propensities
of the vicious.
The bill to elect an extra Judge came up for
consideration to-day (Tuesday,) the principal
debaters were Meziming-r and Jos. Black for.
and Sims, Hunt, and King against the bill;
the matter was disposed of by a vote of27 in
favor, and 83 against it. Mr. WalkerofChares
ton has introduced sundry resolutions in regard
to Texas. which after being road, were ordered
to be printed, and they remain to he consider
ed; this postponement was advised, upon the
consideration that the course of the President
would be indicated in his message, and on that
account we should not be premature in our
muvenment. Some few days ago, a Special
Committee upona resolution of the House was
made appointed to report a bill to chance the
practice in the Courts of Equity, so as to give
the plaintiffs the right of cross-examining the
defendants in open Courts. This question eli.
cited the most interesting debate that has trans
pired this session, Messrs Memminger and
Sims against, and Messrs. H unt and Henry in
favor of the bill. Memminger wurned the
House against this whole measure in one ofthe
most eloquent and powerful speeches which
has been delivered this session; he, in fact,
took the House by storm, although opposed'by
two ofthe ablest men in the House, and a strong
feeling against him, yet he demolished the ar
guments of his opponents, and turned the tde
against the bill, which was finally killed by
postponing it to the first day of January. I can
not speak too highly ofthe iestimable value of
the services of 0ol. Memminger as a legislator;
his course is open, and always directed by the
high principler of disinterested patriotism.
The anti-duelling law was brought up this
day (Wednesday) but was rejected, not re
ceiving two thirds; a bill to increase the pow.
ers of the Ordinary has, after much discussion
and snudry amendments passed the House;
this bill was introduced by Mr. Black of Abbe
ville, and will be orgreat advantage to small
estates. The bill for a new Judicial District
in Edgefield, come up for consideration to-day,
and after some remarks from Dr. Griffin, Mr.
Palmer moved, that all after the enacting clause
ho struck out; this was intended to test the
seuseof the H ouse upon the question;thebill was
lost, having however, a very strong vote in its
favor, Some im portanit changes in a Road
Bill, has passed the H ouse, one of themr is giv
tug the Cormmissioners power to issue a Capias
ad Satisfacientdum where there is a nulls bona
returned by the Sheriff. There is now a dis
cussion going on in regard to a constitutional
amendment, so as to give one day only for the
General Elections-I do not think this can suc
ceed- The bill has been lost by a vote of 75 to
to 37-not having a constitutionial majority.
I am, very sincerely, yours, &c.

COrUMxiu, Dec. 14, 1843.
Dear Sir.-In the House of Representativas
we had quite an animating discussion on a bill
to inicrease the Magistaies jnrisdiction to fifty
d ollars. It ivas indeed amusing to hear the ar
guments urged by both the frienids and oppo
nents of the bill, all of whom seem to take the
interest of the poor ma, as they said, into cot'
sideration; the friends urging the passage cfI
the bill, as it was calculated to relieve the griev
ance under which a large majority of the peo
ple was coniplaining , the opponents to the bill
argued that the passage of the hill, instead rof
afodn any relief to the people, would in
crease litigation, and be the means of produc
ing greater distress and mischief, than arty thing
before the Legislature, but upon the passage
of the bill, or rather tihe question of sending the
bill to the Senate, almost every Laseyer voted

entitled an act, more effectually to prevent 4ee
negroes, and persons of color, from entering

House adjourhed, the Clerk called the roll,
when the Speaker took the chair, a quorum
being present, the Journals of yesterday's pro
ceedings wass read; a message was. received
from the Senate, and referred to the committee
on Roads, Bridges and Ferrys, on the propriety
of publishing in pamphlet form. all the actsin
relation to the .Commispioners of Roads. The
Senate. returned to the House a bill establishing
an Inspection, and Warehouse in Hamburg,
Edgefield district, which was read atthird time

the Senate and. taken up for the third reading,
the title.changed to.an act. The House have
disposed of all the important bills, and will have
nothing to do on Monday. and Tuesday next,
but hear the different reports of committees,
ard consider the resolutions offered by Mr.
Walker of Charleston, .in relation to the an
neation of Texas to the Union; these resolu
tions will create considcrable discnssion. Mr.
H unt, I understand, will take ground against
them,. but the seneec of the House is decidedly
in ravor of the resoltutions. The members are
extremely anxions to get. home. most of them
seem (from present appearances) perfect ly sa
tisfied with legislation, and probably. not half
will be candidates for re-election. The hour
having arrived for closing the Edgefield marl,

Yours respectfully, ... -
CoLUMBIu, Dec.16.
Dear Sir.-Having determined to remain
miil the close of the eessionl.on account of the
"Grand Debate," which is :expected to . come
off on Monday or Tuesday. on the resolutions
offered by Mr. Walker, of Charlestorn, relative
to the aninexation'of Texas to the Union, I will
merely give you a few of the ott dits of the Past
week.
The Senate and House have worked fast,
I should say, like a journeyman mechaniic
who was hurrying off his work " by the piece,''
and not as generally done by our Congress and
Legislature, '- by-lhe-day," or oii the old "siz
hotr systenm." they have stuck too it manfully,
ad from whit I can learn, have nearly work
ed themselves out of buuiness, whether for, or
against the inti-rests of their constituients, I will
not pretend toi say; one of the hills that have
been given the go bye, and by which,, our up
country citizens would have be'en benefittcd,
was a bill to eitend the Magistrates jurisdiction
to fift dollars, it caiused considlerable debatein
the Hone, 'ad I~as'inj'reat' hopeit woufd
have passed, but it hiad to carry too. great a
wight. (as we jockies ay,) that is, it would
take lots of srali but prjable .cask bhusiness
ot of the Emaes)5hanid therefore it could inot
be expeted that thioietoorthies would any more
stand syach an encroachment upon their rights,
than'that the Southernoi: e wduld stand the
present Tariff, as at man (dtou'gha legislator)
ought not to be-crpe t o sacrifice his owe
interest entirelf,-to seree his constituents.
