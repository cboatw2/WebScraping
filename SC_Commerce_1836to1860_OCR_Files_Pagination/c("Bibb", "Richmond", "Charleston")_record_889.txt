OBITUARY.
“Bletsed are the dead who die in the Lord."
For tho Southern Christian Advocate.
Died, in Wilmington, N. C., on the 29th No
vember, 1844, Mrs. Helen Priscilla Pickett.
The deceased was the daughter of Edward and
Sarah Conner, and was born in Horry dist., S. C.,
May 18, 1808. Her parents ,were respectable
memlmrs of the Baptist Church. She was mar
ried November 13, 1823, to Mr. J. W. Pickett,
and settled in the county of New Hanover, N, C.
At a camp-meeting held in Columbus county about
18 years ago, she sought and obtained redemption
through the merits of her Saviour, even the for
giveness of sins, having joined the Methodist E.
Church about three years previously.
Some three years since, her health began to de
cline, but flattering hupes were entertained till
about six months ago, when the consumption
which terminated her life, became marked and
manifest. The last hours of our departed sister,
were her brightest and her best. Her death was
strikingly triumphant. ‘ Wholly unappalled by the
appearance of death, she professed a sure and
good hope of an inheritance in heaven ; and hav
ing committed her husband, children and servants
entirely to the care of her Heavenly Father, she
calmly awaited the moment of her release. When
dying, she raised her hand in token that all was
, well, according to a promise made to her husband
long before.
^'befriends who witnessed her departure con
cw in representing it to have been a most inter
esting and precious privilege. She spoke to them
all with great composure, assuring them of the
all-sufficiency of her Saviour even in a dying hour.
Thus “ death was swallowed op in victory.”
December, 1844.
Died, in Glennviile, Ala., January 23, 1845,
Gabriel B. Tbvetlin, formerly of Cokesbury,
S. C. In alt true biography the “ lights ami
•hades” of the character should be given together,
for absolute perfection is unattainable by mortals
such as we are : upon this principle, if 1 were to
give a full history of our beloved and departed
brother, the narrative would be varied as in all
human character. But if the individual is said to
be a good or bad citizen, in proportion as one or the
Other preponderates, no one would hesitate to pro
nounce the subject of this notice, a decidedly
good and worthy member of society. He was
ever modest in his claims to the excellencies of
the man, or Christian, but those who knew him
well, saw much to challenge the approbation of
the wise, virtuous and good. As a master he was
indulgent' almost to a fault, as a husband and
father, he was remarkably kind and affectionate.
The welfare of his family was the centre of his
thoughts and desires, and to it he directed his
best efforts. As a neighbour lie was kind and
obliging, as a citizen generally ho was obedient to
the laws, and used all his influence to promote
good order and peace in society, and truly it may
be said of him, “ if an honest man be the noblest
work of God,” he was eminently bo. Brother
Truetlin had been many years an acceptable mem
ber of the M. E. Church. As a Christian, he was not
characterized by those strong marks of warm zeal,
and sensible religious enjoyment which belong to
many. He was naturally modest and quiet in his
disposition, which probably had an influence on
his visible Christian character. In his last illness,
which continued about ten days, there was no
- danger apprehended until a day or two before his
death. It was announced to him that he could
live but a few hours longer, which he received
with perfect composure, and commenced immedi
ately and calmly to give instructions about his
business with as much self-possession as if he
Were about to make a short journey ; not the least
change was visible in his countenance, and it really
seemed that “death was swallowed up in victory.’’
Although brother T. was not favoured with that
bright and glowing evidence that Jesus was near
fae expressed himself as having no fear of death,
and on being further interrogated with regard to
the foundation of that indifference to the King ot
terrors, be replied that he relied upon the merits
of Christ. He charged his wife and children with
5 his “ latest breath," to be decided Christians and
meet him in heaven. He has left a wife and
•even children to wend their devious way through
life, without a paternal head to direct them. May
God prove them “ a husband to the widow, and
• father to the fatherless.” Virgil Bobo.
Died, on the 24th January, in Georgetown dis*
trict, Mr. Andrew B. Jayroe, aged 53. Mr.
Jayroe was a man though esteemed by his ac
quaintances, yet to know his intrinsic value an
intimate association was necessary. In his man
ners, he was urbane .and interesting: his conduct
and social intercourse with his fellow men was
•ever characterised by strict fidelity, and a high
estimate of “ the noblest work of God,” an honest
,. man. He was an exemplary member of the
Methodist E. Church for sixteen years, and though*
4he external signs of religion were not as manifest
•in him as in some others, few persons will ever
feel disposed to doubt the sincerity of his profes
sions, or that his every act was not performed by
the dictates of a heart purely Christian. The loss
hf all good men must ever be a source of regret to
' those who are connected with them, in proportion
to their usefulness.—How mucn tne ae&in oi sucn
a man a* ihe subject of this brief notice will be,
remained yet to be fully known. He left not an
enemy, so far as we are acquainted.
" None knew him but to lore him,
None named him but to praise.”
For sereral years he had been an almost constant
sufferer from chronic inflammation of the liver,
which finally terminated his life. A wife and four
children are left. But they mourn only for that
which was mortal—which sustained the relation
of husband and father; for they have the most
undoubted evidence that his immortal spirit is
reposing with the God that gave it. H. L. B.
MISCELLANY.
BUFFALO.
The Editor of the Northern Christian Advo
cate of Auburn, lately visited Buffalo. He
gives us the following description of the town,
and some Interesting particulars of the storm
which swept over the place last summer.
The winter season in Buffalo is their respite
from business, as that depends a great deal upon
the navigation of the lakes and canal. To form
some idea of the amount of business done here
in the business season, it is only necessary to re
mind the reader that at that period, Buffalo is a
port of entry for forty steamboats—that the
amount of her tonnage is greater than the port
of Boston—that 300 vessels navigate lake Erie,
and that in the past year 64,000 travellers by the
cars alone, have passed through this city. The
town juts down quite to the water, having the
canal and the Niagara river on the West, and the
harbor formed by the outlet of Buffalo creek, on
the South, while just beyond the creek, still
farther South and South-West, the broad expanse
of lake Erie, spreads out before the eye in majesty
and beauty. The harbor is protected from the
violence of lake winds and waves by the dyke or
pier. But this was not sufficient in the time of
the late tremendous gale. There was something
awfully peculiar in that gale: the wind which
had been blowing from the land for a day or
two with great force, thereby driving the water
from the harbor and accumulating it in the
remoter sections of the lake, suddenly veered
about, and by the double force of the tempest,
and the reaction of the accumulated volume,
moved the waves of the lake towards the city
like the rushing Current of a mighty river, and
it swept all before it. It rolled over the sea-wall
as though it were a thing of nought, an<^poured
its wide-spread inundations into all the lower
parts of the city.
It was this unwonted suddenness ot the deluge,
and the fact of its occurring inf the dead of the
night that rendered it so awfully destructive to
property and life. We saw a score or more of
canal boats still lying high and dry far from
their proper element. Among the rest, the iron
steamboat, the Revenue Cutter. A merchant in
one of the principal streets, showed us the high
water mark in his store: it was well toward the
top of his writing desk; he lost in his store about
$3000 worth of goods. Entire brick buildings
were by the force of the wind razed to the
ground. We saw the cottage, out of which the
family made their escape, but a moment before
the battlements of an adjoining brick house were
blown down upon it and stove in the roef. We
were pointed to Huff’s Hotel, quite a distance
up Main St. where the two females were drowned
in their beds in the basement. But the most
awful destruction of human life, occurred on the
low grounds along the harbor and along the
Erie canal.
On the evening in which the gale came on,
there were in those quarters, several of the resi
dences of the poorer classes standing, of which
the next morning, there was not a vestige to be
found, either of house or tenants! There was
one case of a man and his family, residing in the
western limits, near the brick-furnace, which in
substance we will relate:
A man’s wife and children, three in number,
w^re all drowned in his own house and in his
presence. We became the more interested in
the case from having been shown their new
made graves in Mount Hope, in the Potter’s
Field, whither they had been brought and buried
at the instance of the woman’s friends who re
side in Rochester. Brother Seager, who per
formed their funeral ceremonies in that place,
showed us the four graves, one long and three
short ones, all side by side. When in Buffalo,
we took considerable pains to visit the house in
which the catastrophe occurred. It is a small
low white cottage with two principal rooms
without chamber or garret. It stands upon
piles, and there aTc two others just like it stand
ing in the same manner close by.
The family’s name was Smith. They were
respectable people, recently from Troy, N. Y.,
where they had been members of the Methodist
E. Church. Mr. S. labored in the furnace.
At about eleven o’clock they were aroused from
their sleep by the violence of the gale, and found
that a considerable depth of water was spread
around their house and over the flat. Still as
thev knew this had occurred often before, thev
were not particularly alarmed. In a short
time, however, they perceived the water coming
into the house. Now they saw their peril, but
it was too late to make their escepe. The fami
ly consisted of the man, his wife, a little girl
about eight or nine years old, and two small
boys younger. As the water rose in the room,
Mr. S. placed the family first on the table. The
tide still rising, so as to drive them from that
position, he elevated the bed upon his bureaus,
which again afforded a temporary retreat for his
wife and children, and brought them with their
heads quite up to the ceiling of the chamber
floor; the water was then, perhaps, about up to
his arm pits. He had thus far preserved his
lights, and had deposited his matches in a dry
place, and had no new calamity befallen them,
would probably have saved his family. But at
this juncture, by the combined force of the waves
and wind, which was blowing all the time like a
tornado, one of the adjoining houses, driven
violently against Smith's house, pushed it off
from its slight foundations to the ground. This
sudden motion threw the family from their place
of retreat into the water, (which now rose of
course two or three feet higher in the house,)
and extinguished the lights. ‘‘There," said the
mother, as she found herself sliding into water,
“ there, we are all gone." Smith sprang upon
a window-stool and thus kept his head above the
water, but in the darkness and terror of the hour
saved none of them but his little girl. Holding
on upon the top of the window-frame with one
hand, with the other he reached about, grasped
this child and drew her upon his shoulder.
After standing in this position an hour, clinging
with his fingers to the narrow hold of the upper
window-frame, which jutted only half an inch
from the plastering, a violent surge from without
stove in the window, blind and all, and washed
the child from his neck into the interior of the
room. Nearly helpless himself, he gave up the
child for lost, but soon felt the little creature pul
ling at his coat skirts. He reached down and
again draw hsr to his neck. * She cried,
auu Having nommg on out ner mgnt areas,
complained of the cold. “ Don’t cry, my child,”
■aid the agonized father, “ you sec how it is, I
can get nothing to put over you." “ Well, pa,"
said she, “ I’ll not cry any more."—These were
her last words, now almost lifeless, soon a cur
rent from the other direction carried her out of
the window into the raging flood. The father
grasped after her as she went, caught her dress,
but it left only a torn remnant in his hand. Un
able longer to keep his position he too was
borne out of the window, but caught about the
eaves of the house, and was found at daylight
lying upon the roof, his feet braced in the cave
trough, and having scarcely the breath of life
remaining. We need not say that he is a
broken-hearted man. Yet he derives comfor
from the reflection that his family are all in
heaven. His wife was pious. Her last hour
was spent in commending herself and her family
to the grace of God. He says he desired muen
tfesave his little girl, but feels that as the pious
mother that was to instruct his children is gone
fo heaven, it is well that they have all gone with
her. But what a night was that! What a
scene did this man pass through I It was at the
dusk of evening as we left the place; and as we
turned to take a last look at the scene, the cir
cumstances were well calculated to impress it
upon the mind. Darkness was beginning to
throw its melancholy tinge over the place, and a
threatening cloud was spreading itself over the
western sky; a strong cold wind was howling
gloomily around us; and the loud hoarse roar
of the waves that lashed the shore of the contigu
ous lake, completed the gloominess of the pic
ture, and impressed upon our mind vividly the
horrors this family must have endured on the
doleful night of the catastrophe!—We had
thought we knew what afflictions were: but we
do not think so now. Ye that repine under
slight grievances, think of this case and murmur
no more. Ye that dote on this world’s happi
ness, learn from this narrative what a world ye
are in, and seek safety in that religion which
promises that all thing* shall work together for
good to them that love God.
ATMOSPHERIC RAILWAY.
The idea of employing atmospheric pressure
in land carriages, first occurred to a Mr. Taylor
of Manchester, England, in 1805. But he only
contemplated the coveyance of letters and pack
ages through a tube of suitable diameter, exten
ding from one town to another. The tube be
ing exhausted by air engine at one end, the parcels
placed in the other end would be driven with im
mense velocity. Mr. George Medhurst, in 1810,
proposed a similar measure on a larger scale,
which however he says, “ met with that indiffer
ence which usually attends all attempts to devi
ate so widely from established customs.” The
principle however continued to be investigated
till, some two years since, an atmospheric rail
way was constructed in Ireland, by the Dublin
ana Kingstown company, k runs from Kings
town to Dalkey, distance one mile and three
fourths. The great difficulty to be overcome
was, that of rendering a tube sufficiently air
tight, and at the same time allowing a piston,
which should connect the motive power within
the tube with the bodies to be propelled on its
outside, to pass freely along an opening in this
tube. This difficulty was at length surmounted
by an invention of Mr. Clegg, which is fully
explained in an article on this subject in the Ec
lectic Magazine for July 1844. The tube or
pipe is laid in the middle of the track, and the
travelling piston, made air tight by leather pack
ing, is connected to the leading carriage by an
iron plate or coulter—which moves through an '
aperture formed in the top and along the whole
length of the pipe. The method of rendering
the pipe practically air tight, consists of a set of
vertical rollers attached to the piston rod at some
little distance behind the piston, progressively
lifting up, and another set of rollers attached to
the carriage closing down again, a portion of a
continuous flexible valve or flap of peculiar con
struction, covering the aperture.
The advantages of the atmospheric railway
over those now in use are represented as being
very great. In the first place the cost of con
struction and the annual cost of working, is re
duced more than one half. The speed also is
about three times as great as on the present rail
roads, it being from sixty to eighty miles an hour.
The atmospheric railway also admits of very
short curves, and can therefore be laid where it
would be impossible to run a locomotive. The
K'ngstown and Dalkey road above referred to,
passes over a section where a series of sharp and
difficult curves was unavoidable, and were no
locomotive engine could run but with the utmost
danger and at a slow pace, and yet this road is
now passed with the utmost ease and smothness
at sixty miles an hour. There is another point
of still greater importance, and that is the safety
of the passengers. This is increased, as the re
ports show, to as great a degree as is attainable
by any human contrivance. Collision is impos
sible, as the principle is such that two trains
cannot possibly run at once on the same section
of pipe. Neither can a train get ofT the rail, as
the leading carriage is firmly attached to the pis-,
ton which travels in the pipe between the rails;
and the danger from fire as well as the inconve
nience from cinders is avoided, as the engines
are stationary instead of travelling with the trains.
THE HEART OP WOMAN.
There is something very delightful in turning
from the unquietness and agitation, the fever, the
ambition, the harsh and worldly realities of man’s
character to the gentle and deep recessess of wo
man’s more secret heart. Within her musing
is a hunted and fairy thought, to which the things
of this turbid and troubled life have no entrance.
What to her are chances of states, the rivalries
and contentions which form the staple of our ex
istence'!' For her there is an intense and fond
philosophy, before whose eye substances flit and
fade like shadows, and shadows grow glowingly
into truth. Her soul’s creation is not as the mo
ving and mortal images seen in the common day:
they are things, steeped in dim moonlight, heard
when all else are still, and busy when earth’s
laborer’s are at rest. They are
“ Such itufT
As d reams are made of, and their little life
Is rounded asleep.”
Here is the real uncentred poetry of being
which prevades and surrounds her as with an air
which peoples her visions and animates her love,
which shrinks from earth into itself, and finds
marvel and meditation in all that it beholds with
in, and which spreads even over the heaven in
whose faith she so ardently believes, the mystery
and tenderness of romance.
A BANKER WITHOUT MONEY.
The Ckaravari tells a story about a million
aire of European renown, which is said to be.
‘ founded on fact.’ The anecdote is evidently
disguised by the artificial cookery of the Parisian
Punch; but it does not seem difficult to pick out
the real ‘fact.’ The day was very wet; and a
gentleman, wrapped in a pelisse, hastily got into
an omnibus, at the corner of Rue Lanttee. At
the Rue de Richelieu, opposite the Exchange
ne angntea, ana was going on, wnen me con
ductor stopped him with a demand for his six
sous. The gentleman felt his pocket, but h« had
no chauge. The conductor waxed angry. ‘ I
am M. de Rothschild,’ said the gentleman ;
1 there is my card.’ ‘ Never heard of you,’ said
the man; ‘ give me my six sous.’ The banker
was in haste ; 11 have only an order for a mil
lion,’ he said, ‘give me changf,’ handing a
couple of five per Cent Rentes for 50,000 francs.
The conductor started, and the passengers began
to laugh. Just then an agent 'de change came
by, and M. de Rothschild borrowed the six sous.
The conductor was seized with remorseful res
pect, and, turning to M. de Rothschild, he said,
“If you want ten fanes, sir, I don't mind
lending them to you !"
FOREIGN ITEMS,
Slaves of CHANCERY.-During the last term
the Lord Chancellor, on occasion of some pa
pers being laid before him, he took the opportuni
ty of animadverting upon the way in which office
copies of legal documents in Chancery v/ere
sometimes executed, in fact, as his Lordship ob
served, “disgracefully written.” The papers in
question were copies of depositions in the Exam
I iner’s office, for which 3d. per folio had been
I paid, of which sum the copyist received for his
labour 0}.; his Lordship expressed his surprise
at the smallness of the sum, and said “the matter
should be looked into.” This is one of the
best samples of the griping system pursued to
wards copyists of Chancery office documents ;
it is not howeverr'a thing of modern growth, it
has not resulted from the reduction of 13,000/.
a-year to the public by the abolition of certain
Chancery offices in 1842, as previous to that
time, nearly all the office copies of bills and an
swers in Chancery were prepared by individuals
in the neighbourhood of the Chancery offices,
who eked out a wretched existence by copying
the parchment documents usually at a trifle less
than a halfpenny a folio of ninety words. At
that time the charge to solicitors for office-copies
was IOd. per folio; it is now 4d. The work was
then given out in the evening, and executed du
ring Hie night. It is now done within the Office
of Records and Writs. As regards the Masters’
offices, the old plan still exists of employing per
sons as copyists who reside in the neighborhood,
independent of the few who have permanent sit
lings within the Master’s office. The charge
for copies of documents in the Masters’ office,
is 4d. per folio of ninety words: of this
sum the copyist receives one half penny
per folio, sometimes less: in fact, to such an
extent has this grasping,’griping system been
carried, that in one at least of these offices
the pay has been cut down to one farthing
per folio of ninety words. A steady writer will
get over ten folios in an hoar. What is the re
sult of his labour for a days’ work of ten hours,
at a farthing per folio 1—2s. Id. 1 A gTeat part
of the copies of documents in the Masters’ office
are, and ever were, prepared at night, and deliv
ered in by ten o’clock in the morning, by individ
uals who, to carry out their miserable existence,
lend and have lent, their aid in perpetuating a
system that has long required investigation and
amendment. Many an unfortunate being whose
fortune has not thrown better means in his way,
with a view of. putting a larger loaf before his
impoverished and half-famished family, by the
present copying {system, secures, as the reward
of his midnight toil, at one farthing per folio per
haps Is. 6d., and an early passage to the grave ;
whilst the sleek and well-paid Chancery office
clerk proceeds in his career of wealth, extracted
from the pockets of Chancery litigants, through
the toilsome pen of the miserable office-copy
slave.—London Weeleyan Chronicle.
Marriage Merchants of Paris.—There
are some very peculiar ocupations, at least
we should think them such in our country
of which, whether or not they are to be consider
ed as among the liberal professions it is hard to
say. For example, the marriage merchants
with their bureaus, transact a business of no lit
tle extent and importance, comprehending opera
tions of great tact and delicacy, very far superior
to the sordid affairs of ordinary commerce. How
far they speculate upon the affections it is diffi
cult to determine, but they seem to go upon the
scriptural rule, Where your treasure is there
will your heart be also; and therefore make the
treasure their sole point of calculation. It is
with them a sort of arithmetical problem, given,
a certain amount of treasure, to find, a corres
ponding amount of affection; a problem ordinari
ly as easy of solution in regard to earthly things,
as it is difficult in regard to spiritual. Take for
illustration one of their advertisements, which I
select word for word, from the newspaper.
‘Marriage.—Persons desiring to marry can
with perfect confidence address themselves to
Madame de Saint Marc; her relations with high
society put her iu in the way of giving informa
tion concerning widows and young ladies hav
ing dowries and fortunes up to two millions.
Ancient house St. Marc, under patent from the
government.’
As this is a genuine advertisement, if any per
sons to the eye of whom it comes, iq America or
elsewhere, desire to avail themselves of a golden
opportunity, doubtless the matter could be arran
ged by correspondence. Fortunes up two mil
lions I Think of that I What is not hidden be
hind it! Beauty, love, happiness, fine forms
dark eyes, glossy ringlets, fair complexions,
sweet tempers, intelligent minds, what is there
that is not wrapped up in two millions 1 My rea
ders may answer the question according to their
own habits of feeling and thinking, only it were
well to remember the proverb, Better is a dinner
of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and ha
tred therewith; and also that which goes before
it, Better is a little with the fear of the Lord, than
great treasure and trouble therewith. It is not
possible that affections can be bought and sold,
but if they could, the purchaseaud the sale would
spoil them.—Dr. Cheever.
Game Cases.—A lad named William Free
man, appeared to a summons, for having used a
ferret, for the purpose of killing rabbits, on land
in the occupation of Mr. William Kinder, of
Searches Farm. The lad admitted the offence,
but stated that he had been out of work for a long
time. Fined If. 3s. 6d., including costs. In de
fault to be impriso»ed for two months.—John
Perry, of Leverstock, was charged with having
shot a pheasant on land in the occupation of the
Earl of Verulam, on Friday morning, Nov. 22.
The case was proved, and defendent fined 31. and
costs, or three months’ hard labour; at the ex
piration of this term to find sureties for good be
haviour for twelve months.—George Kiff, a ser
vant in husbandry, in the employ of Mr. T. Oak
ley, Kingsbury Farm, wascnarged with having,
November 18, caught a rabbit in a trap, on land
belonging to the Earl of Verulam, in the occu
pation of Mr, Oakley. The case was proved,
and the defendant convicted in the penalty of If.
9s. 6d-, including costs, or one month imprison
ment with hard labour.—Joseph Ward was char
ged with being found in Tanner’s-wood, in the
occupation of J. Williams, Esq., in the parish of
St Peter. James Hfll, lookerout for Mr. Wil
jmmi,' siaieu, msi on r may alternoon ce law
the prisoner go into the wood ; got assistance,
surrounded it, made a search, and found the pri
soner lying on the ground under some nut-hazel
stems; took him to St. Alban’s and gave him
over Ip the police; searched the wood this morn
ing, and found a hare and a rabbit in snares, near
where the prisoner was found. The prisoner,
in defence, said:—“I was going through the
wood, and hearing such a noise with the keep
ers, I laid down till I saw who they was, as
keepers, have of late done so much injury.” The
prisoner was convicted in the penalty and costs
of 11. 5s. 6d. Allowed a fortnight to pay. Wil
liam Davis and James Davis, of Pegsdon, were
charged with using snares to destroy game on
Mr. RadclifTe’s manor. The case was fully es
tablished upon the evidence of John Bunyan, the
keeper. Fined, William 30s. and James 10s.,
or to be imprisoned; William for six weeks,
and James fourteen days. Committed according
ly.— Thomas Arnold and George Arnold, of
Pulloxhill, labourers, werecharged by Mr. Hill,
gamekeeper to Earl de.Grey, with having tres
passed in search of game on lands belonging to
his Lordship in the above parish, on the 10th in
stant. Neither of the parties appeared to answer
the charge. Convicted, and each fined 2L and
\l. 6d. costs, or to be committed to prison for two
months, in default of payment.—Hertford Mer
cury.
Copyright of Sermons.—A practice has
recently arisen oftakiugdown in short-hand the
sermons of first-race preachers, and of forthwith
printing and publishing them for the pecuniary
henefit of the person by whom the short-hand
writer is employed. We are asked whether the
preacher can check the practice by any proceed
ings in the courts of law or equity ? In other
words, whether such an act as we have mention
ed, amount to piracy? The two main princi
ples upon which copyright depends are these:—
first, that it is originally, a species of property ;
secondly, that it does not pass into other hands by
the act of publication. There can be no doubt
that a sermon, like a poem, a treatise, a history,
or any other manuscript, is the fruit of a man’s
own labour; that up to the time of delivery it is
his own property ; and that until that time it is
subject to his exclusive disposal. Thus there
can be no doubt that the first of the two princi
ples of copyright is applicable to a sermon. The
difficulty of the question, such as it is, will be
found toarise upon the second of these principles.
The delivery of a sermon from a pulpit amounts
to a publication. The hearer listens for his own
instruction, pleasure, and improvement. For
the same objects he may reduce the whole to
writing ; but it does not therefore follow that he
may print and publish it for his pecuniary bene
fit. Wee see nothing in the relation of the prea
cher in his congregation which can sanction such
a step. His duty is to teach and to instruct, to
point out religious duty, to persuade his congre
gation to be zealous in discharge of it ; but not to
make them a present of an essay which they may
publish with a profit.—Law Magazine.
The Changing “Times."—Notes ofinterro
gation and admiration are flying in clouds to the
Times, on. account of its rapid wheel about on
the subject of Romanism in the Church. This
change is not so incomprehensible to us as some
of the gyrations of the leading journal. The
case we take to.be this—Mr. John Walter the
younger, some time of Exeter College, and the
indoctrinated ot Sewell, was intimately associa
ted with some of the leaders of the Tractarian
party, who, through him, got access to the Times,
and freely used its columns ; Mr. Walter the el
der remaining passive, like an affectionate and
dutiful father. But amongst thegood qualities of
Mr. Walter must be reckoned a tolerant and
kindly spirit; he is a decided Churchman, but
no bigot. While thus passive, the Curate of
Hurst, Mr. Cameron, lateof Pembroke College,
reads some practical lessons on Puseyism to Mr.
Walter, who thereupon rubs his eyes, looks
about him, and acts with hischaracterestic decis
ion. He speaks with voice potential at Printing
House square^and the door is shut upon the Je
suitical Romanizers; who now address them
selves to him, “mostaffectionately and earnestly,"
beseeching him to consider their unhappy case,
but we imagine they may spare their breath.—
Oxford Chronicle.
Unfashionable Pulpits.—It was the re
mark of one Mr. Samivel Veller, (says the New
Haven Register) that it was-“a great pity to send
jackets to the heathen as they did n’t know the
comforts of’em," and from a circumstance which
has recently transpired, we are inclined to sub
scribe to Mr. Weller’s theory. It seeins that
when the Centre Church, in this city, underwent
a renovation, the old pulpit that had for years a
domed it, (and which to youthful eyes was the
embodiment ofall mechanical skill and ingenui
ty) was given by the Committee to the Sandwich
Island mission, as an article much to becoveted—
and was soon after “shipp'd in good order and
well conditioned,” with its mahogony front, tas
seled and velveted desk, to the Sandwich Islands,
region of Hawaii; there to be set up as an
—_f ___a _r .1_
of pulpit architecture. But it seems not to have
been received by the natives in a becoming man
ner—according to the latest news from that de
sirable region. Theiollowing notice of it in the
Polynesian, the Court Journal of Hawaii, proves
them to be a set of thankless heathen on whom
it is folly to throwaway such “comforts.”
“The benevolent propensities of our American
brethren not unfrequently display themselves in
a remarkable manner. We have often been
amused in witnessing the opening of some huge
package, prepared by kind souls afar off, for the
comfort of their friends this way. But we ven
ture to say, a greater or more striking display of
charity, was never exhibited in our streets, than
during the progress through them of the huge
pine-wood pulpit, recently landed from the Globe.
It has made its appearance here, covered with
carved work and cushions whose lustre has
somewhat faded through long years of preach
ing, flights of st3ps and sin. If an Esquimaux,
clothed in skins, and. redolent with trail oil, had
been suddenly dropped into our principal thor
oughfare, he would not have been more astonish
ed at the heat, than the recipients of this bounty
were at its magnitude. The cost of getting it
here cannot be much short of $200, and its use
may be represented thus, 0. From its appear
ance, we are not at all surprised that its original
proprietors were pleased to get it 20,000 miles
from home."
CHILDREN.
For the Southern Christian Advocate.
Frederick Cullen Estes was the grand
son of the Reverend William Arnold, of the Ga.
Conference of the M. E. Church. He died in
September last of congestivs fever, being about
eleven or twelve years old. He died a happy
death, as my young readers will see in the se
quel ; and, no doubt, every enlightened child
will desire to die as he did. But, my dear little
readers, if you would die happily, you must live
righteously. This little boy was taught to read
his Bible, to go to sharch, and to love God; and
he did not, like many children, slight these holy
instructions, but earnestly obeyed them. Borne
children are not willing to go to church unless
they pan be dressed as finely, and ride as ele
gantly as they wish, but Frederick would go to
church if he had to ride on a blanket instead of
a saddle. When he spent a Sabbath at home he
did not violate that holy day, as many boys do
by engaging in wicked sports, but took his bible
to the kitchen and read the blessed word of God
to old Ben, a pious coloured man. At one time
when his father was from home he held prayenr
with the family. His father being a very timid
man, sometimes neglected family prayer: this
pious child declared that he would hold prayers
himself if his father would not do it.
At the Putnam camp-meeting in August last
his good old grandfather, asked him if he was a
good boy—if lie said his prayers. He looked
serious, and answered that he did soy his prayers.
In the following September he was attacked
with tiie disease which ended his life. On the
second day of his illness he was much concern
ed about the salvation of his soul, and desired
that good old Ben should come in to pray with
him. Ben prayed with him; and when he ceas
ed, Frederick prayed himself. On the next
morning, the third day of his sickness, God blest
his soul abundantly—he praised God with a
loud voice—called in the family and prayed with
them—exhorted his father never to neglect
prayers again*—and then with his eyes upturn
ed to heaven, declared he saw Jesus and the
holy angels. Soon after this he fell asleep in
the arms of the blessed Redeemer, who has said,
“suffer little children to come unto me, and for
bid them not, for of such is the kingdom of hea
ven.”
My dear little readers, if you would die as he
died, you must live as he lived—you must read
your bible, go to. church, and pray to God
alw'ays. Wir. Houser.
* His father has, I am informed, been very strict in
the discharge of this duty ever since. Fathers, neglect
not family prayers lest your children reprove your sin.
Vesuvius, Burke Co., Ga.,Jan. 26<A, 1845.
SOMETHING FOR LITTLE CHILDREN
TO READ.
“ Ob, come sir, come and see my geraniuma
and my roses; they are here,” exclaimed a
bright little boy, skipping joyfully before his
father’s guest, leading the way to the green
house, full of budding and blooming plants. On
large rows of shelves were pots of various kinds
and sizes, filled with green things, fresh and
bright as the field flowers of June. The sun
looked gaily down upon this summer-like spot,
through the large glass windows, while all the
ground without and around wa3 covered with
the deep snows of winter. How carefully do
we watch, and how tenderly do we love the little
flowers which bloom in the cold winter for us.
“ I love flowers so much," cried the little
boy, as they passed along from one group to
another, pointing out their beauties, and telling
their names. 1 he gentleman loved flowers, but
he floved better to see the heart ol this little child
open to enjoy the beautiful things of God’s
creation.
“ Here is my cypress vine; and oh, here sir,
is my sensitive plant, it is such a beauty. Did
you ever see a sensitive plant before, sir?"
He looked up toward the gentleman’s face,—
that face was sad,—the smile had gone, and the
child wondered what made the gentleman look
so, with his eyes fixed upon the plant. “He
wants it, I really believe he does,” thought tho
little boy.
“ See how it shrinks away from my finger,
when I touch it,”^ he exclaimed aloud, “just as
if it felt.” With a few more touches, its leaves
quite folded up, and it looked naked and bare.
“ Is it not very queer ?” cried the child.
“Willie,” said the gentleman, sadly, “Ido
not love to look upon that.sensitive plant."
“ Why not?” asked Willie, earnestly.
“ It always makes me think of something,
which I shall never cease to be sorry for all the
days of my life," replied the gentleman, “and
it happened a great many years ago.”
“What is it!'1 asked Willie, with a deep in
terest; “ will you tell me?”
“ I had a mother once, and a very dear mother
she was, too; she loved me dearly, and watched
tenderly over me when I was sick*. When I
was a little older than you, my mother gave
me a sensitive plant,—we put it in the ground,
and took great pains to rear it; and every even
ing after we used to go and see how much it
had grown, and what new leaves it had put
forth. One day a cow by chance got into the
garden, and she very unceremoniously walked
here and there over the beans, and the carrot
bed, and the onions; yes, and over the flower
bed too, and she planted her great hoof right
over my sensitive plant. My mother discovered
the mischief first, and was just lifting it up and
shaking the earth from its leaves, when I came
by. 1 fancied she washandling it very rudely:
‘ Go away, mother, you are killing my plant,'
I angrily exclaimed, and fairly pushed heraway
with my hand. She looked at me with a grieved
and reproving glance, and then arose and walk
ed away. I staid lone alone in the garden, but,
Willie, I was no longer a happy boy. I had
been angry with my mother ! had almost stjhck
her I the dear mother who was so patient and
kind to me. And then, her grieved and mourn
ful look. How bitterly did I feel, 'Willie.”
Willie’s heart was touched by the sad tone of
the gentleman’s voice, and a tear stood in his
eye.
“ I won’t do SO,” Said Willie, with a niliverinir
voice.
“ V hope not, my child,—I hope not," contin
ued the gentleman; “If you do you are laying
up much sorrow in your heart for many years.
Not a great while after this, I went away from
home. I was away many long years, when I
did not see my mother’s face, but, \Villie, there
was one bitter memory which was always with
me, it made me feel like crying every time I
thought of it; and that was the wicked way I
had spoken to my mother. Whenever I was
awake at night and thought about my early '
home, I only longed to go there once more to
ask her forgivenes and blessing. In sickness,
among strangers, I remembered what a tender
nurse my mother had been, and I wept that I
had treated her unkindly. AVhen other boys
went home to their mothers, I wanted to tell them
how careful they must be not to occasion them a
sad and mournful thought. There are many
pleasant things I remer^ber when a boy; but
that one glance of my mother will draw tears
from me, even now I am a man. How often
djd I pray to God to spare me to come home, >
that I might hear my mother say that she forgave
and loved me still.' When I see a sensitive plant,
that sad and wicked scene comes all bark to nm
more strongly than ever; and now, Willie, if
you want to be a happy man, be careful that in
vour thoughts, your words, and your deeds, you
love, honor and obey your parents."
“ I will," said Willie, and he spoke from tha
very bottom of his heart. And ever afterwards
did this sensitive plant tell his young spirit a sad
and serious story; and whenever angry and
wicked passions awoke in his little bosom, a
look at his sensitive plant bade him honor h»
parents always '• ■ ...
