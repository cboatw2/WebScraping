vention to nullify the TaritTof 1842. 1. Because I
I do not believe such a measure i? desired by the
people of this District, or of the State, at" the present
time. 2. Because such a measure most necessarily
tend to divide aud weaken *iic South, at
a time when union and concert of action are rcquired
to secure our common rights and to protect
L our common interests. 3. Because in the probaY
bility of the triumph of the Democratic party,
there is, in mv judgment, good reason to hope for
such a modification of our revenue laws, as will 1
relievo us of tin ir oppressive operation.
Secondly.?J am in favor of jiving the election
of Electors of PresidcjU and Vice President tr^tiie 1
people of the State. 1. Because I think a fair
construction of the 2d Clause of the II. Article of '
the Constitution of the United States, hardly jus. 1
tifies the Legislature in assuming the election of
Electors: and 2. Because all the other Stale# have '
given this election directly to the people; and I j i
do not know any reason to suppose, that the good I
people of South Carolina are not as capable as i
anv other, of exercising this privilege. 1
Thirdly,? I am in favor of giving the election !
of Covernor directly to the people. 1. Because
this, also, is more consonant to Democratic usage '
than the present-mode; and, 2. Because it would 1
prevent and entirely destroy the vile system of I
caucus influence, whi'di has so long prevail in our 1
State, in the election of Governor.
Fourthly.? I will vote (if elected; for J K.
Polk ; because I believe that in the present Presi. ,
* dcnlial content, we have exnt tly the same issues
presented to the poopte, as have existed in all the I (
previous struggle? between the Republican and !
k Federal parties ; and because I hel eve that if .T. | |
K. Polk is elected, the Government .vi;l be ad. ' ,
ministered on such principles, as to restore pcaee j
and pros-, .-rit. he v. ok- country.
Thus I h=?v? briefly responded to " Many Voters,'"
though I hav< some doubts of tiic propriety |
of answering anonymous communications in the
public papers, espc-naliy since there is no paper of | ;
such large circulation in I) ;r!ington, as to make
it a general medium of information to the people. I
I have already, (and int< n I during the remainder
of the canvass to continue to do so,) expressed |
mvseif freely and fu'Iv on the leading subjects j 1
now agitating the public mind. In the present J
exposition of iny sentiments, a!! that can he expectcd,
is the synopsis I have given above.

Tiie Cotton Crop.
From observation and information otherwise
received, we are irroistahly lead lol/ic conclusion,
tlia* the crop of Cotton, this year, will he unusu.
ally large, probably greater than ever before. It
is true, in certain sections, of limited extent, how-, j
ever, adverse causes have tended to shorten the j
crop, hut the general product of the United States (
and Texas, added to the stock on hand in this j
eountry and in Europe, will swell I lie total to an
extent, we fear, far beyond the quantity required !
for consumption. Should this be the case, prices :
must fall still lower than they now arc, and the j
further pursuit of this brunch of industry become j
ruinous to all engaged in it. With these fears
and anticipations, which we feel it to he our duly
to express, we leave it to the discretion of our
Planters, rith r to accept the reduced rates nffcr;i?",
or run the hazzard of future developments.

COTTON.?Tue receipts during the past)
week, have probably amounted lo 200 bales. The
market was dull throughout, holders b.ing reluc.
; i.:t to s-!l at prices offering. We quote extremes
at 5$ to ? princjp il sales 5$ a 5|. Ou Sunday
evening, advices from England ware received to
the lib September, shewing a decline in the Rriti.-ii
market of from ?d to ^d, with dull sales. This
news has had a prcccptihle cff. ct on our market.
S des. yesterday, were made at 5| cents, for the
very best .quality, and the market is extremely
heavy.
E VCOX.?Sales during tnc past week,amounted
to ah.nit 8,000 pounds at 8 cents.
I'LOUu.? Is in demand, at S i,00 from Wagons.
A superior article would command sometiling
high. r. the quality of the article recently
received being somewhat inferior.
THE iilVEit?lias fallen, and is now too
low for cither Steam or Pole Roots, unless of very
light draught of wafer. The Oscwl'i is discharging
her cargo at Spark's landing, alvout 20 inilcs
Ik-low this, and forwarding it in wagons. The
present appearances are favira'ulc for r.;in.
Chari.kston, Sept. 21, 1844.
Cotton.?The Upland Cotton market may he
eon-idered flat. The transactions of the week
being light, amounting only to 950 bales, as follows:
6 at 4$ ; 7 at 4? ; 18 at 4|; 17 at 5 ; 14
at 5$ ; 73 at 5$ ; 34 at 5$ ; 69 at ;.|; 37 at 5| ;
47 at 6 ; 50 *t 6$ ; 203 at (i$ ; 259 at ti?; 48 at
C| ; 7 at 6|. This quiet state of the market for
the past week, may he attributed in some degree,
to so few buyers coming forward to operate, they
holding luck for the daily expectations of the Hrit
:n!i steamer's accounts, which, if favorable, will no
doubt give a now impetus to the market. No
h inge in prices having taken place, we therefore
continue o;;r quotation? of ia*t weed. Receipts
of the week 1777.?Courier.
Nkw Yons, Sept. 19.
Cotton.?The decline in the Liverpool and
Havre markets, recti ved by the steamer to the 4'.h
inst. was n<>t altogether unexpected. Stiii there
