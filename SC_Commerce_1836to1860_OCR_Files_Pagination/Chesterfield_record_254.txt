jlir Editor,?Behoving thatihe following
remarks on the laws which govern ihe pro..' ^
ductiou and propagation of malaria.may in a j ,
measure be useful and tnteres'ing to many of ^
your readers, from the fact of the prevalence ^
and fatality ot * hat is termed Country Fev?
t'C amongst our mhabiftnte, and especially : !"
the agricultural portion, I have been induced ia
to submit them to _\ou for your journal, if
you think ilimn worthy of a place in its i w
pages. 1 have condensed the subject very 1 j
much, from the circumstances of the limit ol j
a journal like this, and have only detailed ^
some verv striking facts which cannot fail ;.'
to be interesting. i rc
The first law we shall notice in regard j
to t e propag.rion ofmalai ia, is, that it obeys v( ^
the motion of the atmosphere, being con- 1 ^
veyed by winds to some distance from the i
locality where it is generated, with equal if j ^
not greater fatuity. It has often been at- ; jc
tempted to ascertain the precise or probable !
distance that malaria can bo conveyed by j ^
winds, to produce fever, but all such at- ! rc
tempts have fhil? d :o establish any exact or
certain distance. Notwithstanding this, ; .j;
cases are related where it has been Iran- 1 Cu
smitted to the distance of even three miles, j
Tho convent Jof Camaldoh, in Italy, is an j ,jt
iilustraiion of this fact. I: is situated on a ex
very high hill, three miles from the Lake ! ,t'j
Agnano, which is the nearest source of mal- ! aQ
aria, producing remittent and intermittent fe- i [J'
versamongst the inmates. We are inform. ; ^
ed by a writer on the climate of I'aly, that, ca|
mif nf sfvpntv.six unhcakhv towns and viL .1
~' " * J "V _ [|J?
lages, thirty five are situated on hills some aal
distance from locality, I.k'ly to produce ? (
malaria. The marshes about Ereth in wj.
K' nt. sa s M'Collock, are less injurious t? j
the inhabitants of the lower grounds near
them, than might be expected, while their
effect on the houses which are situated high ; ^
on the hills above, is such, as at diff rent j |f)|
times to iiave bc? n s -verely ft It by the in- j
habitants. This circumstance he attributes I nn
to a current of air so directed, as to escape
the low grounds, while it ascends and (>[)
affects the emin nces. |
The distance at w hich malarin may pro- ne
duce its effect, consti ules u subject worthy sa]
of inquiry ; for ind v duals living in die coun f)|
try of.en think the location ol their residences ni,
safe, because they have no s'andmg water I on
1 :
near them, when there is a swamp or a low . m,
piece of ground some distance olH When j J,!
tever prevails, they seldom or never think i th?
or believe, that the exciting cause may be ry
only a mile or two miles off; but they jm. h0
agint* the sickness to be of a peculiar nature, ?}K
not in any way attributable to "he immediate j ea
locality. These hints may prove useful to j ne
many of my readers n tf?e choice of their !0I
summer residences, wtuch oug .t o be a lew co
mi es from any locality to generate mala j ,,r
ria. | thi
Writers on the diseases of warm clima cs,' tri
hav sta i U many I e ls in rej.ition to this ! cc
(-at: ot our suhj ct, which are highly inter, j kn
Csting and important. Some of these au ! tio
thors do not think, that this poison c m pro- ! cl*
(luce disease at the distance ofmore than a di
quarter of a mile. Dr. Lin I, in hisob?er. j ch
vntions on the preservation of the h alih of j va
seatnen, says, u That wiien Commodore j as
Long's squad r. in, m the months ot July aod s?
August, in 1744, lay off the mouth of the be
Tiber, it was observed that one or two of or
the ships which lay closet to the shore, be. th
gan to be atfected bv the pernicious vapor re
from the land ; whilst sow lying further out ! lint
sea, at but a very small distance from the sa
former, had not a man sick. At the same Sj
time, the Austrian army, under the com- sc
mand of Prince Lobcowitz, suffered so great he
sickness through tho proximity of their sit- i vy
nation to the marshy coun'rv, that they were j w
obliged to decamp." There is no doubt i ec
that the distance to which malaria may be ; ci
conveyed, depends much upon the wind, j Jo
whici) when strong, may waft this poison j
many miles. Dr. Bancroft, in his work on , fr
Yellow Fever, expresses himself strongly d<
on this subject. " The distance, sa\s he, to
to which theexhalation of marshy grounds in
may be conveyed from their source, and re- j w
tain the poison of causing the yellow or oth- hi
or marsh fever will partly depetftl on the di
force of the wind, and par ly on the extent 1 a]
of the suWtfcc from which they arise?and j ti
on their being more or less copiously extr.- : b<
catcd from that surface. If the wind be very j it;
moderate, and blow steadily from ihe same s o!
point, and if the miasmata be abundantly j ti
emitted from a very great extent of surface, 1 pi
it seems probabio that so large a mass of sj
then: nt? w~?!d time he formed. tr;gh: h? con- p
yed a quar;er an J perhaps a Iiaifj
iilc, before it became so diluted with at- | '
tospheric air, or so dissipated by the wind, i j
s to lose i;s morbdir power." This is only ' ?
apposition on tho part of this author ; but1 i
ie ease cited be/ore ol the conven oi Cam.' 5
Idoli, proves that it has been Lnown'to pro- | i
uce its deadly elfect at li?e distance ofj ?
tree miVs. A very strik ni* instance ofj 1

k? wind shifted suddenly to the southward, i

Another important law in relation to ma- ]
ma is, that it is dispersed by the rays of! i
:e sun, for which reason the ni_?hts and the a
arlv morning are the most dangerous j c
ni' S to be exposed to miasm itic districts. ! t
'he fog or vapor, when acted upon by the : >
cat of ihe sum, is ratified, and becoming : i
ghter than the surrounding atmosphere, | d
scends 'o some cons.durable height. By i
lis process. tl:o sickness oil high mountains 1 ,,
as been accounted for. Individuals ex- j,
osed at night :o nial ?ria, have instated tins , j.
iw of nature, by building up large tires, the
at of which has the same chemical efFeC | j.
s tint of the sun. The use of fires indis- j v
puting malaria, and rendering it innoxious \ s
is been long known and acted upon. We i ^

Malaria is also in?crc?,pted by trees, with ^
ick foliage a tribu e.l to mere mcchani- 'lc
1 V
I obstrucuon, the vapor settling m the fol- ;
je. The la e Dr. Faust, of Columbia, in CJ

lion of m-ilari't, is to be attributable much, i ^
lot more, ?o the mechanical obstruction
lich they aflforJ, as lite chymical change /
uch takes place during the process of
fetation, for high fences or walks have ! ^
orded the same protection. In Rome, j |
ring the sickly season, the mo:?t prudent .
labitants, conscious of this fact, retire into j ' j
ir houses at sunset, close the windows | ^
I Ql
d doors, and w:ll not allow them to be I
ened until the sun has been up long ] P
ough to dissipate the fog. In this way they I
ve kept from contracting ft vcr, when their i ^
ar neighbors, not nnking use of the same
lutary precaution, have sickened and died, i
\ James Johnson, who has bestowed j tc
jch attention on th.s subject, in his work ;
Tropical Climates, remarks : ' During '
y residence tear the marshes of Lnngue. |
c,I lived near a very fine building formerly :
i convent Franquevaux.errcted on the ve.
Korder offhn rri:ir?hf>?. The monks in the |
use were perfec:ly healthy, though lew of ' P1
i inhabnonts ofilie environs escaped dis- i ,lj
so in summer or au'umn. Tradition I
vrrtiu h ss relates, that they were nccus- |
ned in hot weather, to sleep on a tcrrnce j *
ntiguous :o the coveivnt, a sure method 'n
exposing themselves to disord -rs ; but 10
y were >hel rr"d l.y a ten* of double or
pie canvass. and this simple pr?*cau ion ne. M
s try ag oris the musqunoes, proved, uniov\n
to tuem, a sti.l mor" certain protec- ai
>ii against miasmata." Now t'?'s goes ;
arly to prove, that ill" s lt' ty of these in . et
vi funis was entirely attributable to the me. j n
anic.i! obstruction afforded by the can** j A
ss. It is of en noticed by persons ivi h j "i
totnshmenf, tiia' one bide of a s reet is the ol
at of sickness, and not the other : this can ?f
' accounted tor on tiie same principle,
in row of houses b ing more exposed than n'
e other. Tins has even been noticed as hi
gards large bu Mings, on" part being pf r~ n
itiy liealitiy, an 1 the other not so. It is < w
id, ihat in the extensive hospital cf ??t. ! ^
jirno, in home, tt.e wards to itic south and s|
uth-east are sickly, and the others quite ?
ialthy. VVe might mention many similar j J
taniples, which although highly iiiter. shng, I *
e are compelled to omit, as we must pro .! d
red to examine some of the most evident j n
mc?<c of the increased unheal.hiness nfil.o !
w country of this State. j i>
The change in the cultivation of lice j I
om inland to river.swamps, 1 have no | n
lule, is a very fruitful cause, The dele. J (rious
efleet of tins change, was to leave an j f
imense extent of rice.fields abounding ' t!
itli stubble, Iron) which is stfil by the in. j r
ibitar.ts.of India, the poison is chiefly pro- |
need ; and not being cultivated, there is j t<
ways a sufficient quantity of water to do ail j
ic mischief. Extensive rice fields have i I
L'en allowed to lay w .ste, by falling into the j 1;
ands of individuals, who bad not the means J t
fcultivaling them. It .stbroug'u this agency J c
lat we account for the sickness which now ; c
re vails in si undoes where the inhabitants ' |
lent their summers formerly, when - very I li
'wye?*: under h'jjh "t!'i'T ;. rt. \
Clearing land is another fruit.ul cause. !
l'lio surface of the earth with the vegetable l
natter, becomes exposed to the action of the !
;iin. and malaria is readily furiEeJ; but!
vlien the surface of the ianci is thorougljiy j
iliaded. tho agency of the rays ofiho sun is ,
n a great measure cut otf. This circum-!
>tanee is proved by the fact, that summer
esidences in pine-land, in most cases, re- j
miii beal'liy, until the ofiieious hand ofman i
ies.'roys the trees, and allows tit.* heat of die I
juii to act on the land. It is said that it; j
vas for this reason that the Runans conse- j,
. rated their groves and woods. Conii?c-- |
i with this, is the turning of new laud for j.
:L'Iiivatiori in summer, which I think has I
icon almost overlooked. The village of i
['iueviilc, wliich a Horded so pleasant and !
. onvenient a residence for many families,' ^
incl now almost entirely deserted, may be j j
:it<d as an example of the injurious prae- j,
ice of clearing and cultivating land in the ,
ucinity of a summer residence. The follow. I (
eg instance is one of much importance, and ; <
leserves our attention. j
During the summer of 183-1, when $e ;.]
pace in f ront of the Citadel in this city, wfcs j t
11 a sta'c of preparation by ploughing the! (
,ind, in order ?o level it for a Parade Ground, J i
el.'ow fever, of a verv malign ml nature, at-1 ?
** ^ j
icked the soldiers, which I have no doubt!;
/as caus'-d, if not aggravated, by the expo, j |
ure of the land?there were very few cases i ]
l the city. M
* i1
flow often do we hear of digging ditches I
C?
nd drains in the summer, causing sickness; ji
/hich fact should shew us the propriety of j 1
loing such work in the winter. The rich (
inds oftiie West, when first cleared and i
urned for cultivation, if done in summer, r
/ill cause the deaths of many, which I think t
as already been the case. Volney Rush, <
rCulloek, and many other eminent writers, I
ave noticed die fact, that the breaking up i
ur the first lime of meadow land, for culti- <
ation, is always attended with fatal confce- <
uences. A writer on die diseases of India, i
escribes the diseuse produced by this proess
of cuHvation, to be as fatal as the (
lague. Laborers residing but one night on I
ic spot newly turned in summer, invariably; t
ie. I [
These causes, I think, serve in a great! t
icasure to account for the greater produc. r
on and propagation of malum in our own i
niintrv now. than many vears ago ; for lo- [
alii ies once the seat of sickness *.nd death,! t
ave been rendereJ perfectly healthy, by re-; I
loving the causes of the production of mama.
of which we have spoken. Many situ- I
tions in Italy and India, may be cited as {
xemplifying this fact, but let us take an c;: r
mple nearer home. During my residence \ I
i Philadelphia, a few years ago, different j a
arts of the suburbs of the ci y were pom ' h
:d out to me, as being but a few years pre. |
ious, as unhealthy as any part of our 1 >w c
auntrv, which now -s as healthy as any part) I
f that beautiful city. This beneficial chunjf* n
is been effected by draining, filling u?, i;
ad building, to the entire ext !?** ? ' ol bl- r
us fever. Dr. Caldwell, in his treatiseon
lalaria, remaidcs, - tfnt the large body of u
nd adjoining Philadelphia, on the scuth, j.
illed the Neck, half a century ago, was t
Jt little better than a great morass. Nor f
d ihe Pontine marshes surpass it much in <j
e extent and violence of its aurumnil dis- f
lsos. But time and labor have convi-rted it m
i-o meadows, fields and gardens, richmtlke .
oducts of several kinds of cultivation. Ifor "
Des it flourish more in vegetation than in
:a!th. It population is now dense. Sich
the happy rasult of draining, banking aid
anting." I am filly persuaded that our ovn j
ty may be extended, by pursuing ihe sane r
ocess on the neck, which in many places ^
so liable to fever, owing almost entu?ly j
> their heing so perfectly neglected, c^ie illv

>y animated conversation, the fice is full j
)fexpression and sweetness, and strongly j
ndicative of character. Her man.j
lers are bland and unaffected : Indeed,
here is a simplicity and frankness and en-j
paging affability about her quite remarka- 1
l)le for a Queen. Another striking thing
is the total absence of all ambitious display

" In relation to the Queen's personal

lorsebuck, and that at a rapid pace, going j
it the rate of 10 or 12 miles an hour. Of

a larm for 812,000 for the silk culture,
and are entering extensive y on the business.
Silk.?We saw, a few clays since, a quanti
fy of most beautiful cocoons, made by worms
fed this spring by Capt. Charles Vanderford
of our town. They are of snow wlnteness,
brilliant lustre and very large. Three of
those made by worms vi the lirst clay's hatch- [
ing weighed DO grains, being an average of 30
grains eac% iloss o!T. But those from the second
and third day's hatching (no? gathered
when we saw them) are considerably largerThe
worms began to spin on the 30th April,
27 days after they were hatched.
Now from the 1st of May, when the feeding
of a second set of worms might commence, to
the 9th. October, beyond whick time the morons
multicaulis affords tender and succnleut ,
leares, there are 102, or six times 27 days. If, ,
therefore, eggs kept on ice can be made to <
hatch at any time during summer and autumn, |
as experience seems to prove, six additional
crops of silk might be made by Capt. Vanderford,
or seven in all, if he had the eggs and the (
ice house, by the 9th of October; provided the '
worms should always commence spinning in
27 days after hatching ; and it has been found -t
that they commence in a shorter thne during j
the heat of summer, than in the cool weather of
spring. What Capt. Vanderford could do, any
one else could do with the same car ?. As it ;
requires more hands to attend the worms for
the first two o: .hree weeks, than for the remainder
of feeding time, some of the hands {
might then be employed, after the first crop of r
the season, in gathering and reeling the co- ?
coons. It requires, at most, not over three t
hands to attend worms enough to make a t
crop of 100 lb. of reeled silk. If then these I
three hands could make seven, or even six crops p
in a*season, it would be 200 lb. to the hand I
which at ?5 per hand would be 81000. (
We would advise no one to give up or neg- s
lect o'her business for the purpose of commencing
the s lk culture, with an expectation of
realizing 81000. or even ?500 to the hand, annually.
If the data before us would seem to
warrant such an expectation, still the thing has
never been done ; and it is possible it never
may. Our wish is only to induce men to ex-1
periment for themselves, and that with proper j
caution. Many will do it, and the result will
teach others as well as themselves what can
be done. But do not the facts before the public
render it probable that those who enter
earliest upon the experiment will be naost rich-lyas
well as soonest rewarded] For if the
profits may be inade as great as is supposed or
any thing like it the rush into the business
must, after a time, reduce them.
The expense of making an experiment need
not be great. The business ought to be conducted
on a small scale at first, by persons
unacquainted with it. Otherwise disappointment
an<l failure would most probably be the
result of the errors into which they would be
likely to rall.
Morus Multicaulis buds for an acre, (say
1500) even at the last spring's prices, would
cost only ?45. The nexf spring, they may
not cost the th;rd of it Let every person not
satisfied with the income from his present r
agricultural products, plant a few acres, or c
one acre, or thp half, or fourth, or tenth of an a
acre, in morus multicaulis, and procure a few
silk worm eggs of the white mammoth variety, j(

and then on a larger, as he gains experience. v
The expense in this way will be small, and ^
the profit may eventually be great. The c
present is not the season of the year for p ant- r
ing the multicauhs ; but it is a suitable sea- 8
son to look out for the eggs. The worms, the c
first year, may be fed on the leaves of the native
mulberry, if no better can be had.
Shocking Murder.?We learn that a Mr.
Thomas Bradley, of Anson county, N. C. was s
murdered whilst peaceably at work in a 1
corn field, on the 6th instant. We for- J
bear to state the circumstances, as they ,
were related to us, from the danger of im- \
properly influencing the judicial investigation <
which we suppose will, of course take p.'ace. '
We have not learnt whether or not the aheg- t
ed murderer has been apprehended. The in- j
creased frequency of the crime of murder in i
this part of the country is hardly to be won- J
dercd at, when the lacinty wen wnirn mur- j
derers are allowed to escape proper punish- J
raent, is considered. I ?

The cultivators of the soil constitute tour- t
fifths, if not nine-tenths of the population
f this country. If we except ministers of '
the gospel, they are the most useful and vir- ^
tuous, and ought to be the most respected of t
our people, in at least the same proportion as
they are most numerous; and yet how few of
our thousand newspapers and other periodicals,
are devoted to the interests of agriculture,
or pay any regard to them. <
