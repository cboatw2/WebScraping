3d, That as these measures arc adopted
entirely with a view to the protection
of our own Banks, against the effects of

the following: ?

" r air auuiui I9CU in nil y lil'tt III Villi- l
sequence of the suspension of specie payments
by the New York ciiy Hanks, the
'Newark Banking and Insurance Company,
and the Mechanics Hank at Newark
have also resolved to suspend specie payments
for the present. Ii can hardly he
necessary for us to add that no Banks in
the U. S. have been more prudently rna-j
naged, and we believe that none are in al! .
respects in as sound a condition. Their hill- |
arc of course as laliiuhlo as ever, a*ul will
continue to he current in all ilie transaelious
of business. Specie payments will
he resumed whenever the city bunks Commence
again.
We learn also that the New-Brunswick,
Kahway, Elizuhethlown, and Patersou
fianks have adopted the same expedient.
Providence Banks.? We learn from
a passenger in the Providence boat, that
the Bunks in that city suspended specie
payments on Thursday morning, as soon
as (he news from this city reached.
JCews ! News !?We are asked an in- <
numerable number of times iti 'be course
of a day?* What is the news?" Iii answer
we t'ive the following, received at
tlic Ihtston Transcript Ollice, by Express."
The mammoth steamboat heviallian,
eleven hundred and seventy six tons burthen
has arrived to New York from Liverpool,
in the unprecedented passage of ,
seven days and twenty three hours from
lattd to land. lief speed was so great
when she got fairly undt r way, that Capt. (
Whale was compelled to bring the pilot
with him, not being able to stop the boat
in time to put him on board the pilot cutter,
until the steamer bad crossed the Atlantic..
The boat made excellent weather. 1
and has consumed only nine chaldr ?ns of
coals. She brought two hundred and ten
cabin passengers, and live hundred and
lifiy-lhree in thfc steerage. Amongst the ]
former we notice the names of Bulwer the
novelest ; the celebrated Pagatiini ; James '
Crow Rice, Esq. ; Lord John Russeli; Mr. 1
O'Connell, son of the Agitator; Miss CobI.
I i. a %ir<il> g~y t

; Miss Lamlop ; (L. Ik L.;) Mr. >
Cruikslmnks, the caricaturist ; ll:e famous
hoi?k publisher. Mr. Murray; Mr. Locklmrt;
Thomas Moore, the bard of Ireland,
and a dozen other equally celebrated personages
whose names we have not lime (
to mention now. The arrival of the Le- i
viathan has created a tremendous scusa-*
lion at New Yo<k, and occasions even
: more conversation than the great failures
! which continue to be announced almost 1
hourly, and threaten total paralysis to the
commerce of the city. The Leviathan
brines a report, received at Liverpool by
Express, at the moment she was departing,
that the Hank of England luid failed, j
We think it highly probable that the arrival
of so many of the nobility and other
distinguished personages in this country,
has some connection with this lamentable
event, which must revolutionize the Government
of Great Britain.

From Mr (J Senior, a Machinist of New Orleans.
l)r A Jo es-?Dear Sn , in answer tc j'our inquiry
of my opinion of your Fa tent Cotton Gin, I
beg leave to state, that I was fifteen years engaged
in the cotton factories of Manchester, Englanil,
and during four years of that time, I war
foreman in the house of Messrs. Lewis, Williams
iV Co.. d near live years spinner in the house of
Messrs. SSandford &. Gncne. i have seen your
Cotton Gin in operation, and have examined tho
notion ginned by i', and pronounce it better ? leaned,
and the staple less injured, than any cotton
that ever came under my observation. It is completely
ready lor the breaker without the aid of the
Lilowr-r, and would, therefore, save the first process
in manufacturing the article. 1 consider cotton
cleansed by your Gin, would command from out*
lo two cents on the pound more than the average
rrops brought into the Manchester market, nnd
cleansed by common Ciu? Ynurr, very icsp'ly.
N. Orleans, March 5', GEORGE SENIOR.

much impioved, over that produce d 5\v the eoiirmon
Gins. Yours ?5kc. S. BENNETT.
