MARLBOROUGH ACADEMY?We
understand that the public examination in the
Female department of this fl >unsliing institution
will commence on Thursday the 11th ins*,
at 11 o'clock; and in the Male department on
Friday the 12th. We are authorized to in.
vitc the friends of the pupils and the public to
attend; and we- would urge it upn t parent,
and upon all "who take an interest in the
education of the rising generation to do so.?
The conviction, founded upon long experience,
that public examinations ate a necessary part
of the exercises of good scliools, is so univer- t
sal, that they are never dispensed with, so far
as we know of, in any College or Academy in
the country. - But the benefit to be derived
from these examinations is, in a great measure,
lost, when the public fail to attend.
CONGRESS.?The Bankrupt bill is
still before the Senate, or was at the date

COCOONS
We have left, for inspection, at this office,
on-? dozen selected Cocoons, troin a stock of
worms reared here this season?the whole
weighing 21 dwts. 18grs ; one of which weighs
53 grs. The wor ?.s which produced these
Cocoons were remarkably healthy; were pur.
.clrased for, and believed to be, ' the two crop
while." ' . ;
A few thousand of the eggs can be had oy
application at this office.
Camden Journal.
The two crop worm is generally small, and
makes a^mall cocoon, noi more than half the
size of the above. We therefore suppose these
not to be a two crop worin, though some of the
eggs 1rom the first crop may hatch.

It has been a settled purpose with me ever

far as possible, the mingling of the question
ofabolition wMi the party politics of the

to the South, to permit it to bo involved in
.theephemeral tho' violent passions of po. j

of empty noise, flung backwards and 1
forwards?with less and less import from
day to day. In such a state of things, I saw j

into immnent danger, wh-n we permit our.
svfves to suppose that a portion of the South, j
who diff r with us on the Pr?'si lential elec- :

slavehoiaiog State of Virginia It is, in
tIk* most emphatic way, declared that she

follows in the St. AtJgtis'fne Herald. It-is
the keenest kind of military tactics on re- ' '
cord. u Cap!..iin Raines, commanding that I

in such a manner that any attempt to re- j
move the garment would explode the shell:
This he placed at a distance trom the post. f
In a litilc* while the shell was heard to explode?,
and CJapt. R: lines repaired to the spot, j a
when h.e discovered Indian signs, a pony : |,
track,--and some hlood. So pleased was he J ?(
at the succe8i of the experiment, that he j
placed another shell similarly prepared, co- j
V'Tcd wi'li a bhJnke', and haired. It cx* j 1
ploded, and on going to the spot it was dis- , |i
c.tveredjha: the Indians had tie I an opos- i ?
sum to it,and its exertions ro escape, had ex- i ^
ploded the shell. .The In linns had station- \
ed themselves, and as they came up fired, j
upon the troops, killing one sergeant and one
private, wounding C'pt. Rungs mortally*
and three privates. The In hans are variously
