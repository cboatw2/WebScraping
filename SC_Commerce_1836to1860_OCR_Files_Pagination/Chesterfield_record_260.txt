14. Cheshire is devoted almost exclusively
to the dairy husbandry ; and has
been celebrated for the excellence and abun
dance of its produce. For the goodness of
their cheese, however, I must rely upon au
ttiority. lis appearance in some ot the
dairies, which I examined, bespoke careful,
ueatand skilful management,
A. faiwriu 25 cows, states their average
yield at 500 lbs. cheese, and 20 lbs. but er
to a cow. He says likewise that 1500 lbs.
pork are to be credited to his cows.
The average cost or value of his cows
is $30 each; wintering $14 : pasturing 26
weeks, $6 25; he raises some calves upon
whey. It requires the whey of two or three
cows to raise a calf. H s hogs at 18 mos.
average 350 lbs.; they run in a pasture
and have the refuse of the daiiy until abou
six weeks before it is intended to kill them,
when they are shut up and fed with coru
and meal. A shrewed farmer observes,
that where swine in this way run in a pasture,
it should be laid down as a rule, to have 1
their trough always wet or always dry.? 1
This means that they should have as m ici? '
whey as they ore d sposed to ea'; or, by J
being kept wholly without any, taey should
from necessity get their living in the pasture. ;
They require quietness of mind and free. 1
dom from restless desires in or i? r to thrift j I
I .1 I'l .i '
anu iney are nice ower epicureans whom
variety and abundance render fastidious. 1
The dairy of another.farmer consists of '
20 cows. Tne year before last they yielded t
400 lbs. new milk cheese ; the last year 400 r
lbs. each, besides an ample supply of but- 5
ter for the family. He calculates upon tl e 1
proportion of one hog to four cows ; with 1
the above cows he made 1200 lbs. of pork, 1
600 lbs. of which he credits to the cows ; ^
he deems three acres necessary for the pas- v
turage of a cow. His cows during the 8
spring, have an allowance of rye meal and t
whey. t
In another case the produce of 23 cows
was 12,000 lbs. new milk cheese, and 500 (
lbs. butter. s
Another case from 11 cows including 4 J
three year-ol i heifers, there were so'd and a
used 3475 lbs. new milk cheese, and 403 I
lbs. butter. Three hogs were likewise fat- s
ted; and it was considered that 400 lbs. s
pork were to be credited to the cows Two 1
tons ofhav were required for the wintering u
4 w
of a cow, valued at 88 per ton ; or sue
might be kept for hire at 50 ets. per week, b
In another case 30 cows madj 14,000 i<
lbs. new milk cheese ; and 600 lbs. butter,
in this case some calves were raised ; but tl
most of them were killed at four days old. ti
Throughout the county of Berkshire this ai
mode of dealing with the calves is termed w
deaconing" them. What is the particular oi
propriety of this provincialism, I am unable ti
to determine; and whether it had its origin
in any superstition among the aborigines or p;
the first sett'ers of the county, I sh il! leave n:
to the antiquarians to ascertain. If is a &
p^calwritr, and prevaJ<? vo tvhore e!*e. . ol
Til? practice with this farmer, is to give <
bod? d corn in the car to his cows ; perhaps ,
n dozen ears to a cow per day. When it 1
is conveniently had, he gives a mess of rye i
meal to each cow, at the rate cf two quar s <
per day* for three weeks in the spring. He ,
is anxious to let his cows go to the grass as
soon as the ground is bare. He thinks

In 40 days of the best of the season on
this farm 30 cows produced 4000 lbs. butter.
The land required for the pasturage of a
cow is considered to be three a?T ts.
From thirty cows, an average of 425 lbs.
of cheese has been produced to each cow,

On one farm, where IS cows wrekept,
11.3S5 lbs. new milk c ieese were m ule in
a season, which <jives tne cxtr o dinary
average of 632 1-2 lbs. to a cow. 200 lbs.
of batter were ma le the same season from
the same cows. One of these cows pro
duced 1000 lbs. new milk cheese.
During the first part of the season, for
two months, two quarts of ryc-meal were
given to each cow. H i f of this quantity of
meal was given them for one month during
the last of the season ; and the greater part
of the time they had their whey. 100 lbs.
pork were made on the farm ; and half of
this was crediied to the cows.
The same iudivi ual, when on another
farm in South Adams, wi'h twenty-one
cows, made 626 lbs. new milk cheese to a
cow, in a season. 1700 lbs of pork were
raised in connexion with the dairy. Half
the pork was considered due to the cows.
The process of making cheese began the
25th April, and < nded the 1st December.?
As soonns the cows calved, the cows re?
ceived three quarts of meal per day each
?principally rye, with some Indian ; and
each had some whey, though not half what
was yielded was given to them. Three or
four of the cows received meal all the sum
ms r. H commenced f jed ng again with
meal on the 25th July, and continued to
give them two quaris of meal until the 25 li
of August. On the 25rh of August, he
began feeding the cows with cornstalks until
10;h S'-ptember. Then the cows had
tho afer feed of the fields ; and from th 1st
October, these cows hi^cl nulf a load ol
pumpkins per day. In November, fed every
cow fully with meal ; two and thrt>? quarts
per day until 1st December. After that,
the cows had nothing bu1 hiy until spring.
From the same cows, at the same time, but.
tor enough was made, and milk enough
used, for a family of six persons. The
r cheese sold in New York for $10 per 100
lbs.
These products are certainly remarkable,
and show what may bo done by attention,
skill, and good treatment of the animals
under our care, Tlv pnstmagein Cheshire
is of an excellent description. The soil is
generally of a rich gravelly loam resting
upon lime.stone, and abounding in vegetable
mould. It is likewise sensitive to the
application of plaster, which is very commonly
used.

" A few days since we had a report from

"To make a cheap and wholesome table
