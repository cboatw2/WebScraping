case under consideration, even those who
had pr?icticed Ijie experiments or witnes.
sed them, spoke upon the subject with
caution, conscious from the exiraoidtnarv
developments, that ninety.nine persons
out ot every hundred, would either suppose
the operators, deceived themselves,
or worse, were anxious to deceive others.
Under these circumstances, a number
<?f highiy respectable citizens, and
among them a majority of the editors of
Philadelphia, assembled at ihothvclling of
the physician above nqUccd, on Tuesday
evening last, for tjic'purpose of being af.
lorded ocuirtr proof, There were probably
thirty gentlemen in aitenonnce beat
des the phvsician who operated, and the
individual, a friend of ours, of unblemished
intpgritv, superior intelligence and
iinvil liieil character, who consented to
b.r the subject for the evening, and wliu
hud familiarized himself with Ilio whole
scene by. former experiment. It is nol
necessary for us in this article, to express
an opinio^ as to tlie truth or falsity
ntIter of Mesmerism or Phrenology.
W e merely state facts as they passed under
our own observation, and as they u d
t?e corrrohroa'ed by sinidar accounts from
ether gentlemen u o .vere present.
The company being seated, the opera,
tor and his subject also took scats iinitio,
dlately opposite, wiicn the history of the
matter' was given in a re.v words hy the
physician, and in suhstaricc as we have
recorded it above, lie then placed his
right hand on the forehead, a..d with his
left grasped the hand cfthe patient, in
towards some fancied object, and whispered
what seemed to he the outpourings
ofa prayerful heart, The < rgan of mirth
was then touched in conjunction with
the organ of veneration, when the subject
went through a Mawwonn part, in which
wit was singularly blended with religions
advice. Some local allusions were made,
which in their association and the grave
manner in which they were uttered, were
not a little ludicrous. The organs of com
C*
bativfenyss and distructivenos produced
terrific effects, and one organ caused so
fearful a paroxysm of despair that the
subject drew a knife from his pocket and
would have used-it, had it not been taken
instantly from hnn. Acquisitiveness
and the love of children produced droll
effects?in the former, the subject evidently
taking and concealing imaginary objects?and
in the latter, nursing and carcassing
imaginary children, dandling
them on his knee, and hushing them to
deep in ihu real nursery rnni 1 style.
Those distinct effects continued about
three or four minutes nftei the finger ol
the .operator was removed from the organ,
and then subsided gradually, as if them
flpenee of some vision were heco:nin<j
fainter until it passed away ami left the
subject in a slate of magnetic sleep. Tin
first effects of the several influences, wort
preceded by slight convulsive twitching:
of the muscles, and by occasional clap
pin? of the hands*.

physician so pronounced hiin, converse:)

phreno-magnetic tests. He then exhibited
a cast with a craninin marked out
Hccoiding to the doctrines of phrenology,
and applied his (ingcr 4o the various developeirients
on the cranium of his patient.
Tlie effect astonished every one
present. All knew the char e'er o'tha
huhjoct, and therefore knew there could
he no collusion, no trh k, no deception
whatever. Bit just as the physician
touched with his finger the several specific
indications on the head of the subject,
did that subject dcvelope in the
.strongest and most unequivocal manner,
the various feelings, tastes and emotions
which penologists contend, are indicated
by pro iu he ranees. Thus,'music, language,
mirth, ideality, number, veneration,
ahmrnfiveness, firmness, time, space, desfructiveness,
envy, self-esteem, hatred
and despair?wore successively made
manifest, as well by the countenance
and the features, as by movements of the
limbs and hv oral expression. The
fidelity of the various delineations was
wonderful. We never saw them surpas
mm! on the stage and are satisfied that the
subject could not give theni with such accuracy,
in his usual condition of mind.
When under the influence of envy, for
example, the subject alluded to some ideal
ckaractcr pointed to a scene that was

into winch the object referred to
would sooner or latter plunge or he enrapped.
Again he observed that 44 going
lip was very pleasant?all very tire-?hut
that tqe higher his antagonist ascended,
the further he would have to fall." The
expression and the manner. howev? r,
were still more striking than the language.
When ideali'y wns developed, he first described
a vast plain, upon w hich a large
laxly of inihtary were moving, and then,
the operator having moved his finger,
threw his head haA and saw seraphs and
airy figures floating above him; and again,
the finger of the operator once more re
moved be stepped forward and leant over
the yawning abyss. On being questioned,
he said it was very deep, that he was
afraid to approach any closer, and that his
eye could not penetrate into its shades.
The organ of veneration was touched,
and his aspect of adoration became at
once solemn, and beautiful. With up

IART2IQU AKK IN THE ISLAND OF ST. DOMINGO.
r>y the Prig William Nelson, arrived
it New York from Port nti Prince, has ,
>een received " Le Patriot" of .May 11th, j
published at that place, which gives an 1
account of a shocking earthquake that !
occured in that island on the 7th of May, J
at live o'clock in the evening, the follow- i
ing particulars of which we copy from
the Now York Express of Saturday j
morning:
The principal destruction of life of;
which we have an account, was at Capo i
[laytien, which town was entirely do- ?
stroved. It contained about 15,009 in- J
habitants, two-thirds of whotn are thought ,
to he dead. i
The approach of the earthquake was'
indicated in Port an Prince hy great
heat, and heavy clouds that covered the J i
neighboring hills, and followed the direc- i
tion of the southwest to the northeast.

the houses agitated, which seemed to in- J
dicate that the shock cainc from the J'
west. ik
There were two shocks at Tort au J j
Prince very distinctly felt, the first not 30 I I
long as the second, which last endured
about three minutes. Every person
strove to get out of the houses, and the
streets were filled with affrighted population.
A little longer, says the Patriot, j
and Port au Prince would have been the
theatre of a disaster similar to that cf
1770, of which disastrous year the re- ,
% i
membranco was rus' ing info all minus. ;
The Patriot also says that there is i
hardly a house or a wall that has not suf- I
fored a little. Some have become almost '
uninhabitable. The front of the Senate '
house, where the arms of the Republic 3
arc sculptured, is detached and broken. , '
The interior was uninjured.
On the Saturday night succeeding and '
on Sunday there were other shocks.?
Mass was interrupted, and the persons (
present ran hither tind thither, while ( 1
many women fainted.
On Monday morning at 1*2 o'clock there '
was another shock. Tue weather all the !
while was changeable?now extreme lie.it, j
now rain, now fair, and now signs as if of a 1
storm.
On Tuesday again there was another shock; I
and since then, says the Patriot, " it s ems to j .
us that we walk upon a quaking earth." I ,
Saint Marc.-?A letter from this town I (
says that the earthquake was felt there with j ^
vio'enc-'. Many houses were seri?us!y dam- |
aged, aiid some destroyed, but no loss of life . ;
is mentioned. 3
At Gonaives the shocks were vet more
serious. The greater part of the houses were | i
overthrown. A fire broke out at the same j j
time, and there was not a drop of water in'i i
town. All the hour s that weie not burnt j
suffered from the earthquake. It was in the
streets that the writer of the letter giving this ; '
account was inditing it. The church, the j I
prison, the palace national, the treasury, and , <
the arsenal w<re all des'myi d. ! ,
This letter concludes at S A. M. by say. 1 ,
ing:
'It is on'y ha'f an hour since that we felt a i
very great commotion. At present we are i
ignorant of the number of persons killed or j
wounded. All the pri.-oners who are not ;
buried in the ruin* h ive escaped. God grant i
that Port au Prince may not have experienced
such a disister."
Capk Haytie.x.?The town of Cape Ilav"
rien lias entirely disappeared, ami with ?t two. j
thirds of the population. The families that I
could escape have fled to Fossetfe, where they 1
were without an asylum, clothing, or provisions.
The President of Hayti has given orders to
(he physicians nnri officer* or in*; noppitais io '
leave the city i muedia:ely in order to give
iiiccor 1?? lite distressed. Other aid of aii kinds
was about to be despatched by water to the
distressed.

The Earthquake in IIayti.-?On com I
paring the accounts recently received trhin !
IIayti, of the shock* of an earthquake feit
there, with the accounts of one in Louisiana,
we find many marks characteristic of a connexion
betwen the two. Both occured on j
the same (lav, (the 7 I) ills*.) The latter took !
place at three o'clock and lasted two or three j
seconds, giving cause during th sshort period,
to that com notion which caused the waters
of the lake at Catahoula to rise, during the :
space of two minutes, to more than six feet I
Accounts of the former state that, although 1
shocks were experienced at intervals during
the whole day, (even as eariv as 5 o'clock in
the morning.) yet the principal one occur d
at half-past 5 o'clock I\ M. (two hours and a
half later lh?n the one in Louisiana,) and'
lasted at least two or three minutes, during
which time its effects were awful. Though ;
thc difference of two hours and a half in time
ought perhaps to prevent our inferring that
these shocks were identical, yet there is rea. !
son enough to infer a connexion between the 1
two. Meanwhile, we shall await the nov\s o(
similar phenomena as having occured at some
of the other West India Islands, or in South !
America, at thc same date.

"An Incident in Georgia.?Some two
or three years ago the writer of this article j
stopped at a town in Georgia. Strolling j
about, lie en ered the graveyard. From a
small but chaste marble obelisk he read this
inscription:
A j
Mother's Memento
to the memory of an only son,
who fell at the massacre
of
Fannin's regiment in
Mexico.
He felt an interest to learn the history of]
its erection. The story was briefly this: A I

They continued, but Pettricb cou'd make j

I alluded 10 circumstances whereby
Pettrieh has been recently afflicted, and
which were pressing heavily on him when I
this sad event occurred.' I understand !
them to he these:
The Secretary of the Navy, some time
ago, received authority in nn act of Con- J
gross to contract for the erection of a j>e. (
Jcstn'tc the T.V' i eh:*? ''an ?h;!ufe in th |
1 ... r
Capitol rnfundo. Pettrieh was summoned ,
from Philadelphia upon the subject. The
Mtim of money placed at the Serrr tary's !
disposal for tho purpose was very limited,
barelv sufficient to pav for the naked panels,
while it was the opinion, not of tlie |
sculpt* p only, hut others, that the pedestal
required illustrative ?r,)1,ps. As it did i
not appear to he doubted that Congress !
would cheerfully appropriate a sufficient
sum to cover the cost of such illustration,
if its design were approved, Mr. '
Petrich stated tnat he would execute it
for ten thousand dollars, and it was form j
a 11 v* agreed that h? should prouuce niu ue- i
sign iti plaster, 4> to be submitted to and
approved l>v I lie Seretnry of l lie N ivy," I
With all the ardor and generosity and in- |
" i
cautiousness of genius, the sculptor so ;
shaped his arrangements as to leave liirn j
self no profit whatever in trie charge for j
payment of the naked pint-is, trusting for

Extract of a letter dated ^
Ilavanna, May 18, 1812. *
Conversing last evening with Captiart
RiiMo<. of the Soanish oolacca Roridrt, he
" W 4 I
iol(i ine I ha', in the latter part of July last*
>eing in the ln<ittir!*- of the Grand Hank#
lo descried what he thought l? he a vessel
ind called to his mate, who also thought
t was a small vessel. A little while after*
wards concluded it might ba a fishing
boat, and kept the vessel aivay for it, the
Captain, fearing it might he a rock, examined
his charts, hut finding no reef la (I
down any whore in that vicinity, and
conjecturing it might he a wreck, !>ore
down f??r it, and as they nenred, found it
was the wreck of a large vessel, burnt to
the hhtor*edge. When within a hall a
cable's length of it, they hovo the vessel
to, lowered the. boat, and Captain lloldos
went to reconnoitre the wreck. He says
it must have been a very large vessel;
and the thing which first attracted his
attention, were twolarge columns of wood,
(so he called tliom) not very far apart,
painted black about nine feet Iroin tho
bottom, and then white about three feet
to where they wore burnt o.T, and that
there were ni irks of firu also on tlio part
left standing. These "columns" projecting
above the rest of the wreck, had the
appearance, at a distance, of two small
sails. He also saw, on the bottom of the
vessel, just under water, several very
- I - - - A I
large timbers, secured sirongiv logcmer
bv iron clamps and braces of very extraordinary
size, and from these, concluded
llial it was the wreck of a large steamer
and that this hed was made to support the
boiler. lie also says, that the floor
timbers of the vessel were very heavy,
some two feet square, as near ns he can *
recollect, and very near together, not
more than four or five inches apart ; the
ends of these, as well as the flooring, or
ceiling in most places, were very much
charred.
The head and stern were gone at lc?i?t
the extreme parts, and he could not tell
how long she was originally, hut he paced
the part remaining, by stepping from one
timber to another, and thinks to the best
of his recollection it was about UO fc?t
