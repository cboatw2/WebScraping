ulous attention to the titerests of his subscri

patronage. i will ilways he his aim to spread

In appearing before the public, in the char
acter of a conductor of a journal, the question
is naturally asked, what are the principles in

will advocate, fearlessly, the cause of Demo.
cracy, having at all times aon'eye single to the
safety of our own beloved State, and its insti
tutions.
. The elevationofJAvssK. Porx.and GgoEx
M. DA.rAs, to the respective stations to which
they have been nominated by the voice of the
Democratie party, will receive our most'hear
ty support. We will ovpose the present Ta
fiff. and in fact any' other, which has for its
object the protection of the Manufacturing in
teredi; to the injury of the producers of the
gieat siap!es bf the country. 'We arenot the
adioueod bF passive submission or non-resis
tance, to uncbiistittonal.an'd oppressive legis
lation oi the part of the Federal Government,
but will be controlled ard gojerned by the
State of South Carolina,' in whatever action
she may tnke in protecting her citizens against
such measures.
We will pay sttict attention to. the interests
of the Merchants, Planters, and Mechanics,
in giving them the earliest foreign and domes
tic intelligence; in fact, nothing shall be want
ing npon our part, to render our journal in
ieresti ng and instructive to all classes of society.
F6r the information, especially of our coun
try friends, the various fluctuations in the price
of Cotton anall always be noticed, and we will
regularly publish a dorect Prices Current of
all articles of Meretisidlise in our market.
Our zeal in'deieice of our favorite pidlitical
measures, Ahall nevet lead us beydnd the limits
of con'rfeiy to daif opponents, we will endea

are born equal," and consequently entitled to
their own opiniomis uporn any subject.
We -ilt adAt into OWr olains temperate
discissions on all topicd of interest, always se
aerving to ourselved the right of excluding such
commu'nicatione, as in nur judgment may not
be suitable. . We will not permit ourselves to
be made the tool of any elique or patty, in reli
gion or politics, but will always endeavor to
support the cliaracter of an independent advo
cate of Republican principles.
