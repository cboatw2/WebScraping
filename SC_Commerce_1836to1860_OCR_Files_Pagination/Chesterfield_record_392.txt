; The brief review which we have given
i of live conduct of thn Opposition in Congress,
is in . perfect accordance with, lb*
; rcourse of Federal parly during our second
war of independence. They propose no ;
| measures, tltough professing nn earnest dosire
lo relieve the country from prevailing
1 embarrassments. They have steadily restated
every effort of the Administration to
cSrry into execution the pltfn whicb-it lias
proposed for separating the fiscal operations
oi the Government from incorporated institutions,
and winch has u direct tendency to
J restrain that dangerous,"' banking power
( which by their agency, and under the influj
once ol titter counsels, h id grown up nlmos'
| to an equality web the Government itself. I
Thus have the cons ttuied iHit!forj:i? s of the J

1 CELEBRATION AT FORT MEIGS.
The following is an abridgment of the
account of rlr's celebration furnished by the
; editor of tlie BuflMo Commercial Adverts|
*r who was present.
It having been understood that Gen.
Harrison,, who, with li s companions and
former aids, Col. To ld, and Majors Clark- j
son and Oliver, had spent the nighf preced- j
\ iriff hi S mdusky, tvouu arr.ve in mu uom
I of the same name at Toledo, in the afternoon,
the Committee of Arrangements
j delegated to a committee consisting of
Wf .ssrsT.ivk)r,C!K)u'es,.CI ij?;> an/J 3;ngg, of j
litis city, bfi<I >t detachment of the DtitfdJo !
l-Voijnl'-er Mi:rary Corps, under command j
| of.CUfit Auughn, the pleasing task of reoeiviug
the hero nnd escorting hint to Perrysbuiy.
They left in ho Perry -soon after
, our arrival, The interval between their
departure and return we spent in viewing
their localities about the Fort, and noting
i the fresh arrivals, iirnnense multitudes
I were already on tin* ground, and tticy con.
tiiiii -d to pour in by thousands. More than
i five hundred wagons come in one sing'o
f procession. The van ofthe line was formed
'by the Ricld.md County Delegation, who
Tcanie a pistanceof more than one hundred
j n?i!? s, in one hundred and twenty three
wagons. WQ ntienipted at first to pnrfic. J
: ular zj each different delegation with their
' equipages, banners, mottoes and badges,
j but*wo were soon obliged to give up in despatr.

i dusky and Perry came in sight, and as they I
i approached the lowft, the trees, the roots
i ot houses, ihe decks and rigging of the'
j steamboats ivmg at the wharves, were co'vj
ered by th? fUronging thousands anxious to
! obtain a view of the venerable chief. He
I lauded untler a salute of 17guns, fired by \
detachment of the Buffalo Frying Artillery, |
i which was responded to hy tt<e cannon on
j board each of the tenor dozen steamboats,
! and the still louder sheers of the immense
, multitude. The Gene ral was deeply affhc.
ted, but lite Idleness of lite hour and the fa.
i uguft ot the journey, precluded any thing
(bore than a sin.pie acknowledgment of die
; <iei?ioivstrations-of atfecliunate attachment
vu;h which l.o was greeted. Entering a barouche,
and preceod< d by Iris escort, ho im.

Fori, arid as ho vi wed tho scene of so J
much piivution, suffering and triumphj and
marked in their turn the spots where the
1 desperate struggle or successful sully hud
been ruiidtynjj will pardon *he sensibility
I that would not retrain a tear for the memory j
; of those who so gallantly with him man., j
tained the honor and defence of the country j
; in its hour of most iminenl peril. After j
riding slowly found the Fort, and pass ng ;
! in review, (he troops drawn up to receive i
'! him, tho General .in company with his suite, i
i r< turned to town and look up his quarters at
tho hospitable mansion of Judge Hoihstcr.
As the night came on, the old Fort pre.
seated one of the most p'cturesqne views
| imaginable. Gfrat numbers of people had
1 come in during the afternoon, from the
neighboring states of Indiana und Michigan,
and the more distant counties of Ohio, and
by 9 o'clock, thecrs could not have been less
iban 20,000 on tho ground. These were
divided into groups, of from 1,(500 to 5,000
men lis'ening to and cheering some favorite
; speaker, or singing Tippicanoe songs.
I j On the brow of the ibank, und on the
.' edge of the neighboring forest were ranged
the white twits of tlie military and nit z*ns.
II The heavens, wore without a cloud, the
. f moon was up, an l under the softened and
. : meilow radiance of its blessed light, the riv.
- er, tho valley, and the whole scene seemed
j reposing in quiet beauty, forming a tyrange
contrast to the sights and which ml the

Tne Indians were finally dr.veu back, sorrr
were cap'ured, the seutin*Is were placed
and the camp sank into profound repose.
By early dawn (he morrfng of the llih
t'w? whole population of t'.e valley of ih
Muumef, and the country in a circuit of 2!
or 3d miles, began to pour in, the hundrei
bands which accompanied the different dele
gations were playing, m. n mustered^
hundreds and thousands under their respec
tive banner*, and all proceeded to lite Fort
where, at about 10 o'clock, tho vast ttssem
blage was organized as a Convention by tin
appointment of officers:
Soon after ibcjnrganization had been thu
completed, Gen.* Harrison reached lb<
ground and ascended the stand, where wen
collected many of tho veterans of the Revo
lut'oir and his companions in arms und<*
Wayne, and during the last .war. His ap
pearance was greeted with rounds of tin
most tremendous cheer*. The thror.e o
Gruce wag then addressed in an &fl*jctio|
and appropriate prayer by the Rev. JosCpl
lludg^r, whose head was whicned by tin
frosts of some 90 winters, and who riearlj
50 years before was a chaplaindn Way ne'

Attempt m Murder on a large-scale.
A most wautoh and wickejd assault was
ately made by the Captaittof a Hudson
Steamer upon a rival boat, the following
iccount of which is taken from an article
n the N-Y. Express.
i
The De Witt Clinton is one of (he old
tSortli River line of boatsvof the ca/>aci'laanf

jpeed and comfort, we have hadytd'ten
jccasion to rpeak?and touch aT> we
egret to utter any other remarks than
those of.approval. We have been atv
:ustGmed to consider the owners and
:>tficers of this line, all "honorable men,"
and it is with sincere pain that we find
uccaion to record any facts or rumors
against any person connected with the
line}" which tend to stamp them a different
character. i
The JJapoheon is an opposition bofrt,
owned in Albany, frrnl put unon the river
with the avowed purpose, of of
reducing the fare; and with he real pOr
pose, undoubtedly, of a great number of
passengers, the same money that could
be made with fewer, at a higher price.
We have no.confidence in the universal
" opposition" humbug of public spirit;
and labor for the public good; because
we have always noticed that when 9ueh
Ubor ceases to be profitable, .the disiiiterested
laborers cease to work.?
Well, this opposition boat, a<tuaed bythe
unfriendly feedings which exist betwen
rivals of this class, on reaching
the city Saturd ty^morniog, placed herself
in t<xj way of the Clinton,, in huoh u
manner as to compel the Clinton to seek
k. J _j_ ^
auorier qock.
At5o'elpck in llie al'Tnoon the U.'Cn
Ml her pier, rind proceeded Dp the river.
The NapfiLfon also started with ;*bout feur
hundred passengers on board, lo follow.
Just as the "Nfrpolvon got abreast ofilie pier
where the Clinton laid, the lat er shot out
from the wharf, and plumped directly into
(he side of the Napoleon. The blow Caused
the .Napoleon to creen so mu<h that tin:
water is said to have run over h?r deck,
and the confusion, fright and excitement of
the pnssnngets on board was. appaling.
The shouts and screams tint went up beg.
ger description. So unexpected was tl.c
collision, or rather the assault, that .the bo!,
deston board the Napoleon lost their pres.
ence of mind.
During the confusion it is stn'vd that
the captain of the Napoh on fired at the pilot
of the De Wi:t Clinton, it is also reported,,
wounded him. The report, however, we
Iinve good reason to brieve, is incorreoit
though two if not three, shots were fired.?
After hunging together by the bo.ws a few
seconds, rt)o~bdais were disentangled?the
Napoleon slipped off, die Dn Witt struck up
Yankee Doodle, and proceeded up the river,
and the Napoleon followed, after, rcceivingnnd
returning'-three cheers from tfre crowd
on shore. - . * SPURIOUS
HALF DIMES.
A gentleman showed ug, yesterday,
some half dimes which have been pronounced
spurious coin, and it is said
there are a Considerable number of them
in circulation. They can be easily detected,
as the vignette of the Goddess of
Liberty, on the legitimate coin, is surmounted
by 13 stars, whereas the counterfeit
has not any?otherwise it would
be difficult to distinguish the one from
the other.?Char. Courier.

Whrai Crop in Western Michigan.-*-Extract

A regret to say that the army vermin is <fe-9
^yt^g thousands of acres of a* good growth
sof wheat as human eye ever beheld. The fly
works some. Where' the growth indicated .
thirty bwheb per acre threo weeks ago, now <?
the farmers say ib wfll not be worth harvesting,
R-qin all sides of us the complants are general
?wherever the worm fl?, the wo k of deat?j<L
fion 'is complete?-people. are mO'wing dbirn
whole fields for fodder." r
The above is confirmed by several gentle,
mqn, who bsvc recent ly; travelled through
western Michigan, with whom'we haveeooi
versed. There can be no doubt that immense ?
quantities of growing wheat liaVe been de.
stroyed in thai quarter.
It fortunately happens, however, that so .
much wheat was sown last fail, that a failure
ofthe crop in. any particular district cannot affect
the general result:?Buffalo Com. Adv.

"I might say with truth, that the Bank
owes as much to me, as to any othetin- I
dividual in the country; and 1 might
everf add that, had it not been for -ray ^
efforts, it would not have been chartered.

k%It is s ?id that the Bank had no agen
cy, or at least no efiicinnt agency, in
the restoration of specie, paynients in
I9f7, agd th|? it has failed to furnish
the country with a uniform and solid
currency, as had been promised at iTs
creation. Both -of these allegations I
pronounce to be without just foundation. .
To enter into a minute examination of
thein would carry me too far from the
subject, and I inust content myself with v- saying,
that having-beeR on the political
stage without interi action, from that day
Jhr this?having been an attentive observer
of the question of the currency
throughout the whole period?that the
Bank has 'been&n- indispensable agent iu

without it the restoration could not have >.
been effected, short of the utter prostration
of all the moneyed institutions of
rhe country; and an entire depreciation
of Hank paper; artel that it has not only
| restored specie payments, but has given
a currency far more uniform, between the

Tl^e yearly predictions as to the pr<-spective
character of -the "Crops,1' are
generally on the gloomy side. VVe have

woi'iftr-*and the evidence is indisputable.
We have conversed -with many from
Fayette and lie adjoining counties, of
whqm but one expects an average cropami
-the rotat do-not libpc for more than
h.ilfof it. We notice.simiIar reports from a
Ohio, Virginia, Indiana and I'ennsyivania.
VVe are told that in some parts of
this county tire rains.of last week did
great injury to the hemp, s'o much, that
many are ploughing their fields, sortie.

to plant corn. This is a gloomy prospect.

o' last yeai^ may supply

sufficient dry weather to enable us to
I conquer the weeds in the corn, and to

Strange Women in Sweden.?A simple
minded old dame, residing near Rdinburg,
was attentively listening to her
grandson reading a statistical account of
the proportions of males to'females in
various portions of the world* She easily
comprehended how that in Great
Britain the women exceeding the_ men
by six in a hundred, and in Spain by
one fn a thousand; but when it was stated
that in Sweden the females exceeded
the m les by seven and a half in every
hundred, she exclaimed, "l?h? preserve
