The Frovitier Wet.-A correspondent
ofthe New York Journal of Commerce
gi-es -ti amusing description of manners
and doings on the remote frontier of the
West. The introduction of judicial au
thority and forms into the wilderness of
Iowa some years ago is illustrated by the
following story
lowa isnow the finest frontier country
io-the West,4and is setting up very fast.
Judge Williams related to me some amu
sitigseenes that he witnessed, when he
irsttarted on his circuit, for the purpose
Wlorganizing and holding his efirt courts
- Whong the rude frontier people. In many
*C'unties the had not had time even to
eieit any kind of a shelter for a court
QIionse. The best provision which could
Li-beimade, was to form seatsof logs beneath
1iihiidie-ofra large tree, with a raised
.seat'near its tiodgfr the Judge. The
Sherifl~ould:pean rt by mounting a
sitdMp, OrMur ;ndear by, and crying
"O yes, oh yes," 4o uaionuncing to the
, wholenontversethat thaecourt was then o
..pened, and inviting alleWb had business
toattend. The Clerk sat o1_ abloek' of
- wood, and I- used a ;bingle-on his knee for
a desk. After the Grand Jury were em
panelled, and charged by the Judge they
were sent in care of the Sheriff to a large
hollow or ravine, in which they could 'ir
in conclave beyond the view of the court
or spectators. A smaller hollow, or ra
vine, was appropriated for the use of th
PetitJury.
The grass grew very tall in the neigh
borhood, and if the Jurymen lay down in
a ring in the grass, they could still more
perfectly exclude themselves from obser
vation. The Judge said that, one day af
ter having charged the Grand Jury. and
dismissed them to their quarters in the
large hollow a tall ra -boned, live Yun
kee lookig man, with hat in hand, ad
dressed him as follows: "May it please
your honor, I wish to speak to you."
"Order sir, what is it?" "Judge," continu
ed he, with the utmost gravity, "is it right
for fellows to siake it in the grass?" "Hon
what is that sir?"-"Why you see." said
the Yankee, "there's some f.llows who's
tarnel fraid the Grand Jury will find some
thing agin 'em, which they desarve, and
they are snaking up to the Grand Jury, on
their bellies in the grass, kind of trying to
hear what the Jury are talking about. "No"
responded the Judge, with as much gravity
as he couht command, "I do not allow of
"Snaking"-Here Mr. SherilI, go station
a guard round each Jury's hollow and if a
man is found "Snaking," have him brought
before me and I will cause him to-be purr.
ished. Indeed, if this "Snaking," is per
sisted in, I shall recommend a special Act
to be passed, making it a misdemeanor."
The fact was, the Judge said, there evere
present at the time, some barefooted
vagrant rascals, who were probably justly
suspected of horse stealing and had -snaked
it," on the Grand Jury, in order to find out
whether the Jury intended to present them
and if so to gain.time by this clandestine
warning .and -flee-the jurisdiction of the
Court by. escaping into Missouri. He re
lated many other curious scenes, which I
have not time to repeat.

-a cob:est between the free States and
the Southern and Western Slaveholding

factores counted the probable cost of such
a conflict? If they have not, they should
do so at once. The West and South can
get along uwch better without the East
and North, than the East and North can
without the West and South. Let those
who seem so willing to wage war upon
our interests, institutions, and rights, re
collect that we have iron, coal, hemp, cot

all the elements ofcommerce and manu

and superior fertility of our soil will very

control of the Union; and we may be just

We feel confident that our Northern and
Eastern brethren are too patriotic to assail

The profuse use of nick-names and oth

public men is a remarkable trait in our
political literature. We certainly have
greatly improved in the phraseology of
Journalism within a very recent period.

not find these beauties of taste in almost
every line. But party imagination up

than a dexterous.play on proper names.
The most ludicrous combinations-the
oddest compounds sparkle, like gema of

has shoi n a high degree of inventive tal

singular aptitude in the frabrication of
phrases tending to th-row odium on politi
cal opponents. Now if these instances of
preverted taste and unmamiered contro

that the parties employing these beauties

Climate for Consumptives.-It is a nat
ier of much interest in this countryi where
consuMption is a prevalent disease, to ds
certain the climate most favorable to persons
afflicted with pulmonary affections.
Some parts of Florida are said to be
unrivalled for the equable temperature of
the atmosphere and for that mild and genial
climate most conducive to the restoration
of health incipiant stages of consumption,
and best adapted to the prolongation of
life where the lungs have received incurable
injuries.
Dr. Wilson, a highly respectable physi
clan of Jackson. Miss., who is himself con
sumptive. and has visited Cuba, Jamaica,
and other West India Islands. and various
parts of South A merica, gives it as his own
opinion that the Island of Curacoa is the
best place for persons in his condition. It
is in 12 degrees north latitude and 66 de
grees west longitude, lying in the course of
the trade winds, which vary from N. E. to
S. E., from which points the breeze is
always soft and refreshing. He arrived
there on the 1st of February and remained
until the 6th of April, during which time
ite thermometer stood at its lowest point
79 degrees, and at its highest 83, the usual
change in twenty four hours not exceeding
three degrees, a change not felt by the
most delicate constitution, In Cuba, par
ticularly. the Doctor's health rapidly de
clined the climate being exeessively varia
ble; but the mild and uniform temperature
of Curacoa entirely restored him.
Going through the Motions.-There was
a fellow who unfortunately for himself and
family; from being a pretty good husband
took to drinking, and soon became an idle
and trifling vagabond. Coming home one
night after having, as usual been on a de
bauch, he begun to call lusily-"Wife!
wife! I say give me some supper! Iaiy
give me some supper!" The pooor wife
who, while she could do so, provided food
for the family by her own toil, informed
him with tears in her eyes. that there was
nothing to get a supper out of. "What,"
said he, "hav'nt you a piece of cold meat
"No." "Give me a ernst of bread, then
He was told- there was none. "What!
have you nothing-VoTHING ?" "Nothing
at till," replied the poor wife, rnot even a
crumb !" After a pause--Very well,
very well ! Give me a clean plate, knife
and fork. By Jupiter! l'llgo through
the motions any hot if I starve afterwards.
There is more reality than romance in
the subjoined extract from a capital little
story in a late number ofthe Knickerbock

knew that her lover had scraped his moth

only make her a foe for life by the really

and the evidence of her own senses into
the bargain. Besides, if you could by
some miracle, convince her, you would ae
complish nothing, for she forgives even

A curious instance of the intelligence of
a dog is relatedl. The animal belonged to
a celebrated chemist, who tried upon it the
ehethc of a certain poison, and upon the
next day admnitstered a counter-poison,
which had the effect of preservi-ng the
poor creature''s life. The next day an
other dose was offered hitm; btut nerei!
said he, he would niot touch it. Different
sorts of poisonous drugs were presented to
himn, but he resolutely refused all. Bread
was offered, but he wotuld not touch it ;
meat, but he turned from it ; water, but he
would not drink. To re-asswre him,. his
master offered him bread and meat of
which he himselfaue in the dog's presence;
and of that the sagacious amimal, hesitated
not to partake. He was taken to a foun
tain, but he would drink nowhere hut from
the spot where the wvater gushed free and
fresh. This contiaued for several days,
until. the master, touched? by the extraor
dinary intelligence of the poor creature, re
solved to make no more attempts upon
him with his poleont,. The dog is now

Republican, a red squirrel was seen on a
maple tree standing by the house of Mr.
Seth Smith, in West Sring~eld,, he had
been there but a few mninutes biefore war
wvas declared against him by an old robin,
who seemed to claim the right of~ posses

dertook to make his eseape along a range
of maples by the way-side; but fitnding
the bird in hot pursuit, he would turn oe
casionally and put himself on the defen

bird. ~ Hie then ran up and down several
trees, with the enemy at his heels, some
times stopping to strike with his paw, and
then resumipg his retreat. At last he ran

the report shall distinctly state whether

Allum Spring Pills,
for the Cure of )yspepsia, Scrofulus and
Liver Diseases.
T HESE PILLS are prepared by Dre
S. R. Campbell, from the water of
the highly celebrated Mineral Springs in
Rockbridge county Virginia, called the
Alum Springs.
These Pills, like the water from which
they are prepared, are a diuretic, promot
ing the secretion of urine and an alterative,
increasing the secretions of the glandular
system generally, and particularly or the
liver. They act gently, but effectually
upon the bowels, alter two or tbree days'
use of them, producing copious dark, bil
lious evacuation.
They also effect a determiiation to the
surface, increasing the perspiration ; there
fore, they are a great purifier of the blood,
and equaliser of the circulation. Each
pill is equal to a common glass of the wa
ter. They should be taken before each
meal, and from six to ten or twelve should
be taken in the course of each day, for a
fortnight, and then omit them for the same
periods For the cure of the above diseas
es, perseverance in the use of these Pills,
is all important; and if t hey are persever
i ingly used, every alternate fortnight, a cure
may more certainly he expe:ted, than un
der any other 'reatment heretofore disco
vered, except from the use of the water,
from which they are prepared, eiher by an
attendance at the Springs or otherwise.
They very speedily cure diarrhoeas, at
tended with acidity of the stomach, and
are n very useful remedy for the summer
bowel complaint in children. as also- for
expelling worms fron children. From one
