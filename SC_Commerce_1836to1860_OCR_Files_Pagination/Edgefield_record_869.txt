Niew OxRizass, Oct. 21.
From Mexito.-By the arrival of th
schr. Virginia Antoinette, we have recei
vod papers from the city of Mexico-to lb
28th. uIt. and from Vera Cruz to the 3c
inst. The Hesperia of the 21st states tha
President Sania Anna had. granted pet
mission to Gen. Sentmanat's family to ex
hume his remains and transport them t
New Orleans.
The papers. publish the particulars c
the outrage committed on the petson c
Tazieer, the French sailor. It appeare
he was beaten cruelly and maltreated ii
the most infamous manner. The Mexical
papers are attempting to show that Taziee
is a "naturalized Mexican." and canno
therefore claim the protectiou of France.
A British sloop of war lay in the barho
waiting an arrival ofspecie, a number
vessels were also lying outside the ha
bound in, but owing to the prevalence o
north winds, no communication had beei
had with the shore for twenty days. Thi
village of Tusban, about 60 miles South o
Tampico, was nearly destroyed on the is
instant by a severe gale.
President Santa Anna hUs issued a cir
cular stating the conditions upon whici
foreigners are allowed to enter the Repub
lie by way of the Frontiers. 1st. The]
must enter the country by one of theplacei
designated for the trade with the Unitet
States. 2d. All passports are to be pre
sented to the Custom House Collector a
such a point. 3d. A formal acknowledge
ment of submission to the laws and author
iies of the nation, during his residence it
the country.
No passport can embrace more than on
person, except such as are delivered tc
fathers of families, which may includt
their wives and sons under 16 years.
The preceding articles apply to all for
eigners travelling by the places indicted
No passport will be delivered save foi
one designated point, and can only serve
for such place.
The fifth article states the formalities tc
be observed by the Custom House Col.
lectors
The sixth provides for the expnlsion o
all foreigners who may obtain permissior
into the territory by other means than those
pointed out in the preceding articles.
.Those fore ogns..wjongghave co1in
into thecontry, prnor to the promulgatioi
of this decree, are allowed to remain, pro.
vided their conduct.has been irreproach
ables and they have complied with the
laws relating to residence of foreigners
otherwise they are subject to expulsion
within a delay not exceeding six monihs
A deciee has been propised by the Min
ister of Finance closin to foreigo vesselt
all other ports 6f the epuiblic save thost
of Vera Cruz, Santa de Tamaulipai
(Tampico,) Campeachy and Acapulco
Foreign commerce can be carried 6u it
the other ports but exclusively by Mexicar
vessels.
By the brig J. W. Huntingtla. fron
Vera Cruz. we have our regular files frorr
the Mexican capital. The information re
ceived some days since by the way o
Havana, of the liberation of the remain
ing Texian prisoner., is confirmed. Twc
of them, F. J.Smith and William MeMatI
have arrived. We unaderstatd that thi
whole number we're released,.. ecept v
Spaniard named Alverez. What souh
be his fate was :not known. The U. S
shooner Woodbury, which sailed fron
Galveston on the 80th inst., having ot
board Mr. Green, bearer of Governmen
dispwches, had not arrived at Vera Crm
on the E.h inst., nor was any Americai
vessel of war at Sacrifeios.-Five Frenel
vessels, two British vessels and a Spanisi
ship were at anchor at the fsland. Noth
ing new tochtng the war against Texas.
Foreign.a-We have look through th<
English papers, which come by the lat
packet, but find very little of interest i
them.
The London spectator winds up a lanj
article by saying, that "there are but thre
chances rof-peace for any English Govern
ment--tO bear.e the trouble patiently til
O'Connell die ; to pension him off, whic
eol only be done at all by doing it i
every sense handsomely; ;or by beating
him at his own trade,- and driving hiti

Soit seems, tht the Tory 'party ther
as here, rely upon the gullibility of th

that after they have stadly addconstanl
advanced in the consummiation of their oli
jects, that-the Irish people can. now b
flfattered, cajoled, or forced from their pur
poses. O'Connell may die,-be pefsiond
or cease. to agitate, but there are, thos
who will still carry forwrard the cause

speaking, I meat brevity and clearness to
make ourselves easily understood by eve
ry body, and in as few words, as the mat
ter will admit of. is the best.
Prefer the aged, the virtuous, and the
knowing, and choose those who excel, for
your company and friendship, but despise
not others.
Return no answer to anger, unless with
much meekness, whichoften turns it away.
but rarely make replies, less rejoinders;
for that adds fuel to the-fire. It is wrong
titme to vindicate yourselves, the true ear
being then never open to hear it. Men
are not themselves, and know-not well
what spirits they are o; silence to passion,
prejudice and mockery is the best answer,
and often conquers what resistance in
flames.
Leard and teach your children fair wri
ting, and the most useful parts of mathe
matics,.and some business when young,
whatever else they are taught.
Cast up your incomes and live on hall;
ifyou can, one-third; reserving the rest for
ca.sjaliies, charities, portions.

next to sin, avoid daintiness, and choice

if it be not evil itself, it is -% temptation to
it, and may be accounted a nest for sin to
btood in.
RathAr Courious.-Mr. C. F. Mills, of
our city, on Saturday last exhibited to us
some specimonts of Lemont taken from a
tree in his garden. Then were evidently
sir diutinct crops. The first was quite
large, measuring 10 inches in circutnfer
ence, jest tinged with yellow, and from a
bloom oF last January. The second, 7
inchesin circurference, deep green, ard
from a sloom of July. The third about
25 incies in circumference-the fourth
about ai inch-the fifth just formed with
a part dther bloom yet adhering thereto
-whilk the sixth specimen was a cluster
of budsaust developing into blooms. We
have ofen seen :wo & three crops upon
the sane tree but not more. If the oh
servatiom and experience of any of our
friends dfers from ours we would be
glad to 16tow. In this case there is no mis
take abist the fact. The tree at Mr.

The Soithern Mail.-T here wks no.
mail received in this city to day .frombe-,
yond Petersburg, Virginia; therefore we,
have no further returns of the South Caro
lina Election.
All the anxieig we feel about that elec -
tion is t learn whetber there is a -Wiig,
in that State.:-We have the returns from;
three congressional districts, and the word
"whig" is not in them. Afoot passenger,
who arrived here to-day by the Pirdmont7
line, reports that a Whig was lately seen:
in one of the back 'ounties of South Caro
ling ; but his. story is believed by th.e
Whigs only; The Democrats are confi
dent that if such an animal was seen
theie he was not a resident of the State,
but a wandering pipdayei, who got be
wildered in Georgia, and is now trying to-.
get into Tennessee or -North Carolina be-:
fore the presidential electioir.. If he - gets.
into Tennesteoj. he:willgeottainly get slii
ned there, and so bady,. too,-that "his.
hide will not hold shicks.-W ethinkthei
only chance he has to save his hide is to'
aee to the mountains of Buncombe,.Norti
Carolina, and even' then he will ,beain
great danger, for our letters from thai
State say, " Old Rip is waking up. lt-w
supposed that he smells the animal, for be.
has given one sneeze, and has t6tde'd
partly over on his right side."-Globe.
Cheap Poslage.-The leaders of the
Whig party are determined to have cheap
postage for their political correspondence,
fare as it may witlh the community
at large. In addition to the millione
of tracts printed in this city, and the othei
combustib'e, such as Clay bread, &c.
'orwarded to all parts of the Union, under
the franks of Senator Barrow, and the
Hon. Messrs. Causin, Garret Davis, and
Willis Green, we understand that large
nimbers of letters are received by the
committee, or its chairm'an, free of pos
tage of course, and then franked to their
destination. An instance of this occured
in the letter-of the "Great Embodimeit"
himself. to Cassius Marcellus.. Clay,"
which was first sent to Washingron, and
having received the imprimatur o4 the
Hon. Willis Greeg, was then forwarded,
kn this way, the Department has beet
defrauded out ofa vast amount of revemg.
We learn that a draft on a post offie in

Annexation.A daubt Settlid.-Oui
anxious desires Pofrthe'annexation of Tex
as have kept us constantly- alive to eyery
thing that - might revent or delay the
consumption of that' great measure. It
was said that Dr. Jones,- the President
elect of Texas was opposed to annexation.
We are happy to find that the rumor was
groundless. The followitig etract from
a letter of Dr. Jones himself,"in the Na
shows that it was propagated for political
tional Vindicator, published at" Houston,
efTect, and he prononnces it "a base -slan
der:"
Da- JoNE'Ss LETTER.-The Harrisdn,
Times orthe 25th July, says, By the
politeness of a friend, we were favored.a
few days since, with the perusal of a let
ter written to himself by Dr. Jones We
make a short extract from the letter,
wherein the Hon. Secretary expressed the
impossibility of his being able to visit the
people previous to the election.
"'Where I to make a tour through the
country, I should either be compelled to
neglectjnyofficial, matters or to resign.
Thelatter'would, indeed, be very easy;
but in the present crisis of our negotia
tions, it would, perhaps, look like a deser
tion of my post. I am not yet without
hopes of annexation, and as I have had a
great deal to do in this matter. I have
some pride in wishing to go 'through with
It. The charge that I am inimical to
further negotiations with the United States
for the re-annexation of otr country to
that,' is wholly without foundation in fact,
and a base slander.' "-Young Hickory.
Silas Wright on Ters.-It has been
urged by the Whigs that Silas Wright is
strongly opposed to the annexation of
Texas to the Union. It will be seen by
the following how far they are correct in
this statement :
"I do believe that in national points of
viewtbe annexation of Texas would he
important to the Union, that our southern
border woulJ be improved and strengthened
and secured. It is a question which pub
lic opinion should pass upon, and their
servants should obey that opiniov and will.
Candor requires that I shoufd go a step
further. From the observation I have
made-ad I have endeavored to make it
calmly, and without prejudire or bias-1
believe there is a growing inclination
among the people of tis country to ex
tend our border in that direction. eind I
have now little doub; that if we li-ve' in
that quiet arrd prosperity which we hope
foy, but a few years will pass over until
we shall see the Union indisputably andI
believe peaceably and, honorably,'embra
eing bioth Gregon~ and Texas. As to the
Oregon territory, I have no more doubt of
our tight to it, titan [ have that New York
is a part of the Union. I lhave thserefore
acted, nifornly -acted, Mi your represen
tative gh favor of putting an end 'to the
common occupancy between us and Eng
land, and extending at once Ou'r p'oWetandf
jurisdiction over tham country."
