forms and ceremonies at a]]. Nothing was said
about much water or little water. They were
brought to the spiritual discernment of their lost
and ruined moral estate; were pointed* to Christ,
f the mediator between God and man, and the only
saviour from sin; were graciously enabled to believe
on his name; found pardon and the comforting wit
ness of it; had their hearts renewed and filled with
the love of God; and will doubtless, as the tree
has been made good, bring forth the fhiits of holi
ness and in the end receive everlasting life. This
I take to be apostolical Christianity, if the New
^ Testament iB to be trusted. And one such revival
■ is worth ten thousand arguments in proof of the
■ divine sanction upon any church.
■ The meeting was not only marked by great dis
f plays of spiritual, heart-affecting power, but by uni
| form and admirable good order, It might have
been protracted much longer had the strength of
the ministers held out Immediately after its close
a temperance meeting was called, and eighty-one
took the total, abstinence pledge. Here the tem
perance cause, which oftentimes is the forerunner of
a revival, fell naturally and gracefully into the
wake of this revival,—was one of its first fruits.
Another fruit, Mr. Editor, is the subjoined list of
* new subscribers to the Southern Christian Advocate,
which though not as large as that sent you by my
good friend, brother Huggins, from the Georgetown
revival, is yet evidence that we are doing some
thing in that line. I should be ashamed to send you
L as long an account of a revival as this without some
' new subscribers as collateral testimony of the good
ness and genuineness of the work.
And now, let the name of the Lord of hosts
be pAiped. The crowning glory of the work iB
that it is divine. Otherwise it were nothing worth.
In about four weeks, 432 have been admitted on
trial in our communion; the prospect is still good;
. and I trust we shall see even “ greater things than
these.” Your affectionate brother.

DECATUR CIRCUIT, GEORGIA CONP.
Brother Wightman,—It will rejoice the hearts
of many of your readers, no doubt, to learn that a
1 gracious revival of religion has taken place at old
Wesley Chapel, on this Circuit. Brother Clark
and myself commenced a meeting there, on the 17th
June, in a settlement heretofore distinguished for
the prevalence of infidel sentiments. At the be
ginning of our meeting, no indications of special
i interest appeared. The next day, some signs of
life shewed themselves, and seven or eight persons
approached the altar of prayer. On Monday, there
were three conversions, and six applied for admis
sion into the church. The meeting now became
more and more interesting, the feeling deeper and
. more general, until the place became awful on ac
f count of the presence of God. Old and young min
1 > gled their tears and supplications for mercy. A
mong these were persons of the highest respecta
l bility and intelligence in the community. The
meeting was protracted until the night of the 26th.
We were much aided by the labours of Dr. Hamil
ton, brother Tippet of the No. Ca. Conference ;
' brothers Thomas and Simmons, and Dr. Longstreet.
Their witness is with God, and their record on high.
Every thing considered, this was one of the best
meetings I ever attended. Fifty-nine persons were
admitted on trial into the M. E. Church, and as
many, or more, were happily converted to God.
There are now to be found but few in this cornmu
nityf who are not either converted, or earnestly
seeking the knowledge of salvation. To God be
• all the glory. The Lord reigns, and we are glad.
Affectionately yours, Morgan Bellah.

FORT GAINES CIRCUIT, GA. CONF.
Dear Brother,—We have been favoured with a
gracious work of God on this circuit. A four-days
meeting was commenced at Fort Gaines, on the 8th
June, which however was kept up for fifteen days, so
encouraging were the signs of the time. Sixty
Jive persons have been admitted on trial in our com
munion as the “fruit” of the meeting. May their
names be recorded in “the book of life.” An
awakening influence has gone out upon the com
munity. and the usual manifestations of such a
state of feeling are witnessed in the willingness of
a great many to approach the altar of prayer. There
have been seen many instances of clear and satis
factory conversion. IIow adorable is the “ good
ness” of the blessed “spiritof God” who is ever
present to kill and make alive,—to give the sense
of guilt, and then, as soon as Christ is apprehend
ed by a realizing faith, to remove it;—to witness
with the blood, and give the joyous sense of pardon.
Here, as every where else where the great peculi
arities of gospel truth are preached, the great in
ward changes described in the New Testament are
realized.
Our beloved Presiding Elder, brother Steagall
was with us in the early part of the meeting, The
Rev. Mr. Smith of the Presbyterian Church, and
several of our local Preachers have rendered us
I their valuable aid in the pulpit and at the altar. On
the circuit generally our prospect is good for a gen
eral revival of religion. About 140 have been ad
mitted on trial. To God alone be the glory, since
it is all of “ grace.” In evidence that we are im
proving, I send you several new subscribers.
Very affectionately,
June U4. T. D. Peurifot.
GENERAL INTELLIGENCE.
FOREIGN.
The Anti-Corn-Lav League.—On Monday, an
attempt waa made by the Council of the Anti-Corn
Law League to get up a demonstration in the City
of London. The meeting was held at the Hall of
* Commerce, Threadneedle-street, and the bankers,
merchants, and traders of the City were specially
invited to attend, it being announced that the Earl
of Ducie, Mr. T. M. Gibson, M. P., Mr. R. Moore,
and Mr. James Wilson would deliver addresses
against the corn-law; but neither Mr. M. Gibson,
M. P., nor Mr. James Wilson were present; and
but for the fortunate arrival of Mr. Cobden, M. P.,
the whole affair would have gone off without the
eclat of the usual number of speakers. Mr. G.
Wilson being appointed to the chair, the Earl of
Ducie, after some remarks from the chairman, com
menced tire proceedings, who was followed by Mr.
G. Moore, and Mr. Cobden, M. P., concluded the
business of the day. The hall, during the whole
time, was not more than half full.—Standard.
The Chinese Collection.—We are pleased to
hear from an authentic source, that the public has
bestowed an immense amount of patronage upon
this institution, at Hyde Park corner;—no less
than a hundred and fifty thousand persons having
visited it since it was first opened in London,—in
cluding the following distinguished and fashionable
personages, during the last week :—Her Majesty
the Queen Dowager and suite, her Grace the
Duchess of Buckingham, the Duke and Duchess
of Argyle, Earl Fitzwilliam, the Earl and Countess
of Harrington, Lady Arabella Coote, Dowager Lady
Brownlow, Admiral Sykes, Sir James and Lady
Clarke, Lady Elizabeth Camperdown ahd party,
Sir William Chatterton, Captain Alste'ad, R. N.,
Mr. Fitzgerald and party, &c. &c.
British InterArencE in Liberia.—The Phil
adelphia Colonization Herald states that “English
cupidity’’ is hankering after Liberia. A new map
of Africa has been got out, on which a claim is laid
to a large portion of the Liberia Territory. Mr.
Arrowsmith, the royal geographer, told an associate
of the editor of the Herald, tnat the map was com
manded by high authority. The article concludes
with stating that a Committee of Parliament, who
have been taking testimony the past year as to Li
beria, are gathering all the testimony they can
adverse to the rights of the present Governors, and
thatthe report of the Committee recommends to the
British Government the construction of a fortress
in the very heart of Liberia. The writer says:
“The fate of the Niger expedition has dissipated
the dreams of the commercial aggrandizement in
dulged by Britain, previous to the failure of that
pseudo-philanthropic speculation. Liberia now
offers the most safe, direct, and desirable access to
the great valley of the Niger; and we much fear
that the insatiable rapacity of England will disre
gard every obstacle to her obtaining for her starving
manufacturers and clamorous merchants the mono
poly of that important market. We have hitherto
addressed our appeals to the philanthropist and the
Christian. We now earnestly commend this im
portant subject to the most serious consideration of
the American patriot and statesman. .
The Loss of the Presibent.—Upon this ques
tion as many theories have been raised, perhaps as
have occurred upon any topic agitating the public
mind for many years. Although but a private ship,
the continued mystery of her non-appearance—the
distinguished positions held by some of the parties
known to have been on board her,—the important
link that she formed between the Old World and
New all tended to make her prolonged absence a
matter of the deepest interest ana discussion in
every circle. So long a period has elapsed since the
insurance companies nave paid for her supposed loss,
that the interest in her fate had subsided. A great
sensation has, however, been produced throughout
all naval and mercantile circles by the announce
ment thatthe new work by the popular author of
“ Cavendish,” called—“ The Lost Ship,” is indeed
nothing less than a story based upon the voyage of
the President from New York to England, and throw
ing a startling light upon that most interesting sub
ject.—London paper.
Mr. Brunnel Recovered.—Mr. Brunnel, whose
life was endangered by the dropping of a piece of
coin into the windpipe, after several attempts to
remove it by Sir Benjamin Brodie, was finally re
lieved on the 13th of May. An attempt to remove
it by the forceps by means of an opening in the
windpipe, was unsuccessful.—Several attempts
were made to remove the coin by placing the body
I of the patient in an inverted position, the last of
which proved successful. He was placed on an
apparatus, prepared for the purpose, his body inver
ted, and the back gently struck. After two or three
coughs, he felt the coin quit its place, and in a few
1 seconds, it dropt from his mouth.
Mexican Indemnity.—The amount paid by the
Mexican Government, $270,000, which has arrived
at New Orleans by the Dolphin, is for the interest
due on the awards made by the Prussian empire un
der the mixed commission, to whom the claims of
American citizens against Mexico were referred.
The first instalment of the principal will be due
about the last of July, and the general impression
amongst the best informed merchants of Vera Cruz,
is that the payment will be punctually made.
Little’s Poems.—Thomas Moore, who in early
life published some poetry under a feigned name,
whose distinguishing characteristic was sensuality, is
said in his more mature years, to have frequently
expressed his sorrow at having written them. A
friend once asked, “When did you first regret having
written these poems, Mr. Moore 1” “ When I had
a daughter old enough to read them,” was the em
phatic reply.
Campeachy.—There were two arrivals yesterday,
but they bring but little information. We under
stand that since the conclusion of the armistice
between the Vucatcco and Mexican forces, that all
the Mexican sail vessels, including an American
merchant vessel recently purchased, have left, and
only the Guadaloupe and Montezuma steamers were
off- Lerma. It is reported also, that Commodore
Moore does not consider himself bound by the truce,
and holds his vessels ready according to his orig
inal determination, to give the Mexicans battle the
first oppportunity.—-V. Orleans Bulletin.
A man, named Edward Ilavlin, a clerk inthc Gen
eral Post Office, has been committed for trial, on a
charge of appropriating to himself the contents of
three money letters, one of which was directed to
Mr. Thomas Corbett, Broomyard, Down, Hereford
shire.
DOMESTIC.
Improvements in the Microscope.—An individ
ual in South Leicester, Mass., has communicated to
the editor of the Worcester Spy, some astonishing
improvements as having been made by him in the
Solar Microscope. His improvements consist in
representing on the screen the entire object with
equal power, and in all the brilliancy of nature’s
coloring. He thus describes the operation of his
instrument:
“ I cannot refrain from mentioning a metamor
phose which I was happy enough to witness through
the agency of our instrument. I had placed the lar
vae of a May Ply under the action of 3,000,000 pow
ers, which gave a representation on the screen 12
feet long. While watching the movements of its
breathing apparatus I perceived the head to be leav
ing the body,or rather drawing another body with it
from within the one I was examining. In a few se
conds four legs were thrown out (as one would
throw out the frame of an umbrella) and floated on
the surface of the water,—the insect now measured
20 feet, and a more singular nondescript cannot be
examined than was presented in this half aquatic
of existence. Extending from a few feet back of
the head to the extremity of the body, as far as it
had drawn out, appeared on either side what seemed
an ill-furled sail, which by an effort of the insect
was immediately flung to the breeze,—and lo! a
stupendous pair of wings was added to the scene.
The old envelope floated away, and before me flut
tered a thing of air ! The entire time, from its
larvte state swimming in my receiver till it floated
away on wings, did not exceed 3 minutes, I never,
in the wildest flight of imagination, conjured up a
sight so amazing as this.
“ There are peculiarities about our instrument
which I am not at liberty to mention at present. I
will state, however, that in the arrangement and
combination of lenses and speculie, we have, in ma
ny instances, worked directly opposite to the funda
mental laws that have been supposed to govern op
tion Henry M. Paine.”
The Bunker Hill Celebration.—The New
York Courier and Enquirer of Monday says:—
This celebration has gone off gloriously, and so
far as we have accounts from Boston, with an eclat
fully equal to expectation, high as it had been raised
by the well known character of the Massachusetts
Metropolis, for conducting such a pageant with a
taste and judgment calculated to give it the most
imposing effect. The day was as fine as could
have been desired, notwithstanding the unfavourable
augurieBof the weather on Friday and tho numbers
who rushed into Boston to witness the ceremo
nies of the occasion appeared to have exceeded even
the previous anticipation. The military portion of
the pageant was in the, highest degree grand, not
only in numbers but in the drill and discipline of its
material; the arrangements civic and military were
equally admirable in their design and in the steady
and orderly manner in which they were carried out.
The address of Mr. Webster was worthy of the occa
sion and of his own distinguished reputation, and
though we have not seen or heard an opinion ex
pressed of it as a whole, there can be no doubt of its
entire character.
Livino upon Air-—A queer idea has somehow
got abroad that periodical-proprietors, paper-makers,
printers, pressmen, and all the multifarious vivipa
rous, warm-blooded animals connected with pub
lishing matters, share the properties of the camele
on. There can be no greater mistake than this.
Whatever theories may exist upon the subject, it is
a well ascertained fact that none of these classes
of people are exempt from the ordinary laws of
humanity, but are compelled, in order to preserve
their vitality, to repair the waste of nature from time
to time with substantial aliment. But this zoological
absurdity is not more preposterous than another
dogma which seems to obtain among some of our
delinquent agents and subscribers. They seem to
think that a periodica] is one of the lower order of
vegetables, which, when once planted, grows and
flourishes of itself, and drops its blossoms and fruits
at their door without any expense of care and cul
ture. How such a stupid belief can obtain curren
cy among people so enlightened we are wholly at a
loss to determine ; but we earnestly hope that every
one of our subscribers to whom the suspicion at
taches of sharing such laughable ignorance, will at
once exonerate himself, and prove his undoubted in
telligence by forwarding the funds, which will
enable us to go on cheerfully, administering to his
entertaiment and delight in these columns.—Mirror.
Laughable Adventure.—During the past win
ter, a reverend clergyman in Vermont, being ap
prehensive that the accumulated weight of the
.snow upon the roof of the barn might do some dam
age, resolved to prevent it by seasonably shovelling
it off. He therefore ascended it, having first, for
fear the snow might all slide off at once, and him
self with it, fastened to his waist one end of a rope,
and giving the other to his wife, he went to work :
but fearing still for his safety,4 my dear,’ said he,
‘tie the rope round your waist;’ no sooner had she
done this, than off went the snow, poor minister and
all; up went his wife: Thus on one side of the
barn, the astounded and confounded clergyman
hung, but on the other side hung his wife, high and
dry, in majesty sublime, dangling at the other end
of the rope. At that moment, however, a gentle
man luckily passing by, delivered them from their
perilous situation.
American Locomotives.—At a meeting of the
Civil Engineers’ Institution in London, some time
since, the subject of American locomotive steam en
gines was discussed. It was stated that the superi
ority of the American locomotives was incontestible.
—In a trial on an inclined plane, an American
“Bogie” engine, with a cylinder of 12$ inches in
diameter, driving wheels 4 feet diameter, weighing
14 tons, conveyed a gross load of 54 tons up the in
cline at the rate of 12 miles an hour ; while the
best of the English engines, with a 13 inch cylinder,
5 feet driving wheels, and weighing 12 tons, drew
38 tons up the incline at the rate of six miles an
hour. It was stated that the American engines
consumed a greater amount of fuel than the En
glish. &
m K
Interesting Incident.'—A Carrier Pigeon a
lighted at the House of the Hon. Wm. M. Burrall
in Canaan, on Monday afternoon, giving signs of
hunger and fatigue. As Judge B. never sends the
traveller empty away, he brought out some wheat to
his winged visiter, which it very greedily ate from
his hand. While the pigeon was eating, its legs
were noticed to be wrapt with paper; and on remov
ing the bandages they were found to contain Mr.
Webster’s speech, delivered on Saturday, at the
Bunker Hill celebration, written in two sheets of
tissue paper. The Judge had the pleasure of read
ing the speech while the bird was satisfying its
| hunger and regaining its strength, and then repla.
cing the tissue boots on the faithful airy messenger,
it took a rapid flight to the West, and soon, we trust,
found its way to the owner.—Litchfield Enquirer.
[ Dreadful Storm—Destruction of the Mil
ler Tent.—One of the heaviest storms we remem
ber to have seen, occurred this day about 11 o’clock,
A. M. The rain poured down with a force and im
petuosity that babies description, and seemed one
dense mass of water dashing from the heavens to
the earth.
The imposing tent erected by the Millerites has
suffered from its effects. The Rev. Mr. Hines was
engaged in exhortation to not less than 500 persons,
when the force of the wind and rain broke some of
the fasts, and a scene of indescribable confusion en
sued. The ladies, about 70-in number, were seated
without bonnets when the ropes gave way, and bon
nets, ladies, children, men, water, mud", and wind
were mixed up in most fearful confusion. Luckily
we hear there was no serious accident, though some
of the ladies are severely bruised.—Roch. Post.
An Exciting Scene.—One of the Mier prison
ers who escaped and is in New Orleans, has rela
ted to the editor the Picayune the particulars of
their suffering. The time of drawing the lots ^
which was an act of life or death, was one of the i
most anxious solicitude. One hundred and four
white beans and seventeen black were deposited
in a hat—the prisoners were marched up to draw,
every two handcuffed together—the poor fellow'
whose evil fate it was to draw a black bean was
then separated from his comrade, on whom he was
never to look again—he was put into a high walled
yard, and in four hours afterwards a volley of delib
erately aimed Mexican musketry separated his
mortal soul from his suffering body! Base was this
victory of cowardly vengeance.
The Law Exempts Clergymen from Bridge
and Ferry Tolls.—We were asked, some time
ago, by a Reverend friend of the Methodist de
nomination, (says the Editor of the Mercury) wheth
er the I,aw exempts Clergymen from Bridge and
Ferry tolls? Unable to answer the inquiry with
certainty at the moment, we have been at pains since j
to inform ourselves, and vouch for the#iccuracy of
the following Law, found at page 468, vol. 9, Stat.
at large : ^
“ And be it enacted by the authority aforesaid: That
the members of both branches of the Legislature,
coming to or returning from the Legislature ;—all \
Ministers of the Gospel,—and all other persons going
to attend or returning from divine service, on the
Sabbath-day ; all persons necessarily attending on
Patrol or Militia duty, be, and they are hereby ex
empted from paying any ferriage, toll or duty for
passing and repassing auy of the ferries or bridges
established by Law.”—Charleston Mercury.
Cost of an “experiment.”—The Army and
Navy Chronicle, referring to the recent experiments
on the smoke pipes of the Steam Frigate Missouri,
says—“ We have not been able to ascertain the
exact cost to the Navy of this piece of folly ; but
we have reason to believe that it has already been
something like $10,000, exclusive of the pay of
officers and crew, the expenses of the vessel and
loss to the service of keeping the crew and ship out
of employment while the alterations were going on.
If we add the expense of unexperimenting, that is,
of tearing down the costly alterations, and putting
the old fixtures back in their places, and the pay of
the officers and men who are kept idle in the mean
time, wailing for their ship, we shall find that the
Navy has been put to the expense of some $i’0,00()
or more.”
Important to Travellers.—By a recent dec i
sion of tlie Court of Errors of this State, the long
mooted question has been settled whether the
steamboat and railroad proprietors are answerable
for goods put on board either conveyances. The
decision alluded to was given in the case of Tobey
vs. Vanderbilt, and thereby the doctrine of the com
mon law was affirmed. The following are the points
decided:—
1. That all common carriers are responsible for
goods put on board of vessels or conveyances, with
out reference or respect to any notice that they may
give that they will not be held thus responsible.
2. That a notice on the part of the owners of any
steamboat or conveyance that they will not be
accountable unless a receipt is taken does not ex
onerate them from responsibility—N. Y. Herald.
Dispatch.—On the 1st day of February, a new
pattern of Mousseline de Laine, arrived at New
York, and were offered by the importer at 14 cents
per yard by the case. The agent of a Rhode Is
land calico printingestablishment forwarded a piece
of the new style of goods to Providence the day
after their arrival, and in 10 days he had the same
style of goods and of equal fabric in New-York,
selling at ten cents per yard. The manufacturer
had but 12 days to engrave the new pattern on a
copper cylinder from which the engraving was rais
ed on a steel cylinder, then hardened ana ready for
impression; the compound of ingredients for color
discovered by chemical experiments,—the cloth
printed, dried and cased for market.
Astronomical Apparatus.—We are happy to
learn that the amount of 825,000, which was a short
time since proposed to be raised in this city for the
purchase of a telescope and other astronomical in
struments, is all subscribed. Of the above sum $5000
were subscribed by one gentleman, $1000 by ano
ther, several sums of $500 by other individuals,
$3000 by the American Academy of Arts and Sci
ences, and $1000 by the Society for the Diffusion
of Useful Knowledge. A considerable length of time
will doubtless elapse, before the principal Tele
scope can be manufactured, but measures we doubt
not will be immediately taken for havipg it in pro
gress without delay.—Bost. Dai. Adv.
i-KuuuuT from manures—Experiments m uer
many have led to the following conclusions;
If a given quantity of land, without any manure
yields three times the seed employed, then the same
quantity of land will produce—
Five times the quantity sown, when manured with
old herbage, putrid grass, or leaves, graded stuffs,
&c.
Seven times when manured with cow dung.
Nine times with pigeon’s dung.
Ten times with horse dung.
Twelve times with goat’s and sheep’s dung.
Fourteen times with human manure or bullock’s
blood.
Lead Pipe.—Professor Hare of the University
of Pennsylvania, has quieted the fears of people in
relation to the deleterious quality of the Croton
water, when introduced into houses by means of
leaden pipes. He says, having used the Schuylkill
water, so conveyed to my laboratory in the Univer
sity, for more than twenty-five years, I have never
perceived the slightest indication of the presence of
that metal. Had there been any lead in the liquid
in question, the reagents which I have been accus
tomed to use, must have rendered the impurity evi
dent
Cure for Hydrophobia.—'We learn from the
Schoharie Patriot that a mad dog recently bit seve
ral individuals in that vicinity, and some of them,
soon after, evidenced symptoms of the disease.
Filed copper was speedily administered—about one
third of a dose givenat intermissions of eight hours.
This has been repeated from time to time. The
dog bit several brutes and a cow, a hog and three
dogs have died of the disease. The remedy—cop
per alone—has proved a complete antidote in other
cases of this terrible disease.
Oregon Convention.—The Oregon General
Committee of Ohio, have given notice that a con
vention will be held at Cincinnati, on the fourth
and fifth of July next, to urge upon Congress the
immediate occupation of the Oregon Territory, by
the arms and laws of the republic, and to adopt such
measures as may seem most conducive to its imme
diate and effectual occupation, whether the govern
ment acts or not in the matter.
Wire Rope.—A paper was recently read before
the Liverpool Society of Arts, by A. Smith, in which
it was stated that the results of a careful experiment
showed that standing rigging of wire rope, of equal
strength with the hempen rope, one third of its size,
and half the weight, may be fitted at about two
thirds of the cost—Sheet Anchor.
