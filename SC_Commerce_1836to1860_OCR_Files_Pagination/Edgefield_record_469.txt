gay and blithe as the lark, and the brothers
andsisters at her father's fireside cherish

sie left all to join her destiny with yours;
to make your home happy, and to do all
that woman's love could lirompt, and wo
man's. ingennity devise, to mieet your wish
es and to lighten the burdens which might
press upon you imt your pilgrimage. She,
ofcourse, had her expectations too. She
could not entertain feelings which pronis
ed so tmucht withotit irrming some idea of
reciprocation on your part, and she did ex
pect yut wotild after marriage perform
those kind olices of whicb yott were so Ia

Why did she leave the bright hearth of
her youthful days? Wihy did you ask her
to give up tie enjoyments of a happy
home? Was it simply to darn your stock

Was it simply to condttce to your owrr

what would ie the effect of sucha a mod1
of electioneering: it was it direct bribe t

time pork merchants at Cincinnatti, Ohili
were contraciing with fie farimers on ilti
principle: they cottracted to give otte cetn
