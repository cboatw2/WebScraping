jgft NORTH EASTERN BOUNDARY QUESThe
Madisonian. the olhViol onnn of the flora
vernment, has the Ibllowin S ?* ! tcr!o:
' i" The North Eas'c*n ?I fnvinrr noticed
the varjous and widely dillcrciii statements-in
Bks."" other journals in rctrard t" :1m X rt h Eastern
Br Boundary negotiation, wo believe it to be as well
A "t0 ?lve our vers'on* w"h;r!j, perhaps is as likely
to be correct, as the rest, ) > say the least.
That the matter is settled ail admit.
* * The line, as we understand, is from the monument
North to the .St. Julius?nbmtr the middle
of the St. Johns to liio inouiii 01 uie c-.i. crancis;
up the middle of the St. Franristo Lake Pnlicnagram'toh;
thence-Southwesterly sirvght to 1I10
, JVorthwestermost head of Cornier' i'-nt river.?
The portion of the M iddawaskn settlement South
t of the St. Johns, to belong to Maine.
By this it will he seen that by lar the Inrgo??
Iiortion of the territory and all the land of iho
^ east value agriculturally is retained by Maine.
Great;Ejritain lias a strip over which she can
^ pass fro'ro Fredorickton to Quebec, and, if we
w are not misinformed by tlioso who have opportunities
of knowing all, that this strip is, or can
be made good for, is to pass over, and t hat as
speedily as possible, unless one wishes to starve
from cold qr hunger.
For this right of way, we are lo rcrcivc the
free navigation of the Sr. Johns, from its source
its mouth and Rouse's Point, an unquestioned j
^jj&rtion of British territory and a valuable military
jMsition. For parting with that portion of the j
territory, Maine and Massachusetts are to re- ]
ceive a smal^sum of rtioney [contrary to our in-1
g formation a few days since] from the U.S. quite j
|? as much to be sure as it is worth, and not onequarter
of what Gen. Jackson proposed to pay i
Maine alone, or loan her, as the Globe calls it. j
? ?- > A pretty loan to be sure; the land to he surveyed j
jjjjp and to lie sold by Uncle Sam, lie paying all ex-[
* flenses and. the gross amount of the sales of
twelve hundred and fifty thousand of acres to be .
paid over to Alamo, winioui uctiuciiun.
This is what we understand lias been agreed '
upon, as regards the disputed North-eastern
. Boundary question. We do not pretend to be
a exact or minute, but we have good reason to be3?
lieve that we arc, in the main, correct in our dc^
scription of tlie line. As to other matters, the
t settlement of which is not yet made known, we
wait with confidence and patience the result.,
I That the President or the Secretary will pro.
pose or agree to any thing that the Senate, or any
t-* reasonable and honest man can find plausible
? ground for objecting to, we do not for a moment
believe; nor indeed, can we give credit for sincerity
to those of either faction, who are so impatient
to condemn before they know, and who
seem resolved to find fault beforehand, with what
ever the administration may do, lest they should
have no chance after its arrangements arc declared,
to indulge their bad passions in abuse
and vituperation.
The matter all settled ron Federalism,
where and as it should be.?The London
News, in an elaborate editorial notice of the U.
S. makes the following disposition of the Presidency
for the next term:
"Henry Clay of Kentucky will, undoubtedly,
be brought forward as a candidate for the Presii?-vdency;
and if any man in the country have i??i i
claims upon his fellow-citizens for the first otlice i
~ In their gift he is thartnavi. Mr. CUy hac filled j
"\A every office below those of President and Vice j
> President, with pre-eminent ability, and with tin- j
questioned integrity?in the most satisfactory j
and beneficial manner to his country, and with
the greatest honor and the truest lame to himself.
General Winfield Scott, the commander-in-chief
of the Amorican army, will be placed in nomination
for the Vice Presidency by the same party [
which will support Mr. Clay for President, (ion.
Scott is as advantageously known as a gentleman,
a scholar, and an enlightened and patriotic I
citizen, as he is for being a skillful, judicious and !
gillant soldier. The people of the U. S. would 1
do themselves honor and service by the election
of VIr. Chv and Gen. Scott to the two highest
offices in the Government."
"Daniel Webster, tiie present aide Secretary
of State, will not, in ail probability, be a candidate
at the next election. His talents and his
services have rendered him the idol of his own
part of the country?the New England States:
but strong sectional feelings, arising from local
ciuses, which will, it may be hoped, subside in a
few more years, would, at present, shut hiui out
from the remotest chance of success.
Thieves Killed.?A notorious horse and negro
thief named Met calf was recently shut at
Fort Jesup. It was ascertained that he had a
house on the Toro which was the rendezvous of
a gang of robbers, and that another notorious
character, named James Strickland, alias "Tiger
Jim," was there. A party consisting of some
citizens and a few dragoons from Fort Jesup,
immediately proceeded to the place, waited in
ambush during the night, and seeing Strickland
in the morning, ordered him to yield. lie attjmptgdto
getaway, but was instantly shot.?
The rouse was filled with arms. A slave stolen
last August was found a short distance from the
house.
"Thus says the Natchitoches Reporter, "two
of the most hardened wretches on the frontier
^ have met their deserts at last. 'Tiger Jim' last
eumrner was one of those who perpetrated so
many atrocities in Shelby and Harrison counties,
Texas.? lie then barely escaped with his life,
having been shot at and wounded. Finding Tex?"??
as too hot for him, lie came back to his old haunts
^ on this side of the Sabine. It is to be hoped

ol' that country to tiic brink of starvation an

| ol July-lib, brought by the Acadia.
Ball. Republican.
"Evidence of the appaling extent and di?or
gnni/.ing tendency of distress, among the labor
j nig population of the country, accumulates witl
) a rapidity which defies all our attempts to des
j cribe it in detail. The conviction is forced upoi
| our inind-i that we are on the eve of a disrup
j lion of the social ties, unless immediate and ef
fectual relief be brought to the suffering multi
j tuiles who fill the streets and highways of all th<
thickly populated portions of that land. Tin
' accounts which reach us by every post, conc.u
in depicting the victims of compulsory idleness
and starvation according to law, as becoming
more and more fierce in their demeanor, more
and more reckless in their conduct, and more
and more threatening in their language. That
hunger, which breaks through stone walls, anc
braves death in pursuit of the means of life, if
doing its work among our population with t
ha<1e that should arrest the solemn attention ol
all who dread the consequences of an ignition
of the combustible masses of society.
We havejust learnt lroin a respectable informant,
who came up from Hull to London in the
steamer Water Witch on Saturday, that there
was 22 recruits on board?eleven or twelve from
Leeds, and the rest from .Sheffield. In the
course of conversation with one of them, he
stated, that during fourteen days he had been
obliged to subsist on half a penny roll a day.?
All these declared that their sole motive for en
listing was tlie want of tlio necessaries of life,
ami that it was at last a choice between death
and the profession of arms. Our informant, who
is a member of the select vestry, belonging to
tlie township of ilolbeck (Leeds,) says: "Every
day women with families apply for relief, whose
husbands have enlisted or emigrated to escape
starvation; and that, many mechanics in Leeds,
who eighteen months ago were earning twentyfour
shillings per week, are now working in the
same shops, ami the same' length of time, for
fifteen shillings per week. And yet the Prime
.Minister tells us that he will resolutely oppose
that measure which alone promises employment
and the means of honest subsistence to the people
of this country!
What a spectacle does this Island present!
Though no awful visitation has befallen us in
the shape of invasion, or civil war, or pestilence,
or blight, or earthquake; and though, as a nation,
our power at once of production, consumption,
and the carrying out of an extensive and
honorable commerce, is unrivalled, we arc in a
condition, with regard to the most truly deserving
portions of the people, which might command
the pity of the untutored savage. This
cannot last. On the ministry, a,,j ilwii majorities
in the two houses, rests the responsibility
of those consequences which are now apprehended,
with trembling anxiety, by all who arc
not blinded bv selfishness and the love of party
It is the spirit of monopoly which has brought
us to the verge of ruin. It is the spirit of lrcc
commercial intercourse that must inspire agan
the drooping, and almost extinct energies o
our country."

1 THE MILL BOY OF THE SLASHES."
This is the title bestowed by the Federal isi
i upon t heir new idol, Henry Clay. If that be an
j great recommendation, (and we are free to adm
! its full weight,) we hope to reach the Presidet
I cy our sc. If at no very distant day, seeing that u
| had once the honor of being a "mill boy!"j
What say you fellow Democrats of the Unite
Slates, suppose you run the "mill boy" of 11
mountains against the "mill boy of the slashes!
The race is said not to be always to the swii
but nevertheless, we are willing to take a fa
, run for it with our illustrious coternparary of tl
\ "slashes." We propose to meet him any whet
' j between this and the limits of "Old Kcntuck,
i and to test our qualifications by a match goii
! to mill race. If our most magnanimous compel
tor beat us, we will most cheerfully admit It
superior qualifications; and if we beat him v
shall expect him to surrender all pretension
and suffer us to walk over the course without
' competitor.
' We submit our proposition, with all gravity,
our neighbor of the Lynchburg Virginian, wh
' we see, talks so largely about the "mill boy of tl
slashes." Our neighbor, as we heard and b
licve, is, baring his politics, one of the best fe
1 lows in the world, and withal, as honest as
r Whig editor well can he. From bis love of

r- The Webster's Treaty is likely to be the m<

,ie RAIL ROAD MEETING. '
I Saturday next, it will be remembered, a meet- J
s., ing is called for the purpose of considering the (
;e propriety of extending the Rail Road from Gads- t
's den to this place. We hope the meeting will be
~ well attended, and that all will come, with a de
ij termination to do something for the good of Cam- '
ig den. In 1833, a correspondent of this paper v
1S predicted that if the Rail Road was carried to ^
: Columbia, Camden would be ruined, unless the! ^
G, i I 1
ie road was brought here also. The Columbia road 1
hi has been completed, and is in successful opera- "
e tion, and we shall now see whether our people *
? I will permit liieir interests to suffer, or whether ^
it: they will come forward with one mind, and puti
i. forth all their energies in the enterprise,
d i In urging our citizens to action in this matter,' ^
0 we cannot use more appropriate or forcible lan-;
i- guage than that used by the correspondent alluI
ded to. lie says:?
d j "We know our duty; and cannot mistake our
interest. If we pursuejtjge one, or follow the
other, our course is plaih.'* In this matter indeed ' ti
!- we have no alternative. Our rise or fall now tl

'* that we must be ruined. Nothing can save us- v
n Trade will be diver'ed from us, and capital musti p

- j "To prevent this, is alike our duty and our e
"interest It can be done. We can doit. We o
^ | have only to act decidedly on this subject, to tl
i. show our zeal, energy, and enterprize?and all fi
II will yet be well with us. e
s i "We are favored by circumstances. The a
g trade of Columbia must go to Charleston. It has o
! no other outlet Not so with regard to Camden1
All that country which is north of us, may find, i:
'* and often does find, other markets, than those of i
y Camden and Charleston. v
t. j "The Charleston capitalists, therefore, who ii
)- are desirous of witnessing the prosperity of that e
c" city, would of course prefer securing a large d
jf amount of trade which is uncertain. By extend- h
r- ing the rail road to this place, this object would k
be efi'ected. For, from the facilities which s
would be thu>afiforded, a large and important o
portion of North Carolina business must come to v
I ,
10 this place and Charleston. I
a "We trust then that our good citizens will /
r" rouse themselves on this subject Our very de- p
^ pression should give them a newer and a fresher 6
ie energy. No people can assume a nobler stand e
id than those who determine to rise superior to ev- f,
*" ery mislortune. None are more degraded than
jg those who sink under its weight. Ixit us then
it act firmly, decidedly, and by union, we may re- r
is gain the loss of the past, and ensure to our town '
1 a palmy prosperity. J
"Of one tin ng we are certain. Let a branch of t
ij. the rail road extend, to Camden-, and it must be- '
e cmne a prosperous town. Will its citizens then
remain indifferent; or refrain from publicly pro- t
^ claiming their opinions on this subject? We 3

You are mistaken too, Mr. Mercury. John
Smith lives but a few doors from us. He never
vas a bachelor, and hopes never to be a widower;
le has been married several years instead of a
ew weeks. He is as clever a fefiow as ever
ived, and one of our most particular friends. He .

district Temperance Society, and makes better ?
Carriages than any body else in the State. c...

cers for the ensuing year. They then-a^olim- '
d to meet on Thursday the 28th, when" it was
nnounced that their Committee had prevailed
n Dr. W. H. Dinkins to address the meetingAt
an early hour, a large audience assembled
n the court house, and it gave us infinite pleasire
to witness the presence of an array of beauty^
vhich was calculated to awaken a much deeper ^
nterest, than the Doctor could hope to rouse^ v

audly applauded. - As for ourselves we scarcely ?_
now which to congratulate him most for-^|p \Wt,
miles and gratulations of so brilliant a circle^.
