Dear Brother,—I hereby send you my report for
the second and third quarters. Twenty-five have
been taken into the church on.trial, one expelled.
The number of children receiving catechetical
instruction, is about one hundred, sometimes more
and sometimes less. The mission, for the most
part, is in a prosperous condition. The missionary
is kindly received, and well treated by the proprie
tors of the slaves, and his labours are properly ap
preciated by them. The slaves consider it a great
blessing to have the missionary among them, and a
gracious privilege, to wait upon the ministrations of
the word of life. The congregations are large and
orderly; and it is enough to fill the heart of a
Christian, and especially of a Christian minister,
to see with what eagerness they listen to, and re
ceive the gospel of Jesus Christ; for they really
seem to say, " we are not ashamed of the gospel of
Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to
every one that believeth.” And admitting the
fact, that many among them are irreligious and
wicked, and that there may be some hypocritical,
pretending to serve God with their lips, while their
hearts are far from him, yet, there are many reli
giously devoted to Gad, striving to make their cal
ling and election sure, and their lives exhibit to
the world, that they are what they profess to be,—
Christians. I shall be very much mistaken, if, on
that day when the saints are collecting from North
and South, East and West, many of these people
do not arise from this Southern clime to live with
God, and praise him forever. I conclude this
report, by asking an interest in your prayers.
Yours affectionately,
J. W. Farmer.

Missions in the Indian district of the Missouri
Conference. .
Shawnee Mission.—L. B. Stateler, Missionary.
The Shawneas are situated west of the state of
Missouri, immediately on the boundary line, and
have a population of about one thousand souls.
Their condition has been much improved within
the last few years, and is Btill improving. Our
mission among this people is reported to be in a
prosperous state. The number of church mem*
bars, as returned at the last Conference, is one
hundred and sixty-three. The prospect for the
future is said to be quite encouraging.
Delaware Mission.—Edward T. Peery and
John T. Peery, Missionaries.
The Delaware people are situated immediately
north of the Shawnees, and separated from them
by the Kansas River. We learn from one of
the missionaries, that this mission is in a healthy
and improving condition. It has now a membership
of one hundred and twelve. There are in the mis
sion two native local preachers, and several exhort
ers. The meetings are well attended, and appear
ances very promising.
Wyandott Mission.—Jas. Wheeler, Missionary.
The Wyandots have, during the past year, emi
grated from Ohio to their new home in the west.
They have purchased a small tract of land from
the Delawares, situated in the point immediately
above the junction of the Missouri and Kansas
Rivers. They have a population of about seven
hundred. Of this number, about two hundred and
fifty are members of the church. Among these are
one local preacher, and three exhorters. At our
latest advices, the missionary, who was transferred
from the Ohio Conference, had not yet arrived.
They were, however, partially supplied from the
Delaware Mission.
A great part of the religious community among
the Wyandots are respectable, industrious, perse
vering, and economical. Indeed, they may be con
sidered as civilized. Some of them have adopted
the English language in their families. We are ■
glad to learn that they have suffered less in their j
religious interests, by their removal, than could
have been expected. It is confidently hoped that
their influence and example will be decidedly bene
ficial among their new neighbors.
Kicxapoo Mission.—Nathl. M. Talbott, Missionary.
The Kickapoos are situated near Fort Leaven
worth, adjoining the Delawares on the north-west.
The number of church members in this mission,
according to our latest report, is fifty. The whole
population of this tribe is set down at six hundred.
By a letter from the superintendent of the Indian
district, dated February 28th, 1844, we learn that
this mission is in a good condition, and that at the
time of his last visit among them, eight were added
to the society, of whom two were a chief and his
son.
Peobia Mission.—Nathan T. Shaler, Missionary,
This mission lies some forty miles south of the
ShawneeB, and embraces several fragments of
tribes now nearly extinct. The reported number
of members in society is forty-five. Though our
beloved missionary is faithful and laborious, this
mission cannot be said to be very prosperous.
This is owing principally to the rapid decline of the
Indians. Yet, even here, our labours have doubt
less been the means of saving many precious souls.
In their rapid strides toward extinction, as nations,
many of them have looked upon the Saviour as “ lif.
ted up" by our missionaries, and obtained spiritual
life; and ultimately, from the bosom of the church
militant, they have gone rejoicingly home to the
church triumphant.
Potawattomik Mission--—Thomax B. Ruble,
Mitiionary.
This mission is situated eight miles south of
Peorii. Tb* present missionary rtc#lV$4 "ife
pointment to this station at the last Missouri Con
ference. He is prosecuting his work with diligence
and success. There are connected with the mission
thirty church members, twenty-five of whom have
been gathered in during the present Conference
year. The prospect of-more glorious results fn
this station is evidently increasing.
Indian Manual Labour School.—.Jerome C.
Berryman, Superindent. ; ,s
This institution is located in the Shawnee nation,
and is reported to be in a very prosperous condition.
The farm, which consists of five hundred acres, is
cultivated, in part, by the Indian boys; their time
being divided between their studies and manual la*,
bour. The girls also are employed part of their
time in spinning, weaving, sewing, knitting, &c.
The children are collected from the Shawnee, Del
aware, Kickapoo, Potawattomine, Peoria, Weaw,
Munsee, Kansas, and other Indian nations. The
present number of pupils in the school is sixty-six
boys, and forty-two girls. These also compose the
sabbath school. There -are three male teachers,
viz.:—A. C. Farnham, B. Kramer, and Wm. Ho
neywell. Mrs. Stateler, the wife of one of our
missionaries, is the matron; having charge of the
girls. The number of members in Society is fifty
four Indians, and sixteen whites. This institution
is received favourably by the tribes among which it
is located; and is viewed by them as a standing
evidence of the good feelings of the white man to
wards them. And one of the missionaries re
marks—" We ourselves view it as involving our
ultimate success among the Indians."
>In concluding our report of this mission district,
it is proper to add, that the schools at the diffbrent,
stations have been transferred to this institution.

THE KENTUCKY CONFERENCE.
The Kentucky Conference being a “ border”
Conference, great anticipations were entertain
ed, in various quarters, that a fatal difference of
opinion would prevail in its councils at this great
emergency. Indeed, it was confidently predicted
that the conference would go against a division
of the Church altogether; and energetic mea
sures were plied, sub rosd, to create dissention.
Much to the surprize of some persons, however,
an entire unity of action, bating one dissenting
voice, marked their course. The resolutions
adopted, while they are so mild and pacific as
to forestall the least complaint of excitement on
the part of the Northern press, are, at the same
time so firm and unyielding, as to produce con
viction, we should think, upon the part of the
most skeptical, that the South is in earnest, and
that a separation is unavoidable. They approve
the course of all their delegates in the General
Conference; condemn the action of the majority
of the General Conference in the case of Bishop
Andrew,and Harding; deem the contemplated
division inevitable, unless reparation be made
for past injury, and effectual security given for
the future protection of the disciplinary rights of
ministers and members; and take the position
that the contemplated division shall not be re
garded as a schism or secession from the M. E.
Church, but the origination of a separate juris
diction for a co-ordinate branch of the M. E.
Church in the United States of America. They
moreover make the very necessary distinction
between a Conventional Conference, and a con
stitutionally appointed General Conference, and
provide for the holding of the latter so soon as
the former shall have agreed upon the action
necessary to the crisis. These will be the great
principles embodied in the official action of all
the Southern Conferences, at their approaching
sessions, we doubt not. We look forward with
confident anticipation to a perfectly harmonious
concert of action at the approaching Convention
in Louisville, and to the most cordial union of
affectionate regards on the part of the conferen
ces there represented.
THE LAST SHIFT.
The vindictive and scurrilous attack on Dr.
Capers, in the editorial columns of the Chris
tian Advocate and Journal of the 9th instant, is
beneath the notice of all decent, not to say Chris
tian men. It is a melancholy exhibition of ha
treds which have been festering for some time,
of vindictiveness such as old men very seldom
feel. In coarseness, it exceeds any thing which
we have ever seen from the pen of Dr. Bond.
There is but a single point in the whole diatribe
which requires any comment from us; and this,
we feel called on, in the absence of Dr. Capers,
to bring to the attention of our readers. Dr.
Bond charges Dr. Capers with carrying on ne
gociations with the Hon. the Secretary of State,
for the joint purpose of effecting a dissolution of
the United States, and of the Methodist Epis
copal Church. He represents Dr. Capers as
having resorted to Mr. Calhoun for counsel, and
as exhorting the Methodists of the South to obey j
the “dictation” of that eminent statesman.
Now we take the liberty to pronounce the j
foregoing charge an utter falsehood ; a calumny
destitute of proof, foundation, or probability. Dr.
Capers has had no personal interview with the
Secretary of State, on any subject whatever, ei
ther at or since the General Conference. No
negociations of any kind have been carried on
between the parties ; no advice has been asked,!
no dictation volunteered; no such plot as that
announced by Dr. Bond has had any existence,
save in the disordered imaginings of a mind
i which must be verging on insanity. If the ri
diculousness of the calumny is not A sufficient
refutation, we give the whole story an unquali
fied and positive dental. - *
A QUESTION IN casuistry; ^
Ought the money of slaVeholdera to be received
by the Free Church of Scotland, was a delicate
question agitated at a Glasgow meeting some
month or two since. Dr. Burner one of the depu
tation of the Free -Church to the United Statea,
made a long apeech on the occasion. He seemed
to think that all American money waa leaaor more
"tinged with blood;’’ and recommended Great
JBritain to read this country a lesson, by showing
that through English commerce with other parts of
the. world, I hey could get their cotton without
her. He referred to his visit to the Baltimore
Conference during its last session, in the follow
ing terms :—“ And then I must apeak a word for
my friends of the. Methodist persuasion, from the
bishops connected with which we received the
greatest possible kindness. Mr. Lewis and I were
called to address the conference and to preach be
fore it. Though of course we were not entitled
to enter on the question of slavery there, we
made no secret of our views in our communings
with them in committees, and in our private inter
course with them. That body of Christians have
passed, by a respectable majority, an important re
solution, binding themselves to great principles,
decidedly anti-slavery ; and I believe a division, or
as we are accustomed to call it in Scotland, in.
the Free Church anqals, a disruption, is likely to
take place in the body, (cheers.) I think you
cannot do better than to open a correspondence
with all the religious bodies that are now coming
forward to fight the battle on the American soil.”
(Cheers.) Another speaker maintained that
every farthing of money that could be conceived
to be tainted with slavery, ought to be cast back
by the Free Church. Professor Wright from
America, affirmed that he could not believe that
the Free Church of Scotland would at last accept
money derived from slaveholders. The important
question, it appears, is left to the decision of a
committee. If the money is “ cast back,” the
eyes of the Southern people may perchance be
opened at last; and they may hereafter save them
selves from similar insults.

THE ILLINOIS CONFERENCE.
The following resolutions were adopted at the
late session of this Conference, and requested to
be published in the papers of the General Con
ference.
Resolved, That we do not concur in the resolu
tion of the late General Conference to alter the
sixth restrictive rule in section 3d of first chapter
in book of Discipline. Ayes 38: noes 22.
Resolved, That we do not concur in, but strongly
deprecate and oppose, any sectional division of
or separation from, the M. E. Church, as contem
plated in the series of resolutions of the late Gen
eral Couference.
Resolved, That we advise the general Super
intendents (the other annual conferences con
curring) to call a General Conference, to meet
in-, on the first Monday in May 1846, to take
into consideration the present state of the Church,
to review the acts of the late General Conference,
and, if possible, to provide for the continued unity
and tranquillity of the M. E. Church.
Resolved, That each of the Bishops be furnished
with a copy of the foregoing resolutions, and be
requested to lay them before the several annual
conferences, at their next sessions.
Resolved, That should the Louisville Conven
tion, to be holden in May next, by the Southern
portion of the M. E. Church, determine to divide,
the South have their full share of the funds, provi
ded they do not alter the discipline in any material
point.
This latter resolution shows the existence of a
strong sense of justico on the part of the Indiana
Conference, their vote on the first resolution not
withstanding.
Their motion for the call of a General Confer,
ence, looks very much to us like the shutting of j
the stable door after the steed is out. The organ
ization of a co-ordinate branch of the Methodist E.
Church in the Southern States will have been com
pleted in 1845, and of what avail will be a General J
Conference in 18461 Even if the extra General j
Conference should be disposed to make reparation
for past injury, and to offer ample security as to the
disciplinary rights of our ministry and membership,
it would be all too late. The majority of the late
General Conference with Bishop Hedding at their
head, rejected the proposition of the bishops to
suspend their action for a year or two, until the
people could be consulted throughout the connec
tion. They must bide the consequences of their
rash act
For U>* Southern Ckrlauw Adrocatt.
THOUGHTS FOR THE TIMES.—No. 3.
Mr. Editor,—For myself I need no farther de
monstration that the majority have transcended
right, than is furnished in the feeble, absurd rea
sons they employ for their justification. A cause
just and fair can never be deficient in the materiel
for rational argument. In such a case, the reasons
lie upon the surface. They are visible and avail
able. There is no necessity for dogmatism or
subtlety, and least of all to substitute pertinacious
and unfounded assumptions for the plain deduc
tions of sober sense. Among the opponents of
the South' were men of age, experience, and of
the highest order of intellect; men of analysis,
skilled in the disputative art, and yet with all their
wealth of mind, their profundity of wisdom, and
their ingenuity of invention, they were not able
to muster other than the most flimsy constructive
arguments to sustain their position. There was a
uniformity, a sameness in their speeches, which
showed beyond all controversy, that the most, and
the best they could say was dependent for its effi
cacy upon reiteration and a pretension of confi
dence, and not upon intrinsic force. They were
literally chut up tothe humiliating necessity of
carrying out their disorganizing purpose in eilent
obetinacy, or of degrading their understanding by
the veriest sophistry that ever came to the help of
wrong. The'argument derived from “expedi
ency” has been exhibited in its nakedness so of
ton, that I need only remark the fact that the will
and wUhe* of a majority of the member* qf the M.
E. Church were sacrificed to a faction. A major
ity of delegates, perhaps of preachers, have erected
their prejudices into a standard by which to judge
the opinions of the laity, and for their own behoof
have actually outraged the feelings of a large ma
jority of the membership. Expedient l that the j
few should be gratified at the expense of the
many, and this without law, and against law!
That may be the logicof abolitionism, but ail the
D. p.’s who gave it their superscription, can never
make it common sense.
The destruction of the general superintendency
was another strong-hold. This, in a former num
ber, we showed to be a fallacy, because the prac
I lice of the church has affixed a meaning to the
term essentially different from that assumed in the
| objection. The whole absurdity of the reasoning
of the majority on this point, is apparent to any
man who can discriminate between a general su
perintendent, and the general superintendency. It
takes several incumbents of the episcopal office to
make the last. In our outspread church, no one
man can practically be the first. All the bishops
are general superintendents “ de jure," according
to the theory and spirit of our church government;
but not one of them is such “ de facto," as far as
their actual bodily presence in the Annual Confer
ences is concerned.
Hat the burden of complaint,—the argument in
every mouth,—the invincible objection was, the
“ extension of Ike evil of slavery,” if Bishop An
drew were not deposed. The idea is so farcical,
the doctrine such downright nonsense, that I
would not shed a drop of ink upon it, if it had not
been repeated by Dr. Bond aind his correspondents,
and is seemingly regarded as the last intrench
ment,—the very Gibraltar of their security. You
remember, Mr. Editor, with what lachrymose coun
tenances and deprecatory tones they besought the
South at the last General Conference, not to force
“ the great evil” upon them. “ Don’t brethren,
ohl don’t thrust this intolerable calamity upon us,
who are now free from it.’’ The impression seem
ed to be that if Bishop A. were allowed the rights
socured to him by the Constitution of the United
States, the State of Georgia, and the Discipline of
the M. E. Church, the consequence would be that
every abolitionist and anti-slavery man in the church
would become a slaveholder, involuntarily and ir
resistibly. If Bishop A’s. “connection with slavery”
were tolerated, a mighty revolution would ensue.
State laws and manumission deeds would be
abrogated ; the Baltimore Conference would lose
its conservative power; Liberia pour its re-en
thralled colonies upon New England’s hallowed
shores, and Durbin and Bond, Cass and Cartwright,
Finley and Spencer, become dealers in bones and
blood. Shocking! shocking! Our good bishop’s
“connection with slavery” was a mysterious af
fair. What fecundity of mischief! What necro
mantic power lurked in the chinks and crevices !
And how fortunate for Methodism, the negro
and the world, that there .were such lynx-eyed
watchmen on the walls of our Zion ! That “ one
eye” will be a precious relic in time for an aboli
tion museum. Nor ought we to find fault be-,
cause, to use a favorite figure of our facetious friend
from Illinois, men generally shut one eye when
they “ draw a bead.”
“ Extend the evil of slavery I” Mr. Editor, can
you understand the “ modus operandi” of this
thing 1 Would the bishop have been any more
a slaveholder by being tolerated, or is he any the
less so by being deposed 1 Would the recogni
tion of his rights have enslaved any freeman, or
multiplied slave-dealers ! Would the free states
have reconsidered their legislation 1 And if not
could members of the Methodist Church have
bought and held slaves under the discipline in op
position to civil law! Perhaps these brethren
meant that if they did not declare their sense of
the bishop’s conduct, Texas would be admitted
into the Union. I say perhaps, for I cannot
“draw ahead” fine enough to see the relation
between the two things. I had concluded that the
whole ado about “extension” was intended to
enure to the benefit of the Baltimore Conference.
Another Harding might arise to trouble Griffith,
Davis &. Co., if a slaveholding bishop were allow
ed. But Dr. Bond’s last editorial has explained
the matter to my satisfaction. Paul had eat meat
offered to idols and “the weak brethren” wise
likely to imitate his example, their consciences to
the contrary notwithstanding. I did suppose there
was some cabalistic meaning about the terms “ex
tension,” “evil,” “slavery,” very significant to
the initiated, though unintelligible at least to a
Southern man. I really did not know but that the
Bishop’s “ connection with slavery, though a sim
ple every day transaction with private members
among us, might after all, in his peculiar case, be
invested with some strange mesmeric power, the
results of which no Southern philosophy could de
termine. But the case is now plain and scriptural.
“ The weak brethren" might have been tempted,
the young and the widowed to marry ladies with
slaves, and the rest to enter the market as negro
traders. But the plague is stayed,—the episcopal
example is harmless. The brethren though
“weak" arc ingenious. With the help of the
Drs. they have arrested the contagion, though
they did not cure the patient. They deposed the
Bishop, and yet recognized him as a Bishop,—said
he ought not to work, and yet he might if he
would,—he should be supported if be did, and
provided for just as well if he did not. The prac
tice in this case reminds me of the Doctor who
was called in to see a patient suffering from chill
and fever. The man of physic prescribed very
promptly, and yet in the judgment of the friends
very singularly. They asked if the medicine he
was giving would cure the chill and fever. “Oh
no,” he replied, “ but it will throw the subject
into fits, and I am death upon fits" The brethren
throw the church into division to cure the evil of
slavery; But alas iftejr have nc> power to'klll divi- ]
sion. They are u death” Upon the discipline and j
union. On the last point 1 have been light almost
to trifling, but sincerely I do not think it merits a !
graver consideration. " \r
Since the adjournment of the Conference, Dr j
Bond and his correspondents have become tenderly
alive to union, and have awful apprehensions of
secession and schism. The word unity has been
invested with a sort of superstitious sanctity, and
the changes have been rung upon it for the purpose
of terrifying the refractory South into submission
to the arrogant and aggressive North. It is suffi
cient to say that it has been a popular and accred
ited doctrine among Methodists, that Methodism
wae a unit the world over. And how this universal
notion 1 . Is there but one ecclesiastical organiza
tion in the four quarters of the earth. '" Nay—there
is the British conference, and the Irish conference,,
and the Canada conference, and the General con»
ference in the United States of America, ail sepa
rate, distinct, In some things peculiar, and yet
Methodism it a unit. One in doctrine and disci
pline,—each division claiming*, the world as jtit
parish, and Mr. Wesley as its founder,—each in
corporating that element of power, itinerancy, into
its system, and each labouring harmoniously to
spread scriptural holiness over the earth. Circum
stantial distinctions do not destroy essential same
ness. Variety is compatible with unity. Physi
cally there are many members in one body,—eyes,
ears, hands, feet; and morally, “there it neither
Jew nor Greek,—there it neither bond nor free,—
there it neither male nor female, for we are all one
in Christ Jetut. There might be, and, if Christi
anity brought forth its proper fruits, there would
be, unity of spirit—community of essential princi
ples—fellowship of gospel privileges, if the annual
conferences were each independent, instead of
being federative. Modes of worship and forms of
government identically the same, are not even im
portant to unity. The spiritual church of Christ
has no visibility but holiness ; faith is the element
of unity, and love the bond of union. These are
confined to no party. Let the Northern brethren
wait till we have renounced the Bible and Christ,
aye, till we have changed onr name ; made a new
Discipline ; altered the terms of membership ;
congregationalized our societies, before they charge
us with schism. Let Dr. B. remember his lauda
tions of the Church of Scotland, for ite noble vindi
cation of the rights of conscience, and, then, put us
in the same category, and cease from his ill-omen
ed charges. We are defending Methodism in her
Discipline, and the South in her rights. Among us
wo have no societies, falsely called Methodist,_a
wheel within a wheel,—an imperium in imperio,—
to whose dicta the Church must bow. Here Meth
odism is free from ail entangling alliances, engaged
in her proper work, with none of that busy-body
ambition which makes her a foe to the country
and its constitution. A. C. sends out a foul slan
der, from the ambuscade of his initial security,
when he charges on the South the purpose of
forming a “ pro-slavery church.” This self-convic
ted spy, whose interminable letters from the South
we alt remember now, not only essays to be a dis
cerner of spirits, but even to reveal purposes before
“they are formed within.” Who made him an
expounder of Southern doctrine 1 He is a marvel,
lous proper man,—reading the hearts of men a thou,
sand miles distant,—chronicling the doings of the
conference at Louisville eight months before it
comes on, and printing the earth and the Heavens
all over,—with sunbeams for type. Won’t we
figure in characters of light 1 He has written a
prospectus for this new “ Boston notion,” but for
got to inform the world whether it was to be
monthly, hebdomadal, or daily.
The South intends to have a Southern Metho
dist Episcopal Church. She is not to be fright
ened by hard words misapplied, nor by apprehen
sions of pecuniary loss. Those Northern writers
have miscalculated who have been suggesting dif
ficulties in the terms of division, whether they in
tend, in good faith, to arrest our organization, or,
maliciously to tease us. The friends of division
are neither a faction nor a fraction ; but a whole
people,—not far from a majority of a million. Bish
ops, elders, deacons, licentiates, travelling and lo
cal, official and private members-white and black—
with ns, are of one mind. The case is settled.
Dr. B’s southern correspondents who write other
wise, are “ owls of the desert,” lone birds, that
speak not but in darkness.
The day of compromise is clean gone. D. C’s
fair proposition, and the suggestions of J. T. Bas.
kerville are all straws against the wind. Two
words in confirmation of this opinion. In the
Christian Advocate of Oct. 2nd, the very paper
containing Baskerville’s proposition, with the Dr’s,
comments all dripping with honey, there are the
resolutions of the meeting held at Cliazy, N. Y.;
Plattsburg district, Troy Conference, in which the
authors declare they “can have no fellowship for
any professed Christians who make it an essential
part of their creed, that slavery, as it exists in
America, is sanctioned by the Gospel; ” and
these good brethren further say, they cannot regret
that such should leave them.
W ell, now, ihe foregoing is our creed. We do
not believe that slavery, as it exists among us, is a
moral evil. We believe, the Gospel does tolerate
the institution, and prescribes and regulates its cor
relative duties. Can the North and the South
compromise then 1 I trow not. Again : it is pro
posed that the North shall give up what, in truth,
she never had, all control of the subject of slavery,
and, for this boon, the South shall consent to au
thenticate the judgment of the last General Con
ference, and give it practical operation forever,
that slavery is, and shall be, a disqualification for
the Episcopal office. Surrender the right to legis
late upon the general subject, (a right the Conference
never had,) and, yet, retain ecclesiastical control
in the particular case on which hangs the present
controversy. Wbat a fraternal arrangement that
would be ? “ Render to Cesar the things that i
are Cesar’s,” and, yet, confess, that Cesar, or the
Devil, had so bedaubed us with defilement, that
we were unfit to preside in an abolition conference,
or to put our hands on a decent anti-slavery head.

r,From Zion’* Herald and Journal.
Mr, Editor. While the subject of division is be
ing discussed, more or less, through the length and
breadth of the land, and all our General Confe.
rence papers keep their readers informed of the
true state of this momentous question, why is it that
we hear next to nothing through our esteemed
Herald, the “ Organ of New England Methodism,”
save now and then a few lines from the pen of the
Editor in opposition to division 1 Is it because the
Methodists of New England agree with him in
his opposition to division ? It cannot be ! I have
looked with increased anxiety, for some time past,
for some note of dissent from the Editor’s views,
from some of the delegates to the last General ,
Conference, or some prominent brethren, who are
known lobe in favor of the contemplated division,
but I have looked in vain. The Christian Advo
cate and Journal, the Western Christian Advocate,
oppose division, Bishop Waugh publicly gives it as “'
his opinion there will be no division,—but the most
singular of all is, that the organ of New England
| Methodism should, some how or other, all at once
j C0lne t0 lhe conclusion, not only that there will be %
no division, but to earnestly desire this may be the
case ! Now, I have no desire for controversy with
any man, but I trust I may be permitted to express
my views, and what I believe to be the views of
the Methodists in New England on this subject.
If the South takes the views of the Christian Ad- *
vocate and Journal and the Herald, as the views
of the Methodists of New England, I think they *
will be greatly deceived. f •
1. I believe that the Methodists in New Eng
land, as a body, desire a division of the church,
the line to run between the slaveholding and the
non-slaveholding states, so as to effect.ally separate
all slavery from the M. E. Church. This they de
sire, not for the sake of division or disunion, but
as a ready and effectual means of dissolving their
present connection with slavery.
2. They are wiiling that the South should have
their full proportion of all’ the property of the
church. Whatever opposition the proposed plat. *
of division has met with in this quarter, it has not '
grown out of any desire to deprive the South of
their part of the avails of the Book Concern, but •!
from some other objectionable features of that plan, V
which they would seem to oountenance by consent
ing to any part of said plan.
3. New England will never willingly consent
to any plan of union which will not effectually
separate all slavery from the Northern divison of the
church. We are not opposed to slavery.in the
episcopacy simply, but to all slavery, in the minis,
try and in the membership. We are not able *
even to “guess” how it can be right in one, but
wrong in the other, j ;
4. While we believe that a division of the
church is best, (all things considered,) and desire
that it may be brought about as peacefully as pos
sible, we can but deeply regret that Dr. Bond and*
several correspondents of the Christian Advocate,
and more than all, that the Editor of the Herald’,
should oppose it. Not that I fear that their opposi-’
tion will wholly prevent a division, but that many
slaveholders in the Northern part of the slave,
holding states will thereby be induced to come with
the North ; and thus, although divided, yet we shall
still have slavery in the M. E. Church, and conse
quently altercations, discord and warfare till one '■
of the contending parties shall yield to the wishes
of the other, or put an end to the contest by another
division !
These are my views, honestly entertained and
as frankly expressed. II my brethren differ with
me, let them say so. Let them speak out plainly
and kindly. The present state of things demands
it The South have a right to know our views •
our brethren in the slaveholding states who may
