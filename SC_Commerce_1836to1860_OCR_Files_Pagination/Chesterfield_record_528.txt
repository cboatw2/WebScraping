CULTIVATION OF COIN.
The difference of opinion among farmers
as to the best mode of cultivating
corn, induced me some years ago, to give
: some attention to the subject. The reasons
assigned, and the experience of many
of the best agriculturists, in favor of the
system of level cultivation have convinced
- me that our present mode is not the best,
* and that it is susceptible of a decided
change for the better.
I am perfectly aware, that to question
the propriety of the exclusive use of the
plough in the cultivation of corn will be
laughed, at, and that to intimate that the
ridging of a corn field is not the most cer.
tain mode of ensuring a good crop will be
denounced as mere M book farming " and
hence entitled to no respect
The preseot mode of cultivation is genorally,
to hern off the stalks and stubble
that may be upon the ground?to break
?p with a shallow furrow?plant the corn
without rolling or harrowing the ground
?then barrewing the corn while small,
and then by plougeing as often as may
he deemed necessary. In ploughing the
corn, the prevailing and almost universal
rafeia, to plough close to the coro hills.
** to cut the fibres of the roots so as to in,
crease and strengthen the stalks, as yov
cut the roots of trees in an orchard by
ploughing, to make the trees grow vigorouslp
! / /?to throw the earth high up on
the stalks, and to fay by the crop by
ploughing three or four furrows between
the rows, that the ground may be well
ridged, $o at to retain the moisture about
p the hills of com ! ! f
The system of culture, that I believe
is sustainable by reason and experience,
is the opposite of all this.
1.?If the ground intended to be culti.
rated in corn has a sod upon it, it should
be broken up in the fall or winter precee*
ding, if the weather is suitable; if not, it
should be ploughed in February, or at
least in the first week of March. If not
level it should be rolled, end if not mellow
it should be harrowed before planting,
^ 2.?If stubble or corn ground, no stub,
ble nor stalk* should he burned or removed
unless taken to the manure pile?should
be ploughed six inches deep, and if not
mellow should be harrowed.
3.?While small, the corn should he
harrowed and the ground should be afterwards
kept mellow and loose by the re.
peated use of the cultivator.
4.?On sod ground a plough should
ever be use<f in the cultivation of corn.
^ 5.?On other ground the plough should
never be used, after the roots have exten.
ded any distance from the hills, and at no
time unless indispensably necessary to
prevent the ground from baking.
6. The fibres or small roots of the corn
should not be cut; the cutting ofT every
fibre deprives the stalk of a part of its
nourishment.
? The earth should not be thrown
high up on the hills, as it induces the
throwing out of additional spur roots. A
very alight portion of mould may be put
round the hill.
8. The ground in the cultivation of
com should be kept as level as possible,
to permit the roots to extend in every di.
reetion and to retain moisture. Ridging,
- a a _ at a !
Clin cne root*?prevents me exwnnun
of the turftce of the root* beyond the
middle of the rows?drains the water
from the hills?exposes more surface to
the action of the sun, and is therefore injurious
to a crop in a dry season.
My own limited observation and experince,
satisfy me of tbe correctness of
the above rules to be observed, in the
cultivation of corn, and 1 now offer the
pinions of the ablest and most practical
farmers in the United States to sustain
the positions I have assumed.
Judge Buel, who for good sense?for a
A thorough knowledge of the science of
* agriculture?for general intelligence?
tinictical exDerience?and for a most ex
tensive knowledge end familiariiy with
the modes adopted by our agriculturists
was unequalled by any man in the Unitec
8tates, in speakiog of the cultivation ol
this crop, expresses the following opinions:
M The after culture consists in keeping
the soil loose and free from weeds, which
is ordinarily accomplished by two dress,
ings, and in thinning the plants, which
latter may be done the first boeing, 01
partially omitted till the last. The prac.
tice of ploughihg among corn, and ol
making large hills,-is justly getting into
disrepute ; for the plough bruises and cute
the reotsof the pleats, turas up the sod
and manure to waste, and renders the
crop more liable to suffer by dronght.
1 The ftst dressing should be performod as
' soon as the size of the plants will permit,
t and the best implement to precede the
hoe is a corn harrow, adapted to the width
1 of the rows, which every farmer can
1 make. This will destroy most of the
weeds and pulverize the soil. The seci
on<) hoeing should be performed before
or as soon as the tassels appear, and may
1 be proceeded by the corn harrow, or a
: shallow furrow of the plough, or what is
better than either, by the cultivator. A
slight|tarthing is b< neficiaf, prriVidtd the
earth is scraped from the surface, and the
sod and manure not exposed. It will be
found beneficial to run the harrow or cub
tivator a third, and even a fourth time be.
tween the rows, to destroy weeds and
loosen the surface, particularly if the sea.
son ts dry."
"Some entertain a mistaken notion,
that it is prejudicial to stir the soil among
corn in dry weather, and others, that
weeds serve to prevent the evaporation
~ mi _
of moisture by a not sun. 1 ne re rae
of these opinions is true. The exhaustion
of moisture by a plant is in the ratio of
the surface of its leaves and stalks presented
to the sun and air." .
"Indian coin.?There is no crop
which habit has rendered more inispensable
to the wants of our families and our
farms than this. The late John Taylor,
fcf Virginia, termed it our 1 meat, meal
and manure.' Holding this high rank in
our farm economy, it is a subject of moment
to adopt the best mode of culture.
As many districts are shy in producing
wheat, and as this crop is seriously threatened
by tbe new (to us) wheat insect, it
hecomes more a matter of solicitude to
render our corn crops productive. But
as this grain demands more labor in its
culture than other grain crops, so it i?
more important, on the score of profit
that it should be well managed ; for if
thirty bushels an acre be considered only
a remuneration for the labor bestowed on
the crop?all that the product falls short
of this must be a loss?and all that it ex.
ceeds, a nett gain on the cultivation
The first consideration in regard to the
com crop, is to give it a dry mellow soil;
he second, that this soil be rich, fat or
fertile; and the third, that the seed be
timely put in and the crop well taken
care of. Neither wet grounds, nor stiff
clays, nor poor grounds, will repay by
their product, the labor required on a crop
of corn. He who has no other but these,
should not attempt to raise it as a field
crop. He had better bestow his labor
upon other objects, and busy his corn.
We think the best prrparnHon for corn
is a clover ley, well clovered with long
manure from the harn.yard, well ploughed
and well harrowed. It is better to give
sixty loads of dung to three acres than to
ten, upon the ordinary lands in our neigh,
borhood. The difference in product will
not make up for the difference in labor.
Corn can hardly be dunged too high.
What we have to recommend, that is not
common in the culture of this crop, is,
that double the usual quantity of seed be
applied?the number of plants to be re.
duced at the weeding?i n order to insure
three or four stalks in each hill;?that
the roots be not broken, nor the manure
thrown to the surface by the plough, but
that the harrow and cultivator be substi.
tuted for, it which will sufficiently mel.
low the surfsce and destroy weeds, and
that the hills be but slightly earthed. By
ploughing and hilling we conceive the
manure is wasted, the roots broken and
bruised, and limited in their range for
food, the crop more exposed to injury
from drought, and the labor increased."
In speaking of the plough in the cul*
tivation of corn he again thus remarks?
44 We do not use it. We think its
USE preji'DICI al in breaking THE
boots and in limiting their RANGE
for nutriment."
Mr. James M. Sutton, of St. George
. Delaware, who raised upon seventy.nine
acres 8.284 bushels of rorn, and who
Rives an accurate and detailed account
of the condition and cultivation of each
field makes this remark in relation to the
use of the plough :
M In order to test the advantage of the
cultivator over the plough, for tilling
corn, he had five rows in his field that
he lapped the furrow to, with a plough,
previous to going over it the last time with
the cultivator. He soon discovered that
rrmwf h of these five rows fell short, in
( ,,,v h'" - .
height, of those adjacent, and yielded oneI
fifth less corn.
41 There is no douht but the true mode
of tillingcorn, especially where sod giound
is used is to plough deep, and use nothing
i> but the fallow and flake harrow for its
cultivation. By not disturbing the sod
ploughed down, it remains there as a re.
servoir of moisture, and an exhilarating
principle throughout the season, to the
j growth of the corn."
f j auks m. suttojf.
. Upon Mr. Sutton's report of his crop,
P Judge Buel adds the following :
J *?Note.?The management which led
to the extraordinary product of corn,
, should be deeply impressed upon the mind
, of every corn grower. 1. The ground
was well dunged with long manure; 2.
r ft was planted on a grass ley, with one
> deep ploughing; 3. It was well pclver.
, i izbd with the harrow; 4. the plough was
11 not u?e4 io the after culture, nor the c+rn
A
out fn Varch and April, consequently was
very little rotted. I spread it regularly and
ploughed it down with a large concave
plough, (niado br G. Cox, of Middletown,
Delaware.) sevpn inch** deep. I thes harrowed
it twice the same way it waa ploughed.
I then had the rows marked out with' a small
plough, three feet ten' inchee wide, and /?ne
and a half inches deep. I planted nay corn
from 18 to 22 inches apart, and covered it
with hoes; juet drawing the farrows over the
corn, which covered it one and a half inches
below the surface.' When the corn was four
inches h gh I harrowed it and thinned it to
two atal f in the hill'.- in about two weeks
softer harrowing, I cultivated itsgabk whkh
was all 'he ti!lage I gave it. We farmers of
the Eastern shore count our corn by the
thousand; I had 88,640 hills on my lot, and 1
think my corn would have been be ter had I
planted earlier:! did not plant until the last
of April I think the planting of corn shallow
and working it with the cultivator is much the
beat way, especially on clover ley. If yon
think the ab >ve worthy of notice you wih
please give it a pla< e in your valuable paper."

a statement of the expense and produst of an
acre of Indi n corn raised by m?L together
i i'
I hilled, bat the cultivator only used ; 5. the
' sod was not disturbed, nor the manure
turned to the surface; and 6. the corn;
was cut at the oround when it was fit
to top. These are the points which we
have repeatedly urged in treating of the
culture of this Cfop; and their correctness
is put beyond question by this notable
result. The value of lime and marl are
well illustrated in the second experiment,
-?conductor,"
Mr, Charles H. Tomlinson, of Sehen*
ectady, New York, in giving en account,
of his experience, says ; vj . *
** The two last years corn has been
raised in the following manner, on the
Mohawk Flats, near this city. If in grass,
the land is ploughed and well harrowed,
lengthwise of the furrow, without disturb,
ing the sward. The ground is then prepared
for planting, by being marked out
two and a half feet one way and three
feet the other. The last season, the field
was rolled after being planted, with evident
benefit, as it made it level. When
the corn is three inches high, the eultiva
tor is passed through both ways! and
twice afterwards it is used in the same
manner; no hills are made, but the
ground is kept level. Neither hand-hoe,
nor plough are us- d, after the corn if
planted. Fields manured with coarse
manure have been illed in the
same manner. Corn tilled in this
way is as clean of weeds, as when
tilled in the usual way: it is no more liable
to be blown down, and the produce is
equally good. It saves a great deal of
hard labor, which is an expensive item in
the usual culture of corn. Last October,
tea rods were treasured out, io two different
places, in a corn field, on grass
?the tine yielding ten, the other nine,
bushels of ears. In one corn-field, after
the last dress:ng in Julvf timothy and
clover se? d were awn, tnd in the fill th
Brass app? ar??<i to havp taken as well as it
has done in adjoining fields where it had been
sown with oats.**
Upon which Judge Buel again remarks:
" All or nearly<all:ttie accounts we have
published of greatjpruducts of I ndian corn agree
in two particulars, vis; in not us'<ng the .
plough m the cul'ure, and in not earthing, or
but very slightly, the Stills. These results go
to demonstrate, that the entire n?ts aru essential
to the vigor of the eiops and to enable
them to perform their functions at nature designed,
must be near the surface. If the roots
are severed with the plough, in dressing the |
crop, the piauts are deprived of a portion of
theit nourishment; and if they are buried
deep by hilling, the plant is partially exhausted
in throwing out a new tit near the sur.
face, where ai'Hie they can perform all their
offices. There is another material advantage
in this mode of cultivating the corn crop?it

Th*? proceeding considerations justify us in
recommending, that >n the management 01
the Indian corn crop, the following rule* he
otwrved or at least partially, so far as to test
their correctness :
t. That the com harrow and cu'tivator be
substituted for the plough in the culture of the
crop.
2 T hat the plants not hilled, or bu*
lightly so?this not to prevent the soil being
oftenstirred and kept clean, and,
3. That in harvesting, the crop be rut at
the ground as soon as the grain is glazed.
Again, in reference to the system of level
cultivation of corn; Judge Bu. 1 remarks;
* The experience of ?ne last two years has
been siiffirmnt to admonish us, that without
due precaution, our croi>s of Indian cora w ill
not pay for the labor bestowed on the cu ture;
and yet, that where due attention has been
paid to soil, manure, seed and harvesting, the
re urn has been bountiful, notwithstanding
bad seasons. Having been uniformly success*
fulin the culture of this crop, we feel justified
in repeating some leading directiona for its
management."
4 ArrBEccLTCTE?In this the plough
should not be used if the corn harrow and
cultivator can be had, and if used, should not
iiifT.irpH in iipnAfrafu the soil more tkan
two or three inches. Th# plough tears the
root*, turns up and wastes the manure, and increases
the injuries of drought. The main
objec is to extirpate weeds, and to keep the
surface nHIo* anu open, that the heat, air
and ino store may exert better their kind in*
flnenres upon the r-getable matter in the
oil. in rouvcrtin< it into nutriment for the
crop At the first dressing with the h>nd
h'?", the plants are reduced to four, or three,
in a hi'l? the surface is broken among the
plants, the weeds careful y extirpated, and a
little fresh mou d gathered to the hill. At
the second dressing, a like process is observed
taking care that the earthing shall not exceed
one inch and a half, that the hill be broad and
flat, and that the earth for this purpose be nut
taken from one place, but gathered from the
surface between the rows, where it has been
loosene* bv the cultivator."
As an evidence of the practical results of
this mode of cultivating corn, I give you in
addition, the statements of two other farmers
of their mode, and of the products of their
land.

correspondent of the Western Farme

the value of mixed clay with sandy soil
Several years since, when a resident <
New England I purchased a piece of di
sandy land, denominated there, "pin
plains," that had been very much wori
, A portion of it, about 1 8-4 acres, waao
. the verge of a deep ravine, and a lit!
: mere elevated than the remainder of tl

I previous to rye, and stocked with clove
, The rye washirvested?in inferior cr<
, ?and the ground, I found in the fall, wi
, not to appearance, more than half stocl
ed. Not having manure for a sprir
, crop, and clay being handy, I carted c
{ to the piece about thirty ox-cart loads <
, clay; this, however, was not pure, bi
supposed to contain about one-thii
, sand; the same was spread upon tl
, surface of the ground in ihe fall. In tl
i spring it had formed a complete coatir
, over the whole surface; the result wi
, a heavy crop of clover. The next sprir

about the 10th May. The result) wa
. about ninety bushels of sound corn, I hi
, corn enough for my own use and so
about fifty bushels for fifty dollars. Th
