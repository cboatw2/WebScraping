tAILILOAD Ovrcz, ST aACusE, Aug. 11. I
Dear Sir: I learn from the passengers
rom the west this morning. that the steam
oat Eric on Lake Erie, was burned at f
he mouth orSilver Creek. with 160 per- (
ons on board, out of which only 27 are r
nown to have escaped. I have my infor
nation from a gentleman who has seen
ome of those who were saved. The par
iculars of the disaster will reach us by
his afternoon train.
I learn that the flames spread with ra
iiiiy iu consequence of the bursting of
ome casks of varnish that were placed
tear where the fire originated.
Yoursin haste, N. GtLL.aont,
?ollectoruf Syracusc and] Utica Railroad.
Vestruction of the Steambat Erie. by fire,
md Loss of nearly Two Hundred Lires.
The steamer Eric lefi Bul'hlo on Mon
Jay afternoon at 3 o'clock lir Chicano.
rhe precise number on board of her is not
mriown, but it is estinated by the captain,
*ron a glance at the register before leav
ng the harbor to have exceeded two hun
led souls. Amongst the number were
ieveral painters, who with their materials
vere on their way to some port up thel
ake for the purpose of painting a boat ly
ng there. A strong wind and rough sen
revailing at the time, Capt. Titus hesita
ed lir some time to put out, but the Do
Witt Clinton having left about three hours
previous, lie was finally induced to start on
he fatal voyage.
At about 8 o'clock the vessel was sud
Jenly wrapped in flames from the burs
tin; of a carboy of varnish on the boiler
leek, whilst so sudden was the combus
ion that the passengers wcre at once for
:ed overboard, in many instances with
yut the slightest article to sustain them.
Fortunately the Do Witt Clintou had
put inito Dutkirk, and discovering the Erie
in flames hastened to her relief.
She picked up twenty seven only of the
whole number on board, w% hil-t about two
hundred fell victims to the devouring ele
mneut. Only one female was saved. as al
o were the captain and one of the crew.
The Erie, in addition to a full comple
ment of passengers, bad on board a large
iuantity of me'rchandize for Chicago and
intieriediate places.
For the above particulars we are indeb
ted to a friend who came down in the boat
tis tnoriing, and they many be relied upon
as correct in all the leading features atten
ding this most melancholy occurrence.
Such are all the particulars we haveyet
received. To tuiht we shall know moreof
thi awful alTiir. None of the passengers'
names are known here and all is suspense,
all anxiety. How dreadful!
We understa:d that the Erie was five
years old, was built and ownedI by Mr.
Reed, of Erie, Penn., and cost $90,000.
She is said to be a splendid and a fast boat,
and of the first class. She was recently
put in complete order, refitted and repain
ted in fine style. She was a great favor
itu'aud hasencountered many a severegale.
This is the third steamer burnt on the
Lake within our recollection. The Great
Western at Detroit, about a year since,
und the Gen. Washingion, several years
ago, iith three hundred passengers.
To showt her size we will give her di
Mensions:

Breadth of beam. 274
Extreme breadth, 514 -'
Her power wastwo Eunded and ifty
torse power, and her burthen ix hundred A
ons burthen. Her commander's name is

The De Witt Clinton which reseuedi
he twetnty persotns lives, is an old boat,
ised for freight arnd patssenigers.
Imamediately on the receipt of the above
>ainful tidings, we issued a third edition,a
ud the city was thrown into a deep sen
aition.
Nut since the hurning of the lien Sher
od, on the Miississipipi, George Washintg

We hoped that nec should learn some

and inlfern(:tces at the expensse of reason. A
State in a condition of ddress, would be I
presumed to speak. as an individual, man
acled and in prison, might be presumed to I
he in the enjoyment of freedom. Far bet- I
tar to say to the States boldly and frankly t
-Congress wills, and subnissiou is de- i
manded.
It may be said that thte directors may i
not establish branches nuder such circun
sanees. But this is a question of power.
and this hill invests them with full authori- I
iy d-t sa, If the Legislature of New York,
or Pennsylvania, or any other State, should
be found to be in such condition as I have
supposed, could there be any security fur
nished against such a step on the part of
the directors? Nay, is it not fairly to be
presttmed that this proviso was introduced
for the solo purpose of meeting the contin- 4
gency referred to? Why else should it
have been introduced? And I submit to I
the- Senate, whether it can be believed that
any State would be likely to sit quietly
down under such a state oftbings? In a
great measure of public interest their pa
triotismn may be successfully appealed to;
but to infer their ansent frut circumstan
ces at war with such inference, I cannot
but regard as calculated to excite a feeling
at fatal enmnity with the peace and harmony
of the country. I must, therefore, regard
this clause as asserting the power to be in
Congress to establish olices of discount in
a State, not only without its assent, but
against its dissent; and so regarding it, I
cannot sanction it. On general principles.
the right in Congress to prescribe terms to
any State, implies a superiority of power
and control, deprives the tratisaction of all
pretence to compact between them, Und I
terminates, as we have seen, in the total
abrogation of freedom of action on the part
of the States. But further, the State may
express, after the most solemn form of le
gislation, its dissent, whicl may from time
to time thereafter be repeated, in full view
of iisown interest, which catt never he sep.
arated front the wise and beneicient ope
ration of this Government; and yet Con
gress may. by virtue of the last proviso,
overrule its law. and upon grounds which,
to such State, will appenr to rest on a con
structive necessity and propriety, and noth
ing more. I regard the bill as asserting
for Congress the right to incorporatc a Uni
ted States Bank with power and right to
establish oflices of dicotnt and deposit in
the several States of this Union, with or
without their consent; a principle to which
I have always hereiofore beett opposed,
and which can never obtain my sanction.
And waiving all other considerntions grow
ing out of its other provisions, I return it to
the Hlouse in which it orginated, with these
my objectious to its approval.
