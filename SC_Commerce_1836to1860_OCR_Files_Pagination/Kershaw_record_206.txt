OF THE

Charleston, s. c.
IN offering to the patronage of the public, a new
literary paper, vre are perfectly aware that we
are hut repeating an oft-tried experiment. Tne result,
however, we would i.tin believe, will be diiier nt.
We arc, it is true, c luscious of tile possession
of no talent or ability superior to thai of our predecessors,
but *v? relv, (perhaps, intleeJ, with too
much '<i the ardor of all experiuio'.ta.) upon the increasing
taste of the age of literature ; a taste, the ]
evi tense of which is before us in tlie uuuiber of pe?
r?ojisn;j, cnja^ea sorely in it* cultivation?i" m?1
yceuns, th>* libraries a id academies Ic voted to sCi- I
race and learning. vVln 1st the North and the
West are thus insidiously employed in the exemplary
task of mental improve ucnt, we will no. suppose
that the South intends longer to hear the
weight of that heavy ineu ..!> is which heretofore
lias wh.I ned it in a:i i itelleotnal slumber more
lasting and profuu ; I thin iliat physical one n'hion
erewhile enwrapped the sovensle *persof F.piies is."
It is with a hope thus f.un i d, and with an in
tentiou if we cannot win success at least to deserve
i". that n >twith-> i i tin >; t iO ua:.''o;m lailurc of those
nh i have precrJ:' 1 i*. we have ventured to c.aim
the patronage .< : i t ? i? >r lor the app ause ol the
public. Tire.- ike ;i ill be played for; how the
game is to end : ie only can determine
Uui object : I be to'iender the columns of the
Bulletin both useful and umusiipj. F? r this pu po-:e,
while one poit: >u is devoted to original l'hsays.
Tales nid .'oe.in. furnished from time to time
by cur correspondents and collaborators, another
p .irtion siiall lie occupied by selected matter culled
tVoui cverv spot of interest and instruction, in the
va-t field <>f literature.
The productions of the press shall pass in leview
before us, and on every work which merits our
notice, an impartial criticism shall he bestowed.?
To light literature and to learned science shall alike
be meted their due portion ot censure or of praise,
and it shall not he our faults if our patrons do not
know the intrinsic value of every hook, ( it least in
onr own opinion) before they begin to read.
He, says Dr. Franklin, who is good at excuses, is
seldom good at any tiling else; and the ?ame we
opine may be said of promises; lest therefore our
readeis come o sonv such conclusion as this. >\e
wiil, without further ido. make our how, and l<? tve
them in future to judge from our . ihors whether we
do, or do not, deserve their patronage.

devoted to the le ale portion of the community

THE VlUrf! AL DEl'AltI'MKNT
Is under the supervision of Mr. J. YVatson, whose
qualiiications fort ic task arc too w<H known to require
our testimony.
This department of the Ladies' Companion, has
ever commanded a large share of attention, and has
been looked upon with no little interos' hy its readers,
and more especially the Ladies, whom the
publisher is in the highest legrec anxious to please.
It will continue to he n subject of "iore than usual
care to him, and to the Professor under whose su|K>rvision
it is placed, to make that portion of the
magazine alotted to music, more than ever doserving
of the countenance of every lover of music. It has
i.i.nn .... i ...;n ... i... i,
ill pieces of music printed correctly and lree from
errors.
THE WORK IN GENERAL.
Over every department an equally careful super
vision will .ic strict I v exorcised by the Editors, and
all appropriate expenditures will be liberally bestowed
as it is tlie -'csign oftlie publisher, with the aid of his
contributors and the advice of bis friends to make
the Ladies' Companion distinguished for the beauty
and accuracy of its typography?the variety ami
high tone of its literary articles?the quality and
value of its music?and the unequalled splendor of
its pictorial embelishments.
It is the deter litiilton of the publisher to use everv
moans to maintain the superiority which the Ladies'
Companion has obtained. For four years lie
has steadily pursued a course ot improvement, and
he (l itters himself that his present facilities are such
as to give the Ladies' Companion eminent advantages
overall other publications of its character.
From the foregoing it will lie perceived that the
Ladies' Companion embraces every department withI
in the range of Belles-Lett res and the Fine Arts;
and no exertions or expense will he deemed too great
to render the work equal to any other extant. The
fluttering and general testimonials of nearly every
contemparary journal in the United States, and in
fact, many 011 the other side of the Atlantic, have
strongly asserted the Undeniable claims of the Ladies'
ompanion to the support of the public general|
ly. There is no work that gives its readers such a
i great return for their subscripti >m.
The Prize Articles will all be published during the
| year. These articles will coin irisc the successful
cumuuaies lor inn premiums ni one tlion.satcl dollars

PATU.V* COVlOU
HIS Gin can be made double. or single. If
\ made double, they reduce labor, and gin just
double, the quantity ot cotton over the single cylinder
Gin, uo other k:id having been in use prevous
to this patent; and wheuicr single or double, they
are lound to improve the quality of the cotton, by
more perfectly cleaning it. They can be maue to
contain from tiO to il>U saws in a stand, and whether
small or large, one hand will be sullicieut to attend
them. The Gins have mechanicui feeders and
hoppers attached to them, which free the cotton
Ironi leaves, trush, dirt, ?.Vc. before it can reach the
saws, and by tnc thorough buckling operation it
receives from the feeders, which make two revolutions
to one of (he saws, it is almost- hi a nail
giued slate, before it descenus to the saw. 11 y a
very simple arrangement of a screw to each set ct
gaates, on winch tin- hoppers rest, and through
which llie teeth of the feeders pass, they can be
liride to teed slow or last to suit, the condition of
the cotton at the time. \V hen made double, the
saws are placed on two sets of cylinders and turn
upon each other in opposite directions,' and are

lutions to one of hvo saw. The two cylinder* can
be detached uo as lo enable.the planter to run one
or both at pleasure, although embraced with leeders,
&c. in one stood. The whole is put in operation
with a drum and hand, as in the ordinary Gin, and
inuy be propelled by horse, steam, or water power.
It may also be propelled by iron running gear.
The torce required to work it, is about the same as
that necessary to move on equal number of sawsin
the common Gin. This Gin lias been put in
operation in Mew Orleans for two or three weeks,
and its success tested in the presence of a large
number of planters, merchants and others, and
received their general approbation
Several gentlemen have been so kind as to give
the Patentee their written opinion icspecting the
merits of the Gin. A number of others couid be
added, but the following are deemed sufficient:

These favorable impressions of the advantages of

Messrs. Sandford Greene, i have seen your

J cotton ginned by it, and pronounce it better clean

that ever came under my observation. It is completely
ready (or the breaker without the aid ofthe
blower, arid would, therefore, save the first process
in manufacturing the article. I consider cotton
cleansed by your (Jin, would command from one

The Gins ordered will be delivered to the agents,
of planters in any of the sea port towns of the cotton
planting Slates, at the above prices, the agents
paying the freight on the same from New York,
and becoming responsible for !he amount of the Gin.
It is desirable,when planters give orders for Gins,
they should accompany them with their views in
regard 10 tne arrangement of saws, breasts, brushes,
&c. It is found they difler in opinion. Some
desire saws of larger diameter than others. The
most common size is 1) or 10 inches; hut some wish
them lii inches. Some wish 5 or 0 rows of brushes
j on an axle, while others do not want more than 4
I at most. Some wish saws with 8 or 9 teeth to the
inch, while others want 10 or 11. With so much
discrepancy, we prefer they should, at the time of
giving orders, furnish a statement of their wishes,
and the manufacturercrs can fulfil them in every
particular. Where it is left to our discretion, we
shall make tlirm on the most modern and approved
plan. A n order can be executed, from the lime it
is received, in the space of eight or nine weeks
and the Gin in that time placed in the hands of the
factor. To be in time for the next crop, all orders ,
ought to be in the haiide of the manufacturers by i
the first or middle of May; except for plantations )
where they arc late in commencing to pick or gin
cotton.
