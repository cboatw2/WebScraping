a nasty one."

Fifty-one Indians, men, women, and picaninnies,

A large amount of American property is
alleged to have been sequestered at Tampico
under the authority of the Mexican
Government. The following account of
the circumstances connected wi'h the proceeding
is given by the Baltimore American,
from the Mobile Journal :
" Tampico was, for a season, in the full
possession of Mexia and the Federalists;
and the French Admiral, desirous to favor
that parly, excepted Tampico out of the
general blockade of the Mexican ports.
This led to large and valuable shipments
from the United States, especially fr <m the
port of Now Orleans. The Mexican Government
retaliated by a decree, dated on
the 8th of January, when they were absolutly
without power in Tampico or ;he vi? in ty,
by which decree that port was closed
against all commerce coastwise or foreign.
o o
Ou the defeat and death of Mexia, rhe con
sequent triumph of the Centralists, nnd
die occupation of Tarnpico by Bustumente,
the Government proceeded to enforce rigidly
the decree ? f January 8th,and issued orders
to the coll' c'or and military commandant
of the place to seize on all goods imported
after the publication of that decree,
and demanded secur iy for ail th t have
been sold, unless the shippers can prove that
they had not been duly informed of the decree
in qu stion. The value of American
property in jeopardy is said to be a million
of dollars at least, and the Mexican author
itics have sufficient need of the money to |
make them very little scrupulous in the
grounds of condemnation. Thero is a
great deal of interest felt in this matter in
in New Orleans, where a large part of the
property is owned; and it is loudly contended
that the actual possession of the port
by the Federalists, with an adequate force
to keep it so long against the power of the
Government, was a sufficient evidence to
foreigners of their right to control its commerce
; and that, accordingly, any attempt
of the Central Government to enforce the
penalities of decrees which it was unable to
put into effect when issued, is a violation of
L - ? C t mnMnon oififono fi ?p which
ine ngllUt Ul AIHL-iivuu vmsuiioi ?.
they call for the interposition of our Government."
"We suspect,'* adds the American,
* however, that the better defence for the
endangered property is the fact, sufficiently
well ascertained, that the Mexican decree in
question was never officially notified in this
country ; and that, in consequence, it will
be in the power of every American citizen
to show that he never had official knowledge
of its existence."

The workmen employed in this great undertaking
have succeeded in reac hing lowwater

Tornado.-?A violent tornado passed in
the vicinity of Newark, N. J. on Wednesday
last, whose force it seems was nearly
equal to the well.remembered New Brunswick
tornado. Some individuals at work
upon the salt meadows, hearing ihe noise
of its approach, took refuge in a solitary
house, and were scarcely in when the spout
swept over the house with awful power,
carrying away the whole upper story, and
leaving two of hi family, who had fled to
the second floor, with no other covering
than tho broad canopy above. The barn
and out Jiouses on the north were shivered
into ruins, and the fragments scattered two
and three hundred yards along the path of
the s'orm. A horse and wagon at the door
were turned completely ov<t, the wagon
and harness torn t orn the horse, passing
lengthwise over him, and shivered into
atoms, the strongest iron joints being torn
asunder. U. S Gazette.
THE AMISTED.
We learn, frem the New York pipers,
that on Wednesday, the 18th instant, on
mo ion of the counsel for the three African
girls, who were not implicated in the criminal
charge, and were not bound over to !
await the action of the grand jury, a writ of
habeas corpus was issued, directing the
he marshal to bring them up; tl.a* on
Thursday, after various I bels and claims in
relation to the Amistad had been read and
fihd, the three girls were brought up; that
on the next day, the return of the habeas

corpus was elaboruiely argueci ; ana mat
the Court delivered its charge to tho grand
jury, ins'ructing them that the act for which
Cinguez and his associates stood charged,
having been committed on board a Spanish
vessel, was not cognizable in our courts.
The Court had previously decided that the
negroes could not be held underSthe claim
of Lieut. Gcdney for salvage. The decisions
on these two points greatly simplify
the case, and will probably lead to a speedy
disposition of all tho questions involved in
it. Nat. IntelI.
New York, September 24.
In the case of the Africans of the Arais'ad,
Judge Thompson has dismissed ihe
writ of habeas corpus, and denied the motion
lor the hberaiion of the Africans, upon
which motion they are taken back to jail,
and the case is to be examined in November
before the D strict Court. The Court
then adjourned sine die.
It is not certain whether the capture took
nLce within the limits of the state of New
York or on the high seas. If the former
the district court of Connecticut where the
case is now pending has no jurisdiction ol
it; it must come before t' e Distric c rnrt
of New York. If the cap:ure was inade
at sea, then, any distiict court has jurisdiction.
Measures have been taken to ascertain
whether the point at which the capture
took place is within the juiisdiction of the
Admiralty or common law courts. This
will be done before the sitting of the court
in November.

of the routine of proceeding in organizing the

which affords the members who wish to pro*

to us handed necessary to occupy room with
more than we havo copied. We hope the intelligent

AGRICULTURAL SUMMARY.
The Tennessee Farmer mentions a calf belonging
to a neighbor of the editor which when
just three moi ths old, weighed 360 lb. and a
heifer which, when one year old weighed 690
lb. The fo-mcr is a full blood Durham, and
the latter half blood.
The same paper says; "A full blood short
horn Durham calf belonging to Henry & Ran*
dall, of Cortlandvilie, weighed wh*>n one day
old, one huudred and twenty four peunds."
Wo learn from the American Farmer that
Agricultural Fairs, for the sale of live stock
are about to be instituted in the state of Maryland.
The first is to be held at Eilicot's Mills
on the 130th of the present month.
Dr. Muse states in the last number of the
same paper that he planted the corn, consisting
of 500 grains, from one ear of the "China
or Tree Corn," or. the 17th of April, in drills
5 feet apart, 18 inches in the drill, and one grain
at a point. The ground had been previously
rolled after plowing. He afterwards used only
the "Cultivator" except once p owing highly
about the middle of June. He gathered nearly
one thousand ears, generally larger than the
one planted; though many smaller. He fully
believes that if he had succored the corn his product
would have been much greater. The corn
was sufficiently matured for meal by the middle
of August, at least two months earlier than
the common corn. His seed he procured from
Grant Thorbum, who first cultivated this variety
of corn in the United States. Is it not
probable therefore that those persons whose
expectations have been disappointed m the
corn raised by them for China corn had been
imposed upon by spurious seed 1
An Agricultural meeting was to be held in
Cheshire county Main, on the 25th ult. which
was to be addressed by the Hon. Isaac Hill,
formerly U. S. Senator, and afterwards Governor
of the state.
Mullicaulis in Louisiana.?The Louisiana
Advocate of Sept, 14th, states that at that
time trees from one bud cuttings planted last
spring had attained, in the neighborhood of
Covington, a height of from 12 to 15 feet in
good soil, and on the ordinary soil of the wodtfs,
from 8 to 10 feet. A leaf from a tree reared
by Mr. VV. Bagley of the same village, meas.
ured 16 inches by 14 1-2, and weighed 273
grains. That the value ofihe tree is duly
estimated there, may be infered from the fact
that for one tree three years old 825 were
paid, although 'here are several hundred thousand
trees now growing in the Parish.
Two steamboats came in collision lately on
the Potomac, and one of them was so much injured
as soon to sink to the waters edge. The
passengers escaped to the other boat. The
published account does not state how so rep*
rehensible carelessness occured.
A fire lately originated in the National
Theatre N. York city, and destroyed that
building with three churches which stood near,

Dutch Reformed Churches.
THE DAGUERREOTYPE.
The secret ofM. Daguerre's wonuerful!
veation which represents on paper the exact
picture of any scenery whatever, has been
made public The publication was first made
by the inventor to (he Academy of Sciences.
We copy below the concluding part of an ana.
lysis of his lecture or exposition, which states
the process.
We now come to the great discovery in the
. rocess for which M. Daugerre has received
a national reward. It is t > the following effect
: A copper sheet, plated with silver, well
cleaned with diluted nitric acid, is exposed to
the vapor of iodine, which forms t ie first coat*
ingr, which is very thin, as it does not exceed
the millionth part of a metre in thickness.?
There are certain indispensable precautions
necessary to render thi? coating uniform, the
chief of which i6 the using of a rim of metal
round the sheet. The sheet, thus prepared,
is placed in the camera obscura, where it is
allowed to remain from eight to ten minutes*
It is then taken out, but the most experienced
eye can detect no trace of the drawing. The
sheet is now exposed to the vapor of mercury,
and, when it has been heated to a temperature
of 60 degrees of Reaumur, or 167 Fahrenheit,
the drawings come forth a6 if by enchantment.
One singular and hitherto inexplicable fact in
this process is, that the sheet when exposed
to the action of the vapor, must be inclined ;
for if itjwere placed in a direct position over
the vapor, the results would b>' loss satisfactory.
The angle used is 48 d grees. The last
part of the process is to place the sheet in the
hyposulphite of soda, ana then to wash it in a
large quantity of distilled water. The descrip.
tion of the process appeared to excite great in.
tefest in the auditory, amongst, whom we observed
many dis'inguiehed persons connected
with science and the fine-arfs.
Unfortunately the locality was not adjusted
suitable for the performance o M. Dagurrc's
experiment but we understand that arrangements
will be made for a public exhibition of
fhetu. Three htgtily carious drawings, obtained
in this, manner wore exhibited?one of
the Pont Marie, another of M. Daugerre's atelier,
and a third of a room containing some
rich carpeting, all the minutest threads of
which were represented with the most mathematical
accuracy, and with wonderlul richness
of effect.

MelanchoUy Occurrence.?which resulted in
the death of tour men, citizens of the adjoining
county of Chambers, in the state of Alabama,
was detailed to us yesterday; and from the
respectability of its source we have no doubt
of its truth. We have not been able to obtain
the names of the sufferers
It appears that a well, in the neighborhood
of Standing Rock, in the county above mentioned,
having failed to yield its usual supply op
water, the owner determined to have it cleaned
out. A person was let down by the well bucket
and rope, but showed no s gns of action when
at the bottom?he was called to, but did not
answer. A second proposed to go down and
ascertain what was the matter, and he also, as
, soon as he arrived at the bottom, became sui
pine and silent. A third proposed to go down,
with the understanding that ho was to be
drawn up as soon as he called out, the persons
present then suspecting for the first time, that
there was some mephytic gas at the bottom of
the well. He went down, but it was only to
join his unfortunate companions. When he
got nearly to the foot of the well, he called to
be drawn up ; but when about half way up, he
fell from the bucket! A fourth then proposed
that he should be lashed fast, and he would de.
soend, with the understanding also that he
should be hauled up as soon as he called out.
He had descended but lit'ie more than half
way when he gave the word; they drew him
up quickly, but had barely time to unlash him
before lite was extinct. The other three were
i
then taken out of the well with graplee, but
pone of them showed the least signs of life?*
the vital spark was forever extinguished!
This melancholy catastrophe happened on
Thursday and the bodies of the unfortunate
sufferers were all consigned to the grave on
Friday last.
A train of tweoty-three dars, all well stored

and quarter, or more in circumference. Such
cuttiu s, as I know from last spring's experience,
grow almost as certainly as rooted plants, even
with bad management in an unfavorable season,
more especially when grown themselves from
rt o!ei plants, as is the case with many of those
here offered. It is confidently believed that very
few if any lotsoftroes are for sale in the country
which afford so larire a number of so pood cut.
tings. They are worth visiting from a'distancc
by a person wishing to purchase so great a num.
ber of trees or cuttings of prime quality. Tho
present price is 12$ cents per foot, or 2 cents per
bud. A reasonable deduction would be made to
a purchaser of the whole lot. The field on which
tho trees stand is within a few hundred yards of
tho Cheraw boat landing, from which thoro is
regular steamboat communication with Geor^o
Town and Charleston.
Tho postage must be paid on all letters on tho
subject or they will not attended to.
