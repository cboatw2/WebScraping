Interfere, directly or indirectly, with the right of

it woald fere* the managers (several of whom

comply with this order. The object then of his
Excellency, in getting out the citizens at that time
for military drill will ip a great meat ore be defeat'
nd hence the necessity of a change.

Trias and Urn. Gaints.?From two gentlemen?one
an officer in the Toxian Army j
and the other of tho United States Army un? j
dcr Gen. Gaines?who arrived here the day j
before yesterday, we hato plump contradic- :
/ten of a number of items of Texas new?, i
manufactured iu New Orleans, and that vi-;
cioky. 1
In the first place, General Rusk never has
retreated from the MejiciDssnd stil! is where
he was when be heard of the increase to the
Mexican force?viz: at Victoria, 2dly, Gen.
Gaines not gone to Nacogdoches nor cues he
intend to.
One of the gentlemen to whom we hare
alluded left the lines of the Texian army on
the 6ih July, the other left Natchitoches on
the 23d, and the Amercan camp a Terv few
days before. Dp to his departure from Natchitoches
he heard of no such morement ou the
port of General Gaines, nor has the most distant
idea that such a movement has been
thought of.
The Mexican army were sickly and discontented
and the disagreement between their;
leaders continued. The Texian army were'
in good condition and numbered upwards of.
2500 and were daily increasing. Santa An-1
! na was still closely confined?nor do oar in*
formants believe (hat he bad requested the
United States to act as mediator between
Mexico and Texas.
RAIL ROADS,
i We pee it mentioned that in part of the
level country <?f Mississippi is estimated a
contemplated Railroad trill cost a thousand,
dollars the mile.
This corroborates the opinion which has
been expressed in this paper, regarding the
expense of a Rati Road to Charleston, ffc
* a ? IJ _ '
believe mat io,uuu aouars wouiu carry a single
track to the Sanicc, and that in the beat
manner.
Our friends in Chcraw ooght to think of
! this. Fayettcrilic is by her enterprise and
exertion daily taking away business that naturally
belong to the former place.
Camden is also an interested party. A
Railroad from Santcc to Charleston would
' afford her the best and cheapest commani
cation with Charleston.
We >.are heard it asked, " what is Georgetown?"
It would not bo difficult to answer
this sneer by another. But a sneer is no
argument. We hope to be able to show indeeds
not in words?what Georgetown is. In
peaking of Georgetown we of course refer
to mat paruou 01 ioc oiaic wikmc interest
arc the tame, and whose commerce is injo-!
red by Georgetown Ikr.
It has Ik?cii said thai the Pee Dec country
being ao contiguous to Rip. bad caught the j
infection. and was a* profoundly asleep as
the slumbcrtr himself. Rip bowcrer has
roused himself?look at the enlerptizo and
activity of Wilmington. Perhaps we shall
awake too. There arc symptoms.

The Grand Riccr Murders.?On hearing j
of the murder* lately committed upon the;
Grand rirer, in this State, Colonel Keir-j
ney, of the dragoons, despatched Captain
Duncan to inquire into the particular! of
the alTair. His account] has been communicated
to tho Execulirc of the State, and
is as follows:
"The party of Pottowalamies were
emigrating from Skunk rirer, on the Mississippi.
where ihey spent lite list winter
with their families, to join those of their
nation now on the opposite side of the
Mississippi rirer, and that the tire en
gaged in the affair were out as a hunting
party, for the purpose oi killing provisions
for the qsc of their families; that, on
the preceding evening, they wetv visited
by five white men, who came to their
camp with whiskey (or sale, but that they
I refused either to puVei asc or be treated
I witli it. About daylight, in the morning
on which the transaction took place, they
discovered that eight of their horses were
missing, and saw, by the signs, that they
had been stolen, and presumed that they

miles, ihey saw a smoke in a thicket,
where they found their horses in posses*
ion of the same white men who had been
with them iho previous evening, when a
Sac, who had a PoUowatamie wife, and
who was living with the nation, stepped
up to the white men and claimed the
horses; thia he had scare ly done before be

the inan who had killed him. when the remaining
