Agricultural.

Mr. Iitor.-At the presetit gloomy
period of depression in our great siaple. it
is a con-olation to learn that there are
resources of agricultural prosperity hither
to unknown and unuispected among t1%,
which every day is bringing to light. ' I
allude to the existence of inexha4tible de
posits of the richest of all manures -Marl
and Lime, with which the State aboutind;
amply sullicient with *skill and enterprize.
to resuscitate the drooping agriculture of
Sout h Carolita. Is ik a Tac:. (the discosv.
cry of but a few weeks) that this Di~trict
is rich in aise mineral treasur.-s : of far
more value than gold mines in th- eyes ofthe
political philosopher. One or two depos
its of this kind have hcen known for seve
ral years. But in t1e cours'e of but a few
weeks Marl of the best quality has been
discovered in fiftys dilerent localities with
in a short distance of this place. And it
is confidently believed that it underlies
this whole section of country. What
a startog fact is this, for (lt desponding
agricul'urist if South Carolina I Here
we were, year after year torturing over
exhausted lands that could he matte to
vield but a small and relpctant return for
all our labors, and not dteaming that stch
rare treasures lay but a few feet beneath
the soil we daily trod, and that our fathers
trod before us. Is it not amazittg that this
discovery should never have been made
before.
I have often heretofore thought how
highly I should priz;, a rici tied of M arl
upou toy plantation, nithout, how ver.
the most distant expectation of retlizing
in titat locality such a blessimg. In the
carly part of November last, I saw
several specimens of very fine Marl, then
jis, disc.:vered in different paits of this
District, Soon after, public dities called
me from home for four weeks. During
mny a)sence, the spirit of research aid the
progress of discovery went on. A id on
in return. I learned tihat my neighbors
had discovered Marl in all directions
around mv". This of course stimulatied
me to nake rrploration. Accordingly on
one of the Christmas holidays, I sallied
forth with a retinue consisting of tity over
seer and two or three stout negro men,
and armed with no other or better imple.
ments than a spatle and a two itich augur
fixed in a long wooden shaft or - hantle.
In a half hour afier a'rriving at the suispec
ted localitv, I succedcd in bringing up
some of the finesi Marl I have ever seen.
It was withii three and a half leet of the
'surfce of the grotind, and lay it the centre
of my domain, ztd presetnts no dillicuhy
in* being worked a-d hatied (out. It
proves to be a very rich aid extensire
deposit. amply stiicietit to manure thou
sands of acres, and probably inexihuutible.
And I have strong reasons for believing
that I have on my plantations a number
of other and similar dCp.sits.
IMy motive.Mr. Ediior. in inditing this
article, is 'the hlipe that it may exite
others to make examinations for this lire
cious material. There are thousauids upon
thtonisds of unsuspected localities in
which it tmay be found. It abounis tno
doubt throughoni the middle and low
country of this State. 1, thi not an inte
resting fact for our impeverishod Caroli
na !
The indications which exist here as la
the presence of Marl, may not apply 1,1
other regions of the State. it nay fte as
well hiow~ever, ihr me to say, that we
geteratlhy see~k it in branches or sprintg
heads near somte creek. Thie grow ithif
vegetation. which has bteen tiost genera!ly
thurnd asociatedI with it, is tmyrtlIe. (tht
dodendro a.) bambt to biar an a oi specie< tif
vine called rattan. I have not seetn nua
place in which Marl wvas not found neriv
the siurfaice, in which come of the forego
ing growth was tot tneair antd aroui.

subject has engaged the attention of sev
eral intelligent and public spirited individ
nals. The plamt grows will in many parts
of the south of Europe. The rot is pe
rennial, long-creeping, about as large as a
q'uill. and red both without and within
frim it arise several trailing, quadrangular
stems, rough. branching. and two or three
feet in length ; the leaves are oblong, oval
and pricky on the margin and mid-rib;
tho flowers are yellow and small and are
disposed in a pasicle, at the 'extremity of
the branches, and the axils of the superior
leaves; they make their appearance in
June and July, and are succeeded by hhtek
ikh herri.s. The most approved method
of culture is from seed, and when this prac
tire is pursued. certain precautions are re
qusite. As the madder of hot climates
affords more colortng matter, as well as a
deeper tint. if is best for those who live in
a northerti region to import the seed from
ihe sooth. Again, wheu the seed is too
ntich dried, it will remain in the grountd
two years hefbre it will erninate. Ott
tis account, it should be kept in a hed of
moistened earth of sand, whenever there
is any deln io sowing it. A light, rich
and deep s!'il is the imost suitahl.-, and it
shull be plough-d to the depth of two
feer-. The time of sowing is in Fedruary,
or tie heginniug of March. for the northern,
and in Septemb r or October for the inore
southern regions.
"This kind of crop requires but little
care and attention. For the first year,
it is only necessary to keep it free from
weeds, and to hoe it slightly once during
the suinmer,and again a little more dee
ply in the later pllrt of the se-ison ; the
same is req ired the third y var, except
that the earth is heaied .:ttout the s!ttms.
in order to inke il sh .ot up with tmtore

before the wecond i time of hoeing, to cit the

some writers, or tie roots will suffer. It
is only at the end of the third year. that
the crop is retly for harvesiing ; and if it
is suflered to remain in the ground beyond
this period, more is lost th in gained. The
toots at this time coniain the greatest
quantity (of coloring matter, and have at

obtatciig the roots is the following * A
