The President's Message.-We have
not had room in our paper, until this
week, to publish this important and high
ly interesting message. It gives we
believe, the correct statement of the dilli
culties between Maine, and New Bruns
wick. In order that our readers might
well understand this question, we have
thouight proper to lay this State paper be
fort- them, in prererence to the iartial.,
and distorted accounts of the various Jour
nats w'hich have made- publications upos
it. Members of Congress of all parties, in
the generous spirit of patriotism, threw a
side all political differences, and gave-it
their warmest approbation.
Sale of Bank Stock.-We extract from
ihe Charleston Courier, the following ac
count of the late sale of Stock in the Bank
of Hamburg.
"The sale of 200.000 dollars of the in.A
creased capital of the bank of Hamburg,, '
wts completed at that place in two hours, -
ith nuch life and spirit. The stock sold
at a premium of 6 to 7 dollars per share,
'ho arerage being 124 per cent premium
for the new stock-the new stockholders to -
One in on the 1st July.. This is-the way
they do things in Hamburg.
A plain hint.-The editor of the Grena
da Bulletin, (Miss.) latly called the at
ientiin of his renders to the advertisement
of --New Gouds," published in his, paper.
He praised the goods highly, andrecom
mended them to the public. But mark
what lie says about sonie tmerdhits, who
did not patronize his paper. "T-hree or
four other new stocks of goo(s have lately
been opened in town. They don't-adver
tise with us, and consequently,' vo can't
tell what they have." This is a good
hint to merchants, to advertise.
Mr. J. 0. 13. Ford, of Hamburg, So.
Ca., and Mersrs. G. L. & E. Penn & Co.
mdiu BIland. Catlin & Co. of this place, have
conmmenced the good work by sending Ad
vettisements to the "~Edgefield Adverti
~er." To these w'e refer our readers.

Sthe time to build up our commercial
