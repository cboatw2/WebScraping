TUE MASSACnUSETTs RESOLUTIots R.
PORTED ON.
To-day a report was made to the House
by Mr. Gilmer and Mr. Burt. from the Se
lect Committee on the Massachusetts
Resolutions; and it has been ordered to
be printed, with any other reports which
may be made; we presume, expecting
other reports from the other members of
the committee. The report is long, and
we will lay it before our readers as soon
as it is printed. In the mean time we
present below to our readers the resolu
tions with which it concludes. They are
right in substance and tone, and we trust
will bo adopted by the House. The
Southern States have a right to demand
repose on this subject of their slave insti
tutions; nor will they be satisfied until it
is 'obtained. The multiplied forms in
which they have lately been assailed, we
fear may rouse a spirit which may not ea
sily be allayed ; and all true friends of tho
Constitution should therefore join in reso
lute opposition, and decided condemna
tion, of the course of those who would
overturn it. An equivocal position on
such great questions, is contempitiblo. A
man who advocates a change in any Go
vernment, which he knows will abolish it,
is its enemy ; and in every Government
there are certain great attributes which
are unalterable, consistent with their exis
tence. It is not unconstitutional to op
pose in the Parliament of Great Britain,
that a king should be dispensed with, or
that the House of Commons should be
abolished. Such propositions are consti
tutional, because. Parliament is omnipo
tent ; but who would doubt that the pro
poser of them was an enemy to the exist
ing constitution, and designed its over
throw. So also,' in the Constitution of
the United States, there are certain great
compromises which gave it life, and which
alone continue it. Such are the represen
tation of the States, as States and equals
in the Senate, and the representation in
the House of Representatives of three
fifths of the slaves. To propose in Con
gress to alter and abolish the Constitution,
in either of these particulars, although
perfectly constitutional, because Congress,
by a voteof three-fourths, can propose any
amendments to the States, is, neverthe
less, proposing and seeking a dissolution
of the Union. To propose that the Con
stitution should be amended, so as to make
a king, would be. in a parliamentary sense,
constitutional ; but it would, too, be trea
son to that sacred instrument. In fact,
any measure, whether in the shape of
amendments proposed to the Constitution,
or in any other form, which aim at its
overthrow, by being incompatible with its
existence, is as flat treason as being taken
in arms against the country. The latter
may be far less noxious than the former;
and, therefore, far more venial. There
are Arnold's now we fear in peace, with
out his gallantry in war-wretches, who
would fire a house at midnight, and revel
int a massacre; hut who in the open field,
vnld cry "tinarter." before a charge is
made.
The following are the resolutions ap
pended to Mr. Gilmer's report -
" Resolved, That it is inexpedient to
propose ihe amendment to the Constitu
to, whtch has been suggested by the Le
gislature of M. assachesetis.
" Resolved, That the faith of the 13
Revolutionary States wss solemnly pled
ged to each other to maintain the Consti
tution in all its provisions- for the security
of the citizens of the United States, and
their rights of property; and that we re
new and will redeem the pledge of our
fathers against the dangers of all foreign
or domestic foes, with "our lives, our for
tunes, and our sacred houor."~
From the Washington Spectator.
VIRGINIA.
On Th~rsday last Governor McDowell
trasmitted to the House of Delegates the
resolutions of the Legislature of Massa
chusetts, recommending an amendment to
the Constitution, remarking, that "-they
propose to destroy one of the fundagiental
compromises of the Fedetal Constitution,
without which, substantially, that instru
ment would never have existed, and never
can exist."
In the evening, the following resolutions,
submitted by Mr. Byrd of.Frederick, were
adopted by a unanimotes vote of the House
of Delegates:. -
Resolved by the General Assembly of
Virgna, That the resolutions passed by
the House of Representatives, on the,15th
of January 1844, and by the Senate, on the
16th day of January, 1844, of the Gene
ral Assembly of the State of Massachu

municated to this General Assembly by the
Governor of Virginia, and also resolutions
of the same body upon the same subject,
adopted March 23, 1843, and communica
ted to this House by the Governor of this
Comonweahth along with his late annual
message, proposingman amendtnent to 'the
third clause of the second section of the
first article" of "the Constitution of the

Resolved, also,:That the Governor of

CottdniMaket;nd the nature of the strug
gle .whicl has commenced between the
blanchester'.Spinners and .the Liverpool
Speculators. The Manchester Guardian,
the. authorative organ of the former, thus
expresses itself in an editorial article of the
3d inst.
The Cotton Market.-The present state
of- the Liverpool cotton market is one, we
fear, boding the mostserious consequences
to the trade of this large manufacturing
district. So -far from the excitement in
that market having subsided, it seemed to
become higher, and we may add, more
feverish. We have heard, on authority
deserving of consideration, that a large cap
italist was known to be in the market with
cash to the extent of 4800,000 for invest
ment (if it can he called so) in cotton; and
the impulse of speculation which such'a
circumstance must give, in a greatly excited
market, may be easily conceived. Much
we are told, was said of making the "Man
chester bears" (as our spinners and manu
facturers were called, because of buying no
more than their immediate necessities re
quire) suffer. in pocket by the operations
now in progress; and we are apprehensive,
from what we have heard in various quart
ter, that by these speculations on both
sides the Atlantic. another check is again
about to be applied ti arrest that trade,
which has so recently manifested tokens
of a gradual return to a more healthy and
prosperous state. Without being under
s-ood as adopting the views or the sugges
tions of the writer, we may refer our read
ers to the letter, an another column, of "A
Spinner and Manufacturer," as exhibiting
a striking proof, at least, of his estimate of
his estimate of the impending mischief.
That evil must, indeed, be enormous,
which could induce a gentleman largely en
gaged in manufacture. and in the situation
in other respects which he describes, to
propound the proposition,-that, in the
event of the present reported shortness of
the cotton crop being verified, all the spin
ers and manufacturers of the district
should work short time for the next ten
months, and during five of these months,
from May to September, cattlyfite days a
week.
This state of things, much as it is to be
regretted, has by no means come upon us
by suprise. In an article on the state and
prospects of the cotton market. in our
bublication of the 17th nlt. we expressed a
decided impression that the aspect of the
cotton market, at that time, both at Liver
pool and at the principal ports of the U. S.
was calculated-to inspire serious apprehen
sions - for the continuance of the recent im
rovement of the cotton manufacture of
tbis country. On that occasion, we sta
ted that our intention was to guard the spin
ners and manufactures against the tenden
cy to wild and extravagant speculation,
then begining to manifest itself. Referring
to the prudence with which. in 1825, in
1839, and on other occasions, they had cho
sen rather to diminish their honrs of work
ing, or even to close their mills entirely,
than run the risk of heavy loss, by pur
chasing cotton at prices forced up by gam
bling speculations, we expressed the con
viction that a time was rapidly approach
ing when they wou!d have to protect them
selves against a repetition of the same dlan
gers; and that protection could be found
only in the exercise of the prudence and
caution which they hiad displayed on for
mer cccasions. Trhat time has now arrived.
Hitherto the trade lies generally evinced
much firmnness in resisting, the ad vance, by
declining to purchase; and w-e are glad to
see, by an advertisement in onr first page,
convening a meeting of spinners anI mnatn
u~facturers for Tuesday next, at 3 o'clock,
that an early opportunity is to be alforded
fur a conference on this important subject.
We trust that it will be numerously atten
ded by gentleman of various branches of
manufactures from al parts of the district;
and that that unanmity which can alone
carry them safely through this peril, which
prevail throughout their counsels and de-.
terminations. Much, very much, depetnds
at this juncture, upon the course generally
adopted by the trade in a matter vitally,
affecting, not only their own interest, but|
also die well being of that large and indus
trious class which is wholy dependent on.

in every part of the Island. A merica pro-I
duce was low and not in much demand.
The French charge, M. Barrot, left Port
Republican on the 20th, without having ef
fected any arrangement with the Haytien
government. In the first place, he pro
posed to let twelve years pass before any
claim for a debt should be presented to
,them, provided they would give to French
vessels an exclusive privilege of trading to
the Island. This was indignantly refused
in true negro style. "Worrah, ear ! we not
going to do dat. Then he proposed to give
them five years without interest ott the
debt, provided French vessels were ad mit
ed on payment o'fhalf tonnage duties. The
black philosophers in power, rolled up the
white of their eyes at his, looked at each
other, and replies as the Haytian officer
did recently to an American Midshipmain
who had landed him on a pier at Port au
Prince from the sloop-of-war Baiubridge.
"Here, sar, take die," throwing the middy
a quarter of a dollar with an extravagant
toss of the bead. "go board your ship and
transact your duties !" The Midshipman
oketed the quarter atnd went ; so did
i Barrot with a part of the French debt.
It thus appears that M. Barrot has re
turned bome and the Hlaytiens abide by
the treaty or 1830. They have paid $350.

.gether with tbe extracr inm relation to au
nexation from-the Houston Telegraph of
the9th inst.. All was rejoicing in Galves
ton'when the Nepitune left. Here is the
letter of our correspondent :
HousTorn, Feb. 10, 1344.
To the Editors of the Pcayupe :
I take great pleasure in communicating
to you the important intelligence contain
ed in the enclosed slip. The facts stated
I think may be implicitly relied upon. It
only confrms what has recently been com
municated in private letters from some of
the most distil:ouished statesmen in the
United States. it is to be regreued that
our Congress did not keep together a few
days longer (they adjouroed'on the 5th
instant.) If they bad, the thing might
have been finally clinched in the course of
a few days. The action of that body,
alluded to in the enclosed slip, may be
sufficient to meet the contingency, although
it is quectionable whether they have the
power under the constitution (which is
similar to that of the United States) of
ratifying a treaty in advance. It 'vill be
an easy matter, however, to call the Sen
ate together, if deemed necessary.
The tariff bill was vetoed by the Presi
dent on the last day of the session, and
failed to pass by the constitutional major
ity, so that the tariff re-nains as it was.
An act was passed and approved by the
President, providing for the erection of a
court martial, to be composed of high mil
itary officers of .the country, to try Com.
Moore, which in effect recognizes him as
still in office, notwithstanding hisdismissal
by the President. 1 have not seen a list of
the acts passed. Very little, however, has
been done of general interest.
Yours, truly, J. B,
We give the extract from the Houston
Telegraph alluded to by our correspond
ent. It comes to us in- the shape of an
extract:
Glorious News-Annration.-We have
received intelligence from sources of un
questionable authority, that the Senate of
the United States has almost unanimously
ratified a treaty for the annexation of
Texas to the United States. - The des
patches relating to this subject have been
forwarded to our capital in all possible
haste in order that, if necessary, the Sen
ate may be convened to ratify the Treaty
on the part of Texas. This, however,
will not be necessary, for our Congress, in
secret session, has fully authorized the
President to ratify a treaty for this object
immediately. The news may ieem to be
too good to be true, but we have derived it
from letters written by intelligent gentle
men in the capital of the United States,
and we place full reliance in its authen
ticity. Gen. Murphy, who is here on his
way to Washington, does not deny it; but
his joyous smiles indicate too plainly that
he believes the day is close at hand, when
the youngest daughter of Republican
America will be restored to the arms of
the mother republic. Ere another harvest
is gathered in Texas, the broad banner of
Washington may be unfurled in glory on
our Western border, and the burnished
arms of American troops will be reflected
from the sparkling waters of the Nueces.
,,Westward! the star of empire take its
sway."
From the Houston Democrat we learn
that a report has renched that place, by
way of San Antonia, to the effect that the
Mexican villages along the Rio Grande
has heen recently illuminated, on account,
as is stated, of an armistic fur ten years
having bean agreed upon by the Commis
sioners of the two countries. We are not
prepared to credit, without better author
ity, the reports of the establishment of so
lug a ttuce ; hut, from the various reports
which reach us, all concurring in stating
that the suspension of hostilities for some
certain period has been agreed upon, we
are, led to believe that something of the
kind bas taken place. Ina the meantime,
nothing openly has transpired in Texas as
to the character of the last despatches re
ceived from the Commissioners.
The latest intelligence from San Anfio
ai~represents that a party of Mexican
robbers under Leal, have full sway tn that
vicinity at present, the few Americans
hardly daring to resist them. Cows are
wauouly killed, property stolen, and sev
eral notorious traitors openly defy the au
thorities. Their reign will be short, how
ever, as ,we learn from the Telegraph that
the gallant Col. H ays has been authorized
by Congress, to recruit a band for the pur
pose of protecting the frontier, and is now
busy collecting men and ammunition.
The Mexican bandits will not show them
selves east of' the Nueces when they find
that this officer is out again in force.
The "Vindicator," almost the only pa.
per in Texas which has leaned against an
nexation, contains the following sentence:
"On the subject of annexation, there is
but one opinion in Texas; we will not resist
the public will."
The cry of annexation is general from
one end of'the country to the other-the
editors are thinking-of nothing else, t alking
of nothing else. We are far from sanguine
that the news contained in the letter of our
correspondent and the extra from the Tel
egraph is true, although there is certainly
some little show of reason to believe that
there is more than mere speculation in it.
The general, the universal wish of Texas
appears to be to join with the U. States ;
if we cannot take them into the fold, why,
then they intimate that they will make the
otter to some other foreign government.
That this feeling is well known to out
statesmen at Washington City, there cau
he no doubt, and it may be that the ques.
tion has been agitated within doors, and
that measures have been taken favoring
the adoption of Texas into the confedera
cy. At present we can only say, that wvi
hope such may be the case, and in the
meantime shall anxiously await furthel
intelligence.

THE COTTON SPECULATIONS OF
i844AND1825.
There are twro remarkable eras. in tbe
history of the Cotron trade-that of 1825
and that of 1844. They are strikin~ly dif
ferent in many of their: characteristies.
The speculation of 1825' had its origin in
England-that of 1844 had its source in
the United States. That of 1825 was fos
tered exclusively by British capital-that
of 1844 is sustained as well by. Americana
as by British capital. In 1825 it was-the
abundance of money that stimulated.th
speculation in Great Britain. This was
the moving principle. Cotton felt the in
fluence in comm'on with all other con=
modities. In 1844 an expected deficioney
in the supply is the spur to excitement
and the plethora of money is a' collateral
effect. Can there be any generat deduc
tions drawn from this relative difference in %
the character and circumstances of. these
speculative eras'? We think the corn
parison affords some instruction.
1. The speculation of 1825 had its lim
iation as to time in the reaction that over
took all other commercial dealings.. Au
artificial excess of-paper nmoney mn Eng
land forced up the prices of alleommioda
ties. The boundary or limit to specula
tion was of course the ability of England
to keep the currency so full as to.be above
the level of the currencies of the cond.
nent. The termination of the speculatioa
and the reaction of prices was found there:
fore in the fact, that all factitious value,
having its origin in excessive issues of pa
per money, can' be sustaiaed no longer
than the excess is thrown back' bn the
country that originates and nurses.speca
lation by such excess.
2. The speculation of 1844 having its.
origin exclusively in an expected defi
ciency, the abundance of money being only
an incidental effect, its duration or limit
must be sought in some other circurstance
than a contraction of the currency from ar
tificial expansion.' The condition of the
money market is still an important el9
mnt in the question. 'But it .is. not a,
forced and a fictitious, but -a natural .ex
cess of money, that now -stimulates-aid.
sustains speculation on both sides.of the
Atlantic. It is a trial of ieal money
power between capitalitsdti :both theatres
of speculation. A real 'deficiency in the
supply, being the foundation of the excite
ment and not the artificial abundance, of
money, the .truggliA can only be doter.
mtned by the relative pecuniary ability of
the parties. A money-power that would
enable the specolators on this side of the
Alantic to keep the .coton market only'
sparingly supplied on the other side for
t wo months would triumph in this struggle.
But of this ability we have our apprehen
sions. Although the United States are
more independent of Enigland, in a pecu
niary sense-although there is less mer
catile indebtedness-than at almost any
other period of their commercial history
still the revival. of business-the large in
rease of British imports-the remit tances
for these itmports, and for dividends ott
State bonds-must daily lessen the ability
on this side to command funds, locked up
in Cotton retained at the ports of exporta
tion, as it increases the ability on the other
side to force its sale and shipment. Thea
inferences from these views afford lessonsa
of warning to those who have entered the
dangerous field of speculation, as to the
limit of time which they may have pre
scribed to themselves for continuing or
terminating their operations.
We ary serry to see a leading commter-'
cial paper in New York, the. Courier, &r
Enqurer, holding out hopes . that may
prove delusive, and encouraging specula
'ive movements that must he extremely
hazardous, in this stage of the struggle.
We contend that the advance which will,
in all probability, be realized in our mar.
kets, immediately after the advices of the'
4th February, will be sufficiently .large
to satisfy any rational desire to profit, anda.
having a reasonable proportiton to, any ear-.
pected deficiency. Any speculation-a
king in a larger range of time and deepec.
calculation of probabilities,, must mwiolve
risks too hazardous for the chance of gain..
