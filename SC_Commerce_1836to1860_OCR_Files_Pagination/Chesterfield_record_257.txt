FRIDAY EVENING. MAY IT. 1839.
The twosteamboats "North Carolina'' ant
? Vanderbilt," which run between Charlestor
and Wiimington, came in collision lately, while
running in opposite directions at night. Nc
iives were lost, but one of the boats was much
damaged. Particulars not published, so fa:
a9 we have seen. There was, doubtless, gros;
negligence somewhere. The owners of thc
boats have suspended both captains till ar
investigation can be had.
The statu of th?> weather on Saturday
morning prevented mast of those persons
at a distance who had expected to attendthe
meeting of the Pee D :c Agricultural
Society, from doing so. Ano aer meet,
ing will be held on Saturday the 221 ol
Ju:v. when persons who wish to avail tiiernselves
of the p:ivilego of uniting w ith the
Society, will luve c:i opportunity of doing
so.

The Presbyterian Church Case.?The Supreme
Court of Pensyhama, sitting in Dank
(i. e. as a court of appo ?ls) have granted a
now trial in this eas<\ taking ground very de?
ciJedly in favor of the Old School, or true Presbyterian
Church. It would, indeed, be a mos
strange perversion of law to do otherwise.?
When we received the "Opinion" of the cour!
we had no thought of giving it a place tn oui
columns but upon conversing en the s hjeel
with different persons of intelligence, and th.d
i?g them ignorant of tlie grounds on which tiic
lawsuit had been commenced, and desirous to
acquaint themselves wi ii it; and not doubting
that this was the case with others of our read
crs a!so, we changed our purpose and copied
the document on our fourth page. It sta.es
succinctly and clearly the grounds of the lawsuit.
The long continued drought in April and the
eary pirt of the present month h is destroyed
rainy of the inorus inulticaulis cuttings in this
neighborhood. So ne wore killed after two
or three leaves had opened, and others before
the sprout appeared above ground The cuttings
which were planted perpend'cularly suecceded
best; and or i h.s obvious reason, that
with the t'{ per end at a given distance under
the surface of the ground the lower end was
dc< per and, of course, in moister earth, than
if the cutting had been planted with an inclinati
m. We never could see any good reason
for the advice commonly given to plant with
an inclination, and never have followed it,
when wc used short cuttings.
Wo understand that the failure caused by
the drought extended as far south as Augusta,
and how much farther we know not.

Extraordinary Vegetables.?Our attention
was anracted last Saturday to fivt
Spears of Asparagus, produced by Air. Win,
Camrrrick, on tlie heights ot Gecrgetowi;
and exhibited at Ids vegetable s and in the
Centre Market. These extraordinary vvg.
cables were weighed by the imrket mas.
ter, and ascertained to amount to one pound
and a half. We never knew, in the course
of our lives, five spe trs of this delicious esculent
to weigh so much as tiiese; and wi
do not wonder tha' it was the opihion of ul
whom we conversed witii, that tlie like was
never before seen in the markets ot t its citv.
