next Presidential election, the prospects

and the probable fate of disting!ish?-d partv
leaders, and of political schemes either
<!< viscil or expected to be devised. These
party looking*, longings. hopes hiwI fears,
are not legitimate, bin they will be entertained
nevertheless. Congress has of late
years been in the habit of ''doing up" so
much pttlv business at Washington, t<>
the neglect of ib" public flairs, and to ilie
i ipiryof i lie c-? tin try's interests an I .,f publie

the d.dngs of llie sessim, very naturally
entertain those expectations g< nerated hy
a rem inbraorp of i!,e past. It is, however,
to hp li.p-d ih <t they o'ill lie disappointed.
The :ip;ir<iiieuing session is thai which
is usually tertifd "the short session," termi"n<ing
in ab nit ihree months irom its
commenee'nent. and being the last of ilr'e
present Congress. S!i ?rt as this same
session necessarily is, it has often occurred
to the mimls of many persons, thai
it i? always long enough to admit of the
perf irutance 'f as tnitcli useful work ;s is
usually accomplished at a long ses-imi.?
Of the truth of this conception there can
be b it little doubt, on the supposition, however.
tb it th" members should leave parly

XV ishingion, each an honest and lull purpose
of heart to attend faithfully to business?b'sjiliuiat"
business ami to spend
no more of tli public lime in its perforin
anre than what should he found absolutely
necessary. We would fain hope that they
will approach the metropolis in such
!?m of mind next December; and that
having met, thev will eschew all party and
personal quarrels President-making, slrife
and coiiietiliou, and redeem at once the
time and their character, f ?r the days are
somewhat evil, am! their reputation ought
to be precious to thetn. The most important
public business will not, we apprehend,
be found large in umount.
The first in importance is undoubtedly
that referred to bv Mr. Webster, in his
recent Faneuil Hall speech, viz: the Exchequer
plan prepared and agreed upon
by the President and his cabinet. This
plan, according to our general recollection
of it, so far as it regards the safe-keeping
of the public moneys, has some resemblance
to the sub-treasury system. Indeed,
while some of its opponents called
' - . 1 _ll
it the sut)-treasury in disguise, omers cawed
it a national bank in disguise, but as it
conld not be both, the inference seems
fair ihat it was neither, though it may
hav some of the features of each. At
any rate it has since the adjournment of
Congress, receive*! but little, if indeed
any notice, at the hand of either party,
and was not put in issue by either the
Whig, or the Democrats at any of the fall
elections hewl since. It seems to have
been, a? if t?y common consent, passed
over i;i silence by both parties; a circumstance
which would see o to indicate the
lion existence of any deep rooted hostility
towards it on the paal of either. Il
this inference be correct, it affords a
ground of hope that the subject will be
taken up prnmplh at the coming session,
and examined in nspirit of candor. About
the condition of our currency iliere is, we
believe, but little diff rence of opinion.?
it needs imnrovemeni sorely. Will this
plan effect that object? And if an honest
examination <?f j-s ptiuriples umJ pro visions
?jive an iiHirnialive answer, why not
then a lopt it/ It' it aff >rd in the nation a
sound currency based upon the public revenues,
anil give assurance for the safekeeping
of the public money, leaving the
Slate batiks free ami unrestricted, and
?:?eujiijf a saf" m* diurn ??f domestic exchanges,
why reject ii? Its constitutional!.
, tv, wp believe, his not been questioned
;it least, not that we rent mbcr. If adopt
(I, ihen it would need n<? censor nor require
any enlogisl. A fair trial would tes
its merits, and if found to work well it woulc
become p< pillar; if not, it would work oil
its own condemnation. As a nationa
bank is out of the question, it having become,
according to pretty good authoritli
"an obsolete idea"<kve ought to have as
good an ''idea" in its place as the collective
wisdom of the nation can devise.
Attempts will probably be made to repeal
the bankrupt law and the tariff art. The
former may perhaps succeed, but the sue
cess of the latter is to our mind raiher more
than doubtful. In fact neither of those
laws is of a kind* that ought to be treated
as a temporary enactment.. They so deeply
affect the business of the country and
the general morality, that they ought not
to be considered as intended merely to serve
an ocrassion, ami then to he thrown aside
until again wanted lor a similar purj nse.-Stich
legislation is special in its character,
and as mischievous as it is fluctuating, unsettling
the minds, the morals, and llm hojsiliCSS
of men, and deranging one year tin
calculations which it had encouraged them
in make the vear before. Would it no: he
better, then, to revise and an.em! if fo'.'ud
necessary, titan to nholi-h? Let them
work, and if found imperfect, repair then-;
lint do not break them into pieces, until
they prove either worthless or worse.
Several other matters will claim attention,
such as post ofli *e reform, itiiineroiisI
private claims long delay, d, <fcc &c. I * J
short the members will find business cnotiglt
to do, bill unite to* much if they approach
it in th" right spirit, and make a
summary disposal of?uc'i political or nth-1
er fir.-.brands as may be cast among them. J
Let litem work with a good will, and lltey
will lie al?le to retire from the set tie of their
labors next March with more of public up
probation than was b'*stoweil oil them at
the cb'se of the last session.

ENGLISH TORIES AND AMERICAN
WHIGS.
We find in an English caper, of ultra
liberal politics, and therefore hostile to
the Tory principles and parly, the followi.tg
candid tribute to the tendency of Sir
Robert Peel's administration towards a
liberal, economical policy. How humiliating
iiiat wiieii even tiiefory panjrindBngland
is ad\anring towards more just and
enlightened principles of government, the
Whig party in this free country should be
retrograding to the semi-barbarous policy
of monopoly and prohibitory protection:
4*If .Sir Robert Peel has not advanced
beyond the principles upon which, since
the reform hill, every Government in this
country must act, neither has he shown
any inrlainaiion to retrograde. His movement
in commercial policy his whatall the
disciples of free-trade principles conceive
to be in the right direction. Nay, more
than thai; let Whig cavillers say what they
will, it is the largest measure of fiscal re-,
form ever brought forward in this country.
? - - r _L!.f I
for rili'8 great customs reiorm was cmei-i
Iy administrative, reducing; to order a'
chaos of duties, and modes of levying
lhi-m; but Peel's tariff has embraced large
economical principles, (not yet carried out
to iheir full extent,) the abolition of prohibitions,
the approximation of the colonial
to the coasting trade, the abandonment
of trival or vexatious duties, and a
step towards the remission of duties, on
raw materials. Even his disagreeable income
tax?forced upon him by the wars
and mismanagement of his predecessors?
evinces the prudent statesman, who, wish-;
ing to improve the economical condition!
of the country, yet seeing its critical po*|
sition in relation to foieign powers, assures
to himself beforehand the possession
of adequate means to carry his inten

brave a passing odium. What Sir Hobert
Peel has done since he came inlo office is
fully more lhan we were entitled to expect
at his hands. Why should not the truth
be told/ And why, because we have ad
vocated measures with the Whigs, should
we expect to follow them in assailing men,
for party ends, an<J without regard to fair-1
ness, change of circumstances, public]
utility, or eventual gain to the measures'
themselves/"
From the New England Farmer.
The White Asii a remedy for Poison.
? In a communication in the New England
Farmer a few months ago, I endeav.
ored to call public attention to the While
Ash. Whether any person had been induced
to try experiments with it, I am not
informed, but I have extended my inquiries,
and obtained my important facts.
I lately conversed with a Baptist minister
who truvelsmuch in Virginia and North
i 'urnlina. He assured me that many peo
pie in these States well knew that the rattle
snakes an<l mocasin snakes have the
utmost dread of ihe White Ash, and tha'
it will cure those wit" are bitten by these,
snakes. He related many facts proving
thin persons had been cured when the effects
of the poison had rendered them help,
less, -0'hai others had to apply the remedy.
The bark or leaees is chewed nud
the juice swallowed, and also applied lo
ihe wound; or if there is time, a tea may
he made of the harU or leaves and drank
freely, and also used externally.
I have obtained other proofs of its efficacy
in curing the bite of serpents, and of
its preventing their biting. 1 am now con*
fident that inany in all parts nf our conn*
try have some knowledge of its virtues;
and it seems surprising that they have not
been more regarded by our physicians.?
In several medical works the subject is
mentioned; but 1 have found no physician
or botanist who has devoted much alien*
lion to it. One in Lowell and one in Boston
have promised to prepare medicines
from the White Ash, and to use them when
they have an opportunity.
I have recently had a case of poison
from ivy. I took a little branch of this
valuable tree, and cut up wood, bark, and
leaves into small pieces, and poured half
a pint of hot water upon them, anJsoon
made a hot tea. I caused the patient (o
drink about a wine glass full of this lea,
and to bathe the poisoned limbs. The
cure was nearly complete; but the dose
ought to have been repeated after an hour
or less. I am satisfied that we can, by this
mode, control this species of poison; but I
am not able to say, how it would effect
cases of poison from dogwood.
In this and my former communications
I have been careful to avoid expressing
more confidence in the virtues of the White
Ash, than the facts which have been collected
will justify. And,- even, if I have
erred in any case, I see not that any can
be injured by such experiments as will
lead 10 the whole truth. I have never
heard that any lad qualities belonged to
this tree. I have often swallowed the juice1
of its leaves and bark after chewing them,
and no unpleasant effects have resulted.?
Suit against Nicholas Biddle.?The
assignees of the Bank of the United States
have filed a bill of discovery, in the nature
of an equity proceeding, in the District
Court, against Nicholas Biddle, Esq., asking
that he may be called uport to answer,
under oath, how and for what purposes he
expended large sums of money belonging
to the late Bank, obtained by hiro, upon.
i 1 I
certain ctiecKs, liCKeis, receipts biiu uruers
passed between him and John Andrew*.
First Assistant Cashier of the Bank. The
sums which the plaintiffs say Mr. Biddle
lhiie draw from the Bank amount* to 396,OOO,
the whole of which, they say, was ap.1
plied to unlawful purposes, and to promote
Mr. Riddle's own private view3.
They also state that these sums were
drawn from the Bank without any authority,
and by collusion between the defendant
and Mr, Andrews. The tickets, orders,
&,c., are set forth in the bill, and are the
same as those exhibited before the Recorder
when Mr. Biddle was under examination
with others, on a charge of conspiracy
to defraud the Bank. On Monday, the
trustees of the Bank commenced an action
against Thomas Duiilap, but have not yet
filed a claim in that case.
Philadelphia Ledger.
Singular Affair.?Mr. Eugene Clifford
who resided at Fairfield, Vt., has
been arrested for the supposed murder of
his wife and child under very unusual cirmmtianrps.
It annears that on the 16lh
*ilt. he requested his wife to accompany
him on a visit to a friend on the opposite
side of the pond, asserting at the same
time, (what is reported not to be true,) that
they had been specially invited so to do.
The day was rather cold and unpleasant,
and Mrs C. made many objections, but at
the urgent solicitations of her husband,
she finally consented, and taking an infant
child, they left home, and in crossing the
water the boat was upset and the mother
and child were drowned, while the husband
artd lather escaped. Clifford's story
! is, that in consequence of a strong wind,
that his wife and child fell into the water
and drowned; and that in trying to recover
them, he also fell in, and in falling upset
the boat. The bodies were found on thn
same day, and the following day a coroner's
inquest was held, and a verdict given
i of "accidentally drowned." Some suspicious
circumstances coming to light a
I second inquest was called nn I nursaay,
and a verdict given of "wilful murder."
C. was accordingly arrested, and a court
of examination held, which resulted in his
committal to jail for further trial.
An Illinois Wedding.?"Will you
take this woman to be your wedded wife/"
said a magistrate who was placing the indissoluble
knot of matrimony on a couple
mutually attached to one another, in Illinois.
"Well, I swar, squire," said the malo
partner to the contract?a wolfish looking
customer, by the way?"Well, I swar,
squire," you must be a green one to ask
such a question ns that ar. Do you think
I'd be such a plaguey fool, old feller, as
lose the sport of the bar hunt, and take
this gal off from the quilting frolic, if I
was'nt conscriptimisly sartin and determined
to hitch on h? r? Prire on now with
the business, squire, and ask me no more
suchdarn'd foolish questions as that."
