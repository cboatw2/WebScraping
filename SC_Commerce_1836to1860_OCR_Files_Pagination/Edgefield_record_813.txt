WINTER IS H ERE.
- l....LIZA -COOK.
Winter is here, the old robin has come
To remind us.with tip-tapping bill,
That his mot nng repast of thedelicate crumb
Should be spread for him now on the sill.
Thou shalt have it, all saucy and rude as thou
art,
Strutting up in thy warrior red:
I adore thy sweet note, and I love thy bold heart,
So come here, pretty Bob, and be fed.
Winter-is here, for the dove-cago i , found
Taken down from the vine.covered wall;
The rough-coated spaniel and favorite bound
Sneak into the tire-lighted hall.
The door that wes flinging wide open of late
Till-night sent her heralding star,
Where the porch trellis bent, and the eglan
tine's weight,
'Tis now fast with the bolt and the bar.
Winter is here, the gay hearth ia tindrest,
All stript of its wreuthings of green ;
The cricketonce more whistlesont from its nest,
And the bm ight snapping wood-blaze is seen.
We circle that blaze when the morning's dark
frown
Lingers long on the mist-covcred pane;
A few hours roll over, the dim sun goes down,
And we meet by that warm blaze again.
Winter is here. all the flowers are dead;
No posey ia gracing trh room
But corals and near!. of rare lustre are spread
In the holly and mtist!etoe bloonm.
Tht herds a:c bronght in from the verdurelk se
hills
To their coverts for shelter and food ;
Thm trout nestle deep in the rush-bordering rills,
The rooks have come back to their wood.
Winter is here. the old tottering man,
Closely iutlled, goes shivering forth ;
The bareheaded urchins laugh loud as he can,
With their glowing cheeks turned to the
north.
The sent 'neath the beeches is tenantless now.
Ther^'s no loitering form in the shade;
But the dance gives a warmth and a flush to
the brow,
While the quickest ofjig tunes is played.
Winte" s ' ere,let us welcome him on,
Ret. . . ar old Christmas is near ;
And when Christmas with all his gay feasting
tas gomne,
Why then we've the merry new rear.
lieu e's a health to- the rich who will give to thme
peer,
Let plenty amid mercy ne'er part;
And though bitter winds blow throug'h the,
white cloumis of snow,
No witntershall fall on thme heart.
Enjoyment .-When 1 walk ihe streets,
I use the following natural maxim, viz:
that he is the true possessor of a thing
whoenjoys it, and not hec thar owtns it
without the enjoy ment of in. 't'0 convinice
myself that I hare a property in-the gay
part -of all the-guilt chariots that I meet,
which I regard as atnemnents designed
to delight my eyes, and the itnagination
of those kind people whoe sit in them ant
tired only to please me. I have a real, and
they only ani imnagiuntey pleasure from
their interitor, emhellishments. Upon the
same principle, I have discovered that I
um the p~roi:ietor of all thte necklaces, the
crosses, stars, brooches, amnd embroidered
cloth, which I see at a play or a birth
night as giving anorec natural delight to the
spectator than to those that wear them.
And 1 look 'on the beauxa nd ladies as so
many paraqutets in .an aviary, tulips in a
gardeu, designed purely for 'my diveision.

(BY- REQUEsT. J
.. From the: Hanbug Journal.
ir. Edito-- It/desire with your per
mission, to make through the columns of
your paper some remarks on a subject,
that ray-find its way among the records
of history4 and were I master of.-tbe Jan
guage, and could handle the goose quill as
well as I *cah a jack-plane, or a sledge
hammer,'I w Id make a rue and interest
ing-picture of; the case. But' as it is, I
must contentmyself with rnaking such as
my narrow littlits will dictate.
That nototious'Bridge Case is in ques
tion, viz.--"John W. Yarborough, Trus
tee, and -Henry Shultz, vs. The Bank of
the State of Georgia ; the City Council of
Augusta, and G. B. Lamar." I have,
since the Decree it) the case has been pro
nounced by the Cbhancellor, and confirmed
by-the Court of Appeals in this State,
seen, in several public journals, expression
of hope that tiiis'discussion might finally
and forever setle this questiou. Thu
Chancellor -thought proper to make simi
lar remarks inbis Decree; and I flattered
myself with the hope, that such might be
the event. But'the result has provet ott
-rwise.
The Case has tO go back to the United
States Court, where it originated, and
where it nevei has been finally settled, and
for whidi rinidtval, prepsarations are now:
in progress, atit.in which'.Court I am glad
to say, the-case -will be beyond the - influ
ence of sectional- prejudices-beyond the
influence of Banks, and beyoud the influ
ence of Town Corporations, and where the
facts, and the law alone will prevail.
It1as been rifyfate to be in law these
twety-twoyeat,.fdid it may be my rate
to die in law. - fe it so! Now, sir, let us
look at the "danide! -Atm I attempting to
take the labor apjd the property of my fel
low men ? No, -ot so ! They are at
tempting to take my labor and my prop
erty, without money and without price;
and - am endeqvoring to resist their eruel
intentions: F ift F had built no Bridge
und .no Townthere ' would have been no
contest for-.u Bidge,-and fir a Town, and
I would tot have been -in law, nor in tor
tent these seriosof years. What are the
facts? - Thero-came a man. -from beyond
tbeseas, with:talent; with spirit, and with
perseverance;: a" -accomplished an en
terprise which natives after two unstccess
ful attempt, hakabandoned as impracti
cabl'-ttie diifohtillir-defea''bear- wit
ness to the present day.- A Bridge ! a
structure thatgrapples two powerful States
A Bridge ! that bids defiance to mighty
floods. A Bridge !-a highway over a re
bellious stream, for man and 'for beast by
day and by night. Even when the face of
the earth is submerged by floods, you find
a safe passage from one State into an
other. And can there be a man with com
mon sense, living, who would from his
h.eart say, that i should ever surrender this
structure, with thaetorinous sum of $684,
0)00.00. to the power or chicanery of man
kind uniustly, or that I am not deserving
to enjoy the neitefits of its fruits myself?
No! I do not believe that there is; and
vere I to say otherwise, I feel that I
would do injustice to the human race.
There are many, very many, who ap
preciate this structure very highly, with a
hearty desire to be masters, or the owners
of it. And is it not natural-does not crm
mon sense say, that a father loves his child
better, and appreciates its qualities higher
than a stranger?- 1 do not crave one dol
lar more than what is my own. lily own,
and nothing but my own do I want; and
for that I shall contend during my natural
life, if I do not obtain it before; and after
that, I hope that others will proceed witb
it, for which purpose,- prompt arrange
meats are tmadev so that nor even my "long
hoped for death," will benefi those perse
etntors. I prefer that -part or this money
shoutld go to finish the Monroe Rail Roadi,
thatn for those u~surpers to keep it.
There is one paragraph in. the Chancol
for's Decree to.which I request at tention,
it is as followse :-"Then as to any right
of- the Complainant in the Bridge. itself, it
would he sufficient to say, that all the
Comoplaitnaut Shtultz's right and interest
therein has passed away by the expiration
of his Charter. The franchise or emclusive
privilege wvhich c'onstito'ted if hi's property;,
no lunger exists, and the material struoture
is attached to, and part of the soil, antd
wouild be the property of the States, the
owners of the soil, if the franchise had nut
been tenewed to another."
This is confiscating' a citizen's property.
It gives our Bridge after the eftpiration of
Charter, to the State, without tmoney and
withottt price. True, the franchise be
longed to the State, anmd the-State may,
after the expiration of our Charter, give it
to atnother person; but can the. Stare take
our Bridge and give-it away too? Sup.
pose it to be a ferry ! The State may
grant the franchise to another, but can the
ferry-hboat be taken nnd'given away also by
the Stare? According 'to this principle
every Rail Road, -and every Batnking
hmouse wtould, after fte expiration of rt-eir
charters, be the property- of the State
Sny~t hey bought t he premises, upon which
they build--and so did we, for wye paid to
:he formter proprietors of the ferry,.S8500
for the laud on wvhich the Bridge stands,
and the ferry right: and then we paid 873,
000 for the builditng of the Bridge, and af
ter twenty-one. years uli belong to thes
.State! and besidei which,.we, biit .th
Bridge udder the a uthority of the State at
our dwn. expenas and Iabor--th' Site
never paid one dollsrjif'rhe~building of it;
'Th'e Chancellor EiI Aivb mfecredit foi
my acts, if he could not giye me my btidge
I ays ---"On the 24th-of )Ina.: 18191
the Bridge. Company stopped. payment.
Upon beitig apprized of this, the Com
plainant Shultz,- who had .made arrange
ments for going to Europe,. returned. and
resumed his place in the.firm.. The evi
'dence is, that Shultz advanced $15,000 of
his own funds to pay the deposites in the
Bask." This was the act of an honest
man: it was the ait of a friend in time of
need.. Few! yes, very, few, would have
.performed this- act. They would have
kept their $120,000 in their pockets and
-set sail for Europe, instead of returning to
Augusta and paying their money for a
friend. . .
The Chancellor further says:-The
Complainant Shultz is naturally disposed
to think, that he must have suffered injus
tice, from having been deprived of prop
erty that was not only a matter of interest,
but of pride and feeling; and from haying
been harassed and. pursued on account.of
his responsibility for. a Compauy,.io the
failure of which he, as I am fully satisfied,
did not at all contribute; but I believe be
is inclined to shift the blame from those
to whom it properly belonged, on account
of somie recollection of early kindness (an
act of gratitude ?) .and throw it on others
who bave dune nothing more than to stand
upon what they fairly regard as their just
rights." Yes Sir! they shall have their
money .n ith interest, but they shall not
have my Bridge.
- line, the Chancellor admits, that.iae
ted the part of an honest man.. He ad
mits that I acted the part of a friend in
time of need; and hq also admits, that I
acted the grateful 'man. These are con
cessions.of.the- highest-virtue. tbat.man
kind can .be posaessed- of,. and which are
.appreciated by me higher than all your
robes.and your gold.
