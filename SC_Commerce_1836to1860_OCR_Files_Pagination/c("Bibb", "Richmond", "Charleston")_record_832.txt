CHRIST SUPERIOR TO THE WORLD.
Ah, why this disconsolate frame 1
Though earthly enjoyments decay,
My Jesus is ever the same,
A Sun in the gloomiest day.
Though molten awhile in the fire,
Tis only the gold to refine; j
And be it my fervent desire,
Though suffering, not to repine.
What can be the pleasure to me X
Which earth at its zenith can boast 1 '
Delusive its vanities flee,
A flash of enjoyment at most:
And if the Redeemer could part.
For me, with his crown in the Aies,
Ah, why is so dear to my heart,
What he in his wisdom denies 1

True, riches to others are given,
In mirth and in revelry drown’d,
But while I have treasures in heaven,
Where should my affections be found 1
Why, chained to this hillock of clay,
My Zionward journey forget I
Why envy the carnally gay,
Who dance on the brink of the pit 1
Dear Jesus I my feelings refine,
My truant affections recall;
Then be there no fruit in the vine,
Deserted and empty the stall;
The olive shall wither and die,
The field shall no harvest afford;
But under the gloomiest sky,
My soul shall rejoice in the Lord!
Then let the rude tempest assail,
The blast of adversity blow;
The haven (though distant) I’ll hail,
Beyond this rough ocean of woe.
When safe on its beautiful strand,
I’ll smile at the billows that foam;
Kind angels to hail me to land,
And Jesus, to welcome me home.

OBITUARY
" Blessed art the dead who die in the Lord."
For the Southern Christian Advocate.
Died, in the faith, on the evening of the 25th of
March, 1844, Miss Abigail Conyers, daughter of
Mr. Daniel Conyers, aged twenty years, two
months and one day.
Sister Conyers was awakened, converted, and
joined the Methodist E. Church, at Thomasville
camp-ground, Thomas county, Ga., in the year
1839, of which she lived and died a consistent
member.
She had been afflicted with a cough for about one
year, and took a violent cold which so deranged the
system, and complicated the disease, that death
quickly and unexpectedly ensued.
In her affliction she repined not; but possessed
her soul in patience and Christian fortitude—show
ing resignation to the will of God. She could tes
tify in the class-room, when asked of her spiritual
state, that she enjoyed the comforts of religion; and
on the day of her death she spoke of heaven in
soul-soothing words, as “ Sweet home,”—and
“ Glory.” And when asked why she so repeatedly
spoke such words, she replied, “ Because it was
the engagement of her thoughts.” Although her
death was not thought to be so near, either by her
self or the family, yet she had a foretaste of the
rest into which she was soon to enter, which was
expressed in the following words,
“ When we’ve been there ten thousand years,
- Bright shining as the sun:
We’vo no less days to sing God’s praise,
Than when we first begun.”
When the moment of her exit came, with closed
eyes, she sweetly breathed her last, without a sigh
or struggle,—insomuch, that it was thought she
never felt the sting of death. So she is gone to
realize her reward, while her relatives mourn their ,
loss, which, doubtless, is her eternal gain.

Died, on the 16th inst., at the residence of Mr.
William Jourdons, in St. Peter’s Parish, Mrs. Sa
bah C. Daley, in the twenty-fourth year of her
age.
The disease which terminated her mortal career
was consumption. Though lingering under this ;
fatal disease for twelve or fourteen months, she
bore her affliction with Christian fortitude and pa
tience. About the year 1836, she connected her
self with the Methodist E. Church, of which she
continued an exemplary member until she exchan
ged the church militant for the church triumphant.
In the morning of the day on which she died, she
was asked by a friend if she saw her way clear, to
which she replied that she did not. They then uni
ted in prayer, and afterwards she appeared perfectly
resigned, and said,—“All doubts were dispersed;”
and repeated the following verse :—
“ Jesus can make a dying bed,
Feel soft as downy pillows are;
W hile on his breast 1 lean my head,
And breathe my life out sweetly there.”
She then requested her husband to meet 4ier in
heaven, and expired.
As a wife, she was affectionate; as a parent,
kind and endearing. She has left a husband and
three small children, with a large circle of relatives
and friends to mourn their irreparable loss.

Died, on the 6th inst., in Moore county, N. C.,
Lewis Philifs, in the eighty-eighth year of his
age. Father Philips has been an exemplary mem
ber of the Methodist E. Church for the last twen
ty-seven years. His zeal in the cause of Christ
was truly praiseworthy. His unwearied diligence
“ In the patience of hope,
And labour of love,”
secured to him the appellation of “ The old regu
lar.” He resolved, as one of old, that “ he and
his house” would serve the Lord; and carrying
out this noble resolve, he was blessed with a pious
family, and met a triumphant death.
He suffered extremely with an attack of bilious
pleurisy; but was enabled to suffer with patience
and resignation. His children being convinced a
short time before his departure, he said to them,
“ My children, I shall soon leave you.” To one of
them he said, “ My confidence is strong,_there is
not a doubt upon my mind.” And when exhorted
by a faithful mother in Israel,—now ninety-three
years old,—to maintain his confidence in God, he
replied, “ 1 feel the work of the Lord reviving in
ray soul,—glory to God for supporting grace 1“
every hour.” And with thia exclamation, he left
the world in prospect of a glorious rest in heaven.

Died, on the 12th ulfc, in Thomas county, Ga.,
Mrs. Sarah J. Reeves, in the twenty-seventh
year of her age.
Sister Reeves embraced religion at a protracted
meeting in Thomasville in 1839, and attached her
self to the Methodist E. Church, in which she lived
a consistent member until her death. Her disease
was typhus fever, of five weeks duration, in which
time she suffered much; but in her sorest suffer,
ings, she was patient, cheerful and happy.
As her end drew near, she seemed fully to ap
prehend it, and would converse deliberately on the
subject, constantly expressing her entire confidence
in God, and assurance of a better home in Heaven.
She seemed to anticipate her employment in
Heaven by desiring her friends to join her in sing
ing the songs of Zion. She commenced singing,
“ My span of life will soon be done,”
and some verses alone, clearly and in her perfect
senses.
Just before her departure, she took her infant
and pronounced her blessing upon it, with tiic rest
of her children and husband, committing them all
to the care of that God that had cared for tier, and
charged them all to meet her in heaven. This done,
she sweetly fell asleep in Jesus.
Sister Reeves has left a bereaved husband, six
little children, and many other relatives and friends,
who feel their loss sorely; but rejoice to know
that their loss is her gain.

Died, on the 31st March, 1844, Mrs. Cassandra
Benton, in the thirty-fifth year of her age. She
was the wife of John Benton, Esq., and the daugh
ter of Samuel and Sarah Coleman. Sister B. ob
tained religion about 1834, and attached herself to
the Methodist E. Church, of which she lived an
humble and faithful member until the day of her
death. She was afflicted with a cancer on the
breast, and suffered much with that loathsome dis
ease ; but was enabled to bear her affliction with
Christian fortitude for some months, and was often
heard to say, “ I am ready to go.” I asked her, a
short time before her death, about her prospects,
and, said she, “ I have been long ready to die,”—
She conversed with other friends at several' other
times, and assured them that Heaven would be her
home. She has left a kind husband, relatives and
a number of friends to lament their loss. But they
sorrow not as those who have no hope. “ Let me
die the death of the righteous, and let my last end
be like his.” Noah Smith.

Died, on the 17th inst., John C. Kennerly, aged
seventy-two years one month and twenty-three
days.
Father Kennerly was, for more than thirty years
a member of the Methodist E. Church. The writer
of this notice lived in the house of the deceased for
fifteen years, and cannot recollect ever to have
heard him speak an unguarded word, or to have
knowft him do an improper deed. He was a pat
tern of piety,—faithful in ail things. When death
came, he was ready to depart and be with Jesus.—
Seeing his wife much affected, he said to her, “ If
it is God’s will that I should die, it is the best time
for me to go only try to meet me in heaven.—
My way is clear.” As he lived, so he died,—in
perfect peace with God and man. lie has left an
aged widow and many friends to mourn their loss.

THE EARLY HISTORY OF CHINA—FIRST
EUROPEAN INTERCOURSE.
It was not long after the passage of the Cape
of Good Hope by De Gama, that the Portu
guese, in 1516, first arrived in Canton. They
appear to have early made unfavorable impres
sion upon the minds of the Chinese, who were
soon disgusted by their grasping avarice. They
were afterwards still more unfavorably regarded
when they came to be competitors with the
Dutch and the English. The hostility of the
people of different nations, but who appeared to
the Chinese to be all alike, naturally created in
the minds of the latter a jealousy of men so dis
trustful of each other, and who were in constant
hostilities one with another. Their conduct was
the more marked, from the contrast which it ex
hibited with the peaceable deportment of their
predecessors, the Arabs.
The first places of resort to the Portuguese
were the islands at the mouth of the Canton
river. The vessel despatched by Alfonzo Albu
querque, the Captain-general of Malacca, reach
ed one of these, under the command of Peres
trello, and, as his voyage proved very successful,
it had the effect of engaging others in similar
enterprises. Being distinguished as the first per
son who ever conducted a ship to China under
a European flag, he was followed in the ensu
ing year by a fleet of eight vessels, under the
command of Perez de Andrade, who, on reach
lnff th® coast, was surrounded by junks of war,
and his movements watched with suspicion. He
was, however, permitted to proceed with two of
his vessels to Canton; and, while successfully
negotiating for a trade, received accounts that the
remainder of his fleet had been attacked by pi
rates. Some of his vessels returned with cargoes
to Malacca ; the remainder sailed in company
with some junks, belonging to the Loochoo Is
lands, for the province of Foidien on the east
coast, and succeeded in establishing a colony at
Ningpo. The Portuguese subsequently brought
their families to that port, carrying on a gainful
trade with other parts of China, as well as with
Japan. But in the year 1545 the provincial
government, provoked by their ill conduct, ex
pelled them from the place; and thus was forev
er lost to them an establishment on the continent
ofChinainone of the provinces of the empire
best adapted to the ends of European trade.
The general behavior of the Portuguese had,
from the first, been calculated to obliterate the
kvorable impression which the Chinese had re
ceived from the justice and moderation of Perez
le Andrade. Only shortly after his visit, a
squadron, under the orders of his brother Simon,
was engaged in open hostilities, having establish
ed a colony at San Shan, near Macao, (vulgarly
called St. John’s,) and erected a fort there: they
were finally defeated by a Chinese naval force,
but continued to commit acts of piracy on the
trading vessels. Subsequently to this career of
violence, and during the more recent periods of
their connexion with China at Macao, the Por
tuguese appear, on the other hand, to have enter
tained too extreme an apprehension of giving
umbrage to the native government; and while
they imagined they were securing favor to them
selves, their conduct has often served to encour
age Chinese encroachment.
The first Portuguese embassy, and one of the
first from any European power by sea, to Peking,
took place as early as 1520, in the person of
Thomas Pirez, the object being to establish a
factory at Canton, as well as Macao. Advices,
however, had preceded him of the ill conduct I
and violence of Simeon de Andrade; and, after
a course of humiliation, the unfortunate Pirez
was sent back under custody to Canton, the pro
vincial government of which place thus early
showed its jealousy of any attempt on the part of
strangers to communicate with the court. Pirez,
on his arrival, was robbed of his property,
thrown into prison, and ultimately, it is supposed,
put to death. The various embassies, which
nave since followed in three successive centuries,
to Peking, have met with different kinds of treat
ment;—but, in whatever spirit conducted, they
have oeen equally unsuccessful in the attainment
of any important points of negotiation.
In the following year Alfonso de Melo arriv
ed in China, ignorant of the events which had
taken place, and having altogether six vessels
under his command. “ These,” a Portuguese
writer observes, “ sent on shore for water, but
returned with blood.” They became immedi
ately involved in conflicts with the Chinese,
who put to death upwards of twenty prisoners
that fell into their hands; and the squadron
shortly afterwards sailed away from China.
Previous to the arrival of Europeans on its
shores, the government of the country gave eve
ry encouragement to foreign commerce, and at
a very early period Chinese junks proceeded to
the coasts of the peninsula of India. Statistical
records exist to the present day, having refer
ence to foreign intercourse, which display a per
fect knowledge of the advantages of trade, and
form a striking contrast to the indifference which
thfi nTPSPflt T'nrtfir frnuprnmnnf nfTn/»fa fn fnnl tn.
wards it. Subsequent to a temporary prohibition
of foreign trade, a certain Fooyuen of Canton
thus addressed the Emperor:—“ A great part
of the necessary expenses of both the govern
ment and the people of Canton is supplied by
the customs levied on merchants; and ii foreign
ships do not come, both public and private con
cerns are thrown into much embarrassment and
distress. It is entreated, therefore, that the Franks
be permitted to trade. Three or four advantages
result therefrom. In the first place, besides the
regular tribute of the several foreign States, a
small per centage has been taken from the re
mainder, adequate to the supply of the provincial
expenditure. Secondly, the treasury appropria
ted for the annual supply of the army in Canton
and (iuong-sy is entirely drained, and our de
pendence is on trade to provide against exigen
cies. Thirdly, the contiguous province has
looked to Canton for supplies, being unable to
comply with any demands made on it; but when
foreign ships have free intercourse, then high
and low are all mutually supplied. Fourthly,
the people live by commerce. A man holding
a quantity of goods sells them, and procures
what himself requires: thus things pass from
hand to hand, and, in their course, supply men
with food and raiment. The government is
thereby assisted, the people enriched, and both
have means aflorded them on which they may
depend.” Admissions of a similar nature, and
of a very late date, contained in addresses from
the provincial government to Peking, have
proved that the Chinese authorities are by no
means unmindful of the revenues derived from
the European trade.
It was about the middle of the sixteenth cen
tury that the Portuguese established themselves
at Macao, the only European colony that, with
very limited success, has been planted on the
coast of China : it seems that they had tempora
ry shelter on the shore as early as 1537. By
bribery and solicitation, leave was obtained for
erecting sheds to dry goods, which were intro
duced under the name of tribute. The foreign
ers were by degrees permitted to build substan
tial houses, and the petty mandarins connived at
an increasing population, the establishment of
an internal government, and the influx of priests
with their endeavors to convert the Chinese. In
1573 the Chinese erected a barrier-wall across
the isthmus, which separates Macoa from the
island of Heang-shan. A civil mandarin was
very early apointed to reside within the town,
and govern it in the name of the Emperor of
China This officer, called a Tso-tang keeps a
watchful eye on the inhabitants, and communi
cates information to his superiors. The Portu
guese are not allowed to build new churches or
houses without a license. The only privilege
they possess is that of governing themselves;
while the Chinese population of the town is en
tirely under the control of the mandarins. The
Spaniards, indiscriminately with the Portuguese,
have the right of trading to Macao; but the
number of shipping was, in 1725, by an order
from the Emperor, restricted to 22, and it is, ac
tually not much more than half that number.
The last Emperor of the last Chinese dynasty
sent to Macao for some guns, and a small mili
tary force, against the Manchow Tartars; but
in 1651 the inhabitants of that colony were en
rolled as the subjects of the present Ta-tsing
family.
It seems needless to notice the several fruitless
embassies which the Portuguese, since their
earlier resort to China, have sent to Peking, and
the last of which occurred in 1753. They ex
hibit the usual spectacle of arrogance on the one
side, and profitless submission on the other. J
SCIENTIFIC APPARATUS.
The apparatus for schools and families, de
vised and prepared by Mr. Josiah Holbrook, (
several years since, ana extensively used in this j
and other countries, has recently been much im
proved. As it brings largely into exercise the
eye and hand, in aid of the mind, in understand
ing some of the most important laws and works
of our Creator, it is fitted for human beings,
wherever they exist, without regard to country,
nation, or language. It also aids in collecting
and preparing specimens of nature and art, such j
as cabinets oi geology, albums, or books of il
lustrations in geometry, maps and other draw
ings for geography, and thus produces instru
ments for diffusing knowledge to others, while
it impresses thoroughly, because practically, up
on the minds of those who use it in aid of such
collections.
The following are some of its specific uses:—
First.—It employs, entertains, and instructs
children, before they understand, or are able to
comprehend, the arbitrary signs of knowledge
in books. '■
Second.—It changes the long, irksome pro
cess of teaching children to read, write, and spell
into agreeable, instructive exercises, and thus
makes better readers, writers, and spellers, in far
less time. In Prussian schools, after a course
of lessons directly from objects, similar to this
apparatus, one week is a common time for the
pupils to learn to read simple sentences.
Third.—It gives correct and clear first im
pressions, and thus avoids the laborious, painful
task of unlearning error, and greatly lessens the
evil of forgetting instructions after many repeti
tions.
Fourth.—It increases a love of learning, of
books, and of school; and hence cures truants,
promotes assiduity, and good order of pupils, by
rendering them happy in being useful, both at
home and at school.
Fifth.—By cabinets of nature and art, made
in families and schools, in different towns, states,
and countries, “Scientific Exchanges’’ may
be widely extended among nations; and thus
national prejudices allayed, their reciprocal re
lations and mutual good will increased, and by
them, the liabilities to war, and the consequent
expenses for national defence diminished.
Sixth.—By a taste thus promoted for the
pleasures of science, and with a conscious dig
nity from diffusing those pleasures and blessings
widely among nations, a security, neaily ceitain,
is provided against low and degrading pleasures,
now ruining thousands, and threatening our
liberties and our republic.
Seventh.—As the apparatus furnishes practi
cal lessons about the earth and its productions, it
follows the example of the “ first lesson” in the
volume of inspiration given by Moses, and car
ried out by David, Isaiah, St. Paul, and most of
all by Him who spoke as never man spoke, and
taught as never man taught.
Eighth.—By engaging young minds in stu
dying and young hands in collecting, arranging
and exchanging the productions and common
bounties of our Creator, their attention is natu
rally led to the two great commands of the moral
law,—love to God, and love to our neighbor.
The apparatus consists of a globe, maps, geo
logical cabinet, geometrical diagrams, and sol
ids, with several instruments, designed especially
for the hand, and a manual of explanations and
questions for the whole: safely packed in a box
fitted for transportation to any distance. Price

THE RICH MAN’S GRAVE.
We stood not long since by the grave of one
whose long life had been laboriously spent in
acquiring wealth. His industry, and rigid eco
nomy, had resulted, as they almost uniformly do,
in success. But though excellent in themselves,
industry and economy may be abused; and it
was so in the present instance. The industry of
the man we refer to, was a voluntary ensiaving
of himself to the pursuit of gain. His mind
was so entirely centered upon this one object,
that he allowed himself no time for improve
ment, either moral or intellectual. He never
sought admission into refined and cultivated so
ciety, and allowed himself to remain profoundly
ignorant of almost every thing not calculated in
some way to promote his pecuniary interest.—
His economy was carried to an equal excess
years he saw his possessions extending on every
hand, he allowed himself no indulgence in the
reasonable and temperate elegancies of life.—
His dwelling, as well as his personal appear
ance, and all his domestic appurtenances, denoted
poverty instead of competence and wealth. He
esteemed money better than wife, or children, or
friends, and his shabby home was therefore never
enlivened by the affection of those whom kind
ness, and nature, would have taught to love him.
It is hardly necessary to say that no public spirit
could dwell in the heart of such a man. He had
nothing to spare for any object of public utility,
and was never known to dry up the tears of the
orphan. By a steady pursuit of a course of this
kind, he amassed his tens of thousands, and
when he had filled up something more than half
a century, he “died and was buried.” His large
estate was meted out among heirs whom he had
hardly permitted to respect him while living,
and who could not be expected to grieve with
much intensity when he was gone. This we
thought might perhaps account for the appear
ance of the rich man’s grave. It was in a very
small enclosure, though large enough to admit
of the marble column that gratitude or affection
might desire to place there. But no marble col
umn was there, nor any sculptured table, nor !
even the still less imposing plain stone. A con- j
pie of coarse fragments of rock, without even the
! initials of the deceased upon them, denoted that I
| a grave was there. Not a shrub or flower had
been planted, nor even a mound raised, but coarse
and decaying weeds covered the damp ground.
And this was the end of the rich man!
It may have been painful, but we thought as
we looked upon that unattractive spot, that it was
eloquent in instruction, that those “thatare rich
in this world” would do well to heed. What
comfort can riches now afford the slumberer in
that dark and cheerless bed ? Nay, what com
fort did they afford him in life? What, besides
the sordid gratification of conscious possession ?
And if it be said that this is an extreme case, and
that all rich men are not misers, the question
may be asked with equal propriety where wealth
is used merely for purposes of luxury or dis
play. When lavished to gratify “the lust of the
flesh or the lust of the eye, or the pride of life,”
equally as when hoarded in the coffers of the
miser, riches canker, and the rust thereof shall
eat like fire into the soul of the unfaithful stew
ard. The man who makes it his governing
purpose to be rich can ordinarily succeed, but if
he expects to find true happiness in such a course,
he is wofully mistuken. Mental disappointment
will meet him at every step, and the prime of
existence spent upon idols, will only insure a
blank and cheerless old age, and a dismal eter
nity.—Protestant and Herald.
Though in the course of
YOUTH.
AN AFFECTING INCIDENT.
In the Knickerbocker for April, we find the
following affecting incident by the editor from
an esteemed correspondent, who transcribed it
verbatim from the familiar letter of a friend.
“ I have just returned from the funeral of poor
Emma G-, a little girl to whom I had been
for years most tenderly attached. As there was
something very touching in the circumstances
connected with her death, I will relate them to
you. She was the daughter of a widow, a near
neighbour of mine. When I first knew her,
she was a sprightly child of about four years of
age, perfect in form and feature. The bloom of
health was upon her cheek; her eye was the
brightest 1 ever saw; while in her bosom there
glowed a generous affection that seemed to em
brace all with whom she came in contact. But
when she had reached her seventh year her
health began to decline. The rose suddenly
paled upon her cheek, and her eye had acquired
prematurely that sad,—thoughtful expression
which gives so melancholy a charm to the fea
tures of wasting beauty. Her mother looked
on with an anxious heart, and at an utter loss to
account for so sudden a change in her health.
But soon a new source of anxiety appeared.
While dressing her one day, she observed on
Emma's back, just between the shoulders, a
small swelling, of about the size of a walnut.
As she watched this spot, and observed that it
grew larger from day to day, the mother began
to have sad misgivings. These, however, she
kept to herself for a time. Soon afterwards, a
slight stoop in her gait became visible. The
family physician was now called in, and the
worst forebodings of the mother were confirmed.
Her idolized child was fast becoming a hunch
back!
I will not attempt to describe the feelings of
the mother, who was thus doomed to witness
from day to day the slow growth of that which
was to make one so dear to her a cripple and a
dwarf. Suffice it to say, her love as well as
care seemed to be redoubled, and Emma became
more than ever the child of her affections. Nor
did her little companions neglect her when she
could no longer join in their out-door sports, and
her own sprightly step had given place to a slow,
stooping gait, and the sweet ringing voice to a
sad or querulous tone, that sometimes made the
very heart ache. On the contrary, all vied with
each other in administering to her amusements.
Among them, none clung to her with more as
siduity than her brother William, who was the
nearest to her own age. He gave up all his
own out-door play, in order to be with her, and
seemed never so happy as when he could draw
a smile, sad though it was, from her thoughtful
features.
But after a while Emma grew wayward under
her affliction; and unfortunately,though gene
rally good-natured, William had a quick temper,
to check which required more self-command
than commonly falls to one so young.—Some
times, therefore, when he found plan after plan,
which he had projected for her amusement, re
jected with peevish contempt, he could hardly
conceal from her his own wounded feelings. Yet,
though at times ungrateful, Emma was perhaps
not so in fact; and she loved her brother better
than any one else save her mother. It was only
in moments when her too sensitive nature had
been chafed perhaps by her own reflections; for
like the majority of cnildien in her circumstan
ces, she was thoughtful beyond her years,—that
her conduct seemed unkind. And then, when
she marked the cloudy expressions of her broth
ci a law, snc vvuuiu uaK ioigiveness ill so meeK
a spirit, and kiss his cheek so affectionately, that
he forgave her almost as soon as offended.
Years thus passed on, when one day, after
she had been more than unusually perverse and
fretful, William who had been reading to her,
on receiving some slight rebuff, started suddenly
from his seat at her side, called her “ a little
hunch-back,” and left the room. In a moment,
however, his passion subsided, and returning, he
found his sister in tears. He attempted to put
his arm around her neck, but she repulsed him,
and slipping away, retired to her own chamber.
Her mother soon after learned what had hap
pened, and going to Emma, found her upon the
bed in a paroxysm of grief. She endeavoured to
soothe her feelings, but in vain; she refused to
be comforted. “ I want to die, mother,” she re
plied to all her endearments; “I have long felt
that I was a burden to you all.” She cried her
self to sleep that night, and on the morrow was
too ill to rise. The doctor was called in, and
warned the mother against an approaching fe
ver. For three days she remained in an uncer
tain state; but on the fourth, the fever came in
earnest, and thenceforth she was confined to her
pillow.
In the mean time the grief of William had
been more poignant even than that of his sister.
Thrice he had been to her bedside to kiss her
pallid cheek; but she turned her face resolutely
away, and refused to recognize him. After
these repulses he would slowly leave the room,
•and going to his own chamber, sit brooding for
hours over the melancholy consequences of his
rashness. Owing to the previous enfeebled
health of Emma, the fever made rapid progress,
and it soon became apparent that she must die!
William, in consequence of the violent aversion
of his sister, had iatterly been denied admittance
to the chamber, though he lingered all day about
the door, eagerly catching the least word in re
gard to her state, and apparently unmindful oi
all other existence.
One morning there was evidently a crisis ap
proaching; for the mother and attendants, hurry
ing softly in and out the sufferer’s chamber, in
quick whispered words gave orders or imparted
intelligence to others. William saw it all, and
with the quick instinct of affection, seemed to
know what it foreboded. Taking his little stool,
therefore, he sat down beside the chamber door,
and waited in silence. In the meantime, the
mother stood over the dying child, watching
while a short unquiet slumber held her back for
a little longer. Several times a sweet smile
trembled around the sufferer’s lips, and her arms
moved as if pressing something to her bosom.
Then she awoke, and fixing her eyes upon her
mother, whispered faintly, “1 thought William
was here." A stifled sob was heard at the door,
which stood partly open. Mrs. G-, stepped
softly out, and leading William to the bed side,
pointed to his dying sister. He threw himself
upon her bosom, and pressing his lips to her
pale cheek, prayed for forgiveness. Emma did
not heed him ; but looking again in her mother’s
face, and pointing upward said softly: “I shant
be so there!—shall I, mother?”
“ No, my child!” replied the weeping parent;
“ I hope not. But don’t talk so, Emma. For
give your poor brother, or you’ll break his
heart.”
Emma tried to gasp something; but whatever
it was, whether of love or hate, it neve'- reached
a mortal ear. In a few moments she was no
more.”—Christian Register.
We would affectionately caution all our juven
ile readers against the unkind practice of treat
ing contemptuously any of God’s creatures,—es
pecially our fellow beings, on account of any
affliction they may be called to suffer. But
Emma was wrong as well as William. When
her brother came and asked her pardon she
ought to have received him kindly. Jesus for
gave those who reviled him;—Stephen prayed
for those who persecuted him; and Jesus com
mands us to forgive those who tresspass against
us. Now if Emma had suffered her affliction
patiently, and had forgiven her brother, she
would have acted more like a Christian, and
would have died more happily than she did. It
is a great sin for us to refuse to forgive those who
treat us improperly. But we need grace to help
us to forgive, and God has promised to give us
that grace if we pray for it.—Ed. So. Chr. Ad.

THE THREE SABBATH MORNINGS.
The eastern sky is just blushing in the beams
of the rising sun.
'A* first from this delightful land, he spruds
Hi* orient ram on he A. tree, fruit, and flower,
Glistening with dew,’
Beautiful is that slcy, and beautiful the beams
of that rising sun.
Every honey-dropping flower and every blade
of grass sparkle, as if hung with diamonds. The
air is laden with the richest odors, which ’
up from the enamelled earth like early incens&—
in tribute to Him who spread abroad such beauty
and enchantment. 1
Nature rejoices in the light; every grove <
echoes with the music of birds, and every tangled
nook with the humming sound of insects.
The. animal tribes come gamboling forth, ex- ’’
ulting in the fulness of renovated strength. They
come not to prowl and plunder; for all is inno
cence. The lamb and the tawny wolf sport
together; the hawk and the dove wash their
wings at the same ripple.
The earth seems sanctified, the very air holy •
the sky, the deep blue sky, seems to grow more
soft and beautiful, as the moon advances; the light
clouds, that float so gently over its surface, are
of such snow whiteness, that they seem like a
resting-place for angel gazers. And well I ween
that angels are gazing down, for never was
world wrapt in robes of richer beauty.
How tranquil is the bosom of the sinless man,
who now comes forth from his slumbers! He
is passing on to the place where he would pour
out his orison ; his eye is fixed heavenward; and
his face is ardent, as if with Schekinal glory; for
care hath not worn it; it is not marred by sorrow,
nor darkened by guilt: he is yet in the image of
his Creator, and the destroyer hath not set bis
seal upon his brow.
His meek partner keeps her way by his side;
the same holy thrill of quiet rapture pervading
her bosom. On she presses with her lord, with
equal step, save when her snowy fingers stay a
moment to dally in the mane of a majestic liori,
or stoops to sleek the glossy coat of the spotted
leopard, which has come near to give its greeting
to the passing pair.
‘ The groves were God’s first temples;’ there
it is, that Adam, sole priest of nature, offers up",
his first morning’s devotions; his consort, witn
mild blue eye uplifted, making the responsive 1
Amen.
What a prayer! It is not penitence; it is the
gushing words of love; it comes from the deep
wells of two hearts, as yet unpoisoned by sin.
It is adoration of souls, whose master-passion is
absorption in the divine image; it is the pure
tribute of the affections; affections as yet unsul
lied by a single stain, unruffled by a single fear
of the Being on whom they rest; it is the giving
of glory, and praise, and power, to the ever-living
God—the ‘ Father in Heaven.’
The tribute is accepted ! It goes up like the
fragrance of heaven’s golden censure, or the hal
lowed flame of a proto-matyr!
Oh! it is a moving, but beauteous sight, to
mark the holy pair, presenting this, their first
morning’s tribute! Every sound lulled, save the
sound of thanks; every breath hushed, save the
breath of praise. All is still—beast, bird, and
bee; even the breeze hath folded its wings ; 1 nor
leaf nor flowret stirs’—nature herself keeps quiet,
for her only ministers wait at the altar! It is •
Earth's First Sabbath Morning. It is the first
and last Sabbath of Adam in Paradise, for ere the
next, sin had dashed its gall into the cup of hu
man life, and the hapless pair had '
‘ Hand in hand, with wandering step and slow,
Through Eden took their solitary way.’
Time passed on. More than forty centuries
had filled their cycles. Messias had descended
from on high , and his feet had trodden the streets
of the sacred city. He had labored. He had
wept. He had prayed. He had groaned. He
had bled. He had died. And they had done
unto the King of Glory as they listed. Dark
ness had settled over Salem; and Silence, her
1 sister-twin,’ had stretched her leaden sceptre
over all her hills. Earth was prostrate in slum
ber—
‘ And Nature aa a meek and peaceful child,
Slept sweetly on the bosom oi her God.’
The queen of night had shot out her bark upon
the ethereal sea, and now looked calmly down,
with her pure rays upon the quiet city, as though
guilt had never disturbed the passions of its sleep
ing people.
The breeze from Olivet, and the purling sound
of ‘ Kedron’s lonely brook, or Siloa’s sweeter
fount,’ sent their murmurs on the quiet air, like
magic music on moon-lit waters.
All, all were slumbering—the skeptical
Scribe, the canting Pharisee, the scowling Priest,
and the sycophantic Priest repose softly on their
pillows , for the innocent object of their malignity
has become their prey. ‘ The man of sorrows,’
the meek Jesus, has yielded a victim to the com
bined hatred of his persecutors—the sepulchre
was made sure, the stone was sealed, the watch
set!
But let us stay awhile—the night has advan
ced almost into morning. The city still sleeps.
All is yet quiet, save now and then the howling
of the watch-dog, or the twittering sound of the
bat, seeking its retreat
Not far beyond the western wall may be heard
the slow and heavy tread of a few brazen-footed
soldiers, or the jarring of lances against the
mailed corslets of these veteran Romans. They
are at the side of that sealed tomb. They sire
watching the remains of the despised Nazarine!
The last star of night is now dying out upon
its high tower ; and the grey gleams of light,as
they shoot up from the East, reveal the hazy out
lines of the surrounding hills. But lo, the earth
trembles and quakes! These veteran warriors
turn pale, and become as dead men. The heav
ens open ; and light, more brilliant than the sun
at noontide, bursts around them. The sound of
angel voices fills the air, and from amid 'the
choral throng a white-robed seraph appears, his
face is like the sun, and his raiment as the light
ning.
The sealed stone is rolled away from the mouth
of the guarded tomb. The dead shakes off his
cerements, and comes forth, beautiful in his ma
jesty !
Again the sounds of golden harps sweep
through the high air, and the angel throng, with
loud hallelujahs, repass th ? portals of heaven.
The rapturous intelligence of a risen Saviour,
fills its high vault with shouts of glory and songs
of praise. Death is vanquished; the grave has
been robbed of its prey ; Christ hath risen ; his
peaceful reign has commenced; the first Sab
bath Morning of Christianity has dawned upon
a long benighted world 1
Ages ana empires had passed away. Change
had followed change. States, cities, and temples,
had crumbled before the corroding influence of
years.
Other states, other cities, and other temples, ex
ist not at all; neither by heaven, for it is God's
| throne,’ etc. At another time little Peter had
j accompanied his mother to the village of Sher
cock, in the county of Cavan; he was eating a
; piece of bread. Well said a man who knew him,
‘ Well, Peter, you are eating your bread.’ 1 Yes,’
replied the boy, ‘lam; but remember what
our Lord hath said, ‘ Man shall not live by bread
alone, but by every word which proceedeth from
the mouth of God.’—Cos. Teacher,
