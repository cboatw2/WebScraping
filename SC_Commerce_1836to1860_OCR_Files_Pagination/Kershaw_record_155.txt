Camden Commernal Courier.
THE Establishment of the COMMERCIAL 1
COURIER was rendered necessary by the inconvenience
to which out citizens have been subjected
for the want of a publio channel of communication
which in a commercial community like Camden, is '
essentially necessary, and consequently the COURIER
8 claim on the public is such as should en- i
sure a liberal patronage
The undersigned have spared no trouble or expense
in obtaining the best workmen in order to i
render the Paper nil the advantages that it will
admit of, and affording satisfaction to its patrons.
In political matters the Courier will lake no
part; the design being to publish a Paper adapted
to the interest or all, which could not be effected
by its entering into the arena of Politics?it will
be confined principally to such matter as appertains
to Commerce, Agriculture and Amusement.

pathat cotton ciiv. |
rR 111S Gin can be made double, or single. If
P made double, they reduce labor, and gin just
louble, the quantity of cotton over the single cylinler
Gin, no other knd having been in use pievous
:o this patent; and whe her single or double, they i
ire found to improve the quality of the cotton, by j
more perfectly cleaning it. T hey can be made to |
contain from 20 to ltiOsaws in a stand, and whether !
nnall oi large, one hand will be sufficient to attend
them. The Gins have mechanical feeders and
hoppers attached to thoin, which free the cotton
Irom leaves, trash, dirt, &c. before it can teach the
saws, and b^ the thorough hackling operation it
receives from the feeders, which make two revolutions
to one of the saws, it is almost in a half
[rimed state, before it descends to the saw By a
very simple arrangement of a screw to each set ol
unntos, ??n which the hoppers rest, n'd through
which the teeth of the feeders pass, they can be
made to teed slow or fast to suit the condition of
Ihe cotton at the lime. When made double, the
saws are placed on two sets of cylinders and turn
upon each other in opposite directions, and are 1
jleansed by two 6ets oi brushes that have four revo- ^
lotions to one of twe saw. The two cylinders can
tie detached so as to enable the planter to run one
ir both at pleasure, although embraced with feed< rs.
ifce. in one stand. The whole is put in operation
with a drum and band, as in the ordinary Gin, and
may be propelled by horse, steam, or water power.
It may also he propelled by iron running gear.
The lorce required to work it, is about the same as
that necessary to inovean equal number of saws in
the common Gin. This Gin has been put in
iperation in New Orleans for two or three weeks,
ind its success tested in the presence of a large
number of planters, merchants and others, and
received their general approbation
Several gentlemen have been so kind as to give
!he Patentee 1heir written opinion inspecting the
merits of the Gin. A number of others could be
idded, but the following are deemed sufficient:
Prom bis Excellency Gov. White of Louisiana.
New Orleans, F'?b. 2"7. 1H37.
wr. a. jones??ir, In reply to your enquiry,
tvlial I think of your improved Cotton Gin, I have
.osuv. that I smv it work on Saturday iheSJolh inst.
ind was very much pleased with its performance.
Plie mere fact of its self-feeding, seems to me 1o
w a very valuable improvement; and besides, the
pi.tlity of tlie cotton, as it comes out of the process
appeared to me to be better and cleaner than
Voin the common Gins in use, and that it saves
mns.dernbly in labor. Respectfully, iVc.

Three favoiublr impressions ol the advantages of

Dr. A. Jo' es?Dear Sir, in answer tc your inquiry
of my opinion of jour Patent Cotton Gin, I
beg leave to stale, that 1 v as fifteen years engaged
in the co'ton iactoiies ol Manchester, England,
and during lour years ?f that time, 1 \\ as
foremen in the house of Messrs. Lewis, Williams
A Co., and near five years spinner in the house ol
Messrs. landlord A- Gaene. 1 have s< en your
Cotton Gin in operation, and have examinee the
cotton ginned by i<, and prcnounee it belter cleansed,
and the staple less injured, than any cotton
that ever come under my observation. It is completely
ren> y lor the breaker withr ut the aid cl the
blower, and would, then fore, save the first proerrs
in manufacturing the article. I consider cotton
cleansed by j'our Gin, would command from one
to two cents on the pound more than the average
ciops brought into the Manchester market, and
cleansed by common Gins \? urs, very resp'ly.
