CORN CROP.
Volney Osicrgo co., JYor. 27, 1888.
Mr. Buel?Sir?I saw in your March
number of the Cultivator, a premium oftlrtd
on several article of agriculture ; 1 therefore
send you a statement of one acre of corn
raised by me this season, hoping that if I do
not prove a successful competitor, the cause
of agriculture may receive an additional witness
in its behalf. The soil is a warm grave!;
tiiccorn was the yellow variety* About
ihe 1st of May, I carried on and spread, all
over the ground, seventeen loads of stable
end barn-yard un fermented manure,
plougheJ before the manure dried; bushed
and harrowed the ground wdl, being care,
ful not to disturb the sod. whit h ha . lain to
pasture four years: und on the 14th and
15 h of May, planted the same, three feet
and 3 inches opart each way. It was diess.

house ashes, mixed with one end a half bush,
els of plaster, when it made i s appearance
: above ground. On the 10th Jane, went
through between the rows both ways with
' rultivator ; 18th June, cultivator both ways
then thinned to four stalks in each It'll, and
hoed out the weeds. On the 3d July, cultivator
both ways, and commenced hoeing;
put no more earth about the hills than wo
took from them, but carefully cleaned out
all the weeds from the hills. The seed was
prepared by rolling in tar water and plaster.
The corn was cut up the 1st of September,
at the ground, and shocked in small shocks,
and on the 25th it was husked and housed.
The product is 110 bushels of first rate
corn, and 6 bushels of second rate, making
in all 116 bushels of com, and four loads
of stalks per acre.

BLACK SCA WHEAT. j
A friend in INn.ulsco: County, requested
us to procure hinj some wheat that would
not rust. Knowing ihat Mr. Jcwett of
Windsor, raised a valuable kind, wo wrote
to him respecting i', and recei-.ed the follow,

information and ougkt to bo made public.
He will therefore, excuse us fur publishing j
it.
If he will be so kind as to inform us, or
rather the farmers through our paper, how
he prepures his seed for sowing?quantity

Mr. Scavey:?I received your lines yes. j

is, my wheat is the true Black Sea Wheat an l j
when you sec it growing you will know it;
from any other by observing about one six., j
tecnth part of the heads being short and j
square as a square block with four or six'
rows on a head. The kernel is largo and
lull. It generally makes from forty-seven,1
to fifty pouu s of flour, whiter and better !
than any other kind lever had. It has
?ever been known to rust as yet; it has been
aowed in almost ail situations in this vicinity,
side by side with otht r wheat, and the .
other wheat has been hardly worth reaping,:
but this was goo:.' an 1 f .and not a par- :

received from France ten years sir :e (soon j J

Citron IVtpion.?This most excellent i j
and delicious ar icle w s introduced into ,
this conn:rv by Commodore Porter, who*;
gave a few of the seed to Lieut. Gamble,' j
then at the navy.yard in this city, who cul- .
tivatcd them successfully. Lieu'. Gamble s
was transferred to the navy.yard at New 1 ^
York, at which place lie continued the cul. ? [
tivation, and it gradually spread over Long : j
Islan and along the banks oflho Hudson. c
In the wheat growing districts of New c
York, it has almost entirely superseded the , j
common pumpion. It poss^sees all the j .
good qoaltities of tiie pumpions and squash ,
it is neither watery nor stringy, makes a j
most dehcious pie, far superior to that made j c
of the former, and goes much farther. It is 11
j also served up at table with meat, in the | s
same manner as the squash, and if not su \
periour it is certainly equal to the best of .1 \
the species. For all culinary purposes it is ( I
a super.our ar icle, and as it contains a vast j r
proportion of saccharine matter, we are per- c
suaded that it would be highly beneficial to c
cattle, especially milch cows. Another J;
great nno very decided advantage is that the t,
citron pump on may be readily preserved a
througliout the whole winter, provided they v
are k' pt free from the influence of frost, p
The sc ed may be planted at the usual a
time of olantin^ :ho numnion in the spring. s

ing employment to those who most need if, th
and the productiveness and early maturity eti

enture to predict that in ten years we slmii

OT HIE INVESTIGATING COMMITTEE.
(Continued)
! PART III. THE CORRECTMESS OF THE RETURN!
WH1CR HAVE BEEN MADE BY THE PRESENT
COLLECTOR AND VAVAL, OFFICERS OF THE
PORT OP .NEW YORK, RESPECTIVELY.
' Conclusions of the Committee.
1st. That the returns of the collector ol
customs at the port of New York have not
been correct, as they have not at ail times
embraced, as paid into the public Treasury,
1 tho moneys received by him jr unasccr|
turned duiics, and at no lime for duties paid
; under protest.
i id. That said collector, in his returns,
' has violated the instructions of the Treasury
j Depariment ; has pot at defiance the du.ies
assigned him by the Secretary of the TreuI
sury; lias repudiated the official decision of
| the responsible law-officer of the Executive
dcpaitment; and is guilty of an illegal re.
tention and use o( the public money, in tho
amount tlien held by him for protest and
' liuascertained duties.
3d. That the Committee has been prci
vented from ascertaining what is the exI
tent of the illegal retention and use of the
I public money by the present collector of the
' port of New York, cither in funds collected
under protest, or furunasccitained du?i??
nr it, /-.thf'P l"iirwl?j p.nli^rtrd hv him he.
cause of his refusal to exh bit his own book
of casii deposites in bank, or to permit the
banks used by hirn as depositories to ex.
hibit their accounts ofhis dopes tcs.
4th. That the public moneys received by
said dollector are mingled with his own
moneys on deposi'c, and are not kept bv
him, nor by bis banks of deposite, distinct
and separate from the individual moneys of
the collector and of his "professional clients
and his returns cannot, therefore,
be founded upon them as a separate and independent
fund, belonging to Government,
though in his keeping.
5th. Thau as appears by the letter of
Gorhani A. Worth, the cashier of the City
Bank, the present collector has deposited
public moneys in his hands with a bank
which could not, under the law prohibiting
the selection of any bank as a depository
which has issued notes under the Jenom- j
inatiou of livo dollars, be selected by the j
Secretary of the Treasury himself as a dc- j
positorv of moneys carried to the credit of,
fno Treasurer of the Uni.'ed Stales.
Oth. That the mode adopted and prac. j
Used by the said collector, f keeping and;
making returns of the public money co!/":
I ted ! y him for unascertained duties and uni
der protest, in the language of the present
I Attorney General of the United States,
" could never have been the intention of

I ' o~o~ "",,v "'o"
officer, ' ihc interest ot the collector to postpane
the ascertainment of duties, as in die
| mean time he Would have the uncontrolled
| use uf the money." It has, also, in fulfil
m< n' of the reasoning of the Attorney General,
increased" the danger of faithlessness
j in ijw collector, by permitting large amounts
, of money to remain with, htm, an J under
. his individual control, instead ofhoing in
j tlx* Treasury of the United States."
j 7th. That, in the language of the Allor.
\ ney General, ?ititrienui tnitHqilrtt pr.all
j our reveuue laws seem to Inculcate the idea
that the intention of Congress has, at al
limes, been, that money collected for revenue
should be promptly placed in the
Treasury, and net be permitted to remain in
' the hands of the collector."
Sth. That the returns of the nival ofiiccr
; in New York have not been correct, as il
j is found in the testimony of.he present deI
puty naval ofiiccr, " that the naval ofiiccr.
i under its existing system, is not enabled, ci?
| iher to determine what amount of bonds lias
been taken by the collector for duties in any
quarter, or who are the parties to said bonds
or the dates of said bonds, or when they arc
j payable, or when such b nds are paid, 01
I whether the collector does or docs net ac.
i count truly for such bonds."

remarking, that during their whole inj
vestigation, they have not found the case to
i which the laws, as''they already exist, not
^nl.> .1 ' ?
i ui wuicn mey are ueiective. I no
permanent provisions of the laws constitute
I every necessary check upon collectors, re*
i ccivers, nnd disbursers of public money ;
U and the checks which, by law, have been
| nnd nmy be created, in the discretion of iho
' 1 Executive, have only to be at tended to anil
' ; r.pplied by tiiose whose duty it is to suporiri5
tend the execution of the laws, to en1
sure faithfulness and detect derelictions of
defalcations in public officers.
' j Iadced, in all the new recommendations
1 j which have been proposed by the President
' i or the Secretary of the Treasury, the Com'
j mittee has found either what already exists,
or what might have always bi/on prescribed
1. ai d enforced in the form of Treasury reg.
{ ulutions, and which, if enforced, Would have
' prevented the late defalcations; and theso
! ! new recommendations can, iiKlecd, be regarded
us so many proofs of what rcgulu'

receivers, dee., have been hitherto

y i The Slave Case. The Recorder ystter
c day gave judgement in the case of Calebs,
it ihe blave who was brought here from Porto
e j Rico. His Honor decided that according
0 | to (lie constitution of the United States, and
* ! the iaws of the state of New York, all slave
s: brought into this state from any foreign
't | country, become ipso faclo free the moment
* i that they land here. And that the laws
- | which authorize the slave-holding states of
* | this Union lo bring their slaves, and hold
f i them to labor here for the spaco of nine
b | months, do not apply to the slaves brought
* j here from any foreign couutry.
i* After his Honor had given this decision he
* ; caused an interpreter to inform Calcita that
- she w as no longer a slave, but free, and
f I might leave her master or remain with him,.
J and stay in this country or return to her
"! own. just as she chose.
' 1 C ilciita in reply said that she had a husr
j band and parent* in her native land, and
