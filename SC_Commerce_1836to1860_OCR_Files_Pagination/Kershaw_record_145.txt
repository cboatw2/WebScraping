seemingly high pleased. The spectators

THE DISTRESS.
No. 1.
By the peculiar Constitution of our
Government every one of its citizens is
1 " . . i 1 I. i* .
inane a participator m me uiscnarge 01 lis
legislative fiinctioiis. Thence, it follows,
that it is not simply the right, hot the
absolute ami imperative duty ol everyone,
to publish to the world his political
opinions. If they coincide with some
great and important principle, they add
something towards sustaining it. If they
are opposed to the views of a corrupt
faction, (what faction is otherwise?) or to
the suggestions of error, t'would be the
manifestation of a pusillanimous disposition
to withhold them. In the present
dark hourqf commercial adversity?when ,
the spectre of ruin and desolation is abroad
in the land, and the fabric of our monetary
system has been shaken t?? its foundation?it
behoves every one to declare,
whatsoever in his opinion, may be deemed
a remedy adequate to the mighty evil.
Impressed with these views, and deeply
interested in the present welfare, and
future prosperity of the whole of our
hitherto happy country, the humble writer.
of this and the following essays, would I

his views of the present stale of our
a flairs, and his suggestions of a remedy.
To obviate the imputation of arrogance,,
he will do nothing but point to the present
monetary distress, which hangs like
an incubus upon trade paralyzing its energies
and prostrating its strength, and to
the diversity of opinion, which is entertained
every where, in Congress and out
of Congress, concerning the causes of
that distress, and the remedies necessary
to dissipate it now, and prevent a like occurrence
in tilo future. He who would
attempt to cure a disease, whether physical,
political or otherwise, without distinctly
perceiving and sufficiently comprehending
its cause, is the mere empiric,
to whom little is to be trusted. It is absolutely
essential to the proper suggestion
and application of a legitimate and adequate
remedy, tint the cause of the evil,
which requires the remedy, should be, in
every particular, perfectly known. This
position is as self-evident as any moral
position possibly can be. The knowledge
of the cause is absolutely necessary; it is
the sine qua non. And how are we to
attain this knowledge? Surely, by patiently
investigating the cause, under the
influence of perfectly pure intentions, and
the sacred determination to arrive, if possible,
at truth. The determination must
be sacred, and the mind must be entirely
divested of the bias of preconceived prejudices,
or opinions. If this is otherwise
the attempt would be vain, not "to sny
contemptible. If the motives of ambition,
party opposition, or any other unhallowed
motive, cnicr at all into the consideration
of the question, and operate
upon the intellect, the decision will infalJably
be erroneous in some particular or
other. In the present hour of gloom and
uncertainty, when the sun of prosperity
.? t .L I I i?
ji<?b jiussuu uumiici inu ciouu 01 auversuy,
whoso shade has darkened our land, lie
who would enter upon the arena of congressional
discussion, with a mind in any
degree influenced by the narrow views of
party or passion, is unlit to bo the legislator
of enlightened freemen, and only
worthy of the utmost contempt. Without
being entirely divested of such an influence,
he can never arrive at truth. If
he yields to it, like the light of a marsh
meteor, it will lead him into the quagmire
of error and ruin to his country.
There, instead of looking upon the question
as he ought, in the full light of a meridian
sun, he will sec it by the flickering
blaze of an uncertain and fictitious
light. His mind will be warped?the ques*
tion, viewed through the mist of prejudice
or passion, will be but imperfectly perceived,
and the decision, instead of being
dictated by a sublime and comprehensive
policy, will be moulded, so as to suit the
littlo views and interest? of a party. But
it is not to be supposed?wc deprecate llto
id?a?at any rate we caunol suppose it u
priori. That the mighty geniuses of our
| land, the.chosen legislators of our country,
will act under the i'lUueuce of such
impure and unhallowed motives. But,
alas! for human nature, still " we do
fear it,"
Mr. Van Buren in his Message, has unquestionably
stated correctly, so far us it
goes, the true causes of the present stale
of atltTirs. The great fault is, that he is
not sufficiently comprehensive in his views
that he has not touofyed upon the lulluence
of some acts of the late administration,
which candor should have compelled him
to touch upon, and that he has giveu an

immaterial circumstances,yyhichteould have
had scarce any effect whatsoever. Tiiat
the present monetary distress, occasioning
the utter prostration of trade and credit,
had for iis immediate causes, overtrading
and reckless speculation, they being j
occasioned in this country, by the execs-j
sivc issue of State Bank paper, is just as |
unquestionably true, as that the degree
of the price of the labor depends upon
the proportion between the amount of
labor in the market and the demand for
it. Those simple and obvious facts could
easily have beeh discovered by the most
common understanding. But it is the
duty?the essential duty of a scientific
inquiry, if we wish to apply a proper
remedy to?an evil, not to slop at the immediate
and obvious causes, but to search
out the causes of the causes?to go down
to the foundation?to the very first link
in the chain, ascend through all its concatenations,
to the ultimate effect. This
it is obvious to reason, is the only safe
I mode, of illV(>iltiirnlion. 'Pic trim llmro m n
C some
things, which, f??r the mere purpose
of the remedy, might be well left nut.
But, if we wish to preserve the symmetry,
proportion end harmony of the whole,
they must be preserved. In fart, it is
not possible, that u.iy one part c< old be
left out, for once break a link in the chain
and the investigation canno*. be resumed.
The revulsion in trade and credit is
owing to an infinite number of c.ircunistances,all
growing out of one great cause.
Those circumstances might, in a great
measure, have been controlled, and the
evil, it not entirely obviated, in an almost
infinite degree palliated, by a proper attention
to the healthiness of the currency
of our country. But with that we shall
have nothing to do. It is the object in
the essay, simply to state the causes of
the distress. To that let us turn.
The great cause or foundation of the
whole of the present distress is to he
found in the unusual state of peace and
the unexampled prosperitj, which has exerted
over the whole civilized world for
the last twenty years. To that state of
peace, and to the boundless impulse which
| it gave to the desire ot pecuniary gain,
1 that most universal ami overpowering
I principle of human action, may he ultimately
traced the present unparalelled
state of affairs. Hence, it would se?im,
that universal peace, from an arrogant
and presumptuous principle of our nature,
is almost us fatal to man in one point of
view, as one is in another. One great
difference though, is, that in the former
instance, the fatal result, could it have
been foreseen, which, perhaps without a
single lesson from experience, was not in
the power of the intellect of man, might
by the proper action of an efficient government,
have been obviateff. This has
no where been done, and the whole commercial
world is now laboring under the
effect?the effect of peace and prosperity
operating upon certain universal principles
of our nature?those principles operating
again to produce certain effects?
and they at last producing the fatal catastrophe.
That arrogant principle of our
: nuturo above alluded to, is to be found
every whore, and in all individuals. 1 is
the elevating and presumptuous feeling of
; triumph, which in the morning of success,
induces almost every one to believe, that
' no matter how daring his conduct, or how
; reckless his speculations, the sun of prosj
ponty will never cease to shine upon him.
Alas! 'tis a fatal notion?fatal to the individual
who entertains it?fatal to the
world when universal. IIow tickle is fortune
! H ow liable to vicissitudes is man !
To day he may float buoyant upon the
waves of hope?to-morrow he is wrecked
upon the quicksands of disappointment.
To-day he may roll in wealth and in luxury?to-morrow
comes, and the lightning
of dessolation has fallen upon the fabric
of his happiness, and it lies in ruin at his
fret, all hie fond hopes, all his vivid anticipations
have vanished, au dissipated
; like a fairy illusion, or like the phantoms
j of a morning dream. But this is degressing?'tis
deserting the broad path of argument
to chase the butterfly of fancy
The unusual state of peace, fostered
trade and commerce; there, producing
I considerable gain, increased the desire to
! gain more. This increased desire proI
dticed a spirit of speculation and overI
trading, which soon became reckless and
excessive; on account of the facilities af'
forded to its exercise, by the unwarranted
lover issue of paper, and the unlimited
I manner in which the banks credited.?
! This is the simple secret of the whole afj
(air. And the mannerstn which it might
i have been obviated, in some measure?
perhaps, it could not have been altogether
?was, by restraining the excessive issue
and unlimited credit of the banks.?
Would a United States bank have had the
desired effect? We think not. Perhaps it
might, in some degree, huve modified, as
ifwerp, the disease. But of that hereafter.
There were some other adventitious
circumstances,,sotno of which the Prosi-1
dent, in his message, has enumerated,
others, as some acts of the lute administrution,
not mentioued, which, there is
no <loubt facilitated the dire event, and
increased the malignity of the disease,
which now triumphs over prostrate commerce.
Being adventitious, it is uot morally
possible that they will happen again,
therefore in adopting a preventive for the
future, the motive of their effect should
bo excluded from the discussion.
| As to the fact thalEurope, or as we said
| the commercial world, has been in a state
of unusual peace for the last twenty years,
we need say little, because it cannot be
controverted. Spain and Portugal are
now, however important they may once
have been, but quidities or things scarcely
known in ihe commercial " Empire."
The revolution in France was hut the
i disease of a single day. Poland and the
Otomun Empire are upon the confines of
[ civilzntion, and war there, or, to continue
the metaphor, disease- there cannot J
affect the general health of the whole coin- ]
; merrial system. War in America, that is ,
i to say in the United States, since the last i
echo of its thunder died away upon the
plains of New Orleans, has been a thing {
unknown, if we except a few Indian wars,
which it is certain did not disturb the
general harmony and prosperity >f our
country. * A STUDENT.

The weather which for several weeks past has been

FLORIDA WAR.
How strange, that it is now almost impossible to

war, which already has so much abridged the once
high character of our soldiery both at homo and
abroad; and which, if continued to be carried on un-!
der the management of designing leaders, influ-;
cnced by rations and not reputation, must sooner or
later bo the means of bringing us still nearer to the

I the many brilliant victories, which, for the lust two

Indians for treachery, which is attributable to their

of our armies? fnot Gen. Jesup, we presume he
has no douht by this time, been convinced of the
truth of the old saying, that a bird in the hand is ;

that clatters by the side, or the tinseled insignias of

bert Hall.?II is perhaps impossible lor
great genius to work cxpres?edly and
avowedly for hire without being b?tt'>ted
or injured hv that happy consciousness.
Of this wc havi^ ninny examples in the
history of literature; and if the bargain is
strictly, that so much shall be paid for so
much done; if the work is to be paid by
the piece, and measured by the yard, it is
^itnpossiblu.it should be otherwise, ft becomes
unpleasant to erase; for. alas! each
erasure may bo the loss of sixpence, it is
true, this or that redunancy, litis or that
superfluous epithet might be spared with
advantage; but then it serves t ? swell the
bulk, and bulk is every thing! Thoughj
they would never he missed by the reader,
they might be a guinea out of the pocket
of the writer! We remember being much
entertained some time ago bv an anecdote
re I a Ted of Robert Hail. Ii will s^rve to
illustrate this subject, and to show his
views and feelings with regard to this s-iri
of contract-writing. A certain gentleman
went to Liverpool, or Bristol, (we forget
which, on ournose to treat with Mr. Ilall
for a volume of sermons, lit; offered
liitn a thousand guineas for ten sermons;
no bad pay! Robert Hall, with his characteristic
simplicity, told his visitor, that if
he were to pay any such sum lor such a
quantity of mutter, lie wot:!?! find that lie
had egtegi msly defrauded himseli His
visitor reminded him Unit he hatl generally
been cons.dercd a tolerably shrewd man
of business, and that he might be safely
trusted to look alter his own interest.?
He again pressed his offer, upon which
Mr. Hall said, that if there were no other
obstacle in ti e way of I.is ac eptiug the
proposals, the mere business like chaiacter
of the transaction the hire naked form
in which pecuniary remuneration was
mixed np with it, would form an objection
quite insuperable; that it would render
the composition insupportable; and
transinrm an occupation which ought t
he spontaneous, and herefurc delightful,
into intolerable drudgery. 44 A thousand
guineas, Sir!" said Robert Hull, *41 should
soon begin to calculate how much it was
for each sermon; then 1 should get down
to a page, ahd from pages to paragraphs
a d sentences, and at List to words and
syllabi s; should think eve y word cl. ar
gain, and become impatient of erasure
and correction. Sir, it is impossible that J
I should do it." This is, probably, a
more minute calculation than is often entered
into, except among&t those who are
technically culled penn ,-a /iucrs, some of
whom, we verily believe, could almost
tell what fraction of a farthing each stroke |
of their pen brings them in!?Eclectic\

Great Hvbi ension Ukidoe at "Fri-|
i bovro.?The lownof Fribourg is built on
t'-.e left bank of the Savine. Hoth sides
of this small stream are very sleep, and
rise to the height of about two hundred
ami twenty feet above its bed, and travellers
coming from Berne to Frib<?urg were
formerly obliged to descend the hill in order
to reach a small wooden bridge which
crosses the river, and immediately alter
by a steep ascent of about 200 feet, to
roarh the top of the opposite bank before
coming to the centre of the town. The
lussuge through Pribotug thus occupied
nearly an hour; but the Case is changed
since the erection of ihe new suspension
bridge. The difficulties were long considered
the unavoidable consequence of ilie
local situation of the town, until some
bold spirit conceived the idea of uniting,
by means <>f a suspension bridge, the
steep batiks of the Savine. it was necessary
that the briugc should pass over a
great part of the town itself, and the
scheme was considered completely Utopian;
yet certain of the authorities and
some active citizens determined to submit
the measure to the consideration of engineers
of different districts. Various designs
were accordingly offered, and tinGovernment
of the Canton g ive pr? fen-nce
to that of i\1. Challey, of Lyons, whose
plan has since been executed under his
immediate superintendence.
The gateways at either end of the bridge
arc of doric architecture, and are about
65 feet high. The tops of their arches are
12 feet above the road way, and t' e arclu-s
have a span of twenty feet The masonry
of the gate is 46 feet in width, and its
thickness is about ??0 feci; an I although
the largest blocks of the hard limestone
of Sura were employed in tins work, iron
cramps were used to complete the union,
and 21 tons of iron were used f?<r this purpose.
The width of the valley of the Savine
at the point where the bridge is built, or
in other words, the distance between the
inner face work of the two gateways on
either bank of the liver, an consequently
the spall of ill" suspended ro*l Uvae, i>
1 feet. It maybe easily Conceived thai
a good ileal of doubt was entertaineii a*
to the propriety of trusting to a span of
so great extent, and the idea oi suspending
the bridge at the middle at first, or
cured to M. Challey as the best mode of
forming the con mimic.ition. On w lulling
the difficulty, however, of obtaining
a solid foundation for a pier 220 in lieijr .t,
in the bottom ?f an alluvia) valley; lie
soon relinquished this idea; and the bridge
has therefore been constructed with a sin
glc span of 871 feet.
