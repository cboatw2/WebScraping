On Tuesday, the 29th ult. [lis Exceller
ey the Governor transmitted to both brar
ches of the Legislature the following
MESSAGES.
Fellow-citizens of the Senate, and of
the House of Representatives :
About to bid adieu to the cares and rc:
possibilities of public life, and meeting yo
lor the last time, to imite with you in delil
orations for promoting the welllire ol Sout
Carolina, I am incapable of expressing tli
gratification I experience, in contemplatin
the spectacle of unexampled prosperity
which now crowns the hopes and blessi
the labors of all classes of our fellow-cit
zens.
At no former period, have they onjoye
such abundant pecuniary means of fullillin
their destinies us a community of enligh
ened freemen, and of discharging the obi
cations which they owe to the world and t
i
their posterity, by promoting the great cans
of human improvement, and by laying dee
the foundations of liberty in a well cduca
ted population, and a well organized sysiei
of social and civil polity. And while it he
no tr? Hr? fliwftiitlv tii?nb'nl :t
over-ruling Providence, for these ampl
means of happiness, we cannot be too deep
ly impressed with the conviction, tiiat w
are responsible to that Providence, for tbei
proper use and improvement. Nor ca
we, thus highly favored as a people, ucglec
our advantages with impunity. We irnii
improve the talent entrusted to our care, o
pay the penalty denounced against the tin
profitable servant. We must give a put:
lie-spirited and patriotic direction to th
resources of the S.ate, and move lbrwar
in the career of improvement, civil, military
moral, intellectual and social, or sink dow
into that state of sordid selfishness, in whic
even avarice will be finally overcome, b
indolence and the love of luxurious indul
gcnce. If it be true?as history but to
impressively teaches us?that communitie
are less capable of bearing prosperity tha
adversity, it should admonish us of the dar
srerous eminence 011 which we now st; 11
& . . . 1 . _ _
where one false and downward siep ma
precipitate us from our envious height int
tiie ignominious gulf below, which yawn
ready to receive
I wish I could persuade myself that thes
are mere barren speculations, drawn froi
the experience of other countries, but map
plicable to our own. But I cannot be blin
to the threatening premonitions of a prcme
ture national degeneracy which are visibl
in all directions, and not least conspicuou
a! the centre of our Federal Empire.
It belongs appropriately to you, fellow
citizens, as the Legislators of South Care
lina, and the selected guardians of her we
fare, to counteract, by all the means in you
power, these fearful and downward tender
cies, and to give such a wise and salutar
direction to the moral, intellectual, and pin
sical energies of the people, as will expan
every selfish feeling into patriotism, an
impress it upon the mind of every citizei
that his first and greatest interest is tlie g(
neral prosperity of the State, and the sect
rity of her institutions, her rights, and he
liberties.
To build up the solid fabric of the pro;
^ i 1 l ! 4| |
perity ol a state, ny developing me ciemcm
ot her wealth and power, and organizin
systems of public instruction, calculated t
elevate the standard of popular morals, an
popular intelligence, is the noblest employ
ment that can excite the ambition or fas
the faculties of legislators and statesmen.In
comparison with this, the miserab
schemes of j>etty and selfish ambition, an
scrambling for office through all the filtli
mazes of intrigue and corruption, sink in!
contempt and insignificance. South Can
lina has achieved an enviable reputation b
her noble and successful struggle for tb
essential interests and constitutional righ
of the Southern Statts. Her success i
that unequal contest, and the high chara
ter with which she came out of it, were prii
cipallv owing to the apparent and acknov
lodged fact, that her statesmen and her pe<
pie were actuated exclusively by a patriot
spirit of resistance, d'^ected against a sy
tern of unconstitutional oppression, witho
nltnrirvr mirnnco nf cflfwll nmlllfmn.
UIIJ UUVI ?v? |/UI ^?vuv VI WMIMO
Let us cherish and preserve the reputatic
we have thus nobly acquired, as the R
mans did their vestal fire. Let no state
man of South Carolina tarnish her glorioi
escutcheon, by enlisting as a partisan uml
the banner of any of those political chic
who are grasping at the Presidential see
tre. The political principles and peculi
institutions of the State may be sold at
sacrificed, but most assuredly they can n
ver be preserved by such degrading par
sanship. South Carolina, and all the Stat
having similar institutions, "must not p
their trust in President," but loo!; to tin
own power and principles, for the securi
of their rights and institution*. Th^v a
*
- in a permanent minority on all questions ]
affecting these rights and institutions, and |
whoever may exercise the powers of the !
) Chief Magistracy, they will he exercised in
obedience to the will of the adverse majori)
ty. So long as this state of things shall
^ continue; so long as the Executive govern,
ment of the United States shall be conduct:il
ed by an administration holding principles ;
incompatible with the full security of our j
c- institutions and rights; 110 statesman of S. j
Carolina can become associated with that j
m administration, without justly incurring the i
re imputation of becoming an accomplice in j
r- overthrowing the essential guarantees of her j
vital interests. He cannot worship the sun J
of Federal power, and offer up the homage j;
HI of a devoted heart 011 the altars of the '1
State. . 1
.1- If the politicians of all the planting States (
would act upon these obvious principles, i
- our rights and institutions would be speedi- *
i. ly placed upon a foundation which nothing ;1
could shake in future. The whole of those ; i
States would be united upon principles es- 1 '
sential to their verv existence, and standing |
1 j
upon the ramparts of the Constitution, in de- I
fence of their sacred rights, would pre- j ]
sent a phalanx which no assailing power 11
could overcome. :
s- But, however other States may think or '
u act on this subject, I trust these will always <
). be the principles of South Carolina, and that i
h they will be sacredly regarded and faithful- '
c iv observed by all her public functionaries. ;
g I sinccrclv believe that they constitute the <
O ? l
\r, talisman ?>t her political strength, and that if \
s maintained, they will throw around her in- '
i- stitutions a magic circle, which neither am- '
bition nor fanaticism will venture to over-;
d leap. Leaving then the federal Govern- |
g i ment to run its fated career, and standing t
i ... 1
t-1 proudly aloof from all those intriguing com- ' '
i- j binations, and entangling alliances" by j'
o , which politicians may flatter themselves that t
jIihv arftsorviiur their constituents, when tliev <
I>! are promoting ilieir own aggrandizement, '
- j let us dedicate all our faculties, and all our ; 1
n ellorts, to the improvement of our beloved j *
State, in all that can contribute to Iter in- !'
n : teiligencc, wealth, power, and security. e
; In the accomplishment of these patriotic i N
- ends, loo much aitention cannot he bestow-j \
e ed on the subject of education, in all its sta-11
ir ges, and in all i s braiiches. And, 1 beg <
n leave, most respectfully, to refer you to the I
:t views contained in m v last annual Message,, |
;t in relation to the schools of elementary in- 1J
r j struction. It is in these humble seminaries, *
i- i that tin; rising generation receive those earlv ^
* i
>- i impressions, which exercise a permanent and 1
c decided influence upon their conduct and '
d j character in future life. 1
| They are emphatically the nurseries of '
n j freemen, and the wisdom of the State can in 1 {
h no way so effectually provide for the per- *
y petuation of our free insti.ulions, as by mea- (
I- sures calculated to elevate their character,
o by securing competent instructors, and fur- 1
s nishing for their use such elementary school i
n books, as will imbue the minds of our youth j
i- with sound and practical views, religious, 1
1, moral and political. i
y No cons itutional charter, however wise its ]
o provisions, can give freedom to a people, i
is We must have free men before wc can have ! I
a free Goccrn/ncnt; nud we cannot be too i
;e deeply impressed with the conviction that ;
n the es. en ial qualifications of a freeman, i
?- are intelligence to comprehend his rights ;
d and interests, with the spirit and the military I
i- skill, which are necessary to defend them. ';
e The fatal experience of but too many na- i
is tions, and communities around us, conclu- t
sivelv demonstrates, that where the great; <
_ body of the jjcople are destitute of these ; |
qualifications, every attempt at self-govern- j <
|. inent must end in some new form of despo- ' <
ir tism. In my opinion our systems ofSehool i <
instruction, should l>e made 1o assume a ' i
y more prac ical character, having a more ,
direct reference to the business and the du- <
j ties of active life. The common reproach <
d against a classical education, that it tends 10
disqualify our young men from performing
, these duties, is not without some foundation.
/ #
1. It is not uncommon to meet with scholars,; 1
>r well versed in the systems of ancient polytheism,
in the fables of the ancient poets, J
and in the scarcely less fabulous narratives
[s of the ancient historians, who have scarcely
fj a smattering of the history and constitutions j
^ of their own country. The effect produced
l(] on the minds of young men by a too cxelu- 11
sive attention to such a course of reading
in our schools and colleges, is similar to that
_ which is produced 011 the minds of young
lc females, by reading sentimental novels. It
id introduces them into a world of fancy, cti,y
tirely different in all respects, from that in '
[0 which they are destined to act a part, and
j. evidenlly tends to disqualify them from act*
1 - -1 1 ._ *!
,y ing tliat part, amiusi ine ruggcu reiumes ui
j"e life. To counteract this tendency, a cents
cise popular history of our own country, j
jn written in a pure and simple style, and a ;
c. clear exposition of the great fundamental
n. principles of our system of Government,
v. should be introduced into all our Grammar
0. Schools. For the purpose of effecting this I
jc desirable result, means should first be adopt.
3. ed for obtaining those works, and to secure
ut their introduction into our Schools, it should
? be provided in the regulations of the Col. j
m 'egc? that no young man should enter the !
o. Sophomore Class, who could not stand an
s. examination on the historical narrative, nor |
us the Senior Class, who could not stand an j
er examination on the political exposition,
fs Within the same view of giving a more
p- practical bearing to our system of popular
ar instruction, I suggest the expediency ofesid
tahlishing in our College a Professorship of j
c- Civil and Military Engineering. The works
ti- of internal improvement, which are now in
es progress, and will probably continue to be !
ut projected for many years to come, in South
-ir Carolina and the neighboring States, will reo
o *
ty quire the services of a great number of civil j
] ?. engineer*: nnd e m *i!I resp'* ts dcsijvihle
that \vc should have citizens of our own
well qualified in this highly important departnient,
whose services we can at all times
command. So great is the demand for this
kind of service all over the Union, that the
rate of compensation is becoming extravagantly
high, and as a measure of economy
alone, the establishment of the proposed
professorship would be well worthy ofconsideration.
The department of military engineering,
will of course be made to include instruction
in the use of artillery, and to this may be
usefully added the practical instruction of
the young men, at certain hours, in the elements
of infantry tactics. My observation
and reflection during the present year, have
confirmed the opinion I expressed in my
last annual message, as to the expediency of
combining in our general system of school
instruction, the use of arms and the elements
of military tactics, with the common branches
of education. There is no other mode,
in my opinion, by which such important resuits
can be produced, with so small an expenditure
of time and money. Indeed, I
have great doubts whether it be not the only
practicable mode in which the elementary
principles of military movements, can be
scientifically imparted to the great body of
our citizens. It will supply the great desideratum
now experienced in effectually training
the militia,?competent officers to command
and instruct the militia companies;
and I feel a perfect assurance that if genorally
pursued in our schools, the very next
generation that comes upon the stage ofac:ive
lite, will be an army of citizen soldiers,
hcitor qualified to defend their rights, than
my standing army in the world, after a
icace of ten years duration. I suggest
herelorc, that the young men of the College
je organized into one or two corps of cadets,
>y law, or by the regulations of the instituiun,
and though permitted to elect their own
)Hicers, that they be required to devote cerain
hours to the exercise ofdrilling, under
lie superintendence of the military profes?or,
who should be required to act as their
nstructor. The establishment of such a
system in the College, would, upon very obious
principles, cause it to be extended to
he grammar schools; as every young man,
n preparing for college, would naturally
lesire to qualify himself not only for perbrining
his military exercises, but for as>iring
to the honor ofthe military command.
11 one ofthe most distinguished grammar
;chools in the State, a company of Cadets
vas formed almost under my own eye, and
.vhile their improvement in tactics was strikng
to every observer,?the intelligent genlemcn
at the head ofthe institution assured
nc, that lie derived great advantage in its
government from the manliness and sense
af honor imparted to the young men by this
:hangc in iheir mode of recreation.
1 also recommend the establishment of a
Professors]lip of modern languages, the
ivant of which has been seriously felt ever
iince the establishment of the College. I
relieve there are very few graduates of the
institution, who have not had occasion to deplore
the defect in their education which
lias resulted from the absence of such a professorship.
In the present state of science,
and of social and commercial intercourse,
a knowledge of the modern languages,
is scarcely less important, than that of the
ancient. A great many of the most valuable
scientific and literary works now extant,
are written in foreign languages, and having
110 English translations, arc sealed books to
>?l>" "i?? nl'ttin lonfrimfr/>s in
IIIUSU vrnu ?.i i u IqIiuiuih ui tuu iuu^uu^vw ?>
ivhich they arc written. It is an object of
the first importance to have a class of well
educated native merchants, capable of conducting
our immense and increasing foreign
commerce, who will save to the State
the large per centage which the northern
merchants receive as a commission for exchanging
our productions for those of other
countries. Circumstances are now highly
favorable to the accomplishment of this patriotic
purpose. Let us, then, provide for
our young men the means of becoming accomplished
merchants; and not the least important
accomplishment, is a knowledge ol
the continental languages, and particularly
the French.
These two additional professorships will
complete the literary organization of our
College, and enable our youth to obtain so
complete an education at home, that they
will no longer have a motive for going to
the Northern Colleges. I need not add,
that this is an object of the utmost importance,
in the present state of public opinion
ill me I'uiicu oimcs, reiuuvc iu uui uunita*
tic. institutions.
The state of the College discipline is now
excellent, and the conduct of the Students
during the present year has, with a few exceptions,
been highly exemplary. Most of
the irregularities that have occurred, have
been traced to the shops where wines and
ardent spirits arc retailed in the town of Columbia,
and it has been found impossible to
break up entirely the communication 1m;tween
them and the young men of the College.
These wretched haunts of dissipation
and intemperance, do more to mar the
prosperity of the institution, than all other
causes united. They thus become nuisances
to the whole State, and ought in my
opinion to be abated by its authority. The
evil is no: at all diminished, by the system
of licensing. The revenue derived from it
is but a poor compensation for the privilege
of diffusing the elements of moral pestilence
amongst those, who are to be the future
rulers and legislators of the State.
The flourishing condition of the College
must be eminently gratifying to every patriotic
citizen in the State, of every denomination,
religious or political. And however
obvious the truth,we cannot too habitually
impress it upon our minds, that the usefulness
of this institution, so intimately connected
with th? character of the State and tlv
welfare of the generations that arc to follow
ns, will greatly depend upon the degree in
which the spirit of party, religious and political,
shall be excluded from its government.
Let this, at least, be a temple dedicated
exclusively to Science and Literature,
where all the citizens of the State can mingle
their devotions in harmony and peace.
The number of the Students has so greatly
increased since the new organization,
that they cannot even now be lolerably accommodated
in the rooms provided for
them: and when we look forward to the
1 ^ i
probable increase of students at the commencement
of the ensuing year, it is evident
that the existing means of accommodation
will he wholly insufficient. The
erection of an additional edifice for this
purpose, therefore, has become a measure
not only of expediency, hut of absolute necessity;
and I recommend that the necessary
appropriation be made, as soon as tho
proper estimates shall be obtained.
The College Library, also, requires a
very considerable enlargement 10 make it
i
correspond with the character of the institution
; and I suggest the propriety of ma.
, king an appropriation of a few thousand
dollars for this purpose. As I propose to
visit Europe during the ensuing year, it
will give me great pleasure to execute any
commission with which I may be charged
in accomplishing this object.
I cannot conclude this interesting topic,
without earnestly commending the College
to vour enlightened patronage and foster,
ing care, as the guardians of the rising gen.
eration.
I herewith communicate a copy of an
Act of the Congress of the United States,!
providing that the surplus revenue which
shall be in the Federal Treasury on the
first day of January next, shall be distributed
among the States of the confederacy in
certain specified proportions, to be deposited
in their respective treasuries, without
bearing interest, until the fiscal wants of the
federal government shah render it necessnry
tlmt tiie Slates should refund it. I
also communicate a letter from the Sec re- <
tary of 1 he Treasury of the United States, J
desiring te be informed at the earliest prae- <
ticable period,what disposition ! c shall make ,
of that portion of this fund, which shall fall i
to the share of South Carolina. As it ap- j
propriatcly devolves upon you to determine t
what that disposition shall be, I have do- j
laved answering this inquiry, until you shall (
have given me the necessary authority. It t
may be important, therefore, tl\at you t
should act upon the subject with as little de- '
lay as possible, and it does not appear to be j
one which requires much deliberation. <
None certainly can be required to decide ,
upon the expediency of receiving the money. (
\Vc find a large surplus of revenue accu. |
mulatcd in the federal treasury, which lias }
been unconstitutionally levied upon the pro- ]
ductions of our own industry, by a system ,
of oppressive taxation enacted in opposition (
to our solemn protestations, and attempted t
to be enforced bv the military power of the t
United States. The money is there with- <
out any agency of ours, and the act of distri- \
bution involves the question, whether it shall (
remain deposited in certain banks, to con- j
stitute a part of their banking capital, or be (
transferred to the treasuries of the respective j
States, for the use of the people to whom it .
appropriately belongs, and from whom it <
should never have been taken ? It is im- ,
possible to doubt on such a question. Hut ,
. while the justice and necessity of this mea- ,
** v '
sure of distribution arc equally obvious, <
under the existing circumstances, let it not j
be disguised that no proceeding can be |
more absolutely fatal to the interests of the ,
exporting Slates, tban that of habitually .
raising revenue by duties on imports, for
the purpose of distributing it among the (
States. It is to be hoped, therefore, that
this hazardous, but necessary measure, will ,
not continue a single day beyond the necessity
which gave rise to it; but that the Fe-!
deral treasury will be reduced within con
stitutional dimensions, by the regular process
of reducing the duties, as soon as this ,
can be done consistently with the plighted
faith of Congress, implied in the Act of
1833.
As to the disposition which it may be
expedient for the State to make of this '
fund, it appears to mo, that regarding it as '
a deposite, the obvious course will be to
place it in the Bank of the State, which is
practically the treasury of the State. It will
there be used like all other deposites, as a 1
portion of the capital of the bank for the '
time being, and will justify an extension of
its operations, in proportion to the amount
and probable continuance ot tne ueposi:e.
If you should concur in this view o( the sub.
ject, it will be proper that you should confer
a special authority on the President or
Cashier of the Bank of the Stale of South
Carolina, to receive the sums that shall be ,
payable under the aforesaid act of Congress,
and to sign the obligations & acknowledgments
therein prescribed, pledging the faith
of the S.ate to refund the money on the re,
quisition of the Secretary of the federal
treasury. It will, then, be only necessary to
request this latter officer to place the sums
to which the State may be entitled, as thev
successively fall due, in the Bank,and to the
credit of the State of South Carolina.
: I lay before you, in compliance with the
i request of the President of the Convention
I which assembled at unoxville, on the 4th of
July last, to consider the subject of a Rail
. Road between Louisville and Cincinnati
and the city of Charleston, a copy of the
. proceedings of that body.
In one of the resolutions which you
r will find among those proceedings, an api
peal is made to the Legislatures of the States
through which the proposed Rail Road is
intended to pass. for Iib'Tnl appropriation*
from their public treasuries in support of st
this great work. p<
An enterprise so gigantic in its naturennd S<
extent, and so magnificent in its promised st
results to the prosperity of South Carolina, ni
ire-eminently deserves, and will doubtless bl
receive your favourable consideration. If si:
successfully conducted to its final accom- hf
dishnient, it will be a monument worthy of of
he age, and of which the greatest empire
night justly be proud. ur
It will produce the greatest revolution in of
commerce ever effected by an artificial of
channel of communication, and not less im- ad
lortant than that which was produced by cc
he discovery of the passage round the Cape tr<
>f Good Hope. With other causes, now to
brtunatelv co-operating, it will enable Char- po
cston to reclaim her lost advantages, and
o become the Emporium of the vast and
ncreasing foreign commerce which is at
bunded upon the agricultural productions th<
rn
ji iiiv^ ?;uuiu i&uuubi^ uuu tt V/OiV/iu k7iaivo?
\Tor will the advantages of this change ba vii
confined to Charleston. Every part of the sh
State will enjoy its due proportion of them, cc
\ flourishing commercial emporium, like at;
he heart in the animal economy, diffuses in
ife, energy, and health, through the whole ye
>v stem. It is the City of New York, com- of
nunicating with the world by the ocean, ex
tnd with the interior by her numerous cltan- t12
ids, natural and artificial, that imparts sn
vealth and prosperity to the remotest exreniities
of that great State. Make C.iar- Pa
eston the New \ ork of the South, and cor- ra
esponding advantages will result, not only ga
o the interior of this State, but to the entire bj
egion connected with the city by the ties tUl
>f commercial intercourse. to
Widiin a certain sphere, according to a K<
veil known principle of political economy, th<
he benefits of Commerce cannot be local- fr<
zed. Its beneficent effects are essentially na
liflusive. ah
II' these views are just, and were properly fr<
mpresscd upon the minds of our Fellow pa
Jitizens, they would tend greatly to do away br
hat local spirit, which, by seeking to ac- of
:omplish mere local purposes, might embar. in
ass the progress, and mar the symmetry to
)f the noble structuro we are about erecting, lo
I have too firm a reliance upon the patriotic di
spirit of our citizens, to believe that these ' K<
larrow and mistaken views wili be permiteu
to sway the councils by which it is to be th.
jiamied a id erected. It is too mighty an or
undertaking, will involve too great an ox- tei
icnditure, and is destined to encounter too R;
dose a comneti:ion, to allow any sacrifice th
o be made to such views, without exposing
he whole enterprise to imminent hazard. o?

;d. As u Citizen of the Sate, without ref. L
crcncc to any local position. I sincerely as
lope that the central roue may be found to ba
tavc that unequivocal claim ?o preference, ha
[ even think it should be adopted, unless of
iome other route shall appear to have a se
lecided superiority over it. But I am sure Li
hat no public spirited citizen, anxious for so
he success of the work; no stockholder, rea- th
>onably regardful of his own interest, will ol
X? disposed to go farther. To insure sue- tu
cess in scaling those mountain barriers which fe
mveso long made strangers of kindred to
communities?an achievement surpassing
n sublimity all that Xerxes and Hannibal ac
md Bonaparte ever accomplished?united tit
councils are indispensably necessary. The of
Dnly mode of effecting this desirable result C;
will be to have all the proposed routes and vc
mountain passes accurately surveyed by vv
scientific engineers, before any comparison gi
is attempted. When this is done, it is ex- cc
fremelv probable that the preferable route al
will bo so clearly indicated, as to supercede w
all doubt on the subject. fl<
How far it may be expedient for the State V
to aid in the prosecution and completion of th
this work, in subscribing to the Stock of vi
the Company which has been incorporated, ol
I think the time has not yet come for deci- t!i
ding. The Charier has already been saved tr
by our public spirited fellow citizen Col. v<
Wade Hampton, who being one of the Central
Commissioners at Knoxville, subscribed I*
lbe whole sum which appeared from the ni
returns there received to be wanting to a
make up the four millions. Until the route sc
shall he definitely selected, and active ope- is
rations commenced, the emergency does C
not seem to call upon the States interested, tfl
lo embark in the work as stockholders. w

growing out of the mode of constituting the P'
Board of Directors, prescribed by the Char- tc
fer, as amended by Kentucky, and the rela- tc
tivc sums subscribed in the different States, th
which render it a measure of obvious pru. p<
dence on the part of South Carolina, either o|
to procure a modification of the Charter n"
before she subscribes, or to make a condi- f)
tional subscription. b
The act of incorporation passed by this C
State, provided that three of the twenty, four n(
directors should be cnosen from qualified c<
stockholders residing in each of the States of
North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, w
Kentucky and Ohio, and that nine should H
be chosen indifferently from ail the s'ock- if
holders. The amendment interpolated by d'
Kentucky, provides that six of the directors h
shall be chosen from stockholders residing vi
in that State, while only three shall be cho- u;
sen from each of the other States, leaving ol
but six to be chosen indifFerently from all in
the stockholders. This very exceptionable rc
claim of undue power, on the part of Ken- w
tuckv, becomes absolutely revolting when f)
we advert to the fact, that the entire sub- 01
scription in that State amounts to less than ei
$200,000, and that no one person there tf
has subscribed a sufficient number of shares oi
to qualify him to be chosen a director! In ci
this state of things a board of directors la
cannot be organized, and if it could, Ken- n
tucky with less than a twentie*!) part of the h
ock, would wield one-fourth part of the
?wer of the company. On the contrary,
outh Carolina owning five-sixths of the
ock, could in no event have more thaji
ne directors. I can perceive no equitae
principle upon which the holders of five
jcths of the stock in South Carolina, shall
tve only nine directors, while the holders
'one-sixth of the stock out of South Carolit
shall have fifteen. This is certainly an
lprecedeuted anomaly in the organization
corporate powers, and I think the people
South Carolina have been sufficiently
Imonished by bitter experience, of the fatal
msequences of having their interests conoiled
by a foreign and irresponsible power,
make them very cautious in placing the
?wer on one side, whilst the interest to be
fected by it is on the other.
If we look to the questions that will probily
arise, at the very commencement of
e proposed work, the danger of this sepatinn

ous. Upon every principle, the road
ould commence at Charleston, and proceed
ntinuously on towards its Western terminion,
at least until the money contributed
South Carolina shall be expended. And
it it will be in the power of directors out
the State, to revere* the operation, and
pend the whole sum subscribed by the cit:ens
of this State, in Kentucky, where so
rail a sum has been subscribed.
This pretension to unequal power on tho
.rt of Kentucky, becomes still more intole.
ble when- we advert to the causes that
i ve rise to it. By the Charter as passed
' this State, and all the others except Kencky,
the Road was to run from Charleston
Cincinnati. The clause interpolated by
L'niucky, requires that the company* at
e same time that they carry the Road
)m the Cumberland Mountain to Cincin.ti,
shall carry a branch to Louisville. It
so requires that a branch shall be carried
)m Lexington to Maysville. The com.
my are thus required to construct two
anches, making together some 150 miles
Rail Road, obviously against their own
rercst, and merely to accomodate two

of these most unreasonable contions,
they are moreover required to give . .
entucky three directors gratuitously. N
There is no practical view of the subject
at can make if the interest of the company,
the great public combined in the coninplated
u ork, to cover Ken ucky with
nil Roads for the privilege of passing
rough the State.
If the Road goes to the Ohio River, son.?
tE point on that river should be selected*

ouisville should be selected, it will insure
much Commerce as tho Road will pro

the company, it would be much the tvir
course to carry the Road directly to
ouisville, leaving Cincinnati out of the

e only consideration upon which we can

cky. There is another alternative, prerable,
in iny opinion, even to this. It is
make the mouth of the Nolechucky, tins
Western termination of the Road, which,
icording to the estimates, would reduce
e cost of it from twelve to five millions
' dollars ; while it would stilt yield to N.
arolina, Tennessee, and South Carolina, a
,?ry large portion of the advantages that
ould result from the completion of the ori.
nal scheme. The work tor this extent
>uld be almost completed with the stock
ready subscribed, and would be clearly
ithin the means of these three States. A
jurishing town would spring up at the
Western termination of the Road, wherever
lat might be, whether at Nolechucky, Ashlie,
or even at the North-western border
f our own Siate, which would attract to
ic Road a great portion of the Western
ade,?probably as much as it could con2V.
I have suggested these views, because I
?lieve that South Carolina will be restrained
ot less by a sense of self-respect, than by
just regard fir her own interest, from sub.
tribing any thing to the stock of the * Louville,
Cincinnati and Charleston Rail-road
ompany,' so long as its Charter shall coolin
the higlilv objectionable provisions to
liich 1 have alluded.
As it now seems evident that the princiil
part of the funds by which the Road is

by South Carolina, we must take care
lat the control of these funds shall not
:iss into other hands, and that the scale of
[^rations be not disproportiooed to the

to perceive that so much can bo done

A scheme has been suggested, as you
