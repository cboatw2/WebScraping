Quere-Which Legislature has shown the
most wisdom on this subject?
State of Michign.-The Charleston
Patriot says, that th#. Legislature of Mich
igan, assembled at Detroit, on the 7th alt.
In the Senate, in which there is a Demo
cratic majority of five members, Lieuten
ant Governor Muindy, took the Chai. In
the House of Representatives, Kingley S.
Bingham, Esq. was re-elected Speaker,
by a majority of ten votes, the precise ma
jority which that branch contains of Dem
ocratic members.
Illinois.-Resolutions against the sub
Treasury, have been passed in one branch
of the Legislature of this State. The
Whigs have claimded the Legislature, but,
according to the Globe, the elections for
difierent officers, show that they are in a
minority. The Printer, the Auditor and
Treasurer, and Attorney General, al1 Dem
ocrats, have been elected.
Maie.-The lion. Ruel Williams is
re-elected U. States Senator, from Maine,
by a large majority.
One fact is worth a thousand theories.
We copy the following from the Norwich
Aurota, "By the report of Mr. Woodbu
ry, the Secretary of the Treasury, the gov
ernment has lost; by bank failures and dis
counts, since 1814, $15,815,535, being
more than half a million a year! - We
think the people will petition for a divorce
from this class of Sub Treasuries."
Let the people mark it.-We have seen
it stated,that Samuel Swartwout, the great
defaulter, was either a Whig or Conserva
tive. Either party is welcome to him.
Democratic and State Rights meeting in
Princeton, N.Jersey.-A t a meeting of the
friends of the Administration of the Gen
eral Government, recently held in Prinu6
ton, among other resolutions, the follow
ing were.adopted.
" Resolved. That we will cordially co
operate in efrecting the accomplishment of
a direct trade, and hail the approach of
that era when the commerce of the south
i1frich our own ports instead of carry
ing prosperity to other cities, whose views
and interests are not congenial to our own.
Resolved, That the attitude assumed by
South Carolinain this coriesffor Soiiihern
rights is truly noble, verifying -her high
character for moral power, intelligence and
disinterested patriotism."
Texas.-The Texian Congress had fix
ed on the 21st ult. for adjourement. A
bill to suppress gambling, has been passed
by both Houses, to a third reading. The
Senate had passed a bill, charrering a Na
tional Bank. based exclusively upon the
resources of the Government. This body
had also passed a bill, appropriating $1,
500,000 for the expenses of the govern
ment; also, a bill authorising the Presi
dent to borrow 51.000,000 more.
'Death of Judge Colcock.-Jud ge Col
cock died in Charleston, on the 26th ult.
The Charleston Courier say.. "Judge Col
cock was an eminently useful citizen, and
bore an active and prominent part in pub
lic affairs, from early manhood,to the close
of his life,. He was distinguished in the
Legislature-of the State, and was many
years ago-, elected nn Associate Justice of
the Court of Generat Sessions and Com
mon Pleas, and afterwards received a dis
tinguished mark of the public confidence.
in being elevated to a seat on the Bench of
the Court of Appeals, when that tribunal
consisted of but three members, exercising
supreme judieial control, within the State,
over the property, -liberties, and lives of
their fellow citizens. A bout aine years
since, impaired health requiring that he
should seek a less sedentary occupation,
he resigned his seat on the Supreme.Bench
of the State, and received from the Legis
lature,another token of public favbr in his
~election to the Presidency of the Bank of
the State, which office he held to the time
of his death. Afier his election to the
presidency of the Bank, he became a per
manent resident of this place, and exerted
an active influence in all the leading and
rest enterprises, which have signalized
e recent history of our city. Until
~ithin two years of his decease, he filled
lth dignity and ability, the. honorary of
f of President of the Trustees of the
IiclCollege of the State of S. C. and
th mrerous graduates of that flourishing
insttiton, and our citizens generally will
long memher the parental character and
high Mocral tone of his impressive Corn
mecekent Addresses. As a Judge he was1
disting~ished for learning, ability and
steadini of judgment, preferring an ad
herence ti'iettled principles,- to a resof-t to
gerous pathway -forbetnenb egislation. In
theters of finance, his experience com
menced too late and was.not of sufficient
duration to procure-him eminence, but his
high character and correct conduct secured
him the confidence of the legislature, as a
faithful and careful guardian of the pub
lic troasure. As a mat, and public officer
his integrity was spotless, and he added
genuine religion and fervent piety to the
other virtues of his private character. A
community, which knew his value, now
mourns his loss, and will honor his mem
ory.
Funeral of Judge Colcock.-The mortal
remains of this eminent ciNzen were com
mitted to the grave, yesterday afternoon.
To compliance with his own wish and di
rections, there was none of the pomp and
parade usually incident to the obsequies of
the dead. His family, friends and fellow
citizens, desirous of paying the last trib
ute of affection and respect, assembled at
St. Peters' Church, whitner his body had
been conveyed without ceremony, and at
tended the impressive burial service of the
Episcopal Church, performed by theRev.
Mr. Barnwell, partly in the Church, and
partly at the grave of the.deceased. Thus
has this distinguished citizen, after a long
life of honor, usefulness and virtue, even
in his bnrial,set an example, pregnant with
moral teachings, and practical good to the
living. We trust that a practice, thus
commenced will be henceforth universally
honored in the observance-Charleston
Courier. Jan. 29.
Miscellaneous.
Edgefeld Hussars.-We extract the
following complimentary notice. of this
troop, from the Charleston Courier.
HAMBURG, (S. C.) Jan. 26.
Messrs. Edior.-I have just returned
from viewing parade, or muster. as they
dall i- -re, f the Edgefield Hussars, un
der thL able commander, Capt. Nalthan
L. Griffin, and as a short description ol
what I have witnessed, may not be entire
ly uninteresting to some of your numerous
readers, I would ask the favor, if the lim
its of your columns permit it, to insert the
same.
The Hussars, to the number of from 40
to 45, many being absent, and composed of
as fine a body of young men as I ever be
held, well mounted, formed apout 12 o'
clock, M-. and proceeded, by particular
invitntion of the patrictic Mr. Henry
Shultz, the founder of their town, to his
extensive atsd picturesque grounds on the
Heights, about a mile distant, from which
there is a fine and extensive view, as well
of this place as of -Augusta and the surroun
ding country for many miles. The ap
proach of the Companywas ananunced by
the frequent discharge of a brass field piece,
Eationed behind the breast- work, which
surrounds the entire front of the Heights.
When they arrived, they formed in the
rear of Mr. Shultz's mansion, and went
through several evolutions in a style equal
to regulars. After which, the Company
entared the enelosure. and dismountimg,
marched to the martial music of Mr.
Shultz's private full band, to a point ,where
that gentleman had taken his station , and,
aler a short address from Mr. S., which
was answered by Capt. Griffin; the Corps
were invited to partake of a sumptuouas
collationu prepared for the occasion,int which
they were joined by manty of the specta
tors, the band playing~ all the time, which
added much to the elrect or the scene.
This over, the Company remounted, and,
under a discharga of cannon, took up the
line of march fdt this place. Here, about
4 o'clock, they fat down, with many inivi
ted guests, to g dinner prepared by Mr.
Mayson, the inideratigable and courteous
proprietor of the A merican Hotel. The
fare was according to his usual style, of
the best that the season could afford. and
the wines ofthe first quality. Mr.Shultz's
band also a ttended, and after many patrt
otie and setntimental toaqts had been giv
en and drunk, the Company retired at an
early hoar, without any accident having
happeued to mar the pleasuires of the day.
A CHARLESTONI4N.
CI. Memminger.-Thisgentleman,who
wa-sent by the State of South Carolina,
to Kentucky, to present the claims of the
South Western Rail Road, and the Bank,
before the Legislature, has met with the
most flattering reception. He has won
golden opinions from the opponents,as well
as the friends of the great Rail Road.
We extract tbe following,
From the Corrnspontdent of the Observer and Rep.
FRANKFORT, ,Jan, i839.
To -day the Senate and .lower House
metin the Hallof the Hotuso of Repre
sentatives to hear Cot. Metmminger, (the
Cotnmissioner from S. C.) upon the stub
ject of the Rail Road Bank. By Il o'clock
the Hall-presented a most animated and
imposing appearance.. The Lieutenant
Governor and Speaker of the House was
tsated sides by. side; the grave Senators
were mingled with the more youthful mem
ber-s of the Lower Branch; the Governor
of the Commonwealth was provided with
a conspicious station; lobbies and galleries
were thronged with anxious and attentive
listeners, and the floor of the chamber
was more than half occupied by the gaily
decked and bright-eyed daughters of the
land. The Farmers, especially from al
most every county in the stock growing
region, had flocked to Franklbrt to heat
the debates, and await the issne of the
great question, and thereby evidenced
he deep and abiding interest which, the
whole Agricultural interest of the State
eels in the completion of the Charleston
Rail Road, and the uniformity of curren
y and reduction of Exchange to he eflfee
ed by meansof the contemplated Bank.
Col. Memminger commenced at 11 o'
~lock, and spoke about three hours, with a
uency and elegance of language, an ar
ny of facts and arguments. a force and
beauty of'illustradon, a grace and ease of
manner and a splendid. strain of noble
sentiments and impassioned eloquence,
which has never been surpassed in that
Hall-.
Col. M. is apparently about 40 years of
age. From the humblest bifth. and un
der themost untoward circumstances, he
has risen to the very front rank of the
Carolina Bar. He has for several years
represented in part the City of Charleston
in the State Legislature; and during the
political sruggles which convulsed his na
tive state, was a prominent leader of the
Union party. le is about middle height,
with a most afrable manner and gentle
manly carriage, a countenance indicative
of a most penetrating mind and expanded
views. During the whole time that he
spoke, his finely modulated voice never
failod for a moment, and tnere was such
a regular train in his argument, and such
an orderly disposition of all the parts of
his discourse, that he enchained the atten
tion. and left a deep impression on the
minds of his hearers.
The Legislature of the Territory of
Florida met on the 12th uIt. The Senate
not having a quorum present, adjourned
till the 13th.
Gov. Duval was elected President, re
signed, and Col. Warren was elected. J.
H. Robinson was elected chief clerk, and
J. Mosher, - McBride, and J. H. Archer,
