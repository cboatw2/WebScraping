Hon. U. L. Pine hire's Address.?A
friend at Chapel lliSI has favored us with ?
copy of the Address written, and intended
to be spoken, by Mr. Pinckncy,before the
two Societies at ot.r- University. As a hterary
composition, tbo Address is any thing
but perfect, or such a model in ihfe respect
as should be offered for the imitation of the
vocUi of tho University. There arc in it,
I mutter, some beanliful flights of fancy, \
some truly eloquent passages, and the infos*j
(ion throughout seems to be to direct those
before whom it was read to the path of lioiior
and of duty, although the advice and exam*
pics are in some cases, not well chooser).
There are in tbc Address a seeming want |
of connexion, a grouping of incongruous
ideas, and a laxity of grammatical rule,;
which we did not expect from a gentleman
of Mr. Pinckney'a reputation. Nor is this i
* alL There are in it sentiments which are j
condemnable, as subversive of right, and'
promotive of tbat restlessness which is uni*!

ground of thb charge may be found in Mr.
PincUncy's allusion to the land-jobbers' war
in Texas, and in various allusions to the Au/
thorV favorite doctrine of Nullification.?
What man of regulated mind and good
cehse would bold up that mercenary insurrection,
the aim of which b taw le as robbery,
and tbotneanp characteristic of the end, as
a noble example of virtuous men struggling
for liberty. What other roan would have b id i
the hardihood to place so disgraceful an cxatn- j
pic before the youth of our University, as a!
noble effort in the cause of rational iibcrty,!
and worthy of imitation?

be our brethren, and when the chorus
of freedom shall- reverberate from the Hudson

Have tm done the writer injustice in our
condemnation of bis offering the war of cu-;
pidif j now waging in Texas as an example
of brave men contending for their rights!
We think not. While bj tells the young gentlemen
that they may weep over the scenes of
the Alamo, where a few of the invaders of
Tens perished, he offers, as a cause of virtuous
and moral rejoicing, the destruction
of nearly eight hundred Mexicans, who fell
irbdc fighting for their country! Wc really
cannot understand the distinction as the
' writer intends k to be understood, and wc
coodcnm, with all tbo strength of condom- <
nation, the inculcations of such principles,
and of feeling* so erroneous and tudiscrimi- '
mating, in the minds of the youth of this
State.
Whether fiom ignorance or egotism, we
cannot tav, bat Mr. Pinckncy assumes for

THE SURPLUS-REVENUE.
"Much has been said about the evils 01
a large National debt; but if the experience
of the American people is to be lakcu
for any thine. the evils of a largo
surplus revenue arc slit! greater. So sensibly
arc these crils felt at t/ic present
lime, that we arc persuaded another session
of Congress u ill not be sutu red to
pass away without an effort to reduce the
revenue to the actual wants of the Government.
So many articles of import
arc already doty free, that the process
may be difficult, without infringing upon
'the compromise:* but difficult or not, it
must be accomplished. One method
which we are inclined to think will be resorted
to, or at least urged upon the attention
of Congress, is a reduction of the
price of public lands to actual settlers, limiting
of course the amount which each
settler may purchase at the reduced rate.
Such a measure would abate liic eagerness
of speculators, ami thus in two ways
I diminish llic amount of revenue from the
public lands. Hut a!i the reduction which
can be cOccicd by such a system, unless
carried to an extreme which we should entirely
disapprove. will fall far short of
bringing the public rcrcnuc within the
requisite limits. The next step ought to
be. to inquire through a Committee, what
further reductions or repeals can be effected
on articics not coming in competition
with home manufactures; and the nxzt,
what reductions can be made on articles
which dt come in competition with home
manufactures, consistently with the proper
protection of the same. This branch
of the inquiry might properly be refcrcd
to the Committee on Manufactures, who
w ill very po??ibly conclude, that a more
rapiJ reduction on sundry articles than
is contemplated by the present Tariff, will
I.a kniin, .ft if,g% n luilit #Vif ilii? tnanufaelii*
ring interest, than the sweeping icduciion
which, if the "compromise* is rigidly adhrrfd
to. will inevitably lake place in
15*42 There nil! be many, hoivcrer,
both in and out of Congress, who will
deny the right of one body of legislators
tobiw! their successors iu a matter purely
legislative, and not partaking of the
nature of a contract, as in the ease of
a charter for which a targe bonus is paid.
These men will ix: for proceeding without
reference to the compromise, and for
slashing away upon the Tariff until the
revenue is reduced to the desired limits.?
And unless the Tariff men are prepared In
make liberal concessions, this parly will
become predominant; far, at soutc rate or
other the accumulation of surplus revenue
must be slopped, and thai speedily. Its
collection from the people, by ait indirect
and almost imperceptible process, is ,
one of the least of evils, which it brings, ?;
It is however an evil, and one which being
entirely unnecessary and useless, ought ;
t? be remedied. After it is collected and . j
placed under the control of the Govern-{:
incut, it becomes a still greater nuisance. 1,
What is the fact at this moment? Why, { |
thai the Govcrnmcot has claims upon; {
Jiffereoc Banks, more tlian equal to all j,
ilie specie in all (he flanks in (he United I,
Slates; and every dollar of these claims 1 j
it possesses the legal right to draw out |
in specie. The consequence is. that all ,
die deposit Banks in the country, ami j
:>ur whole financial system, and the (
properly of every man and woman in the ,
nation, are in an important sense, at the, j
mercy of the Government. By a single ,
itrokc of the pen oxn man. (ami he not ,
ipl to stick at trifles,) can break half the ,
Banks and half the merchants in the land;
ran revolutionise property, trausfcring (
that of men in active business ami mod- j
prate means, to tbe hands of overgrown \
capitalists who alone can withstand such |
riisis, as it is in the j?oucr of the |
tJorcrnment to produce. We do not say |
it is the wish of the Government, or any },
member of it, to use the power urnicb (
they possess, for the destruction of the ,
monetary institutions of the country j
and the immense interests there with con- |
ncciod;?if we thought so, ore should not j
hesitate to add, that the fate pointed nut ,

loo good for any such member of the (Jo- |
rerntnenU by whatever naino ho might be
called. Bui without any intention in the
case, a Government wedding euch icemen- j
doits power over the business concerns of ]
the country, may do incalculable mischief,
and if uisposed to try experiments, will
most assuredly accomplish it. We might ,
crrn allow that the (internment wrre ,
in every way eoinpelrnt to manage the ,
most complicated financial affairs, and
that they had fulfil their duties connected
with the surplus revenue, ns wisely an?l
skilfully as men living could Jo, it would
be impossible to manage a floating capital
of 810.000.000 or 850,000.000, without
causing the most serious incontinence to
business men, who rely upon a stable
currency and a quiet stale of the money i

which could be invented. It would give
the dominant party immense means of
sustaining its power, and would place
from year to year such masses of money
at the disposal of the government, that
money and politics would ever be mingled,
and business would ever be trodden
under the fret of hostile political

Wc have read Mr. Elinore'a letter to
the Editor of the Carolina Gazette, with
some emotion. From thatr it appears
that our Legislature was assured by at
least a quasi repi csenlatfvc of South Carolina,
that the Charleston and Cincinnati
Rail Road, must ileccsarUy rnter our
State on this side of Blue ride, and so
deeply convinced were the lenders of t^iat
measure of this fact, that they foreborc
to make any legislative provision on-ihe
subject. We hold then, tnat the attempt
oi Mr. Calhoun and others, to carry its
location on the margin ??f Georgia, and
thence down the Cower, is net in good
faith. We hare perused Col. Elmore's
letter to the Editor of the Carolina Gazette,
ais > the remonstrance of the Richland
Delegation against Mr. C's plan; and
wc intitc the attention of our Legislature
to the necessity and propriety of providing
that no part of the funds of North
Carolina shall go in aid of the work, unless
the fair and equitable understanding ol
our citizens be carried into cflcct in iu location:
viz. unless it shall come into our
Stale this yUc of the Blue ridge. The
work will certainly be of small importance
to us if it only cuts through i sharp
angle of our Slate, not yet acquired from
the Indiaus: we cannot therefore be
blamed, if wc withhold our contribution j
to its accomplishment. We hope our Lc-I

to take care and guard the interests of
her citizens with legal provisions, and not j
learcail to the magnanimity of the others. j
We have no idea that Mr. Calhoun**
scheme will ultimately prevail, but the j
mere agitation of it is enough to learn cs
a lesson of wisdom.

Steamboat Incident,?On Wednesday,
the steamboat Providence made a passage
from Providence to New York, ainid one1
of the most violent gales of wind that
hare ristcd the Hound these many years.
She had on hoard about two hundred pas-j
sengcrs, and fortunately reached her port!
of destination without any particular,
damage, although three quarters of her;
passengers stttTertd severely from sea ickues*.
While the gale was piping to i
its almost, an incident of thrilling interest
occurred which it may be well to reIsle.
One of the tipper state rooms was occupied
by Miss Clifton* the actress, and
her servant?the next one by Mr. Coster
of New York and another gentleman?
and the farther one at tho stern of lhe{
boat, by two respectable young ladies bclitn.tnf*

ihe gale was at its highest pitch, the cham-j
bcrnuiJ was sent by Mr. Coster to the
room of Mim? Clifton on lumc errand, bat
mistaking her room, she knocked at the
iloor of the one occupied by the ladies
just referred to, one of whom, Miss l!obart,
laboring under the severe effects of
tea-sickness, and frightened by the roaring
of .he elements, and still more alarm
cd at bring saluted at such a time by an *
unknown voice, sprang from her berth in j
Iter night clothes, and instead of flying to!
ihe door which opened into the saloon, j
itte.nptcd to escape from the window,
which is only one foot scjtiarr.'
On getting out she found a projection
>f about two inches only to stand on?
beneath and around her were the raging
billows of Uic Hound. If she had released
her hold, the billows would have formed
brr winding sheet; but, fortunately she
became sensible of her situation, and!
cried pitoously f??r help, when one of the
gentlemen in the next room fled to the

fortunately ?ho was rescued from her pcrilious
situation, taken over the railing,1
?nd again conducted to her room.?An
incident better calculated to call all the
tympathics and anxieties of human nalure
into action could not hare occurred.
In consequence of iho violence of ihcj

' greater proportion, from the older lands
of their immediate Saxon progenitors*
j in every direction are they seen pouring
in; from over the Lake, up through the
passes of the Mississippi, and wafted

somewhat to regret their abscence, when
J they learn what excellent and uninlerrupi
ted health our city has enjoyed during thai

even the intensity of a summer's sun has
not interrupted cititer labors of more immediate
utility, or works of taste cud

(hat our railroad to Nashville has been rapidly
progressing; that it has penetrated
through the swamp in th? rear of Canal

borders of Pmilcharli&in, and driving
piles for a passage over the neck of the
Bayou Manrhuc. Nor, while this colossal
work has Lccn advancing, have the
great contributors to the beauty and symmetry
of our city been inactive. The
two hotels and exchanges, those great
ornaments of the first and second municipalities,
arc approaching their cnroplc'

There is scarcely anything more likely
to develops the intellectual character of
an individual, than epistolary correspondence
with friends. In writing to those
in whom we hare confidence, we throw
our whole soul?all our feelings and
views. Indeed, when letters thus interchanged,
are collected, and chronologically
arranged, they may not only form a
lest of intellectual character, but serve to
show the various steps in the process of
cultivation, by which an individual arrives
at eminence in literary attainments.
This is most decidedly the ease with respect
to the correspondence rf Mrs. Hemans,
which, in our opinion, forms the
marrow of her "Memorial*." These
hare just been published by Saunders At
