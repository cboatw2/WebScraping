MISSIONAKT.
WESLEYAN MISSION IN ASHANTI,
• WEST AFRICA.
The population of Ashanti is commonly estima
ted^ 3,000,000. No oilier kingdom in Africa has
been subjected to the reign of a more bloody su
perstition, uuder' the worst form of Fetichism.
The greater interest, therefore, attaches to the ac
counts of the mission recently established at Kl
nrasi by the Wesleyan Missionary Society of Great
Britain. The mission consists of one minister ol
the Gospel, assisted by some native catechists, and
is.thus referred to in the Annual Report, May, 1844.
The prospects of the Mission at Kumasi, the
capital of Ashanti, are very cheering. The public
religious services aro numerously attended. The
people listen to the word with great attention;
and it is not uncommon to hear them acknowledge
that their present superstitious practices are use
less, jnd incapable of affording that peace which
Christiinity appears to them calculated to impart.
On some occasions the missionary preaches in the
open air to large croyvds-of persons, who behave
with great decorum and seriousness. From sever
al of the Ashantis the all-important quesiion.
“ What must 1 do to be saved?” has already been
- elicited; and two or three young men of rank
give decided evidence of their sincerity, and are
becoming members of the Church.
An evening school, at which some of the Ashan
tis attend, is in successful operation ; and there is
reason to believe tnat me remaining scru^es ui
the king and his nobles, on the subject of schools,
will soon entirely pass away, and that the work ot
instructing.the rising generation may shortly be
prosecuted without any other limitation than what
the want of means in'ay impose. Many of the most
influential chieftains begin to evince much anxie
ty upon the subject, and express their regret that
their children should still continue in ignorance ;
while the chief of the sacred town of Bantama%
who is a great favorite with the ki.ig, has placed
his five chil Iren at the mission-house under the
instruction of the missionary, with the frank ac
knowledgement that he has lost all confidence in
the Fetich, and that it is now his conviction that
they have been dece.ved by their prie>-ts.
But all is not yet day in Ashami. Night still
hangs over the land ; and ihe partial introduction
of Gospel light which affords such hopes as to the
fuiure, seems for the present to throw the sur
rounding darkness iuto still deeper shade. In the
same letter which communicates this pleasing in
formation, the missionary slates the appalling fact
that, during the preceding four months, at least
eight hundred individuals had fallen beneath the
sacrificial knife in Kumasi : many of whose man
gled corpses he had seen exposed in heaps, with
out decent burial!
The missionary, the Rev. G. Chapman, thus
writes on the 2d of January, 1844:
Our public streets are generally well attended,
and many listen with deep BDd fixed attention to
he word of life. Under the hope ol being useful,
I have on some occasions ventured to take my
aland in the public streets, reckoning that by this
tiind our motives are sufficiently well understood,
do away all suspicion in the too sensitive mines
of the rulers of this people. On these occasions,
our congregations have been very great, and their
behaviour far better than is sometimes the case
even in lauds professedly Christian. It is by no
means uncommon at these interesting meetings j
to hear many freely confess that Christianity is
“good,” and further to express their conviction
that ere long its influence will be felt throughout
the whole kingdom.
Many of these circumstances are of a most en
couraging character, and afford convincing evi
dence that the Lord is among us. This, it is true,
is‘‘the day of small things,” but faith rests up.>n
the promisee, and our expectations cannot be cut
off. But we need the continued sympathy and
prayers of British Christians; lor while a few oc
currences inspire us with hope, even s the most
painlul daily transpire, events over which we can
UQl but weep, and which wi.l be iho burden of
many a fervent prayer until, through the saving
' influences of the Gospel, they shall he known no
more.
The scenes l nave oeett cajteu to witness uu
rihg my short residence here, have in many in
stances been of llie most soul-harrow ii g descrip
tion ; nor could I have thought it possible that hu
man life should be so little cared lot, or coitimi n
humanity be so foreign to the mind, as is the case
in Kumasi. 1 do nut exaggerate when 1 say that,
during the past four months, at least eight hun
dred persons have fallen by the sacrificial knife,
notone of whose dishonoured remains has been
laid in the grave. On these occasions 1 have seen
the headless trunks of these poor victims lying in
heaps of from fifteen to twenty, the swine, the
turkey-buzzards either greedily preying upon them
or standing by literally gorged with the flesh of
one’s fellow-men. Oiten lias tpy heart sickened
at these most revol.ing spectacles, and 1 have re
turned home to weep over and pray for a people
so deeply tuuk in error, and so lar irom the way of
peace. Often is the language of that beauiiful
hymn commencing “Saviour when our hearts
adore,” the language oi it y heart. Great iudeed
Will be the change wlien Kumasi, now mourning
with the blood of thousands, if not ‘'millions slain,”
•ball “sound the mystery of redeem.ng love.” o
may ihis happy consummation he hastened ! May
Ashanti soon “ stretch out her hanus unto God !”
Surely the Christian Chutch, even in these days
of “rebuke and blasphemy,” will continue to make
•pecial intercession for a part of the human fami
ly so deeply degraded, and so greatly needing the
kind inletference and help ol those who them
selves have tasted that the Lord isfracious.
HIHIFO. — THE CHIEFS AND ROMISH
PRIESTS.
Id the October English Methodist Magazine,
under the head of Missionary Notices, is a L tier
from the Rev. Matthew Wilson, in this island, in
Polynesia. The following occurred, Sqpt., ldlli,
1843. Says the missionary,—
The Romish priests have visited us again at
Hihifo: this is the third time after their coining.
^Z'he first time they cauie, the Chiefs treated them
/eery kindly, but told them that they did not wish
them to come again; there was no need for it, as
..they all had embraced Christianity. They came
again in a fortnight after, when the chiefs treated
them with a degree of shyness, and reminded them
. of what had been told them on their first visit,—tha
they did not want them to come again. The fol
lowing conreraation ensued
Pruitt.—It is our duty to go and to preach the
Gospej to every creature.
'Chiefs.—We have the Gospel preached to us,
and the word of God to read.
Priests.—No, you have net. These men who
preach to you are leading you astray j they are of
Mr. Wesley’s religion, which took its rise only
about one hundred years ago; and Mr. Wesley
himself was no better man than Jovili, an impostor
who was in the Navigators’ Islands a few years
since, and who deceived many.
Chiefs.—Our religion is the religion of the Bible,'
and took its rise with the Bible.
Priettt.—Your Bible is full of errors. j
Chiefs.—We believe our Bible to be the word j
of God and of truth, and are determined to abide
by it.
Priests.—Well, but we love your souls, and we
must come to teach you; and, if you are not wil
ling, you may prosecute us, and even kill us, if you
please.
Chiefs.—It is not our intention to give you so
much as a wrong word; but if you are determined
to come, against our minds, we can please our
selves whether or no we feed you, and give you a
place to sleep in.
Priests.—Very well, then lift us sleep in the
road or bush.
Chiefs.—We will give you a place to sleep in
to-uigiit; but if you come again, you must not
expect so much.
Priests—When we came the first time, we
thought you the kindest of people. How is it that
you are so altered 1
Chiefs.—When you first came we treated you as
strangers; but, at the same time, knowing that
your luieuiiou was to come and be our Teachers, i
we tutu you men, mat we uau a i eactter, anu mm
there was no need lor you to come; and we wish
ed you not to repeat your visits; but you seem
determined to force yourselves upon us ; and are
we ouliged to receive you, and give you our f.iod,
against our minds?
A great many other things passed, which it
would be tedious to mention; they went up one
part of the loriress and duwu another until about
nine in the evening; and, no oue offering them a
place to sleep in, they went of their own accord,
and slept in an old house in the bush. The Ton.
go man w ho had come with them irom the Bea,
began to be out of patience, and to contend with
them; ho asked if this were the way of their
religion, to go wandering about; and said, that the
%j0rd had given them up to a foolish mind.

ACTIVE PIETY.
It has sometimes been made a question whether
true piety is to be found in its most energetic
spirit and lovely form in the seclusion of solitude,
or in the public and social transactions which
aim at doing good to all men, and the enlarge
ment of Chiist’s kingdom in the earth. Not a
few have imagined that abstraction from worldly
cares, the habit of vague and lengthened contem
plation, of fixing the meditations upon those
visions of the beautiful, sublime, and infinite,
found in the revelations of Christianity;—to
shrink away from the rude realities of actual life,
and commune with the ideal, the eternal,—was
the perfection of piety. In early ages, under the
promptings of such impulses, and especially in
oriental countries, deserts were peopled with
devotees, and monasteries and nunneries afforded
in plentiful abundance, the means of this intellec
tual intoxication. And down through the long
history of the delusions and corruptions of the
Christian Church,this ideal, imaginative pietism
has been held to constitute a higher order of reli
gious sentiments and to distinguish a patrician
class of professors. But if we take the guage of
true piety from the Word of God, we shall find
it somewhat different from this enthusiastic and
dreamy religionism. Genuine religious princi
ple takes its rise from the conscience, not the
imagination. It deals mainly with the great
truths on which the gospel lays its principal
stress—the condemnation and eternal retribution j
of sin, the provision of mercy made by the death
of Christ, the offer of present pardon witnessed by
the Holy Spirit, the succours of divine grace for
a life of holiness, and the gracious rewards of
the world to come to a patient continuance in
well-doing. The spirit of true piety, while con
versant with these great principles, cultivates
necessarily self-examination, and contrition of
heart, and humble and purifying communion
with God: but then it is only furnished logo out
into the toils, carefe, and refreshments of everyday
life. It holds a healthful sympathy with the
real sorrows of mankind, and bestirs itself to do
irood to the uttermost of its ability. Impressed
with the force and solemnity of those obligations
which the love of Christ imposes, and which the
procedures of the great day will recognizp, if
feeds the hungry, clothes the naked, visits the
sick, and, in a word, exemplifies its genuineness
and vigor by a life of ceaseless beneficence. How
different this from the piety of a contemplative
mysticism. “Like the lake-bird which seeks
the stillest waters, lives to compose its snowy
plumage, floats in its solitary calm, is rapt- in the
reflection of its own beauty, and sings itself to
death,—so, this sentimentalism wastes life in
soft indulgence and in admiration of its own
shadow, its sphere safely circumscribed.” While
on the other hand, the active piety which is the
result of true gospel principles, walks the earth a
ministering angel, or leaves the foot-prints of its
steps where it stood “beautiful upon the moun
tains, publishing salvation.”
The advancement of Christ’s kingdom is an
end altogether worthy of the largest expansion
of Christian zeal and active piety. The great
and exalted thoughts, which a practical and
earnest religion implies, find proper scope in the
lofty designs of the gospel. Millions of immor
tal beings hasten to the judgment-seat. Genera
tion after generation passes away—all tainted
with sin, all in danger of perishing. Our world,
save as it is regenerated by the gospel, is one
vast waste of wretchedness and spiritual death.
The remedy for these evils so terrific in their
magnitude, is held in trust for the world by those
who “love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity,
and truth.” Solemn deposite I High trustees
shipl which makes it both our duty and interest
| to assist in guiding the'wanderers home to God,
reclaiming the outcasts, winning back the lost,
and both by our contributions, our prayers, and
our efforts, acting as instruments in “saving
some.” How much more of spirituality, and
lowliness, and earnest zeal, and self-denial, pow
er with God, and substantiating force of faith,—of
importunate prayer, which storms heaven with
its “ violence,” and mighty labours which rock
the battlements of Paganism, ought professing
Christians to realize and put forth I Seriously,
in this eve of a mighty crisis, in “ these days of
the voice of the seventh angel, when he begins to
sound," should every man feel for the foundations
of his religion, and stir up mightily the elements
of all godly zeal in his heart. Thus should the
holy influence of active piety spread from indi
vidual to individual,and from Church to Church,
Ailing all hearts with high anticipation of the
world’s conquest to Christ.
TEXAS.
The consummation of the arrangements en
tered into at the late session of Congress, will
add another to the great community of states
which form our magnificent empire. Leaving
political relations and results out of the question,
and looking solely at the moral and religious
aspects of the subji ct, we consider the annexa
tion of Texas to the United States, as an event
of great magnitude. It ensures the progress not
only of the language, laws, and civilization of
the Uuited States Ur Southward and Westward,
but pledges the support and protection of our
power and resources, to the spread of the true
religion and the preaching ot salvation by faith
in a crucifii d Redeemer, over a vast extent of
new shores, and into remote depths of wildernes
ses as yet untrod by the adventurous fool of emi
gration. We know how strongly the reli
gious element was developed in the first coloni
zation of this continent, both by the Spaniards
and the English;—Cortes and Pizarro professed
to feel that the main object of their expeditions
was to convert the heathen. With a brighter
light and a higher reach of motive and aim, we
cannot look on unconcerned, when the great
movements of our time throw open before us a
theatre of religious enterprize so ample, so invit
ing, as Texas. And especially so, if we consid
er it as the point d! appui, the key to the reli
gious conquest of the vast regions beyond—
stretching out into the length and breadth of a
continent. From such a vantage-ground, Amer
ican commerce and political intercourse may be
| the means chosen by providence to convey the !
knowledge of the truth to those benighted na
tions on the other side of the line.
I The Methodist Church, from its peculiar or
ganization, its itinerant ministry, its missionary
spirit, its adventurous and emigrating member
ship, is destined to wield no mean influence over
those broad lands where now the Camanchee
builds his camp-fire and hunts the buffalo. Al
ready two annual conferences are formed in
Texas. The circuits are pushed farther and
farther every year. The Methodist preacher
keeps up with the van of emigration, and wher
ever new settlements are formed, he carries to
them the preaching of the word of God, and the
means of grace. We hesitate not to believe that
in less than twenty years, there will be found
half a dozen annual conferences in Texas, and
many a missionary spirit, panting to carry the
glad tidings of salvation to Mexico, will say,
“ here am I, send me.” The annexation of
Texas will give strength and consolidation to the
M. E. Churcn in the South. From the border
lines of the Potomac, the Ohio, and the Missouri,
a magnificent .angeof country will stretch out
Southward to the borders of Mexico, where safe
fro.n fauuiical intermeddling, the Church ol
the South will be able to carry out the great
ubjects of its ecclesiastical organization ; and
maintain, unmixed with humbugs, either Nuith
eru or Eastern, the primitive doctrines, disci
pline, and usages of the Methodism of the days
of Asbuiy and M'Keudree: and where iu less
than ten jeais, by the blessing' of God, Metho
dism will number as many adherents and mem
bers as now belong to the entire communiuu,
North and South.

mthor for the extent of this preliminary discussion

applying equally to ancient and modern computa
none, and the connecting with it all the necessary
indent computations of time. All this is then
made to bear upon the personal history of our Lorn
in order to determine the exact date of his birth
and death. The conclueion arrived at is, that the {
day of his Nativity was the 25th of December, in I
the year of the Julian period 4707, the sixth j
month of the second year of the 193d Olympiad, I
in the very year in which Augustus shut the tern, j
pie of Janus the third time, in token of unicersal
peace:—and that his death took place in the 4741st
year of the Julian Period, on. Friday, March 26th,
and that he' rose from the dead on Easter Sunday,
March the 28th. The work is described by a

important assistance from Chancellor Kent in
points connected with the laws and practices ex

be confidently said to be the best, as well as the la

public have been favoured.

NEW SUBSCRIBERS.
Encouraging—Our good friend, the Rev. P.
G. Bowman, of the S. C. Conference, closes a bus
.ness letter, in the following terms, which any oi
ihe editorial corps would pronounce lb be most
admirable! “I have now sent you $43.<X1 hnu
thirty-one new subscribers since Conference. Now
if all the preachers were to send you the same
number, your list would be swollen to three thou
sand new subscribers, just from this Conference.
And why may this not be the case, i have made
ml very little effort in obtaining those I sent you ;
tnd shall not be at all surprised if 1 obtain as many
more.”
Another.—The Rev. W. J. Parks, of Athens,
Cia., writes as followsThe foregoing list o
wenty-one new subscribers will show you the ful.
edetnptiou of my pledge, mad^at Conference, in
,ood faith; 1 expect to get more.”
And Another.—-The Rev. B. L. Thomas o:
Oxford, Ga., a local minister of great worth,
write*At the last Georgia Conference, a few
minutes before the resolution passed inviting the
local preachers to use their efforts to procure sub
scribers For the S. C. Advocate, I determined to
procure ten new subscribers, and report them my
self : Having succeeded, I herewith send you the
names of ten persons, and the money for mine of
them, and two dollars in advance for my own sub.
scription. I hope to be able to double the fora,
going number before the close of the year.”
Dear friends we heartily thank you all;—Go
ahead !
Liberality.—1The friends of letters in the M.
E. Church will be glad to learn that the Rev.' P.
Wilson, Presiding Elder of the San Augustine
district, Texas, who passed through this country a
few months since, soliciting donations for a liter
ary Institution under the patronage of the Church
in San Augustine, had the good fortune to make
up the entire amount he was eeeking,througb the
liberality of a gentleman of Alabama, who gave
him $1400 for his college. This, together with
other sums collected, enabled brother Wilson to
return home with a glad heart
The Baltimore Conference.—Up to this time
of our going to press we have learned nothing of
the proceedings of this Conference, beyond'the
fact that the session commenced on Wednesday
the 12th inst.,anti that all the Bishops, were pre
sent, with the exception ol B.shup Andrew. ’
Bishop Janes.—For the benefit of “ Sigma*
who inquires imothe particulars of a case reported
in a line number of the WeMern Cliristian Advo
cate, we copy from the S. W.C. Advocate, the
following statement of fie|s :—
A local preaibcrof respectable rha.arter and
talen s was presented to the Kem ucky Confer
ence, at its late session lor ordination. He was”
a slaveholder. The law of the State, regulating
emancipation, was read; whereupon the bishop
asked the Conference to excuse him from ordain,
iug the brother. Ttie preacher was elected, and a
resolution was offered, excusing the hishop from
ordaining him. This gave rise to stgne discussion.
The bish' p elated that the reioon ot Ins request
did not grow out of any sympathy which be had
with abolitionism; b.l that be ordaining this
brother, he would su j ;ct h mself to impeachment.
In the mean time, it was affirmed that the brother
elected would no, be present, whereupon the res
olu ion was Withdrawn.
A sim.lar case was immediately brought for
ward, and the candidate was elected. lie was
present, but declined ordination, stating that he
would prefer puslp. n ng the matter rather than
subject the bishop to iuipeachineut.
According to the provigioDs of the Discipline,
each annual conference is to be the judge of the
qualifications of candidates for oruination within
>ts owu bounds. Now the point lies here. Shall
Kentucky not be allowed to exeiciee the right of
judgment in this matter, though secured to her by
the law of the church? and shall New England, or
any other Noithrrn conference, keep her consci
ence and determine her internal matt* rs? Or shall
our superintendents not go on peaceably in the
exercise of their office in tha South, without im
peachment by sc me rabid abolition sts 1 We are
fully persuaded that if the South submit to the
high handed deeds already perpetrated, not only
will travelling and local preachers be deprived of
their legitimate rights, but all our members South
will be expelled who will not unconditionally
emancipate their slaves. See the Address to the
New England conferences.
“Things as thet are.”—By special request
we publish from Zion’s Herald, an article under
the foregoing caption. It is signed by sixteen
preachers of the New England Conference, among
whom are several delegates to the late General
Conference. The document lias been pronounced
“mysterious and unaccountable,” and lias railed
forth a laboured editorial. in the last New-York
Christian Advocate to explain away its plain,
grammatical, import. No one of the signers, so
far as we know, has retracted the opinions and po
sitions it maintains. That its publication before
ihe session of tlie Baltimore Conference, was
lodged to be horribly premature by the New-Yotk
isgency, there is no doubt. l;s authors will doubt
less appreciate Dr. Bond’s compliment in clas>iog
ii with the leading N\ w-Eng'aod “ humbuggeries.”
But we respeciluiiy submit to the learned doctor,
whether New-Yoik humbuggeries—even though
bearing the imp/imalur of 200 Mulberry Street,
are any more “ marketable in the South” than the
Boston article ?
Abolitionism among the Baptists—A recent
cnculiiT at 'the Foreign Missionary Board, in reply
io resolutions passed liy iiie Alabama Convention,
akes the ground—“ if any one should offer him
self an a missionary, having slaves, and should in.
*ist upon retaining them as his | roperty, we could
not appoint h m (to a missionary station.) One
ihing is ceita.n; we can never be a patty to any
arrangement w hit h w ould impiy approbation of ala.
very.” Consistency would demand, it seems to us,
that the Board, should on the same ground, refuse
to receives dollar or the contiibuiions made by
Southern Baptists. If the slave-holder has lost
caste with this saintly Board, we marvel to witneie
the “itching p,lin” yet ■ pen to take his money.
We misjudge thelentper of the B ipiisl denomina
tion in the South, if they submit mush longer to
to the ban of abolitionist misrule.
Importance of Christian Education.—The
Hon. Mr. Mann, Sec. of the Mass. Board of educa.
i-n, in closing his eighth annual Report, makes
the following forctb'e appeal in behaif of educa
tion, founded on religious principles.
Aud so it has been in regard lo all human evils.
The first case rouses no man, alarms no man.
The first hundred, or perhaps, thousand cases, are
borne with composure, if not with thoughtlessness.
They fail to stimulate either government or so
ciety lo devise or seek for a remedy. Men wait
until the tide of evil rises and desolates the land,
again ai d again, before they will erect barriers,
igainst thie deluge. Men w ill not hear the wind j
they wait for the whirlwind. Men will not take
wtarning from the cloud, they wait for the tempest.
And the calamities which spring from ignorance,
and a neglect of the sotia) condition of the masses
of the people, are no exception to this rule. Rt,
publics, one after another—a splendid yet mourn
ful train—have emerged into being; they have
risen to greatness, and surrounding nations have
nought protection beneath the shelter of theft
.ower; but they have perisfled through a want of
intelligence and virtue in the masses of the people,
They have been delivered over to anarchy and
hence to despotism; and because they would not
they their own laws, they have been held in bondage
•y the laws of tyrants. One after another, they
have been blotted from tbe page of egiatence, ant)
