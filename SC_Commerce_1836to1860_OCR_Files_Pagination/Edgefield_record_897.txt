INAUGURAL ADDRESS
PRONOUNCED BY
JAMES -K. POLK, President.
In the presence of the Senate and People'
of the United States of America.
'CAPITOL, March 4th, 1845.
, KLLow-CITIZENs: Without solicitation- ons
my part, I have been chosen by the free and
voluntary suffrages of my ct mirymen to the
most honorable and most reseonsible office on
earth. I am deeply impressed with gratitude
for the iconfidence reposed in me. Honored
with this diestiguished consideration at an ear
her period of life than- any of my predecessors,
I cannot disguise the diffidence with which I
am about to etiter on the discharge of my offi
cial duties.
If the more aged and experienced men who
have filled the ofice of President of the United
States, even in the infancy of the reptiblic. dis
trusted their ability to discharge the dutaesof
that exalted station, what ong:t not to be the
apprehension of oneso mach younger and less
endowed, now that our domain extends from
ocean to ocean, thflt our people have so greatly.
increased in numbers, and at a time when so
great diversity of opinion prevails in regard to
the principles and policy which should charac
terize the principles of our government? Well
may the boldest fear and the wisest tremblo,
when incurring responsibilities ont which may
depend ourcountry's peace and prosperity, and
in some degree, the hopes and happiness of the
whole human family.
In assuming responsibilities so vast, I fer
vently invoke the aid of that A!Malghty Riler
of the Universe, in whose hands i're tle desti
nie- of nations and of men, to guard this hea
von-favored land against the mischiefs which,
without His guidance anight arise from an
. unwise public policy. With a firin reliance
upon the wisdoin of Omnipotence 4o sustain
and direct mi in ile path oi duty which I am
app-ointed to prsue, I stand in the presence of
this assembled multitude of my count'vtnen, N
take upon myself the solemn obligation, ''to
the best of my ability to preserve, project, and.
defend the Constitution of the United States."
A concipe enumeration of the principles
which will guide me in -the adminaistratave.pol- t
icy of the Government. is not only in accord
ance with the examples set me by all my pre
decessors, but is eminently befitting the occa
won.
The Constiintion itself. plainly written as it
is, the safeguard o our federative comnpitct, the
offsprng of concession and comptomise, bind
ing together in the.bonds of peace and union
this great and increasing family of free and in
dependent States, will be the chart by which I
shall be directed. It will he my first care to
administer the (oyernmenth the true spirit of
that instrument, and to assume no powers not i
expressly granted or clearly. implied in its
terms. The Government of the United States
is one of delegated and limited powers; and it
is by a strict adherence to the clearly granted
powers, and by abstaining from the exercise of
doubtful or unauthorized implied powers, that
we have the only ure guaranty against the re N
currence of those unfortunate collisinns between i
the Federal and State authorities. which have t
occasionally so much disturbed the harmony of a
our system, and even threatened the perpetuity
of our glorious Union.
" To the States respectively, or to the peo.
ple," have been reserved " the powers not del
egated to the United State% by the Constitu
Don, nor prohibited by it to the States." Each t
State -is a complete sovereignty within the
sphere of its reserved powers. The govern- 4
ment of the Union, heting within the sphere of
its delegated authority, is also a complete sov
ereignty. While the General Gavernment
should abstain from the exercie of authority
not clearly delegated to it, the States should be C
equally careful that, in the maintenance of their I
rights, they do not overstep the limits of p.w- I
era reserved to them. One of rhe most distin-it
gished of :my predecessors attached deservedr
importance to -' the suapport of the State go
i-eraneants in all their righats, as the tost con I
petenm adaniiitration for our domestic con
erns, and the surest balwark against anti-re
publicanm tendencies:" and to the -. preserva
tion of the General Government in its whole il
constitutiotnal vigor, as the .hee-nchor of otnr t
peace at home, and safety abroad."J
To the Government of the United States has
. been intrusted the exclusive management of our
foreign affatirs. Beyond that, it wiels a few
general enumerated powers. It does niotforce
reform oan the States. It leatves individuals, -
- over whom it casts its protecting influence, ea.t
tirely free to improve their own condition by ir
the legitimate exercise of all their menttal andi
physical powers. it is a common protector of
each and all the States, of every man who lives:
upon our soil, whether of niative or toreign l
- birth; of every religious sect int their worship1
of the Almighty accordinag to the dictates of 9
their own conscience ; of every art. trade and C
occupation,- consistent with the laws of the l
States. And we rejoice in the general happi- . I
ness, prosp)eaity, anad advanacement of our coun- ti
try, which have been the offspring of freedom, d
and not of power.
This most admirable and wisest system of
well regulated self-government among men.
ever devised by humani minds, has beena tested
by its successful operation for more than half a
century; and if p reserved from thte usurpation t'
of the Federal G overnent on the one hand, y
arid the exercise by the States of powers not a
reseuved to them on.the oiher. will, I fervently
hope atnd believe, endure for ages to coame,.
- and dispense the blessings of civil atid religious ~
liberty to distant generations.. To effect oh
jects'so dear to every patriot, I shall devote
umytelf with anxious solicitude. It will be nmy
desire to guard against that most fruitful source
of danger to the -harmonious action of ow- sys
tem, which- consists in substituting the mere I
-discretion and caprice of the- executive, or of
majorities in thec legislative department o thej
governmealt, for powers which have been with- .
held fioam the"Federal Government by tho Con-.
stitution. By the theory of out governmwent,
majorities rule ; but this right is ant an arbitray I
or unlimited one. It is a right to be exercised
in -subordintaton to the Conistitution, and in
conformity to it. . One-great object of the Con- I
stitution was to restrain majorities from op.
'pressing minorities, or encroaching upon their
just rights. Minorities have a right to appeal
to the Cobstitution, as a shield against such op
pressioni.
- That the blessings of liberty wvhich our con- I
stitution secures may be enjoyed alike by mi]
norities and majorities, the executive has been I
wisely invested with a qalified veto upon the
acts of the legislature- It is a negative power,
and is conservative in its character. [t arrests
for'thie time, hasty, incensiderate, or unconsti- I
tutional legislation; invites reconsideration, and
transfers questions at issue between the legis
lative and executive departments tor the tribu-4
nal of the people. Like all other powers, it is a
subject to be abused Whent judiciously and
properly exeicised, the Constitution itself may
he siaved from infraction, and the rights of all
preserved and protected .
The inestimable value of our eraI Union
is- felt and atikhowledged'by all2" y thin sys-|
tem of united and confederatejStates, our peo-i
ple are permiitted,eollectively and individually,.
to seek their own happiness in their own way; I
and the consequences have been most auspr-.
cious. Sinace the Union was formed, the nam
ber of the States has itnereased from thirteen to1
twenty-eight; two of these have takerf their
position as members of the confederacy within
the last week. Our population has increased
from. three to twenty mnu ions. New comtmu
naities and States are seeking pretection uander -i
!r mngis. end mtltitades- from the Old WVorldj1
rre ockiig to our shores to participate in its
olessings. -Beneath its benign sway, peace
ind yrosierity prevail. Freed from.the bur
lens and rhiseries of war, our trade and inter
:otirse have exiterided throughout the world.
blind, no longer tasked in devising means to ac
omplish or resist schemes of ambition, usur
ration, or conquest. is devoting itself to man's
rue interests, in developing his faculties and
iowers, and the capacity of nature-to minister
obhis'enjoyments. Gvenins is -free to announce
ts inventions and discoveries; and the hand is
-ree to accomplish whateverthe head corceives,
ot incoumpatible with the rights of a fellow be
ng. All distinctions of birth or of rank have
een abolished. All citizens, whether native
r adopted. ate placed upon terms of precise
quality All are entitled to equal rights and
qual proctation. No union exists between
hureh and state; and perfect freedon of opin.
on is guaranteed to all sects and creeds.
These are some of the blessings secured to
ur happy land by our federal Union. To per
etnate them. it is our sacred duty to preserve
t. Who shall aseien limits to the achievements
f free minds nnd free hands nnder tire protec.
ion of this glorious 'Union? No treason to
nar kind since the -organization. of society,
vould be equal in atrocity to that of him who
vould lie his hand to destroy it. He would
verthrow the noblest structare o( hniman wis
lom, which protects himself and. his fellow
nan. He would stop the progress of free go
ernment, and involve his country either in
narchy or despotism. He would extinguish
he fire of liberty which warms and animates
lie hearts of happy millions. and invites all the
iations of the earth to imitate our example. If
e saw that error and wrong are committed in
he administration or tie government. let him
emember that nothing human can be perfect;
nd that under no system 6f government re
ealed by Heaven, or devised by man, has rea
on been allowed so broad a scope to combat
rror. Has the sword of despots proved to be
safer or surer instrument of reform in gov
rnment than enlightened- reason? Does he
xpect to find among the ruins of this Union a
appier abode for our swarming millions than
hey now have under it? Every lover df his
ountry must shudder at the thought of the
ossibility of its dissolution, and will be ready
r adopt the patriotic setiment, " Our federal
nion-it must be preserved." To preserve
t, the compromises which alone enabled our
athers to form a common constitution fur the
overnment and protection of so many States
nd distinct communities, of such diversified
abits, interests, and domestic institutions, must
e sacredly and religiously observed. Any at
anpt to disturb or destroy these compromises,
eing terms of the compact of Union, can-lead
J none other than the most ruinous and disas.
rous consequences. -
It is a source of desp rogret that in some,
ections of our edubtry, misguided per
one have occasionally indulged in schenes
nd agitations, whose object is the destruc
ion of domestic ' institutions existing in
ther sections- institutions which existed
t the adoption of the constitution, and
were recognised and protected by it. All
aust see that if it were possible for them
a be successfil in attaining their object,
he dissolution of the fjnion, and the con
equent destruction of our happy form of
overtunent, must speedily t'ollow.
I am happy to believe that at every pe
iod of our existence as a nation, there has
xisted. and continues to exist, among the
rent mass of our people, devotion to the
niou of the States, which will shield and
rotect it against the moral treason of any
who wodid-seri'ously contemplate its des
ruclion. To secure a continuance of that
evotion. the compromises of the coastitu
inn must not only be preserved, but see
onal jealousies arid heartburnings must
e discountenanced, and all should re
'ember that they are members ofthe same
oitical-'family, having a common destiny.
To increase the attachment of our people
i the Union, our laws should bejiusm.
ty poliry which shall tend to favor ino
opolies, or the peculiar interbsts of see
ions of classes, must operate to. the pre
idice of the inierest of their fellow-citizens
nd should be avoided. If the compromi
as of the constituhtion be preserved,-if
scional jealousies and hearthurnings be
iscountenanced%-if our laws be just, anid
mo government be practically admainiste
ed trictly within the limits of power
rscribed to i,-wc mndy discard all ap
rehensions for' the safety of the Union..
WVith these views , f nature, character,
nd objecms of the gwavernmentm, and value
f thme Union, I shall steadily oppose the
reationm of those institutions and systems
ihieh, in their nature, tend to pervert it
-'m its legitimate pur poses, and 'make it
3 instrumtent of sectiotas, classes. and in
ividuals. We need no national banks,
r other extraneous institutions, planted
round the' governmenit to. control' oi
trengthen it in opposition to the ill.of its
uthors. Experience has taught us bow
necessary they are as auxiliaries of the
ublic authorities. how' impotent for good,
nd how powerful for mischief.
Ours was intended to he a plain and
-ugal government ; and I shall regard it
2he tny duty to recoinmend to Congress,
id, as far a's the executive is concerned,
' enforce it by the means within my
ower, the strictest economy in the ex
endture of the public money. which may
e compatible with the public interests.
A. national debt has become almnost an
latitution of European monaI~rchies. It
Sviewed, in some of them, as an essen
il prop to existing governments. Me
acholy is the condition of that people
hhoe government can he sustained only
ya system which periodically transfers
mrrge amounts from the labor of the many
the coffers of the few. Such a system
incompatible with the ends for which
ur republican government was instituted.
inder a wise' pokey, thme debts contracted
s our revolutibon and during the war of
842, have been happily extinguished.
ly a judicious application of the revenues,
ot required for other necessary purposes,
tis net doubted that the debt which has
rown out of the circumstances of the last
ew years may be speedily paid off'.
I congratulate my fellow-citizens on the
atire restoration of the credit or the gene
al governm'ent of the Uniown, and that of
nany of the State,. Happy would it-be
or, ihe indebted States if they were freed
rom their liabilities, many of which were
inautiously contracted. Although the
tvernment of the Union is neither in a
egal tmor a moral sense bound for the
lebte of te States, anrd it would be a vio
ation ofour compact of Union to assume
hem, yet we cannot but feel a deep itnte
'et in seeing alf the States meet their lia
militie., and pay off their just debts, at the
riest practicable period. That they
ill do so, as soon as it can be done with.
nt imposing too heavy burdens on their
itizens,there is no doubt. The sound,
n,al1 ma hanorsable feelina ofin theneopl
of the iodebted States, tanuolbe questibot
ed; and we are happy to perceive a set
tied disposition on their part, -as their abil
ity returns. after a season of unexan-pled
pecuniary embarrassment; to pay off all
just demands and to acquiesce in any rea
sona1ble measure to accomplish-.tbat ob
ject.
One of the difficulties which we have
had to encounter in the practicat adminis
tration of the government; consists in the
adjustment of our revenue laws, and the
levy of taxes necessary for the support of
government. In the general proposition
that ino more money shall be collected
than the necessities of an econ6mical ad
ministration shall require, all parties seem
to acquiesce. Nor does there seem to be
any material difference of opinion as to
the ahence of right in the government to
tax one section of country, or one class of
citizens, of one occupation, for the mere
proIt of another.--Justice and sound
policy ftrbid the -federal government to
Toster one branch of indusrry t he Jetri
meat of another, or to cherish interests
of one portion to the injury "61 another
portion or our tommon count ' I have
heretofore declared to my 'fe-wcitikens
tha,. in "my judgment it is th 'uty of the
government to extend, as (a it may
be- practicable to do so, by-w revenue
laws, and all other means wila -its pow
er, fair and just protection to l great
interest of the whole Union erbracing a,
riculture, manufactures. the iriechanic
arts, commerce and navigation." I have
also declared'my opinion to lneb"in favor
ora tarifffor revenue," and tHe "in ad
justing the details of such a tafl, I have
sanctioned such moderate diserillainatiug
duties as would produce the am'ount of
revenue needed, and, at the same time,
aford reasonable incidental proieiliou to
our home industry ; and that I *is "op
posed to a tariff for protection merely, and
not for revenue."
The power "to lay and colled taxes
duties, imposts and excises," was an indes
pausable one to be counteredon- the fede
ral government, which without it would
posses no means for providing for its own
support. In executing this power by levy
ing a tariff of duties for the support of
governent the raising of revente should
be the.object and protection the facident.
To reverse this principle,.., and inake pro
tection the object and revetnue tinbe fident,
would be to inflict manifest injustire upon
all other than the protected interests. In
levying duties for revenue, it is doubtless
proper to make such discriminations with
t the revenue principle, as will afford
incidental protection to our home interests.
Wirhin the revenue limit, there is a dis
cre;ion to discriminate; beyond that limit,
the rightful exercise of the power Is not
conceded. The incidental protection af
forded to our home interests by disctimina
tions, within the revenue range, it is belie
ved will be ample. Iz making discrimni
nations, all our home interett should as
far as practicable, be equally protected.
The largest portion of our people are agri
culturalists. Others are employed ic
matiufactures, eommerce, naivgatioo, and
the ir echatie art.
They Are all engaged in their respective
pursuits, and their joint labors constitute
the national or home industry. To tax
one branch or this home industry for the
betient of another; would be unjust. No
one of these interest can rightfully claim
an advabtage over the otheres, or to be en
richedl by impoverisning the others. All
are equally entitled to the fostering care
and protection of the giuvernment. In
exercising a sound discretion in levying
discriminating duties withiti the limits
prescribed, care should be taken that it he
done in a mannr not to benegit the wveal
thy few, at the expense of the toilling mil
lious, by taxing lteelt the lukuries of life,
or articles of superior quality and high
price, which can only be cnsumed by the
wealthy ; and highesut the necessaries of
life, or articles of coarse quality and low
price, which the poor and great mass of
our people must consume- The bursiens
of government should as far as practicable,
be distributed justly and equally among
all classes of our population. These gsa
ral views long entertained on this subject,
I have deemed it proper to reiterate. It
is a'subject upon which conaictidg inter
eseand occupation are supposed to exists,
and a spirit of mutual concession and
compromise in adjusting its details should
be cherished by every part of our wide
spread country as the only means* of pre
serving harmody anid a cheerful acquies
cence of all in the operation of our reve
nue laws. Our patriotic citizens in every
part. of'the Union will readily submit to the
paymnent of such takes asishall be needed
for the support of their government,
whether in peace or in war, if they are so
levied as to distribute the burdenh as equ
ally as possible among them'
The republic of Teaas has runde known

a part of o'ur confedetacy, and enjoy with
us the blessings of liberty, secured and
guaranted by our constitutiom Treins

wisely ceded away to a foreign power-is
now independent, and possesses an un
doubted right to .diapose of a part or the
whole of her territory. and to merge her
sovereignty, as to separate aird indepen
dent State, in ours. I congrmulate my
country that, by an act of the late Congress
of "e United 8tates, the assent of t1iis
goversament has been given to the feuntion
and it only remains for the two countries
to agre. upon the terms, to conlsutet~ an
object so important to both.
I regard the question of annexation as
belor.gtng exclusively to the United States
and Texas. They are independent pow
ers, competent to contract; asd foreign
nations have no right to interfere with
them,or to take exceptions to their reunion.
Foreign powers do not seem to appreciate
the true character of our governtpent.
Our Union is a confederation of indepen
dent States, whose policy is peace with
each other and all the world. To en
large its limits, is to be extend the domin
ions of peace over additional territories
and increasing millions. The wmorld has
notbing to fear from military amnbition in
our government. While the chief magis
trate and the popular branch of Congress
are elected for short terms by the suff'rages
of those million who must, in their own
persons, bear all the burdens ando:nieeries
of war, our government cano be other
wis t.han acific Foreign powers shontd
therefore, look on the annexation of Tex
as to the United States, not as the -.con
quest of a nation seeking to extend lie
dominions by arms and violence, but a
the peaceful acquisition ofa territory onc
her own, by adding another member t
our confederation with. the consent of iha
memberJ'thereby diminishing the chance
of i'ar. and opening to them new and ev
er-increasing markets for their products
To Texas the reunion is Important
because the strong protecting arm of .)u
Government would be extended over he
and the vast resources of her fertile soi
and genial climate would le spedily de
veloped; while the safety of New Orlean
and our whole south western frontie
against hostile aggression as well as th,
interests of the whole union would be pro
moted by it-.
In the earlier stages of our national ex
istence, the opinion prevailed with some
that our system of confederated State
could reit oper'ate successfully over an ex
tended territory, and serious objection
have, at different lim'es been made to th
enlargement of our boundaries. -Thes
objections were earnestly urged when w
acqoired Louisiana. Experience ha
shown that they were not well founded
The title of numeraus Indian tribes to vas
tracts of country has been extinguisled
New States have been admitted into thi
Union. New Territories have been crea
ted. and ourjurisdiction and laws extendei
over them. As our population has expan
ded the Union has been cemented an
strengthened. As our boundaries hav<
been 'nlarged and our agricultural popu
laion has been spread over a large surfaci
our federative system has acquired addi
tional strength and security. It may wel
be doubted whether it would he'in greate
danger of ovethrow, if our present popu
lation were confined to the narrow limit
of the original thirteen States, than it is noy
that they are sparsely settled over a mon
extended territory. It is confidently be
lieved that' our system may be safely ex
tenled, the bonds of our territorial limits
and that, a it shall be extended, the bondi
of our Union, so far from being weakene<
will become sisonger.
None can fail to see the danger of oui
safety and future peace, if Texas remaini
an independent State or becomes an all:
or dependency of some foreign nation mon
powerful than herself. Is there one atnon;
our citizens who would not prefer perpet
ual peace with Texas, to occasional wars
which so often occur between bordering in
dependent nations? -Is there one wh<
would not prefer free intercourse witir her
to highduties o:: all our products and man
ufactures whiui enter hei ports or cross he
frontiers? Is -there one who would no
prefer an unrestricted communication witt
her citizens, 'o the frontier obstructione
which must occur if she remains out of a
Union? Whatever is good or evil in thf
local institutions of Texas, will remain het
own. whether annexed to the United State.
or not. None of the present Slates wil
be responsible for them. a;ny more that

Trhey have confederated t.ogether for cer
tain specified objects. Upon the 'sam
principle that they would refuse to form
perpetual union with Texas because of hei
lotal institution our forefathers would have
teen prevented from forming our preseul
Union? Perceiving no valid oibjection tc
the measure,- and many reasons for itu
adoption vitally affecting the peace, the
safety and the prosperity of both countries
I shall, on the broiad principfc which for
med tho- basis and ~produced the adoptiotl
of our constitntion. and not in any uarrow~
spirit of sectional policy, endeavor by all
constitutional, honorable, and appropriate
means, to consumate the expressed will ol
the people of the United States, by the
annexation of TIexas to our Union at the
earliest practicable period.
Nor will it become in a less degree mj
duty to assert and maintain, by all consti
tutionfal tmeans the right of the United
States to thaat portion of our territory w hicit
lies beyond the Rocky mouutaius. Ouai
title to the country of the Oregon ts "cleai
an unquestionable;" and already ore onw
people preparing to perfect that title by oc
cupying it with their wives and children.
But eighty years ago, our population was
confined on the west by the ridge of th(
Alleghanies. Within that period-withiL
the lifetime, I might say, of some of my
hearers-our people, increasing to im any
milliops, have filled the easterd vally 01
the M~lississippi; advent urnously ascenided
the Missouri to its head springs, and are
already e.mgaged in establishing the hies
sings of self government in valleys ol whticli
the rivers flow to the Pacifie. -The world
beholds the peaceful triumphs of thie in
dustry of our emigrants. To us belongs
the duty of protecting them adequately
'herever they may be upon our soil. The
jurisdiction of our laws, and the benefits
of our republican institutionis, should be
extended over them in thme distant region!
which they have selected for their homes,
Thbe increasing faculties of intercourse will
easily bring the States. of which the for
mation in that phart of our territory cannoi
be long delayed, within the sphere of out
federative Uniou. In the mean titme, every
obligation imposed by treaty or conventiun.
al stipulatious should be sacredly respect
ed.
In the trianagement of our foreign rela
tiotns, it will be my aim to observe a care
ful respect for the rights ol'ot her nations,
while our own will be the subject of con
stapL watchfulness. Equal and exact jus
tice should characterize all our intercourse
with foreign countries. All alliances hav

In taking "care that the laws he faith

duty will be exacted from all public oficern
Fro~m those officers, especially, who arc
charged with the collection and disburse

account for the moneys initrusted to them
at the times and in the manner requiree
by la'v will, in every instne, tearrinate
the oflicial connexion of such .defaulin-g
officer with the government.
Although, -in our coutitry, the chief
magistrate must almost of necessity be
chosen by a party, and stand pleilged to'
its principles and measures,'yet in his offi
t cial action, he should not be the President
of a part only, but of the whole peopLe of
the United States. While he executes the
laws with animpartial hand, shrinks. from
no proper responsibility, and faithfully

No one, gentlemen, can appreciat'e mare It
highly or recog'nise inore'delerentially than W
does the incumbent of this chair the pow- w

Senate of the United States. To main
tain .these unimpaired and unrelaxed he
feels to be an official duty, second in im- l
pressive obligntion only to his consiitd-di
tional allegiance. To their exercise the
Republic owes incalculable good, and il
through them has been gradually achieved .
a wide-spread fame for wisdom, justice. 'n
moderation, and efficiency, unsurpassed Ci
by any assemblage of si snet in fortner Ii
-or piresent times. A calm and *ejl ad, RI
justed system of action in thik Chamber.
carefully devised and steadily pursued by
those who have preceded us in it, has in-- of'

it is with deep regret that I inform you w
that Gen. Almonte, the Mexican Minister.
is only waiting for President Tyler to
sign the Texas Annexatiotn Resolutiotus, iS
and to make the usual proc'lama tiont. which pa
will soon be dlone, to demand his pass ports w
and snake his protest, and to retire and ti
breake up all ojicial relations tl the Gotv- si
ernment of the United Ssates. ' .Gi
Desp-atchies were forwvarded by the le
Mexican delegation yesterday, by express','
to New Orleanis, to be sent to the city of be
Mexico informing the Goirernment of the er
passage of the Texan kesolutious.- s
Private letters from the highest soutces fat
from that city, state that the instant the
intelligence is receited there, the Govern
ment of Mexigco will declare war and issue eli
letters of miarque and reprisal.
Letters also received from Mexico of the -,
latest date, state that the prostration 'ofOt
Santa Anna has reconciled. all parties,
arid that.the most influential men of both Bi
sections are opposed to the Cabinet, that Di
Santa Anna wvill not be executed, hut that Pt
he- wtll be banished. and.that e will re- C
tire to the Islands of Cuba.
It. is represented that the greatest en- Al
thusiasm prevails. both with the people D
and the Government, that Texas shall tnt Ci
be touched b~y the United States, and on W
this question all parties are agreed and Jo
united. -Ft
Gen. Almonte has been dangerously ill,
and is still cotnfitned to his house.. He will
leave the city as sotm as his health will
Ipermit, propably within five days, for N.

ill not forget him, but will make his heart

stleof the bank bills as they deposit them in

e printer of the Advertiser, has put in good
pair his old. greaey wallet, pd has boreoed
Dapacions, leather pocket book, in which he
n store away all the money that his friends
ill give him. Never'fear, good friends, that
s-wallet or. pocket book will be filled tore

I'ns~ Moxtr.y Ros.--We have been ~fa
red with the pertusal of the January and
bruary ntumbers of the "Monthly Rose, a
r iodical sustained by the present and former
uiibcrs of the Albany Femle Academy."
i. periodical is exceedingly neat in its typo.
phhical executioh, and its .literary matter is
y creditable to the contributors. Several of
tirticles would reflect honor upon older and
re experienced wvriters. Among other po
effusions, will be found in the second numa
, one entitled "Jlloa." founded upon an- In
n tradition, of which an account is given-in
ook called "A year in the Prairies." This
le poem, is choice in its-dicuion,and has a
sical flow in -its metre, which is pleasing
the ear. Periodicals of a character' like the
ve, must piroduce: we ihiink,.a beneficial et.
.t upon the contributors its well as' the read
'rhey serve to expand the- mind and to
ng into action, the faculties of those who are
paring to play their' parts on life's great
;e. We are not amonig them who believe
t devotion to literary pursuits, iwhen united
gond cuommion sense, will prove injuriouas to
mian. We think that a certain degree ofCat
tion paDid to literature, :will not nfit a lady
thie ordiniary and useful avocations of life,
uties to her, as well as to one of the sterner
wvill be a delightfnl solace in the many

ness which she is too often called to drink.d
e would be pleased to see a periodical some
iat resembling the "Monthly Rose," pub.
ted in our olvn State. We know that there
among. our ladies sufficient talent for this
rpose. We- think that public patronage
auld be sufficietnt to sustain a peuiodical of
a character in one of our cities. Some years
ce, "The 'Rose," under' the cared'f Mrs.
man, one of' our most gifted ladies in Char
ton, charmed us with its aweeiness and its
tuty. -It has ceased to bloom, and ha. with
d away. But may we not see another Gewer'
ring up in our soil, and, difue its 6'rgrance -
and wide in our State.
