Fr m l!ie survivors of the passengers
who cmbaiAtd in t&is ill-fated vessel, we
have learned the flowing particulars.
'File i%ftomz" left New York at 4 o'clock,
P. M., on Saturday, the 7t? instant. Owing
to inexcusable eurelesuess, or u wan. of
knowledge of'Uie navigation, she was run
on toe Middle ground, abreast of Sandy
Hook, wncreshc rciivdunniJour hours, when
the rising tidy floated her ott. A her this
detention she pursued her voyage nil Monday
morning Without any further disaster.
On that morning it began to blow fresh, and
die sea became rough, or in nautical phrase,
"heavy." Tne unusual creaking of the* limbers,
uud straining of the frail vessel, soon
excited alarm a:no:jg the passengers, and
amo:.-/tlte res, two experienced sea Captains,
from Portsmouth, New Hampshire,
became alarmed ior their safety. As the
day advanced the sea became more rough,
the wind turned :o a g tie, and consternation
prevaded among those on board especially
among ti .e Ladies. A request was made
toCupain Wnite to beach" the vessel betore
night should come on as the only means
of escape which hope pointed out. He re
iinifT !ic u?? irt' mf7,riTHiL that Mr.
luawu, , ...
Ailairc, the owner, had informed him that
the *kHome" was not insured, that he was
determined therefore to save the vessel, that
she was new, well-built and capable of
weathering Cape flattens, when the danger
would be over. About this time the alarming
informal.on was given that the vessel
ha drungal speak. Captain Salter, a passenger,
who wxs then (with the consent of
Capt. White) in command ef the ' Home
set all hands to pumping ami b tiling- The
leak increased rapidly, and although a 1 the
passengers, tie' Ladies included, assisted in
the labour, the wat?r poured through the i
rent sides of the devoted vessel in such torrents
that all their efforts were unavailing.
The person, in command had by this time
thought it advisable to make for the nearest
land, and the course was altered accordingly.
In a very short timeaf.er,when yet fif
miles of Cape Hatteras, the watei in the
'he vessel had risen so high that the fires
were extinguished by it,<fethe machinery was
Ltonscquently useless. Two sail were now !
the only means by which the shore could be
reached,one of whichwas blown aw ay almost
as soon as it was s? t Under the remaining
one the boat aproached the land,At was kept
ifioat with difficulty,by incessant labour. It
ivas now nigh:,Ac the gale cotinntied. Previous
to s'riking the beach,Capt. Salter requested
the Ladies to leave ihe afier part of
lie boat Sf go ''forward,"believing that their
orospect of escape would b ? better there,
should s' e run "head on," as wasexpecied.
Tne awful moment was at hand !?terror

it to resignation. It came! the keel

twen y bodies had been found, and we have sti
since learned that a per ion of the cabin aj
which was driven on shore after their de- / ?
er
par.nre, contained the lifeless remains of
fourteen ladies and one ehiid !
A general regret prevails among the sur- CL
vivors the cheif ma;e of the "Home," (whose | pe
name we believe was Matthews) should have j
perished uf.er tne noble exertions he made
to save riie vessel. M my ofihem express, \v
tfieir belief that "she would have been sa. fn
ved; had Mr. Ma:thevv9 been incommand4?k|t
Such expressions led to the suspicion of] .
ineffi i-ncy or misconduct oh the part of!tK
Capr. W7nite, & when questioned on the sub. [ "
jert the passengers unhesitatingly charged i da
him with being the probable cause of the w
dreadful loss of life, b\ his rejection ofadvice ar
an I by his obstinately keeping the vessel at
sea alter those on board had ascertained ^ L
lh:U she was unfit for the voyage, instead of j
selecting the safest landing place before the i
night came on. They attribute the disas- ;
ter cheifly to wo causes,?*'the incompe. j
tency, artificially produced," of Capt. j in
White; and the insufficiency of the vessel | \\
for ocean navigation in rough weather." ! p(
It is painful to us to have ar agency in i c(.
thus pubhshiug so neavy a charge against j
the Captain, but it is a duty whic i we feel t
bound toezecute for the general good. Too j di
many lives have been sacrificed within a !d;
few years by the imprudence, negligence j ^
and inebriety of commands of steam boats ,
ami ifihere be no penalty incurred by such j
dreadful occurrences it is time that the I p.
public should cease to risk their safety n ,
such hands.

THE DISSECTED ALIVE.
An Italian journal relates an extraordinary
incident connected with the recent death of
one of the Roman Cardinals. In consequence
of extreme grief, Cardinal Sommaslia had fallen
ill. He had a syncope, was believed to
be dead, and his servants hastened to have the
body opened and embalmed before putrefaction.
The surgeon's knife had penetrated to
to the lungs, when'the Cardinal's heart was
perceived still to beat. He recovered animation
at the moment, and had force enough to
repel with his hand the knife of the surgeon.
It was too late: the wound was mortal.
