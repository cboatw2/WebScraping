The Southi rn Agriculturist, at the request
of several Agricultural societies, invites tho
plauters of the several parishes in this iTate
and the several Agricultural societies, to appoint
delegates to a convention in Columbia,
during the first week of the session of the State
Legislature.
We have received from the publishers,
Emerson's Arithmetic, Fust Part. It is tntcn.
ded for children, to whose capaci'y we consider
it better adapted t.;an any other work oftne
kind we have seen. It ha? for s.?mo time, we
believe, been used in the Academies iu this
town. Teachers who have not seen it, would
do well to procure a copy and examine it.
A fellow* who was the editor of a vile and
1 ^ ^ /**!r lin^n
m'osi scurrilous pap m iie? ?w?
sentenced to six months' confinement in the
Penitentiary at hard labor, for a libel upon the
Rev. Dr. Hawkes of the Episcopal Church.?
The fellow had no defence to make, but plead
guilty to the indictment. The sentence ought
to have been six years instead of six months.
For 6ome time past the papers of the Northern
cities have teemed ivith complaints of the
high price of beef. It was once as high in the
N York market as 27 cents per pound.' Meetings
were held in some places and the butchers
denounced for an alleged combination to keep
up the price, and resolutions were passed not
to buy from them till the price, should fall.?
The price kept up notwithstanding, and all in
market was readily sold. The butchers now,
in their turn, are holding meetings, charging
the high prices to "combination" among tne
graziers throughout the country, and passing
* birrhnr nfiro
resolutions not to ouy ucev L'C ai a ingiivi |
than ten dollars per hundred. Just as ration- i
ally might the manufacturer- harge the pres.!
ent high price of cotton to a combination J
among the planters. The high price of meats ;
throughout the country for the last few years i
is to be ascribed chiefly, if not solely, to the
xtension of cotton planting, and to the practice
of buying all their meat which prevails
among a arge proportion of the cotton growers.
Mississippi and Alabama are now reap- j
ing, in part, the fruit o! this policy, and so also !
are the live stock growers; though the fruit j
in the one case is a little different from what |
it is in the other.

The Baptist Advocate.?This is the title of;
a new j>aper lately issued in New York, it |
is edited by Wm. H. Wycoff, A. M. and is
recommended to the surport of the Denomina-;
tion by the Baptist clergy of that city. The j
New York Courier and Enquirer says; 4*lt i
presents a beautiful specimen of typography
and is evidently conducted with talent and
zeal ?'
It seems stilJ to be a mooted point by the
newspapers whether the "fatal duel" sometime
since announced as having occuired
between Mi. Jo. SeaweU Jones and a Mr.
Wilson a vvine-dealer of New York a'ocut the
borders of N. Carolina and Virginia did ever
occur. The reason a#aign;u for disbelieving
* ?e o rlnol .a thaf nn nno has
lilt* fUlIlUUf l? autu u www
been fonnd who saw the dead body of Mr
Wilson, ('an any be found who lias seen his
living body since the date of the alleged duel?
Merited Punishment While General
Porter of Pennsylvania was a candidate for
the office of Governor, he was accused of
perjury. After the election a publisher of the
slander was indicted for libel, of which he has
now been found guilty. Sonne persons seem to
think that when a man is a candidate for office
any thing may be said of him w.th impunity.
A few instances like this, especially if the
' convictions were followed by fine and imprisonment,
as they ou^ht to be, would teach j
such persons a salutary lesson.
New York Semi- Weekly Whig.?This j
paper, the prospectus of which we lately copied I
has been issued. The first No. is!
before us, and fully equals the promise of the j
prospectus. We copy the following notice of.'
the Editors.
THE SEMI-WEEKLY WI1IG.
The first number of the Semi-Weekly eui- j
tion of the New York Wh/g is herewith submitted
to the public. It will be regularly published
henceforth every Wednesday and Saturday
afternoons, on a sheet of the size of the
Timln vVlnrr and half the size of the Weekly,
and forwarded by the carkst mii s to its Pat.
rons. It will contain al! the ma'ter of the Daily
Whig except the Advertisements, and bo afforded
at the low price of Three Dollars per
annun. in advance. It is believed that this is
the cheapest Semi-Weekly paper in the country.
The character of the New York Whig?
Daily and Weeekly?is now widely known.
It ' as been published about sixteen months,
and in that brief period has acquired an ex.
tensive circulation, and, we trust, a fair standing
among its cotemporaries. 11 aims to present
in a medium sheet an amount of reading
matter lully equal to the average of the Great
Dailies of New Ycrk and our other Commercial
cities. Its contents will comprise Litera-ture,
Politics and General Intelligence, in
about equal proportions. I n the Literary Dedartment,
no great pretensions are made to
originality, but the best re ositories of i orei n
and American Literature are open to its conductors,
and they endeavor toselect therefrom
a varied and interesting banquet. In General
I n'diligence, we hope to be nci'her behind nor
inferior to our immediate cotemporar es. In
Folitics, our journal will be all that its name
purports?fearlessly, zealously, and we fctrnsi
efficiently, Whig. Experienced pens arc enlisted
in its service, and we trust it will render
good service to the Countrv in the ouvocacy
of Sound Principles and Good Measures
and the fearless exposure of the iniquitu??,
corruptions and ruinous tendencies of Loco- j
Fscoism.

Mr. Editor :
To my surprise I have heard men of 1
say, That Gen. Jackson had done more r
harm to the country than lie has cvet in 1
whole course of his life done good, and cc
plain most bitterly that he has turned out
office his Political opponents which they c
proscription. Removals from officp, ten
proscription by many, have occasioned mi
excitement, and no little dissatisfaction.
Proscription in its present perverted acc
tation means as well the exclusion of politi
enemies from the honors and offices of I
Government, as the removal of them af
they have bceiijinducted i.ito office. The pol
of their exclusion however strongly reprobai
by some, appears tome to be founded on cc
mori sense and justice, ani has been practi
by every majority under every administral
m A. A
since the formation ot our government n
where, I would ask, is the moral wren
Where is the injustice of the President's
po uting to ofP.ce fnen Js whose views accwith
his own on all the great measures ca!
lated to maintain the interest of the peo
and to advance the honor and Glory of
country, in preference to political opponei
who, however honest and capable, mij
embarras and thwart every act of the A
ministration ? I must confess that I can f
none. If, IndecJ there was a dearth c-f tale
?if honest, faithful and capable men co
not be had in the majority to fill every off
in the government, then the public good wo
require that they should be taken from
ranks of the minority. But such a state
things ha3 never occured, and probably v
never occur.
From the great clamor raised agai
proscription lmny persons are le 1 to belli
that the policy ?ef removing pol tical enem
from office was first introduced and practis
by Gen. Jackson, when it is a well kno
fact that a majority of the states, includi
our axon, practiced the same policy m:
years ago. At the session of 1799, the J
gislature of Virginia removed from office ev<
man but with one exception, who had ^op
sed the election of .Mr. Jefferson. jTh ? peri
excepted was Mr. Sheppcrd, the Auditor,
gentleman distinguished as w 11 for
amiable simplicity of manners, as for t
fidelity and ability with which he discharg
the duties of his office. lie had taken no oti
part in the election than barely to gtve
vote for Mr. Adams, and was permitted
continue in office. It i9 well to recur to th<
times, and to freshen the memories of so
gentlemen among us, who in reproo.umg
strongly proscription and misrule, forget tl
in 1799 they voted for every removal, down
a door keeper.
Those who condemn the present Admit
tratiop. for making removals from office, s
laud the former ones for their great forbe
ance, do not sufficiently consider the pecu.
circumstances under which each catne i
power. Mr.. ohn Adams, Mr. Madison, 1
Munroe, and Mr. John Q. Adams, were e:
the friend of his predecessor in office, i
supported and defended the measures of
Administration; c-'^pqe'v.ti;-, n^rly a!l
cd offices under Government were filled by their
he political friends. Not so with Mr."Jefferson j
he and Gen. Jackson. They came into power
upon a political revo'ulion, and found almost c
D. aH the offices filled with their political ene" v
nit mies; many of them violent partisans, who
resorted to foal and disreputable means to dea
feat their elections.
p
Mr. Jefferson was assailed with great j e
xr< violenco from Maine to Georgia, by all the i p
presses opposed to his election. The press j
ed, the most reckless in its attack was conducted j c
|e(] by the celebrated William Cobbet, who j v
of wrote under tiie signature of Peter Porcu-1
pine. The vilest calumnies, the hagest slan- ?
lat ders ng-sinst the character of Mr. Jefferson,
ire with much neighborhood scandalous gossip ^
re. > trash, were collected and published in that h
notorious paper. When Mr. Jefferson came
lat into power independent of removals for other a
he causes he dismissed from office every man ^
in who had patronized or coi ntenanced Porcure.
pine's Gazette. With equal malignaty and j
tee acrimonious bifternes did many of the admin- a
A\ istration papers attack the character of Gen. ^
Jackson, pending the Presidential electicn.?
ed, The presses sent forth all sorts of false, scanrc
dalous and malicious charges against him in f
;ty public newspapers, pamphlets, .and coffin
'lit handbil.s. Not content with the foul means t
ng i employed to tarnish his honest fame, men of ij
the elevated standing in society debased themrk
6 elves by their dust&rd1)' attempt to traduce t
Llie the character of his wife ; not eo much, I y
or believe, to disparage her on the eyes of her fi
own sex, as to wound ihe feelings of her fond a
be and affectionate husband That Gen. Jac^
v
isr son should have noticed with marked repreve
hension, and removed from office the authors j,
er- and abettor of these slanders, is not to be a
wandered at. It was an act for which the ?
ee> most fastidious of those opposed to proscription 11
could not blame him. .
on | I am no advocate for removals, except for t
J a good cause. I certain.y would not remove I
F. from office a political opponent solely to make v
room for a political friend; nor do I mean 1
1 a to condemn the policy of removals, for it
it seems to be mere matter of opinion. A ?

I by continuing in office so many of his politcul t

office for an honest and independent exercise j
of the elective franchise. It would be for the t
