We take the following account of the j
recent College Exhibition in Columbia
from the Temperance Advocate?and are
absolutely horrified at our friend's want
of gallantry.
TUB COLLEGE EXHIBITION.
Our readers will find below a programme
of the exercises. We attended the
first night, and was pleased to see the
Chapel crowded?the Ladies?

' man,
constituting a large and far the most j
lovely portion of the audience. We
s iould rather say sjycctotors, for there:
was really no audience, if that word is Herived
from the Latin, audio, to hear. Be ;

mai as 11 may, ine lauies were mere in
beautiful abundance, but
' Oh u:hal u rote, what a racket and a rioting"
some of those nimblc-tongued damsels did
make; aided and abetted?and but for i
the incredibility of the thing, we should j
say, surpassed?by divers nondescripts

line, flowing tresses and feminine tongues
might lead one to imagine that they were
Tcally girls, dressed up in breeches, who
had gone down there to playoff*a pleas.ant

for we verily believe that fully half

to the speakers themselves, and those
of the Faculty, who had read them be-1

the "ears polite ot those who went to see
and talk, but not to hear.
We except, however, the J4atin speech,
to which the ladies really listened with i
profound attention.
We would respectfully suggest to the j
faculty to have all tho speeches in the
Romana at these Exhibitions, for
it has all the charm of a secret to Eve's

The case of McLeod.?This case wa
called on Monday morning May 17tl
before the Supreme Court of the State o
New York, before which court the prison
er was brought in obedience to a writ o
Habeas Corjms.
Mr. Bradley of Counsel for McLeod
read the Sheriffs return to the writ, sta
ting that the Sheriff held the body o
A. McLcod in custody by order of tlx
Oyer and Terminer bearing date Marcl
30th, 1841 on the arraignment of McLeoi

custody on a writ of capias ad satisfuctien

action of trespass for burning and carrying
a certain steamboat named the Carolini
for which he had laid his damages a
$50,000, and that the writ contained ai
order that he should be held to bail iri tin
j sum of $7,000.
The civil suit against McLeod ha
been discontinued. The Prisoner's coun
sol then read an Affidavit of McLeod
which states the facts with regard to tin
occupation of Navy Island by a body o
men composed principally of citizens o
the United States, having designs hostili

of the public military authorities of Grca
Britain, in Canada?that J)urfce, th<
person with whose murder the prisoner i
charged, was killed, by the persons en
gaged in executing this order, and whili
so engaged, that the Government of Grea
Britain lias assumed as its own the act o
destroying the Boat with the killing o
said Durfee, and that the Federal Govern

' i r?
Affidavit further states tint McLeod wa
nut trfle of tho corppany that destroyei
J|je Caroline, nor was any w ay coricerne<
in tint (ipt 9r in the killing of Durfee.
The prisoner's counsel then read va
\ s
. ridus public documents to sustain the ill* i
r legations of the Affidavits. 1
i When the counsel for the prisoner had
r read aty the papers he considered necessa- J
* fy, Mr. Wood, of coilnsel for the people,
? stated the grounds of the demurr, which (
f are as follows.
1. Because the attack on the siteftmbout
? Caroline, a boat owned by a citizen of the 1
> United States, unconnected with the In- 1
r surgents of Navy Island, and navigating ,
? the waters of the Niagara river, under a
license from the United States government,
and engaged for aught that appears
in a legal business, was made whilst she " (
was moored at Schlosser, in the State of (
3 New York, and without the jurisdiction
j of the Province of Upper Canada,
j 2. Because, neither the Governor of
3 Upper Canada nor Col. Allan McNab
j had any right, power or authority to send
r men into this State to destroy the boat; j
j and all those acting under such unlawful (
orders are individually responsible for
oe to
J liivu uvio?
3. Because AmosDurfee, for themurtier
of whom the prisoner stands indicted,
, was a peacabie citizen of the United
States, and within the jurisdiction of this
. State, unconnected with the insurgents
f # O (
on Navy Island, guilty of no offence a.
j gainst the laws of this State or of the
United States, nor against the rights of
Great Britain and was killed upon the j
main land in this State, after having left (
the boat and flying unarmed an 1 unresisting
from the assailants, after tliey were in j
possession of the boat; and the assault
upon whom the prisoner was neither directly
or necessarily connected with the
destruction of the Caroline, was necessary
to the defence of the territories of Great
Britain nor the protection of he * subjects.
4. Because the matters set forth in the
allegations of the prisoner do not tend to
establish that the prisoner was exempt from
the arrest, nor that the commitment or
detention are or have been illegal, but
that the same, so far as they are pertinent
to the issue between the people and the
prisoner apply exclusively to the question
of hisguilt or innocence, which is not
now before the court.
5. Because it appears by the Sheriffs
return that the prisoner is imprisoned and
detained on an indictment of murder to
which he has pleaded not guilty, and the
court cannot investigate the truth of such !
indictment or plea.
Mr. Hall then informed the Court that
as he had not expected the question on
the discharge of the prisoner to come up
this morning and was not pre pared on the
general merits of the case. He therefore
requested until this morning for time to
more particularly examine the question.
The further hearing of the case was
then adjourned to this morning.
The following are the points madq for
the prisoner-on the Habeas Corpus.
The attack and destruction of the Caroline
was an act of Dublic force done by
?
the command of the British Government.
All that the prisoner did in it, if any thing
he did by command of his superior officer
and in obedience to his own government.
For acts done under such authority he is
not responsible personally or indiv idually
in any court of law whatever.
2. The Supreme Court has jurisdiction
to try the offence charged in the indictment
and may order it to be tried at bur.
' It has jurisdiction therefore to give advice
and grant leave to the District Attorney,
to order a nolle prosequi upon the indictment.
3. The right to enter such nolle prosequi
previous to the enactment of the revised
statutes, was alone vested in the
District Attorney, or Attorny General, i
It was then and now the exercise of the
executive power of the government ins
fluenced by considerations of sound policy
' and wise expediency. The same reasons
p, which would induce the law officer of the
J government to interpose to prevent a trial
' j ought to and will induce the Court toad*
vice emd allow the same tiring to be done.
4. Redress for this forcible and hostile
? invasion of the territory of the U. S., the
-1 destruction of property and the killing of
f our citizens, was at an early day demand3
ed of the British government of the Uni]
ted States, and the whole matter is still
- - ' .... ..i
j | in the course oF treaty between mem, i
I j with a view to a full and just settlement.
_! The State of New York therefore cannot
II discreetly or lawfully interpose its jurisJ
diction and take cognizance of any por3
tion of this public offence against the en- j
tire American nation. It is the exercise I
1 of an authority by the State repugnant to |
1 the constitution and laws of the U. S. and 1
B brings the two jurisdictions in collision
and conflict. Its tendency is to thwart
s the constitutional exercise of the treaty
- making power of the U. S., and thus inI,
volve the two countries in war.
e j 5. By the constitution* of the U. S. the
" * ? -? nnnnlmln n/iOXO I
ij power lO UCOiuiu rrui, tuutiuvii; ^ uu?1
f and generally to superintend the foreign
c relations of our country, belongs to Couj
gress or the general government.
The act in which McLeod. is alleged
to have participated heing ail exercise of
the public force of Great Bri :ain, and of
a hosiile character, becomes the subject of
r reclaminalion, reprisal and war on the
1 part of the government of the United
e States, as it shall see fit ; or it may dc-1
s mand acknowledgment, reparation or in
demnity for the offence and injury and
e thereupon acknowledge itself satisfied,
t Any interference of the State authority
f will be and is incompatible with the exf
ercise of these high powers.
6. If the alleged offence were cognizable
by the Courts of the United States,
the trial of the individual would be wholly
incompatible with the pending negotiaS
lions between the two govern merits, and
2 alike unworthy of the honor and dignity
^ of both.
7. Had the attack been made upon a
^ port or an arsenal, in the District of Columbia
or other place within in the juris.
* diction of the Courts of the United States
itid an indictment had been found in
lUCli Court, the ground of discharge
would hdte been the same then as now.
[f then the United States Courts ought to
forbear to persecute the individuals, so
ought noxc the State of New York.
8. The foregoing are believed to be
the sound views of the subject and tot lisfactorily
show that this Court should (lis.
charge the prisoner.
Correspondence of the Journal of Commerce.
Philadelphia, May 17,1841.
We have had a dry, warm and very
windy day, and up to about three o'clock
most excessively dusty. There was at
that time rain enough to allay the dust
when the sun again shone out.
The trial of Doctor Eldrige was again
for some cause or other postponed.?*
Whether our Court will remain in bsirig
long enough to see the end of this vexatious
case is now growing very questionable.
Sarah Ann .Davis was this morning sentenced
bv JUlitfe Hnrfnn tn he huncr for
j ? ? n
the murder of Juliana Jordan. There
was an immense crowd of persons gathered
in and round the court room, and so
completely filled up was the passage leading
to it that it was found necessary to
take the prisoner in at the window from
the carriage in which she was brought
from the prison. Judge Barton's remarks
to the prisoner previous to passing the
sentence were quite eloquent, but the unhappy
object of them moved not a muscle
during their delivery, and not until
the last words of the awful sentence fell
from his lips did s|ie yield to her feelings.
She then fainted, and was thus, uncon.
scious, carried to an adjoining office where
she suffered many similar spasms, and
wept without stint or remorse. Her husband,
uuder arrest on a similar charge
was by her side and exhibited great mental
agony.
Tbis is the second capital sentence passed
upon a woman since the American revolution?and
but two female executions
are within the oldest recollection. The
first, while Pennsylvania was a province,
was at Chester. The brother of the vietim
upon that occasion had succeeded
in obtaining her pardon from the Executive
Council, but failed to roach the place
of execution before she was swung off.
The second was that of a young German
femaiie, near Germantown, for the murder
of two of hei own children, a great many
years ago. It is very doubtful whether
the third female execution will ever take
place in Pennsylvania. Capital punish,
ment is growing into disrepute, and especially
towards women.

It may not be improper for me to add
here that the rumor so industriously propagated,
representing Gen. Jackon's estate
as insolvent, is entirely unfounded. From
my personal knowledge ot his pecuniary
affairs, I can say with confidence, if he
was called upon to-morrow to close his

$100,0110. would not diminish a fraction.

SUMMARY.
MARRIAGE.
When a man of sense comes to marry,
it is a companion whom he wants, and not
an artist. It is not merely a creature
who can paint, play, dress and dance?
it is a being who can comfort and console
him.
A Mr. Howell, of Cumberland, Mary
land, whose father was a passenger on
board the President, received by the Brittannia,
a letter from a relative who resides
in Southampton, England, dated
April 19th, stating that the President had
arrived at Madeira: that Mrs. Power, the
wife of Tyrone Power, had just received
by Express, information to that effect.
This is the most hopeful account yet received.
