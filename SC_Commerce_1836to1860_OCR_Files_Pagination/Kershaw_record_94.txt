Tney serve to All op blanks;
'Bat shopld not oyster-like be seen
Gaping for e'er on Banks.
No ! though the loveliest pearl lies hid
Within its silver shell;
Must they unolose the glittering lid
To free it Irom its cell ?
My lip with indignation curled,
When I the mandate heard ;
For Bank quakes that convulsed the world,
Castalian's stream had stirred.
And shall the mound of prejudice
Stein the poetic tide ?
And classic eddies thus compress
To fortify man's pride.
Rather let verse like Nilus rise
Its tribute to bestow ;
And sterile Banks to fertilize
With periodic flow.
1 vow to Specie's paper-agents
I mean no saucy detriment,
By ranking them in Mammon's pageants,
With Pallstaflf's ragged regiment.
For credit finds in such recruits
Support as staunch and loyal,
As it they wore untarnished suits,
Adorned with trappings royal.
But inobs are like Macbeth the Thane,
From Sable Cape to Blanco;
And selfish interests to maintain,
Would sacriiice a Bank o !
No Caledonian crown indeed
Arouses their cupidity ;
For Carolina's coin they plead
Secure of its validity.
But revolutionary forms
Mutmnies in memory's balm ;
Arise amid commercial storms,
Their violence to calm.
Around the vaults with grief profound
Each apparition lingers ;
Pointing to currency's deep wound
With cautionary fingcis.
The times these spectres now evoke
To aid Bank-conversation,
Evade at once the threatened stroke
Of dread depreciation. i

THE success of the SOUTHERN TONIC is
unprecedented, it has been anxiously sought
after by all persons in every part of the United
States, and its widely extended distribution has
been owing to the many requests received from
every section of the South and South West. Although
it originated in an obscure purl, of the country
but a few years since, it is now found in all the
principal towns and villages in the Union, and its
virtues as a cure for Ague and Fever, and as a
general Tonic, are appreciated by all who have .
used it. Being as it professes a compound of
Southern Vegetables, it is needless to offer the assurance
that there is no Arsenic, Mercury, nor any
iinng in the least hurtful to the human constitu- ,
tion in it. It will be found a valuable Medicine
in all cases of Dyspepsia and disorganised Stomach ,
and iioivels, and patients convalescing from I*il- j
lious Fever, will derive the most important bene- j
tits from the use of the Southern Tonic. It may ,
be administered to children and infants of the most
tender age with the utmost safety. Prepared by

been solicited by agents and Venders to postpone
the drawing of the above schemp, for a short time, J

We have therefore yielded to these solicitations,

made double, they reduce labor, and gin just f
lonble, the quantity of cotton over the single cylin- r
ler Gin, no other knd having been in use previous |
o this patent ; and whether single or double, they |
ire found to improve the quality of the cotton, by ?
nore perfectly cleaning it. They can be made to
contain from 20 to iOOsaws in a stand, and wlu%ier
imall or large, one hand will be sufficient to attend
lieut.* i We' i}ZV*' meuuhnicai icruVrs and 1
toppers attached to them, which free the cotton
rom leaves, trash, dirt, ?Vc. before it can reach the
aws, and by the thorough hackling operation it
eceives troin the feeders, which make two revoi)lions
to one of the saws, it is almost in a ball I
jined state, before it descends to the saw ily a
rery simple arrangement of a screw to each set of
Mates, . 11 which the hoppers rest. and through
vhicli the teeth of the feeders pass, thev can be I
nade to feed slow or fast to suit the condition of
h?* cotton at the lime. When made double, the
aws are placd on two sets of cylinders and turn f
ipon each other in opposite directions, and arc
ileansed by two sets ol brushes that have lour revo. f

ic detached so as to enable the planter to run one

vith a drum and hand, as in the ordinary Gin, and
nay be propelled by horse, steam, or water power. I
t may also be propelled by iron running gear.
The force required to work it, is about the same as I
hat necessary to move an equal number of saws in

iperation in New Orleans for two or three weeks, }
md its success tested in the presence of n large I
lumber of planters, merchants and others, and a
'eceived their general approbation. J c
Several gentlemen bavp been so kind as to give i i

what I think of your improved (Cotton Gin, I have
to say, that I saw it work on Saturday the2"?th inst. t
anil was very much pleased with its performance, i
The mere fact of its self-feeding, scorns to me to i
be a very xaluable improvement; and besides, the t
quality of the cotton, as it comes out of the pro- i

from the common Gins in use, and that it saves j <

Dr. A. Jo* es?Dear Sir, in answci tc your inquiry
of my opinion of your Patent Cotton Gin, I
licg leave to state, that J was fifteen years cngn i-d
in the cotton factories of Manchester, Kngand,
and during four years of that time, 1 was
foreman in the house of Messrs. Lewis, Williams
Kr Co., and near five years spinner in the house of
Messrs. Sand ford <Xr Gnene. I have seen your
Cotton Gin in operation, and have ? xnmined the
sol ton ginned by it, and pronounce it better cleanu*d.
and the steplc less iniured. than any cotton
that ever came under my observation. It is completely
ready for the breaker without the aid ol the
lilower, and would, therefore, save the first pr< cess
in manufacturing the article. 1 consider cotton
sleansed by your Gin, would command from one
to two coots on the pound n.orc than the nvr inge
:rops brought into the Manchester n ail'.et. and
cleansed by conitnon Gins Yours, very jesp'Iy.

It is desirable, when planters give ordeis for Gins,
ihey should accompany them with their views in
regard to the arrangement of saws, breasts, brush's,
&e. It is found they differ in opinion. Some
fiesire saws of larger diameter than others. T he
most eornmon size is 0 or 10 inches ; but some wish
lliem 112 inches. Some wish 5 or (5 rows of brushes
on an axle, while others do not want more than 4
at most Some wish saws with 8 or 9 teeth to the
inch."while others want 10 or 11. YS ith so much
discrepancy, we prefer they should, at the lime of
giving orders, lurnish a statement of their wishes,
and the inanufacturcrers can fulfil thrni in every
particular. Where it is left to our discretion, v o
shall make them on the most modern and approved
plan. An order can be executed^ from the time it
is received, in the space of eight or nine we? ks,
and the Gin in that time placed in ?he hands of the
factor. To be in time for the next crop, all orders
ought to be in the hands of the manufacturers hy
the first or middle of May ; except for plantations
where they are late in commencing to pick or gin
cotton.
