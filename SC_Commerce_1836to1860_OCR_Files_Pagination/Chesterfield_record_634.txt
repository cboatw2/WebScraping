It wi I be seen from this pedigree that hi
most of the very best crosses of which this si
country can boast, meet in Car lina Eclipse, j tf
Although more racers, a;e not tne horses B
for the fanner, yet it is admitted by all that j w
racing is a fair trial of the strength, bottom ;
and cons itution n| a horse. It is therefore , it
tated tiiat Festival, the sire of Carolina !
Eclipse, though on'y a short time on the turf, i of
listinguisfieu himself in these respects at all d<
distances from two to four mile heats. In his j
first race at Nottoway Va. in the spr.ng of fu
two mile heats, he distanced Ins compe- j
litor the second heat. In the fall of the same ,
year, at Milledgville, Ga. three mile heats, j N
lie easily won the Jockey Club purse, in two j
heats. The same season, at Lexington, Ga. j
iii a race f?r the Ciub. purse, three m;le heals, t
while leadng his competitors his rider suf. j -?
"en d him to run too near the rim of the inside | J
track, against which he stumbled and fell, j jJ(
causing h?m to lose tiie race. The same week ^
at the same place he beat all his riva s in 3 a
mile heats, the best 3 in 5. The next spring, j
at Lawrenceviile, Va. he ran four mile heats,! B
with Ironette, Anvil, Row-Galley, and Walter : ih
Conk. Although he was in bad condition, j p'
having not fatly recovered from the effects of, E
distemper, and owing to his rider being sick, 11
he was obliged to carry 5 lb. over weight, he t0
lost the first heat only by the neck, and the i
second by only a few feet, Ironette icadmg j
him; Kow.Gdlhy and Walter distanced, and ; Anvil
(aftcrwaids sold f >r ?10 000) barely
saving h;s distance. At New Market, Va. i
the next season, he started with eleven other T
horse , and !en t mm all the first heat. But j J
his feet being tender from a recent founder, he Pl
was then withdrawn. Two weeks aher-1
ward", his feet yet sore, he was barely beaten 1
by the fine racer, Duke of Or eans, in four mile i
heats at Baltimore. His manager still, with i ~
