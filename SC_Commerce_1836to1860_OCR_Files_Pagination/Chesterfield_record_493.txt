Krratux.?In the account of the cul&c.
of three acres of upland cotton furnished
by Gen. Gillespie to the Pee Dee
Agricultural Society, and published i" our
columns last week, an important typographical
error occurred. The quantity
of manure spread on the three acres was
nine hundred bushels, and not three hundred,
as printed.
Medical College of the state of
South Carolina.
At the bte commencement in this inStitution
the degree of M. D. wasconfered
on 51 students, among them Alexander
M/.I.enn and Jon\ A. Hodges, of iWarl
borough, J. R. McQueen, of Marion, and
\V< S. Boyd and J. C. Haynkswortii
of Stouter. Of the graduates there were
41 front" South Carolina, 4 from North
Carolina, 4 from Alabama and 3 from
Georgia. The silver cup for the best
thesis was awarded to W. K. Kltx of
Orangeburg.
The trial of McLeod has been postponed
to another terra, in consequence of an error
by the clerk of the court jg drawing a
jp. jury, which prevents the holding of a court
for jury trials. Gen. Scott had gone on,
and made a requisition on the Governor of
New York for troops to protect McLeod
in case of his acquittal and discharge.?
The Governor had issued his orders accordingly.
But upon the receipt of information
that the trial would not now take
place, Gen. Scott withdrew his call for
troops.
Whilst the need for such a call speaks
unfavorably for the ch trader of a portion
of the people of New York, t he course of
the General Government ev inces a determination
on the part of those entrusted
with its administration, faithfully to discharge
their duty.
Adjutnnt# and Inspector General Jones
has resigned his office. The reason
assigned by him is that, owing to the
hnhtinn of the encain;>raent system by
the Legislature, he can be no longer |
useful in his office, and he could render
the state no service equivalent to his salary.
'He also expresses the opinion that
' the rejection by two successive L?gislatuWsofthe
bill proposed by the Bonn! of
office&appointed for that purpose in 1838,
is an evidence of the declining impor.
tance of the militia, in the estimation of
the Legislature.
Extraordinary preparations, were made
in the city of New York, by the political
friends of Mr. Van Buren to make a munificent
display on his reception in that
city qn his way home from Washington.
^ " But the elements defeated them. Rain fell
in torrents at the time of his arrival which
marred as well the pleasure of the actors
as the exhibition.
The personal attention shewn Mr. Van
Huron by his political party, togethe
with the fact of his not jKwitively declining
the rumination of the Missouri Legislature
and the declaration of influ

circles, would seem to point lo him s the
opposition cantli 'ate for the Prcsidenrv
at the next election.
- Lucernk.?We
have a small square of
this grass growing in our garden, from
the appearance of which we arc inclined
4o think favorably of it as a grass for soiling
or hay in our climate. Tiie soil is
-sandy with a sand foundation. It was
badly prepared, heing but thinly manured,
:ahd having had a coat several inches deep
" of vnrotted oak leaves turned in a few
weeks before the time of planting. But
lieing the only vacant spot in the garden
.at the time, we concluded to try it. After
spading up the ground to the depth of
twelve inches, the seed was drilled, early
in May, and came up well; but at least
half the plants, perhaps two thirds, were
destroyed a few days after they appeared
above ground, by a very small black
fly* Those which were left grew well, but
having on hand at the time a press of oth
business which more urgently demanled
our attention, they were not worked
till some time in June, when it was almost
concealed by a thick crop of crab grass.
' The growth was somewhat checked by
the disturbance of the roots in pulling and
cutting up this grass. It was hoed once
more during the season, but not till another
heavy crop of crab grass had at.
tained such growth as to require the hand
fitr pulling, rather than the hoc for cutting
it up. The lucerne with all these
disadvan ages grew to an average height
of from 10 to 15 inches. Or rather this
wis the length of the spears, which indined
to grow laterally and were bent towards
the ground by the weight oT their
loaves. Some bunches . bore seed, and
the whole would very well have borne
cutftnginthe fall. Tiicy continued green
till fcvere frost; and yoqng leaves l>egan
to spring up from th^ roots again late
in January. From that tipac they have
coniinued to grow, slowly in cold wcath-1
er, and more rapidly when the weather
was warm. The severe frost in February
killed some of the leaves, but none of the
spears. A week ago, when the peach
trees had blossomed, but had put forth no
leaves, the lucerne was from 8 to 11
inches high. Many of the spears are
now 17 inches long, and the whole prescnts
the most luxuriant and beautiful
grewthofdeep green and tender vegetation
which we have ever seen in March.
The only defect is that the stand is toe
thin. If the stand were good it would
now afford as heavy a crop of h ly as clover
affords at any season of the year, even on
strong soil. The spaces between the
beds were covered with a coat of stable
manure in February and spaded up.
From the result, thus far, of this experiment,
wo feel warranted in advising
a trial of lucerne by planters who have
sandy soil which they can manure. The
early part of September is considered the
l>est time for planting, and next to that,
mnntli PoKrimrv. If thr? season
1 lie; III'/II i II VI a. % VI UMI^ * ...w
had been a dry one our planting in May
last year would probably have proved a
failure. Several bunches died during a
short continuance of dry weather in some
part of the season, perhaps in August.?
This, however, may have been caused by
the quantity ofleavesstill unrotted in the
soil.
Lucerne is used chiefly, if not alto.
( gather for hay or soiling, that i?, cutting
' to feec. in a green state. Delicate lambs,
pigs and calves might be suffered to run
upon it for a short time, though not with!
out injury to the succeeding crop of hay.
j The roots penetrate deep into the soil,
j and continue to throw up a luxuriant
! growth of stems and leaves for 8 to lit
: years;?some accounts say, much longer,
j Though valuable, it cannot be used in a
; rotation of crops for the improvement of
i land. But to counterbalance this disad;
vantage, it requires neither replanting nor
j cultivation for a long scries of years after
J it has once taken good root. It must,
I however, be manured occasionally, as the
i growth begins to fail,
j Rabbits are very fond of it and injure
i it in early spring by cropping it down.?

New York and Virginia.?Gov.
Scrward of New York lately demanded ol
Gov. Gilrocr of Virginia, a fugitive from
u 7 n
justice, who after leaving the former
1 state, took shelter in the latter. Gov.
Gilmer refund to deliver the fugitive unless
Gov. Seward should first comply
with the previous demand made on him
for fugitives from Virginia. The Ilousc
o c*
of Delegates of Virginia called upon the
Governor for the facts in the case. These
were sent by mc&sagc, when the House,
after a delay of one day, and some dehate,
passed the following preamble and
resolution.
"Whereas it appears that the Govern,
or of New York hath demanded of the
Governor of Virginia n fugitive from jus
tice, legally charged with crime in thai
State, an J now con ti nod in this, and thai
I such demand hath been made in conformity
with the Constitution and laws of th(
United States, hut that the Governor o
this Slate, considering that the Governoi
... J - - - o
of New York has ver.v recently refuse <.
to comply with a similar demand upor
him made by this Slate, has deemed ii
projHjr to decline for the present tosurren
der the said fugitive ; and while the en
eral Assembly hath full confidence thai
the course adopted by our Governor hntf
proceeded from an anxious and patriotic
desire to induce the State of New Yort
to comply with her constitutional obligu.
tions to this State; yet, as the Genera
Assembly haih solemnly protested agninsi
the conduct of that State on the occasior
alluded to, as a palpable violation of sniii
obligation, and has maintained, and slil!
maintains, that the duty of the Executive
of each State to surrender fugitives legaily
charged with crime, when propcrl)
demanded by any other State, is one im<
periously enjoined by the Constitution
and laws :
"Resolved therefore, by the General Assembly,
That in its opinion the said fugi
tive, it legally charged with crime, com.
mitted in New York, and demanded b)
* ~ * j; A _
tne governor ot mai oiarc according u
the Constitution and laws of the Unitec
Stales, ought to be surrendered, notwith
[ standing the refusal of the Governor ol
j New York so to act in a similar case."
On the passage of this preamble and
resolution only 7 members voted in the
negative. Gov. Gilmer thereupon resigned
his office. It was just at the close
of the session and after many of the members
had gone homo ; not expecting any
important business to cornc up. Owing
to this circumstance, the legislature determined
to make no election of Governor.
According to the Constitution of the
Slate, the senior Councillor is to be Gov.
ernor in such case. Joiix M. Pattox
was the senior Councillor till the 1st.
March, at which time his term expires,
and John Ruthkbkord becomes senioi
Councillor. Ot course, the former is Governor
from the day of the resignation
(March 20lh) to this day, that is 11 days.
From this time the latter becomes Governor.
The Richmond Whig, on the occasion
uses the following language :
Wc arc not surprised that Gov. Gilracr't
course in this matter meets with the ap
probation of our venerable neighbor, wh<i
, is at his wit'send to get capital for his party
operations. We do not think howevei
that we exaggerate in saying that it is regretted
by nearly the whole community
besides, comprehending both parties. In
a very extensive communication we have
j not met with the first man that did nol
| express his regret at the course of the
! Governor of Virginia, and that too withI
out any reference to party.
> Has not the case occured when the
Governor of New York, under the Consti
' tution of the United States, had a righ
i to demand the surrender of a fugitive
from the justice of that State ? No mar
can or well deny it. Is the Constitutor
less operative upon Virginia, than New
York in the case of the three fugitive*
, who stole the negro, refused to delivei
| them up? It would be a strange anc
] dangerous code of ethics which justifiec
j A in committing a crime, because B hac
! also committed it.?Do two wrongs mak<
' a right! If New York violates the Con
j # O
stitation, does that authorise or excus<
Virginia in doing it?Virginia who is u!
ways professing her undying allegiance t<
i that sacred instrument ? Rather, w<
! | would 3ay, let Virginia embrace that op
. portunity to show her integrity. * * * '
j New York violates the Constitution ir
, respect to the rights of Virginia ; twclvi
1 months nfterward, Virginia is appealed t<
j by New York to deliver a fugitive. Tin
,! occasion was opportune and glorious, t<
' | prove her magnanimity, her fidelity to th<
| Constitution, her elevation above petty
motives of pique and resentment, such o:
'' sway little souls, but ought not to swaj
a great and renowned Commonwealth
i What is the answer of Virginia to New
j York ? Why this in effect: You hav<
> violated the Constitution and denied ou<
, i right?and we will violate the Constitu
t' tjon and deny your right 1 We canno
' imagineany thing conducted in worsi
policy or worse taste. We would hav<
. gloried to see old Virginia embracing thh
.1 opportunity to assert her ancient charac
i ler; saying to New York, you hav<
| wronged me, but that shall not induce mi
i to do wrong?You have violated thi
| constitution in refusing to deliver up ti
J ine fugitives from justice?I disdain U
' 1 follow an example founded in outrage ti
> i the Constitution of the country, and jus
tice to a sister State. I seek redress bj
nobler means than the retaliation ofpeth
injuries. You may disregard the Consti
t;i!ion, hut I will adhere to it."
'j Thus will Virginia reason. The Pco
1 pie will, not, cannot approve, of this stc|
! of Governor Gilmer, taken, we have n<
doubt, in haste, and less like Virginia thai
any thing that Virginia ever did. Opin
ion is probably not fully shaped yet but a
! far as it is formed, there appears to be i
I very general feeling of regret.

PniLADF.LPiiiA, March23d, 1841.
21 In the Court of Common Pleas to-day,
2 j all three of the Judges delivered them3,
selves of opinions in the case of citation
3! against the U. S. Rank. Proceedings
3 ! you remember were instituted against
* I the Bank under the Resumption Act of
f i the last session of the Legislature, the
V! provisions of which work a forfeiture of
; charter in ten dnys after refusal to pay
j specie for its liabilities. The exceptions
* j taken to proceedings instituted under
P ; this Act, were that .it was er post facto,
^ S conflicted with the charter of the Bank,
3 ' which was averred t6 be a contract, and
* was repugnant to the Constitution of the
N State as well as to that of the United
ft I States. Well, these exceptions have all
been sustained in the most unqualified
. manner, and the Bank is now thrown
; back upon the law creating it, which you
- may remember permits it suspend ninety
' days without any other penalty than that
'* fof paying twelve per cent interest on tne
- amount of all demands for specie. Judge
King distinctly stated that the Bank of
:? the United States and two other of our
Banks were not amenable to the Act of
the lost session, and that all the others
were. He however wished that the case
0 might be carried up to the highest Court,
a matter in which he will probably not he
q disappointed, as I noticed a similar case
was immediately moved. The Court was
0 greatly crowded, and the decision is looked
upon by the friends of the Bank, and
all its abuses as a great triumph. The
delivery of the opinions occupied about
i 1-2 hours.
^ The effort made on Saturday to make
some arrangements with our city banks
6 in reference to the notes of the U. S. Bank
again failed, and the discount upon them
0 arc to pay up to 16 to 17 per cent.
In stocks a very moderate amount of
0 { business was done at some little improve- ]
ment on Saturday'* prices.
Piiidadrm'iiia, J/arch 23, 1841.
I was informed to-day that thearrangcmcnt
sought to he made by the United
States Bank with our city banks, relative
to taking its notes at par, is all off again,
I) in consequence of the disposition manifested
by the legislature not to do any thing
in the way of " Relief." Every movement
and ever}' day's experience goes to
confirm the opinion which I have frequent.
ly expressed to you, thnt nothing will be
q done at Ilarrisburg, Under these mani
festations the banks are but littlo inclined
to increase their responsibilities. They
are husbanding their resources and making
every preparation in their power to i
save themselves, and each for itself.
The bills of the Bank are nt a depreciation
1 of 15 to 16 per cent to day for paper and !
for specie.

to inform you the scape goats continue to
seek shelter in General Armstead's "city

to return on a parole of honor, to his hammock

Secondly?Col. Worth has at length
succeeded (n opening a communication
with our most indomitable foe Coacooche
who has expressed a wish to holde a talk
with two of the Arkansas Delegation
whom he named, in relation to the promf
ised land beyond, not Jordan but the Mississippi.
this was a step quite as impor.
i, tant to the termination of tnc Florida War
and apparently obtained with as much
difficulty, as the interview of the English
authorities with his Celestial Highness."
during the Opium War; but I reckon in
this case Coacoochee will get the money.
Thirdly?Hos-pi-takee, a Southern
Chief, has sent in two Wariors to Col.
Davenport at Sara-sota. I looked upon
this as a pretty important straw, showing
which way the wind is blowing in that
quarter.
Fourthly?Ilallock Tusteniiggee, with
about 100 Wariors, having been twice
w
whipped by Lieut. Albertis, of which I
grave you the particulars,was trailed to his
camp on the Ochlawuha, eight miles South
of Fort Mackay by Captain Burnham,
and again whipped and routed with considerable
loss. Then came the sacking
of the camp, such a scramble you never
saw. There were Bear-skins, coon-skins
ind dear-skins, pots, kettles, hoes, axes,
and mockasins and beads, fresh dressed
version and wild turkics, coonta, corn and
bears oil, ladles sophkasifters, kneeding*
trays, &c. &c. I got for my share a string
of beads, three sophkasifters and a wooden
spoon big enough to feed Mr. Blair! A

Kerr with his Company of Dragoons, ha?
taken the opposite side of the river, hoping
to have the game Jliuthed and driven into
his hands.
General Tustenuggee will stand in need
of all his skill to enable him to elude such
a pursuit. I should not be surprised if,
he having been beaten three times fn as

From the West we learn that 60 more
Indians have positively c< me in at Fori
Fanning, and been sent down to Tampa ;
and also that Gen. Arrnistead had actually
made a shipment to the West. This it
very encouraging, um we musi wait ?
while, before we can exult much in our
prospect.
There is an uncommon proportion of
women and children among those who
have surrendered, and the whole number
is but a fairing, to what there are iu the
woods. With all our boasting we have
not yet found out all their haunts, nor do
we yet know what will be the effect ol
money and negotiations upon the larger
parties.
On the subject of a war between England
and America, the London Journal
of Commerce holds the following lan<
age:
* We have no fear of a war between
the United States and this country. The
Americans know their own interest, and
appreciate their own situation thoroughly;
they know that all wars are detrimental
to the production of wealth ; and they
further know, that a war between England
and the United States, though it might be
temporarily disastrous to English trade
and manufactures, would utterly destroy
the system of credit on which ultimately
depends all their undertakings and obliga?
(tons. The magni'ude of national and
individual interests is the best bond ol
peace. The greater the commercial rela.
tions between the two nations, the greater
is the security for the maintenance o(
peace. Can either country have a better
reason for abandoning a system which re,
stricts their commercial operations?"
