MISCELLANY.

■ ' From the Southern Recorder.
SOUTH FLORIDA.
Messrs. Editors:—In the midst of the despon
dency that now reats on the industry and enter
prise of this country, springing front the total
prostration of the value of our great southern sta
ple, and which almost forbids a ray of hope for
the future, I feel that perhaps I might do the com
munity some good, by furnishing it with some
notes of intelligence lately derived from a trip to
the upper St. Johns. Perhaps there is no spot
on the globe, so near to a civilized people, about
which there is so little known ; and so true is
this, that the very maps of South Florida, except
for the outlines, are of no value.—There is great
prejudice too against this country; and yet I
much question whether there is a spot to be found
which holds forth the same inducements to the
settler, where there is greater promise of long
life—and where enterprise and industry, can in
so little time, under the blessings of Providence,
convert poverty and embarrassment into compe
tency and ease. The territory of which I speak,
stretches from the 30th down to the 24th degree
of north latitude, is the most southern part of the
United States, and is the only part of it now that
can grow the tropical productions to any perfec
tion.
The great mass of the country is poor pine
land, clothed with good timber, and interspersed
with streams of running water. In various parts
of the country, however, you find spots of
rich fine land: also hammocs and praries of un
rivaled beauty; and on a few of these, situate in
•bout. 28 degrees of north latitude, I promise
to make a few remarks.
He who wishes a settlement of rich* very rich
pine lands, will find it in the Fort Gatlin settle
ment, about 25 miles south west of Lake Mon
roe. This body of land is about 10 by 30 miles,
is clothed with straight tall timber, free to split,
ahd beautiful to make hou^s. It is well water
. -or V" . ‘ : ' '* ,
ed with running streams, and small living fresh
water lakes teeming with fish, and surrounded
with deer and turkies. There is no undergrowth
except a rich broad ' bladed grass, growing
about two feet high, and furnishing inexhausti
ble supplies for stock both summer and winter.—
The land lies undulating, and is extremely rich,
composed of black loam, fine sand, and sea shells,
as is the case with all the rich lands of - this re
gion. • 1
East of this, and in the same latitude lies Lake
Jessup, 12 miles long and 4 broad, connecting by
its eastern end with the river St. Johns and sur
rounded by about 20,000 acres of the piettiestand
richest lands that I have ever seen in any coun
try. About half of this land is prarie, clothed
with grass, and a luxuriant wood called the wild
sun-flower, and which in bloom presents to the
beholder an uninterrupted sheet of yellow, far as
the eye can reach. The hammock is one of the
same level, and is the same kind of soil, and is
clothed with oak of various kinds, the cabbage
tree, gum, hickory, poplar, red cedar, magno
lia, and orange trees, besides many others for
which I have no name. The soil is a dark
gray, composed of loam, sand, and sea-shells ; it
is said to be about two feet deep and Tests on blue
clay. This prarie and hammock is from 2 to
5 miles wide, and is more than 20 miles long,
stretching all around the lake, and is accessible
in its whole range by steamboats. It is als*
bounded in its whole length by pine land, conve
nient for building, and here no doubt from 100 to
150 families might be located with great advan
tage, and 1500 hands could be employed more
lucratively, than any where else of which I have
any knowledge.
In the midst of Lake Jessup, is Bird Island, of
about 100 acres, nearly circular; it is all a rich
prarie, except two acres in its centre, which is
its highest-part, and clothed with timber. In the
spring it is the rendezvous of myriads of water
fowls that collect here to hatch and rear their
young; and while this work is going on, their
screams are heard at all hours of the night, and
never die on the ear. It would be a good spot
for a hermit’s cell or a fairy’s palace, and with
the same improvement, would rival in beauty the
far farmed Isola Bella, of lake Maggiore in
Italy. .
six miles northwest ot Lake Jessup, lies
Lake Monroe, a beautiful sheet of water, of about
five miles in diameter. On its north-eastern
shore is the village of Enterprise, a place at
which Major Taylor has made considerable im
provement. On the southern side is Fort Mel
lon, beautifully situated, and where probably in
a few years, there will be a handsome town, fur
nishing supplies for the Fort Gatlin and Lake
Jesup settlements.—This, too, will be in the line
of the great Southern mail to Tampa, and proba
bly in a few years a railroad will stretch from
this point to Tampa, whirling forward those mil
lions of commerce, that now are so frequently
wrecked on the Florida Keys.
Back from Fort Mellon one mile, along a
straight fine road, cast up by the army when sta
tioned here, lies Fort Read, surrounded by the
pine forest, and sufficiently elevated to have a
handsome view of the lake through the trees.
This will be a delightful ridge for private resi
dences, as well as a most valuable retreat for in
valids ; the more so, perhaps, of any in all Flori
da ; and the consumptive patient who finds no re
lief here, need hardly look for help in this world.
Lake Monroe is desirable as a place of residence,
not only because of its water scenery, but also
because of the absence of rich alluvial lands on
its margin—-the pine land coming down in most
instances to the water, and forming a smooth san
dy beach. It was Christmas when we were
there. The days were clear and bright, and the
nights balmy and pleasant; so that often standing
upon the wharf looking at the moon beams play
ing on the lake, and listening to the rustling of
the waves as they dashed on the beach, with si
lence all around, unbroken but by the humming
of our own voices, or the scream of the crane, as
he winged his way to perhaps a distant home,
sometimes induced feelings more akin to visions
of fancy, than the sober realities of this world.
The waters’of South Florida are filled with
fish in greater profusion than I have known any
where else; so that it requires little trouble to
supply the table at all times. So also game of
all description. Ducks, turkeys and deer, are in
profusion. I saw at one time on Lake George,
what was supposed to be half a million of ducks
covering the lake for miles; and when portions
of them would rise to fly, they made a sound like
a coming hurricane. No country produces more
food for cattle, and none can show cattle that arc
finer, and this too, without being fed by their own
ers summer or winter.
South Florida has one advantage of the great
est importance. There are no inundations or
floods in her rivers or creeks, and perhaps two
feet is the utmost variation from high water in
the St. Johns, so that there is no danger of crops
drowning from flood here.
The sugar cane ripens from 20 to 25 joints,
and frequently tassels out like Indian Corn; it is
cut in November and December, and manufac
tured into sugar, and the united testimony of the
settlers, is that it will make 2000, lb. per acre. It
is as easy cultivated as Indian Corn, and is the
least subject to casaulties of any crop that grows.
—I saw of this .sugar some worth 8 cents in
the Savannah market. This is 160 dollars to
the acre!!! (How much is an acre of cotton
worth 1 perhaps five dollars.) Knock off half
of this estimate and still there is enough and
more than enough left.
i ne opamsn xooacco is another production
of this climate, and grows here to perfection ; it
is a peculiar kind of tobacco, and is greatly ad
mired for fine segars. Spain, I learn, has hith
erto monopolised all of this article made in her
colonies, so that it is little known in this country,
even with segar smokers. It sells at about 40
cents per lb. in the leaf; it is said by those who
profess to know most about it, that it will be more
profitable than the sugar cane itself. If so, it
must be a good business. They are entering
heartily into its cultivation in Florida.
The Sea Island cotton is also grown here to
great pertection, but I found the Alachua plant
ers disposed to abandon it. They had not made
more than 280or 300 dollars to the handthisyear,
and were dissatisfied. They said they would
go at Tobacco and Sugar hereafter..
Oranges also grow in their native soil in South
Florida. These woods are filled with the na
tive orange groves, and nothing can be more
beautiful, than to see even in the depth of Win
ter, the deep green tress, all interspered and
bending with the yellow fruit—I camped in
the wild orange groves, and again and again
slept under their shelter, where the fruit were all
hanging over me. It is easy to inoculate these
trees with the sweet orange, and then in a few
years, you can have groves that will bring you
4, 5 ana 6 dollars to the tree each year. There
is no better business than this to men of small
capital, for the labor is very small, and you may
multiply your trees to any extent.
I have no doubt that the coffee tree and many
cither of the West India fruits that I have not
mentioned will be found cultivated in South Flor
ida in a few years. There are immense bodies
of good lands on the lakes and rivers still further
south than where I was, where all these fruits
may grow, and unquestionably will do so here-1
after.
It is true, that this country is wild and unset
tled, but it cannot remain so long, the lands are
public and therefore to the settler now cost noth
ing ; and it is not probable that they will be in the
market for 12 or 15 years to come.
I do not desire, what I have here said, to mis
lead any one. I have spoken of what I saw, and
what I heard with such authority as to have no
doubt in my own mind as to its truth, still no
one should move to a new country on the opin
ion of another. Men have different tastes and
see things through different mediums, and each
one should therefore go and judge for himself.
Do this, and at least no harm can do done by this
article.
Alexander Speer.
Culloden, Jan. 14, 1845.
LOUIS PHILIPPE.
The New Orleans Picayune makes the fol
lowing sensible remarks on the romantic fortunes
of the King of the French.
There is no man, perhaps, now living, whose
life has been so chequered as that of Louis Phil
ippe, the present monarch of France. Reared
in the lap of royalty, brought up amidst the lux
uries of a princely court, he was, at an early age,
in order to preserve his life, compelled to fly from
both court and country, and under an exiled
name to travel over most of the countries of Eu
rope, often dependant on a peasant’s hospitality
for a portion of his rough fare, which the exiled
prince found necessary to sustain nature. Nor
was this all. He learned that the people over
whom his relatives had ruled, had guillotined
their king, and that the other members of his
family, like himself, were wanderers in the world.
To those who offered him succor in this his hour
of need, it appears that he is not forgetful, as the
following will show. It is copied into a London
paper from a Swedish journal. “ On the 3d inst.,
(July,) Vice Consul Burk, (rather a Mitesian
name for a Swede,) celebrated the eighty-second
anniversary of his birth-day. On the same day
he received a letter from the King of the French,
written with his own hand, and accompanied by a
gold medal. The letter which was dated from
Neuilly, reads in these words..
"II is alwaysagreeaDie to me to find tfiat the trav
eller Mulcr [the name under which the king trav
elled in Sweden to elude his pursuers,] has not
been loTgotten in a country which he visited in a
simple guise, and unknown; and I always recall
with pleasure this journey to my mind. Among
my recellections, I give the first place to the hos
pitality so frankly an4 cordially granted me a
stranger, throughout Norway, and particularly
in Norland and Finmark; when at this moment
the lapse of forty-nine years since, I made this
journey into Norway, has left me but few of my
old hosts remaining, it ts gratifying to me to be
able to express to all, in your person, what grate
full feelings I still entertain.”
The travels of the exiled prince in this country
are little less eventful than in Europe, save that he
was not haunted with the fear of being captured
and handed over to the merciless disposition of
those who thirsted for bis blood. Here, as
there, he taught school for his support, and
here, as there, the hand of hospitality was stretch
ed out to him, aye, in this very city. Indeed,
wo learn that he still retains a lively recollec
tion of the liberal courtesies extended to him,
when he sojourned here, by our worthy fellow
citizen, Bernard Marigny.
In Boston, too, Louis Phillippe received some
attention, and in Portsmouth, N. H. ho was most
agreeably entertained. He took a letter of in
troduction from Gov. Hancock to Jacob Sheafe,
Esq., a wealthy and hospitable merchant of that
place, and was, cordially received and kindly
treated by him. He was also entertained by Gov.
London and other gentlemen of that town,
which was then distinguished for its generous
hospitalities.
The Picayune concludes its remarks with
these sentiments:
“But how strange it is-after suffering all the
privations he did, both in Europe and here—af
ter having providentially escaped from a French
privateer as he returned to Europe—afterfinding
so many barriers between- the throne of France
and himself—first the Republic—next theempire
—and next the elder branch of the Bourbons oc
cupying it—that fate or fortune should so soon
have battered them all down and permitted him
peaceably to ascend it and sit on it for a period of
fifteen years in undisturbed peace and quiet. His
indeed has been a romance of real life.”
BONES IN THE DESERT.
Theaccustomed route (M. Dumas says) is mark-!
ed by a white line of bleached bones extending to
the norizion. This extraordinary circumstance,
it may well be supposed, aroused all my atten
tion. 1 called to Beehara, who, however, did
not wait for my question, for he at once read my
desire in my obvious astonishment. “The
dromedary," said he, coming to my side, and
commencing his story, without preface, “ is not
so troublesome and importunate on animal as
the horse. He continues his course without
stopping, without eating, without drinking; no
thing about him betrays sickness, hunger, or
exhaustion. The Arab, who can hear from such
a distance the roar of a lion, the neigh of a
horse, or the noise of men, hears nothing from
his haghin bul its quickened or lengthened re
spiration ; it never utters a complaint or a groan.
But when nature is vanquished by suffering;
when privations have exhausted its strength ;
when life is ebbing, the dromedary kneels down,
stretches out its neck, and closes its eyes. Its
master then knows that all is over. He dis
mounts, and without an attempt to make it rise,
for he knows the honesty of its nature, and never
suspects it of deception or laziness,—he removes
the saddle, places it on the back of another
dromedary, and departs, abandoning the one that
is no longer able to accompany him. When
night approaches, the jackals and hyenas, at
tracted by the scene, come up and attack the poor
animal till nothing is left but the skeleton. We
are now on the highway from Cairo to Mecca:
twice a year the caravans go and return by this
route; and these bones, so numerous, are so
constantly replenished that the tempests of the
desert can never entirely disperse them; these
bones which, without a guide would lead you
to the oases, the wells and fountains, where
the Arabs find shade and water and would
end by conducting you to the tomb of the
prophet; 'these bones are those of dromeda
ries which perished in the desert. If you look
attentively, you will see some bones smaller in
size, and of a different conformation. These
too, are the wrecks of wearied bodies, that have
found repose before they reached the goal. They
are the bones of believers who desired to obey
the Prophet’s command, that all the faithful shall
once in their lives perform this holy journey ;
and who have been so long deterred from it,
on earth, that they are obliged to finish it in
heaven. Add to these some stupid Turk or
bloated eunuch, who, sleeping when he ought to
have his eyes open, has fallen and broken his
neck; give the plague its share, which often
decimates a caravan; and the simoom, which]
often destroys one, and you will readily see that
these funeral guide-po&ts ave planted with suffi
cient frequency to preserve the road in good
order, and to point out to the children the route
pursued by their fathers.”—Quinze Jours au
Sinai, by M. Dumas.
RUINS OP AN ANCIENT CITV.
Mr. Laurie, whefse mission is to the Mountain
Nestorians, in a letter dated in August, gives a
brief acconnt of the wonders which M. Botta, the
French Consul in Persia, is bringing to light at
Khorsabad. At this place, he is excavating the
earth and bringing before the light of day the ruins
of a mighty city, consisting of towers, pieces of
sculpture, large rooms, or parts of houses, one of
which is a hundred feet in length. One of the
pieces of sculpture represents a royal feast, with
chairs and tables, in the European style; another
represents the siege of a city, &c., &c.
“The French government, (Mr. Laurie says,)
has sent out an accomplished artist to take draw
ings of the whole. Judging from what I have
seen, the literary world will have no cause to
mourn the absence ofthe originals. The designs
of the Assyrian sculptor are reproduced in all
their life, and the copies bid fair to awaken more
interest now than did the originals in the days of
their glory.
“ It is the design ofthe government to issue the
whole in the magnificent style in which its work
on Persepolis is to appear. M. Botta has already
more than a hundred folio pages of inscriptions,
and M. Flandin has a still greater quantity of the
mostexquisitedrawings. As many as ninety men
have sometimes been employed at once in the
excavations ; and the work has been prosecuted
without interruption during the heat of summer,
and still two-thirds of the mound remain un
touched."
SINGULAR TRAITS OP SONG BIRDS.
A gentleman of my acquaintance had an
American mocking bird in such health and
vigor that it was constantly singing or else imi
tating the various sounds it heard. In order to
try the powers of this bird the owner purchased a
fine sky lark. When placed in the same room
with the mocking-bird, the song of the former
was heard to echo through the house, as if it
were chanting “ on fluttering wing,” its well
known welcome to the rising sun. The mock
ing bird was silent for some time, but at last
broke forth in the strains of the “ aerial songster,”
but louder and clearer, as if mounting and
stretching its wings towards heaven. The lark
was silent from that moment, nor was a joyous
note ever heard afterwards. Willing to test the
powers of the mocking-bird still further, an uuu
sually large price was given for a black-bird,
celebrated for vocal powers. It was placed in
| the same room with the mocking-bird. Early
on the second morning its song was resumed,
and its charming notes were warbled forth with
all the sweetness and modulations which may be
heard in its native “thorny brakes." The
mocking-bird listened and was silent for a time;
when all at once its notes were heard to issue
forth, but louder and sweeter than those of the
woodland song. The poor black-bird heard
them, felt that it was conquered, remained silent,
drooped, pined, and died. From the above facts,
emulation would seem to be one of the exciting
causes of the songs of birds. When their pow
ers are excelled they appear to feel the disgrace
of being conquered, and to lose an inclination to
renew their former effort.—-Jesse's Country
Life.
A WORD TO THE DEJECTED.
Ah ! that I could be heard by all oppressed,
dejected souls I I would cry to them, “lift up
your heads, and confide still in the future, and
believe that it is never too late ! See 1 I too
was bowed down by long suffering, and old age
had, moreover, overtaken me, and I believed
that all my strength had vanished—that my
life and my sufferings were in vain—and, be
hold! my head has been again lifted up, my I
heart appeased, my soul strengthened,—and,
now, in my fiftieth year, I advance into a new
future, attended by all that life has beautiful and
worthy of love."
The change in my soul has enabled me better
to comprehend life and suffering, and I am now
firmly convinced that “ there is no fruitless suff
ering, and that no virtuous endeavour is in vain.”
Winter days and nights may bury beneath
their pall of snow the sown corn, but when the
spring arrives, it will be found equally true, that
“ there grows much bread in the winter night.”

LIFE INSURANCE.
It seems to us so clearly the interest of every
man with a family dependent upon his life and
labor, to spare a portion of his annual earnings
or salary, for an insurance on his own life, that
we commend the project to the consideration of
all readers to such a position.
What more grateful tribute, for instance, could
a congregation pay to a devoted clergyman, than
to insure his life for the benefit of his family %
The sum which each pewholder, for example,
might be called on to contribute for such a pur
pose, would hardly be felt, while the aggregate
would serve to relieve their pastor from the na
tural solicitude for those whom his death at any
moment might leave destitute, and to endear to
him more and more those who should thus testify
heir regard for his family.

While in my glass the sand-grains shiver;

CHRISTIAN BENEVOLENCE.
We have been deeply engaged, recently, in
the consideration of this subject, and, in looking
about us, we are disposed to think that it is prac
tised by few, very few, in the extended sense
which is enjoined by the Holy Scriptures. We
find many, it is true, willing to contribute to the
aid of benevolent enterprises, who cheerfully as
sist the missionary cause, and lend a liberal sup
port to the ministry and to various public chari
ties ; but may not the dross of human infirmity
mingle with these offerings? We honor the
heart that is willing to lend a cheerful support
to these enterprises, but we would not have be
nevolence confined tothese public manifestations
It is in the every-day transactions of life that we
would see it shine with its purest lustre, particu
larly in the conduct of those of our own sex.
To relieve the distresses of the poor and afflicted
is only an exercise of common humanity, which
every woman feels prompted to by the very con
stitution of her nature ; it is natural for her to re
volt at the view of suffering, and tender her aid
for its alleviation. Nor does Religion originate
this feeling, it only strengthens and purifies it.
One of the most charitable ladies (in the com
mon acceptation of the term) I ever knew, was
decidedly irreligious ; why she was so unosten
tatiously charitable, was a problem I did not
solve for many years. Many motives may con
spire to induce a female to be active in public
charities, and, yet, she may be destitute of true '
benevojence. She may never have laid down,
as a rule of conduct, the maxim, to prefer the
happiness of others to the gratification of vanity,
or any other petty feeling. True benevolence
exhibits itself in a self-denying kind deportment
towards others. She. who possesses it will seek
to make the most humble domestic in her ser
vice happy. She will carefully avoid all unne
cessary fault-finding; seek out means for their
innocent enjoyment; and endeavour to improve
and* benefit them by her counsel, as well as ex
ample.
Towards her equals she will be courteous, not
seeking for opportunities to impress them with a
sense of her superiority. To increase the sum
of human happiness being her constant aim, of
course the law of kindness will govern all her
words and influence all her actions. Should she
sometimes find her most conscientious efforts to
be useful—censured, and unworthy motives im
puted to her, she will not suffer the detraction
to disturb the equanimity of her feelings. Oh
that the too just reproach of a tendency to de
traction and slander were wiped away from our
sex, and they become what they should be to-!
wards each other; pitying and striving to amend
the failings of their erring associates, instead of
making them subjects of unkind remark, and too
often unjust censure. How has many a pang
been inflicted by ladies in the idle chat of an hour,
which has agonized and destroyed the peace of an
innocent one, when to amuse or entertain was
alone the object of the narrator.
A truly benevolent female is governed by
more exalted views. She believes God’s Holy
word, and knows that, for the abuse of her con
versational powers, she will have to account.
And, besides, she has a delicate sensitiveness
which shrinks from intermeddling in the affairs
of others, which is the source of all the slander
and detraction which so often poisons our social
intercourse, and converts our villages into scenes
of discord and strife.
True benevolence is the fountain of true polite
ness. It will be seen, not only in the drawing
room to superiors or equals, but shown to the ■
most abject creature who may be thrown in the
way. We have sometimes felt shocked at ob
serving those who enjoyed much reputation for
gentility and refinement, suffering honest poverty
to stand in their dwellings uninvited to rest their
weary limbs, while transacting necessary busi
ness.
We all possess the power, in some degree,
straitened as our means may be, to do good, and
add to the aggregate of human happiness. The
overflowings of this kindly household benevo- j
lence, has sent a thrill to many a heart, and a )
mental God blt-ss you, has been ejaculated by
hearts subdued by misfortune, as they felt they
were still recognized as fellow beings. True
benevolence is not short-lived; it is not stimu
lated by the eyes of others upon us, nor does it
court the commendation of the world. But hav
ing its spring in the Christian heart, it continu
ally sends forth its streams of living water, re
freshing and blessing all in its course, and is fed
from the ocean of love on high.
The selfishness of human nature is opposed
to it, and it is only by the influence of grace that
a fallen creature can become'so transformed as
to exercise it all times. But, thank God, we
have seen exhibitions of it in those of our own
sex. We have seen it in those who desired not the
honours of the world or the praise of men, but
were ever seeking to lay up treasure in Heaven.
The world may not have known them, but they j
have been known by God and the Holy Angels,!
and recognized in the world of Spirits, as I he ]
heirs of Salvation, and in the day of final reckon-1
ing will hear the welcome plaudit, “ Well done, j
inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least
of these, ye have done it unto me.” A Lad v.

CHILDREN.
THE SORE TONGUE. '
There was a little girl called Fanny, who had
the misfortune one day to bite her tongue as she
was eating her breakfast. It hurt her so that she
could scarcely help crying; and even when the
first smart was over it continued so sore that when
ever she spoke it pained her very much. Finding
this to be the case, she said very pitifully to her
mother, “ Mamma, you can’t think how it hurts
me when I speak!’’ “ Does it 1" replied her
mother, “then I’ll tell you what I would advise
you to do ;—resolve all this day to say nothing
but what is either necessary or useful; this will
give your tongue a fine holyday and may an
swer more purposes titan one.
Fanny, knowing that she had the character of
being somewhat loquacious, could not help laugh
ing at this ; and said, “Well, I will try for once;
so, mum ; I am going to begin now, mamma.
Mother. Do so; and whenever you are be
ginning to speak, be sure you ask yourself
whether what you were going to say was likely
to be of any use, or whether it was necessary.
Fanny. Yes, yes, I will: but don’t talk to
me, mamma, for fear:—so saying, she screwed
up her lips, and taking her work, sat for about five
minutes as still as a mouse. She then looked up,
smiled, and nodded at her mother, as much as to
say “ see how well I can hold my tongue,” still
screwing her lips very tight for fear she should
speak. Soon however she began to feel a great
inclination to say something; and was glad to
recollect that if sho could but think of any thing
either useful or necessary, she might speak, j
Whereupon she endeavored to find something to
say that would come within the act. To aid her
.invention, she looked all round the room:—
Fanny. _ Mamma, don’t you think the fire
wants stirring ? (This question, she thought,
savoured of both qualifications) - ’
Mother. Not at present, my dear.
Then followed another long silence: for Fan
ny found it vastly more difficult than she had any
previous idea of, to think of any thing useful to
to talk about; and she knew her mamma would
laugh at her if she said what was obviously idle
or silly just now. She was beginning to repent
having made such an agreement, when her three
elder sisters entered the room. * She now thoughtj
it quite reasonable, if not absolutely necessary, to
a* * *
tell them of her misfortune, which she did ait
considerable length, and with many needless
digressions; (the usual custom with great talkers)
upon which they all laughed ; prophesying that
her resolution would not last half an hour ; and
rallying her for telling such a long story with a
sore tongue.
Soon after, some ladies called to pay their
mother a morning visit. This gave Fanny’s
tongue such a long rest, dial the moment they
were gone it seemed irresistibly to resume its
wonted functions.
Fanny. What a while old Mrs. W. has had
that brown satin pelisse! Really poor old lady,
I am quite tired of seeing her in it.
Mother. How is your tongue, Fanny.
Fanny. O, better, mamma, thank you, almost
well.
Mother. I am sorry for it; I was in hopes it
would have been sore enough at least to prevent
your making impertinent remarks upon any body
all this day.
Fanny. No, but really, mamma, is it hot an
old rubbishing thing 1
Mother. I don’t know, indeed': it is no busi
ness of mine ; therefore I took no notice of it.
A silence ensued after this: but conversation
revived when Caroline, who had stood for some
time with her eyes fixed on tbeir opposite neigh
bor’s window, suddenly exclaimed,‘Idobelieve the
Jones’s are going to have company again to day I
the servant has just been lighting the fire in the
drawing-room ; and there is Miss Jones now
gone up to dress; I saw her draw down the blinds
in her room this instant.” “So she is,” said Lucy,
looking up : “ I never knew such people in my
life ! they are always having company."
“ I wonder who they are expecting to day 1 ”
said Eliza, “ dinner company, I suppose.”
The proceedings of their neighbors, the Jones’s,
continued to furnish matter for various sagacious
conjectures and remarks for a considerable time;
at length Caroline exclaimed with the eagerness
of discovery—
“Look! look! there’s the baker now at the
door, with a whole tray full of tarts and things:
make haste, or he’ll be gone in.”
Lucy. So he is, I declare , it it a dinner-paTty
then : well, we shall see presently, I hope, who
are coming.
Caroline. O no, they never dine till five, when
they have company.
Eliza. And it will be dark then ; bow tire
some !
LMcy. u miss joncs is not atessed already !
she is this instant come into the drawing-room.
Caroline. Stand back, stand back ! don’t let her
see us all staring: ah, there she is ;—got on her
pink sarsenet body and sleeves to day:—how
pretty that dress is, to be sure!
Eliza. And how nicely she has done her
hair; look Caroline—braided behind.
hu,cy. There, she is putting down the sash.
That chimney smokes, 1 know, with this wind.
Fanny. And there is that little figure, Martha
Jones, come down now : do look, as broad as
she is long; what a little fright that child is, to
be sure!
Mother. Pray, Fanny, was that remark—use
fid or necessary ?
Fanny. O but mamma, I assure you, my
tongue is quite well now.
Mother. 1 am sorry for it, my dear. Do you
know, I should think it well worth while to bite
my tongue every day, if there were no other
means of keeping it in order.
At this the girls laughed ; but their tnother
resuming her gravity, thus continued:
“My dear gitjs, I should before now have put
a stop to this idle gossiping, if I had not hoped
to convince you of the folly of it. It is no won
der, I confess, that at your age you should learn
to imitate a style of remark which is but tc o pre
valent in society. Nothing indeed is more con
tagious : but let me also tell you, that girls of
your age, and of your advantages, are capable
of seeing the meanness of it: and ought to des
pise it. It is the chief end of education to raise
the minds of women above such trifling as this.
But if a young person who has been taught to
think, whose taste has been cultivated, and who
might therefore possess internal resources, has as
much idle curiosity about the affaiis of her neigh
bors, and is as fond of retailing petty scandal con
cerning them, as an uneducated woman, it proves
that her mind is incurably mean and vulgar, and
that cultivation is lost upon her.
“This sort of gossiping, my dear girls", is the
disgrace of our sex. The pursuits of tvomen ly
ing necessarily within a narrow sphere, they na
turally Sink, unless raised by refinement, or by
strong principle, into that littleness of character
for which, even their own husbands and fathers
(if they are men of sense) are tempted to despise
them. 'I he minds of men, from their engage
ments in business necessarily take a larger range;
and they are, in general, too much occupied with
concerns comparatively important, to enter into
the minute details which amuse women. But
women of education have no such plea to urge.
When your father and I direct you to this or
that pursuit, it is not so much for the sake of your
possessing that particular branch; but that by
knowledge in general, you may become intel
ligent and superior ; and that you may be lur>
nished with resources whfch will save you from
the miserable necessity of seeking amusement
from intercourse with your neighbors, and an
acquaintance w’ith their aflairs.
uei us suppose now, tnat tms rooming you
had been all more industriously inclined; and
had been engaged in any of your employments
with that ardor which some happy young people
manifest in the acquisition of knowledge j would
you, in that case, have felt any desire to know
the date of Mrs. W.’s pelisse: or any curiosity in
the proceedings of our neighbors the Jones’s?
No : you would then have thought it a most im
pertinent interruption, if any one had attempted
to entertain you with such particulars :but when
the mind is indolent and empty, then it can re
ceive amusement|frointhe most contemptible sour
ces. Learn then, to check this mean propensity.
Despise such thoughts whenever you are tempt
ed to indulge them: recollect that this low curi
osity, is the combined result of idleness, igno
rance, emptiness and ill nature; and fly to useful
occupation as the most successful antidotcagainat
the evil. Nor let it be forgotten, that such im
pertinent remarks as these come directly under
the description of those "■idle words” of which
an account must be given in the day of judgment.
Yes, this vulgar trifling is as inconsistent will}
the spirit of Christian benevolence, and with the
grand rule of doing to others as we would that
they should do to us,” as it is with refinement of
taste and dignity of character.” “Who would
have thought," said little Fanny, that my hap
pening to bito my tongue this morning, would
have Ted to all this ?'
“It would be a fortunate bite for you Fanny,”
said her mother, and for your neighbors^ if it
should make you more careful in the use of it.
If we were liable to such a misfortune whenever
we use our tongues improperly, some persons
would be in a constant agony:—now if our Con
sciences weTe but half as sensible as our nerves,
they would answer the purpose much better.
Foolish talking pains a gaud conscience, just as
continual speaking hurts a sore tongue; and if we
did wit regard one part as much as the other, it
would act as a constant check upon the unruly
membec.” • **
