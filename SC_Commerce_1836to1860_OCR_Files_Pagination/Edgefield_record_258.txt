TALLAHASSEE, May 8.
Indian -Vetos.-Once more we are com
pelled to darken our columns with the a
trocities of the unrelenting and wakeful
Seminole. AH has been quiet for some
time past, but it was only the fearful calm
which precedes the storm.
Lieutenant Hulhert was a native of
New York, and a graduate of West Point.
We sincerely mourn the loss of these valua
ble young officers of our army.
The following letter from Capt. Peyton,
ne publish verbatim.
ST. MARs. May 7, 1839.
Sir:-I have this moment returned from
Deadmans Bay, and have to communicate
to you the melancholy intelligence of the
murder of Lt, Iulbert, and private O'Dris
coil of the 9th Infantry, by the Seminoles.
The express rider between Fort Frank
Brooke, and Ft. Andrews, did- not arrive
in season, and Lt. Hulliert. with 10 men,
wenc out from the place on the 3d May to
ascertain the reason. About half way be
tween the two posts, the command was
halted, and Lt. H. with O'Driscoll, of (F).
Company, went on in advance, intending
to pass the night at Fr. Frank Brooke.
They were both shot by a party of In
diansatthel4 mile creek, probably while
watering their horses. O'Driscoll's horse
ran into Ft, Frank Brooke, slightly wound
ed, and gave the first news there.
Four balls were shot through Lt. H. but
neither he nor the soldier was scalped.
Both bodies were interred on the 4th ult,
at Deadmans Bay. The express rider has
not-yet been found, and but little doubt is
entertained of his death.
Very respectfully Your oh't serv't.

rived yesterday, we have received the St
Augustine News of the 11th inst. from
which we.copy the following:
Army Intelligence.-From Fort King,
of the 4th inst., we learn that no Indians
had yet come in. A new tiak has been
carried out by J5 prisoners, nen,"women,
and children," covered with presents to
the arch heretics, that they may come in
and sign a treaty to -five in peace south
of Peas Creek, and west of the Ever.
gladas." They are informed that posts
will be extended from Tampa to Fort
Mellon, and the whites are to keep North
and the red men South. The prisoners
are at* liberty to return if they please.
Gen. Taylor had demanded a court of en
quiry in relation to the Missouri volun
teers, and tendered his resignation of the
command in Florida. He says that he is
willing to command a "district." Gen.
Taylor has started for Tampa, where he
has certain information of some whites
tampering with the Indians. The in
struction of Gen. Macomb is, "that the
Indians are to abide by the Treaty made
at Payne's Landing."
From Fort Pierce, 1st May, letters in
form us that twenty-two of Capt. Bryant's
company, 2d dragoons, have joined Col.
Harney, armed wilh "Colts Rifle;" in
the hands of such men, and with such an
officer, we may expect a good acccount,
should one occur, of the enemy.
The names of the persons nurderedt by
the Ind'as at Newnansville, are Perrine,
Stout d Ellis. Young Haigan was
killed by his horse throwing him against
a tree, when the Indians horribly mutila
ted his body with knives. Thus have
four more of our citizens been murdered
- whbilst the white flag is waving throughout
the country.

On Wednesday night last, we are in
formed, a party of Indians attacked aJ
dwelling in the neighborhood of Mr. Wma.
Bellamy, about seven miles from Monti

the noise of the Indians, it being late at
night, and made their escape in the rear
of the house. A part of the buildings
were set fire to and destroyed,-but a de

rived in time to dirive off the Indians and
extinguish the fire. The trail was pur
sued-next day, but no indians captured,

the product of the present season, raised
by Mrs. R. A. Latimer, of this city. The
gross weight of the cocoons was about 15
pounds, some of which were the product
of the White, others of the Black worm;
the former wveighs about 22, the latter a
bout 40 grains-of uncommon size, anmd
varying bmoth in color and beauty. We
are gratified to see thme experiments in this
new and interesting branch of industry,
thtus actively engaging the attention of the
piulic-espec-ially the ladies-and to learn
that while they neither "toil nor spin,"
some portion of that delicate attention re
qisive to foster and mature the experi

both "toil andI spin." We have seen it
stated, and will here repeat it, for the en
couraginug of others-that three ladies on
Long Island, the pust year, realised from
the product of worms, fed by their own

TimE POST OFFIcE DEPARTMENT.-It
i undeniable, many abuses exist in the
>ost office establishment, and great inter
uptions occasionally occur in the trans
nission of the mails. Post Masters. are
1o better than other men, and doubtless
vill have their full portion of sins to an
wer for. But really are they so much
vorse than other men, (if they are the
lepuiies of Amos Kendall,) as to be deser
ing subjects fhr all the abuse that is
leaped upon them by every whig whip
>er snapper of an editor, who lacks any
hng better to write about?
The main cause of the just complaints
igainst the department, we opine, is the
>arsimoniousness of the government, in
tot allowing sufficient compensation to
>ost wasters. The public need not ex
iect something for nothing. if they wish
mportant services to be properly perform
td, they must offer such salaries as will
nduce competent men' to accept of the
fice. Vhile in the large cities the post
nasters are handsomely paid, in the small
pillages, and at the cross roads A here t he
nails are opened, it is otherwise. Ve
ire bold to say, that out of the 11.500 post
nasters in the corps, two-thirds of them
Jo not receive adequate compensation.
And one half receive, literally, no
rompensation at all! Yet they are re
luired to opeu and sort and make up the
nail so many times a week-to take care
if all the letters and papers brought to
heir "office'-to attend there to hand
hem out when called fur-to keep) an ac
:ount of the postages received-lo keep a
ist of all the newspapers taken at their of
ice-and of their subscribers-and to
:ollect the postage on theta-and !o make
i return once a quarter, of all their doings
o head quarters-all for the pitiful sum of
tome 85 or $10 a year!!! To say noiI
ng of the abuse they incur. for ignorance.
ieglect, mai-practice, &c.
Looking at the thing seriously, our only
wonider is, not that it sometimes fails, but
hat the system works at all! By'what
>ther body of men on the face of the globe
s such an amount of labor performed, for
;o little compensation, if compensation it
:anl be called? A mail sometimes miscar
ies, it is true: but is it to be wondered at,
when we consider how iany hands it
)asses through-of men too, who have no
iimulus, by competent salaries, to an ac
ive performance of their duty-who ac
,aept the appointment out ofacconmoda
ion to their neighbors, or because nobody
lse would-and who are ofien totally ig.
tornnt of geography and scarcely able to
Tad? By the ignorance or carelessness
)f any one of these, the whole system is
hrown into disrder--and every post
ntaster exposed to censure.
One fourth of the post offices in the U.
States otght to be abolished! Instead of
>eing a convenience, a clse proximity of
post offices is a nuisance to the public.
Inasmuch as it diminishes the profits at
each, and divides the compensation that
's scarcely adequate to one, among sever
1l post masters; thereby rendering it more
lifficilt to get competont men to accept
the appointment; and hence, being filled
iy non-competent post masters, the d
ies are but slovenly performed or wholly
ieglected-the mails miscarried, the de
iartment abued, and the Post Master
G(eneral wished at the Devil! '
For our part, we believe nothing is
ained b) getting work done for nothing
-in the end it is streto "cost as much as
t comes to." We should have fewer
sost offices, and our post masters should
>e better paid. Every post master should
leceive at least one hundred dollars a
rear for his services. If this platn was
adopted, we should hear less complaint of
-rascally post masters," "irregularities of
be mail," &c. &c.
From the Charleston MercurU.
Ma. Pas-o.-We will trespass so far
mn the courtesy of a party press, as to do
ty an assertion which hears tupotn the ah
ent. It is not true that Mr. Prestotn was
>resent at any caucus of thirteen men in
Tharleston. It is, moreover, trrue, that,
nstead ofeneouragitig, he dissuaded those
vho wished to have a demonstration in
avor of Mr. Clay, from doing so. It was
usserted that the Convention itself was
mnt a Clay conspiracy; adecided majority
vere known to be Clay men; and it was
o prevent the paddic injury which would
esult from any sanction being given to
his stuspicion or imputation,that Mr. Pres
on took ground against a party proceed
tng, whtich might endanger a great gener
I good. It was enough for Mr. Preston,
hat, evil and selfish purposes might he
magined; he promptly submitted himself
o the dictates of pat riot istn, and not only
heerfully forboqre the use of a golden op
>ortunity of persotnal and party vindica
ion, but exercised his great and deserved
nflutence wvith his political associates, to
>revent any party action being had,during
lie sitting of the Convention, or immedi
itely after its adjourneut. Thus much

"But in order to be able to meet a gen
ral combination of the barnks against us,
a a critical emergency, coutld we not
nake a beginning towards an independent
se of our own money, towards'holding
ur own bank in all the dleposites where
is received, and lettitng the Trreasurer
ive his draft or. note for payment at any
articular place, which itt a well conduct
d Governiment, ought to have as niuch
redit as any private draft or bank tnote, or
ill, and would give us the sante facilities
which we derive from the baniks."-Globe.
Proscription.--The Boston Post sums
p the proscription accotunt by a few lines
mmn the Hampshire Repu blicat, thuts:
Our friend Mutnn, of' the llamapshire
tepublicatn, always speaks to the point
then he talus-par example :
"WVhen the Federalists yellp "proscr'ip

The Presbyterian C.urch case.-T ho
Supreme Court have granted a new trial
in this great case. The opinion was deliv
ered by Chief .lustice Gibson. Judge
Rodgers dissented. The opinion of the
Court was favorable to the old General
Assembly.
Mr. Galt.-Galt, the celebrated novelist,
died at Greenock, Scotland, on'the 18th
ult. Some of his works, especially his
earlier productions, are among the most
interesting and instructive, of their class,
in the English language.
Death of Mr. Bicknell.-The Philadel
phia U. S. Gazette announces the death
of Robert T. Bicknell, Esq. long known
as a broker, and a talented conductor of a
commercial periodical in that city.
Death of Gen. WArthur.-The Chilli
cothe Gazette announces the death of Gen.
Duncan M'Arthur, in the 68th year-of his
age, on the 28th ult. He was one of the
earliest settlers of Ohio,. and former Gov
ernor of that State.
Albany Charter election.-The Charter -
election in the city of Albany, has resul
ted in favor of the Whigs, by a majority
of 321 votes.
Who are the .ffice holders.-Foi years,
the Whigs have complained most bitterly
of the proscription and removal from office,
of ihe members of their'party by the Ad
ministration.
They have made many ofihe people be
lieve, that to he a Whig is sufficient for the.
Government to set the seal of condprna
tion upon any man at once. According to
their own accouut,never were poorpatieit
people so persecuted! Like the Waldenses
& Albigenses, celebratedin ecclesiastical
history, they have gone through fiery trials!
Thcy have sacrificed every thing for opin
ion's iake! They are the proscribed,
trampled down, political Refortners of the
country ! Afler all their doleful exclama
tions about persecution, would it'bo believ
ed that even one of the party was in office
under the Gen. Government.- If one read
their papers he ivould suppose that all the
offices in the gift of the goverument were
filled by its own partizans. .Whais the
fact? Many of the highest offlees..are
filled by the Whigs. In a late speech de
livered in Congress, by Dr. Duncan, be
gave the following list of office holders.
We presume that this is nearly accurate.

The WVar, Navy, and Patent Office De
partments are not emhraced in this esti
mate. I feel gesured that in. those depart
ments there will be found to he a large ma
jority of Federalists with proportionate
salaries. I have no doubt but a larae pro
portion of the United States judiciary, of
-ficers of the army and navy, and other
United States officers, are opposed to the
Administration."
In reply to a letter addressed by Dr.
Duncan to Mr. Kendall, asking "whrat
proportion of Post Masters are friendly to
te .preseni Administration?7" The Post
Master General says, that "ion the first
of December last, thereivere 12,553, Post
Masters in the United. States.' Of-these
it is believed, that more than one half are.
politically opposed to the Adininistration."
With these facts staring them in the face,
how can the Whigs complain of proscrip
tion ? Tis true many of them have been
removed. Bitt doubtless for goid reasons.
Many more might be removed. If they
could, they would fill all the offices under
a Government, whose operations they con
tinually impede !. Good patriots that they
are, many of them are willing to take of
flee under this corrupt and most-oppressive
Administration! Trodden down, perse
cuted, as they say they are, how y(do the
Whigs act, when they themselves possess
the power? Like the Puritans of N.Eng
land, and many other religious sects, the
perseciuted become persecutora in their turn.
'It is lament able that wnhenever any, body.
of men possess great power, they exercise
it to the oppression, and very often the de
struction of .all who oppose them. . The
Whigs have not been guiltless in this mat
ter. It is saidl that in Pennsylvania, and
other States where they have had the as
cendency, they have removed from- office
all thie -Democrats whom they could.
They hare swent the chess-board. fMlr
