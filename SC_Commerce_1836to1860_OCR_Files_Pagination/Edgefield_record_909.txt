The Report of thme Committee proposed
that the body should be styled the Sou th
cra and Southwestern Baptist Coniven
tion, and on taking 01) thme first article omf
the Constitution, a motion was made to
strike out Southwestern, which gave rise
to a protracted debate, ini which - several
gentlemen expressed their views.
It was urged on the par of the advo
cates of striking out, that Southern 'was
more definite, shorter and was sulficient ly
expressive to cover thme whole ground.
They mneanit no disrespect to their Sooth
western brethren, bitt preferred thme shorter
and more expressive term.
*On thme oilier hand, thoseopposed to stri
king out, expressed their fears that their
constituents would take exceptions to a
term so sectional, and might think that
their feelings had been disregarded. &c.
Upon these points the gentlemen wvho
engaged in the discussion enlarged and en
forced their views with much eat-neatness,
though in tbe kindest feelinge.
[Of this debate we took ample notes,
but at the ime of writinig out this notice
we have tnot time to ptrepare them for the
press, nor is it indeed ltmportant.]
The motion to strike out the word South
western prevailed by a decided majority,
and the article was then adopted.
The remainitng articles were considered
serintitm and were adopted genlly with
out alteration or objectiou, as they came
ft-em the Committee.
- Having gone through with the several
articles, the Preamble and Constitution
were then adopted by a unanimous vote.
When, at the suggestion of thme President,
the Convention united in prayer to return
thanks to the great Disposer of evenits for
the unanimity and good feelitng which had
characterised their deliberations.
Dr. Cary moved, That a Committee of
three be appointed to prepare anm address
to the public, setting forth the reasons
whbich have led to the formation of the
Southern Bap'tist Convention, the neces
sity ofgueir an orgainization, and giving
an exposition of its principles and objects,
which shall be published in connexion
with the minutes of this body, and in such
* publie prints as will allow it a place in
their coluns.
- The Resolution was adopted, and Drs.
Curtis,.Johnson and Fuller, appointed a
Committee.
After the appointment of the Commit tee,
a motion was- made to- re-consider, wit h
a view to increase the number to sevenm,
which gave rise to a protracted running
debate, during which various motions
were made, some of which were after dis
and the Convention (ally determined to
adhere to the number (if three by a very
decided majority.
Mr. Jeter submitted the following
Resolved, That the individuals, church
es, and other bod'ies approving the Consti
tution of the Southern Baptist Convention,
adopted by this body, be recommended to
meet for organization under the Constitu
tution, by tenbers-or delegates, accor I
ing to its provisions. on ----, at ---,
and that this Con'vention now prcceed.to
the election of officers and boards, to con
tinue in office until the contemplated
meetings.
This gave rise to a discussion pending
which the Chair suggested a doubt, as to
the powers of the Convention to proceed
to organize even a provisional government.
This led off into a new field of debate.
and before any action was taken, the Con
vention adjourned till 3 o'clpek, P. M.

WEDINESDAY, MAi 21, 1845.
" Me will cling to the Pillars of the Tenrple of
Our Liberties, and if it must fall, ec wwill per.
ish amidst the Ruins."
07TEMPERANCE NorTIc.--We are reques
to state that a meeting of the Mechanics Wash
ingtonian Society, will be held on Thursday
evening next. A full attendance of the mem
bers is earnestly requested. and the citizens
generally are respectfully invited to attend.
We are also requested to state, that the Dis
trict Temperance Society wjill appoint dele.
gates to represent them at the meeting of the
Edgefield Distrie.t Temperance Society- to be
holden on the 1st Tuesday Evening of June
Court On which occasion, Air Bowman, ed
itor of the Temperance Advocate, will make
an Address.
Erratum.-In our last, for .Mr. Harvard,
President of Harvard College. read Mr. Quin
cy. None of your tricks .1r. Devil, upon
printers? The person from whom Harvard
Urni versity takes its came, has been dead for
many generations. We seldom notice errors,
as our readers can generally correct them, but
we have thought proper to notice the above, as
it is onein point of fact.
Rain.-On Thursday. morning last, rain
commenced falling quite abundantly. and can
tinnpd nearly the entire day, almost withont in.
termission. This was the best season which
we have had in'this section of country, during
the present year. The crops of oats, corn,
&c., are greatly revived, and if we should be
favored with good seasons hereafter, plenty
will yet smile upon us. For some days after
the rain. the weather was cold.
The account of the proceedings of the Bap
tist Convention which recently assembled at
Augusta, Georgia, fills much space in our paper
to-day, and excludes much other matter. For
this we deem no apology necessary. as the
greater portion of our readers take deep inter.
est in these proceedings. The action ofthe
Convention we believe will meet the warmap
proval of nearly the entire South, perhaps ul
titnately the whole South. This body has done
nobly. in resisting the abolition feeling of their
northern brethren at the beginning. We
trust that this prompt and decided action of
Southern Baptists. will prodtice a beneficial ef
fect throughout the Union.
Electro Magnetic Tdegraph.-It is supposed
that a line of Electro Magnetic Telegraphs will
be completed between New York and Phia
delphia, ip about three months.
II'hig Concentionr in Georgia.-The Whai's
have deterumined to hold a Conventiotn at
hI ilteligeville, Ga., on the first Monday the 7th
of July. tfor the purpose of nominating a Whig
candidate for Governor.
Sir 1h&er Peel, and tcherisha Calholies.-Sir
Robert Peel recently proposed a Parliamentary
grant for the inmprovemennt of the education of
Roman Catholic students at hlayndorth. A
large r~nmnber of the supporters of the estah
lished Church are op~posed to it, hut it is
thouaght that thme measure will succeed, as it
will greatly wend to the political pacification
of Ireland. A betneficial effec-t has already been
produced in Irelanid, from the mtero anounce
ment of the prop~ositioni. Daniel O'Connell
the great agitator has postponed his intended
mteeting of the people at C lnotarf. Agitation
is sttbsiding, and O'1Conniell evinces a desire to
harmonize with Peel in plans for the ameliora
tioni of Irelatnd. The Roman Catholic Clergy.
and several Prelates oif the Catholic C'hurth,
have forwarded to the Premnier their expres
sion of thanks fur his conduct. If things con
tintue to go on thus smnupthly, we may sootn say
of O'Connell, -
"Othello's occupation's gone."
The subjoined complimenatary notice of the
Rev.;Wm. B. Johnson, President of the recent
Southern Baptist Convention, we copy frota
the correspotndence of thc Charleston Patriot.
'-The Convenitipn adjourned with prayer
bmy Dr~. Johnson; he w as deeply touching
and fervent. Your State cannot appre
ciate too highly the many high qualities
of this her eminently able and pious son.
He has, throughout the whole..meetiung
and-tnnder. all its circumstances of toil and
difficulty, presided over the deliberation,
of thle Convention with aill the urbanity of
a finished gentleman and the skill . of an
able officer, well cotnversant with parlia.
mentiary procedin gs. H is Secretaries sus
tained him with great eredit to themnselves.
WVe night particularly metntion Mr. Cranus,
of Virginia, wvho, for all the qualities of a
gentleman and a man of busitness, we
have never seen surpassed. But these
are persontal maatters-which can have but
lit tle general interest, and we really -have
nothing more to write about. We hardly
know why wye were' tenipted to say any
thing at all."
Sil:crand.-From late foreign papers, we
learn that a civil war which has been for some
time bre wing, has at length broken out ip.thmis
country. ,It appears to be among then adher.
ents of time Protestant and Romain C'atholic de.
nominiations.
"The accounts ftrom Swvitzerlsnd states.
that t hat country bad become thme scene of
a bloody conteet between the ri'.alreligiain
ists, at tended with serious losa of life. The
free corps, which invaded the Canton of
Lucertie, like Fallstaff's raw reenaits. got
pretty well "peppered.'' as they were the
aggressors, and conducted thernselves. sri
. asnt neutralize sympathy, their fate ex
cites little regret. More than 600 of them
perished in the conflict of retreat. It is a
libel on the enlightenment of the nine
teenth century, to see men coolly butcher
eachother for mere speculative points of
religion. These ruptures, if continued,
will probably lead to the dismemberment
of the Swiss Cantons, and its partition
among the adjacent powers of Europe."
* h77 Proposed Pacific Rail Road.-Mr. A.
Whitney in a circular bearing date April 23d,
Washington, says :
"It is my intention to pass over. exam
ine, and partially survey seven or eight
hundred wiles of the proposed route for
:he Railroad from Lake Michigan to the
Pacific.
I shall leave New York about the 26th
of May for Green Bay. follow the Lake
down to Milwaukie, thence west to the '
Mississippi river, and return by St. Louis.
Several young gentlemen of high res.
pectability and education will accompany
me, and it will please me to have our
number increased."
For the Advertiser.
To the Physicians of Edgeseld
District.
GEaTLEntEI:-Believing that the honor ant
dignity of our profession may be seriously af
fected, and is even already much injured, par.
ticularly in the country, by a want of that uni
formity of conduct among the members.of the
profession. which is so essential to its main.
tenance: and feeling it to be the duty of the
members oif'the proteasion. to remove as far as
possible.any cause which have a tendency to
detract from the respectability, honor and dig.
nity oft tat profession, we feel ourselves sus.
taitned in c:iltng the attention of the Physicians
of Edgefield District, at least to the considera
tion of a subject which must be lookedupon as
one of the great causes in producing the .ef
fects above alluded to-the want of. a regular
fee hill, a uniforn system of charges, by which
all shall be governed.
The dignity, the respectability and-the honor
of the profession require the adoption of'such
a system, and it is due the- people, that a fee
bill be adopted in accordande with .the times.
We. therefore, calkon .the practisiug Physi.
cians-of Edgefleld District,to meet at Edge.
field Court Clouse,on the first 5londayin July
next, at 2 o'clock, P. M., on that day to assemble
together in somie suitable room, and adopt
such a bill of charges as the times ahd.circunm.
stances require.
Afler which, the 'meeting might take into
consideration other-suhjects. - And one which
will be well worthy of its consideration is,
the propriety of establishing a Medical Society
or Societies in Edgefield District. The utility
of which. if propeily ccoudtcted. both as re
gards advancing the science of Medicine and
the benefits to the conuunity, must be ac
knowledged by all, .
We flatter ourselves that the inmportance of
the subjects will be suffiicient to idanec every .
mermber of the. profession in our District to
take a deep interest in- the neettn, and to at.
tend, prepared for the-transaction of the busi
ness above tientioned.

itself upon the mind of the reader. We

AlAIL AND WAR STEAMERS.
The interference of Great Britain with
the peaceful annexation of Texas to .tho
Uttited States, and the tone of defiane
recetntly asumed in the British Parlia
menit, towards this country, retader it at
once expedient for us to turti our ateusiotn
io the soahonrd and the navy. -The first
thing that strikes the eye mn ooking sea
ward, is the tremuendous steam p)ower of'
Great Britain on the oceant, adapted for
immediate concenitratton upotn our own
coast.' The Brtitish WVest India royal
tmail line co~nsists of fourteen steam.
era, that average eighteen hundred tons
burthen. The C'unard line -of steainers
incieuse the tnumber to soine twenty-odd :
All of these vessels can be anchored on
our shores simultaneously with the declar-.
ation of wvar from Great Britain. And
to encounter them, when duI3 artmed and
equipped, our whole navy would be inade
qtuate. -Of steam ships. we have - the'
Princeton. the Mississippi and Fulton, and
some fifty sailing ships of all sizes. BEtt
in efliciency the whole of them taken
together would be itiferior, far-inferior, to
the British W~est India and Cunard line
of stea'nters combined. In no state of the
wind could a sailing vessel overtake 'a
steamer bent on escape; whilst a few
steamers, iD a Calmn, could attack in detail
our whole force of sailers and destroy them;
There is no longer any reliance 'in. such
nsutical skill as saved Old Ironsides,. du
ringthe lste war from the pursuit of the
four British ships. We must .be- perm'it
ted to saythat it- is-little to the credit of
our country and Goverpment, where
steam navigation was first taught to the
world by a Fitch arnd a Fuhtou,- that the
obvious advantages, of such an invention,
for warlike operations, should be. almost
monopolized by anether and a riyal power.
And is adds to our .mortification to consid
er that a large pai-t of the expense of sup
porting this great, and dangerous foree, is
-derived frotns.oura qwn commerce, and
mnuch of it from a .qeighhqring trade that
ought to be ours. The Cudar~d line isup
ported, by the. trade between- Boston god

Cunard and W~est India line'are by con
TracI subject to be- takien at any imomtent
for Government use,. and armed and
equipped for the Ryal navy.
The manner in. which our own and the
neighboring trade and trael are thus
made io support an overwhielming force,
susceptible at any day of being directed
that the convention ivould.not only exhibil
a laudable example of moderation and for
bearance, but would keep strictly within
the limits and provisions of the "plar, of
separation" which had been adopted by
the last general conference with such great
unanimity. For himself, he stood up on
the basis of Methodiam as i: was laid
down in the book of Discipline. From
that rock he never intended to be moved.
With regard to the kind and cordial invi
tation they had given him, on yesterday,
to preside over the convention, he begged
to say, after having calmly and carefully
weighed the subject in all its bearings and
consequences, that he would accept it.
His excellent colleague, Bishop Andrew,
was of the same mind. They felt they
should only perform a duty they owed to
the church in so doing. Their excellent
and worthy colleague, Bishop Morris. for
reason perfectl: satisfactory. and which
he (Bishop Soule) consitlered altogethe
right, declined participating in the duties
of the chair. He trusted that every thing
would be done in that spirit which would
be acceptable in the sight of God, and in
strumental in the salvation of the soul of
men.
At the close of the Bishop's remarks.
Dr. Pierce arose and conducted the vener
able man to the chair.
Rev. J. Early offered the following res
olution. which, after some remarks from
Drs. Smith and Bascomb, was adopted:

On tmotion of Dr. Longstreet, it was re
solved that no memorial, received after
Tuesday next, should be referred to thte
cotmmit tee, and a motion was made to
adjourn, so, that the committee could have
time to pre'pare busiuess for the cornvention.
The motion to adjourn was waived, and
an' extended debate took place on a tmotion
to reconsider thte resolution appointing a
committee to furnish a report of the pro
ceedings. Some members objected to
having any report sent out as official that
was not complete, whilst the committee
contended that the resolutions under which
tbey acted only called otn thetm for a sy
nopsis of the proceedings. The report oh
the remarks of Bishop Soule, on taking
the chair, which we published a few days
since, was said- to be incorrect.
Mr. Green, of Tennessee, said lhe would
like to see Bishop Soule's address its fulli
