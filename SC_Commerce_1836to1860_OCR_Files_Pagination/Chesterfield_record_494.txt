Oj the aruficud division of the Farm.
Every farm, whether large or small, I
whether the soil be of good or bad utility,
should be divided into at least six fields,}
for the arable land; in addition to which,

ii would be well to have three lots o
about one acre each, near the barn 01
dwelling house. There should generally
be kept, two in grass for calf pasture,
?the other to be tilled, in rotation, in po
tatoes and other roots and vines. But as
we anticipate objections to this divider
on account of the quantity of fencing re
quired, it is proper that we say something
Of the materials for fencing.
Chesnut and cedar, for rails, answer the
best purpose, and will commonly lasi
about one hundred years, if they be kep;
from the ground, and if the bushes anc
briars be not permitted to grow up b)
their side. That winch is commorm
called worm fence is thought to answei
the best purpose for outside fences; foi
division there are several choices. Pos
and rail, the posts made of locust, cedai
or chesnut, answers a good purpose.?
Stone fence may do when distant from th:
buildings; hut it always serves as a har
hour for rats and other predatory animals
yet when the materials are at hand it is r
good way ot using them on aecoun
of their durability. The foiiiidalioi:
should be laid below frost.
Hedge fence, when constructed of thorn
is too slow of growth: that on the Orangt
o r
farm, n 'ar Baltimore, has, to the know
ledgi of the writer, been planted more
than twenty-five years; and it cannot a
this time !>. considered as a perf < t'y salt

the several substitutes th.it have beet
mentioned for thorn there is none that ap
pears to us so appropriate as the M,rn.<
Mtdtiraa is. It is quick of growth, tena
eious of life, may be propagated to at
unlimited extent by layers; and may hi
so wattled and interwoven as to form ur
inmpcrable barrier, in a few years, to al
ordinary animals. Besides, silk-worm?
may be fe l on its foliage, a citcumdancf

trees by the side of a!! our division fences,
that by tiie time the fences are decayed
we may have a tiring fence, which shall

From the knowledge the writer
has of this tree he is of opinion that n

live years.

answer an excellent purpose; cornstalk*
and weeds, and for want of something
better, bark that has been used by tanner;
will answer; sea ware, sea weed, or sea
grass is excellent for manure. It will ol
course be proper to prevent the watei

would carrv otf much of the valuable pari
of the manure. In favor of leaves as a
manure may be mentioned the fact that
they are the principal supply, afFordci

support, and that notwithstanding tin
immense growth of wood and timber sucli
lands produce and sustain, they are 1>\

LIME. Of all the blessings bestowed

, hand of an all-wise Creator, next to pun
I water, p rhaps should be placed Lime.?
I It has been well observed that those sub.
i i stances most essential to the life of man
j have by the goodness of divine provi
i deuce been distributed in the greatest
abundance, and over the greatest c\ten
i ~
* ' of the globe. This is certainly the casi
[ , with water, which covers a great portior
I of if, an 1 without which man could no
I lon<r exist. So with lime, which form*
" n
. 1 whole chains of mountains, isn component
r part of all soils, is a constituent part o
:110s! grain, and enters essentially into the
formation of man, as well as the lowei
> grade of animals. So far as cheinica
; j science has developed the resources ol
I . nature, i'rnc is believed to he the only ar
: tide that can give permanent fertility ti
soils; and from the most accurate cxperi
i mentsthat have been made, on very lerfile
soils, they have been found to contain
, at least one-tenth part of lime. In a soi

L .above staled, mailing can be easier, 01
f the part of the good husbandman, than t(

; ! This is the only substance that can b<
i obtained by agriculturists, generally, ii
L such quantities and at such prices as wil
t admit of its use as a manure, for a re

, in various ways; but that which has beer
j j found best is to spread it on a grass sod
i soon after it is slacked, and wiiilo in ?

t cess is more essential than at a first view
^: may occur to casual observers. If tin

) the application of but 50 bushels at once, J t
? which quantity may be repeated until the J i
) requiste ferti.ity is obtained. Let it be J c
- observed that I speak of utisl ached lime, j i
when I mention these quantities.
It would not be proper to attempt to ( 1
lime more than one Held a year, and but s
few can accomplish that, if the field be J p
large; in this way the profits, derivable j \
from liming, will, after the first year, i v
nearly cover the expenses ; or at any rate '1
they will greatly assist in the operation. I;
Let no one however be too sanguine f
- . O # J
ofgreat and immediate profits; they will i t
come somewhat slow, but sure. In some ! p
instances the afy intages of liming have r
been made in such an almost impercepti- i
blc manner that farmers have been dis- ! t
couraged. Generally, however, those who i
have used lime are pleased, and regret 1
that they have not the means of doing it t
more extensively. j t
Lime, like all other alkaline manures, j t
r should be kept some time on the surface, (
for the purpose above mentioned,?that i
it may be dissolved, and that the soil may
, become saturated with the ley. It should . <
. not be wet and lumpy when spread, or it 1 <
will not be dissolved ; but become a car- (j
* bonate, and do but little good. It never 1 <
. loses any thing bv evaporation, and in ' <
r that respect it is unlike the two former j I
> kinds of manure, which we have noticed.
; Some eight or ten years ago, a Mr. <
Nelson, of ihis couuty, commenced lim- ?
i ing his land atari expense of twenty dol.
i lars per acre. He was one of the first, <
perhaps the very first, and his neighbors
1 thought he was crazy. They found, i
- however, in a few years, when a field of <
i twenty acres produced four hundred j
t barrels of corn?that is 2,000 bushels of i
i shelled corn?that there was " method in :
i his madness."
As it regards the price at which a farm- j
cr can afford to use lime as a manure, it
must he regulated by the price of wheat.
According to my estimate, a bushel of i
wheat should pay for five or six bushels
of lime delivered on the fartn.
It may be expected that we should offer
our views as to the modus operandi of
lime ; this part of the subject we approach
with some diffidence, and without any
pretension to freedom from error ; but as
we have embarked on the troublesome ocean
of philosophical speculation, we may,
as well as our compeers, hazard a conjecture,
leaving it to our readers to judge of
its accuracy.
Lime cannot long remain in the soil as
a clax, calcium, or quick lime ; but by its attraction
of carbonic acid from the atmosphere,
it becomes a carbonate. In this
| primary action of absorbing carbonic acid'
! a portion is at the same time taken up by
I the plant. IIui why, it may be asked, is ;
; lime so durable iu its effects upon the soil ?
. i Thai lim?> bus lb? effect of looseninff a
J ' ---- --- - . CT
; heavy, clayey soil is a point conceded by !
, : ail w ho liavc used it on such soils. I do j
| not believe, with professor Ducat el and 1
11 .some other chemists, that the oxalic, or
! j any other\fr<x acid exists to any con.si<fci';
able extent in any soil; lime then is ;to/
i i necessary to neutralize an acid in the
I J soil. Calcium, or quick Jime is more I
i readily dissolved than the carbonate ; and
t as almost all plants, and particularly' i
1 wheat and oats, contain a portion ol'liine ^
i they may receive it as a part of their nc- J
r cessary food in this way. Carbonate of
1 lime, or lime stone, requires a much larger '
I quantity of water to dissolve it, ncverthe
less it is while in the soil always undergo- ' i
) ing a slow decomposition, and is thus taken 1
up by the plant. j
It is admitted by all who have used j
i lime on such soils, that it renders clayey :
I ones lighter and sandy soils more compact. |
* The experiments of the writer Have been
> on a soil of the first description?argil lac- ;;
< eons?and before he used lime he had 1
? great trouble in pulverising it. Land that I
) was limed five or six years ago is at this '
i time quite sufficiently pulverulent and fri- j
able.
i How docs lime produce this effect? Is;
i it merely such a mechanical division as is
1 effected on c!ay with sand, or is it some- j
- thing different ?
1 Certain bodies, although they may not !
i enter into chemical union, attract each J
, other?repulsion is a property of other ;
i bodies. Let us take quicksilver for in- ;

I toseperatc them, they form into innume* j

i .substances it will enter into chemical un- i
- ion?with others it will form no such i
3 compound. We never see, nor hear of, a !
0 carbonult of quicksilver. It will mix with
- some metals as an amalgam. Tin, lead,
silver, gold, are ( f this class ; but it will
? not mix with iron. There is such a pow1
orful repulsion existing b. twecn turpentine
and this metal, that the more you attempt
s to unite them the more the metal Hies in- j
?f to a million parts and utterly refuses an j
g admixture until it is reduced to an iinpal- !
a pable powder or oxide. Iloney of the
y same consistence will not have any such
> effect.

Is ?aliuminum?others deny this to clay ;
n but it does not destroy our hypothesis j
which is this ;?that lime and clay are !
two distinct heterogenous bodies; and

or attraction for each other, they are de

:ided!y repellent, and that in attemptir^ a
o mix them they not only refuse to come o
n contact, but fly asunder like the balls I
if an electrometer?or the dust from setting
wax excited by electricity. n
If it be said that the division is median- 11
cal, and such as would be effected by \
and, wo deny the assertion, and can f
rove to the contrary in two ways. 1st. f
iVe say that the same quantity of sand fi
vill not have the same effect on clay. 2d. t
rhat a solution of lime will cause clay to t
lecome friable. Then besidj the natural
bod which lime affords to plants it loosens ii
be stifl'clayey soils, and renders them ?
lertneable to their roots in search of their a
lecessary aliment. t
If it be true, as is asserted by many, 11
hat lime renders sandy soils m >re cohes- c
ve, it follows as a corollary of what has o
>ccn said concerning lime and clay, that c
he other two are more neurogenous in i
heir nature ; that a kind of adhesive at- I:
raction exists betweeen them, thus ren- ?
Icrinjj such soils more retentive of inois- i
;ure. i
These arc merely speculative opinions
3t the writer which may not be new to \
others; they are so however to him. He a
Attaches no great importance to them; t
^et thinks them quite as reasonable as c
5.,me others that have been propagated on t
ligher authority. (
We shall probably elucidate the action \
jf lime more fully when we come to (
>peak of gypsum or sulphate of lime. I
Ashes after I hey have been used by the <
snap boilers, commonly called spent ashes- 1
Although ashes, strictly, area vegetable
manure, yet on account of the simiiiariiy s
of principle and mode of action we have i
thought proper to arrange them with the
mineral manures. The essential salt of , I
ashes is well known in commerce under <
the name of potash. It is the vegetable i
alkali, and bears in its properties, a strong
resemblance to the mineral alkali or soda.
Like lime, this manure losses nothing
by evaporation ; but its tendency is to
sink. One hundred bushels of these to
the acre, serve as an excellent dressing for
wheat, and will last five or six years.
Ashes arc prompt in their action, and are
therefore by some preferred to lime. It
is probable that more advantage is to be
derived from using the two together than
o o
from using either separately.
For corn a compound of three parts
ashes and one part plaster, a handful put
in each hill, is found to answer an excellent
purpose.
Barbilla is a nnme applied to a very
impure carbonate of soda, imported, from
the East Indies, and used by the soap boilers.
To get it freed from the quantity
of carbonic acid it contains they are obliged
to mix with it about one-third of lime.
The compound, after the alkali is extracted,
is sold uuder the name of Barbilla ashes.
They arc sold about two cents a
bushels less than the aiach ashes, Out are
not worth half as much. They have
been used to some exteut as manure.
Nil rate of Soda is said to exist in large
quantities in Atacama in Peru, South j
America, whence it is imported. It may i
be obtained for about three dollars a hundrid
pounds, and probaoly could he oh- ,
taiileo for less in large quantities, as it is <
said to be vtv abundant in the earth over |
a large district. Its effects on grass, a
bout one hundred pounds to the acre, a c ?
said to be good. From the appearand i
and nature of the arti - e I am inclined to
the o| iniori that it may be used to some ,
extent as a renovator of worn out soils. .
Sulphate, of lime gypsum, sclcniic or .
plaster of parls?Next to lime th s is the ,
most important article among mineral ma- {
nurcs. This salt is found in large beds or
lasers in different parts of the globe aid (
particularly at Montmartrc, near Paris,
and at Nova Scotia, on this continent, i
That which is used as manure is net by ,
any means a pure sulphate of lime, for it |
contains a large quantity of carbonic acid; |
it is therefore u mixture of calcareous sul- |
phate and calcareous carbonate. The col- ,
oring matter is cither from vegetables or |
iron. The properties of this salt are but ,
little understood and not properly estima- .
ted. That so small a quantity as one j
bushel, or a little overone hundred pounds ,
by weight, should when strewed over an
acre of clover produce such surprising |
effects as to increase the crop two-fold ,
is beyond common comprehension. Hut
its effects are not confined to clover, al- (
though its use is nearly so. It has been
tried in various species of vegetables with
equally good eMeets.?The great error in
using it is by putting on too small quantities.
Another error is in putting it invariably
on the surface instead of in the hill.
The writer, last year, tried it on potatoes
in the hill, with surprising advantage.
The crop, with the exception of two rows
was planted in the usual way, with a lib- rul
supply of manure in the hill. Those two
rows had no manure applied, hut were
planted by strew ing plaster or gypsum on
them pretty freely before they were covered
with earth. They received the same
kind of culture, and when they were dug
in the fall were fully equal in size, weight
and flavor to those planted with manure.
These were Irish potatoes ; but there is J
not a doubt that gypsum would be found '
equally beneficial on sweet potatoes. On
corn and most garden vegetables it has
been used in the saine way with decided
and unequivocal benefit. The corn crop
of the writer was last year dressed on the
hill, soon after it was planted with lime

Ve have been informed by an intelligent
ariner in an adjoining county, that he a
ew years ago, strewed gypsum over hi*
iold of corn, broadcast, about one bushel
o the acre, with surprising advantage to
he crop.
In Lancaster and York counties, Penn.,
t is a very common practice to strew
;ypsum over the wheat in the spring, say
,bout the 1st April. We have never tried
his, but intend to do so in a few days, U
nay he a proper, however, to mention an
ibjection which has some wpight. A
;reat deal of wheat in this seeiion of

nilky state, by rut/. Gypsum is said to
lave the effect of keeping the wheat
rrcen, and thus of retarding its ripening

When we ex amine into the cause of
vhat is ca'led rust, wo are compelled to
admit that there is some considerable
orce in the argument. Rust in wheat
kxuis only in very wet seasons, with verv
varm close weather and fogs. The disease
is occasioned by a bursting of the sap
vessels, from repletion of moisture. This

]>ut whether the premises from which
these conclusions are drawn be not erroneous
admits of investigation ; and as thrs
t;an he best made bv actual experiment.,
we 3hall make it the present season. Our
farm is very small and may be considered
as an experimental one : but small as it
is we find we can make nrore char than,
our neighbours who possess large farm*
of poor half cultivated fields. We havetwo
lots of wheat of the same kind, whkebearded
winter wheat. (friiicum turgidurrh

same size and quality ; we shall sow both

may be communicated hereafter to the
public for * hose good our labors hav<?
been principally directed, as well in husbandry

All seed grain should be washed or soaked
before being sown or planted. The
great advantage of washing seed wheatcan
oniy be known to those who have tried it.
A large quantity of light wheat, chess,
trarlic and other filth rnav thus be removed.

(armor should sow impure seed ; he
had better pay double price for (hat which
is clean. Seed corn, and indeed nearly
ill seeds would he the better for being
soaked and rolled in plaster before being
sown or planted. Lime would answer
nearly the same purpose, but it might he
injurious to the I..a :ds. Brine, of pickle,
moderalely strong, should he used for
washing wheat; as it is more buoyant and
causes a greater number of worthies*
grains to swim on its surface. The bene-,
fit of rolling seed grain in gypsum will bo
apparent by the healthy and vigorous
shoot which will be sent forth iu the gen
initiating process.
As we have ventured to advance our
opinions on the modus operandi of lime,
so we will again expose ourself to the
shafts of criticism by offering our views
an the action of gypsum. It is, at the
most superficial glance,evident that some
agents are concerned in the product, occasioned
by the application of this salt to
if>?rnt?hlos. hesido the material itself.

That pulverised gypsum has the power
of absorbing moisture from the atmosphere
has been proved by actual experiment.?:
A certain quantity by weight, having beca
exposed a few days, shortly after having
been ground, has been found by absorption
to have increased to some extent; but
not sufficiently to account for the phenomena
noticed in its productive powers..
The mild solution of gypsum is a peculiar,
ly fit food for plants; as by its stimulant
property it enables the plant piore fully to
dcvelope itself, and draw such other supports
to its aid as may he prcseul in the
soil or atmosphere.
From observing the surprising effects of
gypsum in promoting the growth of vege.
