Sermon on Universalis*!.
Genesis hi. 4.?And the Serpent said
unto the Woman, Ye shall not surely die ?
The holy scriptures are a peculiar fund
of instruction. They inform us of the origin
of creation ; of the primitive state
of man : of his fall, or apostacy from God.
It appears that he was placed in the gar.
den of EJen, with full liberty to regale
himself with all the delicious fruits that
were to be found, except what grew on
one tree?if he eat of that he should surely
die, was the declaration of the most
high.
Happy were the human pair, amidst
this delightful paradise, until a certain
preacher, in his journey, came that way,
and disturbed their peace and tranquility,
by endeavoring to reverse the prohibition
- - \y _
of the almighty, as i:t our icxi?xe
shall not surely die."
" Siie plucked, She ate ;
Earth felt the wound ; nature from her
seat, Sighing through all tier works, gave
signs of wo,
That all was lost." mtltox.
We may attend, To the character o 1
the preacher?To the doctrine inculcated
?To the hearer addressed?To the med'f
11m or instrument of the preaching.
1. As to the preacher, I w< uld observe,
he has rnanv names given him in the sacred
writings, the most common is the
Devil. That it was he that disturbed the
felicity of our first parents,is evident from
2 Cor. xi. 3, and many oilier passages of
scripture. He was once an angol of light,
and knew better than to preach such doctrine?he
did v iolence to his own reason.
But to he a little more particular, let it
be observed,
1. He is an old preacher. II lived nhove
one thousand seven hundred years
before Abraham?above two thousand
four hundred and thirty years before Moses,
four thousand and four^vears before.
Christ. It is now five thousand and eight
hundred and nine years since he common
ced preaching.?By this tiino he must
have acquired great skill in the art,
2. He is a very cunning artful preach?
r. When Klymns the sorcerer, came to
turn away people from the faith he is said
to b a full of a'i svbUc'ij . rn I a child of the
decii?not only because lie was an enemy
of all righteousness, but on account of his
. careful cunning and craftiness.
3. He is a very laborious unwearied
preacher. He has been in the ministry
almost six thousand years ; and yet his
zeal is not in the least abated. The apostle
Peter compares him to a roaring lion,
walking about, seeking whom he may
devour. When God inquired of this persevering
preacher, Job ii. 2 " From whence
comest thou ?" he 4k answered the Lord and
said, from going to an lfro in the enrth and,
from walking up and down in it." He is
far from being circumscribed within
the narrow limits of parish, state or continent
lines; but his haunt and travel is
very large and extensive.
4. He is a heterogenous preacher, If I
may so express myself. He makes use
of a bible when he holds forth, as in his
sermon to our saviour, Matth. iv. 6. He
mixes truth with error, in order to make it
go well or to carry his point.
5. He is a very presum'uous preacher.
Notwithstanding Go i has declared in the
most plain and positive terms, " Thou
shu't surely die"?or " In dying thou shall
die"?yet, this audacious-wretch had the
impudence to confront Omnipotence, ana
say, 44 Ye shall not surely die.''
6. He is a very successful preacher. He
draws a great number after him. No
preacher can commnd horor.s like him
He was successful! with our first parents
?w ith the old worlh Noah once preached
to those spirits that are in the prison of
hell; and told them from God that they
should surely die; but this prcacharcame
along and declared the contiary? Ye shall
not surely die. The greater part it seems,
believed him. and went to destruction. So
it was with S<x!om and Gomorrah and
?Lot preached to them; the substance
of which was, 44 Up, get ye out of this
place: for the Lord will destroy this city. J
Gen. xix 14. hut this old doclaimer told
thpm \n dancer! no danger! Ye sha'l
1 ",v"v r? o
not surely die. To which tlicy generally
gave heed ; and Lot seemed to them as
one who mor/ee/?Tbc-y believed the universal
preacher and were consumed ; agreeably
to rhe declaration of the Apostle
Jude, Sodom and Gomorrah and (he cilics
about them suffering the vengeance of eternal
fire
II. Let us attend to the doctrine inculcated
by this preacher. Ye shall not
surety die. Bold assertion! without a
single argument to support it. Thedeath
contained in the threatening, was doubtless
eternal death?as nothing hut this
would express God's feelings toward sin,
or render a a infinite atonement necessary.
To suppose it to be spiritual death, is to
blend crime and punishment together.
To suppose temporal death to be the curse,
of the law, then believers, are not
delivered from it, according is Gal.
iii. 15. What Satan meant to preacn
was that there is no hell; and that the
wages of sin is not death but eternal life.
III. Wc shall now take notice of the
hearer addressed by the preacher. This
we have in the text, And the serpent said
tinto the wom vx, Ye shall not surely die,
That Eve had not so much experience as
. Adam, is evident; and so was not equally able
10 withstand temptation. This doubtless
was a reason why the tempter chose
her, with whom he might hope to be successful.
Doubtless he took a time when
she was separated from her husband.
That this preacher has had the greatest
success 111 the dark and ignorant parts
of the earth, is evident : his kingdom is a
kingdom of darkness. He is a great enemy
to light. St. Paul gives us some account
of him in his dav?2 Tim. iii. 6.
" For of this sort are they which creep into
houses, and lead captive silly women,
| laden with sins, led away with divers lusts."
i The same apostle observes, Rom. xvi.
I 17, 18. Now 1 beseech you, brethren,
! mark them which cause divisions and of|
fences contrary to the d?ctrine which ye
I have learned, and avoid them. For they
| that are such, serve not our Lord Jesus
i Christ, but their own belly ; and by good ,
; words and fair speeches deceive the hearts
i of the simple.
IV. The instrument or medium made
J use of by the preacher will now be con[
side red. This we have in the text?-And
, the Skrpext said unto the Woman Ye shall
j not surely die. But how catne the devil
i to preach through the serpent ?
I 1. To save his own character, and the
j better to carry his point. Had the devil
come to our tirst parents personally and
unmasked, they would more easily have
seen the deccpfiou. The reality of a future
punishment is at times so clearly imj
pressed on the human mind, that even Saj
tan is constrained to own that there is a
i hell: although at other times he denies it.
j 7 O
He does not wish to have it known that
j lie is a liar; therefore he conceals himself,
I that he can the better accomplish his deJ
.signs, and save his own character.
2. Tuc Devil is an enemy to all good,
| to all happincsg and excellence. He is
(opposed to the felicity of the brutes. He
' took delight in tormenting the swine.
The serpent, before he setup preaching
universal salvation, was a cunning beautliful
happy creature; but now his glory is
j departed. "And the Lord said unto the
: serpent, because thou hast done this, thou
art cursed above aH cattle, and above evej
ry beast of the field : upon thy belly shall
thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the
! days of thy iife.?There is, therefore, a
? Aiinninrr ? n < kn moHnr
I niuu ui uu|;ii?y<iic vuiiiuiig tn inv/ umwivi
; Satan gets the preacher and hears a'so.
| 44 And is not this triumphant treachery,
And more than a mple conquest in the foe;*'
T<>VNO.
S 3. Another reason why Satan employs
instruments in his service, is, because his
I empire is large, and he cannot he every
: where himself.
4. He has h large number at his comm:u:d,
thai love and approve of his work,
! delight in building tip his k;ng loin, and
stand r.'ulv t<? goat his call.
l\fi: n p:\ces.
j 1. The devil is not dead, but still lives ;
: and is able to preach as well as ever. 1 e
skill no? surely die.
2. Universai salvation is no new fangled
scheme, but can boa^t of great an'.iquily.
3. See a reason why it ought to he rejected,
because it fs an ancient devilish
j doctrine.
S?e one reason why it is that Satan is
1. _ i I _ _ \ it. f > t I . 1 a
sum a moriat enemy 10 mc Dime, ana 10 j
j all who preach the gospel, because of (hat
i injunction, Mark xvi. 15, 16. "And hel
said unto them, Go ye into ail the world,
j and preach iho gospel to every creature.
I He 'hat belioveth and is babiized, shall ht.
! saved, hut he that believcth not shall he
I damned.
j 5. See whence it was that Satan exerted
himself so much to convince our first
parents that there was no hell, because
the denunciation of the Almighty was
true, and he was afraid that Adam and
Eve would continue in the belief of it.
Was there no truth in future punishment,
or was it only a temporary evil, Satan j
would not be so busy in trying toconvincc
men that then* is none. It is his nature!
awl element to lie. When hespeaketh |
a lie, he speakoth of his own for lie is a li- j
ar and the father of it." John viii. 41.
0. We infer that ministers should not I
he proud of their preaching.?-If they j
preach the true gospel, they only in sub- i
i stance repeat Christ's sermons. If thev
j preach. Ye shall no! surely die, thev only
j take the devil's old notes, that he de;
live-rod almost 6000 years ago.
i 7. It is probable that the doctrine of
Universal Salvation will still prevail, since
j litis preacher is yet alive, and not in the
least superannuated ; and every effort a1
gainst him only enrages hi.rn more, and j
' excites him to new inventions and exertions
to build up his cause.
1 To close the subject.?As the author of
the foregoing discourse has confined himself
wholly to the character of Satan, he
trusts no one will feci himself personally
i injured bv this short sermon : But should
j any imbibe a degree of friendship for this
( aged divine, and think that I have not
i not treated this Universal Preacher w ith
j that respect and veneration that he
| justly deserves, let them be so kind as to
! point it out, and I will most cheerfully re
tract: for it has ever been a maxim with
j me, " Render unto all their dues."
From the Theological Magazine.
A writer on universal salvation closed
I his piece with the following quotation
i from Pope :
"The seas shall w.tsto, the skies in smoke
. decay,
Rooks fail to dust, and mountains melt
away;
But fixt his word, his saving power remains,
Thy realm forever lasts, ihy own -Messiah
reigns;"
i An antagonist made the following adi
dition to them :
universalis:* indeed.
"When seas shall wasto and skios in smoke
decay,
Rocks tail to dust and mountains melt
away;
In adamantine chains shall death ho hound.
And hell's grim tyrant feel the eternal
Wound."
But all his children reach Pi r Eder.'s shore,
Not e'er to see their father Satan moie.
Tito tottering drunkards shall to glory reel,
/.nd common strumpets endless pleasure
feel.
Blest are the haughty who despise the poor,
tor they're cut it 1 .-d to heavenly store
Blest all who I nigh and scoff -t truth divine,
F or bold revilers endless comfort find.
B.est are the clauu'ous and contentious
crew,
To them et-jrnal rest and peace are due.
Blest all who hunger and who tiiirst to
find,
A chance to plunder nnd t<> cIipm mankind, |
Such die iu peact:?lor Goi to luem bus
given
To bo unjust on earth, and go to heaven.
Blest is tbj wretch whose bowels never
move,
With generous p:tv, or with tender lovo,
j He shall find mercy :rom the Hod above.

THE EXERCISES of tins Institution will
be resumed on the second Monday in Junun.
ry next in dor the direction of .Mr. Chmnc/ I'.
Judd as Principa in the Male, and Miss Ann
Tiiroop in the Female Department.
Mr. Judd is a graduate of Yale College, |
has had some experience in teaching and j
presents with his application, a strong certificate
of character and Competency, to teach
from President Day Profesor Sillunan, and thp
res' of 'fie Faculty of Yale, as well as a number
of distinguished references; in this IS'ate.
The object of the course of instruction will
be to tit pupils for any class in college, for mer '
' H _? l-._ ?l'l
cantile pursuits, anaoiner waiK? oi me. i ntmnde
of teaching will be the inductive, pro.
ceeding from truth* Pimple and at once admit,
ted. to those more difficult. Reviews wil be
frequent and rigorous. rI lie scholars improvement
will not be estimated by the space gone
over, nor merely by the number of ideas lie ohtains;
but by the use he can make of them.?
Greek. Latin, and French, will lie taught; and
besides the customary English studies, instruction
will beg.wn in {Surveying. Book-keeping,
and in tin* chief papers ot commerce.
M.fs Tiironp was Educated at the Burlington
Female Seminary in Vermont where lie
cour-e was snffic.ienily thorough to induce
Miss Green the accomplished I'nnciphl of that
Institution to certify m almost unqualified
terms to her competency for teaching in the
most respectable Female Schools: Miss
Throop presents moreover wrh her application
high tea imomals, from sources of distinction
hi this state, where she has taught during
r tie present year.
The Trustees h.vingthus selected Teachers
to their entire satisfaction for both Departments
the ensuing year, qualified in their
ojunio.) to import a thorough, and accomplished
education? they appeal confidently to the
sui rounding country new to cotne up liberally
to the support ul this excellent Institution.
To those who from the absence of such
facilties in educating their children, have to
seek them abroad, this place it would seem
should recommend itself above almostany other.
The Village m winch the School is locaicu i*
considered beautiful, aHd is undoubtedly
healthy it is a'so remarkably tjniet, moral and
even Rel gious having none of those tempta
ions so dangerous to tender age which use
lly infect Villages?such as dissipation, Vice
and immorality of every discriptv n.
Roard may be obtained low in Public or
private houses, and the rates of tuition are
cheap accord.ng to the grades.
The first Session will commence the second
Monday in January and end the second week

SPWJIAI
THE SUBSCRIDER owes tonsid???ble
money much of which he will have 4o pay the
first of January, and he take? this opportunity
of calling on those who are indebted to
him to come forward and make payment. He
wouid not be so presing if he could pay his debts
with promises but those he owes want some-,
thing of more value than a mere promise to J
pay, and he hopes thai such of his customers
as have paid him up in this way heretofore
will find a better currency to pay hiin with;
such a one as will pass to his creditors. He
also takes this method of informing his friends
that his stock of goods is as good as usual,
which he will s< 11 at very low prices for cash
or har'er ;and on good terms to punctual customers:
but he wishes it distinctly understood
thai he cannot give long credits in future; and
those who have owed him longest he hopes
will be the first to pay up.?If all those* who
are indebted to him knew what pleasure it
would give him te receive what they owe him
so as to < nable ium to pay his debts, be issuie
that they would make an extra effort to meet
so just a call.
