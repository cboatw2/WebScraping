period other spmptoms appear, indicating |
rupture or inflammation, or the approach of j
death without either. These, and the treat- !
ment they demand, I ne?d tiot describe. The I
horse niaycther be cured, or a veterinarian
may be obtained before inflammation or other
consequences of the distension can take place.
Treatvienl of Colic.?The treatment con- !
*i?ls in arresting the fermentation, and in
ro.esfaiihshing the digestive powers. There
are many things that will do both. In mild
cases a g-?od domestic remedy in common use
among old-fashioned people who have never ;
heard of inflamed, spasmed, or strangulated
bowels, is whiskey and pepper, or gin and 1
pepper. About half a tumb er of spirits with j
a tvttlgDoonful of pepper, given in a quart ; i
bottle of mi)k or warm water, will often afford j
immediate relief. If the pain do not abate iu i
twenty or thirty minutes, the dose may be
repeated, and even a third dose is in some ;
cases necessary. Four ounces of spirits of}
turpentine, with twice as much sweet oil, is J
much stronger, but if the horse is much averse
to the medicine, turpentine is not always quite ,
s^fe. ... / .
"There is, however, a belter remedy, which .
should always be in readiness wherever sev- ;
eral draught horses are kept. Take a quart'
of brandy, add to it four ounces of sweet!
spirit of nitre, and three ounces of cloves. In
eight days this mixture or tincture is ready
for use; the cloves may still remain in the
bottle, but they are not to be given. Set the :
| bottle past, and put a label upon it?call it the (
"Colic Mixture " The dose is six ounces, to j
bo given in a quart of milk or wtrm water)
every fifteen or twenty miuu'es till the horse !
be cured. Keep his head straight, and not ' >
-too high when it is given. Do not pu I out
his tongue, as some stupid people do when
giving a drink. If the horse be very violent,
?et him into a wide open place, where you will '
ave room to go about him. If he will not
stand till the drink be given, watch him when
down, and give it, though he be lying, when,
ever you can get him to take a mouthful. But
give (he dose' as quickly as possible. After
thai, rub the belly with a soft wisp, walk the
horse about very slowly, or give him a good ;
bed, and roorr. to roll. In eighty cases out of
"ninety this treatment will succeed, provided
the medicine be got over the horse's throat be.
fore his bowels become inflamed, orstrangulat- j
ted, or burst. The delay of half an hour may
be fatal.
When the second does not produce relief, ,
the third may be of double rr treble s renyt h.
I have given a full quart in about an hour, but
the horse was very ill. j 1
In many cases the horse takes ill diring the }j
night, and is far gone before he is discovered l
in the morning. In such a case this remedy j
lotjr prove too late, or it may not be proper ;
ptili, if the belly be swelled, let it be given, un- ,
few the veterinary surgeon can be procured iinmediately.
In all cases it is proper to send for
.him kt the beginning. You or your servants
may not be able to give the medicine, or the
tbseasemay have produced some other, which
this med.cine will not cure. If the vetcrinar.
ian can be got in -a few minutes, do nothing ,
till he comes But do not wait long.
The horse is sometimes found dead in the ,
morning?his belly is always much swelled, ,
and the owner is suspicious of poisoning. I
have known much vegetation arise from such
suspicion, when a single glance at the belly
might hsve shown from what the horse die d

i CULTIVATION OF COTTON IN
BRITISH INDIA.
London Aug, 31*1 1840.
Tlrs subject has for for many years occupVd
tiie attont on of English capitalists,
boi ii is only w>thin the Inst year or two
ih.it uny very serious efforts have been
made to reduce the theories ndvnnced to
uny practical result. There has been ?
-growing anxiety in this country to render
the manufacturer of Cotton goods, if not independent
of the United States for the raw
rn iteriul, at all events less dependent than
' lie hitherto has been; and a ver) strong
| feeling appears to exist here that at no
f very distant day, British manufactured cotton
goods may ho formed entirely of cot.
ton raised in the Indian Empire. Since the
trade lias been thrown open with India, and
monopolies of the East India Company half
1 crushed, i! not annihilated, privuteenterprise
j has been directee to this important brnnch
j of trade, and s-veral of the most scientific
and practical men in the United States, oc.
cupied ii? the growth of cotton, have been
closely quest.onod and consulted as to the
propriety and prospects of similar planta.
(ions on the other side of the Cape of Good
Hopo. From all ihe information that has
y? t been gleaned, the inquirers appear to be
sat.sficd the re is no insuperable bur, rational
ohjec.i m, or even feasible reason, why
j cotton should not be equally as well
j grown in India ns in the South of the Una
ted Slates; and having engaged many firstrate
overseers from Soulii Carolina, it
; seeing iliey are resolved to go seriously and
strenuously to work to test the experiment.
Four gentlemen,of considerable intelligence,
and 'rotn whit I learn, who have been all
their lives engaged upr?n cotton plantations
-I rr .1 o. 1 #,

country wiihin th<> last fortnighf, and are
about proceeding for India, to superintend
plantations, either formed, or about to bo
! torin? d, in the presidencies of Bombay and
Bengal.
Very roeen lv a special meeting of the
Manchester Chamber of Commerce was
convened for express purpose of entertnin.
ing this interesting question, and as the doings
on that orc'is oii are so important to
to your merchanis and southern friends, I
w II endeavor to give you a sketch of the
* proceedings. On the table were three jpecij
mens of lud-a grown Cotton, from the same
' piece of land, and they hail all undergone
J * neoftlie first operations of manufacture."
Two of th? so specimens had been gin!
and in the usu il way. and the third
j had been operated upon by a machine for
j ginning,' cthe invention of Messrs. Fawcett
& Co., of Liverpool, nnd owing to its superior
appearance and cleanliness, was admitted
to be worth "n farihmg to -three
i eights of penny" more than those speci'
me ns which had been prepared in theordi:
onrv manner adop'el in the United States.
The Chairman of the Chamber, Mr. J. B.
Smith, expressed liunself in very sanguine
terms. "There was nothing," he observed,
"in the course which the Chamber had pursued,
that could afford the least ground of jealousy
ou the part of our brethren in the United
j States. The Chamber, he had no doubt, were
; ail wishful that we should deal with our Colonj
ies in their produce, rather than with other
1 and independent countries. Tney had no wish
i tr? mil rlnurn crrnu/fh nf Hntlnn in anv COUn.
.w | b-~ t L y ?7,
try. O? tho contrary, it was their wish
j that it should be cultivated wherever it was
possible."
It appears thai the East India directors find!
ing that a number of spirited individuals had
! resolved upon the cultivation of Cotton in In'
f dia, made a virtue of necessity, and set about
i inquiring into the possibility of the thing for
| themselves. The consequence of their re;
searcheswas a report which Mr. Smith, at tho
; conclusion of his address, introduced and which
: was read to the Chamber,
i That report, framed evidently with great
care and tho result of the minutest investiga.
; tion, is a document almost too important for
condensation, but as it is more than probable
; that you will give it at some futute day, entire,
I will merely run over its contents. It begins
| by stating that "The question of obtaining
cotton from various countries must necessarr
! ly be interesting to a manufacturing community
whose prosperity greatly depends upon a
plentiful and steady supply of the raw material,
since it mmt be obvious that securi y against
the cont n/en ies ol faling crops, political disagreement,
or unsteadiness of price, arising
from speculative combinations, must be in pro
portion to the number of channels from whence
| we derive our supplies." The Chamber is
i then congratulated on the progress made for
! obtaining * an increased supply and improved
quality t>f East India cotton," and a description
is g ven of the successful manner in which
cotton has been cleaned in Bombay. The
mode of performing it, however, is declared to
| bo both slow and expensive, requiring tome
rtkcif>liariirn I cLrill tn mnof fY\a s\+1 inrnrtcn II in.

| supers ble obstacles to a greatly extended proj
duction of cotton jn the colonies. M To aid in
' the enterprise, all transit duties have been aj-boltshed
in Bombay, and the same policy is a*
j bout being adopted in Madras. The Governor
j General 01 India has offered three prizei for the
| growth of a certain quantity and quality of cotion.
The tirst 20,000 rupees?ihe second 10 000
rupees?and the third 5,000 rupees. Captain
Biylis was dispatched by the India goveminent
to the United States for the purpose
of engaging competent persons to superintend
the culture, and has succeeded in his mission.
He is'on the point of returning to India with a
collect iou of a considerable qnantity of seeds,
! and also with several American saw gins for
cleanmg cotton.
The several gentlemen who had consented
to accompany Captain Bayhs from the United
States to the East indies, had been introduced
to the Committee of the Chamber, and had
pointed out to them the deficiencies of Indian
! cotton, " particularly in reference to its clean
lincss and Irregularity of staple, both of whi h I
they expressed confidence in being able to im- |
prove." The same mills have been set up in |
Liverpool, and on the 17th of July last, soine
members ofihe Court of Directors of the East
I tidia Company, With several gentlemen of the
Manchester Chamber of Commerce, assembled '
at the former place * to witness the experiment '
to be made in the machinary for cleaning cot- i
ton." A repetition of these experimentaw as i
also made at Manchester, and the result was |
that the Directors of both bodies 44 consider
those experiment to be, on the whole, highly
satisfactory, as proving, beyond a doubt, the ,
practicability of cleaning I ndia cotton with the
American saw-gin ; although it is evident, at 1
i the same time, that personal skill and expert J
ence will be requisite to adapt the machino to :
the particular species of cotton it is intended l
to operate upon." I
The special report of the Directors of the |
Chamber then goes on to state that - it appears |
to be a very judicious arrangement which the
Hon. East India Company has adopted, viz:
to send over to India, with the machines,sev- '
eral talented and experienced gentlemen, natives
of the United States of America, and
brought up as cotton planters, who will be able
to give a new impulse to the growth of cotton
in India, and to devise and carry into effect
the best methods of driving the saw-gin, and
applying that machine to the very important
purpose of cleaning the cotton so produced."

that with one of these machines 1100 lbs. to
1200 lbs. weight of clean cotton can be pro*
duced per day, whilst the machine used in Iu*
dia, the Chinka, can only prepare from 3d lbs*
to 40 lbs. per day. The machine, also, that
has been invented by Messrs. Fawcett & Co.
is stated to be even a decided improvement
upon the American saw-gin, so that every opportunity
is now given to the growers of cotton
in India to compete with the American market.
The planters who have been engaged from
the United States, are so engaged for five
years, aud their experiments are to be carried
out on a most extensive scale. There can be
i no doubt that with such a wealthy body as the
Lords of Leadenhall street?the Bast India
Company?to back and support thein through
all their endeavors, something will now be done.

Mr. Watkins Leigh, in hi* speech on
Monday, evening, stated some circumstances,
which may be interesting to our readers, at
the present moment, to learn. Mr. Leigh stated
that in the winter of 1814-T5 he was at
Washington, and lodged a*. Crawford's Hotel,
where wore Mr. Webster, Mr. Madison,
Mason, of New Hampshire, Messrs. Gaston
and Stanford, of N. Carolina, and several other
members of Congress?that the Hartford Convention
was the general subject of conversation
' - -that he remembers perfectly well to have
1 conversed with Mr. YVebeter on the subject?
1 that Mr. Webster disapproved of the Convenvention,
as au indiscreet and ill.judged meassure,
although he did not at all believe that
any of its members entertained any purpose of
dividing the Union, or any other evd purpose
whatever.
Mr. Leigh said ho remembered perfectly
well, that h<\ Webster, mentioned the names
of one or mote persons, members of the Convention,
who, he was persnaded, labored rather
to allay than increase the excitement then existing
in New England and the North.,

ars.?We acknowledge the receipt of another
cnnsignuient of caterpillars. They are from
Valeutine Dalton Esq. of Baton Ronge, Mr.
D. informs us .'hat he has about one hundred
t acres planted, snd that on Tuesday last he
discovered the worms had attacked hia cotton,
all of which was destroyed in three days. He
will not realize one-fourth of his anticipated
crop. Sucb intelligence as we daily receive
of the destruction of the cotton crops is truly
melancholy, and the rapidity with which the
caterpillars commit their ravage is quite furi
prising. When once they make their appearance
on a crop its destruction is inevitable.

habit which makes every thing easy, and casts
all difficulties upon the deviation 'from the
wonted couse. Make sobriety a habit, and
intemperance will be hateful and hard; make
> prudence a habit, and reckless profligacy will
be as contrary to the nature of the child grown
an adult, as the most attrocious crimes sre to
any of your lordships.' Give a child the habit
of sacredly regarding the truth?of carefully
, respecting the property of others ; of scrupulously
abstaining from all acts of improvidence
which can involve him in distress, and he will
just as likely think of rushing into the element
in which he cannot breathe, as lying, or cheating,
or stealing.?Lord Brougham.

fumiliar with the history ot tho L) s rihution
the B:ble in South Carolina, remecniier that J
in Deceinber, 2829, a Convention composed
of Delcgutes from our different local B hie ^
Societies, was held at Columbia, which resuited,
it is believed, in the subsequent supply
of almost every part of the S.ule, with
copies of the Word of God.
It is apprehended, however, that the
changes so often taking place in our population,
together with other cnus'-s, mid'T it j
necessary that the same laudable objoat j
should again be undertaken. Accordingly,
another Convention was proposed to.he
held at the same place in Decerning. 1737,
which from untoward circumstances, faded
of afToct.
As there is ground for apprehending,
that the need for continued und active exertions
in this great and good causes, is
scarce!y in any degrcu diminished, the Bible
Soc:e:y of Charleston, reap r.tfully invites
all kindrod Societies throughout the 8 ?*fo,
and the friends of the object generally, to
appoint and send Delegates, to a Convention
proposed to meet at Columbia,, on the
first Tuesday in December next, for the pur.
pose of devising and currying out such measures
as may be deemed best suited to
supply, and keep supplied, every reading individual
in the Commonweal b, willing to
receive it, with a compl 'tu copy of the Holy
Scriptures.
The object commends itself, we tru*\ to
most who are friendly to th* besi interests
of tln ir fellow men. Editors in the S ate,
are respectfully requested to give this paper
an early and prominent insertion in their;
columns; and Clergymen, whoso approbu i
tion it may meet, are earnesly solicied to |
read it publicly to their congregations, at ari
early date, and to co-opcrute in the measti
res proposed, in such way as they may dewn bf-sf.

A Frenchman once trading in market.
was interrupted by an impertinent would be
-waggish sort of a fellow, who ridiculed
him, by immituting his imperfect manner of
speaking the English language. After
patiently listening to him for some iimm, the
Frenchman cooly replied:
"Mine, fine friend, you vud do well to
stop now; for if Samson had made no better
use of do jaw bone of an ass dun you
do, he would never have killed so many
FJistiuns."
TAKEWELL EYES.
A very respectable physician informs us
that he was recently called to prescibe in
the case of a person who was suffering under
a severe chronic tnflimmation of th?*
ryes, one of which was so much disused
to threaten a total extinction of the sight.?
Perceiving that the morbid condition of
these delicate organs was occasioned by
inebriate nabits, and the only hope of their
cure tho entire abandonment of strong
drink, he required his patient to substitute
pure wuter for bis usual spirituous potations,
and the assurance was given that (hit
injunction would ,.b< obeyed. But some
time pass :d aw?iy, and his eyes eviden'ly
row worse; tho physician -knew the cause,
