several q lesfions in reference to the rer-' <
tificare of .1/r, Elward W. Johns >n, np- 1
pen led to Mr. R >!t<i\s publication, to (
whieh I answer as follows :
Your first q lestion is, does he (llr. j
Johnson) speak tho truth, in saving <
in etTbet, that von were in the habit of ,
exch ingingopinions with tho nullification party
of S?uth Carolina ? I
I answer, that I have no knowledge (
of anv correspondence of the kind, nor 1
navo I ever heard of any such before.? ,
You ha 1 none with me. and I infer, from 1
not having heard of any. that you had no 1
correspondence with any inemher of the .
pittv, with whom I w;vi in (hu habit of, <
intercom so. ?
You next a?k if it is In*, ns stated l?v t
hiirt, that when Vour servici*# were de. <

went hevond nullification, and was a (lis. j
inionist, determi ned to devote your future j
life to that cause? T?? which von add <
two other q lestions: Which of von ever 1 |
heard of such a rumor? By which of j |
von will the truth of this statement ho ! (
s istained ? <
I reply, that I never heard of s.jrh a ?
rumor; and that the certificate of Mr. i
Johnston is the first intimation I ever
had that such a one evrsted. It is due I
to yo.i, in addition, to state that I hid
frequent and full conversations wi h \ou
in reference to the revival of the Southern
Review?I think it was ahon' the
tun? to which he refers, in lS.'M. 'The
object in attempting its revival v as to
discus; the questions in which the Suith- i
ern portion of the lrnion was supposed
to he particularly interested, in its com- 11
inercial, political and social relations :j
and on the hotter understanding ?>f which, j
hoih in that and the other sections, its

in review, and I can say, with confidence,
that, in all that pissed, vou did
not uiter a word that savored of disunion.
On the contrary, one of the happy ennse- .
quences anticipated was, that the effects !
of the discussion would tend to counter. |
act causes which had then begun to ope. :
rate, an I which were regarded as hostile
to the Union.
You ne<t appeal to such of the delegation
who m iv have knowledge of the
fact, to state whether vou were not actually
selected to conduct the Southern Re
; view? For an answer, you particularly
j appeal to Col. Preston and mvself.
In answer, I state that such certainly j
was my understanding.
You finally ask. whether Mr. Johnston I
is justified in claiming to be the confidential
organ of the party ?
All I can say is. if he was I was :gnor- 1
' * A i L. t iL ?
ant ol ir. l am noi a warn iii.n in?r? w;jh
any confidential organ, nor did I conceive
that the cause required one. We openly
nnd manfully maintained what we he. j
fieved to be a great constitutional princi-^
pie, which, so far from tending to disui
nioo. was aminen'lv conservative in its j
character. Thus thinking, the m iint'-nanco
of the principles, in our opinion, required
neither disguise nor secrecy on
the part of jis fldv.-catc*. its force consisted
in it* truth, an 1 that on free nnd

Wa?T.ItXGTON, Feh. 12, 1842.
Sir I have tins rnwtjerU received
your note of yesterday, a Id essed to micy
I together With r
t!ir? nullifi- niion party of South-Carolina,
pr? potimling certain inquiries.
In 'egnrri to the objects and designs of
the nulliricatinn party, I have already
thought it expedient, in eonsequer. *e of
the imputations to which you allurle, to
vindicate them in a communication to the
" Intelligencer," and the " Independent,"
signed "A member of the Smith Carolina 1
Legislature from 1626 to 1633 to which
1 bog leave to refer you.
To show to what extent I am able to
asi'iw tlie responsibility of speaking, n? ;
well for others as for myself, in regard to J
any pupose of disunion in that contest.
I beg 'cave to state that, at my instance,
the H use of Representatives of the
Sate .?f South C irolina raised a standing
comm tee on Federal Relations, whose
peculiar duty it was to take cognizance
of the controversy with the General Gov. j
eminent, and that I was chairman of it j
until the contest terminated. This posi-1
lion, of course, made me acquainted with
all the measures proposed, and brought
me in communication with the chief actors
in the politics of that day. iMv residence
was at the Seat of Government,
which afforded me an opportunity of extensive
intercourse with every section of
the State, and with the leading men of
than the nullification party nl South Carolina.
That party had its origin in pure,
disinterested patriotism, and an ardent ;
devotion to constitutional liberty. The
attempt which has been made, by its
enemies and opponents, to attribute to,
that party design* to dis-olve the Union,
is a \ilo calumny. The object was to
perpetuate the Union, and preserve the
integrity of the constitution. NuHifiea.
tion was conservative, in its character,
of theso two objects. Its advocates did
not propose or contemplate voluntary secession,
hut to continue the Union according
to the spirit of the constitution,
as it was ratified hy the different States;
and South Carolina never intended to
separate from theother States, unless she j
should he driven from thorn, in defence of
her principles.
Extract from Gen. Wud.ly Thompson s
reply.
To vnur first question, I answer. that,
from the beginning to the end of the millifi.-ati
n controversy, 1 was in the hnhit
of the fullest and most confidential commnnicntion
with nearly all the leading
men of the party, by letters, in private
consultation, and in caucus, and that,
with one single exception. I never heard a
sentiment of unfriendliness to the Union
uttered01 intimated. Hut, on thecontrary.
the constant declaration of the utmost de
votion to that Union, and a settled opinion
(however mistaken it may have been)
that the greatest guarantee for its per
putuitv was to be found in the recognition
of our principles. There may have Seen
individuals of the party who thought a
1*. TTniort II I
(ll.SiOIUI IWIl wi iik; u ui'iii u< iiiauic, i
can only sav that I never met with such
an one. I confidently assert that if there
were any soch. they did not amount to
on? per cent. <?f the party : and for this
[ appeal to every member of the party of
any prominence in the State. With the
admitted head of that party, Mrt Calhoun,
my relations, political and personal,
were of the mp?t intimate character.
hUtmSttSBBBS^' I
every quarter of it. In endeavoring to
propagate our principles, and rouse tlie
people to th?'ir maintenance, I addressed
popular assemblies in many of the districts
from one extremity of the State to
the other. With these facilities of ascertaining
the general sentiments, as well athe
opinions of individuals, I mako a so'einn
disclaimer, for mv party as well iif
mrsclf, of any design, purpose, or tvi>h, to
destroy the Union.
Subsequent to IS29, I never made an
address to the people that I d:d not as<cr'
my own devotion to the Union, and novet
did so without a strong cxpressionof sym
paty from mv hearers. It was an exciting
topic, urged by us against the uncon
sfihltional measures of which we com
plained, that they were calculated to weak
en the Union ; and tf enforced, as thereat
oned, by unconstitutional means, might
destroy it? We believed that our doctrines
wore conservative, and I have seen
no reason to chango that opinion. In
short, there was no secret or in lirect pur
pn*o whatever. Every ohjpct was op mi. |
tv avowed, fairly put on record, and boldh
unforced ; so that the public history of
the controversy contains tho whole truth,
ill mutilated and undisguised.
During that controversy, I am not
ware of any communication held with 1
you. I had none. I understood that,
subsequently to the nullification contest,
you had at one time consented to become
the editor of the Southern Review, which,
during tho period of our greatest excite,
rnont, had been suspended. The most
Mrn-'st off >rt made to reestablish it, was
made by a direct trade convention/' in
Charleston, a few years since, composed
f nun of all parties in the South, whose
iSjects were to sustain Southern interMs
and principles, to vindicate and pro.
ert Southern institutions, and tn devcl- j
>po and invigorate Southern literature, t
lever heard or imtgincd any other pur>o*e*
than these,
I have thus, sir. replied to your intermgatories
of a general import, and. in
n conclusion, beg leave to say, that I j
do not regret to have ail occasion of j
muting on record an explicit denial. I
for myself and the gallant ansj patriotic [
men with whom I netod, of this charge ;
if disunion, which has so often, and with !
men liulc truth, been brought against j
us.
I have tho honor to he, very respectful- k
lv, vour obedient servant,
WM. c. rRESTOX.

Extract from Mr. B itler s rrply.
In reply, I will say, I think no p.m. j
plo or paitv has over been more inistin. ,
derstood, or more grossly m:srepresented. j
Those relations, nre now totally changed ;
and, whilst 1 trust that ! could not bo induced
to repeat any tiling to his disadvantage,
which I had heard from hiin during
the existence of those relations. 1 lake j
pleasure in savin* that, in the fullest and j
fiecst conversations with him. for hours ;
and days at a time. I never had cause
even to suspect that lie desired the dissolution
of the Union. On the contrary.
1 well know that he has always regarded
such an event as a great calamity-?one i
of the greatest. I know no man more
deeply impressed with the value of that
Union, and no one whose opinions are so
strong and settled that it never will he
dissolved. I5ut, sir, is it for one moment
to lie supposed that the men who were
most prominent in that controversy, whilst
in nil their speeches and public documents
they professed an ardent devotion to the
Union, were secretly plotting its destruc
tion ?
CONGRESS.
FROM THE NATIONAL INTKLLTORNCER.
Tli E THIRTEENTH AND FOURTEENTH
WEEKS
of the Session of Congress hsve passed
away without any effective progress ha v.
ing been yet made in the great bust less
ofthe Session, except by the discussion
in the Senate of those fundamental principles,
out of which, if at all, a system of
public policy is to be re-erected worthy
of the present consequence and future
destinies of the Republic. iMensures, in.
stead of the principles which lie at their
foundation, would have been introduced,
ind we dare say by this time matured, in
ihc Senate, whose Members appear not to
>e insensible either of the duty or there,
ponsihilily which the exigency of public
iff.nr* devolve* upon them, but that ur.
ier thu Constitution it belongs to ti e
leprcsi-ntative body to origin itr such
Measures, the Senate having only, in re;
?ect to bills " for raising revenue," the
aine power as it possesses in regard to
ippointincnts to office by the President:
hat is, the power of concurrence, with
he additional power, however, of propos.
ing amendments. Upon the measures

he Senate cannot act, otherwise than !>v
the expression of abstract opinion, by
vhich expedient, resorted to on the pre.
-ent eccnsion, it is hoped that some tune
nay be saved which w ould otherwise he
consumed in debate upon tiie House Bills
when they come before it. Hence tl.o
Resolutions propos d by Mr. Clay, and
the Debate which is now going oil upon
them.
The Senate, then, has done all that is
in its power to expedite the public busi.
noss, whilst weeks and months are passing
away and the House of Representatives
has not yet approaohed either of the gnat
inevitable questions of the Revenue and
the Currency, having already occupied
.much time, ineM??.g nearly all of the
last two weeks, in the discussion of questions
of minute proportion, or conseqie.ne.e,
in comparison with those which yet
hang with heavy aspect and no very happy
portent over the remainder of this ses.
sion. Meantiine. as the Secretary of the
Treasuiy has officially informed the House
the exp 'diont of Treasury notes to eke
out a det dent revenue, though the only
one by which, when it was resorted to,
the Government could have been enabled
to keep the wolf from the door for a sin
gle day,* is known to he insufficient for
the immediate wants of the Treasury.
And, worse than nil, the revenue from
imposts being nearly nil pnul into the
Treasury in the new Treasury notes, the
specie received for duties is not sufficient
in amount to pay off the old Treasury
notes (issued twelve months ago to renew
previous) now daily falling due; the consequence
of which is. that the bank at
New York employed by the Treasury to
redeem the Treasury notes, when nrriv.
ing at maturity, out of the proceeds of
the customs, has been obliged, within the
last week, to suffer the Treasury notes to
be protes\edfnrnan payment? The Treasurer
of the Un led Slates, it is said, has
been on a minion to New York, in the
hope 01 making aomo arrangement for
patching over this financial disgrace; but
has not succeeded. What a spectacle is
not this for a gieat agricultural, manufacturing,
and eminently commercial
People to exhibit ? What a disreputable
pre lirainent for it to stand in !
Hut, admitting all this to he true, it
may hi asked, how could the House of
Reoresentat ves have prevented it.' To
I
which we nnswer. Must easily. The 1
Whig Administration had not been :i 1
week in possession of the reins of (tovei n- j
ment, just a year ago, before it was I
discovered that not less than twelve mil. |
lions of dollars of money would he neces. j
snrv to supply the absolute deficiency of
means for meeting trio existing appropria.
J lions for the public service; and. Congress
being convened for the purpose of sup.
I plying this deficiency, a loan to that a.
I mount was recommended by the then !
Secretary of the Treasury, and nuthoriz- j
cd, but upon terms (differing from those,
advised bv the Secretary) which defeated j
its object. Upon the strength of the j
grant of this loan, considering it already
as money in hand. Congress added sev.
eral millions to the existing appropri ilions,
thus enlarging the deficiency which the
-i:-J i?i ?ll i
j loan was to have siipoiien, nnu u uu I'COll |
taken. Soon after Congress came to.
gcthcr at this Session, nearly three
months ago, the Secretary of the Treastirv
verv plainly and explicitly disclosed t>
the Houses, in hisotfieiaI report, the nctiial.state
and prospects of the Treasury.
He told them, in the first pfac\ that there
would he a deficiency in the Treasury on .
the first day of January of more than six
hundred thousand dollars, and for the J
wh??|e year a deficiency of means to the
amount of more than fourteen millions of
dollars; nnd to meet this deficiency here,
commended to Congress to authorize an
cx tension of the term within which the
residue. not vet taken, of the loan already *
authorized shall he redeemable, and the *
re-issue of llio Treasury notes heretofore e
authorized l?y law, amounting to five a

an additional mi.fi of $3,000,000, a (stir,

lo he Mipplied from additional duties
upon foreign articles imported. Of these
recommendations the two first were res.
ponded to by the Committee of Ways and
Means with the promptitude which dis. (
tinguishes the action of that Committtee.
But no part of its report was acted upon
by the House until the clamor of creditors e
literally besieging the doors of the Trea- J
xury induced the House to pass the bi.l [
for a reissue of Treasury notes; whilst the 1
main proposition, the extension of the ^
term ol the loan, upon which, as every
business man will at once see, all the a
operations of the Treasury for this year 1
must essentia ly depend?a proposition so J]
reasonable that not a doubt concerning iT ^
can exist in the mind of any practical '
man?s:ill sleeps quietly upon the table ol *
the House. As lor the third branch of {
the Ways and Me ins, the revision of the
TatiiT, which ought to he completed
in view of all the interests concerned in '
it. as well as that of the Government, r
within sixty days from this date, or at
least before the 30:h of June next, the n
I _ .L_ <1
day on which the dunes tinner me ?
promise Act come down to the lowest
rates, we shall ho agreeably surprised if H
the final action upon it by Congress be cl
completed before the dog days. The e?- c
lablishment ofan adequate revenue from 1
imposts is. however, as we have already j H
had occasion to remark, the one indispen *
able measure, without which neither agri. r
culture, commerce, nor manufactures can '
begin to raise their drooping heads, .?r v
aspire to any thing like the prosperity ?
with which they were blessed before the e
era of exp riments began. For that pros,
perity they are reciprocally dependent on 1
each other; and whatever depresses the ^
one must injuriously affect tho other. "
On this mutual dependence of the three 1
great intepsts, a quotation apt to our "
purpose has just caught our eye, from a
speech delivered in the House of Repre- T
scnlatives a good many years ago [but
which is all the better for its age] by Mr.
Calhoun, the present Senator, from South a
Carolina, upon a motion by Mr. Randolph
to strike out the minimum valuations on
" -? '
cotton goods. ** iMminer ngru;uuuic.
manufactures, nor commerce, taken sep.
nratoly," said Mr. Calhoun, u is the cause w
of wealth; it flows from the three com- '
hi nod, a ill cannot exist without each. The e
s
wealth of any sjnglo nation, or an indivi- j
dual, it is true, may not immediately he
derived from the three ; hut it always pre. n
supposes the existence of the three sources, *
though derived immediately from one or .
9 "% I?
two of them only. Taken in its most en- .
iarged sense, wiiliout commerce industry ^
would have no stimulus; without man?i ^
facturcs. it would be without the moans
of production"; and -without ngncultnrer *
neither of the others can -exist. When
C'
separated " entirely and, permanently, o
thev must perish."
Though certainly very desirous to see
House of Representatives making more ^

Sir?It is with feelings of tha deepest

d one of the most barhorous acts of Indi- ;
in depredations. On Thursday last, at . -j
toon, seven or eight Indiana were discov*
>red in half to three quarter* of a mile of j? %
ny house, making towards a neighboring
iouso. I immediately sent a runner to
ha? house, to apprize them?and through
he neighborhood lor the same purpose;
tut before the news could reach around
i Mr. Richard Tullis' family, about two
niles from me. (he being absent on bttsu
iess.) fell victims to their barbarity, in the
bliowing distressing manner. The lady,
drs. Tullis, was shot dead ; a young lad/
vho was staying there, attempted to run
with Mrs. T.'s infant two weeks old*
nit was run after by an Indian, overta*
.en, knocked down with the limb of *
ree, and stabbed under each arm, (or
leariy so.) to the hollow : she is yet r.live;
l little girl, 8 years old, was shot with an ?
rrow in the back, the barb or spike, ma do if
iron, severing off part of the bone, and
odging under a rib : she died last night ;
i little hoy, six years old, was shot with ., i
in arrow in the back near the Jmmm*, and
nine out near the navel: he i* yet alive; -y^mSpj
he next oldest was killed dead with an
rrow; and the next oldest, a boy, was
hot through the My, and died on Friday
light. All of the children were shot, and v ffjp
he arrows left in them, except the infant, jj
rhich was n??t interrupted. The bouse f
vas stripped, and the Indians made their *

The Legislature has appropriated thq;
