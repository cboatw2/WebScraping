present situation of tkt snawrtry offers bar every e

an unrelenting enemy on bar borders; bar transit- j,
3r exhausted, and her credit almost destroyed, g
ex ts is in a condition to need the support of U
,. other nations, aim) to obtain it upon terms of great o
hardship mid in iuv sacr;tices to herself. If slio n
should receive no couutcnunco aud support from r
the United States, it is not an extrav gmt suppo- "
sition that England may and will reduce her to
all tint dependence of a colony, without taking t]
tipoa herself tho onerous duties and respousibili- n
ties'. of th? uiothor country." U
Whence, unfess from Mexico, is to conic this e
terrible pressure upon Texas, which is to have |i
power to induce a people, nine-tenths of whom h
*, were born in this tree Republic, with all their v
* lore,* not of liberty only, but of republican liber- f
ty, to sacrifice all their enthusiasm for republican b
institutions, and all the cherished recollections of h
rhoir childhood, and to overcome all its forms I? ?
Texas has no quarrel, and is uot like to have, with a
any other Power. What other unrelenting ene- p
tnie* is pressing her upon her borders 1 n
' So far as this Qorern/nrnl is concerned, it has J
fivcry desire to como to the aid of Texas in the v
most prompt and effectual manner. How far we p
shall be supported by the people, I regret to say, b
is somewhat doubtful. g
" Texas has for some time past been in a condi- tl
tion to need the aid and protection of some strong- v
er Power. She ought not to have doubted that ((
the sympathies of this country were altogether c
with iter ; but the want of power in the Govern- c
incut has prevented it from doing anything ctfec- 0
tufl in bur favor." b
If there is really no war, nor any apprehension tl
of any, between Mex;oo and Texas, what is the b
meaning of tho note of the Texan Minister to Mr. tl
Upshur of the 17lh January iast, asking that Ante- E
rican troops may, be sent to Texas to protect her c
against invasion from Mexico 1 The following is h
an extract from that note : a
" I beg leave to suggest that it may bo nppre- sl
bended, should a treaty of annexation b.? conelud- f
ed,?Mexico may think proper at once to tcrmi- u
uato the armistice, break oft ull negotiations for t(
peace, and again threaten or commence hostilities I
against Texas; nud, that some of tho other gov- 9,
crnmeuts who have been instrumental in obtain- <j
ing thfeir session, if they do not tlirow their inilu- i(
enco into the Mexican scale, may altogether with- I
draw their good oHices of mediation, thus losing
to Texas their friendship, and expoaiug her to the a
unrestrained menaces of Mexico, ' n

no war, or that Texaa has confidence in,her ubili- a
ty to maintain that war) I will-make no further \
extracts from this correspondence. It is, howev?f,
full of passages which prove that the strong
inducement held out to Texas to accept the terms
offered to her by our Government, was the pressure
of the war waged by Mexico, and the inability
of Te.tus longer to inaintaiu herself without E
the "aid or protection of some strong I'owor." If,
then, a state of war actually exists, do we not by
annexing Texas adopt that war and make it our
own? The conclusive answer to this question is, ^
that Texas would then have no power to conclude
a treaty for the termination of that war; our
Government could alone do it. It is therefore
our own war, and a war in which wo should be
involved by the action of Congress, as prescribed J?
by the Constitution, but by the President and
Senate alone. To say that this is a treaty, and
that the President mi l Senate constitute the treaty-making
jwwer, is mere quibbling and paltering
with the true nieauing of the Constitution, the
'' provision of which wus designed to prevent this n
^ -.r ?a ?? ;?....?^ _j ^
reign jwwers of the Government Iroin being ex- 8|
ercised without tire concurrence of all the departments
with which that jwwer was deposited. To tj
involve the country in a war without such concurrent
action, is a perversion of, and a fraud upon
the Constitution. :j
I will not discuss the question whether the an- ^
nexition of Texas without the consent of Mexico
would be a violation of our obligations to t'.iat Go- ^
verninent. I think it would. To recoarniso a
revolted department of another Government n
is one thing; to appropriate it to ourselves
is another and a very different thing. It results c
from necessity, that as to foreign Governments, c
the party in possession of actuul power shall be y
recognised. Foreign nations are not to wait an t
indefinite time for the re-conquest or subjection of ^
u revolted province or a counter revolution, und (
suffer during all the time a ruinous suspension of |
their commerce; and hence the rule to look only (,
to the actual possession of power. But the ques- (
tion is u very different one as to any idtorfercncc ^
in the contest, and stilt more when it is proposed ^
to put an end to that contest by the very sliorlliai.d
provess of appropriating to ourselves tlie sub- '
jdcl of it. But this point has been so fully discuss- r
vd that I shall here leave it.
But even if we had the strict right, I would not j
exorcise that right under all the circumstances of j
the case. Our course, in the opinion of the world, t
(f think an erroneous opinion,7-hw nor U6off altogether
neutral and fair towards Mexico in relation |
to this Texan revolution. I desire to see the con
duct of our Government not only upright and just,
but that it should also bo bdyoud the reach even
of imputation, and more especially when dealing
with weaker powers. It is not to be doubled that
in this matter the undivided opinion of the world* a
would be against us. Such will be the universal t
feeling in Mexico. I do not doubt that it will not t
l*j forgotten or forgiven by the Mexican people. I t
would Ifot, if I could avoid it givo ofTencc to that c
people. Mexico is our neighbor. She is the most (
powerful, ofJtho Spanish American Kepublics.? t
< VfiWliqUtof liberty which wo flral kindled on. fj
this continent, anil our free institution!, are to ex- t
tend to our Southern neighbors, they must pass t
tiirougn iuexico. one is, indeed, the first horn of I
our Revolution. She was the first of the Spanish I;
provinces to throw oft* the yoke of Spain, and to a
establish institutions of which ours was the model, r
and her struggle to do this was full of instances of s
noble .constancy and heroic virtue. The names of r
Hidalgo and Morrelos, of Gomez Farias and Uus- c
tainenle are entitled to rank, with our own Han- f
cocks and Adamses. Considering that Mexico t
was oppressed hy colonial vassalage for three huti- li
drod years, and has since been subjected to the not tl
less demoralizing influence of a constant succession c
of revolutions, hnr progress nnd advances huve y
Jjuon nothing short of miraculous. Every consid- I
oration should urge us to lead them on "with the (
kind hand of assiduous care" in the great career Ii
which we have run before them, and have iuspir- t
cd them with the spirit to pursue. Although to c
so uc extent exasperated against us on account of n
the Texan war, the general feeling toward us is a
not unkind. Their odinirotien of our institutions s
is universal, and even extreme, as many of their v
statesmen desire to establish (he same in Mexico, r
without adverting to the very difleroiitcircuinstan- d
cc? of the two countries. Let us not, then, con- o
vert these feelings of admiration and kindness into e
hitter hostility and a deep sense of wrong and in- I
suit. Let us not make enemies of those who wish S
to be our friends. If the higher considerations of a
.philanthropy and duty are to have no influence, n
there are other reasons of jio'iry and interest which e
should not bo disregarded. It it is true that the 1
monarchies of thu old world really look with jeal- o

j interfere in any way in the affairs of this conlient,
is it not important for us to conciliate the
ood will of our neighboring Republics, and thus
? place ourselvos aC the head of the Government
f this continent I This-you may be assured, is
ot to be accomplished by acts of even seeming
opacity and violence, not by threats and insult,
but by kind words and the linking of the arm. 1
Perhaps 1 may be influenced in some degree in
hese feeling by a grateful sense of the many kindessfcs'Whicn
1 received during my residence in
loxico ; it tn?y be so, and I should not be ashamd
to acknowledge it. From the moment when 1

jpero in too streets to the President, seemed to
ie with each other in acts of kindness to me.? 1
'resident Santa Anna hus so often made me happy
y making me the instrument of making others ,

ubHouui iii i?mriug testimony to his many noble ;
nd generous qualities. It would be with great 1
ain thjit iu auy war I would draw my sword
gainst Moxicn. Iu such a war as this I could nou
lut would Mexico declare war. Perhups she ?
rou'd not. I do not think she would without the (
romise of aid. If she did not, it would only be
ecausc she was too wcuk. This to a proud and 1
onerous American heart, would bo worse oveu '
ian war; that we had wronged a weak Power, i
>'hich was too feeble to defend her rights. But it
light be thut other and stronger Powers might '
onic to the aid of Mexico. There are some indi- ?
ntious of this, and it certainly would be so, if soinc ]
f strong powers of the world are so fatally |
ent oo our destruction as it is said they ore. But ,
lero ure certain valiant spirits, with whom it would '
c the strongest argument in favor of the measure, '
tat it would involve us in a war with Mexico, !
England and Fruuce. I have had some experi- .
nco in my time of these crocodile caters, and I j
avc not found them, in the moment of real danger,
ny braver than other people. It would be very 1
tupid and un-American to doubt, that England,
'ranee and Mexico united would bo no match for
s whatever; ami still more slupidjutd imprudent '
> express such a doubt. But, for my single self, 1
must confess thut I would prefer entering into i
uch a conflict with a lit-in conviction that '*the
uttrrel was jifst," and as a mere matter of convcnjnee,
I would like to have our own people united,
t would make tho victory somewhat easier.

>ESTRUCTION OF TIIE BRANCH MINT
BY FIRE.
It is our melancholy duty to haye to announce 1

lorning last. The Hre, when fir|? discovered,
ras seen to proceed from the upper story flfthe 1
western wing in tlie room where ihcclotmtot

om some of the workmen, no fire had been for
t least ten days before the accident; and we
jurn from some of those first at the fire that noling
but about 8 feet of the floor had been burnt
nd hud water been handy it might have boon rally
extinguished, but the air being admitted the
Ionics rapidly spread so that all chance for its
irangc to us was, that as there were reservoirs
o effort was used ns far as we could see to use
ic water that they contained, and the upper part
f the building seemed entirely resigned to the
icrcy of the flames; and it does seem to us that
' tlie attention of the people had been directed
y some of the workmen early to the reservoir
early above the fire, a different result might have

vould not set any thing on fire. There is one ,

me in the community so lost to every feeling of
lonor as to dosire its destruction, they had every 1
ipportuuity, if they could gain admittance, of ,
mrrving their meanness into execution. Mr.
'aidWeft, the Superintendent, was sick in Lincoln
bounty, tiiid he hod left it in charge with another
icrson, who was to sleep in the building while lie

RUINS OF TEMPLES IN TEXAS.
The Telegraph (Texas,) has been informed by
i gentleman who has traversed a large portion of
he Indian country in Northern Texas, thu courtry
lying between Santa Fe and the Pacific, and
here are vestiges of ancient cities and ruin d
lastlcs or temples on the Rio Puerco and on the
Colorado of the west. He says, that on one of
liu branches of the Rio Puerco, a few days travel
i-oiuSanta Fe, there, is an immense pile of ruins
lmt appears to belong to an ancient uJTnpYe. ions
of the walls are still standing, consisting of
imestone regulurly hewn and laid in cement. The ,
milding occupies an extent of more than an
ere. It is two or thrco stories high, hus no
oof, but contain* many rooms, generally of a
quare form, without windows, and tlio lower i
owns are so durk and gloomy that they resemble <
avuens rather than apartments of an edifice built ,
or human habitation. Our informant wus unable |
o describe the style of architecture, but he bcieves
it could not be erected bv thnSnanianb <>? <
? ?- I ?t
lie stones arc much worn by tlio rains, and null- <
ute that the building lias stood several hundred
'cars. From this description we are induced to ]
teiieve that it resembles the ruins of Palenque or
Prelum. Ho says that there are many sirniir
ruins on the Colorado of the West, which einp- '
ich who me t^nnioriiiu sea. In one of the vallies
if the Cordilleras traversed by that river, and i
,l>out four hundred miles from its mouth, there is
lufge terngle standing, its walls and spires preenting
scarcely any trace of dilapidation; and
vere it not for want of a roof, it might still bo '
L'ndered hubitable. Near it, scattered along the
celivity of a mountain, ore the ruins of what has i
nco been a large accjiduct, part of which howovr,
is in the solid rock still visible. Neither the
udians residing in the vicinity, nor the oldest
punish settlers of the nearest settlements can give
ny account of the origin of these buildings. They i
icrely know that they huve stood there from the ?
nrliest periods to which their traditions extend. {

. ~ TEMPERANCE CONTENTION. >-<*>
On Woduesday and Thursday last, the Static
Tomporanoa Society Hold their Convention jp this * *
village. It consistedbf Delegates from- twenty
Districts of the State, some ot which were eery "
largely represented. After organising in the Baptist
Church, they took possession of an arbor phe? '
pared for their reception by a Committee of the,
Mechanic's Washiagtonian Society of this village,
in a handsome manner, and which, during fketr .'
session, was well attendod by the inhabitant* of1
the village, and the surrounding country. The
Convention consisted of upwards of one hundred
members, all "good and true" soldiers in the colu
water army. The business of the Convention
was transacted in a very able manner, showing
that those who took part in its discussion, were
well acquainted with the "waxings" and "warnings"
of the great cause, 'and had come forward
fully prepared to assist their fellow-hbbrers, in .
preparing tbe means to bring about a thorough re- A
volution between mankind and king Aieohol, his aider*
and abettor*. - Wo were much pleased
with -tbe addresses delivered by the Hon. J. J).
O'Neil, Col. McWillie, Rev. Mr. Turner, Rev. ^
Mr. " DuWe, and HlK Uarliiigtoii, aH of which
was much to the purpose. The discussion upon
the subject of' Legislation was of a very interesting
nature, and upon the whole, elicited some
very able speeches, in support of the good old
way, "moral suasion," which, os heretofore, appeared
to be the grout bulwark upon which a majority
of tlie friends of llio cause depundod, but
M "(llW-fdM will iliiQAMtu ' llin?
_ Mibiw na? VBIIUU9
wivi suggested to get at "moral suasion."
Wo feel confident, that the Convention ha*
done much for this immediate neighborhood ?i*
ready, its it has closed a breach among the members
of the cause here, who were undetermined
upon the best mode of proceeding to insure tho
success of this great benevolent undertaking, they
having adopted an address which cannot fail to jtk
satisfy the most sceptical, that all the means intended
to l?e adopted by the cold Water army,
either individually or collectively, ore for the geuorsl
good of mankind. Xlw Delegates of this,
and in fact all such Conventions, deserve well of
their country, leaving their homes and business,
without fee or reward, to lay plans to save thd
rising generation front the ?nuro? luki by the tyrant
king Alcohol. We. feel welt satisfied, that should .
these Conventions las continued hut quarterly or
semi-annually, throughout the State, that ere five ^
years elapses, our beloved country will be relier* - ' %
ed frotn this fell destroyer, and it will be a rare <|b
occurrence to see one of our inhabitants, by means
of the intoxicating draught, degraded below the
brute creation.
Too much praise cannot be given to the oflfieers
of the Convention, for the able manner in which
the business was conducted, and the promptness,
decision, "and gentlemanly department, of the President
of the State Temperance Society, whilst
presiding over the Convention, will be long remembered
by its members, and those who attended
through the whole sessioir i*>
