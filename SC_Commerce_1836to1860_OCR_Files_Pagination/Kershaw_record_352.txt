SATURDAY MORNING, MARCH 21.1810
Temperance Meeting.
A meeting of tie Kerehaw District Tcmporanco
Society will bo hold at the Presbyterian Church, in
thia town, oo TUESDAY EVENING next. The
friends of Temperance, and the public generally, are
respectfully invited to attend. The meeting will be
addressed by the Hon. Joh.v Belton 0'Nea.ll. )
- I
(
JET vVo bag Ioavo to call the attsntion of onr adver-1
tising friends, to the following article, in the term* of
our pip;r, viz:?"Accountsfor advertising and job
-'~work, will be presented for payment quarterly," Wc
do this, as tho first quarter his expired, and we expect
shortly, to discharge our portion of tho terms, by
presenting the accounts," and wc trust our friends
will bo equally prompt in discharging theirs, by making
"payment." Wo would also remind our subecribers
generally, of another article in our terms,
viz: thit the Journal is published "at three dollars in
advanc s three dollars and fifty cents in eix months,
or four dollars at the eipiration of tho year." Fay
menta made any time previous to tho first of April, I
will be coasidored in advance, but aftor that time tho!
increased rate will bo added, in every instanco.?
There &ro a number, we doubt not, who would prefer
paying three dollars now, to paying three and a half
or four at the end of the year, and wo trust they will
avail themselves of the opportunity wo now offer.
J7*\Ve are indebted to the Hon. J. C. C.\T.nor.v, as
also to the Hon. T. D. Sumtch, our immediate Representative
for various public documents.
THE TAX ACT AND THE BANKS.
The subject of the late Taw Act, and its probablo
effects upon the Binhs and tho People, has heretofore
attractod a largo share of public attention, and
is IU10I7, wc think, still to command it. It will be
remembered that the Legislature enacted that the
Taxes should be paid "in specie, paper medium or
the notes of the specio paying Banks of this State."
At the time this enactment was made, only the fol?
lowing Eti.hs wero paying specie, and up to this pc. j
^ riod, there are none other, viz: The Bank of the State,!
^ the D ink of Charleston, the Commercial Bank, the!
Bank of Georgetown, the Bank of Camden, and the
Merchant's Bank, Chorcw. As the circulation of
tho notes of the Banka in the city, which pay specie,
is very limited, it i? probablo that more than three
fourths of the tajrs will be paid in the notes of the
CCUairj oamis. A.ivsu uuii-s nui vi vvu.oi> jjU Lu:av
diatcly into the Bank of the State, which is practically
the Stuto Treasury. The important question thon
arises, what will the Bink do with thorn? Will it
pay them out again to tho creditors of tho State??
Or, will specie be demanded for them? We scarcely
know how to credit the assertion, but we havo heard
it stated that tho Bank of the State will adopt the !
latter course. If ouch be the fact, and from the man- j
uer in which it comos to us, we hardly have room to j
doubt, we cannot but think that the President and
Directors havo widely mistaken the object of the Legislaturc,
in tho enactment to which we havo referred.
Taat body certainly never contemplated that
they wero creating r.n engino to cripplo and break
down the action of the specie paying banks. On tho
c ir.trary, we had always supposed that the Legislature
by this measure intended to compliment and encourage
those Banks that were using every effort to
fulfil their obligations, rather than oppress and punish
them.
If the creditors of the State demanded specie for 1
their claims, tho case would be widely different, ar.d !
there would be just grounds for the contemplated ac-'
tlon, but we have no intimation that such a contingency
is anticipated.
*. The whole taxes of the State amount to something
over two hundred and eighty thonsand dollars. If!
eighty thousand of this amount is collected in the
notes of tho Dank of the State and tho Dank of!
Charleston (and we question if half that sum is paid j
in those cotes) it will leave two hundred thousand to j
be paid in the notes of the interior Banks. Now,
what will bo the effect of the withdrawal, at once,
from these Banks, this enormous amount of specie?
The necessary, inevitable and immediate result will
be that these Banks must, in the same proportion,
curtail their circulation, by refusing farther accora- J
modations, &, enforcing with an unsparing hand, pay.;
znent from their d.btors; the first law of nature, self-!
preservation, will compel them, painful and unpleasant
as it must be, to pumuc this course. Diffused
over such a largo space of country as tho debtors of
the interior Banks arc, and divided as the loans are,
among such a vast number of individuals, chiefly
planters and farmers, a pressure and panic may bo
expected under such a course, so far aa this State is
. concerned, which will throw that created by the
removal of the deposites, spccro circular and all,'
by Gon. Jackson, far into the back ground.
If the State creditors do not demand specie for
their claims, we can look upon its demand by the
State from those Banks which are trying in these
W times of embarrassment and pressure, to discharge
L. their obligations to the public in no Other light than a
speculation cn the distresses of ?or people. We sincerely
trust, however, that better counsels will prevail,
and that the course we have heard suggested,
will not be adopted, and that the Back of tho Statu
will not require from tho othor Banks any other pay^
nent for tho notes which may be received for Taxes,
than such as will amply satisfy the public creditors.
W This much it is, most assuredly, its duty to do, ana
moro is not required. We can see no adequate reason,
at this particular juncture, for tho measure pro.
posed, and coming from the eourco it does, at a time
of such unprecedented embarrassment, it cannot fail
men iiic uu^uduuea conaomnauon 01 a. jargu majority
of those who have a right to speak and to be j
heard on the 6ubjrct.
Not only is the wholo commerce of the country
oppressed and deranged, and] every man connect,
cd with commercial pursuits, compelled to] 6train
every nerve, and make sacrifices to meet his engagements,
but the pressure is folt by the planter and the
fanner, in consequence of tho depreciated prices of
the products ofthc soil. Is it wise? Is it just? Does
the circumstances of tho State require that thu additional
step should be taken to add to the distresses
of a community already sufficiently harrassod?
We piahe there rtmarka not because wo Uava any;
\
partlcuia: sympathy ib; th& Bmks, fir it has bfeon
said that they are " heartless'' and " soulless"?oi
coarse they cannot feci; but in preserving themselves
it may becorao necessary for thom to adopt a reBtric.
tivo policy so severe as even to be painful to a corporation
which has neither a heart or a soul.
Wo doubt not, but if the plan, uncalled for as wo
believe it is, be definitively adopted, the interior banks
will bo proparedfor the result, and meet the demand,
but the people, the ultimate sufferers, will hold the
advisers and the actora in this speculation to a strict
account, at the proper tribunal, for the distress and
embarrassment thus unnecessarily forced upon thom.
PrsriMAXsmp.?We were much gratified a day or j
two since, by a visit to Mr. A. G. Powers' Writing i
Academy, at Mr. Gilford's Hail. He has some rare
and exquisite specimens of penmanship which speak
plainly his ability to exec ate in tho most masterly
manner; and the exhibitions of improvement by his
pupils prove that he has the faculty of imparting
this ability to others. We recommend our friends,
and especially some who write for the nowapapors,
to patronise Mr. Powers. They will thus attain an
elegant accomplishment, and save the printers a deal
of trouble in decyphering their hieroglyphics.
More Robberies.?Since our last, tho rogues have
been busy in their vocation. On Sunday night the
Drug Store of Mr. Jaue3 R. M'Kain was broken
open, ahd thoroughly searched with the expectation
of finding money, but nono had been left in the
house, and tho villains were disappointed. Nothing
waa taken that can be missed. On Monday night a
moro successful demonstration was mado on the premises
of our old friend Capt. Meooy. His store
was robbed of about eighty or a hundred dollars in
cash. The Captain thinks that the rogue must have
secreted himself in the housQ, in the evening previ-1
ous to closing tho store for the night, for tho purpose
of effecting his objoct. Our citizons, as they ought to
bo, aro on tho alert, and although we aro not aware
that there i3 any good ground for suspecting any individual
in particular, yet thero has been some little
a! * *L. 1 ^ at. _ T ? a
commoi-oa m la? ranis 01 iae ivajerj, iuu many vi
whom are permitted to make a lodgement in our com.
muaity. Proceedings have beon oommenccd against
some of the fratomity as vagrants, and one, Mr.
John* H. Dabxcy, who hails from the District of
Columbia, has been convicted, and furnished with
comfortable quarters. We trust the process will be
continued until our town shall be thoroughly purged
of every vest'ge of loaftrism.
CONGRESS.
The first effort towards the transaction
of any business in the House of Representatives
has at last been made. The Democratic
members from New Jersey have
Been permitted to take their seats, by a very
decided vote, and ihe Independent Treasury
Bill, which has been lying on the table,
ever since it came from the Senate,
has been referred to the Committee of
^Vays and 3Ieans. That Committee will
not be long, we presume, in making its report,
when we may expect a most animated
and excited discussion. There will be
no difficulty however, since the admission
of the New Jersey members, in the administration's
carrying all its measures.
THE RIGHT OF PETITION.
The question of the right'of petition has
been agitated in Congress for the last two
years with great zeal by the abolition fanatics.
Decausc the Constitution guarantees
to the people the right "peaceably to
assemble and petition the government for
a redress of Grievances," these incendiaries
take it for granted that Congress
is bound to treat every thing in the shape
ot a petition with great deference, aud
attention. In the House of Representatives,
however, the proper course has
been adopted, that of not receiving the
petitions at all, and now the Senate is
made the arena for the presentation and
discussion of these fire brands. Our attention
has been attracted to this subject,
by the remaiks of Mr. Calhoun on the
presentation of an abolition petition by
Mr. Clay. His picture of the course of
the abolitionists which we give below is
true to the life. They must be resisted
at the threshold; nothing must be yielded,
for every concession, but adds fierceness
to their fanaticism. Mr. Calhoun says:
"It is proper to speak out. If this
question is left to itself, unresisted by us, it
cannot but terminate fatally to us. Our
safety and honor are in the opposite direction?to
take the highest ground, and maintain
it resolutely. The North will always
take position below us, be ours high or low.
Tiicy will yield all that wc will and sometiling
more. If we go for rejection, they
will atfirst insist on receiving, on the ground
of respect for petition. If we yield that
point and receive petitions, they will go
for reference, on the ground thai it is ao- <
surd to receive and not to act, as it truly
is. If we go for that, they will next insist
on reporting and discussing; and, if that,
the nest step will be ^tomake conccs sion?
to yield the point of abolition in this District;
and so on, till the whole process is
consummated, each succeeding step proving
more easy than its predecessor."
