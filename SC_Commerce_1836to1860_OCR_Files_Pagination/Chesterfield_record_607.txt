-.The reduction of postage upon letters t
is a subject which has engaged the pub.
Ire attention for years, and is one of great c
interest to the whole community. | i
it is contended by many, whose opin. j ?
ions are entitled to respectful considcra. j t
(ion, that the reduction of postage would t
give an increase of revenue. Without a
undertaking to discuss tins question at r
, present, I am not prepared, from the pre- ' i
acnt financial condition of the Dejiart- j r
- n . t_ _ i /
ment, to recommend a reduction 01 me , v
rate* of postage, as now figed by law, but j c
invite a modification of tbegi so far as to r
make them conform more generally to the i r
smaller coin of the Uuited Urates, and j t
solicit a revision of the law* regulating , t
the postage on newspapers. I dw not de- j si
aire that the rates of postage on newapa- i
per* pro|?er should be igcreawd. though r
much might he saved to the IJepartinent (
if the principle of pre postage w as applied . j
to newspapers, provided such regulation h
was deemed acceptable to public opinion.
I must, however, earnestly invite your j
attention and hojie you wiH call that of

I resjiecifully submit, to the President, the
impriaty nl c?uii!i(!u<cat|ng to Congress the
news which 1 entertain and nave been exiretSfd
U|Hin tins subject.
Some embarrassments to the free transit of
he United States mail coaches over that p ?rf
?f tlie Cumberland R??ad which Iit;?? witlim the j
imits of the State of Virginia haw been exjerieuceil
during ihe present year, inr.'d^nt to
t right assumed by the au'liorilie* of that
S ate to impose a lax tijioii the coach transporting
the mail.
In the act of Congress proposing a cession (
pf all right which the United States claimed
aver said road, upon certain conditions, to the '
States through which it passed, it was ex- I
pressjy provided that no toll upon the ?tage
roaches, d'c. conveying the United States
nail should be imposed. With this, among
itiier reservations and exceptions, the S-lies i
)f Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Ohio, accep. j
:ed the cession, and assumed ihe control over
to rruicii of tin road .16 is within their respeclive
territories.
Jit appeais that, hv a subsequent, art of the
Virginia Legislature, so much of the act, bv
which *die accepted the road, exempting the
huge, coach, &.C. conveying ihe United Stales
nail from the payment of toils, was repealed,
i lax was authorized to be, and was. imposed
jpon the same. Without detaining you with
i ?urih?r narrative upon this subject. I submit
he letters and correspondence of the Depart. J
Mi-lit in relation thereto, and th? documents
iccoumaiiymg i he same. Though the amount i
:harg.d and exacted at the siugie gate in Vir. I
tjuiia i inconsiderable, yet, il she have the i
right to impose the toll, the other States have ,
in equal right, and will, most unquestionably,.
as*err it: and thus an additional annual burden
>f near will he added to the transpnr. '
taijou dt the United Stales mad over ma:
road, which is already the most expensive
mail coach service in liie United States.
It is proper thai 1 should mtorin yuu that
the prosecution instituted against the agent
t?l Virginia, before I was called to the di*rharg'-of
the duties of this Denartinent, for
instructing the passage of the dieted States \
nail on said road, by closing the toll gate ar.iinn
the Irec passage of the coach convey,
ng ttie mad. hao, upon my suggest uui, lieeit
suspended for the present, uudei a nope that
jjMin a full rcprnamotion of ttiis subject, by
ite progcr au hoii'v, to the State of Virgsni.1. (
ill cause of difficulty might be removed, with>ui
the necessity of a penal prosecution.
I submit for your information, the report of
he chief cleric of the Po?t office Department,
n reference to the expenditure of the appro- |
jriation made at the extra session ol Congroe*, I

We return our thanks to the Hon. John
Campbell for a copy of the Presidents Message
md accompanying documents.
\
Much room is occupied in our columns this
veek with public documents. Although we
:annot insert all of even the most important
locumenla issuing from the different departnenlsofboih
the Federal and State govern i
nor.ts, there are some which ir is desirable j
iiftt every reader of any ticwspapej; should j
tee. Of this character are the docuuu nis lo j
vhieh we now give place. The able report
?f Col. Allhiou ??n llje Virginia and Now Vurk
jontroverey will he read with interest by all
vho have not hitherto seen it. Its temperate
one and its courtesy towards a sister slate,
ire worthy of commendation, at a time when
t is so much the fashion among southern
itatesmen and poiliticians to indulge theiiileives
in ranting abuse and puerile gasconade j
vhenever the relation of the southern and j
lorlliorn states on tiie subject of slavery is the |
opic of discussion. The violence ofsouthern
xiiiticiaus has done more to prejudice the
nt? rests of the slavoholding states, at the^
iorth than all that abolitionists have d>?ne or
:a?i do. The world have an impre.ssii n that
nen who exhibit in their controversies a frettil
irritability are not those who most feel their
wn strength or who are most in earnest lor
action whether offensive or defensive.
Wu have.no later accounts from Washington
than to the 20lh. owing tocontinued
failures of the mail. The plan of
Fiscal Agency for which the President
*
invited Congress to call upon the Seere.
fary of the Treasury had not heoii rcpor
ted. It was understood in the city that
the subject was still under consideration
by the Cabinet. It is not improbabl*
that the delay is caused by the suggestion
of modifications in the plan or Ms
details by members of (Congress after
their arrival in Washington
Id Congress tiiey nrc doing nothing of
interest, in the House a debate hid
heeii going on for some days and was
likely to last several days longer, on the
|.test ion of refering tiiat pari of the President's
Message relating to the Turitf.?
Tue friends of a protecting t.irifl' wished
(o refer it to the Committee ;ou ManuliieKites,
and those opposed to (lie protection
of Manufactures, to the Committee of
Way s and Means. None wished to violate
the "compromise." Hut some wish,
en, within its limits, to discriminate in fa.
vor 'of the manufacturing interest of the
ountrv. This was opposed hv others
who insisted that 'oilgross should look
only to the amount of revenue to he raised,
and not lotiie effect of iin|H>sts upon any
interest of the country.
A correspondent of the 0.1 Itimorc Patriot
suggests to Congress the passng of a I aw pro
viduig that if any of the states r?:fnsc to
receive their share of the proceeds of the public
lauds, such share or shares be added to
tin- general fniid for distribution among the
ruber stales. We hope Congress will not be
hi haste to pass such law; or at least, that
it will not be made to operate retrospectively*
For we learn from different sources entitled
to credit that while the Legislature of South
Carolina was passing a bill and resolutions to
proliihit the Slate from receiving its snare ol
1 ho money, there was, at the same time, an
understanding among the members that if the
< i!it*r states should receive their respective
' rv~' ?u
snares, ccuui v>ori'iiiio nuumi >u mn i.n-?,
take hers also, and risque the subsidising influence
of the " bribe." We trust CoH^rc-f
f *
will pass no ex post fqr.to law on the subject.
The grand jury of the county of Philadelphia
have presented Nicholas Piddle,
Samuel Jaudon and others, for entering
into a conspiracy to defraud the stockholder*
of the U. S. Bank, of the several
sunw of $400,000 #300,000 and $130,000.
It i.v an easy matter in times ol
great excitement ngainst any set of men
to get up a preson'mrnt against them.?
Sustaining the charges on trial is a
liilFrcnt thing, and may or inav nol
l>c done in the present-instance. There
t:an he no doubt that the If. S. Bank
after it became a State Bank, was mosl
wretchedly managed. Whether tin
management was fraudulent, or onlv un<
I w
wise, will, perhaps, be now tested.

The rales at the Board were to a large ex. ^

The Governor ofludiana. in his mes- *
sage to the Legislature puts down the
public debt of the state at $15,088,146'. '
Of this amount the sum of 8*2.684,000 ' j
was borrowed to constitute the capital of j j
a state Bank, and to put the hank into op- j
ernfion; the sum of $1,300,000 is in Tren. ,
?urv notes issued bv the stHte, hearing I
interest; and the remainder consists of j i
stote bonds sold for tho purpose r.f getting i
money to carry on works of Internal Im-1
provoment. The interest payable annu" |
| ally is $ 16*2,44*2. The expeliscs of pay- j
I ing this interest where it is due and i
j payable, in eirhantfc, commissions &o.,
are estimated at $132,560, or nbout ttrc/i-'
ly ic^/i and a half per cent ; which i
raises the whole amount payable by the
J state oh account of the interest of her
j debt, lp $014,000. To meet this interj
est account the only means of the state
j "which may he relied on wilh certainty"
says the Governor, arc:
1st. The interest on the procerds
of sales of the Wabash
and Erie canal $24,0001
2d. Interest from the surplus
revenue 32,000
50,000
being little more than one eleventh of the
whole. An annual interest demand n- j
gainst the state of $615,000, wilh nn i
income of only $56,000 to meet it, and !
I the principal altogether unprovided for ! |
The Treasury note* of tl?o state nre re. I
, ceivnhlc f??r taxes, nnd most if not all the j
taxes for the present year and for some i
time to come will be paid in that medium; i
so that no aid lor some years is expected !
from that source in paying the interest I
of the public debt ; while none of the I
public works arc so far advanced as to}
yield a cent of revenue, except the Wahash
and Krie canal mentioned above.
"Such," says the Governor **is actually
| our condition ; and candor and justice to
1 ourselves and our creditors require us to
11 acknowledge that wc have neither under
': our control nor in prospect, for some time
! to come, the means to discharge the inter.
? est on the whole of our public debt,"
The Governor, however, does not pro.
; | po??o i*tl;c suicidal measure of repudiating
the public debt." lie. is of opinion that
the abundant natural resources of the;

.J make out a more plausible pretext lor
! repudiating the debts, or at least a part 1
1 J of them, than Gov. McNutt, of Mississip. J
' j pi bus been able to inukc out. For the
