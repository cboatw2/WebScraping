5an. EDITOR,
%% e see n your paper remarks on ouT
Red Ilill niee!'ng, and it appears to be
strange to you that we mention the Consti
tution so often and so groundless; we say
in our Resolttions that we believe the ex
tra session to be unconstitutional, and we
further say unwise and impolitic; the two
lasi words you appear not to contend for,
and we believe ithe course pursued by the
legislature to be unprecedented and'also un
constitutional, and we believe so yet; we
also believe the U. Slates bank to be un
constitutional, and we are independent sub
treasury men with the specie circular up to
the huh. Do you think shat will make the
Chief Justice blush? and in the Resolution
(which is the last) otiered by Mr. Davis,
we say if the course pursued by our legisla
ture is agreeable to the Constitution we
want it altered so as the farmers may come
in. You say we have ofTered no proof to
our assertions; we say we believe them to
be as they are stated, and you in the posi
tive say, they are not on, and where isyour
proof; you quote the Executive and Chief
Justice and what proof is that, or is the
Executivo to be the mandate of the State;
the Chief Justice is to decide on laws after
they are made and the iaw in test before
hint; you appear to make a strange case of
it beenuse we do not understand the Con
stitution, do you remember the law the Le
gislature past on the opt of -.iiegiance
when the Executive and a majority of the
Legislature pronounced it Constitutional,
and now you think it strange that a parcel
rf poor Farmers don't understand it. Did
the Judge pass sentence before the law w;
ptassed or afterwards? but if that law had
been presoted by as incompetent a writer
as the members of the Red Hill meeting
lie se'ntenice would lhave been what you
ive passedl on the Red liill Resolutions;
3r has the Judge any thing to do with the
extent of the power of the Executive. Youz
ire very much surprisedl that we should
think- the Executive had not a right to call
the Legislature. We want you to exam
isne the Resolution asnd see if you can see
any ssuch indlicasion; we acknowledge we
aire igniorant, but we by chance have heard
if the Consutitution. WVe never denied the
Constitsutional right of the Executive to call
ste Legislature, buit who I.s to jsudge thme
extent of that call, the E xective, Judge, or
Legisseture. The Executive may on ex
rraordiniary occasions convene the Legisla
lure. hlow is the Executive to he the jud;;e
if that call; what power is the Executive
elothecd wish; is it wvith the private concertns
>f thie citizens of the State? or is he clothed
with she laws of the State, well then if he is
elothed with the laws of the State, is any
if those laws violated or is the Slate thrown
in a perilous condition for the wvant of a
law, or is the State disordered ina any wvay
for the w"ant of extra sessions.
Suippose wh~en the Legislature met atnd
received the message you did. which we
'ontend was private cnlamities which was
lie part of Cha~deston nowv lying in ruins,
now had the State any tmore control over
that part of Charleston than it had over any
man's planting interest? If two thirds of
that Body hasd said that thec call was such a
sine as the Constituitioni intensded, would the
hIdscge lhave to decide? As to fires in cities
end towns is ats common as atiy thing we
myec .amongst us according to its nature,
nsd did you ever knuow the Logislatuiro
alled before, and now show to the meeting
he clat.ae in the Constittution to warrant
'our courase, to pledge the faith of the tate
>inditng posti~rity for twesnty and thirty
rears so btuild hoL'ses for private individuals
or their owno priiv.ate suses, or point out a
lause to thle meeting that wvill come tinder
lie clause in ste Consisation to call the
egiislnture together for privase uses. We
vill now come dowvn to the Iav as it etands,
las the Chiief Justico any thing to do witht
t unless the law was in test; we will cite
you to the 9tht Artice. 2d Clasuse of the
Constitution. anid see howv it agrees with
he law yout have made; as to thme ground
roan have taken on internal improvemelnt
l as no bearing on the subject of the meet
ing for we contend that the build0
Charleston rind the Rail Road is as diet I 1
from internal improvement as for a fa
to improve hi s lantution; for the public can
not derive any profit directly, and we da,
tend that it is as much loss for a farmetk
lose his planting interest to the publidf
wastie burning of Charlestoni necoriling-Je
the extent of the loss; or what profit dirice,
ly will thn public receive from the Rail rid
and now the faith and credit of the
pledged for t wo millions of dollar4 with tld&l
company for their own private use, is thi
common in this Stare or any other;.t
naintain the ground that we maintainiedjiq
our Resolutions: we are as much sirprisil
nt your remarks as you appear to he at*&ir
Resonlutions; we want you to exanine,ain
Resolbtions and you will find that we gi.e
our helief; we tielieving n thing to ho e
does tint mik s it so, and you content] yo6
course to lie CotstitutionIal, and you have
not produced a single Article inl the Consti
tultion to prove your course, now all that the
tneetin want. you to do is to poii.t out-the
Article in the- Constitution that will prove
your course, and the meetini will he satis
fied, for ihe Resolutions wias offered in good
feeling and not a motive of our Legislatroe
or Execuative inp'elached, but have pved
reason to belive that their motives watt
s;ood, but the whole transaction appears to
lie so fsr from what we believe to be in the
spit it of the Constitution. we wnnt tile inat
ter explained, and that will be what was
the intentiou of the meetini!.

and the Surrogate at her request appointed
Ju4tice loodkood as her guardian. Mr.
liloodgood then placed her to board at the
house of Mr. Warren, sit the corner of
Houston and Crosby streets. Here she re
nai.-ed for 3 or 4 days, when her mother
and sone other relative called at the house
andl denanded to see her. She wa- not
the within, and ite persons whet called,
either supposing that they would not be
permitted to see her, or for some other rea
%on, acted 4o rudely, that in order to avoid
