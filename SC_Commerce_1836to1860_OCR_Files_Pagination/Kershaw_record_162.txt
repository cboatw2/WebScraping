Licentiate of Apothecary's Company, Fellow
of Bolt Court Society Surgeon to the Royal
Union Pension Association, Lancaster Place,
Waterloo Bridge, and perpetual pupil of Gay"9
and St. Thomas's Hospit ,1s, hondoh.
This valuable medicine, the result of twenty
years' experioice and unparralleled success in the
extensive and highly respectable practice of the
proprietor, patronised by the faculty and nobility,
is now introduced to the notice of the American
public, ai lue earnest solicitation 01 a number or
Jfentlemen of long and high standing in the piocssion.
It is hoped, as a preliminary step, to
check the evils and fatal consequences arising
from the use of the numeinus deleterious nostrums
foisted upon the public hy the aid of fabricated j
proofs of miraculous cures, and other frauds, by a
set of mercenary, nnprinridled pretenders, so to- :
tally ignorant ot medical science that it is impossible
the monstrous delusion can any longer go]
down with the intelligent people of this coiJVRry.
These pills, mild ana agreeable in their nature,
should be kept in every family in cases of sudden
illness, for by their prompt administration, cliole 1
ra, cramps, spasms, fevers, And other alarming ,
complaints, which too often prove fatal, may be , 1
speedily cured or prevented. In fact, all those 1
who value good health slionld never be without I!
them. They arc sold in packets, at 50 cents, $1,
and $2 each, by every respectable druggist, book-1
seller, and vender of medicine in the United -tates

The force required to work it, is abobt the same as
Lhat necessary to move an equal number of saws in
the common Gin. This Gin has been put in
operation in New Orleans lor two or three weeks,
and its success tested in the presence of a large
number of planters, merchants and others, and
received theft general approbation. .
Several gentlemen have beeh so kind as to give
the Patentee their written opinion respecting the
merits of the Gin. A number of others could be
added, but the following are deemed sufficient:

Dr. A. Jones?Sir, In replv to your enquiry,
whatl think of your improved Cotton Gin, 1 have
to say, that I saw it work on Saturday the 25th inst.
and was very much pleased with its performance.
The mere fact of its self-feeding-, seems to me to
be a very valuable improvement; and besides, the
quality 01 ine cotton, an it comes out of the process,
appeared to ine to be better and cleaner than
from the common Gins in use, and that it saves
Considerably in labor. Respectfully, &o.
E. D. WHITE.

From Mr. G. Senior, a Machinist of New Orleans.
Dr. A Jo';et,? Dear Sir, in answei tc your, inquiry
of my opinion of your Patent Cotton Gin, I
beg leave to state, that 1 was fifteen ycurs enga(;ed
in the cotton factories of Manchester, Eirgan'd,
and during four years of that time, 1 was .
foreman in the house of Messrs. Lewis, Williams
I A Co., and near five years spinner in the house'of
Messrs. Sun'dford A Greene. 1 have seen your
Cotton Gin in operation, and hare examined the
cotton ginned by it, and pronounce it belter clean
sea, ana me staple less injured, than any cotton
that ever came under my observation, it is completely
ready /or the breaker without the aid of the
blower, and would, therefore, save the first process
fn manufacturing ,the article. 1 consider cotton
cleansed by your Gin, would command from one
to two cents on the pound more than the average
crops brought into the Manchester market, and
cleansed by common ,Gins Yours, very resp'ly.

of planters in any of the sea port towns of the cotton
planting States, at the above prices, the njrenls
paying the freight on the sainc from New York,
and becoming responsible for !he nmountof the Gin.
It is desirable, when planters give orders for Gins,
they should accompany them with their views in
regard to the arrangement of saws, breasts, brush*
! es, &c. It is found they differ in opinion Pcn.o
desire saws of larger diameter than others. The
j most common size is 9 or JO inches ; but some with
' them 12 inches. Some wish 5 or 0 rows of brushes
: oh an axle, while others do not want more than 4
I at most. Some wish saws with 8 or 9 teeth to the
inch, while others want 10 or 11. With so much
1 discrepancy, we prefer they should, at the time of
giving orders, furnish a statement of 1l?eir w-ishes,
and the inanufacturerers can fulfil them in every
particular. Where it is left to our discretion, we
shall make them on the most modern and approved
plan. An order can be executed, from the time it
is received, in the space of eight or nine weeks,
and the Gin in that time placed in the hands of the
factor. To be in time for the next crop, all orders
ought to be in the hands of the manufacturers by
the first or middle of May; except for plantations
where they are late in commencing to pick or gin
cotton.
N. 1).?The Patent Right, for any one of tbo
cotton growing States, will be sold on reasonable
