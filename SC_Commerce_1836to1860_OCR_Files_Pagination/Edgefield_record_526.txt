The Senate then proceeded to elect the
Chairmen of the several Standing Coin
mittees, and the following was the result;
Foreign Relations.-Mr. Rives.
Finance-Mr. Clay.
. Commerce-Mr. Huntington.
-Manufactures-Mr. Evans.
Agriculture-Mr. Linn.
Military Affairs-Mr. Preston.
Militia-Mr. Phelps.
Naval Afrajrs-Mr. Mangnm.
Public Lands-Mr. S~mith, of Indiana.
Private Land Claims-Mr. Bayard.
Indian Affairs-Mr. Morehead.
Claims-Mr. Graham.
- Revolutionary Claims-Mr. Dixon.
Post Office and Post Roads-Mr. Hen
derson.
* Roads and Canals-Mr. Porter.
Pensions-Mr. Bates. .
District of Columbia-Mr. Merrnek.
Patents-Mr. Prentiss.
- Contingent expenses of the Senate-Mr.
- White.
-On Engrossed Bills-Mr. McR oberts.
* On the Public Buildings-Mr. Barrow.
Of the above, but two are Democratic,
the Chairmen of the Committee on Agri
culture, and on Engrossed Bills, two of
the most unimportant Comiuees in the
.body, and bestowed more in the way of
taunt than compliment. Mr. Linn, how
ever, has the talent and energy of charac
ter to make the Committee on Agriculture
what it should be from the interest which
it is designed to represent-One of the most
important of the Senate. When Federal
jam developes its schemes of extortion and
aggrandizement-its plans for enabling the
stock jobber, the wealthy manufacturer
and the speculator, to revel in luxury on
the proceeds of the labor of the industrious
farmer and planter, and the foreign fund
monger to realize his tenth of the pro
-- coeds of the American soil-then I trust
that the Senate and the country will hear
;from the Committee on Agriculture, and
the mode by which the drones in the social
bive prey upn their more industrious fel
lows be flydeveloped. H ow short a
time since Fderlism claimed to be the
special guardian of the interests of the far
mer, and the tenant of the log cabin, and
yet. the Federal majority in the Senate
save unceremoniously and remorsely con
iged them to the tender mercies of those
whom they then pretended were their
worst enemies.
During the, pretended election of the
Chairmen of the Committees, your distin
.guished Senator, Mr. Preston, played a
iconieous part "according to his medi
crity," and was not for a second "unin
tentloally or accidentally" absent. As
the Committees were called, he drew from
his "breeches pocket" a package of ballots,
properly'labolled, and would distribute
them the Federal Senators, and-while the
ballots were being deposited in the boxes,
he would stride across the charmber, with
a swaggering draweaneir-air, for the pur
.os o ;aq.,iti the Democratic Senators.
Vsfelfgang,' to inowmhat in the Senate,

appreciaied as he deserves, and looked upon
'as the mere parasite and -errand boy of

From the character of this organization,
the country may easily. conjecture the
character of legislation iutended. The re
pal of the Independent Treasury the es
tablishment of a National Bank, the dis-.
tributioni of the Land Reiiynue, tlhe iucrease
of Taxes, and a: General Bankrupt Law,
will be brought forward in rapid succes
sion, and anefforgmade to carry them
through Congress, when there is no direct
evidence of the wishes of the great mass of
the nation respecting these important mea
sures : Mr. Clay this morning offered his
resolution for the repeal of the Snli-Troas
ury. It was modified 'atthe suggestion of
Mr. Wright, so as to iostrust t 6-Com
'mittee on Finance-to iaqui-eV into the ex
pedioncy of repealing. Mt. dalhoun op
posed the resolution,as the whole subject
of thefinances and ''h hent ota
- arady relre e -
tei Committee, and we sh6uld await
their report before action was asked' on
any isolated measure connected withthe
general subject. If it was determined,
however, to send this matter to theZCom.
mittee on Finance, they should also be in
structed to report a substitute. Let those
who wished to. repeal the Independent
Treasury Law boldly come out with their
substitute, and then the Senate and the
country would be enabled 1o examine and
decide between them. Mr. Clay conten
ded that the Independent Treasury should
be repealeli if there was no substitute under
heaven; but~ as to the substitute, there was
no concealment, no mystery intended.
He and the friends who acted with him,
went for a Bank of the United States. Mr.
Calhoun still opposed the resolution, as
acting on an isolated measure, which if
repealed, by this resolution, would leave
the alternative a Bank of the U. States,
or the State Bank deposite system. With
a view of testing the sense of the Senate,
he proposed an amendment to the .resolu
tion by adding to it the words "and to re
port as titute." This was negatived 27
to 19, andIIr. Clay's resolution was pas
sed.
This mannuvring of Mr. Clay evidently
indicates diversity of sentiment in the
Whig ranks, and a consciousness of his
inability to carry the Bank until the Stib
Treasury is repealed. By uniting the
friends of the different systems antagonist
to the Sub-Treasury, he expects to destroy
it; and that accomplished, and the alterna
tives being a National Bank anid the State
Banks, he hopes to carry his favorite mea
sure.
In the House, the greater part of the
day was consumed in the debate on re.
scinding the 21st rule respecting Abolition
petitions. Mr. A dams (A bolitiou Whig)
and Mr. Wise (Republican Whig) Iashedi
each other without mercy. A report was
received from the Secretary of the Treasu
ry, which is said to contain the plan of
"such a fisCal agent as will remove all(
scruples touching the question of constitu
tional power." The report was ordered
to be printed. After directing the Speaker
to appoint the Standing Committees, the
House adjourned over until Monday next.
WASHINGTON, June 4. j
At the op ening of the Senate this'morn
ing, Mr. Clay rose and stated that he*was
instructed by the Committee on FinanceI
to report a bill for the repeal of the Sub
Treasury law, which he moved might be
ordered to a second reading, and made the1
order of the day for Monday next. Mr.
Wright desired that the bill might be read,
and gave notice that he would object to itsi
second rea'ding to day. The bill was thenI
read, and 1. as follows:I

The transactions in' either~branch of
ongress to-day were of~h'lfy iiteresting

Resalid tlierefore, As the opinion of
Weenate, That the following subjects
stif not exclusively, to engage the
deliberations sof Congress at the present
session, viz:
S'Th'e repeal of the-Sub-Treasury;
. 2.Th- incorporation of a bank adapted
to the writs'of the jefiale;"d of the Gov
ernment;,:
3. The poVision of an idequate revenne

debt creqated by the last Administration;
4. The prospective distribution of the
proceeds of the public lands;
5. The-passage of necessary appropria
-tion bills; and
6. Some modification of the banking
system of the District of Columbia for the
benefit ofthe people of the District.
Resolved, That it is expedient to distri
bute the business proper to be done at this
session,-between the.,Senate and House of
Repiresentatives, so as to avoid both Houses
acting on the same subject at the same
time.
These, it is probable, with slight modi
fication will be adopted by the Senate.
Mr. Bayard, from the Select Committee
to consider on a proper token of respect and
'affection for the memory of President Har
risoi, reported a resolution that the chairs
of the. presiding officers, in the Senate and
House, should be shrouded in black during
'th: *remainder of the session, and that the
membriof Congress wear crape for thirty
dajis-,and another of condolence and re
spect -fr the widow.- These were unani
mously adopted. The old officers of the
Uonate were then almost unanimously re
'elected. The Chair then announced the
special order-the bill to repdal the Inde
pendent Treasury. After the bill was
read, Mr. Clay spoke at some length as to
"tie effectef the repeal, which would be
"the revitva of the act of 1836, regulating
the deposites of the public money in State
Banks.' He supposed no Senator was in
favor of a revival of this law, and to avoid
the inconvenience, 'which its existence
might occasion to the Executive diArg the
period of five or six weeks, .'hich might
itervene between the repeal' of the Sub
Treasury, and the passage of a Bank Bill,
.he offered adnamndment to the bill under
consideration, to come in as a third section,
which proposed to repeal thi deposite act,
withtbe exception of that part rilatigg to
the deposite of the surplus, revenue with
the $tatos. The amendment having been:
read Mr. Calliouf said, if he. rightlyn-uh
derstod lhiemarksof Mi. Clay,i s ob
.-. .this amiadifi'nt w
smne passage'b 1*
which would' incapacitate nanfo t0 E
lanksfrom being depositories of the pub
lie money. But there wasca more easy
and direct way of attaining his- object, by
simply moving torepeal so much of the law
as contained these prohibitions. That law
had been passed by almost unexampled
majorities,' inder a conviction that it was
wrong to 'leave the public moneys under
the absolute control of the Executive.
But now it was proposed to re-establish
the state ofthings which was then so loudly
and'so- justly denounced. And on what
plea. Why that in-a few weeks Congress
would pass a law establishing a bank; but
if that expectation should not be realised,
then-the entire public treasure would' be
left under the absolute control of the Exe
cutive. -Mr. Clay. -It would be under the
control of the law of 1789. Mr. Calhoun
said if the Senator in good faith meant to
go back to the law of 1789 he would most
cheerfully go with him.' If that was his
intention, let him move a6 amendment, de
tilaring that the law of 1789 is herehy re
vived. That lawv declares the reveqgpe
shall be received in gold and silver o nTy,
and that the public revenue shall be, not
delposited in banks, hut kept by the Treas
urer of the United States, These remarks
of Mr. Calhoun completely unveiled the
scheme of Mr. Clay and its results, and
soon after, Mr. Rives atid then Mr. Barrow,
a Whig Senator from Louisiana took
ground aghinst the proposition of Mr. Clay,
and coineided in the views of M~r. Cal
houn, and even Mr. Prestoni expressed
himself somewhat to the effect. But as
Mr, Clay lost his friends, he lost his tem
per, and he taunted Rives with his ricketty
bantding of a State Bank deposite system.
Mr. Rives replied with much animation
and declared he would soer follow prin
ciple than the lead ofeven the distinguish.
ed Senator from Kentucky. Mr. Berrien
obtained the floor, when Mr. Clay expres
sed a wish to withdraw his amendment;
but Mr. Berrien declined to yield the floor,
and the Senate on his motion adjourned.
It seemed to bei generally admitted that
thegreat leader of the Whig party showed
most conclusively that he was totally unfit
foir the position to which he has assigned
himself. in the Senate. He manifested
equally a wanit of tact and a want of temn
pet. The ease with which Mr. Calhoun
compelled him to sh'ow his hand, and his
petulant remarks to' Messrs. Rives and
Barrowr, and at other Whig Senators who
he said were prepared to follow their lead,
contrast most strikingly. with thme sagacity
andself possession of the late -Chairman
of the Finance Committee, Mr. Wright.
His game has been to put out of the way
every alternative to a Bank, that when the
charter is presented to the President he may
have no alternative but to sign the bill, or
incur the odium of keeping - the public
moneys lunder the control of the Executive
agents.. -imt wo efforts-to-day for this pur
pose, he has met a rebuff, and appearances
strongly indicate that they are the precur
sors of a more signal rebuke.
In the House, after a sitting of nearly
seven hours, which ivaa occupied in deba

-WasssrNGon,~uned8, 1841.
In the Senate to-day various resoluti6ns
of inqpiry;submitted lastweek-by-Mr. Ben
ton in relation-to the 9p6ions 'of -the
Treasury Departmeit eer to.
The resolution proposed t .vieav
inquiring in the causes of thiilicemant
of Gen. Arbuckle from his command-, was
then taken up. Mr. Preston opposed iton
the ground of the impropriety of interfrr
ende between the. head of the War-De
partment and a-subordinite.- A soldier'*
first duty was obedience, and if he felt ag
grieved, the military tribunals were open
to him for redress. Mr. Sevier said he be
lieved it was a principle of the Govern
ment that the military was subordinate to
the civil power, and contended-thai the in
quiry was perfectly in order. - He alluded
to Gen. Arbuckle's long and valuable ser-.
vices. He was an officer of forty yeairs
standing. He had been in command of
the frontier of Arkansas for twenty years,
and had discharged his duties in the most
satisfactory manner. And now he had
been exiled from his command to the post
of Baton Rouge, where there was but one
solitary soldier and his family. This was
done by the Secretary of War to gratify
John Ross, whose enmity Gen. Arbuckle.
had excited by carrying out faithfully the
orders of the former Secretary of War.
Further remark was cut off by the Chair
announcing the special -order-the bill-to
repeal the Independent Treasury. Mr.
Berrien spoke at-some length against Mr.
Clay's amendment, and was in favor of a
simple repeal-of the Sub-Treasury, leav
ing the public moneys under the regula
tions of the deposit act, until a perniament
substitute was adopted-e Mr. Walker op
posed Mr. Calhoun!s' amendment, on the
ground that it was a sanction of the State
Bank Deposite system, which he .utterly
repudiated as the worst possible system
within the pale of the Constitution. He
was warmly in favor of the Sub-Treasury
in opposition to all substitutes, but that was
to be repealed, and let what would be the
consequences, he never would, by a vote
of his, assist in re-establishing the Pet Bank
system. Mr. Calhoun said the Senator
from Mississippi had mistaken the alterna
tives.. -The Sub-Treasury might be re
pealed, and yet no substitute adopted.
Then-would it not be preferable to have
the revenues of the Government under the
regulation of law, than under the control
of the Executive ? The question-then was
really-between a.State Bank system regu

voting-in favor'of it,-and Mr. Watk'6 Do
mocrat)'-insopposition;. The question was
then taken on Mr. Clay's proposition'ias
amended, and it was lost-19 to 29, Mr.
Clay and the oi her Whigs all votIng against
it. Mr. Clay then gave notice that under
no circumstances would he suppot the
State Bank system, and if the gentlemen
on the other side chose to range themselves
under the banners of such a miserable fleet,
he did not care care under tohat commodore,
he was ready to meet them, and had no
dloubt of the result. Mr. Calhoun said the
Senator from Kentucky was *fghting
agaiist an i maginary flag if-lhe supposed
that Senators on that side of the House
meant to contend for the State Bank sys.
temn. IHe would find that every man of
them was ranged under the glorious ban
ner of the independent Treasury, *nnd let
the battle conme when it might they would
do their duty gallantly and faithfully in its
behalf. As to the "miserable fleet," spo
ken of by the Senator, the Senate had just
declared by a solemn votc, called forth too,
on a proposition of the Senator'himself to
destroy it, that the system of which they
formed a part, was to romain the law of
the land. Thus failed the attempt of the
Kentucky Senator to corner Congres, end
to coerce the Executive. Various amend
ments were then offered to the biill, one of
which was that the Bank of the United
States at Philadelphia should not be en
trusted with the deposites, but they were
all voted down by the majority. The bill
was eventually ordered to be engrossed by
a vote of 30 to 16. Mr. Buchanan, under
instructions, voting with the majority.
In the House, the standing committees
were announced. They have the same
Clay complexion as those of the Senate.
Considerable dissatisfaction was manifest
ed upon the announcement, and several
changes have since been made. Mr. In
gersoll gave notice of a motion to recon
sider the vote op Adam's resolution re
specting Abolition petitions. The House
then went into an election for a Sergeant
at Arms, and Mr. Dorsey an old and faith
ful incumbent of the officee, was compelled
