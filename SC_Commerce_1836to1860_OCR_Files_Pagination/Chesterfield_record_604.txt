he following sketch of the debate to the J
Hous.1 of Representatives, on Friday and Sat. c
urday last, on the bill *to amen i the Consti. 1

corporation." tl
BILL.
Be it enacted, die., That every charter 1 6
of incorporation hereafter granted in this ^
State, shall at all time* remain subject to ai*
deration, amendment, or repeal by the legisla. ?
live authority." "
Mr. Rhett opened the discussion. He It
boo?d that there would be no division in the
House. The bill was intended to exercise g
a wh desome restraint. It could have no
effect on corporations now existing. But a , ^
taiutary pow? r was* reserved by it to ail sue- j
cessive legislatures.
,tf,*. Phillip was opposed to the bill. It &
gave the Legislature a reserved power which ji
would be so inconsistent with the grant of p
charters of incorporation t^a' 1 o individuals
would ho found who won d uni e while the j
Legislature h id a power ul dissolvng them at
will. 8
M". Bhck, of Rich! tnd, followed on the
aine s;d?\ a
Mr. II. II. Thompson was in favor o' the ii
bill. The abu-o-s of corporations were so v
. grp*t tnat it was absolutely necessary to J
apply a corrective to thein.
Mr. Frost moved to am-nd the hill by confin
ii|f it to corporations ??r hanking purposes. .
an I addressed the Hou-e at hmg'h ?n favor j 1
of his amendment and m oppositio to the *
^eflcral ptinriplos of the bill.
u Mr. Henry, of Sp rtaubursrh. wan glad n
tha* the amendment had been otf-red. lire. 5
lieved him of some d flri.riilt v. He wou'd su j
port the amendment and \v is opp?*i d to the ;
Mr. Magrath was npp-ised to the amend- !
nn-nt and also to the'bill, lie saw no reason j
why any difference sh u'd be made between j
corporations lor banking purposes and enrpnr. j
aiions for other purpo-e*. The evil in 1 (j
corporations of all kinds was the tendency j ^
they induced to confide in tic m; and the!
frequent bankruptcies which ruined those who j "
Confided in them. This was an ev.| c >mmon 1 ri
to all corporations, and it i- the true evil to be ( n
corrected. The bill in its prov si ?ns d d not j h
furnish 'he remedy. It punished the stock- J c
holders, hut it punished the cred>'ors and 1 ^
sufferers also. Its operations would be lo j j
annul the charter of a corp? ration?to compel j
J _ ev.... ! o
iijc corporation in wind up i:s anairf, wu?-u
such a consequence would be ruinou* to those i l'
who were creditors. The object.or to the tl
hill is that it afford* no guarantee from the i p
stockholders as individuals to general credi-j s<
tors, while a tyr.tnnical jowor is reserved 1 ti
the State. He would go for a provision that p
would make stockholders, in proportion to
fhetr shares, responsible to creditors in case ll
of the bankruptcy of a corporation. 0
Mr. Perry, from Greeny lie, followed on the <>!
same side and in opposition to the hill. g
Mr. Davie, from Chester, was in favor of a
the bill. He did not consider the objection
to the bill good. It was competent for the f.
Leg slature u? make such regulations as would
preserve the rights of creditors as well as ,f
s" holde-8. The quest.oti was one het\
.en these corporations and the State. He ti
wap more inclined to trust the S'ate. He si
denied that the Legislature wou'd ever be < ,
found dispossd to exercise tyrannical conduct rr
towarcs corporations. ^
Mr. Afcnrninger addressed the House at ! .
length in support of the bill, tie contended
that it. was right that this power should he in Sl
t ie State. It would not be abused; He *j
believed the State had the right no .v. C

Mr. Car roll, of Barnwell. addressed the <?
House in opposition to the hill, and con- v<

make stockholders liable in proportion to t|
the shares held at the time of failure, or j V
for one year pievious?and that this fog. ! p

Mr. H H Thompson, moved to strike S

was in the constitution. i h
.Mr. Belli !?? r did not understand how ir
the friends of the lull, from the Commit- it

surd,-. . j e
* Mr. Menuninger. moved to lay the . r?

Mr. Adams, moved to amend, by in- ; ai
verting, that no hanking corporation.shall j '|'
he chartered, unless uiih tiie concurrence ' a<
of two-thirds of each house, and that the ! fi
same may be dissolved with a vote ofje'
I wo- thirds. 11
On motion the limitation to hanking w
was stricken out, and the amendment was i o
laid on the table. j n
Mr. Burt, of Abbeville, addressed the tl
ILitise in siiunurt of the bill fjom the ! fi
? ? ? rr - - ,
committee. , j si
Mr. Specrs, of Laurens, was opposed il
to (he hill, fie thought it violated some , h
of the fundamental provisions of the con- j n
utitution. If substantial relief was to he j n
afforded, it could only he done bv the ! a
passage of such a bill as was proposed by w
Mr. Carroll. t<
Mr. Walker, of Charleston, felt some i J
hesitation in entering into the discussion. , (
His opinions during the last session were ' ;V
in opposition to the law of the last se*. ! ti
liioii. He deprecated the idea of the j n
Legislature interfering at all with the j p
concerns (*f corporations. They had ; a
\fc??ted rights. We could not tourfh. v
them. He was opposed to riieddiing with ti
the constitution. The same purp?ise b
might be effected by a general act. To > n
touch \he constitution, without pressing j ti
necessity was a telcm, arid therefore per. j p

lie difference in opinion in the house, on
lie subject, was, in his opinion, a-strong
eason against taking the vote now. He
enied the truth of the position that a
harter waa a contract. It was absurd
o say that bonus paid by a bank was
ny thing more than an equivalent for
axe*.
Mr. Memminger insisted that the house
hould return to-the true question. All
hat has been said amounts to a distrust
f the Legislature, There was no founation
for this, while the necessity for
;gislation was strong and pressing,
Mr. Myers billowed, and replied at
ome length to the remarks of Mr. Hunt.
Mr. Sims of Darlington, insisted that
he friends of the bill wished to bring
ark the constitution to what it waa oriinally.
It had, through the process of
ndicial exposition, departed from first
irinciples.
The question was then tnken on send
rig the hilt to the Senate and watt lost by
vote of 61 to 46.
Mr. Hunt, then moved the following
9 an amendment. That no charter of
neorporation should he granted, except
kith the concurrence of two*thirdsnf the
legislature?and that all charters so
[ranted, shall he revoked hy a vote of
wo thirds of the Legislature, unless there
< contained in the charter an express ex*
million.
Mr. Perrv, strongly objected to the
mondment, and it was lost by a vote of

Your liberal views on Agriculture inure
me to vivo you some sketch of the
ebnte on that subject, which took place
n Tuesday. Mr. R>per called up the
ejxirt of tlie Committee ??n Agriculture
n?l moved the resolutions he rend and
dopted. A proposition was offered to
onsider them separately, nnd the two
rst expressing the great advantages to
e derived from an Agricultural Survey
i the State, were adopted ; hut when the
lird was approached, which appropriated
le means of effecting this desirable purose,
a great many political?financial?
wial?scientific and superficial objecons
were marshalled against it. Mr.
'aimer thought we might procure a sta
stical account of the value of the lands
f the Slate from the tax book?that a gelogical
survey of the slate might do some
ood, but where could a man be procured
broad, who could teach how to plant
otten. Mr. Davie thought no good
ould result, he was satisfied with the
?x hook, and the exertions of the district
gricultura) societies. Mr. Frost would
ot vote for the appropriation till he could

Mr. Middleton was for a geological

grirni! tirai survuv. jri r. *??<- imn^ci,
lhairman of the comrri'f '.ee of Way* and
leans, the great high priest of the ternle
of our mammon, approached, and put
ie sword of the State to the throat of the
ictim, pronounced n kind of funeral panjyrio
on the merits of the intended sactiee,
how we all lived bv agriculture, and
iiw he hoped one of these days to be a
itary himself; but declared that $3000

ould require $30,000 to effect a survey,

ould not effect a useful object, and there
ere no means in the trensury. Mr.
erry,?who last year delivered an address
n agriculture, avowed he had been caught
nting for internal improvements, and
ould not be caught again. Meantime
ih friends of the measure were not idle.
Ir. Roper maintained thit an agricultu.
t! survey was necessary to develope the
irririiliural manures and resources of the
late, that this would retain our migrating
upulation at home, nnd hy the improve,
lent of our lands create valuable capital
ir the State to tax upon, and so increase
er resources; that we expended too
inch for w hat we could produce at hotne
i the necessaries of life, as two millions

e could so easily produce, was carried

ill road to other parts of the country,
le mentioned the object of an agricultu>1
survey and maintained its advantages
t this time over a geological survey.?
'he people were not prepared to take
dvar.lage of the last; while, from the
rst. immediate advantages would flow to
very class of the community throughout
le State. Gen. Adams nnintained that
bile something wa-> done for every
l her class of people throughout the State.

ie tax collector could not give the in.
>rmation required by an agricultural
iirvey?that we wanted the manured of
ie State sought out and analyzed, and
t* called on the planter* to unite on the
icnsure. Mr. Carroll said the property
f tt?e State was valued at one hundred
nd ninety.two million, of dollars, of
diirh the agricultural portion amounted
> one hundred and seventy-four million,
/r. ?Bellinger begged leave to inform the
'hairinan of the committee of Ways and
leans, that there were $5500 in th/?
easurv, the balance of a fund formerly
ppropriated, an i not now required, indc nrlent
of furt'ier taxation. Mr. Rhett
Iso said that there were $3500, which
ould not be r quired, for nn appropriaion
for the College Library, that might
e employed f >r thin survey-?thathe whs
o planter, but was aware of the ad vanriges
to he derived from fostering thnt
ijrfttiit?that wc were foremost in passing
bstract resolutions on government, whilo
her Stnt'e were fa* outstripping us in
improving: their internal reaources?that
South Carolina would s6on tag behind
the age. Mr. Henry* in * liberal and
polished speech, advocated the survey?
adverted to the advantage* proceeding
from Van Nu? em Y researches, and the
fine quality of iron ore. now produced in
Spartanbjrgh, and spoke also of the other
indication* of mineral and other' wealth
hid in the enrlh, which ought fo he fought
out and employed. Mr.' Phole moved
the indefinite postponement of the reaolutions,
for the purpose, 'he said of inviting
discussion, saving of $3 500 from
the College and Library'blight moderate
the taxes to that amount; JSfr. Roper,
on the indefinite postponement; called
for the yeas and naya, when {he'propoai.
tion was voted down. At last, after a lit*
tie more skirmishing, a final*'vote was
taken on granting the appropriation
wnen ine yeas anu naya were agmn
railed for by Mr. Roper, and the question
decided by a majority of about 20, if I
recollect right, against the apptapriatiop.
I am told this van the moat favorable vote
the Legislature* has ever made on the
subject. If the planters arid farmers
could have agreed, they vvnuJdhave car.
' ricd it; but we realize thn OiMe'of the
dragons' teeth and tyring armed from the
aoil to destroy each other. The :Hous?
was rather in favor of an agTiddltu'rill sur.
vey, bul because the friends of axgeologi.
cal survey could not, accomplish,, their
object, they rejected any .expefiment.
The Senate was prepared to ,ha*e ic?
corded with any resolution of the House,
and from these petty feelings the measure
was lost. To-day Henry's resolutions
of instruction come up, and somespright

will not agree i0 the doctrine of imttruc.

columbia, dec. 11.1841.
The h'mhc was engaged a const lerable
fH rti'?n of yesterday, in-.. discussing the
prop ?sition io amend the Constitution, ho
a to grant i ow<r to the Legislature to niter
>r amend a c larlcr after granting it. This
discussion was *rnnsferied to this day and
resumed accordingly; and a hard, contes.
o ^ 7
ted controversy it proved. The vote
was at length taken on an. amendment of
(?on. a darns, proposing that only two.
thirds of the Legislature should in future
grant charters, but this resolution was
lost; and the question recurred on the hill
of the committee, to alter the Constitu.
tion, so as to give the L gislatorn power to
amend charters. On this the yeas end
nays were taken arid tne bill lost. Im.
mediately a motion whs made to reconsid.
or. and the yeas and nays railed on that
question and carried. Mr. Hunt then
proposed, that after the enacting clause,
an amendment which he offered should
he adopted. It proposed, that nr. charter
in future should he "ranted unless r?v a
O
majority of Iwn.thirds, the identical pro
position of Gen. Adams, only in other
language; hut the House refuvcd. on n
vote of yeas and nays, to adopt the resolution.
The hill was consequently rejected.
Mr. Memminger then paoved t?
take up the resolution offered hvjhe comI
mittee, and called the veasitnd, mivs on
etery resolution. The first, u deprecating
a suspenaion of specie payments, and
'hat it wan the duty of the Legislature In
prevent its recurrence by lawful and constitutional
means," was carried almost
unanimously. The second, " proclaiming
that a i exemption from legislative
authority by anv class would establish an
aristocracy contrary lolaw," was alsn
carried without dissent. The third, "that
the Bank of the State, the South Western
Rail Road Bank, the Planters and MeR:inL
Mini thp Union RhoU. de.
serve the confidence of the people for their
co-operation with the State in promoting
thrxie measure* which have been deemed
essential to the public welfare," was. very
much dissented from iirtd discussed?not
from opinion* hostile to the import of4be
resolution, hut that it was arraying cor*
poration* against corporations?that .the
Legislature took part with some of these
corporations against others, a position in
which it ought not to be found?that il
was undignified and unworthy of a legislative
b.nly?tlint the resolution was a
pettifh assault on the hanks who refused
to comply with the act of 1840 Those
hanks were not applauded, hut were not
to be condemned for defending what they
considered an invasionof their chartered
rights?and this expression of confidence
in only three banks might by inference
affect the stocks of the hanks alluded to,
and for these reasons most of the votes
ngainst the h:ll were given?gentlemen
thought the resolution unnecessary^ uhcalled
for, ought to be stricken out, and
the Legislature not exhibited as entering
the arena of parly feeling, hut tt)H aye?
and noes had their usual eff et and the
third resolution was adopted. The last
r.'so re had no'hin; pnrticulaifyobjection,
able, and was carried by a<:clain.\ti<m.
This discussion carried us to five o'clock
nni a recess was then taken to half-past
six o'clock. Such labor is pretty severe,
and I trust our constituents will show their
j gratitude on a proper occasion. 1 resuin"
i my pen to say that on again convening
the military bill camp up. An effort to
defeat the encampment system was made
but failed. A party then endeavored to
defeat the bill by parliamentary trick ol
every kind?by constant amendments?
by speaking?by calling t'<?r yeas and
nays?by motions to postpone, to adjourn,
Arc., but the friends of the bill stuck to it
nt two o'clock at night, finally got it ordered
to the Senate, when life House ad.
journed.
THE DISTRIBUTION ACT.
Columbia. Due. 13,1841..
Mr. Perry m?de an able argument thi*
morning agnina.' the resolutions proposi j
to receive the distribution funcf. : H*
maintained that (he act was extremelv
impolitic and unwise, but that it was an
act passed, an1 the question was, bow
eugbt ,8ju1!? Carolina to act V That 'the
SMB=WHB=HH-BH=
States had bought tfie domain of Flor* | the
ida and Louisiana, and the people'* money ! Ada
had paid for it?and the other land* had ^gm
lieen ceded to the people of the United
Stale*. That therefore the distribution j
ft.ml belonged to the people, and the Leg* fDj|(
islature had no right to come between the (
people and their property, and prevent p,|
them receiving, what of right belonged a||(
to them. That the portion allotted to an(|
South Carolina was not her fall share, {
that the people were robbed, but that what gra#
was offered was their own and they ought wa
not to decline receiving it. He said, j \\
however, we ought not to act, now, but (
endeavor to get the act repealed. He
said the reception of the surplus fund was noj(
a principle identical with this, and there ^|ei
was no hesitancy in receiving the amount (
there proffered us. He said we should ne<j
wait for a new representation* and as it
was noi ansoiuieiy necessary in act now, jjar
wait till the money wa? tendered. He ^
then said in proper time he should offer yjc
some resolutions, Mr, Frost, thought we (jei
ought not to take too high ground, it was r
sufficient not to appoint an agent to re. j
ceicr?we would not then be committed ^
?and he moved to strike out the word*. jjar
th? State of * South Carolina will not"
?hut retain the proposition that the #n(
Go vernor he enjoined to appoint no agent (
to receive the money. Mr.. Henry sup. _|
ported Mr. Frost, he was not disposed to (]er
' commit the State ; hut he thought the Mor
monny might remain on deposit till we gj(
could see what ought to be the policy of j
the State. He would give no pledge that
the State would never receive the money.
Mr.. Hunt was glad that gentlemen had
brought the subject to its true issue?they (
were afraid to decli ne the money?we jyje
ought not to play the coquette, but say (?R
at once whether they will receive the pa
money or no:, for the act is unconxtitu. (
tioual. and the money ought to he appro. ?
printed for a naty. The surplus fund
1 wa?a deposit, and ready to b? paid when ^
' public necessity required; and the case
' entirely different from that now proposed. 1
Mr. Rhett thought the resolution did not '
. i ? . i VVi
go as Tar as was wild, it simpiy siaieu **
that this Legislature would not receive I'd
the money?that this Legislature would 1
not bind another Legislature or future 3a
generations of men not to receive a dollar. Hu
He thought the distribution bill, luit n Br
base electioneering bribe, and a party ,
move to elect a particular limn. It will ?)(,
be economy not to receive a dollar?be- q(]
canso we pav more in taxes than we re. ? ,
cvive.' Mr. Palmer thought if genii men
thought the subject was unconstitutional
they were bound to all cternitv to vote a.
* li
gainst them, and ho was not willing to
place the State in an improper position. an
lie was not disposed to commit the State.
Mr. Henry again said he was for postpon- Sis
ingthe action ot the State. He was not Ca
for cutting summersets. It was a dan- ter
gerous feat for grey headed men. and he
] was not disposed to pledge the State at K<
present. Mr. Frost said there wett many gc
contingencies we ought not to anticipate, .j|f
for, if som of the States refused to accept
mid accumulated a fund, and the que*
tiou came up to divide this surplus, how ^
ought we to act ? Swell the proceeds
.to.'those States who were disposed to np. nn
1 press u>?be apprehended not. Mr.
Bellinger thought there was no necessity
to decide the question of receiving
the money now?ought to use every nn
means to produce the repeal of this actnot
to declare now whnt we ought P?>
i <Ia?,K* wmilil nnl i/n further than Hh. I);
dure At prevent we ought not to Appoint H;
' n receiver, and he careful of what Ian.
g?Wge we use non-wait until we find __
the act cannot be repealed, and then say
what he shall do. If we cant do this, we co
wili then receive it; as to refuse it will be
' playing into the hands of other States,
and whilst assisting them we will be rob.
bed. Public lands are common property, '
' and if so, we cannot any how the proceeds ^
of the State shall bo appropriated?-refuse an
to receive what is tendered as her share.
If We refuse the 80 000, the deficiency in ! Mi
the treasury will still have to he supplied J *??i
> .without helping us at all, and the money j YV
left idle. Mr. B. then proposed resolu. I
tions simply saying that the State would Cl
not appoint a receiver of the money, but gj
containing the spirit of the other resolutions
they were received as substitutes. q
