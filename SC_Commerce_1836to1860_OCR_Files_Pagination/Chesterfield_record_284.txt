flouous ; it may be limed at the outset, that
is, before the plough is admitted.
3dly, Thar to lime moorish soils is a haz.
ardous business, unless dung is likewise be
eto wed; but to repeat the application upon
such soils, especially if they had been sev
crely cropped, is almost a certain loss, and
that a compost of lime and rich earth is, in
such cases, the only subs-itute.
4thJy, That strong loams and clays require
a full dose to bring them into action ; such
soils being capable of absorbing a great
quantity of calcareous matter. Lighter soils,
howover, require less lime to stimulate tnem,
and may be injured by administering a
quantity that would prove moderately bene,
ficial to those of a heavy nature.
5ibly, That upon fresh land, or land in
a proper state for calcareous application,
lime is much superior to dung. Its effects
continue for a longer period; while the
crops produced are of a superior kind, and
less susceptible of injury from the excesses
of drought and moisture Finally, the
ground, particularly what is of a strong nature,
is much easier wrought; and, in many
instances, the saving of labor would almost
tempt a judicions farmer to lime his land,
were no greater benefit derived from the
application, than the opportunity thereby
gained of working it in a perfect manner.
It may be added, that though s rong soils
require to be animated with a good dose ot
lime, those of a light texture will do equally
well with little more than huiC iiie quantity
requisite on the o hers, especially if they are
fresh, or have not already received an a p.
plication of calcareous matter. In every |
case it is the farmer only w ith can judge of
the quantity to be given ; but, as a general
principle, it is safer to exceed the proper
quantity than to be below it. In the latter
case the application may prove useless, and
the whole expense be lost; whereas it rar ly
happens that injury is sus:ained from an ex.
cess, especially if more or less dung is soon
after administered.

"Farmers are not agreed as to what depth
beneath the surface dung should be placed,
in order to be rendered the most availing.
Do not farmers frequently bury their ma
nure so deep as to impair its good effects ?
I believe that dung exerts its power to the
greatest advantage when placed pretty near
the surface, but more light on this subj- ct
is needed. Although when placed near the
surface, it may do the most good to the next
crop, yet is this the position which should
be gives it when tbe greatest ultimate profit
is the object aimed at ?" A Farmer.
A proper answer to this query would fill
n volume, as it would embrace an account
of the different soils, the action of manure
upon each, the ktod of manure most proper
for each variety, since all these things
have a direct bearing on the subject.
We however can only say that all vege.
tables and animal substancee which under.
go decomposition, contain more or less of
the elements necessary to the growth of
plants; and the great cbj ct of applying
? ?- - ?.i i IT
manure is to mane uitjiu aiiuru as mucfi j
soluble matter as possible to the roots of I
the plants, and that in a gradual manner.
Mineral manures, however, it is supposed
do not act on the principle of nutrition, but
of excitability.
If then, in the use of putrescent manure,
or dung, the great object is to present it so
that the roots of the plant will most readily
be benefitted by the soluble matter afforded
to them it appears to us that covering to a
great depth would be entirely subversive of
that end. Were we to give a definite opinion
on the subject it would be to plough
deep?to render the earth mellow and friable
to as great a depth as possible, so that
the roots could easily penetrate,?but to
hury the manure lightly. It should all be
buried however, as that is we thi tk indispensable
to the greatest benefit from its op.
plication. We would plough deep that the
surface water of rains, &c. could easily
sink and not drown,the young plants, and
that the roots by penetrnting to some depth,
should not be liable to leave the plant to
suffer from drought; and we would cover
the manure not too deep, because a slight
covering ofearth is sufficient to absorb the
gases that escape from manures during
their decomposition and afford most valua.
hie nutriment to plants, and because seeds
or plants throw out the most abundant roots
near the surface, and of course it is there
they will soonest find the nourishment they
require.
We may on this point have the misfor.
tune to differ from some of our agricultural
friends, but we think our position most consonant
with correct reasoning and expertments
; and besides, we find ourselves supported
by higtinames in the annals of farming.
Sinclair in his Code of Agriculture, and
v Brown, in his woik on Agriculture, make
in substance the foliowiug remarks.
"Notwithstanding what has been already
said respecting the practice of those farmers
who allow manure to lie for a long time
upon the surface of the earth, we however
agree with the opposite opinion?that it
should be spread as taken from the cart,
and completely incorporated with the soil
for by tillage it becomes amalgamated with
the inert particles of the earth through which
means both that and the dung form one substance
in the fittest state to promote the
growth of vegetation. It should not however
be buried too deep at first; for though
it is the prevailing opinion of many persons,
that by deep covering, the dung is defended
from the injurious effects of exhalations?
that the roots of plants soon find their way
to it?and that it will be raised higher by
after ploughings?yet there are men of accurate
observation, who, from long experience,
have found, that if dung be only just
covered, the nearer it is to the surface the
greater are its effects in promoting fertility,
for then it liesnearthe roots of young plants,
at the time they need the most cherishing
aliment. They also declare, that dung
never rises to the surface, after it has lain
rr/jed for a eesson in the sol!, btit that on
the contrary, as it dissolves in the earth, the f
solution descends as low as the soil has v
been st.rred by the plough." e
Judge Powell, in some ol his valuable ag- r
ricultural papers, remarks that by plough, s
ing deep and high manuring, he had con- f
verted the most of his land into the richest 5
soils as deep as the plough could reach, say 1
12 or 14 inches. This would not have t
been the case, had there not been a contin- t
ual tendency in the manure applied to sink r
as low as the plough has loossened the a
earth, and nothing is wanting to constitute \
soil, where vegetable or animal matter or
mould can be sufficiently mixed or incor. e
poraled with the native earth. The ten- ji
dency to sink, is perhaps more strongly t
shown in the mineral manure, such as lime ii
or marl, than in putrescent ones ; and Ma!- e
colm in his Agricultural Survey says that a
wh* re lime has been used in quantities on c
lands containing considerable sand, but with \
an impervious or hard-pan subsoil, the ef. I
fects of the sinking of the lime has been to c
produce a compact and lime mortar bottom, a
ot course ues ructive 10 vegetation uuui
thoroughly broken up with the plough.
The true course would seem to be, to stir
the earth as deep as possible, to make the
surface intended for the seeds and the roots
of the young plants perfectly fine and friable
to incorporate with this surface earth
the manure, covered so that nothing of its
power should tsrapn Airing fermentation,
out not so deep as n t to be readiiy accessible
to the roots of the plants. Experience
shows that light dressings placed where re.
quired by the plants, and repeated as often
as necessary, are more profitable to the far.
mer; and by >he lepeat-d tillings being al>
lowed to mix more completely and deeply
in the soil, is more beneficial to the soil,
than heavy dressings placed so deep as to
be a longer time in decomposition or incorporation
with the earth.

Pulverize the Soil*
Few farmers are probably fully aware of
the vast importance of keeping the earth
well pulverized, and especially in seasons
of drought. It has been observed by the
celebrated Mr. Tull, and by many others
since his time, t hat thoroughly pulverizing the
soil, and reducing it to a perfect tilth, in.
creases and extends the pasture of plants.
The soil thus pulverized more readily attracts
the moisture, always floating in the
atmosphere. Mr. Joseph Wimpey says,"I
made several observations which clearly explain,
to my own satisfaction, how dividing
und pulverizing the soil becomes the proper
mode of conveyingthe aliment prepared by
nature for the sustenance of plants, into the ,
bosom of the earth. Ono observation I
will mention, as it is directly to the purpose.
One evening, near the time of the men's
leaving work, a smart shower of rain came
on, which drove them off. They were digging
one of the plots where beans had previously
grown. The shower did not last
more than half an hour. The next morning,
as the men were digging, I observed
that the rain had not penetrated above half
an inch into the ground; I requested one
of them to dig one or two spits of tho P
ground that had been dug the day before, ,
when it clearly appeared that the rain, in
the new.dug ground, had gone as deep as j!
he spade, which wa9 full twelve inches."

Mr. Editor,?To satisfy myself and some t

Sept. to Nov. 1938, inclusive, in the fol- ?

Auction sale at Mew York, 50,000, sold 17 1
to 19 cents per foot, measuring 6 inches *
of the root, averaged 18 cents. A gentle- i
man from Philadelphia, purchased of Dr. t
Stebbins, of Northampton, 125 trees, paid i

1500 trees brought $2900. At Richmond
,0 trees four years old sold at $25 per

int, there is not the least grounds for such
in apprehension, and our opinion is founded

lighest sources, that the demand for the
tlorus Multicaulis will rather increase than
iiminish for at least five years to come, (or
is long as the bounty is continued,) and the
>rices will scarcely be less than at the
present time; for the demand for them is
lot more fthan half supplied. Although
hey have been in this country about 12

Europe and elsewhere keeps up, and the
United States export more silk than they

Let any person the least conversant witf

dings on the Morus Alba, ore not yet all
enumerated. In fact the greatest one is
this. The wood is more hardy and the
buds mnch less apt to swell too soon, when
frost may blast a whole orchard. See the
proofs of my assertion. In the latter part
of February of this year, we had very warm
weather for the season, and the buds of
many trees began to swell, among which
were the Morus Multicaulis, which I have
every winter but the first, allowed to stand
untouched till planting time. On the 3d
and 4th of March, however, we had the
most severe frost experienced her-* for t<ven.

REMARKABLE ANECDOTE Of A DOG. t
The anecdotes given of dogs saving the b
lives of persons in danger of drowning, are *
so numerous as to be familiar to every per.
son. One cannot reflect on the innumerable a
instances of the love and usefulness of this 8
animal, without being grateful to Providence t
for having given to man a creature capable t
of many of those noble and disinterested t
feelings, which we are accus'omed to op- t
preciate so highly in our follow creatures, j
and almost to look upon as constitut ng the
perfection of the human chnracter. At a t
con von in France twenty paupers were
served with a dinner at a certain hour every
day. A dog belonging to the convent did a
not fail to be present at this regale, to re- t
ceive the odds and ends which were now t
and then thrown to him. The gues s, now. t
ever, were poor and hungry, and ol course f
not very wasteful!, so that their pensioner a
did little more than scent the f,-n3t of which i
he would fain have partaken. The portions r
were served by a person at the ringing of g
a bell, and delivered out by menns of what c
in religious houses is called a tour, which t
is a machine Ike the section of a cask thai j
by turning round upon a pivot exhibits what- i
ever is placed on the concave side, without
discovering the person who moves it. One <
day this dog, who had only received a few j
scraps, waited till the paupers were nil gone, J
took the rope in his mouth and rang the bell; \
his stratagem succeeded. He repeated it j
the next day with the same good fortune.? ;

The New York Sun says: In Vernon, |
Ct., is a paper mill, established by the Vernon
Company, at a cost of$25,000, which, 1
for two years past, has been run exclusive- I
ly for the Sun. From this mill we receive j
weekly two hundred reams, or ten thousand i
four hundred reams per year, amounting to (
$31,200. From the Saugerties paper mill, f
and from the mill of Philips di Field, at Lee, \
Mass., we are in the weekly receipt of ,
nearly tho same quantity as from the Ver? ,
non mill, and wc also mako occassional ,
purchases from other mills. In the article |,
of ink, we receive and use two hundred (
pounds weekly?the most of it from the .
manufactory of Johnson & Durant, Philadelphia.
The bills for this article amount to a ,
fraction over $2,600 per year. Of coal, for
our steam engine, we use four tons a week,
or two hundred tons per year; average cost
$1,400 per year. In the various depart,
ments of our office, exclusive of carriers,
we have twenty?seven hands constantly employed,
at a cost of about $300 per week,
amounting to about $18,700 per yearOur

It is said that a grain of musk is capn. i
ble of perfuming, for several years, a cham
ber 12 fret square, without sustaining any
sensible diminution of its volume or its :
weight. But such a chamber contains 2,. i
085,984 cubic inches, and each cubic inch
?ig
ontains 1,000 cubic tenths of inches, niakig
in all, nearly three billions of cubic
nths of an inch No w, it is probable, in.
eed almost certain, that each such cubic
2nth of an inch of the air of the room con.
tins one or more of the particles of the

lany thousands of times. Imagination reoils
before computation of the number of

An esteemed subscriber in Wheatland,
uformed us "yesterday that he had a twenty
,cre field of wheat, which, if nothing inter,
ened to mar the present prospect, would
-it-Id at least fifty bushels to the acre ! And
urther, that he had a small patch of a pe.
uliar kind of barley, where he had planted
wlf a bushel in the spring, from which ho
ixpects to reap atleast forty bushels! Nor
ire these isolated instances. Every where,
n this region, similar indications of unparw
illelled abundance prevail. If good luck
continues with us ten days longer, a larger
:rop of wheat will be gathered than wass
jver before known in Western New York.

Wo not long since cautioned our readers
gainst purchasing tickets in a "Mammoth Lot.
ory" advertised by Sylvester & Co of New York*
he prizes in which consist of real estate and
tank stock in New Orleans. Our chief ground
or adverting to the subject was a publication in.*
i southern paper, denouncing the scheme as one
utended to deceive and rob the public. One* if
iot the only ground spcciefied for denouncing the
ichome was that it is not authorised by any law
if Florida, as it purports to be. Wo have since
leen published the "legal opinion" of tho Hon.
loseph M. White, from which wo copy tho foL
owing paragraph.
"The undersigned has been asked his legal
opinion upon the right ot Messrs. Schmidt &
flainilton to organize and carry into effect a
Lottery under the laws of Florida, ft ap>eara
that an application was made by them
o the Legislative Assembly ot the Territory
or such a privilege, which was granted by the
Senate and Legislative Council, and vetoed by
he Gov- rnor. It was ascertained that by a
)revious act in force, and unrepealed, certain
Commissioners therein named, were authorised
"to raise such sum or sums of money, by
ottery, in such scheme or sctu-mef, as they
nay deem appropriate or advisable,*' to com>lete
a court house and seminary. The comnissionere
have deemed it Appropriate and
idvisable" to adopt his scheme, which they
lave a perfect right to do, so iong as the act
itood in force, and without limitation as to
ime. If it is urged that such an act for such
mrpose, was not intended for so largo an ope ation,
the answer is obvious, that the Legisature
has not specified the extent or duration
)f the scheme. The discretion is given to the
*nmmi.iflinnerfL who have acted UDOn the sub.
ect, and it is uot now in the power of the Go*
rernor, Legislature or Judiciary, to hinder, or
Dbstruct, in any manner, the execution of such
plan as the commissioners shall agree upon."
Although we consi er lotteries of injurious
:ondency we would not, on that account, wil.
ingly do tho least injustice to any of those en.,
gaged in them, among whom are persons of
strict honor and much respectability. It does
certainly seem to bo a strange perversion of an
act passed merely to raise a sum of money by
lottery for building two houses for public parpo.
90s, to disposo of, or sell, under authority of that
act, and only for the benefit of private individuals,
buildings and bank stock in a distant State
to the amount of $1,500,000. Yet it would
seem that such proceeding is lawful ; and so far
as we know, there is no more cause for withhold,
ing confidence from this than from the gcnorali.
ty of lottery schemes. We advert to the subject
now only from a sense of justice to those con.
cerned in the lottery. We repeat, however, as
of general application to all lotteries as well as to
this, our former remark, that they who buy tickets
need hardly expect any thing more than tho
tickets for their money.
The Texans have lately had two battles with
the Indians on thoir frontier oq two successive
days, in both which the Indians were routed.?
The Texans lost 3 men in the first battle, and
bad 5 wounded, Of the Indians 18 were found

ana lost 2 men killed, and had upwards of 20
wounded.
We lately copied a statement published zn the
Globe at Washington, assigning as a reason for
the dismissal of Mr. Campbell the late Treasurer
of the U. States from office his neglect of duty.
The National Intelligencer states that it is
requested by a friend of Mr. Campbell to say
that the statement in the Globe is not true, as
will in due time be made to appoar.
