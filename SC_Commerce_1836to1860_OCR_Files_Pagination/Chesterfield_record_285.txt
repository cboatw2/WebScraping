A New Variety Mulberry Tree.?It issta.
ted by a correspondent of tho Hartford (Conn.)
Congrcgationalist, that two mulberry trees
about four feet high have just been sold in that
| neighborhood for two hundred and sovon dollars.
They are supposed to bo a new variety sprung
from the native red mulberry. Although it is
greatly inferior to the multicaulis in temperate
or warm climates, it will 9tand tho climate of
New England better, and such is the rage for
silk culture in that region <hat the hope of this
new variety suiting them bettor than any other
has caused tho two 6mall specimens of it refered
to, bring tho extraordinary prico of more than )
$100 dollar each. The leaves are represented
to be larger than those of any other mulberry in
this country except the multicaulis, and worms
fed on them are said to make as good silk as
those fed on the white mulberry.
North Carolina Election.?From the Edge,
comb district returns have been received which
render it certain that Mr. Stanly (Whig) is re
elected over Vr. Jtia.i, a lortnor memoer. ncturns
from the Newbern district render it probable
that Mr. Shephard (Van Burcn) is re. elected.
From the other districts, in which the election
took place only yesterday there has not yet been
time to hear.
A free negro from New England, was lately
Bold at auction for ten year's service to pay his
tailor'a bill, in Florida.
If it were a practice to sell tohitt men when
they are foand unable to pay their tailor's bills
the number of dandies would soon diminish
very perceptibly.
The "British Queen," lately arrived in New
York from England, is the largest steamer in the

The flour dealers begin to have hopes of a
good market abroad, it is unsafe to say there
is a certain prospect of a good crop in England,
when we carefully compare a.l the accounts.
In Italy, however, there is a good crop. In
the south of France the season was so far ad.
vanced that a good crop was quite certain.?
In the North of Europe, however, the prospect
was very uncertain, so wet had been the
weather. Flour, upon all this news, refuses
further to succumb in price. It quite holds its
head up to day in the very face of our rich
harvest.
The British Parliament has voted $300,000

It was moved to reduce the sum to $200,000,

American Silk.?We were shown this n
morning several specimens of s;lk manufactur- ti
ed by Mr. Rapp's community at Economy, on A
the Ohio. The whole process of growing and
manufacturing, from the planting of the trees
to the most delicate finish, is carried on by
this enterprising and thriviug association. The
specimens cxhibted to us consisted of vesting
of various patterns, and of admirahle texture
and finish ; velvet of quality equal to any im- ^
ported, sewing silks, and plain silks of various
kinds. The only difference, if any, observable
bet wen these and silks of foreign manufacture
is the absence of some of the lustre which gives
the peculiar rxhness to the latter. Even this
the skill of our artizans will shortly attain, and

the horse rose, his rider at the 6ame time re. tl

1.ATER NEWS FROM EUROPE?ARRIVAL
OF TIIE BRITISH QUEEN.
New York, July 28.
The British Queen is in, with news to the
2th. There is nothing uctter, and mora that is
tad. Cotton fell, fri m the 9th to tho 12th, 3 8
?f a penny more. The rate of interest with the
Sank of England was not changed, but the 6 pei
:ent. was still talked of. The political news is
iot remarkable.
The arrival of this ocean-wonder has created
l great sensation, Sunday though it be. The
:ity is pouring forth to kpo ber. Sho made a
sweep up the North river, heralding her approach
by her own guns, and then took her place in the
East river. Her passage has been fifteen days
and a half. She made Ssndy Hook last night,
but waited for a pilot. Tho wind was generally
dead ahead ail the passage.
Tho budget has been brought into Parliament.
There has been an excess in the actual receipts
of the year, as compared with the Chancellor's
ostimate. The account is rather favorable, but
a budget hardly admits of compression.
Mr. Featherstonaugh is a passenger in the
British Queen, and is one of the Commissioners
to examine into the possibility of simplifying the
question of the Northeastern Boundary. Col.
Mudge, of the Royii Engineers, is another pas.
aengor. They have, it seems, no negotiations to
make, but a reconnoissance to make.
It is estimated in one of the London papers
that the stock of American cotton on hand at
the end of the year will be from 250,000 to 300,.
000 bales.
Money seemed to be a little more plentiful n
England, but the hostility to the, so called, cotton
speculators was unmitigated. The fact that the
rate of interest was not put up, proves tho alarm
to be subsiding in part.
The Letter of our New York corresp mdent,
under date of July 28th. gives the sum and sub.
stance of all the news brought by the steam packet
British Queen. In searching over the extracts
from London papers which have come to haud
by her, the following are the only paragraphs
which appear to be worth transferring, as news,
to our columns:
On tho 8th, Mr. Ilume made a motion in tho
House ofComraons for a select committee to iD.
qA^into the pecuniary transactions of the

payments ; and particularly to ascertain how
far these transactions produced the alarming
crisis of the manufacturing, commercial, and
financial affairs of the country in 1825-6, and in
1836-7; and also to inquire whether, as the
Bank of England is at present constituted, there
ever can be stability in the currency, or confi.
dence in tho commercial transactions of the 1
country.

Waterspout ?The counrry botween j
Stockbridge and Hudson, was deluged on <
Monday by a terrible destructive torrent of rain ,
occasioned by one of these unusual phenomena, t
It took place about 4 o'clock, P. M. and be- j
came known by the passengers in the Hudson c
and Berkshire rail road by the instantaneous s
appearanc of one of the most violent showers
ever witnessed. In that mountanous region <
the accumulated water esquired an immense 1
infyetue, which frequently had a very grand ^
effect by creating in a moment cataracts of
mud of various sizes from every peak and cliff,
which poured their united flood over the plain ^
in every direction. v
About a quarter of a mile from Canaan the
progress of the cars were immediately arrested t
by the avalanche of sand which was swept t
with resistless force across the track, fairly t
imbedding ihe engine, and obliterating all ap- n
jMi ance oi a rarrroaa. it was some hours
ifter the stoppage before sufficient force could v

Discovery of Mummies at Durango, Mexico. {
?A million of Mummies, it is stated have late- j
ly been discovered in the environs of Durango, ,
in Mexico. They are in a sitting posture, but
have the same wrappings, bands and orna- j
ments, of the Egyptian. Among them was ]
found a poinard of flint, with a sculptured han- j
die, chaplets, necklaces, &c., of alternately
hpftds. fragments of bones polished j
w,v'"- a
like ivory, fine worked elastic tissues, (proba. 1
bly our modern India rubber cloth) moccasins |
worked liko those of our Indians to day, bones
of vipers, &c. It remains to continue these '
interesting researches, and America will be- J
come another Egypt to antiquarians, and her
ruins will go back to the oldest periods of the '
world, showing doubtless that the ancestors of
the Mozteuzmas lived on the Nile; and that
their luxurious civilization was broken up and
overpowered by the hardy hordes of Asiatic
Tartars, who came down from Behrwg's
Straits and the Rocky Mountains. The scenes
of AtiUa and Alaric in Rome and Greece were
rehearsed at an earlier day on the shores of
Cal fornia and the plains of Mexico. It is unknown
of the mummies abov? mentioned, what
kind of embalmment was used, or whether it
was nitrous depositions in the caves where
they were found. A fact of importance is
stated, that the shells of the necklaces are of
a marine shell found at Zacatecas, on the Pacific,
where the Columbus of their forefathers
probably tnerefore landed from the Malay,
Hindostan or Chinese coast, or from islands of
the Indian ocean.
FAMINE IN INDIA.
It appears from the recent transactions of
the British India Society, that within the last
seventy-three years no less than sixteen desolating
famines have occurred, and that, too,
in a country the soil of which is allowed to bo
one of unexampled fertility, and the resources i

| aged, would be fully adequate to all the demands
of its teeming millions. The dates at
which these famines are said to have occured
are. 1766,1776, 1762,1792,1803,1804, 1819.
1820,1824,1829,1832,1833,1836,1837,1838,
and 1839. SSome of the earlier of these Amines
may, it is stated, be referred to the simultaneous
occurrence of wars; but with respect
to those of the last twenty years, which have
been a time of profound peace, no such cause
can be assigned. The accounts whieh are given j
of the famine of 1838 are appaling in the ex- |
treme. At Agra 79,OpO pining wretches were I
fed by the bounty of the public on the 14th
April; and between the 1st and 15th of March 1
71,534 infirm and sightless creatures were fed
in the 6ame manner. So great were the ravages
of death that the air for miles was tainted
with the effluvia from the putrifying carcasses
of men and cattle, and the rivers of the Jumma
and the Ganges were choaked up and poisoned
by the dead bodies thrown into their chan
nels. The water and fish of these rivers were
rejected as unfit for use. The mortality was
at the rate of 10,000 per month; a destruction
of life which, had it continued, would have
been sufficiently large to have swept off the
entire population in less than a year.

To Silk OulturistS)
AND TIIE
Friends of the Culture of the Mulberry,
AND SILK GENERALLY.
THE Journal of the American Silk Society
was established last January, for the purpose
of diffusing practical information through*
out our country, on tho subject of the culture of
Silk. It had been cloarly and conclusively
proved, that in every part of the Uniitd States,
silk might be profitably produced, and that ail
that was required to add this pr>o4 invaluable
article to the list of American staples, was a diffusion
of its practicability and profitableness,
together with such instruction in the art, as
would enable the people to produce it. For this
purpose this journal was estubii$hcd. It has now
been published 6even months, and we flatter
ourselves that it has done much towards accomplishing
the great object of its establishmeht. Buf
it has not done enough; its circulation is too
limited. Every friend to the Droductive interest
of his country should possess it. We therefore
call upou each individual who may be engaged
in raising mulberry trees, making silk, or who
is friendly to these objects, to subscribe to the
Journal, and especially do we call upon all who
are now subscribers, to exert their influence with
their friends and neighbors to induce them t~> be.
come subscribers, and thus extend a knowledge '
of the silk business into every neighborhood jn
cur extensive Union. Bearing in mind that the
proceeds of the publication are devoted to the
advancement of tho cause. Nothjpg is wanting
but this diffusion of knowhdge, to insure the
success of our present attempt to introduce the
culture of silk, as one of our great staples. The
Journal contains ample, plain and practical in.
structions in tho whoje art of silk making, and
all the back numbers can yet be supplied to new
subscribers. For greater convenience, back
numbers have been deposited with the following
gentlemen, who will act as agents, viz: G. R.
