which I have sworn " to protect, preserve,
and defend."
The usual opportunity which is afforded
tr. a Chief Magistrate ujwn his induction
to office of presenting to his countrymen
fin imposition of his policy which would
g ode his administration, in the form of
a.i inaugural address, not having, under
the peculiar circumstances which have
brought me to the discharge of the high duties
of President of the United States been
afforded to mc, a brief exposition of the
principles which will govern me in the
general course of mv administration of
public affairs would seem to be due as
well to myself as to you. In regard to
foreign nations, the groundwork of my
policy will be justice on our part to all,
ihmittiag to injustice from none. While
I shall sedulously cultivate the relations of
p jace and amity with one and all, :it will

the honor of the country shall suitain no
blemish, With a view to this, the cOidi'ti
?n of our military defences will become
n matter of anxious solicitude. The
Army, which has in other days covered
i'adf wirh renown, and the Navy not inappropriately
termed th, right arm of the
public defence, which has spread a light
glory over the American standard in
nil liie waters of the earth; should be -rendered
replete with efficiency.
In view of the fact, well avouched by
history, that the tendency of all human I
institutions is to concentrate power in the
hands of a single man, and that their ultimate,
downfall has proceeded fnm this cause, I
deeui it of th* most essential imjjortance that
a complete separation should take p ace be.
tw eo the tword and the purse. No matter
where or how the public moneys shall be deposited,
*o long as the President can exert
the power of appointing and removing, at hi*
pleasure, the agon's eel-ctcd for theii custody,
the Comm mder-in.chief of the Ariny and!

ng. Such increase is destined to keep
pace with the growth of our population, until

iflders u?ay be spread over the land. The
unrestrained power exerted by a sel idhly ambitious
man, in order either to perpetuate his
autlioriiyor to hand itover to mmo favorite
as Ins successor, may lead to the employment
of all tiie means within his control to accomplish
his object. The nght to remove from
office, while subjected to no just restraint, is
inevitably destined to |prodtice a spirit of
crouching servility with the offic al corps,
which, in order to uphold the hand which
feeds them, would lead to direct and active
interference in the elections, both'SVate and
Federal, thereby subjecting the course of
State Ngislation to the dictation of the Chief
Evecutive Otfi-er, and making the will of th .t
officer absolute and supreme. I wi I, at a
prn|)^r lliiiv, vnvuKi. tW s^tior of Ciin^rpfis
upon this subject, and sha.'l readily acquiesce
in the adoption of all proper measures which
are calculated to arrest these evils, so full of
danger in their tendency. I w ill remove no

Numerous removal* mav become necessary
under this rule. These wdl be made
by me 4 thrungli no acerbity of feeling.
I have had no cause to cherish or in.iu'ge unkind
feelings towards any. but my conduct will
lie regulated by a profound sense of what is
due to thecoun'ry and its institutions; nor
shall! neglect to apply the same unbending
rule to those of my own appointment. Freedom
of opinion will be tolen.ted, the full enjoy.
men? of the right of suffrage wi.J be maintained
as the bir hright ofevery Ag&erican, but I say
emphatically to the official corps, * thus far
and no further." i have dwelt the longer
upon this i-ubject, because removals from
office are likely often to arise, and I would
have n?y countrymen to understand the priori'
1< of the Executive action.
In ajj public expenditures the most rigid
economy should he resorted to, and, as one
of its results, a public debt in time of peace
oe sedulously avoided. A wise and patriotic
constituency will never object to the imposi
i?j __. r_'_ .u,i, .
ton or necessary uurucue n?> un.-im cm?> ,
and true wisdom dictates the resort to such
moan*, in order to supply deficiencies in the
revenue, rather than to those dnub'ftil expedient*,
which, ultimaling in a public debt, serve
to emiiarras the resources of thecnun'ry and
to lessen its ability to in et any great emergency
which may arise. Alisinecu es should
he ahull-lied. The appropriations should be
direct and explicit, sons to leave as limited a
*haie of discretion to the disbursing agents as
may be found compatible with the public; service.
A strict responsibility on the part of all
the agent* of the Government should be maintained,
and peculation or defalcation visited
with immediate expulsion from office and the
most condign punishment.
The public interest also demands that, if
?ny war has existed between the Government
and the cu rency, it 6hall reuse. Measures
of a financial character, now having the
sanction of legal erurtinen', shall he faithfully
enforced until repealed by the legislative autliontv.
liut I owe it to myself to dec-are
that I regard existing enactments as unwise
and impo'itic, and in a high degree oppressive.
I shall pmrnptly give my sanction to any con
s'iluiional measure; which originating in Csn
gresr, shall have for its object the restoration
of a sound circulating uiedirm, so essentially
necessary to give confidence in all the transactions
ofiife, to secure to industry its just
snd adequate rewards, and to reestablish the
public prosperity. In deciding upon the ad
aptalion of any such measure to the end proposed,
as well as its conformity to the Cons'itu>inn.
f shall resort to the Fathers of the great
Republican school for advice and instruction,
to be drawn from their sage views of our sys1'
in of Government, and the I'ght of tl.eir ever
glorious exampl \

and th?? States com|H)sir?g tie* Union.
The observance of these rule# is enjoined upon
us by that feeling of reverence and aff cri??n
which finds a place in the he rt of every pat*

which would inevitably end in a bloody sceptre
and an iron crown
In conclusion, I beg you to be assured that

THE FUNERAL CEREMONIES.
- Wednesday having been set apart for
the solemnities ofihe Funeral of th j late
President, some anxiety was felt, in the
early part of *he morning, as to the wrath,
er, for the sky was overcast, and fears
were entertained lest it should come on
to rain: but as the day advanced thes"
apprehensions, were dissipated* and,
though it continued rather cool, this did
but favor the march of the troops and of
the other numerous collections of persons
who formed portions of the Funeral Pry.
cession.
At sunrise, the sound of cannon from
the scv; r.il military stations in the vicinity
of the city heralded the melancholy
occasion w'-iich-was to assemble the citizens
of the District and its neighborhood,
and minute guns were fired during the
- ?:*u
morning, In entire con.son.nnc; ?mn
those mournful sounds was the aspect of
the whole City, as well its dwellings as
its population. The buildings o<n each
side of the entire length of the Pe insyl.
vania avenue, with scarcely an excep.
tion, and many houses on the contiguous
s'reels, were hung with festoons and
streamers of black, not only about the
signs and entrances, but in many cases j
from all the upperstories. Almost every
private dwelling had crape upon tin j
knocker and bell-handle of its door, and
many of the very humblest abodes hung
out soine spontaneous signal of the general
sorrow. The stores, and plac a of
business, even such as are too frequently
seen open on the Sabl>ath, were all closed,
fivery thing like business seemed to have
been forgolteurand all,minds to be occu
pied with the purpose of the day.
The railroad cars approaching 'he c?tv
? ? - _ni u ill,, 1
were conducted in presence of me rresi- ^
dent of the United States and Ex-President
Adams, the members of the late a id ^
present Cabinets, the Foreign Mini>te s 1
and the mourning household, by the Rev. m
Mr, Hawley. The Reverend gentleman
declined making any address upon the a'
occasion, but, pointing to a Bible and di
episcopal prnyer-book which lay upon the tli
table, stated that they had been purchased 01
by the deceased President immediately
after his arrival in the city, and had been
in daily use by him since then; that the
late President had declared to him, Mr. m
Hawley, personally his full belief in the P'
truth of the Christian Religion, and his &<
purpose, had not disease intervened to 01
prevent it, to have united himself to the ri
Church on the succeeding Sabbath. di

reached the Capitol Square, passing on the
South side of it, the Procession ad- '

reached the space in front of the Con- ?l
^ressiona! Burying Ground. Here the a
Car halted, while the line was formed by hi
the Military as they arrived, and then 9'
passed slowly on, being saluted at it pass- S
ed with colors lowered, the troops present. r<
ing a ms. and the officers saluting it in
military form. Having reached the prin- Vl
eipal entrance, the Car was again halted; ^
he coffin was taken down and placed on 8
1 he shoulders of the bearers; the Clergy 'e
advanced, and the Rev. Mr. Hawley, reeling
the solemn funeral service of the
Rpiscopal Li nrgy, the Procession advane
ddown the principal avenue of the
Cemetery until it reached the receiving 8<
vault, wi.ee a space had been kept open w
hy sentries under arms, and where a hoi- di
low square being formed, the coffin was ft
lowered into the vault. A signal being f1
g ven to the troops outside, the battalion 11
ot' Light Artillery, who were placed on an *
adjoining eminence, fired a salute, which v
was immediately followed bv the several
military foodies in line, who commenced'
firing from the left to the right, and continned
the salute till it bad thrice gone up t<
the whole line. * a

and returned ^by thfo same -route to^fte* ^
city, where the trfoopl frete thffnl&tJdjItod4 ?
1 Tiie civic part of the Procession was tl
not less striking than the military. It B
embrucod the municipal officers of the ei
District, the Clergy of all denominations, i*
the Judiciary, the Executive officers of g
the Government, including the President vv
of the United States and the /f-iads of a
Departments, the ex-members of the late a
Cabinet now in the city, the Comptrol.
lers, Auditors, and Commissioners, Treas.
urcr, Register, &c. with a numerous
column of clerks in the several departments.
Such members of both Houses of rj
J Congress as are in the city also attended, 0
and Ex President Adams in his place.? 3
Next followed Officers and Soldiers who
had served under General H irrison in 3
the late war. Another division of the
Profession consisted of public Societies J
and Associations, preceded by theis ban,iers,
and wearing their respective badges 3
| ?among whom we noticed the Society 3
, f OJd-Fellows, very richly attired, the
Washington Catholic Temperance Asso- J
ciation, with their white banner displaying
the Cross which is the symbol of their
fiith, the Typographical Society, several J
Schools and Lyceums, and, to chse ail,
the different Fire Companies of the Dis- \

The music wris excellent; several fine
bands playing mournful airs, giving place,
from time to tirn*, to the muffled drums (j
of the military, beatingslow marches^ ^
But the object of chief interest, and
one which, as it passed, hushed every oth- J
cr sound, and caused many a tear to fall,
was \
TJIF. TTVETtAL TAR. !V
containing the body of the deceased Pres. \
ident. It was of large dimensions, in
form an oblong platform, on which was
a raised dais, the whole covered with H
black vwlvct. From the cornice of the p
platform fell a black volvet curtain out- h
side of the wheels to within a few inches
of the ground. From the corners of the C(
car a black crape festoon was formed on ?
all sides, looped in the centre by a funeral
wreath. On the coffin lav the Sword j
of Justice and the Sword of Sfate, surmounted
by the scroll of the Constitu- y
lion, hound together by a funeral wreath
form d of the yew and the cypress. The
Carwas drawn by six white horses, hav.
ing at the head of each a colored groom,
dressed in white, with white turban and
sash, and supported by pall-bearcrs in p
black. The effect wns very fine. The
* i - ? i i.. _r ^
contrast or tn:s siowiy moving way wi |;
' white and black, so opposite to the strong
colors of the military around it, struck
she eye even from the greatest distance,
ind gave a chilling warning beforehand
that the corpse was driiwing nigh.
Tue entire Procession occupied two full
mites in length, and was marshalled on it
its way by officers on horseback carrying tt
white batons with black tassels. The j8
utmost order prevailed throughout; and, jr
considering the v;ry great concourse of ^
people collected, the silence preserved tl
during the whole course of the march was tt
very impressive. c,

Prospective Value of Cotton.?
le early part of the season, the prevaili
pinion was, that the Cotton crop for 18
nd 1841, would not exceed 1,780,0
ales, and on that basis purchases 1
lipment and on speculation, were mat
ometime afterwards, the estimates w<
)duced to 1,600,000, and some of th(
>wer, and in consequence, prices t
anced somewhat on the early purchase
Pithin a few days, the estimates from t
outh place the product at 1,850,000 I
;s.
If the crop should prove equal to thz
lere will be an increased stock at t
nd of the year in Europe, and as plai
ig is now on the scale to yield in a gc
>ason 2,100,000 to 2,200,000 bal
hich is but 22,000 bales above the p
4 1
net of last season, there is reason to 10
>rward to a decline in the prices of t!
taple, and the more so, as the last pri<
i Mobile and New-Orleans are beyo
rhat the March quotations in Liverp
rill fairly warrant.
There is another consideration beari
n the prospective value of this sta{
amely, the prospect of a continued
cfruption to the trade between In
nd Chma, which will haye the eff
f increasing the export of this staple fr
ndia-to England. The usuiM quant

(S. 000 to 200,000 bales. Now, If only a por- p
ut tion of this should go to England,"in addi- c
n- tion to what would, under ordinary cir- 1
>er cumstanccs go there, it will swell the al- ?
nd ready too heavy stock and cause a glut \
ert of the article; and lower its value below i
int even existing low prices. i
Notwithstanding a Very great increase I
in the consumption of cotton, the stock i
in England has increased on last year's i
by 228,500 bags. The whole in hand of
dealers and spiners, is estimated n it 207. I
ar- 000,000 pounds, against 126,000.000
ay pounds last year. In the ports, the stock
stands at 464,000 againts 265,003 bales j
id- 'ast year.
From the Continent, no accurate returns <
a have been made, save France, but the increased
stock may be put down about
g 90,000 bales, which would make an in^
crease in Europe of 289 000 bales.

H o:\oLFir, Dec. 5.?The Exploring
Squadjon h ?* n? w le't our harbor tocru e
it various directions. The To pose his
sailed (so it is said) for the southern gr
ups, to return here in four months.
The Peacock and Flying Fish to Ascension,
King's Mill Group and the Caroline.
Archipelago, thence to the Columbia Ri
vcr, in spring, when a store-ship will sail
from here for that place, with all n' ccasary
supplies, which will probably obviate the
necessity of their returning here. The
Viucnnes has gone to Hawaii, for the
purposes of making a thorough survey of
the volcano, and Manun Loa, and all the
in er sting points in that vicinity. She
will also go to the Columbia in a few
months.
Much has been dure during the stay of
the Squadron, and we have not a doubt
hut that the history of the Expedition will
give the most faithful account of the Islands
which has ever appeared, particularly
in all departments of science. The
artis s, too, have been busy, and hare
taken m my views ofscenery, costume*,
in I the portraits of chiefs and common
people. The salt lake at. E wn, which has.
heretofore been supposed to be connected
with the sea, and affected by tides, and
the s ilt the product of evaporation, has
l>ecn ascartained to be of mineral formation,
and disconnected with the ocean.
Salt is found 180 feet above the surface of
the l?kj. Its dep'h, which was considered
fathim'css (and rightly so) proved to
he si\teen inches.
The harbor at Ewa, or Pearl River,
was surveyed and found commodiuiis for
shipping, with a good entrance between
the ree's, with twenty three of water up.
on ti e bar. Honolulu harbor and adja. ^
cent reefs were also thoroughly surveyed.
Ast on mica!, meteorological, and mag.
netic ohsen*ations and experiments have
been daily and nightly made at the oh.
<crva'ory, with all the instnimcnts witli
which the Expedition is most liberally
provided. The pendulum for detennin.
ng the figure of the earth, is the first that
nas ever been carried on a voyage of this
nature, and promises the most interesting
esults. In many other respects the stay
nf the squadron has been most beneficial
to the Elands.
Business hns revived, and much money
distributed among the natives. The im*
session mated on the minds of the chiefs
by the dep< rtment of the officers, is of the
most favorable rature, and will add much
to the already high n putat'o 1 gain :d by A
merican officers for their government and
country. It is needless to speak of the
unmingled satisfaction and pleasure which
t ie vbit has produced among the residents.
The sorrow manifested at their departure
8 the best evidence of this.

CORRESPONDENCE OF THE
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE.
New York, April 8.
The Acadia reached Boston yesterday
morning at eigh o'clock, and her newse
here this morning at six o'clock. 4
Though nine days later, The
news is not important. The Columbia
iteamer had arrived out, and carried out '
intelligence which was considered as at
east more pacific than had been taken
>ut before. Four ships of war were fitting
out with all possible despatch?two at
Sheerness and two at Portsmouth. In ^
addition to this, I read in one of the Loi.
Jon papers that six|re^iments had rece'v< d
orders t > I e i i readint ss to embark for
North America.
The spare of time which had elapsed
between the 10th and 19th of March had
materially cooled the arder of the En.
glish hot-heads, and the men, whoe*
b'o )d was not so warm, and who are
composed of the conservative part)', which
controls events in England, speak *s .
sensible and patriotic men speak here of
the horrors of war. The peace men are as * 9
