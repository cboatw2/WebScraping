The loss of life in this exploit is said not n
^to have been great the Chinese having hid C
ample time to save themselves by flight j|
before the vessel blew up. We arc sorrv S)
to have to record one casualty on board a

Captain Hall, was severely wounded in
the hand by the bursting of a rocket. ^
During the action at Shaming, the rig.

deal cut up and three men wounded; we
have not heard of any casaulties on board a
the other two ships. After the destruction t

On the 23i, the whole forces, naval and w

rived to wnhin four or five miles of Can- ^
ton; and even H. M. ships Blenheim had ?
been ajjle in spile of her great draught of ^

ny Chinese chop-boats were seized at
Whampoa by the British, and they aflor- 1
ded excellent canveyance for the troops. *

from thence a rnob of soldiers and thieves s

sacked; every thing, even to the window
frames, has been carried away, and a v
large quantity of merchandise chiefly wollens,
which were stored in the Company's
/ Godowns, liavo become a prey to thiutoh.
On the 25lh the Cameronians were still
in possession of the factories, and the oth^

altogether 1706 men and 500 marlines. *

session of the heights to the north of Can- ;
ton, and driven ail the Tartar troops into
the city, which was bombarded from the (
bhrps with round shot, shells, and rock- a
ets. 1 a
O.i the 26th a general attack, it is said L
was contemplated and parties who arrived
yesterday from VVharnpoa, which they j
left late on that day, report having heard
a heavy canonade during a greater pait
of the day. It is therefore very probable n
that whilst we are writing Canton is I"
in possession of the English.
v We hear that, on the 25th, early in ( *
the morning, Howqua and the Kwang- '
chowtoo had an interview wiih one of the a
naval commanders, ofFi.ring to negotiate f
for the saving of the city; that they offer- c
. ed five millions of dollars, to he paid with- c
'in three months, and all damage done to, 0
dp suffered by, the British during the at- ^
tack on trie city to be made good; that they
further withdraw all troops from Canton, a
. ?ivt dkL' for 40 davs to aff'prt it in. Thp.?o
J
' hffers, if made, have, it appears, been re- i
? fused. It would indeed, be the height of1 a
folly n??w again to enter into negotiation ''
with the Chinese after the ample experi- i
en e we have had of their total wantjc
?. od faith. Tuey probilly by these a

future moment a ?am treacherously to , i<
break taeir promises when- vr-r they Jnav I a

some advantage. a
The number of the rafts prepared hv c
the Chinese must have been enormou.se; 1
they have been seen on all parts of the j j
^ river between Canton and the Bogue.?
Some were sent down upon the Wellesly ,j
(anchored oiFlne Bogue) from Chimnpee;
others at Second Bar, upon the Futlay
Sslam (ashore there) and the Scaleby a
Castle; and the naval Senior Commander P
ha?, we hear, issued a notice to the Chi-j?
nese that any viliage Ironi which a tire P

nearest to the spot whence the fire craft s
shall have been sent, is to be destrayed, so 5

In prosecution of this threat, the Sill- I (|
phur and Alligator .have completely de- v
stroved a village near Hall" Way Pagoda, J,
whence tire rafts had been sent among v
the British shipping; and it is to be
hoped that this severe example will have | f
the desired effect. H. M. Plenipotentia. S(
ry has also issued a proclamation to the I 0
people of Canton, saying that, having on ; t
several occasions heen treacherously dealt
with by the Emperor's Commissioners, i (;
he now intends to drive them and their i (
troops out of Canton, and warns peaceful . p
inhabitants to leave the town without , {
delay, in order not to he made to suffer for
the faults of their mandarins. v

in the same manner as the others. j.
On Friday, the 21st instant, all foreign g
ers left Canton, pursuant to the above t1
notice of Captain Elliot, and went to t,
Whampoa or retired on hoard boats in the ;l
river, with the exception of Mr. Coolidge
and Mr Morse, two American merchants. s
Immediately on the factories being thus
abandoned, the mob broke in, and were
with great difficulty, driven by the soldie- e
rv, who wanted no share in the plunder, f'
The above named gentlemen were in e
great danger of violence from the mob v

icar the French Folly, fired upon by the
Chinese, and, trying to escape by seeking
shelter on board a tea-boat on the
outhcrn bank of the river, the passeners
and crew were followed by the soliers,
who very severely maltreated them,
rounding most of them, and then carried
tiem prisoners to the authorities at Canin.
We omitted tostate in the foregoing
ccount of the hostilities at Canton, that
I. B. M. Algerine, after the forces had
rrivedat Canton, was placed opposite
lie Dutch Follv, which the Chinese had
trongly fortified, and from whence a fire
ms soon opened upon tiie vessel, which
ras returned with interest ; the Chinese,
owever, defended the place with great
etermination, but it was at last carried.
Ve regret, however, to learn that the
}ss in killed and wounded of the Algerine,
as been vary severe, particularly among
lie boat parties that were sent to carry
he fort and several other masked batteies.
A lieutenant of the ship, whose
lame we did not learn, had, it is reported
lis leg carried olF by a cannon shot.?
The guns found in the fort were very

Etxract of a letter, dated

Mess-s. Cary & Co.: Since the date of
air general advices events of much imlortance
have transpired, a hriof note of
vhieh may not he uninteresting to you.
The excitement among the Chinese
eferred to, continued to increase until
he I3th instant. When Captain Elliot
rrived at Canton, it soon become known
hat he had already ordered the whole
Jritish force, vessels of war. transports,
ind troops, to the immediate vicinity ot
Janton ; and his advice to his countrvnen
was to close their business and pre>are
for removal with as little delay as
>ossible. Up to the 20th instant, the
Chinese authorities had avoided holding
iny communication with Captain Elliot,
ind matters wore a very dubious and
insatisfactory aspect.
The local authorities, however, pub.
ished proclamations and sent messages
" " l . 1

issuringail resident foreigners of their
o O
>erfect safety in Canton.
On the evening of the 20th, all the
English residents had embarked, and only
our or five Americans, confiding in the
insurance *fthe Chinese, remained in the
actories; the same night the Chinese
:ommenced hostilities by sending a fleet
if fire boats and rafts against the vessels
if war lying near the city, but without
loing them any damage.
Tfiis act was avenged by the Pylades
nd sfearner Nemesis, that attacked and
estroyed a battery near the factories and
bout forty fire boats and as many fire
afts.
On the morning of the 22d an Amerian
resident was seized by the Chinese
nd taken from his factory; at the same
ine that a boat, belonging to the Amer:an
ship Morrison, with three passengers
nd seven seamen were captured soon
fter leaving the factory for Whampoa,
nd the party carried prisoners into the
ity.
From tliis the fime was occupied by the
English in concetitrati g their forces
icar the city, until the 24ili at 4 P. M.
^he Hyacinth 18. Mudeste 18, Pylades
S, Nirnrod 18, Columbus 16, Cruiser 16,
nd Aigerine 10, having taken up their
osition in front of the city and suburbs,
pened their fire upon every offensive
omt of the Chinese, who returned it
rith considerable spirit at first, but were
non compelled to desert their guns. At
P. M. a body of.soldiers, about 400,
.ere landed at the foreign factories, in
he vicinity of which the Americans,
fho had been taken prisoners two days
efore and examined by the authorities,
ere released.
The firing was continued until about 9
\ VI., when the suburbs were on fire iri
everal places, and nearly all the batteries
n shore in possession of or destroyed by
ho English.
While this was going on in front of
Canton, (ion. Gough was ^landing his
roops, 1300 nn;n, at the foot of t'.e
icights, in the rear of the city, and on
he morning of the 25th he commenced
iterations. Particular's of the day's
rork are not yet known, further than
hat, with a loss of some 40 killed and
rounded, four batteries were taken from
he Chinese, and great numbers of their
flicers and soldiers killed, the heights
ommanding the city taken, and the
British forces entrenched upon them.
The loss of the Chinese on this occasion
s variously estimated at from 3,000 to
i,()00, and even as high as 10,000 men;
;nd they now find, to their cost and o.\reme
disappointment, that they are unb!e
to cope wilh European troops on
hore, as they have before proved themelves
in their encounters with British
urces afloat.
On the 20th the vessels of war were
n<r:?rrc?rl in nninfiruT ninl destroying the
? n i o .
ew remains of opposition, and in the
ivening mandarins railed on the Captain
nth tings of trace, to negotiate for the
r* c
reservation of the city.
O "r advices from the seat of action
nd negotiation are to the morning of
he 27th, when it was said the Chinese
ad capitulated, and offered a large sum
f money for the ransom of the city, which
I was supposed, would then he saved.
It is scarcely necessary for us!to say that
incethe 11th nothing has been done in the
way of sales of imports, and that all shipments
of teas, &c., cease on the 2ist;
our establishment, in common with all
others, is again removed to Macao, iind
we fear with a prospect of being obliged
to remain here for several months, inasmuch
as, in the event of a suspension of
hostilities, and Canton being left without
further injury, we do not think the British
merchants will trust themselves there
while the British forces are drawn off to
the northward. We think it will be
iound necessary to renew the blockade
of the port; and the most that we can
hope^for under almost any circumstances
is, that neutrals may proceed to Canton
- -
I to realize the foreign merchandise depos-1
! ited there, arid to complete the lading of the
ships a ready in port.
VVe are without late intelligence fram In?dia,
but Commodore Bremer is daily expected
on in the steamer Queen, to resume command
of the naval forces ; and it is understood that
a reinforcement of eight regiments, about
6,500 men, is now on the way to Chi:ia from
India.
VVe enclose a report of the cargo of the
Narragansett, by which you will see tiat the ;
total export since 1st of July of last year is j
only PO.OOOchesis. VVe doubt if tho lading
of the American ships at VVhampoa will be j
completed without much delay ; and, viewing ,
thestat^and prospect of foreign relations)
with China in whatever light we may, still we j
look upon it as almost certain that high prices
for teas will and must rule in Europe and Ainerica
during the ensuing year or two.

Macao May 31,1341. '
My last was per the LoweJl 16th instant.
; since when hosti itieshave recommended, and,
| as you see from the heading, we are all again
I at Macao, too happy to have escaped with our
lives. Trade had been going on quietly e~
nough till within a lew days before the outbreak
when it became crident, from various
infringements on the pari of the Chinese of
the truce, that there was to be another battle,
i large masses of soldiers from the interior be:
ing collected in and about the city, to the
; number, it is said, of 50,000; and Captain
j Elliot's circular, issued on the 21st, recotnj
mending all foreigners to leave Canton immej
diately, left no doubt about it and we ail hurI
ried oif instantly ; so suddenly, indeed, that
i severalofmy trunks, fall ofclothes, &c. were
I 111 It behind, and havesir.ce been taken off by
the Cuinsse mob that broke into the factories
immediately on our departure, and rifled every
thing they could lay hands on. This, however,
was my only loss on the occasion, as my
accounts and a.l valunbie papers are fortunately
preserved Many others have been serious
losers by the suddenness with which
they wese obliged to escape, to say nothing of
the immense amount of property and goods
in the factories and hongs, much of which will
doubtless be lost to the owners until they can
compel the Chinese Government to indemnify
them. You will sec all the particulars in the
newspapers of course, and I need not therefore
revert to them. Had we remained a
single hour longer in the place there is no
telling what might have been the consequence '
a9 the moment the guard of marines was |
withdrawn the work of destruction commenced. 1
j This is the second narrow escape I have had ,
from Canton, and, I assure you, I have had
quite enough of it. A few hours after the foreigr.ers
were out the attack commenced, and i
cannonading and burning were the order of |
the day. Canton is not yet destroyed, but!
military possession was taken of the heights I
i and suburbs by the British forces on the 26th, I
and thevT certainly would have bombarded !

offered to ramsom it at eight millions
of dollars, payable in eight successive days.
Although we have nothing official on the subject,
such is believed to be the result of the
negotiation of the last few days. Many thousand
Chinese, have been killed, and there ia
some loss on the Bnt'shside, but not of much
consequence. Part of the suburbs have been
burm, and the whole city was near sharing
the same fate. We have a report to day that
the ti:st instalment of one million has been j
paid, and Canton will thus escape destruc- j
tiop.. Thus the Chinese have drawn upon j
upon themselves at last signal punishment for j
their breach o fgood faith. They have had j
a second lesson, not to be easily forgotten. I

Emperor's orders were positive that no terms
should be made, and it was supposed that,
with their numerical superiority, they wouid
have made better resistence ; but it is now
clear thai their numbers avail but little when
opposed to Eu-opean skill and courage, The
British steamers and ships got up very near
the citv, and fired with destructive effect;
the Chinese must be convinced that they can.
not s:and, although in some places they made
a desperate resistence.
Many of the factories are desiroyeo'; and if
I rvor the plice is occupied again as a seat of
j trade; they w ill have toerect newoies. The
| impression is now gaining ground that [long
i Kong will be the place of business, and that
i it will be built up during the summer. Still
I am inclined to think that Ca ntun w ill retain i
a share of the trade, and should not be much j
surprised if we were back there again ere ;
long, carrvmg on trade as usual. The latest j
account we have is, that the forces intend
proceeding up the river to Foshan, a city to
large size about twenty miles above Canton,
and there make similar denionstratiois, after
which they will probably proceed along the
coast, attacking the various cities, ai tl finally
bring up at Pekin. All this is onlv incase!

matters are not previously settled here, of,

than at any former peri >d ; and it is not iin-1 .
probable we may 6oon have the traje open!
again, although in the mean time a nufficient'1
quantity of tea has gone forward both to England
and America, and before that is exliaus- i
