A PROCLAMATION.
We find the following in a late number
of the Detroit Alvertiser. It is a curiosity
in its way.
Patriot Proclamation to the Indians!
The Provisional. Government of Upper
Canada take the earliest opportunity of
cautioning the INDIANS agriust taking
party with their swindling oppressors, the
enemies. of Liberty, against ihe Patriots of
Upper Canada and assuring them that if
they do not take part with their oppressors,
the loyalists, during the struggle of the Pa
triots for their independence, they shall
'iave their lands secured to them, and their
civil and religious rights respected:
The Provisional Government of Upper
Canada also promise all Indians who join
their Standard, and nid them in obtaining
their Independence, the same wages, ra
tions, and bounty,as are given to white men,
that is, 12 dollars a month, and rations, one
hundred dollars bounty money in June next,

MUSICAL Exiiumo.-We had the pleasure
of attending the exhibition of Mr. Bacon's Mu
sical Class on Friday evening last. The perfor
niance of the young ladies, was, in the general,
highly creditable to them, and to Mr. B. If we
may be permitted, fora moment only, to play the
critic, we will say, that as much as we love that
retiring mode.-ty for which the truly virtuous and
well-bred female is distinguished, there is such a
thing, we think, as sometimes touching too gently
the strings of the guitar, or the keys of the piano,
and injuring :a good voice by not singing loud
enough to be heard with anydistinctness.
The guitar is an instrument well adapted forr
the display-of the graces, and while we cordially
deprecate those convulsive motions which may
be called the jerks, we like to see a young lady
show motion enough to distinguish her from a
liteless statue.
But let it not be thought that we are displeased.
We repeat that they deserve praise, and the
more so, as the period of instruction with most
of them has been very short.
W1ewish that occasions of this kind woutld oc
cur more often nmong us; and the large cogpa
ny which attended the recent exhibition, give an
earnest of~a similar desire on the part of the om.
munnity. We wish Mir. B. full success .in his
* vocation, (for which we know he possesses high
gualifications,) and the young ladies a rapid pro
gress in that pleasing art, which, it has been said,
often speaks to the soul a language richer in
meaning than words, and which none can deny
but he who has not heard its sub~limest strains,
<,r has not the capacity to appreciate them.
We are requlested to give public notice that
the Upper Battallion of the 10th Regiment of
South Curolina Militia, (Col. Husiet'.s) will pa
rade at Clark's (formerly Christie's) on the last
Saturday in April, the 28th; that the Lower
- Battalion will parade at Mt. Willing on the 1st
Saturday in May, the 5th. The comimissioned
anid non-commnissioned officers will parade the
day previous for drill and instruction.
TEXAs AND ARKNsAs.-A difficulty has
arisen between these States, in relation to
their boundary. Texas claims Miller andi
Fayette counties in Arkansas. and haes es
tablished land offices there. The majority
of the people are on the side of Texas, and
have reno~unced the jurisdiction of Arkan
bas. The Governor has submitted the
matter to the Legislature.
The new Hotel an Charleston being near
ly completed, the proprietors, a few days
since, gnve a splendid entertainment, at
which Col. Small, the architect, and Mr.
Page, the lesaee, received their full share of
praise andI honor. -Feeling as we do a live.
.ly interest for the growing success and pros.
perity of Charleston, wre are pleased at
every new evidence of the enterp'ize of her
citizens. It was said on the occasion to
which we are alluding, "that the first Page
in the history of the Hontel promises a vt
'ttmc of good things." We trtust, at no dii.
tant day, to come in for our portion of the
volume.
CoNonEss.-The Sub-Treasury Bill has
passed the Senate by an amendment which
changes its whol, character. We look
uiponi the result as a defeat of the measure.
- Thle 2ad section~ihe hardrnoneyaection, was
stricken out on motion of Mr. Cuthhbert ol
*Georgia. An amnendment from Mr, Web
ster was adopted, thie effect of which w as to
do away the specie circular, by making nc
received for public lands and custom house
dues. After the rejection uf amendments
from Messrs. Benton, Tipton and others,
the question was taken upon the third
reading of the bill and decided as follows:
Yeas-Messrs. Allen, Burton. Brown,
Clay, of Ala., Cuthbert, Fulton, Hubbard,
King, Lion, Lumpkin, Lyon, Morris, Mou

and White-25.
As soon as the Vice President declared
the vote, the Senate adjourned.
Mr. Calhoun, it will be observed, voted
against the bill, it being, as he declared,
with its amendment, as objectionable as the
Pot Bank system.

From the Prontier.-We received on Sat
urday, the British official account of their
attack on the horde wvhich imnvaded Point
Pelle Island, but hail no room then to place
it i our columns. It appears that Coftbnel
Mathland, time British officer commanding
on the Canada shore, after ascertaining
that the ice was sufficiently strong. p~assedl
over it a detatchment of regtular troops amnd
militia, two compaines of which he ordered
to thme south side of the Island to intercept
the retreat of the invaders to the American
shore, whilst he himself lauded on the norih
side and (drove them before him. Finding
themselves hemmed in, they attempted to
escape on the south side, and here encoun
tered the two comipanmies posted there. An
engagement ensued, in which the invaders
were routed and left a Col. Bradled, a M ajor
Handley, and Captains Van Reusslacr arrd
Meceon, and seven others, dead on the
field, several besides taken prisoners, many
of whom were severely woutndod. The
British loss is said to be two killed and twenty
eight severely wounded
A New ERA ta S-rEAM.--Extract of a
letter to Messrs Wadsworth and Smith,
from the Secretary of the British amid
American Steam Navigation Company of
London.
LoN non, Feb. 22.
I have the pleasure to inform yon that
the Sirius. steanibont of 700 tons anid 32(0
hmorse power, has been chartened by several
oif the Directors, of the British & Amxericani
Steam Navigatiomn Company and some of
the Proprietors, for a voyage to New York
andt back. The "Sirius" is a new vessel,
about six months at wvork, during which
time she has proved herself superior to any
Steam vessel upon outr waiters, in speed
anti seaworthy qualities, and is a great fa
voriite in the station she is at present."
(Dr. Lardiner, anid many of our packet
ship Captains any "the thing can't be
navigation, there is no question, but that
we are behind the British, as much as we
are before them in river, lake, and all inte
rior navigation. If the Sirius can come out
here in March, and early in April, against
the strong Westerly winds usually prevail
ing, the thing can -be done. At any rate
the attempt is to be nade.-&press.
Mr. Clay, in his late speech says:--in
the sense which the Senator (Mr. Calhoun)
supposes Banks to conflict with the coining
power, foreign commerce, and especially,
our commerce with China, conflict with it
much more extensively. That asehe great
absorbentof the precious metals, it is there
fore, much more unconstitutional than the
State Banks. Foreign commerce sends
them out of the country; BanA retain them
toithin it."
Mr. Clay's inference, that the Banks re
tain the precious metals within the country,
while foreign commerce is their great ab
sorbent, is at war with facts. The Banks
by over issues of paper drive the precious
metals out of the country. They then be
come merchandize and constitute a part of
foreign commerce. The China trade has
occasionally produced a demand for these
metals; but that demand has ceased. Why
will not those who occupy distinguished
stations as Legislators, and who are looked
to as guides of public opiniop, be more ac
curate in their facts?-Charleston Patriot.
Van Rensellaer in Limbo.-Gen. Vab
Reusellera had his trial at Auburn, New
York, on the 7th inst. when the various
instances of his violationof the neutral laws
of the United States were fully established.
Declining to give bail he was sent to Albany
to jail, to take his trial there in June. Gen.
Sutherland was taken to Toronto on the
12th and his trial by court martial was to
commence on the 13th; but was subse
quently put off, until the arrival of the new
Governor SirGeorge Arthur.
Gen. Van Reusellaer is drawing up a full
statement of "movements, doings and so
on"-connected with his northern expedi
tion, which is to be laid before the puDlic.
Char. Cour.
AWFUL DIsPENsArTION.-On Wednes.
day last, while a cause was on trial in the
Superior Court of this county, one of the
Jurors, Richard Barber, fell forward in his
seat and almost instantly died. He had not
been in the least indisposed, that any of his
acquaintances know, and but a few ruo
meits before, on some question arising at
the Bar, as to the testimony of a particular
witness, had given his recollection of it.
Mr. Barber was a most pure and excellent
man in all his relations, and leaves a large
number of devoted friends to deplore his
loss.-Salisbury (N. C.) IVatchman.
We learn with deep regret the death of
Stephen D. Miller, Esq. formerly Governor
of this State, Senator in Congress. &c. He
died on the 8th Iinst. at Raymond, Missisippi.
South Carolina remembers him withbgrati

AUGUSTA AND HAMBURG MARKET.
CoTTO.-During the past % eek there
has been a better enquiry than has been
experienced in the market for several weeks
past, and the sales have been to a fair ex
tent, without any material change in prices.
The general opinion still is that the article
will go lower, and purchasers seem disposed
to hold off' a little longer. Our receipts are
on the increase, and our warehouses full.
We quote 7& a 9k-a lot of strictly prime,
in square bales, might bring 10 cents.

are taken by none of our banks, and are
selling at 10 per cent. discount; and the
Monroe Rail Road and Banking Company,
ditto, 1 per cent. discount. The bills of the
Ocmulgee Bank are received by only one
of our banks, the Mechanics, otn deposit
-and our Brokers charge I per cent, dis
count on them. The Post notes of the
banks of she interior payable in cur
