the bricks to dry and become a lit lo ha

feet long, as high as the hacks, and ma<
as hght as possible. The straw hurdles a
so useful, no brick maker should bcwitho
* them ; they afford shelter against both s*j
rain, and frost, (which are the greatest cn
inirs of the brickmaker in this singe of il

Bricks arc always ma le by piece wo

tag alt things in good order around him, w

in a day of fourteen hours work, or ubo
five hundred per hour; but to accompli:
this he w.ll require six hands to wait on hir
nit of winch are children. They supp
hitn with the tempered clay and sand, at
water to dip his touL into, remove the oriel
as fust as they a?e moulded, and return tl
turning boards.
When small quantities of bricks ore t
quired in a country where they cannot 1
obtained, or for particular jobs, the clay m;
be tempered and mixed by placing it on
hard bottom, and working it by a shovel <
spade with water, and trampling it in t!
manner already described for pudding i
stead uf waiting for a frost to break it dovv
Jn tin's case more water must be added tht
is fit for tempering brick earth, but it ct
be got rid of afterwards by draining itawa
or exposing the earlh !o dry ; when ti
moulding and drying must be conducted ;
above described, but on a smaller scale.
In the vicinity of London, where the d
mand for bricks is enormously great, tl
large brick makers adopt a different metht
to that above described for tempering at
preparing their clay, but there is no vari.
tiow in the manner of moulding and dryii
upon tiie bucks. The clay is dug in autun
and frosted as usual; but instead of heir
piled in ridges or small heaps, the whole
wheeled into one immense pile, as froit.i
the iuterior is of less importance when m
chinery is used. At the breaking up of (I
frost lite clay is carried in navigators' ba
rows toa mill cuiled a pug-mill, whore it
worked by horse power, and incorporab
with the necessary quantity of sand, chal
or other material, and water, which is off
pumped up and delivered into the mill, I
tiie same power, :n sucii quantity as will r
duet; lira whole earth to so thin a state th
it is just capable of running from anopenii
made ih the bottom of (he mill for its di
( Uurge. it is received upon a wire sieve
ivo | strainer, that stops all stones or foreign init's
i gradients, if their size would prove prejudifty
cial to the bricks about to be made. Two
he capacious ponds or reservoirs, about three
in or four feet deep, are formed for receiving
tat tins diluted car h, and they are so placed in
uk J respect to iheiudl, that its pjoduce can be
be discharged into either at pleasure, by means
ith | of wooden shoots or spoo's. The pugged
e- j stuff is conducted into one reservoir until it
Ids ! is quite filled, when it is lurued into the oth- r;
nd an I wh le :li?* second is filling, the earthy
lie matter subsides in the firs', leaving nothing
in but clear water ai ihe s irlace, and this carein
fully drawn ofTby w.thdrawiug peg*, that
un are placed very close, one below the other,
lie fi\?ni holes in a thick plank let in o the upp r
a part of the reservoir. In ih s way he waiv.
i ter is drained off and runs to waS'ej leaving
he I a finely divided and most equable mud in
or I the reservoir, which becomes of such conrd
! sistence by draining, that it can be taken up
an j by shovels, pir into barrows, and bo taken
in I away. , The discharge of the mill is tlun
nd again turned in o the first reservoir, which
re- fills, w'lil" a similar draining and removal of

;es j In this manner the clay is more rninu'tdy d ne

ig 27ih of December, 1839, viz. 1st. "Whin
ile would be the efTect upon the military ser

ks would be the probable annual charge upon

ve I have the honor to report that, upon an
r. examination of the probaolo ag? s of the
rk officers, there does not app- ar to be in the
v. whole Army more than eight who have
ill arrived at the ago of sixty, and few, if any
id of them, would bo willing to retire on half
ut pay, because the pay would be too small
- riv _
>1) to afford them a decent subsist nee. me
n, highest half poy would not probably exceed
ly thirty-seven and a half dollars a month, and
id the lowest twenty-five ; but let it be suppoks
sed that four, or one half-pay list, say two
ie colonels and two lieutenant colonels, the
expense a year for the two colonels would
e-1 be, at $37 50 a month each, $900 00
!>e j For the two lieutenant colonels,
iy I at $30 u month each, 7*20 00

ie Of the otHcers above sixty years of n?*e,
n- there are many of them hearty, hale and ef.
n. lective men, capable of rend* ri. g good s?-r- I
in vice, and now actively and usefully employin
cd.
v, As it is presumed that the object of th"
ie resolution is to allow officers who may
as conceive themselves unfit for the active
duties of the pro'es^ion to retire, and make
o. room for others more efficient in physical
ie I power, and at the same time to provide for
-L a -L- ? iioufe nf :iOTi? flij
jU SUCH Ullti'LTS auovir J>.um -b- ?
id mav be willing to retire*, I would r?specta
lully beg leave to suggest a plan of a more
igi extended nature, and on a more liberal
in ' scale of compensation, free from any exig
! pense or burden the Governm-nt, which,
is! besides having the advantage of economy
lg j would render the corps of officers quite (
a-1 effective, and consequently improve gr<a ly
he the condition of the whole service,
r. My plan is this : Let every officer who,
is from age, wounds, or other infirmities, shall
cd become unfit to perform the duties of his
Ik, office, be retired from service on his ordi
an nary pay, without rations, or other allowan.
by ces whatever; and let the officer next in the
c- line of promotion fill the place of such
mt retired officer, with the emoluments beiig
longing to that rank, and the pay of the
is- I commission from w hich he may be promoorited.
So that, if a colonel be retired, the
X' XX X*/ 1'X -? ?< _
?????? > \
lieutenant colonel, who, according to the
established rules of promotion, should receive
the vacant colonelcy, would bt* colonel
with the pay of lieutenant colonel, and
the emolument of a full colonel.?
Tnis promotion would vacate the lieutenant
colonelcy, which, in like manner, would he
filled by promotion of the major, who wou'd
enjoy the rank of li* u enant colonel, w t?
the pay of major and the emolument of
lieutenant colonel; so woul I tie* eldest
captain, and the rank, command, arid emoluments
ofliutenant c Intel | so would the
eldest captain be m ?j'>rt vvirh the pay uf
captain, and die rank, cortunand, .-md etno!.
umens of major; so with the eld-st rt. s*
lieu cnari j wiio would he ciptum, with 'he
pay oI first lieuten m , and tii<? emoluments
of fap'ain ; and so down to tiie foo of the
raiment, where ttiero woal I be ? v icanry,
whicn could bo suppled by 'he brevet second
lieutenant, or ?rad.nteof the M lif irv
Academy, or new appointment, according
to eircumstanees.
Now the i of t'lis plan will be seen
bv exhibiting the cosi of a regiment as it
exists, an i the cost of a regiment with a
Mired colonel on ordinary pay, and it will
be se n that there will he an actual saving
in money, with the advantage that all the
officers would b" effective. If the retired
colonel shall have served forty years, he
will leave eight rations a day to ;he Public,
which eight rations are worth, at twenty
Cents each, (die regulated price.) $1 60 a
day, or $584 a year, and the additional
expense of placing a second lieutenant a
the foot of the regiment will he #3')0 a
year, making an actual saving of $284 a
year. (See tahie herewith, made out by
the paym .stor-general, marked A.*) Now
f the w bole of the officers of the Army,
supposed o he uon-efF-otive, wr? reired
on the same priucipl , h re would be som thing
like twen v officers?elevn "t tin*

j sum of $3 322 Now, to supply Ir? wen.
ty vacant second lieutenancies, occasion"d
by th" retirement of the twenty offic TS
will cost, at $306 each. 80 000 a year;
which sum, deducted front $3,322, leaves
cl< ar saving of $2,322 a year.
By the present system, nil officers receive
full pay ami emoluments, whet'??T
ihey are cap ibleuf s-rvi-o or not, and t ie
effective offic rs are obliged to do the dm\
of :he notKelfective, without any advantage;
but, by the above plan, the non-effective
officer Will have a reasonable allowance
made him on Ij- ing retired, and the officer
who will be obi god to do his duty will re
cetve advanced rank with additional emoluments
: so thn?. if the nronosed plan he
... , ? I I
adopted, it may bo expected tli tt all parti ;s
interested would be satisfied.

and the citizens, and ilto General was
conducted tn mi open carriage nlong the
Levcc and ('anal Street, amid a sea of
human heads, to (he State House. From
thence the procession moved through Canal
and Char r?*s streets to the Place d*Arines
and the Cathedral. The city ha t dions
turned out in Inrg" nutnhers, and madfe cer.
tainly a magnificent display. Hut all die
pride, pomp and circumstance of war was

sire to gaze on the "old G neral." Truly,
he was a spectacle worthy the veeerat on
of the people, who owe so much to his
military achievements. His head was
white, as if the snow of a hundred winters
had fallen upon it ; and the pa'id and wan
aspect of his features indica'ed the near
approach of the aged [Iero to "that bourne
wh'-ti'-e no traveller returns."

For th;s reason thejspeetacle closed at the

The Victor of New Orl-ans has reason to

Mr. Clay, of Kentucky, presented the 1
memorial of a committee of die \m -ricaii i
Silk Society, praying the aid and patronage t
of the Government in the printing and dis
tributing ihe journal of said society. 1
lu presenting this nn morial, Mr. Cla\ 1
said while I am up I will remark that, in <
- - ?
my opinion, there is naraiy n prouucuuu m
winch thiscoun'ry is engaged which is more 1
imporuut to b?? duly atien led to a! this time '
taan iliut of sdk. As an ?>iriiriuhtlr ?I pro- <
duct i: is appropriate to all par s of the coun- |
try. An I among the c u es winch have '
occasion'd the unexampled state ofdis ress I
from which no portion of this wide country <
is exempt, which has increased, is increus. |
inland I wish to God I could S"eany hope t
of its end?at leust among the foreign caus- I
es of this remarkable state of distress, is '
unquestionably that of purchasing so mu h '
abroad. Sir, we must make more a' home
and bring less from abroad if we would re*
move the causes of distress } and this tv- '
mark is applicable to our own produCiions i
in every form, of agriculture as w? ll as of 1
fabrication. And in rega d to silk its' If 1
look at the facts. For seven years pas the <
annual amour.t of it brought into this coun- 1

the udornmen' and luxury of man, silk i
that article 1
Sir, no country can long s'and for which '
the annual imports exceed the exports by 1
sum- $40 000,000 or $50,000,000. And i
if I was not ahsolu ely powerless, if my 1
friends and myself had any power in the i
direction of this Government, I would to- I
morrow impose a duty equal to the maxi- <
mum witch the compromise act udm ts, that <
is, 20 per cent, on this import o! $12,500.- i
()00 m silk. I would lay this du:y on silk, '
and with a view in part, to prevent a dan
gerous excess of revenue, I would distnb. '
re the annual proceeds of the sales of the .0
>ubl c lands to the State os their own proertv,
'o which they are already entitled ;
nd let tins fund assisst them to liquidate
lieir debts, and to fost?r those great inter*
sis which are jus ly dear to them, so far
s there is now -freedom from debt. I would
npose this duty on silk and on other luxfri
s, and if the lands are not necessary to
fie support of this Government, I would disribuie
the proceeds of the lands among the
?.ai?'s who are entitled to them. But we,
it* at least I am no; in the condition to do
rhat I have suggested, and therefore i canlot
do o h'Tw se than to ask that this menorial
he r- f rred *o the ComTftittee oo
damifar* urcs and printed. ^ ^ "*
Mr. Calhoun said : I rose to make no
ipposi ion to the motion, but to make a few
crnarks connected with those topics which
ire now of chief importance and i hope that
lot much more of this session will pass<
i.-roro we shall go deeply into tiiat subject. _

Sir, I differ in totafrom the Senator from
t ritucky as to the causes of distress ; and,
am not mistaken, they H? the very op.
>oiife of what have been o&tgged. To.

The
iscribes to iho importation
rum other causes. He looked upo^rMpW^V
neasure that would, at this time, increase
he credit of the S ates so as to enable them
0 s< II more bonds in foreign markets, as
jositiv- !y injurious. We ship our creditr
md bring in goods. I bold the very reverse
)t what the Senator has indicated as the
rue policy, anJ I hope for an early oppor*
unity of pointing out that policy, and that ^
tt an earl) day we shall look deep into the
subject.
Mr. Clay. This is a li:tie unusual, to
ngage in a discussion on this subject thus
>< tore the time. Sir, have I proposed or
iuggesteo a revival of the tariff further than
lh compromise allows? Not in the slightest
degree, I merely proposed a duty on
1 lk, as an article of luxury, ei tirely con*
iistent with the compromise. Sir, what
vas it thai I proposed 1 It was simply that
he maximum duty of the compromise?That
is, twenty per cent,?should be hnjose
i on silk, which is in no way iacomjuiible
with the compromise. ,
An i how can this injure the manufactures
ofco:ton, shipbuilding, or any thing
il.se, which are now nearly prostrated ? The
vo Icti manufacture at the North is almost
ru irely stopped, and that of iron itself is
unong the most languishing. How can
he duty on this luxury affect either thu
nunuiac urea or agriculture oftl^ coun:ry
\ It will benefit them ; for it will direct*
y aid the nianufu-tu e of silk, and, if raw
?i!k is pio luced wi h success, it becomes a
it obj ct for importation, and it may aid
'really m r moving that ruinous excess in
he balance of trade, which will crush us all,
juIoss ttie people can rise to
And the State debts? Sir, I should liko
o know by what right (lie subject of Statu
]< bis is >o frequently dragged into this
Senate, and tne States are here chided nnd
:ensur?'d as if un ler our supervision. Who
jive* us jurisdiction over them ? By what
tuthor ty have we the right to sny to Penn*
tylvittiia, or Illinois, or any other S ate, you
extravagant; \ou have got in o debt; ami
we will leave you to get out a* you can.?
Whence is this right? Who made it tho
day of the Federal Government to give lec. yff
Hires 10 the States on getting into this debt t
But those debts have be -n contracted, and,
us tho S nator from South Carolina says,
one effect of it has been to enlarge our im?
por s, becaus tho means arising from the
S.aie bonds has been thrown into the chan.
rod iff commerce. Bu' it will be no longer
<o, for tiiat very means will now become
in obstruction to commence. But thoso
J bts exis% and, as men of honor and lions'v,
those who owethein must pay them ;
md 1 rus1 no man here will be so destituto
if honor u;,d probity as to say they ought
101 to be p.id. Titey have been contrac?'d,
and our Stales h.ive received the bene,
it; and I believe that not a S ate of this Un. .
ion will be so lost to honor and good faith
is not to p iy such debts. The debts exist,
md in ihe worst forms, b c ?use the foreign r
is .tgn nst us. riot as a whole, but a9 dL
vided into parts, as separate members of the
Confederacy, on whom th'Te is foreign
Job , and consequen 1> for- ign influence.
And what is to be done ? The States
have here proposed nothing, ineiiher branch,
of Congress. But we know of the exist.
fn eofihese debts, mid the distress which
prevails in these different communities J and
we know ilia taxation will be necessary.? ,
Some of i he States, right or wrong, havo
contracted debts to an ex ent which the
leopie camo* bear; and if we are not desliute
of all those feelings which ought to
belong to a parent Government, and which,
in such, wo should cherish, we ought deeply
to sympathize with all these sufferings.
Well, and what suggestion did I make?
Was it to assume these debts? No, sir;
no, sir. But we are in possession of an
important fund, which, of right, belongs to
he States. The States have no power of
KnuosKiu duties on tmporis for the Duroose
jf lelicving themselves. And what was
in> suggestion T The debts exist, and must
be paid, principal and interest j and my 4
suggestion' was, that we should give up
wii.it belongs to the States, or, at least, do
wnut we can for them, by imposing duties
on articles purely of luxury, and give tho
States their own property, the proceeds of
t e public lauds, which would of itself bo
sufficient to pay the interest on a debt of
$100,000,000, and 1 believe the wbole
amount ot the Siate debts is not much more
than $100,000,000. But.I havo been
drawn into an exhibition of these views on
an occasion which 1 had no! intended it. I
merely meant to moke some suggestions
appropriate on presenting a memorial. The
^uator front South Carolina thought fit to
express, what is not at oil extraordinary.
