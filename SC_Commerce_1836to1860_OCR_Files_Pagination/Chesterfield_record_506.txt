in which the certificates ofdeposite were
obtained that have been the means by
which the iate extensive frauds have been
committed.
"I wrote to you on the 12th inst. advising
you that I had no knowledge of
what you referred to in relation to Mr.

been attempted on the Bank of America.

this Bank, issued tw a Mr. Robert D. Mackey
for sm 11 sums were presented to us
yesterday and this morning, for payment,
altered in a very ingenious manner to
thirteen thousand dollars each one of
which had been negociated to the Commercial
Bank of Kentucky, Louisville. An
extensive and singular hold system of
fraud has been perpetrated, and I trust
your Bank will not have been the victern
of it. Our police is at work, and wc
have offered a considerable reward for the
detection of the culpable parties, but I
fear no good is to be done here now,
but I am not without hopes that something
may have turned up to excite suspicion

ATROCIOUS MURDER
The foNnwing letter which was recicved
by the Post Master at this place a few
days since, details one of the most cold
blooded murders which has ever been
perpetrated in Georgia. We present it un.

April 15, 1841, $
Dear Sir?There was found on yesterday
morning about one mile from Gordon's
Ferry, on Flint River, near the residence
of Mr. Corley, a man who was murdered
evidently with a hand hatchet, by being
struck three blows on the head, and then
having his throat rut on the left
side with a knife. The circumstances
are these, as near as can be ascertained:
there were two men traveling together,
whose names are Hammond, which is
the name of the murdered man, and the
otlwr who seems to be a New-Yorker,
thie is, by appcaranco, and says his name
is Bwftlet W Murdoch; he is now under ar.
rest with strong suspicions of being the
perpetrator of the dead. He savs that he
f came from your town, and fell in with this
! man. Ham mod had a grav- horse; and
Murdock was traveling in an open top
huggy, and drove a bay horse. I think
Murdock is a fairskined man with light,
| very light hair, and about 23 or 24 years
' of age. The man murdered, seems to
| be about 33 years old, heavy beard and
dark hair, would weigh perhaps 165 or
170 !!>?. It f-e.uns the two men were
i travellmgjtogether, and stopped at a house
and got their supper evening before last,
! and bought corn and fodder for their hor;
ses. Hammond proposed to Murdock to
stay all night, hut Murdock refused and
said thev would go to Talhotton that
1 night which was 14 to 15 miles; but they
did not go more than a mile before thev
O "
> <*nmnpd within fifty yards of Mr. Corlev's
I I ""
s j bouse. Murdock went to the house to
get a piggin and some water, with the
promise to return it in the morning.?
About davlight he was seen to start from
! the camp without bringing the pail hack.
The ladv then went out to tne camp to
look for the pail, found it and found blood
. on it. She 9aw where something had
been dragged off; thinking they had
killed a pig, followed the sig?% and in
fifteen steps of the spot, found a small
mound be.hind a log?she soon gave notice
(her husband having brcn a cripple
for the last 12 or 14yearsand unable to
walk) to a near neighbor who came to the
spot; and on removing the dirt found it was
a man. There being but t*o at the
camp Murdock was immediately pursued
and arrested bv an officer and upon search
and examination, there was found blood
upon his huggv. On opening his trunk
there was found the hatchet with the eve
orit all hloodv, and the blade, the instrument
with which he dug the grave, per.
fre'ly covered wi h c'ay, (the grave wasa.
bout 5 fee tlong I deep and IS inches wide)
which answered to the clav on tho grave,
the gaps in the axe fitted the bruised places
of the carf of the bush cut near the grave.
There was found in his trunk the pants
he wore at the house w here he ate supper,
part of the straps were cut off. evidently
to hide the blood, hut they were hloodv
?there was found blood on his shirt and
coat, blood on his socks, which had been
washed. There wa9 found on Murdock's
person a bowie knife engraved on the
handle J. J. H. I have thus given you
the particlarsasl learned thr,won tho spot
from the officers. It may he, that IT.immond
may have some friends in your
town or county. If so, give them some
information as soon as yoti can.' As to
Bartlet VV. Murdock, (as his papers
shows him to he of that name) there can

may be, the horse and carriage he
has, and which he claims, may not l?e his

tears over the grave of a deceased Presi.

in the operation of the constitutional provision

justly regarded as one of the strongest

The i.atk President of the Unithd

General Harrison hns drawn from all parties
and from all classes, in the United

the honor, the dovoted patriotism, and the
sterling integrity which marked his character.
That much of public virtue has departed
with General Harrison cannot he denied.
That much is left behind, for the honor
and safety of the American Union, we
firmly l>e!ieve.
The political combat, which resulted in
the election of General Harrison, was as

That a struggle of this decsription should

like honorable to American character and

for the permanence of their present

a recommendation.
; When a Christian People feel themselves
to l?e overtaken by a great public
calamity, it becomes them to humble
themselves under the dispensation of .
Divine Providence; to recognise His
righteous government of the children of
men, to acknowledge His goodness in

and to supplicate His merciful protection
for the future. #
The death of William Henry Harrison,
late Presidenlof the IJnited States,
so soon after his elevation to that-high i
office, is a bereavement peculiarly calcu
lated to he regarded as a heavy afilic- (
tion, and to impress all minds with the
uncertainty of human things, and of the J
dependence of Nation?, as well as of in- 1
dividuals, upon our Heavenly Parent.
I have thought, therefore, that 1 should
be acting in conformity with the general
expectation and feelings of the community
in recommending, as I now do, to the (
People of the United States, of every religious
denomination, that, according to ,
their several modes and forms of worship, <
they observe a day of Fasting and Prayer,
by such religious service? as may be suitable
on the occasion; and I recommend
Friday the fourteenth day of May next,
for that purpose; to the end that, on that
day, we may all, with one accord, pin inhumble
and reverential approach to Him,
in whose hands,we are, invoking Him to
inspire us with a proper spirit and temper
of heart and mind under these frown? of
His Providence^ and still to bestow His
grac'ous benedictions upon our Government
and our country. JOHN TYLER.

ADDRESS,
To all Religious Congregations in the State
of South-Carolina, Friendly to the Distribution
of the Bible.
christian jihetiiren
We address you in behalf of the Bible
Convention recently convened at Columbia,
the minutes of whose proceedings are
herewith transmitted. By theso mi
.? - ...ill Ina.n ?li?f thfl cirwrln aK.
present to you, Christian Brethren, those
views and considerations which seem to
us appropriate to this interesting crisis in
the progress of the Bible cause.
In soliciting your cordial co-operation
in this blessed work, we feel an unwaver.
ing confidence, that you will readily and x
joyfully unite with us in hastening its
accomplishment;?and that you will not
regard us as urging you to the performance
of a painful service, but as inviting you
to the enjoyment of a high privilege. As
Christians you need no arguments from
us, to convince you of the priceless value
of the Word of God; or of its indispensable
necessity to the safety and happiness
of every portion of the human family.
Knowing and feeling that the Bible is
the solid basis of your trust, the charter
of your dearest hopes, and your only refuge
from guilt and despair;?-that its precious
truths.are the fountains of your consols,
tions, its promises your unfailing so'ace
in affliction, and its heavenly light your
only guide through the darkness and perils
of life?von cannot fail to be deeply impressed
with the importance of this treasure
to all our fellow men, and the deplorable
condition of those who are suffering
a famine of the Word of Life. * ,?
Permit us, however, to call your atten
tion to some considerations, which, however
familiar they may have long been to
your mind9, may now be invested wit'i a
fresh and peculiar interest.
Call to mind what the Bible has done
for this fallen world; as evinced by th"
immeasurable contrast of condition and
character, between those nations blessed
with it* holy light, and tbo9e shrouded in
the deep darkness of Pagan ism; and by
the transforming, elevating energy- of its
