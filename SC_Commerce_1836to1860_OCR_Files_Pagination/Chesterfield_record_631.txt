ATLANTIC AND PACIFIC ("ANAL.
In the year 182o the special attention
of our Government was called to the stih.
ject by the . new Republic of Central
America. We were proliered by means ;
of treaty an equal participation in the ;
advantages to be derived ' y the proposed j
M ork. A charge u'uduires was appointed j
by our Government with special instruc- j
# Iir. r> . irx lu'ii ivird the laciil- 1
/"H'o iu iiMcaiignic nnii . - .
Hies which the routes offered, h it no re- ,
port was ever made. la 18^20 a memorial
was presented to Congress hy a New
Vork eompnnyr |,raying for aid Ironi the
'Government to cunstruct tho proposed
Work, and the matter wo helievo was favorably
entertained hy the Ionise of"Representatives,
hut then; Jbeing no definite
action upon it, the schcnVe totally failed.
In 1830, the Government of Central A- j
merica made a contract with a society of :
the Netherlands, under very favorable
auspices, hut owing to some difficulties
which soon after occurred between Holland
and Be giu n, it was finally ahan- '
doned. In 1935 a resolution passed Con. ;
gress, requesting tho President to consider
the expediency of opening negotiations
with Governments more immediately
concerned, in order *o secure hy treaty
Ihe privilege to individuals or cooipa.
nics of constructing the work, and permitting
all nations the free use of it, on j
the payment yf reasonable tolls. A sj>e..
?-ial niront was nonointttd hy (ion. Jack- ,
water, and by clearing out obstructions
- and lockage mav be made navigable for
ship* of any classes. The whole length of*
tiie route would be about 141) miles. The
work is declatrd lo lie entirely practicable.
The only difficulty of any great magnitude
which presents itself, is the very
large excavation necessary to admit shinl
through the tunnel. Tunnels of greater
length but less heights are contemplated
in some of the works of improvement in
this country. Nothing in reality is requisite
hut funds to complete the work,
and these we are wejl assured, will he
furnished at 110 distant period. The cost
variously estimated at from twenty
millions to thirty millions of dollars. No
doubt hut laborers can he procured in ,
Central Ameriea much cheaper than in
the United States though provisions
mav tic somewhat higher fiom the scar*
w ?
city.
The advantages to ho derived from this >
work when completed, must he immense. :
The distance of China, Japan, and the 1
Indian Archipelago would lie somewhat j
shortened, and'thc trade from the United !
Slates would he greatly facilitated by the
more favorable latitude for winds and currents.
The trade to the Pacific would he
immeasurably extended. The infant colony
planted at the month of the Colum.
bin river west'of the Rocky ^fountains i
>Yu\|td increase in population, commerce,
and trade; its resources would ho devel- i
oped, ami, in t|ie course of time, become :
a valuable acquisition to our national I
wealth.
This work would do much to restore |
peace and tranquillity in the distracted ;
. country of Central America. In tiic Ian- \
guage ofAIr. Stephens, ??a gr^at citv will j
grow up rn the heart of the country, j

thoy roll into the interior; 1ier magnifi.
cent mountains and valleys, now weeping
in desolation and waste, will smile
and be glad. * * New markets will he
opened for products of agriculture and
manufactures,* and the intercourse and
communion of numerous and immense
fc^dieg ftf the human race will assimilate
and improve the" character of nations."
Jtalejed, the whole world is interested in
ft II J
son to proceed thither and carefully ex. !
amino the contemplated routes of com i
nmnication, both ait the isthmus of Pan. !
lima and at Nicaragua Lake. This !
agent examined tlie former route and re- j
ported that a ship canal u*is impracticn. J
hie at that point ; but, unfortunately, the >
latter route was not examined. Much as
has l>cen said and written, and the many j
speculations which have been indulged j
res|?ecting the practicability and cost ofj
n canal over this r?utc, we balieve that !
only one satisfactory survey has ever
been made. This was made some three ;
or four years since, by a Mr. Bailey, a
half-pay officer in the British Navy, who
was employed by the Government of
Central America. In consequence of the
dissolution of the Government, Mr. Bailey
was ne\er paid tor his labor, and the
result was ntver published, until Mr.
Stephens communicated it in his admirable
work of travel* in Central America,
lately issued. ' Mr. Stephen* per. o ally
examined the most important part of the
route, and gives many valuahl facts con i.ecled
with the subject, never heretofore
published. From the-survey referred to,
it appears that the distance from the Pacitic
ocean to Lake Nicaragua is a frac.
lion less than sixteen miles. The lake
is situated 12$ feet nhovethe level of lie*
ocean; lictween is interposed the Pa I ma
mountain 615 English feet above the lev? !
of the ocean, and 9IU feel above the
level of the lake. It is proposed to as. I
rend nearly half-way tip the mountain hv
means of locks, and then cut a tunnel
through a distance of three miles, and
n '
then descend again to the- lake. The
lake which is ninety-five miles in length
and thirty in bread h, has a sufficient
depth of water for the largest class of
ships, and empties into the Atlantic
through the river S . Johns, which is sevC*
1
cutv nine miles from mouth to mouth.?
This river is navigable at all times for
vessels drawing from three to four feet
liie final completion of the work. Will J
not the United Slates Government see the
propriety of some definite and speedy action
toward securing the incalculable
advantages which will most certainly ac-.
crue? - Xcnia Torch Light.

A SUBSCRIBER.
ALEXANDER DARING, LORD ASHBURTON. i
who has been appointed a special envoy
from Great Britain to this country, was
until lately, a member of the house of
Baring, Brothers & Co, and was raised I
to the peerage in the year 1835. He j
? n * * i
isijowoi years oi age. lie married a ;
daughter o Mr. Bingham, of Philadelphia !
one of the wealthiest men this country J
has produced. His brother, Henry Baring,
also married a oaughtcr of Mr. Bmg.
ham The fortuno of the ladies at the
time of their-marriage was a'mut $5000-,
000 each. Since when it has been greativ
enchanted in value by the rise of real
estate in this country. Their father,
owned 2,000,000 acres of land in the,,
State of Main, and largo tracks in this
State of Penneylvania. The hotel known
as Head's Mansion House, in Philadelphia
was his private residence in that city.?
Bighampton, in Broome county, New
York, was also named for him.
Lord As.hburtnn is the seceond son of j
the late Sir Francis Baring, the eminent ;
London merchunt, who \vj\s? descended
from an old family in Devonshire, and
IB????ajw" ,n hi? i ??i i
was often consuJlod hv Pitt in relation to
commercial affairs. His house is known
to the merchants of the whole civilized
world, and attracted much noiic3 from 1
the public in generat, when he placed j
himself at the head of the great French

THE MINUTE STUDENT.
The Rev. i$. Brewer was distinguished
for puctuiility. When a youth in College,
he was never to be a minute behind
time in attending the lootures of the tu.
tors, or the families were expected to assemble.
One morning, the students
were collected; the clock struck seven,
and all rose up for prayer^ 4iik the tutor, /
observing that Mr. Brewer was not present,
paused awhile.?Seeing him enter
the room he thus addressed^^Ti: 4,Sir,
the clock has struck, and wclfWrh'ady to
begin, hut as you were absent, we sup-|
posed the clock was two fast, and there- |
fore united." The clock was actually j
too fast by some minutes.
Two Irishmen wore one day a gunning
