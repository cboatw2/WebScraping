drawn, and anew law given. That Chris!
did give a hew law en this subject h
abundantly evident.* With regard tc
divorce, it is as explicit as language cat
make it; and nith regard to polygamy ii
is so plain as to have secured the assent o
every portion of the Christain chureh in a!
ages. The very fact that there has beet
no diversity of opinion or practice amonj
Christians with regard to polymany, is r
self decisive evidence that the win of Chris
was dlearly revealed on the subject. Th'<
temptation to continue the practice was a:
.strong, both from the passions of men
and the sanction of the prior ag- s, as in re
garci *.o slaver}*. Vet we find no traces o
the toleration of polygamy in the christiat
church, thougli slavery long continued t?
prevail. There is no evidence that tin
apostles admitted to the fellowship of Chris
bans, those who were guihy of this infrac
tion of the law of marmige. It is indeei
} ossible that in cases where the convert
had already more than one with, the con
nexion was not broken off. It is cvideti
this must have occasioned groat evil. 1
would load to the breaking up of families
the separation of parents and children, a
well as husbands and wives. Under thosi
circumstances the connexion may havi
b^en allowed to continue. It is howeve
very doub"fill whether even this was per
milted. It is remarkable that among th<
numerous cases ef conscience connects
with marraige, submitted to the apostles
this never occurs.

able discussion between the renowned Gcorgt
Thompson, Abo!itioni<\ and our highly esteemed
feilow-ritizen, the Ba\ Mr. Bred;.
(nridge, on the subject of American Siavsry.'
rs Mr. Thompson calls it. Mr.
Breckenridge came to this country about
two months ago, and soon afer he arrived,
there appeared in the i>ublic papers a challenge
signed by Thompson, announcing that
he would like to meet any American gen.
tleman or clergyman to discuss the principles
of Abolition, Colonization, <Ac.. and
Mr. B, accepted it. The disputants met
in Dr. Wardluw's Church, in Glasgow, on
Monday evening, the 13:h instant, and
continued the discussion for five successive
evenings, three hours each evening. Kach
was to occupy the rostrum lor half an hour
at a time. Dr. Wardlaw, the Chairman,
first arose and stated the object and rules of
the meeting, by which there was to be 011
the part of the audience, no expression of
feeling, whether by applauding the speakers,
or rice versa. After making a few remarks
upon the different positions which
each of the disputants, held, and distinctly
stating that Mr. B. was not n slavc-hoWer
^ 1 1 ,1 _
or advocate ot slavery, no resigned me
Door to Mr. B., who began hy saying that
lie was * aware of the delicate position in
which he stood before so large and resectable
an assembly, (upwards of1000) whose
t opinions wore, he was sure, all leaning towards
his opponent; but he besought their
patient hearing, for lie came not to advocate
slavery, or even to dispute the right of
foreigners to interfere in so momentous a
question,-hut he had much fault to find with the
mode which some foreigners had adopted
to free our slaves; and which, if persisted
in, he hoped to prove, would not only defeat
their avowed object,but would be fraught
with the most injurious results both to our
nation and the slaves themselves.'?During
his half hour, he was listened to in silence
and with attention; but it was easy to see,
by the countenances of the audience, and
even of the respectable committee who
ncounied the platform, that lie was plead
ing against prejudice, and had a difficult
task to perform.?Now, Thompson, their
favorite, arose; and, the first and each
succeeding burst of eloquence (for lie is a
fluent and handsome speaker,) he elicited
applause. Cries of4 Hear /' 4 h^arf rang
through the house, in despite of all the worthy
chairman could do to prevent it: and I
was almost afraid Mr. B. would be utterly
discouraged; but true Kentucky blood stirred
in his vein , and nothing daunted, he again
took his turn, and told the folks some facts
they had never heard before. Curiosity
and doubt now seemed to reign, till their
champion again rose, and smoothed over
tilings a little. The next evening Mr. T.'s
arguments were pretty much a repetition of
those advanced 011 the? fust, and Mr. 13. told
h'm so. Whispers were now runningthrough
the crowd that he (Mr. B.) was a 'clever
chieV?dinna yc think, my man, that Thompson's
caught a tartar&c., &c. O11 Wednesday
evening there was less applause
for Thompson : and on Thursday, he was
actually hissed, and Mr. B. marmly applauded.
You may be sure I was delighted a:
the success of my townsman, and at the
same time, I gave the good people of Glasgow
c edit for such good sense, now that
they knew the whole truth; for it was not
of downright falsehood that Mr. T. stoodaccused,
but of not telling the whole truth of
some of his dreadful tales. The last evening
was not so interesting, but each speaker,
at his parting address, was loudly cheered.
Altogether, the discussion was highly
interesting, and 1 have no doubt it v. ill be
productive of much good; especially as the
debate is to be published in extense"

J Singular case of double vision.?At the
London Medical socictv, on the 22d ult. i
; Mr. Field related a remarkable case of!
j double vision, which in some particulars I
I differs from the usual symptoms of suchaf- |
factions. The patient is a young man aged
22d, of abstemious habits, and so studious
. in playing and writing music as frequently
to lose a great portion of his night's rest.
I He first began to see objects double about
j tvro years ago, but lie did -not pay nnv at,
tention to the circumstance. Since then
j the alfection has continued to increase, and
he now sees two distinct objects, one a few
inches above the other; that which be takes
to be the real object, appearing rather the
| brighter of the two. It is only at a certain
! distance that he experiences this pheno'
menon. When near, objects arc not
| doubled. There are no symptoms of disj
ease of the brain. The eye is dark, and
: the pupil does not contract to the usual ex.
I tent of healthy action. What is most re- j
ntarkable in the case is, the fact of both
eyes being similarly affected, so that if the j
patient closes either the same result fol- !
lows as when they both open.Various opin- j
i ions were expressed in the society with re
: gard to the cause. Mr. Kingdon, thought!
! that the habit which the eye had acquired j
1 of looking at two bars of music at once toj
geilier with the abstemious habits of the
j patient, might have had considerable influ;
once iiT the production of the disease.?
| Mr. Pilcher considered it either to be the
result of incipient amaurosis or an irregu- j
lar action of the muscles of the eyes. Mr. i
Dendyand the president thought that the j
j cause must exist in the hall of tiie eye it- !
j self; some alteration,perhaps,in the humors. '
| It was the general opinion of the society I
j that the great application to music should J
| at once be dispensed with by the patient. !

A committee of the "General Convent
of the Democratic party of die ci'v and coi

! communication to Mr. Van Duron, as
| Democratic candidate for the Prcsiden
| embracing a "declaration of Principles"^
j gard to which an u expression of his viev
was asked. Among these " Principle
arc the following:
"Unqualified and uncompromising h
tility to bank notes and paper money a
circulating medium, because gold nndsih
is the only safe and constitutional cum
cv."
Hostility to any and all monoplics by 1<
islation, because they are a violation of I
equal rights of the people.
Hostility to the dangerous and uncon:
tutional creation of vested rights by leg
lation, because they arc a usurpation of I
people's sovereign rights. And we Ik
that all laws or acts of incorporation pass
by one legislature can be rightfully alter
or repealed by their successors.
To this Mr. Van Bin-en replies :
Gentlemen?I have had the honour

YVc hear from Tuskegee that strong hopes ^
arc now entertained, that the Indians, who jH
have heretofore remained friendly, will be nj
speedily removed without much difficulty. A
contract has been lately entered into with a j,j
company of able and enterprising individuals,
to'remove them forthwith, and it is said that 0I
most of them are at this time apparently dis- 0f
posed to emigrate. Many of them have al- j,j
ready encamped, preparatory to their depar- 0f
ture, and others are daily coming in.?It is
very probable, that the imposing force now
quartered in that part of Alabama, has had its ci
' influence in bringing tliein to their present de- N
termination.?Ibid. q?

We see paragraphs going the rounds of the pj.
newspapers stating that the " awful disclosures all
of Maria Monk" have been proved to be false. at
We should rejoice to see proof of this kind; but ^
all that has yet becm given to the public 0f

one half of whom should be appointed by her cjj
opponents, and one half by herself, offering to ith<
let the truth or falsehood of her book be judged wi
of by the report of such committee. Ilcr op- ^
poncnts however, instead of acceding to this
roasonable proposal, after the delay of a year, th(
when they had time to make any change they rie
might choose in the interior arrangement of ^ri
buildings, carry in a committee of their own
appointment, to prove that Maria Monk's ac- th<
count of tiie building is fasle. And the report i
of tliis committee is the proof that the book is cej
false. In our view this movement of those dy
who have charge of the nunnery is a strong lts
circumstance tending to prove the trutli of the
book. ^

Mr. Editor : I beg leave through the ^

Merchants and particularly those who arc the
owners of Wagons, and all who expect to have
goods hauled from the river, to notice the er(
road on which they are to be hauled. It is '

communication is to procure something to be wh
done towards repairing it before the com- ^'r
mcncement of the business season. The wa
writer is aware that there are a few who have en
a knowledge of the state of the road and are m:
willing to contribute either money or labor, c^c
and it is his wish that some of them would
name a day or two in the columns of the Gazette fa
for working on said road. The writer will to
not be backward in doing his part. 38

TEMPERANCE CONVENTION.
A Temperance convention met at Saratoga me
on the Oth instant, and was attended by about caj
400 delegates, coming from almost every State a^(
in the Union and from Lower Canada. Chan- ee}
teller Walworth was appointed President.
Thirty-one resolutions were adopted; among
thera the following.
Resolved, That the proper means of accom- tui
plishingthe above mentioned result [putting da;
an end to drunkeness and its evils] are in our for
view, abstinence from the use, as a beverage,
of intoxicating liquor, and from the making
and furnishing of it to be used by others.
Resolved, That the embodying of all the
ell as adults ill the temperance societies, in
bbath schools and literary institutions,?
herever they are disposed to unite in them, is
our view one of the ** suitable ways" cf prooting
this cause.
Mr. Calhoun attended the recent comencement
of Athens College, Georgia,
/hile there a public dinner was tendered
m in testimony of the very great regard in
liich his44 distinguised public services, espcally
as relates to the question of abolition
id the distribution of the surplus revenue"
re held by "the citizens of Athens and its
icinity." But Mr. Calhoun, in obedience to .
rule adopted several years since, declined
ic invitation.
Gen. Gaines having called upon the Gover>r
of Tennessee for a brigade of Militia to he
nployed on the Western frontier, the Govcrir
promptly issued his order for a brigade of
ilunteers, and the people of Tennessee as
romptly obeyed the call. In the mean time
te Governor towaroeu a copy ot Gen. Gaines'
squisition to the President, who lias counterianded
it, and ordered the volunteers to be
icrely mustered into service and discharged,
ating that if there are any appropriations out.
: which they can be paid, an order to that
Feet will be given.
The reason assigned by the President fur
)untermanding the order is that there are no
(asons set forth in the requisition of Gen.
aincs to justify the belief that the other for)8
at his disposal are insufficient. "To sancm
that requisition," says the Prcsidert, "for
e reasons which accompany it, would warnt
the belief that it was done to aid Texas,
id not from a desire to prevent an iniringeent
of'our territorial or national rights.
The President has also addressed a comunication
to Gov. Morehead of Kentucky, or?ring
the troops called for by the requisition
Gen Gaines, if they have been raised, to be
scharged.
The Georgia Delegates to the Knoxvilie
onymtion have recommended a State Con.
uition on the same subject to be held in

she refused to speak to her and went off in

stated that her true name was Qeorge

to Scotland, putting on boy's clothes, and

of marriage found with her as by the vexon
of the other woman at seeing that her
