own, derived from personal observations and inqui
ries, and from later travelers; and so all might
have done, no doubt, to the advantage of my read
ers, with regard to many other objects. I profess
edly gave the dimensions of that sea as a conjec
ture merely, after repeating many discordant and
irreconcilable accounts. Had I observed the al
ledged agreement of my statement with Dr. Rob
inson’s estimate, I suppose I should have avoided
the appearance of plagiarism by giving a difib rent
number, which would have satisfied my guess
about as well- I read this portion of the ‘ Re
searches’ without perceiving, that Dr. Robinson’s
account claims, and no doubt with a measure of
justice, to rest on scientific data. I had noted
one trigonometrical observation, which seemed to
me not to be very satisfactory.
“ With regard to the Tower of David, which I
saw on my first entrance into Jerusalem, and very
frequently afterward, it being one of the most con
spicuous objects in the holy city, my ‘ Travels’
contain the Results of my own observations, and of
my frequent conversations with Mr. Nicholayson
and others, from whom I learned, that the monu
ment was usually held to be the Hippicus of Jose
phus, whose account I also consulted. It is a
question again, whether I should have substituted
for ray own Dr. Robinson’s account, to which
mine owes nothing.
“ My statement and conjectures about the pool
of Bethesda are also objected to, not as being false,
but as concurring' with Dr. Robinson. A careful
perusal of what I wrote on this doubtful topic will
show, that I expressed no opinion of my own, but
only recounted several contradictory opinions, tra
ditions, and facts, not one of which was derived
from Dr. Robinson, without attempting to recon
cile them.
“ I erroneously referred to Pococke as my au
thority for what I understood to be an old tradi
tion, as well as a prevalent opinion at Jerusalem, in
regard to the subterranean connection between the
fountains concealed by Hezekiah and those of the
Virgin and Siloam. 1 should have quoted Rich
ardson, who says, that the pool called the fountain
of the Stairs,—the fountain of the Virgin, as I un
derstood the passage,—' receives a strong current
of water by a subterraneous passage, cut in the
north side of Mount Zion, which seems as if it
came by a conduit cut through the rock, from the
pool of Hezekiah on the west Bide of the city.’
This statement, which I had in my hand, taken in
connection with what was told me by Mr. Lanneau
and others, as reported in my ' Travels,’ and the
Scriptural accounts, which 1 also carefully consult
ed on the spot, was the basis, and is indeed the sub
stance, of the opinions and conjectures which I
ventured to offer to my readers on this point
“ I will only add, with regard to the several to
pics selected by the Reviewer for animadversion,
that I have not knowingly derived either facts, ar
guments, or opinions from Dr. Robinson. What
his views were on these points I had never an in
timation, until I read the ‘ Researches’ in 1842.
I have not since referred to that able and learned
work ; but I had not supposed, that it laid claim to
original discovery in connection with these topics,
except in the case of the ancient arch. My com
panions in the Desert and in Palestine, I think,
would all certify, that I worked hard and examined
every thing for myself. Every attentive reader
will perceive, that 1 take all proper occasions to do
justice to Dr. Robinson’s excellent volumes. I
certainly have seen no reasons for changing my
opinions about the identity of the Holy Sepulchre ;
but my language on that subject was unguarded, if
it led the Reviewer to think, that it was from su
pAtitious reverence, ‘I stood on my knees and
had a taper in my hand,’ in examining the place of
the Cross. The room was dark, and this, or some
more lowly, att itude was necessary for the attain
ment of my object. “ Stephen Olin.

NORTH OHIO CONFERENCE.
We make the following extract from the pro
ceedings of this Conference, as published in the
Western Christian Advocate, simply that our read
ers may be advised of the state of ecclesiastical
affairs in that section, while we must be allowed
conscientiously to dissent from the entire action,
save the first vote. We believe, that an interfer
ence with the constitution of the church at this
juncture is impolitic and unnecessary.
The committee appointed to take into considera
tion the circular from tiie New York and Genesee
annual Conferences, beg leave to report:
That in respect to the request of the Genesee
Conference, in which they solicit a concurrence of
the North Ohio Conference, in petitioning the next
General Conference so to alter the item in the
General Rules on slavery as to read as follows,
viz., “ The buying or selling of men, women or
children with an intention to enslave them, or the
holding of them as slaves, in any state, territory or
district, where the laws of such state, territory or
district will admit of emancipation, and permit the
liberated slave to enjoy freedom,” the committee
recommend a non-concurrence in said resolution.
That in respect to the resolutions of the New
York Conference, in which they solicit a concur
rence. of the North Ohio Conference in recom
mending to the next General Conference so to
alter the item in the General Rules on “ spirituous
liquors,” as to substitute Mr. Wesley’s original
rule, which is in the following words, to wit,
“ Drunkenness, buying or selling spirituous liquors,
or drinking them, unless in cases of extreme neces
sity,” the committee recommend concurrence.
Also in respect to the following resolution of
the New York Conference, viz., Resolved, by the
New York annual Conference, That the next Gen
eral Conference be authorized and requested to
suspend the fourth item in the restrictive regula
tions so as to make the rule on slavery read as fol
lows, viz., “ The buying or selling of men, women
or children with an intention to enslave them,” the
commitee recommend concurrence.
On motion, the Conference adopted so much of
the report as recommended non-concurrence in the
resolution of the Genesee annual Conference by a
vote of 94 in the affirmative to 1 in the negative.
So much of the report as relates to the New
York annual Conference resolution on the rule in
relation to spirituous liquors was adopted by a vote
of 80 in the affirmative, in the negative none.
So much of the report as relates to the proposed
change in the restrictive regulations of the Disci
pline was adopted by a vote of 80 in the affirmative
to 1 in the negative.
The Georgia Conference-This body has
been in session in this city since the 17th instant.
Bishop Soule, presiding, and is expected to close its
labors probably about Friday. The late inclem
ency of the weather, and the bad state of the roads,
have prevented the session being as full as usual,
though we understand about on<| hundred itinerant
Minister! are in attendance, We have had preach
ing from them regularly, once a day oroftener, both
in the Methodist and Baptist Churches ; and it is
but justice toward these zealous Heralds of the
Gospel, to say, tbat their Conference is composed
of men of the highest intellectual worth and reli
gious usefulness. An occasional visit to the Ly
ceum Hall, where they transact business, has sat
isfied us, too, that he u who shall bo able to stand”
before this body, in the examination of his claims
to the Ministry, will thereafter present himself to
the public confidence under very strong guaran
ties of being “ well qualified.”
Bishop Soule is a venerable old gentleman, Baid
to be about 70 years of age, and to have been en
gaged in the Ministry now going on forty-six years.
He is a native of Massachusetts, and resides in the
State of Ohio, if a man may be said to live any
where who has “ gone into all the world” so often
and so long. Added to his clerical talents, and
deep personal piety, he seems also to be a man of
striking business habits, fulfilling in an eminent
degree the Quaker maxim, that whenever he
speaks he has something to say.
The appointments to Circuits, &c. will not be
read out until near the close of the Conference,
and will appear in our next week’s paper.—Colum
bus Enquirer.
Sunday School Missionaby Society.—The
Sabbath schools in Hillsborough, Highland county,
Ohio, on the 31st of December, 1843, formed
themselves into a missionary society. The school
consists of about one hundred and twenty»five
scholars, and there are in attendance about twenty-*
five teachers. Good order is kept, considering the
number of young scholars.
At the first effort that was made toward making
a collection, twenty-three dollars were subscribed,
and part paid in. The next Sunday it was tried
again ; and considerably more was subscribed and
paid. One class, consisting of six scholars, sub
scribed Jive dollars; and I believe the amount is
nearly all paid into the treasury. The young men
who compose this class have all to work for their
living. They have cast the rest of the school in
the shade. The missionary cause is one in which*
all the people ought to engage, whether they be
long to any church or not. It is a cause that every
person in the world ought to feel interested in.
Those who have the means ought to look at the
liberality of these young men, and do likewise.
Sunday schools ought to come up to the work
with a determination to do all they can. If the
preachers would form all the Sunday schools into
missionary societies, the missionary cause would
receive an impetus that could not easily be stopped.
—Cor. of the Western Christian Advocate.
Presbyterians and Congregationalists in
Wisconsin.—The Boston Recorder, in noticing
the prospects of the Home Missionary Society says,
an union of the Presbyterian and Congregational
ministers and churches of Wisconsin in “ General
Convention,” was formed between three and four
years since, in circumstances of much solemn'ty
and interest. It embraced then the entire Terri
tory. The increase of ministers and churches had
made it necessary to divide the General Conven
tion into three District Conventions, viz. the Mil
waukie, Beloit, and Mineral Point Conventions.
Their Constitution and Confession of Faith are
given in detail, and are such as encourage the
hope of lasting harmony, and effective co-operation.
A Good Example. —We learn from one of our
correspondents, that a young man in rather strait
ened circumstances, desiring very much to sub
scribe for a religious Journal, felt himself at con
siderable loss to determine how he should
manage so as to accomplish his purpose. Indeed,
he had well-nigh given up all hope of securing the
requisite amount; when his faithful pastor sug
gested to him, that by denying himself the use of
tobacco, he might Bucceed. He immediately acted
upon the suggestion. And I need scarcely add,
that while he is equally well off as to health, he
enjoys the pleasure of perusing a religious and
literary periodical.
EXPENSES OP DELEGATES TO GENERAL
CONFERENCE.
To the Ministers in charge of Methodist Congre
gations.
Dear Brethren,—You will recollect that the
General Conference of the M. E. Church is to hold
its next session in the city of New-York, in May
next; and that the Discipline of the Church re
quires that collections be taken up in every place
toward defraying the traveling expenses of the Dele
gates to that body. The moneys thus collected are
to be carried up to the General Conference, put
into the hands of a committee, and divided among
the several delegates, according to the amount of
their expenses. Now, that these expenses should
be paid, all reasonable persons will acknowledge.
But hitherto the collections have never been suffi
cient to pay them. Once, it Is recollected, the dele
gates were sent back to their several annual confe
rences for one-half their expenses, and it is known
that some of these expenses have not been recei
ved to this day. This method of disposing of the
matter is unequal and unjust. For, first, the dele
gates from those conferences which are near the
seat of the General Conference will have com
paratively but little expense to pay, and the confe
rences to which they belong are, in general, the
most able. And, secondly, the moneys in the hands
of the annual conferences belong to the deficient
and worn-out ministers, and widows and orphans
of deceased ministers, very few of whom ever re
ceive the full amount of their very slender claims ;
and therefore ought not to be deprived of any part
of the moneys in hand : and it is cruel and unjust to
| send men as our representatives to transact our
business and leave them to bear their own ex
penses. To remedy the evil, therefore, the
General Conference has generally drawn on the
Book Concern for the balance of these expenses,
and this, it is acknowledged, under the circum
stances, was their only remedy. But the ob
jection, to a certain extent, will lie against taking
these expenses from the avails of the Book Con
cern, as these avails are to be paid over to the an
nual conferences, and by them applied toward the
liquidation of the claims already referred to. The
above being a true statement of the case, it is
humbly conceived that it is the duty of every cir
cuit and station within the limits of the Church, ac
cording to their ability, to raise their proportion of
all the expenses of the delegates to the next Gene
ral Conference, that the Book Concert! may not be
taxed to pay them. And this is more imperiously
required at the present time from the fact, that the
times are, and a few years past have been, more unfa
vorable to the interests of this Concern than former
ly ; both in relation to the sale of books, and collec
ting its debts. It is hoped, therefore, dear brethren,
that you will give due attention to this subject.
That those of you who are laboring in the central
conferences will nol think because your own dele
gatee have not far to travel and will not have great
expeneee that therefore you need not make great
exertions to raise moneys for this purpose ; and that
such as are in more distant fields will not suppose
because money is scarcei business dull, and produce
rather difficult to turn into cash, that therefore you
may depend upon others, or on the Book Concern,
instead of a prompt attention to this part of your duty;'
but that every one will exert himself to raise his
due proportion of the amount, for be ye well assu
red that the unfavorable circumstances of the times
is a very cogent reason why a general, timely, and
determined effort should be made to meet these
expenses independent of the funds of the Methodist
Book Concern. Dear brethren, it may be thought
that in obtruding ourselves upon you in relation to
this business we are assuming to dictate in a matter
that does not belong to us ; but to this we will only
say, we do not claim the right of dictation, but
merely as your humble servants to stir up your pure
minds by way of remembrance respecting what we
conceive to be a very important branch of pastoral
duty, but which in the multifarious duties of your
office you might lose eight of unless your attention
should thus be directed to it.
Hoping therefore that your goodness will influ
nce you to pardon the liberty we have taken in di
recting your attention to this subject, we subscribe
ourselves, Your brethren in Christ,
G. Lame & P. P. Sandford.
GENERAL INTELLIGENCE.
FOREIGN.
LATER FROM ENGLAND.
Liverpool, Dec. 30.—The results of the year
which are now before us are in their general fea
tures highly satisfactory. The improvement ex
pected at its beginning has been slow, but gradual
and progressive. An immense business has been
done, labor has been provided for the operative
classes, provisions are cheap and plentiful, and as
the raw materials wanted by our manufactures are
,in abundant supply, and at moderate prices, there
is a fair prospect of a further and continuous im
provement in the commerce of this country, which
as it gives the tone to the trade of the world wili,
it is to be hoped, lead at no distant period to a more
general revival of business.
The complaints of an inconvenient abundance of |
money are still resounding from all quarters, there
must now be about 14 millions sterling in the cof
fers of the Bank of England, and as these stocks
are still in a course of increase they may soon
reach the enormous amount of 15 millions; besides
which there are many millions unemployed in the
hands of Bankers and Capitalists, a proof that the
accumulation of capital is going on largely. Our
3 per cent stock has nearly reached par, and the
railroad shares and other good undertakings are at
such prices as to leave but a moderate return for
investments, employment will therefore be wanted
for capital, and as confidence in the stability of the
improved aspect of mercantile affairs becomes
more consolidated we cannot but think that part of
this abundance will find a vent in trading opera
tions, and thus give a further impulse to the busi
ness of the year before us.
A good deal of excitement prevails as to whether
any, and what alterations will be proposed in our
fiscal system during the approaching sessions ; |
many seem to look with confidence to a change in I
the duties on Corn, Sugar, and Tobacco, while
others believe that nothing will be done for the
present. It is much to be wished that an uncer
tainty so injurious to business may soon be ended.
The prospects under the continued combined in
fluence of peace and plenty are certainly more
cheering than they have been for many years past.
Money will readily be found for any legitimate un
dertaking whether commercial or otherwise, how
ever extensive, but if a spirit of speculation should
be indulged in to an undue extent, capitalists will
soon take the alarm and discountenance such oper
ations.
We refer to the annexed comprehensive review
of the Cotton trade of Great Britain for the details
of the extraordinary development of the capabili
ties of this branch. It will be seen that no less
than 1,740,000 bags of Cotton of 300 lbs. have been
delivered to our manufactures and spinners within
the twelve months, and have been (with the ex
ception of the trifling excess in the stock of Cotton
held by the spinners) converted into yarn and man
ufactured goods, and as the stocks of these in Man
chester are but light, this enormous quantity has
apparently been called for by the actual wants of
our customers. Large as this increase undoubtedly
is, theie is every prospect of its progressing still
and perhaps rapidly, as soot, as the intercourse with
the northern ports in China is fully established and
consolidated.
As soon as we have our returns from the Conti
nent, we shall forward our usual general Colton
statement, meanwhile we are prepared to find hea
vier stocks every where except in France. As to
the results we apprehend that the spinners and
manufacturers of the Continent have no great
cause for congratulation, and that very little if any
extension has taken place.
Up to the month of August the operations in
Cotton were unprofitable, except in isolated cases;
since then our market has been buoyant and im
proving, mainly owing to an increasing belief in a
moderate Cotton crop in the United States. There
is, however, a great variety of opinion as to its ex
tent, the majority appear to decide for a crop of
1,900,000 bags, there are as many who believe in a
crop of 1,800,000 bags as there are for one of
2,000,000 bags, and the few extremes take the out
side of 1,600,000 and 2,200,000 bags. It cannot be
denied that the medium quantity of 1,900,000 bags
would warrant a somewhat higher range of prices
than the present ones, provided that the present
/ate of consumption be kept up, and that business
should continue to improve. It is however unne
cessary to keep in view that our stocks are larger
by 230,000 bags than in any former year, which
will make up for a considerable deficiency in the
future supply, and that the advance which has oc
curred in prices will no doubt lead to an increased
import from the East Indies. The last advices
from China are very discouraging for Cotton, and
it is not improbable that as our exports of Goods
and Yarns to that quarter increase the demand for
the raw material will decrease there in the same
proportion. The great impulse to the demand for
Cotton Goods has been caused by the prevailing
low rates, and it is an indispensablo condition to its
continuance upon the present extensive scale that
prices should be moderate, our customers have
been too long accustomed to them to go along with
us in any considerable advance; upon these
grounds we found our opinion that those who look
for very high prices on account of moderate stocks
and abundance of money will be disappointed, and
we have no hesitation in saying, that if from a pre
vailing spirit of speculation, prices should be run
up unduly, it will be of short duration, and will
be productive of the most injurious consequences
to those who engage in it.
Ireland.—The N. Y. Herald contains a letter
from Dublin which affirms the existence of plots
for massacreing the Protestants, burning cities, and
in short waging civil war on the first opportunity.
The letter alludes to the constant increase of the
forces and munitions of war in Ireland as proof that
the Government are aware of such plots. No
great credit is to be given to such stories,—which
if true in part, are likely to be false in everything
that constitutes their atrocity.—Chaleslon Mercury.
Fatal Superstition.—A gross and fatal in
stance of suuperstition has occurred in Cheshire.
Among the labourers of the Grand Junction Rail
way, at Crewe, are several Mormonites; one of
whom, Pugmire, induced his wife, by his importu
nities, to be baptized unto “ the order.” The offi
ciating priest was one Cartwright, a blacksmith ;
the time was Thursday night, the 23rd November.
It was dark and stormy; the river was swollen
with rains, and the stream was rapid. Although
about to be confined with a fourth child, the woman
was stripped almost naked, and led into the water,
The priest happened to lose his hold of her arm;
she was carried away by the stream, and drowned.
The hnshand went home, and told his neighbours
saying it was the will of God that she should bo
drowned,” and addins', that it was the weakness of
her faith that caused it; but he was now satis
fied that she was in glory." A coroner’s jury
returned a verdict of “ Manslaughter” against Pug
mire and Cart wright: and they have been commit
ted to Castle for trial.
DOMESTIC.
An American Brio Searched bt a British
Man of War Schooner—We have been fa
voured by Captain Moore, of the brig John M.
Clayton, which arrived here yesterday from Barba
does, with an extract from the brig’s log, by which
it appears that on the 1st inst., inlat. 13 30, Ion 61
00, while on the passage to Barbadoes, a British
Man of War schooner, said to be the Hornet, fired
a gun for him to heave to, that the (Capt Moore)
hoisted the American flag and kept on his course;
that the schooner fired again and her shot fell short
of him; he still kept on his course, and she fired a
third shot, which passed under the brig’s stern;
and that she then fired a fourth shot which passed
between the brig’s masts. Captain More then
hove to, until the schooner sent her boat alongside
with an officer and five men. Tne officer over
hauled the brig’s manifest and papers, saying to
Capt. Moore that he came very near firing into him.
He then searched the hold, ordered the captain to
make sail on the brig, and returned to his schooner.
Capt. Moore authorises us to say that the report
in the Herald a day or two ago was not correct, and
that that he was not off the Isle of Pines, as was
stated in that journal.—N. O. Tropic.
Raleigh, N. C. Jan. 26.—We have never been
called to the performance of a more painful duty,
than falls to our lot in announcing the sudden
death of the Hon. William Gaston, which occurr
ed in this City on Tuesday last. He was in the
enjoyment of his usual health the morning of that
day, and took his seat upon the Bench of the Su
preme Court, now in session in the Capitol. He
was taken suddenly ill, and removed to the house
of Mrs. Taylor, but improved so much during the
day as to remove all apprehensions of danger.—
About 8 o’clock in the evening, while engaged in
earnest conversation with the Governor, Judge
Ruffin, and some other friendB, he complained of a
sudden return of4^e attack, fell back and expired
without a struggle.—“ In the midst of life we are in
death.—Register.”
Wealth of Ohio.—A correspondent of the
Cincinnati Chronicle says:—In Ohio there are
1559 miles of Rail-Roads and canals built at a cost
of $15,926,328. In Cincinnati there are butch
ered about fifty acres of hogs. It exports also
about the same number of acres of whiskey—deep
enough to float a canal boat, and owns nineteen
twentieths of sixty-seven steamboats, costing $1,
017,000, 11,298 tons, and employing 1,250 hands.
The increase of the WeBt is indeed astonishing.
There have been more buildings erected in Cin
cinnati during the last four years than there were
in fifteen years previous. This year there have
been built 1003 buildings—736 of which were
brick.
Senators.—The Hon. William R. King, of this
State, is the oldest Senator in the United States
Senate, having taken his seat in that body in 1819.
The Hon. Dixon 11. Lewis is also the oldest mem
ber in the House of Representatives, having held
his seat there since 1825. It is indeed a little cu
rious, that Alabama, one of the younger members
of the Confederacy, should thus have in each
branch of congress, members whose term of ser
vice has extended beyond those of any other State.
Such a fact is alike honorable to the constituency
of these worthy public servants, and to these ser
vants themselves; for it speaks volumes in favor
of the abiding confidence of the former, and the
efficiency and faithfulness of the latter.—Dem.
Gazette.
Extraordinary Winter.—We haveconversed
with a gentleman just from Detroit, and who has
travelled constantly during the past eight days, who
states that from Detroit to the Falls, on the Oneida
side, the ground is entirely bare, and no snow is
to be seen. He came the whole way, in a wagon,
from the Falls to within a few miles of Schenecta
dy, and saw no snow on his route. The whole
country west and north of Little Falls, for hundreds
of miles, is free from snow—an extraordinary cir
cumstance. From Schenectady to Poughkeepsie
I there is good sleighing; from the latter place to this
city the River is open and the steamboats run reg
ularly.—N. Y. Express, 9th Jan.
j Withdrawal of Mr. Calhoun.—We publish
to-day the Address of Mr. Calhoun to his friends
I throughout the Union, withholding his name from
the Baltimore Convention, and assigning his reasons
for so doing. The rumour of such a step on his
part has already provoked eager speculation in the
! political world, as to the reasons and motives of his
| withdrawal, and the probable effect of it upon the
j approaching struggle for the Presidency. Be that
what it may, to those who know Mr. Calhoun his
withdrawal from the Baltimore Convention has
been for some time an inevitable certainty.—
Charleston Mercury, Jaunary29.
Appropriations for 1844-5.—The Washington
Spectator of the 9th instant publishes the following
aggregates of the appropriation bills reported to
the House by Mr. McKay, the Chairman of the
Committee of Ways and Means.
Appropriations for the civil and diplomatic expenses
of the Government for the year, commencing
July 1, 1844, and ending June 30,1845,
$3,026,592 92
For the support of the Army, 3,056,375 39
For the Military Academy, 131,845 50
For the Indian Department, and ful
filling treaty stipulations with the
Indians, 932,558 00
There remains yet to be reported the Navy, For
tification, and Harbor bills.
Quite a singular mistake.—A good lady who
had two children sick with the measles, wrote to a
friend for the best remedy. The friend had just
received a note from another lady, inquiring the
way to make pickles. In the confusion, the lady
who inquired about the pickles received the remedy
for the measles, and the anxious mother of the sick
children read with horror the following:—“Scald
them three or four times in very hot vinegar, and
sprinkled them well with salt, and in a few days
they will be cured.”
Oregon—The meeting held at Philadelphia
urging upon Congress the military occupation of
Oregon is described by a Philadelphia Correspon
dent of the London Chronicle and furnishes matter
for general comment. The Chronicle and Sun
speak with great contempt of the American claim
to ownership of the Territory and affect to treat it
as a second attempt to ‘do’ the British ; the first,
repudiating their debts—having succeeded so ad
mirably.
Cold Weather.—On the morning of the 7th
instant, the mercury stood in the thermometer at
Montreal sunk to eighteen degrees below zero.
At Hartford, Connecticut, on the 12th, the mer
cury at Insane Retreat was eight degrees below
zero.
At Albany, 7 below zero.
Steamboat Burnt_Tile steamboat Fanny
Ellsk-, on her way from Apalachicola to Alabama,
Georgia, with an assorted cargo of merchandize,
took tire, on the 5th Jan., and was burned to the
water’s edge. The boat was owned by Capt. L A.
Phelps. No insurance on boat or cargo.

Feb. 2,1844. Treasurer Prudential Committee.
COKESBURY CONFERENCE SCHOOL.
Our patrons and friends are reminded that the exerci
ses of this school will recommence on the first day of
February next. We renew the request heretofore re
peatedly made, that all applicants for admission should, if
practicable, be punctually present at the opening of the
term. This request is suggested by regard for the in
tercets of the student, as well as for the conveniences of
classification.
The attention of our patrons is particularly called to
that regulation of the school which prohibits «my stu
dent from purchasing goods on a credit, without the
permission of the Rector in writing. To enable the
Rectorto give such permission, the consent and authority
of the parent or guardian are first necessary. Our friends,
the friends of youth generally, must perceive and readily
grant the propriety and expediency of such a regulation.
The co-operation of the parent is necessary, to carry it
out and make it effectual. No account made in the face
of this rule, and contrary to its provisions ought to be
paid. Every one has witnessed the tendencies to injudi
cious expenditure, and extravagance in collections of
youth partially released from parental control. Every
parent is immediately interested in checking this spirit.
Matthew J. Williams, Rector.

SEARS’ SEW AND COMPLETE HISTORY
OP THE BIBLE.
In referring to this work it is not necessary that we
enter into long details; let it suffice that we affirm that
the mo6t learned and enlightened of our countrymen
agree in pronouncing it well worthy of the patronage of
every Christian, together with all who refer to the Bible
as a Text Book. It is written in a plain and open style,
which can be as easily understood by the ignorant as by
the educated. It has been remarked by many that the
Bible is written in so obscure a style that few can com
prehend it. Here then we have it expounded and com
mented upon at length, with notes, both critical and ex
planatory, by men who have made it the study of years;
forming of itself a History of near four thousand years.
Two volumes in one, containing near seven hundred large
octavo pages with several hundred engravings, bound ui
the most finished style. Price only <3. For sale by
