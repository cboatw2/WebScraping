Ma. CHOULES' ORATION.
The Oration on the Fourteenth Ann?versa

by Rov. John Overton Choulks' at
the Broadway Tabernacle, October,
1*41.
Mr. President, and Ct-nthmen of
the American Institute:
"Our Country," is a phrase of wide
& and endearing import. Poetry has sung
its charms, patriotism lias felt them, an I
piety has consecrated them. And what n
country, fellow citizens, does God permit
us to call our own ! There is our long
Atlantic coast, with more than two thou
sand one hundred miles of seaboard -kirt.
ing States containing more than 1 million
of square miles. There, loo, is our imperiutn

lying between the Likes and the Gulf of
Mexico, the Alleghanies and the. Rocky

square miles, one hundred thousand miVs

Lest variations of climate upon the globe,
comprehending exactly those degrees
which have been ever marked by the
genius and enterprise of* man.
Our land is a mart for the nations, a
workshop for the earth ; every o?'eai? i>

learned to press inta our service steam

Who that has passed thiough the town
of Worcester, in Massachusetts, has net
admired the taste and beauty of its well
planted trees and shaded avenues? Ail
^ this, I believe, was devised and corn,
menced by a young minister, who, with
out any resources but of taste and genius,
applied himself and a few kindred spirits
to the work of moulding the tast? and
habits of the community, lie was one
of four ministers who formed Worcester !
County Agricultural Society, and in that
County many of the ministers have been
successful farmrrs and they have received
as many premiums as any other class of
men. And while I speak of Massachu
setts, and refer to the clergy, [ am sure
you are all of von reminded of the indebtedness
of every man who cultivates the
American soil to that aide farmer, that
distinguished philanthropist and eloquent
teacher, the Kev. Henry Coleman, late
Agricultural Commissioner for the Commonwealth.
When I read his reports and
letters to the yeomanry of New Kngland.
'I wish that his voice coald he heard in
every farm of our State and Union.*
Mitchell, in htsagriculturnl tour through
Holland, states, that each Divinity student,
before being licensed, has to attend
two vears lectures upon agriculture. I
have no oouht that the usefulness of the
clorgv is much augmented by this step,
and that liieir future influence over the
manners and habits of the country is
greatly increased.
Every schoolboy knows the agricultural
glory of old Rome, and thinks of Varro.
(Jincinnatus, Cato, Virgil, Horace, and
Cicero, in connection with the cultivation
of their mother earth. Tne history of
agricultural improvement is almost the
history of the world, and comes not withjn
iny province; but it is gratifying that
we can trace its most rapid developements
in the land which contains the tombs of
our ancestors, and was the birthplace of
our language, laws, and religion. It was
only at the close of the fifteenth century
that agriculture began to be regarded and
pursued as a science. Fitzhcrbert. a
Judge of the Court of Common l'leas,
wrote the earliest piece upon farming.f

: about one hundred years before the eslabi
lishment of Plymouth Colony or New
Amsterdam. It was published in 1534.
The work imparted much interest to the
pursuit of husbandry. Tusser's Five
I Hundred Points of Husbandry appeared
thirty years after; then came Barnaby
j Genre's 44 Whole Art and Trade of IIus!
bnndry." Sir Ilu^h Plait turned his
i mind to the proper food of the soil, and
' wrote 44 The Jewel Houses." His remarks
1 A! ll
upon manures are sensible, anu sum in
repute. Samuel Hartlip wrote an admirable
treatise, for which he was rewarded
' by that true-hearted patriot and far dis.
j rerning statesman, Oliver Cromwr.il, who
I bestowed upon him a pension. Hartlip
has the merit of having been the first
who recommended a public director of |
husbandry to be established by law. Evelyn
and Tull are names dear to the well,
read and scientific cultivator of the soil ;
and I join with one who has gone before
me in this duty, in declaring that Jethro
Tull is more deserving of a monument
than the Duke ?>f Marlboro'.^
The tune would fail me to run over all
j the names that have helped to make
j England, if not a garden, yet a prodigy of
i agricultural wealth, and that little island

O
rles.
The glorious era from which nil the
triumphs of husbandry now date, is 1793,
when, under the auspices of Sinclair and
Pitt, the British Legislature incorporated
the Board of Agriculture; then surveys
wore made of every county, the resources
of the empire developed and proclaimed.
It is from this period that we may regard
agriculture as a science. The essays
published on turning grassland into arable.
and the culture of the potato, exhibited
the ablest talent of Great Britain,
and have furnished, I believe, some of the
most valuable volumes ever written. The
patronage of the government gnvo interr

of Knglnnd placed their sons with praeti.

j Now, too, chemistry was brought forward

I may regard this organization rf the agri- !

J and artificial grasses. Comparisons led
i to the establishment of facts, and agrij
^
J cult me may now be regarded as an art
resting upon facts.
In almost everv portion of Great T?rilI
ain these societies sprang up, and the
i farmers had the courage and wisdom to
profit by the improvements whieh skill
j and science had introduced, and the re!
suit is, that five millions of all ages, proj
dure annually from her soil seven hundied
millions worth of agricultural produce. In
1700 the growl'! < f all grain in Rngland
and Wales was one hundred and twenty
millions of bushels, in Scotland thirty
j millions, making a total of one hundred
; and fifty millions. In 1840 the produce
l was four hundred and ten millions of
I hushels. Think of seven hundred millions
worth of produce from that little island,
and remember, that competent
judges tell us this may still he doubled!
Agriculture has clothed the most barren
heaths with luxuriant crops, converted
pools and marshes into fruitful m'adows,
and clothed the bleakest mountains with
I groves of fo est trees.
Agriculture has been termed by Sullv
the breast from whence the state receives
support and nourishment. It is the primary
source of wealth and independence ;
and when the soil of a country is in such
a state naturally or artificially, as, under
judicious management, to furnish maintainanre
for more persons than are required
for i;s culture, thence proceeds the
profits of the farmer, the rents of the
landlord, the subsistence of the manufacturer
and merchant, and the greater proportion
of the income of the state. That
surplus marketable produce is justly considered
to l)e the principal source of all j
political power and personal enjoyment ; !
| when that surplus does not exist there
can ho no flourishing town, no naval
force, none of the superior arts or finer i
manufactures, no learning, none of the
convcncinces and luxuries of foreign
lands, and none of that cultivated and j
polished society at home, which not only
the Hon. Daniel Webster, whose thorough acquaintance
with p:actical firming i? exemp'ified
in the very ablest egricn'tural address 1 have
ever road. It wis delivered in Ronton soon at*.
?er his icturn horn Europe. Jl is the fullest '
and tnosL condensed asticlu on husbandry that
we haro acce.-s to, and should l?e reprinted by
the American Iustituto for general distribution.

no library in cur country where even a tolerable

elevates and dignifies the individual, but] <
extends its beneficial influence throughout
society. What exertions, ought to be
made, and encouragement to be give* to
preserve and improve so essential a resource,
this foundation of national pros,
perity. Agriculture does more than feed,
it clothes us: without it we should have
no manufactures, no commerce. These
all stand together like ndlars in a cluster, ?
(he largest in (he centre, and that largest f
is Agriculture. c
Let us look at our own State?the a
Empire State. Her territorial extent is r
ten thousand square miles larger than I:
England and Wales. In 17S3 she had e
not half the population of the States of -l
Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Maryland, t
and Virginia; now her inhabitants are r
two millions five hundred thousand. Our t
Commonwealth exhibits physical capabil- a
ities of wealth and greatness existing to t
an unknown extent, and is fertile in r
most of the productions which minister to
the necessities of man. I envy not the
individual whose heart does not swell t
when he gazes on the bold and magnifi '!
fpnf nmfti?iinn with which the livini? God *
? ? - - . " I
has scattered the proofs of his eternal a
Godhead, and with what a vast an awftil *
scale of grandeur he has piled up the '
mountain and spread out the valley, plan- c
ted the torest and poured forth tlio flood, f
The western portion of our State was, i c
forty years ago, a wilderness?wo now i r
point out to it is a garden, In that time s
seventeen millions of acres of forest land *
have been subdued and brought into iin- '
provemeut. One million five hundred }1
thousand inhabitants are occupied in the H
various departments of civilized life; and H
they are to day in the peaceful possession ^
of more than six hundred millions of prop- r
erty. c
No State in the Union presents to the
farmer the means of health, independence, r
and abundance more amply than our
own; and we arc indeed criminal if we v
do not avail ourselves of till the lights of r
science, and the aids of other lands, in 11
prosecuting our onward march. v
Many of iny hearers have heard that ^
the revival of agriculture commenced in e
f1 landers, about seven htmdroj years ago.. ?
Tiiere the soil was little better than a f
white barren sand, now its increase is '
said !ol?e twice as great as it is in Eng.
land. The grand maxim on which the 1
Flemish farmer acts is, " without manure 1
no corn, without cattle no ninnute, and 1
without root crop-: no cattle can be raised."
Their success may bo resolved into the
following causes: small farms, careful c
manure, rotation of crops, clover and 1,1
roots, cutting their forage, and close, un- '
divided personal attention. The farmer 1
does not lumber, fish, speculate, nor hold s
office. . j
1 have had much opportunity to notice
the conduct of our western farmers; and ,
I am entirely impressed with the belief
that most of them would he better oflf if
they were to be deprived of half their j
lands. Labor and anxiety are all they ^
ran obtain from the extensive cultivation
they now attempt. But there is a perfect
mania for adding acre to acre.
# # ^
The true idea of a farm, is its closest
possible resemblance to a well-conducted ?
garden. The Flemish farmer never *
^ t V
dreams of exhausting his soil in one
| g
place, then moving off* to wear it out in
another, and then in his old age to com- a
nience a new clearing of the forest. If
lean make ten acres vicld me as much ?
* c
as one hundred, by affording it all my
means of improvement, and which was re. c
quired by the one hundred, the conse.
qucnce is, that I have profited in my body ?
and mind in an astonishing degree. I
have saved ten limes the ploughing and
harrowing, ten times the sowing and hoeing,
mowing and leaping, besides ten ,
times the rent.
I fully expect to see the second crop
for more common than it is. With our
powerful sun, we need only efficient ma.
nuring, limited extent of soil under cultivation,
and an increase of care to effect (
this. We havcall encouragement to per- f
severe, when we reflect upon what has J j
resulted from the formation of Agricultu l(
ra I Associations. We can tell of crops ^
augmented in our own state as follows:

In New York we have authenticated j (
j reports of 53 bushels of wheat, 58 barley, j <
| 50 peas, 135 corn, 750 potatoes, and 5 t

ir u/nnU ill liecoine me to advcntqre in- <
I struction to men who have long been con- <
versant with the cultivation of tne soil, i
from their habits of labor, or the deep per- I
sonal interest which they have in the i
land which they possess. But it improper 1
that I should endeavor to call up a more I
general attention to the pursuits of tho I
farmer. Here, in our cities and large j
towns, there are errors in the public inind, I
strong prejudices, unconcealed contempt, i
and above all, tiie most unfortunate ig- '
iterance. I
I am not in danger of contradiction j <
when I declare, that our community has J <
regarded money as the chief good, and its
accumulation has been practically regar- i
led as the chief end of man. All the occupation
and the energy of life have
gone out in this direction. To till the
ground has been thought disreputable, I
magine, very principally, because its
>rofils have been thought to be slow in
heir return; there have been no wonderul
fortunes made in a few months?no
bod for that preternatural restlessness
vhicHcupidity has revelled in. What a
rightful conspiracy there has hern going

>est way of getting rich without labor;
ind such was the ingenuity of this city,
hat in one year we made property grow
unety-two millions!
Rut in accounting for this popular disaste,
let me be more particular. I beieve
that parents have had much to do in

endered them happy, prosperous and repectable.
No matter how many children
hey have, the sons are to do with as
ittle labor as may be, and the daughters
re to he lilies, they are neither to toil or
pin. How many a parent would feel
ihsolutely insulted if you supposed that
ic intended to put his boy to actual labor
if any sort! When parents and children
:oine to the conclusion that the lad must
ibtain his living bv some exertion of his
ovn, they put their minds to the rack, tc
liscover a way in which it can be done
vitbout labor. The father perhaps, has
nade every cent he possesses by toil, yet,
mder the influence of the dav in which
ve live, he cannot endure the idea thai
lis son should be seen in a laboring dress,
mgaged in a mechanical or agricultura
imployment. When will men see the
blly of the opinion, that the youth whe
ubors on a farm or works in a shop, car
>o-fit else! A young man
ipon a farm may qualify himsell not only
o pursuo his calling, hut to take a part in
ill the public concerns of hie.
It is idle to talk of the want of tiini
>r the means for mental cultivation upvi
in American farm. Judge Buel wasoor
eet when lie declared that a man might
levoie throe hours out of twenlydbur tr
itudy. without infringing upon his busiless,
fatiguing his mint!, or impairing his

WORN OUT LANDS.
Loo. IIALL, Feb. IS 12.
s Mr. Thomas ajficck:
Dear Sir:?I will endeavor to give
i vou the plan pursued by farmer* where
I was raised, to reati i'tate worn-out
lands, or even to improve the tried, or
the, to appearances, naturally thin land;
in so doing, will throw in mv own notions,
thereby striving to give you as fully as
I \ nm ?h!?> or na mpirtnru Itlft. the
capabilities of the youth for improvement,
without any foieign aid. In doing so, I
think I can convince you, that our resources
arc ample; that our means are
competent, if we only had the energy to
pursue, the information well matured to
direct, and a few competent to the task to
lead in this good cause of reform. Tno
difficulty at present m our country is almost
insufferable ; but I trust that time
will overcome all difficulties. As a general
rule, those who have the capital to farm,
don't believe a word in your Berkshircs,
Durhams, South Downs, deep and fine
culture manure, rotation of crop*, pr? viding
for stock of any description; give
them bacon, corn bread, a few c I ards,
and turnips in the shape nearly of a bottle,
milk sometimes, coffee, big crops of cotton.
and enough corn?they are content
( ?the name of any thing like improvement,
isanothcr multicaulis storv. Those
' who have the energy and zeal, are (too
much the case, I regret from my soul,)
tied down bv debts, that preclude all pos1
sibility to improve, unless in a very limi1
ted extent; therefore you must not look
for very rapid improvement amongu*.
We have here generally what may be
called a la-ge number of cattle on our
farms, in comparison with the North, As
1 the most of us do not feed either summer
' ? ? - -- * ? I I ct? nnr
' or wiiiiur9 iiiuiciviv & if tf
' means are more ample to collect and
> make manure, especially those of us who
5 live in a woodland country, or near a
1 swamp. By collecting leaves, swamp
earth, corn stalks, &r. in our cow lots
1 herd our cattle regular, even provide food
t for winter feed, our resources in this way
? you will understand.
I Our cotton send lu another fruitfu
5 source of providing the finest material foi
1 manuring either corn, oats, or 1 all, cot
1 ton: a double handful on a lull *of corn
!. will, in ordinary seasons, be more than
' equal to, I think, four times the amount of
1 any other kind of manure we use. Wkik
some prefer pulting around corn after i
is out of the ground; others prefer de posi
i ting in the furrow?ilio hitter 1 prefer
' For oats, I have scattered it on the grouiu
and plowed in with oats?and although
' have never desirrgedly manured cotton
' with the seed, yet ail of us have soon cor.
ton that grew where the seed had manur
' ed, and I have always noticed the plants
1 there, greener, fuller of bowls, and larger
1 than any where else. I can show spots
1 where the seed were deposited three
1 year3 ago, and venture to predict, (tho:
1 two crops of oats have grown since?the
corn crop was manured) that the ne.xl
: crop of cotton, will tell in those very spots
' my reason for particularly naming this is
" some of mv brethren contend that seedr
are temporary in their effects.
Another source of manure?superior
to your boaste I fields of clover too?if w<
1 would only put our shoulders to the whee
1 ?is the cow pea. We can make a full
crop of corn, and on the same land, a croj
nf row ueas: nlant the pea about the
I ' # ?
P time of 44 laying bye" our corn; work
once; plant, if in hills, between th<
rows one way?if in drills in the middle
of row?and at a proper time, cut corn tr
the ground, when fit haul in; and aftei
1 the pea has pretty well matured, turn
hogs in, they will eat the pea, then turr
* all the vine in ; we can have on gooi
' land as mucfj vine as we can turn under.
1 One advantage in the pea, if Vr<? pursue
a rotation, of cotton, corn, oats, cotton ?
is the pea can be plowed in the second
year, in the rotation, and by sowing oats
in the 9pring, with about one bushel ol
the pea to three acres, after the oats are
cut, the pea will cover the whole land
then plowjn, the third year of rotation
?whereas you plow in clover only when
three years old, or two at farthest?we
can feed our pea every year in a limitet
^ evtent, and yet plow it in, in the fall, il
' being tap rooted is on additir i al advan[
tnge. The cotton crop can be made tc
aid in this matter. About the middle 01
even first of September, sow cotton fields
down in rye?(I have seen it) after gath
' ering cotton crop, give stock the chancf
of eating it down; in the spring, thrash
down all ordinary size stalks,) plow in lh<
green rye and stalks; or oats will do !t
well; I would prefer the Egyptian oat, bu
I believe the black out will stand our win
ters generally.
We have yet another adjuvant?crat
grass; where it has a chance, it will covei
the entire surface, not only affording f
valuable grass for grazing or curing, b i
1 a large quantity of matter, if turned under
to the soil for manure.
I hesitate not to advise my friends ii
the South, to plant oats and peas togeth
* f er. I have done it, and speak from ex
