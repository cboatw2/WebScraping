and somewhat sceptical on the subject,
I have seen nothing for a long time which
promises somuch as the late discovery ofM,
Concherie in France; and nothing out ol
which Yankees will be so likely to draw
profit for themselves and their country,
Jt may be hoped, that this discovery wil
be widely circulated.
Wood is one of the great staples ir
New.England; its value has been hereto
fore increased, onlv by mechanical skill:
hut now, by the aid of a man of true sci
ence, its value, its durability and its ap
plication, are likely to be extended fai
beyond any farmer conception. Mr,
Boucheric's discovery, although resting or
sciehoe, is so simple and plain, that thost
least conversant with the philosophy o
vegetation w ill understand it at once, anr
be convinced of its truth. It is wel
known, that various expcnmruis uav?

even inctm'mstible. impregnating it will
common salt, or mctalic salts. But tin
difficult has been, to so impregnate dr\
wood Mr. Bonchiere has avoided tha
difficulty, by penetrating the wood whili
yet alive. He says, " Let a tree be cu
otTat the foot, and that foot placed in *
vessel containing the conversative liquor
with which you would saturate it, ant
then the aspiratorv effect of the leaves wil
cause this liquor to ascend with the sap.
" Or that the tree may he notched, or par
tly sawed in two: or it may be felled
even leaving a tuft of leaves sufficient t<
perform the aspiration upwards, and th<
liquor will pervade the smallest twigs, an<
even the leaves."

wood from dry or wet rot; a matter o
sufficient importance in itself, for shij

ft is well known to farmers, and gardeners,
that salt, put round the roots of a
living tree will kill it, salt in large quan
tities is poison for a tree, and it is absorber
by the same process as the sap is. anc
with it; as poison is taken into the blooc
of live animals, although it cannot penet
rate the veins of a dead body, because there
is no circulation ; the respiratory action
of the lungs is wanting to make the blooc
circulate. Now the leaves are the?-res
piratdry organs &T the plant, and it musl
have some life to alworb anything.
The tree is pervaded ;.n all its part!
wi h small elongated cells, which com
?..jnicate with each other, through a nar
row passage in which there is, perhaps
an invisible valve, or some alternate construction,
and expansion doing the office
of a valve. Through this passage the sap
rises from cell to cell, till it reaches the
leaves?or the lungs of the plant, and
tfi'-n descends after undergoing a change;

i leen years. In thw adoption and prac'ice
, of the modern improvements in naval
warfare, we are far behind the science of
1 age,?and very far in the roar of England,
France, Russia, and even smaller powers.
- I When we came into conflict with Eng.
,! land on the ocean, during the last war, it
> I was under advantages of which modern
f *
5 j improvements in the art of naval warfare
I have in a great measure deprived us. Her
favorite class of ships, armed, as they
! confess, with what they had supposed to
f ho the most efficient calibre, we opposed
> with a heavier calibre, *ud an equal, and
5 {in some respects superior degree of seat
I manship. Our success in these engager;
men's was therefore, in general, all that
i we could desire. The English have, in
J consideration of these facts, adopted a
i i much heavier and greatly imoroved arII
rnament, as we shall presently show.
. ! The overwhelming superiority of Eng.
! land can only be encountered by other
i j powers, bv changes and .improvements
i which shall completely revolutionize .the
art of naval warfare. The French saw
I | this, even in the time of Napoleon, who
j was one of the first, according to Mr.
f Paixhans, who struck the great idea of
producing and applying a species of artil.
lerv that no ship of the line, (which is,
i after all, a frail edifice of wood,) can re1
cut ,
I . Within the last ten years, the ideas of
I Mr. Paixhans have been adopted in the
1 French and English service, and these
O 1 ^
j two nations have vied with each other in
> i giving the fullest scope to those new npi
j plications of science, the shock of which
I j is, ere long, to bo felt throughout the
| world, and which are destined, it may he,
t ! to put an end to the despotism of England
j over the sea.
i j It is found that, without increasing the
I weight of the guns, or the difficulty of
i managing them, Ao/Zo/r projectiles of heavy
? j calibre can he fired with terrific effect,
j and Bomb cannon of tremendous size may
> i he used on ship-board, so as to throw a
> | large bomb horizontally' with assure an
' , aim as th6 solid shot from an ordinary
I | cannon. Large bomb? even of the calibre
I j of one hundred and fifty or two hundred
,r | poilnds, are fired on ship-board, or from
,r stationary batteries, with the force and
' ptecision of a cannon ball. No struc
j lures eitiier of stone or wood ran resisi
I ; such artillery. The terrible efficiency of
' this ann (the Paxihans cannon,) was wit
! nessed at Bey root, St. Jean i> Acre, and
" : at San Juan do Ulloa. Mr. Paixhans. ir:
; his work on "new maritime artiilj y,"
5; says, in regard to the destructive clfcct i
I ! of these bombs on vessels,-"When thrown
! horizontally, they will crush, strike to
: j pieces, and tear open, tiie side 01 ine vr-^.
1 st*I, with a terrible shock. It* thcv re.
main in the side their explosion, acting
| like a mine, will open largo breaches, the
irregular fractures of which, extending
below the water line, will make a passage,
I j through which the water will rush in, as
? though a dyke were suddenly broken. If
' a bomb should enter a a mast, it will over'
turn, it, together with its yards, top and
' rigging. Should the hornb pass entirely
? , through the ship's side, then they will
r produce their effects between decks, in
T ! the midst of the combatants, the artil.ery
1 I and munitions; and they will scatter

2 j volumes of smoke and flame; I hoy will
i completely destroy s fabrick of wood,
! much more easily than one of stone ? they
' will rip up the deck, set every thing on

j where."
' | As if all this was not enough, each
bomb contains a Gorman composition o'

- J used to poison tie galleries of mines, and
r as an able reviewer of this subject tells
us, is "truly a pestilent congregation of
2 j vapors," rendering a ship uniniial itable.
I > It is enough to damp the ardor of the
r i loftiest chivalry to contemplate this last
. j "notivellc armeand noth r.g can he beti
i ter calculated to bring war into disrepute.
1 j In truth, however, all improvements in
r the art of war lesson its dcstructiveness
2 and frequency.
i If tioinor ascertained that there was no
I " f ?
more difficulty in carrying or fighting a
1 battery of bomb cannon than any other,
1 the next stop was, to connect this new
'armament with Steam navigation. That
, it will answer as well tor a cruize as for
I'coast defence, is the opinion of many
5 scientific men, and has been partially test.
: ed hy experience. Its applicability to
| attacks on fortified places has been swffiM
cienilv tested ; and for sea coast defence
>' it can have no parallel in efficiency, or in
J j economy. It is peculiarly well adapted,
in this respect, to our service, and it has,
. in some degree, forced itself upon the at- j
> j tcntion of our government.
j Capt. Ross, in his work on steam de- j
- fence, says, 'the destiny of Gr'at Britain
may be involved in this invention."?
* * * "The system will, in fact, become
a species of military, instead of a na
val one; and they who should have been
sailors, will be maritime soldiers, not seamen;
and then will our superiority, as far j
as depends on seamanship, disappear; or
we shall become what they will he, and
ian; t learn to meet them on oar own

coasting and foreign trade. But we shall
gain in another respect?the resources of
the interior river navigation will give us,
thousands of hardy and daring men. whc
arc accustomed to service in steam vessels,
though they would be out of their
element in an ordinary sailing vessel?
Straw Jlolillas armed with Paixhans guns'
or the Stephens gun, should it be prefered,
throwing explosive shot of heavy calibre,
arc obviously the best means of defending
our coast and preserving our cities from
fire and pillage. No fleet, of whatever
| force, of the old kind, could maintain a
position on our coast, or blockade our
ports, if we were thus prepared. But
suppose England, or any other naval pow.
er, assails us with steam fleets, then there
is the greatest reason why we should meet
them in the same manner. Our fortifications
will he almost useless, unless armed
with bomb cannon, so that.thev may sufficiently
resist the approach of a hostile
steam fleet In point of economy, the
j steam flotilla will have a grand advantage
J over ordinary sailing vessels; for they
I will cost less for construction and hrmamen!,
and still less in men, provisions and
munitions,?while they give a greater degree
of efficiency.
A few war steamers have already been
built or ordered to be built by Congress,
?and, we trust, their number is speedily
! it\ !,/? i nfPPn?P(l_ We learn that Mr. Rhodes,
a most skilful naval architect, has been invited
to superintend the building of one of
them, and that he will probably undertake
it, provided the Board of Navy Commissioners
shall not interfere with the work.
It is the general opinion, both of landsmen
and seamen, that the first thins to be
* ' D
done, in order to render the Navy, as the
President says, ''replete with efficiency,"
is to abolish the Board of Navy Commissioners.
It has been a common remark, of late,
that, if t he United States get into a war
(which may Heaven avert,) they will be
well whipped for the first year or two, and
then pay it back with interest. But if
unfortunately! war should come, why not
avoid the preliminary whipping, by timely
preparation, and repulse the enemy at
j first as well as at last,?be fore our coast is
ravaged, and towns burnt, and resources
impaired,? as well after?

which has so unexpectedly removed (fenera!
Harrison from the hopes of the Am

hasten also to offer up its vows. Mr. President,
that your Administration may be
i distinguished by the maintenance of all
the existing friendly relations, and by ?
constant increase in the prosperity of the
United States.
The Diplomatic Corps embraces this
opportunity, Mr. President, to assure you
of its earnest desires to merit your confi.
dence and esteem.

Mr. Minister : In my character of
Chief Magistrate of the United States,
and in the name of the People thereof, I
have to return to the Diplomatic Corp?i,
whom on this occasion you represent, mv
acknowledgments for their expression of
condolence on account of the bereave,
ment which this country has so recently
sustained in the death of its late lamented
and illustrious President. I take occasion,
j at the same time, to give the assurance
that mv most earnest desire, as hi.sconsti#
1
tutional s accessor, will be to maintain and
cherish the friendly relations which now
so happily subsist between our respective

The People of the United States regard
their own prosperity aa intimately connecUd

West India Trade.?Under various
systems, which some term reciprocal, the
West India Trade has so changed in the
last thirty.five years that there i9 not, it
would seem, a tithe of the business done
now that there was in 1905. A cor res-!
pondent of the Star says he took up a copy
of the New York Gazette for 1805, and
found its columns filled with advertisements
notifying ?the sailing of vessels for
ev ^rv part of the West Indies." I was
: induced to compare the number of said
advertisements in 1805 with a paper of
, April, 1841. I found .35 in the old paper,
|and 3 in the latter. What a falling off,
| thought [, In this important trade, once so
profitable to the New York merchants!?
New Y'rk Express.
The facts here stated are sufficiently
interesting, as facts, to justify the calling
of public attention to them. But the inference
would hardly hold good that our
commercial intercourse with the West In.
dia islands had fallen off in the same pro.
portion. In 1805, Great Britain and
France, by their reciprocal blockades,
having in a great measure cut off direct'
trade between the United States and both
those cojntries, the West India islands
became the ontrepots of a great proportion
of the trade between the United States
and thw? great markets for our produce.
Is not this the true explanation of the
great apparent extent of intercourse with
I the Wet t Indies at that time ?

PHENOMENA AT TIIE NOUTII POLE;
FROM A LATE ENGLISH PAPER.
A St; Petersburg periodical, Le Journal
Scicntifique.y el Lileraire, publishes a very
extraordinary narrative of an expedition
to tho Arctic region, under the command
of M. Nidjnei Nitigoiwosnescnk. The
narrative says:
About the 88th degree of latitude
yielded as one of the most curious di*.
i j .i- - -i : i
J coveries that havo enricuea me puy*n;ai
j sciences in latter times. It occured thus:
; For some days we had made no fire for
want of wood, when, in searching our box
j of provisions. 1 found some Lyons chest!
uts whic h M. Arago had sent me as a
souvrewr. I took it into my head to roast,
them. YVe nut together some shavings
which we still had, and kindled them.
. A bright flame forthwith arose, and we
! were anticipating the sweet sensations it
wasnl-ou* to yield us, when suddenly an
incomprehensible phenomenon manifested
itself. The flame, at first so bright
and crackling seertied struck with immobility,
and was gradually covered with a
solid crust?it was congealed!
" Our astonishment baffles description.
(A scientific description of the ice thus
produced then follows.) I broke a
bit of it and put it into my mouth. Contrary
to my expectation, the sensation
which resulted was most agreeable ; just
fancy a little (aste of barley sugar extremelv
refreshing, though accompanied
bv a 'light burnt smell. I am persuaded
that when such ice shall be produced by
artificial means, confectioners will turn it
to great account.
" A little further on another phenomenon,
not less remarkable, awaited us. We
had for some time perceived an increased
rapidity in the progress of our sledge,
though we used our iron hooks hut little*.
The phenomenon was soon explained ;
- - . .1
one of us having dropped his hook,tne
moment he attempted to pick it up we
saw it gradually romove from us, flco before
us, and ultimately whiz as it split the
dense atmosphere around us. Though
already accustomed to the wonders which
those mysterious regions had presented to
us, as it were, at every step, we stood
mute with astonishment, but were soon
roused from our amazemeDt; our sledge,
which is almost wholly made of iron, t<
seemed pushed on by a fatal, irresistible, a
and invincible power, such as that which
draws n light boat towards a cataract; J
we tried to stop it, but could sot succeed {
and were compelled to leave it to the [,
mercy of Heaven. j
" The magnetic power of the pole producedita
effect, and, after a few hours of ?
that fantastic progress, we were enabled J
to perceive, by the light of an aurora borealis,
the 9orabre mysterious extremity of
our globe. It consisted of enormous *
mountains probably of pure loadstone, di- 1
vided into huge strata of various colors, i
green or blue. One would have fancied t
the back of a gigantic zebra was rising be- I
fore us. Alas! unless Providence vouch- (
safed us unhoped-for assistance, we must j
soon be dashed to pieces against it. Im- (
pelled by the proud demon of science, we ,
had tempted Heaven, and already did we |
feel its hand suspended over our heads {
ready to crush us.
" Nevertheless, thus isolated in that
vast frozen solitude, and fatally dragged
to destruction, we were calm and resigned,
so great is the power of the grand mysteries
of Nature over man ! Some tears on- 1
ly flowed in silence, and I heard beloved 1
names uttered, when suddenly, a sort of
barrier of icebergs, heaped over one another,
made us deviate from our course, and
at the same moment, and in a few seconds,
a force as powerful as that which had '
made us before devour space in front of us
made us roughly recede. We were just
j fallen into a negative magnetic current. 1
I We were saved jand saved to carry away 1
! with us the most awful secret of Nature.
| It was enough to run mbd with joy. We 1
i raised our hands.to Heaven."
the scottish thistle. i
The origin of this ancient emblem of 1
Scottish pugnacity, is thus handed down
by tradition ;?When the Danes invaded
Scotland, it was deemed unwarlike to attack
an enemy in the. pitch, darkness of
night, instead of a pitched battle by day :
but on one occasion the invaders resolved
to avail themselves of this stratagem ; and
in order to prevent their tramp from being
heard, marched barefooted. They
had thus neared the Scottish force unobserved,
when a Dane unluckily stepped
with his nakedjfoot upon a'uiperbly prickly
thistle, and instinctively uttered aery of .
pain, which discovered the assault to the
Scots, who ran to their arms, and defeated
the foe with a terrible slaughter.?The
thistle was immediately adopted as the in-'
signia of Scotland.
New York, April 24, half past 3 P. M.
The Great Western, always punctual
to her time of arrival, made her appearance
in our harbor between one and two
o'clock, bri? ging late news from England
and the Continent, hut nothing of much
importance.
The President steamer, twenty-seven
days from Now York, had not arrived at
Liverpool when the Great Western
left.
The last inteiigence from the United)
States in England was to the 20th of i
March?the North American, which
sailed on that day, having arrived on the
I 4rh. She earned out the Proclamation
I of the President for an Extra session ox j
Congress, and the scenes of the Specia i
Session of the Senate, which c'osed o
wthe loth of. March?the p,T-ct of which,
j if any tiling, was favorable.
The imprisonment of McLsod has nl-1
| most ceased to he a subject of serious com- j
i ment in the English newspapers, and, so j
j far as the public voice is heard, it seems j
j to he for continued peace. The political !
inteligenco from the East is unimportant. '
Erom all parts of the continent the news'j
is later, hut I see nothing, in hasty read- j
ing, which can be regarded as of the I
h c? |
least importance. The over-land mail,
had not arrived..
The comnjorcialjinteligence, being but!
four days later than received bv the Co- j
i lumbia at Boston, is no' important. The i
cotton market was dull, but no change J
in prices. The Havre Prices Current i

A Question of Veracity,?It may he remembered
that Lord Palmerston, some
time a go, on the Hoor of the House
of Commons, declared that the assump.

j the Caroline had been officially made
j known to the Government of the United
j States, through Mr. Stevenson, in refer,
ance to this declaration the London Times
i makes the statements following:?
We arc anxious to enforce the expediv*
ncy of getting at the truth of the rumor
which has been accredited in the best
rtCvi'lii/*), wr see no
informed circie?, nuu
reason to doubt the truth?namely, that
within a day or two Lord Palmcrston as.

son of the British Government having !

j the American Minister, Mr. Stevenson

British Foreign Secretary, positively nllonging
that his Lordship had stated what
was not the fact, for that the American

Government had never yet had such a
communication from any official function,

MORE FORGERIES.
We published yesterday an account of
i bold and successful forgery, by which
the Commercial Bank of Cincinnatti and
Mr. Gwathmey of Louisville, were each
swindled out of $16,000. The same
trick has been played in this city, and
with the like success. A few days since,
the following letter was received at the
Bank of America, covering the half of
what purported to be a certificate of deposite
of $23,000 in specie in the Commercial
Bank of New-Orleans.
Commercial Bask of Nkw-Oblrani, ) ?
A/arch 17,1841. ) m
D. Thompson, Esq.,
Cashier Bank of America, New-Yerk.
Dear Sir?In conformity with the request
of Nathaniel Britton, Esq., of London,
I hand you enclosed half my certificate
of deposite in his favor, for $23,000
specie, which please deliver to him on
presentation of the first half.
Mr. Britton is unacquainted in your
city, and has adopted this course for
safety and identity.
I recommend him to your favor.
Yours respectfully,
GEO. O. HALL, Cashier.
The above letter is an exact copy of,
the one received at Cincinnatti, with the
substitution of the name of Nathl. Britton
for'that of W. M. Parker, and $23,000
for $13 000.
On Thursday of the last week the "Mr. >
Britton" of the letter made his appearance,
received of the Cashier of the Bank
of America the other half of the certificate
of depoeite, and was by him introduced
to Jacob Little A: Co., who cashed
the certificate by a check on the Union
Bank. On presenting this at the counter
of the bank payment was refused until
thn tr?11pf should be satisfied that the pre
sinter was the person in whose favor the
check was drawn. He then went to Mr.
Little and finding him engaged, from
thence to Mr. Thompson, who accompanied
him to the hank, certified to his
identity, and the money was paid.
Mr. Little has offered a reward of
?5.000 for the recovery of the money,
v ; ?
and a proportionate sum lor any part
thereof.
From the following paragraph in the
Philadelphia United States Gazette of
yesterday, it appears that a like attempt
with the foregoing has been made at
Philadelphia, but not with the like result:
We gave the particulars yesterday of a
most ingenious, extensive and successful
forgery on a Bank in Cincinnati. We
now learn that a similar attempt was
made on the Girard Bank in this city,
hut without success. So exact is the
imitation of the writing, the engraving,
and signatures of the drafts, and even the
letters, that on comparison no difference
is observable. Even the color of the ink
on the counterfeit is the same as that on
those known to be genuine. The trick
did not take here.
A similar attempt was also made at
Baltimore, but it was not successful, merely,
according to the correspondent of theCourier,
because the holder "was too close
in driving a bargain."
O O
What adds to the mystery of these forgeries
is the fact?for fact is beyond alt
r?acnn?hlp Houht?that the letter con
taining the halfcerfifiicate to Mr. Thompson,
mint not only have been written in
the Bank at New-Orleans, but it must
have been written by the hand that is
employed to copy the letters in the original
correspondence of Mr. Hall, the cashier.
Nor is this ail: the letter introducing
the pretended Mr. Rritton, bears the genuine
signature of Mr. Hall, the cashier
Two kinds of ink used also in the correspondence
of Mr. Hall, were used in tho
spurious letter?both kinds being of the
exact shade of the genuine letters of Mr.
Hall. We have arrived at these conclusions
on a close comparison of the spurious
with the genuine letters of Mr. Hall,
in company with several excellent judge*
in such matters, whose opinions coincide
"With our own. ^
MORE OF THE FORGER.
It is stated by a correspondent of the
I Louisville Journal, writing from Cincinnati,
that about the same time at which
the fraud of the (prged certificate of dcposit
e was successfully played off on the
Commercial Bank of Cincinnati, a like
attempt was made with the same object
on the Northern Bank of Kentucky, at
Covington. The cashier of the last
named bank received a letter containing
the duplicate of a certificate of deposite
?11 nan ;n anwip. from the Mer
lor wn,vu" ??

the game W. M. Parker. Mr. Parker
