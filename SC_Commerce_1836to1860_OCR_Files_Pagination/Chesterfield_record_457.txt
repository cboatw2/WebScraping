Ax Agreeable Threat.
\ y.cm,r lai>orcr, who had been abroad
to work, was wearily drudging home,
and had not gained more than half the
distinct when he was overtaben by the
squire of his villiage in a handsome
chaise. He reigned in and charged John,
ny with pilfering his fire wood, and among
otb* r hard things, he saiu "you rascal, I'll
take you up!"
"Ten thousand thanks to your honor!"
cried the other, springing forward and
thrusti ng his foot in the step of the vehicle
"ten thousand thanks to you, for I was
just a thinking how I should ever get home
so tired as lam, and night coming on."
The squire was so tickled with John's
smartness, that he not only gave him a
seat beside him in the chaise, but on the
next day sent him a load of wood into
bargain.

The object of the course of instruction will

mode of teaching will be the inductive, pro.
