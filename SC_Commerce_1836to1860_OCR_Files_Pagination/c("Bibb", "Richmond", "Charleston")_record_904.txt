■
BISHOP ASBURY AND PUNCH.
Zion’s Herald makes a clever editorial article
out of a communication published a few years
since in the Southern Christian Advocate and
furnished by one of the Missionaries of the So.
Ca. Conference. We have been refreshed in
seeing the gem once more, albeit it glitters in a
Boston, abolitionist newspaper. None of our
readers will object to perusing the narrative once
more.
One of the greatest misfortunes of our denomi
national literature is, that we have no biography
of Bishop Asbury. What a life was his! What
a delineation would his history be 1 And yet it
* is not the great deeds of that great man—his vast
journeying, incessant preaching, and executive
plans—that illustrate fully his character. He
that would write a genuine biography of Asbury,
must gather from all the widespread country the
many incidents of his more personal life, the an
ecdotes and sayings that exhibit characteristically
• the man.
One of these, an affecting fact in itself, as well
as an illustration of the Bishop’s character, oc
curred in 1788, on his journey to Charleston,
S. C. He passed a creek in the parish of
St.———, on Jthe branch of which stood a slave,
fishing. His name was Punch ; he was notori
ous for his vicious character. The good Bishop
riding towards him, bethought himself that un
der that squalid exterior lived an immortal spir
it for whom Christ died, and the salvation of
which would be to him a higher achievement
than the conquest of the world. Such were fa
miliar thoughts to that great mind. He stopped
his horse and entered into conversation with
him.
“Do you ever pray t my friend,” inquired the
Bishop.
“No sir,” replied Punch.
The Bishop deliberately proceeded to alight,
fasten his horse to a tree, and seat himself by the
side of the slave.
Punch was evidently astonished at the good
man’s conduct, but was relieved immediately by
the kindness of his tones. He commenced a
minute conversation with him on Religion, ex-_
plaining the nature and consequences of sin, the
atonement, repentance, justification by faith, the
certainty of death, the terrors of the judgment
and hell. The Bishop, earnest for the rescue of
this benighted but immortal spirit, warmed into
exhortation and entreaty. Punch soon began to
feel; tears ran down his sable cheeks; he seemed
deeply alarmed at his danger, and listened with
intentness to the counsels of the singular stran
ger. After a long conversation, the Bishop sang
the hymn,
"i'lungcu ill a guu oi uara despair,
prayed with him, and pursued his journey, doubt
less thinking of and prayjpg for the poor slave,
as he measured the miles of his tedious route.
More than twenty years elapsed before he
saw any thing of Punch. While on another
visit to Charleston, he was called upon by an
aged and Christian negro, who had obtained per
mission from his master to visit him, and had
travelled 70 miles on foot for the purpose. It
was the slave whom he had warned and prayed
over on the bank of the creek, and who had ever
since been journeying on the way to heaven.
What a lesson must this interview have taught
the apostolic Bishop 1 What an encouragement
to labor and pray for the salvation of souls un
der the most forbidding circumstances.
The Bishop had no sooner left Punch on the
bank of the stream, than the latter took up his
fishing tackle and hastened home in the deepest
agitation of mind, pondering the words of the
venerable man. The divine Spirit was opera
ting upon his dark mind: new light, now
thoughts, stirring the depths of the soul, had
dawned upou him. He endeavored to conform
to the instructions he had received, and when
some days of anguish and prayer had elapsed,
he found peace in believing, and became a new
man. The change was too manifest not to be
discerned by his fellow servants. It was the
topic of his conversation with them incessantly.
In his'simple way, he pointed them to the Lamb
of God which taketh away the sins of the world,
and though they lived at a time when' religious
instruction was rare among slaves, yet they com
prehended the novel tale, and many of them be
came thoroughly penitent for their sins, and gui
ded by the spirit of grace, found “the knowledge
of salvation by the remission of sins through faith
in Christ.” The interest extended from one to
another, and throngs of the neglected Africans at
last resorted to his humble cabin, his exhorta
tions and prayers. Several remarkable results
followed, one of which was the conversion of a
perverse overseer, who had charge of the plan
tation. This man,perceiving theincreasing inter
est of the slaves for their sou Is and their constant at
tendance in the evenings at Punch’s, determined to
put a stop to the spreading leaven. He forbid
Punch to hold social meetings among them. He
was therefore, confined in bis Christian labors tc
those who belonged to his own cabin, and a few im
mediately adjacent, who clandestinely met with
him when they could with safety. One evening
when the little band were praying together, the
Overseer’s voice was heard without, loudly cal
ling for Punch. They were all terrified, sue
pecting that he had discovered them, and wa:
summoning their devoted guide to a severe chas
tisement. Punch went out, when lo ! he found
the overseer on his knees, under a tree, alternate
ly supplicating the mercy of God and calling on
i the poor slave to pray for him. God’s spirit,
j probably through the example of the converted
I negroes, had got hold upon his conscience. His
| attempt to suppress their meetings could not sup
| press his convictions ; they deepened, and at last
overpowering him, led him to seek relief in pray
I er under the tree, and there they constrained him
1 to implore the sympathies and prayers of poor
j Punch. The negroes gathered around him,
and prayed with hirn till God in his mercy par
1 doned and comforted him. The overseer soon
i became a co-worker with Punch among them.
He joined the Methodist church, and in time be
i came an exhorter and finally a preacher !
Punch had now full liberty to dogood among
his associates; he exhorted,prayed, and led them
on as a shepherd of his flock, and extended his
usefulness around the whole neighborhood.
Many years after he was removed, by the decease
of his master and the distribution of the estate, to
the parish of A-, where he continued to la
bor for the salvation of his fellow bondsmen,
with even greater success. Scores and even hun
dreds were convened through his instrumentali
ty. He had a kind of pastoral charge of them
for years. The preacher from whom wre have
the particulars, was the first missionary that
found them out. He writes :—“in 1836, at the
special solicitation of planters of that section of
country, a missionary was sent to their planta
tions from the South Carolina Conference. I
was honored with the appointment. On my reach
ing the plantation where Punch lived, I found
between two and three hundred persons under his
spiritual supervision, who had been gathered in
to a kind ofsociety, many of whom, upon further
acquaintance, I found to be truly pious and
consistent. I was much interested on my first
visit to the. old veterun. Just before I reached
his house, I met a herdsman, and asked him if
there was any preacher on the plantation. ‘O
yes, Massa, deold Bishup lib here!’ Said I,‘is
he a good preacher V ‘O yes,’was the reply,
‘he would burn we heart.’ He showed me the
house. I knocked at the door, and heard ap
proaching footsteps, nnd the sound of a cane up
on the floor. T^e door opened, and I saw be
: fore me, leaning upon a staff, a hoary-headed
black man, with palsied limbs, but a smiling face.
He looked at me for a moment in silence; then
raising his eyes to heaven, he said, ‘Now Lord,
lettest thou thy servant depart in peace,for mine
eyes have seen thy salvation V I was confused.
He asked me to take a seat, and I found in the
following remarksthe reason of his exclamation.
Said he—‘I have many children in this place.
I have felt for some time past that my end was
nigh. I have looked around to see who might
take my place when I am gone. 1 could find
none. 1 felt unwilling to die and leave them
so, and havo been praying to God to send some
one to take care of them. The Lord has sent
you, my child ; L am ready to go.’ Tears cour
sed freely down his time-shrivelled, yet smiling
face, I was overwhelmed.
•• i ms interview gave me muon encourage
ment. He had heard of the application for n
missionary, and only wanted to live long enough
to see his face.—After this I had several inter
views with him, from winch 1 learned his early
history. I always found him contented and hap
py. In the lapse of a short time afterwards, he
was taken ill and lingered a few days. On Sab
bath morning he told me he should die that day.
He addressed affecting words to the people who
crowded around his dying bed. The burden of
his remarks, the theme of his soul, was, ‘Now,
Lord, lettest thou thy servant depart in' peace !’
He applied these words to himself, and contin
ued his address to the last moment; and death
gently stole his spirit away while saying, ‘Let
thy servant depart in peace—let—let—le !’
“His mistress sent lor ine to preach his funeral
sermon. The corpse was decently shrouded,
iand the coffin was carried to the house of wor
ship. I looked upon the face of the cold clay.
The departed spirit had left the impress of hea
ven upon it. Could I be at n loss for a text? I
read out of the gospel, ‘Now, Lord, lettest thou
thy servant depart in peace.’”
Blessed be God for the saving power of his
word and spirit. This poor negro, vicious and
ignorant, appealed to by a passing ambassador
ol Christ, is pierced to the heart, and without sub
sequent guidance from man, becomes, by the re
! newal of the Holy Ghost, a child of God, nn
[heir of glory—the instrument of the conversion
[ of his persecutor, and the spiritual guide of hun
dreds of African converts, and goes up at last in 1
j glorious ascension to the “heavenly Jerusalem,”
“the innumerable company of angels.”
And wbat an example does this incident fur
nish to the messengers of salvation ! Many
would probably have passtd«by the benighted
bondman at the brook, as did the Priest and Le
vite the wounded man on the way to Jericho.
But the human spirit, habited in rags and deform
ed by ignorance and vice, is as valuable iu the
estimation of angels as when clothed with tbe re
galia of a throne, and such should be its estima
tion by all Christ’s ministers. Hence, then,
should they be instant in season and out of sea
son, becoming all things to all men, that they
may save some. The art of usefulness is a stri
king illustration of Asbury’s character, a high
er certificate of his apostleship than could be the
loftiest abilities of the pulpit, or the most pomp
ous imposition of prelatical hands. Who can
doubt, that in heaven it will be signalized for its
results more than any of those polemical displays
or powers of ecclesiastical leadership, which pro
cure the fame of greatness on earth? If I ever
reach that better world, I expetft to see this great
est of modern Bishops walking tho golden
streets with the redeemed slave by his side, his
noblest trophy.

THE REV. JAMES BUNDY.
The Life of Mr. James Bundy, a Wesleyan
Local Preacher, and a very useful man, is one
of the most interesting works of Wesleyan Bi
ography published. The following sketch, which
we have taken, will give some idea of the man:
Extract from the Life of Mr. Jas. Bundy, Bristol.
BY T. WOOD, A. M.
He wos born at Dymock, near the Forest o<
Dean, Hertfordshire; he was brought up by poor,
yet religious parents, and, at an early age, ha was
obliged to maintain himself. He was convinced
of sin, and obtained pardoning mercy when
young. He married a pious woman, and had
several children. FJo became a foreman at a
brewery in Bristol, and his duty was to see those
under him in their proper station: when he had
done this, he usually retired to some secret place,
and there entreated the blessing 0f God on him
self and the other men, especially that no acci
dent might happen during the day, so that his
master used to say, “ His casks were all blessed ;
for he believed his man, Bundy, had prayed be
hind every one of them.” He had property left
him by his master, and others, but he would not
accept it, and said, “ It should never be said that
he received money by praying for people.”
After a while, he engaged in business for himself,
as a brewer, and was conspicuous as a man of
business and as a public character in the religious
world. He held a prayer meeting in his own
house, and was assisted by that faithful minister
of Christ, the late Rev. Joseph Easterbrook,
vicar of Temple, and they lived on terms of
intimate friendship. Mr. Wesley, coming to
Bristol, he appointed Mr. B. to the office of
Class-leader, and he continued so to the end of
I his life. He afterwards became a Local Preach
■ er, and was made very useful in convincing sin
j ners of their folly. He preached on Clifton
Down, in consequence of a military band being
placed there on Sunday evenings: when his
friends began singing, the Commander ordered
the band to overpower their voices, but they could
not; he had preached at that time as he had
never done before—in such an awful manner
that several felt the truth of his remarks, and
became pious. The Commander died the day
after; while dressing for a visit, he dropped
down, and instantly expired. One Lord’s Day,
when Mr. B. was preaching at Durham Down,
Sir E. Williams, well known to him, drove up
in his carriage-and-four. He stayed the whole
time of the sermon, and, when concluded, bowed
and thanked Mr. B., entreating him to take a
seat in his carriage, and return with him to his
habitation: this, however, he declined. Sir
Edward was never known to qse his coach-hor
ses again on the Sabbath. Several times after
this, he requested Mr. B. to preach at his man
sion, to his family and numerous domestics, with
which he cheerfully complied.—On hearing that
many young persons bad agreed to meet at
Retland Green tor dancing and merriment, he
went, with a few friends, and, while singing a
hymn, was much annoyed by his juvenile throng;
however, he persisted, and one person was truly
awakened, and became decidedly pious. As a
preacher, he was diligent and punctual, and nev
er shrunk from toil, walking 10, 20, or 30 miles
a day to preach the everlasting Gospel; no in
disposition, or any earthly things, could prevent
him attending his appointment. He was a great
advocate for out-door preaching; his was plain and
faithful.—He was conspicuous for preaching,
not only in the pulpit, or streets, or highways,
out also :n prisons, where he was the means of
much good ; he had an uncontrolled access to
the prisoners, and devoted a large portion oftime
to their religious instruction. The distresses of
the prisoners often produced distressing and pain
ful feelings, so that, after having visited New
gate, (Bristol) sometimes he lost all relish for
food. He was very anxious about those who
were condemned to die, and has been the means
of several going to the scaffold rejoicing in God
their Saviour. After attending to business all
day, he would, with pleasure, leave his family,
and spend the whole or part of the night in the
cell of a felon. When any of his family cau
tioned him to take care of his health, he would
say, “I am to be careful about nothing ; for, as
my day is, so shall my strength .be. Where is
the use of having a body, if I do not spend and
wear it out in the service of God ? Hearing
that several prisoners in Newgate, London, were
under sentence of death, and being informed that,
if certain measures were adopted, their lives
would be saved, in order to rescue them, he
went to town, and fully succeeded in accomplish
ingtheir deliverance. In London healwa^sobtain
ed permission to visit the prisons.—The last year
before his death, age and infirmity coming ra
pidly upon him, he resolved once more to visit
the prisons of the metropolis, though he was
very unwell at the' time. He found 30 felons
under the sentence of death, playing at ball: he
expressed to them his surprise. “Why," they
answered, “no one cares for our souls.” “Yes,”
said he, “I care for your souls; and have come
120 miles to see you." One of them immedi
ately exclaimed, “Here Jack, is a'man who has
come 120 miles to see us ! come and hear what
he has to say.” They came to him, and he talk
ed with them: their attention was soon fixed;
their hearts were softened, and their tears soon
began to flow. On requesting his further attend
ance, he continued with them all night ; he visi
ted them in the course of the next day, and spent
another night with them ; and then left them,
under a deep concern for their salvation, com
mending them to the mercy of God. He saw
and spoke to upwards of 600 prisoners; and
though weak and indisposed of body, he per
formed the arduous task, not having taking off
his clothes, nor gone to bed, from the time he
left his own house to the night he returned. In
visiting the sick, Mr. B. had not many equals,
having visited upwards of 40,000 some of whose
cases were particularly interesting. He was a
decided enemy to superfluous dress and expen
sive luxuries, speaking against them, both in
public and private. When he saw persons in a
congregation he was addressing, decked in fine
apparel, he has been heard to say, “You come
and sit among the Lord’s people, but we know
to whom you belong. You come in with the
Devil’s flag about you, and show us that you
are not ashamed of him, nor of his livery. O
beware of every thing that would cheat you out
of your souls I” Persons afflicted either in body
or mind, hearing of his power in prayer, came
! from distant parts of the country to have an in
| terest in his prayers; and, it has been stated,
I were seldom disappointed. He extended his
views on this subject so far, that he thought it
criminal of a person, who enjoyed vital piety, to
apply to professional gentlemen for advice, espe
cially to one who did not fear God ; he thought
it more consistent to put trust in God than in
men.—He was requested to visit a family who
were in the deepest distress. On entering the
house in which the family lodged, lie was intro
duced into a dark, damp cellar, where he found
a man and his wife, with five small children.
The father had very little clothing, only a piece
of an old sack fastened round his body. The
woman lay on some straw on the floor, without
any kind of bed-clothes. The children were
crowded together close to little more than a hand
ful of fire, and they completely naked. The
poor woman groaned in the most piteous man
ner, and the whole presented a scene not to be
• described. Mr. B.’s attention was immediately
1 directed to the woman, as, from her appearance,
i he thought her dissolution very near. Not
a moment was to be lost; he instantly
spoke to her respecting her soul, and the
; necessity of a great and important change;
with other suitable advice; after which,
: he knelt down upon the straw, and while he was
pouring out his soul to Qod in her behalf, she
expired. The wretched husband appeared to be
stupified with grief, and almost insensible to the
awful scene before him. Mr. B. then spoke to
him, expressing his surprise that he was not
more alive to his situation. But, what was his
astonishment, when the poor man threw aside
the piece of old sack, and showed his breast,
which was eaten away with a cancer! he -then
gave a detail how he came in such a state. Mr.
B., by his humane exertions, extricated them
from their wretched situation Mr. Bundy was
never known to refuse one person an alms who
asked him, and never did he pass a distressed
person, solicited or unsolicited, without offering
some relief. He died, in the 68th year of his
age, on Good Friday, March 20, 1818, in the
glorious prospect of Heaven. His funeral was
attended by hundredsof the poor, and a hymn was
sung over the body at his own door, and another
as they passed Newgate Prison, and another as
| they passed Ebenezer Chapel. He was buried
I at Betland Chapel, thousands all the way attend
ing the remains of this blessed man of God. A
discourse was delivered over the grave, and the
whole was concluded by singing another hymn.
ADOPTION.
Adoption is an act by which one takes another
into his family, owns him for his son, and ap
points him his heir. The Greeks and Romans
had many regulations concerning adoption. It
does not appear that adoption, properly so called,
was formerly in use among the Jews. Moses
makes no mention of it in his laws; and the case
of Jacob’s two grandsons, Gen. xlviii, 14, seems
rather a substitution.
2. Adoption in a theological sense is that act
of God’s free grace by which, upon our being
justified by faith in Christ, we are received into
the family of God, and entitled to the inheritance
of heaven. This appears not so much a distinct
act of God, as involved in, and necessarily flow
ing from, our justification; so that at least the
one always implies the other. Nor is there any
good ground to suppose that in the New Testa
ment the term adoption is used with any refer
ence to the civil practice of adoption by the
Greeks, Romans, or other Heathens, and there
fore it is not judicious to illustrate the texts in
which the word occurs by their formalities.
The Apostles in using the term appear to have
had before them the simple view, that our sins
had deprived us of our sonship, the favour of
God, and the right to the inheritance of eternuj
life; but that, upon our return to God, and re
conciliation with him, our forfeited privileges
were not only restored, but greatly heightened
through the paternal kindness of God. They
could scarcely be forgetful of the affecting para
ble of the prodigal son; and it is under the same
view that St. Paul quotes from the Old Testa
ment, ‘‘Wherefore co.me out from among them,
and be ye separate, sahh the Lord, and touch not
the unclean thing, and I will receive you, and I
will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my
sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.”
Adoption, then, is that act by which we who
were alienated, and enemies, and disinherited,
are made the sons of God, uud heirs of his eter
nal glory. “ If children, then heirs, heirs of
God and joint heirs with Christ;" where it is to
be remarked, that it is not in our own right, nor
in the right of any work done in us, or which
we ourselves do, though it should be an evan
gelical work, that we become heirs ; but jointly
with Christ, and in his right.
3. To this state belong, freedom from a servile
spirit, for we are not servants but sons; the
special love and care of God our heavenly Fath
er; a filial confidence in him ; free access to him
at all times and in all circumstances; a title to
the heavenly inheritance; and the Spirit of adop
tion, or the witness of the Holy Spirit to our
adoption, which is the foundation of ail the com
fort w-e can derive from those privileges, as it is
the only means by which we can know that they
are ours.
4. The last mentioned great privilege of adop
tion merits special attention. It consists in the
in ward witness or testimony of the Holy Spirit
to the sonship of believers, from which flows a
comfortable persuasion or conviction of our pres
ent acceptance with God, and the hope of our
future aud eternal glory. This is taught in sev
eral passages of Scripture:—
Rom. viii. 15, 16, “For ye have not received
the spirit of bondage again to fear, but the Spirit
of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.
The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit
that we are the children of God." In this pas
sage it is to be remarked, 1. That the Holy
Spirit takes away “ fear," a servile dread of God
as offended. 2. That the “ Spirit of God” here
: mentioned, is not the personified spirit or genius
of the Gospel, as some would have it, but “the
Spirit itself," or biinseif, and hence he is call
ed in the Galatians, “the Spirit of his Son,”
which cannot mean the genius of the Gospel. 3.
That he. inspires a filial confidence in God, as
our Father, which is opposed to “the fear" pro
duced by the spirit of bondage. 4. That he ex
cites this filial confidence, and enables us to call
God our Father, by witnessing, bearing testi
! mony with our spirit, “that we are the children
of God."
!
Gal. iv, 4-b, " cut when the tulnessot the tune
was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a
woman, mado under the law, to redeem them
that were under the law, that we might receive
the adoption of sons; and because ye are sons,
God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into
your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.” Here also
are to be noted, 1. The means of our redemp
tion from under (the curse of) the law,—the in
carnation and sufferings of Christ. 2. That the
adoption of sons follows upon our actual redemp
tion from that curse, or, in other words, upon
our pardon. 3. That upon our being pardoned,
the “Spirit of the Son” is “ sent forth into our
hearts,” producing the same effect as that men
tioned in the Epistle to the Romans, viz: filial
confidence in God,—“crying, Abba, Father.”
To these texts are to be added all those passages,
so numerous in the New Testament, which ex
press the confidence and the joy of Christians;
their friendship With God; their confident access
to him as their God ; their entire union and de
lightful intercourse with him in spirit.
This ha; been generally termed the doctrine
of assurance, and, perhaps, the expressions of St.
Paul, “the full assurance of faith,” and “the full
assurance of hope, may warrant the use of the
word. But as tndre is a current nnd generally
understood sense ol this term, implying that the
assurance of our present acceptance and sonship
implies an assurance of our final perseverance,
I and of an indefeasible title to heaven; the phrase,
| a comfortable persuasion, or conviction of our
| justification ana adoption, arising out of the
I Spirit’s inward and direct testimony, is to be pre
! ferred.
There is, also, another reason for the sparing
and cautious use of the term assurance, which is,
that it seems to imply, though not necessarily,
the absence of all doubt, and shuts out all those
lower degrees of persuasion which may exist in
' the experience of Christians. For, our faith
may not at first, or at all times, be equally strong,
and the testimony of the Spirit may have its de
grees of clearness. Nevertheless, the fullness of
this attainment is to be pressed upon every one:
“ Let us draw near,” says St. Paul to all Christ
ians, “ with full assurance of faith.”
It may serve, also, to remove an objection
sometimes made to the doctrine, and to correct an
error which sometimes pervades the statement of
it, to observe that this assurance, persuasion, or
conviction, whichever term be adopted, is not of
the essence of justifying faith ; that is, justifying
faith does not consist in the assurance that I am
now forgiven, through Christ This would be
obviously contradictory. For we must believe
before we can be justified; much more before
we can be assured, in any degree, that we are
justified:—this persuasion, therefore, follows just
ification, and is one of its results. But though
we must not only distinguish, but separate, this
persuasion of our acceptance from the faith which
justifies, we must not separate it, but only distin
guish it, from justification itself. With that
coine in as concomitants, adoption, the “ Spirit of
adoption,” und regeneration.— Watson's Dic
tionary.

THE WOUNDED SPIRIT.
The London papers furnish a melancholy ac
countofthe deccaseof Mr. La man Blanchard. He
was a gentleman of exquisite literary taste, and
admired as a writer. He was a chief contributor
to Punch, a periodical in London, which is a de
pository of wit ; and his articles \*ere among the
raciest and most amusing which entertained the
readers of that humorous sheet. How singular,
however, are the contrasts which are often ob
servable in the same individual character!
While Mr. Blanchard .could dispel the gloom
from the brow of others, he could not chase it
from his own ; and while bis writings might
lead others to suppose that his gaiety and humour
were inexhaustible, he became dispirited by a
domestic calamity ; the stern realities of sorrow
overtook him ; he was scared with night visions
and would not be left alone ; and in a moment of
awful temptation, in the prime of life, and to the
horror of those who had often laughed at his jests,
; he cut himself ofi from life by a suicidal hand,
i “A wounded spirit, who can bear V The catas
| trophe furnishes another sad exemplification of
the fact, that a merry exterior may o'ften be the
covering of a heart corroded with grief A cele
brated physician once recommended a stranger
who called on him for medical relief, under a
distressing mental depression, to go and hear a
comic player who was at that time nUracting
nightly large crowds to the theatre, that he might

i These are but examples of what is common in
'the so called gay world. A beautiful mask
1 over the face of a hideous skeleton is often the
| type, ol those mental tortures which are conceal
ed under a gay exterior. The world that is at
| enmity with God, amidst all its festivities, is not
I a happy world. Its votaries, eager as they are
| in their pursuit, soon find out that they are cha
sing a phantom, which mocks while it eludes
them. Men of the world need not be told that
1 their pleasures are vapid and unsatisfying ; they
know it well, while they have not the inclination
to seek solid satisfaction where alone it can be
found, in the favour of God. The confession of
that proud nobleman, Lord Chesterfield, is well
known ; but we may quote it and read it again
and again, for the striking moral which it con
luins. * i nave run. sum m, -nits sniy rounas
of business and pleasure, and have done with
them all. 1 have enjoyed all the pleasures of
the world, and consequently, know their futility,
and I do not regret tbeir loss. I appraise them
at their real value, which is, in truth, very low ;
whereas those who have not experienced, always
overrate them. They only see their gay out
side, and arc dazzled with their glare; but 1 have
been behind the scenes. 1 have seen all the
coarse pulleys and dirty ropes which exhibit and
move the gaudy machines ; and I have seen and
smelt the tallow candles which illuminate the
whole decoration to the astonishment and admi
ration of an ignorant audience. When I reflect
back upon what I have seen, what I have heard,
and what I have done; I can hardly persuade
myself that all that frivolous hurry and bustle,
and pleasure of the world, had any reality; but
I look on all that has passed as one of those ro
mantic dreams which opium commonly occas
ions ; and i by no means desire to repeat the
nauseous dose for the sake of the fugitive
dream. Shall I tell you that I bear this
melancholy situation with, that meritorious con
stancy and resignation, which most people boast
of? No ; for I really cannot help it I bear
it because I must bear it, whether I will or riot.
I think of notbingbut killing time the best way I
can, now that he has become my enemy. It is
my resolution to sleep in the carriage the remain

Such was his life, such its reward, and such his
resolutions I Who would not prefer the lot of
the humblest Christian, who can smile through
his tears, and while he makes the same estimate
ofthe world, looks forward with a brightening

MISSION TO THE CALMUC IN RUSSIA.
More than seventy years ago, a Mission
was begun by the Moravian Brethren among 'v
the Calmuc Tartars, which, after a short trial,
was necessarily abandoned, but the object itself
was never given up. ‘ Failing in the direct-at
tempt to plant the Gospel among these fierce ‘
and restless barbarians, in the year 1765 a colony
was established on the banks of the Wolga, to
which various families and individuals from
German congregations emigrated, and the place
which they called Sarepta, is now one of the *
most considerable of the Brethren’s settlements, o - <
The station was expressly occupied for the pur
pose of cultivating a friendly intercourse with ,
the numerous hordes that frequent the neigh- . •
borhood,till the set time should come, when
| they would hearken to the Gospel.
| Though no opportunity of preaching Christ
to these Gentiles was neglected, all instruction
| seemed to be in vain, till within a few years
past, when the way was opened for the renewal'
I of a regular mission among them. -Since then,
'several Brethren, wandering or sojourning with *
them as they mved or rested, in the adjacent re
gion, have been diligently endeavoring to teach ;
them the truth as it is in Jesus; and by the hies- i
sing of the Lord, now one, and then another, *
among the Calmucs, have had their hearts open
ed, and their minds enlightened by the Holy
Spirit. So gently, yet so safely, bath the good.'
Shepherd led these lost sheep, after he bad *
found them in the wilderness, that their livea ‘‘
being endangered, from the wolves among their ""
countrymen, on account of their Christian pro- ’
! Cession, they were moved to take a step, perhaps
unexpected among their tribes, who are rovers
| from their birth, to leave the horde, and settis
1 upon a little island in the Wolga, near Sarepta,
S where, under the eye of their teachers, and the j ,
I protection of the Emperor Alexander, they bop
j ed to live quiet and peaceable lives, in all godli
| ness and honesty. This migration has been .. ;
; effected, and the desolate island is now inhabited j
| by a class of people hitherto unknown in the
history of man—Tartars become Christians, and
| settled upon one spot for the purpose of agricul
ture and commerce!
It -was on a stormy evening, that these first
| lings of the Calmuc race arrived on the land be
i longing to the colony of Sarepta. Their teach
er, Brother Schill, on horseback, led their
march ; he was accompanied by several of the
heads of families, and followed by the main body .
of the men on foot. Behind these came their
camels, three in number, loaded, after the man
ner of the East, with tent-skins, on which the
women were seated. The next objects in tha
procession, were two Calmuc carts, drawn by
horses, and another dr&wn by a bullock, like
I wise loaded with tent-skins and furniture, on
which the young children were placed, while
I the elder walked by their side. Some of the ■ .
j stoutest boys brought up the rear, driving before ■'*
■ them seventy head of cattle, sheep and goats.
Their march lay along the banks of the river, v
and a boat, containing a small party, accompan
ied it on the stream. Tbe evening grew calm,
and the sun was set, before they had all reached *
! the end of their pilgrimage. It was a spectacle
never witnessed on earth before, and surely there
was joy in heaven among the angels of God
ov%r these sinners that thus repented. 1 - *
Day after day, before they had taken full
possession of their island, the Brethren and Sis
ters, young and old, from Sarepta, visited the
encampment of the fugitives* and bade them >
welcome in the name of the Lord. They had
pitched their tents about three miles from tha
village, and there they abode, hearing the word of
I God preached, praying and praising him, both in
j the great assembly, and in their family circles.
! Among their visitors, was the venerable Brother
Steinman, eighty-three years of age, and one of
the first settlers of Sarepta. He, as well as tha
few Surviving fathers of the colony, had never
forgotten the original purpose of the place—to
be a frontier post on the verge 6( the kingdom of
darkness, from which to send the glad tidingsof
salvation into the heart of Asia. For this con
summation, he and they had been offering up
j daily prayers for. more than half a century.
I When, therefore, he heard of the arrival of this
company of Calmuc confessors, the patriarch
[ seized his staff, which he had long laid aside,
[ and notwithstanding the distance and his infirmi
ties, by the help of friends who supported - his
steps, he reached the camp. There, alter behold
ing with his own eyes what God had wrought
for these poor savages, and having heard them
sing in their native tongue various hymns that
spake of the sufferings pf Christ, and the glory
that should follow, he broke out into a transport
of joy, and returned home thanking and bietsiag
God. Two days afterwards he closed his eye#,
and departed in peace, having seen the salvation
of the Lord thus come to the outcasts of Tartary.
