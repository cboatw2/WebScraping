MR. WEBSTER'S FARM. [
Wii extract the following account of Mr.
Webster's farm in Masaaciiusctts, from
a letter of a young correspondent of |
the New York Commercial Advertiser, j
v ho at the time of writing the letter |
wax on a visit to a son of Webster on j
the farm. The letter is elated Oct.?

" After breakfast, the weather being j
indescribably fine, wo set forth together
for a stroll over the farm. The residence j

in Kii"land and'on thecontinerit, in places j
. j
whom agriculture and Horticulture nave <
attained 1 heir greatest perfection, has enlarged
ins views, enriched Ills mind, and ^
most eminently qualified hiin lor tlie highest
enjoyments as well as most valuable j
improvements, while, seeking relaxation
Irom his studies, lie spends a month or two
*>n the plantation, lie considers the cultivation
of a farm as it should he cuitivn. j
ted, one of the noblest pursuits to which
an intelligent man can devote himself.?
(
Need any farmer he ashamed of his occu- )
notion gf regret that he is not encased in !
P~ CO
some of the learned professions, or m commerce,
or in some trade, when lie finds
such men as Daniel Webster and his worthy
son laboring in the fields us a matter
of choice ? If ho he ashamed and does I
thus regret, nil I have to say to him is that
he is grossly ignorant of tire (nils and perplexities
of those pu:suits, and does not
appreciate that in which he is engaged.
Had I half the knowledge which my i
young friend possesses on the subjects of j
agriculture and horticulture, I could give !
you a description of what 1 have seen to ;
day that would not perhaps be devoid of j
interest.
The larrn embraces about thirteen bun
drcd acres and is situated, as I told you i
in my letter night before l ist, on tlie shore i
of the ocean, where the waves at high
I?do dash ug.wn.st the walls ami throw i
tUeir K|>r;ty into his very garden, it is
composed of u part of tho old estate o! I
Governor Winslow and a part of tho rs- 1
tale of .Mr, Thomas, who waj a wealthy
refugee of olden turn*, 'i'ne Winslow
mansion, which was built one hundred ami
fortv seven Years ago, is stiii standing on
^ r ' ~
the premises in a pretty good state of pre- j
sVrvation, bearing however (lie visible
marks of time. Edward Winslow was
tbe most distinguished rncmhcr of a family
of eight children, five brothers and |
three sisters.
In 10*37 ho obtained a grant of this
tract of land, then called Green's Harbor, !
now JMarshfield, to which he gave the }
mwne of Caresrull. The estate continued
in the family till about ten }cars since, ,
vlhcn it came into possession of Mr. Webster.
Kdward \Vinflow's son, Josiah,
born at IMvmoulh in 16*2$, was Governor
of the colony from 1673 to his death in
-16S0. His last surviving male dcsccn.
O I
dam if; Mr. Isaac Winslow, of Hoston, who
iuui.v..vn^. /.r liur ll
UI i^iiiui p<ii II uita III nil - - __
- iustrious ancestors." The other part of j
the farm remained in the Thomas family '
until about ten years ago, when .Mr. Web. |
ster acquired what lie now owns. On this |
part stands the old mansion house, huilt
seventy-!wo years since, and from which j
ti?e British soldiers ma chcd to the battle | j
ot Bunker Hill. It is not improbable that j (
in this very room the Colonel slept the ;
night before he sallied forth. There are j j
other houses of less note, but of ancient ,
date on the premises, besides numerous j
barns, sheds, and all the requisite outhouses
for such a plantation.
Although the farm when found by the '
Pilgrims was as they said, a "spit'sdepth, j
excellent black mould, and not fat in some
places; two or three great oaks, but not
very thick, pines, walnuts, beech, ash, J
birch, hazel, holly, sassafras in abundance,
and vines every where, cherry trees, plum
iryj-s, and many others which we know
not. Many kinds of herbs wc found here
in winter, as strawberry leaves innumerable,
sorrel, yarrow, carvel, brooklirne, li\erwort,
water cresses, great store of leeks ,
and onions, and an excellent kind of flax
and hemp. Here is sand, gravel, and ex11

vol time had materially changed its charucler,
and ceaseless cultivation had almost <
worn it out. Hut (luring the ten years it ;
has been under the hand ol Mr. Webster, I
11 seems 10 he restored to its primitive I
productiveness,
A small part of the farm is what is called
here a "salt meadow/' from which he
gathers annually a large quantity of hay
,or his young cattle. There are about 1
hreo hundred acres of woodland, nearly i
iwo hundred of which have been planted
by .Mr, Web.-ter hiivsclf. and are now in
tfie most Hourishing condition. Nothing !
i nn exceed the beauty and variety of the ,
foliage of this young wilderness, as i saw
ii to day. 'There is near the house a little
.
hillock, which, when he came here, lie
found a hai l en sand hill, blown about by
inc winds, bui which is now covered and
waving with thrillv tree*, embracing ali,

Onthe apex of the hil! he has erected a ,
puituncr-housc. which, with the surround- '
I
ing grove, frrnis one of the prettiest pic- !
tores 1 can imagine, lie continues to I
plant trees, and, like Stephen Guard, , ,
would plant n tree to-d.iy though ho were
to the to-inorrow." IJefore the door of | (
toe mansion stands an aged elm, which
excites my admiration and receives his | ,
greatest care. Its branches reach to tho j ,
giound, somewhat like those oi a weeping ! ,

the hang.ug houghs, measured Iroin the
t-j?s on one side to the other, is eighty.

?! v-rz: . .'ji-.-e;--. .r-v .t -.-- jt.t;

^paco for the most agreeable ramble.?
Throughout all tuese groves there are a v.
o r
enues where ladies may take an airing
on horse-hack <?r a drive in a carriage at
their pleasure, without obtrusion. The ;
day is not far distant when if you come J
here you will see the nimble deer bound- 1
nig ft mil side to side as in their native
His orchard is extensive, and t!?cre is
no end to variety of* his apples, of which
I spoke in a previous letter. To-day at
dinner wo drank .Marshfield cider, which, j
having been bottled some time, is equal in I
goodnc.ssto moie than hull'the champagne
imported from abroad.
Adjacent to the house is a beautiful
poiui of fresh water which fills up the
hack ground of trie scenery, and p.oduces
an enchanting effect as one turns round 1
to take a view of the whole. Not far off,
in his poultry-yard, is another pond, in ,
which the ducks and geese, wild and tame, ,
are sporting at all hours of tiie day. In
the raising of poultry, a business to which j
few farmers give much attention, tiie <
greatest pains have been taken, and the !
greatest skill has been displayed.
It costs no more, I find, to raise chick-i
oris, any one of w hich is as large as a j
common turkey, than it does to raise those j
of the meaner kind.
It is quite curious to look into this yard I
and see Lite various sorts of fowls brought J
hither from all quarters of the globe. Not- '
withstanding the vast concerns which we j
ail know have crowded upon tiie owner's j
mind for the last ten years, none of those
little tiungs have escaped ins attention.
I have seen in the different fields some ,
.-evenly head of cattle, the finest which I j
have seen for many a day. While in f
Kngland, having a good opportunity, ho j
selected from the best herds known in any j
of the counties some of the most famous
breeds and imported them, from which he
.s now producing and has already prod accd
the most valuable cattle in the United i
States, i knew that a celebrated farmer j
at Ashland had long devoted himself to j
this branch ol business, and had justly he-,
come famous for his productions ; but I
had no conception that I should find a ri- j
val to him in this respect so foimidable as j
I have in the farmer of Marshfield. He J
has a yoke of led or bay oxen raised on <
this farm, which in all points most adinir-/'
ed by good judges cannot be excelled, and <
especially ;n point of beauty. I saw an I]
other pair of black oxen grazing in (be j 1
field, which in point of size, with the j1
single exception of the great ox owned '
by ;Wr. Rust, surpass any tiling of the ox I
kind I have ever seen. His full blooded 1
bulls and cows and young cattle are all
fine specimens and in good keeping with 1
every thing else here. His sheep too ex- i 1
cited my highest admiration. They are of
the Leicester breed, selected and import. I
cd by himself, and are probably the finest '
blood and size of any in this country.? s
One of them, j???iiit<.<! <?ut to mc, is not on- 1
ly the largest 1 ever saw, but in several 1
other respects excels all the ideas i ever | j
bad of sheep. |}
The shepherd calls this one Golinh, and ! (
has taken from it one fieece which weigh. ! ,
jd sixteen pounds. This may have been | i
beaten ; hut, if so, the fact is not known ),
lo an individual so humble as myself. The j
greatest care is properly bestowed upon
these flocks and herds, for they are truly j i
objects worthy the ambition of any man ' ^
however exalted. I
In going from ono pasture to another, I (
passed through his fields of corn, of which j
lie has raised this year not less than nine
t *
hundred or a thousand bushels. I lie seed ;
selected must have been of the most vn- .
limbic kind. I begged four ears of it, j
which I intend to carry with me, one for ; t
Charles Stetson, one for your friend Mr.'/
Francis Hall, one for my friend Luther (
Loomis of SuftieM, and the other I shall ! t
retain myself till I can get a piece of land ,
on which to plant it, and then I will cail
it the Webster corn. j,
I passed through a field of turnips jn j f
which I estimated the quantity at two'c
thousand bushels. A crop ?f this kind i
in England, I am loin, is regarded as of j
the utmost value, not only for the uses to '
which it is put, but because it does not j<
impoverish the soil so much where it I
grows. Of hay I saw from three to five i
hundred tons, and oats, and potatoes, and ' i
other crops in equal proportions.
Af or going the rounds of ilie farm,
which I have done to-day with great satis- , I
faction, it appeared to nie that 1 hud been
attending an agricultural fair, so various ! i

seen. I mention these matters in detail, i
because you, like invself, may have been J <
unacquainted with the allurements which ,
have drawn .Mr. Webster here, and of the ! I
extent of the operations which invite his <
attention as a farmer. ' ]
I have not however, intended to men- <

may not know or see at any time by pass- J s

UKIVIXO NAILS.
"One of the fir6t lessons \vc ever learned at ; (
carpentering (for we have before said we arc a I
jack of all trades) was how to drive a nail. Sim- S <
pie as it is, there is an important point in nail | (
driving which one would be surprised to sec so j ,
many not understand. How often is a farmer,
r-T, rr>i irettI rnr>nrlinrr nr rnbtilincr ua some of llis I ,
444 O I - .
implements, provoked at wh it he thinks the unac- j j
rountablc tendency of his wood to split when he j .
drives his mils into it! We have seen thetn in ,
suah eases take a gimlet and carefully bore a way j
at grout labor till proper holes for the nails they i
thought were formed, the.i take their nails, and lor
want of knowing the simple thing of how to place '
it in the wood, split their boarJ at lu6t, and have r
to give it up, or do their job over again. Look at 1
i nail. Two of its opposite sides are parallel, and
two Jorm .in airjle with each other, giving it some. v
thing of tht bape. and all the j?o*.ver of a we.lge. J '
Put in these wedge sides not crosswise with the
grain of the wood, for in that ease no better means
could be devised to split it, but so that the par.
tides of wood displaced arc forced aside lengthwise
with the grain, and the two parallel sides going
down between the ridges of the grain give no
lateral pressure?and none but those hard species
of wood whose particles are as hard to be displaced
one way as another, will be split.
Workmen who drive nails in ticklish places, or
into wood so hard as to be difficult to penetrate,
should ircl the nail between their hps before driving,
which much facilitates its entrance and diminishes
the danger of splitting?and besides makes it hold
extremely strong from the coat of rust which will
cover its surface.''?<S\ IV. Farmer.
The nail will drive better if the point is stuck

THE ARTESIAN WELL AT PARI*"-.
TJic operation of tubing the well at Grcnclle has
recently been completed in the most satisfactory
manner. In order to understand the importance
of this work it may be well to refer to the causes
which have rendered it necessary.?In the month
of February, 1841, after eight years' persevering
labor, the spring at Grcnellc began to pour forth a
volume of water of not less than 2,600 litres a
minute. But although the source was as pure as
that of the Seine, it has as dark a color as the
water in the gutters of the streets. A pipe of
joints, 1,890 feet in length, copper turned, made
as a telescope, was placed in the excavation ; but
not being strong enough to resist the force of the
ascending waters, it was soon flattened and destroyed.
M. Mulot, thereupon, had anew tube of
beated iron made, each joint of which was thick
enough to resist a pressure equal to 70 atmospheres.
?On the 20th of this month, after only four days' labor
the tube was properly fixed, and the water now
flows abundantly, clear as rock crystal, and at a
milk-warm heat. The old workshop from the
middle of which the current flowed, is already lrdf
destroyed, and on its site the carpenters arc erecting
a scaffolding of strong pine boards, 109 feet
high, which will direct and form a channel for the
waters rising to this height.?Paris will now pos
sess an incxhaustablc supply of excellent water,
rushing from such an elevation n6 to be easily distributed
to the loftiest situations in the city.
[ From another source we learn that the temperature
of the water is about 82 degrees of Fahrenheit.]
AN" AWKWARD DII.KMMA.
A London paper states that a young man and
woman, inhabitants of Brighton, accompanied by
a marriage procession of their friends and relatives,
recently appeared atthcaltar of one of the churches
o: trie metropolis for the purpose of tying the hymeneal
knot. The ceremony had proceeded to
the place where the clergyman had to pronounce
the declaratory words that the man and woman
iad become husband and wife, when the minister
lad a notification made to him which induced him
:o ask who was the bridegroom's former wife ? I
Flic reply was the present bride's sister; when
die clergyman announced that such marriage was
illegal, and refused to proceed with the ceremonial.
All the parties were aware of the relationship, but
arobably were not aware of the recent alteration
n the law, making marriage with a deceased wife's
iistcr illegal.
A GREAT DISCOVERY.
We have been favored by Mr. Warner with an
ntervicw on the subject of his grand discovery,
vlicn the following dialogue took place between
mrselves and the modest enthusiast, who only
vants half a millionof money as a " bird in hand"
icforc he lets the minister know what he has got
4 in the bush"?thct is to say, in the bruins under
lis hair.
Punch received Mr. Warner in the office in
Wellington street. The time chosen was day.
ireuk, in order that the 44 great secret" might not
>c over-heard ; and our boy ingeniously placed his
:.ip over the opening of our letter box, lest a syL
able should escape through the aperture.
Punch began by asking what the nature of the ;
pvention really was, when Mr. Warner explained
I
is fellows :
" I take," said the inventor, 14 an explosive sub
t.uice, and forming it into a solvent, I make a J
ulcruin, by an irregular process. I then apply
he whole to an opposing entity, and if that en.
ity is a fleet or a fortress, 1 either blow it up, or do
lot."
Punch?*' Ah?ah ! I sec what you mean ; vou
lip the end of a diaculous preparation into
i washy diluent, and having applied the phosphate
>t* potatoes to the ammonia of pickled cabbage,
,ou accomplish what you wish. Tiut is it, if I
ipprehcnd you rightly."
.Mr. Warner confessed that that was the nearest
explanation lie could give of his discovery.
Punch?44 And now?as to its powers. Vou j
jndertukc to blow up a licet at six miles disancc
?"
Mr. Warner?44 1 do."
Punch?44 Do you mean to say that 3*011 could }
blow up the Bachelor steamboat in its moorings at ;
Uattcrsca, if you were standing at the six mile 1
?tonc on the (heat North Road ?"
Mr. Warner would also pledge himself to that,
if ?400,000 were first paid into has hand and sc:urcd
to him.
Punch?" I see 3"our meaning exactly. You
liavc only 10 convey a stream of clcclo-gulvanisin
down a given avenue of unlimited length, and by
placing the aim within your reach you gain your !
abject. For instance, you could empty the treas. I
Liry at one blow, spiking the public pocket, and j
scuttling the pay oflicc, if every facility were giv- j
Am I r'nrlit in tin- vipiv I t:iko nf vmir !
1 "o - J I
meaning ?"
Mr. Warner?" Quite so. The fulcrum I wish I
to get into my hands is ?100,000; and then I ;
must be allowed to go a long way oft', when I j
will give a specimen of what I meant by my dis-,
covcry."
Punch?" You arc a credit sir, to your country, j
Piie trick, which I fully comprehend, is a capital;
jnc; and it is very hard that they will not give j
rou an opportunity' of playing it."
The intercourse ended by Punch promising to i
nakc the merits of the thing known in their true j
brce ; and advised that Sir F. Burdctt should be I
ipplicd to as the most fit person to advocate the
claims of the inventor in Parliament.

Salt ror. Hons.?Hogs, during the process of:
attcning, should be supplied with salt as often as j
>nce a week. It is no less advantageous to them
than to the ox, the cow, or the sheep; and, when
iberally exhibited, is a preventive of many diseases!
vhich, from their continual confinement, and t't<- J
ffo.-'s of h< ir?v fo iVy ;rc inevitably r.\yr?s< J. j
Store hogs, als?, arc greatly benefitted by it, an 1
will partake of it once or twice a week as eagerly
and, to all appearance, with as good zest as they
do of corn or meal. Charcoal is also highly salutary
in its influences upon a hog.
Too much salt at a time is injurious, and even
dangerous to swine. A pint of strong brine would
kill a hog.
A STORY THAT MADE I'S I.At'GIl.
Coming down the river on that pleasant and
| well officered l>oat, the Pathfinder, we were told
I an excellent sforr- :it le.ist it ?? nc Tr.r.1
I Green, wiicn commanding another boat, had on
, board a dry, humorous pilot, named Pennington,
j A deck passenger, having drowned his cares, if he
' had any to drown, in 44 bald face" whiskey, quirtly
laid down to sleep, and as quietly died. An
hour or so after, it was discovered that lie was
dead, the boat landed at a wood yard, and the defunct
toper was deposited in an extempore coffin,
j and shovelled away. Pennington looked and shook
i . . .
! his head, perhaps in discontent with ail liquor, bcj
cause it had killed off one lover of it in this abrupt
' manner?perhaps dissatisfied with his hasty intermcnt.
The next day a passenger came on board, who
had evidently been looking at some one drinking,
and whose repeated visitations to the forbad rather
incapacitated hiin for forensic exercises. He talked
thickly, and stammeringly. Having madchi^way
to the hurricane deck, Pennington, who was at
the wheel, for some time narrowly observed him,
and at length thus accosted him :
" Ilallo, stranger, you'r drunk!"
" 0!i no, only slightly interrogated," was some!
where about the reply.
41 Well," said Pennington, 44 let me give you a
j bit of advice. Don't go to sleep on tins boat, for
( if they don't bury you may I be shot. Why, there
! was a chap yesterday got drunk and went to sleep,
! and in two hours they buried him. The man was
no more dead than I am. They serve all drunken
men so on this boat. Why, I drink myself, and
darscn't go to sleep on the boat. I haven't slept
{ for two weeks, for if I close my eyes I know they 11
burv me."
Pennington's story so alarmed the passenger,
tliat it perfectly sobered him, and he did not drink
another dram on the boat.?Satchez Courier.
