Although more than one-unrd of the
session is past, niothig has been done in
r elatiuu to The chief objects of the session.
The w arehousio& bili has not yet been. ta
ken up. and the iaankrupt Act is not yet
repealed. %e have some little doubt
abetber the bankrupt Act may not be re
tained under more modifietions. Every
day's delay operates against the uncondi
tional repeal.
Mr. Calbeen, ihis morning, in present.
;ag a memorial 1e he repeal of the Bank
rupt Act, tok occasion to say that be was
in favor of the epeal. as be held the law
to be inexpedient mad uncousitutional. Mr.
Tallmadge therespna presented two re
moctranes against the repeal. and said
that be hoped the committee on the judi
ciary would so modify the law as to ran
der it both constitutional and ex dinet.
"An efbr:2 is to be made to retain th prom
pbetive fetures of the Act, aud the cam
to-day. settled ohe Oregon
bouuary.question, by passing ibe bill for
the atcupaion and-ettlememt of that terri
tary. -There is no doubt, that under the
iIueement of this law, there will be a
vast eUig son to the Oregon. At the
close of the prem century, when our
population mill be ninety-two millions, a
large portion of it wil be in that Oregon
c6untry. and our trade with the East In.
4 edie, which is deitined to be immensely
increased. wvill be carried on from the Co
lumbia river, with which there will be an
inlaud communicatio., by steam to the
Mississippi. There is a great deal in this
little Oregon bill; and I judge tros the
remarks of odme of its ftiends. that there
is not a ile danger that it will give much
umbrage to John Bull. That there is to
be a dilenly in settling the Oregon bonn
dav by lreaty is certain. dome even
doubt whether we have a good title to the
torinery. But this bil setles the matter
by ceulring our tide. There is no doubt
that the Houe will also pass it.
The debase o' the pro ition b) repeal
the Bankrupt Act, sIll engrosses the
House to the exclusion of every thing else.

MR. PICKEN'S REMARKS,
Os the Bigae repea te Bamkrvpt Law
Mr Briggs had moved that the bill h:
niinari to the Casnmitee oan tie Judi
claryvwith the linlewig instructions:
** rpf s bil t - repeal that part .o
the existing law which authorizes the via
luntary application of debtors, andl to iu
elude corporations which issue paper s
circulate as money within the opieration
of said law."
Which proposed instructions Mr. C
Johnson had moved to amndi so as to itn
struct the committee to re-port a bill faa
the immediate repealof the batnkrupi law
withbout limuit or qualification; [simplly, it
race, striking out the proviso of ite origi
nal bill of Mr. E verett.]
Thae moaaiona to commit with instrnetsiota
takhes precedence of the motion to urmend
rte bill.
So the Brat question which vow recur
red was on the proposed amendment o1
Mr. C. Johnson to the instrtuctiotns or .\r.
Briggs.
M r. Pickens took the floor, aud, arter a
promise to he very brie' in his remaarks
and an allusion, imperfectly heard tay 'he
Reporter, to the commencement tat the
present discussion, went on to say th.at s
he should permit himself, in his actiona or
that floor, to consult merely the feelinga
of his heart, and listen alone to the prompt
ions of the kindier sympathies of hisi na
ture, he certainly should not be so hard
hearted as to deny the benefits ini the bank
rapt law to the unfortunate. His friend,
the gentleman from Louisiana,.(Mr. Dawi
son,) whbo alone, of the whole Democratic
party, had originally voted in favor of tbe
law. and who now opposed its repeal, had
said every thing that could be said by any
one os that side of the question;t and Mr.
P. confessed tht, while listenaing to his
hum waranappeals in favor of the poor debt
or, alt tho symapaihetic emotions of his
breast had been strongly roused. But he
could not, he repeated, be guided in thec
task of legislation by his feelings and sym
pathies. He would not, indeed, unader
take to maintain that no bankrupt law
could ever he construeted whbich should
conform to the requisitions of the Consti
tution and meet the spirit of that instrn
~ment upon the subjeet. And this brought
him to tbe closing remark of the gentlemen
from Georgia whbo had just taken his seat,
(Mr. Merrwether.) That gentdeman had
asked how this law could he held useon
stitutional while the Constitution express
ly declared that Congress should possesis
thec power to pass '"uanor laws on the
subject of tanakrupteies throughout rte U.
States?" It was very true that the Con
stitution did so declare: bat what kind of
laws? Mr- P. considered this very power
as one of the most dangemous and most us
eertaimr perwwbicb the Constitution con
rained This provision, and rbst whichem
piowered Congress to regulate commerce,
were t wo of the most extensive grants of
poner in the whole instrumsent; and this,
in relation to a bankrupt law, was a pw
er the least understood of anry. Under
this convictio., he would be very strict in
his construction of those clauses. A t the
time the Constitution was drafled-the term
hankruptey had reference to the statutes
of England andtoithe decisions ofthe Er.
ish courts, and the consructions- we nasd
ved nmBritish law wtiiersupoitthemf.
The statute asdia- the reign of He'nry
VIII. was th frst ever enacted itt En-t
gland on that subject: and gentlemen
rfomiliur with leaal studies well knew hww
very limited nod bow jealonsly. gAedI
that statute was It applied I-tradis'
only who were' areemed to-be swindk
and had been enacted fur .the beneIibf
creditora only. whom it enabled to saitait
a comtission of bankruptcy in the canes
-specified, and to conpel an assignmaent'
and division of the debtor's assets among
them. This ancient statute bad beei-the
foundation of all the legislation which had
since taken place on the general subject o'
bankruptcy in Great Britain. an 'aery
strong doubts were entertained, aWr all
that had been done, whether more bAefit
or injury had resulted; a'nd this even un
der a consolidated Government like theiri,
within the limits of a small island, acd
with a Parliament that was held to be ow
nipotent.
It had been 'asserted in nrgumenu that
there % a- 'n truth n. real diferener be
tween an irsolveht and a bankrupt'law.
This had recently been niintained.by a
jurist of very distinguished repeiasion,
and one vwhon lie confessed to be f15faore
learned than Mr. P.; but notwithstandimg
this, be must conceive thai there was a
broad and obvious distinction between the
two; insolvent laws being passed, *kefy
if not solely. for the benefit crdbtors
while statutes of bankruptcy wer inend
ed. on the contrary. for the rel' dii
tors. So far, therefore, as an rpt
law included the principle oF engitary
bankruptcy, so far it partook of 0 oature
of an insolvent law, and to that isen he
held it to be wholly un'onstitutiono. Mr.
P. said be was for limiting tbe power giy
en in the Constitution to the strictas pos
sible limits. The idea of a bankrgt law.
even so late as the times of Blachkune.
had been that of a law intendedto afect
traders only, and enacted for the bpeslt of
creditors; but the law it was now propos
ed to repeal was a law for the benefit of
debtors almost exclusively; it wasin truth
an insolvent law, and was opposed to the
spirit if not the very letter of the Qpnstitu
tion. do undeniably -true was this, that
one of the friends of the law ianoether
pant of the Capitol had been driven to
take the ground that Congress di*possess
tle right to pass a law interfering iitb the
obligation of contracts, and to pass ex post
1fuclo law. The argument in sup port of
this monstrous position was, that the pow
er to pass such laws was by the Constien
oion prohibited only to the St-tes. and
that therefore it remained in posAbssion of
the General Government. To'Mr. P.
this appeared to be perfect solecism. lie
had ever held the doctrine that the-Federal
Government held its powers by specific
grant. and by nothing else. But here it
was contended that it derived its powers
irss those same powers havinugJeen de
hied to the States Such a doctrine went
ta %weep into the jurisdiction of this Fede
rot Governient every contract maeade
throughout the United States, and allowed
it the athibority of interfering witior abro
gating inie. Had gentlemen seriously
coitte.plaied the illimitable. the startling
conbequenres of such a doctrine! No such
lslow had ever before been atd at the
whole sYsIe of credit th o t the

Mr. P. tias espiecially opposed at the inne
the law was enacted, and it formed "tie of
the leading reasos why he nseut ir its
repeal.
It as said by gentlemen that lte law
hiad done all the mischief that it coaldt d.'
and now Congress were bound to co.i. it'-.
it, that they might help all who yet w e'
desirons of obtuaining its benefits. Mr. P.
said he 'lovedl the attributes of mercy. as
exercised by Government in stooping to
relieve the wretched and the downf~llen;
but he loved ntot less another attribute
which no less belotnged to it-that of hav
ing a bandage across its eyes, in token of
admsinistering its blessings to all alike,
withoni dit inetuion of the tow or the high.
of the prosperous or the poor; ansd he was.
therefote. utterly opposed to thiese appeals
so often made to their mere sypipathties as
mcen, instead of to their duty am legislators.
Mr. P. had witnessed wvith astmaihment
the propositions of his frienad frdm N. York.
in his eye. (Mr. AlcKeoni.) to incloide cor
porations in the scope0 of the hankrupt Ilaw.
This, instead of limiting and restricting
the sense of the term bankruptcy in the
Constitution within the narrowest ponsible
limits, was to extend it not only beyond
traders. to whom alone it originally refer
red, bat eveni to include within its. scopo
all corporal ions ?
If gentlenmen went on at this rate, what
power at all would they at last leave to
to the State ? If the amenment should
prevail, the law would be ,o altered as to
cover all corporations of every kind with~n
thie Stales. Church corporatonas, rail road
coinpanlies, colleges, school corporations,
all-all were to be swept within the bound
less range oeta Federal law. 51r. P., as
was well known to all who heard him, had
ever been as muchi opposedl to bsanks. atnd
all conntected with them, as any other man
in the country could lie. Long ago. andu
at a period when it required some hardi
hood to oppose the overwhelming tide of
moneyed itnlnence, in and out of the
House. be had. on that floor, opposed the
whole bank power and( inioence, whs-n
some, who were now the loudest in their
denuntciations,. had qusailed before it Hel
wouldl be the very Jast mats to advocate
the cattse of bsaniking corporations, there or
esewhere: but ho trusted, also. he ahouldi
so the Last to trample on the Cunstitusion
if his country. ace admit corporations i
,if any kind, and be know of no litnita
uions. Some of the banking corporations I
were ident itied with [he State Treasuries:
ilhis %-as the case in Alabama, and to
some extent within his own native State.
Declare the btate banks of Alabama in a
state of bankruptcy, and you might !weep
the whole State within the law-i law
which had been paws.d by fraud and all
sorts of iniquity.
What would be the fiscal effect of such
an arrhaagement! 1 would be to put all
the banksof the South and South-west
into the hands of the bunks of New York
and of New England. Declare the fitst
insolvent, and compel them to go into
bankruptcy, Rttd you would place them at
the feet and at the mercy of their Northern
neighbors. The result would he. in ef
feet, to establish a grand national bank in
New York, with branches in New Eng
land and in the Southern and, Southwes
tern States. lie was astonished that the
amendment should have been opposed by
gentlesen from New York and New Eng
and, except indeed on upright, constitu
tional grounds ; never, certainly, on any
calculation of their own advantage. He
considered the whoed measure as uncon
stitutional, and as odious in a high degree.
He had opposed the amendment because
he held it to be of the most dangerous
tendency; sweeping away, as it tnust,
with a ruthless hand, every power reser
ved to the States. It might be very right
in itself that some of the banks in the coun
try should be declared bankrupt; but do
this by a Federal statute of bankruptcy.
was of the worst example, and would go
to cover cases of every sort.
As. however, Mr. P. was sensible how
bard it was in gain the attention of the
House on topics of this description. he
should say no more about them, but would
pass ti some others which had been star
ted during the course of the present de
bate. The gelideman from 1lassachusalls,
M1r. Cushing, had certainl3 made a very
extraordinary speech. and one which had
Seen quoted and interpreted in a variety
of ways. He did not know that he ex
actly understood that gentleman's true
meaning in what he had said. If he had
meant, as some gentlemen thought he land,
that the power and patronage or this Ad.
ministration had been held out for the pur
pose of winning over those ora peculiar
description or politico, or that they were to
be wielded with a view to put downsone
and toratse others, it was a matter with
which Mt. P. had no particular concertt.
But if, in what he had said, the gentleman
referred to atny part or that portion of the
Democratic party with which it was 31r.
P's. pride and honor to act, he would say
to that gentleman that ie trainpled such of
fets with scorn aned contempt betteath lis
feet. He never had asked for ravors, nor
had ie ever decaded, itn tie slightest dle
gree, the whole power of the Government.
On the contrary, be had stood up blddlI
against it at i ttne when it required some
nerve to hold such an attitude. lfhe wa to
be reduced to a state of dependence or ier
vility by of'ersor persuasions of the imple
ments of Government here, it must be o.
some osberoecasion t*an the present. Not
that he had aty objcctioni to the exi-ting
President ; Mir. P. respected htis private
character for integrity, and thtou;;h he had
been traduced and abused in a mnost
shamcful tmanner; but it was not Mr. P's.I

As to the temrptatiots of office and pat
ronage to which allusion had been pretty
distinctly mtade, it was sufficient to say to
thte genit~nmau that those with whom Mir.
