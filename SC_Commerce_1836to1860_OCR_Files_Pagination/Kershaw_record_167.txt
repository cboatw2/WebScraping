THE success of the SOUTHERN TONIC is i
unprecedented. It has been anxiously sought <
after by all persons in every part of the United j
States, and its widely extended distribution lias (
been owing to the manv requests received from <
very section of the South and South West. Al- s
though it originated in an obscure part of the coun- t
try but a few years since, it is now found in all the t
principal towns and villnges in the Union, and its I
virtues as a cure for Ague and Fever, and ?? ? . i
general Tonic, are appreciated by all who have <
used it Being as it professes a compound of t
Southern Vegetables, it is needless to offer the as- <
suraoce that there is no Arsenic,Mercury, nor any i
thing in the least hurtful to the human constitution
in it. It will be found a valuable Medic.no
in all coses of Dyspepsia and disorganised Stomach i
and Bowclsl aha patients convalescing from 1 il- I
lious Fever, will derive the most important bene- t
fits from the use of the Southern Tonic. !t may i
lie administered to children and infants of the most 1

PATENT COTTON OIN. i
(i HIS Gin can be made double, or single, li (
*: made double, they reduce lubor, and gin just \
double, the quantity of cotton over the single cy lin- ,
der Gin, no other knd having been in use prevous
to this patent*, and whether single or double, they '
are found to improve the quality of the cotton, by 1
more perfectly cleaning it. They can be made to
contain from 20 to IGOsaws in a stand, and whether
small or large, one hand will be sufficient to attend
thein. The Gins have mechanical feeders and
hoppers attached to^them, which free the cotton
trom leaves, trash, dirt, &c. before it can reach the
b&ws, and by the thorough hackling operation it
receives from the feeders, which make two revo- ,
lutions to one of the saws, it is almost in a half
gined slate, before it descends to the saw By a
very simple arrangement of a screw to each set of
gaates, on which the hoppers rest, and through ,
which the teeth of tlie feeders pass, they can be
made to teed slow or fast to suit the condition of
the cotton at the time. When made double, the ,
raws are placed on two sets of cylinders nrwi
upon each otlicr in opposite directions, and are j
cleansed by two sets ot brushes that have four revolutions
to one of t\Ve saw. The two cylinders can
be detached so as to enable the planter to run one j
or both at pleasure, although embraced with feeders,
&c. in one stand. Tho whole is put in cmeration
with a drum and band, as in the ordinary Gin, and .
inay be propelled by horse, steam, or water power.
It may a'80 he propelled by iron running gear, j
The force required to work it, is about the same as
that necessary .to move an equal number of saws in j
the common Gin. This Gin has been put in
operation in New Orleans lor two or three weeks,
and its success tested in the presence of a large
number of planters, merchants and others, and
received their (general approbation .
Several gentlemen have been so kind as to give
the Patentee their written opinion respecting the
merits of the Gin. A number of others could be t
added, but the following ?? -i- J *

From bis Excellency Gov. While of Louisiana.
New Orleahs, Feb. 27,1837. J
Dr. A.Jones?Sir, In replv to your enquiry,
whatt think of your improved Cotton Gin, l.have .
to say, that I saw it work on Saturday (he 25th inst.
and was very much pleased With its performance.
The mere fact of Its self-feeding, seems to ine to
be a very valuable improvement; and besides, the
quality of the cotton, as it comes out of the process,
appeared to me to be better and cleaner than
from the common Gins in use, and lhal it saves
considerably in labor. Respectfully, Ac.

of irfy opinion of your Patent Cotton Gin, 1

and during fcMr years..of.that tine. 1 was
foreman in the house ol Messrs. Lewis, V illicms
Si Co., and near five years spinr.or in the house of
Messrs. fcrnndl'ord & Greene. 1 have ft en your
Cotton Gin in operation, ai d bnvc.cxcmirtd tl.e
:otton ginned by it, and pronounce ill otter rlrnr.led,
and the staple less injured, than cny ccttcn
hat ever came under my ohtcrvntion. It is rcmiletely
reai:y for the breaker without the aid of the
dower, and would, therefore, save the fust prcccss
n manufacturing the article, i consider colttn
ileansed by your Gin, would command frc m ere
Lo two cents on the pound m.t.rc than the overage
mops brought into the Manchester n.oikrt, ciid
:leanscd by common Gins. Yours, very irsp'ly.
