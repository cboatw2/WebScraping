n?? i From
the Camden Journal.
Stony Hill, Sept. 26, 1842.
To IIis Excellency the Governor:
Dear Governor :?I was disappointed
in paying my respects to you at the
Camp, as I wished and intended ; but, to
convince you that I am not unmindful ot
you, permit me to send you specimens ol
Cotton Plants. They will show you what
44 Old Carolina"?"our own, our native
land" can do, when humored, and aided
by the proper means.
The cotton sent, grew upon land which
was purchased by my father, in 1814 or
'.5?cleared long before, from the name
he gave it, (" The Old Black Level,' )
- * A ^
and planted by him every year, up to
1832, in cotton, unaided, and since '32,
every year by me, in cotton, except one
year in corn, but assisted along with the
needful.
You would conclude, from the age and
culture of the land, that it was the worse
of wear, and needed aid?and from the
specimen* sent, that it had received it,
anil that liberally. My object 111 sending
you this cotton, and c illing \ onr attention
to the miprovciiient of our culture
and lards, is to enlist you in my ranks,
having drser **d \otirs, inasmuch as I
cannot now support j our favorite measure,
(Brigade Eiicamj meiits,) with my
wonted zeal.
I presume you have heard that my
opinions are changed, with regard to
Brigade Encampments, as I fcave expressed
ihem very freely. Now, as I may
receive an attack from you, when we
meet, I have thought it prudent to en.
trench myself behind my lavorite and
strong barrier, Agriculture.
I have come to the conclusion that the
week or ten days which many will he absent
from their homes in going to, remaining
at, nnd returning from camp,
might be better employed in the farm,
not to mention the strong argument
against the Encampment system. Its
o * v
effects in forcing many a clever fellow to
ra-.irrn nr not accent office. from inabdi.
?/ X. J
ty to attend the Encampments and he
absent-from home 90 lung. I mean, of
course, those whose circumstances cannot
stand the expense?those who have to
work themselves?to make and gather
their own crops. Of which class are many
fine and efficient officers. As for my own
part, I like the camp much?hut what is
pleasure, life to the officer who is able to
stand the expense, is death to the poor
man, whose means of support depend
upon his own personal exertions. In
other words, Encampments do not make,
but break many good officers. My opirU
ion now is, that it would he enough to
ensure an efficient militia, that the Brigadier
General he required to attend and
superintend Regimenal musters, and the
Colonel, Lieutenant Colonel, Major and
Adjutant of Regiments, he required to at.
tend and superintend Company drills.
Indeed, I am ultra enough, at times, to
think it would be almost sufficient that
our yeomanry should be well armed?
having arms, would ensure a knowledge
of their use; and as for the rest, we all
know that it is only necessary for a freeman
to think that bis country needs his
vigilance and other services, and he will
step forth at once, and with alacrity, an.
ticipating a call upon him.
Do not suppose that 1 am altogether
for Agriculture. I would not legislate
much upon the subject; but would let it
* alone, as much as the safety and defence
of the country would allow. I would
guard and protect it by amending such
enactments and unwholesome existing
laws, as trench upon or impe de its im-1
provement. Just think, if we should fail j
to improve the.opportunity which is now
at hand, (while Agriculture commands
the highest consideration and respect of
all classes,) tc stimulate and urge our
countrymen to bestir themselves?to reduce
agriculture to a science, and go ear.
nestly to work to reclaim our worn and
threadbare lands?should ice neglect it, |
what w ill lie th?* condition of our dear and
gallant State? W I'll our lands worn out, j
we will la; compelled to seek others that
will do more for? us. I repeat it, wha*
will be the condition of our dear anrf gat- ,
Innt State? She ui'l haw the extent
of territory, but few, comparatively, to
- possess and defend it. Let us then, turn
our attention to Agriculyire, the main
stay of our country, and i/s improvement
the salvation of our State.
Now is the time to strike for the pur.
suit?it should he upheh. with energv
And ze<fl; and as yot.r rIntra Mer and pos.
ition will give force and effect to whatever
you may say or do, I trust (hat we
shall have you as our leader, in udvocu.
tir.g such measures as may tend to support
our great and good cause.
In conclusion, let me add, that the
country must suffer, if a timely blow he
not struck for Agriculture. Within a
short time, I havo heard several worthy
citizens of Fairfield and Richland, speak
of the west with a feeling of regard
which I did not like, though at times, I
find myself with them (having strong
sympathies) almost concluding to go and
look at the land of promise myself.
For years, I have resisted the importu.
nities of relatives and friends, to quit our '
threadbare lands and seek others, thai
would do better for me. In reply, I have
always contended, that I could do better
here, all things considered, than elsewhere
; hut if otherwise, 1 would prefer a
competency in Carolina, Jo affluence in i
any other State. I would say, Carolina I
now and forever1. Let us first improve
%
her soil?she will then retain her own,;
and many will seek her as a home, and be ,'
proud to defend her.
Excuse my long letter, which was in.
tended at first, to be only a short note ;
hut when I mounted my hobby, he ran
off with me.
With great icspcct and esteem,
I remain truly yours, *
William J. Taylor.
From the Greenville Mountaineer.
Mr. Wells:?I request the favour of
you to insert the following correspond,
ence in your paper. With the hope of re.
moving the prejudice which exists against
j the expediency of Sunday Schools for the
religious instruction of colored population,
I have obtained the opinion of Gen.
Whitner, which I prcsentedto your read,
ers. It will settle, I trust, the question of
the legality oi such a School. The expediency
establishing them is-found by ex.

exclusively pursued through a large portion
of our State, and invariably attended wtih
good, and never with evil effects, so fnr
as I have been able to ascertain, after (
much inquiry on the subject. Perhaps
the best r< gulated plantation in tbe South,
ern States (Mr. Clav's, in Georgia) is that
mi which this system of instruction lias
been most thoroughly and .fully tested;
and many other witnesses might he brought
to testify to the moral improvement of their
Negroes under similar institutions. Nothnig
more is neeessary than an aequaintanee
with the system to remove from the
minds of the most sensitive, tbe imaginary
(lungers with which it is invested.
The follow ing is ibesuhsianee of a lei
ter addressed to Gen. Whitner :

n ' ??l#lr..^^ IVHI fl4 111*! Solid
IUCilV Kill 1 uuui vw j uu ??
tor of this Circuit, lor the purpose of ohMining
your legal opinion on the following
point: Early in the Just summer, 1
established, in Jhe Episcopal Church, a
Sabbath School for the instruction of the
blacks in the principles of the christian re
ligion. The instruction imparted is entirely
oral. The books used by the teach,
ers are Jones' Catechism" for the adult
classes, and Dr. Capers' small Gate.1
chim for the children. These two works
arc sanctioned by very general use among
the large Planters of our State. The
mode of instruction is exactly similar to
that used in many churches which I have
visited in the lower Districts.and the same
! in substance with that pursued by the Methodist
Missionaries in their extensive Mis.
sions upon the plantations on the seaboard.
The hour for assembling is 3 o'clock in
the afternoon. The doors are open to
any citizen who chooses to attend. . The
teachers are residents of the community,
and confine themselves to oral instruction,
as I can testify from a personal inspection
of the school every Sunday.
Notwithstanding these precautionary
arrangements, I regret to find that some
opposition exists to the school, and to the
mode of conducting it.?We are charge,
with violating the laws of the State in
spirit, if not in the letter, and encouraging
Negroes to read ; and the teachers have
been threatened with prosecution if they
persevered in their efforts to teach these
poor" the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The
only ground for this charge nppenrs to he
the fact, that some of the Negroes have
been in the streets with the books used in
the school, which they were carrying to
their owners who wished to give them religious
instruction during the week. *
Believing that our proceedings are perfectly
legal, and being satisfied that it is
according to the will of God that we should
) use this mode of instruction, which 1 think
theonl v efficient one foruneducated ininds.
I am yet sincerely desirous of showing all
proper respect for the laws of the State,
on this or any other subject. I therefore
i apply to you for your interpretation of the
! laws on this point. You will confer a fa
vor on me by an early answer, with the
privilege of using it as circumstances may
render expedient,
Very respectfully, your bh't. ser.v't.

Dear Sir:?1 feel ashamed that 1 have
not found an earlier moment to reply to
vo ir Ihvor ofthe 10th inst.
1 have had occasion, previously, to investigate
the Act of our Legislature on
iho subject respecting whicli you r*qti"st
mv opinion, and feel no hesitation in as
soring you that there has I wen no legisla
Hon to inv' knowledge, at all prohibiting
the kind of instruction or in inner of mi
parting it to the JS'? grocs, as practised ai

Free Negroes Ate. even in company with j
white persons to meet together nnd assemble
for the purpose of mental instruction
or religious worship,or either, before the j
rising of the sun and the going clown of (
the same."
The Act of 1803 prohibits the dtspei- ^
sion of such nn assembly before 44 nine ,
o'clock in the evening," provided a majority
of the assemblage were white persons,
or the disturbance of their devotion (
otherwise 4 unless upon warrant issued by g
a Magistrate.' The act of 1810, providing }
for the more effectual performance of Patrol
duty, observes like provisions. The
Act of 1SS4? prohibits the teaching of any j
slave to read or write, under heavy penal- ]
tics. J
So that frr.m oil that has b'en brought r
- t
within my observation, after a diligent
search into our entire stntute law, 1 con I
elude that the assemblage of Negroes in i
the day time, in an open place for oral in- <
struetion, is not unlawful. The Legisia- ,
ture seems indeed to have contemplated
the propriety of their being assembled lor
' * a! ?? i
the purpose " ot menial insirucuon ana
,4 religious worship!" other than in the
night timeand in secret places, whether
a majority of white persons were present
or not.
I have been greatly snrprsed with
the nature and extent of the prejudice and
apprehension existing in a christian community
on this subject. In the hands of
vicious and designing fanatics, our Negro
population might be greatly corrupted under
the guise of religious instruction ; but
that persons whose judgment and good
sense are confided in, whose habits, and
education, and interests are identical.'
and whose feelings and purposes are not
therefore to be brought in qucstion^should
be objects of suspicion whilst attempting
to point immortal brings the way to Heaven,
and this, too, in a land of Rihles.
amongst an intelligent, reflecting and
christian people, is to me most unaccountable.
It cannot be t hat religion is to he withheld,
fiorn the Negro because he is a
Slave. He is rational and immortal and
must he accountable, though his ncrmjii.
lability, he shares, I have no doubt,large.
lv, with Ins master. Some light is essential

there is nothing incompatible with the re

Notes on tiie Census.
We find the following interesting calculations
and notes on the recent census of the United
States, in a late Cincinnati paper. It is stated
that there occurs, between 15 and 25, one death
in 211; between 25 and 35, one death in 43 ; be.
twecn 33 and 45, one death in 76; between 45
and 55, one death in 54; between 55 and 65, one
death in 31; between 65 and 75, one death in
Id; between 75 and 85, one death in 125; be.
twecn 85 and 95, one death in 112; between 95
and 105, one death in 116.
The above shows a less proportion of deaths be.
tween 15 and 25, in proportion to those between
5 and 15 than the bills of mortality generally
show.
From the age of 35, the proportional number of
deaths continually increase, until at the age of
100 but few remain. The last census shows 759
persons above the age of 100. Notwithstanding
the great number of those who die young, yet
more than two hundred thousand white persons in
the United States are past the age of seventy.
The laws of life and mortality between the
----- ------ TK?? mm Im> t.-itcd
aiu ??? ^ ?? ? ?
thus;
1. In the present condition of the white population
of the United State#, the number of female#
born per annum are about twelve thousand less
than tho males. This determines of itself that
Polygamy is not a natural condition of man, and
that the laws of nature and religion are the same
?that one man shall be the husband of one wonian.
2. At twenty years of age, the females exceed
the males. This proves that between birth and
twenty, the mortality among the boys has been
much greater than that among the girls.
3. From twenty to forty, the iren again much
exceed the women, which shows that this is the
period of greatest mortality among women.
4. From forty to seventy, the difference rapidly
diminishes, the females, as in the early part of
life, gaining on the males. This shows that this is <
the period of greatest danger and exposure to men
?the least to women.
5. From seventy onwards, the women outnum- '
her the men. This shows, conclusively, that rc- **
lativcly speaking in comparison with men, the ^
healthiest period of female life is the close of it.?
Absolutely, however, no period to either sex, is so
healthy as that of youth, the blooming period of
boyhood and girlhpod.
The above deductions of statistical tables correspond
with every day observations on human ,
life. ; I
Women are exposed to peculiar hazards in the
middle of life ; but, in the long run, far the largest 1
part o" exposure, danger, and risk, in civilized na.
tions, fall on men in the active periods of life. I

from the French, with Notes adapting it tollif

La Fontaine's &c.
Agriculture is the foundation of all human
arts?tiie art for which man was made, and
the perfection c.f which is his chief happinos*
and glory as th?? lord temporal of th a planet*
Ot tins sublime art, all other arts and science*
are but satellites, their business being to wait
on, enlighten, and adorn it with their moon*,
shine. Consequently no man more nan the
agriculturist needs the full use of his brains,
and a perfect Co nin ?nd of all 'lie treasures of
human experience So thp farmers of the
Untied Slates view the matter; and in pie.
seu'iiig them with a translation of the celo.
brafed Maison Rustique, of the French, we
have no dount of their hearty support. It ic
the work of all works on practical agriculture
?the most scientific, clear, and c< mprehetisive,
France has long excelled in profitable
farming. This is. the source of her wealth.
England is rich hy coals and commerce. Her
agriculture is splendid, -but sometimes costs
more than it comes to. Those who have
fortunes to spend may buy the vast works "of
Marshall, Dickson Arthur Young, Loudon,
&c., hut those who wish to gel a fortune out
of the soil will find the French writers better
able to show thein the way. The excellence
ot French elementary works is well known to
all teachers. For centuries, the A/aison
Ru.*tique has been, in France, the standard
elementary work?the spelling book and
grammar of larming. The present edition for
" the nineteenth century," has been rew ritten
and brought up with the " march of mind/'
by sixty of the ablest ,4agronomes" of France.
It has all the light of the latest improvements,
not only in Frauce, but in all Europe.
William Cobber, one of the most successful
farmers both in England and America, who
wrote the best style and the best French
fjramruer that ever was, valued the Maison
Rustiques, not only as an encyclopedia of
farming, but us a means of educating his
children. He waB his own schoolmaster. In
' winter evenings his family resolved itself into
a school, and he thus speaks of the use then
made <>l tins work:?
4* Our book of never failing resource was
! the French Maison Rusi?que.or Farm House,
which, it is said, was the hook that first tempted
Dugnosnois (I think that was his name,)
thp famous physician in the reign of Louis
XIV., to learn to read. Here are all the fourlegged
animals, frotn the horse down fo the
mouse, portraits and all; all the birds, reptiles,
inserts* all the modes of rearing manafnnK.
and using the tame, ones, and of destroying
those that are mischievous; all the various
traps, springs, nets;all the labors of the field
and garden exhibited, as well as the rest, in
plates; and there was I, in any leisure moments,
tojuinthis inquisitive group, to read
the French, and tell thein what it meaned in
English, when the picture did not sufficiently
explain itself. I never have been without a
copy of this book for forty years, except during
the time that / was fleeing from the dungeons
of Castlercagh and Sidmouth, in 1817, and
when I got to Long Island, the first took 1
bought was another Maison Rustique.*'?Ad.

Of the qualification? of the translator, it may
