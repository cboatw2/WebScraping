THE SPIRIT OK BEAUTY.' *"
Whete docs tbe spirit of Beauty dwell?
Ob: said one, il' you seek to know, M
You must gaze around, above, below,
Far earth and beaten and ocean tell it
Where the Spirit of Beauty loves to dwell.
But ecc, she comes with the early spring ' .
And winnows tbe air with her fragrant wing, j f"
CioUiine the meadow, an J hill, and tree, j bt
In tbe bloom of her ncfa embroidery. fo
Ask her now ere she pats away * | ^
Mrth ?he deliehts to stay,
And the Spirit will paose, while earth and *k? l"
King with tone* of her glad reply?
44 See* for me in the bine hare-bell,
In the pearly depths of the ocean shell,
in the eaper flash of the dying day. .
I n the first faint glow of the morning ray; '
Islceo on the breast of ibe crimson rose tu
And bide in the stately lily's snows;
i am found where the crystal dew-drops shisc;
Ao gem so bright in a diamond mine;
1 bloom in the Bower that decks the grave,
And ride un the crest of the dark green ware,
I'm np and away o'er earth and o er sea,
Till there is not a spot from my presence free. ! ^
" I'm seen in the stars, in the leaf enshrined, , a'
And beard in ths sigh of the whispering wind, K
On the rifling breast of the winding stream, f
In the mellow glow ot the moon's mild beam, \
1 fan the air with the bird's light wing,
And lock in the grass of the fairy ring; M
Ms tents in the rainbow arch are set, ' kl
And X breathe in the fragrant violet; la
Look wberr you may, you will find we there, ' gr
For the spirit of Bcautj is every where. i cj
, " Sow listen to roe - For, sooth to say,
There is ono dear spot where 1 lain would stay, rt
1 tore all thing* in earth, sea, sky?
Bnt my own best home is a maiden's eye! ,
Oh! 1 could linger for ever there, w
Yet sigh for another, a sphere, wore false;
Lurking for aye in het cheeks warm sonic; g
Round tier raw lips with their playful wile,
Roving at will tbrongh each golden carl,
That waves o'er a brow like an Indian pearl,
And sinking at night to a blissful rest
X'id the. spotless snows of bet fragrant breast. jf
Seek for ine there foe I love full well
With the young and the bright eyed maid to dwell. ^
? " And look Car me in the pool's mind,
Wbcrr 1 he like a radiant gem enshrined;
Towelling each thought like the rose's glow
That falls on the roar hie fount below;
Filling the soul with an inward light,
A love for all the* ? pure and bright, tr
Till the mind where the rays of toy spirit burn,
Glows like the lines on a crystal urn;
.tad a thousand beauties till ibrn unseen, "
Flash into light on the Fancy's screen,
While thoughts that the many pass heedless by j tc
Are stored in the heart's deep treasury.
" Know ye now where t love to dwell* ^
The mind is happy that feels my sprU;
Blest in its bright imaginings,
It soars aloft upon fancy's wings ?
O'er earth, in beaten, In sea or akr,

From the Churchman. ! y
YY'Aaf is Death.??Of death itself tre ' lr
know nothing. Although permitted to D
nm.n,lt within ii< shadow, tve are in no- w
~ry?
rant of the reality. We may cunrcrsc
with the dying; we may ourselves be pi
brought to the verge of the grave, but the tr
sublime mystery of death remains unfa-: pi
tbonted. The impenetrable darkness _
which has ever rested upon us, continues < d<
until the pang that gives rent to the spirit, j al
imparts also l:fele??ncss to the bodv. 1 pi
But what is death as its respects the: ?
present hfef 11
It is a peri d of humiliation: hi
It is a period of anguish. sj
It is the termination of every thing. oj
It is a period of humiliation. The
proud, the haughty, the ambitious; the J?
mighty schemer, the high, the rich, the j it
gifted intellect, all are brought down on j it
a level with the bumble aud obseure.? Jcj
The lofty eminence for which they stroTt,, u
now, in the hour of death, rises up before 1 u
them, bearing upon its base of sand the
atamj? of vanity. The applause of the
multitude, which once waa the pendulum a
of their very action, appears now in its
irno light, a fickle brcatli. The glory j a;
and putnp of the world, its pleasures, its;
hopes and its promises, which a short j*
time since glistened with the bril-j
Jianey ol a diamond, hare become dull n
and valueless. "They are High onto
death;" they arc realizing the troth of p
that text of Scripture which declares that
" the fashion of this world jiassclh away.'* ?
It is a period of anguish. The pains of
a diseased body, together with the suflc- b
'rings of a harrowed mind/cannot but;
produce anguish. In health and prospe-\s
rity reflection may bo drowned amid a u
thousand circutnrtanncs which on a dying1
bed are beyond control. It is in the lost e
hour that we ore driven, o<* it were, upon ' fi
ourselves. There is 1:0 escape from d
thought?it goes buck orcr the past like n
whirlwind, tears up the long-forgotten
deeds of iniquity and folly, and brings t
them out upou the memory as fresh and '
vigorous as llic things of yesterday. ! \
It is the termination of crery thing, t
Death is truly, as it respects the pi event I
existence, the end of every thing. In 1
the vegetable, as iu the animal world, it <
ii the closo of life. i 1
But what is death as it .respects the :
world to come? i
It is a lime of triumph. . I
It ts a time of joy and happiness.
It is the beginning of all things. 1;
It is a time of triumph. In the pros- \
]?ccls of death the soul shudders, but in|,
view of eternal life it rises triumphant: |
the gloom of the grave breaks away be- j j
fore the piercing eye oj faith, and the j 1
fainting spirit* refreshed as it draws nearer |
to tiod, stands up strong ami undaunted ;
before the great destroyer. In the very <

to him, and to Zavala, Burnet and Vcblcin,
who followed. These last selected the district
