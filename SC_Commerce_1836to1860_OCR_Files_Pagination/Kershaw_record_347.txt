the embarrassment of commerce, and expansion
anil derangement of the currency,
and, let rue add, what lias been so much
dreaded by the friends of manufactures,
the mighty increase of the exports of our
great agricultural staple during the same
period; a clear proof that under the free
trade system, the one dors not interfere
with the other, Let no friend of manufac
turrs suppose that this interesting result
is accidental. It is the operation of fixed
laws, steady and immutable in their course,
as I shall hereafter show.
Now, sir, I feel myself, with these facts,
warranted in asserting that if the dt-ranged
state of the currency had not interfered,
the great manufacturing interest would
have gone on in a flourishing condition
during the whole period of the reduction
under the compromise act, proving thereby
to the satisfaction of all, the fallacy of
the protective system. Any supposed loss
from the reduction of duties, would have
been more than made up by the increased
ability of the South and West to consume,
and the rapidly growing importance of
the foreign market.
But I have not yet done with the system.
It has additional and heavy sins to, answer
for. The tariff of '23 is the source in
which has originated that very derangement
of the currency, which so greatly
OmOarrU35es, HI una luuc, wv. .V.J ......
est it was intended to protect, as well as
other branches of industry. Bold as is
the assertion, I aip prepared to establish it
to the letter.
It has already been proved that the great
expansion of the currency in '29, '30, and
'31, was the immediate effect of the tariff
of'28. It remains to be shown that the
cause of the still greater and longer continued
expansion which has terminated in
the overthrow of the banking system, and
the deep and almost universal distress of
the country, may be clearly traced back
to the same source. To do this, wc must
rclnrn to the year '32, and trace the chain
of events to this time. In that year, the
u'ae fin? 11 v disrhnroed. The
r,"",v uvi" c ?
vnst revenue which hail been poured into
the Treasury by the tariff of '2$, and
which had accelleraled the payment of
the public debt, could, after its discharge,
no longer be absorbed in the ordinary expenditures
of the Government, and a surplus
began to accumulate in the Treasury.
The late Bank ol the United States was
then the fiscal agent of the Government,
and the depository of its revenue. Its
growing amount, and prospects of great
future increase, began to act on the cupidity
of many of the leading State banks
and ?ome of the great brokers of New
York. Hence their war against that institution;
and hence, also, the removal of
the deposites. The late President I believe
to have been really hostile to the
Bank on principle; but there would have
been little or no motive to remove them,
had it not been for their growing importance,
and the hostility which the desire
of possessing them had excited. They
were removed, and placed in the vaults
of certain State banks. To this removal
and deposile in the State banks, the mem1

tributing all the disorders of the currency
which have since followed. Now I ask,
in the first place, is it not certain, if it
had not been for the surplus revenue, the
deposites would not have been removed7
And, in the second, if there would have
been a surplus had it not been for the taliff
of '28?
Again: is it not equally clear that it was
the magnitude of the surplus, and not the
removal, of itself, that caused the after
derangement and disorder? If the surplus
had beeu but two or three millions, the
ordinary sum in the deposite, it would

was kept; whether in the vaults of the
Bank of the United States, or those of the
States; but involving, as it did, tifty millions
and more, it became a question of
the highest importance. I again ask, to
what is this great surplus to be attributed,
but to the same cause? Ye6, sir, the tariff
of 1829 caused the surplus the removal
ond all the after disasters in the currency,
aggravated, it is true, by being deposited
in the State banks; but it may be doubted
whether the disaster would have been
much less, had they not been removed.?
Be that, however, as it may, it is not material,
as I have shown, that surplus itself
was the motive for the removal. *Ve all
remember what occurred after the removal.
Tho surplus poured into the Treasury
by millions, in the form of bank
notes. Tho withdrawal from circulation,
? ? ? - -I-- !.~ ..C .k ? .1 . ..
nnu locking up in mc vuuuo m mc ui-jiusite
bunks, so large ati amount, created I
an immense vacuum, to be replenished by
repeating the issues which gave to the
banks the means of unbounded accommodations.
Speculation now commenced on
a gigantic scale; pi ices rose rapidly, and
one pa ty, to make the removal acceptab'e
to the people, urged the new depositories
to discount freely, v.bile the other
side produced the satne effect, I y censuring
tftcm for not affording as ex!cfl-<:ivc ?c
eommodations as the Dank of the United J
States would have done, had ihe revenue
been left with it. Madness ruled the hour. |
The whole community was intoxicated!
with imaginary prospects of realizing im- j
tnense fortunes. With the increased rise
of prices began the gigantic speculations
in the public domain, the price of which,
being fixed by law, could not partake of
the jreneral rise. To enlarge the room
lor their operations, I know not how many
millions (fifty, I would suppose, a?.
least, of the public revenue) was sunk in
purchasing Indian lands, at their fee simple
price nearly, and removing tribe after
tribe to the West, at enormous cost; thus
subjecting millions on millions of the
choicest public lands to be seized on by
the keen and greedy speculator. The tide
now swelled with irresistible force. From
the banks the depositcs passed by discounts
into the hands of the land speculators;
from them into the hands of the receivers,
and thence to the banks; and again and
again repeating the same circle, and, at
every revolution, passing millions of acres
of the public domain from the people intn
the hands of speculators, for worthless
rags. Had this state of things continued
much longer, every acre of the public
lands, worth possessing, would have pass'
ed from the Government. At this stage
..t , ????? ?.a?

j attempted to be squandered by the wildest
J extravaprance; resolutions passed this bo^
) dy, calling on the Departments to know
how much they could spend, and mucl
resentment was felt bccaUse they couli
not spend fast enough. The deposite aci
i was passed, and the Treasiny circular is
sued: but, as far as the currency was con
cerned, in vain. The explosion followed
and the banks fell in convulsions, to be
resuscitated for a moment, but to fal
again from a more deadly stroke, undei
which they now lie prostrate.
I have now presented, rapidly, the un
broken chain of events up to thc.prolifit
source of our disasters, and down to the
present time. In addition to the cause:
| originating directly in the tariff of 1828
1 there were several collateral powerful
| ones, which have contributed to the preni-nrlfiiifiil
/.fin il if i n n fif lllft MirrPnTl
j OUJJI> pi vgu UtVU WI?U(?I VII w* V ^
! and the banks, but which would have been
: comparatively harmless of themselves.?
j Among these was the important change in
! the character of the Bank of England, at
j the last renewal, about the time our sur'
plus revenue began to accumulate, by
which its notes were made a legal tender
in all cases, except between the b.ink and
its creditors. The obvious effect of this
modification was to diminish the demand
j for specie in that great mart of the world,
and, in consequence, must have tended
powerfully to keep the exchange with tii
in an easy condition, while the tide of circulation
was rapidly rising to a dangerous
height. But there was another cause
which contributed still more powerfully to
the same result: 1 reier to tue great loans
negotiated abroad by States and corporations.
To these I add the operation of
: the United States Bank of Pennsylvania,
I the direct object of which, in some of its
more prominent transactions, was to prej
vent the exchange from becoming adverse
I to us.
By the operation of these causes comI
bined, the exchanges were kept easy for
years, notwithstanding the vast expansion
which our circulation had attained, from
the powerful action of the more direct
causes to which I have adverted. The
stroke wus delayed, but not averted, and
fell but the heavier and more fatally, because
delayed. And where did it fall,
; when it came, most heavily? Where the
1 measure which caused it originated; on
the heads of its projectors. Behold how
1 error, folly, and vice, in the ways of an
1 inscrutable Providence, turn back on their
authors.
I< is full time for the North, and more
especially for New England, to pause and
nonder. If they would hear the voice of
one who has ever wished them well, I
. would say that the renewal of tho protective
system would be one of the greatest
1 calamities that could befall you. What
ever incidental good could be derived from
it, you have already acquired. It would,
' if renewed, prove a pure, unadulterated
'evil. The very reverse is your true polij
cy. The great question for you to decide
is, how to command the foreign market.
'The home market, of itself, is too scanty
I for your skill, your activity, your energy,
your unequalled inventive powers, your
} untiring industry, your vastly increased
j population, and accumulated capital.?
I Without the foreign market, your unexampled
march to wealth and improvement
must come to a stand. How, then, are,
you to obtain command of the foreign
market.' That is the vital question.
The first and indispensable step is. a
thorough reformation of the currency.?
Without a solid, stable, and uniform currency,
you never can fully succeed. The
present currency is incurably bad. It-is
impossible to give solidity or stability. A
convertible bank currency, however well
regulnled, is subject to violent and sudden
changes, which must forever unfit it to
I be the standard of value. '* It i? by far the
most sensitive to every change, cummer[
cial or political, foreign or domestic; as
j may be readily ilustratcd by rcfcrrcncc to
; the ordinary action of foreign exchanges
I on such currency. For this purpose, let
us assume that our ordinary circulating
medium, when exchanges are easy, amounts
to ?100.000,000, consisting, as it
does, of convertible bank paper. Let us
suppose that it is all issued by what arc
[ called sound specie paving banks, with a
circulation of three dollars .of .paper for
one dollardn^pccie, which is reganlexl ^s.
constituting safe banking. Next, suppose
exchange abroad turns against us, to the
amount of 810,000,000. Is it not clear,
that instead of reducing the.circulation by
that amount, that is, to 890,000,000,
which it would do if it consisted only of
specie, it would be reduced three times
the amount; that is, to 870,000,000? Let
. us now suppose the exchange to turn the
i other way, from this point of depression,
| and to be kept flowing in that direction till
it came to be 810,000,000 in our favor, instead
of that amount against us. The re!
suit would be, under the operation of the
jsame law, not to increase our circulation
to f"JI IO,UUU,UUU only, which would be the
case if consisting of specie, but to 8130,000,000;
making a difference between the
extreme points of depression and elevation
of 860.000,000?more than equal to
one-half of the usual amount of circulation
by supposition, with a corresponding in,
crease of prices?instead of 820,000,000,
equal only to a Hfth, ami with but a pro.
portional effect on prices. A change the
i other way, from the extreme point of ele?
vation to that of extreme depression,
? would cause the reverse effect. I hold ii
I certain that no honest industry, pursued
; with the view to moderate and steady pro
'fit, can be*" safe in the midst of such sud5
den and violent vicissitudes?vicissitudes
? as if from summer to winter, and fron
l winter to summer, without the interven
tion of full or spring. Such great am
' sudden changes in the standard of valui
i must be particularly fatal with lis, will
1 our moderately accumulated capital, com
t pared to the elFect on the greater accurnu
- lation abroad, in older countries. In stat
ing the case supposed. I have assumec
, numbers at random, without pretending
! to accuracy as applied to our country
I simply to illustrate the principle. Th(
: actual vibration may be greater or Icsj
than that supposed, but in every country
where bank circulation prevails, it mus
: be greater and greater, just in proportioi;
? to the extent of its prevalence*
> For ibis diseased slate of your curroil,

I return to the currency of the Constitution
Head that instrument, and hear what il
r says. "Congress shall coin money and
i regulate the value thereof; no State shall
emit hills of credit, or make any thing
i but gold and silver a legal tender." Ilere
; are positive and negative provisions; a
grant of power to Congress, and a limitation
on the power of the States, in refer
dice to the currency Can you doubt thai
I the object was to give to Congress the
i controi of the currency? What else is the
meaning " to regulate" the value thereof!
Can you doubt that the currency was intended
to be specie? What else is the meani
ing "to coin money?" Can.you doubt,
on the other hand, that it was the intention
that the States should not supercede
I the currency which Congress was authorized
to establish? What else is thtf meaning
of the provisions that they shall not
I issue bills or credit,* or make any thing
but gold and silver a legal tender? Can we
doubt, finally, that the country is not in
the condition that the Constitution intend
ed, as l'ar as the currency is concerned?
Does Congress, in point of fact, regulate
the currency? No. Does it supply a coin
circulation? No. Do the Stales, in fact,
regulate it! Yes. Does it consist of paI
per, issued by the authority of the States?
Yes; Is this paper, in effect, a legal tender?
Yes, it has expelled the currency of
| the Constitution, and we arc compelled to
j take it or nothing. Well, then, as the
! currency is in an unconstitutional condition,
the conclusion, is irresistible that
'the Constitution has failed to effect what
it intended, as far as the currency is con'cerned;
but whether it has failed" by misconstruction,
or the want of adequate
provisions, is not yet decided. Thus
much, however, is clear; that it is through

ed, and the power intended to be conferred
on Congress over the currency has
been superseded. But for that, the power
of Congress over tha currency would have
been this day in full force, and the currency
itself in a constitutional condition.?
Nor is it less clear, that the Constitution
cannot be restored, while the cause which
has superseded it remains; and this presents
the great question, how can it be removed?
I do nut intend to discuss it on
this occasion. I shall only say, that the
task is one of great delicacy and difficulty,
requiring much wisdom and caution, and
in the execution of which precipitation
ought to be carefully avoided; but when
executed,, then, and not till then, shall we
have the solid, stable, and uniform cttr?
' -I
rcncy intcnnea oy uic ^ousiiiunun, aim
which is indispensible, not only to the full
success of our manufactures, and all other
branches of productive industry, but also
to the safety of our free institutions.
The next indispensable step to secure to
the manufacturers the foreign market, is
low duties and light burdens on productions;
ves, as low and light as the wants
of the Government will permit: The less
the burdea?the freeer and broader the
scope given to the products of our manufactures?the
better for then). Above all,
avoid the renewal of the protective sys*
* - ? / iL- i*._
tem. It would be fatal, us tar as me ioreign
maiket is concerned.
Its hostile effects I have already shown
from the tabic of exports; and shall now,
by a few brief remarks, prove that it must
be so. Passing by other reasons, I shall
present but one, but that one decisive.?
It has been shown that the effect of the
protective system is to c.vpand the currency
in the manufacturing sections, until the
increased price of production shall become
equal to the duty imposed tor projection,
when the iijinartaljon of. I he., pro-.
tccted articles most again take place; that,
is to say, that its effects are to enable foreign
manufacturers to meet ours in our
own country, under the disadvantage of
paying high additional duties. How, then,
with that result, would, it be possible for
our manufacturers to meet the foreign fabrics
of the same description abroad,
where there can be no duty to protect
them? There can be no unswer. The reason
is decisive. I do not wish, in what I
have said, to be considered the advocate
of low wages I\tm in favof of high wages;
and agree that the higher the wa?es, the
ctrnmrop tlio evidence of nrusDeritv: nro
- * f, i *'m
vided (and that is the important point)
they are so naturally, by the effectiveness
of industry, and not in consequence of
an inflated currency, or any artificial regulation.
When I say the effectiveness
of industry, I mean to comprehend whatever
is calculated to make the labor of one
, country more prodoclive than that ol
others. I take into consideration skill,
i activity, energy, invention, perfection ol
instruments and means, mechanical and
, chemical; abundance of capital, natural
t ana acquired; facility of intercourse anil
I exchanges, internal and external, and, it:
a word, whatever may add to the produc
tiveness of labor. High wages, when at
s tributable to these, is the certain evidence
1 of productiveness, and is, on that account
- and that only, the evidence of prosperity
I It is easily understood. Just as such la
; bor would command, when compared will
i the less productive, a greater numbir o
- pounds of sugar or tea, a greater quantity
of clothing or food, in the same propor
-? .i....
-jtion would it command more specie, ma
l,is, higher wages, for a day's work. Cut
fisir, here is the important consideration
, [high wages from such a cause, require ni
y. protection ? no, not more than the higl
i i wages of a man against the low wages o
r|a boy, of man against woman, or ths
t skillful and energetic against the awkwari
i and feeble. On the contrarj, the highei
such wages the less the protection rcquir
cd. Others may demand protection agains
> it?not it against others. The very de
. niand of protection, then, is but a confes
t sion of the want of effectiveness of laboi
I (from some cause) on the side that make*
I it; but, as a general rule, it will tu.n oui
I! that protection, in most cases, is a mere
> fi.laev: certainly so when its effects are an
i: artificial expansion of the currency. Sc
far arc high wages from being ihccvidenct
; of prosperity, in such eases, or, in fact,
t( whenever caused by hi^h protection, higl
i taxes, or any other artificial cause, it if
>j the evidence of the very reverse, and al1
ways indicates something wrong, or a tendency
to derangement and decay.
Having arrived at this conclusion, 1
will now hazard the assertion, that in nc
country on earth is labor, taking it all it
all, more effective than ours; and especially
in the Northern and Eastern por
tions. What people can excel our Northern
and New England bret: ren in skill,
invention, activity, energy, pcrsevercnce,
and enterprise? In what portion of the
I globe will von find a posilion more lavoraj
blc to a free ingress and egress; and l'acili
ly of intercourse, external and internal,
through the broad limits of our wide
spread country?a region surpassed by
! none, taking into consideration extent and
fertility? Where will you find such an
abundant supply of natural capital, the
f gift of a kind Providence; lands cheap,
' plenty and fertile; water power unlimited;
| and the supply of fuel, and the inosl useful
metals, iron, almost without stint. It
j is true, in accumulated capital, the fruits
.of past labor, through a long snccession
j of ages, not equal to some other countries,
but even in that, far from being deficient,
! and to whatever extent deficient, would
I be more than compensated by the absence
of all restrictions, and the lightness of the
burden imposed on labor, should our Government,
State and General, wisely avail
themselves of the advantages of our situation.
If these views be correct, there
is no country where labor, if left to itself,
free from jestfiction, would be more effective,
and where it would command greater
abundance of every necessary and cornfort,
or higher wages; and where, of
course, protection is less needed. Instead
of an advantage, it must, in fact, prove
un impediment. It is high time, then,
, that the shackles should be throwu off industry,
and its burden lightened, as far as
the just wants of the Government may possibly
admit. We have arrived at the manhood
of our vigor. Open the way?remove
all restraints?take oil' the svvaddiins"
cloth that bound the limbs of infan
cy, and let the hardy, intelligent and enterprising
sons of New England, march
forth fearlessly to meet the world in competition,
and she will prove, in a few
years, the successful rival of old England:
The foreign market once commanded, all
conflicts between the different sections and
industry of the country would cease. It
is better for us and you, that our cotton
should go out in yarn and goods, than in
the raw state; and when that is done, the
interests of all the parts of this great confederacy?North,
East, South, and West
1 ?with every variety of its pursuits, would
1 be harmonized; hut not till then. If the
course of policy I advocate be wise as applied
to manufactures, how much more
strikingly so must it be when to the other
i two great interests of that section, commerce
and navigation? I pass the former,
and shall conclude what I intended to snyj
ion this point, with a few remarks appli-j
'cable to the latter. Navigation (I mean;
j that employed in our foreign trade) is cs-l
sentiully our outside interest, exposed toi
the open competition of all the world.?!
It has met, successfully, the competition j
of tire 'Io'.rcsf only without j
protection, but with heavy burdens oft alnvosl
every arrticle that enters into the outfit,
the rigging, and construction of our
noble vessels, the timber excepted. If,
witli such onerous burdens, it has met in
successful rivalry the navigation of all
other countries. What an impulse it
' would receive if the load that bears down
; its spring were removed! and what im
mense additions that increased impulse
would give, not only to our wealth, but
to the means of national influence and
safety, where only we can be felt, and in
the quarter from which only external danIfjer
is to be apprehended!
I have now, Mr. President, concluded
what I proposed to say, when I rose to
address the Senate. I have limited my
remarks to the prominent consequences,
in a pecuniary and fiscal view, which
would result, should the scheme _qI as ?*
sumption be adopted, There are higher,
" and still more important, consequences,
which I have not attempted to trace: I
' mean the effects, morally and politically-^
I as resulting from those which I have
I traced, and presented to the Senate.?
I This, 1 hope, may be done by some other
i Senator, in the course of the discussion.
But I have said enough to show that the
