appointed Collector of the port of Phila

satisfaction to the friends of the adminis

In the Senate yesterday, there, was some
conversation upon the resolution for the
adjournment of Congress, on the 18th
May, which ended in the postponement
of the resolution for a fortnight. It was
evident, however, from what was said,and
from otier indication that Congress will
sit till July.
The North Eastern Boundary question
is also. to occupy much attention. It has
been communicated to.' the British Gov.
ernment that this government regards the
nilitary preparations on the Temisconta,
&C., as an infraction of the arrangement
made last winter; and, farther, the British
are now in possession of the report of their
own exploration party as to the actual
boundary line, and, from these circum
stances, it is conjectired that, in the course
of two months, or before, we shall know
whet her Great Britain is sincere or not in
her professions of a desire to settle this
diillctilty. If she is not, we must see what
next is to he dlone. If, as is stated, there
are now some forty thousand of the best
British troops, in Canada and New Bruns
wick, they will have the advantage of us
in the beginning of a scratch,-to say
nothing of their naval preparations. It
would be folly for us to declare War or to
take any course that would provoke a wnr,
for, as was said yesterday, no proposition
has been made to add a ship to the Navy
or a regiment to the army.

Jersey is no fully represented.
Mr. King, of Georgia, made his speech
against the Treasury Note bill, and gen
erally against the policy of the Adminis
tration in regard to the currency.
There is a pressing demand for this
supply, and the necessities of the govern
meut are too urgent to allow of any longer
delay in the passage of the bill. Befotie
the first ofApril, some of the obligations of
the government will fail to be redeemed,
unless the hill, by that time, should be
passed. There is a strong disposition to
bring itito this discussion the general ,po
litical and financial state of the currency.
Mr. Cushing threw out some views of a
very interesting character, at the close of
his remnrks, yesterday. They are asjust
as they are important. as every person of
observationcantestify. Ilesaid thiscoun
try was in the crisis of a great change not
merely ofan administration, but of its gen
eral policy. The evidence of it were not
seen here, but thechange was visible in
the public mind throughout the country.
The condition of things was now, what it
was in 1784;-we had a disordered curren
cy,-the states burdened with debt; and
the agricultural, commercial, and manu
lacturing interests were prostrated. Out of
this state of thiigs a change must come,
and one that no party or sectional interests
could control. Of course, he means an
assumption of state debts-a high tarifi'--a
national bank-a bankrupt law-and a na
tional debt,

There are rumors about the Capitol of
trouble with England. It is stated that
the correspondence between Mr. Fox and
Mr. Forsyth, in relation to the British
military preparations at Temisconia, be
caine "rather particular," as they say
"down east," and that Mr. Fox, before
answering any more questions, claims
time to communicate with his government.
Wiat is most remarkable about this mat

business-among any dozetn whom you

majority of the legal votes. We learn
frotm New Jersey, that the decision of the
House, has heeni received with the most
lively demotstrations of gratification by
the majority oft the people, and that the, ef
fect of the struggle will be favorable to the
interests of the adlministration party there.
The Hottse refused to set aside the pri
vate orders for the purpose of taking up the
Treasury'note bill. The Government will
be driven to atl sorts orstifrts and expedi

a law.
There is much excitement in regard to
the North-Eastern Boundary question.
The Secretary of State is engaged in a
very wartm controversy with the British
Minister, Mr. Fox, on the subject, and it
is said that Mr. Fox, in his last letter, as
snned a very high, and menacing tone.
The matter must soon come to a crisis.

account of the aamunoth Bride Cake of
the British Queen, vill be read with in

America,. ahough' we have no doubt they
will be satisfied with less cake and more
comfort than usually fall to the lot of royal
brides.
6 Her Majesty's Bride Cake.-This
mignificent piece of confectionary, weighs
300 Ihs., of which 270 lbs. were eatable,
dreamable, &c.: It is the composition of
Mr. J. C. 51awditt, first yeoman confec
tioner to her Majesty, who has crowned
his work with a sculptured allegory in
statuary sugar. A comely youth, clad in
a tunic and distinguished only by his mous
tache, gives his hand to a fairy queen,
bearing a sceptre and a crown, at the al
tar, while Minerva (assuming the trident
and spear of Britannia,) presides over and
consecrates their union. Around the base
of the dais, on which the happy couple
join their hands, three little Cupids and
Pysches (one pair hearing a rose, another
a shamrock, and the third a thistle,) seem
emulously imitativo of the excellent ex
ample.
This cake is solely for the Queen's ta
ble, for the dejeune, at Buckingham Pal
ace. Its weight is 300 pounds, and the
materials of which it is composed, cost
100 guineas, anti it required fourstout men
to remove it to its place on the table.

Melanch6ly Accident.--The steamer
Commerce, ,the mail boat between Chat
tahoochee and Apalachicola) burst her
boilers on the night of the 41 inst, killing
both Eigineers, several deck hands, and
one or two passengers, and scalding se
verely- many of the crew. The explo
sion was one of terrific violence, occurring
at the instant of stopping the engine.
Whether any, or at whose doqr the blame
should be laid, has not yet been ascertain
ed. The exertions or the ollicers and own
ers of the boats to alleviate the sufferings of
the wounded were, we are told, prompt
and humane. This is the first occurrence
of the kind on this river, and we hope that
the melancholy lesson it teaches will not
be lost upon those engaged in its navi
gation.
The Massachusetts Legislature have
ordered to he engrossed. a bill, repealing
the law against the inter marriage of whites
anid blacks. Among the arguments used
for the repeal were that no other State in
the Union, has such a law on its Statute
Book, and that public sentiment is a suf
ficient preventive in the case, without
legislation-can it be possible, that there
is an under current-something more
than meets the eye or ear in this matter

sighing for Othellos?-Char. Cour.

Vegetable Life Medicines.
T HESE Medicines are indebted for
their name to theit manifest and sen
sible action in purifying the springs and
channels of life, and enduing thera with
renewed tone and vigor. In many hun
dred certified cases which have been made
public, and in almost every species of dis
ease to which the human frame is liable,
the happy efects of MOFFATS LIFE
PILLS AND PHGNIX BITTERS
have been gratefully and publicly ac
knowledged by the persons benefitted, and
who were previously unacquainted with
the beautifully philosophical principles
upon which they are compounded, and
upon which they consequently act.
The LIFE MEDICINES recommend
themselves in diseases of every from & de
scription. Their first operation is to loosen
from the coats of the stomach and bowels,
the various impurities atd crudities con
stantly settling around them, and to re
move the hardened fmces which collect in
the convolutions of the small intestines.
Other medicines only partially cleanse
these and leave such collected masses
behind as to produce habitual costiveness,
with all its train of evils, or sudden diarr
hoa, with its imminent dangers. This
fact is well known to all regular anato
mists, who examine the human bowels
after death; and hence the prejudice of
these well informed men against quack
medicines-or medicines prepared and
heralded to the public by ignoraut persons.
The second 6ffect of the Life Medicines is
to cleanse the kidneys and the bladder,
and by this means, the liver and the lungs,
the healthful action of which entirely de
pends upon the regularity of the urinary
organs The blood, which takes its red
color from the agency of the liver and the
lungs before it passes into the heart, being
thus parified by themn, and .nourished by
food coming from a clean stomach, cour
ses freely through the veines, renews every
part of the system, and triumphantly
mounts the banner of health in the bloom
ing cheek.
Moffat's Vegetable Life Medicines have
been thoroughly tested, and pronounced a
sovereign renteily for Dyspepsia, Flatu
lency, Palpitation of the Heart, Loss of
Appetite, Heartburn and Headach. Rest
lessness, Ill-temper, An ' t, Languor and
Melancholy, Costivene rrhoa, Chol
era, Fevers of all 'Rheumatism
Gout, Dropsiesof all k ravel, Worms,
Asthma and Consum Scurvy, Ulcers,
Inveterate Sores, Scobutic Eruptions and
Bad Complexions, Eruptive complaints.
Sallow, Cloudy, and other disagreeable
Complexions, Salt Rheum, Erysipelas,
Common Colds and Influenza, and various
other complaints which afflict the huinan
frame. In FiYvER and AGUF, particular
ly, the Life Medicines have been most
eminently successful so much so, that in
the Fever and Ague districts, Physicians
almost universally prescribe them.
All that Mr. Moffat requires of his pati
entsis to be particular in taking the Life
Medicines strictly according to the direc
tions. It is not by a newspaper notice, or
by anything that fie himself may say in
their favor, that he hopes to gain credit.
It is alone by the results of a fair trial.
