This valuable medicine, the result of twenty
years' experience and unparralleled success in the
extensive and highly respectable practice of the
proprietor, patronised by the faculty aod nobility,
is now introduced to the notice o! the American
public, at the earnest solicitation of a nuraler of
Sentlcmen of long and high standing in the p.o>s?ion.
It is hoped, as'a preliminary step, to
check the evils and fatal conseque ces arising
from the use of the nnmsious deleterious nostrums
foisted upon the public by the aid of fabricated
proofs of miraculous cures, and other frauds, by a
set of mercenary, unpriacidied pretenders, so to
tally ignorant ot medical science tbat it is impnetihte
thfe monstrous delusion can any longer go
down with the intelligent people of this country.
These pills, mild ana agreeable in their nature,
s.iould be kept in every family in cases of sudden j
illness, for by their prompt administration, chole
ra, cramps, spasms, 'evers, and other alarming
complaints, which too often prove fatal, may be
speedily cured or prevented. In fact, all those
who value good health nhonld never be without
them. They ore sold in packets, at 50 cents, M

and vendor of medicine in the United States

PATENT COTTON GIN.
HIS Gin can bp made double, or single. II
ruade double, they reduce labor, and gin just
double, the quantity of cotton over the single cylinder
Gin, no other knd having been in use prevous
to this patent; and whether single or double, they
are found to improve the quality of the cotton, by
more perfectly cleaning it. They can be made to
contain from 2U to 100 saws in n stand, and whether
small or large. (Hie hand will be auflicient to attend
them. The Gins have mechanical feeders and
hoppers attached to them, which free the cotton
from leaves, trash, dirt, &.c. before it can teach the
saws, and by the thorough hackling operation it
receives from tho feeders, which make two revolutions
to one of the saws, it is almost in a half
rrined stale, before it descends to the saw. Uy a
very simple arrangement of a screw to'each set of
mantes, on which the hoppers rest, ai^ through
which the teeth of the feeders pass, tney can be
made to teed slow or fast to suit the condition of
Lhe cotton at the lime. When made double, the
saws are placed on two sets of cylinders and turn
upon each other in opposite directions, und arc
cleansed by two sets of brushes that have four revolutions
to one of twe saw. The two cylinders can
De aeiacnea so as 10 enable tue planter to run one
or both at pleasure, although embraced with feeders.
&c. in one stand. The whole is put in operation
with a drum and band, as in the ordinary Gin, and
may be propelled by horse, steam, or wuter power.
It may also be propelled by iron running gear.
The torce required to work it, is about the same as
that necessary to move an equal number of saws in
the common Gin. This Gin has been put in
operation in New Orleans for two or three weeks,
and its success tested in the presence of a large
number of planters, merchants and others, and
received their general approbation.
Several gentlemen have been so kind as to give
the Patentee their written opinion lespccting the
merits of the Gin. A number of others could be
added, but the following are deemed sufficient:
From his Excellency Gov. While of Louisiana..
New Orleans, Feb. 27,1837.
Dr. A. Jones?Sir, In reply to your enquiry,
what I think of your improved Cotton Gin, 1 have
to say, that I suw it work on Saturday the 25th inst.
and was very much pleased with its performance.
The mere fact of its self-feeding, seems to mo to
be e very valuable improvement; and besides, the
quality of the cotton, an it comes out of the pro*
cess, appeared to me to be belter and cleaner than
from the common Gins In use, and that it saves
considerably in labor. Respectfully, &c.
E. D. WHITE.
From Mr J. Compton, a wealthy planter, resident
in the Parish of Rapide, Louisiana.
Dr. Jones?Dear Sir, 1 have examined your Patent
Cotton Gin, with feeders, &c. And have
seen it in operation, and approve of it so highly,
that i have taken tho liberty of ordering one for
my plantation in time for the next crop.

exhibits a decided improvement on the usual process
of ginning ; delivering the staple uninjuicd

From Mr. G. Senior, n Machinist of New Orleans.
Dr. A. Jones?Dear Sir, in answer tc your inquiry
of uiy opinion of your Patent Cotton Gin, I
beg leave to state, that 1 was fifteen years engaged
iti the cotton factories of Manchester, England,
and during four years of that tin e, 1 was
foreman in the house of Messrs. Lewis, Williams
A: Co., and near five years spinner in the house of
Messrs. Saudford ?SL Greene. I have teen vcur
Cotton Gin in operation, and have examined the
cotton ginned by it, and pronounce it better cleansed,
and the staple less injured, than ar.y cclt< u
that ever came under my observation. It is completely
ready for the breaker without the nid of the
blower, and would, therefore, save the first process
in manufacturing tfie article. 1 consider cotton
cleansed by your Gin, would command from cr.c
to two cents on the pound n.otc than the average
crops brought into the Manchester maiket, end
cleansed by common Gins. Yr vis, very tesp'ly.
