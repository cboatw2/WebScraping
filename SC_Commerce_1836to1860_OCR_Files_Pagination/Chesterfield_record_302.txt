Clinton, Miss. Sept. 9 h, lflJW. i
J. S. Skinner, Esq.?Dear Sir?The ,
prospect of co ton lets changed very much
siacethe Is: August, for that lime we have
had no rain at all; and with the dry weather
came myriads of worms on the cotton, and
destroyed it very much. How they are
produced uq ojie knows. They attack tlie
forms first, then the blooms, then the young
bolls, and even eat those that are full size
before opening. If they make the slightest
puncture it dies. I. noticed several eaten
out entirely, but this is not common, as they
seem to take a distaste as soon as it bebecomes
acrkl from fermentation. They
vary in.length from an eighth to one, inch,
nre of uniform size in the girth, except the
head and tail. . Their hoods are a little flittened
nnd turned downward, with a fang
ou each side of the mouth. The tail is ra?
ther more pointed than the generality of
worms, aipf is quite transparent to the end
from where it begins to taper. They have
a row of|-gs on each side, which are very
proportionate in size to their general structure
; vol are little longer towards the head
end tail than in the centre. Their feet are
black. They hav^ 3 ftiw black spots estending
from *the hea l to the tail, in rows
which are on the concentric rings arourd
the b??dy a pale yellow indented streak running
the full length. They seem to prefer
the rare atmosphere of the highlands to the
more dense sections of Mississippi and Ya.
zoo, or even that of our creek bottoms.
They seem worse in those place* where
the louse prevailed last spring, i am thus
particular in order to let you know, as fur
I am able to inform you, the kind of insect
they n re.
Altliough worms are considered the low.
est in the scale of animal beings, yet they
are capable of doing great injury ; and in
order to give you an idea of tho extent, I
will cite you two examples : Owe planter
who has in 280 acres, has propoposud to
pick it ou% gin, dec., and let any one have
tne Wuole crop for 100 bales insured. This
plontation is one of the richest, and the
crop was at one time considered among
-l - ? --J Km!
tnc uesii uiiu t: uu ciiauuinjr ui n?c nun
occured, would have turned out a bale to
the acre. Another gentleman proposed his
whole crop of 350 acres ( hat he might hire
out his hands) to any one who would give
him 70 bales, lie is an old and experienced
planter, and has very good land.
Some crops of corn are gathered in fine
order. Wc are rr.ising very fine and heavy
wheat in the northern part of tho State.
Not many planters will purchase meat this
coming season. Upper country produce
will never be again n such universal demand.
So you may readily discover the
salutary lesson necessity has taught us.
Now if we were but free of debt, and would
engage in a direct trade with any portion
of the world our interest might dictate to
us, we would not be burnt by the fires of the
Upper country and New York. Those
who hold the tight reins over us. would then
com?> to us, instead of our going to them
as now, for our own means by which foreign
importations are introduced among,
us, and at a very heavy per cent, advance.
If co'toji brings a higher price in Liverpool
and Huvre by stopp ng at New Orleans
and N,,vv-York. (and particularly the latter,)
to make a profit to others than the growers,
and if gooas am made cheaper by sloping
at many plates before they reach here, for
Drofitsto be made by adding on heavy p^r
cen's, there must be tome legerdemain
about ihe operations beyond my ken.?I
am not against the not them capitalist making
os much as he can?I am not against
any place or people?but I do not think
any one ought to be allowed to speculate
on the cotton wc make, for the manufacturers
ought to have it direct from us, and we
their goods direct from them, no metier tn
particular where they aro established. I
know it is a hard matter to divert the course
of trade from a channel it Ims been running
in for any length of time?but depend on
it, we aro losing every year millions that
might be saved to the south if shu would
but transact her own business. Very respectfully,
your friend and obodh. serv't.

on the selection of male animals in
breeding cattle and sheep.
In tho May number of tl?e London Far.
mer's Magazine, ifi a valuable papcron this
subject by Earl Spencer, who is one of the
most successful breed rs in England, and
whose sheep, produced by a cross of the j
New Leicester and the Merino, have attrac. |
ted so much notice, both on account of
weight and wool and extreme bcuu?y of
form, at the Smithfield Fairs. Earl Spon'
cor controverts the idea advanced by Air.
Cline, the celebrated surgeon, th it the male
should be smaller than tho female. Earl
S. is of the opinion, that in crossing differ*
??nt in uH>ir>li nnp urnc nitiph InffTfT
w ... - ?vr..? O
than the other, tho male should always be
sclecled from the smallest; but that in the
same brmJ the male shout 1 be, as na ure
has provided, the largest animal. In our
apprehension, there is a good reason why
in crossing different breeds, '.he female
should be selected with a roomy ches', and
the male of a sm;ill* r size, as we have known
within a few years several instances fatal to
calves and to cows, in which a large bull
of the Durham or short horn breed, had
been put to oows of tho common breeds of 1
q small size. In these cases, calving was j
impossible from the size of the young, and l
d-ath to parent and young was the result '
The following is tho directions given for I
selecting a buH or a ram, the particular i
. qualities desired in crossing or propagating <
tho breed having been determined before* t
band, and the kinds to be crossed chosen s
with reference to that point. /
Gun. Farmer. 1
4 The first object which any breeder of c
catt'.o or sheep must keep in view, whether f
lie intends to breed bulls or rams, or whether s
hiaahn it mc?ily*1o .breed oxen or wethers, d
is that the stock he breeds from shall be s
healthv. The first thing, therefore, in the c
???^p??? ?
f lection of a male, is the indication of a
good consitution. In all animals, a wide
chest indicates strength of constitution* and
there can be no douht that tins is the point
of hape most material for a breeder to look
at in the selection of either a bull or a ram.
In order to ascertain that the chest of these
animals is the wide, it is not sufficient to
observe that they have wide bosoms, but
the width that is perceived in looking at
them in the front, should be Continued along
the brisket, which ought to show great fullness
in the part which is just under the el.
bows ; it is also necessary that they should
bo what is called thick through the heart.
Another indication of a good constitution
is, that a male animal should have n masculine
appearance. Willi this view, a certain
degree of coarseness is by no means
objectionable, but this coarseness shouKJ not
be such as would behkely to show itself in
a castrated animal, because it might thus
happen that the oxen or w?th*rs produced
from such a sire, would be coarse ?l?of
which in them woulJ be a fault. Another
point to be attended to, not merely as an
indication of a good cons;:tution, but as a
merit of itself,is that au animal should exhibit
greai muscular power, or rather th >t his
muscles should be large. Tnis is an usual
accompaniment ofstrength and constitution,
but it a!so shows that there w 11 be a good
proportionate mixture of lean and fat :n ths
meat produced from the animal ; the muscles
being thnt part which in meat is lean.
A thick neck in both bulls and rams is a
proof of the muscles being large, and there
can hardly be a greater fault in the shape of
a male animal of either sort, than his having
a thin neck. I am inclined to say, thai
in the New Leicester breed of sheep, which
is the breed to which I am accustomed, a
ram's neck cannot be too thick.?Oilier
indications of musde in sheep are more
difficul* to observe than in cattle. In a bull,
there ought to be a full muscle on bo h si l< s
of the backbone, just behind the top of the
shoulder blades; he ought also to h ive the
muscles on the ou'side ofthe thigh full, and
extending down nearly to the hough. L
will seldom happen that a bull having 'hese
indications will be deficient in muscle-"
Wm. Garbutt,esq. of Wheatland, N. Y.
in a communication to the Genesee Farmer,
dated 19th July, announces the arrival of a
bull and two heifers, impo ted by Mr. Vernon,
from the stock of Mr. Duvy, one o
the most celebrated breeders of the pure
I North Dcvons in Devonshire, England, and
I say9 :
- I I M
| 44 i he animals are very Dcautilui ana sumI
ciently forge for profit, and a valuable ac.
qubition to Western N. York, for which
we aro indebted to Mr. Vernon. I con.
aider the Devons better adapted to the wants
and habits of the fanners in Western New
York, than any other of the improved
stock, not excepting the improved Short,
horned Durhatns. The want of size in
the Devons is more the fault of the breeders
than the breed, for animals soon adaptlhomselves
to the quuli'y nnd quantity of food
they have to l.ve on. Tiiey aro excellent
feeders, and the beef is of the best quality,
being well mixed. They nre fair milkers,
and yield a great proportion of butter and
cheese to the quantity of m Ik?they are
very active, tough and hardy?excellent
travellers, and first best for labor. Bui
permit me here to add, that we farmers
must learn to take better care of our animals
before we can receive much benefit
from improved stork. If we canno' supthem
with a sufficiency of nu'rilive food, and
shelter them from the inclemency of iho
weather, it is of very lit le consequence
what the breed may bo?th?y aro all unprofitable.
* * * * The most effi.
cient moans of improving our domestic
animals would be the in'roduction of agricultural
exhibitions?by comparing each
o: Iter's stock, wo should become competent
judges, see their defects, find the means ol
correcting them, and receive a powerful
stimulant to improvement."

I took quite a fancy to a large three year
old heifer, the name of which I do not re.
collect. But Out hams as I have before
hinted, I do not think the proper stock on
light soils, cither at the North or South.
There are exceptions, but as a grand rule,
they must have a luxuriant pasture that produces
a good thick bite in summer, with
generous feed throughout the winter; or it
is idle to think that they can bo kept up to
good flesh and great size. I believe Mr.
B. for one, is becoming convinced of this,
and has accordingly procured some Devona.

soon to arrive from abroad, and also a few
good native cows. One of these hist of
handsome color, limb and shape, unites extraordinary
milking qualities. From the

their expense from abroad. In this way,
the Ayrtshircs have been made, that have
become second, now only, to the Durhamg. 1
Could the attention of stock breeders be
better employed than turning to this suhject? 1
It really seems to me the only way that our
country can ever be filled up with good
milking and fattening animals. A few
years of such breeding, would assuredly do
more for us than a century of importations."
Fine Barbs.
The following description of two fine
Barbs we take from a letter in the New
York Spirit of the Times, dated St. Mary's,
Onio, Sept. 14.
I had seen Capt. Riley's notice of these
horses in the Spirt of last October, and
recollected reading it, and comparing the
horses in my mijirt with Ciay's Stumbotil,
nn I the two horses brought by the same
gentleman to Gen. Jackson in 1833, but
never until accident threw me in the way of
them and their present as worth more to
breed from than native stock. But, Mr.
Spirit, 1 feei so fully convinced that these
horses are the fountain mire nf tl?> knrKQ*i.

Southern climate to bring up. and impart
to our small horses more bone, solidity, and
strength, that I believe it a duty as a patron
of the turf, to call the attention of some of
the knowing ones, and suggest the propri.
eiy of ascertaining by ov-ans of such m ires
as Black Maria, Randolph\ dam. Angora,
and others that could be detailed from many
of the stables of Virginia, Kentucky, or
Alabama, whether one or both of 'hem

an intention of practising what I advise,
by scndiug one mare to each next year,
if I can procure those which have bred
winners at a price within the size of my
pile. Maiyoube, a barb, or half barb, is
the most powerful, active and quick motioned
horse [ ev< r saw, and 1 am familiar with
the western iurf and stallions, for the last
twenty years,?the Eclipse, Archy, H^nry,
and Timoleon stock, as well as the Leviathan,
Luzborough and Margrave; but in saying
thus much, I wis!) to detract from none,
nor speuk in terms of more deserved commendation.
1 have bought, sold, trained, j
and run horses of all s z-s, shapes, colors,
and d'mensious, and been a regular attendant
at the course whenever in my power,
but never bred them. Yet I consider this
horse unique, and as is well observed by
his own- r, unable to be matched, until he
shall produce his own likeness. I have
measured him carefully, and find him so
different, that I send you a part of lh? results
as a curiosity, and intend to preserve
a copy for fu'uro observations and comparisons.

PATENT BUTCHERING.
James Carson, M. I)., of Liverpool, has
taken ? ut a paten' for what he calls a "New
quick, easy, and humane method of Slaughtering
animals." The advantages of his
method (of the mode of performing which
his paper gives no description) as stated
by himself are the following :
"An increase of the edible parts of a
carcase to the amount of at least one-tenth
beyond that which it would supply, by any
mode ofslaughtering hitherto in use. The
meat thus obtained is more juicy, tender,
and far better flavored, ft sets sooner, and
of course is earlier fii for use. It keeps
much loneer sweet and untainted. In some
CT
experiments made on meat killed in my
mode, and some slaughtered in the usual
way, at the same time and kept in the same
place and circumstances, mine continued
sweet, while the other gave the most une.
quivocu! signs of incipient putrefaction. I<
never shrinks, bu' on the contrary enlarges
in cooking ; the fa: being supplied with the
juices which enrich the muscular or red
portion is much more savory and is more
acceptable to delicate palates, and is there,
fore the less wasteJ. It requires less time
to cook The centre of a large joint is
done nearly as soon ns the surface. These
qualities are derived from the meat being
less spongy, and a better conductor of heat,
than meat obtained by any of the mode of
sluaghtering at present in use. It preseives
well, and requires a much less quantity of
salt."
If Mr. Carson has discovered a mode of
slaughtering animals which will realize one.
fourth of the advantages he claims, he has
made a discovery of great value, and we
shall hope to hear of the speedy introduction
of the patent mode of butchering into the
United States.?Genesee Farmer.
INFLUENCE OF CLIMATE UPON SEED.
We received, la t spring,tw 've ears of
Dulton coin fiom Me 0>born, from Oswegocounty,
his residence differing from ours
in latitude and altitude, about two degrees. 1
We planted with this seed about eight rows
across our field, the residue being planted i
with seed ef our own raising. The Oswe- I
50 corn tasselled about two weeks earlier <
than that form seed raised in Albany, thus bi
showing six or seven day's difference for a tf
computed degree of l-t i ude in the earliness w
of the crop?the northern seed g ving the o!
earliest crop in a ratio inverse to the for* fc
wariness of the spring. This will serve as
a hint to farmers in districts whore corn is
liable to be cut off by early autumnal frosts, (
to obtain their seed from a more northern
latitude, or from a dis'rict of higher latitude. 01

STRIPPING OFF THE LEAVES OP MULTICAULI9. C
G. B. Smith Esq. ?
Harrishurgh, September 15, 1839. )
Dear Sir,?At the instance of several of
my friends, who are, as well as m>self en- *
gaged in the rearing of multicaul s trees, 1 c
take the liberty of addressing you for the
purpose of eliciting information on a ques- r
tion which we deem of some importance.
A Mr. lias a large lot of morus 1
multicaulis trees, growing in our neighbour- 1
hood, and is now stripping them of all their '
foliage, excepting a few leaves on the ex- '
treme ends of the branches?his reason, is,
that ' the buds will not be so liable to i jury
from frost, and that they will mature more |
readily and sooner, than if the leaves were
permitted to remain on.'
Mr. ', also, has a large quantity
of trees growing in a lot adjoining Mr.
's. On being questioned * why he
did not strip his trees,' his reply was, * that
he followed that plan last year, but thought
that it injured the buds.*
Presuming on youi long experience in
the cultivation of the tree, 1 feel confident
that you are fully capable of satisfying us
by giving the desired information?whether
in your opinion that by permitting the fol- ,
rago to romaiaon the trees, subject to attacks
from frosts, thereby causing (Tie stem
or* petiole' to become shfFand hard, consequently
injurious, if not to:ally, destroy*
ing the bud ? or if it would be better to strip
the foliage off? ? ?.
ANSWKK.
Baltimore, September, 17, 1839.
Dear Sir.,?In answ/r to your letter of
the 15th, I would remark, that I am opposed
to stripping the leaves from the muliieaulis
in the fall. The leaves are as necessary to
tite perfection of the buds and ripening of
Ibe wood, as iliu roots are, and I should as
soon think of digging under the tree and
cutting off the roots, as of taking off the
leaves. If the leaves are stripped off, the
buds ure almost certuin to start to supply
their places ; especially if we have a warm
spell of weather,?and thus the buds are
very much iujured for planting next season.
The functions of the loaf nri as necessary
to the ma urity of ihe bu I as the tree itself
is, and without this aid, I do not believe
they can become perfect. As to any injurious
effect to be apprehend-d from the pe- f
lole (or stem of tho l?*af) 4 becoming hard
from fros1, and consequen'ly injurious to, if
not to ally destroying the bud,' a little re. ,
flection will show the fallacy of the supposi*
tion. The very first effectual frost will turn
the leaves yellow, and b? fore twelve o'clock i
of the day after each frost, every leaf will i
have fallen to the ground. No hard stern j
or petiole will be left. The bud will he per- I
feci; ahd after the leaf falls of its own maturity,
the bu?/s never start till next year. <
But if you lake them off, before they have t
p- rformed their functions, the tree naturally t
tries to supply the deficiency by sending out I
new ones in their places, and thus the bud <
intended for next year's growth of wood, is <
made to form a leaf this year, and by this j
extra exertion the eye is more or less injur- i
ed. L t it be borne in mind, tiiat a tree |
cannot grow without leaves. They are the <
the lungs of plants ; through thom the plant <
breathes, and by means of the oxygen they t
extract from the atmosphere, the plant is f
matured. The leaves are merely attached <
to the tree by a temporary fixture, and held s
to it so long only as it of use. The moment t
the tree ceases to have use for it, it lets go s
its hold and falls to the ground. Thecir- a
culatmg fluid, or the snp of the tree, returns ii
to the roots, or at least cesses to flow, as ?
soon as ttie tree is matured, or ihe cold p
vvea'herput a sop to vegetation; and as u
soon as this takes place, ttie leaves fall from tl
ihe trees. The only reason any one can w
give for stripping offiho leaves prematurely, o
is that they, (the leaves,) keep up the cir- tl
culation of sap by the force of suction long p
er than is useful to the plant. This seems tl
to me u most unnatural supposition , the
leaves are not the cause, but die effect of 01
the circulation of the sap, as is proved by ui
ihe fact that If you strip a multicaulis of all gi
its leaves in summer, it immediately puis y<
out new ones, which it could not do if the in
circulation of the snp was suspended. at
But I do not depend upon mere theory, m
year before last I wished to preserve some
leaves for use iu spring, and in October I m
ttrippod a few trees for the purpose. Every e<;
u I immediately began to grow, and when
ie frost s^t in and stopt vegetation, the trees
ere covered with young leaves of the size
f a dollar, and there was not a bud formed
>r the next season's growth. Respectfully,
Gideon B. Smith.
chinese mode of propagating trees.
According to Havison's account of Chicse
horticulture, the nurserymen of the ce.
stial empire have a mode of propagating
<*?s, which promises some advantage over
!lo;h> rs. A brancn of good growth, and
ne that will not disfigure or injure the tree,
selected for operating upon. Around
lis branch, at the place in'ended for sepaition,
a snail rope made of twisted hay or
raw filled with cow dung is wound repeat.
Ily around the branch until quite a mass
f the material is accumulated. Above this
hung a gourd or other vessel, punctured
i such a manner that but a drop nt a lime
scapes and falls on the mass; and the frouency
of the fall is graduated so that the
tass shall bo constantly moist. An incis.
in is then made, and the bark removed
om a narrow space three.fourths of the
ircumference of the branch, immediately
"low the rope. After remaining about a
lon.h, one-half of tho remaining bark is
moved, the mass boi..g kept wet as before,
n another month, and sometimes earlier,
ie roots will show themselves at the outide
of ihe muss, and the whole be filled
nth their ramifications. The branch is
iow carefully separated from iho tree, and
Janted in the position it is to occupy ; great
Mention being given that the rope, now
early or quite rotted, is not in the least dinurbed
in the process of removal. The
lenefits of this ays'era, are, that trees of n
uvorite kind may be multiplied, where
here are none suitable for grafting or inno:ulation
; and that trees so grown will proluce
abundance of fruit in three cr four
rears from Hie time of removal.
The Chinese select a place where the
> ranch is enlarged, or the commencement
>f a year's growth, for winding the rope, it
>eing found that roots spring at such points
nore quickly than at others. Alt< r the
)ranch is sep a.aled, the stuinp from which
t is taken is cut off to some proper place.

A VISIT TO THE BURNING MINE NEAR POTTS.
VIL&E, PA.
A large party of gentlemen assembled
At Minersville a few days since, for the purpose
of visiting the burning mine, on the
jugular vein, at the gap of the Broad Mourn
ain.
Bonding above us foi some hundred feet,
md belching forth smoke and flime, arose
he track of the vein, which we ascended on
he crop. A little puffing and blowing
brought us to the second level, where the
disaster commenced during the extreme
:old weather of last winter. A hanging
grate placed at its mouth to equalize the
emperaiure, communicated fire to thecou.
plings of the gangway, and was the primary
;ause of the vast damage which has accrued.
Some hundred feet farther up the hiil,
i large space had caved in, and down the
issures between the upper and lower n eks,
:ould be seen a yawning fiery gulph. A
ulphurous exhalation issued from it. About
he jaws of this vast cave, were deposite of
ulphur, and some alkulino substances, in
;reat quaoities. Large rents and fissures
n the ground showed the extent of the ra.
[ing internal heat, and many places ap
eared ready to full in, arid precipitate the
icauiious spectator into the chasm. Down
le old air shafts, the currents of air rushed
dth a rumbling sound, to feed with their (
xygen the volcano beneath. Now and
ion a crumbling mass of slate, or a detached
ortion of'rock, would plunge headlong into
le smoky crater!
Tue vegetation on the summit and sides
f the hill, showed the scatching effects of
nnatural heat; the tall pine dropped its
iunt arms, the hemlock bowed its head, the
oung oak and chestnut were clad in a prelature
11 sear and yello.v leaf,'* and here
id there, the mountain vines seem to cling
ore closely to their parent trees.
A dreary, spot, is now that once lovely
ountuin gup! the voice of industry is hush*
!
When, or in what manner, the ravag
will be stopped, is a matter of uncertainty'
(n the mean time, the loss of time and materia
la fills heavy on Mr. L. C. Dougherty,
the leasee, who has used every possible
! means within his power to check the de.
jstructioo. Attempts have been made to
smother tho flame, but it always breaks out
in some new place with increased fury; and
baffles its opponents. Pottsville Jour.
THB DISPUTED TERRITORY.
Governor Fairfield, of Maine, has ad.
dressed n letter to the Land Agent of that
State, Tul'us Mclntyre, Esq., apprizing hina
that \ery extensive preparations are being
made by a set of lawless men in the province
of New Brunswick for the cutting of timber
the approaching season on what is colled
the disputed territory, and requesting him to
give notice to said persons, and to all others,
that no exertions of the Executive of
Maine will be remitted to breakup this atrocious
system of plundering, and to bring
tho9e engaged in it, and their abettors, to
condign punishment. He thinks a lenient ^
course has been pursued long enough. His
Excellency adds:
44 Information has also been received that
a latere number of* permits,* as they are
O " w ? - 9 w _
called, have been solJ and issued by the
land agent of Massachusetts to the citizens
of New Brunswick and others to cut timixr
on lands claimed by that Commonwealth,
lying within the disputed territory, and bordering
on both sides of the Aroostook river,
notwithstanding the earnest but respectful
remonstrances of the Executive of this
State. And it is represented by those in
th immediate command on the Aroos ook
that it w ill he impossible for them to execute
the severul resolves of the Legislature providing
for the prevention of trespassers, if
Massachusetts persists in granting these permits,
thereby openings door foradmiaiios
into the tern ory of foreigners, without^wnt,
to surround and render n ff ctual t'.e efforts
of the small force which this Stale is compelled
to keep ttv-re to save our noble forests
irom entire des'ru lion ; and inasmuch ns
many of these permits, it is said,wijf probably
be obtained as a mere legal pretence
and cover for the most extensive depredations,
I trust that, under ihese Arcums'unct.-s,
the utmost rightful power will be oxerted
on your part to prevent any lumbering
Ojtcratious upon the disputed ten itory for
the present, under any pretence of authority
whatever- Should the authority prove insufficient,
the power of the S.ate, in its legislative
capacity, may soon be brought o
bear upon the subject by a "eg imate exercise
of the sovereignly of the State over its
public streams.
** You had better, therefore, forewarn
those who have obtained these permits.
that, even if they should oe successiut ut
their opera'ions of cutting, it is not improbable
tha the timber would be rendeied entirely
unavailable to teem from the coor.se
, which tne State would find it necessary to
take ft r the maintenance of its rights and
I the prese rvation of its inter s:s. it is sin.
cert jy to be hoped therefore, that, if none
[ of tne high considerations which the case
I presents to the authorities of Massachusetts
. are sufficient to prevent the issuing of those
! p rimis, no citizen of Maine, at least, will
, attempt to exercise any supposed rights utiw
der them, when it woul 1 manifestly prove
, so pernicious to the best interests of tho
I State, and especially at so important a crisis
t as the present may fairly be considered in
regard 10 the great question of boundary.
' * Very respectfully, your ofr-dient servant,
JOHN FAILFELD, Governor."
, Agreeably to the Governor's suggestion,
, public notice has been given by Mr. Mcln.
tyre, cautioning ull p rsons against cutting
timber on the d sputed terriory, whether
with or without permits from the land agent
of Massachusetts f Journal of Commerce.

l From the VVestfiold (Mass.) Spectator,
i Great Explosion.?-Three Powder
Mills blown up ; one Dwelling-house, one
Barn, and two oat buildings blown to aims;
and, strange to say, no lives lost.?On Mon. ^
I day morning last, at about holf past ten
o'clock, the powder mills belonging to Messrs.
F? o & Gillwit, standi g about two miles 0
west of this village, were blown up. There
were three explosions, at intervals of twenty
or thirty seconds. The first was the cylin*
der mill, which was n short time before pu:
in operation, and the workmen had left but
ubout five minutes previous, and who were
at tho time working in tho corning null,
about five rods distant, and which blew up
wiihin twenty seconds, giving the men bare,
iy time to leave the in II, and throw themselves
into the brush within twenty feet of it.
And, strange as it may appear, they escaped
slightly injured?one without a mark of
injury, except from being blackened by the
po\vd* r ; the other receiving a billet of wood
in his breast. They had scarcely risen
from their hiding place, when the packinghouse,
which contained four or five hundred
barrels of powder, exploded, prostrating

mark (he spot on which it stood. The
ground for several feet around was swept
clean of every thing. A dwelling-house
standing near it was unroofed, two sides
were blown in, and not even a joist left standing.
The plastering of the standing walls
was shaken from them; the partitions broken
to pieces, feather beds were44 shook up,"
and not a person of tne six or seven in the
house injured.
The conclusion was so great that buildings
in the village received considerable injury
from it. One building, at least a milo
and a half from the mills, had twenty or
thirty lights broken our, and another hud
one window totally demolished, the casing
being carried across the room. Abont ten
thousand pounds of powder, ready for sale,
I and nearly the same quantity manufacturing,
were burnt.
