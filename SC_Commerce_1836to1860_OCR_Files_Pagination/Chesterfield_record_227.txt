The Professors of the Medical College
of South Carolina iu Charleston having all
resigned, aud the exercises of the College
have been discontinued. There were two
Medical Colleges in the city. This was the

i
7ears, a difficulty arose between the Pro.
lessors aud the medical society of Charleston,
who owned the Institution, in consequence
of which the Professors resigned and
set in operation a new Medical College,
called the ''Medicnl College of the State of
South Carolina." This latter institution is
still continued and flourishes.

Mr. Clay in North Carolina.?The Ralcigh
Register states that a free and unreserved
interchange of views with the Whig

satisfied him that they would warmly espouse
the cause of Henry Clay as a candidate
for the Presidency. Ons subject "the
spy in Washington," one of fhe corrcspon*
dents of the New York Courier and En-!
quirer, writes as follows :
Washington, Jan. Teh, 1939; }
1 On ihe evening of the SO li of December.
I I unde, stand, an informal communication
| between the Whigjmcmbers of the iegislai
ture of North Carolina was held at Raleigh.
| Among other subjects, the quas'ion ef a
candidate for the Presidency came under
I consideration. It*was the desire of th S:
in attendance to compare opinions on that
j point, and to ascertain, as tar ns practica;
ble, not only their own sentiments rospecI
ively, but the probable feeling and wishes
of their constituents. Great enthusiasm,
witli entire confidence of success, pervaded
the meeting ; and the result was an almost
unanimous expression that Henry Clay, of
It- 1-- V ., '
j rvriiiucKj, was me man ui uir jiuujmc,
| the State of North Carolina. The meeting
adjourned after this interchange of opinion,
with a thorough conviction, that Mr. Clay
I ought to, and would be supported by that
i State for the office of President.

\ Congress-?Little of any importance is (
doing in either Bouse. In tho Senate a
motion by Mr. Rives to poslpone indifinitely
the bill to graduate the pric'C of tho Pub- j
he Lands was los', 23 to 27.
The resolutions of the Legislature of'
North Carolina on the subject of National
politics have been presented by Mr. Brown,
who expressed a determination not to regard
them, because they "tacitly," denied
the doctrine of instruction ! Mr. Strange ,
also expressed his purpose of conforming
to the resolutions so far as he conscencious- ,
!y could ; but there wer? some things re|
quired by them which ever the tortures of i
martyrdum would not compel him to do. j
In the House, a motion to amend a bill j
to regulate rations in the navy so as to allow
six cents daily instead of a gill of spirits j
now allowed, prevailed. Among the numerous
resolu'ions of inquiry adopted were
the following.
. I- a* m / t.? . 1 I
un motion ot air. v>iuy, 01 ixemucwy, ;
Resolved, That the Secretary of the J
! Treasury be directed 10 report to the Sen!
ate t c proportion of the nctt proceeds of {
the public lands which each State would
I have received up to and including the 1st of
January, 1S39, under the "Bill entitled an
act to appropriate for a limited time the process
of the sales of the public lands of the
United States, nnd for granting lands to
certain States," which passed both Houses
of Congress, and would have become a law
if it had received the approbation of the ,
President.
Mr. Bobbins submitted the following for i
consideration.
Resolved, That a committee be appointed,
consisting of five members of the Senate,
jointly with such committee as may he appointed
on the part of the House of Rcprescntatives,
to consider the expediency ofpro- ,
viding mi ins i ulionrf learning, to be estab.
lislicd in the city of VVasington, for the np- ,
plication o*'/he legacy bequeathed by Mr.
James Smithson of London, fo the U. S. in
trust for that purpose ; also, to consider the
pvwwlipnrv fS n r?hnr!r?r fnrQimh institution.
J w. ?
together with the powers and privileges
which in ihe'r opinion the said char:er \
ought to confer; also, to consider the ex. >
ped cncy of ways and means to be provi.
ded by Congress other than the said legacy,
but in addition thereto, and in aid of said .
benevolent intention, and to report on the
premises.
Mr. R. addressed the Senate at some
length in explanation of his views on the
subject of the resolution ; and, after a few '
remarks from Mr. Preston, highly complimentary
of tho venerable mover, the reso. (
lutiort was agreed to.
Mr. Sherrod Williams ofTered resolutions
that the House proceed to the despatch of ,
the business of the people, and that, if it is
intended to remain only to make speeches j
and not to do the business of the people, '
Congress ought hencefortr. to adjourn and '
let the people elect members who will work
more and ta k less.
Mr. Adams objected fo consider the
resolutions as being disrespectful to the
House. The question of consideration
was decided in tbc negative 67 to 03.
Washinghon, Jan. 9,1839.
UNITED STATES SENATE.
A re nimportant but exciting debate sprung
up to-day upon a motion to print certain
resolutions adopted by the Legislatute of
Vermont, touching the subject of slavery
and the abolition of Slavery. Mr. Prentiss,
of Vermont, presented the resolutions.
They embodied sentiments ttrongly hostile
to the system of slavery, and favorable to
the aboltion of slavery in the District of Columbia.
Mr. Prentiss,f in presenting them, made
the customary motion to print.
Mr. Foster, of Tenn objected.
Mr. Calhoun spoke in a very excited
manner in regard to the resolutions from
Vermont* He was not only opposed to
prnting but considered the resulutions as
dangerous and destructive to the union of
ihe Slates. The course of the Abolitionists
he considered destructive of the best inter,
ests of the States, and if persisted in, would
forthwith lead to the dissolution of the Union.
Mr. Kins, of Ala., snoke in a mnnner
siiii more excited, and said if the matter em- 1
bodied in the resolutions was discussed and 1
considered, he and his friends would forthwi
h leave the Hall, and the Union would
be disolved.
Mr. Lumpkin, of Geo., was surprised
that the motion to print should be persisted
in, and moved that the motion to print be
laid on the table.
Mr. Prentiss said that he asked for prin.
ting as an act of courtesy to the Slate ttiat
he represented, and he was surprised that
the motion should be objected to.
The yeas and nays were demanded, and
the motion to print was rejeeted?ayes 27,
noes 9.
The Senate proceeded to the order of
the day, after tho consideration of some

The Drought ?The drought of the sum.

convenience in the central portions of the
State, as well as in the lake country. The

menced, ore now almost entirely convened
into ice. The oldest settlers in the State
never witnessed such scarcity of water. All
mills, except on the largest and most duraihle
streams, are stopped, and the Mount
Vermon Watchman says that people come
BO or 70 miles to Owl crefk for grinding ;
and tha* large stream only affords water
to curry a run of stones at each mill. We

Total Loss of an Iron Steam-vessel?
By accounts from Hamburg of the 29th
October, we learn that the new iron steamboat
the Eagle, lately built in this country,
and destined to ply on the Elbe, between
Hamburg and Dresden, went down in a violent
storm on the night of the 26th October,
near Amelank. The crew were saved in

The vessel had only left Yarmouth the preceeding

them is a steamsr of nearly 600 tons. The
