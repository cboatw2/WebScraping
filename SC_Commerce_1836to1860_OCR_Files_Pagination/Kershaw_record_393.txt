THE GOVERNOR'S ELECTION.
We have attentively read the articles
that have lately appeared in the Courier
on the Covcr.ior,s election, which seems
to aitr i t a very general and just interest.
Professing to know no more of the merits i
of ilia question thaii these disclose on;
their face, or leave to be implied from the j
ambiguous terms in which the authors
choose at times to insinuate their meaning,
we have found it impossible to escape
certain conclusions that have, doubtless,
forced themselves on other minds, as little
biassed by irterest or prejudice, as ours.
...1...
rcrsonaiiy we are iimiueieui. mm to ???...
Governor. We have no preference al all
between the candidates named, as men;
and believe they have all ample capacity
lor the high station they seek, but we are
not equally satisfied with the reasons on
which thejr respective nominations are
placed. The public aspect of the question is
not alone of any importance to the people,
however deeply its private merits may)
influence the feelings and conduct of the
parties themselves or their friends. The
office of Governor of this State, though
not of great executive power, is of eminent
dignity and influence, and more
wenerallv taken out of the State as an in
r?
dex of its politics than any other. The
people, therefore, whuaarc only concerned
for the proper administration of their
public affairs, will perplex *heir minds
with no question of privute favoritism or
personal ambition, but steadily look to the
manner in which the public dignity, peace
and happiness is to be affected by this
election.
We do not mean to institute any comparison
between the rclulivc cluims of the
candidates at this time, but simply state
for public consideration, a few deductions
of fact, developed by the discussion, as fir
it has advanced in the Courier, to which
two of the parties appear from choice
to confine their communications. And
though we acknowledge we are of fallible
minds and as susceptible of prejudice as
others, we feel assured of having set down
nothing here that is not fully sustained by
the letter and spirit of what has been
written. If our observations appear tinjust
to any, perhaps the parlies injured
may, on reflection, discover an ekplanation
of their offence in the fact, that
while they have been blinded by the heat
and dust of an exciting canvass, we have
enjoyed the more advantageous position
nfa mere looker-on, concerned only that,
in this strife of rebsllious passions, the
.Republic receives no harm.
* Several things have struck our observation
in the discussion on the Governor's
Election in the Charleston Courier.
1st. We have observed that, while the
?innnixtA ^jCol. Richardson charge,
without proof indeed, but with strong a"p-~
parent conviction, that his nomination
originated with a clique, they think it unnecessary
to explain how their favorites
wer*' brought out, whether by a clique or
by themselves. We confess that between
the taro, we prefer the first as the more
? respectable and more fair mode of nomination.
Both Judge Johnson and Col.
Hammond were named by anonymous
writers: Col. Richardson by almost every
public journal of the State, with the concurrence
and by authority o( a number of 1
its most iufiuental men, of all parties and 1
sections. At least it was so declared at 1
the time, and we presume no candid per- 1
son is disposed to doubt the fact. '
2d. We have observed that Col. Rich- 1
ardson's nomination is theonly one which '
professes to be founded on considerations
of a public character. All the arguments '
presented in support of the others, really ;
appear to us summable into this one?that '
the election of the candidate would grati- '
fy, excedingly, him and his particular '
friends. But what benefit is to redound
to the people of SouthCarolina, from the (
election of either of them, we do not find '
suggested by any of the correspondents ot
the Courier. (
3d. We have observed that Judge Johnson's
claims rest upon his*personal amiability
and long judicial services?Col.
Hammond's, on his having served in the
militia, and made an anti-abolition speech
?Col. Richardson's, on his alleged wisdom
of character, his active public services
in the Legislature and Congress,
his inhabiting an important region of the
State, which has been heretofore allowed
to give fewer officers to its administration
than any other, and on the reconciliation
of parties, it is thought, his election will
produce.
4th* We have observed that all, who
are in favor of an United States Bank and ,
repudiate the sub-treasury, oppose Col.
Richardson, and go for one or the other
of his competitors.
5th. We have observed that those who
attack Colonet Kiciiakdson, wun mosij
vehemence, invariably accompany it willi j
acrimonious assaults on Mr, Calhoun,
ami on Martin Van ?cren and his ail-'
ministration, and appear to favor the election
of Gen. Harrison, to the Presidency.
* 6th. We have observed that while
Judge Johnson is well known to favor
the establishment of an United -Slates
Bunk, to have no faith in the sub-treasury,
and to have formerly approved the course
of Col. Preston, in Congress, as proved
by his presiding at his sub-treasury dinner,
and that in all these Col. Richardson
stands diametrically opposed to him?Col.
Hammond, has not, until the eleventh
hour, committed himself, but may and will
be voted for by u cn of both opinions and
all sides.
7th. We have observed, that, for the
success of both Judge Johnson and Col.
Hammond, main reliance is placed on ex-[
citing to the highest pitch, by irritating |
I reminiscences of the past, the passions of
the two-old parties of the state, while the
election of Col. Richardson will be a
healing of wounds, and rests its strength
on the calm good sense, magnanimity, and
patiiotism of the people; appealing to no
vulgar prejudice nor contracted views of
.public interest.
8th. We have observed that Col. Richardson,
its long known and consistent
supporter, is the avowed candidate of the
present State Rights Democratic Party,
or the Administration Party of this Statehe
gets no support from any opposed to
it?and we have also observed that while
some original friends, and other eleventh
hour converts to the administration are I
i rr I
for Judge Johnson or uoi. uammunu,
thai all who are of the Preston party, of
the Harrison parly, or opposed to the
administration, are invariably also opposed
to Col. Richardson, and in favor of
one or other of these gentlemen.
We might extend the commentary to
much greater length, but think we have
said enough to relieve every candid mind
from embarrassment, how to decide to
which of the candidates for next Governor,
the preference should be given. That
farther discussion will bring out new facts,
which may change the aspect of the controversy,
is to be expected, and when they j
do appear none will be more prompt to
appreciate their force, than one who,
without b shadow of personal interest in
the question, is therefore, of either candidate.
NG PARTISAN.
From the Globe.
CONVINCED AGAINST HIS WILL.
The following shows the Journal of
Commerce to be a convert to our doctrines
about the credit system. The war which
we waged for years against Mr. Riddle's
bloated business, consisting of credit and
speculation, was once looked upon by the
commercial organ as a war upon the mercantile
interest. Now what does he say
of the matter: "Jl/r. Biddlc has caused the
ruin of more busiiiess men than have been
overthrown by all other causes for the last
twenty years.11 If, then, General Jackson
could have arrested this ' tremendous
quack" in the administration of his nostrums?if
the corruption which purchased !
a new diploma for him in the Pennsylva-!
nia Legislature could have been prevented,!
41 the destruction of a whole race of mer- J
chants" might have been arrested. We
are glad to see that the organ of the mer-|
chants now speaks rationally. The sensible
men of the class it represents, now !
know that ' financiering" meant cheating;
that "credit system'' meant a system with-;
out capital; that "doing a great business" j
meant " doing nothing" but speculating;
anil llint imirorcal nrncnprilv meant that
every man had the efligy of wealth in pos-'
session in borrowed paper money, and
the fictitious prices it imparts to property;
"The United States Bank.?-This
institution seems to be making some de-:
cisive movements, corresponding with its
present condition. Mr.. Copperthwaite,!
the cashier, has resigned; the president j
has rplinornishcd 82.000 of his salary, and j
ihe number of officers and clerks is to be
reduced one-half. This looks like abandoning
the expansion policy, and gives us 1
reason to hope, that whatever the condition
of the Bank may be, the best will 1
now be made of it. What is to become '
jf the ten thousand dollar salaries paid
for the management of our two hundred
thousand dollar branch? * ,
" We hope our financiers will 6ee the |
snd of the Biddie policy, its utter un- ,
soundness and folly. Endless expansion j
s not the way to pay debts, neither do >
nigh salaries and a great display of esla- )
alishment constitute a safe basis of credit, f
The old fashioned notion of keeping your <
expenses within your income, is worth j
more than all the new schemes of splen- ]
did financiering. At one lime Mr. Bid- i
die's false principles of finance Taised him |
high in popular favor. His doctrines pro- ,
claimed peace to daring speculators, and <
temporary ease to all. But the end has
been the overthrow of our institutions, (
and the destruction of almost a whole race
of merchants. We have no doubt that,
take it all in all, Mr. Biddie has caused
the ruin of more business men in this
country, than have been overthrown by
all other causes united for the last twenty
years. Yet, such was the trust reposed
in his skill, that men seemed rather to prer

and the world is rapidly coming

The Ginral's Speech.?The speech
delivered by Harrison at Fort Meigs
shews the wisdom of the friends who
corked him ?op, to keep until after the
election. A more wretched and vulgar
piece of drivelling egotism, and point-nopoint
booing for popularity, could hardly
have beenjinvented as a burlesque! It is
a regular dogberry affair. The Whigs
had better stable hint again, before the
people get the full measure of his ears.

Artificial Rain.?Professor Espy has !
addressed a letter to the editor of the Phi- i
ladelphia National Gazette in]which he re- 1
fers to his discovery of the mode of pro- I
ducing rain by artificial means, in the fol- '
lowing terms: 1
As to the possibilty of producing rains
artificially in time of drought, I learned
from Major Tenney and Mr. Ogden, ot
Louisiana, that they had both separately 1
tried the experinent last summer in time
of a most distressing drought with entire
success. Major. Tenney saw the cloud
from over the fire and the rain come down
through the clear blue sky below, and Mr.
Ogden. informed me that it rained on all
his neighbors east of him but not in the
west. One of these gentlemen saved a
large mass of timber which had been cut
down to clear his land, and the other had
a salt marsh on the west of his farm,
which burns freely in time of drought.
I request gentlemen who may have the
means of trying this experiment during my
absence, to send an .account of their success
or failure to Wm. Hamilton, Esq.
Actuaiy of the Franklin Institute," Phifadeiphia.
They must set fire to their ,
materials only when all the following cir- i
cumstanccs concur. A drought?a^calm i
air?or a very gentle breeze from the >
eastward?a clear day, and a high dew- '
point. This latter may be ascertained 1
by putting a thermometer (Fahrenheit) '
in'o a tumbler of water and finding how 1
many degrees it will nave to be below tiie
temperature of the air from 12 to 2 o'clock
in the days tliat the vapor in the air will
condense on its outside.
The highest temperature at which it
will condense, is called the dew-point, and
if it should not be more than ten degrees
below the temperature of the air at noon
it may be considered favorable ; and if it
should be less than ten degrees it would
be better. I hope this experiment will
be repeatedly tried this summer, and the
news of success reach me in a foreign
land.
If it should succeed, it is probable the
rain will widen out from the place of beginning,
moving eastwardly or south-eastwardly
until it reaches the Atlantic, not
raining much, if any, west of the place of
commencement. Nothing, however, but
experiments can decide these points, and
others which might be named, such as
whether the steam power in the air may
be so kept down by regular- artificial rains
as to prevent the possibility of tornadoes
and destructive hail storms which can
only occur when the dew-point is high.
m. /? 11 r% . n X r f
The louowing continuation 01 lvir. :
Espy's theory of producing artificial rain ]
occurred last fall near Sniethport, M'Kean ]
co., Pa. It is reported by the editor of i
the Sniethport Tiler. The weather had i
been dry for several weeks, when Mr. i
John Ilolmes, set fire to seven acres of 1
very heavy fallow land, just back of the 1
town. The heat and smoke arising from 1
it was tremendous, and the same night a ?
storm of rain fell at Smethport and the
vicinity. The weather was then clear ]
for a day or two until Mr. II. had logged j
up his fallow lands and fired his logheaps,
when the rain began again and continued I
for several days; only clearing up when <
the fuel was all consumed. t

Russian Superstition?We were taking 1
our tea with Madame # * #, when M. d'Er- \
bain raised his creeking voice and pro- c
nounced the Russians to be the most su- c
perstitious people on the face of the globe. .
"Don't you know (said he) that in many 1
bouses salt, sans a cellar, is put upon a '
table, in order to prevent an unlucky cap- (
size? Are you not aware that nothing of J
importance is undertaken on a Monday?
[lave you never seen a nurse shrink in (
Jismav when you have extolled the fresh- x
ness and good looks of her child; and (

Have you never seen the common people j;
spit behind them to drive away the devil?!J
Don't you know that persons in mourning !
are deemed of fatal augury in all societies, 1
particularly at christenings, nuptial do- I
ings, and festive banquets?" When the '
Russian peasantry perceive that they doi'
not succeed with beasts of one color, they]
change them for another. Chickens, tur- 1
keys, ducks, and all that fry, are com- '
prised in the sentence. Nay, were you to 1
give them a cow, difTeiing in the slightest (
degree from their lavorite tint, they would I
get rid of it, lest she place the whole es- 1
tablishmer.t in jeopardy. M d'Erbain up- '
raided the Russian ladies also, with their
taste for ghost stories. Every region has 1
its story-teller; Prince JBelloselsky, a man
of extremely amiable character, had most
a delightful imagination in all that concerned
the "bogles;"?he was one evening
at a largo parly, when the ladies 6tormed
him en masse, with?"Dear Prince, pray
set our hair on end!" The prince required
that every light should be put out, except
a single candle, which was to be left in an

prince had enough on his hands Defore

GENERAL HARRISON.
* Wc devoted a large portion of our paper last
week to laying before our readers some of the recent
lettors of Gen. Harrison, in order that they
might learn, as far as possible, the opinions which
lie entertains on the great qnestions of national policy,
which now agitate the country. If they have
boon able, however, to form any definite idea in relation
to these matters, from what he has seen fit to
write, tlicy have done inoro than wc had the ability
to do' After perusing and rcperusing, what he has
written, for the purpose of explanation, the only
effect has been to'make " confusion worse confounJed."
Except, indeed, it bo in that portion of his
tetter, where he refers to his " Conscience keeping
C'ommittce;" in that he is clear onough, and sets his
friends right, who have kindly taken upon themselves
to deny its existence. We continuo the subjoct
this week for the purpose of giving our readers
some of tho old gentleman's writings which we had
beforo inadvertently omitted, and some which have
come to hand since our last publication. The
friends of the old General are ready to defend him
from every charge that may be brought against him,
and are always supplied with precisely " the docu.
mcnts" necessary to meet it. This they are enabled
Lo do with the aid of his old speeches and letters, in
which may be found sentiments for, and against,
every measure which has ever been deemed of suf
ficicnt importance to attract public attention. Ev-.ry
individual, whether he be tariff, or anti-tariff?Bank
ar anti-Bank?internal improvement or anti.interna
improvement, abolition or anti-abolition may find is
" the documents" which the committee were directed
to furnish, precisely the creed that suits him
We have not space to publish, or leisure to hunt uf
all the evidence which might be adduced to prove the
position which wo havo taken. To show, however
the facility with which tho General may be provec
from his own assertions, to be cither one thing 01
another, as it may be the policy of his friends t<
prove him, we subjoin tho copy of a letter to the
Hon. Jons Owes, of North Carolina, and a Circu
lar published somctinio previous. The advocates 01
tho Gcnoral, iu the South, will perceive, how strong
in argument they have in favor of his high regard
to Southern Institutions, by a perusal of the circu
!ar on the left, and the abolitionists will be deligbtcc
.vith the one on the right. Wo havo also added tc
he circular, a sentiment from one of the Goneral'i
speeches on a public occasion. The following ar<

more cautious in the expression of his opinions;
than lie has been, since he has been partially released
from the surveillance of his Committee, we shall
soon expect to hear of his being' again put under

NORTH EASTERN BOUNDARY.
We mentioned a short time since, th t tho Seers(
tar/of Legation to the Court of Great Britain, had
arrived in the .Great Westfern, with despatches to oar
government, which were supposed to be a favorable
i answer to the last proposition made to Great Britain,
on the subject of the Boundary. This supposition,
i we are happy to learn lias been justified. The British
'government, it is asserted, has accepted the
proposition with some slight and unimportant modiI
ficitions. Under this arrangenrentt it is uaderstoSd,
I that there is to be a Convention for the purpose of
i exploring, and surveying the boundary as defined by
i the Treaty of 1783, with an umpire to decide all
i questions upon which the Commissioners disagree.
AFRICAN SLAVE TRADE.
I The first Anniversary of "tire Society for the
i extinction of the Slave trado, and ?or the civiliza,
tion of Africa," was held at Exetof1 Hall, England,
on the 1st June, at which<Prince'*AuiMT presided,
' assisted by a large number of the nobility. The
, meeting was attended by a great jnany foreigners of
I talent .and distinction^ The report of the proceedi
ings of this meeting provfe, notwithstanding all tho
efforts which have been made for the suppression of
. The African slave trade, that instead of diminishing,
> it is on tho increase. A new and gigantic achcmo
> lias been suggested for the purpose of accomplish^
, ing this great object. It is the execution of"thi?
I suggestion which brought into existence tho society,
r tire first anniversary of which we ore noticing. Tbo
? plan proposed for putting an end to this traffic, is
; the civilization of Africa, by the introduction of
- Christianity, and the gcncihl diffusion of the arts of
f civilized life; and turning the attention of the Chiefs,
f for the purposo of satisfying their ccpidity, from the1
sale of their people, to trade and commerce. Tho
- spread of the christian religion in Africa, is an object
1 which should command the universal approbation of
> every christian and pliilanthropists.

Tiie Lady's Book.?The July Lumber of this
beautiful arid interesting publication, has reached us
1 with its accustomed promptitude. Its contents are
entirely original, and its literary cbaraclor ably and
fully sustained. Tho articles in the present number,
to our mind seem to be characterised by a higher and
purer tone of morul and pious feeling, than somo of
^ its predecessors, though the work has always been,
^ in tliis respect, of an elevated character. It is
handsomely embellished with a beautiful plate of
fashions, containing four figures, and a splendid
r steel engraving, " View of Constantinople."
r The Evergreen.?We are indebted to the publisher,
Mr. J. Winchester, New York for the July
number of this neat and cheap publication. Its
contents arc higldy interesting, and tho work pro1
misos, from the number and talent of its'contributcrs,
I* to be a valuable addition to the periodical literature
j of the day. It contains 56 pages, and is published
j monthly at ?2 per annum.
B Rail Road Celebration.?On Saturday last, wo
U Icam from tho Charleston Courier, the opening of
. the Rail Road to Orangeburg, was celebrated with
E great spirit in that village. A large ^prty from
s Charleston attended, and a numerous company from
