im- New Paper.?We have received the first and 6ejla.
cond numbers of a new paper, published in Columi

of GEN. HARRISON?CORRECTION.
A friend has called our attention to tho following
,n sentence in our editorial of last week, where wc
1 a*1 were contrasting the opinions of General Harrison,
ng. at difforcnt periods, viz: "We have not pursued 1
a either, tlie disingenuous course, which 6omo of his 1
enemies have been charged with, by making garbled '
' quotations from his letters, but we have, in every
!)0" instance, laid the whole before them." He has 1
se, shown us also, that wc did not lay the whole of the '
,l. r> it- i? ?? ,? ?
me viciiciui b uucuiur uwuru our rentiers, aii wo can 1
rts say in explanation is, that we published all that we
had ever seen of it, up to the day on which the
GT Journal was printed. We take pleasure however
alr now, in making all the amends in our power, by
vp, giving the circular entire in this day's paper. It is
iis. a " document" mightily relied on by the Southern
er- wh'?9> to prove the correctness of Gen. Harrison,
in relation to Southern institutions; and they are
ro* welcome to tlic benefit of the whole of it. It will
be perceived that wo published scarcely one-fourth
ar- of the " document" last week, but if the remainder
ill is any less objectionable than the former pait, then
wc confess our ignorance of Southern feeling. This
circular was written to explain and defend his voto on
the Missouri question, and he puts it on this ground,
al- bccauso the territorry of Louisiana, of which Mis.
rd- souri was a part, was purchased under a "solemn
[cr covenant with France," to recognize and preserve in.
j. violate the ri?ht of the master over the slavo. His
sentiments however may be seen from the last sentence
in the circular, be says:
" We cannot emancipate the Slaves of
?ns the other States without their consent,
th, but by producing a_ convulsion which ,
0j. would undo us all. For this much to be
na desired event, we must wait the slow but
? certain progress of those good principles,
1Pt which arc every where gaining ground,
and which assuredly will ultimately preum
vail."
0 f What "good principles" aro those to which ho refers
r(js in this sentonco? Aro they the principles which ho
professes, and which 14 will ultimately prevail" un.
dcr his administration, if this country should com.
mit the great folly of electing him to the Presidential
Chair? Wo seriously ask, is there any Southern
aid, man, is thcro any Carolinian who desires to see
these " good principles" to which General Harrison
Qf refers, ultimately prevail?" As the opinions of Gen.
Harrison, on the subject of slavery, are becoming
11 ^ more and more important cvory day. from tho position
lie occupies as a prominent candidate for the
Presidency, we shall make no apology to our readers
for dwelling a little longer on the subject, and con.
lj.y trusting his opinions expressed at different times with
m"_ those which the South entertains. On tho 6th Janua,
ry, 1820, in the Legislature of Ohio, the following
e s Preamble and Resolution were returned from the
ce? House of Representatives to the Senate:
PREAMBLE.
"Whereas the existence of slavery in
i the United States must ever be regard*
as a moral and roLrricA.l jevil, ana tl
extension thereof, in its tendency, direct
calculated to impair tiie national ch
racter, and materially affect the iiapi
ness of the people; and inasmuch

acting on the broad principles of phila
. thropy, are laudably uniting, to preve
the extension of traffic in human bcinj
that the United States, who are so imm
diately interested in this important subjei
who understand so well their own rigln
and who have so much to dread from tl
extension of slavery into the interior
this vast republic; and who have it in the
power to prevent the evil, will rot i
pass the present opportunity, but will, I

Wo ask our readers to reflect on this preamble an
resolution, and see if they do not contain sentiment
and exhibit principles ut war with the best interests <
tho Southern country. 'We ask them if they ca
consent to aid in fastening these principles on tli
country, by contributing their influcnco to raise Gei
Harrison to the Presidency. We scarcely need as
tho citizens of Kershaw District, if they will aid i
such a suicidal act, for they have already expresse
their opinions?opinions diametrically opposed to tli
very first position assumed by Gen. Harrison, wliic
is, that slavery " must ever be regarded as a mora
and political evil." As long sir.ee as 1835, Ui
people of Kershaw, ever watchful and joalons of an
encroachments on their rights, expressed fully i
public meeting their sentiments on this cngrossin
subject. To show how immediately and directly o[
posed arc tho opinions expressed by Gen. IIarriso>
and those entertained by Kershaw District, we cop;
two of the resolutions adopted at the period rcfcrrei
to viz:
" Resolved, That slavery, as it exists with us
we deny to be an evil, and that we regard thosi
who are now making war upon it, in any shape, o
under any pretext, as furious fanatics or knaves am
hypocrites; and wo hereby promise them, upon al
occasions which may put them in our power, th<
Pate of the pirate, the incendiarv and the midmgii'
assassin.
Rosohcd, That we shall regard any attempt 01
die part of Congress, to abolish slavery, suddenly
)r gradually, in any State, Territory or District
,vhcre the institution now exists, by appropriation ol
die public funds, or by other means; or any attompl
iy Congress to regulate the manner in which slaves
nay be sold or transferred from one State to another
>r any resolution or act of Congress, adverse to sla.
eery, as a reckless violation of our C onstitutional,
jompact, as a wicked and direct infringement of oui
ights, and as involving the certain and speedy dis.
rolution of this Union."
Theso resolutions contain tho deliberate and re.
:ordod opinions, not only of this District, but ol
he whole South, and wo beg our readers to comiare
them carefully with those of Gen. Harrison,
ind see if one is not the antipode of the other; one
tsscrts emphatically that slavery is a moral and ro.
litical evil, and tho other says in equally strong
anguage " we dfny it to be an evil." On a qucs.
don of such vital importance, can we tolerate s<
adical a difference of opinion? Wo quit the subject
for the present, fully convinced that Gen. IIarriso>
has snid enough to prove that he is at heart, and in
principle (if he has any) an abolitionist.

but a moment to answer a few of the calumnies
which are inj circulation concerning
me.
"I am accused of being friendly to slavery.
From my earliest youth to the present
moment, I have been the ardent
rriend to human liberty. At the age o/
[8, I became a member of an abolition
society, established at Richmond, Virgilia;
the object of which was to ameliorate
he condition of slaves, and procure [their
rreedom by every legal means My vene able
friend Judge Gatch, of Cler/nont
:ounty, was also a member of that socie,y.
and has lately given rne a certificate
hat I was one. The obligations which 1
hen came under, I have faithfully performed.
I have been the means of liberaing
many slaves, but never placed one in
tondage. I deny that my votes in Con
jress, in relation to Missouri and Arkan;as,
are in the least incompatible with
hese principles. Congress had no more
egal or constitutional right to emancipate
he negroes in those sections of Louisiana,
vithout the consent of their owners, than
hey have to free those of Kentucky.
2d These people were secured in their p
he pcrty by a solemn covenant with Frai
]y when the country ypas purchased fr
^ that power. To prohibit the cmigrat
?I_ of citizens of the Southern Stales to i
' part of the country, the situation and
mate of which,- was peculiarly suite<
Jn them, would have beet? highly unjust
t0 it had purchased out of the comr
>n' fund. Particularly, too, when it is re>
lectcd that all the immense territory to
Northwest of fhe Ohio, had been ce
ry by Virginia, ar.d that with an unexamf
ur liberality, she had herself proposed by
Hy eluding slavery from it, to secure it for
lal emigration of- those States which had
ic- slaves. . Was it proper, then, when
its reserved territory was in a great meas
ng filled up,* to exclude her citizens fi
,ut every part of the territory purchased
n_ of the common fund? I was lite first j
s%n to introduce into Congress the j
rg position that all the country above j
' ' souri, (which having no inhabitants,
free from the objection made to Mis?<
' and Arkansas,) should never have slav
^s' admitted into it. I repeat what I h
before said, that as our Union was o
o* effected by mutual concession, so o
i can it be preserved.
eL "My vote against the restiiclion of 3
>y souri in forming her constitution, was
a conclusive one; there would have b
[Y | time enough, had I continued to I
d, member, before the question wasdecit

J NATIONAL ANNIVERSARY
Our National Anniversary was celebrated on S
turday last with'more spirit, than it has been for soi
years. The day was ushered in by tho ringing
r bells and the firing of cannon. According to pi
vious arrangements, our citizens, both civil and n
litary, assembled at the Court House at 9 o'cloi
> A. 31.. and proceeded to tho election of an Orat<
and the appointment of a Committee of Arrang
[ monts, for tho next Anniversary. Capt. James
Dickinson was elected Orator, and Alex. Joilnso

t1 Committee of Arrangements.
'< j A procession was then formed and marched
i the Presbyterian Church, under the command of Ci
Haile, as Marshall of the Day, assisted by Maj
Murray, where, after an appropriate prayer by t
Rev. R. B. Campbell, the declaration of Indepc
' dcnce was read by Capt. James P. Dickinson, afl
! which tho following Ode composed by Miss Piieli
' for the occasion, was sung by the Choir:
1!
Arise, arise and wake tho story,
Of brave Columbia's valiant power,
That crowned hor fields with deeds of glory,
i In dark oppression's trying hour,
Shall foreign Despot, sword unsheathing,
E'or tread again this gallant land,
While her brave sons, dovoted stand,
Fair Freedom's spirit proudly breathing?
No, no, her shores we love,
Our hearts' best blood shall flow,
Ere she shall foreign bondage jirove,
Or home-born tyrant know.
This day behold her banners waving,
And hear her bugle's pealing sound,
The caverns deep and mountains braving,
Its notes of victory echo round;
And should its peal awake the slumbers,
Of those who sought their gory bed,
Triumphant to the patriot dead,
Let glory's plumo inspire its numbers;
To-day let pceans riso
To Heaven-born liberty,
Aloud proclaiming to the skies,
A Nation's Jubilee.
