Judge Taylor took his sent, and the Grand
Jury being in Court, the Judge informed
them of the outrage upon the ri;hts of the
cotuntry committed in the puruming ofthe
records. and chareed them spr illy to fer

ascertaiined that the Clerk's box or desk
with all the dockets, papers, &e., cetntaint
ed itn it a'e above menctioned, were taken
into the wroode and burnt. I visited the
spot to day, and no doubt can exist as to

of the Court ilon-e and proclaitmetl that
the sale wout~ld then comnce, and began
to read from the advertisement, when three
or tonr strong ment seized him and carried
him off iel armil! Judge Taylor npon be
ing infrmed tf the afir, repaired imme
d:ately to the Court house and ordered
the Sherifi to stummon a suffcient guard,
and to arrest the mob who bad carried off
the Deputy by violence-which wvas ac
cordingly dune, and somie two or three
were overtaken and errested, :and stand
indicted Iby special presentment for resist
ing the oflicer, &c. The Sheriff then pro
ceeded to sell (or rather to attempt to sell.)
The people were barrangued by some
man, wshum I could not see, forowarning
persons present not to bid for property.
I i.s impossibsle to tell how many were de
terminetd to prevent a sale-unless to sup
pose0 that a majority acquiesced in it. One
man I saw, who with a most barbarous
look and gesture, absolutely forbade any
bidding whatever, I knew hcim not, but I
never shall forget his visage. A mad wvild
cat could tnot have looked more demon
like, his teeth gritted as be spoke, and ho
shook his head, and threatened that the
man who dared to bid shotuld be teell mobbed,
TIhe mtnt was a stranger to me. I was in
teretedt irt the She-ill's sale. but felt that if
I bid, it wrold lbe at the peril of my life
Some eight or ten stood round as spokes
men, and as thce Sheriff would offer an ar
ticle osf property for -.ale, they would say
"no bid." Sic that out of an advertise
ment of t wo or three columns in a news
paper, the ShceritT sildl but twns acts of
land-otno for five dollars and the other
for fifty, which was permitted, as it wans
otly to perfect titles.
Judye Taylor met this crisis with firm
ness and decision, and called upon the
Grand Jury, as the right arm of the critni

and manty persons did not anticipate a ver

stnding the tm'anifest atrocity of the deed,
there was something of a fray attendling it.

that the prisoner provoked the fray. The

as much out of reach ofthe ebullitions of pub.
lic excitement. as is consistent with the charac

caution, however, to secure this right to the
Judges, they have inflicted upon the State an
incalculable amount of expense, resulting from
the imbecility and natural declenasion incident
to increasing years and infirmities. It is a sub
