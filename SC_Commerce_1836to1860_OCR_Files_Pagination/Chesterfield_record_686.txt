a part wore planted till Monday morning.
Of the last planted, not one in one hundred
ever came npv; of the Saturday plantinir,
about one half.
The next experiment was with potatoes.
Made n compost of ashes, plaster, saltpetre
and urine ; cut two bu9hela of potatoes,
and soaked them three days; not
one piece came up.
Last February 1 had turned over about
two and a half acres of meadow land,
that had beon mowed several voars. One
acre I reserved for turaips; the balance
planted with potatoes. On the potato
ground I put tea heavy ox cart loads of
stable manure ; plowed, harrowed and left
smooth, and planted with seven different !
kinds, about the 20th of May. There
are 112 rows, 3 feet apart, 65 hills on a
row,?about an equal number of each ,
kind. The potatoes were all cut, and |
two pieces put in a hill;?and now lor
the experiment. I took 100 weight ol j

W'll mention one fact more. It is probably
known to all, that oxen and cows are very

I expect to use OU or iut? weigmoi .sdnpetreon
the turnip patch, and some hundred on
d held preparing for rye. 1 think 1 shall sow
it oil the land, and bush or harrow it over.
1 will say to my brother firmers, tliat I J
am well convinced, not only from experiments
this year, but other year*, that it is not best
to tinker and soak our seed grains too much.
Manure the hand, and do the-work as we
ought.; plant our 6eeds in the natural dry
state,?and on the great whole I believe it to
be the best way. It is true that corn wil
come up with a small quantity of tar, and it
will in a measure prevent the crows from pulling
; it but we are apt to use too much, as i
think was the case with myself in using saltpetre.
I have this season three acres of win
ter wheat, and ten years out of eleven I have
never raised any that looked as well. It is
true, last fall 1 soaked the seed wheat in sait
and water for a few hours, and then rolled in
lime, and I do not think it hurt; but I believe
my wheat would have been good this year if
I had not done it.
-Now Mr. Ed tor, I am about to slate a few
facta, and wish ne. theories,about it. ft our
friend Ives, (perhaps I ought to add the M.
D.t) m his classical description of the Hog or
Corn Root, hard said Skunk's Cabbage, without
so many Latin and Greek words, he I
would have been as well understood bv a
great majority of the readers of the Cruzelte,
and perhaps by tho Editor himself, as he now
is. It is a fact, that our neat cattle and
sheep arc very fond of the leaves of the skunk's
cabbage, when cured and foddered to them in
the winter season,?as much so as they are!
ofdiiedcorn leaves?and will eat thorn as j
readily ; but they areas shy of them in t lie
g"een state, and will never go no near them,
or feed near them if they can avoid it, as one
of thecity dandy jocks are of a skunk in a
pleasent moon-shiuy night.?Excuse me ; per.
haps it would have been more polite to have i
had pole. If the brute creation have no more i
judgement of what suits their taste than the
human species, 1 pity them. It is known to
all that the Indian weed calleJ to tobacco J

his delicious taste by cramming it into his

j entirely in connection with myself, I
i thoijght an account of it might not piorc
; uninteresting to you. Early in tho summer
of 1310, as I was one morning reclining
on mv couch, in the back room, the
doors being open, a very small bird came
j hopping in, and ran about the floor appar;
entlv in quest of something to eat. 1 hapj
pened to have a so !a biscuit by me, and
instantly threw it some crumbs, which it
ran to and ate as if very hungry. In a
few minutes it flew out. Before long it
! returned bringing another with it. I fed
' them both plentifully, and they flew out.
In a short time one returned, and partook
again ; after a whilo tho other ; so they
continued through the day. I did not
think of seeing them any more, but I had
no sooner taken up my accustomed place
on my couch the next morning, than in
came one of my little visitors, quite tarne,
and quiteat home; it ran near me, took as
hasty breakfast nnd ran out. Soon it
mate came, and took bis in quite as friendly
a manner.
1 -ms th^y continued corning from ten
i . "
to t.iirty times a day, and soon became
so attached to their hostess that they
woula seldom take their meal, ever ready
on a clean paper by the door, but would
run ol/teo mv nnd look Uf) to Hie.

to have me drop it to them at anv side,
which they would taIce, perfectly unconcerned.
They appeared for a time quite
afraid of strangers, particularly children,
and would look to me, as they came in, as
if to ask, is it safe? However, they soon
lost their fears of them, and would come
in when three or four were present. After
a few weeks they began to carry away
large pieces every time they came, after
satisfying their hunger, which convinced
me they had little ones to feed, and I was
astonished to see what a little load they
would carry, oftentimes three pieces at
once, as large as half a large pea.
Thus they continued visiting me for
months until some time in the last of Sep(ember,
just after tea, at the edge of a delightful
evening. 1 heard such a chirping
and chattering as almost deafened me.
In an instant the little mother appeared,
enticing along her dear little ones, which i
were almost splitting their little throats'
with their chattering, and soon the father,
appeared. They ran up the steps into i
the room, and stopped just in the door, i

ran to ine very hastily, stopped at my
side, looked up in my face, and began to '
talk, she thought, as intelligently as any
person would, conversing with me. I
never was more astonished. I supposed
that she was asking me to protect her ,
Utile ones. She stood in this manner ai
few moments, talking as fast as she could, j
when she ran hack to her children, and
they all commenced eating their abundant
meal, which had been prepared for j
them.?When finished, they (low out,
and visited me no more. I was then
convinced that the mother was expressing
her gratitude instead of asking protec.
tion.
I mourned the loss of my daar little '
family, not expecting ever to s. e them j
again; when, O, how was I delighted, as |
sitting at my hod-room one Sunday morn- )
. O
ing, early in the month of the next June, I
tlie dear Utile creature that first made its |
appearance came running up the walk,
directly to the door. Feeling very ill,
and the morning being rainy, I could not
go to let it in (the family being at church)J
and was obliged to let it go away?which
it did very broken-heartedly, after waiting
some time?without giving it a welcome.
I reconciled myself, thinking it would
return the next dayj; hut I waited for it
and it did not coino, and I had entirely
given up the idea of seeing it any more ;
when, how was I overjoyed ona morning,
to sec it flv in at the door and ruin directly
to my couch ! She sloped directly before
me, looked up and began to chipper.
I answered hcrlitilo ' how dye do," and
gave her some breakfast. She ran out
and soon her mate came. They then
continued their visits from ten to forty
tunes a day, sometimes together, sometimes
alone, would often slav and run about
the room, and appeared delighted (
when I felt able to answer th^ir prattle, j
On stormy days, not being ablu to bear
tiic damp air from an open duo-, when
finding it closed, they would come to the
window and lluttei, begging to come in. j
1 would open the door a little space,;
just large enough for them to pass through;j
they would immediately fly to the scraper j
and crowd through, evidently delighted
and try to show their grititude. After
taking their meal, totally unconcerned at
being shut in, they would amuse them
selves awhile, then crowd out again and
fly to their nest. Thus they continued
their visits to mo.again for months, quite
at home, and f.r several of the Ust weeks
carrying awav a largo mess every visit,
r->
which convinced me thev hud again a j
little charge to feed, when one beautiful
C '
morning, about ten o'clock, such chirping
ali of a sudden! and inn moment I had
five little visitors on the threshhold of the
door, tlie young ones fluttering and chirp,
ing so as almost to deafen me, but appearing
so happy as hardly to know what
to do.
I threw down a largo mess of crumbs,
when the parents instantly ran tome and
took thctn to their little just fledged children,
put it in their mouths, und again
and again for some minutes : after being
P ' O
sufficiently fed all flew out. Thus they <
continued to come, at times altogether, ;
sometimes the little ones, one or two nt I
once, sometimes one alone, for several
clays, hut generally three or four together,
and hardly leaving mealone at nil, running
round my feat when at table, and
picking up the mites as they fell, and trying
to am isc mo. In about two weeks
they all came at once, after tea, took an

I In a letter from a gentleman in Scot- !
j land to the Editors of the Albany Culti- i
I vator, tho writer desir- sto correct a misj
tako which lie saysexists in this country, j
! viz : that the Durham short cattle nreesrrrnnl
milkers in Great Britain.
1 * o*"
: \Vc% lie remarks, consider the superior excellence
of high-bred Durham* to rest up-1
I on their fine shape, great size, early ilia- ;
f turity, unci aptitude to fatten; We have {
' no doubt that exactly the same state of
: thin"*exists in Great Britain that obtains
. . v.: .r ;
| in this country, that is, there is a divi- i
i sion in opinion, there us well as here/
; upon the merits and properties of this
! breed of cattle. We believe, top, that:
the two parties, both here nnd there, although
apparently diametrically opposed,
are both right. Those svho contend tor !
I the great milking qualities of the Dur- j
| hams are certainly right, if the possession j
I of this property by very many of the in- |
j dividends of the stock will justify them in '
j the general assertion ; and the same re. j
j mark may he made, with equal or greater |
, force, of those who contend for the op- j
p isite quality of aptitude to fatten. The j
explanation of the apparent paradox lies
j i i this; the Durhams are a stock of cat!
tie bred and crossed judiciously, with an
j eye to securing the valuable qualities of
t ic animal. But the valuable qualities
of framed cattle unlike any other quadruped
are of two characters, generally supposed
to be opposite and inconsistent in
their nature; they furnish a solid and
fl iirl nutriment to man. The shane and
I
form which promises to afford the one to i
the greatest advantage, is very different !
from that which indicates the other, hut;
being nearly equal in value the judicious |
breeder has retained either the one or the
other, a* he happened to meet with them. ,
The consequence is that the present race,!
taking sometimes after another sometimes ;
displays lite milking, and sometimes th,e
fattening form. 'Tis true, that in the
south of Britain, where this stock is chiefly
raised, beef is more valued than milk,
and, therefore, we believe, that both there '
and here, tiio property of making the one, :
predominates over the tendency to yield
other, simply because this quality has
been most carefully cultivated. *Wc
know whole herds of this stock in' this
neighborhood, purchased chiefly for their
supposed universal milking qualities* j
where not one individual in ten turns out.
a valuable milkei. y j
But the Durham is unquestionably a i
highly artificial stock, requiring a continuance
of the high keep and generous care-..
that have been so instrumental in bringing
them to their present state of prrfec- 1
tion. We bcl.cve that there are several 1
hreeds much luitter adapted to the scanty j
herbage of Eistern Virginia,and we con- \
cur fully with the writer, to whom we [
have alluded above, in his national predi-J
lection for the Ayrshires. He says: j
"The Ayrshires are a diminutive variety
of Short Horns. They are in great repute
as milkers, and are fast spreading over
these islands. They are in every sense ,1.
'the poor man's cow.' They thrive and
give a g'od portion of milk upon very
short commons where larger breed* would 1
starve. There are also high breds, Or j
well breds among the Ayrshires, ?* in
the Durham*, and with similar qualifications
with the exception of size."

From an old Virginia turfman, who is I
too modest to.give his name to the public, '
we have derived the following statement. .
He says for the last nine or ten years he '
has been making use of the following renr.;]
edy for grubs, with instantaneous and in-'
variable succes.
Upon a piece of chalk, the size of a cu-"}
hie inch, he pours a pint of moderately,
strong vinegar ; when the effervescence I
has ceasod, he empties it into .a bottle, |
and drenches the patient. . . . . . 9
We know no gentleman upon whose judg-t

than the one affording this recipe, and heesteemed
it so highly* that he called at :

The Into New Orleans papers give nn
account of an attack by a party of Mexicans
on one of the outposts near Snn Patricio,
in which they wero repulsed with
loss, by a general force of volunteers statinned
there. The enemy, (says the
Crescent City,) on the morning of the 7th
inst., about day light, made an attack tip.
on the camp at Lipantitlan, near San Pa- 1
tricio. His force consisted of about 500 I
mounted rancheros, and 200 regular sol- j
dier.s, also mounted, with one field piece? '
a four nour.d gun. They were command- !
ed by Cam lis. The force of Gen. Davis

The Mexican People.?The editor
of the New Orleans Picayune, who understands
Mexican matters well, has the
following notice of Santa Anna and the
Mexicans :?
1
" Santa Anna?We must say that ,
our opinions of the man have materially i
changed for the better since his recent net
of -liberating the Texan prisoners. We <
hnve always known that Santa Anna did
not authorize, and found it difficult to be- <
licve that he sanctioned, the inhuman : 1
treatment the Texan prisoners received :
from the time they were captured until '
theyTeachcd the Passo del Norte. 'Hie '
fact of his chaining the prisoners, too,after 1
arrived at the city of Mexico, can be j J
overlooked if he can prove that their safe- j {
keeping demanded such a course ; hut 1 f
nothing can excuse his placing these ; t
men in the streets and ^compelling thein (
to work. Santa Anna may offer, in pal. j,
iation, that he himself narrowly escaped j 1
with his life while a prisoner in Texas, ! t
that he was heavily chained there, and ' '
that his men were compelled to work up- '<
on the different fortifications nnd plnnta- 1
tions in the neighborhood of Victoria and j 1
Galveston ; but all this doe9 not justify a I c
retaliation so severe, in fact a retaliation
of uny kind.
We believe that he is the only man fit- .
. t
ted to govern the mass of the Mexican I }
people. Ths most popular man in Mexi- i j
co perhaps is Gome/ Farias, and he is j t
doubtless the most ultra, thorough-going I v
republican, as well as the most honest of p
the Federalists, t lit lie well knows that j
his countrymen arc not prepared for a {I
government baaed upon his own liberal !a
opinions, however readily they arc dispos- j1
ed to support him in any movement he j
may suggest. He is too pure a man and | c
loves his country too well to plunge it in- ,^
to anarchy and confusion, nnd hesitates :
to raise a whirlwind of revolution which
designing men might profit by, and he (
himself would never he able to direct to- {
ward the general good. 1
On o(li?r lot it J, Santa Anna ix pc- t
culiarly well fitted to govern a population c
which his experience has taught him are ' p
incapaldo of self-government?a popula- a
tion he has dwelt among, mingled among, 0
and figured among, until, to use u com- 1
ni*n phrase, 44 he knows them as well as ! ^
if he had raised them." His general v
i
policy, too, albeit somewhat tinctured j
with n'tra rnonarchial notions, is as liberal
as tho state of education in Mexico j J
will allow, and if this policy is carried
out he will raise Mexico to a higher etni- a
nence in the scale of nations than any j,
course the Federal party can devise. At : f,
the same time while we could wish to t:
see the plans of tho latter carried out, we o
still cannot hope that they will he sue- ii
cessful until education is more generally
disseminated." j P
CONGRESSIONAL ANALYSIS?SENATE. a
Thursday, August 4, 1811. v
The special order, after a good deal of misccl- [
laneous business, was called; and Mr. Allen took : <"
the floor and moved an amendment to make salt J 11
duty free. He followed up the motion with a ?
speech, in which he insisted that the general rates t
of duties were too high, and the entire amount of a
revenue quite beyond what wan needed for the 12
present uses of the Government. There were few 1
free articles. The very necessaries of life?tea, i P
coffee, and salt?were to be heavily burdened; r
while the merest indulgences?gems, sweetmeats,
charts, philosophical apparatus, epaulets, sculp- ; a
turc, cabinets of coins, &,c.?were to be exempt , ?
from duty. I ^
Thus, then, those beverages which had become, I
to our laboring men as much the necessaries of v
life as bread is to the peasantry* of Europe, were j
to be heavily burdened I The very salt with which j 1
the poor man jjaved his bacon was to bear an im- '
post while the gems that glitter upon the persons ;
of the rich, the sweetmeats that load their luxurious
tables, come in free of duty. And hero Mr.
Allen " branched off considerably" (as they say t
in Virginia) into much eloquence about this tax- r
ing what the poor consume, and letting the rich 1
go free. f
Mr. Evans answered very briefly. Where (he j c
asked) did the Senator find in the bill that those j a
sparkling ornaments, of which he talked, were j j
free ? Gems?that is, precious stones?he would 1
find rated elsewhere in the bill at twenty per cent, s
The 44 gems" of which the Senator speaks are t
those comprehended in the expression, 44 cabinets ^
of gems"?that is, collections of engraved antique ji
stones: an object of curiosity and learned taste
only. Indeed, almost all the objects against the L
exemption of which from duties, he took such ex- r
ception, were aids and instruments of science or r
taste only; and had (Mr. E. might have added, t
we believe) been permitted in ail former tariffs to r
be imported without duty by corporations and f
sociitics of learning. ?. ^
But what sweetmeats did the Senator find let j
in duty free? None. They paid duty. The r
article which the Senator had mistaken for them t
was 44 West India fruits, ripe or green, in bulk." n
Mr. Allen was not at all convinced.' These a
gems were for the ri:h, the mon of taste, and for t
wealthy corporations; ana, t.iou<m tne r-wm- n
mc3fs proved ?o be b'lt fresh oranges, Icm^nr,
and the like, they were for the luxurious to feast
upon, or to make into punch.
Now, Mr. A. lorgot that, as a revenue question
merely, the duty which can be raised on fresh
oranges and lemons can hardly be any thing?
hardly worth the counting and measuring them;
and that it is scarcely just to subject to duties ar- i
tides like these, which rot almost before they can
be sold.
It is still worse as to the philosophical apparatus,
epaulets, sculpture, cabinets of curiosities, ?Scc.? |
things wanted for public purposes only?aids to j
great public objects of knowledge and the like; of '
which, moreover, the whole importation into the
United States, of such as will come duty free, |
wouifi prouauiy not pay any imng oui a very ui- ;
vial revenue.
Mr. Benton next introduced an amendment
taxing all bank notes and bills of exchange, and
subjecting them to a regular ulump duty: the of. |
ficers of all institutions that may issue any such !
paper without a stamp being punishable by fines, !
Si c.
Mr. Walker proposed a tax of twenty per cent.
on all plate or other household utensils of gold or
silver. His amendment provides that this tax
shall be collected, under the orders of the Secretary
of the Treasury, by the United States marshals;
who may depute for the purpose State sheriffs,
coroners, &.c. to act as collectors.
...
He reinforced this proposition with a statement i
of all the gold and silver upon the earth, according j
to Humboldt and others, The quantity he made '
imount to from four hundred and fifty to seven or j
eight thousand millions. (We arc not very sure '
if the sum ; but it is of 110 great matter, for no '
yucss can be more uncertain.) In this country
the estimated quantity of coin was about eighty
nillions. And all authorities on the subject agree
that the amount of the precious metals of a county
in the form of utensils and ornaments is cerain
to be twice as great as its coin: sa that this
:ountry probably contained one hundred and sixty
nillions of gold and silver, sequestrated from its
egitimate purpose of circulation by the pride of
he luxurious and rich. He stated the fact, delved
from Senator Smith, of Connecticut, that in
1 single bank one thousand dollars a week were
lsually drawn out in specie to be worked up into
date. And he reverted to the thirty thousand
lollars given, as a public compliment, to a ccleiratcd
financier, the late President of the United
5t itcs Bank.
lie further suggested that, after the adoption of i
his great measure here, our government should
>c directed to enter into negotiations with the
European Powers, to procure their co-operation in
his effort to reinfuso into the currency of the
vorld this life blood, exhausted from it by the dc- I
iletion o' individual extravagance.
[As Mr. Walker has directly and explicitly for.
>idd n us to nuke any comments upon what he
ays.. \vc arc fain to let all this pass, tempting as it
8.J
Mr. Evans said that this was :n reality laying
:n excise on gold and silver. It was a proposi.
ion to tax not what people consumed, or their in:omc,
but their actual property, at a rate of 20 per
:ent.; an enormity of taxation never heard of bc'ore.
It went, too, upon the idea that men were
.0 be stripped by peculiar taxes, for having a sur.
>lus which they dared to lay out in what they
iked. This, too, was a proposition coming from
he " largest liberty" party ! We were now to i
;o to all the matrons of the land, whose neat and j
irudent housewifery had made them mistresses of j
dozen silver spoons; and our marshals, sheriffs, i
r coroners were, after counting and weighing, to
akc one out of every five! Will you not, sir, in j
ivc years, leave the good old ladi s a spoon
o stir that tea and coffee of which we heard so j
ouch a few days since ? Then what is to become '
f their silver thimbles, and of the silver spec- <
icles which bestride the ancient noses of many of 1
Item ?
But, sir, surely, upon all the principles of this j
mendment, it ought to go much further. If1
keeping gold and silver out of circulation in this
arm be punishable by such taxes, so should be
he hoarding of it; and your collectors should be :
rdercd to drag from concealment those stock- i
tg's-full of coin?of which a Senator told us on a '
armcr occasion?count tlicm, and levy a toll of 20 i
er cent. ,
Mr. Walker now modified his amendment so (
a to apply the tax to all who had more than ?50 ;
rorth of gold or silver ware.
Mr. Simmons, who always sees things with the
ye of fact, here rose and suggested that this little '
latter offered one slight difficulty. The Senator !
rom Mississippi and his friends had all insisted :
hat we were, by this bill, about to collect too large '
. revenue. Now, as the Senator estimated the
I
;old and silver plate, dec. in the United States at
60 millions, he would perceive that a tax of 20
cr cent, on that would.add to the revenue just 32
nillions.
The question being then taken on Mr. W.'s
intendment, it was lost: 7 voting for it?Messrs. i
r 'I J 1
Ulcn, Fulton, Linn, Smith, Tappan, \\ alkcr, and
Vright?and 30 voting against it.
The amendments to the bill being gone through
vith, the vote was about to be taken on it, when
dr. Calhoun?desiring (he said) to speak against
t on its final passage?moved an adjournment. i

Washington, August 6.
The consequences of the veto of the Revenue
>ill are now the subject of attention. There was i
nuch apparent agitation at the Capitol to-day. ;
rhc members were every where gathered into
groups, talking, and sometimes witli much energy,
?n this subject. Some arc in favor of very prompt
md even rash proeeedingH?an immediate adoumment,
after denouncing Mr. Tyler, and mating
an issue with him before the people on this
ubject; 6ome few may be willing, as they 6ay
hey are, to im}>each him ; others again are in faror
of passing a new Revenue bill; and the ma.
ority arc undetermined what to do.
The democratic members, of late, have strongly
nsistcd upon the necessity of passing some Revclue
bill?of providing the necessary means of carying
on the government?and they now say that !
hey will not take the responsibility of an adjourn. |
nent befo-e some Revenue bill is enacted. If they i
houldvote against .in adjournment, there will be
vhigs enough in opposition to an adjournment to '
irevent it. Congress will then probably pass a '
?ew bill, framed in such a way as to conciliate !
he support of some ox' the democrats and meet the I
pprobation of the Executive. I doubt whether I
my bill that do-:s r.ot retain distribution can pass i
he Senate ; and am inclined to think that, if any |
till succeeds, it will be a twenty per cent. bill.

Wasamaroit, August 7. %
I leam that the veto message will certainly
in, on Tucsday. The whigs held another caucus,
last night, upon the subject of action after
the veto; but they came to no conclusion. The
opinion has been expressed, to-day, by some intelligent
and prominent whig members that they will
not consent to pass any new bill accommodated
to Mr. Tyler's views.
It is supposed that Mr. Tyler, in his veto message,
will intimate a willingness to sign any bill
not conflicting with the restrictive clause in the
A' .
uiamouiion act, at the tame time intimating that
the detail*, if found imperfect, can be perfpeUd
by subsequent legislation.
The question is, what sort of a bill will, pa*
The whigs can agree on no bill. The democrat!,
so fur as I learn, can agree on none. It is a sub.
jeet which the democratic party wish to avoid.
They will split upon it whenever they are obliged
to meet it. For instance, the Pennsylvania Sena,
tors, when it was proposed to amend the bill by
reducing the duties on iron, voted against the
amendment and actually prevented its adoption.
Many of the democratic party are willing to
take the tariff as it stood in 1840, including the
additional duties imposed by the law of last Sep.
teinber, an 1, perhaps, including also tea and cof.
fee. This wo aid suffer distribution to go on, and
still afford revenue. But all the friends of the protective
system will oppose this. Tbe idea of taking
Mr. Simmon's system of 25 per cent, duties
on an exorbitant valuation is abandoned. It is
uncertain whether any thing, and what will be
done.
The Senate?I omitted to mention, last night?
has agreed to a report of the Committee of Confercnce
on the Army Appropriation bill, and the
Army Organization bill.
It is proposed to strike out from the Army appropriutions
all provisions touching reorganization
and leave simply an appropriation bill.
The Organization bill is to be amended so as to
reduce the army in some respects as to numbers
and expenses. The number of men in each company
is to be reduced to 40. The 2d regiment of
dragoons is to be retained in the service, but, after
the 4th of March next, is to be converted into a
rifle regiment, for the protection of the Western
borders.
The House will probably concur in this report.
Cbngress is now ready to fix the 15th of this
month for adjournment, provided tlie Revenue bill
were to be approved. The struggle to pass anatlier
bill will prolong the session a week or two.
Whether a new bill is passed or not, it is certain
that there must be a new issue of Treasury note^
in order to enable the Government to go on, un'il
some funds accrue.

resolution was passed for giving to
the new members of the 27th Congress
the same books which have been giren to
members of the 26th Congress. Tbw

lars out of the Treasury.
The House again considered the bill to
provide for taking testimony in rases, of
contested election*, and for the organize

hers, &c , and it was finally passed. This
bill provides that the officers or board
ivhose duty it is under the Stst* hues .
determine who )a duly elected to Con.
gress shall make a return to the Clerk of
the House ditectly,and that the Clerk shall
put the member so returned and no ptfier
on his list, at the commencement of a
Congress. In case the State officers
neglect this return, the member elect may
himself bring it to the Clerk; but the .
Clerk can put no one on the list who is
not thus verified, and no person, not on
the list, can vote for Speaker, or pafiici- <
pale in the organization of the House.
The Clerk is directed to put no one on the
list who is not elected according to the
terms of the late apportionment law.
The hill also makes a rule in regard to
the fees, &c., paid to courts and witness,
es, and the payment of compensation to
the contesting and sitting members.
THE BOUNDARY AND A DINNER.
The Washington correspondent of the New York
Union says: I have met with a friend who has
wirnn m. miTKi nf>miint of thi> d nner. at the dwel.
?
ling of the Secretary of State, on Saturday, in
celebration of the settlement of the Northeastern
Boundary question. The President, the whole
Cibinet, Lord Athburton and suite, Mr. Fox and
suite, the Commifsioncrs from Maine and Massachusetts,
a few Senators and those of the gentlemen
engaged in the Northeastern Boundary sur.
vcys, then in the city, Major Graham and Captain
Talcot, made up the company. The most harmo- '
nious and peaceful spirit prevailed. Mr. Webster
gave a toast; " Queen Victoria! long may she
continue to reign over a prosperous and happy
people." Lord Ashburton gave, u The President!"
perpetuity to the institut.'om of the United States."
The President gave, "The Commissioners!
blessed arc the peacemakers." Mr. Lawronbe
gave, " Ix>rd Ashburton, who has always manifested
the most friendly bentiments towards the
United States." Lord Ashburton said in reply,
" That at his time of life nothing, certainly, but m
strong regard for his kinsman on this side of the
Atlantic, a desire to see removed all causes of dispute
between them and his- countrymen at home,
so that nothing might remain to interrupt tbs
friendly regard, and a confidence that a settlement
might be made of all thoee controversies which
every honest man in either oountry would approve,
could have induced him to undertake such a voyage
and such a task."
The Secretary of War was then toasted with
some pleasant allusions to his business being spoiled
by the commissioners, itc. .
