in mind the cliarge'of:'the Apostle to Timothy,
under the rnost solemn zanc'tions, to "'preach
the word," It not onlybecomes the duty of the,
;ministry faithfully to declare the truth as.it is
in Jesus, that-they may be " pure from'the
blood of all men;''-but also.ai a means by
which they may indhce those under their charge
to make that word the rule6ftheir lifeE To
produce this result, we observe,
3. That the message.of salvation should be
proclaimed in thespirit ofits author. Rom.
viii. 9. "If any man. have not the spirit of
Christ he isinoheeof his."- He is not qualified
o be Christ's in any respect unless he be un
er theinfluence-of.a'like holy disposition; and
cannot be prepared, therefore, to proclaim his
gospel successfully -to others. The truth may
be delivered in-such a manner as not only to
fail in producing a good effect; but of steeling
the mind against. its- reception. This arises
not so much from the language in which it is
delivered as the spirit. The truth, though ne-.
cessary to be taught, must be spoken in.love.
Eph. iv. 15. But Speaking the truth .in lot's,
ay gro* up into him in all things, which is
the head, Christ." -Love to God and mail is
the foundation of every qualifieation of the
servant of Christ. See i Cor. chap.xiii. par
ticular verses 1-8. Wauld" Ministraiinduce
their charge to practicethe precepts of the Bi
ble, let themtake heed to the spirit in which
those precepts are taught."..
4. Ministers should be living exemplifica
ons of the precepts they teach. Rom. ii. 21.
' Thou, therefore, which teachest another,
teachest thou not thyself? thou, that preachest
a man should not steal, dost .thou steal? 23.
Thou that makest thy-boast ot' the law, through
breaking the law dishonorest thou God Y" It
has been said of Ministers, that they were as
posts on the wayside, which,-without walking
in the way of their. own direction. pointed the
traveller to the path which leads to the desired
goal. The truth or falsehood of this charge will
not be fully unfolded till the day in which Jesus
Christ shall judge-thesecrets of all hearts:
Yet of this may the-ministey rest assured, that
they will not prove as successful in influencing
men to walk in the way of holmes as the index
on the way tide, unless they lead in the way.
Do the ministry preach against worldly mind.
edness. and are they conformed to the world ?
Do they teach others to love their enemies,
and do they bear malice? Do they inculcate
principles of benevolence, and are they of a
contracted and illiberal pirit ? Alas ! there may
be some few individuals among their ranks of
this stamp, but we trust "they are but few and
far between." It may be said ofsome 'fthem
however, with some show of propriety, "Phy
sician heal thyself." 2. Tim. ii. 4. "No man
that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs
of this life; that he may please him who bath
chosen him to bea soldier." Yet one has gone
to his merchandise, another to his farm, another
to his school-room, -while but few remain con
stantly at their posts on the walls of Zion to
cry aloud and spare not. But in reply may
such not say, I. Cor. ix.7. "Who goeth a
- ivarfare at any time at liis own charges ? Who
planteth a vineyard, -and enteth not the fruit
thereof? or *ho feedeth a flock, and eateth
not of the milk- thereof?" ver. 14. " Even so
hath the Lord ordaiudithattthev which preach
the gospelshali livei6f the gospel " Ministers
are men of like wants with other men, and have
those for whom theymust provide. If they
make not this provisionthey will have denied
the faith and acted worse than infidels. They
are not mirdedlously supplied, neither has
God promised 'miraculously to supply them
with food from heaven, and garments that wax
not old, but while they are commanded to at
tend to the spiritual interests of the Church,
the Church is under equally strong obligations
to provide for their temporal wants.
5. Ministers should he men of prayer. The
prayer .of faith claims the promises of God,
whichcannot fail. -Let Ministers water their
labours with much fervent prayer, and in due
seasonathey shall reap if they faint niot. James
v. 16. ' The effectual fervent prayer of a right
eous maa avamtleth much." Matt. xxi.22. "And
all tlimgswhatsoever ye shall ask in prayer,
believing, ye shall i-eceive."
6. They should rely alone upon the power of
God to effect' the -work. John xv. 5. "For
wvithout me ye can d<, nothing saithi Christ.
Their let Minmsters make themselves thorough.
ly acquainted, with the oracles of truth: let
them faithfully proclaim iin the spirit of love
that truth and practice it; *'Let them weep
between the porch and the altar,' and go in the
strength of the Lord God; then will their
flocks learn to prize more fully the scriptures
of truth, make them more conscientionsly and
effectively the rule of their life, aud be more
exemplary and zealous in the cause of.God.
--Then shall Zion arise and shine in the glory
of him who rises upon her, looking forth as the
mnornr, fair as the moonm, clear as the sun, and

07T We return our thanks to the editor of
the Anderson Gazette, for inserting our Adver
tisement in his valuable Journal. We little
thought, at the time we pitt forth that niotice,
thrit every editor, wvho was friendly to sustain
ing the good standing of the Art, would. upon
publishing it, receive- a volley of abuse, from
one, whom we have found out to be divested
*of any pretensbons to common decency or civil
ity, and wvho has always. sinice lie has been
knotvn to thme profession, been a complete beg
gar for ,favors from the craft, and woeathereock
to all parties. We had a hope, that the editor
of the Gazette would have treated him with si
lent contempt, as we ought to have done long
since. he editor of the Gazette, in the follow
ing has given him his just deserts, and we have
no hesitation in endorsing the remarks as true
to the letter,.

-Hamburg Journal-The Editor of the

torioty, and when his tergivereations in,
polities, by the most barefaced abandon
ment of principles, have failed in creating
a sensation with the presses of the country,:
he resorts to Yliohopeless game, of picking
Editorial quarrels and 'controversies with
his brethren of! the corps. Well, if he

press has satisfied us that -if any class of
mechanics earn hardly their sustenance
they are urintera. We think their:prices
are moderate, and are not disposed to.lend
our aid in docking their-wages.
If the Journal has represented truly, the
increase of his subscription list since his
wonderful conversion to whiggery, he has
but little excuse for soliciting [or begging?]
advertisements at half price, we opine
that his new allies in accordance with
their, established usage will pay hiim in
promises. A few months will satisfy him of
their intriasic value-especially if these
promises are drawn upon and dishonored,
at as early a date as some of the like des
cription were after the cider campaign of
'40. ' An editor, however lean, lank and
hungry he may look, must have a more
substantial diet than mere promises. It is
hard indeed that this wonderful apostle of
Whiggery should he driven to the dire ne
cessity of petitioning for advertising, at
half prices, to-afford that support which
his new and delighted allies refuse to
give him. Does.tho editor suspect noth
ing from this fact? His brethren are in
doubt whether he will stick to them
through the campaign, and we should not
be at all surprised to learn at any time
that he had become a "ranting loco-foco."
We ask the editor, seriously, what cause
he has to complain at us? It has not been
more than 3 months since we copied,
without charge of course, the Prospectus
of the Fifth Volume of the Journal four
times, although our political principles
were totally at variance with his, and
nearly half a column of our paper was
taken up with the prospectus.-Were we
-under any obligations to him before that
time? What right then has he to com
plain at our copying the advertisement of
of the Advortiser? The Editor of the
Advertiser kindly copied our Prospectus
at the commencement ofour Volume, and
has since then extended us every courtesy
in his power. We returu him our thanks
for it, and gladly embraced the opportu
nity of repaying his favors in publishing
of his advertisement to continue business
at the regularly established rates.
If the editor of the Journal had made
a respectful request of us to publish his
half fee advertisement we would have
complied with it most cheerfully. If we
publish it now it will be charged as an
advertisement.
The Augusta W1ashingtonian.-We with plea
sure announce the receipt of the first number
of the third volume of this valiable Temper
ance. Journal, and hope that the friends-of this
good cause will step forward and give it that
support it so justly deserves. We adyise the
friends of Temperance to give the following
remarks, giving their views and intentions, :a
careful perusal: -
Front the Agusta Washingtonian.
To ALL whoa IT MAY coCCa--We
to-day make a new bow to our readers,
and after a brief suspension of our weekly
salutations, extend to them the cordial
hand. When we last addressed you, the
prospect for the renewal of our acqu'ain
tance was not very encouraging. But
owing to strenuons exertions of. a. few
friends; our list has reached that number,
which warrants us in again issuing our
sheet. In appearing before you 'at the
commencement of a new volume,'it may
be proper to premise a few remarks-first,
as to what we expect from you.
Our object, then, you will understand,
is to advance the great lemperance refor
mation. It will be our aim to present
such statements and arguments as may be
interesting to the friends of the cause an
the one hand, anti as may operate benefi
cially upon those who are still in danger
from the intoxicating bowl.-Whilst this
shall be the leaditng design of our paper,
we also" hope to pay some attention .to
inalters of a misellaneous character. It
will be our purpose to furnish that.variety
which shall make the Washingtriian .a
welcome visitor to the family circle, and
which shall minister to the gratificationof
different tastes. -We profess no polities.
In the discharge of our duty, we know
neither Clay nor Frolinghuyson, Pol1k
nor Dallas. Whenever wve catn, we shall
applaud either party ; whenever we: must;
we shall condemn either. We prefer no
sectarianism; but we trust that we shall
ever be found supporting, to the heat of
our ability, the interests of true religion.
Our aim, in short, will be to entertain,
instruct, and profit all who may favor its
with their patronage.
Of our readers we have a very small
request to make. It is that they bear
with our infirmities, and throw the matntle
of charit y over ouir errors. It was a source
of regret that any one's feelitnes should
have' been wounded by articles wvhich ap
peared in our former volume. Nothing
cari be further from the intention of any
one who writes for this paper .than wound
a friend of the .cause.. -If we have .ap
peered severe, or if at any. future otime we
we may seem - harsh, let it be borne in
mind -that our seeming' sevet ities are -the
efforts of a love eager to -resce.-It-is
bard to desist from saying some sharpi
things whin we behold the wiles of the
Tempter for the destruction of virtue and
innocence. .We aim to hit bad principles,
not bad men. We would destroy the poi
son-at thessame -time-we would imjure
neither the hand that supplies it, or the
baud that receives it. -.
Such are our. piomises, and such our
expectations. Let both then be realized,
and at the close of. the year we -will -not
regret having labored for you, nior will
you regret having purchased and read the
third Vol. of the Washingtonian. --

Government Deposilcs.-The amount of
funds of the Government of the United
States in deposite in four weeks in the
city of New York on the 1st instant, viz:
the Bank ofCommerce, Bank ofAmerica,
Merchants and American Exchange, was
$4,383,000 and in Albany $94,000.
The U. S. Treasury.-A Washington
correspondent ofrthe Philadelphia Mercu
ry says: "Ilearned to-day that the receipts
at the Treasury Department exhibit a
degree of prosperity in the finances of the
Government almost beyond parallel. Fur
the iast four or five years the weekly re
ceipts-rarely exceeded $250,000 whereas
they now seldom fall below $900,000, and
at :imes exceed a million!"
The Crops, and the Damage by Floods.
-In speaking of the, crops, and the dam
age which has been -sustained by the re
cent disastrous floods, the editor of the
Vicksburg Constitutional says:
"In the interior the crops are generally
good; in -all the valley regions they are
seriously injured or totally destroyed, and
there are but few :plantations indeed en-.
tirely exempt from injury -by the flood.
Where the levees were unbroken, the
hack water has destroyed from -one-fourth
to three-fourths of the hopes and pros
pects. We have, not heard of any planta
tion on the rivers or bayous for many
miles above and.below as wholly free from
damage.. Some estimates have been at
tempted of the destruction. None can he
made with anything like certainty;. but
twenty millions of dollars would assured
ly not cover the loss of property and crops,
from the falls'ofthe Missouri to the Gulf.
Some well informed person, who have
seen much of the. ruins, do not .hesitate to
name a much larger sum, and the work
of desolation is yet going on. The water
here has fallen very little. The last re
ported rise above has not reached us."
The same editor says that -he has seen
several estimates of the destruction of the
cot ton crop in all the submerged country.
The general belief is that it will be 450,000
bales, or nearly one-fifth' of the whole. crop
of the U.States.
Overflow at Bayou Sara.-The Bayou
Sara Ledger of Saturday last says that
.'Our . town ivith the exception, of the

have already left their dwellings. and oth

thie'prospect is .uocomfortableeiough, for,

Loka This.--\e have always said
that the spirit of "Naiive Americanism,"

most conclusive that the declaration is
true to the letter- The evidence is such
as will commend itself to every 'patriot,
every man who believes in the doctrine of
the immortal Declaratiotn of Indepen
dence. After promising in the following
(quotation,
"Trhat the history of the present King
of Great Britais- is, a history of repeated
injuries and usurpations, all having. in di

The Declaration goes on to assign a series
of facts to juistify a earation from the

ject of regenerating grace during the protract
ed meeting held with the Baptist Churcifin this

To those Candid lMen
WHO honestly doubt the truth of the Bran
drethian System, we would entreat
them to ponder well upou the following facts:
The F'ood taken into the stomach is conivert
ed into blood, which vital stream, flowing
through all the rainifications of the system, not
only imparts strength and 'continues life, but
actually creates, forms, and builds up. each and
every part of the animal machine. If the blood
therefore, is pure and healthy, the body, which,
is formed from, and supported by the blood,
cannot be diseased. Bitt it'there be in. any p art
of the body any efreetion, such as bile, or ulccr,
even a bruise, the blood circulating through
that part, takes up impure matters from the 1to
cal affection. andre~arries it into the general sys
tem. This is the cause olleni of sudden death
to persons of full habit, afflicted with biles, and
use no medicine ; the matter gets into the cir
cmlating system, and chokes up the fine blood
vessels which supply the brain with vitality,
and life ceases, as if bereft by lightning. Nuw
this can.be remedied-the Brandr-eth Pills, will,
if used at these tines, take out all impure mat
ters from the circulation, and save the general
health. at-the same time they are curing the lo
cal affection. Oh! how' important itis to man
kind, that this subject be well comprehended;
it n ould'save mainy from tedious times of sick
ness, and often secure their services to their
friends, when otherwise the tomb would hamve
its victim.;
