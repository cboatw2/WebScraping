A MARRIAGE QUESTION.
i Speech of ilio K rv. Dr. Hodgo of Princwlon. in !
j iho tii:iv?ral As'tomMy of the Presbyterian
Cliutclt at its 1 alo meeting in Pli.l idolphia,
j on the case of the ICv. Archibald .McQueen,
| who had appealed tc that body from the scnj
tcic^ of tiie Presbytery of Fayetlcvillc, ?ur- I
I pending hint from lite ministry and from the
J communion of the church, for marrying the
fcistcrof hi. docoHind uil'n.
i '1 be Rev. Dr. Hodge said (hat the first
j question to he considered in reference to
the case now before us, is, whether there
i is anv divine law againt incest ?
, . 15
It has been argued, bore and elsewhere,
that, as far as the word of God is con
eerned, there is no such ofV'-nco as that
j charged against the appellant. It is said
that God instituted marriage, but left to
' the decision of the civil power, the specification
of the degrees of kindred within
1 which it ought out to he contracted.?
This of course supposes that the law in i
1 I oi* if i/*ii43 lino riA rofortiMpo In imrrmrrA I
B:jt to this view of the subject there arc j
; the slrtrjn?<^ .objections,
] In tlit; first place, it is in the highest (
degree improbable that the law of (Joel, ]
I which is so comprehensive in its princi- j
pics, and so minute in its details, which j
( lias so many precepts relating to marriage, j
. should leave a subject so important to the j
'p ace and purity of society untouched j
j There is probably no man upon I his floor j
I who could bring himself to believe that a j
! marriage between a brother and sister ;
would not be a violation of the divine !
law.
This view moreover is contradicted by ;
; the express language of the liible. "None j
of you shall approach unto any that is j
sacrifices, oblations, &c. F?ut besides j
these, there are laws founded upon Ih constitution
of things, tlwt is, upon the
nature of man and tlie permanent rela.
tions rf society as constituted by (iod.
Such is the command. Thou shall not
steal. Theft supposes property, and
therefore where there is no property
there can he no theft. To this class belongs
also the whole law of marriage.
The relation of the sexes might not have
existed; or it might have existed dideren
lly; l?ut it does exist, the duties resultiiig
from it have a foundation permanent
as the ielation itself.
Tho laws now in question, it is admitted,
are not moral in the sense in winch
the command to love God is a moral coininnnd;
but neither arc they merely positive,
founded upon peculiar and temporary
circumstances. They are to be re- j
gnrded as expressions of the divine will in j
reference to duties arising out of the per- j
rnnnent relations of men.
If what has been said is correct, it fol- \
lows that these laws, though permanent,,
are not absolutely immutable. There
can he no exception to the command.
Thou shaft love the Lord thy God with
all thv heart; hut there are many exceptions
to the command, Thou shall not kill.
Though we are forbidden to appropriate,
to ourselves the property of others without
their consent, yet there are circumstances,
in which this may lawfully he!
done. Though the Jews were forbidden
to la Lour on the Sabbath, yet we know,
that in many cases labour on that day i
was a duty. The fact, therefore, that |
the immediate children of Adam intermar- j
ricd, is no proof that brother may now j
marry their sisters without, violating any
law of God. Nor is the fact that under
peculiar circumsta ices, and for specified!
reasons, as a brother was commanded to
marry the widow of his deceased brother,
any proof that in ordinary circumstances,
such a connexion is i:i accordance with
the divine will.
Hut h file Javv, ;n the form in which it
is presented in the lSlh of Leviticus,
still binding upon us?
Tho answer to this question is included ;
in what has already boon said. It is the'
expression of the wiil of God as to what is
right, not in the temporary and peculiar i
circumstances of the Hebrews, but in the
permanent relations of society. It does,
I not say that a Hebrew father must no*,
j for peculiar reasons, marry his daughter;
I or that a Ifebrew brother must not, for
peculiar reasons, marry bis sister. Iv.it
it speaks of fathers, brothers, nephews.
See., as such. This is the principle,
! u hich. hv common consent, is adopted in
! interpreting I lie laws of the Old 'IVsta
I ment. Those which were merely typical
I or ceremonial, or which related to the peculiarities
of the former dispensation, are
either repealed by the express authority
of Christ, or expired by their own limitation.
But those which declare the duties
men as men, of fathers as fathers, of brothers
as brothers must, continue as long as i
j the relations on which they are founded j
! continue. Our only rule of duty is i'iu will j
I of God; and it matters not how n<?r when j
; that vull was expressed. If God has said |
j brothers and sisters ought not to inter
| marry, it is a law for all brothers, and all
sisters, wherever or whenever they may
live. And this is the more evident, if the
reason assigned for the prohibition is |
nothing, in the pocurlror circmrs'nnci s of
certain brothers and sisters, but the simple
fact that they are brothers and sisters.
The law itself moreover contains evidence
that it was not intended to apply to
nnv one people, or to anyone time. This
evidence consists partly in the fact already
referred to, that the grounds of the
prohibition arc not peculiar and temporary,
but general and permanent, and partly in
the faelthad the heathen are said to he,
subject to the judgments of God fur the
very things here prohibited. The 18th
chapter of Leviticus prohibits marriage
between near relatives, and several other
evils, and concludes with the declaration
that for these things the heathen were
punished.
We have also the authority of the New
Testament, in support of the continual j
obligation of this portion of the L'vitical j
law. The manner in which the apostle 1
speaks in 1 Cor. 5, shows that he rega do I
the offence there referred tonsn violation !
of a law still in force. And that law j
could not be that which forbids adultery,
for he savs the offence in question was
unheard of oven among the Gentiles. ,
There is no express re-enactment of the
original law of marriage in the New Tes
lament. It is no where expressly said .
th it marriage must he between one man 1
and one woman,'but the continued obli- (
gation of the original law, implied in the (
creation of one woman for one man, is ^
silently taken for granted. In like man- (
ner, there is no assertion in the New Testament,
that near connexions must not .
intermarry; we find the wnlnw fulness of *
such marriages assumed. And hence :
wherever (he Uible has gone, it has car- ,
ried w ith it the conviction that polygamy t
ind incest are contrary to the will of j
Sod. I ^
Again, if wc say that the Lcvitical law j t
if marriage is no longer binding, we are |,
C ~ D * J (J
Iriven to the position that we have no di,ino
law upon the subject, and that the , t
ntcrmarrving of the nearest blood rcla- I'
ions is merely an off* nee against the civil I "
aw. This is a conclusion which the ?
Christian community cannot be prevailed f,
ipon to adopt. tl
Hut the question more immediately be h
ore this Assembly is, whether the rnar- {iage
of a man with the sister of his ?
leceased w ifo, is prohibited ? ti
As far as our Confession of Faith is t!
ii..? i ?i . -- .1 . ?i
.milium, lutu; is miuuuim on irns pnint. ^
The mar, inny not mar.? any of his tt
wife's kindred nearer in blood than he! ?
nay of his own." But the qlestion has 11
>een aske d,
lion, and are called upon not to make
laws, but to administer thorn, there would
seem to be no room fur such a question.
SurelvMhe court* of the cht.r l? yre bound

over, l>e said, that neithi r our ministers nor
! our church courts are bound hv everv inin1
uteinjuiuttioii or declaration of the L'onfes[sion.
Rut the section in question is not a
; matter of small importance. It is an es.
sential principle of that part of our svstern
'of doctrine which relates to marriage.
(Nor !?as this part of our constitution be.
| come obsolete. Cases have, e?cry few
i years, been brought up for adjudication
under this very rule, and no instance has
been produced in which the General As.
senibly has felt at liberty to remove the
censure inflicted by the inferior judicator.
ies for the violation of the rule. As it regurds
the present appellant, the ease is
peculiarly strong. Some years since, an
appeal was brought by an elder, in bis
own section of the church from a decision
of a session excommunicating him for
marrying tho sister of his deceased wife,
and the General Assembly of 1826 decided
they could giyo hint no relief, ho long
an the pr"scnt rule remained in our Book.
And when, agreeably to the decision of
th.nt Assembly, the question was submit,
ted to the Presbyteries, whether our constitution
should be altered njs to thispoint,
only eighteen out of the whole number
voted in the affirmative. Mr. McQueen
therefore contracted this marriage, knowing
the provisions of the constitution on
the subject; knowing the sentiments of
the brethren of his .own Presbytery
knowing that the Assembly left bound by
the canon so long as it remained unrepealed;
ami knowing also that the Presbyteries
had decided that it should not be
stricken from tho Book. Considered,
thorcfoic, as a more matter of occlesiastical
discipline, it is bard to conceive of a
case in which a court could be more completely
shut up to one decision.
But, after ail, as our Confession has
j no power to bi..d the conscience, as it
cannot make thai to he sin which God
! has not declared to be sin, the main quesI
tio u i-'f whether the marriage under con'
o
siderution is forbid Jen by the word of
God7
I Assuming now that v. chap. \v;iii.

cisinn of the question just proposed de.

persons who must not intermarry, so that

: it is expressly forbidden (hat a woman

p.e^'y for i I |.,m that a m in should ui-irry
two si ders. 1) it if the law is to be
understood as specifying the degrees of
rclation-diip within which iimiriagcshould
not !?e contracted, then the marriage tin.
\
der consideration is forbidden. II ??w
t! c i are we to determine what rule of
interpretation ought to lie nth n nd? Not
by authority, noi by argument, hut by
ii.spceting tlie law itself. What does it
mean? What does the D.vi ;c Liwgiver
intend to prohibit? 1 iiat the law must
bo understood of decrees appears Iroin
t!ic following consider.itions.
First, tin; command is 4' No te of yen
shall approach to any who is
near ofkin to him." Tl?i> is a general
prohibition of marriage between near kindred.
AH th.it follows is hot amplification
and application of thi* general role,
showing what degrees of nearness of kin
constitute a bar to inariiagc. A id thai
affinity as well as consanguinity, is inrlu
ded in this general prohibition, is evident
because of the .specifications whicn fob
low, the great majority refer to relation
ship by affinity.
Again, when wo come t*> look at the
particular prohibtions we find the degree
of kindred specified as the verv ground
of the command, and that too both in cases
of affinity and ronsnnguini y. Thus
it is said, verse J.!, that a man shall not
marry the daughter of his father or of iiis
mother, because she is his sister. The
reason given in verses 12, 13 why n man
shall not marry his aunt is, that she is
the ?ister of his fi.t'icr or in ?thcr. Tin*
ronton why marriage with a brother's wife
is Iorl)i<1 den, is her relationship to the
bro her: and in verse 17. it U said, a
man shall not marry the daughter or
grand daughter of his wife, 44 for they
ire her near kinswomen: it is wicked- j
ne.ss." That is, the fact that they are j
die kinswomen of his wife is the reason of j
ihc prohibition. Tnis passage seems ,
ilainly to ftnch that it is wicked to marry J
he near kindred ofa wife.
i ho law itself, therefore, both in its '(
general statement, and in its particular j j
ipecifications, gives the rule ??1 its own
nteprelation. it is the degree of kin
ired which the law itself savs is to he t
ronstdcrcd. If this be so, then the law a
brhids the marriage of a man with the * l
ister of his deceased wife, in forbidding
he marriage of a woman with brother |
if a deceased husband.
