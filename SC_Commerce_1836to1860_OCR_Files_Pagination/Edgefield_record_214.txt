COMMERCIAL CONVENTION.
AUGUSTA, Oct. 17.
The Convention met at 1 o'clock, in.
stead of 12, as the committee of 21 were
not ready to report at that hour.
At the request of the President. the dele
Pates who had arrived since the last ad
Journmeut, came forward and registered
their names.
The Secretary the", read ithe minutes of
the last meeting, which were confirmed.
James G. Holmes, Esq. of Charieston,
then rose and stated to the Conventio'n that
the committee appointed yesterday to re
eeive subscriptions from the membmers for
the purpose of procuring a Silver Cup, to
be presented to Wmn. Dearing, Esq. of Ath
ens. had discharged that duty, and he hoped
the Chairman of that committee woul be
allowed to present the same; which was
granted. This ceremony produced quite a
sensasion in the Convention-E. Bellinger,
Esq. the Chairman of the committe, came
forward, in behalf of the Covention, and
after one of the most feeling addresses we
have heard for some time, presented the
Cup to Mr. Dearing-concluding his ad
dress with the hope that he might long
live to enjoy the reputation of being the
"first one who proposed the Commercial
Convention, and ono whom we claim. not so
--much the son of Georgia as of the South'"
that this Convention might he the means of
adding the happiest results to the prosperi
ty of the Southmand that he would esteem
the gift, not so much for its value,iut asthe
best legacy he could leave his children, to
emulate them to follow his worthy example
in behalf of the commerce of the South.
Mr. Dearing rose, mch excited, and
returned his thanks to the Convention and
the Committee, for the honor done him-it
was more than lie merited-hut if what
little lie had been instrumental in doing,
should result to the benefit of the South
and Southern commerce, so long as his life
was spared. exertion on his part should not
be wanting to place it on a sure and perma
nent foundation.
On motion of Ker Boyce, it was then
Resolved, That the Pr'esident and Vice
Presidents of this Convention he permitted
to take part in the discussions.
Judge Longstreet, chairman of the com
mittee of 21, then rose and read the Re

ties of intercommunication by Rail Roads
and Canals, between the interior Western
undjSouthm.Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico
States,are among tie most important meas
utsof restoring to the Commercial Ports
of the latter, the direct trade which has so
recently departed from them.
3. Resolved, therefore, That while it is
strongly recommended by this Convention,
to the dilferent States to afford every possi
ble aid to approved works of internal im
provement, having the above objects in view
it is equally obligatory on the companies or
corporations chartered for said objects, to
consider their works as but parts of one
great design, and so harmonize and co-ope
rate in their operations as to produce through
those great arteries and eeins of the com
mercial body, a circulation, as pet-feet as
that which tnourishes and animates the hu
man system.
4. Resolved, That the Banking institi
tions of the respective States in which they
are located, catinnot moree surely advnmce
their own imnterests. in connectioni with time

Chmarleston and Cimncinnati Ramil Roads,
have been most clearly deimnstrated in
the successful progress of those great works

Till-' IRECT TlRA1DE.
We have d welt on the necessary agency
of the Btanks in the prlmotuotiin of a direct
intercourse with Eurole--lat, in enabling
our icrebantst.I. to purchase in Europe, by
metans of letters of credit, and 2nd, to sell
on extended credit in tle U. States by the
discounn of lon, paper. The Bank of
Charleston has holdly led the way in eff'eet
inc the first object. That institution grants
lets. rs of credit lir the moderate charge of
I percent, which is not above as reasonnhle
gusarautce furenIdorsing 'he credit of liries.
It now remains for the other istitutions
of le city. in couLnexion with the Rail Roid
Bank, to perform their part, hv discount
ing- the paper receiving by our wholesale
mnerchants hom their country eustoners.
Withaut the due combination of the-e two
elentents of credit, it is unnvailiug so enter
into competition with the New York im
porters.
Next in importance to these means is the
establishment of linres or Packets whether
by Steam or Satilin Veels, so as to in
sure regularity of cottimunication Thi, is
a necessary ingredient in tiny scheme for
the recovery of the )iret't Trade. The
object of profit should toit lie sought, and.
if necessary, it should he sacrificed, at the
outset, to establish a regularity of commu
tication by a line of sailing or steam pack
ets. Let th ie mierelhants of Charleston and
Sayannah commtuenee tla work, by showing
a disposition to subscribe liberally towards
it thetmselves, and inviting co-operation
frot public spirited smiivid uals, in the in
terior towns, so as to acquire fonds for a pur
pose which is intinaely blended with any
well cosidered plan of Direct Trade. Un
comtutmed capital and individunal enterprse
are inadeqluate to this ohj. cs. I requires
coimbimatiui of tionied meuis.
As part of she plan, les agenss be sent to
tillereut paris of Enrope, with which it
would be advanutageos to establish a direct

INTmcays-rtNu NantarivE.-Aimong the
ves-els lost on the Florid.a riee dursng the
memorable gale of the 7 th and 0th Sept.
lust. our readers may remember the brig
Olney. Cap.. homas. This vessel,whictm
hai left St. Jago de Cuba .r few days pore
vious with a cargo composed ol a uillhou
of eigams, a quantity of tobacco, and a large
number ofecedar logs, was wrecked on Fe I
duy, the 7th Sept. about l miiles to tihe
north of cape Florida. She had attempted
to an. hor, but the tempiest was so viole t
that both her anchors sn.apped like puck
thread, and she wasdraven high and dry on
the Florida shore. The 'persoas on boart,
c.mpamrisiug the crew 0l sesen len. and a
single passenger, remained in the' brig in
thie contaml expectation that the wreekess
in the ,neighborhood would come to their re
lief- iwo days after the Oluey had gone
ashore, while the captain and crew were at
breakimst, the report of rifles was heard.
Every one rejoiced in the belief that asist
'alce was at hand. On ascending the deck
what were the sum prise and horror of these
poor fellows, at beholding the brig in posses
sion of some twenty ferocious and well -an
ed Indians, who had collected on the star
hoard quarters, and who menaced them
wimh immmaediale death in case of the slight
est rsisance. The crew were totally us
armed. and implicit obedience to mime mer
ciless savages constituted their sole chance
of ultimate safety.
'hey were ordered by signe to remove
the eigars from the hold and throw them on
the beach. About one hundred im .if boxes
had been removed, when captain Thomnas,
a hoIild ami irritable man. refused unecoudi
tionally to throw away any mcv' of his
cargo. One of the savages, enraged at his
disobedience, knocked him down with the
butt end of his rifle. This was the signal
of attack, a volley of imilets was immaedi
aely dis'harged at the unfortunate com
manudr, and having been pierced by two
rifle halls, he was hurled yet l.reahiing on
the beach. One of the wretches lerceiv
ing that he still lived, seized the hatch bar
mand plunged it into his breast, extinguish
Snig every remnant of life. The crew were
then comnanded to go ashore. Seacely
had they touched the land, whea a second
dise;m'ge of rifles was made, by which five
were killed. Of the remaining two, one
who had escaped unwounded, fled so fast
that the Indians were unable to overtake
hin,. 'I'ihe otiher, Johnson by name, sprang
towards some low bushes which grew at a
short distance. and having heard that green
branches were considered by the savage as
a miken, of peace, lortunately bethought him
sell of maksng an eftort to have his life
spared. lie plucked one of the bushes from
the ground, fell on his knees, and held it up
with signs of sulpplication. The savages
understoud the appeal. and hme ways fiur a too
meat sufe. T'hey gave him an axe, and
poimig to a smark which was lying at
soume dmstan'e on the shoreutomn upmward-.,
lie was commamnded into it. Ile obeyed, and
i'the Indians atok ia quantity of heef out of it
which they mamde himn carry to their en
campmment, w hich w as some miles from
the spot. Having arrived there, it ap
pearetl the savages had only postponed the
deat h of the poor fellow, for several of them
levelled their rifles at him, and were about
to fire, when a squan rushed out of a wig
wuam, placed herself hefore him, and inter
*.ded a"tpiw..-.fu4y -se his iit, that the
indians left him unharmed, and entered
their temis.
As soon as Johnson found himself unoh
served, he started with all speed which tihe
love of life coild infuse in his frame, and
-iomn reached the brig, lie ascended her
sides, ani stioed himself among a nimber
f cedar blocks which were on the deck.
