Rave been used instead of the word "simi n
lar." It seemed probable that they bad o
reference to the ordinary post coach transportation
in the same section of country, ti
and to the points of similarity between that ii
and railroad transportation, intending the
additional 25 per cent, as compensation for t
tho increased speed. This construction f
would have given the rail road companies J
as liberal a compensation as they had a
right to except, inasmuch as it wouli have i
materially increased the eost of mail trans- '<
portation, while in respect to passengers, 1
produce nd merchandise, the cost is every f
cheanened by them. I
But upon a careful consideration of tha 1 v
words of t!ie law, in connection with the
mail service existing at trie time 01 us pas- i
?age, the department felt itself constrained I
to adopt a construction more favorably to r
the rail road companies. That the word t
"similar" should be construed as having no t
reference to speed, was a position which,; t
according to legal as weil as just rules of j s
construction, could not be maintained.? 1
From New York to Baltimore, the great i
Southern and Western roads are united in I
one. At the latter point they separate, one
portion, believed to be the larger, going I
West, and the other South. It could not be
doubled that the transportation of the Wes. '!
tern mail was, in its bull:, its jveight, its int.'
portance, and also its speed, more "similar" j
to that on the main Southern line, than any '
other appertaining to the department. The j 1
department, therefore, felt constrained to j I
? ?!/?, ;.? ihai trensnortntion as its i
l'iv vwk *y? ? ? -j- ? j
guide in fixing on the basis for the allow. 11
ance to railroad companies on the main f'
Southern line, provided for by low. The :
overage cost of this line, from Baltimore ,
to Cincinnati, was fouud to be $190 per j t
mile. To this sum, 25 per cent, was ad- i
ded, and the aggregate, 8237 50, was of.
fered to the railroad companies between
Fredersburg. Va. and the Roanoke river,
rs the highest compensation which could be
allowed them by law. The same rule was !
intended to be applied to all railroads under i1
like circumstances. It was not doubted i!
that this provision would be readily acccp.
ted as more ample than the railroad companies
had a right to expect, and that this j1
troublesome matter would have been for. i i
ever adjusted, so far as regards those roads. 1 '>
But the proposal of the department has not i
been a ceded :o, and not only is a higher '
compensation demanded, but conditions are <
insisted on as extraordinary as the conces ?
sion of them would be impolite and illegal. <
The department is, therefore, engaged in ;
making provision for the transportation of j 1
\tr of linr monnn ' 5

the 1st of January next, not being at: J
liberty under the law even if it were otherWise
diapersed, to accede to the terms do- '
manded by the railroad companies. This s
cannot be done on the same line without s
public inconvenience in the loss of time, and
although a rival line may be raised up in the !1
couise of a few menlhs fully equal in speed,! >
yet it will not be so convenient to the de. '
partment, or in all respects so useful to the I
public as the one in question. Cut having t
offered all that the law admitted and more *
jvwtiqp and more than justice and good poL | *
icy would have sanctioned had no law been ; I
parsed, the department does not feel itself; i
in any way responsible for the public in. J
convenience which may ensue. 11

laving unintentionally, and in a sportive renark,
wounded the feelings of Polk, a

he tender of an apology from H. Whether
t was accepted or not we cannot say, but
nfer not, as Polk proceeded on the same
evening to I Iaye's office, and, after calling
him out, inflicted personal chastisement
with a whip. Here the affair terminated,

shock the public mini beyond any event of

section of the State for a series or years.
The principals and their connexions are all
highly respectable ; whilo the unfortousto **
victim has been hurried to a premature

fulher could bestow. To that father, now

I ATEST FROM CHILI.
The barque PhiilipHone arrived at New
York on Wednesday in the short space of
84 days from Valparaiso. On the 17th
ult., in lat. 8 degi. 40, long. 44 degs. 6, a
very severe shock of an earthquake was
felt on hoard, which lasted 112 minute.
Correspondence of the Journal of Commerce,
Valparaiso, Sept 17, 1838.
VVe have advices from Lima to the 25.h
ult. The Chili expedition landed at Ancon
on the 7:h, and, after various unsuccessful
attempts at ne?ociation with General Orbe
goso, they ended by the latter declaring
war against Chili. The Chilians entered
Lima on the 21st, defeating the Peruvians.
Gen. Orbegoso fled to Turin, twenty miles
from Lima, with about 500 cavalry, and
Gen. Nieto retreated to the Castle ofCaL
Ion w th about 600 men, without firing a,
gun. fl'j was there deposed by his own
troops, who declared in favorof Geo. Santa
Cruz.
The Chilians lost about 200 men, and
the Peruvians the same number. At- last
dates there were about 1,200 men in the
ensile, and should the Chilians not succeed
in defea'ing them their situation will be very
precarious, as Gen. Santa Cruz was said
to bo within 20 days' march of Lima with
9,000 men. The general opiuion is that
the expcdiiion willjje a failure.
This Government are now preparing
2,000 men to send down to the relief of
their army at Lima.
