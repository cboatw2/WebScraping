-/aid if the tares on tea and coffee were
f taken off it would inevitably produce a
? necessity of raising the other duties above
2D per cent, thus violating the compromise
art. which he honed might be pre
| served inviolate if the duties were retainj
ed on these articles. Mr. Calhoun replied
| with great power and effect to Mr. Clay.
F He commented with much severity on the
delay in making known the deplorable
condition of the Treasury until it was announced
that the President had signed
a bill diverting a large and important
branch of the public revenue from ito le1
gitimate purposes. He asked the Senator
; where the proposed reforms and retrenchj
-inents that had been so lavishly promised
--instead of any attempt at reform, the
^ tvhofle Session had been consumed on projects
for squandering the public, treasure
L-. ?distributions?loans?taxes?banks, &c.
P .dtc. He thought that with proper attenI.
<tt?k>n to economy, the government might
f be carried on efficiently for three or four
I millions less than were expended last year,
f instead of which the expenditures for the
present year are six or seven millions
more. The present bill was to go into
[ operation in two or three weeks, impoL
sing duties of 20 per cent, upon articles
K now free, with scarcely any .notice to the
( importer, and th? consequence would be
that some would be greatly injured, while
others would he greatly benefitted by its
operation. He proposed that by general
1 consent the compromise net should be re*
! vised. Let all the duties above 20 per
cent go down gradually to that point, and
those under 20 per cent, go up, until the
proper point was reached which would afford
an adequate revenue for the ecooomi*
% cal expenditures of the government. Mr.
I Clay replied to Mr. Calhoun at some
! length, and the question was ihen taken
on the pending motion, which was to
| place tea and coffee among the free articles,
and was carried?ayes 30, noes 10.
A motion was then made to place salt
among the free articles, pending the dist
* cussion of which, the Senate adjourned.
In the House, the only business done
was the disposing of the McLeod resolu><
lion, which was laid on the table;

Rtins in Central America.?For
?. rt l.-i.l
rome time past the Uhevaner rreuentuX
sthal, attache of the Austrian Legation,
* has been exploring the ruins of Central
America. Perhaps no one better fitted
for this labor than this gentleman, could
hare been induced to undertake it. Belonging
to a noble family at hoine and of
eminent attainments in science, his labor
was undertaken merely for the advaocement
of science itself, and with the expectation
of no reward but the reputation
v that should follow his successes.
This gentleman travelled by himself,
^ lived like the Indians, and at night encamped
on the ground as one of them.?
He has tpent the last nine months in that
country, and during that time has been
1^' ... . among the ruins of cities where the foot
r. of a white man never was before, and
1: which are unknown even to the most recent
travellers. lie mentions the ruins of
one cnlonade where there are yet 10 rows
of columns,--in each of which are -IS ro'
lumns?in all 48D columns. lie had with
' him a complete Daguerreotype apparatus,
* and with it has taken a great number of
excellent impression*. This often required
two Indians to hold his table against
" the force of the wind, two also to keep
steady the apparatus, others to protect it
from the sun, <fcc. We had yesterday the
pleasure of seeing these impressions at his
hotel, and they surpass any thing of the
kfnd which we have seen, in distinctness
and excellence. From the impressions
when magnified, he has made drawings
which show the original, by their richness,
elegance and finish, to be the work
of a highly cultivated people.
The impressions of Uxmul when compared
with the sketches of Palenque, show
a far more advanced state of cultivation
by the inhabitants of the former place.?
The ornaments on the temples signify
that their religion was of a most sensual
kind.
In some future year it is expected that
this invaluable collection, with the results
of these labors, will be given to the public,
And when it is recollected that Austria
has in her possession the original
manuscriDts and the drawing of Curtez
<who invaded Mexico, with which these
I,, may be compared that some light will be
* thrown on the character of that wonderful
people who preceded us on this continent.

Mackerel Fishery.?The manner in
which Mackerel are caught, is thus described
by a correspondent of the Lowell
Courier:
Every person han two lines, with two
hooks on each, and even when the fish are
most plenty, an experienced hand can
with perfect ease tend two lines, while a
tyro finds difficulty in preventing one from
becoming entangled, as he draws in the
fish, or throws the line out again. Mackerel
always go in schools, but it is not
every school that will bite; when they will
will, not bite they are said to be 44schooling
In this case, they are seen in large numbees,
with their heads nearly out of water
swimming with great swiftness, so,:jbiimes
round and round, having the appearanee
of being frightened. A school can be seen
a half a mile distant, and whenever one is
perceived the vessel endeavors to ' run into
it," and stop it by throwing bait among
ihem, which they sometimes succeed in
doing. This bait, which is used for the
purpose of keeping the school, about the
vessel, consists of other fish taken on
board in pott and sailed. It is ground up
j very fine in a '4bait mill," and always used
while fishing. The hooks are baited with .
a small piece offish taken from the throat
of the mackerel that are caught, and when
this cannot be procured with pieces of (
pork. They bite, very quick, much like
a pickerel, and must be drawn in the instant
they are felt touching the hook ? .
There is no mercy shown to the fish after
he is taken; by a jerk of the line the hook
is torn from his mouth, and he falls into a
barrel or on deck. Frequently after they
cease biting the remainder of the school is (
seen swimming about near the surfuce of (
the water, in which case, they are "guffed (
or hooked up, with an instrument called
a "gaff," which is an iron or steel rod, two
feet long, bent at the end like a hook but '
without a beard, and attached to a
pole about six feet long. When the fish
have all disappeared, {probably sunken)
the fisherman proceed to dress, wash, and
salt those caught, which is done with such
despatch by those practised in the business,
that in less than an hour after we
had ceased fishing, several barrels were
salted, and the ciew's work ended for the
day. Ii
Melancholy Accident and Strange Coin- j
cidence.?Sermon Bonsall, Esq, a citizen 1
of the town of Raymond, Mississippi, was |s
accidentally killed bv a fall from his mule s
on,the 17th inst. He died between fourand 5
five o'clock, P. M. at the residence of his i
relative, Green E. Beauchamp. Esq., 7 1
miles west of Raymond, at which place he \
- * *' r :i? d '
was on a visu wun ins mumy. :m. uuwsell
was a gentleman highly respected by (
his fellow citizens, and was buried with
Masonic and military honors. J
The Raymond Times says that the resi- ]
dence of the deceased was struck by light-.
ning on the day that he expired, and as \
nigh as can be ascertained it was about the f
same moment in which he died! 11
The manner of the lightning was singu- '
larand unusnal. The sun was shining, 1
nor were there any indications of an ap- )
proaching thunder storm, when, at a mo- 1
ment totally unexpected, there was a most 1
appalling discharge of electricity, accompanied
by an instantaneous peal of thun- J
der. The fluid descended in two volum- 1
es upon the premises of Mr. Bonsell.?
the one scathing a small locust tree that,
stands some 15 feet from the chimney?
the other striking the gable end of the
house about 18 inches from the chimney.
The latter after striking near the edge .
of the roof, descended along a row of nails :
perpendicularly to the level of the mantle
piece?on which a clock was standing, (
and beinj? attracted bv the metal, it enter
cd through the wall, utterly destroying the i
clock and strewing the floor with the fragments.
Had the family been at home
they would doubtless have been killed, or
at least seriously injured.
Mr. Bonsell was a lawyer by profession
and a native of Pensylvania. At an early
age he removed to South Carolina, and
1 was associated with the Hon. Win C. ;
| Preston in the practice of law, at Colurn- J
bia, from which place he subsequently removed
to Raymond.'

upon a tract of land containingTwo Honored Acres, !
nearly the whole of which is laid oiT into lots, and t
will be for sale to the highest bidder. I
Shelby is the seat of justice of the now County |
of Cleveland, established at the last session of the
Legislature. It ia situated about midway between 1
Rutherfordton, and Li icolnton, and about 30 iniles
from Yorkville und Spsrtanburgh C. H ,S.C.,near
the roan crossing Broad River at duinn's Ferry, ,
upon a beautiful level ridge, free from mud, and only
one mile and a half from Wti-sos's SULPHUR
SPRINGS.
The Subscribers are sure, that to those persons ]
deiirous of procuring an agreeable and healthy resiI
dence, no place could present greater advantages.
The situation is high, dry, and healthy. It is well '
waicreu, near uroaa mver, and a tnicK setwea .
neighborhood. There are a large number of 8ai 4
Mills near, and every other convenience for ba>'- 1
ding, and Wilson's Springs only fifteen minutes ride
distant. Nothing is necessary "to be said <>fthe char- c
acter of these Springs. They are regarded as being
inferior to none in the Southern conntry, and
hundreds ot invalids can attesttheir healing properties.
Within a hundred yards of (be Wilson's
White Sulphur Springs, there is a red snlphur, and
a Chalybeate Spring, and there are several other
Sulphur Springs in the immediate neigeborhood of f
Shelbv, though none equal to Wilson'* for medicin- r
