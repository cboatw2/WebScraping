EPIDEMIC AMONG HORSES.
A disorder is prevailing extensively
among Horses throughout the Southern
States?In North Carolina, Sooth Carolina,
*nd Georgia, it is very general, and we
understand farther West.
? The symptoms are an irritability of the
whole system?with fcvorishness, and in
^ some cases actual fever?slight watering or
mattering about the eyes?with a cloudiness
about the cornea?languor?refusal to eat
d?slight husky cough with slight dicharge

bowels comes on. Should the catarrhal
symptoms oot be controlled early, swelling
of tb? glands of the throat and neck take
place wi h inflammation of the windpipe
and lungs?high fever and puffing of the
kin?the inflammation of the eyes increases
and result# in blindness?the stiffness of
the limbs bocomes worse?spasms come on
?with intense ferer, and inflammation of
the brain or luags takes plafce, and death
follows quickly.
In many of the cases rest and light feed
are all that is necessary. The disease
continues but three or four days. In most
of the cases which have occurred in our
neighborhood, the irritability of the system
, has been checked, and the disease controlled
by single large bleeding, aod for

In one fatal case which we have seep,
symptoms of intense inflammation of the

another inflammation or the womb.
We consider (he disease as catarrhal?
o fleeting4he mucous membranes and glan.
dular system?coming on with a general
irritability of the whole system, which un.
less immediately removed, is followed by
inflammation of the most irritable organ of
the animal?in soroo horses there being a
greater disposition to have one organ affected
than another, as no'iced in mun?
colds producing affections of the air lubes,
bowels, or r ieumatic symptoms, according
to porticuhu susceptibility of individuals to
take on dtvuase of those kinds.
While noticing the present epidemic, we
would throw out a few hinn on (lie diseases
of horses io general. Most of them are
inflammatory, and the extraordinary power
. of the heart and arterial system riqurcs,
that where fever is present; the most vigorous
depleting measures should be used at
on early period. More horses die of inflammation
of the stomuch and bowels than
from any other disease, and most persons
who have given attention to the subject, notice
how very rapidly inflnmmation runs its
course in a horse. This renders it important
to attend to symptoms immediately,
and we con scarcely go wrong in bleeding
a horse with symptoms of colic or bots?.

horses are lost by waiting for the operation
of a purge?in twelve or fifteen hours inflammation

bleedings followed by large doses (preferable
by enema) of Laudanum are more sue.
cessful in controlling inflammation than any
other means?and we consider this as the
most valuable treatment in aCute cases of
- this kind. In Chronic affections cathartics
or laxatives may be used beneficially.
A long controversy has occupied for.
riert and gentlemen who attend much to
horses on the subject ot bots. A great
many insist that they are injurious to the
Horse and cause death?while others are
"pefectly convinced that they are harmless.
Writers of high reputation are arrayed on
both sides, and believe, (like the knights of
the shield, who viewed it from opposite
sides and fought about their difference of
opinion) tbey may both be tight. During

It is much to be regretted, that medical
gentlemen pay so little attention to the dls.
eases of this noble animal. How many
valuable lives might be saved, if they did
not consider it bnneath the dignity of the
profession to be Horse Doctors !
"Of all domesticated animals, the H< rse
has the most powerful claims on the syrr,.
pa:hy and attention of the medical procti.
tioner. The lawyer may construct his
briels?the parson may perform his clerical
duties?and the merchant may grow rich
. in his counting house with little assistance
from the horse; but to the medical man,
this spirited and intelligent animal is as
essential as the knowledge which he re
quires in the schools, or the medicines which
ie prescribes for his patients. The horse is
his companion and best friend in the country.
He carries him proudly through the
crowded street?he conveys him snfuly
over the midnight heath. Ho shares with
his master in nil the toils and in many of the
dangers of professional hfe. Ho is ns much
exposed fo the elements?more indeed than
the physician and surgeon?and lie is not
exempt from many of the diseases to which
hit superior is liable. To mil* tarnation,
fever, rheumatism, organic disease of the
heart, liver and lungs-the horse is very
prone; and the study o! his mtiaoies is as
accessry to the medical practitioner in a
pecuniary point of vie*-, as it is interesting
in a pathological."?Dr. J. Johnson.

^ So long os a horse is healthy and able to
work he is highly esteemed,but as soon as he
becomes diseased we are very apt to order
him to **go to grass," or we think ourselves
lucky to get some one else to take him off
our hands. If a faithful servant were to
become sick, and wo give him away to gei
rid of the trouble of keeping him, we should
be considered unjustifiable and cruel, bur
with a dumb beast of a horse there is notk

our thoughts as we do from our presence.
This is a common pr ctice; but we know
of many exceptions, and take pleasure in
stating the Tact. The improving spirit of
attention to fine s,ork is correcting the
abuse ehewhere. VVu trust that it will do
so with us. Carolina Planter.
t The question in regard to the injury done
by bots in Whether tliey^ever attack the stomach;
and not Whether they do so always when pro.
sent. It is welt known they do not always. We
onoe saw an animal die in great agony, the sc.tt
of which|was evidently some part ofthe abdomen,
; as was evinced by hor actions. On examination
after death, the stomach was found to contain
a large number of bots, with the internal coat
abraded in large spots, and a number of the
bota actually clinging to the stomach about the
edges of tlieso spots. Hera we had occuLr
proof that hot* did in one instance, at least, attack
the stomach. It was a number of years
since, when we understood loss of the animal
economy than wo now do, or our observation
might have been more particular.-Ed. Far. (*az.
HINTS ON HORSES FEET.
To the Editor of the iY Y. Spirit of Times:
Dear Sir,?As this is a season oftue year
in which a great number of gen-iemen pur.
chase their horses, i will not be inappropriate
to give to the inexperenced a few hi-its
respecting the horse's fool, than which their
is no part t>f him more important. No gentleman
would willingly drive a lame horse,
nnd th6 cure of the di ease becomes, therefore,
a matter of general interest.
As I intend to consider the foot, fully, it
is necessary that I should examine the anatomy
and physiology of it, which I will do
as concisely as possible, for it is of the greatest
importance to the ara -teur that he
should ha vesome knowledge of the construe,
tionof these parts, both for his own gratification
and to detect ihe impostures practised
by someofour soidistant Veterinary Sur*
- * * ? v_
geoas, should bo appeal to them lor auvic**.
This coumry is not like Europe, where the
Veterinary Surgeou is required to go through
a preparatory course of study, like other
Physicians or Surgeons, and must have hid
diploma from a regular Veterinary College
before he can practice Ins profession. In
shis country, any one choosing to call himrclf
by that name is received as a Vetcrinaty
Surgeon without further inquiry, and
hence the profession of thb branch ofxnedicine
here is at so low an ebb that it is Tokened
almost disreputable to belong to it. Bui

f the Legislature by our public spirited citizens I
> who own horses, to found a Veterinary Col- f
i lege in this city, which would soon place the s
. study of the diseases incident to that noble f
animal on a more desirable footing. r
i Placed on a such a basis, scientific meif tl
i would be induced to engage in the professi
ion, and it would be no longer considered b
t derogatory to the character of a gentleman s
I to be So occupied, nor should we longer be p
, tho mere copyists of Europe in Veterinary c
> science. But it's time we began to exam- *'
I jne the horse's foot, anatomically and physi- f<
, ologically ; that part of the foot which is vi- '
? sible when the horse stands on the ground *
f is called the crust, or wall of the foot, its ll
r general figure is a truncated cone, and is ?
> divided into the toe or an'erfe>; pert, quarters h
r or lateral parts, and heels or poStffrtor parts; ft
where the hoof and the hair entirely encircle U
I the superior part of the foot it is called the c
coronet, immed ately undernea h which is h
I the coronary ligament, from which the crust c
, is secreted in long filamen'ous horny, fibres, a
' which extend downwards and forwards the c
I whole length of the hoof. They are nutur- u
t ally aggfutimoted together, but may be se- a
panned by maceration into distinct fibres ; tl
i on raising the foot from the ground and ex .i
amining the under surface, it will be pTcei- v
ved that the crust does not terminate at the tc
i heel, but is inflected suddenly inwards, for. si
ming a very acute angle and, exending o
down the s.des to the point of ihe frog. This ol
inflection is called the bar, winch n very nr
often cut awjiy by the farrier, under pretence ol
of opening the heels, which purpose would si
be better answered by leaving tnem alone. 01
All the inferior surface of the foot extending f]
round the frog is called thesole, while that p<
portion of it extending backwards, filling up in
the angle formed by the ii.fl ctron of the d<
crust, is the seat of corns. Th?? triangular in
por ion in thfc centre of the foot is called the y
frog* and consists of an apex and base, or >
two bulbs divided by a fissure in the middle at
called the cleft. This is the seat of running
thrush, and the fissures on either side con. ?<
. necting it with sole are called its commi- 1
sure8, gi
On removing the hoof from the wnsible
foot and examining its internal surface, we
are struck at once with the peculiar laminated
structure that meets the eye. Its ap pearance
is very similar to the under surface
of a mushroom, while about Ave hund- y
red of these plates extend round the whole
crust. |There is, of course, a similar number
of sensible lumiose attached to the os pedis

abb* mass of cariil ign-hgarm-ntous and fatry ^
matter, and forms an excellent wedge for V
preventing contraction, provided it is not P
'pared away, or pluced out of the way of all ^
pressure, as is too often the case. The ^
Horn's which properly In-long to the foot are 01
two, t)?e principal one being the os pedis, or
coffin bone, and the navicular bo. e, and the 81
inferior part of the os coronas. The exter- ?
nrd form of the os pedis is very similar to ^
Mat i.f ihe hoof; its externa' surface being ?
very rough for the attuehmenf of the sensible 0
jfirnmse ; is is very porous, being perfora.ed
w th torimina in idld-rectNins, for the trins. c
mission of biood- vessels and n*Tvei; its in. P
ferior surface is smooth and concave, the 81
posterior arched and rough, for the insertion
of the tendon of Me Jlexor pedis perforans ,r

of a sessamoid bone, and where the tendon a
of \Ue Jlexor perforans passes over it,, there n

ted States.
The introduction of improvements in the
Ik culture will be much more readily ef<
cted among an educated and intelligenteople,
having no prejudices in favor of
Id modes, and every thing to learn anew,
ian among those whose uneducated minds
avc, by long hab?t? become wedded to par,
cular usages, in the central and northern
arts of France, the disadvantages of dilate
have been in n*greaOrfc*gree overcome
y art. The adoption of improvements in
.a o/tnsfnirfinn at enrnnnnrics. so as to in
ire warmtK nnd that free ventilation so inHpensable,
have ennbled them to oiiiain in
vicinity of Paris three times th? weight
f cocoons from a given quantity of eggs that
i the average produce in jhe Southern deartments,
the consumption of ieafrs being
t ihe same time fifty per cent. less. Atlhe
lodel establishment at Bergeries d?* Senart,
ear Paris, under itie direction of M. Camlee
Beauvois, the results obtained have in.
et d surpassed all anticipations. The silk
lade- is remarkable for its lustre and
rength and commands an extra price.?
/ith 1,000 kilogrammes, or one ton
2,240 pounds) of leaves, not sorted or
icked, Mr Benuvais has produced 00 kilo,
rames, or about 200 pounds of cocoons.
V mulberry plantations at Bergeries ocupy
about 35 acres of ground, and when
ley get irno full bearing are expecied to
ipply sufficient foliage to rear the product
f at learn one hundred ounces of eggs, M.
ieuvais preserves his silkworm eggs not
nly to any period of the ensuing year most
anvenient to have tnem hatched, but even
11 the year fallowing this, in which last
use ihe eggs have been found to hatch
eriectly well, and go through all their
lagt 8 with regularity and vigor.
By raising the temperature and increasig
the number of repasts, he accomplishes
is fenJinga in from twenty-two to twenty.
>ur days, thus saving much valuable time
nrl labor which mnv be devoted to trimming
iuIberry trees and other objects connected
'ith the business. The rapidity of the
enring has not beeu found to impair the
alue of the silk. M. Beauvais has exened
imself to diffuse all the information upon
le subject which his opportunities enabled
im to do. His cocoonery is open to all
isiters, and, during two months of the rear*
tig season, he receives gratuitously those
/ho place themselves under him for the
lenefit ofhis observations and practical induction.
Among the scientific individuals who
lave devoted special attention to the silk
culture is M. Rabinet, member of the Roy.1
Academy ofyjedicinc. He is director ol
hejGovernment model cocoonery at Poiciers,
wh^re he has distinguished himself by
ho success of his labors. He gives gratutous

ruary, and cdrwVs of two lectures a week, l
delivered on Wednesdays nnd Saturdays,
immense advantages must result from the
lectures of.Robrnef, and the practical eourse
of instruction by Benuvais.
In a recent report mode by Bourdon to
the French Minister of. Agriculture nnd
Commerce,* he, gives a statement of the
success obtained in cocooneries where the
new modes of heating and ventilating have
bqen adopted, to a greaser or less extent,
compared, in many instances, with results
artewJum upon the ordinary plans. He firtt
presents the experience of iho model co.
cooneries established in the departments of
from* and Vnucltise.
In the first," says he, "at Faventinrs,
near Valence, the beautiful race of silkworms
called White ^imv^htained from M.
Benuvttis, yir-WetT ?Tjp?bduct of T^kno&raritf*
mes (or about 171 lbs )'?of cocoons, with a
consumption of 1 000 kilogrammes, (or
about one ton 6f 2,240 lbs.) of leaves. 'iVo
races of worms* produced yellow cocoons,
one from Piedmont, the other from Ardeche,
gave 165 lbs. and 158 lbs. of cocoons for
the same.quaniiiy of leaves.
"In the second cstabhshmeftV situated
upon tl?e grounds of the Marquis of Balia.
cour., near Pnlud, (Vyncluse,) upon the '
bank* of the.Rhpne, in a locality where the
mulberry leaves are Very watery and but
little nutritious, M. Puhz'?f.has.ohroineK] 132 '
lbs. of cocoons to the ton of leaves. He.
operated with the eggs of the White $ina,
obtained wider the superintendence of M.
Aubert, it) the Royal Domain of Neuilly,
wti'ch eggrtho King, In his enlightened zeal
for the succes of the culture, had requested
to be -placed nt the disposal of the Mftrqws
of B ilrncourt.^ * ^
"The produce of oti?er cocooneries of this
proprietor, managed upon the common
plan, do not yield more thart from 44 ibe.
to 56 lbs. of cocoons to the ton of leaves."
With some difference in the proportions
of leaves consumed, similar crops of Co*
coons appear to have been procured by
nearly all the feeders wha have availed'
themselves of the salutary influences to be
derived from a uniform temperature and
constant renewal of the air.- Thus M. ;
Thannnron, member of-the Agricultural So.
c ly ot Drome, obtained on his estate, near
Valence, 168 lbs.i>f cocoons to fhu ton df
leave*.
M. Robert,at Saint Tulle,near Mansoque,
deps of Lowor Alps, obtained the fof.
lowing results : The product of eight ounquality.
It must be observed that M. Rob.
ett only gave his worms the advantage of;
the new mod* of ventilation after they had
passed the third.moulting. Not having net
hurdles, his worms were fed on temporary
i J ti !
Donra siwivcg. .
Upon' M. Robert's estate^ the average
product of feedings made by his tenants,
who pnrsued the olJ raetltbds, was only
about 61 lbs. of cocoons to the ounce of
eggs. M.
Mazade, jr. at Aaduz, (Card,) in ope.
fating upon 12 ounces of eggs, obtained
605 kiltogrammes (about 1,331 lbs.) of fine
cocoons with a consumption of 9,103 kilo,
grammes (abom 20,000 Jbs.) of leayps:
that is to say, ebout 147 iba. of cocoonsrfor
ivory toa of leaves consumed.
The same amount of foliage afforded him
.only about 88 lbs. of cocoons in his other
apartments, which, though* superintended
by himself, had hot the advantages of that
ventilation arificial temperature, together
with the perfect equality in the several stages
and frequency of rrepasts, maintained in the
system of Beauvajs and Daroet. The Agricultural
Commission of AlaifraWarded a
gold medal toJd. Maaade, with the expression
of its thanks, for the fmo example set
to his district.
The temperature mabtained io the - cocoonery
during the experimental feeding of
M. Mazade ranged botweon 77 deg.| and
73 deg. Fali't, whilst the degrees of moisture
ascertained by De Saussure's hygrometer
varied from 65 dog. to 85 deg.
We leoro from M, Mazade tho highly
interesting fact that the whole amount of laborrequired
in this rearing of the produce
of 12 ounces of silkworm eggs consisted of
111 days work, of which thdseofmen were
46, and those of women 65.
Now, supposing the wages the samo as
those set down in Bourdon's calculation,
namely, 40 cents per day for men and 25
cents (or women, then Will the whole expense
of labor amount to $34 65, which is
much below the expense of rearing estimated
by Bourdon, namely, for feeding the
produce of only ten ounces of eggs. *
The 1,331 lbs. of cocoons, sold at 35 j
'cents per lb. would bring $465 85, which,
sum, to those growing their own trees, {
would afibrd a handsome profit, even after
allowing 50 or 100 per cent, additional for j
exoense nf labor, and saving nothing ofj
premium or Sine bounties' Supposingthe j
' cocoons reeled off into good raw 6i'k, and
sold at $5 per lb. the proceeds of the orop j
would be increased lo nearly 8700. . j

I enable him to make twelve pounds of rrele4
silk. He states that his ground was by oo
means rich* and the trees small, though
pretty cfesc together. At this rate, more
than 20,000 lbs. of ft?|iag?-can be obtained
from two acres of multicaulis t recta, the
first year of planting. Here is a fact of
immense importance to us in tho United
States, and, for the- clear demonsttation of
which, to say nothing of other services he
has rendered his country, we feel ourselves
under great ehJigutions to Mr. MeLeatn?
The multicaulis, and, indeed, any other variety
of mulberry, will afford nt least three
times ns much foliage the second year as
the first.

We hovb seen, however, that M. Beauvais
has obtained at Bergen**, nenr-Putfs, 1 lb.
of cocoons to 10 lbs. of leaves, which is tt
saving of 60 per cent, both in fbliago and
the labor of gathering nnd. distributing.
One of the most romn/kuble instances of
success-reported by M, Bourdon is tint ob.
tnijted by M* Plane!, Vice President of the
Tirjbunnl of Valence, and member of the
Agricultural Society? Por .many years hia
cocooneries had bken almost entirely swept

The examples here cited will suffice to
show the advantages derived from the nejv
system of rearing silkworms, introduced in.
to Fraoce by Beauvuis and Da reef, founded
chiefly upon the combined infiuences of a
high and uniform temperature with increased
frequency ofropaats, and constant renewal
of the air. "It
ia true," (M. Bourdon observes in re.
lation to this sys*em,) "that the cares and
attentions are multiplied ; that very frequent
removals of the litter are absolutely neceseary
; that the least neglect in the distribu
tipo of the repasts cannot fail to ue atenflcd
with serious consequences. But, on the
other hand, the duration of the attentions
and anxious solicitudes of the feeder is
abridged, the ill effect* of changes in iho
weather diminished, the moons of producing
refrigeration?always more difficult to apply
than those of procuring warmth?ore provided.
The rearings may he finished be.
fore the coining on the tonffes, especially in
late seasons. Finally, the tree, being sooner
stripped of its leaves, does not suffer so
much as when these ore gathered i derJP
It is very evident tint, as this forcing
system of rearing admits of no deficiency
offpod, and no dolaysdn its distribuiibh, a
sufficiency of manual labor must be &tcomma
rub in order to carry it out thoroughly..
We will introduce a very short description
of the model establishment at Rcxgeries,
near Paris, which will give some distinct
notions of the means which tfie objects con*
templated are accomplished.
The apartment destined so the rearing
of worms is 72 feet (French) i?. length, by
22 wide, and 14 high. The furnaces ami
air chambers, for heating.or cooling the air,
aro outside, and the warm or cool arr is :n.
troduced at pleasure through pipes or fioep,
constructed of wood, and placed in or rather
under the floor. These flues are pierced
.with holes at suitable distances, being made
larger and larger in arithmetical proportion
! as they recede from the air chamber. Cor.
reiponding flues and holes are placed above,
