" Fattening rattle for beef, is well know n
to be performed, by jjrazintr tbcm at iii>ertv
in tiie pastures, and siali-foeding them
at home. Th latter is most commonly
practised, in the wititer se son, but it is
equally practicable and b nebcin! in summer:
and the universal n elect of so certain
a mean for the acquisition of so great
and uncommon profit, must go to the account
of our indolence, or our unaccountable
prejudices. The success of fattening
oxen by mow ing the green meat (grass) of
whatever kind, during the summer, has
been often and fuily ascertained. The
meadows and pastures are thus pros rvod,
and may be manured to infinite y grcib r

So savs Lisle. And Lawrence adds,
4t cattle well wintered arc half summered."
Cattle lelt out late in the fall, should he
foddered early in the morning, and i:ot ho

upon it, whicii indeed lhe\ dislike.?Lisle.
This caution is of particular importance in
the north, where vast numbers of cattle
and sheep peris!) annually from disorders
occasioned by receiving concealed water
into their stomachs.?Lute mice.
When a beast is lat, he will show himself
so to the eve, by a roll ot let as big as

Cow to be dried within two months of
her calving, as, to milk her longer, most
certainly impoverishes both cow and calf,
to a far greater amount than the value of
the milk. All young animals, well kept,
arc the better for it ever alter; heifers
come to the pail earlier lor it, and bullocks
fa tie n earlier.?Lisle.
The first calf of an heifer best for rearing;
the reason alleged, that the cowcould
not be reduced by milk during gestation.
Late fallen calves, in May and
June, never so ha.dv when grown up, or
bear the winters so w ell, as those dropped
in March; the chief reason ot this is, because
late fallen calves must be weaned
late, and as thev a'wavs pitch. eMail away
a htile on weaning, the approach ofw'inter
prevents their recovery; and nothing aiter,
wards makes amends.?Lisle.
Fir branches. " 1 was so pinched last
spring for provender to cattle, that I had
not a stone of straw orhav from the middled
March; nothing but whins and oats
for horses, and lir tops (that is, lender
shoots of lirs) for cattle; and i had IU0
horned cattle, and about 120 horses, small
and great, of which 1 lost but four <>r live ;
but there were numbers of cattle that died
in tins country for want. Some lost one .
half, nd *omo almost the whole. As many
branches were lopped olTus wool 1 sutiice '

plantation th.nnings (houghs and leaves of
trees) to like purpose, and with equal sue- i

i bollocks eat the leaves and small twigs. J

ERROR OF OVER-TASKINGTHF. INTELLECTUAL
POWERS OF CHILDREN. '
The provalen' and pernicious custom of
tasking the minds and confining l!ic bodies
of children for hours in succession at homo
and in schools, at a time of life when the
growth of the body and the welfare of the
system require cons'an! and playful exercise
in the open air, and perfect freedom
from rare and excitement of mind, is the
fruitful source of much future bad health,
and is eminently calculated to defeat die object
aimed at by paroirs, namely,the mental
excellence of the child. The premature
cxer ion of intellect Jo which it is stimulated
by the cons'ant excitement ofemulation and
vani:v, far from strong heninjx, tends to impair
the health and tone of :ho brain, and of
nil the organs depending on it; and hence
we rarely perceive the genius of the school
manifesting in future years anv of the superiori
y which a traded attention in early
life; hut we find him on the contrary, either
sunk hc'ow mediocrity, or dragging out a
painful exis ence, the vie im of indigestion
and mc'ancholy. On he o'her iiand, some
of the mosl distinguished men who ever
lived were in childhood remarkable only for
Ileal h, idleness, and apparent stupidity.
The illustrious Newton was, by his own account,
an idle and inattentive boy, and
"verv low in the school." till he readied 12
years of ago; and the young Napoleon him.
self is described as "having good health,
an 1 b' ing in other respec'slike other boys."
Adam Clarke was considered "a grievous
iunc " when a boy. ai d was seldom praised ;
by his father except for his ability in rolling
htrgc stones; which his robust frame and
good health enabled him to do. Sliakspeare, '

& that freedom of mind, which conrihu;cd
so much to their future excellence.
Flic mo horof Sheridan, too. Ion? regarded
him as "the dullest and most hopeless of her

Anion?the many who give great promse
in early life, nnd whose talen s are then
forced by ill judged cultivation into precocious
ma uri y. how few live to manhood to
reap the reward of their exertions, and how
few of hose who survive preserve their su- ]
perioritv unimpaired! Tasso was early j

Experience, indeed, amply demonstrates,1
that precocious and excessive activity of intellect
and vivacity of feclingare most powerful
impedimcn's to healthy and vigorous j
liges'ion, and consequently 4o a sufficient j
nu rition. In earlv lite, therefore, when not i
only health, but future usefulness, depends 1
mainly on die completeness and vigor;
ivi'h which the system shall proceed to- i
wards its full developenicnt. the prcserva- ;
:ion of the digestive organs by suitable diet, I
\xcrcise, and regimen, ought to be a prima- j
ry object of atention with every sensible!
wont, liven as regards superiority of |
mind, the healthy developcment of the body j
s of essential importance, as the only sure :
otindadon on which mon'al excellence can 1
ae built; because, so long as mind and body |
ire intimately connected with each other,
lie former must continue to be affected by i
?very change in the condition of the organ- i
zation 011 which it depends. We enjoy j
idleness of vision by preserving the eye i
11 high health, and exercising i* regularly '

PARENTAL EXAMPLE.
}>u: all endeavors to make right impressions
on the mind of a child will verv genm
1
rally be found inefTectunl, if the character
;>f the narent does not correspond with his
Instructions, and inspire his child with his j
steem and affection. It is surprising how
liod honors his own image among men. '
Paint as it is, even in the best, still its prox- 1
mity gives it effect, and it exercises a per. ;
ion of his own sovereign power ever the
hearts of his creatures. Tnis has been
found to be the case in a remarkable man- i
rtcr among savage and idolatrous nations, j
when holy men have lived for a length of i
imc among ihem as Missionaries. Every j

fill ascendancy -he holy Swartz obtained !
aver the Hindus of all ranks, from ihc j
highest to the lowest. But it is unnecessa- !
ry to look so far from home, to he convin- ;
:ed of 'his truth. We every dav see it ex-1
mplificd among ourselves in the respect j
md affec'ion whicli good men generally J
acquire, when their bght has long shone before
the same neighborhood. If the heau- :
ies of the Christian character thus rccom* !
inend themselves to persons of ma'uro age, i
ivhose evil habits are often so confirmed,!
md whose tastes are so vitiated, it will not
be mat er of wonder that they should have i
peculiar charms for the minds of children, i
Let a parent exhibit this character with !
consistency and prudence, and he will scliom
fail to be loved and revered by his I
children. And when this is the case, what
in hority will belong to his example ! what
weight to all his admonitions ! what ready
'tteirion will be paid to his verv wishes ! ;
The difficulties of education will be won-j
lerfuily smoothed. Ill-humor, distaste to ;
particular studies, impatience under re- ;
-traints. 'we.service and 'Cci*. a dis;?r>si
lion to look on a parent as a hard master,
not to mention other evils, will be in a very
greaf decree avoided. If it may be allow|
able to use the Prophet's language,4> crooked
places will be made straight, and rough
places plain." Put in proportion as a :
parent tails to resemble in character that
Divine Being who appoints him. as it were,
his vicegerent in his family, this picture will
fail to be realized : and in the worst cases '
it will he reversed.

forth increasing admiration, and reverence,

formation into a similitude of that excellence 1
which has found a way to his heart: and,
''beholding as in a glass the glory of the 1
Lord," lie will be "changed into the same
image from glory to glory, even as by the

From the Sunday School Journal.
AARON BURK.
The biographer of the late Colonel Durr.
does not hesitate to rank him among the
most unprincipled and heartless of libertines.
x\oi satisfied with a licentious career of
more than half a century, he carefully pre.

crimes, and never spoke of them but with
exultation. When it is known tiiat such a
man had pious paren;s, it is natural to inquire
what facts his life furnishes in corroboration
of, or as exceptions to, the principles
ol education, and the promises of the Bible
'! We regard the case, as far as the
only volume of his yet published carries
his history, (the forty-fourth year of his
age,) as a striking instance of the power of
religious instruction in infancy, requiring
many years of hold opposition to the force
of conscience wholly to overcome if. It is
a case of fearful warning to the children of
I O
pious parents.
The lather of Aaron Burr was a dis inguished
clergyman, and the first President
of lite College of New Jersey, at Princeton.
i y
His mother was the daughter of the cele1
brated Jonathan Edwards, the second President
of the same College. Both his pai
- i- i i r I _ 1.?! .U:_J
renis uieu oeiore iie reacneu mu uiiru wai
of I lis age; yet the piety of his mother, and
iter prayers on his behalf, were frequently
brought to his mind by the letters in which
she mentioned him whilst in his infancy.
His biographer inserts a letter written by
[ his mother to her father, a few months after
her husband's death, which letter w;is enclosed
to Col. Burr, by a pious ladv, with
the following among other remarks :?
O ^
Here in the wilds of , I have found
an extract of a letter, written by your inestimable
mother, nearly sixty years ago, of
which you are the principal subject, and a
transcript of which I shall enclose for your
; perusal. * * * The enclosed is calculated
to excite mingled sensation, and of
a melancholy and pleasing nature. The
hand that penned it is now among "die just
made perfect." Your mother had given
! you up by faith. * * * The great Augustine,
in his early years, was an infidel
in his principles, and a libertine in his conduc
, which his pious mother deplored with
bitter weeping. But she was told by her
friends that "ihc child of so many prayers
1 and tears could not be lost;"and it was veri|
ficd. to her happy experience, for he after!
wards became one of the grand luminaries
i of the church of Christ. This remark has
1 often been applied to you; and I trust you
I will yet have the happiness to find that "die
I prayers ol the righteous" have "availed
much."
Some expressions in the le ter of the
widowed mother may serve to remind parents
how well it is to bo resigned to the
will of God in removing their children; on
this ground, among others, of the uncertainty
of what i heir future characters may be.
My little son has been sick with the slow
fever ever since my lather left us, -and has
been brought to the brink of the grave.
But I "nope, in mercy, God is bringing him
up again. I was enabled to resign the
child (after a severe struggle with nature)
with the greatest freedom. God showed
me that the child was not my own, but his,
and that lie had a right to recall what he had
lent, whenever he thought fit; and 1 had no
reason to complain, or say God dealt hard 1
with me. This silenced me ! But how
goo-1 is Uo(]! lit? hath not only kept ine <
from complaining, hut comforted me by i
enabling me to after up the child by faith.
* * * Afb-r much self-examination
and prayer I did give up myself and chil- i
dren to God with my whole heart. * * * i
O, to be delivered from the power of Satan l
as well as sin ! 1 cannot help hoping the <
time is near. God is certainly r ting me
for himself; and when I think it will be soon
that 1 shall be called hence, the thought is 1
transporting. i
Ih.tr, made an orphan at so early an age the l
influence of his parents had scarcely any !
time to make an impression upon his mind;
and it is stated that when he was about four j'
years old, having been offended by some j i
one who bad charge of him, he ran from
home and was not \ >'*nd for thwe or four11
clays. At the age often, he escaped from J
the family of his uncle, in Elizabcthtown, <
New Jersey, and engaged to go our as a <
cabin-boy in a vessel at New York, hut ?
was discovered and brought back before it <
sailed. Such v. us the childhood of his way- t
ward career. ?
A short time before Burr graduated at c
Princeton College, (which he did at the \
early age of sixteen,) many conversions i
took place among the students, llis hiog- (
rapher observes tiiat from his infancy strong
impressions had been made upon his mind i
of the'existence of a Deity, and tiie ae- t
countabdi'V of man;" but he was not picas- c
ml with sumeof the circumstances of this c
' awakening." Yet beseems to have been s
somewhat influenced bv the prevalent state c
of feeling, for it is said that he sought "a I
free and full conversation with Dr. Wither
spoon, then the President of the College, oa t
ilu? ynfrnve " tlio rtfcnl; nf u*Mrh. as the an- '
thor status, was that his mind was some- r
what tranquilizer! hy the belief that it was
the spirit of fanaticism and not of religion i
by which liis companions were excited, c
I fo wrote as a College exercise, an Essnv on <
O ' ^ ^ k
ho passions, which now stands in his life f
is a striking rebuke upon his own course,
which had already begun to be licentious, i
Here is one paragraph: t
Do we not frequently behold men of 5
the most sprightly genius, by giving the I
reins to their passions, lost to society, and ]
reduced to the lowest ebb of misery and
despair ? Do we not frequently beho:J per- i
sons of the most penetradng discernment i
and happy turn for polite literature, by min- <
gling with the sons of sensuality and riot, <
blasted in the bloom ofiile 7 Such was the i
fate of the late celebrated Duke of Whnr- !
ton?Wijmot, Earl of Rochester?and vil- (
licrs, Duke of Buckingham?three noble- ;
men as eminently distinguished by their t
wit, taste, and knowledge, us tor tiicir ex- {
truvaganco, revelry, and lawless passions. (
In such cases, the most charming elevation, <
the finest fancy, the brightest blaze of gen- <
ius, and the noblest busrt of thought, call for i
louder vengeance, and damn them to last- |
ing infamy and shame. I
There were some other incidents showing i <
that, no withstanding the vicious course he j
was pursuing, there was still a secret unea- I
siness in his mind that he had to dispel before
he could enter upon his unbridled liber- <
tinism. One of his correspondent, in .
1772, afterwards the Rev. Dr. S. Spring, <
reminded him of the desire of hi* parents

The character of a meeting to be conven- 1
ed under such a uotice, at a period when <
there is much suffering among the poor, and 1
under the auspices of such men, could nor J
hut be foreseen. The notice itself was in- I
(lammatory. But even had it been ever so f
temperately worded, the very proclamation 1
for a meeting to act upon such topics, was
ofiiseifcalculated to arouse into burning t
fury the viic passions which the degraded *
portion of the press has been so earnestly 5
laboring, for 2 or three years past, to kindle
in the bosoms of the laboring classes, by r
their war-cry of the poor against the rich. >
Still, from the uncommon severity of the i
weather, yesterday, we indulged a hope that 1
the meeting would be thinly attended, and i
its spirits chilled into inaction.
Such, however, was not the case. At 4
nY!'*"k, a eoncmir*0 of several dien?ands <
\
had convened in front of the City Hull?
;om(K)Sed, as we arc assured, of the very
:anailL' of the city, arid ooinbiding within itself*ail
the elements ofouragc, r:ot and rev>fu*ions.
Moses J a q ties was selected as
he fitting chairman of such a meeting. But
>rd:-r was not the presiding genius en the
jccasion. and the mee ing was divided into
rarious groups, each of which was ha rangted
hy sonic chosen demagogue, after his
ivvn fashion, and on Iiis own consent.
Conspicuous among the orators was
Mow. Ming, jr., a patriot who has several
imes been honored as one of the Jackson
:andida:es for the office of Register of the

is represented as having bqp n less exiting

Ming introduced a set of resolutions, of the
rharncler of vvliicli wo are no fuither itiform d,
than thai one of them proposed a memorial
to the Legislature, praying tKe prolibi'ion
of a!l bank notes under the der.omnation
of one hundred dollars.?The illusrious
patriot was then uplifted upon the.boulders
of the sovereign mob, and borne
>roudly aloft to Tammary Hall, the proper
)!acc for all patriots of bis own complexion.
There were other speakers, however,
,v!io came directly to the business of the
meeting; and in the most exciting manner,
Jenounced the landlords, and the holders *
if flour, for the prices of rents and provisoes.
One of these orators, in the course of
lis address, after working upon the passions
if his audience, until tliey were fitted for
Ik; work of spoil and outrage, is reported
o have expressly directed the jiopular vengeance
against Mr. Eli Hart, who is one
if our most cxtensi e flour dealers, on
mmmissior. "Fellow citizens!" he exclaimed,"
Mr. Ilart has now 53,000 barrels
of flour iu his store: let us go and offer
lim 8 dollars a barrel, and if he does not
iL-p it"?}ipr? some nersoti touched the
>rator on the shoulder, and he suddenly
owe red his voice, and fin ished* the sentence
jy saying, "we will depart in peace." .?
The hint was sufficient, and having
?arricd Ming in triumph to the temple of
Anarchy, a large hody of the meeting moved
>ff iu the direction of Mr. Hart's store, in
Washington, between Dey and Courtlaml
streets. The store is a very large brick
building, having three wide but strong iron
doors upon the street. Being apprised of
the approach of the mob, the clerks secured
the doers & windows, but not until the middie
door had been forced, and some twenty cr
thirty barrels of /lour or more, rolled into
the street, and the heads staved in. At
this point of time Mr. Hart arrived himself
on the ground, with a posse of officers
from the police. The officers were assail:d
by a portion of the mob, in Dey street,
hi*ir ?tnvrs wrested from them, and shiv
cred to pieces. The numbers of the mob
lot being large at this time, the officers succeeded
in entering the store, and for a short
ime interrupted the work of des:ruction.
The mayor next arrived at the scene of
waste and riot, and attempted to remonstrate
with the infatuated multitude on the
ollv of their conduct?but to no purpose:
heir numbers were rapidly increasing, and
tis honor was assailed with missiles of all
sorts at hand, and widi such fury that he
va> compelled to retire. Large reinforcrnents
of the rioters having arrived, tlte offi-'
;ers were driven from the held, and the
>tore carried by assault?the first iron rloor
orn from its hinges, being used as a battering
am agahist the others. The Destructivet
it. once rushed in, and the windows and
Joots of the lofts were broken open. And
1-1 1- -tj .
low aga>n commenced me worn uiuesiruo
ion.
Barrels of flour, by dozens, fifties and
hundreds, were tumbled inio the street from
the doors, and thrown in rapid succession
from the windows, and the heads of those
that did not break in failing were instantly
staved in. Intermingled with the flour,
were sacks of wheat by the hundred, which
were cast into the streets und their contents
hrown upon the pavement. About one
liousand bushels gof wheat, and four or
ir five hundred barrels of flour were thus
wantonly and foolishly as well as ivull wick,
idly destroyed. The mijst.active of .the
iestmctioaisfs were foreigners?indeed the
greater part of the assemblage was of exotic
irigin: but there were probably five hurired
or a thousand others, standing by and
ibetting their incendiary labors.
Amidst the falling nd bursting of the
larrels and sacks of wheat, numbers of wo.
nen were engaged, like the crones who striphe
dead in battle, filling lite boxes and bos.
vets with which they were provided, and
- *
heir aprons, with flour, and making oit
vith it. One of the destructives, a boy,
mined James Roach, was seen upon one of
he upper window sills, throwing barrel afer
barrel into the street, and cryingouf with
?very throw?"here goes flour at eight debars
a barrel!"' Early in 'heassault, Mr.'
.'Iarfs counting room was eotered,. his
)ooks and papers seized aod scattered to
lie winds, And herein, .probably, consists
lis great loss. .%*
Night has now closed upon tlie scene; but
he work of destruction did out cease until
:?rong bodies of police arrived, followed,
;oon afterward, by detachments of troops.
The store was cleared, by Jus ice Lownda
ind Bioodgood, and several of the rioters'
vcre arres'ed, and despatched :o Brklewolt;.
