the fellow, as he scrambled up with <

The transport of the artillery and ammu- s
nition was the most difficult point; and a
to this accordingly, the chief consul gave h
his personal supeaintendence. The guns c
were dismounted, grooved into the trunks c
of trees hollowed out so as to suit each a
calibre, and then dragged on by sheer tl
strength of muscle-?not less than a hun- c
dred soldiers being sometimes harnessed r
to a single cannon. The carriages and tl
wheels, being taken to pieces, were slung d
on poles, and borne on men's shoulders. I
The powder and shot, packed into boxes y
of fire wood, formed the landing of all y
the mules that could be collected over a b
wide range of the Alpine country. h
These preparations had been made b
luring the week that elapsed between b
Buonaparte's arrival at Geneva, and the t.
commencement of Lame's march. He a
himself travelled sometimes on a mule, tl
but mostly on foot, cheering on the sol- p
liers who had the burden of the great t<
guns. The fatigue undergone is not to be s
described. I'he men in front durst not g
belt to breath, because tho least stoppage 6
there might have thrown the column be- I
hind into confusion, on the brink of deadly
precipices-: and those in the rear had to
ihvuiider knee deep, through snow and
ice trampled into sludge by the feet and
hoofs of the proceeding divisions. Hap*- si
pily the march of Napoleon was not har- d
rassed like thatjof Hannibal, by the as- T
saults of 'iving enemies. The mountain- 1

Death of the Chevalier Bayard.
The illustrious Bayard had been long
fdebrated throughout Europe -as the moel
of those graces which were considered
ssential to the -character of a perfect
night, and his fate was attended with
i>me interesting circumstances. After
aving repeatedly repulsed the enemy in
be battle of Reb6c, he received a shot
n the lower part of his body, which penerated
to the spine, rendered it impossile
for him to sit on his horse. Heat
nee felt the wound to be mortal, and
ommanded his soldiers to place him
gainst a tree, with his face towards the
nemy, observing, that he .lever turned
is back whilst fie fired, and would not
?giti to do so now that he was dyirig.?
[e then addressed himself to an officer
ho stood near?"Tell my liege lord the
ing," said he, " that I die happy, benise
1 die in his service, and that my
ngle regret is, that I can assist him no
>nger." Hiving said this, he held the
ross-hilt of his sword before him, using
as a crucifix, and fixing his eyes intentr
upon it, addressed his supplication to
leaven for the parden of his sins. The
attle meanwhile rolled gradually away
om the spot, and the prayers of the
ying man were undisturbed, except by.
ic roar of artillery. After St. Pol had
scored his retreat, and the fate jf 'Bayrffd
ccame known, both armias testified the
lost lively grief; for his great qiialilit s
rere appreciated by the enemy almost as
luch as by his own countrymen. The
larquis of Pescara who ran io the spot,
nd addressed him with affection, soon
erceived to remove him from where he
ly would be immediate death. He acordingly
had a tent pitched on the ground,
ent for surgeons to dress his wound, and,
t his request, called h priest, to whom
e might confess, and from whom he re
eived absolution. Immediately after this 1
eremony the constable entered the tent,
nd expressed, in kind and earnest terms,
he concern he felt to behold him in that ]
ondilion; to which he made this noble ]
eply:?"My Lord of Bourbon, it is not I

jars of the officers who surrounded Sim;

Upon the subject of agriculture we
hive not been backward in expressing
ourselves, as convenience allowed us.
At this time, particularly, it can hardly
be questioned by the merest novice, that
the need is very great of giving much at-,
tention to this strong pillar that supports*
(he common weal. Wo most highly respect
this source of the wealth and independence
of man, and would, by every
honest inducement, recommend it to the
wprkl. For
some years past, the spirit of spe-.
culation, and the hurry and turmoil of
that desire for the amassing of wealth in
a day which that mania produced, have
turned away from the sight and thought of
the many, the gentle but sure streams of
plenty that flow from this great blessing-:?
have crowded away from sight the loveliness
of that independence which the
thriving farmer feels, when he 'Contentplatfesthe
fruits of his healthful labor in
the waving fields before him?and feels
that, as he tends and sucdors nature in
theinfancy of the year, natme's God puts
the impress of his approbation "upon his
eflorta, by crowning them with success in

sale Of imported cattle which has been
lately advertised in the newspaper.^
Messrs. M. Thomas A Son being the auctioneers.
-Not less than three thousand

LATER FROM ENGLAND.
The packet ship Philadelphia, Capt.
Morgan, arrived yesterday and brought us
London papers to thelOlh August. The
political news-furnished by this arrival is
not of particular interest or importance.?
The commercial and monetary advices
are of more consequence, and are decidedly
of a favorable character. The London
and Liverpool 'cotton markets wore a
cheering aspect.
The Carlist expedition, which had advanced
within near three leagues of Ma
drid,liad retired to the Fonda del. Trimdad,
where it was or. the 12th. We also
learn that General Vigo, reinforced by a
brigade, occupied on the samo day Las
Noras, cohering the great road of the
Guadarairto and the Escurial; On the
evening vof the 12th the advanced guard
of Espartero entered the capital, where
the greatest enthusiasm reigned amongst
the militia,'which was preparing to march
against 'the 'enemy. But the arrival of
Espairtero was considered to render this .
useless. .
The Madrid Jodrnal the Espana, which
re-appeurcd on the 9th, states that the
Carlist forces in Segovia form a total of
4530 men (without artilery) consisting of
two Navarresse battallions, each 500
strong; two battalions from Guipusocoa,
each comprising 600 men; two battalions

the fifth battalion of Caslille, 500 strong;

and a corps from Arragon, composed of
100 infantry, and 180 cavalry.
The last accounts from Rome leave
little doubt of the appearance of the cholera
in that city. All strangers and most
of the wealthy inhabitants had fled. The
police had delivered upwards of 4000 1
passports. Albano and Frascati were \
crowded with fugitives from the immortal y
city. - \
