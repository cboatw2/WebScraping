REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE
4 JUDICIARY,
On to much if .'he Governor's Mcssagr, and the
Accompan'iinx Documents, as relates^ to the
Controversy between Arte York and Virginia,
and the Dili mi that subject, whicli were referred
to that Committer.
h* The Committee en the Judiciary, to whom
were referred so much of the Message of his
Excellency the Governor, as relates-to the Controversy
between the States of New York and
Virginia, with the Accompanying Documents,
and a B^l relative to the same subject, beg leave
to submit the following
REPOR T:
The subject which has engaged the deliberations
of your Committee, involves a grave and
delicate inquiry, as to the duties and rights of
the States of this Confederancy, under their
compact of union, and it has claimed their most
earnest consideration. Their inquiry, and the
Bill which has been committed to them, are
BUggested by the controversy that has unhappily
arisen between the authorities of Now York, and
of Virginia.
Three persons of color, having their domicile
in New York, and trading to Virginta, were, in
1839, charged with a violation of the criminal
law of that State, in having feloniously abducted
in their vessel on its departure, the 6lave of one
of her citizens. These felons having returned
to the State of New York, were formally demanded
by the Executive of Virginia, in pursuance
of the Constitution and laws of the United
States. i
Ir&The Executive of New York, waiving excep-.
tion to the regularity of demand, as well an objection
to the completeness of the evidence on :
which it was founded, declined to comply with j
the requisition, on the ground that the laws of
New York do not recognize the right of one
man to hold property in another: and that stealing
a slave in the Cominonwelth of Virginia, is
not an offence within the intendment of the
Constitution of the United States.
This unexpected and alarming determination
of the Executive of New York, and his
views of the constitutional obligations of a confederate
State, were communicated by the Execu-"
tive of Virginia to the General Assembly of that
Commonwealth. That departemnt of the government
o( Virginia, after mature and wise deliberation,
pronounced, in solemn resolutions, the refusal
of the Executive of New York to comply
with the requisition of the Executive of Virginia,
a "palpable and dangerous violation of the Constitution
and laws of the United States."' It announced
its well considered and earnest determination,
not to acquiesce in the course of the
Executive of New York, and to enact such legislation
as would suffice, to protect the property
. and rights of the citizens of Virginia.
The General Assembly of Viriginia requested
the Executive to renew his correspondence with
the Executive of New York, call upon him res|j
pectfully, to calmly review the grounds of his refusal,
and to present the subject to the Legislature
of-New York, by the official organ of that
State, and that body apprised that Virginia appealed
to its sense of justice and of duty to a co
State. How was that appeal regarded in the
response of New York! The Committee to
whom the subject had been confided, expressed ,!
its concurrence in the views of the Executive
Department, pronounced its construction of the
Federal Constitution, the only exposition of that ;
charter'which consists with the sovereignty of !
that State, and the rights of her citizens, and J
was djscharged from the further consideration (
of the subject.
Contemporaneous with this proceeding, was
the enactment of a law, bearing the specious but (
delusive title, "An Act to extend the right of (
trial by Jury;" an Act which is the most alarming
and dangerous from, in which fanatacism or j
folly has made its assaults on our domistic in- ,
' ntitution. (
This statute provides, that in proceedings to <
* xe-capture a fugitive from service or labor, the
claim to the service of 6uch alleged fugitive, his t
identity, and the fact of his escape from another <
State, shall be determined by a jury; that the I
State shall provide counsel for the slave, wit- 1
nesses attend in his behalf, and that the fees of 1
officers for summoning the jury, and the fees of <
the jurors and Court, shall, in all cases, be paid 1
by the claimant. It provides also, that if any t
Judge or other officer, shall issue a certificate for (
the removal from the State, of any fugitive from 1
labor, except in the manner prescribed by this i
otatute, he shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and i
be punished; and that an attempt to remove such I
fugitive, without the authority of law, shall in- I
/ lira fnrfpitnrp nf firp tinndrprl f?pllnr? tn tlip 1
" party aggrieved; that it shall constitute the crime ]
of kidnapping, punishable by imprisonment in
the State Prison, for a term not exceeding ten
years. It is a further provision of this statute,
that the writ of habeas corpus, to arrest the fugitive
from service, shall not be issued until delivery
to the officer to whom the application shall
be made of a bond with two sufficient sureties,
inhabitants and freeholders of that State, with
condition to pay the costs of the proceeding, and
two dollars weekly, for the support of the fugitive,
so long as he shall be detained by the proceeding
on habeas corpus; and that if the verdict
of the jury be against the claimant, he shall pay
, alj the.expenses of the proceeding, and shall pay
J ^0 -such fugitive one hundred dollars, and the
rdamages he may have sustained. It is not the
least obnoxious feature of this statute, that it
seeks to confine the adjudication of these ques
tions to juries, and to preclude the consideration
of them by the Judiciary of that State, as is
evinced by the imposition of restrictions on the
claimant's right of appeal, which greatly impair
that right, if they do not render it utterly nugato,ry.
Whether this course of the Executive of New
York, or the legislation of its General Assembly,
comports with the prescription-of right, and the
injunction of duty, that the Constitution 'so explicitly
enforces, in regard to our slave property,
let that charter, and the laws enacted in pursuance
of it, define.
;* The provision of the Constitution is, "that no
person held to service or labor in any one State,
under the laws thereof, escaping into another,
ehall, in consequence of any law or regulation
therein, be discharged from such service or la- j
bor, but shall be delivered up, on claim of the j
party, to whom such service or labor, but shall
due." By the Act of Congress, the master of any
fugitive slave, his agent or attorney, is authorizCA-70
nrwl tnlo him h^fnrp a Jtitlffo nf thn f^ir_
cuit or District Court of the United Slates, or
"before any State Magistrate, who, ou proof to
his satisfaction, by oral testimop}'* or affidavit
certified by a Magistrate of any State or Territory,
that the person so seized, is the slave of the
ft claimant, is authorized to give a certificate thereof,
which shall be a sufficient warrant for removal
of the slave to-the Slate from which he fled;

I der, or obstruct such claimant in seizing or arj
resting such fugitive slave.
I In this posture of the controversy, Virginia
( having exhausted the argument with New York,
and hopeless of the remedies which should be
1 found in the constitutional obligation and datiea
of a co-Slate, appeals to her sister States of the
south for counsel and co-operation. Standing
, on !ft*j out-posts 01 fsoumcrn insiiuiiioii*, uiui
! faithful sentinel announces the presence ot' clanger;
warns that a pommon foe is advancing, and
calls those who have a similar polity, to their
. defence. Her claim?her rights to lead in dej
fence or maintainanco of the right?f a confederate
State, or of Southern policy, has been nobly
' vindicated by the incidents of her past history.
Au ancient domestic instituton, cherished in
the hearts of the people of the South, the eradication
of which would demolish our whole system
of policy, domestic, social and political, has
j been assailed by methods most likely to be suc1
cessful. Is it a contest in which any Southern
! State without utter abandonment of honor and
of right, of policy and duty, can assume a pos tion
of neutrality] Let other States do as they
may, South Carolina has taken her stand in th's
great contest Her gauge of honor has been
given to her countrymen, and she is not of those
who know how to leave it unredeemed.
When the Federal Constitution was adopted
by the States, slavery existed with but few exceptions,
in them all. The right of property in
slaves, and the duty of all the confederate States
to respect that right in the citizens of each State,
are admitted and enforced by that Constitution.
Congress, in discharge of its duty, his enacted
laws provi ling sale-guards, and inculcating duties
in regard to this species of property. South
Carolina, as Virginia, has not seen nt to cnange
her policy, and abolish this species of property;
and she will permit no State authority to impair
its value or security: and like Virginia, she
here avows her unalterable purpose to protect
and defend it from all invasion and attack, come
from what source they may.
That the refusal of the Executive of New
York to comply with the demand of Virginia, is,
in the language of the Commonwelth, "a palpable
and dangerous vislation of the Constitution
and Laws of the United States," is a proposition
whic hadmits no debate. The pretension ofN. Y.,
that that State or any department of'her Government,
may look into the statute book of another
State, and pronounce upon the policy or the
morality of its legislation, when called to the
performance of a Constitutional duty, plainly
enjoined, is no less arrogant than it is violative of
her Federal obligations and plighted faith. The
statute, whose provisions have been recited, is
no less plainly and directly in contradiction of
the Constitution and Laws of the United States,
than is the refusal of the Executive department.
It is a distinct and unequivocal recognition of
the right of the master to hold property in his
slaves, and the correlative duty of States, into
which he has fled, but a mere mockery of both. I
The impediments and hindrance which it imposes
on the right to recapture slave within the
jurisdiction of New York, amount to a virtual
denial of the rights of the master, and withholding
his remedy. The laws of the United States
define a proceeding ministerial, summary, and
expeditious, which alone consists with the rights
of the master. The statute of New York, prescribes
magisterial inquiry, and dilatory, doubtful,
and vexations litigation, the hazards of which
are a denial of the remedy to the master, and jjnpunity
and protection to his Blave. And the
right of the master to seize and arrest his slave,
as well as the duty of the magistrate to issue
the certificate for removal, which are prescribed
by the laws of the United States, are made
high misdemeanors by the statute of New York.
If in the final determination of the Executive
af New York, and the dela/which attended his
:ommunications, in his correspondance with the
Executive of Virginia, a disregard of the obligations
of the Constitution, and a spirit inimical
to the slave property of the latter, be not apparjnt,
they are manifest in every feature of the
obnoxious Statute, which has been reviewed.
Interest, duty and honor, imperiously demand
:hat South Carolina announce to the authorities
>f New York, that so 6oon as .that State shall
ireak its solemn faith to Virginia 60 soon shall
je cancelled our constitutional obligations as to
ler. When a State shall have been disappointed
of those rights and remedies, for which stipuation
was made when the compact of Union was
idopted, then will the painful but imperative
luty of protecting her rights, in he own way,
lave been imposed upon her. This State havng
a common purpose, and common interest
tvith Virginia, to uphold the Federal Constitution,
by exacting compliance with its obligations,
is prepared to make common cause with
that commonwealth, in the maintenance of her
rights.
As the chief danger to our slave property
arises directly from the commercial intercourse,
which is permitted the citizens of States like
New York, having no similar interest, our enactments
should be specifically directed against the
means that have been resorted to, and are most
likely to be embraced by those who assail it.?
The peculiar character of that property, its immense
value, and the facility of abducting it, by
those who trade to our ports, are considerations
which should determine us to a course of
decisive and effectual legislation. These views
hailfe suggested to your Committee the expedient^'
of imposing such restrictions and obligations
upon those who would benefit by our commerce,
as will enforce the simple duty of not molia+Irts*

This species of legi:lation is commended by
your Committee, as not only free from well
founded c< nititutional objections, but as premising
the greatest security to us, which is probably
attainable.
If this species of legislation be supposed to
contravene the constitution or laws of the United
States, your Committee venture to believe
that the competency of the State to make it,
depends on principles neither of recent origin,
nor questionable acquaintance. The basis of
the whole doctrine of State Rights is the assumption,
that the Constitution of the United
States is a compact between sovereign States.?
From this postulate results the concession of
that Constitution, that the powers not delegated
to the United States, nor prohibited to the
States, are reserved to the States respectively,
or to the people. If the power delegated to tiie
United States be also prohibited to the States,
or in its nature and essence exclusive, it is not
pretended that it can be exercised by a State.?
But if the delegated power be not of category,
and be not expressly prohibited to the States, it
is a power which may be concurrently exercised
by the States, and the United States. The
ablest commentaton-, ana tne most aistinguished
jurists concede, that this is the just and accepted
construction of powers that are by the
States delegated to the United States. Of this
latter class is the power of the United States to
regulald commerce. ' ' ~ |
If then, the regulation of commerce be with/'
**" " " * * A
* ill . . .
in the competency of the States, as, well as of|
the United States, enquiry, arises, whether
ther is any law of the latter regulating com-merce,
to which the bill proposed by your Committee,
wouM'ibe repugnant. In determining
whether there would be collision between the
Bi'l proposed, and a law of Congress affecting
commerce, the question would be, whether
i?w* ? i ?v>,i
lwcic,io a luusuiuiiuiiai icpug iiaut y axiu in- \
compatibility, as mere inconvenience cannot by
implication, be permitted to divest a right of
J sovereignty. Occasional interference in the
j exercise of a concurrent jurisdiction, Js ,not
; enough to infer constitutional contradiction, and
the exclusion of State authority. The right of
the States to enact regulations that affect commerce,
and even impose restraints upon it,' is
illustrated by quarantine laws, port laws, and \
others 9f . like nature. But your Committee
are not apprised of any law of the United States,
regulating commerce, with which the Bill proposed
would be found to conflict
But the Bill proposed by your Committee, as
they conceive does not seek to regulate Com- ,
merce, and cannot be said, with propriety, to
affect it in anywise. It proposes a measure of
mere Municipal I'olice, a regulation of that t
species which no one has denied to the Stales.
But although it may be conceded,! that the
legislation proposed, does not contravene the 1
power of Congress, legitimately to regulate j
Commerce, yet it may be supposed, that it does
not consist with the privileges and immunities
that arc guarantied by the Federal Constitution,
to the citizens of a State, in all other States of
the Union. To this point, it will be permitted
your Committee, to address a brief argument
Without such provision in the Constitution of;
the united States, as that here alluded to, it
would have resulted from the Sovereignty of the
several States, that the citizens of each, would
bear to all the other Slates, the relation, of aliens,
and be subject to the inconveniences and
disabilities of that relation, and to confer upon
them, not citizenship itself, but the rights of
citizenship, was its purpose and object. But
the privileges and immunities contemplated,
are fundamental in their nature, and embrace,-,
in the language of an eminent jurist, "protection
by ihe Government, the enjoyment of* life
and liberty, with the right to acquire and possess
property of every kind, and to pursue .and I
attain happiness and safety, subject to such re- j
straints as the Government may justly prescribe
for the general good of the whole."
But your Committee, presume the question
is whether the citizens of each State, should
enjoy, in every other State the privileges and
immunities that are conferred on its own citizens.
If it be ascertained that a State may
bestow, on classes of its own citizens, privileges
and immunities that are not common to
the mass, then it is apprehended, the point is
made clear. The qualification of the Elective
Franchise which exists in some of the States,:
1 and once existed in this, the eligibility to office,!
chrr'.er laws, and the right to practice thelearr.ed
Drofessions. are rvamnW of the nower of a :
r ' 1 r .. ? "i
State to create diatinctions amongst her citizens,7
and many olhera might be embraced in the cnu- ;
merafion. The principle is that a State cannot ,
deprive the citizens of another State, of the
privileges and immunities of which it cannot
divest its own citizens. But discriminations between
citizens of a State, and those of other ;
Slates, are of frequent occurrence in all the .
States, and t he right to create them, is of un- j
questionable validity."
But the Bill proposed by your Committee, :
seeks merely to take from the citizens of other j
States, the immunity which is.not enjoyed by ,,
citizens of this State; and to impose upon them,
restrictions which arc endured by its own citizens.
1
South Carolina has, however, declared in the i
solemn form of Legi^itivc enactment her views ,
of these provisions oi the Constitution, as well 1
as of her pohce regulations, and as they have
not yet been impugned, your Committee take j'
leave to decline further vindication of them.? i?
By the Statute of 18313, any vessel from another ;)
State or foreign port, having on board any free
negroes or persons of color, as cooks, stewards, 1
mariners, or in any other capacity, is prohibited '
from entering any port or harbour of this State, ]
under sanctions which have been found adequate
to tho suppression of the evil that was. sought to '
be corrected. Let, then, those who it may concern
to know the policy of this State, and her '
interpretation of her rights as a member of these
united states, consult ncr statute isook, and it
they are wise, they will not offend against her
policy or her institutions.
In testimony of the high confidence which
South Carolina reposes in the Counsels of Virginia,
and a manifestation of her determination
to co-operate with that Commonwealth, and other
States, in maintaining, by all proper methods,
an iristititntiori in which she has a common interest,
your Committee beg leave to Report the
Bill referred to them, which is a copy of the Virginia

THE GRAND MILITARY RE\IEW.
Well?the grand Military Review at Columbia
is over, and contrary to the expectations of
its.opponents, who prophecied "great loss of life
and limb," and time, and money, and a thousand
other "ills that flesh is heir to," has passed off
without a single accident, & with the most perfect
success and eclat We were an eye-witness of
the spectacle, the most imposing of the kind we
ever saw, and shall not soon forget the emotions
that swelled our breast, as we looked along the
serried ranks of Carolina's chivalry?her armed
citizen soldiery, who are ever ready?"ay, ready"'
to* defend her, "animis ovibustne." from domps
tic aggression or foreign invasion.
One feeling seemed to animate the whole, from
the general officer to the private soldier, a feeling
of patriotic emulation, to shew that they had not
been regardless of their duty and responsibility,!
but conscious of the truth' of the latin adage,
"in pacepare helium," were prepared to defend
their rights and the liberties of their country
whenever theymightbe assailed.
We marched over with the "DeKalb Rifle
Guards;" to which corps We have the honor to j
belong, and did our limits permit, would take .
great pleasure in recording the many incidents !
that occurred on the route, and served to enliven ;
our bivouac, but must defer to some other occasion
the satisfaction of "fighting our battles over
again," &. content ourselveb here with the simple
mention that the expedition,' altogether, was an
exceedingly agreeable one, and far surpassed our
expectations, great as they were. The utmost
harmony, .cheerfulness, and "esprit du corps"
prevailed in cur company, and the "hurra for
Kershaw" or "DeKalb,": was alway sufficient"
fo inspire the weakest soldier with new strength,
when nearly exhausted by the fatigues of the
march. ;
This spirit of'gride and emulation was greatly
encouraged by the gallant conduct of our
Commanding Officer, ably sustained by his
subaltern officers, who marched at our head froirr
our rendezvous at Camden, to our Camp at
Columbia, and back, and shared every hardship
and fatigue that the privates in the ranks was
subjected to:" His constant attention to the
comfort of his men, and his spirit and firmness J
in opposing the division of his company in the i
formation of the Battalion on the day of the re-.
view, will ever be held in grateful remembrance. 1

the resolutions, and expressing hie, approbation
of the conduct and performances of the

needless for us to say that the letter and resolutions
will be duly appreciated by our corps?
who already most cordially reciprocate the
kindly feelings and respect that have been in so
jrateful a manner manifested towards them.

In conclusion, we have only to say that our
company returned in high spirits, with ranks as
full as when it started from home, and were escorted
into town by a corps of mounted citizens
under command of Capt Anckum of the
Kershaw Troop, and regaled with a1 handsome
entertainment at the "Troop Armory," highly
creditable to the liberal feelings and generous
spirit which always animates that gallant corps.

The Board-of officers appointed to award pre- _.
miums to the Cavalry and Infantry, for tfce best'
drilled Companies, take the occasion to esprese
the great gratification with which they haVo
witnessed the performances of the dagj It" is>?- .
with the utmost difficulty that they have Seen
able to come to a decision, so well h^s each company
acquitted itself. But being compelled to"
ociguiuijc uvips in Gd.cn anil 01 service^. iney

influenced by the slightest shade. And in awarding
to the Free Trade and State Rights Troop, "
and the College Cadets, the respective prizes,
they cannot do justice to theirown feeling1, without
expressing their high admiration of .the per- ?
formances of all, and their unanimous antf'sin- *
cere opinion, that it cannot be excelled, in this, ;
or any other country.
