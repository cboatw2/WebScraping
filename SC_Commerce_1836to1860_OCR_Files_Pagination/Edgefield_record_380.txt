fresh breeze sprung up, and was followed by a
very unusual coldness of temperature, that
greatly increased on Saturday night. and was
so severe. ryom that time till Wednesday, (,with
occasional rain.) as to render fires and over
coats not only confortable, but even necessary
It then moderated gradually, and has continned
to do so since, bitt W3 still very cold yester
day. It has been far the coldest period we re
collect to have ever experienced at this season
of the year. and more like November, or Febru

companied by hail and heavy rain, passed'
