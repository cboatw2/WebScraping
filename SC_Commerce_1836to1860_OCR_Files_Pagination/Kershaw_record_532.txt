, CONGRESS-SI-NATE.
. ._ Washington, June 21.
Mr. Clay introduced to-dey the reporon
the Secretary's projector a Fiscal Bank
* " *r~ ";i c;.iOJ Thpv rpsnlve it
oi me uimeu umivo. j
"all into a Bank of the United Slates, after
the model of the last.
The committee declared that the establishment
of a National Bank i? indispensable,
That it is to be rewarded as a settled
question that is is constitutional:
Thai the question of expediency would
not be discussed:
That it-is the deliberate opinion of the
* committee, that an immense majority of
the people are in favor of and call for a
United States Bank, and that it shall be
- established at liis special session:
That the committee determined to dis*
" ?i r~- ,u?
mi?s'aU experiment, mm im\e mi mc
sis of the new Fiscal Bank the last charter of
the Bank" of the United States.
That the capital shall consist of thirty
millions, which may be increased to fifty
millions:
That the dividends be limited to seven
per cent; if deficient one year, to be made
up by the surplus" of Subsequent years;
surplhs over seVcn per cent, to go to the
United States: : . *
Thatits loans and discounts shall not exceed
hs capital inure than seventy-five,
per ceitl:
That its affairs shall be open to the inspection
of the Secretary of the Treasu- 1
ry. Committees of Congress, and stock
holders: i
That when its notes exceed three times
the specie in its vaults, further bans shall
not be made:
That no paid officer of the Bank shall
receive accommodations by loans:
That embezzlement by any officer shall
be held as felony:
These, as far as we could catch them,
were the principal features of the report.
The repot repudiates altogether the two
features of the Bank introeuced by Mr.
Ewing to satisfy constitutions. The most
material is that which, in Mr. Ewing's
project, required tiic assent of the Slates
to the establishment of branches in them.
This, the report treats as yielding the question
of the constitutional power of Congress
to establish a National Bank. It
argues elaborately this question, and insists
on the establishment of branches
without the assent of the States, to be
essential to the system contemplated by
the committee. ^
Another point on which the report
wholly repudiates the Secretary's plan, is
that which proposes to establish the prin- a
cipal Bank in this District. So far from
doing this, the plan of the rpport takes f
Uie;whoJe banking- power out of the Lhs- c
t;?ct, not even permitting an officer of t
discount and deposite to exist within the e
District. It proposes to have a board of ?
directors as a board of control within the t
District; but no bank holding any part of a
the capital, or possessing any power to e
discount. This, so far from laying hold a
of the right of Congress to create a bank- f
ing corporation, as the root from which
tho States would draw branches, abjures t
altogether the authority of Congress over n
this District as furnishing constitutional b
power to establish a National Bank in the r
ten utiles to spread its branches over the n
Union, but, on the contrary, claims the t
power as applicable to the United States ^
only, by denying even a branch with bank- c
ing powers within the District. tl
These are two essentia] particulars, on p
which it is understood the President holds h
views diametrically opposite to the com- E
roitlee; and the committee have, notwith c
standing the adjuration of the National h
Intelligencer, boldly determined to push tl
the President to the wall, and make him o
surrender at discretion. It is said by some
of the friends of Mr. Clay, that it has
oeen ascertained in caucus me measure
.can be carried in Congress without regard
Mo the constitutional objections which Mr. d
JEwing's proposed plan was intended to remove.
We infer, therefore, that Mr. Clay 1
jsmvilling to try conclusions with the Presi- l
dent before the people, if he dare venture ?
on a veto. I
After Mr. Clay had read his report, Mr. 4
cCalhoun entered upon the discussion of <
'the Treasury report, which is made the s
"basis of the called session, and of the *
measures to which it is to give birth.? '
2Hr. Calhoun, in the most succinct and i
' -clearest manner, summed up the result of '
thajf.SdaXe paperfrom it own.figures, and '
proved conclusively that the mathematical
results were directly irt ''(he teeth of the
measures winch' the Secretary would tieduce
from them.
He showed lhat while the actual accounts
showed demonstrably that there
would, at the end, be a deficit in the
Treasury of less than two millions, the
Secretary, proposed to fund a debt, on lhat
pretext, of sixteen millions, which he
proposed to eke out to thirty-one millions,
on various schemes of policy, having no
reference to the wants of the Treasury.
He showed that while the pretence was
the deficit in the Treasury, as the groundwork
of a national debt, the Secretary
proposes to make a deficit by giving away
one of the great sources of revenue.
. He showed that while reform was recommended
hy those now in power, on
imputed waste of the public means by the
late Administration, which were nevertheless
found adequate, the reformers propose
to double the taxes, that they may
furnish a surplus out of the petiole's pockets,
to the proposed B.ifik,Vfhat it mav
tax them for the benefit, of the Bank oligarchy,
-hut of their means.
Mr- Calhoun here threw a powerful and
, *'
penetrating glance on the whole system
which again emerging out of the troubled
waters which tne moneyed influence had
so successfully troubled. He showed, in
all the associated propositions, the combination
with which Gen. Hamilton had
started to subvert the Democracy of the
Constitution, and found in its stead the
sovereignty which reigns in England, in
the shape of money, monopoly, and monarchy.
Mr. Calhoun entered into the philosophical
principles which discriminated a
Government based on the funding system?taxation
beyond the actual wants of
Government, and monopoly as a part of
that system?from a Government of the
people; and he made it manifest that the
worst and most oppressive tyranny may be
most effectually introduced in this way
under the forms of a Republic.
Mr. Calhoun sat down. Mr. Clay rose,
as he said, not to argue the question, but
to complain that others had argued the
matters arising on the report. lie said
it ivas a mere question of printing, and
should not have been discussed; and in
the course ofhis remarks, made some indecent
persona] allusion to Mr. Woodbury,
who, as being very round he inferred was
very windy, and with this sort of fling,
endeavored to escape from the necesily
of responding as head of the Finance
Committee, to the thorough exposure
which he had made of the false statements
and glaring imposture attempted by the
Secretary of the Trea jury. Neither Mr.
Clay, nor \Ir. Evans, (his colleague on the
Finance Committee.) could bring forward,
notwithstanding the days of vacation which
liave interposed, a single fact or explanalion
from the Treasury, to cover themanifold
errors and frauds exposed in the
jearching examinations of this extraordinary
rfmirt for the extraordinary session,
J - | U ~ -
made by Messrs. Wooilburv, Wright and
Calhoun. To Mr. Clay's remark, by whirh
be sought In excuse himself for not offering
some defence of that which was the
ground-work of all that he propngpd to do,
viz: that it was a mere question of printing;,
Mr. Calhoun replied by observing,
that it contained the proposals of all that
Congress was called to legislat^upon, and
therefore presented the gravest and most
important subjects of deliberation?that,
?s the King's speech in Parliament, which,
ivhen proposing innovations, was always
net with the most promptand liveliest distussion,
so the Treasury report on this
cession desired the most immediate and
he closest scrutiny of CongresB. If errors
were not exposed, the legislation
roposed to be founded upon it would
lecessarily be erroneous, the public mind
.bused, and the public interests sacrificed.
Mr. Woodbury, in reply to Mr. Clay,
lung back his taunts with spirit and sueess,
and made it apparent to the Senate
hat the Finance Committee had been drivn
to report against some of the extravagant
suggestions of that report, by omiting
them in the system they had devised,
nr! ihnt iIipv bad heen forced to Drive Ull
",M *"" *"w; " o? -r
ivery thing like defence of the statements
nd conclusions of this paper, after the
irst effort made by Mr. Evans to sustain it.
Mr. Buchannan rose before the vote was
aken, and said he had something to say
n the subject of this financial document,
nit as he found the Treasury report surendered?as
he found that the able and
nasterly expose of the lute Chancellor of
he Exchequer, (as Mr. Clay called Mr.
Wight) was not in the slightest degree
ontroverted by the new Chancellor of
he Exchequer(Mr. Evans, elevated to the
mst, by Mr. Clay's resignation of it in
aving nothing to say as the head of the
finance Committee,) he, Mr. Buchanan,
ould not be so cruel astoii.flict another
low on the unresisting. The printing ul
lie unfortunate Trersury paper was then

Correspondence of the Courier.
- Washington, June 20.
The Senate was not in session yesterr
lay.
^ In the House, Mr. Charles Brown, of
:*enn., between whom and Mr. Stanley.
here has been some bickering lately, rose
ad asked leave to make a personal ex*
ilanation. Several members cried out?
'no personal explanations here"?"go
?ut of the House with them"?"lei us
itop that now at the beginning of the seslion."
Some cried " leave;" but, finally,
.he House refused leave almost unanimously.
This would seem to show that
the sense of the House is opposed to per.
gonal altercations, and that hereafter they
will be discouraged.
A petition heretofore presented by Mr.
Furnace, Penn., praying a revision of
the tariff, with a view to protection, was
taken up. Mr. F. had moved to refer it
with instructions to the Committee on
Manufactures to report a bill, and commenced
a speech on the subject. A question
was then raised whether it was in order
under the new rule to discuss or consider
the subject of a protective tariff.?
The Speaker decided that, though the dislinciion
between a tariff of revenue and
one of protection was very nice, and
though they were sometimes blended,
yet it was clear that the President, in hid
message, referred to a tariff, solely for
revenue, and, therefore, the petition
must lie on the table. The subject was
laid on the table, yeas 130, hays 66?an
evidence that the subject of a protectivt
tariff will not be considered at this session

the country. The proposition will undoubtedly
be carried , into effect, and it
cannot fail to be productive of important'
results. Such investigations are prosecuted
frequently and with great success by
British Parliamentary Committees.
Mr. Adams presentada number of slavery
petitions, and stated their contents
severally. . A question arose whether these
petitions were to be returned to the member
presenting them. The Speaker decided
that the latter course must be pursued,
under the rule.
Mr. Clay, I learn, is ready to report a
bill establishing a Bank of the U.S., from
his Select Committee. The bill, to be reported,
as I understand, will vary essentially
from the project of the Secretary of
the Treasury. It mav provide for branch
es to be established in the States, "without
the assent of the States; and also allow
the Bank to deal in Fo'tign Exchanges.
This will render the bill more acceptable
to some, and less so to others.
A public meeting was held in this city,
last evening, by citizens of the State of
Pennsylvania, on the subject of making a
suitable provision for the family of the late
Gen. Harrison. It was the opinion of the '
meeting that the provision made by the
bill which has passed one House of Con*
gress is altogether inadequate; and that the
citizens of the (J. 8. ought, by private subscriptions,
to increase the sum to one hundred
thousand dollars. Measures were

DOCUMENT
FROM THE NAVY DEPARTMENT.
Navy Department, May 31, 1841.
Sir:?The appropriations made at the
last session of Congress will be found
amply sufficient to cover the expenditures
for the current year, nnder the several
heads of appropriation, unless it should
become necessary or be deemed proper
to assume another and lirger basis of ope*
rations than that on which the estimates
from the Department were founded.
The slate of the Navy Pension Fund
will require the immediate action of Con*
jjress. Under the operation of the act entilled
"An act for the more equitathle ad* {
ministration of the Nary Pension Fund," ,
that fund has been exhausted. It will be |
seen from the accompanying report of ,
the Commissioner of Pensions that there ,
will be required for the payment of navy ,
pensioners, on the 1st of July next, the |
sum of 888,706; and oa the 1st of Janu- ,
ary, 1842, the further sum of 869.000. j
In addition to these sums, about 86.000 j
will be required to pay arrears of pensions ^ j
which will probably be allowed oeiween j
July next and the 1st of January, making\
in the whole $103,709 06. To meet i
th^se payments, there is within the con- (
trol of the Department, the sum of $28,- ,
040; leaving a deficency of $135,666 66, ,
which the public faith requires should be
promptly supplied. ,
The sudden return of the Brandy-wine
seems to require some explanation.?
From the despatches sent to the Department
by Captain Bolton, of that ship, it
appears that the great excitement prevailing
in England in the early part of March
last, induced our Minister at that Court
to address a communication to Commodore
Hull, the officer commanding the United
Slates naval forces in the Mediterranean,
the result of which was, that the squadron.
then lying at Mahon, left the station
with a view to get out of that sea, ascertain
the true slate of things between the
United States and Great Britain andeither
resume their station or return home accord.
Thp Rrandv-wine OUt
sailing the Comndore, and Capt. Bolton
having received no information on his
voyage deemed satisfactory by him, he
returned to the United States.
Though it is presumed Congress will
scarcely be willing to to give attention to
general matters unconnected with the objects
for which the extraordinary session
of that body was convoked, yet recent
events induce me to bring to your notice,
with a view to the action of Congress,
two subjects as worthy of present consideration.
The first is the establishment of a
home squadron. While squadrons are
maintained in various parts of the world
for the preservation of ottr commerce,
our own shores have been left without any
adequate protection. Had a war with
Great Britain been the result, as was at
one time generally feared, of the subjects
of difficulty now in a course of adjustment
between thai. Power anil jhe United
Slates, not only' would our trade have
been liable to great interruption, and our
mechanics to great lossses abroad, but a
naval force, comparatively small, might,
on our very shores.have seized our merchant
ships and insulted our flag, without
suitable means of. resistance or immediate
ret tliaiion being at the command of the
Government. To guard against such a result?to
be ever ready to repel or prompt
ly 10 cnnsnze aggressi-ms upon uur own
shores, it is necessary that a powerful
squadron should be kept afloat at home.?
This measure is recommended by other
i considerations. There is no situation in
> which greater skill or seamanship can be
' exercised and acquired than on the coast
i of United States; and in no service would
1 our officers and seamen become more
i thoroughly initiated in all that is necessn
ry for the national defence and glory. In
. that service, aided by the coast survey
; now in progress, a thorough acquaintance
would be gained with our own seacoast,
? extensive and hitherto but imperfectly
> known?the various ports would be visited
?the bays, inlets and harbors carefully
examined?the uses of which eaclt could
F be made available during war, either for
escape, defence, or annoyance* be aseer. <
tained/and the confidence resulting from t
perfect knowledge would gtve to as, what t
we ought surely to possess, a decided ad- <
vantage over an enemy on our own shores. <
Should it be thought desirable that such a \
squadron be put in commission immediate* >j
ly. and kept constantly on duty, an addi* I
tional appropriation may be necessary; f
for the amount ofwhich, as well as the <
force deemed prdper to be employed, I j
beg to refer to the accompanying report <
on the subject, prepared under my direc* f
tion, by the Board of Navy Commissioners.
.]
The attention of Congress has been
heretofore earnestly invited to the state-j
of our ordnance stores, and I deem it ,
worthy of immediate consideration. A (
supply of suitable arms and munitions of ,
war isindispensableto the successful ope- a
ration of the bravest officers and men; j
and it cannot, from the nature of the case, (
be provided upon a sudden emergency.? i
Sailors may be hastly collected from our
commercial marine, ships may be purchas- f
ed, but ordinance cannot be supplied on i
such emergency, nor can some of the (
materials fur the preparation of amunition |
be procured cither bV purchase or manu
* - ' - *- -M U- .
facture. He tree! the ordinance snnuiu, uj .
a timely foresight, be provided in advance; h
and the-materials be secured, from which]]
a supply of ammunition can be speedily <
prepared. The accompanying report from i
the Board of Navy Commissioners shows
the amount of expenditure -which will be
required under this head. Should the object
be deemed of such importance and (
urgency as to require the immediate at- t
tention of Congress. I respectfully recoro- l
mend that ail approbation of one third of j
the estimated amount be now made. I
The opinion seems to have become gene* c
ral, as well in the service as in the nation r
at large, that a thorough reorganization ^
iNiaifv demanded bv considerations j
U| IIIV 41H ^ , r
connected with the defence and honor of 8
the country, and in this opinion I heartly (
concur. Yet I am fully aware that my ?
plan for this purpose should be the result e
of the most careful deliberation, and that s
it would be at once unwise and injurious |
to submit to Congress and the country ij
any proposed arrangements which should a
be liable to the charge of haste and incon- r
sideration. Deeply sensible, therefore, p
at once of the importance and difficulty ?
i)f the measure, 1 hare taken proper 0
steps to collect and avail myself of all the
results of experience and observation
from those whose opportunities have al> t|
lowed the means of knowledge, and their p
intelligence the ability to use them pro- 8l
Stably, and 1 entertain the hope of being h
able, before the next regular meeting of n
Congress, to submit for your considers* j,
lion a comprehensive and well digested ]{
system in the branch of the public service tl
committed to my charge. t<
