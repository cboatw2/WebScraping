I reqnest the favor Or you t0 publish il
your useful paper, the following extracta
from the'Minutes of the Edgefield Bap
tist Assosiation.
WM. B. JOHNSON.
The Committee, to whom were refer.
red the letters from the Churches, report:
1. On the subject of the leter from 'he
Edgefield. Church:
This Church states, that. notwithstand
ing the addition of several hutndred, since
the revivaliof 1831,hy which much wealth'
and niany young men oftalents. education,
and property have been brought itio the
Churches of the Association; yet the spir
ituality of the Churches has not been im
proved-the contributionl for benevolent
objects have been very little mobiplied
and the ministry diminished, rather than
augmented in numbers. .The Churches
request, that the Assoeitation will prayer
fully inquire into the cause and the remedy
-of this state of things.
Your Committee, having taken the sub
ject into serious consideration, are of opin
ion, that the cause of this state of tnings is
to be found in a departure of the Churches
from the scriptetal mtanner or spending the
Sabbath ; and in their failure to contrimte
fiberally for the support of the mi.dstry,
and the cause of God.
In velation to the first particular, your
Committee observe. that they regard the
command to keep the Sabbath Day holy,
its not relaxed at all under the Gospel Dis
pensation, bitt strengthened ; that on this
dav no work is allowed, except a work of
necessity,. such as preparing necessary
food, of mercy, such asa lifing an ox out
of the ditch; of piety, such as attending
uporn the duties of religion. They are ol
opinion, that the Churches are bound. in
imitation ofthe examples set in the New
Testament, to assemble as Churches on
every Lord's Day. anti to eugage in the
duties of reading the Scnptures, singing,
prayer, exercise of gifts, &c., for mutual
edification and growth in brotherly love,
and in tmie grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.
The primitive Churches contributed, on
this day. for the poor saints. These du
ties should not interfere with the public
preaching of the Gospel, there being sufli
cient time in the day for the whole. Now,
vour Committee ire of opinion, that as the
Churches do not asseibile statelly on eve
rv Lord's Day,in their appropriate charac
ter, for the observance of the duties as sta
ted nbovet hey are not acting con formahl,
to the Divine Will; that they are depriving
themselves of the spiritual privileges.which
they miglht enjoy on this day, the right ex
ercise of which would, under the Divine
blessing, increase their faith., and elevate
their spirituality. The general eust' m
of having preaching on one lord's Day itl
the month, or two at moet, has a tendencVy
to beget in the minds of the members a
disregard of the other Sabbaths, as day",
on which duty lays no claim for strict rc
ligious service, so that those days, it i
feared, arespent in indolence, travelling,
or visiting.
Your Committee recommend, that tih
Churches be advised to consider this sub
ject in a prayerful examination of the New
Testament, by which meani they may be
led to return to the observance of primit iv.
esampo. antd consecrate the Sabbath as a
day holy to the Lord; that ott each retur t
oft his holy season. they may be found as a
body. in the Sanctunary of God,to he ile-cbcd
with its spirnital privileges, to go forth
from them with renewed strength for the.
trials andm duties of the following week.
In relation to liberal contibutionsa. for
time support of the ministry atnd thme cause
of God, your Commnittee are of opinionl.
that there isno duty more explicitly coin
mnanded in the wor'd or God than the duty
of sneh cont ributions.
J. God has ordaitned, that they, that
preach the Gospel, shall live of the Gospel
that they, ih are taught in the word, shall
communicate to thema, that teach in all
good .thintgs. And this duty is cotmmanided
on the righteous principle, that the laborer
is wort hy of his hire.
The too general practice of withholding
a liberal supportfrom the Ministers of dhe
Gosnel, is a direct disobedience to the Di
vine command. It involves in it a mohbicg
of God, for as Godi calls te Ministers to
preach the Gospe-l. & give t beir time whol
Jvyto the work,snd lias required his~hurches
t'o provide for their support, when they
fail to obey this requirement, they oblige
the Ministers in engtage in some worldly
avocation for the -upport of themselves
and their famtilies; atnd thus God is robbed
o~f the serv ices of his Ministers. It involves
in it a robbing of the Mitnister; l'or when
his cornp~ensamtion is nmot adequate to his sup
port, lie tiust make ext raordinary efforts to
servo the Churches. For these extraor
dinary efforts, lie receives ino compensm
tion- It manunele's the officers of God's
host, and unfits them for ap)pearinig like
workmen that need not be ashamed. It
rohis the Churche' themselves, as it pre
ventS thme Ministers fr'om devoting them
selves to their work, in such manner as to
do the Churches the greatest good. It tnour
ishes the spirit of covetousnless, which is
idlolatry ; for 'his sin consists not only ini
grasping at more tihan ism law fui, bitt in re
taininig of that which is gotten, more than
is meet.
Your Committee recommend that the
Churches he entreated to regard this sub
ject with deep seriousness. To inquire if
they have fulfilled the Divine comntmand
in sustaining God's ministry conformably
to His will. That they he affectionately
entreated to retrace their steps,and to come
forth with their substance to honor the Lord
in the support of the Heaven-sent Bind
of Messengers to a guilty world. That
they unfetter the leaders of the Lord's host;
that they take elf their manacles, and set
them at liberty; that, like the Angel having
the everlasting Gospel to preach, they may
fly through the land' wvith th -glad tidings.
2. With referetnce to liberal contribtitons
for the spreamd of the Gospel, your Comn
mittee believe that, as the Lord's people
are workers together with him, atnd He' s
working to spread the Gospel through the!
earth, it is their du'vy to work also. God
is the AMighty Agent--they *ue the nstru
-ments. He gives them the' nme-as as ew
ards, w hich they are bound to. etnipl . mm.
obedience to His, wil.- The comma-d is.
.* As w e have opportunlity, let &s 4o~gob .
naa~ ml-nen, especially to theta abasme ofg
he household of faith. To do gooa and
o communicate, forgernot; f)r 'with such
aerifices God is well pleased. The liberal
oul desireth liberal things and by liberal
hings he shall stand." When the Apostles
went preachine the Gospel. abroad, they
vere bronaht on their way by 'he Churches.
Now, the practice of the Churches, in
ending up small contributions for the
ipread #)f the Gospel. is a departure from
[ospel requirement and primitive exam
ple.
Yonr Committee recommend that the
Churches be earnestly requested to open
heir hearts at the call of their Lord, that
their hands may extend the needful contri
Wtions, for Gol loveih a cheerful giver.
Your Committee helieve, that, so far as
means have any influence in preservine
he life of relition in the soul, these which
hey have now recommended, will, whet
piritually observed, he attended with hap.
py results; and that if the Churches, would
o into them for the coming year, their
letters will convey more pleasing intelli
gence at the next meeting of this Body.
and a better state of thines will be reported.
3. On the subject of the letter from the
Lallih-n's Mill Church, your Committee
recommend:
1. That this Body appoint the Second
Mond y in November, the next Month, in
eennexion with its Sister the Georgia Asso
iation, to be observed by the Churches in
its connexion. as a Day of Fasting, Humil.
i-ition, and Prayer. on account of the dis
ressing Dronuht throughout our Land
thesevere affliction with which the neigh
boring Towns of this and the State of
Georgia have been recently visited-and
the general state of Religionm declension.
And forastanch as the above causes are
general, your Cotnmittee would further re
commend, that your Body, respectrutily re
qu-st His Excellenry the Governor of this
State, to procla4in a Fast to be observed
throughout the State, on the above Day;
and that the Moderator he requested to
,orward these Resolutions to His Excel
lency as soon as practicable. All of whicth
is respectfully submitted.

25. The Committee on the State of Re
ligion, report:
That the increase in the number of p-r
sons admitted into fellowship during the
last year. is rather less than in the previots
year; whilst the contributions are larger.
Yel the greater number of the Churches
complain of leanness. The true state of
hings in the Body appears to be, that the
iritulity of the Churches is not mnnate
rially improved. The spirit of the world
has gai ed great aseendancy among the
nembers of the Churches, so that their
ittention is much etgaged about things oi
his present time. The number of Or
lained- Preacher% is eighteen,nnd of Licen
iemtes, four, together with several Benevo.
emt and Temperance Societies within the
nits .f the Body. On the whole, it ai
pears that there is great need of return
u-g to the spirit and practice of primitive
uges. W. H. JonsoN, Chair'n.
22. The Moderator also brought to thte
view of the Association, the Soutith Caro
lina Temperance Advocate, published
weekly in Columbia, at 2 50 per annurin,
is a paper alfordng effective aid in-the
cause of Temperance. and worthy of the
patronage of this Body. Whereupon,
Message of Gov. Polk.-The Message
uGoveraor Polk to the Legslature o
Tennessee, is a sensible one. We make
he following extract on the subject of tie
recent bank suspensionts in Tentnessee:
Amid whatever may have bieen the catuse
ft he suspcnsion of payments by the banks
sa theEast, it can furnish no sufficient
~round for the suspension of speciec paty
ment by our batnks so lontg as they hav~e
an ability to pay. Like inhvidtual debt
srs, they should infeet their liatbilities bhtn
estly and promptly as long as they atre a
le to pay. What is the etfect if:a contra
ry course be adopted! A few of thte bianks
tt the East suspend, andI represent to the
public that they are still sodvent, and. do
so, bot frotm necessity. hut to retain their
specie; and following their examtple, the
banks of the interior, which are also rep
resented to be solvent, sitspend also, not
because they are under the necessity to (d0
so, but simply because the Eastern banks
have suspended. So that the suspension
of the banks in a sirngle city wvhichl may
have indulged in excessive issues of batnk
paper and batnk credits, and thtus stimtula
ted and promoted over action in trade, or
wt hich may have ulterior objects in view,
is tade t'. operate as a suspension of pay.
mets by all the bainks of the cotuntry.
Surely if a batnk suispendt in Philadelphia,
ilis no reason for our bauks to follow the
examle, unless they are compelled by
their condition to do so.
The apprehension of the mrain of their
specie. catn he no stuslcietnt reason, for onie
of the conditions of their corporate privile
es is, that they shall keep themselves at
all timeis in a condition to meet their liambil
ities. Whent a suspiension of specie pay.
mets takes place by banks, their circula
tin itmmediately depreciates in value, andI
the loss falls, not on the banks but otn the
.eople. The labor of the country bears
the loss, whilst the banaks (luring a period
of suspension are often doitng their tmost
briable business. It wvas hoped that the
Bak of Tennessee, of whose ability to
pay specie no doubt is entertained, wouldl
continue to do so. She didl pay a tday af
ter te Union and Planter's banks had sius
pended; but I regret to say finally yielded
to the panic aroutnd her anid stopped, not
fro inability to pay, but as a measuire of
prudence. Her course is mneith to be re
gretted, and an early resumption is, it my
judgement, demanded by the interests of
the State. By maintaitiing a firm statid,
honestly meetitng all her engagements,atnd
at the satne time extending to her dlebtors
every possible itndutlgence comtpatile with
her safety, her character as a State i-'ati
'ution of undotubted credit will be main
tined, and, to the extent of her means to
furnish t, a round enrrency will be pre
served. In the future management of
ihat insttttion, owned as it is exclusively
by the Stateit should he a carditnal object,
constantly kept ini view, to confitne her op.
erations within her means, to meet he re

General Assemtably, In rcgard to the Wetio
which should be had in relation to them.
If it shall be ascertained that they have,
by a rospens;6n' or specie payments in
1837, or by the more recent suspenston,
or by any othey. act, subjected thetselves
to a forfeiture of their charters, and it shall
be deemed proper to continue ti-eir corpo
rate existence. it is suggested that the oc
casion may be a fit one to impose upon
them such additional restrctionis as the
public safety way require, and as expe
rience may have eown to be necessary
and proper, as conditions of the continn
ance of their corporate privileges. They
should be required at an early day, to be
fived by law, to resume specie payments,
and restricted from declaring any divi
lends to the stockholders for a period of at
least six months after their resumption.
It is believed that they are entirely sol
vent: and that they could conveniently
and safely make their meansavailable, to
resume payment at an early dny. and it is
not doubted that they would readily yield
their voluntary assent to such restrictions
as the-General Assembly may he oforuin
ton the interest of the State may require
to be imposed. If the conditions imposed
shall not be assented to, it will remain for
the General Assembly to considerwhat
fart-her proceedings it may be proper totin
stitute consistently with the provisions of
their charters.

To the people of South America the a

ment of Sweden first tablished this bank
in 1657. No stock w created ; but in
stead of this, three hundred thousandl spe
cie crowins were borrowed by the Govern
ment, and its capital, and promissory
notes were given for this mooney, payable
at sight to bearer,'and carrying interest.
What was thus borrowed ait fotur per ce-ut
was loatned at six. upon morteage, and
smneimnesupo~n pledges. The banuk-was
thus at once a bank of'eiren atioun, of loan,
andI of pledges or pawns. This last would
hie called, in Europe, a moat de piete, or
Lombard bhink. The admnin stra sonf of
his bank was condiuc ed with grerit fidhi

six cents value. More liberal in its dis

large advances.tif i's own paper to the
Govenimen and the nobility. In a short
time it had issued notes to the value of six
hundred millions ecet, or one hundred
njillion wollars.
This vast eirculation of paper money in
Sweden produced the same results which
a like circlation has caused in all other
enuliries. A tase fhr luxury and expense
diffused itself among aill classes of society:
the St ate increased iv: debt ; property hol

by banks or governients, having the
power of making unlimiitd asues of rag
money. These va -t issues of notes brought
with them their necessary mitendants, a
swift and ruinous depreciation olithe noteq,
and the total disappearanee of specie froin
circulation. The necessities ofirade re
quired the use of small money for change.
and as specie had diapperad, the bank
found it necessary to issue paper dIkets, of
very low denomination, which in the Uni
ted States are teried shin plasters. We
have thus arrived at that experience of the
ruinous efTects of paper money. which the
States of Europe have long si uce loarne d,

Thus is it in times of comimereial disease.
and thus we find it during the period of
suspended payments. The grand and
general remedy for these twinges and
siastns is a prompt return to a better con

AGRICULTUltAL CONVENTION.
The Agricultural Convention asseinliled i
at Columbia, on Monday last. We keew y
not what thi.* body may do, but in a
pamphlet which has recently Ieen ptm, -
lished, several things have been rcomt
mended for its consideration. The wri
ter proposes, that it should recommend to i
the Legislauire, the appointment of a Ge- I
ological Surveyor for the State, the estab- A
lishmetst of an Agricultural Professorship,
and of an Agricultural School. Se eral
of the Sti es have thought proper to ap
point Surveyirt. Among them, may he -
numbered M assaclusetts and Virginia.
The latter State is said to have reaped
great advantages from the labors of a gen
tleman, Professor Rogers, highly d*tin
guished in the walks of Science, whom
she appninted for this purpose. Of the
utility of these surveys, there ean he no
question. By the v. the constituent por

tny of mantires to them, and mines of
wealth which have lain hiddeis in the bo.

A champion of the Gin Sho"p. under the
nposing nmiie of "Cato," has underta.
ten. in the Charleston Courier, to etilight.
:n the good people of South Carolina,
)pon their constitutional rights and privi
eges. IHe has very learnedly demonstra
ed, in his own opinion, that the existence
if the "dram shop" is itiseperable from
-ivil liberty. Ile spouts in Kings Cam
iyses' vein aibout * crippled conetitutions,"
Inl - polated hearth's," and with the like
ile drivel, concludes by delivering a
post dolorous Jeremiad. upon the pros
>evt of having the "poor people yoked by
heir neeks." After involving himselfaind
lie question in visible darkiness, he deals
ibott him. with a most reckless haud, all
he cant slang, about the rights of ihe
ieople, which is every day retailed in the
mr room, along with the liquor. Wheth
r this writer is, hienelf. able to compre
end the question. and like some desiening
eaingo ine, is pandering It the base pas
ions of a besotted mob, or whether his ie
toronce is unfeined-whether it is his
auh or his misfortute, is not for me to de
ermtine. I have only to do with his atrgu
etnts--to expose them in their naked
mhecility anid deformtity, and to show
Vat .-Cato" himself is grossly ignorant
'f the subject, upon whieb lie very modest
!qtiundertakes to lecture the L egislature of
S. Carolinia.
"Cato" enters into a very elaborate ar
pimenit to prove, what any school hiey
m-ld have told hinm, namely, that it e
States haos granted to Congress the right so
regulate cotnmerce'. And he very tri
um~tphntly demtonstrates, that the 8th see
lion of the first article of the Constitution,
wicih gratnss the power to Congress, is
,ctuallt contained in the C'onstitution!
Now itis sonmewhiat ~nforsinare for -Cato'
ail she drm shops, that this most excel
lent argumsent lhas noth'ing at all to dho
with the question before the people.
lis attempt to prove, that this State r'an
tot surpress~ dratm shops, hecennse Connresq
is the right to regulnte ci non crce, is
ike the argumetnt wihiich piroved.--that

te ltme enough to consitder'* Cat's'~ rgu
rmetts. At present T shall consider the
ower of the Legislature to regulate the
tile of ardent spirits-the question upon
which it will be called t act.
"Cato" afirms. "that there is no eonsti
tutional right to prohibit the sale and conl
mmsp:ion of any article of commerce in
which there is capital and labor, in this
State; andI if there he ino right to prchibit,
t is a flagrant usurpation of our privileges
to get rid of conutitutional impediments,
by the evasion of a tax."' Hire thuen, we
ave the constitutional nrgument as put
rorth by the dlram shops. "Ca-o" with
nore zeal thiant undrerstanding, he 1tdly as
ens, that the State has noat the right totar,,
a prohibition the trade in ardent spirits.
Let us candidly xamnine this aren:#at,
tand see how it wi I hear the test oif scri ti

-y is, hna~ the State any right to tatx the
