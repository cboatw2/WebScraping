its duties,) left not. a doubt ou that point.
It indeed, as wel) as avowed it, by declar
ing that Great Britain. desired to see sla
very abolishedin Texas and throughout.
thesworld, and that she was using constant
efTrts to effect it, and by inference, tltat
she. wa's urging her influe- ce and diplo
macy with Mexico. to agree to recognize
the independence .of Texas, on condition
that she-should abolish slavery.
I saw in this declaration, thus formally
made to our government,- a confirmation
of what I believed to be her. scheme of
- policy in connection with Texas, from
other but less conclusive evidence in my
possession.. I also saw clearly, that whe
ther it should succeed or not, depeods on
the fact whether. Texas should or should
not be annexed; and that if it succeeded,
its inevitable consequences would be the
final consummation of her grent atid deep
design, to be followed by the desolation of
2'- the south, the prostration of the commerce
and prosperity of the continent, with a
.nonopoly on her part of the great tropi
cal products of sugar, coffee, rico, tobacco
and cotton, which are almost exclusively,
as far as this continent is concerned, the
result of.slave labor.
Seeing all this, the question presented
to me was, hof shalt the declaration of
the British Govertnient be met ? Shall
i be silently passed over, leaving annexa
tion to hie urged on other and different
groutids,. or shall it;be directly and boldly
met and exposed? t
It issuitin my nature to hesitate between
such alternative. My conviction'is deep;
that truth, honesty and plain dealing is the
true policy on all occasions in the manage
meat of public affairs, including diplomat
ic ; and I resolved, without hesitation, to
take them as my.guides on this memorable
occasion. - The defeat of this deep laid
scheme,; the success of .annexation, (as
may now be almost certainly said) the
vindicationof the great institution on which
- our safety depends, and the rescue, of the
commerce of the continent from the grasp
of commercial tnonoply, have been the
result, and I may add, as far as I am indi
vidually concerned, your approbation, that
of the meeting you represent, and if I may
judge from indications,nearly of the whole
country now, of my course.
]Put at the time the approbation was not
so unanimous. Denunciation then, loud'
and deep, fell on my head.
I was charged with introducing a- new
local subject of little importance into the
Texan isste, with the base design of inju
ring the prospect of one of the presidential
candidates, and of dissolving the Union 1
And many, who did not go so far, even
southern men whose all was at stake,
thought that I acted injudiciously in irtro
ducing the slave question and giving it
such prominence ; that it was calculated-to
have a bad party effect and to drive off
some ofthe party who nere not sound. on
the subject o: abolition, or who desired to
obtain the. votes of abulitionists.-But I
pass them by without remark or comment
now, when time and experience and the
approbation of the country sanction the
w-isdom of the course I adopted.
The absorbing character of the negotia
tion in reference to Texas, did not so en
gross my attention as to neglect that of
Oregon. As soon as the former was
sufliiently despatched and the business of
the department brought up, I entered on
that. I left it in an unfinished state; and
its it is still pending, I amnt at liberty to
ypeak of~ the course I took in reference to
ii'; hut I trast, when it comes to he male
public, it will not be less successfutl in
meeting yottr approbation and that of the
country geneirally. It is a subject not
without great difliculties ; and 1 feel assu
r ed I sihall lbe ptardonecd for espressintg a
hiopie thait it may be coniducted by thtose' to
whose bands it is enutusted so to finish The
negomtiationt, as to bring it to a successful
antd satisfactory termination, arid thus
avoidl an a ppeal to arms. Neither country
can possibly gain atny thing by sutch an
'tippeal, or can possibly desire it if it can
be honorably avoidgd.
In ctoclusion, I assure you and through
you those you represent. thati it would af
ford1 me great pileasure to partake of the
pubilic dlinner you have tendered me in their
tnime, and of forming the perstonal ne
quiiatine of my nttmerous friends ini your
city ; btui it is nttr now in my power. It is
probable, however, that I shall visit my
son a Ito resides in your State some time
next autumn; tntd in that event, I will
maoke it a point to visit - 1l0bile, whetn I
shall be haipp~y to meet you aod all my
friends..

inoliter Tragical 'dfdir.-From the
-Marengo (Ala.) Pamrimot; we learn of an
other bloody affair which occurred in lDe
m topolis a fewv days aro The paper states
that as Mr Mayfield,:.in company with
his wife and daughter, was returnmng home
from church, he was attacked from behind
by Theophilus Fisher, who struck him
seve'ral blows, and sucededed ii, hringiuig'
"him almost to the ground;' Mayfield re
covered however, and as he arose, stabbed
Fisher in the right sIde, the knife penetra
ting the right lobe of thbe lungs ; in hereupon
Fisher drew a pistol, and attemapted to fire
upon Mayfield, but was prevented by the
.crowd whieli had by this time assembled.
Fisher died next evetning about sunset,
and Mayfield immediately -surrendered
himself into the custody of the otlicers of
justice. An inqnest wvas held over the
.body of the deceased, and the verdict of
the jury was as follows:-"The deceased
came to his death by a wound intflicted
by the hand of B. M. Mayfield, in neces
esary self-defence."
Distress in Mr Clay's -Family.-We
' are deeply pained on learnuing from a friend
wvho has just returned from Lexington,
Ky., that the domestic afficetion,- of the

lately been greatly added to. by his young
est son's becoming deranged. This makes
the secotnd son that is now an inmate of
the Lunatic Asyln in; and wte deeply sym
pathise with both Mr. Clay and his wife in
this-the hour of their distress. We are
also informed from the same' source, that
Mr. Clay has become a communicant in
the E piscopal Church in Lexington.-Al

effect of applying Guano as a manure.
A cutting from an original plant, grown in

produced a stem and leaves at least twice
the ,ize of the parent plant. which had ob

lt is perhaps' not generally -known that
black pepper, (not rel) is a poison for
many insects- The followirt; simple mix
ture is the best des:roper of the common
house fly :-Take equal portions of fine
black pepper, fresh ground, and sugar, say
enough of each to cover a ten cent piece ;
moisten and mix well with a spoonful of
milk, (a little cream is better,) keep that
in your room and you will keep down the
flies. One advantage over other poisons
is, that it injures nothing else; and another
that the flies seek the air and never die int
the room-the- wvindows being open.

The papers say that tnot. less thatn 1200

To the Physicians of Edgeficld
District.
GEleTLE3EN:-Believing that the honor and
dignity o' our profession may be seriusly pf
fected, and is even already much injured, par
tcularly in the country, by a want of that uni
formity of conduct among the members of the
profession. which is.so essential to its main
tenance: and lfeling it to be the dtty of the
members of the profession to remove as far as
possible.any cause which have a tendency to
detract from the respectability, honor and dig.
nity of that profession, we feel ourselves sus
tained in calling the attention of the Physicians
of Edgefield District, at least to the considcra
tion of a subject which must be looked upon as
one of the great causes in producing the e -
fects above alluded to-the want of a regular
fee bill, a uniformtsystem of' charges, by which
,ll shall be governed.
The dignity, the respectability aid the honor
of the profession require the Adoption of such
a system, and it is die the people, that a fee
bill be adopted in accordance n ith the times.
We. therefore, call on the practising Physi
cians of Edgefield District, to meet at Edge
field Court Honse,on the first Monday in July
next, at 2 o'clock, P. M , on that day to assemble
together in some suitable room, and adopt
such a bill of charges as the times and circum
stances require.
After which, the meeting might take into
consideration other subjects. And tne which
will be well worthy of its consideration is.
the propriety of establishing a Medical Society
or Societies in Edgefield District. The utility
of which, if' properly coonducted. both as re
gards advancing the science of Medicine and
the benefits to the community, must be ac
knowledeced by all.
Ve flatter ourselves that the importance of
the subjects will be sufficient to iudnce every
member of the profession in our District to
take a deep interest in the meettng, pnd to at
tend, prepared for the transaction of tie busi
ness above mentioned.
