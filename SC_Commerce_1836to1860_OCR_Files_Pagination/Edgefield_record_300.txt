Miscellaneous.
To the Editor of the South Carolinian:
Sia :-The numerous and incessant de
nu'neiations, to which the " Cotton Circu
lar" has been exposed, ever smce its pub
lication, and the tainrepresentations in
which those denunciations seei to have
originated, render it in some sort, my duty
to explain the true o;.ject of that paper. so
far as I understand it, and to state, more
over, the exact relation i bear to it.
While remaining a few days in New
York, on my return from Europe, I met
with two of my friends, wno were cotton
plantera ; andi the extraordinary and arti
ficial state of the cotton trade, and its con
sequent exposure to the mercy of adverse
coint.inations, on the other side of the wa
ter, and of every great pressure in the no
ney narkets, of either 'ondon or New
York, becamne the subjectoffrequent con
versation between us. We concurred
fully in certain leading features of a plan
ifr restoring the trade in that staple, which
is the actual currency of our foreign co:,
merce, to something like the stability and
uniformity which should belong to an arti
cle perforaing a function so highly itipor
tout-a plan which would, at the same
time, promote the interest of the cotton
Planters, give to our soutlern banks that
control over the foreign exchanges, that
naturally and rightfully belongs to the
States, which produce the staple upon
which, nearly all the foreign l-ills of the
United States are drawn; and by this
means give a powerful aid, to the direct
trade of importation and exportation,
-through our southern cities, in which all
parties among us take so deep an interest.
I will now very briefly, state the out
lines of the plan, to which I have allued,
-so far as my views add opinious arc in
volved in it.
I propose that the existing banks, in the
rotton growing States, should discount the
votes of cottot planters ani others, upon
the security of coUon, actually deposited
in a neigboring warehouse, every paper
being put in possession of the bank, ueCPs
--Gary to the completeness and securi:v ofits
lien. That the notes should tie discount
ad at 90 days, with an understandmu, that
- if the proprietor of tie cottos determined
,ot to have it shipped to Europe in that
time, the note must be punctually paid at
its maturity, or the baik be aihorized to
have the cotton sold, holding the surplus,
-after paying the note, as a deposite to the
-credit of the proprietor.
But if the proprietor determined to ship
bis cotton, which i, is poresumned would te
the case, in most in-i anes, the bank
should be authorized. at the end of the 90
days, to draw a ninety-days tsill upon Ei
gope against the cotton. having been at
the time of the shipment, placed in posscs
sionofall the docuitents necessary to iake
that authority effective, the planter or
proprietor, retaining the control over the
times and terms of selli .g the cotton, pro
vided it be sold in time to discharge the
bill drawn against it, at its tnaturity.
This is the whole sum anu substance of
the plan, so far as I have had any agency
in it. In settingdown 9 dilays as the time
,that the notes discounted, and bill- drawn,
-should have to run. I have merely adopted
what I suppose would be convenient lie
nods, subject of course to such moditfia
tions as experience tnay suggest.
This is a very i.imple plan, entirely un
incumbered with new or experimental ma
-chinery ; and though it aims to work no
miracles, I will point out in a few words,
what Iconsider the plain results and obvi
cue benefits it woui ptotduce, to our baniks,
and our cotton planters, and our mter
ebants.
It would place our banks on a more so
- . ild foundaion than any other banks in the
United Sttecs, by giv'ing themt a const ant
eupply of foreign exchantnge. For exam
ple,, I send my cotton to Charleston, nt anty
cotnvenienit periodls. I apply to onie ot
our banks, to discount my note at 90 (lays,
upon the sectnrity of that portion of tmy
.cotton actually in the warehotuse, instead
of personal secturit y; the batik having the
cotton inspected, its current value esti
mated by conmpetenit jutdges, and discount
ing my note for such: an amount as will
render the transaction perfectly safe. At
the end of the90 dlays, I pay off tly note,
.not in the bills of the bank itself, which it
oannot convert into specie, lint in an utn
<qnestionable bill of exchatnge on London,
which I authorize it to draw, payable 90
days after sight, on Baring, Brothers &
Co., with whose hotuse in Liverpool, i have
in the mean time, cansed my cottont to be
deposited, subject to the lien of the banik.
Now, every well-informed bainker knows
that, a bill of exchange upon Lonidotn,is to
o hank here, precisely eqtuivalent to so
much specie in its vatults. For all prac
* tical purposes, therefore, I pay off my no
- to the bank in spiecie. it follows that a
bank, that would go largely into this busi
ness, would have a constant supply of
aterling exchange, of the most uinquestioni
able kind, that would renider it perfectly
impregnable. So much for the immediate
benefits this plan would confer on our
southern banks.
The benefits which the planter would
derive frotm it would lie, in the first pilace,
the prompt conversioni of a large proper
tion of his cotton into cash, as soon as it
reached the market, wvithout selling it, and
without asking any costly favors of his
factor or any body else ; for the transaction
wit h the banic, however, beneficial to the
planter, would he conferring a favor in
stead of receiving it. In the next place,
the planter-wouldI have six months and a
half. or seven months, from the time he
received the advance upon his cotton, to
avail himself of any favorable changes in
the market, if lie should choose to ship it
.to Etirope. A bill drawti on England at
.90 days 'ight, could never be presetnted in
less uhian 15 days, and often in not less than
20 days, after Its sale here; so that this
much 'vould) be added to the two fixed pe
riods of 90 days each, which the note and
the hill had to run
But atnother advantagze wouild result o
the planter, from the proaposed plan, less
direct, but not le~s important-an advatin
tage, in ,vhich every clans, oni both sidesi
of thye-water. woutld l:irgely participnte.
That' advantage is, its -trong tendency to*
preventthe extravagatnt fluctuations in the
price of cotton, ehave heretofore expe
- tienced, so ruittous to nll coticerned, by
A .kin= the entin trde to a very great ex

have in iis possession cotiU to uite aimouit

than th' irigi-inat hank loan ot' $20,000.
While trade is s'emingly prospierous, Illo

speculators and hroier..i i.uionitedly tends
to enhmice the price B i tle minent

I Xras very much surprised, therefore,
when I saw Iihai your ilt I igent correspon

ly mistook the tmatter, ;is to a-cribe t) the

No bankimg operations can be more
legitimate than that proposed by thet,

views of our s s:emii of' miankitig, how is it
that 3011 sigiedi a paper proposmig the is

edl to the Circular, by a frietit, seveial
weeks after I left New York, upon the
implied authority, derived fron a very
stroug and iinniate personal friendshtjy,
and fromt my known concurrence in the
general principles and objIect< developed in
that document. The issue of pot notes,
he no (ouIlt constideretl a matter of de
tail, which the Convention wouhld adopt
or reject as its delbberate judgment
should dictate. I amt very sorry it was
suggested in the Circular, as it thas given
rise to nmuchi of the oppost:ion to a call ot
a Convention. andt is a mieasture to which I
houtl, us at present advised, be decidedly
opposed. 1 (do nlot think the proposed
post notes could possibly be made an an

cot ton planter, I amf sore they wotld not

As to the sixty milliont cotton Batik,
whichi stome lively iimaginatiion has foistid
into the Circulaer, the people of douth
Carolina do not require to be inf'ormied,
that I iim the v'ery last mani ini ihe State,
who would give it the slightest counte
uance. T1htey cannot but ricolteci, that in
uy last aninuitl miessae-as Chief' Magis
rate of' South Carolina, I used the veryv
trnlgest latnguage in opp~osit~tin to the
charterinlg of' a gigantic Biiak then purojec'
ted, urgiag int oppiositioln iio it ithe general
reduntdaney of1 the curren'cly, aw'l predtitng
the comm aercial expilosiont which took place
a few months allerwards, to those whoE
were utterly deaf to the wurnjing. That
bnk wvas chartered by an overwhelming
majority ; those who are nowv for a uinited
States Bank, and those w bho are for a Sub
Treasury systemn,seeming to vie with each
>ther, wvhoshiould contribute most, to swell
the torret in its favor. white I should have
stood "solitary and'alone," if the vetnera
ble Judge Colcock, whose loss South Car'
lia has mucli cause to dephore, and a few
athers bad Dot stood firmly by my side.
It vould he extraordinary indeed, if under
these circumstaices, I should lbe in favor
>fsuch a hank as haus been recently sug
gested. I ami one of those who believe,
hat the issue of one hundred muilliotis of
bank paper, in addition to abe present cir
'ulation, so far hromi adding one cent to the
wealth or capital of' the country, would be
the greatest evil that could be inflicted on
it; operating as an insidious transfer of'
that sum, from the pockets of the people at
large. to the corporation issuing the paper.
I believe outr currency is now redundant,
and that no remedy can ever cure its dis
eased condition, wshether it be the Sub.
Treasury schemte, or national hunk that
does rnot reduce our bank circulation to its
proper limits. TIo suppose, as multitudes
vainly do, that it is within the conipass

the planters constitute the first estate in the

Death of Colonel Abraham Blanding.
The Charleston Coorier, of the 23d of
September. says-" It is vtiih deep regret
rthat we record the death of this eminent
ditizen, who breathed his last, at Sulli
von's Island, on Friday night last. Col.
Blanding was a native of New England,
bhut in caHy life. becane a settled resident
of ibis State, where he formed a matri
monial conuexion with one of our most re
spectable families, and was long justly
esteeied as one of our most distinguished
e
jurists and useful citizens. He was iden
tified with all our great works of public
improvement, for which his aid was always
invoked, and always promptly rendered;
in matters of law, he was consulted as al
most an oracle; in finance, he was deeply
versed; aud to every pursuit and enter
prize in which he embarked, he contri
huted all the resources of a stoug and well
informed mind, a warm zeal, and an un
tirine industry. EUinen in intellectual
endowmeats, ditinguished fir public spirit
nod practical usefulness, he was also en
deared to society by his private virtues.
Until the organiz;'tion of the South West
er Railroad Bank, last winter, he resided
at Columbia. in this State, where he was
universally regarded as a public benefac
tor ; but having bedn elected President of
that important monied institution, he then
removed with his family to thiscity. Ar.
ter the breaking out of the stranger's fever,
thi summer, he took tip his residenco
temporarily on Sullivan's island, only oc
easinailly comin up to the city during the
dav, to attend to his ofticial duties. His
prudeti prncition, however, proved un
availing atid he has fallen a victem to the
prevailine epidemic. His funeral service
was attendid, on Saturdny afternoon last,
nt the Circular C'utreh, in this city, by his
sorrotiing ronniiexions. and friend;, and

death of ntt a man, our city anud state
have sustained a.lows not easily repaired."
