?A lecture delivered before the .Edgefield
Philosopical and Agricultu-al Society
of Edgefield, on the subject of "Vegeta
ble Physiolngy," by.J.as. TranyX, Esq.
on the Ist. Juue,1O, and published by
request of the Society.
The. present is an age of practical philoso
phy; at-age in.wbich our race are more engag
red in deducing from actual experiments, useful
improvements in the arts, than in estab!ishing
splendid theories on merely plausible hypothe
.ses. In this respect, our own country has ad'
vanced more rapidly perhaps than any other,
not on account of super-ior powers ofphilosophi
cal research, but because our, institutions of
government afford to its citizens the most un.
limited scope foi practical industry. and.proim
ise the most generous rewards to success in
.,every department of mechanical, commercial,
and agiricultural enterprize.
It is a-common error 1 fear, that the-sentence
of the Almighty upon our race, "In the sweat
6fthy face thou shalt eat bread" is ca!culated to
impress upon the pursuit of agricunture the
stamp of inferiority, when compared with oth
er employments. But in alludingto this error,
we are reminded that the tilling of the earth is
..a pursuit of divine appointment; is the most an
rcient ofall pursuits; and as I firmly believe, a
pursuit most happily illustrating the wiseomu and
.-goodness of that Being from hoin cometh
-every blessing.
'The cultivation of the soil is the primary
source from which all classesof civilizedtnu
'derive their subsistence; and the products of
the earth, whether they be sponttaneous, or the
reward of man's industry and-slill, either di.
rectly or indirecily, furnish suabsistance 4o the
whole animal kingdom: for whethei the aninml
be omnivorous, carnivorous, or granini vorous,
the earth, the great mother of all vegemahle
matter, has yielded the first fruits, and in the
language of an inspi e.! tmtan, all flesh is grass.
It may therefore be emphatically said of tle
vegetable kingdom that, as it is the inexhantsti
ble store house from which all animated nature
draw their supplies, so is it the wost ilmportant
field for. philosophical enquiry in reference to
the means -of supplyhizg.the wants, and con
tributing to the wealth and lumiry. of man.
As.a metnber of a connuniiy.whoire be
-ginning to appreciate the value of agricultural
knowledge, I feel proud that the people of our
State are becoming daily more interested inl the
-establishmert of Societies, and the diffusing of
correct information throutgh the medinin of
papers and periodicals. The day is not far dis
tant, when S. Carolina must,:in a great mInCs
ure, ab.andon .-the ptodigal etiture of her great
staple,.cotton, and turn her atttention to the
more frugal but less lucrative business of farm.
.ing. As a preliminary step to this change of
pursuit, and diversion of capital into comnpar
atively now -channels, it is of the last impor.
tance that those who live by the cultivation of
-the soil, should feel proutd of-the employment
'for its own sake, and that they should attach to
the science of agriculture equal consequence,
and regard it as a busitiess of eqnal dignity and
honor with what are usually styled tle learned
professions of law and medicine. This object,
the consummation of which isso devoutly to be
wished; canl only be accomplished by introdu
cing thescience of Agriculture into our schools
and colleges by elementary books, illustrated
and enforced by lectures frotn scientific ten;
and thus elevating itto its proper rank, by plac
ing it in company with the sciences of chemis
.ty and geology, its twin sisters.
- The puryose of the fhiloropical Scciety of
Edgefield -in its original formation, was trot, I
npprehend confined to the investigation of titose
branches-of science embraced in thte defiiion
cCfmental philosophy or metaphysics; but it was
-intended to comprehend the ctthivation of an ac
quaintance,with those arts antd sciencesitt wht ich
as individuals antd commutnities, we atre every
day contcerned. Wlithi thte view therefore of
recognlizing the principle of equtality-, atnd of
acknowledgitr thte hight claims wvhich the
study of the laws, anud the investigation of the
phenomena of the vegetable kingd om, htave up
on those engaged in thte actjpusitioni of useful
knowledge;our society htas resolved so to change
k~s name, as expressly to emubracejin its obects,
+hbe scienee of Agriculture, and has assigned for
this evening's lectture, the subject of "vegetable
physio'ogy."
In discu uittg a subaject so vast and cotmpre
liensive in .its relatio.us, and so importatit aznd
nmul-ifariouts in its resu!-ts, nothting more eatt be
attemp~ted in a single lecture, than a brief tno
tice of some of the tmost promitnetnt facts. and a
concise illustration of some of the most obviotns
principlesof the scietnce.
- Phtysidlogists have assigned to the vege.tahle
kingdom the second rank in the scale of ob-.
jects composing the tmateriatl tuniverse. Trhe
line of separation between an animal of the
lowest, and a plant of the highest order, is so
stmall,. as scarcely to ba appreciable. Botht the
atminial and yegetab~le have a puncttiple of vitali
ty .sustained apid supported by organie ma
chinery, so complex, and by chemical changes,
anidcomnbinations.so intricate and itncomnprehen
sible, as to eide the itntensest researches of the
profoundest philosophy; and the most that can
be aeconmphsbedbiy the tsatowist amnd physiolo
gist is, to separate and analyze the several
parts compJositngthte animal and vegetablestrue
ture,and'thts to develope the secret springs and
whteels of this wonderful machinery, wvithout
-being able to comprehend or explain the prin.
cliewhticht gives it motion.
-Int discussing thme subject before qas this es-e.
ning, thme origini of the planit. or to speak more
technic-lly, the process of gernunation, is the
firstthing to wvhich I beg leave to direct yonr
attenition. Whatever difference of opinion may
have existed-in the infancy of the science of
vegetable physiology, it is now utniversally ad
mitted that all plants spring from seeds, though
they tmay be ptrop)agated by other means mult as
grafting anid budditng. For the purps of ex
atmiing the organic structure of seeds, and il
lustrating the process by wich they are chaung
-ed from the embryo into the livitng platat, we

spctng the bean. it will lhe fond to cotnsist of
tyvo lobes, which are called cotyledons: near the

lobes or cotyledons, is anothler siall body which
is the germ of the future stem or trunk of the
phaut, and is called the plumnula. All seeds
havethe radicile and plumula, whether thqy
be mono cotyledonous, asindian corn,wheatand
other smnall grains and the whole family ofgrassi
es; or whether they be di-cotyledonous, as fhe
bean and the whole family of legunenous veg
etab!es; and the process of gernination is coin
mon to the whole vegetable kingdom. A seed
is said to germinate, when it . undergoes . that
change by which the radiele is converted into
a root and grows downward into the earth, and
the plumnala is-converted into the stem, and
shoots upward, carrying along with it, in the
case of the bean, the two cotyledonas, 'which
-are employed in giving nom-ihenet to the in'
fitit plant, until, fron the extension of its roots,
and the-expansion.of its leaves, it is capable of
receivi-nglood from the soil and the atmosphere.
Itia fet well established, that tle changes we
have been describing never take place unless
mouisture be present; that they never take place
unless the teuperature be above zero, and that
some seeds will gcrminate in lower tempera
tnres than others; and thattlhcy never take place
unless atnospheric air or oxygen gas tie present.
Boyle, Boerhaave and Musclenbrock proved by
repeated experimens, that seeds will not vege
tate in the vactatum of an air pump; and Scheel
and Achard ascertained by siuilar experiments
that germination will not take place in nitrogen
gas, hyda ogen gas, or carbouic acid g as,.unless.
they aro ina state of combination with oxygen.
Light is also said to ha ve a sensible infltence
on the germinaton of seeds, tho' to what precise
extent, seems not to be well ascertained: it is
certain, however, that it retards the process, ei
ther by some inhereaat property which it po
sesses, or by indirect agency, in producitng a.
certain nodification of lat and .moisture uln
favorable to vearet.taion.
Thus it allours . that heat, moistu;-e and oxy.
gen -gas, are iadispeable to the process (if.
gerination; asit -will hereaftir he sen that
tlev are important agents in the further pro
gress of vegetation:
After the process of germination is comple ted.
the plant, under favorable circumtstances, con
tinues to grow; its roots are increased in nim
ber and size; its branache. multiply and expand,
.and it is obvious to the senses, thilt-the whole
plant.fiom i-s rapid increase ina bulk, is con
stantly acqtiring new accessions of matter: and
as this new matter cannot be produced bvy the
plant itself, it fIllows that plaats like aninials,
require food tint only for their iimediate nour
ishmaent, bitt also for the purpose of replacing
those particles of matter which, having become
nnfittcd for nutriment, rre throwna out .by the
excretorv vessels.
It was for a long time a qunestionamong phys-'
iologists, whether waler did not constitute the
only food necessary to tlesistenance & growth
of plants. Ttis itica, whidl subhsecinent erperi-,
nacts have proved to b erroneons, wasdoubi
less staggested by the fact, that the elements or
component parts of water, iamuely, oxygen and
hydrogen, are unifornly found inl the substance
of plants; but the experiments of Bergman and
3largraff, have forever exploded a theory, which
it wotld seem, nexer could have been seriously
advocated, excopt dn the infancy of the sci
ence. These philosophors -proved-that water
is a necessary ageirt in elaborating the food
of plants, and is the-vehicle in which it is con
ducted to the roots to 'be absorbed; and those
cxperiments which misled Van Henont, Bon.

the supposition that water is the sole and prop.

isertaianed lay the experimzents of Chemaiical

:oostittuenat elemeno~ts of atmnosphecric atir, name

atquire how the food is r'eceived; in what forrm
is received; and what chiemicah chanages it
undergoes, before it is ini a proper statte to hae
assimtilatedt to the substance of the planit. -
Int thte f'urthaer examinmtion of our suabject. it
will, I thinak, be impossible to wvithhuald our as
tent to the truith of the propositioo, that thecre is
i maost strikinig analogy between tamany of the or
ranic functions ofhanimals anad those of vegeta
ble.%. Thusa the roots of the plant perf'orma the
runtionts of die mnoth, and the leaaves perform
te fun ctions of the lunga s, in thte anaimial econio

tubes,constitute the vaiscua r alaparatuis by which
thecirculation of the filuids is carried ota, and

and decetnds, imipartiang new life and v'igotr.
Perhapt tno subhject connected with the science
of vegetable physiology has baen mtore thorough
ly inavcstigtated, thana te process by which the
plant receives and assitilates its f'oad ; anid al
tough many cu:-iouts and itnterestinag fiuets have
beeta ascertained by expe'rinments, yet much is -
eft ini doubt antd obscurity. It is true beyonid
questi, however, that die food whbich thae
.lattt ittbibies froajs the soil, is conducted hby
water, anad is received at the extremaeties of' thue
roots by a cellular tissuae i esemblitng the sponge,
called die spongiole of the rot. :The substance
intended for the future nourishmeta of the
plant is held in solution by water, and in that
state, enters Ie spongiole by a sort of affinity
-which, in che mical philosophy, is called capilla
ry attraction; but from the well known fact
that the actionof this principle is confined with
i very narrow limits, the ascent of die sap from
tihe extrenetics of the routs, through the trunk,
to the extrencties of the branches, and into the
leaves,.cannot be accounted for, but ipon some
other principle less hbvions, and more diflicult to
becomprelicuded. Aware ofthisdifficulty,physi
ologists attempted to account for the-phenone.
non. by ascribing it to the pressine of the at.
mespihere upon the spongioles; thus furcing tihe
sap through the vesrels of the plant, tpon the
same principle that a comumn of water-is made
to ascend in a tube by the pressure of the at
imosphere upon the external surface of tile
water. Thiis notion prevailed nntil it was ex
pladed by Dr. Hales;who ascerthined by an in.
genins experiment. thattle sap of the plant as
cends with a velocity suffivienmt toovercome the
pressure of a ciolumn of water 43eet'in per
pendicular heilit; which is nearly-one'third
greater than the force exerted' bytthe atmlios
phere. that being sniuicient to overcome the
pressure of a column of water of only 32 feelt
in perpendienlar height. The opiion now
generillv received is, that tihe cricnhntion of the
sap is efleeted- by tIhe alternate contraction and
dilatation of the sap vessels; hut how this con
traction and dilatation take place. so long as
veoables are 'denied tihe ftnetions of sensibility
and irritability -must' rn'prehe'd, ever remain
a pr6fomid mystery. *That the saniloes ascend,
however, and with the force ascribed to'it y
Dr:lades. hr, been proverli by ocutlardemonstra
tion 'funiled on experiment; and it is pretty
well ascertaine'd that it asceilds, in the infmcy
of the plant, thromugh the pith, an'd in its more
advanced-state, throngh the allmrnum or while
wood00. or in cnmion limrasealogy, the sap of
the tree, in contradistinction to the heart. The
sap, inl its ascent, underaoes little or no change,
instil it reacies the leaves of the plant. Here,
by means of the porosity of tihe leaves, it is ex
posed to the action of the atmosphere, and is
said to have a new property imparted to it by
tl.e oxygen of tihe atmnosphere; and thms, after
nnderaroing certain cheniici haMinges an'd comi
binationsin the Caves, piccisely a-thevenoms

with the air imi tihe hlngs becomes oxygenated
and purified, the sap is fitted fbr giving nour
i.<hmenmt to, and being assimilated with, the
proper-substance ofthe plaht. But the analogy
between these animal find vegaairble functions
does not stop here; for as the venous blood of
the ammnial, thus purified hy .being -brought ill
contact with air in -the lungp, is, by -ieans of
a di'erent set of vessels, conducted'back to the
hcart,-theine to be diimsed through the sys.
tem; so the :returning sap-or peculiar juice of
the plant, as it is now cal, dcscends not in
the satne vessels through which it ascended, but
returns throngh the liber or imner bark, deposit.

uscertained that thie pirocess which goes on dinr
mng thme day, is reversed at -night, oxygen beiing

It is obvious fri-i thie analogy which it bears
o a similar funmction in annuals, that this piro
:ess maty be called thec respirationi of vegetables.
Jarboniaceouss matter, whether it he derived

enierailly tnnfit for the l,nlrposes of flntrilion,

r'oportin as to forum cairbonsic acid gas in thie.

itmilated and incorpiorated into the vegeta~ble.
The last futnction of vegetables wvhich time
vill alh'e mue LBta otce abpireseint, is that of
throwing off their excrementitions or stuperfin
itus matter, by excretory vessels, and the pro
::ess is called excretioni. We see in this as in
all the wvonderfu phenuomena of vegetation, that
the vartons and intricate processes in the vege
able economy, are but so many links constitmut
ing the great chiaintof causes and consequiences,
indispensable to time accomplishmenmt of the u!.
lunate design of thme Creator of time Universe.
It is time opinmion of sonme physiologists that the
higher orders of plants possess manmy or all (if
of the funmctionis of animuals, except those of per
reptioni and voluintatry locomotion. However
piaisibile mig ht bet thme theory whmicht from anal

imng Buch a functioni: and so far as experimemts
have beeni imaide, they lend to the opposite con-.
chmisioni. It ha~s beeni ascertaine d by M. Macaire.,
that vegeitaides hatve nto power of discriminating
btetwveen foodi thaut is numtritionisatnd whlolcsome,
amid that which is poisonous or deleterions.
Plants, like time lords of thme creiation, also fre
pinently receive immore food thman is eithem neces
sary to their imediate wants, or is healthful to
the ,o::titstimn'. Thiliumetion of excretion
is intended to eiedy these evils; and whether
the food be in itself unwhblesome, or taken in
snch quantitiesas to gorge tile plant, it is car
ried back to the rootiand by them disgorged in
to the adjacent soil.
, In the very cursory and necessarily imperfi-ct
view I have taken of some of the processes
which nature employsin the vegetation of plants;
the receition and elaboration of proper food for
theit nourishment; the assimilation of so much
of -thautnourishment as may be needful to their
growth and fulldevelopeient; and theexcretion
of so much of it as may be either noxious or sit
perfnous;~f have pnrposely omitted the classifi
cation of plants as a branch of science belonging
more. particularly to the'depaetment of botany.
I have also omitted to notice the va'rious liquid
and solid substances composing the plant,whose
cheiical combinations and properties can only
be discovered in the laberatory, as more appro
priately belongi-g to the departments ofChen
istry and pharmacology. I ain constrained for
want oF time, to pass by withont particularly
noticing those nutritive substances found in the
prodncts ofvegetables which afloid to mankind
so large and so, palatable a poriion-sf theirdAaily

In conclusion dt'the subijet, I am conscious
that I maay fairly be charged with having tres
passed upon the time and patience ofthis very
respectable~and intelligenltaudience4nnless some
of the principles attempted to bo illistrated may
be nsefully applied in the prosecution of some
of the various purmuits connected with the cul
tivationofthec earth. Afew factswill be briefly
recapitulated.
If.as we have seei, a sed will never-vege.

elates but imperfectly when exposed tothe light,
th~e planter's first lesson is one, the solution of
which depends u pon a knowledge of these facts.

which he said was vital to the bill, and the
hour being late, the Senate adjourned.
ie will speak to-day. It is certain that
several other southern administration Sen
ators have determined upon that course.
They are unwilling to give New York, the
great financial and commercial advain
agoes which will result to her from the
prostration of the southern banks. The
New Yorkers; without part y distinctions,
are in favor of including the banks, believ
ing that they catn stand the shock.

Moved that the hill reported from the con
minee on military all'airs, for 'raising an
additional.force of si.tteen hundred men
for the pro tection-of Florida be .taken up,
and he subittited stunlry.cotniunications
from the Secretary of War, showing that
the Indians were in greater'orce, and more
mischievous than ever. Mr. Atherton
urged the necessity of disposing df the stilb
treasury bill, 4before any otrer business
wasinken up. Air. Coles inflirmed the
louse that there would be opposition to
to the hill referred to, by Mr..Thompson,
and that it would not pass wit hout much
debate. Tie mtolion was lost, as it requfr.
ed two thirds.
As the-rules were, it would retuire a
vote ,f'two-thtirds, onl 'Moudays, Fridays
and Sturdays, to tike isp the Stb-Treasu

and the maijority of the loose, favorahle
to the passage of the Suh-Treasury bill.
were determined to push it through, if
posibeii,-hefore any tlier husiiiess was at
tended to. The Whigs, on the other'hand
were eqttallv resolute in prevnting it.
It the evening se.;siont, at 4 o'clock, the
states were calel fOr resIluitions, and Mr.
Smith of Me., who first got the floor, offler
-ed Mr. Athertoi's resolution to change'the
the role. It so happens that, this being
rcsolion day. the motion-cotdd 'be made
without the asseitoftwo-thirds. If it was
not adopted it would go over for aTurtnight.
Mr. Smith accomtpanieil his motion by a
demand br the prevists question. Tre
mendous excitemetii.follsowed. The Whigs
denounced ihe proccedure as unfair, un
pnrliametirry, ilestructive of the rights of
tile minority, &c. 3efore the siting was
over, so high was the excitement that all
orI er al decorum were lost, and the an
thority of the Speaker was ttlery disre
garded. The lie passed back and forth,
between members, on several octsions,
and every-thing like deceney of behafv'our
was outraged. The House wvas very neat

been. if blows had been struck, which, at

Mr. -Cn'ihoun spoke about an hour, yes
ierday, on the subject of fle Bankrupt hill.
He did not profess-ro go flilly into the stib.
jeet, which, he said, embraced a great va
riety of topics, anid he intimated that he
migtt have anither oppormtiiity'to treat til:c
qiuestion moran *tlarge. But lie very di
tinctly defined his position in regard to the
matter. lIe opposed the hill. as reported
from the committee, as unconstitutional,
because it was nothing but anl insolvent
law. lie pointed out the -difference be
tween .ru inmolveit and a lankruit law
the former being intended to rilie-ve deb
tors, and the latter to regulate trailo. fle
wouuld nut vote for a mtere insolvetit lew,.
such as thte voluntar-y bill proposed.
- itt opposed as lie was to die bill, lie
was still nmore hostile to lie substitute of
Mr. W~all, that embraced whatt was called
the voltunta ry systemi and wvas liable, 00
that atccoitmr, to the samte objectioni which
he urged against the liill. It also, embra
celd what wvasleonminatedl the compulsory
systetm, which itt his opintiotn, wats the on
I)y conistitutional featutre in the sceme.
Butt this co-npttlsory pruocess, which for
med a bankrutpt law, 'in -the meaning of
the conastitutio, was too opp~ressire and
tyrannicial for adop'tion in m his country.
It had once beent tried 4y the law of 1800,
whlich was.limsited to live years, but aban
doned after an experimenit ofr two years.,
Under this provisiont, atny trader, owing a
debt of 50)0 dglhtrs wvould bie-litle to have
his business arrested. his property pit
in commission, atd sacrifteed, ife would.
bse crushed, at once, whereas, if allowed
time, hie would lbe able tos work tbrough,
successfully andi honorabty. The flututa
tions of the currency to nt hich we are ox
posed, from our banukitngsystem, rendered
such a latw pectuliatrly utsuitable to this
country. By a suddlen conitraction of the
currericy, a person wvith ample means is
unable to meet his debts. Hie might, af
ier a while, paty all, and have a large
surplus, but this law ruiins and destroys
him at once. There .wvouild be much m~ore
propiriety in gramnintg a stay lawv for his
relief, than in thus interposing to hasten
atnd comptilete Ihis ruin, He did not believe
that at single &ieterer wottid voste for Isis
compllulsor'y law, stamiling hy itself; but
matny, from anxiety to relieve debstors, osr
a dispsoshtiot to litinish the baniks, would
voste for it, in connection with the volunta
ry tad corporattionl provisions.
As to the lest feature of the stibstitute
apuplyinig the compuilsory processio banks
Mr Calhoitt argued that it would be more
ruious to the couintry than a devastating
tornado, or a decree of Providence sud--'
denly smititng the earth with sterility.
TIhe bltow wotuld noit fall on~ the corpiora
tions alonec, it wvould reach bevond thoem,
the whole tmass of the cominmunity. A
batnk not meetinig a debii to the amont of
$.500t, wot lie pitt in coammission, with
all its profits, credits, &c. The amiouti
of motney due to all the baniks was 450
millionis." The specie in theO contry a
miounted to 80 tutllionts. hlow wns the
immtenise debt to thu hatnks to lbe paid!
to'ini hsank piesper, for this law discredits
andt destrovs ths;,. andI not ini spsecie, for it
is trot in the country. E'very bsody would
bse runed by it, except the bankrtupt Coom
mnissioiners, w ho wonl fat ten on the sys
tems-all the indtustry of the counitry, espe
cially of the South atnd Wecst, wotuld be
wholly paralized by it.
Perhnns the banks, in New York and
other Eastern States, -ntfid'he *lile to
stand ethe shock. The place where the
rdvanue was co!lectcd would have great
advantages. In this view thellopieatiolis
of the law would lie unequal 'in different
parts of the country. it would not he a
itiifilrm law. lie did not sp'eak of mio
tives, but the elket of the law upon the
commerce and banking of the South,
would be most disasirious. As a means
nf concentratitig the mouied power of the
COUtry, it would- be more effective than
a National Bank. It would also unite the
bankinig system -with the Government,
and give the latter complete controle over
the former. -
In fine, Mr. Calonniaid. lie would vote
to strike out the clause embracing Iho
banks. and afterwards against the whole
scheme.
The question was taken and the baiks
were stricken out by a decisive vote, yea*
28, nays. 16, Mr. Clay of Keneucky
moved to follow up this, by striking out
the 18th section, as including the conipil
Fory systen. That question will next be
discussed. Mr. Calhoun has blown up
two parts of the bill, the compulsory 'and
corporation provissions, But his argu
meat againt the voluntary system is bt
conclusive. However, Igloubt whether,
a mjority of the Senate will go for the
volntary 111 alone,
lu the House, Mr. Leet, of Pa. spoke
in support of the Sub-Treasury Bill, and
Mr. Brockwoy, of Connecticut against it.

The -Rivers.--When our paper went to

morning and wanted but 10 inches of he
