PATEUT COTTON OIN.
HIS Gin can be made double, or single, ll
: - made double, they reduce labor, and gin jus:
double, the quantity of cotton over the single cylinder
Gin, no other knd having been in use pievme
io this pate lit; and whether single or double, llic\
are found to improve the quality ot the cotton, h^
more perfectly cleaning it. They ran be made l>
contain from 20 lo KM)saws in a stand, and whether
small or large, one hand will be suflicient to attend
llieui. The Gins have mechanical feeders und
li- ppers attached to them, which tree the cotton
rom leaves, trash, dirt, &c. before it can leach the
saws, and by the thorough hackling operation it
receives from the feeder*, winch make two revolutions
to one of tiie saws, it is almost in a halt
gined state, before it descends to the saw By a
very simple arrangement of a screw to each set of
sates, on which the hoppers rest, n d through
which the teeth of the feeders pass, they can b?
made to teed slow or fast to suit the condition oi
the cotton at the time. When made double, the
saws are placed on two sets of cylinders and turn
upon each other in opposite directions, and are
cleansed by two sets of brushes that have fourrevo
lutions to one of twe saw. The two cylinders can
be detached so as to enable the plnnler to run one
or both at pleasure, although embraced with feed? rs
Ac. in one stand. The whole is put in operation
with a drum and band, as in the ordinary Gin, and
may be propelled by horse, steam, or water power
It may also be propelled by iron running gear.
The force required to work it, is about the same as
that necessary to move an equal number of saws in
the common Gin. This Gin has been put in
operation in New Orleans lor two or three weeks,
and its success tested in the presence of a large
number of planters, merchants nud others, and 1
received their general approbation 1
Several gentlemen have been so kind as to-givc
the Patentee their written opinion lespccting the 1
merits of the Gin. A number of ofhers could be

ry ' J ?
what I think of your improved Cotton Gin, I liavr
to say, that I saw it work on Saturday the2f>th inst.
and wns very much pleased with its perlormanre
The mere fact of its self-feeding, seems to me to '
be a very valuable improvement; and besides, the
quality of the cotton, as it comes out of the process.
appeared to me to be better and cleaner than
from the common Gins in use, and that it saves
considerably in labor. Respectful I y, &p.

witnessing it in operation. The utilitv of
the double cy linders and saving of labor, will be
readily perceived and properly appreciated by the
