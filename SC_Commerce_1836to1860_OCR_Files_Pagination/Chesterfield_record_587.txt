.1 the Cultivator for Novemlier.
. i. allen's visit to England.
>f
srs. Gay lord & Tucker : Being
rt ni my way home to Buffalo, and
it knfi the anxiety of my friends to 1
j I the success of m v agricultural expe- <
> to England, I avail myself of a few i
f ents of leisure to state the general re.
>u In swine I went into a thorough
minute examination from the differ
>s species of the (Jhinu, the wild boar or
^a, and from the forests of Germany,
^cimens of which I found in the Zoolo.
u:al Gardens and on the estates of the
^blemen and gentlemen in different
jrtsof the country. I also examined all
le original breeds of England still left
f any consideration, and the various
ossess and improvement that have been
lade on them hy importations from
broad. I also saw specimens of the
lalmn, Spanish, French, German, and
Luftian breeds; then Scotch, Irish, and
Vesh, with crosses too numerous to
lertion. And the result of the whole is
hat the Berkshires, as, brought to thin
ouitry by Mr. Hawes, and such as il
lavi heretofore and now imported, for
;eneral purges of the fartner are,
ipoi the whole, the very bestv aniaas
in the world. There are some
irds of swine that beat them as tosiae; |
ni others, perhaps, in iittie minor points, j
Ittft what I wish to be understood as aai ;
jrting is, that the Berkshire unites more
ood qualities in him for general purpo s
than anything within inv knowledge;
nd in coming to this conclusion, I stake
my reputation as a breeder, and my judgment
as a man; and although I may be
called an interested party, t may be. permitted
to also add "without prejudice*
and after a long, laborious, strict, and, I
sincerely trust, an impartial infestigation
Bgrkshires in England are spreading
very rapidly, and are also now taken to
Sco'land, Ireland, and other parts of the
world. The name, consequently, as with
us, has become very popular; and all
sorts of impositions are there practiced as
well as here, with grades and every imaginable
breed. But the real true animal
in shape, color, and quality, is precisely
such as Mr. Hawes first imported here,
saving one exception ; and that is, a pig
will nowandthanWeast after the model
and color of the original breed; as figured
in Lowe's Illustrations, viz., sandy or huff
with waves or 8|>ort8 of black, and also
black with some spots or waves of white;
but the fancy of the people inclining to
those more black, or a dark, rich, plumb
color, just flecked with a little white, the
lighter colored and buff* ones have been
constantly thrown out, till they breed
with now and then a stray pig, as I have
so often before explained in the pages of
the Cultivator. For my part, I rather
fancy a slight buff with the black, and I
found tho largest hogs in the county so
marked after the old original. Wind
sor Castle has a buff spot on one, fore leg,
besides a slight flecking of the same on
other parts of him ; and T noticed that
more or less of his stock was thus marked.
The old breed has become nearly ex.
tinct, a few specimens only remaining;
and these so degenerated in size that
they are not now so large even as the
present improved race ; not comparing
at all with Windsor Castle. All assured
me that he was the largest animal that
had been bred in the county for twenty
years; and in the last No. of the Cultivator
you have rather under than oversta.
ted his dimensions. I know from what I
saw of the weights of inferior sized Berk*
shires fatting in England, that he may be
made to easily attain 600 pounds. Added
to this great size, he is fine in his points,
a most excellent conformation, and what
is rather remarkable, of soft thin hair
and skin. I took unwearied pains with
nil my other selections; and though I
could find none else qnite as large as
Windsor Castle-, they perhaps had a trifle
more of fineness of point and fashion.
In regard to the size of hogs, breeders
and pork packers in England tuke the
?ame ground as I informed the public
in Inst July's Cultivator, that they had in
Cincinnati, the greatest pork market in
America, and upon precisely the same
principles; and it would be a waste of
time forme to add another word on the
subject. Large animals have cense*
qucntly become very scarce in Berkshire,
and excecdiugly difficult to find. I per*
tfonally perambulated all Berkshire nnd
the neighboring counties, and also employed
agents who are dealers in pigs,
each one of whom annually buys th?usands,
and knows every man's breeding
in the country, to assist me; and I sent
over by the London packet ships Media,
tor and Wellington, and am to receive
next season stock from all the different
families bred thero that are worth pos.
messing. These I shall keep apart in
breeding at home ; and thus. I trust,
save the necessity of further importa.
tions for twenty years to come. Stock
of all kinds is very high in England now.
Pork and mutton sell readily in market
at 6d to 7 1 -2d sterling; equal to 18
and 14 cents per pound of our money.
White, light spotted, black blue, gray,
and all sorts of colored pigs may occasionally
be seen in Berkshire county ; but
the people there would scout the idea of
their being called by their name ; they
would consider it an imposition, nnd I
might almost add, an insult. And, to
my numerous questions, what do you call
them? They would give me some specific
name, or say, "we don't know,
they're not our sort." 1 do hope now
for henceforth and for ever to hear no
more about white and other Berkshires
than as here described for perhaps the
hundredth time as the true and genuine
breed, as improved by the Siamese cross.
I have full notes of all these things; the
discussion of which alone would occupy
a long art^clo, which I must defer to
some more convergent period.
Failing to find Ucrkshires as large as 1
anticipated when leaving home, I imrne*
didiately set to work with my agents for
some other breed f and after a volume of
inquiries, and traversing half the king*
dom, I found the Kenilworths, the very
largest breed of swine at present existing
in Great Britain. The owner of the sire
of one of the pair of pigs I purchased,
asserted that he would weigh, full fatted,
n ?
1,700 lbs.; but I think his maximum
would not overgo 1,3001b*. He stood
four feet high, was proportionally long,
with no bristles, but than hair, and really
possessed a fineness of points that abso
lately surprised me in 90 large nn aril ma
Indeed in gensral shape and conforms
tion he nearly approaches the Berkshire
His color was pure white. The size o!
the other pigs was not quite so large, and
a trifle coarser, while the sows were still
less} hut this 1 was informed was a I way*
the case with tiie br eed. 1 do hope thai
my friends no*' will be satisfied; for they
base it last in these, a large hog, and,
above all, a white one. But if these are
not large enough, I shall quite despair,
and recommend the importation of a rhinoceros
that I raw flourishing alongside
of an elephant hardly superior to him in
size, at the Zoological Gardens of Re.
gent's Park in Ijondon. He was upward*
of four feet across the buttock, and might
wtdgn'some three or four tons.
1 shall not have any of the Kennil.
worth breed of pigs for sale short of a
w ,1 l
year, 1 propose crossing me maies upon
the large white Yorkshire, and also with
a few of my Berkshire*. I think the
produce of either will be of great size and
excellent quality; and ns the number of
sows to be stinted in December to farrow
to n Kennilwoith hoar in the spring will
be in accordance with the orders of my
friends for this cross, they will please to
let me know their wishes on this head
ns quick as possible; for they may be as
sured, that ever with this produce, they
may safely compete for gain of flesh, in
a given space of time, with Woburns, or
any other bleed that gentlemen may hap.
pen to have on nand for the purpose of a
banter.
Nothing can be superior to the South
down sheep that I brought over for M r.
ftotch, of Otsego county, this Slate, and
our late minister at the Court of St.
James, Mr. Stevenson, and Bishop Meade
of Virginia. The sire of Mr. R.'s buck
won the first prize, 30 sovereigns, as the
best of hisage, at the Royal Agricultural
Show at Liverpool in Julv, and was let
to the Duke of Newcastle for this season
only, for 100 guineas. He was consid.
ered as near perfection as it is possible
for a sheep to be; ?md [ may add that
the son 1 chose, is nc disgrace to his sire.
Though only six months old, he weighed
when brought on boird ship at London
152 pounds. Mr. S:evenson'sand Bish.
op Meade's, about 18 months old. weigh,
ed respectively 254 and 248 pounds. And
the breeder of these superb animals, Mr.
Jonas Webb, of Bubraham, killed a weth.
r last Chri8tmus that weighed, dressed
with the head on, 200 pounds. The
* - ^ i e -9 A
bucks of this fleck usually snear irom in
to 11 1-2 pounds; sind I need not add
another word to the readers of the Cultivator
as to the superiority of South Down
mutton, and the hardiness and good constitution
of the anima ls making it.
Accompanying the sheep for Mr.
Rotch, was the most beautiful shepherd's
dog that I ever saw; and of a breed so
good, that it requires n6 instruction to
break thorn into the management and
care of flocks. I also brought over for
Mr. R. some of the large Dorking fowls,
that carry an extra toe to their heels.
To these I added a few pheasants, the
beautiful game bird of England, and a
cross from which on the common barn
fowl produced the celebrated game cock
breed.
Of Short Horn I brought nothing, for
fear of the disease so prevalent through,
out horned stock in England, and because
there is but one man's herd that can improve
our own; and his best I cannot have
till another year. It really pains me to
see any more Durham of ordinary quality
imported into our country. The expense
of shipping is enormous; and, after
all, they are now so plenty in America
that they can be bought for half or two
thirds the price abroad; and throwing
two or three stocks out there, New York,
Ohio, and Kentucky alone, might show
successfully against all England. This
is my deliberate judgment after a very
careful examination or tne nest anorr
Horn* in that country. Ayrshires we
can make here by the thousand, by crossing
Durham hulls on cur best native milkers.
The Scotch black cattle without
horns make the bent beef in England ;
and he is a capital hardy animal, and probably
pays the grazier a better profit
than any other; but he is black, which
don't happen to be a popular color, so
that there is no use in talking of him.
Herefords you have already pretty well
discussed. The Sussex and South Devons
are scarcely inferior to them in size,
and of a beautiful blood like symmetry
of form that excites universal admiration.
For horses, England ought to come to
us. She has nothing that can compare
with our famous trotters; and our Dutch
Pennsylvania wagon horses are far preferable,
in my estimation to her boasted

especially in the ptirnitive regions, it
much superior to tthatt of England, to produce
this noble animal in perfection; and
we have only to pay a little more attention
to this department of stock to soon
become large exporters.'
There are many other things, especially
in seeds, methods of cultivation, and
the condition of the people of England,
that I would gladly touch upon, hut [ find
my sheet already full and must forbear;
and to conclude, I hailed England with
delight, and left it with deep regret. It
is a charming couitry, hating itseverlast.

COLOUR OVIMOROVRD SHORT itORWS.
The Rev. Hhertry Berry says, "the co.
lours of Short.horns are red or white, or
a mixture of the two," The above quo.
, tat ion is made in the sixth No. of the
Agriculturist. In the same piece it is
said, there are no reds of the best blood.
This is directlv contradicted Mf. Berrv,
# # #
who says their colour is red, just as plainly
as white. The Herd Book proves that
some of the best pedigrees ever imported
into the United States were red, Ber.
tram (1816) was a deep red, and was the
highest priced hull that had been then im,
ported into the United States. Mr. Hustler
refused an offer of 400 guineas for
his mother, Red Daisy. He was the first
bull that erer sold for $1000. so far as mv
information extends. The Duke of York
when he was imported, ] believe was the
highest priced bull that had then been
imported into the U. S. He was red with
a littlle white. Mr. Rennick, the Ohio
Company's agent, selected him to use to
thfeir best imported cows.
I might mention a great number of reds
with superior pedigrees, but consider the
two given sufficient to show that red bulls
have as good pedigrees as any irhite or
roan. I know of no animal in Kentuc.
ky or Tennessee with better pedigrees
than the two named, and it will he very
difficult for the advocate of white or roan
to produce one as good.
SAML. D. MARTIN.
Col. Hampton, of Woodville, S. C.,
having purchased one of the hest Short,
horn Cows ever brought to this country,
requested his agent in Baltimore to secure
him a bull calf of the same breed, and en.
joined it upon him not to do it, until he
could get him one which should be of a
pure red colour?which, after some months
he got from the fine herd of Mr. Beitzhoo.
ver near Baltimore. Ws most admire
the roan, or the whitefiecFd(not spotted)
with red. The deep, dark, and clear mo.
rello cherry red of the fine coated Devon
is very beautiful.

DISEASES OP HORSES HILLING CORN.
The charaltanism practice in the medical
treatment of horses readily accounts
for the unfortunate termination of the
most of their diseases. At least such is
the conclusion deduced from my limited
experience.
The first horse I ever owned contracted
an inhumation of the liming membrane
of the eye, from exposure in severe winter
weather, and the action of the reflected
rays of the sun when the ground was
covered with snow. Every one who wit.
nessed the progress of the film which ren.
dered his vision hourly more obscure, in.
sisted on the immediate and free application
of burnt alum. The remedy was
tried, persisted in, and in a fortnight the
animal was stone blind. I reflected afterwards
how injudiciously I had acted in
yielding to current opinions when they
were opposed to the principles of nature.
Here was a horse, affected with an acut.i
disease of a sensitive tissue, due in a
great measure to a constitutional affection;
yet treated as though the part was destitute
of vitality, and without any reference
to the state of the general system.
Under different circumstances the application
of burnt alum would doubtless have
been very proper?that is, when the con.
AUi C nn rt rlomn n Hptl in. I
UlilUII Ul 1119 HIIWIVU ...
creased action. But the case was just
reversed.
I last winter had a horse affected in a
manner precisely similar, and received
identically the same advice from those
around me, I determined, however, to act
in accordance with mv professional judg.
ment. After proper depletion, therefore,
the local inflamation was combated by
cold applications (Solution of Sugar of
Load, &c.) and the use of necessary pre.
cautions to prevent irritation from excessive
light. The active inflamation sub.
dued, the film, which consists of a secret
tion of fluid within, and the thickening hf
the junctiva, or memhrahe covering the
eve, was easily removed by a solution of |
lunar caustic, lOgfs. to the ounce of wa-?
ter, applied by means of a camel's hair
pencil. The recovery within a fortnight
was complete.
I cannot understand why a rational
method of treating all diseases should not
be adopted. It esjrecially becomes the
duty of the farmer-physician to investigate
their diseases, rather than consign
them to the "horse doctor" with disgust.
The error of proscribing tor a name in en.
tire ignorance of the proximate cause, of
the malady might soon be avoided. I
seldom henr of the death of a horse
where the cause of it is professed to be
known, and still more uncommon is it to
hear of an examination being made after 1
death to clear up the raystety. But it is
i - 0
* ...
| (he physiologist and anatomist alone who
i can derife much benefit from opening
diseased animals after death.
I may* in this place record the result of
my experience the present year in hilling
corn. About 1-4 of my crop was plough.
edt in consequence of its being overrun
with grass. My neighbors insisted upon
the necessity of it to support the stalk, or
as one of my black men expressed it, to
1 expert the corn." Prom the diversity of
soil [ am unable to come to any concltf.
sion respecting the difference in vigor of
growth between that ploughed, and that
cultivated with flukes only; hut am satisfL
ed, the quantity was not increased by the
former process, which necessarily exacted
additional labor. As to hilling the corn
affording it any support, 1 am satisfied of
its inefficacy. The corn that was plough,
ed was more prostrated by winds thkn
the othcr-a result to he attributed, possi.
ble to its more exposed situation, for I do
not imagine either mode of culture ren?
ders it less obnoxious to the effects of
hign winds.

COMMERCE OF BRITISH INDIA.
COTTON CULTIVATION IN INDIA.
From the period of Captain Bay lev's
mission to America, for the purpose of
making himself acquainted with the ays.
tern adopted in that country, in the enl.
tivation of cotton, to the transportation
of that successful method to our Indian
possession. we have watched with deep
interest and from time to time recorded
the progress of the speculation. On Cap*
tain fiayles's arrival from hi* interesting
and ably accomplished tour of Investigation,
we devoted, our readers may perhaps
remember, considerable space in this a*
partment of the Atlas, to the explanation
of the system in question, and of the ad*
vantages contempleted by its adoption.
,
That system is, we are glad to learn by
the papers of the last overland mail, meet*
ing with the entire approbation of the In*
dian government and there is every pros,
pect of the anticipated benefits arising
thereby, being eventually realised. The
Madras United Service Cazette of the
25th June, states, that government has ordered
the transfer of the American cotton
planters, sent to organize their plans at
that presidency^ froin Tinnevelly toCoiin*
ha tore, which country is better suited to
the project* The local authorities, it appears.
with full confidence of ite ultima to
success, were exerting themselvea zeal*
ously in promotion of the scheme. Captain
Hughes and Mr. Pitch, who are stated
to be the most efficient coedjutors in
the cause, were busily engaged in carrying
out the plaos of the government at the *
Madras presidency, whilst those on the
Bengal side, (with Captain Baylesaa unpen
ntendent.) are equally energetic In the
prosecution of their plana. Fren the
Bombay branch we have no recent tidings
on the subject.?The American cotton
seed and implements of husbandry "*
sent from England, had reached Errode, *.
and great preparations were making in
various parts of the country in bringing
this extensive enterprise into immediate
operation.
At the Agricultural meeting of CalcnU
ta, in May last, some of the soil of the island
of Cheduba was stated to have undergone
analyzation, and was fcwnd to
correspond exactly with that cm which
the Sea Island cotton of Georgia (8. C.)
is produced. A report on the subject of
this important discovery had beert made
to the Indian government, nnd a cask of
Sea-Island cotton seed had biwn, accord*
inglv, shipped to Cheduba.
It has long been a dogma, among cotton
