an atra sesaon or Congress: but in conse
quence of a disagreement between the two
Houses, neither thou, nur at an) subse
quent period, has there been any legisla
tion on the subject. The effort made at
the last session to obtain the authority of
Congress to punish the use of the public
money for private purposes as a crime, a
measure attended under otherGovernmenis
with signal advantage. was also unsuccess
ful, from diversities ofopinion in that body,
notwithstanding the anxiety doubiless felt
by it .o afford every practicable security.
Tfe result of this is still to leave the cus
tody of the public money wi:hout those
safeguards which have been for sever'd
years earnestly desired by the Executive:
and as die remedy is only to be found iu
the-action of the Legislature. it imposeson
me the duty of ag-ain submitting to you
the propriety of passing a law, providing
for the safe keep ina of the public moneys,
and especially to ask that its u.e for pri
vate purposes by any offit:ers entrusted
with it, may be declared to be a felony,
punishable with penalties proportioned to
the nagnitude of the offence,
These circumstances, added to known
defects in the existing laws, and unusual
derangements in the general operations of
trade, have, during the last three years,
much increased the difficulties attendant
on the collection, keeping, and disburse
ment of the revenue, and called forth cor
responding exertions from those having
themt in charge. Happily hese have
been successful beyond expectation. Vast
sums have been collected and disbtrsed by
the several Departments with unexpected
cheapness and ease: transfers have been
readily made to every piart of the Union,
however di-ant : and defulcations have
beeni far less than might have been antici
pated, -from ths absence of adequate legal
restraints. Since the efficers oft lie Treas
ury and Post Otlice Departments were
charged with the custody of most of the
public moneys reeeived by them, there
have been collected sixty-millions of dlol
lars, and, excluding the case of the late
collector at New York, the awgregate a
mount of losses sustained in tle collection
connot, it is believed exceed sixty thou
sand dollars. The defalcationof the lWte
collector at that city, of the extent and
circunistnces of which Congress has been
fully infortned, ran through all the modes
of keeping the public moucy that have
been hitherto in use, and was distinguislt
by an aggravated disregard of duty, that
broke through the restraints of every sys
tem, and cannot, therefore, be usefully re
ferred to as a test of the comparative saiv
ty of either. Additional inlortnation will i
also be furnished by the report of the See- f
retary of the Treury, in reply to a call
made upon that officer by the Iloute of t
Representatives at the last svsitton. requir- i

In the modes of' business antd official re
shaints on disbursitng offices, nIo leiah I
change was produ~cedl by the suspension or<
specie paymienits. The report last referred
to will be foutnd tto cota'in also much use- I
ful information in relation to this subject.
I have heretofore assienedl to Cotngress I
my reasonts for believinog that the establish
mtent of an Independent National Treastu
ry, as contemplated by the Constittutiotn,i
is necessary to thes safe acti'on ofl the Fed
eral Government. The suspension of spe
cie paymetnts in 1837. by the banks having
the custody of the public money, shtowetd I
in so alarming a degree our dependlence on i
those institutions for the performance of I
duties requiredl by law, that I then recomn- I
mend the eptire dissolution of that con
tnection. This recommendation has been
subjected, as I desired it should be. to se
vere scrutiny and( animated dliscutssion:
and I allow myself to believe that, tnt
withistandinig the natural diversities of
optinion which may be anticipated on all
subjects involving such important consid
erations, it has secured in its favotr as gen
eral a concurrence of pub'ic sentimient as
could be expected on one of such mnagni
tude. -
Recent events hiavo also continuedi to
develops newv objections to such a conl
nection. Seidom is any bank, under the
existing system and practice, able to meet
on demand. all its liabilities fir deposties
and notes in circulation. Je maintains I
specie pay ments, and transaets a profitable
business, only by the confidence of the
public in its solvency; anid whenever this
is destroyed, the detmantds of its depositors
atnd note holders-pressed more rapidly
than. it can make collections from its debt
ors-force it to stop paynment. This lossI
of confidence wvith its consequences occur-t
red itn 1837, and afforded the a pology of
the baniks for their suspension. Thue pub-i
lic then acquiesced in the validity of the
excuse; &,while thestate Legislatures didi
not exact fromn them :heir forfeited charters,
Congress, in accordance with the recomt
mendatin of the Exeetntive, allowedl them
time io pay over the public motney thevy
held. althoughi conspelled to issue Tre'astiryi
notes to stupply the denicietne' thuts created."
It now appears 'hat there arc otther mo
tives thtan a want of publhic 'ontfidlenie un
dci which the banks seek tojustf them-1
selves in a refusal to meet their obligations.
Scarcely were the country and govern
ment relieved, in-a degree, from the diffi
culties occasionsd by the general suspen
sion of 1837, when a partial one, oecurrig
within thirty months of the former, produ
red new and serious embarrassments,
though it had no palliation in such circun
stances as were alleged in jusificatiin oif
that which tiad ptreviously taken place.
There was nothing in the condition of the
6ountry to endanger a well managed bank
ing insltitutiion; commerce was deranged
by no foreign war; every branch of mana
facturin industry was crowned with rich
rewards: and tie more than usintl abuu
dance of our harvests. ;ller supplying our
donestic want, had left our granaries and
store honses filled with a surplus iir expur
tation. It is in the midst of this thiat an
irredeemable and depreciated paper cur
rency is entailed upon the people by a
large portion of the banks. They are ot
driven to it by the exhibition of a loss of
public confidence, or of a sudden pressure
from their depositors and noteholders, but
they excuse themselves by allegmng that
the enrrent of business, and exciantge with
foreign countries, which draws the pre
ious metals from their vaults, would re
quire, in order to meet it, a larger curiail
ment of their loans to a co .parativ.lv
sall portion ofthe connuniiytlan it wal
ltt coavenient for themn to bear, or perhaps
afe for the banks tiexact. The plea has
eassed to be one of necessity. Conveni
ence antid policy are now deented sutiicient
to warrant these Institutions in disregard
ing their solemn obligations. Such con
duct is not imerely an injur% to individual
creditors, but it i- a wrong to the whole
community, from whose liberality they
hold most valuable privileges-whose
rights they vitolate, who.se Lusi.aess they
rerange, and the value of whose ptruperty
they render unttable and insecure. It
must be evident that this new ground for
bank suspension, in reference to which
their action is not ony disconiected with,
but wholly independent of, that of the pub
lie, gives a character to their suspensions
tore alarming than anv which they ex
ibited before, and greatly jiereases the
inpropriety of relying on the banks in the
transatiots of the governmient.

merely on others in its own vicinity, but
oa all those who connect it with the cen'
ire of trade. Distant banks may fail,
without seriously affecting those in our
principal commercial cities; but the flaiLu1re
of the latter is felt ait the extremities of the
Union. The suspension at New York, it
1737, was every where, with very few ex
repttioans, fillowed, at son as it was
known: that recently a, Philadelphia itm
inelintely affected the hanks of the South
and West in a similar mauner. This de
pendence of onr whole banking system on
the institmions in a few large cities, is not
found in the laws of their organization, but
in iliose of trade and excbange. The
banks at that centre to whicb currency

for nerchandize, hold the power of con
trolling those in regions whence it comes,

But the chsin of this dependence doe,
not stop here. It does not terminate at
Philadelphia or New York. It reachies
across the ocean and ends in London, the
centre of the credit system. The same
laws of trade which give to the hanks in
our principal cities power over the whole

Frotm this influence they cannot now
