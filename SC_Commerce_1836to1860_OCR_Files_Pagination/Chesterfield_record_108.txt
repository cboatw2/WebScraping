The inventor ot this implement made
n trial of one of them at our place, a few

days since, in tne presence ot several gent
icmcn, farmers and machinists, the result o. ^
which was highly satisfactory to all present!'
They are constructed with from two to five *
shares. Tiie one used upon this occasion
had two steel shares, and was worked by j
one hcrsc, which power was sufficint to en-' fc
able it to do its work with great ease and i Jn
exactness. A.-the reader will suppose, it j Ic
carried two farrows, which were laid with j as
much nicety. From the peculiar mathcmatical
propi iety with which the proportions t0
of the plough are arranged, there? is no jost- a'
ing or inequality in the resistance, so that |u
whether regard be had to the horse or the 1,1
ploughman, the labor is lighter, much light- *b
r, than with the common plough. Air. 111
Cline managed it most of the time with his be
linger and thumb resting on the reins placed 'a<
on the cross-bar extending from handle to be
handle. The wood, work is got up pretty *b

prised to obtain the closeness with which hii
31 r. C. was enabled to approach tl'e corn ha
witliout injury. Indeed so exactly does it tic
do its work, that there is little left for the gr
hoers to perform; for, in fact, that us well stt
as turning up the ground is done by the itn- Oi
pigment itself. So satisfied arc we of its im. di?
incuse superiority, that we have engaged wi
one, with a view of working our corn. To ha
i s it appears, that his double shared im- fie
plcments are competent, with the propelling rc
force, to do as much more work in any hi]
given time as any other plough we have str
ever seen witliout increasing the labor to im
to cither man or beast. so!
.Mr. Clitic is a resident of Bucks county, oc
Pennsylvania, a practical farmer, and know- fr?
Jug the deficiencies of the old plough, set jm
himself sedulously to work to produce an sa
implement that should supply them, and we t|1(
think \vc hazard nothing in saying, that he faI
has been triumphantly successful. He has
a patent, and as we believe he deserves i', su
we sincerely hope he may reap a fruitful ou
harvest of profit us the reward of his ingen- va
uity and perseverance; for certainly he u.j
has rendered a most important service to a%
ii;s agricultural brethren, by reducing the fa,
expense of cultivation so far as the plough is ru
concerned, lidy per centum. As "money m|
saved, is money gained." so has Mr. Cline ?(
placed it ^ i.hiu the ."lower of every busbandman,
to economise h:s ploughing c.\- y
iicnditurcs to the amount named bv us.? ?

At times like the present, when Irom the |
pteeariousness of our seasons, crops are J .
uncertain, it becomes the farmer or planter
.. an
to avail mmseJt ot every opportunity to j
curtail his costs of labor, therefore, it ap- j1
pears to us, that a more eligible means of *{'
effectuating this object, has seldom been lJ
presented to the public than the present, in t!1'
the shape of laborsaving machinery.

EVIDENCES OF THE DEDUCE. the
***\Vc now come to the consideration of tai
that great tremendous catastrophe of nature "n
the Deluge. A story of this kind can be m;
demonstrated to be true or false. If the tin
whole earth was overwhelmed, traces of its po
submersion must remain ; if nor, there can an
be no such traces. And if all but one fam.'- Z:
ly were swept away, all the inhabitants of fin
the globe, being their decendants, would un. Tl
I doudtcdly hold some tradition to this effect ; sit
otherwise, not. Let us now sec how stands fiy
this case in these respects. ,
Bones of horses and deer have been ih<
discovered on the Himmalaya mountains, un
16,000 feet above the level of the sea. vj?
They were obtained^ by the Chinese Tartars, x
out of the masses of ice that fall with the vc
avalanches, front the regions of eternal a
snow. Between the strata ot various aj]
mountains, marine substances and vegetable pr
productions repose together in mingled iq,
confusion. In some places,tlsat LaBolcu, al
the marine productions of the tour quarters er
of the globe are huddled promiscuously to- to
gether, as by the rush of mighty waters.? b<
Almost all the table lands and gradual el
decilivties of mountains, are covered wtih ; ly
deposits of loam & gravel called diluvium, ! si
.u?'h sub?i line flood- deno-it, os they ! qi
radually retire to their wonted beds. In
lis diluvium, pebbles and loam are confusdly
intermingled, totally unlike regularly
irmed strata, and just as rushing waters
ould have blended them together. This
iluvium is to be seen over the face of the
hole earth, even on the lofty mountains ;
ad in it are intermingled the bones of varins
animals, thus proving incontestable,
Kit the deluge covered those mountains,
id overspread the globe. Enormous
insses of granite and other rocks are
rewed on hills and in valleys, throughit
the greater part of the northern hemisliere,
which have been drifted over mounins,
valleys and seas, requiring for their
>moval thus, a force and body of water
Iiicli nought but a general inundation
laid have furnished. Valleys wide and
;ep, called valleys of denudation, exist in
I parts of the world, which exhibit indu- l
table evidences of having been excava- j
d by irresistible diluvial torrents. The!
ist valley of the Rhone, for example, has .
en excavated between the Jungfrau and !
onte Rosa, and its disrupted excavations j
e strown over the plains of Burgundy. I
!ven the Baltic sea has ovidently been |
oped out in this manner. In numerous 1
stances, mountains arc torn asunder, i
aving chasms of friglitful dep:h. And j
the reverse of this, stupendous granitic 1
agments of mountains in many places j
wer in awful majesty thousands of feet j
oft, entirely insulated front other mounin
masses in the same regions, and even
their immediate vicinity; thus showing,
at the intermediate elevations which for-1
erlv must have connected them, have j
fen swept away. Mount Cervin, aniso- 1
- * ? r .
tod pyramids ot more tlian ieet in i
ight, situated on the most lofty ridge of,
c Alps, and likewise the Landscrone, a
ountain in the plains of Lusace, situated
iout two leaeuesfrom a chain of mounins
of its own kind, and rising like a sur
loaf nearly a thousand feet, are strik?
examples of this kind. In many places,
Us of a large size exhibit evidences of
vingbecn accumulated by the commo>n
of the waters, being composed of
avel, fragments of rock, vegetable submces,
and even the bones of animals !
n the other hand, vast valleys have been j
icovered, filled up with the rushing |
eckof diluvial rubbish, beneath which J
ve been discovered the beds 01 rivers,:
Ids and forests ! Traces ofniighty cur- i
nts may be seen on the surface of many
lis and valleys, in the masses of rock
owed along upon them ; and on rcmov5
the surface, rakings appear upon the
I'd rocks beneath, which must have been
casioned by the drifting of those rocky
igmcnts. In various parts of the woild,

of cubic*, yards, disintergrated from

r distant plains, whither they must liave !
en rolled hy the irresistible torrents of a ;
bsiding inundation. There are numer
O J
s caverns strewed with animal bones of j
rious kinds, imbedded in diluvium ;,
lither it is evident those animals fled to
oid the rising ilood, and there met their
le, being drowned hy the torrent of inshing
waters, and buried beneath the
isses of its accompanying diluvium,
tine of the mouths of these caverns are
en choked up by these diluvial masses,
irther evidences of the universality and
dden occurence of the deluge, may be
en in the fact, that even the arctic rc-gi)s
are strewed with the relics of animal
d vegetable productions which now exit)
the temperate and torrid zones alone
ere by demonstrating, that the climate of
c antediluvian worldin high polar latides,
must have been much more mild
an at present, and that a refrigerating

of the globe with water, and a dimin
ion of the surface of the land (which at J
at time evidently happened) might be ex-1

From a small beginning they have now
vastly increased in numb*, rs and prosperity,
having at present about four thousand
members, so that a banking institution was
declared necessary for the accomodation of
their domestic commerce. Previously to
this, however, they had received quite an
accession to its strength and popularity in
! the person of S. RigJon, once a preacher
| of tiie doctrines of Campbell, and a man of
| no ordinary talent and literary attainments,
! possessed of a shrewd and sagacious mind
and business capacities, united with indefatigable
perseverance and ardour in his unj
dertaking; qualities of which the renowned
; prophet. i?isleader,seomsalmosl entirely destitute.
He soon became the favorite of, and
j grand vizer to, Smith; and under their decision,
a banking house was established, forthe
I good faith of which all the ".Saints" were
j pledged and Smith and Rigdon |appointed
I president and cashier. Notes were issued
I /-. ft 4 In I ft wl 1 nil

fifty thousand dollars. Hard times came
1 on, much of it soon returned, and the bank
failed.
Residing temporarily hut a few miles from
t Kirtland and hearing of these things, 1 felt
not a littledesire to vsitt!ie"MormonToivn."
I accordingly determined to visit the plac ,
and set my feet in the precints of the *'?IoJv
Citv." A gentleman kindly offered me
* * O *
a seat in his carriage, and we drove to the
'promissed land." It was a beautiful Sunday
morning, and although we reached the
temple at an early hour, yet we found it filled
with worshippers, "aftei the order of' Joe
Smith. The region around is exceedingly
l l - li Ml.. .1 k u..
urOKCIl ailU UI1IY, Uiuugu uy IIU Hit-ails uu?
productive. They own the land lo the extent
of about two miles square, well furnished
with mills and other water privileges.?
Their houses are small, and all wooden,
the house of the prophet being quite small.
The temple is a splendid edifice, covering if
I mistake not, sixty-eight feet bv seventy-six,
three stores high, including the attic built of
rough stone, handsomely stuccoed, which
gives it a very rich appearance. The interior
forms two apartments for meetings,
similar in size and arrangement, each
apartment being large enough to accommodate
1200 persons. The interior is very
singularly, though handsomely "done of]'."
Tne joists are supported by six fluted cob
unis. Jti.icli oi ttiese apartmenis is capable
of being subdivided into four separate
divisions by canvass curtains let down by
windlasses from the ceiling.
Each apartment contains six pulpits,
arranged grandatim, three at each end, for
the"Aaronic piiest hood" and at the other
end for the "priesthood of Melchisedec."?
The ships are so constructed that the audience
can face either pulpit as may be required.
In the highest seat of the "Aaronic
priesthood" sits the reverend fathor of the
prophet; the next below is occupied by14 Joe,"
and his prime minister, lligdon. The attic
s:ory is occupied as school rooms, five
in number, where the branches of English,
Latin, Greek and Hebrew languages arc
taught to a large number of students The
actual cost of the temple is not known, but
it is estimated to have cost not less than
860,000. Smith and Rigdon were both
present, having just returned from a journey
of some weeks. Smith's intellectual appearance
is altogether medics res, his countenance
exhibiting a blank expression, (if
the term be admissible in reference to a
coutenance destitute of all expression,)
and the only tiling indicating a sense of
superiorly is his perfect composure and
case of manner before the gaze of the as.
sembled multitude, tor the audinance was
rather a multitude, than a congregation.?
But, on the contrary,Ridgon's countenance
beamed with intellect, his eye dark and
lustrous, his voice a fine tenor, his diction
vigorous, flowing, phrenologist, would have
been pronounced "good." He Iiarrangued
the assembly, and the aim of his address
was to reconcile his people to the endurance
of their prrsent embarrasmonts, in which
they are involved by the pressure of the
times, the failure of their bank, &c. His
harranguc was mild, artuful, insinuating,
and as far as I could juge, had the desired
effect. The whole appearance of things
indicated to my mind that Rigdon is the
man who puils the wire of the whole ma.
chine behind the screen of Joe Smith's inspection.
Many industrious, intelligent, and
wo?thy citizens are the followers of Joe
Smith, and it is but justice to say that they
have man hosted a liberality of sentiment
and a spirit of Christian charity which
should put their enemies to the blush, and
which many of their bitterest persecutors
would do well to imitate. Yet; in my estimation,
Sydunc Rigdon, can better translate
the tables of Mormon for the cars of
that people than can the prophet Joe himself.
But truly in this thing, Smith lias
signalized himself, and Mormonism becamo
a matter of history. And the sum of my
reflections on the subject, when returning
from the "Town of Mormon," was, that a
madman or a fool have ever set the world
agog.
June, 1637. A VISITER,
l romthc(Cumbcrland Presbyterian.
MORMON1SM. *
I have seen occasional notices of the
Mormons, and of Mormonism, in the newspapers;
but in none of them have I found
any thing like a systematic account of their
faith. Many of these people arc living
near me, and some of their publications
have fallen into my hands. From these I
have drawn up a short sketch of their
"views of the gospel." It forms an item
in the history of religious delusion, an account
of which, perhaps, may not be uninj
teresting to some of your readers.
The Mormons hold that the gospel "is
God's scheme of saving tnen,which scheme
consists in putting tnen in the possession
cted to occasion, lias actually laKcn
ace. So sudden was this catastrophe
d its consequent change of climate, that
decayed carcases ofelephants have been
mid infixed in the everlasting ices of Siria?and
numerous fossiled vegetables, {
their various stages of growth, remain I
attest, with their countless leaves, and j
anches, and stalks, the fearful visitation j
the destroying catastrophe !
THE MORMONS.
The circumstances related concerning
: discovery of the hook of Mormon, its
mslation byj he inspired "Joe Smith," and
? subsequent emigration to Missouri, are
miliar to a!!. But in consequence of the
lobooracy," of that region, the revelation
iking an assignment of that country for j
; location of tho "New Jerusalem." was j
s'poned lor "further consideration," and !
other designated as one of the "Stakes of j
" whirh should be extended so as i
ially to embrace i6tiie promissed land."? j
lis'place, appointed by the revelation, is j
uated in Gauga County, Ohio, about '
c miles from the shore of Lake Erie, and i
cntv two miles from Cleaveland. This J
?y call Kirtland. Here they congregated |
der the authority and immediate super.;
sion of their great high priest Joe, Smith, j
hey were soon informed through the re.
aling agency of the "prophet Joe," that
temple" -was necessary, as a prelude to
I further improvements; and they were
tewise informed that it should bcconstrucu
of brick. But, mirable dictu, when they
tempted to burn the brick, the earth they
nployed for the purpose was found to be
tally unfit?a circumstance that had not:
-en looked into when the decree and rev- j
ation were made; which were consequent, j
revoked, and an order for stone materials !
jbstituted therefore, they having "any '
jantity of that article on kind.*'
of the power of Go J. For die gospel is J
'the pcwer of God unto salvation." Hence i
the Saviour when he commissioned the
npostlcs, declared that these signs should '
follow them that believe. Iu my raine i
shall they cast out devils, tec., XVI. 17, i
18, that the power of God shall rest upon I
them." It: further confirmation of this, >
they refer to Peter's sermon on the day of 5
peutecost, "when afor telling the people t
they must repent and be baptised, that 1
Apostle declared that they should receive t
j the Holy Ghost, by whom they were to pro- t
pliesv, dream dreams, .and see visions, &c. <
that is, they were to be made partakers of t
the power of Go I unto salvation. When i
the apostles went for h t orn Jerusalem, to i
proclaim tiie gospel, they who received it I
j spoke with tongues and prophesied, thus [
| manifesting that they bad received the t
: power of God." In addition to the above I
I the Mormons frequently refer to 1st Corin- I
thians, XII. 26, to prove their Gospel. <
Such, say the Mormons, was the gospel
i proclaimed by those commissioned by the i
1 m 1 .? ) JI *7
. saviour himself; anu mis, ana ims onty, is i
. the "order of things set forth in the New- s
j Testament." 1
The Mormons declare that the "church i
; lost the power of God," on an early day, s
j at least as early as the 5th century ; and f
i from that period there has been no true t
church on earth, until by the revelation of r
the Lord Jesus Christ, the power of God a
was c.Vimunicatcd to them, "by the min- ^
i istry of Holy Messengers." (Angels 1 C
suppose!) An J they assure as that they
now possess among them, those marks ot I
the power of God, enjoyed by the apostles s
and primitive chrisiians. "The power of f
God was communicated by the laying on 1
i of the hands of the apostles, prophets, t
| evangelists, Src., and this is the reason why
j it is called the power of God/' Tiiis au- {
j thority was also delegated to them, wlien 1'
j thev received the "power of GoJ."
Hence the Mormons contend that theirs s
is the only church of Christ on earth, be. 1
' cause they only possess the only infaliblc f
I mark of the true church,?the I July Ghost [
| in his extraordinary operations. (Accor- r
j ding to their system the spirit exerts no r
j other agency in man's salvation.) All oth- a
j er professing christians have run before a
they were sent, are acting without acthori- v
! ty, are going in the ways of Cain, "and run- 1
ning greedily after the ways of Baalam for 1
reward, and if they repent not, must perish v
in the gainsaying of Babylon!'' 1
With respect to repentance, faith and
| Baptism, the Mormons are Campbellkcs.
i "Except a man he born of water and of t
t the spiri', he cannot enter into the King. [
' Hnm nf Ond."?not of the snii it first and
then of water. " From the confession of ^
! Nicodemus, it is evident that he believed, c
I which is the first step in the way ofsalva- v
; tion, and Jesus in the text informs him t
! that water baptism is the second and the
Holy Spirit the third."
| The Mormons think it is evident, from |
, our Lord's Commission, Mark XVI. 10,
that baptism is as essential to salvation as 1
: faith, and that the neglect of cither is J
I equally fatal. Repentence with them is
I merely a reformation of life. They reject j
| infant baptism, 4,for children are whole j
i and need no repentence, and it would be
j indignity to the atonement of Christ to
I baptize them."
] This is a hasty sketch of those people.

From tho Cumberland Presbyterian.
WILLIAMS THE OCCULIST, alias c
IMI'uSTER.
Having published various puffs of the 1
person whose name is at the head of this *
! article, in the way of advertisement; and 1
havinc iiood reason to believe that he is not !
iJ o # I
what he ought to be; as will be manifest
! from the following documents, wo deem s
i it an indespcnsibleduty to the public to ex*
pose the low, dishonest, and ungentlemanly '
! thods by which this man enables himself to
dupe; the suffering. 1
Mr. Williams called at our office shortly
after his arrival, and expressed a wish to s
I have an advertisement in the Cumberland
i Presbyterian, which we conduct, and also
in the Union, which is published at this *
! office. Our terms were stated and c m- '
p'ied with; in consequence of which the j
: pulls of Mr. \Y illiams appeared in our pa*
j per, without our paying any particular *
j attention to them. A few days ago, WillI
iams left in our officea large parcel for our f
! examination, said to contain diplomas, re- 1
j commendations, &c. On last evening, I
j before he knew whether we had read his
j diplomas or not, yea, before he knew
whether we could read them, many of them k
being printed in the French language, this
impertinent charlatan placed in the hands 1
of the foreman of our office, the following 3
j mess of bombast and falsehood for our *
i signature, to be published as our composi- c
i tion, as our recommendation of his lying A
j impostures?and accompanied with the
! precious promise of thirty dollars as a c
reward of dishonesty. Verily, this strolling \
' impostor has a vas; amount of impudence,
i when he can attempt to bribe even a Minj
ister of the Gospel and Editor of a religious :
I journal. But his production, which he (
! would have us palm upon the public as (
| ours, will speak for itself. It reads as 1
I follows: 5
j "As there has been so great and violent *
i Medical opposition to Doct. John Williams, ithe
English Oculist, from the first day of
his arrival in Boston, as is proved by inter. j
esled individuals belonging to this < ountry,
wc thought it to be our duty thoroughly to (
| examine his title or claims to public confidence,
and are decidedly of opinion that he i j
has such claim in a superior degree, for the j ]
following resons. 1st. We find that hisj,
reputation was est Wished as an Ocuhst
long before the year 1309, while lie liveJ
in London. 2dly. That in 1815 tli^
Medical societies of Paris,and many others,
sent him their diplomas as a Corresponding
Member of those Societies, which dipluTias
we have seen, as well as the letters
Tom several physicians of great celebrity.
Idly. That all the sovereigns of France,
>inc? Nepoleon, and the present king of
he Belgians, have chosen him to be ttieir
lonorary Oeculist. We have seen their
Jiplomas, and a letter from his excellency
he French Ambassador, at Washington,
certifying they are genuine, as well as all
lie Medical diplomas. 4thly. We have
eud a great variety of letters and d >cu*
nents from distinguished persons we either
enow personally or from character and re*
uttation, with tfie greatest pleasure and inores',
which confirms the good opinion we
lad previously entertained of Mr. Williams'
)ractice. And,ojiiy. we nave seen an
>f Mr. Williams' poor patients in this city;
I'hcyall (but one of them,) say . their sight
s improved, though variously afflicted; one
)f whom says that he had actually lost the
light of one eye seventy years! Had he
tot been a professor of religion amongst
is, and a Methodist for forty years, we
ihould have doubted his testimony of such
ixtraordinary success!! We should think
t would be depriving the afflicted commu.
lity of blessings if we kep' them in ignorinco
of the above facts. It appears that
llr. Williams leaves this city for Louisville,
zincinatti, &c. fyc. to-morrow morning.
In the interest of suffering humanity, we
lave consecrated a part of our journal with
ome of the many accounts of cures per*
ormed by the remedies of the above rnen

To secure our services in this dishonest
ransaction, Williams also sent us the loljwing
receipt for our signature:
Received of Dr. Williams the Oculist, the
uni of thirty dollars, as a compensation for
he insertion of* the article containing the
ive reasons why we speak in favor of his
tract ice; once at least in the C. Presbyteian,
the Union, and the weekly Monitor
icwspapers, tri-weekly and weekly, which
ire printed in this office during this
ind the following week, as well as the
vliule of the articles which have been prined
in either of the above papers, and pronise
to forward to Mr. Wiliiams at Louisille,
G numbers of each journal containing
he article alluded to.
Nashville, June 29,1837.
What can be thought of this fellow but
hat he is an impudent impostor, and has
iccome so hardened in crime that he imigines
even those who make the fairest
;rctensions to morality, honor and religion,
:an be bought up by bis paltry dollars,
vhich he has no doubt swindled out of the
listrcsscd.
In the above article which we were to
mblish, as our owti we are represented as
laving discovered "that his reputation was
established as an ? culist long before the
rear 1809." We have marie ve such dis:oi'cnj.
That certain French Societies
;ent him certificates of membership is ev.
dent tiom a tew papers wc reau last mgni;
jut when Williams penned the article he
lid not know whether we had icad these
:irtiricates or not; and such certificates
night be procured in the same way this
nan designed to make us father his filthy
trnfT, viz: by bribery. We did see a domment
purporting fo constitute Williams
Oculist to the king of tlie French?hut in
>ur humble opinion this is no evidence
hat Williams is no: an imposter. We
mppen to know that it is an easy matter
o he made the Oculist, or the breechesnakcr
of a king. Every person who has
>assed through the cities, towns and vilages
