TriE LOVE OF HEADING IN CHILDREN. j
[Froui " The School-Master and Advo- I
cate of Education," published monthly tit i
Philadelphia. Price S3 per annum.] i
We would recommend to all parents i
who have at heart the best interests of their
children, to infuse iuto them, in the earliest
years, a love of reading. The advantages
of such a habit arc great, and it exercises
an influence over the destinies of the future \
man, which few, without reflection, would
suppose. The effects, even in childhood,
arc beneficial, and evident to tbe most careless
observer. The reading child is superior j
in temper, docility, and knowledge, to his :
book-hating companions; he indulges less
in idleness and play; lie is not so fond of
mischief; and he does not contract so |
many bad habits. He lakes, at school, a j
stand higher than his fellows ; and, when i
grown to manhood, outstrips theni in most
of the rivalries of life.

Every father, especially every father liv- ,

hooks, taking care to add to it from day to
daj', according to his means, such new pro_
ductions as are really of value. A few dollars
thus laid out?and, dear as books are
supposed to be, a very small sum will pro- ;
cur^an excellent little family library?will
bring him a l>etter iuterest, if he can look
lor it iu the advancement of his offspring,
than if invested in the most gainful of stocks.
Upon our farmers, therefore, in particular
should be enjoined the duty of providing
little libraries for the use of their families.
From the nature of their occupation, and
their situation at a distance from towns, the j
education of their children must be defective
; and to them books will prove more ,
valuable, as they are actually more neccs- (
sary, than to the children, of any other ,
class.

AX AWFUL LESSON TO DRINKERS.
The Favorite Son.?At the hist March
term of the Court of Common Fleas, I)ela
... XT? x- 1. 1
ware uuuuij, 1 un\, a iimii a- (
bout 24 years of age, by the name of Jonathan
Thompson, was indicted tor maiming .
and disfiguring the person of his father. It ]
apj>cars from the evidence on the trail, that,
on some day in January, the son was seen j
by two females near the cabin ofhis father, ,
the rest of the family being absent. Soon
afterwards, the same females, who were the \
nearest neighbors, heard repeated cries of (
distress, but were afraid to approach the ca- J
bin. In a few minutes they saw the old {
man lying upon his back, on the ground
near the cabin, stretching up his arms as if
begging for assistance. They went to him j
and found him almost lifeless, with a piece !
bitten out of his upper lip, nearly the size of j j
one's thumb, his eyebrows and cars chewcd
through and through, and one arm from
the hand to the shoulder covered with ,
ruuuus iiiJ(I5~T5yTTic teeth. He was re.
moved into the cabin, and placed on the bed. '
His life was despaired of. The next morning
the son was arrested, and His clothes J
were literally soaked and stiffened with
blood?the blood of his father! It further ap. !
poarcd that the father and son were both in J
the l>abit of drinking spirits, and that the
son was under the influence of liquor when '
lie committed the outrage upon his father,
lie was his father's favorite son, and it ap. ;
pcarcd that they would occasionally have a j
drunken frolic together. There had been !
some previous misunderstanding in regard ' i
to a farm, and the son, who was peaceable 1
and inoffensive when sober, but quarrelsome <
when drnnk, had thrown out some threats
against his father. When arrested in the
morning, he was sober, and the officer took '
him to see his father. He almost fainted 1
at tiio stgnt, and called lor a tumbler ot \va- ?
tor, and a chair to sustain himself. His fa- i
tlier refused to appear in court to testify a- 1
gainst him. lie was his favorite son. The <
jury returned a verdict of guilty, and the i
wretched man was sentenced to the Peni- I
tcntiary for tlaree years, the victim of bad I
example and bad precepts. "Train up a
child in the way he should and when he
is old he will not depart from it." 1

PARENTAL EXAMPLE. ?
A gentleman in one of the lower counties
of this State many years ago deter- ,
mined never to use ardent spirit himself
or to bring it into his house. His chil- 1
dren were then young, but now his sons, j
twelve in number, have grown to bo men,
temperance men, and most of tfrem pious. '
When they are gathered around him and '
he looks upon their manly forms, vigo- 1
rous, healthy, sober, pious, his whole soul '
must overflow with gratitude; When he *
dies, he will leave a precious legacy to .
his country?a valuable example, twelve 1

rely in any hour of trial whicn may come
I upon her. And doubtless, they will inji- '
I fate the example of their parents, and
r' .teach their children the lesson of abstiI
nence they themselves have learned.
9 In the upper end of Henrico county, is
I another example of the same* character.
I Years ago, ardent spirit was banished from
I the family? and though one may stand at J
I that house, and count eight other houses
I io the immediate vicinity, whose former
I owners have been slain by strong drink, \
I yet all the children of this family, have
I escaped its effects, and arc monuments '
I of the efficacy of parental example.

this bread is rery hard?why don'f we j
have cake and nice things, as we used to .
H when we lived in the great house ??oh, |
tbat was such a pretty house Mam- 1
H ma?and I do love to Jive there so; you
made sweet music there, Mamma, with
H your fingers, when Pa would sing ; Pa j
H used to laugh thent and take me on his ,
knee ; and said I tens his oun dear boy. <
What makes Pa sick, Ma ? I wish he (
was'nt sick for it makes me afraid when
he stamps on the floor, and says so loud, f
.jleoTgc go of to bed Bay, when will he s
*et well ; and take mc on his knee, and j
ovc me as he used to ? But, Ma, there!
s a tear in your eye ; let me wipe it;
there another conies ; oh another! did I i
make you cry these tears, Mamma 1
Ilush little innocent, you cannot stop
pur Mother's tears, for they are the very
overflowings of a fountain, filled with J
blighted hopes, anguish and misery. She
cannot tell you 'when your Father will
love you,' for alas he is a drunkard.
I heard a beautiful hoy scarcely four
years old, lisping this to his mother and j
I pitied him from my inmost soul. Ilis
name was George Elwyn. His father |
was once rich and happy, and nearly idolized
his Iitrlc son ; but in an evil hour, he j
began to sip the intoxicating cup ; the habit
had grown upon him, until the peace of
his family was destroyed ; and he a ty- j
rant. The beautiful house, in which they j
had lived, was now exchanged for a misjrable
cottage in the suburb of the city
ind little George doomed to be the com-1
panton of the indolent and vicious.

ro\YKR OF Till- TRESS.
It was considered by Edmund Burke, 40 j
years ago, that there were in Britian 80,000 i
readers. "The Penny Magazine," pub-1
iicKcl m T.nmlnn hv the "Society for the j
Diffusion of Useful Knowledge," has now
alone UOO.OOO purchasers, and probably
1,000,000 readers. It is printed on a largo
sheet in duplicate, 10,000 being printed in
1 day, which in the common mode of printing
a few years since would have occupied
a jingle press nearly three weeks. It is sold
it a penny throughout the United Kingdom.
In the great printing establishment of
Mr. Clawcs, where the above work is prim
led, there are employed 30 type founders,
5 stereotype founders, 7 inch damping paper,
and ICO compositors. The principal
composing room where the type is set is
270 feet long, and is filled from end to end
villi a double row of frames. Two steam
engines are employed in driving the printing
nachincs, of which there are eight that can
jach throw off from 700 to 1000 imprcs
nous per hour. mere are 10 common
)r In ting presses for fine work, and 5 hyd aulic
presses of 260 horse power each, for
)rcssing paper. Tlicre are in the establishnent
about 1,000 works in stereotype, of
vhich 75 are Bibles. The first cost of these
ilatcs would amount to 400,000/; the
veight is about 3000 tons, and if melted and.
sold for old metal would be worth 70,000/.
flic average quantity of paper printed anounts
weekly to the astonishing quantity '
>f about 2000 reams. j
THE MOON HOAX.
Kvcry one remembers the famous moon
loax that was played upon the wise citizens
jfNew York, and through them on those of
lie Union by a facetious and clever writer
)vthe name of Richard Adams Locke. It
lppcars that a copy has been presented to
Sir John Ilerschel, whose discoveries in the
noon the said paper purported to detai], by
L'apt. Caldwell of the American ship Lo.
rant, and the following is the letter of Sir
fohn Ilerschel,acknowledging the receipt of
he same.

Rowand's Tonic Mixture.
A Lasting Cure for the Fever fy Ague.
THIS worthy remedy earnestly rcj?el8 the slur
of being a quack medicine, it being the result
of many year's study, experience and labor
in the medical practice and observation of Fever
and Ague.
It is composed olsucli medicinal principles as
were considered most fit to restore tbe harmony
of action between the stomach and Liver. By
renewing the healthy action of the digestive organs,
it lias proved itself of remarkable benefit in
Dyspepsia, Depraved Appetite, Heart-burn, Wa.
ter Brash, Flatulency, Jaundice, Night Sweats,
Dysentery Bowel Complaints, but it is in the
treatment of FEVER and AGUE or Intermittens
Fever, that its powers have been principally
tested, and with those who have seen its usefulness,
it is pronounced sovereign.
Among a large list of certificates of its efficacy
in Philadelphia, where the manufacturer resides,
there are a number from Physicians of that city.
Hundreds of others in different parts of this country
bear testimony to its unrivalled success. At
least a hundred might be given from persons in
this place and the adjoining neighborhood who
have been cured by it, but it is thought to be altogether
unnecessary. It may be proper to mention
however, for the encouragement of those at
a distance,who are afflicted with Fever and Ague,
to use this remedy, that several of the Physicians
of this town, have during the past year, and do at.
this time recommend ita use.
To meet the wants of this section of country,
for which the subscriber is the sole agent, a full
supply will be kept constantly on hand.
Price $1 per, Bottle with full directions for its
use.

JOHN WRIGHT?Agent.
X. B. For such persons as are afflicted with
habitual and obstinate costizcness ??Ir. Rowand
has prepared a vegetable Anti-costive Pill without
mercury, a dose of which pills he recommends
to be taken just before commencing the
use of the Tonic Mixture, and to use them afterwards
as often as necessary to keep tho system
regular until thoroughly restored.
A supply of these pills arc on hand and Jor
sale as above.
