her tret one important subject 011 which
we disagreed, rmJ tlmt was the President's
protest. Passing to the next, I find the
f same concurrence of opinion on most of
the important subjects of the session. We
agreed on the question of Executive patronage,
on the propriety of amending the
Constitution, for a temporary distribution
of the surplus revenue, on the subject of
regulating the depositee, and in support of
the bill for restricting the power of the
Executive in making removals from office.
We also agreed in the propriety of
establishing branch mints in the South
and West?a subject not a little contested :
at the time.
Even at the presont session wc have not j
been so unfortunate as to disagree entire- '
f- ly. We have, it is true, on the question
of receiving abolition petitions, which I regret,
as I must consider their reception, !
on the principle on which they were rew**r-w.<l
cui-r*rulf>r nf fhf? w'tiolo ??roll lid

to the abolitionists, as far as this Governinent
is concerned. It is also true ihut
wo disagreed in part in reference to the
present subject-. T4ic Senator has divisled,
in relation to it, between myself ami
General Jackson. Jfc has given his
speech in support of his message, end an- !
nounced his intention of giving his vote in J
lavor of my bill. I certainly have no right j
to complain of this ^division. I had ratheT I
have his vote than his speech. The one J
A\iLI stand forever on the records of the j
Senate (unless expunged) in fa for of the j
:hill, and ^jie important principles on which j
it rests, while the other is destined, at no ;
distant day to oblivion.
I now pot to the Senator from Georgia, |
Jt wo short questions. In the numerous and 1
'important instances in which we have j
agreed, I must have been either ri^ht or i
^rong. If right, how could he be so uncharitable
as to attribute my course to the !
!luw and unworthy motive of inveterate ,
'hostility to Gen. Jackson ? But if wrong,
in what condition docs his charge against J
. . I
inc place himself, who has concurred with j
.me in all these measures ? [" ere Mr. j
King disclaimed the imputation of improper
motives to Mr. C.] I am glad to hear
'the gentleman's disclaimer, said Mr. C.
hut 1 certainly understood him as asserting
that such was my hostility to General
Jackson, that his support of a measure
was sufficient to insure my opposition; and j
this he undertook to illustrate bv an anec- i
?dote, borrowed from O'Connell and the j
Npig, which I must tell the Senator was
snuch belter suited to the Irish mob to j
which it was originally addressed, than to
Xhe dignity of the Senate, where he has repeated
it.
But to,.return from this long disgrcssion
:I saw. as I have remarked; that there was
reason .to qpprchcod jliat >the principle,
embraced'htttte Message might be reduced
to practice?principles wliiuh I believed to
be dangerous to the South, and subversive
.of the liberty of the press. The report fully
. states what those principles are, but it may
.not be useless to refer to them briefly on the |
present occasion.
TIio .ussnmrxl for Concrress the )
-right of determining what publications are j
incendiary, and calculated to excite the 1
slaves to insurrection, and to prohibit the
transmission of such publications through
.-the mail: and, of course, it also assumes
rtlie right of deciding what are not incendiary
and of enforcing the transmission of such
through the mail. But the Senator from
Georgia denies this interference^ aad treats
at as a monstrous absurdity. ! had (said
Mr. C.) considered it so intuitive, that I hud
not supposed it necessary in the report to
udd any thing in illustration of its truth ;
but us it has been contested by the Senator
J will add in illustration a single remark.
The Senator will not deny that the right
of determining what papers are -incendiary
and of preventing their circulation, implies |
that Congress has jurisdiction over the sub- i
ject; that is, of discriminating as to what
papers ought or ought not to bo transmitted
by the mail. Nor will he deny that Congress
lias a right, when acting within its
acknowledged jurisdiction, to enforce the
execution of its acts; and yet the admission
of these unquestionable truths admits
the consequence asserted by the report and
.so sneered at by the Senator. Hut, lest lie
should controvert so plain a deduction, to
cut the matter short, 1 shall propound a !
plain question to him. Ho believes that t
Congress lias the right to say what palters
-ire incendiary, and to prohibit their circula- <
iion. Now, I ask him if he does not also
believe it 1ms the right to enforce the
circulation of such as k may determine not ,
to be incendiary, even agamst a law of
(Georgia that might prohibit their circula. .
lion ? If the Senator should answer in tiie 1
alSrmative I then would prove bv his admission
the truth of the inference for which I
eontenn, and winch he has |xronounccu to [
be so absurd; but if be should answer in 1
the negative, and deny that Congress can
enforce the circulation against the law of the
State, I must tell him he would place himself
in the neighborhood of nullification.
But the principle of the Message goes
stiH farther. It assumes for Congress
jurisdiction over the liberty of the press.
The framers of the Constitution (or rather
those jealous patriots who refused to consent
to its adoption without amendments to
guard against the abuse of power) have by
the first amended article, provided that Con",
gross shall pass no law abridging the liberty
of the press, with the view of placing the
press beyond the control of congressional
legislation. But this cautious foresight
would prove in vain, if we should concede
^ to Congress the power which the President
^ssumet of discriminating in reference to the
chnractefcjlvbat publications shall or shall
not be transmitted by' the mail. It would
place in the hands of the General Government
an instrument more potent to control
the freedom of the press than the sedition
law itself, as is fully established in the
report.
Thus regardingthe Message, the question
which presented itself on its first per- \
usal was hew to prevent powers ro dan- *
jcrous and unconstitutional from being
carried into practice ? To permit the por- f
;ion of the Message relating k> the subject; R
under consideration to take its regular I j,
course and he referred to the Connnittee on j t
the Post Office and Post Roads, would 1 i a
saw "be the most certain way to defeat what j ^
1 had in view, I could not doubt, from i *
the composition of the committed that the ' r
report w ould coincide with the Message, ! v
and that it would be drawn up with all that i v
tact, ingenuity, and address for which the | ^
chairman of the committee and the head of! ?
the Post Office Department arc i*>t a little ;
distinguished. With tliis impression, IU
could not but apprehend that the authority i1
of the President, backed by such a report,; j
would go far to rivCt in the public mind ! j
the dangerous principles which it was by j J
design to defeat, and which could only be j 1
effected bv referring the portion oi me
Message in question to a select committee i
by winch the subject might be thoroughly j
investigated, and the result presented in a |
report. With this view I moved the com-! j
mittee, and the bill and report, which the ?
Senator lias attacked so violently, are the j
result. . | (
These are the reasons which governed .
me in the course I took, and not the base J <
and unworthy motive ofhostility to General |
Jackson. 1 appeal with confidence to my ,
Sifeto prove, that neither hostility nor at-;,
tuichmentto'any man or any party can
influence me in the discharge or my public
duties; but were I capable of being influenced
by such motives, I must tell the (
Senator from Georgia that I have too l'rtttc
regard for the opinion of General Jackson,
and, were it not for his high station I would
ad, his character too, 10 permit his course '
to influence me in the slighest degree, cither
for or against any measure.

The following account efthc massacrcofCol. :
.Fannin and hk men by the Mexicans is taken ,

Texas for publication. The account after sta- :
ttog that articles of capitulation had been sign- i
ed proceeds:
The officers were then called upon to deliver j
their side arms, wliich were boxed up, with their
names placed by a ticket upon each; adabul up.
on the box stating they should soon have the ho- 1
nor of returning them, and it was their principle J
to meet us now as friends, not as escniics.
1 f
Col. Fannin and the jnen were that afternoon i
marched back to La IJahia, the wounded with the <
captain of each company, and our surgeons were (
left on the field to dress the wounded, wliich
was completed on the 21st, when we were all
rouveved back to the fort, where we found the
men in a most miserable state. They were bru- !
tally treated?they were allowed hut very little :
water to drink, in consequence of its having to i
bo brought from the river, and but a small piece i
of meat, without salt, bread, or vegetables. On :
the 23J, Major Miller and HO men were brought
into the fort prisoners ; thev had just landed at
Copano from the United States.
Oil the 25th the Georgia battalion was also 1
brought in; it had boon surprised and captured
between ^Victoria. Dcmill's Point, marched
back and confined with us. Here wo were now
nearly 500 strong, guarded by 1,000 Mexicans,
without being allowed the slightest liberty :a any
respect. * 1
The Mexicans had always said that Santa . <
Anna would be ut Lailahia on the 27th, to re- ! <
lease us. Accordingly, on that day, we were or. ,
dered to form all the prisoners; wc were told),
that wo were going to bring wood and water, j '
atrtl that Santa Anna would bo there that day; J
\vc were ordered to inarch all the officers at the
head of the file, except Colonel Fannin, who lay
wounded in the hospital. As wo inarched out
of the sally port, we saw hollow squares formed
ready to receive us ; we were ordered to file left
and marched into a hollow square of double file 1
cavalry, on foot, arminl with carbines, (com- '
monly called scopcts.) and broadswords. j
This square was filled and closed, aud the i
head of the remaining tiles wheeled oft' into the j
other squares, and so on, until all \ypre strong!}' ;
guarded in squares. The company of which the
writer of this was one, was ordered movo to for- I
wardjA, no more was seen of our unfortunate comrades;
we marched out on the Bexar road, near
the burying ground, and as we were ordered (
hilt, we hoard our companions shrieking in the
most agonizing tones, " Oh, God! Oh, God! |
Sparc us!" aud nearly simultaneously a rqpnrt !
of musketry. It was then we knew what was to '
l*o our fate. The writer of this then qbscrvcd to J
Major Wallace, who was his filc-lo uler, that it I
would be liest to make a desperate rush; lie said j
no, we were too strongly guarded; lie then i
appealed to several others, but none would fol- j
low; lie then sprung and struck tho soldier on j
his right a severe blow with his fist, they being j
at open files; the soldier at the outer file at- ;
tempted to shoot him, but, being too close, was!
unable; tho soldier then turned his gun and
struck the writer a severe Wow upon tho left

I while the Opposition in the Senate evety
day parade before the Public the seven
J i millions in the stock of the Bank of the
II United States as a part of the surplus in
\: the Treasury, they so contrive it that not
5 i a dollar of it can reach the Treasury.
' Judge White, Mr. Calhoun, Mr. Clay and
* Mr. Webster are ever and anon pointing
' to the seven millions of bank stock as a
j fund for distribution, while Mr. Webster,
I ns chairman of the Committee on Finance
holds back for months, from the action of
~ the Senate, the bills passed by the House
of Representatives to provide against the
' notorious conversion by RiddTe of themeans
of ike old l>ank to the purposes of
* the new."
Now sir, (-said Mr. W.) the journals j
j show that neither I nor the committee
have held back any living from the action
ofthc Senate. All hills i? any way re-'
' spotting the late Bank of the United
^ States, which have been referred to the
committee, have been reported to the Senate
long ago, and are now on the list of
2 orders, to be taken up in their turn. If
2 this libeller had not been willing yjven to
traduce and injure friends, rather than to
lose an opportunity of injuring opponents,
he would have remembered that a majority
of the members of the committee on
Finance are supporters and friends of the
Administration. I am happy to bear my
^ humble testimony to the diligence and
3 promptitude with which the3e gentlemen
c discharge their duties, and every body j
knows that it is in their power at any time j
r, to report any measures they may choose;
3 to report, or to call up any business which j
f they may desire to call up.
* The bill to which the foregoing parac
J graph refers was referred to the commitj
tee April 14, and was reported by the
] committee, w ithout any amendment, April '
0 j 21, as appears l>y the Secretary's minutes, ]
*! endorsed on the bill: 44 Act repealing the
_ 14lh section ofthc act to incorporate the
fj Bank of the United States. April 14.

on Finance. April 21. Reported

s I will add, sir, that this ?s not the first
? time that I have been obliged to take no"
ticc of statements in this paper respecting
f my conduct as chairman of -flic comniitf
tee, which were in direct coirtr&diotiort of
