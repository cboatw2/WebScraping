Wear.?The market for this articlo remains
withont change The sates are very
tight at |fl.W a 6.87$. Large quantities
are efFuicd at 19)50, although holders aro
not anxious to sell. Thu unfavorable news
from thejOhio River has a tendency to keep
the market firm, its low stage prevents too
stock of Flour from accumulating to any
amount it may reasonably bo anticipated,
from a knowledge! of former tinvs# that the
Ohio will close betweeo the 10:h and 20 h
of the sucoeoding month. Bven if there
should bo a .rise previous so that time, not
mora than oneJialf the product of that porv

Massaciiusstts.?The etate election toe
place in th e state last week ; lull retun
have not yet reached us, but from thooe r
ceived, it appears that if Mobtom, the admit

elected over Governor Everett, he has com
very near it. FVoca all wosms kiifti howevi
the sleotion seemed to turn upon other quei
tions -than national politics. Gov. Evsrei
was open y committed in favor of theHWdt
gallon law** or *1he law which pnnhihfcn th
sale of anient spirits in less quantities than I
gallons. All topers and a large proportion <
temperate drinkers too, of coarse, opposed hi
election; and this question produced ntor
excitement in many if net most parts of th
state than any other. Gov. Everett wu ala
obnoxious to the abolitionist* who are numerou
in the etate ; and the moat of them are aaid t
have voted for Morton. These men, howevei
being once associated with the Administrate
party in a warm contest may possibly contir
uo to act with thom in future elections. Abb<
Lawrence is elected to Congress from th
Boston district in the place of Mr. Fletch<
resigned, and Mr. Baker, to supply a vaeanc
in anothor district, caused by the death of M

as weru also their predecessors.
