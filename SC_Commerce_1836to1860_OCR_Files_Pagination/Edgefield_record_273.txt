"Emigrais are still comine in. even at
this late season. I mnet a number (if lamrif
lies coming in, when I was at Nacogdo
chtes. It is astonishing to see the nutimber
of travellers passing throughs the country.
I have seen some lately from Illinois, Ala
hsama,. Tetnesee and Mii-isbippi. who
say there will be an exteosive emnicratzon
from those States, particularly from Mis
sissippi aid Alabana-gretter than hat
ever before been known. From all ac
counts, there are more persons failing in
Mississippi, at this time, than there ever
were before, and a number of them bring
ing their negroes to Texas; some, 50 or 6U
negroesor more. I have heard it asserted
that improved land has been sold there as
low a-s 5U cents per acre,which,three or four
years ago.sold at from 15 to 20 dollars. Ote
man came in lately, who had nearly-100
negroes. Ile left his cottou after working
it once over. I understand some ofthe
County officers have ressned rather than
make the people sacrifice their property.
I 1ihink I have seen nearly 20 men in the
1i st mon Ith who failed, and came into
Texas. It would not astotnih me if a
populat'on of 10,000 or 15,000 persons
were to leave that Stile, and come to
Texais. If so. it will only delay the pay.
ment of their debts. as I aim sure they will
be colle-ted very soon after suit is com
mettced; oppeals will probably be taken.

MEssUs, EDIons.-At daiy light this
morning, I w as awakened by a heavy dis.
charge of artillery from the lof:v heights,
of tiamburg, known to Many person as
the citadel, overIopping the beautiful.Park
belonging to Henry Shultz, the euterpri
sing and enlightened founder of Hamburg.
%% ith feelings aroused by so stidden and
unhooked for a cannonading, I soon round
out the can-e. &Ir. Shultz was rejoicing 6
ver the 18thatnniversary of his &,urish
ing anti 'respecled town. As th:e .loud
peals would boom over this place, reared
ihrough toil and pain, and ousing from
slumber the many happy and industrious
Ditizens, I could almost fancy the envied
ree :ngs of this more than common man,
a hose works of usefuliness are know% n to.
us although, in person, he may be a stran

Eighateen ycars, this day, have passed
tince the foundation of Ianburg was laid
aid ab a full grown clild,.these years have
recutred a populous and extraordinary
[own. Her star of glory has rken, and
s now clear of those dark clouds that
seeied to many as threatening'oLscurity,
md to shat out her brighinfesifimi ihe -
6vorld. But her brillia'ney will shinie, and
:heer generations yet unborn, for nature
ias marked with her finger the site of
Hanbrug, as a place to .be noted among
the cities of our Republc-aind who. then,
:an overthrow the wvorksnowi erected?
Feeble ian may Iali to'his teak and
inversed fellow creature, and Is) schemes
Ir a paper annihilation-but all -their
3lans will be useleqs as their own tniek
less. She speaks for herself. Her-im
Iorts ani exports are sufficient proof of
heir stability. - -
Having 'bnderstood from a citizen-of
Hamburg, that the Founder intemled to
lun-inate, at evening, this great natural
military place, J was anxiout for the time
to arrive. I will endeavor to give you
tome idea (f this vahiable propert%. The
leights are something' less ho oe-half
mile front Savannah river, which separates
Hamthirg from Aigu-ta, and are about one
hundred fet above the level of these cites,
ionmaandng a view of some ten or fifteen
iiles on the Georgia side, being of the same
latitude n., the U., S. Arsenal'situated on
tn eminence omatze Ihree or four miles Irom
Angu.ta. The Heirhts, taken in a direct
hlie, will measure one quarter of a mile,
-ut following 'he righiu neles which mark
i out. the distance would be over a half
isile, from each extremity, giving a beau
iful view of Hamburg and 'Augusta. The
ipacious and well planned walk on ili
Heights is shaded ly the-ride of -Oina,
tlanted some twenty feet apart.* Below
is the !omantic and lovely gruve of natural
woodland. designated by the founder of
Hamburg as a Park,' well laid out % ith.
nalks, and 6itted up' with'ecomnodation
eats. giving to every ind-idual seeking
pleasure and recreatiotI, all the comfort
int could be expecied froto the steady
taind of naore. He that could not enjoy
uimsell at this place ' ould be unlial.p., any
wvhere.
The hour at length arrived, at which I
talculatedi to see, n ith my ow"n eyes, the
tcene already pictured int fancy. But howv
wveak w as my imaugination, and hons far
aelow the reality were my canticipations.
Dun every other ofthe trees atthe top of ibe
H-eighis, was-placed a brilliaint lamp, with
ihe exception) ol that part which directly
apposes the bridge over the' Savannahb
river, where each ol the trees had a lamp
ittached, making about one hundred and
Ily. That part of tihe ptark, imamediately
.urrounding the spring, was likewise bril
liatly illumtinated with a quantity of lights.
rtere also were a anmber ofamoving lights
an the ratmparts, somte rt'presenting tho
seven stars, whilst others formed an imuita
ton ofaseparaie stars. The fine band of
Hamburg en'livened the scene, by playing
variety of' popul .r airs-the w hole pare
renting one of the tumst splendid arnd de
lighiful exhibitionis Ie.ver wit eessaed.
The enchanting scenery n'as sufficiently
beoautifunl to iniduce the gods and goddlesses.
to ahandon their syivatn retreats, andi select
hbisespot for thieirtevenitg revels. Indeed,
ns ho could believe himaself among mourials
in this fairy grove, lit upt-so. tasteftully and
so beautifully decorated hj the ready hand
of the fiauindr of Hanmurgt and whonou old
not, that witnessed ibis scene, desire that
his could alwvays be, .and who among the
throng there gathsered, was not p~rouid of
bieing a citizen olfHamburg?.
