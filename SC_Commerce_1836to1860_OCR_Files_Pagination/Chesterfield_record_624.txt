By the steamer Britlanin, which errived
in Boston on th'% 23fd January,
^a??* London accounts have been received,
down to January 3d and Liverpool ac.

* financial and commercial affairs is more
favorable than was expected. Tno Presi.

had reached England and w3?s well
received. But the most important news |
w the appoir.tmout of a special minister]

. ment of ail difficulties between the two I
?; governments. The appointment was;
given to Lord Ashburton, lately if not 1
stilt one of the House of Barings & Co. J
so welt, and so favorably known in this
country. We copy below the coitunents
of two of the English journals on the
jsubject of this appointment.

Lord Asburton's appointment ha9 been
favurtrbly received in commercial circles,
-and given a tone of conti.iajiee to the
iholders of stale stocks. His lordship's
appointment will be acceptable to the
Americans, as the Messrs. Barings have

engaged in American affairs, and, in fact,
ibe agents of the American government
in monetary operations. His lordship is
. t?oside* a citizen of the great republic,
and one of the largest landed proprietors,
sloo, in the state of Pennsylvania. His
talents as a man of busing* arc well
^ '- Jknowii. He is one of the largest house.holders
in the U. Stales, and lady Ashbur tuu
(late Miss Bingham) is an American
birth. Well versed in the history aod j
value of state bonds, and of the peculiar !
*frur'ture of the American Constitution,
he will be able to press upon (be attention

From an editorial paragraph of the hi
Temperance Advocate introductory to* (},
an article in the preceding columns, taken er
from the Kentucky Farmer, it appears pr
that some of the Western hog drovors n(]
have been selling pigs for Berkshires in th
the upper districts of this State, which v?
have little or no Berkshire blood in their (0
? TKa nnwr districts are not the j m
vuiim* ? >iv [? - __
only part of the State, nor this.the only /
state, in which similar impositions have
been practised. Persons who wish hUod- jy
ed stock of any kfn'd can huve security g|
of obtaining them genuine and pure, but rp
by applying to breeder* of established (u
reputation. The West is not the part of j)(
tfie country front which they can he jy
bought at low prices. There livestock j ^
is the stapje product, and the most vain J- [ pi
hie varieties are yet so scarce, and the |
demand for them so great, that (he prices j j,|
at which they are sold are much higher i j;l
(Han tlie prices in the Eastern and MiiMh- | ??f
Stales.
The only newspaper paragraph which wj
we have seen in any degree approving the
inte mob in Cincinnati, is the following ^
" - * -H. -.11 I
from a paper printed m fayeueviiie caned
the North Carolinian* . :
Let this be a warning to other Banks',?
The people are not goin? to stand thw non- re
resumption game much longer-; at .Vast tlujy <?j

and will hare them, by fair means if (hey can,

The character of the "01! North Stale" th

so un.arohical tendency. |)fl
Since the a-wve was pnt it type we sa
have received tiie fast week's South Caro- 0.
Union tvhich contains an article of sortie a
length on this subject, from which we an
in?ke two extracts as follows: th<
thi: sKorxxtxo or tbb kxd ! ro<
The mid of the present corrupt and vicious (j0
Bunking system has begun, and began as we 1
avo for i lie Uhi ton years repeatedly declared "
it would do, if a proper and thorough reform ho

shew that the p^opl^, long oppressed, opt- j 1
raged, and phittiier-'d by thein, and, (from the l"(
manner in which they almost everywhere buy th<
up their Representatives,) losing all hope of co
redress by law, are taking the law into their pa
own hands?a result always inevitable. As
long as a hope of red rebs by law remained, ro
the peop'e peaceably and quietly submitted ca
but he must be stupid indeed, who expects a tei
continuance of such submission, from a free Wi
people, when all such hope is at. an end. The ^
Bank minions and their presses throughout the
c uritry, who have driven the people to these on
excesses, may now raise their hands, turn up tin
the whites of their eyes, and moralize most so
fbently, on th( horrors of mobs, and the virtu- nr
es of law and order But it wont do.
Dont talk, then of the People's disregard
for the law, till you make their vile plunderers, W(
the Banks, obey b .* And where is ihe single bo
Legislature thai has done this, to the extent Q<
it ought ! '? nig Stale h?ts done much, but cfi
nocso much as it should have dut.e ; anvi what
has been the result of its attempt to control UWI
the Banks* Haye they not combined against j do
it, the law, and the majesty of the People? p(
attempted to place themselves above all law,
and subject the People to *iieir will?and so
lar, been sustained even by the Judiciary it5 cn
sell? Are not these startling thiugs to witness ne
in a free State; and is it not evident, as sug- th<
gested by our patriotic and honest hearted m,
Governor, that if the Sovereign right to control
these arrogant institutions were improvi- ct
denlly lost in law, it would, in the absence .of
any other resort, be reclaimed by Revolut on? |>e
Can any one believe that the people of South hji
Carolina would hesitate to fee themselves by
the strong arm, il necessary, from :heupgrading
and oppressive thraldou of a self constituted
and unlimited Bank despotism ?
We do not suppose it to be the design of l'?
the Carolinian to excite any part of tho ^
people either of this or any adjoining ' a
state to njob violence. The editor knows j?*
the character of onr people too well to C
believe such a thing could be done even i>Pl
if he wished it. But if ho did wish it tlt
such as the above would he the language ,n*
VJ'
forhitn touse. So far from its hemp the 4
case that any of the banks in this State
have ? combined against it, the law and
- tio
the majesty ?l the people, attempted to
set them salves tip against all law,- and
subject the people to their will,'" the jM
hanks have only taken a legal aland in
support of their plain, legal and just
rights. Ze
They once, with the general approba- ^
tionof the community, announced to the
public their inability to pay specie on de- *
maud for their notes, without distressing ex
their numerous debtors to an extent much
beyond what they were willing to do ?,
For this not a breath of censure was q(
heard at the timo from aov quarter.? ja
Thousands of wealthy individuals of as ^
good credit then and now, as any men ;eJ
m the country, and connected with no bU
v ^ SkU "
nks" labored under precisely the sums j
ibiiity. Why are they not maligned j
"combining against the state, the law |
(I the majesty of tlS?'people?" Their
bility boitriri law otidjustice was preiely
the same. Every irian ofcommon
telHgence knows that the liability of
igle individuals, an'ci of partners in buless,
whether as merchants, meehnmcs
hanks, is precisely the same, and the
oce.s9 of collecting debts from them the
me. There never has been a lime in
>uth Carolina when a Imnk ccufd not
u,? onv hnblur of its notes and the I
OMI/U ?/T ??! i
ecie recovered jti.st as soon and as nasias
a private individual could. Nor
?esany man suspect that any hank in
estate, if sued, would make illegal romance.
All men of common sense and
their senses, know that the hanks retried
as soon as they could do so consisn?ly
with the public interest. If they
id refused to suspend when they did, or
id resumed sooner, the public and not
ey would have been the greater sufl*e?'s.
For persuing a course which all np*
oved at the time, and reasonable men
w admit to have been proper, and which
e Legislature itself sanctioned, this
'ry Legislature, afterwards undertook
' visit them with arbitrary illegal and
constitutional punishment. The qiti*
ins who constituted the hanks under*
finding their rights, and determined hko
eetnen to maintain them, resist this flurant
attempt to tyrannise over them,
hey appeal to the law and to the constiition
established by "the majesty of the
?op!e," as the supreme Jaw of the land,
?r the security of their rights. And for
lis their unquestioned right and their
ain doty, they are now charged with
iheMion against "the majesty of thcpeoe/'
Because they have a;>pealed to the 1
w, they 8re charged with attempting to !

No community can sustain itself
which trifles with or denies its plighted
faith. The promises of the Slate ought
to be more" sacred than tho promises of

by process of law, which the state
secures to the citizens, to pay his debts
and fulfil his obligations. The Sutto

ter than fur her to closo her courts of justice,
and withuld from the honest and injured

in determining the liability of the State, j
Being a question of honorary not of legal
responsibility, there is no room for distictions
and technical objections which
might be appropriate in controversies he.
twecn man and man. ' .the safe rule is
the honest one. When innocent third
persons, trusting to the public faith, apparently
or actually pledged in the forms of
law and by public agents, have udvanced
their money, the public is and ought
to 1)0 responsible. If public agents, of
whatever grade, betray their trust, let the
penalty fall on those who employ them.not
on those who frusting theni because
they are public agents, can have no effeetual
redress against their employers.?
The instant that n different course is pur.
suod, the magic of the public name is
gone forever, and the. commonwealth is
degraded, not merely to the low levoi of
an individual litigant, but lo tho low level
ot one who, wunoui venturing. 10 wnivu
privilege, is content to justify a breach,
of'faith by a poor technicality.. Fortunatelv
Pensylvania has n^i her the wish
nor the opportunity to pursue such a
course. Her debt was contracted in
good faith for the construction ol her puh.
lie works, which have added more to the
intrinsic vulueofthe State than their actual
cost. That wns incurred ou accor.
ding to the constitution and laws. No
faithless agent has intercepted the confix
dence of those who trusted u?. Every
dollar-which our creditors have lent us has
gone into our Treasury; and for every
dollar, principal and interest, thus 'caned,
do her cinzens and the constituted authorities
consider thernselver answerable."
