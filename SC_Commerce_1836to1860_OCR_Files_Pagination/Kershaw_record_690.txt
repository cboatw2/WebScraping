VF.TO MESSAGE.
To th? lloitse r.f Re pre sen (a tires ofthe U. Stales:
~ It is with unfeigned regret that I find myself
under the necessity of rot urn in? to the House of
Representatives, with my objections. a bill entitled
"An act to provide revenue from imports,
and to change and modify existing laws, imposing-duties
on imports, and f>>r other purposes."
Nothing can be mere painful to any individual
railed upon to perform too chief executive da
tics under our limited Constitution, than to DC
constrained to withhold his assent from an important
measure adopted by the Legislature.?
Yet ho would neither fulfil the high purposes of
his station, nor consult the true interests or the
solemn will of the people?'lie common cor.sti-1
tuents of both branches of ihc Government?by j
yielding hir well-considered, most deeply fixed, [
and repeatedly declared opinions on matters of
great public, concernment, to those of a co-ordi- j
nate department, without requesting that department
seriously to re-exninine the subject of
gi their difference. The exercise of some indepenh
dence of judgment in regard to all acts of legislation,
is plainly implied in the responsibility of
*\"4 approvingthem. At all times a duty, it becomes
a peculiarly solemn and impressive one when
the subjects passed upon bv Congress happen to j
involve, as in the present instance, the most mor
mentous issues; to affect variously the various
parts of a great country; and to have given rise,!
in all quarters, lo such a Conflict of opinions as j
to render it impossible to conjecture, with any!
K ^ certainty, on which side the majority really is. I
'' '^ Surely, if the pause for reflection intended by
the wise authors of the Constitution, by referring j
,-Y the subject back to Congress for re-consideration,
be ever expedient and necessary, it is in precisely
such a case as the present.
On the subject of distributing the proceeds of
the sales of the public lands, in the existing state
of the finances, if has been my duty to make
known my settled convictions on various occasions
dicing the present session of Congress.? ,
*?nf t|,p extra session, upwards of i:
./II U1C U|;cuiu- v. v..~ ----twelve
months ago, sharing fully in the general 1
hope of returning prosperity and credit, I rccommend
such a distribution; but tliat recommendation
was even then expressly coupled with the 1
condition that the duties on imports should noi
exceed the rate of 20 per cent, provided by the 1
compromise act of 1833. These hopes were not '
a little encouraged, and these views strengthen- <
h ed, by the report of Mr. Ewing, then Secretary i
g of the Treasury, which was shortly thereafter <
laid before Congress, in which he recommended '
the imposition of duties at the rate of 20 per cent. '
ad valorem on all free articles, with specified exceptions;
and stated, "if this measure be adopted, <
there will he received into the treasury from cus- <
toms, in the last quarter of the present venr, 11
(1841,) 85,300,000; in all of the year i842,1 >
about .$22,500,(MX); and in the year 1843, after [ |
the final reduction under the act of March 2,18- 33,
about S20.S00,000;" and adds, "it is believed, 1
after the heavy expenditures required bv the '
public service in tbe present year shall have been t
provided for, tharevenue which will accrue from i
that, or a nearly proximate rate of duty, will be
sufficient to defray the expenses of the Govern- [
ment, and leave a surplus to he annually applied j c
to the gradual payment of the national debt, leav- {i

nappy tliat Congress, at the time, seemed entire- i j
in tPp recommendations of tlie Exe-1
AJ IV
cutive; and, anticipating the correctness of the 1
- Secretary's conclusions, and in view of an actu*
al surplus, passed the distribution act of the 4th
of September last, wisely limiting its operation
to two conditions?having reference, both of 1
them, to a public state of the treasury, different j
from that which had been anticipated by the Secretary
of the Treasury, and to the paramount necessities
of the pubic service. It ordained that
if, at any time during the existence of that act, 1
there should be an imposition of duties on imports
inconsistent with the provisions of the act
of 2d March, 1833, and beyond the rate of duties (
fixed by that act, (to wit, 20 per cent on the val- t
ue of such imports, or any of them,) then the I
distribution should he suspended, and should con <
tinue so suspended, until that cause should be
removed. By a previous clause it had, in a like f
spiritofwise and cautions patriotism, provided J
for another case, (in which all arc even now i
agreed,) that the proceeds of the sales of the t
public lands should be used for the defence of i
the country. It was enacted that the act should
continue and be in force until otherwise provi- I
ded by law, unless the United States should he i
come involved in war with any foreign power; <
in which event, from the commencement of hos- i
tilities, the art should be suspended until the i
cessation of hostilities. j
Not long after the openingof the present ses- !
eion of Congress, the unprecedented and. extra- i
ordinary difficulties that have recently embar- i
rassed the finances of the country, began to assume
a serious aspect. It soon became quite ?
evident that the hopes under which the act of 4th 1
September was passed, and which alone justi- <
fied it in the eyes either of Congress wlio im- i
posed, or of the Executive who approved the i
first of the two conditions just recited, were not ]
destiped to he fulfilled. Under the pressure, i
therefore, of the embarrassments which had thus i
unexpectedly arisen, it appeared to me that the
course to be pursued had been clearly marked
out for the Government by that act itself. The
j:.: in if. nR reoiiirinir a sus
COIlUIUOil , -_-j_ 0
pension of its operation had occurred. It became
necessary, in the oj?inio?is of all, to raise the rate
of duties upon imports above 20 per cent.; and
with a view both to provide available means to
meet present exigencies, and to lay the foundation
for a successful negotiation of a loan, I felt
-S- it incumbent upon me to urge upon Congress to
raise the duties accordingly, imposing them in a
, . . spirit of wise discrimination, for the two-fold ob*
*'ject of affording ample revenue for the Government,
and incidental protection to the various
branches of domestic industry. I also pressed,
in the most eniphat jJaut respectful language 1
could employ, the i^iessiiy of making the land
sales available to the treasnry, as the basis of
^ public credit. I did not think that I could stand
'^excused, much less justified, before the people
; of the United Stales, nor could I reconcile it to
myself, to recommenckLhe imposition of addition-1
al taxes upon theoi^ without, at the same time, j
purging the employment of all the legitimate :
'"'meansof-thaGoverhrnont towards satisfying its!
v,ant?. These opinions were communicated in i
* advance of any definite action of Congress on
ihe subject either of the tariuor land sales, under
a high of public duty, arid in compliance
with an express injunction ol the Constitution;
so that if a collision (extremely to be deprecated
as such Collisions always are) lias seemingly
arisen between the Executive and J-egisn
lative branches of the Government, it has assuredly
ijot been owiug to any capricious ipterfe

ecntive, as it had undoubtedly a right to do; and !
passed a bill virtually Tor a time repealing the
proviso of the act of "the 4th September, 1841.
The bill was returned to the House in which it
originated, with my objections to its becoming a
law. With a view to prevent, if possible, an
open disagreement of opinion on a point so
important, I tool; occasion to declare that I regarded
it as an indispensable prerequisite to an
increase,6Tduties above 20 per cent., that the act
of the 4th'Septcr,iber should remain unrepealed
in its provisions. My reasons for that opinion
were elaborately set "forth in the message which
accompanied the return of the bill?which no
constitutional majority appears to have been
found for passing into a law.
The hill which is now before me proposes,
in its 27th section, the total repeal of one of
the provisoes in the act of September; and,
while it increases the duties above 20 per cent.,
directs an unconditional distribution of the land
proceeds. I am therefore, subjected a second
time, in the period of a few days, to the necessity
of cither giving my approval to a measure
which, in my deliberate judgment, is in
conflict with great public interests, or of returning
it to the House in which it originated,
with iny objections. With all my anxiety for
the passage of a law which would replenish an
exhausted treasury, and furnish a sound and
healthy encouragement to median cal industry,
I cannot consent to do so at the sacrifice of the
peace and harmony of the country, and the
clearest convictions of public duty.
For some of the reasons whieb have brought
me to this conclusion, I refer to my previous
messages to Congress, and briefly subjoin the
following:?
1. The bill unites two subjects, which, so far
from having any affinity to one another, are
wholly incongruous n their chara> t :r.'"i It is bot i
a revenue and an appropriation bill. It thus
imposes on the Executive, in the first place,
the necessity of either approving that which he
would reject, or rejecting that which he' might
otherwise approve. This is a specie of constraint
to which the judgment of the Executive
ought not, in my opinion, be subjected. But
that is not my only objection to the ac; in its
present form. The union of subjects wholly
dissimilar in their character in the small bill, if"
it grew into a practice, would not fail to lead to
consequences destructive of all wise and consoinntioiis
legislation. Various measures, each
' " * "~e>
igrccable only to a small minority, might by being
thus united, (and the more, the greater
bianco of success,) lend to the passing of laws,
which no single provision could, if standing alone,
lommand a majority in its favor.
2. While the treasury is in a state of extreme
embarrassment, requiring every dollar which it
;an make available; and when the Governmcut
us not only to lay additional taxes, but to borrow
money to meet pressing demands, the bill
jrososes to give away a fruitful source of revenue
?which is the same thing as raising money by
oan and taxation?not to meet the wants of the
aovernment, but for distribution: a proceeding
which I must regard as highly impolitic, if no:
inconstitutional.
A brief review of the present condition of the I
>ublic finance will serve to illustrate the true I
:ondit.ion of the treasury, and.exhibit its actual
lccessities. On the 5th of August, (Friday last,)
here was in the treasury, in round nmnhors, I

September, 1841 040,000

"V' ^"" i
Leaving an available amount of .970,000 :
The Navy Department had drawn requisitions
>n the treasury, at that time, to meet debts ac-"
ually due; among which are bills under protest
or SI,414,000?thus leaving an actual deficit of
51-14,000.
There was on hand about S100,000 of unissued
treasury notes, assisted by the accruing
everiue, (amounting to about ?150,000 per
veek, exclusive of receipts on unpaid bonds,)
omect requisitions for the army, and the dcnands
of the civil list.
The withdrawal of the sum of ?640,000, to
jc distributed among the States, as soon as the
statements and accounts can be made up and
rompleted, by virtue of the provisions of the
tct of the 4th of September last, (of which
merely a moiety goes to a few States, and only
lhout ?683,000 is to oe divided among all the
States,) while it adds materially to the embarrassments
of the treasury, affords to the States
no decided relief.
No immediate relief of this state of things is !

be deplored) the Government could be reconciled
to the negotiations of loans already authorised
by law, at a rate of discount ruinous in itself,
and calculated most seriously to affect the
public credit So great is the depression of
trade, that even if the present bill were to become
a law, and prove to be productive, some
time would elapse before sufficient supplies !
would flow into the treasury, while, in the mean j
time, its embarasstnents would be continually ;
augmented by the semi-annual distribution ofj
the land proceeds.
Indeed, there is but too much ground to be ;
apprehended that, even if this bill were permit- (
od to become a Jaw?alienating, as it does, the1
proceeds of the land sales?an actual deficit in
the treasury would occur, which would more
than probably involve the necessity of a resort
to direct taxation.
Let it be remarked, that $5,500,000 of the
public debt becomes redeemable in about two
years and a half, which, at any sacrifice, must
be met; while the treasury is always liable to
demands fur the payment of outstanding treasury
notes. Such is the gloomy picture which
our financial department now presents, and
which calls for the exorcise of a rigid economy
in the public expenditures, and the rendering
available of all the means within the control ?>i J
the Government I most respectfully submit
whether this is a time to give away the proceeds
of the land sales, when the public, lands constitute
a fund which of all others, may be made
most useful in sustaining the public credit. Can
the Government be generous and munilicent to
others, when every dollar it can command is
necessary to supply its own wants] And ii
Congress would not nesuaie to suuer mc yiu?jsions
of tlie act of the 4th September last to remain
unrepealed, in case the country was involvin
war, is not the necessity for such a course
now just as imperative as it would be then?
3 A third objection remains to he urged, whictr
would be sullicient, in Itself, to induce me to return
the bill to the House with my objections,
By uniting two subjects so incongruous as a tariff

land distribution, it inevitably makes the fate of
the one dependent upon that of the other, in future
contests of party. Can anything be moro'i
fatal to the merchant"or manufacturer than such
an alliance? What they most of all require is a
system of moderate duties, so aranged as to withdraw
the tariff question, as far as possible, completely
from the arena of political contention.?
The chief want is permanency and stability ?
Such an increase of the tariff"I believe to be necessary,
in order to meet die economical expenditures
of Government. Such an increase, made |
in the spirit of moderation and judicious discrimination,
would, I have no doubt, be ontirely satisfactory
to the American people. In the way of
accomplishing a measure so salutary and so imperatively
demanded by every public interest,
the legislative department will meet with a cordial
co-operation on the part of the Executive.?
This is all that the manufacturers can desire,
and it would be a burden readily borne by the
people. But I cannot too earnestly repeat, that,
in order to be permanent, it must command general
acquiescence. But can such permancy be
justly hoped for, if the tariffquestion be coupled
with that of distribution?as to which a serious
* conflict of opiuion exists among the States nand
' ' 1 on r\i\rvt*f l\oro
I llie people; w/iicti enusis in u? ou|.ruil ?*
! majority?if, indeed, there be a majority?of the
II .vo Houses of Congress? What permanency
! or stability can attach to a measure which, warring
upon itself, gives away a fruitful source of
revenue at the moment it proposes a large increase
of taxes on the people! Is the manufacturer
prepared to stake himself and his interests
upon such an issue!
I know lhat it is urged (but most erroneously,
in my opinion) that instability is just as apt to he
! produced retaining the public lands as a source
| of revenue, as from any other cause; and this is
a-cribcd to a constant fluctuation, as is said, in !
the amount of sales. If there be anything hi }
tiris objection, it equally applies to every imposi-!
lion of duties on imports. The amount of re-1
venue annually derived from duties is constantly j
liable to ckmge. The regulations of foreign
Governments, the varying productiveness of otli- j
er countries, periods of excitement in trade, and '
a great variety of other circumstances, are con-1
staully arising to affect the state of commerce,
foreign and domestic, and, of consequence, the
revenues levied upon it. The sales of the public
domain in ordinary times are regulated by fixed
laws, which have tiieir basis in a demand increasing
only in the ratio of the increase of population.
In recurring to the statistics connected
with this subject, it will be perceived that, Cora
period of ten years preceding 1834, the average
amount of land sales did not exceed ?2,000,000
For the increases which took place in 1834-'5
and '(i. we are to look to that peculiar condilion
of the country which grew out of one of the most
extraordinary excitements in business and speculation
that have ever occurred in the history of
commerce and currency. It was the fruit of a
wild spirit of advanture, engendered by a vici-!
ous systemol credits, under the evils of which
the country is still laboring, and which it is fond- 1
Jy hoped will not soon recur. Considering the !
vast amount of investments made by private in-1
dividuals in the public lands during those three !
years, and which equalled ?43, 000, 000, (equal j
to more than 20years' purchase,) taking the avc- j
rage oi sales of the ten preceding years, it may!
be safely asserted that the result of the public

"UjaclulCTt. rri?, 1 p'iniiiry in U1C re- I
venues-, and consequently in the course of the '
Government. j
Under what appears to mc, therefore, the
soundest considerations of public policy, and in
view of the interests of every branch of domestic
industry, I return you the bill, with these my objections
to its becoming a law.
I take occassion emphatically to repeat my
anxious desire toco-operate with Congress in the
passing of a law which, while it shall assist in
supplying the wants of the treasury, and re-es-!
tablish public credit, shall aiibrd to the manufacturing
interests of the country all the incidental 1
protection they require.
After all, theTOllect of what I do is substantially
to call on Congress to reconsider the subject. 1
If, on such reconsideration, a majority of twothirds
of both Houses should be in favor of the
measure, it. will become a law, notwithstanding 1
my objections. In a case of clear and manifest '
error on the part of the President, the presumption
of the Constitution is, that such majorities 1
will l>e found. Should they be so found in this
case, having conscientiously discharged my own
duty, I shall cheerfully acquiesce in the result.

AJiiledgeville, May 27,1W42. \
Dear Sir:?1 had the honor, some time since,
to receive your letter, informing me that the j
House ol Representatives nau passea me apportionment
bill, with a provision requiring the
State Legislatures to lay off* the territory ol their J
respective Stales into Congressional districts; (
and should long ago have answered it, but for
my multiplied engagements, some of which
called me from home, on public business. '
Satisfied that Congress has no authority to is^ (
sue this mandate to the State Legislatures, I \
spoil determined that, if the bill should become ,
a law, 1 would not convene the General Assentbly
to carry it into effect. Whatever Congress '
might constitutionally do in rpgard to the ina-)j
king or altering the regulations (as to the time, 1
places, and manner ol holding the elections ot j 1
Representatives) it has no authority to direct.
State legislat-iou on the subject, in fact, the pow- j
er conferred by the Constitution on Congress was ,
to prevent the catastrophe that might ensue, j
upon the failure or refusal of the Legislatures of!
the States to provide by law for holding these i'

would render it necessary for Congress to exer-!
cise the power given in the Constitution; though ; (
1 entertain no question that, the authority being I (
given, Congress has 110 right to determine 011 (
the expediency of usinc it. But it is absurd '
to suppose that a State would obey a mandate
from Congress on this cubject, alter it had re- '
solutely resolved either to enact no law for hold- J
ing elections for Representatives in Congress,
or to repeal laws already enacted. The framers '
ol the Constitution were not guilty of so great a
lolly as to suppose that the Legislature ot a
State would-*couiply with a requisition of Congress
to do an act that it had previously determined
it would not do. Hence they gave to
Congress all necessary authority to do uic act,
if the State should reluse; or to alter the act, if
it should be so done by the State as to be iin
pracucaoie 01 execution. liut, conceuing me
point that Congress his the authority to direct
State Legislation in regard to the limes, places,
and manlier of holding these elections: ,s the
power conferred to direct the districting of the
Psamn section and clause which
ogress the power to prescribe or

same airthority in regard to the election of Senators.
DoeiP'ihe manner of holding an elefctiori
jpean one thing when used in regard to Senators,
and a different thing when used in reference
to Representatives! If Congress can either
divide the State into districts, or order it to be
done, can it not, with equal propriQttg bisect
the Legislature, and say that one mK representing
one geographical division of the State
shall filect one Senator, and the other half sbliil
elect tlie other] There is as much authority for
one as the other. It might be said, in reply to
this view, that the Constitution declares that
the Senators shall be chosen by the Legislatures.
True. It also says that.the members of the
House of Representatives shall be elected by
the people of the several States. If all the
members of the Legislature have the right to
vote for Senators, and cannot be controlled either
by Congress or the State Legislature itself;
so ail the neonle have the ritrht to vote for the
whole complement of members of the House
of Representatives to which the State may be
entitled alike independent of this control. Representatives,
when chosen, represent the State,
and not any particular district of a State; and
any law which deprives a constituent of the
privilege of voting for all his Representatives,
infringes constitutional right
Again: alter a State is laid out into-congressicnal
districts, no election can be held, until the
times, places, and manner of holding elections
are proscribed. If you prescribe the time, as
the lirst Monday in October?places, as the
court-houses of the counties respectively composing
the district; no election can be held, until
you prescribe the manner, also?as viva voce,
by ballot, who shall preside/ how returns shall
be made and the results certified.
I assume it as incontrovertible, that the object
of the Constitution was to prevent a dissolution
of Congress by the contumacy of the
States in refusing to provide for holding the elections'.
It could never have been contefnplated
to divide the otates into districts'as a means of
prevent,ng this evil. It is more likely that the
people of some districts, in times of great excitement,
would refuse to elect members, than
that all the people of the State should enter into
a comination. liven if a majority of the people
should reluse to vole under the general ticket
system, a minority would still elect the full
representation to which the State is entitled,
regardless of the voluntary disfranchisement ot
the majority. -This suggests a&Qbjection which
might be urged with great propriety against the
j Qnnnooo como Afatrint fchnill/1
UlSti iGl r-y OLCIXI* KJUj/jJVOt. uumw Wi|9?t twv ??? ?
reluse lo return, members; is the. State to lose
a part of its representatives.' Because a portion
ot the people prove refactory, it is no reason
why the balance should be deprived of their
rights. The district system might conflict, too,
with the principle that, in the popular branch
of the National Legislature, the majority of
the whole people of the State should be represented.
You may easily imagine that, in a districted
State,,a majority ol the members might
be elected by a minority of the people. The
election in Ave districts in a State composed of
eleven, might be carried in one way by overwhclmning
majorities; while the election in the
other six might be carried the other way by slender
majorities. .
These are objections based upon expediency,
and opposed to the district system, whether
adopted by the National or Sfaip Legislatures,
uui uiey go aiso to wrr.<i. me position, ^ tbn
Constitution, in giving to Congress the power
of prescribing the manner of holding elections,
never conferred an authority to place the Government
in the hands of a minority of the people?which
might be easily accomplished under
the district system.

Thrilling- Incident.?Col. Jno. McDonald,
of Ross county, at a public dinner, related the
following touching incident: In 1787 Wheeling
was besieged bya large army of British and Indians.
So suddenly was the attack made that
no time was offered for preoararion The fort, at
the time of the assault, was commanded by Col.
Silas Zane; Col. Ebenezer Zane, the senior officer,
was in a block-house some fifty or one hundred
yards outside of the wall. The enemy
made several desperate assaults to break into
the fort, but on every onset they were driven
back. The amunilion for the defence of the fort
was deposited in the block-house, and the attack
was made so suddenly and unexpectedly that
there was no time to remove it. On the afterNoon
of the second day of the siege, the powder
in the fort was nearly exhausted, and no alternative
remained but that some one must pass
through the enemy's fire to the block-house for
powder. When Silas Zane made the proposi:ion
to the men, to see if any one would undertake
the hazardous enterprize, at first all weresilent

While they were disputing about who should

arojther thought she would llinch from the enterprize,
but he was mistaken. She had the intrepidity
to dare and the fortitude to bear her up in
the heroic risk of life. Her brother then tried to
Jissuade her from the attempt by saying a man
would be more fleet and consequently would run
less risk of loosing his life. She replied that

ol her clothing as would impede her speed, and
ran till she arrived at the door of the block-house,
where her brother, Col. Zane, hastened to receive
his intrepid sister. The Indians, when
they saw her bound forth, did not fire a gun, but
called alour', "Squaw, squaw, squaw!" When
she had told her brother the errand on which she
caine, he took a table cloth and fastened it
around her waist, and poured into it a keg of
powder. She then sallied back to the fort with
all the buoyancy of hope. The moment she was
outside of the block-house the whole of the enemy's
line poured a leaden storm at her, but the
balls went whistling by without doing her any
injury. She afterwards married a Mr. Clairville,
of Ohio.

STEAMElt KERSHAW. '
We invite the attention of our citizens to the advertisement
of Mr. Hillard, proposing to navigate
the Wateree by steam, the coining season..
Notwithstanding the difficulties which hav?5gre- tofore
presented themselves in the way of'steam
navigation on our river, for ourselwe, wej*hhve
never doubted for a moment, its entire practicability.
The Camden which was . unfortunately"
lost a few years since, was not" constructed in .
such a manner as to warrant, in any greatdegree,
the hope of success, but from what we learn of
the Kershaw we do not doubt, but the expe^HjJIfent
will prove eminently satisfactory, so far las proving
the adaption of our river to steam navigation
is concerned, and we trust our merchants ^
will make it profitable to the ente^^^g pro- ^

"If this bill had been signed by the President,
every thing that had passed would h^ve been
forgotten and forgiven. The reconcilement;
would have been the harbinger of jjd'qgs and prosperous
