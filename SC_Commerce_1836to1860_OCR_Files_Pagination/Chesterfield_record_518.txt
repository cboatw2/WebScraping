rFo' ifumof Crops.?I see there is a
pre'uium offered for the best rotation of
crops ; therefore 1 shall make but a few
remarks on this subject. In no case
should a farmer take more than two crops
< ff grain off thin land before it putting
ir down to grass, and whatever the rotalion
may be plough in a green crop where
practicable, instead of an open fallow.
'Hiis will make the soil mellow and loose,
and add considerably to its strength.
' P
In-conclusion, I beg leave to remark,
that there are many ways in which land
could be sooner improved than by" the j
plans I have just mentioned ; but I have
given the cheapest and easiest plan for j
those who are deficient in means. Being
more accustomed to handle the plough j
and hoe than the pen, I am aware that the
directions I have given, might be put in
better form, to appear to advantage ; but I ,
I' ave it to the committee to make such
disposal of it as to tnem may seem u: si.

Messrs Gay lord ane Tucker?I have
noticed in the late numbers of the Cultivator,
Dr. Guthreie's and IVIr. Bement's
attacks on the sugar beet, insinuating
that it is almostaworthless rootfor the feeding
of stock; and as the opinions of these
gentlemen, with partial experiments, are
directlv at varience to those of the most
eminent agriculturists of France and Germany,
after an experience of more than
thirty years, and to those of many of our
countrymen, after trying it with satisfactory
effect aboutfive years; and as I hadthe
honor ofappearing in the last May number
of the Cultivator, strongly recommending
its production ar d feeding, I fetl bound to
make some comments on the commucacions,
and reiterate my own experience in '
the feeding qualities, of what I consider 1
one of the most valuable roots.
I am perfectly satisfied by Dr. G's statement
of the analysis that he made of the
beet. vol. viii. page 40, that he was either
grossly imposed upon in the purchase of
seedand had grown themangel wratzel instead
of the white Silesian, or that he had
planted it in so rich a vegetable soil as to
produces sorank a growth asto almost to.
tally destrovthe saccarinc matterthat is usuallvj
found in it, especially when he adds,
** the beetj brought upon our table are to- !
talJJy destitute of sweetness." Now I
not only my own taste for three years in
succession to prove that the sugar beets J
raised in and about Buffalo, are exceed- (
inglysweet and nutricious, but can also
bring a hundred witnesses any time to
corroborate the assertion, from their own
daily eating. The famous blood beet
cannot compare with the sweet, tender
ssifiutan. and as for mangel wurtzel and '
? ? - - f
other beets* they are almost tasteless after
them: and they are nevor boiled in a
pot by themselves, that there is not a ;
sweet syrup lei* at the botorn, almost of
fhot hickness and agreeable taste of sugar- j
molasses,' which, in my opinion, only
wants to be clarified and graduated, to i
make good sugar. So much for personal
rate of experience; now foe that ot stock.
^ know that fed raw to cows, they cgnsid- j
erably added to the quantity and espuci- '
ally the quality of the milk, making 1ho
butter as sweet, and almost of yellow as
is produced on fresh summer's grass: they
also kept them,' with the addition of hay
alone, in the best possible order; and the
yong stock fed on them, togetcr with hay,
were as fit and almost as tine and slossy in
their coats, 8* when on the best of sumjner
pasture. I never tried them w tli horses, hut
should hfrdlv think them hearty food enough
f?r those at work. Not keeping sheep, of
course I could not experimentwitu them : but
others speak verv flattering on this point, as.
? ?? * g wart* I
may fiave^oeen seen irmu ?oui' | umu.u.. v? ? ?
thai went ihe round til ' year past in most of
the agricultural papers copied, I think, from
the Phi adelphia Cabinet. Beets there were
said to produce the best of roatton and the
finest of wool. ' *
The most important use, howev> r, that I
have made of them, is with hocrg. But as my
breeds embrace only the China and Bei k Inre,
it is i I reference to these superior ani.
mats alone that 1 can speak ; and here it
seems that Dr GufhriesS Berkshires did tolerably
well, while his others almost starved.
The first winter my i rown swine partly on
potatoes. raw . the second winter almost ex- ;
clusively on raw beets, thrown to them on the j
ground. I did not notice any difference j
whatever in their appearance during these j
two seasons, but each time they were kept
jn as good flesh as 1 ever wish to have breeders,
and they were by no means allowed to
cat their fill of them either. The third w inter,
(the last) have erected a steaming appar
atus, with a new ptggory, 1 commenced cooking
the fi?od for rny hogs, and have frequently
steamed beets alone and fen them to all ages,
frcin the pig two months old, lip to the grown
animal of four years. To the last, I had to
st nt them to a common water pail, half full ,
twice a day, or say from eight to ten quarts, I
<>r they would get too fat for breeding ; and as ;
to the former, with the addition of a trifling
quanti'y of corn, I never s?w animals thrive 1
bettor, of more contented in my life. They |
would till th? ir bellies and lie down in theii
straw, and dose away for hours together, as j
contented as puppies and as whist as mice;
and this stock thus treated, lam not afraid
to show, either for general size or fineness of
point, against any liung in the United States,
saving my late importation, and that only for
great weight these last being somewhat of a
f..?. .,1,011 ta 110110! amnnrr Rprkshifci.
J11 I VII*? ! ir? uouai mii"n^ ??v? .? During
this same winter I steamed a mixture
of carrots and potatoes with the beets occasionally,
but in feeding I found that as a genoral
rule, the pigs would pick out the beets
first, the potatoes second, and only eat the
carrots when hungry at last ;*but if any one
were to ask which I thought the most nutritious,
I should say the potato without doubt.
My accommodations are too limited, however,
to make hhe careful experiment as to the
relative value of roots, bushel for bushel, and
again in comparison with grain, as requested
by Ml-. Caton, of Illinois but f trust that the
afeove will be satisfactory to him and to others
so far as it goes, for it is experience and n >t
theory. I must say that I do not like this
jumping at conclusions from partial experi#jH?Mrts..
I recollect reading an address, some
two years ago, by some one in Pennsylvania,
fcvfocq-an agricultural society, in which the
ttrfof maintained?and he seemed to be an
imqfligvnt, acie/ittfic man?that rata baga, by
5IIH55HBHHH5SSHHSH**
analysis, was but little e'sn than wood, and
therefore, as a food for* man and beast, it was
almost totally worthies* I ideed I And yet
this sant^ despised root, together witn S little
straw, makes most of the English beef and
million, and in Rom instances at times onefourth
supports its laboring population. Appr<>pns
to th-s, I recollect once tellwg an intelligent
neighbor that I cultivated pumpkins
a good deal, and iiked them much as food for
swine. 44 Well," he replied, "tlicy never did
anything for my hogs but scour them.'* The
fact was he had an inferior breed of animals.
Again, [ shut up some Berkshire sows thai
were quire poor, about three weeks, to put
them in condition ; they were allowed nothing
but pumpkins during this time, and were then
turned out, having got real'v, in that 6hort,
time, almost too fat for good breeding. An
intelligent gentleman who had seen -hem previous
to thefr being shut up, and then'- again
when they were let out, acknowledged that
nothu g but seeing the thing with his own eyes
woukl have convinced him >>f the truth of it.
and wound ur> by adding, (I do not give the
words exactly, but the ideas,) "why instead
of fatting them, iheti ine thuhave made th -in
skele.on poor by this."?I am no chemist,
and therefore humbly ask, what would be the
ana Ivsis of clover ? N?' much, I fancy, but
water. And vet Berkshires, and in fact, all
good crosses of.the Cum* hog, wi.'l k* ep fat

this long letter on stig ir beets bv
saying, that if their stock does not thrive upon
them, why then gentlemen have been deceived
in their seed, or they have not got the right,
sort of animals to consume the loots.
Like Judge Garueit, ot Virginia, I have oc.

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
On Tuesday June 1. the President of
the United States bansmitted to both
Houses of Congress the following Message:
To the Senate and House o f Reprcsentativcs
of the Unife-l Stages:
Fellow-Citizkns : You have been
assembled in your respective halls of legislation
under a proclamation bearing the
signature of the illustrious citizen who
was so lately called by the direct suffrages
of the People to the discharge of the important
functions of their chief executive
office. Upon the expiration of a single
month from the day of his installation, he
has paid the -great debt of Nature, leaving
behind him a name associated with the 1
recollection of numerous benefits confer- 1
red upon the country duringa long life of
patriotic devotion. With this public bereavement
are connected other considerations
which will not escape the attention 1
of Congress. The preparations necessa- J
ry for his removal to the scat of Govern,
ment in view of a residence of four years J
must have devolved upon the late President
heavy expenditures, which, if permit,
ted to burden the limited resources of his 1
private fortune, may tend seriously to the 1
embarrassment of h a surviving family; '
and it is therefore respectfully submitted 1
to Congress whether the ordinary princi- I
pies of justice would not dictate the pro- '
prietv of its legislative interposition. By | _
the provisions of the fundamental law,
the powers and duties of the high station 1
to which he was elected have devolved (
upon tne, and in the dispositions of the '
representatives of the States and of the
People will be found, to a great extent, 1
a solution of the problem to which our in- i '
stitutions are for the first time subjected. '
In entering upon the duties of this of. <
fice, I did not feel that it would be bo- '
coining in me to disturb what had been 1
ordered by my lamented predecessor.? <
Whatever therefore may have been my 1
opinion, originally, as to the propriety of- '
^ -- -- ?i.. _ \i~.. !
convening Lonjjress hi h? ?r<iuy ? u?y
from that of its late adjournment, I found 1
a new and a controlling inducement not :
to interfere with the patriotic desires of
the late President, in the -novelty of the <
situation in which I was so unexpectedly 5
placed. My first wish under such circumstances
would necessarily have been to <
hhve called to my aid in the administra- <
tion of public affairs the combined wisdom <
of the two Houses of Congress, in order to <
take their counsel and advice as to the i
best mode of extricating the Government i
and the country from the embarrassments i
weighing heavily on botrt. I am then <
most happy in finding myself so soon after '
my accession to the Presidency surround- i
ed by the immediate Representatives of <
.L j. ,.1 ,
me oimew u?u j wpic.
No imporrant changes having taken j
place in our foreign relations since the i
last Session of Congress, it is not deemed , (
necessary on this occasion to go into a J <
detailed statement in regard to them. I ?
am happy to say that I see nothing to de- '
stroy the hope of being able to preserve ! i
peace. <
The ratification of the treaty with Por- I <
tugal has been duly exchanged between i;
the two Governments. Tjiis Government
has not been inattentive to the interests
of those of our citizens who have i
claims on the Government of Spain found- '
ed on express treaty stipulations, and a i
hope is indulged that the representations j
which have been made to that Govern-1
' - * i ? j
ment on this subject may lean ere long io
beneficial results. i
A correspondence has taken place be. j
tween the Secretary of State and the Win* '
ister of Her Britannic Majesty accredit- <
ted to this Government on the subject of i
Alexander McLeod's indictment and im- i
prisonment, copies of which are herewith i
communicated to Congress i
In addition to what appears from these |
papers, it may be proper to state that Al- I
exander McLeod has been heard by the i
Supreme Court of the State of New York j
on his motion to be discharged from im- !
prisonment, and that the decision of that (
Court has not as yet been pronounced. i
The Secretary of State has addressed i
to me a paper upon two subjects, interest- <
ing to the commerce <\f the country, I
which will receive my consideration, and
vfmarxmmm&mmmmasszammaMummmammmmmmmm
>
r >
which I have the honor to communicate to
Congress. ? y:
So far as it depends on the course of
this Government, our relations of goodwill
and friendship will be sedulously cultivated
with all nations. The true American
policy w II be found to consist in
the exercise of a spirit of justice to be j
manifested in the discharge of all our j
international obligations, to the weakest !
of the family of nations as well as to the
most powerful. Occasional conflicts of
opinion may arise, but when the discus,
sjona incident to them are conducted in
the language of truth and with a strict regard
to justice, the scourge of war will
for the most part be avoided. The time
ought to be regarded as having gone by
when a resort to arms is to be esteemed as
the only proper arbiter of national differences.
The census reccnllv taken shows a
regularly pr >gr> g ive (creases in our pop
ulation. Upon the breaking out of the
war of the Revolution, our numbers
scarcely equaled three millions of souls;
they already exceed seventeen millions,
and will continue to progress in a ratio
which duplicate in a period of about twenty
three-years. The old Slates contain J,
a territory sufficient in itself to maintain !
a population of additional millions, and
the most popuiouse of the new States may c
even vet bo regarded as but partially set- , n
tied, while of - the new lands on this v
side of the.Rocky Mountain tosavnoth- ^
ing of the immense,region which stretch. (
es from the base of the Mountain to the v
Columbia river, about 770.000:000 acres, '
ceded and unceded Still remain to be t
brought into market. . We hold out to the e
people of other countries an invitation to t
come and settle among us as members of j s
our rapidly growing family; and, for the i f
blessings which we offer them, we require t
of them to look upon our country as their ^
country, and to unite with us in the great i ^
lask of preserving our institutions, and t
hereby perpetuating our liberties. No
motive exist for foreign conquest. We ^
desire hut to reclaim our almost' illimitable
wilderness and to introduce into their v
depth the light of civilization. While we *
shall at all times be prepared to vindicate c
the national honor, our most earnest de- n
sire will be to maintained an unbroken 0
peace. . M
In presenting the foregoing views, I
cannot withhold the expression of the t
opinion that there exists nothing in the y
extension of our empire over our acknow- q
ledged possession to excite the alarm of |
the patriot for the safety of our institutions
The Federalist system, leaving to each n
State the care of its domestic concern, c
and devolving on the Federal Govern- 0
ment those of general import, ndmit9 the 0
greatest expansion, but, at the same time, I
I deem it proper to add that there will bs n
found to exist at all times an imperious c
necessity for restraining all the function- u
aries of this Government within the range
jf their respective powers, thereby preser- n
vingajust balance between the powers g
granted to this Government and those re- t
served to the S a eor the people. ^
From the report of the Secretary of the ,
Treasury, you will perceive that the fiscal
means present and accruing areiusuflrcient 8
to supply tho wants of the Government u
for the current year. The balance in the a
Treasury on the fourth day of March last "
not covered bv outstanding drafts, and t!
exclusive of trust funds, is estimated at o
$H60.000. This includes the sum of il
$215,000 deposited in the Mint and its p
branches to procure metal for coining t,
ind in process of coinage, and which j
sould not be withdrawn without incon
I _..u:? r* 1
reili^nve; itaiviug oiii>ji;^i iu man in uig ^
various depositories the sum of 8645,000.
By virtue of two several acts of congress ^
the Secretary of theTr'easury wasauthori- j ^
eedto issue, on andafier the fourth dav of
? _
March last. Treasury notes to the amount
af$5,413,000 making an aggregate avail- n
able fund of 80,058,000 on hand. , *
But this fund was chargeable without- *
standing Treasury notes redeemed in the c
current year and interest thereon to the 0
jstimated amount of five million two hun- 1 p
ired and eighty thousand dollars. There ! o
s also thrown upon the Treasury the pay- j d
nentofa large amount ofdemands accrued g
n whole or in part in former years which ti
will exhaust the available meant of the tl
ITraasurv, and leave the accruing'revenues s
reduced as it is in amount, burdened with
debt and charged with the current expen- .
ses of the Government. The aggregate ^
imount of outstanding appropriations on !he
fourth day of March last was $>33,429,- 1
316 50 of which $-4,210,009 will be rc- u
quired during the current year; and there P
will also be required for the use of the War n
Department additional appropriations to 8
amount of two million five hundred tl
ind thirty.two dollars and ninety-eight t<
cents, the special object of which will be c
seen by reference to the report of the Sec- b
rctary of War. vs
The anticipated means of the Treasury p
are greatly inadequate to this deinend.? n
The receipts from customs for the last tj
three quarters of the last year, and the ^
first quarter of the present year, amounted
to $'2,742,450; showing an average reveO
O tf
nue from both sources of $1236,870 per ?
month. A gradual expension of trade
growing out of a restoration of confidence, R
together with a reduction in the expenses j d
r>f collecting officers, may cause an addi- tl
tion to the montnly recepts from the w
customs- They are estimated for the res- w
idue of the year from the fourth of March j p
at $12,000,000; the receipts from the p
public lands for the same time are estima- $
led at $2,500,000; and from miscellane- a
neous sources at $170,001); making an ag- |
jregateof available fund within the year of
$15,670,000; which will leave a Iprobable ?
deficit of $11,406,132 9S. To meet this n
some temporary provision is necessary, e
until the amount can be absorbed by the C1
jxccss of revenues which are anticipated Y'
to accure at no distant day. P1
There will fall due within the next|r<
hree months Treasury notes of the islue
of 1840, including interest, -about
112,850,000. There is chargeable in the
tame period for arrearages for taking the
lixth census, 8294,000; and the estimated
expenditures for the current service are
ibout 88,100,000, making the aggregate
lemands upon the Treasury, prior to the
irst of September next, about 11,340,000
Dolls. ' (
The ways and means in the Treasury
ind estimated to accrue within the above
lamed period, consists of about 6 94,000
Dolls of funds available on the 29th ulti?
ne; an unissued Balance of Treasury
lotes authorized by the act of 1841.
imounting to 1.955.000, Dolls and estimated
receipts from all sources of 3, 800,300
; Dolls making an aggregate of about
$6,450 000, and leaving a probable deficit
?n the 1st of September next of 84,835,300.
In order to supply the wants of the
Gruvernment, an intelligent constituency
n view of their best interests, will, without
hesitation, submit to all necessary
jurdens. But it is nevertheless imporant
so to impose them as to avoid deeating
the just expectations of the conn,
ry, growing out of pre-existing Iaw9.?
Hie act of 24th March, 1833, commonly
jailed the compromise act, should not be
iltered except uc.der urgent necessities,
vhich are not belinved at this time to exist
)ue year only remawns to complete the series
>f reductions provided for by that law, at
vhich time provisions made by the same
aw, and which then will be brought acively
in aid of the manufacturing inter:sts
of the Union, will not fail to produce
he most beneficial results. Under a
vstem of discriminating duties imposed
or purposes of revenue, in union with
he provisions of existing laws, it is to he
loped that our policy will, in the future,
e fixed and permanent, so as to avoid
hose constant .fluctuations which defeat
he very objects which they have in view.
We shall best maintain a position which,
i hile it will enable us the more rendsly
o meet the advances of other countries
alculated to promote our trade and com.
tierce, will at the same1 time leave in our
wn hands the means of retaliating
fith greater effect unjust regulations.In
intimate connexion with the ques.
ion of revenue is that which makes proision
for a suitable fiscal agent capable
f adding increased facilities in the colaction
and disbursement of the public
svenues, rendering more secure their
ustody, and consulting: a true econmy
in the great multiplied and delicate
perationsof the Treasury Department.
Jpon such an agent depends in an einient
degree the establishment of a curreny
of uniform value, whicliu9 of so great
uportance to all the essential interests
f society ; and on the wisdom to be
lanifested in its creation much depends, j
>o intimately interwoven are its operaions,
not only with the interests of in.
ividuals, but with those of the States,
fiat it may be regarded in a great dcree
as'controlling both. If poper be
sed as the chief medium of circulation
nd the power be vested in the Govern- ^
lent of issuing it at pleasure, either in
he form of Treasury drafts or any other, J
r if banks be used as the public deposlories,
with liberty to regard all surlusses
from day to day as so much added
o their active capital, prices are exposed (
o constapt fluctuations, and industry to \
evere suffering. In the one case, politi- '
nl rrmsirlpmtions. directed to DartV Dlir
* w"" """ ? - I * I
oses, may control, while excessive
upidity may prevail in the other The
'ublic is thus constantly liable to impoition.
Expansions and contractions
iay follow each other in rapid succession
he one engendering a reckless spirit of
dventurc and speculation, which em braes
States as well as individuals; the
ther causing a fall in prices, and accomlishing
an entire change in the aspect
f affairs. Stocks of all kinds rapidly
ccline?individuals are ruined, and
itates embarrassed even in their efforts I
o meet with punctuality the interest on |
heir debts. Such, unhappily, is the
tate of things now existing in the Uni2d
States. These effects may readily
e'traced to the causes above referred to.
^he public revenues, on being removed
rom the then Bank of the United States
rider an order of a late President, were
laced in selected State hanks, which, j '
ctuated by the double motive of concilitinglhe
Government and augmenting I {
rieir profits to the greatest possible ex- j
?nt, enlarged extravagantly the?r dis- t
ounts, thus enabling all other existing i
anks to do the same. Large dividends i
'ere declared, which stimulating the cu- fl
ieity of capitalists, caused a rush to be f
lade to the Legislatures of the respec- r
!ve Slates for similar acts^ of incorpora- c
on, which, by many of the States under r
temporary infatuation, were readily 8
ranted, and thus the augmentation of s
ie circulating medium, consisting almost t
xclusively of paper produced a most fatal
elusion. An illustration, derived from a
ie land sales of the period alluded to, t
ill serve best to show the effect of the y
hole system. The averagtf sales of the h
uhlic lands for a period of ten years v
rior to 1834, had not much exceeded b
*2,000,000 per annum. In 1834 they n
I tained, in round numbers, to the amount
f $6,000,000. In the succeeding year, a
- - - - . VI
f 1835, they reached $16,000. And the r
ext year, of 1836, they amounted to the a
normous sum of 825,000,000. Thus 1
SI
rowding into the short space of three ^
ears upwards of twenty-three years'
urchase of the public dom>iin. So appa;nt
had become the necessity of arresting j
I
* 1
th.s course of things, that the Executive
Department assumed the highly question*
able power of discriminating in the funds
to be used in payment by different classes
of public debtors?a discrimination
which was doubtless designed to correct
this most ruinous stale of things by the
exaction of specie in all payments for the
public.lands, but which could not at once
arrest the tide which had so strongly set
in. Hence the demands, for specie became
unceasing, and corresponding prostration
rapidly ensued under the necessities
created with the banks to curtail
their discounts, and thereby to reduce
their circulation. I recur to these things
with no disposition to censure pre-existing
administrations of the Government,
but simply in exemplification of the truth
of the position which I have a&surped. If,
then, any fiscal agent which may be created
shall be placed, without due restrictions,
either in hands of the administrators
of the Government or those of private
individuals, the temptation to abuse
will prove to be resistless. Objects of political
aggrandizement may seduce the
first, and the promptings of a boundless
cupidity will assail the last. Aided by

pleasure of Congress so to guard and fortifv
the public interests, in the creation of
any new agent, as to place them, so far,
as human wisdom can accomplish it, on
a footing of perfect security. Within a
few years past three different schemes
have been before the country. The charter
of the Bank of the United States expired
by its own limitations in 1836. An
effort was made to renew it, which received
the sanction of the two Houses of
Congress, but the then President of the
United States exercised his veto power,
and the measure was defeated. A regard
to truth requires me to' say that the
President was fully sustained in the course
he had taken by. the popular voice. His
successor in the Chair of State unqualifiedly
pronounced his opposition to any
new charter ofa similar institution; and
not only the popular election-which j
brought him into power, but the elections
through much of his term, seemed clear,
ly to indicate a concurrence with him in
sentiment on the part of the People. After
the public moneys were withdrawn from
the United States Bank, tRcy were pla.
cod in deposite with Slate banks, and the
result of that policy has been before the
country. To say nothing as to the question
whether lhat experiment was made
under propitious or adverse circumstances
it may safely be asserted that it did receive
the unqualified condemnation of
most of its early advocates, and it is believed
was also condemned by the popular
sentiment. The existing sub-Treasury
system does not seem to stand in higher
favor with the People, but has recently
been condemned in a manner too plainly
indicated to admit of a doubt. Thas, in
the short period eight years, the popular j
voice may be regarded as having succes-1
lively condemned each of the three.
?? . t * i if
jchemesot nnance to wnicn i nave aaverted.
As to the first; it was introduced
it a time (1816) when the State banks;;
then comparatively few in number, had
3een forced to suspend specie payments
ly reason of the war which prevailed with
Great Britain. Whether if the United
States Bank charter which expired in
1811, had been renewed in due season, it
ivould have been enabled to continue *
jpecie payments during the war and the !
lisastrous period to the commerce of the '
;cuntry which immediately succeeded, is 1
:o say the least, problematical; and J
whether the United States Bank of 1816 j
jroduced a restoration of specie payments j
ir the same was accomplished through j
the instrumentality of other means, was
i matter of some difficulty at that time to
Ictennine. Certain it is that, for the
irst years of the operation of that Bank,
ts course was as disastrous as for the
jreater part of its subsequent career it!
>ecame eminently successful. As to j
he second, the experiment was tried ;
vith a redundant Treasury, which coninued
to increase until it seemed to be
he part of wisdom to distribute the Sur)lus
tevenue'among the States; which
>perating at the same time with the spe:ie
circular, and the causes before advered
to, caused them to suspend specie p?1ynents,
and involve the country in the
rreatest embarrassment. And, as to the
hird, if carried through all the stages of
he transmutation, from paper and specie
o nothing but the precious metals, to say
lothing of the insecurity of the public
uoneys, its injurious effects have been
mticipated by the country in its unqualiied
condemnation. What is now to be
egarded as the judgment of the Ameri:an
People on this whole subject, I have
io accurate means of determining but by
ippealing to their more immediate repreentatives.
The late contest, which ter
ninated in the election of Gen. Harrison
o the Presidency, was decided on princiiles
well known and openly declared}
nd, while the sub-Treasury received, in
he result, the most decided condemnation,
et no other scheme of finance seemed to
ave been concured in. To you, then
^ho have come more, directly from the
ody of our common constituents, I sublit
the entire question, as best qualified
ogive a full exposition of their wishes
nd opinions. I shall be ready to concur
nth you in the adoption of such a system
s you may propose, reserving to myself
he ultimate power of rejecting any mea re
which may, in mv view of it. conict
with the Constitution or otherwise
ropard the prosperity of the country ; a
ower which I could not part with even if
would, but which I will not believe any
act of yours will call into requisition#
I cannot avoid recurring, in connexion
with this subject, to the necessity winch 'M
exists for adopting some suitable measure
whereby the unlimited creation of baoka
by the States may be corrected in future.
Such arejsult can be moat readily'achier* 4
by the consent of the States, to be ex;
pressed in the form of a compact among'
themselves, which they can onjy enter
into with the ccnsent and approbation of
this Government; a consent which might*
in the present emergency of the public
demands, justifiably be given in adWtoce
of any action by the States as an induce*
ment to such action terms well defined
by the act of tender. Such a measure*
addressing itself to the calm reflection of
the States, would find in the experience
of the past and the condition of the present
much to sustain it. And it is greatly
to be doubted whether any scheme of
finance can prove for any length of time
successful while the States shall continue
in the unrestrained exercise of the power
of creating banking corporations. Tbia
power can only be limited by their Con

I With the adaption of a financial agen.
cy of a satisfactory cHhracter, thb bopa
may be indulged that the country may
once more return to a state of prosperity.
Measures auxiliary thereto, and, in some \ *
measures, inseparabl)\con nested with its
success, will doubtless claim the attention *
of Congress. Among such, a distribu.
tion of the proceeds of the- sales of the
public lands, provided 'such distribution
does, not force upon Congress the necessity
of imposing upon commerce heavier
burdens than those contemplated by the
act of 1833, would act as an efficient re*
medial measures bv being brought directly
in aid of the States, As one sincerely
devoted to the task of preserving a just
balance in our system of government, by j
the maintenance of the States in a con.
dition the most free and respectable, and
in the full possession of all their power,
'lean nootherwise than feel desirous for
their emancipation from the situation to
which the pressure on tbeir finances now
subjects them. And, while I must repu.
diate as a measure founded in error, and
wanting constitutional sanction, thesligh*
test approach to an assumption by this
Government of the debts of the States,
yet I can see, in the distribution adverted,
to, much to recommend it. The com.
pacts between the proprietor States and
this Government expressly guarantee to
the States all the benefits which may a.
rise from the sales. The mode by which
this is to be effected addresses itself to the
discretion of Congress as the trustee for
the Slates; and, its exercise, after the
most beneficial manner, is restrained by
nothing in thegrants or in the Constita.
tion so long as Congress shall commit that equality
in the distribution which the
compacts requite. In the present con*
dition of some of the States,' the question
of distribution may be regardeif as sub.
stantially a question betweert dirfect OHd ^
indirect taxation. If the distribution be
not, made in soine form or other, the necessity
^wiW* daily become more urgent
'with the debtor States for a resort to an
oppressive system of .direct taxatiob, or
their credit, and necessarily their power
elnd influence, will be greatly diminished.
The payment of taxes after the most in
convenient anu oppressive uioue win uv
exacted in place of contributions for the
most part voluntarily made, and therefore
comparatively unoppressive. The States
are emphatically the constituents of this
Government, a id we should be entirely re* sf
gardless of the objects held in view by
them in the creation of this Government '
if we could be indifferent to their good.
The happy effects of such a measure upon *
all the States would immediately be
manifested. With the debtor States it
would effect the relief, to a great extent,
of the citizens from a heavy burden of
direct taxation which presses with severity
on the laboring classes, and eminently
assist in restoring the general prosperity.
An immediate advance would take place
in the price of the. States securities, and
the altitude of the States would become
once more, as it should ever be, lofty and
erect. With States laboring under na
extreme pressure from debt, the fund
which they would derive from this source
would enable them to improve their con*
dition in an eminent degree. So far as
this Government is concerned, appropriations
to domestic objects, approaching in
amount the revenue derived from the land
ooloe mirrkf hn nhnnHnnAfL and tfinc a
system of unequal and' therefore unjust
legislation would bo substituted by one
dispensing equality to all the member* "
of this .Confederacy. Whether such dis- I
tribution should be made directly to the
States in the proceeds of the sales, or in
the form of profits by virtue of the openfr - "
tion of any fiscal agency having, those
proceeds as its basis, should such measures
be contemplated by Congress, would well
deservd its consideration. Nor would
such disposition of the proceeds of the
sales in any manner prevent Congress
from time to time from passing all necessary
pre-emption laws for the benefit
of actual settlers, or from making *ny
new arrangement as to the price of tbe
public lands which might in future be es?
teemed d sirable. <
