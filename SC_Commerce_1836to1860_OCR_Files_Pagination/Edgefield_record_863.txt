FomnIke Charleston Mercury.
Mr. Lailor.-' have been informed, to
my surprise,. that,' in consequience of a
short note; addi'essed to 'my fellow citizens
of the neighborihood in which I live. on
the 4th ofJuly last, I am supposed to be
in favor of resistance by the action of
South Carolina alone. Such an inpres
sion is entirely erroneous. I eipressed
a dozen'years since, the same sentiments,
almost in the same words, and n% a%, at the
same time, as is well knnn, decidedly
opposed to resistance by a single State.
Bat I shall now. with your permission,
leave do doubt of the position in which I
wish to stand. and, in doing so, I shall
mingle my opinion, and cnunsels with
those of my fellow-citizens, to be neighed
for what they are worth, in "this great ar
gument."
The Tariff I consider an act of insuffe
rable .and ~us:(h1ing oppression. % hich

my opinion, to be effective; must unite ithe
efforts of. at leagt, a large postion of the
suf'erers. I do not think one State ought
to resist alone. There will be neitheicon -
fidence nor certainty in such a course
The.people of one State, standing alone
would not be heartily united among them
selves. - It might he different if the Siae
were alone in the sufreriig; but sianding

more numerous- than fliernselves, whouse'
- arms were folded, the presence of these
would operate like i moral condemnnitation
of their act and chill the warm blinod.

But, it is asked. ifotir fellow sufferers'
will' not unite with us in resistance, shall
we basely submit? We have no righ: to
anticipate that' even. 'In my opition. if
they do not, .they will he insensible to

dare not cast this reproach upon them;
merely because they 'conot. thi-uk fit to

Already both are languishing unddr th.
intriguing power of mattufrcturing capi

South and South West, the grass wouldl
grow in the streets of your great Northern
ciiies. What cormpayatively, would Bos

more be, were the South and South West,
or evest the South alone,'obliged to retire
from the Union? What, if our intercourse
withi these cities were transferred to Liver
pmol and Havre? A inotnent's reflection
will be sufficie-it to show how little diffi
cult this transfer would be, especially
when we consider the present and grow

These and like ports are the ultimate
points of our present commerce, though
we are contented (gnied, easy people as we
are when not trample tn the earth by op.

great bond is now fearfully shattered and
almost severed by tariff and abolition com
binations, and %%ill soon altogether-perish
if -these combinations, be not resised.
Look at the great Democratic family of

in a spiritless paralytie movement, like
that of the halt and the lame; loik at the
great and good Old Dominion how it has
sunk and fallen, howt its glory has gone

is the cause of that general gloomy discon

ptersonal resentment for the great interests
A their country? You see Southern Sen

.Ives have repeatedly condemned and re

Iiit'aents, to a man, anxiously wished to
wequire -What is the cause of those
Joony clouds which lour in the poltical

snen suffer ofa fatal disruption of our noble
Institutions ? Dark as this picture may
be and certainly is, exclude but a single
group of the numerous Draiatis person&,
lt but the scene change so as to exclude
from the stage a few hundred overgrown
capitalists, the governors of power looms
and spinning jeunies, and a very small
number of reckless fanatic abilitionists,
and all will be lialit and life. We shall
immediately see the sky brighten and the
clouds disperse. We shall discover a free
porftable and increasing commerce, feed
ing and sustaining a prosperous agrit-ulture:
high prices for the produce of the soil, and
cheap supplies for its cultivators, with
union. harmony and fraternal love binding
together the whole people of the wiole
country. The good old Democracy tri
umphant and the moiely hand of Whig
ism--Here a bit of blackstone, and there
a bit of white"t-tiding its head in feeble
ness and defeat. The whole union flour
ishing, and the South loyal, contented
and happy. Texas bounding an-i strength -
ening our borders and increasing our wealth
and greatness. In the name of God, what
fatuity has come over !he people that they
do not discover the petty and odious ihral
dom in which ihey are bound and by which
the greatest boons and blessings cf Provi
deffce rthiaened with entire subversion
and even, in effect, turned -into curses.
But to return from this to long but inter
esting disgression in which we have looked
with a kind or prophetic vission. we think
on what we hope to see realized at no dis
tant day. When three or four States shall
arise with unblenching front, and uniite
heartily and resolutely. others will spedily
join them and onr relief will in all likeli
hood, be peaceably accomplished. and the
Union preserved. Yet let not this blessed
hope be relied upon with confidence, htt
anticipate a Worse result and be prepared
to meet it.
But we shall put at hazard that Union
which we so much love and honor, in
which we purchased a pat inership with
so many sacrifices, and he forced out of it
by that very people .against whom we
have heretofore defended it? It is, my
opinion, a lamentable truth, that, that
hazard must .be net and it is idle and
even dangerous to hesisate in avowina it
as the possible result. however much. we
may deprecate it.-There are worse evils
than disinion and we can hardly donbi that
we have been long suffering under them.
Bat, if the dissolution of the Union be a
great evil, and it certainly will be so to the
American people. and would be so tons,
if we were permitted to etijol its benefits,
the guilt and the reproach will rest 'upon
those who wantonly provoked it and those
who wantonly have suffered it to take
place. Yes wantonly, for the Historian
most record the fact, that the "sacrifice of
that glorious Inmstitut inn which might have.
secured, and perttetuated, to a distant pos
terity and greatness of twenty millions of
people, at this time, andl of more than an
hundred to no every remote fat urity, was
made to gratify the inoridinate avarice of
a few score (not more) of great capitalisms,
in asamll section of the country, and the
farious madnebs of a smaller number of
fanatical abolitionists, who comhinuiad to
gether to oppress the interests and to des
troy the peace. and happiness of the peo-.
ple of the Southern States, who, to their
honor of humanity resisted and overthrew
their wiclied designs."
Before Gtd, we dho not wish disnnion.
Let the Government hejttstly administered
and we will glory in the Union and give it
our whole hearts and .strength, in. Peace
and War, as we bave done before when
some of its most noisy eulogists, at the
present time. were not in ranks with us.
when they were almost in the ranks of a
foreign enemy. Btit whod has heretofore
spoken of disunion? Whettce did theiodi
ions term originate ? not surely from the
South.~ It came in the chill blast of the4
North and East. By what description of
persona has the idea..at any time, been put
forth at the . South? what men of note,
what great .public asusembly of the South
*has heretofore spoke of disunion. But
among those who have recently taken it
under ,tieir''peentliar . gu'ardianship the

This language may. bd4ew 'and strong,
but it is not the la' aEgeof violence.
There is a wide difference betreen ear-,
nestness and decisioatnd violence. The
last is folly and weaknesijthe first is the
sublimation of truth anid.sober reason. I
warn you' that anything short of what this
language intimates will be trifling with the
subject. Do not decieve yourselves by
supposing that the oly struggle, before
you, or the greatest is that' of the Tarifl.
That of Abolition. is at. hand (how near
we cannot distinctly see)and -of ten times
the importance and danger& The- Aboli
tionita aim directly at yourdestruction and
indirectly at the subversion; of: the Union.
That neither our destructiodn,'or the' mi
sery and dissolution of the Race they pre
tend to save, much less the preservation
of the Union, will restrain then in their
endeavors to establish their principles; is
but too clear. Their's is not - a. work',of
love but of hate. They hate youo.'hmore
than they love the African Race. But
what I mean to say is that they aim at:
-speedy and abolition, and to force it upon
you. Now, is there any sober man Q.f
common sense in the nation, who can be
lieve if they advance one step further but
that the Union must be dissolved. They
cannot advance one step further without
entering your territories and controlling
your laws. This I think will appedr-by
s,tating the advances they have already
made. They have not indeed actually
exchanged credentials and entered into a
Treaty in diplomatic form. with Foreign
nations, but they are most directly co-oje
rating with Foreign associations and, at
least, one great Foreign Govereniment,
all pledged to universal emancipation.
The proofs are among others 1st. -The
exisiance of abolition Societies of great
weight and numbers in Great Britain.
2nd. Theco-operation of the gnvernment of
Great Britain with their own Societies. 3d.
The co-operation of our abolitionists with
those foreign Societies. 4th. That these Fo
reign Societies have theiragents,andorators
with whori they cotrespond, on the floor
of Congress. 5th. Thai they have a polit
ical party in iany States, organised aid
distinetly designated. 6th. That this par
ty forms one great element of the great
Whig party of the Union-ai least in pow
er ir not in name, so much so that if the
Whig candidate for the Presidency be sue
cessfil he will owe his success to abolition
votes, because in some States whose votes
are necessary to his success, New York,
for example, the Whigs. without the votes
of the ab-,litionists will be in the minority.
Tiese Foreign Societies will thus, if that
result happen, have had great iifinence in
the election of uur Chief Magisti-ate. 7th.
Great Britain has already iuierp6sed with
our own government in a manner to cnn
tenance the American Abolitionists, by
declaring its views to be in coincidence
with theirs, and which onr Executive
Government has verv properly protested
against. 8th. There is the hostile act oh
the Legislature of the State of Massachu
seuas, which in itself wrould, if executed,
be a subversion of the Union. 9th. The
temper of abolitionists. evincive of- the
consciousness of their power, of which I
shall give but one-proof. That-is a letter
of' - te Anacharsis Clools, of the United
States. In this letter after abusing, in the
gra.ssestiterms, the P'resident of theoUnited
States, the present Secretary of State and
several'-of his predecessors, and denouncing
generally the conduct of the Government
of his own country, and showving-himse~lf
in heart and soul devoted to the unfriendly
views of a roroign country, be comes down
to the late letter of remonstrasnce oI Mr.
Calhoun to the British Minister and says,
-'we are yet to learn with what ears the
sound of the trumpet of slavery was list
ened to by. the British Queen and her min
isers.-We are yet to learn, whether the'
successor of Eliznbeth on the throne of
England, and her Burleighs and Walsing

pose to p'romote umiversal emauncipation,'and
the extinction of slavery, is to be met by the

mina'ing war; will hike craven roweards,
torn - their backs and jiee, or eat their owon
words, or disclaim the purpose and object
whdi they' hace avowed."~ [ now ask if
the abolitionists can go one step further
without entering your territories and con
trolling your laws? Whether they do not
not shake 'he union, and whether if they

In fine, it is my humble opinion..thatif.
we are to resist at all, ve must surrendei
this trembling fear of the dangers ofthe
union to other rears and dangers ;much
more important, involving. ;nterests still
dearer to us, & which immediately come:

ndeffectual resistance will be made with

That therefore, the great object of exertion
-is to effect that concurrence; and that as
ofieb as you shall attempt separate action
you will fail, and more and mo.re weaken.

theie are some incidental matte'rS on
which I propose to dwell for -a short time.
There is one measure freqently recoriu
mended, which I think- decidedly'wrong,
and therefore dangerous. I mean the call
of a State Convention. I think it wrong
for the following reasons, among many
others.
Ist, this is proved in the very outset
by the fact that moray. perhaps all propose
it under the supposition, that a- Conven
ton possessed some power applicaple to
the question, which the Legislature does
not possess, which is a gross mistake.
The Legislature possesses all the power of
ihe Sovereign People except .where it is
eispresly restraitied by the Constitution...
Now there is no restraibt upon it .in the. -
Constittion. which hears on any measure,.
that has been or can be imagined for the
redress of our grievances.
2d. The value. efliciency and- power ot
Government is mainly founded in stabilit
uniformity and ever, the established- fornis
with tvhicb its powers - are executed. A t,
presents a well known legal person to-die
people of the State and to the whole world,
acting under just arespionibilit and with
the greatest wisdoin'ihe euttry can sup.
ply, if the Representatives he properly

for one of great skill andi -apropriaten1es,
insituted by the wisest men tn -the State,
with great deliberation, the' absence 4t
all e xcit ement, for-the express purpioss
all the powers granted to it-by the Consti
tution. A Convention cannot be- called,
under the Constitution, orf -tis State ft

will do no harm. - They examsple of con
vening it, is-itself an evil. -- Thouah'. ther
be now no danger of the abuse of it. it may
hereafter -become a terriblie instrument-.
in the hands of a faction -or a demagogue.
4th. The action of the State, whatever ai
may be. must immediately or ultimntely,
look to the co-operation of.-other -States,
and for the reasons I have mentioned and
others, it may have a forbidding aspect
in the eyes of those.States. --If' this State
shall only act jointly with other.States,
that action will probably be more harmo
nious and homogeneous if we einploy the ---
same authorities which they, in all likelia
hood, will employ.
