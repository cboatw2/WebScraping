used by the new light p. } ieriesas an auxiliary
to tlr ir ultrior scheme of prostrating
our Standards by their vain philosophy and
jesuitical running. On this subject I would :

Viol ytiox of the right of Property.?
.1 citizen of Wilmington. N. C. lately carried
a slave with him as servant to Boston. As he
ought to have known would be the case, the
slave was taken from him by the abolitionists,
and, according to a recent judicial decision in
that State, he had no remedy. We are very
far from intending to palliate such violation
of justice, under color of law; hut at the same
time, the master deserved this punishment?it
was light enough?too light?for carrying a
slave among the abolitionists, intending to bring
it hack again to reside among other shies at
O O

The unparallcd distress in the commercial
community and the unquestionable agency of
the "succie circular*' in Droducino- it and knnn
ing it up, it was hoped would induce the Presidentto
revoke this circular, and thuSilo something
towards mitigating tiie evil; but recent
editorials in the Washington Globe, supposed
to speak the sentiments of the Administration,
have removed all grounds for such hope. The
ridiculous and childish project of making gold
the common currency of the country still haunts
the imagination of those who hold the reins of
government. The following is the conclusion
of one of the articles in the Globe.
President Jackson is gone, but the author of
the letter to Sherrod Williams is in the Pres
idential scat; anil the specie policy is still th(?
order of the day. The Public will recollect
that letter, and with how much emphasis it
rested upon the increase of the gold and silver
circulation, the suppression of notes under
twenty dollars, and the coinage at the three
branch mints. We venture to predict that
specie will go on increasing at the rate of several
millions per annum during the whole of
Mr. Van Buroifs administration, and that gold
ivill be a common currency before his time is
mt.
The three branch mints will goto work this
summer, and Congress lias put it fully in the
power of the administration to keep them at
work. By an act of the last session of Congress,
the sum of one million of dollars may be
kept at the mint to supply it with metal; and
by an act of the previous session, an unlimited
amount may be transferred to the mint and its
branches for the same purpose. Thus, the
supply of metal will be ample, lor it will be unlimited;
and the public may rest assured that
lie successor to President Jackson, the author
>f the letter to Sherrod Williams, will not suf:cr
the mint and its branches to stand idle for
.vant of material to work up.
Editorial Conventions.?A Convention
)f Editors was lately held in Kentucky, who

raternity; a similar Convention is soon to be
icicJ in Nashville (Tenn.) among the rules
idoptcd by the Kentucky Convention was
he following :
4th. That every proprietor of a newspaper
vithin the State engages to refuse einpJoynent
to any apprentice, (whether indentured
?r not,) who fails to comply with his engagenents
to his master, although he may have
.rrived at the age of twenty-one years.
This rule will, no doubt, soon become gencal
among editors and publishers. Another
food rule would be to refuse employment to
l Journeyman, who, at any time, leaves an
mployer in violation of his engagements.
