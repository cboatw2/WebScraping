- In my last I gave some rovs on tho ro

tatson ot crops in unw Dream,?;i ju uci.
ous mode of culture, which is now adopted
* to a considerable extent in Sweedcn* Denmark,
and the grain growing countries in
the North of Europe. Thus, dx; soil, although
it does not anuoally give the same
kind of product to the cuititaior, is never
idle, but produces in succession of crops
which are often more valuable than wbca.
itself.
As however wheat is not only one of the,
staple articles of Europe, hut also of our own*
country. I propose o devote this arti le to n
description ol the method of culture.
1st. Preparation of the Soil. The
whoa; crop as I hare stated in a former
chapter, usually succeeds the follow crop,
which consis.ed of pnta'o*s, beans, or tur
nips. This fullotfr crop is always richly manured.
Stable manure is in a majori V ol
instances used, and in most soils is preferred.
It is spread on the ft-- ds broad cos: in
the proportion of i w. nty or twenty five tons
to the aere. In about half the cases it is
scattered over the fi -Ids in the i r\rly part of
wmter, and ploughed under in December.
Where time is wanting the manure is not
app'i< d till early in the spring, which, I am
informed, nnsw< rs equally well. Lime is
much used ?n light sandy soils. In some
parts of the coast of Hull uid, where the soil
is poor and sandy, the application of lime
has given a dark, rich colour, to the earth,
which now retains its moisture and produces
abundant crops. On the sandy lands b?*.
tween Berlin and Dresden, rcs'-mbling our
Carolina pine barrens, I noticed, jr us#?d in
some fields with very beneficial efforts.
Sim liar r suits have been pro luced in NewJersey
by the application of lime on bare
sandy soil. Bone dust is much used in
England on light soils. It is generally procured
from the continent. A few mills for
the pur. ose of grinding the bone for manure
exist in England and Scotland, although
they did no: fall under m v notice. A model
of one exists in ihe agricultural museum of
Edinburgh, which was politely exhibited to
nr by Professor Lowe. Toe construction
is very simple : but as I believe i is well un
derstood in the United Slat s, and as I ain
not much of a mechanic, I need not venture
on a description. Toe b ne dust is used m
the proportion of twenty five bushels 'O the
acre ; a greater quantity has not been attended
with any increased beneficial n-su'ts It
is sown broad cast on the land ; sometimes
mix-d with turnip seed. Night soils, a
(very valuable manure,) are limited to the
neighborhoods of towns, a d principally up.
plied to g'rdens. .This "article is prepared
in the vicinity of Paris by a method rendering
ti not in the least offensive. It has lbappearance
of large, dried tricks, which unbroken
up when wanted, and applied to the
laid in the manner of bone dusr.
When the fallow crop has been removed,
the ground is plough d and put in order lor
the reception of wheat: occasionally some
manure is added, but it is in general believed
that the ground is sufficiently enriched for
the en -uing crop. The ploughing is similar
to that of our own country. The wheat is
sown from the middle ;o the end of October,
generally in drills, but sometimes broad
cast. The sowing or drilling of the wheat
does not coniple.e the labour till the time
of harvest, as as is the case in America.
The wheat is regularly hoed between the
drills two or three times, and when the
wheat is about a foot in height, it is carefully
weeded,?hence, we seldom find in
English wheat either cockle, chenr, or the
i r . % . . . ...
Bccas 01 me various weeds with which our
fields are so often infested. Tlie wheat is
usually gathered with the sickle, i saw
no cradles, like those of America, in use.
2ndv Quantity of seed to the Acre.
In this particular I found a great difference
of opln.on between th< British and American
farmer. In this country a bushel of
wheat is usually considered sufficient for an
acre; formerly many persons only used
three pecks per acre. I am inclined to
think, that we have erred in using too liitle
seed. I remember visiting the fields ol u
farmer in New York many years ogo, arid
observed that whilst the heads of whoat
were very fine, the stalks appeared :o stand
very thinly on the ground. He had sown
three pecks to lite acre, and the produce
was nine bushels. I suggested to him the
I .V D CI

propriety of using a double qoanti'y o
seed. Three years aferwards be sowiv
th" same Geld again, using a bushel and ?
half of seed to the aero,?:;he season one
tillage were similar to that of the fonnei
sowing. He subsequcnt'y informed rm
that' his land this year produced fiheer
bushels to the acre, and that he was now
an advoca'e for thick sowing.
I extract from my notes on English hus.
bandry the followhig quotat'on, which 1
ehher wrote down from the dictation ol
some responsible agriculturist, or copied
from some agricultural journal of England;
I am inclined to think the lafter. I have
reason to believe it is the usual mode ud<>p
ted in England and Seoland.
"On rich lands in good condition when
th- soil is strong loam or clay, and well
drained, two anaa half tod wo nnd thm^
qunr cr-bushels per imperial acre may be
sufficient, of the ordinary varieties. As
spring sown wheat does not tiller well, one
half io three quarters < fa bushel more may
be necessary; but strong clays are not well
a bipted to spring sown wheat, although it is
quite possible that a suitable variety; m?\
be obtained foi that purpose.
" On med'um sods one half bushel more
may he requisite for such season ol sowing,
regulating the qua itity to the quali y and
condition of the soil, and the preceding crops.
When potatoes have been raised in the laL
low division, at least two or three pecks
more may be necessary than aft-r u chain
la low.
44 0;i high nod light lands, wheat, after
fallow, should bo drilled ;n from two to three
inches deep, to pr- vent throwing out in
spring. VV 'ii th.s precaution, ift' c land is
in g"od co-.d ion. I.tile more so d will ho
want' d than on medium ; but on such lands
when? holds bes after grass, and in tlia c ise
requires two or 'liree pecks more seed than
under any o'her circ ims nniv."
A? I have never seen the snlks of wheat
so thieklv crowded together in rriv own
country as in Great Brh.ain, ar;d as their avemge
crop i decidedly greater h in ours I
have ascribed the difference, at least
iri some measure, to ihe greater quantity oi
m> ed usee by the buroprun agruulturKK
alter making due .lioiv.tnees fur the diffr
ence of clunme nn l modes of cuhure, I remarked,
that in Kngland, tu consequence
of this th ok sowing, Metro was lint one stalk
to each gram, whilst in America, uh< re the
seeds were I'.ir:! er separated, (hen* arc'us i

3rd Varieties of Wheat in Eerope.
Boiamss have l?< en much perpl> x< d in ? ?d
avoring to deride on the tru" origin
gin of our varevies wlieat. It is now dilfi *
c.ilt to asecrain what is tlie true triticum
sativutn or common wheat, lit general tin
bearded and b? nf lless wheats are divided
in two species. The former are termed
trilicum htjbernum, or win-er wheat, and the
latter triticum ashcum, or sumnrv r wheat. I
am, however, incl n? d to th nk, that all the
vorietiiw may be included under one species,
as there are no distinctive marks by w ucli
hey can be separated. Under triticum hybcrnutn,{>*r
ins:anee, ar in lu led s veial of
ttie earlier and best varieties of spring
wheat, and under triticum (Bat,turn are ineluded
several, he rded wliea s eq allv
hard), and requiring as long lime to arrive
at maturity as our common winter suits
Indeed, the recent Fr 'iich boianis s have
now referred all the varieties to triticum
sativum. But this is not the place to settle
nee botanical dis mctio is.
Spring wheat is seldom cultivated in
England as a general crop. In every instance
whcie I saw it growing, it appeared
to tnt rather inferior.
In my last number I alluded to some of
the varieties of wheat at present cultivated
in England. The go'den drop, blood red,
Uxbridge, Hunters, Mengosuells, Whittington
& Hicklmgs. Tlio three latter, like
our okra cotton arid rohau pota'oe, have
been so n ceii ly introduced that they have
no' yei found their way in o general cultivation.
The specimens, howev r, which I
saw were very sup?*rior, sufficiently so to
encourage tae American firmer to import
the 8* ed. which may be ord red from Lawson
and Sons, Edit.burg, or Loddige ill London,
or through anv merchant at Liverpool.
An order sent in July will be in sufficient
time to enable the farmer to plunt the seed
in au'umn.
The wheat called Leghorn, or Tuscany
wheat, was introduced into England for the
purpose of procuring straw for the manufacture
of bonnets, &c.; but it was found not to
succeed as well as the common rye, which
is now exclusively cultivated in the Orkney
islands, and the north of Sco.lund for thai
purpose.
In the northern parts of France. 1 saw cultivated
pretty extensively, 11 very hardy variety
of wheat called Poulard, bleu, and
bleu coniquc. I. is partial to rich clay soils ;
its grains are dark and very hard. An Egyptian
wheat called life de Smyrna was'ulsc
highly spoken of. Tner?'s a variety o!
wheat biought origin .lly uoin Morocco thai
is successfully cultivated in Italy, but does
succeed well in the northern parts of Europe
that might be experimented on in our south
em States. Its spikes are long, loose, nodding

Hut the cultivation of grasses is hot alone
<ss'ntial jn affording pasturage and hay,
and thereby adding to the comforts of .life
in providing us with milk, butter, and meats,
for out tables ;vjhoy are very important
' aids in restoring exhausted soils. They are
substi utes for manure. Our plantations in
the south arc so large that with oil our industry
in collecting leaves, and stable manure,
not one half of our fields are-ever manured.
Hence, our lands in time become
exhausted, are thrown out as old fields, and
not cultivated again for many years. Some
-ofpur Planters remove to the VVpst^ believing
it cheaper to clear new groundaJnan to
res ore cxhnusted ones. In the mean time
they and their families have to undergo
many hardships and privations. They are
thrown among strangers, severed from the
associations of earlv life, and are deprived
of ihe advantages of society,?of schools
and churches. Had the same labour been
bestowed in renovating their now deserted
plantations, that has been used in seLling
iheir new farms, they would probably have
suffered nothing in fortune and gained much
in comfort.
That lands may be improved in cultivalion
without adding stable manure, has been
shown by many successful experiments. I
h >ve seen lands in Pennsylvania and NewYork
which are now more productive than
tiiey were twenty years ago, and'have been
continually improving although under cultivation,
without the addition of any other
manure than the small quantities of Plaster
of P uis in which the wheat had been rolled
previous to sowing. The w heat was succeeded
by a crop of clover: this produced
one or two plentiful crops of hay the first
yar, and was probably pastured the year
following. Crops of Indian corn, or pota.
toes, buckwheat, oats, wheat, and clover,
sue eeded each other ; the farmer became
every year more comfortable in his circumstances.
and felt no desire to leave his kinkindred
and native home in search of an Eldorado
in the West.
In mv next 1 will endeavour to cnumerate
some ol the foreign brasses that micht
he cultivated in our southern country with
u probability of success.
TREATMENT OF BROKEN LIMBS OF HORSES.
To the Editor of the Franklin Farmer : ?
Dear Sir?Being a great lover of stock,
and deriving more pleasure hy contributing
to diat part of animated nature that cannot
make its wants known to man, than from
any oth< r source, and learning through your
paper that Medoc has met with a misfortune
that may prove fatal, I have thought fit to
g;ve you the result of my experience in a
parallel case that occurred to a Jurk lust
spring. I feel much hesitation in doing
this, being well apprized that Medoc is in
the neighborhood of as good surgical, aid as

for suggesting his opinions, even to
the s ?ge?but to my case. The left fore
aun was fractured transversely, about five
inches above the knee joint, the bone betwixt
this fracture an I the knee, was split down to
the joint, so that, in reality there were two
fractures, communicating with each other.
The first thing done, was to suspend him,
for the reason that it had been the practice
heretofore ; but close attention soon satistied
me that my nnimul was very uncom.
tortable and restless. Although 1 knew the
fr ctured par s could be kept better fitted to
each other, by keeping him suspended,
than they could be, if he were permitted to
touch thegrouid; I determined to make
the experiment for the following reasons:
The piessure upon his lungs affected his
breathing very much, and upon his bowels
produced great costiveness. However,
affr turning him loose, I soon found the
limb swinging about, whenever ho moved.

and quite crooked when ho touched the
ground. It immediately occurred to me,
thai some; hi ng moro than ordinary bandages
must be applied. I made a bandage of
s'tong cotton domestic, about two inches

to the body, and back to the ancle joint?
spread it from end to end with thick tar?

would lap hull The wiJth upon the previous

cotton nicely carded and laid betwixt two

kne" jdtot to the elbow, so as to encompass
the whole of the fractured limb?quilted
carefully?-running the rows of siiches
about an inch from each other, for the purpose
of keeping the cotton permanent 5
ihis was also spread with tar.and laid over
the. first bandage. I then made some wdiite

enough to extend from the knee to the

domestic, wido enough to go round the
wno!? of the previous dressing; this was
likewise spread with tar and laid on, am
the whole secured with strong tape, sewer

j tinged for eight weeks, without iHng touch

receded, and my patient recovered with verj

I be certain to examine and sco that tl?<

Value of Maret and, Horses, <ti
Draft Animals.
! Mr. Editor? It is a fact QM generally

* "" - ? 5*VM% ence
in the valuu of horses arid mares,
as draft animals* If a mare has once been
* spoilt by awkward driving,~by being balk,
ed or frequently smiled,?she is never, or
very rarely, cured of her bad haiits,?she
can never, ng&in be relied on for a steady
draft, either for the wagon or plough, so per.
verse are they hi their natures ! la the
management of teams for some twenty or
twenty-five years, I hare nevbr known of
more than one instance of a mare's being
spoilt, and-afterwards reclaimed, and even
that instance could not be cited as a steady
nag. The most careful and skillful man.
agement will have htiie or no effect. But it
is not so with the horse. I do not re mem be f
to have seen a single instance where the
male of that species of which we nre treat,
ting, has been judiciously roeneged, after be.
ing ever so badly spoilt, but thut he was re.
claimed, and where almost as much reliance
was not to be placed in him, as when he wan
first hitched. My experience would go fully
to establish the fact in my own mmd, had I
not tho experience of others. Being a
staunch advocate of domestic manufactures,

are rendered useless for the collar, by their
being balked or stn lied, dtad fed mc to abatr*

to prefer, (at least in a measure.) getting
them from abroad. There are exceptions
to this, as to every general rule?Where the
mare is good tempered, docile and easy (D
manage, I believe them to be superior te the
horse, for all purposes?Hence f would
advise every one in purchasing horses, to
select, (if he buy a mnro.) only such as"*
