TFIE Establishment of the COMMERCIAL
COURIER was rendered necessary by the incon- i
venience to which our citizens have been subjected !
for the want of a public channel of communication 1
which in a commercial community like Camden, is j
essentially necessary, and consequently the COU- I
R1ER S claim on the public is such as should en- j
sure a liberal patronage.
The undersigned have spared no trouble or ex- j
pense in obtaining the best workmen in order to (
render the Paper ?ll the advantages that it will i
admit of, and affording satisfaction to its patrons. |
In political matters the Courier will take no i
part; the design being to publish a Paper adapted !
to the interest ok all, which could not he effected j
by its entering into the arena of Politics?it will j
oe connnea principally to such matter as appertains
to Commerce, Agriculture and Amusement.
The COURIER is published every Saturday
morning at Three Dollars in advance, or Four
Dollars if not paid until the expiration of the year. !

THE succcHsof the SOUTHERN TONIC is
unprecedented. It has been anxiously sought ,
after by all persons in every part of the United
Stntes, and its widely extended distribution has (
been owing to the many requests received from
every section of the South and South West. Although
it originated in an obscure p.irt of the coun- J
try hut a few years since, it is now found in all the
principal towns and villages in the Union, and its
virtues as a cure for Ague and Fever, and as a
general Tonic, are appreciated by all who have I
used it. Being- ns it professes a compound of
Southern Vegetables, it is needless to ofler the assurance
that there is no Arsenic, Mercury, nor nny t
tiling in the least hurtful to the human constitu- J
tion in it. It will be found a valuable Medicine j
in all cases of Dyspepsia and disorganised Stomach
and Bowels, and patients convalescing from Billious
Fever, \v'... derive the most important bene- r
ills from the use of the Southern Tonic. It may
be administered to children and infants of the most
tender age with the utmost safety. Prepared by
Coster and Coxe at their Labratory, at Montgomery

PITEXT COTTON r,l\.
S\H1S Gin can be made double, or single. If,
made double, they reduce labor, and gin just j
ouble, the quantity of cotton over the single cylin- i
er Gin, no other knd having been in use prcvous :
> this patent; and whether single or double, they '
re found to improve the quality of the cotton, by j
lore perfectly cleaning it. They con be made to
ontain from 20 to ICO saws in a stand, and whether
mall or large, one hand will be sufficient to attend |
liein. The Gins have mechanical feeders and
toppers attached to thein, which free the cotton
roin leaves, trash, dirt, &C. before it can reach the
aws, and b_v the thorough hackling operation it
cceives lroin the feeders, which make two revontions
to one of the ?:nv< if iv - i?ir
? - - ... ukiki in u nan
ined state, before it descends to tlie saw By a
pry simple arrangement of a screw to erich set of
aates, on which tlie hoppers rest, and through
rhicb the teetli of the feeders pass, they can he
aade to feed slow or fast to suit the condition of
he cotton at the time. When made double, the ,
aws are placed on two sets of cylinders and turn !
pon each other in opposite directions, and are '
leansed by two sets of brushes that have four revo- i
utions to one of two saw. The two cylinders can
e detached 30 as to enable the planter to run one 1
r both at pleasure, although embraced with feeders, |
ic. in one stand. The whole is put in operation '
>*ith a drum and band, as in the ordinary Gin, and '
lay be propelled by horse, steam, or water power. .
t may also be propelled by iron running gear. I
'ho force required to work it, is about the same as i
hat necessary to move an equal number of saws in
lie common Gin. This Gin lias been put in
peration in New Orleans for two or three weeks,
nd its success tested in the presence of a large
umber of planters, merchants and others, and
pceived their general approbation
Several gentlemen have been so kind as to give
he Patentee their written opinion lespecting the
rierits of the Gin. A number of others could be

'Dr. A. Jones?Dear Sir, in reply to your note,
accompanied by a specimen of the cotton, ginned

exhibits a decidi d improvement on the usual process
of ginning ; delivering the staple uninjured
and iree from Hap or trnsh, clean and of good color
; thereby giving the article an additional value.
These favorable impressions of the advantages of
your Putent Gin, huve been confirmed by subsequently
witnessing it in operation. The utility of
the double cj linders and saving of labor, will be
readily perceived and properly appreciated by the

From Mr. G. Senior, u Machinist of New Orleans.
Dr. A. Jo< es?Dear Sir, in answer tc your inquiry
of my opinion of your Patent Cotton Gin, I
b?g leave to slate, that I was fifteen years engaged
in the cotton factories of Manchester, England,
and during four years of that time, 1 was
foreman in the house of Messrs. Lewis, Williams
Ar Co., and near five years spinner in the house of
Messrs. Fnndford & Gn'ene. I have seen your
Cotton Gin in operation, and have examined the
cotton ginned by it, and pronounce it better cleansed,
and the staple less injured, than any cotton
that ever came'under my observation. It is completely
ready for the breaker without the aid of the
blower, and would, therefore, save the first process
in manufacturing the article. 1 consider cotton
cleansed by your Gin, would command from one
to two cents on the pound more than the average
crops brought into the Manchester market, and
cleansed by common Gins. Yours, very resp'ly.
N. Orleans, March 9, GEORGE SENIOR.
Dr. Jones?Dear Sir, in answer to your inquiry
respecting my opinion of your Patent Cotton Gin,
J have to state, that I have been engaged in putting
up the Carver Gins for planters on lted River,
and that I have seen your Gin in operation, and
have examined the quality of the cotton produced
by it; I consider it equal if not superior to the Carver
Gins: in addition to which, 1 think your feeders
a decided improvement, and by the aid of
which, the quality of the cotton cleansed appeatc
much improved, over that produced by the common
Gins. Yours &c. JS. BENNETT.

The Gins oidered will be delivered to the agents
of planters in any of the sea port towns of the cot.
ton planting States, at the above prices, the agentu
paying the freight on the same from Nrw York,
and becoming responsible for !he amount of the Gin.
It is desirable, when planters give orders for Gins,
they should accompany tlx in with thoir views in
regard to the arrangement of saws, breasts, brushes,
&c. It is found they difler in opinion. Some
desire saws of larger diameter than others. The
uiuui. common size is :> or jl) inches; but some wish
them 12 inches, 8ome wish 5 or 6 rows of brushes
on 'in axle, while others do not want more than 4
at most. Some wish saws with 8 or 0 teeth to the
inch, while others want 10 or 11. With so much
discrepancy, we prefer they should, at the time of
giving orders, furnish a statement of their wishes,
and the maiiufacturerers can fulfil them in every
particular. Where it is lelt to our discretion, we
shall make them on the most modern and approved
plan. An order can be executed, from the time it
is received, in the space of eight or nine weeks,
and the Gin in that time placed in the hands of the
factor. To be in time for the next crop, all orders
ought to be in the hands of the manufacturers by
the first or middle of May ; except for plantations
where they are late in commencing to pick or gin
cotton.
N. B.?The Patent Right, for any one of the
cotton growing States, will be sold on reasonable
terms. May 0 I ti
