svramp Mud.?Were the farmers to pay ]
more attention to draining their low lands
they would find it much to their interest.
Separate from the advantages of render- ,
ing their low lands dry and productive,
much manure of the first quality miglu he
taken from the ditches, and when spread
upon fallows aud other uplands under til- "
lage, wbuld repay all the expense of ditching*
Many seem to entertain the idea,
that nothing is worth carting or spreading ,
n? mtkmirrv mtloac it hnc hoen I nr> t Oil
in the barn yard, or is the excrcmeilt of
animals.
All vegetable matter undergoing decomposition
furnishes food for growing plants ,
and may be applied as manures. In short
any thing, whether vegetable or -animal |
substance, which on being mixed with a
soil under cultivation, and which increases
the growth of plants cultivated in such
soil, is termed manure. Different soils
require different substances to be applied, I
in order to facilitate the growth of plants;
thus, light and sandy soils, which are too
loose to retain moisture, are greatly benefitted
by the application of clay; and
such earths as are comparatively too retcnlive
of moisture* are greatly altered
ed tor the better, by mixing with the n a
portion of snud* so that whatever be the
soil which requires ditching, the earth removed
may be carted to a different soil,
and be applied as a manure. There is on j
some farms .small swamps or depressions,
in which vegetable matter collects, and
which cannot without considerable expense
be drained ; these frequently become
<1 ry during summer, when large
quantities of manure might be taken out
of them. Good farmers will look carefully
to these things ; but some that are
new in the profession, may not be aware
of the importance of such dqposites, and
a hint from us may not be considered |
amiss.
Pruning Trees.?"-We notice, that some
of our neighbors have already commenced
pruning their fruit and shade trees.?
The operation had belter be omitted, until
ibe month ??f May. or even the fore
part <if June, as the wounds made bv cmting
off limbs at that season, will sooner
be covered with new wood, then those
made by cutting during the winter. The
probing of fruit trees inav he omitted. un-J
til they have passed the flower, and the '
young fruit begins to show itself, the
limbs to be cut away can be more judiciously
selected, with regard to the crop.
Ornamental trees may be trimmed, as;
soon as they begin to leaf out. In cutting j
ofl' a limb, a small cut should always be t
made on the lower side first, then the
limb may be sawed or cut on the upper
aide, without the danger of splitting down
when nearly off, which often happens,
when this precaution is not taken.

laborers than Oxen.?An English wri-1
ter observes, " 1 think cows arc much '
more useful and beneficial than oxen, and \
that it would be an advantage to the king I
<lom, if few or no oxen were reared. The I
uses cattle arc to work, milk and feed. 1 i
have seen barren cows, work as well us!
oxen ; they require less keep and icalkjaster.
Oxen are of no use in the dairy, and they
will not feed (fatten) as last as cows.
When first I commenced farmer, I followed
the example of my predecessor in
feeding chiefly oxen ; but 1 soon found,
that cows led rtuch faster and on less!"
Went; and. for some years past, have 1
caretully avoided having any oxen in my '

Extract of a letter?from the Spirit of the Times.
Butesville, (Ark.) May 1.
Dear P.?I have just returned from
Van Buren County ; had the exquisite
pleasure of seeing your correspondent,,
*' Pete Whetstone." He says you ought ,
not to call him Peter?but Pete. Settle j
this, or you will raise his dander ; Pete is 1
a jewel in his way. He made all sorts of
a speech to the sovereigns while I was ;
over. The commencement wus much I
after this fashion :
44 We, the people of Van Burcn, are
shut out fiom the candle of light by the
cloud capp'd hills that surround us; tho'
we drink of the purling streams that llow
at their foot?though we were sown in
the whirlwind, and reap'd in the storm,
yet, fellow citizens, we are the true democracy
of tne land. [Near him, hear him.]!
Who is this Marling Van [luring, who i
comes from the State of York, riding on1
~ i
the suburbs of prosperity in the open at- j
inosphere? [Go it, my Pete.] 1 ask him
no boot; and if he does not let lis have l
land for paper money, we will make him
smell hell! [Hurrah, Pete.] You have!
known me from the time 1 killed the wild
cat on Devil's Fork until now ; you know ;
1 am real i?rit?well- I nr?-.?r ??
, _ onj |>iiuiiciy j
ami above board, that when the lark rises!
011 his rectum, and soars aloft, before the
sun has dried the dew on his feathers, 1
generally make him ding up his tail, A
wink is as good as a nod to a blind man;
so look out, Marling Van Buring. [Ilur-j
rah for Pete.] It is my treat, boys, so i
come up."
This is all I can recollect of Pete's
speech , he is good for the Legislature.
Yours truly, T. ,

been ow.ing to the many requests received from
every section of the South and South West. Although
t. originated in an obscure p rl of the country
but a few years since, it is now found in all the
principal towns and villages in the Union, and its i
: virtues as a cure for Ague and Fever, and as a
general Tonic, are appreciated by all who have j
uwu 11. i>eing as ii proteases a compound of
Southern Vegetables, it is needless to oiler the assurance
that there is no , rsenic, Mercury, nor any

double, the quantity of cotton over the single cylin- -j
Jer Gin, no other knd having been in use previous |
o this patent; and whether single or double, thoy j
rro found to improve the quality of the cotton, by ?.
,nore perfectly cleaning it. 'l'liey can be made to
contain from lit) to 100 saws in a stand, and whether
small or large, one hand will tie sufficient to attend
Ihein. The Gins have mechanical feeders and | i
hoppers attaehed to tliein, which free the cotton
troin leaves, trash, dirt, before it can reacli the
saws, and by the thorough hackling operation it
receives from the feeders, which make two revolutions
to one of the saws, it is almost in a halt ' 1
aiiied state, before it descends to the saw By a
very simple arrangement of a screw to each set of
jantes, on which the hoppers rest, and through
which the teeth of the feeders pass, they can be F
made to feed slow or fast to suit the condition of
the cotton at the time. When made double, the
jaws are placed on two Bets of cylinders and turn 1upon
each other in opposite directions, and are
ileansed by two sets o! brushes that have four revo- f
lilt ions to one of two saw. The two cylinders can
IP detached so as to enable the planter to run one
ir both at pleasure, alt liouirh embraced with feeders. ' F
Jtc. in one stand The whole is put in operation j
with a d uui and hand, as in the ordinary Gin. and i
nay he propelled by horse, steam, or water power. I F
It may also be propelled by iron running gear. j
The force required to work it, is about the same as F
hat necessary to move an equal number of saws in 1
he common Gin. This Gin has been put in F
iperation in New Orleans lor two or throe weeks,1
md its success tested in the presence of a largo j
lumber of planters, merchants and others, and a
eceived their genprnl approbation. , ??

Dr. A Jo es?Dear Sir, in anewei tc your inquiry
of my opinion of your Patent Cotton Gin, I
beg leave to slate, that 1 was fifteen years cngarod
in the cotton factories of Manchester, Eng.
and, and during four years of that time,] was
brctnsn ir. the house of Messrs. Lewis, Williams
V Co., and dear five years spinner in the house of
Messrs. Sand ford &. "Crone. I have seen your
Jolt on Gin in operation, and have examined the
ottun ginned hy i , and pronounce it belter c leansed.
and the staple less injured, than any cotton
hat ever came under my observation. It is com>U
tely rem y for the breaker without the aid of the
ilower. and would, therefore, save the first profess
n manufacturing the article 1 consider cotton
demised by your Gin, would command from one
o two cents on the pound more than the average
mps brought into the Manchester market, and
:leansed by common Gins Yours, very irsip'ly
