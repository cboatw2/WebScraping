ADDRESS OF NICHOLAS RIDDLE, ESQ., !
BEFORE TIIE AURlCl'LTl'Il A I. SOCIETY OK
PHILADELPHIA COI N'TY, O.N THE >5T1I OCT.
18-10. j
Gentleman?We are assembled to wit-1
ness our first exhibition since the recent \
donation l>v the Slate. Our Society
? while engaged with all its own resources
in improving our agriculture, appealed to
the legislature, as consisting mainiy ot
farmers, and asked that whilst so many!
tnillirtnc vvoro ovni?nrli>(l in :he transnorta- I
llliia iviio ?? v? v ... ~ g
tion of our produce, something should be
given to assist in rendering those produotions
themselves more abun Junt and more
valuable. Accordinglv a law was passed
placing, every year, at iho disposal of the
society, a stun of lifty dollars for each '
member of the Legislature from the city j
and county of Philadelphia, to be paid on: j
of the taxes raised within the city. This j
though small in amount, is important from i
the example; nor in entering upon tin !
lirst enjovment of it, should we omit ou? :
%
thanks to the Legislature for this mark o. <
regard to the farming interests, to the
members from the city and county who !i.
l>erally supported it, and those members o?
this Society to whose ex r'ions we owe
the success of this application?among !
whom it would he great injustice not to j
name George \V. Roberts, R. T. Potts, j
and Captain Thomas Hayes?but in cspe- j
rial manner are the acknowledgements of
_ _ all farmers, due to Mr. James, (Jowen,!
who is always in the front rank where pub- !
lie spirit or private liberality is needed.
The Society have thought that no cm- j
ploymentof the additional moans confi led
to them, would he so useful as tohring the
farmers together, to exhibit the best speci
mens of their industry ; end by small but i
honorable premiums to encourage a gene
rous competition in every branch of farm- !
ing productions. The prizes for the best
crops must be decided at a later pe riod of
the season. But the exhibition of farming !
stock and farming implements, is now be- j
fore you ; and it is made my duty to add :
something appropriate to the occasions. 1
This 1 do cheerfully?and what I shall say
will be very plain, very practical, and, as i
you will learn with pleasure, very short.
My purpose is to say a few words about
the real condition of fanning in Pcnnsyl
vania?its natural advantages?it acquired
means?and then suggest such improv- !
ciuents as may make our farms make |
more productive. 1
There are perhaps few portions of the
earth more favored by nature than Pennsylvania.
Her soil is excellent and various?while
even the parts least adapted in
themselves for agriculture, furnish the !
best encouragement for it; for the bills
which reject the plough are tilled with coal
and iron, which collect large masses of
people to he fed by the farmers. Iler climate
is a happy medium between the long
winters of northern regions, which close
the eurth for so many months against farm
labor, and consumes so much of its produce
in earning the farm stock over long
months of idleness, and, on the other side,
the unvarying heat of southern latitudes,
often unhealthy and unproductive, where j
both man and cattle degenerate. In this
i
climate almost every production may he
naturalized, so that in point of soil and season,
and variety of productiveness, Pennsylvania
is distinguished.
These natural advantages she has also
the means of improving by artificial means
for the limestone, so great an element in
farming, is found everywhere, in the greatest
abundance; Plaster of Paris is oh. ;
tained easily, and at low prices, from her
neighbor, New York ; the large cities fur- !
nish vast supplies of animal manures;
while, on the other side of the Delaware,
lies a great belt of green sand, erroneously
called marl, an original deposite of the ocean,
where, among bones of extinguished
^ races of animals, and relics of a sumbcrgcd
^ world, there is brought up this sand, highly
useful, even in its natural state, and, if
mixed with lime, as it should be, of great
efficacy.
The implements of husbandry come
next in order, and these we have of the
very best kind, much bettor than similar
implements in Europe?lighter?more ea- j
sily handled?and there arc one or two in
common use with us, such for instance as
the horse-rake, and that giant instrument
the cradle, which are unknown or unused
abroad. In truth, our people have had so ;
much to do with comparatively small i
rijeans, that their ingenuity has been tad;-!

I ed to invent the most active use of them, i
Tims ihrre are two words in almost all j
!a:)g:ng?s, and wci! defined in most dictionaries,
but of which Europeans have
scarcely an idea, and these are the axe
and the pleach. To cut down a tree, the
grc.at business of American settlers, is a
strange event to a European farmer. And
then it may make us smile to see, as we >
may on the continent of Europe, at the
present time, a whole drove of horses?I <
have myself actually seen eight in a single i
plough?-and. sometimes the w hole quadruped
force of the farm, three or four cows,
and perhaps a bull or two, with the aid of
several horses, toiling s'owly through the
great work up the sod?nay, even in some 1
parts of England, at this moment, maybe ;
seen six large horses, with two full grown 1
men, returning from the field after having ]
ploughed, during the day, three-quarters of
an acre or an acre?where one of our
ploughmen, with a pair of horses, would
have got through an acre or an acre and a
half. <
From the implements let us turn to our
t
stock of animals. :
And first of our horses :
Beginning with the highest blooded
stock, 1 think it probable that: the United
States possess quite as good a race as there
is in Europe. The prevailing opinion is,
that the Arabian horse is the original of
that animal. I doubt the historical fact?
but it it be so, he is the parent stock of the
hor.se, just as the father of all apples is the
Crab, which has been sweetened bycuhi- 1
vation into the Bell-llow cr. Undoubtedly
the Arabian has improved the English
horse?has given him finer sinews, more
compact bones, and greater intelligence,
till the cross has become unavaidably the :
iirs' of his kind. The truth is that a race
s but a quick succession of long jumps,
and the little light Aral) is out-jumped by
the gigantic stride of th ? stronger, larger,
longer-logged English horse, who lias beaten
hi:n on Ins own sands in ihe East, and
would distance him on any course in Europe.
Indeed, lhe vor\ first Arabion imported
into England two centuries ago,
called the Murkham Arabian, was constantly
beaten : and my impression is, that
to Arabian horse ever did win a race in 1
England. Tne belief of our breeders, is i
that whatever good there niav be in the i
Arabian is exceeding slow in show- i
ing itself; that he has already given to 1
the English horse all he can give, and that <
it is on the whole safer to adh-rc to the ;
highest bred English stock, rather than <
risk its degeneracy by any inferior mixture. 1
Our blood horscst therefore, come directly i
from England, and it is rather odd that t
r?
the King of England's stables, furnished
the highest priced horses for republican
VmoricM. Of the comparative estimation
oft lie English .in?! Arabian horse we have
lately sec a a striking example. The ImaumofM
iscai smit to the President of the
United S ates two Arabian horses, which,
from the character of the giver, we are
hound to presume were of the highest class.
These horses were sold at public auction,
and no one could be found to give more
them than six hundred and fifty dollars for
one, and six I mud red and seventy-five for the
other. Now, in the same neighborhood
where these were sold, are very spirited
breeders, who would not buy these Arakians
at even so low a rate, but who had
actually brought from the stables of the
King of Eng'and. at the price of twenty- '
live thousand do!!ars; a favorite horse, Pri-1
run, one of whose colts is in the exhibition <
7 # i
here. Even as between the English breed
and our own, the impression on this side
of the water is, that for some time past the
tendency of English breeders is rather to
encourage speed than bottom ; that their
horses are becoming leggy, and thai the
descendants of tire English stock, in this
country, have more endurance, more bottom
for long heats, than their English ancestors.
The question, whenever it is tested,
will he decided perhaps by a few seconds.
This style of horse, although the
use to which he is generally applied, is out
of the way of the farmer, is yet very intcrerting
to us ; for iiis good qualities all
come down through the inferior races ;
and the Godolphia Arabian, to which the
English horse owes so much of his superiority,
was actually a cart-horse in Paris.
Our ordinary race of farm horses is extremely
good; the wants and variableness
of the climate have settled down the stilf
and heavy of the European horse and given
a race of quick alert animals admirably
fitted to second the activity of the farmer
himself.
So with respect to cattle, we have almost
every variety and the best of all var
ietics. The emigrants often bring their
D .
best and favorite animal, the passenger
vessels bring cows to give milk during their
voyages, and be then profitably sold here ;
and these are generally of the highest kind;
commerce imports from every quarter the,
animals which will ;>av best, and arc therefore
the best at borne; and spirited breeders,
have gone into the English markets 1
and brought over some of the highest priced
animals. The result is, that we have
| a great accumulation of stock of every
I description. These arc the AMerncys,
; with their rich milk, itself a cream. The
Ay rehires, copious givers of milk, strongly
inclined to butter, with forms tilted for the
butcher. TheDcvons, ;>n ancient race
brought by (he first settlers of New England,
and indicating their descent by their
strong resemblance to the improved Devons,

tlioir milkiness, for the dairy, by their del- i
icatc flesh for the knife, by'their quickness j
for the plough they claim to be second to j
no other race: and if second to any, only to !
the Short horned-Durham, which is so fa-1
miliar to us all as to require no description, j
which undoubtedly now unites the great- j
est mass of suffrages in its favor, as com- {
billing the qualities of abundant milk, of j
easy fattening, of early maturity .and of j
excellent food, more than any other race of
horned cattle.
Of Sheep, too, we have all the varieties.
The Leicester, with their early fitness j
for the knife, and their large carcasses and :
large wool?the Merino for its smaller
yield of ricli wool?the Southdown, excellent
for both wool and carcess?and, |
finally, we have a less known breed coming
into reputation ; it is the Tunisian, or
broad-tailed sheep?originally sought main-'
ly for the carcass, but, having proved it- j
self very hardy, well acclimated when
crossed by other breeds, so as to acquire a
finer wool, it may become a standard stock
among us. Nor arc we less favored in j
Swine.
We have all the breeds; among others, j
<\ 1 1 r\ ? 1 Aim ^fi*n f if on 11 1 tllO '
|M*UU11U1 I > UUI U^ II( 15 ? Hill I5 vaiitu mv |
Chester County breed, and the Berkshire j
breed, just coming into great, deserved cs-1
limation among us. Even the common
breeds, that run alout without our knowing (
tlieir extraction, arc often admirable. I
remember well that the Pcnnsylvanian '
Quaker farmer, Jacob Brown, commander- J
in-chief of the American army during the !
late war, told me how much he was struck !
hy the beauty of the bogs which he saw
running about Philadelphia; and I have
since often had occassion to admire them.
Of all these various animals we have
specimens now before us which we may !
all examine, and if we desire it, obtain |
them at reasonable rates; and no one ran '
doubt the real economy to a farmer of pos-;
scssing these improved breeds. An infe-1
rior animal takes as much trouble and as :
much food as a good one, and then the I
care and the expense are often thrown a- j
way upon cattle that will give neither,
milk nor beef. How many stunted milch j
cows do we see who may be said to go dry j
nil the year round?how may steers Wud, j
after emptying a whole corn crib, at last]
in the spring look like the crib itself, all j
ribs without, and all hollow inside ! But
crossing and training have created animals
who turn at once into milk or beef every
thing we put into them?who give plenty
of milk, if you want milk, plenty of fat
if you desire beef; and who, coming earlier
tnto the dairy or the market, save a whole
year's expense of feeding. I hope, therefore,
that we may profit by the present opportunity
of improving our stock, and encourage
the spirited breeders who place
the means of doing it iu our power.
Nor are the produations of Pennsylvania
less numerous than its animals. The
great staples are wheat, rye barley, oats,
buckwheat, and, above all, Indian corn ; a
plant not estimated in Europe, but one of
the most valuable presents which the new
world lias made to the old?worth almost
ail others in the extent of its yield and the
variety of its uses ; with a stalk ten or fifteen
feet high, every inch of which is useful
in the barn or the ham-yard,and a grain
which to men supplies a variety of healthful
and delicious dishes, and to cattle, is
quickest fat toner, while it gives the
last exquisite flavor to their flesh.
Having thus spoken of the advantages
which wo Pennsylvania farmers enjoy, I)
proceed to the less agreeable but more J
profitable inquiry, why our farms arc not j
> * i - i? it:
so productive as tnev ouguiro ue, anu i
make the comparison between Pennsylvania
and England, because I think England,
on the "whole, the best farming conn- I
try in Europe, and our English friends |
must understand, that while we amuse j
ourselves occasionally with some of their j
peculiarities, we pay thcin the highest |
compliment we can, by proposing them as j
the constant models of our farming. Now ;
why is it, that with all the natural advantages
in our favor, the English farmers
beat us ? I will tell you what I think of it.
In the first place, we do not do justice
to our own profession. Farming is not
liked, either among the young people, because
it is considered a lonely exile from
gaiety?or among the calculating, because
it is thought unproductive. This last is, I
think, a total misapprehension, and, as I
regard its correction essential to our success,
I venture to say that farming ought \
to be more profitable in Pennsylvania !
than in England. The common notion
is that the high price of labor in Pennsylvania
makes farming unproductive, and j
thr* nnimnn is ronentf>d without CXaUlina- !
tion, till at last it is generally believed.
Now the productiveness of farming, like
the productiveness of every other occupation,
depends on the expense of raising an
article and the price you get for it when
it is raised. These expenses are rhe rci\t
of the huef the taxc* the manure, the pri- j
cos of laboring cattle, of laboring iinplc- :
menfs, and oi laboring men.
The land which can he rented in America
for two or three dollars, could not be j
rented tn England under ten or twelve j
dollars, an acre?so that already the land ;
itself costs three or four times as much, j
When you have got possession of the land, J
ilie tax-gatherer and tho tithe-man scon j
make their appearance, and take fron} the j
farmer iifly-thrce per cent, on his rent, j
I fere there arc no tidies, and the tax, out'
nm'/msiwmm
???w?? worn yj* >m*i i.i?r
M'JDNESDAY, NOVEMBK
of the immediate vicinity of the city im-j
provefflents would scarcely be one-tenth !
of thelEnglish tax?so that while on an
English farm of two hundred acres the rent i ,
and charges would be about 83,000 ' j
The same rent and charges would i <
here be 700 j,
I 1
Making at once a difference of 82,300 ]
Next, all manures are cheaper in Penn- j,
sylvania?cheaper in themselves, and rcn- j (
dered more cheap by the facilities of trail- j (
sportation. (
Laboring horses are about one-fourth |
cheaper in Pennsylvania ; and, moreover, ^
the work which two horses do in England j
is generally (lone here by one. Cows, j .
too are much cheaper here. j
Laboring implements are cheaper and ; j
better, the wood being so much lower pri- },
ced and durable. Of all these elements of j i
work, there remains only laboring men J ,
who are cheaper in England; they are | ,
cheaper by about CO or 35 per cent ; but j ,
even say that wages are 50 per cent, high- 11
er in Pennsylvania than in England. ,
Then, although the nominal rate of wages ! (
is higher, yet you actually get more work j ]
done for the money. The climate gives | ,
you more long working days than can be j (
relied upon in the climate of England, \ {
where out-door work is necessarily much i j
suspended, ond the American laborer i
u*nr ks better, for the verv reason that he ! :
is paid better. And the proof, which ,
seems decisive, is that although money ?
wages are higher here, piece-work, con- j
tract-work?whether to dig a canal or to ]
reap a field, is done cheaper in America. ,
And accordingly, one of our most intcllig- ,
?nt Philadelphia county farmers, Mr. W.il- |
ker, an Englishman, always declared tha* .
his larm-work was done twenty per cent. I
cheaper in Pennsylvania than in England. ,,
Put supposing it to he higher?labor is ,
only one of the elements, for we have seen j,
that the rents are three or four times as i,
high taxes ten times as high, manures,
implements, cattle, all dearer?and far over
balancing any difference of wages, were it
even real.

Remedy fou the Bots.
Mf.sser*. Gaylord & Ticker.?In j
my early day?, mv father, being fond of I
good horses, paid great attention to their
health, and whenever he apprehended that
his horse was affected with the bots, had
recourse to strong salt water, generally
brino in which beef had been salted, and
it appeared to have a favorable effect on
the animal. The brine was given first
without any thing proceeding if; but after j
my ncghbor made tho following expcri- i
mcnts, we changed our course of practice. !
A twoycarsold horse having died of disease, |
our neighbor opened him, and taking the j
oesophagus (or ozen,asit is perhaps more j
generally called,) from the stomach, split :
it open, and exposed the grub to fair view
?he found their heads deeply embedded
in the cellular substance; lie then dropped j
a few drops of brine on some of them,!
which indueed those that it touched to
contract and adhere with greater tenacity
?lie then dropped on some others some
molasses, which instantly produced a different
effect; they appeared to expand and j
and slacken their hold; on to these he then I
dropped some beef brine as at first, which j
caused them immcdiataly to let go their i
hold and fly off from their formercstation. !
lie found that by this oursc, he could dis- !
lodge them whenever he pleased; hence
the expediency of administering some
* i i .1 i _
thing sweet anangreeame oeioreme urine
is given, is clearly suggested. As there
is tio doubt that the insect which is called
the hot bee, depositing the egg or nit on j
the hair of the horse, produces the grub in
the stomach by being taken in at the j
mouth, it is very desirable to prevent their \
continuance on the horse where he would ;
be likely to take them into his month by ?
biting himself, which 1 have seen one j
horse show great reluctance to do ; he deliberately
viewed the part thickly covered '
with nits, and after hesitation contracting '
his lips, with his teeth, bit the part, and j
then as if to avoid all adhesion of the nits, ;
he gave a very sudden motion to his lips. !
These little eggs or nits are easily romov- :
ed and destroyed, by rubbing on them al- J
most any kind of oil or greasy substance. !

of salt and one pound of saltpetre. Huh 1
the skin well with the hand until it be- j
comes moist, then pack the hams iu a j
trough as close as possible. If the seas-1
on is not unusually cold, five weeks is :
long enough to let it lay in brine. Then i

hang up and put smoKe oi good green

it has enough. Take down by the first of j

BEEi?
Mr. Keith, of Maine, in a cominunica- fr
tion to the Monthly Visitor, after describ- In
ing several modes of managing bees, and fr
the ill sttecess that attended them, thus in li<
substance gives the result of an expert- ki
ment made by placing them in a garret.? E
lie finished a room in his garret imper- tl
l ious to rats and mice, to which was a p<
ioor secured against children and inlru- n
Jers.* In this room was placed a swarm fc
if be^s, the hive on a level with and near to
the places made for their egress and in- m
ress. The young swarm soon filled their 01
live, and then commenced building all fc
iroundit, filling in with the finest comb, p<
ind without the support of slate or bars, b<
;he spac* from the roof of the tloor of their c<
:oom. Mr. Keith, by the aid of a candle, 411
Aras able at any time to inspect the pro- ct
jress of his apiary, and witness the for- w
nations of the column of comb. There m
*as no swarming, and of course the work rc
lad the benefit of all their increase in ti
numbers. Alter the second year ot tneir c<
operations, Mr. Keith commenced taking tl
loncy from the room, doing it in the win- tc
rcr when the bees were dormant, in the ai
central parts of the mass; these external U
:ombs alwavs composing the best and ol
* i o
surest part of the store. For many years
Mr. Keith's table was abundantly supplied b<
in this way with the choicest of sweets, P1
until in 1^?his dwelling house was de- n
roved hy fire, and his bee-hive, "contain- '
ing at the least eight hundred pounds of ^
honey, and of living beings a multitude b
which no mail could number," shared the n
common fate. c
From what we have seen, and have been fi
ible to learn on this subject, the mode of A
treating bees as above described is superi- fi
r>r to most others, for the following rcas- tl
wis. It prevents in most cases any swarm- tl
ing; the bees are not as frequently attacked
and destroyed by the bee-moth; there P
is no necessity of destroying the bee as is e
the common but cruel practice; and the c
store of honey is always at command.? ,J
They honey bee is one of the most valu- v
able of our manufacturers; and it and the r
silk-worm almost the only insects that con- a
tribute by their industry to the comfort of s
man. ^

Silk.
Mount Pleasant, O. Sept. 20, 1840.
Mr. Hooper,?Dear Sir:?Observing
that the second Vol. of the Western Far- 1
mcr will commence on the first of October,
and considering it among the most valuable
of our western papers, in did using
useful information, I herewith enclose the
coming year's subscription ; I also propose i
offering through your columns, a few re- i
marks on the culture and manufacture of i
Silk. r
As I have somewhat devoted my atten- 1
tion to this subject, for the last few years, i
I have come to the conclusion, that this i
country could produce and manufacture 1
the large amount of Silks consumed here, r
of foreign production ; and save the an- |
nual export of forty millions of dollars of t
our precious metals to pay for them. With i
this important fact before me, I common- i
cod the cultivation of the Mortis Multi- <
caulis, and Italian mulberry, about three t
years ago, and have now about fifteen c
acres permanently set with standard trees, 1
principally Morus Multicaulis ; and many t
thousands more growing from cuttings.? (
Sixteen months ago, I commenced making t
arrangements for feeding silk worms, and t
o - establishing
a manufactory. I obtained t
a suitable snpcrintendant, John Fox Esq. a ?
practical manufacturer of silks, formerly (
of London : and during the first twelve I
months, we succeeded in constructing t
machinery, and manufactured about one r
thousand dollars worth of velvets, plush t
and other fabrics from cocoons of our own r
raising, and those raised in this vicinity. 1
From my experience and success last year t
I became convinced that the culture and t
manufacture of Silk, could be carried on c
with profit in this country, and have this 3
summer lilted out a regular Silk Factory, 1
on the European plan, viz: three Piedmon- c
tese reels with winding machines, and a
throwsters or twisting machines, and other
nr>rn*<tirv machinery, propelled by an t
eight horse power steam engine ; also six 1
looms, all of which are now in daily opera- f
tion, furnish constant employment to six- \
teen hands, which I find no difficulty in t
in procuring at foreign prices. We arc r

! am raising cocoons very successfully,
ad purchase all good cocoons offered at

per bashcl; and properly reeled, at
om five to shl dollars per pound. I before
this is the only establishment of tho

leonomy, Pa.) but i art* well satisfied,
us business must soon become an imDrtant
branch of American indastry, and *
ecds hut correct information, tad the

a protective tarifif on r^w and.
lanufactured silks (which by a strange
rersight, are admitted free of duty,) say
>r seven years at Least, of twenty.five
2rcent: and this to be appropriated in
:>unty as follows, say fifteen or'twenty
?nf ncr nnnnd on cocoons, one dollar Der
? ,? J . ? t
imid on reeled silk^, and twenty-five p r
?nt on the manufactured article. This
ould give the business a start and perlanency,
that no foreign influence could
isist: by that time we would EUMiufacire
more in the United Skates than is
Dnsumed, and our exports world rival
latof cotton in value. It i* now admit:d
that no part of the wcrld is better
dapted to the raising of silk: in fact the
'. States Silk is considered superior to all
there.
i would recommend that each neighorhood
throughout the U. States, should
etition Congress to this effect, jU the
ext session: and the citizens of this
tale should also call the attention of the
legislature to the encouragement of this
usiness; it being a new branch of busicss
with us, it will at first require enourag-ment
and protection, bit when
rnily established will take care of itself.
tS proof, i would observe, that our manuictured
goo Is cost less to produce them,
lan the package price at New York, although
admitted duty free.
The manufacture of silk is more simle
than either wool or cotton. To those
ngaged in the business of raising co?
oons, I recommend perseverence; there
j a fair demand for all raised ; if they
rish to raise them for manufacturing, I
ecommend the Piedmontese reel before
.11 others, on account of its cheapness,
peed, and the perfect thread it turns off.
rhe beauty and goodness of the thread
onsists in keeping it even and twisting
huii round each other from twelve to
wSwy-five times, according to run of
hrcad between first and second guides,
rhe most saleable is an even thread of
:ight or ten fibres. For families to. make
ewing silks, I recommend Brooks

DURHAM CATTLE.?AT WHAT AGE BESTTO
IMPOKT THE3I?WILL THRIVE ON
OUR WORST PASTURES AND MAY BE
BRED FROM AT ONE YEAR OLD.
Dear Sir?Having read several articles
n your paper on the Durham cattle, I
vrite you this to add to the mass of inforliation
already presented to the public,
rhe experience of your other friends dif.
crs so entirely t'roin my own, that I am
nclined to believe some of us have fallen
nto error. It is affirmed that the i>urmms
are too delicate in the constitution,
equire more feed, and in all other reslects
a re more unsuited to our climate than
he ofher breed of cattle. My experience
s directly the other way. For the last six
pears I have seen many Durhanis, Dev>ns,
and seme Ayreshire, imported into
Charleston and its vicinity. Under/>rop\r
treatment thev have all of them fulfiled
here the respective characteristics
hey have always borne clseirhere. Unler
improper treatment they have all of
hem suffered from delicacy of constituion,
&:c. All cattle imported from abroad
o become acclimated, must undergo tfoe
same changes of constitution as foreign- .
;rs coming for the first time amongst us.
if you expect cattle from Europe, where
hey are generally housed, and fed on the
idlest and best food, to k( ep healthy and
at, when turned out upon razor-shaved
neadoxvs, and corn-stalk fields, you will
je sadly disappointed, and even when
loused ami well fed, if you expect them not
o pa n t dtrring our summers, and to die un* .
ler the ifluence of our noxious climate,

oolv for health and beauty on the cheek
f a mountain lass working amid the miisma
of our low country rice-fields.
Most of us, at a very high price, import
he Durham cattle when full grown.?
Their constitutions have been already
ormed and accustomed to the cfimate
vhcnce they came, and it is impossible forhem
to undergo the radical and necessa-.
v change required here. Were we toira-.
>ort at a younger age, the result would
le different. Out of twenty or thirty
mils and cows imported from Europe*
he north, and Kentucky, during the past
ear, I know of as few that have not stood
>ur climate.
