c
vince you, that the spirit of public improve- a'
mnent was indeed "abroad in our land," and t
that Charleston was about to assume that f
high station which belongs to her as the s
chief city of the South. Already had we f
begun to realize the first fruits of these pa
triotic exertions. The eyes of the lihole I
South, and of a large portion of the West.
were turned towards us with an interest I
which promised the happiest results. While <
grand sceleisof inprovenient werein pro
"ress, looking to the advancement of our
intercourse with the interior, and the ex
tension of our direct trade with all foreign I
nations, we were striving- to improve the
health of the city, and to furnish the neces
sary facilities for an enlarged and extending
commerce. Your Excellency 'must have i
seen) with satisfaction the fruits tif this sys
ten so strongly illustrated in the spirit of
industry, which was every where dilaycd
inl the crection of noble public edifices. the
Multiplication and iipromentit of stores
and private dwellings, and the extension of
all the sources of public prosperity and pri
vate happiness. In a sitngle t night this glo
rious prospect was sudhdenly ald entirely
changed. Our beautiful city was laid in
ashes. Mouldering walls and blackened
ruins mark the spots where our habitations
stood. Thousands of our people, who a fe!w
days ago wet e in the cjoytment of all the
comforts of life, have beeti deprived of their
all, and are indebted tot he kindness ol'their 1
firiends for shelter and support. Labor has
bect deprived of its accustomed enploy
imenlt, and property of its value. The in
cotmes of all have been greatly reduced,
and of many totally destroyed.
The true ebartact r and extent of this
calamity will be cit urly tndverstoo( froti a
very bricfstatemnctt. From a careful esti
mate of the losses sustained, it appears tlat
about five hundred dwelling houses fronting
on the public streets, have bet i totally con
sunied, and( an enal nutber of kitchens or
other buildings occupied iy zlaves, miakin.
together upwards of one thousand dwelling
hatses destroyed, exclusive of a large num
tier ol'other ont buildiig'. It is i-possible
to ascertain the titnber of personswho oc
cupied these dwellings, buot they have been
estitated at from 5 to 7000.
We have no miani of ascerltaitinlg tie
value ofprope'rty thus lost. B t it whe it is
recollected that this destrtction of property
has ftllen upon tile very heart ef the City,
containing a iniiber ofstores of great value
anti that goods, asq.well as firniture, to a
contsiderable atmotnt, iave ben i estroed,
it may safely be assumted11.11 that the a moiunt
of our los.-es cannot have fallen much short
of' four millions of dollars. It has been as
certainied that of tle property destroyed,
aboitt m6e mlillion and a half of dollars were
insured. bt ofthis, upwardis of one million
was insured in Charleston, (involving the
entire capital of two of ouir lusitrance Comn.
panics. out of three.) So that a clear loss
has been sutstained by this cotmzmulity, of'
three iillions of' dollars. Taitg i con
sideration the amount of -or populat ion, and
the extent of our resources, it is believed
that Charleston has, on this occasion, sus
taield L greater loss than was suffeted ei
ther by London or New York, onl the oce-:l
sioIs of witat were eilphatically called 'the
geat fires,' at these places. Ve present

had been one of an ordiitry character-if'
,only a few hundred houses-valued at a few
hundred hundred thousand dollars, had been
destroyed. tite citizens of' Cl1arle.stol wotuli1

The Charleston Calamity.--A pulblic

urday evening, to devise imeaures 1or the

det.-ined iv her owners4 ti!l to monow, in
order to take, free of charge, anly supplies
for the sull'erers whichi may hc given.
Tle City Council of our own city. has
acted promptly in this matter, and will,we
trust, be sustained by tile liberality of' our
fellow citizens. It is at junciures like the
present that mntitficence call best display
itself' in the cause of a ruined commiunity,
and now if ever, should the wealthy of the
other cities come forward in aid of the suf
ferers in Charleston,

, 4~ilSTI.A.1 BOAT DISASiT'.R.
The New Orleans papers of the 21th.inst
comuain an account of a most drendfuil steamn
boat disaster. From the Bullutia we copy
the lollowing- particnlar.:
The steatlioat Oronoko, Urawford,nas
ter, ience oil her pasage 14) Louisville, coi.
lapsed oneo of ier boiler flues on Saturday
morning last at .5 O'lock while takin' inl
somie lazisenagers at l'rinceton, and out of
seventy deck passenAers ilonly one escaped
being scalded t c deat!l or dangerously
wounded. Many jumped overboard after
ilcy were scalded, thinkin-, no douht, to
obtain relief, and were drowned. Several
were lefi at Princetoerf at least 15, dead or
horribly mangled.
Only onie Catlin passenger, a Mr. Brown,
was lost. Mrs: Myers and her child, from
Vickthurg. were sealded-the latter died
immaelieiately. aid little holpesare entertain
ed f tie mothier. Out of thirly three who ,
were left on board the Oronoko nine died
before she ret urned to Vicksburg, and pro
hably, but live or six of those renainir"
would survive twenty four hours. Amon'
the dead is One or the en!gincers, Mr. Pow
ers, who during his last moments. asserted
that the fault was not his, as there was a
sufficient supply of water in the boilers at
tile I imeo of the accident.
Th greater jotiron of these unfortunatc
individuals "ere taken onl board at Vicks
bitrg, and their natmes andi dcstination, had
nlot, nor could not be ascertaiied, neither
was the exact tnumber on board known. but,
dotatless, seventy five individuals sufflered
by the explosion, but few of whom can sur
've.
From the .,w Orleans Picayune of tho
26th inagt, we extract the foillowing addition
;al partietlars:
'Iat: OILo:ono.-The annmber of thoso
who perished or were badly wounded, is
not exactlv known-it is variously estima
ted fram 4,40 to 150. Of 20 wounded left at
Princeton, 13 have since died-and of 30
brought to Vicksburg, 16 have died. The
iwihabitants of these Itwo places attended
w ith a .rvat daal of kindness to the sufferers.
It is staled that the steamer Peru, passed
tp shortly ater the accident, and although
hailed ajy every signal ofdistress,-not only
bI rm;:m;; the bell, but by some hundred
persons running to and from the bank, wav
ing, their handkerchiefs anti exhibitin
sheets, from the hurricane deck of the Oro
noko, she kept hetr course without render
iaig any aUtsitance whatever, and after as
aaitiance was obtained from the steamers
"Ne w Albany," and "independence," she
retartied, and without oiering aany assistat
hand, obtainaId1 all lhe passetigers she could
aid procceded oan her way.
''lae iahnutainaaity of tht. commander ofthc
l'mr, as stated in the last l para2raph depend
altogether uptn a vagu report. It is thought
to be a ns-i,-tatement.
The cause of the acrilent it is said, was
the worn-out state of the boilers. The
other part of the boat gas thoroughly new ;
the boilers, however, h1tad been taken fron
an Old vessel, and wtere totally unfit for ser
vice. It has been stated. (says the Bulletin
of Wednesblay) by one of the oldest boat
aelin now on the river, that the boilers on
the Oroooko originally were the America's
loat which stnak at Plum Point, some time
in 8:5 or e. 1er boilers were earried
to Pittsburg ani there remained utmil IS31
or 18I2. 'ley were thea pat oti hoard the
steaier .lichigan. and froem her removed
to the OronokU where thae explosion oecr
red. These are startlii;t hacs if true; a re
gard to the safety of thae travelling worhil
requires that they shoultd be sifted to the
lottom.
It has been aszeraed that nine accidents
onat of teat, oi or waters arises frot the ase
tftoldl boilers in anew bo~as. Suach anm asser
uiona is sezareaely credilhe. We tare untwillin -
to bieheve thtth elnpcidiity of stetam boat
