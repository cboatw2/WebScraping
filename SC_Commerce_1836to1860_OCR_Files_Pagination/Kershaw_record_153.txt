The convention met pursuant to adjournment,
and was called to order at 12
o'clock by the chairman.
The secretary then read the minutes
af the last meeting which were confinned.

since the adjournment of Tuesday,
then came forward and gave in their
names, viz: JNl^srs. J. K. Douglass, C.
F. Shannon, and C. Matheson\of Catnien,
S. C.
The President then called on the select
wmmittec for their * report, whereupon
'he Hon. Gcortie Mcltuflic. the chair
man, rose, and read 111 a clear and impressive
manner, the following Report
and Resolutions:
The Select Committee raised for the
puipose of ascertaining and reporting,
what measure will, in their opinion, most
effectually contribute to the accomplishment
of the great object of ibis Convention,
ask leave to submit the following
REPORT:
The committee are deeply impressed
with the importance of the duty assigned
them,' and have bestowed upon it all the
attention their limited time would permit.
>. They regard the present derangement
of the currency and exchanges of the
country, however we may depreciate its
causes and deplore its immediate effects,
as furnishing an occasion, which, if wisely
improved, will relieve the staple-growing
States from a state of commercial
dependence, scarcely less reproachful to
their industry and cnterprize, than it is
incompatible with their substantial prosperity.
The staple-growing States, while they
produce two-thirds of the domestic exports
of the United States, import scarce
Iy one-tenth of the foreign merchandize
which is received in exchange for it.
Almost the whole of the foreign commerce
which is founded upon the productions
of our industry, is carried on by the citizens
of other States, causing their cities
to flourish, while our's have been sinking
into decay.
In the opinion of the committee, the
period, has arrived, when our Citizens are
invoked by the united voice of interest
and patriotism, to put an end to this voluntary
tribute, amounting annually to something
like ten millions of dollars. It is
believed that the quota of Georgia and
S- uth Carolina ai<?ne, amounts to not
less than three millions of dollars.?It
may not be disguised, however, that this
extraordinary and unequal state of our
pnmmprrinl n Litinns. had its oriffin. inure
in tlic fiscal operations of the federal government
than in any supposed deficiency
in the industry and entcrprize of our citizens.
The h'gli duties imposed by the
tariff of 1810 upon the productions of
Southern industry, and the still more enormous
duties imposed by those of 1824 and
1828, combined with the unequal system
of depositing and disbursing the revenue
thus collected, almost-excius?veTy in the
Northern cities, operated as a bounty to
the commerce of those cities, which the
most persevering industry and entcrprize
on our part, could not have overcome.
Great and obvious as were the natural advantages
of our Southern cities, .they were
more than counterbalanced by these operations
of the government. And whilst
v * -
? - - 111
we stood amidst the ruins thus produced
; by misgovemment, many of our own citizens
were utterly unable to account for
. the phenomenon,, and some of our charitable
neighbors supposed it to be owing
to the curse of llcaven upon our domestic
instructions.
Every practical man, however, will at
once perceive, that the deposite of almost
the whole of the government funds, in the
banks of the Northern cities, was equiva.
lent to a loan of a like sum without interest,
and that the immense sums disbursed
'by the government at the same points,
operated even more decidedly to give
those cities an undue ascendency. One
of the most obvious and salutary consequences
which we may confidently anticipate
from the reduction of the duties and
the withdrawal of the government do
posites from the hanks, will be the restoration
of the S ut hern cities to a condition
of comparative equality in the business of
foreign commerce. In a fair and equal
competition, it cannot be doubted, that they
will be able to exchange our domestic
productions for the manufactures of Europe,
by a d rect trade, more advantageous
y, than the Northern cities can do
it, by a circuitous process, involving intermediate
tiansfers and agencies, all
increasing the risk and expense of the
ope rati n.
There never was presented to the capitalists
of the South and South-west such
an opening for pr tit able ente/prizc, and
they are invited by the most powerful
considerations to improve it. Now that
the fisca' operations of the federal government
have been so greatly reduced, and
the field of competition fa rly-opened, if
they sh >uid still look on with listless apa!
thy, while the mighty current of our own
n ?i 1 >).. u..

them, to nourish distant cine* and fortalize
tlie barren hills of distant communities,
we must then, aequosce in the judgment
which the world w 11 pronounce,
thai we deserve our destiny. But the
' commit tec iudu'ge the contid nt belief that
isucli a reproach will no longer rest upon
us. The public spirit of our people bas
* been roused into action, they have been
awakened to a sense of their condition, and
! all arc prepared to co-oporatc, in their
respective spheres, in the great work of
throwing oft* the shackles of our present
colonial condition and establishing our
commercial independence upon a lasting
i foundation.
j The staple-mowing States never can be
, practically independent and enjoy the full
mi'usun} mi m? doiiiitics which i'rovMionce
lhas so abundantly provided for thorn,
| until the commerce which is founded upon
their valuable productions shall be carried
on by our own merchants, permanently
resident amongst us, whether they be
' native or adopted. The pursuits of commerce
must be liberalized, the commercial
class must be elevated, in public opinion
to the rank in society which property
belongs to it. The avocation of the merchant
requires- as much character and
talent and is of as much dignity and usefulness,
as any other pursuit or profession;
; and the senseless prejudice which would
assign to it an inferior rank, has been
1 Kli II? 1 1 f -l -
uniHiiy uorroweu irom inosc ancient rc{publics
and modern despotisms, whose
policy it was to regard war as the only
' honorable pursuit. As agricultural productions,
whirh find their market prmci'
pally in foreign countries, constitute the
almost exclusive source of wealth, the
mercantile class is as indispensable to our
prosperity, as the agricultural. Their interests
are iuseperably identfied, and
whatever etFocta the prosperity of the
one, must have a corres]x>nding influence
jon the other. How much, then, does the
general welfare of Hie staple-growing
States depend upon diverting into the pursuits
of commerce, a largo portion of the
! capital, the character and the talent, which
'have been h lherto directed too exclusively
to agriculture and the learned professions?
It is the deliberate opinion of the
Committee that no change could lie made
in our pursuits, that would so largely contribute
to the public prosperity; and that
th osc public, spirited citzcns who shall
lake the lead in tli s new career ol useful
j enterprize, will deserve to be regarded as
public benelite tors.
! The prevailing habit of investing almost
the whole proceeds of our cotton
crops in land and negroes, has produced
a constant tendency toovcr production in
this great staple; and nothing but the extraordinary
increase of its consumption in
the great markets of the world, has prevented
us from experiencing the ruinous
j consequences V>f our mistaken policy. In
this view of the subject.every dollar that
shall l>c diverted from the production of
cotton, to some otlier profitable pursuit,
will be so much clear gain to the planter
and to the country.
It is a well established principle in po;
liUcal economy, that an excess <^f su^l)
beyond the efficient demand, diminishes
. the price of an article more than in pro
portion to the excess, and that a deficientcy
of supply increases the price in a corresponding
degree. For example, it is
!>elieved that if the present cotton crop
of the United States should be only
1,200,000 bales, it would produce a large
; | aggregate sum to the planters, than if it
should prove to be 1,500,000 bales, the
price being more enhanced than the quantity
would be diminished. It was upon
this principle that the Dutch East India
Company, actually burnt one-half of their
species, that they might obtain more for
the remaining half, than they could have
obtained for the whole. Let us pursue a
still wiser policy. Instead of burning our
surplus, let us direct the capita1 and industry
that produce it, to other profitable
pursuits, which will open new sources of
wealth, and at the same time increase the
value of those already in existence. In
c annexion with this view of the subject,
thn nnlifvnf raicin/* ?L:-L
J W111CU
the soil will produce, cannot be too strongly
recommended. By whatever specious
reasons a contrary policy may be countenanced,
experience proves them to be
fallacious. If every planter would raise his
own supplies of the various productions
of the soil, and of the animals which feed
upon those productions, it would tend
greatly to limit the excessive production
of our great staples, and increase at the
same time the independence and the income
of the agricultural class.
The committee will now proceed to examine,
a little in detail, the relative advantages
of the southern cities for the
business of foreign importation, compared
with those of the Northern cities. In the
first place, house rent is much higher in
the latter thun in the former, a very important
element in the calculation. In
the second place, freight is habitually
higher from Europe to the Northern than
to the Southern cities, for the plain reason
that ships joining to the South for cotton,
would have to come in ballast if they
were not freighted with merchandise. A!lthc
other elements that constitute the cost
of importation, are heiieVed to be as cheap
in the Southern as the Northern cities.
It is thu6 demonstrable that foreign merchandise
can he actually imported and
' sold in ihc former at cheaper rates than
nt tnc inner places. When to this we
add the expenses of transhipment at New
York or Philadelphia, the loss of interest
the freight and insurance t??lhe Southern
cities, and the expenses of landing ancl
storing there, it will be epparent that the
merchants of the South and South-west,
will find it greatly to their advantage to
their advantage, to make tlieir purchases
of foreign merchandise in our own cities,
in preference to New York or Philadelphia.
The same course of reasoning
will show thai our cotton can be exported
direi tly from our own seaports, with si- ^milar
advantages over the more circuitous
route of the Northern cities.
it seems, therefore, perfectly clear to
the committee, that our capitalists who
shall enter into the business of importing
foreign merchandise, cannot fail to realize
ample profits, and yet supply the merchants
of the interior oh terms more advantageous
than they can obtain from the
Northern importers. They have every
natural advantage in the competition, and
are invited bv cv*>rv ?UJ 1
. - --J j/UVJtC uuu
piivate to embark hi the business and
reap lite rich harvest that lies before them.
11 cannot be doubled that the merchants
of the interior will them a preference,
since, to the motives of interest, those
of patriotism will be superadded.
Among the measures which will most
effectually promote the great object which
has brought this Convention together,
none are more prominent, in the estimation
oi the committee, than the completion
of the great works of internal improvement,
by which the Southern Atlantic
cities are t<? be connected with the
Vail*) of the Mississippi. In aid of the
;..,1:....1.. . i - --* i -
mi vmu ll ci|Miai ann enterprizo engaged
in these works, it is believed that the patronage
of the Stales interested, might bo
wisely and beneficially bestowed. Their
completion Would greatly promote the
system of direct importations through our
own sea ports, and these importation*
would equally promote the completion of
the works in question. They are part*
j of one great system, and will mutually
sustain each otlie . If Georgia and South
Carolina, with that harmony and concert
of action which the inseparable identity
of their interest so strongly recommend*,
would bring their individual energies and
resources to the completion of those line*
of communication c< nneeting their atlan*
j tic cities with the navigable waters of
1 the West, the d.?y would not be distent
w lion our most ardent hopes and sanguine
anticipations would be realized.
The committee beg leave to suggest to
he Convention, another measure, which
to their opinion, would he eminently con .icive
to the great object we have in
\iew. One of the obstacles in the way
I' estatdishing a system of direct importations,
is the want of the requisite capt
