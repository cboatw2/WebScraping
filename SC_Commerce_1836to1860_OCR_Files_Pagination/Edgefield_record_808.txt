TIE COTTON CROP.
- We have been enabled toglean from our
exchanges the following information relative to
the situation of the Cotton Crop, from which,
our Planters wl1 be able to judge, whether it is
better to dispose of their crop at present pri
ces, or hold on for better.
The Mobile Journal of ,'onmcrcc, of tIe20th
-nlt., says: ' With regard to the estimate of
this season's crop, we,have until very recently
inclined to the behef that it would reach 1,900,
000 bales and n more From representations
made to us within the last three or four weeks
we believe it may probably fall somewhat low
er, thought the havy rains that have fallen with
an the last six weeks have not, we are inclined
to-think. destroyed altogether the cotton in the
fields, and with what may bi yet saved and
brought into n:arket. though inferior and ordi
nary in quality, there is sone plausibility in
counting upon a crop of from 1,800,000 to 1.
850,000 bales, Estimates, however are made
in New Orlean as low 1,600.000 bales.
' The Mobile len cantile Adcertiscr, ofthe 21st
ult., says:-Accounts come in very unfavora
bly from every section of the cotton growing
country of late. The rain has probably con
pleted the destruction of neatly all the cotton
in the fields and such as has not been housed.
There has been no weather favorable to gath
ering for the last six weeks, and the cottons
unpicked previous to the commencement of
the rains, we learn from all quarters, is either
beaten out of the bolls and into the earth, or
has commenced sprouting in the bolls that still
adhere to the stalk.
The Register of the 22d tilt. says:-Acconnts
from the country represent the rains as exces
sive, all the water courses being filled to over
flowing,'and the low lands inindated, to the
- serious damage of the residue of the cotton
crop remaining in the fields. Here. we have
had nearly a week of constant rain day and
aright; yesterday it cleared off with the pros
pect of fair weather.
The New Orleans Balletin of the same date
says:-The weather continues exceedingly in.
element; so much so, that in all the lower ct
ton region, picking must be entirely suspended,
and the remaining bolls greatly injured if not
destroyed, Business in the city is also much
retarded by the same cause.
The Tuscumbia North Alabamian says:
" If other portions of the growing donntry have
suffered from the long continued rains propor
tionably with this. the expectation of an abu.,
dant crop is not likely to be realized." From
the complexion of the accounts we have lately
received from the interior. we should not be
surprised if the receipts of this year at the port
of Mobile should fall short of 400,000 bales.
Mad Dogs. -Tnie Pendleton Messenger of
the 19th tilt. says : " Fur two weeks past, the
country has been in a state of alarm respecting
mad dogs. About that time a dog passed
through our village, which from certain cir
cumstances, was supposed to be mmad. c
started nine miles below this, and in his pro
gress, till lie was killed five miles ahov., was
- known to have bitten several dogs. and hogs.
A man was also hiten by hint on the little fin.
ger, which was taken of' about 2.1 hours after.
When we last heard from him,he had exhibited
no symptoms of Hy Iouno.ia, a- d ::"e e -v
ery probability that he will not :.e efferted by
it. A Cow and a hog in the neighbtorhood be
came diseased, and the symptumis were those
generally exhibited by rapid animals. Yet it
was not known that either of these;' ad been
h~itten. .ir that the dog alluded to, had been 'in
either of tihe places they were. We have hmeard
of one or two persons being bitten tm the.s
trict below us. buit do' not know how much
confidence is to be reposed in thme rumor."

YA.-Yam, or Dioscorca Bulbifera, C., is a
-native of Ceylon, whmence its culture has been
introduced into the WVest Indies, anid other
parts of America; it is divided into two varie
ties, k nown under thme iame of red and white;
from the color of their bulbous roots
.Yams flourish best onm pour soils; and retaini
their beautiful verdure till a late pteriod in tho
year; hence they are said to ameliorate the
grounid nearly as mumchi as a crop of turnips.
Being propagated by setting the eyes, their
culture cormespmnds with that of potatoes, amnd
like these roots. Yams ofteni prove an escellenit
preparatory crop for wheat. Farther, they
mre very productive; so that, thme red variety
yields, in general, 12 tons per acre: thme white
-isort is less fruiitful; hut, being more delicate,
it is chiefly raised for the table, in thme W~est
Indies.
The culture of these bulbour roots in Britain
is, at present, we understand, confined to the
counties of Mid-Lothmin, and Stirling; where
they are given to cows, thme milk of which is
thsconsiderably increased, without affecting
its quality or flavor.
Asan article of food,the Yam possesses sim
ilar properties with the potatoe, excepting that
- 'is less mealy; in a raw state, it is vicions;
bbiwhen roasted, this bulbous root is equally
wvhaebame and nourishing, so that the inhabi
thuts of tlih..yotst Indies pnrefer it even to bread.
valnable than potatoes; because the former
are much lighter, and more easily digested
when first Tug out of .the ground, then dried
in the sun, and ptlverised from humidity, in
casks full of dry sand, they may be kept for
several years, uninjured by frost. and without
losing any parts of their nntritive quality.
These beneficial roots may'also be pulled, de
prived of their moisture by pressure. and dried
it the same manner as Mr. Millington directs
potatoes to be preserved, (see vol. v. page 326.)
In this manner, Yams may be packed in casks,
like flour, and imported in a perfectly sound
state, from the WVest Indies; when grated, and
mixed with wheat or barley flour, they may
be formed into a light and salubrious bread,
Nor are the% less nourishing, when converted
into pottage. or pudding, with the addition of
milk. Thus Mr. R. Pearson (Annals of Agri.
cuture, vol. xxxv.) informs ns that the meal,
obtained from the boiled or grated roots, when
beaten up with milk and eggs, without any
flour, yielded a firm and welt flavored dish,
which would with difliculty be distinguished
from a common batter pudding. By this treat
ment, the Yams are divested oftheir saccharine
taste. which renders them at first disagreeable
to some persons; though sur.h property, is, on
the whole, of considerable use; as it saves the
expense of sugar L.'
Allered Bile.-Our attention was yes
terday called to another case of deception
in a batik bill, which it is proper to notice
in order to prevent fraud. A twenty dol
lar.bill was sent to a metcantile house in
this city, purporting to be of the Commer
cial Bank of Columbia, but on examina
tion proves to he an old plate of the Com
mercial Bank of Macon, long since extinct
the words "Georgia" and "Macon" are
extracted by some chemical process, and
"South Carolina" and "Columbia" inser
ted in their place. The hill is dated 20th
May. 1841. and signed A. Blanding, Pres
ident, and J. Ewart, Cashier. The for
mer gentleman was once President of the
Columbia Bank but departed this life;
much lamented, some time previous to the
above date, and while occupying the sta
tion of President of the South Western
Rail Road Bank, -and the latter named
never occupied the station of Cashier.
The plate is so difl'erent from those in cir
eulrtion that detection will be easy with
aiv one who pays attention.-Charleston

upon examination, found that the fasten

Vickers, the contractor, immediately went
in pursuit of the mising mail,'and found.
in about a mile of Double Wells, some
forty letters all broken open and rifled of

His loss is a'out seven thousantd dollars,

Extremes in Commerce are like extremes
in every other department of human af
fairs. An average condition of the supply
of any article of trade of general use and
whose value regulates that of many others
of daily consumption and commerce, pro
duces, a medium stare of prices the most
conductive to general prosperity. Let us
apply this general remark to the present
condition of the cotton market. We can
not but perceive that while an average
crop was expected there was nothing to
excite speculation. With the leading.
provocative to mercantile excitement the
great abundance of money, all was quiet
ness and tranquility. But this expecta
tion became changed. A defciency, to
an unascertained extent, succeeded this
anticipation. The speculative feeling has
been gradually growing stronger as this
assurance of a deficiency became con
firmed, until speculation begins now to
assume the features ofalarmn--say alarm,
for nothing could be more effectu'al in ar
resting the return of the country to confi
dence and prosperity than a speculative
excitement in the article of cotton, the
great regulator of o:her values,
It is to be perceived that the market is
not govr-rned as usual by a natural, but
by an -tificial state of supply and de
mand, ' ed by the comparative abun
dunce of money on this side of the Atlan
tic. The consumption and wants of the
European market have ceased, for the mo
ment. to regulate the value on this side.
Capitalists have consequently the power
of holding over in the American markets
to the great temporary injury of a sound
and wholesome condition of trade. We
say temporary injury, for the reaction
cannot be delayed longer than a shipment
of specie, caused by the retention of Cot
ton on this side of the water and the con
sequent scarcity of lills drawn against it
shall rectify the eyil. The Spring impor
tations from Europe compared with 1842
and '43, will be large, and the coin now
accumnlared in our banks, which should
be diffused over the interior, to supply
the void caused by the withdrawal of pa
per money, may and will go back in a
large stream to Europe. Any considera
ble movement of specie to rectify a ba
lance of trade. produced by artificial scar
city, is a great evil, and however some
parties may appear to benefit by this scar
city, in theenbanced price of the exports,
the country at large suffer. injury in all
its other business relations. In the present
condition of things a reflux of the current
by which any large portion of the preci
ous metals shall he driven back to Eu
rope, must retard the restoration of con
fidence with a healthy state of trade.
The channels of domestic and internal
commerce want replenishing with a spe
cie currency that will invigorate it. The
abundant crops of the present year would
enable those parts of the Union which
have been deprived of their bonk to snp
ply the equivalent for s eeie in the pro
ducts of their industry. But if fictitious
values send the stream of hard money in
an opposite direction to that which nati
ral causes would lead it to take, every
well wisher to the regularity of trade will
have cause to regret the circumstances by
which such a forced condition things is
produced.

MENRY CLAY AND THE ANTIMA
SONS.
This desperate gambler having placed
his stakes for the Presidency in the "po
litical wheel of fortune," on the wh/ite and
black. Slavery and Abolition, and having
risked on the cotunter columns of a Pro
tective Tariff and Free Trade ; has, to
take "all the chances," now laid heavily
on double zero, sacrificing to ttnchiastencd
amnltition his oldest atnd best friends, on the
altar of Ant inasonry. There is one fact
stared tby Mr. Clay wvhichn will somewhat

that is, his -'great repugnance to appear

testimony that all the objects of the Itusti

wit h them, were "charitable and benevo

Clay has but little or no taste? Further
to ingratiate ~himself with this fanatical
and proscriptive band, he gives them no

Gambling in Charleston-I f the followv
ing Ire true-it ought to be wvidely
known:
We have it from the most unquestionable
authority that a youtng man out of employ
merit, poor, but very respectably connec
ted, and having a large circle ofacquain
tances, both itt the city' and on thne neigh
boring islands, was olfered a salary of
8600 a year, together with his'board at
ny otel whIrch he migaht selectndw his
tailors bill paid, provided he would act as
a decoy to:one ofithe Gambling Estaplish
ments in the city. But as he declined the
temptinglhait; it is very probable some oth
er person with less scrupiesofconsecieuce
and moral prineples to oprcome, has sold
himself to the same piractiral gang. And
many a green. one,--a planter,--or the son
of a planter,-a merchar.t, or the clerk of
a merchant,---may be caught in the mesh
es thus laid for their feet.-We also learn
from the same source, that similar estab
lishments, are numerous; and they are fre
quented by persons who are suspected of
hnaving any gambling propensities. One of
these 'las lately caught, and under the ex
citement of stimulating drink, played deep
er than liis purse, and for the deficit gave
his note for $400. When he had fairly
come to himself, -he resolved that he would
not pay the note, and returned to the es
tablishment, where he announced the res
olutton.---\Whereupon the noto was at once
produced, and torn up before him ; and he
warned never again to appear in the estab
lishment. The effect was wonderful.
Poor man he had forfeited his honour! The
Gamblers, by profession, were themselves,
far superior to him in nobleness of soul,
and he was thus thrown into that condi
tion which was bordering upon lunacy;
and it was with difficulty be could be pre
vented from laying violent hands upon
himself. The money ofcourse, was paid,
though his honest creditors, or his family
may have been sulil'era.
We give these incidents as war-ings.
And as this city is becoming more and
more the rendezvous of Gamblers, it i.
quite time that some decided stand should
be taken to abate the nuisance.-The num-'
her of them is variously estimated at from
one hundred to three hundred; and including
all that are in there employ, decoys, sha
vers, and th like.-the last estimate is
not perhaps any too large.-Charleston

A VoUsTA, Dec. 2S.
Remarks.-We observe by the western pa
pers that the rains continue to flood the cotton
growing region. This, of course. has given
strength to the opinion, that the present wvill be
a greatly dimmnished ciop. Indeed many of
the speenlations which came to us front the
west. argue the probability that the crop will
not exceed 1,600,0010 hales. The facts upotn
which this conclusion is founded are meagre
atid questionable, and we 'cannot hesitate to
prononnce the opinmon dangeroUs; jnst as much
so as the opposite one, that the crop will reach
2,000,000 hales. It cannot he pretended that
either of them' arc formed wvith an unbissed
t..,tument.
The moderate of both parties in this country,
appear to agree in the amount of 1,800,000
bales, the nearest airoximation. Admitting,
then, that the crop w not exceed this amount,
are we certain of results which would
spring from such a diminished crop. Hove we
any reason, with such a state orthe case, to ex
pect an advance upon present.prices. It murt
he apparent to all, that even the, existing de
mand is specnlative in, its character. It may.
be more rational than the feverish excitement
which imprudence has so often engeidered.
It may be better founded in well ascertained
facts than the speculations which have former
ly proven so disastrous: yet. notwithstanding,
it must be admitted that it has no better ascer
tained' data than the probable- extent of the
crop, and the probable amount ofconsumption.
We learn that in Liverpool the impression pre
vailed, that the crop would not exceed 1,800,
000 bales; but we heard of no material ad.
vance, which speenlation would certainly have
produced, if it had been warranted by a proba
ble consumptive demand. They anticipated,
on the contrary, a fine export trade in the- .arti
cle, from the fact that prices are higher here
than there. We would not say that present
prices in America will. not be sustained; for
that would also be speculative ; but we will not
refrain from repeating our advice to purchasers
and holders, of cautiotsness and moderation.
Colton.-Tho receipts during the week have
been 'noderate, and principally by Rail Road.
The sales have been limited, owing to the fact
that very little Cotton has been offering. The
advices per the Hibernia has had, no percepti
ble influence upon the market; the impiove
ients of last week having been well sustained,
and holders continuing firm in their demands.
We qnte the extremes of the market at from
71 to 9e. A choice lot would bring something
over the above rate.-Constitutionalist.
CowuanuA, Dec.28.
Colton.-There is but little coming in, as
usual during the oChristmas holidays. and of
conrse but little doing in the article. The late
Liverpool acounts by the Hibernia have pro
duced no change in this market, as yet, and
whether they will do so, will depend on the ad.
vices to be received of their effect on the
Northern markets. There had been previously
a slight advance on our quotations of Wed
nesdiy last, and the current rates may now be
quoted at 74 a 9 cents, extremes. We under
stand that 94 Bents were offered for several
liidred hales yesterday. and refused ; and that
for one lot us nigh as 10 cents were offered.
