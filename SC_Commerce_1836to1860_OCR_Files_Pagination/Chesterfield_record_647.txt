was takon tip in Committee of the whole.
I The stale of tho question was as follows:
Mr. llalsted, from the Cnnimitte on
Elections, had moved lo suspend tho hill*
by adding the following as section 2:
And be it further enacted, That each
State shall be divided, bv the Legislature
thereof, into as many districts, composed
of contiguous territory, as shall he equal
to tho number of Representatives to
which said State rnav be entitjed in thflL
House of Representatives of the Congress
of the United States, and that each of tho
said districts shall elect one Representative.
To which amendment Mr. Campbell,
of South Ofirolini, had moved the following
amendment:
That in every case where a State is entitled
to moro than one Representative,
the number to which rnch State shalt be
entitled under this apportionment shall
he elected by MHtneta composed of con1
tiguous territory equal in number to tho

Various objection* wore made to the
amendment by different members on different
ground*.
Mr. Underweod took the ground that
the amendment was not in order became
it proposed to Congress to do that which
it had no constitutional power to do. vix.
direct the State Legislatures how to act
in tho mutter of Slato Elections to Congress.
Mr. HiMed replied, and quoted the
Constitution, which declares that Congress
had power to appoint the time, place,
and manner of holding State elections.
Mr. Colquit danicd tho const.tuMonalitv
of such r law as tho amendment proposed,
and inquired if a Stato should re'
fuse to obey, how it was going to bo enforced?
He hoped tho gentleman would
consent to withdraw the amendment.
Mr. Halsttid sail ha cnull not do so
having been ordered to move it.
Mr. Colquit than said ho should move
as an amendment that the State of Georgia
be expected from the operation of the
law. [A laugh.]
Mr. Campbell, of South Carolina, supported
the amendment, and contended
that in this, thn popular branch of tho
Legislature, the true principle of the Constitution
was, that minorities as well as

He had one? doubted the constitutionality
of the amendment, hut. on full examination,
hts doubts had been removed, the
conatitutienarohjection was wholly tech
nieal.
Mr. Tillinghut thought the objection
urged by Mr. Onderwood strong, and th*
gentleman fro n South Carolina secmo*
to feel its force. The? Constitution re
served to the States tho right to r?g ilatc
the time, place, and manner.of State e
lections just as they pleased, until Con
gre.ss" should take up tho .subjoct and aei
upon it i Congress had not yet done thi<;
and tillthen.it had no right todirect the
States how to act in the matter. The a.
mendment did not legislate, but called
on tho States to legislate, which was quite
another thing.
Mr. Stanly replied to some of the
points nftho constitutional argument o
those who had opposed the amendment
insisting that Congress w.u not obliged l<
exercise at once nil the powers committee
to 't by the Constitution in relation to th<
regulations of the time, place, and man
ner of holding elections in the Stases: i
might exert a part and reserve a part, a
pleasure, as it constantly had done in re
ference to other subjects where if* power.were
more than one. Thus it had power
to regulate commerce with foreign na
lions and between the States and wit!the
Indian tribes: rould it not reguUt*
foreign commerce unless it regulated, by
the same act. our commerce with the In
di.n tribes? Mr. 3. went into several ;f
lustrations to confirm this postion, doriv
; ed from the ordinary practice of the Gov
ernment. It had acted for a long peritv
; on naturalization, vet not an bankruptcy
hoth being included in the same chuseo
the Constitution: so it might erect a for1
and do nothing in relation to dock-yards
though the power ov.v hoth was given a
/ the same time. This question was, hap
pilv, free from all connexion with pari}
politic*. fie advertod to the ease witl"
which a few of the larger State*, by adop
ting the general ticket plan, might con

?d the expediency of preventing this by
districting all the Stitea. Ho was *ur<

(Mr. Under wood) should have spoken *r
lightly of the danger of Executive patron
age ineorrupting the House: if that was r
danger to ho sneered at. then the wholt
body of the complaints of the Whig part;,
far years had been directed against hum
hug. and the replies of their opponent*
were as great a humbug as tho complaint
Ha hoped the amendment would prevail
as ho wasconfidont the general adoptior
of the district system would bo of Ihi
great' st public advantage.
Mr. (ioggin invited the attention o

tse power of Congress to regulate thr
time, place, and manner of State elections

and pure character of the deceased pa.
triot, and his authority on all constitution,

port of the debates in the Convention a
speech of Mr. M. at consul, rahle length.
Mr. G. admitted that in strictness Con.
gress did posses* tho power to district the
States, hut protected against its exercise
as a most odious use of authority Hn
appealed to the committee not to disturb
a state of things which hah existed sn
long. The power was intended only to
he used in the last resort, in case the
States should neglect or refine tonct, in
order that the wheels of the General
Government might not slop. Tne amendment
was wholly unexpected, and its he.
ing thils suddenly sprung upon the Mouse
excited great surpriso. Mr. G. had no objection
to tho district system in itself: he
preferred it; he even abhorred the mode
of elorting by general ticket; but he protested
against Congressional action on the
P . .
subject, because it might hereafter fix the
general ticket system on all the States;
for if Congress could enjoin the one they
could the other.
Mr. Arnold claimed tho floor; but, after
