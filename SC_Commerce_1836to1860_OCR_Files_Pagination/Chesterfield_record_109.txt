j knowing, not merely where, but how the;
j are to eat before night. In my wander
j ings about the metropolis, I have of.ei
i seen the wretched diners. I do not pas
! them by without observation. Believing
| as 1 do, that all revolutions in Europ
. should be for ameliorating the conditio!
1 not onlv of the middle, but also of the low
i or, classes, I wish to know what, for thes<
j latter, the revolutions in France have done

' and sinTering from miserable diet, take:

Tiie lowest forms of Parisian eating ma*
! he found in cerium streets of the Fau
| bourghs. and in t'10 market places. Visi
; the Mi'.rchc des Innoeeiis at any hour o
I the day. You will see around its fountair
; some score of oM women, couched, in th(
j open air, by the side of the:r, little tin cook
I ing apparatus. Around each arc a dozer
! men, and children, some standing, som<
! sitting, and ail devouring the bowls o
steaming, particolored soup, which liavc
just, for eight iiards or two sous each, bei i
adlcd forth. Tne disli.'s smell of garlic
and judging from signs in faces, cannot b:
over rclishaUe. Tne multifarious igredients
that surround tire compounders of this
broth :
44 The eyes of newt, and toes of lrog,
The lizard's legs and owlet's wings "
remind you of that of that "gruel thick an<i
slab." manufactured by the witches tti
Macbeth. This is hut the type in many
other scenes, and thus baukuet thousands
of the Parisians.
Walk in'o the large meat market. At
one corner are half a dozen stalls. In each
sits a mutton complexioned woman.?
A found her are twenty wiiitc platters, heap,
od up wiih second hand, and third, and
even fourth hand remnants. They are
remnants lrotn the great Restaurants.?
And now here conies a ragged man, bearing
upon his shoulders, a dirty bag.?
Bargaining lor its contents with the woman
of a stall, he outpoors a bushel of half
moated bones, and half mounched crusts of
bread. The heap looks repulsive enough,
and vou pronounce it unnourishable and
unpalatable. Your dog merely smells at
it, as he passes by. And yet on such forbidden
food, are nourished thousands of the
Parisians. Here are some sad facts, about
...I \ 1 .t.?
which your guunu oiiu ui mc ivochct, putting
ofluxurv iii Parisian banquets, never
dreams. There arc wide contrasts in Pa.
l is, and none more wide than those in eating.
The scenes just visi'ed have some
mournful interest. Amidst them comrncnced
that cry lor bread in tiie former
revoiirion, that cry which was not silenced
till tire Royal Family were dragged, by
a starving mukitu le, from the palace a;
Versailles to their prison in the Tuileries.
The next highest form of Parisian eating
may be found at the Magazim dc Via.
Of these establishments, there are seven
thousand in the capital. Tncy are the
nearest approach, I have here seen to the
grog-shops ot toe Laited Stales, and the
gin palaces of England. They may bo
seen in every quarter of Paris, and chiefly
in Faubourg St. Autoinc. Look into one
of them, if you would know, among other
things, how a Frenchman behaves when in
liis cu. 9 At the entrance may generally
be iuhalt d the flavors of marrow roasting.
Within is a female, well-dressed, and seated
behind a counter, whereon stand queerly
fashioned bottles, glasses and flasks. She
sells bread at the price fixed, for every
fifteen days, by the authorities, wine at G

occasional cheese, are conveyed infc a ;
small back apartment, containing several :
cloth covered tables, to be enjoyed. The ;
conversation, and manners of those apart- j
m;;nts, vou will lind abundantly in someno
veis of Paul de Koek. Good bread, |
good cheese, and wine at six sous the liot- !
tic. make tjo unimportant portion of the j
subsistence of multitudes of Parisian ope- j
ratives. It is just one step above t!ie diet {
of the classes just mentioned, and just one ;
step below that of Restaurants, whose uiti-1
ners co>t sixteen sous. A Restaurant,
of sixteen sous !!?nay of fifteen, if you j
at once purchase fifteen tickets, and of
fourteen, if you forswear wine. The Rocher
de Cancale is the highest Restaurant

are those of eighteen, twenty,
twenty-three, twenty-eight, thirty.two.
and finally of forty sous. Passing beyond
the forty sous dinners, you sail out thro'
a widening channel, into a broad ocean ol

currents so engulph and collapse the purse
that yen almost wish your appetite anchored

Restaurant of sixteen sons, though
' entertaining its customers with rather questionable
soups, yet serves itself with pret'
ty pompous titles. For instance, it in
' scribes over its door, An Bon Potage, or
^ A La Renommcc dc Bids dc Moulon.?
Sometimes it calls itself, Lc Petit T cry,
sometimes the Restaurants nc PUnivers.
j < '
^ and then agatn Lc Petit Rocher. An establishment
having lately assumed this
3 o *
latter designation, was therefor prosecuted
by the proprietor of the veritable Rocher
dc Caocale. He deemed the assumption
unwarrantable, and calculated to jeopardise,
and depreciate tbe reputation of bis
famed resort. The c >mp!aint was, by
r a criminal tribunal, pronounced well ba3
scd, and .the title of Lc Petit Rocher, join'

1 The sixteen sous Kcstauant generally
s announces a saloon "superb et tnaguifique,"
with one hundred or more covers. Its napkins
are always wonderfully clean, and its
y plates of rarest workmanship. The ser
vice is most quick dtvpatch; and its adi
verasemcnt wiuningly says, "on-y-lit le
s journal." For sixteen sous, it will give
you tins dinner; to wit:?a soup, two dishes
e of incut very strong, (tres forts) and gamn
ished with vegetables selected from thecaste
by yourself: a carafou, or little decanter ot
c gooJ Macon, bread always a discretion, a
very tine (tres beau) dessert, corresponding
r to the scaaon, or a petit ccrrc of brandy.?
i The generous feature about their b.li of
C arc is evidently the pain a discretion. At
every other Restaurant, you must pay f>
'? sous for each advli.ional roil Hence d)
you see the habitue of the sixteen sous es ?
tablishrnent nibbing away at roil after roll
s until he has managed to secure an extraordinary
quantity of nourishment for his mo '
ney. In i s public is comprehended a very

- tachoud individual, whom in ti e afternoon
i you had admired for most exquisite bearing
' among the promenaders in the gardens of

i sous Restaurant, as at the Grand vatel, a:id
t consequently even there may you often
' hear drawled forth ar.stocra'ical reproach
es of "{fuel diner, garcon, quel execrable
? uinerl''
I hardly think it worth uhi'e to tarry
much, here 01 there, as we journey onwards,
uj) and through tiiu thirty two sous,, and
I Restaurants, until we arrive at those of forty,
i They unquestionably ddler from each oth'
er. There is a difference, for instance, be.
; tween tho Restaurant of twen y and flat
of twenty-two sous. Rut the distinction is
dedicate, and seldom appreciable save by die
garcon, and the practised habitue. They
ouch have their single soup, then* two dishes
moat, their carafon of wine, their bread
a dcscretion, and their desert. They each,
moreover, have their peculiar clicntelle, or
public. It is not until you get up to the
thirty-two sous Resturant, that the prospect
begins to widen, and yon find yourself entitled
to three dishes of mcr, and a half
Lottie of Macon, or ChuLUs. Gaucher
keeps a very good Restnuran of this description
behind the Palais Royal, lie
gives you one dinner for thirty-two sous,
or fifteen dinners for twenty two and a half
francs- I he dishes at Gauchcr's are thoroughly
cooked; the lady at the counter has
big white hands, and thj gnreons move
about with the rapidity of lightening. If!
you know how to order you may there get
along very well. Gancher's urgentirre,j
however, is altogether too second hand.? j
'The forks have iheir prongs half eaten up j
by use. The spoons are extremely worn, j
and die knives look lean and dangerous.? j
The company at Gauchcr's comes under j
the head of shabbily genteel. I have be-'
fore me a caricature of this establishment. |

bowl of soup, a small shoe. Calling the j
garcon, they reproach him, i.ot for the
presence of the snoc, but for the absence of
the soup which that shoo displaced. Gauche
r's is patronized chiefly by those gentlemen,
who are little? anxious about the
distinction between a era and a rabit.
Leaving Guucher's we commence at (
once to the Restaurans of forty sous. There j
are half a dozon in the Palais Royal. On
the western side, Fohet's is :o be spoken j
of, and on the eastern, Yen's and Rich-j
ard's. At FolleiYyo'i may meet rcspec-!
table looking refuges; Italian, Spanish]
and Polish. At Richard's presides a dame

I have yet seen in similar establishments.,
These Festauranis, however, lack in c-^-1
gethcr too near the saloon, so ttint its1
tunics reek tiiro*if>n your atmosphere. At j
Richards and \ ons. ti:e lloors tail in cleanliness,
and t!ie garrons move over them
in heavy shoes, instead of noiseless pumps.
At all oflheni, moreover, the conversation j
is quite too loud;?likewise, there is
much blowing cf noses;?also, they da ;

containing less exceptionable features than ;
the Colbert, in the Gallery Colbert. The j

i EXTRACT FROM GOVERNOR DUNCAN'S MES|
I
| AGE, TO THE LEGISLATURE OF IILINOIS.
" In my message at the opening of the |
II ist session, it was my happiness to con
i'gratulule you on the prosperity then so j
j eminently enjoyed by every portion of our i
j beloved country ; and from mv inmost
i . jr i i .u :
i Mean, uiu i rejuiuu iu sue me muusuiouf ,
i citizen every where reap the rich rewards !
J of his labor. And although, even then, 1
i was not without strong apprehensions of an
| oarly reverse, I am confident no human j
r forecast could have anticipated so sudden
| a calamity as has been brought upon the ,
country by the action of the Federal (Jo- j
> vcrmcnt upon its currency. At the time j
1 the President of the United States assumed
; til j responsibility of ordering the public mo- j
ney to be removed from their legal deposite ,
| m the Bank of the United States, for the j
purpose, as he avowed, of preventing the [
re-char:cr of that institution by Congress, j
! there never was a sounder currency or a i
! more liealthv state of things in anv Govern-1
j ment in the world. To tfleet this great j
, object, namely, that of destroying the lrni. i
j ted States Bank, rival institutions were to j
! be created : and it will be remembered that j
immediately after the removal of the de- j
j poshes, the Government par y commenced i
! establishing State Banks, whilst State Le- ,
1 gislaturcs, deluded by the fallacious pro- j
; mise of advantages 10 be derived from the j
i deposites to be made in these institutions,:
I which were to be fiscal agents of Govern
j ment, readily fell into the measure. As j
J might have been expected, hundreds of new i
i banks instantly sprung up, their enormous
; issues of irredeemable paper afforded the in-;
j ducemcn! of universal extravagant specu{lation,
and gave us what all must now r- ;
j gard as a depraved and worthless curren- j
jcy.
j "Before the public were aware of the j
j ruin which this wild scheme portended, the ,
J Executive, and a portion of its party, see- |
I ing their error, it would seem, endeavored .
Jo escape its consequences bv amusing the
i people with the absurd and impracticable j
' project of an exclusive hard money currcn- j
i cv. I say absurd, for us well m'ght the |
j the Executive of the United States expect j
1 to compel the citizens of the Great Valley j
j to abandon the use of the steamboats and j
| resume the flat bo'tom and barge in the ,
' navigation of its thousand streams and riv- j
| ers, as to force thetn to give up a sound :
j paper currency, at ali times convertible i
, in:o specie, with all its adaptetlness to the J
purposes of the commerce and business of J
| the country. Before such a scheme can j
j be prosecuted to the results they promised, j
j the intelligence, commerce, liberties, and
j boundaries of all these United States must j
' be obliterated, and the people yield to the j
j stubborn will and rule of a despot. These !
! Experiments, as they have been styled by
i their authors, may, and 1 believe, have had
j their political eflirt; but they have also 1
J had their efUct upon the country acknowl- j
: edged to be full of resources, distinguished
j for its intelligence, is enterprise, and won
| dcrful prosperity, in reducing it to an almost j
; universal bankruptcy ; in prostrating alike j
j its business, its energies, and conMdence. ' J
MIL U EBSTER AT PEORIA
I The Peoria (Illinois) R-gistcr of the 01th ul- j

! speech in that place on the 01st. Nearly the |
' whole town and neitrhborhood had assemble 1 at 1
I ? ~ o
! the Court Hons'.*, cirJ Mr. W. spoke moro than '
| na hour.
i I was oppose:! to all the measures of
i the lute administration, having reference
, to the regulaion of tin currency, from the j
i word 'go.' Tfie la to President of the U. !,
States, a man of high purpose, of strong :
| character, and a gallant and successful j
soldier, whose honest intentions I have
never questioned, said in 183*2, he could
submit a plan by which the monied con.
corns of the government would be much j1
better conducted and carried on. From j (
that time the 'experiment' has beonlin pro- i'
gross, and what does it prove? Why, that
groat a soldier as he was, he was mistaken
in his powers as a financier, and that the j
country is now in a coudtiion far worse than
s\fthgt HonL- (iftlio 1
HlOlwuu ui i??o L/uua vi tuv v j
Suites, he has given us innumerable state j
banks,as depositories of the public treas-.,
ure, who act in no concert save the agree- !,
ment stimultaneously to become banckrupt.
[A laugh.] Wiieiher they will be as un- '
animous to resume specie payments remains }
i to be seen.
The government is the great receiver;.
and disburser of the money of ilu: country, J
and it gives character to ti e currency. Its \
effect on the currency is similar to the j'
flowing of your rivers. Your Illinois and \
Upper Mississippi flow on, till the mighty \ s
Missouri wi:!i i*s volume of water pours in ! j
and gives to all i's owujcharacter and force, i
absorbing in its course the Wabash, the <
Ohio, and ihc others that em- 'v into it, while ;
i? ' i* v y v, -jv V" '*
Thus there must be a coi.tr./fling power to | \
give force ami ctTicacv to the various | ci
stale banking institutions in our govern- i c
niont. Such an one was the Hank of the j e
United S;atu>, ami i! the government re. ; t
jects it. it must find out a better wav. On c
this subject a little experience is worth more ' n
than a financial argument. ! i
For foriv years while we had a national ! a
hank, we had the best currency on earth. ' f
Does any man hero want a better one? For j s
forty years, I repeat, out of forty eight, since (
the organization of our government. What j t
have these S years been? Here is one of j v
them, Anno Domini 1837. (A laugh) 1812, j r
'13 and '1-1, were three more of thein.
* sic * *
I hold in utter contempt the understand, j \
ingofmenwho apprehended danger hom ;
a national bank guardod by proper res'ric- j
(ions upon its charter. Wn t did they 11
do who opposed i s recharter, when they i i
succeeded in destroying the last? They i
went homo and crea'ed now banks to the i
the amount of ten times its capita!. * * .
Gondemen you know nothing here of;
hard times, you cannot know them. Go j
to the commercial cities, where men with

a work which has just made its appearance
in Paris, the Memoirs of Gen. La Fay- \
ette, published by his family. They ap- j
pear as part of an introduction by tire j
venerable patriot, and give bis reasons for
not giving to the world, during his life, a j
detailed account of the political events in
which lie played so conspicuous and important
a part:?A. \. Slur.
" When, in mv youth, I devoted myself |
to th; cause of freedom, and I saw no <
bounds to the career which lay open to me, i
(thought it sufficient for my destiny and j
my glory to march unceasingly onward, j
and leave to others the care of collecting !
the rcminiscensos and the fruits of my lab

" It wa;oa!y after fifteen years of con- i
slant good fortune that whilst contending :
in full ctnlidence of success against the
coalition of kings and the arisiocraey of
Europe, I was overthrown by the excesses
of French Jacobinism. My person was i
then given up to the violence of my natural <
enemies, and my reputation to tin calum- I
nics of pretended patriots ; who had viola- i
ted their oaths, and proved false to the most i
solemn engagements. i
" It is well known that the restraints to I <
which I was subjected during live years of t
imprisonment, were not favorable to litera- j
ry efforts; and when, af.er my liberation, t
I was advised to write my defence, I was t
detcrcd from the task by disgust at the me- \
moirs and notices with which so many !
persons have abused the ears of the pub- j t
lie. Besides, events had spoken for us:'c
the accusers and their accusations had,'t
in many instances, perished together. * i:
" Immediately on my return to France,; i
my friends called for my memoirs. I found s
sufficient excise for refusing them in my v
repugnance to deal with Jacobin leaders, j,
who became sharers in my proscription; !
with the Giroudists, who had died in de- I
fending those principles which they have j
combatted and persecu ed in me; with the
King and Queen, whose deplorable fate j c
permitted me no other feeling than satisfac-1<J
tion on account of some services I had s
been able to render them; ar.d wi.h roy- j s'
alists, conquered, dispirited, and now com- i v
polled to submit to harsh and arbitrary J w
measures. I might add that, happy in the j ^
retreat of my family, and in the midst of Q'
rural pleasures, I have not a moment to j11
spare from these domestic enjoyments. | c
" But as I am still urged, even here, by j "
the same entreaties, I have, in order to *
satisfy my friends, consented to arrange j P
the papers which remain, to collect docu- j
merits already published, and to append ( u
:iotes to the collection, wliic'.i may furnish j
o my children and others some ma'crials j "

ki As for me, I confess that my iudilfer- j c
?iice on this subject springs from the con- j a
idence I fe d that liberty will finally estab- i
ish itself in the old world as in the new ;
md that then the history of our re volutions ' ivill
do impartial' justice, and show every j fl
^artv, in its true light." 0

CARRYING WEAPONS
Late occurrences in our village, justifv,
is in making some remarks upon this barParous
practice of carrying arms in com)any.
Wo fear that an increased inter;ourse
with the Mississippi country has had
in effect to vitiate public taste and lower the
standard of morality in this particular. Wo
;an remember very well when any one who
tame into a peaceful company with a dirk
pr pistol peeping out of his bosom was regarded
with kind of horror: now nothing is
note common. We know of several respectable
and well bred young m?n, who \
scarcely ever had a quarrel, and who from
he known placidity of their temper, will
iardly ever have an enemy, who, neverli/v'i

A Sixth Continent.?An extraordinary
phenomenon, presented in the Southern
ocear, may rendi r our settlements in New
Si nil Wales of still more eminent importance.
A sixth Continent is in tlie very
act of growth before our eyes! The Pacific
is spotted with islands, through the immense
spice of nearly fifty degrees of
longitude, and t:s many of latitude. Every
one of these islands seems to be merely

The union of a few of these masses of

the waves; and from the moment that
