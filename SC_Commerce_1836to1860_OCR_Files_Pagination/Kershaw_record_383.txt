SATURDAY MORNING, MAY 30,1840.
COCOONS.
We have left, for inspection, at this office, one do
zen selected Cocoons, from a stock of worms reared
here this season?the whole weighing 21 dwts. 18 grs.;
one of which weighs 53 grs. The worms which
producod these Cocoons were remarkably healthy;
were purchased for, and believed to be, the "two
crop white,"
A few thousand of the eggs can be had by applica.
t ion at this office.
THE RIVER.
The Watcroc at the moment our paper is going to
press, is highor than it has been known for a number of
years, and wo learn was still rising. All the river plantations
not protected by embankments, are of course,
under water, and great fears are entertained, that even
those thus protected, may share the fate oftho others,
from the immense weight of water pressing against the
embankments. The loss to our river planters must
be very heavy; their crops, which as it were, but yesterday,
promised a rich return, is suddenly destroj'cd.
Without a recurrence, however, of such a misfortune,
they will yet be able to make an abundant crop of
corn. f
TO CORRESPONDENTS.
' Quietus," " P." and " Clio" are unavoidaly crowded
out this week. Their place is supplied with a
very interesting specimen of Congressional literature.
" Gulielmus" is under consideration.
"Joe Bachelor" must excuse us?there is more
poetry in the married life than he has yet dreamed of.
OT Wo ask the attention of our citizens to the
communication of Camdex, on the subject of a public
meeting for the purpose of expressing our confidence
in the present Administration, and of embodying
public sentiment in its favor. Wc have regretted,
in common with many others, that some expression
* of the feelings of this District, on the subject, was
#!i<a moahnrr nf u'lnMi Pfil T?ir*ua n nenv
was nominated for Governor. We trust, however,
that some favorable opportunity will be taken to supply
this omission.
NATIONAL BANKRUPT LAW.
This subject is now fairly before the United States
Senate, and from the decided interest manifested by
* the debatants, we should judge with considerable
prospect of a favorable issue. We are led to this
conclusion, from the fact, that so far, the discussion
seems to be between a voluntary and compulsory
Bankrupt Law, all, or nearly all, apparently con.
curring in the propriety of either one or the other.
For our own part, we shall be pleased to see either
plan adopted, as any system, having universal application
throughout our whole country, will be preferable
to the present discordant and ill digosted mass
of State laws 011 this subject. Wo think though,
aL.t is. :n 1 JI? 1 1 <1..* 1 ru- A...
uiui IL wui iiaxuij uu uuuLueu, max auwcvw ior uui
sympathies may carry us, in our legislation, for the
relief of unfortuatc but honest debtors, that the
rights of creditors should not be entirely overlooked,
but that they should have their legitimate and ap- !
propriate influence; in other words, that laws should
be made as far as it is possible to do so, to protect
both. It is an old saying, that " it is a bad rule that
dont work both ways." With proper guards therefore,
to prevent abuse, and we think there would be
no difficulty in forming them, wo should prefer a
compulsory system, as being one best calculated to
distribute " eveir handed justice" arpong both debtors
and creditors. The interests of debtor and creditor,
ard so intimately blended, as to lessen considerably
the difficulty of guarding against oppression under a
compulsory system. The leading principle connecting
debtor and creditor, being interest, and the success
of the one depending so much upon that of the
other, that we need hardly fear, that any general
system, which may be adopted, will be likely to be
more abused than is the various insolvent laws of
the different States. As we have before said, however,
we shall be ploased to sec oithcr plan becomo a
law, which we have very little doubt will bo the ceso,
at least, so far as the Senate is concerned, and if tho
Houso will give it a favorable consideration, wo shall
' feci disposed to pardon it for much of the time spent
in doing nothing.
(D~A very large meeting of the Democratic Stato
Rights party was held in Savannah (Geo.) on the
21st inat. The call lor this mooting hid been signed
by nearly six hundred persons. The Hon. R. M.
Charlton, Mayor of the city, presided. An Address
and Resolutions wcro adopted, and several addresses
were made, embodying and enforcing the principles
of the present administration.
^
We arc indebted to the polite attention of the
Hon. T. D. Sumter, for a variety of public Documents,
and speeches, among them a copy of the Independent
Treasury Dill, as it passed the Senate. It
can be seen at this ofCco.
Wc arc also indebted to the Hon. A. G. Brown
of Mississippi, for a copy of his speech on tho appropriation
bill. We shall endeavor to lay a por.
l ion of this 3I3I0 speech before our readers.
Kiting 7?IaNia.?We do not mean by this expression,
the commercial operation, so frequently adopted
within the last few years, to raise the wind," but,
the good old fg?hioncd amusement of Kite flying.
This beautiful, bright and smiling month of May,
as tlic poets are .wont to call it, has turned out such
a boisterous jade, that the boys, and even children
of a larger growth, have devoted it to the pastime
usually enjoyed in blustering March. During the
past week, wo could scarcely turn our eyes in any
direction, upward, without encountering'some half
dozen Kites gracefully floating in the air, some of
them beautifully embellished with various omblcms.
It is a pleasant and innocent amusement, provided
sufficient care is taken to avoid tho frightening of
horses, which might be attended with "serious consequences.
We noticed last week, the return of Dabney, the
Virginia Bank dofaultcr, as also that of W. M. Price,
the absconding District Attorney. Wo have since
/ seen that ColIn G. NewComde, first Teller of the
Manhatton Bank, lias voluntarily given liim?elf fo
the New York police, H, J. Levis, tha runaway
Cashier of the Schuylkill Bank, has boon arrcstei
in Paris, so that nearly all the defaulters are in tin
hands of the law. Swartwout still remains incoi
rigible. Siielton, Pcckett and Hobson of the Bran
don Bank, have not yet had time for reflection. A
soon as the excitement of their trip to Texas is over
we shall look for them back.
The Hon. John M. Nii.es, late a Senator in Con
gross from Connecticut, has been appointed by thi
President, with the consent of the Senate, Postmas
tor General of the United States.

CONGRESS.
The Senate, we have noticed in another nrticle
as being busily engaged in discussing tho Bankrup
bill. The House, at our latest dates, had proccedei
soffar as to reach the Independent Treasury Bill. TJii
measure promises to be a fruitful theme for declama
mation, and will probably not be acted on until J
large number of members of both parties, shall be de
livcrcd each, of a speech for home consumption. I
can hardly bo for any other purpose, as not only ai
the mcmbors of Congress must have already mad*
up their minds on the subject, but tho question ha
so long been agitated in the country, that there i
scarcely a man who, by any possible means, could b(
made to feel any interest in it, who has not long sine*
come to a conclusion cither for or against it. Thi
discussion, furious and voluminous as it promises t*
be, cannot have in view the enlightening of'the pub
lie mind in relation to the particular bill, but must
we presume, like most of the speeches on the ques
tions which have already been decided, bo for thi
purpose of arraying in most captivating light, tli
merits of the aspirants to the Presidential chair.
