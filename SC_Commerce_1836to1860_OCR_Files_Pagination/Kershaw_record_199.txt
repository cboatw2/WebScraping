not bo loft destitute while we have loaves to divide

tho desolation of our boautiful city shall, in" tho end,

fho Committee appointed to investigate the causes
of tho late duel ih Washington city, by a self-transformation,
have been metamorphosed into a StarChamber,
and reported a resolution to expel Mr.
Graves, oeiwure decidedly Mr. Wise, and centure Mr.
Jones. Whatever bo tho merits of the daae. the conduct
of tho Cdmmilteo in repotting such a resolution
" prcsonts an act unparalclicd, oxcopt on tho bloody
cV^rocordii of tho inquisition, We have never^seen par.
ty malevolence carry itself so far as it has on the
present, occasion. Mr.' CiUyr?the acceptor of the
challenge,?because the. victim?has. been born ad
Deos; whereas, if Mr. Graves* had been killed, tlic
affair Wnld long since havo' been smoothed over and
his mommy forgotten, so far as any measures to vindicate
it were oonoerhed. Wo say for ourselves,
once fdr all, that his conduct lias our decided disap.
probation?arid so has Mr. Cillyhj. IIo did wrong
tochallcngo?-Mr. Cilly did wrong to accept. Here
they aro on ah oquality. Owing to this peculiar mode
of combat, tho doath of one wan certain; of both,
probable. Mr Cilly liappcned to bo that one, and he
is tho martyr. ; Mr - Graves happened to survivo,
and he is to bo persecuted with a living doath, to
which thofato of his opponent would .havo been tolerable.
Horc is neither-law nor justice. Let the arbitrary
report be recommitted with instructions to its
authors to confine themselves to tho topics assigned
thorn. Theaifthe House choose to arraign and ex.
pel Mr* Graves, let (hem do it. But they will never
* accomplish the prcvontf on of dueling by severity inr
flic ted on the survivor. So long as they honor him,
Who dies in this way, they will but be making a Blight
change, in the code of libnor, and instead of making
it diahono^qble not to fight a duel under any circumBtances,
they will only bo making it dishonorable not
to be killed. But let the 'worst come to tho wont,
and they have no right to expel Mr. Graves. They
may havo the power, but we insist that they have
not the right. It would Be enacting an ex-post facto
law, and strike at the very root of one of the articles
of our Constitution. For tho futijro, they may deoreo
what they please. They may, if they choose,
make a duel fought heneoforth in the Dist. of Columbia,
punishable by death, without the benefit of
Clorgy. But who would not ory out against the in.
flictionofsuch a punishment tif the present instance?
Yet in reality it would not be more onjastthan the sontenco
of expulsion, bocauM neither the one nor the
other has heretofore boon enforced, and. the punishment
of Mr. Graves by. eithor of ;thpm Would be
bringing hiin under a law that wan not in oxlstence
before his offence was committed to warn him
against its commission. It i* high time for the pross
vto view tliis mattor coolly and dispassionately. Erery
political cause of misrepresentation aud malevolence
has hecn done away, *The prediction of a
partisan that Mr. Cjlly would bo itioro beneficial to
his party by his' death than by his life has been
verified, had now, let justiCo resume her sway.

The express mail is discontinued between Louis,

and Gaston. The reason of this is, that" on the firet I

$71;937 per annum. To p?y tW? eoBt tfco Bxj&t fc

Consequently the Post Master General has wisely
concluded to stop it. The other lino firom New

Mr. Editor;?I perceive byCharleston
papers, (hat a call has been made on
his Excellency, the Governor of tne State,
for on extra Session of the Legislature;
for the purpose of taking into considera'
tion the best mod** of remedying the evils
growing out of the late conflagration of
that city. Believing that the Legislature
is the only power in the State, competent
to this relief, the proposition has rriy
tnost decided and hearty approbation; and
> believing as tdo, that it is necessary, just,
ant) proper; I permit myself to heliere,
that the call will he made Snd the relief
granted. Every citizen of the State is
probably in a greater or leas degree, interested
in the prosperity of Charleston,!
as the market at which1 we sell the products
of our labor, and purchase our necessary
supplies?and it is certain, as a
universal law of trade, that the prosperity
1 of the city, qr rather the competition of
[ merchants, will enable the consumer to
buy cheaper, and the producer to yeL

for men who haye families t<? anpport cant
walt a year for houses and brfo'd. On the
present occasion the claims of Charleston
are peculiarly strong, front thp'fact, that
a large portion of her a<^i?^^^,itaK has
been absorbed in the eoitstru^tihn of HheI
Rail Road to Hamburgh, and in the miilions
subscribed by her citizens to the
great Westesn Rail Road?which is reaiy
a State enterprise, and one in the completion
of which efery citizen must feet ?
an interest.- And may not the fact be,
that if the Legislature now refuses aid,
that even.this great enterprise may fail?
For it is likely that many Charleston
Stockholders would be unable to pav iheir
I f :r_* ...? ?
suoscripnons, una would consequently oe
compel let! to add to their present losses by
forfeiting what they have already paid oil
their stock; Further, would not the fart,
that Charleston was prostrate, have the
' efiVci of checking the gcneeal spirit of
| enterprise* on this subject, the roart is
made to connect great .commercial points.
If Charleston is permitted to recede in
her prospects, the object is lost, and with
it the energy and enterprise necessary to i
the successful completion of this great |
work. The road must go fro^i Charleston,
a great Commcreialjciiy, '<f U is ever
nYadc^otherWIse ti would' bS'Vtilifeless iT
made.
Can the.proposed aid be given without
injury to the general resources and prosperity
of the State? I have no hesitation (
in saying that it can. In the first place.
let the State create a stock, or bonds, to i
be sold in foreign markets, for'the sum of
money required. For illustration; I will ,
say three millions?payable in 10 or 20
years, as the Legislature may deem best.
There is no doubt on these Bonds, the
funds could be raised at from fiiur to five
per cent interests per annum.4, Thereby ]
supplying the capital, which has-been lost,
for all the' purposes of successful enter
prise. It is not proposed that the State
should do any thing further, than, put .

arranged by the wisdom and experience of
the Legislature. I would however suggest
as the best, which occurred to my 1
mind, to he, to add the amount borrowed
to the capital of the Bank of the Stat**,
during the continuance of the loan, with
t
the understanding that it was to be used so.
far as practicable, in aid of the sufferers ,
by the late fire?and the general commerce
of the city. If this is done, and '

that it the time of the resumption of Specie
