The tobacco crop in Virginia is likely to be a
short one.
Hamilton C. Jones. Esq., the able editor of the
Salisbury Watchman, has sold the establishment
to Messrs. Pendleton & Bonner.
Larqb Bests. The Augusta Chronicle says<
Mr. Wro? Harper, of this city, brought to our
effioe two Beets?one of them was twenty in.
ches in circumference and two feet long?the
other twenty inches in circumference and nearly
twenty in length. One weighs 6 1-2 lbs. and
the other 7 3-4.
Successive Crops of Silk,?Messrs. R. & H.
Carson, of Lancaster, Pa., in a letter to the edi
tor of the Journal of tho American Silk Society,
say : " We are now feeding a large quantity of
worms and will contirue to hatch out and feed
, successive crops during the season; have also
hatched out a parcel of worms which were pre
served in an ice house since 1837, and the worms
appear qaite vigorous and healthy, and do not
differ in any respect from those treated in the
usual way. The vitality of the silk worm con*
tinuing so long is a matter of great importance,
and was an accidental discovery. We are sorry
we did not reserve a portion of them in order to
ascertain how long their vitality could be preserved.*
Here if a fact in corroboration of several others
which have been published, showing that silk
worm eggs inay be preserved in an ice.bouse thro'
summer without loosing their vitality / and no
one doubts that when thus preserved they will
batch at any time when properly exposed to a
sufficient degree of warmth. We see no good
reason then to doubt that five <;r six full crops of
silk may be made in this climate in a sing e season,
each of which is equal to a cotton crop by
the same hands at present pri.es.
Silk Culturitt.?We have been a good deal
interested lately in looking over the back numbers
of this periodical. It is published monthly
in Weathersfield (Conn.) and a >ly e ited by
Judge Comstock. Price one dollar per annum. ,
For the first two years the price was only fifty
cents. The resent is the fifth year; of course
the price of the current volume and back num.
bers would be $4, but they are offered at $3 50
in notes of any solvent banks in the U. States,
remitted to the editor or any agent without put.
ting him to the expense of postage. The work,
besides such practical information as the culturist
might need, furnishes a history of the silk
culture in this country. We subjoin the names
and residence of a number of the agents, to some
of whom persons at the south wishing to procure
\the work might find it more convenient to make
* remittance than to the Editor.

Extract from a letter to the Editor dated
, 5th August, 1839.
Dsar Sir :?Among the various prints
which come to me from the Post Office* and i
believe there are no less than ten, I read nom
with more agreeable instruction than the
Cheraw Gazette. It is the agricultural de.
partment, together with the tone of moral scn<
timent which pervades it, (you do not take
to politics I am glad to find?party-politics J
mean) that is both pleasing and profitable.?
The Rice planters resident in this district are
paying more attention* than formerly, to farming
and the cultivation of provision crops?they
have brought the cultivation of the sweet po*
tatoe on a large scale, to great perfection.?
Selections in your paper relating to the man.
agement and breeding of stock, and on the
general management of a farm, prove parti*
cularly interesting and instructive to us. 1
am making an attempt to improve the coin*
mon stock of cattle by introducing a cross
with the improved Durham Short Horns, hav
ing procured out of GenL Van Rhensaeller'e
stock last summer a Bull calf of this breed
which was imported at 3 months old, with the
view to have him grow up, inured to the climate.
It is an experiment and I feel anxious
about it. At the same time I got a couple of
Piga of the pure Berkshire breed, believ..
ing that aa this breed had proved worthy
of all the care bestowed on it elsewhere
it would be an improvement to our native
stock of hogs; this also is an experiment.
Our stock of sheep has been decidedly improved
within the last 5 years?first by a cross with
the South down and Bakewell breed from the
stock of John Hare Powell, near Philadelphia,
introduced by my brother ,at<3
latterly by the iutraduction of the Broad-tail
sheep, imported from Asia, by Lieut. Pettigru,
of the Navy.
The first, generally well formed, was remarkable
for breadth of chest and perfection
in the brisket, (we regard the carcass chi< fly,
the wool being a secondary matter) the virtue
of the latter consists in its kindness to fatten
and the flavor of the mutton; the wool ia
coasre, and the tail is remarkably broad and
thick 1 have a Ram of this breed whose
tail would measure eighl inches in width.
I am forgetting the object, more nearly interesting
you, with which I commenced this
letter : pardon iny selfishness and accept my
congratulations on the institution of your
agricultural society. If I were not quite so
far from Cheraw I would be happy to become
one of you,
I have procured several new subscribers to
the Gazette, but they are all Rice-pl >nten

agreeable to you, to give us in every number
an indication of the state of the river u Che*

(We shall commence in our next a weekly

At a temperance moetmg held recently ir

Mr. Haws remarked, that in addition to thi
numerous premature deaths occasioned indirect

ten years, to follow to the grave, no less thai
one hundred and forty six persons, who died fron
Deleriuin Tiemens, all clear and decided cases

New YoRtf, August 3.
The money market has another spasm, and
' stocks are on the decline. The fall in the
t stock market for two days past is an indication
of sales to raise casn, and the inability to
obtain it on good notes in bauk. Even bank
post notes of Fbiladelphia sell at 11 and 12
' per cent, discount, and six p r cent, i reai
sury notes were to day sold in the market un,
der par, (99 12 per ceni.) t-.ough oearing nterest.
This shows a tight money market,
much pressure, and a very unsatisfactory aute
of things. - .
i' The holders of cotton continue to hold. If
, they are to die, they are determined to die
( very hard, and at least they mean to await
, their fate by the Liverpool, before they give
up at all.
The flour dealers also, for some cause or
> other, it is difficult to detiue what, or even to
, guess, so abundant are the crops, continue to
hold on tor higher prices, and flour is actually
on the rise. It is probable however, there are
, hopes of a market abroad. The supplies here
> are a so short. Again, the change of quota*,
tions from old flour to new flour makes an apparent
rise of price.
The domestic exchanges of the country upon
' the South and Southwest grow worse, and
I they are so bad it is hardly worth the whi'e to
| make quotations. How long the South and
.Southwest will suffer this, remains to be seen.
1 There is no union among the States now in
rrn ney matters. We are under the old Con>
federation. The union of trade and commerce
i is nullified now.
August 6.?The money market is tight,"
' and "tighter," and 1 trust the "tightest" it
will be tor some time to come. Two per cent.
1 a month was talked of yesterday, and in some
i instances got. It is stated that the Bank of
[ America has sent into market some of the
hypothecated Treasury notes on which Mr.
Woodbury has been raising money. The last
Treasury note statement of the Secretary in.

i notes to a largo amount. I should like to know
, what the Collector of New York does with
them, when he receives them for duties. I
should like to know who pockets the loss when
1 they are sold under the par of bank notes!
i Are they kept floating in a circle ? Are they
deoosited as money m bank, loaned out to pay
duties, an i then deposited, and re-deposited

August7.?The money market is not re'

r es) has been so heavy a borrower in Wall

The following curious circumstance occasioned
an alarm of fire at Philadelphia on
Thursday evening. Several children had been
put to oea in one of the rooms of John
M'Cabe's tavern, in L.ictitia Court, leaving
with them a lighted candle, which a hungry rat
seized and carried off, setting fire to the bedclothes
in passing underneath tho bed. The
children fortunately escaped uninjured, though
several quilts and biankets were destroyed.
TUB CHINCH BUG.
A letter from Fairfield District, dated the
( 4th inst., gives the fallowing account of this
new and formidable enemy of our grain crop.
' [Char. Cour.
, "The Chinch Bug has done serious injury to
, the provision crops in various parts of the up
country, but they are not general in their atl
tacks?some crops in the same neighborhood
i suffering severely, while ethers remain unin
j'ired, and some entire neighborhoods suffering
but lulle. It is not to be concealed, however,
? that they are (comparatively) a new and formidable
enemy to the farmer in nearly every
section of the State. They exist in the lower
country, but as yet not in numbers sufficient
to do any material injury. They collect in
shoals upon the stalks of 6tnall grain and corp.
and exhausting the juices, injure and at last,
destroy the plant. Drought is highly favorable
to their propagation and growth, while the
plant is of course less able, at such time, to re
1 eist their attacks."
MEW INVENTIONS.
5 It is no slight evidence of the inventive spir"
it of the age, that almost at the same turn*,

TERRIBLE TORNADO.
A tornado passed through a part of Connecticut
on \Vednesday afternoon, which was
terrific iD i s operation. The first account we
have of it is from New Haven, where, at about
noon, it destroyed several buildings, part of
them brick. The African church was among
the buildings thrown down. At North Haven
several houses were destroyed. Then it pas-1

unabated fury, tearing aii before it. Forests
and fruit treus were scattered in all directions,
and buildings torn down, some of them of
strong construction.
' A gentleman, who was in a stage at the

says he never saw such a torrent of rain as
{loured down. Several persons were whirled
into the air, aod a good many injured in various
ways. A family in the upper part of
New Haven had just sat down to dinnof in the

struck the house aud carried it away, leaving
the family and table untouched, though, we
suppose, not undisturbed. Some buildings

The Philadelphia Savings Institution has

said to be an extensive issue of certificates in
the form of post notes, which, as they reached
maturity, the company were unable to re
deem.
Here the poor who had deposited their little
surplus as a resource against the evil day, are
made to suffer because the Directors of the
Institution chose to make an "operation" beyond
their resources, and borrow from next
year. The deuce is, that when we borrow
from next year, we think it will never come.
When surefooted time brings it round, however,
we find it as inexorable as tho last?the
load which wehaveimprovidently thrown upon
it mu6i be discharged. Borrowers are astonished
to find too, that it has its own cares, necessities
and expenses, quite as tnuch as it

upon it from other times, and in the attempt
to conquer the multiplied difficulties, they fail

On Wednesday afternoon the 6th inst. at the

bia Mrs. fimiline McCord, wife ofD. J. M'Cord,
Esq.; aged 36.
At her residence near Darlington C. H. on
the 14th inst. in the 89th year of her age, Mrs.
Elisa A. Law, wife of Capt. Wm. Law, after a
'inhering illness of four or five months, during
which time and especially the latter part of it, she
appeared confidently to expect her dissolution
as an event near at hand; but with that meed noes
and resignation to the will of her Heavenly Fa.
thcr, which nothing but an abiding confidence
in the merits of the Redeemer could inspire the
hoart of one who contemplates the near approach
of the King of terrors. Death is indeed terrible
to many?but to her he had no terrors, He was
welcomed as a messenger of peace; as the
harbinger of eternal rest. The day before hoi
death she declared that she was at peace with
God, and with all mankind, and ready to deparl
whenever the summons should come. In hex
last moments, although the power of utterance
was denied her, yet by her manner sne c;oany
evinced a desire to depart and be with Christ.?
The expression of her countenance seemed to
ay i "Come Lord Jesus, come quickly." The
writer, who it od by her bedside, could but ex.
claim within himself, "Let me die the death of
the righteous, and let my last end be like his."
Charleston Observer.
We had been long and intimately acquainted
with the subject of tthis brief obituary record?
we have seen her in the chamber of affliction, in
the varied departments of the Christian Mother
Wife and friend, and in the House of God, and
j delighted to mark her meek, but bright example
in each. It may truly be said, hers was the
ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which in
the sight of God is of great price. She has left
five children, too younr, fully to appreciate theii
loss, but long, long will it be, e'r the impreesiom
of that gentle spirit, which watched the cradle
of their infancy and implanted in their opening
minds the seeds of virture, will be erased frotr
their memories.?Ed. Temperance Advocate.
