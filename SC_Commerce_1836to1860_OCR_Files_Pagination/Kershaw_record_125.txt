BRIGADE ENCAMPMENT?Wc have had
the pleasure of visiting Camp DeKalb severa*
times during the week, and have 1<een much gratified
at the evident improvement of the officers

Indeed they could not do otherwise than improve,
devoting themselves as they do, so constantly and
zealously to the discharge of their duties, and
liaving too, the advantage of the instruction of
such excellent officers as his Excellency Gov.
Butler, and Adjutant Gen'l. Jones, not to mention
others of very great merit.
Camp DeKalb is about four miles North of Camden,
near Cool Spring, a high and healthy situation
and admirably suited for an encampment.
There are about three hundred officers in attendance,
and if other inspiration than that of patriotism
were wanting to heighten their z ?al in the
faithful discharge of their duty, it would be amply
found in the daily visits of a large number of the
gentler sex.
An excellent band of music gives life and spirit
to the whole.
The closing scene which is generally rendered
most interesting, bv His Excellency's reviewing
and addressing the officers?the siriking of tents
4^c. will, we understand, take place this morning.
The 21st and 22d Regiments will be reviewed
on Tuesday next, at Griers store, on the main
road from this plnee to Laiiceslcr, and aboi|t 13
tnilcs from the latter place.
NEW COTTON.?Wo have not yet had a bale
of new cotton in this market, but we perceive that
romc has been received at Macon and Augusta,
Ga. and at Hamburg in this State. Sales at the
different places were made at from 12 1-2 to 13 1-2
cents. Tho latter we understand was given at
Hamburg. ?
OUR TOWN.?In an article last week under
this head, noticing the preparations making for
the business of the ensuing season, we said we
should refer to the subject again. We did not
intend to do it so soon, but as we are about vacating
our Chair as Editor pro tern, we beg leave to
do it now.
Our purpose now is to urge our citizens to renewed
exertions, in order to secure to Camden, all
the trade to which, from its natural position it is
entitled: Much ot the lethargy which for a long
period cliarecterized our town, lias been thrown
off, and a groat deal has been done?enterprize has
been awakened* exertions have been made, and success
has thus far attended those exertions?but
much yet remains to be done. We want however,
in the first place, a good turnpike road from
Camden to North arolina, via Lancaster Court
House, and we would respectfu'y nsli our fellow
citizens to reflect on the importance of this work,
and the advantages which would be derived
from it.
That Camden is not what she ought to be, and
ichal she loilL be, if her citizens are true to their
interests, tt only requires a glance at her natural
position and advantages, to prove. Every practical
man who has ever ventured an opinion, corroborates
our assertion. Mr. Mills, in his "Statistics
of South Carolina," published more than ten years
ago, says, speaking of Camden; "the gpogrnphical
position of this, town gives it great advantages
for (rade; and fully warrants every exertion to be
made to improve its facilities of communication
with the river." Sorriethir.g has hern dune during
the summer to improve the navigation, nnd more
will be done, we are convinced, if the s< bject is
duly urged on the attention of the Legislature.
Mr. Mills goes on to say, " by examining the
map of the two States, (North and South Carolina,)
"it will be easily seen that wealth and prosperity
await this town at no very distant day Its citizens
should therefore prepare for the re advantages,
by inviting permanent capital and population to
the place." Those are the views of a scientific
and practical man, and it only requires that we
should be constantly engaged in the work of improvement
to enable us shortly to sec our most
sanguine anticipations realized.
Wo are aware that it requires time to effect any
great work, but we have lost too much already to
permit us to waste any now. Let us therefore be
up and doing.
TIIE EXTRA SESSION.?'The Extra Session
of Congress will assemble on Monday next. The
special object of this session is to take the subject
of the currency into consideration, and to devist
some plan for the safe keeping and disburseinen
of the public revenue ; the Stale Banks not beinj
considered safe, since the suspension of speck
payment. Several plans have been suggested b;
the new? paper writers; one of these, and the on
which it would Ma front the indication* of the
Globe, ineou the approbation of thooe up authority,
is the establishment of sub?trMsuri#s'ih vtrioai
' parts of the country, tinder an organisation something
similar to the Post Office department, for
the purpose of disbursing the revenue. Other
writers urge the establishment of a National Bank,
while not a few think the Bute Banks', Or -rather
the present system with some alterations dfill answer
perfectly well. What plan will .be adopted,
it is impossible, from the apparent equal division of
opihioft, to say with any degree of certainty.
The leaders-'of the Courier, will, however, be
regularly advised of the moat importaul proceedings
of tlie session.
We beg leave td call the attention of dtfr readers
to an advertisement of Mr. Wn. K. Barclay,
Portrait Painter, which may be found in another
coluinfe oi to-day Vpaper.

the attention of the Commissioners of the
Roads of "laremont to the Bridges at
Smooths Mills, and the new rond to be
openpd by Mr. Willis Sp'ari.11 and Mr. Coldough.
1 have in reply only to say that
I ample re mil's will be made on the Bridges
at SrRoot's Mills ; but that I regret to say
I his eoinrndniealio'n was too late to have
anv effect ill reference to the new road?the
b.?apd have had iheir slated meeting
I and in their apportionment of hands to
| the.different roads have only allowed the
I road in question a sufficient force to make
i it passable for the present year. This
; information I feel it to bo my duly to
make, that I may not be censured for
doing less work on the road than those
interested in the same would desire.
I'lie immediate commis^oner for the
satisfacti >n of the friends of the road
above alluded to, would add, however,
that the cause of a scarcity of hands on
1 this road the present year, is on account
of the opening of a new road in the same
neighborhood, and that hereafter all due
attention will be given the road by Mr.

BEAUTY.?Ifow often do we hear
some one, wishing* for this tinsel ornament!
even the brightest literary characters,
stoop to desire personal attractions,
as if unconscious, that the beauty of the
mind alone, attracts the notice of the national
and the virtuous.
Of what value is personal beauty, if not
associated with a Cultivated mind ? it may
win the admiration of inferior intellects;
hut let a man oT soul and sentiment be
charmed with a blaze of personal loveliness,
and he will instantly ascertain if
there is a hidden gem heneath the beautiful
exterior. Like the flowers of summer,
beauty soon decays, and leaves not
a trace behind of its former loveliness?
from what source then must affection expect
happiness if the wife possess not a
polished mind, or any of those endearing
qualities which should distinguish the female
sex.
Personal bt auly contributes but little to
the eniovment of the domestic fireside?
J ?r * "" w
but in the polished mind of a woman,
there is a beauty which is calculated to
contend with the cares and duties of the
wedded life.. If the fair of the present
day would improve their minds as much
as they endeavor to improve their personal
beauty, we too mi<iht boast of a Madame
DeShuel, the brightest star in the galaxy
1 of female literature.
A LADY.
From Rew.Orlean*.
By the schooner Helen from Galveston,
arrived yesterday, we learn that on the
11'h, the <lay before her departure schooner,
Eliza Kussel had arrived at that port
I from the Alaeranes. in charge of a nriv.e
rr<w, she having hern taken by the Texian
schooner of war Brutus, off Sisal.
Tin* vessel was English, but was captured
as containing Mexican properly.
The officer in charge of the Eliza Rus'
s< I. represents that the squadron under the
command of II. Is. XI" mpson, had captured
and sent into Maiag< rda two Mexican
vessels loaded with dry goods. He also
stated that they had taken a number of
(other vessels which had either been held
1 to ransom, or after being gutted of their
' cargo, destroyed. In additition to ||us,
t Thompson had landed on the coast and
I burnt all the villages, with the exception
t of Santa Clara from Cape Catouche to
f Sisal. Both the schooners were crowded
b with goods taken from the enemy, and all
on board remained in high health and
spirits. Thompson proposed to cruise a
few days longer down the Campeachy
coast, before returning to port. It is not
unlikely that this man may prove a second
Paul Jones to the Texian navy.
We lately noticed the captbre of Col.
Wharton when -going with prisoners to
1 Matatftoras. The news has been confirrn'
ed by the arrival of that officer in this city,
| he having fonnd iheans to make his escape
from his captors, when, we understand,
they Were talking of shooting him.
Ej^traordinakX Monomania.?The subject
affected with the monomania we de- i
scribe is a fine youth of a sanguine temi
pcrainent, robust and elegantly formed,
1 about twelve years of age, the son of a
j respectable Italian broker, residing at present
at one of his relation's country, seats
in the neighborhood of Carnpo . Grand.
m i.i t * * 1 * '
tins iieaiidiui ooy penectiy tractable, and <
sound in all his mental faculties, will not
allotv any one t6 touch him, or even to '
touch the bed where he lies or the chair i
upon which he^ sits. If by chance (and
no demonstration of mania is otherwise
evinced) one should put his finders upon j
him, he immediately shrieks aloud, strips j
oft' all his clothes, washes himself all over'
and will not use the same again, except
they are previously, 1 itcu himself, submit f
tevji to a luvation. This extraordinary ma- ,
uia secludes him from the approach of t
every person except a woman, 1 believe a j1
relation, who can do every thing she plea- '
scs with him,apd as she herself expressed, (
; even make his bed. On being desirous to !!
! see this tortured youtli, we applied to this 1 \
, woman, who very kindly introduced us to ;
him, and wc were admitted without any |
difficulty, and conversed with the boy, on
our pledging our word to him that wc
shonfd not touch him. We found him I
exceedingly interesting, and in spite of1
his appearing mistrustful of us as slran
gors, nevertheless, he conversed very j
freely with ns, and perfectly coherent in
all his renlioa flvir.eiiur lhi> rnnof rwilit.. I
. ? - , ? , I.
I manners ami perfect good breeding. Wo
endeavored to obtain from this woman,
whom we may justly call Ins bosom friend, |
the history of this extraordinary aberration,
and the information we could collect
i was, that about four years ago, a gentleman
who appears to be the boy's godfather
returned from Pernatnbuco, after a
long residence in that place, but unfortunately
affected with a polypus in his nose J
in a state of ulceration. This youth, who
was then eight years of age, being often
caressed by his g<- ifather, conceived at u 1
time a natural disgust for that horrible malady,
and as we suppose, tie had been urged j,
to express his gratitude for the attention i
thus bestowed upon him, lie smothered his
I disgust, and had frequently recourse to
I washing after the dreadful pollution, imparled
by his unwelcome sponsor. The
gentleman died shortly after, ami from
that time this monomania commenced,
which afflicts both the youth and his
friends, whenever any meeting lakes place.

of Joseph Hess, was found in this county
on Sunday last, by some of bis neighbors,
suspended to a tree by the neck with {
null berry bark. A Jury of Inquest was j
held over the body by Messrs. Allen and i
Charles A. Rose. Esqrs., and the circum
stances appear to be these. Mr. iless c
left home on Thursday the. 17th, in the f
evening, to go squirrel hunting; and he
j ha"ing been in the habit of staying from 1
home several clays ata tiinc, his family were
not uneasy about him. His neighbors
who found him were attracted to the spot
by the little dog which went with Mr. t
Iless hunting, barking at the buzzards,
which were assembling over the body. '
Close to where he was suspended were two
squirrels also suspended by the neck with
mulberry bark, his clothes all taken off
and spread over the squirrels, and his gun j
and shetpouch setting against a log near!
him. The Jury's verdict was, that said '
Joseph Hess caused his own death in a fit ,

comprise a full and faithful r cord of all
that is done in Conor- ss?sketches of the attendant
discussions, with an Appendix contaiaing the
finished speeches prepared by the members themselves
they are suited not only to gratify tho
curiosity of the hour, to inform the distant c mslituency
of the pnrt performed by their immediate
representativi s, and of the result of the labors ot
all ; but, we doubt not, they will be found permanently
Useful as the most authentic, complete, and
convenient parliamentary record of our times.,
This undertaking h ving. with t' ese views, been
liberally patronised by (tie public, it is our purpose
to justify this early and c? ntinu< d favor by increasing
the strength of our corps of Reporters at
the next lull nnd winter Sessions. The t-'all rgu
sinn will bo looked 1o by tlio country to settle all
that lias been unsettled by the overthrow of the
system of Dcpnsdes as established Congress?- "
the overthrow of the curicncy as established br
the ( onstit ution?and the overthrow of the system
of revenue, both as. n means of adequate supply
for prev a demands, the maintainance of rntmi*
factor, a. and the regulation of commerce. Every
thing pecuniary interest to the Government
and the nation will fie invoked i the discussions
of tie iext Congress; an?l it wiu because the Pre?
sideni w old not have those all important subject*
left to Executive discretion a moment beyond the
time when a full Congress could he summoned;that
the September session was convoked. The
machinery ??t government, even when thrown out

direction. The Kepiescntntives of the people arc

condition of things at present existing, to snbstitute
Executive expedientH for clparly (defined law
springing from the publie will.
