? FLORIDA.
From the Correspondent of the New York Era, at
Key WeH.
Messrs. Editors.?We have but very
little news since I wrote last. The expedition
under Lieutenant Powell of the
Navv, from the Everglades came in here,
staid a week; and stored their boats iu the
United States Barracks. The officers are
very iiitelligent. It seems to be the genera)
opinion that the command must be
given to young officers, and the war carried
on summer and winter, before the Indians
ran be driven from Florida. T.ntnlv tln>v
killed two post riders near Tampa. One
of the murderers were taken, and he confessed
He shot the rider, because he wanted ,
his horse. Sam Jones and his party are
now quietly getting in their crops, and
_ will be ready for another campaign as
soon as the whites can be mustered to meet
them. The citizens of the Territory
bordering on the Indians are in a state of
great alarm; and, in some places, have j
tied again to the Forts. On Key Largo, j
where Wharton was killed, opposite the ;
light ship, a party of Indians in a canoe
chased a Jurtler, or fishing bout, and shot
^ at the men: fortunately the poor fellows
^escaped. Should any thing further trans
"*\pire, I will write you immediately.
"We hare lately perused a letter from
an officer of the army in Florida, dated
at Fort Brooke, the latter part of December,
and were so much pleased with the
description given of his journey to the
Everglades, that we have obtained permission
to make an extract therefrom.

"The country this side of the Kiseimmec
is generally a pine barren. On the
Kissimmcc, the land is rich and beautiful,
and when I saw the live oak groves,
lakes and creeks, with banks lined by
^ cane brakes, like oricntial jungles, I, for
the first time, appreciated BarlrairTs
glowing description of Florida. It is,
indeed, a paradise for savages, and will
some ilny be considered the garden of
America. On the banks of the Kissiminee,
and the numerous lakes which discharge
their waters into it, there will be
cotton, rice, and sugar plantations, as licit
as those of St. Domingo, On this side
of these rich lands, there are high sand
hills, with lakes and ponds of good water
011 their very summits?delightful spots
for their summer residences, in case the
alluvion should prove unhealthy during
the summer season. I remained in Col.
Taylor's camp several days, nnd made excursions
in every direction. The famous
and undefined everglades commence in
that quarter. At this season, the appearance
of the everglades like that of a
boundless field of wheat in the yellow or
brown. A species of grass, about five
feet or upwards in height, covers the earth,
and extends below the horizon. Tho
country is perfectly level, and the winds
?-- - which arc always blowing, wave the grass
like a troubled sea. Near Fort Gai diner,
which is seventy miles due cast from here,
there are strips of hammock land, and
when the surface rises a little, of pine
barren; but the Indims state thit in the
lower part of the Territory, the praric
land stretches to the horizon all around
you, except here and there a few spots of
woad, called islands.?Mobile Commercial

Toleration.?There should be a perfect
toleration in matters of religion. In
what relates to the salvation of a man's
soul, he is more concerned than I can be;
luid to pretend to dictate to him in this
. particular, is an infinite piece of impertinence
and presumption. But if a man
has no religion at all, that docs not hinder
me from having any. If he stood at the
church door and would not let me enter,
I should have a right to push him aside,
but if he let me pass by without interrup-j
tion, I have no right to turn back and!
draw him after me. He might as well j
force me to have no religion, as I force
him to have one, or burn me at a stake
for believing what he docs not.
Opinion, "like the wild goose, flics,
unclaimed by any man;" heaven is like
" the marble air, accessible to nil;" and
therefore there is no occasion to trip up
one another's heels on the toad, or to
erect a turnpike gate to collect large sums
from tho passengers.?How have I right
to make another pay for the saving of my
soul, or to assist me in damning his??
There should be no secular interference
in sacred things; no laws to suppress or
establish any church or sect in religion;
no religious persecutions, tests, or disqualifications;
the different sects should
be left to inveigle and hate each other as
much as they please; but without the love
of exclusive domination and spiritual
power, there would be little temptation
to bigotry and intolerance.?Hazlitt.

Our readers will find some very interesting com.
munications in to-day's paper. We hope to hear ofton
from tho correspondents who havo so kindly furnish,
ed them. " No Enemy to Banks" may find some
diSsentors among our community, but we hope to
bo clearly understood that our columns shall always
bo opon to any strictures on this or any other com.
munication we may publish; always.provided that
such strictures are written in a proper spirit. Our
paper is not a political paper, for sovorol reasons.
Among others, because we do not think such a pa.
per suited to tho wants of our community; a com.
merciol paper and advertiser, is the kind needed and
such an one is ours. Nevertheless wo do not feel
bound to exclude all articlos of a political character,
especially, since those of an opposite way of think,
ing aro always at liberty to reply to them. As for
ourselves, we hopo to be able to claim tho vordict
of, at least, impartiality, for wo havo few sympa.
thios in common with either of tho two great par.
tios, now on tho political chess.board, and shall
therefore have no temptation to violate our ncutrali.
ty in fdvor of oitlior.
Wo must seriously represent to our subscribers the
necessity of thoir complying speedily with tbc terms
of subscription. Unless this is done the paper must
incvit ibly bo discontinued. It is as utterly impos.
sible to carry on a newspaper without monoy, as it is
to broatho in an exhausted receiver, or to livo on
barnaclo*. Rut however much the corporeal na.
t uc o^cditors may become accustomed to the cthon a.
lity of diet to which they are so often doomed, thoy
invariably find that the natures of othor mon can never
be similarly transformed. It does vory well to
live on promisos and hope deferred?like the Irishman,
they aro used to it?but owing to the perversity
of human nature, they can novor persuade
their creditors to suffer thorn to cancel their
obligations with the like commodity. They havo to
pay down hard money for ink, paper, typo, house
rent, journeymen's wagos and the like, just exactly as
ii tlioy were paid by their subscribers in the samo
manner, and so long as this is the case, it is a matter
of no moan consequonce, that they should roceivo
somewhat of tlio wherewithal to satisfy the demands
against them. Wo often enjoy a good, sober, quiot
laugh over the carnostness with which our brother
editors are entering into tho currency question. Ono
would suppose from the amount of thunder which
they expend upon it, that it was one in which they
wcro in somo slight dogiee, personally concerned.
But this is a grand mistake. For all tho good tlicy
derive, it is no difference whether tho currency consinta
of gwKl| diIt.. *r l.iu>|>l?atoiB. mucoa, it debts
wero paid in oyster shells, we believe, verily, it
would be just as hard Tor thorn to colloct as it is now.
We do not think it is the value of tho money, that
makes subscribers delinquent, but tho simple opinion
seems to havo obtained by common consent that a
paper is endowed with an inherent vitality which is
independent of any oxtraneous influences, and to pay
any thing towards its support, would be as supereror.
gatory, aa to pour in a kettle of hot water to keep
up the hoat of a steam boiler. We do beg Ioavo to
assure them that they are totally in the wrong. Our
protest may bo feoblo, but it is founded deeply in
cxporioncc. If they fail to bo convinced by it, wc
briefly recommend them, as a matter of philosophical
investigation, to mako the experiment. It will only
take ono week to satisfy their curiosity, and to more
than convince their judgtnents.
Wc are glad to observe among other improvements
of tho ago, that poetry is on the rise. Tho New
York editors, in particular, aro making wonderful
advances in the divine art. Tho Now York Gazette
has felt tho afflatus, among tho rest, and dclivors
itself of tho following couplet, in praise of a favorite
who has roccntly started a coffee-house. After
enumerating a good many circumstancos, it ascribes
to them as an effect, that
" They will make his houso tho focus and head quarters,
Of those whose business is on the Groat Wators."

The General Assembly.?Strange news have
been received in rolation to this body. They assembled
in Philadelphia, as appointed, and tho pro.
ccodings were entered Up6n as usual. The opening
sermon had been proachcd by the Moderator, and
tho IIouso was ready for business, when Mr. Cleveland
of Michigan, aroso and commenced reading a
papor in rolation to the proceedings of the former
Assembly towards the oxcised Synods. As he,
himself, is a member of one of the said Synods,
and mcreioro not a membor 01 ine rreaoyienan;
church, he was ordered to desist. But he would not
bo silenced, and having concluded his paper, ho
moved that Dr Beman of Troy, N. Y. bo elected
Moderator. Tho motion was carried by a largo Majority,
and tho Dr. duly installed. .It was then
moved that tho Assombly adjourn to Dr. Barnes*
church, which was also carried, and the New.
School party forthwith adjourned accordingly. Wc
cut tho following iVom tho Philadelphia Sentinel,
from whioh tho above information was derived.
The old school people, who seemed to
form a small minority, remained where
they were, and proceeded to transact their
business as if nothing had happene^.
Tne Rev. Mr. Plumer, of Virginia, was
elected Moderator* without opposition.
This branch of the Assembly ihen adjourned
until 5 o'clock* when they reassembled
and resumed business*.
The two parties are now fairly separated?both
claiming to ba th General Assembly?and
it is not likely they will ever
net together again. Whien is the Gonersl

Mr. Editor :
In 1--. !- *
I mu yuur ia.si, 111 sumo remnrKs upon the
I enlightened,liberal and patriotic suggestions
of t'Carnc*rn,'* I demonstrated th:it
even an annual surplus of income, or the
sum proposed to be borrowed, of three
per cent, beyond the interest on the State's
bonds, would in seventeen years only,
being rc-invcsted at eight per cent, continually,
accumulate an aggregate profit
equal to the capital borrowed, by which
that capita! could be paid, and <>f course
making the amount originally borrowed,
clear gain to the Banks, (to the country)
besides the incalculable gain% arising from
the stimulus infused into our commerce
and industry generally.
1 have since pursued the calculation
further, and find that were two per cent,
annually reinvested at eight percent, (the
average Bank dividends) will it in 21 years
amount to 100 to the principal.

MR. CALHOUN'S CONSISTENCY.
Gen. Gordon, of Virginia, in a recent
letter to a member of Congress, states
distinctly that the Bill which he (Gen Gordon)
brought into the House of Represent
tatives in 1834 providing for a total separation
("divorce") of the Banks and the
Government was drawn up and introduced
upon consultation with Mr. Calhoun..
For this Bill, or a kindred measure,
(the principle) 96 whig' members voted at
that timcy and the whole administration
phalanx against it:
The main bodies of both parlies have
since chasscr'd-changed sides, except the
little spartan State Rights band, with Calhoun
at their head, who have .9ttn?*fi-?*
while the others have each countermarched
upon them.
Yet a venal press, and unprineiplcd no
liticians have had the audacity to charge
them with having gone over to the enemy.

HARD MONEY.
Mr. Editor: ? A pure metalic money,
for the United States, lias been pronounceil,
from high quarters, the most eutopian,
and impracticable of all the ' waking
dreams of modern schemers.'*
? o
Let us, however, apply the test of a
few facts to the question of its practicability.
Upon the authority of the highest names
in the country, (the Calhouns, VV. bsters.
Ar \ I aoouma f I* * f 1 Ai\ 1112- ... - ^ 1 1 *
I . uomuHV mil l I "IU IIIIIIIOI1S OI dollars
of circulating medium, (money,) whether
' of specie, or paper, or both together,
would be at this time, an ample, if not
excessive sum.
There is now in the. Banks 50 millions,
and in the hands of individuals prnbal ly
40 millions; making an aggregate of 90
millions of dollars.
But how can the balance of 50 millions
be procured? I answer?in the same way
that 60 millions has been added to the
specie of the country, since 1830, and!
that too after liquidating an immense lor-,
eign debt, accumulated within that period.'
By carrying the process of a change
from fluctuating- rags to solid staple coin,
through a period of ten years, and allowing
for tke increased demand for currency
during that period, arising from the increased
business of the country?(say 2
1-2 millions annually?) an aggregate increase
of 7 1-2 millions only yearly, will
be necessary.
An equal average increase lias taken
place in the last period of 8 years, and
and without any diminution of imports of
articles of luxury or necessity?indeed in
the face of oxcessive imports of such ^articles.
.
If, therefore, during the last term of
8 years, the beginning of which was
' marked by depression, and the end by
| disaster end the payment of a heavy foreign
debt, the impulses have doubled, and
the aggregate increase ??f specie amounted
to 60 millions, why should it b* deem*
O
1*
* A
, . , ' 4;
cikimpracticabte to add, during the ? ?
ten years,- 78 millions more? Making
with the sum at present in the country,
165 million.
But it is feared that the process of a return
to a pure specie currency urflfclu
' cause a ruinous decline in prices?crush
the whole debtor class of the country?
repress enterprizc and paralizc industry.
In reply to all this, I adduce the stubborn
J/acfs of the last 8 years, viz: Au g.ccui
nrt ? ?
niatuxi/n uj xjvj minions, in the race of
constantly increasing exports and imports
and rapidly ascending prices on every
species of property, and an unparalleled
developemcnt of the resources of thcountry.
The country has to be sure recoiled
under the tremendous shock of last
spring, but has, even now, almost recovered;
and prices of property have at no
time descended to the point of 1830, although
the currency has been reduced
from 170 to 100 millions of dollars. I
say to 100 millions, because that is the
amount of paper money, and there is but
little gold and silver actually performing
the function of money.
Yours, &.c. &c.

THE SUB-TREA^UIIY SCHEME.
Mr. Editor:?It is roundly asserted
thut the Banks cannot survive the operalion
of this ''odious measure." So its
enemies and their friends say.
If true, then they are rotten, rickettv
concerns, and the sooner their soundness
is tested, the better for the country.
There arc in the United States about
800 Banks, with an aggregate capital exceeding
#300,000,000.
The income of the government will not

annually, and there cannot, upon an
average, he in treasury, ami withdrawn
from the Banks more than 8 millions
Of tliis, during the 1st .year only 1-6,
under Mr. Calhoun's amendment, and be
demanded in specie?amounting therefore,
during the Is/ year to only about 81,300,000?the
2c? year 82,600,000 and so on,
increasing gradually through the whole
period of 6 years, and giving the Banks
time to prepare for the change.
I repeat therefore, if such a trifling de
maud?thus gradually increased, car
break them, or even cripple their opera,
tion, they arc hut 44 a beggarly account o
empty bottles," and the sooner they arc
crushed the better.
I But there is no truth in the allegation?
and those who own and manage and are
well informed of their strength, know better.
They know that it will not endanger
their safaty, hut they foar it will diminish
their enormous gains?there lies the
rub.
1 ought to remark however, that t c
whole of even 1-6 will not be drawn froir
the Banks, because there is probably, 01
will be when they resume, 50 millions ii
\ circulation, upon which mass a portion >
the demand for specie by the goverumeii
will fall. I say, when they resume, because
as soon as they do so, generally

[from resuming at all. Then, 1 say n<?ain,
they are rotten, fraudulent, and ought to
he put to the test.
But it is manifestly absurd that so slight
! a demand for specie can prevent them resuming.
It max/, however, furnish a preexl,
for * being always ready to re$\ime,
but not resuming.'1
Is there any man, not utterly blinded
by the Bank mania, who believes that the
demands of the treasury under the proposed
plan would be even perceptible
upon the operations of the Banks of S.

1-3 to be in deposite, upon an averagethat
is 160,000, and 1-6 of that in specie,
will be $30,000 permanently withdrawn
from the Banks! will this bruak them?
If so, once more I say let them break.
