was asserted that the production would be b
f -,000,COO bales, in the face of a product a
1 1,358,000 ; and, in the face ofa dr uglit of I
unexampled intensity this season, it is affirm* 2
ed with equal truth, that that of the present e
year would reach 2,300,000 bags, which, e
is no event, can exceed an average one. f
No article of agriculture and commerce in
ths whole civilized world, is exposed to such d
accumulation of dangers, as our gn at staple*
Even that pestilent drung of oriental I
luxury ; the expulsion of which has recen.'Iy !
convulsed a mighty empire to its centre
seems less an object of hostile combination I
among those at least, who purchase it a! 1
though it dispenses madness and dea h, than
a staple which gives to man his most heal- 1
ibfal raiment; and which rivals the fleece ]
the lamb in its softness, and the miracculous
results of the industry of the silk worm in I
the firmness and beauty of the fibre. s
We desire no monopoly. If the agents
of foreign houses are willing to give it high- ]
cr rate of advance than the Banks, let them i
* take with the Cotton, the risk of such adven
tares. Alt that we wish is, to place a por.
tion at least of the Cotton crop beyond the
reach of coeicive sales, under the death
, . warrant of a 60 day bill, that has run to maturity.
Wo wish, moreover, to place at
^ least a portion of the crop, beyond the blighting
itrikieiicu of ;'>oia thaoriuft of fiuance, J
which, although they may have cmaanted
from the highly respectable parlor at the
Bank of England, are not to be found in
the philosophy of Smith or Ricardo, which
have struck, in the last summer, a blighting
influence, not only on the American trade,
but have prostrated one of the greatest
branches of the gigantic industry of the British
Empire; under the fain and absurd
hop;: of stopping during an obviously unfa- ,
voruble state of trade and a deficient harvest,
that stream of gold which was as cer.
tain to flaw out of England as the father of
oar wfetfftn whtcrs is to roll his current to
the ofeean. These wise men, in ih?-ir generation,
have indeed done their wor*?-they
have prostrated American interests, and all
the interests in their own country connected
with our own, but th4 fatal tide still flows
on.
And if our Banks Jesirc that a portion of
this stream shall be lavished on our own
shores, let them turn to our great staple,
which, under a judicious course of trade,
wiil command the precious meiois from
every quarter of the Ulobc.
To our associate pi an important branch
of our iudustry, thfi Cotton Planters of the
couDTryy-"***~4K0ulti address a voice of sym
pathy and wafnThg^-?^Wpuld Jell them
that the mode by.which the prodoct wfdieir
capital and skill Is disposed of in the great
* market of its consumption, is enough to
B break down thofoost valuable staple, next
B to the stuff of lilt', which Gud has given to
man.
F They must fjol rest satisfied with the un
certain calculations*!* the product of a crop,
|L liable to be <at short al*most to the last
monfeent of it/ gathering, by the viscissitudes of
the season. Whether it be a large or a
smftiione, 9judicious system for offence it
for Kile in His great foreign markets of its
I consumption, is equally the part of policy
k ani wisdo/n. The fnct is oot to be conft
ce^ed iii/spite of the depressed state of
I tra e in Jjngiand, if the Aoet can liouses in
B- LKcrpoel had held this year, the stock of
C^ton which was consgnod Humphries &
Jty die done, during the last; from ten to

tn J a crop of onexampleJ shortness. 1
The production of our staple treades so 1
4>sely on the measure of consumption, that i
mall the articles of commerce, it requires i
ihV utmost care in its sale ; yet perhaps i
. vceives tiic least. We ought to reflect 1
vtu.i wou'd be the extent of the calammty i
" wiich would befal our country, if it were to
breik down to a point which would not
covir the cost of production. For to tho 1
uplajJs of tho South, it is our only remun.
ierulog product. An efficient scheme of (
protcron, for 0 few years, will make all

BANK OF ENGLAND. v
A suspension of specie payments by the v
