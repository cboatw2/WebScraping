tha1t the nehula of Hercules is- at a much
greater distance from us eveti than-this.
What then must have been the magnitude
of a body so great as to he visible" to the
unassisted eye of an indiiviual on this
carth, itt a distance so inctinceivable? Had
all the celebrated comets of antiquiity, and
all that have been observedf ini modern
times, been combinod, they would not h7ave
formed one that othl have been seen over
- one hundreth purt the distance. No comet
has ever yet beo seen as far otT as the orb
of Saturn, with ine best telescopes, and few
an far as Mars: and wihat anust have been
the angular velocity.of the comet, if indeed
it was a comet, which lie saw. io have
swept over such a vast section or the hen
veus, and that too in perhaps less than one
minute of time? li wits certainly the first
heavenly body whose angular velocity was
suflictntly great to be appreciated by the
naked eye; for the angular motion of a hea
venly body must equal 20 degrees per hour
in order to be visible; and no comet whose
velocity has been recorded. has ever exceed
ed a fourth of this distance per hour. Ac
cording to Regiumuntanus, the comet of
1472 moved over an are of the heavens of
120 degrees in one day. Brydone observ
ed a comet at Palermo, in 1770, which
passed through 60 derees of a great circle
in the heavens in 24 hours. nid the great
comet of 1680 swept half round the sun in
. 10 hours and a half, moving at the amazing
rate of 8s,o00 miles an hour; and, necord
ing to Mrs. Somerville. if its etormous cen
trifugal force had ceased when passing its
Perihelion, it would have fallen to the sun
in nhout three tninutes. as it was then only
~ 147,000 miles from his surface. Bit if the
aRtoni%hing motion of all thes(l comets had
been combined and given to one, its velocity
even then would have been as the flutterine
of a vampire to the engle's dart from his
nztire heights, when compared to the one
- which your c-rrespondent saw lie far
ther states, that it tlrew n glare about the
spectator equal to that of a candle. iThe
mot luminois comet that ever appeared
perhaps on earth. was the one that made
its appearance 43 years before Christ, and
justfter the death of Julins Czstr, which
could he seen in daylizhit with the naked
- eve, nnd was supposed to have appenred
acain in 110G, and then resembled the sun
in brit!htness. Anothter appeared in 1402,
so hrill-Int as to be seen at nnonlay. The
great comet of IS1, shone with n light on1lY
eqial to ote-tenth the liht or tihe mooni.
But if all.these comets, with our sun in the
' midst of theti. were placed as far from ts
as the nebula in the constellation [leretules,
they would tint she-l one hundreth part the
light.around v,our correspondent that his
comet did. lie snys, too that his apinlion
oxtravagant as it may appear. is by no
means at variance with the opinions of
some of the aleist modern astronomers.

uplion the neriolicn rettrrs of the comet

obiservations opon the snme comet. in isti
fietion of hi concltsionq. Ile says that
the latter of these gentlemen adopts the
generallv received opionio, that h tle pro

for he surelv never inte,ndid to meatn that
the diminution ofa henvenly body, movinl
in vacuo. could diminish its centrifl!al

CATAWBA SPRINQ8,
LINCOLN COUNTY, N. CAROLINA.
T HE Proprietor of this Establishmenu
gives notice, that he is repairing and
fitting it up at considerable expense, and in
a superior style,and will have it ready or tie
reception of company by the 201h of May.
It is situated on the great Eastern and West
ern Lino of Stages, from 'alisbury via.
Lincolton to Asheville, &c.T stage pass
ing there every day in the week but one).
The country around is broken and prover
bially healthy, and besides the mineral
properties of the water. there are many in
ducements to turn the attention of invalids
and others towards this place. Its prox
inity to 1he lower conntry-the cheapness
of hying-the excellence of the neighboring
society-the alundauce of game, and the
rich field afforded to science, especially to
mineralogy and botany, are facts not to be
overlook.ed by the travelling world. But
it is in the mineral qualities of the Springs
tit the great attraction to this spot consists.
'he proprietor has no exaggerated lists of
cures to present to the Public, for he hans
just taken possession, nor would he deem
it a complimntit either to the good taste or
sagneity of the public, to present such ifhe
had them. But he has the assurance ofsome
of the mlost scientific ph .jysicians and chem
its, to the rare al valuable properties
of these Springs. In 1824. Professor Olin
sted, (now of Yale College) made a strict
analysis of this water, nl pronounces its
foreign imgredients to le: Sulphurctted Hy
drogen, Sulphate of Lime, bullphateof Ma
nesia, Muriate of Lime.
For a more extended statement see his
Geological Report of North Carolina, au
thorized ly Act of Asseibly, pages 129

very flattering remark of' this gentleman.
bit any one at all acquainted with tle s-jb
ject cannnot help perceiving the peculiar a
da ptation of these mainaerals to the disorders
that prevail at the South.
The Proprietor can only suaperadd his de
terinant ion to mtf1cl patronage by an taflilaela
ing attentiona to the wants, wishes and com
forts of his visiters.
The Sprinms are naow,and will be thrrigh
out the year, openl for the nacommodation
of travellers.

PROCLAIAMATION.
STATE OF SOUTII CAROL[NA.
By His E.rcelenmcE PIP1nCF M. BUTLER,

T iff recent Fire iu Charle.-ton, has laid
waste 14.) ncres or the miost populous
part of the City-hasc destroyed buildings
and their contents, %aluod between tfiaree
and four millions of dollars-as deprived
great n nhers of iidutirious men of the.
mean,.of re-instatiug their property pros
tratedl in the commou devastation. It ias
greatly injured all the In.-mrance Olices,
and rendered bankrupt others in the State.
(the aiount pf ropcrty ii-treel elsewhere
being comlparatively Iali.) it has do
prjved the baik deltors not only of the
means of patying thcir present deh~ts but of
procuring future loans and faiiitifes, now
more than ever, greatly needed, and in
manny cases absolitely indispewable to save
the unfortunate (lebtor firmn utter dertric
lion. It has put to hazard the ultimato
success of our great national improvement
the irestcrn Ta:l road, and the domstic im
porting coni.1ny ; and with these, it threat
cns to jieopardise the futtre prosperity and
the high characf-r and standing orthe State
which las so n1obly pa-tronised these wise
and extenllire sclietmes of public irnprove,
tlent.
Under these circumstances. the late mis
fortnue as-uimes decidedly noit a partial and
local., but a gener.al national mpect. In
various ways it n ill be fell. aml severcly

many wise and worthy iev de'i ari extra
session of the Legislature unadvisable: but
the great weeight it opinion transmitted to
me, is in favor of the measure. It is to our
Legislature, that our people look on all oc

We are accustomed. to rely implicitly oil
