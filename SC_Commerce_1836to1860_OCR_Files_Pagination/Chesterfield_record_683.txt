ENGLISH AGRICULTUNE? A GLANCE AT ITS
PROGRESS AN1> FROSPECTS.
By John Hannam, North Dcig'iton, Weth
erby, Yorkshire, England.?(Concluded.)
And the general results or rue same agency
throughout England are, that
wheat, instead of bring a luxury confined
to the rich, is now tho staff of the poor
man's strength. The quaking morass
and the arid moor wave with the golden
grain, and the acre which formerly gave
back four times the seed, now returns it
from eight to ten fold. Instead, too, of
winter being a season of starvation to the
cattle, when existence was all that could
be hoped for, it is now essentially the sea.
son for fat and plenty ; for, it is now essentially
the season for fat and plenty;
for if the turnip cultivation has given the
grazier the power of increasing the quantity
% the skill of the breeder has equally
increased the quality of his stock. This
will be seen from the estimated weight of
cattle and sheep at Smithfield market, at
three different periods, by Davcnant,
McCtilloch, and Youatt.
1810, Da vennnt estimates cattle at 26 st.
6 lbs. Sheep and lambs, 2 st. each.
1830, McCullocli do do 39 st. 4 lbs.
Clo iJ. 81. o 108.
1840, Youatt do do 46 st. 12 lbs.
do 6st. 6 lbs.
But all theso may be summed up in one
grand national result, that while ire have
waxed in name and in numbers, wr have increased
still faster in wealth and in the
means of life*
Such, then, is a brief glance at the
progress of English agriculture. Trivial
as has been the record which we have
been able to give of it, sufficient of both
cause and effect has been developed, in
the history of the past, to make our prophecy
for the future a golden one. Such
prospects, we are inclined to believe, are
not merely because it is natural to look
through the past to the prospective, and
it is natural also for the object to assume
a tinge from the medium through which
^ it is viewed, but because it is an axiom
that like causes produce like effects; so
the means which have done so much for
agriculture, being continued in operation,
** ~~ ? It vol r\n morn.
II is lair 10 prcsuiiirj ??..
And that the same agency will continue
to operate, we may the more safely judge,
because the nearer we look to the present,
the more we see its ctrects. Thus we
know that since the commencement of
the present century, our produce has in.
creased faster than our population. Between
1300 and 1820, this is evident,
but it is more so from 1320 to the present
time. Thus, even Mr. Mncculloch says,
** The price of wheat in England, at an
average of the ten years ending with 1320,
wasnoless than 83,?. 6:1. per quarter: its
average price has since, as we have just
seen, been reduced to 58s. 11J/. per
quarter; and yet, notwithstanding this tremendous
fall, a most extraordinary improvement
has taken place in agriculture
since 1820, so much so, that we now -provide
for ail additional poputa'ioi
not only without any increase, hut with
a very considerable diminution of imporla
/ton."
If we look, however, from 1880 to 1810,
" -I- ?!., mwr-ilinn r?t
we sun see mure tic.mv w.w ?
of the spirit of progression; and in
the individual nnd united efforts ol
the agriculturists, in fostering every
germ of improvement, at this present
moment, we have a still surer evidence
that it is not yet inoperative. If we
know, then, that the wheel of improvement
has had an impetus, and that impetus
has kept increasing up to the present
time, may we not conclude that it wil
not vet stop?
But there is another consideration
which induces us to picture bright pros
gjp pects for agriculture. The progres"
which has been lately made has not beer
a progress or extension of the practice
merely, but an extension of the know ledgi
of the science of agriculture; for if \v<
look to the 20 years preceding 1820, w<
ahull find that 167? enclosure hills wen
passed, and that 3,069,910 acres of Ian;
u-Arp hroupht into cultivation, while ii
" v'^ w o
the ten years after 1620 only ISO wicio
In 1837, the manor farm at rlawstead, 'Suf
o&) produced on 66 acres only S62 bushels c
wheat, or not quite 8? bushels per acre. Tct
average of England it now 24 bushels per a-h
According to tke same authority, (Cullum's Haw
lead,) 20 aervt ol barley returned JO crt -1 bu?i
rie.
sure hills were passed, and 340,380 acres
reclaimed; and yet it is a remarkable fact
that the necessities of life were more
plentiful in the latter period than in the
former.
The advance, therefore, that has been 1
made is an advance that cannot be forgot, i
ten. It is an achievement of mind over j
the mysteries of matter; and now, that the |
fruit of the conquest is tasted, it will in. J
cite to other and more extensive exploits. ,
But while the past peformances and j
present principles of agriculture entitle j
us to hold out such prospects, and to
j anticipate. with a hope amounting to (
1 I I
1) V mi: >11111 ii iiuiiiu i
the farmer's produce to n rate lower than
he can afford, lias a tendency to mar, in
some degree, the present prospects of
English agriculture, and to check that
spirit of improvement that has already secured
to England, along with its fast increasing
population, a still faster increas;
inS production of the necessaries of life ;
{ and this attained, it is said, that population
I is the measure's of a nations prosperity ;
without it the index of lis ruin.
This, then, is the cloud which, by
threatening the future condition of agriculture,
throws a partial gloom over its
i present prospects. We say a partial
1 gloom, because we have everv a<s iranee
: that it will soon pass away. The reasons
I adduced at the commencement of that
1 portion of our subject, incline us to believe
that bright prospects have yet to bo realized
; and a knowledge of the position
which the friends of agriculture hold in
the country, the exertions which they
have made to promote its improvement,
j and their knowledge of its importance ns
. i a national interest, convinces us that this
j cloud will not he permitted to destroy
t j them. Had this heavy blow and great
1 discouragement been contemplated before
English agriculture had assumed its prei
sent standing, as a science, it might.per
haps, have been carried into effect. It
? never can now. Ignorance and apathy
1 are no longer the characteristics of the
i guardians of the j-oil. The lamps ofsci
i once shed their light over the once dreary
3 waste,and in it the s'atesinan sows the
3 seeds of naliona! independence and prose
! perilv* and the philosopher finds food for
1 the mind ; and it will not be made the
i subject of an experiment. Never will
- such a great interest he risked for the
sake of trying a novel theory.
f. I This then assumed, what a field opens
?f to our view. By developing tho same
spirit of progress which actuates modern
e science, agriculture* hasbeeome identified
r. j in principle, and consequently equally
i. j identified in progress with it. Moved, then,
j by thesp'rit, and directed by tho pioneers
conviction, that they win he gioriousiy
realized, \vc must not forget that the
* O
brightest o!>ject has a shadow. So, it is
our duty to notice that even now a cloud
hangs about the horizon, which, by threatening
the glory of the day, throws n
partial gloom over the brightness of the
morning of these prospects. Thus, with
a full knowledge of what has been done,
and what may yet be done, if he ho per
mitted to use the same means, the Knglish
farmer is, ?t the present time repressed in
his exertions by a fear which is not without
somo foundation. The immense
efforts made by a certain class to deprive
him of the protection, on the faith of
which he has buried his capital in the
improvement of the soil, is this foundation.
It is notour object to discuss the
merits, or the dements of the free trade
theory ; so fur, however, ns it interferes
with the prospects of agriculture, as faithfuI
chroniclers, we must allude to it. And
thfit it should in some decree mar these
" D
prospects is not strange, when it is considered
that the declared object of the
theory is to reduce the price of the
English farmer's products to a level
witn those of the continent, and the declared
(vide Lord John Russell's speech)
that two or three millions of acres of
land must go out of cultivation ; and according
to Lord Spencer, that even the
good land would go out of corn cultivation,
and be converted into pasturage.
Knowing, then, these designs, knowing
too, that in his present situation in society,
with heavily taxed soils, and with
dear labor, he cannot compete with the
produce of the untaxed soil and cheap labor
of the continent; and that the land
upon which he has invested the must capita!
in improvements or in tillage, must
suffer first, because the interest of this
capital has to he repaid by the increased
crop, and because the management of
such soils are the most expensive (as na I
tural deficiencies cannot be supplied artificially
without expense.) Knowing, we
say, this, is it possible for l.itn, at the present
time not to fuel misgivings, to hesitate,
and often to finally relinquish those
improvements which, Were he sure of
reaping a fair return for his capital, he
would undertake?
Whether or not it !>e proper national
policy to experiment with such a great
important interest, and to produce so
much certain evil for an uncertain good ;
whether or not it he justice to unroof one
house to repair another ; and whether or
not Mr. Van Buren's opinion, that " noth
ing can compensate a nation for a dependence
upon others for the bread they eatf
be a fallacious one, I leave. Thus much,
however, we are compelled to say, that
the very agitation of the question, and ;
the possibility of a measure being passed
. I f /x-.i.lo f..rA icnnl/i rprlu^p
or to promulgate the truth that practical
observation or scientific knowledge
may have taught him. For
much that is known has yet to be
applied to practice. Thus geology has
given us a key to tho formation, nature
and properties of soils, and their base*;
and affords us, as is evidenced by Sir J.
V. Johnson, [Jour, of the R. Agr. Soc. of
England, vol. 1, p. 273.) such practical
results, as. ' 1. The knowledge of apply,
ing lime.; 2. Laying down fields to advantage
to grass, and when and how to plant
wheat ; 3. What trees to plant in each
stratum."
Chemical analysis, too, supplies us with
the relative proportions of the constituents
of the soil, and shows U9 what clement or
earth it i9 deficient in. Geology again
teaches us where that element is found ;
yet how seldom do we find this method of
improving the soil resorted to, although
Davv long since made known that 44 the
m O
best natural soils are those of which the
materials have been derived froin different
strata, which have been minutely divided
by air and water, and are intimately
blended together; and in improving
soils artificially, the farmer cannot do better
than imitate the process of nature.
The materials necessary for the purpose
are seldom far distant; coarse sand is often
found immediately on chalk, and beds of
sand and gravel are commonly below
clay. The labor ot improving me lexuire
is repaid by a great permanent advantage;
and capital laid out in this way secures
for ever the productiveness, and consequently
the value of the land." (Lecturo,
p. 204.) Although, too, we arc aware,
from the writings of agricultural chemists,
of the high value of liquid manure?that,
in fact, 1 lb. of urine will produce one
lb. of wheat, how seldom do we see it pre.
served at all. A writer in the Prize Essays
of the Highland Agricultural Society of
Scotland, (Quarterly Journal of Agr. for
this month, Dec. 1641,) calculates that
as much is lost as would, if applied, have
an effect equal to the whole of the lime,
rape dust and bones which arc commonly
used.
By the amateur agriculturist, and in
this class we include statesmen and every
[one who is a fanner by choice, much is
i required. By him, an example should
I be set, in the adoption of all improvements,
and |the support of the means
which are publickly proposed for the encouragement
of agriculture, and every
facility afforded to the tenant to follow
in his wake. Adopting this principle,
there is one change in his power to make
which will tenu lo stimulate tne impiu?e- ;
men! more than nnv other. This is, a ;
change from the present tonant-at-will j
system of letting farms, to the sort-lea.se
plan, with a corn rent, "depending on the
marketable price of the produce." The
advantages resulting from this would be,
1st. A tenant with capital equal to his
farm ; for ho would never think of taking
it, as is often the case, now, till he met
with a better, and after robbing it, or it
robbing him, for a few years, leave it for
another lo experiment upon; but, as his
i engagement would bo one of some dura:
lion, ne would consider well before he
bargained, and after, he would endeavor
I to make the best of it.
2d. As the only way to make the best
of it would be by good management, he
would lay his capital our freely, being
01 ,ra his tmore, and consequently of
fJ'W ?
I of science, who can point out an end to its
I progress or say, "thus far" to its prospects ?
Before the philosophic mind, whatever
may be its favorite sphere of action, there
; is ample fooJ. In animal and vegetable
i physiology, in the formation, classification,
constitution, and fertilizationofsoils,
and in the elucidation of, and the supplying
the wants of vegetation, much has already
been accomplished; but cur best
guarantee that much will yet be done is
the fact that much wants doing.
For instance, wo know the structure
and peculiarities of vegetables, the chemical
constitution and mechanical process
of vegetation; but wo are ignorant of the
elements of vitality. We know that certain
soils are more fertile than others; wetcan
trace the constituent elements of
each, and discover external or mechanical
causps influencing the fertility, but of the
essential principle of nutrition?the elixir
vitce?or of the combination best adapted
to the wants of the vegetable life, we can
hp *aid to know the Ions*. We
J " - - --- may
apply this ignorance to a single so I,
how much, then, has to be accomplished
before it be removed in toto.
We know something of the uses of ani.
mnl and vegetable manures; hut how can
we know their proper economy till the
mystery of vegetation is more clearly
developed, and the constituents and conditions
best adapted to special cases ascertained.
Much, in fact, has yet to be
developed before the essential elements of
the soil; the operation of each constituent,
the operation of various manures, and the
effects, mechanical and chemical produced
by certain crops, are clear to us; yet
these must be known before agriculture
reaches its fair and legitimate standing as
a science, and before we can produce the
conditions most essential to fertility.
To the practicalist are duties no Ie9s
urgent. It is for him to banish from his
?
vocabulary the word best; to think nothing
good because it is old, and nothing
worthless because it is new, but to lend an
observing eye to its proof, and toendeav
reaping the benefit of his improvements.
And this is not the case under the year to
year plan. A landlord may be ever so liberal,
and the tent may have great confidence
in him; still he is human and (
may err, he is a man and will die ; then |
who can speak as to the consequences? i
The prudent man, thereforo, is content to J
mane such reforms in his farm as will be J
of immediate benefit, and to use his capital
in a manner thai it is always at his com- J
mand. This is the general rule?of {
course there are exceptions.
3d. He would be partially preserved (
from the pressure of the times, as his rent :
would settle with the price of the grain. c
4th. If from the above security to ten.
ure springs a liberal use of capital, and
from the security against bad times a s
more equable condition to the farmer, the j
general result must bo on equal improve, c
ment in the condition of agriculture itself. 1
All these heads might be illustrated by
many practical cases. The agriculture *
of Scotland, where the system ?s largely j
employed ; has made a most wonderful t
progress in the face of every disadvantage ^
of soil, climate and locality. And we t
can have no better proof of the value of ?
thissvsteiu, than that afforded by the evi. 1
dence of the Scottish farmers, given be- 1
fore a committee of the House of Corn
n -i * i - - *
mons in ieav. r rom tnis eviaence we ,
are told that the great improvement made ;
in the agriculture of the Lothiana, during f
late years, is owing to the adoption of the i
system of leasing, upon n rent regulated 1
l?y the price of corn ; that the improve- 1
ments made by them, individually. on [
their farms, would not have been made, ^
had they not had such leases; that in the \
low seasons of 1834-35, &c. they were ]
preserved from much injury by the reduc- j
tion of their rents, which fell immediately '
with the price of corn. The evidence of !
one of our first agriculturists, Mr. John
F.llrnan, corroborates these facts. And (
wherever the system has been fairly tried ,
in England, its results are equally favorable j
to the improvement of the soil. I
Several English landlords have already <
adopted a measure so fraught with benefit 1
to the whole community, and which tends ^
to increase the production, and consequently
to decrease the price of food. The ,
Earl of Leicester's estates are already a <
striking example of such results from such
an agency.
These then are a few, out of the many
steps which have to be taken in the march '
of improvement. And though some of
- J i J:a: I.:
them may be encompassed Dy ciimcumcs, ,
which it appears impossible to overcome ; i
they arc, as we have said, so far from be- i
ing dark spots in the prospects of agri- '
culture, our best guarantee of thei? being I
realized. They are, in fact, the golJen
apples which will tempt the inquiring mind,
further and further forward in the j j
race of research ; they are incentives to j t
that observation and spirit of investigation
to which agriculture owes so much, '
and they must be useful. Without in- 1
centive man is powerless, with it he may 1
perform wonders; but he must do much.
For, if the mind once seeks, it must find ;
something; and it may he something of
more value than that which was originally
sought for. Thus, to the vain search
after the philosopher's stone, we owe the
discovery of many chemical truths; and, to
the equally futile attempts at perpetual
motion, we are indebted for much that is
ingenious and useful in mechanism.
An apple'a fall, thus led th?? toarehing eye,
To the deep mine of rich discovery."
But there is another inlet, through
which I seeaptospect of some agricultural
knowledge, shining upon England.
The Chinese war, will, I hope, open this
door. How, will not require much explanation.
The present war is not an
opium war. As the Hon. John Quincy
Adams proves, (in his admirable lecture on
that part of the law of nations which applies i
to the existing war between Great Britain
and China.?(Boston Notion, Dec.?4th.)
The cause of the war is the Ko-ton ! the
arrogant and insupportable pretensions of j
* *1 1 1 1 ? ?- n 1 Into j
China, that stic win noiu cuinniMuiai ,
course with the rest of mankind, not upon j
terms ofequal reciprocity, but upon the insulting,
and degrading forms of relation between
lord and vassal." England will bear this no
longer; the final instructions to the plenipotentiary,
demands that future intercourse shall
be carried on upon terms of equality, and according
to the forms which regulate the commerce
of other nations; imposts and restric.
lions upon certain articles, being, of course at
j the optton of each party. That England will j
compel the abandonment of what Mr. Adams, |
tenns 44 an enormous outrage upon the rights
of human natuie, and the first principles of the
rights of nations." is not a question of ability,
(I think.) but of will. And that she has
the will her present preparations showMoreover,
she must now have a trade upon
fair terms, or no trade; as she ha6gone 60 far
that the Chinese, if not forced, will not trade
| at all. That they will be compelled to bow
to the laws of civilized nations, there is no
doubt. England will have the credit, and ali j
I the world the benefit, of having taught a lesson !
of humility to, and of having laid the foundation
of the future civilization of a people whose
vanity and ignorance has hitherto induced
; them to consider China, the very heart of the
! universe.
This accomplished, and agriculture must'
i benefit from it; for though they are so exclu!
fiive and iemorant. universally speaking, every
I ""
author allows that their practical agriculture
I is the most perfect in the world. Let, then,
i an intercourse upon equal terms, be fairly established
with such a people, and there will
soon be a barter of knowledge, as well as of
goods. By having made every art, an experi1
mental one, a thousand years ago, without
th* aid of scientific principles, China has made
many brilliant discoveries. It ?s, therefore, j
fair to presume, that if we carry principles, she ,
will give us in return, some facts, and amongst
the rest some agricultural ones.
Surh. thpn. ia a hripfcxlanr#* at the nrrnrress
" ? " &? r"'5*w?
of English agriculture, and at the prospects
based upon i:. That such a foundation warrants
such a superstructure, we have fully j
>hown. And our v;ew of it, depends upon no
imited examination or partial deductions,
rhc movement that has been made, has been j |
l movement of mind, and with the principles [ (
>f philosophy as their lamp, its professors and !
jracticahsts have become students in the store- !
louse of nature. Henceforward, the prospects !
)f agriculture are the prospects of science ; I
ind its future progress, will be the progress <
)f universal knowledge ? I
? * * * * * * ? .
Although writing currento alamo, there is a |
[uestion which I feel inclined to ask, and an- .
iwer, before I close this paper. It is, what
s the American farmer to learn from a
onsideration of the progress and prospects of 1
English agriculture ? s
It was the saying of an ancient author, that j
here never was a book from which something j
jocid, might not be derived, so, in the following (
nanner, this imperfect sketch may not be un
iseful. As the history of one man is t he pro '
ihecy.of another, as his iife is the record of cer- 5
ain principles of conduct tpsted by experience, 1
in i as thatrecord shows what should be adop- i
ed, and what rejected, if we would pursue, the <
jalh of our predecessor ; 6o a ylance at the pro- j
jress. and prospective condition ot English (
tgriculture affords a lesson of instruction to
he Am -rican agriculturist. In that sketch, '
le sees cause and effect developed ; if, there- '
ore, there be aught therein, which is de. '
rable, the cultivation of the same means,
.vi11 produce the s*me result; for science id |
jniversal ; she regardi not tlie ties of kindred |
)r nationality, nor confines her gift9 to the ,
old"' or "new world," provided her demands
which are equally universal and unalterable, 1
ae satisfied. If, ihen, the achievements nt "
English agriculture be worth aiming at, the !
^a*h which hasbeen pursued, is worthy of be- I
ing pursued again; or, in plainer words, h?? I
oresent improved condition of the science in |
England, will incite tne American farmer to
?rnploy the same means to attain the same '
gnd ; and this is the more likely, because A- I
merican agriculture has advantages which I
are peculiar to itself. Thus, in the first place, (
t is not an old practice, and there is con9equently,
no fixed spirit of imitation or custom to l
remove, before advancement can be made.
2d. As this i9 the case, and as tnany of her
farmers are strangers to the country, and to |
prevailing customs, they are compelled to make ,
a practice of observation; lo the adoption of
which, at an early era, China owes her present
agricultural excellence ; and to her obedience,
though late, to the same principle, England
as we have ehown, i? indebted for " the progress
and prospects" of her agriculture.
3d. Having, in many cases brokenfrom fainily
and fatherland associations, these farmers,
must possess some energy of mind, a qualification
which will, at least, teach them M to know
themselves," the first step to knowledge and
induce them to adopt every means of improvement
which is in their power.
4th. The American farmer is generally the
freeholder or owner of the farm he cultivates.
The improvements he makes, are, therefore,
ii? own, without doubt, and his best policy is
o increase the value of his property.
That these influences are in operation at I
he present moment, this volume of transacions,"
is sufficient evidence. It is impossible,
herefore, that a glar.cc at English experience 1
:an he uninteresting or useless. J. U. (

From the Soulh-Wrstern Farmer.
Utica, 10th July, 1842.
Messrs Editors:?I have read with
much pleasure, on the pages of your val- 1
unhle paper, the communication signed
Farmer," on the subject of curing cotton;
and in reply to a previous article of my
own. It is a subject which has hitherto
caused hut little enquiry in Hinds, allho' "
of equal or greater importance than the i
/.aiititpo r?f th? nrticle. or anv other calling
1 u Vl *"w I - / o
the attention of the cotton planter. I i
hcg leave to state that there is not so i
great a difference in our plan as "Far.
mer" supposes, particularly in the picking
and drying process. He suns until the
dew is "dried cut;" I. until the "seed
crack." Now, if the dew be "dried out"
of the ripe cotton, the seed will undoubtedly
be hard. There is however, particularly
in the early part of the season, a
good deal of green cotton that requires j
drying, although but little or no dew J
will have fallen on it, which would
otherwise become blue in colour, although
"Farmer" should move or scatter
it ubout in his house once a day for two
months. By the "din^y red" I had re-| j
ference to the colour given to cotton ;
by the plan pursued by a great
majority of our fanneis, viz: housing
it without any sunning whatever. It >
then "heats," and I have absolutely seen
it smoke.
"Farmer" is certainly well aware that
cotton, allho' as dry as sun could dry it,
will, when thrown into a bulk, go through ;
a sweat. 1 let it sweat, uninterrupted, (
when, not only the dew is dried out of j
the fibre, but the sap out of the green
seed. The vegetable oil is then pure nnd
imparts to the fibre ''softness, toughness,
pliancy," anJ a better color than a steam
of dew, sap and oil combined.
The reason of its being "impossible to
mako fine cotton of that suffered to remain
in tho field for a length of time" is,
[that it injures the body and strength of the
1 fibre, which "Farmer" is w illing t?? allow, i
It also acquires a dingy blue colour?im- I
parted perhaps by the drippings of dow off
I the leaves impregnated by the colouring !

CORNSTALK SUGAR. #
Wc understand that one of our subscribers
living beyond the Mississippi springs
has a fine crop of fifteen acres corn, sown
broadcast, with which he intends to
make the experiment of supplying hi*
plantation with sugar and molasses. We
wish liitn the utmost success, and ^ope
he will let us hear from him. Cf Mr, Ellsworth
and Mr. Webb, in their articles
upon this subject, are correct, of which
we have no reason to doubt, the time is
not far distant when tho sugar plantations
of Louisiana may be turned to some other
business?for every family in the U.
Slates will ho able to manufacture its
own sugar and molasses.

A CHAPTER ON COMPOSTS.
Mr. Storer,? Notwithstanding the
great value in which this kind of manure
is held hy most of the farmers, yet it ia
believed by us that there arc yet many
farmers who do not make a single shovelful
of this Compost manure in a year.?
?To all such we would say, make a beginning
this season, and my word for it
you will never regret it, nor the time
spent in this business, which will add
nnd increase the fertility of your lands.
The business of Compost making is so
well understood by most of the farmers,
that it needs no particular description.
It is made by mixing together rich sods,
wash of the roads, swamps, mud and
muck, sUhlc manure, green weeds, and
all kinds of vegetable matter, with a mix.
turo of lime, ashes, or piaster, as the case
may bo.
We have lor two seasons past made
about forty loads single, oftiiis valuable
manure, and we find it good for every
kind of crop, particularly for a top dressing
for corn and potatoes, meadows, and
the like. Not having sufficient room
in our barn yard for making the Compost
heap, we make it by the road-side, having
a good wall for the back side of the heap.
We then raise it up to the top of the wall,
nnd then, after we have made it of sufficient
width,and length, we turf it up at
the side and the ends. It happens that
we have not a swamp upon our farm, so
that in making our compost we do not
have swamp mud or muck. However, as
a substitute for this, we go into the wood*
and get leaves, and scrape eff one or two
inches off the top of the ground, which togather
w ith the half decayed vegetable
matter, forms some of the best materials
for mixing with the compost heap, that
wo have ever tried. l#imc or ashes

The case of Messrs M. and P. does not
in my opinion settle the question in dispute.
M. might have sold his cotton for
nine cents, P. foi ten?while Messrs. A.
B. and C., farmers pursuing my plan, havo
been on the same day selling theirs for
fifteen.
Now. Messrs. Editors, I was also raised
where a considerable nttcntion was paid
to the quality of cotton. I have also "picksd,
ginned, helped press," drove the horse,
told the cotton, and, "infandum Regina
spent the money. Although I may not
ie so old a planter as "Farmer," nor live
m so long a creek, yet I will bet my bobtail
pony against his sorrel horse, that,
f I should not out-write him, I will next
fail out-sell him in the Now Orleans market.
In conclusion, I will remark that Mr.
Blailock, a gentleman formerly of the
same country with myself, and who, by
he by. is well informed on those things,
nforms ino that I have neglected to menion,
in my last communication, a very
mportant matter in relation to the construction
of the Gin Stands used by my
ather and many others, whose cotton com*
nanded the highest prices, viz: that the rag
cylinder had a diameter of twelve or thirteen
incho> and the brush full twenty}ight,
being much greater than those a
good deal in use throughout this county,
lie thinks a cylinder and brush of thatsize
will make better cotton than the smaller.
Messrs Broomfield dc Woolly of Utica, extensive
Manufacturers of Gin Stands,
think differently, yet are anxious to have
the experiment tried. Certainly, the
next thing of importance to the curing of
:nt(on is the ginning. A few dollars
ipent in repairing the Gin will bo more
than doubly replaced in the difference it)

in the salo of the article would
