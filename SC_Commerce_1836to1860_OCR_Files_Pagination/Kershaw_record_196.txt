LITERARY BULLETIN. .
Charleston, S. C.
IN offering to the patronage of the pnhlio, % new *
literary paper, we are perfectly aware that wo
are but repeating an uft-tried experiment. The result,
however, we would fain believe, will be differ
cut. we are, it is true, conscious of the possession
of no talent or ability superior to that of our predecessors,
but we rely, (perhaps, indeed, with too
much of the ardor of all experiments,) upon the increasing
tasto of the age of literature ; a taste, the
evidence of which is before us in tlio number of periodicals,
engaged solely in its cultivation?in the
lyecuqns, the libraries and academies devoted to science
and learning. Whilst tho North and the
West are thus assidiously employed in the exemplary
task of mental improvement, we Will not sup- |
poso that tho South intends longer to bear the ,
weight of that heavy inemhbus which heretofore j
has whelmed it in an intellectual slumber more ,
lasting and profound than that physical one which ,
erowhile enwrapped the seven sleepers of Kphesus. ,
It is with a hope thus founded, and with an in ,
tenlion if wc cannot win success, at least to deserve ,
it; that notwithstanding the uniform failure of those
who have preceded us, we have ventured to claim j
the patronage and to labor for the applause of the j
puDiic. I he stako shall be played for; how the
gamo is to end, time only can determine. <
Our object will be to render the columns of the
Bulletin both useful and amusing. For this pu.- j
pose, while one portion is devoted to original Essays,
Tales and Poonn. furnished from time to time
by nur correspondents and collaborators, another ,
portion shall be occupied by selected matter culled j
ir -m every spot of interest and instruction, in the j
vast held of literature. 1
The productions of the press shall pass in review |
beforo us, and on every work which merits our (
notice, an impartial criticism shall be bestowed.?
To light literature and to learned scienco shall alike |
be meted their due portion of censure or of praise, ,
and it shall not. be our faults if our patrons do not
know the intrinsic value of every book, (at least in i
onr own opinion) before they begin to read.
He, says Dr. 1< ranklin, who is good at excuses, is
seldom good at any thing else; and the same we (
opine may be said of promises; lest therefore our (
readeis come to som? such conclusion as 'his, we
will, without further ado, make our bow, and leave ,
them in future to judge from our labors whether we
do, or do not, deserve their patror.age.

C4inee the publication of the May number, the de- \
mand for the Ladies' Companion, has been un- j
preccdented and beyond the most sanguine antici|?a- <
dons. At the commencement of the volume an ad* ,
litional numler of copies were printed, which was |
Considered at the time adequate to satisfy all the ,
orders which might be received, and leave a conai- ,
Jerable nurabe. on hand ior-subsequent calls. The ,
publisher is more than gr&iified in stating that the |
whole edition was nearly exhausted before the issu- |
ingofthc seventh number of the volume; and at (
this time nut very few complete sets remain on (
hand, .to supply the numerous orders which are .
doily deceived Irom every section of the U. S. ,
In conscquenee of this great unforseeu increase of
new subscribers, ho has determined to double the <
mim)w>r nf 1 rn 1 iroacinna for tho enhcon00of wdnr<
while he most gratefully appreciates the unprece- ,
dented encouragement extended to the Ladies' Com- ,
panion, and at th<* same lime, he begs to assure the ,
readers of the magazino and the public in general; ,
that it is his ardent resolution to meet it with a cor- ,
respondigg liberality on his part to merit its continuance.

PATENT COTTON DIN.
THIS Gin can be made double, or single. It
made double, they reduce labqr. and gin just
louble, the quantity of cotton over the single cy linler
Gin, no other knd having been in use prevous
;o this patent; and whether single or doable, they
ire found to improve the quality of the cotton, by
more perfectly cleaning it. They can be made to
contain from ?0 to 160 saws in a stand , and whether
imall or large, one hand will be sufficient to attend
Lhem. The Gin* have mechanical feeders and
loppera attached to them, which tree the cottoo
Irotn leave*, trash, dirt, dkc. before it can teach the
taws, and by the thorough hackling operation it
receives front the feeders, which make two revoluttons
to one of the saws, it is almost in a halt
lined state, before it descends to the saw. By a
very simple arrangement of a screw to each set ?|
;aates, on which~the hoppers rest, and through
which the teeth of the feeders pass, they can be
inade to teed slow or last to suit the condition ot
Lhe cotton at the time. When made double, the
taws are placed on two sets of cylinders and turn
upon each other in opposite directions, and are
cleansed by two sets ol brushes that have four revo.
lutions to one of twe saw. The two cylinders can
be detached so as to enable the planter to run one
or both at pleasure, although embraced with feeders,
&c. in one sAnd. The whole is put in operation
with a drum and blind, as in the ordinary Gin, and
may be propelled by horse, steam, or water power.
It may also be propelled by iron running gear.

Dr. A. Jones-?-Sir, In reply to your enquiry,
what I think of your improved Cotton Gin, 1 have
to say, that 1 saw it work on Saturday lho25lh inst.
and was very much pleased with its performance.
The mere fact of its self-feeding, seems to me to
be & very valuable improvement; and besides, the
quality of the cotton, as it comes out of the process,
appeared to rne to be belter and cleaner than
from the common Gins in use, and that it saves
cons.derably in labor. Respectfully, &c.

The Gins ordered will be delivered to the agents,
of planters in any of the sea port towns of the cotton
planting Slates, at the above prices, the agents
paying the freight on the same from New York,
and becoming responsible for !he amount of the Gin.
It is desirable, when planters give orders for Gins,
they should accompany thetn with theif views in
regard to the arrangement of saws, breasts, brushes,
Ac. it is founu they differ in opinion Some
desire saws of larger diameter than others. The
most common size is 9 or 10 inches ; but some wish
them flinches. Some wish 5 or 0 rows of brushes
on nn axle, while others do not want more than 4
at most. Some wish saws with 8 or 9 teeth to the
inch, while others want 10 or 11. With so much
discrepancy, we prefer they should, at the lime of
giving orders, furnish a statement, of their wishes,
and the manufneturerers can fulfil them in every
particular. Where it is left to our discretion, we
shall makethrm on the most modern and approved
plan. An order con be executed, from the time it
and the Gin in that time placed in the hands of Ihe
factor To be in time for the next crop, all orders
ought to be in the hands of the manufacturers by
the first or middle of May; except for plantations
where they are late in commencing to pick or gin
cotton.

Licentiate of Apothecary's Company, Fel|
Tow of Boll Court Society Surgecn to the Royal
, Union Pension Association, Lancaster Place,
I Wnterloo'Bridge, and perpetual pupil of Guy's
{ and St. Thomas's Hospitals, London.
This valuable medicine, the result of twenty
years' experience and unparrallelcd success in tho
extensive and highly respectable practice of tho
proprietor, patronised by the faculty and nubility,
is now introduced to the notice of the American
public, at the earnest solicitation ef a nuinler of
gentlemen of long and high standing in the prolession.
It is hoped, as a preliminary step, to
check the evils and latul ocnsefpif i.ccs arising
from the use of the numeious deleterious nostrums
foisted upon the public by the aid of fabricated
proofs of miraculous cures, and othe r frauds, by a
set of mercenary, unprincidled pretenders, so totally
ignorant ol medical science that it is impossible
the monstrous delusion can any longer go
down with the inteltigeut people of this country.
These pills, mild and agreeable in their nature,
should be kej>t in every family in eases of sudden
illness, for by their prompt administration, elude
ra, cramps, spasms, levers, and other alarming
complaints, which too often prove fatal, may be
j speedily cured or prevented, in fact, all these
i who value gcod health should never le without
j tlieni. They are sold in packets, at TO cents, ?1,
j and i?.2 each, by every respectable druggist, Look)
seller, and vender of medicine in the United States
and the Cnnadas, with copious directions, together
with testimonials of professional ability from the
j following eminent gentlemen: Sir Asllcv Cooper,
' .1. Abernelhy, .las. blur.dell, M. !>.. W. Cork,

all applications for agr r ries must he made.
