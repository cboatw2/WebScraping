Wia. PIc.ENS' SPl.ECH AT SHELBYVILL.
In the several notices which we have
beretofore published in the form of letters
and communications, tonching the late
greatdemocratic mass ieeing at.Bhelby
ville, Bedford county-no report, not even
the substances ofihe speeches, made by
the distingished guests from other States
who were present on the occasion, have
been given. Among other prominent
citizens from abroad who were present by
invitation, the Hion. F. v. PIcKxEs. of
6South. Garolinla. may' be mentioned as
one who.signally distinguished himself by
4he eloquence, power, force, argument and
ability of the address which he delivered
to'the vast assembly of people w ho were
collected together as attentive auditors on
the occasion. A friend has had the kind
niess to prepare from his notes, taken on
the spot, the following outline of Mr.
Pickens' remarks on two of the subjects
which he discussed-Annexation, and the
slanderous charge of lisunion, broughi by
Mr. Clay and his factious followers against
the Southern and Southiestern democra
cy. The subjects of the tariff, distribn
tion, bank, assumption of State debts, &c.,
were all haudled by Mr. Pickens with that
force, clearness, argument and truth,
which has given him so distinguished a
reputation as a statesman, both in Con
gress and before the people. After dis-.
cussing these subjects, he took tilp the sub
jects of Annexation and Disunion, and the
following is the report of our friend-on
the-accuraet of which we have the most
implicit reliance-of the suidance of what
he said of those subjects. H e sets the
policy of Annexation in its true light, and
re pels the slanderotas charge of. disunion
with the force anid dignity becoming~a
southern statesman and patriot.
* SPEECH.
Of the Hon F. WV. PtcKEsss, of South
Carolina, being the substance of so much
of his address before the Democratic
itss Meeting of the citizens of Tennes
see, at Shelbyville, Bedford county, in
this State, on the 26th day of August
1844, as related to the subjects of An
nexation of Texas to the United Slates,
ani the- charge of Disunion.
M~r. Pickens said, the question of the
annexation of Texas next claimed his at
tention. 'He considered it not as a party or
sectional question, but as a national one in
all its aspiects, There is no class 'of oui
citIzens, not a portion of this glorious
Republic, whose htappiness, and interests
will not- be promoted by its accomplish
ment. -The North, South, East and W~est
are all interested in it-he considered it s in
fluence on the commerce and mattufactures
of the. country, as affording a great aud
growing market foroursorplus productions;
Jne military point of viewv, it would af
foi-d a protection to the country at its most
ininerable points, and increased security
to the domestic; iristitutions of the South;
-that-i't would be the insans of consolidat
ing the Unrionr, and extending the bies
sings of free, overnmieit and liberal insti
HI enat itito a history of the country
6:iferring'io the solemn . obligations, con
rained in the treaty-of 1803, to the govern
ment of France and the people of Texas,
that-as soon as -possible they shoutd lbe in
*corporated into: the Union, and in the
ineati time,-be pi-otected in the enjoyment
of their property,; -liberty and religion ;
6nt that these had been violated in the
surrender of the country to a foreig'n and
d'esnoti6. government, without their con
seint-detailed the history of its great strng
toe for liberty and independetce, and its
glortoaisconsummation Otn the field of San
Jacinto.: -In a con.clnsive arguimentL and
by an-.appeal to-the. established laws of
nattons, he establishidr the right of Texas
as the rightful goverinnent dejure as well
as de facto-the doctriaes wihieb denied
that the government of Texas, founded as
it was upon the will of the people; was.a
'---rghfutaovernrinett, had never beets. re
*'b onizred on the American continent ;-that
-the strdggle of that gallant people- was
cwasifated by the principles of eur own
revolmiish8ay siruggle, and that Texcas
h avfiitegeght long years maintained its
indepe daneiexico had lost her claims,
* nd no.er - pwei- could lawfully in
- hfr-o- i Unton.
He quoted. Sfr'C1lay e letter-on the
jiubject, and answer ' leng 4~ the argtu
~ment, that -it wouhe justcaus ror~ war
ionstuaw with his course in 1824 and in
1827, when, as Secretary. under Mr. Ad
airs, he attempted to buy it, and drow a
parallel between the circumstances then
and now. Then, Spain. to whom our
Government in 1820 ceded it, had not only
refused to acknowledge the independence
of Mexico, but was actually prosecuting a
vigorous and energetic war against her.
Now, Saia Anna, at the time of his inglo
rius defeat, had pleged himself never more
to wage war with Texas. Since that pe
riod no army has ever entered the territo
ry ; not a hostile foot treads the soil of
Texas. Texas had freguently challenged
her eneny to the arbitrement of battle,
but i: had never been accepted ; and no
intilligent man believes that she could
ever be subjugated. He took a rapid
view of the consequences that would re
sult in the event of its falling into the
hands of England or commercial treaties
being forned between them; exposed the
policy of England, as disclosed in the
speech of Lord Brougham in the British
Parliament. and showed- that she was
triking a blow at the institution. of slave
rysaid-the peace and independence of
this 'country. In contection with this
branch of the subject, - he read from a
spcech delivbeed recently by Mr. Vesb
ster, at S'riel J. in which he made a
irect e abolitionists of the
north to 'rally against Mr. Polk, on the
ground that'annexation would surely fol.
low, and of fits'conneetion with slavery;
showed that there as . a party in this
country acting in concert with the govern.
ment.of England, in their unholy crusade
upon the rights of. the South, and the
peace and safety of the Icountry, and their
designs were one and .thesame.
It was in this connectioli that he Alluded
to the cry of Disimion jhai had been made
by the federal party' from one end of the
country to the other, forthe purpose of
averting uttenition from"'their own. unholy
cnd traitorous designs. Asato nhat whip
stcr editors might say, or travelling dema
gogues might echo, for vile partizan pur
poses. he would not condescend to notice
them. But the head and leader of the
whig party had thought proper recently to
embody the sentiment in a letter, and he
would notice him. 'Mr. Clay had, not
long since, travelled through South Caro
olina, he had sliare I tthe hospitality
of its citizens, and received that dis
tinguished attlention due to his emineut
character-But after this, lie no sooner
reaches honie, han he, thinks proper to
caterto. the base 'appetite of party, by
charging upon the people of South Caro
lina what'he knows to he a slander. If
it was holy zeal for the Union that promp
ted him to denounce South Carolina,
where ivas his exuberant patrioutism when
John-Q. Adams, in 1842, actually pre
sented to the American Congress resolu
tions to dissolve the Union? Why did tie
pass by the ressolutions of Massuchusetts
declaritg the Union dissolved if Texas
were annexrd ? Why leave unnoticed
the resolutions 'of Vermont, making the
same declaration ? The reason was ob
vious.-They were his bosom frien's,
Between him and Mr. Adams, there i s
a tie as indissoluble as that which conne
ted the Siamese twins-a s'eparation
would be a political death to both, as every
one knew there had been a question of
of adjourned veracity between them since
the treaty of Ghent ; and the secret tran
sactions of 1825 were yet to be deyeloped
-when, by a reckless and pruffigate bar
gain, they seized upon the power of the
government in defiance of the popular
will, and trampled ttpon the great prnei
piles of re publican libprty. 'But because
South Carolina does not choose to vote
for Henry Clay,.a man wvho has made
open w'ar upon her interests for 20 years,
then, forsuot h ! she is to he denounced f'or
Disuuion. Disloyalty to his person is
disairetion to the Union I No-lie took the
recent letter of M tlay, contaitnitng the
itnfamous charge a~ nst South Carolina,
and trampled it beneath his feet into the
dust, with that acorn and contempt duet
its vile demagogueism ; and thoee whot
choose to he his servile and sycophaiitic
followers take that and make the most of
it.-The truth was, the federal party by
rejecting the treaty of' annexation, know
thut they have struck a blow at the peace
and permanent independence ofthis Uni
on, and cowered beneath the power and
policy of England, and to avoId the just
indignation of a betrayed people, they have
the hardihood to charge upon South Car
olina a wish to dissolve the Uniou. ^It
may be true, that in a portion of'the State
a few of her citizens, under a deep end
biurninig senise of the wrotngs that has been
inflicted en the South by the unwise ac
tion of the Government, and the course
pursued by the abolimiionists and the whig
party in reference to the -Texas question,
may have- manifested some excitement,
but that was confined to a few ; and lie
would say that no where was Union cher
ished with greater fidelity than by a major
imy of the pieoplle of S. C. For himself,,
le appealed to his Maker for the truth of
the assertion, that a distmion of this glari
ous confed pracy never entered into his in
agination. He would refer to a scen~e
that Itranspired in the Congress of the
UJnion, in 1837, of' whi'ch lie had" been
reminded since he .came to the ground,
by a- gentleman riow present, and who
heard it. WVhen Mr. Adams, in his phutee
declared that he'."would glory in'the day
and hour when a dissolution of this Union
would take place, if Texas were annexed
to this country as a slave-State," he arose
and replied that- he gloried that stchba
sentiment had never been utredi by any
Southern man, and rebukedl it 48 un'wvor

In order to refresh the memories .of som
of our readers, we-make the following e
tracts from the proceedings of the Democr-d
State Convention, which assemilld at Colu I
bia, on the 22d or May 1843. These extr ts
contain the doctrines of Mr. Calhoun with e
gard to certain great and engrossinr qest' ns
of the day. These doctrines are identical ith
those of the Democratic Party of South ,ro.
lina. Mr. Calhoun, it will be rememb ed,
was a candidate for the Presidency at the Ime
this Convention assembled.
" And finally, may we not ask, wit out
being thought to disparage the just mgrits
of other candidates for the Presideiey,
wbich one of them do his past history*nd
opinions more thoroughly identify wit all
the great articles of the Democratic c ed
than Mr. Calhoun? He, as far bac as
1834. discountenanced 'he connexio.-of
the Government with banks; and wheri in
1837, that connexion was broken assunder,
he - was amongst the first to advocate the
necessity lor the separation-to plant his
foot, without fear of consequences, boldly
in the front; and under denunciations add
obloquy unexampled for their bitternessin
political warfare, to take tip this great
measure of reform, and by the force of hts

in reference to our political troubles, nud the

Turnips.-We were presented last week,
by Maj. J. H. Hughes, with two large, fine Tur
nips, averaging two pounds each. We have in
past years seen larger and heavier ones, but we
think they will be hard to beat this seaston, as
all vegetation suffered very much from the
drought during the months of July, Auguil
and September.
The weather.-We should have stated in our
last, that after suffering conaiderably from dry
weather for some time past, a fine raid fell on
Monday the 15th inst. Several cool and cloudy
days eucceeded, and then the sun broke ,ut,
and we had warm. delightful weather. With
such a balmy, delicious temperature, as we have
had, existence in a real pleasure.7.
We have published on our first page, the let
ter of General Hamilton to- Mr. Webster.
Doubtless. its perusal will afford a rich treat to
many of-our readers, as it has to ourselves.-'
We call the attention of our readers to the
communication of --Justice" which we have
copied from the Hamburg Republican. 'We
recently published a letter writien at Shel.
byville, Tennessee, giving an account of a
speech delivered by Col. F. W. Pickens, at
