IT is with great pleasure the subscriber informs 1
the public that lie Ims completed the mixture ol i
the VEGETABLE ELIXIR. This medicine is
composed of Roots which grow in this State, li is
useless to enter into a detail of the value of this Medicine,
(or any other Root medicine,) as it is well
known that am. Roots have valuable Medical pro}
initios. lie would also state that then- is not the
cast danger in the use of the Ei.ixir. For the following
named diseases, there is no medicine made or
vended at the present time, better calculated to relieve
the allliutrd, than the Vkubtabi.f. Ei.ixih.
For Itneumatisin and Consumption, the Euxnt
should he used inUM^ly and externally.
For nyspepsiJj^H^VBtiry, he would also recommend
the nso offflPEr. t x t it, as he feels confident J
it will prove highly beneficial to those who use- it. #
To those who are nfHcted with Pustules, Eruptive |
1 tintcmpers, ami Venereal diseases, he particularly!
recommends the use of the VMSCTABLlii ELIXIR. ]
Without the fear of contradiction, he recommends this
Medicine as the iskut now in use?as it has proved j
successful in every case in which it has been used.
Orders addiesscd to the subserilicr or Mr. J. R. I

From the general embarrassment of the times ;

he difficulties attending the disposal of Bunk Bills Er
iiit of their immediate circles ol issue, we have
>e*en solicited by agents and Venders i;? postpone
lie drawing of the above scheme, for a sliori !ime, rpt
mtil the present crisis in the affairs of the coun- 1
ry shall have passed a > ny.
We have therefore yielded to these solicitations !
ind postpone the drawing ol the Alexandria Lotlo v,

if September next, when the drawing will posi- j
ivoly take place.
Adventurers having purchased tickets in said

I rawing, can have their money returned by the
ujent 01 broker from whom they purchased?or can
exchange them for tickets in classes to be drawn
it an earlier day, as it may suit their pleasure.
The Managers have consented to this postpone
inent with extreme reluctance, as it has always }VI
been their policy to draw every scheme at the lime 111

VEGETABLE PANACEA.
THE subscriber informs the public, that he has
just completed tho mixture of this valuable medicine.
He takes pleasure in stating that he has
made use of this PANACEA, successfully in a case
of Scrofula, which he has been afflicted with moro
than threes years. On Several occasions he applied
to practical Physician* for aid, (flfcmh and South,)
and received no benefit. He was, at length, prevailed
upon by numerous acquaintances, to try the
virtuo of certain ROOTS and HERBS; and believing,
that the Receipt would greatly benofit him,
lie took It, together with an old French Receipt: from
which is manufactured the VEGETABLE PANACEA.
It is proper here to say, that tho Quality of some,
or a Li. the principal Roots, are well known to tho
Medical Faculty, by whom they arc frequently used.
For Scrofula or King's Evil, Ulcerated Sores,
general diseases of the BLOOD, or the effects of
Mercury ; it has a decided salutary eil'oct.
For Bowei. Complaint he would also recommend
the use of the VEGETABLE ?ANACEA. ChilJren
arc frequently attacked with this complaint:
[ specially when teething. A few doses ol the PANACEA
will check the Bowels, and they becomo regular
again. It has been tried by a great number of
respectable individuals, and pronounced a "certain
jure." He has tried it at tliflerent times in his own
family, and it relieved the child immedintolv.
This Medicine is simple in lis operations; and has
i pleasant taste. i
Give it a trial, and judge its worth.
The subscriber will keep a constant supply of the
Panai ka at the different Drug Stores throughout
lie United States. Orders addressed to the subscri- j
>or, or to Jauies R. M'Kain, will be promptly at- 1
ended to. The PANACEA may always be h&d at

lea used by two sets ol brushes that have four revoitions
to one of twe saw. The two cylinders can
p detached so as to enable the planter to run one
r both at pleasure, although embraced with feeders"
:c. in one stand. The whole is put in operation
ith a drum and band, as in the ordinary Gin. and
lay be propelled by horse, steam, or water power.
L may also be propelled by iron running gear,
'lie torce required to work it, is about the same as
ial necessary to move an equal number of saws in
ic common Gin. This Gin has been put in ,
peralion in New Orleans for two or three weeks,,
nd its success tested in the presence of a large
umber of planters, merchants and others, and
?ceived their general approbation.
Several gentlemen have been so kind as to give
le Patentee their written opinion lespccting the

Dr. A. Jones?Sir, In reply to your enquiry,
dial 1 think of your improved Cotton Gin, 1 have
3 say, that I saw it work on Saturday the 25th inst.
nd was very much pleased with its performance.
""he mere fact of its self-feeding, seems to me to
c a very valuable improvement; and besides, the
u.ility of the cotton, as it comes out of the proess,
appeared to me to be better and cleaner than
rom the common Gins in use, and thai it saves
onsidernbly in labor. Respectfully, &e.
E. D. WHITE. ,

in the Parish of Rapide, Louisiana.

I Dr. A. Jones?Dear Sir, in reply to your note,
I accompanied by a specimen of the cotton, ginned
by your Patent Gin, I beg leave to observe, that it
exhibits a decidt d improvement on the usual process
of ginning ; delivering tiie staple uninjured
and free from linp or trash, clean nml nf
lor ; thereby giving the article an additional value.
These favorable impressions of the advantages of
your Patent Gin, have been confirmed by subsequently
witnessing it in operation. The utility of
the double cylinders and saving of labor, will be
readily perceived and properly appreciated by the
intelligent planter.
Feeling a deep interest in the success of all improvements
tending to benefit the important staples
of our country, I trust that yours will meet with
the encouragement it justly merits.

From Mr. G. Senior, a Machinist of New Orleans.
Dr. A. Jones?Dear Sir, in answer tc your inquiry
of my opinion of your Patent Cotton Gin, I
beg leave to state, that 1 was fifteen years engaged
in the cotton factories of Manchester, England,
and during four years of that time, 1 was
foreman in the house of Messrs. Lewis, Williams
At. Co., and near five years spinner in the house of
Messrs. Sandford Ai Greene. 1 have 6een your
Cotton Gin in operation, and have examined tho
cotton ginned by it, and pronounce it better cleansed,
and the staple less injured, than any cotton
that ever came under my observation. It is completely
ready for the breaker without ihe aid of the
blower, and would, therefore, 6ave the first rr.csin
lnanufpet.iiCtig the article. 1 consider cotton
cleansed by your Gin, would command from one
to two cents on the pound more than the average
crops brought into the Manchester market, and
cleansed by common Gins. Yours, very rcsp'lv.
N. Orleans, March 9, GEORGE SENIOR."

ting up the Carver Gins for planters on ltcd River,

have examined the quality of the cotton produced

a decided improvement, and by ihe aid of
which, the quality of the cotton cleansed nppcars
much improved, over that produced by the common
Gins. Yours Ac. S. BENNE'IT.

It is desirable, when planters give orders for Gins,
they should accompany thcin with their views in
regard to the arrangement of saws, breasts, brushes,
Ac. It is found they differ in opifiion. Sonic
desire saws of larger diameter than others. The
most common size is 9 or 10 inches ; but some wish
them 12 inches. Some wish 5 or 6 rows of brushes
on an axle, while others do not want more than 4
at most. Some wish saws with 8 or 9 teeth to the
