Huskisson, 'had-produred what monopoly '
was always sure to produce?an indiffer- !

.useful zeal which gives life to industry, j
which fosters ingenuity, and which, in j
manufactures, occasions unceasing efforts
to produce the article in the most economteal
form, had been comparatively extin- j
gnished. To the prohibitive system it ;
was to be ascribed, that in silk only, in the I
whole range of manufactures, we were
left behind our neighbors. We have here J
a proof of that chilling and benumbing ,
< fleet which is sure to be produced when j
no genius is called into action, and when
we are rendered indifferent to exertion by
the indolent security derived from restrictive
regulations.' The principle that is
applicable to one art, is applicable toanoth- '
er, and the ' useful zeal which gives life to
industry,' is hardly less necessary to the j
economical production of a quarter of!
wheat, or the rearing and fattening of an
ox, than to the production of good web of
silk." i

FREE TRADE.
Editors of the Commercial Advertiser.
Gentlemen?Of all the party claps of
' the day, it appears to me that no one has
more humbug in it, or is less understood,
than that of free trade.
I wish to call your attention and that ?
of your readers to an editorial piece in ]
the Kvcning Post, with an extract from 1 <
Knglish papers, on the article of silk <
manufactures, in illustration of the advan- j J
tages of free trade, not only to a country, j1
but to the manufacturers themselves.? JI
And as the Journal of Commerce has a ,1
similar, if not the same editorial remarks j 1
and extracts in its columns, it is fair to i
presume that the editors of bo<h paper? j
understand what they are writing about, !
and mean what they say. Silk manti- j
' ??- j..*.. i ! j
laciures now pay a casn uuiy in xjn^niuu j
of thirty per cent.; and do they call that ^
tree trade ? I have known a house in the s
vicinity of St. Paul's church yard, under 1 i
the present rate of duty, exchcquercd for 1
?10,000, on French goods found in their 1
possession, and thev paid it, too, rather
than undergo the ordeal of an investiga- '
tion hy the officers of the government.? ^
The above named editors say, "the silk ^
trade of England has heen one of the c
I
fairest experiments (of the advantages of ^
free trade) that could possibly be made." *
If this is true I do not know what free ?
trade means. I have been an importer t
for more than thirty years, and am tired t
government experiments; believing
that until our government protects and c
encourages its own labor, and supplies the p
?. o^mntry with a circulating medium of \
qfpia! value in every part of it, our mer- ,t
' qqntile interests cannot prosper. I send ft
Von the enclosed from the Journal of Com- -J
merge,*and will thank you toasktheedi- '
lo-s of that paper and of the Evening '
,Post what free trade means in the vocabulary
of the day. J

[The extract from an English paper,
to which our correspondent refers, does l
not convey the idea that there is no pro- (
tcctive duty on imported silk in England, t
as the editor of the Evening Post appears 1
to have supposed. It speaks of free trade
as opposed to monopoly?not to protcc- t
tion. And the-great increase and im- [
provement of the silk manufacture, which
the Post and Journal cite as argument in '
favor of free trade, have grown up under , ,
n protecting duty of 30 per cent, as the 1
editors of those journals may sec hy rcfcrring

Mr. Fill more proceeded. So long as he
had been a member of this House, he said
he had never, prior to this time, felt it his
duty to notice any newspaper articles with
reference to his conduct, or with refer- |
core to the conduct of those connected 1
with him in this House. Nevertheless, j
there had been brought to his notice an
editorial article, pubiisned in a leading ,
Administration paper, printed in New i
York,''the Union/'of the date of Satur- !
day, January 23, 1843, reflecting so !
inucli on the character of tne Committee j
of Ways and .Means, and of this House,
especially that part of this House with j
whom lie usually acted, that he felt it his j
duty to notice it. He would send the ;
paper to the clerk and request him to read

recommended by the Executive; and it {
was further ascertained that it was very i
probable the Commeltco of Ways and
Means would report in favor of the bill
brought forward bv Mr. Gushing. These
? * ^
facts having reached the ears of the leaders
ot the ('lav faction, a caucus was ordered
and holden, and went into operation
the night before the report of the Committee
was made.
"At the opening ?>f the caucus it was
planned that a majority of the Whigs
present, weary of waging a reckless, unprofitable
and infamous opposition to the
people's will, had determined to go forth, j
like men, and sustain the President and j
the Exchequer.
At this stage of the nffair, the leaders
took their stand and commenced a furious
attack on the President and the Adminis- j
tration. and denounced them both: and,
having got up much excitement, they avowed
that if any man, as a Whig, gave
the least countenance to the plan of the
President, he would he a traitor to his
party, and as such should he presented to
his country.
"Still many of the more discreet and
liberal Whigs manifested a disposition to J
sustain the Exchequer and do something
to relievo the cmbarrasmcnts of the nation.
"At this stage of the game a letter from
r c
Mr. Clay was brought forward and read. ,
In that most precious document he urged ,
that it was the duty and the policy of the j
Whigs to defeat the Exchcquor and leave i
the country to suffer. 'Let the people

"?>uch was the substance if not the
fery letter, of the epistle, and it was not ;
iviiliO'Jt its etFoct. A long and an anninafed
debate ensued, and finally the
juestion wag taken by ft yes and noes. It
s not known what was thd effect vote,
nit is known that the minority was yery
trong, nnd that the majority in favor of]
nstructing in caucus the Committee of
tVays and Means to report against the
Exchequer did not exceed four voles.
4,A majority obtained after every thing
ike argumenl, menace, and denunciation
lad been exhaustid and Mr. Clay's white
harlies defeated the Exchequor bill in

mportant standing Committee of the
National Congress, and deprived the naion
of an opportunity of even discussing

he interests, and the future splendor of
he whole nation are involved.
"If the Exchequer bill had not been
lefeatcd by the caucus?if it had been
lerrnittcd to be introduced to Congress,
vhere it legitimately belonged, it would
lave Dassed by the votes of the Democra;y,
aided by those of the supporters of the
Vdministration and the support it would
lave obtained at the hands of the more

inprincipled of the Whigs?on him who,
is Mr. Randolph, of Roanake, fitly and
doquently said, attempted tosustain himself
and his hopes by forming a coalition
jetween the Puritan and the blackleg.
"Let the American people read and see,

Mr. F. said he desired also an article
from the Madisonian of this morning, on
the same subject, to he read.
Mr. Wise interposed on a point of order,
and after sotnc conversation thereon?
The Clerk rend from the Madisonian as
follows:
[From the New Yuri: Corrccpondcnce of the Ma.
disunion.]
44 Nkw York, January 19, 1943.
44 One of the most disgraceful acts that |
ever distinguished a faction occurred at
Washington, a few days prior to the utter- j
ing of the report of the Committee of
Ways and Means in reference to the Exchequer
hill.
4,it is a somewhat roundabout way, to
he sure, to get facts before the public that
transpire at Washington?to send this
from New York to the American Metropolis
,* but, as there are obstacles here in
the wav of free communication, ami as
the fact I wish to get to the world is important,
I send it to you ; and here I state
It.
" The night before the Committee of
Ways and .Means was to report on the
Exchequer bill, n 'caucus' of the Whigs
was helu, and the subject was taken UJ>
for consideration.
"After consultation and debate had
been had, it was found that there was a
strong and determined disposition on the
part of the Whigs to report favorably and
" " * ? I 1
to vote in tavor ot me inn. inucni, mvi?;
was a majority of the caucus in favor of
such an issue, in the midst of this state
of feeling, it was urged by unprincipled
leaders that, if the hill found a favorable
report, and should by any chance be adopted,
it would at once ensure the popularity
of the Administration, and facilitate
the prosp'-ntv of the President. This of
itself, in all probability, would have hern I v
enough to damn the bill, and secure the | c
defeat of the Exchequer scheme ; but oth. j ,|
er aids were called in to consummate the , n
unprincipled baseness of the Whigs. j (l
"To complete the work of iniquity, a .|
letter written, it is said, by Mr. Clay, da. I .
ted at Natchez, in which it was urged |
that Congress ought to linger on till the s
4th of Marc!), do nothing for the country, | v
and thus, by 'applying the screws to the j
whole commerce and business of the na- j 'J
tion, rouse it to indignation towards the I P
President, and thus aid the towering am- I
hition of the Kentucky candidate for the i s
Presidency.' j t
"My sources of information are correct j 0
and authentic, and the facts here stated i a
cannot he denied by the Whigs in Con- s
gress. j h
" Hut for the acts of the Whig caucus ' ^
the Committee of Ways nnd Means would j
have reported the Exchequer bill on the
basis of tlie scheme presented by the Ex- j *
ecutivc ; it would have been taken up in j v
the House, and been adopted by the votes i c
of the Democrats, aided by the liberal M
Whigs." I
The House (continued Mr. Fillmore) tl
would now perceive that grave charges d
were brought against the conduct of the t<
Committee of Ways and Means, in report- 0
ing against the Exchequer. The first
charge contained in the article in the ^
Union, and reiterated in this letter in the _
Mndisonian, was this : tj
" It had been ascertained that a mnjot- ^
ity of the more discreet Whigs were in
favor of the Exchequer scheme recom- c
mended by the Executive ; and it was j
further ascertained that it was very probable
that ?he Committee of Ways and n
Means would report in favor of the bill h
brought forward by Mr. Cushing. Thcso a
facts having reached the cars of the lead- E
crs of the Clay faction, a caucus was or- u
dored and holden, and went into operation h
the night before the report of that com- w
miltoe was made." n
With regard to the single fact stated a
here, Mr. F. desired to say that the report
from the Committee of Ways and Means (j
to this subject was made on Monday morning
; so that if a caucus was held on the .
night preceding that report, by the Whigs,
in reference to this subject, it must have
been held on Sunday evening, and he de- ^
si,"lid to say that no caucus icas holden c'
neither al ih"L or any other lime, to his ( 1c
knowledge, with any *uch object, or when o
any such proceedings took p.'.*ce as is alleged
in this paragraph. Nocomtiiu?,c?~ jj1
tion or information had ever come to his fl<
knowledge [A voice: "Or to the know!- sr
edge of any body."] from any source, j
that a Whiir caucus had been held, at
I
which it was determined what kind of a j 'p
report should be made in this case.
The next charge was as follows :
"At the opening of the caucus it was
plain that a majority of the Whigs prc9enf,
weary of waging a reckless, unprof- r
fitable, and infamous opposition to the , ?l
People's will, had determined to go forth,
Jikc men, and sustain the President and pi
the Exchequer. ^
At this stage of the affair the leaders w
took their stand and commenced a furi- Jl
ous attack on the President and the Ad- j
ministration, and denounced them both; ^
and having got up much excitement, they ^
vowed that if any man, as a Whig, gave jj
the least countenance to the plan of the
President, he would be a traitor to his | ^
party and as such should be presented to di
his country. tc
"Still many of the more discreet and di
liberal Whigs manifested a disposition to ei
sustain the Exchequer, and do something
to relieve the embarrasmcnt of the na- ni
tion."
Mr. F. had only lo 3ay in reference to
that, that he had no knowledge of any S(
such act at any time. He had no belief
in any such thing having taken place, j
If it had he challenged any individual on
this floor to rise and say he knew of it. j ?
The next charge wa?? j ?
"At this stage of the game, a letter, g
froin Mr. Clay was brought forward and c<
read. Ia that most precious document j l-<
he urged that it was the duty and the p
policy of the Whigs to defeat the Ex-1
chequer and leave the country to suffer." k
Then followed (said Mr. F.) what per- | n
ported to be a copy or an extract from ! c
that letter. He had only to say in re. [.
fercncc to it that ho knew not what Mr. !
Clay's sentiments were in reference to (]
this subject j that ho had never heard ,,
I that Mr. Clay had ever written a letter J,
I to any person in reference to this sub[ject;
that no such letter had ever been q
produced or spoken of or alluded to at e
any meeting or caucus of the Whigs or b
ef any other portion of this House that : '
lie had attended, and that the only knowl- j 1
| edge he had in reference to Mr. Clay's js
opinions in regard to this matter was that j ^
I general knowledge which he should infer j 0
* ' c
j from his (Mr. Clay s) character and pub- i
lie conduct, and from no other source !
whatever. \ v
Having denied most unequivocally any (
knowledge of any caucus at which any > ?
part of the proceedings here detailed took f
place, Mr. K could only say, in reference j ji
j to the whole statement here contained, j c
t,':at so far as it related to any action of t
the Whig party of which lie had any j(l
} knowledge, it was unequivocally and also- I 1
! lutcly false?and if there wasanymcin- j
j heron this floor who knew any facts other- | 1
1 1 1 ? "mil fltlf) if I V # * I '
j wise, lie desired mm 10 risu nw?? ....v. n.-- ^
j the House the information.
I: was due to himself and to the com- ^
j miltcc with which lie acted, to say that I y
they had taken lip this subject wholly in- I 'j
dependent of any thing that had taken j |
j jihiee heretofore in tliis House or else* j |
1 where ; and with rcteronco to iiimselfhej j
i i
roulil say, that lie had commenced the c
onsideration of the subject with a strong "
esiro that they might he able to rccom- ''
;iend this subject, or something similar
o it, to the adoption of the House and ?
he country ; and it was only on a full |
nvestigation of the subject, with this deire
on his part, that he had come to the ^
onclusion that lie could not discharge ^
lis duty to the House and to the country, ; 0
ill by recommending the rejection of the s
lan of the President. u
He did not know that his duty tohimclf
or to any other gentleman required a
hat he should snv more. There were
ther members of the committee here,
nd if tlicv had anv knowledge of this |(
J o
ubject beyond his, or different from it, ii
e hoped they would rise anil give that C
nowledge to the House and to the world, n
He was asked (and he had no objections
o stating if it was in order) how long it '(
/as before this report was made that the 0
ommiitee came to the conclusion nt ?
rhich they finally arrived in the report. .
le would say that the committee took up
ho subject and investigated the several t|
ocumcnts carefully, and when they came
a the final result there was no difference jj
f opinion in the committee in reference tl
) it, and that it was at least two weeks, tl
nd nc should think more, before the re- A
ort was made to this House. It was a
ion directed to be drawn up, and time n
'as given for it, and for canvassing it in f<
ominittee, before it was finally submitted f
) the Heuse. 11
If there was any member of the com- ^
littee whose recollection differed from .
is in regard to this thing, or if there was
ny member of this House Whig, or .
democrat, or who belonged to what was (|
sually denominated "the guard," who a
ad any knowledge of facts different from 0
rhat he had now stated, he hoped that a
lemher, whoever he might be, would rise a:
nd state it, that he might have an op- d
ortunity for correction. He had stated re
lie facts as he understood them. h
Mr. Wise inquired if he understood ,(
lat the gentleman from New York (Mr.
'illmore) intended to impute to him (Mr.
P.,) or any other member of what he ^
hoose to call " the guard," any part or
>t in this publication in "the Union" w

The New Orleans Tropic gives the foljwing
narrative of facts which led to the
^position of the fine of $1000, which
ien. Jackson's friends in Congress are
ow seeking to have refunded.
The ever memorable battle of New Orjan.s,
as all know, was fought on the 8th
f January, 1815. That battle was dcisivc
in its character and in its results,
'he troops of Great Britain, flushed with
le hopes of an easy conquest, were do2ated,
driven back in disgrace, leaving
tieir General and the flower of the army
mong the slain. Those who know any.
ling of the history of the times, know
le courage and devotion displayed upon
lat occasion bv all classes of our citizens,
drnost every man capable of bearing
rms shouldered a musket and rushed to
leet the invader, and among those who
lught hardest and bled freest, the
'rench population of the city were emicntly
distinguished. Tousard, the French
,'ounsel at New Orleans, though forbiden
to enlist himself, was most active in
lducing his countrymen, residents of the
ity, to enroll themselves, and with peraps
a few except ions they rallied around

andoncd their families and homes, desrmined
not to lay down their arms while
le foe was within our roach and nobly
id they redeem their pledge. They did
ot retire until our proud invaders were
umbled?until our rivers ran rod with
loir blood, and our fields were covered
ith their slain. But when the enemy
ud been repulsed, and our arms were
orcred with a signal, and so far as we
ere concerned, an almost bloodless vic>ry,
then, nnd then only, they asked for
crmission to retire-? for leave to return

itizens of another country, men who hail

?cmed to be the most natural on3 !n Ihe

F Louisiana?when news of the ratificaon
of the treaty of peace between Great
iritain and our Government had been reeived,
then, and not till then, they asked
hat they were by every consideration
ntitled to, a discharge from further duty!
These applications, the reader will relember,
were made on the 22d day of
'ebruary, and more than a month after the
attic! The first applications for discharge
'ere granted upon the presentation of
certificates of their national character,
igned by Tousard, the French Counsel.
I ready spoken of. The first applicants
'ere readily discharged by General Jack- J
an, but the number increasing more than
o calculated on, he got into a towering
assion, and ordered Tousard to leave the1
ity. Oa the last day of February he i9
led a general order, commanding all
renchmen having Tousard's certificates,
ountersigned bv himself, to retire from

le city to some poini noove uaiuuuim^; i
n addition to this, a list of the names of
II persons who did not leave within three
ays, was directed to be taken.
That so ungracious a return should
avebcen made to the gallant fellows who
ad aided in the defence of the city, very
aturaily, excited a great deal of feeling,
'apers from Washington, announcing the
rrivfll of the treaty, had been received,
nd the order of General Jackson was
onsidered exceedingly harsh and unne- I
essarv. At this stage of the proceedings,
iOuallier, a native of France but a merrier
of the Legislature from Opelousas,
nd one of the most active and efficient
lembers in ail that trying time, wrote
nd published in the Courier, an article
f some length in which he reviewed
reneral Jacksons order with some severty,
and recommende d the persons allued
to, to remain quietly at their homes.

himself that Lounliicr could be tried
y a Military Court Martial as a spy, and
ung up without ceremony. With this
ievv he caused to be published, the seend
section of the rules and articles of
/ar. which denounces the punishment of
cath ngniugt spies! Accompanying this
ection was a notice, that the "city of
sew Orleans arid its environs, being unler
martial law, and several encampments
nd fortifications within its limits, it was
lecmed necessary to give publicity to the
ection for the information of all conccrn:d
!"
This publication was made on the 4th
.* rwl ihft next dav. Sunday, the
M .M... v-.., _
?th, Louallier was arrested and conliried !
Here it was that the trouble common:ed,
and iiere it may not he improper to
idd, that in December previous, the Do;islature
had refused to comply with the
vishes of (ion. Jackson and suspend
he operation of the writ of habeas corpus!
Hi at body wisely determined not to outaw
the citizens of the Stale by depriving
hem of that great bulwak of personal
iberly.
The counsel of Lounllier applied to ^
Judge Hall, of the United States District
Court for a writ of Habeas Corpus, and
, he immediately gave his fiat. Gen. Jackson
at once conceived that ho could try
Judge Hall also before a Court Martial,
and I nng him nnd forthwith he signed a
P O
w.irrant for his arrest and i\ie mittimus for
his imprho went ! Judge Hall was accordingly
arrested at his house that night,
nnd confined in the same room with Louallier
in the barracks! This done anofrr
.1: . _ 1 1 r>i :l . t
it :c:r wis uiNjiiucncd 10 lyiainome, mo
Clerk of the Court, with a demand for
Louallicr's petition, on the buck of which
Judge [lull had made his order, This the
Clerk peremptorily refused to surrender*,
but finally consented to take the document
to (Jen. Jackson. Upon his arrival
nt Gen. Jackson's quarters* he was asked
if it was his intention to serve the writ, to
which he promptly responded, yesf Ha
too was threatened with an arrest* but ho
was not to be moved by menaces from
the discharge of his duty. He had hand*
ed the petition of Louallier to Gen. Jackson
when he entered, and upon retiring,
demanded it* but his demand was treated
with contempt and the paper withheld
from him ! Upon the arrival of Duplessis
the Marshal, who was one of Jackeon'a
volunteer aids* he was asked if he would
servo the writ, and when he ansi^ered ill
the affirmative, he too *as pointed to tbe
proclamation of martial law, and threatened
with arrest.
Dick, the Attorney of the United Stater,
applied to Judge Lewis, ?f one of the
State Courts, for a writ of Habeas Corpus
to release Judge Hall, and the writ was
granted. As soon as Gen. Jackson was
advised of this, he ordered Lewis aod
Dick to be arrested ! and Gen. Arbucic,
who had charge of Judge Halt, refused to
obey Judge Lewis' writ!
This was on the 6th of March, and
Gen. Jackson was morally convinced that
a treaty of peace had been ralijied\ On
the 8th he announced that he had "persuasive
evidence" of the fact, and his first
duty was to discharge the body of the a
militia of the State! ^
When the court martini for the triolof *
Louallicr came on, on the 9ih of March,
he pled want of jurisdiction to all the
specifications, and the Court sustained in*
plea on all the charges, save one, and on
this one, they acquitted t>irr> !
At the tosult of this trial General Jackson
was greatly disappointed nnd mortified,
but he diil not release any of hi*
prisoners! Tno acq ittal of Louallier,
however convinced Gen. Jackson it wotiU!
be useless to try Judge Hall on the same
charge, and on the 11th of March he was
rele. sed from prison, conducted by a guard
several rni'cs beyond the limits of tho
city and order ti not to return ' until the
ratification of the treaty was regularly
; announced, or the British shall havo left
the Southern coast!"
What fol'owed may he1 related in a few
words: On the 13th official information
of the ratification of the treaty was received,
and shortly afterwards Judge Hal!
returned to the city. On the 2lst, the
affidavits of the Clerk of the District
Court, of the Marsh il of the United States,
of the Attorney of Louallicr, and of the
Commander of the Barracks, were laid
before the Judge, and on the motion of
the United States Attorney, n rule to show
cause why process of attachment should
not issue against Jackson, was granted.
The rest is soon told. Gen. Jackson was
brought into Court, nnd for his contempt
of that tribunal fined 81000 and costs!
To show that Gen. Jackson's conduct
in the order to the French population, *
and the imprisonment of Louallicr and
Hall, was wholly unnecessary, it is only
necessary to make an extract from his

of the acts mention'd in the rule took
place after the enemy had retired froin

they had met with a signal defeat?and
after nn unofficial account had been received
of the signature of the treaty."

the oregon bill.
After some, (a very little, and not important,)
incidental business, the bill for
the oceupa'ion and settlement of the Oregon
Territory was taken up again.
Mr. McDuffie, of South Carolina, had
the fioor. He thought there had been
some precipitation in bringing forward
this measure. He hud no doubt of the
title of the United States to the territory,
nt least as far as 49 dog. North latitude.
Hut there arc two parties to this question ;
and (he other pnrty is as confident of its
title as wc arc of ours. And how is this
to be settled? And what is the existing
emergency, to call upon us at this unpropitious
moment to adopt the hostile course
described in this bill, and that, too, after
slumbering over it through long years of
profound peace, and unparalleled prosperity,
when there was no legitimate or illegitimate
mode of expending money, of
which (he government of the time did not
avail itself ?
iMr. McDuffie alluded, wilh strong npprobation,
to the course of the English
Government in the late negotiation, and
~ nr,.flrni Administration for the ad
Ilf I
mirnble treaty which was its hnppv result;
and while all the world were shaking hands
upon this auspicious settlement of our difficultics,
we are now about to assume a
hostile attitude toward the country that
had sent us. so lately, the olive branch of
I peace; we are about, in return for this,
I to Hash in its face the sword of war! Ho
doomed an amicable adjustment much
more worthy of us. nod much more likely
to load to a favorable result. Our title is
clearer than theirs, and a calm and ration.
