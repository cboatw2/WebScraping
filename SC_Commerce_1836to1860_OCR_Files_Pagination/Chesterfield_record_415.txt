Oo the subject of plowing in clover for
wheat, Mr. Cohnan has- the following remurks;
"I have aU'aj's been inclined 10
the belief, which g?*neruliy prevails, and
which Mr. Pinney niaintams, that the higher
the state of luxuriance in which vegetable
matt' r was turned in by the plow, the
more thy l?nd \v II bo enriched by it. ifut
the expci ea?*e of one <rf the best farm -rs
in the state has satisfied inc. especially as it
has been confirmed by anoth' r equally intell
gent farmer, and wholly unbased by
(he judgement of any other person, that
the land is more ben? fi ted by th^ turning
in of the clover crop after it is dri d, titan
when it is in u s'ate of greenness and full
/ ofsap. Tne op'nio.i.s that if green, it creates
an aoidiy in the soil, prejudicial to d.e
ucceeduig crop " , v
In support of the opinion here expressed
by Mr C'?lm ui, we may adduce that of oi e
of the most successful wheat growers in
the-western coun t's, wliose crop is usu. 1
1,000 to 1.500 bushels. He u-s tied us
several y? ars Kiiu*e, that he had done turning

also the clovr the next year, his course
embracing four -years. Large qtnni'iesj
ol clover decay on ;he ground, and this, j
mixed with the manure of the an m*ls, ?nd
the mass of clover roots at the time of fallowing,
gives a progressive improyemcn' to
hs soil and his crops, which certainly
speaks well in favor of the system.
It ap tears from that pari of the report relafing
to manures for wheat, that lime has
be?DofJiitle or no vn!ue when used, and
that crops of w heat of about thirty bushels
per acre, have been grown on soils in which
not a trace or carbonate of lime existed.?
There was a small quantity of pbosphat*
of lime, however, present, one and a half
percent, ant fvis cotild not lu'Vc Uc-n

Witness the discrepancy between ihe nssul s

reason of this want of efficiency in the

faCtorhy ascertained; but the subject is one
of such consequence, as to demand the inos?
rigid investigation. We are inclined to the
opinion, that where the other matters in the
soil are right, a very small quantity of lime
li seffineut for all the purposes of v g i.v

to m?ko five successive crops in the season. t|
After stating what we have done sis sutfi- ^
ci inly as I can, I will now proceed to mak?*
some general observations, which may not 8
bo una cepiuble to y'ouug beginners like
myself, in the fits: place, too much inn h
portauce. in my humble judgment, ctmndt t'
be ascribed to the eggs, the purity of tie- F
s ock from which ihey come, and the proper c<
kei p of iherti. Ifei her b" n"<J cted, no In t|
ing can pr? vent ih?* mischiefs winch will in- 0
siantl^ result. Ot course n >ne who begin g)
tins business will he so imprudent as not to
have leaves enough for their worms, without
stint. If there should be su *h a one, he ,r
must fail. With plenty of food, and good,
sound, well-kepi eggs, it s ems to me that, 0
without ctsualities which no prudence can h
obviate, no one ought to fail.
From first to lasl, through the dampest o
season ever known In this country, we have g
lost no worms from these eggs by dise ase. w
We have never lei w-m leaves if wj could ^
li? lp it; hut there have been many days ^
ihat we have b<e;i obliged to do so, or let
our worms go without food; no iij iry was
observed from it. I hnve gone by the direciiona
of Mr. Gideon B. Smith, of Balti- Sl
more, whenever I have been at l? ss, and b
have found thom tilways ri^ht. My friend at
and relation, Mr. Thomas H;cks, also, has h
visited us frequently, and has always given
us advice and limits which gavo us much
issuance.
By the first opportunity I will send ycju
i sample ol the cocoons, bo h gf the twp
rop n ! I arge sulphur variety; 2612 of life
o'iner, tak^n us ih -y came, after being
I ?gse?l, made a bushel, and aro allowed 1n

Of eou'se it will he desirable to know
low much labor has b en expended in our

imo the woman and boy" would f?e nm' le

iouble that force would bo miffi-* ent?th?ocoons

As soon as I was informed of

Hct-ived from books and persons against

-as a complete failure. Wh:lst I am on this
iil?j"ct, it will not be improper to state, that I (
ave heard of three different instances in this
icinity of worms afflicted with what we call
le yellows, being revived by immersion in
l?1(1 water. (I suppose sprinkling wouhl do
s well, but I beg the advocat sof jhese res?active
creeds not to consider me as taking

irown in the creek, and some bovs nfckod

ave heard, having myselftipen loo much con*
ned to our own, to see much of other people's
jcooneries. In every instance where they
ave u-ed eggs from a bad stock, or of bad
nep, they have fai'ed; and in every instance
here they have had eggs trotn a good stock
'liicli have been well kept, they have succeed,
d. I saw Dr. N W. L^wis yesterday, who
>ld ine that his first crop was a failure f-om
ad eggs, but having procured some good eggs
>r his second crop, he had complete success.
Ir. Hugh L. Percevall informs me that he
btaincd a parcel of egg* from a gpntleman in
iib county, (the one who presented the ladies
-ith the worms above, and some of the sam*
ggs,) in February, and put them on ice; that
e hatched them out in May, and they have
o- e well?no sick ones among thein; a proof
riat if these eggs which have been extensively
sed here, had been put on ice in January or
'ebruary, instead of being kept in a ctliar,
tat all would have succeeded who t sed them,
>r they were from an unquestionably healthy
ock. Knowing that this gentleman had a
irge quantity of eggs from a healthy stock, I
)uk it upon myself once to mention to him
le importance of putting them on* ice, early,
[e remarked that he thought his cellar was
old enough, and, 1 understand, kept thein in
le cellar; and Mr. Pcrcevalls lot is the only
neof *hich I have he^rd, wh;ch has been
jccessful. John L. Wilkins, jr., esq, informs
le that he has had good success, and is feedlg
largely, and is preparing to feed 6n a very
irge scale. He will, no doubt, as well as the
ihes I have named, give to you, and the pub.
c, the benefit of his experiments.
I fear I am taking up too much roonr for j

ive you permission to leave out any part

it for yourself individually.Before
I conclude, however, I beg leave to
ty to all who are going to embark in this
uainess, that after they have provided a full
apply of food, eggs without stint, from a

Charleston, July 13, 1840. ' .
Geu'lemen: i should b? very happy to
accept the invitation I have had the honor
ip receive, to a "Gathering of the People"
of Spotsylvania and some of the udjoiuing
counties, at Fredericksburg, on Friday
(Julv 17) but circumstances forbid it.
Geuih men: On Shis, as on every simi.
iar occasion, great multitudes cannot act
n?ge:h^r without compromise, nnd accommodation
on similar pom's, with a view to
e.irry more important ones. Ye*, in my ^
opinion, thorn is no question likely to take
a practical shape and bo made tho subject
of-'.serious discussions wiihin the next four
yours, on which old pnr y diff-renees will
bo ro.ivod. The opinion of the country
seems to be entirely rnudn up ?is to the ex.
pediency?to say nothing uf the unconsii.

Improvements, accoding to the plans proj'-cted
under Mr. Monroe's \dmiwsT?ii??n

As to tho Abolitionists, mo candid mail will

pa-it conduct furnishes a pledge on which we
m y securely rely?an-i I s u no difference
between the paities in this p'spec'. Tlfe
single issue p.egen'bd by theG<?v?r nnent is
the hard money. syst n?, and t?*e withdrawing
of their depositee from the usee of cornmerep
aiufthe custody of the banks.
* Were '.his measure even diwrable, as its
advocates pretend it is, and as I, f>r one,
ill uk it is very far from being, it would
hi ike no diff icnce at all in my view* of
toe Presidential election. **
Tlwt 'he currency of ?liia country is in a
cond lion that calls for our most serious
attention?rhat It is al ogether one Of tho

solved by science and ex|?er?euce, 1 linve
never intended :o deny ; on the contrary,
it i. because of (Ins very d fliculry noi tm.
portuuce of tire subject tint I probated
against its being made a party question, to
be nmiiuged by demagogues with a view
to one tbe prejutljws of the People,
bsiead o5 b -ing disposed of by stu;ts<n<n
With n vu-w >o their real interests.
Bui they would have it so?**it was ne.

example, among hundreds (wasn't \\?) of
State banks?scores, certainly?with orders

I Th< y got the nation drunk with the spirit
I of speculation, and disturbed, while they .
iniiluplied infinitely, the relations of dob or
and creditor, and tiros" of vendor, incuinhr
incer, and holders of property. No
sooner did they see the terrible consequences
iif this profligate game?not on the
Wnigs, whom they had, however, "gam0101111]"
very completely, but on the properly.

of its industrious classes, and tlmt a. vehement
indignation against the authors of all *

public mind?than they attempted to make
the very banks which they had seduced
the 'scape-goat" of their odium, and were
the first arid the loudest in the cry against
the victims of their own perfidious debauchery.
They had carried their point once by
sending out into the highways to coau
p.-| llie tihnd, the halt, and the lame, to
come in and borrow of their Pet Banks, as
they are called. ?
They now pronounce all trading whatever.
on borrowed capital, fraudulent and

had used the State banks?or
rather abused them?as artillery against
the United States B^rik, assuring their
fr ends that nothing could be infer tlmn
these engines which they w?re loading to the
muzzle, and heating even to burning; and
when, at the close of a victorious action,
they alt burst on their hands?as was, of
course, inevitable?they denounce the
whole system as, even under the best man
agement, detestable, and propose, for a
fanatical, clamorous, party support, one
inconsistent with all our previous habits,
and of the successful opention of which
thePonly guaranty they give is their total
failure in bll their previous KtlWiney. 1

godhs^ad, or indifferent, but, are they fit
to be "Nwl with the management of that
