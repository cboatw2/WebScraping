why the devi i. should be permitted lo run aw a;
with.all the good tunes. Upon o similar ground
we know* 110 reason why tlis Whigs slioni;
monopolize all the enthusiasm in politics, es
pecially when they trade upon so slight a po
Jitical capita!. Hut was it the herd cider or thi
hard cider principle?, that raised t.':e shout??
Did they yell with frantic joy, because a ban!
was to be created, making "the poor poorer
and the Tich richer"?enhancing tlio value o
the wealthy man's lands and houses, loading liii
cellars with rich viands and wines, his dwelling
with costly furniture, and his groaning tables
with massive plate, and tilling the poor man's
pocket with worthless rags, and turning hii
children's bread to stone? Did they bear upon
their bending shoulders broad banners and wn
ving flags inscribed with mottoes of equality
to assist in establishing a scheme of tariff taxa
tion, which robs from the hard-working man's
toil, to pamper idle luxury. It certainly was
the cider?not the principles.
Is there notion? in Democracy to shout for?
ay, and to induce one hearty and ringing p?a!<
rolling up from the very .souls of freemen! A cry
that could fill liberties echoes until the solid eai tli
reeled with the triumphant huzza! Is there no.
thing to warm and excite, arouse and exhilerate
in the glorious reflections that crowd upon tlie
heart of man in its fullness of his fellow man's
rights and prerogatives? There is a unanimity
* of sentiment and feeling growing out of a community
of interest, that makes men move together
with one impulse. They hope alike, fear
alike, enjoy alike and suffer alike. Napoleon
said he marched with the opinions of thirty millions
of men. But he dictated that opinion.?
Democracy marches onward with the spontan
eouB and untaught opinions of every human being
who has a bosom to swell for the privileges
of his fellow mortal. It is confined to no country,
bounded by no limits, and circumscribed by
no clime. Where the heart of man beats
warmly in good will and high with resolute determination
to protect and preserve his race,
there is the music of its forward journey of triumph
through time. That music can never
cease while life lasts, while one instrument ol
the joyous melody remains to cheer and elevate.
Then give it words?give it expression. Let it
Bound through our valleys and rise over our
mountains. Let its spirit appear in the winning
language of poetry and thrill in the deep tones
of eloquence. Let nation cry unto nation, and
let the cry be taken up, and sent echoing back,
until the very heavens shall become vocal with
the harmony, and cease its own melodious notes
in transport at the sound.

Skinning 'Coons?The Globe descants in the
following' amusing manner on the subject of the
recent elections:
We have heard, ever since our boyhood, that
'coon-'Bkins were good in every month having
the letter R in it; and we are led to believe,
from the number of coons which have been skinned
in the several States during the last month,
ami thus far in this, Jhat then-, nnmftJj-MjJi in it.
We ground our belief upon the number of coonskins
the democrats have railed up to dry since
the first of the last month, which we will here
record in the order in which the several skinnings
took place.
The first was in Vermont, on the first. Monday
of last month. There the democrats skinned
^ awhile; but, finding the fur not good, they suffered
the coons to run until next fall.
On the Monday following they commenced in
Maine?which is a little farther north, where
the fur becomes good earlier in the fall?and
there they skinned between fourteen and fifteen
thousand. They skinned so many there, that
they have not been able to count the skins up to
this timeThe
skinnini? commenced in Georgia on the
first Monday in this month, where the democrats
skinned about 3,000. On the Wednesday following,
they skinned about 2,500 in Maryland,
where the owners of the 'coons said they were
1 eo wily they could not be caught.
The hunt commenced in South Carolina on
Wednesday last; and up to this time we have
heard of but a single'coon saving himself?one
whig has been elected to the legislature in the
Richland district which set^ls four members to
that body.
New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Ohio, all com.
menced the hunt on Tuesday last. In New
Jersey .the democrats skinned about 3,000. The
number skinned in Pennsylvania is innumerable.
From the returns now coming in from Ohio,
we judge that the democrats have skinned about
3,000 there. It would seern, from the devices,
or emblems, on the slips containing the returns,
that the coons in Ohio, are like the old woman's
eels?"they like skinning." The device on tl e
slip of the Cincinnatti Enquirer, is one coon skinned,
and his skin nailed up against a house; a
hunter skinning another; beginning at the tail;
and a third coon is at his feet, rubbing his tail
against the skinner's legs, like a cat wanting to
be petted.?From the appearance of the insi
mentioned coon, we infer that thes have now become
so used to skinning that they like it
Hoarding Specie.?Speculators in fact, as
well as in theory and expectancy, have always
? entertained a very decided horror of the prac
tice ot hoarding specie, in trie canons or tneir
church, there is no article that will justify such
a conservative practice on the part of individuals.
Banks, that have induced individuals to put specie
into their keeping as the basis of a paper
currency, may hoard it; and in fiict it would be
well for the people in paper money times, il
those same banks hoarded it well and kept it
safely, so they might be able to restore it to its
right owners when wanted. This, however,
would not so well 6uit the modern race of speculators,
who look to the means of other people as
. the basis of all their business operations. He
who, having earned his money, feels disposed
to keep it and earn more, and who, feeling unwilling
to risk it in other hands, is set down as
a man of narrow conceptions, smal 1 of soul and
not large of mind, a poor plodding old-fashioned
character, and an enemy to "modern enterprise."
Those who condemn him thus do not stop to inquire
into his case, and ascertain the reasons fot
his close conduct, his hoarding of specie; hut ii
.they would look into the history of rnodprn bar.!;.
\ ing, and the "business operations" of themselves
and'others of their kind, they would find an casv
explanation. The hoarder of specie would 01
examination be found in the person of him win
honestly earned his money, and was unwilling
to trust it 1:1 the hands of speculators who r.?\ei
- ^ ^H--TCTrlMi?in ! ii iBaa?r?caa?*?i?
earned any themselves. lie would rather keep j I
t what he had obtained ag the reward of his indus-1'
- try, and work for more, oven though it. should,}
- bring him nothing in the way of interest, than
, risk it in the hands of "risky" men who, doing s
S "any amount" of business on the capital of oth-; i
j or people, would feel far less concern about the ;
li issue of their speculations, than if the capital i
- were really their own. Vet this very class of i <
s men, reckless as they know themselves to be t
r generally, have always, at least when the specu,
lation fever has run high, been loud in their it
j abuse of those who have hoarded specie and de- |
. nied them the use of it for their own purposes, t
.; Such people would doubtless agree fully with i
j the conclusion of the following paragrah, which j
_ we find floating about in the newspapers: 11
i. "A deposit was lately made in the U. States I
, mint of $2,513 47, in old U. States gold coins,j
i"' all dated 41) or more vears back. The impros-!
3 sion on the varoas coins was as distinct as wlnn |
r first issued from the mint?showing that they
3 had been kept out of circulation all that time.?
3 j At simple interest, this sum in 40 years would
s have amounted to <38,546. At compound Interi
est, to .325,358! And yet, notwithstanding the
.' folly of hoarding specie, as thus shown, there is
, no doubt hut that an immense sum in this coun.
try is locked up in this way?of no use to the
!' owner or the community."
i "They had been kept out of circulation all
that time"?and why! Because in "all that
. time," or at least a very great portion of it, and
, particularly the latter, the owner of those satne
cuius saw that prudence required the sacrifice of
( a probable interest, for the security of a certain
. : principal. He, and all others like him, knew
.; that "a bird in the hand is worth two in the
i bush;" hence the hoarding of specie, which has
i been such a sharp thorn in the side of those
friendly to speculation and an expansion of the
, currency, to an unnatural inflation of business,
.! of prices, of hopes, of vanity and of extravagance
j both social and commercial; and hence also it
i j has been a plague to that class of politicians,
.! whose reliance for the gratification of their ani.
i bit ion has been upon these false principles ?>i ti,'
nance, of currency, and of political economy,
. which would make three or four paper reprcscn;
tatives of one silver constituent, and force our
. abundant national resources into a hot-house,
and of course an unheal !iy growth But be it a
i plague or a thorn, or whatever else it may he
likened to, people will use it. The speculator
, may call it a "folly," but the prudent will consider
it the part of wisdom, so long as they find
safety in it and danger in its opposite; and as certainly
as that whoever placed those "gold coins"
in the mint, knows that he is not worth more

ii ten or twenty years since, so certainly will those t,
who have "gold coins" now, or silver, keep n
them, notwithstanding the hoarding of sperie t
may be denominated "folly," until the currency g
! and business of the country are?the one est ah- g
J lished and the other conducted, upon sale and p
1 honest principles. If hoarded specie be "of no (
) use to *he community," alias the speculating |,
l ciasses, it will be one day or other of use to the c
I owner of it; and this is more than thousands of b
| "widows and orphans" can say now of their spe!
cie, which was erewhile invested in bank and p
other stocks. Those who hoarded it have at least. u
the principal; many of those who have lent it out. ?
1 "at simple interest," have neither that nor the b
| principal; 60, to bring out the hoarded specie we

A SHARP CtmNTKTRJATt in/t-w-Mwi/. }!
A stout middle aged man, whose appearance ti
showed that he was fresh from the country, came s
\ into a store in Catharine street yesterday, in evi- 6
I dent excitement to inquire the route to the Poi
lice Office.?His apparent agitation induced the a
I owner of the store, "who, like Paul Pry, was na- c
jturally curious to know" to enquire as to the o
difficulty he was laboring under He stated c
that strolling through South street, lie felt some-. n
thing grazing his leg, and on looking for the cause p
saw a man picking up a pocket book, which ap- j v
pcared to be well filled, and make ofF with it in i h
great haste. At the same moment another man j t
i addressed the countryman respecting the trans- p
action, and advised that they both should start in p
pursuit. The countryman thinking he had as ?;
mucli right to the pocket-bood aforesaid, as the j|
man who found it, was eager to obtain its posses- tl
J sion. They fortunately found the man 011 a dock f
behind a wood-pile, with the pocket-book in his r
I hand, gloating over its rich contents ofX's. and p
V's. The man who joined our friend from the p
| country told the finder of the pocket-book that c
' he (the countryman) was the owner of the pock- \ h
! et-book and money, and it must be given up to ! t
i j him, and this our sharp countryman also insisted ' o
| upon. The finder, however, refused to do this, / ji
, I unless he was paid for his trouble, and was bent j c
on keeping it unless he received at least five do!- n
I lars. The countryman, eager to obtain pnssesi
6ion at so 6mali an outlay, handed out in double e
! quick timp five dollars hard money from a buck- j<
j skin purse, which the finder received, delivered tl
I up i he pocket-book, and made himself scarce-?
I The gentleman who aided in finding the lellow p
i also informed the countryman that he certainly u
I was entitled to something for his trouble, and ! ]
demanded live dollars also, adding that he was J
then yielding up a fair claim to half the contents tof
the pocket-book. This, ton, was paid, and e
i the countryman hastened to his lodgings close by, 6
went to his room, locked the door, pulled ofTlus v
| coat, and drew forth the treasure in order to have , t
i the pleasure "all alone by himself" of counting ;
' it, his head already tilled with the good he intend- j j|
ed to do, and blessing the fortunate event th.it c
"carried him to 'Vorlt." There was a thick roll ' n
of tens, fives, and smaller denominations, all I (]
handsome looking bills, as if fresh from the dif- J s
ferent banks on which they were, as their face | ?
stated, payable on demand. Notwithstanding I fj
the bills were so handsome, our countrymen! a
who knew little about bills, except the bills of; c
the Long Island Bank (he was from the Island) |,
went to a broker's office to get "mint drops" in i j,
exchange. The broker politely informed him I p
that the money, which consisted of S1U0 in City : p
Trust and Banking Co. Post Notes, Bank of Mil- | [
waukie, Hoboken Grazing Co., and other sus- c
pended institutions, was not worth a red cent, p

j opened, lie had been cheated by two knaves, and i ti
I rushed from the ollice to find the police, lie i e
; was friendly advised by the storekeeper to let 11
the police oilicc alone?that he had no more right c

THE PROTECTIVE POLICY.
It appears from a letter of Lord Stanley, the
British Colonial Secretary, to the Governor Gensral
of Canada?an extract from which we latey
published?that there is a heavy duty on the
mportation of wheat and flour into Ireland from
Canada; that is, from one portion of the British
lominions to another. All the world knows that
i large portion of the people of Ireland are
jbliged to substitute potatoes for bread, and lajor
under the greatest difficulties in procuring a
;canly supply ot the most ordinary food. Yet,
or the purpose oi "protecting" tlie interests of
>ne class in Engl aid, these difficulties are greaty
increased by a heavy duty on what is emihatically
denominated ' the staff' of lite."
Such is the operation of the protective tariff
ivery where, although it may not always be so
lalpably cruel and unjust as in this particular j
nstance. The protective tariff (for such it is to
ill intents and purposts) inflicted on the peojle
of the Unued States at the last session, is
piite as unjust and oppressive to the growers of
lotion, rice, tobacco, and ;.ll other staple eom-j
noditics of the South?with the single excepion
of sugar?as the heavj duty on Canada
lour is to the people of Irelaxl. The planters
>f the South, with the exception just noted,
van! no protection except that of equal and iin;arti:.l
justice: simply because 'here is, and
:a? be, no competition from abroad. We irn- (
>ort noi' her rice nor col ton; and hence there is
10 necessity for pro'ecting these smples, at the
'.vpcnse of other classes and sections of the
Jnion. They can, therefore, never come in
or a share in the spoils of the protective system.
Nor is this all. The proactive tariff, while it
bsolutcly depresses the price of cotton and rice,
iy chocking the importation of those manufacured
articles which arc relied on for the pay-,
nent of these great staples, enhances the price,
if almost every thing the Southern planter lias
o purchase. His clothing, and that of his:
laves; his cotton bagging; his sail; and, in ;
hort a large portion of his indispensable supilies,
are more or less burdened with itnposiionsof
thirty, si.xty, and (in some cr.ses) three
undred per cent; for which he receives no
quivaleut whatever. Thus ho is pinched thro'
oih ears, and his candle is lighted at both cuds.
On the other hand, the commerce of the
tfortliern and Middle Stiates is already withering
nder the blight oi "protection." Cargoes of
oods are scot tiack to where they came from,
ecause they cannot bear the heavy duties of the
rotective tariff; and, as a necessary consenencc,
our ships will return empty from EuDpe.
\\'c are assured, on authority which canot
he dm-iy-og. that never, even dunno the
jwesf period drttrrprossuint?wnen tnep?mrrtrrai?ars
were most loud and eloquent, was there
uch a stagnation of business as since the pas-1
fitro of itio nrnfnotive tariff hill.
With regard to the agricultural interests, they
re so intimately connected and interwined witn
ommercial prosperity, that whatever aflccts the j
ne must react directly on the other. It is to J
onmierce the fanner is indebted for a foreign I
inrket, by which the prices of all our surplus'
ruducts must necessarily be regulated; and1
/hen that resource fails, they must perish on t
lis hands. Nor has the farmer, auy more than j
lie planter or merchant, received any corrcs- j
onding benefit from the protective tariff. At the1
iresent home prices of our agricultural products,
hero is not the remotest probability of their bong
imported from abroad; and to lay a duty on,
hem would be a burlesque on legislation. The!
inner, therefore, wants (and, if he did, could j
cceivo) no pro'ection. By the operation of the
rotective taiiftj he also pays a vast additional
rice on almost every tiling he buys; and reeivus
no equivalent, either in the disposal of
is own products, or in facilities for procuring
lio.-e of others. It is t e same with the artisan
r laboring man. The protective tariff, by thus
njuriously affecting the agricultural or comrnerial
interests, not only circumscribes the demand
for his labor, but also its remuneration.
There is but one clasp of people in the Unitd
Slates, (and that, the smalhstof all) which
s benefitted by the protective tariff?namely,
lie lords of the loom and the spinning jinny.
Nothing on earth can render the protective
ystein otherwise than partial and unjust, but
is entire and perfect equality; and this is moraly
impossible. Even with the most pure and
isinlerested intentions, where is the mind that
lenrly comprehends the vast variety of combind
and conflicting interests that spread themelves
throughout this great Confederation; or
rhore the hand that can hold the balance heween
them? J?ut, even admitting the possibility
of this freedom from operation of undue
nfluence, jhe absence of local interests, longherished
prejudices, and personal views, we
aaintain tfat nothing less than omnipotent wis!om
is adequate to the great task of regulating
uch vasfcrid comprehensive distributions of
ood and ?vil. The balance cannot be held by
lUinan liaads, or controlled by human mears; I
nd as nothing hut the height, of presumption
on hi tempt man to the undertaking, so nothing
ut evil cin result from this, as it were, snatchig
the jbpire from the King of Kings, and
lacing itin the puny grasp of politicians and

HYDROPHOBIA.
Mr. J. A. Ainsile, veterinary surgeon, in a
letter to the Herald, offers the following obser
vations on this disease, and the only means we ;
are acquainted with to prevent it: "It differs j
from all other poisons by remaining in a dormant
state for weeks, or even for months, and it is
not absorbed into the system till some time after
the bite. No remedy is known for the dis-i
ease when once it is developed. None of the !
nostrums which arc said to be cures can be relied
upon. The cause of the disease is equally .
unknown. In many hot climates the disease is
equally unknown, and it has raged among us in !
the coldest weather, In 1838, I had no less j
than 48 cases under treatment; this year I have j
not had one. My predecessors, Messrs. Blaine
and Youatt, as well as myself, have been bitten
by raliid dogs, and we are still alive; and we I
have operated on some hundreds of human be-,
ings who have been bitten by rabid animals, and
in no case, has there been loss oManr. The :
preventative is as follows: The pe'rsoH ^ttj?en
should as soon as possible thoroughly wafch j
and cloanse the bitten part; not suck the poison ,
from the wound, as is too commonly done, for |
inoculation may take place by an abrasion of
the lip. If the wound be superficial and ragged,
let the edges be removed by a pair of scissors,
and then apply freely to every part the nitrate
of silver, commonly called lunar caustic, and
which may be had in any druggist shop. Il the !
wound be a punctured one,' as in some cases is
from the tusk of the animal going d<*ep into the
flesh, the stick of caustic must be carefully pnin-,
ted that it may reach the bottom; if necessary,;
the wound should be enlarged, care being taken ,
in the use of the knife, or the poison may be
carried by it over the fresh surface. The nitrate
of silver completely destroys the surlace of the

away with the destroyed surface without tlie ab j
sorbents acting upon it, and if freely applied to!
the part affected, the patient may feel periectly
sare. I do not recommend the application of a I
poultice after the operation, hut Jet the wound
be exposed to the atmosphere, and should any
intlamalion ensue, it may be relieved by the dressing
of olive oil."
Paivtinc Houses.? It lias long hern a
subject ol it quiry as to the best time to ?ip- j
plv paint to tin* chipboards of limtsts. for.
durability. Repeated experiments h.:re(
been math' wiliiin twenty-five years, which
have resulted in the conviction that paint
applieil between November and March will
stand tnore than twice as long as that
which is spread in the warmest weather. |
The reason is obvious; for, in cold weath-.
rr. the oil and the component parts of the l
paint form a hard substance on the surface !
of the clapboards, nearly as bard as glass, '
and not easily erased, or even cut with a
sharp knife, and will not soon wear off; j
whereas, paints applied in the month ufi

received a painful injury in ihe forehead, on
Thursday last, by the upsetting of Major Doneleon's
