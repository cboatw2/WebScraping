been favored by a correspondent with
he following sketch of the debate in the J
Hous.* of Representatives, on Friday and Saturday
last, on the bill **to amen i the Con?ti- i
lutio'u in relation to graining charters of in
corporation."
BILL.
Be it enacted, &c., That every charter i
of incorporation hereafter granted in this
State, shall at all times remain subject to ai*
teration, amendment, or repeal by the legislative
authority."
Mr. Rhett opened the discussion. He
hoo?d that there would be no division in the
House. The bill was intended to exercise
' wh desome restraint. It could have no |
??lfect on corporations now existing. Bii? a
salutary pow* r was reserved by it to ail sue- ,
cessive Legislature*.
Mr. Phillips was opposed to the hill. It
tiio I^inshiture a reserved power which
*"'* -- ? t? .
would be so incor!M!*t? nt with the grant of
charters of incorporation t^a* 10 individuals

Legislature hud h power ut dissolvng them at
will.
M". Bhck, of Rich! ind, followed on the
game g:d*\
Mr. II. IV. Thompson was in favor of the
bill. The itbu'O'g of corporations were so
. pre?it tr?at it was absolutely necessary to
apply a corrective to thern.
Mr. Frokt moved to am-nd the hill by confin
nif it to corpor.it iong for hanking purpogea.
an I addressed the Hou^eat Imsf'h ?n favor
of his amendment and in oppoaitio? to the
* general pi incipleg of the bill.
Mr. Henry, of Sp irtanburifh. was ?!ad
tha* the amendment had beenolT*red. It re.
lieved him of some d fficuhv. lie wnuM *u j
port the amendment and w is oppos> d to the j
ix'i.
Mr. Magrath wag opp-med to the amend* j
men! and also to the'bill, lie saw no reason )
why any difference sh u'd be made between ;
corporations lor banking porfoen and corpnr- j
atioua for other purio-e*. The evil hi
corporations of all kinds was the tendency
tiny induced to confide in th-m; and the!
fn*qiient bankruptcies which ruined those who j
Confided in them. Thig was an ev I emotion !
to all corporations and it i* the true evil to be t
corrected. The bill in its prov sions d d not ;
furnish the remedy. It punished the stock- I
holders, but it punished the creditors and |
sufferers also. Its operations would be to .

the corporation to wind up its when j
such a consequence would be ruinou? to those i
who were creditors. The object ,oc to the i
hill is that it affords no guarantee from the i
stockholders as individuals to general credi.'
tors, while a tyrannical fower is reserved !o
the State. He would go for a provision that
would make stockholders, in proportion to
their shares, responsible to creditors in case
of the bankruptcy of a corporation.
Mr. Porry, from Greeny lie, Mowed on the
same side and in oppneition to the bill.
" Mr. Davie, from Chester, was in favor of
the bill. He did not consider the objection
to the bill good. It was competent for the
Leg siatum to make such regulations as would
preserve the rights of creditors as well as
stockholder8. The question was one between
these corporations and the State. He
yvaj more inclined to trust the -8* ate. He
dented that the Legislature wou'd ever be
found disporsd to exercise tyrannical conduct
~ towarrs corporations.
Mr. Afomminger addressed the House at
length in support of the bill, tie contended
that it was right that this power should be in
fiie State. It would not be abused; He
believed the State had the right now.

He admired the independence of the Judiciar>.
and wouid do nothing that would indirectly
reflect upon that hranchof the Government.
* Mr. Tradeweil, of Richland, followed Mr.
Bellinger, and in support of the opinions he
had advocated.
Mr. .tieronr'ngfT replied, and at the close
or his argument the debate wag adjourned
to Saturday, at 11 o'clock A. M.
SATURDAY.
Mr. Carroll, of Barnwell, addressed the
House in opposition to the hill, and coneluded
hy offering an amendment, to
make stockholders liable in proportion to
the share* held at the time of failure, or
for one year ptevious?and that this feg.
illation should npplv to hank*.
Mr. H H Thompson, moved to strike
out bank-.

ment. lie did not think its proper place
was in the constitution.
Mr. Belli igt-r did not understand how
the friends of the lull, from the Commit*
tee. could opjawe the nmmdmwit. The
amendment afforded substantial relief.
The bill was vague, unlimited and ah
O F
surd. \
Mr. Memininger. moved to lay the
amendment on the table. The amend*
tuent was laid on ihetnhie.
Mr. Adams, moved to amend, by in- j
sorting, that no hanking corporation shall |
he chartered. unless with the concurrence 1
of two. third* of earh house, nod that th? !
same n?ay be dissolved with a Vote of j
i wo. thirds.
On motion the limitation to hanking
was stricken out, and the amendment was
laid on the table.
Mr. Btirt, of Abbeville, addressed the
Ifmise in support of the bill fjoui the !
committee. ,
Mr. Speers, of Laurens, was opposed
to the bill. Ho thought it violated some ,
of the fundamental provisions of the consf
tution. If substantial relief was to be
afforded, it could only be done by the
passage of such a bill as was proposed by

sioii. He deprecated the idea of the
Legislature interfering at all with the !
concerns of corporations. They had i
vested rights. He could not toinfh.

might be effected by a general act. To j

J . '
the difference in opinion in the houie, on it
the subject, was, in his opinion, a strong 5
reason against taking the vote now. He tl
denied the truth of* the position that a p
charter was a contract. It was absurd a
to say that4^e bonus paid by a bank was f
any thing more than an equivalent for ?
taxe*. ' S
Mr. Memminger insisted that the house ii
should return to-the true question. All ?
that has been said amounts to a distrust
of the Legislature. There was no foun*
dation for this* while the necessity for
legislation was strong and pressing,
Mr. Myers followed, and replied at
some length to the remarks of Mr. Hunt.
Mr. Sims of Darlington, insisted that
the friends of the hill wished to bring
hark the constitution to what it was originally.
It had, through the process of
judicial exposition, departed from first
principles.
The question was then taken on send,
ing the hill to the Senate and was lost by
a vote of 61 to 4<5.
Mr. Hunt, then moved the following
as an amendment. That no charter of
incorporation should be granted, except
j with the concurrence of two-thirds ot the <
Legislature?and that all chnrters so r
granted, shall be revoked by a vote of i
two thirds of the Legislature, unless there *
is contained in the charter an express ex- *
1 emption. t
| Mr. P errv, strongly objected to the t
amendment, and it was lost by a vote of <
53 to 53. i
AGRICULTURAL AND GEOLOGICAL SUR- a
VEY. *
From the same Paper. r
Columbia, Dec. 9. I
Your liberal views on Agriculture in- t
dure me to give you some sketch of the t
debate on that subject, which took place
on Tuesday. Mr. R >per called up the
report of the Committee on Agriculture fi
and moved the resolutions be read hii.I ^
adopted. A proposition was off-red to ( a
consider them separately, nnd the two ?i
first expressing the great advantages to <1
he derived from an Agricultural Survey r
of the State, were adopted ; hut when the ti
third was approached, which appropriated v
the means of effecting this desirable pur- (
pose, n great many political?financial? ti
social?scientific and superficial ohjec. g
lions were marshalled against it. Mr. j l<
Palmer thought we might procure a sta o
tistical account of the value of the lands ti
of the Slate from the tax hook?that a ge- a
ological survev of the state might do some n
good, but where could a man he procured u
abroad, who could teach how to plant c
cotton. Mr. Davie thought no good <|
could result, he was satisfied with the p
tax hook, and the exertions of the district a
agricultural societies. Mr. Frost would h
not vote for the appropriation till he could i
see the good result to he derived? $3,000 n
could not produce a full survey, and we p
must spend more, and he was not satis- Ij
tied as to an individual who could effect v
it. Mr. Middleton was for a geological li
survey, hut saw no advantage from an t
agricultural survey. Mr. M" minger, t
Chairman of the committee of Ways and | n
Means, the great high priest of the tern- e
pie of our mammon, approached, and put a
the sword of the State to the throat of the *
victim, pronounced a kind of funeral pan. p
egyric ou the merits of the intended sac. *
rilice, how we all lived by agriculture, and u
how he hoped one of these days to he a ii
votary himself; but declared that $3000 a
would hardly survey one district?it n
would require $30,000 to effect a survey, c
and if gentlemen were prepared to go thus t
far, they should so understand it-?-$3000 f
would not effect a useful object, and there c
were no means in the treasury. Mr. s
Perry,?who last year delivered .an address r
on agriculture, avowed he had heen caught t
voting for internal improvement*, and e
would not be caught again. Meantime ?
the friend* of the measure wore not idle, f
Mr. Roper maintained th it an agricultu* r
ral survey was necessary to develope the p
agricultural mu nitres and resources of the I
State, that this would retain our migrating c
population at home, and by the improve, v
rnent of our lands create valuable capital v
for the State to tax upon, and so increase It
her resources; that we expended too p
much for what we could proouce at home i<
in the necessaries of life, as two millions h
for stock of all kinds, and half a million i
for hav, corn, oats, &c.? that hay which c
we could so easily produce, was carried r
even to Camden, and distributed by the ii
rail road to other parts of the country, a
lie mentioned the object of an agricultu- a
ral survey and maintained its advantages n
at this time over a geological survey.-? t
The people were not prepared to take c
advar.iage of the last; while, from the t
first, immediate advantages would flow to t
every rlass of the community throughout n
the State. Gen. Adams m lintained that t
while something wa* done for every r
other class of people throughout the State, a
nothing was done for tho planter?that 'i
the tax collector could not give the in. i
formation required by au agricultural i
survey?that we wanted thn manures of ?
tli* State sought out and analyzed, and j f
hfe called on the planters to unite on the j i
measure. Mr. Carroll said the property I
of the State wax valued at one hundrud e
and ninety-two million, of dollars, of 1
which the agricultural portion amounted c
to one hundred and seventy-four million, t
Mr..Bellinger begged leave to inform the I
Chairman of the committee of Ways and r
Means, that there were $5500 in thg <!
treasury, the balance of a fund formerly r
appropriated, an 1 not now requital, indc- r
< ? - II f? i _!
p?*nnent ot turner taxation. mr. ivneu j
also said that there were $3500, which
would not be re quired, for an appropriation
for the C-dlege Library, that might
l>e employed f >r this survey?thathe whs r
no planter, but was aware of the advan- t
tages to he derived from fostering that i
pursuit?that we were foremost in passing i
abstract resolutions on government, while ;

mprivinjr their interna! resources-..that
louth Carolina would soon tag behind
he age. Mr. Henry, in a liberal and
olished speech, advocated the survey?
dverted to the advantages proceeding
rom Van NuxemY researches, and the
ine quality of iron ore, now produced in
ipurtanbargh, and spoke also of the other
ndications of mineral and other. wealth
lid in the earth, which ought to be sought
?ut and employed. Mr. Poole "moved
he indefinite postponement of the resoutiona,
for the purpose, 'he said of invi
ing discission, wiving ot 93 500 from
he College and Library might moderate
he taxes to that amount.' Mr. Roper,
in the indefinite postponement, called
or the yeas and nays, when {heproposiion
was voted down. At last, after a lit.
le more skirmishing, a final' vote was
aken on granting the a^propriation
vhon the yeas and nays were again
railed for hy Mr. Roper, and the question
lecided hy a majority of about 20, if I
ecollect right, against the appropriation.
[ ain told this was the most favorable vote
he Legislature' has ever made on the
mhject. If the planters fcrirf farmers
ould hnve agreed, they wouJ'dhavo dried
it; but we realize the fhWe"6f the
Iragons' teeth and rfpring armed from the
toil to destroy each orher. The House
vas rather in tav??rof an agTiddltu'rftl sur.
'ey, but because the friends ofa.geologi.
nl survey could not, accomplish,', their
ibject, they rejected any ?x|iep9ieiit.
The Senate was prepared to have accorded
with any resolution of the House,
irid from these petty feelings the measure
vns lost. To-day Henry's resolutions
if instruction come up, and somespright
y discussion will ensue, hut the House
vill not agree to the doctrine of instruc.

Columbia. Dkc. 11. 1841.
The House was engaged a consi lerable
>< rtion of yesterday, ifr .. discussing the
>rop isition to amend the Constitution, so
. to grant i o.v< r to the Legislature to niter
r amend a c inrter after granting it. TIih
liscussion was 'ransfcried to this day and
i'sumed accordingly; and n hard- con tea.
ed controversy it proved. The vote
ras at length taken on an amendment of
Jen. Adams, proposing that only two.
birds of the Legislature should in future
rant charters, but this resolution was
>st ; and the question recurred on the bill
f the committee, to aller the Constitu.
ion, so as to give the L -gislatoro power to
mend charters. On this the yens and
inys were taken and tne bill lost. Im.
aediatelv a motion was made to reconsidr.
and the yens and nays railed on that
uesiion and carried. Mr. Hunt then
imposed, that after the enacting clause,
n amendment which he offered should
ie adopted. It proposed, that nr. charter
n future should he granted unless by a
najority of two.thirds, the identical pro
losition of Gen. Adams,'only-in other
inguage; hut the House refused, on a
ote of yens and nays, to adopt the resolit
ion. The bill was conarquerrtly rejeeetl.
Mr. Memminger then pnoved t?
nke up the resolution offered hv.the com.
nittee, and called the yeas and, nays on

suapenaion of specie payments, nod
hat it was the duty of the Legislature to

inaniinously. The second, " proclaimn<!

tite distribl'tiox act.
Columbia, Dkc. 13,1841,.
Mr. Perry made an able Argument thii
norning against the resolutions proposing
o receive the distribution fund. "H<
naintnined that the act was extremeh
inpolitic and unwise, but that it was ai
ict parsed, and the question was, hov
night South Carolina to act ? That "tin
States had bought tlie domain of Flor-1
idn and Louisiana, and the people's raonry
had paid for it?and the other lands had
lieen ceded to the people of the United
States. That therefore the distribution
fund belonged to the people, and the Leg*
islature had no right to cone between the
people and their property, and prevent
them receiving, what of right belonged
to them. That the portion allotted to
South Carolina was not her fall share,
that the people were robbed, but that what
was offered was their own and they ought
not to decline receiving it. He aaid,
however, we ought not to act, now, but
endeavor to get the act repealed. He
said the reception of the surplus fund was
a principle identical with this, and there
was no hesitancy in receiving the amount
there proffered ut. He aaid we should
wait for a new representation* and as it
was not absolutely necessary to act now,
uait till the money was tendered. He
then said in proper time he should offer
some resolutions, dfr. Frost, thought we
ought not to take too high ground, it was
sufficient not to appoint an agent to re*
ceive?we would not then be committed
?and he moved to strike out the word*.
th? State of " South Carolina wdl not"
?hut retain the nronosition that the
- ... - - r r
Governor be enjoined to appoint no agent
to receive the money. Mr.. Henry aup.
ported Mr. Frost, he was not disposed to
' commit the State ; hut he thought the
monny might remain on deposit till we
could .<tee what ought to be the policy of
the State. He would give no pledge that
the State would never receive the money.
Mr. Hunt was glad that gentlemen had
brought the subject to its true issue?they
were afraid to decli ne the money?we
ought not to play the coquette, hut say
at owe whether they will receive the
money or not, for the act is unconstitu.
tional. and the money ought to lie approj
printed for a naw. The surplus fund
1 was a deposit, and ready to bo paid when
public necessity required; and the case
1 entirely different from that now proposed
Mr. Rhett thought the resolution did not
go as far as was said, it simply stated
that this Legislature would not receive
the money?that this Legislature would
not bind another Legislature or future
generations of men not to receive a dollar.
He thought the distribution bill, hut a
base electioneering bribe, and a party
move to elect a particular man. It will
1 be economy not to receive n dollar?because
we pay more in taxes thun we r<*.
cvive.' tMr. Palmer thought if gentl men
thought the subject was unconstitutional
they were bound to all eternity to vote a.
gainst them, and ho was not willing to
place the S'ata in an improper position.
He was not disposed to commit the State,
Mr. Henry again said he was for postpon.

ing the action ot the ataie. ne wm nm
for cutting summersets. It was a dangcrous
feat for grey headed men. nnd he
was not disposed to pledge the State at

contingencies we ought not tn anticipate,

mid accumulated n fund, and the que*
lion came up to divide this surplus, how
ought we to act ? Swell the proceeds
to those Stales who were disposed to op.
1 press ti>?he apprehended not. Mr.
Bellinger thought there was no necessity
to decide the question of receiving
| the money now?ought to use every
' I means to produce the repeal of this actnot
to declare now whnt we ought
1 to do?he would not go further than de.
clare at present we ought not to appoint
1 a receiver, and be careful of what Iangitoge
we use now?wait until we find
' the act cannot be repealed, and then say
what he shall do. If we cant do this, we
f will thon receive it; as to refuse it will be
' playing into the bands of other States,
and whilst assisting them we will be rob.
1 bed. Public lands are common property,
' and if so, we cannot any how the proceed*
of the State whall be appropriated?refuse
1 to receive what i* tendered as her share.
1 If we refuse the 80 000, the deficiency in
the treasury will still have to he supplied
1 .without helping us at all, and the money
' left idle. Mr. B. then proposed resolu.
1 tions simply saying that the State would
not appoint a receiver of the money, but
' containing the spirit of the other resolu*
tions they were received as substitutes.
Mr. Perry moved to auhatitute others
offered by h.m, in place?th*v were re.
