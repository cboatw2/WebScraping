MR. MITCHELL'S FORGERIES.
Wall silent was alive this morning will
runors of forgeries said l<> have beer
committed to a large amount by a la It
member of Congress. It turns out thai
the forgeries were made on drafts purport
lng to be drawn hv the Hank of Orleans
at Albion, on the City Hank at Albany, am
that the person by wlioin they were nejjo
tinted was Cfrn*. F. Mitchell. He went into.
Wall street oh Tuesday, and was introdueed
to several brokers, whom he
perBtiaderJ. to discount the drafts* which
t/" * otfnninti
were endorsed Oy rurnscti. e
the drafts.Jtfe re]" returned from Albany, af
for<rerle^l:iftid Mtv Mitchell not being
found at"?his 'longings, it was. presumed
that hethaff absconded, . About tbe sarr.c
lime, letters were rccei.ved from Philadelphia,
' containing "fcuversi forged drafts,
made by .the .same bank of Orleans on the
Merclf:Yni*3 batik of~tfrb~city., antl endorsed
by Mitchell. The drafts in both cases,
were for 'various amounts, from three
])tindred>lo two thousand dollars.
This Mitchell was a member of the lasl
Congressf-firorn-'l'fre-'Niagara District, hi
his State, antl- for the last eight years
has been a resident of Lockport. He was
cxtensirefv fcngfiged in the flour-mill buisi"
ness, when be was elected to Congress in
1836, and're-elected in 1839. During the
last session he was one of the candidates
presented to General Harrison for the appointment
of Navy Agent to this port.?
Failing to succeed in this, he became an
applicant for a place in the custom house.
Mr. Mitchell has been strongly supported
in his applications by the Whig party.
We are told that Mitchell relinquished
his claims to the office of Navy Agent on
the ground that he should be appointed to
the auditorship in the custom house.
The following letter has been uddressed
by the "honorable genilpman" to the Editor
of the Courier:
"Sir: As the circumstances connected
with my name, together with the public
station I have held, will give rise to a
good deal of comment, I deern it not improper
to make a brief statement of facts
r?leaving each one to form such opinion
respecting them as he shall choose.
"It always has been the case, so it will
be a train, that as soon as public reproach
attaches to the name of an individual who
had been deemed respectable before, instances
are sought and fabulously pointed
out in bis previous history, to show thai
' ho has always been an unworthy member
of society; I cannot hope to be un exception
to this pervading rule; and I dare
to say, that there will be found plenty^of
persons ready to swear that I had always
been a very considerable,rascal. Now, I
own, that up to this day, never in the
whole course of my life, have 1 done an
act with the intentiou of injuring any human
being, or wronging any man out of
one cent. I have committed some very
great errors?partly my own, partly
through others,?but never, never before
to-day, a crime. How nuini persons
have been benefited by my good offices-it
is not for mc to say. But I might appeal
to the whole population of the county of
my late residence to bear testimony to my
fair and honorable dealing, to my liberality,
and to my uniformjtioitft'ess to all who
I was brought ioto contact with. I went
to Lockport twelve years ago; when I
arrived there, I did not know a human
soul in the county; I was just out of my
minority; I carved out my own path; was
successful in business, made money rapidly;
had regiments of friends?that is,
when I was making money very fast; rose
to distinction among my fellow men, and
in about eight years after my arrival in
the district. I was elected a representative
lo Congress, and under circumstances peculiarly
gratifying.In my persona! vanity;
for whilst I received a majority of over
pne hundred, not another person on the
samt? ticket received ..any majority at allincluding
fcfth counties. 1 am willing lo
admit that there is a shocking sight of
humbug in this world, and especially at
this day and date?But whether the people
of 33d CongressipauJ. district were humbuged
in electing me lo:Cohgress when I
was not worthy, is for them lo decide: 1
have been accused by my enemies of being
a great intrigiier-^of being a great
schemer in politics, and I suppose now
that I have sehemedin other matters they
will take npbn themselves no doubt great
credit for their sagacity, in thus early characterizing
mc.- :
U1 might tell a tale that Would be very
interesting to a great many people, but i
have'nt time no\v to-do it?'I Bm to
that region where l/?xpect to find many
just as good as mysfclfi and quite as good
as them I leave behinrd>me.
"t write this calmly, eaHy in the morning,
after a sleepless night; What my
feelings are n,a onq can imagine. I have
before me a path environed with imminent
peril. I shall be a wanderer all the
days of my life in an unknown land, leaving
behind me fiiends and kindred that
are nearer and ilearfir to me than my own
heart's blood, who .must nil share in the
disgrace which attaches to me. I leave
behind me my wife and -children! May
God throw his protecting arm around
them, is alt that I can sa)v Arti 1 not pUn*
ished sufficiently severe for all that I have
done? Why, death to me were ubsolute
relief, but i cannot embrace it. I have
. canvassed the whole ground over careful
Jy. There were three alternatives presented
te me:
"To remain and meet my fate in the
eyes of all who know me, to commit sui

if I were overtaken 1 have provided myI
self with two contingent friends, either
of which will spare me the mortification

ble to t/iat."
I Singular Case.?A French paper call
( "" a
> ed the Audience, contains a letter from n
i private correspondent, dated Gibralter,
1 the 28th Feb. wliich states that an opulent
f OrliisH m'erchatit, 'flamed ' JanterBolcvvell,
: long resident there, had been tried and
I convicted of the murder of his daughter,
' on circumstancial evidence, and that on
the way to execution the convict saw in
> the crowd an >ther Englishman,. named
: Johh Keats,?who-had been extremely-ac
live in collecting evidence against hirn. ?
, The convict expressed a desire to die in
' peace with all mankind, and to pardon this
person, whom he had considered his greatt
est enemy. When the convict reached
HThe scaffold, the executioner was prepar&
ing to excute' "the sentence of the law,
i when a voice was heard in the crowd ex
claiming?"It is I that am guilty, and not
i the convict." This exclamation was made
:: by John Keats. He confessed that it was
" * ~ w ^ - |%
1 he who carried off James tjoxwen suaiigtiler;
lhal he had cut off her hair during
her sleep, ami stolen one of her dresses,
which he steeped in 'blood; and that the
generous pardon granted to him by his
victim had caused him to reflect on the
enormity of his crime. Tho ixeculioner
immediately withdrew the rope from the
convict's neck, and the cap from his face,
when it was discovered that he was dead
from the .'ffects of terror. The atrocious
John Keats was conducted to prison
amidst the execrations of the populace,
who wished to tear him to pieces.
That's a Fact?Speaking of the pickpockels
hanging about the United States
Banks, the New York Herald shrewdly
adds: "but after all, the depredations
caused by the pickpockets' outside the
banks, cannot begin to compare with the
depredations that have for months been
committed by the pickpockets within the
bank, $50,000 would probably cover the
amount stolen by the former, whereas the
latter have within the last three years,
picked the pockets of tin* community of
from $20,000,000 to $50,000,000, and jt
is useless to offer a reward for its recovery."

I The Kentucky Slave Law.?We learn
from the Lexington, (Ky.) Observer, that
on ihe 31st uli. Judge Woolley pronounced
the law of 1833, which prohibits the
introduction of staves into the CommonI
wealth, unconstitutional. Since this decision,
it is stated, several prosecutions,
which had recently been instituted, have
b. en abandoned, ft is suggested that judge
Woolley, who is said to hive displayed
"great ability and prof'tind constitutional
research" on the occasion, write out ard
publish his opinion; and this it is to be
hoped he may do, that the Court of Appeal
niHy have before them, in a shape
which cannot be misunderstood, the
grounds of a decision which will create
very general surprise bulh in and out of
Kentucky.
Tough Meat story.-^-The editor of
Kr? Rirm flaTPitf? sacs, he has an uncle
whose grandfather knew a neighbor who
had a cow that broke her leg, so that amputation
became necessary. The operalion
look place and the operator succeeded
in replacing the leg with one of wood.
After the operation the cow recovered her
health, gave birth to a ralf and yielded
her milk ue usual. The mi!k, however,
tasted fur some lime of the wood, but this '
flavor at length ceased. When killed, the i
wooden leg made as good stakes as any i
other, though hardly as juicy*

Machinery of the Human FhamE.?
Very few, even to mechanics, are aware
how much machinery there is in their
bodies. Not only are there joints and
hinges in the bones, but there are valves
in the veins, a forcing pump in the heart,
and various other a curiosities. One of
the muscles of the eye, forms a real pulley.
The bones which support the body
are made precisely in that form, which
has been calculated by malhemalicans, to
be strongest for pillars and supporting
columns; that of cylinders. This form
combines the greatest.Jightness with the
greatest strength. "'Of this form are the
quills of birds' wings, where these requisites
are necessary.
Gen. Jackson in Pecuniary Distress.?
The following paragraph, from a late
number of the Louisville Journal, will be
feat! with pain:?"A ,few weeks ago we
saw a very long letter from Gen. Jackson,
to a gentleman who had drawn on him for
one hundred dollurs; He acknowledged
that the money was due; but stated that he
was so miserably embarrassed by his seem
ruy UCU15 U5> vu UC uucnv uunuiu VII laioc
the small sum necessary to meet the draft.
He said he had some blooded stuck which
he was. willing to give up to the drawer of
1 the draft, but that $100 in money was out
1 of the question."

on what they owe, from those whom they
owe, and for a thing within itself of no
Intrinsic value.'

We learn that the system of removals
from office is soon id go fapidljr on, undei
the principles declared in President Ty>
ler's Inaugural, a complete change in the
revenue officers of the port of Philadcl
phia, has taken place. Four or five of.the

post office have received notice to quit,

soon.
The extra session of Congress will
soon bring political questions to an issue,
There is increasing and manifest indiffer
ence as to the result, even among those
'who were heietofore clamorous for a
National Bank, and a distribution of the
proceeds of the sale of the public lands
So tar as the President is concerned, il
may be considered as certain, that he will
not oppose any banking machine for giving
effect to the bowers of the government,
that may be agreed on by Congress.
But, in the absence of any recommendation
of a specific scheme, except what ma)
come from the Secretary of the Treasury
and in the absence of any executive influence,
in its support, it is not very pro
k-.,kl? tbat Congress will be able to agret
upon the details of any banking system.
First, we arc met tyith the practica
difficulties of obtaining such confidence
and credit for n National Bank, as would
ensure subscriptions from private capitalists,
at home or abroad, to its stock
Without the aid of government credit, in
some form, the capital could not be obtained.
The form of a funded debt would
be the most convenient. But, if I understand
the Inaugural correctly, a resort tc
a debt in the lime of peace, is specially de
precated by the President; and he recommends
the adoption of such a system ol
revenue and expenditure as will enable us
to avoid the necessity of a debt. Bui
there are many other difficulties to be mcl
in settling the details of a bank. The
mode of securing an honest administration
of a bank is not the least of these difficulties.
Some propose to take it out ol
the control of speculators and business
men?whether of Wall street or Chestnut
street--and appoint Directors through the
agency of Congress, who shall be responsible
to Congress. But, are we sure that
men w.lio deal in politics are less easily
tempted than those who deal in cotton, in
' -J ! 1
slocks, coal, lanus. ana groceries*
Suppose a bank of deposite and issue,
without the power of borrowing money,
be proposed. It would answer the purposes
of a fiscal agent of the Government;?but
it is ohjpcted to this plan that
it would do no good?make money no
pleutier?and be of no profit to stockholders.
The Senate will stand 27 to 25 on the
abstract question of a National Bank.?
Should any one of the 27 prove impracticable
in regard to details, the measure
will be lost;?for their is no longer any
Vice President to give- a casting vole.
The President,/?ro tempore will vote as a
Senator. I see little or no chance, therefore,
of the passage of a bank charter at
the special session. The Sub-Treasury
will, however, be repealed, and we shall
fall back upon a despotic system,?making
use of specie paying banks, as fiscal agents,
wherever- they ran be found. The
revenue will then be paid, under a law
enacted For the purpose, either in Treasury
notes, in specie, or in the notes of
banks payable and paid in specie. This
will pnrouratre and assist the iocal banks
to resume, and maintain resumption of,
specie payments: and will drive the broken
banks into liquidation.
Fro/n the New York Journal of Commerce.
The Position of New York-?Wc
hear from Philadelphia and other places at
the South, that the banks of New York
will speedially suspend specie payment.?
This report has been so confidently circulated,
that it has, at least in some small
degree, embarrassed exchanges in the city.
The citizens of New York suffer less from
such an error than those at a distance who
deal with us, yet the injury is general,
nnd should not be be inflicted without at
lenst some plausible ground to support it.
But we do not expect to prevent the repetition.
VVe have no doubt many men are
very sincere in believing that the New
York banks must soon suspend. Perhaps
the fact that we write this article, and so
show that we care something about the
matter, will confirm their opinion. Those
vho choose to believe us, will have the
benefit of the truth. There is nothing in
the slate of things at present which has
the least tendency to produce suspension
here. Specie is flowing in from all quarters;
the exchanges of the whole world
are in our favor, with the exception, it
may be, of CubaV the paper held by our

given for actual purchases, and will be
paid at maturity, and very little of it has
more than ninety days to rum The merchants
are so independent in their circumstances,
that the whole loans of the banks
might be paid without producing any
very great distress. Specie is as plenty
as pa pert What then is the cause ol
suspension? We shall not break because
Philadelphia breaks, or Baltimore, or any
other city. Their course imposes no ne<
cessity upon us, but rather brings u.?
strengths The uncertainly about South
ern currency is making New York, more
rapidly than before, the settling house o
the whole Atlantic coast. Indeed, wt
understand that it is no uncommon thinj
for transactions in Philadelphia to be made
payable in New York, though neither ol
| the parlies rcjsiile hera? and some the
leading houses in Philadelphia and further
i South, have found it convenient to open
accounts with Wall street banks, artjj
keep their surplus funds hero Bills ol
t exchange drawn in foreign ports on any
place upon our Atlantic coast, are now
! very extensively made payable in New
i York. So, taking it all in all, those whc
, look for the dishonor of New York, ivil
find the result they anticipate, receding
further and further from their grasp.
GEN JACKSON AND THE BIDDLI
[ BANK.
The time has come when Europe anc
America will do justice to General Jack
! son, in relation to the Bank of the Unitei
i States?when his sagacity, his courage
i his incorruptibility, in relation to that in
. stitulion, and his saving the public monej
t in it?will be the ihemc ot universal ap
I plause, and of unbounded national grati
lude. He, eight .years ago, took tlx
, ground that.the institution was CORRUPT
, and INSOLVENT; and, acting upon tha
. belief, he interposed his great measures?
r the vetc?the removal of the deposites,
the specie circular?the law against thi
. circulation of the old note's?the sale o
- the United States stock in the institution
These measures huve saved the Unitei
States stock, and got for it $118 on th>
I share, which is now selling for 815 a share
: they saved the deposiles, amounting ti
I many millio.ns; they stopped the receipt o
the notes at the land offices and customs
. and saved millions more: they stopped th<
i issue of the old dead notes, and suvet
millions again: above all, they slopped tin
I existence of the Bunk, and thereby pu
an end to the dominion of the most COR
? RUPT and CORRUPTING instituiioi
which the world ever beheld?a fountair
of corrupiton which spared nothing pub
f lie nor private, and poured its bribes inte
( the hands of every functionary that woule
I lake them. If it had not been for Jack
. son, that vast colossus of crime and foun
t lain of corruption would now be in ful
i life, sustaining itself on the credit and re
sources of the United States?taxing tin
people to fill its vaults?and emptying it;
i vaults to enrich its favorites and to subsi
[ dize members of Congress, and to pen
s sion as many as were necessary tosustaii
it. For these acts, which saved the coun
; try, the Bank had the patriot Piesiden
condemned by a Senate, many of wbon
i were its debtors, attorneys, and retainers
the people expunged that infamous sen
tence; and now it is to be revived by ex
punging the expunging resolution. More
the very men who devoured that .Bank,
are demanding a new one! The same
men, and the same party, after eviscera

another of fifty or one hundred millions
and these men, by a freak of fortune, are
