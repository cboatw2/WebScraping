Owing to the death of Mr. H. Brinker- 1
bob, of Ohio, no legislative business was f
transacted in either branch 6t Congress
to-day.
In the House, the fact was.anounced by t
Mr. Potter, after which the customary res- <

respect tothe memory of the deceased, a
motion to'adjourn was made and carried. 1
In the . Senate, the same melancholy f
duty was performed by Mr. Allen, after
which that body also adjourned.
The consideration of the tariff bill will

May 10.
In the Senate, there were,-as usual, an
ti-Texas petitions, .and. petitions against
any modifeation of-the tariff.
The Chair presented the petition of a
man who, hy mistake, has located himself
and slavesewithin the boundary of'Texas.
He asks the passage of a bill torhelp him.
Mr. Sevie' observed. that there are
many cases of this character. He hoped,
however, that all 4iffculty would be re
moved.before 'the- close-of the sedsion, by
annexation of Texas.

May 13.
In the Senate this morning, there were,
is usual, numerous memorials, both in
avor and against the annexation of Texas.
Mr. McDuffie presented resolutions in
avor of the annexation, adopted at a meet
ng held in Marion District.
Tbe House bill providing for the relief
bt' the survivors, of those lust in the shcr.
Grampus, was next taken up and ordered
to be engrossed.
A message was received from the Pre
sident, transmitting two Treaties: one
with the King of Wurtemburg, and the
ther with the Graud-Duchy of Hesse.
The remainder of the day was spent in
Executive session.
In the House, on motion of Mr. Cave
Johnson, the joint resolution from the Sen
ate providing fer a termination' of the
present session on the 28th instant, was
taken up.
Mr. Johnson then took the floor for the
purpose of making some remarks prepar
story to a motion for the previous ques
tion.
Mr. Parmenter hoped the gentleman
would pause before moving the previous
guestion, because the resolution provided
or an adjournment on the "27th of May
iext." Hence, if adopted, Congress would
nave to set a year longer. This suggestion
aused the most outrageous laughter.
After further proceedings, Mr. Houston
oved to amend the resolution by stri.
ring out "May 27th," and inserting "June
L7th.1
Mr. C. y. Ingersoll moved to 1ay the
whole matter as the table; but without
uccess.
The question was then put on the mo
ion of Mr. Houston to insert "June 17;"

cores of private bills, the House bill pro.
riding for the relief of the survivors of those

The bill to abolish the office of Solicitor

ion up. A long debate arose ;relative to

ill was ordered to be engrossed.
The adjournment resolution, as amen=

Mr. Evans thought the business might

Tbe amendment was opposed on the
;rond that, if the .resolution was again

For the AdMrtiser.
Editor of the Hamburg Journal :
Sin,-In our last piece we .reviewed your
exposition of Mr. Clay's principles, which we
regret did not appear with our review of it.
There were some things in the number of the
Journal containing it, and much in your last,
which deserve notice. When we begun this
correspondence, we supposed that it would end
with the interrogatories and your answer. It
required, however, nearly a months reflection,
and a second article, to produce your answer.
r Even then you did not answer fully and can
didly. Your answer to our first interrogatory
would have been candid and -intelligible had
you replied, simply, that Mr. Clay was in fa
vor of a Tariff, "discriminating" in favor of
P what he is pleased to carl, "American Indus
.try." To our question, " should a candidate
be held responsible for the conduct of his par
ty," you made no answer at all. We will vary
its form, and now ask: If it is fair to infer that
the principles which uniformly governs a party
will govern its candidate if elected? We trust
that you will now answer this fully.
We supposed, in the beginning of this cor
respondence, that you either believed Mr.
I Clay's principles to be different from what you
have avowed them to be, or that you took him
only in preference to Mr. Van -Buren-as a
choice of evils. But in this we fear we have
been mistaken. From the warm and earnest
manner in which you supported Mr. Calhoun,
we supposed thag his principles were your's
but from the last number of the Journal, we
should infer that you differed from him on all
questions of national politics, toto cole. As a
proof of this, we will merely mention, that but
I a short time ago, you published, without com
a ment, a long article, from some Georgia Whig
paper, denouncing the doctrine of Free Trade.
Then' you announced the fact, that Mr. Van
Buren had deserted the South, on the Texas
question, with evident satisfaction. Better, to
your opinion, that the South should pePish than
that Mr. Clay should be injured. But in tha1
you were mistaken. The "Loco foco's," as
I you phrase them, have the honesty todenounce
t and renounce Mr. Van Buren, as soon as he
l shewed himself capable of yielding to the aboli
tion fanaticism of New England and Greal
Britain. Judging them by the Whigs, you sup
posed they would. give up Texas, rather than
Van Buren. If they sustained Van Buren they
t could not denounce Clay, therefore you rejoic
ed that our last hope of gaining Texas was lost,
I if thereby Mr. Clay could be saved. '
Again.-Your paper is full ofdenunciations
of the " Loco-Foco's"-wio are they ? Do you
f allude to Calhot, lcDufie, Huger, Bart
and others of darae'egation in Congress?
You approvi7cordially of Clay's " masterly
a letter," and regret that you cannot publish it
Not one word do you say of Mr. Calhoun'
truly statesmanliknd unanswerable letter
not one word of tigret that you have no roont
for it. Bat, you can find room for a long ox
tiact from Lord Aberdeen's letters, with then
comments of the Chronicle and Sentinel, "tc
show the desperate game played by the politi.
cal, stock, and land gamblers, and those in then
confdence of the administration, &c., to impost
upon the people." Charging those in the coo,
fidence of the administration with the attempi
to "poison the public mind,"of using "desper
ate means" to effect this object, and of "pub
lishing grous:misrepresenitations," as to the in.
tentionstof England. For whom is all thim
meant, if not for Mr. Calhoun ? Who else hat
made the charge upon-the Br itish gov'ernment1
Again-in lifo Journal of May 15, you can find
room for along extract from Mr. Clay's letter;
but every reply to it is carefully excluded. A
cause must edesperate indeed, which has tc
be supported bysuch meanness.
In the last nuniber of the Journal, you ray
that-you "have confidence in the ability, pa
triotism, and forpsils of Mr. Calhoun," and
that you belijef what he does will he for the
good of his counitry." In the next sentence
you contiinue.as-to any fear from the power
of Eglagnhlltinater;that is aU humbng.
Mr. Calhoniithfii~a differently-he is at Wash
ington-has all the facta before him-and doubt
less many NIat have not been published-and
he says, most emphatically, that England doei
intend interfeging., You pronounce this "hum
bug."-Thi is ,certainly complimentary Ian
Iguage to useef yourjfrat choice for the Press
decy,-a maa-iai whose "ability, patriotism, and
foresight" you have "confldence," and who
will, you believe, doinothing but "for the good
of his country." Upon what do you predict
this opinion? 'Ih whole of Mr. Calhoun's
letter is directed to the defence of slavery, and
t the establishmnt of this one point-that it is
te ddiberate purpose of England to obtain foot.
ig in Texasifor the, purpose of assailing the
South. Yet,without even the semblance of ar
gument-without adducing a single fact, you
denoune it as a miserable "humbhug." All
things being eq-ial, we are not disposed to dis
pute the fact, that more confidence should he
placed in your judgment. particularly on a
question of state policy9 than in that of John C.
Caloun. But, we submit, with delerence,
that some weight should be allowed to the con
sideation that, he is on the ground, and may
neware of'facts which do not comne within
dyor knosrledge,
If otheriproof wereowanting of yeur having
repudiated all your Carolina principles, and
four frat choice, with them, it could be dntirely
ettblished, by your announcnentof the Whig
Jietory in :Virginia. You rejoice at it, -and
qtidte with approbation the statement of the
<Richmond Whig" that the party have ye.
ted to"msustain the Bak, the Tariff. Distri
bution, and Heunry Cla i." If- these are - youri
Ipringules, will you be 'ind enough: to inforts
tag .fond of watching otbert,.had now
nuns time for _a little relaxatiob. - He
bought the gentleman needed it. (Great
anghter.)1 ="
Finally, all further proesedings in the
:all were suspended.
The House then rejected the proposed
mendment of Mr. Hamlin to the election
sill.
The bill was then passed by a vote of
l41 to 34, an'd sent to the Senate.

WEDNESDAY, MAT 22, 1844.
"We will cling to the Pillars of the Temple o
ourLiberttes,and tfit mustfall,etetwill Peris
amidst the Ruins."
RE-ANNEXATION MEETING.
The citizens of the-District o
Edgefield, are requested to mee
in the Court House, on Sale Day
in June next, for the purpose o
expressing their views, as to the
re-annexation of Texas to the
United States.
iE7 It affords us pleasure to insert the aboyt
call for a meeting. We doubt not that it wil
be responded to from every section of the Dis
trict. Let the people assemble and cousidei
their grievances, and consult together. There
are, we believe, but few Whigs in the District
but we invite those few to join us. If theil
candidate is opposed to re-annexationso is th
man who was ours. This is no time to thin]
of men, our country is in daiger. She mus
be rescued notw, "or be forever fallen." Thn
Texas question, however important, is not the
only one that demands our. attention. It wil
be recollected, that in 1832, South Carolini
declared, that after a certain ,day, no duties
should be collected, within her limits, nude
the Tariff of 1828. Before the arrival of th
day specified, Mr. Clay (who, but a few mouth
before, bad congratulated the Senate, that pro
tection of Northern manufactares, was the set
tied policy of the government,)introduced, int
the Senate, a bill modifying materially the bil
of1828, and providing that, in 1842, protectio:
should cease, and that duties should thin be laic
with a view to revenue only. South Caroline
suspended her ordinance till the bill shQuld b
passed. or be rejected. It was passed. Tb
principle of protection was yielded, and Mi
Clay, its great champion, was made to. say tha
it was no longer to be " th setted policy of tk
government." We waited ten long years, ani
on the day we were to be blessed with "Frei
Trade," a Protective TanriW la eprohibitarj
and odious, in all its ftnires tlien the bill o
1828, was passed. It was passed in*June byi
lawless Wig majority. The elections were tt
come on- in October. We believed iat' ti
next Congress would be Democratic. Tha
party had pledged themselves to repeal th
Tarifi'. if elected, and we belIeved they wouki
redeem their pledges. They too have failed us
We regret to see. that in the Charleston reso
lutions this question is not alluded ton Impor
ant as the Texas question is to us, it -is no
more impor tant than the. Tariff question. I
rexas be not re-annexed we must roose oni
slave property; but if the Tarif be not repeal
sd, ve care not whether we: be permitted ti
keep it or not,for it oiUl bcrendered useless ta
us. We are noro but the Overseers of our Nor
imrn Masters. We are permitted to keep oui
egroes and work ;ocm; but they -raKE -rm
P~OFITs. If this state of things is to Continue
;hey may take our negroes also. We do no
esire to get up an excitement on this question
We wish simply to bring it to the view of the'
people, that they may consider it calmly, anc
when they have done so, determine deliberate
y, hat their duty to themselves and to theil
State require them to do.
By our exchanges. we find thai meetings have
ther taken place, or are about to take place
n every District in our State, and ina majority
>fthe States in the Union.
1 is expected that the Hon. F. W. Pickens,
d some two or three other prominent gentle
nen, will address the-meeting.
OJ' The weather for the last week has beet
very warm, without any rain; we have' had
seasional signs, but have always been disap.
ointed by the wind-the crops and gardeni
n this vicinity are nearly "used up," vegeta
ion in particular, look. as if it could not stand
nuch longer witbout at least a small shower,
t the moment of closing our form there was
slight sprinkle, but the wind blew too stroof
'or it to last long enough to do any service.
ET " Perseverance," hashbeon received,~
ihall appearin our next.
17 According to promise, we have this.day
ublised, on our first page, the reply of' the
sditor of''the Hamburg Journal to our corres
iondent " Carolina." We are always willing
o show "fair play," to all parties, and hope
hat the editor of this Journal, moved by the
rood feelings ofjustice to all, will not refuse to
mblish the remarks of" Carolina."
Temperance Cousentio-.-The call of the
hairman of the State Temperance Sopiety,
'or a meeting ofthe State Temperance Conven
ion, to take 'place in this villager 31st dayso

Mr. Culpeper, who is at pr'esenmt deflvering
[.oct'ures on the subject..of.T~eperace, has
mipressed a willingness to spend a few day
n this district, previous to thre meeting of the
,o-...,:- .,e would therefore advise onm
tainly not with the hope of carrying therm 6111.
The Spectator too is denounced as a'"pretend
iug devotee to the Democratic cause." Do"
you really believe that that paper is but pte-.
t/ndlag to support the Democratic party 7 W h'at
.evidence have you of it? Is it its devotion to
Mr. Calhoun, and its detestation of Mr. Clay
and his Tariff clique? But what we regret
more than all else, is the statement w-ich you
make in the last Journal, that the'bill reducing
the Tariff of 1842, was laid on the table "on
motion of a Democrat." This looks unfair-it
looks as if you were determined to conceal the
truthwhenever it is calculated to injure the
Whigs. The Democrats have acted .badly
enough on the Tariff question, God knows, and
therefore we have dropt Van Burue; but they
have not acted so badly as the Whigs. The
bill proposing a reduction of the Tariff, was
laid on the table, by a vote of 105 to 99-of the
99 who voted against laying it on the table 98
were Democrats, and 1 was a Whig. Chap
poll of Georgia, was the only Whig in the UNI
TED STATEs-North, Sora. East,.or West, who
voted for the REDUCTION of the'arif. We put
it to your candour, if any oneswould-ever have
suspected such to be the fact;from your notice
of it in the Jodrnal? And for even this one yote
the National Intelligencer has deemed it pru
dent to apologise, by saying that Mr. Chappell
would not have voted for the reduction of the Ta.
rif had he not been bound by a previous pledge.
After this the "Richmond Whig"may well say,
that the support of the Tariff is one of the prin
ciples of the Whig party-well may he say so,
when but ONE Whig can be found in all Con
gess, who is in favor of a reduction of the Ta
riff, and his vote has to be apologised for, even
at the expense of truth. Is further proof want
in; of. your having deserted your party, your
principles, your candidate, and your country
for Clay ? We quote your own words. You
call on the Whigs "to suf'er nofalse vaporings
about local afairs-no braggart notions of
Southern Chivalry--oTHuuo to divert their ,at
tention from the great end and aim of their
organization-the redemption of the country
from Locofocoism unde* every conceivable dis
guise. What matter whether it appears under
the disguise 'of Van Burenism, of Tylerism,
CkLnouNzesn, or Stewartism? Is it not the same
UNCHANGED AnOMINATION ?" Will you state
how long it has been since you were possessed
of so cordial a detestation of this "unchanged
-abomination," under the disguise of" Caihoun:
ism?"- What are the "local affairs," upon
which you fear "' Southern Chivalry" will ex
pend its "braggart notions" and "false vapor
mgs?" The unimportant question . of Slavery
we suppose.
We intended to notice briefly, Mr. Clay's
objections to the Annexation; but we have not
time. We will do so in the next Advertiser.
If you reply to this, will you be kind enough
to publish it entire? .
CAROLINA.
Since writing the above, we have obtained a
copy of Mr. Clay's Speeches, and have ex
amined the two referred to by.you. -Neither
speech is upon the "Right of Petition." But
from oneywe find that he is opposed to slavery,
and from the other, that he is in favor of the re
ception ofpetitions. Let him speak for himself.
"It is well known to the Senate, that Ihave
thought that the most judicious course with
Abolition Petitions hasnot of late been pursued
by Congress. I have believed that it would
have been wisest to have received and referred
them, without opposition, and to have:reported
against their object in a calm and dispassionate
and argumentative appeal to the good sense of
the whole community."
' I ddtire no concealment'of my opinions in
regard to the institution of Slavery. I look
upon it as a peat evil, and deeply lament that
we have derived it from the parenral govern
ment, ad from our ancestors. I wish every
slave in the United States was in the country of

Mr. EDIvo.-J was not a little gratified or
perusing your paper of the 8th inst., to find.a
suggestion for a public meeting of the citizent
of this District upon the subject of the Annex
ation of Texas, as I was fearful there would be
no move on the part ofour citizens until all the
other parts of the State had acted, as we are
generally backward in expressing our opinioi
upon great qutestions, wvhether from a lack ol
knowledge, or a disposition to remain quiet irt
affairs which cocerns, more especially, the
General Government, I am at a loss -to discov
or. The present state of affairs, I think, de'
mands the attention of all our citizens, as we
are on the eve of an election, which, must

or sInk it below what it has been for the last
four years, which in all conscience, but for the
independent course pursued by the present
executive, would have been far below medio.

for the Presidential chair, who are the avowed
enemies of the South. one of which has alrea

their own original principles; shall we stand

gather around our beloved Palmetto, talk over
our grievances-ontsult among ourselvea
pass resolutions how to act-select suitable,
sterling, tried citizens, as our candidates for
