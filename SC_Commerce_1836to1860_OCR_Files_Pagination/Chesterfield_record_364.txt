ON CUTTING WOOD FOB VARIOUS USES.
There has been muoh diversity of opi
ion relative to the time of the year mc
proper for cutting wood for timber or fu?
GoodstlCs Farmer of tho 26th ult. observ
"that where durability is the object, timb
should be-cut at that seaeou when there
least sap in it, say in February; but whe
* ? - ? _? : i i ?,
a fs Tor me purpose ui clearing kuiu ui
the timber to be cut is of a kind likely
sprout, then it is desirable to have it c
when there is sap in it, as that not on
prevents the stumps from sprouting, b
they rot much sooner than when cut
February,n
The opinion of Mr. Goodsel! is corrob
fated by a writer from the New York Fa
mer, in a communication re-published
the N. E. Farmer, vol. 10, pp. 237, 23
In this it is stated, "we do not seem sufl
ciently aware of the range of expansion ai
contraction afgreeo and growing wood, i
the extent of variation in bulk expanded at
contracted by heat and cold. When oec
pying the least space the wood is of cour
most dense and compact, and it has the
the least possible quantity of sap in it.More
than fifty years ago my father ht
occasion for a barn floor, for use in wint<
the British having been so managed th
the farmers of the aorth could return to the
farms, on doing which his was destitute <
? barn floor, in the depth of winter i
the only alternative he cut down?felled i
the paper farmers say, large red oak tree
fad them sawed into two and a half inc
planks, antf lakJ his floor, perfectly grcei
expecting to lay them ovet again when the
got soasor\pd and shrunk as lie suppose
they would do. This was all done in th
severe cold of a northern winter, and thr
floor has never yet been overhauled, nc
have the planks opened a seam. The sa
was all in hs quarters in the roots under th
blanketing of the muck, and of course coul
not be in th? tree, which was compacte
into the smallest possible space. The hoop
of winter, in these days, were driven wit
tremendous force.
From all these considerations, and fact
(I could che multitudes of similar facts,}
come to the conclusion that !he proper tim<
to cut wood for timber is when the sap i
least in quantity in such wood, and whei
this is least likely toiead to a fermentation
The more saccharine^ matter it has in it
the more likely it is to lead to this process
hs weH as generally, the more sap. Th<
sugar maple, which abounds iu this quality,
If cut immediately after the growth of wood
'.m.
1 even very durable as fence pos's, if not set j
tit! thoroughly seasoned. The same is also j
r true ?;fbemlock uud several other kinds of
I wood, tut they must he well seasoned,,
y before set in'o the ground, as all fence posts
; | should b-\ WltCn wood occupies its lea^t
s | possible space, it is time to cut it bo:h for
a i fuel and timber."
n i The late Col. Pickering, in an essay on
dj"Thc Felling of Trees for Timber," pub.
a lislied in the Now England Farmer, vol. 1
- ; onrrt) 17, gave certain facts which led him
r, i to 'believe that 'the best time J or felting
i. j timber trees for durability, was when their
j sap was vigorously flowing.." Other wri_
' lers, too numerous to be here quoted, have
c. i also recommended May and June, as the
k proper months for cutting down timber
y i trees, where durubil ty is t!:e object. We
jf will, however, quote another passage from
k j Col. Pickering's essay above referred to.
m j "Accident threw in my way the lat*
Oliver Evans* 'book on the construction of
es mills,' to which was subjoined a treatise of
a Mr. Elliot, a millwright, on the same sub,;r
ject. Turning over some of the leaves of
>h j this trea ise, I lighted on the passage to
j which the author directed hickory timber
er J intended for die cogs of wheels, to be cut
x. j when the sap was running, that they might
J not become powder pist"
x. j Co!. Pickering aJverts to the case of "a
rs i larmer, the well pole (or sweep) of whose
| veil happened to break at a very busy time,
:s, and to supply its place he cut down the first
rt. ; small ire", which came to hand ; and this
1!r j was a white birch. The sap then running
be I freely, he put up his pole, anJ it lasted sevs.
i enteen years Hud he put it up with the
be | bark on, it woulJ, probably, have rotted in a
,r. j year; the closeness of the bark would havi
ke! prevented the es ape of the sap. A close
?at1 coal ?f paint laid on unseasoned wood opn.
erates like the close birch bark, by con.
ar bning the sap, and hastening the decay."
!y ! Dryness is favorable, and moisture un
; favorable to the durability of timber. Greer
on I },nd growing timber has less moisture ir
<J | winter than in spring or summer; but it;
Ad i pores being less open in cold than in warn
L(j ; weather, it cannot so well become drj
rr ' befoie it becomes rotten. But in spring
n. summer, and perhaps the forepart o
b.j autumn, the pores of green wood are com1
pnrativcly open, tho moisture more casilj
; exuJes or escnpes provided said pores arc
sy j not sealed by tlie bark. If one wishes tc
j|t| j cut wood, and proposed to let it lie, withou
i being deprived of its bark, winter is his tim<
re with reference to durability. But if it ii
re proposed to strip the bark from the tree
ed the tlfne when the bark p^els most easily
t*s will, we believe, be the season in whiel
other things being equal, the timber wi!
%l. endure longest.

re is to leave the stumps on a level with the

Extractfrom the Secretaries Report.
It is proposed to divide the United States

the militia in each district, so as to have a body
of twelve thousand five hundred men in active j
.T V I
I service, and another of equal number as a |
j reserve. This would give an armed militia
force of two hundred thousand men, so drilledand
stationed as to be ready to take their places
in the ranks in defence of the country,
whenever called upon U oppose the enemy or
te;>el the invader. ' The age of the recruit to
be from 20 to 37 ; the whole term of service
to be eight years?four years in th first class,
and four in the reserve : one-fourth part, twenty-five
thousand men, to leave the service
every year passing, at the conclusion of the
first term, into the reserve, and exempted frotn
ordinary tnihtia duty altogether at the end of
the second. In this manner, twenty-five thousand
men will be discharged from militia duty
every year, and twenty-five thousand fresh
recruits be received into the service.?
It will be sufficient for all" useful purposes,
that the remainder ofthe militia, und?-r certain
regulations provided for the government, be
enrolled and be mustered at loug and stated
intervals; for. in due process of time nearly
! the whole mass oi the militia will pass through
t he first and second class, and be either mum.
bers of the active corps, or of the reserve, or
- counted among the exempts, who will be liable
to be called upon only in periods of invasion
or imminent peril.. The manner of^urolmen',
i the number of davs of service, and the rate of
? compensation, ought to be fixed by law; but

0 of real 'State to some facts which the writer
of th's considers a public nuisance; viz ;
Toe Town Hall for several nights in succession
h is been fitted up by a French juga
gl'-r to shew his feats of deception,-?now
n Sir, we 'were told when this house was
1 building 'hat it was intended for a Market
and Town Hall; and for this purpose we
nave been taxed (or two years to the extent
of the law to pay foi its erection. The
i house has been ercct'd with the people's
money and is rh- ir property. But scarcely
was it fiuish'-d before it wag let out for con
, cert-*; for the exhibition of an Albino and
k G ant; nnd now of a juggler; and in Vindication
of th s course we are told that it
will lessen our taxes. That he Town

mv protest that they have not the right to
I extort money from me even under the name

by pi tying on die credulity of the people.
We hear it Constantly urged that it is right
to rent ou: the town hall as it will put mo.

an equal right to put up a grog shop at every
corner of the public square and rent them
out to lessen the taxes; and although Such
a meusUro would deservedly receive the

yet, I think the effect on the morals of the

present course of the Council. And in
conclusion. I would remark that if the
Council are determined to desecrate the
Town flail in future by making it a pandc.
monium of vicious exhibitions, they will at
least excuse those from paying taxes for the t
building who are conscientiously opposed t

CONGRESSIONAL. <
Washington, Monday, Apr.113th.
In the House of Representative Mr. Adams
consumed the morning hour by an at- .
tempt to refer a series of Joint Resolutions
from the Legislature of Massachusetts, but
i they were iuid on the table by a vote of 104
! to 40. This subject cannot be revive i ai
tins session. The House has subjects enough
of party c.onttnl'ou before it, and U in
no humor to increase them.
At one o'clock, or soon after, the special
order to which precedences was given, by
resolution, was taken up?viz. the Civil and
Diplomatic Appropriation BillMr.
Wis spoke, with lfs usual earnestness,
in rejoinder to the remarks heretofore
made by Mr. Jones?reiterating Irs views
as to the ox ravagauce ol me Administration
He compared the extravagance of ihe pres.
ent and late Admin stations *Gtb the ecoir-L
. v* i
omyof John Quarry Adam's. When ieaeratism
was turned out of power and democracy
took its place at the political revolution in
1801, Mr JeffrsondiJ make a small* reduction
in the'expenses. H s whole expedites
were about two hundred thousand
dollars, less annually, than those of his predecessor.
But modern democracy increased
the expenditures to three times what they
were during John Qtnricy Adam's administration.
The expenditures had gone up
from 13 millions to 37 millions. G- n.
| Jackson spent 145 millions in his eight years'
I which was a great increase on tlx; previous
expenditure ; but Mr. Van Buren bud spent
112 millions in three years.
Ho compared the expenditures at different
periods with the population, to shew, that,
in regard to that test, expences had enormously
increased. The expenditures, in Mr.
Jeff rson's administration, if raised by cap
itntipn tax, would have been T06 cents a.
head ; in Mr. Madison's, including even the
war, i? would have been 2.33: in. Mr. Monroe's
1,36; in Jolm Q jinry. Adams's, 4.32 ;
in Mr. Van Bur n's 2,36?the last being
greater than-even the war adminifija ton of
Mr. M id.son. He had examined the de!
tai'a'of th- bill, and would not put his finger
on any unnecessary expences ; all he wanted
to do was to show that this bill was from
the executive, and that Congress whs nor
responsible for it. H" would go with his
colleague, howover, In any reducion thai"
ho would propose. If the advice of-jhe de.
par ments should be toRowed, anff MrTPbinsen's
standing army adopted, with an active,
force and a sedentary torce?he hoped all
the sedentary soldiers would become dys
nnnMr?cvpi 37 millions would not t>ay ex
r..w . pences.
Mr. Jones of Va. replied briefly. Taking
ihe strongest case put by his colleague,
he would show that there wag noJ tho leas!
ground for a charge of extravagance uguinst
this administration. His coHengue usked
him to uccount for an expenditure of37 mil.
lions ir. Mr. Van Buren's administration,
while Mr, Adams's was only thirteen. In
the year 1939, which he would take, the
gross aggregate expenditures of Mr. Van
Buren. were 39 millions ; in Mr. Adams/
in 1826, 24 millions, including tun millions
, for the public debt.
To account for this d fR-rence, he would
give the items of increase. In the first place
the army was increased?more 'ban two
millions were added there. Fortifications,
d*c. were increased, tho expenditures for
, the navy were Increased.?Mr. v? ise has
said he always opposed the increase of tho
army ; nnd as to the navy, though tho expense
had b- en increased, the Free afloat
had been diminished. Tho navy departmcnt
was in a worse condition now than it
was five years ago. If lie had his own way*
however, he would have expended twentyfive
millions on t ie uavy, if there was any
fair wav to raise it. But we had nothing
to show for the increased expences in the
navy.
Mr. Jones proceeded in his bit of items; ?
Ti?e increased expenses for the Indian
Deparment .were five millions?and no one
could say that these wpre unnecessary. The
prevention and suppression of Indian hos
tilities formed another item of four m llions.
Tne Administration could not be held accountable
for this expense, for there w?re
few in this House who would refuse npp opria'ions
to defend the frontier. The next
item was the building of roads, breakwaters,
p-ers, light.houses, dec. which had involved
a great increase, .
Mr. Wise?I suppose they are ail rght,
too.
Mr. Jones?N?>, St?these were put
upon us by-the Whigs?and we must bear
it as well as we can.
Mr. Wise?Were not those appropriations
made in pursuance of estimates from
the Departments 7 Was not Ihe fortune ot
our present M nisier at Si. Cloud?Lewis
Cass?'made by appropriations for harbors
on the I ikes, recommended by him ?
Mr. Jones could not be led off to a new
inquiry. He passed in the next i:em?
Pensioners and Revolut'onury Claims?in
which there was an increase of more titan
half a million. r
Mr. Wise here said that he knew the
f ict thai tlvre had been frauds in paying bai.
chums. while good claims were left .unpaid.
The public officers of this administration
had been guilty of the most gross outrages
in admitting claims that ought never to have '
n.ncopfh llwt rnncpniipni'n nf u ki?K I
'WWW ?ivw VWUJ< VI ?*|IIWU -*?? *?
even the good claims were now tainted.
Mr. Jones replie d that, if this was n foe,
the six Committees of this House,?majori-,
ties of each one of which were whigs,?
had been grossly negligent of duty in detec
.. 4-.
,in^ tl,e frauds,an'^ bringing their perpetra- 'Wl
;ors lo justice.
Mr. Jones pursued his items?making an
iggregate of fifteen millions to affect the bar*
ance against tin's administration. If he*
were to go ? little farther he could show
that tho diff-rence was but a trifle between
:he ordinary expenditures of 1839 and of
1836.
Mr. W ise insisted upon charging to tins
administration every item that his colleague
had attempted to offset.
Mr. Samuels of Vn., Mr. Stanley of N.
C., Mr. Hopkins of'Vn?and Mr. Wise conliuued
the discussion till five o'clock, when
the Committee rose und the House adjourn*
ed. In the latter part of the debate the subject
of abolition was introduced by Mr. Stanley,
aud as usual,?it ruised quite a row,
Mr. Hopkins took up the matter very earn-*
cslly, throwing the odium of abolition upon
the whigs. Mr. Wise rejoined, throwing *
t'u? charge back upon the administration.
Mr. Clay then rose and entranced tho
S n ltu Sy his eloquence?the manly, dignified,
and statesmanlike views which he tof?k on
the question. He said it there was any
party ready to advocate r war before we
ha I received the ultimatum from Britain^ .
that pai ty was a crim,nal jparly. As to the
question of right, it was with us, that was
not to he deified. Bui there were two mod<s
by whh h th'? mailer was to be settled?
ili? one was by negotiation, the other by
war?the first was with the executive brunch,

Tuesday, April 14.
Th?- Scna'e was a scene of intense iu'er.
est for an hour and a half in the morn in**. * ^
Mr. Buchurinn from the Committee on Foreign
Relations, made his report on the Mm,
sage of the President containing tho official
correspondence in relation to the dispu.
t"d boundary, and tho resolutions of tun
Legislature of M-dne in regard thereto.?.
This Report, on the whole, wag pacificatory
?it breathed u hope that nil our difflciiltiy*
might be amicably settled, and th??t
it was the duty of the country f<> wait
prtiently tho ultimatum from England,
which could not fail to reach us in all
prcsont or coming month. The dncu-i
menl breathes this wholesome spiriMhni "s?>
far as the Committee enn exercise any in.
fluence over the subject, they are resolved
that if war should be the result, which they
confidently hope may not be the case, tho
war should be rendered inevitable by the
conduct of the British Government. Thcv
have believed thut this is the surest mode of
uniting every American heart and every
American arm in defence of the just rights
of the country." After the paper was read,
Mr. Wright moved the printing of 10,600 extra
copies. Mr. Ruggles was not disposed
to oppose or advocate the printing of a large
number. There was a great anxiety oq
the part of Maine to bring this matter to q
close regardles of all consequences, 'fhero
was one thing Maine feared more than war.,
and this was the violation of her right and
the loss of national honor.
