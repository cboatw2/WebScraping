i,. determinied to have. Maine will concede
her Territory in qxchange for a conventional
right to navigate the St. John's River,. to- its
mouth, or she might give the Territory of that
River, in exchange for the Territory west of it.
The timber, concerning which so much noise is
made, will be of little use to Maine, without the
navigation ofthe St.John's. Our Government
has assumed the ground. that it will support the
r hts of Maine, as they have decided, by both
Houses of Congrees, unless .Maine herself
should consent to different terms, or unless a
different decision should be made by a new
empire,to whom Mr. Vau Buren is willing to
submit the case. But, with the assent of Maine,
the matter can be settled by neotiation, at Lon
dori. Even in the event o disagreement,
Frapce would probably offer her mediation, as
Englandoffered hers, between ur and France.
So, we shall get through the session, without
straining our resources by a preparation for
war.

TREASURY NOTE BILL
In debate on the Treasury Note Bill in the
House of Representatives, March 27, Mr.
Pickens made a few observations, which were
not prepared in time for Saturday's paper, but
have been since handed into the office, as fol
lows:
Mr. Pickens rose and said: Mr. Chairman,
I do not rise to inflict a speech, but merey to
join in the request of the gentleman from New
York (Mr. Monroe) that we should, according
to the-general understanding entered into yes
terday, before our adjournment, take the bill
out of Committee, and dispose of it finally to
night. in some way or other. I rise to make an
appeal to the good sense of the modrate portion
of allparties in this House.
This is a simpe bill authorizing the issue of
Treasury notes to the amount offive millions of
dollars. We have beard the statements or mem
bers of the Committee of Ways and Means, as
to the wants of the Government. Is there a
man here who is not prepared to give his vote?
Are we to sit here day after day, and night after
night, listening to the miserable hackneyed par
ty slang of the day upon a bill, on the merits of
which every man here is prepared to ve his
voteI My constitution is unprepa to go
through with these midnight scenes of confu
sion, and, I was going to say, of dis-race. I
do hope that the moderate men of l parties
will combine to take this bill out ofcommittee.
and'to pass or reject it, Sir, it is no time to sit
hereand dwell upon political newspaper para
graphs, and the miserable attacks and slanders
*ing out of the mere partisan contests ofthe
y0. We havelately heardand all [am sure with
deep pain, die present critical position which
we occupy in regard to a foreign Power, and,
resul from which, great and serious ques
tionswi press upon us.. I trust in God that
the peace ofthe country can be preserved, but
it is no time forus to waste our days and nights
in wrangling over these little matters, local in
their integpst, when there is such a great and
momentops question which may be pressed up
on the consideration of this country. I was
prepared to have voted against this bill,and was
disposed to do so, because I believe it to be an
unsafe precedent in legislation. I have so said
before, but not from any constitutional objec
tions. But if an exigency occurs, if the nece*
sity is palpable and plain, I will givethe Gov
ernment my support. It they need their credit
to maintain the Government, I am prepared to
give it. I solemnly believe, from the develop
ments of the last few weeks, that it may be ne
cessary, I am prepared to give my vote for
this bill under the circumstances in which the.
country is placed; but I do not say that there is
any immediate danger of a conflict. I trust in
God, 'not;, but I wilL say that it is by no means
ceiiain that the peaceo the country can be pre
sered, and I am for riving the Government
strength to support itsell in any emergency that
I*siheiai in the requestorthe gentlemai
from,6.w Yor,'(Mr. Monroe,) and I hope and
trtsst ,lt gentlemen are prepared to put an end
tohe dicussion, and, at all events, to take the
bill out of committee.
FaoM FJ.oantA.-The steamer Genera!
Clinch, Capt. Brooke arrived at this port
vesterday, from Garey's Ferry Black
Creek, (Florida,) having on board, as
aussengers, Capt. F. Searle, Assistant
Qtrarter Master, Dis. J. B. Wells, and -.
R. Arcold, all of the U. S. Army ; also
two Hospital Nurses.
We learn that Col. Twiggs had return
ed from a llfteen days scout up the St.
John's River, with the Blood Hounds,
which, it is stated, were found to be per
fetly useless-all atternpts to induce them
to take the trail of the Indians proving
nsuccessful.
Two Indians were discovered in a boat,
and shot-one of them said to be a brother
of Sam Jones-Chaleston Courier.
The Court of Sessions and Common
Pleas, for Barnwell District, commenced
its session, on Monday, the 30th March,
at 10 o'clock, and adjourned on Friday,
the 3d April, at half-past 11 o'clock, his
Honor, Judge. Gantt, presiding. The fol
lowing statement will show the number of
eases on the dockets for trial.
No. of cases for trial, - - - 748
*' " Tried, - - - 493
Notice of appeal but in one case.
Thus it will be seen that his Honor had
to encounter a docket, formidable for the
number of eases upon it; formidable also,
because a great number of those eases
were contested. But the Judge commen
ced, ad continued his duties with a zeal
and industry whieb enable him to get
through the whole bttsiness in the course
offour days, and thereby to confer an
essential benefit upon the district, and toi
reflect great honor upon himself.-lbid.
Accident.-The steam packet James
Adams, Ham, started this morning for
Columbia, and proceeed as far as the
bar, owing to the strong N. E. gale, she
was compelled to -return-on her way
back, off the lower end of the middle
ground, came in contact with pilot boat
iorithat was proceeding to sea, and
stove in the larboard side, when she imme
diately sunk. The 3. A. had all her fore
ends near the stern, stove in ; the crew of
the pilot boat were taken orfby the steam

A ship freighted with blacks by the
Colonization Society, has been overhauled
on the coast of Africa by a British Cruiser,
on suspicion of being engaged in the Slave
Trade. Well, 'we hope it will now be
discovered that when one government
assumes the right of violating the laws of
nations, they hold a weapon which cuts
more than one way. If the British wish
to monopolize the trade with Africa all
they have to do is to suspect the vessels of
all. other nations of favoring the Slave
Trade.-Chaleston Courier.

EDGEFIELD C. H.
THuRSDAY, APaRi 16,1840.
Death of Gov. Nob.-A letter received
by a gentleman in this place, gives an ac
count of the death of Gov. Noble.
We are informed that he died of dropsy
in the chest, on Tuesday the 7th inst. The
long and valuable public services of this
gentleman, are well known to all. He is
cut ofl'in the midst of his usefulness. At
the time of his decease, he was in the prime
of life, and the full vigor of intellect. He
was emphatically. an honest politician
and a good man. We hope that some one
competent to the task, will prepare a me
moir of this distinguished public servant.
In common with the whole State,we deep
ly deplore his untimely death.
MUNICIPAx. ELEcTIoN.-At an election
held in this place, on the 11th instant,
William 1. Simpkins was elected War
den of Edgefield, to fill the vacancy occa
sioned by the removal of A. V. Mont
gomery. .
We are indebted to the Hon. F. W.
Pickens, for a pamphlet copy of the
"Speech of Mr. Bynum, of North Caro
lina, on the resolution of Mr. Thompson
of South Carolina. on the subject of Abo
lition." This speech is one of considera
ble length and evinces great research. It
vindicates the Democratic party from the
charge of abolition. No impartial man
can read it and fail to be convinced, that
the Democrats, as a party, are laboring
with the most strenuous effortd, to put
down those political incendiaries, the abo
litionists.
TuE WEATHE.-The fifth of this
month was a bright and beautiful day.
There was a delightful calmness in the
air, and every thing augured well for the
future. But alas !
" A change came o'er the spirit"
of April, and the' bright sunshine was suc
ceeded by dark clouds, mnists, and copi
ous bhiowers of rain. For several days
during the past week, the rain poured
down almost continuously, and the weath
er very much resembled that of a wintry
month. Vegetation was greatly retarded,
and the young ,crops were much injured.
We have heard it said, that
"April showers,
Make May flowers."
A fig for such showers, say we, and such
cool breezes, as " have fanned our cheek !"
Give us the glorious sun-shiue, the warm
breath of summer, and away with the
mist in scotia born'! We carenot for the
Hyperborean winds which roar so music
ally in the ears of some. We have had
enough of them. We fervently pray for
the return of the delightful vernal season,
so celebrated by -the poets, but so rarely
enjoyed. Since penning the above, the
sky his brightened, and the Rain King has
fled howling away.
Several days since, we read the Speech
of Mr. Duncan,-of Ohio, "on the bill to
authorize the. issue of Treasury Notes."
Much the largest portion of the speech,
is taken up with the history of the Flor
ida War, from its commencement to the
present time. In reading the remarks of
Mr. Duncan, we were forcibly reminded
of the celebrated debate de omni bu rebus
et guibusdan aliia. which took place in
the Senate, some years since, and in which
our own Hayne and Mr. Webster partici~
pated.
in. these days of speech making, it is not
at all necessary for an orator to confine
himself to his text. He is privileged to
fly ofr from his subject, and discourse on
any thing that seemeth to him proper.
Many take the liberty, to speak on any
thing else, but the subject before them.
This is using the freedom of speech with
a vengeance.
We refer our readers to the Prospectus
of the " New Yorker," which will be seen
in another column. We have seen some
numbers of this paper recently, and have
found in them, an agreeable melange of Po
lite Literature, Politics, News, &c. There
is always to be found in this paper a page
of Music~. This must recommend it to
those who have "music in their souls," es
pecially the ladies.
SPEECH oP Ma. CALIoUN.-IWe pub
lish to-day, the first partof the Speech of
Mr. Calhoun, on this resolutions which he
introduced in the Sente on the 13th of
March. These resolutions muist com
mend themselves to the approval of all
parties, especially, to those who desire
the perpetuity of our Union, and the pre
servation of the rights of the Southern
States. The decision of the British Gov
ernment, in the case of the negroes. on
board the Enterprise, should not be tamely
submitted to by our Government. The
dearest rights of the South have been in
fringed, palpably and flagrantly, and she
will never acquiesce in such a decision.
We subjoin the comments of two lead
ing papers, on the Speech of Mr. Cal
houn. The Globe says
." Mr. Calhoun's Speech upon the prin
ciples invoniced in the negntin.tion with
Great Britain about the slaves withheld
from the Enterprise, is one. of the nmost
remarkable of thesessio..~ I has received.
high and deserved encomiums frem.mcti
of all parties. Its lucid reasonigs arejr-.
.resistible; and the a 'ninaidersion upon
the inconsistent attitudes assumed by
Great Britain, not merely in relation to.
her controversy with us, but in regard. ?A
her assumed position before the .world,
upon the subject of slavery, compared
with her actual condition,.is not less just
than severe.
The New York Evening Star, another
able and leading journal, says
" Letters from Washington unite in
giving a high and important charaeter to
the speech delivered by Mr. Calhoun on
the 13th. It was not on the abstract doe
trines of the Abolitionists, as some sup.
pose, nor the constitutional rights of the
slave States, bus of a more general charac
ter, predicated on the rights of American
vessels driven by stress of weather itto
friendly ports; and he maintained the ju
risdiction of the State to which such ves
sel belongs, over her rights and interests,
which can !ose none of those rights by be
ing forced into a friendly or neutral port.
This was carried out by reference to
the case of the brig Enterprise, the Enco
mium, and the Comet, vessels sailing from
one State to another State, having slaves
on board, sent from one plantation to an
other, and released by the British authori
ties of the islands, into the ports of which
these vessels were driven by stress of
weather. It is true, that'after many years
of negotiation, the British Government has
seen the expediency and justice in making
indemnity to the owners; but th6'Minis
try will not avow the doctrine, and estaibi
lish the principle that our vessels carrying
domestic Slaves from one State to another,
shall be released with their slaves, ifdriv
en by stress of weather, into their ports.
This right must be avowed openly and
unequivocally. It will never do to per
mit the Abolitionists of the North to con
federate against Southern rights gtaran
tied by the Constitution, and at the same
time to find them backed in their position
by the practices of the British Govern
ment touching the safety of Southern prop
erty, accidentally thrown into their ports.
Mr.-Calhoun's position is not disputed ,
and carried out with firmness and temper,
will show the British Government the n6
cessity of abstaining in every respect, from
being mingled up or participating in est
rying out the doctrines of this vexed ques'
ton."

believed that these, will not be acknowled

Winter at the North.-We learn by
passengers from Albany, that the storm of
rain and sleet which we had here on Tues
day last, was there a regular snow storm,
was about a foot on a level. The. Boston
papers also speak of a snow storm in that
vicinity, at the same time. Here the
ground was barely covered. The North

in Windsor, Goshen, Chesterfieldand Peru
is still from twoto seven feet deep. Parly

-. Editors and Publishers.
FTHE present flourishing trade, and the grow
.1. ing importance of Hamburg in a comm er
-ial point of view, fully authorize the estab
lishment ofsuuch a Newspaper as the Publishers
design to make of the Journal. No place of.
the same population in the Union, and certain
ly none where so large an amount of business
is transacted, is without such a vehicle of trade
and intelligence. Ever e'ort will be made to
render the Journal entirely acceptable to the
liberal and enterprising community for whose
patronage it presents itself. Political facts will
be given to the public as matter of news; but
political speculations, with their train of soph
istry, misrepresentation, slander and abuse,
will be carefully excluded from our columns.
Particular attention will be given toithe state of
the Markets at home and abroad; and we shtll
furnish regularly corrected lists of the prices
current at Hamburg, Augusta and Charleston,
as well as copious extracts from the Trade
Lists of the Northern cities. Our extensive
mail facilities will give as intelligence -from
every part of the Union at the latest possible
dates; and the means they will also afford usof
transmitting our paper speedily to every pst
office throuhout the South and South West,
will make the Journal useful and valuable to
the business men of these sections of our great
country, and we shall look with confidence for
patronage at their hands. We shall endeavor
to find a place in our columns for every thing
of interest to the business classes of the people
and the community generally; and, in short,
no expense or labor shall be spared to render
the Journal a truly valuable paper, and in every
way worthy of the favor and support we now
solicit for it.
Terms.-$5 per annum, in advance. The
Journal will be printed twice a week, with
good type, on beautiful white paper, of an ex
tra-imperial size. Advertisements inserted at
the usual rates.

W AS Stolen from my house, in Edgefield
District, S. C , on the 16th inst., a .ne,
heavy, Silver Lever Watch, with a gold key,
attachedbyablack, watercoloredribbon,which
was used as a guard-chain. The Watcb has a
high chrystal, with a small flat circle on'the
top, and two or three small notches 1- think,
where it joins the case.
The Watch was taken by a notorious thief,
in the presence of my Mother, late in the eve
ning of the day above mentioned. He passes
under various assumed names. Sometimes he
calls hiinself Stephen Bright, alias Tom Jones.
alias Woodsbury. He is dark complected, re
sembling a Spniard, has a heavy, black best,'
high, broad cheek bones, chin rather tapering.
He is about 5 feet, 5 to 8 inches high, and is
square shouldered. He is rather of a bony.
look. This thief travels on public roads as,*.
foot traveller, and on neighborhood roads, g9F-.
erally carries in his hand a bridle, which, he'
says is for the purpose of catching estray ho
ses. Whenever be enters a house he is always'
in a great hurry, and says that he cannot wait
for any preparation of meals; but if any thing
cold, or not cooked is at hand, he seizes it, and
decamps. He seldom, or never enters a house
at times when the male members are present.
It is probable that lie wilt pass as a begr
on foot, or a gentleman on horse-back, wherev
er lie goes. He is known to have stolen sev
eral horses, Watches and Pocket Books, and
brokeno n several houses, in the presence of
. a... -chadrew. ti1e-isais know"
to have called at several houses for..enter-.
tainment, and to have departed suddenly be
fore any thing could be prepared. Whenever
he enquires the distance to a particular placb;
he generally, or always takes the opposire
course, in order to evade pursuit, if it should
be made. $120 reward will be paid for hi'
detection and delivery in jail at Edgefield C. H.
$15 will be given for the recovery of the watch
alone. SAMUEL MARSH.
