J nndrr discussion, Mr. Kir.g of Georgia, says
I the National Intelligencer, and in a Sj>c er!i
I cfmorc than three hoars in length and much
! decision deliver'd his views of the various
! questions involved in the subject before tho
I Senate. The following presents ?. brief out[
line of seme points touched on in his in-costing
addicts, lie said he had feltgrent (.rah arras
tnent during the whole of the session in regard
| to the propositions of Mr. Rives and Mr. CalI
houn. He was not entirely in favor of either,
i He had been always opposed to the State bank
J system, and had predicted the disasters which
t have followed its adoption. He insisted that
j it had net only f i led, but was an entire failure
I from the bgining?a system of fraud and deception.
It produced speculations in the exch
au ires, by the officer? of the banks who were
expected to regulato them; tlie alleged facilities
of exchange were merely nominal; and he
adduced instances to sliow that shaving, to a
i It i
I groat extent upon tneir, n:?u ncen carrieu on.
j Tho Specie Circular had increased tho amount
| of shaving; and he adduced instances of enor ;
ruous profits divided, by the banks in the city
} of his residence. He expressed the belief that
the currency and exchanges, bad a9 they of
course were,made still worse by tho interposition
of the President.
Air. K. had been rather inclined to favor
the sub-treasury system, till the argument o
Mr. Benton convinced him of its inexpediency.
He ridiculed Mr. B's precedents, drawn from
tho Roman e np're, from Napolean,from .Spain,
and from Turkey, and characterized their financial
measure* as those of plunder, oppression,
and blood. Mr. Benton had entirely
frightened Mr. K. from the support of his subi
treasure svstem, as modified bv Mr. Calhoun.
Mr.K. expressed the hopo that he would
find himself able to support the present Administration;
but he mnst speak the truth. The
| message, he said, was greatly armneous in va'
rious pariculars, which lie proceeded to sh? w,
mostly from authentic statements and other
documents. By these he proved that the paper
currency in England had Cot been expanded.
as the message alleged; that thcro had
been no increase of speculation there; that the
value of tho currency there had been increased,
and not depreciated; that there had little
tr no augmentation of loans in England; that
no universal commercial distress had occured
there, oxcept what was owing to its commerce
with this country; and that in England there
had bee i no overtrading. Mr. K.. expressed
extreme regret that these errors of the message
bad gone forth to the world, aud been
believed as truth, win n there was no truth in
them. He deprecated the importations of
specie which had bee.i forced into this country;
and argued that ths forced mass, instead of
gofhg into tho circulation of the country, wont
into the banks, and served as the basis of excessive
paper issirs. The $30,000,000 of
foreign deb% in A/arch last, as stated by the
message, he thought an error, since more than
33*2,00(1,000 of such debt had been p ud since
that period.
Air. King then entered into an elaborate and
interesting financial investigation.toshoxv that
tho system adopted and acted upon by the Administration
had be.m a vain warfare against
tho natural order of things in commercial trans
actions. They had unnaturally forced gold and
sdvrr into the country from England, and then
endeavored to keep it here, despite of the nataral
causes which led it to flow backwards
and forwards; that, by this violent procedure,
the Bank of England had been obliged, in its
own defence,(in order to prevent its own vaults
being drained of all their specie,) to put a slop
to American credits, and call in its debts. If
H had not done so, it would have been forced
to suspend. Now, if the natural laws of trade
bad been allowed to prevail?if the merchants
of this country could have been allowed to obtain
specie to pa^ tha debt, and could have
remitted it t; Eag.'and,no embarrasment would
have fo'lowed; but the specio which they required
was drained away to the West by the
unnatural aud violent process oftho specio ciroular;
in consequence of which a scarcity of
specie was created on tha Atlantic boa.d. The
effects of the specie circular, while thus ruinous
to the commerce oftho Ea6t, were not less
disastrous to the trade aud busings of the
West. The banks there were drancd of epespecie
by its opera ion; it was, in fact, the
commencement of a general run upon tham,
began by tha Governmcntitsclf; a mostimpolitic
and fatal procedure. Thus embarresments
? -"I-.- nffomntinrr to
were crtJiueu uzi uu siucs, uj > ?>. ...
force things to flow unnaturally in channels
contrary t o the course and order of trade.?
Thus a run against the trade and trading institutions
of the country (and, by consequence,
against all the people of the country) was instituted
and carried on by the very Government
ot the country ilsolf, and against its own
country! a suicidal course which, perhaps, had
no parallel in the history of the world.
Among other positions, Mr K. brought forward
the following, which ho maintained by
j various arguments, and illustrated with cloar|
ness and force.
j 1. the banks are not insolvent m?ru!y because
j they do not pay specie. Specie is mado to
I an article ot merchandise?it is 110 longer an
| itom of currency. The premium which GovI
eminent has put upon it has driven it off from
I boing currency It u tor can become eurI
rcn and bo a currency so long as Government,
I by its exclusive measures 111 reference to spoJ
cio, forces it up at a premium; that if, to drive
it out of the general currency. It is now a
commodity kept in brokers' shops, ready for
sa.U1, as any other merchsndiso.
L 2. Tue adoption of hard money currency,
and the exclusion of a paper currency would
1 ha rounl to the confiscation cf one third of the
property of every individual of the country.
B. The paper currency of the country is not,
as it is represented by some, now depreciated
in value. On the contrary, it ha* risen in value,
and is now, at this moment, above tho valne
which specie bore before the suspension.?
For Jand, houses, and other property, can now
be purchased with good current bank notes,
for lees than tho same could have been purchased
before the suspension with gold or silver,
when, by tho relative excess of the curI
rency, it was less valuable than now. Therej
fore, paper is now at a lers depreciation than
I vrben there was a currency of gold and silver
and paper?that ic, Left ro tho suspension of
specie payment.
4' The results ol'iiio specie circular, by its
i acting in viola'ion of all the laws of exchange,
were rnosr ru:nu:i** Such were the results of
what the Senator from Missouri {Mr. Benton)
called the "gloriou*?glorious?spe'ie circu|
lar\'y [referring to the language use I by .1/r*
Benton a fowdiys ago] (Here r. B. nodded,
assent, and said 'vt-', g'ttrwus." We now,

He had grown up from his ealiest life a demo- the
j crat in habits and associations. .Mr. K. was a that

: cot tho word as a catch-word; he dispised the i
' catch-words. lie went for an economical ad- bell
| ministration, and no one should find him with shot

' f'.-om his vouth. and when he i pun;
! nrs' entered upon public life he found the Hank ! and
, of the United States established by the rioino. j mim
craf party. His party established this bank in T
i 1310; that was the remedy then proposed and arri<
i f.?und efficient; and from the time ofits astab- i
j lishment to >ho per:od when it was put down, V
j we had a currency better than any other na- | of a<
tion was ever blessed with. Such an insti- j Si
j tutiondn fact, seemed necessary to the Govern- j tion
j mont of th j country. Xo country having u j orde
j mixed currency could do without it. It was ; 7
! necessary to trust the finances of the country to ; up, 1
! ngency. The fate of this bank, estab-} ed.
Jished by the democrati cparty,\Ir.K. said,was Si
i extraordinary; and he proceeded to show the cupi
: injustice and inconsistency of the Administra- ing
! lion towards it. If Mr. B:ddle lay down, he Ad
I was useless; if he stood up, he was impudent; olec
j if he sat down, he was suspicious. If he ex- fron:
J panded, he was bribing the country; if he con for
tractcd, he was ruining the country. If he im- A1
ported specie, he was speculating upon the way
country; if he exported specie, he wasconspir- ban!
ing against the country. In short, whether he on tl
passed above or below the President, he equal- T
ly muddied the water. M. K. referred to au lour
? %? XT I t 4
; attack on trie bank by .nr. ues, ror not e*- whh
porting specie in 18JW, and compared that with neai
tlielate p -licy of the Administration in regard to jour
the fiportatian of specie. In truth, Mr. K. S
went on to say, that institution had,by shipping in c<
five miilions of specie, performed an operation tee
more favorable for this country than ever could Ban
be uxpectcd:rom an institution which had been M
warred against as it had been. this
Mr. K. referred to all these things to vindi- iugi
cafe himself and others who had always enter- aha!
taincd these opinions of the bank; and not men
meaning to indicate any course on his part in fid
relation to a bank variant from the opinions of tion
theraass of his constituents, which, when he Mr.
