We call attention to the appeal of the Academical
Society to be found in our advertising columns.
We hope that, hard as the times arc, our town will
not be subjected to the reproach of selling the
commodious houses built for Academics by the
contributions of the citizens. Money is scarce at
this time, but the creditors of the Society would
probably extend still further the liberal indulgence
which they have already granted, provided they
saw a prospect of receiving the money due them
within some reasonable time, without forcing the
sale of of the buildings. Subscriptions payable in
small instalments might, or at least ought to be I
taken up that would meet the present engage- j
ments. Tl?c buildings and lots are worth at least
twice the amount of the debts; and it is the inter- |
est of the community, and especially of parents i
who have children to educate, to save them from '
being sacrificed.
Recklessness of Party Sjurit.?In both '
branches of the Legislature of Massachusetts political
parties are nearly balanced. According to
the constitution of the State a majority of all the
votes cast is necessary to constitute an election.?
In Whatciy county the vote stood, for one candi
date 1W, for another 117, for a third 1 and for a j
fourth 1. Of course no one was elected, and the 1
selectmen (or managers) fo decided, and refused i
" ' 1* J , IJ..4 i
to give a certificate to any 01 trie canuiuuu-s. uui t
the man who had the highest number of votes
went forward and took his scat without crcden- !
tials. The intrusion was soon discovered and his
scat vacated; but what is most remarkable in the j
case is that the whole party to which he belonged j
voted in favor of his retaining Ins scat, although j
they profess to be peculiarly and preeminently the '
people's friends and the friends of such constitu- i
turns and governments as the people may adopt.
We learn from the Charleston Mercury that his
Excellency Gov. Hammond has appointed Mr.
Ri'Ffin, late Editor of the Farmers' Register, to (
make an Agricultural Survey of the State, which j
was authorized by the Legislature at its recent '
session. We congratulate the Agriculturists of the j
State on this selection. The practical t dents and I
discriminating good sense of Mr. Ruffin, his long j
cx;>criencc as a planter, and tiic devotion to tiie i
subject evinced by him as editor of the Register,
eminently qualify him for the duties of the office,
lie was to be in Charleston on the 28th instant,
to confer with the friends of the survey in regard to j
the mode of conducting it.
A shock of an earthquake which was felt in the j
upper part of this State, and in parts of Georgia,
on the night of the 4th instant, was also felt in J
Ohio, Tennessee and Missouri. In Memphis, i
Tenn. and St. Louis, Mo, much alarm was
caused. In the latter town a congregation usscm.
bled in one of the churches was thrown into great
commotion. The chimney of a house not tar from
the church was thrown down by the earthquake.
Commodore Jones has been recalled from the

In Massachusetts when no candidate for 1 lie , 1
talc senate receives a majority of all the votes i,
given the election of a senator for such district is I'
to be made by joint ballot of both brunches of the j 1
fate legislature. At the election of last fall seve- ;
ral senatorial districts failed to make elections, hut j
of those which did make elections the Democratic j
?najority was so great that, on joint ballot, they '
gave the preponderance to that party, who of course
supplied the vacancies in the senate; although the 1
Whigs had a majority of three in the popular
branch of the legislature.
Neither of the candidates for Governor rcecivcd <
a majority of the popular voles. The election 1
therefore, devolved upon the legislature, who elect- j
ed Marcus Morton over Gov. Davis by a 6mall 1
majority of . Morton had a plurality of 1,257 j {
over Davis at the popular election.

There is now exhibiting in Charleston what s;
purports to be a mermaid said to have been taken G
near the Fecjcc Islands. It has been exhibited in tl
the northern cities, and of course drew large crowds
of spectators. It is enclosed in a glass box where I'
visitors are permitted to s^e but not to handle it. ,S
A correspondent of the Charleston Mercury pro. c<
noimecs it a hninbug, and proposes as a test of his re
opinion that a committee of scientific gentlemen {>;

it is"really a dead mermaid or a vunkee inauufac- ti

I We copy from the Globe the tallowing remarks J
by Col. Campbell, on the report from the Com- ,
mittcaoT Ways and .Means on the Exchequer j
! scheme of the President. The report recom. i
mended that the bill from the Treasury Depart- |
ment on the' subject be not adopted, mid gave rise
to a debate, in which the Whigs who spoke professed
their continued preference for a Dank, and
the Democrats their preference for a Subtrcasury:
"Mr. CAMPBELL, of South Carolina, did |
not rise for the purpose of discussing the exchequer '
project, more than once recommended by the
President, and now reported upon unfavorably by
the Committee of Ways and Means, further than
to say that, in his opinion, it was by no means the
most preposterous proposition that has been submitted
to the consideration of the American pco
Dinnnniicatcd to this Government, and for the M
:asons which led to the adoption of the article Ci
roviding for the African squadron. The Prcsi- lit
cut expresses his surprise at such a demand, par- se
cularlv as coming from the body which h id, hy a
r-r majority, ratified tlint treaty. hi
I
pie , since quesuons connecieu wan uic >-u,
have occupied so much of their attention. Even :
if its merits could be demonstrated, it would probably
have but little prospect of success in a ConI
?rcss, almost every member of which is pledged, ,
| by his previous course, to some other proposition,
i He had merely risen with the intention (without
entering into the discussion at length) of indicating
to his constitaents the coarse which he should
probably hereafter pursue in connexion with subjects
of this character.
Mr. C., as his speeches sufficiently testified,
I had been always favorable to a separation of the
! Government funds from the uses of banks; but,
when that proposition, so correct in principle, had
' been connected with another, requiring the public
dues to be collected exclusively in specie, he had
invariably voted against it?believing that such a
requirement was calculated to increase the pressure
on the commerce of the country, already almost
too great to be borne.
Since that question, however, was last agitated
in Congress, a change has occurred. Bank circulation,
without any oppression on the part of the
Government, has gone on gradually decreasing,
until, in many of the States, the circulation is reduced
below the specie actually in their vaults.?
Under these circumstances, Mr. C. believed that
the separation of the Government funds from the '
business of trade, even if connected with the requirement
of specie, or Government credits, cxclu- J
sively, in payment of the public dues, would now 1
be accomplished, without producing a shock upon '
the commerce and industry of the country. '
He had made these remarks, not because lie ox- 1
pectcd, during the existence of the present Con- (
gross, to change his vote in relation to this subject;
for having been elected by bis constituents with a '
knowledge of his previous course, he would scarce. ;
ly feel himself at liberty to do so. But be wished *
to indicate to them, by the remarks he had sub. '
mitted, that in the event of being returned to the '
next Congress, he would, unless a change occur.
red in our monetary affairs, probably act with the '
Democratic party on tills subject, as he had upon '
most others. !

Mr. Clay has been in New Orleans for a few 1
weeks on private business. He was received and
is treated there with extraordinary marks of re- j <
spect. The display on his r: ception was said to j <
be the most magnificent ever made in that city, i '
Committees from Mobile and Augusta have invi- . i
ted him to visit these cities before iiis return j
home, and he is expected to do so. A public ; *
meeting was also held in Charleston on the 17th *
instant, for the purpose of manifesting their re- ! 1
spect for his character and public services, and in- t
viting him to visit that city also. The Hon. :
IIk.nry Middle rox presided at the meeting, and
it was addressed by Messrs. Bit van", Pettigru, 1
Ykadon and Cohf.n. A committee of 26 were s
appo:nted to invite Mr. Clay to visit Charleston.
A letter is published in the newspapers from
Mr. BrcKiNUHAM, the former traveller and lecturer a
I
in this country, dated Limerick, Ireland, Oct. ; c
1st, 1812, in which lie states that although he had ' o
? i .
been in Ireland three months, and had travelled d
through the counties of Wicklow, Wexford, Kil- h
kenny, Watcrford, Cork and Limerick, he had o
not seen a single drunken person. This is a part *
of the country in which drunkenness was a few ti
years ago very common. The change is ascribed n
lo the recent Temperance reform, which spread in : 1
that country more rapiJly than even in this. d

CONGRESS. r
In the House of Representatives a bill passed on h
the 17th to repeal the Bankrupt Act, by a vote of 1 f,
110 to 71. Several attempts were made to mo- n
dify it, with a view of saving it, but they failed. J ft
It is considered certain that the bill will pass the ' n
Senate. The House, at the date of last account,
ivas engaged upon the bill making appropriations j
for the army.
In the Senate, nothing of special interest is do- J ^
ng. Considerable time is taken up daily in re- : y
iciving petitions, and sometimes in discussing ' b(
hem. On the 14th, a fierce attack was made j in
ipon the independence of the Judiciary, by Mr. j C?
r.\rPAN', wiio offered a resolution proposing an j Sl
imendmcnt to the constitution limiting the term 1
if the judges of tlic U. S. courts to seven years, j
SJe. contended that inasmuch as the people in this !
:ountry are the sovereign power, the judges and all 1
>ther officers ought to be made immediately sub- 1 ft,
cctto their will. Why not then abolish all gov- ! X
rnment except that of popular or Democratic as. w
emblics? This is the result to which the lion. ' vi
senator's principles lead. The resolution was, j IC
lowcver, put to sleep ; but it received the support sj,
f eleven Senators, viz. Messrs. A llex, Benton, pj,
k'CH.v.nan, Fl lto.n, Linn, Sevier, Smith of Conn.,
Iturgeon, Tappan', Wilcox and Woodburt.?

Correspondence of the Charleston Courier. j la
Washington, Jan. 11. j c(
It has been rumored to-day, that the President ! si;
. ill, to-morrow, send a message to the House, ask- til
ng an inquiry into the charges upon which it n<
ras proposed to impeach him. But whether tiiis (In
an be true, I know not. Ilis friends arc quite (j
rilling that the attempt should be made, sup- 1 re
osing that it would excite public sympathy in i til
is favor and react against the whigs; and it is ! tu
aid that Messrs. Black, Colquit and Cooper, of j in
leorgia, voted for the resolution of Mr. Bolts o:i et
lis ground. ea
A singular message was received from the \v
'resident to-day, in rcp'y to the resolution of the ly
enatc, asking whether the Quintuple Treaty was ; \ (J
TV Senate refused, by a vote of 17 to 22, to
order the printing of hii extra number of the report
of the majority and minority of the Committee on
the Judiciary on the subject of General Jackson's
fine. It in evident that no bill on the subject will
pass at this scsssion. The majority of the whigs
will not agree to put the bill in such a shape as
will, in their opinion, reflect uj>on the motives of
Judge Hall; and Genera! Jackson's friends will
not accept a bill which proposes chiefly to relieve
him, in virtue of his public services.
In the House to-day, the subject of the fine wan
discussed, during the morning hour, by Mr. Butler,
of Ky., who was an aid-de-camp of General
Jackson, and who warmly advocated the instruc.
tions passed for the Committee on the Judiciary.
Mr. Kennedy, of Md., stated that the Committee
on Commerce had under consideration a bill
establishing a warehousing system ; and offered a
resolution calling on the Secretary of the Treasury
for information in aid of their labors.
The Reports from the Committee on Ways and
Moujis on the Exchequer were resumed; and Mr.
Underwood, of Kentucky, spoke his hour, dwelling
much on the state of !hc currency and the necessity
of resorting to a National Bank, as the only
remedy foi its disorders. Mr. U. also took a
view of the prospects of the Whig party. He
contended that it was not dead as some had declared.
Those who declared it to be prostrate
were actuated more by their hopes and fears than
by their convictions. As to the New York election,
which had been relied on as a proof of the
fact, it proved only that the Whigs staid away
from the polls. There were forty thousand votes
less than in 1840. These forty thousand did not
vote, because they saw no prospect of advancing
the Whig cause and promoting Whig policy.?
The same thing occurred in Ohio. There the
Democratic Governor was elected by a minority.
The Whigs were kept from the polls by the conduct
of the " guard" and by the " constitutional
fact." The Whigs would learn wisdom and ex.
pcricncc, and they would select no candidates in
1841, .whose principles were doubtful. All the
disasters of the party grew from the election of
John Tyler. He was taken with a view to carry
the .State of Virginia, and the result was a just
judgment upon the Whig party for making such a
election. He firmly believed that the Whig par.
ty would be stronger in J 841 than in 1810. He
hoped that one party or the other would triumph,
and that the policy of the country would be based
an more settled principles, and not be left to shift
with every breath of faction, and be subjected to
the interests of office-seekers. The Whigs would
again rally uj>on their principles, which were the
atablishment of a sound and uniform currency ;
the distribution of the proceeds of the public lands;
md the curtailment of Executive power.
Mr. Everett, after some remarks to the same
jffcct, moved the previous question ; but he withdrew
it to permit an amendment to l>e offered so
altering the resolution as to declare that the Exchequer
plan "ought to he adopted" striking out
lie word "not,"
Mr. Winthmp moved to lay 1he whole subject
>n the table: and Mr. Cashing moved to refer it
o the Committee of the Whole House on tinState
of the Union : at this stage of the proceed,
ngs the sitting terminated.
Mr. Grccnough, the sculptor, is here; and has
dated that lie cannot find a proper light for his
tatuc of Washington in the Rotunda. The light
icing vertical, casts a shade upon the lower feaurcs
of the face, and gives the statue an appearincc
of constraint.
lie proposes to remove it to the open groundson
he west of the Capitol, and to ihrow up a suitable
itructurc of stone as a shelter.

in their salaries, arising from inade

ity (previous to last year) has always reston
those who were. The Society now
nsistsoffew in number; and at a meeting
nvened 'his day, it wa9 resolved to sell the
:ademical Lots and Buildings for the purse
of paying the above debt; unless some
:asures arc promptly adopted by the comjnity
to discharge the same. Most, perhaps
, the members of the Society are understood
be willing to co operate with their fellow

to do it without their assistance.
The 10th day of next month is fixed for

creditors) put their veto upon it.

j It has passed into a custom to assert that
dress is a matter of trilling importance; but
this every lady knows to be utterly false.?
Taste in dress is universally felt to be the index
of a thousand desirable qualities in woman,
while a deficiency in this respect always
injures one in the estimation of strangers, and
even of her intimate friends; the beauty of
j Helen and the wit of Aspasia would hardly
commend to general favor an acknowledged

?
This useful office, already filled for fourteen
, years with universal acceptance by the Lady's
i Book, the publisher pledges himself to disi
charge in future in a style surpassing ail hit
j former efforts. The ladies know perfectly
, well that our Magazine is the highest au,
thority in fashion. No lad/ considers
, herself well dressed who contravenes thia au,
thority, and in our own city. New York, Bc*ton,
Baltimore, Cincinnati, Louisvil'e, Lexington,
St. Ixjuis, New Orleans, Mobile, Charles,
tori, Savannah, and the other Metropolitan
Cities of the various states, the tasteful Fashion
PJ?fes of the Lady's Book dictate the
Laws of ??re6?.
In future the figures will be thrown into
tasteful groups, displaying the graces of dress
to the best advantage; and the back grounds
f of the plates will present intorestmg views
, designed by first rate artists,
i As a further assurance of thorough excellence
in this department the publisher has
secured the services of MISS LESLIE,
who will illustrate the Fashion Plates in her
usual felicitous aud graphic style, uniting %
thorough knowledge or tue subject
with a clear, intelligible and graceful manner
of treating it. Her descriptions are worthy
of tho productions of her own glowing pencd,
which drew the earliest Fashion Plates for the
Lady's Book.
The Publisher's correspondent in Paris is
possessed of such ample means of obtaining
, the real and present Paris Fashions, and of
transmitting them in advance of all competi^
tors, that the Ladies may continue, as they
f have always done, to copy from our plates that
- lias received the sacntion of ISDISPVTABLE

fashions, fresh frcm Paris.
The arrangements for producing}*] meet
brilliant and attractive series of Mezzotint and
Line Engt avings are now complete. Pictures
fresh from the easels of our first rate American
Artist* are now actually in the hands of
the ablest American Engravers, the subject*
embracing not only the usual popular and domestic
topics, but others which are interwoven
in the very heartstrings of
