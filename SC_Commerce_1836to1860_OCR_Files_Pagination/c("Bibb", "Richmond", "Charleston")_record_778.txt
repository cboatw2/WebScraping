* The Rev. Thohas-Mortimer, who was re
ceived with loud applause, said,—The resolution
which I have to propose is one which I confess 1
am thankful has fallen to my lot, because it con
tains sentiments to which my whole soul, my
heart’s blood, responds. (Cheers.) It is as fol
; ’ lows:-— ■ v ' • -
“ That this Meeting delights publicly to recognise,
as fellow-labourers in the work of the world’s evan
gelization, the several Protestant and Evangelical
Missionary Societies in Europe and America, as well
as the Societies for the conversion of God’s ancient
people to the faith of Christ; and affectionately
. sympathises with them in those trials to which their
faith and patience are occassionally subjected, while
it rejoices in the good which the Great Head of the
Chnrch is pleased to effect by their united endeav
ours, and looks forward with joyful anticipation to
.the period when both Jews and Gentiles shall all be
gathered into the fold of the gospel.”
Now, Sir, I will not take half an hour;—but
if I may be allowed to explain, the sentimep*'
which this resolution embodies, perhaps yoHwll
- allow me ten minutes. (A laugh.) I cop*88 that
when I entered this room, I really no idea*
i of speaking. I saw other person* with papers
! in their hands, and I thought to myf5^ ‘lam very
nicely out of it.’ (Laughter**did not think
I should have had to addre** You i and although
iHvould be a great unto**t0 say I never preach
ed a sermon without great deal of preparation,
yet I will say^tfi had expected to be called upon,
I would have tried to prepare something. But,
Sir, who could prepare a speech, whilst that In
dian bishop was addressing you? It was alto
gether out of the question. Oh, how I did feel,
and how did you, when he gave the account of
the stricken deer 1 I said, “ That is the sort of
preachingwe want.” (Cheers,—which interrup
ted the speaker.) I have only ten minutes allow
ed, so pray give me it all. Not a word. Let
me have my nine remaining hainutes, and you
shall have your’s afterwards. (Laughter.) “ Oh,”
i tnought, “ to bring a sinner to God is worth all
Qphe world. To turn a sinner from the error of
his ways, oh that’s the thing.” And then, the
clear work of conversion; on, that’s the matter,
as my good old" mother used to tell me when I
first began to preach. When I was a country
curatd^ and she came to see me, she said, “ Mind
you preach it clearly, my Tommy,”—(cheers,)
—these were her words ; let them see how a sin
ner may be brdught to God; and, when they are
convinced of sin, don’t be satisfied till they taste
the blessing of pardon.” Now, Sir, this is what,
. in my simple humble way, I have been trying to
preach. I don’t conceal from you what is the
truth. I wanted to be a poor Methodist preacher,
—but my father would not let me. “ No,” said
he, “ you shall not; if you wish to preach, you
shall preach in the Church of England, as your
elder brother does, or you shall not preach at all.”
I sat down and cried. (Cheers.) I have al
'ways tried to preach a simple gospel, a clear
gospel, as far as I know it. Do not let me'be
supposed to reflect on my Church. You may
say what you like, but I will never consider
the, Wesleyan Methodists anything but united
members of the Church of England. No, I
would not reflect upon my own body. I have
received kindnesses Irom them which I shall
never forget. I have received, I am sure, from
his Grace the Lord Primate, and from the Lord
Bishop of London, in the days of my affliction
and distress,—when, like Wesley, I was almost
ruined, not by building a meeting-house, certainly,
but by altering one,—(laughter)—I have re
ceived kindnesses from them, which I never can
forget, and I could lay down my life for either
of them, they were so kind to me in the day of
my trouble. But why do I come here to day?
Because one of them has been advancing a state
ment, which, although I love him, and would
lay down my life for him, I would rather die than
propagate. (Loud cheers.) No, my dear friends,
I feel that the times call upon the clergy, who
“ love our Lord Jesus Christ,” to show that, be
cause they love him, they love all that belong to
him. Yes, my Christian friends. At the same j
time, I say this, that there are a great many mem
bers of our established chureh, who, though, they
do not come into your public meetings, and have
nothing to do with your missions, do love all that
love Jesus, and I demand that thpy have credit for
it. (Applause.) Now the first part or this aub
ject,—it is a long text, and if I preach a sermon
it will not be my fault, but I will try not to preach
a long one,—(laughter, and cries of “ go on,”)
—the first part of this subject is recognition; the
second is sympathy; the third, joy; and the fourth,
hope. Now what is recognition? It is this,—
“that this meetinjjjdelights publicly to recognise,
as fellow-labourers in the work of the world’s
evangelization, the several Protestant and Evan
' gelical Mission ary Societies in Europe and Amer
ica.” Now, when I heard my own dear, kind,
benevolent, generous-hearted, high-minded Bish
op tell me, in St Paul’s, that “ the clergy of the
--• Church of England are the only true ministers
of Christ in Englandif it had not been that I
Jett it would violate public order, Lwoufo have
stood up and said,—“ My Lord, I don’t believe
a word of it.” (Tremendous cheerimr.) I could
have given this as my answer,—“ It pleased God,
by the preaching of the Wesleyan Methodists,
to bring my poor soul out of darkness into light,”
(cheers,)—and, remembering that, and all that I
owed under God was to that, I could have said to
him, “ My lord, if it had not been for my good
father, who would not let me be a Methodist
preacher, I should now have been in City-road,
instead of St. Paul’s.” (Cheers.) I assureyou
the feeling among us is this, that all who love
Jesus are dearto us; and I only give you back
your own words when I say, I do recognize you;
and I say, if you want to convince a Churchman’
I will' give you an Archbishop’s pill for him’
(Laughter.) Give him Archbishop Whateley’s
book, and let him read that. There is a good
deal, of capital Oxford logic in it, and it will
satisfy any reading, thinking man, who chooses
to think fairly, that the monstrous doctrine of
Apostolical Succession, as held and taught by the
Tractarian party, is all humbug. (Great cheer
ing.) Well, we recognize you:
“ Kindred in Christ, for hie dear sake,”
wherever we are we’ll say to you,
“ A hearty welcome here receive.” (Cheers.)
That is the first thing. The second in sympathy
in the trials which the Protestant missions have
been called upon to encounter: and here one
text may be enough. We believe in the Bible,
'<arid we believe that if one member suffers, all the
members suffer with it; and that is the reason
why we feel so much about the Tahiti mission.
I cannot bear to hear persons speak, as I have
heard some:—“We shall see a nice end to all
these sectarian concerns.” The work that has
been begun, trusting upon Him, shall go on pros
pering and to prosper. We do feel, that “who
ever doeth the will of mv Father who is in hea
ven, the same is my mother, and sister, and broth
er;” and it is a great shame in any family, when
u poor brother has got a bad coat on his back, or
is spit upon by an ungodly world, to say, “he is
l»jot n.y brother.” No. I should say, “ Come
Tfltt^William—you are my brother—we have
one common father—let us remember him, and
love one another the world reproach those
- who love Jesus,'tye. aS’*Swi£liar1S) must onjy
love them the more. ■ (CheersT3***^ lg
joy as ■'well as sympathy. Yes,—if we
with those who weep, we are to rejoice with those 1
who rejoice. I do rejoice in the goodthat your
missions have done, and are doing;* I did yes
terday, what I never did before,—what I have
never done since I have been in holy orders, now
more than a quarter of a century. But the high
tractarian men force us to come and declare our
sentiments. We cannot help it. (Cheers.) I
went, on Thursday, to hear the President of the
Conference at the Centenary , I got be
tween two windows, in order,,** he shaded from
the light, thinking I shouKnot be known; and
when they began a goo^ old Methodist hymn, it
did my heart good, ^'d I could not help singing
it. When I got >om#and told my children, they
said, “ Papa, did you not let us go with you.”
(Cheers.L-*M1d> “Well, we’ll see.” Now,oh
Sundav. ^ had two charity sermons at my own
chap**) and I knew I should not be wanted in
twmoming, and I therefore went, with my fam
ily, to Queen-street Chapel, where the' proceed
ings gave joy to my soul; and when I got home
my children said, “ Papa, our organ was nothing
to their singing.” (Cheers.) Now don’t take
this for flattery. All that I hope for the Wesley
an Methodists is, that they will be trueto those ho
ly sainted men who have gone-before them;—all
that I hope is, that they will remember those
who, through faith and patience, now inherit
the promises. (Cheers.) I shall never forget
Old Walter Griffiths. I have him now in my
eye. I can remember when I told him I want
ed to be a Wesleyan preacher. He said “Don’t
be unhappy my boy, it is all right." I said
“What is my duty?” “ Duty!”—said he,—
“ submit to your father.’’ I don’t regret that I
did; and I never should have taken this part,
if thege tractarian people had not begun to say,
that none but episcopally ordained ministers
were the true ministers. I should not take the
course I do, but that they force me to do it
(Cheers.) I remember your old preachers, I
bless God I ever heard them, and I trust you
will remember to walk in their path. When
good old Walter Griffiths was at Leeds, I wrote
to him from my first curacy, begging him to
come and see me. I said “ I cannot offer you
my pulpit, but I offer you my house and heart—
come.” The dear old man wrote me a letter, in
reply, which I shall never forget; saying—“ I
remember the love of your youth, but I thought
the old Methodist preacher was probably forgot
ten.” Oh, no; he never was forgotten,—he nev
er will be forgotten. (Cheers.) One word
more, and I have done;—that is, looking forward
with joyful anticipation to the period when all
shall be gathered together into the fold of Christ.
I quite agree with your excellent President, who
said there was no cause of alarm. No. He
thought it was a proof, he said, when Antichrist
ragea, that something was being done. Now,
your venerable founder,—(so my good old moth
er told me,)—once said to her, he almost doubted
his call to a place, where they did not meet him
with brickbats; but, wherever they did meet him
with brickbats, he had no doubt of his call there.
(Cheers and laughter.) No, I am certain the
enemy rages, and is confident that the work of
Christ is carried on by the Church Missionary
Society, by the Baptist Missionary Society, by
the London Missionary Society, and though last
not least, by your own Society, as well as by oth-1
ers. The devil fears the effect of it. (Cheers.)
Yes, and he may depend upon it, that the effect
of this opposition will ultimately compel those '
who stand behind and say nothing, to push for
ward, and make them say what they really think.
(Cheers.) Still I wish to be very civil. It is
said of John Wesley, that he once met a rude
blustering fellow, who intended to push against
him and knock him down. The blustering fel
low said—“I never make way for a fool.” “ I
always do,” said the venerable' man. (Laugh
ter.) Now, though these men come, and are
very rude, be you very civil, and don’t be afraid.
(Cheers.) I have now exceeded the time allow
ed me. (Cries of “go on.”) No, I will not.
(Laughter,) These are your goings on, and not
mine. ([Continued Laughter.) Letme conclude
by quoting the words which were written by
Charles Wesley to George Whitefield. I will
not give you a long extract;—I will give you a
very short one; the words which I am about to
quote will, I hope, justify a member of one
CprlBiian denomination in coming and acknowl
edging the members of another: -
Not by a party’s narrow bank confined, ’""
Not by a sameness of opinion joined,
But cemented by the Redeemer’s blood,
And bound together in the heart of God.
(Cheers.) I trust this will actuate you, and I do
feel as Dr. Steinkopff has well observed, that the
howling of wolves will drive the sheep nearer to
the fold, and nearer to the shepherd. (Cheers.)
I regret that I shall not be able to remain during
the whole of this meeting, but I rejoice that I
have had this opportunity of testifying my love
to my Saviour, my honour to my departed parents,
and my respect to Mr. Reece, one of the dear
friends of my old father, whom I heartily take
by the hand. (Cheers.) I not only rejoice in
being able to testify my regard in this manner,
but I will add in the language of scripture,
“ Grace be with all them that love our Lord
Jesus Christ.” (Loud and prolonged cheers.)
SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN ADVOCATE.
FRIDAY, JUNE 16, 1843.
X\THE SEVENTH VOLUME.
We begin a new volume of the Southern Chris
tian Advocate with flattering prospects and cheer
ing encouragements. One hundred and eight
new subscribers have been put upon our list Bince
the first of June, and every mail brings fresh con
tributions. One hundred and seventy were receiv
ed during the month of May. - A large proportion
of these have already paid in advance ; the restare
said to be perfectly good for the subscription price.
This is evidence which we think will satisfy our
venerable friend, the Rev. Lewis Myers, that the
preachers who held up their hands on the confer
ence floor, to sustain the publication and enlarge its
circulation, have pretty effectually kept their hands
up since conference. We thank them heartily for
such a mark of their confidence ; we thank them in
behalf of the Methodist E. Church, whose charac
ter, and interests, and institutions they can only
better serve by the direct work of the ministry.
While engaged energetically and efficiently in this,
their calling is the highest and holiest on earth.
They will not, however, overlook, or lightly esteem,
the aid which a vigorous and well-working weekly
press may furnish them, in carrying on the great
work to which their life and labours are devoted.
The volume on which we now enter, will, per
haps, be the chronicle of more important events than
have taken place for many years |in Christendom.
The tractarian controversy verges towards its cri
*tg^Puseyism has tong since passed the half-way
house; the punctum salient of the Reformation,
the Thermopylae of Protestantism, is beleaguered.
The battle is pushed to the gate; and it remains to
be seen whether church principles or vital Chris*
tianity shall be left master of the pass of tri
umph,.the key of victof^. In this conflict Metho*
dism can occupy no neutral ground. To her it
is necessarily matter of life or death. If the re
ligion taught by Dr. Pusey, and embraced by the
majority of the English bishops and clergy, and
by not a few, we fear, in our own country, be
the true form of Christianity, then that taught by
John Wesley is false and a thorough delusion.
And vipe versa. This trial, as Mr. Isaac Taylor
thinks, cannot be long continued; but when it
terminates, and in whatever manner it may termi
nate, the momentary pause which may ensue,
will only be a breathing-time, before the com
mencement of a conflict between the Romish
despotism, and every thing sacred and civil which
is true and precious.
One should think that at such an ominous crisis,
minor difibrences might be so far overlooked as to
unite in a cordial sympathy and co-eperation all
evangelical communions holding to the fundamen
tal verities of gospel truth. But in point of fact
this is far from being the case. The integrity even of
our owp communion, has been seriously threatened,
although we rejoice to believe from recent indica
tions, that the tempestuous aspect of the times is
beginning to be irradiated by the hues of the rain
bow-signal of peace. In any event, the next
twelve months must be a very exciting period in the
history of the M. E. Church. No intelligent mem
ber or friend of. the Church, can be willing to forego
the pleasure of reading the record of her triumphs,
or to withhold the trifle which it will cost him in
bearing his part of the burden of sustaining her
publications, especially in the dark and trying day.
The Publishing Committee are under the disa
greable necessity of striking from the mail books,
the names of several hundred non-paying subscri
bers. It will take a week or two to do this ; and
meanwhile we beg earnestly that every one who
wishes to continue the paper, and is in arrears for
more than two years, would save us the trouble of era
sing his name, by prompt payment. We regret to say
that of some three hundred former subscribers
whose names were erased at the close of the last
volume, not twenty have paid a dollar of their ar
rearages,—a fact that speaks badly for the morals
of the country.
THE WESLEYAN MISSIONARY ANNIVER
SARY.
Through the magic power of “ movable types,”
and that mighty lever, the modern press, we are
able to transport our readers to Exeter Hall, and
set them down to a rich intellectual and spiritual
repast From this visit, we hope for something bet
ter than mere gratification, or even admiration,
though we are sure that both of these emotions will
be raised upon the perusal of the soul-stirring ad
dresses delivered on the occasion. We should like
every reader to feel that the cause is not British in its
character, nor exclusivesly Wesleyan. The same
obligations which press upon the consciences of our
friends across the sea, the same motives, the same
interests, address us. To be sure, we do not affect
to feel indifference to the fact that a missionary or
ganization on so magnificent a scale, has been pro
jected, and the missionary spirit in so large a mea
sure, has been felt in its heavenly baptism by the
successors of our own Wesley. Nor do we pretend
to shut our eyes to the consideration that at the me
tropolitan centre of an empire that numbers as its
subjects, one-sixth of the human race, upon whose
flag the sun never sets, whose commerce girdles
the globe, a movement as energetic as that now in
progress for the diffusion of Christianity in its pu
rest and most efficient form, has been set on foot
On the contrary, we feel the liveliest satisfaction in
all this. But then, there is a somewhat unwelcome
contrast which forces itself upon the mind of an
American Methodist, when one looks at our supe
rior numbers and wealth, and at the vast inferiority
of our efforts and contributions to the cause of
Christian missions. »
u. We talk of the hardness of the times; but what
are our burdens ctiujpa.red_withjhose of our Wes
leyan brethren 1 What is our taxation
of their’s! After making due allowance for their
greater facilities for combined action, and their bet
ter organization, there will still be a vast balance to
be set down to the credit of their superior zeal, en
ergy and activity. How much do we need a season
of heavenly visitation ! How greatly desirable is
it, that the public opinion of the Church on this
side the sea, should be brought up to a higher
standard both of principle and feeling; that the
hundreds’of thousands who are yearly swelling our
ranks, should be drilled from the beginning of their
religioflfe life, into tho persuasion that they are, ev
ery man of them, solemnly bound to do the utmost
they can, with the means God has put at their dis
posal, to send the “heroic remedies of the Gospel
pharmacopia” into the whole earth. Our mission
ary secretaries, if, in this country, they cannot op
ejate as extensively by viva voce addresses, as the
secretaries of British Societies are in circumstances
to do, should at least bring their influence to bear
upon the mind and heart of the Church more fully,
through the press. The conductors of the news
papers and other periodicals of the Church, should
keep a more wakeful eye upon this field of opera
tions ; and by all possible arguments, modes of il
lustration, facts, exhortations, let it be felt that they
consider the subject one of the highest importance.
The ministry at large, who can do so much to sus
tain and enlarge the circulation of our periodicals,
should take high ground here; and in the spirit of
an jexpansive charity, which thinks nothing done
while any thing remains to be done, tread under
foot the interminable and acrimonious janglings,—
the reptile brood of narrow-souled bigotry, with
which they are assailed; and answer the calumnies
of the cavillers who are stickling upon a phraze
and worshipping a form, by giving themselves to re
doubled exertions for the spread of Christian holi
ness over these and all lands. Let our wealthy
members, and we know several who have large
means and are not burdened with family cares, set
a praiseworthy example of liberality; and our poor
widows, we will answer for it, will not withhold their
mites. Ihen may we confidently hope to see a move,
ment in this country worthy to be set side by side
with that of our elder brethren i n England. May the
good providence of God hasten the time.

CONVENTION OP THE FRIENDS OP EM
ORY COLLEGE.
The address of Bishop Andrew, President of the
Board of Trustees of Emory College, to the friends
of that Institution, and of religious education un
der the supervision of the M. E. Church in Georgia,
calling a convention at the time of the approaching
commencement, will be found in another column.
This appeal will, we trust, meet with a hearty and
general response. It will never do for the Church
to relinquish the vantage-grouud she now occupies.
Too much treasure and toil have been already ex
pended upon .the precious interests of education to
allow for a moment the coward thought of giving up
the ship. Events, if not arguments, should have
taught us wisdom ere this. As an ecclesiastical
body it will be impossible for us to retain our hold
upon the rising generation, especially those of them
favoured with worldly advantages, and destined to
occupy positions of influence in society, unless there
is provision made for a complete and thorough scho
lastic course in colleges under our own influence,
served by faculties of instruction in whose religious
views and principles the Methodist public can have
entire confidence. We commend to our public
spirited Georgia friends, the exarnple of a .few of
the friends of the Wesleyan University, who late
ly held a meeting in New York and pledged them
selves for half of the endowment of a professorship
of $20,000, provided the New York Conference
would raise and secure the other half, which no
doubt will be promptly done. This amount is to be
securely vested in the United States, in state or city,
stock, or loaned on bond and mortgage under the
direction of a board of Trustees, to be appointed
by the subscribers and approvod by the annual
Conference. Could not something of this sort be
done at the approaching Oxford commencement I
THE BRITISH AND FOREIGN BIBLE SO
CIETY.
Thfl following noble sentiments are found in a
speech delivered by Viscount Morpeth, at the re
cent annual meeting of the British and Foreign
Bible Society, held at Exeter Hall, Lord Bexley,
the President, of the Society, in the chair. We
regret we have not room for the whole speech.
Viscount Morpeth, on coming forward to second
the resolution, was most heartily cheered. His
Lordship spoke as follows:—So cordial and unre
served is the interest I have taken, and continue to
take, in the magnitude of its operations, and the ex
tension of its influence,—that, though I should fail,
perhaps, in making any good plea for bearing my
part in the proceedings of this day, especially in
the presence of so many of those who have so long
been engaged in divers ways and places in the va
rious departments of this Society,—in its govern
ing counsels, or its active agencies,—in its old cir
cuits, or the vast range of its foreign enterprises,
or its real and efficient labours in the bible vine
yard ; yet I ever feel that I can scarcely refuse,
when called upon on these occasions, to drop a short
word of sympathy with their objects, and encour
agement of their exertions. [Cheers.] The in
teresting report which we have to-day heard con
tains many very gratifying statements respecting
both our new and our old adherents to the great
cause which we have so much at heart, from the
monarch who so worthily and righteously fills the
throne of Prussia, to the young Brahmin who calls
Christ “the Lord,” and the bible “holy.” It is
most true that I cannot myself pretend to the high
distinction of having been in any degree their as
sistant and fellow-labourer; but I feel that I may
somewhat vary the routine of the matters with re
spect to which I have ventured to speak upon for
mer occasions. I may state that, since I last had
the pleasure of attending these anniversaries, it has
been my lot to have visited the head quarters of the
American Bible Society, in the City of New York.
[Hear.] I had there the great gratification of meet
ing many of itd' most distinguished members, and
was greeted by them in a most cordial and kindly
spirit; and as they showed me over their large and
well-filled depot, I hardly believed that I was not in
your own depository at Blackfliars [he*ar,] and, in
deed, I half expected to fall in with your respected
secretary, Mr. Brandram. [Laughter.] But, when
I rivetted my attention on the locality, and on the
things which then surrounded me, I must say that
I felt that the international brotherhood, connected
elsewhere by so many strong links of a common
origin, language, and law, seemed to me on that spot
to become indissolubly close. [Cheers.] I felt
that two great kindred races were embarked togeth
er in one common and catholic cause, and that both
spare something of their national energies,—some
thinj^from the wealth of their miehtv arensioo,
for the paramour purposed spreading Christian light
ana Truffi'“over the dark corners of eur globe.
[Hear, hear.] And, though special missions may
be productive of advantages, new treaties lead to
an improved understanding, and fresh boundaries
increase the probabilities of peace,—I could not
but hail in the Bible Society a surer guarantee of
mutual co-operation, and a safer basis of reciprocal
| esteem, than in all that trade could purchase or
diplomacy persuade. [Cheers.] And it is not to
foreign concord alone that I would look, when au
guring well'of the effect of the Bible Society, be
cause I cannot but think that it seems equally cal
j culated to exercise a beneficial influence on our do
mestic concord. Indeed, one of the many claims
which I ever feel it has upon my allegiance,—one
of the many powerful arguments it puts forth to
gain my attachment and wm my support,—I find in
its admirable adaptation to supply that which seems
to be not the only, but the foremost,—not the ex
elusive, but, perhaps, the most trying,—object of
our times, religious co-operation, religious charity,
religiouiyjeace. [Cheers.] In saying this, I trust
I shall rot be suspected of any indifference to the
claims of essential truth,—of life-giving doctrines.
[Hear.] There may have been times,—there may
have been places, where lukewarmness or latitudi
narianism with respect to these have been the evils
to be most sedulously watched and guarded against;
but I must say that, in my view at least, it does seem
| that the prevailing tendency and risk of our own
day lies in our fencing ourselves in too rigidly and
exclusively, instead of too loosely and remissly, be
hind the entrenchments of our own notions and
opinions. [Hear.] Truth may have a thousand
times called for martyrdom,—it cannot once call
for intolerance. [Hear.] She may be summoned
to pass through the furnace; but woe, woe to her if
she kindle it! [Hear, hear.]
Methodist Chuhch Property. — A great clam
our is raised by several of our exchange papers about
the right, or ownership, of Church property in the
Methodist Episcopal Church. All agree that the
whole belongs to the ministers ; and that the peo
ple, the poor, dear people, have no part or lot in the
matter. The Banner of the Cross, and the Metho
dist Protestant, seem to be particularly interested
in this matter. The latter affirms, in substance,
that he has no desire to misunderstand, and no pur.
pose to misrepresent the matter of ownership of
property in the M. E. Church. And yet he says it
all belongs to the ministers. How was it then, that
in the secession of 1829 his party, in several places
took possession of the Church edifices, in despite of
th^ ministers who were present and opposing, and
to whom he says they belonged ? Does he mean to
contradict himself; or to tell the public that he and
his brethren violently took, and yet unjustly retain
possession of property that did not, and does not now
belong to them? If,-eg he affirms,the property is
all secured to the ministers of the M. E. Church,
how is it that it is now out of their possession, and
their pulpits occupied by his own ministers? In
common honesty these misrepresentations ought to
be stopped, or the property in question restored to
those who, by the very terms of the allegation, are
its rightful owners.
But is the allegation true ? No; by no means.
All our Church property is deeded to a board of
Trustees who hold it in trust, for the use of the
members and ministers of the Methodist Episcopal
Church. How else shall it b^eeded? Do Me
thodist Protestants, or Protemnt Episcopalians
deed their property to other than trustees of their
respective Churches, or for the use of others than
their own members and ministers? No. Why then
do they try to make the public believe that Method- ■
ist Episcopalians are wicked and tyrannical for act
ing upon the very same principles of justice and
safety that govern themselves upon precisely the
same subject ? Why t^pse statements,—-these traps
to catch gulls? Is Ephraim envious of Judah, and
anxious to vex him?—Richmond Advocate.

RECENT PUBLICATIONS. *

We had the pleasure to notice particularly, last
week, these volumes. We take occasion to add,
that the style in which the publication is gotten up,

belongs to the cheap edition, three'volumes neatly
half bound, of390 to 500 pages each, costing but one
dollar in all. Throughout the Protestant world
there is but one opinion as to the value of this
book. An enormous demand for it has produced
various editions, and it has been read with pleasure
and profit by hundreds of thousands. The appro
priateness of such a work to the times on which we
have fallen, is too obvious to need remark. We

A Sketch of the Life of the Rev. Elijah Steele,
by B. M. Drake of the Mississippi Conference;
to which is added a funeral discourse, by the Rev.
W. Winans,D. D. Cincinnati Book Concern, 1843.
Concerning the subject of this biographical
sketch, the writer sayS, in commencing the memoir:
“it is admitted that the life of Elijah Steele is bar
ren of incident, and that the impression he made
upon the world was local,—the sphere of his la
bour being confined to a few circuits and stations.
Nor can his history be connected with that of the
church the world, or even the literature of the age.
His path in any of these was too small to identify
him with them. In tracing his history, we may
not expect to follow the course of some lordly
river, which receives tribute from every clime, and
pours its riches into the lap of the mighty ocean;
but we should rather look for the cool clear stream
gushing from the rock, and making the tiny valley
smile with verdure; and not tne less refreshing to
the weary traveller because unmixed with the pol
luted streams of earth.” The whole memoir is
written in the beautiful spirit of such a concep
tion, and cannot fail to do good, especially in Miss
issippi, where Mr. Steele was personally known.
Of this remarkable young minister, Dr. Winans
said, in preaching his funeral sermon:—“I have
known many brilliant young men; hut nf all I over
knew, no matter what their early advantages might
have been, I never knew but one (Summerfield)
who would compare with Elijah Steele, in richness
of thought, extensiveness of range, clearness of
presentation, dignity of manner, and effectiveness.”

TO THE FRIENDS OF EMORY COLLEGE.
This Institution, which was established to pro
mote the glory of God, and the welfare of society
by the promotion of sanctified learning, has been
in operation now several years. From the first till
now, its number of students has gradually increas
ed, and during the past year good order has prevail
ed almost without the least exception. Within a
month or two it will graduate its third class, and it
is believed, that it has, at least to some extent, met
the anticipations of those of its friends, who were
reasonable in their expectations: and that it has
not effected a great deal more, is owing to causes
which those who manage its affairs cannot control.
The Institution was established because a large
portion of our friends and brethren felt the need of
it. The Conference only responded to the known
wishes of a large portion of the membership. It
is known that the College went into operation on
the manual labor plan; we knew that this was a
favorite scheme with the people generally, as well
as with the conference and trustees, and we resolv
ed to make the experiment fully and fairly, and a
costly one it has proved. It is now probable that if
we had established an institution on the old plan,
j we should now have been out of debt, and in a
-1—-:-i
prosperous caidition; but we pirsued our working
experiment a| the costof thousands, and abandoned
it only when 41m stared us in the face, and yet (who
wogld belie veiit?) there are men who, up to that
time, had nevwpaid a dollar, who now utterly re-’

METHODIST ITINERACY. >
Brother Wightman,—It will, no doubt, appear
strange to many of my South-Carolifca and <^w
gia friends, to find me in this distant city,—and,
especially under a regular transfer. Well,—as it
was in part an act for example’s sake, allow me room
enough in your valuable paper to say, that in the
palmy days of my itinerancy,—when, with limbs
tireless as the bounding deer,—and heart warm a*
early Methodism was,—I went forth from the soeaA >
and associations of jpy boyish days, to open mi
ministry in a circuit lying upon Fee Dee rivet am
Lynchs’ Creek, and extending from Georget
to Bear Creek, at brother Mangum’s. This cfl
in 1805, and the Columbia station with its «ou.
appointments in 1808, were all the fields of lah
in South-Carolina that I ever had the pie
fill My labours beside, until last year i
have been confined to Georgia. For many L
my family has been stationary; and occasion^
could hear a good natured, and sometimes a
more suspicious remark, like this,—local trav4
preacher. All allusions of this kind were 11
rasp upon my feelings. But I never minded it lJ
where I was well known,—for I knew very
that whatever else I had not accomplished,_L
this, that wherever I was sent, none would be
tressed by the fear, that I would "neglect my if
ranihome, for the sake of my local home, much!
jovea it.. Ana it any brother should ever^E^

self in having a little farm, around which he wants
to describe a circle, I hope he will follow my ex*
ample all through,—and when he gets an appoint^
menta long way from his family, and thinks it best, ’
to keep them at home,—bear the evil himself._
Don’t let him charge the Church a fourth, or at,
third of his time to consume with his family_■
Methodism, as an itinerant system of ministerial
service, knows us only as itinerant men, and can.
not, without some surrender of principle, ’ us *
in any other character. Therefore, if a travelling
preacher finds it best to continue his family in one
place,he should make it up in his mind to bear it as
an evil which he prefers, to that of leaving the itin
erant work ; and he should be emphatically a trav
elling preacher. Many years of observation has '
fully satisfied my mind, thatrthe more we innqvate
upon our original plan, and embarrass the superin.
tendents with local necessities, the worse it will be
for us. If an itinerant ministry is available tq the
Church, more than any other form of preachicg, it
must be so, only in proportion as we are ready to do
that work, which may be judged best for the gene
ral good. I have seen for years, that it would be
best, if the old practice of transferring preachers
from one conference to another, could be more com
mon, than of late years it has been. I am now here
by the eflfect of this opinion. And, although far
from my local home,—it is not by the exercise of
Episcopal power,—without my hearty consent
Brethren, allow me to say,—in view of Method

this issue,—that rather than have the true princi

ing to it,—is my motto. Respectfully yours,
