licly known as a drinker, just in proportion
to his indulgence?and that drink, or
^ not drink, a certain publicity would be
the inevitable consequence. I therefore
took the Pledge, and publicly came out ?
teetotaler, of the two consequences choosing
the lesser evil, preferring by nil odds,
the publicity of not drinking at rII, to the
publicity of being in danger of drinking
too much for the future, however moderate
my drinking had been for the past.'
This seemed to us a somewhat new,
and very forcibly presented argument in
favor of signing the Pledge; and we respectfully
commend it to the careful attention
of ail those, who are still 4 halting between
two opinions, upon the sublet.

FROM WASHINGTON.

Washington, Dee. 28.
We learn from New York that the grand Dc- j
mocratic Committee, just elected, for the city of ,
New York, is so comjtoscd us to give a preponder- I
ancc to the Calhoun men. This is the more pro- j
bablc for the reason that most of the young men of j
tiled cmocr .tic party in New York are friendly to
the election of Mr. Calhoun.

in favor of r. Calhoun. M r. Gushing in a speech J
of yesterday, which aroused much party feeling, J
on all sides, alluded very strongly to the dissen- j
tions in the democratic ranks, and thereupon warn- |
cd them that the administration could exercise a
decided influence in the ultimate choice, if they
chose.
By the way, !\fr. Cushing's speech on the Bank- (
rupt Repealing Act has opened a grand political J
debate?which may last till many of its participants
are politically bankrupt?i. e. till their Icim of
service shall expire.
Mr. Gushing certainly aroused the attention of
both sides of the House in a remarkable degree.? j
The Globe considers his doctrines as profligate,
| bocause he offers the co-operation of the Executive
! with any party that will co-operatc with it. The
j Globe, however, it must be remembered, has
j steadily repelled all the efforts of the Tyler men
I to creep into the democratic ranks, and for the
I plain reason that there would not be offices enough
! for all.
The bankrupt debate is the great political debate
of the session. Mr. Arnold began it. Mr. Cush'
ing has spoken boldly, and With more truth than
poetry, on the side of the administration. Mr.
Thompson, of Indiana, on the whig side, spoke
l very ably to-day?showing the inconsistencies of
Mr. Cushing, Mr. Webster, Mr. Tyler, Ac. Mr.
Kennedy^of Indiana, a thorough loco-foco, spoke
most earnestly on the other side, and vindicated
democracy and Tylcrism. Mr. Wise has the ffoor
for to-morrow, and will, I doubt not, exert himself
very much.
The Senate is not engaged in any business of
public ini|?ortance.
Washington, Dec. 2ff.
The debate in the House on the position of the
Tyler Administration ; the causes of the failure of
Whig measures, and of the defeat of the Whig
party at the late elections; the prospects of the
Democratic party; the next Preffdenti-d election,
Ac., is still going on, and is not likely to abate in
interest. Mr. Cushing's speech is regarded us a
Cabinet manifesto- Mr. Horace Everrctt declared
thit it was prefaced by advice and uttered by
authority. The speech, or procl imatiou?whatever
it njay be called, has proved a failure, so far
as it was intended to intimidate or coax cither the
Whigs or the Democrats into the support of tiie
Administration of John Tyler and the passage of
the Exchequer Bill. The Whigs, through Mr.
Thompson, of Indiana, declared they would neither
be bribed nor brow-bcatcn info it, and his colleague,
.Mr. Kennedy, says the Democrats will not bid a
'copper for John Tyler, even now that he is put
up with all his patronage for sale to any party.?
Mr. Kennedy, however, in the course of his speech
did Mr. Gushing the justice to treat his proposition
as it was intended; and as so much censure
has been cast on Mr. Gushing for off-Ting to tamper
with the immaculate virtue of Congress.?Mr.
Kennedy,ft remarks arc worth repeating.
* Mr. Kennedy.said, lie would tell (lie
gcn'Lmian front Massachusetts, (Mr.
Cashing) that on behalf of hrs parly he
could give no hid. But hescarcelv thought
^ ?
the gentleman in earnest. fie had not
understood him as bringing in Mr. Tyler
to be bid for here, though lie must confess
; his speech had a most powerful leaning
! that way. [Roars of merriment.] * lie
J had understood the gentleman simply t?>
mean that Mr. Tyler was Pjcsident ol
the United States; that those who had
|)iit hiin into office now turned out to be a
faction, and were wilting to break up and
destroy the Government for.the sake of
wreaking their vengennge upmi'?4iim. (a? o
there was too mucu troth in that:) an<i
! that Mr. Tyler, be ng in charge of the
J Government, must carry it on with the
best means he had. If that was what that
gentleman meant, and he meant, Mr. K.
corresponded with him in opinion. As
long as Mr. Tyler was President, he was
President; the Government was not to
he stopped, ft was net very material to
the people who was President, but ii was
material that the Government should go
on." And ii" lie found that a certain set
of men were hanging on irs wheels and
[clogging them so that thev cvu!d not
vT O O # r
! move, it was his duty to demand support
I wherever there was honesty enough to
give it. If this was all tho gentleman
meant, Mr. -K. applauded the sentiment;
and hoped the great Democratic party
would take especial care to act as their
' avowed principles should demand."
Mr. Wise had the floor to day, and
I public curiosity was much excited in regard
to his defence of his position. Bat
Mr. Wise was so much cramped by the
j one hour rule, that ho made little imp resj
sion. Me undertook to show that the Whig
dissensions commenced prior to the inau|
gurntion of Harrison, and that the par|
ty would have fallen to pieces, even if
Harrison' had not been taken away.
At the conclusion of his hour, Mr. Wise
cast an anxious look to the clock, and
stated 'that he had just come to the most
important point in his remarks. He would
undertake to prove the truth of the allegation
that the Whig members of Congress
.. O ' .
1 did oder to postpone the second lianiv dim,
: if .Mr. Tyler would retain his cuhiuet.
i Mr. Wise appealed to the House for
leave to proceed, but the Whigs refused
leave, by yeas and nays. Mr. Wise,
therefore, gained his object completely,
in leaving the impression that he could
prove this allegation against the Whigs,
| though Mr. Uotts had pronounced it false
anil slanderous.
Mr. Ecssonden defended the coursg of 1
the whig*, and took Mr. Cashing severe- i
o o
ly to task for threatening Executive wrath i
against the whigs in Congress for not vo
ting according to Executive dictation.?
He called on the whigs to repel this as.
sault on public liberty, the privileges of
Congress, &c. Mr. Cushing insisted that
he was misrepresented.
Mr- Marshall, of Ky., has the floor for
to.morrow. He will have enough to do :
