oo
MR. CALHOUN, OF S. CAROLINA,
ON THE
Bill to prevent the interference of certain
Federal Ojictrs in elections.
[COItLLUDE.D]
' The next movement he made was the
. boldest of thu whole series. The union
a of the Government with the paper syatem
was not yet complete. A central control
was wanting, in order to give to it unity
- of action, and a full developemet of its
power and influence. This he sought in
a national bank, with a capital of* 10.000,
000, to be composed principally of the
stock held by the public rreditiors; thus
binding more strongly to the Government
that already powerflul cla.s, by giving
thetm, through its agency, increasc(l profit
and a decided control over the currency,
e exchanges, and the business transactions
of the country. On the question of char
0 tering the bank, the great battle was
fought betwseen the two schools. The
t. contest was long and obstinate, but victo
I- ry ultintately declared in favor of the na
tional Federal school.
The leader of that school was not con
tent with these great achievements. His
bold and ardent mind was not of a tem
e per to stop short of the end at which he
r aimed. His next movement was to seize
i. on the money power, and he put forth
able reports. in which he asserted the
broad principle, that Congress was under
no constitutional testriction in the use of
- the public money, but the general welfare,
' and that it toight he appropriated to any
purpose whatever, believed to be calcu
d lated to promote the general interest, and
.. as freely to the objects not enumerated, as
t- those that were specified in the constitn
i- tion. To this he added another, and per
haps more dangerous assumpltion of pow.
er, that the taxing power, which was
granted expressly to raise revenue. tmight
be used as a protective power for the en
couragement of manufactures, or any oth
d er branch of industry which Congress
might choose to foster; and thus it was in
fact perverted from a revenue to a penal
B power, through which the entire capital
and industry of the Union might be con
trolled: Congress was not prepared at
that early stage to follow so bold a lead,
but the seed was sown by a skilful hand,
to sprout When the proper season arrived.
t, When he retired from office, no cot
trolling mind was left to perfect the sys
tet which he had commenced with such
d consummate skill and success; and short
ly after, under the administration of' the
elder Adams, the alien and sedition acts,
and the quasi war with ''rance, as it was
r- called, followed the violent and precipi
tate measures of less sagacious antd pow
erful minds, and which in their re-action
" expelled their authors from power, and
d raised Jefferson to the Presidency.
He came in as a reformer: but, with
the most ardent desire and the highest ca
pacity to effect a reformation, lie could do
little to change the direction which his ri
val had impressed at the outs'i on the po
litical machine. Economty. indeed, was
r introduced, anti the expenditures reduced,
but the ligatures which united the Gov
ernment with the paper system were too
strong to be bursted. The fAded debt,
e though greatly reduced by him, could not
be extingiuished. The charter of the Uni
ted States Batik haif still half its terti to
ruo, and the use of banks and bank notes
in the fiscal transactions of the Govern
ment had taken too strong a hold to be
superseded at once. In the tmean time.
~. the agitation caused by the gigantic con
r- fhtet between France atnd England reach
o edl our distant and peaceful shores, and
B, the Admioistrationt wvas almost exclusive
rly occupied in efforts toprvtages
sions on our nights, anti preserve our netn
Strality. To etJect'that, every expedient
was attempted; negotiatiton, emb a rgo,
e non-importation, and non-intercourse, but
itn vain. War followed, and with it all
hopes of carrying out thte reformn contem
plated by Jefferson when he came into
- powver failed.
WVhen the peace arrived, the country
was deeply in debt. Capital and indus
try had taken new directions in conse
.quence of the long interruption of our for
eign commerce, and the public attention
completely diverted from the qtuestions
.which had brought into conflict the t wo
:great political schools, and whicn hadl so
long divided the country.
v The season had now arrived when the
d seed which had been so skilfully sown by
Hamilton, as *has been stated, began to
0 germinate, atnd soon shot forth with the
e most vigorous gtowth. Dtuties came to
t be imposed without regard to revenue, and
money appropriated without reference to
j the granted powers. Tariff followed ta
m iff in rapitd succession, carrying ini their
It train a profusion of expenditures on bar
hors, roads, canals, pensIons, and a host
ofothetrs, comprehending objects ofalmost
every description. In such rapid succes
Ssiotn did the protective duties follow, that
j. in 1828--in the short space of twelve
.years atler the termination of the late war,
t they reached the, enormous atmounit of
nearly one-half of the aggregate value of
. the etntire imports, after deducting the re
shipments. Beyond this point, the sys
tern never advanced, and fortunately for
the country it did not. H ad it continued
its progress a few years longer, the enor
mous patronage which it placed at the dis
posal of the Chief Magistrate would have
terminated our form of Government by
enabling him toominate his successor. wr
by plunging the country into a revolution,
to be followed by disunion or despotism,
as was foretold would be the the conse
quence in the report to the Virginia Le
gislature, so often referred to, if the sys
tem it reprotiaced were carried out in
practice. But happily, with the tarilfof
182$, the reaction commenced, and has
been ever since progre'sing. How, nr
by whom it was commenced, aind has
been urged forward to the present point,
this is got the proper oceasion to state.
All I propose now is to trace its progress,
and mark the point at whirh it has arri
ved.
The first step or this retrogade move
ment was the overthrow of the adminis
tration 01 the younger Adams. He came
into power on the extreme principles and
doctrities of the Federal national school,
and on them he placed the hope of ma in
taining his elevation. For the truth of
this assetrtiou, I appeal to his inaugural ad
dress, and his messages to the two Houses
at the openings of the annual sessions;
and to expel his administration from pow
er was, of course, a prelitninary and indis
pensable step towards the restorntion of
the principles and doctrines of the oppo
site school; and fortunately this was efree
ted by a decided majority at the expifa
tion of his first term.
The next step was the final] discharge
of the funded debt; and for this imporant
step, at so early a period, the country is
indebled principally to a friend, now un
fortunately no more-the amiable, the
talented,. the patriotic Lowndes-the au
thor of that simple, but effective measure,
the sinking fund act, passed snortly after
the termmiation of the late war.
But the most formidable of all the ob
stacles-the source of the vast and cor
rupting surplus, witi its host of extrava
gant- and unconstitutional expenditures,
the protective tariff, still remained il
fbrce, and obsiructed any farther progreis
in the re-action that had commenced
By what decided and hold measures it was
overeome is well known to all, and need
not b tolid on this occasin. Jt is sufli
cient to say, that after a long and desper
ate struggle, the controversy terminated
in the- compromise act, which alandonen
the protective principle, and has. I trust,
closed forever, whaa has proved in this
Government a most prolifi source of pow
er, patronage, and corruption.
The next step in the progress, was the
overthrow of the Bank of 'the United
States-the centre and soul of the credit
system-a step that may justly he regard
ed as not inferior to ain other in the
whole series. That was fbllowed by the
deposite act of '36, which transferred to
the treasuries of the States the vast sur
plus which continued to flow in upon t1s,
notwithstanding the great retlu-tion under
the compromise act. This decisive mens
ure dishurt iened our sureharged Treasu
ry, and has forced onn this Government the
necessity of retrenehment and econoemy,
and thereby has greatly stretgthenaed and
accelerated the re-action. So necessary
i4 the reduction of the income to reform
that I am diposeil to re-ard it. as a polit.
ical maxim in free States, that an im.
poverished Treasury. once in a generatiou
at least, is almost indispensable to the
preservation of their institutions and lib
erty.
The next stage in the progress was the
suspension of specie payieuts. This oc
casion afforded an opportunity to strike
the first blow against that illegitimate and
utholy alliance. It was given decidedly,
holdly, and vigorously, but still with only
partial success. The interest in favor of
maintaining the connexion was too pow
es ful to be overcome at once; but though
not broken, the tie is greatly weakened,
and nothing now is wanting to sever forev
er ibis fatal knot, but to follow up what
has already beeu done by persevering and
energetic blow~s,
This is ahe point to whaich the re-action
has already reached; and ifhe question
tnow to be considered is, to whatt ptoit
ought iito be urged, andl what are the in
tea mediate obstacles to be overe eme? I
am, for myself, prep~aredl to answer. I
have no concealument. My aim is fixed.
Ii is no less thani to turnl bacek the Govern
moent to. where it was when ii cotmmenced
itsoperation in 1789; to obliterate all the
intermediate measures originating in the
peculiar principles atnd policy of the- school
to which I ant opposed, and which expe
rience has proved 1o be so dangerous and
uncongenial to our system; to take a
fresh start, a new departure, on the State
Rights repulican track, as was intended
by the framers of the constitution. That
is the poit at which I have aimed for
tmore than twelve years, and towardsi.
which I have persiste-d, during the whole
period, to urge my way, in defiance of
opposing difficulties, dangers, and dis
cou ragemenuts, and from which nothing
shall drive me (while in public life) till the
objeci at which I aitm Necomnplished.
By far the most fortmidable difficulties are
already surmotunted. Those that remairn
are co'mparatively insignificant.
Among these, the most important and
diflieult liv far is, to separate the govern
ment from the banks, but which. after the
t~lowsi the@ connexion har received, will re
quire not much more than utnyieliding
firmness anti perseverance. This (lone,
the great work of freeing the Government
enmirely fronm the paper systemc on wvhich
Hamilton laid the foundation of his whole
system. will have been achieved.
The next is, to carry out. in the revision
of the tarifif, which must take prace at the
qit or succeeding session, the provisions
of the compromise act,. that there shall be
n~o dnty laid ifntswhatnmasb heneel
sary to the economical and constitutional
wants of the Government. Should this
be accomplished, there will be an end to
the protective system, with all the evil
that followed and must ever follow in its
train. Nor can I believe, after what we
have expertenced, aid what has been said
luring this session, that there will lie any
insuperable difficult) in ellerting an object
so intimately conneeted wiih the peace
and tranquillity of the Union.
Having freed the Government froi the
paper and protective systems, the next
step in importance is, to put a final stop
to internal improvements, the construe
tion and improvement of hurbors. and the
extravagant wateon what we are pleas
ed to call the pension system. but which
has departed from every principle jugly
belonging to -sch a syslem. No Govern
ment was ever before burdened with an
expenditure so absurd and inoistrous.
It confounds all distinctions between the
deserving and undeserving, and yearly
draws millions from the Treasury withoot
any just claim on the public bounty. and
ought to be both arrested and reformied.
A single step more brings the Govern
ment to the destined point; I mean a tho
rough reformation in the administrative
department of the Government. I doubt
not but that every branch needs reform.
There are, doubtless, numerous defalca.
tions in addition to those brought to light.
The fault has been more in that system
(a brief narrative of which I have given)
than those who have been charged with
the administration of the Government.
For yeats money Was ns dlirt. The
Treasury was oppressed with it, and the
only solicitude vas how to get clear of
what wal considered a useless burden.
leuce the vast increase of expenditures;
hence the loose and inattentive adminis
tration of our fiscal concerns; hence the
heavy defaleations. Nor are these re
marks confined to the executive depart
ment of the Government; they apply to
all, to the two Houses of Congress as
well as to other branches. But there is
no longer a surplus. The Treasury is ex
hausted, and the work of retrenchment,
economy, and accountability is forced otn
us. Reform in the fiscal action of the
Government can no longer he delayed.
and I rejoice that such is the fact. Econ
otny and accounathility are virtues belong
ing to free and popular governmen ts, and
without which they cannot long endure.,
The assertion is pre-eminently true when
applied to this Government; and hence
the prominent place they occupy in the
c'reed of the State Rights and Republican
school.
Having taken these steps, every meas
ttre of promineuce originating in the prin
ciples or policy of the national Federal
school will become obliterated, itmd the
Government will have been brought back.
after the lapse of fifty years, to tl'e point
of original depatture, when it may lie put
on its new track. To guard against a
false steerage thereafter, one imnort.,ni
measure, inuaddition to those enumerared,
vi'l be indispensable. to place the new
States, as far as the public domain s con
cerned, in a condition as independent -f
the Government as the old. It is as much
due to them, as it is indispensable to ar.
complish the great object in view. The
public domain, within these States, is too
great a stake to he left under the cotrrol of
this Government. It is dificult to esti
mate the vast addition it makes to its
power and patronage, and the controlling
and corrupting infinence which it ma
exercise over the Presidential election,
and through that, the strong impulse it
may receive in a wrong direction. Till it
is removed, there can be no assurance of a
successful and safe steerage, eveni if ever~v
I therc siniister iniltuence should be remto
ved.
It would be presmtnpuouis in me, Mr.
President, to adlvise those who are char
ged with the administr-ation of the Gov.
ernent, what course to audopt; hut, if
they wotild bear the voice of one wvho de
sires nothmng for himself and wvhose ottly
wish is to see the counrrv protsperous, free,
and happy, I would say to them, you are
pla-edl in the most remarkable juncture
that has ever ocourredsince the establiah
mnent of the Federal Govertnment. By
seizing it. you tmay bring the vessel of
State to a position, where she may take
a new tack, and thereby escape all the
sho:,ls and bre-sker-s, a-uong which a false
steerage bhas run her, anti bring her 'tri
timphantly into her destined port, with
honor to yourselves, atnd safety to those
on board. Tamke then yotur grourmd holdlly;
avow your object; disclose your measuire3;
and let the people see clearly that you in
tenal-what Jetferson designed to do, but.
from adverse circumstances, could not ae
coimplish-to reverse the measures origin
atng in pruieos and policy uinconigenial
to our political system-tmo divest thie Go
vernment of all undue patrotiage aund in
fluence-.-ro i'estrict it to the few great oh~
jects intended by the Constitution-in a
word, to give a complete ascendancy t
the good olal Virginia school over iti an'
tagonist, which time and experitence have
proved to) be foreign to our system of Ga.
vernmuent-and .vou may Count -with eon
fidence on their support, .withomn toking
to any other means of success. Should
they take such a course at this propitious
tmotnent, our free and happy institutions
may be perpetuated for generations; but,
if a diflerent, short will be their duration.
On thin question of patronage, let mei
add, in conclusion, that according to my
conception, the great ana- leading error
in Hamilton and his school originated in a
mistake as to the analogy between ours
and tho .Rerias system bf 2o......-.....
If we were to judge by their outward
forn, there is, indeed, a striking analogy.
between them in many particulars; but if
we look within, at their spirit and genius,
never were two free Governments so per
fectly dissimilar. They are, in fact, the
very opposites. Of all free governments
that ever. exi-ted-no, I will enlarge tha
propoition-of all governments that ever
existed. free or despotic, the British Gov
ernment can bear the largest amount of
patronige-ihe greatest exaction and
pressure on the peoplp. without changing
its character, or running into revolution.
The greater, in fact, its patronage, the
stronger it is, till the pressure begins to
crush the mass of population with its su -
perincumberit ieight. But directly the
opposite is the case' with ours. Of all
government< that ever existed, it can stand
under the least patronage, in proportion
to the population and wealth of thle cotai
try, without chaiging its character, or
hazarding a revolution. I have not-made
these assertions liglhtly. They are the
result of mnuch reflection, and can be sus
tained by conclusive re.asous drawn from
the nature of the two Governments;'but
this is not the proper occasion to discuss
the subject.

THE OREGON TEARITORY.
It is a naiter of no little surprise, thac
public attention has not been more strong
ly attracted towards that vast and magm
ficent territory, stretching from the Rocky -
Mountains to the Paci6c Ocean, and-from
the 424 to the 49th parallel of North lati
tule, blessed with all the ailvantages of a
salubrious climate and a fertile soil, waters
ed by large navigable rivers with unequal
led facilities fur the fur trade and fisheries,
and far more than all, so situated, as to
command with great advantages the.rich
est commerce of the world, the East In
dies.-the Oregon Territory, will, at n:
far distant period, assume an importance
thnt has been little dreamed of. The
commerce of the Pacific Islands, which
are fast progressing in civilization, will be
alone of inconceivable value, and from nad
other point can that commerce be carried
on with such facilities as from the coast of
the Oregon. In fctet, both from its inteV'
nal resources and -from its favorable posi
tion in regard to other countries, the Ore.
gon Trerritory is marked for a great and
prosperons country. Nothing is wanting
but a population with the industry and en
terpirize which' ha" characterized the bar"
dy pioneers of the Western States. and
cities will spring tp in a hundred places;
ships will aseend the magnificent Column
bia River, and leave upon its banks the
production, of every climate, receiving ia
return the rich furs, the fish, and the agri
cultural produciions of that country.
England, upon ,whose vast dominions
the sut never sets, and over whose inter
ests the spirit ofaimbition and territorial
conquests watches with as sleepless an eye,
has long since known 1mnd appreciated the
vast ilportance of the Oregon Territory.
11 is the point wanting to complete her
commercial ascendancy. With Gibralta
and Multa she can control the Mediterra
nean: 'Bermnda and Trinidad, Jmaies
an:d her North Ameri-an -possessions, fur
nish her strongholds. from which her fleets
can sweep the At;antic. and return in safe
ty; New Holland, a continent in itself, se
cures to her the- Southern Ocean, and ier
vast possessions in India, give her the
trade or the East. She lacks a plado
which will command the rich and increas
ing commerceo of the Pacific Ocean, a
commerce which is daily growing in ex
tent and importance, and which if'properly
pursued, would probably yield a riche r
return than atny which floats upon the
Ocean.
