PATENT COTTON GIN. I
' ? CD HIS Gin can be made double, or single. If *
f R made double, they reduce labor, and gin just '
double, the quantity of cotton over the single cylin- .
der Gih, no other knd having been In use prevous j
to this patent; and whether single or double, they !
are found to improve tho quality of the cotton, by k
more perfectlycleaning it. They can be made to
contain from 20 to 1G0 saws in a stand, and whether
small or large, one hand will be Zufficlent to attend <j
them. The Gins bkve mechanical feeders and
* hoppers attached to them, which free the cotton
' from leaves, trash, dirt, &c. before it can reach the
f % t- - - * - "
, Haws, ana oy me morougn hackling operation it
receives from the feeders, which make two revo- ^
' lutions to one of the saws, it is almost in a half
' gined stale, before it descends to the saw By a
very simple arrangement of a screw to each set of
gaates, on which the hoppers rest, aitd through ,
which the teeth of the feeders pass, they can be
made to teed slow or fast to suit the condition of
the cotton at the time. When made double, the .
saws are placed on two sets of cylinders and turn
upon eaeh other in opposite directions, and are i
cleansed by two sets df brushes that have four revolutions
to one of twe saw. The two cylinders can
be detached so as to enable the planter to run one ?
or both at pleasure, although embraced with feeders,
dkc. in one stand. The whole is put in operation
with a drum and band, as in the ordinary Gin, and
may be propelled "by horse, steam, or water power
It may also be propelled by iron running gear. >
j The force required to work H^is about the same as
that necessary to move an equal number of saws in r
the common Gin. This Gin has been put in
' operation in New Orleans for two or three weeks,
' and its success tested in the pretence of a large
f number of planters, merchants and others, and ?
received their general approbation f
Several gentlemen have been ho kind as to give 1
i the Patentee their written opinion respecting the 8
I merits of the Gin. A number of others could be
> added, but the following are deemed sufficient: ?

quality of the cotton, as it comes ont of the pro- .

accompanied by a specimen of the cotton, ginned
by yourTatent Gin, I beg leatfo to observe, that it

cess of ginning; delivering the staple uninjured
add fi*e from Jiap or trash, clean and of good co*
lor; thereby giving the article on additional value.
These favorable impressions of the advantages of
your PatenfGin, have been confirmed by subsequently
witnessing it in operation. The utility of
the double cylinders and saving of labor, will bo
readily perceived and properly appreciated by the
intelligent planter.

Dr. A Jorerf?Dear Sir, in ansWci tc your ine,ui*y
of my opinion of your Patent Cotton Gin, 1
?cg leave to state, that 1 was fifteen years engaged
in the cotton factories of Manchester. Engand,
and'during four years of that tin.e, I'-wits
"oreman in the house of Messrs. Lewis, AN illinnr.e
& Co., odd near five years spinner in the In ure of
Messrs. Sandford & Gricnc. 1 have seen your
Cotton 'Gin in operation, and have exrminrd ti e
totton ginned by it, and pronounce it better elcnr.icd,
and the staple less injured, than an}- cotton
hat overcame under mv observation. It is ccmiletely
ready for the breaker without the aid tf the
>lower, and would, therefore, save the first process
n manufacturing the article. 1 consider cotton
deansed by your Gin, would command from tr.o
to two centa on the pound more than the averree
liops brought into the Manchester market, oiid

It is desirable, w hen planters give ordeis for Gins,
hey should accompony them with their views jn
egard to the arrangement of snws, breasts, brushs,
&c. It is found they difler in opinion. Sen e
esire sows of larger diameter than others. Tie
nost common size is 9 or 10 inches ; but seme with
hem 12 inches. Some wish 5 or (J rows of brushes
nan axle, while others do not wont mote than 4
. iiiubi. onmc wisn saws Willi W or J) teeth lo the
ich. while other* wont 10 or 11. With so much
iscrepancy, we prefer thc-y should, at the timfcrf
ivin<r order*, furnish a statement of their wishes,
nd the mantifscturerers can fulfil them in every
articular. Where it is left to cur dircrcticH, uV*
mil make them on the most modern nnd approved
Ian. An order can be executed, from the time it
i received, in the space of eight or nine weeks
nd the Gin in that time placed in the hands of J he
ictor. To be in time for the next crop, nil ortiert
