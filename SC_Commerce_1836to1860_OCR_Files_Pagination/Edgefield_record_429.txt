only apology we can offer, for intruding
upon the columns of our valuable paper.
In cultivating our crop ofeorn the present
year. we were driven from trecessity (a
lago crop and much rain) to pursue some
what.a different course to our usual cus
tom: -we commenced by rinnin' round
our-corn, when young; with what we call
a bull tongue. following with a large com
mon shovel, filling the furrow, and laping
the dirt to the corn; thils completed the first
plonghing, which left a ridge between the
rows not ploughed, as a matter of course.
The second plotghitig. and last for a part of
our crop,wa-1 done with latge common shov
els, we ploughed tle rows out and out, in
consequence of a fine crop, both of weeds
and grass which has nearly taken the corn;
this was (lone when the ground was in fine
order Some two or three weeks had elap
sed, before we returned to the corn; by this
time General Green had marcl.ed in hii
forces, posted his sentinells, and took coin
plete possession of the flId; we however
watched his movements very closely, & ev
ery opportunity we were preparing for bat
tlie, notwithstanding we were very fearful,
from the advantage he had taken of the
ground that we would not be able to rout him
and his forces,without the assistnuce of Gen,
Frost; we however, after much preparation
made an attact o Lt Monday morninig,
thinking before Saturday night we would
have gained a complete victory. but not
withstanding we had a hot tiae for it; we
fought hard, and for the first two or three
dnys, we were in fite spirits, as there wer'
many slain and wounded hut the ratn began
to fail, and continued for two or three days,
which seemed to have quite a ditlerent
effect upon the minds of the two atrmies;
we however renewed the attack, with
our twisters in complete order, but by the
time we got about halfover our field, we
were attacked by a re-enforcement fron
a adljac ent cotton field; orders were
immediately given to repair to the spot.
-as they had attacked the very centre and
tmait support of our army: the orders were
no sontier given than obeyed; we cottinued
to operate successfully upon this part of
the old Gen. army, until our crop was laid
by. But enaotgh of this kitid of stuff.
The fact I wish to communicate to Sou.
iq that our crop of corn was plough-ed three
times, with the exception of about half of
a ltrge field. " hieh was onl'y phoughed
twice; and what astonishes me more, 6.
that the corn that was worked the leatt, is
decidedly the best on the pllantation,
and perhaps the finest grass pasture you
every saw. Will some old experienced
planter give us an essay on plantig and
ploughing corn. and " hether there is atv
uliTrence in the corn of a red or white
silk. By so doig tthey will oblige a
