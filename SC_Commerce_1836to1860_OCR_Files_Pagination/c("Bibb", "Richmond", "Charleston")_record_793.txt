by the way; and a similar one, I am lure, ought
to be adopted by the pastors of churches, especi
ally in large cities. It might offend some and
make others wonder, but it is absolutely necessa
ry, ih order to have any time for study.—D’Au
btgni is President of the Theological Seminary,
• and professor of Ecclesiastical History.—It is
now vacation, and all his leisure hours are devo
• ted to his great work on the History of the Re
form ition. He speaks .with much enthusiasm
of his labours, without, however, the least ap
pearance of boasting. “ If the Lord spares me
till I’m fifty," be says, “I’ll have out two or three
volumes more.” He has a brother in New Or
leans, and another in New York, who often and
earnestly invite him to make a visit. It is not
unlikely, therefore, that we may yet see this dis
tinguished man in our own country. I spent
Monday evening with him at the house of Col.
Trochin, the president of the Evangelical So
ciety. The professors of the institution and sev
eral of the pastors were present, as nlso Mr.
John J. Gurney, of London, and Dr. Hough, of
Glasgow. The latter gave a most interesting
account of the present state of religion in Scot
lane, connected with the late remarkable, and 1
rn ist say, glorious secession from the Established
Caurch. Mr. Gurney read a portion of Scrip
ture and offered prayer at the close of the inter
. view. Mr. Gaussen, author of the admirable
work on the Plenary Inspiration of the Bible,
was expected to be present, but, greatly to my
regret, was absent. I was resolved, at all events,
to see him, so I went next day on board of the
~ boat in which he was to sail. I introduced my
Self, uni found him, probably from the circum
stance of my earnestness,unusually free and com
municative.—He spoke in high terms of Mr.
Kirk’s translation of his work. He is farther
advance ! in years than I expected, but looks ro
bust and vigorous, an 1 will, I hope, farther in
struct anl interest U3 with his writings. He has
written an Exposition of Daniel’s Prophecies,
of which Dr. D’Aubignfi speaks very favourably.
I wish Mr. Kirk would give us a translation ol
- it. It would be well received in America at any
time, but especially in 1843..,

HIGH SCHOOL IN OREGON.
Brother Wightman:—In a late number of your
paper I find a most interesting, soul-stirring article,
by thaRav. D. Leslie, on the subject of Oregon, in
which he urges, most forcibly, the necessity of
establishing, immediately, a HighSchol in that Ter
ritory, under the patronage of the Methodist E.
Church. The subject is one astoundingly interest
ing, it has sent a burning thrill through my own
soul, and the object of this communication is to call
attention to that article, and to awaken, if possible,
an interest in some bosoms, upon this most impor
tant subject.
Let any one look over the map of Oregon and see
what a vast territory it is, through which the broad,
deep, Amazon-like Columbia, rolls his waters into
the Pacific. What a vast population will, at no
distant day, teem in that beautiful, rich, romantic
region. Oregon has but one outlet to the ocean,
and there will soon spring up a mighty commercial
emporium which, to use the graphic language of
Colonel Benton, “will be a Tyre, queen of cities;
she will have but one capital and that will be a
Thebes.” Hundreds of families are now pouring
into that country, and soon the last traces of the
red man will disappear; the deep, dense forests,
will give place to the riches of agriculture, and that
whole region will groan with a living, moving,
bustling population, bound for the fearful judgment
seat of Christ. Who shill provide for the intellec
tual and spiritual wants of this embryo nation?
Gj.1 has clearly shown, as brother Leslie says, that
it is the duty,of the Methodist E. Church to do it.
Long ago He stirred up the poor Flat-heads to
come across the mountains and the wilderness and
implore help of our beloved church. Missionaries
went, and “ what hath God wrought” by their
hands? Why thanks,eternal thanks to His name,
multitudes of Oregon’s, children now rejoice in the
love of a precious Redeemer. Thus has God
shown most clearly that the field of Oregon is, to a
great extent, allotted to Methodist culture. Shall
we now prove recreant to the rich trust thus re-!
posed in us by the providence of God. A school of
the highest grade, should be established there with
out delay. Already Jesuitical priests, like a swarm
ol iocustB let out trom me eouomiess pit, nave
alighted there, ami are sowing the seeds of corrup
tion and moral, death among the people ; and unless
something is done, and that quickly, their blighting.
P Bohon-Upas influence will cover all that land.—
“Men of Israel help,” is brother Leslie’s motto,
and would to God the Holy Ghost might impress
the call upon the heart of every Methodist in the
nation. Ten-thousand dollars—only the pitiful sum
of ten-lhnusand dollars,—is asked hy this good
brother for the grand object contemplated. He
asks”he preachers upon the circuits and stations to
bring the subject before their people, and have
their contributions carried up to the General Con
ference of 1844. Beloved brethren in the ministry,
ye whose hearts burn within you for the salvation
of your race, whose lives are a constant scene of
labor and self-denial, shall this appeal fall on your
ears in vain 1 No, no, it cannot be. I cannot be
lieve you will refuse to conic up to the “helpol
the Lord against the mighty” in this matter.—
Bring it, bring it, before all your congregations, and
beg and plead for Oregon. Think on the helpless
millions whose temporal and eternal interests you
will thus subserve. A gigantic commerce will soon
be established between Oregon and China, and the
whole of Eastern Asia will thus be thrown open to
missionary enterprize. O come forward, dear breth
ren, and establish, beyond tho Rocky mountains, a
Pharos of intellectual and moral glory whose radi
ance shall stretch far and wide, covering with light
the “dark places of thfe earth, which are full of the
hibitations of cruelty.”
Would to God 1 were on a circuit or station, in
s'ead of occupying, as I do, a local situation ; then
would I bring this subject before my people, and
ring it in their ears day and night; like Peter the
hermit, I’d beg them on my knees, and with tears
in my eyes, till I stirred the warm blood in their
hearts, and elicited contributions large enough to
assure me that a High-school would certainly le
established in Oregon. William Houser.

•SAVANTS AH RIVER MISSION, S. C. CON.
To Rev. W. Caters, Corresponding Secretary of the
Missionary Society of the Methodist E. Church, for
t le Southern Couiercnccs.
Dear Brother,—After some delay, which was
made to inform ourselves more fully as to the state
of this mission, we now forward our first and second
quarterly reports;—in which we feel glad to say,
wo met with a heady welcome {rum waiters, over.
•®er», and servants, This misaion ia one, in which
•il who ara acquainted with and who know and feei
the love of God, will and must feel great interest.
Many of the coloured people are already Christiana:
but among aome of them are to be found tbe
strongest prejudices in favour of some of tbe gros
sest errors. With these, we have tried our skill,
and fee) some degree of pleasure in stating that our
work and labour have not been in vain. Upon oor
arrival at this mission, we found four hundred,and
ninety-eight church members. Eleven have died;
eight have, been expelled; and two hundred and
twenty-four have been admitted on trial; making in
all, seven hundred and three.' We have taken in
two new appointments at which we preach, making
in all, ten preaching places, which are served with
the word of gospel salvation regularly every two
weeks. We now catechise on sixteen plantations;
five of them having been taken in the present year.
The whole number of children under our cate
chetical instruction, is now two hundred and thirty.
We have baptised one hundred and twelve adults
and children. And we now take great pleasure in
etating, that we believe the mission to be in a pros
perous condition.
There are many interesting facts relative to the
Christian experience of this people, -which, if time
and place would allow, we should be delighted to
state. We will, however, mention two of them, as
follows:—During a love-feast, while many were
telling of their present, as well as their past Chris
tian experience, an opportunity was offered to the
coloured members; after which, many spake freely
and much to the purpose. One man, at length,;
rose and said, "I know that religion is true; 1
know that the grace of God can make all things
new. I was once a poor pilfering negro, stealing
from master and doing many such things : But at
one time, I went to the praise-house, and there 1
found that I was a sinner, and there I sought and
obtained mercy,—and now I know I am a new
creature in Christ Jesus." The next, is the testi
mony of an old man who was very ill. He had
obtained a good report in bis experience. On being
isked, if it should be the will of his heavenly Mas
ter to take him away, whether he was willing to
go, and was not afraid to die; “Massa,” said he,
“when 1 go out of my house, if I have my ticket 1
lint afraid to meet the patrol. Well, Massa, 1 got
my ticket,” laying his hand upon bis bosom, “here
it is, the witness is within.” This brought most
forcibly to our minds, that Scripture, “ If our hearts
condemn us not, then have we confidence toward
him.” And such is the testimony of many. May
the Lord increase the number daily, and may the
blessing of the new and everlasting covenant be
richly enjoyed by masters and servants, until all
shall be brought to the knowledge of salvation by
-he remission of sins through faith in Jesus Christ.
We have great cause for grateful acknowledg
ment to Almighty God for his mercy toward and
protection over us. With but comparatively little
exception we have enjoyed our usual health. And
with the prayer that we may always enjoy his pro
tection and mercy, and that Zion may have peace
in all her borders,—permit us, dear brother, to sub
scribe ourselves, as ever, in Gospel bonds, truly
yours, Michael Robbins. 4

APPEAL IN BEHALF OF LIBERIA. *
Dear Brother Wightman,—Some short time ago,
the Rev John Seys, made an appeal through the
| columns of the Christian Advocte and Journal, to
the class-leaders of our church, with which I wat
; much pleased, and hoped that it would meet a heart)
reception in all our congregations. The duties of <
minister are very many and arduous, and any helj
| that they may receive, in carrying on the grea.
plans of the church, let it come from whence ii
may, will be regarded as additional testimony, thai
the whole church is waking up to a just apprehen
sion of its responsibilities.
And I am fully persuaded that in our economy'
there is a vast responsibility abiding on our class
leaders. And especially so as to the mission depart
ment of our work. The “appeal” ot brother 8. is
well-timed, and is made in the right direction.
It is a grave question with some, whether or not
a church that iB deeply involved in pecuniary re
sponsibilities, should contribute as liberally as it
otherwise might to those more general objects. But
if this should be the policy of the church, the Bible
Society, the Missionary Society and all kindred
institutions would necessarily go by the board. The
more enlightened policy, and that which living
“ faith in God” indicates, is to give to every worthy
object according to our several abilities, “Not
grudgingly, or of necessity,,for God lovelh a cheer,
ful giver.”
One of our leaders (others will do it) has read
the above named appeal, to his class, without wait
ing to be prompted to it. And one of his members
handed him five dollars, and others will follow the
example the first opportunity. I trust every leader
will do his duty in this matter ; and success, 1 am
sure, with the blessing of God, will crown his efforts.

CAPE FEAR MISSION, S. C. CON.
To Rev. W. Capers, Corresponding Secretary of the
Missionary Society oi the Methodist E. Church, for
the Southern Conferences.
Dear Brother,—My first quartyly report, I fear,
failed of reaching you, as it did not, I believe, ap
pear in the Southern Christian Advocate. Since
that time, I have received on trial two white and
eighteen coloured persons; expelled one black;
dropped two blacks: two coloured members, and
three of tho catechumens have died. In reference
to the other points referred to in your late “ Mis
sionary Notice,” I have nothing to report for the
quarter.
The state of the mission I still regard healthy
upon the whole ; though at this season, the great
labour and exposure of harvesting thins the con
gregations considerably; while keeping off1 the rice
birds from the ripening crop, prevents greatly the
attendance of the children at the catechetical visi
tations. I hope for better times as the fall ad
vances, and pray that God’s blessing may rest upon
the worn. Very respectfully,
Sept. 23,1843. M. C. Turrentine.
Facts for the Skeptical. — In four groups of
islands in the Pacific ocean, where, thirteen years
ago, the people were idolaters, and most of them
cannibals, there are now 40,000 members of Chris
tian churches. In one district in Southern India,
the Church Missionary Society have 19,000 candi
dates for baptism, and 693 communicants. In New
Zealand, in a district of the island, the average at
tendance of the natives upon divine worship is 7,517;
candidates for baptism, 1,400; native Christians,
898. By tlie labors of missionaries of the Ameri

INSTABILITY IN RELIGION. i
Change is the great law of human circumstan
ce*. This, by some subtle sympathy, not unfre
'luently leads to inconstancy in human opinions,
principles, and modes of action. Unfortunately,
ihe sphere of religious sentiments and habits claims
no exemption from this general tendency. Obser
vation shows that even here, where one might rea
sonably suppose that interests so momentous, claims
so imperative, motives, so influential as those
which belong to religion, might sway a perpetual
and increasing authority over man, here alas,
change, declension, alienation are frequently to be
found. Against how many who once ran well,
may the change be brought,—“thou hast left thy
| tint love.” Advenity sometimes produces the
change by being made the occasion of undue anx
iety, distrust of God's providence, and murmuring
| against his allotments. Prosperity however, is
found to be the most fruitful source of religious
declension. The heart insensibly shifts its trust
from the living God, and reposes its confidence in
worldly securites. The dormant spirit of pride is
quickened into new life. The self-flatteries of an
easy and satisfied soul, shut out the once loved
communion with the supreme Good. Apathy
steals apace over the vital energies of piety; and
long before the forms and proprieties of the reli
gious life are abandoned, the fires of genuine piety
have burnt down and gone out on the altar of the
heart. The indulgence of some secret bosom sin
eats into the soul with the tooth of a cancer; or
| some sudden temptation finds the citadelof virtue
I with unbarred gates, and enters before the un
guarded mind has time to rally its forces and give
I battle to the foe.
| Whatever may have been the occasion of reli
gious declension, and however rapid or tardy its
tdvance, it comes with a fearful influence over the
whole character of personal Christianity. It dis
honours the truth of God, it disparages the claims
>f religion. It sows the seeds of practical unbe
iefand produces not unfrequently the crop of
ivowed scepticism in the end. The claims of God
issert a right to the whole heart. They demand
everence and obedience at all times. Whatever
ibligation therefore, exists for being religious at alL
s an obligation which binds us to be religious
illoays. To cultivate religious feelings and prin
ciples to-day, and to-morrow to turn to the earth’s
seductions, and still hope to resume on the next
day our convictions and principles, as one would
put off and on one’s garments,—is so far to dis
credit and dishonour the authority of Christian
duty as to vitiate our whole conception of the mat
ter. What else is it but to nullify, to all practical
intents, the authority of the entire claim of Chris
tianity. The insidious element of infidelity thus
steals into the understanding; and soon the mind
comes to stand in doubt of its earlier convictions.
Conscience is trifled with. By degrees the moral
perception uccuines uameneu. aii neanny lorce
departs from the spiritual sensibilities. The maU
ter is hushed up with conscience on the plea that
hereafter a better obedience shall atone for present
acknowledged delinquencies. And so we become
dishonest with ourselves, insincere before God.
Presently the foundations of religious principle
cave in, and the soul is a wreck, without our having
dreamed of such an impending catastrophe.
This is the usual course and fatal termination of
instability in religion. To allow the mind any pot
sibiltly of retraction, even for a moment, from its
convictions ;—the heart any latitude of wavering in
its determinations;—to the will any departure from
the strictest adherence to religious duty, is to put
in peril all that is clear in our perceptions of divine
truth, all that is precious in our experience of di
vine grace. It is not saying too much to affirm
that Christ will have the whole heart or no part of
it. lie must occupy the throne of the affection?,
and govern with undisputed sway the powers of
will, conscience, desire, thought and habit, or he
will have nothing to do with us. Common as we
find the religion of circumstances, with its periodi
cal phases, like the changes of the moon;—and
like the same inconstant orb ruling the tides of the
soul with ever varying flow ; now producing the
rising flood, then the falling ebb; still the religion
of genuine, gracious, and saving power, is at all
times, and under all circumstances, one and the
same. Or if it allows of change at all, its change
is one of perpetual progress:—a change into the
glorious image of Christ, from glory to glory, by
the Spirit of the Lord. It allows no leaving of
the foundations but that which builds upwards unto
perfection. It begets that superiority to the world’s
opinion, that fearless independence of the world’s
dread laugh or tempting smile, which in the olden
time gave martyrs to the flame, and filled the
church with confessors who were ready to die for
the truth’s sake;—which in later days has held men
steady in their attachment to principles which en.
tailed persecution, loss of caste, and every other
contumely which ever tested human virtue or en.
nobled human endurance. Under the promptings
of its lofty spirit, the true disciple of Christ is
ready to say, I ban* deliberately chosen the service
of God. I have counted the coat I believe and
atn persuaded that Christ Jesus is able to keep
what I have committed to his trusti unto the day of
his glorious manifestation. .Nor life nor death
shall move me from my steady purpose. Come
what may in the future,. nothing shall shake my
present determinations or affect my deliberate
choice. And dying as living I shall, by God’s
grace, hold to the great principles which now gov
ern my life. May the church be filled with such
professors as these. . •' ' -„'J •••.
MISSIONARY FUNDS. ^
The following tables show the amount raised by
the several Conferences for the support of missions
in the two preceding years, and the comparative dif
ference. By these statements it appears that in the
last year, there wasa falling off in most of the Con
ferences, while in a few there has been an increase.
From the best information we can obtain there will,
no doubt, be a greater falling off the present year.
And here I beg leave to inquire, Whether this state
of things ought to existl Whether it is necessary
it should exist! It is admitted that money io some
sections of the country is scarce, but then if our
hearts were inspired as they should be with the love
of Christ, and love to the precious, yet perishing
souls of men, should we not be able, with our
unexampled increase of membership, not only to
prevent this alarming annual diminution of missiona
ry funds which stares us in the face, but so to in
crease I hem as to enable us to respond at least to a
lew of the many calls from heathen lands for help!
O, brethren of the ministry and membership, were
we filled with that love which induced Him who
was rich to become poor that we through his pover
ly might be rich, a mighty change would soon be
produced, not only in the state of our funds, but in
all our missionary operations. Men would be found,
and means provided to send the gospel to the ends
of the earth. G. Lame, Treas.

POLITY OF THE METHODIST E. CHURCH.
The late attack upon the Methodist E. Church in
the columns of the Southern Baptist Advocate, led
us to ask in respectful terms of its editor, whether
we understood him to endorse the injurious and un
just statements therein contained. We have the
satisfaction to be informed that the friends of Meth
odism must submit to have the peculiarities of their
system of church government, “ handled,—and that
a little roughly." Very well, Doctor; if you have
a special call to this vocation, let it be so: we sim
ply wished to know whether you had changed your
views as to the expediency of beginning a war
against the Methodists, so that neither of us might
get into a false position. We have no favours to
ask at the hand of the Baptist Advocate; we de
precate no discussion so long as we stand clearly
on the defensive. If,our neighbours think that it
will promote the glory of God, and tend to the lur
therance of “ peace on earth and good will among
men,” to commence this strife, we have nothing
more to say. Ce n'etlque le premier pas qui coute.
We have the satisfaction yet to believe that we
•hall hud in Dr. Curiia au intelligent aud gentle*
manly antagonist; we doubt If we bare a right to
•ay aa much for all hii correspondent*.
True charity we know, i* “ not easily provoked.”
And yet it if a characteristic of the same charity
that it “ rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoieetb in
the truth." But let the reader judge of the provo
cation. Why, it is charged in the columns of the
Baptist paper against Methodism, and in italics with
al, that her form of government “ is unecripturdl,
anti-republican, unjust, and tyrannical." Our epis
copacy is termed a ridiculous burlesque of episco
pacy ; the preachers are charged with having legis
lated the whole power over the temporal concerns of
the church, out of the people's hands, and into their
own. Methodism is said, from ^the beginning, to
have u assumed a position at war with the scriptures
and rights of man, sanctioning the dogma of abso
lute and irresponsible power, and attempting to
sanctify it by the awful authority of religion.” The
ultimate tendencies of the system are represented
to be dismal in the extreme. It is fitting the mul
titudes who are under its control, for political slave
ry. It is aiming covertly, at the destruction of the
liberties of the American people. It works on to
the subversion of “ the privilege and rights of self
government” amongst the citizenship of the coun
try, and strips from Christian men the liberty where
with Christ had made them free. And to cap the
climax of these calumnies, it is hinted in the wind
ing up of the article that "some things are said
about Auricular Confession, etc."
Now we coolly pronounce this fanfaronade, a
tissue of indecent abuse; a malignant, false, and un
proved string of declamatory assertions. And we
pledge ourselves to answer satisfactorily every one
of these charges, just so soon as proof to sustain
them is attempted by the Biptist Advocate or any
of its correspondents. Let them take their gloves
off and go to work as soon as they please.

AMERICAN BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS
FOR FOREIGN MISSIONS.
Thia Board held ita thirty-fourth annual meet
ing in Rochester, N. Y., commencing on the 12: h
September, the Hon. T Frelinghuysen in the
chair. The annual aermon before the board, was
preached by the Rev. Dr. Skinner of New York.
The Board has under ita care 28 missions, 28
stations, at which there are 131 ordained mission
aries, eight of whom are physiciass, 15 teachers, 10
printers and book-binders, six other male and 178
female assistant missionaries, making the whole
number of missionary laborers sent from this coun
try, 348, which is eight less than the number last
year. If to these be added 14 native preachers and
116 other native helpers, the whole number of mis
sionary laborers connected with the missions and
sustained from the treasury of the Board, will be
478, which is 10 less than were reported last year.
Under the care of these missions, there are 62
| churches, to which 2,690 were added last year,
making an aggregate of 20,797 members in com
munion with the churches organized by the mis
| sionaries of the Board.
The expenses during the year amounted to
3256^87.85. The income during the same period
was $244,224.43, leaving a debt of upwards of
$13,000. The report states that the station at
Jerusalem has been suspended. Mr. Lanneau is
to reside at Beirout It is said that the late meet
ing of the Board was held under circumstances
the most cheering, and that its friends have ample
reason for sanguine expectations as to the future.
RECENT PUBLICATIONS.
A Review or the Controversy on Baptism be
tween the Rev. J. H- Kilpatrick and John J.
Trigg*, and an appeal to a candid public. By
John J. Triggs, Minister of the OospeL Charles
ton : B- Jenkins. 1843.
This is a pamphlet of some thirty pager, which
does great credit to the understanding, learning,
and temper of Mr. Triggs. It is a complete and
masterly exposure of the misrepresentations of Mr.
Kilpatrick’s last publication, while it furnishes an
ample and unanswerable argument in favour of the
pedo-baptist positions maintained by Mr. Triggs in
his “Treatise.” Much valuable information on
the general subject in dispute between the Baptists
and the rest of the Christian world, will be found in
these pages, which we take great pleasure in re*
commending to the attention of all who feet any
interest in the controversy.
French without a Master. In six Easy Les
sons. First American from the Fourth Brussels
Edition. Neu> York: Wilson and Co. 1843.
Our old French master would have shaken his
head sadly over the pretensions of any book which
affected to teach the language of La beUe France, in
as summary a style as does the work before us.
And yet we are not prepared to say that much val
uable instruction may not be found in this publica
tion. It is certainly worth a great deal more than ,
twenty-five cents, the price at which it is offered to !
the public. The course of lessons it comprises
aims at giving an explanation of the chief difficul- 1
ties which the learner has to encounter, and to
show the diligent student, without the aid of any
kind of oral instruction, the way into the materiel of
the language. It may be obtained at the office of
the publishers, New York; or of A. Head, Charles
ton ; or S. A. Holmes, Augusta, the postage not
costing more than five cents for any distance over
a hundred miles.
Letter Writing : by Charlotte Elizabeth. First
American from the second London Edition. New
York: J. S. Taylor and Co. 1843.
The estimable and accomplished lady, known to
the reading world as Charlotte Elizabeth, seems
inclined to introduce her peculiar religious senti- 1
ments more fully into the productions of her pen,
as her works multiply. In the correctness of these
views we do not believe. We have no liking for (
her calvinistic opinions : and whatever general re- |
commendation we have at any time given to her {
publications, must be received with the abatements ,
made necessary by the foregoing statement. The
little book before us, presents in animated narra
tive form, the evils to which a too extensive and
trifling epistolary correspondence among young
ladies is generally liable. Many valuable hints are
thrown out as to the proper way of managing such a

Civilization and knowledge hid exhausted their re

exhausted all that the military force of France

of Continental Europe, and all that the industry of
England bad accumulated of credit during past
centuries of pacific exertion. Nor were the skill
and science of the leaders in this memorable strug

to command, or the vital interests for which they
contended: the genius of Napoleon, equal to that
of Cesar or Hannibal, all bat overbalanced the
heroism of Alexander and the science of Goeiaenau,
which may fairly be placed beside that of Scipio or
Epaininondaa; and the cause for which they con
tended, was not the conquest of provinces or the
plunder of cities, but the liberation of the human
race from universal oppression, or the establish
ment of universal dominion upon an immovable
foundation.

The King or the French. — A deputation from
the London Peace Convention, at the head of which
was the Rev. Mr. Toase, Wesleyan Missionary in
Paris, had an audience with Louis Philippe on the
20th July at his Palace of Neuilly, to present the
Address on the Convention.
“ Our reception,” says one of the number, “was
all we could desire. • I receive the address,’ said
his Majesty, • with great pleasure. It is a subject
in which we all have a deep interest; and I am sure
I have always done what I could to preserve
peace. When a young man, travelling in America,
(1795-6) I used, when called upon for a toast or sen
timent, to give,—a general peace.’ When assured
that his influence in preserving peace was fully
appreciated in America, his Majesty alluded with
regret to the danger of a war in 1835 between the
two countries, but added, • How happily we settled
the matter in the end without war, and honorably to
both nations.’ We told him we wished td supersede
all war by introducing arbitration as a substitute ;
and he readily expressed bis approbation of the
principle, and referred to the case of England and
America, of the United States and Mexico, and
several other instances, in illustration of its general
efficacy. 4 Still,* added the kiug,4 the bad passions
of men may frustrate our best efforts at conciliation.
Nor is this all; for we find one of our greatest dan
gers in the very means we employ for the preserva
tion of peace. You know we must have our armies
to keep peace; but unfortunately they are them
selves the instruments of war, and sometimes occa
sion the very evil they are intended to prevent.
Yet,’ continued his Majesty. 41 think the time is
coming when we shall get rid of war entirely in all
civilized countries. They are beginn.ng to learn
more wisdom; and, thank God, war now costs too
much for nations to afford it. Napoleon began his
great war with 35 millions in his treasury ; but
that was only a drop to the ocean in compariaion
witl^vhat those wars eventually cost.*
