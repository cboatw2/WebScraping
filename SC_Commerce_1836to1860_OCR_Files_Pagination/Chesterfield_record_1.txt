Thcv uriitc, perhaps, to a greater degree
i haii any other breed, the supposed incompatible
properties of yielding a great deal c f
milk and beef. It is,* however, us lUr. KanIda
well observes, on the inferior soil and
the moist climate of Ayrshire and the West
of Scotland, that their superiority as milkers
is most remarkable. On their natural food
?>f poor quality they give milk abundantly
and long, and often until within a few days
<>f calving; hut when tbey ore moved to
ri-'drn* pasture, their constitniion changes,
cud they convert their food more into beef.
In their ?.:wa counts*/ a cow of a fleshy make,
r.:id which seldom proves a good milker,
may br cas'ly raised to -10 or f>u stones, and
bullocks of three years old are brought to
ve.igh from o0 to (30 stones. There is a
lurking tendency about them to fatten, which
good pasture will briag to Jig!it. Tlicv arc
J.ot ftvorkes with the butchers as the fifthquarter
does not weigh well in them. Their
fat is mingled with the fl \sh rather than
separated in the form of tallow; yet this
would give a more beautiful appearance to
the meat, an 1 shoul.l enhance its price to the
consumer."
The preceding we copy from tbc Firrmcr

of cattle possesses the properties here
ascribed to it, which we sec no good reason
to doubt, it is unquestionably much better
adapted to the treat incut received by cattle
in the Carolinas, than any we now have;

Internal Improvements.
So rapkl has been the multiplication of-:
works of internal improvement in the United ;
States within a very few years, that proba- (
bly very few of our readers have any thing j
like correct knowledge ef their extent.? .
Tiio followiug extracts from a report of the
Committeo-oa Iuternal Improvement to one 1
branch of the Legislature cf Tennessee '
tko-V in session, will give soma idea of them. (
" The receipts of the Erie canal, which
extends from Buffalo to Albany, a distance 1
cf throe hundred and sixty three miles. 1
v.ere for the year 1933, one million seven
hundred and sovcnty-two thousand, three J i
hundred and sixty, four doUan?. Since 1933 j1
the ratcs of toll hare been reduced twenty- <
live per cent; yet the increase in the re- j
c dpts Ins exceeded the proportion of for- i
merycarj. Tne committee remark, that i
from the reports of the tolls of the present
year, there is no doubt ihat tho receipts will
considerably exceed two millions of dollars.
To? cost of the work was nine millions,
tw :i:ty.? wen thousand, four hundred and
tiny-six dollars. It is a remarkable fact i
eounucl^J with the trade on this artificial j
chmnel, that the tonnage employed on it, is j
c TU'il?. the whole tonnage, both domestic |
an : ibrcign. which annually crowds the '
harbor of M v York. Results of this
character, when predictions at first were
and foreboding, hail the friends of
Internal improvemement with cheering gratulation.
In addition to the Erie canal, the
other improvements cf this kind in New
York are, the Ciiampl iin, the Oswego, L'elnwuro
and Hudson, Haerlem, Chittenango,
las, Cayuga and Scncca, Chemung,
Crook-h ike and Ciienango canals,?

nut's, he u* vcr, have in New York, as
every where else, given place to rail roads..
All the new works of improvement are of
this lost description. The cost, the rapidity
A conimunic it ion, their capability of being
used during the whole year, give to rail
roads an indisputable superiority. The
rail roads finished in New York are the
Mohawk and Hudson, the Saratoga and
Schenectady, the Ithaca and Oswego, the
New York and Haerlcm, tho Renssalear
and Saratoga, llse Cutskiil and Canajoharie,
the Uiiea and Schenectady, the Buffalo and
Black Rock, aud tiie road from Rochester
to the head of navigation in Genesee river.
Works in progress in the State of New
d ork arc more numerous and extensive
than those completed. Among these are
the New York and Eric Rail Road, nearly
four hundred miles in length, the New York
and Albany Rail Road, the Hudson and I
Delaware, the Brooklyn. Jamaica and Long
Island, to cx:e.) 1 from New York two hundred
and twenty-five miles. The whole
distance of these four roads, now in prog,
ress, is between eight 'and nine baud red
miles. In addition to these, in the State -of
New York alone, are more than thirty rail
roads under charter, the ro'Jtcs surveyed,
and [.reparations in progress for their construction.
So superior is rail road commticlegation,
that from Albany to.New York, even alongside
the broad and beautiful bosom of the
Hudson, where steamboats ply every day,
and with remarkable rapidity, a rail way is
in progress, connecting points between
which ntlturc has spread one of the noblest j
xivc*?. Yfh ti * skiing common! on the
I spirit'of the age and the wonderful advance.,
|inert of human enterprise! Five years
I ago, men of intelligence spoke of these
1t-lings as chimeras, the dreams of the visionary.
lint the vivid reality now startles
the imagination even of the most sanguine
of those who gavo a willing car to the earlicst
inquiry.
In ellocting her public improvements, N.
\ ork has borrowed nearly thirty millions of i
dollars. Such of the bonds as have he. i
come due, have been n?-t and liquidated by j
the receipts from the works constructed.
Those which will be due, at future periods*
will be more easily paid than the first; the
1 receipts on the works, the bonds for the
construction of which have been cancelled,
will be a sinking fund to aid the tolls received
from other improvements in settling bonds
. j
payable at a luture time.
The State of Pennsylvania stands by N.
York ia public enterprise- Iler faith is
pledged for more than twenty millions, and
on tiie progress of her system and the policy
of its adoption, the fixed opinion of the
State, founded an reason and oxpeiicnce, is
unanimous. Her canals, embracing the
main division, the western, the Susquelfannah,
the north branch, the west branch divisions.
together with others, extend a distance
of six hundred miles. The most important
of her rail roads which arc complete*
1, extend front Philadelphia to Columbia,
upwards of eighty miles ; and the Alleghany
and Portage Rail Road, which passes the
Alleghany mountain at a point of grca'cr
ascent than any that woul 1 be overcame by
the roads which arc spoken of. In the bill
presented by the commitfco to the House.
Resides tiros'*, there are twenty other rail
roads constructed or in progress, constitu
ting n chain of communication winch
briig* c\c:y citizen of the Stat J within
reach of the benefits int tndod to be conferrod
by a system both comprehensive and
efficient.
Among the most important of these last,
works is the Central Kail Road, wliich commences
near Pottsvillo. and extoj?ds to Sunbury,
opposite the Susquchannah river, and
to Danville, making the whole distance fiftyone
mhos. The Philadelphia and Reading
rail road is of importance also, covering a
distance of fifty-eight miles, and intended to
connect an extensive anthracite coal .mine
with the city of Philadelphia.
fii New Kngland the same spirit has nc- .
tuated public and private exertion. In New
I Iampshtro and Vermont a number of canals
have been constructed; and in the lattor
State two rail roads arc in progress, the
principal of which is that from Whitehall to
Rutland. In Massachusetts there arc scvoral
canals iiutsc-; the most extensive are the
Middlesex, the Blackstone, and the Hampshire
and Hampden, in l.'iigth one hundred
and fifty miles. The raii roads are nuiner- <i
i?us and rabidly increasing. Tliosc from
Boston to Worcester, from Boston to Prov- <
idence and from Taunton to Lowell, and 1
several others are completed. Many more ;
are projected and in progress, including a
line which is to he carried through the States
of New-Hampshire and Vermont, passing

Maine, Rliode Inland and Connecticut, 5
have also been alive to their interests. The ,
former exhibits considerable progress in a.
work from Portland to Boston, and arrange,
nents arc in advance to connect Portland,
by rail road, with Quebec. Rhode Island
md Connecticut, though small in territory
md population, have constructed several
improvements; the most important arc the
Purmington Canal and the Stonington and
Providence rail road. Many other works
arc in progress in these States.
New Jersey, a country not remarkable
for the fertility of its soil or the extent of its
resources, has completed several canals and
n <ei!l riwiter number of rail roals. Of
O -tlic
former, the Morris and the Delaware
and the Iiaritan canals,embracing a distance
of one hundred and forty four miles, arc the
most extensive. Of rail roads, that from
Camden to Amboy, a distance of sixty-one
miles, and the Jersey and West-Jersey rail
roads, the one extending from Brunswick
to Jersey city, opposite New York, the other
reaching from Gloucester on the Delaware
to Salem, are, perhaps, the most important
; though many others of great public
utility are in progress or projected. Delaware,
too, has a canal from the Chesapeake
to the Delaware, and three rail roads
completed, from Newcastle to Frcnchtown,
from Wilmington to Downington, and from
Wilmington to the Sus^uchnnnah. Even
this little State has had the spirit of improvement
march onward.
If we cast our eye to Maryland, we discover
a hundred and ten miles of the Chesapeake
and Ohio canal completed, and some
smaller canak have been a long time in use.
Rail roads, however, have in this State dc.
monstrated, as they have elsewhere, their
superior utility, and her enterprise is now directed
chiefly to this species of improvement.
Of the Baltimore and Ohio Rail
Road, upwards of eighty miles have been
completed, and the route is continued, by
another company, to Winchester, tfhdor a
charter from the Stato of Virginia. The
Baltimore and Susquchannah rail road is
actively progressing, to reach York, in
Pennsylvania, a distance of seventy-six
miles/ The Baltimore and Washington
road is completed, and other works arc being
projected with every prospect of success.
The Dismal Swamp Canal, in Virginia,
and the James and Jackson river canals arc
important works, and the latter, by the intelligcnt
policy of the last Legislature, which
subscribed for three millions of stock, wili
new become a great and useful improvement,
oSbrding a communication from the
Ohio to the Atlantic. The Roanoke and
Petersburg rail road, extending sixty miles;
the Portsmouth and Roanoke; the Winchester
and Potomac; the Richmond, Fredericksburg
and Potomac; the Richmond
; and Petersburg, and the Manchester rail
roads, are finished or rapidly competing.
The entire length of these roads is two i
hundred atid seventy >s1x miles. The}- pre- J
sent the irfiicaticn of a system in Virginia j
which will undoubtedly be made co-extensive
with the interests of the whole State, of
North Carolina, too, has entered the field, th
and on her bosom exhibits an illustration of be
the temper of the age. An important work tu:
is actively advancing from Wilmington to vi<
the Yadkin, thence to the Catawba, a dis- wl
tance of two hundred and fifty miles. An- re
other rail road is also started, from New- th
b?rn, on the Ncuse, to Clinton, embracing
an interesting communication deeply important
to the countries it is proposed to conncet.
When North Carolina, a State remark
able for caution and prudence in do- q(
paring from ancient usage or in the adop. q
ticn of any thing new, has embarked in the
construction of rail roads, it is argument
conclusivs that they arc necessary and in- ^
dispensable to the public interest. If this
. ^,1 nml mrcnnnr.rtnd. it would *
UlUl J.vUmoumivu unu v....

The state of improvement in South Curolina
presents facts interesting and useful. ^ij
With characteristic spirit, she lias been Hi*
mong the foremost m adopting and exccuting
extensive improvements. Iler road ^
from Charleston to Hamburg has vindicated
by its success the wisdom of its adoption; jy
A'tberc is no doubt that its whole cost,with in- '
tercst,will be reimbursed in afew years. The
Columbia and Branchville rail road, covering
a distance of sixty miles, is commenced, ,
and also the road from Hamburg to Edge- . r'
fid.!.
In Georgia and Alabama, Missisrippi and 0
Louisiana, are various works projected or
in progress. In Georgia, the Athens and rc*
Augusta rail road, one hundred and fourteen P?
? - - - rvi
miles in length, is nor.* under eon'raet. in r~
the Florida, Alabama and Georgia rail road, ^
from Pcnsacoia to Columbus, two-thirds of

ro' is advancing, and also that from Wood- e.
viile, in Mississippi, to St. Francisville.

The value of real estate has, in a large extent

Among the memorials was one presented we
by Mr. Wright from 125 citizens of New the
York, in relation to the late fire in that city, set

in which it might be extended by Congress, an
After some remarks by Mr. Wright, the
Mr. Webster said he hoped the memorial die
would be printed with all possible despatch, pa
that the members of the Senate might have sw
an opportunity to read it. It appeared to sia
be a long and reasoned paper, stating the ab
grounds, both of right and expediency, on
which relief, in the specified modes, was Cr
asked. ^
The memorial was referred to the Com- tai
mittee on Finance. T1
Mr. Callioua gave notice lhat he should co
to-morrow ask leave to introduce a bill to of
regulate the deposites of the public money of sU
the United States; a bill to change the Con- on
stitution of the United States; and a bill in ru'
relation to the mail, and for other purposes, re
dec. 20. ci
Mr. Clay asked and obtained leave to in- *f
troducc a bill for the distribution of the pro- bii
ceeds of the public lands, which was twice 111
read and referred to the committee on Pub- A
lie Lands. up
From Mr. Clay's speech on the subject, to
reported in the National Intelligencer, wc
make the following extract. th<
The nett amount of the sales of the pub- an
lie lands in the year 1633 was the sum of w<
83,9G7,GS2 55, in the year 1S34 "Was 84,. dii
657,GOO GO, and in the year 1S35, according foi
to actual receipts in the three first quarters wl
and an estimate of the fourth, is $12,222,. co
121 15; making an aggregate for the three
years of 821,047,404 39. This aggregate cr
is what the bill proposes to distribute and hn
pay to the twenty-four States on tfie first day fie
of May, 1636, upon the principles which I fo;
have stated. The difference between the pr
estimate made by the Secretary of the Trea.
sury and that which I have offered of the hr
product of the last quarter of this year, ari- an
ses from my having taken, as the probable of
sum, one third of the total amount of the in
three first quarters, and he some other con. wi
jeetural sum. Deducting from the $21,047,. in'
404 39 the fifteen per cent, to which the
seven new States, according to the. biH, will th
be first entitled, amountingto $2,612.35018, to
there will remain for distribution among the cj
twenty-four States of the Union the sum of th
$18,435,054 21. Of this sum the proper- pc
tion of Kentucky will bo $960,947 41, ofjhr
Virginia the sum of $1,581,069 39, of} Si
North Carolina $988,632 42, and of Pcnn-1 si
sylvania $2,083,233 32. The proportion of j dc
I Indiana, including the fifteen per cent, will be: ar

By the arsival yesterday of the schooner
Jorge & Mary, Capt. Wille}', in 24 hours
m St. John's (E. F.) wc received the
ikson Courier of the 24th inst., from which
; have made copious extracts respecting
5 hostile operations of tho Indians in that
:tion of the country.
We have conversed with Uapt. wuiey,
d learn from him, that a large portion of
i territory has been desolated by the Inins,
the}' having made a descent irom that
rt of the territory occupied by them, and
epi every thing in their route, from Valul
to Black Creek, on the main road?>and
;o from the same point to Lake George,
d down the St. John's River to Black
eok, burning all the dweiiings in their
urse, and murdering such of the inhabits
as had not previously made their escape,
ic extent of the loss of life, could not of,
urse be correctlp ascertained, on account
the confusion that existed, but Capt. W.
ites that information reached Jacksonville
i fhn mnrrvrirrnf the 25th. that Mr. Wood
IT, and one negro, who were on Mr. For.
ster's plantation, had been killed, and that
lpt. Lancaster, of the militia, was seriously,
not mortally wounded. The .store and
adery establishment of Dr. Brush, at Polka,
were burnt down on Wednesday last,
boat from the George & Mary, was fired
ion, while on her way down Black Creek
St. John's Riv?r.
Wc Icam that tho Indians had removed
:ir women and children to a place of safety,
d that it had been ascertained that roads
itq sometime previously cut in different
rations, to reach the plantations, evidently
r the purpose of facilitating their purposes,
ion the scene of destruction should have
mmenced.
The effect of these disturbances on the
ops will be most disastrous, the planters
.ving been compelled to abandon their
Ids; and the mills and buildings necessary
r the manufactory of Sugars, arc most
obably all destroyed.
We learn that a passenger in the G. & M.
is brought on a letter requesting that arms |
id amunition may be forwarded, as many j
' the troops and volunteers are without any 1
cans of -defence, although every kind of
sapon that could be found had been pressed '
to the service.
In this case of emergency, it is to be hoped
at the most prompt measures may be taken
afford assistance to those who are thus
:posed to the incursions of the Indians,'and
at if it be found that the arms at the dis.

Religions Instruction of Stares in tl*j?

The Rev. Silas McKecn, of Maino, some time
since, addressed a letter to tho Rev. R. W. Baily,
of this town, making several inquiries at to the
advantages of religious instruction enjoyed by
the slavos in South Carolina. Mr. Bii'y replied
through the Christian Mirror, of Portland, in a
series of letters which were republished hi tho
New York Observer and several other religious
papers at the North; and which wo understand

In addition to some statistics already furnished,
in a previous letter, on the religious
improvement of the slaves, 1 am now able,
from authentic information, to say, that of
the five hundred and eighty thousand, which*
compose the entire population of this State)
about sixty-seven thousand are members in
the Baptist, Methodist, Presbyterian, and <
Episcopalian churches. Of these coiotbu. i.

The whole slave population is 315,000* It
is easily seen, therefore, that of the white
population about one ninth, and of the
slave population about one seventh arc
church members. It is proper these facts
should come into the estimate of the reli.
gious condition and prospects of our slaves.
In New England there are twenty thousand,
and in the free states a hundred and twenty
thousand free blacks. I should be glad to see .
a comparison oitlicir religious condition with
that of our slaves in this one item. Do
you believe that one twentieth of thorn arc , j
