Tu the Committee on the Improvement of i
Wet Meadow aud i*vvanip Land*: ?
Gentlemen?Fin: improvement that I
submit to your examination has been
made upon between five and six acres
of swamp land, situated in the tow n of
&tugus. The mud or soil varies from
two to twelve feet in depth. Two years
ago, it was so thickly covered with briars
and bushes, that a dog would have found
difficulty in passing through it. These
hushes 1 mowed and burnt on the ground.
There were so many stumps and logs
??.- :? ?.,1U imiMissibie to nlou?rh; so 1
tnai it ?no -...j - _ t u
commenced cutting the surface into
.squares altout fifteen incites each way,
and then with forked hoes, made very
strong, pulled ofi* the sod and cleared out
0 the stunt|>s and logs. Then using the
same hoes, cleared out all the small roots,
levelled the surface, and placed hack the
sods the other side up. This part of the
work I did in strips of about one rod in
width. In August, lc<37, I commenced
litis. In 1S33 I mowed the hushes and
dug one ditch. The stumps and logs 1
took out without lite help of oxen. Some
of the stumps I should judge had nearly
half a cord of wood in them. There
were a considerable number of trees that
had blown down, and the meadow had
formed over them. Many of them were
perfectly sound, and some measured sixty
feet in length. The stumps were very
numerous. 1 found three tier deep, and
? - ---- tl.?) U,l
under the bottom lay a pine iug, iiiai iiuu-i
some time or oilier been on fire. After
going over the surface and clearing in
the manner I have described, [ found the
expense to have been, at a fair estimate
Tor the labor, $501,
In the winter I hauled off ihe wood and
piled it up for coaling. The largest of
the small roots I selected for my own fire
?the smallest I burnt on the ground. I
commenced harrowing with an iron tooth
harrow, as soon as the frost began to
como out of the ground. The sods being
fastened down by the frost, and the harrow
passing over the upper side, they
n? fnst na the frost would
kiouiuviou - ?
admit; and when the harrow had got t(>
the depth of the sods, they were worked
up pretty fine, tho frost below making a
bridge for the team to pass on. About
the first of last May, I began planting
with |>otatoes, without any manure. 1
cut the seed very fine, and planted the
parts near together. I merely marked the
hills with a hoe, then a man followed after
with the seed, and then another man
to cover it. So [ made speedy work in
planting. I calcuftited to have the seed,
when covered, one inch from the surface.
1 used sixty.nine bushels of seed, that js,
?- ... i
about fourteen Dusuew iu ?u am,.
should not have seeded so light, had 1 not
felt an uncertainty about obtaining a
crop, without the use of manure. There
was but one man, among those whom I
consulted, who gave me any cncouagement.
Many said 1 should lose my labor.
To their astonishment I harvested U27
f bushels of excellent potatoes. The expense
incident to planting, hoeing^harvesting,
&c., including the seed, I estimate
at $117. The land is now in a
state that I can plough it at pleasure. On
a small pieco of the land I planted coin,
and it ripened well. On a small piece I
sowed wheat, but it came to no perfection,
either in the straw or grain.
The wood was converted into charcoal.
In 1837 I coaled 1201 bushels, which
sold in the market Tor ?166 4U. in lsaa
I coaled 4200 bushels, which sold on the
hearth for ?333 33, and I ascertained
from the purchaser that it sold in Boston
market for ?G30. I sold wood to the
amount of ?50, and I estimate that which
I used for my own fire worth ?50 more.
I have on hand one hundred cart loads
of the bottom of the coal pits, which I
value at ?75, having had some knowledge
of its virtue as a manure.
The account may he thus stated:

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
To the Senate and the House of
Representatives of the United Slates:
We have continued reason to express
our profound gratitude to the Great Cre.
ator of all things for numberless benefits
conferred on us as a People. Blessed with
genial seasons, the husbandman has his
gamers filled with abundance, and the
necessaries of life, not to speak of its luxurie8,
abound in every direction. While
in somo othcyiations steady and industrious
labor can hardly find the means of
subsistence, the greatest evil which we
have to encounter is a surplus of produc*
tion beyond the home demand, which
seeks, and with difficulty finds, a partial
market in other regions, The health of
the country, with partial exceptions, has
for tho past year been well preserved ; and
under their free and wise institutions, the
United States are rapidly advancing to.
wards the consummation of the high des.
tiny which an overruling Providence
seems to have marked out for them. Exempt
from domestic convulsion, and at
peace with the world, we arc left free to
consult as to the best means of securing
and advancing the happiness of the People.
Such are the circumstances under
which you now assemble in your respectire
chambers, and which should lead us
to unite in praise and thanksgiving to
that great,Being who made us, and preserves
us a nation.
I congratulate you, fellow-citizens, on
the happy change in the aspect of our
foreign affairs since my last annual mes.
sage. Causes of complaint at that time
existed between the United States and
Great Britain, which, attended by irrita.
ting circumstances, threatened most so.
riously the public peace. The difficulty
of adjusting amicably the questions at
issue between the two countries was in no
small degree augmented "by tho lapse of
time since they had their origin. The
opinions entertained by the Executive on
several of the loading topics in dispute
were frankly set forth in the Message at
the opening of your late session. The
appointment of a special Minister by
Great Britain to the United States, with
power to negociate upom most of the
points of difference, indicated a desire on
her part amicably to adjust them, and that
Minister was met by the Executive in
the same spirit which had dictated his
mission. The treaty consequent thereon ,
having been duly"ratified by the two Gov.
crnmcnts. The question of peace or war
between the United States and Great
Britain is n quostion of the deepest inter- <
est not only to themselves, but to the civilized
world, since it is scarcely possible
that a war could exist between them without
endangering the peace of Christendom.
The immediate effect of the treaty
upon ourselves wjll be felt in the security
afforded to mercantile enterprise, which,
no longer apprehensive of interruption,
* CI ?t
adventures its speculations in the most
distant seas, and, freighted with the diversified
productions of every land, returns
to hless our own.. There is nothing in
the treaty which in the slightest degree
compromises the honor or dignity of cither
nation. Next to the settlement of the
boundary line, which must always be a
matter of difficulty between States as hetween
individuals, the question which
seemed to threaten the greatest embarrassment
was that connected with the
African slave trade. By the 10th article
of the treaty of Ghent it was expressly
declared that "whereas the traffic in slaves
is irreconcilable with the principles of humanity
and justice, and whereas both His
Majesty and the United States are desirous
of continuing their efforts to promote
its entire abolition, it is hereby agreed
that both the contracting parties shall use
Andenvnm to accomplish so de
IIIVII V..-W- - . - #
sirable an object." In tho enforcement
of the laws and treaty stipulations of
Great Britain, a practice hpd thieatened
to grow up.on the part of its cruisers of
subjecting to visitation ships sailing under
the American flag, which, while it serious,
ly involved our maritime rights, would
subject to vexation a branch of our trade
which was daily increasing, and which
jequired the fostering care of the Governmcnt.
And although Lord Aberdeen, in
his correspondence with the American
envoys at London, expressly disclaimed
all right to detain an American ship on
i the high seas, even if found with a cargo
of slaves on board, and restricted the Bri?
tish pretension to a mere claim to visit
and inauire, yet it could not well be diserned
by tho Executive of the United
States how such visit and inquiry could
be made without detention on the voyage,
and consequent interruption to tho trade.
- i x r L
puiajf uiuiuiv^ w - ^
resorted to by the two Govern/rents to
settle their respective claims. It became
manifest at an early hour of the 'late negotiations,
that any attempt for the time
being satisfactorily to determine those
rights would lead to a protracted discu:.
sion, which might embrace in its failure
other more pressing matters, and the Executive
did not regard it as proper to
waive all the advantages of an honorable
adjustment of other difficulties of great
magnitude and importance, because this,
not so immediately pressing, stood in the
way. Although the difficulty referred to
may not for several years to come involve
the pence of the two countries, yet I -shall
not delay to urge on Great Britain the
importance of its early settlement. Nor
will other matters of commercial importancc
to the two countries be overlooked;
and 1 have good reason to believe that it
will compor^with the policy of England,
as.it docs with that of the United States,
to seize upon this moment, when most of
tho causes of irritation have passed away,
to cement the peace and amity of the two
countries by wisely removing ail grounds
of nrobahle future collision.
"** I
With the other Powers of Europe our
relation* continue on the mo*t amicable
footing. Treaties now existing with
them should be rigidly observed, and every
opportunity, compatible with the interests
of the United States, should be seized
upon to enlarge the basis of commercial
intercourse. Peaco with nil the world is
the true foundation of our policy, which
ean only be rendered permanent by the
practice of equal and impartial justice to
all. Our great desire should be to enter
only into that rivalry which looks to the
general good, in the cultivation of the sciences,
the enlargement of the field for the
exercise of the mechanical arts, and the
spread of commerce?that great civilizer

political interests of Europe, wo may be I
permitted to hope an equal exemption
from the interference of the European
Governments in what relates (o the States

it was regarded as me rigni or scarcu,
presented only in a new form, and expressed
in different words; and I therefore
felt it to he my duty distinctly to declare,
in my annual message to Congress, that
no such concession could be made, and
that the United States had both the will
and the ability to enforco their own laws,'
and to protect their, flag from being used
for purposes wholly forbidden by those
laws, and obnoxious to the moral censure
of the world. Taking the message as his
letter of instructions, our then iMinisterat
Paris felt himself required to assume the
same ground in a remonstrance which he
felt it to be his duty to present to M. Guizot,
and through him to the King of the
French, against what has been called the
Quintuple treaty ; and his conduct, in this
respect, met with the approval of this
Government. In close conformity with
these views the eighth article of the treaty
was framed, which provides thatu each
nation shall keep afloat in the African
seas a force not less than eighty guns, to
act separately and apart, under instruction*
from their respective Governments,
and for the enforcement of their respective
laws and obligations." From this it
will be seen that the ground assumed in
the message has bpen fully maintained, at
the same time that the stipulations of the
treaty of Ghent arc to be carried out in
good faith by the two countries, and that
all pretenco is removed for interference
with oar commerce for a*y purpose whatever
by a foreign Government. While,
thereforo, the United States have been
standipg up for the freedom of the seas,
they have not thought proper to make
that a pretext for avoiding n fulfilment of
their treaty stipulations, or a ground for
giving countenance to a trade reprobated
by our laws. A similar arrangement by
the other great Powers could not fail to
sweep from the ocean the slave trade,
without the interpolation of any new prin
ciple into the maritime code. We may
be permitted to hope that the examplo
thus set will bo followed by some, if not
all of them. We thereby also afford suit,
able protection to the fair trader in those
sens, thus fulfilling nt the same time the
dictates of a sound policy, and complying
with the claims of justice and humanity.
It would have furnished additional
cause for congratulation, if the treaty
could have embraced all subjects calculated
in future to lead to a misunderstanding
between the two Governments. . The
territory of the United States, commonly
called the Oregon Territory, lying on the
Pacific ocearif north of the 42d degree of
latitude, to a portion of which Great Britain
lays clnim,-begins to attract the attention
of our fellow-citizens, and the tide of
population whiclf-has reclaimed what wa9
so lately an unbroken wilderness, in more
contiguous regions, is preparing to flow
over thoso vast districts which strtech
from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific
ocean. In advance of (he acquitment
of individual rights to these lands* sound
.llMofoa flint pverv effort should be
together with copies ot letters on tne
same subject* addressed to the Diplomatic
corps at Mexico, by the American Minister
and the Mexican Secretary of State.
Mexico has thought proper to reciprocate
the Mission of the United Stalesjo that
Government, by accrediting to this a minister
of the same rank as that of the representative
of the United States in Mexico.
From the circumstances connected with
his mission, favorable results arc anticipated
from it. It is so obviously for the
interest of both countries as neighbors and
friends that all just causes of mutual dissatisfaction
should be removed, tnat it is
to be hoped neither will omit or delay the
employment of any practicable and honorable
means to accomplish that end. *
The affairs pending between this Government
and several others of the States
of this hemisphere, formerly under the dominion
o! Spain, have again within the
past year, been materially obstructed by
the military revolutions and conflicts in
those countries.
The ratifications of the Treaty-bet ween
ho United States and the Republic of
Ecuador, of the 13th of June, 1839, have
been exchanged, and'that instrument has
been duly promulgated on the part of this
Government. Copies are now communicated
to Congress with a view to enable
that body to mako such changes in the
laws applicable to our intercourse with
that Republic, as may be deemed requisite.
: ' ....
Provision has been made by the Government
of Chile for the payment of the
claim on account of the illegal detention
of the brig Warrior at Coquimbc, in 1820.
This Government has reason to expect
that other claims of our citfcen9 against
Chile, will bo hastened to a final and satisfactory
close.
The Empire of Brazil has not been
altogether exempt from those convulsions
which saconstantly afflict the neighboring
Republics. Disturbances which recently
broke out, arc, however, now understood
to be quieted. But theso occurrences,
by threatening the stability of the
Governments, or by causing incessant and
violent changes in them, or in the persons
who administer them, tend greatly to retard
provisions for a just indemnity for
losses and injuries suffered by individual
subjects or citizens of other Slates. The
Government of the United States will
feel it to be its duty, however, to consent
to no delay, not unavoidable, in making
satisfaction for wrongs and injuries sustained
by its own citizens. Many yoars
having in some cases elapsed, a decisive
und effectual course of proceeding will be
demanded of (he respective Governments

On the 23d of April last, the commissioners
on the part of the United States,
under the convention with the Mexican
Republic, of the 11th of April, 1839, made
to the proper department a final report in
relation to the proceedings of the commission.
From this it appears, that the total
amount awarded to the claimants by the
commissioners- and the umpire appointed
under that convention, was two millions
twenty-six thousand and seyenty-nine
dollars and sixty-eight cents. The arbiter
having considered that his functionswere
required by the convention to terminate
at the same time with those of the
commissioners, returned to the board, undecided
for want of time, claims which
hnrt Imnn nflnwprlhv lhe American COU1
missioners, to tho amount of pine hundred
and twenty.eight thousand six hundred
and twenty dollarsnnd eighty.eight cents.
Other claims, in which the amount sought
to be recovered was threo millions three
hundred and thirty-six thousand eight
hundred and thirty-seven dollars and five
cents, were submitted to the board too late
for its consideration. The minister of
the United States at Mexico, has been
duly authorized to make demand for the
payment of the awards according to the
terms of the convention, and the provisions
of tho act of Congress of the 12th
of June, 1840. He has also boen in.
structcd to communicate to that Government
the expectations of the Government
of tho United Statesln relation to those*
claims which were not disposed of according
to the provisions of the convention,
and all others, of citizens. t>f the United
States against the Mexican Government,.
He has also been furnished with other
instructions, to be followed by him in case
the Government of Mexico should not
find itself in a condition to make present
payment of the amount of the awards, in
specie or its equivalent.
1 am happy to be able to say that information
which is esteemed favorable,
both to a just satisfaction of the awards,
and a reasonable provision for other claims,
ihas been recently* received from Mr.
Thompson, the Minister of the United
States, who has promptly and efficiently
executed the instructions <*f his Government,
in regard to this important subject.
The citizens of the United States who
accompanied the late Texan expedition
to Santa Fe, and who were wrongfully
taken acd held as prisoners of wor in
Mexico, have all been liberated.
A correspondence has taken place be.
tween the Department of State and the
Mexican Minister of Foreign A flairs,
upon the complaint of Mexico that citi- j
zensofthe United States were permitted
to give aid to the inhabitants of Texas
in the war. existing between her and that
Republic. Copies of this correspondence
are herewith communicnted to Congress,

It is .to be hoped that a territory

speedily recover from the evils incident to -W ^
a protracted war, exhibiting, in tho increased
amount of ifcTrich productions, ? *3
true evidences of returning wealth and
prosperity. .
By the practice of rigid justice towards '
the numerous Indian tribes residing within
our. territorial limits, and the exercise
of a parental vigilance over their interests,
protecting them against fraud and
intrusion, and at the same t:mc using
every proper expedient to introduce among
them the arts of civilized life, we may
fondly hopo not only to wean theiu from
their love for war, but to inspire them
with a lovo for peace and all its avocations.
With several of the tribes great
progress.in civilizing them has already
been made. fc. Ttjo schoolmaster and the
missionary are found side by side, and

The balance in the Treasury on the 1st'
of January, (1842, exclusive of the
amount deposited with the States, Trust
Funds and Indemnities) was $230,483 08. The
receipts into the Treasury during
the three first quarters of the present *1 '''i? W
from all sources, amount to $26,616,59378;
,-of which more than fourteen millions
were received, from customs, and about
one million from the public lands. The
receipts for the fourth quarter are csti- |
mated at nearly eight millions ; of which
four millions are expected from Customs,
and three millions and a half from Loans^ .??j
and Treasury notes. The expenditures J
of the first three quarters of I he present
year exceed twenty .six millions t and"
those estimated for the fourth quarter
amount to about eight millions; and it is
anticipated there will be a deficiency of
half a million on the 1st of January next
?but that the amount of outstanding war-.
rants (estimated at 9800,000) will ieaVb
an-actual balance of about 9224,000 in
the Treasury. Among the expenditures
of the year, are more than eight millions
for the publie debt, and 9600,000 on ac- *
count of Iho distribution to the States of
tho proceeds of sales of the public lands.
The present tariff of duties was somewhat
hastily and hurriedly passed near

he surDrisimr to no one. To remedy
such defect's oa may be found to exist in
many of its numerous provisions .will net
fail to claim your serious attention. It
may well merit inquiry, whether the exaction
of alt duties in cash does not call for
the introduction of a system -which has
proved highly beneficial in .countries
where it has been adopted. I refer to the
warehousing system. The first and most
prominent effect which it would produce
would be to protect tho market aliko
against redundant or deficient supplies of
foreign fabrics?both of which, in tho
long run,*aro injurious as well to the manufacturer
as the importer. Tho quantity
of goods in store being at all times readily '
known, it would enable the importer, with nn
approach to accuracy, to ascertain the
actual wants of tho market, and to regu- ' **
late himself accordingly. If,howovcr, ho
should fall into'error, by importing .au '}
excess above pub'ic wants, he could rea?
d.ily correct its evils by availing himself
of the benefits and advantages of the systern
thus established. In the storehouse '
tiie goods imported would await the de*
mands of the market, and their issues
would bo governed by the fixed principles '
of demand and supply* Thus an approx- '
imation would be made to a steadiness
and uniformity of price, which, if attainaable,
would conduce to the decided advan
tago^of mercantile and mechanical
operations* .
The apprehension rftay. be well entertained
that, without something to ameliorate
the rigor of cash payments, the entire
import trade may fall into the bands of a
a few wealthy, capitalists in this country
and in Europe. Tho small importer, who
requires all the money he can raisolfor.in*
vestments abroad, and who can but ill
afford to pay the lowest duty, would havo
to subduct in advance n portion of his
funds in order to pay tho duties, and
would lose the interest upon th$ amount*
thus paid for all the time the goods might
remain unsold, which might absorb his
profits. Tho rich capitalist abroad, as
well as at homo, would thus possess, after
a short time, an almost exclusive monopo.
