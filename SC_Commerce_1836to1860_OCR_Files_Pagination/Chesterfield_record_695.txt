Mr. Editor :?
Though the subject here introduced to your
reader* may not awaken any general interest, yet,
as it is intended as much lor the good of the pub.
lie as to do justice to the individual whose name is
mentioned below, I apprehend you may be willing
to give it a place in your columns. So much good,
or harm, may result from the management of a
District Office, and it is so uncommon to find an
incumbent, whose thoughts arc wholly bent upon
the best interests of those who have placed him in
office, and who desires, in the discharge of his duties,
to build up a lasting reputation, that we may
be allowed, when we have found such a one, to
give him all that notoriety abroad that a newspaper
publication is susceptible oi. ^ c have such an
officer in the person of Capt. Joshua David, the
TArooont I lpilnmrr i if Murlhnrouirh District. To tile
the law, but can point out to the chapter and verse
upon which his opinion is predicated,?and when
a case is presented, to which no authority is directly
applicable, he has abundant resources, in a
jnind which is capable of arriving at just conclusions
by its own reasonings.
$
Or, do you want to examine any document in
his office ? In one minute it shall be in your hand
?or, if you will be satisfied with a transcript in
his books of Record, in half ? minute it shall be
laid before you, in a hand writing as legible as
the columns of a newspaper, and all this without
any hurry or confusion.
Or, do you wish to have the accounts of an administrator
examined, and your interest in the cs- I
tatc determined ? This also he will do for von ; ]
for he is not only a good accountant, hut is well J
acquainted with the judicial decisions which have
been made upon the subject. I
In a word, lie is familiar with the law appertain- i
ing to the business of his office; and an obliging J
disposition makes this knowledge the common j
property of every individual who desires to be benefitted
by it. In thus equipping himself for usefulness,
the profi*s of the cnterprize have constituted
a very small part of the inducement?a bccoming
pride of character, inspired him with a determination
to be worthy of the trust confided in him,
and to deserve the good opinion of all who can appreciate
the merits of a faithful officer. These arc
the considerations by which he is actuated, and he
has gained that reward wliieb is more valuable j
than dollars and cents?his merit is appreciated?
and when those pass away who are living witnesses
of his conduct and capacity as a public officer,
he will leave behind him an endearing monument
in the records of his office, in which postcri'y
may see the same character reflected, which
the present generation have accorded him.
But let not the reader suppose that the above is !
a studied panegyric, hewn out to gratify some pri.
vatc purpose of the writer?or that it has been j
strained, in order to furnish food for any vanity,
the individual mentioned may be supposed to have, j
The writer has nothing to ask from, nor does he owe (
hirn anything?and if he did, that individual is
not likely to be caught by such a bait. The above
remarks are made simply as a preface to some general
observations as to District officers, and the
reasons which should influence our choice in vot- j
ing for them.
The great maw of voters think but little on this*
subject, because they arc not aware of its importance.
Very tr'fling considerations frequently turn
the scale in favor of a candidate, who has no
claims whatever to the otlice he asks for. Hut, on
a little reflection, it will appear to be a matter of
very great iin]>ortancc to the people who is elected,
no matter what may be the oflicc which is to
be filled. Take, for instance, the sheriff's.?What
are his duties ? lie is the chief executive officer
of the law?(I say the chief, because more frc- I
quently called upon to carry out its requisitions.) J
And what is the law without sonic nnr. to nut it in .
force? It is nothing more than any other print- j
ed paper, and may be kicked about as contcmptu- !
misty a? the frogs did the log which Jupiter is said
to have lent them for a king ?it is as harmless as J
a log, unless an officer can be had to enforce the i i
penalties for infractions of it. Who is to arrest the
murderer?the thief?the robber?the trespasser I
upon your person, or those of your wives and
daughters?who to enforce the collection of the (
money whicii you have earned by the sweat of 1
, \ oyr brow?who is to make the laws tcrnDic to the j
evil-doer and a mantle of protection to the inno- j i
cent and helpless ? For, l*t it be remembered, that ; I
we have no other protection but the law?we have <
110 other security for our livf6 and property, but i
such as is furnished us by it?and what docs that <
I
amount to, w hen the officer who is to execute them j ?
is either incoinj?etent, or wilfully neglects, to per- <
form the duties of his office. That officer is the ; '
sheriff: he it is that guards the temple of justice : ?
that temple is our refuge from violence and op- I 8
predion ; and when he permits that sanctuary to i 8
be invaded with impunity, bv those who worship j 8
not there, our asylum is gone, and we are at once I f
in a state of nature, a prey to the fierce appetites c
of the lawless. These are results which do not r
follow cuddenly, but they are inevitable. Inch ' a
by inch the people lose their respect for the laws, I E
under a feeble administration of them ; and when ! c
tempted to insult or violate them, they will always I
do it when they have found it may be done with i T
impunity. Since the importance of the office of 1 i;
iSheriff, and the necessity of placing such individ- j c
uals in it as unite natural courage with moral firm- ! 'I
. I
nets?men who understand the spirit of our gov- 1 I
eminent, and who will execute the laws with an t]
eye to its preservation?men who arc accustomed
to the adjustment of complicated accounts, and ^
who will thus be able, as they should be willing, h
to give even* one his due?men who will not con- e
centrate all their thoughts upon f< cs, but will en- a
d-avor by their official conduct to establish a p
character for a firm and impartial discharge of j b
?
lovers of neatness and method in business, his office
is richly worthy of a visit. His pajnjrs are all
arranged with strict regard to the requisitions of
1839, and his books of Record exhibit a neatness
and correctness in the transcripts therein made,
which can be excelled no where. Do you wish to
know when he can be found in his office ? Examine
the act of 1839, and sec what that requires
of liim?that he shall keep his office open every
day in the month of January, (Sundays excepted,)
and on ever}* Monday and Friday during the remainder
of the year. If you desire to see him, you
will find him in his office precisely as required by
law?and you may go confidently, for you will be
certain to find him. And when you get there,
you will be certain to find an officer who is well
acquainted with the duties of his office?who has
employed much of his time in studying the law
relative to them?who does not simply echo what
he has heard professionally spoken by a limb of
UJXIIM'U 111 WUlAUIg 1U1 1110 UUI1 imv.viH, viiu jr.v- j
bability is very remote that he will do any better j
in working for others?if self cannot make him !
ply his oars, it is very doubtful whether the public |
good can excite within him any greater degree of j
activity. It is dilficult for a good citizen to be a
"good fellow"?for, being zealous for the public
interest, he will create many enemies among the
vicious and disorderly ; and the consequence will
be, that in the estimation of many he will be set
down as a " bad fellow." In fact, a man without
enemies is apt to be destitute of those virtues which
attach warm friends; and in all such cases, the 1
people would do better to let such candidates 6tay | i
at home and ruin themselves, rather than, by l i
placing them in public employments, give them ; <
the opportunity of injuring others. Public offices <
should be filled by men distinguished for their cji- j 1
ergy. 1 t
2d. "/ shall vote for Mr. A., because he is the , <
poorest of the candidates, and has a large family j 1
to support." Poveity is no positive disgrace any- I
where; but, in such a country as South Carolina, i
no man should make it a pica in iiis own behalf. ! f
What has the Cod of nature Withheld from 1 !
I
that with such a climate, and such a soil, an in. j i
dustrious, economical man should cry out, tniscri. 1
cordia !?should beg an office rather than place : t
hie claims to it upon the manly ground of his own j f
superior qualifications. The real truth of the mat- j c
ier is, that lazinesi is at the bottom of it, and the j s
candidate may be 6?eking otfice because he is too j f
lazy to work for his living. There are hundreds c
of respectable poor men in the country, who might
clamor for office on the same ground*, if they . s
would debase themselves so much as to do it; but , t
m the high tone of freemen, they prefer to eat their j fc
bread in honest and self-earned independence, than ! h
[o beg the luxuries of life at the hands of the public. v
N'o inan should be placed in office on that ground ; a
done; but, if it can be said for him that he has n
ill the requisite qualities for the office in a striking j r]
legrcc, then his pcuniary necessities may furnish 6j
in additional argument in his favor. Of them- c
selves, they arc not entitled to a moment's conidcration
; for a man who with good health, good I
oil, and good laws is so poor that he must beg for , h
m office, will always be poor, in cpitc of all his j tl
riends can do for him. The fact is, that a candi- p
late's condition in life has nothing to do with the tl
natter ! for we put a man in office to serve us, r(
nd not to serve himself: the question is, not how tl
nuch good we shall do to liim, but how much he j tc
an do to us, if elected. i c]
3d. "/ shall not rote for }Tr. B., because he is ! tc
ieh enough without the office." This argument j 13
i entitled to some weight where there are other I h,
an lidat'.s with the same aua'ifications. to whom I r'
t ' ""
he profits of the office would be more valuable. ]y
iut it is not fair to exclude a man from public Q1
rusts became he is rich?Ikb wealth is a guaran- m
5e to the public that he will do his duty, an lie has th
imething to lor-e if he docs not. Besides, where 6l
e has acquired it by his own industry, it ia an st
videncc that he has mind and energy ; and these pr
re two excellent qualifications for oifice. He has
tovrd that he knows how to take care of his own f0
udne.o, and you 111 ty be tiiUo a^uied that he will :i,
therefore be filled by men who would take no ad.
vantage if they had the opportunity?who are
morally honest?who will think of the good of the
country?who will have the moral firmness to do
their duty though they should lose popularity by it
| ?who are intelligent, and will enter ui>on the discharge
of their official duties with a determination
that they will profit the district as much as their
election to the office may profit them.
To the Ordinary is committed the care of estates
of deceased persons, and the widow and the orphan
look to him for protection. The proof of wills, by
which large estates are disposed of?the granting
of letters of administration?the appointment of j
guardians?the partition of small landed interests, I
j and the actual administration upon tb^sc estates
j not otherwise represented,?arc some of the princi;
pal objects of his jurisdiction. Is it important that
such matters as these should be well attended to ?
Is one man as capable as another of discharging !
these arduous duties ? Or, will it not require the
| highest order of intelligence, and of integrity ??
j An incumbent who is well qualified should be had,
let it cost wiiat it would ; for he can give the
| people very much of that instruction and advice
: which they would otherwise have to pay for, to a
class of the community sometimes known and
called by the uncharitable epithet of 44 necessary
evils." But commit these matters to an incompcj
tent or negligent officer, and in a few years he
will create more confusion than even the 44 ncccs- j
sary evils" can remove, without taking away a
goodly share of your estates.
Enough has been said as to the importance of
the offices of Ordinary, Sheriff", and Clerk : and
we shall now proceed to discuss some of the reasons
occassionally used in determining the choice
between the candidates.
1st. "He is a good fellow, and I believe / icill
vote for him, any how." A very intelligent farmer, '
to whom an overseer was recommended in that
language, (44 a good fellow,") replied, 44 You might '
h? well tell inc he is a d?d fool." It is very often
true, that a person who is neither good nor
bad, 44 hot nor cold," is entirely destitute of mental
energy, and more unfit for a public than a j
private employment. If he cannot distinguish \
1 ? -*i* 1? ??1.1 ? ? 1.1" A.itM infapiicl nm !
I their duty, having a just reference to the private
interests of the country at large.
Next in inipo.tance is the Clerk of the Court,
J ?whose greatest qualification for oftiec is somc,
times supposed to be, that of being able to write a
! good hand! This is a great mistake; for his
! hrad is the part for which the people will have the
I most use. He is the judge to decide upon the
ta ration of every bill of costs which the people may
have to pay?he is to see that they are not inq>osed
upon, and he should have the firmness to stand
up for them whenever his duty requires it.?The
Records in his ofticc are of vast importance?they
are evidences of debts due by one person to another?of
divisions made establishing the rights of
parties litigant?the peace and quiet of the District
depend u|>on their preservation. lie isa'so to enter
the rulis and orders of the court, keep a journal
of its proceedings; and very much depends
upon the correct discharge of his duties in these
particulars. .So, also, he is to copy all conveyan- j
ccs of land, marriage contracts, mortgages, into a
book kept for that puq>ose, which transcripts are to
l>e used to determine the rights of parties, in case
of the loss of the originals. There is not a paper
in his oifice, but is valuable to some one, and
should not only be taken care of, but in such a
manner that it can always be had when wanted.
The business of the people is most intimately connected
with the records in his carc, and they
should be as dear to him as the apple of his eve. I
Such an ollicc is therefore important, and should j
away 10 an unworuiy person, simpiy uc cause uc
has rendered us a favour of far less value ? an act
which it would be ungenerous in him to expect of
us, and base on our part to commit! A candidate
should not dare to say to you, that he cxpectri"your
vote because lie hut? done you a lavour: it is a
gross insult to any freeman to suppose that his
vote can be bought ; and to vote for such a reason
as that, is neither more nor less than selling your
vote.
6th. " Mr. E. has had the office, and I thin!;
somebody else ought to take it note." In other
words, lie has qualified himself, by one term's service,
for the more correct discharge of the duties of
his oliicc, and therefore he should be turned out!
?the agent has learned his duty more thoroughly,
and therefore must lie dismissed from employment!
This is like breaking a colt to the plough in crop
time, and taking him out as soon as he begins
to understand the business that you may have the
trouble and perplexity of breaking another, instead
of working the colt already taught his business.?
This argument proceeds from a misunderstanding
of the relation which the public stand in to an ofiie
r. He is not a mere beneficiary, to sit still and
have the fees of odicc poured into his lap, but he
is an agent?a servant?employed by the public to
render certain services, for which he is to receive
certain fees. Suppose we had to employ one for j
cur own private business; what would we look i
For ? We should expect him to be well qualified
:o act in the employment: we would not want a
:o!t which we should have to be breaking to the
larncss all the time we actually wanted his work.
S'o! we would select an agent .veil acquainted j
iviui jiir> uuoilftl'Bfe, uuu UIIU wjirj WOUiU IlxOVe alOlJg
steadily at his work without making us Buffer by j
M* blunders a:id mistakes. Should we do less ,
vrtbn wc arc selecting an agent for the public ??
His acts are as important to us in an official staion
as if he was in our immediate employment in
irivate busincw, and we should therefore be as j
ireumspect in selecting a public as a private
crvant. We pay him for his services, and wc
lave a right therefore to the very beet that the
:ountry affords.
The conclusion to be drawn from what has been
aid is, that the qualifications of a candidate for
lie office to which he aspires are all which should 1
>c considered in determining whether he shall
iuvc our votes. All other considerations are at
car with our duties as citizens, and our interests
6 individuals. A rote is a much more important
natter than is generally supposed : it is one of the
ivulets which swell the stream of national pro. .
perity, and if muddy in itself will stain the whole
urrrnt. Asa citizen of the State, every one should
o hie duty as if every thing depended on himself.
t is not enough for the soldier on the right that
e on the left should aim well his ball, for the bat.
e is to be won by every man's acting well his I I
art. The car of state is to be drawn along by J 1
it whole community, and he who lagG behind j j
>bs the country of his services, and is an unworly
heir of the great heritage left us by our ances. j |
>rs. We have good laws, a good soil, and a good j {
'imate?what more do we want than good officers c
> govern over us 1 And how are they to be had ? c
y weighing well the qualifications of candidates f'
jforc wc consent to place them in office; by dis- c
larging all other considerations, and electing on- r
such as arc calculated to promote the great ends j c
" our government. To this end every vote is J t
lost important; it is a blow struck for or against | p
ie country; and though the tree may not fa'l! c
iddenly when unnaturally smitten, yet the con. ^
ant gnawing of a tiny worm may effect that'
ostration which was proof against tome of the J ^
longest convulsions of nature. We do not fear j v
rcc?this we have prepared for ; but it is the in. 3
Lou: attrition cf the majesty of the laws, which j I
' understand how to manage yours. The manner
1 in which a man manages his own business, should
have much to do with his success as a candidate ;
for you may take it as an excellent general rule,
tint if he neglects his own business he will most
assuredly neglect yours. Go to his house?see
: how it is regulated?look at his fences, his crops,
h.s horses, &lc. : is every thing in first rate order?
?then you may rest satisfied he will keep your
business in precisely the same manner. If, on the
contrary, you find every thing in disorder, yon had
better let him alone,
i 1th. "/ cannot rote for Mr. C., for he is too
I proud to get my vote." If pride be a crime, it is
very difficult ol proof; for many persons have the
i appearance of it outwardly who are entirely inno1
cent of it in any improper degree. Every one
' should have a proper share of it, as it is a good
stimulus to praiseworthy actions; and when wc
j condemn a man for excess of it, the reason should
| be, because such excess renders him incapable of
j being a good officer. The reflecting citizen, in
casting his vote, should think very little about the
! manners of the candidate ; for we have nothing to
do with them after the election : the law prescribes
I his routine of duties, and if he will perform them it
j is all wc should ask. Tiiis pride which we some,
j times complain of will induce him to do that, as he
would fear the disgrace of not doing it. Indeed,
our " likes, or dislikes," should liave very little to
do with our votes ; for, in being led by our partial,
itics, wc lose the safer guide of our judgments,
and submit to be governed by caprice, rather than
the dictates of good sense. We want the offici r,
not the man: and he had better be too proud
than not enough so.
5th. "/ shall rote fur Mr. D., because he has
done me favours, and the other candidates have
not." The debt of gratitude should always be
paid ; but take care you are not bribed. Voting
is a privilege allowed you as a freeman ; but it is
not to be sold, or bartered for favors, past or pre.
sent. When we vote we do not vote for ourselves,
any more than wc would tire tor ourselves when
warring for the common enemies of the country.
In war wc fight for the public good, and in
peace we vote with the same view, that our rights,
as a people, may be for ever preserved. What
has .Mr. D.'s favours to do with the great common
cause 01 the country ? Which is most worthy of
preserving, his good will or the government which
protects us If the candidate is a good citizen,
he will not expect your vote on account of favours
rendered you, because this would be bribery ; bat
he might expect that you would return the favour,
not in votes, but in the kind in which it was rendered
to you. If you think it would be cheaper
to pay in votes, you arc mistaken, for it is not only
unpatriotic, but you are selling your birth-right for
a mess of pottage. There is no distinction in this
country between the governors and the governed :
wc are all sovereigns, and the privilege of voting
is what distinguishes us from those unhappy people
who arc lashed into obedience to oppressive
laws which they had no hand in making. Shall
wc deal so lightly with this treasure as to give it
! day, talking to Sheridan told him that a
man, that they hoth knew to be n confirm,
j ed miser, had subscribed a pound to some
public charity :?44 You mistake," replied
j Sheridan, 41 he never could do such a
| thing." 41 Why, I saw I.im do it," said
: Flood. 4> So did I too," ^aid Sheridan,
44 but 1 didn't believe it."

Agriculture is the foundation of all human
arts?the art for which man was made, and
the perfection of which is his chief happiness
| and glory as the lord temporal of this planet*
Of tins sublime art, all other arts and sciences
| are but satellites, their business being to wait
cn, enlighten, and adorn it with their moon,
shine. Consequently no man more than the
j agriculturist needs the full use of his brains,
and a perfect command of all the treasures of
j human experience. So the farmers of the
| United States view the matter; and in pre.
: senling them with a translation of the cele.
bratcd Maison Rustiquc, of the French, we
i have no doubt oftheir iiearty support. It ic

'farming. This is the source of her wci'th. <
England is rich by coals and commerce. Her
agriculture is'splendid, but sometimes costs
! more than it comes to. Those who have 1
fortunes to spend may buy the vast works of 1
Marshall, Dickson Arthur Young, Loudon, '

I wrote the best style and the best French '

farming, but us a means of educating his J
children. He was his own schoolmaster. In
winter evenings his family resolved itself into
a school, and he thus speaks of the use then
made of this work:? i
