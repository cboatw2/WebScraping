embarking in the Silk Ghltwre, and as tber. may

to give notice, that 1 will have some young
trees of the Chinese Mulberry to sell. . .
If adequate encouragement could bo expected,
1 could make arrangement# to supply a considerable
number annually, at the northern orioea. 1
could easily, during the winter of 1638, supply
from fifteen to twenty thousand, if I had knv <ufttaiety
of a demand for that number. Should any
one desirous of obtaining a supply, drop me a note
at this place, (Camden) it would soon come to
hand, at Longtown, Fairfield District, where 1
reside. A knowledge of the probable demand at
an early period would enable me to arrange my
plans ana operations to meet it i

THE success of the SOUTHERN TONIC is
unprecedented, it has been anxiously sought
after by all persons in every part of the United
States, and ltB widely extended distribution has
been owing to the many requests received from i
every section of the South and South West. Although
it originated in an obscure p.irt of the country
but a few years since, it is now found in all the
principal towns and villages in the Union, and its '
virtues as a cure for Ague and Fever, and as a
general Tonic, are appreciated by sit who have
nwd it Being as It professes a compound of
Southern Vegetables, it-is needless to ofler the assurance
that there is no Arsenic,Mercury, nor any
thing in the least hurtful to the human constitu- !
Hon in it. It will be found a valuable Medicine
in all cascsof Dyspepsia and disorganised Stomach,
and Bowelsl and patients convalescing from fcillious
Fever, will darive the most important benefits
from the use of,the Southern Tonici. It may
be administered to children and infants of the most

PATENT COTTON GIN.
THIS Gin can be made double, or single. If '
made double, they reduce labor, und gin just j
double, the quantity of cotton over the single cylinder
Gin, no other knd having been in use pievous
to this patent; and whether single or double, they
are found to improve the quality of the cottcu, by 1
more perfectly cleaning it. They can be mude to
contain from 60 to ICO saws in a stand, and whether
small or large, one hand will be sufficient to attend
tliem. The Gins have mechanical feeders and
hoppers attached to them, which free the cotton
from leaves, trash, dirt, &c before it can reach the
saws, and by the thorough hackling operation it
receives from the feeders, which make two revolutions
to one of the saws, it is almost in a half '
gined state, before it descends to the saw By a
very simple arrangement of a screw to each set of
gaates, on which the hoppers rest, and through
which the teeth of the feeders pass, they can be 1
made to teed slow or fast to suit the condition of
Lhe cotton at the time. When made double, the
raws are placed on two sets of cylinders and turn *
upon each other ift opposite directions, and are
cleansed by two sets ot brushes that have four revo- '
lutions to one of twe saw. The two cylinders can
be detached so as to enable the planter to Tim one
or both at pleasure, although embraced with feeders, '
&c. in one stand. The whole is put in operation
with a drum and band, as in the ordinary Gin, and
may be propelled by horse, steam, or water power. '
It may also be propelled by iron rhnning gear.
The force required to work it, is about the same as . '
that necessary to move an equal number of saws in j
the common Gin. This Uin has been put in '
operation in New Orleans for two or three weeks,
and its success tested in the presence of a large
number of planters, merchants and others, and f
received their general approbation 1
Several gentlemen have been so kind as to give 1
the Patentee their written opinion respecting the 1
merits of the Gin. A number of others could be
added, but the following are deemed sufficient: M

New Orleans, Feb. 527,1837. 1
Dr. A. Jones?Sir, In reply to your enquiry, '
what I think of yoyr improved Cotton Gin, I have
to say, that 1 saw it work on Saturday the 25th inst. 1
and was very much pleased with its performance. 1
The mere fact of its self-feeding, seems to rne to *
be a very valuable improvement; and besides, the (
quality of the cotton, as it comes out of the pro- 1
cess, appeared to me to be belter and ch-aner than |'
from the common Gins in Use, and that it saves 1
considerably in labor. Respectfully, &c. j1
