Whereas, the exigence of slavery in
our country must be considered a national
**al.??niiy, ns well as a great political evil:
And whereas, the admission o&tdavery within
tin* new States, or Territories of tht*
United Stales, is fraught with ilm most pernicious
consequences, and calculated to en_
danger the peace and prosperity of our
country. Therefore,"
4% Resolved, by the General Assembly ol
Ohio, that our Stumors mid Repicsentntivcs
in Congress be requested to us? their ut
most ex rtioiis to prevent the admission or
introduction of slavery into any ot the Territories
of the United States, or nny new
Siale that may hereafter be admitted into
the Union."
Tuc r por was ngp'ed to, without the
v**hs and nays liemg ordered.
The Chronicle and Sentinel next quotes
in proof of Gen. Harrison's opinions,
about this time, an extract from his language,
two years afterwards, when a
candidate for Congress, as follows:

the following interesting particulate in

0 Mr. Editor?I this morning paid ?
*' visit to this place situated about 4 miles
N. E. of Minersville, anil bv road 8
miles from Pottsvdle', to seethe uonder*
ful effects of a coal mine on fire Arri(y
ving at the foot of the mountain by the
J* Jateral railroad, I approached the mouth
' of the mine from which there issued con
siderable water, which to the trste, Is
1 highly charged with sulphur and some
iron corroded fom the^rails, laid in
he gangwayof the mine, and depositing
a sediment ai preaching near the color
of chromic yellow.
It was at this opening the fire took
place in January, 113H, caused by the
t. miners having made a fire in the mouth
i. of it to keep the w >ters from free* ng
-n a>K>ut the rails, so that they could com\%
in* nee their.operations early in the spring,
m which through carelessness ign ted
a# the.propping or the gangway, and from
f. which it camumnicated to the coal dirt
w before it was discovered, The miners
Its then endeavored to extinguish it, but it
was beyond their power, and after hav ?
ins wo Red at two nights and a day, they
r, left it in despair of stopping i * ravages,
lu and which it is now impossible to ?to,?
^ Going from thence up the mountain
n- (which laces the South) about 15b yards,
P(j 1 arrived at the first crater which is in
^ the shape of an inverted eliptical cone,
(]8 about 40 by 70 feet d ameter and suns
.some 15 feet below the surface, iu the
centre of which the cole vem. ?r miN
13 on fire, smouldering af it *ith
dint and stones which have caved in upon
it*the .stones are burnt to ii peartnci
like lime. Tlie smell of sulphur here fa
highly perceptible} from the North end
df*thfs crater there issues a rumbling
noise like distant thunder, and the heat
appears to be'intense. About t'O feot
higher up the mountain I arrived at *
another crater perhaps 30 feet indiata$?
ter, wlueb is a cKasm apparently about JR>
ft. deep with much smoke issuing from the
connection with the first crater on its
South; the West side of this chasm if a
ina-s of immense stone with fire underit
as for as the opening ex sM, the rurobltny
noise-before mentioned is here mare daa*
tinet than at-the H?st crater and the heat
gr at eh both caased'perhaps bj the wM
being from the South. The smo^e and
sulphur on theea?t side waevery iamaf*
ing to me, and caused me to alii ft my stir
nation to the west side, passing for ffet
purpose between the first and seeoijdofa*
>er over a strip of ground'about w fret
wide, knowing it to be undermined -bjffire
and then in full bla-t, caused me to
tread lightly, (such is ihe efiect of habit*)
for kar of breaking it down, which had it clone
l would have been engulfed into
a horrible death. ;
