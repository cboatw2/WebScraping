Cultivation or Corn.
The difference of opinion among farm- '
ers as to the best mode of cultivating '
f?trn. induced me some years ago, to give '
s??ine at tent" n to the subject. The rea- *
sons assigned, and the exj>ericnce of many '
of the best agriculturists, in favor of the I
^ system of level cultivation have convinced >
lue that our present mode is not the best,
and that it is susceptible of a decided |
change for the better. (
I ?m perfectly aware, that to question ,
the propriety of the prelusive vsp. of the
plough in the cultivation of corn will he ^
laughed at, and that to intimate that the
t* c
ridging of a corn held i- not t he most certain
mode of ensuring a good crop will be
denounced as mere "book farming" and *
hence entitled to no respect.
The present mode of cultivation is gen- *
erally, to burn off the stalks and stubble
that may lie upon the ground?to break f
up witli a slwbow furrow?plant the corn 4
withovt rolling or harrowing the ground 51
?then harrowing the corn while small* 1
and then by ploughing a? ofton as may 1
ho deemed necessary. In ploughing the '
corn, the prevailing and almost Universal y
rule is, to plough close lo the corn hills* *
Mo cut the fibres of the roots so as to in- *
crease and strengthen the stalks, as you cut r
the root# of trees hi an orchard by plough- r
itig, lo wake the tree grate vigorously ! / / f
? <? throw the earth high up on the [
stalks, ami to lay hy the crop bv plough- 1
mg tiiroe or four furrows between the ^
rows, that t e giound may be well ridg? r
((I, .vo as lo retain the moisture about the c
hi/is of corn! I J" > '
Too n\ -Jeui uf,culture, thut I believe 8
i- susieuiHulo l?y reason and experience* *
is the opposite of ail this. 1
I. If the ground intended to be cul- 1
tiiuth I in corn has a sod upon it, it should *
!** broken up ia tlie fall or winter prece- 51
ding, if the weather is suitable ; if not, it '
should he ploughed in February, or at t
^ least in the first week of March. It* not '
level ilsoouiiibe rolled, and if not mel. ,
low it should lie harrowed before plant- :
ing.
2. If stubble or com ground, no stul). (
Me nor stalks should l?c burned or remo. : '
ved, unless taken to the manure |>i/e? y
should Ik pi.airbed six inches deep, and '
it not iiH.iiovv should be harrowed. r
3. Wliiie small, the corn should he *
harrowed and the ground should l>e after- *
wards kept mellow and loose by the repeated
use of the cultivator. 1
4. On sod ground a plough should '
never be used in the cultivation of corn. ^
5. On other ground, the plough 1
should never bo used, after the roots have 1
extended any distance from the hills, and *
at no time unless indispensably necessa- 1
r\ to prevent the ground from baking.
6. The fibres or small roots of the '
corn should not lie cut; the cutting oil*of 1
every fibre depriving the stalk of a purl 1
of its nourishment. 1
7. The earth should not he thrown i '
- -? ?? ? I il.? ! I
"I' "" ",e Mills, as u jiiuiiuvh cut
til rowing out of additional spur roots, A , '
very slight portion of mould may he put [1
round the hill. '
8. The ground in the cultivation of '
corn should he kept as level as possible, I
to permit the roots to extend in every
direction and to retain moisture, llidg- 1
ing, cuts the roots?prevents the extern 4
sion of the surface roots beyond the mid- I
die of the rows?drains the water from '
the hills-?exposes more surface to the
action of the sun, and is therefore injuri- '
ous to a crop in a dry season. *
My own limited observation and expe- {
- ? *? - .?. e t
riencc, satisfy ine 01 mo correctness 01 the
above rules to be observed, in the '
cultivation of corn, and 1 now oiler the 1
opinions of the ablest and most practical
farmers in the United States to sustain '
the position I have assumed. ?
Judge Hue), who for good sense?for a '
thorough knowledge of the science of ag- I
riculture, for general intelligence?prac- 1
tical experience?and for a most exten- <
sive knowledge and familiarity with ^the 5
modes adopted by our agriculturists, was ]
unequalled by any man in the United
States, in speaking of the cultivation of '
this crop, expresses the following opin- {
ions: i
"The after culture consists in keep- i
ng ihe soil loose and free from weeds,
yhich is ordinarily accomplished by two
Iressiugs, and in thinning tiie plants,
vhich latter may be done the li st hoeing,
>r partially omitted till the last. The
>racticeof ploughing among corn, and of
uaking large lulls, is justly getting into
lisrepute: for the plough bruises and cuts
he loots of the plmts turns up the sod
ind manure to waste, and renders the
:rop more liable to suffer by drought.? 1
The first dressing should be performed as
;oon as the size of the plants will permit,
md the best implements to precede the
loe is a corn harrow, adapted to the J
ividfh of the rows, which every farmer
:an make. This will destroy most of the
veeds and pulverize the soil. The sec>nd
hoeing should he performed before or
is soon a9 the tassels appear, and may he
receded by the corn harrow, or a shallow
arrow of the plough, or what is better
;han either by the cultivator. A slight
;arthing is beneficial, providing the earth
is scraped from the surface, and t ie sod
ind manure not exposed. It will he
bund liencficial to run the harrow or cub
ivator a third, and even a fourth lime,
jetween the rows, to destroy weeds and
oosen the surface, particularly if the
11
season is dry. "
Some entertain a mistaken notion,
hat it is prejudicial to stir the soil among
:orn in dry weather, and others, that
vceds serve to present the evaporation of
noisture by a hot sun. The reverse of
hese opinions is true. The exhaustion
if moisture by a plant is in the ratio of
he surface of its leaves and stalks preented
to the sun and air."
"Indian corn.?There is no crop
vhich habit has rendered more indispensable
to the wants of our families and our
arms than this. The late John Taylor,
if Virginia, termed it our Mneat, meal
md manure.' Holding this high rank
n our farm economy, it is a subject of
nornent to adopt the best mode of culture,
\s many districts are shv in producing
vheat, and as this crop is seriously threat,
mod bv the now (to us) wheat insect, it
lecomes more a matter of solicitude to
ender our corn crops productive. But
is this grain demands more labor in its
mlture than other grain crops, so it is
nore important, on the score of profit, that
t should be well managed, for if thirty
lushels an acre be considered only a renuncrution
for the labor bestowed on the
:rop?all that the product falls short of
his must be a loss-and all that it exceeds,
i ncttgain on the cultivation. The first
lonsideration in regard to the corn crop,
s to give it a dry mellow soil; the second
hat this soil he rich, fat or fertile; and
he third, that the seed be timely put in
tnd t .ecrop well tak?*n care of. Neither
vet grounds, nor stilf clays, nor poor
rrounds, will repay by their product, and
nbnr required on a crop of corn. He
.vho has no other hut these, should not
it tempi to raise it as a field crop. Flo
oid hotter liesfow his la her upon other
lhjects, and buy his corn. We think the
jest preparation for corn is a clover ley,
veil covered with n long manure from the
iarn yard, well ploughed, and well harowed.
It is (tetter to give sixty loads
if dung to three acres than to ten, upon
he ordinary lands of our neighborhood.
F'he difference in product will not make
ip for the difference in Inhor. Corn can
lardlv he dunged too high. What we
lave to recommend, that is not common
n the culture of this crop, is, that double
he usual quantity of seed he applied?
he number of plants to be reduced at the
vecding?in order to insure three or four
ifalks in each hill; that the roots be not
nnr tlir? immure thrown fo the
MWrVf-ll) IIUI HIV IMMMU.Vf ....
surface hv the plough, hut that the har.
row and the cultivator he substituted for
it, which will sufficiently mellow the surface
und des!rev weeds, and that the hills
be but slightly earthed. By ploughing
md hilhng we conceive the manure is
wasted, the roots broken and bruised, and
irnited in their range for food, the crop
nore exposed to injury from drought, and
.lie lahor increased."
In speaking of the plough in the cultivation
of corn he again thus remarks?
We do not use it. We think its use
irejudicial in breaking the roots, and in
imiting their range for nutriment."
Mr. James M. Sutton, of St. George,
iu.-nrp_ who raised unon seventy-nine
icres 6,284 bushels of corn, and who
^ives an accurate and detailed account
>f the condition and cultivation of each
field, makes this remark in relation to the
jse of the plough :
"In order to attest the advantage of the
cultivator over the plough, for tilling
corn, he had five rows in this field that
he lapped the furrow to, with a plough,
previous to going over it the last time
with the cultivator. He soon discovered
that the growth of these five rows fell
diort, in height, of those adjacent, and
yielded one-fifth less corn.
"There is no doubt but that the true
mode of tilling corn, especially where sod
rround is used, is to plough deep, and use
nothing but the fallow and the flake har:ow
for its cultivation, Hy not disturb
i ingthe sod ploughed down, it remains/h
there as a reservoir^ of moisture, and an p
exhilating principle throughout the seas- a
on, to the growth of corn." ^
JAMES M. SUTTON. c
Upon Mr. Sutton's , report of his crop, ^
Judge Buel adds the following : tl
"Note.?The management which led
to the extraordinary product of corn,
should be deeply impressed upon the ^
mind of every corn grower. 1. The
ground was well dunged with long man- o;
ure; 2. It was planted on a grass ley, y
with one deep ploughing; 3. It was well 0
1--? 1 . 4- L. a K vfz-vur A Din t\
puiverizuu wiin mu uunun , -x. ?p
plough was not used in the after culture,
nor the corn hilled, Fbut the cultivator
only used ; 5. the sod was not disturbed,
nor the manure turned to the surface ; and
0. the corn was cut at the ground d
when it was fit to top. These are the ^
the points which we have repeatedly ur- *
ged in treating of the culture of this crop; "
and their correctness is put beyond ques- | ^
tion by this notable result. The value of
lime and marl are well illustrated in the ^
second experiment. (|
CONDUCTOR."
Mr. Chares H. Tomlinson, of Schenec- j
tady, New York, in giving an account of f,
his experience, says : fi
The two last years corn has been rais- c
ed in the following manner, on the Mo- w
hawk Flats, near this city. If in grass, s
the land is ploughed and well harrowed, ?
lengths iseof the furrow, without disturbing
the sward. The last season, the field c
was rolled after being planted, with evi- 11
dent benefit, as it made level. When the ?
. II
corn is three inches high, the cultivator is .
O ' # ||
passed through both ways; and twice
afterwards it is used in the same manner; a
no hilsare mn,de, but the ground is kept c
level. Neither hand-hoc, nor plough are ^
used, after the corn is planted. Fields I
manured with coarse manure have been v
tilled in the same manner. Corn tilled k
in this way is as clean of weeds, as when t
tilled in the usual wav : it is no more e
* - - . n
liable to be blown down, and the produce f
is equally good. It saves a great deal J1
of hard labor, which is an expensive item *
in the usual culture of corn. Last Octo. ^
l>cr, ten rods were measured out, in two
different places, in a corn field, or grass. t
land?the ono yielded ten, the other j,
nine, bushels of cars. In ono corn field, a
after the last dressing in July, timothy \
and clovcr-sced were sown, and in the o
fall the grass appeared to have taken ns h
well as it has done in adjoining fields v
where it has been sown with oats." e
Upon which Judge Buel again remarks: p
All, or nearly all, the acoounts we have
published of great products of Indian M
corn, agree in two particulars, viz ; in not
using the plough in the culture, and in 11
not earthing, or but very slightly, the hills. ^
These results go to demonstrate, that the
entire roots are essential to the vigor of ^
the crops, a"nd to enable them to perform (|
their functions as nature designed, must n
be near the surface. If the roots nrcsev- ti
ered with the plough, in dressing the y
crop, the plants arc deprived of a portion
of their nourishment; and if they are w
buried deep by drilling, the plant is par- ii
tially exhausted in throwing out a new o
set near the surface, where alone they can
l>erfcrm all their offices. There is an- a
other material advantage in this mode of f
cultivating the corn crop?it saves a vast 11
deal of manual labor."
c
The preceding considerations justify ^
us in recommending, that in the manage p(
ment of the Indian corn crop, the follow. M
ing rules he observed, or at least partial- a
Iv, so far as to test their correctness : n
1. That tfic com harrow and cultivator fi
he substituted for the plough in the culture h
of the crop. S|
2. That the plants be no not hilled* or n
but slightly so?this not to prevent the I
soil being often stirred and kept clean* ^
and, ^
3. That in harvesting, the crcp be cut a
at the ground as soon as the grain is gla- e
zed.
Again, in refercnec to the system of a
level cultivation of corn, Judge Bucl re- w
marks: . "
44 The experience of the last two years
has been sufficient to admonish us, that ?.
without due precaution, our crops of In- 8
dian corn wilj not pay for the labor be- 0
stowed on the culture ; and yet, that Sl
where due attentien has been paid to soil,
manure, seed and harvesting, the return
has been bountiful, notwithstanding bad s<
seasons. Having been uniformly sue- a
cessful in the culture of this crop, we feel t(
justified in repeating some leading direc- .
tions for its management." J.
"After-culture.?Jn this the plough
should not be used if the corn harrow and *
cultivater can be had and if used, should
not be suffered to penetrate the soil more Sl
than two or three inches. The plough j a
tears the roots, turns up and wastes the i "
manure, and increases the injuries of j
drought- The main object is to extir- ?
pate weeds, and'to keep the surface mel-;
low and open, that the heat, air and mais- j "
ture may exert better their kind influences e<
upon the vegctuble matter in the soil, in "
converting it into nutriment for the crop. "
At the first dressing with the hand hoe, ?l
the plants reduced to four, or three, in a ^
ill, the surface is broken among the | <
lants, the weeds carefully extirpated, <
nd a little fr&sh mould gathered to the
ill. At the second dressing, a like proess
is observed, taking care that the
arthing shall not exceed one inch and a i
alf, that the hill be broad and flat, and <
lat the earth for this purpose be not tak- |
n from one place, but gathered from the 1
irfiice between the rows, where it has <
een loosened by the cultivator." *
As an evidence of the practical results 1
f this mode of cultivating corn, I give '
ou, in addition, the statements of two 1
the1" farmers of their mode, and of the 1
roducts of their laud. i

aund from measurement from the barrel 1
ine bushels and seven-eighths of shelled
orn. The following is the manner in !
rhich I prepared the ground, &c. The
011 is a stiff clay ; one and a half acres
f said lot was in clover last year, the 1
alance in wheat. I put 205 two-horse
art loads of ham-yard manure on it: the
aanurc was coarse, made out of straw,
orn tops and husks hauled into the yard
a January and February, and hauled out
n March and April, consequently was
ery little rotted. 1 spread it regularly
nd ploughed it down with a large conlave
plough, (made by G. Cox, of Midilctown,
Delaware.) seven inches deep,
then harrowed it twice the same way it
ras ploughed. I then had the rows marked
oat with a small plough, three feet
en inches wide, and one and a half inchs
deep. I planted my corn from 18 to
12 inches apart, and covered it with hoes:
list drawing the furrows over the corn,
vhich covered it one and a half inches
clow the surface. When the corn was
our inches high I harrowed it, and thinted
it to two stalks in the hill; in about
wo weeks after harrowing, I cultivated
tiahout the 5th of June I cultivated it
gain, which was all the tillage I gave it.
Ve farmers of the Eastern Shore count
ur corn by the thousand : I had 28,640
ills on my lot, and I think my corn
rould have been better had I planted
arlier : I did not plant till the last of Aril.

inch the best way, especially on clover |
sy. Is you think the above worthy of

soil for wheat.
Wheat will not thrive, whore there is
10 lime in the soil. It may he artificially
tpplied to soils destitute of it, and a lolera
lie crop will bo inainainod, but this is
rorcing things to quite t?>o great an expense.
Thirty years ago, wo never saw
i wheat stalk growing in the Old Colony.
There is no lime in the soil of that region.
Since it has been discovered that lime is
indispensable for wheat, many of the farmers,
in that region, purchase Thomnslon
lime, sow it broad east on their field designed
for wheat, mix it with the earth j
by plowing and harrowing, arid in this
way obtain a great rarify?a tolerable i
crop of wheat. But the application of
lime, as well as of manure, must be rencwed
annually, or no wheat kernels will
fill out. We recollect that in September.
1837, we were in the town of.l/hrshfield,
Mass., and had the curiosity, whilst there,
to visit the principal-farm of [Ion. Daniel
Webstor, once the old (?ov. Winslow
homestead. As we approached the mansion,
passing down the avenue to the
house, we noticed a " large pawed" man
on our left, with a slouched hat and canvass
or tow cloth frock on, marching first
this way and then that, with a half hushel
measure under his left arm. and with
his right scattering air slacked luno over
the greund, till it appeared quite white.
We paused for it few moments to chat
with the old codger, as to the operalion
he was engaged in, and to inquire if Mr.
Webster was at home. It was Mr. Webster
himself. Ho was preparing his field for
wheat. He was very anxious to raise
wheat and make Graham bread of it; and
in this way he had met with soma success.
Our soil in Maine is generally of a limestone,
formation, and therefore is naturally
adapted to the growth of wheat.?
We need not to scatter lime on our ticlds.
Rut there are soils of different consistency,
some of which are more favorable to the
growth of wheat than others. We find it
statedin the Memoirs of the New York
Board of Agriculture, that " wheat grows
better on land that contains just as much
clay as can he combined with it, without
subjecting the wheat to be frozen out."
We inquired two weeks ago, whether
the danger of frost to winter wheat, even
in our latitude, is greater on well selected
locations, Than the danger of spring sown
wheat, frcm the weevil, rust, mildew
In our opinion thero should be more attention
given to the cultivation of winter
This is in hazard from nothing but the
frost, and when itsucccceds, it makes n
better grain and a whiter flour. The location
should not be in a low place, where
the water will stand, but some elevated
or sfde-hill situation, where the land is
dry, and if it is where the snows naturally
drift, in, so much the butter. The
author of (he Memoir-above alluded to.
observes?" Since it is the clav which
absorbs and retains most of the water in. j
jurious in wheat soils, I adopted a rule j
for the consideration of farmers, founded
on that principle, and confirmed by all the
observations I have been enabled to
make." His Rale is as follows : "Wash
a little of the soil in a tumbler of wafer,
and observe the time required for it to become
clear. If the time required exceeds
three hours, it may be considered that in
such a soil, the wheat is liable to he in.
jured by frost." This is a simple Rule,
easily applied by any farmer, who chooses
to make the right selection of land for
winter wheat.
Wheat that is sown the latter part of
August or early ia September, will have
:imc to extend its roots in the soil, and
will stand a better chance to retain its
told as the soil " heaves under the operai
n n r\f frrwf
In relation to the depth the seed should
>e covered, Mr. Featherstanhaugh, in his
tissay on the Principles and Practices of
tiural Economy, says :
4* A grain of wheat when put into the
'round at the depth of three inches, unlergoes
the following transformations as
loon as the farinaceous matter which enrelopes
the frame of the young plant conaincd
within it is softened into a milky
itate, a germ is pusod out, and ut the
>ottom of that germ small roots soon folow.
The roots are gathering strength,

VllllSt tnegcmi, oy IUO am vi wiv III..KJ
iuid, is shooting upwards; and when the
nilk is exhausted, the roots arc in activi.
y, and are collecting nouiishment for the
>lant from the soil itself. This is analagnis
to the weaning of the young of aninak
which are not abandoned by the
nothcr till they can provide for themselvis.
But the care of nature does not end
icre ; when the germ has fairly got above
tho surface, and become a plant, a set of
Upper roots are thrown out, close to the
surface ofthe ground, which search alt
the superficial parts of the soil with the
same activity as the under roots search
the lower parts; and that part of the
germ which separates the two sets of roots
is now become a channel, through which,
the lower roots supply the plants with the,/
nourishment they have collected.
What an admirable contrivance to ?Bcure
the prosperity of the plants? Two
^istinct sets of roots serve, in the first
place, to fix the plant firmly in the ground,

I We were informed'a few days since by
Mr. Williams, of Wallingford, that he
purchased in Mnv last, thirteen Sheep,
each of which bore a lamb in Deceml>er
or January last, eleven of which Iambi
came to maturity for the knife, and were
butchered by him. In June, eleven of
?be same sheep again bore twelve Iambi,
nil of which are now living. We believe
instances have been known of sheep hear*

WHY WILL MILLS GRIM) Bt>RK tl* THE
WIGHT NH AN IN THE DAY-TIXK ?
It is known to every miller, says a
modern who argues phiiosiphtc&l, that the
valocity of water wheels is increased at
the approach of night withou t the volume
of water or aperture through which it
passes being enlarged. The solution of
this well-known and singular fact is found
in two distinct causes.?Water-wheels
generally, are impelled by the specific
gravity of water*?The specific gravity
of water, in some measure depends on its
tem|>ernture ; for instance, say Water at
GO dog. weighs 61 pounds per cubic Foot,
while at 40 dogs, it weighs 62 pounds.
Supposing the temperature of water during
the day to be 60 degu. and |40 degs.
nt night, it follows that the specific gravity
of water used at night, is 1-6*2 greater
than the water used during the day, consequently,
the power, impelling waterwheels,
is 1-62 greater at night than day,
the aperture through which the icater issues
heing the same. The volume of wator
expended in a given time is the same nt
night as in day, but the weight of water
consumed is greater at night than in day
caused by the greater density of water at
night. *
The second cause producing this singular
fact alluded to is, that at the approach
of night, the vapours suspended
hi the upper regions of the atmosphere
during the day, descend and rest oil
the surface of the water in forehays of
mills, and aid their weight and density in
forcing an increased quantity of water

the specific gravity between cold atinoa
phere charged with vapour, and air heated
by the noonday sun, is the pressure added
at night to water in forebays of mills. ^
Tiie Bankrupt Law.?This law see ma
to be misapprehended by many ; and the
attempts of some of our contemporaries
to set the public right on tbo subject hava
not been very successful.
If we understand the provisions of the
law correctly, the persons who come under
its operations are divided into two*
flatwos. mlnnt/irv and involun/orv.
In the class of voluntary Baxkrupts,
are included "<vZ/ persons whatsoever?
rich or poor, merchant, trader, mechanic
farmer, laborer, &c. without any reference
whatever to the amount of their indebtedness,
provided their debts shall not
have been created by a defalcation as a
officer or, as cxecu'or, administrate, guardian,
trustee, or while acting in any other
fiduciary capacity. Such defaulters cannut
have the benefit of the law at ail.
In the class of involuntary Bankrupt
are included all" persons being merchants
or using the trade of merchandise, all retails
of merchandise, and all bankers, factors,
brokers, underwriters, or marine insures,
owing debts to the amount of not less
than two thousand dollars," who shall leave
the state w.th the intent to defraud their
creditors, o shall take any other measures
to nccomphsh such a design.
