If the malignity of the human heart be
exhibited in one manner, more strikingly
than in another, it is in the unhallowed
resentment of injuries Let us not be
understood, as referring to tlie'condUct of
the individuals, who fly to the sanctuary
of justice, for refuge from those who
wantonly assail the purity o'f their intentions,
^Snd *ully with their tarnishing
breath, thai richeflst Of fell property?refutation.
We allude to 'the practice of
duelling?a practice, whii'h has torn from
society, some of its brightest ornaments,
and robed many a family in the drapery
of mourning: a practice that originated in
unsound views of honor, and has been
supported by false pride.
wnat can t?e ottered to palliate bo monstrous
a crime? What principle of nature,
whai decisihn 6f correct reason, or
what doctrine of revelation, ran the duellist
adduce, in extenuatinh of his guilt?
if he appeal to the tribunal of nature, he
will find, that her sentence is, that no
passion should be indulged In, that has
the suffering of others for its express object.
If he listen to the voice, which
sounds forth from the throne, which the
?eity has erected within, he will liear
liis condemnation. If he consult the oracle
of revelation, that "more sure word
of prophesy.'* he will meet with a corroboration
of this fact and be impelled
to the conclusion, that resentment ill-be'comes
those who derive all present j"ys
and all future hopes from mercy.
Must not the iustitutors of this law of
'honor, have had very imperfect ideas of
true dignity? Did they not place too
light a value oh Usefulness, relationship
.?.i i:>~ -L- "
ami me, wucii, in me sagvnefs 01 meir

lation? We love honor. ^V'e believe,
that it is Aot only a source of pleasure,
to its possessor, but that it also diffuses
around his character, an atmosphere, in
which confidence may live and friendship
*?move and have its being," but that mistaken
quality, which prompts to unholy
. deeds?which urges him, in whom it !
dwells, to repair to the duel ground and
attempt to destroy his fellow's existence,
we look upon, with disgufet and horror.
In whatever light, we contemplate di!i- 1
elling, we perceive its absurdity. Let it '
be viewed, as the resort of an injured '
character to obtain reparation, and what '
importance or usefulness, can be attach- 1
ed to it? If neither the Sovereign Of the 1
Universe, nor the civil constitution has 1
made provisions for the recovery of a
wonnded reputation, we contend; that rid
man has a right to fly to So shocking a 1
custom for redresft Better far, would it '
be for himself, his farhily and his country 1
if we would pass through life, With a set- j
tied disgrace upon his name, ratheir tliari i
murder his brother, to perpetuate his res- '
pectabilily. Where duelling kept up for '
good purposes, did it prevent any harm
from resulting to the world or did it draw
into exercise the manly and Virtuous dis- 1
positions of the heart, we might be in- J1
ciuieu u? iook upon ir, witn more Favor,
but believing, that depravity is its parent
and sorrow and woe-, its saddening con- '
sequences, we cannot but raise our voice !
in its opposition and pray Heaven, that
ere long, this deep Stain may be wiped 1
away from the World:
These rertiarks have bebn made by way 1
of introduction to the narrative, which I
am now about to give. Should it be destitute
of incident, we hope that it will
not be, without moral power.
Many years have rolled Away, Since
accident threw me, into one of those
valleys, Which are formed by the irregular
ridges bf the lofty Alleghany. During
my transient et&y in that region of fertility
and beauty, I formed a Considerable
acquaintance WUb twd young persons
who were nighly esteemed for the intelligence
ol their miii<ls~? the amiability ofi
their hearts and tho correctness of their i
denorlment.
Robert and Gustavas were, certainly
Uncommon youths. Born in the vicinity
of each other, they hail early contracted
an ardent attachment. Ere the corruptions
of earth had Stolen into their hearts
they had given to one another, the upper-most
seat in their affection. The highest
bliss they knew, was to aport together,
on the same spreading lawn, or roafo together,
over the same fields. Discovering
their remarkable fondness for each
other's society, the parents of Robert
aud Gustavas, did all in their power to
continue and confirm their mutual regard.
When their boyhood had expanded into
youth, they were placed in the same
academy, where, fcfter a quick passage
through the preparatory studies, they
irere sent to one of our most respectable
college^. Amid so many other associates
jibey here retained their deep love for
eace other, which hfed been their constant
characteristic, in the hours off ehildhood.
They drank froth the same fountain of
science. Led by the hhnds of their Poets,
they wandered back into ages past
and conversed with men and things
?.i j mi ? . ^ I -
ui w?ncr usyi. Aiicy wuneaseu me
brave exploits of ancient chivalry?heard
the thundering eloquence of olden time,
rousing the inactive and animating the
noble to heroic effort, ahd listened with
enraptured hearts, to the soft numbers
of the lyric bards. Reaping here no
small harvest of honor, they returned to
their homes,?the delight of their parents
and the pride of their friends.
They were now separated for a few
months?few in reality, but many, seemingly
to the parted friends. Upon the
business of his father, Robert was sent
away, but, transacting it as speedily as
possible, he again enjoyed the company
of Gustavas. If their love admitted of
increase, it was surely augmented by tneir
temporary disuuion, for who does not
know, that rewoval from a friend has an
aslohishing tendency to make the fibres
of the lie rat draw stiU 'closer amend him!
When business has taken us from home
for a time, have we not come back to its
sweet bosom, with an enlarged affection
for the mother, who illumined it, with her
smile, and the fond falhet and sister, who
gave it its magnetic power?.
Verging rapidly towards manhood, the
two associates began to think of their future
course. With the approbation of
their relatives, they determined t6 enter
the Navy. Their uncurbed imaginations
had often thrown the highest attractions
around a Sea-fairing life, and hence, it is
not strange that they made it their choice.
Upon the arrival of the tiine for their departure,
they went forth from the scenes
of their lift's happy innocence, knd directed
their course towarns the distant seaport.
Their moistened eyes and sad tones
betokened, that to them, "there was no
place like home." When the descending
sun numbered the flight of the sixth day
since their absence from home, the two
friends came in sight of the place of their
destination. In a short time, the gallant
ship had unfurled her sails and turned her
head towards the ocean.
If thou hast never, dear reader, been
on a voyage to sea, thou little knowest
the feelings, which arise in the heart of
him, who, borne along by the swiftly sailing
vessel, sees the hill-tops of his native
land gradually sink from the vision and
the wide waters open before him. When
the heavy hand of Death presses on the
eye-lids, is it painful to utter the last adieu?
Not much less distressing ?te the emotions
of the sailor, when he fixes his eye, in
sad contemplation upon the diminishing
spires of the forsakep harbor, for he has
no assurance, that e'er again they shall
greet his vision or cheer his spirit. Th?
repose of sleep is not more like the repose
of the grave than is the agony of a
temporary, uncertain separation, to the
emotions which are awakend by the utterance
of the final farewell. So it was with
Robert and Gustavas. In leaving their
kindred and home, they felt as if they
wepe removing from all that gave lile its
charms.
Their fcrui&e continued several years.?
Novel as it was to the two friends, they

i' ?r m\? m m ?v uvi I w OVIII^ I'ICQOUl C
from it.- During the whole voyage their
mutual esteem flourished in undiminished
vigor. They were seldom oUt of each
other's sight. When the daik 'clouds taht
held in their ample folds, the gathered
tempest, spread their dun banners o'er the
ship?when the waters above appeared to
mingle with the waters beneath,they stood
Bide by side, in all their riatiVe intrepidity,
and looked unmoved upon thfe awful scene
And when natuie's calm was restored
and the sun looked down upon the placid
waters, they would sit together and
talk of the endearments of home. Upon
the termination of their vovaire: thev visi-;
? O ? /
ted their relatives, and in their pleasant
society forgot the dangers to which they
had been exposed, and the trials through
which they had paised.
And here, in the progress of our narration,
it becomes our duty to mention an unhappy
rupture, which took place between the two |
associates. What small causes produce
mighty effects. Whether we look at natural
or moral operations, wc discover the truth of
(his fact. The towering oak, that wrestles
with the sweeping hurricane was once, an
insignificant shrub, that might easily have
been destrbyed. The little rill that murmurs
along the mountain's base, becomes at
a distance, a m ghty river, bearing uport its
broad surface, the contributions of commerce
And in the political world, how many kingdoms
have had their glory extinguished?
how many thrones have been made to crumble
ank how many sceptres have been wrested
from the hands of monarchs, merely by
the plans of a single individual! Bui more
%
particularly, in matters of friendship, simple,
things produce vast consequences. How ofr!.
ten has the silent expression of ifee eye or
the tone of the voice, severed unions, hallowed
by affection ahd rendered strong by time!
How frequently has a peculiar look or word
undone the work Of years!
Will the reader believe me, when I inform
him, that thus it was with these interesting
companion*! They had been present at
a ball. Participating in the light dance and
enjoying the gay amusements of theeVqnihg,
they had pleasantly passed their time. Upon
the close of the festivities, Robert in his usual
gentlemanly manner, kindly offered to
attend a certain lady borne. This act wad
contrary to the Wl-?he* and request of Gust avas,
who, blinded by false hotionfc, imagined
himself to be greviously insulted. Here
was the beginning of their difference. Small
indeed, it was, hut, however, trifling, when
a commencement of this character has been
made, whose vision is so acute, as to foresee
its termination?
Perceiving the change in the manners of
Gustavas, I'obert had an interview with him
and in his amiable way, offered an apology.
Upon the most ferocious tempers, mildness
will have some influence. It exalts over the
mind, the same power, that sedatives do over
the body. "A soft answer turneth away
Wrath."
Although Gustavas appeared to forged ihe
uuuuubi ui ma menu, yei ne uiu not ao so,
in reality. His countenance would sometimes
wear its former smHe, and his tongue
would now and then profess some respect,
but in his soul there was enmity. His passions
only slept? they were not dead. The
"roots of bitterness" were there, waiting fbr
circumstances to give them, a developement.
Unrivalled by Robert, Gustavas had hoped
to sectfre the regard of Miss B. and consequently.
when, he understood, that she and
his old companion had corresponded on the
subject of niairiYhony, his unrestrained dispositions
broke through all bounds and manifested
themselves in deep adversion to Robert.
His anger grew fiercer and fiercer,
until the report of Robert's intended marriage,
raised it to its highest pitch. What
an unfortunate quality is an irritable temper!
How miserable does it fnake its possessor
and what disorder and trouble does it introduce
into families! Heedless of consequences-and
seeking, at eVery hazard, its own
gratification, it rushes on, like the tqountain
torrent, impatient to readh its end.
Under the influence of this mental phrenzy,
GustaVas, losing sight of all the devotion
of btlier years, determined on revenge, arid
hastily seizing a pen wrote Robert a challenge.
Wh'eri the note was received, who cdri por
tray the feelings, which it excited! . Robert
could ndt credit it. 'As he Walked the floor
and pondered the strange occurrence in his
mind, he asked himself: "Can it be so. Is
this menacing, insulting lariguage from my
former friend.'"
He doribted for a moment, but drawing
from his pocket-book, a friendly letter, which
Gustavas had writen, in happier days, he
compared the hands and lo! they were the
same. "Alas!" exclaimed he. "I can hesitate
to believe no longer. This challenge is
froiri hitr.. Deluded man! Is he in his
serises?"
Without tK?? least delay, Robert repaired
trt itio ftuinll'ina Af - -? ? '-?
w ins uuviiiu^ ui uuBiavas, miu enaeavoreo
to expostulate with him But all that he
said and done, had but little effect upon him.
"And must we fight u* asked Robert, as
he turned to leave him. "Must wo, who
like two shrubs, twined around each other,
must we engage in this horrid conflict?*'
i "We must," replied Gustatas, in a furious
'passion. "Why this reluctance on your part
to settle a dispute in an honorable manner!"
Honorable/' exclaimed bobert, "Pray,
where did ^ou gat so strange a diffnition of
honor? Such a practice, c6m{k>rts not with
my notions of Honor."
, "I will persist in hiy cottrse. You have
degraded me. Who does not taunt me,
with their repsoaches? The world laQgh at
me and call mu a vanquished tool. I will
He revenged?"
Withdrawing from the presence of the
raging Ousiavas, in a slow step and, meditating
mood, Robert retired to his residence.
The solemnity of the hight and the sad scene
which he had beheld, combined to make him
feel, in a peculiar manner. **How cart 1
fight!" asked he. **Wa& it not the last
charge of my dying father that I shohld never
fight?" , Memory told him it was, and as
she wakened the parting scene from the oblivion
into which 'l ime had plunged it, he
fancied that he heard again the same low,
tremulous voice whispering?"never fight a
duel."
But the world?the world?Whdt would
the world think of him! Engaged in these
reflections, he reached his abode, and hastening
to his chamber, flung himself upon his
bed, not to rest bUt to think.
Unrefreshed, Robt lose early in the mottling,
with a clouded brow and heavy heart,
and ere the* arrival of the breakfast hour, his
mind was made op; to fight. No way of relief
presented itself, and hence, he formed
the unwise conclusion to risk his existence
for the gratification; hot of himself, but of
the evil wishes of his antagonist.
That night, Robert spent at the house of
his beflirothed. An engagement had taken

period fised for their marriage waa rapidly
approaching. Though he had a present!- i
ment that he should Tall, he exerted all his' l
philosophy to divert himself of the gloom, t
which had crept over him. When he was
about to go Troth heV presence, he took from I
his bosom, a small gift a fid requested her to )
keep it for his sake. For the last time, he r
beheld her countenance?for the last time, (
he heavd the mellow tones of her voice, and <
parting in the usual manner, he walked to- e
wards his mother's, almost oppressed to the j
earrti on which he trod. c
The afterpoou for the duel arrived. At f
the kppo'inted' hour, the parties were on the 11
I ground. The distance Was measured, and i
' the preliminaries settled. The two young *
jmefttltatfS up and at 'the word fired! Wh6 '
fell? The accomplished, amiable Robert v
left, another mournful victim to the horrible |t
j custom of authorized murder, fntelftgence! 1
, worth end virtue were offered up at the altar p
of this modern moloch, a rich sacrifice, that s
should have been given in a more useful atid s
holy cause. v
What pale and agitated form is that, Which
so hastily approaches the fatal spot? And
what more slehder and beautiful one is that .
following inhits rear? They are the mother
and sister of Robert. Why so mtich uneasi- v
ness and anxiety depicted in their counte- 1
nances? They have heard ihat Robert was j0
about to fight *Mid they have come in pursuit:^
of him. Hark! hearest thoU that long deep
wail of sorrow? See'st (hob those passionate
exhibitions of anguish ? They had heard
the woful tidings?they have seen the dreadful
sight. Ah, mother! ah sister! you are s
too late. He has gone. Your prop, your v
comfort, your hope is ho more. Bereft of b
r Ai? m ??Lk. 1
juui ^icoicsi furniiy soiace, you must go I
down to the toiftb, with a heavy burden of 0
distress, upon your hearts. 1
Most deeply, did the community sympa- n
thize wifh the mother and sister of the un-|a
fdrtunute youth. But they found that no 11
consolation, no solace could restore theirj ?
lost joys. Secluded from the World, they i
spent their few remaining days in the service
of God, and when the last summOns came, ?
they without a regret, laid down their lives, J'
in hopes of a blessed resurfecfion. . , 6
What became of Miss B-i ? She did 6
not long survive her friend and lover. W ith c
true female fortitude, she, for a while, sup- !
ported herself, but her spirit, in, the end,
lost itfe elasticity and sunk beneath severe ,
pressure. J
In a conspicuous place, Robert was interred.
A plain monument, erected by the
inhabitants of the vicinity, told the stranger e
Ins name, character and family, while in the .r
hearts of his numerous acquaintance, his 11
memory was enshrined and his name writ- 11
ten. Often did the aged lead the rising
generation to the grave of Robert, and as
their hands dressed the flowers that shed
their fragrance around the spot, their voices v
would repeat and enforce the lesson of 5
Robert's expiring father?" Never'fight a 0
duel!" ' y

the lamented Robert, when, called by bust- ^
ness, 1 again visited the western part of Vir- a
ginia. 11
Stopping for rest, in a small town, I was e
inddced by curiosity to go to the court, then
sitting in the place. I soon perceived that1
a case of unusual interest was under consid- a
era>ion. On turning my eyes towards the 11
bar, what was my surprise, when I recog- ?
nised in the prisoner; Guatavas ! In 1
the progress of the trial; 1 found that he
had been Arraigned for murder. Having !'
lost all his Dronrrtv hw anmKlin- U- t--j 11

committed murder, in order to replenish his J.
exhausted means. Eloquent efforts ivere j
made to clear hurt but in vain. The Ver-;
diet Was " guilty." 1 ^
Upon my return to the country, I learnthat
the time for Gustavas' execution was jj
not fak* distant. DtsiVous to witness his last; tj
moments, I remained until the awlul period
came. 1 saw the massy gates of the prison tj
yard open, and ere their grating sotind had j
died away, I beheld the train proceeding to
ward the place of execution, 'k he mourn- ^
ful procession reached the spot and Gustavas ( a
ascended the scaffold. His firm features^
Were unrelaxed. There Was not a quiver on i
his lip nor a tear in his eye. He spoke a 1 Q
few words to the assembly?reverting to his; u
pious parentage?his early youth unstained a
by crime?unshaded by remorse, until hin!

Robett of lite and himself from peace and ^

and opcbed the flood-gate ol profligacy and ^
crime: As he drew Heat* the closed? his ad- j,
dress, he manifested some feeling. His voice a
before full-toned; became feeble and indis- ^
tinct. What was his last expression! 4Ne- t(
ver be a Duellist." Wheh the world was
fading in the |dim-distiince and the solemni- w
ties Of Eternity, ill all their terrific reality, c
were rising before his vision, then, did he j'h
beseech listeuing thousands to discoUrage ,
and pill doivn the practice of duelling.? L|
Death is the sure test of opinion, as well as ,1{
principle and in tnis instance, it was very ap-l '
parent, that a lotlg cherished idea could not
bear the touch stone. Gtistivas?the once
lofty Unbending Oustavas underwent a change ^
eire he stepped off the s?tfge of existence.-? 8
His last feelings were leelihgs of repentance q

world acquainted With them. ,
| When he had cloeed, the halter was I
placed around his neck, and in a few mo> c
menu, his appearance told every spectator,
that another aoul had departed into the uu- .

WiH yob, believe reader, remember the
ast advice of the unhnppy Gustavas? If

hat you have a rough and thorny road beore

"Where Ignorance Is bliss, 'tis folly to

But having had some experience ourelves,
we may give you some hints,

ccomplish your purpose, to reach the ob?ct
of your hope, and ambition ? Do yoU
xpect them to come to you without any
xerlio'n on your part? If so, you will
ome far short of your expectations, nothng
is to be gained in this life without

In the first place then, you should eni

and details. Be not satisfied with
nerely doing, because you must do, what
s expected of you, but do all you can,
tot only to please your employer, but to
cquire a practical knowledge of the
usiness; remember you are an apprentice
and are acquiring the information,
irhich is to enable you to carry on the.
ame business for yourself?this Is the ,
bject of your labor ; you should feel that
ou are at work ior your own benefit and
ot for the benefit of others. Suppose

^ou have leisure hours morning

and let your books be selected in Vefrence

rhich give you information as well as

So much, of an individual's success in

ttained without mixing in refined socie- / '
/ and avoiding low vulgar company; he ^ '
rho chooses to associate with low bred
nd ill inannered companions ran never
ope to guiH admittance into refined and
