"I can eauier teach twenty what were good to '
be done, than bo one of the twenty to follow
mine o#u teaching."
I am not going to bore thee, gentle
reader, with a chapter on the variety of
?tritietitna." I am not the roan for that
?in truth I am a plain old fashioned sort
of fellow, who knoweth little more about
botanical name*, than the girl who said,
she knew very little about any flowers,
except those boionging to the class of
"dilirium tremens." By the by, Du
B<*e, that might not he half so had a hit
after all. Hast thou not seen the ladies
sporting with many Jlower9 belonging to
that class, in these modern times ? But s
..a m ~a II T _l A 0
Minis is trom tho purpose.' I was anoui
to ask s plain question. Why is it, so
few of our farmers make good crops of
wheat? Well, I think I hear a doaen
old fellows answer?why they dont try,
that's it. I believe it is the truth?and
as this is about the season for a talk on
that subject, let's have it.
To sow wheat after corn, is very trying
to land?but if you must do it, do try and
turn the vegetable matter which covers
the ground under, before it is dried ap, or
killed by the frost. Set your plough
deep, and turn up the soil?and lot it be
done well; no scratching and skipping
for these things are insufferable.
Now, run your seed through a screen u
before you sow it, to take out the soeds of n
cockle and other weeds, which infest the k
crop. Soak it 10 or 1 h hours ina strong t
notation of blue.stone. A bo ill 1.4 lb. fl
dissolved in what water will soafc a bush, a
el, is a very good preparation.! If ycu Z
cannot get hluc.stono, take copperas, and | m
if you cannot get copperas, try lye orjii
- "
I t
jrine, with a strong addition of saltpetr
?and you may rest assured you wil
lave no smut in your wheat.
The effect cf the blue.stone I hav<
leen so often, that I have no doubts 01
the subject. I'm wilting to go before i
magistrate anytime on that point. It i
moreover a powerful stimulant, hence, in
?ures you a better "stand" and forcesth
plant in itsdetelopement.
Now roll ycir seed while wet, in stronj
lime, and youadd another stimulant, a
well as the sirest preventive of the Hes
Bian fly I hav- ever known.
I know an experienced practical far
mer, who hafpursued this plan for man;
years, and ha never been troubled wit)
the fly, whi| his neighbors, even thoa
who bought heir seed wheat from him
suffered by f severely?and that's what
call pretty hrd to got over.
Some famers recommend immcrsinj
the seed forlO or 15 seconds in boiling
water, l>efafr rubbing it in the lime, a
a more ecfin method of killing the egg
of the fly, diich by a good glass are sai?

grains thaare infected.
Now, life would lie a very pretty place
to bra nc hatf in to a learned entomologica
enquiry fl the origin, nature and habit
of the Hssian fly?whether it is "Cecid
omvia"estructor, Ceraphron deatructor
or Cecinmyia tutica?whether it raakei
its apparance in the shape of long, thii
in futon, gelatinous semi-transparen
homognsous contractile, without verte
hra, ovradiated tentacula, or hyalim as
pect, gc., but this would be killing?
and fttters not to me, what names the*
soi dfctant scientific gentry may envel
opetfiese little destructors?it is suffi
ciert fnr me to know, that I have cxtrac
tedfron the wheat in four weeks after il
ha/ be? sown, from one to four smal
se/ii-tnnsparent destructors (I should cal
tbm) within the sixteenth of an inch ol
tie grail?when there was hut one lea
t< the iheat, and when the grain hac
fiteverlost its shape, or dropped its en
elope. The blades thus effected, were
'ellow, nd ultimately died. In fact, thai

that tfmg enough evidence for me?but
very tan to his notion, as the girl said
when fe kissed the cow. Again, put

MR. alley'S VISIT TO ENGLAND.
Messrs. Gay lord & Tucker : Being
10* on my way home to Buffalo, and
mowing the anxiety of my friends tc
earn the success of my agricultural expeJition
to England, I avail myself of a few
moments of leisure to state the general re.
lult. In swine I went into a thorough
ind minute examination from the differ,
mt species of the Chinu, the wild boarol
isia, and from the forests of Germany,
ipecimens of which I found in the Zoolo.
jical Gardens and on the estates of the
loblemen and gentlemen in different
>arts of the country, 1 also examined ai
he original breeds of England still lef
)f any consideration, and the various
:rosses8 and improvement that have beer
nade on them by importations from
ibroad. I also saw specimens of the
talian, Spanish, French, German, ant
lusaian breeds; then Scotch, Irish, and
iVeah, with crosses too numerous tc
nertion. And the result of the whole i?
hal the Berkshires, as, brought to thii
:ouitry by Mr. Hawes, and such as 1
lavs heretofore and now imported, Foj
general purposes of the fanner are
ipen the whole, the very best^ ani
mala in the world. There are ?om?
inds of swine that beat them as tosifce
nd others, perhaps, in little minor points
lut what I wish to he understood as a?
jrting is, that the Berkshire unites mon
ood qualities in him for general purpo
;s than anything within my knowledge
nd incoming to this conclusion, I stak<
e my reputation aa & breeder, and my judgII
ment as a man; and although I may be
called an intereated party, t may be. pers
mitted to alto add "without prejudice,
n and after a long, laborious, strict, and, I
a sincerely trust, an impartial inrestigas
tion
i. Bgrkshires in England are spreading
e very rapidly, and are also now taken to
Sco'land, Ireland, and other parta of the
g world. The name, consequently, aa with
s ua, has become very popular; and all
i. sorts of impositions are there practiced aa
well as here, with grades and every ima.
ginable breed. But the real true animal
y in shape, color, and quality, is precisely
fi such as Mr. Hawes first imported here,
e saving one exception ; and that is, a pig
i, will Rowland thenbe^cast after the model
I and color of the original breed; as figured
in Lowe's Illustrations, viz., sandy or huff
j with waves or sports of black, and also
gr black with some spots or waves of white;
s but the fancy of the people inclining to
s those more black, or a ciara, ncn, piumu
j color, just flecked with a little white, the
e lighter colored and buff ones have been
constantly thrown out, till they breed
? with now and then a stray pig, as I have
I so often before explained in the pages of
a the Cultivator. For my part, I rather
. fancy a slight buff with the hlack, and I
, found tholargest hogs in the county so
9 marked, after the old original. Windi
sor Castle has a buff spot on one, fore leg,
t besides a slight flecking of the same on
. other parts of him ; and T noticed that
. more or less of his stock was thus mark
ed.
The old breed has become nearly ex.
. tinct, a few specimens only remaining;
. and these so degenerated in size that
. they are not now so large even as the
t present improved race ; not comparing
I at all with Windsor Castle. All assured
I me that he was the largest animal that
f had been bred in the county for twenty
f years; and in the last No. of the Culti|
vator you have rather under than oversta.
. ted his dimensions. I know from what I
i saw of the weights of inferior sized Berk,
t shires fatting in England, that he may be
t made to easily attain 600 pounds. Added
, to (his great size, he is fine in his points,
> a most excellent conformation, and what
| is rather remarkable, of soft thin hair
i and skin. I took unwearied pains with
i nil my other selections; and though I
i could find none else qnite as large as
* Windsor Castle; they perhaps had a trifle
, more of fineness of point and fashion.
i In regard to the size of hogs, breeders
\ and pork packers in England take the
same ground as I informed the public
I in Inut fnlv's Cultivator, thatthcv had in
*"V ' *
: Cincinnati, the greatest pork market in
America, and upon precisely the same
) principles; and it would be a waste of
i time forme to add another word on the
subject. Large animals have cnnse
qucntly become very scarce in Berkshire,
> and exceedingly difficult to find. I per.
.tonally perambulated all Berkshire and
' the neighboring counties, and also em*
ployed agents who are dealers in pigs,
each one of whom annually buys theu.
sands, and knows every man's breeding
' in the country, to assist me; and I sent
: over by the London packet ships Media,
i tor and Wellington, and am to receive
next season stock from all the different
' families bred there that are worth poe.
sessing. These I shall keep apart in
| breeding at home ; and thus, I trust,
' save the necessity of further imports*
tions for twenty years to come. Stock |
of all kinds is very high in England now. |
Pork and mutton sell readily in market
at 6d to 7 1 -2d sterling; equal to 18
r and 14 cents per pound of our money.
| White, light spotted, black blue, gray,
, and all sorts of colored pigs may occa.
. sionally be seen in Berkshire county; but
r i the people there would scout the idea of
, their being called by their name; they
i would consider it an imposition, and 1
, might almost add, an insult. And, to
f my numerous questions, what do you call
( them? They would give me some spe.
, cific name, or say, "we don't know,
. they're not our sort." 1 do hope now
t for henceforth and for ever to hear no
I more about white and other Berkshire^
t than as here described for perhaps the
j hundredth time as the true and genuine
, breed, as improved by the Siamese cross.
, [ have full notes of all these things; the
5 discussion of which alone would occupy
| a long articlo, which I must defer to
I some more convenient period.
> Failing to find Bcrkshires as large as 1
f anticipated when leaving home, I imme.
i didiately set to work with my agents for
[ some other breed ; and after a volume of
r inquiries, and traversing half the king
f dom, I found the Kemlworths, tne very
. largest breed of swine at present existing
? in Great Britain. The owner of the sire
. of one of the pair of pigs I purchased,
asserted that he would weigh, full fatted,
v 1,700 lbs.; but I think his maximum
? would not overgo l,3001bs. He stood
. four feet high, was proportionality long,
. with no bristles, but thin hair, and really
? possessed a fineness of points that abso
lutely surprised me in so large an animal i
Indeed in general shape and conforms. tion
he nearly approaches the Berkshire. 1
His color was pure white. The size of i
the other pigs was not quite so large, and 1
a trifle coarser, while the sows were still !
less J hut this 1 was informed was always J
the case with the breed. I do hope that (
my friends now will he satisfied; for they j
have at last in these, a large hog, and,
above all, a white one. But if these are
not large enough, I shall quite despair,
and recommend the importation of a rhinoceros
that I saw flourishing alongside
of an elephant hardly superior to him in
size, at the Zoological Gardens of Regent's
Park in London. He was upwards J
of four feet across the buttock, and might ^
welgn some three or four tons.
I shall not have any of the KenniK ?
1 worth breed of pigs for sale short of a ^
year, I propose crossing the males upon |
the large white Yorkshire, and also with
a few of my Berkshire*. I think the j
produce of either will be of great size and t
excellent quality; and ns the number of ^
sows to be stinted in December to farrow _
to a Kennilworth boar in the spring will j
hft in Accordance with the orders of my i
friends for this cross, they will please to ?
let me know their wishes on this head
as quick as possible; for they may be as
sured, that even with this produce, they j,
may safely compete for gain of flesh, in j
a given space of time, with Woburns, or g
any other bieed that gentlemen may hap- ^
pen to have on hand for the purpose of a t
banter.
Nothing can be superior to the South y
down sheep that I brought over for Mr. f
Rotch, of Otsego county, this State, and ^
our late minister at the Court of St.
James, Mr. Stevenson, and Bishop Meade ^
of Virginia. The sire of Mr. R.'s buck tj
won the flrst prize, 30 sovereigns, as the ^
best of his age, at the Royal Agricultural {
Show at Liverpool in July, and was let
to the Duke of Newcastle for this season
only, for 100 guineas. He was consid- ^
ered as near perfection as it is possible j
for a sheep to be; and I may add that
the son 1 chose, is no disgrace to his sire. ^
Though only six monthsold, he weighed
when brought on board ship at London *
152 pounds. Mr. Stevenson's and Bishop
Meade's, about 18 months old. weigh- jj
ed respectively 254 and 248 pounds. And y
the breeder of theso superb animals, Mr. t|
Jonas Webb, of Babraham. killed a weth- w
er last Christmas that weighed, dressed n
with the head on, 200 pounds. The ^
bucks of this flock usually shear from 10
to 11 1-2 pounds; and I need not add
another word to the readers of the Cultivator
as to the superiority of South Down
mutton, and the hardiness and good constitution
of the animals making it. j(
Accompanying the sheep for Mr. f(
Rotch, was the most beautiful shepherd's n
dog that I ever saw; and of a breed so t|
good, that it requires no instruction to e;
break them into the management and
care of flocks. I also brought over for a
Mr. R. some of the large Dorking fowls, Q
that carry an extra toe to their heels. w
To these I added a few pheasants, the n
beautiful frame bird of England, and a P
o w
croas from which on the common barn n
fowl produced the celebrated game cock 4
breed. ?j
Of Short Horns I brought nothing, for tl
fear of the disease so prevalent through- tr
out horned stock in England, and because a
there is but one man's herd that can im. t(
prove our own; and his best I cannot have y
till another year. It really pains me to H
see any more Durhams of ordinary quali- jj
ty imported into our country. The ex- ^
pense of shipping is enormous; and, after
all, they are now so plenty in America y
that they can be bought for half or two u
thirds the price abroad; and throwing e,
two or three stocks out there, New York, ^
Ohio, and Kentucky alone, might show c
successfully against all England. This ^
is ray deliberate judgment after a very j
careful examination of the best Short c
Horns in that country. Ayrshires we r|
can make here bv the thousand, by cross,
ing Durham hulls on our best native milk. n
era. The Scotch black cattle without j(
horns make the hest beef in England;
and he is a capital hardy animal, and pro. jr
bably pays the grazier a better profit R
than any other; but he is black, which
don't happen to be a popular color, so c
that there is no use in talking of him. ?
Herefords you have already pretty well
discussed. The Sussex and South De
vons are scarcely inferior to them in size, ^
and of a beautiful blood like symmetry ^
of form that excites universal admira* ^
tion.

For horses, England ought to come to .
us. She has nothing that can compare
with our famous trotters; and our Dutch
Pennsylvania wagon horses are far pref. P
- - - i . i *. i i
erable, in my estimation 10 ner dobbicu
great cart horses. Our climate and soil,
especially in the ptimitive regions, is n
much superior to that of England, to pro- h
duce this noble animal in perfection; and d
we have only to pay a little more atten- g
tion to this department of stock to soon t
become large exporters.' *\
There are many other things, especial- t
ly in seeds, methods of cultivation, and (
the condition of the people of England,
that f would gladly touch upon, hut I find ^
my sheet already full and must forbear;
and to conclude, I hailed England with i
delight, and left it with deep regret. It "j
is a charming country, bating its everlast- ^
' s
I fig fain and coal smoke. And th
American finds id much in hie Rssocif
lions and remembrances there, that aft*
ill it is the country that he visits abroa
frith the most interest and profit* I d<

DISEASES or HORSES HILLING CORN.
Thecharaltanism practice in the ined
:al treatment of horses readily account!
ir the unfortunate termination of thi
lost of their diseases. At least such it
ie conclusion deduced from my Jimite<
xperience. *
The first horse I ever owned contractec
n inflamation of the liming membram
f the eye, from exposure in severe wintei
eather, and the action of the reflectec
iys of the sun when the ground wai
overed with snow. Every one who wit
eased the progress of the film which ren
ered his vision hourly more obscure, in
sted on the immediate and free applies
on of burnt alum. The remedy wa.<
ied, persisted in, and in a fortnight th<
mmal was stone blind. I reflected af
srwards how injudiciously 1 had acted ir
ielding to current opinions when the}
rere opposed to the principles of nature
[ere was a horse, affected with an ncut.
isease of a sensitive tissue, due in i
reat measure to a constitutional affection
et treated as though the part was desti
ite of vitality, and without any refer
nee to the state of the general system
fnder different circumstances the appli
ation of burnt alum would doubtless havi
een very proper?that is, when the con
ition of the affected part demanded in
reased action. But the. case was jus
jversed.
I last winter had a horse affected in f
lanner precisely similar, and receive(
" - * t r
ientically the same aavice irom unw
round me, I determined, however, to aci
i accordance with mv professional judg
lent. After proper depletion, therefore,
ie local inflamation was combated bj
old applications (Solution of Sugar n
iead, Ace.) and the use of necessary pre
autions to prevent irritation from exces
ive light. The active inflamation sub
ued, the film, which consists of a sec re
ion of fluid within, and the thickening h
he junctiva, or memhrahe covering thi
ye, was easily removed by a solution o
mar caustic, 10 gr s. to the ounce of wa
er, applied by means of a camel's hai
encil. The recovery within a fortnigh
ras complete.
I cannot understand why a rations
lethod of treating all diseases should no
e adopted. It es]>ecially becomes th<
luty of the farmer.physician to investi
-ate their diseases, rather than consigi
hem to the "horse doctor" with disgust
? ~ f
The error ot proscrimng iora name in en
ire ignorance of the proximate cause, o
he malady might soon he avoided,
eldom hear of the death of a horsi
rhere tho cause of it is professed to b
nown, and still more uncommon is it t<
tear of an examination being made afte
leath to clear up the mystery. But it i

ie | (he physiologist and anatomist alone who
l* i can derive much benefit from opening
it diseased animals after death,
d I may, in (his place record the remit of
my experience (he present year in hilling
" corn. About 1-4 of my crop was plough?
ed, in consequence of its being overrun
j with grass, My neighbors insisted upon
the necessity of it to support the stalk, or
i as one of my black men expressed it, to
expert the corn." From the diversity of
soil [ am unable to come to Shy conclusion
respecting the difference in vigor of
growth between that ploughed, and that
cultivated with flukes only; but am satisfi>r
ed, the quantity was not increased by the
'* former process, which necessarily exacted
6 additional labor. As to hilling the corn
l' affording it ant support, 1 am satisfied of
r* its inefficacy. The corn that was ploughed
was more prostrated by winds than
( the other-a result to be attributed, poasi(l
ble to its more exposed situation, for I do
. not imagine either mode of culture ran
e ders it less obnoiioua to the effect# of
i- hign winds.

with full confidence of its ultimate
success, were exerting themselves sealously
in promotion of the scheme. Captain
Hughes and Mr. Fitch, who are stated
to be the most efficient coadjutor# in
' the cause, were busily engaged in carrying
, out the plans of the government at the
n Madras presidency, whilst thoae on the
j Bengal side, (with Captain Bay lea as superintendent.)
are equally energetic hi the
I prosecution of their plana. From the
s Bombay branch we have no recent tid'
ings on the subject.?The American coti
ton seed and implements of husbandry %
% sent from England, had reachad Errodc, * .
and great preparations were making in
various parts of the country in bringing
this extensive enterprise into immediqpe
operation.
f At the Agricultural meeting ofCalcnt.
, ta, in May last, some of the soil of the is*
land of Cheduba was stated to bare tin*
t dergone analvzatioo, and was found to
r correspond exactly with that on which
the 9ca Island cotton of Georgia (8. C.)
' is produced. A report on the sobject of
' this important discovery had beerf made
, to the Indian government, and a cask, of '
Sea.Island cotton seed had been, accord'
ingly, shipped to Cheduba.
It has long been a dogma, among cotton
cultivators, that the description of soil so
[ favorable to the cultivation of cotton was
peculiar to America, thus yielding to that
country a vast monopoly in*the produc.
" tion of a superior cotton ; but we have at
last discovered a Sea.Island of our own,
and will, doubtless, turn it to a profitable
j account. We may here mention, ,th?t .?
the Bengal section of the American plan,
ters, in passing through Allabad, wero
shown specimens of Indian corn, which
they unanimously pronounced nearly, if
'r not quite, as good as they commonly met
r with in America.
