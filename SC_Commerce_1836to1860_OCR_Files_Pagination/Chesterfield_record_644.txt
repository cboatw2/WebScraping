for your improvement, I have thought it
best to take a review ofsomo peculiarities
existing in your soil, some causes operating
to your benefit or injur?, and thus
rr>*rectness and truth will he 'q tally ap

circumstances. With your lands I

that your large county furnishes; and in

most readily command. If Anly thrown

ofher, occasioned bv a greater decompo

repeatedly to he d' epcneil as your land j

On the subject of wet land, and llv i
great importance of thorough draining, I j
havo neve/ seen a better illustration of j
its happy effects, than an anecdote given i
hy the Jrte Judge Buel. "An aequain-1
tanc? rafted upon a Scotch farmer,
whose farm bad been under-drnmc \ and
being informed that the improvement
coat sixteen d dlars an acre, till hav.ng <

improvement. 4Yes," was the farmer's
repiv, 4 but it cost a deal mair no! fo rfo {?V j

by the first settlers, been the most bcauti i

; statement here made, a fid would thank {
j gentlemen to call 01 us and have an occul- J
ar demonstration of its correctness. W hen j
i my connexion, llr. Beat, first got posses- ;
; sion of his farm, a tenant had previously
1 cleared about thirty acres of his sandy
j land, and had then absolutely worn it out,
tlie last crop of rve he sowed producing

then possessed no other cloured land, all

timo hy ?>:i that poor sand bank! Mi st .
of the seed grew. A sorry crop ofgrain !
fol owed of course, hot Ids grass seed had j
fortunately taken wo!!, and in that he i
saw the germ of future fertility. It was \

applied to the brier* in August. (lis i
stock added hy their droppings a power- '
ful auxiliary well prepared.
That grass remained three year*, Rtih. j
joot to the same treatment, and was then !
turned under. A wheat crop followed, :
tli.V, I well recollect, was abundant. (
Clover and finiothv were again sown, 1
?
wit i soirn green,sward that he obtained
from Kentucky. By this time he had ;
cleared some of his front bottoms, and j
commenced feeding bus fodder from them '
on tnose exhausted fields, now Well sot '
"in sod. The process of feeding in the I
winter, and mowing any briers or weeds j
that spring up in tho summer, was continned
until he loft ou country and pas. ;
scd his estate to his son. At that time I
ttiose exhausted sandy fields were brought

former desolation. ji
Now for the benefits and subsequent (
profits tint hia aon I?;im boon enabled to j
enjoy, from the admirahlb course of treat. |
ment formerly given to this land. He !
ploughed ail up, and took two successive j
crops ofcorn, each averaging at least fifty j
hushoU to the acre. It was then sown '
in wheat, clover and timothy, giving a j
good yield of wheat, and taking w?il in j
grass, remaining but on? year in sod, his ((
fat cattle being tod on it in liio Winter, j
I? was ng un turned over, and two more (
successive crop* of corn, eqinily good,'
followed hv w heat and grass. Coniinti-!
rug twovoars and fi d on in the winter as |
usual, he last spring ploughed again for '
corn, and hasat this tirn^ a crop almost '
sufficient to take the premium to he awar- ;
dedon this occasion, it a niinimuin of one '
hundred hushoJs to the aim.
I must explain, that although the j

of this sandy land, vet the spot measured

at least sixty bushels of corn to the ncro.
You will observe hv th*? statement, that
after the renovation of the sard, s \* crop*, of

Mr Robert Wother % of straforil

in destroying the grubs which eat the In* J
dian corn. As soon as I discover that !
they attack my corn, I put a handful of1
lime upon each hill, and it has never failed !
to save my crop. This is the remedy all

Mr. ffol6rvo&, of Derby. Upon experiment.
I find the method of plowing land
for Indian corn, heretofore recommended 1
to this Society by Mr, MaMett, to be the !
< n I I _r !
best I can pursue. 1 Jay nit my mm, m (
every kind, in ridge*, when I intend it j
foi corn, and plow the balks clear, ley !
them to the ridges before planting, and
never disturb thoso ridge* by cross plowing.
Any person can see by looking at
the part of my fi**ld which I hrfve treated
in this way, and at another part of the i
same that was crass plowed, that the part j
laying in ridges has much the advantage, i
I have always haii full ovidenco tho aame

Mr. Waisicorth, of Durham. I have J
this year, 1800, niado the experiment of,

it in tho usual niodo.
Mr. Hoi brook I have rmdc further
experiments in plowing in ridgos for Indian
corn, and not disturbing hy cross j

crops will be a third better in this}1
way.
Mr. Clizunyjt of Xc:d Haven, I have
planted two acres oflaud this year, 1800, ,
with Indian corn; I plowed in the manner
mentioned heretofore by Mr. jlfallctt. I
The land ha* been mowed for five years j
past, and the sward is very tough. lMv j
corn is hotter than any of my neighbors j
have, and they agree with me that tills i
method has increased it a third.
From three years experience of tlio

Doctor Fcuhs, member of the Acade. ,
my of Science at Jfunirh, has diseovered
a composition by which hci renders H'ood

of granulated earth nnd an alkali. To i
obtain it the inventor says, you must dis- '
solve some grayojlv earth, which has been
previously well washed, and cleared from '
any heterogeneous matter, in a solution
of caustic alkali. This mixture has the
property of not becoming decomposed by
fire or water. When spread upon wood,
it forms a vitreous coat, and is proofj

Washington, April 13.
A most extraordinary and exciting
debate km arisen in the f?ouse on a motion
of the Abolitionists, to strike out the
appropriation for the outfit and salary of
Waopy Thompson, as minister to Mexico.
It was evidently a concerted movement,
and is to be supported by tbe
whole abolition intofoat in tho country, j
Mr. Linn, of New York, made the motion, J
accompanying it by a speech. Mr. j
Slade, of Vermont, followed him, on the l
samo side. The argument in favor of j
I ?A ?Kn n wrlion 1
the motion was oan;u <jw ,.?*> ,
made l>y Mr. Linn, and others, that ;
President Tvlfr i<* intriguing with a !
view to efleet the annexation of Texas to ;
the United States. This, they intimated
wis the main object of Gen. Thompson's
mission; and thov insistod tint Gen.
Thompson had sent instructions to this
eudL Tuey also alluded to the fact that
Gen. Thompson, when in Congress, was
an ardent friend to Texas, and in favor
of the annexation; and is, therefore, an j
unsuitable person to represent this country ;
in Mexico, unless our object he to.acqnire j
Texas. They said that the South might |
possibly succeed in this policy, but that I
it would he at the expense of tho Union '
of these States. They declared that ihe '
great majority f?{ the free States would
separate, at once, from the Union, in
case Texas should be admitted into it; !
and that it would also bring upon hs a war '
?vith England. It was also urged that ;
the trade of the United States with Me*- !
ieo was not of sufficient extent to justify j
the maiptajcaoce of a mission there.
Mr. Pickens and Mr. Cushing replied,
and pointed out the importance of tho
Mexican mission, in relation to tho designs
of Groat Britain upon California
and Cuba, and also in relation to the
questions at issue b;t\vecn this country '
and Mexico.
Mr. Wise also replied, at great length, '
and made a very interesting speech. Ho
asked what evidence there was for the
assertion that President Tyler was in favor
of annexing Texas to the United
States ? [Mr. I-inn. , Does tho gontle
.u?., it 71 Mr. U'iso replied, no;
111*11 unn U ij ..... _ ,
but, if I did, the gentleman would find it j
difficult to prove it. I know not, said
Mr. Wise, how the fact is, and I intend .
tr> inquire. But, judging from circuin- ;
stances, my private, opinion is, that Pres- !
dent Tyler is desirous of annexing Texas \
to the Union ! I am the more inclined 1
to this opinion from the fact that it was
the darting object of several of Mr. Ty.
i?/- nPM^ressor*: aud especially of the
?*~l "? , , T
administration of the gentleman from
Massachusetts, Mr. Adams. [Here the
members began to stare"\vith surprise at
Mr. Wise, imagining that he was rt littlo
out of his right senses ] But Mr. Wi.se
brought forth certnin instruction* from the
Stale Department to Mr. Poinsett, written.
in March, 19*25, when the gentleman j
frotn Vermont (Mr. Slade) was a Clerk !
in that Department. .
Mr. Wise read the letter of Mr. Clay ;
to Mr. Poinsett, then the minister of the J
United States in Mexico, wherein he
? a ? 9 -t W*. - I
states that he is directed oy me President!
to request Mr. Poinsett to offer n sum of j
money to the Mexican government to j
make the boundary line between the U.
5>. and Mexico the Rio Del forte?and
to urge upon Mexico, as an argument in
favor of giving up Texas to us, that our
people had already occupied the territory
and would never coalesce with Mexican
institutions, &c. These documents crpatod
the greatest surprise in the Hoqsr. I
do not believe that ten member# were
aware of their existence. But I am told
there is much more to the same effect that
could be got from the archives of the
silate Department. Mr. Adam? tfas very
attentive to what passed, and took some
notes.
Mr. Wise u'ont on to point opt the
hostile policy of England and of Mexico
towards pssrinsisted that we ought to de.
clare war upon Mexico and England
both; that Franco would aid ijs, <Scc.?
In fact, it was a real war speech. He
said a war would do us np hprt?hut it
would do us much good. It would giVP j
us Texas and annex it to fho Unioq. It ;
would enable us to put down the aboli.
tionists at honjo. He believed too that a

degree of prosperity under existing tren. ;
ties, and whethor any measures aro ne
cessary to secu.o reciprocity, came up.
Some debate followed on this subject, in
which Mr. Woodbury maintained th
free trade doctrines and Mr. Simmons
those of the protec/ive policy. No qwes
lion was taken on the subject.
In the House, the general appropriation
bili, was again under discussion, and I
have never listened to a debate which
3 :err)"d to excite njnro iot'erost. The
que it:o 1 wa< on the motion to strike out
the appioprlation for a minister to Mexico.
D > Butler, of S. Carolina, spoke J
in oppositiou to this motion, eulogizing !
the character of the minister to Mexico,
and made some remarks in support of
."VJr- VVise's vieys as to the policy of ac
quiring Texas.
Mr. Charles J. lagnrsoll, <?f Piiila.
county, spoke very ably on .some of the |
topics which had been brought into the !
discuseion-r-partjephrly of the difficulties J
with England. He ran ovef^ho p?infj in j
controversy, statipgXhat, in hi* opinion, j
England was >yrong in rvr-ry one of
them ; nn,I said they would pui.tlj&r of
them lead pe.q*ss$rijy to ? war. The
right of search was the. most difficult
matter to settle, and ho would undc/Uke
(o prove by reference to thirty treaties,
made during tbo last two centime*, that
thn right had always been disputed.?
There was no foundation for it, in.the law j
of pature < r nations. He complimented J
Gen. Cass's interpojiition.cn this subject, ;
and intimated that he had influenced the j
Chamber of Deputies, in France, to re- j
fuse to ratify tbe quintuple treaty. He '
slid fiot agree that we were unpieparol
for war. Wo were full of .resources for a
prolonged warfare. Our population wr* i
great; ou^means pf subsistence innx j
haustihle; our materials for wa-r .return- j
da at; and our skill and inventive faculty j
unbounded; our thousand steamboats. 00
our lakes aod fixers, could, >8 top day<, ;
he ready to defend our roast. The two |
steam ships .now jp opr harbor were, ns he j
lied been told by a (iisfjpgyished oftjeer, )
unequalled in the world as .specimens oT j
that species of war vetnH. ft hpd been j
?aid that New York would he burptj but !
he had been assured by naval officers
that it would be as easy for us to burn i
London. It had been threatened that j
England would excite a portion pf the ,
vmulation at the South ; but wouid not 1
/ i* i
we excite, in like manner, some 01 c^ng. j
land's dependants? Ireland, Canada, j
and India sho held by a thread. She
would, in ease of another war, tumble to
pieces, like one of our banks, at a run for
specie payment. He did not think we
could bo much injured by a war?and ii ;
might do iis some good. It would pay j
off our debt of two hundred million* to
begin with?that was certain. But we ;
should not be alone; France. Prussia, and !
Russia would sympathize with us. We I
should have the sympathy of all the no- |
tiojnsof the earth?including Texas. Mr. j
Ingersoll hoped that the noble ministor, ,
now here, would succeed in his errand. ;
and he believed thnt he could, if be should
act wisely. He might, and ho hoped
would, make himself an Earl, by his ser.
V-icet here. Mr. Ingersoll .nsisted,
throughout his speech, that England was
in every esse wrong, und must concede
every thing to tin.
Mr. Adams, in commencing his reply
to those that had spoken, commenced
with an assault on Mr. Ingersoll. He
accused him of an attempt to drive the
American people into a war with Kng
land, under peaceful professions, and of
making light of the evils of war, and of
cur defenceless nnd unarmed condition.
| Tl-e gentleman moreover contended
that Great Britain must yield every thing
?and wo nothing?that peace could be
preserved by no other moans?that Great
Britain was wrong in every case, even in
that of the Creole. The gentleman too
hud told us that Franco was with us on .
i the riirht of search. If ore Mr. A. went j

avowed this question in the Chamber,
owing to certain consideration*, and there- w
fore the vote was unanimous for refusing
to ratify the treaty, But he would venture
to say that the treaty would be ratified
rn three months time. It was of no
consequence, in reference to the right of .
search, whether tb*? treaty was ratified or
not. For, by other tubsiaung treaties,
France and England had mutually yielded
this right. Mr. Ca?a might have been
humbugged with the idea that the&fottl
to ratify tho treaty was owing to the
right of search nuestion. but there were
1 '
other nnd very different causes of delay# J2i
Mr. A. spoke of the precarious condition
of France, pictured what soon to be her
condition-?-and asked what aid she could
render us in a naval war with England,
when sho herself would be rent with civil
commotions, and engaged in war with four
<)f the leading powers of Europe? Moreover,
qpon the gentleman'* principle, w?
would, in case of war, be obliged to give
up the right of search ourselves; and
thereby doprive ourselves of the moat
easy rpeans pf prippling British power.?
For Iiqw could we cripple her commerco
if we allowed her to protect her property
bv covering it with a actual flag ?
Mr. A. did not agree to the right of
search a# claimed hy England, nprtotho

had filled an honorable place in Rrifjift)
history, might rjwke blfjisef an Etfl hy
settling this difficulty, according to the
y o vsofthe gentleman from Peijnsyly^.
mn, he treated with 77"ch ridicule. Rod*

degyee lower than an Barldony >kut n??J
by yielding every thing ; Wellington
made a Dukc-~ht/t not for surrendering
every thing intrusted to hjnj. /nbl) Rulj

for th* purpose of suppressing the African
slave trade. Ho declared that he would
sooner meet war, with all its ho'ror*, tha^i
concede this. He stated that this had
always been his ground. Ho thoreforo
opposed, with all hi# inQuence, the treaty
which this government ratified for a rnu?
tual right of search on the- African coast
and which Groat Britain rejected becaii*?

Mr. Adams did not satisfactorily shew
i t his reply to Mr< Wise, any reason fjr
opposing ?he annexation of 'jfexas now, Pqfl
when he made such an etf?>rt to obtain
it purchase from Mexico, in the very first
month of his Presidency. He alluded to
to the fact that lie opposed Mr. Monroe's
treaty of 1819, by which Texas was gir.
en up ; and that he u I ways contented lor
the Roi del Norte as the boundary?but
lie did not shew why he was now opposed
to theJ acquisition At Texas, except
by alicgi&g what every ono knows to bn
umounded, that the Southern people wish
to get Texas in order to re-open tho African
slave trade to re-establish slavery J
in Mexico. He asked Mr. Wise whether,

Mr. Campbell of S. C. replied wilh
great felicity to some ef Mr. Adams'

even should Mr. Adams ever succeed in
