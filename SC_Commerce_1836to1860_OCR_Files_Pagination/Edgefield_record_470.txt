The following important information
respecting a most unprovoked outrage 01
American' citieus, we copy from the Bos
son Morning Herald of the I Ith inst
We learn from a gentleman who-arrived
in this city last'evening at 12 o'clock, ii
whose veracity we think we may depend
.hat auother .trost cowardly attack hat
been tmiltted on the Disputed Territo
ty, apon three American gentlomen by
some fellows calling themselves 'mountec
patroles.' It seerms that the gentleme
tibove named, viz. Thomas F. Templeton
George Cady and Job-H. Kenwick, were
proceeding from Bangor to Canada, and
an their arrival near Madawasca,* a party
of armed British soldiers met them. Mr
Cady inquired tof one of the soldiers the
.nost direct road to take. .-He gave hin
the necessary information, when four
others came upand asked Mr. Cady some
impertinent questions as to tle object o
- his journey. Mr. C. replied very proper
ly and proceeded to turn the horses int<
the road, when one of the squad steppet
in front of the carriage and asked what
the feelings of the people were in relation
to the burning of the Caroline. Mr. Tem
pleton said they were very naturally indig
nant at such a dastardly act, and that eve
ry. true American warmly expressed a hope
that McLeod, the leader of the offienders,
should suffer the severest punishment of
the laws of the country. "If McLeoc
burnt thit old hulk," replied the soldier
." he deserves our thanks, and if a hair of
his head is injured, you, and your datnnd
countrymen, will be made to repent it
dust and ashes." . The gentleman made
no other reply to this insolent remark than
to request the leaders to allow them a free
and unmolested passage. But four or five
of the cowards seized the reins, and charg
ed the gentlemen as "spies," and refused
to let them pass unless they subjected
themselves to a search. The gendinen
remonstrated upon this unparalleled pro
ceeding; and as they were unarmed, not
having even a cane to protect themselves
with, they were unable to offer any resis
tance.. One of the ruffians then seized
Mr. Cady by bis coat and attempted to
pull him from the carriage, the other two
gentlemen threw the soldier from the car
riage who fell prostrate in the road. The
whole party then came up and made a
dreadful attack upon the gentlemen, during
which Mr. Cady was knocked down with
the butt of the musket, and Mr. Temple
ton received a severe wound in the shoul
der with a bayonet. Mr. Kenwick attempt
ed to escape by running, but one of the
-party fired upon him, and he received a
ball an his right thigh-he fell to the ground.
At this stage ofthe crisis one of the officers
came up, and checked further hostilities.
He immediately procured assistance, and
had the wounded gentleman conveyed to
the camp and medical aid immediately
procured for him. After which they were
by their request taken to the town from
which they last came, where a depositior
ed sworn to.
Our informant states that the gentlemen
are in a fair way to recover. lie was to

we have received letters and pn pers from Mata

late intelligence from the Mexicau capital, nor
any of particular interest from other quarters.
General Arista was expected to arrive at Ma
tamoras in a few days from the frontiers. Not
a word is said about the raising of troops or the
invasion of Texas. On the contrary, the Fed

is stated were returning to their former places

There is some reason to believe, and we cer

now no preparation making on the other side

dria, of Pensacola, bound home from New Or

who had been shipped in New Orleans to join
a vessel at Pensacola. The Alexandria sailed
during tie last December.
A short time after sailing from the city the

drove them ashore, and took possession of the
scheonier. They soon grounded her. The
Ca pin enme to Pass Christian for assistance,
an a party was formed and fully armed, and
sailed for her. On reaching the vessel, they
found the mutineers had killed the cook sooi
after the captain left; quarrelled among them
selves, murdered three of their own party;
hoisted part of the cargo from the hold and
threw it overboard. They were secured, and
were to be transposted to New Orleans as soon
as the schooner floated.
There was tint one American among the
seven, though the shipping master who for
warded them had been instructed to send all
Americans.
Economy--A slight knowl-dge of humant
nature will show that when a man gets en a
little inf the world lie is desirous of getting on
a little further. Such is the growth of provi
dent habits, that it has been said if a journey

made. Those who have bestowed atteition on

In proportion as individuals save a liutle nmon

given to their morals, and they behave better
for knowing they have a little stake in society.
It is scarcely necessary to remark that habits
of thoughtfuliness and frugality are at all tines

The number of memorials presented in th
Senate, to-day, in flvor ofthe general bankrny
law, was unnsnally gent, but at the sat:1
time there were a few' memorials igainst th,
measure.
The Sennte appeared to be much en-rossei
with the subject of the public lands. fn fact
it is a matter of considerable importance to al
the Senators, in a political point of view. Aluc
capital is to be made out of it. The Senator
from the mniddle end eastern States can raise i
considerable excitement abont the effort to de
prive then of their share in the public dotnaiti
which was obtained by their blood and trea
iure. On the other hand, the Senators fot1
the new S'ates can make it appear very reason
able and proper to their own constituents tha
they should be masters of their own soil. Th
political agitation respecting the public lands i
increasing, and will continue until it shall be
in some way settled.
M r. Southard,,to-day, concluded a very stronj
old State speech an the subject, and Mr. Clay
of Alabama, will next make a w State speecl
in regard to it. The result will be that uothin
will be done in the matter at present.
In the House, Mr. ("ampbell attempted ti
introduce a resolution to pay Mr. Ingersoll a
a member of the House from the time when h<
preferred his claim to a seat to its decision. bn
it was strongly against the sense of the Housq
and was not received.
The custoi of paying members to come hen
and consume the tune of Congress in contest
for seats is a bad one, and onght to be distised
The House has held out high preminnAis fo;
contests of this sort; and after awhile they wil
have nothing else to do bit to hear and ndjndg
such cases. The uniform rule shOuld be tha
but one member should be paid for the sam4
seat.

COTTON.
"The cotton planters are sending down theii
bales with anl activity which proves that th
present prices-although low enough, in nI
conscience-are not calculated to remove th
inclination to make sales. About three hundre<
thousand hales have been received in New Or
leans, within the last three niontlis, while th<
reports of new arrivals show no falling off
Either conon plaiters are content with the pre
snt low prices, or else- they are grievouslj
pinched for money. The opinion of the know
lg ones, in the cotton trade, is almost unani
mons as to an advance in the price of cotton
on or abont the latter end of Mlarch or begin
ning of April."
The above is an extract from a late numbei
of the N. O. Courier. We have noticed th<
same thing repeatedly before. It will be ob
served, however, that die receipts of cotton it
all the great Southern ports are beginning t<
fall off rapidly as compared with last year, all
that they are short iow about 70,000 bales
We predicted that such would be the fact, an<

by a recent communication from our friend
Dr. Win. B. Johnson, ihat, by anl act of
the Slae Convention of South Carolina,
a Professors Reynolds and Chaplin. of the
Furman Institution, have been appointed

These brethren, it is understood, will take
in hand that part of the editorial labor
which properly pertains to the State of

it very materially abridges the responsi

greatly enhance the efficiency and the gen

Leap Year.-This interesting period for
the ladies has passed, and without their
having used it to much advantage in this
section, if we may judge from our hyrne
nial record for 1840. It has not been so
much neglected, however, in other parts
r of the country, for we notice in the last
Whig Banner, published at Lincolaton,
North Carolina, no lees thai six marriages
near the close of the period in which the
ladies are privileged to "pop the ques
tion." and four of the six are noticed as
"runaway natches," showing, beyond all
doubt, that the ladies wero in oernes."9
\Ve trust we shall, ere long, have some
thing in this line to record ourselves ; but
we would prefer that there should be no
necessity of adding the word "runaway,"
as the Banner has (lone. As the ladies
have been so modest during the past year,
we trust that our young men will now
make up for lost tine. We should like,
above all things, tosee a wedding; our vis

Ganbling.-Let every young man avoid
all sorts of gambling as lie would poison.
A poor man or boy should not allow himself
io toss ip for a half penny, for this is olte n
the beginning of a habit of gambling, and
this ruinous vice creeps on by slow de
grees. Whilst a man is minding his busi
ness, he is playing the best game, and is
sure to win. A gambler never makes any
good use of his money, even if he should
win. He only gambles thie more anid lie
is often reduced to beggary and despair.
He is frequently templed to commit
crimes for which his life is forfeited to his
country, or perhaps lie puts an end to him
self, to his miserable existence. If a
gambler loses, he injures himself; if lie
a wins, he injures a compansion or friend.
And could any honest man enjoy money
gained in such a way.-Advice to Labo

Institute of that place, told the following
amusing anecdote of smoking:
to smoking, had paid his addlresses to a
young lady, whose parents objected to the
union, merely because he indulged, as they
r thought, too freely in the use of tobacco.
The young lady, however, preposseseed
in his favor, prevailed upon him to ahan
tdon the habit, that their union might take
place. The antipathy of the umother, how
ever, to smioking, continued unabiated. and
she was still skeptical as to the fact of his
reformation on that score, and to test her
daughter's account that he had given tip
the practice ofsmoking, ehe invited him to
spend a few days at her house, with the
family. No symptoms of smoking op.
peared till one evening, when the mamn
mna. before retiring to rest, fancied that she
smelled somethitig like the fumnes of to
bacco in his biedroom. She looked throtugh
the keyhole, and lo ! and biehilod! the gen
tlemant was catighit in the act, ptuffig
aiway, with his feet uapoti the grate, and
thinking. no doubt, of maniy happy days
,with kis beloved object. The mother, in
haste. ran down stairs, called for her
Idaughter; saidh she had found him still
smoikinig, and wished hier to come up im
mediately and see. They Ilewv up stairs;
the another looked again into the keyhole,
saying to the daughter, "did I not tell you
lie still smoked? look in end see." "&li,
Ibut mother," said the daughter, "does he
not smorke beautifully."

wise wan has truly said, 4 there is a time for
every thing," we are led to conclude that there
is a time even for egotism; though our tastes
and habits unite to indicate that our sea.
son for displaying it should recur but seldom.
Yet as there as, or should be a time for the he
trayal of even this unattractive quality-par
donable in a journalist, if in any body-we
have concluded that the fit should visit us just
at this period. before entering bopon another
volume of our paper.
None can be more fully aware than we. of
the utter indifference of that Leviathan the pub
lie, to any matter so insignificant, as the pros.
perity or adversity o f a journal or its publisher.
Years of experience has convinced us, that
the cash system is, in the long run, the only
one upon which newspapers can be prosper
ously and independently conducted.
The charges for subscription are so small,
and yet so vitally important in the aggregate,
that the trouble and expense of tnaking collec
tion, is too ;pt to absorb all the anticipated pro.
fits and to defeat the hopeb of the proprietor.
All expenses of die office must be paid in
cash. Yet a subscriber when dunned for a
three or five dollar bill, is too apt inconsider
ately to regard it as a paltry business, to impor
tune him for so trifling an amount He does
not reflect, that several hundred subscribers,
being of the same mind with himself, mighi by
declining the liquidation of these " paltry
amounts," seriously embarrass an establish.
ment. -
For ourselves we can see no good reason
why a man should not pay his three or five
dollars down, when subscribing for a paper, as
well as his five or ten dollars, when he takes his
seat in a Steamboat or Rail Road car. He may
say there is a chance for the paper to stop be
fore the year is up. And so may the Steam
boat burst her boiler, or ite Rail Road car be
thrown from the track, and while in the latter
case you run a great risk of loosing your lives,
we assure you that you shall loose nothing
more than your money. The contingency.
however, in either case, is the saute.
Another advantage of the eash system is,
that it'is friendly to the perfect indepeindence
of the press. Subscribers in this country have
been too much inclined to regard it as an act of
patronage, on their part, to take a paper. If
there is any word in the Dictionary, for which
we have a moral aversion, it is that sane word
"patronage." It has done more to degrade.
and embarrass the press of the United States,
than all the " bribery and corruption," that po
litical chicanery ever engendered.
" The ungrateful fellow," said one of these
-rjwun.1r fx"JF01,- --r-- -e..- I
have given him my patronage ever since his
ten years, and no-v he sends in his bill of thir
ty dollars, and says he must have it paid or le
will sue nie. Ingratitude! thou hard hearted
friend. You my stop my paper sir, ant! you
shall have no more of umy patronage.
Heaven save us from all such " patronage"
say w.-The word should tie repudiated, ex
punged, and discarded, by every independant
man connected with the press. Int London the
newspapers are conducted upon thte cash sys
temn. Yout might as well ask to be trusted for
your fare from Liverpool to Manchester, as for
a yeats subscription to a London paper. We
are glad to perceive symptoms of the graduaj
introdnetie-t of the cash principle, into the news
ptper establishments in this country.
But as it concerns ourselves. We shall here
after at stated periods, scrutinize our books,
and all subscribers, who have foryears past re
ceived thme A dvertiser, without paying for it, and
still exhibit no signs of pay, wvill be suspended
tntil we hear from themn. For whenever a
subscriber has suffered his account to run
three, foutr and five years, we shall take it for
granted, that he does not like the paper wvell
enongh to pay for it-in which case we certain
ly do not wish to send it to him. We believe
this rule wiil prove fatisfactory to all who in
tend to pny; and, fr. m the opposite clases, 've
have received so hottntiful a "pntromnage,"
that we cotuld well atTord to dispense with their
favors hereafter.
In conclusion, we wotuld beg permission to
retturn our farvent thanks, to the friends whose
exertions have contributed so m-.uch to the mea
sure of the prosperity anad the patrontage we
now enjoy. May onar ftutre course jttstify,
though it cannot requite their generous assis
tance.
We have received from sotme unknmown per
son, an article without title or signature. We
are thankful for all favors in the way of useftul
information. comnprised in well wri.ten articles,
and signed by a responsible person. But we
must confess, that we are at a loss to determine
whtat the writer of the article in question intend
ed we shtould call it, or what signature we
should affix to it. We shtould not forget, how
ever, to express our thanks for the one dollar
bill enclosed, which we gratefully accept, bt
we cannot consent to publish his essay, until it
has been "revised and corrected," atnd is ac
copanied with a '-title," and a "signature."
The " Bachelor-s llutton," comes to us in an
entire new dress, and under a new title. Hav
ing lost its " Button," it nowv is what it truly
professes to be, " The Bachelor." Although
we are no friend to " Old Bachelors," we like
to see the prosperity of the press. The No's.

FORLEIGA1 AFFAIRS. -
The extraordinary parts now taken in Euro
penn affaits by England, France. Russia, Au
tria, and Prussia, are to us. Americans, so el'
traordinary; that, with difficuly, ea we under
stand or npprceiate them.
Wherever there ia trouble, ther* are ti's five
great Powerm who undertake to settle it, even
by arMs, as ifit were thei oas business, to her
transacted in their own States. 16eir theatre
of operationsjust at the present, appears to be
transferred from the Non of Europe, and
Spain, tothe East. and Eastern airirs,in which
they act towards Turkey, Egypt and Gyria, as
if they were but part and parcel of a commn
Empire, of theis own inheritage, which they
had a right to rule over. and govern,. as
would best suit their interests and purposes.
This may be all right, and all for the comues
good, lut the question naturally arises,-ft
peace the bjeetk or is if a common lust for
peaceably-won new dominions ?
The iictai'oaflirs in thies Old World, just
now, is not uioimuingular, titan the manner in
which they ar conducted. France it nthlg'
conquests in Africa- England has alreidje
tended, and is further extending les Sovesign,
power in the East. China, at. a. distance of
twelve thousand miles from London, is cob
tended for by an army created there, bu.t en
rolled under the British flag. Russia is in Cir.
cassia, aye, even meeting England in the East
Persia but remains between, ere long to be tie
common prey of Beti. Austria remains eow
tented w-th swaying her sceptre over Venice
iad alilan.. Prussia stands a looker-on, re
tainiag what she has lawhassly obtained, satis.
fied ifshe can keep it.
Two of the great powers figue rasgely fir
the New World. France in Mexico, and E.:
gland in South, or Central America. These
two, are perhaps the most restless and ambitious.
now, both endeavouing, probably, to make Vge
what they lost, or rather did not gain, upon i#
dethronement of Bonaparte.
Conquest, then, or a desire Ihr conquest, ii
the picture Euiope yet exhibits, but the one
now pending, is for different from any whiek
has preceded it. The rulers, since they have
brought the unfortunate Polanders under their
control, seem to have nnanimensly agreed' tb
let their own plunder alone, and direct thier at
tention to other parts of the world. It is agreedi
that the a geut t tii-Englandshall be presrved,.
but there is no stai quo beyond the Mediterr
nean coastsiof Africa and Asia. Turkey must
remain all crumbling as it is. Mehemet Ali
must take up his abode upon the Nile. But
go beyond the geographical mark of what is
termed civilization, and there Rnssia aay ex
ert full sway, or England, even, may rob an
empire, because it will not consume its opium.
Ru sia marches with her armies, where the
most learned of the geographical clam 6aft
scarcely follow them. England camps at
Aden, in the East. At one period, she wins a
sovreignty in New Zealand, at another is found
strg-ng with the natives of Southern Affi'ea.
What her dominion is *et, is much more, easily
ascertained, than what it is. Franceunwilling
to occupy the rear, raves and foments, and
ukes part in insurrections is South Asierna,
while at the same period, her soldiers, with
tire and sword,~are waging war FA~in-5gii.
Thus European ambition has left its former
scenes of strife and contention, its robbery of
one another, to indulge its appetites upon a
civilized nations where a greater opportalfs
offered, of retaining what it gets. Delstld&
there are designs of Providence yet wimsm&i
in this change of empire and government. Ma.
homnet established his religion by the conquer
ing power of the sword. Perhaps this power,
and this alone, can disperse it.
Civilization has never been able to obtain a
permanent footing in China, among its Inhab
itants. Under circumstances, the force of En
gland, although engaged in so poor a cause,
may be instrumental in effeeting seme-goud
end.
But there is another impressive view in the
present aspect of European afaiursiwichm is
the re-action of the West upon the East, in the
Old World. Bonaparte succeeded in breakiing
down the singularities of European States.
The force of his arrnies had a tendency to as
similate the nations upon the Continent. Be
carried Naples to Moscow, and seit Paris in
all directions. In this manner, Europe exhaus
ted itself for yours spoan itself; but it found
suich a contse, after many years of toil and
war, accompanied by great cout, without an
iotm of profit. Thus there is no longer in Eu
rope, a disposition to carry on a warimEuope.
And hence it is, that restless ambition strug
gles for other scenes of action-in the East, in
the I-lands of the Ocean, in the Americas, or
any where but at home. Thus the We.t is ot'
necessity compelled to re-act upon the East
What is to be the result of this re-action, or
what the effect, time only can determine. For
centuries past, we have beheld the East pour
ing her treasures upen the West, and thus ex
hausting her seurces, but on the controsy,.wa
now see arts, arms, and men, turning the loug
tide of time, and overwhelming the very foun
tains fromi whence they origmnated.
North Carolina-During the Iate sessionr of

The Legislature of Alabama adjourned on 4

" How Werry Pcrticlr."-The New York
Mercury says, there is an old Bachelor in that
city who is so careful of his health, that he
wraps it up every night on going to bed, in a
clean shcet of paper, with astick of Hoarhound
Candy.
Wonder if it is the same chap who refuses
to sleep with himself because he snotes ? and
hires himself out in cold nights, to get into bed
with folks?
