KNOWLEDGE is POWER.
In a late admirable report by florace
Mann, Esq., Secretary of the Board of
Education of Massachusetts, the following
striking exemplificatiou is introduced ofthe
maxim that "eknowledge is power:"
--M. Redelet, in his work -Sar'' Art de
Batir,' gives the following account of an
experiment made to test the dillerent cir
cutmstances, were necessary to move a
block of squared granite, weighing 1080
lbs.
"In order to move this block along the
foor of a roughly chiseled quarry, it re
quires a force equalio 758 lbs.
."To draw the same stone over a floor of
plank, it required a force equal to 65* lbs.
.Placed on a platform of wood, and
drawn over the sanme floor, it required 606
lby. spighe two surfaces of wood,
the requisite force was reduced t'o 182 lbs.
'Placed on rollers of three inches diam
eter, and a farce equal to 34 lbs. was suf
ficienr.
"Substituting a wooden for a stone floor,
and the requisite force was 58 Lbs,
"WVith the same mollers on a wooden
platform, It required a force equal to 22
lbs. only." '
"At this point, says Mr. Mann, the ex
periment of M. Redelet stopped. But, by
tmprovemiettsince effected in the inven
tion and use of l~oomotives on railroads,
attraction or draught, or eight pounds is
sufficient to mowe a ton of 2,240 lbs.; so
that a force of less than four pounds would
now he sufficient to move the granite bilock
ofil,oe0 lbs.; that is, one hundred add
eighty-eightttis less than was re-iuired
in the grat inatace. .When, therefore,
mere animal or musenlar force was used
to move the body, it required about two
thirds of its own weight to accomplish the
object; but, by adding the contrivances of
mind to the atiingth of muscle, the force
necessaryto move it is reduced more than
one hunmard-3andei t-eight times. Here

A!SWE BY THE EDIToIL,
The Tomato has lnig been known and
used f'or culinary purposes in many pur
tions of Europe, in France, Italy, Germa
ny. Holland, and within a few years has
become a general favourite in this coun
try.
Dr. Bennett. a medical professer in one
of our colleges. considers it an invaluable
article ofdiet. He ascribes it to high med
icinal properties, and declares.
"1st. That it (the tomato) is one of the
most powerful deotistruents of the lateria
Medica, and that in all of those affections
of the liver and other orgatns where calomnel
is indicated, it is probably the most effec
tive and least harmful remedial agent
known in the profession.
"2d. That a chemical extract tiill be
obtained from it, which will alhogether su
persede the use of calome! in the curs of
disease.
"3d. That he has succ 'fully treted
serious diarthena with this a icle alone.
"4th. That when used as an article of
diet, it-is almost a sovereign remedy (or
dyspepsia or indigestion.
"5th, That persons removing from the
east or north to the south or west, should
by all means make use ofit as an alinment,
as it would in that eve~nt save them from
the danger attendant upon those vinlent
bilious attacks to which almost all unaceli
mated persons are liable.
"6th. That the citizens in ordinast
shotld make use of it either raw, cooked,
or in the form of a eatsup, with their daily
food, as it is the most healhy. article in
the Materia Almernaria."
Professor Rafnesque, of France, says:
"It is every where deemed a healthy veg
etable, and an invaluable article of food."
Professer Dickens writes: '4 thin~k it
more wholesome than any other acid
sauce."
Professor Dungleson says: "It may the
looked upon as one of the most wholesome
and valuable esculents that tsalong to the
vegetable kingdom."
It is considered effcient in curing indl
gestion and diseases of' be liver and lungs.
A writer in the Farmer's Register says. it
has been tried by several persons, to his
knowledge, with decided suecess. 'Th'ey
were afflicted with chronic co.ugh, the
primary cause "f which in oneLjcase WaS
upposed to be diseased liver-ia another,
diseased lungs. It mItigates, and some
times effectually cheeks, a fit of coughing.
It was used in a dry state, with a little
suar mixed with .it, to render it .mnors
agreeable to the taste. The writer ax
S,.a CODnniatinn. that if freelv used ini
themselves to be exceedingly acute in each
matters, assured me after repeated tastings, i
that they could not perceive the slightest e
flavour of the turnip. The trial, therefore,
appears to be satisfactory, so far as one
experiment is concerned.
But why report the result at this season
of the year? Why, in order that you may ;
make provision for next winter, by putting C
in order a large piece of ground for ruta
bagas, immediately, manuring it well and
giving it several good harrowings to mix
-he manure well with the soil; then go to
our accommodating friend at the Roches
ter seed store and get a full supply of seed,
and put them in the groun4by the first of I
summer, and you will havdden at least i
one good action.
Remember that thorough previous cul
ture destroys the weeds and saves two
thirds of the labor of hoeing.
And that mixing manure with the soil,
thoroughly and intimately, is as important I
as the thorough mixing of the other ingro- i
dientsof the soil, and to plough in large un
broken lumps of manure and leave them
untouched, is as absurd in practice as to
mantuacture a soil of sand clay by throw
ing together large pieces of unburut bricks
and sandstote. J.

STLK IN NASsACHUSITS.
One of the most satisfactorily conducted ex
periments in the silk culture which we have
seen, was made in the family of Mr. Barton.
Gill, Mass., and reported by Mr. Colman. in
his 4th report. The management was under
the direction of Mias Barton, who not only fed
the worms but reeled she silk. Mr. Deane, the
narrator. says:-" Partly at my suggestion. the
details or this experiment were accurately not
ed. The weight of the eggs hatched was 2j oz.
The worms spun in 28 or:9days. The amount
ofleaves consumed was 2->.000 lbs. The weighat
of cocoons was 248 lbs. The weight of reeled
silk was 20lbs. i and the amount of labor was
one month; that is. the first :ialf was greaily
less than that. and the hst days something more.
The building ued was the vacant corn house.
, hich of course should nint enter into the list of i
expendituies. and the fistures were tuerly
temporary shelves of rough boards, and a few
hurdlestocontain the worms.during their three
first ages. Neither should there be any charge
for eggs. as a creat quantity were produced or
future use. The expenses therefore stand as
follows I

In this case, the cost of cultivation was less
than $2,50 per lb.; from which the state boun
ty was tso be deducted. Miss Barton was able
to reel without diticnity, oe and a half lbs. of
silk. During the three first ages. the worms
were fed with choppe leaves; during the two
last, on branches. Teworms passed each en- I
tire age without the removal of their litter.
which service was only performed immediately
afer moniting. In what ether way, we may
ask, coold a young lady make as prontabe .a,
se of her time, as was done by 'Miss B. in
feeding these industrious laborers? And we I
may hoethat such examples will be followed. I
ntil suhinstances ofrsuccessful industry shall I
not be as rare as they now unfortunately are.

'In a late number of the Louisville Journal,
wsfad an accoont of acorn crop raised by
Mr. Young. of Jemsmine co., a crop exceeding
we believe any on record in the country. The
editor says: "I Mr. Young exhibited to us a cer
tieaeof serlescabld temen, certi
fyin tht i a lt o Av acrs~h ha reduc
ed ens &gudrdd a iwindy-ehushas corn to

no doubt or the corrctnes of the estimate.
This wso apiece ofhbttomiland, and. the
committee were of opinion that Mr. You '
crop onathe upland was bettec thani tha s
was measured." Mr. Young - nI
the laditeded forcorn, ~
ither way. This land is broken up in the fall,
a the spring struck out in squares three feet
8eh way, from eight to twelve corns dropped
m each, which at the hoeing is redueed to four
talks to each hill. Asson as the corn is up,
large harrow is run over die whole ground,
aless of harrowing the corn up, which
e m happens. Nothing but de plow is used
a the cultivation; after the harrow. no boe or
:ulivator is brought to the field.-Cahisatr.
NoVEL INSTRUMENT o1 DESTAgCItoW
rp~anding Cannon Ball.-Mr. Wa -.
3eals of this city. has recently invented a
iingular and ingenious instrument of de
itrucion, which he calls the Expanding
.annon Ball. We have seen a model of
i, and though of course not at liberty to -
lescribe it, we may mention that the in
tentor is prepared to demonstrate thar it
ossesses a gower of destruction snperior
o that of any ball in use-in fact, there is
3o missile that approaches it in destructi
iility. At the moment of leaving the guA
t instantaneously expands to the extent of
hree or (our feet, and is capable of making
i hole of more than that size in the rigging
f an enemy's ship. A few of these shots
would completely cut up the rigging of a
vessel - Ad disable her. One shot could cut
lown f(ur men with the most perfect ease.
I'he Preeident. the Secretary of ibe Navy,
mnd oflicers of the Army and Navy, have
en the Expanding Cannon Ball, and ex

>ower, Mr. Beals isthe bearerof despatch
is from the Secretary ofthe Navy to Com

Mr. Beals, while at Washington, made
