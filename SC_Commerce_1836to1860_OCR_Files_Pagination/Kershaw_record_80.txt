week, it will appear in our next.
Communications sent to us for publication must

" Civi?" was received, but tor the above reason,
we cannot publish it.
| Owinsr to the sudden indisposition of the Editor,
^ur readers will excuse the original portion of
^the paper this week.
We have not received any very important commercial
news this week?every thin? relative to
commerce, North and South seem to be in a state
of lethargy.
The Weather*
We do not recollect having experienced such
dry weather at this season of the year. For five
Weeks we have not had a drop ot rain, which has
caused our streets for several days to be almost enveloped
in clouds of dust, to the great annoyance
of both man and beast. The crops of Cotton in j
the neighborhood have been already seriously injured
by it?and if we do not have rain in a few
days, will be entirely destroyed.
An affray occurred in Columbia a few evenings
ago between three men, viz: Lynch, Wilson and
Jones and several of the Students of the College,
in which Lvnch was killed.
The sum of Fifty Dollars was received by the
Building Cn ^miltee of the Baptist Church at this
place, through the hands of the Rev. Jas. Furman
as a donation from a lady of Society Hill, South
Carolina.
We have attended the Lectures of Mr. Faussf.tt
on Ventriloqiiism and Legerdemain,and was much
pleased with his expositions, which were both instructive
and amusing. Mr. Faussf.tt is a gentleman
of fine talents and highly cultivated mind.

The Editor of the Macon Telegraph,
makes the following remark, which cocides
with our opinion of the Cotton
and Specie Markets.
"Nothing will save the country, but a '
planting of less cotton and More corn.
If as much cotton is made this year as
last, it will not be worth next fall 3 cents
a pound! and if as many hogs* mules,
horses, &.c. &c. are purchased from
abroad as usual, all our money will he
carried out, and the State will be bankrunt!"
Th is the following latest information We
have received from New York.
Thursday, I*. M.
City News ?This is the gloomiest day we
have ever witnessed in this city?the number
of failures, yesterday, being greater than
any day yet. Some of our staunchest and
best houses went down. The amount of
indebtedness of those that stopped yesterday
afternoon, is about eight millions. Confidence
has apparently vanished. The Banks
do all they can?they generally renew all
paper that is required to be renewed, and i
without additional names. Stocks have again j

was also the topic or conversation.
At 5 o'clock the Mechanics' Bank Closed,
having kept open two hours later than usUal

The committee appointed by the Merchants
to visit Washington, for the purpose
of calling on the President to afford

We learn that the following is

lie would repeal the Specie Circular, and
that he would call Congress together, he

Georgia Rail Road.?We witnessod on
\ Saturday afternoon last, with feelings of
I pleasure gratification and pride, the start
on the Georgia Rail Road, of the first locomotive,
that was ever put in motion on the |
soil of Georgia. With pleasure, because
we saw realized the expectations we always
entertained of the energy, industry, and
ability with which the road would be commenced
and prosecuted, and will be completed.
With gratification, because the first
attempt of Georgia to use Rail Roads, as a
afe and expeditious mode of intercommunication,
must inevitably produce the most
beneficial results, not only to the Stockholders
hut to the State of Georgia. With
pride, because we will be able hereafter to
challenge any other Stale of the union, to
show such & perfect work of internal
improvement, and because it would ho
a lasting monument of the industry and resources
of Georgia. This locomotive, whose
name is "Georgia," started beautifully and
majestically from the Depository, and following
the impulse given, flew with surprising
velocity on the road which hereafter
is to bo her natural element, taking under
her care and protection, and conveying and
towing inmncrahle cars loaded with passengers,
produce and merchandize, for other
sections of our State, and for the far distant

And yesterday morning two locomotives, (
the Georgia and Pennsylvania, started with
cars from the depository. Many of our
citizens and ladies availed themselves of the
opportunity, to enjoy a trip to the country, (
and returned highly gratified at the prospect
of the Complete success of the road. Our
citizens were also gratified at the courtesy J
of, and accommodations afforded them by ,
the gentlemen connected with the Depository.
The distance from the city completed with

Your obedient servant,

Dublin, January 2, 1H37.
To the People of the U. States
It is well known to the people of America,
and to mankind in general, with :
single exception, that the great end and
aim of ail my political rn: no uvering is
the destruction of the monopolising power
of (ireat Britain. To ell'ect this, a
great deal of lime is necessary, indeed, I
can only hope to see the beginning of ii.
But on the American rest my hope.?
The rising generation of the United Statemay
not only be the beholders, but tin
conductors of this destiny; and the tino
has arrived when this n ighty work for
the preservation of nations should commence,
If it does not commence now,

That power? that tremendous power?
which has duped and enslaved a third of
the inhabitants of the earth, has another
stupendous enterprise on foot, to brine
the moat respectable nations on the facof
the ear h, to the footstool of British
tyranny, for privale?jes which the United
States at least, should never sutler them
to have the power of granting.
Americans, Great Britain is not satisfied
witli her encroachments upon Hindustan,

her possessions in North A

commercial concerns.
She is about to declare war against th
ttepublic of Columbia, on what gronn
she hardly knows, but for what purpo*
the whole world ought to know. Th
grand consequence which is to procc
from the conquest of Columbia, is the
making of a great ship canal through the
Isthmus of Darien, and the establishmen
of another Gibralter, to compel the nation
of the earth to beg a permit to the
Pacific Ocean. Will this tremendous enterprize
produce no consequences which
America may look upon without jealousy
and apprehension? Depend upon it,
Americans,as sure as my hopes and dibi ts
arc disappointed and defeated by your regardlessness,
so sure the gh>r\ of your
country is circumscribed forever. And
what is liberty itself without national'
glory. What is a nation without the ho- j
mage and admiration of mankim I? Do |
you not already feel that you are far, veryfar,
from having arrived at the elevation
which the genius of your government
and institutions is capable of raising you
to? I am sure you do. Then hegin to act.
Your means arc superabundant: Mexico
j has given you sufficient cause to wage
| war against her. Shove her out of y??ur
way and go to work. The cutting of a
canal through the Isthmus of Panama
will lessen your surplus revenue, preserve
the several States from squuhling about
it, and confer an honor on your nation.
Mankind will justly acknowledge it to?be
the most noble, stupendous work ever effected
by a nation. And when you con
j aider that there is nothing to prevent yon
I from effecting this grand object hut your
delicacy in making a conquest of Mexico,
you are also to consider that such a conquest
would not only he jnslified before
the world by the events which has occuri
red between the United States and her,
but would be vastly productive of good
even to the conquered. The Mexicans
could live much happier under the protection
of the Federal Government of the
United S. It ought to be a maxim with
nations, that a design which is productive
of more good than evil, should be prosecuted.
Suffer Great Britain to accomplish this
design and what would be the consequences
i:i peace or war? You may conceive
the humiliation and degradation that all
ruber civilized nations would be reduced to(
in a pcriou of peace ; but in a time of war,
you may strive to imagine the advantages of
that pass to the Pacific in the hands of your
enemy; but your imagination will fail you?
the evil consi>t|itences of such an event to a
neighboring commercial nation, I will not
predict. Americans, Brotiprs in love of
iberty, I implore you not to snffer this enemy
of human liberty and human happiness,
his aspirant to the donr.iniou of the globe,
his plunderer of mankind, to perpetuate
'tor existence at the future expense of all
>tIter civilized nations.
Your ever faithful servant,
DANIEL O'CONNEL.
Magnetism.?The following remarks up-1
on the energy \ind increase of magnetic 1
power are by professor &il!iman. It appears
that the power generated by clectrornnguetism
may be indefinitely prolonged?
lhat the power may be increased beyond any
limit hitherto attained, and probably beyond
any which can l>e with certainty assigned.
"As electro-magnetism has been experimentally
proved to be sufficient to raise and
sustain several thousands of pounds, no;
reason can be discovered why, when the i
acting surfaces are by skilful mechanism 1
brought as near as possible without contact, ,
the continued exertion of the power should
not generate a continued rotary movement
of a degree of energy inferior indeed to lhat
exerted in actual contact but still merely approximating
to it.
"As the power can be generated cheaply
and certainly?as it can be continued iudefiII

by very simple moans??s we have no hnowlodge
of its limit, and may therefore presume
on an indefinite augmentation of its
energy, it is much to he desired that the
investigation should he prosecuted with *eal

mechanical skill and hy ample funds.

placed in our hands a new power of great

To the Citizens.
rjHHE Camden Independent Fire Engine Com
pany, having, by experience, found that the
Erigiile under their cbntrol failed to answer the
purpose for which they were organized, in its being
of a construction that rendered it heavy and
difficult to work; felt themselves warranted in the
appointing of a committee for the purpose of soliciting
Subscriptions for the purchase ot one of a
mora modern form.
This committee, in their report at the annual
meeting, which occurred on the 8th inst., state,
that after an assiduous attention to the duties assigned,
they have only been able to obtain the sum
of $454, including a donation of $50 from the
Fire and \iarine Insurance Company at Charleston
: that they totally failed, in an application made
to the town authorities : who, on consideration,
deemed it unadviseable to make an appropriation
from the town fund, although they wore aware
that a necessity exists of another Efigine being
added to the town.
The committee appointed in May last, to ascertain
the probable cost of a suitable Engine in N
York, stated, that the whole expense might be put
down at ?which shows that the company is
now deficient in the sum of $350, to effect the object
in view
Afler the reading of the Report the following
resolution was submitted and passed.
RESOLVED, ''That the Capt. elected, for the!
succeeding verir,bc authorized to publish an appeal
to the citizens, of the facts, and that the list remain
open until the second Monday in June., to which !
time this meeting will stand adjourned, when, if j
I the deficient amount for the purchase of a new I
Engine be hot subscribed, the company will forth- !
with be d'mhftiided:"
In exposition of the facts, L have, in fulfilment
I of this duty, but a tew remarks to inake?for 1 am
pursuaded it is only necessary to make known the
circumstance?aa not a citizen who keels for the
| interest of the town will require urging.
The town has at present but two Engines, both
of which aie hardly deserving of the name?therefore
every citizen shbdld not only feel, but exhibit J
a warmth of interestirt an undertaking which will'
enable an efficient and organized company to contend
with the fiery element in an hour of danger.
The advantage of good Engines is not a matter of
experiment with this community, as unfortunately,
demonstrative proof has shfewn
Should ^fecess attend the etfort, the funds will
! be collected when the Engine arrives ; probably
about the 1st November?those, therefore, who are
in tavor of the object, will testify it by their names,
if opposed by their sii.enck. The list will be
found at my place of business. . A. BURR.,
