analysis $, gknats proceedings.
Monday, January 9,13i2.
After a variety of slighter matters, the detail of
which will be found in another column, the Sonde
returned to the bill providing for the occupation
of the Oregon Territory; u{>on which a debate
of some interest and importance ensued,
opened by the Senator who had desired the delay
of the bill that lie might have time to examine its
provisions.
Mr. Calhoun was glad (he said) to learn from
he Senator reporting it that the bill was not
designed to contravene our conventions with .
Great Britain. He had now taken time carefully
to compare it with our subsisting engagements to
that power; and the result of his scrutiny was,
that there was one provision in it which woulJ
completely violate those engagements.
The Senator proceeded to give, with his usual
power of analysis, a summary of the allcdgcd
rights of both parties to the territory, and of the
manner in which those rights are claimed to have
arisen. Our claim embraces the coast of the
Pacific from latitude 51 dg. 40 min. to 10 dg.;
and has three several grounds:
1st. That of the priority of discovery by Captain
Gray, of Boston, in 1788, of the mouth of
the Columbia, t rorn this, according to the universal
rule among civilized nations, follows the
right to the country watered by such river to its
sources. This discovery was afterwards more
completely explored by the exj>cdition under the
command of Captains Lewis and Clarke.
2d. The cession by Spain of all her rights of
territory north of the 42d parallel of latitude.
3d. The Trench claim, to which we succeeded. I
On the other hand, Britain sets up her title to i
the same territory on the following grounds :
1st. That they can plead priority of discovery
by ."Vicars, sailing under Vancouver.
2d. That, by the convention of Njotka Sound i
in 1793, Spain yielded to Great Britain free and
open access, trade and settlement to British sub.
jeets, in common with her own, upon this coast.
3d. They claim also the French rights, ceded
to Spain in 1863 by treaty between those two nations.
These were respectively the grounds, of claim.
Now, as to the nature of the claims themselves,
there was a difference. Great Britain alleged only
a right of equal admittance of her citizens for all
purposes of settlement, trade, or hunting; while
we asserted a title to complete and exclusive possession.
Since this conflict of titles began, various efforts
by negotiation have been made amicably to adjust
our rights. They terminated, on our part, in an
offer of fixing, as a compromise, the parallel of
49 dg. as the limit between us ou that coast ; and
they on their part, offered to claim nothing south
of the mouth of the Columbia, which is in about
latitude 46 dg.
This last attempt failing, both sides withdrew
the propositions which they had made, and left
their rights as before.
In 1817, by a fresh negociation, it was settled
that our respective claims should for ten years remain
on the ground on which the treaty of Nootka
Sound placed Britain and Spain with regard to
the same territory ; that is, common enjoyment of
it for purposes of trade and hunting, or settlement
for those purposes.
In 1827 a fresh attempt, conducted by Mr.
Gallatin, was made to adjust this conflict of
claims. It was again ineffectual, and the parties
returned, as a temporary arrangement, to the convention
of 1817, yielding each other possession in
common, with liberty to renounce the arrangeincnton
either part upon a year's notice.
It thus appears that Great Britain makes no
claim to the right of colonizing, and that we, by
the convention, have prohibited ourselves from
taking exclusive possession or jurisdiction.
Such being either the original rights of the partics,
or the footing upon which, bjtrcaty, they
had consented to have tlicm stand, the Senator
must (he said) hold that this bill violates the treaty
of 1827, by conferring upon our citizens fixed possession
in grants of Jand. Wc do not, il is true,
at once confer it, but wc bind ourselves to do so.
Butting them in possession with this pledge on our
part, wc in reality t.ikc fixed possession ourselves.
It is a grant forming a complete reality as to our
assuming po6soos;on. The grant of lands is the
highest and completes! act of possession which a
sovereign can perform.
But since the claim which wc set up extends
nothward to latitude 54 dg., and since, by this act,
we limit the settlers whom wc invite only by our
own alleged territory, it follows that you, by this
bill, take possession up to the extreme northern
extent of your supposed claim: so that you exelude
Great Britain, by this act, from the whole
territory in debate with that Government. To
this full extent, the bill is a complete taking of i
possession.
Now if, on the other hand, you scrutinize the 1
British acts, you will find that they have nothing i
?f equal extent or force. Their act of Parliament
as not to take possession of the country, or grant ]
its soil, but te extend to British subjects there the i
jurisdiction of their laws. 1
Mr. Calhoun, therefore, went on to contend
that we should violate the subsisting convention, I
if, without giving Uie year's notice, to which it I
binds us, we should put in force an act like this. I
He went on to insist upon the formidable issue to 1
which such a course must bring us with a nation eve- t
ry where dangerous to encounter, and more than a c
match for us on this distant coast, accessible to i
our arms only by a land-march across the conti- t
ncnt, while she pan command it, not only from I t
those Asiatic possessions where she has of late f
been so successful, but with her bodies of Canadi- 1
an voyagerp, themselves hardy and dangerous, but 1
an nnhnnndfid influence over all the In- c
Him races of the northwest. With these to cut j e
hFour communications in tlse rear, the difficulties : t
of any hostile effort overland would be to the last c
decree formidable. f
He would, then pursue a juster and surer policy: t
not .rush into a contest of which the event could v
scarcely *? auspicious; but leave to time and the !i
rapid march ot cur settlements the peaceful hut j
n,,f/.rp?mpnl r.r our rights. Leave the thin^ ti
V/tl iUIti VlMV?vv?v..v 0 o
to its own natural season, and, by-and.by, you h
iniy as easily as one plucks a ripe pcacli gather v
what now it would be hardly pp:sible to tear o
away. I?ct us (said the Senator) recall a little v
the vast and rapid sweep of that population which s<
we carry on, and you will see whether there is any ! ji
extravagance in that on which I insist. Remem ! b
her that eighteen years ago Mr. Monroe rccom. J tl
mended to colon'ae the Indian tribes between the j
Ohio and Ml&hssipri. where i i
of Wisconsin, fc-jtilc, cultivated, and populous tli
enough speedily to add another State to the pr
Union. I al
lie could not. from such a step as this, but ap-! ot
prehend a breach with Great Britain. We should, ' cc
at least, weigh the matter, in an us lorms, wiui si
the utmost deliberation. lie thought it should be (i
referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations. K
As to every thing else but the provision in ques- d<
tion, he looked 011 the bill m?-st favorably; and 1 tl:
spoke with a complete resolution to maintain all ; c<
our rights over the territory, which could be exer- m
cised in conformity with the treaty. n<
Mr. Linn said that the .Senator had, with great tl
force and truth, compared the mighty flow of i fr
population westward to the rolling in of a great ! pi
and wide stream. But he should remember that | pi
the policy of the Government itself has of late, in | rc
the disposition made of many of the greater Indian ci
tribes, raised up artificial barriers, which have at
present stopped that natural spread of population, it
On the South and the Southwest it has reached h
our limits. This outlet of the West must be open- w
ed, or it will break across the bounds within which 1 h
we have pledged ourselves that the expatriated ci
Indian tribes shall dwell securely. The Oregon a
region must be opened to the adventurous and si
migratory spirit of our people, or the collected o
flood must scon burst orer, and sweep away the h
Indian, to whom we have pledged ourselves an p
undisturbed refuge in the home to which we have,
by so humane a policy, transplanted him. p
Tire Senator regards this bill as going new and ii
dangerous lengths. Yet the bills introduced with g
the same object, long since, under Mr. Monroe and H
Mr. Adams, by Gen. Floyd, were far stronger.? tl
They provided for the erecting forts and custom, a
houses. As for that formidable and perpetual im- v
pediment, the treaty, it existed then just as much ii
as now. s
Adverting then to the English claims, as foun- t<
ded on alleged discovery, Mr. Linn treated the ii
pretended visit of Mears and others to the mouth o
of the Columbia as altogether preposterous. The j
narrative itself, which describes a region bound up f<
in ribs of ice in the month of June, makes it im. a
possible for any one now to believe that Mcars's t
visit was to the Columbia?a coast never witness,
ing such regions of cold, even in mid.wintcr, and o
enjoying a soft temperature even in the curlier r
spring. ti
But, in truth, this whole British claim is recent.
It was never heard ofc as against the discovery of v
Capt. Gray or the explorations of Lewis and g
Clarke. As late as lbl2, the question of our dis. v
covery was minutely examined in one of the I
leading British authorities on such questions, the t
Edinbu-gh Review, and our claim admitted as in- ii
controvct title.
As to what England may urge of the Nootka d
Sound treaty with Spain, it is snlficient to say that b
any such claim must have fallen with that treaty o
itsclr, temjwrary in its character, and speedily h
dissolved by the war which cccurrcd between the ti
two countries soon alter, uur rigiu ne piacco on e
the strong and certain ground of discovery. s
The Senator from South Carolina had urged g
that we should, first of all, give the twelve months' a
notice of our renunciation of the treaty. lie could
only answer that he himself had repeatedly urged s
that course in former years, but always in vain.? | ?:
He had ever been met with the answer: " This is I &
not the proper time?wait." Meanwhile the ad- n
verse English possession was going on, fortifying, ic
from year to year, the British claim and the Brit- ti
ish resources to make it good. Two successive s<
Presidents had encouraged the bold and well-ar- a;
ranged si heme of Astor to fortify and to colonize, m
But we suffered him to be dispossessed, and the 1?
nuclous of empire, which his establishments si
would have formed, to pass into the hands cj
of the Hudson Bay Company, now the great in- w
strumcnt of all the British scheme of possession. ry
The Senator insists that, by the treaty, there fl<
should be a joint possession. Be it so, if he will: fo
but where is our part of this joint possession ? In bi
what docs it consist or has it consisted ? Wc have fr<
no post there, no agent, nobody to protect traders j p*
?nay, in truth, no traders: for they are butchered i tc
as soon as they appear there, cither by the British Si
agents, or those savages whom they can always
make the instruments of such systematic massacre \v
' "* ?(\C tKn C 4UnL<A n f
01 auvitiiuruus uvuid. vi taiuu wi mtov vi
murders, cr of the regularity with which they were cc
employed, the Senator had probably but little notion.
He could assure him that, before the year sa
1859, there had perished in this war, as was well ! in
ascertained, full five hundred men, and the yearly j fo
slaughter has gone on ever since. i til
But what has ever been the history of your su
peopling of these distant regions, always to be dis. th
putcd with something which this Government G
shrinks from encountering? You have never hi
failed to turn your back upon every such hardy bl
enterprise. The very navigation of the Mississip.
pi, for forty years, would have been yielded to fo
Great Britain but that it required the assent of in
nine States to bring it into the validity of a treaty, j hi
Six Eastern States were ready to abandon it for J th
an interest the most wretchedly disproportionate. Jt
If that mighty access to a new and greater em. j foi
pirc of the West has been preserved to you. it is ! be
in spite of your supinencss, in spite of your timid:- ' eh
ty, in spite of your impolicy. ' ly
As for me (said Mr. L.) I desire in this irresUti. ; pa
blc advance of our population, destined to carry to I ry
the very verge tf the continent the benefi's of our ! po
"rec laws, to march with every public right in the vi<
cad, while we carry to those regions of barbarism an
.he Bible and the plough-share. And I would tin
:vcn in these great purposes, halt rather than to it,
nolate our national faith solemnly pledged in a tin
rcaty. But I tell the Senator that we cannot to
bus ritridlv adhere to what our rival so little re- j jn<
jurds. That Senator docs not know, or has over, ni;
ooked, tiie progress which British possession has
>ccn for twenty years making against us, under bri
rover of the Hudson Bay Company, the irrespon- by
fibie instrument of British power in tliat quarter, tcr
>y means of which wc and this treaty arc steadily le^
:ircumvented. There, as in the East, Britain sU:
rcparcsher way to unchecked dominion through Nc
lie stealthy advance of tluse trading companies, Sp
I'hich scatter the seeds that are to spring up into a tia
larvest of power for her. # in
Finally, he insisted that the bill docs not attempt t
a dispossess Great Britain of any thing she now "c
olds. It does not define our territory. That Sp
re have some there is certain. Can she object to at
ur settling south of the Columbia on a territory to p0i
ihich, with all her facility of c laiming, she has }1U
rt Ui> no title ? She herself has extended her | bin
jrisdiction oyer Oregon, built forts, set up csta- ]
lishmcn's, settled farms. YS'liy cannot we do dis
lie same ? |>oi
Mr. Choalc rose next. Ife sol out with express- co,
lg his regret at finding himself eompeiltd, like
ic Senator from South Carolina, to oppose the
ovision in the bill for fixed grants of land. In
I other particulars, he was was warmly in favor
the bill. He went on to cite the words of our
invention with Great Britain in 1818, which
ipulatcd that " any country west of the Stony
locky) Mountains shall be free to both nations."
either Government was, as a Government, to
) any thing to divest the citizens of the other of
te enjoyment of the common freedom of that
)untry. Certainly if wandering subjects of either
lade, at their own risk, establishments there,
either was called on to interfere. But we, by
lis bill, do an act to hinder some part of this tract
om being any longer open, except to our own
roplc. We take and are to maintain exclusive
ossession, guarantying to settlers, after five years'
sidcncc, a fee simple of the lands they may ocupy.
Mr. C. here entered into a minute view of one
itf rpretation of the treaty, which might at first
ave seemed possible?that either Government
'us to be at liberty to invite colonization. As,
owever, no such view was advanced on the othr
side as warranting our measures of occupation,
nd as Mr. C. certainly showed how little any
jch purpose could have entered into the treaty,
r was practicable in itself, we need not follow
is very skilful and elaborate argument on that
oint.
He went on to urge that there had been no apropriation
of territory unt'l 1832, tbe country beig
freely used, on both parts only as a huntinground
; that the language of our own envoys,
dessre. Gallatin and Rush, made it clear that
hey regarded all occupation of the country for
ny purpose more fixed, as prohibited by the conention;
that England has been equally guarded
i the sort of possession which 6hc allowed her
ubjecls to derive from her, limiting her licenses
j them, always to the right of hunting, and guardlg
even in such licenses against all exclusion of
ur citizens.
The Senator from South Carolina was thereare
right; our legislation (if we pass such a bill
s this) will not compare, injustice and faith, with,
hat of Great Britain.
Let us then build forts; that is permitted by
ur engagements; and as England sends her juisdiction
thither to her citizens, let us send ours
o our own.
Mr. Lina answered briefly that the gentleman
i?as but reviving against land-granta, the \ery arutnents
used in 1821 against vshut he was now
rilling to admit, the erection of lorts. But the
Intish Government, as a Government, has never
milt a fort there. Will it not object to our doing
.7
Mr. L. then gave vent to something of that inignation
with which lie often speaks of the overearing
and grasping spirit of England, and the
mnipotcnce and ubiquity of that little island. For
is part, he did not intend to submit our rights cnircly
to the view which she might, in her policy,
akc of them. He did not intend to stop b conidcr
" what Mrs. Grundy thinks." He would
o as far as Great Britain herself went, anl then
little farther.
At this moment she is doing, through her Iludan
Bay Company, all that you wish not to do.
;hc is there employing the same policy and the
amc mechanism, of a great trading company, by
leans of which she made her way to the dornin>n
of all India. She has already, practically
iken possession of all she ever c.aimed of u.?,
iiithward to the mouth of the Columbia. Her
gents here have directly avowed that she could
at give up the establishments which she has aimed
iier people to form there. Her later mcaires,
however, arc still more decisive of her polij.
A branch of her Hudson Bay Company lias,
itliin a few years, been established in the tcrrito
for farming purposc*-a settlement already so
jurishing as to have entered into large contracts
r supplying the Russian possessions with lumber,
itter, and such produce. Here is her fixed point,
am which she is to work the lever of her looser
>pulation, spreading itself out over your whole
rritory, and reaching to the very borders of your latcs
themselves.
Mr. McRobcrts considered the provision to
liicli the Senators objected as a capital feature
' the bill. Citizens could not be carried to the ,
?untr' without the inducements there held out.
But the Senators from South Carolina and Mas- ,
chusctts have considered Great Britain as ofler- ,
g us, in her conduct, an example of scrupulous ,
rbearancc to do any thing in contravention of. |
c subsisting treaty. Now, let the Senators con- |
lit the correspondence of .Mr. Huskisson, and j
ey will there find that he plainly says that
real Britain bae authorised the settlements which j
ive l?ccn made, the posts which have been csta- .
ished, and that both will be protected.
The Senator proceeded to argue, with much
rcc, that since the formation of the convention
which this territory was looked on as a common
inting-ground, an entirely different state of
ings had, by our long supincness, come about.?
was a hunting-ground no longer. The game (
rmerly pursued there for the sake of its furs has" t
en, bv degrees, almost exterminated; and its x
a*> no longer warrants the settleme nts originalmade
for that purpose. Another mode of occunrr,
with Other cbjecfc, and looking to station^
employments, has graduni-y eome about. T.:'j. ,
sscss'.on now maintained by the English is ob- t
iusly of a fixed character, because its purpose*^ ,
; no longer hunting and fishing, as of old, when ,
3 convention was made. If they now occupy \
it cannot be for the purposes of the chase, for t
i plain reason that the chase there lias ceased ^
be valuable. Vet their settlements arc grow
t, just in proportion as the chase of the furani- 1
jls declines.
The Senator from South Carolina has given a i
of view of the several modes of claim alleged (
ourselves and Great Britain in regard to this j
ritory. But let him look, not to the vague al- f
ations of right, but to such claims as can be
>tained in the mutual scrutiny of a negotiation, j
>w, as to the rights which Britain derives from /
ain. Mr. Iluskisson writes, in 1826, in the ncgotion
with Mr. Adams, "The rights of Britain
c
that quarter arc defined hy the treaty of 1790
th Spainand they embrace (he further says) ^
very thing lying north of the places occupied by ^
aiu in 1789." Now, it is perfectly certain that,
the time in question, Sp.iin had occupied no j .
nt south of Nootka Sound; which is full three J
ndrcd inilts north of the mouth of the Colum- i
r
I n
Nor was it ditlicnlt to show that her claim of
covcrv was equally untenable. Who, upon that
nt, can he a more decisive witness than Vanivor
himself, the commander whose subordinate,
ears,) is claimed a? the discove.'er. Vancouver, a
i his Journal, in 1792, distinctly admits Cap. i
tin Cray to have made the prior discovery of thu j
louth of the Columbia, which he himself had for
>mc time completely discredited.
Reciting, then, the words of the convention, (
Ir. McR. proceeded to argue that they would give |
ireat Britain no reason to complain so long as
cither party attempted to dispossess the other.?
>o man would be able, under this bill, to go upon
jc farm of a British citizen and appropriate it.
In truth, Great Britain has for ten years done
II that you now propose to do. Hitherto we
avc slept over our rights, while she has been vigir
tnt aud active. Let notice now be given that we I
mounce the convention of 1818. It will be a
ill twelvemonth before our citizens can get thithr:
the Executive will of course in the interval
ivc the proper notice to Great Britain.
But, in reality, this bill will embrace every inubitant
of the country, whether British or Arner. :
jan. It can therefore dispossess nobody. Nor, j
n the other hand, do titles arise under it before j
ic expiration of five years.
As to the enormous display of strength, which '
re arc told that she will make in that quarter, 1 !
ee no probability of any such gigantic effort.? ;
Two facts render it most unlikely: in the first;
lace, there is little or nothing there to fight for; j
nd in the second, we shall have nobody there for j
er to fight.
Mr. Henderson, of Mississippi, succeeded Mr. 1
dc Roberts, in a short but exceedingly well-argued :
ptech, principally on the question of mutual posession
and rights under the convention.
He urged that the act of Great Britain in exending
her jurisdiction over the country was a ;
cut and practical taking of possession.
Mr. Choale here interposed. Great Britain but !
ut in practice by her law her rights over her own '
itizens, and assumed nothing else.
Mr. Henderson resumed. Suppose, then, a case
rhcre one of our citizens commits an assault on a
Iritish inhabitant, will he not be seized and tried
ieforc a British magistrate ? Can you doubt it ?
so, her act of extending her jurisdiction over her
wn subjects must cither imply the alscncc of any
uch legal equality on our part?in which case
he takes legal control and jurisdiction over our
itizens?or else it implies that wo too have tribulals
there, asserting our rights of jurisdiction;
rhich latter state of things is at once a conflict of (
urisdictions, incapable of being reconciled. Forts
vc might exclusively occupy ; but it would "be necssary
to beware of going out of them?for who.
I oKr-rt-.#! minlit frill within British iu- !
Vti niC|/|/V,U Ul/.VrfU KU^M* ^
isdiotion or encounter a British subject.
It was clear that the convention looked to no
uch state of things, and provided only for a free
radc of both parties to the territory. The acts of
he Hudson Bay Company must too, be held those
f the British Government. Its possession is her
ossession Her setting up a legal jurisdiction iin- '
lies that she takes possession of the country unless i
re do the same. On our taking that step, a con- j
Lict of jurisdiction ensues, which must at once ]
oinpcl the adjustment of our final claims of right,
ihe has asserted her right by these steps of posrssion.
We must do the same; and, by this bill,
re are going no faster than she.
Mr. Bayard here proposed a modified provision !
s to grants of land. But, before any further pro. J
ceding, the Senate adjourned. j

The Loudon correspondent of the New *
York Journal of Commerce says that some
gentleman has been devoting twenty *
years of his life to the inventions, where- *
by he is now enabled, by a variety of ma- | '

A curious thing occurred in Philadel-j v
ftliia, a few days since. A young woman 1
actually pawned "a baby." and got two n
lollars on this * pledge" of love. The j
infant was so enveloped that the pawnbroker
took it for a roll of linen. He a p. J c
died afterwards with the child to the ?
o
guardians of the poor, but they refined t
have any thing to do with it until the fix ?r
months are up, for which it is pledged.
Comfort.?People's ideas of comfort
vary. A celebrated hangman in England,
showing the gallows attached to
Newgate, observed to the foy-standersthat
lie had hung twenty persona on it at one
time! Some one suggested that it wa*
ton small. * Oh, no! bless your honor,"f
said the hangman, * twenty-five people
could swing oh that gallows, comfortably.

of parents one being African nnd the other
Caucasian or white, are decidedly the
shortest lived of the human race.
