shbep, confining them on it by means of
a temporary fencing or hurdles; cattle
are not liable to become hoven while feed*
ing it in any state of its growth; on
good land it has been known to reach
the height of three feet and even more,
producing as much as 12 tons of green
food per acre, which, when welt dried,
will yield 3 tons of the most valuable hay
on the farm.?The first sowing takes
place as soon after harvest as possible
in England, upon land designed for
the wheat-crop the next autumn, with the
winter variety of seed, which can easily
be distinguished from the summer tare, as
it is smaller, rounder, and blacker; these
will bear the severity of the winter; rye
is often mixed to enable the crop to stand
up, when it attains a considerable height,
but a sprinklingof wheat has been found
best for this purpose, as it remains longer
succulent in the summer. The crop
from this sowing will he fit for cutting for
soiling in May, and the stalks if left in
the ground will afford a second growth for
sheep-feed ; but as the tare is a fallow
crop, it is the best management to cut all
off and plough the lanu deep as soon as
the crop is removed, well working it and
cleaning it during the summer, preparatory
to wheat-sowing, early in the autumn
after a dressing of well prepared compost,)
if this has not been given to the tares?
a far better arrangement for bo'h crops.
The next sowing is with rhe summer var
iety of the tare, as ear!) in March as the
season will admit, on land that has hcen
ploughed preparatory in the autumn or
winter; again in April another crop is
sown, and, if necessary, two other sowings
might take place, the last so late as
the end of June, that so a succession of
this most valuable crop might be secured
forth whole of the summer, and until
the of September, Such crops produce
immense qua-mti* so'*m "uire, which

ing in the au juin. It must not be forgotten
that the richer the land, the greater
will be the crop of tares, and none
will pay so amply for manure; but
when the crop is very heavy, there is. less
chance of obtaining good seed, and if
that be the object, it is recommended to
mow the first crop early for soiling, and
permit the second growth to stand for
seed, which is sometimes a precarious
business, nothing being more uncertain; I
have purchased seed at a guinea and a
half, a bushel, and sold the next year's
produce obtained from it at six shillings
a bushel! When the price of seed is moderate,
the quantity sown is two bushels
or two and a half per acre, but whatever
the price may be, it will be repaid in the
crop, if the land be in good heart. As
much as SO bushels ef seed per acre has
been obtained, but 15 bushels, and often
half that, is more common Under a
heavy crop of tares, the land will be found
perfectly clean and mellow, and will turn

With regard to the value of the tare for
soiling, it had been calculated that ten
times more stock might be kept on them
than on any other commonly cultivated

the Tare culture.
At a late meeting of the Philadelphia
Agricultural Society, a member enquired
if any one present could speak experiment,
ally on the culture and value of the tare
or vetch, which is in such very general
use in England, where the summer.oil.
ijrgs system is adopted ; remarking, that
from all accounts the plants must be as*
^ tenishingly productive as well a9 nutritioas.
Having myself employed it for that
purpose very largely, and for many years,
( would say, its productiveness has never
pet bean overstated, or its value overra'
ted, as food for all kinds of cattle. Hor.
ses, milk cows, fatting beasts, sheep and
hogs, will grow fat while feeding on it,
and the older it grows the more valuable
it becomes, as the seed when formed in
the pod, is far superior to oats or any other
grain for the purpose of cattle feed ;
the seeds are black, and the size of very
small peas. The crop is used for soiling
by cutting while green and taking it to
thestahles; it is sometimes fed off by
feeding on them than on any other food
whatever. It is not strange, that no tegular
experiment on an extensive scale has
yet been made on such an invaluable crop
in this country ?
Broken Wind in Horses.
A great number of dessections have
proved that the cause of this disease is a
rupture of the air vessel iu the lungs.?
The difficulty of breathing which some
person experience after unusual or pro.
longed effort, would seem to arise from the
same cause, and there is some reason to
think that the disease may be hereditary.
This is an important suggestion, so far as
the human race is concerned.
"Dr. Jackson found that of *28 persons
affected with this rupture of the air cells,
18 were the offspring of parents (fathers
or mothers) affected with the same disease,
and that several of them had died
from this cause. In some instances the
brothers and sisters of these persons were
similarly affected. On the other hand
of 50 persons unaffected with the disease,
three only were the offspring of parents
who had suffered from it; whence it fol.
lows that rupture of the air cells of the
lungs is frequently a hereditary disease ;
a fact important to man and horse, at all
events to the breeder of the latter.

importance of agriculture.
As a practical art, involving necessari.
ly the existence of all other arts, and di.
rectly the uses and aids of many of them,
the importance of the agricultural art
cannot be over estimated. In an eco.
nomical and political view with the ex.
ceptionofthe intellectual and moral interests
of the community, which are also
ir some, degree in obeyance to it, it is
oliviously by far the most important of all
its interests,?the department of its industry
which most deserves the attention
of the patriot, the philosopher, and the
philanthropist, as the means of subsistence,
and comfort, and the foundation of
national wealth. Extensive as are the
commercial enterprise and the manufacturinff
industrv of Great Britain, vet her
O J ' ?
agricultural interests far transcend them.
In France, more than one hundred and
twenty million pounds of sugar are annually
produced from the soil, where, little
more than thirty years since, not a pound
was grown; to say nothing of products
in silk and wine, which are in proportion.
I It is easy to see what a stake she has in
' agriculture. In China, a nation almost
exclusively agricultural, for her various
manufactures are mainly concerned in
the products of her agriculture, where,
besides her vast exports, more than three
hundred and thirty millions of people are
subsisted upon these products, we gather
some impression of the immense importance
of this art. There, likewise, the
art has been carried to a higher perfection
than in any other part of the world.
Among ourselves it would be vain, in the
present youth of the country, to attempt
to calculate the extent to which the art
is destined to he carried. The forthcoming
census of its agricultural products
will exhibit results, which will excite
universal surprise. An annual crop in
the Southern States, of more than 2,000,000
bales of cotton, of 249,000,000
pounds of sugar in Louisiana, of 42,000000
bushels ot Indian corn in Tennessee,
of 18,000,000 bushels of wheat in Ohio,
and more than 10,000,000 pounds of maple
sugar in New York, great as the results
appear, are yet only the steps in the progress
of this gigantic interest.
These facts show how essentially agriculture
concerns the condition of the
whole country. This interest, likewise,
is certain to increase in an equal ratio
with the growth of her population; and
iet her commerce be ever so extended, or
ner rnanuiactures as numerous and improved
as invention and s'.i ! and art can
make them, yet they must always he sub
sidiary to her agriculture. It is her ag.
riculture which freightsthe barks of com.
merce, and drives the wheels and spindles
of her manufactories in their rapid and
infinite gyations. At her breasts; without
a single exception, the whole of the
human family are to be sustained, nour.
ished, and comforted.
The perfection of agriculture, as an
art, implies the obtaining the greatest
amount of produce from the earth, with
the least injury to the land, and at cost of
labor. It has been often remarked, that
the actual productive powers of an acre
of land have never yet been reached.?
Magnificent and surprising results have
been attained, but in no case can it be
> :_l*
said, with conhdence, tnai more migm
not have been effected. In general, the
agricultural art falls far below the condition
ot productiveness and improvement
which it might obviously attain ; and the
aversion among farmers to change their
established h ibits, and the slowness with
which agricultural improvements of great
and decided advantage extend themselves,
even into neighbouring districts,
are well known and sufficiently remarkable.
Something of this has been owing
to the stationary habits of farmers, to a
want of education, and neglect of read
ing and inquiry ; and much to prejudice
the natural child of ignorance, again*
scientific suggestions and the applicatioi
of science to art, which, so far as the]
are concerned, is wholly of a piractica
character. This prejudice against th<
applications of science to agriculture, 01
to what in vulgar parlance is called book
farming, has we confess, found some na
tural encouragement in the fact, that ma
ny persons wholly destitute of practica
knowledge and skill, have undertaken t(
apply purely theoretical rules, withoui
i . a m i* % a A
regard 10 (liiterences or sou, climate, na
tureofcrop, and nameless circumstance!
by which the application of these rulei
should be varied, or might be renderec
unseasonable or futile ; and that, in trutl
many persons hare undertaken to make
hooks, and to give directions in husbandry
who were grossly ignorant of its greal
principles, and possessed little kaow ledge
of its vanons practical details and rules,
It must, ut the same time, be admitted
that science has as yet accomplished bu
little ; and that, beyond that knowledge
which any intelligent, practieal and expe<
rienced man easily and almost necessari.
ly acquires of soils, manures, vegetation,
and crops, little has been ascertained ol
a practical value ; and the profound se.
cretsof vegetable life,or what is properlj
termed vital action in vegetable organisnr
and growth, remain in all their origina
nbtruseuess and mystery. The little sue
cess, therefore, which seientific men have
had in their attempts to resolve and ex
plain them, and especially the little prac.
tical utility which has come from theii
rhetorical explanations, have created
with the purely practical, a prejudice
against such inquiries, as invincible &<
it is unworthy of sensible men.
Yet it will not be denied, in this case
that we know as much of vegetable as w<
know of animal life. Anatomy may be
termed an exact science; it is to a greai
extent matter of sensible observation anc
measurement; but the operations in the
human organism, which are strictly vital,
are altogether undisclosed. We know
. in truth as much how the stems an<i

leaves ana iruu are iormea ana periecieu
?8 we know how the food, which we receive,
is converted into blood, and serum,
and bile, and muscle, and fibre, and tendon,
and bone; and we know no more,
Shall we despair of going further ? By
no means. There seems, indeed, in this
case, to be a limit of enquiry; an impan.
sable barrier, where human sagacity and
inquisitiveness are at once repelled ; th*3
darkness is intense before, above, and
around U9, and the mere rush-light, which
we hold out to guide us, serves no purpose
but to render this darkness visible. Shall
we then be discouraged in all attempts at
further advancement ? Not at all. I t
may be indeed that we reached the end
of our line ; and that, until new endow,
mentsare bestowed, the mind can soar nc
h igher in its flight. But with equal, nay,
with much more reason may we suppose,
that the cause of failure is not so much
attributable to the limitation or impo/?
? A ft ll ..
tence ot our faculties to proceed turtner,
as to the imperfection or error of our
modes of approach and inquiry. The
philosophical mind, valuing truth and
knowledge as the highest of all attain,
ments, will never rest satisfied with pres
ent acquisitions; will regard that which
is conceivable as knowab/e ; like a vigi.
lant and skilful officer before a beseiged
fortress, whose direct approach is precluded,
will be continually seeking some
private or concealed mode of access; or,
like tne man in the Scriptures knocking

The immense imporrance and value ol
knowledge in this case no sensible man
can doubt. If knowledge and science
are useful in any art or science are useful
in art or department of business, why
should they not be in agriculture, an arl
which involves many others, and which
in its success combines the influence and
operation of more elements than any
other? It is well ascertained that certain
plants will grow only in certain situation.1and
under certain circumstances; thai
different soils have different properties
prejudicial to the growth of some plants
favorable to the perfection of others ; ii
some cases distinguished by an cxhuber
ont fertility, in others by an almost incurable
barreness, but yet in most cases capable
of modification, remedy or im

by some modes of cultivation, double the

It is ascertained that by the applicatior
of gypsum, or soda or ualt, or various ani

, ample room tor the application of science

? Separate however, from the obvious utilr
ity of such inquiries, it is difficult to con. i

i There are besides grounds of encour. 1

The medicinal qualities of tomatoes ,

near Fackenham, Norfolk county, which
weighs eightv.four pounds, and girths

PRESERVING EGGS.
A Mr. Jayne, of Yorkshire, England,
obtained a patent for the following receipt,
for preserving eggs, which we think wor.
thy of trial:
One bushel of quick lime, 82 ounces of
salt, 8 ounces of cream of tartar.
Mix the same tpgether with as much
water as will reduce the comDosition to
zonsistency that an egg when put into it,
will swim. It is said eggs have been kept
in this way, sound for two years.
SPECIMEN OF FEMALE INDUSTRY.
We were shown yesterday, five beautiful
silk shawls, made of double and twisted
sewing silk, which in texture, weight an**
:olor, will compare with any India Shawls
af the same material. Four of them
were a yard square, and the other, black,
about a yard and a half square. The
twist wa9 even and free from all knots,
ind the whole skillfully and beautifully
put together. We take pride in the fact
that they were made by a iady, and a native
of Georgia. They are the hand
work of Mrs. Oliver W. Cox, of Henry
County, Georgia, who raised the worths,
reeled and twisted the silk, and knotted
the shawls. She is a pattern of female
3kill and industry to her sex, which if
generally imitated, will be the means of
makibg the fair of Georgia as useful as
they are attractive, and help-racets in
very deed to their husbands.
While speaking of domestic industry,
we saw yesterday our friend Burton of
the Hazard District, in this county, dressed
in a full suit of domestic Nankin,
scarcely distinguishable from the article
of Pekin. He raised the cotton, his wife
and daughters carded and spun it, his
wife wove the cloth, and cut-out and
made the coat, pantaloons and vest. Here
is an example of good housewifery deserv.

THE WOBUBNfl. , 4
A correspondent of the New York
Spirit of the Times, accompanies a cut
of a Woburn boar with the following remarks:
This animal was imported, from Wo.
born, in England, and is considered by
many judges of stock, to be the finest specimen
of swine in the United States.
Two members of the Committee, to
award prizes on stock at the last Fair of
the American Institute, informed me since
that they considered him a perfect animal,
and could not point out a fault.
By the way, these two gentlemen, are
not interested in any particular breed of
swine.
His measurement at 22 months old,
was 7 feet 8 inches long, 6 feet 2 inches
in girth, and 2 feet 81-2 inches high; and
he was supposed to weigh nearly seven
hundred pounds.
From the great difficulty of obtaining
, swine of this breed in England, few have
been imported, and they are not extensively
known in this country.
The Complete Grazier, <(a work on live
' stock, published in London) says of the
Wobprn breed, "This is a new variety, introduced
by the late Duke of Bedford;
i its size is large, and color various. These
i swine are well formed, hardy, kindly disr
posed1 to tatten, attaining nearly twice the
! size and weight of other hogs, in a given
i period of time."
Ree's Cyclopaedia describes them as "a
1 harHir urall frtrmAst nrnlifin oArt riainff
? Muau^y ? ?w? iMWf j/?wi???v vvi*|
quickly to a large weight."
An importation of Woburn swine wasihade
several years since to Long Island,
> and they were nearly all destroyed by the:
, burning of the barn in which they were
kept.
A gentleman in Connecticut had obtained
some of that stock, and not know,
ing the name of the breed, called, them
> Norfolk thin rind; they have been crossed
with native stock, and are very celebrated
in that section of the country.
One was slaughtered last fall, fourteen
months old, which weighed, when dressed,
480 pounds.
The steward of the Duke of Bedford,
last spring informad Captain Morgan, of
the London line of Packets, that the Woburn
hogs became so fat as to be objectionable
on that account.. .
In this country, where Indian corn is
