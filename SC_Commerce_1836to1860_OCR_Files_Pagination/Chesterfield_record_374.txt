On SaturJay las', about noon, the most
frightful storm visited tills pf.ee and the
surrounding country, that we have ever wit.
nessed. We have heard of such things, hut
we have met with no one#who ever saw
them before. A bl ?ck cloud which came
^ up from the West suddenly discharged its
contents of wind, rain and hail, in n perfect
deluge. The hail came down at first in
small bodies, and rapidly increased in size,
until it fell in masses almost as large as n
man's fist. The largest one wo saw measured
wns 9J inches in circumference, but
we heard ofone which was pic ked up nearly
twice as large. It continued for about 10
minutes, in which lime it destroyed the greater
part of [the growing crops nnd gardens
within its range, pelted down nearly all the
frui*? and broke perhaps from 20,000 to 60,.
000 panes of glass in this town alonp. Pigeons
Hying in the air were knocked down
dead, poultry \?ere killed, horses standing
i
in the streets were frightened, ~nd galiope
otTin ail directions, and indeed such a seen
of alarm we have never witnessed.
It extended over a space abou 4 mil<
wide by pcrh ?ps SO in lengthy in all oi'whic

NEW INVENTIONS.

two new inventions?one American, the o il
rr, we b?d.eve, French?which seem !;k?-i
to I'fF-r.t revolution? of parent though uth'qui
n - v
importance in the world of manufacture.
The American nove'ty is a machine l>
which woolen cloth of every sort is produ
eed at 1' ss than a fourth part of the co<
hitherto usual. The material is not wovcr
but compressed. Two urehms, with th
machine, can turn ou: one hundred yard
of tho broadcloth in twelve hours; on<
wliere 245. wore demanded 'per yard, 6s
afford the new manufacturers abundan
remuneration. We ha\e inspected tin1
handled (as roughly as we lik"d) spe"ini'*n
of every vanity. from the finest s^arle
cloth for officers* uniforms down to blank
ef's and carpets and we certainly could not
either bv sight or toueb, distinguish then
from correspond ng piec s in the old fash
ton.
The French device is of a very difP-ren
sort, hut must also have very fmarkubli
results. To specimens of this new tnnnn
fictttre were exhibi ed nt the Marquis o
NorthamptonV last soiree, as President o
the Royal So-'e'ty,- and they rhen exciter
the curiosifv and astonishments of the ;is
