LARGE CONFERENCES-CONFERENCE
lines. . :.-V •’
■ £' Brptker Elliott,—I would not knowingly inter,
fere with what doeB not belong to me; but it may
be deemed appropriate and proper for those who
ate required to superintend the whole work to make
' ■ suggestions as to the manner of laying it off. In
passing through the entire connection, as I have
..; done Within seven or eight, years past, my own ob
nervations have led me to entertain certain views
as to thesize and boundaries of our annual confer.
•V- ences, which several brethren have requested that
I would express publicly. Ido it with deference
to all concerned, and entirely on my own responsi.
bility. If others differ with me in opinion, as they
; ' probably will, and certainly have a right to do,. I
• shall not dispute with them about the matter,
.V though if misunderstood or misrepresented, I may
think proper to explain. , ,. . . .
As to the size of conferences, I think very large'
A ones are objectionable on several accounts; such
as the needless waste of time and money in attend
ing them. Many of our brethren have to travel
' from one to two hundred miles to attend confer
ence, and as much to return to their Work. Some
; of the large conferences require two weeks or
more to transact their business, which is a needless
loss of time. Suppose a conference which re
quires two weeks to hold its session, and two more
to going and returning, were divided, then the
members of each could accomplish the object in
half thd time ; that is one week for conference
.-.i and one for going and returning. Now, allowing
- a. Conference to contain two hundred preachers, and
• each to save two weeks by the division, there would
be a nett saving of four hundred weeks of minis
. V terial labor, or equal to the labor of one efficient
'if preacher for about eight years.
Again: conferences, like the members compos,
ing them, should be itinerant. Nothing is so well
calculated to fix a strong impression in favor of
Methodism on the population of a village and the
'• - surrounding country, as a conference of travelling
preachers with hearts warm from scenes of revi
vals in their respective churches. Those confer
ences which are small enough to itinerate among
' the villages within their bounds are usually attend
’•ed with revivals of religion, while very large ones
can be held only in a few large places, where they
become so common, not to say burdensome,.that
j. they cease to be regarded with much interest.
One hundred men are as many as can conveniently
do business together. One hundred preachers,
and those who have business with them at confer
ence, are as many as can comfortably be provided
for, except at a few large places, without oppress
ing the people. When the number increases to
one hundred and fifty, the conference should be
1 divided into two: seventy-five preachers make a
respectable conference, and with ordinary prosperi
ty will, in eight or twelve years, become so large
• as to require a re-division. We know that friends
dislike to separate; and, consequently, large con
ferences, like large classes, are often opposed to
being divided. But does not the interest of the
work require it 1 That is the question.
Secondly. There is, perhaps, nothing in the tem
poral economy of the Methodist Episcopal Church
susceptible of greater improvement than the pre
sent system of prescribing her conference lines.
Communities perfectly similar in regard to the
general usages of society are severed, while those
quite dissimilar are, for conference purposes, thrown
together, greatly to the embarrasment and injury
of the work. I may be allowed, with perfect re.
ft spect and good feeling to all concerned, to give a
‘ few examples. The Holston conference is com
posed of fragments of the states of Tennessee,
Georgia, South-Carolina, North-Carolina and Vir
ginina. The Baltimore conference includes parts
of the states of Maryland, Virginia and Pennsyl
vania. The Philadelphia conference lies in the
stateB of Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maiyland and
Virginia. The Pittsburg conference lies in the
states of Pennsylvania, Ohio and Virginia. Other
examples might be given. The manner of dis
tributing into conferences is singular enough. For
example : the state of North-Carolina is distribut
ed into Holston, South-Carolina and Virginia con
ferences, while the North-Carolina conference it
self is partly in the state of Virginia. The
state of Virginia is distributed into the Baltimore,
Philadelphia, Pittsburg, Ohio, Holston and North
Carolina conferences, while Virginia conference
proper is partly in the state of North-Carolina.
The state of Pennsylvania is distributed into the
Baltimore, Pittsburg, Erie, Genesee, and perhaps
Oneida conferences, while the Philadelphia con
ference lies partly in Maryland, Delaware and Vir
ginia. Now, no individual acquainted with state
peculiarities need be told the inconveniences of
such arrangements, arising from want of informa
tion as to state laws and the general usages of
society. Other denominations can report their
numerical strength in a given state, while we, in
many cases, can only report our numbers in a
given conference made up of fragments of several
states.
As a substitute for the present system of con
ference boundaries, I would respectfully suggest
the following, not pretending to be exactly right in
all its details, but to furnish the outlines of a bet
ter plan than the old one. Conference lines
should never cross state lines, except to include
mere isolated points inaccessible by preachers of
the states in whose limits they are situated ; and
when it becomes necessary to divide a state into
two or more conferences, the boundaries should be
.. designated by counties, except where there are
natural lines clearly laid down, such as large rivers,
lakes, or high mountains. Keeping these prin
ciples in view, my plan would be in substance, as
follows: The state of New York, five confer,
ences ; the state of Connecticut and Rhode Island,
, one conference; the state of Massachusetts, one
conference; state of Maine, two conferences;
state of New Hampshire, one conference; state
of Vermont, one conference ; state of Michigan,
one conference; state of Ohio, four conferences ;
state of Indiana, two conferences ; state of Illinois,
two conferences; state of Kentucky, one confer
ence for the present; state of Tennessee, two
conferences ; Wisconsin and Iowa territories, one
conference for the present; state of Missouri, one
conference ; state of Arkansas, one conference ;
Republic of Texas, one conference; states ol
Mississippi and Louisiana, one conference for the
present; state of Alabama, one conference ; state
of Georgia, and Florida Territory, two conferences
for the present; state of South Carolina, one con.
ference; state of North Carolina, one conference
state of Virginia, three conferences ; state of Mary,
land and Delaware and the Ditrict of Columbia
one conference; state of Pennsylvania, two con.
ferences ; and the state of New Jersey, one con.
ference.
The foregoing plan would arrange the whole
work into forty conferences, about the number we
■hall probably have under the old plan after next
General Conference.1 I have not the vanity to be
lieve' that my plan will soon be adopted entirely,
because of local interests and attachments; but
that some such plan would be a vast improvement
in our system of operations, if adopted, I do believe
most honestly. Thos. A. Morris.

Dont, I entreat you, all who are concerned. I
mean the money which you promised to aid in pro
curing a District Parsonage for the Wilmington
District Some, I know, have paid to the preach
ers, as P requested ; but some : may not have seen
that request, or may have forgotten it. Will any
such one please hand his amount to the preacher
forthwith, that he may bring it to. the Conference

Eight Days later from Europe.—We are in
debted, says the New York Journal of Commerce,
January 10, to Captain Edwards, of the ship Sea,
which arrived last night from Liverpool, for En
glish papers to Monday December 18th, inclusive.
The packet ship Roscius, from N. Y. arrived at
Liverpool on the 12th, bringing five days later in
telligence. The steamer Caledonia arrived on
the 13th.
Of the £100,000 which it was proposed to raise
for the furtherance of Free Trade principles, hav
ing reference more especially to free trade in
grain, £25,000 had already been subscribed.—
There was no doubt but the whole amount would
be raised.
Sir Ilenry Pottinger has requsted to be recalled
from China, and the British government has acced
ed to his request.
Incendiary fires had become frequent and alarm
ing in England. By one of those fires near Cam
bridge, property to the value of £500 was de
stroyed.
The British Parliament is to meet for the dis
patch of business on the 1st of February.
A British surveying party at Cloudy Bay, New
Zealand, which was accompanied by a military de
tachment, was attacked by the natives, in June
last, and about twenty persons were killed, includ
ing two Captains.
There had been little or no change in cotton';
bread-stuffs declining.
An order in council had fixed the duty on for
eign meat of all kinds, salted or dried, imported into
the Cape of Good Hope, at 3s. per cwt. British, £1
3s. Foreign train and'4rfubbcr oil £3 per ton;
sperm £7 10s.
The opinions of three eminent counsel, who
have been consulted upon the legality of the de
grees conferred upon Mr. Everett, the American
Minister, by the University of Oxford, having been
submitted to the Vice Chancellor, they have all
concurred in pronouncing the whole proceeding
null and void.
The Iron Trade.—The trade is still retrograd
ing, and bars are sold at £4 2s 6d net at Newport
and Cardiff, with a dull sale even at that.
The Chinese Government has severely punished
the authorities at Formosa, under whom certain
proceedings took place respecting the destruction
of two British ships. The documents are long, and
we shall take an early opportunity of giving their
substance.
The Great Western and Great Britain
Steam Ship Company.—At a special general meet
ting of the shareholders, held in Bristol, it was an
nounced that the Great Britqjn would be ready for
an experimental trip in February next; upon which
a resolution was unanimously passed, thatameeting
of the proprietors be summoned on the 2d of January,
to decide upon her following the Groat Western on
the New York line early in May, which the direc
tors stated, after mature consideration, was their
intention, provided it met with the sanction of the
shareholders. The directors were subsequently
empowered to borrow £10,000 to complete the ship
for sea. The Great Western’s net profits for the
past season were stated to amount to £5,600, out of
which it is proposed to give the shareholders a divi
dend of 50s per share.
A great Free Trade demonstration was mode a
Liverpool on the 8th. Mr. Cobden, Mr. Bright
and other celebrated Free Traders were present
and made speeches.
An ingenious and very useful invention has just
been exhibited, and its powers tried on the Brigh
ton and Croydon Railway ; it is called a pedomo

six persons, two of whom propel it by means of
treadies applied on a new and advantageous prin
ciple.
It is stated by Mr. Murray, me icciureron cnem
istry, that the incrustatiou of steam boilers may
certainly be prevented, either by acidulating the
water with sulphuric acid, or putting in sawdust of
any kind ot wood.
A Scotch paper states that Mr. Hill, of Eden
hall, has refused 600/. for his celebrated short
horned bull Eden.
Free Trade Triumph in Liverpool.—By the
time our paper will have reached the majority ol
our readers to-day, the Liverpool contribution to the
funds to the Anti-Corn Law League, will, we doubt
not, have reached five thousand pounds,—very lit
tle being wanted to complete that magnificent sum
at the present moment. It would be a piece of
impertinence on our part to attempt to offer any
remarks beyond what this most startling but most
gratifying announcement must give rise to in
the mind of every man capable of drawing
an obvious inference from self-evident and
undeniable premises; nor shall we venture to
encumber, with our ieeble and superfluous praise,
the indefatigable Anti-Monopoly Association of this
town, to whom so large a portion of the credit ol
this glorious and ennobling result is attributable,—
seeing that Mr. Cobden has already borne the tri
bute of his panegyric to exertions that carry with
them their own best eulogiura.—Liverpool Journal,
Dec. 9.
Liverpool, Dec. 18.—Cotton.—Cotton is in
good demand, but freely offered, and the market

Manchester, Dec. 15.—Cotton.—We have
had a pretty fair business in Cloth this week, and
at pripes without change, though many anticipate
that by the return of the turn outs to their labor
again, that goods would have exceeded in value.
On the contrary, prices must be regarded as quite
firm, end even buoyant since.Tuesday. In Twist
there is nnquotable difference since this day week
—a good demand exist both from India and China.
France.—The King accompanied by the Prince
de Joinville, left St. Cloud Dec. 13th, for Fontain

On Sunday, the inhabitants of the first and se
cond districts of Paris, assembled in their respect
ive municipalities to elect candidates for the posts
of mayor and adjoints, signed a petition to the Cham
bers, demanding the demolition of the detached
forts erected round the caDital.
The French government affects (for it cannot be
serious) apprehensions of a movement in La Ven
dee. The National Btates, that a notification has
been made to the Spanish refugees domiciled in
Lower Brittany, that they must choose a residence

The Paris papers contain appalling lists of mur
ders and suicides, and of attempts to commit those
crimes. The most recent murder announced in
Paris is that of the widow of the AmbigU Comique,
who was strangled in her residence in the Rue du
Temple, the most populous part of Paris, on Thurs
day last, in open day. Five days previously, at St.
Denis, near Paris, a monster of herculean strength,
siezed upon an unoffending young man, and throw
ing him down on the road, held him firmly until
the wheels of an approaching wagon had passed
over his head!
Paris papers of Tuesday contain no important
news. The Deputies were arriving daily in Paris
for the opening of the Chambers, and already the
Opposition papers remark, that the complaisances
of the Conrt were extended to the class preparato
ry to the introduction of certain projects,—one a
donation for the Duke de Nemours. Little doubt
was entertained that severe measures would be ta
ken in respect of the Peers and Deputies of France
who had repaired to England to do homage to the
Duke de Bordeaux.
The Journal des Chemins de Fer announces the
formation of a new Anglo-French company, which
is about to apply for the privilege of cctnstructing a
rail-road between Paris and Lyons, branching from
the Corbell road. M. Charles Lafitte, of Paris,
and Mr. J. II. Attwood, of London, appear at the
head of this new undertaking.
Ihe Texan Prisoners.—Relative to the condi
tion of these unfortunate men in their captivity, we
have received from a gentleman at Vera Cruz, a

A Situation to be had.—We commend the
following from a fair correspondent of the Colum

of our own “ spruce young men
“Notice.—Wanted, at Columbia, a few spruce
younw men, to stand at the church doors, at the as
sembling of the congregation, for the devout pur
pose of staring the ladies out of countenance. No
other qualification than a good share of impudence
is requisite for this employment. If, however,
should be added to this, a complete destitution of a
sense of propriety, or a talent for making polite re
marks upon each lady as she passes, or even a ca
pability of exciting a laugh among his comrades at
her expense, the applicant will be considered as
mere eminently qualified for his Btation.
N. B. Persons desirous of engaging in this busi
ness will please take their stand, at the ringing of
the bells next Sabbath, for the express purpose of
giving a specimen of their powers. Virgo.
We hope, says the Editor of the “Advocate,”
our fair correspondent, and the public generally,
will attend at the church, on Sabbath morning
next, precisely at ten minutes past ten o’clock, to
witness the exhibition, and decide upon the merits
of the performers. We know several young gen
tlemen who have recently supplied themselves
with new coats, red vests, green scarfs checked
tights, yellow kids, and gold-headed canes, who
would like to put in their claims, if the day tic not
too damp for the delicate “ crechaws” to go out,
without danger of taking cold or spoiling their
new clothes. We hope that the ladies will ap
point a committee to decide on the claims of the
applicants, and to inform the lucky individuals of
their appointment.—Charleston Mercury.
1 ROTKC'TION OK V Ul.ITIVE MURDERERS.—NAS
SAU, N. P., Jan. 3d, 1844.—The Revenue Cutter
“ Nautilus” Capt. Walden, arrived here on the 24th
ult. from Key West, having on board the U. S.
Marshal for the Southern District of Florida, who
came as the authorized agent of his Government,
for the purpose of making a demand upon the au
thorities here for the seven negroes who recently ran I
away from St. Augustine, and who were demanded
as fugitives from justice; having, as was alleged,
committed robbery and murder previous to making
their escape. The Marshal and gentlemen accom
panying him were courteously received by the Go
vernor, who immediately upon receiving the proper
requisition, issued his warrant to the magistrates,
and gave notice to the Marshal that lie could ap
pear before them with his depositions and testimo
ny in the case, for a hearing. It appeared before
the judges that all the testimony relied upon was a
Bill of Indictment, charging the negroes with robbe
ry and murder, and parties present to identify them
as the same persons named in the Bill. The judges
deemed this sort of evidence altogether unsatis
factory, and not such as was required by the Act of
Parliament, and very speedily and decidedly refused
to grant a warrant for the apprhension of the men.
Had, however, the testimony been such as to have
induced the Judges to grant a warrant, it would
have been with much difficulty, and a long time
probably would have elapsed before the negroes
could have been found, for the news of the Cutter’s
coming, and the object of her visit had preceded
her some time before by the arrival of a small ves
sel of Harbor Island from Key West; besides
which notice, certain paragraphs had been copied
into the press here taken from some of your news
papers, Btating that these runaway slaves had com
mitted murder, and that a demand would proba
bly be made for them by the II.States Government.
Publicity having been thus imprudently given to
the matter, the men had ample time to make their es
cape, and doubtless found friends enough not only to
warn them of their danger, but to aid them in get
ting to the out Islands and small cays, where had a
warrant been issued against them, and good faith
observed in endeavoring to apprehend them, they
would have been able for 4 long time to have secre
ted themselves. Thus far has the first demand
upon the British authorities for fugitives from jus.
tice under the new treaty failed, as is alleged, for
want of proper testimony to warrant a compliance
with the requisition.
The business for which the cutter was sent
having been thus speedily disposed of she sailed for
Key West yesterday, with the Marshal and other
passengers on board.—Correspondence of the N.
Y. Journal of Commerce.
Melancholy Death by Fibe.—On Wednesday
last, as a young lady of this city was standing bv
the fire-place in the parlour, her dress took fire, and,
losing her presence of mind, she was unable to give
the alarm, no one being present but two little chil
dren, who were unable to render her any assistance;
and the family were only apprized of the fact by
some of the neighbors, who saw her, enveloped in
flames, while making her way into the yard. They
immediately hastened to her assistance, and soon
extinguished the fire; but, alas ! too late to render
her any material relief; she was so much burnt
that she died from the effects on Friday evening.
We notice the occurrence more particularly as a
caution to all, and particularly to heads of families,
whose children are frequently left alone in roomB
where there is fira.—Charleston Courier.
Captain Thomas, of the schooner Star, from
New-Orleans, arrived at this port yesterday, res
cued from a watery grave, Daniel Webber, one
of the crew of the schooner Alexander Watson,
wrecked on Tuesday last on the South breaker.—
He was discovered on the 20th, thirty miles East
of the bar, clinging to a small portion of the quar
ter deck, and when taken off was almost exhaust
ed, having had nothing to eat or drink during the
time.
Mr. W. is of opinion that the captain and one of
the crew perished shortly after leaving the wreck.
The mate and himself drifted to sea on a part of
the wreck, and were together until Thursday night,
when the mate was drowned.—Charleston Mercury.
The Mormons.—The Mormons have recently
held a meeting at Nauvoo, at which they resolved
that “ Joe Smith is not guilty of any charge made
against him by the State of Missouri.” The city
authorities have passed an ordinance, directing the
imprisonmont for life of any person who shall come
within the corporate limits of Nauvoo, with p legal
process for the arrest of Joe Smith, for any offence
committed by him in Missouri during the Mormon
difficulties.
The Prophet Joe has also declared that he con
siders it his duty, as Lieutenant General of the Nau
voo Legion and militia of Illinois, to enforce said
ordinance.

COKESBURY CONFERENCE SCHOOL.
Our patrons and friends arc reminded that the exerci
ses of this school will recommence on the first day of
February next. We renew the request heretofore re
peatedly made, that all applicants for admission should, if
practicable, be punctually present at the opening of the
term. This request is suggested by regard for the in
terests of the student, as well as for the conveniences of
classification.
The attention of our patrons is particularly called to
that regulation of the school which prohibits any stu
dent from purchasing goods on a credit, without the
permission of the Rector in writing. To enable the
Rector to give such permission, the consent and authority
of the parent or guardian are first necessary. Our friends,
the friends of youth generally, must perceive and readily
grant the propriety and expediency of such a regulation.
The co-operation of the parent is necessary, to carry it
out and make it effectual. No account made in the face
of this rule, and contrary to its provisions ought to be
paid. Every one has witnessed the tendencies to injudi
cious expenditure, and extravagance in collections of
youth partially released from parental control. Every
parent is immediately interested in checking this spirit.

THE INTERPRETER.
A Semi-monthly Journal, devoted to the
English, French, Spanish, Italian & Gennai
LANGUAGES.
Under the above title, we propose to issue, or
the 20th of the present month, the first number ol
a semi-monthly periodical; and as the public have
a right, whenever a new work is attempted to be
brought to their notice, to demand that the neces
sity or utility of such a work be fully shown,
we would state that,
The necessity for such a work arises out of the
fact that there are hundreds of thousands in our
country who profess to be pursuing the studies of
which we propose to treat, each one of whom needs
advice, direction and assistance in the pursuit of
them. Does he wish to know the difference be
tween the construction of his own language and
that of either of those above-named, he can, it is
true, find many valuable works in the libraries and
at the book-stores, that will aid him in acquiring
this information. He may also send for the native
teacher, in some instances, and receive instruction
from his lips,—but such assistance is not always
within reach, and in many cases it is entirely inac
cessible. Here then is a necessity,—a pressing
necessity for such a work,—a necessity created by
a large and daily increasing class of persons, and
for which no adequate supply,—no supply whatever
of the kind that we propose,—has yet been pro
vided. Nearly two years have elapsed since we
conceived the plan, which we now purpose attempt
ing to execute; and though our Journal may be a
modification of the plan then conceived, yet, sub
stantially, it was partially executed, and announced
in the Southern Quarterly Review for June, 1842.
Circumstances over which we had no control pre
vented its consummation at that period. Whatever
impressions we may then have had of the necessity
for such a work, have been strengthened by the
lapse of time, and we now hope to carry its main
features into execution.
/ he utility of such a work is as evident as its
necessity. Are there hundreds of thousands in
need of an Interpreter giving them the precise
meaning of every foreign word which it uses 1 Just
such an interpreter this proposes to be. And in
addition to giving the bad English of good French,
German, &c., it will also give a good English trans
lation of all its examples. This Interpreter the
student can always have in his pocket, for a very
trifling outlay,—furnishing him with useful mat
ter where the living teacher is accessible, and
of inestimable value to him when he cannot obtain
such aid,—affording that constant supply demanded
by every ardent student.
Our plan for conducting the work. The Inter
preter will be printed on a large octavo page, using
the best materials, and executed in good style; each
number to contain 16 pages, in a neat cover, which
may be bound at the end of the year, forming a
large volume of 416 pages. The original, whether
French, Spanish, German or Italian, will always
be translated literally into its corresponding part
of speech in English,—thus clearly exhibiting the
construction of each language. Exercises will
often be given, which can be translated into the
foreign language by all desirous of acquiring the
talent of writing a foreign language ; which exer
cises will always be translated into that language,
thus enabling the student to verify his translation
by the printed one. If there be any truth in the
assertion of the immortal Milton, that we do amiss
to spend seven or eight years merely in scraping
together as much miserable Greek and Latin as
might, with the requisite helps, be learned easily
and delightfully in one year, how much more are
we to be blamed for spending seven or eight years
in attempting to learn a single modern language,
when three or four may be acquired in half that
time. To furnish the helps requisite for this at
tainment, is, then our object; and, in attempting to
carry it out, we shall avoid grammatical niceties
for some time, being fully persuaded that it is far
more beneficial to give a largo amount of reading
before troubling the student with grammatical ana
lysis. Still, we feel assured that our system wil!
give ample scope to the talents of those who are
grammatically acquainted with their native tongue,
as it will enable such students to parse a for
eign language from the very outset. And though
it is with us a principle to combine with the
maximum of practice the minimum of theory
in the commencement of linguistic studies ; yet
when the proper time shall have arrived no
thing shall be omitted, which we can be furnishec
with by the respective national and other grammat
ical authorities. We are satisfied, that, by pursu
ing this system, the subscriber to the Interpreter,
if he follow its directions, will be able, in the space
of a few months, to write a large amount of all five
languages; and, in a year or two, to translate any
work in either language, not above his capacity,
into English : speaking them will follow very soon,
if the student be brought into contact with those
who speak them. lie may rest assured he is fully
nine-tenths of the way to this desirable object
when he can translate his mother tongue into the
foreign language.

HEARS’ NEW AND COMPLETE HlSTORt
OF THE BIBLE.
In referring to this work it is not necessary that w
enter into long details; let it suffice that we affirm tha
the most learned and enlightened of our countrymei
agree in pronouncing it well worthy of the patronage c
every Christian, together with all who refer to the Bibl
as a Text Book. It is written in a plain and open style
which can be as easily understood by the ignorant as b;
the educated. It has been remarked by many that th’
Bible is written in so obscure a style that few can com
prehend it. Here then we have it expounded and com
mented upon at length, with notes, both critical and ex
planatory, by men who have made it the study of years
forming of itself a History of near four thousand years
Two volumes in one*containing near seven hundred largi
