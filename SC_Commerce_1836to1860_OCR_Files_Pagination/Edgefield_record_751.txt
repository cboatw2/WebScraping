"There is some coneversation here in rela

tot-day, without signature, entaitled ".An
appesi to ah'e Demoeu'asi party on the
priniciples of a National'oenvention for alth
nomination of President itktt Vice Preesi

thme wrifer- is to ibipreus on the party a con
vitcto of the injustice and ineequality of
Ithe mnode hitherto adopted cr expressing
ehe w ishees of the party through a conven
tion. Te sygtem suppresses the will
of laerge mwit2Oitren each Sato. and ena
bles the larger States to throw the undivi

ses that the conevention be composed not of
State delegations representing the number
of electoral'votes to which the State may
own or district. representing the ndajority
af the party in that district. He ItIcuWs
iat no Convenion, fraied on any other

Ilints to F-urmer.-A V armter should
ever undertake tocultivano more land than
b can do'thoroughily; half titled land is
growing poor;weli tilled laud is constant
ly improving.
A farmier should never keep more cattle
hrss, sheep or bogs, than he can keep in:
god order; ant animal in high order the
first of Docember, is~alrr ady half wintered.
A farper should never depend on hi:
neighbor for w bat he can, by care and good
mnaRgmentl, produco on his own farm; he
shottid never beg fruit while he can plani1
trees, or horrow tools when he can muake
or buoy lham--a high authority has said
the horrower is servant to the lender.
A fa'rmer shotbhd neverbe so immierscd it
poitienl matters as forget to sow hisw lheat,
dig his potatoes' anid bank them up in'bid
cellar, nor should lie be so inattentive ti
them as 1o he ignorant of those greit quecs
tion ofntional and state policy which wil
always agitate, rffore or less, a free people
No farmer should allow the reproach o
neglected education to lie against himasel
or ihmily; if "knowledlge is ower," the
conmfecemenlt should be ea yS~ and deepi:
lid in the minds of bis children.
A faremer an,,ld rccver osn inrnxiemim;
liquors as a drink; if, while undergoin; se
vere fatigue and the hard labor of the sum
m fer.ie would enjoy robust heatb, let hiu
be temperalo in all things.
A farmer should never refuse a fair price
for anything he wants to sell: we have
kiown a aman who had several hundred
bushels of %% heat to diipose of. refuse eibt
shillings and six pincce. and after keeping
his wheat six months was glad to get six
shilliugs for it.-Farmner's Cabinet.
