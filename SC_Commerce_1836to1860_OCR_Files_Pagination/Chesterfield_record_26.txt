Judge Buel?I take the liberty of enclosing
to you a copy of a letter just received
from Mr. Whitaker, tiie ceiebratod oreeuer j
of Durham Cattle in England.
It is in reply to an order I sent him for
the lest one vcar old Durham short horned ;
hull he could procure. The breeders of j
this country- will be-gratified to learn the es-1
timation and increased value of the best
Durham cattle tu England, where purity of.
blood and excellency of pedigree are so
highly appreciated.
It will.be perceived with regret, tfiat Geo. j
Coates, Esq., for many years a distinguish, j
ed breeder of Short Horns, and the keeper
of the Herd Book, died Oct. 20th. He had
nearly arranged the pedigrees for the so- i
cond supplement to the Herd Book, and his ;
son has now undertaken to carry it through
the press.
iwint'omPii in rmintrv who are

subscribers, will probably receive their copies
early in the spring, and it will give additional
value to their herds, if their pedigrees
have been forwarded, in time for pub-!
f cation. Very respectfully vours,

"My dear Sir?I beg to acknowledge the 1
receipt ofyour letter of the 27th lilt. I have |
little doubt of meeting with a superior year-,
ling bull before next May. 1 have none of j
a proper age at present, of my own, but 1;
have two well.bred crows to calve, to a bull!
for which I offered 200 guineas; one, ofj
high pedigree, (and the only one of iny old j
family,) to calve about the end of this month:
the other is also of good blood and long pe-,
iligree, to calve in January. I sent seven
hulls and females to New York for the state
of Ohio, last July, and should 1 get one tor
you, I hope it will not have to compete with
any of those bulls. I offered 200 guineas
for the bull alluded to above, (bred by mc
and sold at my sale in September, 1833, tor
124 guineas,) but could not prevail on the
gentleman to sell* There have been two
gentlemen from Kentucky, offering great j
prices, without buying any thiug. Their
inquiries were confined to a few small breed. |
ere only. I hope to be able to purchase ;
one of the best young bulls for 100 guineas,
and perhaps less, as you allow sufficient j
time to look round. When I made my sale, j
it was with the intention of abandoning i
breeding for the public altogether, but ma- !
mr friends would not allow me to follow my |
owli inclination, but solicited me to make
purchases for them, also urging me to keep
a few good animals myself believing, I suppose,
from my long experience, that mv
judgment was better than their own; and I
have so far complied with their wishes as
to select many good ones for them and myself.
But I shall not be induced again to
let bulls to the public, which is attended with
great expense ana great mortification, the
finest animals in my fold having been let
out and returned mere skeletons. You
can, if you please, give me a draft on some
house in Liverpool. The greatest risk will
be in the transit of the bull from Liverpool
to New York. I sent a man with those
shipped in July, and he delivered them, he
says, in as good order as when they were
put on board. But this would be too ex.
pensive for one animal; I would therefore
suggest the prudence of your speaking to a
captain in whom you cau depend, for care
and proper attention.

promises the second Supplement shall be
out soon after the end of this year, and he is
quite competent to the work.
"As soon as I have the pleasure of hearing
from you again, I will conclude the pur^

AHow roe, if you please, to select one as
much under and above one year old as you
can, because I may find a superior bull, ei.
ther under or above your limits, which I
should hesitate to buy without your permission.
It is usual, I understand, for the shipper
to pay for a stand for the animal, provisions,
<kc., for the passage, and which will
k cost about ?14, and the freight to New
York 25 or 830, and perhaps something
more if a man has to serve him. This you
will of course take into your consideration,
when you hand a credit in Liverpool.

IMPORTANT or good breeds OF CATTLE.
M e wish once more to remind our rear
dcrs upen the importance of keeping a
good breed of caltky even if they keep but a
few of them, rather than a great hewj of | <
poor ones. ? I
The severity of the last winter teaches us j (
a good lesson upon this subject. A few j i
good first rate cattle would not have requir- j
ed so much fodder and have been worth J
much more, of themselves. A large and
handsome cow may perhaps eat something
more than a smaller one, but the labor of ii
i taking care of her is no more?and the x
worth of her in the market is oftentimes d
twice as much as that of the small and d
mean one. This is beginning to be felt and u
practiced upon in the Western country b
where forage is undoubtedly more abun- j is
dant than it is here; and where they are in j ti
the habit of keeping immense herds of cat- j li
tic. They are now turning their attention \ a
cto better breads, thinking no doubt, that it is I p
better to have a smaller number of cattle of j C
great value, than to keep more in number j v
of less individual value. In Ohio during i o
the past year, companies have been form- j A
ed, and Agents sent to England to select j t!
out and purchase the very best that could i p
be found, and import them to this country. t?
Cows and Bulls of the Improved breeds w
sell there fir large prices?while here such s<
is the apathy that a person who ever goes tl
to an extra expense in and of himself to b
procure the best, meets with much ridicule tl
and but little encouragement. We are rt
happy to say that a few spirited individuals o
have obtained the first rate Bulls for the j si
purpose of benefitting those who feci j ^
anxious to improve, and yet the same men I P
will toll you that, setting aside the benefit j
which has been done in their own herds, j rc
they have been poorly requited by any pat- 01
ronage or encouragement from others.? i ^
And what is the reason ? Because most of i
our farmers do not calculate right. They i d<
value caltJe by their numbers rather than j
by their good properties. j
Their minds are cramped down to the j
minimum value of ordinary stock, and it is J
hard to raise it to a higher standard. They
can't for the life of them, s^e why a cow or *f
bull should be worth fifty or an hundred 1
dollars, and that one should ov#r sell for i
three hundred, is the most absurd extrava- j
gance that thoy ever heard of. These :
limited ideas should be enlarged. We do <,
O T a|.
not wish to encourage extravagance. We :111
r.o not wish our farmers to rear Taney stock, j ul
We de not wish that they should go be- !
yond their incomes or means and purchase 11,1
at enormous prices, cattle which have Sl
nothing uncommon or excellent to recom- ' n<
mend them. But we do wish, most earn- jw
estly wish, that they would rouse up a little ' sc
in this respect. Keep not so many, but ! .
those that are better. . Condense the value a.
of your herds into a smaller number of bo- *
dies ; and then the relative profit will be ,
enhanced. It is plain enough to be seen I
that the man who rears a yoke of oxen
which will sell for from $100 to 1">0 at four J ^
|V
or five years old, reaps more than he who |
rears a yoke that he can get but fifty or j j
sixty for, at the same age. If you ure not1 ^
able to improve stock solely yourself, get ^
others to associate with you. Club to-!
gether by neighborhoods and help eacli
other. And if any of your neighbors who j ^
perhaps, cannot well afford, should take a
first rate animal for the season, relying j(
upon your encouragement and support? ! tl
give him your encouragement amtsupporr. j
Don't "as the manner of some is,'* cry him w
down, and "run"* l)im down, and throw
every obstacle in the way. You thereby
do much mischief and no good. Don't j g
practice the play of the dog in the manger, j u]
but put your shoulder to the work, pro- C(
inote everjr laudable undertaking of the j w
kind, cheerfully and promptly. We make ^
these remarks because we know of more | jj
than one instance of the kind; and be- j p
cause also we deem it a fit opportunity to c
call uttention to this subject now, while the j (j
memory of the scarcity of the hay mow is j p
fresh in your minds, Let this precept be i jj
adopted by every farmer?better have fifty n
dollars worth in one cow, than in five, at i s
ten each; and an hundred dollars worth of: >
oxen in one yoke, than in two, at fifty ti
each, and remember that this is just as ti
easily done as it is to follow in tho old 0
system. j ti
, IP
For raising Cabbage.?Take from the a
rahh.iffn. which you generally tl
V,* o _
set out ear!}-, the most prominent after they j fi
have sufficiently expanded themselves; and s
set them out in the same manner you do : n
your plants, and they will immediately take ;']
root and afford you a very early and lu.ru-, b
riant cabbage. Those who have tried this c
method affirm that they are much earlier ! 0
and by far superior to any that can be pro- tl
duced from the plants. They must be bro- i n
ken from the stumps and not cut off, as the 1small
fibres will greatly facilitate their tak- |
ing root. j-f
To kill Cabbage Lice.?As these vermin : ri
infest cabbages, and not unfrequently injure i i,
their growth very much, the following re- rj
ceipt is given in substance as we find it. jj
Make a strong decoction of tobacco, and ;
whefi cool &pply it to the plants by means of a i g
syringe. This syringe should be about two i a
feetlongandanincliindiamcter,havingacap j s
oflead or tin perforated with very small holes ;
to prevent the liquid from falling with too j v
much force upon the plants, (hie applica- s
tion a day for two or throe days will gene- d
rally destroy oil the vermin. n
To remove the taste of Garlic, or wild q
Onions from milk.?When the milk is new 0
t from the cow, pour one quart of boiling wa- ti
I ter into everv paltron of milk; stir it tho-1 a
! roughly, and put the whole into broad shal-1 p
; low dishes so that it will not be above two ,
I inches deep. Let these dishes be placed i't
j an open shelf, that the vapour may pass : c
1 freely and entirely away. When the milk ' r
i has stood in this nianner 12 hours, it may ; $
j be put into a churn, altogether, or only the .
2ream, as may be most agreeable to the t
:aste or practice of the operator. Milk from f
:ows that have pastured on garlic, when c
managed in this way, will be quite sweet. n

Extracts Jram Mr. GarlanSpeech in reply to c
Mr. Bell, Concluded. * d
Mr. Chairman, it was a leading object P
n the formation of our Government to di. a
ride it into three separate and independent a
epartments : legislative, executive, and ju- h
icial?leaving each, as tar as practicable, o
ncontrolled and untrammelled'in its action c
y the interference 6f tiie other. This sir, si
i a constitutional division and a constitu.
onal object; the principle has been sane.
oned by our most distinguished patriots ^
nd statesmen. The executive power is bi
laced in the hands of the President bv the hi
Constitution; and however unwise the in. ai
estment, if it he so, he cannot he divested
f it but by constitutional amendment, fr
miong the most efficient powers vested by ifl
ic Constitution in the President, is the a'
ower of removal from office. The irnpor- tu
tncc attached to this executive power is
'ell illustrated by the fact that, in the first ni
jssion of Congress after the formation of ft
ic Constitution, a provision attached to the P'
ill organizing the State Department, au- 1?
torizing the President to remove the Sec- th
itary from office at pleasure, was stricken It
ut, on the' ground that the power was uncon- pi
titutional, and could not be conferred by w
iw. The proposition to strike out that IV
revision gave rise to a long and able debate, th
i which the question whether the power of
^ i A n
MDovai was nerivea irom mu uoiisiiiuuon ^
r not, was ab!v and elaborately discussed. tli
*
[r. Madison, who participated largely in P<
tat debate, said, while discussing the Prcsi- di
3nt's power of removal : 01
"But there is another part of the Consti- ol
ition which inclines, in my judgment, to le
?rm the construction I put upon it. The
resident is required to take care that the 01
ws be faithfully executed. If the duty to tv
'c the laws faithfully executed be required at. tii
,e Juiuds of the Executive Magistrate, it se
ould seem that it was generally intended he ta

fxcssary to accomplish thai end. Now, if ni
ic officer appointed is not to depend upon w
le President for his official existence, but 01
pon a distinct body, I confess I do not see w
ow that the President can take care that to
ie laws be faithfully executed." In the ui
line speech he said, "if any thing in its v<
Mure is executive, it must be that power st
hich is employed in superintending and m
xing that the laws are faithfully executed." ci
Again, .Mr. Madison said: "I think it ol
bsolutely necessary that the President m
lould have the power of removal from of- m
ce; it will make him in a peculiar manner ai
mt.. p i i i . i In:
ispoosiuiu ior u?eir ceiHiuer, and suojeci mm ui
i impeachment himself, if he suffer them to lil
irpetrate, with impunity, high crimes and bi
lisdcmcanors against the United States, or ci
jglect to superintend their conduct so as to in
leek their excesses. On the constitution- a
ity of the declaration, I have no manner of d<
jbbt." tli
Mr. Giles, in a debate in 1802, upon the tli
idiciary bill, expressed the same opinion, di
fe said : , ui
"In relation to newspaper scribblers, Mr. th
?fferson once said, 'Let them stand undis- til
irbcd as monuments of the safety with in
hich error of opinion may be tolerated,
here reason is left free to combat it.' " th
Mr. Giles. "The President is authorized te
ithout limitation, to commission all the of- it
cers of the United States. The question v<
rises, bv what tenure ? The reply is, acording
to his pleasure or discretion. It u]
as not difficult to foresee that,* if the Presi- a
ent was fully empowered to commission as ai
e pleased, he would commission during his r
lcasurc. The Legislature has no more T
ontrol over an officer who holds an Execu- pi
ve commission, during tnc pleasure ot tne u<
'resident, than over a judicial officer, hold, ai
ig his office during good behavior?the c<
smedy given by the Constitution being the
ame in both cases, to wit, impeachment, pi
Cor is there any reason why the office of in
ic one should be less subject to the discreon
of the Legislature than the office of the th
titer: and it seems to be universally agreed tx
lat, although the Legislature cannot de- vi
rive an Executive officer of his office in di
ny other way than by impeachment during te
ic continuance of such office, yet the of- pi
ce is always subject to he abolished. Tiie
ame reasoning will hold with equal force D
inspecting a judge and a judicial officer, gi
'he reason why the Executive is proscri- re
i ^ ? * t i il.
ea irom me removal ox a juage, is, 10 se- ui
ure to the judge the complete independence 01
f the President, who is not responsible for fo
le discharge of judicial duties; but the re- th
loval is perfectly correct in the case of an a
Executive officer, because the President is hi
ighly responsible for the due discbarge of in
kxeutive duties. The Legislature is not la
esponsible for either, and, of course, stands tii
i the same constitutional relation to both, ai
?hcrc is the same remedy against both? In
niDcaclimcDt.'" v<
The late eminent Judge Tucker, of Vir- gi
;inia, expressed the same opinion. In the ai
ppendix to his Commentary upon Black- in
tone, he said :
''The Constitution has made ample proision
for his aid in these respects, by as- "
igning to him Ministers, to whom the con- c;
net of each of the Executive Departments at
ijay be committed, from whom he may re- ti<
uire aTl necessary information, as also their n
pinions, in writing, upon any subject rela- c<
ing to the duties ol their respective offices; b;
,nd whom he may, moreover, remove at w
ileasure:" g
In further support of this claim of consti- p]
utional power for the Executive, I here p<
piote from Mr. Calhoun's speech upon the p:
emoval of the deposited, in 1834. In that tl
ipeecli ho said : j it
I '.ytinot doubt that the resident has.! tr
I
/ ^
mder the Constitution, the right of removal
rom office; nor can I doubt that the power
>f removal, wherever it exists, does, from
lecessity, involve the power of general suervision;
nor can I doubt that it might be
onstitutionally exercised in reference to the
eposites. Reverse the present case. Supose
the late Secretary, instead of being
gainst, had been in favor of the removal,
nd that the President, instead of for, had
een against it, deeming their removal not
illy inexpedient, but, under the circumstanos,
illegal, would any man doubt that, under
Lich circumstances, he had a right to relovehis
Secretary; if it were thejonly means
f preventing tire removal of the deposites ?
lay, would it not have been his indispensaIc
duty to have removed him ? And had
e not, would he not have been universally
ad justly held responsible ?
In further support of this claim, I quote
om Mr. Clay's speech at Fowler's Garden,
i which while he declaimed against the
buse,Jby fair inference admitted the constiitional
power of removal.
lO Itt t?P itnl tlif> trf - I

icndous power of dismision, to(be exercised
?r the public good, and not to gratify any
rivate passions or purposes. It was conrred
to prevent the Public from suffering 1
irough faithless or incompetent officers,
was made summary, because if the slow
rocess of trial before a judicial tribunal
ere resorted to, the public might be greatinjured
during the progress, and prior to
ic decision of the case."
These opinions are founded upon the prinplc
that the President, being charged by
ic Constitution with the whole executive
jwer, is responsible to the country for the
jc aad faithful execution of the laws?his :
ith requires it at his hands. In support
rthis opinion, I quote from Mr. Jefferson's
tter to 3/onsieur Dc Tracy:
"While the tranquil and steady tenor of
jr single Executive during a course of
ranty-two years of the most tempestuous 1
mes the history of the world has ever pre;nted,
gives a rational hope that this impcr- 1
nt nroblem ?s nf lennrfh solved, aided bv

e counsels of a cabinet, heads of departicnt,
originally four, but now five, with
hom the President consults, either singly
r altogether, he has the benefit of their
isdom ond information, brings their views
i one centre, and produces a unity of action
id direction in all the branches of the (*o?mment.
The excellence of this conruction
of the executive power has already
lanifesteu itself here under veiy opposite
rcumstanccs. During the administration
f our first President, his cabinet of four
icmbers was equally divided by as marked
,1 opposition of principle as monarchists
id republicanism could bring into conictT""-Had
that cabinet been a directory,

ich other, and produced a state of absolute
iaction,. But the President heard with
almness the opinions and reasons of each,
scided the course to be pursued, and kept
ic Government steadily in it, unaffected by
ie agitation. The Public knew well the
ssensions of the cabinet, but never had an
aeasy thought on their account, because
ley knew also they had provided a resulting
power, which would keep the machine
i steady movement."
I also refer to Mr. Madison's opinion in
ie debate before referred to, and just quod.
I also refer to Judge Tucker's Comtentary
on Blackstone, appendix to 1st
i . i : l:~l t
Diume, pari i, in wuicu ucsuye:
"The true point of responsibility rests
pon the shortness of the period for which
President of the United States is elected;
nd the power which the People possess of
sjecting him at a succeeding election."
'he same able author says, "responsibility
jrsues him (the President) in every situa. i
an, whether active or passive, sleeping or
vake;" a sentiment, the truth of which is
Dnfirmfed by that unerring test, experience.
And to the opinion of Mr. Calhoun, exmessed
in a letter to Gen. Hamilton, 1829,
: which lie says :
"No relation can be more confidential
lan that between the President and mem?rs
of the cabinet, as his constitutional adeers,
charged as he is with the executive
ities of the Government, which were vesd
in a single person, to give energy and
omptness in execution."

sponsibility, and with that responsibility

itrageous to hold the President responsible
ir the faithful execution of the laws, and at
ie same time compel him to retain in office
set of unworthy officers, who would thwart
s views and resist his authority, prevent- g
the prompt and faithful execution of the
ws. I should have thought the construc511
of the Constitution, by its very authors,
id the uniform practice ever since, would ,
ivc settled this principle so far as to pre?ntanv
effort to change it by act of Confess.
In this, however, I am mistaken;
id this bill from the Senate has that object
i view.
* * * * * *
Among the many charges made to affect
the party,11 as the gentleman caHs it, is the
lucus system, which he says has been
lopted to control public sentiment, a pracco
which lie denounces with hold and unlitigateo'
severity. He makes reference to
jngressional caucusses, and its repudiation
y the Jackson party. I have hut a few
ords to answer upon this subject. Conressional
caticusses were for a long timo
ractised during the protracted contest for
ower between the old republican and federal
artics. The practice was introduced for
?e purpose of concentrating public sqntricnt
upon a single individual, to secure the
iumph of the principles of the party which
might be lost by division. All caucusses, i
conventions, or meetings of the dominant z
party have had the same object its view, i
Since the congressional caucus has been put s
down, conventions of delegates from the
People have been adopted, to effect the same ii
object. These are nil acts of the People, J
which they, or portions of them, be they I
many or few, have a right to do. The opposition
have pursued the same course.
They have had their State conventions, and tl
their national conventions, and their legis- ii
lative caucusscs. Even the Tennessee a
Legislature has recently nominated a can- p
didate for the Presidency. By what b
Jinfhnrifv. sir? NVkt in tlir? rlicplmrtrp nf nnv r b
legislative duty, certainly. No, sir, but of w
their own free will and accord. Sir, did p
not eleven highly honorable and intelligent ai
gentlemen, members of Congress, all from it
Tennessee, among them the honorable gen- tii
tleman himself, hold a meeting, and recommend
a candidate for the Presidency, and, fr
I do not doubt, honestly and sincerely ? ai
Why, then, is "the party" complained of di
for doing that which thev have a right to do? in
[Mr. Bell said that the eleven of the If
Tennessee delegation, to which the gentle- sc
man alluded, was a meeting of so mam' a
individuals, who met not to nominate Judge ol
White; they had no organization; they is
had no chairman, no secretary ; they kejtf si
no minutes, they adopted no resolution; ir
they publislied nothing; it was not intended w
that any thing should be published; they v,
only met as so many individuals to ascer- v<
it.. /? i _ 11 .1
lam uie views ot eacn otner; ana an tncy ui
did was to devise the means and corne to n
some virtual resolutions to make their sup- g
port of Judge White as effective as pos- 11
sible.] a
It is true, sir, they had neither president
nor secretary, yet their object was the same., v
They intended to nominate and recommend ^
a candidate for the Presidency, and did so, K
and this is all the caucusses or conventions p
do. I am not complaining of the act, for t!
the gentlemen did what they had a right to o
do. I only claim that the party with which tl
I act shall not be denounced by gentlemen ti
who have done the very same thing in ef- ir
feet, if not in form. Tile paraphernalia of c
president an ! secretary does not alter the o
object in view. Now, sir, whether eleven
gentlemen, however honorable and respectable,
or six hundred, have the greater right
to nominate a candidate, I leave to the w
American People to decide. But it seems if
the Baltimore Convention is the devoted ?
victim of every possible denunciation. The I
recommendation of the Baltimore Convcn- e
tion stands upon the same footing with all ^
other like meetings, dependent for the force c
of its recommendation upon the character 0
and principles of tho nominee. But, sir, n
how long has a Baltimore Convention and r:
its nominee been odious in the State of Ten- tl
nesaee ? I find a meeting was held in the f
city of Nashville in 1832, in which the fol- n
lowing resolutions were adopted in favor of *P

sider it wise and just to act ir. concert with
our fellow-citizens of the United States, ?

Administration, and who are friendly to the a

" If there be one political evil which pre- P
eminently afflicts the country, it is angry ?
contentions and divisions growing out of no ^
differences of opinion as regards principles v
of national policy, but such as are based v
upon personal considerations?likes and ^
dislikes of political aspirants. This evil
we desire to avoid. . w
" We desire to aid in the elevation of a ?
citizen to this office, who is honest, discreet, r.
and talented, (Mr. Van Buren,) firm of pur- 0
pose, experienced as a statesman, and digni- h
tied as a man; who the country, not him- *1
self, will serve; one who, by his past con- P
nt ohnlf hnvn nrnron that he will advocate v
rind sustain, if elected, the political doctrines ?
we profess."
These resolutions embrace all tiie reasons ^
upon which the Baltimore Convention was Sl
called. 1
Another meeting was held at the same P
place in 1835, in which the following rc- r
solutions against the Baltimore Convention a
and Martin Van Buret), were passed. ?
" Resolved, That, in the opinion of this
meeting, a system, of controlling elections E
to all high and important public trusts and c
offices, by caucus nomination, would be a
violation of tlie spirit of the Constitution;
that it would inevitably lead to frequent 1
combinations between a few self-appointed t<
leaders, of a party, to co-operate in all their t;
movements, and to accommodate lheir S
principles to the single object of obtaining 1c
power, and of sharing among themselves fi
and their partisans the offices and entire b
patronage of the Government; and that d
such a system, when once sanctioned by e
the acquiescence of the People, and put into h
full operation in a majority of the States of ?
this Union, will be fatal to Liberty itself, t(
lt Therefore, in opposing the system of b
caucus nominations, and in opposing the \\
election of MARTIN VAN BUREN, who c
is avowedly the candidate of that system, F
and cf those who secK to make it permanent, 5

Mr. Hell said the nomination of Mr. >

ae Vice Presidency, was the act of a few l
idividuals, and one which gave consider- .

7 From the London Morning HerdUL
U1 stated to you, in a former letter^ that
iere is an American squadron expected
ere, to consist of*the North CarcAna,
un ship, Potomac and United States, frig
tes, John Adams, corvette* and two other
mailer vessels. Gn their arrival, the coralodore
is to shift his flag from the Constituon
(now in this port) totlie North Carolina,
.^he ostensible object for which they come
; the protection of their trade in the event of
war with France; but it is believed, upon
cry solid ground, that the purposaarmect at
; far different. The Uirited States Government
has been long endeavoring to induce
ie Emperor of Morocco to sell one of his
nrt? tn thfim: and. in order to nut him in
ood humor, have made him presents, at
itfereut times, amounting altogetherfo the
alue of 150,000 dollars. The frequent
isits of the American ships of war. to the
loorish ports having begun to awaked in
ic minds of our rulers some suspicion ot
Hiat was going forward, and it being guess.
J that England would not fail to throw eeeY
obstacle in the way ot any arrangement
fthat nature, the Yankees (it is surmised)
ave only withdrawn their squadron from
ic Mediterranean in order to be able to
ursue their object in that quarter unobser- v
ed, by feigning to have given it up. The
Imfteror it seems, though for a long time
jluctant, on the plea that it would displease
'?1?J k-- ioMo.lv liAoriin to manifest
ajyiutiu, uao iiuiv.ilj ? ?. ?, ?
ome disposition to accede to the proposal,
"ho conclusion I drew from the above-staled
remises was, that our naval force in this
iver would be considerably strengthened;
nd the fact, which only came to my knowU
dgo subsequently, that some more ships of
lejine were in train of equipment in the
Iritish ports, appears to corroborate my
onjecture."
Steamboat Communication between the

?ken by the citizens of Utica to meet a
team boat communication between the Atmtic

Dake, and the Oneida and Oswego Rivrs.
The route from Oswego, about one
