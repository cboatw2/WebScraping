Repokts on free school-.?We ought
f curlier to have acknowledged the politencss
of Mr. A. II. Pemberton, State Prin
ter, in sending us a co;>y of a pamphlet
containing reports made to the Governor
from all the districts of the state 011 the
free school system, by commissioners appointed
by order of the legislature.
There prevails a very genera!, perhaps
a universal opinion throughout the state,
that the present Free school system greatly
needs revision; many seem to doubt
whether the advantages of the system as
at present administered, are an equivalent
for the expense. T;?e diversity of
vicwsjexprcssed in the reports before us is
evidence that the subjeei is one encompassed
with intrinsic difficulties not easily
overcome. In a population as -parse as
tliat of South Carolina, and among whom
there are >o lew parents enable to afford
an elementary education to their own
children, no system of public education,
intended only for the poor, can he adopted
which will not involve ail expense hearing
a large proportion to the number ot
persons educated. In most countries and
states where any general system of free
jsc}tools has been aJoplcd, ll is intended
to embrace the great bo.ly of children of
nil classes. Such a system however does
not seem suited to the slate of opinion
and feelii g in South Carolina; not because
there is any unwillinga; ts among
the rich to educate their ch.ldren in the
same schools with the children of tlic
p<K>r; but because evt ry body who can afford
it is determined to have the selection
and dis/jvssnl Irj, of teacht rs for his children
in his own hand>;orin the hands of
himself and ?i few neighbors. Few are
willing to let state officers choose teachers
for them: and still fewer would consent
to be taxed lor the education of all the
children of the slate, in addition lo bearing
the expense of educating their own.
T.ic. subject is one which calls for the
maturest reflection of the wisest men in
the state. Tne pamphlet before us ought
to be procured and read by every citizen
who feels an interest in the subject of g eneral
education.

A pubLc meeting was lit Id in e aaricstoa,
oil the 27th October, on the subject
of the irregularity with which the mails
are received in that city. The meeting
appointed the Hon. J- E. Holmes, member
of Congress from the city, a delegate,
to proceed forthwith to Washington City,
for the purpose of representing to the
Post OlHco Department, and to the Pres.
- idnU if necessary, the serious injury
which the city suiters from the great
irregularity, and frequcut failures of the
mail, and to seek a redress of the grievance.
YV ay the citizens of Charleston deem
it necessary to delegate a special messenger
to Washington, and win they suspect
it may he necessary to appeal to the

been applied to, and lias he turned a deaf
ear to the application? l)ors a conviction
prevail, from any cause, in so large
and respectable a community as Charleston,
that an abuse, mismanagement or
neglect, in a department of the government
so intimately connected with the
interests of the whole country can lie remedied
only bv sending special messengers
to the scat of Government?
A petition is about to lie sent to the
state legislature from "Charleston Neck"

A letter dated Union City (_l//c7i.)

now engraved in removing* the Pottawattn
my Indians across the Mississippi, and
seem to have much such a task of it as
they had in collecting and removing the
Cherokees from Georgia. The Indians
have betaken themselves to the woods
and come in only as they arc limited up
and brought in by force. They allege
tiiat the treaty under which tlioy are driven
from their homes was made by unauthorized
chiefs whom the agents of the
U. Suites had nude drunk, and "inveigled
I into a treaty.

The President is now on a visit to
New York and the Secretary of State is
on a visit to Georgia. Some of the Whigs
arc ungenerous enough to charge them
C O C)
with the design ofchoosing this particular
time to visit their homes, with a view
of exerting some influence on the election
for President in their respective states.?
Others hint that they have only been inI

Much excitement has just been produced
in the city of New York, first by
the Democrats charging the Whigs with
importing persons to vote at the New
( York elections; and then bv the Whigs
j alleging that leading Democrats had
! formed a conspiracy to fix upon them so
base a charge. Numerous afiiulavits have
been published by both parties, from all
j which it seems thut the Wmgs, suspecting
that the Democrats were about, to iin
port voters from Philadelphia to New York
in 1S3S and *3!) employed men from difj
ferent parts of Philadelphia to go 011 to
I New Y>?rk and attend the polls on the
' days of election in the different wards of
I the city, for the purpose of identifying
I and challenging such imported voters
: should they present the msclves. One of the
men employed by the New York Whigs to
riixro.ru tliown niini.ni Stiivoncnn
m Vy 1WC* } aiuiiivM s/kt i vii uvi j f
lately reported to loading Democrats that
! what lie was em j?!<.yed lo do was to ]>ro1
cure voters and not spies, and that several
! men of great respectability in both cities
, were implicated. H.s statement was pu!>. ,
: lished with his oitJi, afiirming its truth. ,
The Democrats, from Boston to Balti- ;
more, if not to Richmond, were now in
eestacies. Tuey had prouf of the corrup- |
lion which they had so long charged upon
the "llriiish Fnhr.il Whigs." In Boston
a hand bill was issued from the office )
of a leudi? g party paper, announcing I
the important and gratifying in intelli- '
gence, and staling that Gov. Seward of I
J New York had heon arrested for particii
pation in the corruption, and that Mr.
j Grinnel', m ml?cr of Congress, and seme
one e)>e hau runaway to escape arrest.
As soon as the publication of the Pctno;
crats Wiis made, all the Whigs implicated, I
I among whom was the Mayor of l'hilaj
dclphia, contradicted, oil oath, in the
public papers, the statements of Steven. 1
son- At this stage of the business a fellow
named Wontworth, who had also boon
t mployed in the work of procuring spies
| from Pniladelphin, publishes on oath a
statement that Air. Butler, Air. Iloyt the
collector of New York, and others had offered
him money, with the promise of office
from the President, if he would implicate
Gov. Seward and other leading
1 Whigs in tiie charge of hiring voters from
Philadelphia. The tables were now turned,
in the estimation at least ofthe Whigs.
Tnev consider no language too strong to
characterize so hase a conspiracy among .
men limit in ctftec to blast the character of
i honorable and honest men, and by
vile falsehood and purjury to affect,
and if t icy could, decide, the election of
of Chief mag strate for this Republic, or
rather for tinsaug ist Confederacy of Republics.
Rjt the triumph of the W
Mas as brief us had been that of tiicir opponents.
Ii appears now, from the testimony of
men more entitled to credit than Went
worth*liiai so tar trom *>emg ottered a bribe j
of either money orotfice, he asked for one
or Itoth, as a once for which he would rc- !
veal to lite Democrats the evil practices
in which lie alleged that he had himself
been engaged as the servant of the Whigs;
and that when the bribes were refused, he
refused to divulge t lie important sec-ets.
Tiie matter is still undergoing investigation,
and likely to end in smoke; and at
the same time to show that both parties
are more ready to suspect their opponents
of unfairness au?J corruption than
truth justifies.

Rare VcgCahie.?Mr. .John Miciikl,
whose uncommon success in the culture
! of fruit, and flowers uQd vegetables has
' often challenged out editorial commendation,
has entitled himself to the credit of
: introducing a new vegetable into our hor1
tic-t! tare. He r.\!iihiled <o !: > yesterday,
a fine specimen of the Yau Massicot, or
St. Domingo potatoe, raised in the open, air,
in his garden on the Neck. This potatoe
grows on a rich and luxuriant vines with
largeand beautiful heart shaped leaves, the
vines itself, and not the root, bearing the
fruit. We are told by Mr. M. that the
potatoe when cooked exhibits a bright
gamboge color, and is superior in flavor to
the Irish potatoe. Mr. M. has also succeeded
in raising this new vegetable from
the seed?the common mode of planting
it being by cuttings of the fruit.

More Indian Depredations.?A party of
Indians showed themselves at Col. Gam
blc's plantation at Wolaunee, in Jefferson
County, on Saturday last. They fired
upon a negro man, wounding hiin in the
hand, who effected his escape. They took
a negro woman, and forced her to accompany
them. But being surprised by meeting
a party of whites, they lied precipitately,
and the woman effected her escape.?
The humbugs were some few miles distant,
watching the progress of the election.

week on the Econfina in Washington
county the dwelling house of Mr. Isaiah
Jones, a surviving hero of the Revolution,
was burnt by the Indians. Mr. Jones is
the father of Wiley Jones whose wife and
child were murdered by the savages a few
weeks since. Their plantations were adjoining
each other. The house was vacant
at the time though the yells of the
Indians were heard at the house of Mr.
Robbins, where several families are still
collected for self defence.

AFFAIRS IN CENTRA?. ASIA.
The fo lowing is an extract of a letter in tin
London Morning Herald, dated
Hombat. June 23d.
The mod important Ind an intelligence fo
tho past month co.nes to us foil tho north-wes
frontier, and is as unsatisfactory as may be.j
fut whole of the provinces lately overrun tv
the armies under Lord Kcane, Sir W. Cotton. I
General Welstnne, are in a state of insuboiduia. '
tion or open war. Not Oily h:ive outrageous
acts of violence been committed in almost every j
quarter of Buiochistun, Afghanistan, and Bokar- i
ra, where the frror of British Anna has most)
recently b?en experienced, but the long trail- ]
quilized R jipo'Uan statrs of Jezpnor. and Joudpoor,
on the Delhi frontier.', have been seized j 1
with a apirit of insubordination. The co iduc* ;
of our now al'y, tho Shah Soojali, meanwhile
i is as u irked, and unwise as possible. His hang,
ty and overbearing demeanour, while attendant '
on the army, who.-e huyone s were to place him
on the throne, disgusted every British officer j
who came in contact with him} while his low
and brutal sensuality, and tho vile creeping vices
of Ins character, excited universal contempt,
j Personally this pitiable prince, expelled for misconduct
by his subjects, and restored from exile j (
I to his native throne by 9! rangers, did nothing to ( (
c mediate his people, to strengthen his authority. ; (
or achieve his inder endcnceof English aid. Tho j .
exactions of his predecessor, Dost Muhoinmcd, I
{ in the shape of tux ilion. seem not only to have | j
, been moderate in thoinsclvos, but were submitted : .
: to with cli*."rfulne.?s, when to expend*din public |
j irnprovemcnls. So soon as tho Shah Soojah ,
came into power, he ko increased the put lie
burdens thai one half tl the bazars were inline- .
dialely t>hut up. The money.", thus extorted were ,
| wasted in sensual indulgence. Harems, such as j i
oriental imaginations alone can fancy, are being 1
! now erected; and tha engineers, th? workmen, j .
! and the resources which ought to be employ* <i ,
! in the public service, are occupied in providing ,
; luxuries and expensive palaces fur a Sovereign !

The account of the falling of a part of !
Mount Ararat shaken down by an earthquake
, with a terrible destruction of human life is
'continued. The St Petersburg Abeille de. J
Nord of September 11th publishes the ioli
lowing letter, dated Tifllis, August 13tli:
"Vou have, doubtless heard, of the terrible
i earthquake of Mount Ararat which has total y
!d?stroved the town of Makitcheman, d*ma-|
! god all the buildings at Erivan, and devastated
! the two districts of Sliarour and Souruia o in [
Armenia All 'lie villages in those districts |
have been destroyed. The ear'h is rent mi
such a manner, that all the cotton and rice \
plantations have perished for want of water? I
But the most awful event has taken place in j
the neigborhood of Mount. Ararat. A conoid, i
cralde rock was loosened from the mountain, 1
and destroyed every thing in its way f >r the |
distance of seven wersts, (nearly five English ;
Utiles.)
Among others, the great village of Akhouli
has had the fate ot Uerculancum and Pompeii.
Above one thousand inhabitants were buried
Urtd"r heaps of rocks. A thick fluid, which
afterwards became a river, ran from the
interior of the mountain wh'ch was opened,
and fillowing the same direction, swept over
the rums, and carried with it the corpses of
the unlorlunate inhabitants of Akhouli, the
dead animals &c. The shock continued to ,
he feltev-ry day in the above mentioned dis-'
tricts and entirely laid them waste; then the '
shocks became less frequent. Ararat is not ;

awakened by two violent subterraneous com- i

A. WKKKLY JOURNAL. .
To be devoted to the dissemination of Scottish
Intelligence, &c. thoiiohout the
Uuiled Slates and Canada. -- .
Breathes there a man with soul so dead,
Who never to himself hath snid,
This is my ov n, my native land,
Scr?TT.
A paper devoted to thi? dissemina ion of
national intelligence, muftt necessarily look,
for support from those interested by nativiy
or descent; but, as a record of the pas*iu?|fevents
of any country cannot tad, if careftjlly
prepared, occasionally to interest or instruct'
the g^n?raj. reader,it is hoped our journal may
meet with a favorable reception front thir
class while the fo/mey, to be without it, would1
argue a degree of indifference, happily inc<>i??
sistcnt with that Amor Patr>e, so proverbially
characteristic of our count ry^ne'iv? .
Emigration from Scot!wufhas been so coiutinous
during the last fc?rty years, as to liav?"
given rise to a very numerous and important
class of the population of those communities;-'
' ne which we cannot for a in< ment-douht, are*
as univ' raally desirous of possessing, as they
are capable of sustaining, a journal devoted to
their national ryiupailues?an independent
medium of communication with their native
land ; now the more desirable, as steam
navigaMon offers opportunities so freqWcnt,
regular and speedy, ot acq iring a knowledge
ot passing events?ere lime rubs ihetii of ikeir
interest.
In tins country, where the French, German
and English population, sustain their respect*
ive papers?the publication of such a periodical
is a debt we really owe to the honor of the
Scottish nation and character; and the sub*
scriher chi< flly influenced by this conviction,
in preparing so desirable an object for his
countrymen, feels their patriotism Will be his
protection, while his anxiety wi I he to present
matter at ail times pure and ynexceptionable
i and worthy the high literary reputation ot his
country.
'I he Scottish Pairiot will appear early in
1H41 neatly printed, in a form wel! fitted for
binding?and will present a weekly retrospect
of general Scottish intelligence?a digest -of
Scottish literature?notices of new publications,
&,c.?of mien-sting movements in the
church?universities?courts of law?discover)
ce in pcience?progress in the arts?reports
of deaths?marriages?bankruptcies, die.?
and interesting miscellany, gleaned from every
source?home and abroad.
A piece of Scottish music will also be appended,
in such a manner as will adml of its
: being separately bound if desired. The whole
it is hoped, will form a journal equal in neatness
and interest to any existing periodical.

American Phrenological
Journal.
In the present elate of the pwbic mind,,
probably no other instrument or mean* what*
ever, can be rendered efficacious in promulgaiimj,
defending, and establishing the prin.
nples o Phrenology, as a well conducted
Journal It is unnecessary to state the particu'ar
advantages which a regular periodical,
possesses over all other agencies; or to urge
the imjiortance of having, in this country, sue'*
a medium as it affords to make known to the
public the facts and principles of the science.
The objects of this Journal arc to preserve
from oblivion the must interesting of the very
numerous facts confirmatory and illustrative
the truth of phrenology; to record the history
and progress of the science; to show its true
bearings on the education (ph)si<ial, intcHeiv
tual, and moral); on the nature and treatment
" - - ' - 1 k
OI llisanuv; mi jurisjjf uunitr nn?i tnimiMi w^-~
i iflat;on; on mental and moial philosophy; and
to point out various applications to the ini?
{Movement ot the insutu:tons, maimers, aud
sysloms of society
Original et^ays on phrenological subjects
will form part of the Journal, aiul also reviews
of phrenological and anti-phrenological works;
aid, as often a* practicable, we shall transfer
to its pages, the best articles in the Ediohurg
Phrenological Journal. There are already en listed
a6 cuntribirors to the work, many of
the abk-6l writers and b st prenoiogists in the
country, as well as several lor< igo correspondents.
We hope, as it progresses, to embody
in its page6 nearly all the matter published on
the science which is of particular interest fo
the puiilic, or can be ol permanent value for future
refeience. Vv e shall frequently accoin
paijy our facts and d. I me a tions of character
rtitn il.uttr.uive cuts.
It is not with the desire or expectation ??f
g;un that ?t i6 offered to ihe community, hut
from far higher consideration*?from a desire
to know and to promtilate Iruih. It will be
obvious to all, that a woik of this character
must depend chiefly lor supjiori on the tolun'my
patronage and co.operatioiis of those who are
interested in the subject u discusses, and it in
hoped that the friends of the science will not
only encourage it by their own subscriptions
hut that'they will make eflbrts. to exteqd' its
.circolmioifin the various part6 of the country
w-here they may reside. 'No pains or expense
will be spared on the part of the proprietors to '
render the work worthy of a liberal support.
