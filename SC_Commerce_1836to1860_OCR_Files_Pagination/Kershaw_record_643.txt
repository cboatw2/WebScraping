Free Tr.tdr Forts a ml 'i't/rijj' Thrttrirr.?There
is, in a late number of the Now I laveu iloyister,
an aiimira!)lc article by Charles Ivor, a mechanic,
on the various ore at questions of public controversy.
Wo could wish that his liberal ami enlightened
views could penetrate the intellects
of our more distimrnislied men. What is said
011 the subject of the tari'K has an especial force.
"At first siirht," he says, "there is something
very captivating iti the theory of protection.?
The idea ofliciu;? independent, and of making

every imiij: i?>? ,,
ant sensation in the mind of a republican. I:
sounds so patriotic to talk about aiding Anicrican
enterprise, encouraging American industry,
and fostering American mumifact arcs. Aiid
then the idea of keeping all the specie in the
country; this is irresistible. (>, there is magic
in hard money, and it is so delightful to think
that protection will enable us to keep it all to
ourselves! Hut unfortunately this Chinese doctrine,
when weighed in the balance of reason, 1
is found wanting. When examined by the light ]
of facts, it is clearly seen to he a delusion.
"American industry is must encouraged when
it receives the largest reward. If some Yankee .
shouldjtakc a fancy to spend his lime and capital!
in cultivating tea and coilcc, and should so far ,
succeed as to raise, of an inferior quality the one
at an expense of five dollars, and the other at an
expense of fifty cents a pound, would Congress
be protecting American industry, should thoy
prohibit, by a heavy duty, the importation of foreign
tea and coffee, and thus compel our whole
population to buy these articles of this man at so '
exorbitant price? Would our industrious fel-1
low-citizens think it was encourgingtheir indus-1
trv. thus to make them labor five days for what I
' i-i?? I
they could before purchase with one nay s jauor,
and, after all, got a poorer article! Would it be
good policy thus to sustain this man in the prosecution
of an unprofitable business? Would
this be a judicious way of creating a home market?
Would it be any consolation to the farmer
to be told that this man bought the produce
of their farms? Would it satisfy the mechanics
to be told that the shoemaker had one or two
more customers for his shoes, and the, tailor for l
his coats? This is but one illustration of the
theory of protection. This shows the principle,!
and I leave the reader to apply it to other articles
which experience has taught us can be imported
from abroad cheaper than they can be raised at
home.
"The advocates of protection overlook this obvious
fact; all commerce is an exchange of commodities,
and irlien iceexchange American produels
for foreign manufactures, the latter are as j
much the result of American labor, as though j
made by American hands. In one caae, we make j
the article ourselves; in the order, we made or I
raise something else, that we exchange for it.?
The farmer's plow is an much the product of his j
industry, as if he made it himself. It would not
be more impolitic to compel a farmer to make his
own tools, than it is to compel a nation to depend
altogether upon its own resources.
-"A division of labor has ever gone hand in I
hand with civilization and social improvement. J
The farther it is carried, the greater is the na
tional wealth, and the comloris anu luint-mvii.

with a less amount of labor, and are consequently

now be suffering all the horrors of a bloody war.
The intelligent philanthropist will ever be found
among the advocates of free trade. The interests
of humanity demand that all obstacles shall
be removed; that the hills shall be levelled and
the valleys raised."
He then closes with the following statement
of facts:
"1. It is a fact, that for the last 20, years, !
(from 1821 to 1810 inclusive?full returns for '
1811 not having yet been published,) the imporls
of specie into the United States, from all coun-1
tries, exceed the exports by more than fifty millions
of dollars.
2. It is a fact, that estimating the value of1
American goods at the prices they brought in j
the foreign market, (ireat Britain and her co!onies
received from us one hundred millions of
dollars worth of goods more, during the last 20 j
years, than we received from thctn.
3. It is a fact, that during this same period of
twenty years, our imports of specie from Great
Britain and Ireland exceed our exports of the;
same by 8100,70S.
4. It is a fact, that during the highest tariff we
ever had, from the year 1820 to 1832 inclusive, j
we imported specie from Great Britain and Ire-1
land to the amount of $408,471, and exported j
specie to those countries to the amount of $4,070,351.
5. It is a fact, that when specie is worth more
in our own than in other countries, it will be
brought here; and when worth less, it will leave
us; and no earthly power can prevent it.
G. It is a fact, that the banks have no peculiar
claim upon the specie of the country, and that A.
has as good a right to buy English broadcloth
with his gold, as B. has with his llour or pork.
7, It is a fact, that specie is hut a commodity,
like wheat or broadcloth, and utiles there is
'something rotten in Denmark," no more evil
will result from the exportation of the former,
than would follow from the exportation of the
latter.
8. It is a fact, that those honest and well meaning
citizens who signed their names to a certain
"Notice," calling a meeting of the friends ol
protection, and containing an assertion, that a
protective tariff was necessary "to save the necessity
of exporting from ten to twenty million
dollars annually in specie to settle balances,"
were grossly humbugged and signed their names
to a falsehood.
!). It is a fact, that a uniform duty of 20 per
cent, levied upon a home valuation as authorized
by the Compromise Act, will give our manufactuers
a superiority in our own market of at least
25 percent., and those of them who cannot comonte
successfully witli foreigners aided hv such
a protection, had better exchange a losin<r business
for a profitable one, with as little delay as
possible.
10. It is a fact, flint the influence of large
manufacturing establishments upon the public
welfare and happiness, is not so much superior
to that of all oilier kinds of business as to render
it either pel tic or just to tax the latter for their
support.
11. It is a fact, that our fathers, instead of
"living under the shade of the vine and tig tree"
of protection in England, were glad to lly from
it; and thousands and tci.s of thousands are annually
following their example, fur the purpose
of enjoying the sun shine of free trade in Aincri- t
ca. (
12. It is a fact, that unless we bring home i
more from foreign countries than wo carry to t
them, we shall lie doing a loosing business. ]
! !. It is a fact, that it the "Home League" ;
frniornitv succeeded in restoring the dead body i
of protection to life, the writer will lie forced to i
admit, that iborc is Jess intelligence among the I
people of America than lie had supposed. f

all tlieir talk about honor and the lofty credit of |?'
the country, that in times like these, sagacious <
capitalists would nottrust tlieir money where M
they saw no legitimate tangible provision by '
which they were to he secured.
Mr. Preston followed at. great length, declar- 1
ing that the present condition of the country was I
owing to the inal-managemcnl of the party ejected
from power, and that the loan was mainly to
provide for the debts created by that party, lie i
admitted, however, that the Distribution policy i
was wrong, and that the land revenue must be
brought back to the uses of the government, and i
he pledged himself to vote for it: but he would |
not jeopard the bill by sending it back to the ,

mcnt of Mr. Walker to pledge the lands for the ; I
payment of the debt and interest on the new loan, :!
was rejected. Messrs. Archer and Preston,' I
who voted for that identical proposition but a <
few days since, as proposed by Mr. Rive's reso- t

Mr. l'rcston replied to Mr. W. and ran back t
into the old slang about the amount expended by (
the late Administration, by way of calling oil'at-1 (

ty now in power. Hut lie forgot to mention the (
notorious fact the Whig part}', during Mr. Van (
Huron's administration, constantly labored to in- ]
crease the appropriations beyond the estimates of, \
the Executive olliccrs, and in this way to create \
the expenditures, which it was their policy to ac- i
cumulate to the utmost. It was their policy l
then, to create a debt, as it is now, that their j
great measures of a high tarifl'and .National Hank
might be called for?the one to provide the interest?tlie
other to impart credit, and facilities
to favor the negotiation of loans?and both to r
build up the molded power and party in the cotm- |

Machiavclian policy of the Whigs. We shall j
hereafter recur to the subject to show that the t
policy which they have now given the reins to, (
being in power, they spurred on the utmost, t
when out of power. Let the nation never forget j t
that Vv lug policy requires a debt, a bank, a litrtj); j'

The Whig-shave promised,!?yretrcnchmoii! and !

as good terms as it might have heen had during j
l lie last Administration! And if so, why would,
ihey extend a large loan which they say can now

years!
The Whigs voted down all the public good
which was plainly in the scope of Mr. 15cnloii\s j
imcndinent. j
Mr. J'enton succeeded, by a solitary vote, in j
[tarrying his second amendment, which was to !

of paper, based 011 the public faith alone,

Tiio bill comes upon its passage to-morrow.? J
ft is understood tliat Mr. Calhoun will make a
final speech against it.?lb.
Wo lake the following sensible remarks from
ihc money article of the New York Herald, of
I he 1st inst:
The prospect of any change in the character of
the stock market has been much overshadowed
by the refusal of Congress, under the influence
ol faction,to appropriate the proceeds of the
public land to the redemption of the hum which
must ho contracted to mcef the necessiticrfof the
federal government. Tint loan coming upon
the market without any specific fund for its re
demption, will he a cause of discredit that will
crush all alike. No stocks can Mislain themselves
while the federal government is in disrrcilil.
The loan of the extra so imi has not been negotiated,
hocauso there was no means set apart
for its rodcinniion. The Treasury notes tire at a
heavy discount, hecau-c of tiie improbability of
their being promptly redeemed. The oniv manner
in wliicli they arc sustained at all, is by the
demtin! for duties. In this disastrous state ot
things party faction lias so far predominated in
I lie national I'ongro as to can -o a decided vote

it to the wrong ijuarter. The country must
probably remain in its disgraceful rendition until!
the people thunder through the ballot boxes j
lo its rescue, and to the support of the Chief'Ma- j

lo the fanner, the mechanic, the merchant, or the

"Wc war not against tho religion of Mexico,"
a.s our President has justly remarked. What
we contend for andtfll we do contend for in regard
to this matter is, that all sects he placed

Catholics to enjoy equal rights and privileges
with all others, lntt not that theirs shall be tiicj
only system of religion tolerated in the government.

wiiirli the Mexican Dictator intends to exercise:
towards Texas inav he designated in a few!
words. As he has not the power to invade with!
any prospect, of .success, he intends "to molest" I
Texas as far as possible. This is plainly to be
evinced in his letter to (Jen. Hamilton, where;
he declares that "the last Mexican admini.-tra
tiosi diil neither what it could or should have:
done to molest,at least, those whom their apathy]
or carelessness convinced-- of their definitive]
safety." This single sentence, wo think, soives'
entirely the miotery that iias characterized the]
late movements at the West. Tim three parties
of Mexican troops that lately came into Texas

to promulgate the proclamation of Arista. The

Mr. day and Mr. Calhoun.?The Washing
Inn correspondent of the Philadelphia I'. X. Uitzclic
says:?
"An anecdote is told of the n;opt!n?y of Mr.
Clay and .Mr. Calliouii, after the former retired
from the Senate, which shows that political
strife, though it may for a while deaden the liner
feelings of Hie heart, cannot destroy them, cs"
pccially in those hearts that beat with generous
and manly sensibilities. As Mr. Clay was passing
towards the door to leave the Senate Chamber,
Mr. Calhoun met him?they had not spoken
!o each other for five years; but they now simultaneously
extended their hands, and rushed to
each other's arms; neither spoke, hut both wept.
At. length Mr. Clav said, on parting, "give-my
best regards to Mrs. Calhodo."" How muck
mere noble w.ns tins .reconciliation and parting",
; ban il l hey had separated looking defiance at
each other!
They had almost spent their lives together in
Congress, and at various times stood shoulder to <
shoulder, animated by patriotism and emulous
only of serving the country. Time had passed
over both, and the young had become old. One
was about to retire, ami both must ere long "sleep
t he sleep that hath no waking." The retirement
of the one would leave the ether with no companion
or rival of his younger day?, and it told
iiim emphatically that he too must" soon follow.
Thoirkts like these soften flic heart not wholly
indurated, and cause the fountain of generous
feelings to gush fort h?it came, and the twodistingui.
lied rivals and antagonists under the in!lue"cc
of these sympathies were drawn together.
Won id that tiicy had never been separated.
DEATH OF BISHOP ENGLAND.
Vv'e announce with unfeigned rogict the death
of this eminent and distinguished prelate. He
breathed hi.; last about 5 o'clock yesterday morning,
after a protracted and painful illness, in the
5lbh year oi his age. lie was a native of Ireland,
and for the last -J years resided in the city?
during which period he presided over the Dioccss
comprising the States of North Carolina,
South Carolina, and Georgia. He was distin
flushed lor strength of inmd, power of argument,
deep and various learning, and a bold and impressive
eloquence: and was justly ranked among th#
intellectual and literary ornaments of our city.?
A a pro! u:o, conducted the civil and ecclesia.-i.icaliiiiiiv
o.'iils church (tbo Roman Catholic)
vvi: ii coun.ii.iisi'i'o ability, and has left behind
j h!i:i iuany of religion and betievoi
lonco, tbo fruits of bis successful administration
and unwearied zeal. Devoted as lie was to the
intercuts of the Church to which he owed his
mitre, lie was yet a man of liberal principles and
feelings, alive to the impulses of public spirit,
and to the 1nlluenr.es of universal charity. During
bis long residence among us, his high and
merited iniluenco over his flock was ever exercised
for good, and his deportment was such as
to win for D:;:: the esteem and regard of the
community. Although his native country was
over green in his memory and dear to his hearty
his al legiencc to his adopted country was recognized
as his highest duty, as well ffoin inclination
as prinrijde. lie sympathized deeply with
the free institutions and the glorious destinies of
tIjo American Union, valuing it as the home of
his oppressed and exiled fellowcountryman, and
ihe chosen temple of rational liberty. Of the
South he was a true friend and an able champion;
fearlessly throwing the weight of his char*
actor, influence and intellect, in favor of her
I much misunderstood and much reviled domestic
1 in. Ii!u!ions, and vindicating them both at home
; ami ahroul fn the death of one thus eminent in
i hie calling and useful in his generation, his
Church has sustained a loss, which can scarcely
be repaired, am! our community owns the be1
rcaveuionl of a gifted and valued citizen,
