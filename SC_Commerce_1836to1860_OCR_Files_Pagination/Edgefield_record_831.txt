c Fole in:aD ngricultural and 6commercia
point of view;
To a soil of inexhaustible fertility, it
unites a genial and healthy climate, and is
,destined, ata -day not distant, to make
*farge contributions to the commerce of the
world. Its territory is separated from the
United States. in -part. by an imaginary
line, and by the river Sabine, for a distance
of 310 miles; and its productions are the
same with those of many of the contiguous
States of the Union. Such is the country,
such are its inhabitants, and such its capa
cities to add to the general wealth of the
Union. As to the latter, it may be safely
asserted, that in the magnitude of its pro.
ductions, it will equal, under the protecting
care of this Government, .if it- does not
surpass, the combined production of many.
States of- the confederacy. A new and
powerful impulse will thus be given to the
navigating interest:of the country, 'which
will be chiefly engrossed by our fellow
citizens of the Eastern and- Middle States,
who have already attained a remarkable
degree of posperity by the partial monop
oly they have-enjoyed of the carrying trade
of the Union; particularly the coastwise
trade, which this new acquisition is des
tined in time, and that not distant, to
swell to a magnitude which cannot easily
be computed, while the addition made to
the boundaries of the home market, thus
secured to their mining, manufacturing.
and mechanical skill and industry, will be
of a character the most commanding and
important.
Such are some of the many advantages
which will accrue to the Eastern and Mid
dle States by the ratification of the treaty
--advantages, the extent of which it is im
possible to estimate with accuracy or pro
perly to appreciate. Texas being adapted
to the culture of cotton, sugar, and rice,
and devoting most of her energies to the
raising of these productions, will open an
extensive market to the western States, in
the important articles of beef, pork, horses,
mules, &c. as well as its breadstuffs. At
the same time, the Southern and South
western States will find, in the fact of an
nexation, protection and security to their
peace and tranquillity, as well against all.
domestic as foreign efforts to disturb them;
thus consecrating anew the Union of the
States, and holding out the promise of its
perpetual duration.
Thus, at the same time that the tide of
public prosperity is greatly swollen, an ap
peal, of what appears to the Executive to
be of an imposing, if not of a resistless
character, is made to the interests of every
portion of the country. Agriculture, which
would have a new and -extensive market
opened for its produce; commerpe, whose
ships would be freighted with the rich pro
ductions of en extensive andfertile region ;
and the mechanical arts, in all their va
rious ramifications, would seem to unite in'
one universal demand for the ratification
of tbe treaty.
But important as these considerations
may appear, they are to be regarded as but
secondary to others Texas, for reasons
deemed sufficient by herself, threw off her
dependence on Mexico,as far back as 1836,
and consummated her independence by
the battle of San .facinto, in the same year ;
since which period, Mexico has attempted,
no serious invasion of her territory ; but
the contest has assumed features of a were
border war, characterised by acts revolting
to humanity. In the year 1836 Texas
adopted her constitution, under which she
has existed nsa sovereign power everainee,
having been recognised as such by many
of the principal powers of the world ; and
contemporaneously with its ad option by a
solemn vote of her people, embracing all
her population but ninety-three persons,
declared her anxious desire to be admitted -
into association with the United States as
a portion of their territory. This vote, thus
solemnly taken, has never been reversed
and now, by the action of her .constituted
authorities, sustained as it is by popular
sentiment, she reallirms her desire for an
nexation. This course has been adopted
by her, without the employment of any
sinister measureson the part of this govern
ment: No intrigue has been set on foot to
aecomplish it. Texas herself will, it, and
the Executive of the United States, con
curring with her, has seen no sufficient
reason to avoid the consummation of an
act esteemed to be so desirable by both. It
cannot be denied, that Texas is greatly de
pressed in her energies by her long-protrac
ted war with Mexico. Under these cir
cnmstances, it is bat natural that she
should seek for safety and repose under the
protection ofesome stronger power; and it
is egnally, so that her people should turn
to the United States, the land of their birth,
in the first instance, in the pursuit of such
protection.-She has often before made
known her wishes; bat her advances have,
to this time, been repelled. The Executive
'of the United States sees no longer any
cause for pturstaing such a course. The
hazard of now defeating her wishes may
be ofithe most-fatal tendency. It might
lead, amid spost itiably would, to such an
eatire alienation ofsentument and feeling
as would inevitablyiiiduce her to look
elsewhere for aid, gut force her either to
eater into dangerous alliances with other
nations, who, looking with more wisdom
to their ipterests, would, it is fairly to be
presumed, readily adopt such expedients;
or she would hold out the proffer of discri
minating duties in trade and commerce, in
order to secure the necessary assistance.
Whatever step she might adopt, looking to
thIs object, would prove disastrous, in the

to -guard Iheir border. inhabitants against
hostile inroads, so easily excited on the
parts of the numerous and warlike, tribes
of [Idians dwelling in their neighborhood.
Texas would 'undoubtedly be" unable, for
many years to come, if at any time, to re
sist, unaided.and alone, the militiry pow
er of the United States ; but it is not, x-_
travagant to suppose that nations reaping
a rich harvest from her trade, 'secured to
them by advantageous' treaties, 'would be
induced to take part with her in any con
flict with us, from the strongest considera
tions of 'public& policy. -Such a 'state of
things might subject to devastation the ter
ritory ofeogtinuous States, and would cost
the country; - in a single campaign, more
treasure, thrice told over, than-is stipulated
to be paid and reimbursed by the treaty
now proposed for ratification. 1 will not
permit myself to dwell on this view of the
subject. Consequences of. fatal character,
to the peace of the Union- and even to the
preservation of the Union itself, might be
dwelt upon. They will not, however, fail
to occur to the mind of the Senate and of
the country. Nor do I - indulge in any
vague conjectures of the future. The do
cuments now transmitted "along~ with the
treaty, lead to the conclusion, as inevita
ble, that if the boon now tendered be re
jected, Texas will seek for the friendship
of others.
'In contemplating such a contingency, it
cannot be overlooked that the U. States
are already almost surrounded by the pos
sessions of European powers.-The Can
adas, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.
the islands in the American. seas, with
Texas, trammelled by treaties of alliance,
or of a commercial character, differng in
policy from that of the-United States,would
complete the circle. Texas voluntarily
steps forth, upon terms of the most perfect
honor to ask to be annexed to the Union.
As an independent sovereignty, her right
to do this is unquestionable. In doing so,
she gives no cause of umbrage to any other
power; her people desire it, and there is
no slavish transfer of her sovereignty and
independence. She has for eight years
maintained her independence against all
eforts to subdue her. She has been re
cognised as independent by many of the
most prominent of the family of nations,
and that recognition, so far as they are
concerned, places her in a position, with
out giving any just umbrage to them, to
surrender her sovereignty at her own will
and pleasure. The United States, actua
ted evermore by a spirit of justice, has de
sired, by the stipulation of the treaty, to
render justice to all. They 'have made
provision for the payment of the public
debt of Texas. We look to her ample and
fertile domain as the certain means of ac
complishing this; but this is a matter be
tween the United States and Texas and
with which other' governments have no
thing to do. Our right to receive the rich
grant tendered by Texas is perfect; and
this government should hot having due res
pect either to its own honor or its own in
terests, permit its course of policy to be in
terrupted by the interference of other pow
.ers, even if such interference was threaten
ed. The quesiion is one purely American.
In the acquisition, while we abstain most
carefully from all tbat could interrupt the
public peace, wve claim the right to exer
cite a due regard to our own. This go.
vernment cannot, consistently with its ho
nor, permit any such interference. With
equal, if not greater propriety, might the
United States demand of other govern
ments to surrender their numerous and
valuable acq6isitions, made in time past,
at numberldss places on the surface of the
globe, where'by they have added to their
power and enlarge'd their resources.
To Mexico. the Executive is disposed
to pursue a course concillatory in its char
acter, and at the same time to render her
the most ample justice, by conventions
and stipulations not inconsistent with the
rights and dignity of the government. It
is actuated by no spirit of unjust aggran
disement, but looks only to its own securi
ty. It has made known to Mexico, at
several periods, its extreme anxiety to wit
ness the termination of hostilities between
that country and Texas. Its wishes, how
ever, have been entirely disregarded. It
has ever been ready to urge an adjustment
of the dispute upon terms mutually advan
tageous to both. It will be ready at all
times to hear and discuss any claims Mex
ico may think she has on the justice of the
United States, and to adjust any that may
be deemed to he so on the most liberal
terms. There is no desire on the part of
the Executive to wouad her pride, or af
fect injuriously her interest; but, at the
same time, it caninot compromit by any
delay in its action the essential interests of
the United States. Mexico has no right to
ask or expect this of us-we deal rightful
ly with Texas as an independent power.
The war which has been waged for eight
yearn has resulted only in the conviction,
with all othess than herself, that Texas
cannot be reconquered. I cannot but re
peat the opinion, expressed in my message
at the opening of Congress, that it is time
it had ceased. The Executive, while it
conld, not look upon its longer continuance
without the greatest uneasiness, has never
theless, for all past time, preserved a course
of strict neutrality. 'It could not be igno
rant of the fact of the exhaustion which a
war of so long a duration had produeed.
Least of all was it ignorant of the anxiety
of other powers to induce Mexico to enter
into terma of reconciliation with Texas,
which,' affecting the domestic instititions
of Texas, would operate most injurionsly
upon the' United States, and might most
.d giib.the fact, th'althouogireigi

State: The Executie was also aware of
the fact, that formidabro associations of
persons, the subjects of-foreign powers,
existed, who were directing their utmost
efiorts to the accomplishment of-this ob
ject. To these conclusions it was inevita
bly brought by the documents now sub
mitted to the Senate. I-repeat, the Exe
cutivd saw Texas in a :state of almost
hopeless exhaustion, and the question was
narrowed down to the simple proposition,
whether the United States should accept
the boon of annexation on fair and liberal
terms, or by .refusing to do so, force Texas
to seek a refuge in the arms of some other
power, either through a treaty of alliance,
offensive and defensive, or the adoption of
some other expedient, whieh might virtu
ally make her tributary to such power,
and dependent upon it for all future time.
The Executive has full reason to believe
that such would have been the result, in
the.event either of unnecessary delay in
the ratification, or of the :rejection of the
proposed treaty.
In full view then, of tie highest public
duty, and as a measure of security against
evils incalculably great, th'e Executive has
entered into the negotiation. the fruits of
which are now submitted to the Senate.
Independent of the urgent reasons wbic'h
existed for the step it had taken, it might
safely invoke the fact, which it confident
ally believes, that there exists no civilized
government on earth, having a voluntary
tender made it ofa domain so rich and fer
tile, so replete with all that can add to na
iunal greatness and wealth, and so neces
sary to its peace and safety, that would re
ject the offer. Nor are other powers, Mexi
co inclusive, lilkely, in any degree, to be
injurously affected by the ratification of
the treaty. The prosperity of Texas- will
be equally interesting to all; in the increase
of the general commerce of the world, that
prosperity will be secured by annexation.
But one view of the, subject remains to
be presented; It grows out of the proposed
enlargement of our territory. From this
I am free to confess, I see no danger. The
federative systein is susceptible of the
greatest extension compatible with- the
ability of the representation of the'most dis
tant state of Tetkitory to reach the seat of
government in time to participate in the
functions of legislation, and to make
known the wants-of the constituent body.
Our confederated'republic consisted origi
nally of thirteen niembers. It now consists
of twice that nuthber, while applications
are before Congtess to permit other addi
tions.
This. addition of pew States has served
to strengthen rather than to weaken the
Union. New int-ests have sprung up,
which require the'inited power of all,
through the action-o' the common govern
ment to protect and defend upon the high
seas and in foreign parts. Each State
commits, with perfect security. to that com
mon government; those great interests
growing out of ourrelations with other na
tions of the world, and which equally in
volve the good of aill the States. Its do
mestic concerns are loeft to its owvn exclusive
management.
But if there were any force in the objec
tion. it would seem'to require an immediate
abandonment of- territorial posseesions
which lie in the distance and stretch to a
far-off sea; and yet no one would be found,
it is believed, ready to recommend such an
abandonment. Texas lies at our ve-ry doors
and in our immediate vicinity.
Under every view which I have been
able to take of the subject, I think that the
interests of our common constituents, the
people of all the States, and a love of the
Union, left the Executive no other alterna
tive than to negotiate the treaty. The high
and solemn duty ef ratifying or rejecting it,
is wisely devolved on the Senate by the
Constitution of thie United States.

as little to-follow him wherever he leads,
so long as they believe the-course ends in

were... We have seen them desert their
friends and go over to their enemies before
now-but it would indeed seem that the
question of Texas is too manifestly a great
urgent and vital question, to allow any fear
how the Southern people will treat it. The
best authorities assure us in a way to leave
scarce a doubt, that if Texas is rejected
now, it is lost to us entirely,-that the im
mediate consequence will be a British Al.
liance-with conditions and consequences
such as will impair the-safety of the Sonth
era States and make Texas the fruitful
source of future disturbance and mischief.
The Senate will act with this knowledge
before them, and if they sacrifice Texas, it
will be for President-making, and nothing
else. They will leave repentance for a
time when it will be too late. We shall
not touch Mr. Clay's argument to day
there is precious little of it, but what there
is we will notice to-morrow. We are thank
ful at- least for knowing where Mr. Clay
is, however much regret and mortification
we rnay feel at seeing him following in the
train of New England fanaticism.

says : "We have private information,
from- a source which we cannot discredit,
that President Tyler has ordered a de

St. Louis to the Sobine, preparatory to op

Mexico is about to invade Texas, and this

OBITUIARY.
-Departed this life on the 17th of April, Mrs.
SARAN MARTIx, widow of the late Wm.Mar
tin. Mrs. Martin was born the22d of Decemu
ber 1759, being in the eighty-fifth year of her
age. She has left no children behind to mourn
her loss, but an adopted son and a large nnm
her of relatives.- The cord that has been cut
by the cold band ofdeath, was one that was
only strong enough to bind. her to the. earth,
and that affection whichglows in the bosom of
those left behind is not extinenished, but seems
to get stronger; and wbile tYey moriiher.ab
sence here, they rejoice to think the-day is not.
far distant, when they will meet her whom they
here so fondly loved; True it is, our loss is her
eternal gain. And as we have to know the
tree by the fruit, so we feel confident that her
departed spirit is now shonting the praises of
God, in that hayen of repose at God's right
hand, when the wicked cease from troubling,
and the.weary are at rest Mrs. Martin was
highly esteemed by all who knew her; her
private life and public walk, was that thai
should ever characterize the children of God.
She was one of those of whom it is said, many
are the afflictions of the tighteous, but the Lord
delivers out of them all. She was- a member
of the Baptist Church of Christ at Dry Creek,.
for the last forty years, except some four -or
five years, at which time she was a member of
the Rocky Creek Church. The last two years
of her life was a trying time-with her. - Soie
three or four months before her death, she was
heard to express some unwillingness to die,
stating, that before that 'time she always felt
willing to go; but having labored under the
afflicting hand of Providence for nearly two
years, became somewhat like Thomas, having
doubts and fears; bnt He, who has said, I will
be with you in six troubles, and not forsake
you In the seventh, was pleased to verify that
piomisein the end, and give her grace to cheer
her sinkinglapiritsmnthe trying hour. and while
her poor body was contending writh the King
