THE SPRING.
The Spring! the Spring! the blihgtsome
Spring!
With shrubs, and flowers. and mock bird's,
note,
That thrills the wood with merry ring,
And jasamine odours wide afloat;
And bursting buds, and springing grass,
That carpets oe'r sweet nature's face,
With emerald hnes that far surpass
The gem that glows with borrow'd grace;
And roses red, and violets blue.
And anemones. rich and rare,
And pinks of soft and varied hue.
And snow drops white, and lillies fair;
And cowslips bending o'er the stream.
And creeping nondescripts, that mount
The forest giant's wide spread limb,
And bell-cups hid besides the fount;
And woodbines twining wild and high,
And scented shrub, and blooming tree,
And rich peonies meet the eye,
And amaranth that's dear to me;
And hyacintb of varied bloom,
And honey-suckle, odonr'd sweet,
And hawthorn flowers, dispelling gloom,
Are widely spread, the sense to meet;
And lark that mounting trills his air,
High in the air of you blue heaven:
And blue bird's chant that's soft and ciear,
1 And whiporwill that hails the even;
And blue jays, diest in heaven's attire,
And nonpareils, of plumage gay.
And red birds, mantled o'er with fire.
And thrush, that meets the morning ray;
And rabin, seeking where to place
His nestling home. from rude boys free;
And doves, a loving, timerous race.
That mourn their mates with constancy ;
And sea side birds, so sweetly sung,
As screaming o'er their nestled brood,
By him whose notes are freely flung
O'er hill, and stream, and swelling flood;
And gales that take the slumbering sense
of nature's children, far and wide,
And breathe a feeling pure, intense,
Toward him who all these goods supplied,
Has enme to swell our grateful tide,*
To Him who rolls the seasons rouind,
Whose bounties are as nature wide
Whose love knows.neither stint nor bound.

Faith opens all its portals wide,
There sorrow's flair is ne'er unfinrl'd,
But Peace, and Truth, and Love abide.
Hope spread her blossoms to the eye.
That's calmly raised to that pure home;
And gathers Flowers that never die,
Anl garners fruits for days to come.
Children their long lost parents grasp,
Ani Parents welcome Children there;
Husbands their Wives in chasteness clasp,
And Wives with Husbands glory share.
There Fathers, Mothers, Brothers meet,
And sisters hail onr blest return;
Friends gather round with cordial greet,
And foes their hate in Love inurn.
The trembhling hand. the longz dim'd eye,

The silent Tongue new accents try.
The deaf'ned ear pure sounds shall tast&
There s'ouls. the tnnseen' hand of fate,
Hath sever'd !ong, and sunder'd wide,

To dwell -in love, in truth abide
There sins! forgiven, and fends forgot,
Th'y children, f'ather! swell thy praise.
With sounds surpassing organs note,
From cheerlul voice, in sweet amaze.
Come quick the year, the day, the honr,
When carth recedes,-bright Heaven's re

They wait thy word All Moving Power,
