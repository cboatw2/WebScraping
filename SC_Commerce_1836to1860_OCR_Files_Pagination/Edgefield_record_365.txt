WASHINGTON, April 12.
The-tariiage-ofChevalier Bodisco, the
Russiand-inister-, which has so long-been
talked of, has at:length taken place. Mr.
Fox, the British Minister, the Belgian
Minister, Mr. -Paulding, Jr., and Senator
Buchanan, acted as groom's men. Mr.
Clay, of Kenttcky,.gave the lady away.
The preparations for this marriage, have,
It is said, beon more costly and elegant.
than for an ohertht ever took place i
this country. The Chevalier is reported
uo be very rich.
April 13.
The subject ofourielations with Great
11ritain is conversed of here and regarded
-with undiminished anxiety. An appre
hension exists, though as I hope --without
foundation, that the report of Cdl. Mudge
-and Mr. Featherstonhaughwill be adverse
to our views of the Boundary, as fixed by
,the treaty of 1783. In this-case, another
arbitration will not probably be agreed to
by Great Britain, and sho wiil make no
counter proposition, but retain possession
of *be territory, increase her military force
there, and *oirair.L her encroachments, till
-she has goaded as into a-war.
'1Mr. Adams, in his remarkson this sub
ject the other day, said lie was at a loss to
rdiagine upon what groundsthe President
felt so secure against the occurrence of a
collision with England, uatil hefound that
it was his intention w prepare another re
ference to a third party. lie then declar
ed that blaine will assent to this, daunted
her with her cool and "Eame". subinission
-assumes that England, from a tempori
siug disposition, will assent to it, because
it will giveber quiet possession for years,
and then concluded that there is no longer
any ground of approhesionof a collision.
This Speec1* wlhch seems to have been
chieflvintended to-provoko-Maine to take
the quarrel into her own hands, and there
by precipitate the country into a war,
overlooks the contingency which is now
she thief ground of apprehension here, to
4vit: an adverse report from the British
- Government will discontinue what Mr.
Adams calls "iheirprecarications here" and
* *ontinue --their encroachments therc." We
9hatl have one advantage over her in this
result, that we can take our own time for
thaking war, and wait, at least, till we are
better prepared for it, in a military and
inancial point of view.
' The Lremendous "defalcation," as they
term it, in the Bank of Virginia- creates
somesensation here. It must shake the
bank and confidence in banks.- The con-.
titance of the present -depression will
gradsdally disclose many other "defalca
tioni," begun and continoed.and concluded,
iimesdfexpansitm and speculation. I
look-upon these perpetually recurring rob
beries as one of the chief circumstances in
that "traia-of developement" which, Mr.
Calhoun *air, is to end in the downfall of
the whole banking system. Letters from
Richmond state the.ascertained amountof

in the Senate. Mr. Buchanan from the
Committee on Foreign Afrairs, reported
the Resolutions heretofore introduced by
Mr. Calhoun, in relation io the rights of
neutral vessels driven by stress of weirtber
into the ports and under the jurisdic
iottn of a friendly power. The resolu.
lillions are reported w'tbout nodilica
tlon, except as regards the phraseology of
the second- -Th first and third are re
ported verbatim. The third resolution
declare that the seizure of the negroes on
board of the Enterprise. in Port Hlamilton,
Bermuda, was in violation of the laws of
. .ations and the rights of Ameiican citizens,
-w hose property they were. I see no room
- ao doubt that the almost unamimous assent
of.theSenate willhbe given to those declara
tions. WVhether they will have the effect to
Awaken the Oovernmient of G. Britain to

ss another question. It is my opinion that
no ministry would hazard their popular
ity by receding from the position which
has been taken on this subject. It is an
injury that must remain unredressed,rank
ling;,'and perhaps be repeated, until it shall
provoke us to war.
The bill to enable claimants of lands,
within the limits of Missouri, Arkansas,
Elississippi and Louisiana, to try the validi
ty of their titles, was discussed and finally
passed to a 3d reading-21 to 11. This
bill invokves immense claims, many accru
ing under .the treaty for the purchase of

The leport of the Committee on For
eign Affairs of the Seate, on the subject
of the North-1fastera Boundary dispute,
was wade yesterday, and taksunin connec
tion with the debate that fatlowed it, it is
well calculated .to throw cold water on the
war forever. The Committee were unan
imous in the report-.they infornm us as to
the condition of the negomiation, and state
their reason for not making a general re
port on the whole 'subject. at the present
moment. They deem it inexpedient, at
this time, to repo'r on the subordinate,
. though important question, in relation to
the temporary occupation of the disputed
territory. A reply to our last proposal,
tpay be expected early in May. and the
question of Peace or War may, in a great
degree, they say, depend on that reply.
In themean time, they recommend an am
jeabie s'pirit, and a prudent course on our

'M-r. Calbeoa's resolutions in relation to
the rights of neutral vessels in foreign ports
were taken up in the Senste. Mr. Clay,
of Ky., expressed anme doubt as to the ex
pressing an opiniion on .merely abstract
propositions, But Mr. Calhoun said it
was ver important to the whole Union,
asnd particularly to that portion of it which
heo had the honor In part to represent, that

The news of the result of the New York
election created much stir in the House.
The democrats chuckle as nuch as the
Whigs did after the C6muectient-election.
They say, and believe that. New York is
as certain to vote for Mr. Van Buren as N.
Hampshire is. I have never had a doubt
of it myself-for stale pride - alone wo'imd
counterbalance the Whig majority of last
fall. Thero was never an instance in
which a Statirefused its vote for one of its
oSvu citizens who was a proniinent candi

of the democratic ticket in New York.
April 18.
The Housebas tiot yet disposed of the
civil and diplomatic Appropriktion Bill.-'
The public service is materially prejudi
cial by iho delay of this and other appro
priation bills; all the speeches now relate
to personal.and party topics.
In the Senate, the subject of the Branch
MiAnts.was discussed. The bill to enable
those' Mints to coin silver change, was 'ta
ken uJp on its passage, and advocated as
necessary, in order to supply the Sotuth
with silver change as*a substitute for shin
plasters.
Mr. Preston said the Mint, at Philadel
phia, was amply adequate to all the coin
age for the Union, and it would be much
cheaper to coin both the gold and the sil
ver there and send it the South.
It was reporied also that the bullion
must he transported to the Sout hern mints,
and that the expense 7of those establish.
ments amounted to more than twenty
per cent on . their whole coinage. Some
Senators, who voted oi iginally against the
establislment of the branches, were wil.
ling to keep them in operation now, as all
the expense of their establishment had been
incurred.
Mr Calhoun admitted that the produe
ion of-gold at the South,to facilitate which,
hese minis were established, had imateri
ally diminished. The labor and capital
enployed init, had been devoted to cotton
growing, and making of the works were
abandoned; -but the business would find its
level again. He was in favor of the bill.
Mr. Preston moved to recommit the bill,
with instructions to inquire into the expe
iency of abolishing the branch mints: this
was lobt, 4 to 28-and the bill was theu
finally passed.
The Senate disposed of many private
bills and will soon clear their calender.
On n 6 _ usenu.s caier irn about 420 iN;
There have ben, in for mier sessions, at
this stage of the session, 1,200 bills.
April 19.
The Senate was in session, yesterday,
ill a late hour, though it was Saturday, a
hay which that body has heretofore taken
or recreation. They were chiefly enga
;ed on private bills, a numtier were pas
sed to a third reading. The bill refunding
the duties on a bill imported for St. Phil
lip's Church, in the city of Charleston,
was passed, after a very animated discus
5ion.
Mr. Preston has not relinquished his
apposition to the utseless expense of the'
'ranch mints, lie submitted a resolution;
,hich was agreed to, directing the Com
ittee on Finance to enquire into the ex
pediency of suspending or discontinuingi
te branch mints on either of them, and'
eport by bill or otherwise.
Joint resolutions of the Legislature of
fewv-York were presented in favour of a
teneral bankrupt lawv. Three or four
States have passed similar resolution.
This subject,has now become involved ith
:otsiderations of a party character, which
have added to the diffictulty of procuring
the passage of any bill on the subject.
The whigs are opposed to a bill embracin~a
banks and other corp)orations; and many of
the administration members will support
no measure that does not apply to them as
to merchants. It is required, indeed, by
Mit. Benton and others, that any batnk, re
fusing to redeem five dollar notes in specie
on demand. shall be subjected to all the
provisions, of compulsory bankruptcy that
apply to individuals, a certain proportion
of their creditors, in nutmber and amount,
may take measures to wind them up.
The policy of this measure is strongly ad
vocatedi. If the whigs will consetnt to it,
there can be no further obstacle to the pas
sage of efficient getneral bankrupt law.
But it is not probable that they will do se.
April21.
The Senate Chamber wvas crowded
yesterdlay, mornling, in consequence of the
intimation from Mr. Clay, that he should
speak in ojpositioni to bills, nowv on their
passage, extending the pre-emption laws,
and for the reductiotn and graduation of
the price ofthe public lands. But, as soon1
as thte journal was read, Mr. Anderson, ol
Tennessee, announced the death of the
venerable Hugh L.. White, his immediate
predecessor, as Senator front the State of
Tennessee, itnformation of which event he
had just received. Mr. Andervotn passed
a warm eulogium on the character and
service of Judge WVhite, and moved the
customary resolutions iu honor of his.

The resolutions were seconded by Mr.
Preston, wvho also paid a briefand eloquent
tribute to the public and private virtues of
lis deceased friend. The resolutions were
unanimously adopted, and in further tes
timnony of the respect of die Senate for the
deceased, they imm tediately adjourned.

SAVANNAH, AprIl 19.
From Flor;da.-Capt. Peai-son, of the
steambout Iris, arrived vesterday morn
ing from Black Creek, fias furnished. us
with the following:
Information reached Black Creek on the
l6th inst., by express from Fort Fanning,
that on the 13th. as an Ombulance was
returning frein Fort Griftin, escorted by a
non-commissioned ollicer and six privates;
(regulars) it was attacked within about 8
miles from Fort Fanning, by a party of'
about 15 Indians. as is said-the four mules
were kiuled, and the Ombitlance burnt.
Froit the teamster's statement, there was
among the Indians, who fired first, a White
man, (stout, well built and athelic) dressed
with pantaloon, calico shir, black vest,
hat and whiskers. As the driver sprung
out of the wngo oin one side, the white
mai entered it on the other, who said, ac
cording to the teamster's report-"Don't
run and we will not hurt you." One of
the escort was badly shot through the body
but lie was taken off by hiscomrades, who
behaved with great courage and determin
ation.
Letters received at Black Creek, 16th
April, from Tampa Bay, dated 9th April,
says-"Two Indians enine there a few
evening's before, at taroo-said they came
from Hospitarki. exhibited while feathers
and other indications, desirotins of being a

whether the commanding olcer secured
and cqonfined these hoitiles;the presumption
is, that he did so. as it was Gen. Taylor's
orders that Pl Indians conitig in. to the
different posts,.should he immedihtely se
cured anud treated as Oirisoners.
Indian troubtes in tme Wcat.--Accounts
friom Fort Leavenworth st'ate that serious
diftficnbies are apprehended between our
border settlers id thai quarter and the fron
lier tribes. In the north-west of Missouri
autrages and depredations have been al
ready committed by the Ottoe Indians on
otir citizens. A squadron of one hundred
mounted dragoons under the command of
Capt. Boone has been despatched from
Fort Leaven'vorth to the scene of distur
bance. The accounts say that the pre
parations for defeince on our frontiers a
long the whole extent as far Sonth as Tex
as are lamentably deficient. At Fort Lea
venwnrth, after the departure of Capt.
Boone's squitulroni, there we'e not forty ef
fective mten left to garrison the works-the
post having been weakened some time
since by the withdrawal of three comnpa
niles ofdrngoons ordered by Gen. Arbuck le
to Fort Gibson.
The unprepared state of our frontiers is
the more alarmidng on accotuat of the ap)
prehetnsions etttertai ned of a combination
among the various3 Indhian tribes, Rn
mnors had reached fort Leavenwvorth of a
union amtong the Sacs, Iowvays and Oc
toes-these tribes~are capable of arming
twelve hundcred wvarriors. They were re
piresentedi as going through the usnal pre
liminaries of a warlike expedition-such
as paintingibemselves,singing war songs.
&c. The depart utre of the three compa
nies from Fort Leavenworth is known to
them, and it is thought that this circum
statnce has tended to hasten the develope
mient of their long intended schemes of hos
tility against the whites. The fends a
mnong the difierent tribes ore regar edl as
mere family quarrels, which are t e re
conciled whenever opcasion is presentedlof
successful warfare against a common etn

A confederation of this kind amotig the

*rO Texas.-The stean packet Co
lumbia, Capt. Windle, arrived yesterday
afternoon bringing Galveston papers of the
8th inst.
No further netvs had been received from
San Antonio. The Houston Morning Star
says: We wait Wilt great impaetience for
another arrival from San Antonin, as it
will probably bring us accounts of the to
suit which followed the dispatch of a mes
senger to the Cumauches, to inform them
of our readiness to exchange prisoners with
them. The majority among us appear to be
igiorant of the great suffrages imposed upon
the.unfortunate woinen and children, who
arein the vilest and most cruel bondage to
these i uthless savages. If the whole truth
concerning their hardships, toils, depriva
tions and misery .could be.known-if an
eye witness or fellow sufferer would come
among us, and draw a picture true to the
lire orthe wretched state in which they are
held, of he lung drawn sighs for freedom
which (lay after day are escaping them in
the midst of their toil and drtdgery, if the
sickness of the heart which is coninually
caused by the long deferred hope of once
again beholding iheface ofkindred, home,
civilization, and happiness, it would stir a
feverin the blood of age,and waken in eve
ry manly heart a determination to free
thetn from their wretchedness.
-It is yet very doubtful what course
those devils incarnate will ptrsue in regard
to their captives, when they are informed
of the blood that has been shed. They
may murder them in revenge, and then
make a dash upon the forces guarding the
prisoners taken at Bexar-they may form
a juncture with a kindred tribe, or they
may have sense and feeling enough to ae
cede to our offers of exchauge-uous ver
rons."
The Tonkewa Indians remain true to
their profession. and have solunteered un
der Col. Burleson to go after the Cuman
ches. The latier lately robbed the Ton
kewas of all their mules and horses, and
killed two of their tribe.
1mnportant Naval Movements.-Orders
have recently been despatched to all the
Naval stations to have every thing put in
readiness for immediate service. The
late movements of the British authorities
respecting the Maine boundary line is the
probable cause.
Commodore Renshaw, of this station,
has received instructions to complete the
steam frigate now on the stocks, with all
possible despatch, and Capt. Al. C. Perry,
late of the Fulton, is to take command of
her. Additional workmen have been em
ployed, and she is now nearly all planked.
The iindependence and Fairfield, just ar
rived front Rio, aind the Relief are to he
kept in commission. The Columbia and
John Admas, shortly expected home from
the East Indies, are also to lie prepared
for sea again immediately.-The ships of
war now on the stocks are to begot ready
for launching, and the two seventy fours
moored off the Navy Yard, to be prepared
at short notice. The crews of those ves
sels just arrived are to be paid off itamedi
aicly so, that they can spend their money
and re-ship agair. None of the officers can
have leave of abseince, but are to hold
themselves in readiness for service.
Such is the nature of the instructions
lately received fromWashington, and such
have been sent to every Navy Yard.
What do they indicate!-N. Y. Herald.
From Jamaica.--By the brig Bridgeton,
York, we have Jamaica papers to the
25th ult.
One of them contains an extract from a
llarbadoes paper (the Barbadian,) which
represents the conduct of the coloreil pop
ulation to be nmuch worse that it was sonme
time since. According to that paper they
refuse to enter into any written contract,
and in many instances have struck work.
As many as thirty estates are represen
ted to be without a laborer. There had
been twvent y fires lately, the greater part of
whicht were supposed to be the work of
incendiaries.
'What with incendiary fires, and threat -
enitngs of maore, a scarcity of provisions
and corn from the late droughts, and the
crop) of sugar expIected from the same cause
not to exceed 10,000 hhds., many reason
abily anticipate a year of unusual distress
to the poor, a severe pressure upon the
middling classes or hou'sekeepers. and ruin
to manay landed proprietors.'

EFrECTs oF NEURO EaActrATron tN
JASIAtca.-Recent Accounts from this Is
land, repmresent it in a most dleplorable con
dlitioni. The Captaitn of a schooner re
cently arrived at Mobile, states that the
emancipated negroes were 'urning and
destroying builditngs int every direction. So
great an influence had this calamity on the
value of property. that the most valuable
estates had becen sold tn some instances, I
for one seventh of the original cost. 1
"Perhaps," says the Cornwall Chronicle
of the 8th uIt, 'ini the history of no nation
is to be fotnnt so complete a depreciation
of properties, as that which has taken place
in thte West luidies since the tabolition of
slavery. Such to be expected after thei
law came into operation, but certainly not
to the degree to whicht it has falletn."
"The praedal laher was attach~ed to the
soil, and the absolte property of the mas

TaURSDAy, APRIL 30, 1840.
We are inaebted ra the Hon. J. C. Cal
boun, for a copy ofthe Letter of the Hon.
Mr. Hubbard, of Ala., to his cocstituents.
We have received from the Hon. Wad
dy Thompson a pamphlet called "an ex
amination of the claims of Mr. Van Buren
and Mr. Harrison to the support of the
South, by W. Thompson, in an address to
his constituents". We will publish it. We
are also indebted to Gen. Thompson, for a
copy of his speech "on the bill to authorize
the issue and reissue or Treasury Notes."
The Bank of Hamburg, S. C. still con
tinues to check on New York, at 3 per ci.
ror its own bills, and at 34 for bills of the
different banks of the State.
We are requested to state that at a meet
ing of the Orlicers of the Second Battal
lion, Tenth Regiment,South Carolina Mi
litia, David Payne, Esq. was nominated
ti Candidate to represent the District of
Edgefleld at the ensuing election, for mem
3ers of the Legislature.
At the commencementof the University
)f Pennsylvania, held 3d inst. the Degree
yf Doctor of Medicine was conferred on
159 young gentlemen. Two of this num
yer, Edward H. Anderson and Thomas
Lake, are of this State.
We commend to the attention of our
District readers, the address of "Arator"
o the planters of Edgefield. We are
highly pleased with this communication.
It comes from a very intelligent gentleman
>f acknowledged practical skill in Agricul
ure, and one who, as we know, has at
heart the best interests of the District.
Ifis sugcstions meet our entire approval.
It will be remembered by some of our
-eaders, that we recommended not long
iince, the formation of an Agricultural So
:iety in Edgefield. We are much grati
ied to see. that one will probably soon be
.-stablished.
The suggestion of the Union of an Ag
-iculural Society with the Pbilosophical
Society, now in operation, is a good one.
Agriculture is a science, and we are pleas
-d that it should receive that attention
which it so eminently merits, from an In
titutiun, calling itself'Philosophical. We
tape, that the planters of Edgefteldi, will
ittend to the suggestion of "Arator," who
-ecommends to them to assemlile at this
place, on sale-day next at twelve o'clock,
ror the purpose of organizing a District
Agricultural Society.
Two papers are now published in Edge
reld District. Thesi are the Hamburg
Four,al, and the Edgefield Advertiser.
rhe fortner, is a neat, semi-weekly, com
mercial paper,professing neutrality in pol
ics. The numbers we have received,have
:otitaiaed besides commercial news, nmuch
niscellany. Our paper is a political one,
mot professing neutrality in politics, but
ree, woe think, from party bitterness. It
s not excn'lusively political. Duriug the
ecess of Congress, it contains something
else besides the speeches and prosing, yap
d essays of politicians. But we are not
lisposed to laud ourselves. Some years
ince, two papers were published and sus
ained for a tjie,in Edgefield. Outrcom
Duaity is 1-ich chiough, and we hope lib
'ral etnough, to support two at the present
ime. We will use our best exertions to
preserve our paper from sinking, and wre
loubt not that our neighbors of the Ham

states, to Lewis Tappan of New York,
ipon declining to present to the Senate,
mn A bolition petition, signed by some we
nen. We are pleasedeiat the manly the'
ourteous rebuke, which Col. Johnson has
;iven to these females. In signing the pe

heir sphere. Their only excuse can he,
hat they were urged to affix their signa
uires to it, by a set of desperate fanatics of

would recommend to them to "go to spin..

We would say to them, " let politics alone."

Robbery on a large scale.-Wm. P.Dab.
ney, first teller in the Bank of Virginia,
recently stole upwards of half a million of
dollars from that bank, and ran away..
He is said to have sustained .an excellent
character previously, and to be highly con
nected. After this, let the Whigs write
no more about Tbe pettit larceny of Sub
Treasurers. All Governmentofficers who
have "an itching palm" for public money,
can learn much in the art of robbery, from
Dabney the bank ieller.
The editor of the "Temperance Advo
cate" is a cheerful soul. He states thathe
has been confined to his post, that islis
bed-post, for a considerable part of the
Wiuter and Spring. Still, he writes with
as much earnestness, and occasional pleas
antry, as if he felt none of the --ills that
flesh is heir to." This is setling a good
example. Editors should never succumb
to the misrortunes belonging to humanity.
They should rise alone the ills which bow
down mere common mortals.

TO THE PLANTERS OF EDGEFIELD.
It will be seen in the advertisement of the
President (if the Philosophical Society ot this
place, that a proposition has been made and
favorably itertained, of utiting an Agricul
tural Society with that institution. The organ
ization of that Society, was effected about the
commencement of the last year, by an associa
tion of gentlemen from the village and its vi
cinity. It soon attracted a good deal ot'notice
by the popular and instructive lectures, and
exhibitions, of a few of its learned and spirited
members, and for several months in the spuing
nod summer, afforded amusement and informa
tion to a large and respectable audience. We
are now given to understand that the Society
have sent to Europe, for euch appnaratu~s, ais
may be requisite to the illustration of those
subjects of science, which of necessity ,must
constitute the principal topics for popular and
practical lectures, and essays. This apparatus
will cost the Society something over two hun
dred dollars, and it is now proposed to connect
with it, an Agricultural Association. as an ap
propriate adjunct and auxiliary, without charg
ing upon the new members, any portion of the
expenses already incurred by the former.
This act of liberality is highly honorable to the
members of the P'hilosophacal Society, and
cannot fail to impress the public mind, with
the most favorable sentiments..
The want of an Agricultural Society in this
District, has been sensibly experienced for tma
ny years, and its formation at the present time
is forced by the highest considerations of in
Serest and.patrioism. At no period in the his
tory of the State, lass this primitiv'eoccupati:.n
of man, required .the zeal, eney and united
efforts of its votaries in a highr de gree, to
ausfaitn it in its languishing condition, than- at
thepresent mowpentragainst tie'presaureofthe
mosto.untoward, .discouragwig circumstances.
Thme institutipn of this Sod~ety, forms a subject
of legp iaterestito manyofonr own planters,
and it is known that our friends in neighboring
Districts, are anticipating itaestablishmsentwith
great solicitude. Agriculture is now being ap
preciated as the paramnountsinterest ofthe State.
he public min has bee awakened to its ims
portantce, and zealous effort, are now being
made-over the State, by individuals and socie
ties, to elevate it to its true position of dignity
and utility.
A Stats Society was formed in Columbia,
during the last session of the Legislature, by
the Delegates to thme Agricultural Convention,
who represented the d iffe'rent sections of the
State, and -embraced a large portion of the in
telligence and patriotism of die country. They
have reommended the formation orb District
Societies, tu actnas affiliated auxiliaries, in the
cause of agricultural improvement-not only
by the collection and dissemination of know
ledge at home, but by sending their delegate.
to attend the annual meeting of the State So
ciety in Columbia. An Agricultural Society is
of vast importance to the planter It collects
and concentrates much useful and. practical
knowledge, and-offers in a condensed form, the
experiments and discoveries of its practical and
scientific members in easy and familiar lan
guage. Hence, a society serves the important
purpose ; first, of aggregating knowledge, and
then of imparting, and diffusmng from its acen
mulated stores, valuable inf'ormatida to an en
tire community. An Agricumltural Society will
bring our planters together, mind will be
brought in contact with mind, each-imparting
its qnota of knowledge, the experiment of one,
the discovery of another, and the scientific re
searches of a third. Mighty monuments have
been createil by each pilgrim to a favorite
shrine bearing wvith him, and depositing bat a
siihgle stoe to the accumulating mass. Great
achievements have been accomplished in reli
gione. politics, and scienee, by the voluntary
contributions of those, who were the zealous
votaries of a creed, or a principle. And shall
the planters of this District he laggards in the
cause of Agricnitu
