Washington, Sept. 20, 1841.
Gentlemen : Doubts have been at.
tempted to be cast upon the correctness
of Mr. Ewing's statement in relation to
the part taken by the President in getting
up the Fiscal Corporation Bill, bv arguing
that there was an impropriety in
making it which ought to deprive it of
credit. There are circumstances in this
case distinguishing it from all others that
1 recollect of the kind. It grows out of a
fnuttor ?\ f nffini.l k.iulnnoj trailkUrtpfl hi*. I i

twecn high public functionaries, and is of
public and general concern. The public and
open conduct of one of these high
functionaries is in direct opposition to .
what the othor had, by his express direc- I'
tion and authority, affirmed hs to his in. 1
tentions and purposes. There can, K i
humhlv submit, bo no serious question in <
such a case upon the point of personal <
propriety, when the injured seeks to vin- 1
dicate his nonor by disclosing t e truth. 1
The obligations arising out of confidential ,
relations, in private or public nfTairs, arc 1
founded in mutual trust. He that disre.
gards his own confidential pledges and j
engagements cannot allege the obligation
of confidence, in the same transaction, 1
auninst the natural riirht of self cefence
r> o
belonging to the injured party. For any
thing that can ever be known to the con- <
trary. it may havo t>?en the object of the , >
original pledge or engagement to sacrifice *1
those who trusted and were misled bv it. |?
For these reasons, I do .not hesitate to J :
furnish, for publication, the accompany- j
ir.g statement, which contains all the i
facts and circumttances within mv 1
knowledge, that occur to me as being '
material, connected with the subject of '
difference. Idothisasannctofjust.ee '
not to Mr. Gwing, who requested it, hut 1
to myself and the Public. 1
I avail mvself of this occasion to say ! ^
that I have, at no time, regarded a dif- ! 1
ference of opinion between the President j *
and myself in relation to a Bank, howev- j t
er im|K)rtunt the subject, as sufficient of t
itself to justify a resignation of the office
which I lately held in the Executive Ad- *
' . . *
ministration of the Government. Nor!
t
was it because the President thought pro- j t
js?r to trifle with or mislead his Cabinet, c
us there is hut too much reason to Indieve ! I
lie intended to do, in the affair of the last}?
Fiscal Bank Bill, that I resigned my i
place. There were other, and some of *
them pre-existing causes, for such a course ! *
which many will regards as sufficient of
themselves; and which could not have <
been overlooked. But it was possible to I
explain or remove them, and therefore J
they were not promptly acted upon.? *
The last act of the President, however, '
was conclusive of the true character of s
all the other occurrences or eireumstan- I
ces which had previously awaken.ed curi- '
osity or excited distrust. <
I shall, at my leisure, state the reasons j I
more at large which impelled me to the j l>
course I have thought proper to adopt, I <|
and at the same time furnish a narrative ?
4tf all the causes, ho far as they ftdi under h
my eliservation, which have resulted in t
the separation of Mr. Tyler from the party n
which brought him into power, and the ?
breaking of the Whig Administration. | ?

JOHN BELL.
Messrs. Gales & Seaton. 1
I called to sec the President on official v
business on the morning (Monday, lfllh [
August) before the first Veto Message *
was sent in. I found him reading the s
M essage to the Secretary of the Treasury. | ?
He did me the honor to read the male- j *
terial passages to me. Upon reading's
tbat part of it which treats of the superior i
importance and va?ue of the business *
done by the late Hank of the United f
States in furnishing exchanges between [
the different States and sections of the i
Union I was so strongly impressed with t
idea that he meant to intimate that he }
would have no objection to a hank which
*&ould tie restricted to dealing in cx- s
cioangcs, that 1 interrupted him in ihe | t
reading, and asked if I was to understand, i
In what he had just read, that he was |
prepared to give his assent to a hank in
the District of Columbia, with offices or
ogencies in the States, having the privilege,
without their assent, to deal in exchanges
between them, and in foreign
bills. He promptly replied that he thought
experience had shown the necessity of
such a power in the Government. I I
could not restrain the immediate expres- '
sioii of uiy gratification upon hearing this i
avowal. 1 said to the President at once, I
.that what I had feared would lead to fatal ;
dissensions among our friends, 1 now re- '
garded as rather fortunate than other- '
wise ; that his veto of the hill then before <
hwii would lead to the adoption of a much |
letter one. I also congratulated him J
upon the happy circumstance of the delay >
which had taken place in sending in lus | ;
Veto Message. The heat and violence I
which eight have been expected if the <
Vet? had heen sen\ in immeciatclv upon I
the passage ??f the bill, would now he I
avoided. Time had l?eer given for cool i
reflection, and as the Message did not ex- \
elude the idea of a bank in some form, no
unpleasant consequences woukl he likely
to follow. He expressed his great surprise
that there should tie so much exciton^eot
upon the subject ; said that he
' had had his mind made up on the hill hefore
him from the first, hut had delayed
his Message thv.t there should lie time for
the excitement to wear off; that nothing
could he more easy than to pass a hill
which would answer ail necessary purposes;
that it could he done in three days.
The next day, having occasion to see the
President again, he requested me to fur.
nish him with such information as the
War Department afforded of the emharrassments
attending the transfer and disbursement
of the public revenue to distant
points on the frontier, in Florida,
&c. He at the same time requested me
to draw up a brief statement of my views
upon the subject, showing the practical
advantages and necessity of such a fiscal
institution as he had thought of proposing
Such information as I could hastily collect
from the heads of the principal dis.
hursing bureaus of the Department I handed
to him on the evening of the same
day, knowing that time was of the utmost
importance in the state ia which the
question then was. He received the
statements I gave him with manifest indifference,
and alarmed me by remarking
that he began to doubt whether he would
give his assent (as I understood him) to
any bank.
The next day (Wednesday, 18th Au.
gust) was the stated time for the weekly
meeting of the Cabinet with the President.
Mr. Webster, Mr. Ewing, and
myself, went at ten o'clock in the morning,
and were in/ormed that the President
was engaged wltii Messrs. Berrien,
Sergeant,and. 1 think, Mr. Dawson, of
(jtorgia. We waited until they retired
and the President made his appearance
ibout three quarters of an hour afterwards.
Mr. Badger come in soon after the President
joined us. Messrs. Crittenden and
(hanger did not attend. The conference
which ensued was a long; one?lasting
o o
Iwo hours at least, according to mv recollection.
I cannot pretend to detail all
that was said; neither can I undertake
o gjve the language employed by the
President upon every point, nor of the
neini>ers of the Cabinet. I can only
state the substance of what was said upon
hose points which most attracted my atcritioii.
The President commeneed bv stating
hat he had been waited upon that morn. Ii
ng by a committee of Members of Con.
jress, who desired to know his views upm
the subject of a hank?such a one as
le could sanction. He had given them
?o satisfaction upon that subject, but had
nforined them that he would first consult
vith his constitutional advisers?his
Cabinet?through whom he thought it
^ O
nost regular that his views should be
rominunicaled. He asked the opinion of (
lis Cabinet upon the correctness of the
ground lie hud taken; remarking at the
mine time, that the habit of expressing \
lis views to Members of Congress upon i
iiihjccts of so much interest subjected
mil to great embarrassment and much
msrepresentation. That question l?eing
lisposed of, the President adverted briefly i
lit without much connexion, to the rention
in which he stood to ihe Bank
|uestion, and his disposition to go as far
s lie could to comply with the wishes of I
lis friends. He spoke of the relation <
hat existed between him and his Cabi- ?
icf, and how necessary it was that he I
liould have their support. Would they I j
land by him? Ho much preferred that ,
he whole subject should he postponed
intil the next session ; but if it was ne- i
essarv to act now, he thought a plan 1 ,
night lie devised which, with their co peration,
might be carried through. He ;
vonderod why the Senate continued to
instpone acting upon his Veto Message, ,
vliieh was yet to l>e disposed of. He
up posed it might he to hold it as a rod (
iver his head ; ?nd had some doubts <
vhether it was proper that he should coniider
further upon the subject until the
Senate had decided what they would do <
vith the bill then before them. Some <
>ne present assured him that the post. 1
tenement of the question pending in the
n the Senate was intended to give time J
or reflection, and to prevent an internterate
debate.
The President then gave the outline of
iuch hank or tisccal institution as he
bought lie could sanction. It was to be
n tlm District of Columbia, to have the
irivilcge of issuing its own own notes,
oceive moneys on deposite, and to deal
n bills of exchange between States and
vtween the United States and foreign
State*. But lie wished to have the opinon
of his Cabinet upon it. His own
roiisislenoy and reputation must be look;d
to. He considered his Cabinet his
friends, who must stand by and defend
whatever he did upon the subject. He
ippealed particularly to Mr. Webster for
Itis opinion upon the point of consistency;
ind whether there was not a clear distinction
between the old Bank of the
United States?a bank of discount and
icposite?and the gne he now thought of
proposing ; and whether the constitutional
question was dot different. He r?ninded
us, that in all his former speeches
ind reports, he had taken the ground
that Congress had no constitutional pow.
ir to charter a hank which the power of
local discount. Mr. Websterpointed out
the distinction between the two plans in a
manner which appeared to he satisfactory
to him. The substance of what he said
was, as I understood him, as follows : He
had a decided preference to a hank upon
the plan then proposed over either of those
which had l>een previously spoken of.?
He reminded the President that he had
expressed his preference for a hank which
should he restricted in its dealings to hills
of exchange, when certain gentlemen
were present several weeks before. He
\
then thought as he did now, that it would
answer all useful purposes. One ground
of this preference was, and it had great
weight with him, that the plan did not
contemplate the consent of the States as,
in any way or at any time, necessary to
its existence or efficiency. He thought
the plan proposed at the commencement
of the session, generally known .as Mr.
E wing's bill, as inccngrous and objectionable
on this ground. His general course
of thinking on such subjects led him to
prefer that, whatever power thb Government
asserted, or was authorized to asseFt
should be exercised independently of
State authority, and of the interference
of the States. He thought there could
be no doubt of the constitutional power
to charter such a bank as was then proposed,
according no the President's own
modes of thinking upon that subject, if
i ?1 r?.1?
iic uuucisimiii uiriii, V/criailliy iiicic
was a clear distinction between such a
bank and the late Bank of the United
Stares. The one now proposed was to
he limited in its operations to such subjects
as were clearly within some of the
general provisions of the Constitution,
or such as were clearly necessary in the
execution of others. The privilege of
issuing its own notes, of dealing in exchanges,
and of receiving moneys on
depositc, all appeared to have immediate
to or connexion with the power given in
the Constitution over commerce between
the States, over the currency, and the necessary
fi?.call operations of the Government
in the collection, wife-keeping, and
disbursement of the public revenue.?
Taese were all subjects of national, and
not local or of State concern. The distinction
between this plan and the late
Bank of the United S'ntcs lay in this:
the privilege enjoyed by the old bank, of
dealing in local paper, or discounting
notes having no circulation, as it nvght
l>e, hut between the different streets or
commercial points of the some city had
no connexion with the trade or commerce
lietween the States and remote sections
of the Union, nor with the transfer of the
public money from one point to another;
and it had, therefore, no necessary connexion
with anv of the great national
c
objects for which the bank was chartered;
not could it be claimed as an incident to
any of the powers given to Congress hy
the Constitution. That privilege, he apprehended,
was conlcrred upon the late
hank from the belief that without it the
stock of the hank could not be made protitable;
and it was therefore considered
as a neccssarrv incident to an institution
whicli was itself hut the offspring of an
incidental power. Experience, bethought
had shown clearly that such a privilege
was no longer important or necessary.?
By confining the discounting privilege of
the promised hank to bills of exchange
liptwonn thu eniintrv n iirt fi.rMitrn StnfpH.
? ? -
and between the several States of the
Union, this objection, will not lie against
it.
The President expressed his regret that
be had not used the words "Iwmk of dig.
roun/and deposite" in his late Message,
so that the distinction he now took might
be clearly inferred from that message,
find he could not then he charged with inconsistency.
Mr. Bndgersaid he thought
nothing would have been gained by the
use of the terms ** bank of discount
tleposite" in his message; and
for, as to the charge of inconsistency, it
might, and probably would, l>e inadc a.
gainsl him for party effect, if he sanction,
ed the hill then proposed bv him, inas.
much as dealing in or buying hills of ex.
change would be discounting, and to that
extent make it a bank ofdiscount.
Whenever all the mnterial points appeared
to he disposed of. and.the members
of the Cabinet present hud expressed their
decided approbation of the plan the Pres.
ident had suggested he said that, after all.
he would not sanction a. bank in the form
just agreed upon, if he supposed that it
would be made the groundwork or basis
a bank with all the powers of the Inte
uiankofthe United Slates, fie never
would give his sanction to the power of
local discount. He feared that, at the
next or succeeding sessions of Congress,
the Whigs would l?e bringing forward amendrnenls
engrafting this power upon
any charter he might now approve ; and
he appealed to his Cabinet to know ifthey
would stand by him, and use their influence
in preventing any such movements
while his Administration lasted. Mr.
Webster and others gave him all proper
assurances upon this point.
The President thought a capital of fif.
teen millions of dollars would be sufficient.
A name, he said, was important. What
should it he ? Fiscal Institute would do.
It was objected to.and the name of Fiscal
n .../. c, A k.. ? n_L:
JjUlin prnicucu ??vg" uiuiiiuci ui iijc v^uijlnet.
He replied that there was a great
deal in a name, and he did not wish the
word hank to appear in the bill.
The President then inquired if he was
understood. He said there must he no
misunderstanding of what he proposed to
do. Addressing liunself to Mr. Ewing,
he asked him if he thought he understood
his views fully. Mr. Ewing. undertook
to recapitulate. He understood the Pres.
ident to have no objection to a bank in
the District of Columbia with otHces of
discount and deposite in the States, with
their assent. The President interrupted
him abruptly, by saying he did not understand
him at all: he was not willing to
sanction any such hank. I understood
his objection to be to the power of local
discount. I supposed Mr. Ewing intended
to say that he understood "the President
had no constitutional objections to
such a bank. Mr. Ewing, however,
without explaining, wen* o 11 to say, that
he now understood the President to have
no objection Ion bank in the District of
Columbia, wi th the power to issue its own
notes, receive moneys on deposite, with
offices or agencies in the Slates having
the privilege, without their assent, of?
dealing in bills of exchange drawn in one I
State or Territory and made payable in
another State or Territory of the Union,
and in bills between the United States
and foreign States or Nations.
The President said he was then understood.
He requested Mr. Webster particularly
to communicate with the gentlemen
who hitd v/aited upon him that morning,
and to let them know the conclusions
to which he had come. He also requested
Mr. Ewing to aid in getting the subject
properly before Congress. He requested
that they would take care not to
commit him by what they said to members
of Congress tc any intention to dictate
to Congress. They might express their
confidence and belief that such a bill as
hnd just been agreed upon would receive
his ^sanction; but it should be as matter of
inference from hislVeto Men sage and bis
general views. He thought he might request
that the measure should be put into j
the hands of some friend of his own upon
whom he could rely. Mr. Sergeant was
named and lie expressed himself satisfied
that he should have charge of it. Healso
expressed a wish to see the bill before
it was presented to the House if it could
be so managed.
I then said, addressing myself to
Messrs. Webster and Ewing, that no time
was to be lost in communicating with
gentlemen of Congress; that there was
danger that Mr. Ewing's bill would be
taken up and reported to the House immediately
after the bill sent back to the
Senate with the President's objections wns
disposed of.
As the members of the Cabinet rose to
depart, or just before, the President requested
Messrs. Webster and Ewing. as
they had turned their attention more particularly
to the subject, to furnish him
with written arguments upon the point>
they had been discussing. He wanted
them to fort ify his own opinion, and to layup
for future reference.

'The surprising effect produced by Dr. Taylors

evidently consumptive, restored to health. Yet

we question the virtue of the above medicine ?
In our next we shall be more explicit; meantime
