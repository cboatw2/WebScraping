- TO HOPE.
ght of-the soul! thine hour once past,
The proudesr brow must bend at last.
:Pale agony-the heart must-wring,
- Deipair must plant the sullen string,
The weary spirit long to part,
And all be but the wreck of heart.
Bright tenant of tie trembling breast,
Give-but my sinking spirit rest.
Tho' friendship flies, or love betrays,
Still on thy light shrill fix my gaze,
1jystar, though clduded and alone,
Until my pilgrimage is done.
" The traveller in the fiery sand
Where Afric spreads her burning strand,
When thunders roar and whirlwinds rise
And Heaven is darkening on his eyes,
Struggles in vain, sinks panting down,
And sees his fate in nature's frown.
But. let him find some crystal stream,
His eyes with sudden-lustre beam,
So, Hope; at the enchanting voice,
- Delicious.dreams the soul rejoice,
The agony of heart is o'er;
It trembles, but it lives once more.
Angel of life! thy vigil keep,
Above my waking and my sleep;
- Still pour upon my fainting eyes
Thebeam. the beauty of thy skies,
And, when my final hour is come,1 -
Sweet spirit! be thy heaven my homo.
THE 1OTHERLESS.
You're weary, recious one! your eyes
Are wandering far and wide ;
Think ye of her, who knew so well
Your tender thoughts to guide!
Who could to Wisdom's sacred lore
Your fixed attention claim!,
Ah ! never from your hearts erase
That blessed mother's name !
'Tis time to say your evening hymn,
My-youngest infant dove!
Come, press thy velvet cleek'to mine, .
And learn thy lay of love;
My sheltering arms can clasp you all.
My poor deserted throng!
Cling, as'you used to cling to her
. Who sings the angel's song.
-Begin, sweet birds ! the accustom'd strain,
Come, warble loud and clear ;
Alas! alas! you're weeping all
You're sobbing in my ear.
Good night! go say the prayer she taught
Beside your little bed
The lips that used to bless you there
Are silent with the dead !
A father's hiand your course may guide
A mid the thorns of life :
*His care protect these shrinking plants,
That dread the storms of'strife ;
* But who upon your infant hearts
.- Shall like that mother write ?
Who touch the stdings that rule the soul ?
- Dear. sinitten flock ! good night ?

always kind-they never turn up their no

better employment. WVhat are flirts and

A Type-Casting machine, invented a
abort time ago, by Mr. David Bruce, of
Now York.?hab been brought to a high
state'of perfection and practical utility by
Mr. 0. R.Van Benthuysen, of Albany.
The Albany Atlas-thus describes it :
This machine, or rather the wheel by
which it is propelled, may be worked by
band ; but any number of them may be
worlied by steam, several of them requir
ing only a ,igilant overseer or superin
tendent and two or three children. Thus, i
four machines, which are-small and com
pact, placed at covenenient distances, in
line, may he kept in full operation by one
person and three children. The extent of. !
the saving of labor, and the value of this
invention, may be judged oT by a compar
ison between its results and the usual mode
of casting. An expert workmen will cast
15 type pet minute with the usual band I
matrix. This machine costs from 50 to 60 t
per minute ; and one person~ superintend
ing, four .of the machines, propelled by
steam, it will produce say 200 per minute.
It is at least a safe estimate to say that
one person and threo children will in this
way do the work of ten men, and turn
out more type per minute.
One of these machines is in use by Mes
srs. Figgins & Co., of London, who have i
ordered others. 'It-has also been adopted
by several type-founders in New York and
other northern cities in the Union.
- NEW YoRK, April 26.
Destruction of the. Botwery Theatre.
The Bowevery Theatre is again in ruins,
a fire having occurred about dusk, last.
night, which spread with such rapidity as
to render it impossible to save anything of
its contents. We have been informed that
it is uninsured, at least in New York, and.
the majority of the stock was owned by
Mr. Hamblin and Mr.. Whitting.. One t
person we learn had a narrow escape,
having attempted to save the wardrobe,
he found his retreat cut off,.and no egress
remained except through a window by
means of an iron rod which supported the
gutter. This rod broke.when he was
within ten feet of the ground, so that the i
injury he received was trifiing.
Two accounts are given of the origin of
the fire, the one'that it was occasioned by
an accident in the gas apparatus, and the
other that it began in the carpenter's shop.
Which of the.two is true we are unable to
say. The crowd collected' to witness the
conflagration was immense, certainly not
less than 25.000 persons, who filled every
avenue and spot which commanded a
view of the building,. of which nothing i
now remains but the blackened columns of 4
the.portio.-Journal of Commerce.
Reform.-The President, we understand,
has issued a circular to the department,.
requiring an exact observance of the laws
in regard to the organization of the oflicers.
the duties and attendance of clerks; and 'o
enforce it, has directed the absentees to be
noted and reported. The general com
plaint of persons visiting Washington ou
business with the departments- of the de
lays and expenses which they. are sub.
jected, has rendered the interposition of the
executive necessary.
The circular also requires a distt ibution
of labor among clerks proportioned to com
pensation allowed, and provides for the
suppression of the injustice (too long tole
rated) of making meritoriouas and faithful
public servants perform the duties of such
as may be found negligent or incompetent.

Diplomatic Expenses.-A Paris corres
pondent writes that the expenses of the
American Minister at Paris-are $70 a day;
his wood bill al-me atnounted to $1,400.
It requlires a large private forttune to meect
the expenses of that offce. We are of
opinion that if several of our Ministers
would live at the European courts wri
less ostentation, they would better repre
sent the republican principles of our Go
vernment, and at the .same time lhe inore
respected in their mission.-Crescent City.
The wvokring of Gold Mines at the
South, says the N. Y. Courier & Enquirer,
is said to be increasing profitably. A let.
ter from Mr. Gibbon, of the Branch Mint,
at Charlottville, T. C., published in Silli
mn's Journal, states that increasintg quan-.
tiies of gold are received at that mint,
from Mines in North and South Carolina
-occasionally, also, from Georgia and
Alabama. Gold bullion, to the value of
27,000 was deposited for coinage during
the last year, exceeding by nearly one huni
dred thousand dollars the deposits of ainy
preceeding yearly period. The sands of
the Catawba river and other streams pass
ing through the gold regions, have lately
been washed with profit. The workmen
reside in shanties on the banks of the river,
by permission of the oners, and the same
spots are worked over successfully, as
fresh deposits of sand, &c., are washed
down.
The following is:,adid to be a new order
of.the Postmaster General. It will be
very convenient for publisbera.
"Money. for newspaper subecriptions,
not exceeding $10 in each case, may be
paid to a Postmaster for the purpose of
being pai:l to the publisher of a newspaper
at any other office. The Postmaster is, in
such case, to give to the person paying the
money, a receipt therefor, and to advise
forthwith the Postmaster who is to pay
said atnount of such deposit. Upon pre
sentation of this reeeipit, the amount is to
be paid over. ,The Postmaster receiving
the amount is to debit himself therewith in
his account of contingent expenses."
Beautiful Enract.-T here is scarcely a
profession in which the sympathies of its-.
professors are more painfully excited than
doat of the medical practitioner. How of
ten is he called to the bed of hopeless sick
ness, and that too, in a family, the miem
bers of which are drawn together by the
cosest bonds *of love r , How painful, to
meet the inquirnog gaze of attached friends
or weeping relatives, directed towards him
in quest of consolation, assurances of safe
ty which, he cannot give. And how mel
ancholy is it to behold the last ray of hope~
which has lingered upon ~the face of affec
tion, give place to that dark cloud of des
