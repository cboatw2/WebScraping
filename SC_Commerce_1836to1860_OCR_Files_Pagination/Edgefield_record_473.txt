Neo Tor'and VirginiL.-We quoted
recently some -pasages from the Itich-.
moond paperd on -the.suzbject of the contro
versy between these two States. The N.
York 3ournn of. Commerce of the 20th
inst. ctiains a long and n% ell written ar
ticle on the some topic. in which thejust
claim of Virginia ounchitig lhe muater in
questiont is ably vindicnted.
The fact that the constitution recognied
slaves as property is a thing so well known
and so decisive of the poin: here at issue
that we are leff to wander bow a contro
versy so protracted could grov out of such
a-case as the one in% dikpute. Tho Jour
naliu the following paragraph, demolish
as the only position that could affoird appa
rent grnud to.iov. Seward and his sup
porters:
&"Itis not denied by Gov. Seward, that
slaves were deemed property when the
eihuse in the Coustit ution was framed, nor
that.tle clause was broad enough ihen . it)
cover~the ofence of steiding one. It is in
sisted'that inastn.ch as they are not: pro
per y now, the clause does uot s.aict.
Ti.wguld steile the printidle t lat aSt lIte
iight at any tiet by itslegislaiion, alter
the effect of the constitutioinal pro Nion.
If it inay withdraw ons spceies of property
from its operation, the principle is the
same when another State attempts toild.
It isa aid rule which accomnatites the
caprices of New Yomk andu withholds the
same privileges rotml Virginia."
. At the time oft lie adoption of the con
stItution slaves were helmi in New York as
well as-in States'fort her Soit h. Becnuise
theacondition of New York is now chanu.ged
in that particular it does not therefore fiii
low that the principles of the Constilution
is chauged. It remains as it was estah
lished and it must be interpreted accord
ing to the spiril. in which it was iranted.
The concluion at which the Journal ar
rives is the plain onei that the men deman
(oed by Virginia shoulh Ie given up; and
it intimates with propriety that if they
should be surretidered. they wontbla. if in
soncent,- be able to est ablish their innocence
but that even if di'ty. the circum-itances

Of the manty proijects and foarms in which the
Urrariani spirit of the age lass miade itself man
fest. that of a propo.'itiont to abolish all law. --
or then collection of debts, appears the least
onasistent. aud thec most injurieous.
When first it wa~ sbrouaght Iotward for con
-ideration, and tuphesld by the Skidanires und

over feor social atid po'itienl disganization,
was regarded rather as ste phantasy of weak
Lad visinary leveers, than as serionus pynpa..

hisasters of thie hat teaw yeanss hnuve made many
