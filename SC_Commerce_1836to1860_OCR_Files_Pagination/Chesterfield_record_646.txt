To the Honorable Mknry Cr.\v, Sena/or
in Congress from the Stale of Kentucky.
Sir: The undersignc I, members of
ibe Senate and Assembly of the. Slate of
New York, have heard with deep concern
that you have resolved to retire on this
lay from the councils of the nation.
From the year l^OG, when you first
mtered the Senate of the United States,
until this time, more than half the -period
iHottccl to human life, yon have with one
r?r two shfut intervals, huen constantly
engaged in the service of your country.
During that long period of our eventful
history, n^ important measures which has
contributed to the prosperity or to the
honor of the nation is recollected which,
if not originated by you, has not, at least,
received your cordial and eloquent support.
The course of your policy has in all
tinrwru n (oninentlv American. In
"" ~ J -ponce
and war, as a Senator, and Ambussudor,
the head of (lie Department of
State, you have secured for your country
abroad the respect of her sister nations,
while at home you have protected our
seamen and our ships, and extended our
commerce, fostered our home industry,
and sustained domestic mangfyclures, and
completed our emancipation from colonial
dependence.
True to your principles, * true to your
friends, and, abort: all, true to your country,
it ha* been your rare felicity to he a
cherished leader among your political
friends, and the foremost champion of
their principles, and at the same time to
enjoy the respect and possess the goner
ous confidence of all your fellow.citizens.
It is not within the compass of our design
to dwell upon the numerous monuments
of your wisdom and your patriotism?they
live in the history of the Re
public. The evidences, too, of your expanded
philanthropy and devotion to human
liberty, are a part of the records of
grateful nations. Rut there is one great
measure which more than any other has
occupied vour care, and to which wc
may be permitted particularly to allude
as demanding in an especial manner the
thanks of your fellow-citizens?we mean
the protection of home industry.
This vital policy was adopted hy you
at the commencement of your political
life in the legislative halls of Kentucky.
Q 1 ?
It was the subject of your first effort, and
constituted your fjrst tripnph on entering
the Senate of flip United Stnt.cs in 1809.
you re-established it after the return of
peace in 1810, and was its successful de
tenderi ) the ^reut debate of y~>'~h
and
At tin period of your life have you
wavered or faltered in the support of this
policy, and your .solemn farewell counsels
have now sanctioned, with the weight of
thirty-five years' experience, the great
measure which your ardent patriotism
embraced at the commencement of your
career. If the protection given has not
been always adequate toji he object, it is he.
muse it has not been such as you proposed
and advocated.
I We owe it to you, sir, to hear our tes!
timony that while on the one hand the
I deficiency in the existing laws on the sub.
Led are attributable to no fault or remiss.
1 ncss on your part, on the other, the imper:
feet degree of protection we have received
! anJ which is in a great measure owinjj j
j (o your early, continued, nnd constnnt
I eflorts, has added many millions to the
wealth and many hundred thousands to
I the population of our country?has strip!
ped war of its greatest dangers and sorest
calamities, by rendering us independent j
of foreign supplies, cither of food or rni- j
ment, or the weapons of our defence, and
has given new charms to pence bv brings
] iTijj the comforts and conveniences of I
life within the enjoyment of all.
It is for these great national services
that wodesite to tender you our thanks. I
We speak in our own names, hut we he.
! lieve we speak the sentiments of (hose
whom in other things wo have (he honor
to represent, when wo acknowledge the
vast debt of gratitude which we owe vou:
- J
when we deel ?re our solemn conviction1
that through your whole political life, yon
! have been governed by the loftiest patri- .
j otims and the most unsullied integrity; j
and when, finally, we assure you that wc J
follow you in your retirement with our j
prayers to Him who has hitherto been the I
guardian of our Republic that health and ;
strength may be prolonged to you for
many ycarsl to witness llie success of the |
great measures you have labored to estab- j

'o cr co c: n I have liaJ in "public aifiirs, an I j

i and instructed hy lessons of experience drawn j
from its history, and the practice of other nations ,
I tha: early led ute to a conclusion in favor of the \
protection of the domestic industry of our nwr. I
country. .My convictions li ve acquired ad.li. |
liouaf strength from every rcfl ction I could give
, the subject, and from both pa t and present
experienco in 111 : United States. Free trade is;
; a beiuliful vision, existing only in the irnngina- )
, tton of philosophers and theorists, and practi. |
! c iliy repudiated l?y all nations. An iudispensa.
bio c uidiliou to the adoption ot it by any one
1 nation is its adoption by all. But, instead of
regulating the r trade according to that theory, j
we everywhere b hold restrictions, burdens, and
prohibition!. ; and those nations which make
tho nearest approximation to it nro in the loast
! prosperous state. During the last nine years,
about one halt of our imports hive been admit cd
free of duty; ad, as to tho other moiety, a de. J
i h; ndmg sc.de of duties has been in progress,
j which is now rapidly bringing thein down. If
limre were any roility in tho boastful promises |
1 ofthc partis-ns of free trade, our country ought
ai mis moment to ue in mo enjoyment ui an
1 enviable prosperity. But directly tlio reverse is
its mdancholy condition. Never wore the products
of agriculture sol ing at more di couraging
| prizes; and the gnat Southern staple of cotton,
which was to have been so highly benefitted by
j a reduction of duties, is now sold at a price le?-s
i than it Ins commanded at any time since the
laet war witli (Jroat Britain.
Nothing can bo more erroneous than to mp!
pote the existence of any real incompatibility
i h.-tweon the interests of agriculture, commerce,
; and manufactures, A conflict between them
: would In just as unnatural and alisund as
i notwi en the members of the limn-iu body. Each
prospers most when all of them flourish. Agri;
culture requires but tittle protection, because its
, i position secures it against much foreign rvompe.
| titiou ; or, nttficr, pr.,trcTrnri to co n nnrco and
manufactures is the b-st form of affording pro1
tection to agriculture.
I Without a diversity in the oconpaiio'.* of

t there can bo no suhj -eta produced for mutual
! domesticoxchauges, ?ud consequently no home

\V? nhall not, I fear, rise from our oiithirrn*seJ
i con.l tion until we produce, within our own
country, more of the supplies necessary to
consumption, and depend less upon foreign
countries. jUntil that object is accomplished, we
' slnll be constant, y oxjewed to an exhausting
I drain of the pr?veiou? metals, ?ij:l to sudden
alternations of deijt*ive prosperity and real
adversity. On) of tho obvious modes nf accomplishing
that object is tho regulation of our
foreign trade by means of a properly adjusted
tariiV, stimulating production at homo and
diminishing importation? Irom nhro.ad. And all
j exp rience lias shown tint, on whatever object
1 our in inufacturing industry lias been successfully

The question is sometimes n^ked, lucw tlic

answer is, that lie is benefitted by obtaining

THE UNDERSTATES AND GREAT

T/rn nrfiiit of sf.arcii.
! Lord Aberdeen's Reply to I he Xotc of Mr.
Stcccnxon.
The underpinned, Ac. has the honor of
addressing to Mr. Everett, Ac. the ohservations
which he feels called upon to
make in answer to the note of Mr. Stevenson,
dated on the 21st of October.
As that communication only, reached
the hands of the undersigned on the day
after the depnrturo of Mr. Stevenson
from London, on his return to America,
and as there has since been no Minister j
or Charge d'A flu ires froin the United
I
States resident in this country, the under- ,
signed has looked with some anxictv for 1
I T"* * 1
the arrival of Mr. Everett, in order that j
ho mi<r!it he enabled to renew his di- I
? f. -- - - ? _ .
piomatic intercourse with an accredited j
representative of the Republic. Had the j
undersigned entertained no other purpose i
than to controvert the arguments of Mr.
Stevrnson, or to fortify his own, in treat- J
ing of the matter which has formed the i
O ,
subject of their correspondence, he would
have experienced little impatience; but, J
as it is hie desire to clear up doubt and to '
remove misapprehension, he feels that he
cannot too early avail himself of the pros- }
ence of Mr. Kvcrett at his post to bring
to his knowledge the true state of the '
questions at issue.
The undersigned agrees with Mr. Stevenson
in the importance of arriving at a !
clear understanding of the matter really !
in d spute. Thin ought to he the first
object in tl) JUitfercnccs of States, as well
as of individuals; and, happily, it is often
th) first step to the reconciliation of the (
parlies. In the present case, this under
standing is doubly essential, because a i
continuance of mistake and error may be ;
productive of the must serious couse- '
quenccs.
!Mr. Stevenson pcrs'Sfs in confending :
that the British Government asscrr a right j
which is equivalent to t he claim of search !
i??g American vessels ,-n time of peace.?
In proof of ibis, Mr. Stevension refers ton ;
passage in n former note of Vi?enunt
n 1 - ?? 1 u: ir !
raitnersion nacir?*???u hj inimcn, :
r ~
which he strongly protests, and the <loc- i
trine contained in which lie says the un- !
dersigned is understood to affirm.
Now, it is not the intention of the j
undersigned to inquire into the precise '
import and force of the expressions of}
Viscount Palmernton. These mi^ht have i
been easily explained to Mr. Stevenson
by their author at the time they were
written; hut the undersigned most request
i that his doctrines upon this subject, and !
those of the Government of which he is '
the organ, may he judged of exclusively
from his own declaration.
The undersigned again renounces, as
he has already clone, in the most explicit
terms, any right on the part of the British
Government to search American vessels
in time of pence. The right of search,
I except when specially conceded by treai
ty, is purely a belligerent right, and can
1 have no existence on the high seas during
peace. The undersigned" apprehends,
however, that tho light of search is not
confined to the verification of the nationI
nitty of the vessel, but also extends to the
; object of the voyage and the nat jre of the
cnrco. The sole purpose of the British ,
i - a ~ j
' cruisers is to ascertain whether the v^s'
scls they meet with arc really American
or not. The right asserted has in truth"
i no resemblance to the right of search ci|
... p
; ther in principle or practice. It is simply
a right to satisfy the party who has a
legitimate interest in knowing the truth
that the vessel is what her colorrlinnounce.
This right we concede as freely
as we exercise. The British cruisers are
not instructed to detain American vessels
under any circumstances whatever. On
the contrary, they arc ordered to abstain
from all interfeiencc with them, be they
! slavers 07 otherwise. But where ronsona.
hie suspicion exists that the American flag
has been abused for the purpose of covering
the vessels of another nation, it would
appear scarcely credible, had it not been
' made manifest by the repeated protestations
of their representative, that the
! Government of the United States, which
1 has stigmatized and abolished the trade
' ? ? - - .1 i* ..
! itselt, snnwa onjeci to mo adoption 01
such means as nrc indispensably necessary
for ascertaining the truth.
The undersigned had contended, in
: his former note, that the legitimate in1
ferencc from the arguments of Mr.
Stevenson would practically extend even
I to the sanction of piracy, when the persons
engaged in it should think fit to
shelter themselves under the flag of the
United Slates. Mr. Stevenson observes
I that this is a misapprehension on the
part of the undersigned ; and he declares
that, in denying the right of interfering
with vessels under the American flag, he.>
intended to limit his objection to vessels
bonaJide American, and not to those he.
longing to nations who might fraudulently
have assumed the flag of the
Untied States. But it appears to the
undersigned that his former statement is
by no means satisfactorily controverted
by the declaration of A\/r. Stevenson.?
How is (his bona fiJe to he proved ? Must J
not Mr. Stevenson either be prepared to I
maintain that the flag alone is sufficient1
evidence of the nationality of the vessel,
which, in the face of his own repeat id
admissions he cannot do, or must he not
confess that the application of his arguments
would really afford protection to;
vvprv lawless and piratical enterprise ! i
v " "" *" " I
'Che undermined has also expressed
his belief that the practice was general
of ascertaining by visit, the real character
of ?nv vessel on the high sea? against (
which there should exist any reasonable,
ground of suspicion. iMr. Stevenson
dcn.es this; and he asks what other nation
than Great Britain has ever asserted
or attempted to exercise such a right ? j
In answer to this question, the under-;
signed can at once refer to the avowed
and constant practice of the United
States, whose cruisers, especially in the
Gulf of Mexico, by the admission of their \
public journals, are notoriously in the :
habit of examining all suspicious vessels,
whether sailing under the English flag!
~ o n |
or any other, in whoso eyes are these
vessels suspicious? Doubtless in those
of the commanders of the American
cruisers. B..t, in truth, this right is quite
as important to the United States as to i
Great Britain ; nor is it easy to conceive !
how the rnaratime intercourse of mankind
could be safely carried on without such a
chock.
It can scarcely be necessary to remind !
Mr. Everett, that the right thus claimed |
by Great Britain is not exercised for any '
selfish purpose. It is asserted in the in-j
tcrest of humanity, and in mitigation of,
the sufferings of our fellow-men. The!
o F
object has met with the concurrence of.
tlic whole civilised world, including the
United StattSvof America, and it ought;
to receive universal assistance and sup-j
port.
The undersigned cannot abstain liore
from referring to the conduct of an lion- ,
. i
orahlc and zealous officer, commanding
the naval force of the United States on
the coast of Africa, who, relying on the;
sincere desi e of his Government f<?r the
supprcsiou of the.slave trade, and sensible ;
of the abuse of the American Hag, en. {
tared intoitn engagement on the 11th of
March, IS 1.1, with the officers in comniand
of her Majesty's cruisers on the
same station, by which they mutually requested
each other, and agreed to do.
tain ail vessels under Am rican colors'
employed in the traffic. If found to be
American property, such vessels were to
be delivered over to the commander of
any American cruiser on the station ; or,
ifheionging toother nations, they wore
to be dealt with according to the treaties'
contracted by her Majesty with the re. '
spectivc States. The undersigned he.j
lieves, and, indeed, after the statements
of Mr. Stevenson, he regrets to be uuanle
'
to doubt, that the conduct of (his gallant
officer, however natural and laudable in
its objects, has been disavowed by bis
Government.
It is not the intention of the undersigned,
at present, to advocate the justice and]
. -i ?. ? i ?r .u :
nave reason to believe, that, although bcarm/
the American fl ig, the vessel does not lielong
to the United JStates, he isordeicd, iftheataiej
of the wind and weather shall admit of it, to
go ahead oJ the suspected vessel, after con)
propriety 01 uie rouuru ngui m .vr-jivii, .?->
conceded and regulated by treaty; or to
weigh the reasons on account of which
this proposal has hcen rejected by the J
Government of tne United S ates, lie
took occasion in a former note to observe
tliat concessions, sanctioned by Great
Britain and France, were not likely to he I
incompatible with the dignity and inde-j
pendencc ofauy other State which should j
lie disposed to follow their example. But
the undersigned begs now "to in for-u .Mr.
O O
Fverctt that he has this day corudu.led a
joint treaty with France, Austria, Russia,
and Prussia, hv which the mutual right 1
r .
of search, within certain latitudes, is Fully
and effectually established forever. 'Phis
is, in truth, a holy alliance, in which the
undersigned would have rejoiced to sec
the United States assume their projvr
place among the great Powers of Chris, j
tendom, foremost in power, wealth, and 1
civilization, and connected together in
the cause of mercy and justice. "
It is undoubtedly true that this right
may he ahusod, like every other which
is delegated tojua?y*ruI Jiffjrent hands.
It _is ^o-nhble that it may he exercised
wantonly and vexntiously; and should
this he the case; it would not o ily call
tor remonstrance, but would justify re- 1
sr.ntmcnt. This, luiwcver, is in the 1
- - - ...
highp** rtegreo impronmuc, aim w, m
spite of the utmost caution, an error should
be committed, and any American vessel
should suffer loss or injury, it would be
followed by prompt and ample reparation.
The undersigned begs to repeat that,
with American vessels, whatever Ikj their
destination, British cruisers have no pre.
tensiorrin any manner to interfere. S ich
vessels must be permitted, if engaged in
it, to enjoy h monopoly of this unho'y t
trade: but the British Government will
i
never endure that a fraudulent use of
the American flag shall extend the ini-!
quity to other nations hy whom it is ah. ,
horred, and who have entered into solemn
treaties with this country for its
suppression.
I n cder to prove to Mr. Everett the anxiety
of Her Majesty's Government to prevent any'
reasonab'e ground of complaint, the under,
signed believes that he cannot do better than
to communicate to him the substance of those
instruc ions under which the Brittsn cruisers
act in relation to American vessels when
emp'oyed on this service.
If, from the intelligence which the officer'
commanding Her Majesty's cruder may have
received, or from the manoeuvres of the v
se\ or from o'her sufficient cause, lie shall;
municating his intention by hailing, anil to ^
drop a boat on hoard of her to ascertain her
nationality, without detaining her if she shall
prove to be really an American vowel. But,
should this mode of visiting the vessel bo tm.practicable,
he is to p-quire hor lobe brought
to for this purpose. The officer who hoards
the vessel is merely to satisfy himself of her
nationality, by her papers or other proofs, and,
should she rca'Jy be an American vessel, he
will immediately rjuit her, offering, with the
consent of her cooimahder, to note on her pa
pers tlie cause oi suspecting ner nationality,
and ti?c number of minutes she was detained
(i'detained at all) for the obj?>ct in question.
All the particulars are to he immediately entered
on the log-book of the cruiser, and a
full statement of them >g to he sent by the first
opportunity direct to England.
These are the precautions taken by H*r
Majesty's Government against the occurrence
of abuse in the performance of this service ;
and they are ready to adopt any others which
they may think more effectual for the pti/pos**,
and which shall, ar the same iime, be consis.
tent'with the attainment of the main object
in view.
Mr. Srevenlhn hn said that he had no wish
to exempt the fraudulent use of the American
flig from detection ; and this being the case,
ti e umlereig' cd is unwilling to believe that 4
Government like that of the United Slates,
pr-ifesHng the same object, and animated bv
the same motives as Great Britain, should
seriously oppose themselves to every possible
mode by which their own desire could be really
accomplished.

Correspondence n/ United State* Gazette.
VVashinotoN, April 14. 1842.
The dull monotony of the House ha*
been broken to-day by a kind of episode
?a speech from .1/r. Adams, on the sub.
i /?* # ai /uif p/J'ihano it/1 f h ( ) ro:i t Rritniu.
Ho never rises to speak on any subject
without attracting attention; but on such
a subject as this, all were eager to hear,
and members crowded around him, thai
they might not lose a word he should utter.
1 stated last night that Mr. Wise re.
plied yitfterdav, to Mr. Linn of N. Y. and
Mr. Slade of Vt. His was emphatically
a war speech arid standing in the relation
to Mr. Tyler and the cabinet that he docs,
it was considered indicative of the feel,
ing at the other end of the avenue, or of
a wish existing in that quarter tostir up a
war spirit among the people. To-day
Mr. Charles J. Ingursoll came out with
what Mr. Adams wittily hut aptly termed
"pacific war .speech." The re were five
points of difference between us and Eng.
land, namely: the N. K. Boundary Que*,
lion, the Bight of Search, the Carolina
affair, the Creole case, and the Oregon
Boundary Question. On all these England
was in the wrong: he thought them
was no need of any war?-that tiierp
wou'd n ? be war?he wished w?dj to
Lord Ashbnrlon, would he glad to sno
him settle matters here and go home and
he promoted to an Earldom, hut headvised
lino to yield everything that we claim,

pared and all that, he said it had nlwnva
been the case that the nation worst pre*
pared for war w is in the end victorious
The Knttsh might burn New York, hut
then it was as easy lor us to hurn London
as fortkens to hurn New York. A* to
the ri?^ht of search, he decjared there
was 00 such thing iu war or peace,
Mr. A da nas replied chiefly to this speech
h.it incidentally also to Mr. Wise's, Mr,
V> had not spoken two minute* before
Mr. I explained, and denied whai he hnd
said, and some altercation took place ns ^
to what he had said, to the course of which,
Mr. { got very angry and used the word
senile as distinguishing Mr. Adams' remarks.?Mr.
A. thus taunted with being
an old man, replied with beeorinng digtwtv.
hut with a keennea that pierced the
very 'joints of Mr, t. itiuj made him
writi.*:. Mr. A. then went on, only oecas,
ion illy interrupted by Mr. I., whom ha
fairly tortured by th? scouring irony, m#>
casrn.s and ridicule, which he poured upon
htm! He noticed and ridiculed the idea
that the nation that goes into a war tin*
prepared is sure to come out victorious,
He said that Mr I had spoken with cold
indifference of the burning of New York,
which ho seemed to admit would be ft

quite reconciled to (hie event by the
supposition that if New York was burned,
we otilcl burn London, a city four or five
time* as large, jind there by settle theac,.
count with a large balance in our favor
Sir, said Mr A if there was a man in this
House who heard the gentleman from Pa.,
speaking of burning cities, in the manner
ho did. without a feeling of indignation
and shame, lie wanted no intercourse with
him. Mr A dilated upon this burning of
cities, till he had kindled a tire on Mr
Ingersolls head, which if not as icy as
J/ont Blanc, must have felt a burning
sensation.
Mr A said iio attributed some importance
to tho remarks of the gentleman
from Pa, in connection with the speech
from the gentluinan from Va., Mr Wise;
but he hoped Lord Ashhurton would not;
ho hoped he would consider them made
for a little display in this (louse, for
home consumption?for 44 iiankum, and
that he would not go home, in consequence
of them, but go on with his ne- ^
gocictions with this government, just
as if this speech had never been made.
This ironj was a dagger that went to the
soul of Mr. I., and made him change color
frequently, though, to do him justice, ho
joined in the hearty laugh new and fre
qucnlly, raised by Mr A at ma expense.
In the course of bis remarks, Mr. A.
gave a very interesting history of the
negotiation between this Government
and Great Britain, in regard to a mutual j
concession of search, which took place
