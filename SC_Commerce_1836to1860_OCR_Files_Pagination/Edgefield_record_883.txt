ANNFXATION OF TEXAS.
WAssirsoTos. Jan. 25, 1845.
IHouse.-Ater an explanation by Mr
Adams relative t6 his remarks of yester.
day-a.
Mr Saunders inoved that the House re
solve itself into Committee of the Whole
for the purpose of resuming the Texas de
bard.
Mir. Stevens, of Gn., being entitled to
the floor, arose and delivered an animated
and able speech. He was in favor of
annexation, and would go for the hill in
troduced by Mr. Brown, of Tennessee,
which does not assune the Texas debt.
and which settles the question of slavery.
He would not, however, as other gen
tlemen said they would do, go for any
measure of annexation, if he thought the
sole object of the measure was to extend'
slavery, and *9ould have that effect, he
would go against it. It would not, how
ever, make one more slave than were
existing now ; so that by adlmituiog Texas;
there is no extention of slavery.
Some further debate by several members
took place. when.
As the hour of 2 o'clock approached. the
members began to come in, and when the
discussion ceased, there was a filler
H1ouse than has been present at any time
heretofore d.uring the session. The galle
ries were also crowded to excess. and so
full was the one appropriated to the ladies,
that many of them were forced to take
lodgment among the gentlemen.
At 2 o'clock the Committee proceeded
to vote upon the proposition subtmitted by
Air. Owen, of Indiana, and accepted by
Mr. Douglass, of Illindis. as a modifica
-tion of his own. It does not assume the
Texas debt, and directs that there be
formed forthwith one Slave State,.the
balance of the Territory to be divided
hereafter into thrce or more States, in*
Which slavery shall exists or not, as the
people there may deterini-e.
The vote stood-Ayes 96. Nays 107.
The proposition of Mr. Weller, of Ohio,
k-as then up, which erects Texas into a
.State without anything being said about
slavery, and this grvernmeut to assume
the Texas debt tothe amount of 810,000,
000.
15everal amendments were ofiered and
iejected.
The amendment of Mr. lilton Drown,
of Tenessee- was then read, wbich pro.
vides 'forone s1atve State, and four others
to be erected hereater, in which it shall
exist or not, south or the Alissouri cort.
promise line, as the pe6ple in each of them
May determine. The Texas debt not to
be assumed, but to be paid out of the pro
ceeds of the publte lands.
A t the suggestino of Mr. Douglass, of Il
linois. Air. Drown mtoditied his proposi
tion. so as to exclude slavery north of .the
Aiissouri Compromise Line.
The atmendment was adopted.-Yeas
Jo9, Nays 99.
The original proposition as amended
-was ihen adopted.-Yyes 110, N;ty 08.
Chairman reported Mr. brown's proposi.
tion to the House.
Mr. Uave Johrson, of Tenn.. moved
the previoius'questibn, and he hoped no
further debate would take place, and .that
the 190u'se wottld put ad. end alionce to
the distracting question.
The vote on seco.neintg the previous
questiotn stood ayes 107. nays 07.
So there was a seconitd.
The Speaker then put the question:
"Shall the maitt questittt he ntow put."
Mlr. Biritnkerhof, of Ohio demanded the
yeas atnd nays, which were ordercd, antd
stood; ayes 113; nay< 108.
So it was tdeterminted that. -the main
-queetion should be out. It was on cotn
curretnce itn the amentdmtent ndopted by
the Comtmittee of~ the Whtole, bteintg the
proposition submitted by Mr. Milton, of
Tennessee, to annex Texas.
On mtotion of Mlr. Vinton; of Ohio, the
yeas and bays were otdered, and the
amentdment was decided in the afimhative
-ayes 118, nays 101.
The vote was thent taketn by yeas and

The schooner Sarah Ann, at - New Orleans,
- n Sunday frott Tanmpico, brought diates thence
or the 14th, with the intelligence that a destruc

captured. *Frotm ant extra of the Picayotne, we
get the following sumaary of the principal
.events-prvio~usly to the battle :
To make the narrative more intelligible, we
go back to the 1st instant,-when Santa Anita I

this spirit, atid to enable those itnclitned to de

.Bravei sallied forth from the capitol on the 1st at
the head of 3000 picked men to harraus the ty

TAMrIco, Jan. 14th, 1845.
P. S. Dates from Mexico to the 9th arrived
ast night by express. A desperate battle had
aken place on the plains of Apan, lietween
Santa Annit on one side and Bravo and Parades
in the other. who was captured while attempt
ng io escnpe-500 are reported to be killed.
Gen. Paredes had been despatched by Bravo
in pursit after routed troops. while Braio him
self was on his march back to Mexico with his
august prisoner. This is all I have time to
wt ite you. -T-. T
The news ofthi battle (says the Picayuane,)
is somewhat doubtfd; at any rate there must
the some error in the date. Capt. Davidson
says that he sailed from Tampico on the morn
ing of the 13th, and made 195 miles thatday by
be log. He further states that the ThatbAme
in from Mexico on Sunday the 12th and the la
test news it brought from Mexico on thb 4th.
He likewise spoke with his consignee the morn
ing he sailed. who assured him there was no
later news in, town, The letter announcing
the battle says news to the 9th had beeh recei
ved by express from Mexico. Capt. Davidson
himself puts no confidence in this. We have
no means ourselves of forming any opinion on
the subject.
The Ne*.Orleans Picayune mentions
a rumor in that city that Santa Anna had
arrived in Natchitoches, in Louisiana, and
thrown himself on the protection of the au
thorities. It does not believe the report.

Correspondence of the Mobile Register.
TUSCALOOSA, Jan. 7.
Mr. Phillips, from the committee on
federal relations to whom sundry matters
of national concern had been referred,'
made a learned report which is too long to
be incorporated in this letter. I send you
the resolutions which accompanied the
report, and which were unanimously
adopted. as was also the report:
Be it resolved by the Senate and House
ol Representatives of the State of Alaba
ma in General Assembly convened, They
they regard the proposition of Missacho
setts to amend the constitution, and her
constitution, and her declaration that this
was necessary to the stability and perma
neuce ofuahe Union, as a determination that
she is both reaAy and willing to dissolve
our political conpact.
That .the federal constitution resulted
from a compact between the several States
and is founded in compromise - r
'Thai the question o vepresentaltin *as
adjusted by the conventioti upon equitable
principles, and that Alabama will neither
relinquish this right on the request of one
State, nor at the bidding of any greater
number. [The right here referred to is
the representation of three-ffJY of slaves
und free persons of color, as granted to the
slai'e holditig States by the Constitutioni.]
Resolveil, That the repeal of the 25 rule
by the present congress, w as a weak and
truculent submission to thbe spirit of fanat
icismi. That it adds another atid impor
tant triumph to the faction which, now for
feited in the walls of legislation, may
dspatch its fiery arrows over every ecc
'ion of our conifederamcy.
That we sympathise with the patriotic
tpiirit of the legislature of Sooth Caiolina,
which so promptly re.sisted the insolent mit
empt to disturh her domestic trantjuility.
-The power of slavery belongs to the
St ates respectively; it is local in its char
icier and effects." Each State has a right
o guard its citizens against its inconven
ences anil danger s. "The right to exer
ise her p.ver by a State is higher anid<
eeper- than the toitstitution" "The evil
nmvolves the prosperity and may endanger I
he eristence of a State. Its powver to
;urd against, oi- remedy the evil rests up
in the laws oif self preservation-a lawc
rigil to every community, and espiecially I
o a sovereign Sta'e.

received no letters or papers, but from a
gentleman who came passenger on the

issued a proclamalion annulling the recog
nition of Gen. Duf Green as American
Consul at. Galveston. The President. we
understand, states, that the honor and in
terests of the nation imperatively deman
ded such a course.
. The cause of the flare up between Pres

Further Items.-Since our last, more of
our private correspondence has reached us,
and we have had time to run over all ex
change . We d6 not find howiVer, -in ei
ther, much 'to id'y ieforetfie reader. It is
quite certain that down t'o tle 28th of lie
cethber no. action had taken place; that the
leadt-s. of the GoveI'hment .were using
every effortjit pirent a final recourse to
a contflict of dims; that Santa Anna main
tained as bold a front as if he were at the
libad o'a lirge and well appointid.army.
In the city of Vera Cruz, from which we
have mast copious intelligence,-the dpinion
is unanimous that the downiall of Santa
Anna is beyond questiod; but by the citi

Gen. Bravo entered the capital on the

WASHINGTONS , Jan. 19.
It is stated, this~ evening, that despat
ches have been this day received from
Mexico, which shew that Santa Anna.
though overnowered. is not yet entirely
demolished; though hard pressed, he is
still able to keep his etnemies at bay.
The feeling of moderation towards Mex
ico which has been so strong here, seems
to be giving place to a disposition to press
our negotiatious with her to an isiue. I
learn that it is contettiplated to pass an
act autlhoriving the President to appoint a
commission to examine the claims of our
citizens upon Mexico, and make amends
nccordingly to the claimants, aid, if the
Mexican Governincnt do not assent to the
Treaty which is now before it, by-the 1st
of July next,to make a peremptory demand
on Mexico f'or the payment.
The assent of Mexico to the Annexation
f Texas is no longer insisted upon here,
even by Mr. Benton. It is uederstood
that Mr. Benton is exceedingly anxious
that the project of Annexation should, in
some form, ie consunated at this session.
It is now distinctly understood here that
the Oregon tegotiatioti has utterly failed
in its object, and that we cn tnake no
terms with. Great Britain in regard fo the
matter. Congress as soon as this result
shall be officially made kuown, will pass
a bill for the occu'pation of the teraitory,
and the protection of our citizens there.

little of the proper business of the session

The iouse took up the annexation
<tnestion in Oommiee of the Whole, and
W.' Hatiraett, of Mississtppi, mate a
very effective argument in favor of the
.Measure, confining himself chiefly. to the
.constitutional question.
In the Senate, Mr. Benton presented
the ginstructions from the Legislature of.
Missouri relative to the annexation of
Texas. Air. Beutot remarked upon the
liroad and national views -taken by the
Missouri General Assembly, and upon the
liberal spirit in which they were framed.
If, he said, the measure should be prosecu
ted in the aame spirit of cornprmnise and
conciliation in which the resoluton were
conceived, it would doubtless be consutn
mated.
Mr. Atchinson, the colleague of Mr.
Beriton, seconded these views, and se
tmarked particularly dpon the sixth resolu
tion, to which he gave his asent, as a
liberal tender of conciliation to tle hon
slaveholding States. He anti the Legisla
ture also would prefer that tle people of
Texas should themselves determine wYhe
ther they should have slavery or exclude
it, out tlicy would yiell the point fur the
sake of comnpromise.
The question is. however, whether

The Recent Mviurer- Arrest of McCurry.-1.
We annouinced yesterday in our regular
edition the arrest of Henry M1cCurry, the
supposed murderer of ihe late Mr. Paul.
Roux, who felt a victim, as is justly sup
posed, to his blood stained hands on Sun- I
day night or Monday morning last, at the
tavern of air Nolan, in S Charles street;
opposite the depot. MeCurry, as we
have mtated, was arrested in the city ofr
No%% York. by Mr. A. G. Ridgely. of the
police firm 'of Hays, Zell, Ridgely and
Cook, of Mercer street Baltimore.
There is, it would seem, a Providence
that so overrules events and shapei the
ends of justice, ihiat "murder will out,"
and the polltied perpetrator of it be soo
ner or later overtaken by ajust retributioan.
Officer Riatgely left this city, io pursuit
of the accused at 8 o'clock on Tuesday
evening. 24 hours behind McCurry. He
proceeded direct to Philadelphia, and
thence to New York, where Thursday
morning, about haif past 10 o'clock, assis
ted hy officer McGraih; the supposed mur
lerer was discovered, almost miraculously.
arrested and placed in prison. If Air.
Ridgely had been les vigilant, in all hu
man probability. the accused might have
etcaped. at least for the present. as he had
iaken passage on board the shi It Yorkshire,
and weuld have set sail for Liverpool in
less than two hours. Whilst McCurry
was taking a parting drink with some of
his friends. near the steamboat landing and

Fo'tr a few days pas we have been in

hu:-On the 6th inat., Mr. Sitmeott Bate
itan, about 74 years of age, and a worthy
ilantetr of Texas. Mr. Matthew Jett and
Sman named J, Shtultz, were travelling
'rom Gotnzales rounty by land to Galves
Ont. A tight they arrived withitn a mile

netly wh-ere- they were, as it is supposed,

ins tt pistol at thec head of each, shot them ,
oth at once. Besiees the wound in the
ead of Jett, Itis throat was also cur from

fer beinig shot; his [teadh and face show

lompaniy with Bateman and Jett on the
Gtb inst,, one or the persons present wfen
ihehodies were recognized having met the
priv on that day about twenty miles front
irg'inl, P-4in1.7
Mr. Bateman, as is stated above, wasias
planter of respectability, and possessed of
some wealth. It is kno'en that he had
some S6000 upon his person on, leaiting
home, and was on-his way to the city-lb
purchase slaves. Mr. Jett was a yonnx.,
man of exemplary character. aoout .28
years of' age; was a soldier in :h6haUle.of
San Jacinto, since which tinte he had
lived on the frontier ; was a member-ef
Capt. liny's Spy Company, and a gooW.
one. He is supposed to have had about
him when murdered from 3500 to $1000.
Shtliz was overseer for Mr. Bateman,
and had been in the cou6try but littre over
a year. He has a father at Columbus,
Miss.. ou- (he Bigbee river. Mr. Killen,
who recognized ,the two murdered men,
also knows Shultz, and saw him in Gal
veston ihe day after the murders: hu,t he
then knrew nothing of the affair.. He saw
Shultz leaie on board of the steamship
New York for this city pn the saime day.
These facts beidg public, the - citizens
of Galve-ston, with praiseworthy prompit.
tude. chartered a vessel for this-port, and'
employed Mr. J, W. Moore, Mir. Killen.
and Mr. J. H. W. Chapman, she iltj Mar
shal of.Galveston. to come on in purbult ofS
Shultz. The party arrived here oi Ttei'
day, and soon ascertained that Shultz had
gone to Mobile, wehre he arrived last
Sunday. Killen and Chapman liave gone
to Alabama in pursuit, and Moore has
gone up the 51ississippi, to visit a son .of
Bateman. aq;d to intercept Shultz, shoula
the other party not secure him. WeAhink
the chancei are that the inhuman wretch
will soon be overtaken, and stncerely do..
we hope he may.
Shuliz i% described as abont 28 years of
lige, 5 feet 7 inches high. weighs about 130
ir 140 pounds; is sleudei, has sharp ea
lures, dark hair, grey eyes, and badi'o
whiskers when he left Galveston; has a
rjuick walfk and a feminine voice. . Ho
purchased in Galveston a blaek paletot coat
heavilv braided. with velvet collar and
facings; it had n6 buitons behind,'but was
gtiiehed across the bak.
The sor of Batemnin, mentioned above,
is said to 6e a gentionan of wealth,and
ivill no doubt give a liberal reward thr the
apprehension of the murt'leier of his fathet.
I6 addition to this, there-will certainij
be a rei-aid o'fiered by the government for
the arrei ofShuntz.
It is evident that- robbery was the only
motive for the murder of the unfbrtunate
men. Not a cent was round upon their'
persn, and Shultz itell knew that both
had money.
