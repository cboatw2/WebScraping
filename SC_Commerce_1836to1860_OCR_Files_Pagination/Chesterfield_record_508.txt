From the American Farmer.
CorroN Culturkin India.
It Is stated as a statistical fact to b<
refie.t, on that in Great Britain, there an
three millions of people who owe thei
mctns of support to labor bestowed ii
so no form, on cotton produced in th
Unied States,?Seeing this it is nrg e
thau any great irregularity or failu e ii
lh:> price or supply, could not fail to p o
duce ser ous agitation if not convu'si >'
in that island:?and hence is infenei
the constant anxiety on the part of t <a
Government, to put an end, as far a
p .ssible, to all dependence for the rav
material on the productive capacities o
any people not under its dominion. Na
tural as may appear such a desire, to givi
possible encouragement by the (iov
ernment, to every measure calculated t<

liie conclusion of the treaty between L r<
Palmerston and Gen. Hamilton, recognis
mg the independence of Texas, withou
any reservation against slavery, in s
country so extensive, so fertile, and s
well adapted to the growth of cotton
would seem to contradict the idea of an;
such fixed and long sighted policy; as i
seems also to be at war wi'h her owi
measures for the extinclion of slavery ii
the British West Indies. For ourselve
we are nothing loath to believe, that th
\oung Republic on our borders owes inucl
in that, as in other important foreign ne
goliations, to the superior vigila ice and sa

stances, and highly auspicious for the for
tunes of the country he rcprcsen's as wcl
as, wo hope, his own. But that as it may
it behoves us to look the qjes i<?n full ii
the face. It is not by blinking it that w
can understand the real state of the casr
or be the better prepared either to aver
or to submit to its results. From a sourc
professedly hostile to the existence o
slave labor, and. doubtless anxious to se<
its prophecies realised in its own dav
we extract some statements with the be
ductions of the wrirer, which invite tlx
attention as well of the practical plante
as of the political inquirer. Fas esf a!

" Waif known cotton statistics go t<
show, iabjdhe total amount of the cottor
-export from this country 10 oruuin u
1840, was 1,245,000 bags, of which 343.
642 were from the Atlantic States. The
cotton imported into Britain the same
year, from India, amounted to 216,495?
about one-half the export from the Atlan
tic States. In 1834, it was only 88.122
so that during the last seven years, it has
increased 128,373, or at the rate of 14?
per cer . In 1834, the export from th<
Uni d States to England, was 731,235
and its increase during the last sever
years has be< n 5136,492. at the rate o
70 p r cent. So that, Indian cotto ? ii
tl o British market (says the Phi anthro ?
ht) has gained considerable on mat oi
Am rica."
The British possessions in the Eas>
Indies embrace a territory nearly as ex
tensive as Europe, with a popuhr on n

exceed the crop of the United States.
in answer to the supposition, that thi
quality of the cotton of India forhj s t <
f ar that she can supply the wants of hi
British manufacturer, even if the quantity
could be produced ; the writer be!'or ui
relies on the auth oritv o various travel
Jers, to whose testimony it would be worst
than foolish for the political economic
and statesman, not to say the providen
planter, to shut his eyes,?Some of thesi
follow:
Major General Briggs, who spen
thirty two years in India, explored almos
every part of it, and administered thi
affairs of government, in several provinces
says?"
aWith respect to the means India pos
8esscs for growing cotton, it is necessan
to consider the extent of the country, thi
nature of the soil, its vast population, thi
.description of their clothing, and the pur
poses to which cotton is applied, befon
we can have any concept ion of the gr< a
capabilities it has of supplying not onM
England, hut the whole world if neccs
snrv."?\nd again he says?" We thin!
enou :K has ?cen said loshew, that then
is neither want of cotton soil for the inch
genous nor the American plant, and w<
may with confidence assert, hs the knowl
edge of soils and climate becomes more
and more stupid and attended to. that In
dia will prove capable of producing cot.
ton of any quality ; and to any extent."
l)r. Spray, a botanist, oncofthe Com
panys servants in Bengal, recently sta
tijd before the Royal Asiatic Society?
44 It is certainly without a parallel it
the annals of the world, that a countr
possessing such capacities as India, shouh
have been so long hen metrically sealed a
gainst the enterprise of Britons, in orde
to prolong the abuses of patronage. Ha<
the peninsula been open, we should no
now be dependant upon America for rav
cotton, nor would the country have beei
brought, as it was four years ago, to th<
very verge of bankruptcy and revolution
when the stock of cotton was notadequatt
to three week's consumption. To thi
astounding blunder the Southern divisioi
of the United States owes its cotton plan
tations. and its rice-fields, and also th<
blighting course of Slavery. JKvidenc<
confirms the fact, that cotton can b<
grown in India, fully equal, or rather su
perior, to the bulk of American."
Kirkman Finally, Esq., in a communi
cation to the Chumbtr of Commerce
Manchester, says?
"India is a country of such vast re
sources, with 9uch abundance of scil ad
pted to the cultivation of cotton, such s
???
| variety of climate. and such an immense (
' laboring population, that it appears of all ?
e others, best fitted to become a cotton- .
e : growing country, and to send an article j
r of the finest quality, and in the greatest r
i abundance." 1
e Mr. John Gladstone, an authority in t
1 commercial matters, savs? (
a 44 For the supplv of the raw material J
we are almost wholly dependent on for- !
?| eign countries, whilst we . a eand possess 1 J
1 in the British dominions in India, re? o irces ,
t sufficient to niipply all we require an i to t
s an in leased extent ifdemanded;|resources <
^ that are within our influence and control, '
f and where the only limit to the con?ump- (
tion of British manufactures is the ability 1
a of the natives to pav for them ; whilst we
-! possess at the same tirne the means to j
o : stimulate and increase our intercourse ! i
t with safety and advantage to the empire <
. at large." 1
J Mr. George AshK r or, in a paper read J
* before the Asiatic Society, remarks? ,
t "Labor in central India is cheaper than , f
a in almost any other portion of the world ;
0 the wages of an ahle-bedied man being t
i, only three rupees [six shillings sterli gj I
v per month. It has been estimated, tlier.*
t fore, that Bcrar cotton may be cultivated 1
n profitably for 30 rupees per candy, rr for
ri rather than a penny a pound !" ,
s The next question for the American (
e investigator of a question of the deepest
h interest is. what obstacles have prevented
' the development of enpahil ties in India '
* to supply the country under whose gov- {
U eminent, she groans. >vith an article from ,
which, were she suddenly cut ofT, the very ,
* existence of that government would be i
1 endange e . An answer to this inquiry t
- in the view of the writer before us w;ll he j
II found in the extracts wiiich follow, (
' and if well founded would appear to ac- J
i count fully, os well for deficiency of sup- ,
R ply. as for defectiveness of qualiiv.
N In our next we shah present the views 11
? of this pains taking writer as to the m< a- i
6 sure* and causes which mav he expected '
I to operate in the removal of the obstacles 1
s here designat? d. and to insu e to Great '
> Britain an ample supplv of this great sta
- pie of our slave holding St tes "rom a reg. ,
3 ion under her own controui, and of a |
r quality to meet all demands. I
^ " The chief obstacle however t cotton- j
* growing in the East, and indeed the great f
cause of most of the evils of In la, lies in 1
> the nature of the government th it con- f
* trol its destinies?a government which r
1 acts, not for the benefit of its subjects, r
* but the aggrandizement of itself. Wres
ing from the natives the proprietorship of jc
J the soil, it imposes on them taxes unoer j ^
which no people could flourish. It sul *
jec'8 them to a system of forced lahor
? and purveyance, which, allowing no se'
curity for property, takes awav the motive
* to its accumulation. The insolence, ex5
actions and cruelties of its officers in ma ny
? cases leaves no refuge to the m c
1 rahle native hut absolute poverty. Nothf
ing scarcely is planned or < x u^dfirthe
1 good ot the country ; a few nabobs think j
* themselves entitled to < oin money out of 1
I a hundred mil'ion people, though their
p licy, so far as the accunulition of c
1 wraith is concerned, is scarcely so wise
* as the slave system o ' t! e South. The f
f virtual assumption hy the government of c
' the proprietorship of the soil, is the root of i
^ them-schief. It has proclaimed itself the F
> universal landlord, and affirm d its right 1
to take from its tenants what it will. Be. |
3 fore the country came under British rule, f
- <h Hindoo or 3/ahomrnedan sovereign (
3 claimed as a tax a limited portion of the I
* crop of every man's field, leaving not less i
s than thrre-fourths to the farmer. The j F
* British gevernment takes the whole mat- jj
i tcr into its own hands?fixes an assumed
* capability in every field to produce, an as1
sunied price of the produce itself, and
? then exacts from 35 to 45 percent, of the \
money value of that produce as its share e
* forever;?and all this, without any re- *
* ference to vary i ng crops or prices ! When
3 the produc exceeds the amount previous- '
^ Ivf fixrd, the assessment is increased. s
When an individual fails, in the payment t
* of his tax. it is collected ofF the village. :
; When the crop of a whole village is de- t
3 ficient, neighboring villages are compelled ! y
3 to make up the deficiency. 45 parts in a j!
" 100 of the gross produce of the soil are
3 taken hv the government. As to the f
1 cultivator his average share of the gross,,
' poduce is stated to he generally from five j t
to six in a hundred ! The tax too is de4
manded in money;?a most grinding j'
* hardship in a country, where the people |;
depend more upon barter, than a circula- j
5 ting medium. ,
The effects of the land-tax are repre- f
? scnted as most destructive villages, in |
tiro spast happy and flourishing S'av< be-in f
desolated by it, and the cubivalors in nu- 1
merous districts driven from their fams, '
so that large tracts of land once ocnupicd, j
are now covered with jungle and ranged .
by wild beasts. It has beggared the in- /
1 dustrious Ryot, and converted him into a
^ robber or assassin. And there is perhaps I
not one of the many families under which
India of late years hu? groaned, that may
^ not be traced to its blighting influences. *
In louo-3, a famine prevailed 11 m?
north-western provinces of Bengal, which '
v carried off, it is said, 5U0.000 human be1
ings, more than the whole population o? ,
2 Illinois. And yet the same year, as ;
' much gpain was exported from the lowe? ]
B parts of Bengal, as would have fed half a
million of people, at a pound of rice a day t
for a whole year. The Oriental Herald (
* for February, 1839. states, thatu in 1819 .
there were 19,676.076 beegas or abou
6 558,692 acres of waste land, in th<
provinces where half a million ofhumar ,
beings died last year from actual starvn (
tion." While immense tracts of fertil f
land have been abandoned, and other ,
' suffered to remain the haunts of the tige (
and jackall the natives ef fh?? country ,
the rea , bonajide proprietors of tf?e soi', *r<
* riot, n!Joweil to bring any porwon ol diein un
* der cultivation, except < n payment of whatev. 4
r amount of taxation mav be impost hy the
[ovornmenf, which is so heavy as in man]
nstances, soon to derive off the new settlers.
The pertinacious adherence of the Board o
Directors to this ruinous system, seems to a
noun' to madness. In the year 1335, Sn
lobert Grant issued a proclamation, offering
o those who would cultivate waste land, free
lom from taxation for five years, and f o i
ialf the usual amount of taxation, the nex
ive. Afier the natives had overcome ihei
listrust. of thisstrange kindness on the parte
he government, | hey began to avail them
selves of the offer, and, und'T a system whicl
secured to abor its just reward, soon shown
jvhat they could do. Tlie Court of Dir- c'nrs
lowexer in ess than three years, as if ben
>n kee )ing down all improvement in the counry,
ord> red the offers to be recalled !
The Rev. Howard Mali om ?f Boston wrote
? hVb 1337 A more boau'ifui countrj
:han that from Cuddalo e to Tanjore. (.Ifad
is.) cannot poasibly he imagin d. Th<
lense population and rich soil give thei
nergies to each other, and produie a seem

b :?! (it) pi ru*n ! llut the mode of collc-c
i<?n in money causes the cul'ivator to pay a?
?o it tliree-fotir*hs of the crop."
This grinding land'tax, then, destroying, a
it dors, the hope and energy of the laborer
ind weakening ftie motives ;o ;he?vorch?e o
ikill and carefulness, is the first and greates
bst ide to the free growth ot cotton in In
J:,i.
f everal other obstacles may be noticed.
1. The almost absoiute dependence of the
eti:|"i?.a'ors on iheir hankers The yfowere
:ct'??n, in the b ginning of the wason, with >u
? ed, without money, is obligd to a?>py t<
'he village hanker, who lends his mon-'V o<
ron lition, first, that h? receive exorbitant in
ferest. secondly, th u the enthe crop he ?o!
:<> him i:i advance,"at a I w price. Such 1 a
lain, of course, la';eg away all motives o
carefulness in raising and prepar ng 'he co.
fon. inasmuch as the grower knows that lb
lie will get no more for a good than bail ar
tide
2. The revenue officers frequently will n*>
suffer the crop to he tone he till socurity h
jivop for *he payment of the land-tax. Moati
(imp. the crop ripens; t ie cot'on falls to tli<
rround, and b -coming mixed with leaves ant
lu*', is greaily deteriorated.
3. The country is without good roadf
Tl ere are no facilities 'or carrying the cot
on of C -n'ral India to the coast. Raised il
Bera for instance, it has to he carried ?o Bom
?ay. 00 mil p, on the backs of oxen, thi
oi r ?'-v occupying 75 day--, and :i*
-onveyance being 80 ^-r cent, on first cost
\nd it not unfrrquently happens, that heav
ams overtake it on the way, so that larg
piantities are annuallv destioyed or greatly da
naged. The finer kinds it *? sa:d, are fa
nore injured by th rains than the inferior
?hence another inducement to send commoi
:oton
4. The cotton is often seriously injur-d ht
ieing brought in'o the government vards
vhero, it the owners cannot immediately pa;
he taxes, it is buried in the ground, no strav
>r matting being interposed between it an<
he -arth.
5. It is stated that in Egypt and Peru, cot
on could not be grown at all, without the aii
if artificial irrigation. No good cotton is im>or!ed
into Great Britain from warm climates
vhich has not been irrigated. In India, ai
f to compel the growth cf common cotton irr
fated lands are doubly taxed, sometimes tre
>1 or quadruplv.
Mr. George Thompson thus sums up iIi<
lifficuhies in the production of cotton.
44 N >w look at the difficulties in the way o
[rowing cotton : First, the absence of p o.
inptiry right in ibe s<?il. Here is the master,
fvil; here s the great i (justice of our admin
Ft rat ion in India, depriving the natives of th<
oil of their right to that soil; utterly d?-9pis.
ng them ; sweeping off all the grpat landlordi
md all the little ones together ;r ckoning di.
cc'*y with the cultivator of the individual
ield, and taking f om him at least 45 pur c? n'
?f the gros-* produce of the soil. Then, th<
leavy nnd fluctuating assessnne ts;fhen the
itter dependence upon the village bankers
noducing, as you have seen, carelessness it
{rowing, in pack.ng, and in cleaning the cot.
on. Then the damage done to the cottnr
in itsji urney from the in'erior to the coast
Then the insufficient acc< mmodatinn, or rath
t no accommodation at all, which it findi
vhen it has arrived at the coast ; for youlTavi
een. that in Guzerai, though a part of Ipdis
is well managed as any other part, it is turn
led into a pit, covered with lumps of earth
ind 'here it I es to contract moisture, and i
lotnes up in a s' ate perfect ly unfit to he packed
ind embarked for this country. But again
liere is tne want of care, on the part of the naive?
I 'limit, n respect to soils -ind situations
hen the noiuintroduction of foreign seeds
vhich is a very important part of the business
.his. the want of the mean* of transportation
hen the negligence and capper of the roveni?-officer*.
who of'en ihr- i:gh mere ois n hnit

act tha? other crops are grown along wit I

None of those hindrances, it will be observed

icter of the people. A wise government couli
