TIIE DAY OF JUDGMENT.
A VIHIOX.
Methought the day of Judgment came. The sun,
As if its chariot wheols had broken down,
Stood stili. And the quick pulse of nnturo throbbed
In the wild phrensy of dismuy.T.The liand
Of iron labor plied its busied toil.
All frantic ploasurc did her incense burn
To idols vain. Ambition bout the sails
* Of Barks luinumbcred on*lifc'a_glassy wave.
V7.U UIUU liiu imruy buip vfi unwipiov
Aroused: And earth, as hour by hour, was fraught
With sounds confused, tho hum of mon and things.
But suddenly there seemed a stillness deep
(You might liavo heard the rolling of the spheres
In harmony of movement sweetly drawn)
Followed by spasms of earth. Mcphitic clouds
In darksome masses nee, as if, at last,'
Old Aetna, or Stroinboli had their way,
Throughout the hollowed globo in fury mined.
And rolled tho muffled drum earth's last dead march!!
Birds fell dead. By unheard storm the fig tree
Shook; and all trees cast their fruit untimely.
To man's foot crawled the gasping snake and died
Tho timid hind, by shaft unseen transfixed,Hf
Dropped at tho fann house door, whilst big tears
I
coarseti v. i ^
Ail own his silken veil of light, and death
Sealed up the avenues of sense.
O'er all things fell the pall of night in folds,
Damp, sulpluirous,Jaiid vast.** And it wag..dark! . An
awful pauso in human life, ensued:
Man gazed on man; nrfd githorod from each scowl
Sad contirmation of despair. Hut look!
Kvrie Elccson! Mercy save!
A light of glory flashing through the air,
Around the form of heaven's Archangel floatp,
Who in his puissant hand the trump of God
Uplifted hears. One foot is on the sen:
And one the oarth but lightly treads. Silence!
Hie trumpet sounds; Men held their breath. Eac'i'
nerve
Of life quivered. Deep answered deep. And then
Those word', those awful words:?O earth give car:
Thy doom is fixed: I swear by Him who Is,
And Was, and Shall be, Tiinc shall be no more!
For'h.vith the sun became as blood, and from
H s shining sphere to black oblivion lull.
Arcturun, Orion and Pleiades
With all their burning hosts likt drops- of hail,
Before tin- siroc, passed. The boiling sea
In vapor rose; and left, its caverns bare.
The deep foundations of the hasting hills
Were thrown on level with the verdant plain.
Earth's pillows bowed. Pyramids and towns,
High palaces, and every domicile
Came down; and tho round world (lor so it socir.cdli
Became ruin's wide spread fielU. Again
Tltc Angel sounded; and those words of fo.ir
In solemn accents came;?ye quick and dead
To judgment rise; Eternity is now.
And then the sea gave up her dead; and earth
Its denizens reloascd: bones, nerves and all
The parts divorce of man's anatomy,
Started to life from coral rocks and beds
Of matted roods, oceans charm 1 hnust;
I
And from the dust of ruin blown by tunc
On ro.stlc.vS winds throughout the world. The dead
In countloss throngs got up; and 60uls of quick
Tolifo immortal wore transformed, and both,
With cyo undimmcd, tho bar of heaven beheld
In all tho terrors of the law arrayed.
Around the throne thore broko a rain bow light
An omcrald most liko. translucent with
Sapphires and rubies and all precious sloncs
Impavcd, whereon the sea of glory rolled
Its waves of bliss fast by the sacred Book
Sealed with the mandates of the Living Hod!
Ma thought the Son of man aroso to look
The sentence of his court; and then a strain
Of music most seraphic, from the harps
Of Cherubim, Salvation's Ilymns of praise
From ransomed of the Lord echoed. But hark!
Tho last trump! And earth's vital spark is quenched.
The funeral pile is built, ruin's torch
T.io mi-s onflimes; and all the world's on fire!
B it O the shrieks of ruined souls arose
Above the crackling flame and rolling smoke,
Louder and louder still, in agony
O* wo. O -acred God! what sights and sounds
Are thoso for mortal sense to note, and live!

Carrying concealed Weapons.?
When Caesar was advise:! by his friend
to be more cautious of security of in
person, and not to walk among the peo
pie without arms or any one to defene
him, he always replied to the admonitions
"He that lives in fear of death every moment
feels its tortures?I will die bill
once."
Why, brave men?citizens whose duty
it is to cultivate the arts of peace, shoulc
go habitually armed, making an arsena
of their persons, lias always appeared i
us an inscrutable mystery?we couit
never divine it. Wc see but two horns t(
the dilemma?such a man momentaril)
afraid of his own life, and his mind i:
therefore eternally on the rack, or, he bu
pants for an opportunity to act the assas
sin, and therefore little better than a fienc
in human form, to be despised by the tru
ly brave man and abhorred by the mai
govcrncd by religious principles. It i:
not characteristic of brave nations to car
ry concealed weapons, nor is it, so far a:
our observation has extended, indicative
of brave men. Concealc/j weapons arc
the insigr.a of a footpad, the burglar ant
flip mnrppnnrv hrnv_r? and l?v ll?p tnmi mi.
ccnscioiisaf wrong and fearless of dang -i
ilicy never should be worn.
The South is accounted chivalrous, truly
chivalrous, and well has she earned thai
prcud distinction, Ilcr sons never faul
tercd in the charge, nor retreated before
the enemy, but were always first to do
battle for their rights?last to lay dowr
their arms while these rights w.-r withheld
from them. Now the question Southerns
should ask themselves is, "Will tlk
habit of incessantly carrying concealed
weapons preserve to us that brave and
chivalrous character which we havegaincc
in many a well fought field.- or rather, is ii
not calculated to sink us d own to the level
of Spanish brigands or piratical as&as
sins?" To this last interrogatory the
breast of every American must beat a responsive
yes. We do hope to see the
time when every man who carries concealed
weapons will be looked upon ir
the degraded light of a loafer, or worse?
we wish to see the potential voice of the
public opinion frown the system down, foi
"it is more honored in the breach than ii
tluTOt)servenre*" nnd with f'rr>;nr be,lievc
that "Tie who lives in fear of dcatl
every moment feels its tortures."

Steam fire Engine.?The Gold Mc
dal of the Mechanics' Institute, awarder
by the Committee on Ails and Sciences
was last week presented to Capt. J. Erics
son, by the Vice President of the Associa
tion, in presence of a very full meeting
The medal was awarded in pursuance of;
' i i -?* /n
resolution passcu uunng luu j>jc?uuju^ ^
incendiarism last winter, for the best plai
of a steam fire engine. The number o
plans originally submitted was live, on<
of which was withdrawn by the inventor
leaving four for competition. The sue
cessful plan is that of an engine weighing
less than 2 1-4 tons, that with the lowcs
estimated speed has a power of 108 men
and will throw 3000 lbs of water pei mi
mite to a height of 105 feet, through a noz
zle of 1 1-2 inches diameter. By increa
sing the speed to the greatest limit easih
and safely attainable, the quantity of wa
tcr thrown may be much augmented.
The Vice President, in the necessar;
absence of the President of the Associa
lion, read a very neat and well writtci
address in tendering the medal. Cap!
Ericsson replied in a short but pcrtincn
acknowledgment, and then in accordant

POLICY OF THE BANKS.
The public will see in the scrap taken
from the Pendleton newspaper, the cause
of the low prices, and the pressure every
where. There is no doubt that the reduction
of the circulating medium of the
banks is one third in amount: their continued
suspension to prevent the hoard" 1 specie
from being brought to the relief of the
country, and the suspension of trade, as
far as possible, b v the banking interests,
is all part of a settled system to control
the Presidential election. The moment
that is over, no matter how it goes, the(
whole face of affairs will be changed.
"Policy op the Bank Party.?The
followiin? naraoranh from the Pendleton
or o i
Messenger, discloses the policy of the
Bank party to operate on the'corning elections.
This lias been, and is their game
every where:"
"4 We understand a lett2r has been received
here, from an intelligent gentleman
from ' ieorgia, (we believe he is a Harrison
man,) which states, that the Georgia
banks are now in a condition to resume
specie payments, and that they will do so
after the election. This is equivalent to
a declaration, that although the passage
of the Sub-Treasury bill has not, as was
predicted, destroyed the banks, yet the
banks have resolved to continue the pressure
on the people, by refusing to fulfil
their obligations, till after the elections, in
order to keep up the cry of hard times,

Refinement.?One of the latest touches
of the exquisite in literature we find in
the last Boston Evening Gazette. Instead
of saying "lie that dances should pay the
tidier," that paper has it. "lie that dancea
should compensate the violinist." The latest
i:3, however, in the Boston Courier.
"Tell Chapman to crow," is a saying
which has been for some time past quite
current in the political papers. But the
language is now considered quite unpolished;
therefore it is proposed that instead
of using that coarse, dictatorial blunt expression,
"tell Chapman to crow," we
should say: indicate to Mr Chapman to
officiate as cockerel."
The last Shark Story.?As an offset
to the Ship news wYgn
Urteans1 ricayline tells tTie following story:;
Once upon a time, when the packet l
ship Coriolanus was returning from Liver-!
pool to New York, t!ic carpenter, a very j
worthy man, was taken sick, and after i
brief illness expired on shipboard. lie;
had an interesting son, who was his assis- j
tant as ship carpenter, and the boy loved |
his father with the most tender and filial
affection. The poor youth's heart was!
almost broken at the loss of his parent,
and no persuasion couid induce him to
leave the body.
The usual preparations for a funeral at
sea were made; the poor carpenter was
sewed up in his winding sheet, and with
him was put an old grindstone, hatchet
and chisel, to carry him down to his long
rest in the ocean. The poor boy grew
frantic when his father was about to be
committed to the waves; and was obliged
to beheld off by the sailors. At length,
just as the lata! lurch or the vessel was inking
place, the boy, with the strength of
a maniac, broke from the sailors and
dashed himself upon the body at the very
moment that it was sliding over the ship's
side. It was too late to save him, and
clinging wildly to the dead body of his father,
the hapless boy was seen to make
one swift plunge, and disappear forever
down, down, into the cternai caverns of
t the mighty ocean.
, This was in lat. 97?long. 79, which
was duly entered on the log-book. The
Coriolanus arrived at New York, completed
all the business preparatory for her
next trip, and she sailed again for Liveri
pool.
i Take in a long breath reader, it's comt
ing.
, When in lat. 09?long. 48, an cnor:
mous shark was caught, and when hauled
i upon deck a most extraordinary noise
; seemed to proceed from the huge monster's
stomach. The creature was opened,
and there was the father, the son, the
(rrindstone. the hatchet and the chisel.
O- -V"T # O,
ifit aint true, then never may another
fish story be believed! The poor carpenter
had not died, but was only in a trance
when they buried him, and there ho was
' sharpening his hatchet, while the son was
I turning the grindstone! they having resolved
to cut their way out of' the shark's
stomach!
Col. Johnson vs. Tecumseh.?Co 1. Johnson,
in a late speech gave some account
of the battle of the Thames. In his
i speech occurs the following passage:
"Mv brother James, and a braver and
! better "man never lived, charged through
the Ihifish. with one half of the batfa
' ton,
while I with the other half, undert
ook to rouse up the Indians in the swamp.
They were not hard to rouse up; fur Tecuioseh,
a man transccndantly superior to
Proctor, in point of real braver}', as Hyperion
fo a Satyr, had determined to make that
his best and most conclusive battle ground.
We met them and fought thcni: and,
when they learned Procter's Br tLsh regulars
had been demolished by my brother
James, they began to retire. At this moment
my body had been perforated by five
bullets, and my horse could only be kept
on his less by the greatest exertions of
my bridle hand. In endeavoring to make
him leap over a log in the swamp, he fell
and died, with two more balls in his carcase
than were in my own. A tail, good
looking Indian approached me with his
tomahawk ready for a throw. My horse
lay in a position that did not permit me to
be exactly dismounted. I pulled out a
loaded pistol from my holsters, and shot
him. They say it was Tecumseh. I care
not, and I know not: I would have shot
the best Indian that ever breathed under
such circumstances, without inquiring his
name, or asking the age of his children."
The women of the Revolution.?The
following is an extract from a letter written
by a lady of high rank and accomplishments,
Residing in Philadelphia, to
a British officer living in Boston. It was
sent to him soon after the battle of Bunker
Ilill, and circulated at that trme
throughout the colonics, in the Revolution?

From the N. Y. Journal of Commerce.
State of Alabama ?No member of
the Union has fulfill* i her engagements
with greater punctuality lha i the State of
Alabama. The only debt she owes, is
that invested in the capital slock of her
I Banks. The first half million of her
bonds became due in London the present
year; and although the Style reserved its
right to extend the period of their redemption,
the whole sum due was anticipated
and paid by the Dunks for which it was
issued.
The interest upon another portion of
the debt, payment in New York and New
Orleans in November and December, is
already provided. A part of that Hue in

ward: and the ( reat Western carries
with her to-day, remittances to cover the
residue. Indeed all the payments of the
State prior to April ""841, are thus anticipated.
The Legislature of Alabama, at its last <
session, passed an act recalling the whole
of the Stale R n*'s i<-n. ! an ?till unsold.
These have ult been accordingly returned
and cancelled, thus leaving the State debt,
810.800.000. The Gov rnor also in his
iu . :v< sage to the Legislature, recommended
the establishment -if a sinking
fund for the gradual exting * ' ?'f ihis
debt, and this judicious im us.. < will in
all probability be adopted the ensuing session.
With an annual export of Cotton,
worth at in present low price, twenty
millions of dollars; with a very trifling
amount of imports during the past and
present year, and with a faithful and economical
policy in the management of her
finances, the State of Alabama ought to
rank amongst the highest in credit, as
she is in her resources.
