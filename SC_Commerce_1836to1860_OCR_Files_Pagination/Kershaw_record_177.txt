himself* throwing his hat on the ground,
and swinging back his clock, which ho at
the same tunc twisted round his arm,
stood in a moment with t drawn knife in
his hand ready for the conflict. Remarking
the movement of Dolores, he called

looking round, "And you, Caballoros,

as he turned towards the officer,
" but I know you?you are one who has

well he was hatod by the lower classes of
the people iu the neighborhood, and by
the Scrvilles, 011 account of the zeal with
which he had distinguished himself iu the
pursuit of robbers, contranhandisls, and
people oi that description. He hesitated,
then, a short lime, whether he should engage
in a duel with such an enemy, or
should cull in the arm of the law to his
assistance; but the desire of adventure,
natural to so young a man, roso within
him, and lie was ashamed, whon opposed
only to a single adversary, to have the
appearance of calling for help.

not venture on any interference; and besides,
felt little about the whole affair,
except anxiety for Christoval, awaited
the event in fearful prayer; while Paquita
spoke courage to her amidst the most tender
carasscs. ''Only becalm, my angel,
only be quite quiet my Rose," she whispered
to her, 44 not a hair of Christoval
will be injured. Do not cry so, my life?
believe me, for I understand the matter.
Christoval,- with his knife, has nothing
to fcarfrom the long sabre. The young officer
may say his last ave, if he has not forgotten
it?the impisus freemason! And,
yet, it is a pity; for he is a smart youth."
The extraordinary combat, had, in tho
meantime, begun. Not unacquainted |
with the fearful weapon of Ins antagonist,;

the officer stood in a calm altitude on his

ready either to culorihiust. He knew
lie was lost, without hope of escape, if
he did not lay his antagonist low at the
first stroke, and he followed his movements

bull-fighter who stood amongst the crowd,
and observed the fight with the eye of a
connoisseur.
The cloak .now seemed to slip from
Christoval's left aim, and whilst lie endeavored
to gather it up again, he exposed
himself, in some degree; to his adversary,
who, thinking the right moment
had arrived, rushed forward, and aimed
a powerful blow at his adversary's head,
but sank at the same moment to the
ground, with a faint cty. The apparent.
olippling oft* of the cloak was only a feint
of Christoval's, by which he might mislead
hta mlvcroaiy into some impi udent
movement. Receiving the blow on his
cloak, he sprang forward at the same moment,
with the quickness of Mghlning,
on his adversary, like the tiger on his
prey, and thrust the knife from below,
under the ribs, into his left side; and such
was the force of the blow, together with
that of the spring, that he tore the unhappy
man's body open, completely across,
so that the trunk only hung to the under
body by the bones of the spine, while the
numerous layers of his thick woollen
cloak had defended Christoval from every
injury.
' God be merciful to his poor soul!"
said he, wjth an agitation which he with
difficulty suppressed, while the persons
around, keeping silence for a moment,
gnzeu on tno terrific wound.
' Well struck, Chrislovjil!" cried Estoban
at last, giving his hand to his cousin;

Washington's lifeguard.? The passage
of the Schuylkill.?Tho life-guard
was a major's command, Qibbs, of Ithodo
Island,' a gallant ofliccr, and celebrated
martinet, major Collax, a fino young
man from New Jersey, and much esteemed
in the army, captains Grymos and
Nicholas, of Virginia, brave and valued
ofliccrs, lieutenant ami ensign, with one
hundred and eighty picked men, rank and
tile. The uniform blue, with white faciugs,
white under-clothcs, and black gaiters.
'i he horse-guard was detailed from va-|
rioutf corps during the contest. In the
is earliest campaigns, from Bavlor's regiment,
which was called lady Washington's
dragoons?uniform white, with blue facings*
&c. The life-guard always attached
to the hcad-quurlers, was admired as
well for its superior appearance as for its
high state of discipline, it being considered,
m the olden time,-as a matter of
. distinction to serve in the guard of the
commander-in-chief.
The life-guard wab borrowed by favorite
officers for several important expeditions.
In the oflair of Barren Hill, May,
;'78, the life-guard formed a part of tliei
t troops under tho marquis de Lafuyctic,

I ill the preceding campaign, in *78, mode
his debut in arms as u general officer.?
I The position of Barren Hill becoming
extremely hazardous, on account ot two
! heavy columns of the enemy thut were
I marching to intercept the communication
of the marquis with the main army at
jVa'lcy Forge, the young general determined,
by a gullunt dash between the ad[
vancing columns, to reach the ford 011 the
! Schuylkill, and thus secure his retreat to
the main army. Here let our narration
pause, while we pay a well-merited tribute
to the niemoiy and services of Alien1
M'Lanc, to whose untiring vigilance in
watching the stealthy approach of the
enemy's columns towards Barren Hill,
and promptness in attacking them on their ,
route, tho marquis was mainly indebted 1
for success in the celebrated retreat that
shed such lustre on his first command.
In Allen M'L'iue we have the recollection
a partisan who, with genius to conceive,
possessed a courage even to chivalry
to execute, the most daring enterprise s;
who ever ranked with the foremost in esteem
of the chief, and was considered by
the whole aiiny as one of the most intre
I pit! anil distinguished uiliccrs of the war
I of the revolution.
When the retiring Americans reached
the ford of the Schuylkill, they hesitated
in attempting the passage. Lafayette
sprang from his horse rushed into the
water waist deep, calling on his comrades
to follow. Animated by the example
of their youthful general, the soldiers
entered the river, the taller men sustaining
the shorter, and after a severe strugO
3
gle gained the southern or friendly shore,
having suffered but inconsiderable loss.
Meanwhile, the enemy were in close
pursuit, and the commander-in-chief, fearing
for the detachment, which consisted
of his choicest troops, including the lifeguard,
drugged his artillery to the pocky
heights thai commanded the road, and
opened upon the enemy's ad vance, cheek
ing them so far as to enable the marquis
the better to secure bis retreat; and thenwas
one feature in the martial spectacle
of the passage of the Schuylkill of rare
and imposing interest: it was the admired
form of Washington; at times obscured,

On the morning of the battle of Monmouth,
June, '78, a detachment from the
life-guard, and one from Morgan's riflemen,

party of tlio enemy which they had surprised
while washing at a brook that ran
through an extensive meadow. Seventeen
grenadiers were made prisoners, and
borne off in the very face of the British
' light-infantry, who tired upon their daring
assailants, and immediately commenced
a hot pursuit; yet Long displayed
such cousuinmato ability as well as courage,
that he brought off his party, prisoners
and all, with only the loss of one
sergeant wounded.
Morgan was in waiting, at the outpost,
to receive the detachment on their return,
having listened, with much anxiety, to
the heavy fire of the pursuing enemy.

unharmed, and in the prisoners taken,

worth the experiment of so small a sum, in u matt r
of so much consequoncc. He therefore sent tlv mo|

that of tho Slate upon an uncertainty. Meantime, (
