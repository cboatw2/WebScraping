ion, he looked on tho bill moot favorably; and
ipoke with a complete resolution to maintain all
tar rights oyer the territory, which could bo cxrrneed
an eeulerssity with the treaty.
Mr. Lino said that the 8cnator had, with groat
ems and truth, compared the mighty flow el
spslalioa westward to tho rolling in of n groat
md wide etreem. But he ebeuld remember that
be policy of tbo Government itself baa of late, in
he disposition made of many of the greater Indian
iribea, rained op artificial barriers, which have at
iresent stopped that natural spread of population.
On tbefSouth and tho Southwest it' has reached
wr limits. This outlet of the West must be openid,
or it will break across the bounds within which
we have pledged ourselves that the expatriated
Indian tribca shall dwell securely. The Oregon
region must be opened to tho adventurous and
uigroiury spirit wi our people, or UIA Collected
Hood must eoon burst ov<y, and sweep away th?
Indian, to wboiq we hare pledged ourselves sr
undisturbed refuge in the home to which we have
by so humane a policy, transplanted him.
The Senator regards this bill as going new ant
dangerous lengths. Yet the bills introduced wit!
the same object, long since, under Mr. Monroe ant
Mr. Adams, by Gen. Floyd, were far stronger.?
They provided for the erecting forts and custom
houses. As for that formidable and perpetual im
pediment, the treaty, it existed then just as mucl
as now.
Adverting then to the English claims, as foun
ded on alleged discovery, Mr. Linn treated tin
pretended visit of Mcars and others to the moutl
of the Columbia as altogether preposterous. Th
narrative itself, which describes a region bound nj
in ribs of ice in the month of June, makes it im
possible for any one now to believe thut Mcars'
visit was to the Columbia?a const never witness
ing such regions of cold, even in mid.wintcr, ant
enjoying a soft temperature oven in tho carlit
spring.
But, in truth, this whole British claim is rcconl
[t arcs never heard of aa against the discovery o
Dept. Gray or Uto explorations of Lewis an<
Clarke. As late as 1812, the question of our die
coverv was minutclv examined in one of ih<
0 ?loading
British millvoritics on ouch question?, th<
Edinburgh Review, and our claim admitted as in
controvertible.
As to what England tnay urge of the Noolki
Sound treaty with Spain, it is sufficient to my tha
any such claim inust havo fallen with that treat;
itaclr, temporary in its character, and spcedil;
dissolved by tho war which occurred between tb
two oountries soon after. Our right he placed 01
the strong and certain ground of discovery.
The Senator from South Carolina had urgci
that we should, first of all, give the twelve moutlu
notice of our renunciation of the treaty. lie coul<
only answer that ho himself hod repeatedly urge*
that course in former years, but always in vaim?
He bad ever been met with tho answer: " This i
not the proper time?wait." Meanwhile the ad
verse English possession was going on, fortifying
from yoar to year, the British claim and tho Bril
ish resources to make it good. Two successiv
Presidents bad encouraged the bold and well-ar
ranged scheme of Aslor to fortify and to colonize
But we suffered him to be dispossesKd, and th
nuclous of empire, which his establishment
would have formed, to pass into the hand
of tin Hudson Bay Company, now the great in
strument of all the British scheme of possession.
Tho Senator insists that, by the treaty, thor
should be a joint possession. Be it so, if he will
but where is our part of this joiut possession ? Ii
wbut does it consist or has it consisted ? Wo hav<
no post their, no agent, nobody to protect trader
?nay, in truth, no traders: for they are butcherci
as soon as tliey appear there, either by the Britisl
agents, or those savages whom they can alwayi
make the instruments of such systematic massacr
of adventurous rivals. Of the extent of the*
murders, or of the regularity with which they wen
employed, the Senator had probably but little no
tion. He could aamro him that, before the vea
1829, there had perished in this way, as was arc)
ascertained, full Are hundred men, and the year!
slaughter has gone on ever since.
But whut has ever been the history of you
peopling of those distant regions, always to be din
puted with something which this Govcrnmen
shrinks from encountering? You hare neve
failod to turn your back upon every such hard]
enterprise. The very navigation of the Mississip
pi, for forty years, would have been yielded U
Great Britain but that it required the assent 01
nine States to briog it into the validity of a treaty
Six Eastern States were ready to abandon it foi
an interest the most wretchedly disproportionate
If that mighty access to a new and greater cm
pire of the West has been preserved to you. it it
in spito of your supine noes, in spite of your timidily,
in spite of your impolicy.
As for me (said Mr. L ) I desire in this irrcsisti.
>lc advance of our population, destined to carry to
he very verge of the continent tho bench's of our
ircc laws, to march with every public right in the
oad, while wc carry to those regions of barbarism
ho Bible and the plough-share. And I would
ven in these great purposes, halt rather than to
folate our national faith solemnly pledged in a
rcaty. But I tell the Senator that we cannot
bus rigidly adhere to what our rival so little re.
ards. That Senator does not know, or has overwked,
the progress which British possession has
cen for twenty years making against us, under
over of tho Hudson Bay Company, the irrespon.
ibis instrument c.~ British power in that quarter,
y means of which wo and this treaty are steadily
ircumvcntcd. There, on in the East, Britain
rrparcshcr way to uncheeked dominion through
te stealthy advance of tlicso trading companies,
'hieh scatter the seeds thai are to spring up into a
irvnt of power for her.

Neither Government was, as a Government, to
do any thing to divest the citizens of the other of
the enjoyment of the com moo freedom of that
country. Certainly if wan^criog subjects of either
made, at their own risk, establishments tliere,
neither woo csBed onto iirtbta Bet oa, by
this bill, do an set to hinder some port ef this traol
' from being any longer ay en, eaeept to our otrn
people. Wo take and are to maintain exclusive
. possession, guarantying to settlors, otter five years'
i residence, a (be simple of the lea be they may occupy.
Mr. C. hero entered into a minute view of one
interpretation of the treaty, which might at first
I have seemed Doaaibla?that either Government
was to be at liberty to invite colonisation. As,
i however, no such view was advanced on the oth.
I cr side as warranting our measures of occupation,
i and as Mr. C. certainly allowed how little any
I such purpose could have entered into the treaty,
I or was practicable in itself, we need not follow
; his very skilful and elaborate Argument on that
i point.
, He went on to urge that there had been no ap.
propriatton of territory until 1833, the country be1
ing freely used, on both parts only as a hunting,
i ground; that the languago of our own envoys,
1 Messrs. Gallatin and Rush, made it clear that
they regarded all occupation of the country for
- any purpose more fixed, as prohibited by the con.
. vention ; that England has been equally guarded
1 in the sort of possession which she allowed her
subjects to dcrivd from her, limiting her licenses
to tliem, always to the right of hunting, and guard,
c ing even in such licenses against all exclusion of
i our citizens.
c The Senator from South Carolina was there|>
fore right; our legislation (if we pass such a bill
. aa this) will not cotnpnrr, in justice and fuith, with
a that of Great Britain.
Let ua then build forts; that is permitted by
1 our engagements; and aa England sends her jur
riadiction thither to her citizens, let us send ours
to our own.
Mr. Linn answered briefly that the gentleman
f was but reviving against Iand.grants, the very arI
guinents used in 1831 against what he was now
willing to admit, tho erection of forts. But the
; British Government, ae a Government, bus never
s built a fort there. Will it not object to our doing
.it?
Mr. L. then gave vent to something of that ini
dignation with which ho often speaks of the over,
t bearing and grasping apirit of England, and the
y omnipotence and ubiquity of that littlo island. For
y his part, bo did not intend to submit our rights eno
tirely to tho view which she might, in her policy,
11 take of them. He did not intend to stop to consider
" what Mrs. Grundy thinks." Ho would
d go as far as Groat Britain herself went, and then
i* a little fartiior.
d At this moment she is doing, through her IludJ
son Bay Company, all that you wish not to do.
- She is thcro employing tlie same policy and tho
s same medianiam, of a great trading company, by
I. means of which she made her way to the domin;,
ion of all India. Site has already practically
; taken possession of all she ever claimed of ui>,
o southward to the mouth of the Columbia. Her
agents here have directly avowed that she could
i. not give up the establishments which she lias aL
b lowed her people to form there. Her later mca.
b sum, however, are still more decisive of her polis
cy. A branch of her Hudson Bay Company has,
- within a few years, been established in the tcrrito

c flourishing as to have entered into large contracts
: for supplying the Russian possessions with lumber,
i tutter, and such produce. Here is her fixed point,
6 from which she is to work the lever of her looser
i population, spreading itself out over your whole
i territory, and reaching to the very borders of your
i Slates themselves.
Mr. McRoborts considered the provision to
o which the Senators objected as a capital feature
c of the bill. Citizens could not be carried to the
b country without the inducements there held out.
Buttho Senators from South Carolina and Mas.
r sachusctts have considered Great Britain as offer.
!l ing us, in her conduct, an example of scrupulous
f forbearance to do any thing in contravention of
the subsisting treaty. Now, let the Senators con.
r suit the correspondence of Mr. Huskisson, and
i. they will there find that he plainly says that
t Greut Britain bas authorised the settlements which
r have been made, the posts which have been esta.
r Wished, and that both will be protected.
The Senator proceeded to argue, with much
> force, that since tho formation of the convention
f J in which lhi> territory waa looked on as a common
hunting-ground, an entirely different state of
r things had, by our long sapineness, come about.?
. It was a hunting-ground no longer. The game
formerly pursacd thcro for the sake of its furs has
i been, by degrees, almost exterminated; and its
> chase no longer warrants the settlements originally
made for that purpose. Another mode of occupancy,
with other objects, and looking to stations.
1 ry employments, has gradually come about. Tho
' possess on now maintained by tho English is ob.
viously of & fixed character, because its purposes
are no longer hunting and fishing, as of old, when
the convention vas made. If they now occupy
it, it cannot bo for the purposes of the chaee, for
the plain reason that the chase there lias ceased
to be valuable. Yet their settlements are growing,
just in proportion as tho cbaae of the fur animala
declines.
The Senator from South Carolina has given a
' brief view of the several modes of etaim alleged
hv ourselves and Great Britain in rcsrard to this
territory. But let him look, not to the vague allegation*
of right, but to auch claim* u can be
suataincd in the mutual scrutiny of a negotiation.
Now, an to the righta which Britain derives from
Spain, Mr. Honkisaon writes, in 1826, in the negotiation
with Mr. Adams, J'ho rights of B.itain
in that quarter are defined by the treaty of 1790
with Spain and they embrace (ho further aaya)
" every tiling lying north of the place* occupied by
Spain in 1789." Now, it ia perfectly certain that,
at the lime in qucation, Spain had occupied no
point south of Nootka Sound ; which in full throe
hundred rnilcn north of the mouth of the Columbia.
Nor wai it difficult to show that her claim of
discovery wni oqually untenable. Who, upor that
point, enn be n inoro decisive witneaa than Van.
convcr himerlf, the commander whose subordinate,
(Menrf,) in claimed ai the ditrofrrcr." Vancouver,
Reciting, then, the words ot the convention,
j MivJIctR. proceeded W? trgbatbatthey would give
GreaMViU^** raMMt ** ?MBpUU? so foa? as
neither party attempted to dispossess the other.?
irwimM-f aW, hirtnrthio bill; togtf tqfon

fa Uutb| Great Britain has far ten years done ,
all that you now propose to do. Ilitlierto wo ,
hart step* over o?r rights, while sho has hoe* vigi- {
lant and active. Lot notice now be given that wo
renounce the convention of 1?18. It wilt be a
foil twelvemonth before our citizens can get thither
: the Executive will of oourse in the interval
give tbo proper notice to <?rcat Britain.
But, in reality, this bill will embrace every in- .
habitant of the country, whether Uritisli or Amcr.
ican. It can therefore dispossess nobody. Nor,
on the other hand, do titles arise under it before ,
the expiration of Ave years.
As to the enormous display of strength, which
we arc told that sho will make in that quarter, 1
sea no probability of any auch gigantic effort.?
Two facts render it most -unlikely: in the first
place, thcrs is little or nothing there to fight for;
and in the second, we shall have nobody there for
her to fight.
Mr. Henderson, of Mississippi, succeeded Mr.
Mc Roberts, in a short but exceedingly well-argued I
speech, principally on the question of mutual possession
and rights under the convention.
He urged that the act of Great Britain in extending
her jurisdiction over tho country was a
real and practical taking of possession.
Mr. Choate here interposed. Great Britain but
put iu practice by her law her rights over her own
Citizens, and assumed nothing else.
Mr. Henderson resumed. Suppose, then, a case
where one of our citizens commits an ussautt on a
British inhabitant, will he not be seized and tried
before a British magistrate 7 Can you doubt it 7
No, her act of extending her jurisdiction over her
own subjects must either imply the absence of any
such legal equality on our part?in which case
she takes legal control and jurisdiction over our
citizens?-or else it implies that wo too have tribunals
there, asserting our rights of jurisdiction;
which latter state of things is at once a conflict of
jurisdictions, incapable of being reconciled. Forts
wo might exclusively occupy ; but it would be necessary
to beware of going out of them?for whoever
stepped abroad might fall within British juriadiclion
or encounter a British subject.
It was clear tliat tho convention looked to no
such state of things, and provided only for a free
trade of both parties to the territory. The acts of
the Hudson Bay Company must too, be held those
of the British Government. Its possession is Iter
possession. Her sotting up a legal jurisdiction iin.
plies that sho takes possession of the country unless
we do the same. On our taking that step, a con.
flict of jurisdiction ensues, whicl\ must at once
compel the adjustment of our flnal claims of right.
She has asserted her right by these steps of pos.
session. We must do the same; and, by this bill,
we are going no faster than she.
Mr. Bayard here proposed a modified provision
us to grants of laud. But, before any furtlicr pro.
cccding, the Senate adjourned.

(?. W. Terrell, Esq., Atlorncy.Gcncrul
for tho Republic, has written out u long
and lucid opinion upon the validity of the
Cherokee Land Titles. Ho concludes j
that none of tho locations mado upon tho
lands occupied by the Cherokee Indians
subsequent to the dato of the guarantee
made by the Consultation to the Indians
in 1835, are valid and legal ; and con>e.
quently that none made since that date
are logally exempt from survey and sale I
under the act ot' Congress of February
1810.
Much doubt still exists in relation to the
location of the sent of Government. It
may bo regarded ns certain, however, 1
that the Government will not return to I

be, that it will be locuted temporarily1'
