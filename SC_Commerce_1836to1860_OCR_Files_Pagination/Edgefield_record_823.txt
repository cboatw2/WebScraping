'the Senite; as usual, nirnierous me
norials in favor of.the present tariff were
presented and referred..
4 Meiorials were, presented frot: the
Iron Maniufacturers of Pennsylvania and
other places. earnestly protesting against
the passage of the.bill to remit the duty on
imported Rail Road Iron.
rWright presented memorials against
the annexation of Texas.
sAfter the disposalgf private business.
the.Senate resumed the consideration of
the Tariff resolution.
-Mr. Simmons resumed and concluded
his remarks from yesterday, in favor of
the present tariff, and in reply to Mr. Ben
ton.
Tho latter rejoin a. some length, and
.re-asserted his forme views.
In the House, a report was made from
the Committee on Public Buildings, in
favor of using the Drummond Light for il
luminating the Hall for its evening ses
sions. This singular light is produced by
themniting of two jets of oxygen and ni
trogen, upon a piece of unslacked calined
lime, in a state of combustion. Its power
of continuation is equal to any light known.
The projector, Mr. Grant, has invented a
plan with a series of line points, arranged
upon a desk, revolving by clock work,
whereby the ligbt-can be sustained with
out diminution for twelve hours if reqnired.
Amogg the important considerations the
Committee have in view in introducig
the light, is the preservation of the purity
of the atmosphere in the House, which is
now contaminated with the smoke and
flame of lamps, to a degree very injurious
to the health & comfort of members dur
ring the night sessions. In ordinary con
bustion, the oxygen is derived from the
surrounding air. When the air becomes
impure, an excess of carbon, in the form
of smoke, is thrown off. One lamp or
candle in the case, will decompose and
- render unfit for respiration as much air as
four individuals. The Drutmontd light
is free from all these objections, as it pro
vides its own oxygen,
Accompanying the report, was a bill
. making a suitable appropriation for the
necessary apparatus.
Mr. Dromgoole, from the Committee on
Ways and Means, to whom had been ro
ferred the subject of the recent emission of
Treasury Notes, reported a joint resulu
tion, which, declares that said notes, re
cently issued a nominal interest, and pay
able whenever presented at the Treasury
Department, were issued without author
ity of law. The resolution will, I pre
some, depreciate the value of the out
standing notes.
Mr. McKay, from the same Commit
tee, reported a resolution making the
tariff bill the special oder for -the 9th of
Aprit, and every day thereafter, until
finally disposed of. The vote was, yeas
95,"nays 79, which not being two-tltir4a.
as required by the rule, the resolution was
gpectod. He then gave notice that on the
,above day, he will move to go into Com.
mittee of the Whole on the t:ill, As a
majority now.have ponser to go into Com
minee, he will of course succeed.
ir. J. R. Ingersell expressed a hope
that so important a measure would not be
acted upon, until further opportunity to
hear from the people, should have been
afforded.
After the- disposal of numerous unim
portant reports the H~ouse went into Coin
ittee, and resumed the consideration of
the Arrmy Approipriation hill.
The pending question. was still on the
amendixent offered by Mr. Britikeroff pro
viding that after the 20th of July next all
stupernumary officers ot the Armiy shall be
disband'ed.
*A t the terinination of a tedious discus

:'The Committee then took up the bill to

brief speech in which he set forth thie great
importanceof-'such a work to the whole
South.
After 'he disposal of private basiness,
the Post Office Bill of Mr. Met rich was
again taken up.
. Mr. Phelps opposed the bill on the ground
that the proper course would be for the
Department firsf tocut down ibe enormoas
sums paid to Rail Road and other Com
panies for carr3iug the Mail. . All othet
abuses were, he contended, in compari
son with this, but as a mere drop in the
bucket. As for the private mails about
which so much has been said, he knew
they were illegal; but it was nonsense to
suppose they could be put down so long
as public sentiment was against the De
partment. If the latter would purify it
self, there could be nodoubt, but that pub
lie opinion would sustain it. As it was,
however, it was folly to make laws in op
position to public opinion.
The debate was contirbed by Messrs.
Merrick. Dayton, Simmons and others,
till the adjournment, without any question
being taken.
In the House nothing of interest trans
pired. After the adoption of some unim
portant resolutions of inquiry, a number
of bills relating to the local affairs of the
Territories, were debated in Committee
of the Whole.
April 2.
In the Senate, several memorials against
the annexation of Texas were presented
from the Northern States, and referred.
Mr. Tallmadge presented several me
tnorials against any interference with the
tarifflaw.
A resolution was adopted calling on the
Secretary of War, to report on the prac
ticability and probable expense of improv
ing the navigation of the Mississippi river,
at the poin' called the "Chain of Rock."
The bill from the louse making appro
priation for the Military Academy at West
Point, was taken up and passed without
amendment.
The Fortification hill was taken up,
when Mr. Sevier took the floor and com
plained bitterly of the omission of appro
priations for military posts on the Western
frontier. On his motion, the bill was laid
aside, for the purpose of allowing time for
the preparation of amendmdnts.
The Post Office bill was next taken up
and debated until the adjournment with
put any final action thereon. From pre
sent indications. I doubt its success.
In the House, the proceedings were
without interest..
Several resolutions were adopted, call
ing for information from the Department,
and some unimportant report were made.
Mr. I-aralson, from the Military Comu
mittee, made a long report in favor of the
construction of fortifications for the shoals
af Florida.
More than a dozen hills, relating to the
internal affairs of the Territories, were
onsidered in Committee, .reported and
passed.
On motion of Mr. Cave Johnson, a ro
solution was adopted which provides that
all debate in Committee, on the Army Re
trenchment bill, shall cease at 2 o'clock
an Tuesday.
The ab.;ve bill was taken up in Com
mittee and considered during the remain
der of the day. April 3.
In the Senate this morning, a greal
number of Memorials strongly protesting
against the reception of any propositoo
for the annexation of Texas, were presen
ted and referred.
Nmerous Memorial were also present
ed against any change in the Tariff.
Mr. Phelps in the course of some re'
marks on the subject,saidlthat in that in hi!
State (Vermont) there is but one feeling ir
regard to Texas and the Tariff.
On moti',n of Mr. Allen, the Senate re
considered the vote by which 'the WVest
Point Academy Bill w as passed yesterday,
in orer that lie and others who were ac
cidetally absent might record their votes,
The lull wvas then passed by a vote of 29
to 12.
The Fortification bill from the House
w~as tnext considered ast in Committee o
the Whole.
On motion of Mr. Sevier, the bill wva
amended by inserting "for Fort Smith
$30.000; Fort Gibson $15,000, Fort T1ow.
son $6000.."
Mr. Barron then made a speech in whiel
he comnlained that justice has not beet
done to'Loui-inna. lHe therefore mover
to amend by increasing the amount of ap
propriation for that state. lie did no
succeed, however. The bill was theni re
ported and the amendments ordered to hi
engrossd. I do not think they will hb
concurred in by the House.
Mr. Adams, from the Select Committe'
on the Mlassachuzsetts lResolutions, made
minority report. Four othier reports wveri
also made by members of the minority
They wvera laid over till to-miorrow.

1ICE LLAIEOUS!!'
Fromthe Washington Spectaior..
Tix- AND lila tLAY- 7
The Richamond - Whig; if we' recollect
its remarks made about si *eek ago, does
us injustice in sijposing that we intended
to associate Mr. Clay's nane with British
affinities or- any anti.American policy.
We said that --the worst- thing we could
wish our political enerniee,.is. that on the
subjects of Texas and Oregon. they should
take sides with the British," &c., "and
then to crown the whole, let their candi
date for the Presidency. Mr. Clay, .come
out in their support," &c. Here we do
not say we either wih4, or desire, or ex
pect, this state of things to exist; much
less that Mr. Clay will support them.
However erroneous and ruinous to- the
peace of the Union, and the best interests
of the people of the United States, we be
lieve Mir. Clay's intersAl policy in the af
fairs of the Union to be-id 1Hia foreign
policy, and in matters affecting the foreign
interests of the South, few men have been
more faithful and true. On this very sub.
ject of Texas, he was the first and hold
est in his denunciations of the treaty which
alienated her from the Union. He took
the ground in Congress, in his speech in
1820, that the treaty was "imperative."
being contrary to the Constitution, and
the rights of the people of the West. He
afterwards, as Secretary of State, during
Mr. Adam's administration, earnestly en
deavored to recover Texas to the Union.
lie has voted, we believe, since in favor of
every movement in behalf of Texas. We
therefore, would be doing him injustice,
and the cause itself a flagrant injury,
should we class Mr. Clay amongst the op
ponetts to the admission of 'Texas into
the Union. We deprecate the evil of a
divided South on this subject; and there
is but one man who can bring it.- Consis
sistetncy. fidelity to the past. the interests
and honor of the present, al. call on Mr.
Clay to be true to the ancien: lines of the
Union-to his country-to himself. Hi.
friends in Virginia and Kentucky seem to
be wavering. He must not waver.
Neither the times nor the questions before
the country admit of vacillation or equiv
ocation. His bold spirit must know its
place. Thousands and tens of thousands,
who are now in association with the two
great parties of the country, will break
from both when the question of Texas is
fairly placed before them. Interest in the
North-security in the South-the honor
and aspirations of the Union every where
-will carry this question like a whirlwind,
over the land ; and no aspirant to the Pres
idency, we believe, will take position
against it. The man who trtrkles to thr.
foolish and traitorous fanaties of the North
on :his great subject. forgetful, as an A mer
ican, of the pride and high destiny of his
country, and disregardful of the designs of
Great Britain in her insidious encroach
ments and pretensai'ns. will be only fit to
preside over a conventicle of epileptic
Abolitionists, or the more august orgies of
sucrificing the fair danghters of England
-more horrible than the Eastern funeral
pile-to the loathsome embraces of negro
amalgamation. His philanthropic sym
pathies, reeking with such chivalric occu
pations and associations, may then rightly
lead him to belch forth disunion,-or fire the
torch of insurrection itself, to gratify its hu
mane designs.
Can Mr. Clay conso-t with such as
these ? Can he sully that great fame
which, in our foreign affairs, is altogether
A merican, with the foul foam of mad fa
taticism ; or drag it down from the high
gaze of the whole Union, to plunge at
inato the sty of a filthy clique, as despieca
ble as they are wicked and deperate. We
do not believe it-we will not believe it
until it is done. Although opposed to him
oan many points of policy, he is a Southern
mani, full of Southerna characteristics-and
it may he of Southern faults. lie has
more bearts burtaing with personaal attach
ment and admiration for him, thtan any
man in our wide Union ; and those heart
are in the warm South where lucre has
nout won them. Even we, at saneh a en
tastrophe, would bury otar head in out
cloak, and walk sorrowing away, as at
the interment of a revered anad time hont
ored statesmatn, over whom the fresh sod
is closing and closing forever.

After the reception otntinerops private
aid local eportsi Iie :ousiethen'. we i
into Committee'and took; up the bill-re
ceantly reported from the Retrenchment:
Committee to regulate. the pay of officers
of the-Army.The bill proposes to save
half a million of dollars-annually. .
Mr. Davis of Indiana, moved to amend
by. solisling the office of Major General
6f he Army.
"The proposition was opposed: on the
ground that-it would be construed as an
implied censure of General Scott. It was
suggested, however, that a -prospective
law would effect the desired object. The
amendment was finally rejected by a large
acclamative vote.
Numerous other prdyosed amendments
were also rejected.
Mr.- Calhoun arrived this afternoon.
Although he expressly declined a public
welcome, the cordial greeting of his nu
merous friends must have been extremely
gratifying. He received so maiiy hearty
shakes of the hand, that he humorously
expressed his fear of a dislocation of the
shoulder. It is understood that he will
enter upon the duties of his office on Mon.
day, March 30.
The Senateswas not in session*to-day.
In the House, a message was received
from the President, submitting a commu
nication from the French Minister on the
subject of the tonnage duties levied on
French vessels arriving in ports of the
U. S. from the Island of St. Pierre and
Maguelon, and proposing to place our
commercial intercourse with those Is
lands upon tIhesame footing as now exists
with Islands of Malrtinique and Guada
loupe. The President says no reason is
perceived for the discrimination recog
nized by the existing law, and none why
the provisions of the Act of Congress
should not be extended to the Commerce
of the Islands in question.
A communication was also received
from the P. M. General in answer to a
resolution relative to private mails. He
says that owing to the illegal proceedings
o persons in many parts of the Union
carrying mail matter by.privete mails,
the revenue of the Department, will not
meet the current expenses for the present
year by $200,000, notwithstanding the ut
most economy has been pursued. Owing
to this he has been compelled to deny
mnail facilities, where he was satisfied the
wants of the public demanded them.
A communication was likewise received
frot the War Dehartment, in answer to a
resolution relative to the ordering to his
post of Lieut. Bragg, before his term of
leave of absence had expired. The Sec.
retary says, that in the order for the re
turn of Bragg, it was expressly provided
that It was not to take effect in case he
should be under the summons of a Com
mittee.
A second letter Was received from the
P. M. General in which he states that the
estimate for the Mail service for the fiscal
year commencing July 1, 1844, are $4,
i30,000.
By a letter from the Navy Department,
it appears thattbe number of native sea
men registered during the past year, was
as follows: Maine, 848; New Hampshire
98 ; Mass. 3167; Rhode Island 266; Conn.
149; New York 1106; Penn. 464; Dela
ware 23; Maryland 270; Dist. of Colum
bia 60; Virginia 260; North Carolina 298;
Georgia 21; Florida 37. Total $,084.
The number of naturalized seamen re
gistered during the same period was 92.
Some onimportant busitness having been
disposed of, the House wetnt into Cotmmit
tee und resumed the conbideration of the
hill to regulate the pay of officers of the
Army.
Several proposed amendments were
rejected, after whieb Mir. Petit, of Itndiana,
raised a real storm by moving to strike out
the pay for Chaplains of the Army. He
argued that the genius of our institutions
does not warrant the employment of such
functionaries.
' alr. H~olmnes. in a burst of indignantel
oquence, dlenounced the proposition as
unworthy the consideration of Congress.
le referred to history for instances with
out number, where a recognition of the
Deit y had crowned armies with success.
He expressed a fervent hope that no one
would be found to defend such an amend
ment.
M1r.- J. R. Ingersoll followved. on the
same side. The debate, wvhich had now
assumned an exciting character, was con
tinued by Mlessrs. Petit, Harden and
Wentworth. Finally on the appeal of
r. Steenrod, the atmendment was with
drawn. 3
After the rejection of several other
amendments the Committee rose and the
H ouse adjourned.

To-day the city was enlivened by a
grand procession of the members of the,

MEXICO-TEXIAN PRISONERS.
We yesterday had an interview with
two of the Mier prisoners, who have rei
cently been liberated from their captivity
in Mexico through the intervention of Mr.
Bankhead, the new;British Minister.
The gentleman liberated are Maj. T. W.
Murray and Mr. Donald Smith. They
reached this city last evening by the sehr.
John Barr, just arrived from Vera Cruz.
When they left the latter cite it was
reported and generally -believed that all
the San Antonis prisoners had been re
leased, or soon would be; and in some
quarters sanguitie expectations were en
tertained that all the Texan prisoners cow
in Mexico would soon he act al large.
We h-arn further, that since the 11th of
September last, there have been twenty
two deaths at the Castle of Perote.
By this arrival we have received no
papers nor scarcely a word of verbal in
telligence. The Barr made the passage
in three and a half days. The Laura Vir
ginia sailed) on the day previous with pa
pers. and by her we shall probably receive
our files. The U. S. brig Bainbridge, said
io be awaititg the arrival of Gen. Waddy
Thompson, was to sail for Pensacola on
the 27th inst. The U. S. brig Somers
%ailed for Pensacola on the 22d.-N. 0.
Pica3une, March 30.
An indian Murdered tn Jail.-We learn
from the Miner's Express, of Dubuque,
Iowa, that the two Winnebago Indians
confined there to awtit their death for the
murder of white meo, quarrelled on the 2d
instant, when the stronger killed the wea
ker. As near as can be gathered from the
imperfect English of the tall Indian, it ap
pears that the small one reproached him
with having killed a Che-moko-man, (a
white man,) that the Great Council had
decreed that he should (lie, and taunted
him with heinig the cause of their misfor
tne, (alluding to the murders.) This so
enrajged his comarade, that he caught up a
stick of wood and dealt him the fatal
blows. The tall Indian throughout the
itnvestigation of the Coroner's Inquest pre
served the most stoical indifference, and
gazed about with a vacant stare of curiosi
ty, and never exhibited the slightest re
morse of conscience. Upon being ques
tioned about the quarrel he replied, '-Vhis
key-Che-mo-ko, tme nego!' pointing to

Another Prophet.-A rival to Father
Miller, stays the New Orleans Bee has ap
pearedl in this ciiy. The new prophet is
named Leonard Jotnes, and formerly s
tabtished a sect in Kentucky called .Live
Forever!-a term significant of the creed
of his people, who wore to etijoy bodily
existence and perennial yonth upon this
time wa-sting world, through the renova
ting influence of faith. One of their
preachers having dlied, the sect was bro
Iken up. He has since imbibed a new phi
lanthrophy, in the shape of a direct reve
elation, which was mtade to hint in the
neighiborhood of Daniville. Ky., on or about
the 14th of March last. Hlenow preaches
that the world is coming to an end only so
far as Satan is concerned-that the Devil
is to be put dlown and his works disap
pear -a most consoling belief.
The Famnilyi of Smiths -A writer in
the Norfolk Beacon tells of a town in
Texas which he visited, where out of a
population of 400, the Smiths numbered
300. The postmaster, the collector, the
broker, the colonel of the militia, the act
inig magistrate. the candidaie for Congress,
the cashier of the bank, the principal
muerhianit, all bore the unicomnmon name
of John Smith ! He adds, rather dubi
ously, that "what were the names of sotme
of thegr in the States it would he hard to
tell !"

The one on Moniday evening was 'a re

good cause. The Methodist Church was
filled by a very attentive and apparently
highly interested and -gratified auditory.
Judge O'Neal, the noble and generous
leader of that cause i9 South Carolina, ad
vocated it for about an hour in a speech
replete with interesting anecdote..correct
and manly sentiment, and able argument.
He ran over the subject with .masterly
power, depicting in glowing terms the po
sition of the drunkard, and the disgust meD
ar- compelled to feel at the meanness 'of
his ways and the loathsomeness of' his
habits. The draw-drinker's plea, that he'
uses liquor as a stimulant to appetite, was
next taken from him; and the gentleman
who likes to sip his wvine at the social
board, was admonished of the dangus
ground on which he treads. The 'yonug
men, the hope and promise qf the country,
were entreated, assa fatherdoth his 'son;
and we think here.is remnarks were pe
culiarly happy and ipessaVe, coming as
it did from such a source. He also intro
duced some memorials handed to him by
the venerable Judge Gannt, now in his
77th year, who had, after maturely con-'

intemperance." lie stated how' halo and
