this reciprocal esteem and friendship of the

union as a rope of sand. What are bonds,
agreements, and treaties between individuals,
communities and powers, without thai
mutual good will, that reciprocal effort an<J
zeal necessary to fulfilment, to consummation
in joint labors and undertakings, or in
ssociations for mutual felicity? What are
they? Nothing. All experience,all history,
all past time has proved so. Wi'h

j the British provinces from our territory. I
! Taese meetings were justly haded as e\i ;
dcnce of returning sanity and regard lor i
our national character and obliga ions on *
that frontier. We regret to perceive 01;
oilier- hand, in tliu published pro- j
cccdings of incetin:s of nn opposite j
1 character, held here and there proofs of,
; unsoundness in public opinion to such an |
i extent as to be inconccivcablc, if wo had ;
not the evidence of : before our ryes. At;
j a Public Meeting, for example held at Cleve-,
I land, Ohio, on the 29th of last month, we
J find, among sundry resolutions adopted the
following:
MResolved, Thtit whenever n Govemmcn'
adjoin'iig to the Uni'ed States shall
:rcaf a> criminals respectable citizens for
attempting to introduce the principles of.
equal lights and self-government into their ,
country, the cruelty exercised towards them ,
is an insult to our Government, for which j
our Government should hold them rc. j
j sponsible."

i teld by Walter Scott) presided over certain
I o'li'jay freaks in the old country, in wh:ch
every thing was wont to bo turned upside ;
down or inside out hod presided at t! c meetj
ing to which we refer, it is impossible to .
J concciy 5 that any proposition could have ,
I been adopted more contrary to common J
{ sense, common honesty or common law,!
than is contained in the above resolution,;
j keeping in view the ground upon which it is j
' bassed. In the first place, the outlaws who
/ havo banded together there to violate the j
| most solemn laws of their own country are ;
j described as "respectable citizens." Tfvn j
their invasion of a friendly territory wiih '
fire and sword, murdering harmless people j
a d ravaging their property, is ha'toured :
into "attempting to introduce the principles
of equal rights and self.govenmcnt" i
into that territory : and finally, the punish. ;
mem of t iese pirates, whose hands are !
| reeking red with the innocent blood they j
have murderously spilled, is "an insult to '
1 our Government;" as though this Govern-j
. m?ni (i o work of the wisdom of the Revo- i

exci:ed feelings of the highest admiration.

The toast having been drunk with the
; ancient honors, Mr. Maxcy rose and said :
" Gentlemen, I have not language to ex.
j preset he emotions to which the exhibition of;

which arises from common laws, for, gentlemen,

In 991, the winter lasted very long, and
i was extremely severe. Every thing was
i frozen, and famine and pestdence closed the
1 vi?nr.
! In 1037, the cold wns so intense that j
I most of the travellers in Germany were fro,

: by the frost with an immense noise.
In 1216, the river Po froze to the depth
i of 15 ells, and wine also burst the casks.
In 1234, a pine forest was killed by the
frost at Ravenna.
In 1236, the frost was most intense in
Scotland and the Categat was frozen between
Norway and Jutland.
In 1232, the houses in Austria were buried
with snow.
' In 1292, the Rhine was frozen, and in

clear the way for the Austrian army.
j In 1344, all the rivers in Italy were fro|

In 1594, the winter was so severe that

In 1468, the winter was so severe in

In 1670, the frost was very intense in
England and Denmark, both the Little and

In 1684, many forest trees, and even the
oaks in England were split with the frost,

" The murder appears to have boon cornmi

! On fits return, about three hundred yards
: from his house, he was a:tacked and murdered
by two of his young fellows, who
were lying in wail for him- They called
a negro (Dick) to bring his horse to the
gate, and then carried the body a quarter
of a mile up the road, and above the house.
They put the right foot in the left stirrup
and then frightened the horse, which MD
1 about forty yards before the stirrup broke
! The body was found about 8 o'clock
I next morning, with the stirrup on the

ing dragged the distance I have men.

This very circumstance proved the
murder instead of an acci ental death. A
puudlo of blood was found where the Gen.
rral was killed, covered. All the wounds
wereiuflicted on his head, and appear to
have been made by six blows with a hard,
heavy slick. The skull was fractured in
two placs. Eight of the nesroes are now
in jail. Three are supposed, from the cirs

all that is possible."
The insurrection in Mexico.?A letter |
from Houston, (Texas) to the Editor of the i
New Orleans Bulletin and published in tint
paper says:?"I enclose the substance of
a let cr just received by Expres from the
Mexican Eastern frontier, deemed of great
consequence. The boat could not wait for J
a full translation, so 1 send you the follow. I

Comargo and Reynosas, on the Grande,

The central troops have been driven
out of the above mentioned towns. The
commander of the Federalists, (Canales,)
at the head ofihe 3d division in that district,
requests the Government of Texas to adopt

informed that Gen. Henderson, the Texian
Representative near the French Government,
has closed a commercial arrangement,
whereby the ports of Texas and France are
opened to the vessels and products of each
other. We announced that such a negotiation
was on foot some weeks since, which
is now confirmed from an anthentic source.
This fact may bo considered as a very favorable
indication of the policy and views
of France as regards our new sister Republie,
and followingthe example of Great Britain,
(who entered into a similar arrangement
some time since,) it may be considered
as furnishing good evidence of a speedy and
more formal recognition of the indepondence
of Texas, on the part of both England
and France. Texas wi'l not then want the i

etter was addressed to Governor Ritner by
Mr. Bidule, President of the United States

vania. and her connexion with the Western
States, and they have inrruct *d me to offer
to you, without delay, every assistance with*
in their power to remedy this misfor.une. If
you have any author'uy to borrow, they will
lend to you under that authority, or they
will lend to you withoutony, relying on the
spit it of the Legislature of Pennsylvania to
provido for advances made in a time of
need to protect her interest. You are ac*
cordingly at liberty to call upon this bank
for any amount which you mav consider
necessary for the immediate and ample w
pair of the public works on the Juniattt.
With great respect, yours,

[This ofler was accepted by Governor
Ritner, and about $300,000 were drawn
from the bank for these repairs.]

3,000 hands having been kept constantly
employed upon it. The line of tha Canal
from Dam No. 5 (eight miles above Will*

plcied that the water will be admited into
