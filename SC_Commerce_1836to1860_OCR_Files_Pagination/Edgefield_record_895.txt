POLITICAL.
The followitg is the substance of the
remarks of Mr. McDuffie on the bill to-re
duce the rates of postage, &c.
Mr. McDuffie, after a feiv remarks,'in
distinctly heard, said he regarded ~it as his
solemn duty not only to record his vote,
but to protest against this m'ea'sre.. ft
was-in vain to disguise Its ultimate effe'e,
whatever might be itI object. 'He took it
for granted and could- safely say, that
whatever ingenious speculations had been
heard upnu this subject in sypport of a low
rate of postage as producing a large in
crease of correspondence, it was very dif
ferent from the theory which prevailed
with the some Senators upon.anoiher sub
ject, (the Tariff.) le flattered himseff
that tler6 was tit a .Senator here who
ehlly believed that the post office estab
lishment could be maintained under the
operation of this law,-without being annu
ally thiown upon the national treasury to
the amount'ofat least from one to two mil
ie's of dollars. lie would not discuss
it as a que-stion of maintaining the existina
system under such modifications as would
mitigate the burdens of the community,
without destroying the revenue of the de
partment. But he should disus it as a
measure which would throw this depart
ment ultimately upon the national treasury
for its support. Insignificant as it might
appear to some, in this respect, lie regar
ded it as one of the most radical and revo
lutionary movemnts in our finnicial sys
tein, ever attem.ted in the United States.
Aud what was the pretext-what was the
ingenious disguise under which gentlemen
iad presened this question to the Senate ?
To relieve the people from their hurdens
-the burdens of postage. He would ven
- ure to say that, of all the burdens impo
sed on the people by ttiq government, this
was one of the least felt, and the least
complained of. But how-viewing this
as a question of paying the expenses of
the department out of its own income, or
paying them out'of the treasury-h'ow was
it to relieve the people ? You relievo a
citizen from paying postage, and then col
lect the money from him to pay into the
treasury, to indemnify the government
from loss. What a delusion ? If the
amount saved to the person by this reduc
tion of duty be equal, fully equal, to the
tax which he pays to the government, in
order to enable it to defray these expen
ses, he receives no benefr. What was the
benefit of taxing a man to pay money into
the treasury, in order to exempt him from
paying postage? What did he gain ?
What could any body gain by stch a poli
cy as this ? It was obvinus that if the ben
efit of this reduction were to accrue to the
same individual who paid the money into
the treasury, he could not gain by the re
duction; but if the individual who was thus
benefitted was not the person who paid
the money into the treasury, then it was
unjust. You give the officers of the gov
crument the benefit of the profitable agen
cy of collecthig money, and paying it into
the treasury, that it may be paid out again
to the persons that it was collected from in
another shape, but curtailed by all tie ex
aIvcVo fiTiisiijectwfidlistriii
him most forcibly was, that. contenplating
the efflects as they naturally were, this bill
was intended to exem Pt ote larger class of
-. the comm unity from the burden of postage,
and to suhjeel another class to the burden
of taxation in order to effect this reduction.
lHe did not know the existing condition
of things in the WVest. lie presumed that
they were very similar to what they were
in the South ; but he knew this-that his
constituents, so fur from regarding their
postage as a burden to be comnplainedl of,
regarded it as alnost the only benefit they
received from the financial or genteral ope
rationas of this governmet.
In the whole region of the WVest and
* South the population was comparatively
sparse; and in those thintly populated por
tions of the country the distribution of itn
telligetnce was a matter of vast imiportarice.;
Hie thought the Senate had heard some
thing in the early stage of this debate,
.about the intpartance of catrr-natang
information and intelligence to the people
of the Ujnnited States. The greater pfah'
of the corresponideoce in this country wsas
carried on by the commnercial atnd manu
facturing comnmuntity. All the agricitlt t
rat portions of the Utnited States were made
tip, particularly in the South and South
west, of a population who wrote very few
letters, anrd re-eeived v'ery few. Ile could
not imagine an agriculturist who would
feel the burden of postage at all-even if
doutbled; and he believed he had not a
constituent who did not pay a larger dtuty
tupon the salt which he used atnually than
upon his postage. lie spoke of the agri
cultural portion. Amongst these were the
cotton planters; and he would venture to
say, speaking for himself, that if lie were
to pay the postage directly upon every let
?er which he received annually, the duty
that lie paid upon his cotton bags would
be one hundred times greater than his pos
tage.
Now, were the people to be taxed on
the first year of ibis experiment two miu
tior~s, and then four mtillions; and, in the
course of fifteen years from thir time, ten
muillions of dollars thrown upon the public
treasury, to increase the favors conferred,
nnd swell the magnitude of that oppressive
burden wvhich was niow thrown upon the
agricultural portion of the community, for
* the suppport of thte maniufacturers of the
norih ? WVas this to be thrown ttpon the
people nowv to relieve those manufacturers
of their postage ?
That wvasr-he whole matter. The man
ttfacturing and- commercial portions of the
Union were the' portions alone that had
raised this agitatior about lowv rates of
postage. it was-with them the excitement
had originated, and it had been very in
geniously distributed throughout the coun
try. Every farmer had to pay, for the
clothes- he swore, and for the articles he
* ~ consumed in his family, fifty times as
utch into the federal treasury, out of which
that money came- to support these mano
facturers, to'be paid for postage. But that
the farmer regarsled as do burden at all.
It was no burde. to him to pay once or
twice a week twelve and a half or twenty
five cents postage on a letter; anid yet he
felt it more thant the $15 or $20 he pays
to his (Mr. McD's) friend from Rhode Is
landA Mr. Rimmans, for his calicoes.
Eis objection, then, to this hill and the
measure which it proposed was, that it
would certainly throw the Post Office De
pirtment, or the larger portion of tfs ex
Oienditures, upon the Trehsury Depart
ment. He knew of no reason why the
postage should be reduced below'ten cents,
that would inot apply 'to aboli'sig it alto
geth'er. -Why has any rate at all if it was
not adqquate to the ex-pe'nbls 'of rhe de.
'ph rtiridnt 1
He 'had shown ithat the effect of this bil
would be to throw the burden upon those
wlio ought rot to pny it, in order to relieve
those who, upon every principle of'humar
justice, ou'ght to pay it., This had beer
very generally regarded as a question o
taxation. When a 'manpn'id so tnuch into
the post office for a letter, it was supposed
he was paying it as a tax to the govern.
rient. Now this was no such thing. He
(Mr. McD.) no more paid a tax when he
paid the federal go'vernment twenty-five
cents to enable him to transport a lettei
cheaper than he could get it Irattsported
by a private company, than he paid a ta:
to a wagoner or boatman to carry his cot
ton. It was not paying a tax, liut paying
for services which the government had
rendered hiin, atnd which nobody else
could perform upon terms which suited
him so well. Suppose you make private
contracts for the transportation of your cor
respondence ; it would cost besides the in
convenience of having no system at all.
three times as much as you pay the gov
ernmieut.
This must be regarded n a general sys
tem-not a -system our the benefit of one
portion of the Union, but for all. And he
would ask, if we vere to regard it as a tax,
could the imagination of tman conceive a
more just tax thtan that which levies the
burden upon the person who seceives the
benefit ? Who ought to pay the postage ?
Thai iwas the whofe ialter. The poor

and who paid ten dollars to the govern
mncut in the forn of a duty on sugar, salt,
or iron ? Ought he to pay his (Mr. Mc
Duifflie's) letter postage? Ought lie to
pay the let :er postage of the Sentor from
Rhode Island ? No: they ought to pay
their own postage. Let him tell gentle
inen that the whole arr ount ofthis systetm
would consist in relieving the nannfar
turing portion of the corrmunityi and the
densely populated parts of the country.
from their postage, and to throw the hur
:den upon the agricultural, or sparsely
settled portion of the United States. Now,
lie would respectfully suggest that it would
be just as reasonable-and he did not
know that it would not come to pass-that
the manufactures in the North, who had
a vdst deal of correspondence in their bu
siness. should ask first, that we should en
able them to keep up their establishments
by the enormous duties of a protective
system. 6tid then that we should raise
funds to pay for the trinsportatiin of their
manufactures frim Boston to New Ytork,
New Orleans, &c. They had just as much
iaht to come and call upon th lipeople of
he South and Southwest to do that, as to
call upon then to pay for the transporta
tion of their letters. Now ihe people of
ishment; but he was not willing to see a
measure passed which would break Up
one half of the post offices throughout the
ontry. Under these views of the sub
et, he ptotested against this as a system
ending to produce a revolution in this de
patmetnt grossly unjttst in the distribution
f the burdetis of this ground. It was
aying the foundation, in the post office de
aisnent, of a system of corruption, the
xtent of whtich no human sagacity eould
nticipate. Already it was hawfuil foi- the
end of that departtment to exercise the lar
est control over 'he public opiuion of the
otrty of any oficer uender the gos etrn

haracter for integrity and honesty, that lie
nede those postmasters who lhad dealings

roaching almost to idolatry. No man itn
the United States had the power to exer
cise a greater influence than the head of

yet it wasa discretionary power ; atid ev
ery Postmaster General would have the
neatns of doing a favor to atny deputy post
naster, or any numtber of deputy postmas

Upon the whole, he regarded this sys

roduce the most disastrous consequences.
