CHI LDIHOOD.
Childhood is like the laughing hours
Of early spring
The very cloud that o'er it lours
A charm can bring;
For, like an April sky,
A shower, a sunny ray,
Ho the bright tear in childhood's eye
A smile can chase away.
But even whilst we gazo
Those early days are gone,
And soon the glowing rays
Of sunitner hasten on:
The bud hath opened to tho flower,
The boy to manhood sprung,
And front his heart sin's hardening power,
Its bitterness hath wruing,
Ile dreans that he can win from fatme
An honored deathless name;
And by following glory's banner bright,
He finds an early grave;
But memory ensbrouds in night
The last hope of the brave.
Io is forgotten-o'er his bier
No nation's tears are shed;
Nought, save a widowed mother's tear,
Laments the hero lead.
The poet strikes his lute
Sweet thrill its golden strings;
But public praise is mute
His lay no rapture brings.
And mournfully his heart,
Echoes its tender utne,
Vis airy dreams depart.
His hope of fame has flown.
Like an expanded flmwer,
Whose leaves fall one by one,
Ilope fades 'neath disappointments power,
'Till manhood's prime is gone.
And age, like autumn, chill and sear,
Scaters each lading lenf,
'Till not one flower remains to checer
The path of life sosadly.drear,
And vet so brief
'Till all the weary heart would cravo
1s but a rest from woes
The coming winter of the grave
Its snow around him throws
Anti ove'ihli, froyoutha io age.
lan treads his weary pilgrimage.
Miscellaneous.
In an old book of "New Travels in the
United States of America, performed by J.
P Brissot do Warville," is the followiing
immlfedliate'ly inlteres5tin~, patssneC Ont steam
navigation. Mr. Rtumsey whom he mien
tioins, was a remarkable genius, and a pro
phet of undoubted sagacity.
PHILADELPItI A. Sept. I, ly79.
I breakfasted with Samuuel Ameland,
rF miletn] one of tihe richtest andI most bene.
liciemi of the Society of Friendts. ie is a
pupil of Anthmony llenetzet; he speatks
hin with ent htsiasm~and treads in his steps
He tatkes an active parrt every useful iin
etituttion, anid rejoices in the occaesion of
doing good; ho loves the French nation tem;
speaks thoir language. lie treats mae wit,
the greamet rriendship; oer mec his hittuse
his htorses. and his carriage. On leatvin-!z
him, I wvent to see an experiment near the.
Delatware, on a hoar, the object of which is
to ascend rivers aruintst the enrrent. The
inventor wvas Mr. IFitch. wyho hatd found a
compani~ty to support ithe exptenise. One of
the motist zealou~ts a1ssocittes is Mir. Thuornton
- of whoum I have spoken, Th'is inventiotn
wvas disputed betwveen Mur. Fitch, and Mr.
tntmsey of Virginita. Ilowever, it ho. the
machine w~hich I saw, appears well execiu
ted and~ well ndapted ton the design. The
steam engine gives mifol jto . three lamrge'
oars ofeconsiderable force which were to give
60. strokes per mnintute.
"I doubt not bitt. phtysically speaking,
this tmaichinte may prodluce panr toft he. etliects
wyhich were exp1)e'-dt fromut it; bmut I doutbt
its utility itn commteree; four tnot withsrandiing
ing the assturatners of~ the tundersakiers,
it mustt require matny mten to mnaag e it.
and tuch expense in repairing the datm
nges occasioned by the m'mltiplicity of
the friction. Yet I will allow that if the
rnovemnen-s can he simptlifiedt, andit the ex
penuses lessened, the invention may bn uise
til in a counttry w.hero lambor is decar, amnd
wvhere the bordners of rivers arc nor acceessi
tble, like those in France, by horses to mlrow
the hoats, This iea was contsolint to Dr.
*Thornton, whomu 1 sawv atssailedn by railer
zes on a-:eonnt of the steantmoat. 'lThese
raileries appear to tne very ill plaicedn. 'rThe
obstacles to be conqiuredl by genius tre
cver'y where so cottsiderable, the eneotur
agemnent so feeble,a:nd the nece'ssity of sup
pmy. t the wtmnt of handlatbor so evident,

"Since writing tii letter, I htave. seen

great inuaennity ; and bmy thme explanation
which ho has given me', it appetars that his
discovery, though ftiundedl ont a similatr prin.
