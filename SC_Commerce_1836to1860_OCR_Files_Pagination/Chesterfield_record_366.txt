I would sow broad cast rye, and lot rny cattle

spring and summer I let it rest, and that fall,
out; and the next year I planted corn, and

of July and August, (for I always Jay by
corn by the 4th of July,) I would cover not
only that part of rny corn which I hud ma- j

1823. They ore remarkable f?>r quantity
of wool and ihrifines?, and crossed slightly
with the Merino are much improved both

They ?re not so beau ii'ul and full shaped
as the Sou h Down or B ikewcll, nor so
large as the latter, hut for all the purposes
of domest ic use, I think arc preferable to
anv variety tve have. From a Ram I got j
in Virginia, I hatj yearly a el'p of from 9 to ;
12 lbs. of unwashed wool. A flock off
these in good order, with a large propor- j
lion of wethers from 4 to 6 years old, would j
yield on an average with us from 0 to 9 j
lbs. of wool.
The fine Merino has gone out with us- - j
they are too small and their wool too fine ;
for domestic use : the African having hav- !
ing coarse and long wool?is just the thing j
for our plantation operatives, and it is for i
this reason 1 have adhered tothem as much'
ns possible, notwithstanding the strong ,
temptation before me, in the beautiful Sheep
of my neighbor, Col. Hampton.
The cross he has of the South Down and
B ikewell, or Leicester, constitute the very I
perfection of the animal, to my eye, so fur as

solitary objection of the short wool and not
enough of if. This objection, however, is ,
one which is seldom urgt<J and rarely regarded,

Extract from a Trad, by Dr. Wm. A.
r Alcott.
After explaining and illustrating the ruinnous
eff ete of tight lacing on personal
comfort, beauty, and health, the author inquires
whether any thing con be done toi
arrest the further progress of the evil, and !
if so, what can be done 1 la answer to the |
inquiry he snys?

And herein, .perhaps, is tho most difficult
part of all. It is comparatively ea<y for
mothers and teachers to tell their children
and pupils how they ought to do; but to
what will their good advice amount, if they
do not set a corresponding example ? And
yet there are many who say?perhaps in
sincerity, too,such is the warping, debilialing
effect of any sort of slavery on the ,
\l mind?as others have said of spirits, tobac. \
<o, opium, snuff, tea, coffee, <kc., that they
havo used the unnatural and unnecessary
support ?o long, that however wrong in the
nature of things its use may be, they cannot,
themselves, do without it.
Let mothers and teachers?we speak of
those who are truly enlightened?do as they,
may in regard to setting an example, they
must, as Christians?is any thing, indeed
but ihe murderers of their children?train
. up their families to freedom of body as well
us to freedom of mjnd. It is difficult for us
to think, with *any good degree of complacency;
of the mother who, while nhe under
stands this subject, will still bring up her
children to the use of a tight dress. tl
Few persons can be found who admi nr
that I hey themselves dress tightly enough to w
do any harm. 0;hers do, they will admit, w
and they themselves may have done so in o
former years ; but of lute they dress loosely,
wry loosely indeed. And they probably d
think so. Yet we have known persons e
entertain this notion, who never, in their b
lives, put on a dress by their own unaiJed p
efforts. It required the main strength of n
one or two strong female assistants. Such v
is the power of habit, and the infatuation of v
slavery. I
There are not a few good people, however,
who are wanting in the moral courage no- ti
cessary to reform*'ion. They would gladly v
change their habits, they say, and dress cor- v
recly ; but then how would"they look / t
They dare not, for their lives, be thus singul. c
jar. Wo p ty those who make this objection i
I to changing their habits, for wo know they c
j ate sorely tried. Nevertheless, as surly
! as we ought to obey God ntther than man. t
I so surely is it our duty to go forward and 1
; do what we believe to be our duty, all np e
! pen ranees to the con'rary notwithstanding, t
Pf??ss.maker3 may, and in our opinion <
j ought to do something in this matter. Let
j it b? remember *(J, we say once more, thr
| we spe ik of those who understand the he- 1
j man constito i m and its laws, and tlie t< rj
riole evils of tight.lacing, and who acknowli
edge titc force of moral obligation; for we
i havo little if nr.y hope of others. Tltedres*j
maker might do a very great work ind? <d,
; if sic would. There is a wi le difference
| between persuading every fern do who has
?' a - new dress, to have it as loose as possible.

has sometimes been done?in ordf'r to in. J

; What if it will not sit quite so well?what
th ?n.? She might s'ate the case plainly, (
> placing her own heal h and her da y to Iter t
' race into one end of the scales, and a per- j
! verted taste and tyrannical fashion into the j
(other, and leave her to deide for liers?df .
i w!iat she should do. But 1 ss tha- this, as
i it appears to up, the truly Christian dress
' maker cannot do. She has no right o he
voluntarily an instrument iu destroying her
fellow creatures, to secure to hers?if ?li"
reputation of being considered accomplished
in her profession.
This, wcare aware is requ'ring of a single
occupation more ihan will bo readily '
granted. \\ liy, it will be asked, shall th'? 1
dress.maker sacrifice her own pepuniary in.
terest in this y, morwa thean persons of other
occupations? But we have nor said 1
said that she should. We would require
Christmas of evrry occupation?the B b!?requires,
it, and how can they do less ??to i
put duty in the foreground, and sell-interest |
| in the shade. I
Not that wc are ignorant, wholly so, of j
the difficulties which dress.makers have to [
encounter in the progress of these labors, j
j Tliey have not only to meet their own con|
victions of duty, but also the prejudices of ,
i their customers.
1 ^ #
i A conscientious dress-maker once said t
to a voung lady, a factory girl?" You dress '
too tightly ; your waist is very small indeed* *
" It is much larger than I wish it was," she
; replied, very pcrilv. What con a dress
maker do unJersuch circumstances ? Nev. 1
erlheless, it is her duty to do all she can ; '
and the difficulties which she has to ericoun- r
ter only ineienso her obligations.
We have already, said that in our own
opinion it behoves all who have it in their I
power, to cry aloud and spare not, through I
the medium of the press. But we may do ,
do something in various ways, both single .
" handed and associated. Mothers may do 1
much. Teachers of our various grades of 1
of schools m ay do much. Physicians may \
j do much. And we also conceive that min. (
I isters of the gospel may do much ; if not
I by their preaching, at leost by their conversation.
Nay more ; every individual may }
\ do much?especially every influential indi. \
vi iual?and who is not influential ? Does
' not every person, from the highest to the t
lowest, have his share of influence ? Who .
is thcro to be found that is not looking at
the example of somebody else in these, os
W 'll as ali other matters ? It seems to us s
that the influence of example, as a means 1
of instruction?especially the example of 1
tho^e individuals to whom the com nunity
are accustomed to look up?has never as i
yet been sufficiently understood.
*We have alluded to ministers, and haz- c
arded the opinion, that much might be done c
to effect a reformation in regard to dress, j
by their agency and influence. We think j
that their efforts would be greatly aided by r
the example of their families. Such efforts i
and such examples, very iortunutcdy, are p
not wanting. We have of late come in fi
contact with several. More than this ; our e
ministers are beginning to suggest plans for 0
the reformation of others. It may not be *
amiss to present one very plausible plan, j,
suggested by a minister of tho gospel in this g
state, in a letter of very recent date. He t
first endeavors to show that mankind ore
governed by passion much more than by t
reason ; and secondly that on this account
it is almost useless to talk, write lecture, &c., <
longer on the snbject of a reform in ^
dress, till some definite plan of action is b
adopted. He then proceeds as follows . r
"The human family are governed as much s
by passion us by reason. As long as it is 0
fashionable to dress tight not more than
one in a hundred of our young ladies will J
have reason, and principle and indepen. c
dence enough to dress as they ought. To
be nut of the fashion, is to them like being ti
out of the world. Shall we then accomplish w
much until we make some definite move, h
ment to change the fashion ? This wa? n
our first efficient effort in the cause of tern- J
+ b
perance. c
" Suppose, then, that an attempt be madp, fc
definitely, to introduce a new fashion. Let &
a few ladies of taste, judgement and principle,
unite to devise a fashion of a dress suited to
the frame and constitution of woman. A 01
little counsel from one hke yourself, who is ^
familiar w ith the structure of the houset
might bo very beneficial. to
L ,l&
*
44 So far as appearance is concerned, any ?:
jing which is fashionable looks well to the C(
mltitude ; but still, a fashion which is made ?
nth reference to health and character, g
ould have greatly the advantage in a virtu- j
us community. . tt
44 Lot us. then, try to get a fashion well- c
eviscd% and then lot the effort b? made to ti
nlist votaries. Lei the fiends of reform e
egin by example, with resolu'ion and.inde/ (
endenre to carry it through, and miglr we ?
tot hope to carry the thing so far in a li.tle f,
kiiile, that nu adherence to n bad fishion t
I'ould be considered rather as a token of ti
i id morals ?" t
Whether the particular plan here sugges- a
ed shall or shall not be hereafter adopted,
ve do ardently hope the friends of reform
viH keep the sul>jcct of dress in agitation
ill something is done. M e hope mosi ?rlendy?r.ay,
we believe?it w II not he per.
nitted to rest till the human body?is re1
e ned from it- degradation. J
We have alluded in a proceeding page, to 5
he saying of a mtn*h esteemed individual, v
ately deceased,* that if the present fashions, f
;speeia!ly as regards tress, are to continue,
he present race will be extinguished in two

The petitions sent to Crongre39 for laving a
luty on imported silks, now admitted free, and
he favor ehnwn to these petitions in the Sen. s
ite, by Messrs. Clay and Buchanan, are now
iltrcting considerable attention in France.?
\11 the leading newspapers have taken up the
lubject. The Journal des Debats says;
It is seriously agitated at Washington to
mpose upon silks a duty of twenty per cent,
?that is to say, the maximum of the Ameri.
:an tariff?from the 1st of July; 1842. In the
ourse of last January, Mr. Clay presented peitions
to that e J, and recommended them to
he Senate. More recently ano'her Senator,Mr.
Juchanan, advocated the same measure, with
eference to the interests of the Treasury.?
rhis consideration, it is to be feared, will be
owerful with Congress, by reas< n of the deficit
in the Federal finances?adeficit inconsidrable,
indeed, and easly to be supplied by the
ild residuary funds, but there must be prepara.
ion for extraordinary demands. Under all
ircumstances, the project of the duty on silks
r a strong temptation ; it w uld yield a large
urn. This subject eminently claims the atlenion
oJ?ihe French Government.
he Temps (now a Ministerial paper) sounds t
he alarm in this strain:

"Customs Tariff\ Menace of the United fa

nanufactorics of Lyons. The question has

rill determine that destructive measure. It is n
ot to be doubted that so hign a duty would
ause, immediately, a considerable decrease tj
i the consumption of the article. We trust. %
berefore, that the President of our Council L
rill bestir himself to prevent the threat from
eing executed. The United States have u
eed of us as much as vre of them. H strict- te
r speaking, they can do without our silks, j|
ecause that, indeed, is, for all nations, a merhandise
of luxury, they could not dispense, f
ira long time, with our consumption of their
ytton. e
n
The following is a paragraph from an article q,
n the subject in the La Press^ considered
te ablest Journal m France. w
Numerous petitions and fiscal exigencies w
ue excited Congress to entertain the scheme
f[laying a maximum duty on our silks. That ct
ountry, which a few years ago, boasted so gi
iucIi of being free from debt, has now a heavy re
>a J, and. what is worse, begins to experience w
deficiency of moans to discharge it. In adition
to these impulses, there is a desire to re. ai
iliate upon France. The (Jmted|Statcs have
omplained, for a considerable time, that their 'u
reaty of commerce with France, which will tti
xpire in 1842, ha proved for them a bad or ; tli
K?rs bargain, ( un marche de dupes ') Their ' ft.
xpnrts to us consist of little else than cotton. | )r

rom Franco. Hence, each year, an exporla- j ,
on of specie, which exhausts the reserve of 1
he precious metals is indispensable to support '
he enormous mas6 of American paper money, c
nd thus contributes to multiply crises. t<

All this occurred in much less time than a

Mr. Wise moved that the two gentlemen (

Mr. Dromgoole said he was hot for per- M

vithout express ng the hope that the mem- *

io;hing of he commencement of this diffi. g

ween the parte s ; nor did he intend to im- a

erfertlv disinterested in calling upon the c
nembers of the House to unite with him in
oppressing these disorders. It was due to ti

New York, April ?2.
New York and Virginia.?Most of our
aders are aware (hat a controversy is pen.
ng between the S;ates of Now York.and
irginin, growing out of the refusal of Gov.
award to deliver up to the authorities of
irginia, three colored men, residents of %
us Siate, viz. Peter Johnson, Edward
m;th, and Isaac Gransey, who had been delanded
by the Governor of Virginia on a
large of theft, in stealing a slave within
ie jurisdiction ard against the laws of this
tate. At the recent session of the Virginia
?egislature, resolutions we repassed to t lie
fleet that the reasons assigned by Governor -*
ieward for refusing the surrender, are
wholly unsatisfactory," and that the act of
fusal cannot be acquiesced in. Also re.
uesting the Governor to renew his corres.
ondence with Governor Seward, asking
im to review the grounds of bis decision.
Accordingly Governor Gilmer has address.
d a long and able communication toGovrnor
Seward, dated April 6th, Vhich tho
itter has submitted to the consideration of
r.oniclnlti^ npprtmiinnied hv a brief
ui , fessngp,
in which he expresses a desire that
tie opinion of the Executive and of the Gen.
ra| Assembly of Virginia may he consider(I
under the most favorable auspices, and
hat his own may be submitted to the most
iffid examination. The manner of GoverorGilm'T's
communication is entirely cour ous,
nnd the matter, as we said before, is
/nighty and convincing. He plan's himself f pen
the national compact?the Consfituon
of the United S'ates,?and shows th at it
oes distinctly, and almost in so many words,
pquirethe surrender ol parties charged nnd
emnaded, as are the three colored nv-n in ^
juesrion. And to make the case stronger,
ik quotes from the decisions of our own Jud- - *
:?'S, in perfect accoqjjjnce with the position
ssum-d by Virginia ?n the present case.
\ will con cnt myself (siywGov. Gilmer) * *
vith inviting your Excellency's attention to
In- case of Clark, a fugitive from the state
if Rhode Island, and decided in your su- reme
court. In this casn it was assumed,
liat no "-crime" had been committed, or
ras in fact irnpu'.'d to the fugitive inasmuch
s the effence charged upon him would only
/arrant proceedings of a civd nature in his
wn Stale. Cri'ef Justice Savage, in delivering
the opinion o'* the court,sayw;?** TIkj
irst answer is, that the statute of Khode Is- i
md is not properly before us. An offence
if a highly immoral character is stated in
be warrant, and is certified by the Govcrtor
of Ri,o.lf Island to have been pinde crinmal
b\ Pa* laws of that State. This is ev?
lence enough in this stage of the preceednes."
He proceeds* again thus : ** Had
iur Const i uiion and laws been silent on this
ubj.-ct, and no conventional arrangement
(\isted between theseverul States composng
our con'ederacy, it may be conceded
Imt the pra -lice arising from tbo comity of
iution.8 would be applicable, and before, wo
vould surrender in one state any persoa.den
indid by another as a fugitive from j?#? .
ipp ir would be ourdu'v to examin* ino
' " ^ * ,'-~W- ~
ho evidence of the alleged crime, and lw
mlisfied that no reasonable doubt existed ne
o his guilt. But under our Federal Gov.
srnment this matter has been regulated, and
ve are nor I eft to the uncertainty arising
'rom an inquiry in one stale into the p?rtir.?
jlarsof an offence committed in another.?
il?re th?,n(the Federal Constitution.) itthe
aw on the subject, a positive regulation, and
antamount to- a treaty stipulation ; and we
tre no; to resort to the eomity of nations fur
3ur guidance. Every person who is charged
witti a erirni- in any S at'?, and shall flee
n o annth'T. shall he -lelivered.
It is prop'-r to add, th it the Legislature
)( Virginia, in connexion with the proceedngs
above indicated, resolved that if tho
oursM pursued bv the Executive of New
fork should be sanctioned by the Slate,
meaning, probably, the Legislature,] and
lerslstcd in, "it will become the solemn du?f
Virginia 'o adopt the most decisive and
fficiVnt measures for the protection of her
it Zens, and the maintenance of rights
vhich she cannot and will not, unJer any
ircumstances, surrender or abandon," A
esoiution was also passed* requesting the
Jovernor to open a correspondence with
he Executive of each slave holding State,
oliciiing their "co-opcration in any necesary
and proper measures of redress which
Virginia may be forced to adopt."
A controversy of a similar character is
lending between Georgia and Maine,
The question, in its bcaribg upon the
lave-holding States, is one of manifeat
mportauce; for if men from the free
hates may enter the slave-holding States
nd carry off slaves, or entice them away,
nd there is no redress to the master, he
olds his1 property" by a very frail tenure.
Ve have no doubt that within the last five
ears, many hundreds of slaves hav* been
ius carried off and smuggled into Canada,
r elsewhere, and that there are regular re*
eivers and agents at different points along
le most feasible routes, in the free States,
'hose business it is to facilitate the process
f escape. For further particulars, enquire
f the Aboliiionists.i
. .We make these observations that our reaers
may sec, if they did not see before that
ie controversy is one which wHI necessarily
xcite a deep interest, throughout the slaveoldins
Slates, and esoeciaflv those which %
order on the free States. It is not that
rirgmia cares for the three men abore
amed, one way or the other. She would
ever hare troubled herself to look after
>em, were it not for the principle involved,
md this movement is designed* we pre*
jme, not for their individual punishment,
ut to deter others from similar conduct,
y securing the acknowledgement of the
ght of demand, and the necessity of sur;nder.
If our Legislature are about to take
round on the subject, we trust they will
insider the matter well at the outset?
1 hile we acknowledge the Caostitution, let
