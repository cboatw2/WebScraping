which mast cccupy the early attention of
Congress, will be revision of duties on
foreign im|K>rts. It is unjust in principle
that for an article of such necessary consumption
as woollens 40 per cent should
be exacted, while for articles of luxury,
such as wines and silks, imposts should
be adjusted on equitable principles. The
system of such duties for woollens would
afford ample protection if the duty were
. reduced to 25 per cent. These cash duties
have effected a great alteration in the extent
of protection. No one who has
watched the operation of the scheme of
allowing long credits for the duties, but
Jnust have observed its decterious operation,
as well on the commerce as the
general business of the country.?
It has beea the basis of much of
that rash adventure by which the trading
transactions of the country have been

The actual receipts therefore, have beer

It will be seen that at first, a sum

Having done that, it was difficult to raise
additional subscriptions, after it was sup
posed the requisite sum had once been
provided, and but for the ladies it ncvci
