BV-GONE YEARS.
"Call them, let me see them."?Mjcheth.
I see them now?I see them all?
The shadowy train of by-gone days?
On Memory's mirror see they fall
With still increasing rays.
The playmates of my childhood's hours!
"Withundim'd eye and unbunit cheek?
Nature's young and starry flowers !
I almost hear them speak.
And that sweet girl! now woman grown.?
Now vanishing with fairy flight?
Like bloom and blossom, fruit, all gone?
Alas! the early blight.
Companion of maturcr years!
With laurel'd brow?where Genius placed
The seal which still each heart endears,
And never was disgraced ;
I sec thee too! whose every look
Imparted joys of purest ray ;?
Thou'rt gone?a rose leaf on a brook?
Eorm'd, seen, then swept away.
On, on still glide the airy crowd !
With noiseless footstep still they move;?

been a tavern keeper, and many a glare have I

zens of others that I tee here."
" That's a fact," broke in the President, "many
a gin toddy and brandy punch have I taken at
your bar. But times are changed now, and we
hare begun to carry the war right into the enemy's
canp. And our war has not been altogether unsuccessful,
for we have taken prisoner one of the
rum-scllere' bravest generals 1 But go on, friend
W , let us have your experience."
M As to my experience, Mr. President," the ex.
tavern keeper resumed, " in rum-selling and rumdrinking,
for I have done a good deal of both in
my time, that would be rather too long a story to
tell to-night?and one that I would rather forget
than relate. It makes me tremble and sick at
heart, whenever I look back on the evil that I have
done. I therefore usually look ahead with the
hope of doing some good to my fillow-mcn.
" But there is one incident that I will relate.?
For the last five years, a hard-working mechanic,
with a wife and several small children, came regularly
almost every night to tny tavern, and spent
the evening in the bar-room. He came to drink,
of course, and many and many a dollar of his hard
earnings went into my till. At last he became a
perfect sot, working scarcely one-fourth of his
time, and spending all he earned in liquor. His
poor wife had to take in washing to support herself
and children, while he spent his time and the
little he could make at my bar. But his appetite
for liquor was so strong, that his week's earnings
were usually all gone by Tuesday or Wednesday,
and then I had to chalk up a score against him.
to bo paid off when Saturday night came. This
core gradually increased, until it amounted to
tliree or four dollars over his regular Saturday
night's pay, when I refu&ed to sell him any more
liquor until it was settled. On the day after I had
thus refused him, he came in with a neat mourning
breast pin, enclosing some hair?no doubt, I
thought, of a deceased relative. This he offered
in payment of what he owed. I accepted it, for
the pin I saw at once was worth double the amount
of my bill. I did not think, or indeed care about
the question, whether he was the owner or not: I
wanieu inv own, nnu in ui} iriuni car^inuin iu
get my own, I hesitate d not to take a little more
than ray own.
141 laid the brca6t pin away, and all things went
on smoothly for a while. But he gradually got
behind hand again, and again I cut off his supply
of liquor. This time he brought me a pair of brass
andirons, and a pair of brass candlesticks, and I
took them and wiped off the score against him.?
At last he brought mc a large family Bible, and I
took that too?thinking no doubt I cculd sell it
for something.
44 On the Sunday afterwards, having nothing to
do?for I used to shut my bar on Sundays, thinking
that it was not respectable to se 11 liquor on
that day?I opened this poor drunkard's family
Bible, scarcely thinking of what I was doing.?
The fir8t place 1 tumed to was the family record.
There it was stated, that, upon a certain day, he
had been married to Emily . I had known
Emily when I was a young man, very well, and
had once thought seriously of offering myself to
her in marriage. I remembered her happy young
face, and seemed suddenly to hear a tone of meny
laughter.
44 4 Foor creature!' 1 sighed involuntarily as a
thought of her present condition crossed my mind ;
and then with no very pleasant feelings I turned
orer another leaf. There was the record of the
birth of four children ; the last had been made recently,
and was in the mother's hand.
441 never had such strange feelings as now
came over me. I felt that I had no business with
this book. But I tried to stifle my feelings, and
turned over several leaves quickly. As I suffered
my eyes to rest upon an open page, thcee words
arrested my attention:
44 4 Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging;
wheeo is deceived thereby is not wisc.'
44 This wac juet the subject that under the feelinge
I then had, I wished to avoid, and so I referred
to another place. There I read?
44 4 Who hath woe ? Who hath sorrow ? Who
hath wound*1 Who hath babbling 7 Who hath
A gloom is welling on my brain,
A darkness deepens in my breast
That thus rccall'd, the mirror'd train
Should sadden at the best.
'Twcrc better far the glass to shiver,
Than Joys reviv'd to dim with tears,
To strep in Lethe's wave forever
All thoughts of by-gone years.

THE DRUNKARD'S BIBLE.
" Mr. Frcsident," said a short, stout man, with
a good humored countenance, and a florid complexion,
rising as the last speaker took his scat;
411 have been a tavern keeper."
At this announcement, there was a movement
1 '* ? ??'' ovravgeinri nf in
redness of ryes ? They that tarry long at th
wine. At the last it biteth like a 6erpent, it sting
eth like an adder.'
' I felt like throwing the book from me. Bu
once more I turned the leaves, and my eyes restc
I upon these words?
" ' Woe unto him that giveth his neighbc
drink; that puttcst the bottle to him, and maker
him drunken.'
" I closed the book suddenly, and threw it dowi
Then for half an hour I paced the room back
wards and forwards in a state of mind such as
never before experienced. I had become painfull
conscious of the direful evils resulting from intern
, perance, and still more painfully conscious that
had been a willing instrument in the spread c
these evils. I cannot tell you how much I sul
fered that day and night, nor describe the fearfu
conflict that took place in my calling, and th
plain dictates of truth and humanity. It \va
about nine o'clock, I think, on that evening, tha
I opened the drunkard's Bible again, with a kin<
or despairing hope that I should meet there witl
something to direct me. I opened at the Psalms
and read two or three chapters. As I read or
without finding any thing that seemed to appi
directly to my case, I felt an increasing desire t
abandon my calling, because it was injurious t
my fellow-men. After I had read the Bible, I re
tired to bed, but could not sleep. I am sure tha
during that night I thought of every drunken mai
to whom I sold liquor, and of all their beggare*
families. In the brief sleep that I obtained,
dreamed that I saw a long line of tottering drunk
ards, with their wives and children in rags. Ani
a loud voice said, ' Who hath done this?'
" The answer, in a still louder voice, directed
I felt to me, smote upon my car like a heavy pea
of thunder?
44 4 Thou art the man!'
4* From this troubled slumber I awoke to slee
no more that night. In the morning the last an
most powerful conflict came. The question to b
decided was?
I 44 Shall I open my tavern, or at once abandoi
the dreadful traffic in liquid poison ?

lips the cup of confusion. My next step was t
j turn the spigot of every keg or barrel of spirit
; upon the floor. My bottles and decanters wer
I likewise emptied. Then I carne and signed you
j total abstinence pledge, and what is better, neve
I rested until I had persuaded the man whose Bibl
i had been of so much use to me, to sign the plcdgi
I likewise.
| u And now, Mr. President, I am keeping, a

I king rest tution as fast as possible. There are a
j least half a dozen families that my tavern helpcc

j small quantity of groceries every week, in manj
i cases equal to the amount that used to be spent a

Welsh tells a very good story of a mar
who was in the country on a visit where they ha?
no liquor. He got up two hours before breakfast
and wanted his bitters. None to be had; o
Cvurso he felt bad ! " IIow far is it to a tavern V
he asked. " Four miles." So off he started?

IT DOES NO GOOD AT ALL.
A gentleman in the city who was in the habi
of drinking his brandy and water, moderately o
course had a negro servant who was a model o
sobriety. But a few days ago, the gentlernai
came home and fcund Jim very drunk. Tin
next morning the offender was called up for an cx
planation. He came forward with a peculiarly
distressed and mournful look, and when inquirer
of what this meant, he r< plied, ' Why, master, 1
see when any thing troubles you, or you 'eel bad
you always drink brandy amazingly. Well, yes
terday I broke one of your china platters, ant
knew ycu would be sorry, so it troubled me. 1
felt very bad indeed, and I thought would tak<
some brandy too; so I kept drinking and drink
ing, and I got drunk before I thought. But it die
no good at all. For I feel just as bad about the
platter, and then I am mortified to think that ]
should get drunk. It docs no good at all to drink
xchen you are in trouble."
The gentleman said that he was so struck wit!
the honest simplicity of the negro and the gooc
sense of the conclusion, as well as with the evi
inflnrneeof his own example upon those beneath
him, that he was determined to banish bis brand}
forever, and is now fully convinced that " it doei
no good at all"?Teetotaler.
A LARK AND A IIAWK.
It may be questioned whether the human mine
could have shown more sagacity than is cxhibitec
in the following ease of instinct in a bird :?As z
gentleman was travelling on horseback a shon
time since, in the west of Norfolk, England, alarli
dropped on the pommel of his saddle, and spread
ing its wings in a submissive manner, coweret
close to him; he stopped his horse, and sat foi
some time in astonishment, looking at tho bird
which he supposed to be wounded; but endeavor
ing to take it, it crept round him, and placed it
self behind; turning himself on the saddle t<
observe it, it dropped between the legs of the hors<
and remained immoveable; it then struck hiur
that the poor thing was pursued, and as its las
resource, hazarded its safety with him; when look
ing up, a hawk was perceived hovering dircctlj
; over them. The poor bird again mounted tin
! saddle ; under the eye of its protector the disap
pointed hawk shifted its station, and the little fu
gitive, watching its opportunity, darted over th<
hedge, and was hid in an instant.
TRICE OF AN OPINION.
In a cold night of Novt mbrr, in tin
vear 1*35. a man, enveloped tn a Inrgi
cloak, rapped at the door of one of I In
most distinguished advocates of Paris
He was quickly shown to the chambei
of the learned lawyer.
Sir," he M?id, placing upon the tahh
a large parcel of papers, "I am rich, bu
the suit that lias been instituted agains
me this day will entirely ruin me. A
my age, a fortune is not to lie re.built
so that the loss of my suit will conden
me forever to the most frightful misery
D >
I onmc tn aslf the aid of votir talents
e Here are the papers ; as to the facts, I
will, ifyou please, expose them clearly to
you."
The advocate listened atentively to
d the stranger, then opened the parcel, exa
mined all the papers it contained, and
r said, " Sir, the action laid against you
is founded in justice and morality; unfortunately,
in the admirable perfection
of our codes, law does not always accord
j with justice, and here the law is for you.
y If, therefore, you rest strictly upon the
law and avail yourself, without exception,
I of all the means in your favor?if, above, I
if all, these means arc exposed with clear
ness and force, you will infallibly gain
tl J your suit, and nobody can afterwards dis
e puu; (hat fortune that you fear to lose."
g * Nobody in the world," replied the
1 j client, ??is so competent to do this as |
^ j yourself; an opinion drawn up in this <
^ sense, nnd signed by you would render
'' one invaluable. I am hold enough to
* hope that you will not refuse it nie."
* The skilful advocate reflected some
0 moments, taking up again the papers
that he had pushed awuy with an abrupt*
t ness peculiar to him, said that he woul I
a draw up the opinion, and that it would he I
d finished the following day at the same
1 hour.
The client was punctual to his appointd
ment. The advocate presented him
w ith the opinion, and without taking the
' trouble to reply to the thanks with w hich
^ the other overwhelmed him, said to him
rudely?
p 44 Here is the opinion ; there is no
d who, after having seen that, will
t> condemn you. Give me3,(100 francs.
The client was struck dumb and mon
t ion less with surprise.
44 You are free to keep your money,"
s aid the advocate,44 as I am to throw tiie
0 opinion into the fire."
h So speaking, he advanced toward the
'* hiinney, but the other stopped nun. and
r ieclared that he would pay the sum der
maimed ; but he had only halt of it with ,
1 ^,m*
lie drew, in fact, from his pocket-book
t J,500 francs, in bank notes. The ndvo.
ate with one hand took Ihe notes, and
t with the other threw the op nion into a
1 drawer.
i "But," said the client, "Iain going,
r if you please, to give you my note for
t i the remainder."
"I want money. Bring me 1,500
* franc2, or you shall not have one line."
1 There was no remedy, the 3,000 francs
* were paid. But the client, to avenge
himself for l>eing so pillaged, hastened to
1 circulate this anecdote; it got into the
j papers, and for a fortnight there was a
t deluge of witticism of all kinds upon the
f disinterestedness of the great advocate, j
' Those who did'nt laugh at it, said that it
- was deplorable that a man ot such merit
? should he tainted with a vice so degrad*
ingns avarice. Even his friends were
moved by it, and some of them went so
far as to remonstrate with him publicly;
hut the only reply he made was by shrugging
his shoulders, and then, as every
f jibing is quickly forgot at Paris, people
j' soon ceased to talk of this.

Course of Rural Economy, with more than
Two Thousand Engravings, representing the
various Implements, Alachine?, sets of Apparatus,
Breeds of Animals, Tree*, Shrubs, and

Revised by a Committee of Scientific and
Practical Agriculturists, belonging to the Agricnltural
Society of France, under the direction
of M.T, Bailey, Member of the Societies
of Agricultural and Horticulture. Translated
from the French, with Notes adapting it to the
use of farmers in the United States of America,
by Elizur Wright, Jr., formerly Profespor
of Matt hematics, and Nat jral Philosophy in
the Western Reserve College, Translator of
La Fontainc'g &c.
Agriculture is the foundation of all human
arts?the art for which man was made, anil
the perfection of which is his chief happim-ss
and glury as the lord temporal of tins planet*
Of this sublime art, all other arts and science*
are bur satellites, ineir Business unnj; su w?u
cm, enlighten, and adorn it with their moonshine.
Consequently no man more 'nan the
agriculturist needs the full use of his brains,
and a perfect command of all the treasures ot
human experience. So thp farmers of the ,
UnitedStates view the matter; and in preS'-n'ing
them with a translation of the cdo.
hrated Maison Rustique, of the French, we
have no doutit of their hearty support. It ic
the work of all works on prac\icai agriculture
?ihe most scientific, clear, and c? mprrhensive,
France has long excelled in profitable
farming. This ts the source of her wea'tb.
England is rich by coals and commerce. Her
agriculture is splendid, but sometimes costs
more than it comes to. Those who nave
fortunes to spend may buy the vast works of
Marshall, Dickson Arthur Young, Loudon,
&c., but those who wish to get a fortune out
of the soil wili find the French writers better
able to show thein the way. The excellence
ot French elementary w orks is well known to
all teachers. For centuries, the A/aison
Rustique has been, in France, the standard
elementary work?the spelling book and
grammar of farming. The present edition for
44 the nineteenth century," has be.Mi rew ritten
and brought up with the 44 inarch of mind,*'
by sixty of the ablest "agronoines" of France.
It has all the light of the latest improvements,
not only in Frnuce, but in all Europe.
William Cobbet, one of the most successful
farmers both in England and America, who
wrote the best style and the best French
grammer that ever was, valued the Maison
Rustiques, not only as an encyclopedia of
farming, but us a means of educating his
children. He w as his own schoolmaster. In
win'er evenings his family resolved itself into
a school, and ho thus speaks of the use then
made ol this work;?
44 Our book of never failing resource was
the French Maison Rustique. or Farm House, j
which, it is said, was the book that first temp,
ted Dugnosnois (I think that was his name,)
the famous physician in the reign of Louis
XIV., to learn to read. Here are all the fourlegged
animals, from the horse down to the
mouse, portraits and all; all the birds, reptiles,
insects; all the modes of rearing managing,
and using the tame ones, and of destroying
those that are mischievous; all the varions
traps, springs, nets; all the labors of the field
and garden exhibited, as well as the rest, in
plates; and there was I, in any leisure moments,
to join this inquisitive group, to read
the French, and tell thein what it mean* d in
English, when the picture did not sufficiently
explain itseff. /never have been without a
copy of this book for forty years, except during
the time that I was fleeing from the dungeons
cf Castlereagh and Sidmouth, in 1817, and
when I got to Long Island, the first book I
bought was another Afaison Rustique,*'?Advice
to Young Men, Art. 291.
Of the qualifications of the translator, it may
be said that he is a practical farmer, and in
regard to his translation of La Fontaine, which
has been reprinted in England, an English re"
viewer confesses that he 44 does not knew the
English writer who could have done it better.'
