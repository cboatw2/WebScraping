rather exposes unripened grain to he
more injured. Ilence so far as regards
these two modes, ail who have made a
comparison, seem to concur in the opinion,
that stripping the corn of its tops and
and loaves, is a bad practice* W illiam
Catmicbael, of Virginia, has given us in
the Farmer's Register, his experiments in
this (natter, which go to corroborate the
conclusion we have drawn. He took,
promiscuously 100 ears from corn that
had been topped, and 100 ears from that
which hud not been topped, growing side
by side. The first weighed.
On the cob, GO lbs.?shelled, 41 lbs.,
and measured 21 qts. 1 pt.
The other, weighed .">4 lbs.?shelled, 4G
lbs., and measured 20 tps.
Show ing a difference of nearly onc-ht'ih
to favor of the unstripped or untopped
corn. The fact is, that topping not
only prevents the further elaboration
0/the sap, which can take place in the
leaves, and which is necessary for the
'growth of the corn, but it deprives the
'grain of much that is already elaborated,
and on its way to the grain. If a fruit
tree is deprived of its leaves, before
the fruit lias attained its growth, or
mature lluvor, the fruit will no longer
grow, nor will it attain high llavor, for its
supply of elaborated food, or vegetable
blot)d, is cut off by the loss of leaves.
We have noticed this particularly in the
plum.
Satisfactory experiments have not been
made to determine, whether it is most advantageous
to cut the crop when the grain
is merely glazed, or to wait till it is perfectly
ripe. This will depend upon the
amount of loss, if any, in the grain, by
early harvesting,?the relative value of
* - ? ??.1
ttie grain ana toauer, anu iue pruspcn ui
both being injured by early frosts?for
neither arc liable to suffer from frost after
the crop has been cut and put into shocks.
Tt is to be noticed, that in early cutting,
the stalks are succulent, and abound in
elaborated sap, on its descent from the
leaves to the grain, and that this supply of
food to the grain continues to improve,
though we think it likely that the that undergoes
some trilling diminution. But if
frost is likely to intervene before the completc
maturity of the crop, there is no
doubt but the corn will suffer less in shook
than it will standing, while the fodder will
be materially injured by frost. Admitting
that there is a small loss in grain by
early cutting, though it is undoubtedly
less than when it is topped, the difference
in the value of the fodder, under the two
modes of management, is vastly in favor of
early harvesting. Wc do not pretend to
calculate to a nicetv. the difference in nu
~ mf '
tiitious properties, of corn stalks cut in a
succulent state, early in September, well
cured and well housed, and those left
standing till October or November in the
field, but we should think it fifty per cent.
Well cured corn stalks aiTord an excellent
winter food for neat cattle; and when
fouder is likely to be in demand, they raav
be made to contribute largely to the profits
of the farm. Several of our acquaintance
have kept their neat stock almost
entirely upon this fodder during the past
wjnter, and we have done the like, having
first cut ours in a cutting machine; and so
far as we can learn, the cattle kept upon
them are ?n excellent condition.
The preceding considerations justify us
in recommending that in the management
of the Indian corn croj), the following rules
be observed, at least partially, so far as
to test their correctness:
1. That the corn harrow and cultivator
be substituted for the plough in the culture
of the crop.
2. That the plants be not hilled, or but
slightly so?this not to prevent the soil being
often stirred and kept clean. And,
3. That in harvesting, the crop be cut
at the ground as soon as the grain is glazed.
The Roman Cato has left farmers the
two following maxims:
1. Never to work within doors when
there is any thing to be done without.

prcad of the small pox in Marlborough at that
ime and all the deaths which it caused wore to
ascribed solely to the steam doctors. Having
lot the least knowledge (a9 all intelligent men
cquainted with them know) of the organs
rhich compose the human frame?or tho strucuro
of these organs?or the diseases to .which
hey are liable?or tho symptoms by which these
liseases aro ascertained to exist, and by which
he}* arc distinguished?or of the remedies appro>riate
to each?or tho tirno and mode of apply,
rig tiiesc remedies with safety?or tho specific
fleets of particular remedies on particulars
rgans. or of any thing else necessary to quality
hem for tho treatment of disease; they still by
iigh sounding and confident pretentions gulled
heir unsuspecting and too credulous neighbors
o give them employment as physicians, and
hen when called to a caso of small pox, mistakag
it for measles, they permitted visitors to frcucnt
the sick room, till the discaso became inactions
and many took it, several of whom
ied. Now during tho whole lime that tho disaso
is infectious and for some time beforo it beomrs
so, the symptoms arc so distinctly marked
nd they aro particularly so very different from
lose of measles that, as we remarked on a forler
occasion, any negro not an idiot, might be
lught in loss than an hour by a person of eometont
knowledge to distinguish the one from
he other.
At the blunders of the steamers no one, we
appose, was surprized. Similar blunders they
rnst, from the very nature of tho ease, be connualiy
making. But every diseaso has not,
ke small pox, a property by which it proclaims
> the world their blunders. In ordinary cases
'they mistake tho disease, or tho organ on
hich it falls, or tho remedy which is called for,
ad, in consequence of tho mistake kill their
iticnt, there is no ono present who can detect
le error, and tho death is ascribed only to the
tolcnce of the disease.
After a struggle of more than two months
ora tho timo when we first called attention to
lis subject, threo of tho steamers, Messrs James
i. Terry, Elias Sinclair and Robert! J. Steele,
:rewod up their moral courage to the sticking
Dint ventured upon a defenco in tho Fayette,
ille Observer. They must have believed tho
ablic to be a great gullible booby roady to swu!.
i\v any thiirg." And perhaps wo ought to con
siilcr such belief natural enough after they had
| found men ready so lhr to credit their preten'
sions to medical skill as .0 entrust their lives in
| their hand?.
Thoir ground of defence was that at tan stage !
! of small pox when they wero called to the first
I case, it is not distinguishable from measels.*
I .
After stating (with a hand pointing to tho state,
j ment)that they were called to the first case "before
tho eruption" they quote in juxta position, from
Thomas' practice of Medicine, the symptoms of
small pox and measles as laid down by that writer
before tho eruption, and then add with an air of
great triumph, now "tell us how you would
; teach an ignorant .Marlborough negro to distin|
guish the two diseases, particularly at the tiino
j when the steam doctor pronounced tho disease j
j to be measles."
( To this we answered first: that by taking j
i iTound iu their defence which referred only to '
I the stago of small pox before tho eruption, they
but the more palpably exposed theit ignorancoof
! tho. disease ; because it is not infectious until
[ after the eruption: and secondly, that according to
i tho symptoms of the two diseases as quoted by !
themselves, and relied upon to prove the impossibility
of distinguishing them, there are present
; in measles and absent in . mall pox, " effusion of
* tears" 44 swelling of the eyelid" 44 frequent I
sneezing and a discharge of acrid water from the
! nose." Now ho must ho an idiot unless both deaf Si
i blind, who can't be taught in loss than an hour to
j distinguish a disease in which theso symptoms
j are present from one in which they are absent;

J "doctor" confessedly unablo to discriminate a
\ frequently sneezing from a non-sneezing patient
| is fortunate if nothing worse befalls him than
1 mistaking his small pox for measles.
The reply of the courteous and well bred geu'
tlemen is, "falsehood," " You misrepresent oil
i statements," "We never asserted that small pox J
j w#s contagious before eruption," "We never conI
tended for the impossibility of distinguishing
i small pox from measles. We only intended to
! impress the public that ns a majority ofthe most
! prominent symptoms worn precisely similar any '
[ one would be liable tu mistake the disease.''
i Well, courteous sirs, you Iwvc a right to ini
tcrpret your own language. If you knew as you
! now allogn that small pox is not infectious till !

which relates only to thestngo before eruption?

I contractor must be a creature or a tmcR scuu
if not of long cars who would receive this
similarity as an excuse from his agent for buying

I They ask how we could have prevented the
| spread of the disease when ten persona took the
infection at once and were confined by it about
tho same time. We would have collected them
as near together as convenient and prevented the
intercourse of all persons Iiab'o to tho disease ;
| and thus wc repeat, we, or any other physician
I would have prevented all tho deaths which ocj
currcd.
The question between us and tho steamers is
whether if a well informed physician had been
called to Mf. II. Smith when the steamers were,
| he would havo discovered tho nature of the discaso
' in time to prevent its communication to others.
Wc repeat, for the benefit of our .Marlboro' noighbors,
facts which wo formerly stated in the Fayettcvillo
Observer and which must sottlo this
question. Tho first ease of small pox ever seen by [
ourselves we attended as pliysician, and wo discovered
it to be small pox us soon us tho eruption
appeared, &, before the disease became infectious,
which enabled us to prevent its spreading. A
friend of ours some years since sickened at a
public house below Cieo: Town without any suapicion
of the character of tho di&xjase. His ph}'- i
sician, when tho eruption appeared and beforo
the disease became infectious, saw from the symp- {
toins that it was small pox. Proper measures
were of course taken to prevent its 6prca<L A
similar ease oefcurred on Society Hill a few years
sinco, and another in this town. About thirty
negroes who wcro not protected against the small
pox were in the habit of daily intercouso with the
patient in the last mentioned case till the disease
manifested itself so plainly by tho eruption that
the physician in attendance had him separated
and yet not ono of thcin took it. Now these
I facts prove that if a physician had been called
to Mr. Smith when tho steamers wcro mai no
would have prevented tho spread of tho disease,
and no deaths would have occurred from it, for
all who took it from the wagoner recovered It
is plain then that every death from small pox in
Marlboro1 or its neighborhood last spring is to
be ascribed solely to the steamers.
Thoy ask " if" our own patient referred to
above " should unfortunately dia before tho eruption,"
what then ? why if wo wcro as ignorant
as a steam doctor ; if we could not see what organs
were affected, or what functions deranged ;
if we had brought ou inflamation of stomach and
if we had then killed our patient by emetics or
in any other way, then wo would, thus far, havo
been as guilty as a steam doctor. But there is
another guilt of somo other men not a thousand
miles off which we would not havo incurred.
For we would at oncoand forever in deep ponitcnco
havo quit tho practice of medicine. Wo
would as soon kill men on the highway for their
A?
i money as in uiu mca room.
The steamers most piteously lament that some
one else hail not prevented tfio small pox from
coming into their neighbourhood. 44 Would that
ho had" they exclaim, then 44 he as well as us
would net have been so belaboured." Oh that
sonio one else had informed 44 us" what disease
44 ua" were called to treat, then 44 ii#'* would not
have been subjected the painful necessity of
exposing 44 us'a" ignoranco to all men as 44
now have b#en. Well it is not our intention to
44 belabour" you any further on the subject.

The Star ofMonday remarks that Mr. !
J. Q. Adams, the Ex-President, in the
House of Representatives, though never at |
a loss for words, read his culogium on the j
death of Madison. There was good rea- \
son for his departure from the usual j
mode of addressing the IIouSc on the oc- j
casion alluded to. Mr. Adams has cer- t
tainiy proved, during the session that has f
just closed, both his readiness and ability to j
address that body upon an impulse of the ,
moment, and upon the most unexpected
emergency. But the precaution of writing
out and reading his remarks upon the death
of James Madison must be allowed to have
been a wise one, inasmuch as we learn *

The Fredericksburgh Arena says of
Mr. Madison:
We understand that he left, ready for the
rress, to which it will be forthwith given,

which formed the Constitution, taten
at the time, with notes, &c., end a
;ompe?dious history of the events which

rvork will make two large octavo volumes,
ind be published simultaneously in thi9
country, and in England. It is hazarding
ittle to say that no work of greater interest
and importance ever issued from
he American press. .His correspondence
md other writings will be published, from
time to time, and will constitute a mass of
the most valuable political literature in tho
language. r

Unfathomable Wells?The AUcgliiuy
Magazine, published in Pennsylvania*
states that a well was dug some years ago
n the great valley between the north and
south mountains in Franklin county, Pennsylvania
and another 30 or40ro<Udisant,
in Cumberland county the bottom of
vhich at the depth of 3G feet deep in each,
suddenly gave way, and a torrent of water
lowed up. A lead, with 50 fathoms of
ine ,was sunk without finding any obstrucion,
and the wells remain in the same *
state at present. The presumption, says
lie writer, is thrrt there is a substerranen
lake in that quarter, extending under the
iiase of the vast primitive ranges of moun
fains between the Susquehanna and Pittsburgh,
on the Ohio.

'Charles Pinckncy, Esq., otic of His
Majesty's Council of South-Carolina, has
lately had the honor to wnit on Her Royal
Highness the Princess of Wales, at Leicester
House, with a piece of silk damask,
if the growth and product of bis plantation
n that Province, and a fine blue with Carolina
indigo, which Her Royal Highness
was pleased to receive very favorably,and
to declare her satisfaction in seeing such
improvements made in the produce of our
Colonies; and so much approved of tbc

"In the year 1757,1,552 weight in silk
jails were received at the filature in Georgia.
The last year 1758, 7,040 wero
produced. And this year, 1759, 10,000.
fhere has been received at Savanab con*
dderably above 20,000 lbs., though the
reason has not been favorable.
"This increase 19 to be imputed to the
lumber of new hands employed in raising
hat valuable article. It is remarkable
hat the raw silk exported from Georgia
sells in London from two to three shillings
n the pound more than that brought front
iny other part of the world. We have
eason to believe that many in this Provnce
too, will turn their attention to the
culture of silk."
