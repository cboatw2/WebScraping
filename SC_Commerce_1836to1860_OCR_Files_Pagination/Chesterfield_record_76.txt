Tiiiscircums.auoe had induced Sir David

during tiiatperioJ unbraced by the letters
of Junius, and the r< suit upon his mind was

Vi.s the auihor of those letters. That he
was a powerful writer, and that he wrote in .
the styled* Junius, ho hud sufficient proofs'
in h s own possesion. T.icn there were the '
remarkable lacts, that ho had been under
Secretary of State to Lord Shelburne, had,
been seat on a lucrative mission to India,
at the very period Junius announces Ids own !
retirement, and had perished on a second .
voyage to India, in the Swallow Pakket, to.
gether with probably some written evidences,
that had he died a natural death, might .
have ere this cleared up the suspicion; lor, ]
after all, it is but a suspicion, ami was so ,.
regarded by others at the time, especially j j
Sir Walter Sco t, Lord Minto and Mr. Jet- i.
*
frev, to whom the gentleman, that Sir I)a
? I (
ha l shown Macpuerson's correspondence ,
to, had mentioned the affair; and they, aficr ,
seeing ilte letters ofLachlan McLean, con-',
enred in opinion that Sir David was on a^J
wrmgsCen:. This opinion, too, was ex-!,
pressed 11 such a decided manner as to i ~
awaken a though: in the gentleman's mind j
that they were among the iniatcd few who
knew who was ihe author of the Ict.crs o\ ;
Junius !.
It was agreed, however, on ail hands, | j
that, on tiie return of this person to Ameri-' j
ca. he shouid mak" some inquiries in Pliiia- ,
deiptiiaabout Lncldan McLean, and the!,
newspaper at acks upon Governor i lnmii-1 v
win. T.'iis was intiuctuously done. As-' ,
sisted by others, ail the accessible files of :
the newspapcr^pubiishcd during the govern-' c
meut of [frtinilron were examined/ and notii-! c
infr vi*;?c found. S. uric information, however, f
respecting Lachlan McLean, was collected, ' i
the late Bishop White, then a boy at School, p
remembered him. He was an Irishman,
and a Surgeon in the Army, and keptasmali,
apothecary's s:u>;> near Second street and j rj
Market. Some officer in Ou* way's regi-! c
-men: had given oifeuco to o.ie of the citi- n
zens. and Governor Hamilton espoused the
cause of the citizen. This drew forth the c
keen pen of McLean, who defended the of- p.
tieer, and was very severe on the Govern- ^
or. It/was an afihir that created much ex- jt
citcrnent in Philadelphia. I: is barely pes- p
sibie that come iifiht may bo thrown on the u
subject, if the descendants of Governor
Hamilton would examine the papers they
have preserved, and which once were very ^

About this time, (1771.) he wrote a defence u

Considered, however, r.s the production oti

In this light the matter is placed in an article
in the lust number of the Xew York l iveningSaar.
under the signature of II. M. 15.
(II. M. IlaACunxTiiDGE, a gentleman with
whose character and talents our readers arc
well acquainted.) After unmercifully ridiculing
t::e thought of the late President's
imitating or likening himself to Washington,
in this matter of the Farewell Address,
Mr. 15. lets ms into the following piece of
secret his ory. for a continuation of which
noon? probably is possessed of more ample
materials than lie :
Tia; Far-we!] Addrcrs is in all probability
the production of some such father of
Iiis country as Amos Kendall, with just a
sufficient spice? of Jacksonism to give j;
rraisan bfan ee. I Inmw something of these
farewell addresses, having written two of
them for him. The first of those was on
:iic occasion of his taking leave of his coinmaud
in the army. The only pari of it
which was his, was an uncouth mcmoran:lum,
containing some illiberal and ungenlemanly
reflections on a bro-her officer,
who stood high in the esteem of his country,
Gen. l>ii(uvx.) but who in a recent military
ardcr. had been so unfortunate as to speak
with disapprobation of the practice of whip.
>ing in the army: and this was all he con.
ributcd to the address. The paternal adrice
to the young officers, and the line mil.
tary and patriotic feeling which breathed
hroug.h the rest of it, were altogether dra.
nntic. The other State paper was on lis
caving Florida, whore he had displayed his
excessive energy for some months as militlry
and civil governor. 'You know,' said
ic, "what will suit.' Accordingly, I wrote
m address, without a single suggestion from
u'm, and which was signed without a single
lite ration. The add res alluded to was of.en
]uot? d to prove the iiiness of (General Jack>en
for civil Governmcn', to show his cxiltc-ti
love of liberty, and theabsence of dangercus
ambition in his nature. It was highly
.'uJogized as his production. I own I had
>ome design, by contrast, in portraying out
>vhat a government ought to be, to express
ny opinion of what he was."
"The incapaci y of General Jackson has
)ccomeso proverbial, that it would be mere
ifiectation of delicacy to be silent. Mr.
Juan it has declared'that be has no distinct
e'eas on any subject;' and .Mr. Berrien
;cry signilicantly says, 'that which I sign I
vriie;' meaning that Jackson signs that
vhich lie does not write. At the commence,
ncnt of his Administration a pleasant an cdoto
was related to me by one of tiic
:!erks in the Department of State. Gen
iral Jackson, having received a compiimen.

So much for secret History. Tiic conlusion
ot the u'tt.cie of Judge I'rackcnridge,

There is one evidence of the the agency j
of the government in producing the existing j
pressure upon the mercantile community, '
which, we think, cannot h*-mistaken. It is
the fact that it is so palpable, that even the c
cautious spirit of newspaper neutrality has ? c
been forced from its citadel of security and '
impunity, to denounce and deplore it. The
following passage from tiie New York
O I ~
Journal of Commerce, may be cited in j j
proof. There are some of the opinions ot <
the Journal for which we have considera- ; [
' hie respect, although its general course is , (
, not much io our laste. Upon a subject . r
like that now under discussion, it has am
pie means of information, and, when it ven- : (
: tares lo speak out. we may be certain that j <
there is but a trifling difference in public |,
: sentiment. Neutral papers are the true i
echoes of undivided public opinion,
i From the Journal of Commerce. j 1
It is not our practice to be continually i
finding fan!: with the government?at least;r
we do not make a business of it?but when ! *
' we see such a wanton trifling with the in- ' *
, tcrcsts cf commerce, and through it with ji!
! .he pecuniary interests of the whole coun- j
; try ; when we see an attempt to counteract !
the immutable laws of trade by arbitrary j t
; enactments : and when under this 'yranni-' \

; oils friends, s. ripped of the earnings of ma-. ]
i ny yea re, anil subjected to menral anxieties) l
and charges more grievous to be borne I [

this, and witness the portents of the firure, j
