On the 7th day of May the Island of Ilayti
was visited with an earthquake, which, in its!

severest which we havn ever had oh record.? ,

of that day, at about half-past 5 o'clock,

^jn an elevated part of this town, the sky was uncommonly
'serene, and the descending sun
promised to be bright and glorious in its setting
^ ?.just then, casting my eyes towards Mount Isabella?
which overlooks the town?I perceived a
dark vapor ascending and enveloping its base and
sides?a rolling rumbling sound immediately
<jr succeeded; and instantaneously came a shock
which nearly dashed me to*he ground.
The level of the square appeared undulating
like the waves of the sea?a faint and sickly sensation
came over me, and dizziness and difficulty
in breathing. The houses rocked to and fro
tTike vessels in a storm. The ground was rent
in various parts. Many persons were thrown
jdown by the force of the concussion, others were
^S^tei'feeling as in a state of drunkenness. Every
fef?;^^Saioment we expected the earth to open and enus.
A second shock followed, yet stronger
than the former, accompanied by the same ap >pearances,
eflects and terrors. The church a
jstrong??md massive building, seemed tottering to
its fa$ptne bricks flew frtmi the solid masonry
as if from projectiles; wide fissures appeared in

, entirely.constructed of wood,' which alone accounts
for its preservation. The stone build

were entirely destroyed. From the 7th up to
the present date, we have been in a continued
etate of alarirt?upwards of forty shocks having
taken place during that interval, some more or
less severe. Processions and pray err, are continually
on foot, to avert, if possible, tlie Divine

would British philanthropists say of our Southern

them to London or Liverpool, to live upon the

an old infirm negro 6lave, than a white free man?
Is this trade of shipping paupers against their will

The S^mteip not in session to-day.
In the Mr. Gushing offered the following
resol|gt0^ tyhi'ch was agreed to:
Resolved;' That tlie President of the United
States be requested to communicate^) the
House of Representatives, (if in his judgment
the same be compatible with the public interest)
the report of the Commissioners on the $Sfcof

are not yet satisfied.
The Apportionment bill, with amendments
from the Senate, was communicated and laid on
the Speaker's table?
The Speaker announced that the bill for the
adjustment of private claims in Louisiana was
the special order for this day.
jy.i.The House proceeded to the execution of the
border, and spent the day therein.
? 1 have just 6een tetters from commercial men
in New York to members of the House, giving
information as to the state and prospects of .the
loan. Tliey also state that the loan will not be
taken in.Europe, nor here; that strenuous efforts
are making to obtain a part of it in New York
and Boston; thatiWCapitaliats of Europe have
combined against us with a view to force us to
assume the state debts; that the state of the
revenue and of business in New York is bad and
becoming worse; that a tariff will afford no relief;
that goods are exporting from New York,
to get the. drawback, &c.
Yon will find in the Madisonian of this morning
a card:from Mr. Profit, which asserts the
consistency of Mr. Tyler's course on the distribution
subject, and shews that, in the Virginia
legislature, he held the doctrine, as now, that
there should be no distribution if the tariff
should be raised above twenty per cent.
It is very commonly asserted, to-day, that the
President will veto the Extension bill and any
Revenue bill which provides for distribution
while it increases duties beyond the terms of
the Compromise act.
In that case, it is probable that no Revenue
bill will nnss nt this session: that is?that, after;
July 1st, there will be no revenue at all;?for
it is insisted that on the 30th of June, the acts
regulating the collection of duties will expire.
The Madisonian has backed out from the
promise of a reply to Mr. Ewing's statement.
WASHINGTON, JUNE 13.
Mr. Adams, to-day, submitted a resolution,
which was adopted, calling on the President for
copies of the quintuple treaty, relative to the
suppression of the slave trade, together with
copies of Mr. Cass's protest, and of his correspondence
on the subject. Mr Adams' view6 on this
subject will be brought out more at length when
he obtains the necessary information. lie has
already declared that Mr. Cass's interferance
with this subject was improper, and I have reason
to think that the same opinion is entertained
in the Cabinet of Mr. Tyler. ?
This was the day, in course, for the introduction
of resolutions. Many were presented, and
several of them relative to the organization of the
House, its rules, &c.
A motion was made to enforce the Committee
of the Whole to take a vote on any question at
t-kmav" vajnrfmo #1.1
votes by yeas and nays in Committee of the
whole on amendments to the TarifFbill, after the
Committee have sufficiently discussed any amendments.
I think it will yet be adopted, and
that it will be found useful in this particular case.
It will be a very bad arrangement to go on in a
general debate on the Tariff, till the majority of
the House decide to arrest the debate and take
the bill out of Committee. Discussion is necessary
on each particular item of the bill, and this
cannot be had without a new system, by which
the Committee will be compelled to pass from
item to item.
The "nnr. hour rule" was adonted bv a laram
-majority, to be applicable to all debates in the
|3Rousc and the Committee.
jfjpThe Aj-porlionmcnt, Bill, returned from the
Sdnate with amendments, was taken up. The
question was on concurring with the Senate in
their amendments.
Mr. Everett moved the previous question, and
insisted upon it, contrary to the earnest request
of Mr. Adams. The House, however, refused
to second the previous question. Mr. Adams
thanked the House for refusing to apply the gag
to a question which was the most important that
had ever arisen between the two Houses. He
went on to argue in favor of a full representation
and to show that the Senate had no right to interfere
in a matter relating entirely to the organization
of the House. He was for the ratio proposed
by Mr. IJerricn in the Senate, 50,000, and
for the fractional representation. After some
rlolntft tliA fianofn omAiwlmnnf /?li!innrinnr Hio ro_
tio from 50,179 to 70,680, was non-concurred in,
95 to 112.
The Senate, to-dav, was chiefly occupied in
the consideration of private claims. The bill for
the settlement of the accounts of Silas Deane,
after a 'ong debate, was ordered to be engrossed.
The Senate spent some time in Executive session,
engaged chiefly on the nom ination of Mr.
Caldwell, of New-Orleans, as the Superintendent
of the Mint atfbat place. The nomination
was rejected without a division.
WASHINGTON, JUNE 14.
The apportionment bill was again considered
in the House to-day. After the adjournment of
yesterday, the Whig members of the- House had
a consultation on the subject of the ratio, and de
terminfid to take the ratio proposed by the Senate.,
.A number of the Whigs however, dissented,
arid would not come into the measure. The j
motion tovreconsider the vote non-concurring
tho Senate amendment was offered, and&ftj??
House called. Two hundred and fourteen mwjljj
hers were present. The vote was close?
.reconsidering 106, against it, 109. ?
' Tfe^awStipn was then taken on the Senate
amendifflreth ftilowing a representative for each
fraction exceeding half a ratio.
''This was scouted, clamored against, and rejected
almost by acclamation. The vote was
for concurrence"50, against concurrence 161.?
So the bill went bark to the Senate.
Tho vote of the House against the representation
of fractions is too strong to be ehaken.?
But in regard to the ratio, it appears probable
that the House will ultimately yield to the Senate.
;
^The House took up the bill extending the taWr
laws till the 1st of August, and providing
that this shall not prevent the distribution of the
proceeds of the sale of the public lands on the
1st July.
The motion was to strike opt this proviso.?
Mr. \V. Cost Johnson EpWte against strikihg out,
and said that if th?- distribution should be*sue pended,

bill out of Committee to-morrow at 2 o'clock,J
I suppose it will pass both Houses, but I assitfe j i
you that it is extremely probable, to say the ,
least of it, lhat Mr. Tyler will veto it. He will
certainly veto Mr. Fillmore's tariff bill Bhauffi c
it nass with the clause of repealing the prorah t
of the distribution act which suspends that act
in case duties should be increased over tweftty
per cent He had better therefore, save the ^
House the trouble of maturing the big bill, by
vetoing the-little billl
The Senate, this morning, passed the armed 1
occupation of Florida bill to a third reading. An t
abstract of the bill yon will see in the Ma.di.S- \
7?i'an of this morning. It will certainly pass the
House, and the general opinion is that it will
put an end to the Florida war?if it is not ended
?and Mr. Levy says it is ended. *
The Navy appropriation was takqn up, and a 1
motion was made and discussed to strike out the1 (
clause which prevents any part of this or future
appropriations from being applied to the payment
of officers, not now in service, until their -j
number shall be reduced by death, resignation .
or otherwise, to the number that jyas in services .
on the 1st January, 1841. Mr. Evans. Mr. ;
liams, and others debated the question, "mr. ]
W. said the number of officers had increased'in
a manner disproportionate to the increase of the
Navy, and it was necessary to check it But he ^
was willing to take the number in the service on
the 1st of January, 1842, as the standard.?
This was finally, agreed to. But I think the '
Senate is disposed to strike out the v^olo clause. ,
Yesterday being the day for the inauguration of
our Mayor, Col. Seaton, his mansion was thrown
open, and he received the cqngralulations and
respects of the President, the Cabinet, the Foreign
Ministers, Gen. Scott and suit, and the

Great Robbery.?The Louisville Journal of
Monday says:
"There was an atrocious assault and robbery
on Thursday night at the corner of Second and
Walnutstreet8. About twenty, minutes before
one o'clock, a Mr. George W. Bartlett, of St.
'Louis, was attacked by three ruffians, two of
whom held liirn by the arms, while the third rifled
him of 818,000 in bills of exchange on Baltimore,
New York, and Philadelphia, and about
$130 in bank notes. In the struggle that he
made with the robbers, he was 6fabed severely
though not dangerously, in the thigh and arm.
A gentleman in the neighborhood, who subsequently
took the wounded man into his house
and sent for medical aid, says that he heard hi6
cries of distress for at least fifteen minutes before
he went to his assistance. He supposed at first
that the noise probably proceeded form some
drunken rioter. When he arrived at the spot, the
ruffians were gone: and he informed us that a
watchman could not be found for more than an
hour.

MORE INDIAN MURDERS.
The following account of the massacre of a
whole family, but a few days since, on the Suwanee,
cannot be read without a shudder, and a feelI
ing of indignation against those who have the
j management of affairs, who, while they are de
I into a
| false security, are in possession of the strongest
; evidence, that the enemy is stil Unsubdued, not
i sensibly diminished in numbers, and ever ready
' to pounce upon every unguarded point .
On Wednesday 7th in6t., about 2 o'clock in
, tire afternoon, a party of about forty Indians came
| upon the plantation of Capt. Robinson, near the
Sandy Ford, on the Suwanee River. Capt. Robinson's
three sons and a hired man, were ploughing
in a field- They were all simultaneously
fired upon by Indians: three of tho young , men.
were shot dead, the other mortally wounded.
Capt Robinson was at some distance from the
young men, when he first saw the Indians and
heard the report of their rifles, fled towards, his
house; when he approached it, he found another
party of Indians already in the yard, he saw his
wife and daughter, break from the house and
endeavor to escape. Mrs. R. was^ty and fell,
wounded; the daughter was pursu^ by ^n Indian
who caught her by her hair as sh&it^'and cutting
her throat with his knife, draggea her back
to the house, and with her wounded mother she
was thrust within doors and the house fired.?

soon after visited the spot. One of the young
men who was shot in the field, was found still ,
alive, though he did not long survive.
This is the fifth or sixth massacre, in that same
neighborhood, by the same band within a twelve- <

by the commanders of the posts, to dislodge
them. The war on their side, has been long $

The Earthquake at St. Domingo;?A correspondent
of the U. S. Gazette, after detailing
the particulars of the late Earthquake, states that
the country people marched into the city armed
with manchettea, knives and guris, and began the
work of plunder and ^murder,"killing every one
who offered any resistance to their depredations.
They flftt attacked the stores of the white me?v |
chants, all of whom that could, made?for the ship- ^
ping, leaving their property at the mercy of their
"colored brethren," who took possession of every
thing they could lay their hands on. Bands of
eight or ten of the pi undererers woujd meet in
the streets and contend for the spoils, frequently
leaving on the ground one half of their number
dead or wounded. Such a scene, says^the writer,
was scarcely was ever beheld. Beneath
the ruins the cries of the wounded andrdyingfor
succour were heard h$tfain, and iir many-cases
four dayB had elapsed hflfcre any eflhrts eoutjbe
made for their relief. i ' . : ^CoNGREssr?The
bill for the extension of /the
tariff laws till the first of. August waspassed in
the House on the 15th init^tfid will no doubt
r.ass in the Senate.?This bill reoeala the Btfth
section of the distribution act/which section suspends
that act in case the duties be increased *
above 20 per cent. It is generally believed that
the bill will be vetoed by the President?in that
event it ie supposed there will be a'breaking* tip
and re-yrganizatiopj^the Cabinet It is rumored
that the Clajf'twjg&will move anJmfieacbment
against the Pi^dent if he shourd*veto-the *
bill. The House at the latest dates were enga- *
ged in debating the motion to insist upon their 9
disagreement to the Senate's amendment to the ^1
apportionment bill.
Ax Old mcnnener.?A tnan 66 years old,
named Watson, living in Martin County, N,C.
recently killed a poor woman whom he foandin
his orchard gathering plums. On discovering
her, he left his work, went to the house, got his
gnn, and as soon as he was near enough, took
deliberate aim and shot her dead.,. The only rea.
son he assigned for the horrid deed was, that she-,
had conjured him.
The Presidency.?Henry Clay was nominated
for the Presidency, by the Whig Convention
which assembled af-'Milledgevilfe, (Geo.) last *
week.
i The King of Rhode Island has issued a proclamation
offering a reward of 81,000 for the apprehension
and confiment in any jail within-^ds ^
