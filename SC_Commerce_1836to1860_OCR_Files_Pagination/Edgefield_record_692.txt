ok up the bill r the relief of Charles F. IN

pared to report, and said be desired to 8
vad the report himself. Considerable '
-b o was made to this coumse, but the g
gendeman evinced his usual obinsey c
and the opposition was withdrawn. With Cl
portentos aspect, and solemn tone, as If 0
pening the seventh vial of his wrath, he a
:osmenced the reading of the report, and d
seeupied about three quarters of an hour q
in its delivery. There was litde of novel- b
y ni, being mostly the speeches ofBotts, P
Arnold, and his own boiled down, and con- *
sluding with the expression of belief shat a
from the President's abuse of authority a
case has occurred for the exercise of the 0
power conferred on the House of impeach
ment, but from the situation of the coun- g
try. and the circumstances by which they .
were surrounded, it was unadvisable to II
recommend it. The whole matter is there- o
fore referred to the people. and in order di
that the Veto power may be restrained. c
they snhbnit a resolution that Congress re- 1
commend to the State Legislatures an a. ti
medment to the 7th section of the frst m
article, so as to enable a majority of the t
whole number of the House of Congress, t
instead of two thirds, to pass a bill when b
returned with the President's objections. 0
Mr. Gilmner then presented a report by 51
way of a protest do bis own behalf against h
~h
the report of the mauariy. He examined i1
at length and with much ability the pow- t4
er of the louse to institute such a Com- I
mistee, and proved conclusively that they I
bad exceeded their constitutional functions
[a reference to the remedy proposed by the ''
majority, besaid if the Executive Veto was
destroyed, it would still exist in the Judi. 5'

still exist in the people. P
Mr. C. J. Ingersoll rollowed in a report r
on behalf of himself and Mr. Roosevelt, t
in % hich powerful argument, effective sar- C
eas and brilliancy of thought and ex- I
presmon were most happily blended, and I
all parties joined in the merriment exi
ted by the fidelity with whic he was ac- I
quitting himself of his former obligations 1
to the venerable agitator.
The three r wih the Tariff bill, t
and the Veto were ordered to be r
printed, and the whole subject postponed t
until to-muurow. *
Mr. Wirse oved that the House proceed

From the result of she deliberations of a

hat the President has acted constitution

ef6ects in thb body politic and
mral work, which it will require ma
of patient add enduring toil to
cailemities that have been the
of eztensivd individual distress. and
have contributed mainly to the uni
adestruction of private and public
nce', which is so essential to indi
ai or national prosperity.
w li remembered by many of the
as Otbispaper that the years 1836, '37
edstinguished, in this city par
by the most extensive and gi
rations in what was then called
zoaks"-or, by the more signit
6fet more euphonious appellation
dhlautities." Let us glance at the
eperandi by which these -securi
or "representatives of value " were
ad it will throw a little light up
.0oe"tle incipient and most powerful
paoses of the unexampled distress of the
present day. The prolific brain of the
speculator of the period to which we have
aded readily taught him that the spirit
of the age was peculiarly social or incor
porate, and that any species of security
which bore the impress of a corporate seal
with the imposing names or a president
and treasurer, or the equally potent guar
antee of a number of private associates,
men of of soi-distant repute for boundless
estates and extensive financial talent,
could be used to great advantage with the
dredulons and unsuspectig.-For exam
pie : A tract of stony land in a neighbor
tng state, utterly valueless for any purpose
that the ingenuity of man can suggest, is
purchased for a small nomiual considera
tion. The purchaser comes to this city of
humbug and fancies, and represents to his
associates and through them to the com
numnty, that be has procured the mo-t "val
uisle granite quarry in all ehe length and
IreadI of this great Union. An associa
tion is formed, probably with chartered
franchises, an office opened, a president,
directors, secretary, treasurer, and all the
parphenelia, of a respectable community,
with capital ad libitum and inuitituan duly
provided. Next appears a splendid en
graved certificate of stock, handsomely
signed and countersigned by the constitu
ted authorities, and most formidably seal
ed with the corporate seal of the associa
tion. Thus the altar is prepared-bring
forth the victim.
The tried and mercenary agents of this
tapendous fraud are sent abroad through
the country, seeking whom they may de
votv; and, prepared with certificates of
the present value, or certain appreciation
of the worthless stuff, and w ith leters of
introduction or recummen'!ation procured
by fraud or falsehood or rurgery. they con
idealy approach :he unsuspecting land-I
holder, who is moved by desire of change
or pecuniary embarrassment, or probably
i thq very large amount which i6 offerred
to-eschange his valuable property,
piirhaps the happy homestead of his fath
er, or 4h patrimony of his wife, for the
stock of the new corporation. le is false
ly idid that it is amply secured beyond the
possibiity ofoss, by a pledge of real estate
olaimof inestimable value. As the de
glare of the treachercus whill-of-the
b' iles the traveller from the high
0 the neighboring quagmire, so the
glitterng.hoge of ontune lures the utsus
'- aBtsar of the
and est specidiator. The
____ 2 T is signed
of Intrinsic value haa been excbnedfr
that which is utterly worthless, and he
who but yesterday was happy and com
furtable, has been cast upon the world im
poverished and heart-broken by the artful
designs of a band of swindlers. This i
no faney sketch, but a true and faithful
picture -of one of the many dishonest
schemes by whbich the credulous property
holder itr eapitalist has been robbed of his
estate or piilferred of his money.
It is a well known fact that very large
amounts of sucb stocks as are above de
scrihed, were imposed upon the comm un
aity by every species of falsehood and
misrepresentation; that they havo since
proved to have been utterly worthless at
the time of their creation ; and that their
worthless character was well known to'
the official functionaries whose names ap
peared upon the certifeates, and also to
-the agents by whom they were negociated
.Many of the individuals who wero con
corned in these fraudulent schemes were
men of good repute for moral honor and
pecuniary integrity, esteemed for their
pvate virtues, and in many instances;
hoding high placep in the temple of the
God of truth, but their judgements were
warped, their moral sense distorted by
the love of lucre, and they were induced
by dishonest appeals to their cupidity to
sacrigece every noble and manly virtue up
on the altar of the god of Mamtmon.
WVhat has been the natural, the inevita
ble result of these operations ? Let this
question be properly considered and truly
answered, and be that runs may road in
that answer one of the promianent causes
of the present unparalelled distress in eve
rramification of society. The result is
te almost universal destruction of private
ad public confidence, of that "trust in
the goodness of anothier," without which
as a commerrcial nation can ever be prosper
one, no individual or society can ever be
truly happy-The lesson we are taught
by such transactions has been most dearly
paid for, but it inculcates a moral which if
closely treasured and earnestly acted up
on, will under every circumstances pro
duce the most hippy results. We are
taught tat fortune should not be too ea
gerly sought; that to attain the happy gifis
we must travel calmly and slowly through
the toils of our vocatton, and while earn
ing our bread by the sweat of our brow,
bear constantly tn mind that "labor ormnia
osici improbus."

in both branches (with one or t wo excep

Woth Houses were consequently Iri without

The reasons for this important step will
in due time be laid before the public in de
tail it will be demonstrated in the most

not resolved upon this measure, they would
Nave deserved the severest condemnation
af their constituents, as faithless and re

Every effort has been made on the part
of the minority to conciliate the good will
of their opponents and avoid this collision.
They have been anxious, most anxious to
carry out the requirements of the Consti
ition and laws in good faith. They have
shown themselves willing to pass over to
lhe extreme verge of the ground of con
eession and compromise, if they could be
there,met in a corresponding spirit as equals
and peers with rights of their own and the
rights of others to preserve. lut such was
not the will of the majority. Exulting in
the present possession of power, obtained
by accident, and which they expect to lose,
they had formed the daring plot of perpet
unting their influence in the national coun
oils by the perpetration of a deliberate and
odious fraud, which struck at the funda
mental principlesofall free Government,
and sought to overturn and reverse all those
maxims of wisdom, truth, and justice, upon
which rests the whole superstructure of our
republican institutions.
