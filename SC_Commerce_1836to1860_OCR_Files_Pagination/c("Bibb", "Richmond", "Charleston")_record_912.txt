Threat’ning to overwhelm ;
• The billows rise, and fall, and break,
And stoutest hearts begin to quake;
The pilot leaves the helm.

Slept one who since “laid down his life”

To save them from earth’s care and grief,

They said no more:

And instant o’er the waters spread
A calm from shore to shore.

And peace and hope are riven—

* BUCKSISH AND KORBASH."
Our journey from Gaza to Khan Yunez, was
only four and-a-halfto five hours long. Arriv
ing there, I paid my guards a dollar each for
their brief service, and they had not the hardi
hood to ask for more. But, as I have in another
v' place intimated, they are never content (the peo
i pie in this country) as long as they think they
can get more. Their importunities are eternal.
You never cease to hear the cry of buckshish,
from the time that you go to the East, till the
X moment that you leave it. It is rung in your
ears all day long—pay what you may—make
whal contract you may, after payment is made,
' and the contract is completed,'the butkshish must
be foithcoming. There is no a voiding this pay
ment of buckshish ; but a traveller learns a way
* to moderate the demand. He may begin, as 1
did, in Beyrout, by paying seven persons who
had aided me to get on, whose services I was
not in need of, and had not required; but he
will commit this fault but once, unless he wishes
to be charged v\ ith extreme simplicity. Let a
man’s piety, his gentleness of disposition, bis
pliability to circumstances be what the^ may,
he will end, as all travellers do, and must end,
by resisting these demands, to some extent, and
by driving away all supplicants who have no
• claim,, with the korbasb, which is an article that
ought to be made of the hide of a hippopotamus,
though sometimes it is of an inferior substance.
It comes to the korbash at last, whatever sympa
thy and misiaktn philanthropy may have
suggested to the unhappy sufferer in the interim.
It is the heavy buiden of a traveller’s existence,
this pertinacious cry for buckshish which it
may do for every one to know, nothing but the
korbash will ever satisfy. The very recollec
tion of it while I write is keenly painful, and
more than a thousand and one are the Eastern
stories which any half dozen travellers in that
region can recount, if they detail all their expe
rience on the subject. But I come now to a
demand extraordinary—a compulsory matter—
where bucksish was demanded nolens volens.—
I had paid my soldiers for four and-a-half hours
as much as we had paid our guards elsewhere
for a long day's service. They returned in
Governor, who,acting as spokesman for them,
told me that I would have to pay them two hun
dred piasters, or ten dollars. Of course, I un
derstood this well; but the impudence of the de
mand was so great that I forgot my prudence.
The Governor was accompanied by some dozen
or fifteen Arabs and Turks, who had formed a
circle around me. I thrust them aside, and went
to my carpet-bag, and drew out the Sultan’s fir
man—a document about three feet long, bv two
about thiity minutes
and-a-htilt wide, ihis 1 unrolled before the
Governor. I had not had occasion to resort to
it before. I also showed another large docu
ment—an order of the Department of the interior
at Constantinople, to the like of him, to furnish
me horses, oud promote my wishes in every way,
on pain of removal. I then told him that 1 had
given the men twice as much as they deserved or
as was customary. 1 asked him if he was not
ashamed to come begging money, and threatening
to extort it. I called him a vagabond, and con
temptible creature, and unfit to occupy his post -
and told him that he should not have one para -
and that before L would accede to his impertinent
demand, I would go to Constantinople, and have
him removed ; and that 1 pledged myself to pro
cure bis removal, if he did not take himself away.
Luigi, whose indignation was as great as mine,
and who was well acquainted with the impor
tance of assuming the “ Cambyces vein!' occa
sionally, translated all I said i have no doubt,
faithfully—and by way of expletive threw in a
tremendous lie of bis own manufacture, to the
effect that I iiad travelled all the way from Con
stantinople—i^it I was a personage of conse
quence, and that I had never paid a guard more
than fifteen piastres for one day's services. The
effect of our joint eloquence, and of my passports,
was electrical. The Governor and his crew
slunk away. He himself, returned in the even
ing to ask fora spermaceti candle, which I gave
him, and which was but the second one he had
ever seen. We were foi lunate in finding lodg
ings for the night in the porch of a mosque, on
tb$second story—the only place perhaps, in the
-village fiec from dirt ’ The minaret of the mos
que rose close along side of us. Several tall
palms were waving in the evening breeze, near
ny, and the full moon rising soou after sunset,
added to the beauty of the scene.-—Cerrnptnd

OUR NATIONAL NAME.
We aee it proposed by a committee of the
New York Historical Society, to change our :
national name to “ Alleghania. Were such a j
thing practicable, the question might arise how ;
far it would be consistent to recommend such an
alteration, in the face of the title recognised by]
the national constitution. The old confedera
tion was styled “the United States of!
America,” and the name is incorporated in the ]
present constitution. The question was, doubt- j
less, considered by our revolutionary fathers,!
and in our humble opinion, they decided wisely.
In the formation of new towns, counties, or
States, no objection can be taken to the selection j
of aboriginal names, provided it be done with
moderation, taste, and discretion, but this war
against names which have grown old, have been
long sanctioned by usage and law, and been ren
dered almost sacred by historical incident, strikes
us as rather disorderly.
Names have another use and value besides the
gratification of fancy. They frequently have a
historical connexion, which good sense and at
tachment to old things teach us not to break or
disturb. Of course, almost any eupboneous In
dian name is preferable to the “ Ciceros, Livys,
Uticas, and Syracuscs," with which we have
been afflicted, but we have already a very fair
proportion of aboriginal appellations, without
proceding to the extreme of making the Indian
nomenclature universal. Whatever may bo
said for example, of Georgia, Louisiana, Penn
sylvania, Maryland, Virginia, Delaware, New
Jersey, &c., &.C., and of Boston, New York,
Albany, Baltimore, New Orleans. &c., they are
all denominations which recall points of interest
in our history,and are indicative of our origin
as a nation. Should the Indo-mania prevail,
however, some future historian, judging from
our national nomenclature, might be induced to
suppose we were descended from the native tribes
of the Continent.
The derivation of names affords room for
curious research, and their corruption is often
effected after an amusing mode. Thus a little
town in Illinois, called Joliet, from the Jesuit
Missionary of that name, by a wrong pronuncia
tion, became converted into Juliette, and to relieve
the solitude of Juliette, a neighboring town was
denominated Romeo. jEsopus in Kingston, a
village on the banks of the Hudson, was origi
nally called Esepes, from an Indian root, signi
fying river, but some wise-acre, presuming that
the name of the old fable-writer bad been sadly
corrupted, undertook to restore it, in its purity,
and deiived a Greek name from an aboriginal
word. The less such matters are tampered with,
the better, we believe. Changes in thp appella
tives long established, produce confusion, and
lend to destroy the landmarks of History. The
rage for innovation should find other objects. If
new names are to be conferred, let them be be
stowed on new things, but let tradition and time
honoured* usage remain undisturbed.
CUTTING SARCASM.
We have read with considerable interest an
article from Jerold’s Magazine, written by a pro
fessed “Philanthropist," proposing “the only
remedy for the miseries of the English poor.
With very great show of reason, and many a
moving figure of speech, he proposes to enslave
the lower orders in England, in order to insure
them a suitable maintenance. The picture
which he draws of some of the bitter effects of
poverty, witnessed by himself, is certainly very
affecting. We give a sample.—N. Y.Bapt. Ad.
“ It is not necessary to recapitulate the horrors
I have witness^ d in the regions of poverty. It
is said that the eras of pestilence and famine are
passed ; but so will not those say who have
visited the dwellings of the operatives of our
great manufacturing towns, when the markets
are glutted and the mills and manufactoiies are
closed. Pestilence still rages fiercely as ever,
in the form of typhus, engendered by want. In
the mission I have called myself to, 1 have
stood upon the mud floor, over the corpse of the
mother and the new-born child—both the vic
tims of want. I have seen a man (God’s im-1
age) stretched on straw, wrapped only in a mat, i
resign his breath, from starvation, in the prime 1
of age. I have entered on a sultry summer’s !
night, a small house, situate on the banks of a ;
common sewer, wherein one hundred and
twenty-seven human beings, of both sexes and
all ages, were indiscriminately crotvdtd. I have
been in the pestilential hovels of our great man
ufacturing cites, where life was corrupted in
every possible mode, from the malaria of the
sewer to the poison of the gin-bottle. I have
been in sheds of the peasant, worse than the \
hovel of the Russian, where eight squalid, dirty, I
boorish creatures, were to be kept alive by eight
shillings per week, irregularly paid. I have j
seen the father snatch the bread" from his child,
and the mother offer the gin-bottle for the breast.
I have seen, too, generous sacrifices and tender
considerations, to which the boasted chivalries
of Sydney and Edward were childish ostenta
tion. I have found wrong so exalted, and right
so debased—I have seen and known of so much
misery, that the faith in good has shivered within
me."
DR. JOHNSON.
During his. last illness, his dread of death
was for a time very great, but at length, through
a humble trust in the Redeemer, his fears subsi
ded, and he said, “ The bitterness of death is
past." After he had found ppace in believing
ne sent for Sir Josnua Reynolds, to beg as a dy
ing friend, three favors of him:—First, that he
would never paint on the Sabbath; second, that
he would relinquish to him thirty pounds, which
would enable him to leave that sum to a distress
ed family; third, that he would often read the
Scripturts, and always on the Lord’s day. With
all which, it is said, Sir Joshua complied.
In his last hours, Johnson said to his physi
cian,—« Dr. Brocklesby, you are a worthy
man, and my friend; but 1 am afraid you are no
Christian. What can I do better for you than
offer up in your piesence a prayer to the Great
God, that you may become a Christian in every
sense of the word?" He fell on his knees and
prayed ; but rising up he took the Doctor’s hand
and said, “Doctor, you do not say, Amen!”
The Doctor then said “Amen.” Johnson con
tinued, “My dear Doctor, believe a dying man
there is no salvation but in the sacrifice of the
Lamb of God." J
As Hume, in his last hours, had made a bold
declaration of his infidel opinions, Johnson was
desired, in like circumstances, to make a confes
sion of his faith. Seizing his pen, and enquir
ing wbat was the usual form of commencing a
will, he wrote,—“1 offer my soul to the great
and merciful God; 1 offer it full of pollution,
but injull assurance that it will be cleansed in
the blood of the Redeemer.” Having written
for some minutes, he expressed something of his
| former dread ol death. Sir John Ilawkins, who
was present, replied, “ If you, Doctor, have these
fears, what is to become of me and others?” “O,
sir,” said he , “I have written piously it is true,
but I have lived too much like other men.” He
now claimed no merit: he hod in common with
all others, violated Heaven's righteous law and
could find no peace, no hope, but in humble
penitence and cordial trust in the atoning Sa
viour.
THE EMPEROR OF CHINA.
The first interview held by Lord Macartney,
in the earliest embassy sent by England to Chi
na,in 1792, is thus described.
Soon after daylight the approach of the em
peror was announced by music. He soon ap
peared from behind a high mountain skirted
with trees, as if from a sacred grove, preceded
by a number of men employed in proclaiming
aloud his virtues and his power. He was seat
ed in an open chair, or triumphal car, borne by
sixteen men, and followed by guards, officers of
the household, flag and umbrella bearers, and
music. He was dressed in plain dark silk, with
a velvet bonnet, not much different in shape
from that worn by the Scotch Highlanders; a
large pearl in the front of it was the only orna
ment about his person. Lord Macartney and
Sir George Staunton, the principal performers
in the English part of the ceremony, attired
themselves for the occasion somewhat in con
formity with Chinese notions of propriety. His
lordship wore the broad mantle and decorations
of the Order of the Bath, and Sir George wore
the scarlet gown of an honorary doctor of laws
of Oxford. On the approach of the emperor the
gentlemen of the embassy came forth from
their tent and knelt on one knee as he passed,
while the Chinese made their usual prostrations.
As soon as the emperor was seated on his
throne the ambassador advanced, holding be
tween both hands, lifted above his head, the
magnificent gold box, adorned with jewels,
which contained the king of England’s letter to
the emperor. In this manner, says the ambas
sador himself, 1 I walked deliberately up, and,
ascending the steps of the throne, delivered it
into the emperor’s own hands, who, having re
ceived it, passed it to the minister, by whom it
was placed on the cushion. He then gave me,
as the first present from him to his majesty, the
eu-shee, a sy mbol of peace and prosperity, and
expressed his hopes that my sovereign and he
should always live in good correspondence and
amity. It is a whitish agate looking stone, per
haps serpentine, about a foot and a half long,
curiously carved and highly prized by the Chi
nese ; but to me it does not appear in itself to be
of any great value.’
A BEAUTIFUL METEOR.
BY REV. HENRY MELVILLE.
Stope is a beautiful meteor; like the rainbow,
it is riot only lovely because of its seven rich and
radiant stripes, it is the memorial of a covenant
entered into between man and his Maker, telling
us we were born for immortality, destined, unless
we sepulchre our greatness, to the highest hon
our and noblest happiness. Hope proves man
deathless ; it is the struggle of the soul breaking
loose from what is perishable, and attesting her
eternity; and when the eye of the mind is
turned upon Christ delivered for our offences,
and raised again for our justification, the unsub
stantial and deceitful character is taken away
from hope. Hope is one of the prime pieces of
that armor of proof in which the believer is ar
rayed; for Paul tells us to take for an helmet
the hope of salvation. It is not good that a man
hope for wealth, since “ riches profit not in the
day of wrath and it is not good that we hope for
human honors, since the mean and mighty go
down to the same burial. But it is good that he
hopes for salvation. The meteor then gathers
like a golden halo round his head, and as he
presses forward in tlje battle-time, no weapon of
the evil one can pierce through that helmet. It
is good, th( n, that he hope; it is good, also, that
he hope; it is good, also, that he quietly wait.
There is much promised in Scripture to the wait
ing upon God. Men wish an immediate ans
wer to prayer, and think themselves forgotten
unless the reply be instantaneous. It is a great
mistake.—The delay is often part, and a great
part, of the answer. It exercises faith, and hope,
and patience; and what better thing con be done
for us than strengthening those graces to whose
growth shall be proportioned the splendors of
immortality 1 It is good, then, that ye wait.
“They that wait on the Lord shall renew their
strength ; they shall mount up with wings as
eagles; they shall run and not be weary, and
they shall walk and not faint."
ISLAND OP PATMOS.
This is an Island of the Archipelago, now
called Patino, situated on the coast of Natolia,
between the isles of Samos and Nicaria. It
is twenty miles in circumference ; and being one
of the most barren heaps of rocks in the Archi
pelago, it might have continued forever unno
ticed, but for the book of Revelation which St.
John composed here. A few valleys only are
capable of some cultivation. It abounds, how
ever, with partridges, rabbits, quails, turtles,
pigeons and snipes. In the midst of the Island
is a mountain, terminated by the convent of St.
John, which, with its iriegular towers and mas
sy appearance, might well be imagined a citadel.
The inhabitants of this convent are in reality
the sovereigns of the country; but their domains
would be insufficient for their maintenance,
were it not for the possession of some lands in
the neighboring isles, and the certain tribute
they derive from the superstition of the Greeks.
These monks, called Caloyers, are spread over
all Greece. Scarce any of them can read, and
yet they all understand how far the empire of
superstition can extend over ignorant minds.
They keep their credulous countrymen in the
most absolute subjection. The hermitage of the
Apocalypse is s'tuate on the declivity of a moun
tain, between the convent and the port of Scala.
It leads to the church of the Apocalypse, which
is built against a grotto in the rocks; and, if we
may believe the inhabitants, was the asylum of
St. John, during his exile at Patmos. Here,
they say, he wrote the book of Revelation ;—and
they pretend to show the very chinks in the
rocks, through which the Holy Spirit breathed
his inspiration. The fragments of this rock
they affirm to be a certain specific against evil
spirits. The Greek monks vend this remedy as
well as the absolutions. The women of Patmos
are generally pretty, but they disfigure themselves
by the excessive use of paint. Long. 26 24 E.,

WHOLESALE SLAUGHTER OF WITCH
ES.
During the seventeenth century 40,000 per
sons are said to have been put to death for witch
craft alone, in Scotland the number was pro
bably, in propoition to the population, much
greater; for it is certain that even in the last
ioity years of the sixteenth century, the execu
tions were not fewer than 17,000. In 1734 the
madness may be said to have reached its highest
pitch; for in that year occurred the celebrated
cate of the Lancashire witches, in which eight
innocent persons were deprived of their lives by
the incoherent falsehoods of a mischievous ur
chin. The civil war, far from suspending the
persecutions,seems, if possible, to have redoubled
it. In 1644-45, the infamous Matthew Hopkins
was able to earn a comfortable subsistence by
the profession of witch-finder, which he exorcis
ed, not indeed without occasional suspicion, but
still with general success. And even twenty
years later, the delusion was still sanctioned by
the most venerable name of the English law;
for it was in 1644 that the excellent Sir Matthew
Hale, after a trial conducted with his usual good
sense, condemned two women to death as witch
es, both of whom were executed accordingly.—

SMOKING HAMS.
No part of a swine is more valuable, or furnishes
better eating than the ham; but the value of this
article is very frequently destroyed, by the injudi
cious manner in which the essential process of
smoking is performed. So far as our experience
extends the best pickel for hams is the one pub
lished in a late number of the Germantown Tele
graph; but the best pickel in the world will not
make good hams, unless proper care is paid to
the smoking. The great difficulty in smoking
hams lies in their not being kept free from all
moisture while in the smoke house. Eight
times out of ten, if hams are examined at the time,
they will will be found to be wet with condensed
vapor, sometimes to such a degree, as to have it
drop copiously from them, and when such is the
case the ham acquires a bad taste, as if it had
been dipped in pyroligneous acid, and is unfit for
eating. The cause of this is to be sought in the
facts that the smoke house is usually too low,
bringing the meattoo near the fire: and that there
is no vent for the steam-like vapor in the upper
part of the building, by which it can escape, and
thus its condensation on the hams be prevented.
The celebrated Westphalian hams are smoked
in the upper chambers of four story buildings,
! and the fires that supply the smoke are kept in
the cellars. The vapor is condensed in the pas
sage, and the hams are always cool and dry.
Heating hams in smoking them, is clearly inju-1
rious, and should be carefully avoided, as
should all moisture. Proper attention to these
points will insure a good article, where the pre
liminary steps of pickling have been well con
ducted.—Germantown Telegraph.
NUTRITIVE QUALITIES OF TEA.
M. Peligot states that tea contains essential
principles of nutrition far exceeding in impor
tance its stimulating properties ; and shows that
as a stimulant, tea is in every respect the most
desirable object of habitual use, as compared
with those of soup, he was by no means in favor
the latter. The most remarkable products of
tea are: 1st, the tannin or astringent property;
2d, an essential oil to which it owes its aroma,
and which has a great influence on its price in
commerce; and 3d, a substance rich in cazote,
crystallizable, called theine, which is also met
in coffee and is called cafeine. Independent
ly of those three substances, there are eleven
others of less importance, which enter more or
less into the constitution of all the kinds import
ed into Europe. What was more essential, as
regards the chemical and hygienic character of
the plant, was to ascertain the exact proportion
of the azotized principle it contains. M. Peligot
| began by determining the total amount of azote
j in tea, and finished by finding that it was from
j 20 to 30 per cent, greater than in any kind of
| vegetable. M. Peligot slates that by reason of
this quantity of azote, and the existence of cafeine
{in the tea leaf, it is a true aliment

A TREE IN BLOSSOM.
Here is a tree overladen with blossoms. It is
| not possible that all these should prosper: one

j growth. I do not love to see a state of infancy

; faculty starves another, and leaves the mind at
j last sapless and barren. As therefore, we usual
j ly pull off some of the superfluous blossoms, that
i the rest may thrive, so it is good wisdom to
| moderate the early excess of the parts or pro
gress ot over-forward childhood. Neither is it
otherwise in our Christian profession A sud
den and lavish ostentation of grace may fill the
eye with wonder, and the mouth will talk ; but
it will not at the last fill the lap with fruits. Let
tne not promise too much, nor raise too high
expectations of any undertakings. I would rath

THE DAISY.
Not worlds on worlds, in phalanx deep
Need we to prove a God is here;
The Daisy, fresh from nature’s sleep,
Tells of his hand in lines as clear.
For who but He who arch’d the skies,
And pours the day-spring’s living flood;
Wondrous alike in all he tries,
Could raise the Daisy’s purple bud 1
Would its green cup, its ivory stein,
Its fringed border nicely spin,
And cut the gold-embossed gem
That, set in silver, gleams within I
And fling it, unrestrained and free,
O’er hill and dale, and desert sod,
That ma t, where’er he walks, may see
In every step the stamp of God.

CHILDREN.
THE BIBLE BOY.
TAKEN CAPTIVE BT THE INDIANS.
Far out in the Western country, there once
livid a little boy whose name was Joseph
Reed. The house in which be resided with
his parents was at a great distance from any
lettlement, and so they had no opportunity of I
lending Joseph to school. His mother, now- I
;ver, taught him to read from an old apelling .
300k, and when he had read thatthrough there i
A’as no other book in the house for him to Me, i
jut the Bible. He could not get Sunday-school
jooks. for at that time there ware no Sunday
ichoois near where he lived, and it was not of
nuch use for him to borow of the neighbors, for
hey had no greater variety than he could find
it home. You may perhaps think that Joseph
must surely grow up very ignorant. Well, we '
shall see.
Joseph was a very thoughtful boy, and very
fond of reading ; so every evening, after he had
been working in the woods with his father all
day, he would take the great Bible from the little
[able in the corner, and sit down to read. From
[he very first he felt much interested in the
beautilul stories of which the Bible contains such
a number. He read over many times the his
tory of Joseph, with which I hope you are all
well acquainted. It is found, you know, in the
book of Genesis, beginning at the 37th chapter.
Then the story of Samuel pleased him so much
that he thought he could never get tired of it;
and so it continued to be with all the beautiful
narratives of the Old Testament, until he had
read it through. But when he came to the his
tory of Jesus, in the New Testament, he was
more than ever interested. He read about his
being a little infant, so poor that he had nothing
but a manger to lie in, and straw for his bed;
and then about his living in the city of Nazareth,
and being obedient to his parents until he became
a man ; then he read that he went about preach
ing to people, and trying to teach them to do
right; curing all the sick people that were
brought to him, raising dead brothers, and sons,
and daughters to life, that they might still be
comlortsto their friends; blessing little children,
and showing by his actions that he loved every I
body, and Joseph thought “surely every body:
must love him." But instead of this he found j
that wicked men hated him, and at last, when
they got him in their power, killed him in a
most cruel manner. Joseph wondered at first
that God would allow so great a sorrow to come
upon one, who never m his life did anything
wrong, and who came from heaven on purpose
to do good ; but as he read still further he found
that all these sufferings were permitted in order
that he might atone for our sins. He read that
“He was wounded for our transgressions, he
was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement
of our peace was upon him and by his stripes
we are healed.” When Joseph understood this,
he said to himself, “O how much I ought to love
this kind Saviour, who my Bible tells me is now
in heaven. But do I love him 1 I am afraid
not, for, if I did, I know I should love to pray
to him, and yet, how often have I gone to bed,
after just hurrying over hastily the prayers my
mother has taught me, almost wishing I had
never known them, so that I might be able to go
to sleep without the trouble of saying them.
And then my temper, I know has not been such
as the gentle Saviour would approve; for often
have I indulged in anger, impatience and dis
obedience to my parents” As these thoughts
passed in Joseph’s mind they made him very sad,
and for several days he could not enjoy pleasure
in any thing. But at length he remembered
that Jesus had said, “ Him that cometh unto me
I will in nowise cast out,” and so he went all
j alone to his own little room in the garret, nnd
jthere kneeling down confessed his sins to God,
i and asked him, for the sake of Jesus who died
j for sinners, to forgive him, and give him a new
I heart that should love to serve God and pray to
Him. His prayer was heard—Joseph felt that
his heavy load of sin was gone, and that now, in
stead of its being a task to pray and praise God,
it was his greatest pleasure.
When Joseph was about 14 years old, his
i father and mother had occasion to go to a distant
! village upon some important business, and he
j was left entirely alone. The nearest neighbour
i lived a mile off, so that there was not a house or
1 person within sight or hearing, and his parents
did not expect to return till late at night. Joseph,
howqper, busied himself, very cheerfully, for
some hours, in splitting wood and piling it
under the little shed ready for winter; for it was
late in October. When he had finished his
work, he, as usual, took the Bible in his hand
and sat down just by the little window which
looked towards the road. Before he opened the
book, he raised his heart in prayer to God that
the Holy Spirit might help him to understand
what he read. He had just finished his short
prayer and was opening the book, when a
strange, loud cry startled him, and looking to
wards the woodson the opposite side of the road,
he saw a party of Indians, about 8 or 10 in num
ber, just coming from among the trees. Joseph
had heard that the Indians, had lately been doin«
some mischief among the white people a few
miles off; but his parents thought the difficulty
would be easily settled without further iniurv
and so, did not imagine any danger from them.
But here they were, right upon Joseph. He
saw by their wardress and weapons that they
came as enemies; and at first he thought he
would run away, but he saw in a moment that
this would be impossible; he could not hide, for
there was no safe place, and it was useless to try
to defend himself; so he made up his mind like
a brave boy, to meet them with a fearless face,
and if they wanted anything from the house
to let them take it, hoping they might then go
away without further mischief. The Indians
burst rudely in at the door, looked all around
and seeing no one but a boy, went into every
other part of the house. Finding, at last that
he was the only person on the premises, they
took all the provisions and clothing they wished,
and then, giving Joseph to understand that he
must go with them, they prepared to leave. Jo
seph knew it was of no use to resist, and so com
mending himself to the protection of God, he
walked courageously along between the two In
dians who were appointed to guard him. The
sun was near setting when they entered the
woods, but the party marched on without stop
ping for several hours, and when at length they
halted, Joseph was still closely guarded. They,
however, allowed him to lie down on some dried
leaves near to the fire, and after a fervent prayer
he fell asleep. For many days they marched
on, until at last they came to a small Indian vil
lage. Here they left Joseph, who by this time
had become so wearied as to be hardly able to
walk. One of the men who had guarded him
all the way remained with him, and took him to
a wigwam which Josephsoon found washisown.
When Joseph awoke the morning after arriving
here, he felt so ill that he could not rise from the
buffalo skin on which he had slept. No one
took much notice of him, however, for some time;
but at last a boy about his own age, the son of the
Indian who owned the wigwam, came and spoke
a few words to him in English. It was the first
time he had heard a word he could understat'd
since he had left home, and the tears came into
his eyes as he told the Indian how sick he felt.
The heart of the youthful savage seemed to be
touched, and he immediately prepared for him j
some medicine, 4tTch as is commonly used by
the Indians. Joseph soon began to feel better,
and in a few days he was so well that the In
dians set him to work cutting and biinging from
he forfe large piles of wood for their wigwam
ires, guarding him very closely all tha time,
oaeph look every opportunity L* could get of
onveraing with the young Indian, who haa been
io kind to him, and whose name he found was
Light Foot, m called by his tribe on account of
iis> swiftness in running. Light Foot had learn
ed to speak the English language of some tra
lers, who had been among the Indians a few
years before. Joseph could not help feeling a
strong desire that this new friend of bia might
mow something about that Saviour who now, in
riisdays of loneliness and affliction, was more
firecious than ever to him. He therefore began
tonversing with his young friend about the true
God of whom Light Foot had before been entire
ly ignorant. Joseph’s intimate acquaintance
with the Bible was now of unspeakable service;
he would repeat to Light Foot whole chapters of
he holy book, explaining them as he went along
n the most interesting manner.
For a long time Light Foot did not care much
ibout hearing these things, and would try to
stop Joseph by laughing at him, telling him at
the same time, in his curious, broken English,
that his name ought to he “Bible Boy," because
lie was always talking about the Bible. But
Joseph still persevered in his endeavors to do
good to Light Foot, praying constantly for God’s
blessing upon what he said. Thus he Jived all
that winter, when, one morning, early in the
spring, Light Foot told Joseph that his father
intended taking him as a white prisoner to anoth
er Indian village at a great distance; and Light
Foot said be feared, when they got him there
they would treat him very cruelly, perhaps put
him to death. Joseph knew that his life was in
the hands of God, and if the Indians killed him
he hoped through the merits of Jesus the Sa
viour to enter heaven, but still he knew that it
was right for him to try to escape from the sava
ges. Light Foot persuaded his father to let him
go with the party on their journey, and without
suspecting that he wanted to help Joseph he
consented. When they had been on their way
two or three days, Light Foot contrived very se
cretly to tell Joseph that he had discovered from
the conversation ol two ot the Indians, that they
were passing within a few miles of the village,
where Joseph had told him his father and moth
er were gone at the time he was taken from
home. The two boys together contrived a plan
by which Joseph might escape that night. It
was not so hard for them to succeed in this way
as you may think it would be, for Joseph had
lately appeared quite contented among the In
dians, and as they did not suppose either he or
Light Foot had the least suspicion of the design
of their journey, they did not guard him very
closely. When the time came for the Indians to
goto sleep around their fires, as usual, Light
Foot laid down not far from Joseph, and when
he was quite sure they were all sleeping sound
ly, he raised his head and motioned Joseph to
go. Joseph arose softly and in a minute disap
peared among the trees. He walked as fast as
he could for several hours, and when morning
came crept into a thicket, of underwood and
slept for some time. When he awoke he felt
much refreshed, and kneeling down he thanked
God who had delivered him out of the hands of
his enemies, and prayed Him to direct and take
care of him on his way to his friends. During
that day and part of the nest, Joseph travelled
on, keeping as near as he could judge, in the di
rection Light Fool had pointed out. At length
in the afternoon of the second day, he came with
in sight of a village. When he reached the
main street he found it was the place he was
seeking, for he had once been there with his
father, about two years before, to visit an uncle
who resided there. Joseph soon found his uncle’s
house and knocked at the door just as the fami
ly were sitting down to supper. They all knew
Joseph, and were much surprised and pleased
to see him. They told him that when his father
| and mother got home, on the night of the day in
j which the Indians bad taken him, and found
| their house robbedand Joseph gone, they feared
i that he had been murdered. They tried in eve
! ry way to find out something about him, but
were at last obliged to give hitn up for lost. Jo
| seph was so worn out with travelling and hard
I ships that he was obligid to stay at his uncle’s a
| few days When at length he reached home
j his meeting with his father and mother was a
most joyful one. Nearly the first thing Joseph
did after embracing his parents was to look
round for the old Bible. It lay in its accustom
ed place, and as Joseph took it once more in his
hands he told his parents how precious its con
tents had been to him while far from home
among savages, and how muen he wished he
could have told all of them, as he did Light
Foot, of the Saviour it revealed.
During the few days that Joseph had staid at
his uncle's the family had all become much in
terested in him on account of his amiable con
duct and courteous manners. They were sur
prised that one who had never enjoyed the or
dinary advantages of school and soci. ty should
appear so intelligent. They never had seen be
fore how a well-studied Bible can make amends
for the absence of all other books.
josepns uncie was so mucn pleased with him
that he made a journey on purpose to persuade
his father to let him come and live with him in
the village, promising to give him such an edu
cation as would enable him to conduct business
and to provide for him a suitable situation. Jo
seph’s father consented and he returned with his
uncle. He had been in the village nearly a year
when one day, while alone in his uncle’s store a
young Indian walked in and stood before him.
Joseph knew him in a moment—it was Light
Foot. After a very friendly salutation, he told
Joseph that he had never been able to forget what
he had told him about that wonderful book which
he called the Bible. He had sought out Joseph
to#ask him if he would not tell him still more
about it, and, if possible, teach him to read it.
Joseph gladly consented to do all that he could
for him and told his uncle all about him. His
uncle was much interested in Light Foot and
said, that if he would split wood, and do other
useful work for him, he might board at hi3 house
and go to the village school. Light Foot was
very grateful, and by faithful industry soon learn
ed to read for himself, the precious book which
had so much interested him. As time passed on
he gave evidence that he had felt himself a sin
ner, and had fled to Jesus for salvation. He nev
er appeared happier than when studying the Bi
ble with Joseph, and in the course of a few years
went back to his own people, the Indians, as a’
missionary, and was the means, by the blessing
of God, of leading many among them to “ know
God, and Jesus Christ whom he has sent.”
In the mean time Joseph, who had become a
prosperous merchant, was busily engaged in pro
moting the interest of the Sabbath-school in the
village, and also in establishing others in the
country around. When asked why he felt so
much attached to this institution, he would say
“Because it is designed to encourage and pro
mote the study of a book, to which I owe all my
happiness and prosperity in this world, as well
as ail my hopes of salvation in the next,_a boob
which, if faithfully studied, would banish igno^
ranee and wickedness from the world ; and fill
it with light and peace of Heaven j that book is
the Bulb.”
