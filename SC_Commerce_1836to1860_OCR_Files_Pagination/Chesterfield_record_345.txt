voices, the friends of the system would

One of the most striking features of the
system its tendeocy to increase. L> t it be
once recognised, and let the mos' moderate
duties be laid for protection ; but put the
system in motion, and its course would be
onward, onward, by an irresistible impulse,
as I shall presently show, from past experience
; and hence the necessity of vigilance,
and a determined resistance to every course
of policy that may by possibility lead to
its renewal. This tendency to increase,
results from causes inherent and insepnra

by the fact, that every tariff for protection
has Invariably disappointed its friends in the
protection anticipated, and has been followed
periodically, after short intervals, by a demand
for another lanff with increased duties,to
afford the protectien vainly anticipated
from its predecessor. Such has been the
result throughout, from 1316 to 1828, when
the first and last protective tariffs were laid,
which I propose now to show by a very
brief historical sketch of the rise and progress
of the system.
The late war, *i.h the embargo, and oth.
er restrictive measures that preceded it, almost
expelled our commerce from the
ocean, anifdiverted a vast amount of capital,
- that had been employed in it, to manufactures.
Such was the cause that led to the
system. After the termination of the wur,
there was, on th^part of Congress and the
country, the kindest feed big toward the manufacturing
interest, accompanied by a
strong desire so to adjust the duties (iadis
pensable to meet the expenses of Government,
and to pay the public debt) ns to aL
ford them ample protection. ! he matiu
factum* were consulted, and the net of116
was modelled to their wishes. They regarded
it at affording sufficient and permanent
protection, and I, in my ihen waul of
experience as to the na;uro of the system,
did not dream that we-would hear any more
oTtariff, tHJ it would become necessary to
* k readjust the duties. after tiic discharge of
bflic -debt. Vaio expectation 1 Two
year# bad not pissed away before the manufacturers
were n* clamorous aa ever for
additional protection ; and to meet their
wishes, new duties were lard, from time to
time, with tite same result; bu* the clamor
stiH returned, till 1824, when the tariff of
that year pasted, which was believed on all
Bides to be ample, and was coos'dtffvd, like
* that ef 'M, to be a final adjustment of the
question. It was under this impression 1
" that the South acquiesced (reluctandy) in 1
the very high duties jt imposed. Ti e late
Goncral Hayne, then a distinguished atom'
ber of tiiis body, took very active part a.
gainst it; and I well remember after la pa.
ssag*>, that he contolod himself with the be. lief
that, though oppressive, it would be the
last. His expectation proved as vain as
mine ii '16. Before two years had passed, *
we were again besieged with the cry of the
inadequacy of the protection ; and, io the
summer of 1827, u large convention of
manufacturers from all parts was held at
Harrisburg, in Pennsylvania, to device a
new and moro ample scheme of protection
to be laid before Congress at the next session.
That movement ended in the ad op.
tioQ of the tariff of 1628, whi -b in order to h1
make sore work, went far beyond all its 1
predecessors in tbo increase of du'y. Th- 1
duties were raised on tho leading articles of 1
consnmpiion from fgtf to fifty pe r e<>nt. a- 1
bove former duties, as hiuh us tjbey were. 1
I speak conjeemrally, without any c? rtain 1
data. In less than three years, even this 1
enormous rise proved to be insufficient, ns f 1

State I represent, arrested its fur b r progress?no,
thai is not strough enough?
brought the system to tho ground, against
the resistance of the Administration and '
Opposition?never, I trust, to rise again.
The fact disclosed by this brief historical
sketch is, that there is a constant tendency
to increase in the protective system ; and
that every increase of doty, however high,
. requires periodically, after a short interval,
en additional iacrease. This, as I have
stated, is notaccideatal, but is tho result of
causes inherent in the system itself, in the
present condition of our country. It originates
in the fact that every increase
of protection is necessarily followed
by an expansion of tiie currency, which
expansion must continue to rniarg*
till the increased prico of production
in consequence shall become equal to the
increased duty, and when the importation
> of the articles prohibited may again take
place with profit. That is the principle ;
and as it is essentia) to the peace and pros.

iy understood, I intend to establish its truth
beyond doubt or cavil; and for that purpose,
j shall begin with the tariff of 28, the last and
by far the boldest of the series, - wirh the
view of illustrating, in its case, the operation
of the principle. I entreat the Senate to
give roe its fixed attention. The principle,
well understood, will shed a flood of light
on the past and present difficulties of the
country, and guide us in safety in our future
course.
To give a clear conception of the operation
of the tariff of 1828, it will be necessary
to premise that it comprehended all th*
leading articles of consumption that could
be manufactured in our country ; amounting
in value to not much less one-half of
lb* whole of the imports; that the duties on
tbeso articles were Increased enormously,
as,his been stated?say not less than forty
or fifty per cent ; that the average domesti
exports at the timeAvas not much short <
sixty millions of dollars, and the imports fc
consumption about the aunie; that the ret
jenue from the imports was about half ib?
sum ; and that of the exports, about thret
fourths consisted of the great agriculture
staples of the South. What, then, wn
these fuct*,must have been i's necessary of
! petitions on the currency of the manufacl
l uring States 1 We export to import. 1
is imfiotsible o continue to export for nn
considerable length of time, without a cor
responding return of imports. It would b
to give away our labor for nothing. Ou
exports, then, continuing at an average o
aixty millions, in what, under he operatio
of the tariff of 1828, must the correspond
ing imports to the game amount return
Not, certainly, to the same extent as befor
its passage, in thearticleson which it hads
greatly increased the duties ? Its object i
ra sing them, was to give our manufacture
the home marker, by excluding the for
eign articles of the same descrip ion. If
failed in that, it failed in accomplishing an
good whatever, and became ati unmixed ev
il, wkhout beoefr to any one. The return
then, of imports, must have been principal)
in articles on which the duties were not rai
sed, a*f?r as the consumption of the coun
try grants, and the balance, after payinj
what ires due abroad, in gold and silver

must have been to turn th? domestic exchan

States, and m favor ol the manufacturing
io u ;d*rstand this portion oflhe operation
j mustagah rep??ot that the-object of tin
tariff was to cut off the consumption of ihi
foreign nrticles, in order that they should b
supplied by our own manufactures. Th
necessary consequence of this must hav
been to diminish the demand abroad, am
to increase it in the manufacturing Stntet
end thereby to turn the influx of gold am
silver to thatpbint, in order to purchase th
supplies there, which we hive been in th
habit of obrnrning from abroad. Thrs
caus 's combined, must have the efFect o
adding greatly to the capacity of the bank
in that quarter to extend their discounts am
accommodations, and with it the cirenlatio
of iheir i.otcs. VVi;ha growing supply c

is no limit to tbe business of b inks, nor ar

Under the operation of such powerfu
causes, there coulJ not but bo a vast am
sudden expansion of the cunency when
they were in such great activity, and witl
hat expansion a corresponding increase o
prices and the cost of production. Noi
could this s:at? of things cease liti the in

to the duty imposed for protection. A

Such, under (he operation of the causes as

and certain. 1 intend to prove by incon
testable authority of documents, such was in

Th * first authority I shall adduce, is front
the report of a committee of the othei
House, rn ido in February, 1832. by Camp
b**ll P. White, the chairman, then a membej

tf for tho simple reason, that then* the paus'*
i- assigned must have been in thesta'eof th?
i- greatest activity. H'-r bank cir<*uluik>n

is still less so, and hers is but forty per cent.;
is and Pennsylvania, the least of the four, had,
?- excluding the Bunk of the U"il"d States, inr,
creased only twenty p?r cent. If the stateic
ment had extended farther South, and token
'c in the siaple Spates, I venture ihtlo in mak>1
iqg the assertion that, instead of expansion,
id their bank circulation would, f r the same
r, period, have been found in the oppositir
s ate, lorthe reverse reason. It will be seen
to ;be Bank of the United States had oxpanded
i- sixty.seven per cent. This great increase,
\
compared to the local banks of Penusylt
nia, may probably be at fibuted partly
loans negotiated farther East, and not ii
probably because Ivt accommodatic

oected with her e?florti, at the time, to obt?
a renewal of her chartfer.

4. Mammoth sulphur. .J
5..Pea nut.
The three first named varieties are from a per*. '-a
fectly healthy stock, and have beon raised in v '3
the south for several years. - The two last, in.
trodueed from the north "tt year ago, wero- oot
entirely exempt from disease last summer ; bat
&s the greatest care was taken to breed w?!y
from the best cocoons, it is believed there will
be little or no sickness amongst them in future,
from any hereditary taint. '1 he cocoons of the
pea.nut were very hoavr and firm. . Of these
two varieties however, onfy a limited number cah '
be supplied to each aplicant.

aora At their cost and lisk of carriage*t or they "
will bo deposited in Richmond (if so desired) at
Cotton and Clarke's, free of expense, within -<J|M
two or three days after the'order has been re.
ceived, andvhero they will be kept in a cool
cellar until called for. Or in ctfe the purchaser
might prefer it, they may remain in my iee&ouso
until noarly the time they aro wanted t> be
hatched?as thoro will be no danger- of thoir
hatching, even in Juno or July, in less than two weeks
after being reproved from the-ice, if kept
there in proper tnahhor, as these' eggs will be.
The eggs will, in all does be w&rrurted to bo
in the best condition ifrhen thfey ars forwarded,
(with the slight exception stated as to (be last
kinds;) hut if it shall appear that they are not,
the purchase money will be refunded.

ties, $10 per ounce, the cash always to be sent
