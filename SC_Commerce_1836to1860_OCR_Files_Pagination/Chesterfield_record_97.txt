Almost opposite to Coppct, on the other ^e
shore of the lake, Geneva, and in full view,
is the house where Lord Byron resided, and
in which he wrote the third canto ofChilde
Harold, the Manfred, and the prisoner of jj
Chillion. The scene of the last poein is laid ^
at the chateau of that name, on the shore
near the upper end of tiiis lake, and the prin- j.
cipal incidents are true. They belong to
the life, sufferings, and heroic elTorfs of y
Francis Bonnivoid, the defender of I he liber- ^
ty of Geneva, who languished six years, j
chained to a rock in the dungeons ofChillon. ^
Byron was attended during his residence
here, by the poet Shelly, and the novelist sn
Monk Lewis. I think none of the party av
produced any kind impression 0:1 the Gene. r?
vese. The house he occupied is a plain
stone edifice, on the lake shore, just above fe:
1 I nil
Coligny, and was vacant when 1 saw it I "*
had gone in'o the country for another pur- ^
pose, and finding myself at the gate, walk- "
rd in for a moment, upon the gloomy s:one co
terrace. I take Byron to have been one cu
of the most extraordinary combinations that
has had the human shape. His poeticgenius
was in modern times, altogether unparallelled.
And yet his heart was cold. st'
stern, and bitter, and his spirit caustic.and ha
capricious, to a degree that would seem
incompatible with a s'rong perception of i ?f
what is bcauuful and lovely, and inconsis-!
tent with the fervid control of the iningina- F*
tion. It proves that intense passion and sai
profound thought, have no necessary con- 'e
nection, with these qualities to which men Sc
have delighted to unite them, nay, more, in
t.iat naked and alone, they may triumph in I ni<
regions appropriated to them, only when in
guided and sustained by more refined and m<
tender impulses. po
On the same side of the river as Coppef, .
hut nearer to Geneva, is the village of Perliev,
the residence and 1 believe the domain
of Voltaire, who made the acquisition of it ?.
in 1759, and lived in the chateau, if it de- sni
serve the name, till his death in 1775. ar\1
Thevilliage is in the French territory, but
- ? ru,
being only five or six miles trom Uenevn, ?
and the road from thence delighful, it may UP
be regarded as far as travellers arc interested
in it, as an appurtenance of that city.
Voltaire once said in derision of the Gene. *c<
vesc, that if he shook his wig he could on
powder the whole republic. At pr< sent, I
believe few persons finds their way to his
mansion, except those attracted to Geneva, j ^ei
by its own objects of interest, so derided by lJtl
the literary leviathan, in the height of his a?
glory. Count Bude of a Genevese family, 5?
and a Protestant, is the owner of Forney : J
and another house still nearer to Geneva. 'e<
once occupied by Voltaire, is at present not WE
only owned and occupied by a Momier,
hut f was foIJ a part of it wasappropriatcd to :
the purposes of a magazine for Bible and ;
religious tracts. The succession .to Vol- c?
tairc seems even more extraordinary than on
that to Gibbon. ',a
matter a vcrv paltry affair. The house is
a comfortable, and rather large country
house; the grounds pretty?not more, liar- j t|K
diyso much. The boasted church which \ at
Voltaire built, and inscribed on the front? j t|K
Deo erixit Voltaire, I found full of wood and I frc

objects of interest are his private apartments, i jri
which are said to be preserved in the same ( on
s ate which he left them. These are par- (or
ticularly mean. They consist of an outer p(
hall?an interior saloon of a circular shape, arT
behind it, and a small bed room on the left Wi
ofit. Every thing here fills one surprise ^
when it is remembered that this is the most co
secrete place of a man of wealth and in.
conveivable vanity and pretensions, at the co

row together t!c following items ofi

debted to the Boston Atlas. They j
undantly prove that the pretenders at I

untenance or support for their pernicious j

"Mr. Henry Burgess, Secretary of the

"An article in the 5Gth volume of the

me Mr. McCulloch in whom the Globe
joices, states that ' Gold is rarely seen in

"The same writer says, in the same arle,
'We do not know that the circulation i

any importance. There is hardly a

"Mr. Thomas amvood, in allusion to

in conformity with the orders of flis Majesty's
Government, as well as for the
protection and kindness 1 have ever experienced
from the local authoritiej of this city,
I am bound to require ofall masters of British

and in order to deter other masters of British
vessels from a violation of the laws of the
corporation, I have taken measures for
prosecuting the master of the Lockvoods
for a breach, also, of the laws of England,
inasmuch as he has incurred the penalty oi
?100 (one hundred pounds) for not produ

We stated last week, that Gen. Jac'csor.
had come out with a letter in favor )f a
National Bank ; we did not correctly understand
our informant at the time, he did
not intend to say that the General had made
any publication, but in conversation with
his friends recently, he advocated a bank,
without suggesting any additional res:rictions
to those placed on the former bank,
except that it should not issue blls under
twenty dollars. We were further informed
that the Vice President had teen at the
Hermitage for several days, prewous to the
General's political regeneration.* We
sincerely hope that the report is true, for

AN INDEPENDENT POLITICIAN.
Mr. Talmadge, United States Senator fr?m
New York, considering his views misrepnsented
or misunderstood by the Editor of tie j
New York Evening Post/publishes a lettc,
addressed to that Editor, from which we male
the following extract:
"The editor of the Post is pleased to remark,
that my speech in the Senate of the
United States, about a year 6ince, on the dtposite
act, in which I ventured some views ii
1 - J..1 ?_1
relation to our crean system, * was uuiy copiei
into the whig papers with great applause,'
&c. Seeing those papers but seldom, 1 was
not aware how extensively it had been copiei
or applauded by them. I was, however, a;
that time in the regulat receipt of the Even,
ing Post, and I do not recollect to have seei
that speech copied into its columns, and an
not aware that its readers have ever been favored
with my views on the subject, to enabh
them to form an opinion of the correctness o'
the animadversions of the Tost- Those viewi
I believed correct at the time, and I have seen
nothing since to change them, but every thing
to confirm them. I have no disguise about m>
opinions on this subject. I am in favour o;
a well regulated credit system, and opposed
to the chimerical scheme of an Executin
metallic currency. The following extract from
the speech which has so unceremoneously received
the censure of the Post, will show my
opinions then, as well as the opinions which I
now entertain
" ft 1:* ?... * l. ~

feature between despotism and liberty; it is
the offspring of free institutions: it is found
to exist, and its influence is felt, in proportion
to the freedom enjoyed by any people. By
freedom I do not mean unregulated, unrestrained
natural liberty, but that freedom
which founded on just and equitable laws;
where the rights of personal security, of privaie
property, ana reJigious toleration are
guaranteed to every individual; where there
is a general diffusion and knowledge, and the
existence of public and private morality.
These are the elements, and they together
form the basis of public confidence of which
the credit system rests. This is the invention
of modern times. In the old governments
of Europe, where liberty never found a resting
plice, credit was unknown. To the United
States, has been left the honor of maturing
and perfecting this system. To the United
States, also, is the honor due of having first
applied the system of steam navigation. The
effects on the internal prosperity of the nation
have been as sensibly felt in the one case
as in the other; and he who should at this
day recommend an entire abandonment of our
credit system for a sole and exclusive metalic
currency, would be deemed no less visionarv
than he who should attempt to substitute a
Pennsylvania? wagon for a locomotive or. anal
packet, or should endeavor to stem the repistless
current of the Mississippi in a flat
boat, instead of those splendid palaces which
now move mojestically on its waters. Shall
we then, Mr. President, check its time of prosperity,
by the introduction of new and untired
schemes ? Shall we not be content with the
necessaries, the comforts, the conveniences,
and the luxuries of life, which aro so widely
diffused throughout this whole country 1 Shall
we attempt to overthrow, subvert and destroy,
a system which has produced all these blessings
? which has brought happiness and plenty
to the door of every man ? and that, too, for
the purpose of adopting some of the exploded
doctrines of the political economists of Europe?
Sir, you might as well attempt to apply
the common law of England, which was
born and nurtured on the Thames, to the father
of waters of this western world, and to
our mighty inland seas, compared with which,
the boasted streams and lakes of Europe dwindle
into rills and ponds beside them. Yes,
these vast inland seas, into which, in the language
of a distinguished Senator of my own
State, you might cast the whole land of the
common law, without producing a rimple.
Sir, I believe I speak the almost unanimous
sentiment of mv political friends in this Senate,
when I say they intend no such thing. I
believe I speak the sentiment of the democratic
party throughout the Union, when I
say, I believe they neither expect nor desire
any such thing. What, then, do they expect
and desire1 I answer no more, nor no less,
than every real friend to his country is willing
to adopt, namely, a preservation, and at
the same time a regulation, of the credit system.
In all such measures of reform, I will
go as far as he who goes farthest. Preserve
and regulate, but not destroy, is my motto.
Enlarge your specie basis; introduce, as far
as practicable, a gold currency by the prohibition
of small notes ; provide means for coining
at the mint; take all proper measures to
ptevent excessive issues of bank paper, and
the unnecessary increase of bank incorpora

permit the free employment and investment
of foreign capital. Whatever danger there
may be, is to be found in the abuse of the system,
and not in its existence. Guard against
these abuses, and correct them when discovered.
An entire abandonment of the credit
system, and a return to a sole and exclusive
metalic currency, if it were practicable, would
produce dessolation and destruction from one
extremity of the Union to the other. Such
notions ought not, cannot, must not prevail."
The difficulties under which the country
now labors, have been increased by the efforts
which have been made, by visionary theorists,
to impair confidence in our credit system, and
to introduce in its stead an exclusive metaiic
currency. Such being my convictions, then
and now, they cannot be changed by chargI
ing them to improper motives, and I am yet
j to learn that the democracy of the State of
j New York entertain different views from
j these. At all events as long as I am called upi
?? *~ in ro(rar<t trt

! matters in which the great and vital interests
I of the country are so deeply involved, I will
j discharge that duty conscientiously and feari
lessly, without reference to denunciations from
i such a quarter. I have been too long intimately
associated with the democracy of the
State, to doubt that the correctness of
my motives will be duly appreciated by them;
and if there be a difference of opinion between
any portion of my fellow citizens and
myself, I trust 1 shall be able to do you the
j justice, whatever they may do to me, to asj
cribe it to the honest and patriotic, rather
than to sinister and interested motives."
Great disaster at Baltimore.?Thro'
- ?* < .
I a pan or mis cny, inert; run's <i mruum, uantu
Jones' Falls, which occasionally overflows its
banks, and sometimes does great damage.
It did so on the night of the 14th instant, and
destroyed much property, as well as many
i lives. We extract the following from the acJ
counts of the disaster by the Baltimore pai
pers :?
Such was the darkness of the night, the
lateness of the hour, and so little was a calamity
so dreadful aroamoj oC, a?<J oudden
the mnundation, that few were afforded time
for escape, and the consequence was the sacrifice
of many lives?a complete list of which
i may never be obtained. At this moment we
are not enabled to go into a full detail of .the
dreadful consequences of this innundation;
and, for a full account, must wait for further
developments.
The more we wander around the scene of
desolation, the more fully is the ruin developed.
The heart sickens at the contemplation
of a scene so dreadful. We cannot go into
all the particulars before the departure of the
mail. An intelligent gentleman, an old resident
of this city, who would not be likely to
exagerate, informs us that the loss cannot
be less than two millions of dollars. We
should think that pstimafp is rathnr larrrp.
Independently of the loss to the city by the
damages to the public bridges, the destruction
of the centre Fountain and the injury to the
Centre Murket House,1 the streets, pavements,
&c. cannot be repaired except by a
very heavy expenditure.
But the most distressed part of the naralive
yet remains to be told. Not less than fourteen
persons certainly, and, it is feared, many
more, were suddenly and most awfully hurried
into eternity by the sudden " rising in the waters."
So sudden and overwhelming was the
rush of the innundation, that these unfortunate
persons had not time to escape from their
dwellings, and were found dead either in their
beds, or evidently in the act of a vain endea[
vor to eseapc.
We have heard of some narrow escapes,
two of the most extraordinary of which are
the following : One of the German residents
was startled from his slumbers by the alarm;
and, on descending to the first floor, found
himself up to his waiste in water. He immediately
returned to the sleeping apartments,
and, having taken his sister, succeeded in
j forcing his way out and along the streets to
j one of the bridges, with the view of crossing
) to Old Town. The Bridge gavp way, and
1 earned both the individuals along with it.
They floated down the stream for some distance,
and finally succeeded in getting hold of
a fence, and extricating themselves from the
water. But the stream continued to rise rapidly,
and the German was compelled to hold
his sister obove water, by holding her up by
her hair. They then contrived to cling on to
the branches of a tree, and there remained till
morning.
A boy of twelve or fourteen had fallen from
the drift which clogged Baltimore street bridge
. into the swollen and whirling current of the
river ; and, being unable ro swim, was passing
rapidly and helplessly down the stream, only
the top of his head above water, and had
once entirely disappeared, when two young
men bravely dashed into the stream, and. just
as the drowning youth was about to be drawn
under the drift of lumber, &c., which clogged
in like manner the bridge below, on Prat st.
he was snatched, exhausted and almost lifeless,
from, death, and restored to his family.
Numerous instances occurred of hair-breadth
escape and perilous incidents. The family of
a gentleman residing near Ilillen street, in
Holliday, were aroused by the alarm from the
bells, and getting up found the second story
of the house covered with water, and a poor
horse, attracted by the lightin the room, struggling
at uie window to gain admittance. The
members of a family residing near the corner
of Holliday and Bank streets were found in
the morning safely lodged in a poplar tree near
the house, and can hardly tell how they got
1 there. The wife of Mr. Silver, in Gay street,
near the bridge, had sought shelter for herself
i and childrcu in the upper story of the house; ic
but the water having risen above the floor, it
escape, in the darkness of the night and atnid w
the fury of the storm, secmcu impossible, si
With the elements all raging around her, p
and whilst the rain still fell in torrents, she it
extended a plank, not more than eight inches a;
wide, from her "window to the balcony in the q
rear of the building occupied by Mr. Leypold, b
and conveyed her four children over, where p
they were in a place of safety. p
The heart sickens at the detail of the suf- tl
ferings, in mind and body, of the human beings
who were within the scope of the flood's fury, a
11 had been so long since any disaster has oc- w
curred from the swelling of the Falls, that tl
those who used to be always on the alert at tl
every copious fall of rain, were thrown off n
their guard; and though every effort was v
made by the watchmen and others to rouse n
the citizens, by the ringing of the bell and a
cry of alarm, they were in a great measure t<
unsuccessful. The dead hour of the nigfit tl
when the water began to swell the stream, c
found those who were in the most danger e
wrapped in sleep; and the fearful conflict of e
the elements without, deterred many from es- i
caping from their homes till escape was impossible.
Some of those whom a sense of
superior duty had called from their homes to

The packet ship, President, Captain 111
Chadwick, arrived on Sunday, and we re- w
ceived by her London papers of the evening S(
of the 9th ultimo, being one day later than K
those from Jwhich we published extracts ;on ..
Saturday. We give below all the intelligence ^
they contain of interest here. It cannot be h
doubted that the intervention of the Bank of n
England has stopped the return of an im- n
mense amount of Bills drawn in this country,
and thereby prevented an augmentation of
the general distress prevailing here; at the ?
same time we cannot but look at the conse- .
quences of the continued disappointments
which the American Houses in London are R
doomed to experience, with apprehension, ai
above all do we regret to perceive that the
Foreign Exchanges on London are turning
against England. Should this continue, there b
j will be necessarily an end to all further assis- a]
tance from the Bank.
The ship Georgia, Capt. Talbot, also arrived
yesterday from Havre, having sailed on
! the 4th of last month, but unfortunately did 0
not bring a single paper. The captain says,
however, he didB not hear that any material
change had taken place in the Havre market, d<
and that there was no other news than that r(
Louis PhiUippe had granted a general amnesty ,
to all persons confined for political offences
on the occasion of the marriage of his son,
the Duke of Orleans. pi
We had on Monday again two late arrivals d<
from England. Tne snip b'hakspeare, Capt, a]
Collins, from Liverpool, which arrived in the is
morning and sailed on the 16th ultimo. The
ship Orpheus, Capt. Bursley, which arriv- p<
ed a few hours afterwards, also from Liverpool, pi
having sailed on the 18th. We have receiv- ol
ed by these vessels and have to thank their
commanders, for London and Liverpool papers, b;
the latest of the former to the 17th and of e;
the latter to the 18th ult. w
We connot perceive, from their contents, tl
that much alteration has taken place in me g
6tate of the English Money Market, or commerce.
The continued depression, in the value tl
of all merchandize, must, we fear, be attended e:
with still further disastrous consequences; st
and on the whole, there is, as far as we can ta
discover, slight grounds, if any, to expect a e<
speedy melioration in the present disor- al
ganized state of the commercial world. The ei
packets from the country had made very short c;
voyages out; the Orpheus having brought tc
back answers to letters of the 1st May, tl
which were forwarded by the ship North hi
America . p<
Great exultation is evinced by the Conser- ri
vative party in England, at the success of
Sir Francis Burdett, who has again been re- w
turned a member of Parliament for West- o;
minster. It will be recollected that some of
the constituents of Sir Francis, thinking his w
support of the present Ministers not suffieient- a
ly decided, called upon him to resign, which S
he did, and took the chance of another elect- o
ion, in which he has been successful. 'I
The general amnesty for political offences e
granted by Louis Phillippe seems to have tl
' hushed frr a time the clamours of the or>pr?i- ' f
>n press and the attention of the Parisians
s besides, chiefly directed to the approaching*
uptials of the Duke of Orleans. The un?asonable
and inclement weather which
revailed throughout France, is the subject of
luch remark and it was apprehended that
griculture had already sustained, in conscue:
ce, serious injury. M. Arrago, the celcrated
astronomer, it is added, foretold that no
ermanent change for the better would take
lace before the 26th of May, and the result
ius far appears to verify his prediction.
The contemplated advance of the Spanish
nd Anglo-Spanish troops from St. Sebastians,
ras hourly expected to take place. The force
hat will be employed, is composed of no less
ban 30,000 men, the whole under the command
of the Spanish General, Espartero,
,-ith General Evans as his second in comland.
The object is said to be, to take up
station on the French frontiers, and thus inercept
the supplies which the Carlists receive
iirough France. On the whole this attempt
annot fail in its results to have an important
fleet on the contest, which has so long dividd
that uufortunate country.?N. Y. Cour.

New York, June 13.
Wo have a cessation of foreign arrivals,
he wind having changed, and ships taking
heir exit out of port in consequence, instearl
f making their entrance info cur harbour,
rhe packet ships for Europe sailed yesterday,
nd, as near as I can learn, from inquiry, they
ook with thorn from ?800,000 to ?1,000,000
follars in specie. There is, as yon may suppose
from recent occurrences, a determination
imongour importers to meet all their foreign
lebts, even though they are compelled to do
o by the payment of specie at a premium of
i, 8, and 10 per cent. The prospect, thereore,
of a speedy adjustment of our debt with
Jreat Britain is very eood. Cotton is croinjr
ut in great quantities, and cotton-growers
.[ d shippeis prefer to have it exported and
old in the cotton markets of Europe at lower
trices, to its retention at. home. The exporationof
specie, and the largo exportation of
otton and other American productions, will,
herefore, it is hoped, soon square our accounts
?ith John Bull, and preserve the credit and
he country. Anon, when our debt with
ireat Britain is paid off, gold and silver will
eturn to us, and hasten the day (if the Goernment
will only lend a helping hand) of ,
he resumption of specie payments by all the
he solvent Banks in the country. The reent
news from Europe, upon the whole, has
ad a good effect upon th.'S citv. The ability
f the American houses in England, to susain
themselves as well as they have done,
as been one cause of this. They had, up
o the latest dates, met their drafts promptly,
nd we do not anticipate the reception of
forse news than we have received. From
11 accounts, foreign as well as domestic, I
ee, or think 1 see, an end of the calamity.
"he pressure will teach all of us some pracical
lessons of wisdom, and happy is the man
rho is willing to learn wisdom from expelence.
It is to ne hoped that the Governicnt
will be as willing to learn wisdom from
xperience and experiments, as are its citiens.

The Governor of N. Carolina having con?ned
the Council of State to decide upon
ic expediency of an extra session of the
encral Assembly, we learn from the Fayettelle
Journal that they decided against such
measure.
A Philadelphin paper announces that Henr
D. Gilpin of thaCcity, has been appointed

The whole amount of duty bonds retaining
unpaid in New Orleans, sjpee 1804,
ill not exceed 812,000 at the end of the pre
?nt year. So says the'Collector, in a statelent
published in lhe New Orleans papers,
[e also states that since he came into office,
e has not had occasion to pnt a single bond

A Washington correspondent of the Auusta
Chronicle and Sentinel, gives a rumor
lat the Cabinet is about to be changed. Mr:
lives, it is said, is to be Secretary of S'ate;
nd Mr. Silas Wright, of New York, to have
n appointment. Messrs. Forsyth and Wood,
ury are to be promoted, and Mr. Dickerson
[lowed to resign.
General Hamilton, President of the Bank
f Charleston has published in the Charleston
[ercury a letter addressed to Mr. Biddle of
FT S. Bank, on the subject of the present
erangement of the money market, and the
jsumption of specie payments. We extract
le following paragraphs:?
I shall therefore now proceed with the
reatest possible brevity, but with the utmost
jferrnrp. to suggest what coca* to mc'tv be
jpropriate remedies to meet the present crislst.
I shall speak of those which are of a
?rmanent character, which I think will ap oximate
to a gradual, though effectual cure
: our currency.
2d. Those of a temporary 'character, but
r which however, the Banks might at an
irly day resume specie payments, and from
hich immediate relief might be afforded, and
le present embarrassments essentially initiated,
or entirely removed.
1st. No permanent cure can be applied to
le existing distemperature of our currency,
tcept through a fixed provission of the Conitution
and Laws by which the Bank Capid
of :he United States shall not bo increas1
hereafter; but on the contrary, be gradu
ly dinnnisnea ov weiamng in or uie L/narcs

tat shall be deemed safe and proper. Peraps
a ratio that shall be compounded of
apulation and exports, would be the safest
lie of porportion.
For this and the following purposes, it
ouldbe necesrary to obtain an amendment
f the Constitution of the United States.
1st. This amendment ought to contain like'ise
the explicit grant to Congress of the
uthoj-ity to incorporate a Bank of the United
tates, with such limitations against the abuse
f power as experience may have suggested,
'his provision ought to prohibit the Govrnnient
