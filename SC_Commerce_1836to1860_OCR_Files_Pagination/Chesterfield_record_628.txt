is very high. The farmers in the vicinity |
of Boston depend upon the city stables
for a large portion of what they use. The
price in Boston varies from three to four
dollars a cord. I have known a market
fanner to purchase one thousand dollars*
worth in a year. Since the value of !i.
quid manure is established, and its, intrin- ;
sic efficiency is so much superior to the i
solid parts of manure, it is st.ange that no
prevision is made hv the farmers for sav.

in a civilized community, the public have

careful management of them in some suittable

might be abated.
1 atn aware upon what a homely subject
I have fallen; but I know how essentially
it concerns the farmer's interest and
the public health. ? Evil be to him who

expressed his willingness to purchase all
the manure from the cow.stable in Lowell i
at five dollars per cord, though he must j
than cart it Tour or five miles in order to j
reach his farm. These prices are enor. 1
mous, and the more surprising, since a!- !
most every fanner in Middlesex has at |
hand the means of preparing a compost. :
dressing for his land of equal value, at not ;
half the cost.
Upon the farms in the vicinity very j
great quantities are carried from the livery !
stables in the citv. The long establish- !
ment at West Cambridge supplies a large |
amount of manure to the farm *rs in its
neighborhood. I do not refer in this 1
case exclusively to the excremcntitious :
matter of the swine, but also to the refuse :
garbage from the stables, of which I have
spoken. This is spread upon their grass ;
lauds, or ploughed in on their cultivated '
grounds, or spread round their apple trees; i
^ and in every case with great advantage, j
If not used immediately, it is placed in a
compost heap, and covered with mould, j
to be used when needed. It has been i
found particularly useful when applied to |
fruit-trees at the roots. It is of course
full of animal matter, and must furnish '
in abundance the principles of vegetable i
life. The intelligent farmer who gives j
me this account speaks of the effect* of j
this manure a* immediate and powerful. '
To night-soil he objects that its influence ;
is tiansient. He gives the preference
over all other* instable arnf horse manure.
He raises largely of early vegetables and
small fruits for the market. The stable
manure is more convenient for his forcing i
beds in the spring, an 1 after it has per- ]
formed its part there, is easily applied to
other crops.
Large amounts of night-soil are obtain- |
rd in Boston and ('hirlrstown, and applied
by the market-gardener*. It is brought
out in a crude state in covered and tight
wagons, and too often, without regard either
to decency or comfort, is carelessly
deposited by the road-side near the dwelling-house
in a kind of basin, where a
quantity of mould is at hand to mix with
it, to absorb the liquid parts, and to put
the whole into a condition to apply to the
soil. The slovenliness with which these
matters are sometimes managed deserves
no light censure. I knew a case in
which, in the opinion of hi* physicians,
the life of a respectable individual was a
sacrifice to one of these negligently inan
lege, he would think that he owed it to
himself to determine on the propriety of
such advice, by first reading with increas.
ed attention what the chnpter contained.
Every advance in cleanliness is nn advance
in civilization, a contribution to
health and an equal help to good morals.
The unfortunate beings who live in cities
are doomed to inhale and exhale the inumetafile
odors, which are theie comtningled
from cellars occasionally filled with
hilgewater, muddocks, which the receding
ride has left bare, common sewers,
and broken gas-pipes. In the country
th?*re is no apology for allowing any thing
offensive on the premises. The farmers
who obtain the night-soil from cities,
would find an advantage in digging a long
and deep vault, at least four feet in depth,
walled up with stone and plastered and
floored.so as to be made thoroughly tight,
and having a close and moveable cover
ing. Into this the contents of the carts
should he carefu'lv turned, with such a
constant supply of soil or muck or ashes
or effete lime or gypsum as would completely
absorb the liquid parts, and might
be so intimately incorporated with the
solid parts as to bring all into a feasible
state of application to the land. This
vault or stercorary should likewise serve
as a place of deposite for nil dead animals
in the place, and all other offensive matters,
wnieh might he converted into manure.
The contents of the family vault,
being freely mixed with mould or spent
tan, should likewise be conveyed there at
least once a week. This would i>e a
great gain to comfort and health, i saw
such an arrangement on one farm, and
iis advantages were most obvious. It
formed an excellent hank of general depositc.
whose discounts in the spring were
always most liberal and useful.
The preparation of night-soil for easy
use ami transportation, has bee i the subject
of various chemical experiments.
The prepared article goes under the name
of poudrettc; and though there have been
occasional disappointments, I have seen
it used with <;rcat success. The admix
ture of effete or slacked lime with it has
the same effect as any other absorbent;
but the application of quick lime, whiie
it destroys Us offensive oders, expels its
ammonia and proportionately reduces its
value. Liebig recommends its mixture
with gypsum or chloride of caSciuru, or
some mineral acid. I have not known
this tried. Tais would fix the ammonia
and give it out to the plants as the vital
process is prepared to take it up. The
mode of preparing it in Paris, is by drying
it in largo vats in the sun until it can be
reduced to a tine powder and loses all
smell. Its best properties are then goneFine

are substances which may b,5 mixed
with it to great advantage. It is bayond
all question one of the most powerful ol
manures, bateau only be applied advaniMtreoiislv
in a nrenared state. An es
""S I I
tuiilishiucrit for this purpose is about being
made in the county which may prove
eminently beneficial.
Bone manure has been tried to some
extent; in some cases within my knowledge,
with great and decided success; in
others, without pcrceptibie benefit. These
diverse results convince us of our ignor.
ance, and show how much we have to
hope from the investigations of chemistry
and philosophical experiments in relation
both to manures and soils, and the hitherto
scarcely approached mysteries of vegetable
life. Much of the bone manure
which has been used has been from bones
which have passed first through the hands
of the soap-boiler, and after all the gelat.
inous parts have been extracted. Aeonsiderublo
portion of their fertilizing prop
; erlies has thus been taken away. The
most successful application of bone manure
which I have known was where they
were mixed at the rate of abort one part
; to eight with leached ashes or mould, and
! a fermentation brought on before they
i were applied. They were then spread
lightly in the furrow, where carrots were
isown. The ede'cU were most favorable,
and surpassed a free dressing of barn ma
r . " m
! nure in the neighboring part of the field
: to the same kind of crop. 1 have known
! this manure applied likewise with great
| advantage to corn in the hill, a small b
mount in each hill without other manure,
j and to turnips in the drill, l'eat mud is
j used with much success by many persons.
Its application, when spread directly from
j ihe hog upon the soil, has not been ap.
proved; hut when it has been thoroughly
; decomposed and reduced by a mixture
! with stable manure, with ashes, or with
! quick lime, it has furnished a valuable
; manure for spreading upon grass ground
.or putting in the hill with corn.
Various oihtM manures have been used
! witu great success. Ashes aie every
| when; commended as excellent fir corn
; a : I wheat, and likewi-e for gras?. A ."he*
being tiie direct result of vegetub o com.
bustion, contain of course that wfiicli \?
essential to vegetable growth and life, and
being constantly carried from the earth
i by the removal of its vegetable products,
I must in some form be returned to it.
i In some cases the waste from the cot.
' ton mills has been used with much ad
| vantage; This consists of that which ij
thrown out when the cotton parses
through the picker, and is mads up noi
only of tlie wool itself but a considerable
amount of the seeds, which arc known tc
abound in oil, and at the south s:o much
| valued as ?manure. This manure w
sometimes spread thinly on grass land,
and at oiher times put into the compost
heap. It has been too little employed for
us to determine the best modes of its application.
The waste from the woollen
mills has likewise been used as a topdressing
for grass both in Tewksbury in
this county, and at Northampton in
Hampshire. I have seen its effects in
these places and in some other part9 of the
country. They have been most remarkable,
and surpassed by no manure which
J I have ever seen applied. This refuse

neighborhood of the woollen factories at
Lowell; and being surcharged with oil
used in cleansing it, there was great risk
, at rays of spontaneous combustion.
When thrown into the river it was complained
of as interfering with the shad
fishery. The amount of wool used at
the Middlesex miles in Lowell is more
than GOO 000 lbs. per year. Being full
of animal matter it is a most excellent
manure. Its value has long been appreciated
in England, but we seem to have
come late to the knowledge of it. I have
seen it spread directly upon grass land,
both in mowing and pasture grounds,
with surprising effect. It is much to be
desired that the water in which their
wools are washed, full as it is of animal
oils and alkalies, could likewise he saved
and applied to the land. It would prove
beyond doubt a most valuable manure either
applied on the grass lands or mixed
in the compost heap. In the economy of
nature nothing is without its use; and the
first duty of the farmer is to remember
that nothing should he lost. .
A very exact and intelligent farmer in
Uroton made some comparative experiments
with different manures on pieces
of land contiguous to each other, of which
he has favored me with an account. The
land to which these different substances
were applied was What is there termed
reclaimed meadow, and rich in vegetable
mould.
One bushel of ashes applied to three
square rods of land at the rate of 53 bushels
per acre; this produced a heavy burthen
of grass, and was considered the best
of the several manures applied.
Salt, applied at the rate of one peck to
three rods, or fourteen bushels per acre,
produced a fair crop, and was considered
the next host to the ashes.
Gypsum, sown at the rate of three
bushels to the acre, manifestly much improved
the crop, and was much the least
expensive application. Lime was dry
slacked and applied at the rate of one
bushel to six rods, or 26 bushels per acre,
without any perceivable effect.
1 do not present these examples as furnishing
any decisive results, but rather
with the hope of inducing farmers to make
and record exact experiments, though on
a very limited scale, that by the acciiinululion
of such facts we may arrive at
something more definite. Little can be
deduced from the above experiments, unless
equal quantities of each kind of manure
had been used; and then we want
likewise to understand the nature of the
soil, as in respect to some soils it is obvious
certain kinds of manure are much
more suitable than others.
LETTER FUOX AX AMERICAN IN ENGLAND.
By the Britannia steamer, which arrived
at Boston on the 23d ult., we received
the following letter from our friend, T. C.
Peters, Esq., president of the Gennesec
County Agricultural Society in this State,
who is now on a visit to Great Britain:?
Messrs. Gaylordand Tucker.?I have
been so entirely busy since iny arrival in
this country, that I have not had time to

In many things connected with agriculture,
they are decidedly superior to us;
and in no one thing more than in the
great attention and care they bestow
1 upon their land. No man can farm successfully
here without considerable capital
over and above his farm stock. Without
that the farmer could do but little towards
manuring, which is a great expense.
i have been shown farms where
, the outlay for manure alone was equal to
?39 per acre the first year.
As an agricultural people, we are not
[ thirty years behind the people here, and
should [ live to the common age of man,

? any thing in Europe for the perfection of
its agriculture. We have but to will and

ain in fuvor of our fences, as compared (
to the hedges and ditches, which are used ,
everywhere here. I think a good rail j
fence is fur more sightly than a great ]

At some time, I make no douht, hedges
will become necessary with us and perhaps
it is worthy of the attention of agricultural
societies to endeavor to ascertain
the best tree or shrub for quick fences.
But when other materials are reasonably
cheap, 1 would never trouble with a
hedge.
In making butter andchee.se, and pre.
serving them in good condition for market,
we are immeasurably behind the English,
Dutch, and indeed all the better
parts of agricultural Europe. I have devoted
a good deal of time and attention
to their butter and cheese here, having j

I ain satisfied there is no good reason why !
we should not inake as goad as their best. J ?
I have examined the cheese which has (

died; and that done, we might send a
large quantity into this market at a fair
profit. At present, it is no use to ship
cheese, because it cannot lie sold at a remunerating
price. Oac objection to our
cheese is, that it is too thin and fiat.
Tiiey should he made i 4 deeper hoops.
A cheese weighing from twenty-five to
thirty pounds, ought not to exceed tliir- j
teen inches in diamenter,and should I* ;
from five to seven or eight inches thick.
'It is an object with tie people here to
get as much as they can in as small a surface
as possible. Our flat cheeses present
quite too much outside for the weight.
Cheese weighing about forty pounds,
when well cured, is the best size, and
most preferred, and it should not be less
than six inches thick. Another detect is
in the making and coring. They prefer
a rich mild flavored cheese, that will not
crumble in cutting : ours is too strong of
the rennet, and not as rich as it would
he, if the farmer sold less butter. The
whey should ail he pressed out, and the
cheese well cured, so that it would keep
its shape any length of time. Great care
should he taken to make all of the same
dairy, as uniform in ta?te and appearance
as possible. In fine, if the farmer wishes
to have a ready market at homo, he
must make his cheese deeper and narrow,
er, and mild flavored, and it must he rich
and well cured, and keep its shape. My
own impression, is that none but the best
Liverpool salt should he used.
I find I have no room lelt for remarks
on butter, which perhaps your readers
will not regret. I did not got up here in
time to attend the Sinithfield Cattle
Show. Sincerely yours, T. C. Peters.
REPORT ON THE EXCHEQUER.
! The Select Committee, to whom was refer
red so much of the Message of the Pres J
blent as relates to the plan of f nance i
therein recommended to Congress, as at- i
so the Letter from the Secretary of the \
Treasury, accompanied by a draught of
a hill for the establishment of a Board
of Exchequer at the seat of Goccrnment
?rejjort, in part:
The Committee have bestowed, on the
subjects committed to thorn, nil the deliberate
and anxious consideration, which
the importance of those subjects demands.
It became their duty to inquire as to
the wisest and best method of keeping the
public moneys of the United States; the
material in which the name should he collected
and disbursed ; and the power and
obligations of the Federal Government
in regard to the currency and exchanges
of the U nion.
They entered upon the discharge of j
this duly at a period when, in consequence i
of the magnitude and pressure of the pub- !
lie debts nt many ui ine stales ot me
Union, the condition of llicir banking institutions,
and other causes, the currency
and exchanges ofa large part of the Uni? ;
led States were involved in calamitous
disoider ; at a period, when the pecuniaiy
disasters of tho country, the cxticme differences
so long existing among eminent
statesmen as to the nature and causes of
those disasters and the proper remedy for
them., and the uncertainty and instability j
of the financial policy of the Federal
Government, hud conspired to render a
sort of anarchy c?f opinion characteristic
of the. times.
Under these circumstances, the Corn. > r
mitteo felt themselves called on by the J t
Highest claims of patriotism and of honor,
to endeavor to look steadily and calmly ^
it the facts surrounding them; to eman- ; (
:ipnte their minds so far as possible from t
the dominion of all preconceived opinions; (
to bring to the solution of the great ques- ,
tions before them the benefit of at least ,
uncommitted judgments and unshackled (
freedom of decision ; to inquire not mere- 1 ,

yiew of each, hut also what was the best j ,
>f things now practicable; and having I
thus, without fear or favor, fully dis- 1 ,
charged their own duty to their country (
\nd themselves, to submit unhesitatingly |
the result of their deliberations to the ^
candor and wisdom of tho House.
They were the more strongly impelled ,
to the adoption of these principles of ac- (
lion, in consideration, that tire duty they ,
were to perform was one imposed on thern (
!>y the command of the House, noj (
nought nor desired by themselves; and ,
that, under subsisting political relations, (
for the success of any measure they ,
ruight propose, they must of necessity j
rely on its intrinsic propriety, and the (
impartial sense of the Legislature.
The Constitution of the United States .
v f
empowers Congress "to lay and collect <
taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, to pay
tne debts, and provide for the common (
defence and general welfare of the Uni. (
ted States," it being requisite that "ail j
such duties, imposts, and excises, shall be ,
uniform throughout the United States." (
And it recognises (he existence of "the (
Treasury of the United States." But it
does not prescribe the organization of {
that Treasury, nor set forth the mode in
which its personnel shall be constituted (
or its business transacted; otherwise than
as it provides that the I*reside'nt. with the
advice and consent of the Senate, shall
appoint the principal officers of the United
States. But the constitution further
provides that Congress shall have power "
to make all laws " necessary and proper
tor carrying into execution" all other
powers vested by it in the Federal Government.
And under these constitutional
provisions is the Treasury of the United
States to be organized by legislation,
and its concernsconducted ; the President
being empowered and enjoined " to take
carc that the laws be faithfully executed."
Besides this, Congress has power "to
regulate commerce with foreign nations
and among the several States;" power
" to coin monev. resrulate the vulue there.
^ ' O I
of, and of foreign coin, and fix (he stun-!
dard of weight* and measures and pow.
er 44 to borrow money on the cred.l of the
United States."
And, on the other hand, while confer,
ring these powers on the Federal Gov.
eminent, the States have expressly forbidden
to themselves and to each other to (
emit hills of credit, to make anything hut
gold and silver coin a tender in payment ,
of debts, or to pa.rs any law impairing the I ,
obligation of contracts. j .
By the act to establish the Treasury ,
Department, passed on the second of Sep.
temher, 1769, it was provided that it shall
he the duty of the Treasurer to receive ,
and keep the moneys of the United
States, and to disburse thj same, upon
warrants drawn by the Secretary of the
Treasury ; but the plan and mode of so
keeping the moneys of the United States (
were not specifically prescribed, unlimited (
scope of choice being left to the Treasurer
in this reject, subject always to the (
authority of the President to see to the (
due execution or the laws, and, in his i
executive capacity, to guard the interests ,
of the Government.
Under these provisions of law, the ft*,
cal operations of the Federal Government,
as now constituted, commenced,
and so proceeded, until the 25th of Feb.
ruarv. 1791. when the Bank of the Uni
j , r
ted States was incorporated for a period
of twenty years.
Prior to which, there existed in the
United States three incorporated banks, (
namely, that of North America, in Phil,
adelphia ; that of New York, in the city (
of New York; and that of Massachusetts, ,
in Boston; all of them established before (
the adoption of the Constitution. Each
of these hanks was a state corporation ;
for, though the Bank of North America
was originally established by Congress, in
17^1, yet it had since accepted and now
acted under a charter from Pennsylvania.
These banks, it waa thought, wore unfit
or incompetent to perform the fiscal
business of the Government; besides
which, they could not absorb any amount ,
of the public debt, no* be relied on for
advances of money to the United States,
The incorporation of the Binli of the
United States originated in an order ol

Treasury to prepare and repo/t a proper ,
plan for establishing the public credit. la .
obedience to which, the Secretary presented
two rejvorts; in one of them recommending
that the public debt be funded,
and additional taxes raised to pay tho in- (
terest on it; aud? in the other rccoin- (
mending the incorporation of a national
bank, as being of " primary importance
to the prosperous administration of the fi- J
nances," and *v?f the greatest utility in (
the operations connected with the sup- ,
port of ihe public credit," or, as set forth
in the preamble of the act, as tonding "to
give facility to the obtaining of loans for j
tho use of the Government; to which, in (
r.hL nreamLIe. was added tho frr'.hcr
*j; otfjg?|
eason of "advantage* to trade and indui?
ry."
This bank answered immediately thred ?

hree-fourihs was composed of- funded

he United States 5 3. Its notes became
? legalized currency, being declared re
:eivable in all [momenta at the Treasury*
And the system of the Government
was completed bv the act of the 2d of
April, 1792. establishing a mint, and reg*
ulnting the coins of the United State*
upon the basis of the dollar unit, previously
prescribed by the Continental Congress.
The incorporation of this bank was resisted,
in the outsot, on consideration* of
expediency and of constitutionality;
which considerations led to the refusal of
Congress to renew its charter. On the
expiration of its charter, it does not appenr
lo have been dcemed'necessary oi expedient
to legislate further, either as to the
means of collecting or the mode of keep
ng the public moneys; but this was left
o stand on the authority vested in the
H-ensurer, by the act of 1769. to receive
ind keep the moneys of the United
States.
Meanwhile, the number of hanks, incorporated
hy the several States, had increased.
previous to or at thai time, tonne
fiundred. and in 1812 about twenty mora
were incorporated, with an aggregate
capital, in the whole, of upwards of seventy.seven
millions of dollars; and the
business of the Treasury was conduced
in their notes, and by deposits* with
ihem. In the progress of the war wiui
Great Britain, all the State banks south
of Now England ceased to pay coin for
their bills, (in 1814,) as the United Stutee
Bank would, in all probability, have
done, if it hud continued to exist, as the
suspension was chi fly in conscqucuce of
advances made hy them to the Government:
hut, notwithstanding the mm-redoemability
of their bills, they continued, .
from the necessity of the case, to he received

Under thin condition of things, the act

might engage the confidence and accom.
module the wants of the citizens throughout
the Union," until the time when the
precious metals could again be rendered
"the general medium of exchange." Tho
same precise object was dwelt U|?on more
it length by the Secretary of the Treaau*
ury, (Mr. Dallas.)
The President, in his message, iodic*,
ted three means ( providing a "common
[paper) medium of circulation," viz: 1.
By the hills of the State banks ; 2. By a
national hunk ; and, 3. By 44lbenote?of
ihe Government."
In deciding for the second of theae
means, rather than the third, the Sccreta.
ry of the Treasury put his decision situ*
ply on the poiut, that there was no "adequate
motive," that is, no Government
exigency, to induce the use of its credit

aerting, at the same time, the power of lb#
Government ,4to supply and maintain a paper
medium of exchange." This
bank, then, like its predecessor,
furnished a paper declared by law to ha
receivable in all payments at the Treasury
; it was made the fiscal agrnt and the
depository of the Treasury; and it absorbed
in its capital's portion of the public
debt; since, of the thirty-five millions
of dollars constituting its stock, only sevens
millions were requ.rcd to' be in 8|>eeie, the
remaining twenty-one millions of private
subscription being authorized to be tvV
solved in stock, as also the seven million*
o he subscribed by the Government."
In further regulation of the currency*
at the same session of Congress, by an
act in the form of a resolution, passed on
ihe 30th of April, 1816, it was provided
that all duties, taxes, debts, or sumo of
money accruing or becoming payable to
the United States, shall be collected and
paid in nothing but the legal currency of
the United States, or Treasury notes, or
notes of the United States Bank, or the
notes of hanks payahlo and paid on do.
man Jin the legal currency of the Ignited,
States.
And by the combined action of ?'he>
Government, the United States tfank,
ind other causes, the bank currvncyool'
the country was brought back to a specif
itandard.
On the expiration of the legal terminf"
the charier of this hank in 1638, (a hill
for its rechrrer having been vetoed, by
President Jackson, and the public ^d epos.
