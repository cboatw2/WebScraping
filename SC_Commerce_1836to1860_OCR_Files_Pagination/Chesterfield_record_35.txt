L Mexico.? V letter from an officer of the '
U. S. iSchr. Grampus, at sen, dated the 11 th j
ult., published iu the Xew Orleans Cominor-;
c;al Bulletin, of the 22d ult., states that by
I "an act of the Mexican Congress, received .
f at Tampico, on the 2Stli May, it was decried j
U? that the Government would not accede to
any act or treaty made by Santa Anna du- j
Ting bis imprisonment in Texas, that every *
state in the republic should furnish forthwith '
one-fourtli hor forces, to be equipped and j
marched as soon as possible to Matamoras,J
and that all flags throughout the republic i
should be worn at half-mast, during tlic
imprisonment of the President. The same
letter further states that on the 1st June intelligence
was received that all the ports of
the republic had been closed against the sail-1
ing of all merchant vessels, and against all \
communication whatever with vessels of;
war, this last act being understood as par- |
ticularly directed against the United States. .
against which there appears to be the most I
bitter animosity. Most of the foreigners in j
Tampico are in fear for their lives, as threats (
are publicly made of butchering them and
robbing their houses, should Santa Anna j
be put to death. NMarlikc preparations were
in progress in every direction, and it was j
currently said that 17,000 men were to '
march against Texas, some of whom were,
on their march for head quarters at Mala
.1 4 Ai
moras. It is not probable tnai ui< y can
raise that number bv 1 or 5000, nor even
tha% but by moans of taking by force farm-'
ers aixJ nuilc drivers wherever they can be
found. President Corro promises to sell
the cruoi.ixcs from the churches, if necessary,
to carry on tiic war, and a desperate j (
struggle will b ; made to regain Texas.
A communication in the N. O. Bee, dated
Taninico, June 10th. states that early in the j
month of June the lT. S. vessels Jefferson. (
Grampus and Warren were refused permis
sion, by the commandant at that place to j (
communicate with the consul, and that their i
boats were interdicted from coming further j,
than the fort at the Bar, on the ground that j,
the port was closed, and that the govern-j (
meat had forbidden any communication ;.
v lih ships of war of any nation whatsoever. (

with as much despatch as practicable, until j
the whole are removed from the limits ofj

the Chattahochee onlv three miles below

to them of nearly 5,000 effective men, and j
in their very midst have these desperu

Schley, we are happy to state, that some
time since, anticipating the Indians would
escape, whenever they got hard pressed,
he took the precaution to order Gen. "W'il- '
cox, of Telfair county, to have a sullicicnt
armed force stationed in Baker county, to j
intercept tliem, and that the men who!
were thus ordered for this purpose, absolutely
refused to be commanded bv Gen.

Mr. Bicidle, the president of the United ;,

some days since; and I learn throuh ;i j ,
rhannel that can be relied on, that he has !:
tad one or more interviews with the Sec- i,
etary of the Treasury. It is understood
hat his visit to Washington is in conse- i,
juence of the law recently passed by ,
L'ongress,authorizing the treasury depart-1

uent to arrange and adjust wun nun uie
concerns of the late Tutted States Bank,

The friends of the lute, as well as ,
if the existing bank, must feel gratified at
his prompt movement to close up the
ltiuirs of the institution. The ndministralion
have no claims upon Mr. Biddlt, nor
ipon the stockholders of the bank over
ivhich he presided. Down to the latest
!iour they were pursuer] by the Executive j
ivith accumulated wrongs. But the pow-.
ir to injure has Ceased. The institution
has triumphed over all its enemies
jreatand small. The question which naturally
arises and whirh is propounded by
if cry mercantile fnan is; will the hank, so
uf as it possesses the means, retaliate. I
venture to predict, that it will not. Its pres fitybusiness
is far mora profitable than!
t was under the old charter. Its power J
s greater, while the r< strioiions on it are >
ess. Its usBtulnesss is extending through 1
he means of agerrcics, over the whole '
country, and the period is rapidly approaching,
when its most vindictive foes '
will not only regret that it was not rechar- f
tercd, but when they will be prepared to j
unite in urging Congress to renew the late i
charter or to create a new institution.?
The currency of the country, and the flue- J
tuating and variable state of the exchanges
w ill render apparent the necessity of such i
a great balance wheel where almost the '
whole circulating medium is composed of
paper, emited by nearly a thousand banks \
of every grade, and hue, and character, <
as to capital, credit and managers. 1
I have bad a full and free conversation ,
with a gentleman who I know has confer- i
red with one or more of the cabinet, on J
the subject of Mr. Biddies visit, and I I1
am warranted in saying, that his opinion j
(and I attach much weight to it) is, that j
rrenj thing, in relation to the transactions be- j
twct'n the bank and the Government as
stockholders will soon be a< ranged in a !
manner perfect/if satisfactory to all parties. :
Coining from the quarter whic h my information
does, I cannot entertain a doubt as
to its accuracy. Nor would it, in my opinion,
bo proper for mo to suppress this information.
I considered it highly interes- j
tingto the commercial community, as well
as to the stockholders. It may be made
perhaps to nid in relieveing the pets, and
relief they will require, or I am no prophet.

It is truly gratifying to the scientitic mind to (tha
c fleet, that though a Sydenham, a Cullen, and a the
Lush, arc no inoro, and their works only to be
^und in the libraries of tho curious, yet a Terry ter
Steel and a Sinclair still Iivo to instruct, edify, : the
nd enlighten this thrice fortunate age. Their *h?
ritings though tortured into the narrow limits of
n adrcrtiscmcnt, are destined to overturn tho
rroncous systems of tho uav and win goiden

pinions from mankind. What though they are j
mghed at and ridiculed! Other times will do j Tli
