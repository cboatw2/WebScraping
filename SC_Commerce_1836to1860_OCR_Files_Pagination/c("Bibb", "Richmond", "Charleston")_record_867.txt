SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN ADVOCATE.
From the Pittsburg Christian Advocate.
CURRENT HISTORY OF THE CHURCH.
In filling up this department of otir paper,
which we think may be made a highly interest
ing one, we shall glean from all the periodicals
of the church. The weeklies are a3 follows :
CHRISTIAN ADVOCATE AND JOURNAL.
1. The “ Christian Advocate and Jour
nal,at New York, edited by Dr. T. E. Bond,
and Rev. George Coles. This is the leading
official organ of our church, and is ably and
spiritedly conducted. The senior editor, Dr.
Bond, is a veteran Methodist, and a veteran con
troversialist, especially in the cause of the church.
He has done her efficient service in days past.
He troubles his opponents in controversy almost
equally by the clearness and force of his argu
ments, and the keenness of his good-humored
satire. The doctor will doubtless find ample
scope for his unrivalled powers in the position
which he occupies, for some time to come.
WESTERN CHRISTIAN ADVOCATE.
2. The “ Western Christian Advocate"
Cincinnati, Ohio. This paper is still under the
management of our old and highly valued
friend, and former preceptor, Dr. Elliot. He i
furnishes a grave, dignififetf, and well-conducted
sheet. He does not propose to enter into the
great controversy now agitating the church; but
we perceive he furnishes his readers with his
torical facts and important documents bearing on
the subject.
SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN ADVOCATE.
3. The “ Southern Christian Advocate,”
Charleston, S. C. We are not so well acquaint
ed with this paper as with some others. We
judge the editor, the Rev. W. M. Wightman, to
be an able and learned man, a good writer and a
high-toned Southerner in his feelings; and,
from what little acquaintance we formed with
him at General Conference, amiable and dig
nified in his manners. He is also supported in
his labours by a number of distinguished men,
such as Drs. Capers, Longstreet, Few and others.
To the Southern Christian Advocate, therefore,
we may look for a clear exhibition of Southern
views, and an able defence of Southern rights
and institutions.
RICHMOND CHRISTIAN ADVOCATE. j
4. The “ Richmond Christian Advocate"
edited by the Rev. L. M. Lee. We had an op
portunity of becoming slightly acquainted with i
brother Lee at New York. Indeed, having j
enjoyed the advantages of a former sharp editorial I
quarrel, we did not need the formalities of an in- i
troduction, but were the best friends imaginable !
“on sight." So also of Di. Smith. TheRich-i
roond Christian Advocate isconducted with grfcit
ability and zeal; the editor is an able writer,
and not inclined to shun controversy. He and
Dr. Bond have some close thrusts. By the way,
we must do brother Lee the justice to say, for the
information of Dr. Bond, and all concerned, that
he assured us that he possessed a great reputa
tion in his own conference for good nature.
This fact brother Lee will excuse us for making
known abroad, inasmuch as he very modestly
conceals it in his editorials. He writes sharply.
But we know that this is not always an indica
tion of bad temper. One of the best nalurcd
men we know, (in our conference,) writes sav
agely. The secret of the matter, we presume,
is, that a good natured man takes hard knocks
himself with such imperturbable composure, that
he imagines others able to benr them with like
good humor, and hence knocks away.
SOUTH WESTERN CHRISTIAN ADVOCATE.
5. The “ South Western Christian Advo
cate'' at Nashville, Tenn., edited by Rev. J. B.
McFerrin. With brother McFerrin, as an edi
tor, we have not much acquaintance, as he was j
not in the editorial corps when wc formerly oc-1
cupied the chair; but from what little we do j
know, we have formed a very favorable opinion !
of him and his paper. He has certainly been \
very successful in his labors, his paper having
greatly increased its circulation under his man
agement. Our brief acquaintance with him at
New York, gave us a high idea of his charac
'■ ter and talents. He produces an excellent sheet.
We judge him to be firmly Southern in his
views and feelings; but liberal and kind to those
who differ from him. His speeches and edito
rials have frequently a species of humorous sa
tire.
NORTHERN CHRISTIAN ADVOCATE.
,r 6. The “ Northern Christian Advocate,’ at
Auburn, N. Y. This paper was received under
the patronage of the General Conference at its
last session, and Rev. Nelson Rounds elected
editor. Brother Rounds is a new editor, but en
joys a very fair reputation as a writer. The first
article in the last Quarterly Review is from his
■ pen. The few numbers of his paper which have
^ ^come to hand give indications that it will take a
K ’ high rank among our weekly sheets. We wish
him great success. He professes himself firmly
anti-slavery; but not aboliton in his sentiments.
He does not propose to enter into the great con
troversy between North and South, and appears
pacific and liberal in his spirit and views.
These, with the addition of our own, are the
General Conference papers of our church.
Zion’s IIERALD AND WESLEYAN JOURNAL.
7. “ Zion’s Herald and Wesleyan Journal
Boston, Mass., Rev. Abel Stevens, editor. This
. ■ ■ v'. ■■■■' - ..■
* v-fV
is the organ of New England Methodism, and
the oldest Methodist paper in the country. Il
was at one time connected with the Christian
! Advocate and Journal. Brother Stevens’ abilities
and tact as an editor are unsurpassed. Zion’s
Herald is an old favorite of ours, especially since
under the management of brother Stevens, who
has battled firmly, ably, faithfully, and success
fully for Methodism and its institutions against
the “ Radico-Abolitionism” of that region. We
think his labours have produced a firmer attach
ment to the Methodist Episcopal Church, its
government and institutions, than previously ex
isted in New England. This paper, in our opin
ion, has done great good within the last few years.
It is decidedly anti-slavery in its tone, though
the editor does not take much part in tne contro
versy himself. He devotes a department of his
paper to the discussion of the subject of slavery,
which is mostly carried on by his correspondents.
He proposes, if we understand him, to devote
less attention, in future, to this and kindred sub
jects, and to leave the great controversy chiefly
J in the hands of others for a while. It might be
| well enough for New England Methodism, if
possible, to repose for a season from agitation
and heated controversy, and ever-varying novel
ties. Great zeal has she for what she conceives
to be righteousness; and herein we commend
her; but there are other graces and virtues be
sides contention for the faith and for the right,—
other virtues less showy, but none the less im
portant, which it is well not to forget in the ex
citement of this bustling age; stability, quietness,
peace, good will, and brotherly kindness, with
kindred graces. We would whisper in the ear
of brother Stevens and our New England friends
that many of our western and middle brethren
are somewhat fearful, that if we lose the balanc
ing power of the South, where, in church mat
ters at least, there is on inclination almost to an
oriental immutability, that the fertility of New
England genius, fruitful in “notions” and ex
pedients, may give us no rest either for flesh or
spirit. Now toe (i. e. the editor) hope for better
things, though we thus speak; and we want
brother Stevens and New England to furnish us
with abundance of matler-offact arguments to
quiet the apprehensions of our more fearful
friends.
CHRISTIAN REPOSITORY.
8. The <! Christian Repository,” at Phila
delphia, published by Orrin Rogers, and patron
ized, we believe, by the Philadelphia and New
Jersey Conferences, is an interesting and valua
ble little paper. But we are not well enough
acquianted with its sentiments and course to
speak very particularly concerning it. We
should judgp, however, that it sympathized some
what with the South.
These, then, are to be the principal sources of
information in filling up the department of cur
rent history. Besides these, we may gather some
items of information occasonially from the
“ Methodist Protestant,” “ Western Recorder,”
“ True Wesleyan,” and others, which, as
Charles Wesley used to say, may be regarded as
our best friends, as they tell us very plainly of
what they conceive to be our faults. Who was
it ?—some ancient prince, we believe, that em
ployed some person to perform the important
service of reminding him of his faults, by way
of balancing the flatteries which he received, and
of preventing injury from that source. Such an
important service do those best friends of ours
perform, lest as “ holy Willie” said,
-we “ owre high anil proud should turn,
’Case f we’re] sae gifted.”
A very meritorious work that, and one which
should be duly appreciated !
In undertaking a task of this kind, we trust we
are duly sensible of the difficulty of performing
it with candor and impartiality. There is dan
ger of not doing justice to the one side or the other.
We are so apt to undervalue the arguments
of our Opponents in opinion, and to misconstrue
their doings, that, when there are two or more
parties, it requires great watchfulness and care
not to misrepresent. Now, all that we can
promise touching this point, is, that we will do
our best to avoid injustice and partiality in repre
senting facts and arguments. And if, at any
time, we full into error, we will be ready to make
corrections when they are pointed out. In con
nection with this, our readers may bear in mind
that though we chronicle events transpiring both
in the North and South, we are decidedly North
er?tin our views and feelings. We voted with
the great body of the North in all important
matters pertaining to the case of Bishop Andrew,
and of F. A. Harding, and we have seen nothing
since to change our minds in the least degree on
the great questions there and then acted on.
Hence, we presume, if it was to do over again,
we should vote precisely as we did then. We
believe fully both in the lawfulnessanA expediency
of the action of the General Conference in these
cases. This, we say, can be borne in mind, and
allowance can be made for us accordingly._
METHODISM IN FRANCE.
You will, I hope, allow me to express a few
brief thoughts on the subject of our labours and
success in France. I am induced to do this from
a fear that many of our friends in England are
not well informed upon this subject. My com
munication will consist of a few simple facts.
I have reason to believe, that it was the persua
sion of Mr. Wesley, that from the islands of Jer
sey and Guernsey the good work which began
there, about seventy years ago, by the instrumen
tality of the devoted labours of R. C. Bracken
bury, Esq., and others, would proceed from
thence into France, and that it would ultimately
spread throughout the continent of Europe.
Many years ago this opionon was stated to me,
as having been expressed by Mr. Wesley, during
his visit to those islands, in the year 1786. Just
as he thought and desired, it has been done. From
those highly-favoured islands the reviving influ
ence of the gospel has been communicated to this
vast empire. A few pious and simple-hearted
followers of the Lord Jesus, members of the
Wesleyan Church in Guernsey, visited some of
the villages on the coast of Normandy, and were
madethe instruments of spiritual good to several
of the inhabitants of Courceil, Perier, Beuville,
and Cressons. No sooner was their attention
awakened to a sense of the all-importance of re
ligion, than they desired to have a faithful minis
ter stationed among then?v Mr. Win. Mahy, a
local preacher in Guernsey, was selected for the
work, aad was solemnly ordained to the office
and work of the ministy at Courceil, on the 24th
of September, 1791, by Dr. Coke. Mr. Mahy
I had a circuit of more than a hundred miles in
circumference; and, for several years, he had
' many seals to his ministry. At length, over
come by fatigue, and various mental trials, he
! was obliged to remove to Guernsey, and from
! thence to England, where he died, in the vear
11813. 3
From the time of Mr. Mahy’s removal until
the year 1814, there was no Wesleyan mission
ary in France; but as soon as peace was restored,
our infant societies were visited by the ministers
stationed in the Channel Islands; and it was de
lightful to find, that in the absence of pastoral
care, they continued to meet in class, and hold
public services in several of the villages in the
neighborhood of Caen. It was in the year 1816
that I was appointed by the conference to visit
those little churches; and I was so fully convinc
ed by what 1 saw among them, that the work of
grace was genuine, and in some cases deep, that
I could not but recommend to the conference the
appointment of a preacher to labor among them.
The alternate ministiy of Messrs. De Quettcville,
De Kerpesdron, Le Sneur, and Oilivier, was
made a great blessing to the people. Their zeal
was quickened, their love inflamed, and God was
eminently present in their assemblies. In the
year 1818 the Rev. Charles Cook, a man in every
way suited to the work, was stationed by the con
ference in Calvados, a circuit embracing the above
named villages, with many other places. Mr.
j Cook labored for some time in Normandy, with
j acceptance and success. The first district meet
I jn{I 'n u hich I presided, and the first we ever had
J in France, was held in Renville, April 20th and
21st, 1819. There were then three preachers sta
tioned in France, and the number of church
members was twenty-seven. The people were
very poor, and the whole amount of money rais- j
ed by them, for the support of the work during |
the year was ten shillings I In those early days !
of our labors, it was difficult to find places "to j
preach in, and still more efficult to persuade even |
awakened persons and converted believers to i
meet in class Many imagined that class-meet
ing was a kind of popish confession; and not a J
lew were prevented meeting with us, through the j
influence of their family connections. Hence j
the chief employment of the missionaries was to
go aoout »everywhere, preaching the Lord
I Jesus,” whenever they could obtain a hearing;]
1 and. in most places, “ the hand of the Lord was ]
with them, and a great many believed and turned
unto the Lord.” In 1820, we find four mission-1
aries stationed in France, and still but thirty
eight members in the society, the reasons alreadv
stated still operating so as to keep many sincere
persons from joining us in that excellent means
of grace, class-meeting. During the following
year many promising openings for the gospel
were presented, in the South of France, to the
Rev. C. Cook, who made an extensive tour
through that country. Mr. Cook preached some
times in Protestant Churches, sometimes in the
open air, and often in private houses. Multi
tudes attended his ministry, and many were
awakened and converted to God. At the follow
ing conference Mr. Cook was stationed in the
South, where he was received with joy and grat
itude. From this time to the year 1832, we find
the work gradually advancing, and the society
numbering one hundred and thirty-four members,
with lorty-one on trial. At the conference of
1833, the Rev. R. Newstead was appointed to la
bour in Paris, and to endeavor to establish an
English cause in that city, as well as to preside
i over and direct the affairs of the district. At this
] period there were two hundred and sixty-eight
i members in the society, and fifty-nine on trial.
The labors of Mr. Newstead were highly ac
ceptable and useful, and resulted in the formation
of 3n English congregation and society in this
gay and pleasure-taking metropolis. On the re
moval of Mr. Newstead to England, in 1837, we
find, in the district, five hundred and thirty-three
members, and forty-one on trial. I cannot allow
this opportunity to pass without expressing my !
deep conviction that an English Wesleyan cause
in ; Paris is of great importance, in its bear in tr
upon our work in general, and a great blessing to
hundreds and thousands of persons who speak !
the English language, whether from England,
Ireland, Scotland, America, or India; or, as is
often the case, from many other parts of the world.
I Such is my conviction, and 1 freely express
it. At our last district meeting, held*in Febru
ary, 1844, we found one thousand two hundred ;
and eighty-nine members in our churches, and !
one hundred an<l seventy-four candidates for
membership; clearly showing a gradual increase
from the beginning of our ministry in this
country. '
as l write lor the information of our friends,!
who are but little acquiantid with our work in |
France, I take leave to add, that we have thirty I
nine chapels, and ninety-one other preaching!
places, seven day school teachers, and one hum ]
dredand fifty Sabbath school teachers, fifty-five!
local preachers, one hundred and twenty-three \
class-leaders, and one thousand four hundred and ,
; forty-six Sabbath scholars. Let it not be sup-1
i P°sed by any of our good friends in England,
that our French members are doing very little
towards the support of the work. Our mission
ary collections alone, for the year 1843, amount
ed to about five hundred pounds, and our ticket
and class money, quarterly collections, «kc., con
siderably exceed that sum. How great the
change, even in this particular, since the time
when our subscriptions in France amounted to
ten shillings for the whole year ! It must also
be remarked, that our places of worship are au
thorized by the government, and we are known
and protected as a religious body in France.
In addition to the fruit of the Wesleyan min
istry, as it appears in the number of our mem
bers who meet regularly in class, much good, I'
am persuaded, has resulted from it in its bearing j
and influence on many Protestant churches. It
■ is a fact, which 1 mention from personal know
li dge, that a few years ago, the only public ser |
vice in many of the Protestant churches was one !
at noon on the Sabbath of about an hour long.'
Thechurch wasthenclosed for the whole week
and no other service was held till the following ;
Sabbath. The Wesleyan ministers visited many !
such places, and in those early days they often
preached in the churches; and what is the re
sult? At least two sermons are now preached
in them on the Sabbath, and frequently one in
the course of the week, and there is a degree of
vigor and activity in the congregation which
did not exist at the time to which I refer. In
some cases? as at Cherbourg and Mer, the Wes
leyan ministers have been the means, in the
hands of God, of raising up churches, and have
given them to pious Protestant pastors, who are
now preaching the gospel to many who, before I
! the arrival of these ministers, were sunk in vice,
j and fast bound by the strong chain of popish
superstition. These are facts, and they ought
to be known. We have also given to the Pro
testant Church pious ministers, converted and
raised up among us, who are now laboring zeal
ously in the same cause with us, though under
another name. Let it not then be said, the Wes
leynns are doing nothing in France, or that they
are only endeavoring to increase the number of
a sect. I conclude by adding the opinion of a
venerable and most respectable pastor, as ex
pressed to me only a few days ago. “ Your
work,” said he “ is genuine and deep.” It is
so; and every impartial judge will, without
hesitation, admit that the Wesleyan ministers
have been instrumental of much good in France.
—Rev. W. Toast.
A FEW OF THE RESULTS OF WAR. j
We give below n Table, displaying, as nearly
as can be estimated, the cost of war, and the loss I
of human life thereby entailed. If these are not
enough to harrow up the feelings of men even j
of the meanest intellect, and.to excite in every
breast hatred of that system by which this mis- j
application of the produce of industry, and this
horrible and atrocious butchery of mankind has i
been produced, then, indeed, do we relinquish all j
hope of ever improving the condition of present I
generations.

RELIGION IN CHINA.
‘ The indigenous religion of China is a sys
tem of Polytheism, which, like the theogonies of
Egypt and Greece, is nothing more than a con
geries of canorized fables. The regions of the
sky, the earth and sea, are parted into different
presidencies, under the tutelage of some particu
lar deity. The hills and the streams that fall
down their sides had each its protector, who was
worshipped when the husbandman was[anxious to
securo a supply of water for irrigating his rice
fields. The gods of the land are still the objects
of respect, and have rites paid to them at certain
limes. After the harvest is over, the farmer pre
sents certain offerings, which resemble a kind of
first truits. These deities seem not to be under
the control of any Supreme Eeing, but to be left
to do as they please in their proper sphere. It
is strange that a Chinese, who thoroughly under
stands that a kingdom or a household cannot be
kept in order unless there be one head, should
fancy that all the changes of the universe can be
kept in their order without the connecting influ
ence of a single mind.
The various deities are recognized by altars, in
a series of steps like the tower of Babel, by tem
ples, niches, and pictures. The oblations consist
of various kinds of edibles, as the object of ad
dress is presumed to be like a man, and to have
need of such things. The fumes of incense, the
effulgence of the taper, or the lighted tinsel,
and the sound of the gong, are things which
idolatry supposes will propitiate the good will of
the god or goddess, to whom they are addressed.
A large censor in the middle of the table, with
an urn on each side, is the model after which all
the altars are decorated. Various additions are
made, but the triad is seldom, if ever, forgotten.
These three vessels are generally made of pewter,
■ 'i. . '
and remind us of the ornaments gracing our
chimney-pieces. Incense sticks are stuck into
the censor, and as they waste deposit their ashes
around their base. These arejpmoothed, and left
to furnish a base for those (hat come after them.
As China has a religion which existed from
time immemoral, the Question may be asked,
where are the priests ? To this it may oe answer
ed, that every man is a priest; he can offer sac
rifices without the intervention of another. The
father of a family is, by virtue of his position, a
sort of high priest, and advances nearer to the altar
than any of the devotees. This provesthe high
antiquity of the national superstitions of China,
for amidst thedust and rubbish of error and will
worship, this great truth has been preserved, that
a man may draw near the footstool of the Deity
without the mediation or help of a fellow mortal.
The wily genius of priestcraft seems not to have
succeeded in taking the conscience of a Chinese
prisoner, so far as to make him believe that the
complacency of a god or goddess could be dealt
out to him at the pleasure of an earthly mediator;
yet 1 think there must have been a set of men,
who, by their knowledge and outward sanctity of
manners, raised thmselves in the eye of the multi
tude to a nearer friendship with the gods than the
rest of their fellows.—Such persons would be
virtually priests; their counsel would be asked
in matters of difficulty; they would be invited
to take a leading part in the conduct of sacrifices;
and in times of misfortune, they would be asked
what god or goddess it was that had taken um
brage at the conduct of the inquirer?—Lay’s
Chinese.
POWER OF PRAYER.
Prayer is a great and essential part of the means
God has ordained for the conversion of the
world. The preaching of the word, unaccom
panied by the Spirit of God, will be utterly un
productive; and the outpouring of the Spirit is
promised in answer to importunate, believing
prayer. Almost ns much good may be done in
the closet as in the pulpit, by those who will,
like Jacob, wrestle with God for his blessing.
Nay, all the mighty men of war in the church
of God, since the foundation of the world, who
have shook hell to any amount, have been men
of the closet. Moses pleaded until he had power
to turn aside heaven’s red hot thunder-bolts,
though God had said, “Let me alone, that all
my wrath may rise, the wicked to consume.11
But while Justice heard him pray in faith, He
could not seal the sinner's doom; so that after a j
mighty struggle, he obtained power with God,—
spanned his strong arms of faith round six hundred
; thousand wicked reprobates,—bound them to the
cross, and God in his mercy pardoned them, and
; promised to go with them as before. Elijah, af
' ter long and poweiful pleading, shut and opened
i heaven. We will not, however, speak of what
| prophets, apostles, and other inspired men have
j done through faith and prayer, lest Satan should
j take advantage, and say, it would be impious to
; expect the power with God that such holy men
had. Look then at a Baxter;—he stained his
j study walls with praying breath ; and, after he
j got anointed with the unction of the Holy Ghost,
j sent a river of living water over Kidderminster,
! and converted hundreds. Luther and his coadju
tors were men of such mighty pleading with God,
that they broke the spell of ages, and laid nations
j subdued at the loot of the cross. John Knox
grasped in his strong arms of faith all Scotland ;
his prayers terrified tyrants. Whitefield, after
much holy, faithful closet pleading, went to the
devil’s fair, and took more than one thousand
souls out of the paw of the lion in one day. See
a praying Wesley turn more than ten thousand
souls to the Lord.— Tract on the “Pomrofi
Prayer."
THE DAY OF REST.
Few blessings have been bestowed upon the
race of man more precious than the rest of the
Sabbath. If we but rightly value it, we never
should present our thanksgiving to God, without
praising him for the appointment of this day.
We make a sad mistake, if we judge of the val
ue of the Sabbath by the manner in which it is
regarded in our fallen world. The greater part
of mankind esteem nothing to be desirable that*
calls their attention to serious things, and especi
ally to the concerns of the soul. They would
rather pursue their giddy pleasures undisturbed,
than to turn aside from them even for a single
day to think of God, and heaven, and eternal
life. But to one whose heart is right in the
sight of God, the Sabbath is a day of inexpres
sible delight. Such a one longs to shut the
world out of his thoughts; to take the Bible,
and study it with diligence; to examine himself;
to survey the past and the future; to contemplate
the divine perfections, and to attend on the ap
propriate duties of public and private worship.
Behold the morning sun
Begins his glorious way;
His beams through all the nations run,
And life and light convey.
But where the Gospel comes,
It spreads diviner light;
It calls dead sinners from their tombs,
And gives the blind their sight.
How perfect is thy word,
And all thy judgments just;
' For ever sure thy promise, Lord,
And men securely trust.
My gracious God, how plain
Are thy directions given!
O may I never read in vain,
But find the path to heaven.
FORGIVENESS.
“ With what measure yo mete, it shall be measured to you again.”
Lile is not a fairy dream, in which all thg
fairest and most beautiful of earth’s blessings are
strewn with lavish hand to bless and soothe us
with their magic sweetness,—but a stern reality,
where we meet with frowns as well as smiles:
where clouds, and storms, and tempests, succeea
to the placid breeze and soft serenity of the blue
etherial skies. Frlfnds may meet us with a
gladsome smile, yet part with angry frowns; the
words spoken in jest and intended as but the
pleasing remark of a light, perhaps volatile
heart, may cause offence, and end in coldness and
displeasure; and thus on through life’s mazy
ways we go with nought to cheer or soothe us
but one bright thought,—that forgiveness may
follow in the pith of error,—that the kind heart
of one who was a friend will not be estranged,
because of an unintentional error, committed in a
thoughtless and unguarded moment, but, remem
bering, “ with what measure ye mete, it shall
be measured to you again,” and in that spirit,
which is a mark of true nobleness, he will extend
the proffered hand, and speak from the eyes
more effectually than words can speak, the lan
guage which his heart feels; that all is forgotten
and forgiven.
In contemplating the heavens when the great
luminary of light has hid his face beyond the
western hills, and clothed ail nature in a mantle
of darkness, one star will attract and rivet our
attention by its superior brilliancy. In casting
our eyes over a ridge of mountains, some peak,
towering its head above the rest, will call forth
the expression of more than usual admiration.
So will that person, who, to the usual accom
plishments of life, adds the rich treasure of a for
giving heart. We are all more or less prone to
commit errors here; and as life’s fleeting hours
pass by, we do many things to offend those for
whom we have the highest friendship; yet in
the cultivation of this bright quality, these offen
ces may be robbed of their bitter sting; and
around that path, which, but for this, might have
been Idled with wretchedness and affliction, may
be thrown the richest garlands of peace ana
happiness.
BEAUTY OF THE CHURCH.
What, then, is the shining of the true Church?
Does not a Church then shine, when church ser
vice is raised from a decent and primitive sim
plicity, and decorated with pompous ceremonies,
with rich furniture and gaudy vestments? Is not
the Church then beautiful? Yes, indeed; but
all the question is, whether this be the proper,
genuine beauty, or not; whether this be not
strange fire, as the fire that Aaron’s sons used,
which became vain, and was taken as strange
fire? Methinks it cannot be better decided than
to refer it to St. John in his book of the Revela
tion. We find there the description of two seve
ral woman, the one riding in state, arrayed in
purple, decked with gold and precious stones and
pearl, chap, xvii.; the other, chap, xii., in rich
attire too, but of another kind, clothed with the
sun, and a crown of twelve stars upon her head.
The other’s decoration was all earthly; this
woman's is all celestial. What need has she
to borrow light and beauty fiom precious stones,
who is clothed with the sun, and crowned with
stars? She wears no sublunary ornaments, but
which is more noble, she treads upon them; the
moon is under her feet. Now if you know, as
you do all, without doubt, which of the two is
the Spouse of Christ, you can easily resolve the
question. The truth is, those things seem to
deck rel’gion, but they undo it Observe where
they are most used, and we shall find little or no
substance of devotion under them; as we see in
the apostate Church of Rome. This painting
is dishonourable to Christ’s Spouse, and besides
spoils her natural complexion. The superstitious
use of torches and lights in the church by day is
it kind of shining, but surely not that which is
commanded here. No; it is an affront done by
both to the sun in heaven, and to the Sun of
j Righteousness in the Church.—Leighton.

THE SABRE AND THE CROSS. s.
The subjoined paragraph from a French jour,
nal, the Commerce, is still vital in some of the
English newspapers:—“Before the Minister
of War made a grant of 5000 acres of land in
Algeria, to the community of the Trappists, the
head of the order, at the Minister’s request, visi
ted the colony, and reported, that an establish--,
ment of his order there would effect much good,
by holding out an example of the ' best mode of
reclaiming the waste lands.’ General Bugeaud
is said to have embraced the plan with defight,
and to have said to the superior—1 the sabre first,
my reverend father, and then the cross.’ ” How 1
beautiful is French Christianity in regimentals 1
Bugeaud, pious Bugeaud! is worthy of still
higher promotion. We would have him gazet
ted “General of the Army of Martyrs,” even
though the said army—raised in France—should
not be more numerous than that of General Bom
bastes. The bullet first, and then the consecra
ted wafer! The burning of Arab houses—the
groans and agony of murdered men—the des
pairing screams of violated women—the wailing
and misery of orphan children, and then—yes,
and then—the lamb like priest, the healibg oil
and honey of the Church, the sanctifying cen
sers, and, most hideous mockery of all, the blas
pheming Te Deum ! The cross set up by the
French Mars in Algeria I What should we say
of the murderer and burglar who should leave a
copy of“ The Whole Duty of Man” on the
hearth-stone of his victims? But there are a set
of Christians who constantly confound the cross
with the gibbet, and deem a place of bloodshed
and rapine the spot of all others best chosen for
it There is no doubt that General Bugeaud is
of this persuasion. We can fancy him, in his
meekness, setting a morning edge to his sabre on
the cover of his Prayer Book I
CAPT. ELLIOTT’S CONVERSION.
“ A request has been handed me, (said Capt.
Elliott in an address to the Seamen’s Friend
Society,) to relate the story of my conversion.
I will do it as briefly as I may. My father’s
house was a hotel of religion, and my education
was the best that piety could have bestowed.
Early in life I went to sea, and was converted on
a voyage from Matanzas, when I was far gone
in practical infidelity and sin.’ It was on this
wise. I had a job over the bows, and being
somewhat particular about the work, I concluded
to do it myself. Thera was a high sea rolling,
but I had the jib hauled down, and over the
bows l got. There had I worked for some ten
minutes, sawing asunder two thick ropes, when
suddenly I cast my eyes upwards at the rope.
1 My God,’ I exclaimed, ‘ I have been hanging
by an old yarn that would not hold an infant’
My hair stood erect—L jumped on deck, and
laughed away the fright. I was that night out
at the first watch, and while walking the deck,
the thought flashed upon my mind, ‘If the rope
yarn had broken, where should I have been?’
and I answered aloud, ‘ In hell, to all intents and
purposes!’ I dropped instantly upon my knees,
and cried aloud for mercy. For seven days my
:ondition was truly awful. The captain thought
l was crazy. I was praying every opportunity
[ could find, but found, no rest. My old Bible,
:hat had long Iain on the bottom or my chest,
was now drawn forth and read with intense
interest. At length, one day, while laying upon
i yard-arm and thinking ray case hopeless, I
bethought me to try again. I poured out my
soul to God in the most urgent entreaties for
grace to help. 1 Help now, Lord, or I perish!’
