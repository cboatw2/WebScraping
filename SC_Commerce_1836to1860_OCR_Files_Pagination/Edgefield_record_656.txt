propriety be doubted, whether on this subjc
anything remains to my, which has not been
said.
In our duties as a Society gentlemen, we
have not been deli nent, neither have we
been far behind in advantage- resnting
from such an organisation. At our first anni
versary, we were favored with an address
which presents a beautiful and practical brief
of our interests and duties, as a class or Agri
culturists; the reports of our several commit
tees have been laid before us for our mutual
ingetion; and through the pre, we have
recomed no inconsiderable portion of that mov
ing maw of useful and experimental intelli
gence. which the active spirit of the tines has
put en circulation. Had I the pen of wisdom.
ortongue of eloquence. what more could I hope
to do, than these have done.
Nevertheless, it does not become us to be Pi.
lent; but, whether we add anything to the
stock of general information or not; to evince
g least by our interest and action, that wn pro.
perly appreciate the work in which we have
engaged ourselves toco-operate. Although as
I have before intimated, we have no lack of
practical instruction, 3 nt you will allow me to
remartentlemen, that more has been said than
doze hitherto: the resolution to nosk up the
- materials which we have collected is not yet
suficiently roused, and perhaps I could unt
rore pro*tably engage your attention at this
time, than by urging upon you a few consider
ations in favorof the excellenceof Agriculture,
and theimportance of treating it as a science.
Its antiquity and its immediate enanation
from divine well, are the first recommenda'inns
I shall notice; and these of themselves would
seem sulcient to render it worthy of our moist
ardent pursuit. If I w-re ablo, I should not
deem it essential to enter upon a learned and
abstrose disquiition to prove the antiquity of
its oregin. T Sacred writings declare to us,
all ta may be known with certainty on this
poit. vii: That man went out from the gar
dn of Eden to " till the ground," and that too
under the express commad of Heaven.
You will bear with me, while I endeavor to
trace something of its progiess through the his
tories of nations; and shew what etire this
science has upon the social relations of life:
In the second age, Husbandry. in it* simplest
form, as we may suppose. waschosen as an oc
cupation: for " the fruits of the earth" as well
as ' the frstlingsof the dock" were used as sa.
crifices of men. But soon after arose the age
ofinvention, when scorning the original procla
tnation -'the early inhabitants of the world. left
the fieks of honest labor, and learned to -dieas
and dance and troll the eye," till they and their
works were swept away in the Bood, as rebel
lions and unworthy.

the hand of God, and that it become neglected

Like the religion of Stahomet. Agriculture is
indebted in some measure to the sword for its
establishment, far the Roman armies as they
