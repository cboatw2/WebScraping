ThiSeertisry of the Treasury will lay.
before heiu additional infutation contain
ing new details o,this interesting subject.
To these I ask your early attention.* That
it should have given rise to great aiversity
ofopinion, cannot be a subject of surprise.
Afler the collection and custody of the pub.
lic moneys had bees for so many years
onected with. and made subsidiary to the
advancement of private interests, a return
to the simple and self denying ordinances
of the Constitution could not but be dill!
oult. But time and free discussion, elicit
ing the sentiments of the people, and aided
by 'that conciliarory spirit which has oever
charac' -'ed their course on great emer
gencies, w ere relied upon for a satisfactory
settlement of the question. Already has
this auticiptktion on one important point
at leasi--the impropriety of diverting
public money to private purposes-been
'fully realized. There is no reason tosup
pos' that legislation upon that branch of
the subject would now be embarrassed by
a dil'erence.of opinion, or fail to receive
the cordial support of a large majority of
our constituents. The connection which
formerly existed between the Government
and banks, wvasin reality injurious to bo:h,
as well as to the general interest or the
community at large. It aggravated the
disasters of trade and the derangements of
commercial intercourse, and acministered
new excitement and additional means to
wild and t'eckless speculations, the disap
pointmnents of which threw the country in
to convulsions of panic, and all but pro
duced violence and bloodshed. The in
prudent expansion of bank credits, which
was the natural result of the command of
the revenues of the State, furnished the
resources for unbohnded license in every
speciesof adventtre, reduced industry from
its regular and salutary occupations by the
hope of dbundance without labor, and de
ranged the social state by tempting all
trades and professions into the vortex of
speculation on remote contingencies.
The same wide-spreading influence im
peded also the resources of the Govern
Tnent. curtailed its useful operations, em
barrassed the fulfilment or its obligations.
and seriously interfrred with the execution
of the laws. Large appropriations and
oppressive taxes are the natural conse
quences of ench a connection. since 'hey
increase the profit ofAhose who are allow
ed to nse the public funds, and make it
their interest that money should Ie occu
mutated and expenditures multiplied. It
is thus that a concentrated money power
is tempted to become an active agent ini
political affairs, and all past experience
has shown,on which side that influence will
be arrayed. We deceive ourselves if we
suppose that it will ever lie found asserting
and supporting the rights of the commu
nity at large, in opposition to the claims of
the few.
In a government whose distinguishing
characteristic should be a diffision atil
equalization -f its benefits and burdeus,
the advantage of individuals will be aug
mented at tihe expense ofibe mass or the
people. Nor is it the nature of comibina
tions fori the acquisition of legislative in.
Iluence to confine their interference t6 the
frequently too strong to be resisted. The
inuence in the direcion of-public affairs,
of the community at large, is, therefore in
no slight danger of being sensibly and in
juriously affected by giving to a comipara
tively small, but very eficient class, a di.
rect and exclusive personal interest in so
important a portion of the legislation of
Congress, as that which relates to the cus
tody of the pubilic money. If laws acting
upon private interests cannot always be
avoided, they should he contined within
the narrowest limits, and left, wherever
possible, to the Legislature or the States.
S When not thus restricted, they lead to
eombinations of powerfutl associations, fos
ter an influence necessarily selfish. nand
turn the fair course of legislation to sinis
ter ends, rather than to obijects that ad
Vance public liberty, and promote the gen
eral good.
The awhole subject now rests with you.
and I cannot .mtI express a hope that some
definte measure will be adopited at the
present session.
It will not, I am sure, he dlfemed ont of
place, for tne here to remark, that the dec
I aration of my views in opposition to the
policy ofemp'oying banks as depositories
of the Government funda, cannot justly lbe
construed as indicative of hostility, official
orpersonal, to those institutions: or to re
peat, in this form, and1 in connection with
this subject. opinions which I have unina
formly entertained, and on all proper occa
sions expressed. Though always opposed
to their creation in the form of exclusive
privileges, amid as a State magistrate aimo
ang by appropriate le-gislation,to secure the
comarimuity, against the consequenices of
their occasional mismanagement, I have
yet ever wished to see theom protected in
time exercise of rights conferred by law,anmd
have never doubted their utility, wvhenj
properly mnauged, in promoting the inter
ustof trade, amnd, through that channel, the
othier interests of tihe commmunisy. To the
General Government, they present them
selves merely as State institutions, having
no necessary connectioni with its legisla
tion or isa admitnistration. Like other
State establishments, they may be used or
not,in conducting the affairs of tihe Govern.
-maent, as public policy ead 'he general in
terests of the Unioni may scem to requir'e.
The only,safe or proper principle, upo~n
which their intercourse with thme Govern
ment can be regulatcd, is that which regmi
lutes their intercourse wvith the private citi
aen-the conferring if mutual benefits.--.
Whien the Government can accomplishm a
financial operation beter~ with the aidl of
the banks than withmo-., it should lie at lib
orty to seek that aid as it would the servi
esee a private banker, or other enpilalists
or agents, giving the preference to those
who wmll serve it,on time best termos. Nor
ean there ever exists an interest in the off.
eers of the General Goverineng, as such,
inducing them to embarrass, or anmnoy the
State banks, any more than imncur the hos
sility of any other class of State intismi utions,
or of private citizens. It is not in thme na
ture of thminga that hostility to those institu-1
tions canm spring from this source, or any
oppo-ition to their course of business, ex
the objects of(their creation. and atten6pt to
asurp powers notvonferted upowoem. ot.
to subvert Vhe standard of value established
by the Constitus.i'.. While opposition to
their regular opeuttions cannotexisein this
quarter, resistance to) any attempt to make
the Government dependent upon them, for
the successful admimistration of public af
fairs, is a matter of duiy, as I trust it ever
will be of in. lination, no mefter fromst what
motive or consideration, the attempt may
originate. ,
It is no more thans just to *ay. that it the
late emergency, most of them firmly sesis
ted the strongest temptation to exteud their
paper issues, when app'arently sustained
in u suspension' of specie payments by

this honorable course, aided by t he resis

GOV, NOBLE'S INAUGURAL.
Felluto Citizens of the Senate,
and House of Representatives.
Called by yout -,frrages to occupy the
station of Chief Ma istrate of the state. I
obey the summons; and while I feel deep
ly impressed witl profound emotions of
gratitude for this distinguished mark of
yourconfidence and regard, and tender you
iy unfeigned acknowledgements for the
manifestation, I cantot at the same tine
hut approach the execution of the high
trust with an sundissembled diffidence of
tny ability to fultil your just expectations.
Rtelyiug, however, as I do. on your wonted
generoue indulgence towards your public
servants, when their acts proceed from
pure intentions and a sincere zeal in
the service of their country. it will nut, I
hope, be regarded as arrogance in me, to
say that I shall bring these qualities wi5h
nti into office.
When I take a survey of the State,and
contemplate the coincidence (if opinions
and harmony of feelings among her citi
zens on the leading political qbestions of
tho day-whcn I behold the noble attitude
of her people, dismissing from their bosoms
the bitter feuds of party strife, which at
one time distracted their counsels, and
fntgnanimously uniting in one lofly pur
pose of maintaining their political rights,
and advancing their own prosperity, I am
emboldened to anticipate the aest glori
State to the gnfederacy of Republies, of
which she is a sovereign 'member, a new
field of duty, extending beyond our terri
toral limits, opens to the viow-impor
tant interests, comprehending the welfare
of a great country, abounding in popul;t
ison, wealth, ansi enterprise, claim our se
rious attention. Nor should it he regarded
as an interference in matters not belouging
to our legitimate sphere, or an unjustifia
tle departure from the line of duty. that
the State should wvatch with a scrutiniz&ing
eye the proiceedings of the geonra gove rt
ment. The Federal Government was cr
ated .hy the States to promote their own
hsappiness and prosperity. Hence it be
cotnes the imperative duty of the States so
exercise a wholesome supervision over
their federal agents. Nothsing would be
a more certain progniostic of an approach

pirimcip)les oif the confederacy, titan the
withldrawal bsy the sovereign parties to the
compact, of all conscern in the admtinistra

the cennduct of its agents. Ans untiring"
vigilance on the part of each State, is anm
indispensabile obligation, whether we re
gard our own happiness, or te preserva
ts of the general liberty. It is itmpor
tant that the States should soexercise their
rightful powers as to set a Repulicans ex

their spirit into. and imspress their chsarac

conviction now obtains that we p *aess, in
the most eminent degree, all the einutial

The interests of commerce hav6-.been
wisuly lell, in the maini too the cke and
protection ofthe general governnect4 and
such is the commercial spirit of thei Gov
ernment and of lte people, that no neglect
of this unportant branch of industry is to
be reasonably apprehended. Neiertheless,
much remains for the State to do. The
opening of lines of intercommunication,
not only between the various sections of
the State, but between it and our sister
States, by railways, canals, and turnpike
roads, is a duty which devolves porincipally
upon the State. The varied resources and
unequalled advantages of our contry in
vite us to the work. The wants of myriads
of our hbllow -citizens demand from us the
execution of the task. The interests of
agriculture, commerce, and maunuactures,
will be inconceivably promoted by works of
internal improvement, which shall bring
into activity all our resources. The mu
tual success depends upon the prosperity
ofeachother. If our comnerce languish
es, and our manufactures are negleied, our
agriculture must suffer in the same propor
tion. The era in which we live, is distin
guished by a noble effort on the part of
the Southern States to recover their lost
portion of the direct export and iDport
trade. Sonth Carolina is among the fore
noest in this generous and laudable strug
gle-and she has indeed an abiding and
pervaiding interest in this great Measure.
By the loss of our foreign export -and im
port trade, and its concentration itk north
ern ports, every department of industry
has suffered.-None doubt our entire ca
pacity to conduct this trade upon as good
terms as our Northern hrethren.- Our
valuable staples furnish the exthantei,and
by carrying on the trade ouselves, we a

transhipment, &c. which are ,necessarily

bearing us on to fortune and success. The
tem portry panic which agitated the pub
lic mind with fearful upprehen-4ions that a
daugerous blow was ained at the credit
Mysten by the proposition to se)arate the
tnatnces of the Federal Gove-rnent from
Banks, has subsided. A calm retrospect
of the scenes and dangers thromugh which
the country has passed, has drawn the
pinhe attetntion to thte catuses of these a
larming evils. ad the remedies for their
removal. The goveranent should have
but one object in view, to oetsure the safe
ty of the revenue, to relieve the Treasury
from frequmeat embarrassments. furnish a
sound currency, and to disembarrass trade
from the blighting vicissitudes to which it
will always he liable by its connection with
the hinances of the, country. Publice opin
ion here has sancetiotned the wisdom of the
proposed separation and the recent discus
skins to which this topic thas given origin,
have shed a flood of light on the great ques
a ions itnvolved.
But there remains one agitating qtues
tion, which,, - inis direfsul conseque nces
maenaces the safety of the Union. I allude
to the abolitiont question-every day exhib
its it in a more terrilie aspect. Already
have these abolition tmisereants eneredh the
political arena, and a strong party in some
of the non-slaveholding State have sought
and obtaimed their alliatnce. The crisis
tas araivedl which admosnishes us to be
prepared for the confliet which is fast ap
proaching. Trhe slaveholding States
should look to the adoption of those tmeas
tures of precautiona &prevetntion, as well as
of defence, wijich their position demands.
A well regulated militia being essential
to our safety it becomes us to cherish and
anvagorate thts right arm of our security
andl protection, by keeping up the mnilita
ry spirit of the country, and preparing our
citizens to defend thetr firesides, and all
that is most dear to them, against the an
holy machinations of those who wotald
drench our fields ina blood, and sweep our
latnd with the bemom of destruction.
Ilamving thus,in a brief tanneor, sketched

Mr. linger submited the Ibllowing Pre
amble and Resolutions
Whereas, the Resolutions or the last
Legislature, approving tite establishaent
of an lndepenelcnt Federal Treasury, have
been represented as at variance with the
9pinions and wishes of the people of this
State:
And whereas, the-members of the pre
sent Legislatoire have beetn elected since
the adoption of the said Resolutionj, and
must he acquain:ed with the opinions and
wishes of their constituents, on the subject
to which they refer:
And whereas, it is important- that all
measures alrecting the monetary system of
the country, should be as permanent as
circumstances will permit; which cannot
be, unless the opinions and wishes of the
people he known and consulted:
Be it therefore Resolved, That this Le
gislature, also, is of opinion, that the taxes
paid by the people, for the support of the
Government, should not he deposited in
Banks, and thus confounded with funds
generally employed inironoting individ
ual interests, and private speculations; but
should be kept by respousible Treasurers,
appointed under the Laws and Coustitu
tion of the country, and used only for the
purposes to whic1t they are appropriated
by law.
Be it further Resolved, as the opinion of
this Legislature, that although a systermi of
credit is necessary to a convenient and
profitable exchange of the productions of
the country, and particularly of the star.
plus employed in foreign commerce. yet
that this system may be so far extended as
tolead to the wildest speculations, and
most ruinous consequences.
Be it further Rtsolved, That when suf
ficient credit cannot be procured to elrect
an active and profitable exchange of the
productions of tie country, (as was the
case in 1791, when the Bank capital of
the United States was no more than eight
millions, and the exports near tWenty mil
lions, and in 1816, wh#-t the Bank capital
was fifty-four millions, and the exports six
t on .1pi ons.) it,av be'Recessary and
itttt pwt-Ti
Government.
Be it Resolved, That when the system
of credlit becomes bloated, and a competi
tion arises between the leiders, not rthe bor
rowers of Maney. (,s was the case in 1836
when the capital ployed in 1anking
was two hundred aend fifty one anilholl,
and the exports but one hundred and
twets five million,) ithe facility of pro
curing credit must leadl to overirading,
anid extravagant speculations. Thus in
183G and '37, more was imported thani
could be consumned, aod Cot too. the prin
cipal export of the coutry, sold foir one
third mioude in America thau it realized in
Europe. Under such circumstances it was
neither nifeesary nor proper,int the opinion
of this Legislature, to increase the capital
employed in hanaking, or stimulate further
the caintal nlreaidy in existence.
Resol ved. further, Thim when Congress
have 'coined money. fixed the value there
of and of foreign coina, they have fual
filled their whole duty, andl exhausted thteir
constitutional power, on theo subject of ex
chtanges between the States.
.Be it furthaer Resolved, Thbat it is the o
pinion of this Legislature, that as long as
gold and silver are mite legal tentder in
every State, the curmrency of no onte cant
he seriously itmipaired.
LBe it furthe-r Resolvedl, T hat a common
metasure of value having been fixed upon
Icy C2ongrebs, the exchaage, b'etwen the
States should be left to the regumlationa of
thaose principles which govern exchanges
betwceen nationas.
Be itfurther Resolved, T hat credit, so
far as it depends uponm bao>.king capital tmay
be salely left to the regulation of' the dif
fereant States.
Ordered that thte foregoing Resolutions

who are understood to be now resident in,
and under the protection of the State o
Maine:
And whereas, the Governot of the Stato
of Georgia. has, by direction of the Legis.
lature thereof, and according to the provi
sions of the Fed.ral Coust'tution, deman.
dett of the Governor of Maine, these de
hnmquonts for trial, under the said bills of in.
dictiment;
And w hereas, the smaid Governor of the
State of Maine, instead of complying with
this demand, as under the provisions of onr
national campanct, he was in duty bound,
has refused so to dlo, stating that he must
lirnt lay the subject before the Legislature
of his State:
And whereas, from the present aspect of
he slave question, in the United States, it
mao longer becomes a slave-holding State to
withhold the decided expression of its sea
timents, on any subject involving these
momentous rights; therefore,
Reolmved. That the State of Georgia, ia
making the demand for delivery of these
lehinquenta, for trial, demanded nothing
mut what the strictest regard for justice,
>rder, respect for herself, and the most a
~red pro)visions of our national compact,
uthorined and reqtuired.
Resolved, That it is with the deepest
~oncern, we perceive one of the Chtief
blagistrastes of our confederated States, re
using promnpt icquiescence to this just and
ightful denmand.
Resolved, That a failure on the part of
he Stat.. of Maine. to fulfil her constitu
innal obligations, in this particular, will
ec a fatal blow to the security of our In
titutins, and property, and if nersisted
a, will create great atnd well founded a
arm in the slave-holding States. -.
Resoltved, T'hat the cause of Georgia, is
he cause of the whole South, and we will
nake comtmon cause with her, in all pro..
>er measures for procuring a redres, of
heme grievances, and for the manintenaneo.
f her and our comomon rights.
