fnnn of the namo of Abel Shory, a' 9killfn!
horseman of the neighborhood, was there
also; whon David (loss, jr. my cousin,
then aged about seventeen, came up from
his father's, distant about three-quarters
of a mile, with a.message to Shorey, requesting
him to go to his father's (my
. jr. . (uncle David's) and trim a horse that
uncle John Goss had just then brought i
over from Randolph, distanr forty miles. ;
1 accompanied them, and at Uncle Da-I
* YidVi we found Uncle John from Randolph, j
with a little heavy, handsome, active. !
bay horse, which he requeue! Hhc-r y to ;
trim, chiefly bv pulling out a ?i cutting ;
the hairs of his fn!, which ?;_> tea rod i;
it had been gnawed by ? a Ives. Ur de .
John said ho whh rt Ch ti !."s:> bursa that
he had got from J.s M >rgan of Randolph,
who hud i ?toiy brought him from
Montreal. I afterward* frequently heard
the manner of his purchasing the horse
related in my father's and unele David's
families, which was this: uncle John had j
lent Morgan the sum of forty dollars on
occasion of (he latter'* going a journey
to Montreal in Canada. .Morgan obtained
the horse, then four venraold, at Montreal,
and being unaMo to repay the money
on his return, disu sed of him to Uncle
John to ohv the debt. Unclo John, who ]
whs no horseman, now brought hirn to his
brother, mv uncle David, wno wns much !
of a horseman, in the hope that something i
mi^ht he m.tda by keeping him for mares. I
1 remember Sho-ey's calling hi in 4> a full I
blood French horse."
Uncle John Goss eng ged Shorev to
take the horse next dav to training at
Mnj or Butler's, and there I saw h?rn cover
four marcs. My unclo David Goss kept
the horse through the season, working
him on his farm, and outfin<? him to marcs
- r r,
when they were brought ; he also kept;
him through the next winter and the en uingspring,
when the foals were found
to be universally excellent ; uncle John
to??k him hack to Randolph where he
made his second season; the third season
he was brought to St. Johnsbtiry, and
stood at uncle David's again. Alter
this, I went to learn my trnde, I cannot
give so particular an account of the horse,
but remember that he was kept several
seasons in St. Johnsbui v.

Company, in compensation for injuries
sustained by the plaintiff, from the falling

1. That it was nojustificption to prove j
that the boat was constructed as boats
usually are, unless it was proved she was
safe and secure. Owners of public vehides
are required by law. to take great
mre, and use all necessary precaution ;
and defendants were wrong in supposing
that less care was required in regard to
persons than goods ; for good* they are
hy law accountable, unless they can show
that the loss arose from the act sf God or
tho King's enemies. This is the common
law, and the principles was equally applicable
here. Having charge of human
life, less cannot be required of the owners
of public vehicles.
2 That the proprietors of public conveyances
were bound to act impartially,
with respect to persons applying for passage,
though they could not legally take
one and refuse another, capriciously ;
yet they were bound to take no more than
can be taken with safety ; and of this the
proprietors, or their agents, are to be the
iudsos.

3. Passengers crowding into the boat,
and rushing upon the promenade neck in
unusual numbers, was not admitted to be
an excuse for the accident. The proprietors,
or agents, were bound to caution the
passengers?caution them of the danger
of proceeding, and, finally, to refuse to
goat all, if, in their opinion, the boat was

Texas.?Renewed Invasion.-t-We j
have before us the Austin Centinel
of September 30th, which contains an !
account of a Mexican invasion, or rather '
foray, committed in Refugio county, on
the night of Sept. 18th. The invading
party consisted of about fifty Mexicans;
the name of their commander was not
ascertained. They made a sudden descent
upon the town, and took possession
of it, helping themselves to every thing
they could lay their hands on, and carry
ing off eight prisoner*, among whom wero
the district clerk, the late sheriff, and a
justice of the peace.
Henrv Riol, one of the captives, made
a desperate resistance, killing one of the
Mexicans, and wounding t\* o others, before
he was overpowered. It is believed
that he was afterwards killed.
The Confine! adds:?,4The most unnatural
and horrible destruction of private
property followed. About $500 in
silver was taken from a widow, and also
$3000 worth of dry goods, household and
kitchen furniture, <fcc. &c. Chief Justice
iNeill and two other men made their escape
to a neighboring wood, and the next
morning returned to see the desolation of
the town. It wore a frightful appearance;
women and children were in great distress,
having lost everything moveable;
and their husbands and fathers abducted
and carried away into foreign captivity.
Every thing looked desolate; feathers,
from the destruction of bedding, were flying
about the streets, making desolation
more desolate. Not an article moveable
was left to these unfortunate beings. The
only articles left in the town were three
barrels of whiskey?whether they feared
poison or drunkenness, is a matter of conjecture.
A Mexican who was released the next
day, represented rhev had 500 men four
leagues behind; that they had previously
taken San Patricio.

TRIAL OP EDWARD HOLING.
Edward Boling, the story of whose
villany has for some time filled the surrounding
country, was tried last Fridny
on an indictment for Bigamy, at the 8u
:c=?/
perior Court of Rockingham county, i
before his honor Judge Nash* The rare t
occurrence of the crime with which he
was charged, the respectability*of the '
parties suffering from it, and the novel
character of the circumstances attending
the commission of the offence, conspired
to draw together an unusually large!
crowd of spectators. But the trial, in > c
detail, turned out to be comparatively un- j ^
interesting. A very fmall portion of the ^
train of minute hut strange particulars,
marking the steps of the criminal towards
the accomplishment of his crime, was
elicited on the examination of evidence.
For the conviction of the prisoner it was rj
only necessary to prove his identity, and t
that he had a wife living before and at
the time of his second marriage; conse- t
quently the principal developements of L
the trial consisted in the proof of these a
barren facts. The case submitted to the | (
jury upon the charge of the Judge, and ?
a verdict of "Guilty" returned after an v
absence of a very few minutes. f
As time will not now permit us to at
* ? - I,
tempt a circumstantial nnrration nt thoi"
facts, as we heard them from the jtrial ^
and from other sources.
Edward Boling, the son of a worthy *
I Methodist minister of Caswell county, J
I was married to Miss Harriet Parks, of j
the same county, in July, 1888. He was ^
19 years of age in May preceding his j
marriage; h;s wife between 10 and 17. r
About the last of September or first of
October, 1840 a young man of genteel I
appearance and pretty good address nr. t
rived in Greensboro*, gavo his name as v
Sidney T. Smith, and said he was from
Perry county, Alabama. He went imine- 11
Jiately to the office of one of our lawyers H
and delivered a letter which purported to *
be from James Smith, of Ala., the writer 1
stating that he wished his son Sidney, J1
tho bearer, to prosecute the study of the
law to a certnin extent, so that he might
be enabled the better to manage a large
property that would eventually fall to
him. The letter contained some other r
fatherly suggestions relative to the gui-1 i<
dance of son Sidney, jusj as one would J
suppose an easy old planter to write. c
Young Mr. Smith secured hoarding in ^
a respectable family ; paid about as much 6
attention *o Coke and Rlachstone ns is j!
generally looked for in a rich young hair- j
brained student; and commenced "cutting
tho gent'* in prosperous fashion. In j
the most natural way in the world he <
mentioned, upon suitable occasions, the (
vast possessions of the venerated Mr. f
James Smith, of Perry county, Ala. ami i
passed among his new acquaintances f
with all the ense of "heir presumptive" to f
an Alabama fortune. c
In December lie left the place on a
pretended visit to certain wealthy rela- ^
tions in Nottoway, Virginia, and did not *
I return until February, 1S41. In thrt *
moan tImp n Intlrr was received bv one
[of his creditors from a pretepdod uncle j *
of young Mr. Smith, elating that hi.-s f
return whs prevented by the illness of his ^
servant. ,
After h is return from this jaunt, some j
time ?n the month of March, he received $
the astounding and grievous intelligence [
of the death of his father in the south- j
west, fie exhibited a letter containing I c
this information >vith marks of most sin. '

mourned as a dutiful son for the sad event (
that had thus early in life burdened him (
with the care of a fortune;?and forthwith
began to "surge his credit" in the %
stores, tailor shops, &c, c
In the mean time he had formed an a
acquaintance with the family of Mr. r
Branitock, of Guilford county, and an (
intimacy with his daughter, which, on her 0
part, riponed into affection, and he asked a
??- n j?<i., ?
her hand in marriage. i*ir. ?. pruucnuv r
inquired into the character and circum- a
stahces of his proposed son-in-law; the fi
investigation turned out satisfactory; and f1
the marriage was consummated in May, 11
1841.?Mr. Smith being anxious to have 1
it over, aud go with his lady out to his n
bereaved mother. F
During the summer he concluded to
settle in Caswell, N. CM having the offer ,
of a valuuble tract of Lnd from E \ward
Bolinjfi and induced Mr. Brannock to as- j
sist him with his namo in procuring a loan
of money, until ho could realize some of
his Alabama fortune. The land trade
continued to be canvassed until Mr. B. J
began to suspect that all was not right,
asked an explanation of Smith, who con- c
fessed that Boling, had managed to swin- s
die him out of a large part of his money, '
wunoui giving nun a line iu mw muu? j
Mr. B. fi nally had Boling arrested at Cas. (
well courthouse, and ascertained to his ?
c
astonishment and dismay tbnt he was the j
same man who had married his daughter
under the name of Sidney T. Smith.
The villain continued up to the time of j
his arrest to pass in Caswell as Edward, f
Boling, and in Guilford as Sidney T. ^
Smith. His last wife, the daughter of
Mr. B., at one time becoming uneasy at (
the protracted absence of Mr, Smith,
went to the house of the elder Mr. Boling, j
expecting to find there her husband in j
company with young Mr. Boling, of whom t
he was purchasing land. But young r
Mr. Boling, on seeing her carriage, was (
taken suddenly, i//, could see no one, and
passed the night in a room with his true ?
wife,?no one but himself suspecting the l
strange connexion existing among the t
company then under his father** roof. |

this strange affair. We have no space (

It will be well if this tendency stops

Major General Winfield Scott has pubished
a long letter, in reply to many leters
he had received, avowing his opinions
>n most of the agitating questions of the
lay, and concluding as follows:
"Finally. I am asked, if nominated ai
i candidate for the Presidency, would yoi
iccept the nomination ? I beg leave re
ipectfully to reply, Yes; provided that 1
)8 not required to renounce any princi
)le professed above. My principles ar<
;onvictions."
The General declares that, althougl
Dred to arms, from early manhood, he hai
always taken an interest in political af
fairs; that he was opposed to the aliei
' and sedition lavs, an advocate of the wef
of 1812 against Grtat Britain, and a gyp*
porter of the Administration of JairiDw*
and Madison. He avows a deep revprence
for the judiciary, state and federal*
as an independent department of the gofernment;
and holds the decision of tha
Supreme final and conclusive, on all
doubtful questions, arising under the con*
stitution or lavs of the Union, unless ret
versed on a rehearing before the sama
tribunal. Ho favors a limitation of the
executive veto and of executive patronage.
He is opposed to Removals from of.
fice on political grounds. He is oppoaed
to any pledge against a second term, be.
cause 44 it looks too much like a bargain
tendered to other aspirants?yield to
now, I shall soon be out of your way
but he favors an amendment of the constitution
denying re-eligibility to the Presidency,
and extending the term to si*
years. As to the. ?ading measures of tha
late extra session of Congress, he sav*:-?
*4 If I had had the honor of a vote on
the occasion, it would havo been given in
favor of the land distribution bill, the
bankrupt bill, and the second bill for creating
a fiscal corporation?having long
been under a conviction that, in peace aa
in war, something efficient, in the nature
of a bank of the United Statee, is not on
ly 44 necessary and proper," bat indispensable
to the successful operations of the
Treasury, as well as m'any of the wants
of our commerce and currency*" '

We^give place, below, to a common i. %
cation nominating Mr. Wakdlaw for the Presidency
of this institution, and copy,
from the South Carolinian, a communi*
cation to that paper, nominating Chan*
ceilor Job Johnsok for the same office.
Wo still hope the heofth of President
Barnwell may bo ao far restored as to
enable him to discharge the duties of this
important office, and that'lie may be
prevailed upon to accede to the very gene*
ral and ardent wish of the whole State,
by again accepting the appointment from
the trustees. Should this, however, not
be the case, an election of some other
person will probably lie made during the
approaching session of the Legislature.
The great popularity and prosperity of
the college for several years past are to be
ascribed mainly to the decidedly rrligioue
character of President Barnwell and Pro.
i fessor Elliot. We are very far from
,! meaning any disparagement to the other
| respectable professors who were associated
with them, or to the other qualifications
for which they were themselves distinguished
Neither do we' mean that religious
character alone would satisfy the
public. What we do mean is that other
j qualifications^ however, eminent, wouid
not satisfy the public, as past experience
most abundantly proves. If the trustees
wish the prosperity and usefulness of the
. College to continue, thev must continue
at its head a man distinguished as well
for piety as for talents and literature.
If oast experience proves any thing it
proves this.
For the^,ar^nera, Gazette.
Mr Editor. 1 have witnessed with moeh ^
pleasure the deep interest which seems to
pervade the pre?* in our stats in relation to
the future direction and prospec's of our college.
The institution, under the auspices of
wise legislation has assumed an enviable
standing among her sister colleges! and pub*
lie nvoney cannot be laid out more advaotageously,
nor produce a richer harvest in any
other field, than this. It is deeply, to be regretted
that President Barnwell could a*>t
have been retained in the position which he
filled with so much ability and success. The
1* #
public confidence will not however be impau
ed if a proper person is selected to fill this
vacancy. The time is approaching whet
the Board of Trustees *il< be called upoa te
make this selection. Hitherto hopes have
been entertained, that Mr. Barnwell would be
enabled, upon the restoration of his health, te
resume his place. These hopet are fallacious,
and all eyes are busy in the look out for a
suitable successor; as such I have determined
upon the Hen. L. D. Wa-dlaw. I know not
what are the prospects of obtaining the serti.
ces of this distinguished individual The
station is one of high responsibility and conae?
qusntly of high honor?none more to. It baa .
occurred to me, that nc ono in our State
answers the cobs of the institulioo so we!L
He is a South CaroliniaA ; graduate of the
college well known; a gentleman of .fine
literary taste and fond of literary pursuits.
The high character of thte individual would
give him at once the confidence of Parents
And Uuardians, wnnsi an prawu*
would be the guarantee of his future success.
His fine address, polite manners, and firm
control would secure to him tho respect and
esteem of those under his gorernment, His
, moral character is of that onexceptionable
cast which would meet general approbation;
? and in fioe he seems to hare erery qualifies.
