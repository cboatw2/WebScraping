We take the following icu <Vcsprit from
the Boston 44 Post" as not inapt to the
times. We ought to mention that the
Ourang was sold at Auction for $1000.

proposition was made that the Ourangi
Outang advertised to be sold by Mr. Tyler,'
the Auctioneer, on the day following,
shouid be rescued, as the slaves were from
under the nose of the honorable Chief
Justice, last summer. It was clearly
ploved that the Ourang was an ornament
to human society?a being highly endowed
with intellectual powers, and as capable
of appreciating and enjoying the blessings
c?f freedom as George Thompson himself.
The ladies present appeared to take a deep
interest in several anecdotes, related by.
one of the speakers, of the alfectionate
nature of this abused portion of the ^human
family." One ol them (Henry Fitzgerald
Augustus Outang) fell in love with
jiii white lady, and finding his advances rcejected,
actually died of a broken heart,

girl standing at her father's door, seized
her, and bore her to " his lofYv iioine in!

led her with cocoa nuts, tor three weeks,!
when his captive escaped and rehired to j

1'he propositicn to rescue before the sale,
however, was finally rejected?it being
thought more consistent with the principles
of the Society to restore Mr. Outang
to liberty after the purchaser hail paid his
money for him and by that means a suffering
fc4low creature would not only be
relieved from the hand of a hard-hearted
master, but the muster punished lor his
sin in dealing in Outang llcsh, by being j
robbed of his property. What the final
result will he, time only can determine.
OUTANG IS YET. IN CHAINS!! !
fiOVHU.VOli S j
Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House
of Representatives'.
Iu exercising, at this season, my constitutional
authority of convening the Legislature,
I cannot assign 110 other considerations
in vindication of the propriety
of my course, than such as have already
addressed themselves, with melancholy
force to the heart of every citizen in the
State. The few suggestions I shall offer
1 . . 1 ii.a ii* .1
arc suommeu wan an me aeiorcnco moi
is due to the superior wisdom of the body
that I have the honor of addressing.?
They are impressed upon my mind by
much and anxious reflection on the results
* that may flow from the calamity that has
brought us together. The whole plant*
ing and commercial interests of our couu
try arc involved in those of Charleston.?
She is our seaport, our emporium, our
pride. She is the very heart of our great
Western Rail Road, the outlet and channel
of all our direct importing trade. A
check to her prosperity is a blight upon
the health, the strength, the glory of the
whole State.
It is not my desire to awaken your sympathies
by a detail of individual suflcring,
great as it may be; nor by painting the
melancholy scene of irresistible destruc*
tion which I witnessed upon the spot. A i
general summary of the extent of this (lis-!
aster is enough. One hundred and fortyfive
acres, of the richest part of Charleston,
arc now clothed in ruin. Properly
to the amount of three or four millions
has I ecu utterly destroyed, a very small
portion of which was insured out of the
city. Some of the insurance offices will
exhaust their whole capital, the portion of
orphans and widows, to meet their liabilities;
and the less has fallen severely upon
all. One thousand buildings in the commercial
part of the town are levelled to
the ground. Five thousand souls arc driven
trorn the shelter of their homes; of
whom a large portion arc without employment,
and perhaps one third without the
MCon*-- I t obtaining daily bread except
I from charity. The total annihilation of
the resources of men in business will drag
' into the common ruin, their creditors who
have aided them with funds, for the prosecution
of their useful occupations. It is
difficult to estimate the number of those,
as well without, as within the city, who
may be saved from the hoplessncss of utter
destitution by the timely proffer of
yuur ueipiug naiKI.
As our in tlier oily, consecrated in the
direction of every patriot by the proudest
associations of his countiy's history,
Charleston is entitled to the pious cure
ami filial regard of the State. A nation
loses caste that will abandon the objects
of its ancient pride and veneration, and
becomes degraded in its own eyes, and before
the world. Whether the citizen consults
his glory or his*interest, the fate of
ine metropolis is his; tier prospe rity is
his prosperity?her decay is his disgrace
and shame.
I have already hin'edat tlie probable effects
of the lute ca ani y upon the pr>?spects
of our great Kail Ruttd, and of ihe
noble scheme of Direct Importations.?
These two indeed niuv he regarded us tm<
great engine for the exchange of the
wealth of Europe and the West; reaching
with one urn. over the declivity ??t mountains,
with the other su mounting the no
less formidable hurries of established custom.
Are not these ruly national institutions?
I* ll.il tlm *il.. .. ..I...I 1 ?
..... .iiv .-Kin |iiriigru III IIIIHOr
and interest to support them? l)o they
not involve the prosperity of every inch
of her territory and every individual of
her population? South Carolina was the
foremost to commence, to urge, to sustain
and cherish these wise undertakings.
Shall South Carolina now be the first to
abandon them? But Charleston is the
centre of their existence, from her alone
they can derive life and useful activity.?
If she pines unaided, they too must dwindle
and decay; if she sinks, they must tall
with her ruin, leaving only tneir mommy
as u lasting reproach to the weak vanity
that in so grand a projeol failed so miser jhlv
~-J
Public and private sympathy have nobly
performed their ollice by muuificci contributions
for the relief of those who are
reduced to want. Disdaining ihe calculations
of sordid policy, and yielding to
,the generous impulse of an elevated social
feeling, hvul cities have advanced
rwith prompt magnanimity to the reliel of
Charleston.? Prom almost every State in
the Union, and more especially from e?ory
city and village in the Stale of Georgia,
the most substantial evidence i as
been received of a deep feeling for our
allliction. But all that charity can effect
is the relief of iudividuil distress. Thousands
have been cuniiibutcd, but thousands
cannot replace the loss of millions.

and erase the vestiges of ruin.
You arc urged then by every motive to
lly to the assistance of your suifering city
Yon will not let her sinlt, now, in the
sis of her struggles. But your
aid, to be efficient, must be promptly afforded.
Delay and disappointment at tins
season may lead to irretrievable mischiefs,
such as 110 time can repair. You can
now prevent evils which you may never
have it in your power to remedy. You
:;vy prevent valuable citizens from yielding
to dependency, and leaving the State
iDfiri\ I'uijjioymem miner Kinucr auspices.
Yon may propent foreign trade from deserting
your ports (or those where prosperity
will inspire greater confidence.?
We may do this now; but a few months
hence might he loo late. Stripped of her
trade, drained of her capital, deserted by
her improverisli citizens, her spirit chilled
and sickened by disappointment, she
might fall a rapid victim to our delay, a
sad monument of the baneful effects of
indecision.
If the citv were to he saved by the gratuitous
donations of millions from the
public treasury, the money would be
wisely spent. lint let it not be imagined
that 1 recommend, or that Charleston tie

The State by pledging her faith ran command
the necessary means at once; and
will she refuse ij when site has every reasonable
assurance that she will h tally run
the shadow of a risk? I feel assured there
cannot be a division of opinion upon this
subject.
Believing that there will he no difference
of sentiment in regard to the main .
object of our present consideration, I refrain
from entering into details which j
might distract your counsels and tend to
disturb that harmony which it is infinitely
desirable should be preserved on tl.c delicate
occasion. Two or three millions, to

may suggest, and loaned on proper security

instil into her veins, it might yet he the
instrument of converting an apparent
curse into a real blessing. Hut whatever
tnay be done, you should cautiously provide
against the recurrence of similar disasters.
Your benefactions should he so
conditioned as to issue the erection of edifices
not easily combustible. A city
whose history may be traced in conflagrations,
should not be indifferent to the consuming
lessons of experience. The insecurity
arising from its c ose compacted
wooden buildings bay been one of the
greatest tariers to Its improvement, and a|
principal stumbling; block in the way of.
its ambition of becoming the main commercial
centre of the South.
Sotil'i Carolina has yet proved equal to
every crisis. May she not now falter in a
noble course, prompted by generous impulse,
ami sanctioned by a prudent policy.
That which to the superficial observer
abroad will appear to be only the liberal
dictate ot deep and provident wisdom.

The Boston papers aro circulating an anecdote
some thing to this elFect of President IIusjpiirev, of
Amherst College. lie entered the Hall one mornining
to hear hi< class, and found that some wag
a ' f.istcn< d a goo o in his presidential chair. He m
ook no notice of tno suppressed laug iter that was "
going the rounds, but simply turned 011 his heel and
loft the room, with tf.> remark that the class scorned
to stand in no need 01 iiis instruction that morning, ^
since they had provided themselves with a substitute i .
so abundantly qualified to instruct them.
We c m l>eat this with a similar one about Dr. Coo-; I
rEn. During thovacanco of the cliaplainey,thc Dr.was
in tlto habit of reading prayers before the students, .
a the ccustoincd hour. On ono occasion he found j
the pulpit pro-occnpiod by an unfortun te calf, that, ?
w!ion he entered, w is bawling away most iteously.
The poor tiling was speedily (lit mi fixed from its pun- .
toral ch'irge, and sent olf to the barn yard. After
its removal the students sat in awful silence, expecting
momentarily somo terrible denunciation to be J
levelled nl the concealed author of the outrage.? ^
Tiie pause continued unbroken, un'til one of tho pro l
r : ? ? 1 ---a ?i i-!- __ ? ....
icksuip, in iiiu pii [iiuiuc ui ins sympathy, wishing,
also to represent tiio otTcnce us void of any personal
bearing, asked what could possibly have moved the
students to such a foolish, unmeaning, nonsensical r|
trick. " 1 really can't imagine," said the Dr. mil- ?
singly, " unless it was their exceseivc fondness for i
representative government."
In a debating sociely in North Carolina, the '
question was recently debated, "ought public oxo. *
cutions to be performed in private." *
The Baltimore papers bring accounts of a serious
tornado in that city. The destruction of property
was quite extensive. The zinc roof upon tho new
Christ Church, was blown oil" and rolled no into a
scroll as if by tho influence ot sumo powerful ma- '
chiuery. Tho shipping, generally, escaped with. ,
out injury.
