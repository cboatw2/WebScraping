From what we learn fromn some of the
districts'in this State where at the last elec
tion for the Legislature, a regular parta
contest was mamntained, we are induces
to believe, that it is not intended to be re
newed this sunmmer. In Abbeville, wi
understand, that party lines will not be
drawn, there being yet but one candidat<
of the whig faith in the field, and a de~ter
mination being expressed by many here;"a
fore active paraizan, not tao be influe~nces
in their vastes by party considermations.
The majority in the State is so great, than
eve if some three or fuur districts should
after a regular party contest, elect whij
members, they would constitute such
small minority as to be powerless. Unde
these circutmstances, and from the addi
tional one, that no election can be held Co

Attention has already been d
correspondent, to the re-organizatioe
Congressional Districts, w-hich must-de
volva upon the neat Legislature, and it is
therefore an appropriate lime Io present to
our readers, the statistiis of our population
in a form bearinq directly on thisquestion:
The Consitunon of the United States
says:
"Representation and direct taxes, shall
be apportioned among the several Sta1er
which may be included in this Union, ac
cording to their respective number: which
shall be determined by adding totks sole
number of Jree periss, including ttiose
bound to service for a term of years, and
excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of
all other persons."
The representarive populaons will these
fore be determined by taking the whole
number of free persons, nd adding thereto
3-5ths of the slaves. And first of -the
whole State. The free population. (inciu
ding 'ree colored,) amounts to 267,360.
The whole slave population is M7,038,
which, in Federal numbers,oreesea
tive power, equals 196, -2. ThO era
Representative population of tiie8tte is.
tuerefore 463,2.
By the Apportionment Bill which isnor
a law, South Carolina has seven Repre '
e sentatives in Congress. Dividing her
0 Federal Numbers by seven, we have 66,
226, as the ratio of Representation foour
-. State. From the tables of the last censs
r published in the American Almane, we
have made out a new table, which pro-,
e sents opposite tee number of each District,
frst, the free popolation. rcond te Slaves,
and third the Federal Numbers. We have
not followed the AlphabeticaNl order, but
arranged the Districts as they lie on- the
' map, beginning with the Sea-board.

Editors Repubwen a nnna&
Gentlemen :--Your informant is not
mistaken in his views relative to "public
opinion,'' in the Bridge case. He can
Isay, tmoreuver, thartif the case had been
left to a Jury. a verdict would have been
a wtarded to Mr. Shuhma withesat leaving
their seats.
sYour correspondents "Eye !~e
seed Friends of Truth," say, teem
ow whoe expected to receive mode @
JMr. :Shuhtz in the event of his kce.
- 'a huse hopes were bias~erd when they heard
t the testmonuy ; that on behalf of the defent
,dants being extremely well arranged, and'
conclusively showing the injustice of Mr.
aShulta's claim." True! the Lastimony
of Lthree witnesses; the same number of
sour l,:ater writers, seem to have succeeded
r better before you, than before the Chance!
- lr.
. There is no accounting for the depravity
, of mankind these days, in their doing and
ayings, even of those of high or low dere
espectin the godor badl luck o1 the
omen4, of M. Shults's Counsel not up~
pearing, and the State B~ankhrSouthCaria
e ina with drawing from ,,or
respondents or any one . I
come to all the benefls g tere
from.
tA bout a pair ofhorsesrunn)ingCaway'wit'
a carriage, this is true. But In this afair,
aMr. Shults has acted as apy honest man
shol do,tfor he hasnmade (nil and isatis
factory arrangements with the owner there
fof, without being whipt into it by the pen
alty of the law.
sAs for the firing of Mr. Shnltz's cannon,
your correspondents are entirel mistaken,
as uu,min saying. that it sa s defUJoue
I for the ultimaten suces nthe case. lItwas
,for two facts actually obtained-the one isa
,trial. and the other sujfuir tril, nestherof.
-which. the opposite party intended thathe
ever should have.
