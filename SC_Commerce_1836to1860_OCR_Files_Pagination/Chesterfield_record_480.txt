Success in Silk Growing. j J
Wo have made a collection o\' facts, j
from various papers, as to the success in f{
silk growing in dilfcrcnt parts of the 1 1
country, which wc think sufficient to
warrant our saying, that tli^ro is no doubt j
W whatever of its becoming of equal importance
with cotton growing, and far more
than sufficient to counteract the evil ten- .
tlency of such articles as one that appear- ' {
oJ in a recent num!>er of one of our first 1 <
agricultural pajicrs, the "Firing's Cu!>:- i
net," where the principal argument made ! <
use of was, the effeminacy character of the 1
employment, rendering it unworthy the | 1
attention of men!

The Darlington Silkworm Record (
says:
Mr. Daniel Snaulding of Hancock. N. 1
H., is preparing to put up our improved .
Frame in his cocoonery.
Mr. R. Shore of Mon;:*, m i He, Va. has;
built a cocoonery largo enough to feed j
300 000 w.-.rni^.
Mr. John R. H'irt, of Sro't's F**rry, | 1
Va., writes us lor in for ma: ion as tr> cost
of delivering frames at Richmond, s'h- '
I
ting that he has some expectation of
building a cocoonery, this winter, 51 by j
27 feet.
Mr. L. A. Spalding writes from Lock- '
port, N. Ym as follows?
Hi have paid some attention to the silk
' business, and had foliage sufficient to feed j
a large number of worms the past summer i
but could n?t get the eggs. I have now j '
a supply. In feeding I have had goo.I j ]
success, nnd in reeling beyond my ex pec-1
tatton. The whole operation is so simple j 1
that its success is no longer doubtful. It : '
1 I
is settled that the country will supply j ,
iteHf with a large portion of its conxutnp-j
tion in few years."
From the Rev. John Foster, of Lebanon,
Ohio, we have received the follow-;v
?g- !
I have been trying to make, a little silk s
now for two or three years. I have done i
as well as I expected, according to my
means- Indeed I have not attempted
any thing but to learn the habits of the i
worms, until the past summer. This sum- I
mcr I fed all I could get, which was very
few. They did well, except an early i
brood which was fed upon the native mulberry."
I
From Louisiana we have accounts of <
several gentlemen embarking in the bu>i- : i
ness. Great success may be expected in ) i
that delightful climate. ! ;
||r. Frederick Brownell, So. West port,
Mass., obtairel 15 bushels of cocoons
the present season, from about 60,000 i
worms.
Mr. N. E. Chaffee, of Ellington, Conn,
writes as follows?
*'I have fed worms this sea-on. obtain. <
ed 20 bushels of cocoons, though fed wholly
on board shelves. Bv what I can I 1
gather from the riptior. of vo?tr frame i
in the Record, J thinjc very favorably of! <
it." <
