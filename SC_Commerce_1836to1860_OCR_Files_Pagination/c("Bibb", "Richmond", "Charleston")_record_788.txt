The Congaree mission does hot appear in the
aboyp table, because it is not yet a year since it
was commenced. A letter from the missiomuy,
however, gives a good account of its commence*
tnent; and the character of the field warrants
the expectation of a fair report-at the close of the
year. And the mission to the rice plantations on
Savannah river, is not set down, because, that mis
sion having been connected with the Georgia Con
ference till last year, the documents necessary to a
I showing of its progress are not at hand. ’
You will perceive, that notwithstanding the dis
continuance of the Cape Fear mission from 1836 to
1840, inclusive, and of Pee Dee mission in 1839 and
1840, and the omission of the numbers for Man
chester mission the last two years, the aggregate
number of church members has been constantly in
creasing from the beginning till last year, when
there was a decrease of 190. The average annual
net increase previously, had been about 480. And
the same with respect to the whole numbers of chil
dren catechised. The report of these for last year,
shows a decrease of 203, whilst the average an
nual net increase previously, had been about 340.
This is explained fully by one word, “ Retrench
ment.’’ At the conference before last, this was a
governing word ; and considering how much it had
to do, we should be glad to believe that this reduc
tion of numbers will prove to have been the sum of
the evil Wrought. \\
// I would invite your attention to the consideration
'' /of the influence of these missions on the labours of
the circuits and stations of the conference district
generally, to produce an increase beyond the pro
ceeds of their respective fields. Observe, they all
lie out of the way of the circuits, where no Metho
dist minister would have access to the negroes on
their circuit rounds ; and therefore, their numbers
are just so many added to the yearly conference re
turns over and above any numbers gathered, or that
would be gathered, by the circuit preachers. But
though locally so distinct and detached from the cir
cuits, I apprehend they exert a strong influence on
the whole body of the preachers of the conference,
in favour of this class of our population; inducing
greater care for their spiritual welfare, and, of
course, greater pains to bestow on them the bene
fits of the gospel ministry. At the close -of the
year 1828, when our firtt missions to Santee and
Combahee and Poison were instituted, the whole
number ot colored cnurcn mernoers m me uouuus
of the South Carolina deference district was
15,997. Our last conference returns exhibited the
number of 27,090 colored church members in the
circuits and stations, besides 6,110 in the missions,
making an aggregate of 33,200 in the conference
district; considerably more than doubling the num
ber when the missions were commenced, though
that number was then considered large. The
whole number of colored church members in all
the conferences of the connection at that time, was
62,814 and in all those of the slave-holding states,
besides South Carolina 38,024. The South Caro
lina Conference included Georgia and Florida, but
I give the numbers according to the present boun
daries, limiting the South Carolina Conference to
the state of South Carolina and that part of North
Carolina which lies south of Cape-Fear river, except
Wilmington. Within these bounds, at the close of
1828, there were 15,997 colored church members,
while there were in Georgia and Florida, 5,847.
The Virginia Conference, (then comprehending
the present North Carolina Conference, as well as
Virginia,) reported 9,756 ; the Baltimore Confer
ence 10,302 ; and the next largest number in any
conference in the slave-holding states, was that of
Kentucky, where they reported 3,682. Compare
the proportion between the territories of the South
Carolina district, extending from Cape Fear to Sa
vannah River, (on one hand.) and the whole extent
of the slave holding states from Maryland to Loui
siana, and from Georgia to Missouri, (on the other,)
or between the entire numbers of the colored pop
ulation in our conference district, and in all the
rest of that vast field together—to show how large
a proportion our 15,997 bore to the whole 38,204
church members. But in any view our compar
t \ ative number of colored church members was
\ : large.) When we reported 15,997 colored, the
v whiles in the same bounds were only 18,469;
while in the Virginia Conference the numbers
stood 9,756 to 28,384, in the Baltimore Confer
ence 10,302 to 28,644, and in the Kentucky
Conference, 3,G82 to 23,888. And the comparative
ministerial efficiency of these conferences has been
decidedly against South Carolina; as the number
of ministers in each, has been in proportion to the
number of their whites, and not colored, members.
, 1 think the field, for example, of the Virginia Con
ference, (now Virginia and North Carolina Confer
ences,) has employed about as many more preach
ers than that ot the South Carolina Conference,
since 1828, as this proportion calls for—say as many
as 28 to 18. I suppose, too, that in that field, the
preachers have had as ready access to the colored
population as iu this ; and that there have been as
many colored people lor mem to preacn to. now
then shall the fact he accounted for, that the I
larger field, with the greater number of ministers, ]
which reported the number of 9,756 colored mem
bers in 1828, reports the still less number of 8,940
in 1842; while the smaller field, with fewer preach
ers, which reported the number of 15,997 colored
members in 1828, reports now the still greater
number of 33,2001 See how different this result
' is from that of their labours among the whites in the
same time. Where they had, in the larger field
28,384 white members ot the church, they now
have 43,568; and where we had, in the smaller
field, 18,469, we now have 29,887. This increase
of white members in the two fields, tallys well with
the comparative number of ministers employed in
each of them; the larger field with more labourers
yielding 14,184, while the smaller field, with fewer
labourers, yields 11,418. But while the equal effi
ciency of the ministry in these two fields is thus
fairly proved, for the whites, what does a decrease
of 816 in one, and an increase of 17,200 in the other,
tell with respect to the colored population 1* A
///’2. With regard to the opinion of the planters re-.
- specting our missions, we might point to the contin
uance and spread of them as proof that it is favora
*'\ble. At first we had to solicit a trial; but for some
years past, the planters, in most instances, have
V solicited us. They are always wealthy gentlemen,
« of high character; and not a few of them, bearing
the best honors of the state. I hope it will not
give offence that I mention the names of the Hon.
♦ If other causes exist for this disparity, besides the
fhvorable influence exerted by the missions in South
Carolina, I would venture, with confidence, to assign a
chief part on the other side, to the practice of encourag
ing the negroes to conduct public worship in separate
congregations from the whites. A practice this, which
prevails, more or less, in all the other conferences except
South Carolina, where tho policy always has been to
worship together in the same churches. It may seem
kind to set them ofl'in separate houses by themselves; but
I am persuaded that it is not so in fact. We soon forget
to care for them ; and they, to feel their interest in us.
The more we are together, the better for them. Class
leaders, and class-meetings, they must have among them
selves'; but these, also, require as close an oversight of
the pastor as the white classes do, or even closer, for
their best prosperity,

But besides the evidence which is afforded in the
fact that our missions have been continued and
increasing for so many years on the plantations of
such men as the above; (and in 14 years there has
been but a single individual found to turn us off;)
it may be acceptable to add some brief extracts of
our published annual reports, to show the favour
with which Pur labours hare been regarded.
Extracts.
u Voluntary testimonials from gentlemen of
highly respectable character and influence are be
fore the Board. ‘ We feel no ordinary gratification
in being able to testify,’ (says one of the communi
cations,) 'each one of us for his servants, that the
past year has presented, perhaps, unprecedented
manifestations of God’s goodness to his servants.
The happy effects of the ministrations of the mis
sionaries upon our servants, our eyes see; and our
ears not unfrequently hear their expressions of
gratitude for them.’ Another communication from
a most respectable source, informs us, that, ‘ since
the preaching of the missionaries, a marked change
is observable in the negroes. The mask of hypo
crisy is no longer used as a cloak for vice; the ne
cessary discipline of the plantation is maintained
through moral influence, and the amount of crime
has been abundantly lessened.”—Report, Febru
ary Is/, 1833.
“ From all our missions the Board has received
satisfactory letters from the planters concerned.
And though some of them cover too much ground
to admit of the work being done to the best advan
tage, still the most beneficial results follow the
labours of the brethren at every place.”—Report
Januarv 15th. 1838.
“ It affords the Board a high gratification to state,
that no declension is witnessed in the confidence
of the gentlemen who have invited and encouraged
the labours of your missionaries among their peo
ple. No abatement of their interest in, and satis
faction with our modes of religious operation is
feared. On the contrary, through the blessing of
God, a wider door, a larger field, is invitingly open
ed before us year by year. Old and tried friends
continue fast in their support; new and influential
friends swell the ranks. Cheering communications
come to us, signed by many of the most honored
names in the land.—Report, January lltft, 1841.
“ The continued approval and co-operation of the
planters, as well as the interest taken in these things
by the negroes themselves, affords the highest
gratification, and gives assurance, by the blessing
of God, of abundant success.”—Report, January
31st, 1842.
“ And now the call for more labourers is waxing
louder and louder. The fields are white to the
harvest; and the only regret which the Board ex
periences, is, that the means within their control
are not adequate to the entire work as spread out
before them. For several years past the mission
ary treasury has been embarrassed with debt, and
the Board have been under the necessity of cur
tailing, as far as possible, the expenses of our opera
tions. We trust however, that as God is opening
up the opportunities of more extensive usefulness
before them, the church will come up to their help,
and furnish the facilities for the occupancy of
every field.”—Report, February 13th, 1843.
I might multiply extracts to almost any length,
but I presume the above will answer, and I would
hot seem to weary you. Any suggestions on the
mode of conducting these missions, 1 must defer to
another time.

Most sincerely Yours,
W. Capers.
Charleston, August 26th, 1843. ..
t It may be satisfactory to some persons to know, (and
we certainly feel most free to avow the fact,) that of the
gentlemen proprietors, whose names are given above,
there is not one a Methodist.' And, indeed, I doubt if
there is one of our own denomination to be found alhong
the entire number of our patrons from Cape-Fear to Sa
vannah River, except perhaps one on Congarce and one
or two on Pee Dec. As said before, these fields lie out of
tlie range of Methodist circuit preaching in Carolina.

Rev. W. M. Wightmaru—Dear Brother,—You
published in the Advocate last week an article,
headed “A Missionary Disappointed,” &c., and
signed anonymously, which I deem too good to
pass without further notice. Such facts as are set
forth in that article, ought not to be left under the
slightest shadow of suspicion, but authenticated in
the most unquestionable form. And although I
feel the kindest allowance, and even esteem, for
the motives of our brother in using an anonymous
signature, I do not hesitate to lift the veil and
discover the individual, whose case affords so strik
ing an instance of the special providence ofAlmighty
God over his servants “ forsaking their own lives
also” in their master’s service.
The article mentioned was furnished by the Rev.
Nathan Byrd, of Pon Pon Mission, 30 miles S. W.
from this city. And the material facts are these.
Brother Byrd travelled Montgomery Circuit, in
Montgomery county, North Carolina, during the
year before last, and was there attacked with ague
and fever. Last year, he travelled Newberry cir
cuit, in Newberry District in this state, and was
. still the subject of this disease, which continued
into the winter season, and through the winter till
last spring. But at the session of our conference
in February last, the bishop, (I presume, not being
informed of the state of his health,) appoint ed him to
Pon Pon Mission; and this appointment was felt by
our brother to be a hard and unsuitable one, calling
for life itself in a cause in which he had already
lost his health. He was severely tried, but made
no complaint, applied for no change, and went to
his appointment, thinking this the clearest path of
duty, and choosing at all hazards to resign himself
to the providence of God as indicated in the order
of the church. The issue has been as stated in
the above mentioned anonymous article. His ague
and fever left him, and in the rice-field swamps of
Pon Pon (Edisto) river, brother Byrd has regained
his health, which is better than ever before.

ness, and for his wonderful works to the children of
men.” W. Capers.

CENTENARY INSTITUTE, ALA. CON.
At the late meeting of the Trustees of the Cen
tenary Institute, the undersigned were directed to
inform our friends and the ,public, of its present
state and prospects.
The Board are happy in being able to inform the
public, that they have succeeded in securiitg the
services of Rev. Professor Mitchell, late of Emory
College, Ga., as President of the Institute, who,
aided by able assistants, will open the next session
on the sixteenth of October. ,
From the long and successful experience of Prof.
M. as a teacher in different institutions, the Board
feel that they can, with the utmost confidence, re
commend the school to the patronage of their friends
and the public.
Both departments of the Institute will be under
the supervision of Prof. M., who will have charge
of their general government, order, studies, &c.—
There will be but one session per annum, commen
cing October 16, and continuing ten months, with a
vacation of a week or ten days at Christmas. The
terms of tuition will continue as heretofore, $25,
30 and 40 per session, according to studies. Board
can be had in any family in the neighbourhood for
$10 per month, including fuel, lights, washing, so
that $150 may very reasonably be expected to cover
the whole expense of Board, Tuition, School
Books, &c. As the success of the enterprise will
depend mainly on the assistance it receives from
the members of the Conference, we beg their hear
ty co-operation. Brethren, bring it before your
people, recommend it to their patronage, and try
and send us a large number of pupils by the open
ing of the next session. Be so good as to publish
this notice to the people of your charge.
In behalf of the Board,

GENERAL. INTELLIGENCE
FOREIGN.
The New Scotch Church has commenced ope
ration with great energy. It has directed immedi
ate attention to educational measures. The General
Education Committee, in the exercise of the powers
conferred on it by the General Assembly, and on
the report of its acting committee, made recently
the following appointments to chairs in the new
college in connection with the church:—
The Rev. Dr. Chalmers to be Principal and Pri
raarius Professor of Divinity.
The Rev. Dr. Welsh, Professor of Divinity and
Church History.
The Rev. Dr. Cunningham, professor of Divini
ty,—the special limits of the department to be af
terwards arranged.
The Rev. Dr. Duncan had been appointed Profes
sor of Hebrew and Oriental Languages at a former
meeting.
Dr. Cunningham is not to commence his course
of lectures till the session of 1844, and the commit
tee have requested him, in the meanwhile, to pro
ceed to this country in order to become acquainted
with the system of theological instruction followed
in some of the most eminent American universities.
The Nelson Monument.—The construction of
the Nelson monument, Trafalgar-square, the pro
gress of which was interrupted in consequence of
the Corinthian capital not being completed, has,
after a suspension of some months, been again pro
ceeded with. Monday the workmen began fixing
on the leaves and volutes of the capital, which
were cast at Woolwich dockyard, and which have
been upon the ground in Trafalgar-square some
days. Some of the leaves and volutes, which have
taken between two and three years for their exe-!
cution, weigh two and three tons. They have not
all yet arrived from Woolwich, but it is expected
the whole will be forwarded in the course of a
month; there will be then nothing to impede the
operations of the workmen, who have already pre
pared the stone work which will be necessary to
connect the capital upon which the pedestal will
have to be placed. The statue will be next raised,
but it will require another tier of scaffolding to be
erected for that purpose. The statue of this great
naval hero is nearly finished. It is composed of
two solid blocks of stone, and has been formed in a
temporary house on the ground by Mr. Bailey, R. A.,
from a design by Mr. Railton, who daily superin
tends its formation. It is expected that the monu
ment will be finished by the end of the year.
The Poor in England.—A letter from Bir
mingham, in the London Chronicle, gives a sad ac
count of the destitution prevailing in the neigbour
hood. The Chamber of Commerce held a meeting
to take into consideration the alarming state of the
country. To the question “ how are the poor main
tained—how do they live ?” the reply was, that they
could hardly belaid to live. They were complete
ly wasting off the earth for want of food ; they were
daily becoming unable to work from excessive weak
ness. Before they could commence work the em
ployers were obliged to order them food. One man
put to work had hardly commenced his labour when
he fell down, from entire weakness, and died in
two hours.
The Launch of the Great Iron Steamship.—
The great iron steamship “ Great Britain,” intended
for the trade between Liverpool and New York,
and the largest steamship ever built, was launched
with great pomp and ceremony on the 19th of July.
As it was well known that Prince Albert had accep
ted an invitation to be present, Bristol was thronged
with nobility and gentry from all parts of the king
dom. The Great Britain is a splendid floating-pal
ace every way. She will accommodate about 300
first class passengers, besides carrying 1500 tons of
goods. Her length is 320 feet, and her tonnage
3500. She is clinker built, and double riveted I
throughout. !
Affairs in Spain.—The Paris correspondent of
the National Intelligencer writes :—
“ Since the date of the letter in which I mention
ed Mr. Irving, the American Minister at Madrid,
we have recent and direct intelligence of him. He
had so far recovered from the malady with which he
was confined for several weeks as to be able to pass
days abroad on his feet and in his carriage, observing
the popular excitement and the preparations for de
fence. He felt not the least apprehension for him
self ; indeed, even the British ladies looked to his
hotel for refuge in case of an assault from the troops
at the gates. The cry without was Death to the
English ayacuchos ? as it had been on the former
revolution, Death to the Frenchified, Spaniards!'
The young Queen and her sister would gladly have
put themselves under the shelter of the American
Legation, rather than remain exposed in the palace
as a prize to the victors in a desperate street affray.
My informant mentions that, the only American
whom he knew to be in Madrid, end often with
Mr. Irving, was Mr. Sumner, of Boston, a gentle
man distinguished for personal merit and extensive
travel. Mr. Hamilton, of the legattion, was absent
in the Pyrenees.
“ Among the reflecting and best-instructed of the
foreigners at Madrid but one opinion prevailed ;
Espartero was deemed the only leader who could
acheive any stability of government and national
coherance; his popularity was, however,so far un
dermined by false charges, adapted to reigning pre
judices in the different divisions of the kingdom and
the municipalities, and subalterns in the army so
subject to corrupt influences, that, if he could have
triumphed over the insurrection, he would have
experienced great difficulty for any regular or tran
quil administration of affairs. Thisstruggle wascon
sidered the beginning of a new series of conflicts,
not merely for power m the Royal Government, but
for ascendedcy in the antagonist provinces, cities,
and even villages, and among the military forces,
split into political and personal parties, and driven
” •*
in different directions by numberless secret soci
eties.”
A Cruel Bondage.—A Benedictine Monk, fath
er Charles Berg, member of the celebrated Abbey
of Benedictines, at Melk, in Lower Austria, recently
put an end to his life by piercing his heart with a
poisoned stiletto. From letters which he wrote to
intimate friends on the day of his death, it appears
that he determined on committing suicide, from his
great weariness of the monastic life. He had twice
made a journey to Rome with the single object
of obtaining from the Pope a release from his vows.
He was forty-nine years old.
He is said to have been one of the most distin
guished writers of Germany, and had acquired great
fame as a critic. He was beloved, as much for the
qualities of his heart, as for those of his mind.
DOMESTIC.
The Narragansett Indians held one of their
religious meetings, a few days since, at their meet
ing house in Charlestown, Rhode Island, which, as
usual, at this time of the year, was very fully at
tended.—Many Indians from Long Island were
there, and great numbers of the white people were
present One of our preachers was from Long Is
land and another from Newport The committee
of the General Assembly met the tribe at the same
place for an interview on the subject of emigration
to Green Bay. Their land here, it was said, was
poor and exhausted ; thq land at Green Bay, where
their brethren were, was of the most exuberant
fertility. The committee had no doubt the assem
bly would aid such as wished to emigrate, but that
they did not wish to urge any to go unless they were
convinced it was for their interest; and if they
chose to remain, the General Assembly would con
tinue to protect them, as heretofore.—They conclu
ded not to emigrate.—Newark Advocate.
A Magnificent Boat.—There is a new steam
boat, The Knickerbocker, just completed in New
York, to run on the North River, which in dimen
sions and finish has no rival. She is three hundred
and twenty-five feet long, thirty-two wide, nine
feet nine inches depth of hold, and will measure
one thousand and forty-two tons; a greater amount
of tonnage than any other American steam vessel.
The hull is built unusually strong, in order that
she may run, if necessary, on other waters than the
Hudson. The main cabins below are three hun
dred feet in length, and are finished with three
hundred berths, sixty of which are in the state
rooms. The ladies’ saloon Is ninety feet long,
twenty-nine feet wide, and has sixty-four berths,
twenty-four of which are in twelve state rooms.
On the upper deck there are fifty-six state rooms,
extending on the sides of the boat from the pilot’s
wheel to the promenade deck, between which is a
large saloon, intended for a ladies’ and gentlemen’s
sitting room.
John Bull’s Notions of America.—The igno
rance of the English of everything respecting
America, is gross enough now, but a few years ago
it was past belief. When the eminent American
Poet, Halleck, was in England some years since, a
gentleman informs us that he was riding on a stage
coach and holding an animated conversation with a
clergyman of his acquaintance. Directly behind
him sat an English farmer, apparently a man well
to do, and of considerable intelligence, who could
not avoid overhearing the conversation, and seemed
to take an interest in it. At the first opportunity,
he asked Mr. Halleck, “ Are you an American, sir?”
“ Yes.”—“ Why, you talk very good English !”
said he, wonderingly. “ Yes,” said Halleck, with
his habitual turn for pleasantry, “ I flatter myself I
do speak it pretty well—I learned it for the purpose
of travelling in this country.” “ Oh!” exclaimed
the Englishman, serious and satisfied, and without
the remotest suspicion of a joke.
Greenocgh s noble statue of Washington,
which was injudiciously placed in the rotunda of
the Capitol, will soon be removed to an appropriate
spot in the grounds lying on the east side of the
Capitol. A paragraph in the National Intelligen
cer says:—
Passing through the East Capitol garden last
Saturday evening, we had an opportunity of viewing
and examining two immense blocks of Granite,
lately arr.ved from Quincy, Massachusetts, which
are intended, the one as a base, and the other as a
pedestial, for Greenough’s colossal statue of the
Father of his Country. These two large blocks of
granite weigh forty tons; they have been safely
placed within the temporary building that covers
the site of the magnificent statue. On one of the
sides of the pedestial is cut in large and well form
ed letters the inscription, “ First in the heart of his
countrymen.”
A Pattern Settlement.—The Edenton Sen
tinel says there is a small, secluded district named
‘ Croatan’ on the coast of North Carolina, separated
from the main land by marshes and the Croatan
Sound, which is believed to be without a parallel
on the globe. It contains about one hundred and
fifty inhabitants, nearly all are members of the
Methodist Church, and assemble for worship every
Sabbath; there are but two whodrink ardent spirits,
antjl all, to a man, are Whigs. There is not a store
or shop, doctor, lawyer, justice of the peace, coroner,
constable, or any other officer of any kind. If any
difficulty occurs among them, the matter is referred
to their friends, and they settle it. They live like
one family, and broils as seldom occur as they do in
the best regulated families.
Boston Schools.—In Boston they pay their
teachers well, and thus secure good schools. In
the Latin public school, the Principal has $3000 ;
Sub-master, $1500; Writing-master, $1000, and
two Ushers, one $800, and the other, $700.—Total
for the school, $6000.
In the English High School, the Principal has
$2000; Sub-master, $1500; three Ushers, $600
each.—Total, $5,300.
In the other fifteen public schools, each Principal
has $1500; and each Writing-master, the same.
The Ushers have $600; and the Female assist
ants, in each school, numbering from three to eight,
according to the size of the school, have each,
$250.
With such pay, men are willing to labour to pre
pare themselves for the situation, and having ob
tained it, are no less willing to labour to keep it.
Business in Clocks.—A gentleman called yester
day morning at the counting house of one of the
iron merchants of this city, to purchase fifty tons of
pig iron. In the course ot the negotiation, the mer
chant was led to inquire to what purpose the iron
was to be applied 1 “ To make weights for Yankee
clocks.” “ Why, what can you do with so many
clocks 1” “ They are shipped to England.” Think
of that! Fifty tons of iron for clock weights, each
clock requiring, probably, less than five pounds_
We 6aw it stated some time since in an English pa
per, that these clocks were being introduced into the
manufacturing districts of Great Britain and almost
every workman was becoming the owner of one of
them.—United Slates Gazelle.
Caterpillars.—Tho Tallahassee Sentinel of
the 22d inst. Bays:—There is, we fear, little doubt
that the Caterpillar is paying our planters the usual
triennial visit. In Jefferson, Leon and Gadsden, ar
mies of this destructive insect are already to work,
with ruinous effect. Their operations however, as
yet are confined to certain neighbourhoods in these
counties, but in all probability will soon become
general,—and as fatal perhaps, as in ’40. The way
these fellows will strip a Cotton field of every parti
cle of verdure is a perfect curiosity.
Worthy of Imitation.—The ladies of the Pres
byterian Church in Frankfort, Kentucky,—as we
learn by the ‘ Protestant Herald,’ published at that
place,—have lately purchased a parsonage for their
pastor, for which they have contracted to pay twenty
five hundred dollars in five years. The idea is an
excellent one, and commends itself to the imitation
of ladies in other places.
A Floral Curiosity.—We have often heard
of a white blackbird, but never till now of a green
rose; yet such a one has been produced in Bladen,
North Carolina. This change in the edour of the
| flower is supposed to have been affected by setting
out a common daily rose-bush in the spot from which
a sumac bush had just been removed, and it is be
lieved that the roots of the two mingled.—N. O.
Picayune.
Patino his Last Debt.—A constable in Wash
ington city, a few days ago, having a process for
debt to serve against an individual, called at the
house of the latter and asked if he was in. The
answer was in the affirmative, and having stated
that his errand was one of business, he was invited
to walk in, and was conducted into a dark and re
tired chamber, where lay the poor debtor, not in
the enjoyment of life and health, as was expected,
but clothed in the habiliments of death,—a corpse.
He had paid his last debt.
