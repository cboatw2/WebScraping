operation in thit quarter will soon cease.
The removal of the Indians from within
our settled borders is nearly completed.
The pension list, one of the heaviest charger
upon the Treasury, is rapidly diminishing
by death. The most cosily of our
public buildings ore cither finished, or
nsarly so; and we may I think, safely promise
ourselves a continued exemption ^
from border difficulties.
The available balunco in the Treasury
on the 1st of January next is estimated at
f one million and a half of dollars. This sum,
with the expected receipts from all sources
during' the next year, will it is believed,
be sufficient to enable the Government
to meet every engagement, and leave
a suitable balance in the Treasury at the
end of the year; if the remedial measures
connected with the customs and the public
lands, heretofore recommended, shall
be adopted, a?4 the new appropriations
by Congress shall not carry the expenditures
beyond the official estimates.
The new system established by Congress
for the safekeeping of the public
money, prescribing the kind of currency
to be received for the public revenue, and
providing additional guards and securities
gainst josses, has now been several
months in operation. Although it might
be premature, upon an experience of
such limited duration, to form a definite
opinion in regard to the extent of its influences
in correcting many evils under
which the Federal Government and the
country have hitherto suffered?especial,
ly those that have grown out of banking
expansions, a depreciated currency, ond
official defalcations; yet it is but right to
ay that nothing has occurred in the practical
operation of the system to weaken
in the slightest degree, but much to
strengthen, the confident anticipations of i
its friends. The grounds of these have
been heretofore so fully explained as to <
require no recapitulation. In respect to i
the facility and convenience it affords in <
conducting the public service, and the <
ability of the Government to discharge <
through its agency every duty attendant
on the collection, transfer, and disburs- '
mentof the public money with prompti- ?
tude and success, I can say with confi- <
denee, that the apprehensions of those j
who felt it to be their duty to oppose its j
adoption have proved to be unfounded.? I
On the contrary, this branch of the fiscal <
affairs of the Government has been, and i
it is believed may always be, thus carried j
on with every desirable facility and secu- |
xily. A few changes and improvements in I
the details of the system, without affec- j
ting any principles involved in it, will be I
submitted to you by the Secretary of the
Treasury, and will, I am sure, receive at '
your hands that attention to which they (
may, on examination, be found to been* <
tilled. <
I have deemed this brief summary of the t
fiscal affairs necessary to the due perfor- 1
ivranee of a duty especially enjoined on '
me by theconatituiion. It will serve, also, <
to illustrate more fully the principles by 1
which I hare been guided in reference to i
??rn rnnteated nnints in our DubllC Dolicv, t
which were earliest in their development, '
and have been more important in their 1
consequences, than any that have arisen 1
under our complicated and dificult, yet t
admirable, system of government: I allude
to a national debt, and a national
bank. It wss in these that the political t
contest by which the country has been c
* ever since the adoption of the constitution. *
in a great measure, originated; and there 8
Is too much reason to apprehend that the 1
conflicting interests and opposing princi- 0
tries thus marshalled, will continue, as 8
heretofore, to produae similar, if not *i
aggravated, consequences: 1
Coming into office the declared ene- 1
toy of both, I have earnestly endeavored r
to prevent a reaort to either. r
The consideration that a large public

Some degree, a necessity also, for resor- tl
ting to a system and extent of taxation 8
which is n.ot only oppressive throughout, e
but likewise so apt to lead, in the end, to *
the commission of that moat odious of all *'
offences against the principles of rcpublj- *
can government?the prostitution of poli- ?
lical power, conferred for the general P
benefit, to the aggrandizement of particu- 'J
lar classes, and the gratification of indi- "
Tidual cupidity?is alone sufficient, inde- e
pendently of the weighty objecliona a
which have already been urged, to ren- p1
tier its creation and existence the sources
of bitter and unappeasable discord. If ?

refer to the example of every Government ^
which has existed, for proof how seldom a
it is that the system, when once adopted 0
and implanted in the policy of a country, *
has failed to expand itself, until public c
credit was exhausted, and the people were d
no longer able to endure its increasing t
weight, seems impossible to resist the *
conclusion, that no benefits resulting G

accession of wealth to partirujRr classes, c
nor any, nor an us combined advantages, c
csn counterbalance its ultimate but certain 8
results?a splendid Government, and im- 1
opverished people. f
If a national bank was, as is nndenia- [
ble, repudiated by the framers of the con* i
slitulion as incompatible with the rights of (
the states und tlic^liberlies of the people; *
if, from the beginning.it has been regard- ?
ml by a large portion of our citizens as 8
coming in direct collision with that great I
end vital amendment of the constitution ?
which declares tfyrt all powers not conferred
by that instrument on the general
government are reserved to the states and
to the people; if as it has been viewed by
them as the first great step in the march
of iatitudinous construction, which, if unchecked,
would ronder that sscred instrument
of as little value as an unwritten
constitution, dependent, as it alone, would
be, for its meaning, on the interested interpretation
of a dominant party, and affording
no secuiity to the rights of the minority;?if
stich is undeniably the case,
what rational grounds could have been con
ceivedfor anticipating aught but determined
opposition to such an institution at the
present day?
Could a different result have been expected,
when the consequences which
have flowed from its creation, and particularly
from its struggles to perpetuate its
existence, had confirmed, in so striking a
manner, the apprehensions of its earliest
opponents; when it had been so clearly
demonstrated {that a concentrated moneypower,
wielding so vast a capital, and
combining such incalculable means of influence,
may, in those peculiar conjunctures
to whieh this government is nnavoi
dably exposed, prove an overmatch for the
political power of the people themselves;
when the true character of its capacity to
regulate, according to its will and its into*
rests, and the interests of its favorites, the
value and production of the labor and property
of every man in this extended country,
had been so fully and fearfully developed;
when it was notorious that all classes
of this great community had, by means
of the power and influence it thus possesses,
been infected to madness with a spirit
of heedless speculation; when it had been
seen that, secure in the support of the
combination of influences by which it was
surrounded, it could vioiate its charter,
and set the laws at deflance with impunity;
and when, too, it had become most apparent
that to believe such an accumulation
of powers can he granted without the certninfv

i fatal delusion?
To avoid the necessity of a permanent
debt, and its inevitable consequences, I
idvoeated, and endeavored to carry into
sffect, the policy of confining the appro,
priations for the public service to such objects
only as are clearly within the constitutional
authority of the federal govern-'
ment; of excluding from its expenses those {
improvident and unauthorized grants of
public money for works of internal im- j
provcraent, which were so wisely arrested j
by the constitutional; interposition of my
predecessor, and which, if they had not
been so checked, would long before this
;ime have involved the finances of the ge> j
leral government in embarrassments far j
greater than those which are now experi-1
;nced by any of the states; of limiting all;
>ur expenditures to that simple, unosten-j
atious. and economical administration of:
>ublic affairs, which is alone consistent]
with the character of our inatutions; of
collecting annually from the customs and
he sales of the public lands, a revenue
ully adequate to defray all the expenses
hus incurred, but, under no pretence
arhatsoever, to impose taxes upon thepeo>leto
a greater amount than was actually
lecessary to the public service, conducted
ipon the principles I have stated.
In lieu of a national bank, or a depenlenceupon
banks of any description, for
he management of our fiscal affairs, I re*
lommend the adoption of the system
vhich is now in successful operation. This
ystem affords every requisite facility for
he transaction of the pecuniary concerns
if fhe government; will, it is confidently
nticipated, produce in other respects maty
benefits which have been from time to
ime expected from the creation of a na>
ional bank, but which hare never been 1
ealized; avoid the manifold evils insepa* !
able from such an institution; diminish, 1
o a greater extent than eould be accom? '
dished by any other measure of reform, (
he patronage of the federal government? 1
wise policy in all governments, but more 1
specially so in one like ours, which works 1
veil only proportion as it is made to rely j
or its support upon the unbiassed and un* 1
dulteraicd opinions of its constituents? 1
o away, forever, all dependence on cor* '
orate bodies, either in the raising, col* t
ecting, safekeeping or disbursing the pub*
ic revenues; and place the government 1
qually above the temptation of fostering
dangerous and unconstitutional instituion
at home, or the necessity of adapting
is policy to the views and interests of a
till more formidable money powerabroad.
It is by adopting and carrying out these
rinciples. under circumstances the most
rduous and discouraging, that the attempt
ias been made, thus far successfully, to
iemonstrate to the people of the United ;
Itatea that a national bank at all times, 1
nd a national debt, except it be incurred
it a period when the honor and safety of '
he nation demand a temporary sacrifice 1
>f a policy which should only be aban>
toned in such exigencies, are not merely
innecessary, but in direct and deadly hos*
ility to the principles of their government, 1
md to their own permanent welfare. i
The progress made in the development
>i three positions, appears in the prece*
ling sketch of the past history and present 1
into of the financial concerns of the fede> '
ol government. The facts there stated
ully authorize the assertion, that all the
xirposes for which this government was
netituted have been accomplished during
our years of greater pecuniary embarrassnent
than were ever before experienced
n time of peace, and in the face of oppo- 1
iition as formidable aB any that was ever
tefore arrayed against the policy of au ;
tdmiiustration, that this has beejj done

ment were decreasing, as well from the
operation of the lava, aa the condition of
the country, withoot the creation of a per*
raanent public debt, or incurring any liability,
other than aueh as the ordinary resources
of the government will speedily
discharge, and without the agency of a
national bank.
If this view of the proceedings of the government,
for the lime itembraces, be warranted
by facts as they are known to exist,
ifthejarmy it navy have been sustained to
the extent authorized by law, and which
Congress deemed sufficient for the defence
of the country and the protection of it?
rights and its honor: if its civil and diplomatic
service bas^been equally sustained;
if ample provision hss been made for the
administration of justice and the execution
of the lavs; if the claims upon public
gratitude in behalf of thi soldiers of the
Revolution, have been promptly met,
and faithfully discharged;^if there have
been no failures in defraying the very
large expenditures rgrowing out of the
long continued and salutary policy of
peacefully removing the^Indians .to regions
of comparative safety and prospeFity;
if the public faith has at all limes, and
every where, been most scrupulously
maintained by a prompt discharge of the
numerous, extended and diversified claims
on the Treasury;?if all these great and
permanent objects, with many others that
might be stated, have for a series of yeurs,
marked by peculiar obstacles and difficulties,
been successfully accomplished.without
a resort to a permanent debt, or the
aid of a national banks have we not a
right to expect that a policy, the object of
which has been to sustain the public service
independently of either of these fruitful
sources of discord, will receive the final
sanction of a people whose unbiassed
and fairly elicited judgment upon public
affairs is never ultimately wrong?
That them embarrassments in the pecuniary
concerns of individuals, of unexampled
extent and duration, have recently
existed in this as in other commercial nations,
is undoubtedly true. To suppose
it necessary now to trace these reverses
to their sources, would be a reflection on
the intelligence of my fellow citizens.?
Whatever might have been the obscurity
in which the subject was involved during
the earlier stages of the revulsion, there
cannot now be many by whom the whole
question is not fully understood.
Not deeming it within the constitutional
powers of the general government to
repair private losses sustained by reverses
in business having no connexion with the
public service, either by dire'et appropiiafiona

designed to secure exclusive privileges
and immunities to individuals or
classes in preference to, and at the expense
of, the great majority necessarily
debarred from any participation in them,
no attempt to do so has been either made,
recommended, or encouraged by the present
Executive.
It is believed, however, thit the great
purposes for the attainment of which the
federal government was instituted have not
been lost sight of. Intrusted only with
limited powers, cautiously enumerated,
distinctly specified, and defined with a
precision and clearness which would seem
to defy misconstruction, it has been my
constant aim to confine myself within the
limits so clearly marhed out, and so carefully
guarded. Having always been of
opinion that the best preservative of the
the union of the States is to be found in
the total abstinence from the exercise of
all doubtful powers on the part of the
federal government rather than in attempts ;
to assume them by a loose construction of
the constitution! or an ingenious perversion
of its words, I hare endeavored to
avoid recommeding any measure which I
had reason to apprehend would, in the
opinion even of -a considerable minority
of my fellow citizens, be regarded as
trenching on the rights of the States, or
the provisions of the hallowed instrument
of our Union. Viewing the aggregate
powers of the federal government as a voluntary
concession of the States, it seemBd
to me that such only should be exercised
as were at the time intended to be
given.
I have been strengthened, too, in the
propriety of this course, by the conviction
that all* efforts to go beyond this, tend
only to produce dissatisfaction and distrust,
to excite jealousises, and to provoke resistance.
Instead of adding strength to
the federal gevernment, even when successful,
they rau&t ever prove a source of
incurable weakness, by alienating a portion
of those whose adhesion is indispensable
to the great aggregate of united
strength, and whose voluntary attachment
is, in my estimation, far more essential
to the efficiency of a government strong
in the beat of all possible strength?the
confidence and attachment of all those
who make up its constituent elements.
Thus believing, it has been my purpose
to secure to the whole people, and to
every member of the confederacy, by
general, salutary, and equal laws alone,
the bendfit of those republican institutions
which it was the end tfnd aim of the constitution
to establish, and the impartial
influence of which is, in my judgment,
indispensable to their preservation; 1
cannot bring myself to believe that the
lasting happiness of the people, the prosperity
of the States, or the permanency
of their Union, can be maintained by giving
preference or priorty to any class of
citizens in the distribution of benefits or
privileges, or by the adoption of measures
which enrich one portion ef the
Upton at the expense of another ttor can

Government with the local legislation and
reserved rights of the States a remedy fori1
present, or a security against future dangers.
The first, and assuredly not the least, i
important step towards relieving the country
from the condition into which it had
been plunged by excess in trade, banking,
and credits of all kinds, was to place
the business transactions of the Government
itself on a solid basis; giving aud rei
ceiving in all cases value for value, and
i neither countenancing nor encouraging in
i others that delusive system of credits
i from which it has been found so difficult
. to escape, and which has left nothing be;
hind it but wrecks that mark its fatal cai
reer.
That the financial affairs of the Govern:
ment are now, and have been during the
i whole period of these widespreading dif,
faculties, conducted wiih 4 strict and invariable
regard to this great fundamental
principle, and that by ihe assumption and
maintenance of the stand thus taken on
" the very threshold of the approaching crisis,
more than by any other cause or cau,
ses whatever, the community at large has
been shielded from the incalculable evils
of a general and indefinite suspention of
i specie payments, and a consequent annii
hilation, for the whole period it might
: have lasted, of a just and invariable stan,
dard of value, will, it is believed, at this
period, scarcely be questioned.
A steady adherence, on the part of the
government to the policy which has
produced such salutary results aided by
judicious State legislation, and, what is
' not less important, by the industry, enterprise,
perseverance and econmy of the
American people, cannot fail to raise the
whole country, at an early period, to a
state of solid and enduring prosperity not
to be again overthrown by the suspension of
banks or the explosion of a bloated credit
system. Ii is for the people, and not their
representatives, to decide whether or not
the permanent welfare of the country
(which all good citizens equally desire,
how widely they may differ as to the means
of its accomplishment) shall be in this way
secured, or whether the management ofthe
pecuniary concerns of the government,
and by consequence, to a great extent,
those of .individuals also, shall be
carried back to a condition of things which
fostered those contractions and expansions
! of the currency, and those reckless abuses
i of credit, from the baleful effects of which
the country has so deeply suffered?a return
that can promise, in the end, no belter
results than to reproduce the embarrassments
the government has experien!
ced, and to remove from the shoulders of
j the present, to those of fresh victims, the
J bitter fruits of that spirit of the speculative
enterprise to which our countrymen
are so liable, and upon which the lessons
of experience are so unavailing. The
choice is an imoortant one, and I sincerely
hope that it may be wisely made.
A report from the Secretary of War,
presenting a detailed view of the affaire
of that department, accompanies this
communication.
The desultory duties connected with
the removal of the Indians, in which the
army has been constantly engaged on the
northern and western frontiers, and in
I Florida, have rendered it impracticable
io carry into iuii eDect (lie pJan recommended
by the Secretary for improving
its discipline. In every instance where 1
the regiments have been concentrated,
they hare made great progress; and the j
best results may be anticipated from a
continuance of this system. During the 1
last season, a part of the troops have '
been employed in removing Indians from !
the interior to the territory assigned them J
in the west?a duty which they hare per- '
formed efficiently, and with praiseworthy '
humanity; and that portion of them which !
has been stationed in Florida continued 1
active operations there throughout the
heats of summer. r
The policy of the United States in re- *
gard to the Indians, of which a succinct "
account is given in my message of 183S, c
and of the wisdom and expediency of c
which I am fully satisfied, his been con- '
tinued in active operation throughout the
whole period of my administration.? *
Since the spring of 1837, more than for- *
ty thousand Indians have been removed ?
to their new homes west of the Mississip- '
pi; and I am happy to add, that all ac- *
counts concur in representing the result c
of this measure as eminently beneficial to
that people. J
The emigration of the Seminoles alone 1
has been attended with serious difficulty, *
and occasioned bloodshed; hostilities hav- *
ing been commenced by tne Indians in c
Florida, under the apprehension that tbey ?
would be compelled, by force, to com- *
ply with their treaty stipulations. Thr ?
execution of the treaty of Payne's Landing,
signed in 1832, but not ratified until e
1634, was postponed, at the solicitation *
of the Indians, until 1636, when they ?
again renewed their agreement to remove 11
peaceably to their new homes in the west. ?
In the face of. this solemn and renewed j1
compact, they broke their faith, and com- "
menced hostilities by the massacre of Major
Dade's command, the murder of their "
agent, General Thompson, and other *
acts of cruel treachery. When this "
alarming and unexpected intelligence
reached the seat of Government, every
effort appears to have been made to reinforce
General Clinch, who cdmmanded v
the troops then in Florida. General Eu9tis
was despatched with reinforcements
f /ll 1__a a nul I'
irurn \^iiarjc&iuji; iruups were coucw wm?.
from AJabama, Tennessee, and Georgia; Ma
General Scott tos $ent to UK* tbe com- fc
mend, vyirtt aqjplp junf&s and ampin
means. At tbe first alarm, General Gaines
organized a force at New Orleans, and,
without waiting for orders, landed in
Florida, where fie deliveredjover the troops
he had brought with' him to Geuerai "
Scott. *
Governor Call was subsequently appointed
to conduct a summer campaign;
and. at the olosa of it, was' replaced *7^'General
Jesup. These events and changes
took place under the administration
of my predecessor. Notwithstanding the
exertions of the experienced officers who
had command there for eighteen months,. .
on entering upon the administration- of
the Government I found the Territorytof
Florida a prey to Indian atrocities. A strenuous
effort was immediately made to**'
bring these hostilities to a close; and fb*
army, under General Jesup, was rein-'
forced until it amounted to ten thousand
men, and furnished with abundant sup-'
plies of every description. In this campaign
a great number of the enemy were
cantured and destroyed: but the character
I "? / ? ,
of the contest only was changed. ,' The
Indians, having been defeated in every >
engagement, dispersed in small bands
throughout tho country, and became an
enterprising, formidable, and ruthless banditti.
General Taylor, who succeeded
General Jesup, used his best exertions to
subdue them; and was seconded in his efforts
by the officers under his command;
but he, too, failed to protect the Territory
fro? their depredations. By an act of
signal and cruel treachery, they broke
the truce made with them by Genersl
Macomb, who was sent from Washington
for the purpose of carrying into effect the
expressed wishes of Congress, end hare
continued their devastations, ever since.?
General Armistead, who was in Florida
when General Taylor left the army, by
permission, assumed the command, and,
after active summer operations, was met
by propositions for peace; and, from the
fortunate coincidence of the arrival in
Florida, ft the same peried, of a delegation
from the Semiooles who are happily
eettled west of Ifie Mississippi, and are
now anxious to persuade their countrymen
to join them there, hopes Were for some 4
time entertained that the Indians might
be induced to leave the Territory without
further difficulty. These hopes have proved
fallacious, and hostilities have been
renewed throughout'tbe whole of the Ter- .
ritory That this contest has endured so
long, is to he attributed to causes beyond
the control of the Gsvernmont. Exprperienced
generals have had the command
of the troops; officers and soldiers have
alike distinguished themselves for their
activity, patience, and enduring coorage;
the army has been constantly furnished
with supplies of every description; and
we must look for the causes which have
so long procrastinated the issue of the
contest, in the vast extent of the ibvatre
of hostilities, the almost insurmountable
nh<;tArIf>4 nrp?Mil?il Kir nature of the
country, the climate* and the wily char*
acter of the savages.
The sites for marine hospitals on the rivers
and lakes, which [ was authorized to
select and cause to be purchased, have all *
been designated; but, the appropriation
not proving nufficient, conditional arrange*
ments only have been made for their acquisition.
It is for Congress to deeide
whether those conditional purchases shall
be sanctioned, and the humane intention*
of the law carried into full effect..
The Davy, as will appear from the ac* *
companding report of the Secretary, has
been usefully and honorably employed in
the protection of our commerce and cili* '
sens in the Mediterranean, the Pacific,
[>n the coast of Brazil, and in the Golf of
Mexico. A small squadron, consisting
)f the frigate Constellation and thealoop*
if-war Boston, under Commodore Rear*
jey, is now on its way to tha China and
Indian seas, for lbs purpose of attending
