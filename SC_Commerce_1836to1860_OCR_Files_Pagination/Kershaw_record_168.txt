of Bolt Court Society Surgeon to the Royal

This valuable medicine, the result of twentv
years' experience and unparralleled success in the
extensive and highly respectable practice of the
proprietor, patronised by the faculty and nobility,
is now introduced to the notice ol the American
public, at the earnest solicitation of a numkr ot
gentlemen of long end high standing in the pro'ession.
It is hoped, as a preliminary step, to
oheck the evils and fatal consequences, arising
from the use of the numerous deleterious hostrum.foisted
upon the public by the aid of fabricated
proofs of miraculous cures, and other frauds, by a
set of mercenary, unprincidled pretenders, so totally
ignorant ot medical science that it is impossible
the monstrous delusion can any longer g<>
down with the intelligent people of this country.
These pills, mild ana agreeable in their nature,
should be kept in every family in cases of sudden
illness, for by their prompt administration, chole
ra, cramps, spasms, fevers, and olhpr alarming
complaints, which too oflen .prove fatal, may be
speedily cured or prevented, lu fact, all those
who value good health shonld never be without
thein. They are sold in packets, at 50 cents, $1.

PATENT COI iOll ?I1?.
Hlfci Gin can be made double, or single. If
made double, they reduce labor,~ and gin just
double, the quantity ot cottuii over the single cylinder
Gin, no other knd having been in use prevous
to this pateutj and whether single or double, the)
are found to Httprove the quality of the cotton, by
more pertectly cleaning it. Tliey can be made to
contain trom 20 to 100 saws in a stand, and whether
small or large, one hand will be sufficient to attend
them. The Gins have mechanical feeders and
hoppers attached to them, which free the cotton
trom leaves, trash, dirt, &c. before it can reach the
saws, and by the thorough hackling operation it
receives irom me reetlers, which make two revolutions
to one of the saws, it is almost in a half
gined state, before it descends to the saw By a
very simple arrangement of a screw to each set of
gaa'tes, on which the hoppers rest, and through
which the teeth of the feeders pass, they can be
made to teed slow or fast - to suit the condition of
the cotton at the time When made double, the
saws are placed on two eels ol cylinders and turn
upon each other in opposite directions, and are
cleansed by two spts ot brushes that have four revo
lutions to one of. twe saw. The two cylinders can
be detached so as to enable the planter to run one
or both at pleasure, although embraced with feeders.
&c. in one stand. The whole is put in operation
with a drum and band, as in the ordinary Gin, and
may be propelled by horse, steam , or water power
It may also be propelled by iron running gear.
The force required to work it, is about the same as
that necessary to move an eaual number of saws in
the common Gin. This Gin has been put in
operation in New Orleans for two or three weeks,
and its success tested - in the presence of a large
number of planters, merchants and others, and
received their general approbation
Several genilenm n have been so kind as to give
the Patentee their written opinion respecting the
merits of the Gin. A number of others could be
added, but the following are deemed sufficient:

anil was very muck pleated with its perlorn.nnce
The mere fact of its self-feeding, teems to me to
be a very valuable improvement; and besides, ibe
quality of the cotton, at* it comes out of the process,
appeared to me to be better and ele.iner than
from the common Gins in use, and that it saves
considerably in tabor. Respectfully. A c

?_?i n jiint-i^-urur oir, in reply lo your note,
accompanied by a specimen of the cotton, ginned
by your Patent Gin, 1 beg leave to observe, that it
exhibits a decid. d-improvement on the usual process
of ginning: delivering the staple uninjured
and free from nap or trash, clean and of good co?.
lor; thereby giving the article an additional value.
These favoiable impressions of the advantages of
your Patent Gin, have bet n confirmed by subsequently
witnessing it in operation. The utility of
the double cylinders and saving of labor, will bo
readily perceived and properly appreciated by the
intelligent planter.
i eelmg a deep interest in the success of all improvements
tending to benefit the important staples
of our countly, 1 trust that yours will meet with
the encourageoit nt it justly merits.
Very respectfully, your ob t aerv't,

Dr. A Jo es?Dear ?ir,answer tc your inquiry
of my opinion id your Patent Cotton Gin, I
beg leave to state, that 1 ?us fifteen years engafred
in the cotton factories of Manchester, Engand.
and during tour years of that time, 1 was
foreman in the house ot Messrs. Lewis, Williams
?V Co., and near five years spinner in the hlNMe ?f
Messrs. JSandtoru & "Gr-cm . .1 have mtW- your
Cotton Gir> in operation, and have examinee the
cntton ginned by ii, and pronounce it belter cleansed,
and the staple Icrh injured, than any cotton
that ever came under my obscuration. It is completely
rea?.y for the breaker without the aid of the
blower, and would, therefore, save the first process
in manufacturing the article 1 consider ccltcn
cleansed by your Gin, would con n-ond from one
to two cents on the pound n ore than the average
ctops brought into the Manchester market, and
cleansed by common Gins Vours, very icsp'lv.
