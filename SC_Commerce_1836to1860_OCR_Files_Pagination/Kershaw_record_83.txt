IIAVRK, April 5. '
Our Cotton market was fu:n yesterday, and the1 i
avanee from the lowest point muv he considered at 1
full 10 centimes. Upon some purchases it is more,
but on an average, two sols is about the nhsrdute
rise. Still, even with ibis our prices are very low,
in comparison with prices in the United Stales, and
the losses are necessarily tremendous.
APRIL 7 ?Purchases of some importance, have
been made, partly by the trade, partly by speculators,
during the last eight days, with a gradual improve.ivit
in prices. Upon the whole, however,
our rates, for United States, short staple are only
2 1-2 centimes higher than they wore on tin- 2'lth
ult. tin* day which prec< ded :lic* heavy lall heretofore
noticed. The sales are 8200 bags and no arrivals.

he lost his equilibrium, fell into the river,;

who had been three limes ma ricd. The unfortunate
speculator in matrimony had
married his first wife, a very worldly,
avaricious woman, who grasped at every
thing, and never was satisfied. The second
was a corpulent, easy, dirty quiet
soul, always in good humor, and satisfied
with every thing ; lite last was a most violent
termagant, who rendered his life
miserable while she lived. The good ?dd
man, upon reviewing his past life, used to
observe, ? My friends, 1 have had variety

may literally say, I have married the

Why then, says A. I'll tell you, and my

was the primitive language, and the foundation
of all the languages in the world.
The two brothers, you know quarreled in

THE PRESENT CKlntS.
The past week, so far irum showing any
improvement in the general condition of
affairs, has been, on the whole, more disastrous
in its results than any which had preceded
it A large number of failures occurred,
probably more than fifty, ^including
many of our largest and best h >tisos. It is
melancholy to look upon the wreck of for- j
tunes realized by a long course of business; '
to sec firms which a year ago were worth a 1
half a milli >11, or upwards, prostrated as,

?r?>s< nt deranged state of 'lie currency, j
jould secure them against disas er. Hut to (
nake the best ol" it, a failure, to such li >u?es
s an immense calamity, and one which it
may take years of prosperous business to
repair. Then then is tne deep tnor ilie.jion
which a man of honor feels, on (in ing '
limself unable to meet his engagements,

have caused the ruin of others. There
