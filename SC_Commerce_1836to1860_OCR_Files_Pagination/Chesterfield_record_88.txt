Another Experiment !?If the Globe '
is justly regarded as the exponent of the
views of the Executive, another "Experiment1'
is about to be made upon "the lifeblood
of the American People." Thej
monstrous anomaly of a Treasury Bank!
is to he attempted to tlood thn nation with
Government tissigiiats, as a substitute for j
Bank credits and notes. The following
extracts from the Globe of Thursday night
bear this construction, and no other :

or a draft on the collector, or some other ofli- j
cer in whose hands the collections of public
money at New York might be placed Alight:
not such drafts vpo:i the great points of col tec-;
tion, receivable a' the same time at the land nfji-; '
ccs, afford greater conveniences, both to the I
public creditors and to those who wished to j1
purchase lands or pay duties, than any private <
corposation ? Upon the showing of this pro. j <
jeeter, it seems perfectly useless to employ:
aay such agency. The Trcrsury of tie Un'i-j (
ted Sla^s, with a ftW suitable and responsible!
public officers at the great emporiums of com. j1
icercial intercourse, is amply hnjficient to carry '
"/i the transactions required by the public servir , j'
without placing the public finances under the 11
control of any grasping corporation. The i 1
Public have seen and experienced quite i
enough of their boasted facilities ,
44 Such an arrangement will operate as the 1
most salutary c'lck upon the inflations of pa. j j

j we learn that an intimation has been given to j A

so J board. Had they not better count the ducks j:
e. I and turkeys in the fowl house, and make the ?
pr cook uncover the pots in the caboose to know ^
what is for dinner. It is hard enough to swal- q
low some laws, and harder yet to digest ilie- q

? TO THE PUBLIC. O
,0 The undersigned has made arrangemen's, i O
uj and, as he supposed, surrendered all active !
, agency with the press , which arrangements j
have, for a time, at least, been suspended.
Il* In resuming his duties as an editor, and ten- i p
'St dering his services te the mercantile commu- j p'
m nity, lie would say that, while the official or-, jj
nt | gan at the seat of Government receives large j
er j annual stipends as the reward of political!
Cm! prostitution, the merchants as a class, dis-' Si

0f i ed the political press, and by giving their pat- Si
j ronage to neutrals, oiFered a premium for'ser- 1
^ j vility. Recent events have demonstrated the j
n sensitive religion between the agriculture of j T
ns j the Soatii and West, and the commerce and j *
| manufactures of the East; and it becomes j
^ | the merchants to deliberate how they can j ^
i best counteract the conspiracy which would j
0f j array an unnatural warfare between sections j
an ! and interests so closely identified. j bi
a ! As good citizens, they have no remedy but ! [ie
j the ballot box; an enlightened public opinion |
ajj 1 constitutes the only medium through which I
'^Q they can vindicate their motives or protect j
|t0 1 their interests, in a government like ours, j
the press is the great lever of public sentiment. tc
|ie The necessity of unity in support of a common j n]
ed or?an' ably representing their objects and j w
a ! principles, was the subject of anxious solici-, |1;
VQ ' tude; and after a full comparison of opinions, J tc
I tlie basis of concevt was embodied in the pro- j
,u. j spectus of the Reformer, and Mr. Ck.vllc, a i
|Uj j gentleman of experience and distinguished J
^ ; ability, selected as the Editor, under the pat-; ~
j ronage of those members of Congress from ;
| the South and West, who are opposed to the | T
j e isiing Administration. | J
n-j It is believed that their present Litter ex- 0]
of j pericnee will induce the merchants of the m-! 0:
terior, as well as of the sea-board, to unite ! T
on with these distmguised statesmen. The nier-! c<
r" chants, who must now feel the want of such ; lc
al a press, can extend its circulation and secure j ki
r? for it a patronage which will enable the pub-1 'e

as Mr. Cr.vlle will reside in Washington,'tc
from whence lie can communicate three times |
cn , a day with the publisher, who will reside in | J
rt- i Baltimore, and do all he can to make "The j
j Merchant" equal to any other press for j 0
at usefulness, intelligence, and public virtue. j a:
Among tlie arrangements in contemplation ; p
i5- i is the employment of an able associate Ed- j
j itor to reside in New York, who, being well i
I informed in mercantile affairs, will unite his j ed
! talents and experience in enriching our coln
j umns. We have assurances from some of *
n- | the most eminent merchants that they will
of ' aid us in the selection; and to such a corre-1 c
on | spondent, the most liberal compensation which 1 o
rn j the resources of the paper justilics, will be j tl
cs given. I a
The Merchant will be a daily paper at ?3 j t:

nt j printed in Baltimore, will bear date at Wash- i *l
c- j ington, and the same attention will be paid to I *
of j the proceedings of Congress and the political j ?
y. J department, as if it were printed in Washing-j 0
re j ton. In fact, the facility cf communication j ?
nv j and the arrangement of the mail are such as !
its | give this point gre; advantage. j t!
It will be seen that the plan p; eposes a liea- 1
i vv expenditure. We call upon the merchants i
