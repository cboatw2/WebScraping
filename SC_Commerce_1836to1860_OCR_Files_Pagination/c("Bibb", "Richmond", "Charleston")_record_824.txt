A Methodist Monthly Periodical.-;—The
reader will find on our fourth page, a suggestion in
favour of establishing a new publication under the
patronage of the Methodist E. Church. Were the
cut bono of this case more apparent, it would still
be exceedingly questionable whether an extensive
and sustained circulation could be obtained for the
proposed monthly. The success of the Methodist
Quarterly Review, able and deserving as that pub
lication is, confessedly, would not warrant very
sanguine expectations.

THE SUPPORT OP THE MINISTRY. No. 2.
We have heard the voice of Scripture ; let us
hear what the Discipline of our Church says upon
this subject.
The annual allowance of the travelling, super
numerary and superannuated preachers and Bish
ops, who are married, is two hundred dollars and
their travelling expenses. If unmarried, it is one
hundred dollars and their travelling expenses.—
There.is also an annual allowance to each child of
sixteen dollars if under seven, and of twenty-four
t dollars, if from seven to fourteen years of age.—
Dis. Part II. Sec. 4. A house is to be provided
either by building or renting; and fuel and table
expenses are to be supplied to the preachers and
their families. Discip. 175-177.
There is a false impression sometimes made upon
our congregations when public collections for the 1
support of the circuit or station are taken up, by
representing that the amount of quarterage, as the
above-named allowances are called, is all to which
the preachers have a claim, whereas the Discipline
calls for a decent support for preachers and their
families. This imperfect statement is designed to
awaken the sympathies of the people, but its effect
is to diminish their contributions, for each man
thinks, that where the claim is so small, the ne
cessary amount may be easily obtained, and there
fore pays less, both at the public collection and in
making quarterly payments, than he would proba
bly, were the full disciplinary allowance stated.—
This suppressw veri is wrong in itself, and leads
to evil consequences. The ministry want that
which the people would gladly supply, if they knew
their whole duty in the premises. If the people
would do all that the discipline requires towards
Dupjjuumg mu pcauuuic) mu iiiuoi ui uiurn, uy
proper economy, could, with their allowance, their
perquisites, their presents and their own private
resources, when they have any, live comfortably,
and afford their children a respectable education.
As it is, however, they and their families often
suffer for want of the comforts, if not the necessa
saries of life ; their children grow up in ignorance
and poverty, or their own property is wholly con
sumed in supplying what it is the duty of the
Church to furnish.
But the Discipline even mentions a plan, by
which these supplies are to be obtained. It makes
it the class-leader’s duty (p. 79,) “to receive week
ly what the members of his class are willing to
give toward the relief of the preachers and the
Church.” It says, at page 170, “ The more ef
fectually to ra'se the amount necessary to meet
the above-mentioned allowances, (quarterage,) let
there be made weekly class-collections in all our
societies, where it is practicable.”
It makes it the duty of the preachers to aid in
raising these supplies. Those having charge of
circuits are to overlook the accounts of all the
Stewards, and to see that public collections be
made quarterly, if need be. See Dis. page 44.—
Again it requires at p. 174, that “ in no case shall
an allowance (from the Conference funds) be made
to any travelling preacher who has travelled in a
circuit, where he might, in the judgment of the
Annual Conference, have obtained his full quar
terage, if he had applied for it.”
Here the duty of our preachers to make effort
to obtain their support from the people,—and that
too, upon a definite plan, is recognized. I believe,
that, upon this subject, a false and improper delica
cy pervades our ranks. If a man be justly in
debted to us, we can ask payment of the debt.—
The people are' in debt to the preacher, until he is
supported. Shall we not require that the debt be
paid, so that they may owe no man any thing save
love 1 Wo are to teach the people their duty.—
God sends us forth, for this purpose. It is their
duty, by Divine appointment, to support the gos
pel, and shall we permit them to neglect it, to of
fend God, and to jeopard their own souls, by for
bearing to enjoin this duty, lest they look upon us
as interested mortals 1 And indeed we are inter
ested : for. UDon the fulfilment of their obligation
in this respect, depends the temporal comfort of
our wives and children, and God requires us by a
fixed law of our nature, to feel a deep and perma
nent interest in their well-being. Independent of
this, however, we are not to select subjects of in
struction, in view of making our lessons agreea
ble to our hearers. This course would banish
from the pulpit all severe and indignant reproof of
sin, and exclude from reprimand all those follies
and vices, which fashion, in the judgmentof many,
renders necessary, or which a loose public opinion
sanctions. We must discharge our duty to our
selves, our families, the world, the Church, and
God, by teaching everywhere, let the issue be what
it may, the necessity and obligation of increased
liberality toward every holy enterprise. Besides,
our lessons may not so much affect the supplies
received by ourselves during our short stay in one
work, as open the fountains of liberality, so that
these shall flow more and more freely from\ear to
year ever afterwards. Thus, our teachings may
result in lasting good to our successors, the Church
and the souls of men. Can we be guiltless then,
if we hold our peace upon these subjects 1 We
cannot, I verily believe.
But there is another voice to be heard,—the
voice of the people,—more potent for effect, than
all others. The voice of the people ! alas ! here
many voices may be heard,—most of them speak
ing strange words, a tongue unknown to him, edu.
cated in the school of Christ. All unite perhaps
in saying that the preacher should be paid, but
many pretend, it may be justly, that they are not
able to contribute. Some say, that they can give
so little, that their mite is not worth receiving.
Others, though indulging in many extravagant ex
penditures, say, that their home-expenses are so
great, they can spare nothing for extraneous ob
j ects. Others, who hoard their gains, and deny
themseles every comfort and refinement, cay that
the preachers and their families should live just as
they and their families live,—forgetting that it
seldom happens, even under the most favorable
circumstances, that a preacher can live as comfor
tably as his talent and industry would enable him
to do, if engaged in some secular employment, and
that he and his family are justly entitled to ap
proximate, at least, to that manner of living to
which they have been accustomed, or which he
could provide for them in some other vocation.
Others there are, who acknowledge the right of
their minister to a support, and take it for granted
that it is afforded, without troubling themselves so
far as to ask if it be so, or seeking to know whether
they have given all that they could or should give
toward securing for him proper compensation.
There are some, however, who say that this binding
debt of obligation shall be discharged, by as much
as they can accomplish it, and they will live on a
crust and a cup of cold water, rather than drive
the gospel from their doors, by refusing an adequate
support to its heralds. But these are few,—alas
how few!
The issue is, that somo give only, when they
can do so without diminishing their own luxurious
living;—that some compute their meagre gifts as
large, having proportioned them to their stinted
bounty to their own families ;—that some give, if
the preacher be a favorite, thus making their duty
to vary with their prejudices ;—that others, from
their hoarded treasures, unwillingly dole out a
pitiful mite, just enough to permit them to assert
without lying against conscience, that they have
given, while their parsimonious spirit begrudges
the niggardly benefaction; that many give no
thing ; and that others, doubtless the majority, give
next to nothing, which may be counted as nothing,
compared with what their duty, their ability and
their indebtedness to the gospel demand ; while a
precious few, with baptized hearts, deny themselves,
to be able to give liberally to this heaven-directed
purpose.
That I have not misrepresented either the prin
ciple of the practice of the people, let the poverty
and want of the ministry, the ignorance to which
their children are often doomed, and the destitu
tion of the families of the superannuated and dead
preachers testify. I call to witness to these truths
the many able and useful men, whose necessities
have driven them to location, and the many in the
ministry, whose labours are so circumscribed, by
their being compelled to give partial attention to
some secular employment, by which to provide for
their families, that they can only itinerate within
a certain well defined circle ; and I call to witness
the many valuable men, who, though called to the
ministry, have fled from duty, frightened from their
allotted task, by the inadequate support of those
already in the work, and have turned to the world’s
better re warded pursuits, that they might live as
others. This is wrong, I grant, but they are actu
ated by the same principle,—a desire that they and
their families should never want, which lies at the
root of this,—this crime against which I write ; a
those, who, in proportion to their ability, give most
sparingly, and of which, when discovered to actu
ate a minister, they, of all men, most bitterly com
plain. I call to witness against the church, the
shameful annual deficiency of at least one fourth
of the small allowance of quarterage, and of the
amount, often pitiful, assessed to our preachers for
their family expenses. And lastly, I call up as
witnesses of the fact of this unrighteous appropri
ation of the bounty of God to our factitious desires,
our imaginary wants, our sinful luxuries, and to
the gratification of our unholy and accursed love
of Mammon, the perishing tniilions of our race
annually hurried to the consummation of an un
known destiny, without a ray of gospel light, not
because there are not able men ready to bear the
lamp of salvation to them also, but because the
stewards of God’s appointing arc unfaithful to
to their sacred trust. Tell me, my brethren, are
not the barrenness of our own souls, the irreligion
of our friends and families, and the fearful wicked
ness of our people awful demonstrations, that the
curse of Jehovah is upon the. church for this soul
withering selfishness, which dams up the streams
of salvation, and permits the world to perish of |
thirst for the waters of life, which to us and to all !
flow most freely from the fountain of grace.

THE COMMUNION QUESTION.
Brother Wightman,—I have been for some time !
anxious to see some movement made in ourchurch
upon the communion question, and was not a little
gratified upon reading the preamble and resolutions
of the Perry circuit quarterly conference in your
paper of the 8th inst. The Temperance cause has
done and is still doing great good for our country,
and I believe if the church generally would come
to its help, it would accomplish much more than it
can without such help. I am a Temperance man
of the Tetotal order, and am doing what little'I
can to promote its cause in the church and out of
it; for, I speak it with shame, the church, in too
many instances, needs reformation in this particu
lar. Other denominations are making a move in
the subject of the resolutions, and I would not
have the Methodist Church in the rear of any. I
am happy to see the opinions expressed in the pre
amble and resolutions so freely agree with my own,
and am sorry to see that you, “ with all due re
spect,” differ from them. You say, “ We think it
past denial however, that the wine used by the
Corinthian church in the celebration of the eu
charist was fermented wine, and probably mixed,
since the apostle Charges them among other irreg
ularities with being 'drunken,' but although he
distinctly condemns their improprieties, yet, he
nowhere intimates that they used wine of an im
proper description.” The apostle “ nowhere inti
mates that the wine they used” was “ mixed,” and
yet you say it “probably” was. Nor does the
apostle “ intimate” that the wine used was of a
proper description. Is it presuming, then, too much
to suppose, that as they had corrupted the euchar
ist so tar as to drink to be “drunken;” they may
“ probably” have corrupted it so far as to use an
improper article 1 Again, you say, “ upon the
whole, we incline to the opinion, that where the
officers of a church procure the best and purest ar
ticle within their reach, there need be no trouble
of conscience about the matter.” It does seem to
me, this declaration of yours, is throwing wide
open the door for any thing in the name of wine to
be placed upon the communion table; for I venture
to assert, that in country-places where all efforts
are made to “ procure the best and purest article
in their reach,” nine times in ten, it is impossible
to procure any thing but a mixture of brandy, log
wood, beet-root, sugar of lead and alum, or some
such compound, without a particle of the juice of
the grape in it; and I doubt if you are more suc
cessful in your cities. Right or wrong, my “ con
science” will not let me partake of these vile Stuffs
as a proper symbol of the shed blood of my Sa
viour. I believe the wine of the ancients was
unfermented grape-juice, and might give several
authorities for this belief, but shall only give a few
extracts from Dr. Adam Clarke, who, I know, is
good authority among us. He says, “We find
that wine was anciently, the mere expressed juice
of the grape without fermentation. The suka or
cup-bearer took the bunches, pressed the juice in
to the cup and instantly delivered it into the hands
of his master.” And further,—when speaking of
the' sacramental cup he says, “ It will be of con
siderable use to ascertain what this cup contained^
Wino is not mentioned, but what is tantamount to
it is, viz, what our Lord calls the offspring of the
vine. Though this is the true and proper wine,
yet it was widely different from that medicated and
sophisticated beverage, that now goes under the
name of wine.” Again “This is a most wicked and
awful perversion of the Lord’s ordinance. The
matter, made use of by Jesus Christ, on this Bolemn
occasion, were unleavened bread and the produce
of the vine, that is, pure wine." It is, I believe, ad
mitted by all, that the eucharist is a substitute in
the Christian church, for the passover; and 1 be
lieve in every instance in the Old and New Testa
ment, whenever the passover, or eucharist,is spoken
of, the “fruit of the vine,” and not wine is used. I
infer, from reading the bible, there wore two kinds
of wine in use, one kind has a blessing upon it, the
other is disapprobated, or a curse is upon it, and
certainly, our Saviour would not use an article
upon which the curse of God rested, as a pro
per symbol of his shed blood. I would, how
ever, hold no quarrel with a brother who thought,
that fermented wine was admissible at the eucha
rist, and I am pleased with that feature of the 1st
resolution, that admits the use of fermented wine
when the unfermented cannot be had. I pre
sume this was done to prevent parties being
made in the church, knowing many good men be
lieved differently from them, their main object being
to drive from the table of the Lord, those alcoholic
and medicated articles, and to use an article known
to be made from the grape. It is stated in the pre
amble that “the greater portion of the wine of
commerce is manufactured and made of drugs and
other foreign substances, containing no portion of
the juice of the grape.” This is a fact well known
to all, who have paid much attention to this sub
ject, and yet we cannot get many to believe it.—
How many of those, even who minister in holy
things, when they ’ take the cup and give it to the
communicant and say, “ the blood of our Lord Jesus
Christ which was shed for you”—know that they
are offering that, which has produced so much
misery in the world and that has peopled eternity
with so many miserable beings. Again, it is said
in the preamble, “numerous well-established cases
could be furnished of persons being overthrown by
the use of the highly alcoholic wines commonly
used on sacramental occasions.” And is not this
too true 1 What amount of mischief has the
church done here, in furnisiiintr to its members in
its most holy ordinance, that, which has been the
means of ruining many, in their bodies and souls !
Do not start at this, as a thing impossible for the
church to do, but let us examine the thing and sift
it closely, for I believe, as is stated in one of the
resolutions, “ that the church has more at stake in
this respect than they perhaps are aware of.” It
is known to many, that he who once acquires a
habit of drunkenness, engenders a morbid state of
the system that no medical treatment can cure, and
nothing but temperate life can, and even when this
is practised for some time, a very small portion of
alcoholic drink will again fire up his appetite for
the stimulus, and in many instances so great is the
desire, that it drives the victim into excess, in spite
of all his desires for reformation. Let us look into
the history of the church, and it will astonish any
one who has not investigated this matter, to find
so many that have had this desire for strong drink
rekindled within them, by taking a sip of the alco
holic wine at the communion table. Who is there
among us, of much observation and experience,
that does not know of some unfortunate example.
I have now copies of letters from various indivi
duals stating the above fact; and some dare not take
the cup when it contains alcohol. The Methodist
church has a heavier responsibility in this matter
than any other. Her ministers go out into the
wilderness and highways of the country, and
through the lanes and alleys of the towns and
cities and gather into the pale of the church, many
inebriates who require all the nursing in her power
to assist them in living right; shall she be the first
one to offer them that, which will in all probability
drive many of them again into a course of intem
perance and ruin ! God forbid. I most anxiously
wish to see the day when all can surround the
table of our risen Saviour with perfect safety._
These thoughts arc offered in the best of feelings,
and hoping to contribute some little towards awak
ing up the church to what I think her solemn duty.
I am no minister, but an humble Layman.

GENERAL INTELLIGENCE
• FOREIGN.
Texan Prisoners in Mexico.—From another
conversation with Major Murray, one of the Mier
prisoners recently released through the instrument
tality of Mr. Bankhead, we learn that all the Tex
ans who have been confined during the past year in
Santiago, with the exception of six, are now at the
castle of San Juan de Ulua, near Vera Cruz, and
at work. Three were left at Santiago—Captain
Pearson, H. H. Van Vechter, and Ezekiel Smith—
all of them, either from age or sickness, unable to
travel. Three more—Alex. Mathews, Jeremiah
Leon and T. B. Malby—were left at the hospital at
Puebla, sick. Captain Baker, now at San Juan de
Ulua, is not compelled to labor. The unfortunate
Antonio Navarro, who was on the first Santa Fe
expedition and the only one of that party not releas
ed, is also at the castle of San Juan. Major Mur
ray speaks in the warmest terms of the kind treat
ment he received from Col. F. Bareta, the com
mandante of Santiago, and also of the attentions of
the prefect of San Juan del Rio and Dr. Jordan
while he was sick.
Duncan G. Ogden and Israel Canfield, the latter
released at the.requcst of Ex-President Adams, sail
ed from Vera Cruz for Pensacola in the U. S. brig
Somers.
It was while Mr. Bankhead was on his way from
Vera Cruz to Alanga de Clave, to hold his first in
terview and present his credentials to Santa Anna,
that he saw the Texan prisoners, then on their way
to the former place. They were then in plight
unfortunate, and escorted along with some eighty
Mexican criminals. Mr. B. requested the Presi
dent to release such of the prisoners as were En
glishmen, which request was complied with ; and
to this circumstance Mr. Murray and Mr. Donald
Smith owe their release. They came passengers,
as wo have before stated, in the John Barr, and re
quest us to return thanks to Capt. llollingshead for
h;s kind treatment on the voyage.
Peyton A. Southall, Esq., with despatches from
our Government, arrived at Vera Cruz in the So
mers and left on Sunday last for the capital. Gen.
Thompson was at Jalapa, on his way down, when
the John Barr sailed^*—JV. O. Picayune 31 »t ull.
Latest Prom Texas.—By the steamship New
York, Capt. Wright, from Galveston, we have pa
pers to the 28th inst. Among the passengers was
Com. Moore, who appears to be in excellent health
and spirits.
The Commissioners to Mexico have returned.
They reached Galveston on the 20th. The precise
terms and conditions for the continuance and termi
nation of the armistice have not transpired, and will
perhaps not be made public except from Washing
ton. It is understood that the two countries are to
maintain their present pacific positions towards each
other until Commissioners, to meet at the city of
Mexico have been appointed, and shall have ter
minated their labors, for the establishment of a per
manent peace between the two nations. The Mexi
can Government, it is said, is very much disturbed
at the prospect of the annexation of Texas to the
States, and well-informed persons in Mexico be
lieve that every effort will be made by that govern
ment to make it a condition, on the acknowlegment
of the independence of Texas, that she shall re
main separate from and independent of the United
Stales. It is thought that no great difficulty would
be found in procuring a recognition on this condition,
though Santa Anna might be disposed to cavil about
the boundary line between the two countries.
The most perfect understanding and good feeling
is said to exist between Gen. Murphy and President
Houston.
The National Vindicator, published at Washing
ton says that a war had broken out between the
Tonkahaway and Caddo tribes of Indians, and that
the former had been routed and driven into Austin.
The inhabitants of Austin declined rendering them
any assistance, although the Caddoes threatened to
pursue them to extermination.
All the border tribes, it is stated, are friendly
with the whites.
The principal object of Com. Moore in visiting the
United States, is to gather evidence to rebut some
uf the charges made against him.
The editor of the National Vindicator has it that
our fellow-citizen, Gen. Felix Houston, has been
killed off in a duel. This, we presume, is the first
intimation the General has had of the news.—N.

Statement of the Charleston Cotton Market.
April 9,1844.
Our Cotton market has been in a depressed state
for the last week, and prices were reduced to a
low Doint indeed; but accounts from New-York
received here yesterday, imparted new spirit to
holders, and said accounts having been confirmed
by the mail of to-day, we may now expect an ad
vance upon late prices. We are informed that the
New-York market has recovered all that it had lost
Bince the arrival of the last Liverpool steamer,—the
advance has been estimated as high a^ 6-8 of a
cent. We may look for a corresponding rise in
this market. 1-4 advance has already been obtained
over last week’s prices.
Arrival and reception of Mr. Clav.—Mr.
Clay arrived here about 2 o’clock. Preparations
were made for his reception in a manner becom
ing his public character. In King, from George
to VVentworth-streete, several beautiful arches
formed of Evergreens and Flowers were thrown
across King-street, with emblematical devices.
Mr. Clay was received at the Upper Depository by
the Whig Committee of Arrangements, where he
entered a handsome Barouche, drawn by four
splendid horses, and a procession being formed of
persons in carriages and on horseback, it proceeded
down King to Broad, down Broad to Meeting, and
up Meeting-street to the New Treatre, where Mr.
Clay was received by the Committee of Reception,
the Chairman of which, the venerable Revolution
ary soldier, Dr. William Read, addressed him in
eloquent terms, welcoming his arrival and tender
ing to him the hospitalities of the city. Mr. Clay
replied at some length.—Charleston Patriot of

Secret Treaties.—What stuff it is, to foist
upon the public taste, as food for scandal, that John
Tyler had negotiated a secret treaty !—as if these
wretched revilers did not know, that none but the
wild Indians of the forest ever negotiated any other.
I he treaty of 1603, by which we acquired Louis
iana,—was it everywhere discussed before the
people and in the press, as the Texas Treaty now
is! No such thing. The negotiations were kept
profound secrets. It was agreed to, drawn, signed,
sealed, and sent to the Senate Chamber in secresy ;
there it was debated in secresy; and when it first
came forth to the public notice and challenged its
approval, behold, it was a Ratified Treaty! Such
was the Treaty of Florida. Such was the late
Treaty of Washington,—and yet the infuriate mad
ness ui party would lash John Tyler through the
land, for a scrupulous observance of the very cus
toms which all his predecessors have followed,_
and to the observance of which, their very successes
are attributable !—Jiichniund Enquirer.
Election of Trinity Church Vestry._An
election for Vestrymen of Trinity Church Corpor
ation in New York, takes place on Monday next
It will be recollected, says the Herald that during
the Episcopal Convention, last summer, a serious
division took place in the church, on certain “ obso
lete ideas” of faith, called by the modern name of
l’useyism. ■ This division has been widening and
increasing ever since, and a great effort will be
made by each of the two divisions to elect Vestry
men of Trinity Corporation of their own side. It
is estimated that the real estate of Trinity Church
in New York, is worth, at present valuation, about
$30,000,000. It is true, the present income, in
consequence of long leases, does not exceed $45,
000 during the last year; but these leases are rap
idly expiring, and in a few years the annual in
come will reach half a million or more. The Ves
trymen to be elected on Monday next have the
control of all this vast property.
New Invention.—A set of Carpenter’s Planes,
made of cast-iron, has been shown to us by Mr.
E. W. Johnson, Lombard-street, near Ligth, who
is tho agent for their sale in this city. The inven
tion is that of Mr. William Foster, and the articles
are of Maryland Iron, cast and finished at the
works of the Savage Cotton Factory, near this city.
These tools are but a trifle heavier than those of
wood, and cost the same price; and as they are
made of materials which cannot warp or Spring,
the advantage they possess over others is apparent.
We learn that at the Navy Yards at Washing
ton and Philadelphia these cast-iron planes are
used to great advantage, and preferred to all
others.—Halt. Amer.
Despicable.—At Cincinnati, on the 6th instant,
a sprig of the U. S. Navy entered one of the hotels
of that city, and in the course of a few hours ran
up considerable of a bar bill, which he had not the
means to liqudate. The landlord, never having
seen him before, suggested that he had better
leave his sword, which he had with him, and he
consented to leave it until the following morning
in pawn for a bar bill. It is a pity that men, in.
stead of monkeys, cannot be appointed ofliccrs in
our Navy.
Signs as to Texas—The Houston (Texas)
