TEXAS.
BRy the arrival of the steame: Neptune,
captain Rollins, from Galveston, we have
received papers up to the 2nd November.
On the 17th October, information was
ven at Head Quarters, by Mr. John W.
mith, that Gen. Woll was positively on
the Nueces, and that on the 8th he had re.
ceived a reinforcemnent of about 500. and
that all the militia of Eastern Mexico w1
ordered to his essistance, and would reach
the Nueces in less than ten days from date.
The Mexicans living in and about San An
tonia, are quite ipdependent, and directly
boast of their defence against the troops,
to wit: That Gen. Woll will came for the
remaioder of them, &c.; that contrary to
their customary hospitality heretofore ex
tended to the troops at that point, have
clandestinely drove their beef and stocks
some 25 or 30 miles south, to secure them
on their march to the Rio Grande, and
speak more free of the matter than for
merly. Mr. Smith is rully satisfied of the
fact that the enemy at the Neces will
amount to 500 or 6000 in 10 days; and
Gen. Woll has regular communication
with the Mexicans of San Antonia; that
in bis opinion they cannot any longer be
recognised even as neutrals, much less
friends. in this expedition.
About 1400 Tesian troops were assem
bled at Gonzales no the 17th October.
A letter written by a gentleman at La
Grange, under date of 25th October, says:
that there was 300 men assembled at that
Slace who would commence crossing the
' orado on the next day. The river was
,we high, and would retard the passage
.of e troops several days. Gen. Burle
ann passed through that place on the 24th
nit. on his way home, and stated that 400
troops would turn out frot fla-strop and
Travis counties, and it was believed there
would be 3.000 mea at San Antonio by the
6th of November.
A gentleman who left it,-xar on the 19th
October. says: that the spies who went in
pursuit at deneral Wool, followed the trail
ofhis army about thirty miles beydhd the
Nueces, and found carts, wagons. and ar
tietes of furniture strewn along the road.
that had been apparently left to expedite
his Bight. The spie. say that the trail
indicated that be tied with great precipita
tine. and stopped to build camp fires only
once or twice on the route to the Presidio.
Prisoners.-A gentleman from Gon
males, states that it was reported at that
place the prisoners lately captured by Gen.
Wpil, are at Santa 'Rosa. a snall village
about tifty miles west of- the Presidio. ot
amt road to Mlonterry. It is reported that
Gen. Wool mentioned, just berore he left
Bxear, that they would probably be re
leased in two months, or as soon as news
cosid be received from Mexico. The

Cotton.-Six hundred and oighty-three
hales ofeotton have been shipped from
Houston since the 13th of July lust. Tb'e
Byron took away 208 hales on the 23d nit.
Te new cot ton is now daily arriving, and
the receipts amount to about twenty bales
per day. Notwcithtstanding the ravages orf
the worm, the drought and the wet weath -
er, the amount of cotton shipped this year
from Houston, will in all probability be
fully egual to the amount shipped last year.
Here is an item worth looking and
laughing it:

Egypt and China. where there is no pro

"The cotton goods of this country, par
ticularly the cheaper descriptions, are
brought to such perfection that they take

had volunteered to defend the persons ac

Adams writes that he has not dlone en;
that lhe has never espressed any opinion
favorable to the protections of Dorr, nor
ay unfavorable to the course taken by the
constituted atborittes of the State. He
has however, at the earrest solicitation of

TO TIlE PARENTS AND GUAR
DIANS OF EDGEFIELD DIS
TRICT.
Tin Teachers, composing the meeting
held at the Court House, on the first Mon
day in November, respectfully represent;
that Common Sc'iools. next to parents,
are the most important agents in the busi
ness of instructiot), and next to Common
Schools, furnished iv ith competent Teach
ers, is a judicious and uniform selecton of
elementary books. A good beginni is
one half towards the accomplbuut, of
ygood sork,:fod a
business oeduca proesm i.te.'1
witti books beyond their ca lcty ofn- d
drta':ding, is fatally injurious to the ac
quisirion of a taste for reading, without
which the mind is thrown upon its own re
sourcesi, deprnved of almost any helpkom
the ex perience of others; at least thet lp
wi ie confined to 'he limited circle of an
every day acquaintance-to what is seen
witth the eyes, or heard with the ears. To
remedy this evil, the teachers have agreed
to recommend the boozks reported by the
commintee, to be used in the Schools of
this District.
In making the selection, the Teachers
would not be understood as condemning
alt others on the same subject, but from a
vart:y of works presented to them, they
tae aigieed upon those which they think
most lhkely to adJvance the object they
have tin view. One work only have they
codem ned,viz. WV ay land's Moral Science.
This work contains doctrines inimical to
thc institutionis of thle South; sentiments
which shotuld not appear in a work on
31 oral Science. u nless conforming to some
ther codec than thut derived from the
Scriptures. 'l he opioions set forth is the
above work, wre conceive, to be erroneous,
dagerous in the extreme, and meriting
the condemnation of Southern Teachers
and Parents.
all parents al guardians to assist them
n the responsible and arduous duty they
have undertaken, of instructing the youth
ful maind. This, in part, can be done by
frnishin'g each pupil with proper books,
as they may be needed. The expense of
teaching and books, they fear, deter too
many trom giving their children a proper
education, but they may be assured that a
well educated child1 is far more likelywi
repay his parents for their care of him,
thai, one brought upi in ignorance. The
parent who de.:res iii child to be happy
n haimself, respectable in society, aid a
blesing to others, abiould not neglect to
furnish him the tmenus of studying those
sujetswi will conduce to these ends.
