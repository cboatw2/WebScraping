I.mp30vemement of live STOCK.
The following remarks on this subject
we copy from Ellsworth's Swine Breeder.
The farmer who wishes to effct an improvement
of his stock will do so, either
^ by the immediate and entire removal of
existing breeds, and the substiiu:ion of
others in their room ; or by selecting the
best individuals of the variety he has on
hand, and improving them in this way
for successive years ; or, lastly, by crosses
with a Superior male of some different
breed.
The first method proposed is liable to
objections, on account of the expenditures
"which it involves, and the probable difficulty
of obtaining a suitable number of
females of the improved stock from which ,
it is propo>ed to breed.
The adoption of the second mode must
be determined from the fact, whether the
existing stock is adapted to the nature
of the farm, together wi i the circumstances
of the cuitivatoi and his mode of
cultivation
The third mode is that from which the
judicious orceder of stock will derive the
most advantage, and which of course he j
wiil most naturally adopt. To aid him in ]
so doing, we annex the following valua- j
ble hints on the improvement of inferior'
breeds by crossing, from the excellent
"Elements of Practical Agriculture," by
Mr. Low. "Tilis "method has often led
,?? to disappointment from the nature of the
crosses attempted, especially where the
crosses have been violent, as between animals
of very different character. The
first cross will in general be good, but in
breeding from the progeny of the cross. cx?
pectation will often be disappointed. Nor
do the good ualities of the lirst cross always
remain in the progeny, but oft? w
there are found in its defects which cannot
be traced to the parents.
"This, however, generally comes from
injudicious crosses, and Irom unncquaintancc
with the principle on which the
^ crosses of different animals should lie con.
ducted. When a cross is made it shoul
be with a male of superior breed, and in
this rnsn the first cross will be almost
always a good animal. To secure the
full benefits of the cross, however, ire
should not too has'ihj resort to the males oj
the inferior stock, because it might be
found that while we had injure] the otiginal
breed, we had not substituted a better
in its stead. The general rude, therefore.
should he, to cover again the first cross
rciih a superior male of the same, breed
and so on, until the good character of that
breed bceotnes pcrmanr.n' in the progeny.
This is said to be breeding up to the parent |
f. stock.
"There are, indeed, numerous cases in
which a single mixture of better biood will i
do good, as with those inferior breeds
which have no fixed characters. These
? ili be improved by even the slightest admixture
with the blood of a better race;
and a farmer who is in a district where
this class of animals prevails, may safely
avail himself of a good male, in the same
manner as a breeder of horses would do.
although the stallion were of a different
character from the native stock. The
cases where crossing is to he attempted
with caution, are when a breed of estab
lished good characters, or of characters
which fit it for the nature of the country,
and the state of its agriculture, already
exists.
"Now we might breed from animals
nenxly allied to one another in blood, as
brothers and sisters, parents and thiir
offspring, technically called 'breeding "inand-in,'
or from animals of different fumI
ilies. By the latter method are produced
animals more hardy and less subject to
disease; by the former we are frequently
enabled to produce animals of more delicate
form, and greater fattening propcrF
ties, and above all to giro a greater permanence
to the characters of the parents
[ in the olfspring. The first improvers,
r indeed, found the practice to be, to a
V certain extent, necessary, because they
could not resort to the males of other fam\ilies
without employing inferior animals,
and so impairing the properties of their
own breed.
"It is to be observed4 that the breeding
and continuing to breed from animals very
* near of blood, produces aD:rrrals which
have a greater tendency to arrive at maturity
and to become fat. This seems to
result from a tendency to premature age
r
t
Jim
C11ERA
I in the animal, which thus more quickly
j arrives at maturity, of hone and muscle,
and so begins sooner to secrete fat.
j "The system, however, of breeding
from animals near of blood has its limits,
i Nature will not be forced too fast for our
! purposes. It is known that although the
'joining of animals closely allied dirninj
ishes the size of the bone and gives a
: tendency to fatten in the progeny, it ren!
dors them also more delicate and subject
j to diseases. Although, then, this near
i breeding may be carried to a limited exj
tent, between very fine animals, for the
j purpose of rendering their qualities per!
rnanent in the offspring, we do a violence
to nature when we carry it too far. The
| progeny, along with their maturity and
j aptitude to fatten, become feeble, and
the males lo e their maculine character,
j and become incapable of propagating
1 their race.
I W hen, therefore, the stock of any farJ
mer has become too nearly allied, he
i ought not to fail to change his males,
j and procure the best of the same breed,
j Tuis is essential to preserve the health of
the stock for any time. Great losses
! ..ave been sustained bv breeders who
! have carried the system of close breeding
too fur, with the design of pushing the
improvement of their breeds to its lim{iu."*
I A common error has existed in this
! eountrv, in regard to swine, which has
I
I led to selection of breeds with reference
: to great size and weight, rather than to
. other good points, and especially the
| amount of valuable meat they can he
! made to carry. The flesh of smaller
| breeds is in general far more delicate and
! better flavored than that of large ones,
; while the proportional expenditure of each
j is the same. "It was lately remarked,"
says N. C. Bement, Esq., in his Report
! from the Committee on Swine, "!>y an
eminent breeder of England, Mr. Cray,
at an agricultural dinner, that he could
feed on an acre of land, a greater number
of pounds in mutton, in carcasses from 18
to 20 lbs. p?r quarter than in carcasses
from 28 io 30 lbs. per quarter, and that a
quarter of mutton from a sheep of 18 to
20 lbs. weight per quarter, and that consequently
the advantage is on the side of
the smaller carcasses. And he assigned
tins among other reasons, that in case of,
drought or scarcity, a small animal can
collect as much food as a larger one, and
uaving a smaller carcass, it derives more
idvantnge from it; that whilst the larger
?.s losing in condition, the smaller one, if
not improving, is remaining stationary,
tud when the period arrives at which ari
ihundance of food can he obtained, it
i!most immediately reaSSumes its position
! and is fit to go to market sooner than the
| larger animal." "These remarks are
I found to hold good in regard to swine as
well as sheep. The same quantum of
bod that will give 600 pounds to hogs of
very large breed, will fatten two hogs of
300 pounds each, and the meat of the
'at tor though not so fat will be of the better
quality."
With many breeders, the sole consideration
seems to be, the obtaining of a
j breed, possessing aptitude to mature and
fatten speedily. That these arc points of
great importance, no one would deny.
Vet it should he remembered that it is
not alone the quantity but the kind of fat
! which is desirable, and that those breeds
arc most desirable, in which this end can
be accomplished with the greatest economy
of food.

Rapid Growth in Swine?Method of
Feeding.
I W e give th system of feeding swine,
I as practised with success by one who has
j much experience, has made many experiments,
and is among the most intelligent
on this subject. We do not suppose that
; this mode of feeding is well suited to the
I farmer, who can feed with less expense
; on apples, pumpkins, and a larger proporI
tion of roots, but it shows a irnthod of u:
sing grain to advantage, which will be ini
c o o 7
j teresting to every one.
1 As to the growth in this case, it was
! not ascertained with precision, excepting
j in one instance. A pig was weighed at
i bo lbs. and in four and a half days he was
weighed again on the same balance, and
o d 7
in the same state as to fullness, and his
weight was 93 lbs. It was supposed that
j other pigs in the herd gained as much, if
I not more than this one which was the sub1
ject of particular experiment.
There wero 50 pigs in the herd, all in a
; thriving condition, and weighing on an
I a vera 20 about 75 lbs. each. They were
! fe l twice a day on scalded corn meal,
| with a little raw corn thrown to them at
each time. Boiling water was poured
| upon the meal, and thoroughly mixed to
i scald it; this cooked it in some measure,
| and in a short time cold water was added,
! so ns to make it sufficiently cool, and in
this way three pecks of meal made about
a barrel of food.
About half a bushel of raw sucar beets
; was given three tunes a day. With the
meal was a small quantity of salt fish

< l'nis lot of pigs usually eat about the
j following quantities per day. 1 1-2 bush|
els meal; 5 to 8 lbs old cheap salt iish; 1 1-2
bushels beets and 23 livers. The above
food would be very cheap, excepting the
livers, the price of which we do not know,
and in making excellent pork we should
choose to dispense with them. The hog
is doubtless partially cariverous and will
thrive better for having some animal food,
but it does not produce pork so palatable
as that made from vegetable food.

Geo. W. Nesmith. Esq.?Dear Sir
?Agreeably to your request, I will give
you an recount of my crops of corn anc
pota oes, and also of the process of cultivation.
My M-tiiod has been, for t
number of jc .rs to plant sward land
and, not to turn it up but a few days be
' - - - i i :ii
I lore piuniin.1; anu 1 win gi*o m,
rea ons fir so doing. By letting it b<
nil the grass gets started, and the worm;
get into the sward, ar.d then turning then
under, they are more likely to stay in tlx
sward till the corn gets up, and out o
their way. And another advantage is
'.he grass and weeds do not get up before
the first hoeing.
Tne piece of corn you looked at first
was on rather a dry piece of ground, ,?in<
| I spread about 23 loads of barn mifnun
to the acre, on the grass and turned i
under, and about ten loads of compos
manure, (which I consider better thai
clear barn manure, for it will not dry uj
so quick,) in the hill. The produce o
that piece was 97 1-2 bushels to the acre
The piece on the meadow, I ploughcc
j deep and spread about twenty-five load:
I of b irn manure to the acre, and harrowei
it wel', rolled it down smooth, and furrow
ed it, and put ahnut ten loads of composi
manure in the hill; and the produce wa:
9-1 1-2 bushels of shelled com.
I.i the piece of Rohan Potatoes yoi
j looked at there were 64 rods of ground
j well manured; only the manure that wa:
j put in the hill was mostly straw, and the
I drought was so severe, the manure wa<
dry when we dug them; if it had beer
compost manure I think I should hav(
! had one fourth more potatoes. The pro
duce on 01 rods was 143 bushels.
Kesj ectlully yours,

31 ANY CROP EXPERIMENTS.
I have before made known in the col
umns of the Cuitivator, my entire succes:
| in a double crop as to Irish potatoes am
i pumpkins; or that by planting pumpkin;
among potatoes after lhe vines of the lat
ter were of some size, a fine crop of the
former overspread the ground, rather t<
the healthful shading than to the detri
mentofthe potatoes matured underneath
Of late years I have sowed buckwhea
and rye at the same tiaic and on th<
same ground; and success attended. Thi
buckwheat was cut in the fall, and ry?
the following harvest. Again, in our ho
| climate, and on our light sandy soil,
have hit upon a plan that renders re;
clover of as certain growth and success a
in the northern states, if not more so.?
j It is bv covering the ground with pin
I leaves after the wheat and clover an
sowed; or cover the wheat in the winte
and sow the clover in the spring. Las
i September a year, I sowed a piece o
I ground with wheat and clover on th
1 fresh earth immediately after the when
Urr/urn,l in fiml vr?fin nftp.r Utlt OVC
j n uo atui ?v?* vv? fti*y ? I
] most of the surface pine leaves. Th
' wheat anil clover were both essentiall
benefitted by the covering, and a remark
able contrast, to that left uncovered to tes
| the utility of the plan.
The fifth of August last, I resolve
upon a fourfold operation on a piece c
} ground, and after sowing thereon bud
j wheat and rye, and then clover. I covere
, most of it with pine leaves, straw, an
green pine houghs, or with the differer
materials in different places, coated.ovc
, about an inch thick. The result promise
j to be very satisfactory. And a most <h
J cided difference in favor of the groun
( thus covered. I had the curiosity, the 5t
. of October, to measure the buckwhei
i from a corner of the piece, less than a qua
ter of an acre, and the produce was fiv
j and a Half bushels. Both the rye an
i clover look very promising for next yeai
j crops. Very respectfully yours &c.

t We shodtd be pleased to hear from some
of our friends of Talbot, and other parts ol

J arrived?The business ofthe husbandman
1 is no longer considered as an inferior one,
' and instead of crowding our stocked-cities

? or the learned professions, we are pleased
1 to observe so many fathers providing tnen

? gratifying to find that these yoing mcr
are desirous of travelling out of the beater
, tracks of by-gone ages, so far at least a<
to avail themselves of the lights of science
t) and the experience of enlightened men ir
the duties of their calling. To aid al

under a bu he!, hut to let ii he seen afar
otf; to direct the way faring pilgrirr
,,through life* in order that he may wit!
more ease arrive the sooner at the desirot
haven of competence and contentment
We earnestly app.-al to the enlight.
* ened agriculturists of Maryland, noi
1 to pass this subject by, but to reracm
s her their responsibilities, and that they art
. not to live for themselves alone, but fo
? the benefit of their fellow-incn likewise, s<
> far at least as is consistent with the talen
with which they have been entrusted.
For the American Farmer.
. Many articles have appeared in th<
a American Farmer, in relation to th<
" value of the different breeds of cattle. Thi
Devons and the Durhamsseem to be th<
favorites. When in good condition, thej
t i tiu
are cermuuy iicautiiui nuur, uut ? u^uu
' them both iuferior lo the Tinians. as I re
J collect them forty years ago on Wye Is
s land. Perhaps if measured by the moderi
- scale of perfection, their backs would no
e be found exactly horizontal, and thei
2 flanks sufficiently pendant. The Iat<
r John B. Bordley, in his husbandry, state
t that he obtained the breed, from a bull im
f ported by Mr. Calvert, and he inferrei
from their corresponsive appearance, tha
t the stock was carried from the Island .0
Tinian to England, by Lord Anson, wh
r touched there in his voyage round th
e world. Brooks, in his Gazetteer, states
v, the island of Tinian is situated in the Pa
cific Ocean, in 15 degs. N, L., that it i
12 miles in length, and 6 in breadth, an
has on it at least 10,000 cattle, all of ther
d milk white, except their ears, which ar
>f brown, or black. In my early recol
i- lection of the cattle on Wye Island, Bord
d ley removed to Philadelphia, his part c
d the Island went into the hands of thelat
it Arthur Bryon?He sold the cattle free!
t by winch m:inv herds in Talbot and Quce
Ann s Co. were much improved; but littl
J- of the Tinian blood now remains in Mar)
d land. Mr. Jns. Murray, of Annapoli
h has some cows, which have a dasli of it
it and when Mr. Skinner again visits the ar
r* eient city, I should be pleased if he woul
e scan and inquire of their properties s
d milkers. Mr. Turner, a Baltimore butch
rs er, has carried some of them from this pai
of the country into market, and could ir
form of their properties for beef. Som
). observation has satisfied me of the advat
tage of crossing the breed ofcattla? bi
I should prefer a hull from NewEnglan
jr to Old England. The best drove of f<
cattle I ever saw, came from New Eni
lv land, and the fine cheese and rich butt<
gt which comes from Rhode Island and Cot
;h necticut, proves the value of their cow
w for milk. Three years ago an intelligei
Connecticut farmer was at my housed

ted cattle, but said theirs was of the r id
stock okthe country. I think those cattle
would suit our climate and our habits
much betterthan the English; fori cannot
agree that Northern men or Northern
bulls would necessarily degenerate as far
South as Maryland. On the contrary, I
think that a stall and pasture might here
be found, in which an exiled bull would
have no cause to regret the rich fields and
pleasant valleys of Andalusia.
I saw the Tcesvvater cattlft, at the late
Gov. Floyd's soon after his purchase?
His cattle had been antecedently crossed
hy the Bakewells and thd Tinians. I
concur with Mr. Skinnor, that Mr. PfcnrJwas
satisfied with M a single, dip of Champion's
blood." He sold Champion and
the only bull calf that he raised from the
cows, to Col. Powel. As I recollect, he
esteemed theTinians the hardiest cattle
and the best milkers, both important considerations
on a grain farm.
Some years after the Champions were
introduced, I took some of thy cattle of
the cross of the Tinian upon the old stock
of the country ; they had been raised on
the rough provender of the farm, corn
shucks, corn tops, wheat straw, and grass
in season. The Champions exhibited,
had been nurtured with great care, and
took the first premiums, and mine the second.
Whether they were compare,1
with the Champioos, I do not now recollect.?I
think Mr. Skinner was there, and
may have some remembrance of the Show.
The high price of labor, and the grain
which is often poured into the Baltimore
market to a glut, by the accumu'ation of
the Tide water Canal, and the Rail Roads,
and our facility for transportation by
steamboats, admonishes us of the advan'
tage of appropriating a part of our arable
lands to grazing. The best breed ofcat
tlo and sheep has therefore become a mati
ter of no small consideration. An opinion
has been entertained that our lands
i were not adapted to the growth of the rich
i grasses. Under the three field system.
, when the grain crops came in rapid sue-1
i cession, and the grass-field was surcharged
with stock, which cut it to the root, in its
I early vegetation, a correct opinion was
- not entertained of the capabilities of our
i soil. A better system of agriculture, and
i the beneficial effects of marl, with which
i our country abounds, has been highly ini
structive ; and I entertain no doabt, that

, more than further to the North; but it

. be kept ch ar of hoof after winter sets in,
t it is in full luxuriance by the 11th of May,
a id our beeves can be sent fat into the
I Baltimore market by the 11th of June.
i This is not speculation, but the result of
1 ray own experience, in a small way. The
. jpass on our salt water rivers is not as
. soon affected by the frost as in the high
t country. We seldom have occasion to
feed our cattle until December. I turned

Scarcity of Mackerel.
A correspondent (says the Yarmouth
Register) suggests as a cause for tha
scarcity of Mackerel, the general practice
of using. 'Hardhead* for bait, the sharp .
hones of which fish kill the Mackerel that
feed upon it. The suggestion is worthy
[ofconsideration, at least.
The same paper gives a statement of
the Mackerel inspected in Massachusetts
during the last ten years as follows viz:
Toial for 1840 50 992 barrels.
? 1839 73,018 "
" 1838 108.938 ?

Cold Comfort for Office Seekers.?The
annual appropria ion bill, which was re*
ported by Mr. Jones last week, contains a
new and very important provision. The
Administration party as they are going
out of power, have very adroitly hit upon
apian to enforce upon their successors a
system of economy which they thcmsalves
have always preached, hut never practised.
The appropriation provides that all
Clerks of U. 8. Courts, all Marshalls and 4j|*
District Attorneys, shall render to the
government annually an account of their
fees and emoluments, and every shilling
over $6000 per annum to go into the public
treasury. It is supposed by the Vnn
Buren men that the Whigs about tocoine
into power on the profession of reform and
retrenchment, cannot vote against the
measure, as that would contradict their
promises to the peoole; and thus they hope
to cut off the large profits which their own
friends have enjoyed. The provision will

very large sum will thus be saved to the
people.
An amendment is to be proposed, restricting
Collectors and Postmasters in the
same manner as the officers above named.
