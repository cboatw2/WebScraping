States, unless the Government choose j
to discard all bank agency.
And the main considerations against it
are?
1. That the Federal Government ought not
to be dependent on the legislation of ^
tho State Governments tor (he means ot
conducting the business of the Treasury, j
2. The perpetual liability of the State
banks to excess of issues, and to suspension
of specie payments.
3. The difficulty of giving a national j

essentially local in their nature and use*,
and in their currency.
1. The liability of the system to political
abuse.
The system of nn independent Treasury
is recommended?
1. Beca use of its independence of nil
agency not the Government's and especially i
because independent of banks
2. Because it holds the public funds fur the
pu blic use only.
3. Because, by the use of coin only in the
dealings of the Treasury, it tends to bring
back the country to the money standard of
th? Constitution.
.4nd it is opposed?
1. Because, by tiie oxclus-ve use of coin,
it rejects 'lie time-saving ami labor-saving
instrumentality of paper, which, so it bo of
specie value, is iu many respects preferable in
use to coin.
2. Bccagse it locks up the public, funds from
all employment, either directly or xz the bas_
is of paper issues.
2. Became, under if, the United Slates
Las no paper currency of national circulation.
4. Because it separates the Government
from the People, and disavows all incidental
duly towards the latter in the busiuess ol the
Treasury.
Which of these three systems is the cheapest
and safest, that is insohes the least expense
and loss to the Treasury, is no otherwise
iin|>orfaiit than as it may be* a question of
charge on the revenue; and which of them is
p* most convenient, in a fiscal point of vew, is a
matter of uo interest except to the Government
T?e Committee do not b?li< ve that t!ie wit
of man can devise anv scheme of finance
which will satisfy every mind, or which shall
combine the whole of the advantages and
shun the whole of the d sadvautaees of the
different plans, on winch, at successive periods,
the Government has hitherto acted. Ail
human institution is mixed of good and evd.
Jt is our duty, if we cannot do all the good we
would, to attempt at least to do ail we Can.
And the Commute are of opinion that ntauv
of the advantages of the different systems
heretofore adopted and successively rejected
by the Government are to be found, and many
ot the disadvantages are not found. :n the
plan of a Board of Exchequer recommended

The 1'resident of the United States, in

requires him to recommend to their consideration
such measures as he shall judge necessary

give to those views a free and unbiased examination.

It remains now for Congress to act in the
matter; the country demands that in some way
we shall act; and the times appeal to us to
act with decision, with m ideration, with impartially,
with independence. ng enough,
the question of the national finances has been j
the sport of passion and the battle-cry of party.
Foremost of all things, the country, in order
to recover itself, needs repose and order for its
material interests, and a settled purpose in

etmammgroiPmi
zctte?" We answer, It sulxstitules written
or printed testimony for parole, and
the written is, intrinsically, the stronger
of the two. But the Carolinian affirms
that we "chose to alter it, for the purpose
of giving effect to particular* passages,"
by putting these passages in italics and
capitals. It is doubtless annoying to our
? I.. IMS.
u*Mt;ui|MJ! ?i | y iu M't; IllCSt; "|mi itLuiui
?ages," and especially t? see them in
italics and capitals. It would ho equally
annoying to hear the letter read with suitaMe
emphases and pauses, for the purpose
of giving effect to these same "particular
passages " But "how does that alter the
case between us and the'' Carolinian??
"We hog" adds the Carolinion "to keep to j
the true issue." Exactly ri"ht : and the
O
prayer of lite petition was granted long
before it was presented.
What is the issue? It is, whether the
Legislature absolutely rejected the Slate's
share of the proceeds of the public lands,
?or intended in case the policy of distribution
should he persisted in, and distribution
should actually take place among
the othei states, that South Carolina
should in that case, receive her share
ilso? What was the understanding on
this point? This is the question. Now I
to the evidence.
The following resolution was before j
the House of Representatives for consideration
:
"Resolvld that the State of South Carolina
will not receive, and that tho Governor
be requested and enjoined not lo
appoint an agent, to receive such portion ,
of the proceeds of the public lands as mny j
be appropriated to this Stale under the j
late Act ef Congress."
If this resolution bad passed without!
change it would have been an absolute I
rejection of the State's share of the mon- j
ey. And on this very ground it was op- j
posed by Messrs. Pcrrv, Frost, Henry, i
Painter and Bellinger. It was advocated
by Messrs. Hunt and Rbett, hut their argumcnts
could not prevail with the
House. Those of their opponents, j
against the resolution in its original form,
(ltd prevail. And what were they? Mr.
Frost, "thought we ought not to take too
' o r*
high ground ; it was sufficient not to ap
point an agent to receive?Hn re were j
manv contingencies which we ought to i
. I
anticipate ; tor, if.some of the States refused
to accept and accumulated a fund, '
and the question came up to divide this !
surplus, how ought we to act ? Swell J
the proceeds to those States who are dis- j
posed to oppress us? He apprehended
not." Mr. Henry supported Mr. Frost;
he was not disposvd to commit the State."
'He would give no pledge that the State
would never receive the money." "He
was for postponing the action of the State, j
He was not for Cutting somersets1 Mr.
Bellinger "thought there whs no necessity
to decide the question of receiving the
money now 'He would not go farther
than declare nt present we ought not to
appoint a receiver, and he careful 01 what
language we use now?wait until ice find
the act cannot be repealed, and then say
what we shall do. If we can't do this,
WE WILL THEN RECEIVE IT; as
to refuse it will he playing jnlotho hands
of other States?If we refuse the $?(),000
the deficiency in the treasury will still j
have to he supplied." Mr. Bellinger after
these and other remarks of similar
imnnrf- in order to enrrv out his views.
r- > - ^ - |
inovod to amend the resolution by sub- J
stituiing "This Legislature will not np-'
point a.y agent to receive" in the
place of ??Thc State of South Carolina will
not receive"&c< and the amendment was I
adopted. Now observe that the leading,
reason assigned by Mr. Bellinger for t.is
motion was that lie wished to allow the
State to receive her share of the money
in case the distribution act should not he
repealed and the motion made for this
avowed purpose was immediately adopte 1
by the House* w ithout any different reason
being assigned for it. The Sena e
knowing these facts,?for the account
of the proceedings in the House had been
published before the Senate acted upon
the resolution?the Senate, we say knowing
the change which bad been made by
the House in the resolution, and the reason
for this change, took tip the resolution
nnd passed it just as it had passed the
House# and without even an attempt, so
far as we ever lenrnt, to restore it to its
original form, or to give it any other form
that would import a rejection of the
money.
On this evidence which has heen several
times published, and never controverted,
does it appear that the Legislature
definitively rejected the . State's
share of the proceeds from the public
lands? Not at all. On the contrary,
for the very purpose of preventing such
interpretation of its act, the resolution
was changed, and an amendment adopted
which had been proposed avowedly with a
view to (he State's ultimately receiving
its share of the money, provided the distrihution
act should not he repealed.
The design of those who drafted the
original resolution seems to have been the
rejection of the money. But the House,
not having the same design, changed the
resolution to suit its own intention;
which obviously was only to express decidedly
nndemphatically the State's disapprobation
of the distribution net, without
committing itself for the future. As
this was the attitude asttinted by the State
it is the attitude in which it ought to be
presented to the public, from regard both
to justice and to its character, should it
in future receive the money. There was
no disguise in the- Legislature. The ob
ject of the resolution, ns amended was
openly avowed in public debate by those
who opposed and defeated the original
resolution ; and the design of receiving
the money should distribution take place,
was also openly avowed by those v^bo j
were most active and most influential in
the proceedings which took place.
In the preceding columns will be found j
the able report of Mr. Cuahing in the
House of Representatives on the Exchu- ;
quer project of (ho President; together
with n synopsis of the bill which accoinpa- j
nicd the icport. Two minority reports ,
were also made bv members of the same '
committee ; one by Mr. Davis of Ken
tucky, and the other by Mr. Kennedy of!
Maryland, the latter accompanied by a
hill to establish a national hank, similar
to the first bill passed at the extra session.
In the Senale, Mr. Tuilmadgo also j
made a from the committee to,
which the same subject had been referred
|,v tingjyjjy, accompanied by a hill. The
folowing is a synopsis from the report
itself of the plan adopted by the commit- !

J New York has bona fide consented to :
j comply with a demand heretofore made j
, by the authorities of Virginia, for the swr- j
I render of Peter Johnson, Edward Smith I
' and Isaac Gansey, as fugitives from jus- i
ticc: and that the Legislature of this |
State has repealed a law passed in 1840,
extending the right of trial by jury, to
| persons claimed as owing service in other
; States, under proceedings before the offii
ccrs and magistrates of this State,
i It seems my duty, therefore, with the
j frankness of communication, which ought j
j to prevail between the several States of?
j the Union, to make known to your Rx? |
cellency as 1 have uniformly, nnd on all
proper occasions informed the State or !
Virginia, that the Executive of thir State j
declined to comply with the leouisition
of the Executive of ^ irgin.^i, referred !
to in cho act of South Carolina, upon the
grounds that the process was deemed to
bo without warrant or authority in (ho
Cdhstituiion of the United States, or in
the laws and customs of this Stale, and |
that nothing has occured since' the de- '
j cision was made to change the conviction j
j then entertained.
Whether the law of this State extend- i
<.? __!
ing the trial oy jury oa uneonsuiuuonni m i
injurious to the State of South?|lijaroiina, 1
or to any other State, is a question. v? hich 1
>roper!v belongs to the LegislatfVerlicp* j
esen to lives of the People, and has hifirlf j
:oinmended to their respectful consider*. *|mH
;on. It dlso belongs to thoni to consider j
Lt least in the first instance, whether the > j
neasure which the State of South Caro- :]
tan has adopted calls for anv action on- - ^
he part of this State. I have, therefore, ^
rcry cheerfully complied with vour Ex- m
