I WASHINGTON,-July 29.
r. In Senate, this morning, Mr.--Alan glim
reported from the Committee on -Naval
gp'v'V.'AlFairs, the bill from the Ilonse making
appropriations for naval pensions. The
? . J ,
Pavy pension Amd was origionally created
l>y appropriating a portion of the money
.x received fioof the sale of prizes captured '
r : during the IS*) war with Great Britain,
" and was intended fur the relief of the widows
of those who had fallen in battle.. It
was restricted to this purpose until 1837.
when a hill was so amended as to give
pensions to all who had incurred ' disabilities,"
and to the widows of ail who died
while in the public service. Under this
r-. -U- Jaw, which was made retroactive, if a
man had died in the public service, five
minutes after he entered it, of disease
I? previously contracted, his widow was en
tilled to a pension, ami a case was cited of
a petty officer who entered the service
about the year 1820, and in. iive days af- ,
terdied. Undlr the act of 1837, his.wid.
ow recovered sevnrhl thoOsaod do I liars as
arrears of pension from the (late of his
death to the passage of the" law." If was
also stated that there .are now" officers in j
&&*</. command of line of battle ships, and re- (
ceiving full pay, who are also receiving a
?r - . pension for total disability. This soon i
dissipated the fund?interest and principal, i
and the bill reported to-day, made an ap- <
proprialion from the Treasury for the pay- j
ment of the pensioners. The second sec- <
* ... ?Il.a nf ,
Fnon was iiueuneo u? ?c|?ra. ,,
... 1837, and restrict the pensions to the class
for whom they were originally provided. |
It was, howeVer, somewhat ambigiously
expresset^^and Mangum moved to strike <
. '"which would make it a mere appro, i
priation of money for naval pensions t
withot ant! restriction, and leave the law |
of 1837 in full force. Mr. Calhoun 1
-.-pointed out this as the result, and said the
better way would be to amen the section (
trt make it explicit. This was op- j
^^gr^tjyby Mr. Mangum and other whtgs, t
^onrthe^piciof a want of time to examine i
the subject fully, and that it might oper- r
ate harshly in some cases. Mr. Calhoun j
said these individual cases would recom- a
mend themselves to the special legislation, l
and insisted on the propriety of at once j
putting a stop to the abuse. Mr. Wood- t
bury then offered an amendment to the l
section which prohibits officers from re- f
ceiving pay and pensions at the same time; i
v- This after a long d-ebate was adopted, [
' c..4y?s 21, No'Cs 18, three whigs, Messrs. I <i
^GWylon, Southard and Pientiss voting I v
with the majority. Mr; Mangum then o
moved to strike out the section as amend- r
ed; this was negatived?Ayes 19, Nrtes t
23,'two whigs Messrs. Clayton and Pren- a
ti'ss vo'rtig wifh the majority... 'I'he bill t
was then postponed until Tuesday next.? 1
This debate afforded another illustration p
of the sincerity of the whig professions }
of retrenchment and reform. fi
The bill to incorporate the Banks of b
this District was taken up, the question v
being on an arnendrocnt proposed by Mr. t
Merrick, to allow them to circulate the h
paper of suspended Banks. This was t
opposed by Mr. Benton, Mr. Allen .and a
^ Mr. Linn, and supported by Messrs. Mer- v
rid; and Birrien. The Democratic Sen- k
ad verted, to the fact that a greater a
ifitgjjlkitor was passed yesterday by the ve- J
r^g?n^fmpn who were now in favor of v
a bill which would create six new tl
jPi-.-V'" oanKs with the power to issue for cirrula- s
lion the depreciated paper of suspended y
banks. Without Inking any question, the ji
^.A-a^Senate went into Executive Session and
rj^?vthen adjourned.
In the House the Tariff Bill was delta- j(

up the Bank bill, he would forbear speak* t

Washington, July 30. c
The new Tariff Bill, laying 20 per cent t
on all articls now free of duty, saving a i
free-list in fawor of manufacturers?passed \
two readings in the House, and was order- t
cd to be engrossed for a third reading.? r
It will, undoubtedly,, pass the House to- r
morrow.. This is. the bill by which the r
tax on luxuries was to "be laid, Jo supply I
the vacuum in the Treasury, occasioned I
by the Distribution Bill. Amongst those r
luxuries are Tea and Coffee, from which, j
at least, half of the duties will he raised, i
The equal advalorem principle on which j
the Bill is placed is right enough?and its i
advocates professed to keep strictly with- I
in the compromise Act. The "economi- i
cal administration" stipulated for in that <
act, is shewn in the Distribution Bill, and I c
the other projects of profuse ex-peiiditure '
?and the drain on the Treasury being ]
ust as that act requires to raise the duties ]
to supply it, is of course, also as it ought I
to be. The 20 per cent which the Bill i
?1_.. _:n. _ __.j ? .
jays on jnweiry, mim ann nue linens, is
nli a humbug. Such a duly cannot be col- i
lected; but ihen they had talked so much
about taxes on luxuries, it must be put on i
paper at least. This Bill will share the
fate of the Distribution Bill in the Senate.
If the country stands such legislation as
- this, and its other kindred measures, it is
ready for a Caesar^

tame for the bill. Sir, (said Mr. B.) I *1"

ieved the title which he hud proposed for Bu

nd that it should go forth to the world '

rotild withdraw the amendment, rather l^e

ssue one and two dollar notes. This PUI
vas strongly opposeil by the Demo- it
:ratic Senators, who alluded to the fact Mr
hat the charter of "The Regulator" gave he
t the power of issuing five dollar notes, coi
vhich would have the effect of driving ttv

unatics of the District was then taken lip, so
ind alter a determined opposition by four th<
>r five of the Democratic Senators, it was * 1
irdered to be engrosed for u third reading,
rhe bill making an appropriation for a li?
Home squadron was taken up anil after 1
i few words of explanation, was ordered Ui
lo be engrossed and subsequently it was tic
read a third time and passed, and now co
wants but the signature of the President nu
to become a law. A motion was then ?hi
made to adjourn until Monday next. Mr. tei
Clay of Alabama objected. Mr. King said tai
if the gentlemen on the opposite side of se
the House would promise not to reproach to
the Democratic Senators with delaying the trt
public business; and if they thought the ou
business could be delayed without incon- pr
venience to the suffering and agonized
people, whose cries for "action," "ac- tit
lion," we "had heardso much about, he sj)
would withdraw his'opposifion. This sal- wi
ly excited much merriment, and the pledge ki
being given, the motion was put and car- ed
ried amid roars of laughter from all sides
of the chamber.

Mr. Calhoun said he would not detain
s Senate by commeting on these Resoioos,
but he would say he coneurred
st fully in the sentiments contained in

Mr. Henderson thought that it was innbent
on those who asserted that the
nk was vhconstituiional, or who enrsed
the Sentiment, to produee some
)of to sustain the position, and chained
the production of such proof.
Mr. Clay, of Alubarna, read from the
irnal of the Convention, and the Madi1
papers* the proceedings on the mo.:
n of Robert Morris to give to Congress

Mr. Calhoun said, it was sufficieapfor I

power to incorpo:atei as it fully jusli- ,
I the assertion that .the' bill which was |

Mr. Anther said, as either himself nor ,
ccleague had been selected as the or- ,
?s on that floor of the meeting, he re- |
ded it as presumptive evidence that it
not represent the popular feeling of j
State. He said the doctrine of repeal
s but another form of Nullification, and
l Virginia repudiated alike Nulliflca*
a and Abolition.
Mr. Calhoun said, if repeal was to be
isidered Nullification,the Senator would
1 many Nulliflers around him. hide*
n'ent ot the unconstitutionality of the
nk, he asked how was it passed through
t body?- It was well known that a ma.
ily of the. Senate were opposed to the
nprnmise, or whatever it might be call*
of the Senator from Kentucky; and
en th^t.was managed by two Senators
rposely absenting' themselves, how was
passeq,.' repeated Mr. C., glancing at
. Preston! ? Under such circumstances
considered the attempt to bind this
mtry in the shackles of a Bank for
enty years, as a gross usurpation, and
nev.erin his life performed an act with
ire pleasure than he would vote for the
leal of^this bill whenever the Democrahad
thej)owerof repealing it.
Mr, Ren tun said this subject had at*'
cted some attention this morning, and

i>rVejfin$tfof & meeting in Fauquier counYigfnia,
which asserted precisely the

; would reserve this until to morrow,
that gentlemen might be prepared with

Mr. Linn offered the following resolun,
which lays over until to morrow.
Resolved, That the President of the
litcd States be requested to give the no.

| Verba relent was however a favorite expression
with the Virgins.-Senator. We
doubt whether, in the $rhole range of leu
ters, not'excepting-eiten the withering sarcasm*
of junit)s, there can be- found such
bitterness of ln?!&tiye^and.Jrepipachful
scorn as in the following wor^a. extracted
from the speech of the orat/ir ??flloarioke,
in the Senate of the United States.' '

him to the Secretarvshin of Slate.
Contempt has the property of descenv
ding but she stops far short of him- She
would die before she would reach him; he.
dwells below her fall. I would hate him
if 1 did not despise him.. It is not whit
he is, but where he is, that puts my
thoughts in action. That alphabet
which writes the name Thersitcs of black,
guard, squalidity, refuses her letters for;
him.
"That mind which thinks on what it can .
not express, can scarcely think on him.
An hyperbole for meanness would be an
eclipse for Clay."
Abstractions.?There is a great deal
said recently about "abstractions." The
word is flippantly used ! y hundreds, who
understand its meaning just about as well )
as they do the hieroglyphics on the ruined
temples of Copan and Palenque. It has
become the ruling word among the politi.
rians who go for expediency without regard
to principles. When they meet one
who refuses to join .hem in promoting men.
sures which however expedient and plausible
they may appear, are nevertheless

they at once denounce him as a visionary
and impracticable*^absiractfonist.V
Such-men are treading upon dangerous
ground? and we caution them to beware)
how they proceed. They would be horrified
at the idea of becoming "levellers"
and"disorganizers/'jret they are striking
blows in the dark which may overturn all
law, and level society and its institutions
with the dust. By denouncing whatever
stands in the way of temporary expediency
as an" abstraction," they bring into contempt
those sacred barriers of eternal
principle which have been erected to protect
the rights and liberties of all people,
whether in the majority or minority.
We admit that theories may be spun out
to a degree of fineness that will render
them useless and absurd. Some men are
very apt to indulge their minds in thus
elaborating and drawing oat a single principle
until they destroy its proper effect
by detaching it from the great and univer
6ui system 01 wnicn it is a component part.
This is an evil which should be guarded
against by all who desire to confer sub*
stantial benefits upon their race.
But this is not the greatestevil to which
a government of the people is exposed,
indeed, it is trifling compared to that
which lies at the opposite extreme, luring
us on to an abandonment of all principle."
To one who rightly views it, this danger
appears appalling?and the more so from
the fact that men are so prone to run into
it. Whilst but few will be fouud devoting
their minds to wire drawn and dreamy
speculations, nearly all will have the
vanity to believe that they can see very
clearly what is right and proper, and they
will of course think that any principle, no
matter in what form established, is very
worthless, a mere "abstraction,"provided
it stands in their way. They will, therefore,
heedlessly scramble over it; and in
this way, one by one, all these high and
holy principles to which the best blood of
America has been sacrificed, and which i
have been solemnly incorporated in our 1
constitution, will be broken down and we
shall be driven out upon the rough and ]
boisterous sea of expediency, to be tossed
about at the mercy of the winds and waves
until we are engulfed in one common ruin.
To truard us against this danger, the
mighty minds that organised our govern*
ment adopted certain fixed principles, ,
which should always control its action, and .
keep it, like the planets, in obedience to j
the laws of the solar system, revolving ,
with regularity in its proper orbit. It
may be inconvenient always to- submit to
the control of those first principles; we 1
may often find ourselves surrounded by *
circumstances which would render it very 1
expedient-for the time to have them out of <
the way. *: But shall we ever dare to violate
them? Shall we for the sake of accom* j
plishing what we may consider a tempora* J
ry good, set so dangerous an example?? :
If so, our constitution is but a rope of sand <
and the fragile chain which binds the Uft'
^ \ ; r
nioti together will be broken ioto .U? . - \
