TO PRINTERS.
E. White & Win. Hager,
RlSsPECTb UIjLY inform the Printers of the
United States, to whom they have been individually
known as established letter founders,
that they have now formed a co-partnership in
said business, and an extensive experience, Iney
hope t be able to give satisfaction to all who may
favor them with their orders
The introduction of machinery in place of the
ted/ous and unhealthy process of casting type by
h.ind, a desideratum by the European founders,
was by American ingenuity, a heavy expenditme
of time and money on the part of our senior partner,
first successfully accomplished. 1 xtensive
use of the machine-cast letter nas fully tested and
established its superiority in everv particular, over
those cast by the old process
The letter foundary business will hereafter be
carried on by the parties before named, under the
firm of While, ager V ''o. Their Specimenexhibits

T11E success of the SOUTHERN TONIC is
unprecedented. It has oeen anxiously sought
after by all persons in every part of the United
States, and its widely extended distribution has
been owing to the many requests received from
every section of tbe South and 8outh West. Although
it originated in an obscure p.irt of the country
but a few years since, it is now found in all the
principal towns and villages in tbe Union, and its
virtues as a cure for Ague and Fever, and as a
general Tonic, are appreciated by all who have
used it Being as it professes a compound of
Southern Vegetables, it is needless to oiler the as
suraiice that there is no Arsenic, Mercury, nor any

PATENT COTTON GIN. p
'BxHlSGin can be made double, or single. It ei
I made double, they reduce labor, and gin just "
louble, the quantity of cotton over the single cylin- .
ler Gin, no other knd having been in use nrevous ri
o this patent; and whether single or double, they J
ire found to improve the quality of the cotton, by
nore perfectly cleaning it. They can be made to
ontain from 20 to 160 saws in a stand, and whetlier (
mall or large, one hand will be sufficient to attend ^
liem. The Gins have mechanical feeders and
nippers attached to tliein, which free the cotton
roin leaves, trash, dirt. &.c. before it can teach the
aws, and bj the thorough hackling operation it
eceives from the feeders, which make two revo- ?
itions to one of the saws, it is almost in a half
ined state, before it descends to the saw By a
ery simple arrangement of a screw to each set ot
aates, on which the hoppers rest, and through p
rliich the teeth of the feeders pass, they can be
lade to teed slow or fast to suit the condition of
lie cotton at the time. When made double, the ..
iwb are placed on two sets of cylinders and turn
pon each other in opposite directions, and are p
leansed by two sets ot brushes that have fourrevo (
itions to one of twe saw. The two cylinders can
e detached so as to enable the planter to run one p
r botli at Dleasure. although emliriirpH tulili f" <
to. in one stand. The whole is put in operation
rith a drum and band, as in the ordinary Gin, and ,,
ray be propelled by horse, steam, or water power
t may also be propelled by iron running gear.
'he force required to work it, is about the same as
bat necessary to move on caual number of saws in
be common Gin. This Gin has been put in
pe ration in New Orleans for two or three weeks,
nd its success tested in the presence of a large
lumber of planters, merchants and others, and
eceived their general approbation.
Several gentlemen have been so kind as to give 11
he Patentee their written opinion respecting the 8e
nerits of the Gin. A number of others could be .

Dr. A. Jones?Sir, In reply to your enquiry, ari
vhall think of your improved Cotton Gin, 1 have ,
o say, that I saw it work o%.?atnrday the 25th inst.
mil was very much pleased with its performance. re
Die mere fact of its self-feeding, seems to rue to e*
>e a very valuable improvement; and besides, the df
juality of the cotton, as it comes out of the pro- n'
tess, appeared to me to be belter and cleaner than
rom the common Gins in use, and that it saves
sonsiderably in labor. Respectfully, &c.

iccoinpanied by a specimen of the cotton, ginned
>y your Patent Gin, 1 beg leave to observe, that it
exhibits a decidtd improvement on the usual process

; thereby giving the article an additional ^hlue.
These favorable impressions of the advantage cf
pur Patent Gin, have been confirmed by subsequently
witnessing it in operation. 1 he utility of
ihe double cylinders and saving of labor, will Le
eadily perceived and properly appreciated by the

. n. i d?i/rar oir, in answer ic your mquiy
of my opinion of your Patent Cotton Cin, 1
*eg leave to state, tbol I was fifteen years ergarea
in the cotton factories of Manchester, Engand,
and during four years of that time, J wr.s
breman in the house of Messrs. Lewis, Williams
fc Co., and near five years spinner in the house of
ilessrs. Sandford & Gr?enc. 1 have seen your
yotton Gin in operation, and have examined t]io
otton ginned by it, and pronounce it better cleaned,
and the staple less injured, than any cotton
hat ever come under my observation,. It is c< nidetely
rea?!y for the breaker without the aid of the
lower, and would, therefore, save the first process
n manufacturing the article. 1 consider cot ten
Icansed by your Gin, would command from one
o two cents on the pound more than the average
Tops brought into the Manchester market, and
Jeanscd by conuncn Gins. Yours, very resp'h*.

It is desirable, when planters give orders for Gins,
ey should accompany tin m with their views in
gard to the arrangement of saws, breasts, brushi,
Ac. It is found they differ in opinion. Some
'sire saws of larger diameter than others. The
ost common size is 9 or 10 inches ; but some wifh
teni 12 inches Bonn wish 5 or G rows of brushes
l an axle, while others do not want more than 4
most. Some wish saws with 8 or 9 teeth to the
ieh. while others want 10 or71. With so mutli
screpancy,we prefer they should, at the time of
ving orders, furnish a statement of their wishes,
id the inanufacturerers can fulfil them in every
irticular. Where it is left- to our discretion, we
tall make them on the most modern and approved
Ion. Am order can be executed, from the lime it
