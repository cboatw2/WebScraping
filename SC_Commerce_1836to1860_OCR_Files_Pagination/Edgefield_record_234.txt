In the louse, Mr. Adams, of Massachu
setts-asked and-obtained leave to make
the following statement,.which is deemed
here of vast importance. He stated that
he was not an abolitionist in any sense of
that term. He asserted that he had never
..been, and was not now, in favor of the- abo
Jition of slavery in the District of Columbia,
If such a bill were brought before Co -gress,
he would vote against it. He said he had
read every thingthathad been written in
favor of -the abolition of slavery in the
District by Congress, and he had maturely
weighed the subject, and the result as a
deliberate and strong conviction of its inex
itency.. He.said that he would prefer to
venthe seat of, government ebiewhere
than in a slave-holding Disirict, and, if it
was constitutional, he would remove it and
retrocede.tbe District to Maryland and Vir
ginia, but he did not think that course con
stitutional. He was, however, in favor of
referring these petitions and ofhaving a re
port upon them, and he perceived no reas
on why this subject should not be discus
sediheie as well as any ot ir.
it now appears that Mr. Adams wishes
to-have the subject referred to a Commit
tee, of which he shall he the Chairman,
and referred without limitation; and he
then wishes to present his views against
the objects of the memorialists.
January. 22.
In the Senate, to- day. the bill for the
suppression of duelling, was taken up, and
some discussion took place upon it. The
bill was finally ordered to be engrossed.
In the House of Representatives, Mr.
H.11aynes made an attem)t to procure a sus
:pension of the rules in order to go into
. Committee of the Whole on the State of
the Union, upon the President's message.
4which, at this late stage of the session, has
C not yet oeen referred to the several appro
( printe Committees. It soon became man
lifest, however, that; if the House went in
to Committee at all, they would differ very
.much as to the business first to be, taken
JUp. Some wished to take up the bill for
the relief of the persons who suffered from
French spoliations prior to 1800. and Mr,
Cambteleng gave notice that he should call
on an appropriation bill; Mr. C. remarked,
liat the only appropriation bill which had
yet passed, was the bill for the payment of
the members themselves The result was
that the House refused to go into Commit
tsee. After some unimportant business, the
Senate's bill to reduce and graduate the
price of the poblic lands was taken up and
read twice, and, the question being then
opon its reference, some members wi-ahed
to haveit referred to the Standing Comn
mittee on public lands, andi others to the
mlect 'Committee of twenty-six on the
subjectof the disposition of the public lands.
One reason given why the subject should
be referred to the Committes on flhe Public
SLanlxtsas, that they were in favor of the
proposed measure, whereas the Select
was not well disposed towards it. Mr. E w
ing reflected in a very harsh manner upon
F the Chair for organising tuch a Commit
tee on the subject of the public landR. Ue
accused him of predilection azainit the
new States in the appointment of the Com
mittee,
Mr. Wm. Cost Johnson, Chairman of
the Select Committee state.l. in substance.
that the'Committee were disposed to a.
dopt''apiidciple of graduation combined
witr distribution, and that he hoped ther
would be able to present to the House a plan
of thmis sort.which would be acceptable. It
*also appearedl in the debate, that the Corn
omittee had negatived ihe plan for distribn
tion, as proposed by M r. Clay, and that mh
gradutation plan and Mr Calhoun's project
were before them. No question was tat
ken on the motion to refer, as Mr. Mont
gomery, of N, C, anticipated that motion
.by moving that it be laid on the table. Af
*tsr a call of the House. the question wa'
taken and the motion to lay on the table
was agreed to, yeas 102, nays 97.
. Thus has this itmportant measure been
disposed of for the session. It is not sup.
posed that, whatever the Commiittee of
twenty-six shall report, there will be any
action on so important andscomplicated n
p robable that. next year. the miatter may
bsettled, It is highly important to the
.public interests, both in reference to politics
ad reeuthat it should be settled.

In the Senate to clay, Mr. NorvilT inttro
deced a bill, granting lands for the: use of
Fcolleges in the U. States. The bill was
not read. It masy be a sort of sop, cast to
the old States, atid iptended to moderate
atheir opposition to the new land p-:ojects.
Mr. Tallmadge brought foraird a-new
Enancial project of great importance, in the
ghap: faieof-reso~'utions, - as follows;
...-'.eolmed, That a number of sound spe
. oie paying banks ought to be selected, un
-der suitable regulations, for safely keeping -
the public money."
- -Resolved, That paymnent of public mon
cyotught to be made in gold and silver, or
in notes of sound specie paying"'banks. un
der suitable regulations, to be proscribed
by law. --
Resolued, That the selectiid banks, in
~consideration of such deposites, ought to
pseuform 'without charge, 'he same duties,
tor vernment ingtransferring the pub
lic odseand distrib,ujing the same in pay
tuent of tfie public creditors, as were per
formed by the late, Bank of the, L. States.
Tlie-resolutions were ordered to be prin

The bill to aliolishm imprisonment for
debt, in certain cs, and the hill to sup
press dumellinigit tDistrict of Columbia,
were read a ii~'ime and passed.
The;Senae'at an early hour, went into
ani Exefttise session.
* -Tle.Htuse had, to-day. another battle
tapoilthe graduatitiont bill. Mr. Ptriken
r noved that the vote by which the bill was
laid on the table, ho reconsidered--and Mr.
Williams, of N. C. moved to lay this mao
tion on -the table, which was rejected
yeas 96,:nays 102. The motion to recon
sider was lost, by the very close vote of 98
to'99 . --
If the House had ever gone into-this sab
Joet, i wotnid have al' the next six
weeks, just as the lnvestigauon queston
oectipied tfie last seven weeks. W ienev
er this subject, which is of so much sec
tional interest, shall - coae. before the
House, every member must be heard up
on-it.
Another ineffectual attempt was made
to-day to go into Committee of the Whole
on the State of the Union, in order to ,ake
up the President's message. The House is
afraid that the debate onl the message will
tie continued, as it probably would be,
should they get into Committee.
Mr. Bronson, from the Committee on
Territories, reported a bill to authorise the
people of Iowa to form a Constitution and
State Government. So, we have three
new States knocking at our door. Flori
da, it is true, yet wants the requisite num
ber of inhabitant, but Col. Benton's occu
pation bill will soon give them to her.
The House adjourned early, being with
out a quorum. We have no news here.
out of Congress. There was a rumor that
a Minister Extraordinary is to be sent to
Turkey, but it has died away.
January 24.
In the Senate, Mr. Benton brought for
ward his bill for the abo!ition of the duty
onl Salt. and the fishitng bounties. ad
made a long speech in favor of the meas
ure, relying very much for his facts and
views upon certain documents, communi
cated some years ago to the British House
of Commons. The duty, though small,
throws the imported Salt, into the hands
of monopoliets, according to Mr. Benton's
idea, and greatly enhances its price. Mr.
Davis, who represents the Salt-making
and Fishing country, stated that he should
reply to Mr. Benton's views, when the
subject was next taken up.
MrN Wright gave notice that he should
to-morrow call up the-report of the Secre
tary of the Treasury, in relation to the sale
and-payment of the U. S. Bank bnds,
when he will reply to the remarks of Mr.
Rives, and Mr. Rivet is expected to reply.
There is nothing of much interest now
before Congress. We are all waiting the
return of the investigating Committee, for
that is the chief business of this session.
In the House, Mr. Cambreleng made a
report on the state of the Treasury. As
was expected, he cries out for retrench
ment and economy. as well he may, for
without them, the Exchequer will be soon
very low. He says, if Congress pass the
Harbor and Fortification bills, as reported,
we must get five or six millions from some
source or other to meet the expenditur
we shall fill short by that amount. There
will, therefore, as you may suppose, be a
hot battle when the appropriation bills
come up for discussion.
The House went into Committee of the
Whole, on the State of the Union, (Mr.
Adams in the Chair,) and took up the Pre
sident's Message. Mr. Everett, of Ver
mont, took the floor, and spoke some hours
against that part of the message which re
lates to Indian affairs. Mr. Everett went
into a review of our Indian policy,.- to
which he has always been hostile. Mr.
Masou, of Ohio, also passed some strictures
upon other parts of the message. Mr.
Crary, of Michigan, opposed the views
taken sometime ago by Mr. Bell, on the
general tone of the message, and support
ed the general policy of the Administra
lion. Before Mr. C. concluded, the Cont
mit tee rose, and he will probably resume
his speech to-morrow.

.DRiY- DOCKS.tl.:
JA. to, 1889.
Mr. Pickens rose and said, that.aswhen
up before, he sustained this appropriatin
in the original bill of $J00,000 for a dry
dock at New York, he now felt, from the
range of discussion, disposed to nake a
few mnore remarks in addition to what he
had already said. He would first notice
what had fallen from the gentleman from
Penusy Ivania, [,Mr Petrikin.] That gen
tietman had given us a very good lecture
on economy and Democratic principles,
and had thought proper to extend a portion
of it to him LMr. Pickens.] He was sur
prised to find gentlemen from the South,
that had heretofore been good economists,
ranged in support of this appropriation!!
All this was good doctrineand Mr. Pickens
only regretted that the gentleman's prac
tice had no. entirely corresponded. with his
precept. He, [Mr.- Pickens.] had taken
that geutlenan last session as his file lead
er on economy. The gentlemen had even
set his cue to the tudie of 'economy, that we
imight follow in his wake; but, sir, when
we come to voting appropriations for the
Cumberand road, what was my astonish
ment when I found my file leader, wheel
ing to the righr about, and voting aye!
And is this the gentleman to rise here now,
and read me a lecture on economy, be
cause I choose to support an appropriation
of $100.000 ,- for a branch of your naval
service, while he supported an appropria
tion of near a million for the Cumberland
road ?
I will not condescend to institute a com
parison between the two objects. Sir,.!
glory in supporting liberal appropriations
for'every thing connected with yotw navy.
It is the only safe and efficient nrm of na
tional defence in a free republic; and some
of the -very gentlemen who will now vote
against this appropriatio%. you will find,
at the close of the session, voting what
they have hereby saved, ani millions
more, to dig out harbors upon your inland
seas, where God and nature never intend
ed that any shoubl oe. Manygentlemen who
will now vote dow u such appropriations
as the present, will combine hereafter itn a
schene of legislation under appropriations
for your Cumberland road, your light
house and harbor bills, and your other
thousand mi-erable local appropriations,
by which private speculators have been
enabled to swindle the country out of alil
liotns of dollars. and yet all this is sound
economy!
The true and only questions. before the
committee are, is a dry dock ueeded at
New York, and is this appropriation fit
and proper? Upon these points there is a
ioneurrence of sentiments in those *ho
baire considered the matter. Where can
iuch an establishment, with more propri
sty be located than New York, the centre
cf commerce and navigatioti, and not
withstanding all her sins, in a commercial
point of view, the pride of the Republic?
We now lose, for want of a dry dock at
tbat point, in two years. by the decay and
injury of our vessels of war, more than
would be re(iired to construct the dock.
Fron the extreme Northern point on the
:oast or Maine to Cape Cod, from Cape
Cod to Cape Hatteras, and from Cape
Hatteras to Cape Florida, and from thence
o the Sabine, by examination of the map
you will find between each of these promt
men point., great bayn or identures-in the
-oust of the United States; and there
)ught to be in the centre of each. navy
yards on the m)4t liberal and substantial
)asts--one at Boston, one at New York.
me at Charleston, and one at Pensacola.
4V ith mnore than two thousand miles of sea
oast, aend a comparattiv'ely sparse popu
ation, it is vatn and idle to think of ainy
ither elficieut system of fortification or na
'ional defenice exept by a navy. In the
text great confliet, youm landl fortifications,
rhich have been copicd frtom the F'renceh
ystem, will be as impotent and .useless
except at isolated points) as are the cas
Jes in ruins that now frown over Enrope,
ransmitting to us nothing but the recollec
ion of the barbarian nobility who once iii
t abited them. No, sir; if war does come,
which may God in his mercy avert!) it
vill be upon watgr, the fate of empire will
we decided. Your armies upon land will
ec of little or no s-ervice. Under the creat
hauges in modern times, the true system
f defence and powr,is to take advantage
fall the inventions and improvements
particularly in steam) of the day, and give
uch eticency to your navy as willrnable
is to meet any contingentcy that may arise.
confess tha. I ant proutd of being the stup
imrter oif that glorious and nobmle armn of
>nr national defence. It has hortne our
tars and our stripe's in hoinor to the most
listant seas of the habitable globe: and the
otaries of freedom int every land have
seen cheered l-y the broad folds of our na
ional banner, as it has swept along the
emnotest coast of thts earth.
But, sir, ii has been said-that appropria
ions on this subject have heretofore been
Qetional; th'at, while we have not re
etved our share,others have received more
han their share. Sir, to a certain extent
his has been true;, but I contehd that ex
cenditures on this branch, more than every
hing conected with Governmenit, have
hed.a common benefit and a common
leasing upon our united country. What
an protect the immense productions of the
south, floatinig over every sea to foreign
ands,- as they do, buit a vigilant andi eff.
ient navy? If thbe ships are made at the
qorth,and manned by Nort hern men, (but
ye have our full proportion of officers,) yet
I they protect and defend our rtch pro
Ilutions from the plunder and oppression
f foreign powers, we have a deep stake
a supporting them. It is the only branch
cf public defence and putiem expenditure
a which we have a peculiar and deep in
erest. Andi allow me to say, that this is
to time for a representative froian At
antic or Gulf State to hesitatein voting
ppropriations that mnay be proper to put
ur navy in spanking order. Lnok at the
uovements of the French in the Gulf and
n the coast of Mexico. Without pretend
gto censure them, or'at present to ques
on their rights, yet I wvill say that their,
osition uiponi a defenceless coast, and a
riongst rich and defenceles, islands, is
empting to their power, and iftthey with.
itad it they have less amnbition. than. the
rorld attributes to them. Sir, what I
3can to inasinuar is, that in the progress of
vents such a point may be occuipieni, an'd
un a positian amanmaed. that tha inde
peadence of our commirc from the Mis
sisippi.valley, and througft-he Itulfmay

The independence of ten of the richest

propriations for any thing connected with
your navy? Sir, I alhor t hat cruel econo
my, which,to save a few thousaud dollars
now would sacrifice the blood of freemen
hereafter.
leaw in fayor.toOthe appropriation for
Pensacola, too. because I believe eficient
protection and support to our navy on that
extensive -coast, its remote- position, and
the sparse population. bordering,,on the
Gulf of Mexico, all demanud from this Ghov
eminent its guardian care and military
protection. I believe, also, that all the
States in the valley of the Mississippi and
the Ohio, are deeply iuserested in sustain
ing the.power and efficiencyof our navy in
the Gulf, particularly at this ju'ncture of
af'airs in that quarter. I go for appropria
tions of this kind; not because they may be
of local benefit to this section or to that
section, but because of their common ben
efit to mrycommOn country. True our
finances'may be low, anti lot us go for anr
eilightened retrenchment and economy.
Yes, sir, strike at your light houses and
harbor bills-your Cumberland road hill
-your new fortification bills-and all such
like loose and unnecessary appropriations.
gut in God's name do not strike at the
navy, the pride and the ornament of the
country; and particularly at this period of
the world, when every other maritime
power seems to be concentrating their na
tional energies upon that arni of defence.
Mark the progress of these things, and I
predict, when you refuse such appropria
lions as this, that in the last three days of
this very session, the 16th joint rule of this
louse will be suspended, in order to let in
bills embracing all kinds of a ppropriations
which singly and alone, upon their own
independent merita, could never receive
the sanction of the tnajority of this House,
upon fnll or fair discussion.
I will here say that I cannot agree to
the propostion, or as it has been called a
bargaiti, proposed by the gentleman from
New York, (Mr. Hoffinan,) -in relation to
the Philadelphia dock. It is due to can
dor to say that I am opposed to that a
mendment. I do not think it at all need- I
ed. if the one at New York is established.
The sentiments I have now avowed are
the same I 'have uttered here before, four
years since. I am opponed, generally, to
appropriations upon land, or for land ser
vice, but in favor of strengthening our na
tional defence upon water.
Mr. Petrikin rose amidst cries of ques
tion,. question. The gentleman from S.
Carolina said he had voted for the Cum
herland road. It was true that he had,
and he believed, at the time, it was right,
and that he was voting for the general
good. He had done it partly on grounds
of expediency. because the Government
was under a pledge: but he found he had
been deceived. He had been in the wrong;
he had founl this out in a very few days
after his vote was given, but if God and
his constituents would forgive him for this
once, he never would vote another dollar
in the sdme way as long as he lived.

which, under the. rules, lie over one day:

BATTLE OF THE GOW-PENS2
The 58th anniversary of the Battle of
theCow- Pens was celebrated, on the ground
on the I7th'inst., with great spirit and ani
mation. The citizens of the..immediate
vicinity attended generally, and a number
of respectable. persous from adjoining dis
tricts, both of Suuth..and North Carolina,
were also present, and -sealously disposed
to do honors to theday. Of.,tbcp original
actors in the scene, mt 1781, hut-tico could
be nrabered in thetcomnpany! -Maj Sam
uel Mc. Junkin, of Union, and Capt. Johan
Collins, of-Spartanburgh Districts, both; of
whom were engaged in th'e battle; and it
would seem, that the genius of the place
had purposely reserved- these two venera
ble patriots-the last of their brave* band,
to receive the homage of a grateftil couti
try. so richly due to them, andto the memt
ory of their departed companions in arms!
Several Military Companies attended,
"armed and-equipped,'- anti were thrownt
into a handsome Battalion under the corn
mnd of Col. A. C. Bomar, as Marshal of
the day; and which, after performing sev
eral spirited evolutions, mopved, in conntex
