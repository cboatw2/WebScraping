? As the culture of silk excites a great ,
deal of interest at this time in the United ,
Siates, (and deservedly too I think) I will !
state seme facts in relation to the cultivation
of the Morus Muiticaulis in this vicinity,
which have come under my knowledge? j
Last year in May, I set out about 35 cut- .
tings from the M. Muiticaulis in my garden, j
30 of which lived, and many of them grew j
to the height of 12 feet during the summcr?In
March, thi* year, I took 500 cuttings
from them, which I set out in a field
which is scarcely fertile enough for corn,
and the most of them is growing luxuriously
; in fact, out of the 500 aboye mentioned,
and 6000 additional cut;ings of the
JU. M. which I procured from Col. Ciies- '
tcr Root, of Mobile, and set out in the same (
field in the months of February and March
of this year, not more than 150 have died.
The land contained in the field mentioned, *
may be termed the better sort of pine barrens
; it wqs (as it is here called) cow-pen- !
ned year before last; previous to which 1
time it had laid fallow /or a number of J
years. In setting out the cuttings, I used 1
no manure, but prepared the beds well by }
pulverizing the earth. 1
" One of my neighbors set out 400 cut- [
tings in February this year, in the most ordinary
pine barren land, which has,howev- :
cr, been in cultivation for a number of :
' rx r ? ?
years, and all but about 4iJ 01 mum uru =
now growing finely. He used manure in 1
setting out the cuttings, but the land is nothing
but a bed of sand, with very little admixture
of clay; in fact he made the sc.
lection of land with the view of trying the j
experiment whether the M. Multicaulis can
be cultivated on the ordinary pine lands or ?
not. So far, the experiment has succeeded, j
but it is not time yet to judge of its ultimate
success."

MAKING GARDEN.
It may be too late to say much about t
the laying out and preparing a garden for t
culture : but vet we think a few remarks t
' J
on this subject may be beneficial to some t
notwithstanding. 1
Method in making garden, should be i
observed as much as in framing a house. 1
A garden laid out regularly and plan ted <
methodically, not only looks better, but is
more easily tended and more profitable. ;
How* common it is, in this country, to sec ;
a little patch of ground scratched up and i
a few seeds scattered upon it without any
regular ty, and then left the rest of the sea- ,
son to contend with weeds and grass, and if i
the plants should be fortunate enough to <
gain the mas'ery, the proprietor congrutu- j
iates himsel in having a jine garden. In .
such gardens, a person may see a few <
plants of red-headed lettuce, as tough as a blacksmith's
apron?a few, bitter, crooked ]
cucumbers, and a few hills of beans, which ;
look as though they had the ague. How ,
different the garden of the man who goes (
to work in it as if he meant to make it pro- (
fitable. In the fall, or early in the spring,
he spreads a good coat of manure on his
garden?ploughs it deep and fine?then
divides it into squares of ten feet square,
making a sufficiently wide alley between
the several squares by throwingjup the ?arth
on to them, then with a garden rake, makes
the earth fine and mellow ; lie then divides
these squares rrrto Wde of foot u/ide,
with a little Dath between them, and sows
his seeds in drills at the proper time.?
When weeds or grass show themselves,
they are immediately exterminated, and the
earth kept loose around the plants, which
% are thincd out to the proper number. This
with a little care, a garden may be made
the most profitable part of a farm
Cooking Potatoes.?This is no inconsid.
crable art; and 1 have some suspicion that
Cobbetl's ignorance of the best way of do.
ing this, may have been one reason of his
antipathy to the use of this esculent. The
direct.on given by one writer is, never to
put your potatoes into cold, but boiling water
; and keep it boiling until the potatoes
are done or sufficiently boiled; then pour
off the water us soon as possible : if a little
salt be thrown into the water when boiling,
the better." We will add a better mode
than this, which has been so thoroughly and
successfully tested, that we believe it cannot
fail to "be approved : Select the potatoes
you design for dinner the day previous;
pare them and throw them into cold water,
and let them stand three or four hours;
then, at a proper time before dinner, put
them into boiling water; and wnen they
are sufficiently boiled, turn of ail the water,
leave off the cover, and hang them over
the fire to dry. When the steam has pas- J
scd off they will then be in the best possible
v
condition for eating. By this mode, pota.
toes even of a watery and inferior qua iity,
become mealy and good. H. C.
From tho New York Observer.
TEMPERANCE IN THE SPANIARDS.
Cold water is another commodity carried
about the streets both summer and
winter. Cold water, and nothing to mingle
with it?strange as it may seem to the
palates whose unfortunate owners can
scarce remember the time since childhood
when they have known from experience
how it tastes undiluted?pure could water
forms one of the most customary and profitable
"cries" of the towns and cities of all
Spain. It is carried about in large vases
of porous clay, or w heeled round in portable
fountains, with large glass goblets, for
the refreshment of the purchaser. I have
seen a gentleman stop one of these water
carriers, and drink a sparkling tumbler of
the pure beverage, in the open street, with
as much apparent pleasure as any red-nosed
gentlemen of the bar" in our country
vould exhibit in quaffing a bottle of poisoned
champagne, or Copenhagen porter,
[tiding the other day into the country wc
jtopped for a moment at the door of a
;mall ventorillo, or inn. by the way-side,
ind were not a little pleased at the evilent
enjoyment with which the coachman
oaid for a drink of cold water, which was
landed to him in a mug from a.vase near
it hand, replenished for the purpose. As
t was just after breakfast, 1 could not tell
tow he could possibly be thirsty enough
o drink it, but it ujs an additional proof
)f ail that I have heard as to the waterIrinking
propensities of the Spanish peasintry.
Little huts of water-stands, by the
oad-sidc are not unfrequent in every di ection,
for the supply of water for the
>assing peasantry and travelers.
The Spaniards have a proverb, that
'drinkinp water neither makes a Jnan sick.
? n
wr in debt, nor his wife a widow.'* It deserves
to be noted "with a white stone,"
tnd I wish it were written in letters of gold
)ver the door of every inn by the road-side
n our country. It would make a happy
notto for the banner of the New York
state Temperance Society. What a
vorld of misery would have been saved,
md what a multitude of wretched families
vould have been made happy, by its timey
romcmberance. Drinking water
*?cither makes a man sick, nor in debt,
*tok his wife a widow. It is surely a
jood proverb and a happy one for the
lation, whose habits make it theirs.

tiic Island of Cuba.?We have transated
the following extract from the speech
if the deputy Sancho, in the Cortes ol
Spain, delivered on the first of April last.
.i discloses the views of the Spanish Government
in relation to this island, which is
>f so much commercial importance, not
inly to Spain, but the United States.?
riie debate came up under a proposition
o give representation to Cuba in the Cor
:es. The attention of the Government ot
lie United States was early attracted to
his island, which could not remain indifferent
to its political condition, considerng
its geographic position, and particularv
its social institutions, which are analogv
O
ws to those of our Southern Stales.?
The portion of our confederacy, as well
is the Republic of Texas, must ever have
t deep interest in the question of slavery
in Cuba.
"If, gentlemen, the island of Cuba should
:easc to be Spanish, it must belong to the
negro. It cannot come under the power
)f any other nation, because, fi-stly, there
is no nation powerful enough to subjugate
100,000 negroes, who, under the tropics,
shall say, 4we will not be governed by
you.' Secondly, because, if another nation
should attempt to take possession of
it, some rival power would oppose the dehorn.
In strict truth, and without figure
--0? ? , w,
of speech, the island of Cuba is the key
of the Gulf of Mexico, and no other than
a great martimc power could take possession
of it. And what power would consent
to such possession?
"Let us state the question as between
England aad the United States, since the
former holds the sceptre of the seas,
and the other is maratimc power in the
neighborhood of the island.
"Could rtie United Slates consent that
England should own the island of Cuba?
In addition to the fact that Cuba is the
key of the Gulf of Mexico, we must keep
in mind one other important circumstance.
It is well known that the coast of America,
in that quarter, has but very few ports.?
The island of Cuba, on the countrary.
may bo said to be one whole port, it has
thirty four good harbors, and of these, fifteen
are capable of containing large squadrons.
This is a sufficient consideration
to prevent it from falling into the hands
of a muratime power. Besides this advantage,
there is this, that Cuba furnishes
ship timber for any quantity of vessels.
"Would England allow the United
States to take possession of Cuba? England,
as the mistress of Gibraltar, has divided
the forces of Spain and France; as
mistress of the Ionian isles, she eommands
the Adriatic; and with the Cape of Good
Hope, she holds the key of India. Would
she, then, permit Cuba to be held by a
third power?
"Long and protracted wars with greal
effusion of blood, must happen before this
could take place. The United States
would not consent to this change of masters
so soon as Great Britain. We al
know that the rivers emptying in the Gul
of Mexico flow from the mountains' of the
I . S. In thcirvolloys isgrowmgan immense
. population. AH the productions of those
, countries have their dcbouchc at IS'ew Orleans,
which is the principle part of commerce
on the Gulf of Mexico. If the
United States should consent to the occupation
of Cuba by Great Britain, it would
i be as if a merchant should send the key
of his money chest to another person, and
say, 'you are the master of that chest.*
"There is no alternative, gentlemen;
the island of Cuba must remain under
Spanish protection, or it must be abandoned
to itself. If left to itself, it must become
a negro government. The effemiuate
and enervated whites would not be
able to oppose the negro population in
that burning climate.
"It may be said that the whites possess
wealth and knowledge. They possessed
them also in St. Domingo. But of what avail
are wealth and knowledge, when opposed
to brutal force; when the question is one
of exposure to the elements, of bearing fatigue,
to which the slave is accustomed,
and suffering the heat of the sun, of which
the negro declares himself to be the child?
What would be the result? The whites
would be subdued, as they were exterminated
in St. Domingo,"
WHAT YOUNG LADIES CAN DO.
"Why did you not take the. arm of my
brother last night?" said a young lady to
her friend, a very intelligent girl, about 19,
in a large town near Lake Ontario. She
replied,4 Because I knew him to be a li.
centious man." "Nonsense," was the
answer of the sister, "if you refuse the
attentions of licentious men, you will have
none, I can assure you." "Very well,"
said her friend, "then 1 can dispense with
them altogether?for my resolution on this
point is unalterably fixed." How long
would it take to revolutionize society,
were all young ladies to adopt this resolution??Apv.
of Moral Reform.
Another Fact.?A clergyman lately delivered
a moral reform lecture, in the towu
of L. in the western part of the State.
Among his hearers was a young lady of
the first respectability, who had been attended
there by a young law student, a
graduate of a New England College, and
one who stood well in society, though
known to be a libertine. The subject of
associating with the licentious man was
brought forward with such power and clearness
by the speaker, as to send conviction
to her heart. She turned to a friend who
sat near her, and said, ''What shall I do?
C. is in the house, and I ought not to speak
to him again." She was answered, "you
must be firm and act according to your
| views of duty." "I will do it" said the
I rotmir lnrlv nnd :irrr?rdinrlV when the
| jrwf'D j j 0 j
j gentleman came to her and made some
remark, she turned her back and took no
noiicc of him. At the close of the lecture,
she knew his attention would be again offercd;
but her resolution was taken, and
she placed herself between her father,
who was the chairman of the meeting, and
her mother, and returned with them, leav.
ing the mortified libertine to reflect at
his leisure on the cause of her neglect.?
lb.
Another.?Not long since, the husband
of a lady in one of thewesrern towns in this
State, invited a gentleman to dine with him,
whose character as a libertine was publicly
known. The lady was a friend of moral
reform, and moreover possessed so much
independence of thought and feeling, that
i she was not afraid to follow the dictates of
conscience. Accordingly, she maintained
a profound silence to her unwelcome
guest, not even answering the questions he
addressed to her. During dinner, she was
polite in her attention, but spake not one
word to him, and as soon as possible left
the table. He complained bitterly to the
husband of this conduct, and said he never
received such treatment in his life. "What
can be the matter with your wife? She has
not spoken to me since I come into the
house*" The husband professed ignor.
auce of the cause, and when his friend was
gone, inquired of his wife the reasons for
her singular treatment of his guest. She
replied, "You know very well that he is a
licentious man. If you choose to invite
such men to your house, I cannot help it.
It is not in my power to refuse therr. admittance,
but my tongue is my own, and I will
never speak to a man of this character who
is brought as a guest to my table. If I
cannot turn them from the house, I can at
least refuse to acknowledge thetr presence
bv one look or word, and this I will certain,
ly do."
Did the noble stand taken by this lady,
think you, lower her in the estimation of her
husband, or even in that of his profligate
companion? No no; even the wicked are
awed by the majesty of virtue, and it will
command their involuntary respect and admiration.
We have often said, and we repeat
it, that we do not wish the youg gossiping
or suspicious. It is only in cases
where the character is known to be bad,
that we wish them to act upon this knowi1
edge, just as they would if the offender
were a woman instead of a man. We
blush for the degradation of human nature,
when we find it necessary to caution wamen
against smiling on the guilty seducer,
1 while she spurns the poor fallen sister
; whom his aits have destroyed. How difI
ferently do we judge in these matters from
I the blessed Saviour! He sent away the
i trembling, condemed culprit from hissacred
presence with a kind, yet solemn admotii1
tion, while his searching words had long
; before scattered her proud accusers, under
5 the consciousness that their very hearts,
with all their abominable impurity, were
1 naked and open in his sight. His hoiy
f soul hated the crime?hence he judged of
; the criminals only by their relative guilt;
? while we, professing to he his followers,
i and to have his spirit, brand one, and that
one, the weak and helpless female, with in
famy, while we take the other to our
> hearts and homes as a safe and desirable
> inmate. We call 011 professors of religion
I to make the Bible the rule of their con'
duct in this, as well as in other respects,
[ and to look upon sin as God looks upon it,
prgive up at once and forever, alll pretenlion
to the Christian name. If we have
trne delicacy and purity of soul we shall
shrink from the scorching breath of
the pestilence, and until we do this, how.
ever loud may be our pretensions the "root
of the matter is not in us."? lb.
A young lady who encourages the attention
of a man known to be of lose habits, may be
virtuous from regard to character, but not
firom principle or hatred of vice. The same
iiay be said of a woman who consents to
marry a "reformed rake."

A PR A It IE ON FIRE!
r About an liocr before sun-set we spied a
cloud of vapor in the direction we wore
travelling, rising gradually from the earth,
and spreading itself to the right and left as
far as the eye coald seach.
It resembled at first a fog I had seen rise
from that great waste, the Pontine marshes,
aril pass off over the Mediterranean in
light collumns of a feathery form, until it
was lest in higher altitude of light. After
a half lour's progress it acquired a greater
density and, like a London smoke, extend,
ed itself over the whole heavens. Suddenly
the sin, which had partially illuminated
me sky. sunk below the horizon over the
rolling prairie country, in which we were
I ir*i7oinfr nnrl .ill the lifrlif became instan
I ""**"*'?> ? - ?--- >
taneously transferred to the east, in those
clouds which became brighter, and were
driving before the wind towards us.
Until then 1 had regarded it as a phenomenon
of the atmosphere; but the glare of
light increased fast, and the air became
heated aijd suffocating, as the wind bore it
directly upon us. The Indians who were
far in advance, fell back and announced the
prairie on fire, and that it was fast approachng
ns. At first there was a general conis
crnation among the whole party. I was
alarmed, and demanded through a half,
breed, who spoke a few words of Canadian
Frenci, what was to be done.
Our pioneer, the old chief " Whirling
Thunder.," gave instant orders for the
whole party to form a line, which every one
obeyed, galloping away to the right and left,
and dismounting some ten or fifteen rods
depart. In five minutes every one had
struct a fire, and applied a torch to the tall
dry grass of of the prairie, which was soon
bore before the wind with terrific fury, in
the direction we had come from, snapping
aad flying into the air like small rockets.
The glare and heat of the first advancing
ii the other direction increased every moment;
our horses became restive, snorting,
and exhibiting the greatest terror, as it came
cracking and streaming in the air before the
wind, which had increased to a perfect
hurricane.
At this moment the fire we had kindled
advanced slowly against the wind, and from
which we were retreating to avoid the flames
nnH heat. The nrairie over which it had
.. _ r passed,
being but a sheet oi' flames, gradually
diminished, however, in brightness.
Here we were between two fires, and both
advancing towards us, though that against
the wind was slower and less intense, but
both extended to tho right and left to an
immense distance. The one before the
wind we since ascertained to have been
about forty-two miles wide, and to have run
a distance of one hundred and seventy
miles, crossing the streams by the force of
the wind.
This scene, in connection with the perilous
situation in which we were placed, was
grand bevond the power of description.
Thousands of builalo, deer, and wild fowl,
were bounding and flying in every direction
around us, which, added to the noise of the
elements, sounded like the clashing encounter
of hostile armies. I have stood within
the convulsed crater of Vesuvius during a
night eruption, and seen a thousand travellers
and visitors flying with lighted torches
gleaming in the distance, before the fiery
waves of a torrent of lava. I have seen the
deep flood ol the Niagara leap from its
rocky height into the foaming abyss below;
and the rushing avalanche tumfllc from the
glaciers of the Alps, carrying desolation
to the inhabitants of the vaney"
llliU ....
below ; but to witness a vast prairie in the
far, far west, on fire is a scene more grand
and thrilling.
'Tis vain to draw a picture of this night
in the prairie, when eard) and air were one
complete blaze of light?a perfect whirlwind
of fire and flames,and the wild beasts were
driven cn masse1 from their hiding-places.
The heat becoming intense, the old chief
gave the signal for retreat hv a wild whoop,
which was echoed by the whole of the Indi
ns, though half lost amid the noise of the
elements. It was instantly obeyed by all,
forcing with much difficulty our horses
through the conflagration we had kindled,
and continuing to ride for about three miles
at full speed, until we reached a high ridge
where the grass had been light, and was
soon consumed.?Pliila? U. S. Gazette.
From Zion's WatchmanPHRENOLOGY.
Many of our readers, no doubt, remeni.
ber the thrill of horror that ran through
(' this section of country, occasioned by the
' murder of Judge Sayre, and his wife, and
> servant maid, in Morrisiown, N. J., a few
: years ago, by a Frenchman named Lef
' Blanc.
f Well, Dr. A. C. Dayton, a short time
I since, submitted the scull of Lef Blanc, to
. the examination of three practical pbrenol.
ogists of this city, under the following circumstances:
It was first shown to Messrs. Fowler and
Brevoort, 155 Clinton Hall, and they gave
the following written description of the
character, without the least knowledge of
the individual, as the testimony of witnesses
who were present will show :
MESSRS. FOWLER AND BREEVOORTS
DESCRIPTION.
1st. A male. 2d. A thief, and would
murder for money; very adroit, cunning,
evasive, deceptive, sly, mysterious, selfish ; :
with intellect enough to manage most a- |
droitly; seductive, if not licentious; com- t
paritively destitute of moral principle, and !
yet, perhaps, made great pretentions to re- ligion;
unsocial; a friend to no one; 1
quaiTfiMjmf ; posscubcu ui a viuium icmper,
especially when he thought himself 1
imposed upon, and under the dominion of ?
the animal and selfish passions. A snake 1
in the grass ; would take vengeance in the
dark. Careful, cautious, wary, haughty; i
resent an insult very quickly; hypocritical; '
and probably a Roman Catholic and very 1
supersticious. . j
Fowler & Breevoort. '
The following testimony may be relied
on. Mr. Walter, we believe, is a Clergy- *
man: , 1
The above is a written description of the 1
skull of Antonio Lef Blanc, the murderer J
of Judge Sayre and family in the village J
of Morristown, N. J. The scull was sub- 1
mitted by me to 0. S. Fowler and Bre- 1
voort, with a request that they would make (
a statement of character. They gave the
nhnvo without the least intimation nr anv
? e ; ?j (
possible means of information with refer. .
ence to the individual j they could have
known nothing about it beforehand, and j
their statement was made without the least
equivocation or hesitation. j
The character of the person is notorious;
and from the acquaintance I had with ^
it, I can testify, and am confident that every j
person who had an opportunity to know
that the man will agree with me that it cor- .
responds even to the mmutia with his most
striking peculiarties. A greater master
of vice and depravity?a more artful treacherous
'and violent wretch cannot well be
imagined. In his confessiens, he expres.
i ?I '
btru gruiu uiai uif juuug lauic^, inc
daughters of Mr. S. were not at home, that
he might murder them also, for he wanted
their gold watches.
A. C. Dayton, M. D.
We the undersigned were present when
the above scull was submitted to Fowler
and Brevoort, for examination, and testify
to the examination corresponding in every
point to the development afterwards made
by the gentleman who submitted the scull
for examination.

Clinton Hall, 155 Nassau St. i (
Mr. L. N. FOWLER's DESCRIPTION.1 <
The following description of the same 1
head, was given by a brother of the Mr. *
Fowler first named, of the firm of Barlow, *
Howe, and Fowler, 286 Broadway. It y
was given in the presence of Dr. Dayton,
Rev. Isaac N. Walter, J. J. Harvey, and
Mr. John Church, after the examination
above described, and without the slightest 1
knowledge or suspicion either of the object, <
or the previous examination had upon it.
The temperature of this man was hiJ. f
lious and nervous. He had a strong constitution,
with great energy warm, active
passions, and violent feelings. The occi- t
pital is larger than the frontal region, giv.
ing the predominance of passion and of the i
lower feelings, not having sufficient intellect
and moral feeling to control the propensi- j
ties. The largest organs in his head are
secrelivenesss, acquisitiveness, destructive. ?
ness} and compativenessy and self-esteem,
which would have inclined him to cunning,
duplicity, deceptions, selfishness with an j
unconquerable desire to accumulate, pos-1 ]
sess, aes:roy, uouiiiia-r, auu ruic. un ^
secreliveness and acquisitiveness are the j
largest the writer ever saw ; it is decidedly
the worst head lie ever saw. He would |
have been dictatoral, arbitrary, and regard,
less of public opinion. Approbbativeness
being moderate, and self-esteem large, he s
would have been regardless of others, and
selfish and depraved in the highest degree.
There would have been no crime too hein- .
ous for him to commit, when irritated or -1
jealous. Benevolence, when compared
with the passions, is moderate ; yet not sufuliung
tT7 !mtv u ^unli ulling,?'
influence on the mind. Having very large \
secretiveness w'ith very strong passions; he
would have been likely to make religion a
cloak for his crimes. His attachments and
social feelings are strong; yet his selfish J
emotions, and particularly his Jove ot gain, '
is much stronger ; so that he would read- '
ily sacrifice friends for selfish enjoyment; 1
lie must have been a great intriguer, and '
well calculated to plot and conceal his in- 1
tentions from observation. He was natu- 1
rally suspicious, and always on the alert '
as to the movements of others. Having 1
imitation and secretiveness marked, would <
readily have accommodated himself to oth- '
ers, and could easily have passed for whom <
and for what he choose. He had good I
mechanical talent, and mechanical judge- i
ment. He was very observing, and had I
good practical talents; yet he had not a I
strong mind. He was shrewd, and knew I
how to avail himself of circumstances. '
Yet he had more tact than judgment. i

Snake Fight?Staring Adventure.?On
Sunday last Afr. John Foster, who resides
near the Washington Print Works, in this
town, discovered near his house a large
black snak": he seized a billet of wood and
pursued him some twenty yards, to near a
small tree, when the serpent turned, raised
himsef in an upright position, and prepared
to act upon the defensive. He threw the
billet of wood but missed him, wherepon
his snakeship came at him full tilt, his
mouth throwu open and with his firery
eyes and forked tongue exhibiting all the
venom of his species. Mr F. seized a
small stick and as he came up made a
pass at him but he dodged it and gave back.
This was repeated several times, the snake
all the time keeping his eye steadily and
piercingly fixed upon that of Mr. F. After
some two minutes spent in this way the
snake suddenly vanished, "and," say Mr.

ally fuddled; the currency bill was up, and
be" forthwith proceeded to specify upon
ihe fortification bill which was quite natural,
considering that topers usually have
less love for cash than for fighting. After
proceeding about half an hour, a friend
took the liberty to hand him the currency
bill, hinting that that was the subject of discussion.
The hint was kindly taken, and
the mistake discovered, whereupon the
honorable member cried out, "Mr. Speaker!
I don't know as my. remarks exactly
bit the subject under discussion but I think
they apply as well to that a# any thing else.
The House was in an uproar of laughter
at the drunken wit, and permitted the
member to finish his speech in the extraordinary
short space of one hour and a
half.?Montpelier Watchman.
