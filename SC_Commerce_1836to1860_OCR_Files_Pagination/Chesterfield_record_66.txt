11) liing |ve'?!:"r i:i the relative situation of!
the United Sates and Texas, our acknowledgment
of its independence at such a cri- 1

we have here otbre held ourselves bound lo
treat all similar questions. Hut there are
circums'ances in the iviatiorls of die two
countri''s which require us to acq on this J
ore 'siou, with even nurc than our wonted i
airion. Texas was once claimed as a !
part of our properly, and ;h re arc those ;
among our ci izens who, always reluctant to
I
ah avion mat claim, cannot but regard with i
soliccudc the prospect of the reunion of the i
territory to this country. A large propor- J
tion of its civilized inhabitants are emigrants
from ?he United States; speak the same Ianguage
with ours Ives; cherish the same .
principles, political and religious; and are '
- r __ i... _r
i) ?unu to many 01 our ci izcns uy ucs ui

ail, it is known that the People of that roan- ,
trv have ids itnted the same form of governintuit
wi'h irur own; and have, since the
close of your last session, openly resolved,
on the acknowledgment hy us of their Independence,
to seek admission into the Union
as one of the Federal S at^s. This last
eircunis anee is a matter of peculiar delicacy,
and forces upon us considerations of the
gravest character. The title of Texas to
the territory s!ie claims is identified with I
her independence; she asks us to acknowl- 1
edge ti?af title to the territory, with an avowed
design to treat immediately ofi s trans
fer 'o the Uni ed S ates. It hocomes us to
Mnvare of a too early movement, as it might
subject us, however unjus Iv, to the impu.oi.ou
of seeking o establish the claim of our
neighbors to a territory, with a view to its
subsequ 'ut acquisition by ourselves. Pru- '
denee, therefore, seems to dictate that we
should st.il stand aloof,-and maintain our I
present attitude, if not until .Mexico itself,
or oje of the groa' foreign Powers, shall recognise

Your Committee are quite willing, and p
they h -lievo the Senate would desire to re- a
cord their entire concurrence in the wishes , li
so emphatically expressed by the Governor i t]
for the preservation of the neutrality of our : c
government in the subsisting contest he- n
t ween tiiese two powers. I lis Excellency's ; r
views embiace principles as clearly in con- '
fortuity with the maxims ofinternational law, i:
;is tiiev are with the lessons of sound policy i \
and jus ice. Our government should cer- 1
tainly maintain all those relations towards t
Mexico which are at once sanctioned by the i
faith of existing treaties and usages the of I r
civilized nations in amity with each other. : r
Nor does your Committee believe that there ; s
is the slightest reason to apprehend that | \
the independence of Texas will be rccog- j
nized by our government, until she has (
vindicated her claim to such recognition, c
by a victorious possession of the country,1 [
and by establishing a government defado t

independence.? When this event shall ;
% occur, this question, as well as that of her ' r
\oluntnry admission into this I'nion, may i
be safely confi led to the only constitutional s
tribunal to which it properly belongs, the 1
Congress of the United States, and in the c
deliberations necessarily involved in this
1 subject before that body, your Committee j (
have no reason to Mieve that the dele-! t
ga'ion from Scutli Carolina will not dis- j 1
'charge, in a manner eminently satisfactory :
to tlieircons itucnts. their duty lo their coun- . t
try, and that porJon of this confederacy 11
having the deepest and most abiding inter- s
ests in the question. : i
Here your Committee would willingly I
leave this subjee',under a painful reluctance t
they cherish to nuke any course which might t
seem to mdica e a difference ot opinion be- j
tween our late Executive and this body, who s
has just retired from the discharge of the t
duties ot* an office which have served to : t
confirm his high and irrevocable claims :o : I
the gratitude and confidence of his country. ! I
But the discussion has been forced on your s
Committee by the Report of the House of] \
Representatives, transmitted for our con- c
curivno'*, which s"ems to afford an unequi- 2
vocal sanction to the sentiments which our c
late (iovcrnor seems to entertain of the res- ' 1
peetive claims of the contending parties to ; <
our svmpatliy and regard. j r
In expressing this dissent from the opinions
of our late Executive, we arc prepared 1
to do justice to the exalted motives of patrio ; r
tism which have influenced views which wc t
may deem ;o b; erroneous. ! I;
Your Committee arc cons'rained to say j
that on this topic, they differ with him on the
declaration that both Mexico and Texas !
arc equally entitled to our sympathy, which 1
is precisely tantamount to the proposition j
that neither can invoke any such a feeling;
for it will be scarcely pretended that Mexico P
in her career of violated faith and stupen-1
dous atrocity, can put in any such a claim, j
Cpon a simple statement of facts, it remains
to lie seen whether Texas has just pretcn. I J
sion to challenge any interest 0:1 our part in I
her present s'rugglc. j
The cause of Texas is identical with *
the cause which severed the Colonies of
No;\h America from the parent Country, j ^
It is a radical mistake to suppose that the { F
Revolution in Texas was commenced hy a j
band of mere adventurers, unsustaincd by a i resident
population in possession by a legal j
title of chartered rights and a portion of the j
property of the country. The truth is,that at j (
an early period after the acquisition of Lou- j
isiana, when Spain exercised scarcely any !
jurisdic ion, civil or military, over this vast ;
Territory, the hardy emigrants of our ! a
Western Frontier pushed their cnterprize j
into these solitudes, and commenced settle- j ?
mcnts which have since become the most j
flourishing portions of the Country. The (
infant settlements gradually increased, and .
in the struggle between Spain and her Pro- j ?
vinces, Texas rendered the mos: essential
services to the common cause of liberty j p
and righ\ j
Immediately after the termination of the
struggle by which Spain lost her Colonies j
0:1 our Continent, the actual settlers in Texas
obtained guarantees and charters for the j ;
encouragement of emigration and settle- j
incut, which allured an enterprising portion 1
of the people of the United States within her :
limits, under the faith of the most solemn
compacts. These were violated without a j P
colour of justice, under a despotic jealousy la
of the growing importance of Texas, and B
in the most li igrant manner, and it was not
until 1 he Confederacy of the Provinces was V
flagi iously over.hrowed by the substitution M
of a consolidated central despotism, that '
Texas resisted,and even her resistance was ! S
not commenced until she had exhausted ! ni
every resource of supplication and ronton- j W
s ranee. Her resistance rested like that of j
t'ic former Colonics which now form these j cc
independent States, on a violation of char- , Si
tercel rights and constitutional guaran- j K
tees. And if in a cause so just and holy, j
many of the gallant spirits of our own j L
country have hastened to her standard, it C

pie force of those public principles which
justify her resistance. m
Since the invasion of Texas events have i111
supervened which arc well calculated to 1 to
augment the sympathy which our people I
may have felt, even in the abstract right in- ! ^
volved in the contest. We need not refer to |
the infamous and llagitious barbarity of her j
invaders, when, flushed with a temporary I -E
success, tiiey were able to perpetrate the S
most atrocious violation of the rights a ad ^
usages oi civilized warfare. If these, for a ;
time were calculated 10 challenge the deep j C
concern and commiseration of our own ^
countrymen, for a people sufiering under,
every extremity of human misery and de- j '<
solution, when the tide of war turned and its j e!
current was rolled back with tremendous I a'
lbrce?when a victory the mcsi splendid, of
which the annals of modern times afford
scarcely a parallel, was followed by a hum- '
nni'y and moderation equally unexampled, v
if i> quite natural to stijipose that this svm- ix
naihv mm fh<* nart of onr :>* <q?! * wend ! " Il
irgcly increased by the admiration they I
-ouliJ (eel towards a handful of brave men, j
>*ho had vindicated their claim to an Emire
by the rights of war and by the glorious j
.{tributes of mercy and Christian civiliza-;
ion. To check this current of confratcr- \
iity and feeling would be treason against j
iur common nature, and that moral sentinent
upon which the preservation of our
iwn liberties must rest.
The sequel of this dwply interesting'
Irama must bo left to the dispensations of a 1
vise Providence, whom we are taught to be- j
ieve orders even* thing for the best. There
nay be those who suppose that it will be j
icitlier lite policy of the United States to 1
ecognize the independence of Texas or to
idmit her into the Union. We do not de;iro
to anticipate the vast considerations
vhich enter into this subject. To such
jcrsons, it might be said, that although both '

cannot strike Texas from the map of the !
physical globe, or from her territorial loca.
ion. There she stands as our neighbor,
or good or for evil, touching our frontier
it a point of intimate community with our
nosr sensitive interests, and alluring by her j
mmctise and boundless fertility of soil, a j
itream of emigration which is destined to
|
nuke her a great State in our Confederacy.'
>r a powerful separate empire.
Nor is it to be concealed that the interest
which our people foul in her future des- {
iny, is in no small degree augmented hv 1
tor having not only domestic institutions '
malogous to our own, hut fr??m ?he fact j
iiat she has already been threatened with i
lie hostility of Croat Britain and the oppo- j
tition ot the free States of our own Union, 1
>y reason of these very institutions which j
lave been engrafied in her new Constitu- i
ion as a part of the fundamental law of
be land.
If these events admonish us of the ncces- j
iity of maintaining a strict neutrality he- t
ween the eon ending parties, they likewise |

preparing and expect to send out during the
year 72 male and female missionaries to the
following most important stations: To
Northern India 10?to the Western Indians
24?to Smyrna 10?to Africa 4?:o Caleu:ta
8?and to China 18. Of this number
28 are already engaged, and the re-inforcemcnts
to Northern India, to Smyrna, and
to Africa, will be ready to embark in a short
time. To sustain their present missions,
and the proposed enlargement, seventy-five
thousand dollars will he required, and from
the spirit manifested by the churches, it is
confidently expected, that they will no: per.
mil the missionaries to be detained from the
perishing heathen, for want of the means
necessary for their support.
A. B. C. F. M.?The thirty-two missionaries
for the Sandwich Islands, embarked
on board foe Mary Frazicr, Cap:. Sumner,
on Tuesday morning. An uncommonly
large concourse of interested friends
attended. After singing, prayer was offered
by Rev. Dr. Jenks.
A light wind from the south cast detain
ecJ the vessel lor about hours. This alforded
time to put every thing in the state
rooms in perfect order, and was, therefore,
advantageous lo the passengers. At ton
o'clock on Wednesday morning they sailed,
with a fine breeze and cheerful minds.
The vessel we are told, is a good one,
and the officers, men of experience, accustomed
to the seas they are lo pass, and of
excellent character. The missionary stores
and various articles sent out by the board
constitute the whole freight. The liberal
and anxiously careful provision made by the
owners for the comfort and happiness of all
on board, is, wc believe, duly appreciated
by the missionaries and their friends.
