y THE DAIRY.
The properties of a good milk house arc, i
tliat il be cool in the summer, and moder- <,
atelv warm in the winter, so as to preserve s
a temperature of about 4~> degrees through- ,
out the whole year ; and that it be dry, so as .
to admit of its being clean an sweet at all ,
times. A butter dairy consists of three t
apartments?a milk house, a churning house (
with a proper boiler, and other convenien- j
ces for scalding and washing the imple- r
ments, which should be dried out doors when ,
the weather will permit. The cheese dairy ,
should likewise consist of three apartments ,
?a milk house, a scalding and pressing ?
house, and a sal ing house. To tb.ese may t
be added a cheese room or loft. A dairy ,
for a small family may be formed in a thick .
walled dry cellar, having windows on the (
north and east sides, which are preferable for ^
fontilhitinn. In winter these windows should .
have double sashes, and in summer, a fixed
frame of close wire netting, or hair cloth, to j
exclude flies and other insects.
In most places cows are milked twice in '
twenty-four hours, throughout the year. t
Where quantity of milk or cheese is an ob- j
jeer, three times milking must be prefera- j
hie ; but as twelve hours are necessary for
the clue preparation of the milk in the cow, ,
it must be inferior in qualify if drawn more ;
than twice a day. Whatever be the times t
of milking, the milk should be drawn off L
clear; otherwise, what is left will be rcab- |.
.sorbed into the system, and no more be gen- j
crated than is requisite to supply the quanti- (
ty actually drawn. The milker, whether a (
man or woman, ought to be mild in man- ,
ners, and good tempered. If the operation r
is performed harshly, it becomes painful to t
the cow. who, in this case, oficn brings into .
action her faculty of retaining her milk at
pleasure; but if gently performed, it seems |
rather to give pleasure. When cows are (
ticklish, they should be treated with the most ,
soothing gentleness, and never with harshness
or severity ; and when the udder is hard ,
and painful, it should be tenderly fermented {
with luke-wurm water and stroked gently ; ' .
by which simple expedient the cow will be | j
brought into good temper, and will yield her (
milk without hesitation. Whenever the teats <
of the cow become scratched, or wounded, |
so as to produce foul or corrupted milk, it (
ought on no account, to be mixed with the (
sweet milk, lest it should taint the atmos- (
phere, and thus prove injurious to the rest of
the milk. j.
Cows should be milked as near the dairy ! ,
as possible, in order to prevent the necessi- i,
tv of carrying and cooling the milk before it'
is put into the churning dishes. Every cow's
milk should be kept separate till the peculiar
, properties of such is so well known as to ,
admit oftheir being well classed, when those .
that are most nearly allied, may be mixed ,
together. The very best quality of butter
can only be economically made in those j
dairies where cheese is also made; because ,
in them the best part of each cow's milk (the (
first drawn ofT) can be set apart for throwA
|
ing up cream, t!>c cast part ot tins cream
(the first separated) can be taken in order (
to make into butter, and the remainder, or (
all the rest of the milk and cream of the
dairy, can be turned into cheese. The spoili
7 taneous separation of cream, and the production
of butter, are never effected but in
consequence of production of acid i:i the
milk. Hence it is, that where the whole
milk is set apart for the separation of cream
and the whole of the cream is separated, the
milk must necessarily have turned sour before
it is made into cheese ; and no very
excellent cheese can be made from milk I
which has once attained that state.
BEES.
Some persons that keep Bees neglect to
take them up until some weeks after they
have been consuming the honey in the hive.
The bee ceases to procure honey as fast as
they consume it earlier in the season than
is generally supposed. They lose after the
first of September until they have access to
Buck-wheat that is in bloom. They will not
generally collect honey enough to support
them in the two last weeks in August unless
the weather is very favourable to their labouring,
and the season is wet, so as to keep
a supply of honey in the flowers. We have
sometimes weighed hives every week or
fortnight, and found that in a dry season the
hives were heaviest the last of July. A hive
that gained ten pounds a week in the last of
June and first of July, lost 3 lbs. from July
23 to Aug. 6th. During this fortnight, the
weather was as warm as it had been anytime
in the season, but it was very dry and
of course the flowers afforded but a little
honey. If any person supposes that bees
will gain, at this season of the year, let hint
weigh his hives every week, and he will
soon be convinced to the contrary? unless
*
his bees have an unusually good pasture.

FATTENING IIOGS. <
On the first day of December, four slioats t
of the same breed, nearly of a size, and as }
much alike in every respect as could be so- i
lected from a herd of ninety-odd hogs, were s
made choice of; each carefully weighed and t
placed in a separate stye, where their food \
could be exactly regulated. They weighed ?i
between ?1 pounds and 100. The two, t
whoso weights together made 1st.) pounds, 1:
were fed on one gallon of shelled Idian corn, t<
weighing seven pounds to each, for every u
twenty-four hours, and as much water as s
they wanted. This quantity of food was a v
plenty for them : generally tiiev about con- e
aimed it. Some live or six different days g
between the first of December, and fourth of ti
January, the time the experiment was going n
3n. they did not eat their whole allowances, b
For the two slioats, whose weights toj*ethcr
made 173 pounds, seven pounds of n

ill owed them exactly half the weight of meal
.vhich the others had of raw corn. The
>even pounds of meal were daily mixed with
>caiding water, and then well boiled : the
vhole process of cooking was done on an
iverage of one and a half hours. Thev
* tt
vere all fed twice a day, and at the same
ime. The evening feed of the shoats, fed

dlowance oflT) pounds of rnush, was just jis
much as ho appeared to want, or would ^

f hose fed on the mush assumed a more
hrifty. healthy, fresh appearance, partial- j(
arlv of their liair, and this difference became
tt
norc striking as the experiment advanced. ^
On the 4th of January, while preparations u
vere making fl>r killing and dressing, they j
verc again weighed on the hoof. One of ^
hose, then, whose daily allowance had been ^
seven pounds of corn each, had increased
20 pounds in the '24 days ; the other which ^
lad had an equal allowance of corn, had increased
only live pounds. I could not account
for the dillerencc by any thing 1 could j
liscover. either before or after killing: the

ippctites of these two were much more alike j
han of the others ; and their health was ap- ^
jarontly equally good. ,

A Pastor.
About twelve months since, I bad the
leasure of introducing into my church a
tdy, who with her husband had long connuotl
an enemy to the cross of Christ,

> convince her of sin, and righteousness,
iid judgment, and after a variety of oxerises,
severe and protracted, she was enaled
to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ for
lb and salvation, and enjoyed, as a blessJ
consequence, that peace which the world
m neither give nor take away.
I regret to say, that, though her husband
iiccrfully joined her in parties of pleasure,
nd fully participated in all the fashionable
lilies which distinguished them, yet he had

appiness was identified. In fact, his seep,

Imngc in his wife's views and feelings, ai
rst, with sentiments of pity; but when he
mnd that she was steadfast in her princiles,
and decided in the course she hat
larked out for herself, he became angr\
nd peevish.
I fear that many Christian females, whose
ushands know not (rod, by injudicious
onduet strengthen the prejudices whicl
icy wish to break down, and instead of at.
acting repel. I am happy to record, tc
le honor of my friend, a course of prudence
ropriety, and affection, the reverse of this,
he kept cons mtly in mind the apostolic
ljunction.W ives. submit yourselves un>

^
[er religion, happily, was eminently loveh
nd attractive, yet entirely free from mcai
nd sinful compliances. It did not partake
fthat pharisaic spirit which says. Stand by
am holier than thou. At the same time
was sufficiently marked to show forth it;
ue character. Nor was the religion o
ly excellent friend, of that si'' ly, fas-idiom
haractcr which is unable to distinguish be
veen the urbanities of life and conduct whicl
;offensive in the sight of God. Thus, by;
onstant exhibition of cheerful piety, sin
oftened, in a great measure, the asperities
f her husband's empor, and weakened hi:
rejudices. Yet she was not the compan
3ii with whom he once could sing, am
ancc, and enter into company. Agains
very species of Sabbath violation she do
idedly set her face; on this subject he
irmness was now to be put to the tesf.
Her younger sister was to be married t?
, worthy young man, and the ceremon;
ras to be performed under the maternn
oof. Mrs. was anxious to be pre
ent, especially as her sister was to lean
mmediatcly for the " far west," and the pro
oability of seeing her again for a long tim
r> conic was not great. Just before tb
leparturo, she was informed hy her husbam
hat an unexpected circumstance had oc
aired which prevented him from leaving
ionic that day. " Well," replied she, "
mi very much disappoiutcd, but I must sub
nit." "O no," said he, " you shall not b
lisappointed ; we can go to-morrow, (Sun
lay,) and shall reach your mother's hous<
n good season." " I thank you for you
iitcnded kindness," replicrd she, "but as to

mchanged. Nothing but a deed of mere;
vould justify me in travelling on the Sab

After giving an acount of' the wedding

11 am really surprised, wife, that you woul<

ruth, J was quite disposed to be angry witl
'ou for it; but upon reflection I can bu
espect you for your consistency. I neve
bought much nbuot religion, and one reasoi
e is, I have seen so little of it in those wl
e pretend to have a great deal. But if it w
e make me what it has made you, (thou<
it ! you were always a good wife) it is wortl
- j of more attention than I ever bestowed upc
e j it." I need not say how much atfected tli
L* j young Christian sister was, by the avow
r of her husband. Since the time referred t
, I Air. has appeared in the sanctuai
. | in company with his wife ; and though thei
, is no decided evidence that he eas experiei

t | questionably a great change of outwai

1 mend to all the wives who read your jou

21 again and again they sunk under t!

j of drunkenness. They were seen staggc
~ j ing away from these haunts of horror at
despair, to sleep in some cheaply purchast
lodging for the night, and the ensuing d;
r found them again running the same ing!
11 rious round of revelry and ruin.
ho I One of them, one night,t was taken up
ill drunk and stupified in a snowstorm, almost
;h perished with the cold, and finally ended Jus
jy days in a hospital. Two others became

: On one occasion, whilst shooting with his son, v
the latter came unexpectedly upon a iion, and <y'y
fired but missed hisaim,whentheanima! rush,
ed fiercely upon him. The father, who witnessed
at a distance what had occurred,
with all that coolness and confidence which v
those only who are accustomed to such en* l^f~:
counters can command, came to his son's
assistance, and, approaching within a few .
yards of the spot where the lion lay with
closed eyes, growlingover its victim, whom
it seemed to press closer to the earth, as if
fearful of losing its prey, he levelled his
piece and fired; the ball passed through the
animal's head, when it rolled over, and, after
a lew struggles, expired, near' the body
of the young man, who, to the inexpressib'e
joy of his parent had sustained no serious
injury, although it was some time before lie
recovered from the terror into which he had
been thrown. On my remarking that it
was a surprising deliverance, 'Yes,' he replied
emphatically, 'God was there!' "

Mr. Preston, in his speech concerning the
Rail Road, on Monday last, drew a very
striking contrast between the difference of
character of the people of the Northern
and the Southern parts of the Union, and
the consequently opposite condition of the
countries that they inhabit.
Me said that no Southern man can journey
(as ho had lately done.) through the
Northern States, and witness the prosperity,
the industry, the public spirit, which
i tiny exhibit?the sedulous cultivation of all
! those arts l>v which life is rendered comfor|
table and respectable?without feelings of
deep sadness and shame, as he remembers
! his own neglected and desolate home.

son anil every thing performs a part towards
the result, and the whole land is
covered with fertile fields, with manufactories,
and canals, and rail roads, and public
edifices, and towns and cities. Along the
route of the great New York canal (tiiat
glorious monument of the glorious memory
of I)e Witt Clinton) a Canal, a Rail Road,
and a Turnpike, are to be seen in the width
of perhaps a hutidred yards, each of them
crowded with travel or overflowing with
commerce. Throughout their course lands
that before their construction would scarcely
command five dollars the acre, now sell
lor fifty, seventy five, or a hundred. Passing
along it, you sec no space of three miles
without a town or a village, and you
are never out of the sound of a Church
bell.
We of the South are mistaken in the
character of these people, when we think
of them only as peddlers in horn flints and
I bark nutmegs. Their energy and enterj
nrizo are directed to ail objects, great and
I small, within their reach. At the fall of a
| scanty rivulet they set up their little manufactory
of wooden buttons or combs?they
plant a barren hill side with broom-corn,
and make it into brooms at the bottom?
and on its top they erect a wild-mill,
j Thus at a single spot you may see the air

them. But the same time' the ocean is
I whitened to its extremities with the sails of
their ships, and tiie land is covered with
their works of art and usefulness.
Massachusetts is perhaps the most flour,
ishing of the Northern States. Yet of natural
productions she exports but two arti;
cles?granite and ice. Absolutely nothing
but rock and ice ! Every thing else of her
commerce, from which she derives so much
wealth, is artificial?the work of her own
7 #
hands.
All this is done, in a region with a bleak
i climate and sterile soil, by the energy and
11 intelligence of the people. Each man
knows that the public good is his individual
advantage. The number of rail roads and
other modes of expeditious intercommuni,
cation, knits the whole country into a close,
ly compacted mass, through which the productionsof
commerce and of the press, the
e.onH tho m^ans of know]
I COIIUUIIS U1 iiic uuu
edge, are universally diffused ; while the *
; close intercourse of travel and business
: makes all men neighbors, and promotes a
I common interest and common sympathy.
In a community thus connected, a single
flash of thought pervades the whole land,
1 almost as rapidly as thought itself can fly.
The population becomes, as it were, a sin
gle set of muscles, animated by one
; heart, and directed by a common senso
rium.
How different the condition of things in
the South! I lere, the face of the country
' wears the aspect of premature old age and
decay. No improvement is going on?
nothing is done for posterity?no man
thinks of any thing beyond the present moment.
Our lands are yearly tasked to their
... ? nf nrnrhmtion. and when
UIIUU51 ??? ,
exhausted are abandoned for the youthful
West. Because Nature has been prodigal
to us, we seem to think it unnecessary
to do anv thing for ourselves. The indus
O #
try and skill that converted the inclement
and barren hills of New-England into a
garden, in the genial climate and fertile soil
of the South would create almost a paradisc.
Our natural advantages are among
the greatest with which providence has
blessed mankind, but we lack the spirit to
enjoy and improve them. The rich ore is
beneath our feet, yet we dig not for it.
The golden fruit hangs from the bough,
and we lid not our hands to gather it. The
cask of delicious liquor is before our eyes,
but we are too lazy even to broach it. In .?
thinking, in writing, and in talking, we are
equal to any people on the face of the earth
?but we do nothing but think, write* and
* talk.
