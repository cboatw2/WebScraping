From the Soumtern Crisis.
MR. VAN BUREN-IJIS VOTES AND
PRINCIPLES.
We continue a brief view of the political
history of our distin.gnished Chief Magistrate.
We have seen lhm ump to tihe concliusiona of tihe
war. to have been naot only its ardent supporter
romt tihe coimimiencetent to its !!lorionq tvrmm
utioni, blit to have been i-ivariab:y chosena by
the Se-nnte of Ne w York, as its war Spcakcr omn
all occasions where it was necessary.
We have seen him, the" active snpporter of
Jeffe'tsou am of the Jelrerson Party, in Nen.
York-and an active and decided opponent or
the tCnited States Baik. Let its now notice
his course after the war. lit February, 1815.
the State showed itself gratettil for the servie-es
already rendered to the country by Mr. Vian
Buren, by siecting him Aitorney General ol
State. Tht Legisture, during tihe sane ses
sion, elected hint Regent of the University of
New York.
In 1816. a still further degree of confidence
was repoised in him !.y ihis constituents, by re
electine him to the Senate of the Sta'e.
Ot tie 16th Anril, 1816. 31r. Van Bnrem
moved a further apprpriation by the State for
accurate survers ant estiates in relation to
the great Erie Canal. which was adopted.
On the I Ith of April of 1817, the hill to coni.
mence this work caine up and received his
cordial aud able support. Mr. Clinton. its
projector. publicly thanked himim in the mn-'st
flattering terms. Ttis great scheme of internmal
State improvenments was mucli indebted to
Van Buren for its coinplete success.
In March, 1S1ti, DeWit Cliiiton was nomi
iated by the RepiMicani Conveition for Goy.
ernoir. Martin Van Buren acquieswel in it,
thoumigh individatly opposed to the niomination'.
During this admmitnistration, Mr. Clinttona's
coirse was such as tip split the Party-M r. Vanl
Buren beint at the head of time opposition.
On this accouint Mr. Clint'on had him r: noved
from tihe ollice of Attornaev General This viin.
lent ant made Mr. Van Buren tihe more dear
to that part of Republican Party who were op
posed to Clinton.
At the close of Clintan's termi of service. time
veteran patriot and leader of'the War party, D.
D. Tmpkins, was tiominated Ior Governor
by the Van Bnren party Clinton, however.
was elected by about 15.000 imajority ont of
94,000 voes. 'At his flormnirelectioi. the whol
unner of votes against himi were only 1,500!
The Legislature. however, were thoroigh ite
ptblican. ani re-appointed \1 r. Van Buren At
torn--y Geieral. ilie delited. however. to ac
c. pt of it. Te ctet between thiee distin
gnihied mii. Clinton and Van Biren, was
carried onl for vears. Twice was Clintonm dii
vein intmo retii einent; ati twice was Van Bnren
removed froimn office. Yet have bothi of these
st.itesmenm, in 'ublic amid it' private. borne testi
tmany to the "tupri*ghtne'ss and honesty of his
rival." Speakiig of these contests, alter Clin
ton's death. and when miet. a aa memmher of the
New York delegation in Congress to d, plore
Clinton's4 death. Mr. Van Buren eloquently
and fi-elinv oibserved:
"Bit in other respecs it is iow inimnaterial

They have been turinted to nothing. ani
less than nothinig by tie event we deplore,

said lie was ignorant of what the popular w il

is said. "see how lie trims his sail to the
breeze'" . .
We now w'il notice two events ini an Bi
ren's life which have drawn upon hin thie ar
tillerv of his oppo'eits.
One is his support of Rufus King for the
United States Senate. lin 18h9. owinig to the
course pursued by Clinton. asi has been beijire

In time early part of 1.a0, a pubbme mteetinr

Clinton. whmoun Van Burenm had been opposinig
for four years. recoummemnded anm expression of
time opinion of time Legislature mf New York otn
this question; and int accordanice therewith, res
olutionis were got up, instucting their Senia
tors i Congress "to oppose the admiission, ias a
State into the Union, oi'any territory not com
prised wixthiin the originial boundary of the Uni
ted States, without mtaking time prohibitiomn of
slavery therein an indispesauble conditionm of
adimission." Tme resolutions piassed "without
division or debate."
On thme 6th February, 18-21, the Legislatutre
electdMt Ilr. Vuan Burean a member of the United
States Senatte, by a joint majority of Tw.'enty
five votes over Mir. Sanfo'rd, Mr. Santford re
ceiving time Clintiomi amid Federal votes.
Thme convetion to revise the constitution of
New York, met on thi-e -asth Aumgusm, 1&2l, Mr.
Van Buren, tunexpec'tedly to hinself, was re
turned a delegate fromt Oswego couanty
Theconstitutiont was fraamed in 1717, and
..... .an ier ofeousec, tuuch disfigured with
defects-liavimg mtinuch of tue impress of mon
archical institutions upon it. It was composed
by the most distinguished and veneramle men in
the State.
Mr. Van Buren had been active, in origina.
ting this conivention "avowedly for the exten
sion of popular rights," and was one ofthe lead
ing spirits in it.
Thme principal feature with which Mr. Van
Baren's name lsin been connected by his oppo
ne-its. was with the riglt ofsnifrage. The fle
publicais. hended by V:n Bren, introdiced a
propositiii that. "harin. paid tores. teorked on
thclightrauns ordone militai-ydit. and a tesi
dence of six months in the State, should qituali
fy a person L- be an elector.
* The Federa'isti opposed the measure. and
required a property qualification of $250. to
vote for Setnators! This Mr. Van Burenm zeal
onAsly opposed, in a speech, which we shall puh
Ii lied in a short timne. The restriction promosed
was rejected. To render this odions to then pen.
ple! and causeits reiectioin. the Federalists pro
posed nuicersal snffrage-black as well as white.
The old constitution baod no diistiniction in regard
t,) color. Mr. Van Buren opposed this, re
nmarking-"we are chcapening this invaluable
right. lie was disposed to go as far as any
man in the extension of rational libertv: but he
could not consent to undervalue this precions
privilege so far as to confer it. with an undis
crimintig hand, upoi every one. black or
white, who wmuld be kind enouigh to conde
scend to take it "
He therefore proposed, as the convention
bad recoganised the right of tie blacks to vote to
restr'et them to a property qtualification of
$250!
We now find Mr. Van Birten in a higher
md miore conspicuous sphere of action-the
Senate ofthe United States.
As a member of the New York Senate, he
had early introluced a bill to abolish imprison
ientt for debt, amid had laboired for years though
nusiecessfully, to aet it passed in'to a law biy
tie I.gislattire. [ip now co-operated wit I
Col. Joinson. in the same noble purpose, in the
United States Senate.
[[e also proposed to amend the constitution
so as to keep the choice of President and Vice
President from the 1louse of Representatives
atd cotfine it to the people-the legitimate
source ofa'l porer. The House, however.
was toi tenaciois of its power. and he wascom
pelledt to abmdou tihe menasure.
As chairman of the Judiciary committee, lie
reportel a hill to abolish three new circuits-to
appoiet three new judges to the Supreme court,
ail tit extend the ietiefits of the Utnited Stites.
and to this hill Alabama is namw iidebted for the
United States Circuit within her limits.
In 1827. the attention of Congress was oc.
cupied with a Bankruipt bill. Mr. Van Buiren
took aii active part in the disenscioti. He was
in iltvor of all the provisions of the hill, bit
the 9:kI section. which proposed to extend the
act I o a!1 classes.

When a candidate for the Vice Presidency, lie

Such is a brief and hasty outline of Van Bit

which came before tile Senate. lie was found
by the side of Macon, Berrien. Randolph and
Tazewell, on all such questios-and allmost
invai iablv, save the Taritivote. in opposition to
to General lIarrison. H aidolph and Hurrison
did not differ more widely thtan did Van Buren
and Harrison.
I, l11, he, inaccordance with Republican
usage. aided in noinnating, in Congressioial
cancns, Crawford for the Presidency.

DESTRUCTION OF THE ST EAMER

U. STATES MAIL.
The Steamer Vanderbilt, Capt. Smith,
arrived here yesterday from Wilmington,
with two of the four mails die from New i
York, a considerable portion of the othe-r
1wo. (due on lFridav and Saturday bast)
having been lost at sea, caused by the
Governor Dudley, which left here on
Saturday afternlotln, comintg in collsion
with the North Carolina, bound here, a.
bout one o'clock on Sunday mornine, the
resuilt of which was the sinking of lhe lat.
ter in about ten minutes after the occur
rence, there being barely time to save the
lives of the pagsengers.
We have been kindly favored with the
iollowing particelars. furnished by one if
the passengers of the North Carolina.
The steamboat North Carolina. com
manded ty Capt. Dav'is, left Wilmington
(N. C.) on Saturday afternoon, at six o'
clock. with two United States Mails. for
the South, and the following passengets.
viz:-Hon. Mr. Hubbard, Ala. lady and
child, Hon. Dixon H. Lewis. ofdo.. hilne.

Of H :amibrg, S. C.
The pass'age was very pleasant until we
reac-hed % initi about 25 or 30 miles oih

formettd us that the saten, lt Gov. Dud

Both hots apenitred to our informaut,
(who was ot dlck) to be steering toward.,
each tther. Whene lite Gov. Dudley ;ep.
proeied within about 150 yars. a cry
was raised by a pissenger to -iook out! -
Flee hoats will strike." The hells olt the
North Carolina were alostis instanatly runa-,
in about hif a tinie before the boats

North-Carolina abreast of the saloon. awl
against the quarter boards on the larboard
side of the fornier. She liged imnei'di
titely, (say in alhoe 10 ninuite) and the
pat-sengers aot oi hoaird the yawl bouts.
li the interim. the Governer D-adley. was
undergoing an examina tion, after %% bichs.
all her boats were sent to the No' th Curo
lina.
The passengers anid crew were soon
plaed onl board the Gov. Dudley, send
every effort was used to -ave their prop
erty. Some of the trunks .nd baggate
were suvedl, but all of themn in a d.imagen
condition. Sin2ulr it relate. ut of some
thirty or forty persosss, not a life wa, lo-t
One ol the peassengers, (1r. Downing, o!
Albhamna) leaped overboard in his night
r:loih,-. but was was in-tantly piiked up
by one of the boats, in cearge of Captini
Davis, who displayed considerable p:ses
enee of mind during this awful disast, r
The accident is attributed, bey Capt
Davis, toi the neglicence of the mates,n% b.
were in charue oif botlh boats, and who di.!
nor obey the regulatimns of the Cotpan%
fir their -movero nient. The regeular moode
idd down fih- ihe hoa tsis to keep to ie right;
li ott this occasion, he steam bot Gov.
Dudley kept co the lefi, which of course.
caused the concussion Capt. Smli ith, of tIle
DIdley, on coming aboard lthe North
Carolina, inquired if all ite lives were
saved., and hein- answered in the affirna
tive, expressed his dttermination to contin
ne, but after refle-ction, concluded to lay by
,he ireck until morning, which was done
in order to save the property of the pas
s,-ngers. Ar half past six o'clock, the
wreck was left by lte Dudley, and the
crew and passencers were landed in Wil
mintton at three o'clock, P. M.
The atmouttnet eel ptrolperty host by the pas
sengers is conasideral-le, ancd mnay lbe esti
mcated at from i5.000O to $20,000. Buet a
few saved their clothes, aned those whos"
trunks were pickedl up, fountd their clothes

comnpletely satturated, thaut they wiere of neo
service. The writer of this article, with
several others, haed no cheothiing~ on landing
in elhe Gtov. Dudcey. btet they were step
plied with mecwh liberality. Iby ir. Delban-.
cc, oef .Mobile, and other passengers. We
are infobrmed that sevene leather. atnd two
caenvatss hlugs, containeing the mnaihs, were
saved.
Mr. China, of La., and air. Dawson of
Ga. were both mchl injured, thee former
by cth e cossion, aend the Ia'ti, by leap
ineg from otne hosat to the othler.
The shocck was s'o sudden, that beefore
half of the passsengers dcldl get eett eof
their herihs, the' enhb-te were full oft w:,ter,
ac" most of those on board were compelled
to ceap Irotm the hutrricanc deck.
On retturnins ine the Vand:erbilt, yester~
day, neothina nas seen oh te w:eck of the

Great presenlco oef mimed was displayed
by all concernied durincg the accident.
'The night was as pleasant as could he

every thing piromnisedl a speedy ande suc

the vessels were carelessly ruin imto each

Our correspondent of the Wilmington
Advertiser, from whoem we leave recently
received several faevors, lhas obligincghy fur
warded us the followine:
WVILMCNGTON A DvErsTISlc OFrecE,
July 27, 1840.
Albeut one o'clock Isast neighet, the steamr

valuable baeggage was very great. Sever

Thic Gon. idlcy escm-,inc,1 onn the snn,
ill daylighit, with the holtpe of savinig as
nuch as possible, nnd then came on to
Niiitgloln, brioning the passengers and
rew olthe North Carolina, many of whom
lid not save a particle of their clothing.
pihe accident occurred in 11 fathoms wa.
er. 'rhe how of tho Dudley was a good
leal sh.attred, bit she inade no water ex
:ept while under way. The night was
orturnately remarkably calm. We forbear
it present, expressing any opinion in re
rgard to the causes of the accident, not
saving ime to make sufficient investiga
ton, and the accounts given being so va.
'ious. The Gov. Dudley reached Wil.
mtington about half past 3 o'clock, in the
afternoon of Sunday, and the Vanderbilt
lie samte eveoing, went down to Smith
ville, where she remains all night, to ena
Ile her to visit the place of accident in the
lay titne, to see if any further good can
be effected. Cait. Davis also goes to the
spo1, in a pilot boat, to do what he can in
savitg the remains or the wreck. There
were no ladies on board, except the wile
of the Hon. Mr. Hubbard, whose loss j0
money was larger than that of any other
imlividual. Sone few of the passengers
received slight personal injuries, but terri
ble as the occurrence has been, we have
cause to b'P thankful that no life was lost.
We will enideavor to furnish soon, a more
accut ate account of the matter.
Loss of the Steamer North- Carolina.
The Wilmingion Recorder, or the 28th
inst says. "A pariial examination of the
c:m8-01 . hieh produced the disastrous oc
currence, was gone into by the Directors
of'the Company on Mouday. The follow
facts were'eliciied:
That the Capinn of both boats were
I-leeli, it heiig on their watch helow, and
each hoat inl char::e or the chief mate.
That the tnates were at their propersta
-ions in the % heel house. the wheel in im.
mediate charge of the wheelamen.
hiat the boats' signal lanterns were
visible to each other, at a distance of sev
eral iiles.
Thar t he Dudley kept her prnr-er course,
inttending! to pass the North- Carolina land
warl.
h'lht the North Carolina after she dis.
covere d the Dudley. instead of pureuing
her own straight course, i hich would have
carried the bouts pat Parch other,wi-h -a in
Ie'rventing distance of at lea.t two hundred
%ards, kept aheting her vour-e a point or
two every now said then. until it lay di
rectly ac-oss that of the Dudley's and ine
vitably in contnct with the rate of speed
iltey were both going. As soon as the
dianger was apparent to hoth, they shut off
their steani. whereas had the North-Caro
lina not done so, she would have shot past
uttinjutred.
The whole conclusion is. that the acci
dont is to be attributed to the ignorance or
strantge fatnity of the male of the North
r'urolina. in changina her course. The
stiate's name is McQUADE's.
