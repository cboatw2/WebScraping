their shrivelled arm to you and ask you to
look nt the plumpness of it as an incontrovertible
proof of their returning vigor. Such
hallucinations are too melancholy to he
trifled with in so grave a manner.
The reasons upon which f found my assurance
of the foasibilty oi this mode of
cure arc.
Fist, a man can breathe and retain his
health with one of bis lungs only.
Secondly, nature sometimes effects a cure
by drying up one of the lungs, .td this is
die only method in which she ever does effect
a cure.
Thirdly, the operation is neither difficult
nor dangerous.
And fourthly, the diseased lung mm* be
whollv removed if necessary.

IMPORTANT JUDICIAL DECISION.
Circuit Court of the District of Columbia for
the County of Washington:
Tuesday, June G, 1S37.
? O.i the openingcf the Court, Chief Justice
Ckancii delivered the Opinion of the
Court as followed) :
On the 27th of May, 1S37, the following
Order was made by this Court :
The United States, on the relation of

vs.
Amos Kendall, Postmaster General of
the United States,
The petition of me relators, and the afiiduivit
of Lucius \V. Stockton, oik- of thorn,
having been presented to the Co irt, setting
forth in substance that the said reia'ors, having
sundry claims upon the Post Office Department
of tiic United States, under contracts
made by them with the late Postmaster
General, William T. Barry, did apply
to the Congress of the United States for relief
in the premises. That the Congress ol
the United States did, at the prayer of the
said parties, pass au act which was approved
on the 2d day of July, 1S37 ; in and by
which, it was, among other things, provided
that the Solicitor of the Treasury do
examine into and adjust the said claims
therein specified, and that the Postmaster
General credit said contractors with whatever
sum or sums of money, if any, the said
Solicitor shall so decide to be due to them
on account of any such service or contract.
That the said Solicitor of the Treasury did,
in fact, make such decision and award, and
did therein and thereby find due to said relators
the sum of 8101,503 69 for principal
and in'erest. That said Amos Kendall, although
notified of said awards and decisions,
did omit and neglect, for a considerable
period of time, to carry tile said award
and the said act of Congress into execution,
and did, some time after, partially execute
the same, by carrying to the credit of the
said relators tl e sum of one hundred and
twenty-two thousand one hundred and one
dollars forty-six cents, (8122,101 4o ;) Ieavin?r
of the said principal sum, so award -d.
the sum of 830,472 47 sdl! due, which has
not been credited or paid, although requested.
That a correspondence took place be" "n"
t'l" rotators. ot some of them, and
l^v.v.11 , .
the President of the United States, and a
memorial was presented on their behalf to
the Senate ot the I a:tod S ates, wlio proceeded
thereupon, and upon the reports
of the Committee on the Judiciary passed
a resolution "that the Postmaster General
is fully warranted in paying, 'and
ought to pay, to W illium II. Stokes and
others, respectively, the full amount of the
award of the Solicitor of the Treasury."
That said Postmaster General, notwithstanding
the premises and other facts detailed
in said petition, still refuses, omits,
and neglects to execute the said act ol
Congress and said award, by carrying the
said sum, so withheld, to the credit of said
petitioners, wherefore the petitioners pray
the said Court to award the United States
writ of mandamus, to be directed to the
said Amos Kendall, Postmaster General
of the United Stares, commanding him?
1. That lie shall fully comply with, obey,
and execute aforesaid net of Congress ot
July 2, 183G, by crediting the petitioners
with the full and entire sum so awarded as
aforesaid, in conformity with said award
and decision; and
2. That he shall pay to said petitioners
the full amount so awarded, with interest
thereon, deducting only the amount which
shall be justly charged or chargeable to tiie
said memorialists against the same.
Whereupon, on nio:ion of Richard S.
Coxe, for the relators, and upon the reading
fthe said petition and accompanying documents,
it is the 26th day of May, 1S37,
ordered by the said Circuit Court, that the
said Amos Kendall, Post Master Genera!
of the United States, show cause, o:i
Thursday, the first da v of June next, why
the said writ of mandamus should not issue
as prayed by said memorialists; and that
a copy of this order be served on the said
Amos Kendal, Postmaster General, aforesaid.
Bv order of the Court:
'Test. \VM. BR EXT, Clerk.
May 26, 1837.
The Postmaster Genera! d;d not appear
to show cause, according to the rule.
The material facts stated in the affidavit,
upon which the rule was founded, are substantially
as follows:
By the act of Congress of the 2d of July,
1830, for the relief of William B. Stokes,
Richard C. Stockton, Lucius W. Stockton,
and Daniel Moore, the v'o!ic itor of the Treasury
was'autliori/cd u;iu directed to settle
and adjust their claims for extra services as
contrautors for carrying the mail under
certain contracts made with them, by Mr.
Barrv, the late Po.s'master Genera!; and,
for triit purpose, to inqu r m e mid determine
the equity of their dais, s for or on
account of any contract w ;h ike said Postmaster
General, on which their pay had
been suspended by the present Postina: a r
Genca!. and to make them .v.ie i ailo..
ces theivfor, as, upon a fuli examination
of a:i the evidence, might seem light according
to the principles ??:' equirv : cm;'
'jf J\vcf G'V\/. ' *, ?} , A
hereby, directed to credit such mail con!rue.
tors with whatever sums of manes, if am/,
the said Solicitor shall so decide to hs due
to them, for on account of am/ such service
or contract.
I he decided the sum of 81G1,
003 99 to be due to them. The Postmaster
Genoral has credited litem only with the
sum of?12'2, 101 40, and refuses to credit
them with the residue of the sum so decided
to be due to them, being 809, 4?"J 47.
riiosc facts, not being denied,must for the
presetp, be taken to be true: and the first
question is, whether this Court, in such a
case, has power and authority to issue a
writ of mandamus, commanding the Postmaster
General to credit the said mail contractors,
Stockton, Stokes, and others, with
the sum or sums of money decided by die
Solicitor of the Treasury to be due to them
for and on account of the services or contracts,
mentioned in the said act of Congress
of the 2d of July, 1S3G ?
The duty of the Postmsstcr G< neral und<*r
that act is clear and ohsolutc, leaving
him no discretion. It is a duty, in the
?f which f!io nrivate riirhts of
| .\CV.UUViI V? '? -.iV" ?... - J - v .
individuals are concerned; and the party
against whom the right is claimed is "resident"
within this District and county. The
right of the relators and the duty of the
I'ostmoster General appearing to be clear
and absolute, the question arises, do lite
laics afford a remedy?
If this had been a case against a State
officer, anising upon a statute of a State
in which the common law of England had
J been adopted, it wculd be a clear case for
a mandamus,* because the relators could
m
not have any other specific remedy, nor
any other remedy equivalent to a specific
remedy, recording to the forms of the common
law.
[The court next proceeded at at length to
i answer objections which had been made
to its power to issue a mandamus; a to
l which it concludes as follows.]
i nc suggestion iii.u iml* i i-.siui.-ih tsjiu
Heads of Departments are not responsible,
except by impeachment, for the exercise
of their ministerial functions, seems to imply
that the Postmaster General, like the
Heads of Departments, may shelter himself
under the authority or command of
the President. But it'they can do it, in a
case like the present, where the duty is
expressly enjoined upon the officer by an
act of Congress, this officer cannot do it,
for his relation to the President's very different
from theirs. They, in the very
terms by which their offices were created
and their duties defined, are to perform
such duties and execute such orders as
' they shall bo required to perform and execute
by the President of tlic United
States. The Secretary of the Treasury,
however, may possibly stand in a different
relation to the President, as his duties are
j better defined by law, and as there is a
j direct communication, establislied by law,
i between him and the Legislature, without
j the intervention of (lie President; but still
j he is bound bv the 21 section of the act
i of the 2d of September, 17S9, "generally
to perform all such services, relative to
'the finances,as he shall he directed to perform."
The act does not say by whom
he may he thus directed. It by the President
it is the samcas that of the other Heads
of Departments. The Postmaster (Ionoral,
however, clearly bears no site!) re lation
to the President. We cannot find a
word in the law under which lie was apI
pointed, or in the various laws respecting
the Post Office establishment; or in the
Constitution of tlie United States, which
inlmviloc .inv rnnnnviiin linhi'non him nnrt
. the President; or any authority in the
President to pi escribe his duties, or to control
him in the exorcise ofhis official functions.
It is true that lie is appointed, and
therefore may be removed, by the President.
But the President, if lie has the
power to control him, can only do it
through his fear of removal. If lie should
so control him, no act done by him under
that control couid be thereby justified,?
The Postmaster General, in the exercise
of the duties of his office, appears to be
legally as independent of the President as
; tiic President is of him. There can therej
fore be no pretence for avoiding responsibility
under any order of the President,
nor sharing the irresponsibility which may
be supposed to belong to that high officer.
That the refusal of a public officer, resi.
dent in this District, to do a ministerial
act, which by law he is positively commanded
to do, whereby an individual is
deprived of his right, is a case, eithei in
! law or equity, of which tiiis Court has
cognizance, by virtue of the fifth section of
the act of Congress of the 27th ofFebuary,
1801, "concerning the District of Columbia."
That the only adequate remedy,
in the ease presented to us, is a specific
remedy, and that the only specific remedy
is a writ of mandamus; which is a writ
"agreeable to the principles and usages
of law," and is necessary for the exercise
of the Jurisdiction" of this Court, in the
case before us.
If this Court has not jurisdiction of the
case, no Court has; and an individual who
may have been ruined by the refusal of an
officer to perform a ministerial act positively
enjoined upon him by law, will he
entirely without redress. Neither an impeachment
nor an indictment could restore
him his lost rights; and in an action upon
the case he could only obtain judgment for
damages which the officer might be wholly
unable to pay.
The Court will order a writ of man : *'

Presbyterian Church.?The General Assem
bly of tliis church in 1S01 formed a compact!
: with the Congregational churches of Con- (!
necticut, under which Congregationalists re- j
j- moving from New England to any other part j
, I of the Union, whether ministers or laymen, |
1 j have generally become Presbyterians, in name ;
'' and form at least. The Presbyterian church j
j experienced no serious inconvenience from
: this immense influx of Congrcgationalists, so :
1 j long as the New England churches generally :
' j harmonized with it in doctrine, as was the case '
f J when the compact was en'ercd into. But,

' I very rapidly in New England, and have been i
* i extensively adopted by emigrants from that
f | region who have united with the Presbyterian
i j church. One consequence has been, much
-: controversy and agitation in that church for
I i the last few years. To suppress which, and
! to conform the church to its written standards
' the General Assembly, at its recent meeting
^ in Philadelphia, not only abrogated the comc
pact above refered to, which had been cont
stantly violated by those who came in under j
it, but also cut of}' four Synods, formed under j
color of its provisions, embracing twenty-eight
II j Presbyteries, and nearly six hundred ministers
c | and individual ciiurchcs. It has also sump
moned other Synods and Presbyteries to ap^
pear at its bar, for trial, during its next annual
j meeting, on account of alleged error in docy
trine and irregularity in government. Throe

The Indians have killed Mr. McLean and
Mr. tSheridan, and a Mr. Barnes, of this settlement.
The Indians have stolen. I think,
about one hundred horses west of Mr. McLean's
within two weeks past; they appear to
come down determined to take all."
A letter rcccved in Savannah from Jefferson

that a family of la persotis had been murdered

there are some hundreds of Indians still d

will renew hostilities.

oevcrc inaeeu lias uc-en tins dispensation of
God to the friends that survive. The youth
whom he has removed from their midst, was
remarkable for those qualities of the heart
which are less observed by others, but well
known and valued by those who come immediately
within their influence. Possessing a
disposition more than usually amiable and affectionate,
and manifesting always for his family
and friends, an attachment more than usually
ardent, he could not be removed without
severe suffering to those that are left. And
removed too, so suddenly?only two weeks
before his decease, his prospect of life was as
fair as any, and but three days previously, he
was able to write to his absent brother, who
had been informed of his illness, that he might
have in his own hand the evidence of his
recovery. That letter was replied to, but
when the reply reached the family, he to
whom it was addressed, was never more, on
tnis side of Eternity, to receive the salutations
of this absent brother.
But if there has been severity in this dlspensation,
there has been goodness also, if
the cup given to these friends to drink has
been one of sorrow*, there has been hope
minffled in it. Thanks to thp Gmpp thnt hn*
" mercy on whom it will have mercy," a light
from heaven dissipate the darkness that
would else here gather around the grave.?
The wonderful calmness manifested by our
young friend throughout his illness while perfectly
sensible of his approaching dissolution,
his composure while speaking of his death,
thetenour of his conversation, the state of his
mind?proved that his thoughts had not been
unoccupied with the things of most importance
to him, which he had heard in the family
and been taught in the Sabbath School, as
well as in the Sanctuary?proved that his
heart had not .been unvisited by the Spirit of
God. And these tilings, in connection with
the silent change in his dispositions and chary
acter. which those intimately acquainted with
him, must have observed in the last two ynrs,
afford precious consolation to hearts that are
| now sorrowing with hope, and which but fcr
i this hope, must break.
