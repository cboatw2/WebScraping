the suspension of specie payment by the
Bankr, in tbis country was not known in
England : though every tlrng in relation to
our commercial difficulties, >-co ns to have
been known, except the actual suspension
of specie payments. In consequence of
the disasterous news from this country, the
Bank of England had finally determined
not to sustain the American Houses. On
the fact being made known at Liverpool,
that the Bank of England had resolved to
withhold its aid from the American Houses,
the Chronicle says; "An establishment
deeply involved with America?and one
of the largest importers of Cotton in this
.great commercial mart?immediately suspended
payment. Connected as this establish
nent is with other firms of more or
les3 importance, we cannot view the consequences
but with feelings of alarm. AVe

the "beginning of the end."

Liverpool, June 2.
The demand for Cotton received a little
check on Monday, in consequence of
the gloomy accounts received on that day
from America; but, on the whole we Imvn
had a good enquiry and steady market
throughout the week, which closes at
about l-4d. advance on American descriptions,
and previous rates lor other kinds.
As the year 1829 is now f cquently referred
to as the lowest point recorded of the
market as regards prices, in comparing
the quotations and stock at this period of
that year with our present supply and
prices, we have only to remark, that the
weekly consumption of 1829 was estima-fi
ted at 14,'331 bugs, and tli.it ot last year
19,452 bug*; it is needless to observe that
the pressure upon prices during the former
year was the result of a large supply
and relatively small consumption, whilst
on the present occasion the existing derangement
of money matters is the primary
cause of our present low rates; and
until this pressure is entirely removed *.e
cannot hope to have , any permanent improvement
in the market. Speculators
have taken 9000 American and 400 Snrat;
and exporters 1900 American, 800 Sural,
and 100 M adras, (5500 American, 250
Bahia, (500 Fgvptiun, 200 Sural, have
been forwarded into the country last
month unsold. The sales to-day are about
7000 bags of all kinds. One vessel from
Mobile, artd one from Savannah yet to
report. The import this week is *18,209
bags, and the sales are 40,200 bags.
We arc indebted to the politeness of a
mercantile friend ?fo-r the following extract
of it letter, dated |
44 Rio De Janeiro, 17th May, 1837. I
44 Since our circular advice of the '29th
nit., business has been Inactive, and within
a few days advices from Europe and
the United States are of a character so alarming
as to bring things to a pause
wherever confidence is implied. No one
is disposed to trust another, if to be
avoided.
44 Our exchanges on London has declined
to 27 1-2, but the rate is almost nominal,
as many of the remitting houses have
orders not to take any bills whatever, and
all are restricted to a very limited discretion,
as in fact no one seems to feel confident
of the standing or safety of houses
j on whom they may have drawn; some
houses have refused to honor bills drawn
against unrestricted credits granted bv
their agents in the (Jniied States, in violation
of positive honor, moral and mercantile;
the want of confidence in exchange
business covers almost the whole
surface of transactions.
44 Metals on the other hand are sought
after. Spanish dollars are selling at 2
each; Spanish doubloons 2S a 29. Portuguese
0,400 pieces a 810, and other
coin in proportion; and heavy remittances
arc being made in this way.
44 Flour.?Stock added to by almost
lailv arrivals, and may now be estimated
at little short of 10,000 barrels. Sales
are only by re ail. Nominal prices of
Baltimore IS a 19, but it would hardly be
prudent to refuse 10 for a quantity if offered?
the quality is generally objected
to. Richmond is more in favor, but only
goes oil* by retail at 25 a 39, and for pareels
of 50 to a 100 barrels a reduction of
1 or 2 would lie submitted to. Prospects
for this article ere very unfavorable.

Communications.
Foit the Courier.
Mr. Editor?T have gazed over all ll c
| papers that are of any note, and can find
nothing but matter concerning the Banks,
specie, failures, ?$lc. &c. Will you be|
kind enough to insert a lew extracts that
I have made, together with my remarks.
Head the following extract.
"The bullion business," says the New
York Express of the 21st nit " is increased
in Wall street, ami every day some

..v.. i mi. tf|H711en. win: hi me |irineipal
inducements to enter into this business
is the profit made by the continued
depreciation of irredeemable bank paper."
On the same day, city bank bills were at
111-2 to 12 per cent, discount, (the American
half dollar at par,) II. 8. Hank bills
| 13 a 14,. (what an admirable currency for
the people of the United States?) New
Kngland 13a 15, Southern 15 a 25. "It
is ti e general opinion," says the Express,
" that this depreciation will proceed.
*One per . cent, per day has been
rea'ised on Wge sums. No one can calcinate
on the future depreciation, which
will entirely depend on the future conduct
of the banks."
** 11 is fuither said that many of the
hanks, after stopping specie payments,
have sold all or nearly all their specie
I funds at a large premium, leaving their
hills afloat in the community with scarcely
ten cents in the dollar to redeem them.
This state of things is alarming; and it is
time the people were opening their eyes
to it, and taking some active steps to arrest
this evil. We hope our next Legislature
will declare every bank in the
State insolvent which does not recommence
to redeem its notes in specie at a
very short date from that time. If banks
have not the funds, under all circum.
stances< to redeem their b'lls in specie, it
is a gross imposition upon the community
to issue them An individual who
would do so would he put down as a swindling
rogue; and we know not \Vhy a corporation
doing the same thing should not
lie subject to the same imputation."
If I understand nr.y thing about Banks,
I would say, that they are limited to ninety
days* for suspension of specie payment.
I may be wrong ; if so, correct me?and
give me all the information you can respecting
this important matter.
1 make these remarks from the circum
stanco of several persons, who daily stand
in need of small chunghaving applied
for amounts of 83 and $10 in change (25,
50, &,c.) at several Banking Houses, and
could not be supplied with any smaller
than Hs or 2's.
Another matter respecting change, is,'
that several gentlemen of this place, who :
were hard run for small change, were compelled
to pay a premium to a merchant of
this town, of from 8 to 10 per cent.
I heard a gentleman (from Mobile, Ala.)
a few days ago, say, that while conducting
business in Mobile, lit: was forced
frequently to leave his oflicc, in search of
change, and that he 4* had to pay from 18
to 20 per cent premium on specie, for
8100." Is this not oppicssion in the ex
u<-iiie. * tnue tlic iDiunving paragraph
from the Tuscaloosa Intelligencer, which,
I think, will greatly benefit that place.
"The hill authorising the Ranks to issue
small notes, has become a law, and tlu
Bank in this city commenced issuing hills
on Saturday. We state the fact to show
the great want of change, that in less than
half an hour after the Bank was opened,
on Saturday morning, the Teller paid out
upwards of 8700 in small hills."
Camden, Sir, is at present very scarce
[of small chat/fff, (halves, quarters, and
| eighths,) and I think it would not he amiss

25c, and 50c. 1 am confident that the citizens
of Camden would be largely bene fitted
by k?and it would save a great deal
of time and trouble.
"The following I copy from a Charleston
paper?it is a good idea.
* Smai.i. Change.? We are just informed
that the South Carolina Canal ah I Kail
ltoad company are issuing Change Cheeks
of 25, 50, and 75 cents, which are paid
out to their workmen every week, and are
rcdemahlc at either of their offices, in
town, or at the agencies at Branchville,
Midway, Klackviile, Aiken, or Hamburg,
and also at the Bank of Hamburg, when
sums of five Dollars are presented.*'
