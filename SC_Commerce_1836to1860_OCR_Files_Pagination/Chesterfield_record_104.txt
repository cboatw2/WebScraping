currency sufficient w.iiun.t being rc.lun- (
danr, (contiucs the writer) the cardinal consideration
is, that such a currency can have
no other basis than the precious metals, ;
into which it can at any moment be con- , \ ver.eJ.
This result this scheme ellectoaiiv
secures, anu I ?anj not aware of any other ?
. 1 U
by which it can be secured. !
To do this it is indispensable that spec;c :
should bo obtained in sufficient quantity. n
and that there sliouidbe a proper limitation 11
to paper issues. Under the existing state "
of things, the banks are the great (ieposito-. P
ries of specie, and t!ie sole inauu aciuror.s a
of paper money. They exist under the au- i:
thoriiy, and are maintained by the power of a
the States. The whole nation has adopted , tl
them as necessary to the welfare of the j r
community, and ti.ey are tco intimately ; a
connected with the concerns of every man ' n
in active life to bo dispensed wi;h. Any,1'
feasible scheme, therefore, to be success- , 11
' ful, must, to a reasonable extent, be ad- j ?
dressed to liicir interests, wiiich are, in- ' J?
deed, in a certain sense, the? interests o! the j 11
whole community. I no secrctury 01 t:u- j
Treasury, in his report of December G, j
183G, estimates the sp -cie in i!:c country j ^
at seven'v three millions, of which forty- , ^
live millions were in banks. This amount ,
has been since reduced ; but there can be
no doubt that the banks s.iii possess, t r have P
the means of chaining, two-thirds of the
specie in the United States, and, it may be, i w
of obtaining fresh supplies from Europe. , t!
While their payments in specie are suspeti- ' b
ded, it must remain locked up, and cannot v
be reached by ordinary means. This plan
holds out an inducement to them to part j
with their specie by giving them an cquiva- j
ler.t for it; some may think more than an j i:
equivalent. According lo it, when in full : p
operation, tlie United States will possess . t
a fund of fifty millions of specie, for which Jp
ihcv will have absolu elv given tii; banks ^
** " .
their promissory notes, payable 0:1 demand ; ^
in specie, to the amount of fifty millions.,
and loaned them at two per centum per annum
a further sum of such notes to the j

United Sta'cs no'es will eventually consti- js
tute tlio sole currency of the country, the t
hanks bdng iuhihi'cd from issuing any i c
other. Computing their present circulation c
at one hundred millions, and their deposites c
at a like amount, they must retain in their ^
vaults a suftieioat amount of tin United a
States notes to meet any demand that may j .t
he made upon them. Fifty millions will' c
fullv answer this end. Snoull a ran at'

any tune be made upon thorn to a larger j j
amount, it can be readily met by a curtail j
of discounts that cannot fall short of four J
hundred and fifty millions.
Let us took at the reciprocal benefits as j
to strict moneyed interest of this plan, to jv
the banks, and to the nation as represented ; a

We are glad that the meeting was call- ;

joken a lesson and a warning, that will
mg he remembered with salutary effect. 1

ict, that a blow was inllictcd, in a molent

inr of the meeting?we are sure, ton, j,
tat the individual who thus forgot himself i
i the indulgence of honest and just indig- .

[ition, participates in our regret.
The person refered to in the above artie,
as having been nominated for Chairman,
as Mr. Pinckncy. He publishes a stateent
of the facts over his own name in the
ourier, from which it appears that he had
?en applied to to attend the meeting and (
eside; and that he, at flrst, doubted wheth
it was not Ids duty to do so, for the purpose ^
' discountenancing any illegal or disorderly j
easure which might be proposed; but, upon :
election, determined that it would be most j
oper not to attend the meeting at all. He
lost unequivocally declares himsef a friend
" the law and of the great principles of pub-,,
: order and tranquility.
From the character of Mr. Pinckney, we I
mid not believe otherwise, without positive j
ud irresistible proof to the contrary. Indeed I
e could hardly believe it upon any proof j
ithout believing at the same time that he j
as insane. And yet there is something un- i
Icasant in the reflection that a man of his j
(laracter was even thought of, and requested j1
3t only to attend, but also to preside on such I
a occasion. The circumstance is not ex- i,
aincd in his own published statement, nor in j
v -.tly r nab:: -V live sef,r.. As ' |
v.'j re id his statement wo could not hut regr?.t1
that we did not find in it some expression of j ?
reprobation of the very movement of calling L
a meeting which he apprehended might result j u
in disorder, if that was not the vo?y purpose i ;j
of it. The fact that ho is a candidate fur the j ^
oliice of Mayor in the city, probably made P
him careful not to use language calculated to
olfend any of t!ie voters at the election. But c
such a consideration ought not to have re- tl
strained a good man and a good citizen (and "
Mr. Pincknev is both) from speaking out hold- j ^
% [ tt
ly, and reproving tiki movers 111 a transaction ?g
so very reprehensible and unprincipled. fc

Softy Padlock.?The ingenious German,"
whose novel safety door lock wc recently no- j u
ticed, has now produced a still more intricate ' s
and curious contrivance in the shape of a pad- i u
lock. This lock is much stronger, and more I a
substantial than any padlock we have seen, j 0
though it is not larger than seme that are in *
use; and the most ingenious would llnd it;
hard studdy to open it, even with the proper j n
key. We do not know tint more than one j 5
of two individuals amoncr the number who |
have exercised their ingenuity upen it, have ! f
succeeded. {<;
There is in the first place a fine slide, cr ' f
more properly, lid over the key-hole, to be re-! j
moved only by an ingenious contrivance, con- J r
coaled from ordinary observation, before the j c
key can be applied at all; and when the key ' v
hole is thus laid open, the proper use of the ! t
key is a dcs.deratum not easily discovered.!?
The lock is so strong, that we believe no in-j (
strument which could be made to bear on it,
when fastened to a door, could break it.

The Ban1,: Convention.?While the proposi- fii
tion of General Hamilton, in relation to the j ui
re-organizatlon of the Bank of the United I N
States, has excited inquiry and discussion, his | ti'i
suggestion with regard to a Convention of all
the Banks, seems to meet with universal favor.
The New York American says: " To j _
the proposed Convention for consultation,!
however, of delegates from the Banks of the
Union, to bo held on the second Monday of
August in Philadelphia, there can, to far as
we perceive, be no rejection. Union and
concert of action amo lg those institutions, if fj
by any means to be brought about, could not J
fail of an immediately beneficial influence up- ig
on the affairs and currency of the country? pi
even though thev should, as we think they c<
could not, bring about as early as Gov. Ham- :l1
iltou seems to calculate, a resumption of spe- ^

The last sailing packet ship Oxford, Kaihorn,
arrived at this purt car.y yesterday tnop.irgfroin

We learn from a passenger, that the news
arried out hy the ship Roscoc, had cauie 1
lie Directors i f the Bank of England to ro;se
all further aid to the American merchants.
Jreat excitement prevailed in London an 1
nd Liverpool, and every thing wore a very
loomv appearance, and little or no demand

The Oxford was detained from the 1st to the
J of June, to hear what the llank of England
ad done, or would do?and after a protacti.il
;ssion of several da\s, the Directors refused
ranting any further relief to the American
auscs.
In consequence of the Banks docling ot
id the American houses, two of them have
iied, namely: Wilson, &, Co., and Wiggins
, Co.
The English papers are not sparing in their
jmmcats on our Executive; and although as
tildly and courteously expressed as could have

to their ignorant and partizan mearres
the evil wiiich is prostrating before it ev y

which derived so much employment

A few days since while occupied i.i our
ailing, wc hud the pleasure of seeing in
it* hands of Mr. Bilbo, an old and li'guly
fspectablc citizen of this Pariah, a Pearl
f the size of a common pea, and poss.??
ing in an eminent degree, all the csseniais
"of the lVarls of Ind." Mr. B. states
bat the Pearl before mentioned was accicntly
discover d by his little daughter while
ashing on Lake Culcasieu, in the body of
muscle, wliicii is peculiar to and very
bundant in that Lake. Its presence in
lie muscle was indicated bv a white spot
n the surface, and lie says, that hisdaugh:?r
informed him that she had seen many
imilar, which no doubt on examination
,'ould be found to contain the same valu- i
ble substance. We congratulate the J?
entleman wlio has recently purchased the
locus in quo" and hope that this beautiful
nd salubrious spot may prove to hint in
ruth a pearl of great price.
