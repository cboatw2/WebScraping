-2bou spirit of the viewless air,
Thy tiny wing
Ilath kissed my cheek and fanned my hair
Thou fairy king!
Thy cradle bed is yonder cloud,
In heaven's deep blue,
Above the mountain summits proud,
Where sleeps the dew.
Thy pathway is the firmament,
Thy car is light;
Or, with the solemn darkness blent.
. Thou lov'st the night.
Thou playest with the mighty trees,
And with the stream,
lb soffand gentle symphonies,
As in a dream.
ipon the billows thou dost ride,
I On Ocean's breast,
Thou comost with the trooping tide.

T1 vales and pleasant nooks thou art,
When dew drops weep,
The flowers betray the fluttoring oftby heart,
As infants sleep.
Thy wing of gossamer hath given
-A plaintive sigh
To soft Eolia's harp of heaven,
Its poetry.
Sweet Zephyr, come in sorrow's hour,
Ih death's dark night,
And let me feel thy soothing power,
So soft and bright.
THE PRINTER'S LOVE.

We love to hear our friends disclose
Th' emotions of their breast.
We love to see a ship arrive,

We love to see our neighbors thrive
And love to bless the poor.

NEW GROUND CORN.
MR. EDIToR.-There are len- of our
farmers, particularly those who cultivate
the pine lands, but are aware of the dilli
culty of rearing a good, or even a passuble
crop, upon ground of the first year's tend
ing, unless the timber be ierfictly dead,
and the ground grubbed- which latter pro
cess, is now considered unnecessarilyla
borious, as well as injurious to the land.
Even then, corn planted in it, has a ten
dency to "run too much to stalk," in other
words, producing a tall slouder stalk, wvaili
no ear on it, and in many instances, not
even a shoot. As a remedy for this, the
following simple course is recommended:
-After te Corn has been -laid by," and
the tassel pretty well blown or spread,and
the shoots formed, of the most forward
stalks, pull the tassel out of every other
rowv of Corn. This is proposed, because
the process may be more regularly ac
complished; but if tbeCorn is inore luxu
riant in ~sote spots tian in others, which
is usually the case, the tassels may be pull
ed out promiscuously, over the field,near
ly in the proportion of every other row;
but always from the stalk that has the
least, or no shoot, or where the shoot does
not appear thrifty, in proportion to the
luxuriance of the stalk. The effect is to
stop the growth upwards, of the stalk,
and thereby aid the shoot; as the strength
and nourishment, which is sent up from
the roots, ceases to be consumed in the
tassel, it forces its way out at the first
yielding point which presents itself, which
is the shoot, near the top, that produces
the ear of corn. The consequence is, that
in due time, five ears of corn appear,
where, othewise, in all probabilty, would
have been only worthless shoots. The
tassel should nothe pulled out, lower than
the second joint from the top.
This is a simple and effectiveoperation.
Yet, simple as it i, however, it requires
much diligence -and perseveramw; bu it
most amply repays the labor, in the larg
er produce of the corn, besides alfording
to horses, a wholesoume and renovating
diet; for they are remarkably fond of the
assel of the corn, while green and juicy.
The tassel should not lie pulled out of the
corn, all at the same time, but, as the
smaller stalks approach maturity; nor
should they be pulled out too much in a
cluster, if promiscuously.
I have tried this plan, experimentally,
both in the garten, and in the field: au1d
invariably found it of advantage. It is
peculiarly beneficial to corn in uev ground,
.for the reasons above stated, that it has a
greater tendency there, to run too much to
stalk and if generally practiced, will be
found of great utility
Soilfor the cultwe of Cotton.-At a
meeting of the A.siatic Society, Mr. Solly
read a report on the chei-al examina
tion of a series of soils from some of the
principal cotton plmtations of Georgi;-,
which had been procured by Viscount
Palm.:rston, tit the request or the commit
tee of commerce and agriculture cf the so
ciety. .The examination of these soil.,
was undertaken with a view to ascertain
some of the circtitmtances found to lie
most favorable to the cultivition of cotton
in Georgia, and thus indicatina the best
manner of improving the culti- ution of
cotton in India. Mr. Soly stnted th..t.
in order to resider a comparison of thi
kind of any practical value, ii waa aho
lutely necessary to take into account a
variety of circumstances cotinecteil with
the nature of the climates of the countri'n
so cornpared.-such as the limits of tern
perature, the rapidity of evaporation, the
form of the surfitcee of the cotuntry, tbe ra
diting power-o the soil, the retenttive
power for water, and matany oilier points.
These were all of the utmost tmportane

situation would be excellenit fur the cubti

be totall tdlit. The result of the chemi

ing, that the goodness or the soils fromt
Georgia depended pr-obably far-more on

PROPOSALS
FOh REVIVING THE
Southern Review.
T HE Subscriber, in propositg the re-es
tablislineut ol the Southern CViLW, I
luems it uuuecessauy to refer to the history ofI
that work, which is alread) in tue possession of'
the punihc,or to dwell on the high estimation in
which it was held both at home aid abroad. du
ring the period of its countinuance. ' Sutfice it
tu say, that its career, though brief, was, as all
admit, brilliant-creditable to the bouth and to
the wiiole American Union. Is failure-the
subject of universal regret-was owing, it is
weil known. not to a destitution of talent and
public spirit, but arose 1st, from its limited cir
eulation, which was by no means adequate to
sustain a work of such magnitude, and 2ndly,
from the political differences which agitated the
country about the time of' its discontinuance,
dividirig the friends of Southern Literature in
to two great parties. and preventing that har
miony of opinion and co-operation in the dis
cussion of' leading questions, which is desirable
in a work professedly devoted to the cause of
the South and the whole South.
It is proper to con:ider first, the utility of
Reviews, regarded as organs of the literary spi
rit and opinions of the age, andisecondly, the
itilportaice and necessity of establishing such
- work at the South. at the present time. On
the first point, it is scarcely necessary to say
much, in the present advanced stage of period
ical literature. Ably conducted Reviews are
the offspring of a high state of civilization, and
are the best evidence, now-a-days, that can be
furnished of intellectual advancement, and the
prevalence of a pure and elevated philosophy.
Tlhe last half century has produced few au
thors of eminence, either in Great Britain or
America, in comparison with the half c. ntury
that preceded it, and the reason probably is, not
that there has been a want of genius. talent and
scholarship in this confessedly intellectual age.
but simply because distinguished scholars have
found a readier and a better organ through
which to act directly on the public mind in Re
views, than through the medium of books-the
old more tedions and more expensive method.
If therefore, it be asked, what evidence is or
can be furnished of the superior intelligence
and progress of the present cetury-a pro
gress of which we are so apt to boast-the re
ply is that it is to be tboud ii, the high character
of the .4uarterly Reviews abroad and at home.
If it be affirmed, that we have no native liteia
ture in this country, and therefore no materials
to furnish the - round work for Reviews, the an
Rwer is. that our Reviews constitute our native
literature, and that if learning and scholarship
are sought for, they are to be found in our Re
views, which therefore should be warmly and
firmly sipported, as an evidence. and a fair one,
of our literary pretenslous and our national
character. Besides, no one cause, it may be
safely affrmed, has contributed so much to eli
rit talent, to awaketn literary ambition. and to
produce the highest order of fine and powerful
writing, as the estiblishnent of Iteviews; and
ma':v iudividuals have been stimulated to ex
traodinary efforts. and have been subsequently
known far and wide to fame, iii consequence of
-he olportnmities they have enjoyed and impro
ved, ot contributing successfully to works of so
influential and highly respectable a charactei
individuals, who, otfierwise, in all probabilitv.
would never have been tempted to test their
strength on the literary arena with such conpet
itors as they would be' likely to meet there.
The great ain of Reviews is, to discuss sub
jects learnedly,thoronghly,profoundly-in such
a waniier as to bear upon the whole social sys
tem. and pro-uce a broad. deep and permanent
impression upon the general character of a peo
ple: In one word, their object is to diffuse
knowledge, not to foster prejudices-to create,
direct and control-not to echo opinions-to
produce beneficial changes upon a large scale
-not to perpetuate or even tolerate existing a
huses. It is obvions, therefore, that while, in
the infancy of American literature, a spirit of
indulgence has been felt and extended to the
fhimits of onr lighter periodicals, which are rap
idly issued from the pri'ss, and which have
set ved a-s vehicles often for the attempts of the
iiere literary debutant, Quarterly Reviews,
heaviig higher aims to ncconmplish. and intend
ing to represent and embod y, in the most pow
erful and attractive form, the opinions only of
the most enlightened ominds shoutlid be con
tiucted with a scrupulous regard to the pure'st
pincipl-es of taste, mind to the elevation and ad-.
vancement of our literary aid national char
liter.
In respect to thme importance and necessity of
-talishig such a work at the South at the
present time, there can be little doubt in the
mrinds5 of' our discerning atid public spirited
ilizens. We must have stuch a work, or f'all
behind the spirit of' the age, which is of-a pre
rminently ingitisitive and enterprising chiarac
ter. and the South should have such a work,ntt
anly from motives ofliterary p ride and emutla
ion, in order to keep pace with thme respectable
idvances of'the either wide, intelligent, and thri
ring sect ionis of the American republic, but afso
be'ause the South has. at the present period es
pcially, cert ain greatand-lending interests of
,ts own to promote, which can be most effectnm
div siibserved through the instrunmentaelity' of'
mteh a periodical. It is not necessary' to raise
he war cry againist other portions of ihe Uniotn
who may 'feel disposed, as 'hey often do, to dif
er from ius in their views of ocur agricultural,
oiuerciael and political interests, buit it is im
portant, highgly so, that we should take our
touthern positotn firmly in the present attitude
af eur national aiahirs: that our position should
be clearly known and umderstood, both at honie
iud abroad; that we should be ready to defend
rslves and our institutions from Iall covert or
peni asaults; that we should maintain the prin
ples of'the Federal Constttiton in its ongiu
al initention, with a firm and unflinching spirit,
ad promote the cause of' a pure and elevated
iterature by all the' inducements that can he
elucd out to sftiniulate the ambition and pride of
intelligent and chivalric people.
Propositions hiave' heen frequenatly made here
tofore for the re-vival of the Southern Review,
which anfortutnately have noet been crowned
with the success that was hoped or anticipited
orithem. Different causes have been assined
or the failure of~these pro-ects, but the lendinig
sne undoubtedly' is, the neglecting to avail our
eeles of' .a very ravor-ablo state of thte pnblic
reeling by following up well digested plans
with vigorous and concerted action, We have
at ttill-f'olded our hands and closed outr eyes,
and then have complained of universal apathy.
[t is believed, that at the present mnoment,a veiny
deep, general and earnest desire pervades the
Southern communitv. or at any rate, the most
influential portion ofit, to re-establish andi placo
on a perimanetnt foundation, a Qutarterly Review
of the highest order. If' the sibscribcer can en
list this'feelinig in his behalf, he will have rea
son to anticipate the most flattering success
otherwise his efforts will be vaiti.
It is proposed that each number of the con
templatedl work shall containi at least two hun
dred and fifly octavo pages of'original matter.
printed in the best style of the Amnericani press.
Twenty-five kntdrcd or three thousand sub
scribers at five dollrnra atnutalhy, the money be
ing ptaid, wonld yield an amunit sutllicient to
establish the' wor'k, and aff'ord a handsome re
muneration to writers for literary labor. A
strong appeal is made to the public spirited
citizens of'the South. and also efthe West and
South West, already united to us by strong ties
in a commercial aud agricultural point of viewv
-in behalf of' the proposed work. -

will stand at the same time and places with the
Jack. and will be let to mares at the same rates,
and be managed by the saime groom. Any

PEDIGREE.-Young President was got by
Old President. of Kentucy, nad came out of a
Janaus mare. Old President .hy Hlamiltonian.
and he by the imported Diomedoe. The blood
of the sir'e and dama are both so well knowna by
the community at large that I deem it unnece
sary to say any thinag more tabout thea b'ood ona
