We take the following account of the
recent College Exhibition in Columbia
from the Temperance Advocate?and are
absolutely horrified at our friend's want

U! gUllUIMl J I
the college exhibition.
Our readers will find below a programme
of the exercises. We attended the
first night, and was pleased to see the
Chapel crowded?the Ladies?
Nature's last, best and noisiest gift to
' man, j
constituting a large and far the most
lovely portion of the audience. We
iould rather say spectators, for there
was really no audience, if that word is derived
from the Latin, audio, to hear. Be
that as it may, the ladies were there in
beautiful abundance, but
' '' Oh what a row, what a racket and a rioting"
some of those nimblc-tongued damsels did
make; aided and abetted?and but for
the incredibility of the thing, we should
say, surpassed?by divers nondescripts
dress .*d in the masculine habit, but whose
line, flowing tresses and feminine tongues
might lead one to imagine that they were
Teally girls, dressed up in breeches, who
;had gone down there to playoff*a pleas.ant
hoax. If so, they succeeded admirably,
for we verily believe that fully half
.of the spectators took them for bona fide
xjoun gviuen.
<4J|f the merits of the speeches, this dejponent
saith not; but would refer the cu.

of the Faculty, who had read them be*

We except, however, the Latin speech,
to which the ladies really listened with
profound attention.
We would respectfully suggest to the
faculty to have all tho speeches in the
lingua Romana at these Exhibitions, for
t?t has ail the charm of a secret to Eve's
fair daughters, and if they don't find it

The case of McLeod.?This case w
called on Monday morning May 17
before the Supreme Court of the State
New York, before which court thepriso
er was brought in obedience to a writ
Habeas Corjms.
Mr. Bradley of Counsel for McLeo
read the Sheriffs return to the writ, st
ting that the Sheriff held the body
A. McLeod in custody by order of tl
Oyer and Terminer bearing date Man
30th, 1841 on the arraignment of McLei
for murder, and that McLeod was also
custody on a writ of capias ad satisfactie
duin at the suit of William Wells in i
action of trespass for burning and carryii
a certain steamboat named the Carolii
for which he had laid his damages
$30,000, and that the writ contained i
order that he should be held to bail in tl
sum of $7,000.
The civil suit against McLeod h
been discontinued. The Pi isoner's cou
sol then read an Affidavit of McLec
which states the facts with regard to t!
occupation of Navy Island by a body
rrten composed principally of citizens
the United States, having designs hosti
to the British Government in Canada, ai
i . i .1 r_ _
supplied wun arms anu provisions ire
the United Slates?that the Stea
Boat Caroline was engaged in thus su
plying them, and was destroyed by ord
of the public military authorities of Ore
Britain, in Canada?that Durfee, tl
person with whose murder the prisoner
charged, was killed, by the persons e
gaged in executing this order, and whi
so engaged, that the Government of Gre
Britain has assumed us its own the act
destroying the Boat with the killing
said Durfee, and that the Federal Gcvcr
inent of the United States has made d
mand upon the British Government f
reparation therefor, and that negotiatio
j relative thereto are yet pending. T!
Affidavit further states that McLeod vv
not one of the company that destroy*
the Caroline, nor was any way concern*
j in tint Rt in the killing of Durfee.
11 lk The prisoner's counsel then read v
I Jy '
?
p. rious public documents to sustain the ab
Df legations of the Affidavits,
a When the counsel for the prisoner had
y read all the papers he considered necessad
ry, Mr. Wood, of counsel for the people,
?> stated the grounds of the demurr, which
are as follows.
s* 1. Because the attack on the steamboat
Caroline, a boat owned by a citizen of the
'? United States, unconnected with the Ints
surgents of Navy Island, and navigating
the waters of the Niagara river, under a
license from the United States government,
and engaged for aught that appears
in a legal business, was made whilst she
was moored at Schlosser, in the State of
gg New York, and without the jurisdiction
1(j of the Province of Upper Canada.
^ 2. Because, neither the Governor of
re Upper Canada nor Col. Allan McNab
l(j had any right, power or authority to send
or men into this State to destroy the boat;
t0 and all those acting under such unlawful
orders are individually responsible for
frt their acts.
e# 3. Because Amos Durfee, for the murder
of whom the prisoner stands indicted,
jn was a peacable citizen of the United
e< States, and within the jurisdiction of this
j,, State, unconnected with the insurgents
on Navy Island, guilty of no offence arg
gainst the laws of this State or of the
United States, nor against the rights of
*( ( ' O # v O
Great Britain and was killed upon the
main land in this State, after having left
the boat and flying unarmed and unresisting
from the assailants, after they were in
possession of the boat; and the assault
upon whom the prisoner was neither directly
or necessarily connected with the
destruction of the Caroline, was necessary
to the defence of the territories of Great
tlrilain nor f Via npo+ontinn nf hpf Sllhiftr.ts.
VI ?! UV! IIIV ^1 V/IV/V/??'/?? w? ??w. ,
4. Because the matters set forth in the
allegations of the prisoner do not tend to j
establish that the prisoner was exempt from ,
the arrest, nor that the commitment or '
detention are or have been illegal, but
t that the same, so far as they are pertinent
to the issue between the people and the
prisoner apply exclusively to the question
of his guilt or innocence, which is not
now before the court.
5. Because it appears by the Sheriffs
return that the prisoner is imprisoned and
detained on an indictment of murder to
which he has pleaded not guilty, and the
court cannot investigate the truth of such
indictment or plea.
Mr. Hall then informed the Court that
as he had not expected the question on
the discharge of the prUoncr to come up
this morning and was not prepared on the
general merits of the case. He therefore
requested until this morning for time to
more particularly examine the question.
The further hearing of the case was
then adjourned to this morning.
The following are the points made for
the prisoneron the Habeas Corpus.
The attack and destruction of the Caroline
was an act of public force done by
the command of the British Government.
Alt that the prisoner did in it, if any thing |
he did by command of his superior officer
and in obedience to his own government.
For acts done under such authority he is I
not responsible personally or individually
in any court of law whatever.
2. The Supreme Court has jurisdiction
to try the offence charged in the indictment
and may order it to be tried at bur.
R' It has jurisdiction therefore to give advice
and grant leave to the District Attorney,
L* to order a nolle prosequi upon the indictment.
3. The right to enter such nolle prosequi
previous to the enactment of the re- j
vised statutes, was alone vested in the
District Attorney, or Attorny General. !
It was then and now the exercise of the
executive power of the government infls
fluence J by considerations of sound policy
^ and wise expediency. The same reasons
-, which would induce the law officer of the i
0 | government to interpose to prevent a trial
n* j ought to and will induce the Court toad?'
vice and allow the same thing to be done.
4. Redress for this forcible and hostile
d, invasion of the territory of the U. S., the
a- destruction of property and the killing of
of our citizens, was at an early day demandlie
ed of the British government of the Uni;h
'ed States, and the whole matter is still
kJ in the course of treaty between them,
;n with a view to a full and just settlement.
Um The State of New York therefore cannot
discreetly or lawfully interpose its jurisdiction
and take cognizance of any portion
of this public offence against the entire
American nation. It is the exercise
a of an authority by the State repugnant to
in the constitution and laws of the U. S. and
'ie brings the two jurisdictions in collision
and conflict. Its tendency is to thwart
as the constitutional exercise of the treaty
n- making power of the U. S., and thus iu>d,
voire the two countries in war.

m The act in which McLeod is alleged
to have participated being an exercise of
the public force of Great Britain* and of
a hosiile character, becomes the subject of
cr reclammation, reprisal and war on the
at part of the government of the United
States, as it shall see fit ; or it may dels
mand acknowledgment, reparation or inn*
deranity for the offence and injury and
ile thereupon acknowledge itself satisfied,
at Any interference of the State authority
of will be and is incompatible with the exof
ercise of these high powers.
n. 6. If the alleged offence were cognizable
by the Courts of the United States,

The publication of a paragraph that
General Jackson had become greatly em*

elicited the following contradiction from
his adopted son:
Nashville, April 22nd, 1841.
It may not he improper for me to add
here that the rumor so industriously prop*
agated, representing Gen. Jackon's estate
as insolvent, is entirely unfounded. From
my personal knowledge ot his pecuniary
affairs, I can say with confidence, if he
was called upon to-morrow to close his
liabilities, that his estate, worth at least
$100,0110. would not diminish a fraction.

pilatka, may 12.
Information reache 1 here of rather a
favorable nature for the South; it is re.
ported that Coa-coo-chee on the 29lh ult.
came in to Fort Pierce with 10 warriors.
After a day or two sojourn, he went out
and returned on the 4th inst. with twenty-five
of his men, supposed to be all of
the warriors he has control of, he profess,
ed friendship and a desire to emigrate.
News reached here to-day from the West
that Alleck Tustenuggee had sent into
Tampa Bay, saying he would be in soon.
All this looks fair enough. Per contra.
The Indians in the neighborhood of
Paine's Prairie, some days since, have

Every thing is quiet. We have no
Indian news. The probability is, that
the Indians are busily engaged tending
their crops. Wild Cat has sent word to
the General that he will be in, and trusts
that his influence with the Southern Tnrfi.
ans will not prove unavailing. If he suecoeds
in influencing Hospatakitoa favor,
able consideration of the General's overtures,
all may yet be well?if not) the war
must goon. It cannot have escaped your
observation, that throughout all of the
negotiations, (past and yet pending,) I
have maintained that no reliance, at least
to a serviceable extent, could be placed
upon the word of the enemy. For maintaining
and expressing this opinion, your
friends have called me to an a&count.
Your own remarks have also had that ten*
dency, Now look at the matter. The
take the prisoner in at the window from
the carriage in which she was brought
from the prison. Judge Barton's remarks
i to the prisoner previous to passing the
sentence were quite eloquent, but the unhappy
object of them moved not a muscle
during their delivery, and not until
the last words of the awful sentence fell
from his lips did she yield to her feelings.
She then fainted, and was thus, uncon.
scious, carried to an adjoining office where
she suffered many similar spasms, and
wept without stint or remorse. Her husbaud,
under arrest on a similar charge
was by her side and exhibited great mental
agony.
This is the second capital sentence passed
upon a woman since the American revolution?and
but two female executions
are within the oldest recollection. The
first, while Pennsylvania was a province,
was at Chester. The brother of the victim
upon that occasion had succeeded
in obtaining her pardon from the Executive
Council, but failed to reach the place
of execution before she was swung off.
The second was that of a young German
female, near Germantown, for the murder
of two of hei own children, a great many
years ago. It is very doubtful whether
the third female execution will ever take
dtid an indictment had been found in
sticH Court, the ground of discharge
wduld hrite been the same then as now.
If then the United States Courts ought to
forbear to persecute the individuals, so
ought now the Stale of flew York. '
8. The foregoing are believed to be
the sound views of the subject and Mtisfactorily
show that this Court should (lis.
charge the prisoner.

Young ladies who may wish to procure
flowers enough for a nosegay must rise
early this morning or they may not find
a supply. Flowers are scarce are just at
this time. If they will rise half an hour
after daylight and look half an hour in
an easterly direction they may chance to

SUMMARY.
MARRIAGE.
When a man of sense comes to marry,
it is a companion whom he wants, and not
an artist. It is not merely a creature
who can paint, play, dress and dance?
it is a being who cau comfort and console
him.
A Mr. Howell, of Cumberland, Mary
land, whose father was a passenger on
board the rresiaent, received oy me nnt.
tannia, a letter from a relative who resides
in Southampton, England, dated
April 19th, stating that the President had
arrived at Madeira: that Mrs. Power, the
wife of Tyrone Power, had just received
bv Express, information to that effect.
This is the most hopeful account yet received.

"I am not an Irishmau myself," said a
stump orator recently, while harranguing
a political meeting in the West, where
the majority of hearers were Irishmen?
"I am not an Irishman myself, I say, but
I cau safely assert that my ancestors,
on both the paternal and maternal side,
were extremely partial to the Irish character.
Indeed, I can go so far as to say
that I had an aunt who was extremely fond 1
of Irish potatoes."?(Cheers.)
