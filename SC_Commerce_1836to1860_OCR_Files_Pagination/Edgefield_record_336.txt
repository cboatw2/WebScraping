Whom was referred st) much of the Governor'
Message, as relates to the controversy between
tie 1ates otGeorgia and V ane, with the ac,
companyin& Documents have had the saein
under consideration, and beg leave to submi1
the following Report:
. In May, 1137. a slave, named Atticns, the
property of James Sazurs and Henry Saurs,
cstizens of the city of Savannah. in Clntintin
county, in -the State of Georgia, was conveyed
from ihat State to the State if Maine, by Dan.
iel Philb'rook and Edward Kileran, citizew ol
the latter State: the former of whom was the
Master. and the latter the mate of the schoener
Boston, which had recently entered the port of
Savannah. On the 16th of Juie, or the same
year, information on oath was made before a
Magistrate of Chatham county. by James Sa
gurs, one of the owners of the slave, that Dan
el Philbrook and Edward Killeran "did, on or
about .the fourth day of May last, feloniomsly
inveigle, steal, take and carry away without
the limits of the State of Georgia," the slave
Atticus; "that. the said Daniel Philbrook and
Edward Killeran have been guilty as the depo
neat is informed and believes. of a felony un
der the laws of this State," and 'that since the
commission of said felony, the satidPhilbrook
and Killeran have Bed fromn this State, and are,
as he believes, at this time. within the limits of
the State of Maine, in the United State.'."
A warrant fir the arrost of Philbrook and Kil
.eran, was issued by the Magistrate before whoim
the miformatioa was inade, on the sa:ime thay, to
which, the officer charged with its execution,
returned that they were not to be found in the
founty of Chatham.
On the 21st of the same month, Iis Excellen
cy, William Schley, Governor of the State of
Georgia, made a demand upon His Excellency,
Robert P. Dunlap. Governor of the State of
Maine. of Philbrook and Killeran, as fimi'ives
from the justice of Georgia. charged of feloni
ously inveigling, stealing. taking and carrying
away, a slave, and transmitted with his d--ma:id.
a copy of the affidavit and warrant, and the re
turn, duly authenticated. On the 16th of An -
gust, of the saine year. Governor Dutlap ad
tressed to Governor Schley, a communmcation,
in which he declined to cause the arrest of Phil.
brook and Killeran. .
In December, 1837, the Legislature of Geor
gin, adopted resolutions. declaring the refusal of
the Executive of Maine to surrender Philbrook
end Killeran, dangerous to the righis of the
people of Georgia, and directly aud clearly in
violation of the plain letter of the Constitution
of the United States: that the State of Georgia
became a party to the Federai Constitution no
less for the better protection of her own, than
the common rights and inter-sts of all, and that
when these end. are defeated, she is released!
from the obligations of that compact. and it has
bec tie ier :411 and her ditty. to provide pro
tection for her people in her own wayt that
when an indictment should be found against
Philbrook and Killeran, the Executive be re
quested to renaw the demand for their arrest,
and ifthe demand be arain refused by the Exe
Putive of Maine. that icony of its risolution
be transmitted to the Executive of each State in
the Union.to be laid before their resper tive Le
gislatures; tha a copy be transumitted to the Pre.
gident of the United States. and to tie Senitors
and Representatives of Georgia, in Comgtess.
to be submitted to that body; and if the Legis
lature of Maine. at its next Session, aller thos
resolutions should have been forwarded bj the
Executive of that State, neglect to redreas the
grievance complained of, then. that the Exec-t
tive of Georgia announee the ?ane by procla
tra'ion, and call a Coivention of 'hr Peo.le. to
take into cotsideration t,.e state of the -om
monwealth of Georgia, and to devise tie coirie
ofi her future policy , and to provide all necessa
ry iafeguards for the protection of the rights of
her people.
O tie 7th of February, 183i, an indictment.

In reply to the demand of Governor Schmlej
Nis Excellency,Governmor Dunlap, suggests thal
Philbmook and Killern visited the city of Sa
vannah, sn thme comure of thmeir business as Ma,
riers, and returned to their domicil in- Maiii
by the custoipary route, and in thme usual time
thast they abided at their residence withiiun
concealment, and demeaned thmeimelves as tnm
suspecting and innocent cituzens., and inuisu
that it may well be called ia question wvhethiei
snob a co'mrse of tonduettt eatn be regarded ai
*fleeing from jUstice, and they as "faigitives,'
within thme meaninig of thme Constitution.
JA Ma)itis-trather surgeuIed thtan made
your zaenige wiU procee t* a hrps exam
intion of the-graunds on which the refsal to
mntrender the fugitfes, is supposed to be jus
tified.
The first _1aindtakiihy Governor DiNliap,
pssutnes; that the -afidavit submitted to him,
does not specify the fact of which the imputed
felony is prediea:ed. but merely suggests the
coisnmion of a felony, without enabling His
Excellency to determine, whether it aimed at
the suliversion or the Government, or affected
the lire liberty or property of iidividual citi
zens, and that there is no specification of dine,
place or the manner of its commision. The
second ground iN. dat the commission of the
larceny, is not positively charged, but that the
larceny, is believed by the deponent to have
been comnitted; and maintains that such as
affidavit would not authorize a Magistrate to
issue his warrant of arrest, or justify the de ten
tion of an individual for trial.
Yourcoammittee cannot well conceive that an
allidavit so clear in its specification of the par
ticular offence-even with the minuteness with
which the statute of .Georgia defines it,-and
so direct and positive in charging the alleged
fugitiv-s with its perpetration, could have
been the subject of mistake or misconception.
Its lnguage is positive and explicit, that they
"did feloninunily inveigle, steal, take and carry
away"thw slave and not that the deponent had
been informed, br believed they had done so.
The legal propositions insisted on by His Ex
cellency. the Governor, in the grounds oi which
his refusal is put. appear to your committee to
be as untenable,ns the assuneption offact in both,
is gratuitous and palpable.
All who have the slightest knowledge of
Criminal Law, cannot but be aware, that pre
cisiona of statement. and piatficularity of aver
ment.do not constitute requi.ites of any process
or proceeding, that seeks nierely the arrest, or
detention of one suspected of crime, but that
infonnationon oath that a crime has been actual
ly committed, andi that there is cause and proba
bilitv of suspectint the party against whom the
warrant is prayed is all that is usually, or can
be legally, required.
Whatever opinion may be entertained of the
sufficiency of the affidavit, or of the nature of
the objections raised by Governor Dunlap, his
successor Gov, Kent, admits, that the grounds
of nis predecessor's refusal are removed by the
indictment ounutd, a copy of which accompanied
the second demand which was made by Gov
ernor Gilmer.
le admits that the copy of the indictment
found, 'for stealing a man alleged to be a
slave." as he is pleased to designate the charge.
is sutlicient evidence that the alleged fugitives
from the justice of Georgia are charged with a
crime. but sees no evidence that they are figs
tives from justice; and when their arrest is de
ded as a right, claim: , 'rthe Executive of Maine,
the right to be satistied of the existence of this
fact, as (e -if the conditions of the demand.
He suggests-a doubt, whether an accusation
or charge must not have been made before the
flight, to authorize the demand, and fels bit
ilttle doubt, that such was the chief intention of
those who framed our Eoderal Cuuotitution.
Is tae demaad a right? The right of a For.
eign State or Kingdom, independent of treaty
stipulations to require the surrender, on de
mnand, or those who have committed crinmes
in another Country. is a proposition, of which
iany distinguished writers on public law,
nanitain the adirmative. and some with equaI
ciaims to consideration,the negative. But what
ever may be the right amongst Foreign Nations.
all concur that the impolicy of afrording an
asylum, and a refuge to fugitives from justice
of othor States, is undeniable. It is believed
tha: most, if not all Pereign States. that have
established commercial relations wids others,
have thought tit to provido for their security in
this regard.
When it shall be remenbered. that our Feder
i Government, in its treaty with Great Oritains
in 1794. stipulated expresly for this right; that
he Constitition or the U,,*J9. --
tended -to form a more perfect Union. establish
justice, anl ensure domestic tranquility" be
tween cointicuous States; and that-that iastrn
ment imperatively declares the fugitive "shall.
on demand, be delivernd,''your Committee can
not perceive, the propriety. with which the right
can be questioned.
That the suggestion, whether an accusation
or charge should not h'ave been mnadt,baefore the
flight of the offender, to authorize the demand.
and require tiae surrender, is detitnte of all
claim to even plausibility, your Committee will
not pmnase to demonstrate.
Can. th!ean, the r,-fusal to cause thae arrest and
surrender of Philbrook and Kilteran, tinid .;us
mitiation in the iauficiency of the testimony.
to establish the fact that they had fled from the
instice o.f Georgia ?
'Your Commmiee arc of opinion that some
evidence- of Is flight shaould accomanty the de
mand oif a fugitive froan justie, so that it may
'aper, !hat thu party demnanded, has departed
withotut ha~vitng responded to the impuited crime,
or endured its punishment an the Btate. w-hoae
laws are alleged to have beetn violated, but thaey
cannot entertain a doubht, that anerely prima
facie evidensce uf the fact. is all that irr any case
casn be rqaired, or in most cases could be pro
daued. ' nat the flight was with the motive
or purpose to evade punishameu or. to eliadu,
justice, is a rait thant as suasceptiile of.only pre
satanltive proof, anad rarely could be otherwisse,
est lishd. than by proof, thnt a crime had been
com'titted, and thtat its perpetrator land gone
without the limits of the State, having jursdic
tion of the office. Baut the affidavit charges thae
light ofthaese indaviduals, dirtecly and positive
ly, a d receives comnfrmation' from thereturn
of the officer. charged with the executtion of
thec war'rat.t in the county of Chatam. The
Contitttion, and the Act of Congress. in pro
viding for the arrest atnd removal of fuagimaves
from'jnmstice, intends summnary and ministerial
procedings, and does niot contemnplate judicial
investigationa for neucertaimment of the lugitives'
gailt. The evidlence wvhich shall accoma paty
the demand.is prescribed by ahe Supreme Lw.
It is ititeuded to show prima facie, that the party
is guiltv, thsat there is probable cause to be
ieve hiin guilty, auc'h as would upon a warrant
jstify his commitment for trial.
If thia ho the paurport and effect of the evi
dece, ini the form prescribed, it appears to youmr
Committee that the righst to dematnd the re
moval of a fugitive, is undheaisble..and the duty
to cause the arrest and surrender, imperative.
Your Commnittee will not hitre. refrain fromt
allnsion to a fact which may afford sonme illus
tratioan of the course which the Executive anad
Legislte Depaartmetst of Maine, huave rien
it to puarsue. in respect to the demands which
have beena ntade, of the surrender of thme alleged
fuitives fromr the justice of Georgia. A fter the
r-usal of Governor Dunlap and after the' net ion
of the Leszislasture of Georgiaoan the subject, the
Legislature of Maine enacted a Law, that when
the surrender of a fugitive rrom iustice shall be
deantded of the Executive of that State, "and
the Govertior shall he satisfied, on investigation
of the grounds of such demamnd, and that the
samo is madle conformably to law. and ought to
be complied with, he shall issue his warrant
namler the seal of the State atuthorizing the a
gent who shoald snake such demand, either
forthwith or at such time a.- shall he deusignasted
inthas warratit, to take and transport such offena
der to thes line of this Stnte."
. That this statute intends by the Executive
Departmei.t of Maine, inquiry into thme guilt
of the fugitive, and a deteranination of the ex
pediency of ordering his surrender whether he
e innocent or gutilty, although denanded coni
formably to law, its termt, as welhl as its history,
may well render probtable. 'Ifthis 'he .its just
nterpretation, well inay'-the Governeta of
Maine, call thme rightuo demand a fumgitive4'rom
jattice, a question.:
right omke the demand tnipaired by the
statute, it will be perceived, that the warrant ot
arrest must be executed by the ageut ofthe State
.whose:Chisf quagist -'ies the demand,
ani that the Governor ofdaine, may authorize
the arresiteither forthwith, or at sucli times, as
may be designated in the warrant. The difli
:ulties which such agent-would at any time
experience, inmnking an arrest, in a -Foreign
Jurisdiction, especially with a warrant designa
tiug a remote day for is execution. added to the
chances of escape which ;t holds out, would,
in most cases, make it utterly impracticable
However incompatible with the Supreme Law,
your Committee may deem this Statute ut
Maine, illustrated as it is by the conduct of her
Executive Department, they are constrained to
regard it, as indicating the settled determina
tion of that State, that no citizen of tiers, shall
ever answer in a Sonthern tribunal, for an
offence againat the right to certain property. to
which'her FOLICY aa exp., are most cordi
ally hostile.
The facilities which tho Federal Constitution
affords to citizens of the United States. who
are inimical to slavery, of abducting and inveig
lingalaves from their ownera. and the temptation
to embrace those facilities, which is suggested
by such impunity, as the authorities of Maine
have provided for her citizens. presents a con
juncturg; which the least timid, and the most
prudent amongst us, may well deem full of peril
to the rights of the Sounth. When the salb
guards ofthe Federil Conttitution shall be
come ineffectual and illusory, then indeed. the
period has arrived, when the States of the
South must take care that their citizens sustain
no detriment. Let us tell our brethren of the
North mildly. but resolutely,- that if they did
introduce slavesamongst us against our remon
strance, they shal not remove them against our
consent, and that whilst we tolerate no im
pairment ofour title to our .property, in the
IalIs of the FederalLegislature, we will, also.
pemit rao State to convert itself into a city of
refuge for those who invade it as .felons.
Yottr Committee recommend the adoption of
the following Resolutions:
Reslred, That it in the duty. an well as the
right, of any Stae. to insist on the faithful ob
servance or the Federal Constitution, by each
State in the Union.
Resolved, That to defire crimes and felonies
within its; jurisdiction, is an incident to the sove
reignty ofeach State, and that no other State
can question the exercise of that right.
Resolred, That to demand the surrender and
removalpf fugitives from justice. is,by the Con.
stitution, a right;and the arrest and surrender a
dutv: that the denial or impairnient of this right,
is i'nconsistent with the constitutional obliga
tions of a State, and subversive of the peace
and good government ofthe other States.
Resolved, That the right has. been impaired,
if not denied. by the authorities of Maine, and
that this State w ill neverconsent, that Iny State
shall become an asylum for those who are fugi
tives from the justice of other States.
Resoleed. That this State will make common
canse with any State of this Coufederary, in
mintaining its justzights, under the guaranty

Mr. Clay, of-Kentuicky,. esented the i
memorial -of a comnmittee of tie Ank-rican I
Silk Society, prayinit the aid and natron
age of' the Gov'ertnineft -tn. printtig and I
distributing the journal ifaid soci'ty.
In presentiing this memofial M1. Cla yi
saidi. whiile I am~ up. I-will.remnark hat, in
my opinion,, there is hardly _a prd'uction .
in which this country is engaged whichr
s more important to he dtly atten'ed to,
t this dime than that of silk.. Asten amg
rieniural product it is appropriate to all
parts of the cotintry. And amnog the r
causes which have occasioned theuniex
ap1led state of distress from wich no e
ptrtiont 'if this wide~ country is (emipi,
which has increased, is increasing andI I
wishto God I tould see any hop, of its
end--at least among the foreigieauses ti
of thi,. remanikable state of distres is un- ii
questionably thnt of purchiasing a much t<
abroadt. Sir we must make moe at o
home and bring less from abrosi if we ti
would remove the causes of ilisits: and ti
this remark is appllicable to our en pro- p
dictionis in every form, of A~ricture as n
well of fabricationi. And in regar. tn silk tin
itself look at the facts. For seve I years fc
past the annual amount ol' it brothu into p
this couintry has been 812,500.ID, and o
one year it rose to $20,000.000; ad this Ii
12,500,000 is for an article whic if any p
thing is for tho adornment and aury of a
maim, silk is that article. -S
Sir, no counitry can long stand. I wvhich 04
the antual itmports exceed the'xports e:
some 40 or 50 millions of dollars. And if w
I was not ahsotntely piowerlest if mny to
friends and myself had any pow in thme pi
direction tfahis Government, I mId to- fr
morrow impose a duty eqtualtot m axi- w
mumtt which the compromise a admtits a
that is, '20 per cent. on this imponf$12,- ti
500.000 in silk. I wvould' lay thduiy otn gi
silk, and with a view, in psrt, tprevent it
a dangerosts excess of revenue, woumld ih
distrilute the anual proceeds cue sales til
of thie public lands to theStates aseir ownt
property, to which they are airly enmi- at
tIed; an'd let this fund assist thero liqu'- am
date their debts, and to foster tee great se
interests which are justly dearn them, og
so far as there is now fireedom n tdebt. Si
I would imipose this duty on uianmd on m
other luxuries, and if the lameare not 'he
necessary to the support of thiiovern- fr,
ment, I'would distribute the peods of us
the lands among the States ulsre en- th
iled to them. But we, or at- k I am re
not in the condlitioni todo what lye stng- to
eted. anid therefore I cannot 'dberwise [,
than in ask that this memorialhferred ar
to the Cotmmiittee on Manufuewr and t,
printed,. . . - - wyl
Mr. Calhiotin said: I rise. to-manio inp- It
positionl to the motion, but to wia few thi
remarks'connected .ith those tdiwhiehn fr
are now of chief importance, si hops,
,a no' much more -of this sen Will ,
pas, before we 'shall go deeply into that
aubject. The country is now.at.a point- at
,lieb'it -has-become of-far more iIierest
than ever. I
bir, I differ in toto from the Senator
from Kentucky a% to the causes of distress;
and, if I am not mistaken, they are the
very opposite ofr what have been suggest
ed. To revive the old, the tried .nd con
demned American system. wold be ruin
ous in every bratich of industry, utnd espe
cially the mani-faciuring, agricultural, and
cemniercial interests. The distress which
he ascribes to the importation of silk,
comes from other causet. He looked up.
on any measure that wtald, at this tinc,
increase the credit of the States so as to
enable them to sell more bonds in foreign
markets, as positively injurious. We
.hip our credit, and bring in goods. I hold
the very reverse of what the Senator has
indicated as true policf, and I hope for an
early opportunity of pointing out that poli
cy, and that at an early day we shall look
deep into the subject.
Mr. Clay. This is a little unusual, to
engage inl a discussion on this subject thus
before the time. Sir. have I proposed ot
suggested -a revival of the tariff further
,than the compromise allows? Not in the
slightest degree. I merely proposed a
duty on silk,as an article of luxury, en
tirely consistent with the compromise.
Sir, what was it that I proposed ? It
was simply that the maximum duty of
the compromise-that is, twenty per cent.
-should be imposed on silk, which is in
'00 way, incompatible with the com
promise.
And how can this injure the manufac
tures of cotton, ship-building, or any thing
else, which are now nearly prostrawed?
'he woollen tnanufaeturer at the North is
almost entirely stopped, and that of irot
itself is aitong the most languishing. How
ran theduty on this'luxury affect either
the manufacturers or agriculture of the
country? It will benefit them; for it will
directly aid the manufacture of silk, and,
if raw silk is produced with su-ccss, it be
comes a fit object for importation. and it
may aid greatly in removing the ruinous
excess in the balance of trade, which will
eruh us all, umiless the people-cnn rime to
teir own relief.
And the State debts? Sir, T shol like
to know by what right the subject of State
debts is so frequently dragged into thi's
Senate, and the States are here chided
and censured as if under our suipervision.
who gives un jurisdiction over them? By
what authority haw we the right to say to
Pennsylvania, or illinois, or any other
State, you are extravagant; you have got
into debt; and we will leave you to get
ut as you can. Whence is this riahi!
Who made it the ihity ofthe Federal Gov
P-rtnent to eive lectures to the States on
geiting .into this dobt? But those debts
have been contracted, and, as the Seoator
rron South Carolina says, one eftert of it
has been to ,nlarge nur imports, because
the means arisine from ih- State hords
has been thrown into tle chauttel of com
rettrce. Bnt it will be no longer so, for
that very means will now become an ob
itruction to commerce. But those debts
exist, and as ien of honor ntd honesty,
hose who ove thtem, mut pay them; and
I trust no tntin here % ill be :-o destituie o
hotor nod - pirbil. nis to say they.oaght
iot to be paid. Tht:v have been con
racted, and our .States have received the
senefit, and .1 trust atid believe tha -inta
Srairn. ,tsl Uuthn "it ne so tost to honfior
&nl good faith as not to pay such deit.
the debts exist, and in the worst forms.
icrause the foreigner is agninst tis, not -s i
t whole, but divided into parts, as separate i
netnbers of tle Confedoratcy, on whom
here is foreign debt; and consequemtly I
hreign infinecte. -
And what is to he done? The States '
itave here proposed ttothing in eit her beranch'
if Congress. Bitt we know stt the ex
stence of these debts. antd the distress I
ich prevails in these different comunit- I
ies; and we know that .taxatioln w-ill be

Mr. Clay. The. gnteniman onnes to i
ai assumptian of the gtare debts. .Why.
sir,..the proposition warmade long before
any state was in debt, or, if any, only for
a trifling sum; and the gentleman says this
ik an assumption of the State debts! But
how? Uin %'hat grounds did I make my
proposition? We are in possession of a
funid belonging to the States, held it trust
soleley for their benefit; and I said we
*.uglt ow to distribute its proceeds among
:he States. And the gentleman says.this
is at assumption of the State debts! Sir
how is it so? And whose is this property?
It will go to the States that owe no debt;
and if those States receive it,they get bely
what they are etlitled to.
In respect to the American System. I
stam ready to engage in the discussion on
that subject; but when I do so, I hope the
honorable Senator from South Carolina
will remember the part he took in 1816,
as the originator of that system; and that
I was then his humble follower on that
Subject, and for years after% ards; and I
believe the country is now fifty years a.
head of what it would have been but thr
that system; and iWit hnd not been for that
system, we should be now in the state we
were before the Revolution, when there
was no paper nor uore currency, except as
tobacco and other -articles of trade were
used us a medium.
I shall then be ready to show that do
mestic causes produced the greater portion
of the dstress in which the country. is in
volved; but of foreigu causes; the main one
has been that we produce too little at
home, ani send for too much abroad: and
I believe the imports are enlarged not
merely by the want of duty on luxuries,
but the liet of free articles is inore than a
a ttoiety of the whole imports of the
country.
Mr. Grundy said, without intending to
declare any opinion on the merits of the
debate in which the gentleman who pre
ceeded hint had engaged, be expressed the
hope that the subject of the assumption of
State debts by the General Government
would not be worn out before it came
properly before the Senate. The Select
Comnmittec to which that matter had been
referred, would, in a few days make a re
port, in which all the questions connected
t ith the subject would fie presented, fully
and fairly, for the action of the Senate,
und every Senator would have art oppor
tunity of presenting his sentiments on
them.
The memorial was then referred to the
Committee on AsManufacttres.

The passage of the Sub-Treasury bill
in the Senate, is the subject on much con
gratulatiou aottng the- iriends of the ad
ntinistration here.- The effict of the tait

Led bolth by its friends.nnt its toes; but it
%%ill certainly tend to restrain the issues of
the local-banks,'as they will be frequently
called on for specie by those who hate
payments to make to the governnent. It
is very certain that it will pass the House.
It has never been doubted by aty one till
withi a clay or two; but now it appears
that the Whigs will not allow it to go by
default, and that they itill take the chan
res of some dissenttion among its friends ii
regard io its details, to defeat it. But op
tosition to it from the Whigs may only
erve te unrit is frands. .

that, until the House otherwise ordered,
the printing should be given out by the

Correspondence of the Southe Patriot,
HOUSE OF :REPRESENTATIVES.
TUEsDAY, Jan.21, 1840.
As soon as ihe journal had been read,
Mr. Proffit asked the indulgence of the
House to submit a resolution calling upow
the Secretary of War, for information a*
to whether Bull Dogs and Blood Hounds
had been ordered for the.Florida Cam
paign.
What object Mr. P. could have in sub
mitting this resolution, I cannot conceive.
He and his party are continually raving
at the alleged impotency of the Secretary;
and yet they are ever on the watch to
pounce upon him on the least apparent
deviation froni the usual mode of warfare.
They say, that he alone is responsible for
the failure, and yet they are constantly in
termeddling t'ith his plans.
The first business in order,.was the res.
olution of Mr. Thotiip-.on. denying the
ricghtof the reception of Abolition papers.
Mr. Garland, of Va., being entitled to
tbe floor. replied at some length to the re
narks of Mr. Slade.
Mr. Butler, of S. C., followed, and is
some very pointed remarks, pinced Mr.
Slade and his associates, in -their true po.
lition. He said that gentlemen were mis
n;'ken-in supposiag the issue was on the
right of petition, the true issue is either
tinion or dis-union and the moment that
(ongress should legislate on Slavery,
hat nomtent the Union would be practic
illy dissolved. Mr B. contended that the
teople of the North were ignorant of the
rue nature of afiturs in the Sutth. He
issured them that ifrthe Southirn Institu.
ions were not-suffered to exist as ihey are,
lie life of every white man and wonaa
ould be endangered.

%by lie and his party of the South, sup.
red the Admini-itration. They (lid so

rilling that the whole surplus revenue
hould lie applied to tuniversal emncnipa
in. Also, that 1836 Gen. Harrison re
used to say whether he was an abolition.
t or not. He adduced many other proofs
fthe Aholition pirincipi.es or Harrison,
bieb could tnot lbe denied, and asserted,
~at sincc the Harrisbutrg nomination, a
ner had been written, asking him to de

Ir. 1l.." lie know~s bietter than to atnswer."
iconclusion, M r. B. said, it had been
iserted that liriso.. was now an actual
ember of atn Abolition Society. After
te e~rpose I wonder if the Whigs will stilt
ave the as,.uran~ce to denty that Harrisom

icrefore cotntended that it was not in or
