THE BLESSED MISTAKE.
The following narrative, recently reported
o the Board of the Cry Tract Society,
very pleasingly illustrates the Divine promise?4,I
will bring the blind by a way that
they know not; I will lead them in paths
that they have not known."
A late miss'onaryof this Society, while
passing through the sircet, was accosted by
n stranger as an olJ acquaintance, and requested
to call and see the family of which
the stranger was a member, and the name
and residence of which were mentioned.?
Although lie had no recollection of having
seen the individual be/ore, he did not name
that circumstance, and as the place and
lamily were resectable, he obeyed the invitation
the next day. He was politely re
coived by the lady of a navai cap:ain, bul
instantly discovered that some error had

About this time the person who had invito

of the missionary having had been mistaker

rd from sea, and consented to accompany
her to & place of worship, flere she was
pleasingly surprised at recognising, in the
l>ersoi) who officiated, the stranger whos?
peculiar visit, on the only previous occasion
of her seeing him, had been mado the
means of her conversion. At the close o
the service she named to her husband the
whole of the circumstances, and the imprcsvou
made on hi* mind was such that he
became concerned to be himself a Cnristian.
He has since experienced the peace
of God the* passcth all understanding, an
as a fellow member now unites with his wife
in commemorating the love of Christ at the
' sacramental board.
Doctrinal Knowledge?The duties ol
Christianity arise out o.' hadoclrincs. There,
fore, properly to understand and appreciate
the former, it ir absolute y necessary thai
the christian have a clear and distinci
acquaintance with the latter. For exam,
pie the duty to repent can never be suitably
felt and thorou?.ily performed, without a
correct hnowledge of ftuman depravity and
~ > - * n . m.
ot actual irangress;ons arising worn it. i ne
duty to worship Curist never can be properly
performed, without an acquaintance
with his character?ms divinity, as well as
his humanity. We ate requireJ to believe
on him in order to salvation : but what shall
we believe on hun as finite or infini e?as
creature or creator ??What has he done
for cur salvation ? Shall we regard him
merely as a teacher sent from God, and as
a viartyr to the truth ; or shall wo trust in
hun as our substitute, standing in our tplace,
meeting the demands of God's law against
us? We must not only understand, who
is, but what he has done.
Again?wo are exhorted to "g~ow in
uruce"?to M follow holiness." But how
d
shall we progress in holiness ? Merely by
reading and hearing the truth, and by our
own exertions ? Or shall we look and pray
for the operations of ihe Holy Spirit ? We
might multiply examples, but these are suffi
ci-jnt to show the importance of doctrinal
knowledge.
If what we tuve said is true, our piety
wiii be as defective or as supeificial as our
acquaintance with the doctrines of the Gospel.
This may account for the superficial
character of the piety of the present day.
But few of the members of our churches
have any thing like a clear discriminating
knowledge even of the most important doctrmes
of the Scriptures. Hence, too, the
troubles in our church.
Bp form in the Church.?Ail cndcav.
ours of reformation in a Cnurch are 01 s ;raOi>
defective when they come short of this
; unely, ;he repentance and conversion
> mat dwell under the shadow of it.
*V 4 i msetii tlmt the eve. of the blind
opened, the ears of the deaf shall
i .siopped, t:ie lame shall leap, thedunib
snail sing, tho parched ground shall be a
pool, the thirsty land springs of water,'(Isa.
xxxv. 5?7. The wolf, ihe leopard,
the lion, the bear the uss, the cockatrice,
shall be so tamed from the fireceness
and malignity of their natures, that, 'tl.;y
shall not hurt nor destroy in all the holy
mountain,' but * a li.tle child shall lead them
all.' (Isa. xi. G, 9.) It is a great huppiness
and advantage to i ve under the shade
of a godly Government. Many men have
reason to bless God all their days, that they
were, in their childhood, trained up in such
a school where pie'y was taught them as
well as ! arning ; that they lived in such a
family, where the master of it was of Joshua's
mind, * I and my house will serve the
Lord,' (Josh, xxiv 15 ) Salvation often
comes to a whole house, when the governor
thereof is converted. (Luke xix 9 ; Acts
xiv. 33, 34.
1 shall never look upon a Church as reformed
to purpose, till I find reformaion
work conversion : till p.ety and charity, i
justice- and humility, gentleness, goodness,
kindness, meekness, singleness of heart, and
zeal for godliness, mutual edification, and
the hie and power of religion are more conspicuous
than before. When the very
headstone w s brought forth, and the last
work in the building of the temple was finished,
yet the people must then cry ' Grace,
grnce it' (Zee!?, iv. 7,) intimating that
reformation is never indeed consummate
t II the blessing cf God make it effectual
unto those uses, for which it was by liirn np.
' pointed. Cnurch reformation should be like
j St. Paul's epistles, which always close in dui
tics of obedience.?Bishop Reynolds.
Forgiveness of injuries?It is wei
known that the Koran of Mahomet con'uin:
many passages copied from the sacred wri
tings. Among others, the Arabian prophe
lias given a place to those precepts of ou
adorable Redeemer, which recommend for.
giveness of injuries, and overcoming cvi
with good. One day the Caliph Hassan
son of Mali, being at dinner, a slave unfor
: tunatciy let fall a dish of meat reeking hcl
; which scalded him severely. The slave fel
; on his knees, exclaiming, in the languagi

] responded the Caliph, " 13nt above all fo

slave. "I set thee at liberty," rejoined th<
\ Caliph, and I give thee ten dinars." Wi
not this Mahometan rise up in judgement
j and condemn many who call themselve

under the power of a merciless and unfor

-| ( THE MEMORY OF THE DEPARTED,
t,! About ihree years since, while residing
s i in the village of N , I was first introf;
duced to Miss L. She was the orphan
. daughter of the late General L. (a distio^
guished officer in the U. S. Army,) and
the only child of her widowed mother.
When I first saw her clad in the
e weeds she wore for ber recently deceased
it father, I was particularly struck with her
I- personal loveliness and beauty. Tne charm
of "rosy cheek" and ruby lips were dis.
tinctly mnrked upon her lovely face?while
s ber full bright eye bespoke unusual iotoliL
I- genco of mind and omiableness of heart?
y and her dark hair, parted plainly upon her i
p beautful forehead, gave a soft finish to the
r striking contour of her features.
Mrs. L. and her daughter had come to
h make N their permanent wiiter
residence, and more mature acquaintance
1, discovered that Miss L. was not dependent
solely on her personal charms to recome
mend her admiration. She was indeed
t beautiful?but more than this, she possessed
e a highly gifted mind, which had been
it carefully cultivated. No pains nor expense
h had been spared in her education, and her
d attainments wero already quite superiori,
For though at this time but 18 yean of
d age, she was familiar with several an.
r guages, her reading was extensive, tnd
a she was skilled in many of the elegantace
complishmcnts. Indeed one needed bit a
s short acquaintance with her to be assired
it that for solidity of character, intelligence
;, of mind, and loveliness of temper, as well
- as elegance of manners, Miss L. was ies>f
lined to shine in every circlo which enjoyed
- her presence. It was not strange then that
r she was the pride of that widowed one, who
if i clung to her, as her earthly all. Cften
s j have I looked upon that mother
JI and daughter, so happy in their rrutual
i affections?the former so blessed in the
- child, who seemed to realize her .ondest
r expectations, and the daughter so ievoted
r so confiding; and have said to myself, sure- j
s ly there is domestic bliss, even for ths widow
J and the orphan !
Tujrt vonre nnccArl r\n 1.. WftS the
' more beloved as she was more known, but
^ best esteemed by those who knew her best.
* For while she mingled occasionally in the
8 social circles of N., and was universally
* admired and caressed, the greatest fart of
^ her time was devoted to the happiiess of
her mother, and to the continued in^rove^
men of her own mind. My distance from
J her was such, that 1 could not often s?e her;
* but I al ways met her on ' the sacred solemn
* day," in the sanctuary; and he* meek
? and solemn aspect, her fixed and careful
attention, to the instructions ofdiviie truth
* caused me to hope, that with all her jetlings
?; she was seeking that wisdom whiclicometh
' from above. The sequel of her history
'?| encourages the belief that I was nd mistaBI
taken. She was still sometimes seen in
" the "gny and festive hall," and those scenes
s of amusement to which her statior in life
andher early associates had led her,but now
there was on expression in her coun?
tenance, which said hef heart was noj
there.
About a year since, I met her it com.

j the home of a friend. She was not well.
I A cold had occasioned an unpleasant
? cough, which still affected her.* It was
t not however regarded as a serious indispo?
sition, and excited little apprehension, 6ave
. in an anxious mot er's heart. I saw her ;
| in the spring. She was better, but not well.
r The rose had faded upon her cheek, and '
l her face was thin and delicate. But it was j
believed by her friends that the warm
weather would restore her. The summer ,
was passed in travelling and visiting her (
friends, and in September she returned to i
N. I soon called to sec her. She was
I "better, much better, except that a little cold '
had renewed her cough." But she was
. now sadly changed. I noticed the anxious {
expression of h? r mothers face, as she look- (
; ed upon her lovely child { and as I heard ]
the gentle soothing words, "Mother, you
are too anxious for me, I am mucli better," {
my heart sunk within me with dread fore- '
bodings. ] feared that permanent disease
i had fasfrnnd iin??n hnr.
The New Year's day had come. It was I,
a day of gladsome joy?friends were greet- j i
ing friends?parents and children were j i
gathered round the fireside hearth to | j
mingle their congratulations?and the
# (
village of N. was rejoicing in the festivities t
of the season. But there was an upper .
chamber in that villigo, which presented a j
solemn scene. There was a lovely,
beautiful girl, whom scarcely twenty sum- r
mers had ripened into womanhood, who c
had grown up amid the facinatior.s of the ?
world, the object of admiration and love? *'
"the only child of her mother and she a
widow"-?Sho had now come up and laid t
her down upon the bed of death. There /
was the agonized, heart stricken parent, b
looking upon the wasting away of all she I
lo*vvl "pop. earth. TVre ware kind and - n
loving friends, and there was one to whom
this dear young girl had given her early j
love?to whom she was affianced ! Oh
how they all strive to keep strong her hold i
on life ! And there were Christian friends !
who "gathered round her bed, and bent J
their knees in fervent supplication to'ho ]
throne of mercy" that the dear loved one <
might live. But she for whom they wept ]
and prayed was calm?composed. She
did not long for life. Sue could leave the
mother whom she loved as her own soul?
him to whom her heart was ph'dgpd, and
all those doting friends. She looked on all
unmoved, and only desired of them, and
prayed that they might be reconciled to.
God's holy will.
A few more days, and the last morning
of her briefexistence dawned?(it was ihe
2lst insi). 44 My dear mo her," said she,
* rr* ..
altera season ot great sun ring," you musi
give me up, I cannot live. Do, d ar mother
give me up to God." The agonised
mother replied, 44 I do try, my dear, I will."
44 Oh, how happy slid she, ui now feel, for I
would rather depart and be with Cnrist?
I want to be with the Saeior."
The shadows of evening had scarce begun
to gather, when she said to a fri'-nd who
sit beside her," A cold wind blows over
me, and I feel strangely?the room is dark,
bring more light." A light was brought, *
and her friend observed (to her great sur?
prise, for it was not supposed that her end
was near) that tho seal of death was on lu*r!
She said,44 My dear A. I believe you are
dying, shall I call your mother ?" 44 -Yes," j
said, she, 44 and call A.?and call tbe children."
To her they came. She could not
speak, but kissed them all. Then placed
her attenuated arm around her mother's
neck?her hand iu his to whom it nud been
pledged.
The An el of tho Covenant,
Was come?and faithful to his promise stood,
Prepared to walk with her thro' death's dark valo.
And now her eyes grew bright, and brighter
still,
Then closod without a cloud,
They set, as sets the morning star?
That croes not down behind the darken'd west,
Nor hides obscured among the tempests of tho j
sky,
But melts away into the light of hoaven!
Dear youth,who may re td this sketch believe \
me it it is no picture of the fancy, no tale I
of the imagination. You have read highly
colored descriptions on the page of romance,
and your sensibilities have been was
ted in ideal sorrows. But here is a scene,
the realities of which have been recently
enacted?here are hearts now bleeding un.
der this bereavement, and the wounds thus
made, the consolations of the gospel are
alone adequate to heal. * And what, think
yon, can reconcile one to such a sceno
to such a death ? What is there that can
reconcile one in the spring time of life, surtounded
by the fascinations of the world, endowed
with every gift and grace to charm
and captivate?the onjectof admiration and
esteem?fnll of new-born hopes of life and
happiness with a chosen one,?what is there
to reconcile such a one to death ? How ]
could she leave such a home, such fronds,
such prospects, to go alone through the dark
valley to the eternal world ? It io the cross ;
?the cross, that giveth power. Oh how s
strong a proof is such a scene to the reality j
of tho Christian hope ! that can rejoice tho
heart in every final separation?enable it to
break every tie, and wings its way triumphantly
to the untried scenes of another world ! j
Reader,hast thou such a hope? youth, beauty,
talent, learning, the best of friends, the
fondest love, aro all vain to keep thee when
God calls. He may soon summon thee. If
not this month, perhaps the next--~-perhaps
before another year-?Whither then will
thy spirit fly ! M. S. S.

A curious little book lately published in Boston,
called "The History of tho Striped Pig."
gives the following humorous account of the !
effect w^ught upon a rum-selling professor, by
a dream of h.'s son.
"Good Brother M?, after a hard day's '

We remember the conversion of a pious
deacon of this spiritual description from his delusions.
It happened in this w se : ,
"Papa," said one of his boys to the deacon,
"I had a funny dream last night!" ,
" Well, Tommy, what was your funny j
dream?" I
"Why, I dreamed that the devil came into s
your store"?
"The devil!" 1
" Yes, pa, the devil, and that he found you |

James, who has fits, and who broke his little
baby's arm the other day, because she cried
when he came home drunk. And I thought
the devil came up to the counter, and laid the
end of his long tail down on a chair, and leaned
over towards the barrel of gin where you
were stooping to draw it out, and asked if you J
want a deacon. And I thought you didn't ,
look up, but said you was, and then he grinned,
and shook his tail like a cat that had a ,
mouse, and says he to me, "Thai ere's the dea- .
:on for me\" and laughing so loud that I put
my fingers m my ears and woke up "
This dream was more than the father could
stand; but it put an end to his delusion, and to
his trado in ardent spirits.
