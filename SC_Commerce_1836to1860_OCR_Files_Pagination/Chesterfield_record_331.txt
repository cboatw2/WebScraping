k dunce. It is precisely so with our crops,
k One wpli fcd acre u more profitable, dwn'
three poor fed ucrta, because it requires
but one-third of ttie labor, and will, oftentimts,
give an equal or greater product.?
Take Indian corn for example, the average
product of which 1 will assume to be thirty
bushels an acre. Now if we make an acre
of suitable soil rich with twenty.five loads
of unfermcnted dung, and tend- the crop
well, we may g .1 ninety I ushols of corn
from the aero?unJ tho amount has oftener
*becn swelled to one hundred and ono hundi
ed and tweiry. Mere, then, is a net gain
of sixty bushels by feeding an acre w< II,
oyer the Bet gain of an acre not fed at all
In regard to theeroslof tho manure, call it,
if you please, $25, J?nJ consider it capital
expended. If you deduct this from the
profits of the well fed acre, there would atill
remain a difference ia favor of the latter.
? r
according to the common scale oi prices, oi
$35. If you merely charge the interest on
tt?e outlay, this would be $1 50, and would,
. diminish tho p.(Terence between the good
and bad acre but this amount, or would
leave the crop on the rich acre Worth 859
more than that 3n the poor acre. Estimate
fanner's corn crop at ten acres, and
you will perceive that the cultivator of the
ten rich acres realizes a net $580 more than
the cal.ivator of the ten poor acres. Carry
out this comparison to the products of the
whole farm, and we shall at onco discover
why the good farmer finds a profit in an
outlay every four years of $20 an acre, in
enriching his lands. But if we suppose?
what is, in fact, the truth, that the lung manor.',
which causes this grea; increase in
the corn crop, is as good for the next crop
as i: would have been had rt been summer
yarded, us was once, and is now often the

nothing?the food of the corn crop is abso"km-iy

We further hear that Mr. Hunter will appo:nt

Under this flag, it is expected that Geor

and Mississippi will vote for the States

no election b? ing made by the people, the
throe candidates, Van Buren, Harrison and
Calhoun or Scott, will be carried into the
present House of Representatives for their
selection. Gen-"Harrison has no great
force in the South, and cannot take any ol
their votes ; Mr. Calhoun, however, will
defeat Mr. Van Btirefi there, and stand a
much better chance in the House, for th?*
satno reason that Hunter has done in regard
to Speaker, than either Harrison or Van
Bu en. In fact, it may be said that in 'he
present state of parti?s throughout tho Union,
John C. Calhoun and the State Rights
party hold the balance of power, and can
determine who sh >11 or who shall not be the

important development
-An editorial article in the New York
Courier Enquirer of tho 20.h ul>., in relation
to a charge against the house of Ba.
ring, Brothers & Co. of London, former
Agents of the Bank of the United
States deeply involving the honor of :li?t
house, has excited great sensation among
the monied and coinrnerci.nl classes of New
York. The substance of this charge is con,
tainnd in the following statement fiotn that
paper:
We charged that, on the 23d of August,
Baring, Brotherr& Co. after being ir.fo mi
ad by Mr. J iudon on the 20th ol August
. that he would require some half million sier,
ling on the 26tli, and being assured by them
I there would be no difficulty in raising it
I upon the Stntu,stocksf &c. offered as secu;
ritv,?addressed a li tter to their agent in
this country, divulging the fact that such
i applications had been made, declaring their
determination not to aid him and annnunc.
i ing that he must inevitably fail on the 28th.
> We now reiterate the charge ; and to
; exhibit the disgraceful conduct of this
house towards the B ink of the United
, Slates, we s*atp furiher that a merchant of
i this city shipped a valuable cargo to Sr.
I Petersburg. (Russia,) with orders ?o remit
i ilie proceeds without delay to Mr. Jaudon
in London, to me? t his engagements with
i the Bank of the United Slates or its agency
, in that city. The cargo arrived iir due
i time, and was disposed of agreeably to the
orders of the shipper ; but the agent or con.
sigee In St. Petersburgh has advised tho
house here that he has not remi led the
funds as directed, because letters have
been received in St. Petersburg from
the house of Barings B others 6c Co.
announcin ; the probable fa lure of Mr. Jaudon,
on the 26th August!! And he further
adv sen the shipper,?that in consequence of
such information, he had remitted the proreeds
of the cargo in question to the house
of Messrs. Burings, Brothers 6c Co., to be
by them passed over to Mr. Jaudon, in the
event of his note having been dishonored !!
Again : two merchants Philadelphia shipped
two d fie rent cargoes to Montevideo,
(South America.) with instructions to the.\r
consignees to remit the proceeds without
delay to Mr. Jaudon in London to meet
their engagements with the Bank of the
Udited Slates which had furnished in part
the funds for purchasing the enrgoes. Their
" Agent or Consignee, replies, thai letters had
been received in that city, from the house
of B;?rngs, Brodiers 6c Co., announcing the
probable failure of VIr. Jaudon on the 26th
a Mirnct #nH tftai he therefore retains their
VI it ia*fM ? ?
funds tn Montevideo until further instructions
! * The consequence is that one of
the houses alluded to hud its bills dishonored
in London !! !
A villain named Jan.es K r patrick, rep.
resenting himself to be a widower, having a
plantation in Missouii, and assuming extreme
piety, gained the affections of a widow
in Alton III., who had a handsome
property, and though aged 65, was m>irri?'d
to her.?He soon prevailed on her to nell
her propery, giving him possession of the
proceeds, with which he sturted off, with a
horse and wagon, bought with his wife's
money, to sell " Gun's Domestic Medicine,"
and some other books, and has not since
been heard of, leaving (he deceived widow
sick and destitute. Is was soon ascertained,
that he had absconded from Missouri, leav.
?ng a wife to^hom he hud been 43 years
married, in a destitute condition, ho owning
no property thers of any k'nd.

ADVERTISEMENTS IN NEWSPAPERS.
We find in an exchange, a paragraph
upon this subject, which we think contains
a good deal of wholesome truth and sound
advice. 14 If a dealer has any articles of
which he wishes to make a quick turn, and
| consequen'ly is willing to sell at a small
profit, he is sure to advertise h ; but if he
means to make a large profit out of his customers,
ho is generally rather sly about ? .
Men and women who have their eye-teeth
cut, never trade at a store where they do
not advertise."
Small Pox at Boston.?The whole num.
b^r of cases, up to December 9, as reported
by a committee of physicians, is 248. The
committee subjoin the following remarks,
as illustration of the protective power ofvaccination,
as now generally practised in
this city. The whole number of slight cases
reported is 145 ; severe do. 51; fatal
21.?Making the slight cases to the rest as
about two to one. The persons reported as
immediately exposed to the disease, are
1592?of whom 64 only are known to have
jjtty
taken the disease, or about one in 23. Of o
the 22 cases which proved fa'al, IB were (
in persons never vaccinated, nor protected
bjr previous small pox, being nearly six out
ot seven. Of the remaining four, two hoJ 1
been vncinnateJ, and two had hud the small S
pox,one by inoculation, and the oher in <1
the natural way. Assuming the population r
of the city at 80,000, and the number of
cases at 300, the proportion of inhabitants, e
who have taken the disc ise is 1 to 2S6 ?i
The number of deaths which have occurred I
is 22, which being averaged on the forego ^
ing population, is one in 3636, and of those
vaccinated only one in 4l),000. The fore-1 r
going results, added to the fact that it is now (
nearly half a century since small pox has r
spread in this cry to any alarming degree, 1
will enable the Association and the public
to form some estimate of the value of the

FRIDAY EVENING, JANUARY 10, 1839
The coiuuunication relating to the K v.
Mr. Pierpont we are obliged to po tpone till
next week, for reasons which we will explain
to the writer.
We are indebted to ;he Hon John Camp*
bell, and the Hon. Thomas P. Sumter for
sundry valuable documents; and we art
indebted to som" Post Muster* for hastening
the speed of sunt documents, (as well as
all papers, directed io ijs from Washington
to Petersburg inclusive) b> giving them a
rid'* on the Wilmington and Hamburg rail
roads.
Persons wishing to give directions in regard
to advertisements or their papers, will please
send them in writing to tho office. Verbal
messages are sometimes sent by the apprentices,
which are liable to be either forgotten
or misunderstood.
Raleigh Reoister.?This highly respectab
e paper has just entered upon its 41st year
and made its appearance in an entirely new
and elegant dress. It :s beautifully printed
on excellent paper, and is to be issued henceforth
twice a week.
It is announced on the cover of tho Decembor
number of the Southern Agriculturist,
that the work is henceforth to be
discontinued. The cause doubtless is want
of patronage. Southern Planters must
understand better than they now do, how
much they need improvement in the science
and aft of Agriculture, before they will give.
I competent support to a work that costs thein
any more that what is next to nothing. In
place of the Southern Agriculturist will be
published the "Southern Compendium of Agriculture,
Horticulture, Domestic and Rural
Gconomy, Literature, the Arts and Sciences,
Sporting Intelligence &c." to be conducted
t>y John D. Legare, the former Editor of the
S. Agriculturist. We shall insert the Prospectus
of the new periodical next week.
A fire lately occurred in Charleston
which destroyed the Office of the Charles,
on Observer, wi.h the mail book and most
)f the publishing materials. The paper is
iusp^nded for about three weeks till new
materials for printing it shall be received

j The average proceeds per acre, at present

od to. Some of the estimates, however, arc too
high, whilst others aro too !;w, This Mr. Rob. (
orts knew, but ho took such estimates, supported ^
by respectable authori'y, as he found. He sus* ^
poets that in tho work from which No. 12 is ,
taken?a translation from tho French?the j
translator may have mistaken, the weight of |
cocoons for that of reeled silk. No. 13 is by a ^
Frenchman famous as French Minister at j
Washington during part of tho French Rcvolu. j.
tion, and af erwards settled in tho United States, r
Bci g of ardont temperament, and anxious, c
faom a conviction of the great profit to boderi*
ved from silk culture, to introduce it into h s
G
adopted country, he doubtless, in tho ardor of hit Q
zeal, took the highest estimates he could find, ^
supported by respectable authori'y.
? "* . - t lft!_ 1 _ 1 _ F
uount Dinaoio, irom wnom no. iuis ia*cn. is ^
considered, on all hands, the very highest author*
ity on all su jccts connected with the silk cul- j
tare in France. He makes tho average product f
per acre to be 198 lb. which at $6 would bring ^
$1188. This, then, may be taken as the average
product from standard white mulbery trees in c
France; for this was the kind of trees commonly
used in that country when Dandolo wrote,
and as the Carolinas are known to be not less t
favorable to the growth of the mulberry than r
France an equal quantity might be expected j
hero, from old standard trees. But cvon j,
the multicaulis, which is so much more pro. t|
duclive of leaves in proportion to the wood Q
than the white mulberry, cannot when kept cut ^
down to the hedge form,?as is the universal practice
in this country?be made to yield so j
great a quantity of leaves to the acre as n
standard trees, because the whole mass of (|
growing foliage wants so much of being as deep R
or high, though it may possibly be somewhat ^
more dense. It is to be borne in mind, however, ^
that although the gross product per acre is not 60
great from hedge as from standard troes, yi't c
the product in proportion to tire expense of money ^
and labor is greater. ' j
Mr. Roberts enters into a calculation) pp. 34,
35 to shew that an acre of multicaulis, at four
years old, will feed a million of worms, which
would produce 333} lb. of reeled silk; much more ?
than Dandolo's statement of the product from
Btandard while mulberries. But if the land is ^
made rich enough for this, which might perhaps
be done, the leaves would in that eaee ho too r
succulent to support the worm in full health, or ^
produco fino silk. In the ^arqjfeas, however
he important question is, How much can bo mad? fi
the hand,4toa not iiow much to tbe acre*
ring tliat hands cost so much, and acres so
tie; and seeing also that silk culture certainly
juires less land to either the hand or tlie profits
am any other agricultural occupation.
ACTUAL RESULTS.
But so many in this country have now made
beginning in the silk culture that we are not
pendent upon foreign authorities and mere
timatee to guide is in tin inquiry whether or
>t it may be made a profitable busiiiess~
umerous ezperiinen|e have boon made and
iblishcd in detail. To the actual results of
few of these we invite attention, presenting
en in a condensed form, to save rcom,
1. Mr. Aaron Clapp, of Hartford, Conn, xn a
imrnunication published in one of the November
Jmbers of Morris's iSilk Farmer, States that in
ie second week of May last, he planted an aero
id a quarter of Multicaulis in furrows thrco
et apart, laying down the routs and trees,
ithoul cutting, and thewtovering them up, On
ie first, second and third weeks in June, tho
'orms fed from these trees were hatched, and
lade 50 bushels of excellent cocoons: What
3 reeled produced one pound ?*f silk to. tho
ishel, which ho siys "is pronounced by good
idgcs to be beltof than the imported." Morn
laves, \to says, were 'eft on the trees than wero
alhored; shewing that he might have made at
iast 100 lb, of reeled silk, from his acru and a
uarter, with only a lew weeks labor of a fow
and*; that too, the season the trees were
(anted* and in the climate of New England
'here the growth of foliage is less than half
'hat it is in the southern states, He could
iavc sold 100 lb. of silk for $600. His worms
eqnircd attention for seven weeks. Abundaet
xpericnco proves that in this climate worms need
ttcntion not more than from three to five weokn.
Ar Clapp the first threa weeks employed two
icrBons, one to gather the leaves, the other to
aoA !\nil ntfrtnit to ?Hn ffArmn tha fourth and
[fth weeks, four person* , tho sixth week, two
icrsons, and the seventh, one. He weighed his
eaves and found that 80 lb. of leaves mode 2 lb,
>f silk.
His cocooners and fixtures were very inconvoliont,
and he had the leaves gathered one by
>ne to avoid injuring the buds. He thinks
hat with a convenient cocoonery, and thu labor
>f two moio handj for two weeks, ho could atend
to a million of worms; and a million of
vorms are allowed to produce 333| lb. of silk ;
vhich at $6 would be $2,000. The labor of
ccling would be necessary in addition to that of
ittending to the worms, ftut good cocoons*
in reeled, sell at $5 pt r bushel, at which price the
1331 bushels would bring $1666.
Mr. Clapp, in the s&mo publication states tho
'oliowing facts.
The following will fully prove that (he
statement which i have given is not extravigunt.
Cupt. James Marsh, of Hartford, raised
his s-ason one and a half bushel of cocoons
Yom two square rods of ground, equal to
107} bushels to the acre, and at $5 the
jushei would amount to $537 50. ? _
S. B. Goodwin, of YVethcrsfield, gathered
this 8'-ason 3575 pounds of muhicaulia
leaves from one.fourth of an acre of ground,
equal to 14,300 pounds of leaves to un acre;
iti>d allowing that eighty pounds of leaves
will make one pound of silk,it would practice
178 pounds and 12 ounces, and at $6
u pound would amount to $1068.
Dr. Holt, of Glastenbury, obtained 70
pounds of multicnulis leaves at one time
picking from the rod of ground, equal to 11,2U0
pounds to the acre,
Mr. Churth of Be;lilcm? from five years'
mniinit cilk fmm different
~Apc~l IflllW ??' ?
Kperics of mulberry, is fully saiisfied that
the mulucuul s will make equally os pood, 9
if nut superior, to any other kind. Mr.
C. further states he has repeotedly obtained
one pound of reeled silk from lbs. of
cocoons, although it cannot generally be
axpec'ud,
2. Mr. J. Dan forth of Hartford, in a comrouni.
sation dated Sept. 19th, 1838 and addressed to
be Coramittce|nn Silk ofthe American Institute,
vhich was published in tho Journal ot that
Association, states that about the middle of May,
I w38, he measured off the eighth of an acre of
ight sandy land, considered good corn land, and
dantf d in H 780 Morus M.dticaulis troes, huvng
had their tops partially or wholly killed
iy the severe froit of tho preceding winter.?
The worms fed on these trees made 9 bushels of
tocoons, which, as far as reeled, yielded one
tound of silk to the bushel. This is at the rate
if 72 lb. of silk to tho acre. The whole weight
if leaves gathered was 1164 lb. which divided
?y 9 gives 129J as the weight of leaves to the
lound of silk. The most of the worms were of
he small two crop kind, which made cocoons
equiring 4.000 to yield a pound of silk. Tho
eaves having been weiglied at gathered, it was
bund that these 4,000 worms consumed 144 lb.
)f the large worms, called at the north, six
reeks worms, thero were 5,000; 2500 of the
. - .i -1 j- j j _im.
ocoona maae oy mese yieiucu u puunu m hik
nd this number consumed 90 lb. of leaves. It
i evident, then, that it is moro profitable to fcdd
be large worm than tho small one, in the inverse
alio of 90 to 144. It is also evident ^hat if the
1641b. ofleavoshad been fed entirely to the irge
worm, the quantity of silk would have been +
be quotient of 1164 divided by 90, that is, a little
ver 12 9.10 lb. from the eighth of an acre ; or
he rate of more than 113 lb. to the acre, and
his in Connecticut, the first year. In the intro.
uction to Mr. Danforlh's statement he says .*
I would first premiso that in making a trial of
le silk culture, it was my deaire to adopt a
lode which coald be followed hy our agricultu.
ists at large, rather than to the greatest <
ossible quantity of silk that cotfWbe produced
ora a given portion of land." Towards the
lose of bis statement, he aJds; "Every one
rho takes op the culture of silk is surprised at

nd of tbui experiment it may bo observed that
one of the persons who took eve of tie trees,
athered the leaves, or fed the worms, had ever
sen a tree or silk worm before.**
It is to this silk made by Mr. Danforth that

blowing passages.
