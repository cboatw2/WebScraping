CIRCULAR.?When the managers laid before
the public the Scheme for Class E, of the
Alexandria Lottery, (which is how withdrawn and
the the accompanying Scheme substituted in its
place) the country was in a: state .of great prosperity;
aud they felt warranted in risking the result
of so heavy a Scheme, however limited in amount
the sale might be?the suspension of specie payments
by the Banks, and the general derangement
of tho internal exchanges throughout the
Union, that subsequently took place, induced the
managers to postgone the day of drawing to the
23d of Tepteinber next, before which lime, it wan
hoped, a more favorable state of things would be
brought about But as the internal exchanges
have been getting worse instead of better, andas
no reasonable hope can be now,/indulged of an
immediate amendment, the managers are compelled
to announce the withdrawal of the Scheme
heretofore published for Class E of the Alexandria
Lottery, Capital Prize 75,000 dollars. .The
postponement of this Scheme, having met with
approbation at the time, the managers truRt that
the withdrawal of it now will only be considered
an act of prudence demanded by the state of the
times. j *
The public aro aware that the only drawback in
favor of the managers ie the 15 per cent.bn prizes
which is to provide for the payment of the lottery
contracts, all commissions, expenses, and the risks
and hazards to be run. Until the state of the
. country is such, that the transmission of funds
from one point to another can be done at reason,
able rates, and thus enable the managers to concentrate
funds for the prompt payment of heavy
prizes, tney do not feel justified in running .unwarrantable
risks by the drawing of extraordinary
^Schemes* The reasons arc so many and obvious,
that they are persnaded the propriety of this course
will he readily admitted. It is the intention however
of tho managers so soon as internal exchanges
are re-est&Dlished, to re-issue the Scheme
now withdrawn, or others equally as brilliant.

SUPPLEMENT TO THE GLOBE.
PROSPECTUS
FOR THE
CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE AND APPENDIX.
Sensible of the dt?ep interest which must he felt
throughout the Union in the peooeedings of a new
Congress, convoked by the new administration, to
meet the extraordinary emergencies which have
arisen since the close of General Jackson's term of
service, the undersigned have already made prepationa
to furnish their annual report in the form of
a Congressional Globe. As these succe.-sive publications
comprise a full and faithful r<cord<6f all
.that is done in Congress?sketches of the attendant
discussions, with an Appendix containing the
finished speeches prepared by the members themselves?.tney^,
a re suited not only to gratify the
curiosity oi the hour, to inform the distant c tnstitue.ncy.
of the part "performed by their immediate
representatives, and of the result of the labors ol
I all; butr we donbt not, they will be found pcrma:
nently useful as the most authentic,complete, and
convenient parliamentary-, record _of our times.
This undertaking h ving, with these views, been
liberally patronized by the public, it is our purpose
to justify this early and continued favor by.increasing
the strength of our corps of Reporters at
the next fall and winter Sessions.. The Fall Session
will be looked to by the country to settle all
that has been unsettled by. the overthrow of the
system of Deposites as established by Congress?
the overthrow of the currency as established by
the Constitution?and the overthrow of the system
of revenue, both .:<s a means of adequate supply
for present demands, the..maintainance of manufactures,
and the regulation of commerce. Every
thing of pecuniary interest to the Government
and ihe nation will be involved in the discussions
of the next Congress; and.it was because the President
would not have those all important subjects
left to Executive discretion a moment beyond the
time/when a full Congress could be summoned,
that the September session was convoked . The
machinery of government, even when thrown out
bf gecr, must continue to work >. but when so disordered,
its movement may be. driven in a wrong
direction. ? 'I'he Representatives of the people are
alone competent to set all to rights. No Demo- .
cratic Chief Magistrate would continue, in the
condition of things at present existing, to substitute
Executive expedients for clearly defined law
springing front the public will.

THE SATURDAY PREACHER.
. A SERMON ON TALEBEARING.
'He that repeatetk a matter eepcrateth very friends."
There is a class of people every where
to be found, who under pretence of doing
you a friendly act, make mischief between
you and your friends. They do it
i>y repeating any little remarks which
liappen to be unfavorable to the absent
[>arty, and which, but for being told him
ly the officious friend, would never have
tone him any Harm, or created any coldless
between him and their author.
, In speaking of friends seperated from
his cause, I would net be understood to
nean friends in the strictest sense of the
erm?such as Cicero describes them in
lis treatise on frindship?but merely such ,
is are called, and miiy be considered, very ,
jood friends, as the world goes; which
neans little else than not being enemies \
?and is. if I mav art ationlr miliar a do. I
.. _ ?-? ?, ? - "v" i
native than a positive friendship.. But j
my friendship, which is sincere as far (
is it goes, is better than enmity: and |
lence tney do a very serious injury, who ,
>y ltheir ofBciousness or false pretences, ,
:ausc disaffection between you and your ,
riends, or neighbors?which last, now I
hink of it, is the more proper word.
These talebearers possibly may someimes
be actuated by a frindly motive; but
f so, their zeal sadly outruns their discreion,
and by a 'wo ful lack of prudence,
md judicious silence which would cost |
he'm nothing, they .in a moment create '
mmity between fellow creatures; which |
jftentimes a whole life cannot repair. !
I have a most, sovereign contempt, not
o say abhorrence, of this species of go- j
jetween. /riends. My charity, which
>pens the door of kindness to all classes 1
)f people, well nigh refused to be at hoihe '
o this; and I would much sooner forgive J
,he person, who says an unjust thing of J
ne, than the ofljeious wretch who reports
t to my earsv. There is in his conduct 1
something like malace prepeose; because
le knows, before repeating them, that the
iffensive remarks will be likely to make '
Tuschief; and yet with this knowledge
>efore him, he does not restrain his vile
losirc of blabbing. Such a person, who- !
her he act from sheer thoughtlessness,
rom an odious fondness for mischief, is
aot of a nature to be trusted. He i? below
the confidence of friendship; is a
dangerous and troublesome neighbor;
and is by all means to be avoided.
How .many trifling things arc every
day said, which would nol be complimentary
even to the best of persons; but!
could . do them no harm, if not conveyed
to their hearing. And then the injury is
owing'splefy to this officious conveyance.
U causes an irretation to tho feelings,
which is detrimental to one's happiness
at the prcsetit time, and may continue to
rankle long afterwards. . , * . .
From my very childhood I never could
endure talebearers. They made mischief
between me and my playmates. I abhorred
them then; I contemn them now. I
never did, and never will, encourage a
talebearer.
Persons of this officious class are often
to be met with. They will come to you
with their tongues itching to repeat something
to your disadvantage. They will
ingeniously play about the subject in order
to excite your curiosity, and draw
from you a request to hear the story. As
thus: ''
'It is very strange how people will talk
about their neighbors!'
'Umph!'
'Even the best of us can't escape the
tongue of slander.'
Umph!*
.,, 'I had my feelings very much hurt last
evening at some remarks, which as a friend
to you?'
?Umph!-?Tol lol lol!?fiddlededee!'
'They were very injurious, I do assure
you.* ,
'.Well, sir, and what if they were?' .
!,J 'Why, I thought you might like to hear
them.*
? 'What! like to hear bad accounts of
myself!'
'Why, yes; I had my feelings amazingly
hurt on your account, and I thought I
might as well?'
'Hurl my feelings too? You're amazingly
kind, upon my word!'
'Why, yes, I thought it would be no
more than a neighborly act to?'
'Such neighborly arts 1 detest;, and let
me tell you, sir, if you have no better
business than setting frifends by the ears
in this manner, you are indeed a poor
contemptible creature.* , ? ?
Oh, sir, if you take my neighborly of?
/voa o/t tiiiLirwili" I liflC?#* nAt hi nrr rvineo

say?the secret shall die with mo, and?'
Then there will be two troublesome
things d^ad. , ..Leave me!* ..
He will depart, crest-fallen and ashamed
Another will come, not doubting but his
ill news will be acceptable. He is ready
to communicate it? and only asks that he
shall not be named as the officious person
who reported the matter.
Now don*l tell any body that I told
you; because If you should, you'd bring
me into difficulty you knoVv.'
* You'll get into difficulty at all events,
unless
a
i n
[ 'Promiso now, upon your Mered honor
[not to tell who told you, so (hot I needn't
be brought into mischief, and?'
Doubtless you'll make mischief between
me and niy friends!!
Why, reaally. I profess % friendship
for you myself, and thought it a thousand
pities you should be slandered without
knowing it.' ?
Give yourself no trouble, Mr. Limbertongue.
If I should never hear of the
slander, it will do me no harm.*
Mercy on me! do you want to be slandered
without knowing it?' Certainly,
if I am slandered at all.?
There's the door, Mr. Limbertonguc.'
This is the only way. Give no encouragement
to talebearers, and they will
ceace to trouble you. If you can con- <
Bcienliouslj entertain a good opinion of i
yourself, you will in general have little .<
cause to trouble yourself about the idle <
remarks ot individuals, ??r the world.? i
But, at all events, if you would pass qui- i
etly though tho short space of life allot- *
ted you* never lend a listening ear to t
those mischievous pretenders to friend- s
ship, whose chief business it is to repeat
a matter, and seperate very friends.' t

Away to the Dismal Swamp hespet.Js, .
Through tangled juniper, bedB of reeds, '
Through many a fen where the serpent feeds. 8
We copy the subjoined interesting ac- r.
count of a visit to the Lake in the Dismal J
Swamp, from the Portsmouth Times,
whose editor ought to take a jaunt some- ^
where at least one day in each "week, if
he will only write as agreeable an ac- 1
count of it when he returns to his post, as 1
lie has done of his visit to Lake Orpin- ?
mond, or as he did of the Inauguration 1
?ccne at Washington in March last. A ]
trip up our Canal, as far as it is finished, j
would affortl him a subject rich in natural
beauties, and also in the. wonders of art, *
as displayed in the stricture of the Canal. !
We should like very much, however, to j
visit the scene of the following description-^?a
scene which we have had ill our 1
mind's eye ever since, thirty years ago,
we read Moore's ballad, from which the '
above stanzas are extracted :
[From the Portsmouth (Va.) Times.]
Saturday was -a blue day hereabouts, *
but its troubles were not for us. With a l
party ot light-hearted souls we had reached
the beautiful canal that traverses the
great Dismal; and the sun, that looked
out near mid-day from the clouds upon
hundreds and thousands of anxious faces,
witnessed in our little .assemblage a score
of as happy exceptions, as could that day
be found in our wide-spread country.?
Not that, kind reader, we would have you
ior a iiiomem 10 unuersianu mat we were
bound on a pilgrimage to that matrimonial
Mecca, from whose bourne no pretty
Miss returns; for although there were in
our little vessel temptations sufficiently,
powerful "to make one willing to fly to the
uttermost parts of the earth for their sake,
we were intent on no such errand. No,
affairs had come to a crisis with none of.
us. . .We were J^it upon anothcr pilgrim
age, ahd resol^P to test for ourselves the
claims of that far-famed lake, whose wild
and lonely beauties awoke the Irish muse
to strains captivating as' those chaunted
over the most charming Parisian recess.An
early and an excellent brakefast,
prepared by Cait. Baugh, the proprietor
of the hotel at Deep Creek ; a good boat
with comfortable accommodations amf^ttentive
bands, furnished by the same gentleman
; a fine day, exceeding our expectations,
prepared us in the best possible
manner for the spectacle which was in
store for us. A romance reader, or some.
sweet girl, whose mind is attuned to other
harmonies than those of knives and forks,,
may pronounce all . this vastly unintellec-. ,
tual. We beg leave to disagree with her (
or him, and we dare say, Tom Moore (
himself would hear its out in the assertion,
that without such preliminaries, no
one could relish as they deserve the beau- ,
ties of Lake Drummond, or any other ,
lake upon earth equally difficult to ac- ;
cess. .. v . . ? . .. . The
passage through the canal, however,
forbidden it might appear to those
who have not tried it, was certainly delightful.
There was nothing, it is true,
but a stream of water, smooth as a mirror,
stretching far aivay into the distance, and
parting the blue woods that scarcely were
perceptible above the horizon ; banks rivalling
in their beautiful level the engi
ncer s most pcricct work ; forests., whose
luxuriant, verdure and tangled recesses
were such as creation's dawn beheld them,
with here and there a house at wide intervals,
built for the wry-farer's comfort,
yet adding if possible to the sense of solitude
; or a lonely bark propelled by her
crew, who stalked laboriously along the
bank, gliding with set sails before the
wind, and breaking the surface of the
waters in golden tipples. But these were
enough to fill the mind of every one with
pleasing contemplations. Here nature
and art were exhibited on a scale equally
great. The seemingly impenetrable masses
of reed, vine, and forest, guarded as
they were by miro and waters, which
overspread the face of the region, had
yielded to the arm of human industry, amh
here was the monument of its triumph.
About noon we reached ihc small canal*
called the feeder, which connects the main
channel with the lake. A little below this
the horse which drew our boat was trans*
ported on a float bridge across the canal.
The bank on this side presented no such
road as that we had left. A narrow path,
worn in the moss apd grass by the feet of
the hardy boatmen and raft crews, alone
was left for the faithful animal. When we
entered the feeder this became yet more
contracted. > The luxuriant soil shot up ?
growth which could not be repressed by
the steps of the workmen. Here nature
appeared in her original grandeur. The
Arcs which had elsewhere desolated the
noble forest, presented her none of their
effects. The vast trees on either hand
towered high over our heads, mantled to
the topmost boughs with their vernal
Iress, and almost to their summits folded
n the embrace of the flowering jessamine
md other vines. A strong current oppoing
our progress, we hod ample time to
M'come imbued with the spirit of the
cene The ladies appeared thoughtful,
ind suspended a tvlule the sweet tones
hat hitherto had won, perhaps too much,
>tir thoughts from the spectacle before us.
However, ere wo became too much im>rcssed
with the solemnity of the spot,
i distant opening in the woods was revealid,
and a glimpse was caught of the obect
of our visit. < A few minutes more
bund us at the lock, within three hundred
ranis of the lake. . Another brief internal,
and we were upon its bosom. A de'cription
of this beautiful body of water
s what we have neither lite lime nor tho
ibility to attempt. Alone, and lovely in
is loneliness, girt with the ancient trees,
whose shadews were cast a thousand years
>g<> silent on all its shores, with not a
"louse in their extensive circuit, nor a boat
save our own; resting upon its waters, it
surpassed our utmost anticipations, and
mprcssed each one that then beheld it
for the first time, with the most pleasihg
amotions. ...... ?~
Hut it is not a second nor a third visit
which can render the lake an unattractive
lbjcct.- Hour* or days might he spent in
ho neighborhood, and the scene would be
eplete with pleasurable associations.?
Fhore were those in our party who had
beheld it attain and again; others who had
traveled far and dwelt with delight upon
the beautiful lakes of our continent; yet
its attractions were still fresh to the former,
while the latter declared it a rival of
the fairest they had witnessed. ..
Heretofore the lake has not enjoyed
the celebrity to which its merits fairly entitle
it- This may,in a great measure, be
attributed to the difficulty in procuring
the means of access. Strange as it may
seem, there is no boat kept regularly; and
built for the purpose. Boats may indeed
be obtained by making application some
days beforehand/but there is frequent disappointment.
. They, are kept, foe other
niirnrtsoc onil 01*0 Al'lon

Wp would recommend to the worthy proprietor
of the hotel, the keeping of a neat
light boat adapted to the purpose. It
would certuinly richly compensate him for
the trouble, while he would have a further
recompense in the consciousness that his
efforts Were instrumental in diffusing the
fame of one of the finest and most picturesque.
bodies of water on the continent.
How was this lake, twelve or fifteen
mdes in circuit, and at the summit level
of the swamp, formed, was a query which
each was unable to answer. Some attributed
it to the agency of 6re, to which
surmise the charred fragments at the bottom
gave color. H,.-. ... .... >--.
After resting more.than an hour in the
shade of. an ancient cypress, beneath
whose branches our boat was fastened*
find theic partakinc with keen annetitee
of a store of viands provided for the occasion,
we again sought the feeder, and
turned homeward. The sun went down
long, before we reached the Creek, out
the moonlight made ample amends for his
absence, while the firefly lit up his tiny
lamp to swell the agreeable association
of the scene.
Cut and comf. again.?On the 18th
inst. a female convict named Julia Ann
Hall, 29 years of age, made her escape
from the State Prison at Weathersfield,
Conn.,, She was employed in the yard,
and escaped by moving two stones from
underneath the wall. She had been sen*
tenced to prison seven years for setting
fire to the Hartford Jail. She took with
her a pair of brown pantaloons and A
short Jacket, with which ahc accourtred
herself and travelled 40 milts day and .
night,.when she was overtaken by an officer.
She attempted to laugh him out of
the idea that she was any thing but a man
but it was of no use; she was hcl| cd- to a
seat in a wagon and soon returned to her
proper place of abode.
Salaries to Governors.?From a ta?
ble in the Toronto Constitution, it appears
that the four Governors of Upper and
Lower Canada, New Brunswick and Nova
Scotia, receive annual salaries amounting
to $72,000, while the Governors of
twenty-four States in the Union receive
by $54,782.
