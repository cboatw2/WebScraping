Uno >f these will l>e conducted, us to form arid

r the long established Quarterly Reviews of Great
Britain and tho United States, and. of course,
will consist exclusively of original articles. Th
a" other department will be of miscellaneous nnd
various eontonis. select d as well as original, and
>*' designed in part for the purpose of mere amuse.
-- incut, us well as for information and instruction.
ip I ? n g ird to suhj cts, and to the opinions to
)- ho cxpr s ed upon them, wide scope is cl limod
? for the conduetois, a d will he allowed to the
d other contributors to the tvork. A portion of the
more prominent articles will relate to ]>oliLical ecoiiomy
and to general politics, (that is, to the
' uobie science of government, and not in the
r least to the despicable contest-. of parties for pow.
[ or or palt*?, and the application ol sound gener il
' _ principles on these subjects to the government
x nid oplicy of this country. Well written com
v muuications on such subjects arc especially do.
sired, an:l, if not opposcu in in principle to the
iC design of this publication, will be admitted to its
s pages, whether the writers may, 01 in nor points,

or,o i tlie contrary, such as may be deemed lielig
erodox, or the least sustained by tho approbation
and support of cither p<?pu'ar or official pow r.

ancu of ail subjects relating to gv.Mier.il policy and
government, which p irty spirit and craft may 1
:h have se.ged upon, as favor.ble positions or
to means fi-r party warfare. On the contrary,
m though avoiding to touch the various subjects oi
r. dispute between the existing parties, fas such;
jj, ni y frequently occur, ai d the o currence wil
jy ever be avoided or feared, that th?- maintenance

' the falsehood of some favorite doctrine, or the

for power.
:>r The po!ilic.il object and t ndency of the o j

But these and other grave subject*, important
