ble'the monstrous delusion can any longer go
down with the intelligeut people of this country.
These pills, mild and agreeable in their nature, '
should be kept in every family in cases of sudden '
illness, for by their prompt administration, chole
ra, cramps, spasms, fevers, and other alarming
complaints, which too often prove fatal, may be
speedily cured or prevented. In fact, all those

Messrs. Sandford Ar Gricne. i have seen ycuv
i Cotton "Gin in operation, arid Isavc examined tKo
1 cotton ginned by it, and pronounce it better cleansed,
arid the staple less injured, than any cetten
i that ever came under my observation. It is coni[
pletely ready for the breaker without the aid of tiio

in manufacturing the article. 1 consider collrn

to two cents on the pound more than the average
crops brought into the Manchester maijket, end
elennaed by common Gins. Ycurs, very rrrp'ly.

The Gins ordered will be delivered to the agents',
of planters in any of the sea port towns of the cotton
planting Slates, at the above prices, the agents
paying the freight on the same from Nrw v w
and becoming responsible for !he amount of the Gin.
It is desirable, when planters give orders for Gins,
they should accompany them with their views in
regard to the arrangement of saws, breasts, brush*
es, &c. ll is found they differ in opinion. Some
desire saws of larger diameter than others. The
most common size is 9 or 10 inches; but some wish
them 12 inches. Some wish 5 or 6 rows of brushes
on an axle, while others do not want more than 4
at most. Some wish saws with 8 or 9^teeth to the
Inch, while othere want 10 or 11. ^ ith so much
discrepancy, we prefer they should, at the time ol
giving orders, turnish a statement of their \vishcs,
and tnc manufacturerers can fulfil them in every
particular. Where it is lelt to our discretion, we
shiiU make them on the most modern and approved
Clan. An order can be executed, from the time it *
i received, in the space of eight or nine weeks
and the Gin tn that time placed in the hands of tho
factor To be in time for the next crop, all orders
ought to be in the hands of tho manufacturers by
- the first or middle of May ; except for plantations
where they are late in commencing to nick or ein
r cotton. . b
