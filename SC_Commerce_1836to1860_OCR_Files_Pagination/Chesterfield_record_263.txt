a third good one, appears piobable to evcy j
capacity, from a consideration of very com- j
mon principles, no withstanding admitted j
exceptions to general rules. But to sup. j
pose that an independent sexual abilty ex- j
ists in either male or female, appears culcu- '
lated to unsettle the doctnues of skilful men, j
and to lead to the adoption, in their stead, of j
opinions unsupported by a reference to any !
known principles, of leaving very important1
interests to the dangerous conduct of a blind i
guide. j
If it could be proved that stock are more ?
susceptible of improvement from the male
pdr?nt, the question then would be, how is (
a male, possessing the requisites, to be obtained
? Surely i: wi'i not be replied, that .
his being begotten by such male would
alone be sufficient, without the possession of
excellence on the dam's side. It is possiw
bio that a good male may beget a son
equally good as himself in externals, from
in hr..fk bad female, tut it is certain that 1
an uiwwi
such son iviil impiove comparatively an inferior
stock-getter, it being an established
fact that animals breed buck n point of re.
semblance; and it is therefore considered
necessary, for the object of improveme.it, j
or to retain excellence, to have a pedigree j
as little dubious as possible, for several |
generations. $j important, indeed, is this j
fact of correct descent, that many breeders, 1
who have from causes which i: is dillitul j
to ascertain, a well-bred animal of defective J
form, venture to use him, relying 0:1 his j
biood, and experience no reason for regre
that they have done so- But what, in such
circumstances is the mode of proceeding ?
is such m ile us"d indiscriminately to all the
females, or is it consid red necessary to
check his tendency towards defective form j
rr^rl nr?>nt< counteracting in the le.- }
WJ r w
males ? Undoubtedly such care is taken, !
and thus the system of judiciously counteracting
defects on either side, whether male
or female, is successfully practised, in pre.
ference to one adopted on the belief o! the
existence of an independent sexual capa?
bily.
It has been already remarked, that the
great improvement made during 1 ate years
in our breeds of stocks, has tended gr atly
to promote the agitation of ihe question at
issue. This is easily accounted lor. Va.
rious circumstances have combined to rouse
the attention of farmers to the unprofitable
state of their stocks. The consequence has
been, that well-bred mares have been re.
sorted to, and the produce of the first cross
has so far exceeded the most sanguine
hopes, taking its character in externals, as
well us in positive utility, in a great measure
from the well-bred male, that n av advocates
for the opinion in his favor have thus b?*en
added to the number which previously existed.

In the year ISU?, too Bntisn army la a i
siege to the city of B rutpore, in the East ;
Indies. The si''ge was a long one, the I
army large, and attended by thousands of
cattle and horses, and a great many Elephants.
fn that hot country, so many
men and animals, of course, drank large
quantities of water every day, so that
when the summer came wi h its dry winds,
it was found that the tanks, or ponds,
hegan to fail, and were after a while entirely
dry. At these ponds, the cattle and
Elephants always drank, so that when ih"y
were dried up, there was no water, except
in the wells, which in that country are
very large, being ten or twelve f et across.
At one ol these wells, on which they chiefly
depend for water, there was a constant
crowd of men and anmals, all thirsty, and
each one anxious to drink before the other,
so that there was often much confusion,
and sometimes hard words among the men
who came to water the beasts.
One day, two Elephant keepers, each
with his Elephant, came as usual after water.
One of these animals was very large,
and the other small and weak A bucket
Ko/t hoon <rivcn the *mill rmt* bv his keener
UHVI ?UV M ^ * J I
which he carried on the end of his trunk,
but he large one had no bucket, nor had,
hiskeepor any, with which to draw up the
water. 1 he large Elephant being thirsty,
and wanting to drink first, and seeing that
the bucket was in possession of his weaker
brother was in his power, seized it and took
it away irom his poor fellow servant, who
was probably as thirsty as himself. Toe
smalt Elephant knew Ins own weakness too
well, to try to take his bucke; again, or to
pun sh such an insul' by open violence?.
He therefore, for thw present, remained
quiet, probably thinking to take his revenge
in some other way. The keepers, however,
quarrell d between themselves, and
offered each other much abuse, because he
master of the small Elephant thought the
other keeper told his animal to take away
the bucket. While they were quarrelling,
the small Elephant was watching the large
one, and seeking a chance to punish him
for the insult; and seeing him happen to
turn his side towards the well, he drew
back a few steps, to give i.imself more
force, and then rushing forward with all
his might, struck his enemy such a terrible
blow, as to pitch him fairly into the well.
Such an accident to the fountain on
which s"> many people depended lor water,
gave great alarm to'he officers and others,
for no one saw how the huge animal
could be raised out, and therefore th**\

spoil the water. The well, down to the
water where the elephant lay, was abou'
twenty feet deep, and the depth of water
below him, was considerable ; so that he j
floated on the surface; and not being hur' I
by the fall seemed highly to enjoy so cool
and comfortable a place, and made no exertions
to get out. After some time spent
in conirivtng what course could be t?kei?
to raise the an.ma! out,without hurting him
his keeper theught it could be done by siiik
ing fascines under h.m, aud thus gradually
raising him to the top of the well. Fascines
are bundles of small wood or brus
bound together, and aie used by armies
to fill up ditches or small s'reams of water.

ttthen titer ? are no bridge?. A vast num. I
bur of such biin?i!?-s iiaJ been prepareJ by
the army, to be used in this siege, and
permission was given by the officers to use
them on this occasion. But who would
believe that the elephant could be made
to know how to uso them, for in order
to raise him up, they must be piled, one
bundle on the other, in a manner so firm
and regular as to bear his great weight
when standing on them. His keeper,
soon taught liim his lesson, and made him
understand what he must do with the
fascines, so that when they were lowered
down to him, the sagacious creature took
them one by one, and placed them under
him, until, in a short time, he was able
to stand upon them. Seeing now that there
was no danger, and thinking that he could
get out when lie pleased, the cunning brute
determined to enjoy tho pleasure of his
coo! situation u little longer, and therefore i
refused to proceed with his work; nor!
coulJ al! the scolding, or threats of his keep, j
cr make him place ano her fascine under J
him. Finding that thcie was no use in j
trying to drive him, the keeper was obliged
to be as cuuning as his Elephant. He
therefore began to soothe him. He praised
h m for what he had already done, and
promised him plenty of brandy, or arrack, |
hquors of which this animal is very fond,
if lie would go and finish his work. The
knowing creature, flattered by snch praises, j
and encouraged by such promises, again i
went to placing iue fascines under him,
with such diligence, as soon to raise hitn>
self so high, that by taking away some of
the stones, on one side of the well, he was
able to step out unhurt.
From the New York Observer.
ORIGIN* OF MORMONISM. I
The Book of Mormon, or " Golden Bible,"
it would seen, is the production of the
Rev. Solomon Spaulding, a gentlenran of
Dartmouth College, and formerly pasior of
a Presbyterian church on the Western Reserve
in 0 iio. While suffering under disease,
to amuse himself and his friends, he i
wrote an imaginary history of the race of
men who built the ancient mounds and other
works of art, which are scattered so profusely
over the valley of the Mississippi.
His manuscript falling into the hands of
wicked and designing ir.en, has been perverted
into the means of buildimg up the
new sect of fanatics, who are making so
much noise in the West. The Rev. John
Storrs, of HoKiston, Mass., learning that
t..e widow of Mr. Spaulding (now Mrs. Davison,
having, since the death of Mr. S.
married a second husband) was stiil living
at Mons >n, Mass., and could testify
to this fact, addressed her a letter, and obtained
the following narrative, which we
copy from the Bosion Recorder.
As this book has excited much attention
and has been put by a certain new secr, in
the place of the sacred Scriptures, I deem it
a duty wbich I owe to the public, to state
what I know touching its origin. That its
claim to a divine origin is wholly unfounded,
needs no proof to a mind unperverted by
the grossest delusions. That any sane
person should rank it higher than any other
merely human composition, is a matter of 1
the great-st astonishment; yet it is received
as divine by some who dwell in enlightened
New England, and even by those who have
sustained the character of devoted Christians.
Learning recently, that Mormonisni
f/?nn<l itc u-av/iMtn a church in Massa

cliusi tls, and has impregnated some of its
m -cnbers with its gross delusions, so that
excommunication has become necessary, I
um iiet ?rmined to delay no long r doing
what 1 can to strip the rn isk from this moi..
ster of sin, and to lay open tins pit ofabom11
itions.
R v. Solomrn Spaulding, to whom I was
united in marriage in early life, was a graduate
of Dartmouth College, and was distinguished
for a lively imagination and a great
fondness for history. At the time of our
marriage, he resided in Cherry Valley, N.
Y. From 'his place we removed to New
Suiem, Ashtabula coun'y, Ohio ; somet-mes
called Conneaut, as it is situated upon Conneaut
Creek. Shortly after our removal to
this place, his health sunk, and he was laid
aside fiom active labors. In the town of
New Salem, there are numerous mounds
and forts, supposed by many to be the dilapidated
dw llings and fortifications of a
race now extinct. These ancient relics arrest
the attention of the new settlers and be.
come objects of research for the curious.?
Numerous implements were found, and
other articles evincing great skill in the arts,
Mr. Spaulding, being an educated man and
passionately fond of history took a lively interest
in these devc lopments of antiquity ;
and in order to beguile the hours of retirement
and furnish employment for his lively
imagination, he conceived the idea of giving
an historical sketch of thai long lost race.? j
Tneir extreme antiquity of course would
lead him to wrie in the most ancient style,
and as the Old Testament is the most ancient
book in the world, he imitated its style
as nearly as possible. His sole object in
writing this historical romance was to amuse
himself and his neighbors. This was about
the year 1312. Hull's surrender at Detroit
occurred near the same time, and I recollect
ihe date well from that circumstance. As
lie progressed in his narrative, the neigh
hors wouid come in from time to time to
near portions read, and a great interest in
the work was excited among them. It
claimed to have been written by one of the
lost nation, and to have been recovered from
me earin ana assumea tne title of "Manu.
script Found." The neighbors would often
inquire how Mr. S. progressed in deciphering
*'the manuscript," and when he had a
sufficient' portion prepared he would inform
hein and they would assemble to hear it
read. He was enabled from his acquaintance
wi:h the classics and ancient history,
o in roduce many singular names which
wf re particularly noticed by the peoplo and
. ould be easily recognized by them. Mr.
Solomon Spaulding had a brother, Mr. John
Spudding, residing in the place at the time,
who wa? perfectly familiar with this work
and repeatedly heard the whole of it reaJ.
From New Silcm. we removed to P/?ts.;
burgh Pa. Here Mr. S. found an acquaint- ii
anccand friend, in the person of Mr. Pat* 7
terson, an editor of a newspaper. He ex- s
hibited his manuscript to Mr. P. who was d
very mnch pleased with it, and borrowed it t!
for perusal. He retained it a long time and t
informed Mr. S. that if he would make our c
a title page and preface, he would publish a
it and it might be a source of profit. This s
Mr. S. refused to do for reasons which I e
cannot now state, Sidney Rigdon, who has t
figured so largely in the history of the Mor- c
rnons, was at this time connected with the i
printing office of Mr. Patterson, as is well i
known in that region, and as Rigdon him- r
self has frequently stated. Here he had t
nmnlo nnnnr nnitv to become acnuamfed *
- j -- 1
with Mr. Spauldmgs manuscript, ana to
copy it if he chose. It was a matter of notoricty
and interest to all who were connected
with the printing establishment. At
length the manuscript was returned to its
author, ?nd soon after we removed to Amity,
Washington county Pa., where Mr. S. died
| in 1816. The manuscript then fell info
! my hands arid was carefully preserved. It
has frequently been examined by my daugh.
ter, Mrs. McKensiry, of Monson, Mass.,
with whom I now reside, and by other
friends. After the "Book of Mormon" came
out, a copy of it was taken to New Salem,
the place of Mr. Spaulding's former residence,
and the very place where the "Manuscript
Found" was written. A woman
preacher appointed a meeting there, and in
the meeting read and repeated copious extracts
from the "Book of Mormon." The
1 historical part was imm"diately recognised
by all the older inhabitants, as the identical
| work of Mr. S., in which they had been so
deeply interested years before. Mr. John
Spaulding was present, who is an eminently
pious man, and recognized perfectly the
work of his brother. He was amazed and
afflicted, that it shouid have been perverted
to so wicked a purpose. His grief found
vent in a flood of tears, and he arose on the
spot and expressed in the meeting his deep
sorrow and regret, that the writings of his
sainted brother should be used for a pur.
pose so vile and shocking- The excite,
ment in New Salem became so great, that
, the inhabitants had a meeting, and deputed
Dr. Philastus Hurlbut,one of their number,
i ii.ic ,tl:.no nnH to nhfain from me
w ir|mn iu mm |JI"WW uwu ,v
the original manuscript of Mr. Spaulding, 1
for the purpose of comparing with the Mor- t
mon Bible, to satisfy their own minds ana \
to prevent their friends from embracing an t
error so delusive. This was in the year \
1834. Dr. Hurlbut brought with him an r
introduction and request for the manuscript, p
signed by Messrs. Henry Lake, Aaron p
Wright and others, with all whom I was
acquainted, ns they were my neighbors I
when I resided in New Salem. p
I am sure that nothing could grieve my (
husband more, were hi living, than the use c
which has been made of his work. The ^
air of antiquity which was thrown about the n
composition, doubtless suggested the idea of p
converting it to purposes of delusion. Thus tl
an historical romance, with the addition of a c
few pious expressions and extracts from the s
sacred Scriptures, has been construed into ?
a new Bible, and palmed off upon a com- s
pany ofpoor Ji luded fanatics, as divine. I *
have given the previous brief narration, that e
this work of deep deception and wickedness t
may be searched to the foundation, and its ii
author exposed to the contempt and execra- n
tion he so justly deserves. tl
The Rev. Dr. Ely pastor of the Congre. a
g.ationnl church in Monson, and D. R. Aus- li
tin, principal of the Monson Academy, i.avo a
given their certificate ti at Mrs. D. is *'a c
woman of irreproachable character, and a p
humble Christian, and that her humble testimony
is worthy of implicit confidence." li

lottery advertisements. t
We declared, some time ago, our inton- r
tion not to publish any Lottery Advertise- t
ment, and at the same time returned one,
with the money forward to pay for it. We x
have now received one, of two columns in r
size, from Sylvester & Co. of N. York, I
in their paper, denominated '* Sylvester's c
New Reporter* with the following notice c
at the foot of it: s
" ([J* Editors of every paper in the n
United States, in the West In ies, in Can- c
ad.?, and other of the British Provinces, are g
requested to insert the above, as a standing s
advertieement, uniil the 1st December next, n
and to send their account to us, together v
with a paper containing the advertisement, n
SYLVESTER & CO. i,
Mdy 7th, 1839. 156 Broadway, N. Y." f
This advertisement would cos', in our I
paper, $213 75 cents. The number of v
newspapers ordered to publish it, cannot be r
less, we presume, than 1,000, at the very n
lowest caculation ; and as our prices are C
much lower than the average of prices gen- a
crally, the mt:re cc#of the advertisement tl
n, 1,000 papers, must be at least $213,.. '
'50 00 * Two hundred and thirteen thou. J

lo Messrs. Syxvester <sLCo. design to pay .
his ? They are certainly liable for it, since
iohing is said about a deduction ; and, ac~
:ustomed as they must be to advertising,
ind publishing, as they do, a paper themlelves,
they must be as able as ourselves to
tstimate the probable cost. But, suppose
hev honestly design to pay, and ob ain a
leduction, in each instance, can it be more,
n the aggregate, than one half? Supposing
t so very large, still it would leave them
n >re than 8100,000 to pay. Do they mean
o pay such a sum, or even one-fourth,
wnnld he over $50,000 ? If they do,
vhat must be the general profits of Loiteres,
and what the chances, of ihe egregious
Jupes who encourage them ? Talk of
gambling?wo believe thero is no gambling
,vorse, more delusive, mischievous, d'-mor..
ilizing aud ruinous, than Lotteries! In our
brmer notice of the subject, we illustrated
heir deadly influences, and gave instances
vi bin our own knowledge, of the misery,
"uin, and crime, occasioned by them.
It is time for the public to reflect on this
subject, especially parents and guardians,
tnd to consider whether they will longer tol?rate
such a curse?such a fascinating vor
ex of ruin and shame, to their children and
vards. We particularly .appeal to the
Press! Will it longer permit itself to be
nade the lure and pander of a vice so de..
usive, mischievous, and demoralizing??
lolding forth the fascinating temptations of
hese gambling shops, before the eyes of all
heir readers ? Is there a single editor that
ioubts their deadly influence? Not one !
Why, then, should any one suffer his coL
imns to be disgraced and perverted by |
hem ? For the sake of a few dollars?or
ather, the mere a chance" of them?for
ve need not say to the conductors of the
tress, how faithfully or liberally such adverisememeflts
are generally paid for ? And
s any editor so low, that he would prostitute
lis press to acknowledged evil, for such a
tonsidaration. Was the press es ablished
or such purposes, or can it maintain its
iroper character and influence,in connexion
vith them ? And is it enough tor an ocuior
o say, while he condemns lotteries, ihat
te is not accountable for wnat appears in
is advertising columns ? As well might
in unfeeling vender of liquors, to those
vhom it infuriates and maddens ; or poison,
o the inexperienced and unwary, say lie ;
vas not accountable for its effects ; or the I
nan who rents his house for gambling pur>oses,
or a brothel, that he is no wise resjonsible
for the wickedness done in it.
It is gratifying to witness what has already
)een done on th s subject , and we trust the
jood work will go on, till it is completed,
jeorgia has prohibited lotteries, and lottery
idvertisements, also, under severe penalities.
Virginia, also, by an act of her last Legislaure,
has prohibited loiieries, after a brief
eriod ; and this State has inflicted a t*?x on
hem, amounting to prohibition. This suffi.
:iently marks the feeling and policy of our
Irate, us dooicUdly opposed to lotteries ; and
is every good citizen will yield a reudy as.
ent to the laws, and the will of the people,
ve trust that the press will not set an evil

IMPORTANT DECISION. ,n
Supreme Court.-"This cour; decided yes- P1
eiday in the case of the Atchafalaya Bank 1'
's. Dawson, that the forfeiture of bank char,
ers by the suspension of specie payments S1
loes not accrue to individuals or to any ~"
lerson or party, but the State which gave
hem ; and it alone can avail of forfeiture P
ind takeaway the charters. That although R
>y a clause in the charter of the Atchafa- in
aya Bank and some others in case of sus- af
>ension of specie payment for 90 days, the bi
Jg
iarter is ipso facto forfeited, yet the Bank
jntinues to exist, and can sue and be sued
itil the State choose to institute proceedigs
and take from it its charter. In other
ords, that Bank charters are contracts
Btween the S;ate wh'ch grant9 and the
jrporators or stockholders who accept and
tceives them.
In the case before the court the bank
ted the defendant for a debt due it, after
ie suspension of its payments in specie for
tore than 90 days. The defendant filled
a exception denying the capacity of the
ank to sue or stand in judgment by its coronate
name. The judge of the First Dis.
ict Court was of thia opinion ; sustained
te exception and dismissed the suit. The
auk appealed. The supreme court re.
I ~ ~ #
ersed the judgment of the district court;
eclared the Bank had capacity to sue and
manded the case for a new trial.
The judges delivered separate opinions.
Mart n, the presiding judge, was of opin*
>n that as the Legislature had at its last
ssion exercised its power and remitted the
irfeii res of all the bank charters, it was
nnecessa-y 10 decide the question of for*
;iiure and go into an inquiry about this
lanncr of proceeding in declaring such for*
;i?ure.

IMPROVEMENT OF THE MISSOURI RIVER.
We have been gratified by witnessingthe
ficient operations of the United States
mg.boat Heliopolis, in removing snags,
iwyfTS and logs from the channel of the
lissouri river. The boat is under the com*
tand of Cuptain Smith, and has about thirty
ands on board, and works with great pow.
r and effect. Its engine, timbers, chains,
ad all i s work, ore of the s'rongest desription
; its machinery is simple, but pow.
rful; and its crew operate with great skill
gulurity and celerity. It raises out of the
ludorsand the largest'trees, and draws
lem out by the roots ; they are then speally
sawed into pieces, and permitted to
oat with the current. Some idea of the
>wer of the boat may be formed from the
ct that a tree four feel thick at the root,
id eight feet long, which has long laid
laking in the Missouri river, ca , with the
most ease, be entirely extricated, aod in
few moments, cut in pieces and sent down
e stream. Many such trees have been
imoved in the vicinity of St. Charles. The
iat has been about fifteen days operating
i the Missouri river, and has removed the
rincipal snags from the channel between
ie town of St. Charles and the mouth of
