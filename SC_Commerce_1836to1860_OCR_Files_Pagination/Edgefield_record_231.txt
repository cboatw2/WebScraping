Kentucky Legislature.-The resolutions
upon the subject of abolition, which first
passed the Senate, have been adopted by
the House of Representatives.
One of the provisions of the resolutions,
is, that two Commissioners shall be ap
pointed by a joint vote of the two Houses
of the Legislature, to proceed to Ohio, lay
before the Legislature of that State, the
views of Kentucky, in regard to this ques
tion, and ask of it the enactment of such
laws,as will tend to the suppression of the
evils growing out of the interference ofcer
tain fanatics in Ohio, with the Slaves of
Kentucky.
North Carolina, U. S. Senators. Messrs.
Broton and Strange.-Shortly after the re
veption of the Anti-Sub-Treasury resolu
tions passed by the North Carolina Legis
iature, et its recent session, Messrs. Brown
and Strange wrote a letter to the General
Assembly, stating that they did not know
the meaning of the Resolutions. These
gentleiben acknowledge the right of in
struition. The General Assembly replied
by thefollowing Resolution, which passed
its third reading 25 to,23.
"Resolved, Thnt the Resolutions passed
by this General Assembly, and transmeited
to our Senators in Congress, are sufficient
lyplain and intelligible to be comprehen
dedby any one desirous of understanding
them; that we believe this communication,
anticipating the reception of said Resolu
tions and making enquiry as to their mean
ing, is not in good faith; and that it would
be inconsistent with the self-respect of this
General Assembly to make any reply to it."
Delaivare.-In the House of Represen
- tatives of this State, Joseph Maull, Whig,
lately received a majority or votes for the
U S: Senate. Late accounts stare that
the Legislature fixed on the 17th inst. for
the election.
Massachusetts.-The Hon. Daniel Web
star has been re-elected United States
Senator, from Massachusetts. for the term
of six years, from the 4th of March nbxt.
Mis4ippi.-Ia Lowndes county, Mr.
Tucker, (V. B.) has been lelected State

Congress, has been elected to the Legis
laturg, from Montoe county.
Gold Eagles.-The Globe says that the
Mint in Philadelphia, is making Gold En
gles. None of this coin has been cast
since 1804.
Florida.-A Convention recently as
sembled at St. Joseph, Florida, and adop
ted a Constitution for Florida. Robert
Raymond Reid was President of the Con
vention.
Piracy.-Some months since, en attro
cious piracy .was committed by the Ma
lays,_in the Indian seas, on an American
vessel,:the Sclipse. Several men-of-war
* started out shortly afterwards, in pursuit,
~'and have probably chastised the pirates ore
this.
Horse-thieve.-We call the attention
of the public, to the advertisement of Mr.
Geo. Anderson, inserted ini to-day's paper.

RICE PLANTATIONS!!
Mr. Editor :-What an astonishing
thing is it,that somec people wish to appear
rich, and even express themselves in such
a manner as to be thought so by others;
-when indeed, if the truth were known, the
__ nost that could be said of them is, that they
-are like the animals of the shell tribe?
During the Summer of 1837, a company
of Ladies and~ Gentlemen visited one of
the Sulphur Springs in the npper country,
in order, I suppose,to improve their health.
One of the Ladies being presented with., a
a cup of the water, exclaimed, "dear me!
it smells just like the ditch water in one of
Father's rice plantations,"!! and 'oehold! it
was ascertained that he did not own even
one such plantation, much less, two or
more, as she intimated. A.
C'aricature.-We have receivcd from
Washington, an amusing carienture print,
representing Mr. Forsyth. stopping hais
nose, and introducing to President Van
Buren. the Marquis De Quashipomnpo,
Envoy Ertraordinary, and Mini :JI~ -
-potentiary from the Sister Rep
Hayti. This is the right way to t he
late specimen of united follyr and wekd
ness on the part of the abolitionists. Such

drive the propositIon, with "inextinguish
able slaughter" from the land.-Chsarles

Co1n, in the ninety-ninth wear of his age,
(born 21st September, 1740, on the Island
of Nantucket.) Until within the Iasi year,
he was active and prompt in bodily exer

of about four weeks' duration, being the
natural decay of the system. "He was the

this city-discharging the duties with sat
isfaction to his constituents and honor to
himself. He had long been an intelligent
ship master of bterling integrity, until he
finally discontinued the seas, at about 60
years of age.
In the winter of 1774, he had for passen
gers to London, the consignees of the Tea
then recently destroyed in Boston harbor.
Thatso much worth should be early "ought
for, might well be expected; the same year
he was invited to dine with Dr. Fothergill,
in company with Dr, Franklin and a Brit
ish peer, in London, thus becoming early
initiated in the views,feelings and anticipa
tions of those true friends of the American
Colonies, he at once came out a firm sup

Court had manifested towards America.
He was twice a prisoner during the wai

enjoyed the most friendly relations with the
most prominent tnen of the present day,

The Book Making Business.-The fol
lowing is an extract from a lecture on
printing delivered some time since before
the Portsmouth Lyceum, anti afterwards
published. After speaking of the estab
lishment of the Harpers, at New-York. the
author says, "At Brattleboro," in our sie
te~r State, Vermont, is one which is de
serving of notice. The printing establish
ment there keeps in operation several
power presses. Connected with itis a pa
per mill at one end,&a book hindery at the
other, so that, (like the chrysalis, changing
of a vile caterpiller to a beautiful butterfly,
what enters at one end, she cast off cover
ing of the human body, is. by a regular
and rapid change brought out at the other
extremity, beaitiful paper, finely printed
and bound-a material for the permanent
dress of the immortal mind. So rapid is
the progress that rags have been received at
the mill in the morning, manufactured into
paper, and printed before night. 'T he
"Comprehensive Commentory" is now
printing at that establishment, When it
is completed it will have consumed fifteen
thousand reams of paper Think riot that
the woolen or cotton manufactures are the
only ones which henefit the agrictultural
ist, for this one work will use the amount
of a thousand bales of cotton in paper-and
will have required the skins of sixty thou
sand sheep for its hinding!
We understand that during the five years
ending with the present, there will h,tve
been published at this establishment about
one hundred and sixty thousand imperial
ocRavo volumes. averaging more than eight
hundred pages each? The volumes con
rain each more than ten of the average of
those issued by the Harpers, the lamgest
publishing house in America-making an
amount of miatter issued, equal to one mil
lion six hundred thousand such volumes as
theirs? 'ht bssitess is now carried on by

ATLANTIC STEAM NAVIoATo.-The
Journal of Commerce says: "The last
passage of the Royal William has proved
th-it if steam vessels but take the South
ern rotate, they can cross the Atlantic as
well in winter as in summer. She ran
down within a hundred miles of Fayal. and
came up the Gulf Stream, and all 'round
found the weather so mild that no fire was
necessary in the cabin, except for a very
short time at each end of the voyage. The
sailors worked with their coats off and
bare foot. The Gulretrean keepe every
thing warm assummer, almost up to sound
ing oil our coast. The fact is. that the
world has hecome so small of late, that if
one feels cold here at the North, tie ha
only just to run down to the equator and
warm himself by the great fire,just as on a
smaller scale a dull urchin in Jiool runs to
the fire there. ''ern is tnotItag now in
the way of Atlantic steam navigation. rThe

now old Boreas blows his blast atnd scares
