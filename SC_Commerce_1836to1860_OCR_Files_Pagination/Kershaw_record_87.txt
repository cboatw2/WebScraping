CONFIDENCE AND CKED1E. '
The day was dark, the markets dull,
The 'Change was thin, Gaxettee were fall,
And half the town was breaking; '
The eoiiiit?Miirn nf p*?K 41 ? ""
Banker* and Bankrupt* shut up shop, *1
And honest heart* were aching. (
"When near the Bench, my fancy spied
A faded form, with hasty stride.
Beneath grief* burthen stooping? j
Her name was Credit, and she said, ^
Her father. Trade, was lately dead, ^
Her mother, Commerce, drooping.
The smile that she was wont to wear
Was withered by the hand of care,
Her eyes had lost their lustre ;
Tier character wus gone, she said,
Tor basely she had beer, betrayed,
And nobody would trust her.
That honest Industry had tried
To gain fuir Credit for hi- bride,
And found the l?dy willing; <
But aha Fortune-hunter camp, i
And Speculation was his name,
A Rake not worth a shilling.
The villain was on mischief bent,
lie gained both l)ad and Mam's consent,
And then poor credit smarted ;
lie filched her fortune and her lame? 1
lie fixed a blot upon her name,
And left her broken-hearted.
When thus poor Credit seemed to sigh
Her cousin Confidence came by,
(.Ylcthinks he must be clever ;)
For when he whispered in her ear,
{She checked the sigh, she dried the tear,
And smiled as sweet as ever.
O I Never let us Marry.
" We want no change, and least of all,
Such change as you would bring us.?Pizarro.

If in possession passion die
And when we marry love deny,
'Tis rapture still to tarry ; '
If that suit breast must cease to warm, 1
Those speaking eyes no longer charm, I
O never let us inarry
Jf 1 shall hang not on thy lip, ; (
.Like bees on roses when they sip, i j
And thence less honey carry ; j j
If 1 must cease to think it bliss ,
To breathe iny soal in every kiss,
O never let us inarry ! ||
A CHAPTER ON ECONOMY. V
There is not, probably, a more economical
nation in the world than the French. 01
There is nothing wasted in France. All t>
the fragments are gathered up and turned tl
to some good account. Articles which ?
are here considered entirely worthless, tl
and arc thrown aside as such, are hoarded tl
there with avidity, and by some happy e
tact, which only a Frenchman possesses, I
ore converted to some useful purpose. A
well gnawed bone, which an American
would toss to his dog, is transformed by P
the French cook into some delicate luxury.
The feet?the eyes, the combs, even .
the brains of fowls are by some mystic
process served up to tickle the palate in I1
the shape of different dainty dishes. An
American will purchase n line piece of e
beef and contrive to get two dinners? "
three, perhaps, from it, in the -shape of a
roast, a stew and a soup. Your Frenchman
would serve you up a dozen dishes r|
or more, and then dispose of the bone, |r
clean and clear as a whistle, to some tra- u
der in that article, to be transformed into jy
knife handles ? tooth-picks?toys, or ivory
black. There are many men and women r
who get a livelihood in Paris, by prowling lt
around the streets and l?ve-o\accs. in ..
* - \ II
search of rags, old iron, and small hits of I
paper, &c , which they hook out of the jj
rubbish, and by a dexterious movement j
place in a basket hanging ol their backs. ^
Nothing escapes their scrutiny?nothing ^
is too insignificant to be passed unnoticed,
but every scrap, every minute object,
which no one but a Frenchman would c
dream of regarding, is caught up as a n
prize. h
In these purse-trying times, it would i g
perhaps be well to take a lesson in ccono- f
my of the French. We should not wish |c
to see men and women poking about old f
ruhbisn for a subsistence, but wc would v
advise every body to look twice at a thing c
before it is thrown away. Take an old I
coat for example. True a patch on the t
elbow or cuff* is not quite so seemly ?but 1
then a patch on the elbow, utter all, is t
not so bad as a pat on the shoulder by a <
sheriff. The hatter's, the tailor's and the |
butcher's bill, we cannot escape?and yet
it would be well to dust the old coat anew
before wc get a new fit?brush up the old
hat again before we throw it aside for ever
and take a second peep into the pantry
before we order a fresh supply of provisions.
By so doing many a penny might
be saved?and in these times we cannot
look out too sharp for the small coin?the
larger coin are so scarce they do not
need watching-?N. Y. Paper.
Uncommon age of a IIokse.?Head, in
his Taur through the Manufacturing Districts
of England, mentions a horse
years of age, which worked all Ins life on
the tow path of one of the canals near
Manchester. Before his demise, he attain*
cd the honor of forming, decorated with

the coronation of his majesty King George
the Fourth.
Duel.?A fight took place on Tuesdny
afternoon at Irloboken, between a Spanish
nobleman and a French merchandize
broker, in consequence ot some misunderstanding
relative to " business transactions.*'
The Spaniard was badly wounded.
Marriage Brokers.?In Genoa there
ire marriage brokers who have pocket-books
ilh'd with ihc names of marriageable girls
>f the differeut classes, with 11 >tes of their
personal beauty and attractions, fortunes,
Slc. These brokers go about endeavoring
to arrange connection* ?n*t form matp.hp?

ind when they succeed, they get a percentage
of two or three per cent upon the
portion. Marriage at GeuoQ, is quite a matter
of calculation, generally settled by the parents
or relations, -who often draw up the
contract before the parties have seen one
an?'iher; and it is only when every thing
el>e is arranged, and a tew days previous tc
the marriage ceremony that the future hus
bai d is i troduced to Ins pailiicr for lite.

"Let no temptation induce you to join a
r< ligious society, f r the mere purpose oi
securing popt.l .rity. R< ligtoti is too awful a
subject to be bundled with impuniiy. ll
,vou approach it. speak of it with unatfected
lips; and touch it with unspotted hands
Remember, it is the great key stone ol
morals, which will fall, and crush y.rn tr
pieces if you come under it with insincerity
and unworthiness. Hypocrisy is the most
degrading, as well as dangerous, vice of humanity.
It lowers a man in his ow i estimation
; and will be sure, sooner or later, to
lower him in the estimation of every body
else."?M'ClcUan.
Unanimity.-?It was the sivinf? of An
thisthenes, that unity among the counsellors
was the most impregnable fortification of a
slate.
Micipsa, on his death-bed, admonished his
sons to he at unity among themselves 13v
unity, said he, a mole hill will become a
mountain, but by dissention a mountain a
mole-hill.
Many brooks meeting together in one,
makes a swelling and overflowing river; but
the greatest river may be so divided into
rills or rivulets, as to render it no longer
formidable.
Useful Recipt.?We every day hear
complaints about watery potatoes. Put
nto the pot a piece of lime as large as a
ten's egg ; and how watery soever the poatoes
may have been, when the water is
loured off, the potatoes will be perfectly
Iry and mealy. Some persons use salt?
vliich only hardens potatoes.
Men are born with two eyes, but with
nc tongue, in order that they should see
vice as much as they say ; but, from
leir conduct one would suppose that they
'ere born with 2 tongues and 1 eye ; for
Itosc talk the most, who have observed
ic least, and obtrude their remarks upon
very thing, who have seen into nothing.?

Anecdote of Sheridan.?There is a
ominun anecdote told of this celebrated
aan contriving to get a pair of boots when
le had not the money to pay for them, or
;ot d credit either. He ordered two nairs
rom two different cnspins to be sent to a
ertaiu tavern the same day and hour,with the
nil. One pair came, and he found fault
vith the right hoot, and directed the lad to
,arry it back and bid his master tree it a
ittle, leaving the left boot with htm. When
he second pair arrived he complained siini
laily of the left boot, giving the same direclions
to the messenger. Having now a pair
complete, he paid his tavern score and departed.

nore perfectly cleaning it. They can be made to
lontain from 20 to KiOsaws in a stand, and whether
imall or large, one hand will he sufficient to attend
them. The Gins have mechanical feeders and
(toppers attached to them, which free the cotton
Irom leaves, trash, dirt, &c. before it can reach the
saws, and by the thorough hackling operation it
-eceives from the feeders, which make two revolutions
to one of the saws, it is almost in a hall
zined state, bpfore it descends to the saw Bv a
very simple arrangement of a screw to each set of
jaates, on which the hoppers rest, and through
which the teeth of the feeders pass, they can be
made to teed slow or fast to suit the condition of

saws are placed on two sets of cylinders and turn
upon each other in opposite direct ons, and are
cleansed by twosptsol brushes that have four revolutions
to one of two Raw. The two cylinders can
be detached so as to enable th? planter to run one
or both at pleasure, although embraced with feeders,
t&c. in one stand. The whole is put in operation
with a drum and band, as in the ordinary Gin, and
may be propelled by horse, steam, or water power.
It may also be propelled bv iron running gear.
The lorce required to work it. is about the same as
that necessary to move an equal number of saws in
the common Gin. This Gin lias been put in |
operation in New Orleans for two or three weeks,
and its success tested in the presence of a large
number of planters, merchants and others, and
received their general approbation
Several gentlemen have been ho kind as to give
the Patentee their written opinion respecting the
merits of the Gin. A number of others could be
added, but the following are deemed sufficient:

to sav. that I saw it work on Saturday the2<r)lh inst.
and was very much pleased with its perlormance.
The mere fact of its self-feeding, seems to rne to
be a very valuable improvement ; and besides, the
quality of the cotton, as it comes out of the process,
appeared to me lobe better and clenner than
from the common Gins in use, and that it saves
considerably in labor. Respectfully, &c.

exhibits a decided improvement on the usual process
of ginning ; delivering the staple uninjured
ana iree iroin nap rir trash, clean and of good co~
lor ; thereby giving the article an additional value.
These favorable impressions of the advantages of
your Patent Gin, have been confirmed by subsequently
witnessing it in operation. The utility of
the double cylinders and saving of labor, will be
readily perceived and properly appreciated by the
intelligent planter.
Peeling a deep interest in tire success of all improvements
tending to benefit the important staples
of our country, 1 trust that yours Will meet with
the encouragement it justly merits.
Very respectfully, vour ob t serv't,

From Mr. G. Senior, a Machinist of New Orleans.
Dr. A Jo^es?Dear Sir, in answer tc your inquiry
of my opinion of your Patent Cotton Gin, I
beg leave to state,*that 1 was-fifteen years engaged
in the cotton factories of Manchester. England,
and during four years of that time, ! was
foreman in the house of Messrs. Lewis, Williams
At Co., and near five years spinner in the house of
Messrs. Sandford & Greene. J have seen your
Cotton Gin in operation, and have examined iho
cotton ginned by it, and pronounce it better cleansed,
and the staple less injured, than any cotton
that ever came under my observation. It is completely
rea-'y for the breaker without the aid of the
blower, and would, therefore, save the first process
in manufacturing the article. 1 consider cotton
cleansed by your Gin, would command from on?
to two cents on the pound more than the average
crops brought into the Manchester market, and
'cleansed by common Gins Yours, very resp'ly.
N. Orleans. March 0, GEORGE SENIOR.
Dr. Jones?Dear S r, in answer to your ii quiry
respecting my opinion of your Patent Cotton Gin,
I have to state, that 1 have been engaged in putting
up the Carver <tins for planters on Red River,
and that 1 have seen your Gin in operation, and
have examined the quality of the cotton produced
by it; 1 consider it equal if not superior to the Carver
Gins: in addition to which, 1 think your feeders
a decided improvement, and by the aid of
which, the quality of the cotton cleansed appeals
much improved, over that produced by the common
Gins. Yours &c. S. BENNETT.

of planters in any of the sea port towhs of the cot*

It is desirable, when planters give orders for Gins,
they should accompany them with their views io
regard to the arrangement of saws, breasts, brushes,
&ic. It is found they differ in opinion. Some
desire saws of larger diameter than others. The
most common size is 9 or 10 inches ; but some wish
them 12 inches. Some wish 5 or 6 rows of brushes
on an axle, while others do not want more than 4
at inoit. Some wish saws with 8 or 9 teeth to tho
inch, while others want 10 or 11. With so much
discrepancy, we prefer they should, at the time oi
giving orders, furnish a statement of their wishes,
and the inanufacturerers can fulfil them in every
particular. Where it is left to our discretion, wo
shall make them on the most modern and approved
plun An order can be executed, from the time it
is received, in the space of eight or nine weeks,
and the Gin in that time phced in the hands of the
factor. To he in time for the next crop, all orders
ought to be in the hands of the manufacturers by
the first or middle of May ; except for plantations
where they are late in commencing to pick or gin
cotton.
N. B.?The Patent Right, for any one of the
cotton growing Slates, will be sold on reasonable
terms. May C 1 ?
