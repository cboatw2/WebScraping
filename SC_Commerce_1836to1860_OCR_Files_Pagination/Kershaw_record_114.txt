fallowed speculations,'1 ! hope aud believe
our government had no hand in it,
or even winked at it in any manner.
As to the Young Planter's ''sending for
persons and papers" to convict the administration,
in participating in the unhallowed
speculations of the West, such an
idea never entered my mind, nor did I
think he would have quoted Mr. Wise as
authority to establish "that there was
something: rotten in Denmark." I consider
Mr. Wise's prejudices has distroyed
the cnart of his understanding, or that he
never had read the sixth article of the
amendments to the Constitution of the
United States. The investigating committee
of which Mr. Wise was h member,
did "send for persons and papers," and
proceeded as far as they were constitutionally
authorised; but their prejudices
did not urge thorn to incur guilt, by trampling
on the cons'itntion thej were sworn
to support. Av>ain the Young Planter
says, "I must concur with the Old Farmer
that there has been ruinous speculations
and some overtrading, but when that is
usged as the cause, 1 n.ust record mv
dissent. There is a primary cause for
o^ery thing? let us probe the matter, and
see if the government bad no agency in
it. 1 think it would appear that it was
noi simply four millions employed in
the West, but actually tint sum multiplied.
To impose this view of the subj-Tt 1 will
suppose B. to draw $5,000 from tire
Bunk, (paper money, I guess) to-day; tomorrow
he may go the land oflice^and enter
his locations, paying up the money.
This sum is transferred io ihe Bank again,
perhaps in a few days, and by this transaction
it becomes public deposites to be
loaned out to C. or any other applicant."
I am glad to be concurred with in my
opinion that ruinous speculations and
overtrading, and I will add another, that
I conceive equally important in producing
the present distresses of our country,
and that is, the fall of Cotton from $18
to $9 per 100; and "pr-ibe" as we may,
ami hunt for primary causes" until our
brain anil eyes fail us, and it will he
found that ''go to," I will he rich, and
profusion is the true cause of nil our monetary
distress; and that the government
bad "neither part nor lot in the matter."
As to the Bunks lending B. $5,000 to locate
his land, and C's borrowing it again,
and so on ad infinitum, there is no proof
that the government had any hand in it,
nor could it prevent it with the eyes of
Argus.
If the Banks encouraged adventurous

ernmcnt had any tiling t > do with it, nor
can I be induced to believe it had.
Let us lav our present distresses at the
ri??Vitk'/WVJ, w\ not. be bunting excuses
for our own imprudence, and parVmg Vi
on our government, when ourstdves are
entirely to blame.
As long as we anticipate high prices
for our staple articles of produce, we
seem destined to run into prolusion, and
reckless speculations; and when the produce
falls, we will always be in pecuniary
difficulties: This has always been the
case.
Again the 44 Young Planter" Rays, 441
do not conceive thai there is any express
grant of power in the constitution for
a National Bank, but the power is explicitly
conceeded to t'nngress to coin money,
ami regulate the value thereof, pass
laws, &c." The tenth section of the
first article of our constitution speaks for
iiself, and may God forbid it should ever
speak otherwise. If it ever does, our bci._

To coin, 4< is to make money, to forge,
invent," according to my Dictionary;
and rags and printed promissory notes is
out of the question in a constitutional
point of view. Let the States make rag
money, but let the General Government
stick ch>se to constitutional currency.?
When our government is involved in a
public debt, it may be expedient, hut not
constitutional, to rreate a United States
Bank for a limited time, and when the
debt is paid, and the Charter expires,
then let the government fall hack to the
lawful currency.
When the government receives nothing
for its dues but (lie le al currency, it will
check in a degree, the inordinate issue of
the Stales rag money. I am kindly invited

CAMDEN, S. C. AUGUST 12, lb37.
Tur Mails.?For the last week or two, the
mails have arrived with the inost systematic irregularity,
that is, when they came at all. But it
seeins that we axe to have no Jurther newspaper
| communication will Charleston, at least with the
| Courier. To day (Friday) is a week since the
1 Courier has been received, and there are now
three (oi the country paper) due. This is too
| bad, particularly when the di?t?v.:"e is so short,
: and we have two mails direct, and three via Columbia,
weekly. Is there no way by which this
. evil could be corrected? I
? I
For the last two or three weeks, the weather has
been quite unsettled, with an uppareui probability
of our having as great reason to complain of too
much rain, as we #id sometime since of the warn
of it. Salurday last too was remarkably cold, and
fires and winter clothing were found quite comtortable.
|
Fatat. Rkkcountkii.?It has become our pain
ful duty to state that an affair of violence has
occurred in our generally orderly and quiet community,
which resulted in the immediate death
of one of the papties. On Sntorday last, a ren-j
conn'.er took place at the Post Office, between Mr.
Eldriogf. Brown and Mr. Francis S. Biionson,
in which the former was killed. From what had
passed between these individuals the evening ptevious,
tiie rencounter was anticipated by both,
and both were consequently armed?Brown with
a Pistol and Bowie Knife,.and Bno.nson witli two
Pistols. Brown, who was the assailant on this
unfortunate occasion discharged his pistol first,
without efTect. Bronson fired both his with fatal
accuracy, the first ball entering the right shoulder,
and the second, the left eye of the deceased.!
A Our I.:- ?-? r> ..
..... . o inot jMsnii, uiiu^snx mrew u al the
deceased and struck him on the head, and it is
said, fractured his skull. Brows on receiving
the last shot, instantly tell, and although he lived
nearly an hour after, never spoke.
1) iOHSos immediately surrendered himself to
the civil authorities, and on a hearing of the case
before the Commissioners of special bail on Monday
last, l?e was admttted to bail, and bound over
I to answer, at our next court, the charge of Manslaughter.
We feel no disposition to comment on
j this melancholy affair, and the circumstances
which led to it, and if we did, it would not be
pmper for us to do so, before the subject is finally
disposed of by the laws of the land.
THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND.?It is upwards
of one hundred and twenty years, since England
has been governed by a Queen. Anne having
i been the last. The Duke of Cumberland, (fifth
I son) is the next heir to the Throne, Rhou'd the
i present Queen die without children, lie has one
son. The Duke of Cambridge has two children,
and these lour, including .One",*}. ?y/> \b/? ?ole
surviving' grand-children ot Georgf. III. The
Duke of Cumberland is now King of Hanover,
i and should the Queen have n family of her own,
it Is not likely that the succession of Hanover will
be again un'ted with that of Great Britain
I
i It is a remarkable lact however, that the reigning
Queens of England have all died without heirs,
j The nAUOiiTFRs of Gkorge 111, are all without
, children also'; and the Princess Charlotte*., only
daughter of George IV, who became the wile of
Leopold. King of Belgium, died during the first
year of her marriage, leaving no heir. It will not
therefore be out of the common course of events,
in the history of England, should the prince
, Gkorge Frederick, son of the King of Hanover,
yet become George V, of England !
We invite the ulteiiliou of our renders to the
following circular, which came directed to some of
I V.
our merchants, a lew days since The subject is
! one of vast importance to the whole South, and
1 we hope will meet a heurty response.
| " Sir,?A crisis lias arrived in tlie comI

I has occurred since the formation of the

i a singular advantage for any people to
enjoy. Yet, with all this in our favor,
| by nature, we en ploy the merchants of
I tl.e Noitliern cities as our agents in ibis
business. They export our immensely,
valuable productions, and import our articles

Thiii is not the first occasion upon which public t
attention has been called to this important subject,
and its great ad van'ages fully set forth. Gov.
McDuffie in his Message to the,last Legislature,
dwelt with great emphasis on this interesting subject.
In recommending strongly the establishment
of a Professorship of Modern Languages in the '
South Carolina t "ollrge, his principal design was
the education of men destined for mercantile pur* '
suits. He says?" It is an object of the first importance
to have a class of well educated merchants,
capable of conducting our immense and
increasing foreign commerce, who will save to
the State the large percentage which tlie Northern
merchants receive as a commission for exchanging
on productions for those of other countries." His
Excellency then goes on to say that circumstances
were then highly favorable for the accomplishment
so patriotic a purpose. They are certainly not less
so now, and the timed seem more imperiously to
demand that some action should be had on the subject.
We are pleased to Ree the question agitated
any where in the South, but regret that Sooth
Carolina has not followed up nnd carried out the
suggestion of Governor McDuffie. It i? not,
however, too late yet, and we hope the circ- lar
from Georgia will arouse public attention to the
matter.
The "Wanokrino Piper" having terminated
his travels in the character of a Minstrel, announces
to the public, through the New York Commercial
Advertiser, his real name, ALF.XANnr.it
GrFIIAM StUAR* Df. VeRK. His name is of
little consequence to us, since from our short acquaintance
with him, we have every reason to
believe him a gentleman. The efforts, therefore
of some, even of his own countrymen, to cast
reflections upon his conduct, are calculated to
excite nothing but contempt. A writer in the
Charleston Courier, who docs not hazard his
own name, asserts, that "he is a native Kirkcadbright,
a town in East Galloway, Scotland, and his
name is M'Donai.p?and in corroboration of my
statement, I think thorp area few Scotchmen in
this city whom he would be as unwilling to scp^
as he was to recognize when he made his appearance
here." Pretty "corroboration" truly, which
goes no farther than "I tiiink." Prey where was
this gentleman when Mr. Stuart was in
i m 1?* -
v/nuiifMiun. ? ny oki lie not unmask the impostor
then, if lie knew liim to be such ? We should
think that a man might at lenst, he allowed the
privilege of knowing his own name. When heref
he gave us hi* address as ' apt. Stuart, and since
lie lefl heie a highly respectable gentlemen, himself
a native of Scotland, while on a visit to this
place, mentioned the fuel, of his having seen him
in Scotland in tliec! nracter of a Minstrel, and it is
not at. all likely, that his own countryman could
have heen imposed upon by one whom the correspondent
of the Courier asserts to have heen
coMrELf.F.n to quit h s country, in consequence of
having "committed some act contrary to the laws."
Will the Courier writer tel what this act was?

Appalling Incident.?.V cbrrespen*
dent in kidgciield informs us that about
11 o'clock, during the thunder storm oil
Tuesday nig lit last week, a cherry tree,
standing about twenty feet from the house
of Mr. Walter Ilawley, in the west part
of that town, was strttek by lightning.?
A portion of the electric fluid parsed from
lite tree and entered a small bedroom at
the northwest corner of the house, in
which Mr. Ilawlcy was sleeping, and
killcMl him instantly. Ilis wife slept in
an a joining room and was uninjured.?
His son, Mr. Clinch Hawley, was slcepi
in?r with his wife and child in the abasement.
Another poilion of the electric
fliii11 appears to have passed nlo or the
south side of the house and entered the
stone wall which forms the east side of
the basement bedroom, and entered the
.room just above lite head of the bed
which tuns occupied hy the. husband, wife
and child The lluid passed from the
wall so Mrs. Uawley's bead, and from
thence to her htishand on the left, and her
little son, who lay upon her ri ht arm,
both of whom were killed hy the stoke.
Although Mrs. II. was severely injured,
and retains but an impc feci conciousness
of the occurrence, hopes are enteri..:
I r i
kiiim'ii di m?r tecovery. A lew hours after
she had been thus bereaved ol her
husband and son, 'which constituted the
whole of her family, she gave birth to a
child which appears healthy and promising.

Jack-oxville, July (X1.
Our pine woods have been on lire in
several quarter ins this vicinity, for some
days past. We saw them blazing on either
hand in coming up the river a week since;
and we now learn that the country south
and east of Juliugton creek, known as
New SwitzerlaaL has been put tinder contribution
by tn^nevoin ing element, for a
considerable distance, in either direction, i
The buildings at the plantations of the j
late Mr. Mottc, together, with the fences'
at Mr. Loring's place, are burnt, we are;
11. "**
torn, 10 the ground. The huildi.igs at [
Col. Hallows' plantation, and those also!
at Dr. Simmons' arc said to have hud a
narrow escape, the lire slaying itself vithin
a short distance only of those places, j
To persons hunting in these woods, or
possihiv to runaway negroes, we are indebted
for this addition, by means of fire,'
to the good work begun lam year, about
(this time, by our Indian friends.
Wc learn that some TiI tie damage was
'sustained at Maj. MeKay's plantation,
'Magnolia," a few miles south of this,
durin the thunder storm on Friday evening,
the 21st. Those who were present state
that the sky was perfectly clear over head
at the time, a small speck to the South
being alone observable. Map McKay's
dwelling house stood between the kitchen
on one hand, and a tall dead tree on the
other. The lightning struck the tree, and
passing without any injury over the dwelling
house, shattered the gable end of the
kitchen, a number of the boards of which
were also knocked off, and some negroes
who were in it stunned, though not otherwise
injured.
The coming campaign.?Six companies
of mounted men have recently been mustered
into the service of the United States,
in this place, to be in readiness for the
operations of the ensuing campaign ; and
subject, in the mean time to such duties as
circumstances may require. This regiment
is placed tinder the command of our
gallant fellow-ci'izcti, Col. John Warren,
whose distinguished military service s in
pr iltacled Seminole war, have won for
him a repute worthy of the name he
hears.

arisen since the close of General Jackson's term of
service, ihe undersigned have already made prepations
to furnish their annua! report in the form of

finished speeches prepared by the members themselves?they

This undertaking h ving. with these views, been
liberally patroni/ed by the public, it is our purpose

the Constitution?and the overthrow of the system
of revenue, both us a moans of adequate supply
