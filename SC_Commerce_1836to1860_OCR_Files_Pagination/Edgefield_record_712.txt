'BOW TO GET RICH.
Almost every man of businees has. been
rich, or at le'ast prosperotu, at some period
of his life, ad if he is poor now, he can
see very pell bow he might have avoid
ed the disaster which averthraw Ihis hopes
-He wI~probably see that his mislar
tnes arose frotm neglecting some of the
followitgles: Be industrious; every
body knows that industry is a fundament
al v'irtue in the man of business. But it
is not ever sort of indtusiry that tends ta
wealth: ~any -men work~btrd to do a
great deal of buisiniess, and after all make
les money than they would if they di
less. Industry should in expended in see
in to alt the details obbusiness; to care
fg6ishing tip ofoach separate underta
king, andio the maintainance of such a
system auwill keep every thing under cog
trol.
Be ecenotmical. This rule also is famil
iar to eveh~ol. Economy is a virtu'
o be padevery hour in a great city
It is to bepiretiedtn pence as in ponds
A sbillingaday saved amounts to an es
ta.t. nubertnrse of a life. Economy
especially important in the outset of life
until the foundation of un estate are laid.
Many men are pour all aheir days. because
when their necessary expenses were small
they did not seize the opportunity to save
a small capital, %% bich would change their
fortunes fur the whole of their lives.
'Stick to the business in which you are
regularly employed. Let speculators
make their thousands in a year or a day :
mind your own regular trade, never turn
ing from the right hand or the left. II you
are a merchant, a profre.aonal man or a
mechanic, never buy los or stocks unless
you have surplua money you wish t-) in
vest. Your own business you understand
as well as other peoples you do not under
stand- Lea your butsitess Ie some one
which is useful to couinoiry. Ali such
occupatrons pousscb ilc elment of' peioti
in themselves.
Never take great hizaris. Suc. haz
ards are seldom well balanced by the pro,
rects of profit; and if they were, the halb
it of mind n hich is indanecd i, uniavura-de
and generally tae result is tbad. To keep
what yo have, should be the first rule ; to
get what you fairly canl, the secoand.
Do not be in a hurr% so get rich. Gra
dual gains arc the only nutural gains, and
th--y who are in a lansac ito le re-t break o
ver sound rules, fall into temaafaation and
distress of various sorts, and generally fail
of their object. There i, na use in getting
rich suddenly. The man who keeps tst
business under his control, and saves 1om1e
thing from year to year, is always rich.
At any rate he potesses the highest eu
joytent which rictacs are able to atfurd.
Never do businrss for the sake of doing
it and being counted a great merchant.
There is often maore money to bo mado by
a smller hnsineas than at large oe, and
that busines nill in the end be fet-o, res
pectalle which is most succesftul. Do noat
get deeply in dce!.; but so taannge as al
wrays if possible, to have your financial
position easy, so that you call turn any
way yon please.
Do not love money exitava;:nntly. We
speak here, merely in refereace to getting
rich. Inu morals, the inordanate love of
money is one of the most degrading vices.
But he extravagant desire of accumula
tion. induces an eagernes. many times,
Jour. of Commerce.
Religious Melancholy.-Many persons
of a rellgious turn of mind, behave as if
they thought it a crime to be cheerful.
They imagine the whole of religion con
ssits in certain mortifications, or denying
themselves the smallest indlgence, even
of the must innocent amusements. A per
petual gloom hangs over their counten
ances, while lie deepest melancholy preys
upon th-ir initds. At lenagth tle fairest
prospects vanish. every thing uitais on a
dalm-al appearaance, and those very ob
jects wh.ich otght to gi'e delight. alTord
nothing ut di-gust. Life itself becoecs
a burden. and the unhappy wretch. per
saaded that no evil carn equtal n hat lie fe-l s,
ofiena puts ai end in his miserable eistence.
It is a great pity that evcr religion
should he so far pe verted as to become
the caus- of those very evils which it was
designed to eure. Naiehtig can be better
calcul:atl than tre Ieligion. ta raise
and sulport the minid of is vOtaries under
every afflictior that can befall thern. It
teacles na ant even thee -ufferings of
this life are preparatary to tie halliness

CoUrse of virtue shall at lent~l arrive at

Persons whise btsinerse it i, teo recanimend
:eligion to others, shouil beware (af dwell -
ing too much ont gloomy s1iujeats. That
peace and tranaquility of meiand, whiche true
religin is calcualatedh to intspire. is a naore
powerfual argumetat itt its favor thant ;all the
terrors thmnt ran be tanered. Terr-or may

have receently madle a fatnni anti somewhat

If this remiark w as nti mtndie uwemusly, it
indicates a loose mwrnhty, in referencee to
the oblligation, to ray debts contracted in
giuodt faith, which in is to be feared. is but
soni commotltn. A bankrupt or insolvent
law, dlischarges a m-i from the payment
of his debi's le;:ally but not morally. It
relieves him fromt the vexation of eheriffs
aind suits in court, but it does not relieve
him of the duty to pay his debts if ever
he is able. It is designed to relieve those
who are irretrievabily involved in debt;
who-e hantds are tied so that they cannot
help themtselves; who, the moment they
accumulate a little property to enable them
to trlansact biusiness, are liable to have' it
anatchted from him byv some creditors. To
relieve such persons bankrupt laws are in
tended, hut they are not tdesig ned to ro
wnove, or wipe out the just claim which
every creditor has to his honest dues. No
man can quiet his conscience with the be
lief that bsankrupi laws remove all obligs
tion to pay his debts, if prosperity enables
him to do it.-Hampshcire Ga:ete.
