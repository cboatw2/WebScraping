You look round for a moment or two as you
alight from the stage coach, step into the
shabby whiskey hotel, and impatiently inquire
how far it was to Lexington. And
here, let me say, that I never was so proud
of our neat and beautiful villages and pain,
ted farm houses, as since I was fairly on
my way to the great West. In travelling a
thousand miles, I have not met with a single
town which will compare with hundreds in
New England, New Jersey, and New York.
In parts of the country where the settler
has just begun to let the light of the sun
into the primeval forest, it would be unrea~
sonable to look for any thing more than
bare comfort; but in a section so old, and
so fertile as that part of Kentucky of which
i am now speaking, to see little else all day
long by the road side, but miserable log
-cabins, with no comforts or marks of improvement
around them, is surprising. !
icnow it may be said, that the best houses
re out of sight upon the middle of the plantations,
and we now and then caught a
glimpse of them, but still, if my eyes have
utterly deceived me, the majority of the

with; accommodations which the poorest
class at the east would think very indifferent,
if Qot quite intolerable.
- As-you leave Frankfort, you soon find
yourself entering the skirt of that fine rolling
section of country, having Lexington for
its centre, which is pronounced by all to be
the most beautiful section of the state, and
of which it would be difficult to speak in
terms of too high admiration. Should 1
find any thing superior to it in Illinois, or
Missouri, I shall not fail to confess it, but
for the present I must in justice say, that I
have never seen such majestic and luxuriant
woodland pastures, or rather parks, in any
country. They cover at least one third
part of the whole surface of several counties,
which is just undulating enough to give it
the highest beauty; and extend, it is said,
nearly thirty miles around Lexington.
It is impossible for me to do any thing
like justice to these primitive and towering
forests. The sycamore, the white and black
ash the tulip or poplar, the white and black,
walnut the oak and sugar maple, attain to a
prodigious size, and many of them rise to
the height of a hundred and fifty feet. In
their natural state, they are too thickly set
for pasturage, or for the highest beauty.
It is where one half or two thirds of the
trees are cleared away leaving the noblest
finp?i. ?hni vou have them in their mrent.
est majesty and perfection. It is theif that
tbess vust pleasure grounds are coverrd
with a velvet like and nutritious grass call*
ed blue grass; and though it will not fatten
to maiiy cattle, as if the trees were not there,
the difference, including dry season, is not
very great, and I am sure that infinitely
crtoio w gained in taste, comfort and beauty,
than b lost to dollars and cents.
Every ono who goes to England, speaks
with admiration, and justly, too, of the noble
parks and sbuded lawns of that country;
but they do not compare, and never can
compare at ?dl, uitliui in cAto?it,u? mugul*
Coon no, I? uihat nature has clone for this*
part of Kentucky. It only requires a mod* j
erate share df labor and taste to present to
the eye of the delighted traveller, hundreds
of thousands of acres of surpassing lovelt*
ness and majesty.- I have said nothing of
the vast corn fields, -which I saw on the
way, of early and rich promise nor -of the
ryo and barley, which are sure and plentiful
crops in and about Lexington. ' Because I
fear they destroy multitudes by being con*
verted into a deadly poison. But I will
take occasion here to say, that we at the
East, have no idea how easily sixty or
seventy bushels of corn can be raised to
* he acre. Whon once the land is well fitted
and planted, the light horse plough does almost
all the rest.
.Islington is one of the finest towns in
Kqptucky, and contains about five thousand
inhabitants. Many of the private
dwellings have a noble mansion like ap.
pearance, which is greatly heightened by
their deep court yards and spacious gardens.
The main building of Transylvania Uni.
versity is a handsome edifice and stands
upon a gentle and charming elevation.?
For several years the classical department
has languished; but the medical school is
represented as very flourishing.
But after all, Lexington is not half so
handsome and neat a town as I wish it was,
or as with the wealth and the taste of the
people it would be easy to make it. There |
are a. great many old and unsightly wooden
buildings of various sorts, which ought to
give place to new brick tenements. The
more wealthy citizens are planting them,
selves down one after another, in the parks]
of the vicinity, and turning their attention
more and more to the importation and raising
of cattle. Finer animals of the choicer
foreign and domestic breeds, cannot, 1 presume,
be found in the United States. The
Dresent high prices make tl?e business of
raising stock exceedingly profitable. To
ay nothing of taking $2000 for a cow,
which has lately been done in one instance,
from three to five hundred dollars for a calf
and so on in proportion, must soon make
those who have got the start in the business
. rich.
Happening to meet, and to be introduced
to Mr. Clay this morning, he very politely
invited us to call at his seat, a mile and a
half oat of town, which we did at 4 o'clock.
He received us with all the ease and urbanity
for which he is so much distinguished, and
entered freely into conversation upon a variety
of topics as they happened .to come
up. It is delightful to find a great man so
perfectly affable and unaffected; and indeed
this is one mark of true greatness.
Ashland is an enchanting spot. The mansion
is simple, spacious and venerable ;
standing just on the border of a park of
eighty acres, which for the majesty and
beauty of its thousand forest trees, is the
finest I ever saw. Mr. Clay has two other
woodland pastures, and in all something
like 800 acres in his farm. He has lately
: turned his attention very much to raising
rack, and it is ga'rt no man in Kentucky,
even, can show you finer oxen and cows ?
than he can. He spent an hour in walking \
with us over his grounds, and detained us t
almost imperceptibly to ourselves, till near. I

The Prospect* of the IHulticaulls Crop. 3
We do not intend, and hope we shall not |
be suspected of a design to stimulate specu- 1
lation in morus muliicaulis. Our object Is 1
to give such information as we are able to
collect from different quarters of the coun
try in relation to the growing crop of trees.
So far, our information leads us to the con- (
elusion that there will not be more than 1
one.fffth as many trees grown as there have 1
been buds planted. We have information c
of entire plantations having utterly failed;
of others that have not produced more than r
one tree for every ten buds planted; of f
others again that bid fair to yield two.thirds, '
and some few ethers that will produce one. c
half. Not more than two plantations have
been heard from by ua that have yielded <
seventy five trees for every hundred buds
planted. On carefully comparing these <
accounts we have arrived at the conclusion, 1
that iu the whole country there will be rais- f
ed not more than one.fifth as many trees as <
there have been buds plan:ed. We have
been repeatedly applied to for the cause of
this great failure. As we of course could ,
not have been present every where, we can- i
not even guess at the cause of failure in any t
particular case, some persons ntue sup. t
posed thoir failures were caused by neaping 1
the cuttings in water before planting. This '
we do not believe. Cuttings that were too ]
far gone before they were steeped would ,
certainly be hastened in their progress to \
decay by the water; but those that had life i
enough left to save them under any circum.
stances would certainly be benefitted by it.
Gardeners who propagate roses, dsc. by
cuttings, understand the value of putting
the cuttings in water a few hours before 1
planting them. Others attribute the failure '
to early planting, others to late planting;
some to deep planting and some to shallow
planting. But the great body of cultivators
attribute it to to the peculiarly unfavorable
season and bad condition of the cuttings.?
The two latter reasons we are inclined to
think are the truo ones. Wo have seen
cuttings planted that were perfectly drydry
as our walking stick, and we should as
soon have expected a crop of walking canes
to hnve grown from our old sweet gum laid
in a furrow, as we should a crop of moras
multicaulis from some cuttings we have
seen planted this spring.
We at present consider the prospect
of the prices of trees in the fall to be deci.
dedly good?even better than at this time
last year.?Jour. Am. Silk Society.
Vaccination* v
The following Report of a committee on
this subject was presented^ thfiJafp Annnnl _j
xarovcmftTij urcne Connect cut Medical Society.
The Committee to whom was referred the
subject of Vaccinationt beg leave to Report : ^
?That this important subject, at all times
deserving of the attention of medical men,
has of lata years been rendered peculiarly
so by the increase of variolous and vario*
loid diseases. .
It is now about fifty years since the vac.
cine virus was introduced 10 puWio ^noticeby
l)r. Jenner. He obtained it from a cow j
in the place where he resi ed. From this
origin-?from this one cow?more than fifty
years ago?was derived the virus since
carried over the world, and used in all coun*
tries. In 1800 some of it was brought into
this country by Dr. Waterhouse, of Cam.
bridge, Mass., and from thence has been
distributed over the United States. Your
Committee are, however, aware, that some
genuine virus was obtained in this country
directly from cows, abouf the time that it
was brought hither fiom England. Some
was thus obtained in 1801, by Dr. William
Buel, of Sheffield, Mass., and by Dr. North,
of Goshen, and Dr. Trowbridge, of Dan. J
' ' *L:- fiinoo limp Wfl be.
joury, in uiio omioi wiuww ????w -? ?
; lieve it has very rarely been obtained from 5
' cows, in this, or in other countries. !
j Fears have of late season among physic- jj
| ians in Europe, and to some extent in this *
I this country, that this virus so long circula- c
ting in the human system, has lost some of 1
its preventive power; and tr.uny behove 1
from tl.eir own observation, that it is less ac- 8
live than formerly. * 5
Efforts have been made in England to
obtain virus again from its original source; G
but it is a singular fact, that though cows *
were often a^ected with this disease about *
the time of Jenner's discovery, not only in 1
England, but in this and other countries, yet c
for many years since then, nnd even until J
w tihin a few years, it has but seldom been !
witnessed in this animal. I
This has given rise to the opinion enter, f
tamed by some, that the vaccine disease J
is really but a f rm of small pox, mitigated '
by passing through the system of another '
animal;?an opinion deserving of cons'd- {
eration and investigation.
Within the last year Mr, Estlin, a distinguished
surgeon of Bristol* England obtained
some virtu direct from the cow. This *
has been used extensively in England* and t
deemed by those who have tried it* to be
more active than that formerly in use* pro. t
ducing larger and more distinct pock and s
areola* and more marked constitutional c
symptoms. Mr. Estlin has had the kind, t
ness to transmit portions of this recent virus r
to several physicians in this country. One r
of your Committee received from him a [
small quantity in October last* which was t
but the tenth remove from the cow. This
has been used by the Physicians of Hart* <
ford, and been found to produco the pecu- t
liar symptoms of the vaccine more distinctly '
than that used by them for several years t
past. s
Your Committee arc desirous of awak. 1
enirg the attention of the members of this J
i Society to ibe whole eubjeotof vmrd' pox, *
4- s .
tnd its varieties and methods of cure and
irevention. So far as they can learn,
here is net the least ground to doubt that
he genuine vaccine virus is completely prefentivo
of the small pox ; but they are fearul
that much virus has been used that is
lot genuine, and they are not without appretension
that the preventive powers of the >
raccine virus from variolous disease, may
>e but temporary, lasting but ten or fifteen
fears. This apprehension is strengthened
>y the increase of small pox of late, and by
nvcstigations recently instituted in Europe
ipon the subject.
Your Committee/therefore, take the lib..
?rty of off* ring the following suggestions:
1. That every Physician who attends At
he birth of a child, should soe that the child
s vaccinated during its first year. This
viil serve to keep most parts of Hie State
constantly supplied with virus.
2. That the most careful examination ke
nade to ascertain from the appearance of
he pock and areola, and the symptoms maafested,
that tho virus is genuioe, and in ell
:ases of doubt to re-Vaccinate.
3. That Physicians recommend re-vac:i
nation once in ten or twelve years.
4. That they, embrace every opporUto'ty

TENNESSEE.
The Rev. Henry Ruffner, of Virginia,
vho visited Nashville in August last, gives
he following account of tho people.
" You arrive, a stranger at a public
louse ; you wish to see men and tnings,
10 you keep a good deal about the bar room
ind door. Near meal time, you observe
he company increase ; young men and
niddle aged men come in; and as the
ninutes wear away, they become restless,
rncing the room near the door that .leads
o tho dining hall, and seeming frequently
o listen, as if they watched for tokens of a
:oming person or event. If ignorant of
his custom, your curiousity is excited to
earn the cause of their movements and gesures.
Wait a little, and you will see them
simultaneously rush through the door, and
lurry into the dining room, almost before
fou hear tbe dinner bell. You and other
itrangers begin to follow. Before you have
time to enter the dining room, you hear a
thundering of chairs, succeeded instantly by
a sharp confused clatter of plates, dishes,
knives and forks. When you enter the
room, you find all the most convenient seats
at the table, occupied by a set of men, with
heads down and mouths open ; and pieces
rapidly disappearing from their plates by
the quick threo fold operation of a cut?a
gape-?and a swallow. You may take your
seat where you can, and eat as you list?
what is it to them 1 They see you not,
their eyes are-on their plates?they hear
you not, their ears are filled with the music
of the knives, forks, and glosses. By the
time you are fairly under way with your
meal, you again hear the frequent grating
of chairs on the floor as tbey rise and depart."
Respecting the people in general* he says:
** I was struck most agree; bly with the
open, benevolent countenances ofihe people
abeut the streets. Non< of you care-worn,
shy, suspicious looking faces, so frequent

I nevor saw more quiet streets and more
uniform good behaviour. A population of
this character cannot be idle, though I observed
less signs of a painful and bustling
industry, than is usual in northern towns.

An affecting incident occured at Lynn,
on Saturday. A little girl, two years of
age, a child of Mr. Ingalls, wandered away
from its pa.*ents in the afternoon, and on
the most diligent search could not be found
during the evening. On Sunday morning
the search was renewed by many people
in vain. An intelligent dog, belonging to

was wanting set off in pursuit. In a short
time he returned, and endeavored by significant
signs to induce some one to follow
him ; but human sagacity, in this instance,
qs in many before, was inferior to canine.
Again he went away, and again retunred,

SAUTIfUL COINCIDBNCB.
During the morning service on Sunday last,
it Christ Church, Salem street, an incident occurred
whicfi would have been interpreted by
the ancients as a signal of Divine approbation.
The Rev. Mr. Marcus, of Nantucket, the officiating
minister, gave out to be sung, the 84th
Psalm, in which is the following stanza:
The birds more happier far than t,
Around thy temple throng;
Securely there they build, and there
Securely hatch their young.
Whi>8t he was reading this Psalm, a Dove
flew in at one of the windows, and al gbted on
the capital of one of the pilasters, near the
altar, and nearly over the head of the reader.
A note of tho Psalm and Hymn to be sung had
been previously given, as is customary, to the
choir; otherwise, it might have been supposed
that there was design in t'<s selection, fur the
second singing, the 75th hymn, commencing,

We learn from the Post master at
Sneedsboro that oar paper did not reach that
office either last week or week before. Our

the package for that office. If so, the fault
must be some where else, not in our office.?
We notice the subject in this public way to

be.
South Carolina Temperance Advocate.
We have received the flrst number of this
paper; It is published weekly in Colombia on
a sheet nearly as large as our own, at two dollars
and fifty cents per annum, paid in advance,
or three dollars at the close of the year; edited
by the Rev. Julius J. Du Bose and published
by I. C. Morgan. The paper was set on
foot and is owned by the State Temperance
Society of South Carolina. We consider the
Committee of Publication fortunate in securing
the services of Mr. Du Bose as Editor.?
His character and talents art security that
the paper will prove a faithful and able advocate
of the. good cause to which it is devoted.
We are persuaded that, except in extending
influence of the Gospel, there is no other
way in which benevolent individuals can so
?#>oto?JTjr provMta she cause of social order
in South Carolioa as by extending the
circulation of the Temperance Advocate.
?We take the liberty of suggesting thai
Temperance Sociotiee, and where there are
no societies, private individuals take step
to procure a few copies of the paper for each
hotel and*boardmg house in every town and
village in the state.
A lot of 243 Moras Multicauiis trees was
lately sold in this town for one dollar each, to
be delivered in November. They are from
cuttings planted last spring, and now average
from three to our feet in height. They were
? - ' .
produced from ionr ireei pu?uhcu UIWVII
months ago for one dollar. The grower, still
retains these four trees, which will probably
yield three or lour hundred buds each next
winter.
Morus Multicaulis Cuttings are advertised
in the Augusta (Ga.) papers, to be delivered
in that city next winter at a cent and a
half per bud. Present prices are predicated
upon the extent of the demand for the trees
last season. What the demand may be next
winter it is impossible now to iIonise. It will,
doubtless, be much influenced by the result oi
experiments in the silk culture made in diflTerent
parts of the country during the present
summer, and to be yet published. Should
these experiments fulfil the expectations of
last year, and especially should it be conclusively
proved that the hatching of (he worms
may be retarded to any period in the season,
without materially diminishing the product ol
silk, thus enabling the culturist to raise several
successive crops, the increase of demand will
most probably far exceed any present calculation.
The Charleston Cornier states, on the su.
thority of the annual report of the President
of the Bank of Charleston, that this institution
has paid an annual dividend of 10 per cent on
the capital stock ever since it has been in
operation, and has a surplus of more than
$200,000. All southern banks have been
making <arge dividends for the last few years.
Their increased profits are, doubtless, owing
to the increased price at which they sell
checks and draughts on oortnern ciues Brace
the expiration of the U, 3. Bank charter, and
the consequent discontinuance of its branches
in the southern towns. By whom are these
profits paid ? By the consumers of articles
bought at the north, and a very large proportion
by the agricultural part of the community.
And who is to blame for this state of things 1
Not the banks. They are justifiable in avail,
ing themselves of the state of the currency in
the regular course of their business, to increase
tbeir profits. The people themeelvei
are to blame; or rather the politicians?the
office holders and office seekere?whom the
people suffer to straddle their necks and ride
them at pleasure. That the currency can be
so regulated as to reduce the loss on exchange
almost to nothing was most abundantly proved
by the experience of the twenty yean between
1816 and 1836; and that it was intended by
those who formed and adopted the constitution
to give Congress the power of regulating the
currency there seems to be no rational ground
to doubt. Whether a National Bank is a
"necessary and proper" agent for accomplishing
so valuable a purpose is a different question.
President Jackson was led to the conclusion
that it is not. He considered state
banks sufficient and the "proper" agents. He
tried them; but the experiment signally and
very speedily failed, as the wisest statesmen
anticipated would be the case. Let other
agencies be tried until the country shall learn
wisdom from experience. If any more suitable
and less dangerous than a national bank can
be found, let it be adapted and adherad to.
We see in a Columbia paper an*Advertisement
by a citizen of Virginia warning As pub*
lie against the Bank of tiamburg. Bui the impression
made on our mind by reading his own
statement of facts, is that he only failed in a
stratagem to get specie, whilst the bank Jhiriy
fulfiled its obligation in the case. He bought ft
check from the bank on tlftiCkxsi&ecciftlBMk
of Columbia, paying the usual premium. When
he presented the-theck. the Iwnk toMCofumbift
would pay it only in current bank bills, of ether
banks; ana noun iucu vwu ???? ?? w r?.
cio. He hereupon returned to Hambarg and
demanded the specie. This the Hamburg
bank refused) but offered to return him the
bills which he had given for the cheek. Then
he refused and tlireatened to bring suit, affirm,
ing that before he would be clunned out of km
right he would loose double the amount. Bat Open
"more mature reflection" be considered it was
best to recall a rash promise, for the reason
that "if the bank is not broke by such men
as them, it might shortly be so*" and he might
loose his money with the costs of suit. 80 he
took back his own notes, and now seekf re.
venge for the disappointment by abusing the
directors.
Although the Bank was legally bound to pay
specie, and could be compelled to do to by suit
at law, there was no moral obligation to do it
before judgement should be obtained^eemgthat
the attempt was clearly one to entrap it into
1 an obligation to do so. If the advertiser wished
to obtain specie fairly be could have done it
by putting himself to the trouble or expense
of procuring tbe necessary amount of the bills
issued by the Hamburg or the Columbia bank.
Either would have paid him the specie, on do*
man J, for their own bills. The rata hi pub.
lishing such an advertisement is be domi is
only "cutting off* his nose to spite his"? enemies,
or rather those to whom he ifo without

One of tbe District Attorneys of New YflSk
lately requested Governor Seward of tldt
State to make a requisition upon the Lieut.

very properly declines making tbe requisition
00 tbe ground that tbe constitution gives

" states that in case of a similar application
made to him beforo, he refered the matter to
ihartonpftl Government and the Secretary

bad passed no law on the subject, and there
was no treaty (provision in relation to it, the

applications. This case proves the importance~
