For Bowel Complaint he would also recommend t

e found to improve the quality of the cotton, by
lore perfectly cleaning it. They can be made to
>ntain from 20 to 1 GO saws in a stand, and whether ,
nail or large, one hand will be sufficient to attend ?
lem. The Gins have mechanical feeders and
ippers attached to- them, which free the cotton
run leaves, trash, dirt, &c. befqre it can teach the
,w8, and by the thorough hackling operation it
ceive8 from the feeders, which make two revo- y
tions to one of the saws, it is almost in a half

try simple arrangement of & screw to each set ot
tates, on which the hoppers r?*st, kud through F
liicli the teeth of the feeders pass, (hey can be
ade to feed slpw or fkst to suit the condition of
e cotton at the time. When made double, the F
ws are placed on two sets of cylinders and turn

iccoinpsnied by a specimen of the cotton, ginned

exhibits a decided improvement on the usual process
of ginning; delivering the staple uninjured
ind free from nap or trash, clean and of good co?
or ; thereby giving the article an additional value.
These favorable impressions of the advantages of
pour Patent 'Gin, have been confirmed by subse*
juently wilnetsing it in operation. The utility of
he double cylinders and saving of labor, will be
eadily perceived and properly appreciated by the
ntelligent planter. , .. .

and, and during four years of that time,,1 was
o rem an in the house of Messrs. Lewis, "Williams
fc Co.", and near five years spinner in. the house of
flessrs. fcandford A Gnene. I have seen your J
Cotton Gin in ?>peration, and have examined the
otton ginned by it, and pronounce it belter cleaned,
and the staple less . injured, than any cotton
hat ever came under hiy observation. It is com letely
ready for the breaker without the aid of the
lower, and would, therefore, save the first process
n manufacturing the article. 1 consider cotton
leansed by your Gin, would command from oris j
r> two cents on the pound more than the average J
rops brought into the Manchester market, and
leansed by conurtqn Gins Tours, very resp'ly. i

It is desirable, when planters give orders for Gins, J
