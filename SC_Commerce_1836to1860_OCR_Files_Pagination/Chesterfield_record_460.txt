Thin Shoes.?We ask the attention
of our lady readers to the following paragraph
from the PhialJelphia North American:
A summer bird that has lingered late
into the antumn, leaving its timid foot
print in the first fall of snow, ever reminds
us of that delicate fair one, in light
thin slippers, on a cold icy pavement.?
The bird however, can escape toa warmer
clime, and in the spring it can re-appear;
but the ladv is on that journey from which
there is no return. The music ofthe bird
may again gladden its native tree; but
her voice will not again cheer the hearth
of her home. The badges of sorrow and
the slowly returning hearse, will soon tell
what that slipper has done. It has taken
from us in the bloom of life one that we
loved, bur who would not listen to the
voice of admonition. Iler bright days
are now passed; the light of her countenance
has fled, and the night of the grave
contains the deep couch of her repose.?
But a voice speaks tenderly from that
grave to those whom she has left behind :
it whispers the admonition which she disregarded.
Shall that whisper not be
heard? It is a sister's voice that pleads.

THE EXERCISES of th.s Institute n W'll
be resumed on the second Monday in January
next uj.derthe direction of Mr. Chauncv P.
Judd as Principa in the Male, and M;ss Ann
^ Throop in the Female Department.
Mr. Judd is a graduate of Yale Ollege,
has had e?>me experience in teaching and
prcsentR with his application, a strong certificate
of c haracter and Competency, to teach
from President Day Pndesor Silliinan, and the
rest of the Faculty of Yale, as well as a number
of distinguished references; in this S'.ate.
The object of the course of instruction will
be to fit pupils for any class in collegp, for mercantile
pursuit*, and other walks ol life. The
mode of teaching will be the inductive, proceeding
from truths simple and at once admitted,
to those more difficult. Reviews wil be
frequent and rigorous. *1 he scholars improvement
will not be estimated by the space gone
over, nor merely by the number of ideas he obtains;
but by the use he can make of them.?
Greek, Latin, and t rench, will be taught; and
besid"s the customary English studies, instruction
will he given in Surveying. Bok-keeping,
and in the chief papers of commerce.
Mits Throop was Educated at the Burling
ton Female Seminary in Vermont where her
course was sufficiently thorough to induce
Miss Green the accomplished Principal oft hat
Institution to certify in almost unqualified
terms to her competency for teaching in the
inost respectable Female Schools; Miss
Throop presents moreover wi'h her application
high tcs iiHomals, from sources of distinction
in this state, where she hus taught during
the present year.
The Trustees ha' ing thus selected Teachers
to their entire sat inaction for both Departments
the ensuing year, qualified in their
opinion to imprtrt a thorough, at d accomplifhed
education?they appeal confidently to the
suirounding country n< w to come up liberally
to the support ol this excellent Institution.
To lbi?e who from the absence of such
facilties in educat tig their children, have to
seek them abroad, this place it would seem
should recommend itself above almost any other.
The Village in which the Scho-,.1 is located i.considered
beautiful, and is undoubtedly
healthy it is a so remarkably quiet, moral and
even K-l.gioiis having none cd those tempt a
ions to dangerous to fender age vt Inch usu
Hy infect Villages?such as dissipation, Vice
and immorality of every dipenpti- n.
Board may be obtained low in Public or
private houses, arid the rates of tuition aie
clieap accord ng to the grades.
The first Session will commence the second
Monday in January and end the second week
in June?the second Session the second Monday
in July and end the second week iu D< comber?an

be sold at public sale on monday
V w the lltn of January next, at Darlington
Court House a valuable plantation on Pee
Dee River in the Welch Neck, on the Vlailboro,
side of the river, and immediately opposite
the public landing at Society Hill. There
are a thousand acres in the tract and four
hundred cleared fronting on the river and
prelected by a bank extending five or six
miles above and below; which renders it as se
cure from freshets a9 any banked land on the
river. To the p'acc is attached a scein bar
at which there have been perhaps as many
shad caught as at any other.
A large proportion of the land is fertile and
wed adapted to corn and cotton, and no place
in the Welch Neck has greater advantages
of Timber and range. The situation for negro
houses has proved as healthy as any on
the river, and it wou d be very convenient to
a r?6idence, either at, or near Society Hill.
The lands are known as the W'dds and Domahoy
land, and belonged to the late Mr
John Rogers of Marlboro District, Hettcr terms
may probably :e had in the purchase of them
at this time than can be got elsewhere on the
river; the conditions will be l.beral and made
known on the day ??f sale.
