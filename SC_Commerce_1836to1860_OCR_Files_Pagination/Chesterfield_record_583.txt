Air. Vickers, a reformed drunkard, of
Baltimore, in the course of a recent
speech, related tho incident which we sub.
join. We wish it could he read by every
hard drinker in the qonntry, for it appears
to us to convey an admonition
which even the must insensible must
feel. .
You cannot think, Raid Mr Vickers.
how soon a man's circumstances become
changed when once he has signed th<pledge.
I will tell you of a man whom I
knew in Baltimore. He was not worth
a cent a day, and his family was sup.
ported by his hard working wife. Ji had
heard of the Washington Society,
and he had determined to join. But how
should he get his quurter of n dollar, which
was required for the initiation fee ? H.went
to his wife, and told her he wanted
a quarter of a dollar. ''What for?" said
he, "No matter," said ho, " I want it
and must have itshe gave it to him.
knowing it would he of no use to withhold
it, and supposing he meant to huv
rum with it. Ho went to the Washington
Society on a Monday night nnd joined.
The next dnv he went to work at his
trade, which was a good one, and ha could
make money fast. He came ho jw- * r

the flour c.? rminly could not he for her. j
While they wero talking? the hu?lmnd j

land on the 4th of July, 1839{ The principles
settled by the charge to the jury
are of some importance to travellers,
common carriers, and transporters of
passengers.
1. That it was nojustificption to prove
that the boat was constructed as boats
usually are, unless it was proved she was
safe and secure. Owners of public vehicles
nr? required by law. to (lake great
care, and use all necessary precaution ;
and defendants were wrong in supposing
that less care was required in regard to
persons than goods ; for gooda they are
Ky law accountable, unless they can show
| that the loss arose from the act sf God or
tho King's enemies. This is the common
law, and the principles was equally applicable
here. Having charge of human
life, less cannot be required of the owners
of public: vehicles.
2 That the proprietors of public conveyances
were bound to act impartially,
with respect to persons applying for passage,
though they could not legally take
one and refuse another, capriciously ;
yet they were bound to take no more than
can he taken with safety; and of this the
proprietors, or their agents, are to be the
judges.
3. Passengers crowding into the boat,
and rushing upon the promenade neck in
unusunl numbers, was not admitted to be
an excuse for the accident. The proprietors,
or agents, were bound to caution the

Texas.?Renewed Invasion.?We

foray, committed in Refugio county, on :

party consisted of about fifty Mexicans;
the name of their commander was not

upon the town, and took possession
of it, helping themselves to every thing
they could lay their hands on, and carrying
off eight prisoners, among whom were
the district clerk, the late sheriff, and a

TRIAL OP EDWARD BOLINQ.
Edward Boling, the storv of whose
villany has for some time filled the surrounding
country, was tried last Friday
on an indictment for Bigamy, at the Su
perior Court of Rockingham county,
before his honor Judge Nash. The rare
occurrence of the crime with which lie
whs charged, 'the respectability*of the
parties suffering from it, and the novel
character of the circumstances attending
the commission of the offence, conspired
to draw together an unusually large
crowd of npeetators. But the trial, in
detail, turned out to he comparatively uninteresting.
A very fmall portion of the
train of minute hut strange particulars,
marking the steps of the criminal towards
the accomplishment of his crime, was
elicited on the examination of evidence.
For the conviction of the prisoner it was
only necessary to prove his identity, and |
that he had a wife living before and at
the time of his second marriage ; consequently
the principal developements of
the trial consisted in the proof of these
barren fuels. The case submitted to the j
jury upon the charge of the Judge, and
a verdict of "Guilty" returned after an
absence of a very few minutes.
As time will not now permit us to attempt
a circumstantial narration of tho
facts, as we heard them from the jtrial.
j and from other sources.
Edward Holing, the son of a worthy I
Methodist minister of Caswell county,
was married to Miss Harriet Parks, of
the same county, in July, 1888. He was
19 years i f age in May preceding his
marriage; h's wife between 16 and 17.
About the last of September or first of
October, 1840 a young man of genteel
appearance and pretty good address arrived
in Greensboro', gavo his name as
Sidney T. Smith, and said he was from
Perry county,, Alabama. He went immediately
to the office of one of our lawyers
and delivered a letter which purported to
he from Jtf.mes Smith, of Ala., the writer
stating that ho wished his son Sidney,
the hearer, to prosecute the study of the
law to a certain extent, so that he might
be enabled the better to manage a large
property that: would eventually fall to
him. The letcer contained some other
fatherly suggestions relative to the gui- j
dance of son Sidney, just as one would
suppose an easy old planter to write.
Young Mr. Smiih secured hoarding in
a respectable family ; paid about as much
attention fo Coke and Blackstnne ns is
generally looked for in a rich young hairbrained
siudert; and commenced "cutting
tho gent" in prosperous fashion. In
the most natural way in the world he
mentioned, upon suitable occasions, the
vast possessions of the venerated Mr.
James Smith, of Perry county, Ala. and
passed among his new aequnintances
| withal! the ease of "heir presiwnptivc" to
an Alabama fortune.
In December he left the place on a j
pretended visit to certain wealthy rein- j
tions in Nottoway, Virginia, and did not)
return until February, 1841. In th"
mean time a letter was rrcerved by one
of his creditors from a pretended uncle
of young Mr.. Smith, slating that his
return was prevented by the illness of his
servant.
After his return from this jaunt, some I
time in the month of March, he received
the bs'ou iding and grievous intelligence
of the dynth of his father in the southwest.
He ^.xiibited a letter containing!
this information with marks of most sincere
grief; tied crape around his hat;
mourned as a dutiful son for the sad event
that had thus early in life burdened him
with the care of a fortune;?ntid forthwith
began to "surge his credit" in the
stores, tailor shops, &,c. (
In the mean time he had formed an
acquaintance with the family of Mr.
Brannock, of Guilford county, nnd an
intimacy with his daughter, which, on her
part, ripened into affection, and ho asked
her hand in marriage. Mr. 13. prudently
inquired into the character and circum.
stahces of his proposed son-in-law; the
investigation turned out satisfactory; and
the marriage was consummated in May,
1841.?Mr. Smith being anxious to have
it over, aud go with his lady out to his
bereaved mother.
During the summer he concluded to
settloin Caswell, N. CM having the offer
of a valuable tract of land from E \ward
Boling, and induced Mr. Brannock to as- ,
sist him with his namo in procuring a loan
of money, until he could realize some of
his Alabama fortune. The land trade
continued to ho canvassed until Mr. B.
began to suspect that all was not right,
asked an explanation of Smith, who confessed
that Boling, had managed to swindle
him out of a large part of his money,
without giving him a title to the land?
Mr. B. fi nally had Boling arrested at Caswell
courthouse, and ascertained to his
astonishment and dismay tbat he was the
same ma a who had married his daughter
under the name of Sidney T. Smith.
The v llain continued up to the time of
his arrest to pass in Caswell as Edward,
Baling, and in Guilford ns Sidney T.
Smith. His last wife, the daughter of
Mr. B.,at one time becoming uneasy at (
the protracted absence of Mr. Smith,
went to the house of the elder Mr. Boling, j
expecting to find there her husband in J
compan) with young Mr. tJoling, ot wn?m f
he was purchasing land. But young ,
Mr. Boling, c?n seeing her carriage, wns
taken sulderiy, t//, could see no one, and
passed the night in a room with his true .
wife,?no one hut himself suspecting the
strange connexion existing among the ,
company then under his father's roof.
Such are the prominent occurrences of
this strange affair. Wo have no space
for more at this time ; hut if not done bv
a more co mpctent hand, we shall attempt
a full and circumstantial detail, when we
can procure the numerous letters bv
which tho infamous deception wig kept

RHODE ISLAND.
Another convention to firm a new
constitution for the State of Rhode Island
is now in Session at Providence. The 1
Journal says it is the third which has
convened for the same purpose within a |
few years. We believe the one now in i
session was regularly and legally called, I
which whs not the case with the "Suffrage
Convention" which adjourned not |
long sinc.3.
The present constitution of Rhode Island
is the charter originally granted by <
Charles II. The little State has prospered
well under it ; but the democratic
, C ? A .* r? /lo n eknn
I r iiijuili.: y ?#i uii; n^n iichkiii'is ? vn??^v
in its provisions?particularly with regard
to tne extension of the right of suffrage,
which at present, we believe, 13
confined to freeholders. J1
W e may note that in every State which !
hat introduced changes in ifs constitution j 1
since the Revolution, such changes have i j
tended to the further diffusion of the dern- 11
oeratic principle. We use this phrare 11
without regard to party distinctions; for )(
it predominate# in ah parties to such a ,
d> gree us to constitute tho characteristic
spirit of the times. Soma of these constitutional
changes have been in reference
l<> the universal diffusion of the right of
suffrage, abolishing all qualifications of
property; others altering the tenure of
judicial service, and introducing a term
of years instead of the old rule of good I
behaviour; others have brought the elections
of the Executive and other officers
directly before the People, and, in some
cases, we believe, judges have become
subject to the popular choice.
It will he well if this tendency stops
with the reformation of real abuses. Our
constitutions of Government, both State
a ad National, are in their true nature 1
republican; they include the rcpresenta- I
(ive principle, and unite with it the idea , {
of a pm/riHUcnt sovereignty ; they are t
adapted (ogive expression to the popular ^
will as it may change from time to time, j
and also to concentrate and to hold stead- ^
fast the solemn, sober, and profound sentiments
of the People,a* uttered rnlmlv, 1
in deep reflection, and under a sense of *
the weighty responsibility of self-govern- 1
menf. Possessing all authority, the Peo- t
pie established constitutions and ordained r
laws to restrain and regulate themselves t
in the administration thereof, knowing ?
that the laws of right and justice are
above them, to understand and obey which
the human will and reason need humility 1
and self-distrust. 1
A constitutional republic is a limited 1
government?limited by the People them- t
selves who divest themselves of the power c
of abusing power, as far as their most cir- t
cumspect wisdom may enable them to do <
90. The authority thus constituted is
above both rulers and people, because it
is founded, or so intended, on principles
of right and justice to which the human
conscience a.id understanding acknow- c
ledge themselves subject. To change it 1
ih any way is lawful only when it becomes
rIetirly apparent that some of its provis- g

Major General Winfield Scott has pub. i
lished a long letter, in reply to many let- c
ttrs he had received, arowing his opinions i
on mod of the agitating questions of the t
day, and concluding as follows: j
* Finally, I am asked, if nominated as
a candidate for the Presidency, would you
accept the nomination? I beg leave respectfully
to reply, Yes; provided that I
he not required to renounce any principle
professed above. My principles are
convictions." i
The General declares that, although j
bred to arms, from early manhood, he has <
always taken an interest in political af- I
fairs; that he was opposed to the alien ]
? f'ii ' , UMU?g
and sedition laws, an advocate of thiwtf
of] 812 against Great Britain, and a ?np*
porter of the Administration of JimnP
and Madison. He avows a deep rover*
ence for the judiciary, state end federal,
as an independent department of the gov*
crnment; and holds the decision of the
Supreme final and conclusive, oil ill
doubtful questions, arising under the con*
stitution or laws of the Union, unless rec*
versed on a rehearing before the same
tribunal. Ho favors a limitation of tho
executive veto and of executive patron,

to any pledge against a second term, be.

tendered to other aspirants?yteld to

denying re-eligibility to the Presidency,
and extending the term to six
years. As to the leading measures of the
late extra session of Congress, he sew?

We~give place, below, to a communi. fc
cation nominating Mr. Wakdlaw for the
Presidency of this institution, and copy,
from the South Cnrolinian, a communi.
cation to that paper, nominating Chan,
ceilor Job Johnson for the same office.
We ?till hope the health of President
Barnwell may be so far restored as to
enable him to discharge the duties of this
important office, and that lie may bo
prevailed upon to accede to the very gone,
ral and ardent wish of the whole State,
by again accepting the appointment from
the trustees. Should this, however, not
be the case, an election of some other
person will probably be made during the
approaching session of the Legislature.
The great popularity and prosperity of
the college for several years past are lobe
ascribed mainly to the decidedly religious
character of President Barnwell and Pro.
feasor Elliot. We are very far from
meaning any disparagement to the other
respectable professors who were associated
with them, or to the other qualifications
for which they wero themselves distinguished
Neither do we: mean that re.
ligious character alone would satisfy the
public. What we do mean is that other
qualifications, however, eminent, wouid
not satisfy the public, as past experience
most abundantly proves. If the trustees
wish the prosperity and usefulnessof the
College to continue, fhev must continue
at its head a m in distinguished as Well
for piety as for talents and literature.
If past experience proves any thing it
proves this.

Ma Editor. I have witnessed with much ^
pleasure the deep interest which seems to
n.rviHo thp nrpsa in our late in relation to
the future direction and proapec't of our college.
The institution, under the auspices of
wise legislation has assumed an enviable
standing among her sister college*! and pub"
ic money cannot be laid cut more advantageously,
nor produce a nchcr harveat in any
;iher field, than this. It is deeply, to be re-jretted
that President Barnwell could not
lave been retained io the position which lit
iiled with so much ability and success. The
>ublic confidence will not however ba impaw;<l
if a proper person is selected to fill this
racancy. The time is approaching when
he Board of Trustees wil be called upon to
nake this selection. Hitherto hopes have
ieen entertained, that Mr. Barnwell would bo
nabled, upon the restoration of his health, to
esume his place. These hopes are fallacious,
md all eyes are busy in the look out for a
luilable successor; as such I have determined
ipon the Hen. L. D. Wa-dlaw. I know not
vhat are the prospects of obtainiog the sero.
es of this distinguished individual The
nation is one of high responsibility and conse[uently
of high honor?none more ao. It hae
incurred to me, that nc one in our State
mswere the cols of the institution eo wo!L
ie is a South Carolinian ; graduate of the
loliece well known; a gentleman of .fine
w ?
iterary taste and fond of literary pursuits.
The high character of this individual would
five him at once the con6dence of Parent*
ind Guardians, whilst his present distinction
vould be the guarantee of his futurs success,
lis fine address, polite manners, and firm
control would secure to him tho respect and
?teem of those under his government. His
nor at character is of that unexceptionable
;*st which would meet general approbation;
ind in fine he seems to have every qualifiesion
which is suitable for President of th*
3juth Carolina College.
