SEIZURE OF AMERICAN FISHERMEN. ]
We staied a few days s?nce, says the New I
York Courier and Enquirer, that the Secreta- I
ry or the Treasury had despatched the United |
States revenue cutter Hamilton, captain Sturgis,
from Boston, on a cruize to Yarmouth V
and its vicinity, to inquire into the circumstan- ,J
ces under which many of our fishing vessels
had been seized during the present season by c
the British authorities in Nova Scotia. Cap . r
Sturgis, accompanied by Mr Barnes, the Na- f
val officer of Boston, immediately proceeded to e
Yarmouth in the Hamilton, and thence uo the
Bay of Funday, to Brier Island and near Digby. (j
The Hamilton also crossed over to Mo .nt
Dessert in Mane, where she landed two
American fishermen taken on board at Yar- 0
mouth. Captain Sturgis was absent but nine I
days on the cruize, having sai.ed ei ht hundred q
miles and ncountered much heavy weather, s
We find in the Boston Morning Post, a letter
from Henry A. Grantham, Esq, Consular
agent of the United States for the port ot Yarmouth,
addressed to captain Sturgis, and givmg
the facts in relation to four of the seizures .
It is stated by the Post to be the general opin- ( 1
ion at Yarmouth that many of the seizures had
been made without sufficient cause, and that
the greater number of them would be released c
by the Court of Vice Admiralty of Halifax. ?

the maine question.
The conjecture, that the visit of Mr. Sec. *
retary Forsyth to the State of Maine had a
some connexion with the controversy he- 6(
t ween the United States and Great Britain b
concerning the Northeastern boundary ft
question, is confirmed by the subjoined ex- w
tract from a leading Whig journal in Maine. 81
From tho fact of the Secretary having con- a
suited not only the Governor of the Sta'e,
but other prominent individuals, and of both
political parties, we draw two inferences, t]
both of which are, as far as they go, grati- 8
lying to us as Nat onal politicians, viz. w
Firs',?That the conferences between!^
tho Secretary of Stato and the Governor j 6
of M line have not been in thoir offi- 11
cial capacities, and that tho Executive 11
has therefore not recognized the right of
any State in this Union to prescribe the
terms of negotiation between the Uniied
Stales and any foreign Power : and, sec- r
ondiy, that there is an earnest and sincere v
desire on the part of the Executive to bring
this unhappy controversy with Great Britain J
to a prompt and amicable close, on such a
terms as shall be acceptable to the Public c
of Maine, without distinction of party.?

FROM TH.E KENNEBEC (MAINE) JOURNAL.
The Joint Commission.?In the Kenne
bee Journal of May *21sl we published the f,
letter of Mr. Stevenson, our M nister in a
London, with an extract from * commuui. ti
cation of Lord Pulmerston of April 3, pro- 1'
posing a joint commission to survey and 1
settle the Northeastern boundary line, from
which we learnt that the British Goverment
had subnr itted to ours a 44 draft of a convention
for the purpose of regulating the proceedings
ofthe commissioners." Until re- v
cently wc have been in ignorance of the g
nature of this 44 draft," but arc now compelled
to say that our worst apprehensions
are fully realized. We are not able to inform
our readers by authority of the precise
terms of this *4 draft," but can say that they (
are wholly inadmissible. i
Mr. Forsyth, the U. S. Secretary ofState, f
has been here, where the Governor an 1 tl
| Council arc in session. While in Portland a
Fist week he had a conference with Gw. is
^airfield, Mr. Williams, Gov. Kent, Col. t*
) ivies, and others, who met him there on lis
invitation, and submitted to them the
>roposition of the Bri:ish Government.
They were unanimous in the opinion that
dame could not agree to it, and they regar[
d it only as calculated, ifnot designed to 1
nake a furtherund severer test of the patient V
orbcarance of the State, by delaying any fi
quitable settlement. p
What actton the Governor a d Council p
nay take on the subject we do not know. 1
mt understand that tue G ivernor and the s
ither gentlemen who were consulted at tl
'orlland complied with Mr. Forsyth's re. t
[uest by making a counter proposition, n

MR. JOUDON. 0
The London correspondent of the New o
fork Courier and Enquirer holds the following e
anguage with refereuce to Mr Jaudon and c
lis agency : J
"It may be im^rtant to explain the true ^
ircumstances ot the closing of the London
gency ot the United States Bank, in reply to
much distorted and entirely unfounded state- r
nent which appearei in the city art'Cle oitne n
London Times, of Monday Ia6t, and which will tl
robably be seized upon with avidity for ex- h
ract and comment, by the American editors ^
/ho are hostile to the interests of'lie Bank. ,
In the Times it is represented' ?hat Mr. Jauon
is about to wind up his agency and leave P
England, in consequence of tho want of Me- ?
ess which has attended his mission in this

he riost unquestionable authority, that Mr.
audon is certainly about to make preparaions
for winding up his affairs and returning q
o the United States, in the course of some six
lonths from the present time; but the discon- 8
inuance of the special agency in England has P
io connection whatsoever, with such circum- c
tance as are s ? falsely set forward by the tl
Time*, for the mission of this gentleman was tl
tever intended to be permanent, but arose only h
>ut of the extraordinary slate of the money a

low the business being brought into 6atisfac.
ory train, it is intended that the permanent .
gency of the Bank of the United States is to ti
e urn mro the hands of the eminent house of n
Jarmg, Brothers & Co. These are tho plain b
ircumstances of ihecase in answer to the ina- y
ignant assertions of the Tunes, against a

We are informed that a child aged about
0 years, the daughter of Mr. Abraham
Velch, who resides about ten miles in the
jrest, North of Lake Pleasant, was torn in
lieces, and almost entirely devoured, by a
anther ofthe largest size,on Monday week.
?he child was playing on the bank of a
mall stream, within sight and hearing of
he house, when the panther sprang from a
hicket of hemlock, and seized her by the
icck, and after dragging her into the thickt,
proceeded to devour her at leisure. The
aether of the little girl had gone to a spring
. few rods helow the house, for the purpose
f obiaining a pail of water, and she returnu
just in time to see the monster leap the
reek with the last remaining limb of her
iaughior hanging from his mouth. Mrs.
Velch comprehended at a glance the exeqt
of the calamity, and she immediately
an for her husband, who was engaged in
lakiog shingles, nearly a mile and a half in
10 woods from the house. He immcdia'cstoried

its usefulness will be extremely limited.
To this end, the services of several scientific
