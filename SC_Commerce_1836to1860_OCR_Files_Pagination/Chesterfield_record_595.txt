Your committee cannot conclude these

adding, that with every care and attention,

the adoption of every improvement, and
Using the utmost economy in every arrangement,
there is no planter in our section,
if there be any in the State, who
can make the legal interest of 7 per cent, j

very few of thern, on our best lands, who
can realize this much, at 10 cents per lb.
nctt, and not many who can do it at 12 j
cents. If prices do not improve, most of
ua will be compelled to abandon cotton.
If they fall lower, it will be difficult to say
who ran plant, in this section, at least. ;
A very few years more, will decide our ,
fate. It will he the part of wisdom to go j
on, and endeavor to perfect the art of!
planting, that we may be able, if it is j
possible, to compete with richer soils, and
more congenial climes; but it would be
folly, if we did not, at the same time,
look ar< und us, to see what our country
it capable of yielding, and encourage
liberally, every effort, to develope our re.

Columbia, Dec. 1.
The monotony of ordinary business
tontine was agreeably interrupted yesterday,
(Tuesday) by a discussion on Col.
| Hunt's bell to extend the Jail Bounds to
i ihe limits of the Judicial District. This
bill is in essence the same with the one
introduced by Mr. Porter last session but
which did not pass. Col. Hunt made a
few renoarks on the policy and propriety
of the proposed change. Mr. Rhett sus.
tained Col. Hunt's views. Mr. Dudley,
from 3farlboro', in a speech of some
length, opposed the bill. He conceived
that a creditor had rights as well as a
debtor, and that frequently the only means
to compel payment was incarceration.
Mr. W D Porter made his maiden
speech in reply to Mr. Dudley* and advocated
the policy, the justice, humanity
and expediency of the hill. Mr. B F
Perry, of Greenville, followed on the op.
! positeside and repeated the arguments of
I Mr. Dudley with an interspersion of anec.
[ dotes more or less to the point, and a
I degree of ridicule as to the eminent hard,
ship of a few days imprisonment. In
i reply to his remarks and in vindication of
j his hill, Col. Hunt took the floor and or*.,
copied the House for some time with a
speech of great abillitv and force The
question was called lor immediately upon
the conclusion of Col Hunt's remarks,
' and carried in the affirmative. So the
' hill was ordered to the Senate for coucu;n'nr?%
Dec. 1. Mr. R oper, from the commiti
tec on Agriculture. made a report on the
petition of the State Agricultural Socie|
ty.
i Mr. Dudlevgave notice, that to-morrow
It* * ' *
i he will risk leave to introduce a bid to
change the time of holding Courts in tne
! third Equity Circuit, and to make alteraJ
tious in the sameA
Bill relative to an Act of Congress,
passed on the 4 h day of September,
eighteen hundred and forty one. entitled
j " An Act to appropriate the. proceeds of
the Sales of the Public Lands, and to
grant Pre-emption rights."
Whereas, in the aforesaid Art, Con.
gross have undertaken, after providing
for certain claims and expenses, to divide
the proceeds of the sales of the public
Innds among the twenty-six States of the
Uninn, and the District of Columbia, and
j the Territories of VVisonsin, Iowa, and
; Florida, according to their respective fedj
oral representative population, as nscerI
tainod by the last census, to he applied by
the Legislature of the said States, tosuch
purposes as the said Legislatures may
direct.
And, whereas, there is no warrant for
this proceeding in the Constitution of the
U. States, and from the history of the Government
could not have been one of the
purposes for which it was formed: And
wheras, if the Federal GovcrnmMt has
the right to subsidise ail theS'?t?s. it has
the right to subsidise one or more; and if
the Stntes can he induced to take subsidies
from the Federal Government, they
may be taught to take them from other
Governments.
And, whereas, the Federal Government
cannot justify this proceeding, from the
excess in their Treasury, as they coteuipornneouslv
increased the taxes, and passed
an Act for borrowing twelve millions
of dollars: And whereas, it is best to confine
the Federal Government within the
limits prescribed in the Constitution, and
to leave the States to manage their own
affairs in their own way.
Bey it therefore enacted. By the Senate
and House of Representatives, now met
I and sitting in General Assembly, and by
I the authority of the same, That no person
! shall be appointed to receive any part of
j the said subsidy, for this State.

Here's n good idea on the subject of
advertising: "If a dealer has an article
of which tuy wishes to entire a quick return
and consequently is willing to sell at a
small profit, he is suro to advertise it;
but if he means to make a large profit
out of his customers, he is generally sly
about it. Men and women who have
their eye-teeth cut, wiil never deal at a
store where they do not advertise." Remember
that when you come to town,

WEDNESDAY, December 9,1841.
The Committe on agriculture reported
to the Senate on the 1st, inst, againist a
geological survey of the Stnte; But in
favor of an Agricultural survey. Mr.
Verdicr, a foreigner from one of the little
Parishes among the low country swamps,
| moved to postpone the report till January; '
I which motion failed by a majority of on- '
ly one; the vote standing 19 to 20. The *
question was then taken on agreeing to 1
the report, and lost by a vote of 10 to 21. 1
Had the report been ill favor a telescopic J

The prominent "delators and actors in the. '
Tialter were Union men. Dotbay utter*
!y repudiate ail degrees of state sovereign^!
:v, and have they convinced the Senate,
:hat a State, like a petty corporation or
l private criminal, is subject to arrangement
before judicial tribunals for infractions
of statutory enactments ?
The framer of the bill seems to hare
made the very notable discovery, that "if
the Federal Government has the right to
jubsidiseo// the States, it has the right to
subsidise one or morethat is, the
whole includes the several parts.
We cannot but feel somewhat surprised
it the very serious apprehension entertained
by Honorable Senators that the
'highminded chivalrous little State of
South Carolina" is in market, ready to
ae subsidised by bribes from the "Federal
urovernment" or any "other Governments?"
Do Senators feel themselves,
ind believe their constituents to be tub*
ridiseablel Or is their jealousy only for
he purity of other States? v
Three Senators voted against the bill on
ts passage, viz: Messrs. Gnuse, HagoocT
ind Verdier. Mr. Murdock, who was
ibsent, afterwards asked and obtained
eave to record his vote against it.
Mississippi bonds.?Unusual interest
is fell in the result of the late state elec[ion
in Mississippi, because one of the
questions on which the election turned'
was?f whether the state would pay
r>r repudiate her own bonds. And the
party opp?sed to paying them Hhs suc reeded
l>y a majority of several A
! hoi wand votes. This most disgraceful*
uid dishonest refusnl of a single state,,
by her popular vote, to pay her just debts
lias very materially a fleeted the credit of
[he states, and will inflict ft sever?
Wow upon the character of the country ,
abroad. Many holders of other stale
'tuck* are alarmed, and anxi'/tta tn sell,
while dealers in stocks are afraid! of
fhem. The consequence is a deprecia^
ion in their value. To what extent
State Stocks generally will nltimntely be
ifleeted bv the occurrence Ls yet nncerlain.
State debts are mere debtaof bun>r.
They cannot l>e recovered by suit
it law, like debts against individuals and
corporations. If states chonee to refuMr
payment, there is no compulsory process
hy which it can he enforced,. .Every
<tato in the Union has hitherto scrupulously
and honorably fulfilled .t*; pecuniary
ergftgernen s. Mississippi is the first
to fail. Wuicli will be the first to follow
[he base example, or whether any will
follow it, remains to he seen. .
Like most swindlers, the anti-1>ond avers
in Mississippi set up pretexts in
justification of their dishonesty. They
illege frauds in the execution and sale of
the bonds; which, they say, justify ,
lusal to pay them. The facts, so far as wt
have l?eeii able to collect them from the
liflfererw publications on the subject which
have fallen under our notice, are at follows.
The Legislature of Mississippi passed'
in act in 1837 incorporating the Union
Bank of Mississippi. This not authorized*
iMnd* of the stale to bo issued to the ^
imount of ten million* of d"llnr% payable *
in current money of the United States,
it snch place as might be named in the
indorsement on the bonds severally ?
The bonds were to be delivered to the
Bank, and the Bank was empowered to
<pll thein at par, and at an interest not
exceeding five per cent per annum, pay.
ible half yearly. The money to!?e realised
from the bonds was to be paid into
the Bank, for the purpose, we suppose, of
constituting its capital, though that fact
is not mentioned in the statements before
is. Nor is it material, inasmuch as it i*
staled that according to the act of the Le
gislalure the money was to he pnid into I
the Bank. The bonds weie-duly executed I
ind passed over to tlie Bank by tbo Gov- I
crnor of the State, for the purpose of be*
ing sold. The amount of $5,000,000 of
the bonds was sold by the Bank, in August
1638, to Nicholas Biiidle, then
President of the U. S. Bank of Pennsylvania;
the bonds and interest made payable
at the agency of said Bank in London,
in Sterling money of Great Britain, at the
rate of four shilling* and six pence to the
Jollnr; the purchase money payable in five
jqual instalments, the last in less th?n a
fear after the date of sale. The money
a as all paid into the Union Bank of Mississippi,
according to contract, and as
equtred by the law authorising the.sale
if the bonds. The bonds are now held
n Europe, and are guaranteed by the
Union Bank of Mississippi t.nd the U. S.
Bunk of Pa. But both the so securities
law fa led, and the State, who is the
irmcipd, refuses to pay; so that the
udders of the bonds are likely to lose tho
vhole amount.
Since the late election in Mississippi,
Governor McNult of that S:ate, the leader
if the "anfi-bomi" party has published a
itaiement in the Richmond Enquirer,

iftting forth the grounds on wnicn ne ana

more or less than borrowing money.
