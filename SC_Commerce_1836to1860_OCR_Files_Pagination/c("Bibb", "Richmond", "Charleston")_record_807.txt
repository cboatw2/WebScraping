DEATH BY A LONG SERMON.
And as Paul was long preaching, he sunk $ou>n
with sleep, and fell down from the third loft and was
taken up dead. Acts xx. 9. Our subject is a most
grave and serious one. We are taught in the text
that long sermons sometimes occasion death; and
there are many of them preached. The example
in the text is perhaps the only one found in the
scriptures for long sermons, and it was disastrous
enough, costing one of St. Paul’s hearers his life.
The object of preaching is to stop evil and correct
error, and this is our object in remarking upon this
subject. We shall pursue it according to'the order
of its effects, noticing the manner in which it pro
duced death, keeping in mind the principle in phil
osophy that the same cause produces the same
effects. And 1. It produced sleep. 2. The fall,
and, 3. The death of the young man. Long ser
mons in producing death, do not commonly lead to
this catastrophe at a stroke, but like opium, first
producing dullness and sleep and then the ultimate
and more fatal effects. 1. They produce sleep. This
was literally true in the case of the young man in
the text; and we have seen this effect often pro
duced by long sermons. It is true physically ; the
natural man is often put to sleep by long sermons.
It is true mentally ; the intellectual man is often
put to sleep by long sermons; people get to a point
where they can neither think nor reason. It is true
morally : long sermons put men beyond feeling.
The young man at Troas could not have felt under
a sermon that put him to sleep from its great
length, either conviction for sin, or comfort from
grace. His power of attention was exhausted ; a
state of mental torpor ensued ; and the spirit lost
all consciousness for a season. The same effects
still follow this canse. This is one of the premo
nitions of death. 2. He fell from the third loft and
was taken up dead. His fall was a literal fact, and
we have seen a few instances in which per
sons have been so effectually preached to sleep,
that they have fallen from their seats. But fortu
nately for them not from a third loft, or death would
have been the result. It was a fall from self pre
servation ; he had by being preached to sleep, lost
concern for taking care of soul or body. It was
a fall from self respect; he was put under the
shame of having gone to sleep in a public congre
gation. 3. “ He was taken up dead.” Upon this
part of the subject will be laid the burden of our
remarks. It were but a small matter for the man
to have gone to sleep or to have fallen down, com
pared with his death; and to the killing effects of
long sermons we will call the reader’s attention,
and will notice the work of death on the preacher
himself. Such sermons kill his popularity, upon
which depends much of his success and usefulness.
Public opinion is against long sermons, and who
ever preaches them must suffer in his popularity.
Many will not attend his ministry when they can
avoid it, whatever may be the ability of the
preacher. A long sermon in print will secure its
rejection by the reading community : such things
are reprobated by saints and sinners: there is a uni
versal war declared against them. We have
known people at camp-meetings to stay away
from the stand when one of your prosy long-wind
ed, never-ending preachers was expected to hold
forth. We have heard them ask with profound in
terest about a strange minister—“ does he preach j
long sermons 1” making up an opinion about !
him pro or con, just as the case might be. j
We were once surprised in our travels, falling !
into a place, and among a people, who were ex
pecting shortly a new preacher. Several were
spoken of: but the general opinion was, that a
man who was one of great ability and standing
in that country would be the man. The matter of
surprise to us was, that there was a universal ob
jection to him among the people, because of the
great length of his sermons. Some said they
would quit the congregation, for he never would
quit preaching till the dinner hells rang; others,
that they could not go but once in the day, for they
had to sit two hours, which was plenty of time for
three sermons. Death is in long sermons, and
they never fail to kill somewhere. They are death
to popularity. We have known some men who
have preached themselves out of character by
preaching long, and, of course, out of congregation;
and hardly ever preached at all, unless when they
could slip about, and get some other man’s congre
gation, greatly to the mortification of it. As we
are against long sermons, verily believing them to
be destructive of life, we must close, and continue
the subject in future, still noticing their mortal influ
ence. Prudence.
For the Southern Christian Advocate.
A MTLLERITE OF THE NEW SCHOOL, i
Mr. Editor,—Our city lias been recently visited
by a stranger professing to be a minister of Christ,
commissioned to preach the immediate end of the
world. His testimony is, that the end of all things
is at the door, and that all the affairs of this mighty
world are to be wound up between this and next
April. He differs from the old school of Millerites,
in that he does not depend on counting numbers
and ciphering out figures, or on historical events
for the fulfilment of Scripture for his conclusion,
but affirms that it was a direct revelation from God,
attested by the Holy Ghost, in which he was com
missioned to preach the end of all things ; under
which authority, he came to warn the people of
Columbus. His appointment waB published in the
city papers for Wednesday evening at the Lyceum
Hall. There were but few who attended except a
herd of wicked young men and boys,who made a kind
of fourth of July frolic of it. At the end of his
sentences, they would stamp and cheer, making
the room ring with applause, as if a war speech was
delivering, till they cheered and stamped the mis
sionary down. He made another effort next eve
ning at another place, and the result was the same
or worse. So you see that fanaticism brings the
sacredness of religion itself into ridicule and con
tempt. The man has mistaken his country; he had
belter go North; he may do something there.
Columbus, December SO. 1843. ■ P.
GENERAL INTELLIGENCE.
FOREIGN.
Ireland.—The proceedings in the Irish State
Prosecutions have received a check which, although
it cannot alter the ultimate result, will have the
effect of keeping up public excitement and solici
tude for a longer period than was at first contem
plated, or than would have been called for by more
honourable and straight-forward defendants than
Mr. O’Connell and his clerical and lay coadjutors.
The intention of the Crown was to fix the lllh of
December for the commencement of the trial,—a j
time to which it might have been imagined no rea- '
sonable objection could be raised, considering that
it would have allowed two months from the day of
arrest for the preparation of the defence,—and that,
moreover, the charges, although enveloped in the
technicalities of a voluminous indictment, have re
ference almost exclusively to facts, the proof or dis
proof of which cannot be difficult. However, it was
said and sworn that it would be impossible to have
the defence ready so soon, and the Attorney-Gene
ral,—as we think widely,—determined to acquiesce
in the claim for delay, so far as to postpone the trial
to the 15th of January, on which day the Court has
decided that it shall certainly come on. It has also
been agreed to strike a special' jury in the case,
the jurors to be taken not from the present lists,
but from the lists for the next year, the revision of
which is now going forward.
Rumours continue to be occasionally circulated
that the Government will, after all, abandon the
prosecutions. We cannot believe that they ever
contemplated a step which would render ail they
have hitherto done for the suppression of the repeal
agitation so much worse than useless. We question
whether a voluntary relinquishment of the proceed
ings by the Crown would not produce a more in
jurious effect than even a defeat on the trial. The
inference of the misguided people would inevitably
be that the Government was afraid to persevere.
It is all-important that the authority of the State
should be upheld, and that, if measures should be
pronosed for the amelioration of the condition of
Ireland—as we sincerely hope will be the case,—it
should be made sufficiently obvious that those con
cessions have not been extorted by terror fcam an
unwilling Legislature, but freely granted under the
promptings of Justice and Kindness—Watchman.
Mexico.—Lord Aberdeen, it is said, has declined
to enter into any negotiation with the Mexican Min
ister, Mr. Murphy, on the subject of the affront
lately offered to the British flag, and that he intends
sending out a new Minister to Mexico, in a frigate,
which will call at Jamaica, whence the Minister
will take a squadron down with him to the Mexican
coast, and require an apology for the affront before
landing. By the packet before the last, advice was
received that Mr. Doyle had made a remonstrance
to the Mexican Government on the subject of a
breach of contract between it and a British house
in Mexico, in such strong terraB, that the Govern
ment objected to the expressions. Mr. Doyle re
fused to retract a word, and the consequence was
that the Mexican Government sent a special mes
senger with despatches to Mr. Murphy, in London,
requesting him to complain to Lord Aberdeen of
the language in which it had been addressed.* This
grievance preceded the affair of the flag, and it
seems that Lord Aberdeen will not admit that the
Mexican Government had any just ground for
breaking the contract with the house in question.
The League Fund.—.The subscription to the
100,0001. fund is progressing. Last Friday evening
the total amount subscribed in Manchester and the
neighbourhood was 14,1331. Since then Messrs.
A. S. Henry and Co, and the Oxford-road Twist
Company, have given subscriptions of 2001. each ;
Messrs. H. Bannerman and Sons, and Messrs. Hyde,
Sons, and Sowerby, 1001. each, besides various
amounts of 501., 30., and smaller sums, including a
large number of 11. each from shopkeepers, who
last year gave no more than 5s., and many of them
nothing. Up to last evening, just a week from the
commencement of the subscription, its total amount
had reached 16,0001. There can now be no doubt
that Manchester will contribute at the least 20,0001.,
or one-fifth of the whole amount required.—Man
chester Journal.
Welch Riots.—Twenty-six Rebeccaites have
been apprehended for pulling down the gates and
destroying the toll-houses at Parkamorfa and Fish
guard on the 11th of September last. They were
examined before Mr. H. O. Owen, Vice-Lieutenant
of the county, and a full bench of magistrates, at
Fishguard. Wm. Owen, (the Lady Rebecca,)
James Gwynne, and Thomas Gwynne, were com
mitted to the next assizes, but held to bail, them
selves in 1001. each, and two securities in 501. each.
The others were committed, or held to bail, in lower
amounts. The excitement in the town was very
great, particularly as regarded the informants, j
Thomas Williams and his wife, who were obliged to
be guarded day and night from the barracks to the
Commercial Inn, where the magistrates sat.
Departure of the Duke and Duchess de
Nemours.—On Sunday morning, soon after ten
o’clock, the Duke and Duchess de Nemours, (who
had attended Divine service at a Roman Catholic
Chapel, after leaving Windsor Castle,) arrived at
Woolwich. Their Royal Highnesses were re
ceived with the usual demonstrations of respect,
and immediately embarked on board the French
steam-vessel Archimede, and proceeded down the
river. A little below Gravesend the Archimede run
aground on the Bligh Sand, about five o'clock, p. m.;
but, on the turn of the tide, the vessel floated, and
having,—fortunately,—sustained no ipjury, procee
ded on the voyage.
Continental News.—The Monileur of Mon
day, which, with the other Paris journals of that
date, we have received by our ordinary express,
publishes the following Royal ordinance :—“ The
Chamber of Peers and the Chamber of Deputies
are hereby convoked for the 27th of December,
1843.”—Times.
Madrid journals to the 21sthave arrived. In the
meeting of the Senate of that day, M. Frias, the
minister of marine, read a decree of the Queen,
appointing M. Olozaga president of the council. A
bill was afterwards read for suspending the opera
tion of the decree issued by the Cabinet of M. Lo
pez, for the renewal of the municipalities. No
discussion on this bill, however, took place ; the
Minister of the Interior, in concurrence with the
new President of the Council, requested that the
Chamber would delay it until the Ministry should
present a new measure on the subject. In the
Chamber of Deputies a similar communication, as
to the nomination of M. Olozaga, was made; and
the bill on the municipality was also read, but any
discussion was deferred for the same reason as in
fluenced the Senate.
The following telegraph dispatch was received
in Paris on Monday evening:—“Madrid, Nov. 24.
The Cabinet has just been re-constituted as fol
lows :—M. Olozaga, President of the Council and
Minister of Foreign Affairs; M. Luzuriaga, Grace
and Justice; M. Domeneeq, Interior; M. Cantero,
Finances; Mr. Serrano, War. M. Frias, Marine.”
A letter from Perpignan, dated Nov. 26, says :—
“ The free corps and national guard of Barcelona
have delivered up at the Atatazanas, 500 muskets.
Tranquility is completely restored. The emigrants
are returning. The manufacturers are resuming
their business. The captain-general is to go in
person, and assume the command of the troops
blockading the castle of Figueras. He has taken
with him six battalions.”
The French Minister of Marine has addressed a
circular to the maritime prefects, desiring that no
workman may in future be employed on Sundays in
the Government dockyards, except in cases of abso
lute necessity. The motives assigned by the min
ister for this order are,—first, that men who do not
repose on Sunday do not work with energy on the
other days of the week, and, consequently, that it
is not profitable to the state to have labour performed
on the Sabbath; and, secondly, that it is necessary
for the state to promote the religious observance of
Sunday amongst the labouring classes.
DOMESTIC.
Reported for the Southern Chrietian AdrocatA
Satement of the Charleston Cotton Market.
December 20,1843.
The Hibernia’s arrival brings us intelligence of
an advance in the Liverpool market of an eighth.
It yet remains to be ascertained what effect this
will have upon our market. We are still firm ; and
the tendency is upward. Quotations about the
same as for last week. In consequence of the
holidays, we have had but a limited demand for a
day or two past.
Novel Circumstance.--Rescuscitation.—'The
St. Louis Republican of the 7th instant relates the
following singular occurrence :—“ A young lady
belonging to a Jewish family in this city died on
Tuesday of a nervous disease, and yesterday her
friends started with her remains for interment
According to a Jewish custom, the body is taken to
the graveyard in a square box in the same covering
in which the deceased person has expired, and
there, in a house appropriated for that purpose, the
female friends of the family unrobe the body, wash
it with cold water, and anoint it for its last resting
place. While performing this ancient custom upon
the body of this supposed inanimate corpse, a
healthful warmth evaporated from it, and evident
signB of life became manifested ; the fact was an
nounced by the ladies, physicians were sent for,
and the sorrowful certainty of death which over
shadowed the countenances of friends gave place
to gleaming hope. On the arrival of the physicians
the certainty of her being alive was established, and
means taken to fan the spark into health, in which
we earnestly hope they may succeed.”
Results or Enterfrize.—The two principle
partners in one of the greatest banking houses in
the world, probably the largest discounters of bills,
were both servants, in the outset of their lives, and
blacked their employers’ boots. The paper which
they now discount, amounts to four hundred mil
lions a year. Almost all the decisions are made by
one of these men, who is so familiar with his business
and the responsibility of business men, that he runs
a handful of acceptances through his hands and
pronounces upon them, in less time than a bank
teller pays his bank notes for a check. The re
cources of the house are so vast, that the Bank of
England has found itself quite unable to dictate to
them or to indulge in rivalry with them. One of the
partners, it is said, on good authority, is in the habit
of giving away, from his share of the profits, a hun
dred thousand dollars annually.—N. Y. Jour, of
Com.
Atlantic Steamers.—We learn that the Com
pany have another magnificent steamship on the
stocks at Glasgow, which will be ready for launch
ing a few weeks. She is to take her place in the
line of next June, under the command of Captain
Judkins, who by the way is a splendid specimen of
I humanity. He is to superintend the construction
| and fitting up of the new steamer.
It is said that the favourite Hibernia is to pap into
the hands of Captain Ryrie, now of the Acadia,
and that the latter fine steamship will be placed
under the command of Capt. Shannon, formerly of
the Columbia.
All the steamers of this line will be in complete
order to take their place in the New York trade
early next spring.—N. Y. Herald.
Distresses of Moneyed Men.—They say that
a Bank in New England having twenty thousand
dollars lying there which could not be wanted fora
short period, sent down three directors to loan it in
some way perfectly safe. The committee spent
some time here, ana finally succeeded in getting
satisfactory security, and interest at the rate of two
and a half per cent. On returning home and ma
king up their accounts, it was found that the expen
ses of the embassy a little exceeded the interest
which would accrue upon the loan.—N. Y. Journal
of Commerce.
New Movement in Steam Navigation.—It is
stated that a firm in Boston intend building, before
spring, six steamers, to be propelled by the Erices
sion screw, for the Albany trade. They are to be
constructed of iron, and of three Hundred tons capa
city, and are to run between Troy, Albany and Bos
ton. They will make the passage, it is thought, in
about forty hours. Flour is to be carried in them
at fifteen cents a barrel, to the injury perchance of
the Western Railroad.
,
Audubon,—The ornithologist, has arrived at
Pittsburg. He had with him a number of large
boxes filled with specimens of rare animals and
birds, and also a living deer, fox and badger. He
also brought two large rocks, perfectly spherical,
one of which weighed two hundred and eighty
pounds, which he procured in the bed of a small
river at the head waters of the Missouri, called the
Cannon Ball river, from the fact that large numbers
of rocks are found in it resembling cannon balls in
shape and color.
Bridge Across the Ohio.—Memorials are in
circulation in the west, asking congress to provide
for the construction of a wire suspension bridge
across the Ohio, at the junction of the National
Road with said river. The estimated expense is
$130,000. According to the plan designated, there
is to be a space of fifty leet between the bridge and
the tops of the highest steamboat pipes, at an ordi
nary stage of water, rendering it free from any
objection on the ground of obstruction to navigation.
A New Way to Frighten Rats_A gentleman
of Thomaston, Maine, says he has discovered a new
way to frighten rats, lie says that he was so much
disturbed one night by their gnawing the partition
of his sleeping apartment that lie arose and filled up
the hole they were making. But this was of no
avail. They returned with a reinforcement, and j
renewed the work with redoubled vigor. He then
hunghis watch over the hole, and in a few minutes
they all dispersed and he has not heard one since.
A Thrifty Region.—The Chattanooga (Tenn.)
Gazette has accounts from correspondents that in
the neighboring Look-out Valley, Georgia, Mr. John
W. Smith has just harvested one hundred and twenty
bushels of corn from an acre; a neighbor lias a pump
kin measuring 63 by 53£ inches; and Mrs. Win.
Jones, of the same neighborhood, has just presented
her husband with three fine daughters. These
were born just over the state line; had they been born
on the Tennessee side, they would have each been
entitled to a portion of 200 acres of land from the
state.
Importance of Agriculture.—Mr. Ellsworth
says, in his last Report to Congress, that 83 in every
100 of the present population are inevitably con
nected with or dependent upon agriculture, from
which they derive their food and raiment, their
whole means of moral, religious, and intellectual
progress, and that wealth too, essential to individual
liberty and national independence.
Noble Charitv.—William Appleton, Esq., of
this city has placed in the hands of the trustees of
the Massachusetts General Hospital, $10,000; the
income of which is to be applied in adding such
patients in the McLean Asylum for the insane, as
from straitened means might be compelled to
leave the institution without a perfect cure.—Bos
ton Mercantile Journal. *
The Galvanic Telegraph.—-A letter from
Washington says:—
“I met on my way to Washington some of the
parties engaged in laying down the Telegraph Gal
vanic pipes between Washington and the city of
Baltimore. In about twenty days it is supposed
the work will be completed. It extends already as
far as the Relay House.
New Species of Cotton.—A very beautiful
specimen of cotton, raised in Hinds county, has
been shown the editors of the Raymond Farmer.
The bolls are very large, and contain five divisions,
one more than usual. A hand can pick of it fifty
pounds more per day than any other kind.—Jackson
Miss., Reporter.
Valuable Apparatus for Counterfeiting.—
The Philadelphia Police have discovered in that
city an apparatus used for counterfeiting Bank
notes. The apparatus is believed to be worth from
$10,000 to $15,000 and was stolen about three
years ago from Mr. Mason a bank note engraver.
British Minister.—The London Gazette, of
November 14tb, contains the official announcement
of Richard Packenham, late Minister to Mexico, to
be Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipoten
tiary to the United States.
Banks of New-York_On the first of Novem
ber, 1843, the banks of New-York, had $37,389,160
of deposits due on demand; notes in circulation
$17,313,101. Specie $11,003,797,—Discounts,
$63,207,130,—Capital $43,000,185. .

SEARS’ NEW AND COMPLETE HISTORY
OF THE BIBLE.
In referring to this work it is not necessary that we
enter into long details; let it suffice that we affirm that
the most learned and enlightened of our countrymen
agree in pronouncing it well worthy of the patronage of
every Christian, together with all who refer to the Bible
as a Text Book. It is written in a plain and open style,
which can be as easily understood by the ignorant as by
the educated. It has been remarked by many that the
Bible is written in so obscure a style that few can com
prehend it. Here then we have it expounded and com
mented upon at length, with notes, both critical and ex
planatory, by men who have made it the study of years;
forming of itself a History of near four thousand years.
1'wo volumes in one, containing near seven hundred large
octavo pages with several hundred engravings, bound In
the most finished style. Price only S3. For sale by

LA GRANGE FEMALE ACADEMY.
AT the examination of the pupils in November last,
on motion of one of the young ladies of the School,
and urged by several others, the good citizens of the vil
lage and its vicinity, aided by several warm-hearted
friends of female education from different parts of the
State, and one or more from a sister State, amounting to
more than sixty in number, of all ages and denomina
tions, contributed of their gold, silver, and bank bills, to
repair and enlarge the old Female Academy in La
Grange, Ga., which the Trustees hope to have completer)
by the opening of the School on the First Monday in
January next.
The Academy is situated in the most beautiful grove,,
and in one of the most retired par&‘8f*tne town, and
convenient to several good boarding houses. Well,
says the parent or guardian, your house, its location, and
grove will do, but who are the Teachers') The sub
scriber would refer you to the Board of Trustees, who
are,—S. Duggar, Judge Lewis, R. Broome, Thomas
Greenwood, D. Me Mi Men, Dr. Hill, and Major Bull.
I think any and all of these men will tell you the
Teachers have attended closely to their business, and the
pupils learned well. But, says the honest and faithful
parents, these Trustees are interested, and they have con
siderable competition in Schools about La Grange, I
should like to hear what the patrons of the school say.
Then the subscriber would refer you to Judge Harris,
Dr. Coleman, Rev. C. W. Key, Hon. H. A. Haralson,
Hon. W. T. Colquitt, Hon. J. C. Alford, Major J. E.
Morgan, and William Dougherty, Esq.
An, says the plain farmer, (the prop of the Church and.
support of the world,) “ how fond this Teacher is of big
names.” Not so fond as he is to refer to men who are
generally known, and men of candor and veracity.—
Many others he might refer to, who, though not so con
spicuous in this world, will, probably, die as happy, and
occupy as high a scat in the kingdom of Heaven. These
men, lie thinks, would corroborate the statement of the
Trustees. But perhaps that parent, who is anxious to
see his daughters educated before he bids them farewell
and returns to his mother dust, would prefer having the
additional testimony of the Pupils of tne school. Well,
we will give you what we think they would say. In ad
dition to the statement of their Fathers, they will gener
ally tell you,—“ The Principal scolds too much, and
whips rattier too severely; but when every thing goes on
smoothly, when we have good lessons, ana preserve good
order, he is kind, agreeable, and playful as a child. Of
the assistant Teacher, they would say, and justly say
every thing that is good without any mixture of bad.
The subscriber commenced teaching in 1831, and has
sjH'nt most of the time since then in the arduous .but, to
him, pleasant occupation of instructing youth. He con
siders himself permanently settled, anu hopes to make it
the interest of Parents and Guardians to patronize his
School. Our prices are lower than in the other schools
of the village. The branches are such as are usually
taught in Academies of high character. We have a
go<3 Philosophical Apparatus, and intend adding as
1 soon as convenient. JOHN PARK..
