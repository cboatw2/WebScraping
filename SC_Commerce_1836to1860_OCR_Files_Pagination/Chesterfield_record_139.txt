Abstract from the report of the Secretary of the
Treasury. According
to the Treasurer's running
: account the whole amount of available monov
in the Treasury on the 1st of January
1837, applicable to public purposes, was
$42,468,859,97. From that sum there
were on that day reserved 85,000,090; and
the balance being 836,463,859.97, was
under the provisions of the act of June 23,
1836, to be placed in deposite with the
States, ft is ascertained that 27,063,430,
8'Jofit have since been actually received by
litem.
Tne amount of that portion of the first
rhree instalments, the payment of which
i has not been acknowledged, through transfers
were seasonably issued for it, is 81
195,575,18. The remainder is 89,367,
214,98, and is tne sum which was designed
for the fourth enstalmcnt-o' ce )0> tcs with
the States on the 1st of October next. - The
amount reserved in the Treasury on the Is
t af January has since been increased by rei
turns subsequently received from banks
L to the sum of $6,970,137,5*2; and which
r! c?Fcourse, eoeld not then bo ascertained n

d To these may be added about $600,0'
which remained in tiie hands of receive

h that half of the year 813,137,182. If i
- further pustponmenl be gran ed oik du

for the last half of the year, from ail som e
^ will be about 89,500,030; which woi
make thorn as ascertained an I estimated i

there will probably be a necessity to rest
'' to the deposites now with the States, anJ
.he instalments destined for them in Octob
" or to some other resources, for a sum oqj
s ,o 810,000,000.
J Hv a report of the Treasurer of the 30
11 ul, it appears that the balance in the Tre
^ sury including, what was in the custody
L banks, the Mm , and collectingofficers, w
tlicn ^ 14.090,311 ; that the amount of tl:
1 subject to immediate drafts was only 8
' 1*9.8,072; but the whole balance in the Tre
sury including all which had been deposit
' with the States, and ordered to be, thou;
1 only a snail part ottlie amount issubjeci
* immediate drafts, was 841,032,381. Dedu
all which has been, and was designed to I

deposited with the States, and there wou
s. ; be no balance left on baud subject to dra
. | though the including every thmg in the mi
f| and in the poscssion of receivers and c(
lecters, which is applicable to general purp
ses.
Hence it is probable, that, besides the d
, ficicncv for the expenditures of the ye
. no sufficient means of any kind will exi
i on the first of October next, after defravir
.? the intervening expense, to complete tl
. j ins'alm iit of deposites then payable, unlc

Destruction' of the Abolition* newstaper
office in Alton.?We learn from
\ Alton, that the materials of the Observer
M - office in that town, were completely destroy.
W ed by a party of the citizens on Monday
night las:, between ten and twelve
o'clock. For several weeks past, the editor
)of the Observer has been repeatedly warned,
first by a public meeting of the citizens,
$ * and afterwards by conferences of a commit\
tee with him, and by many of the citizens,
-111
that the course lie was pursuing wouiu wring
\ upon him the indignation of the people and
\ the destruction of his establishment. iJe
P would not, it seems, stop or change his
s course, and accordingly he lias been made
I to sutler for bis obstinacy.
The party by whom the act was oonsumated
met Mr. Lovcjoy, before the demolition
of the office, and were disposed lo intlict
upon his person some gross indignity;
but upon his appealing to them in supj^.cating
tones, to be spared, on account of his
family, they sufierd him to pass unharmed.
On their approach, lo the office they found
it guarded by numbers of the abolitionists.
Their measures however, were speedily taken,
and availing themselves of the protection
of a wall in the neighborhood of the building,
they poured a volley of stones upon
persons in and about the office. One man
- received a severe blow upon the head, and
then the office was abandoned. Fifty or sixty
stand of arms were found in the office?

The Madisonian at Washington has come
t against the "sub Treasury system" recommded
by tue President in his message; that
the project to have the possession and con>1
of the revenue in the hands of the Presiat
himself and officers of the Treasury
pointed by him. The Richmond Enquirer
[1 the New York Times, two of the most
luential of the administration prints, have
0 taken a ve * decided stand against it, and ,
1 Albany Argus, one of the ultra papers on
i same side, advocates it only as a tempo- (
y expedient. From these evidences of pubopinion
(for if they do not originate in publiG
nion, they will contribute in no small degree
form it) we consider it very improbable that (
; shernc wiil succeed.
We extract the following sentences from a
g article in the Richmond Enquirer on the ]
iject.
"Such is the general character of the int.
rtant document which we now lay before 1
rrcaiers. We have read it with every 1
ipoct for the aoilitv and hones! y of 'is au- J
,r?wiili the deepest attachment to the (
in?and with every desire to promote the 1
rcess of his Administration. We have
examined his propositions, re-pused his
rumen's, and sought to disabuse our mind
all its prejudices and prepossessions. In
i same frank spirit in which he has adjssed
his countrymen, we respectfully say,
it we still differ from the course which he j
i chalked out. We shall state our opin. ,
ts freely, but briefly; for wc ore pressed
for room. Heaven knows, that we "set
down nought in malice!" Mr. Van Buret] "
himself knows us better. We consider it
peculiarity unforluua'c, at tiiis time, that alt
the friends of the Administration cannot go
. together. * >
Wo have r.o desire to see such an accu. '.
mutation of power in the hands of the Exe.
cu'ivc; no wis!j to put the j>ubl.*c money di.
rec'.'y into the palms ci* his friends and par.
tisuns. We wish to see the power and patjoaaga
of the Executive increased as line
as possible; the power of the ? Federal] Gov. . .
.eminent [not] enlarged;' the purse and tlie
sword not more strongly united than they
"are in the hands of the ['resident, and as tew . .
means of corruption as possible trusted in
his possession. Some events, iravc drifted
i the balance of the Constitution, and thrown
too much power already into the Executive
scuL?thanks especially to the Whiir Sena;
? cy
tors, who fought so recklessly for the Bank *
oft Ik.' United Stales, m the day of panic
trampled their instructions under foot, and
brought their own bfody lutojcontempt! We . . have
no desirC, unless the public interests
imperiously demand it, to throw greaterweight
into the Executive scale, by bring.pg
the President into closer contract with the
public purse. We have no uneasiness about
the present incumbent.
'But the Message fritters away the extent
of this patronage. It states the num.
ber of oflicers as very few; the amount of
moneys in their hands as-small; and the addi,ional
expenses as riot exceeding ^0,000
a year. But these wore not considered as
i slight objections in 1834; and we cannot
permit ourselves ?o undervalue them now..

In the House an exciting subject has been
introduced by Mr. Adams, and cne which we
apprehend, is likely to shake the Unicn to its
centre. It was a resolution calling upon the
President to inform the House whether any
porpositibn had been made by Texas for an.
nexation to the United States; .and if .so wbat
was the answer returned: and calling also for .
the c orrespondence on tha subject. We shall
next week copy part cf the desultory debate
on the subject. We have now time only to stato
that Mr. Wise opposed the resolution on the
ground that the correspondence is not now in
a state to be published without injury to the ?
public interest. Severe! members spoke brief- iy.
Mr Adams, in the course of his remarksi
said ''It is a question so deep as to in volte the
union itself: for there is a large 'portion of the
people of the Uuited States who would prefer disolulion
of the union to the act of annexation of
Texas." After an amendment by the addition
of a qualifying clause, "ifin his opinion consis.
tent with the public interest," the lesoluticn
was adopted.
A resolution lias been adopted in the House
to confine its action to the business for which
congress was called.
Fatal accident fkom a balloon ascension.?The
London papers give a detailed
account of the structure of a parachute, attached
to a balloon, in which a man was to
ilescend after separating it from the baboon,
Owing to some defect in the construction or
mipagement of the parachute, it oscillated bo
violently in its descent when separated from
the balloon that the basket containing the unfortunate
adventurer became detached from it
it the height of several hundred feet, and was
precipitated, of course with great rapidity.?
The man was literally dashed to pieces.
