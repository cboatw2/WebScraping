Col. Barry Gillispie, New-Orleans.
Dear Col.-l can ot'er this assurance,
that advantages sufficient are disclosed in
the manner of invasion to insure the most
perfect success, if the army are subordinate
to orders-Triumph cannot elude us nn
less disorder prevails in our ranks.
The arrival ofemgrants, in the country
and their anxiety for active employment
and the want ofprovisions, a ill not allow
the time desirable for complete prepara
tion; but with the aid of our friends in the
States, we can sustain our cause. Tex
as cannot recede. We can no longer re
main subject to marauding incursions ofthe
enemy. Our independence must be recog
nized by Mexico There is a substantial
cause of war. which appears to every man
ly, chivalrous and generous heart-it is the
relentless and cruel bondage of our broth
ers of Santa Fe, many of whom perilled
their lives on the heights of San J acinto.
Their liberation is the task of Texas, and
if she is unaided by her friends. and left to
battle alone, site will maintain the conflict.
and never yield until her star is crimsoned
and herlost banner shall be bathed in blood.
Your friend,
SAM. IhOUSTON.
Extract of a letter from an Executive of
ficer of Texas.
Barry Gillispie, Esq..
General Agent of Texan. New Orleans.
Dear Col.-if any volunteers are corn
ing send them on. The matter must short
lybe brought to an issue. The period to
which delay cai be extended for assistence
from the United States is drawing near.
lf we receive none, Texas will march to
the conflict like a young giant. sin:le han
ded and alone. The bright beanis of the
single star will soon be reflected from ihe
rushing tide of the Rio Grande. We have
erectedthe banner of a glorious destiny.
aud soon it will resume its westward way,
supported by strong arms and brave hearts.
Let those then who %ould participate in
the trials as well as the triumphs of a sol
dier's life, come arid come quickly. The
field is laid o-pen to the chivalry and enter
prise of our brethren of other lands as well
as our own citizens. The Mexican tyrant
bs taunted. ha% challenged the prowess
Cytpow er of the people of the greatvalley
Vilje Mississippi. Will they not eet
his champions on the sautqyplains of the
(arSputh Wxot? Will Americans linger
in view of the field of strife while 4meri
cans fight fciriedom and the extension of
meral and intellectual light. Tell them
to come and share the peril and enjoy the
prize. You know the conditions. Let
them be in all thitigs complied with.
Success will greatly depend upon proper
preparatton.
We have just learned officially throug~h
a Texian Agent, that forty-nine emigrants
arrived yesterday in this place from East
Tennessee for Texas. They are hteaded
by Capt. Cofley, and will leave in a few
*days for their destination. We Icea that
they are of the immortal Crockett "go
ahead" order, and if so, who can predict
their success. These emigrants wsill be
conveyed to Texas by the steamer Tom

trade by Cotnmodore Moore and the patri

ceived a letter from our attentive corres
pondent at Newnansv'lle, uner date of the
23d .May, to 14 hom we tender our thanks
for his politeness. whichi gives us further
particulars of the horrid barbarities com
mitted by the gang of ludians that passed
through Alachua ciounty on tie 15th instant.
After their murder of Mr. Casain's fami
Iy, they attacked the house of Ar. Absalom
Snowden, not Mr. W. II. Ward, as itated
ia our last, and killed hatin and three chii
dren. and Mrs. S. they wounded in seven
places, and left her fordead.
After netting the house on fire they took
the children about 200 yards fromt the flames
of their dwelling and shot them, one by one
with arrows, in sigit of their mother. ;and
killed them all before they molested her!
A refinement of torture, this, that oul finds
place in this savage breast, and thait no
civilized being would conceive. She
swooned and has no recollection of the de
parture of the Indians. It is believed she
will recover. She is under care of Dr. J.
P. Crichton.
On the morning of the 17th they killed
2 soldiers near Wacahootee, and on the
same day, Lieit. Bkitton was in search of
the party, and came upon them while in
ambush. The Indianis fired con his ad
vance, and wounded three men. They
fled precipitately. The citizens and troops
are in searchof them day an-I night. Capt.
Kerr's company of Dragilons has been in
pursit of them, as also Capt. Sewell's
company of Infantry. tnt all unsuccessful.
On the 21st inst. the Indians were at Col.
F. R. Sanchez's plantation. at St. Felasco
hammock. Capt Sew-ll and a party of
citizens had gone out on the hunt after them
and had not returned when the -mail left.
'The writer concludes by anying. and justly
too, *If this is peace, we never want to
hear of war."
A corresipo-dent of the News writers
(Newnin-ville. Mliy 19) to its editors:
"r. Snowden. after her three children
were deliberately ntirder-d before her
eyes, was, although begging for her life,
shot with a rifle and with arrows, and
stabbed in several places. and left fiar dead.
An arrow has been taken front her, and
another from one of her children; they are
both barbed with iron or steeL something
in the form of a harpoon, and were shot
with such fierce as to go through the body
of Mrs. Snowden. A smill party of five
men were at the Mill. distant half a mile
from Snon' den's %% ho heard the rifles and
yells of the ludians, andl the' screams and
cries for mercy of Mrs. Snowden, but to
go to their assistane was almost certain

the creek was % ay-Iayed by the Indians.
and had they gone it) their assistance, it is
altogether probable the whole would have
perished. On Monday evening, a Com.
pany of Dragoons, under Captain Kerr,
arrived here, (Newnansville) having trail
ed the Indians (probably the same part%)
front the direction of the Wacassa. The
Dragoons, and Captain Sewell's Company

parties, bunted for them on Tuesday, and
discovered that they had cone from this
