For the Advertiser.
Mr. Editor :-1 was at the Barbecue at
Hill's Old Field, on the Saluda side of the
District, on the 91h instant, and was pleased
to see see several of our candidates for the
Legislature, called u pon to express their
sentiments, or in other words to address
the company.
They acquitted themselves with credit.
Gave sanction to all, and reviewed the
most featnrs of the Democratic creed,
such as the::spposition to an United States
Bank, the distribution of the proceeds of
the public land, the policy of internal im.
provement -as carried on by the General
Government, and dwelt with great force
end energy upon the present unjust. odious
and oppressive. tariffof '42, showing con
clusively to every reflecting mind its opera
tiors, and the great amount of tax payed
in the' way 'of duty by ,the-South for the
o~ction of Northern manufactures, and
astly gave their hearty assent to the an
vexatiou of Texas to the U. States, briefly
showing the strength it would not only give
the South, but the wVhole Union.
-While they were haranguing the compa
ny it struck me forcibly that they were ein
-didates for seats in the State Legislature
-and not for Congress, and I should have
'been better entertained if part of their ad
dressea had consisted in pointing out some
of the evils under which wo labor in our
. State government. and directing our minds
to the remedy, and the course theygill
pursue if elected.

SLAVERY IN ENGLAND AND IN
THE UNITED STATES.
Lord Brougham. and other philantro
pists by profession in Great Britain, have
made a great noise about the case of a
man in South Carolina, who was senten
ced to be hanged for slave stealing. They
held up one of the American States as the
only civilized community in the world in
which such a penalty for such an offence
was authorized by law.-The fact of the
case however is that the law in question
was an English law passed in 1750, while
South Carolina was under British rule. It
had remained obsolute on the statue book,
its existence scarcely known, until the
occasion referred to, when the State's At
torney found himself obliged to urge it
against the prisoner. The matn, however
wds pardoned, and there was an end of the
matter,
Judge O'Neal, before whom the caso
came, has given a-brief history of the affair
which is published in the Glasgow papers
In the course of his letter the Judge asks.
"Is Scotland free from the sin of slave
ry-white slavery? Are there no task
masters in Englanid, Scotland, and Ireland,
who can vie with thze very worst amongst
us!? Compare our slaves, negroes though
they be, with your white servants, your
starving laborers, your suffering tenantry ;
and if they have not more comforts, more
happiness, South Carolinians will be con
tent to be branded as merciless tyrants.
But until the condemnation is brought
about, we say to your censors, Physician,
heal thayself."
The'London Times, comnmen itng on the
Judge's fetter, is constrained to make these
admissions: "The dijference bettoeen
England and Carolina is, that our wohite
slaver are so cheap that the people will not
buy them. They are a drug in the mai
keg. It is the interest of the em ployer to
leuve them asfree as possible. The selsh
ness of powoer and woealth, of land ad cap.
ital.. tells not directly on the indwvidual
*'ohite.slazve.' but on the system of the wohole
laboring mass."
eThis is a pretty fair exposition of servi
tude in England. The slavery of English
laborers- is thet of a caste. "it is the inter
est of the employe~r to have them as free as
possible."., ,That. is..to.say, the domestic
relation between the remployer .and the
laborer is .as -slight .as. possible-for te
reason that .the former vanl.sahe service
of ;he. other, withouit..incurring-responsi

This arisesfrom ihe difference in oar-minds.

Scontrariety of vie ws on important
g ts. We can see much wisdom in
rangement. This want of unifor
juevenrsanatinn of thouott and
conduces to the vigor, and expansion of
the- intellect by the very-,Collision it produ
ces. .There are .iniajlqqtal causes whichi
increase'' this diverstt, yiz:-education,
prejudice, association, interest,_ ambition. I
That thdse who agwree in.thought'should.
desire to promote their %iews and asso
ciate witheach othet 4ha' thei strength
may be combined for gria er 'elliciency.,ts
perfectly reasoiable. . H.ehe the.various I
sdcieties, religious, noral -and civil. . But
a question arrises here. how far should one
surrender himself to his party ? Unques
tionably some concessions must be made, 1
or we must presently dissolve our connec
tion with every association, and maintain
an isolated position. We suppose that all
will agree, -that the rights.of private judg-.
ment and of conscience ought to he retained
by every individual member. If these are
to be given up, the worst sort of despo
tism is established. True. there ought to
be submission to the will of the majority
in many instances; but thisshould be lim
ited. It should be confined invariably to.
cases of pure expediency. Submission. to
party should uever be urged farther than
this : for be it remembered, we can never
merge our individual responsibility to
GOD, AND OUR COUNTY in our par
tyism. The obligation remains as long as'
we have a God, and a Country. Again:
the evils consequent upon an improper ex
tension of party authority are of the most
fearful magritude. It was this that made
the revolution of the French so terrible a
calamity. Maximillian Robespierre would
have been powerless, but for the Mountain
party, which required from its members
implicit submission, or gave them the
guillotine as the alternative. History is
replete with instances which confirm our
assertion.
The common phrase, "ny party, right
or wrong," has no foundation in reason or
in religion. No one who makes this his
sentiment, and acts upon it, is a freeman.
He is the slave of others. though his service
is voluntary. His party dictates, and he
is their "very humble and obedient ser
vants." Such a mah stripshimself ol' the
habiliments of freedom-gives up his heri
tage-brutalizes himself as far as ie can,
by the voluntary sacrifice of reason and of
conscience,
There is no patriotism in the sentiment;
for it withdraws all -allegiance from our
country and bestows it on a faction. He
who supports a party in the wrong, wars
against his country, and is a traitor.
The sentiment is impious; for it ungods
the deity. and deifies humanity. Does
God condemn the wrong? Yes, responds
the advocate of implicit submission,: but
"the party" approves it. Can there. be
any thing more repugnant to the spirit of
religion ?
How nobly our friends.in South Caroli
na come up to their duties-how gloriously
they meet and overcome the obstacles
thrown in their way, whether by opponents
or by limid friends ! The Edgefeld Ad
vertiser, Extra, in givioh us the proceed
ings of the late State Temperance Con
vention, exhibits to our delighted eyes a
picture well worthy of imitation by all who
would present American society without
spot or blemish to the admiring gaze of
the world. What zeal is lisplayed in the
number of delegates in attendance ur.on
the meeting-what teal and wisdom.too.
in the whole character of the proceeuings?
And how admirably does the address to
the citizens justify the course of the soci
ety, and expose to just cen.<ure. the oppo
sition of its enemies; or feeble friends !
Breihren of Carolina, we admire your
excellent cond'uct-wd will labor to have it
imitated on this side of the Savannah !
