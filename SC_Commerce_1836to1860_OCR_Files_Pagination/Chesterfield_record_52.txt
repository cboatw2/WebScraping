CmturicoiETEttS.?The British governmorn
allows a premium annually, of ?5,000
to the manufacturers of the best chronometers
on a trial of 12 months. This valuable
instrument has attained the highest state of
perfection. At a recent award of premiums
several were found to have erred in their
ratio only 65, 63 and 79 hundredths of a
second in 12 montlis. The 1st, 2d and 13d
premiums were awarded to these three.?
The great perfection this instrument has
been brought to, convinces us that no vessel
should be sent to sea without a good chronometer
to aid in ascertaining the longitude.
FlUunderwriters should insure at aless premium
when good chronometers are on board
the vessel to be insured. It is unusual for
a British vessel to put to sea without a chronometer,
and in many instances not less than
three are carried, and in their ships of war
always three, and frequently four.
Baltimore Railroads.?We learn from
the Gazette that the amount received for
fr^itrht nn the main line of the Baltimore
? -- - ----- ?
and Ohio Railroad during the month of August
last, exceeded the receipts in August
of the preceding year, #1,422 50.
The whole receipts in August on the main
line of the Railroad were as follows:
For passengers $12,003 23
Freight 12,294 43
24,302 71
Proportion of receipts for th? first
3 miles from Baltimore to Washington
: : 2,735 00
Total receipts for August, 1836 27,037 71
Receipts for August, 1835 23,300 23
Increase during the year 3,887 43
The gross receipts on tho Washington
Branch of the road, in August last, were $15,b94
14.
The gross receipts on the Utica and Schenectady
railroad in August last, for travelling
alone, amounted to 844,676 91.
Increase of Boston.?Rv the official returns
of * he census just taken oftheponula
tion of this city, it appears that in 1930 the
population of the city was 61,391; in 1835
it was 76,603, showing an increase of 17,2'2*2
in five years. According to this rate
Huston, in 1910, will contain more than
100.000 inhabitants, and in 1960, something
like '250,000.

Bills of Exchange.?An Act has just
passed the British Parliament, which settles
a disputed point in regard to bills of exchange
in that country, ;uid which ought,
therefore, to l>c known to men of business
generally. The point alluded to is that respecting
acceptors or referees for houor in
which no uiforni practice existed, some
houses presenting the bills so marked on
the day when they became due, and others
the day after. It is declared, however, that
it shall not be necessary to present such bills
of exchange until the day following that on
which they become due, and if the address
of the acceptors or referees for honor should
be in any other place than that in which the
bills shall be made payable, they need not

The excuse offered for this factious movement

asmuch as this unfair representation in the

is their duty violently to break up the

The establishment of an express mail between
New York and New Orleans by the
way of Washington, which is in contemplation,
seems to us to be liable to serious objection.
As the Post Office Department was created
for the benefit of the entire community and not
for any particular portion, it would seem unjust
to make a discrimination, in the transportation
of letters, between the wealthy and persons
not in affluent circumstances. The imposition
of a triple postage will operate seriously
to the disadvantage of those possessed of
only limited means?men beginning life, who
cannot submit to extra expense?whilst large
operators, men of capital, will be enabled to receive
their information in advance of the regular
mail by paying what to them is an amount
not worthy of consideration.
The reasoniug of the above paragraph from
the Baltimore American would apply as well
to all mail accommodation as to the express
mails Tiptthpn the mails be discontinued al
together because they give an advantage to
the man able to pay postage over him who is
not. All expense in support of a navy for the defence
of commerce is also wrong because it is
only for the benefit of the merchant who has
wealth or credit enough to engage in foreign
trade. The expense of keeping tip public roads
ought also to be dispensed with because these
roads are of greater advantage to the man
who can afford to travel in his carriage, or
who sends the produce of his farm to market
in his wagon or cart than to him whose poverty
compels him to dispense with these conveniences
; and indeed all expense of government,
and all government itself ought to be

Semitic?, of Newbern, N. C., copied into
the last number of your paper, on the subject
of an enterprise commenced by Capt. Taylor,

sufficient amount of money to purchase and lit

the purpose of aiding Texas in her present

all acquainted with the present weak state of

the expediency of the undertaking under consideration.
Should Texas have not a larger
number of armed vessels this winter, there is
good reason to apprehend that her ports will be
blockaded and supplies cut off. It is under[
stood that the Mexicans have made and are
' still making strenuous exertions to regain
o o
their lost territory; not only by multiplying
their land forces, but by procuring a considerable
fleet of armed vessels to prevent all intercourse
with Texas by sea. While thousands
of spirited Americans have rushed to the res-,
cue, and are now swelling the ranks of the
Texian army, but little has been done in a
Naval point of view. An armed Brig, especially
when commanded by an experienced
and daring seaman, would be no small acquisition
to the Navy of Texas. Capt. Taylor,
when last heard from by the writer, was in
Montgomery, Ala., having already raised
about 816,000. We suppose the amount required
by the enterprise will be 850,000. He
has probably by this time reached Augusta;
and intends visiting unarieston in nis tour
northward. Thus affording to the citizens of
these, and other cities that he may revisit, an
opportunity of evincing their sympathy in the
sufferings of an infant but dauntless nation,
endeavoring to throw off the yoke of an unprincipled
and blood-thirsty enemy. G. H.

We learn, by a letter from an intelligent
gentleman residing in one of the Indian nations
west of Arkansas that "
"The Indian country, at this time, is in a
state of considerable excitement. The Creeks
and Cherokees have held a secret council, at
which, it is believed, they formed an alliance,
to sustain the present Creek chie? Roly Mcintosh,
in authority, against the claims of
Nea Math la, who was the second chief of all
the Creeks east, and is now at the head of a
numerous band of his people, approaching
their new country west. A great national
ball-play took place, a few days ago, in a remote
part of the Cherokee nation, where it is
supposed, their plans were developed to the
great body of the Cherokee people. But
nothing has as yet happened, or is like to happen,
to disturb the slumbers of the good people

From the Mobile Commercial Register, Sept. 14
Erom Lieutenants Grason and Dunn, of the
United States Army, we have received information
of the arrangements made by Gen. Jessup
for the prosecution of the fall campaign
against the Seminoles.
About the 1st of September, the Tennessee
troops under Gen. Armstrong marched for
Tallahassee. On the 10th, the regular troops
i t ... c? n: i i- ? w?.
uuuer vxeu. j etc up, were iduiug uaciv on r on
Mitchell, preparatory to their embarkation for
Florida. The force destined for the campaign
consists of 600 regulars, 500 marines, 1,000
Creek warriors, 1,600 Tennessee volunteers *
now in service. These troops with the exception
of the Tennessee company, which proceeded
by land, will be transported down the Chat
tahoochee, and thence in Steamboats, which
steps have been taken to have at Appalachicola
by the 25th instant, to Fort Brooke, Tampa

The Indian warriors engaged by Gen. Jessup
confidently predict that there wDJ be no
fighting. They say that the Seminoles will
surrender, as did their people, when they see
arrayed against them those who know how to
fight them, and from whom, instead of opposition,
they have all along expected countenance
and co-operation. It is to be hoped
these predictions will be verified. For two .
months to coine, noxious damps and unwholesome
vapors will brood over the swamps and
everglades of Florida, more deadly than tho

the arduous service be permitted to return to

requisitions are made to sustain the United
States force at this place until reinforcements
can arrive at this place from Gen. Gaines, viz :
Sixty-four from San Augustine, fifty-sirjrom
Sabine, and thirty-three from Bevu. Hie
troops will repair to this place, with the least
possible delay, and report to the commanding
General as soon as they arrive.
This call is made through the judges of the
several counties, and must be regarded as the

send reinforcements to this place, they will
be discharged.
