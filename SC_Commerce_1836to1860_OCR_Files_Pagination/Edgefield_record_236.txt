Extracts from the Hon. Chas. Shepard's
Address, to the Freemen of the fourth
Congressional District of N. Carolina.
I am opposed to the establishment of a
National Bank, or the existence 'of any
corporation, whose power and whose bu'
siness pervade the whole Confederacy.
It is not to be denied, that a Federal
Institution is a convenient agent to the
Secretary of the Treasury. The rev
enue, wherever collected, can be depos
ited there, and wherever needed, can be
disbursed through its various branches;
and if regard be had only to the ease of
publi" officers,or the despa'ch with which
credit canl lie transported, a National Bank
is :he most appropriate instrument. But
it is not indispensably necessary. The
commercial relations ot the Union, enable
the Bank to perform the duty above men
tioned. and the saie reasoni will put it in
the power of the Government to expend
is mn.ey t hrough its own officers. Most
ol the reyenue is collected in New York,
and sone of it is wanted in Missouri. The
merchants of the latter State purchase their
goods in the former, and are always glad
to have funds where their debts are paya
ble; and if the money of the Government
be in safe hands at New York, a draft on
this deposite will be equivalent to the
specie in St. Louis, and eagerly desired.
This simple illustration throws light on the
whole stbject; in early times, when there
were neither banks nor brokers, it might
have been necessary to put up &Nationual
Institution, but a check or drt of the
Secretary of the Treasury, wherever it
may now go, will purchase the best cur
rency, and bo sufficient to pay the debts
of the Government.
A paper circulation, common to the
who le iuntry, has been much landed. and
is certainly useful to the travelling com
nanity. It is said that if a person starter
at New Orleans and went to Boston, half
of his expenses might be charged to hro
kerage; but the taking of a small quantity
ofspecie would remedy this evil, cret if
we were disposed to compare the tentpo
rary conveuienice of a few travellers, to the
permanent interests of the thousands who
never leave their own State. The local
Banks, if properly managed, canl alwavr
furnish exchange at a mod erate premium.
The relative business of the diflerent see
tions of the country. is the basis of this
operation; if Newhern buys more than it
sells. exchange will be against Newbern,
and if it sells more than it huys. exchange
will be in its favor. and this is the univer
sal lw under every system of finance -
l)uriting the late crisis, exchange at New
Orle-ans on New York was 10 per cent.
above par, while in North Carolina. a
draft could be obtained at 1 per cent.; the
reawmti was, that New Orleans was heavily
indebted to New York, whilst the mer
chants ofour own State bad been doing a
snug and prudent business. The Bank of
England has no branch at Dublin or Edin
burg, yet the merchants of that Kingdom
do not complain of the derangensent of
exchanges; there is no hank to regulate the
commercial intercotrse between N. York
and Liverpool, and there is no justifiable
cause why the business of our own cities
should inot be on a footing equally favora
ble. In the brcaking up of an old system,
and the commencement- of another, there
will be some distress and confusion. but in
a short time the business of the country
will become adapted to the new state of
things, and the predicted evils will not
appear.
The chief argument. however, in favor
of a National Bank, i is its supposed ability
to carry on a sound currency. The pre
cedent of 1816, when Mrgl adison gave ttp
his objections and signed the hill for the
establishment of the late Institution, is fre
quently referred to. and at one time it had
great weight in my owt mind. But a
more minute acquaintance with the history
of banking, and a more soearching investi
gation of uts tendencies, have shaken my
faith in the soundness of this opinion..
The General Assembly grants a ch arter
of incorporation, aad if tmoneyed men are
pleased with its provisions, they subscribe
for stock, and the bank begins its opera
tions. The object of the Legislature is to
furnish a paper currency to the people,
that of the capitalist,to make a good invest
ment for himself. Prudent, and keen
sighted, looking to his own interests, he
mmnages he bank to make money for the
stockholders. The greater the issue of
paper, the larger will be the dividends,
and the higher the stock will rise in the
market; thus for a time, even an honest
man wvill be tempted to go lieyond the
bounds of prudence, and throw out more
currency than is wanted. When to this is
adtded the eagerness of borrowers, the re
sult of the whole aflfair is easily percepti
ble. Though young in years, the country
is already in the old age or luxury atnd re
finement. Hlatits of industry and econo
tny are distasteful to many-of our people.
The-y wish to substitute speculation for
patient labor,and they are greedy of riches;
they indulge in expensive pleasures. A
temporary combination takes place be
tween the banker and the borrower, every
thing rises in price; the rich man thinks
himnself a prince the poor one acts as if
he had woetlth, and all go on rejoicing un
til the bubble is swollen to its utmost ex
tent, and the puncture of a pin brings it to
the earth. .' he Bank cannot redeem its
paper, because its debtors cannot pay, for
prices and property are in an artificial stite;
the ktowing capitalist took advantage of
some one's ignorance to sell his stock at
a high advance, and leaves the institution
to tie odium, which his own conduct bro't
against it.
Any bank oflarge capital,properly man
aged, would certainly check the State cor
porations, and keep them within reasona
ble lirmits. But there is no kuaranty that
a National Institution would he governed
with more virtue and wisdom than the
State Banks; men of the same character
are stockholders of each. desirous of large
dividends, and the debtors of one are as
littlelikely to be circumspect as those of
the other. The same vice iufects the
wiholsystem, and where there is an appa
rent difference between the federal and lo
eal banks, it is caused by peculiar circum
stances. Ifin 1816, the Legislatures had
compelled the State corporations to per
form their contracts or the General Gov
ernment had demanded specie in the pay
mew of its dues, there would have ceo
no necessity for a National Bank; if the
makers and guardians of the law would
extetd to banks the same penalties, which
befal insolvent individuals, we should not
often hear of the suspension of specie pay
ments. That this is the true remedy, late
events incontestably prove. The banks
of New York would have forfeited their
charters, if resumption had not taken
place on or before the 1st May. and this
did happen not only without a National
Bank, but in spite of the Mammoth In
stitution at Philadelpbia. I have no
affinity with those who wish to persecute
moneyed institutions, for there are times
when the wisest cannot foresee the revul
sions in trade and commierce, and should
not be blamed: I only lay down a general
princtpl., applicable to ordinary cases, by
which the people can be protected, and
the i anks be made to know their duty.
But if a National Batik can confer these
boasted blessings on the people, it must lie
invested with vast power and extensive
privileges. The President of the late In
stitution, when asked by a committee of
the Senate "las the Bank at any time op
pressed any of the Stat- Bank-;" answer
ed "No, iever-but there are very few
hanks that imight not have been destroved
by an exertion of the power of the Bank."
it thus seems that t welve individtals would
cintrol the woneyed interests of this great
iduntry. If they were favorable to a State
Wilk it might issue bills to any amoun
and make large dividends for its stockhol
tiers; if they were lostile, it might shut its
doors, and close its business, without re
ga-.ito the power which brought it into
exmience, Whatever might be the in
idrests of the people among whom it was
located, or the oliject of the Legislature
which granted the charter, the local bank
must look to the views antd feelings of the
distant master, on whose smiles and frm ns
its fate would hang. This powerful i flu
ence would not be confined to the capital
ists and their imimnediate dependants ; the
industrious classes, the merchant, main
Saaturer, agriculturist, and al who were in
need of loans and credit for successful op.
erations, would have a direct interest in
propitiating the great Molorh of monev.
W hen we think of the rage for riches which
characterises the present generation, and
the inordinate desire for time luxuries of
life, it is not unreasonable to suppose that
the power, which is believed to dispense
these favors, would be almost irresistalble.
When Mr. Van Buren was inaugurnied
he declared himself the uncompromising
oppon. nt of Abolition. At the com
meucement of the 3d jessionof the 25th
.ongress, it was thought prudent to stifle
the petitions anti memoriuls on this sub
ject, and Mr. Patton, of Virginia, intro
duced a resolution, ordering them to be
laid on the taLle without further action
thereon :seventy-four members of the
House of Representatives voted against
this resolution of whbom nine or teni were
suipporters of the Admlministramtionm, andi thme
rest werme its opponenits, not a single 'WVhig'
froum the North vomimng ini the affirmative.
0On tihe 12th of Decemiber, 1838, Mr. Ath
erton, of.New Hampshire, presented to
our body certain resolutionis on the sub
ject of thme powers of time Genmeral Govern
ment, and for tihe purpose of disposing of
the "Abolition papers," with wvhich the
House was to be flooded: they afirm the
control of the States over their domestic
institutions, and rebuke ini a proper spirit
tme agitators, who wish to use this Govern
miet as a lever to effect their designs on
the Southern country. Seventy-eight
mnembiers voted against the last clause of
the last resolution, ordering the petitionis
amid metmorials of the fanatics to be laid onm
the table, "without b'eing printed, read, or
referred ;" of these nine or ten were "Dem
ocrats," and 'the rest were "Whigs," not
a single opponent of Mr. Van B uren, from
time North, voting in the affirmative.
The Abolitionists and their friends were
deeply offended at the passage of these
resolutions: those who voted for them
were stigmnatised in the vilest language,
and denounced as the puppets of slave
holders, whilst they. who voted against
them., were heralded, through the North as
the friends of liberty amid free discussion.
I am far from saying that all the North
ern Whiigs are favorable to thme schemnes
of this misguided .people ; but Mr. Van.
Buren having early taken ground against
them, and 'his friends in Congress having
voted with the Sonihern delegation, there
by incurring the hatred of the fanatics,
whilst the Whigs have received their
thanks and praises, it.is not unreasonable
to conclude that- one party is much soundl
er than the other. *J however, only state
the, facts; it becomes you to make the cow
ment in justice and charity.
But we must not put too much faith in
parties and politicians. I have seen enough
to make ine distrust those who are strug
Aling for p9wer and office. We must ad
here to our principles; we must keep aloof
from those contests, whose result is to ele
vate men and divide the spoils of victory.
If the slave-holding States be true to them
selves, they can give law to the Govern
ment; but if our public men be divided in
to factions, and permit the great doctrines
of the Constitution to be sunk into a mere
scramble for the 'loaves and fishes." our
influence will be lost, and our property
will be sacrificed.
The preceding remarks unfold my po
litical principlcs. and indicate the courae,
ihat I shall pursue on the bill for the es
tablishinent of the "Inidependent Treasu
ry." it it contains those safeguards, which
I deem essential to permnaneut success.
Under its provisions, Executive patronage
will be less than if the Government were
leagued with the banks: its tendency is to
diminish the public expenditures-to piu
rily the currency, and to render unneces
sary that paper monopoly,.so alien to the
genius,of our insitutions, and so fatal to
the interets of the Southern States.
The length of this communication, pre
vents me from entering nore fully into the
merits of the great doctrine of the separa
tion of Bank and State; its novelty and the
clamor that was raised for political effect,
induced many excellent men to question
its expediency, lbut contrary to precon
ceived notions. I feel compelled to give it
my support, and shall take another oppor
tunity of stating the reasons.
Your obedient servant,
CHAItLES SHEPARD.
WAsmyo'roy, Dec. 20h, 1S38.
Ohio Legislature.-Mr. Flood offered
the folluwing preamble and resolutions to
the House of Representatives, Saturday.
Jan. 15th.
"Resolved, by the General Assembly of
the State of Ohio. That in the opiion of
this General assembly, ours is a Govern
ment of limited powers; that all powers
not delegated by the Constitution are re
served to the People; and that by the
Constitution o the United States, Con
gress has no jurisdiction over the institu
tions of slave.-y in the several States of this
Confederacy.
"Resolved, That the agitation of the
subject of slavery in the nois-'lave holding
States, is, in the opinion of this General
Assembly, attended with no good; that the
atielioration of slaves is not enhanced;
and that it is a violation of the faith which
ought ever to -exist among states of the
same coufederacy.
"Resolved, That the sche-!mes of the
Atiolinonists, 1or the pretended happiness
of the slaves, are, in the opinion of this
General Assetmbly, niild, delusive and fa
natical; and have a direct tendency to de
stroy the hiarmony of the Union, to rivet
tihe chain of the slaves, and to destroy the
perpetuity of our free institutions.
"Resolved, Thar all attempts to abolsh
slavery in the States of this Union, or to
prohibit the removal of slaves from State
to State, or to discriminate between the
instititions of one portion of the country
and another, with the views aforesaid,are,
in the opinion of Ihis General Astembly,
in ''violation of the Constitution of the
United States, and destructive of the fun
damental principles on which rests the
union of these States."
"Resolved, That in the opinion of this
General Assembly. it is unwise, impolitic
and inexpedient, to repeal any law in
force, imposing disabilities upon black and
mulatto persons, thus placind them on an
equality with the whites, so far as the
Legislature can do, and indirectly itnvi
ting the black population of other States
to emigrate to this State, to the manifest
injury of the public interest.
"Resolved TPhat the Governor be reques
ted to forward copies of these resolutions
to the President and Vice-President of the
United States to eaich of our Senators in
Congress, and to the. Executive of ever
State in the Conf'ederacv."cr
The Mercants.-During the debate on
the Swartwot Defalcatins, Mr. Hioflinana
saidI, it had of late become the practice in
every way, and on all occasions, to assail
the character of our Merchants, who seem
ed to lhe regarded by some as a caravan
'in the desert, that every wandering
tribe might thitnk it fair to attack and plun
der. But who are the merchants of this
country? They weremen whose honor
and enterprise hatve done as much to ele
vate our national character as the gallant
achievements of our army and navy; and
whose integrity and faith, duritng our late
financial difficulties, had called forth on
the floor of the British Parliament, a trib
ute of praise from the Chancellor of the
Exchequer-men who had left less than
?500 unpaid,outof more than $2,00)0,000,
wiuich had been returned upon them pro
tested from Etngland. Where did their ene
mies find motiveq lor this perpetual at
tack? Was it to be found in present excr
tions, or their past history? Was it to he
fohud in that spirit of enterprise which
had carried our flag to every sea and eve
ry clime, atnd had paid into our very
Treasury the sums which had formed this
alimnent to speculation and defalcation?
Was it to be found in the early h.itory of
our Republic? Are not gentlemen admon
ished of its injustice, by that picture which
adorns your Rotunda, when they see .and
.know, that lie who is there sitting .n his
chair of dignity and peril, receiving. 'he
Declaration of our Independence from a
