paying the doctor.
After a day 6f unusual anxiety and fa
tigue, Dr. JClton found himself snugl;
wrapped up in a liberal quantity of blan
kets and bed quilts, just as the clod
struck twelve one stormy night in Febru
ary. For'over half an hour he had laii
awake racking his brain in reference t
two or three critical cases which were oi
his hands; but tired nature could keep u;
no longer, apd the sweet oblivion of slee]
was stealing over.his senses. But just a
he had lost himself, the bell over his hea<
began to ring furiously, and brought hin
into thepaiddle of the floor in an instant
Pushing his head out of the window, h<
interrogated the messenger below, just to<
late tosape that individual the trouble o
giving the bell-rope another violent de
monstrtktion of his skill.
uMr. Marvel wants you to ccme anc
see Charley immediately," replied the
messenger.

"He's got the croup,*! believe."
_<4TelI jrim I'll be there in a moment,'
said Dr. Elton, drawing in his head. Hur
rying on his clothes, "he descended to his
office, and possessing himself ofsome n?cessnry
medicines, ifbefng tod late for the
family'ttifeMtaut a prescription, wrapped
his cloak^afdudd hiin, and turned outnjtc
the storm.
It was at least half a mile to the residence
jpJLjfr. Marvel, and by the time the
Doctor arrived there, he was Cold, wet,
and iwmmfnrtahlA, both in mind a nd
body. Ascending the chamber, he was
not a Utt[e4 surprised. to find Charley, a
bright little fellow of sor.ie two years old,
sitting.u# Itvhis crib as lively as a cricket.
s *.. i
"O Dbctori fre've been so frightened!'
said MrS.: Marvel, as Dr. Klton entered.?
<4Wc thought Charley had the croup, he
breath^d.so Ibu'd.. ..But he don't seem tc
fet any worse. What do think of him,
loctoiT
Dr. Elton felt~his puhse, listened to his
resDirrftion. examined the appearance ol
his skirt, and then sail emphatically.
"I think you'd better all be in bed!"
"It's better to be scared than hurt, Doc
tor," responded Mr. Marvel.
"Htinoph!" ejaculated Dr Elton.
"Dont you think you!d better give hirr
something, Doctor?"said Mrs. Marvel.
"What for, ma'am?"
"To keep him from having the croup,
Don't you think he's threatened with it?'
"Not half as much as 1 am," replied the
Doctor, who made a quick retreat, fearing
that he should give way too much to hh
irritated feelings, and offend a family whr
were able to pay. *
Next morning, on the debtor side of his
ledger, under the name of Mr. Marvel,
Dr. Elton made this entry: To oiu
nights visit to son, 85. "And it's well foi
me that he's able to pay it," added th<
Doctor, mentally, as he replaced the boo!
in the drawer from which he had taken it
Scarcely had this necessary part of the
business been performed, when the sanu
messenger who had summoned him the
night before, came post haste into the of
fice, with the announcement that Mrs,
Marvel wanted him to come, there immediately,
as Charley had got a high fever.
Obedient to the summons, Dr. Elton
soon made his appearance, and found
both Mr. and Mrs. Marvel greatly concerned
about their little bov.
" I'm so 'fraid of the scarlet fever, Doctor?"
said Mrs. Marvel. " Do you thinl
it's any thing like that ?" she continuec
with much anxiety, turning u{x>n Charle\
a look of deep maternal affection.
Dr. Elton felt of Charley's pulse anc
looked at his tongue, and then wrote i
prescription in silence.
"What do you think of him, Doctor?'
asked the father much concerned.
"He's not dangerous, sir. Give him
this and it he should grow worse, send foi
JX16*
The Doctor bowed and departed, ane
the fond paKebts sent off for the medicine.
It was in the form of a very small dose o!
rhubarb, and poor Charley had to have his
nose held tight, and the nauseous stutl
poured down his throat. In the afternoor
when tjjuq, doctor called, on being sent for
there were some slight febrile symptoms
consequent.upon excitement and loss ol
rest. The medicine, contrary to his expectation,'
heightened, instead of allaying
these; and long tiefore night-fall lie was
fe ummoned again lo attend his little patient.
Much to hi? surprise, he found him
with a hot skin, flushed face, and quick
t j encd pulse. Mrs. MaFvel was in a state \ d
J ol terrible alarm.' t!
' "I knew there was more the matter with p
*r j him than you thought for, Doctor!'* said .
'e ( the mother, while Dr.- Elton examined his | f
{patient. "You thought rt was nothing!
j but I knew lietteri -If you'd only pre-!
; scribed last night as I wanted you to, all i
this might have been saved." * " |.
- "Dont be alarmed, madam," said the ' j
h Doctor, "there is nothing serious in this i
f fever. -It will soon subside." |
Mrs. Marvel shook her head. .[ t
e "Its the scarlet fever, Doctor, I know it , 1
o is!" she said, passionately, and bursting j 1
n into tears. i 1
f "Let mclteg of you, madam, not to dis- L
- tress yourself. I assure you there is no f e
y danger!" t
s "So you said last night, Doctor; and
s just see how much worse he is getting!5'
s As Dr. Elton was generally a man of g
%- few words, he said no iiiore, but wrote, a j
e prescription, and went away, promising, J t
?f however, at the earnest request of Mrs. 1
Marvel, to call again that night. s. t
a About nine o'clock he called in again,
h and found Charley's fever in no degree ]
i- abated, .Mrs. Marvel was in tears, and i
i. her husband was pacing the lloor in a state
- of great uneasiness. I
h '-O, Doctor, he'll die, I'm sure he'll die!"" ..
said Mrs. Marvel weeping bitterly.
."Don't be alarmed, my dear madam," j
.? replied the Doctor. "I assure you it is 1
t nothincr serious." j 1
?
"0, I'm sure it's the scarlet fever! It's j
all about now."
Y' '/'No madam, I am in earnest when J ;
* tell you it is nothing of the kind. Histhroat ;
^ is not in the least sore. f t
"Yes, Doctor, it is sore!"
n "How do you know?" responded the
0 Doctor, examining Charley's mouth and
1 throat, which showed not the least svmp- J
P torn of any .irritation of the mucous mem- !
P hrane. "It can't be sore from any seri-I
s ous cause. Some trilling swelling of the | r
^ glands is all that can occasion it, if any
1 exists."
Thus assured, and in a positive manner,
3 1 Airs. Marvels alarm in some degree aba
31 ted, and after ordering a warm bath, tho
^ j Doctor retired. it
About three o'clock the Doctor was | t
again sent for in great baste. On enter- I
ing the chamber of his little patient, he n
! found his fever all gone, and he in a pleasant
sleep. p
"What do you think of him, Doctor?" t<
f | asked Mrs. Marvel, in a low, anxious v
I whisper.
* j "I think he is doing as well as he can." : y
1 "Butaint if strange, DoCfcr,'"that he;
should breathe so low ? He looks so pale, a
' and lays so quiet ? Arc you sure he's not f \
' dying?"
' "Dying!" exclaimed Dr. Clton,?"he's ! i;
uo more dying than you . are! Really,*|
Mrs. Marvel, you torture yourself with li
1 unnecessary fears! Nature is only a lit- J
? tie exhausted from struggling with the fe- | \
' vcr, he w ill be like n new person by morn- , ]
'ing."
1 "Do not mistake the case, Doctor, for !
1 we are very much concerned," said Mr. j h
Marvel. ' . . . " j b
"I do assure you, sir, that I understand : d
the case precisely; and you must believe
me, when I tell you that no patient was 1 \
1 ever in a better wav than your little boy."
* ^
Next morning, among other charges ii
f made by Dr. Elton, were two against Mr. i
Marvel as follows: To four visits to son, f
' 84. To one night visit to son, S3.
"Not a bad customer!" said the Doctor, j s
with a smile as he ran up the whole ac- j
count, and then closed the book. ] n
In the constant habit of sending for the !
Doctor, on every trifling occasion, wheth- | ii
cr it occurred at noonday or midnight, it ,
1 j is not to be wondered at that n pretty large !
bill should find its way to 31r. iviarvti ai i r
' the end of the year. And this was not the i 1;
; worst of it; the health of his whole family j n
suffered in no slight degree from the fact ! .
!! of each individual being so frequently un- e
>r j der the influence ofmedicine. Poor Char- a
} I ley was victimized almost every week; | y
* j and instead of being a fresh hearty boy, | y
I began to show a pale thin face and every 1 j
i I indication of a weakened vital action.? ; h
' | This appearance only increased the evil, , f
' j for both parents, growing more anxious in j
' consequence/were more urgent to have ,
5 j him placed under treatment. Dr. Elton j t
: i sometimes remonstrated with them, but to r
no purpose; and yielding to their ignorance }
} and their anxiety, became a party in the j <j
J destruction of the boy's health.
"What is that my dear?" asked Mrs. f r
' Marvel of her husband, some ten months }
' after their introduction to the reader, as s
the latter regarded with no pleasant coun- !
tenance, a small piece of paper which he : }
1 held in his hand. r
1 "Why, it's Dr. Elton's bill."
"Indeed! How much is it?" t
"One hundred and fifty dollars!" e
"O, husband!" I h
k "Did you ever hear of such a thing!" jv
"One hundred and fifty dollars did you ;
say?" ;r
"Yes, one hundred and fifty dollars! j
' Aint it outrageous?" tfc
1 "It's scanda!ous! It's downright swind- i
^ ling! I'd never pay it in the world! Who i
ever heard of such a thing! One hundred ;
and fifty dollars for one years attendance! j b
1 Good gracious!"?and Mrs. Marvel held i t
up her hands, and lifted her eyes in pro- v,
found astonishment. | f
"I can't understand it!"said Mr. Mar. j
vol. "Why, no body's had a spell of sick- ; i
ness in the family for the whole year.? j

1 "Good morning, Mr. Marvel! Ifow do tl
you do to-day !" said the Doctor, who un j
ecstood, from his countenance that somehing
was wrong, and had an instinctive
perception of its. nature.
"Cood morning, Doctor! I got your bill
o-dav."
"Yes, sifj I sent it out,"
"But aint there something wrong about
t, Doctor?" ' - *
"No, I presume not. I make my char,
jes carefully, and draw off my bills in exict
accordance with them."
. "But there must be, Doctor. How in
he world could you make a bill of one
mndred and fifty dollars against me??
['ve had no serious sickness in my famiy."
.
"And yet, Mr. Marvel, I have been called
in almost every week, and sometimes
hrec or four times, in as many days."
"Impossible!"
"I'll shew you my ledger if that will |
;atisfy you where every visit is entered." j
: VNo, it's no use to do that. I hnow
hat you have been called in pretty often,
>ut not frequent enough to make a bill like
his." ; .
fallow many night visits do you suppose j
[ have made to your family during tho
pear?"
"I'm sure I don't know. Not more th$n
hrec or four.?
"I've made ten!"
"You must be mistaken, Doctor."
"Do,you remember that I was called in
ast, February, when you thought Charley
iad the coup!"
".Yes."
" And the night after?"
" Yes. That's but two."
' And the "night you thought he had
he measles ?"
"Yes."
"And the night after?"
" Yes." But that's only four."
" A nd the three times he fell out ofbcd ?
. "Not three times, Doctor ?"
" Yes, it was three times. Don't you
ecollect the knob on his head ?"
" Yes, indeed !"
" And the sprained finger."
" "Yos."
"And the bruised check."
" Well, I believe you. are right about
hat, Doctor. But that don't make ten
imes."
" Yoii have not forgotten, of coarse, the
light he told you he had swallowed a pin ?"
" No, indeed," said the father turning
ale. " Do you think there is any danger
o be apprehended from its working its
ray into the heart, Doctor."
"None at all, I should think.. And
ou remember?"
"Never mind, Doctor, I suppose you
re right about that. But how can ten
isits make one hundred,and fifty dollars?"
" They will make fitly, though, and that
s one third of the bill."
" Yau don't pretend to charge five dolars
a visit, though, Doctor."
*' For all visits after ten o'clock at night,
vc arc allowed by law to charge five dolars."
" Outrageous!"?
" Would vou cct up out of your warm
od after midnight, turn out in a Decern?er
storm, and walk half a mile for five
lollars ?
" I can't say that I won'd. But then it's
our business."
" Of course it is, and I must be paid for
t." '
" Any how, Doctor, that don't account
or the whole of this exorbitant bill."
"But one hundred day and evening viits
here on my ledger, will, though."
" You don't pretend to say you have paid
ny family a hundred visits, certainly ?"
" I will give you day and date for them,
f necessary."
"No, it's no use to do that," said Mr.
ilarvel, whose memory began to be a little
nore active. " I'll give you a hundred dolirs,
and say no more about it; that is elough
in all conscience."
" I can't do any such thing, Mr. Marvl.
I have charged you what was right,
nd can take nothing otf. What would
ou think of a man who had made a bill at
our store of one hundred and fifty dollars,
f he were to offer you one hundred when
ic came to pay, and ask for a receipt in
ull?
" But that aint to the point."
"Aintit, though? I should like to
icar of a case more applicable. But it's
10 use to multiply words about the matter.
' ill-l . t I *?i,? n
I V Dili is correct, uiiu a uaiuiui vcnw ?

44 It's the last bill you ever make rut of
no, remember, that, Doctor ?" said Mr.
darvel, rising, and leaving the office in a
late of angry excitement."
44 Well, what does he say ?" asked Mrt.
ilarvcl, who had waited for her husband's
eturn with some interest.
44 Why, he tried to beat me down that
he bill was all right; but I'm too old a
hild for that. Why. would you believe it?
ie has charged five dollars for every night
isit." .
" Well, that's no better than highway '
obbery."
" Not a bit. But it's the last money
ic ev.er gets out of me.
"I'dnever call him in, I know. He
nust think we're made of money-"
44 O, I supj>ose we're the first family
ic's had who was'nt poor, and he wanted
o dig as deep as possible. I hate such
windling. and if it w as'nt for having a
? 1 11 M
uss, 1 d never pay him a aonar,
" He's charged us for every poor family
;i the neighborhood, I suppose."
" No doubt of it. I've heard of these
ricks before ; but it's the last time I'll subnit
to have them played off upon me."
The visit of Mr. Marvel somewhat dis:omposcd
of the feelings of Dr. Elton, and
le had begun to moralize upon the unhankful
position he held in the communiwhen
he was aroused from his reverie
y the entrance of a servant from one of
he principal .hotels, with a summons to ateod
immediately a "young lady who: was
hought to be exceedingly ill.
Who is she!" asked the Doctor.
" She is the daughter of Mr. Smith, a
merchant from the east." si
" 19 any one with her ?" h
" Yes, her father."
u Tell him I will be there immediately." tc
In the course of fifteen minutes Dr. ii
Elton's carriage drove up to the door of a
the hotel. He found his patient to be a t<
yonng lady of about seventeen, accompa- a
nicd by her father, a middle aged man,
whose feelings were much, and anxiously tl
excited. At a glance, his practised eye c
detected symptoms of a serious nature, and j a
a closer examination of the case convin-1 h
ced him that all his skill would be called I
into requisition. With a hot, dry skin, fi
slightly flushed face, parched lips, and sli- b
my furred tongue, there was a dejection,
langour, and slight indication of delirium g
?and much apparent confusion of mind, d
Prescribing as he thought the case required,
he left the room, accompanied with
tie father. y
" Well, Doctor, what do you think of [
hsr ?" said Mr. Smith, with a heavy, oppressed
expiration.
I " She is ill, sir, and will require atten- v
|.i?>p." f
" But, Doctor, you don't think my child y
^hngerous, do you ?" said the father with 0
an alarmed manner.
"It is right that you should know, sir, p
that your daughter is, to all appearance, c
threatened with the typhus fever. But I e
don't think there in any cause far alarm,
' 4 ? rkVirroir?ian and a
oniy ior great care in nci attendants."
1'
" O, Doctor, can I trust her in your t
hands ? But I am foolish ; I know that c
there is no one in this city of more acknowledged
skill than yourself. You must a
pardon a father's fears. Spare no atten- g
lions, Doctor?visit her at least twice eve- a
ry day, and you shall be well paid for your
attentions. Save my child for mo, and I I
will owe you eternal gratitude." c
44 AH that I can do for her, shall be done, a
[ sir," said Dr. Elton. r
Just relieved from the care of a dangerous
case, in its healthy change, Dr. Elton's t
mind had relaxed from the anxiety which t
too frequently burdned it; for a physic- j
lan's mind is always oppressed while the s
' issue of life or death npon his power to t
Subdue a disease, which may be too deeply (
seated to yield to the influence of medi- i
inc. Now, all the oppressive sense of re- I
, sponsibility, the care, the anxiety, were to 1
be renewed, and felt,with the even a keen- t
' er concern. 1
In the evening he called in, but there s
was no perceptible change, except a slight 1
aggravation of all the symptoms. The j
medicine had produced no visible salutary i
effect. During the second day, there was i
o '
exhibited little alteration, but on the morn- <
ng of the third day symtoms of a more i
decided character supervened?such as <
saffused and injected eyes, painful deglu- I
tion, an oppresion in the chest accompan- I
ied with a short dry cough, pains in the j
back, loins, andxtremities, aud a soreness <
througnout tnc wbole body.. These had <
not escaped father's the observation, and
and with the most painful anxiety i
I did he watch the countenance of the phy- i
! sician while he examined the case in its <
new presentation. Much as he tried to ?
control the expression of his face, he found j
| it impossible, He felt too deeply conccr- ,
| ncd, and was too conscious of the frequent j i
! impotence of medicine, when administered 11
with the most experienced skill.
In the afternoon he called again, and i
found the father, as useal, by th be-dside (
Ilis patient seemed to be in a narcotic
sleep andwljenroused oin it, frcomplained
nmch giddiness, and soon sunk down again !
into a state of torpor. i
" What do you think of her now, Doc- i
tor V' asked the father, in a horse whisper, j
[ on the physician's leaving the chamber of 1
his patient. i
" It is impossible to form any correct i- 1
j dea respecting a case like this. I have <
( seen many much worse recover, and have I
! no doubt, as far as human calculation will s
go, that your daughter will get well. But i
the fever is a tedious one, usually defying i
all attempts at breaking it. It must run i
its course, which is usually some ten or fif- 1
teen days. All we can do is to palliate, '
and then assist nature, when the disease '
has abated its violence."
It is not necessary to trace the progress i'
of the disease from day to day, until it | i
j reached its climax. When the fever did ! j
i break, and a soft, gentle moisture penetrat- j j
i od the skin, the uatienthad but a spark of ! i

life remaining. But, as Dr. Elton, in his s
judicious treatment, had not resorted to >
venesection, nor to any powerful exhibit- J
ions of medicine, nature had only to react
against the disease, and not against the <
paralysing effects of medicines ; and slow- i
ly but surely did she begin to recover. Al- j
together to the skilful treatment of Dr. : I
Elton, as a human agent,did the patient j I
owe her recovery. A less cautious phy- j i
sician, by a single mistake, would have :
brought all to a fatal end. <
At the close of the fifteenth day, when ,
every symptom indicated that convales- i
cence or death would soon ensue, no one i
but a physician can imagine the painful, j
restless anxiety, which was felt by Dr. j
| Elton. He took but little food, and slept i
hardly any during the-whole night, Ire- <
qucntly starting from his brief periods of
troubled slumber, in consequence of great i
nervous excitement. i
Early in the morning he called at the i
room of his patient, trembling, least a first i
glance should dash every hope to the ]
| ground- He entered softly, and perceived
| the father bending over her with a pale <
! anxious face. She was asleep. He took i
her hand, but let it drop instantly.
44 What is the matter ?" asked the father
in an alarmed whisper, his face growing
paler.
44 She is safe !" responded the Doctor in I
| a low whisper, every pulse thrilling with ;
| pleas'unt excitement. i
The father elapsed his hands, looked up- I
! wards a moment, and then burst into | 1
tears. j'
1* '*
"How can I ever repay you for your gn
till in saving my child!-" he said, after fas
is feeling had grown calmer. wli
It was nearly a month before the daugh- inj
;r was well enough to return home, dur- th<
ig most of which time Dr. Elton was in ne
ttendance. For fifteen days he had at- tic
md twice a day regularly, and for nearly
s long a period once a day. hh
While sitting in his office one day about th
iree o'clock, waiting for his carriage to hii
oine up to the door, Mr. Smith entered, T1
nd asked for his bill, as he was about to m;
jave. On examining his account book, sh
)r. Elton found that he had more about /?
fty visits, and accordingly he made out his ly
ill fifty dollars. Hi
" How much is this, Doctor ?" said Mr. of
Imith, eyeing the bill with something f al
loubt in the expression of his countenance, isi
" Fifty dollars, sir."
" Fifty dollars! Why surely, Doctor, ^
du are not going to take advantage of rae at
n that way ?" to
" I don't understand you sir."
" Why, I never heard of such an extraagant
bill in my life. I have my whole ?
amily attended at home for fifty dollars a
car, and you have not been visiting one s
?f them much over a month."
" Such as the bill is, you will have to ay
it, sir. It is just, and I shall not abate
?ne dollar," responded Dr. Elton, consid- *"
rably irritated.
Mr. Smith drew out his pocket-book ^
lowly, selected a fifty dollar bill from a P<
arge package, handed it to the Doctor,
ook his receipt, and rising tojhis feet, said ai
emphatically? si
"lama stranger, and you have taken st
dvantage of me. But, remember the of
rains of dishonesty will never prosper!" 0f
md turning upon his heel, left the office, u
"Who would be a doctor?" muttered ^
)r. Elton, forcing the unpleasant thoughts
ccasioned by the incident from his mind, ?
md endeavouring to fix it upon a case of
nore than usual interest.
a fkn wicp i? sufflp.innt: it is l
A 1TWIU IU IIIVI mvw 7 ,
herefore needless to multiply scenes illus- ^
rativc of tho manner in which too many .
>eople pay the doctor. When any one is l!
tick, the doctor is sent for, and the family Si
ire all impatient until he arrives, If the c<
lase is a bad one, he is looked upon as a ^
ninistericg angel; the patient's eye brigh- ,r
ens when he comes, and all in the house ti
'eel more cheerful for hours after. Amid g
ill inclemencies of the weather, at all j ai
lours in the day or night, he obeys, the | w
mmmons, and brings all his skill, acquired 0
jy long study, and by much laborious c
iractice, to boor upon the disease. But! a
ivhen the sick person gets well, the doctor! s
is forgotten ; and when his bill appears ^
complaint at its amount is almost always:*
made, and too frequently, unless he pro- i
ceed to legal measures, it is entirely with- n
held from him. These things ought not so a
tebe. Of course, there are many honour. 8
able exceptions ; but every physician can
exclaim?" Would that their number was h
^raeter." r
Some persons who are ready to send for, o
the doctor, on even* trifling occasion, seem v
to forget, that every time this individual is t.
called in he makes a charge. Others are ?
strangely oblivious in reference to the p
number of visits made, and when in the
course of a year, the doctor has been summoned
some forty or fifty times, will contend
that he has not been in the house ten
times during the whole twelve months. 0
But, as just said?a word to the wise is (
sufficient, and so we drop the subject. j
Cloth-Binding.?Nothing places in j
so striking a point of view the superior 1
taste, judgment, and resources of London
tradesmen over those of the rest of the
world, than the extensive substitution ;
which they have recently made of embos- |
sed silks and calicoes for leather in the r
binding of books. In old libraries, ciotn- f
covered boards indeed may occasionally ^
be seen but they have the meanest aspect,
and are no more to be compared with our
modern cloth-binding, than thejrrjton of a
trull, with the ballet dress of Taglioni. The 1
silk or calico may be dyed of any shade *
which use or fancy may require, impressed *
with gold or silver foil iu every form, and j (
variegated by ornaments in relief, copied j 1
from the most beautiful production in nature.
This new style of binding is dist- t
inguished not more for its durability, cle- t
?ance, and variety, than for the economy f
and despatch with which it ushers the offspring
of intellect into the world. For example,
should a house eminent in this line,
such as that of Westlcys, Friar-street, '
Doctors' commons, receive 5000 volumes, ,
from Messrs. Longman & Co. upon Monday
morning, they can have them all ready j 1
for oublication, within the incredibly short |
fieriod of two days; being far sooner than 1
they could have rudely boarded them upon c
the former plan. The reduction of price, Jl
is not the least advantage incident to the t
new method, amounting to fully 50 per 1
cent, upon that with leather. t
The dyed cloth being cut by a pattern 1
to the size suited to the volume, is passed
rapidly through a roller press, between, en-. ^
graved cylinders of hard steel whereby it a
receives at once the impress characters- y
tic of the back, and the sides, along with ^
embossed designs over the surface in sharp ^
relief. The cover thus rapidly fashioned,
is as rapidly applied by paste to the stiched
and pressed volume ; ro time being lost in
mutual adjustments ; since the steel rob *
lers turn off the former, of a shape precise- 1
ly adapted to the latter. Ilard glazed and
L 1 1
varnished calico is moreover mucn icssan '
object of depredation to moths, and other v
insects, than ordinary leather has been
found to be. ]
Opposition Grog Shops con fuse a man's |
Policies.?A friend, in describing a scene
he witnessed in the street not lon^ since,
, g
gave us a very forcible illustration of the
importance of not mixing liquors in a po? 0
litical contest. In passing up Main street,
ie saw a man in a state of great dubiety ^
n to the where abouts of his c>n'r^ of,"
i vity and who found it necessary to keep w
it hold of his cart to steady tmnseif, - *

jr doubtless political eye-slave, which,
>ugh it inflames the eyes, gives a ?m
vertheless a wonderfully clear percep- .
>n of the merits of candidates.
After working, at his jug-for some time,
j began to ferment, and grasping the
e cajt with renewed energy, he raised
3 head and shouted hurrah for Harrison!
ien looking down and poundering the
itter a little, he raised his head and
outed, hurrah for Van s (a^ause)
r Van Buren ! The fellow was evident,
confused as to which side Ire belonged,
e had probably been at the Grog Shops
both parties, which confused his politic,
creed ; and though brim-full of patriot.

The Pennsylvania hanks are required
j a law of the state to resume specie
lyments in January, and are expected to
> so. Our neighbors of North Carolina >
ad Georgia will probably be able to reime
soon after. If the public could wish
ronger evidence' than they always had,
'the cautious and judicious management
' the banks in the interior of this state*
icy have it in the fact that they were able
) continue specie payments during So
sneral a suspension at the South.

Silk.?We had the pleasure a few days
nee of seeing several pounds of most . . autiful
sewing silk made by Mrs. Spapn*
f Sumter District, the past season. She .
1 formed us that she made 251b. of the
ime quality, besides floss, pierced colons
&c. It was well reeled and well .
visted, which was done by a negro wolan
from the cotton field, without instrucon
except what Mrs. Spann herself
ave from l>ooks and periodicals, such as
re accessible to all. Some of the silk
as reeled on the Piedmo.'itesc reel, some
n Brook's reel, and some on the common
lock reel. In the above parcel was
bout half a pound of even and excellent
ewing silk reeled from pierced cocootitf. ...
Irs. Spann also shewed us a number of.
ocoons which for firmness size and fine.'
ess, are seldom equaled, With a spirit
nd cntcrprize which ought to stir Up

lie is making arrangements to extend

of the past season satisfies her not
illy that the business is simple, hut that it
/ill also prove lucrative. Of such daughirs
South Carolina has cause to be more

THE ELECTION.
When Mr. Van Buren heard of the
lomination of (Jen- Harrison by the Harisburg
Convention, it is said that he renarked
the Genera! would either be eleced
by acclamation, or he would receive
cry few votes; and the event has proved
he correctness of Mr. Van Buren's judgencnt.
Gen. Harrison lias truly been
dected bv acclamation. In addition to
he states which we stated last week had
leclared for him wc now huve accounts
*t niri ih<i liillnwlnfr.
IVM.I 0.
Maine.?From this state we have reurns
enough to shew that the Whig
icket has prevailed by a majority of
rem 700 to 1000 votes.
Massaciiusktts has given a majority* . I
?f more than 10,000 for the Harrison tickit.
Senator Davis has been elected Gov- .
rnor by the same majority over Gov.
Horton. The state has elected ten Whig
ncmbcrsto Congress, among them John
i. Adams and one Democrat; his majoriy
about 20. In one district there was no
:!ioicc. The democratic candidate (now <
i member) had a plurality of 4 rvtes; scatering
votes 73. A majority of the whole
lumber of votes cast is necessary to an
dcction in Massachusetts. There must
>e another election.
Delaware.?This little state haseleced
the Whig ticket, by a majority of 823,
i Whig member of Congress, and a
Vhig Legislature. It has two U. S.
Senators to choose, who of coarse will
K)th be Whigs. New
York.?Although in (lie city and
nearest counties the Democrats gained,
he remoter counties much more than ^
nadc up the difference for the Whigs.?
The majority already reported for the
Yhig electoral ticket is over 12,000 and
o
vill be increased by returns yet to comc.
V majority of both branches of the state
.legislature is Whig; but the Democrats
iave cl osen 21 members to Congress, .
vhile the Whigs chose only 19.
Pennsylvania has chosea the Harrion
electoral ticket; but by a majority of
inly 264 out of 187,248 votes.
Virginia has gone for Van Burcn but
v what majority is vet known: probbty
about If.00.* " ' *
