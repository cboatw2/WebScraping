From the New York Sun.
We observe with astonishment and regret,
the conclusive evidence which appears in
every direction, that the business of Agriculture
does not receive the attention due to it
in this country, but is treated with absolute
neglect, compared with other pursuits?
This ought not to be, and the inhabitants of
this country will yet learn, that they have
committed a gross error by abandoning the
cmtivation of the 6oiI for less independent and
more precarious modes of obtaining a livelihood.
wun over hpard of such a state of
f f iiv I4MW %T V*
things as now exists here? We have a soil
as fertile as any that the sun ever shone upon,
a country almost boundless in extent and so
cheap, that any roan may purchase a farm
with the proceeds of a few months labor, yet
we are actually importing for consumption,
immense quantities of agricuitaral products
from foreign countries A pecple, thinly scattered
over a land unequalled in fertility, and
exh&ostkss in its resources, are buying their
bread, at enormous prices, from countries so
overburthened wito inhabitants, that political
economists have feared thit the earth wouid
fail to produce sufficient to support hem.
Such an extraordinary and unnatural circum**
stance should excite attention, and awaken
the inquiry as to its cause.
The fault, as we have seen, is not in the
soil, nor is the country overrun with inhabitants.
It is, therefore, evident that the cultivation
of the coil is neglected, otherwise we
should be exporting instead of importing agricultural
products, but it is easier to show the
fact, that agriculture is neglected, than to find
a sufficiant reason for such i eglect. We ap?J
that it will ha found f0
pi^ucuui uvnvivt|
spring, in a great measure, irom the 6amc
causes which have produced much evil in this
country, and the bitter fruits of which we are
now reaping. The first and chief of these
causes, is the inordinate thirst for wealth which
pervades every class of society, and induces
men to abandon their legitimate business to
engage in some wild, hazardous speculation,
in the hope of becom.ng suddenly rich. It is
also too often the case that the farmer becomes
tired of the moderate and gradual accumulation
of property by the products of his land,
and leaves the cultivation of it to engage in
the business of commerce or manufactures.
He finds out his egregious mistake when it is
too late. The property he had accumulated
is often squandered and lost in consequence of
his ignorance of new business, and he again
sighs for the cheer ul and independent mode
ofHie which he has abandoned, when it is out
of bis power to resume it. We have in our
mind numberless instancss of this kind, where
industrious and prosperous farmers have been
lured to their ruin, by being induced to lay
aside the implements of husbandry, and engage
in the* universal scramble after midden
wealth.
There is another great error prevalent upon
this subject, and that Is, the business of agri
jmiImita in cr#n?rallv looked upon as less respec
v y
table than that of commerce, manufactures, or
the professions; and wealthy farmers, instead
of teaching their sons their own business, most
usually transform them into merchants, lawyers,
doctors, or dominees. This is all wrong.
Agriculture is the very back-bone of all business,
the main-spring of all wealth, and should
be regarded as a profession of the highest re?
spectability. It gives those engaged in it a
feeling of ir:dependence, genuine nobleness,
without ostentation, honor, honesty and firmness,
well calculated to perpetuate ?he free
institutions of our happy country. The truth
of the eloquent panegyrics of the ancients upon
this employment may be more easily realized
here than in any other country upon earth.?
We confidently hope to see public opinion
speedily righting itself upon this subject, and
to find people seeking their permanent interests,
and advancing the prosperity and glory
of our wide domain, by engag ng more generally
in this healthful, honest and independent
business.

EARTHS AND SOILS.
In the investigation of agricultural sub
IJ
jects, it is necessary that we snouiu as cwrrectly
as possible, distinguish earths and
soils, and their varieties. The earths important
to agriculture, and A'hich form nearly
the whole surface of the globe, capable
of producing vegetation, are only four, viz:
silicious, aluminous, calcareous, and mag.
nesian.
As a full description of all the distinctive
characters of these earths could not be embraced
within the compass of my contemplated
communication, I shall merely mention
a few, by which may be understood tite
effects they necessarily produce in forming
a compound best calculated to promote ve.
getation.
Silicious enrth exiss in the state of sand.
It is composed of very hard particles, which
cannot be m ?de coherent by mixing with
water. The solidity of particles of sand
renders them impenetrable to water, and
their loose arrangement make sand incaparble
of retaining water. It is also quickly
heated by the sun, which adds to the rapidity
vi'h which it lesos
Aluminous earth, [clay] when dry, ad. i s
heres to the tongue, absorbs water rapidly t<
and abundantly, and when wet, forms a *
tough paste, smooth and soapy to the touch, tl
By burning, it becomes very ha.d ; when d
drying, aluminous earth shrinks greatly, it p
becomes a mass of hard lumps, separated c
by cracks and fissures, winch become so p
many lit le reservoirs of standing water c
when fi led by rains, and remarn so wjien it
the lumps, by slowly imbibing the water, s
are distended enough to fill the space oc- s<
cupied before. d
Calcareous earth, or carbonate of lime, c
is calcareous earth combined with carbonic c
acid, and may be converted into quick a
lime by heat. Lime is soluble in acids; c
during the solution the carbonic acid es.
capes effervescence. In this manner, the a
carbonate of lime, or calcareous earth, may d
not be easily distinguished from silicious a
and aluminous earths, but from all other it
combinations of lime. Magnesia earth,
like lime, is usually found in combination
with carbonic acid; but even in this, its
natural state, it exists in such very small tj
quantities in soils, and i9 found so rarely* q
that its name is a useless addition to the b
lists of the earths of agriculture. u
All the earths individually, when as pure n
as they are ever furnished by nature, ore ?
entirely barren, nor would any addition of p
putrescent manures, enable either of the ?
earths to support healthy vegetable life.? j,
The mixture of the three earths, in due pro. c
portion, will correct the defects of all, and
with a sufficiency of animal or vegetable j,
matter a soil is formed. Such is the natural |j
surface of almost all the inhabitable world, B
and though the qualities and value of soils, 0
are as various as the proportions of their f
ingredients, yet they are mostly so consti- e
tuted, that no one earthy ingredient is so ti
abundant but that the texture of the soil is H
mechanically suited to the production oi c
some valuable crop. Some plan's require r
a degree of closeness, and others of open- j,
ness in the soil, which would cause other
plants to decline or parish. As the qualities (
and value of soils depend on the proportions
of their ingredients, and the grand desideratum
in agriculture, is to obtain a mixture of
the earths, best calculated to produce variety
of the most valuable crops, we can (
satisfuctorially comprehend in what manner I r
I that object may be obtained. Silicious and t
aluminous earths, by their mixture, servo to t
cure tlie defects of each other. The open,
loose, thirsty and hot nature of sand, being
corrected by and correcting in turn the close
adhesive nud wet qualities of aluminous c
earth. This curative opperation, however,
is merely mechanical, and it seems proba. '
bio that calcareous earth, when tn large pro- i
portion, also aids the corrective power of
the other earths. In uddition also to the ,
mechanical effects of calcareous earth, it .
possesses chymical powers more effectual
j in altering the texture of soils, and for which
a comparatively small quantity is sufficient. .
The chemical action of calcareous |earth, as .
an ingredient of soils, will bo particularly ,
noticed hereafter, when we come ?o the consideration
of the food of ulants. From what
lias been said, it would appear reasonable
to class and name soils accord.ng 'o their
predominant earthy ingredients, which ex .
ert the greatest power, and most strongly ,
mark the character ol the soil. The predominant
ingredient is not always the most .
J abundant. If the most abundant was considered
the predominant ingredient, and
gave its name to the soil, then almost every
one should be called silicious, as that earth
is seldom equalled in quantity, by all the
others united. It the earthy parts of a soil
were two-thirds silicious, and one-third aluminous
earth, the peculiar qualities of the
smaller ingredient would predominate over
the opposing qualities of the sand, and the
mixture would be a tenacious clay. If the
same soil had contained only one-twentieth
part of calcareous earth, that ingredient
would have had more marked effects on
the soil, than could h ive been produced by
either doubling or diminishing to half their
quantity, the silicious and aluminous earths
which formed the great bulk of the soil.?
But everv farmer can rcadilv discover what
w V
are the most marked good or bad qualities
of his soil, as evinced under tillage, and i
those qualities can be easily traced to their s
predominant ingredients. A silicious, or a
sandy soil, has such a proportion of silicious f
earth as to show more of its peculiar pro- t
perties than of any other ingredient. It c
j would be, more or less, objectionable for its s
I looseness, h*at or want of power to retain v
moisture, and; not for toughness, liability to
become hard after wet ploughing, or any
other quality of aluminous earth. In like
manner an aluminous, or clayey soil, would
show strongly the faults of aluminous earth,
though more than half its bulk might be of
silicious earth. Hence every farmer can
readily judge of the perfection and of the
defects of his soil, which, from a knowledge
of the distinctive properties of the earths,
he will be enabled to correct by the addition
and mechanical mixture of such earto as
may appear to be deficient, thereby produce
a soil, the best calculated to promote the ;
growth and perfecion of vegetation.

CLAY.
As the beneficial cflf cts of clay on light
; and sandy soils is so generally understood
| and acknowledged, we are surprised that it
j is no: more extensively used in ameliorating |
: the condi.ion of soils of this nature. A 1

THE SILK CULTURE IN GEORGIA,
We had intended to have said somethinj
n favor of the cultivation of silk, and its im
nense importance to the Southern Statesman!
o Georgia in particular, but we find an edi
orial article in the Macon Telegraph, whicl
?o fully expresses out views upon the gen
:ral question, that we copyhand adopt th<
lentimcnu asour own. We shall confint
turselves at present to a brief notice of th<
trogress of this business in and about ou
:ity, so far as it has come under our obser
'ation. ^
A great number of persons in this cit;
tnd its immediate vicinity have planted thi
VI or us Multicaulis to a greater or lesss ex
ent; some for the purpose of speculatioi
n the trees alone, but the larger portion, w
jelieve, with a view to make experiment
n the production of Silk. Some aro si
ally satisfied as to the ultimate success c
he business, that they have embarked in i
vith the same feelings that a planter pur
:h tses lands and negroes for the purpose c
'aising co ton. Among those who em
jarked largely in it we may name Messrs
Sheeny & Hutchinson, as the largest plan
ers of the Morus Multicaulis. Mr. Cheen1
- ... . evil, r? :

This firm has fitted up a cocoonery in hand

Messrs. Plant & Mifflin have an extensiv<
:ocoonery fitted up on the corner of Greet
md Campbell streets. They are not nea

is the firm above alluded to, but hey havt
ar exceeded any others in this vicinity it
he number of worms fed this season. Indud
ing those now on hand, they have fed
tbout 300,009 worms, and have alreadj
veighed forty pounds of cocoons. Tb<
vhite mulberry alone was used at this co.
:oonery for some time, but they are now
ising the leaf of the Morus Multicaulis
vhich but a short experience satisfies then
s infinitely preferable to the other, not onlj
jccause it is easier raised, but because it i;
oore sp-edily gathered and far more nutri
ious, the worms actually abandoning th<
White Mulberry to feed upon it, A largt

pros'-cution of this business. Messrs. P
& M. have furnished us with many impor
tant hints gathered from their short experi
encein the business which we cannot con

business of producing silk, Mr. S. is ai
t axtensive planter of the multicaulis.
* In addition to those we have mentioned
* there are a great many others who havi

There are three letters before us, from

writers known to us as gentleman ofveracity.

"The crops at the south have in a great

3 stated to me to-day, he planted 30,000
buds, and would not have more than 1600
trees. 1 think if they do not get completely
discouraged this season, that the pro9.
pect is good for their maintaining the prices
B of last fall.
"Trees are held here at 50 cents for the
s growing crop, and fpw are willing to make
. sales at that price."
^ Another at Garmantown, May 30 :
3 "Contracts are being made, to a vrrv
3 limited extent, however, in Philadelphia, at
- 20 a 25 rents; but the producers held out
tl for an advance. At Burlington they fully
h calculate on from 40 to 50 cents ; and some
f heavy contracts have, I learn, been made
e at 40."
Y And a third at Germantown, 7th June,
^ The writer says
i "frees are now worth 40 to 50 cents on
fall contracts. K. S. [well known to the
Editor as a gentleman of the highest respec9
tability] told me to-day, that he had refused
. S3 cents, and said he would not take 50."
!* We have orders to sell a large number,
but the growers hav not named their price.
,l Buvers and sellers fight so shyly that they
0 can't be brought within striking distance of
T each other. Our own opinion is, that the

Louisiana, from their peculiar fimess to the
growth of the tree and the worm, will be im

This morning we had nn interview with a

n quirer, may bo esteemed one of the most
ii pregnant signs that the silk business, as a
st business, is about to b*> established on a firm
>t and extensive basis in the United States :
" Tie Silk Culture.?Mr. Morris Pollock,
' * 'he enterprizing Throwster of Glasgow, has
^ arrived in the Great Western, and has pro.
J? ceeded to Pittsylvania county, in this Stnt<j,
lr where he proposes to est. bhsh a large Mulberry
plantaiion, a Cocoonery, and a Fila.

^ himself of the Act of Assembly of 1833.

We had the pleasure of witnessing an in'r
teresting ?n erview on Friday evening bee
tween Mr. Pollock and Mr. D'Homergue.
lS They agree as to their views ot the best man.
0 ner of conducting the Silk business in the
lr United States. They think, that Virginia
n is calculated to be a great Silk State, but
0 that she ought to confine herself at present
to the nising of the Mulberry, and the
worm, and of reeling the Silk from the Co.
coons?and that it is probably best to establish
large Filatures, which will furnish a
o market for the Cocoons, and supersede the

grea. knowledge of his subject; and to
is show the most liberal disposition to coma

y out with him a quantity of the white Italian
v Mulberry; and presumed, that he could not
il get his cocoonery in operation before the
o third year?but the character of the muhie
caulis will enable him to go to work much
n sooner. Mr. D'Homergue has also great

it $200. In fact, ho contends that it will be

the mode so well described, of destroying
a most troublesome pest, is drawn from ttie
successful practice of older farmers and at*

Deer-Wood, Scott co , March 0,1830.
To the Editor of the Frank/in Farmer;
Dear Sir I cannot estimate the good
result of your paper among the farmers
generally, and especially to young begin*
ners like rayseif. In the 2&h No. of 0d
Vol. 1 see an article from Cato, requesting
information of ttttae old and experienced
farmers as to the best method of destroying
briars. You know, Mr. Editor, I must fall
short of that description of personage, but
not having seen the subject taken up by an
abler hand, 1 will venture a few remarks
subject to your abridgment or modification
(if you shall think them worthy) which I,
in my endeavors to become a good and
t c I I i?
practical farmer, nave gained from men ol
experience. I have known largo patches
of br ars (and farms that were almost unbroken
patches of briars,) effectually destroyed
in the following manner. Cut them
down at the dark of the moon in August two
years in succession. One year will answer
in a pus ure well stocked. It would be well
to put the laud in some kind of grass at
this time, as it appears almost an impossi.
btlity to kill them so long as the roots are
broken and disturbed by a plough. They
should be piled wi.h a pitchfork and burned
after cutting, as you would find it rather a
I serous job the next year, cutting among the
old ones left on the ground. My own experience
does not permit me to 9ay, whether
any other time in August would not do as
well as the dark of the moon. The abort time
I have been farming I have adhered entirely
to these rules and 'hey are the only effeetual
ones, 1 ever have heard of.
The best instrument for cutting them is
a briar scythe. One who understands cutting
with them will cut off sprouts half as
large as a man's wrist. In a fence comer
or such pi ice as they may not be got at easily
with a scythe, take a hemp knife or hoe;
possibly one who cannot use a scythe well
might find it advantageous to adopt tb*
hemp knife. I use the latter myself, not bein
/ able ro handle the former. There is
considerable slight in the use of both instruments.
The edges should be turned op so
as cut the stubble slanting towards you.?
It is besi not to be too timid of getting a litla
scratch. 8. Y. K.
MILKING.
In the morning the cows should bo driven
gently two or three times round the yard
before milking; they will yield more for tbe
I exercise. We have seldom hired a good
milker. Females are better than men,
| they have more patience. A good milker
will obtain at least one quarter more cream
f than one that milks slowly. We have often
t proved this ; we hired one summer a man
from New Hampshire who had managed a.
farm several years. He was clever but fefetremely
moderate ; we then hnd four fwwe *
in milk, and discovered that our slow milker
was fast drying up our cows : we conchi.
d<>d to give him our aid and let him. milk
only two ; on the first tnal he obtained the
same quantity that we did. In one week
we obtained one quart more than he at a
milking; he said his cowg were not equal
to ours; we then shifted, and obtaioad,
within nine days, more milk from h s cows
than he did from ours. This was wholly
to be ascribed to his moderate rn Iking, for
he left none in the udder.?'Boston Cuhi.

From the Albany Cultivator,
ACCIDENTS TO HORSES.
Rappahannock Co. Feb. 20, 1839.
Mr. Editor?Sir : Having been a subscriber
to your valuable paper for some months, I find
that it is designed for general utility and the
public good; therefore I desire to make known
through that medium, an accident to whieh
horses are liable, perhaps little known to the
public. In the year 1618, 1 had a sick horse,
and after using the usual remedies without rei:*.f
no last altamalivA I fiipd | trkO for
HCJf CiO 1J lb IQOb M<VV?MW?. , v . . ,L _
the purpose of tunning a mop down the"throat*
for I believed the horse was partially choked.
In this preparation* I accidentally discovered
part of a corn cob tight across the roof of tbe
mouth, which had prevented the passage of
any food to the stomach, save the juice occasioned
by mastication from repeated attempts
to eat. The cob was removed by a smooth
stick as large as a man's thumb, sufficiently
long to extend into the roof of the mouth. I
was then cautious not to let the animal eat
much at a time, until it recovered.
I have since relieved several horses from
the same accident, and I have do doubt thousands
of our most valuable animals have been
lost from the same cause without ever knowing
of what they died. I will here remark,
that it is sometimes very difficult to find the
piece of cob, and remove it after found, for it
will become very ti^ht and nearly concealed
by tho swelling and inflamation. I trust this
will find a place in your pappr* which pay be
of benefit to vopr numerous renders.
Yours, &c. J no, 0. Bnowwufe.
