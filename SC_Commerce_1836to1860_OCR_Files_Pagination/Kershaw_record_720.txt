AMERICAN COTTONS.
!f the following statement, which we copy
from a Whiff paper, be true, why docs the cotton
manufacturer in this country require a protection
so enormous, as to lie absolutely prohibitory!
If American cottons enter into successful
competition with British fabrics, not only in
South America, but even in fifjypt and China,
where there is no protective duty, why do they
demand at home an impost so exorbitant? if
These statements prove any thinjr, it is utterly
against the cause to sustain which they are produced.
??Tho rntfnn jroods of this conntrv. particular
Jy the cheaper descriptions, are brought to such'
perfection that they take the lead, ami are pre- j
Icrrecl in all the South American markets: nor j
can the British come in competition with them. (
The export of these poods is enormous. We j
were forcibly struck with the success the Ameri-1
can cottons have arrived at, from the relation of |
a friend who has recently returned from his j
travels in Greece, Syria, and Egypt. He states, j
that, inall the bazaars in Cario (Egypt) he saw j
o'splayed American cotton poods, with the Lnw<:V.
stamp carefully exposed to attract the eye of j
tirangcrs. This is a fact worth a thousand ,
theories. Here is a cotton country that is sup-;
plied with a large portion of their consumption :
ofpoods from Britain, and a country that exports j
nearly the whole cro^p of cotton to England, and
n country that has little or r.o trade with the U.
States, taking Lowell goods in preference to any
otker. Ifthe skill aud capital of Massachusetts
can furnish an article of as great consumption as
cotton goods are to the Egyptians, and a better
and c.lieancr article than thev can be supplied
villi from England, it is a fact of such striking
character as deserves great consideration."
We learn from a gentleman engaged in commerce,
that whereas England, so late as 1836,
sent about twenty-four millions of yards of ordinary
cotton fabrics, bleached and unbleached,
to the western coast of South America; in the
year 1839 she introduced but about eight millions,
the cheaper and decidedly better fabrics
from the United States having, in a great measure,
replaced them in that market. Our dved
cottons, jeans, and drillings, are also entering into
successful competition, having only boen introduced
within the last two or three years.?
Are American cottons protected in South America?

THE THREE STAGES OF A NATIONAL
BANK.
Mr. John C. Spencer, the present Whig Secretary
of War, and late one of the most prominent
leaders of that party in the State of New
York, gives in his recent letter a sketch of the
principal 6tagcs ofthe United States Bank, which j
it will be well for all to contemplate, as a warning
for the future.
The first step was from 1816 to 1820, before i
Mr. Biddle was President. Of this stage Mr.
Spencer gives the following picture:
"Within fcur years of its existence, the last
Bank of the United States became little better
than a den of robbers. Its managers, with few
pvcpn! ions, nursued a systematic scheme of nlun
der and fraud, which was arrested by the investigations
of a Committee of Congress."
The second stage was while it was still a na- 1
tional institution, but had passed under the management
of Mr. Biddle. This stage is portrayed 1
by J\lr. Spencer in these lines:
"Clemency (now believed to have been mistaken)
towards innocent stockholders, and a
hope that the example which had been made of
the offenders would deter others from similar
practices, saved the bank from dissolution. It
was allowed to proceed under new restrictions,
designed to prevent the recurrence of similar
frauds. In a few years, it was found at open
war with the Government of the country?seeking
the r" swal of its character, subsidizing
presses and editors, squandering its treasures in
partisan elections, and opehly purchasing the
support of the venal in all directions. The mor.
al corruption which thus flooded the whole country
was, in itself, an evil of the most fearful magnitude.
It struck deep at the roots of public
faith and private honor, and prepared the way
for that reckless and unbounded extravagance
which the bank itself stimulated by the profuse
distribution of money, and the consequences of
which we are now reaping in individual sufferings,
(from which a bankrupt law affords but I
slight relief,) and in the degradation of the character
ofour couutry by the fraudulent insolven- j
cies of our public corporations, and by the shameless
refusal of sovereiga States to fulfil their
obligations."
The third and last stage, was when^he Bank
had received an act of incorporation from the ]
representatives of a minority of the people of
Pennsylvania. This stage is thus described by j
Mr. Spencer:
"The final extinction of the same institution j
under a State charter, but managed by the same j
individuals, and the consequent inevitable expo-1
eition of its affairs, have disclosed scenes of the !
depravity and fraud at which the whole country j
stands aghast. Who can look back at the itn-1
mense amounts of public funds which have been ,
intrusted to the fidelity of the same men, with- !
out a feeling of horror at the abyss which we j
have escaped. Ana wi.o wouiu again veniure
the treasure of the nation upon the integrity of
arty body of individuals in an associate capacity,
when we have before us such reiterated exam-j
pies of the feebleness of the mo6t unspotted pub-1
lie and private characters, to resist the ternpta- i
tions which attend the control of enormous wealth i
and inordinate power? How can any Govern- j
inent justify itself in thus transferring to corporate
individuals the function with which it is entrusted
for the welfare of the people? The collection,
the preservation, and the disbursement
of the public revenue, is the business of the Government
itself, through its own agencies, with
all the responsibilities of office, ana jjith the securities
of oaths, bonds, and constant check and
supervision."

A SAD AFFAIR.
One of the most melancholy spectacles ever
witnessed in the Western country, will take
place to-morrow, at Frankfort, Ky. The occasion
is the Kentucky Barbecue to Ohio "greeting."
The appointments and preparations were
made some time before the election in this State,
and were intended to be a grand jubilee, in commemoration
of the 'great Whig Victory in Ohio!'
But alas! for Whiggery. The guests of the
vjwtuiii^ isui*vjut*i) uiv 11 (iiiciwi uicvi u/ iiiuuincirt i
The Whig papers of this city whisper not a
word of the Kentucky Barbecue. Tiie Wnig
journals of Kentucky say very li".ic on the subject.
The whole nflair is evi.lc.i'Iv a dead drag,
and all parties concerned are plainly sick of'it.

in the Stale of Ohio, A. D., 1842;?literally |
eaten by the ravenous Locos! j'
Alas! the age ol" Barbecue is gone,?the spirit i
of'40 is dead, and "that same old coon" skinned
and buried! As a mailer of course, Whiggery l
being in so bad a plight, there will be very few i
Clay patriots and "virgin heifers" at Frankfort i
to-rnorrw.

heart-rending description of? 1
"The onfaktuhe?Vesterday morning, the i
line oi march wax taken up, by ihe ('lay Army, j
There were lour hacks, twelve horsemen and]
sixty-five footmen, and one baggage wagon. It:
is thought some of the horsemen, and some of]
the fooimen, would return, afier going a mile or
i wo, to put the others well upon their journey, ]
and keep them in face till they pass the suburbs. |
The whole were under the command of Captain
Graves and Quarter Master Speed We have '
no comments to make on the departure of the I
Grand Arm}'. Nothing of interest occurred on \
their going forth. Perhaps we may hear of them i
on the road. If we do, as a faithful chronicler, j
we shall narrate it."
'Since the foregoing was in type, we have
heard from the cortege, at the five mile house.
It had dwindled to the following dimensions, 31
whites, 3 of whom were on horseback?6 blacks,
5 of whom were musicians, and 3 boys. Verily
the banner city is nobly represented!"

Our Credit Abroad.?The- failure of the
agents of our National Government to negotiate
a loan in Europe, (of which intelligence was re- ,
ceived by the late arrivals,) is considered by,
some of our contemporaries as an unfortunate:
circumstance. VVe cannot so view it. It will i |
create a necessity for that retrenchment and 1i
economy which ought to have been adopted vol- j
untarily before the law for the loan was passed, i
Had the Whig Congress and Administration, at i
their first accession to power, pursued vigorously 1
the system of retrenchment which they had pro- <
mised, and which had been commenced by Mr. i
Van Buren's Administration; and had they, as i
soon as the deficiency of revenue to meet the 1
expenses appeared likely to arise, adopted a tar- ]
iff for increasing the duties in a reasonable and t
equal ratio, instead of postponing the measure (
with a view to force the President to consent to i
the land distribution project, there would have /
been no necessity at all for asking for the new i
loan. t
Some consider it both desirable and a proof of t
prosperity, to have the credit of the Government I
stand high. We do" not consider i! 6n in a'l ca- I
so?, cither with nations or with individuals.? I
Many a man's credit lias stood higher when in a i
state of hopeless'insolvency, than when lie pos- 1
sessed a moderate fortune. The United States t
Bank had a higher credit abroad when it was on i
the verge of bankruptcy, than at some periods
when its capital was nearly entire. Some na-1 c
done and slates have higher credit when over- | s
whelmed with debt, than when but little encumbered.
Too much credit is the source of misfortun
with individuals, corporations, and states. It
lempts to extravagance and wastefulness. The
United States Bank, by its schernps to puff the
credit of the newer States of this Union, and by I
it6 accommodations for the negotiation of their j
loans, led them to the condition of practical repudiation
for the present in which we find them. J
That the Government of the United States, in a <
time of perfect peace, and with no occasion for
extraordinary ex|>enditure?, cantiOt#be brought
into a similar condition through the improvidence
of those who acquired power by false representations,
is truly fortunate for the nation at large
?fortunate for the tax-payers, though not altogether
grateful to the tax-consumers.
DEMOCACY FOREVER.
With what a glow of proud satisfaction can
the Democrat who withstood the political whirlwind
of 1840, look back upon his course in that
memorable contest, and changes that have since
taken place. He can exclaim in the majesty of
a freeman?"Truth is mighty and mil prevail."

Democratic party?doctrines based upon jus'ire.

man?lie clung to theiri in the dark hours of disaster
and defca??when an overwhelming majority
of the people in almost every Stale in the
Union seemed to have lost their reason, and 1

Wonderful Preservation.?Mr. Alfred Hitchcock,
of this village, and his wife and son, were
so providentially preserved on Saturday last, thai
a statement of the particulars will doubtless be
interesting. They were returning from a visit
to the Niagara Falls, and had arrived within
about four miles of home, when it became so
dark that Mr. H. thought it unsafe to proceed
farther without procuring a lantern. Willi this
view, on ascending a hill, and seeing a light in
a house near by, he rose to get out, when the
horses suddenly started, jerked the reins front
his hands, and rushed furiouslv down the onno
site side of the hill, nearly upsetting the carriage,
and throwing Mr. H.? with a part of his
baggage, to the ground. On recovering from
his fall, he could hear nothing of his team, lie
rallied several persons in pursuit, and with one
of them in a one-horse wagon, succeeded in
reaching the viliage.
The frigh'ened horses, left entirely without
I control, had (lashed on in the darkness at the
! top of their speed, "up hill* and down dalp,'*
[over parts of the road extremely rough, with
\ Mrs. 11. and her son seated in the bottom of the
carriage, crying for help, but crying in vain.?
Arrived at the village, they crowed the bridge,*j
passed up Main-street, and proceeoeu mi uasi
about a mile, then turned north, and slacking ,
ilieir pace a litlle as they ascended a hill, Mrs. (
H. salely leaped from the carriage. The horses ,
renewing their speed; she could not rescue her
son, but could hear his cry, "mother, mother," I
until the sound died upon her car. What must i
have been her feelings at this moment?snatched,
herself, apparently, from the very jaws of
death, her husband, as she thought, either kill-1
ed or badly injured, and her child torn from her;
under circumstances of the utmost peril. The !
horses continued till they struck the Genesee ;
road, on which they proceeded over a mile, de-j
scended into a deep gulf, and then taking a
northeasterly course went on nearly a mile far-!
ther, when reaching a sandy piece of road, near]
the residence of John Adams, Ksq, they became]
exhausted and fell. The boy jumped from the i
carriage, ran into the house, and with great!
coolness and presence of mind, told the family
his perilous jaunt, and asked for lodgings for,
the night. In the mean time, scores of people'
in the village and along the route had started in
pursuit. The boy was soon found, and the fath-1
er, mother and son restored to each other's em-;
brace, with no other than aslight injury sustained
by Mr. H. in his fall. The carriage too,
was unbroken, and the horses only badly fatigued
with their race of nine miles.
This bridge is at the outlet of the lake, and
very dangerous to pass in the dark.

Kidnapping.?On Wednesday the 19th inst,
two individuals carne to Newbern, having in'
their possession a young negro woman, whom
they represented as their properly, and offered
her for sale. They stated that they lived in
Wayne county, and that the girl's name was
Rose. During the day they made a sale of the
orirl. to one of our citizens?who had not the least
suspicion but that all was right?for $250, and
gave a bill of sale under the names of Wilkins.
and Mitchell. They appeared very anxious to i
sell the girl, giving as a reason, that a piece of i
land which they owned was soon to be sold under ;
in execution, and that they wished to make a |
sale to raise money for the purpose of stopping (
in time the sale of the land. They left town (
ate in the evening of the same day. Some sus- ,
licions arising the neu day, that there might be
something wrong in the transaction, the girl was;1
juestioned closely, but still persisted in the same'1
icoount given by the two men who sold her ? j'
Yl length, however, of her own accord, she sta- j t
ed I hat tieiiher of the men was her master; that | (
heir names were rot those in the bill of sale, and I.
hat they do no; live in Wayne, ounty. She says |
ter master lives in Sampson couu'y, and that i
lis name is John Bag.-: that she ran away from]'
liin some time since, and agreed with these two ;
nen to take her off to smue distant place and sell '
ler. There real names she states to be Mat- i
hew Rayiter and James Weeks?and that her
iwn name is Mcrinda.
Early on Friday morning, upon the strength
if this statement, her purchaser started in pur- f
iuit of the individuals who sold her to him. The 1
wo men who gave their names as Mitchell and j
iVilkins, took the Western road, and are in a I
wo horse cart, with a pair of grey horses. I
We had prepared the above siatement for pub- i
ication last week, hutc included to defer it until <
re could ascertain whether the girl s statement '
vas true or not. The purchaser of the girl re- 1
limed to town on Thursday evening, and Baysl

KOSCIUSKO. i
The following admirable anecdote of the well
cnown Polish hero, is told in the London Times: f
Kosciusko reached the New World unprovi- }
led with letters of recommendation or introduc- 1
ion, and almost pennyless. He, however, asked I
in audience with Washington, to whom he bold- t
y presented himself. 1
" What do you see here?" inquired the general, 1
.vit.h his accustomed brevity. '
'1 come to fight as a volunteer for American ]
udependence," was the equally brief and fear
ess reply. 1
"What can vou do!'* was Washington's next '
? ? - O _
juestion. i
To which Kosciusko, with hie characteristic <
simplicity, only rejoined: 5
"Try me." " I
This was done. Occasion soon offered, when
liis talents, science, and valor were evinced; and, I
shove all, his great character was daily apprer.ia- 1
ted. He was speedily made an officer, and fur- '
therdistinguished himself.
lie had not long been in America, when he 1
had occasion to show his undaunted courage as i
captain of a company of volunteers.
Generals Lee and Conway, notwithstanding |
the height of the battle in which they themselves I
were fully engaged, [this battle was fought, if i
our memory serves us right, at the junction of
the Great and Little Pedees, South Carolina,]
observed with satisfaction the exertions of a company
which advanced beyond all the rest, and
made its attack in the best order.
"Who led the first company?" asked General
Conway of his comrades, on the evening of the
memorable day.
The answer was, it was a young Pole, of noble
birth, but poor?his name, if I am not mistaken,
is Kosciusko.
The sound of the unusual name, which he
could hardly pronounce, tilled the hero with so
eager a desire for the brave stranger's acquain
ance, thai he ordered ins horse to be saddled,
and rode to the village, a couple of miles off
where the volunteers were quartered for the
night.
W ho shall describe :ne pleasure or me one or
the other, when the (Jen. entered the tent, saw
he Captain covered f'rom head to foot with blood,
dust, and sweat, seated at a table, his head resting
upon his hand, and examining the edge of
his sword, with a map of the country spread out
'tfiforc liiin, and a pen and inkstand by bis side
eside the map. A cordial grasp of bis hand by
Jeneral Conway imparted to the modest hero
iiis commander's satisfaction, and the object of a
visit paid at so unusual an hour.

inducements which are found in no other

Teaching young children to walk too
rouNG.?Some fond parents, disregarding the
act that the bones are completely soft and plia)le
in infancy, in their hurry to see the little obects
walk without support, are continually soiciting
attempts at standing or walking long bebre
the bones have acquired sufficient power ol
esistance and the muscles sufficient power ol
mntraction to cope with the laws of gravitation.
I'hp nafur.il ronseouence is a curvature of the
lone, which yields just like an clastic stick
lending under a weight. The ends approach
icarer lo each other than they ought to do; and,
ii accommodate themselves to the change, the
nuscles become shorter on one side, and perlaps
longer on the other, each losing part of its
Hficiency in the unnatural change it undergoes.
Prom this view, it will be seen how hurtful leadng
6tring6 must be. In the first place; by their
nechanical force, they compress the chest, and
mpede respiration; ,nd in the second, by pre enting
the body from Tailing to the grouud, or
arher by preserving an upright position, they
ause more of the weight lo fall on the bones of
he spine and lower extremities than those parts
ire tilted to rarrv. From this obnoxious pracice,
flatness of chest, confined lungs, distorted
ipino, and deformed legs, often originate.

! Great Britain and this country was ratified on
the 14th ult The official notice of the ratifica;
tion will be brought out by the Great Western which
is daily expected. The cotton market was
! exceedingly dull, and prices had declined from
? to $d per pound. There is no other news of
special interest by this arrival.
Legal Decision.?We have been favored with
the following decision in the case of David H.
: Shuler, who joined the "Camden Independent
i Fire Engine Company," (which exempted him
I by its charter, from performing Militia duty,)
I while the Beat Company to which he was attach.
' ed, was below its compliment, which we publish
j for the benefit of those who now are, or may
1 hereafter become interested.
The State, ex Relatione D. H. Shuler, vs. the
Sheriff of Kershaw.?Suggestion in Prohibition.
! The parties having come before me, and on
sufficient cause being shewn to the contrary, it
is ordered, that a prohibition do issue, prohibiting
r and restraining the sheriff from collecting the

At Chambers, at Camden, Oct 23,1842.
J. P. DICKINSON, for Petitioner,
Another "Traitor."?John C.'-Spewcer,
at present the Secretary of War, and formerly
one of the big guns of whiggery, has published a
long letter in the New York papers, in which he
throws off the yoke, and defines his position.-?
He has been heretofore, considered one of the
warmest friends of IVfr. Clay, and rendered efficient
services in the coonskin campaign of 1840.
YVh-ther .Mr. S. changed his notions because he
was convinced they were wrong, or (as the whig
prints contend) because he valued hie office more
than his principles, we shall not pretend to decide?but
be his motives what they may, he
gives waggery, especially the Bank portion of
it, some pretty severe kicks. Speaking of the
defunct monster, he says: "Within four years
of its existence, the last Bank of the U. States
became little better than a den of robbers. Its
managers, with few exceptions, pursued a systematic
scheme of plunder and fraud, which was
only arrested by a committee of Congress."?
This is, certainly, a dark picture, but there is little
doubt of its truth, and being drawn by one
who baa stood high in the estimation of the whigs,
will have its influence on many members of that
party. Mr. Spencer also speaks in strong terms of
condemnation of the corrupt and nefarious principle
of taxing the people to raise money for distribution.
Thus, while the whigs are predicting a split
and "flure-up" in the democratic ranks, because
several eminent statesmen have been recommended
for the Presidency in different quarters,
P we 6e that party daily falling to piecies. From
p the man of eminence and learning, down to the
I daily laborer, they are leaving its ranks and
discarding their deceptive principles.

good old Lancaster has burst the bands of In- ^
