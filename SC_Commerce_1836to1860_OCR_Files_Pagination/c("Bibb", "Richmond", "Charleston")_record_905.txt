sin, and therefore it would be wrong to exclude mem
bers from the church for it under all circumstances—
while she has no intention, tacit or expressed, of insist
ing on such a proposition in our present circumstances,
deeming it both unjust and impolitic,—yet it is her in
tention to’ abide by the constitution of the church as it
now is, and to use her constitutional powers for the
’extirpation’ of slavery, as prudence, the best interests ol
the whole church and the Providence of Qod may de
mand ; and we believe she would not listen a moment
to any proposition requiring her to restrict her present
constitutional rights to discuss, to petition or to legis
late on the subject.”
Dr. Bond regards this as furnishing the required
guarantee, and exultingly spreads the whole ar
ticle before his readers. But he must calculate
largely upon the susceptibilities of those leading
brethren at the South, who have access to the
Zion’s Herald, if he thinks that they will be satis
fied with it. Many of the abolitionists have been
driven temporarily, by stress of argument, from the
position that all slaveholders are sinners, and in
order to save the fundamental position of abolition
ism, have taken refuge in the distinction between
the principle and the legal relation of slavery. The
Editor of Zion’s Herald would ‘‘question the sani
ty” of the tnan who should insist that the “legal oi
nominal relation of master and slave” is ‘‘in all
cases sinful.” Yet he believes “that the principle
of slavery is radically, and under all circumstances
sinful, bflt the relation may exist without the.prin
ciple.” “The essence of slavery (he says) is the
chattel principle, and no man, who has in his breast,
we will not say religion, but a soul, should toler
ate this tor a moment.” He thus states the condi
tions on which the slaveholder may escape implica
tion in the sinfulness of slavery.—“Mow although
a man may, by local circumstances and laws, be
compelled to sustain the nominal relation of slave
holder, yet he need not sustain their immoral chattel
thip principle. He can practically disown it to his
slaves and the world.” “He can denounce it as
sinful and eschew it. In fine, there is no slave
holder in the South who cannot assemble his
slaves and declare to them that, though the laws
will compel them to remain under his responsibili
ty, yet he disowns the principle of chattelship.in
them, relinquishes the right to separate or sell
them, will pay them a just return for their labor,
and allow them when they please, to depart to oth
er states and take care of themselves.” He sup
poses that there is guilt involved in every case ol
alaveholding, but if the slaveholder pursues the right
course, the guilt is devolved wholly '‘upon the law
givers and their constituents.” But this princi
ple of chaltelship is nothing more than the speci
fic legal tenure by which the persons and services
of slaves are held, in contradistinction to hiring or
mere apprenticeship. For a man to disavow this
principle and ypt consent to sustain the legal rela
tion, is only to condemn the principle upon which
hepractises. The chaltelship principle does not
require, or suppose, that slaves shall be treated
otherwise than as men. I may go to a livery sta
ble, and hire of the proprietor a carriage and hor
ses, and also the services of a son in his minority,
or an apprentice as a driver. I hold all these by
precisely the same tenure. 1 engaged the servi
ces of the driver just as t engaged the services of
the horses, but this does not destroy, in my estima
tion, the distinction between a man and a horse.
This distinction between the principle, and the re
lation of slavery is, in effect, though not in inten
tion, pure jesuitism. It enables a man to do what
is declared to be immoral, viz., to hold a man in the
same relation in which he holds his chattels—as
legal property, and yet not be chargeable with im
morality. Who, of our slaveholding brethren is
prepared to avail himself of the benefit of this theory,
by calling his slaves together and assuring them
that the laws by which they are held in slavery
are unjust and immoral, that he sustains his pre
sent relation to them as a matter of pure legal ne
cessity, and that they have a right to withdraw
from his service whenever they please 1 The
Christians who will allow themselves to be com
pelled by law to carry out into practice essentially
and confessedly immoral principles, will never win
the crown of martyrdom. This shrewd distinction
will of course be abandoned as soon as it has an
swered its purpose.
Again, the Zion’s Herald firmly objects to any
measure which would tie the hands of abolitionists
when, in their estimation, it shall become just,
and politic, and expedient &c. ‘‘to withdraw fellow
ship from all slaveholders.” Our brethren at the
East, are at present restrained by the fear of Or
ange Scott, on the one hand, and a separation from
the main body on the other.
The answer of the Zion’s Herald, • unsatisfac
tory as it must have been to those brethren at the
South who are in a position to survey the whole field
of operations, gave dissatisfaction to many mem
bers of the New England Conference. Very soon
a manifesto was issued by five preachers, protesting
against retaining slaveholders in the church—de
precating any compromise which should prevent
an entire separation. I said to myself, what will
Dr. Bond say to this! It was directly contradic
tory to the assurances which he had just given to
the south. He took no notice of it in his paper.
It was not the thing he wanted. He took good
care not to give the slightest hint of this “disclaim
er.” This, for some weeks, became the prevailing
tone of the Zion’s Herald. At last, opt came the
article entitled “Things as they are,” signed by
sixteen additional preachers. Did the Dr. give his
readers an opportunity of reading it? Not at all.
It would be too likely to disturb the impressions
he had been making. This article gave rise to
considerable agitation in New England. The laity
rose up to protest. Correspondents objected. The
Editor of the Heralt^saw a storm gathering. He
had no difficulty then, in knowing which way the
Wind blew, and* so navigated accordingly. The
controversy was instantly suppressed. The editor
came out with the declaration that the offensive
article was misunderstood. He says, “We believe
our correspondents have misapprehended the do
cument, because they all concur in the impression
that it is hostile to and is designed to counteract
oil? late reply to the question of the Christian Ad
vocate and Journal, whereas our un(]erstanding
was that it was designed to reaffirm emphatically
the editorial position of the Herald. It was with
this impression that we called attention to it, and
at least one fourth of the signers have Since in
formed us that this was their intention in signing
it.” Dr. Bond at last ventures to refer to this ar
ticle, though not In publish it. *‘We are gratified to
find ‘things as they are’ wearing a more peaceful
aspect in New England than we had'inferred from
the article in Zion’s Herald signed by hr. Porter
and others; and notwithstanding our own under
standing of that article seems to have been coin,
mon to most readers of the Herald, an we gather
from t he Herald itself and from our own privato ad
vices, from the East, and the North, and, as we
learn front the Western Christian Advocate, in the
West sIbo.
‘•The editor of the Herald assures us that the
brethren who signed the article have been misun
derstood. They really meant to corroborate and
endorse the opinions of the editor with respect to
the state of feeling which exists in the New Eng
land churches in regard to church action on this
subject; and which wo copied into the Advocate
with approbation ; and we have assurance of this,
too, from at least two of the signers. This precludes
all controversy, the brethren arc entitled to their
explanation &c.” Such an explanation as this
from Bishop Soule in reference to certain mat
ters in controversy, would have left the Dr. “inex
tricably mystified,” but as it happens to be just
what he desires, he is bound to accept it, and it
precludes all controversy. This is the disclaimer
which the editor of the South Western Christian
Advocate will he afraid to publish. Let us now
inquire what it amounts to.t What does it die.
claim 1—an intention to insist upon the exclusion
of all slaveholders from the church 1 This is evi
dently Dr. Bond’s understanding of i&- But the
article most distinctly and unequivocally avows
this intention,’ It precludes any other sense. It
says in reference to compromise :
“.Now, dear brethren, permit us to inquire if this is our
true policy 1 Does it at all harmonize with our anti
slavery principles and action 7 Have you not repeat
edly expressed the wish that slaveholders would leave
the church 7 Not only those of you who have been
forward in the Anti-slavery movement, but have not
others expressed the same 7 And is it consistent, now
that they arc about doing so, for any of us to oppose
them, or to allow the impression that we wish them
to remain 7 Ought we not to multiply the encourage
ments if possible tenfold 7’’ Again, “Dr. Bond has dis
covered that he cannot prevent a separation and retain
all slaveholders, (a part of whom he acknowledges to
be slavetraders,) but he is striving to retain ns many as
possible. Now, suppose these effort* succeed in hold
ing one hundred thousand of the exceptionable members
of the church, what better off will New England be for
the separation. The complaint against the church is,
not that we have so many who hold and treat human be
ings as property, but that we have any.” “Where then
is the propriety in so much hostility to the separation 7
Why not let the. slaveholders go, as they proposed 7
We believe, brethren, you ought to speak out and protest
against Northern interference to retain them in the
church. Dr. Bond calls for explanation, and it is due to
him, to the south, and to the whole church thnt we give
it. For ourselves we most fully respond to that
call, by saying, that if he persuades slaveholders to re
main in the church, we shall do our best to reform or
exclude them. And if the discipline as it now is, is in
sufficient for our purpose, we will seek to have it so ul-!
tered that all who hold their fellow beings, as articles of
merchandise, shall, after Christian admonition and in
dulgence, be cut off if they do not reform. We want
this to be distinctly understood as our unalterable posi
tion.” “Slaveholdershave been flattered to believe that
they may remain and do as they have done, and all will
be peace, it is time they were undeceived,—that if they
prefer slavery-Melhodism to good old anti-slavery Meth
odism, they may go at once and go altogether.”
There is but oneway of understanding this lan
guage, and that is the way in which the readers and
correspondents of the Herald, Dr. Bond, who is
not liable to misunderstand such plain English, and
the brethren at the south, understood it. The edi
tor of the Herald himself does not understand it
otherwise. In his editorial endorsement, lie says,
“We call attention to a document from Br. Porter
and others in this week’s Herald. We believe
that New England will concur in its sentiment.
Though we have opposed the ‘Plan’ of separation,
yet we presume all of us have done it strictly in
reference to its constitutional aspects, and not in
reference to its object viz., the separation of slavery
from the church. In our own articles we have de
clared a separation inevitable ; we believe a divis
ion, such as shall put an end to this vexatious con
troversy, to be most desirable ; we have wished
only' lor a better ana more etlectual plan tor it—
but, rather than not have it take place, we would
consent to any plan, however faulty, if at all admis
sible by our conscience.—Let us, dropping all other
and secondary aspects of the subject, as one man,
keep a steady eye on attempts to compromise sla
very and retain it in the church.** The important
“disclaimer” amounts to this, and no more, that
the document thus endorsed, was not designed to
conflict with the editorial position of the Herald as
stated in a previous paper. The secret is that
this Editor rides the fence, occasionally, and finds
i: convenient to dismount, sometimes on one side,
and sometimes on the other. That tho document
was designed to reaffirm the position of the Herald
as Dr. Bond wished the south to understand it, I
do not believe. Dr. Bond does not believe it. No
man in his senses can believe it. I leave it to those
concerned to reconcile what appears contradictory.
Importance is attached to the opposition made
to the doctrines of the sixteen preachers, by the
patrons and correspondents of the Herald, but we
are not informed of the ground of their opposition.
We may, perhaps, obtain some light on this point,
by referring to the article of Br. I lusted, who, if 1
mistake not, is not an avowed abolitionist. He is
one of the sturdiest opponents of what is called ul
tra-abolitionism at the East. We have the ground
of his objection to the address, in the following
passage:
“If, as I soberly believe, a majority of the south are
or will be for holding on to the church as it is, and
are desirous of doing so, that the crisis in shivery may
be hastened, are we doing the clever thing in “multiply
ing encouragements" to divisionists “tenfold.” Suppose,
with our views of the inherent sinfulness of slavery, we
were situated as our anti-slavery brethren in the South
are, should we not be likely to feel aggrieved, wronged,
and outraged by such a course as some are now pursu
ing toward them 1 1 do not object to “ slaveholders pro
per" leaving the church, and setting up for themselves.
With all my heart Isay, let them go. J would do any
thing consistent with constitutional provisions to rut
the church of them. I will go as far as Or. Porter or
any one else, to procure all necessary constitutional pow
er (if we do not now possess it) for this purpose; and
shall be glad to have all in the South, mho are for abiding
with vs, understand this as the undivided sentiment, of
the North,—that, see mean not to cease our efforts till the
church is thoroughly expurgated. But do sue need
any more power than we now possess? Let
the results of the really constitutional proceedings of the
late General Conference, answer. Whence all this stir,
and clamor and violence in tlie Smith ? the abettors of
oppression literally quaking with terror, and agonized
with fear for the safety of their accursed Dagon ?
whence, but, that in the constitution of our church as it
is, they recognize a power omnipotent to its end, the
expulsion of all iniquity from her pale. 1 appeal to in
telligent abolitionists, if with such a power in our hands,
n power so efficient—as is demonstrated by the present
tumult in the South—for the purpose of civil and reli
gious enfranchisement it is consistent for us to relinquish
It just ns we are on the eve of employing it with such
unparralled success ? as relinquish it we shall, the mo
ment we surrender our present jurisdiction over the
south.
This is a specimen of the New England conser
vatism invoked by Dr. Bond. Herein the reason,
why division is not desired—New England would
then have to mind her own business 1 Such is
the rebuke which "ultra abolitionism” may expect
from the ‘‘eastern churches.” The italicising in
the above quotation is by the author. Publish the
"disclaimer” brethren—publish it by all means,—
send out extras if it be necessary. Let your peo
ple have all the light that shines, and for candour’s
sake do not allow them to be wbplly dependent
upon the Christian Advoeate and Journal. Hon

A MEMBER OF THE NEW YORK CONFERENCE.
Fur the Southern Christian Advocate.
The Wentwurlh-slreet Baptist Church of Charles
ton, South Carolina, to the Board of Managers
of the General Convention of the Baptist denomi
nation of the United Stales.
Dear Brethren, — We are happy that your
Thirty-first Annual Meeting, about to be held in
Providence, affords us the opportunity of remon
strating with you on a matter upon which we
are aggrieved. It would have been more desira
ble, in our view, to have expressed our minds upon
this painful subject through the usual channels of
our Association and State Convention. But the
occasion of disunion and strife which it presents is
pressing; and a majority of brethren around us
feel* that there is no time for this delay.
The grievance to which we'allude, is contained
in a portion of the reply of your acting Board to
the Resolutions of the late Alabama Convention.
For ourselves, we should not have been disposed
to ‘ demand’ any avowal by the Board of the rights,
and privileges of Slaveholders, or any other class
of the brethren. Those rights and privileges are
entire, of course, in themselves. Nor do we feel,
as yet, that the Board has, by any actual measure,
infringed them. But your acting Board puts the
supposed case of a Slaveholder offering himself for
a Missionary, and then declares, that if he should
insist on retaining this property, they could not
appoint him. “ One thing is certain,” it is added,
‘‘we can never be a parly to any arrangement
which would imply approbation of slavery.”
This expression of their opinion, and the hypo
thetical resolve accompanying it, is, as a whole,
highly offensive to us. It prejudices their own
privileges while it assails ours. These brethren
of the acting Board may never have the privilege
of deciding such a question. But it more particu
larly aggrieves us, as in direct violation of the fra
ternal neutrality of our compact in the Mission, on
the exciting subject of slavery.
The last Resolution of the Triennial Conven.
tion was, “That in co-operating together as mem
bers of the Convention in the work of Foreign
Missions, we disclaim all sanction, either express
ed or implied, whether of slavery or anti-slavery ;
but as individuals we are perfectly free both to
express and to promote elsewhere our own views
on these subjects, in a Christian manner and
spirit.”
We submit to you, Brethren, that the language
of the acting Board expressly contradicts this Re
solution. The Convention declares thereby, that
it ‘‘ disclaims all sanction of—anti-slavery” opin
ions. This reply of the acting Board is in terms
anti-slavery. The Convention leaves all brethren
free ‘‘to promote elsewhere their own views” on
the subject ‘‘either of slavery or anti-slavery.”
But the acting Board in effect follows us elsewhere,
! to see what kind of property we hold,and whether
we will retain it—declaring that if we hold a par
ticular kind, we shall not be appointed to any Mis
sion. What right would the acting Board, or even
| the Convention itself (with submission) have to in*
terfere with any property a brother held in the case
supposed 1 And, especially, what right to interfere
with this particular kind, respecting which they
have solemnly declared that they left him free to
follow his own views 1
In these circumstances, we would, with all kind
ness and respect, request our Brethren of the
Board of Managers to revise the reply of the ac
ting Board. Could it be regarded as that of the
Convention, it would leave to us no alternative but
a forced retirement from the held of joint labor in
Foreign Missions. It would drive us out of that
field. All share of personal labor therein is forbid
den by the acting Board to nine-tenths of our breth
ren at the Mouth. And would not its language
become suicidal on the designation and incorpora
tion of the Board, as u The General Convention
of die Baptist denomination of the United Stales
It would sever the union of the Baptists of the
Northern and Southern States. Already has it
become a brand of serious discord in many of our
Churches and Congregations. We intreat you, we
affectionately claim, that you withdraw it. The
neutral ground so explicitly taken by the late Tri
ennial Convention satisfies us. Its expression of
fraternal neutrality on this exciting subject satisfies
us. VVe are not conscious of having, on our part,
in the slightest way, infringed upon it Why should
our Northern brethren have done so ! What was
their authority for doing this 1 What their inten
tion in doing it 1
In great anxiety to learn that you have reconsi
dered and recalled such a hasty expression of zeal,
either without knowledge, or in entire forgetfulness
of our case, now deeply and injuriously affected
by it, we remain, dear Brethren, respectfully your
affectionate Brother in the Lord.

April 15, 1845.
The Cotton Market of this week remains pretty
much in the same condition (as to prices,) as
those of the preceding week, and we quote the
name; although some contend that buyers have ]
had some slight advantage—others state the ad
vantage, of right belongs to the seller.—The ac
counts from Liverpool, expected in a day or two
by the Great Western steamer, will fix the matter
of prices, beyond controversy.

Se* Steamers.—The Mndisonisn says, “The new
Post Office act, authorizing the Postmaster General to
contract with American citizens for carrying the Uni
ted States mail, between the United States and foreign
countries, and between ports of the United States by sea
and the Gulf, in steamers capable of being made into
efficient vessels of war at the shortest notice, to be taken
into the naval service by the United States in time of
war, at an appraisement, opens a wide field for the en
largement and improvement of the means for national
defence. The routes.from Wilmington to Charleston,
and from Mobile to New Orleans, and from New Or
leans to Galveston, should be put in operation in iron
steamers—they being the most secure and lightest of
draught—at an early day. We understand the cost
will not be greater to the United States than the present
service, and then the complaints for failures, on the for
mer route especially, will be heard no more.”
Mania a Potu—Horrible Incident.—A man that
ale his own fingers.—Two young gentlemen, hunting
about a mile Southwest of the city, in a swampy place, a
few days since, were arrested by a low, faint moaning,
or kind of grunting. They at first took it to be a wild
animal of some kind, but on proceeding to the spot,
| found a man nearly naked, lying in the mud and water,
stupid, senseless and nearly lifeless. They found upon
examination, from appearances, that he had been lying
there for several days, and that he had eaten off* the ends
of the fore and middle fingers of each hand, and gnawed
all his fingers until they were raw! Mr. Frail found
his name to be Mays—that be was a laborer, and from
excessive use of ardent spirits had fullen into a state of
mania a potu, and in this dreadful state of mind had left
the city on Thursday—falling in the swamp, probably,
on the evening of that day, where he lay until found on
the Saturday evening following. But for his timely dis
covery, and the benevolence of the gentlemen above men
tioned, (his poor, miserable being would have died in the
swamp, the victim of his own unhappy appetites and
excesses.—Arkansas Banner.
Flood on Niauara River.—A letter dated Buffalo,
3d inst., says :—An extraordinary excitement has pre
vailed at Queenston arid Lewiston for the last three days.
The ice has disappeared from here with great rapidity.
Such have been its movements over the Niagara Fulls,
accompanied with a strong north wind, that the Niaga
ra River has been completely blocked up. The ice
there yesterday, within a mile of the Falls, was “forty
feet high!” In the rapid course of the ice, every thing
on the wharves at Queenston and Lewiston has been
swept off, with the contents of the store houses. At
Youngstown, it has cleared off every house near the
wharves, and the steam flour mill has gone with it, with
some eighty barrels of flour and a large lot of potash in
the store there. The damage, all round, is not far
from $100,000.
Plank Roads in Canada.—The experiment of plank
ing public roads has been successful in an eminent de
gree in Canada. One between London and Pori J
Stanley, 30 miles long, is already finished, and anoth
er, now constructing between Port Dover and Hamil
ton, 50 miles long, and still a third between London and
Hamilton, 80 miles in extent, are now under contract.
They are laid for double and single tracks:—the ex
pense of the former being $4000, and the latter $3000
per mile.—The roads already constructed are expected
to last ten years. Why do not some of the people of
the "states'’ try the ex|ieriment, or test the matter in
some form in our Atlantic cities 1
Treasure Hunters.—We have heretofore noticed a
company formed at Baltimore, with diving bells and
apparatus, bound to the Spanish main to fish up two
millions of dollars, sunk some thirty years ago in a
Spanish man-of war, called the San Pedro. Tliey have
got up an anchor, a cannon, and several dollars, which
looks very much as if they had struck the mine. The
San Pedro was blown up from accident in her maga
zine. Stock in consequence has gone up from $100 to
$1000 a share.
Curious Discovery.—A highly curious and interest
ing discovery, not only to the geologist, but others like
wise, has just been made at the Peulwyn iron-works,
near Pontypool. While the workmen engaged on those
works, and occupied in one of the mine levels, were pro
ceeding with their operations, they met with a fossil
| iree of very considerable size. It was found in an erect
| position and perpendicular to the plane of stratification.
| The circumference at the base, immediately above the
| joint junction with the root, is six feet, and from thence
I it diminishes to four feet, in a height of about five feet.
Mineral Resources of Alabama.—Iu Randolph
county (Ala.) there are five large mines of silver and
gold, and several minor ones, which produce annually
about $125,000, and afford employment to 2 or 300 per
sons. Tallapoosa county, is also rich in gold and sil
] vaunines—Goldville is supported by one mine. Gold
lias also been found in Coosa, Talladega, and Cham
I bers counties. In Randolph there is an inexhaustible
j bed of Iron ore, which does not lose 15 per cent in melt
ing. Nitre, Coal, Salt and Lead ore are found in other
counties.
I
| Naval Movements—Rumors have been current for

j inst. that orders had been given for a concentration of
J naval force in the Gulf of Mexico; that the Princeton’s

A North Carolina Boy.—The Raleigh Register no
tices a boy, eight years old, who weighs one hundred
and eighty pounds, more than Daniel Lambert weighed
at the same age. He is four feet eight and a half in
ches high.—His name is Jasper Jackson, is the son of
poor parents, and a native of Orange connty. He is to
be exhibited as a prodigy.
From Texas by way op the Red RivER.-^The Red
River Republican learns from gentlemen dmet from
Texas, that the most populous settlements through which
jhey passed were in a fever of joy at the passage of the
Annexation resolutions. When the news reached San
Augustine, cannon were fired and public meetings were
held in celebration of the event.—N. O. Pic. ilk inst.
Wrecx or the Steamboat Swallow.—She struck a

rending. Several lives were lost, but the number is not
given.
The Mormons.—The Warsaw Signal states that
most of the friends of Rigdon, who still remain in Nau
voo, have been despoiled of their property, and live in
constant fear of their lives. One of these, Elder Marks,
a man of wealth, fled from that city last week in the
