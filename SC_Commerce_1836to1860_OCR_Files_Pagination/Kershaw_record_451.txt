MESSAGE.
From the President of the United States
to the two Houses of Congress, at the
commencement of the Second Session
of the Twenty-Sixth Congress.
Fellow citizens of the Senate
and House of Representatives:
Our devout gratitude is due to the Su- 1
premc Being for having graciously con- '
tinued to our beloved country, through 1
the vicissitudes of another year, the inva-,1
Juable blessings of health, plenty and 1
peace.?Seldom has this favored laud 1
been so generally exempted from the ra-t i
n ! InUrtti r\F i|.n l>t i -? <
vages 01 uisease, or uiu mum ?ji mu unhand
man more amply rewarded; and never
before have our relations with other 1
countries been placed on a more favora- '
ble basis than that which they so happily '
occupy at this critical conjuncture in the 1
affairs of the world. A rigid persever- 1
ing abstinence from all interference with
the domestic and political relations of <
other States, alike due to the genius and 1
distinctive character of our Government, 1
and to the principles by which it is direct- 1
ed; a faithful observance, in the manage- 1
ment of our foreign relations, of the prac- 1
tice of speaking plainly, dealing justly,
and requiring truth and justice in return (
as the best conservatives of the peace of 1
nations, a strict impartiality in our mani- 1
festations of friendship, in the commcr
cial privileges we concede, and those we >
require from others: these, accompanied I
by a disposition as prompt to maintain, in '
every emergency, our own rights, as we *
are from principle averse to the invasion (
of those of others, have given to ourp
country and Government a standing in 1
the great family of nations, of which we 1
have just cause to be proud, and the ad- J
vantages of which are experienced by our >
Citizens throughout every portion of the '
earth to which their enterprising and ad- 1
venturous spirit may carry them. Few,
if any, remain insensible to the value of '
our friendship, or ignorant of the terms '
on which it can be acquired, and by <
which it can alone be preserved. 1
A series of questions of long standing, 1
difficult in their adjustment, and impor- J
tant in their consequences, in which the
rights of our citizens and the honor of
the country were deeply involved, have, (
in the course of a few years, (the most ;
of them during the successful administra- i
.tion of my immediate predecessor,) been 1
brought to a satisfactory conclusion; and >
the most important of those remaining (
are, I am happy to believe, in a fair way '
of being speedily and satisfactorily ad- 1
ju ded. .
With all the powers of the world our
relations are those of honorable peace.?
Since your adjournment, nothing serious
has occurred to interrupt or threaten this
desirable harmony. Jf clouds have lowered
above the other hemisphere, they
have not cast their portentous shadows
upon our happy shores. Bound by no
entangling alliances, yet linked bv a common
nature and interest with the other
nations of mankind, our aspirations are
for the preservation of peace, in whose
. solid and civilizing triumphs all may participate
with a generous emulation. Yet
it behooves us to be prepared for any
event, and to be al?ays ready to maintain
those iust and enlightened principles
of national intercourse, for which this
Government has ever contended. In the
shock of contending empires, it is only
bv assuming a resolute bearing, and
clothing themselves with defensive armor,
hut neutral nations can maintain their in
dependent rights.
The excitement which grew out of the
territorial controversy between the United
States and Great Britain having in a
great measure subsided, it is hoped that a
favorable period is approaching for its final
settlement. Both Governments must
now be convinced of the dangers with
which the question is fraught; and it must
be their desire, as it is their interest, that
this perpetual cause of irritation should
be removed as speedily as practicable.?
In my last annual message you were in
formed that the proposition for a commis- y
sion of exploration and survey promised tl
by Great Britain had been received, and y
that a "fcounterproject, including also a e
provision for the certain and final adjustment
of the limits in dispute, was then e
before the British Government for its n
consideration. The answer of that Gov- a
ernment, accompanied by additional pro- o:
positions of its own, was received, v
through its minister here, since your se- c<
paration. These were promptly consid- v
cred; such as were deemed correct in b
principle, and consistent with a due regard
to the just rights of the United States t(
and of the State of Maine, concurred in; ei
and the reasons for dissenting from the re- tl
sidue, with an additional suggestion on n
our part, communicated by the Secreta- 1
ry of State to Mr. Fox. That minister, a
not feeling himself sufficiently instructed o
upon some of the points raised in the dis- cl
cussion,felt it to be his duty to refer the matter
toihis own Government for its further si
decision. Having now been for some L
*' -x? ? J? O ? ? U
lime unaer us auYisemeiu, * an- u<
swer may be confidently expected. From tc
the character of the points still in differ- rr
ence, and the undoubted disposition of w
both parties to bring the matter to an t!
early conclusion, I look with entire confi- fr
deuce to a prompt and satisfactory ter- c<
mination of the negotiation. Three com- la
missioners were appointed shortly after tl
the adjournment of Congress, under the tl
act of the last session providing for the ta

exploration ana survey 01 me hub which m
separates the States of Maine and New th
Hampshire from the British Provinces; m
Lhoy have been actively employed until pi
their progress was interrupted by the in- d<
clemency of the season, and will resume
their labors as soon as practicable in the fii
ensuing year. bt
It is understood that their respective ap
examinations will throw new light upon ot
the subjecr in controversy, and serve to p(
remove.any erroneous impressions which Si
may have been made elsewhere prcjudi- A
cial to the rights of the U. States. It was be
among other reasons, withaviewrof pre- pi
renting the embarrassments which, in |k
cur peculiar system of government, im- e*
pede and complicate negotiations invol- pi
ring the territorial rights of a State, that cs
[ thought it my duty, as you have been Si
informed on a previous occasion, to pro- cf
pose to the British Government, thiough cc
its minister at Washington, that early re
steps should be taken to adjust the points in

y power, in conformity with the seventh ac
irticle of the treaty of Ghent. No an- vt
?wer has yet been returned by the British N
Government to this proposition. th
With Austria, France, Prussia, Rus- it.*
sia, and ^the remaining Powers of Eu- th
rope, I am happy to inform you our rela- of
tions continue to be of the most friendly ge
character. With Belgium, a treaty of tu
commerce and navigation, based upon ej
liberal principles of reciprocity and cqua- n(
lity, was concluded in March last, and, d<
having been ratified by the Belgian Gov- m
ernment, will be duly laid before the Sen- w
ate. It is a subject of congratulation that ai
it provides for the satisfactory adjustment vi
of a long standing question of controver- in
sv; thus removing the only obstacle which | ai
could obstruct the friendly and mutually
advantageous intercourse between the te
two nations. A messenger has been des- pt
patched with the Hanoverian treaty to th
Berlin, where, according to stipulation, 01
the ratifications are to be exchanged. I re
am happy to announce to you that, after li<
many delays and difficulties, a treaty of to
commerce and navigation, between the se
United States and Portugal, was conclu- ci
ded and signed at Lisbon, on the 26th of ai
August last, by the plenipoteniiaries of re
the two Governments. Its stipulations ui
are founded upon those principles of mu- m
tual liberality and advantage which the fo
United States have always sought to
make the basis of their intercourse with th
foreign Powers, and it is hoped they will w
tend to foster and strengthen the com- si
mercial intercourse of the two countries, oi
Under the appropriation of the last scs- ri

The commissioners appointed under T
the convention for the adjustment of k(
the claims of citizens of the United States ot
upon Mexico having met and organized al
at Washington, in August last, the pa- tli
pers in the possession of the Government, tli
relating to tnose claims, were comunica- w
ted to the board. The claims not cm- n<
braced by that convention are now the bi
subject of negotiation between the two ol
Governments, through the medium of our
minister at Mexico. to
Nothing has occurred to disturb the in
harmony of our relations with the differ- di
ent Governments of South America. I in
regret, however, to bo obliged to inform pi
: # ; - r..i: <i
ou that the claims of our citizensiupon ,
le late Republic of Colombia have, not
et been satisfied by the separate Govrnments
into which it has been resolved.

It affords me pleasure to communicate :
) you that the Government of Chili has
atered into an agreement to indemnify <
jc claimants inlhe case of the Nlacedo- j
ian, for American property, seized in
819; and to add, that information has 1
Iso been received which justifies the hope i
f an early adjustment of the remaining I
laims upon that Government.
The commissioners appointed in pUr- 1
lance of the conversion between the .1
Fnited .States and Texas, for making the ]
oundary between them, have, according i
> the best report received from our com- <
tissioncr, surveyed and established the <
rhole extent of the boundary north along <
re western bank of the Sabine river, j
om its entrance into the Gulf of Mexi- 1
>to the thirty-second degree of north I
titude. The commission, adjourned on 1
re ICtlr of June ia.-.t. i< -a reassemble on <
ic 1st November, for tire purpose: of es- 1
bliihing accurately the intersection of t
io thirtv-second decree of latitude with 1
f r?
ie western bank, of the Sabine, and the j
eridian line thence to Red river. It is i
esumed that the wojk will be conclu- r

When I entered upon the discharge of t
y official duties in March, 1837, the J t
:t for the distribution of the surplus re-1?
;nue was in a course of rapid execution. ;^
early twenty-eight millions of dollars of ?
e public moneys were, in pursuance of f
5 provisions, deposited with the States in (
e months of January, April, and July,|(
* that year. In may there occurred a (
;neral suspension of sjiocie payments (
fthc banks, including, with very, few ,
cceptions, those in which the public mo- ,
lys were deposited, and upon whose fi- r
3lity the Government had unfortunately f
ade itself dependent for the revenues (
hich had been collected from the people, j
id were indispensable to the public ser-' j
ce. This suspension, and the excesses .
banking and commerce out of which it i,
ose, and which were greatly agravated (
/ its occurrence, made, to a great ex- (
nt, unavailable the principal part of the1,
lblic money then on hand; suspended j
e collection of many millions accruing j
l merchants' bonds; and greatly reduced .
venue arising from customs and the pub- <
: lands. These effects have continued ,
operate, iti various decrees, to the pre- j
int period: und. in addition to' the de-'f
ease in tl??* revenue 'IniS-produced, two ]
id a half millions ol duties have been ,
ilinquished by two biennial reductions ,
ider the act "of 1833, and probably as t
uch more upon the importation of iron ,
ar railroads, by special legislation. "" lj
Whilst sucli has been our condition for:,
ie last four years in relation to revenue, {
e have, during the same period, been ]
ibjected to an unavoidable continuance j
* large extraordinary expenses n'Gcessa- <
ly growing out of past transactions, and j
hich could not bo immediately arrested (
ithout great prejudice to.the pubjjc in- (
rest, Of these, the charge upon the (
reasury, inconsequence of tho Chcro- \
ie treaty alone, without adverting to (
hers arising out <it Indian treaties, has j
ready exceeded five millions of dollais; (
latfor the prosecution of measures for ,
ie removal - f die Seminole Indians, ^
hich were found' in progress, has been t
iarly fourteen millions; and the public f
jildings have required the unusual sum (
1" nearly three millions.
It affords me, however, great pleasure s
> be able to say, that trom the com- ?
lencement of this period to the present ?
ly, every demand upon the Govern- (
icnt, at home or abroad, has been (
'omptly met. This has been done, not ,
-4 - ^
only without creating a permanent del:
?if a resort to additional taxation in an
form, but in the midst of a steadily pr<
gressive reduction of; existing burdei
upon the people, leaving still a conside.
able balance of available funds which wi
remain in the Treasury at the end of tli
year. The smith amount- ?f TreasnT
notes, not exceeding four and a half mi
lions of dollars, still outstanding, an
less by twenty-three millions than th
United States have in deposite with tli
States is composed of such only as ar
not yet due, or have not been presente
for payment. They may be redeeme
out of the accruing revenue, if the ej
penditures do not exceed the amour
within,which they may, it is thought, b
kept without prejudice to the public iotei
est, and the revenue shall pro\e to be a
large as may justly be anticipated.
Among the reflections arising from th
contemplations of these circumstances
one, not the least gratifying, is the cour
sciousness that the Government had th
resolution and the ability to adhere, ii
every emergency, to the sacred obligation
nf law; to execute all its contracts accoi
Jin<? to the rcauirements of the constitu
lion; and thus to present, when mos
leedcd, a rallying-point by which tht
msiness of the wiiole country might b
wrought back to a safe and unvarying
standard?a result vitally important a
well as to the interests as to the morals o
he people. There can surely now bi
io difference of opinion in regard to th<
ncalculablc evils that would have arisei
f the Government, at that critical mo
nent, had suffered itself to be deterrei
iom upholding the only true standard o:
falue, either by the pressure of adversi
jircumstances or the'violence of unmeri
ed denunciation. The manner in wliicl
lrt? npnnlp sncfainnr? thp nprfnrmnnne o
h'rs duty was highly honorable to theii
ayrtitude and patriotism. It cannot fail tc
timulate their agents to. adhere, undej
il| circumstances, to the line of duty
ind to satisfy them of the safety wit!
nidi a course really right, arid deman
Igd by a financial crisis,, may, in a com
nynity like ours, be pursued, howevei
ipparently severe its immediate opera
iqn.
tThe policy of the Federal Govern
nent, in extinguishing as -rapidly as pos
nblc the national debt, and, subsequently
h resisting every temptation to create t
tew one, deserves to be regarded in th<
fane favorable light. Among the man]
Ejections to a national debt, the certah
endcncy of public securities to concen
rate ultimately in the coffers of foreigi
itockholders, is one which is every da]
leathering strength. Already have the re
.ources of many of the States, and thi
uture industry of their citizens, been in

>f twelve millions annually, to pay th<
constantly accuring interest on borrower
noney?a sum exceeding half the ordina
y revenues of the whole United States
The pretext which this relation afford31<
breigners to scrutinize the managerr en
)f our domestic affairs, if not actually t<
ntermeddle with them, presents a subjec
or earnest attention, not to say of senou
ilarm. Fortunately, the Federal Govern
nent, with the exception of an obligatioi
entered into in behalf of the District 0
Columbia, which must soon be dischar
*ed, is wholly exempt from any such em
Darrassment. It is also, as is believed
:he only Government which having fulh
ind faithfully paid all its creditors, has ai
io relieved itself entirely from debt. T<
maintain a distinction so desirable, and s<
lonorable to our national character
ihould be an object of earnest solicitude
Never should a free people, if it be pos
jible to avoid it, expose themselves to thi
lecessity of having to treat of the peace
;he honor, or the safety of the Republic
with the Governments of foreign iredi
:ors, who, however well disposed the;
may be to cultivate with us in genera
riendly relations, arc nevertheless, by thi
aw of their own condition, made hostili
fo the success and permanency of politi
:al institutions like oure. Most humilia
;ihg may be the embarrassmenfs conse
juent upon such a condition. Anothc
objection, scarcely less formidable, to th<
jommenceraent of a new debt, is its inc
citable tendency to increase in magnitude
md to fo3ier national extravagance. H(
las been an unprofitable observer e

it. and by the selfish importunities of appHiv
cants lor appropriations "for" works avow5
edly f>r tlie accommodation of the public,
is but the real objects of which arc, too ^
r- frequently, the advancement of private
ill interest?. The known necessity which so .
ie many of the Slates will be under to imV
pose taxes for the payment of the interest
j. on their debts, furnishes ,an additional and
d very cogent reason why the Federal Goie
vernment should refrain from creating a
ie national debt, by which the people would
t3 be exposed to double taxation for a simid
lar object. We possess within ourselves
d ample resources for every emergency;
and we may be quite sure that our citiit
zens, in no future exigency, will pe un
willing to supply the Government with ail
v the means asked for the defence of , the '
is. country. In time of peace there can, at
all events, be no justification for the crea- 1
e tion of a permanent debt by the Fedenil
3. Government. Its limited range of coni
stitutional duties may certainly, under
e such circumstances, be performed withn
out such a resort. It lias, it is seen, been
s avoided during four yearsof greater.fiscal y

j But, to accomplish so desirable-an ofc- i *
s ject, two things are indispensable: first, ;
f that the action of the Federal ?ovefn??
ment be kept within the boundaries pte-d
2 scribed by its founders; and secondly, p
i that all appropriations for objects adopt- 4
. ted to be constitutional, and the expend!- '
i ture of them also, be subjected to a stah.-^
f dard of rigid but well-considered' apd ^
> practical economy. The first depends 1,'
- chiefly on the people theipselves, the opin- ,
i ions they form of the true construction of .
f theconstution, and the confidence they .,
r repose in the political sentiments of those >
) they select as their representatives, in the >
r Federal Legislature; the second rest upon j
; the fidelity with which their more imrnedi*
i ate representatives, and other public
- functionaries, discharge the tresis'coat* ^
. mitted to them. The duty of economic*
r zing the expenses of the public service it *
. admitted on all hands; yet there are few
subjects upon which there exists a wider
. difference of opjjniqn than is constantly
- manifested in regard to the fidelity with
, which that duty is discharged. -Neither
i diversity of sentiment, nor even mutual
> recriminations, upon a point in respect to
j which the public mind is so justly sena-, .

- least, so at periods of great political ex-.,'
i citements. An intelligent people, howf
ever, seldom-fail to arrive, in the end, at
correct conclusions in such a matter.?..
3 Prastical economy in the management of
. public affairs can have no adverse infiof
ence to contend with more powerful than
t a large revenue; and unusually laige ap3
propriations for 1837 may, without doubt, *
1 independently of the extraordinary reqiusi-'
. tions for the public service growing out Of
. the state of our Indian relations, be, in*
> no inconsiderable degree, traced to thist
source. The sudden and rapid distribij)
tipn of the large surplus then in the Treat
sury, and the equally sudden and unpre^
s cedentedly severe revulsion ip the com-'

ting with unerring certainty to 9 great and'
f protracted reduction of the Revenue,
. strengthened the propriety of the earliest
. practicable reduction of the public expend
I, ditures. . <
' But, to change a system opening upon
" so large a surface, and applicable to such
3 numerous and diversified interests and ob0
jects, was more than the work of a day.
V The attention of every department of the
Government was immediately, and in good
. faith, directed to that end; and has been
? so continued to the present moment. The
, estimates and appropriations fqr the year
^ 1S38 (the first over which I had control,)
. were somewhat diminished. Theexpen.
ditures of 1839 were reduced six millions
1 ot dollars. Those of 1840, exciusire of
disbursements for public debt and trust
claims will probably not exceed twenty5
two and a half millions; being between
two and three millions; less than those of
" the preceeding year and nine or ten mil"
lions less than those of* 1837. * Nor has it

. which postponement terminated sometime
since, at the moment the Treasury
, Department, by further receipts from the

. its ability to meet them without prejudice

Causes arc in operation which will, it is
believed, justify a still further rcductiou,
without injury to any important national
intcicst. The expenses of sustaining the
