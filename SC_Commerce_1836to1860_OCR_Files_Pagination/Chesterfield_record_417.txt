Auxilary ciops must bo'cultivated to keep the
soil i i heart." and as a resource when. l?y any
of thos? commercial revolutions, the stapls fii's
log ve its ripoctod return. Stock, grain hemp,
tobacco, or oolion, should be the maiu crop for
the soil adapted to each: but neither should be
produced to tho destruction of thatsoil. Rotation
should not be forgotten, nor manure omitted.
The preservation of the soil, peenniaty profit and
moral tendency of hjf labors should be regarded
by every farmer. Tho make-or-brake system
rnpy suit the gambling speculator, but it comports
no with the cahn, prudent perseverance whiot
agricultaic requires.
The principlepn wh'ch important resuUs do.
pend, are hnt simple plain ideas. Nothing has
contributed more to delay Improvement in our
live slock, aud to produce failures in fino stock
speculations, than the singular notion?which
few will admit, but toomanv cci upon?that all
imported stock, or the ?JF*pring of imported
I -tock, without regard to points or care- in rear. I
j ing or keeping, will iring the high prices asked
1.for that, of unexceptionable form, bred with the j
; greatest skill and care, from parents receiving i
! througii a long line ofancestors, desirable forms
and characters, and roared with unceasing care
- for a perfect development of their ancostral
trails. Of the hundreds of horses annually bred !
in the United States, how many are G*ay Eng.
it-ii, Wagoners, Bostons, Henrys, or Eclipses ?
Few onongh?therefore these fjw are immensely
prized. Every bull is not a Comet or a Favorite,
When these rarities do result from superior skill
and attention, they arc the more valuable. The
unsuccessful attempts to breed such animals, are
not wholly lost, they go to tho improvement of
the raco or tho si ud in general. But these at j
tempts require an unusual amount of capital, extra
at'entiog and skill; which the product wou d
not always warrant for ordinary uses. The
! breeder of tlie perfect animal values him as an
| instrument by which his perfection may bo imi
pressed on Ins wholsraceor variety. The an'
certainty and cost of producing a perfect animal
' should not deter the fanner from approximating !
i perfection by tho means wholly in his power,
i Though he may pay one or two hundred dollars
for a boar:This is not throwing away money, for
by selecting his best sows, in one year he may
j hufKA stock of hogs which in olie fourth frss .

greater weighd dooblo his protnnfits. Nene of
this offspring may be equal to the costly parent
but perseverance in a prudent use of such means
will ultimately bring the wholo stock very near
standard. 1
Important, however, as perfect progenitors
are to this-improvement there is one I'ihur re. I
qujsite without which tlicy are comparatively un. 1
availing.?.Brood stock .can never bo so perfect
as that the farmer may dispense with proper at.
tention to their w.ants. There is no such thing
as good cattle without food, and that in abundance

stock can be profitable- without abundance
of food and nec?Jesary protection .from the incle- i

Memorandum of fails staled by JT. B. Smith,
Esq. Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce
of Manchester, before a Committee
of the House of Commons, July 27 1840.
Mr. Smiih stated that the number of persons '
and their families directly ard indirectly, re- s
ceiving their support from the roamifacture of ?
Cotton in Greai Britain, is not less than two ,
millions, aod that the quantity manufactured
in 1838 wa? 312,000,000 lbs.?of which about ^
one third was made into yarns and the resi- 1
due into cotton goods. '
That the increase in the cotlon trade with s
all the world, from 1828 to IMS, hid been ?
percent, in the export of manffatthred good
and 114 per ce&, tfi yarns; but tfcat within tl
name period there had been nr. actual d
crease in the heme consumption, al hough tl
population had increased, from mtiirai cause
at the rate of lOOOeouls a day. The increai
in the export of twist over that of manufat
turcs, had fieen frofn the inabilty of part"
on the Continent to take British goods and
the same lime to find employment for the
people, in consequence of Rnglrtid refusing
take their corn ai d timber in exchange f
for her manufactures; hut that tie twist fur
ishee employment lor their we ate re, and th
such was the rapid transfer noir. going on
British ca .ital and skill to the Gmtinei
from their cnore profitable employment thrr
that unless a speedy amelioration in the Co
Laws should take place, the whole trade
Russia and -Germany would be? cut ptK J
Germany the operation of the tariffalrcai
prohibits ihe coarser, goods, while tiey e:
pregs a perfect readiness to relax theirsystei
if we will admit their produce.
Within his recollection, the highest ntftnb
of the yarn shipped to Switzerland had bei
8'a and'lB's whereas now as ingn as lit
were exported to that country.
Holland had also become a large custom
for yarns* which wer*? wove into goods, ai

In the last ten years a positive decrease
consumption of British manufacture!* on tl
continent had taken place, although the pop
lation was greatly ex tended, -Ahvrcas the i
crease of exports to all those countries, who
products arc permitted to be imported at re
sonable. duties; is very .remarkable.
The amount ofcot'en manufactures to

South America was ?112.009 ? 1,275,0
Brazil, 924,000" _ J ,(>00,0
United States, - 1,15'),000 which increas
in 1831 to 2,539,(00.
Ii the year *1832 the high tariff was ado
ted?6ince when by the increase of their ov
r.otton fabrics, the trade gradually- fe.l off I
in 1838. it was.only .? 1,265,800, bi-ing a dii
inution in seven years of one half, while t
export to Brazil has increased in nearly
equal ratio, and that country is now our be
customer. .
Mr. Addington, orr minister to Washingfc
gives it as his opinion, that the high lai
would not have been adopted bin for the exit
L'tir.e of the corn laws in England.
Recent letters from the United States e
press a belief that as soon as the. president
