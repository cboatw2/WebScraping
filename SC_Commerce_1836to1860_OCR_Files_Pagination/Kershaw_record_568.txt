(V snid that this feature of the ennstitutior
' . tnust be plucked from it; and there is nt
doubt that an attempt will be made to car
ry into effect the Dictator's will. But wil
t" the whigs ever be able to amend the con
I". stitutiou to that effect? No; never. Tin
people will never consent to it. Rerno.v<
I this preventative power, and a majority
; > in both branches of Congress become ii
^ iact omnipotent; usurpation will follow
usurpation, and the federal legislator!
-v- -will become in fact the tyrant of tin
' countrv. Mow wise were the farmers o
tlie constitution, when they provided
whenever two third
~in?i. -mc
' of both branches shall deem it necessary
shall propose amendments to this rousti
tulion, or, on the application of tin
' legislature* of two thirds of the severn
states, shall call a convention for propo
sing amendmcjtts, which, in either case
.shall be valid to all intense and purpose
-as part of this constitution when ratifiei
by the legislature of the three fourths o
the several states, or by conventions ii
three-fourths thereof, as the one or tin
other mode of ratification may be propos
ed by the Congress." Two thirds o
Congress will never he found to proposi
the amendment contemplated; ami if tw<
thirds can'ever be found in Congress ii

'MR. CLAY'S LETTER.
^WASHINGTON, I4lll Sept., 1841.
Gentlemen?In ihe midst of my pre
parations /or mv departure for my home
- ' - l i? ?r ,i,a ???
1 have received, oy me iimuus ?. i...w k?.,
ilem'-n who have done me-the honor t<
wail upon me, your obliging communion
lion bearing date this day, transmitting t
resolution adopted- at a public meeting
held in Baltimore?-yesterday, by which i
is proposed- to distinguish my expectet
visit to that city by signal public demon
Blrations. I pray yoq gentlemen, am
those thatconsti'Nted that meeting. to accept
my grateful and respectful acknowl
edginenls for this new an.d gratifying proul
of attachment and confidence. I should
embrace, with pleasure, the opportunity
of visiting your city, at this time;
but jaded as I a m by the arduous labors ol
the Session of Congress just closed, and
.sharing with ihe companions of my journey;
an eager anxiety to terminate it without
del ay? i regret that I must postpone s
visit to youi city to some future day.
Jf gentlemen, all has nut be?n accom
pfiehed at the 1 ?to Session i?f Congrest
that the public interest demanded, mure,
much more, has been effected than I ami
cipated at its commencement. If we hav,
been greatly disappointed in the failure ol
repeated attempts to establish a sound
currency, regulate exchanges, and sep.tr.
ate the Purse from the Sw .rd, what Ameri.
can (Citizen, what Whig will, on thai
account, surrender himself to the sentimerits
of" an ignoble despair. Who will
not say that we will preserverc, with re
doubled xoutsge. uam
>; object of the glorious revolution of No,
V em i>?r*Jast. shall he completely consu.nt
mated? Shall we be discouraged because
) one man presumes to set up his itidividu;
a! will against lie will of the nation? On
I the contrary, let us superadd to the previous
duties which we lay under to out
.! country, that of pluckingfrotn the Consti;
luiion this 6ign of arbitary power; this
odious and obsolete vestige of Royal prerogative.
Let us, by a suitable amendment
to that instrument, declare that the Vet.i
?that parent and fruitful source of all our
public ills?shall itself be overruled by
majorities in the two Houses of Congress.
They would persuade us that it is harmi
less because its office is preventive or conI
servative! As if a Nation might not be
, as much injured by the arrest of the enactment
of good laws as by the promulp
gatinn of bad ones!
Iam, gentlemen, greatly deceived, nnt,
witstanding the astounding developments
f recently made, if the Whig cause is nol
, stronger than ever it was. Resting as it
does, upon truth, sound policy, anil enlightened
patriotism, its votaries must be
false and faithless, if it does not gloriously
triumph notwithstanding any temporary
disappointment.
Accept, Gentlemen, assurances ot the
[ high regard and esteem of Your friend
. and ob't serv't, . . H. CLAY.

1 If your Excellency and the Congress
of your stale desire to enter into more permanent

and commerce with the Government and

i Trombone vs. Bull.?The Lafayette
*j (Louisiana) Chronicle, in enumerating the
I variousdifinitions given to the word "gen'
tleman," relates the following anecdote:?
"An intoxicated trombone player was
1 returning from a country ball, and while
crossing a field he was accosted by a bel*!
lowing bull. What with the darkness in
?I the eves of a man who could not have
, J seen straight had it been day light, the
trombone player mistook the bull for a
brother musician, and the bellow for a
f defiance to a trial of skill. Possessed
I aith this idea, he gave a blast on his instrument
that made the welkin ring.'?
The bull taking this as a challenge from
some other hull, advanced towards the
trombone player, and bellowed with great-,
er energy. "You'll have to blow?hie?
blow louder than that, my?hie?my fine
<ello\y}" said the musician; whereupon he
propped himself against the stone wall}
and gave another blast. The enraged bull,:
without more ado,interrupted .the strain
by attacking tbe trombone played in-'*be i
rear, and throwing him over the wall.?
"There,"Jie ejaculated, as he slowly regained
Ifra legs, "you?hie?may beatj
musician, but by gosh you're no gentle-j
i man!"

I Dedication of the New Masonic Hall.?
1 The dedication of the new and elegant j
" Masonic Hall, at the corner of King and
Wentworth streets, in this city, took place
yesterday afternoon, under the auspices
of the Grand Lodge of Ancient Free'
" Masons of South-Carolina, and in the i
1 presence of the brethren of t' e order, and j
a numerous assemblage of citizens of both j
| sexes. The spacious Hall was .crowded
almost to suffocation, and many, like our- i
selves, were compelled to retire from the I
t impracticability of effecting a peaceable :
t entry, we learn that an eloquent nnd ap- (
. propriate address was delivered by the
i Rev. Albert Case, Grand Chaplain of
the Grand Lodge; that several fine an
thems were sung to most admirable music;
and that the ceremonies of dedication
! were imposingly performed, under the:
' direction of the M. W. G..M., Gen. E. H.
Edwards.?Charleston Courier,
The Custom House?Mr. Curtis, the
collector of this port, has, we learn, receiv\:
ed a check in certain proceedings in which (
' j he was engaged.
! Immediately after he had intelligence,
"'that the Senate had confirmed his nornina-f
tion, he began to bestir himself with great
'activity, displacing democrats and puttingi
Iwhigs in their places. While he was!
i tliu* agreeably employed, he recieved an
1 " ? . I'
? intimation troin me new secretary ui uie j
i Treasury that he would be expecied to(
make no more removals for opinion's sake.
The story is that the collector nibbed his
1 eyes, read over the letter two* or three
times, to see whether he had made out its
contents aright, and finding that theie was j
1 no mistake set off immediately for Wash-1
ington, to see what it meant.
Now take a peep at the following:?
_ "Mr Barker, the able Comptroller of i
I the Treasury, appointed by Mr. Van Buren,
has been restored to his place. One
or two instances of the same kind we j
learn have occurred, and it is understood,
that no more removals for opinion's sake
will be allowed to take place."

of bilious Fever, Capt. Benjamin Thomas Elmore,
in the 51st yoar of his age, leaving a bereavod wife,
six children, a whole community, shrouded in
griof. But yesterday, onr friend, whose name is
synonimoufl with all that is honorable, generous,
and just, cheered us by his presence. But yesterday,
his dwelling was the abode of peace and happiness
?to-day, his home is desolate. "The silver cord is
loosed, the golden bowl is broken at the fountain."?
He is gono!?the affectionate husband, the tender
parent, the humano master, tho generous friend.?
He is gone!?the brave soldier, the just citizen, the
faithful public servant. He whose heart was the
abode of every manly virtue, sincere in friendship,
just in dealing, full df honor, has been stricken down
in the meridian of life. Neither the just rospect of
the public, the devoted attachment of his friends,
nor the tender affection of a doating family,' could
save hip from on early grave. While we bow
with devout submission to the will of Him who con.
trols our destinies on . earth, and we humbly trust
will crown our hopes in heaven, Jet us enjoy the

Resolved, That if this Company has acquired any
reputation for military skill, and the spirit which becomes
the soldier, it gratefully acknowledges its
high obligations to the noble impulses and fostering
care of its deeply lamented former Ciiief.
Resolved, That in our departed friend, were found,
fitly blended, generosity of heart, and kindness of
temper, with the soldierly virtues of high honor,
indomitable courage,.unshaken, firmness, and incorruptible
good faith.
Resolved, That in him the State has lost a useful
and virtuous citizen, the Town a prudent and efficient
chief magistrate, and this Company one of its
noblest ornaments.
Resolved, That the customary badge of mourning
be worn by the Company for thirty days; and that a
Copv of these Resolutions be transmitted to tho afflicted
