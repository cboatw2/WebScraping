only asked the reasonable price of 58 per

When we arrived here Gen. Clinch had ~5U
men stationed here?all of them Regulars?
but the next day after we arrived," one corn,

Micanopy, stating that the Indians had kil-1

another, and had also burnt tiie house at j
which we procured corn and fodder, and it j
is the general opinion here that the owner,
has been living on friendly terms with the '

they burnt his house.

JACKSONVILLE, FEB. 25.?Further
llostilities'of the Indians.?By accounts received
from Micanopy, we learn that two
men were fired upon by Indians, within a I
mile of that place. One was killed and !
most shockingly mangled. The particulars !
are contained in the following extract of a J
letter received bv Mr. C. Waldron, dated j
Feb. 17th, 1836.
Yesterday, Isaac Lunin, and Willis 1
Nettles went alter hogs a little below Mr.'

as he was. There have been Indians all'

This new instance of depredations, and
the appearanec of Indians in that quarter,
mayTbc regarded as a manifesto of their
readiness to engage the whites again. It is
the last manifest of theirs. Their triumph
is short.

SAVANXAII, MARCH 3.?Lulcrfrom j
Florida.?By the arrival of the steamboat J
Florida, Capt. Hcbbard, we learn that Gen.
Gaiues had arrived safe at Fort King with I
1 '
1100 men. This intelligence was received^
through an Express, arrived at Picolata j
about two hours before the Florida left. It
is confirned in a letter from Micannopy of
the 23th ult. The force under Gen. (laincs
had not encountered an Indians on their
route from Tampa.
We have been politely furnished with the

St. Augustine March 5. . J
Dear Sir.?I have purposely refrained j
from transmiting you any account of the i
Seminole campaign, as the various contradictory
statements in regard to the move- ;
mcnts of the enemy until within a few days
since, did not deserve notice, and were too ,
brainless to be credited. The simple fact,
however, that St. Augustine, Jacksonville, j
Picolata, Camp King. Tampa and Key I
West, liave been for such a length of time
kept in a constant state of alarm, and each j
momently dreading an attack, is evidence of
talent never before displayed by Indians?
conduct they always did exhibit?but that a
body of fifteen hundred or two thousand
( men, should make such demonstrations, and
such dispositions of their forces, is, like the
massacre of Major Dade?unparalleled.?
We knew that they must be concentrating
on some point, and so the result has proved.
You aro aware that Gen. Gaines approached
within four or five miles of Fort Drane?
took eight days provisions, and returned to
the Outhlacoochc, for the purpose of discovering
whether any Indians were on the
I prowl. On arriving at that stream his passage
was disputed by a body of savages,
amounting, it is surmised, to fifteen hundred?a
fight commenced across the river
"which, although narrow, is deep and rapid
and continued two days, neither party gain
ing any material advantage. The thir
day Gen. Gaines retired, and throw up ;
breast work?after which he advanced t<
the river with two hundred men. rccoin
nienced tlie skiV.ntsh, and then retreatei
with a hope of deceiving his enemy, am
decoying them into an umbu.*h, Afte
dark on the same day, tito entire body o
Indians, now largely re-intbrced by the ar
rival of scatt 'ring squads, crossed the
river, and had the bravery to attack him it
I his trenches. The strutegem was thus fat
! successful?the cannon opened upon them
and played with Such elieCf, that it is presumed,
three hundred Indians and Negroes
were killed. I say presumed, as it is no
known, whether that number was destroyer
in tiie single engagement, or in the entire rencontre.
W lien the cannon opened, the sava.
ges began a "terrible howling,'' and no won
dor, for I am toid that all the /race chains
belonging to the wagons wore used instead ol
bills,& literally mowed them down like gias
beneath the scythe. Two of our otlicers
were wounded in that engagement?one ol
whom, it is understood has since died.
Gaines has since sttit into Clinch for provisions
: but afterwards, countermanded the
order, as the Indians would caj t ire the waggons.
He is understood to be surrounded.
His provisions must begone?and unless a
reinforcement has been sent bv* Scott, his
fate, and that of his gallant army, are sealed.
I was in Camp, between this and Hanson's,
when Prince, the Express came in ;
the Indians having attacked him in true military
style, within eleven miles of this, and
ordered hini to the " right about," with a
shower of fifteen or twenty bullets. The
top of his cap was literally shot away, and
several balls passed through his coat. A
detachment from Lieut. Colonel Hewitt's
lluttalion was on this morning ordered out
to skin tiie country, ami cut up the varlets
" like a group/*
The Fosteript to anotiier letter dated St.
Augustine, March 2.
1\ o. Since writing the above we learn
officially, that Gen. Gaines had been attacked
on the night of the :29th February,
by about loOO Indians as he supposes, and
alter two hours hard lighting he succeeded
in beating them olf. The loss on our side
is 4 killed, and 29 wounded, among the latter
two officers. Gen. Gaines is in a dangerous
situation ; to use his own expression,
' his wounded arc increasing and his horses
decreasing/' I Ie is short of provisions and
entrenched and surrounded by the enemy.

i ed furiously the whole time ; [the storm

ii ing, when the snow had fallen to the depth j
' of about six Inches.]
Tiie streets were almost a light as day, j
n ! and some of the houses presented tin? most j
! beautiful and tasteful illuminations. The!
1 scene at the landing was eminently sublime.
t ' Covington and Newport, particularly the
( i latter, appeared almost in a blaze of li^ght,
! and the banks of the river, were llaming
.! with immense bonfires composed of barrels
w I of tar ?nui other combustible materials.?
Numerous torclies were likewise* to bo seen
