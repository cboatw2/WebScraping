i John Forsyth, Secretary of Stale,
TREASURE-TROVE.
'i We learn that during the last week, a
black man, whilst making some excavations
on a lot of land adjoining town,
claimed by Mr. M. A. Outten, found buried
in the earth a pot containing silver
coip. As no owner could be found for
this treasure, and no one claimed the
same as his property, an inquiry was naturally
made to whom did it belong? The
, law in England on this subject, where it i$
called treasure-trove, (from the French
word trover, to find,) is somewhat cuonrt
mav nr?t he nninterestinor to
AlVSU*?) UllV* $A? MJ law* ......
oar readers. It is there held (hat when
any money or coin, gold, silver, plate or
bullion, is found hidden in the earth, or
other private place, and the owner thereof
is unknown, the treasure belongs to
, the King, but if he that hid it be known
. or afterwards found out, the owner, and
not the King, is entitled to it. If it be
found in the sea, or upon the earth, it doth
| not belong to the King, but the finder, if
t no owner appears. So that it seems it is
. the hiding, and not the abandoning of it
. that gives the King a property. This disi
linction arises from the intention of the
. original owner; for a man who hides his
: treasure in a secret place, evidently does
i not intend to abandon it, but reserves a
r right of claiming it again when he sees fit,
I and if he dies and the secret dies with
him, the law give? if to the King in part
; of his royal revenue. But if a man scatters
his treasure into the sea or upon the
surface of the earth, he is construed to
have absolutely abandoned his property
i and returned it into the common stock,
" without any intention of reclaiming it.
and therefore, it belongs, as in a state of
nature, to the first occupant or finder, unless
the owner appear and assert his right,
which then proves that the loss was by
accident and not with an intent to renounce
his property. This rule prevails
' in Germany, England, France, Spain and
Denmark, This rule, which is now almost
universal, grew out of a state of
facts, produced by the Roman conquests;
for when the Romans were afterwards
driven out by these northern nations, they
concealed their money underground, with
a view of resorting to it again when the
heat of the eruption should be over, and:
the invaders driven back to their deserts.
But as this never happened, the tr6asyres

were never claimed, and on the death of;
the owners the secret also died with them.; :
The punishment for ocmeealing : the-folding
of hidden treasure was fbrmefly no
less than death, but nov? jt is fin'e'dnd'ini- imprisonment:
This is the rule in England.
and it is argued here, that as hidden trea- /
sure or treasure-trove titersbelongs to theKing,
here it. must belong to the sovereign, ^
ivhich is the State. "VVc understand tnat^.
