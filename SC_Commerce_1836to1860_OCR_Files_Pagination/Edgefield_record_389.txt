.A lecture delivered before io. Edgefield
Philosopical and Agricultural Society
of Edgefield, 6n the subject of "Ve-eta
ble Phy-siology," by.J.As. .Ti,:ntty, Esq.
on the lst. Juue,lI0, and published by
request of the Society.
Thle. present isan age of practical philoso
phy; am-age in-which our race are wore engag
-ed in deducing froin actual experiments, useful
improvements in the arts, than in establishing
splendid theories on merely plausible hypothe
.ses. In this respcc t, our own country has ad'
vanced more rapidly perhaps than any other;
not on account of supeior powers ofphlosoph1i
cal research, but because our- institutions of
government afford to its citizens the most un
limited scope for practical industry, and..pwom
ise the most generous rewards to success in
#every department of mechanical, commercial,
and agricultural enterprize.
It is a common error I fear, that the-sentence
of the Almighty upon our race, -In the sweat
df thy face thou shalt eat bread" is calculated to
impress upon the pursuit of agrictdture the
stamp of inferiority, when compared with oth
eremployments. But in alludingto this error,
we are reminded that the tilling of the earth is
..a pursuit of divine appointment; is the most an
--cient ofall pursuits; and as I firmly believe, a
purauit most happily illustrating the wiseom and
-goodness of that Being from whom coIeth
every blessig.
'The cultivation of the soil is the primary
source from which all clasaes of civilized ien
'derive their snb*istence; and the products of
the earth, whether they be spontaneous, or the
reward of man's industry and-sl--il, either di.
rectly or indirectly, furnish suibsistauce 4o the'
whole animal kingdom: for whethei the animal
be omnivorous, carnivorous, or graininivorous,
the earth, the great. mother of all vege:ahle
matter, has yielded tihe first frnits, and in the
language of an inspired Iman, all flesh is grass.
It may therefore be emphatically said of the
vegetable kingdom that, as it is the inexhausti
ble store house frmzn which all animated nature
draw their supplies, so is it the most important
field for philosophical enquiry in reference to
the means of supplyhip.the wants, and coui
tributing to the wealth and lhwery. of man.
As.a member of a comutmaiity.whoare be
-ginning to appreciate the value of agricultural
knowledge, I feel pronud that the people of our
State are becoming daily more interested in the
-establishment of Societies, and the ditrnsing of
correct infurmation through the medinm of
papers and periodicals. The day is not far lis.
tant, when S. Carolina IuIIt,:im a great mens
ure, abandon .the prodigal culture of her great
staple, cotton, and turn her atttention to the
more frugal but less lucrative business of farm
Jug. As a preliminary step to this change of
pursuit, and diversion of capital into compar
atively new channels, it is of the last impot.
tance that those who live by the cultivation of
-the soil, should feel prouti oftihe employment
-for its own sake, and that they should ttnch to
the science of agriculture eiual consequence,
and regard it as a busiues.s of equal dignity and
honor with what are usually styled the learned
professions of law and medicine. This object,
the consumnation of which isso devoutly to be
wished; can only be accomplished by introdu
ACing thescience of Agriculture into our schools
and colleges by elementary books, illustrated
and enforced by lectures from scientific men;
and thuselevating itto its proper rank, by plac
ing it in company with the sciences of chemis.
.ty and geology, its twin sisters.
- The purpose of the Thiloropical Sccety of.
Edgeficld -in its original formation, was not,I
apprehend confined to thme intvestigation of those
branchesof science embraced in the definiion
gfmental philosophay or metaphysics; but it wvas
-intended to comprehendi~ the cultivation of an~ ac
quaintance,with those arts and sciencesin which
as individuals atnd commntities, we are every
day concerned. With the viewn thcrefore of
aecognizimg the principle of egnqitymi, and of
acknowledgiwr the high claims which the
sudy of the laws, anid dhe itnvestmaation of the
phenomena of the vegetable kingdom, have up
on those engaged in the acqtmsition of useful
knowledge; our society has resolved so to chantge
kts name, as expressly to emubrace in its objects,
the science of Agriculture, and has assigned for
this evenings lecture, the subject of 'vegetable
physio'ogy."
.In discussing a subject so vast and coinpro
lIensive in .its relatiuus, and so imuportatnt and
umakifarions in its results, nothing more can be
attemplted in a single lecture, than a brief nto
tice ofsome of the ma.st promient facts, and a
concise illustratio:i of some of the most obviouts
principlesof the science.,
Physiologists have assigned -to the vege~tahle
kingdom the second rank in the scale of ob
jects composing the material universe. T1he
line of separation between an animal of the
lowvst, and a plant of the highest order, is so
entall,,.as scarcely to ba appreciable. Both the
ataimal and .vegetable have a prl~inciple of vitali
ty .sustained agd supported by organic ma
chinery, so comlplex, and by chemical chamnges,
andcomnbinations.so intricate and incotmprehen
rible, as to elude the intensest researches of the
profoundest philosophy; and the most that can
be accomphishedbiy theatnatowist and physiolo
gist is, to separato and analyze the several
parts compositng the animal and vegetable struc
ture,andthuts to develops the secret spr-ings and
wheels of this wonderful machinery, without
being able to comprehend or explain the prin.
ciple wicih gives it motion.
In discussing the suigect before ass this eve
ning, the origin of the platt or to speak more
technic-ally, the pirocess of germunation, is the
Girst thing to wvhich I beg leave to direct your
attention. Whatever differeneof opinion may
have existed-in the itnfancy of thme sciece~ of
vecgetable physiology, it is nowv ttniversally ad
mitted that all plantsi sprinig from see-is, though
they may be piropagated by other nmeans such as
granling anid budding. For the purpose of ex
aminming the organic structure of seeds, and il
lustrating the process by wht ich they are chan.
-ed from the etmbryo into the livinig platnt, w~e
will take thme commiton grardeni beatn- Upon in
specting the bean. it wnill be found to consist of
twvo lobes, which are called cotyledons. near the
e-ye of the beau, is a smuall round bodvy which
is the germ of tihe future root of the planm, tnd
lob.-s or cutyledons, is inotler emuall body which
is the germ of the future stem or trunk of the
plaut, and is called the plumula. All seeds
have-the radicile and plumula, whether they
be mono cotyledonous, as indian corntwheatand
other small grains and the whole family ofgrass
es; or whether they be di-cotyledonous, as the
bean and the whole family of legimentous veg
etab!es; and the process of gernuination is coin
mon to the whole vegetable kingdomt. A seed
is said to germinate, when it . undergoes . that
change by which the radicle is converted into
a root and grows downward into the earth, and
the plumitila is- cotverted into the stemin, end
shoots upward, carrying along with it, in the
case of the bean, the two cotyledons, which
.are employed in giving nomeiniint to the in
fint plant, until, fiom the extension of i:s roots,
and the-expmionofits. leaves, it is capable of
receiving food from the soil and the atmosphere.
Itis.a Iact well estiblished, that the changes we
have been de.scribitng never take place itnles.
moisture be present; that they never take place
unless the temperature be above zero, and that
some seeds will germinate in lower tempera
tnres than others; and that they never take place
unless atnospheric air or oxygen gas he )present.
Boyle, Boerlave and 31 uschenbroek proved by
repeated experiments, that seeds will not vege
tate in the vacutm of an air pump; and Scheele
and Achard ascertained by sitnilar experiments
that germination will not take place in nitrogen
gas, hyda ogen gas, or carbonic acid gas,.nnless.
they are in.u state of combination with oxygen.
Light is also said to have a sensible inflnence
on the germinatton of seeds, tho' to what precise
extent, seems not to be well ascertained: it is
certain, however, that it retards the process, ei
ther by some inherent property which it pos
sesses, or by indirect agency, in prodecing a
certain modification of heat and.moisture un
favorable to vetretation.
Thus it appoars .that heat, moistnre and oxy.
gen gvas, are indi.1petsable to tte process of
germiunaion; asit -will hereaftcr H seen that
they are important agents in the further ira
gress of vegetation:
Afterthe processuf germination is compltel,
the plant, tinder favorable circumstances, con
tinues to grow; its roots are increased itt nnm
ber and size; its branclie. miltiply and expand,
;and it is obvions to the senses. thWt.the whole
plantf-l'ot .its rapid increase in brlk, is con
stantly acquiring new accessions of mater: and
as this new matter cannot be prodiced by the
plati itself, it fillows tlat plantcts like anitinals,
require food tnot only for their immediate nour
ishment, but also for the Ipurpose of replacing
those particles of matter which, having become
tnfitted .for nutriment, are thrown: out -by the
excretory veisels.
It was for a lotig time a que.einnamong phys
iologists, whether water did not constitute the
only food necessacry to the sustenance & growth
of 1lants. This idea, whidh sublcrent experi
ments have proved to be erroneons, wasdoubt
less suggested by the fact, that the elements or
compontent parts of water. namely, oxygen and
hydrogen, are uniformnly fouid itn the substance
of plants; but the experiments of Bergman anti
Margmra, have forever exploded a theory. which
it would scem, ne.ver could have been seriously
advocated, except :in the infancy of tle sci
ence. These philosophers proved-that water
is a necessary agent in elaborating the food
of plants, and is the-vehicle in which it is colt
ducted to the roots to 'be absorbed; and those
experiments which misled Van IHelmont, Bon
net, Boyle, Dulamel, Tillet aid others. ieto
the stpposition that water is the sole and prop
er food of pants, were made without a due re
gat d to the fact that. tunless it has ben purified
Iy distillation, it always holds inc soluttion sotte
of .the eleinents whichi ente't into the stabstanice
ot vegetabiles. Withouctt watner, the seed

the principal foocd of vcgetaleIs, thatn 1hat
xygeln gas which is essenttiai! to anmal life, is
the principad lt6:l of ntoia!s.
e. hiave u!rcadly 4eene that air is ntecessary
to the perocess of iegetatiocn; and it has heeni
scertaine'd bcy the expcerimnents of Chem'ttical
Pi'ilcsophers, thtat a large portiont of the car
bonaceouts matter found to exist 'n planits, is
mtbibede from thte attmospchere. Thtree .of the
onstitutentt elemeants ocf atmosphteric air, tname
y, carbonic acid gas. ecxygen,. and m noisture, ate
aid to furmnish food to the plant.
Another source frictm wjhich vegetahics de
rive their enourishmicent, is ite soil in-whimch they
row, cocnsistitig ocf salts, earths, a nd atnimal antd
egetablle stubstaitces in a state of decomuposi
ion. It hais been well ascertained by chte mticial
aalysis. thtat thte same elements that'enter into
he substanice of thte plantt, are also fonntd to be
he princi pal compthoncents of animtal subhstances:
thse aire oexygen, hydrongent, carbconic acid and
tirogett, the latter elemtet beinig discovered
nity in a few vegetables,whilst it is always fonitd
o exist itn thte aiimal ecoomy.
Ilaving seet thtat lalnts ,require food, and
hat they derive it frott thte atmtosphere, and
fromi the soil int whtich they grow; it tematins to
etquire how the fotcd is received; in what focrmt
it is received; and what chemical changes it
undergoes, before it is itn a proper state to he
assimitiated toc thte sutbstnce of the plant. -
In the futrter examintation of our subject, it
will, I thintk, be impossible to witthhold otur as
sent to the truth of the proposition, that thteme is
a most striking analogy between tmny of the or
ganic fiunctiotns of animals atnd those of vegeta
blec,. Thus the roots of the plant petforim thte
ftnctionts of the month, and the leatves perform
the functiotns of thte httus, itt the ancimal econco
umiy; whilst the trtiik or stemi, aitd the liber or in
ner bark, composed of celtilar tissutes or fibronts
tttbesccnstitute the vaescular apcparatus by wheicht
the.circutlationi of the flutids is carried otn, and
throuigh which. the sap of the planit ascends
anid decends, imnparting new life and rigor.
Perhtape tn suibject cotnnected wiith the science
of vegetable physioleogy has beeintmore thoroutgh
y inivestigated, thant the process by which the
planttt receives and assiiiates its foid ; and al
thonghi many cur~iotus aned ititeresting filets have
beene ascertainted by expe-rimenits, yet mutcht is
left in doubht atnd obscurity. It is true beyontd
question,. however, that the food which the
plamut imobihces from the secil, is conducted Iby
water, and is received at the extretmeties of the
roots by a cellular tisstue zesemblinag the sponge,
Irhicli! by an etninenit inirdrn nhtsioaist, i
called the spuogiole of the rout. :The substance
intended for die future nourishment of the
plant is held in solution by water, and in thtit
state, enters the spongiole by a sort of affinity
.-which, inl chemical philosophy, is called capilla
ry attraction; but from the well knowi fact
that the action of this principle is confined with
in very narrow limits, the ascent of the sap from
the extremetics of the roots; through tie trunk,
to the extremeties of the braniches, and into the
leaves,cannot be accunnted for, but upon some
other principle less hbvions, and more difficult to
becomprelicuded. Aware ofthisdifficulty,physi
ologists a.ttempted to account for the-phenome
non. by ascribing it to the pressitte of the at
msphere upon the spongioles; thud forcing- die
sap through the veseels of the plant, upon the
same principle that a colutn of water-is made
to ascend in a tube by the pressure of the at
mosphere upon the external surface of the
water. Thiis notion prevailed ntil it was ex
ploded by Dr. Uales, who ascertined by an in
gettions experiment: thatthe sap of the plant as
cends with a veloeitv suflicient to overeonie the
pressnre of a colnmn oF water 4tfeet'in per
pendicular heiaht; which is niearly-onethird
greater than the force exerted 'hy!the atntos
phere. tht beiig smificient to overcome the
pressure of a column of water of oly Sn f.'et
in perpemlictlar height. The opinion now
genterallv reeived is, that the criculation of1he
-sap is ef'eeted- by tile alternate contraction an'd
-4ilatatinn of the .Pap vessels; but how this con
traction and dilatation take place. so long na
vertables are denied the fiunctions afsensibility
and irritability -nmstI nireheiM, ever remain
a pro1mntd m mystery. 'Tlhatilhe sandoesascnl,
however. and with the force nscrilied - to it by
Dr ii ales.,m hbeetn provedl by ocnllartdemnnstra
-fion limn'ded ot experiment; and it is pretty
well ascertained that it ascen'ds, in theinftmey
of the platm, throtidi tihe pith, an'd in its more
dvanticed-istate, through tite albtrnmn or white
wood, or in enmnon lilrisclogy, the sap of
the tree. itn contradistinction to thie heart. Tie
sap. it i's awcent, undergoes little or no chnaige,
mntil it reaches the leaves of the plant. [Jere,
by means of the porosity of the leaves, it is ex
losed to tie actioni of the atmosphere, and is
said to have a new property imparted to it by
tl.e oxygen of the attumphere; and tius, afler
'ttndergoing certain chenical dhanges at'd com
binatiots in the lkaves, ptecisely authe'venots
blood of animals, ly leintg brought in contact
with tihe air inl the higs becomes oxygenated
aid purified, the sap is fitted for giving nour
ishmetit to, and being assimilated with;- the
protper.sttbstance oftL plaht. But the analogy
between these animal and vegatible functions
does not stop here; foir as the venous blood of
the aitimal, thIus purified by.being -brought iti
contact with air in -the is, is, by -mcains-of
a different set of vessels, conducteil'back to the
ltcart,-thence :to be difinsed through the sys
tem; so the retirning sap-or peculiar juice of
the plant, as it is now cal?*LV, descends iot in
the same vessels through which it ascended, but

portatit functions to perform. lThey not only
elaborate the crude sap absorbed by the roots,
aid prepare it for bd% nsituilated'and inmeor
poiated into the siistnce ofihe platit, htut-they
decompose a portion of the cafbiili acid gas
of the atin-phcre, and retain the carbon a
fond, whi~si the oxygen is disetgaged and
throwni off, to be employed in puitin~tg the at
mosphecre which hats been derior-ated by the
respiramtioni "r aio:nls, anid the comibustiont and
decomposition of' vegetable and animalt~ sub

It is obvious frmi the analogy which it bears
to a simtilar ftietioni in aimtals, that this pro

T1he last funtc:ioni of vegetables which time
will alhar mue ta notice abpiresetnt, is that of
thirowitig off their excrcteentitionts or suiperfiti
otns matter, by excretory vessels, and the pro
cess is called excretioni. W~e see in this as in
all the woniderfulh phienutmetinof vegetationi, that
the varuous and intricate processes in t'he vege

It is the opinioni of sume phtysiologists that the
higher orders of lantts possess miany or all of
of die funtctionis of antimnals, except those of per
ceptioti anid voinntary locomotioti. However
plasibhle tiig ht he the theory which from anal

er of perceptioni, ,ve have nto tmenits of detect
itug etuch a funcemtin: and so ftmr as experitets
have been made, they lead to thme opjposite con
chtsion. It hais bectn acertained by M. Macaire,
that v'egetabiles hiave nto power of discriminaating
~hetweett food that is nutritionsand whmolestome.
amid that which is poisonous or deletcriois.

I is intended to iemedy these evils; and whether
the food be in itself unwholesome, or taken in
stich quantitiesas to gorge the plant, it is car
ried back to the roots,and by them disgorged in
to the adjacent soil.
In the very cursory and necessarily imperfeci
view I have taken of some of the processes
which nature employsin the vegetation of plants;
the reception and elaboration of proper food rot
theit nourishment; the assimilation of so much
or-wtnourislament as may be needrul to thcir
growth and filldeveloipeient; and the excretion
of so much of it as may be either noxious or su.
perfinous; r have pnrposly omitted the classifi.
cation of plants as a branch of science belongig
more particularly to the'depatment of botany.
I have also omitted to n6tice the varions liquid
and solid substances composing the plant,whose
cheiniical combiuations and properties can only
be discovered in die laberatory, as more appro
priately .elonlgivg to the departmeits ofChem
istry and pharmacology. I ain constrained fot
want of time, to pass by withont particularly
noticing those nutritive substatices found in the
prod ncts of vegetibles which afioid to mankind
so large and so, palatable a poriionof theirdaily
subsistatice.
In concltsion d'the subiect, I am conscious
that I may fairly be charged with having tres
passed upon the time and patience ofthis very
respectabloand int.telligent audience4utless some
or the tirinciples attempted to beilhtstrated may
be usefully applied in the prosecution of some
of the various purnits cotnected with the cul
tivation oftho carth. A fe w facts will be briefly
rerapittilated.
If. as ve have secn, a seed w ill tever-vege
tate without air or oxygen gas, and tht it veg
etates bit ittperfectly wliei exposed tothe light,
tl~e planter's first lesson is one, the solution of
which depends upon a knowledge of these facts.
The seed must be buried to avoid :e 4ight. and
yet must tint be turied so deep as whe irncccs
sible to ihe atio:phere.
.gaii, ifthe sap intended for the future nonr
ishment of'tf plant, is abscorbed- only At the ex
tremities ofthe roots, and the ctting f of the
extremities of the rmots or spongioles destroys
their function of absorption, how ereful should
the planter be that his ploughs anl barrows do
tnot wound or destroy these-ssential organsof
vegetahis vitality; and thus hy.an unskilful and
harburons imsbandry, mar the most cheering
pi ospect of n-plentiil harvesr.

WASINtGTON, JUNE 2.
An import ant movement has becen made
in the Senate, on the subtj.et of the bank.
rupt hiw. Indications are very strong
t hat the southern administration Senaton,
will generally oppose the 181h section of
Mr. Walls bill, by which the banlksare in
cluded. Mr. Calhoun expressed a wish
to speak on the subject of this amendiment.
which he said was vital to the bill, and the
hour being late, the Senate adjourned.
He will speak to-day. It is certain that
several other southern administration Sen
ators have determined upon that course.
They are unwillingto give New York, the
great finaucial and commercial advan
sages which will result to her from the
prostration of the southern hanks. The
New Yorkers; -without party distinciions,
are in favor ofincluding the banks, believ
ing that they can stand-the shock.
14 the Huisse. A Waddy Thompson
moved that the hill reported from the com
nit;ee on niihtary afl'airs, for 'raising an
additional.fcrce 6f sitteen hundred men
for the protection-of lorida be .taken up,
and he submitted sundry-conmtunications
from the Secretary of War, showing that
the Indians were in greater orce, and more
ichievous than ever. Mr. Atherton
urged the necessiy of disposing of the sub
treasury bill, ;before any otdror business
wastnken up. Air. Coles ihiormtied the
[louse that there would be opposition to
to Ihe hiil referred to, by Mr..Thompson,
and that it would not pass without Itasch
debate. The motion was los:, as it requf
ed two thirds.
As the-rules were,,it would retquire a
vote of'two-thirds, on '31 ond ays, F ri'ays
and Sat urdays, to take Ip the Sub-Treasu
ry. The eoinmittee of ways and means
and the majority or the flonse, favorable
to the passage of the Sub-Treasury bill,
were determined to push it through, -if
pos;ihcitc,-hefore nny it her business was at.
teuded to. The Whigs, otn the other-hand
were equally resolute in preventing It.
In thu evening se.sion, nt 4 o'clock. the
states were Clleil for resolutions, and ar.
Smith of 3Me., who ftrst got ate ilaor, offer
-ed M r. Athertori's resoiution to chauge'the
ihe rule. It so happens that, this being
resolution day. the tnotion-roid :be made
without the assent oltwo-thirds. 'If it was
not adopted it would go over for aTortnight.
Mr. Sttith necoipaniell his moltion by a
deinanl for the prcvious <piesrion. Tre
mendots excitemet.fol to wed. The Whigs
denouaced iho proceedure as unfair, un
parliamentry, 1!estructive of the rights of
the minority, &c. Before the siting was
over, so bilh was the excitement that all

thority of the Speaker was uttery disre.
garled. The lie passed back and forth,
between nembers, on several occasions,
and every-thing like decency of behavi-our
was outraged. "lThe House was very neal
breakitng up in conftwion, and would have
been, if lows had been struck, which, at
one time, seecied ineviiato.
The resolution passed -yeas 1l9, nays

'une 3.
iJr. -Cdihonn -rpoke about an hour, yes
terday, on the subject of the Bankrupt hill.
He did not profess-to go fidly into the sub
ject, whichi he said, embraced a great va
ricty oftopies, and he intimated that he
might Iave nathiler opiont tinitytto treat tl:e
!iuestion more at 'largc. But ie very dii
tinctly defined his position itt regard to the
matter. lie opposed the hill, as reported
fron the cotmittee, as unconstitutiotial,
because it was nothing but att insolvent
law. lie pointed out the dilrerence be
tweetn ;rn inolvett and a hankrupjit 'law
the foriner being itiended to relieve deb
tras, anid the latter to regulate ira~do. die
would not vote for a mere insotvetdt lew,
such us thce voluntary lill p'ropoised.
.[But opposed as lie was to the bifl, he
was still more htostile to th stu~abstitute of
Mr. W~alh, that embcraced what wvas called~
the volu nta ry systemu and "as liable, on
that aicectunt, to the samte objection which
h~e urg'edl agatinst the bill. It also, emibra
cell wh-Iat wastentomitnatedt the compulsory
systemt, which in thi opiniont, wvas the on
ly constitutional feuture-ini the scheme.
itt this comultsory priocess, which for
med a henkrutpt law,-in -the meaning of
the constitutio-n, wras too oppressice and
tyrannicial1'or adoption in 'his country.
It had once beeni tried by the lawy oil1800,
which was limited to live years, but-aban
duned after anu experimetrnt of two ycars.
Unider this provision, any~ trader, owing a
debt of 5010 dolhetrs would bce tiable to htave
his business arrested. his property put
in commission,anud sacrificed. le wvoutd
be crushced. at once, whereas, if allowed
time, he wvould lie able to wvork tlbrough,
successfully andi honorably. The fltcctua
tions of thie currency to n hieh we are ex
posed, fromn our banking system, rendered
such a tawv peculiarly tunsurtable to thcis
country. liy a sudent comaraction of the
cuirrency, a personit with amnple mieatns is
uable to tmeet his debts. He might, alf
ter a ilte, paty all, acid have a large
scarplus, but this law ruins and destrovs
him at otnce. There -wotuld be much more
propriety in granting~ a stay lawy for his
relief. thun in t hus interposing to hasten
atnd comiplete his rn-in, He dtid not believe
that .a si-ngle Seotue~r would vote hhr his
compitulsory law, stamling by itself; but
tmatny, from anxiety to relieve debtors, or
a dispmosition to ptinnish tthe baniks, would
vocte for it, in contnection with the volunta
ry and corporation provisions.
As to thse kest fcature of the substitute
applying the compulsory prorcess to banks
Mr Calhotin argtted that it wotti he more
ruinous to the cotuntry than a devastating
tornado, or ai decree of Providence sud
denly smiting the earth with sterility.
Tihe blow would nott 'fall on thea corpora

the whole mass of thte comtmunity. A

Pe.rha the banks, in Newv York and

parts of the country. .it would not lie a
iniuorm law. lie did not sp'eak tof mo
tives, but the elleet of the haw upon the
commerce and banking of the South,
would be most disasiious. As a means
o cof'ncentratitng the maiied power of the
country, it would be more effective than
a National Bank. . It would also unite the
banking system -with the Government,
and give the lattcr complete cowtrole over
the former.
In fine, Mr. Calhotn said. lie would veto
to strike out the clause embracing the0
banks. and afterwards against the whole
scheme.
The question was iaken and thelatiks
were stricken out by a decisive vote yea.
28, nays. 16, Mr-. Clay of Keneucky
moved to rollow up this,- by striking out
the 18th section, as including the compdl.
sory systemn. That question will next be
discussed. Mr. Calhoun lias blown up
two parts of the bill, the coipulsory 'and
corporation provissions, But his arge
metit agains.t the voluntary s~stem is ubt
conclusive. However, 1oubt whether,
