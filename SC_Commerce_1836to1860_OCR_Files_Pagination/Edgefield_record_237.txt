We are indebted to the' lion. John C.
Calhoun, for a copy of his Speech on the
Graduation Bill. We will publish it in
our nezt
We publish to day, some extracts from
*The address of the Hon. Chas. Shepard;
of North Carolina, to his countituents."
We regret that we cannot give our teaders
the whole of it. Mr. Shepard gives a frank
snd manly exposition or his political o
pinions, and shows satisfactorily, the re
latiin, iil hich he now stands to the Ad
ministtofi
an.;ration.
New ocking Chair,-A few days'stnce,
we saw for sale at the Hotel of M~r. C. J.
Glover,-ih this place, a Rocking Chair of
a peculiar construction. It was well cush
ioned in the seat, sides and back, and even
had a. cushioned foot-board. It rocked
forward like an ordinary chair, or lateral
ly, resembling in its motion, a Steam Car
tinder'way, on a Rail Road. Thte feet
are fixed on rollers, and the chair could be
easily moved about.
It could be converted at pleasure, into
a sofa, on which the invalid might rest his
aching limbs, or on which thme mnn or busi
neas might lie, after the fatigues of the
day, and think of new commercial opera.
tionsf~or on'which the'gentleman might
recline, and' enjoy what 'the poet. Gray
calls the very perfection of earthly happi
ness-namely the perusal of new novels.
-We at first thought that it would suit us
admirably,. in whicel'to sit, and write our
learned editorial articles, but on sober
second thought, which Mr. Van Buren
says is always 'the safest, we concluded
that it would be better to keep our plain
windsor chair a little longer. This rock-,
ing chair was plain but handsome. The
price was 365. We are informed that all
kinds, froin the plainest to thae most ele
gant, can be purchased in Hamburg.
A hemy~ debt to pay.-We extract the
following from- the Charleston Courier. In
the Court of General Sessions for Charles
ton District, Judge Butler proniounced the
gallo ving seintence:
"The Stat., es. F. Russell-Larceny.
Defendant to .receive thirty-nine, lashes,
at the public whipping post, in instalments,
two of ten and one of nine lashes, on tbe
first Saturdays in March, May and June
next respectively, and to be imprisoned for
three months thereafter.
South Westernt Rail Road Bank.-A
Branch of tiiis Institution has been estab
lished in Knoxville, Tennessee, and D. A.
Deaderick, Esq. appointed Cashier.
Fire in Boston.-Thirty -five btuildings
were destroyed by fire in this city, on the
24th ult. .The loss is estimated at from
fifty to sixty thousand dollars. When the
fire broke' out,-the thermometer stood at
9 degrees below zero.
Fire in Elibabeth City, N. C.-A most
destructive fire broke out at that place, on
the 20th ult. Property amounting to about
38,000 was destroyed.
Mississippi.'-'The Hon. John Hender
sora Whig, b~as'heen elected from this State
to the U. S. Senate, in the plae of R. 3.
iWinkcr reirned..
Jupfler and the 1rogs.-In ancient times,.
there was a community of little people
vulgarly called Frogs. They were pros
perous for a long term of years, and every
famliy was contented. At length some
dissatisfied spirits rose up among them,
and petitioned Jupiter, the King of Gods,
Men and Frogs, for a Ruler over them.
Jupiter was very angry and sent them a
huge Snake for a King. For a time the
Frogs were well pleased with his snaky
Majesty, and he was very gracious to his
subjects. One day, he crushed a little
Frog and swallowed him whole. This
excited but little alarm. The next day, he
swallowed another. The third day he
gulped down two large Frogs at a meal.
The whole'nation were now alarmed.
Meetings were held, and combinations
formed to resist the power of the tyrant.
It was all in vain. He laughed them to
scorn. He went on swallowing Frog ar
ter Frog, until he finally destroyed the
whole nation.
Moral.-Those Banks and States
which have petitioned the Government,
for a supreme United States Bank, may
make the application.
Seizure of Southern Property in British
Ports.-It will be remembered by some
of our readers, that some time since, a cer
tain American vessel was driven by stress
of weather, into a port of the Bermuda
Islands, and that others were wrecked on
the -Bahamas. The negroes on hoard,
who were Southern property, were detain
ed. Mr. Calhoun brought up this sulbject
in the Senate, on the 1st inst. He offered
the following resolution which was agreed
to.
"Resolved, That the President of the U.
States be requested to communicate to the
Senate, whether the Government or G.
Britain has made compensation in the
cases of the brigs Enterprise, Encomium,
and Comet, the first of which was forced
by stress of weather into Port Hamilton,
Bermuda Island, and the other two wreck
ed on the keys of the Bahamas, and the
slaves on board,forcibly seized and detain
ed by the local authorities; and if no com
pensation has been made, the reasons why
it lins not been made, with a copy of the
correspondence bet ween the two Govern
ments which has taken place since the an
swer to a former call on the same subject
by the Senate."
The .Compromise Act.-The Washing
ton Correspondent of the Charleston Cou
ier, writing under date of the 31st uIt.
Iay.,
."Col.Binton has taken singular ground
on the subject of the Compromise Act.
*He considers it as a humbug-as imprac
ticable and absurd. lie says that, at the
very next session, Congress must begin to
remodel -he Tariff, with a view to supply
the Treasury."
Gale at the North.-A tremendous gale
was experienced at the North, on the 26th
uIt. Much damage was done in the city
of New York. Many houses were injured,
andi some vessels near N. York were di.
masted, and others blown off the coast.
Several thousand barrels of naval stores
were swept from the wrharves.
The storm was felt at Albany, where
there was a great flood, and much damage
done to the boats on the riv'er. The gale
came from the South East, and passed
over Newark,,N. Jersey, and many places
in New England. It was very severe at
Hartford,Connecticut,injuring many build
inge, and the shade and fruit trees.
Gen. Gratiot.-It will be remembered
that this Officer was recently removed, on
account of alleged defalcation. in a com
munication made by him to Congress, he
says that so far frotn being a defaulter, the
Government is indebted to him. It is said
to be the opinion of Mr. Horace Binney and
Mr Walter Jones, eminent lawyers, that
the claims of Gen. G. against the United
States,are founded in l'aw, and equity, and
should have been allowed. The case is
at least doubtful.
Stephen Van Renselaer, of New York,I
died on the 26th nlt.
Three hundred dollarafor a Story.-We
have seen advertisements by sotme of our
brother editors, offering 8300 for a Story.
A Bank editor will write one, for one guar
ter of the money.
The publication of the Washington
Chronicle is suspended.
Missouri.-The follow~ing is a good
hoax on the foolish debates, which oflen
spring up in Lcgislattive bodies. The St.]
Louis Gazette says, that the Legislature
at the latest date, was discussing the sub
ject of early rising. Thtirty eight mnembetrs
were present. The rest had not returned
from a frolie.t
Maryland.-Thbe Hon. W. D. Merrick,
was re-elected from Mdaryland to the U.I
States Senate, for six years, from the 4th
of March next.
The Legislature of Indiana, constituted
of an overwhelming majority of Whigs in 1
both branches, have passed resolutions con-t
demning the agitation of the subject of1
the abolition of slavery in the States andi
the District of Columnbia. There wvere I

hotnse.--hronicle Sr Sen. ',

FLORIDA WAa.-From an officer who
arived last evening, from the seat of war,
we learn that the Indians are scattered
through middle Florida, in very small par
ties, and that there is no prospect of bring
ing the war to a close for some time.
Cattle in great abundance are found in all
the hammocks, to which they resort for
food and the few Indians who have been
killed and taken, were plentifully supplied
with ammunition of the best quality,
Gen. Taylor, had gone to Tampa Bay,
having learned that a number of the Sem
inoles and Micasukies intended to surren
der themselves at that place.
It was reported that the express rider
from Fort Harley to Micanopy had been
killed near the latter place. Vcry little
confidence was placed in the rumor of a
surrender at Tampa Bay. Gen. Taylor
has established a cordon of Posts from Tal
lahassee to Suwannee river, between which
and the Gulf, most of the Indians are sup
posed to be. Twenty-five men of each
company are mounted, which renders a
speedy concentration of a considerable
force practicable upon an emergency. And
by gradually drawing the posts towards
the Gulf, thus narrowing the field of oper
ations, the General expects to force the In
dians to a speedy surrender.
The Rail-Road Bank Bill.-The Lex.
ingtou Observer, of the 26th ult., says that
the Rail Road Bank Bill was laid over,on
the 25th ult., after a speech of Mr. Merri
wether against it. This was done at the
instance of its friends. and the vote was
not expected to be taken until the 30th ult.
The same paper states that the citizens
if Frankfort. without distinction of party
on the 23d uIt., gave a public dinner "to
the distinguished commissioner from S.
Carolina, Col. C. G. Memminger;" that
a large number of citizens and members of
Legislature participated in the festival,
and Col. M., in reply to a complimentary
toast, made a speech of great eloquence
and power.
The Bill to establish the Southern Bank
of Kentucky, has passed the House by a
vote of 61 to 36.
DREADFUL EARTHQUAKE,
ST. PFRaRE, MART~rIQuE,Jan. 12.
You have undoubtedly heard of the
dreadful calamity which has befallen our
unfortunate country, already so much to
be pitied in every respect. The disasters
of yesterday are incalculable. There is
not a single house in St. Pierre, that must
not be re-built or entirely repaired. We
have lost but two persons who were crush
ed under the ruins, and about 20 were
wounded; but Fort Royal is completely
laid even with the ground, as we hear of
in the history of Herculaneum,Pompeii &
Messina. Not one fourth of the city has
yet been searched, and they have already
found,522 (lead bodies. The Hospital at
Fort Royal is likewise destroyed, and all
the sick therein perished.
According to other letters and reports, of
different persons arrived at Point Petre,
from Martinique.ou the 13th and 14th inst.
it would appear that all the wooden hou
ses had 'escaped the disaster. Nothing
yet can be said of the state of the flrtifica
tions at Fort Royal and of the other estabi
lishments of the Government, of which
no mention is made in the letters of our
correspondents. But from the reports col
lected from the adjacent countries, we
would infer that the Sugar Factories had
;uffered considerably; already, the known
losses are estimated at more than ten mil
lion of francs. 'On the 12th, a vessel ar
rived at St. Pierre from St. Lucy. hy
which we heard that that Island had felt
but slightly the shock of the Earthquake.
In the Virginia House of Delegates on
he 16th Mr. Stephenson presented the
rollowing resolution:
Resolved, That the Committee on Banks
be instructed to bring ina a bill providing
ror the incorporation of a state bank, with
i Capital of $20,000,000; and the Parent
Bank to be located in the city of Richi
xiond. with- branches at such places as the

Cotton.-During the early part of the
ast week business was very languid; hol
lers were unwilling to gush the article for
vard, and operators kept back for later ad
ices. Subsequently, however, accounts
rom Liverpool to the 24th December,
which represented an advance ofid on all
easeriptinn. have tended in a degree to re
establish confidence, although purchasers
remitin in 9 feverish state, and act very
cautiously. Up to the closing hour. an
advance of 4 cent was established, and
sales brisk at the current rates. Whether o
Upland Cotton has now reached its acme. n
or will still further advance, time alone can
determine. We quote extremes 12 5-8 and 0
