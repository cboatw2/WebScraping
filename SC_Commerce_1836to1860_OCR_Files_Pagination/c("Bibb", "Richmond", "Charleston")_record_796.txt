rialiata by kindly extending our time in common
with others,—thereby granting us further indul
gence in the payment of our regular instalments
as they become due for the principal, our church
aiul property, in accordance with the provisions of
the acts of assembly for obtaining the loan, would
have been forfeited, and accordingly sold, for satis
faction of the entire debt. The indulgence on our
bonds, here referred to, expiring with the ensuing
year it will be seen from the above statement,
that unless there be a united effort to meet the de
mands thereon as the instalments become due, the
penalty will be enforced, the aforesaid property dis
posed of, and the mortgages accordingly satisfied.
The plan for raising supplies which was submitted
to the consideration of the membership of the
church, and by them very generally approved of,
we are apprehensive, will disappoint our most san
guine expectations, the fervor of spirit which was
exhibited at its adoption, having, to .a great extent,
subsided; that which we had looked .to with so
much confidence, will be unavailing we fear. To
our friends in general, and the membership of the
church in particular, here and elsewhere, who have
kindly contributed and paid up in full for the above
object, we tender our grateful acknowledgments.
At the same time, we earnestly look to our subscri
bers who have not yet found it convenient to pay,
and beseech them to forward the amounts for which
they voluntarily pledged themselves. Their timely
attention to this, will confer a special obligation on
the Board of Trustees, who act officially in this
matter for the churches ; and take off a pressing
weight of anxiety from the minds of all concerned
in the prosperity of the Charleston church. Remit
tances may be made to any one of the stationed
ministers, who will kindly receive them for the
Board, or to the subscriber.

MONTGOMERY CIRCUIT, S. C. CONF.
Brother Wighlman,—I would again employ your
columns, to acknowledge the goodness of God to
his church in the bounds of this circuit, and fur
nish the returns from several of our meetings in
testimony of the same.
Our camp-meeting at Shiloh, the 17th of August,
was a time of much rain, which prevented many
from attending, and very much annoyed the congre
gation at the stand; yet the Lord gave a measure
of success to his word. Twelve persons professed
to obtain pardon of sin, and eighteen joined the
church before we closed. At Sardis, I held a two
days’ meeting, assisted by several local brethren,
on the 2d of September, which was protracted two
days in consequence of the rich displays of divine
mercy; and resulted in the conversion of twenty
three persons, all whites except six; and forty-three
were admitted on trial in the Methodist E. Church,
a large majority of whom were whites. The third
quarterly meeting for this circuit was a camp-meet
ing at Smyrna, on the 15th of September. Here
again the rain interfered with the size of the con
gregation until Sunday. And though the descent
of the good Spirit was not so copious as the rains
had been, yet we were favoured with refreshing
showers from above from time to time, and at the
closer we could number of professed converts twen
ty at least, and perhaps thirty if all could have been
counted; yet seventeen names were all we ob
tained there for trial in the church. A three days’
meeting was appointed at Zoar, which commenced
on the evening of the 21st of September, and was
blest of the Lord indeed ; for many of the friends
pitched their tents on the ground, and remained
there in camp-meeting order until the close. The
meeting was protracted one day, and resulted in the
happy conversion of twenty-two souls, if we may
rely on the reports of the persons who are the best
prepared to judge in the case, even those that feel
the ulove of Ood shed abroad in their hearts by the
Holy Ghost given unto them.” Thirty-one at Zoar
gave their names to the church for membership.—
Brother Parker held a two days’ meeting at Mt.
Pleasant, commencing on the 29th of September,
which was protracted from day to day until it cov
ered nine day in its progress. Thirty-three con
verts were counted, besides several in whose minds
there remained doubts, while they were not without
hope in God. Forty-three were received on trial.
At Bethesda, I had a two days’ meeting on the 7th
of October, where twelve joined the church; yet
only one or two were enabled to praise God for
pardoning grace. Our camp-meetiug at Zion,
commenced on the 13th inst., and closed this morn
ing. The fruits are not less than eighteen, and
perhaps reach twenty-five converts among the
whites alone. Forty-five joined the church, a ma
jority of them whites. Besides the above, we have
held several two days’ meetings. I find the ag
gregate of our additions up to date, is four hundred
and a respectable fraction over ; while the number
of converts amount to the rise of two hundred, in
cluding those before reported. Our local brethren
on this circuit have rendered efficient help at nearly
all of these meetings, and are content to await
their reward until “ the resurrection of the just.”
May the good Lord still pour out of his Holy Spirit
and revive his work yet more and more. Amen.

LENOIR CIRCUIT, S. C. CONF.
Dear Brother,—We have had Beasons of refresh
ment at most of the appointments on this circuit,
and, at some places, very remarkable manifestations
of the divine grace and blessing. At Page’s, I
commenced a meeting on the 18th August last,
which was protracted six days, at which much good
was done we humbly trust. Sinners were brought
under serious concern, and many of them, forty I
think, turned from darkness to light Believers
were abundantly quickened and comforted, and fifty
live were admitted on trial in the Methodist E.
Church. At our third quarterly meeting, held at
Central camp-ground, twenty were converted and
added to the church. More than one hundred and
fifty persons have been admitted on trial during the
year, and I think the prospect good for the acces
sion of many more. I send you some new sub
scribers whose names you will find on the other
page. Yours, affectionately,
October 6. H. E. Ogburn.
For tho Southern Christian Advocate.
TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN.
You are aware that for nearly two years I have
been endeavoring to procure the means of purchas
ing a Parsonage at Marion Village, for the accom
modation of the Presiding Elder’s family, of the
Wilmington District. I have succeeded so far in
obtaining subscriptions, as to be able, on the faith
thereof, to bargain for a house and lot, for the above
purpose; and now, as it is impossible for me to see
those persons who have subscribed, 1 hereby1 re- j
quest each of you, brethren and friends, who are
pledged in this matter, to pay the amount forthwith
to one of your travelling preachers, who will hand
it to me at his earliest opportunity, with the name
of each contributor; and will give a receipt,
if required.
Brother,—Friend,—whoever you are, who have
subscribed to this object, I beg you to respond
promptly to this call. Reflect for a moment;—on
the faith of the pledges given me I have bargained
for a Parsonage, but I cannot pay till the subscrip
tions are collected; and I therefore earnestly en
treat you to do your part at once in relieving me.
Each one doing this, the work will be performed at
once. I beg you, immediately on reading this no
tice, to lay by you sacredly the amount for which
you are pledged, and meet your preacher at his next
appointment, or sooner, and pay it over to him.
The preachers in the District are earnestly so
licited to aid as far as they can in this matter.
A full showing will be made as soon as the bus
iness is closed. H. A. C. Walker.

GENERAL INTELLIGENCE
FOREIGN.
Twelve Days Latek from England.—First in
importance is the cheering commercial intelligence,
which is summed up by the European Timet as
follows:
The revival of trade is the theme of general con
gratulation. Every branch of business feels its nour
ishing glow. In the manufacturing districts all is
bustle and activity. The demand, too, is principally
confined to the home market Orders for the East,
more particularly for China, have come pouring in
of late. But the other great foreign markets, the
United States and Brazil—are in a state of compara
tive, if not actual, stagnation. The Cotton market,
that unerring barometer of the commercial tempera
ture—continues active, sometimes buoyant The
sales for the week, ending the 30th ult, (Saturday,)
have not been quite so great as previously, but the
demand has been well sustained, and holders are
firm. Speculation has subsided a little, but the pre
sent feeling is at once healthy and encougraging.
The same remark applies to the markets for Col
onial produce. Sugar has improved,—the better
qualities. B. P. is ready, while Bengal and Mau
ritius have realized higher prices. The foreign
market for this indispensable necessary of life is
inactive. The grain market has experienced the
effects of the general revival. The increasing sup
plies of new grain keeps the market from rising, al
beit it exhibits an upward tendency. Flour has ad
vanced Is. per sack, and Canadian wheat and flour
are a good deal inquired for.
The accounts respecting the new cotton crop,
which came to hand by the Britannia, are deemed
favorable to holders. The sales on Saturday ex
ceeded 6,000 bags, of which 2,000 were taken on
speculation. But Monday last was one of the most
stirring days which has ever occurred in the mar
ket The sales amounted to 20,000 bags, of which
enormous quantity speculators took one-half. Yes
terday, being Tuesday, the great Manchester mar
ket day there was comparatively less doing; but the
sales, notwithstanding, reached 12,000 bags, of
which speculators took nearly the half. The mar
ket to-day (Wednesday) is still in a state of great
excitement, and remained so at the time we put our
paper to press. An advance of a farthing per pound
has taken place on most descriptions of cotton
since the arrival of the Britannia. The darkest
hour is generally the precursor of the dawn ; and
the intermittent fever through which we have pas
sed, seems to promise for the future a career of
healthy and invigorating action.
The Harvest.—Although the weather of the
past week has not been so uninterruptedly fine as
during the preceding fortnight, yet it has been suf
ficiently favourable to allow harvest operations to
go on without intermission, and in this part of the
country very little grain remains in the fields, al
most all having been gathered in excellent condition.
Greater progress must be made in thrashing before
anything like a correct judgment can be formed of
the yield. From all we can learn, however, the
opinion expressed by us last week is strengthened,
that the yield per acre will be decidedly below an
average throughout the country, but that, from the
extra breadth under wheat, there will be an average
aggregate.—Leeds Mercury.
Iron Steamers.—.Two iron steamers were
launched at Liverpool on Tuesday last at noon,—
one of 600 tons burden, called the Nimrod, for the
City of Cork Company, from the yard of Messrs.
Vernon & Co., on the North Shore ; and the other,
of 500 tons burden, from the yard of Messrs. Da
venport, Grindrod & Patrick, Queen’s Dock. The
last is built for a house at Calcutta, and is intended
to run between Calcutta and Singapore; she is
called the Iron Queen. Both launches were ex
tremely successful. Messrs. Vernon have received
orders to build two iron steamers of the same con
struction as the Nimrod for the East India Company,
and two accommodation boats of large burden, for
the navigation of the Ganges. Orders, too, are ex.
pected for vessels calculated for the Indus, but at
present none have been absolutely received.
Oriental Steam Navigation.—The Oriental
Steam Company have, it is understood, proposed to
the East India Company to undertake the convey
ance of the mails on the other side of the Isthmus
of Suez as well as on this side, offering to effect
improvements, by which not only considerable ex
pense would be saved, but a month would be gain
ed in the communications from the United King
dom to Bombay, and two months in the communi
cation to and from Calcutta.
Loss of the East India Mail_Just before the
sai ing of the Hibernia, news reached England by
express from Paris, of the total loss of the E. I. Mail
Steamer Memnon, off Cape Guardafui on the coast
of Africa, near the straits of the Red Sea. The
ship struck a reef—and the Captain is charged
with all the blame. The passengers and treasure
were saved, but the baggage, mails and ship were
all lost. There were 170 persons on board.
Ireland.—Waterford, Sept. 24.—This day
(Sunday,) there was a great meeting of the repeal
ers of Waterford and the adjoining counties, as
sembled at Lismore, to receive Mr. O’Connell.—
There were about 150,000 at the meeting. Mr.
O’Connell declared that, with the exception of the
Tara demonstration, which possessed many associa
tions of other days, the meeting he had iddressed
on that day transcended every other meeting he
had been at. (Loud cheers.) He said that they
had made an impression not only on France, Amer
ica, and Europe, but also on the English, who were
beginning to understand them, and who might, by
and by, attempt to bribe them. (Much laughter
and enthusiastic cheering.) They might talk of
compromise ; compromise to the wind ! he would
have no compromise. (Cheers.) He had planted
his standard and he would stand by it through weal
or woe, and on that standard was engraven “ Re
peal.” (Tremendous and prolonged cheering.)—
Ho had enjoyed much of the confidence of the
people. (A voice, ‘‘And justly.”) Perhaps no
man, undignified by the title of king or monarch,
ever enjoyed so much popularity. His heart was
centred in Ireland : he never compromised her._
(Great cheering.) Though he was offered place
and pension, and the highest office under the
Crown would have been given him, he laughed
them tosporn, and he would do it again. (Cheer
ing.) He had the people’s love and confidence,—
(hear,)—and he believed there was no love lost
between them. (Cheers.) He wanted them, there
fore, as they were ready, a little to> ready, to keep
quiet. The stage coach of the constitution was
going down the hill too rapidly, and he wanted to
put a drag upon the wheel. (Laughter, and “hear.”)
Let them believe no man that advised them to go
faster than he desired them; their keeping and
safety were is his heeds, and he would consent to
the shedding of no man’s blood, save his own ; but
they might depend upon his taking them safely
through the contest, provided they left the manage
ment to him. (Cheers.) He had his plans ma
turing, and Was prepared to deliver them by de
grees ; and before they again beheld hiln they
would find that he had advanced the cause.—
(Hear.) After alluding to an alleged project to
bribe the priests by the payment of .£690,000 per
annum, Mr. O’Connell, expatiated at great length
on the advantages to be derived from an Irish Par
liament ; summing up all with the assertion that
there was no blessing that would not cover the
land if they had the repeal. A banquet took place
at Lismore, in the evening, when the Rev. J. Shee
han and the Rev. N. Cantwell, delivered very war.
like speeches, breathing fierce hostility towards
England. The latter declared that he was a man
of peace, and would not take any offensive part,
but he would take a very active part in defence,
and he had left 7,000 men behind him who were
prepared to go with him to the mouth of the cannon.
(Great applause.)
Disturbances in South Wales.—Several oth
er outrages since the attack on the police and the
destruction of the. gate at Pontardulais, have been
committed. A letter from Carmarthen, d^ted 22nd
September, says,— #
“A bill has been issued offering a reward of
£500 for the apprehension and conviction of the
murderer of Sarah Williams, the Hendygate toll
collector, and her Majesty’s gracious pardon to’any
accomplice except the person who shot her. An
other bill has also issued, offering a reward of
£100 for the detection of the parties who destroyed
the Lleebryd Fishing Wear, on the 14th instant.
About fourteen different toll-gates and bars have
been pulled down during the week. It would be
useless to give a detailed list of them, and the maN
ter is only worth mentioning to show that the system
of lawless violence is scarcely, if at all, abated. I
regret also to state that another act of incendairisra
took place last night at the brick-yard of Mr. J. R.
L. Lloyd, of Dolhoidd, one of the magistrates for
this county. About 600/. worth of property was
destroyed.”
Other acts of incendiarism, of a minor character,
have deen perpetrated since this letter was written.
In the meantime it has been openly reported that it
is intended to place Carmarthenshire and Cardigan
shire under martial law,—an impression which, na
turally enough, has created considerable exaspera
tion. There does not seem, however, to be any
reasonable grounds for such an anticipation, although
it is a well known fact that the very best measures
have been adopted for the rapid conveyance of troops
from one point to another. The Swansea Journal
warmly contends that there is not the slightest
necessity or even pretext for any such extreme un
constitutional measure.
Spain.—Our private letters from Mataro of the
10th inst. announce that the pronunciamenlo against
the Government, and in favour of a central junta,
was progressing rapidly throughout Catalonia. The
garrison of Figueras, described as the strongest and
most formidable fortress in Spain, had declared in
favour of the junta. Another important garrison
and fortress, Hostalrich, had also sent in its adhe
sion to the junta of Girona. A rising attempted to
be made at Vich, in favour of the Government, had
totally failed. Prim had been compelled to retire
on Esprugas, three leagues from Barcelona. Lam
purdan had also pronounced for the Central Junta.
Barcelona continued to be strictly blockaded, but a
large force was collecting throughout the province
of Catalonia to march to the assistance of the insur
gents. The Captain General, who still continued
in the citadel, had been obliged to discharge 400 of
his men, who manifested an unwillingness to fight
against the inhabitants of Barcelona_Times.
Our accounts from Madrid are of the 11th inst.
The Espectador and the Eco del Comercio both
asserted that the Lopez Ministry positively intend
ed to demand the intervention of France. The
Government still kept the events of Barcelona con
cealed from the public. General Concha had been
sent off to Catalonia to supersede Prim in hie com
mand. The Gazelle contains a degree organizing
a consulting junta in the department of Foreign
Affairs, under the presidency of the Duke de Frias.

DOMESTIC.
[Reported for the Southern Christian Advocate.]
State of the Charleston Cotton Market.
October 24, 1843.
The last accounts from Liverpool per steamei
Hibernia are decidedly favourable. An advance ol
1-8 on cotton in Liverpool, has occasioned an ad
vance of 1-5 to 3-8 in our market, and sales were
yesterday made at these rates. The market abroad
is firm, and trade improving in all its branches.—
We quote prices at from 6 1-4 to 8 1-2 extremes.
Fair of the American Institute.—The an
nual fair of this Institution is now open in New
York city. Among other curiosities exhibited is
Store’s patent water time-piece. Mr. Store thus
describes his invention :—
“ It gives and keeps the hours, minutes, and se
conds with the greatest accuracy, the motive power
being water; which will render it evident to all
that a more perfect uniform power can be produced
with far less complication than by means of a spring
or weight, thereby rendering this kind of time-piece,
by its simplicity, less liable to get out of order, and
more certain of performing correct time, provided it
have a regulator or pendulum not subject to altera
tion by change of temperature, which is accomplish
ed in this clock by an original and simple contri
vance; it is further simplified by a new method of
giving motion to the hands or indexes, which is done
without the aid of wheels or pinions ; in addition to
these advantages.it requires no winding up, as it
can be kept in perpetual motion by attaching to it a
Croton water pipe, or by conducting water in various
other ways, as a fast drop is amply sufficient to keep
it going.”
A Hint to Wine Drinkers.—According to a
foreign journal, at the last sitting of the judges in
the Island of Jersey, in the course of a conversation
on the quality of wines manufactured in the island,
it would appear that chemistry has made such rapid
progress that wine is now made out of all kind of
vegetables, and even from shavings ! and a proof of
this is, that there are 200 barrels of wine manu
factured in Jersey, annually, without a particle of
grape juice!
The Boston Journal adds to the above—“ A large
portion of the wine drank in this country, Cham
pagne, Sherry, Madeira, or Claret, is manufactured
by the Yankees; and although it contains a goodly
portion of alcohol, it is destitute of grape juice. It
is a vile and poisonous liquor, and in itself offers a
strong inducement for total abstinence from all in
toxicating potations.”
Fires in tiie Woods of Canada.—The county
of Beauharnois, throughout its whole extent, has
been for many days the scene of most destructive
conflagrations ; which, owing to the long continued
drought of the present season, have swept off not
the underbrush only, but also the heavier timber,
leaving nothing but ashes in their track. Other
districts of the province have also suft'ered to a
great extent. In many instances the fire has tra
versed the upper soil of the cleared land, consum
ing the new stacked hay and grain, and the stand
ing oats, and destroying even the potato and turnip
crops. Some barns and dwelling houses, too, have
been consumed. In the swamp lands, which when
cleared and drained are the most productive that
the farmer can place under cultivation, the soil,
baked and hardened, is rendered useless for present
purposes, and it will require ages of vegetation to
restore its fertility.
Coal Trade in the Valley of the Mis
sissippi.—The Cincinnati Chronicle assigns appro
priate importance to the coal trade in the Valley of
the Mississippi, which although now only in its
earliest infancy, is destined to become an object of
vast concern. In the year 1832, there were recei
ved at New Orleans from the interior 24,120 bush
els of coal, while during the present year the receipt^
there fro* the same quarter amounted to 255^008
bushels—being a ten-fold increase in ten years.
The Chronicle remarks that the trade in western
coal at New Orleans, however, is only an evidence
of the increase, not of the quantity. The consump
tion of coal at Cincinnati is four times that of New
Orleans, and increase of the trade has been nearly
as great.
Marshal Bertrand.—Marshal Bertrand spent
the whole of Saturday, the7tli inst., with Hen ry Clay,
at Ashland, and left on tho following morning for
Cincinnati. The Lexington Observer of the 11th
inst., says:—“ Marshal Bertand arrived in this city
on Friday evening last in the cars from'Frankfort.
His arrival was announced by the discharge of artil
lery. The fact that the time of his arrival here
was not generally known until a short time before,
prevented the proper arrangements being made for
a formal reception. He was, however, met at the
rail road depot by a number of gentlemen, and con
ducted to his lodging’s at Brennan’s Hotel.
India Cotton.—The falling off, says the New
York Express, in the supply of India Cotton, impor
ted into England, will be very considerable.—In
1842, the quantity reached 355,000 bales; this year,
1843, it is estimated that the quantity will not be
over 200,000 bales. This is an item of considerable
importance in estimating the stock of cotton in
Europe, as the supply must be made up from the
growth of the United States. .
Visiters to Niagara falls.—It is said ten
thousand persons have paid toll at the Goat Island
Bridge, during the past season. This, at 25 cents
each, produces the handsome sum of two thousand
five hundred dollars.
The Oregon Question.—The Madisonian, allu
ding to this question, says, “ If we are not mistaken,
it will be settled one way or the other during this
Administration.”
Low Wages—In the country parts of Canada,
says the Montreal Herald, thousands are glad to
work for two dollars a month.
Silk Whiskers,—Among some contraband goods
recently seized, were twenty-two pairs silk whis
kers.

SOUTHERN QUARTERLY REVIEW.
In commencing the Fifth Volume of this publica
tion, the Editor wishes to urge, with earnestness,
its claims upon the patronage and support of the
Citizens of the South. Its circulation, always re
spectable, but never large, requires to be, ana, it is
believed, may be, much extended, and the work be
thus rendered a more efficient organ in maintaining
the rights and sustaining the literary reputation of
the Southern States. The discontinuance of other
periodicals, which have divided the public patron
age, renders the present time a peculiarly appropri
ate one for presenting such considerations as will
awaken a new interest in it, and for making such
efforts to extend its circulation as will place it on a
permanent basis.
It may be proper to state, briefly, the leading ob
jects which such a Periodical proposes to accom
plish, and also the reasons, which show the impor
tance and necessity of sustaining one with energy,
at the present time, at the South.
The general objects of such Periodicals are
pretty well understood. They serve to embody the
opinions of enlightened minds on all great questions
in which the interests of the arts, sciences, letters
and politics are involved, at certain periods in the
history of the country. Their aim is, not only to
review books, and, in the spirit of thorough and
impartial criticism, to decide upon their merits, but
also, in the performance of this duty, to discuss im
portant subjects in such a manner as to make deep
and permanent impressions upon the character of
the people and the destinies of the age; to diffuse
knowledge, not to foster prejudices; to create, di
rect and control, not to echo, opinions; and finally,
to canvass principles and maintain truth in a calm
and dignified manner, and in a style chaste, lumi
nous, nervous and appropriate. The offspring of a
high state of civilization, they furnish evidence of
intellectual advancement, and are the object of a
just and honourablepride, regarded as the exponents
of the literary standing and character of communi
ties.
The importance of sustaining such a work at the
South, with ability and effect, is equally obvious.
The South, like the North, and the other sections of
the Union, owes a duty to the age and to the coun
try in behalf of her literature. She requires an
able and high-toned Periodical, that is fitted to nour
ish, and call into active exercise, the literary talent
of our Southern Commonwealths. But, more than
this, our institutions are peculiar, and require a dis
tinct organ through which they may be defended
with power and spirit, when assailed, as they often
are, by other sections of the American Confederacy.
This aggressive conduct on the part of our Coun
trymen, so prejudicial to the general harmony, re
quires to be met and repelled by argument, first, and
by action, if necessary, afterwards. The South is
an agricultural country, and her position is different
from that of othersections more particularly devoted
to commerce and manufactures. Her views of her
peculiar interests should be known, and require to
be maintained and defended with ability, through
some such channel.
