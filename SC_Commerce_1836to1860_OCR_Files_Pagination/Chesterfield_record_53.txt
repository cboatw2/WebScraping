a lew days previously to notify me were
about to assemble at Jackson prepar- i
atory to their march to this frontier.
I deeply regret the *rou!)le and disappointment
to the brave and patriotic volun-'
teers, and more especially the embarrassment
to yourself individually, which mv requisition
has occasioned.
However much I may have erred in the
hope and opinion which I entertained and
expressed in my letters of the 29th of
April and lOthof May last, that this frontier
was no longer in danger of being
attacked or again menaced by a formidable
savage foe, I have the satisfaction
to find that no great evil or injury to the
service has as yet resulted from the error?
an error in*o which the wisest and best of
our statesmen appear to have fallen?and
from the same causes which hud operated
upon my mind and misled me, namely, the
apparent prosjxets of a speedy termination
of the irnr hrl.TSPii lhi* Mrrir.titi and Text
arts. I cannot however, admit that I have
erred in requesting of your Excellency
the Regiment of Mounted Gunmen in question.
1 have, during the I;jst and present month
been strongly impressed with the bcliefthat
the whole of this frontier would be involved
in an Indian war as soon as the threatened
hostilities between our blood-tlursty neighbors
ol the W est should be renewed.
When I learned from the Secretary of
War that the President of the United
States approved my views, reported to him
in March and April last, to assemble upon
this frontier an effective force of mounted
*inen, equal to that of the billigerents?a
force that would enable me to speak to
both in a language they could not fail to
hear and to hoed ; and when at the same
time I found myself expressly instructed bv
n letter from the Department of War, dated
May 4.1830?(of which a copy is annexed,
No, 1)?tlvit the President ici/l sanction
i- ? . ./ i . r ^
iw empoymenioj iniaierer jorcc may </i necessary
to protect the Western frontier of
the United States from hostile incursions;
and that the Department of War had addressed
the Governors of the States of
Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky
and Alabama, requesting them to call
into the s Trie such militia force as I may
find necessary in carrying into effect the instructions
heretofore given to me, adding.
44 the theatre of operations is so distant from
the seat of Government that much must be
trusted to vour discretion!" "The two
great objects you have to attain arc, first,
the protection of the frontiers, and, secondly,
as strict a performance of the neutral
duties of the United S.ates as the great objectof
self-dcfeuce will permit;" and when

the same date, of which the following is
an extract: ,k I am instructed by the President
to request your Excellency to call info
the service of the United States the number
of militia which have been or man be required
by Gen. Gaines," there can be no!
ground to doubt that 1 was fully authori/.ed
to request of you the regiment in question.
That from 4,000 to 10,000 Indian warriors
will be employed against the inhabi- ;
tants of the disputed territory, as soon as ;
the theatre of the war between Mexico and j
Texas is extended to the left bank of the j
Brasses, I have no doubt; unless, indeed J
ihe prospect of our having on this frontier
sufficient mounted force to repel the inva- ;
sion of the disputed terri ory, and afford to
the defenceless inhabitants that protec- j
tion which wo have promised to afford j
them.
Iam more than willing to risk myself!
will 1.600 men for ihe nrotection of a thin
* I
ly settled frontier of 400 miles in extent;
but with full authority from the Department :
of War io call for whatever force I may ,
deem necessary and proper for the pur
pose, I am not willing to have less force j
than I have called : for, without a force of :
7,000 men held ready for action upon this j
frontier, the Indians can in one month destroy
nine tenths of the inhabitants within
? I 1
the disputed territory, with a great part of
the adjacent settlements, including those \
upon the Red river from Alexandria to Fort
Towson, embracing a large portion of the i (
original inhabitants when ceded to the United
States, with the finest cotton growing
section of the United States, whose annual ;
crop has already amounted to millions of}
uouars. (
' If it be true* that the Indians have deter- ; i
mined to commence hostilities as soon as <
the Mexicans approach the settlements east j;
of the Brassos, (and that this is their set- ;
tied plan I have iio: a doubt,) then it must
tc evident that we cannot obtain from Ten- <
nessee. or from any of th.c central or Wes- j
ternJStates, sufficient force to prevent the j
apprehended depredations, as they may be
to a great extent perpetrated whilst the requisitions
for force are on the route to the
States authorized to furnish r. With this
impression, I cannot but consider oitr pro- j
mise o{protection to this frontier wholly uncii}ic*nntml
fimt tn fvritfi hoVPX 1
and expectations which we shall not have
the sure means of fulfiling. I cannot willingly
be instrumental in producing on this
border scenes such as have occurred in
East Florida?a frontier ravaged and deso- j
lated before troops for its protection have !
been marched or authorized to march from :
their homes.
*" In my letter to the Secretary of War of
the 7ih of June, acknowledging the receipt
of his letters of the 2oth of April and 4th of
May, I concluded as follows: "Although I
have upon the whole of this frontier about
1,600 regular troops, mostly infantry, yet it '
will be recol!ec;ed that this force has to :
guard an extent of 400 miles of frontier,
unsupported by any other than very spare
settlements. and that the chivalry of Mexico
may be expected soon to fly to the res- ;
cue of their President, and reinstate his red :
j
allies, and inspire them with a spirit of re- j
venge against their white neighbors recent- j
ly screened from their barbarism. Under j
these impressions, 1 have deemed it proper \
to reouest Governor Cannon to authorize j
the brigade of Tennessee Volunteers, en-'
O # %
rolled under his proclamation of *hc 2?'h ?>f.
April las', to calcula'c on the probability of
another call at this place, and that, should I
have occasion for volunteers, as I appre[
hend i shall, those enrolled shall have a
1 preference to all others." In answer to
i which I received, on the 3d instant, a
letter from the Secretary of War, dated the
j 11th of July, (of which I annex a cop}*, No.
, 2.) in which you will perceive no cxpresl
sion disapproving mv purpose to call for a
| brigade of Tennessee Volunteers. The
I Secretary, however, expressly authorizes
| me to call on the Executives of .Missouri
and Arkansesfor one thousand men each.
But this authority did not reach me until the
3d of this month, when I had reason to be:
lieve the regiment of Mounted Gunman,
requested of you, had been raised, and
would be here before I could have suspended
their movement, if indeed I had deem;
ed it proper so to do. This however, did
not appear to me proper; on the contrary
I deemed it necessary to request of the Goj
ernors of Mo ssouri and Arkansas the two
1- J -.i?: i __
mousuna men auuionzeu us uuufircnut
i(force, lor reasons set forth in my letter to
| Gen. Arbuckle, (of which I annex o copy
i Xo. 3.) Of these measures the W ar
1 Department has been regularly advised,
j Some of our fashionable party leaders,
j edi:ors and others, seem very much shock,
j ed at my preparatory measures to cross a
! little muddy branch of the Sabine Bay
. (which branch some are pleased to call the
| Sabine, whilst others of more liltemrv pre{
tensions call it the Rubicon.) to hold the
; savages in check, merely because some few
| white men have been kiiled i>y them, and |
j some women and children, the wives of the
j the slain, have been taken prisoners and
j carried off to the bosom of the wilder;
ness!
In reply to such silly effusions of the selfish
slaves of pary, 1 need only remark
j that in deciding upon the course of
| measures proper for me to pursue
in reference to the outrages commit*
: ted by the Indians near me, I think it
i my duty to consider the poorest frontier

; IUIIH; v uunuucj J111 uiv iijuiun uv?.Y ^
; knife as en ifled to the same attention, and
j the same vigilant measures of protection, as
(the most fashionable of our interior citizens.
If I wete capable of making an invidious
1 distinction in such a case, between the rich
! and the poor, the lordly ]>olitician, and the
- humble/w/irrr, and of taking more or less
care of the one than of the other, I should
j thereby prove myself to be wholly unworthy
! of the trust reposed in me.
But I am exultingly reminded by some,
j that the people killed, and those menaced
1 by the Indians, are not citizens of the Uni:
ted States. I reply that most of them arc
citizens of the United States; and that
whenever the national boundary line is established
in the manner provided by treaty,
"? ? ? i n 1.1 1
many, jt not all ol those who mid tnemseives
left upon the Mexican side of the line will
return to our own beloved country. But,
until then, we must protect them from savage
massacre.
Since 1 sat down to write tins letter an
express has arrived, with a positive declaration
that he had seen and conversed with
a Mexican officer at an Indian village, forty
miles to the northwest of Nacogdoches,
who was understood by the Indians to be i
engaged in setting 011 foot an expedition '
against Nacogdoches. This I believe to .
be true, because it is in accordance with <
the previous statements of several persons <

ARTIFICIAL EYES.
We can ourselves bear witness to the accuracy
of the statement in the following
communication. Doctor Walde.a lew days
ago, brought the gentleman referred to, to i
our office, and we were both surprised and 1
delighted to witness the perfection with which 1
the Doctor had supplied his patient with a J
new eye. The artificial eye was so precisely
like the natural one that no person, without ,
the closest examination, could discover any ,
difference. What is most astonishing is, 1
that the regular movement of the natural eye 1
is given to the artificial one, and the move- 1
ment of the one corresponds precisely with J
the other. -Little or no pain is experience.'! '
by the person having one put in or set. No !
person who has been so unfortunate as to |
lose an eye, ought to remain without an ar- ;
tificial one a single day. The triumph of 1
art, as exhibited in this case, is truly wonderful.

possessed the blessing of sight with but one 1
eye, the other, which he informed me, was

coloring, so brilliant in expression, and so c
trim in motion, that in mv oninion it would i
baffle the skill of almost any person to discover
the difference between the natural and

there is not even as much as a flat bottomed j pa
boat at this time plying on its waters farther
north than Cheraw, S. C. Happily, how- .
ever, this subject, of such infinite importance
is again we hope, about to receive some
attention:?the idea of instituting Shallow
Draught Steam Boat Navigation has recent- j
ly been brought forward, and as it is well |
known that many of our inland streams are be
navigated with steam vessels drawing but a af
few feet water, it would appear that such bi
boats could be used and effectually too, on of
this river runing through the entire breadth T
of our State. From a communication in
the Carolina Watchman, by G. W. Pearson, ^
who made a survey of the Yadkin from
about 12 miles above the Surry line, to the jja
Montgomery line, at Stokes' Ferry, a distance
of about 80 miles, it seems that in j
that distance there are 38 shoals, about one lov
third of which could be passed in common to
water with boats drawing 2i to 3 feet water,
and that in fact there are but 5 or 6 shoals pa
in the whole distance presenting any seri- Jo
ous obstructions, and admitting that the ra- an
pids at each shoal would average of a ^ mile so
there would still be fifty-five and a half
miles smooth water?that is from the flat
Swamp, to Bean's shoals in Surry. q

Shocking Rail Read Accident.?The PhilaIelphia
U. S. Gazette says:?The following
iccount of a most painful accident on the Coltmbia
Rail Road was left at our office by a
riend, who it will be seen was a witness of the
>ainful scene which he describes.
Fairview, Sunday, about 8 o'clock.
This afternoon, as the train for Lancaster
vas approaching Fairview, the axle of the forvard
car, or next to the baggage broke,
fhich immediately precipitated the car upon
he railway, the fragments of the axle ripping
tp the bottom cr the car, in which was a Mr.
jibson of Philadelphia, bound to Cincinnati
vith his wife and children. His wife and
ffiild fell through and nearly the whole train
jassed over her body. I cannot picture to
.i t i V *
rou tne nean-ren .ing tcene that ensued, wnen
Mr. Gibson was called to the spot where his
vife lay a mangled corpse, with the ciiild,
ibout 18 months old, by her side covered with
he blood of its dead mother. The top of her
lead was cut cff, and the brains on both side
he rail; the body, feet, arms and legs broken
o atoms. Heavens! what a sight! the disracted
man tenderly dragging from the spot
he remains of his ' Julia' called upon her in
rantic exclamations; but she could only an;wer
by expiring look of agony. He next pick;d
up his babe, and believing it too was dead,
an around the crowd imploring assistance,
vhen it was impossible to afford him the least
:onsolation. The ciiild was miraculously preerved.
1 was next called to witness another
tcene which beggars description. ?
A black man, who had vainly attempted to leap
rom the car when the accident took place fell
ipon the ground and the car running off the side
le jumped, the wheels passed over both his legs
md cut them off in the most shocking manner
p-inding the dirt and clothing into the manrlo/1
T-Io lov writhincr in the most ex
j'tu liv t? - - - ^ ?? ??? ? :ruciating
agony, under the body of one of the
:ars, until enough of assistance could be renlered
to raise the car off him. He will not
t is believed survive.
A gentleman in the forward car had liis left
irm broken, and breast much injured, but it is
>ossible he will recover.
The train was propelled at the rate of 15 to
18 miles per hour at the time of the accident,
ind ran not more than the length of the train,
>r 50 yards ere it brought up.
I was with my family in thS next car to the
>ne in which Mr. Gibson was in, and the firagnents
over which we passed, tore up the botom
without injury to its passengers. It was
i mirarle that we escaoed?one of our wheels
vas spokeless, nothing but the naked rim wa9
eft to give assurance it ever was a rail road
vheel. Even the rail, of a considerable die*
ance, were tom from their fastenings, and
;ome broken."
This seems to be one of those accidents
igainst which it is difficult to guard, unless by
ome new arrangement of the wheels and axles
if the cars, or perhaps by a thicker flooring of
he cars.
It is mentioned to us that the engine and
ine car was immediately dispatched to Lanaster
city tor medical or surgical aid for the
ufferers, and that before it returned the cars
vere set in motion.
In the hope of conveying the wounded towards
medical aid they had gone to a short
urn, when the locomotive came sweeping
ound, and was not checked until it came in
ontact with the cars and did considerable inuy.
EDISTO BRIDGE DESTROYED BY FIRE.
We learn that the Bridge across the Edisto
liver, over which the Rail road wa3 constructd,
was totally destroyed by fire on Tuesday
ight last. It appears that it must have been
be act of incendiaries, as fire was comratmiatcd
to both ends and to the middle of tho
(ridge at the same time.
We have been informed that measures were t
nmediately adopted, by the use of tiats to J
eep up the communication, so that no inter- J
jption will take place, in the transportation of I
assengers. J
