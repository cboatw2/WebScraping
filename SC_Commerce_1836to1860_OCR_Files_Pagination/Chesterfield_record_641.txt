SOME REMARKS ON T1IE
MANUFACTURE OF MAIZE SUGAR.
By William Webb, of Wilmington Del.
(Published bv the National Society.)
The most profitable application of labor
is a desideratum too frequently overlooked
orjdisregarded bv those who attempt (he introduction
of new manufactures into a
country. All calculations of advantage
which is to result from the production of
any article, must be made with due re
gard to this point, or practice will prove
them to be erroneous.
Fully impressed uith this truth, the
most' rigid examination is invited into
every thing now offered, so that, as far as J
possible, wc may arrive at a correct do- !
cision respecting the reel value of the
proposed manufacture. j
In common with many others, I have
felt considerable interest in the plan for
. extending the cultivation of sugar in tern- |
perate climates, and have made manv 1
experiments; first, upon the Beet, and recently
upon Maize, or Indian corn, in the
hope.ofdiscovering some mode bv which
" the desired end might he attained. The
results from the latter plant have hcen
extremely encouraging. The manufacture
of sugar from it. compared with that
from Beet.offers many advantages. It is
more simple, and less liable to failure.
The machinery is less expensive, and the
amount of fuel required is loss by one
?
"f - half. The quantity of sugar proaimcu
/on a given space of ground is greater, be*idc*
being of better quality.
An examination info the nature and
productive powers of these two plants
will show that no other results could have
been reasonable expected. It is n well
established fact, that every variety of
production found in plants is derived from
|he sap. It is ascertained that the prin
cipal substance found in the sap or juice
L of many vegetables, is sugar. Therefore
v V * Ihe amount of saeharine matter produced
by any plajj^of this description, may
an analysis of the fruit,
of such plant, wiicn ripe,
grain yielded bv corn, and the
peed from beet in the second summer of
PPP* its growth, arc nothing more than this
$ap or juice, elaborated by the process of
vegetation, and presented to our view in
another form,
Now, as it is contrary to the economy
of nature to suppose that there should hp
^ . any loss of nutritive matter in this change
of sap into seed or grain, does it not iol
)ow that there must by the same difference

in the quantity 01 sugar proaucou i??- ?n?:
two plants as there is between the nutritive
properties of beet seed and corn .'
The juice o." Maize contains sugar, acid,
and a gummy mucilaginous matter which
forms the scum. From the experiments
of Gay, Lussac, Thenard, KirchotF, and
others, it appears that starch, sugar, and
gum, are extremely similar in composition,
and may be as readily converted
into each other, by chemical processes,
as they are by the operaiions of nature.
Forexample: starch boiled in diluted sulphuric
acid, for thirty-six hours, is converted
into sugar of greater weight than
the starch made use of. This result goes
to show that every pound of starch found
in the seed of a plant, has required for its
production at least one pound of sugar in
the form of sap. If it be objected that
this deduction is too theoretical to he admitted,
it may be answered that experiment.
so far as it has gone, has fully at tcs
ted its correctness.
The raw juice of Maize, when cultivated
for sugar, marks 10 degrees on the
Kaccharometcr. while the average of cane
juice (as I informed) is not higher than
7 degrees, and best juice not over 3 degrees.
From 91 2 qts.(dry measure) of
the former, I have obtained 4 pounds 6
ounces of syrup, concentrated to the
^ point suitable for crvstalization. The
proportion of cristalizable sugar appears
to be larger than is obtained from cane
juice in Louisiana; this is accounted for
by the fact, that our climate ripens corn
* while it but rarely if ever hap
f r f -- I
pens that cane is Hilly matured. In some
cases (lie syrup has crystalizcd so completely,
that less than i-Gth part of molasses
remained. This, however, only happened
after it had stood from one to two
months. There is reason to believe that
if the plant wore full ripe, and the process
of manufacture perfectly performed, that
the syrup mijht be entirely crystalized
without forming aov molasses. This
perfection in the manufacture cannof
Kntvcvpr he attained w ith the ordinary a|f
|iyi?V'vi ?
paraias. Without any other means
"r-i .... - i'-;- \ 7'^t
pressing out the juice than a small hand-1
mill, it is impossible tosav how great a
quantity of sugar may be pioduced on an '
acre. The experiments have been dircc-I
ted more to ascertain the saccharine qua!- [
ity ofthecorn stalk, tnan the amount a !
given quantity of ground will produce; but j
the calculations made from trials on a j
small scale leave no room to doubt that
the quantity of sugar will be from 800 to
1,000 pounds.
This amount will not appear unreason,
able, when it is considered that thejuice
I nf mm i?< ns rich as that of cane, and the
weight of green produce, at least equal.
Mr. Kllsworth, in one of his publications,
states as the result of actual weighing
and measuring, that corn sown broadcast
yielded five pounds of green stalks per
square foot; this is at the rate of 1081-2
tons to the acre.
My attention was first directed to
Maize as a material for sugar, by observing
that in some stalks the juice wns extremely
sweet, while in others it was
weak and watery. On examination it np- j
|>eared, that the latter had home large
and perfect ears of grain, while on the
former, these were either small in size, j
or entirely wanting. The natural con- j
elusion from this observation was, that if J
the ears were taken off in their embryo,
state, the whole quantity of saccharine
matter produced by the process of vegetation,
would be preserved in the stalk,
from which it might be extracted when
the plant was matured. Hut the idea oc- j
curred too late in the season to test it by I
experiment. A few stalks however were I
found, which from some cause, had borne I
no grain; these were bruised with a rnnl-f
let, and the juice extracted by a loverYc
1 press. Some lime was then added, an Joy

and finished in a single vessel. I>y thvt/ a

exhibition of our Society in 1840. /
1 have since been informed, throua 0
Mr. Ellsworth, that Mr. Pallas of Fran J> ^
had discovered in 1839, that the saccl/- j;
rine properties of Maize were increa/d j
by merely taking off the car in itseml*'o
state. An experiment, however, wrch
I instituted to determine the value oyi??s v
plan, resulted in disnppointment;/the ?
quantity of sugar produced was not ArS? l'
enough to render it an object. Th/rea- e
sons of this failure will be sufficient ?b* o

On mi whole, there appears ample
encouilpunrnt for perseverance; every
step injne investigation has increased the
probaaiticsof success?no evidence having
bin discovered why it should not i
succcfi as well, if not belter, on a large
scalcichnn it has done on n small one. In
tlie 1st place, it has been satisfactorily

nW.'be made from the stalk of Maize.
V* j"'CG of this plant when
lj iVated in a certain manner, contains
I?ycharine matter remarkably free from
i/eign substances. 3rd, The quality of
'/ s juice, (even supposing we had no
/per evidence about it) is sufficientv
/ monstrated by the great amount of nil/
? n
, itive grain which it produces in the naural
course of vegetation.
It is needless to expadiatc on the vast
dvantages which would result from the
ntroduction of mis manufacture into this
ountry.
Grain is produced in the West, in such
verflowing abundance, that the markets
ecome glutted, and inducements are offered
to employ the surplus produce in;
istallation. This business is now heoming
disreputable. The happy coniction
is spreading rapidly, that the use
f alcohol as a beverage, instead of conucing
to health and strength, is thesur.
st means of destroying both. Some
thcr production, therefore, will he reuired,
in which the powers of our soil
iay he profitably employed. This, it is
oped, will be found in the business now
ropscd. Instead of distilleries, convering
food into poison, we may have Rugar
ouscs, manufacturing at our doors an
rticle in universal demand, not merely
scful, but necessary; furnishing as it does
ne of the most simple, natural, nutritious
nrioties of human sustenance, found in *
he whole range of vegetable production.
t is said that the general use of sugar in
iurope, has had the effect to extinguish
he scurvy, and many other diseases for*
*
lerlv epidemical.
The time of the crop in the sugar is.
md, (says Edwards,) is a season ofgladless
and festivity to man and beast. The
ncagre and sickly among the negroes exnbit
a surprising alteration in a few
reeks after the mill is set in action. Rut !
hough the use of sugar is attended with
ri O
II these agreeable effect?, there is no aricultural
production furnished at so
;reat a sacrifice of human life. The rea.
ons of this mortality may he found in
he climate, and the peculiar situations in
rhich cane is cultivated. How much
hen will betaken off the load of human
uffering, if this article can be produced
n more temperate and healthful regions!
The wide prairies, and fertile alluvial
alleys of the West offer an ample field,
ich with all the elements of success.
A glance at the history of the sugar;
nanufacture will render it evident that,
vhether our project is destined to succeed i
?r not, something of the kind must, of necessity,
ere long he introduced.
The cane was first planted in the Ts.
and of Barbadoes about the year 1642.!
)n comparing the accounts given l>y Li- |
jon, who lived at that time, with the '
iverage of others taken one hundred and
ifty years afterwards, it appears that the j
cultivation of a given quantity of land in
anes required, at the latter period, more
han three times the number of slaves
bund necessary at the former. The anount
of crop, at the same time, was much j
liminished. It is believed that this pro- j
jrcssiveincrea.sc in labor, and decrease!
n produce, has occured in every situaion
where the cultivation of sugar is
carried on under the same system. This
icing the case, it requires no gift of proihecy
to discover that the constantly increasing
demand for this article cannot
continue long to he- supplied from the
same sources.
An expectation is cntertainod by many,
.hat a greater amount of exports will be fur- !
liehed trom the West Indies inconsequence
>f emancipation ; but they will probably be
lisappointed. 'J'lic system of forcing humap j
abor beyond the point of endurance, though .
jnfortunately roinmcn in many parts of the I
a'orld, has no where been carried 10 greater j
extent than in these Islands. It was com- !
Tienced by the Spaniards, shortly after their
itscovory, and continued with unrelenting
severity, until tbe native population, which
ivaa origitully large, had dwindled to nothing.
;Cw- ^ . v*' - ' . , v '*. /
- V, -
It has been continued since upon the nngro :
race, and the same'result has only been prevented
by successive importations from Africa.
But as the slave frade is now generally condemned
by civilized nations, a supply of labor
era from that source cannot be expected. The
effect of emancipation in the VVest Indies,
will be, to render manual labor more moderate,
and the exports less. For, although the
produce of the Islands may be increased by a
more judicious application of labor and capital,
it may be expected that the domestic
consumption will be extended, by the increased
ability of the free laborers to purchase the
staples for their own use.
The amount of exertion which can be sustained
under a tropical sun, without injury to
health, is very small.
Un this stinjecr Lhckson remarKs?" i nai
in no part of the-Creator's works is his beneficent
economy more admirable, than in proViding
the inhabitants of hot regions with j
fund, clothing, and shelter, at a comparatively
trifling expense of labor. Had the same severe
and incessant toil been necessarv for
subsistence in hot, as in temperate climates,
the torrid zone could never have been inhabited."
It may be doubted whether a tropical country
can ever furnish a great amount of exports,
except through the means of compu'sory labor.
It appears then, highly probable, that
if the inhabitants of temperate countries wish
to continue the use of sugar, they must find
some means to produce it for themselves. The
Beet appears to succeed well in Europe, and
the manufacture from it is extending rapidly ;
but there is no hazard in making the assertion
that Indian corn is far better adapted to our
purpose.
The following mode of cultivating the plant,
and makilig the sugar, is the best that can
now be ofi.-red.
The kind of soil best adapted to corn is so
well understood, that no directions on this
point are necessary, except that it should he
rich, the richer the better; if not naturally
fertile, manme must be appiicd either ploughed
in or spread upon the surface, or used both
ways, accordn'g to the ability of the owner.
* r _ 1 ... f.- ?t.A
ix owing can iorm a oeiwr preparation iur mc
crop, than a clover sod well turned under,
and harrowed Hue immediately belore planting.
Select for seed the largest and beat ears
of any variety of corn not disposed to thiow
up suckers, or spread out in branches ; that
kind most productive in the neighborhood, will
be generally the one best adapted tothepurpoae.
The planting should be done with a
drilling machine. One man with a pair of
horses, and an instrument of this kind, will
plant and cover, in the most perfect manner,
from terr to twelve acres in a day. The rows
(if practicable, let them run north and south)
two and a half feet apart, and the seed
dropped sufficiently thick in the raw to insure
a plant every two or three inches.
A large harrow made with teeth arranged
so as not to injure the corn, may bo used to
advantage soon after it is up. The after culture
is performed with a cultivator, and here
will be perceived one of the great advantages
of drilling,- the plants all growing in lines,
perfectly regular and straight with each other,
the horse-hoe stirs the earth and cu's up the
weeds close by every one, so that no handhoing
will be required in any pirt of the cultivation.

remarks on tiik agricultural statistics.
( Continued.)
Cotton.?This, it is well known, is
the great staple product of several States,
. C7
a3 well as the great article of our experts,
tho price of which, in the foreign market,
has been more relied on than anv thing
J O
else to influence favorably the exchanges
of this country with Cireat Britain and
Europe generally. The cotton crop . of
the United States is more than one-half
of the crop of the whole world. In 1834,
the amount was but about 450,(100,000
of pounds; the annual average now may
be estimated at 100,000,000 of pounds
more ; the value of it for export at about
$02,000,000. The rise and progress of
this crop, since the invention of Whitney'scotton
gin, has been unexampled in
the history of agricultural products. In
the year 1783, eight bales of cotton were
seized on board of an American brig, at
the Liverpool custom house, because it
was not believed that so much cotton
could have been sent at one time from
the United States ! The cotton crop of
1841, compared with that of 1839 and
1840, was probably less, by from bUU.UUU
to 600.000 bales. In the early part of
the last cotton-growing season, an average
crop was confidently anticipated;
but this hopeful prospect was not realized.
In portions of the cotton-producing
States, as in parts of Georgia, however,
the crop was greater than usual; and in
Arkansas it has been estimated at a gain,
over that of 1839, of 33 1-3 per ccr.t.;
but probably, owing to its having suffered
from the boll worm, it should beset down
at 20 or 23 per cent. A similar advance
is expected in future years, among other
causes, from tho great incrpase of population
by emigration. Mississippi, Georgia,
Lousiana, and Alabama, Jjouth Carolina,
and North Carolina, are, in their
order, the great cotton-growing States.
An important fact deserves notice here,
on account of the relation which the
cotton crop bears to other crops. When
ever (\o whatever cause it may be owing)
the nrice of cotton is low, the attention of
r
cultivators, the next year, is more pnrtic
ularly diverted from cotton to the culture
of corn, and olhpr branches of ag'iculture,
in the cotton-producing States. As cotton
is now so low, and so little in demand in
the foreign innrkct, unless a market be
created at home it most necessarily
become an object of less attention to the
planters; and it cannot be expected that
the agricultural products of the West will
* f m . f -
find so ready a sale in llie Southern market
as in some former years. Other '
countries, too, as India, Egypt, and other
parts of Africa, Brazil, and Texas, are
now coming more decidedly into Competition
with the cotton.growisg interest of
our country; so that an increase of this
product from those countries, and n corresponding
depression in ours, are to be
expected. The amount of India cotton
imported into England in 1840 wa9 76,703,295
pounds; almost equal to the
whole cotton cron of North Curolina and
_ r - South
Carolina, or to that of Alabama,
for the past year, and nearly double the
amount produced by Tennessee, Arkansas,
and Florida, combined; being, also,
an increase on the importation of cotton
from [ndia, the preceding year, of 30,
000,000 of pounds, and, in amount, nearly
one-sixth of tho whole quantity impcrted
during the same year from the United
States. From the report of the Chamber
of Commerce of Bombay, it appears that,
from the 1st of June, 1840, to the 1st of
June, 1.841, the imports of cotton into
Bombay amounted to 174,212,755 lbs.;
ana the whole India crop is estimated, on
good authority, at 190,000,000 of pounds
This is a larger quantity than America
produced up to 1826, and more than was
consumed by England in the same year,
and nearly one-third of the whole estimated
crop of the United States in 1841.?
From these facts, it is evident that it is
becoming more and more the settled policy
of England to encourage the production
of cotton in Inc|ia, while it is equally
certain that a foreign market cannot be
relied on for our cotton, to the same extent
as it has hitherto been. An English authority,
9peakingof the decline of Eng.
land and of her manufactures, a$ haying
commenced a downward progress, in
accounting for this decline, attributes the
distress in Leeds, and other places, to the
landholders, who, by excluding the foreign
bread stufls, have driven foreigners to
manufacture in Self-defence, This decline,
not being confined merely to her old
staple of woollens, innst, too, operate in
the reduction and diminution of cotton
exported from this country. The following
statement confirms the position now
taken: ,
" In 1824, Great Britain exported to all
foreign countries, including the British
possessions, of cloths, <fec., 567,317
pieces; in 1828, 566,596 pieces; in
1830, 440,360 pieces; and in 1840, only
250,962 pieces. During the same year
last named, (1840,) the total manufactured
in only one district in Belgium and
Prussia, all within a days journey of each
other, was 333.245 pieces; so that, in
one district only, there was made more
than was exported hy Britain to all the
world, by 76 233 pieces."
Rice.?This product is cultivated to
comparatively a very little extent in the
United Sates, except in South Carolina
and Georgia. In the former of these, it
is an object of no small attention, and
ranks second only to cotton. It forms a
considerable article of export from this
country to Europe. England, hawever,
imports annually large quantities of rice
from India. The crop of rice in 1841 is
said to have been, on the whole, a very
good one, equal, if not superior, to the
usual average.
Silk Cocoons.?Notwithstanding the
disappointment of many who, since the
year 1839, engaged in the culture of the
morus multicaulis and other varieties of
the mulberry, and the raising of silkworms,
there has been, on the whole, o
steady increase in the attention devoted
to this branch of industry. This may be,
in part, attributed to the ease of cultivation,
both as to time and labor required,
and in no small degree, also, to the fact
that, in twelve of the States, a special
bounty is paid for the production of co
coons, or of the raw silk. Several of
these promise much hereafter in this
product, if a reliance can be placed on
the estimates given in the various journals
to nearly 755,200.000 bushels, or 42 1-3
bushels to each inhabitant. The number
of persons employed in agriculture, according
to the ccisus of 1840, was 3,717,756.
This, it is presumed, refers to
the rpalo free white adult population.

is believed, to call forth increased enterprise
among the agriculturists of our

Corn* oil is produced from corn meal
by fermentation, with the aid of barley
malt. It has been produced and used for
some time past in certain distilleries, by
skimming off the oil as it rises on the
meal in fermentation in the mash tub.?
It has, however, lately become the subject
of particular attention, as an article of
manufacture, and with success. The
meal, after it has been used for the production
of this oil, it is said, will make
belter and harder pork, when fed out to
swine, than before. The oil is of a good
quality, of a yellowish color, and burns

stalk as they begin to form, the saccharine
matter, which usually goes to the - ./?m
production of the ear, is retained in. the -^Jgj
stalk; so that the quaotitv it yields i*.J? ^
