Mr DEAS Sia-According to promise, vs
I take this opportunity of the return of the It
Hayne. to send you a few lines from this
dehightftl city. I hsave not any news to
tell you, except that the English-speaking P(
people here'are too few, to render my tn
public labors profitable. As to the slave bc
question, I see nothing materially different H
rm what I have already seen elsewhere, ti
except that I am informed there are here W
a considerable number of whilesUes, con- flt
sistiag of persons who having emigrated. tl
mnd being unable to pay for their passage. I
are sold by the captains of the vessels. It a'
is said the traffic is extensively carried on b
-that the emigrants, chiefly females. are c
entrapped by the ship captains. and delu- m
ded as to the parice of transportation, ant. n
finally sold ror the passage money. This c
practice seems, however, to be confined to i
Spanish emigrants ; and the slavery is 0
limited to such period as will pay the debt. ta

The Beaks.-Failure of the Commer- la
eial Bank.-The city was, yesterday. p4
thrown into real confusion by the an- in
noencement. in the morning, that the til
Cemmercial Bank had stopped payment. ec
This fact was the more astounding as no
run had been mad. upon it of late, and in
some little confidence was beginning di
again to be felt'in our monetary instinu. w
tions. The eauses which led to this re- (i
suIt, must have ernwn out of the previous it
management, whereby she was so much a
weakened as to be unable to stand up it
against the natural demands and exactions, pi
of commerce. She actually fel' from ex- If
baustion. ,I
As was to have been expected from so e(
Un1msward an event, the note holders. and
in some instances the depositors, took the v,
alarm and made a run upon the other al
banks. The Mechanics and Traders, and
the City Bank had to meet the brunt of
Ahe panic. They both paid out specie 6t
with great alacrity; neither made any at- rt
tempt to evade the run upon her-every y
officer being engaged in counting out the *a
dollars to those who wanted then. Ii
Towards 3 o'clock, the run upon the ft
City Bank greatly abated; but the Me- it
vbanics and Traders kept her doors open is
for two hours aller the usual time to ac
commodate such as desired to exchange i:
her notes for specie. it
Upon the State, Union and Canal Banks ti
the run was very trivial. si
In the height of the panic, Commercial a
Bank notes were sold as low as 40 per
cent. discount; but towards the close of
the day they rallied and were readily ex
changed at25 a 26 per cent discount.
It is not to be expected that the commu
nity will feel easy under such shocks up- ,
on confidence; but yet we believe that
there are a number of banks in the city
which are perfectly able to live throgh f
the worst of panics.
. We have not ascertained the amount of
specie lost by the various banks, nor do
we think it necessary to go into the par
saiars of yesterday's flare up. We d

Aweful Catastrophe f-About 4 o'clock y
this afternoon, another land-slide occur- fa
red from the hill (Ms. ida,) where the t
awful catastrophe of Janury 1. 1837,
transpired, exceeding in extent and conic- h
gunee, that memorable disaster.
Some eight or ten dwellings, occupied.
by poor fanmilies, were crushed and buri
ed beneath the mass of earth. in these,
it is sopposmed, there were not less than '
Thirty or Forty Personts, only ten or
twelve of whom escaped.
Within an hour, nine bodies were dog
from the ruins--five of which were ni ith-I
ow life, one partieally injured, and three
not beyond recovery.
Had this avalanche neeurred in the
night, the destruction of life would have Is
been still greater. as many occupansts of C
the houses were absent at their labor or P
elsewhere. to
A man from the country. pansing as the I
time with his team, leaped from his sleigh o:
and escaped. The hurses and load of I
wood were buried beneath the earth, al
We just the scene of disaster. it is one h:
of horrific desolation. Thousands were r
congregated on the spot, and a corps of p
efficient men engaged in pentetrating the elC
earth and clearing away the fragmntns of' 2
buildings. ______
Ateful Calamily.-Two men, Messrs. p
Fletcher and Urover, residents of Quincy, ml
were killed last evening, (the 20th inst.); a
in a shocking manner. is appears that i
they were engaged in digging a- well for ti
Mr. John Parker. Last Thursday they i a
came to a rock that required blasuing, and h
in order to do this, the rock being cnvered IC
some 4 or 5 feet in the water, they placed Ial
a tim. canister filled with powder upon it. b<
Exertions were then made to expkade the
eanister, but all failed. On Monday. they B
concluded to. raise thme powder. which was n
coveal with gravel and water-anti had
succeded ins removitng a part of it, when
about sunset, one of the unfortunate men, .3
(both were in the well) struck a stone' al
with his iron lhar. int prying up she canis- s
ier, and it immuediately exploded. Mr. al
Parker, who was Ionkitng itnto the well as 3M
the time, is supposed to have lost both a'
eyes, ad another gentleman is somewhat M
injured. The two men who were killed te
were soon taken from ste well-and a ol
dreadful sight they exhibited. Mr. Gro-.e
ver's head was lIterally torn to pieces, and e i
Mr. Fletcher's hontes were broken in many G
places. They were so disfigured and Ias
blackened thait it was hard to recognise m
thorn. Thesy have both left families to hu
snonrn their lhs. Truly. --int the midst uof m~

Mfart as a Maxure -We have been fa
'red with the following copies of letters,
dressed by Mr. Ruffin, our State Agra
iltural Surveyor, to a planter, on Ashley

STEWAaT'S loT.T., Feb. 21.
DrAft St:-While waiting for an ap
inted call, I take the opportunity to
ake you an explanation which may not
i altogether superfluous. When Gov.
ainmoud referred to me the question of
a benefit of marling your rice field, I
aived answering as to the degree of bene
because of the wants of any facts on
at subject, but stated that, on the suppo
ion that one bushel shoul I be thereby
ided to the crop per acre, such increase
ting annual and permanent, would amply
Impeosate for applying a heavy cost of
ar. Gov. Hammond, thinks that, by
aking this snpposed case, I might have
nveyed to you the impression that as
nal an increase was to Ie expected.
u the country. I would expect 10 or 20
nes one bushel of increase from marling;
ad all I meant was. to siate a strong, and
)t true case, of a sufficient profit for the
bor, even though but one bushel were
armnuently added to the annual crop,
stead of 10 or 15, as I would think more
cely-and an improvement in quality
inal to that of quantity.
A thought has struck me in regarI to
arling rice land. The bed of marl is
iubtless under all your marsh. and a pit
ould reacis it ihere. at the greatest depth,
ny near the river side.) and get through
if that were determined on, much easier
d cheaper than on the high land: and all
ie marl drawn up in this scientfic ex
ritnent, would be so cheaply applied to
e surrounding rice around, that perhaps
at convenience would pay for the extra
mat of the deep digging. The marsh wuil,
presume. would furnish no spring, or
tin or water, to interrupt the diggiug,
ad I am sure the marl will not.
I have received your specimens got by
iy augur, and cm pleased it has bcn of
much use to you. I have tested them
ughly and annex the results.* When
)n are fairly at work and digging for use,
ind me specimens of all you desire to
) analyzed. %and certainly at every 10
et successive depths,) and I will analyze
em for you. A lump of average quality
desired for the State collection.
Should you choose to sink the pit, (bor
ig by a proper augur. which can be ob
iined here nearly complete,) and get to
ie bottom of the marl, or as deep as pos
ble, without reaching. its bottom, consider
e a contribsutor to the expense.

bottom out of-our market. We have no
sales to notice this week, and therefore
prices are merely nominal. We, how
ever, quote 4 a 6 cents as extremes; prin

of full J cent from last week's prices.

AvousTA, March 2.
Remarks.-We have not much too add
to our remarks of last Tuesday, on the
subject of cotton. The markets, from
which we have hearA, have left the unfa
vorable accounts recently received from
Europe. The price of the article bad
receded. and operitions had almost entire
ly ceased. holders not being willing to
concede the decline asked for by buyers.
Only forced sales were effected. In this
condition of the markets, which is nearly
the condition of the markets, which is
nearly lte condition of ours, every one
will look now for funrther accounts from
Europe. which may be expected in a few
days. We must confess that there is some
doubt in the plan pursued by some holders
of keeping back their cotton for better ac
counts and prices; yet we must acknowl
edge, that this plan would be the one we
would ourselves pursue, especially if we
could keep back sales for a few months.
We are confident that the panic which
has occurred in the European markets
will subside, anti that a better feeling will
arise, which will establish prices on the
truo proportion of supply and demand.
When they will be informed in Europe,
that, large as our crop will certainly be, it
will not go beyond, or at least a very tri
fling anount, the estimate taude a few
months azgo, and of which thoy were ap
prised in Europe, better calculations will
bu made, and more confidence will be cre
ased in the prices that a better knowledge
of the amount of production and of the
amount needed for actual consumption will
establish. This panic in the European
markets should noL alarm us, but. on the
other hand, should we learn by the next
arrival from Europe, that a reaction has
occurred, it will be the province of pro!'
deuce to keep cool, and not run away, and
too fast, with the favorable news we might
receive. And it is our opinion that a few
circumstances might produce a re-taction.
A few orders on the manufacturing dis
tricts-for goods or twist, either for China
and South America, or for the north of
Europe, might contribute to an improve
ment in the price of the raw material. The
infurmation that the crop of this country
will not extend to 2,500.000 bales might
exercise also some iunuence. And the
prospect of Parliament adopting some mo
dification of the corn laws, and some other
measures calculated to relieve the people
from their present distress, would no doubt
have much effect in creating greater ac
tivity in the manufacturtng districts.
These are suppositions which may be re
alized. The neat accounts will rlieva ps
aiota 4anees~saey-whierblesu to re
gards the future -condition of the cotton
markets in Europe.
Cotuts.-The recent news has paralized
operations in our market, which has re
ceded nearly three quarters of a cent. A
few. sales have been made, at a decline,
but generally planters do not appear wil
ling to sell now; the cotton in the ware
houses has been ordered to be kept out of
the market, and whten It arrives it is stored.
The receipts have been light for a few
weeks past by the rail road and by wagons;
some cotton is to come in by boats, but
the quantity is not large. We omit quo
tations, as no rates can be established'in
the present condition of the market. We
hope it will be in our power to give a bet
ter review of our market next Thursday.

the market opened with a full attendance
of purchasers, it having been understood
that holders were ready to meet them with
a corresponding decline to the. Liverpool
market. The sales on that day amounted
to 3252 bales, at a reduction from 4 to I
cents. On Tuesday, however, the de
mand being well kept up, holders became
rather unwalling to continue at those rates,
and the market partially recovered and
settled to an average decline of' about 4
cent, at which the operations since, have
generally been effected.. The sales on
Tuesday amounted to 2610 bales,on Wed
