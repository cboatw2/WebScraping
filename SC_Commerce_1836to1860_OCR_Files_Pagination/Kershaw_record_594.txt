The Preamble sets forth, that' "in the
iforesaid Act, Congress have undertaken, after
troviding for certain claims and expenses, to di- ,
ide the proceeds of the sales of the public lands
miong the twenty-six Slates of the Union, and

as the said Legislatures may direct." that
there is no warrant for this proceeding in the
Constitution of the United States, and from the
islory of the Government, it could not have
een one of the purposes for which it was formd;"
that "if the Federal Govarnment has the i

nact's "that no person shall be ap]>ointed to re- J

This bill came up for consideration in the (
enate, on Saturday, and able speeches were
lade in favor of it "by Judge 1Iuc.ee, Mt.Rhett,
ol. McWillie, and Mr. Quash. No;bhe said
word in opposition to it, but Mr. Vekdiep.; nor
o we think any one will hereafter. The debate
will be seen, is to be resumed today, and will
o doubt again attract a very crowded auditory,
'hat the bill will pass in the Senate, is beyond 1
doubt, and we should think by almost a unani- i
ious vote; and its passage in the House, also,
ould appear equally certain. The public l'eelig
on the subject is excellent: the idea of aceptingthe
foul bribe, is indignantly scouted as
deep stain upon the honor of the Slate; and
ur friends abroad, who are looking with great
tLxiery to the resuit, may confidently expect to
ee South Carolina do her duty, and spurn llic

iave had the insolence to otter her.

THE RIGHT OR SEARCH.
The seizure, search, and detention of Amerian
vessels by British cruisers on the coast of .
U'rica, which lias led to so many gross outrages
if our flag, and serious injuries to American citiens,
is at last officially laid before the British
government, through our Minister to St. James's,
dr. Stcverson, to her Majesty's Secretary of
foreign Affairs, Lord Palmerston.
Scarcely was there an arrival from Africa
without bringing intelligence of an outrage upon
American citizens and their property, while sailng
under the flag of their country, although the
aws of nations was violated upon every occaion,
and the aggressor made liable to be fired ino
without hesitation, by the first Araericau'niand-war
that hove in sight. These violations of
nternalional faith were of so Jrequent occurence,
and attended with such palpable wanlonicss
and injustice, that not only were the presses
if this country vehement in calling for redress,
,ut English journals also feeling that they could
tot justify or palliate the aggressions, spoke of
hem in terms of unqualified reprobation. The
inly .wonder is, that our government- remained
io long apathetic to an assumption of the right
>f cnnr:'li nnrl uniniro hv tllfi ,1 fronts of another
;6vernruont, and. that so many exemplification*

Committed. Better late tlian never,' however,
andlwe hope that the matter will nour.be prosecuted
until redre86 is obtained, and an assurance
that no such molestations shall hereafter take -j
place. - v '&"* " "
The case that has been laid before the British
government is that of the brig Douglass, of Mas- f t'
sacbusctts, which was boarded uy i.icuienam^D
Segram, from her Majesty's brigantine cruizcr,' ?
tlie Termagant, on the 21st of October, 1839, ,
while pursuing her voyage from Havana 1o the :
river of Brass, laden with merchandise and passengers.
The Douglass was boarded, searched, I-,
and seized as a Glavcr; her hatches were torn ' d
open, flag hauled down, and books and papers ! jj
removed to the cruizer; she remained in posses- i
sion of British officers until the 2oth of October,
when she wps dismissed .and permitted to pro-,. *
cced on her voyage. Documentary proof of these .ii
facts is submintted to her Majesty's Secretary
; of Foreign At Fairs, and upon them Mr. Stevenson
has asked for satisfactory retribution.
The above is but one of a number of unprovoked
and similarly flagrant proceedings, of 11
which evidence has in some cases been, and in v
j others might be, submitted to the State Depart- T
inent. The attack upon the Tigris, Sea Mew,1
Jones, and several others of even more recent j
occurrence, each might be made the subject of *
a demand for remuneration from the British j t
government. *.j s
The answer ol J,ora raunersion 10 rue appji-1.
! cation ol' the American Minister would seem to i
indicate that.hcr Majesty's cruizers are not of- j v
ficially delegated witiFthe indiscriminate authori-j1
ty which they assume, to board American mer-1 a
chan'men. Lieutenant Scgram had already been I'
called upcn to-explain how he considered him-'
self -justified in detaining aehip under American j q
colors, and with papers"; showing her to be t
American property, ahd-iier Majesty's government.
has now directed a prompt and searcing inj
quiry to be made into the facts of the case laid v
! before them. ti
I The cruisers in question, are said to be sta- j,
I tioned upon the coast of Africa for the forcible
suppression of the slave trade, and by virtue of c
diplomatic arrangements between the Govern- 11
ments they are allowed to board and search any t
vessels carrying the Spanish or Portuguese flag, B
when they way suspeci them of being engaged
in the slave traffic. No such power has ever
yet been delegated to them from this country, b
and therefore it is as idle to urge such suspicion c
as an apology for tlieir acts towards American
vessels, as it is to assume a right to search,
unless itbe first especially granted by treaty or
otherwise. " The evils and abuses to which s
such a power necessarily leads, may be, in a v
measure, judged of from a statement contained p
. in ;i eiiltcrwmon4" lo'tpp of T.nv.-1 P.almerstoii to Mr.
[ Stevenson?"during the period which ha.* elapsed
since that treaty (with Spain in 1835) has c
i been in oncration, her Majesty's cruisers have d
j taken and cent in for adjudication 85 Spanish a
slavers without, slaves" on board." And since
the same period "her Majesty's cruisers on the c
coast of Africa have detained and sent in for ad- o
judication 14 Brazilian vessels, without slaves \ d
on board, and only two with slaves on botird."? ,,
Thus,vessel after vessel may he taken possession
of on the most childish suspicion, sent into Sierra -s
I.eono for adjudication, and after being detained t<
there just iong enough to defect the commercial ! o
objects of the owners or freighters, and rob them 1
of the crnfiljywlli :.t j1 I' rtj lmr;::. -vonamui?f- .If,
tTio voyage, !>s released and pemrfrr^rt-t,; 1); uned j
either home or upon her journey. By this sort of y
proceeding the legitimate commerce to the coast; <<,
of Africa must be entirely broken up. ^
The American people are hostile to the slave
trade?they arc the lirst nation that interdicted it, e
but at the same time they will never submit toi
such aggressions upon the part of British criiisers, j
as have been committed under a pretext of sub- j
duing that abominable traffic. Their previous |p
remonstrances lo the British government have . ^
been almost unheeded, and we hope that the aj>- !
plication now made will le backed by others for jtc
remuneration for more recent injuries, and that loi
the matter will not be allowed to sleep until a [
proper and satisfactory settlement is had. | ^
' Our Relations with Est. land.?Notwithstanding
the acquittal and liberation of McLeod, Ul
we apprehend there will not he wanting an apolo- ar
gy for a war with England. The-assumptions of $e
the British ministry, in regard to the intercourse
between Great Britain and other nations, are too
arrogant to be overlooked. If other nations are Loo
weak to declare war against her, she can al-1
ways contrive a way to irritate them. If she can-1
not kick our Government into a war to -defend a I
portion of our territory against the aggressions of i
her colonists, she may possibly be more success
ful through the instrumentality of her naval com- ur
manders. We have already published a corres- aj.
pondence between Mr. Stevenson and Lord Pal- .
in erg ton, concern ingtfhe right of search, which,
Great Britain claims to exercise over our merchant
ships, under pretence of enforcing the law ac
nf nations against the slave trade. It is said that tM
Mr. Stevenson has brought home with him some
important document^- relating to this subject. 1-1

Air. Websterset out for Washington. The Itich- P1]
mond Enquirer says: "The most important corrcspondence
which Air. Stevenson had in Eng- c?
land, took place .we understand, but a few days Uj
before his departure. Pretty hot shot was tired er
on bot h sides, but the correspondence was con- or
ducted in good temper. Our minister gave the RU
last blow." m:
How hot the shot was, and with what effect !T1<
the last blow was given, we are not yet informed.'.
Probably the despatches alluded to will not be
made public until the opening of Congress?per- ^
Saps not then without a special call from that th!
body. Whatever may have been the tone of Mr.
Stevenson's letters, it is not probable- that they
will have much influence in arresting the prog- J^1
ress of British ambition and injustice, as exemplitied
by her ministers,' or the impudence and ras- , Ul
cality of the commanders of her ships of war.?!
Nothing but cannon ball ever brought her to ac- . '

intention,of securing oir merchantmen against ce
the annoyances of British armed ships, it must I.

13 Our friends have observed that the gentle- ?Vi

olves upon the publisher.
In assuming" the responsibility of conducting ?;
lie paper immediately after one whose qualifies- a
ions arc so much superior, and who has given !
itch general satisfaction, we cannot but sensi- ja
