"DOTH NOT EVEN NATURE ITSELF TEACII?"
A clergyman in one of the towns in the
State of New-York, at the time when the
protests against the use of liquors became
somewhat earnest, from the pulpit,?on
one Sabbath, delivered to his congregation
a thorough discourse on the subject. On
their way home, some of his hearers inquired
of eachothcr, what does allthismean?'
One gentleman who professed some
shrewdness ofguessing, (for a New-Yorker
?- imntnrpc ' <rnpc?.' as well as
ft1 uiiuuiu^a v/tiiuiv>J ? ..?
Yankees,) said,' I will tell you, gentlemen,
what is the difficulty ; we have none of
us sent Mr. any thing to replenish
his decanter lately. And my advice is
that we attend to the matter.' Accordingly
on Monday, a full sized demijohn of'old
spirits,' 'Cognac,' we are uncertain which,
was sent to Rev. Mr. , accompanied
with a very polite note, requesting
acceptance of it, from a few friends, as a
testimony of their regard.
Our worthy clergyman felt himself at
first in somewhat of a dilemma. But wit,
invention, and a good conscience, are
sometimes found in close companionship;
and they met in the present instance, to
help our good minister to ' back out' of the
difficulty. He took the demijohn to the
watering trough of his stable, and poured
some of the liquor in, and brought his horse
to it. Poncy expanded his nostrils, and
snorted, and blowed at it, as tho' he thought
it rather too hot, and seemed to say,
"What's this?" Next he drove his cow to
the trough, to sec if she liked it any better
The cow snuffed at it, and shook her horns,
arid went her way, with no fondness for
such a 'villainous potation.' Mr. :?
then carried his demijohn to the pigstye,
and called his pig out of his bod room to
taste. Fig grunted and snutteu. dipped nis
nose in and coughed, and went back again
to finish his nap in his straw.
Mr. then returned to his study,
and penned, in substance, the following
note to the present-makers with which he
returned the demijohn and its contents.
4 Gentlemen : With due acknowledgements
for your present, received this morning,
permit me to say, that I have offered
some of it to my horse, my cow, and my
swine; and neither of them will drink it.
That -which neither horses, cattle, nor
hogs will drink, I cannot think to be either
useful or safe for man to drink. I beg you
to excuse me, therefore, for returning the
demijohn and its contents; arid believe me,
gentlemen, your most obedient, &c.'

A Royal Crying Spell.?A London
correspondent of a paper in this city states
that when her majesty, the Queen of Great
Britain, was informed that the Tories had
cut down her husband's allowance from
fifty to thirty thousand pounds a year, she
cried like a child. The "crown" in tears!
What an interesting situation! "poor
thing!" She too must learn as well as the
more lowly maids that the course of love
never dii run smooth. But if she intends
to cry every time her wishes are crossed
by political partisans, she may expect to
weep her life away. However, she is not
all tears, but shows some grit. She took a
real womanly revenge upon the graceless
Tories, and would not let them have a single
sip at. her wine, or taste a morsel of
her wedding cake?and so there.

Messrs. Editors: Through the medium
of your valuable paper, permit me to make
u few remarks to this community, upon the
subject of LOTTERIES. I believe they
exert a most deleterious influence upon
Christianity in the church. And as an individual
professing Christianity, I feel it
my duty to lift my warning voice, feeble
as-it ntay be, against them. I wish to establish
that, the selling of lottery tickets i6 i
the worst sort of gambling. And in order i
to prove litis position, it will be necessary I
to show 1st, what we mean by the term i
gamble. If it means any thing, it means I
money slaked by two parties, liable to be t
Won by the one and lost by the other? i
now what is the essential difference be-j
tween this and the plan upon which lottc {
ries are generally conducted??None!!
?In the lrwinton Masonic Hall Lottery,
I, buy a ticket with three dollars, 1
may win or loose, otherwise it would be
no lottery? but not choosing to stake my|
money in this way, I go to a professed
gambler and wager three dollars with hirn,
upon a throw of dice, here as in the other|
case. I may win or lose. And who does,
not see that the principle in both cases is!
the same? Both are games of chance. And I
if one be pronounced gambling and the
other is excluded the same odium of epithet,
then language has lost its meaning.
Having proven that tho selling of lottery
tieKeis is gamDiing, wo are 10 snow in tne
2d place, that it is an unfair way of gambling.
I understand that it will; take about
twelve thousand dollars to construct
the Masonic Hall. Their proposed object
in getting up the .lottery is to accomplish
this purpose. They offer for sale filly
thousand dollars worth of tickets of course
I shall draw all the prizes, amounting to
thirty-eight thousand dollars, and it is not
possible for me t? draw one dollar more,
though I bought tickets to the amount of
fifty thousand. Now is it fair for any man
to bet with another when he has his cards
so marked,that ho must necessarily win!
But the holders of this lottery, are not betling
with one man, but with the community.
True ! but the same umount that I
as an individual would in buying up the
community must loose. And every man
that buys a lottery ticket/stakes three dollars
against two dollars and twenty five
cents. No one in betting would think it
fair for his competitor to require him to
stake one third mote than himself wagers,
but this lottery compny requires and compels
every man that buys tickets to do this.
Now I have made good, not only my first
position, but also the second. The selling
of lottery tickets, then is not only gambling,
but a very unequal and unfair way of
gambling.?Then we have established our
main proposition, that the selling of lottery
tickets is the worst sort of gambling
But the law allows and charters lotteries,
Yes ! And the law allows and charters
grog shops. And remember we arc now
contending upon moral principles, and
_t .i._. .1 <: r .1._ u...
ruiuuiiiutrr uitfi 1111; smiuuvu ui wiu tun iuw
can never make a thing right which in the
nature of things is essentially wrong. But
again the buildjng of a Masonic Hall, is a
good object. I do not mean to deny it, but
it is a principle long since laid down in
moral ethicks that44 we ore not to do evil
that good may come." Now in the third
place, I ask this community if they will
countenance this lottery gaming. Will
you give your cash a certainly for an uncertainty.
For my own part I had rather
employ what little I can get these hard
times to the payment of my honest debts,
and for the support of my family. Especially
ye professors of Christianity, as you
value your characters here, and to your
title to the heaven of the christians love
buy no lottery ticket?you are as solcmly
commanded to 44 avoid the very appearance
of evil" as you arc to repent and believe.
What! Christians engaged in buying
and selling lottery tickets ? At the
thought, Christianity blushes Oh, how
Christianity weeps over her tarnished honor
and blighted reputation !
LIE STILL.
Prospect of War.?The Maine question,
it will be seen, by reference to our
Washington correspondence, is assuming
a very threatening and bcligerent aspect.
Mr. Fox, the Hritish Minister, has adopted
a very undiplomatic and offensive tone,
in his correspondence with our State department,
and we arc menaced with ,4conseauences."
if we don't behave ourselves.
This, coupled with the concentration of
30,000 regular troops in the Canadas, ostensibly
to keep the rebels in order, looks
very like a design, 011 the part of Great
Britain, to get up an Arostook war, as a
prelude to a general one. Our voice is
not for War?our thoughts, we must confess,
are turned on peace?but we are
prompt Vd say that the spirit of our people,
whether of the cnterprizing North, the
hardy West, or the sunny chivalrous
South, will not brook threats with words
or weapons, and if the necessity is to be
forced on us, of again resorting to our
lines and our cotton bag's, against au invading
foe, wc must even humbly, yet
fearlessly, appeal to the God of Battles to
prosper/the right in the terrible issue of
actns. A spirited" Message from our President,'tinder
such circumstances, will
meet with a ready response from our gallant
and indignant people. We deem it
proper to say, in conclusion, that a war
ought not to arise out of this question,
that negotiation ought to adjust it and that
speedily?and that if" the conflict docs
come, .the rest of the civilized world
ought to set the seal of its reprobation,
and visit its indignation on the party in
fault. We }ket hope for the best, and that
the good sense of both parties will keep
them from hostilities, on account of a ter
ritory, certainly not worth the vast expenditure
of treasure, and flow of more
costly blood, that must, in such an event,
impoverish the coffers and lacerate the
hearts of both beligejents. i

Great Britain and the United States.? I
We are satisfied that our Washington i
Correspondent was not litcraUij correct i
in saying that ' a message of a warlike <
tone and aspect" had been transmitted to f
the Scnatei "by the President, in relation <
lo the Maine controversy. It is evident t
hat from his letter, published this morn- 1
ing, that llic Message, referred to in Iris 'I
previous 'letter, was the merely official (
and formal one, coveriug the correspon- a
dence between Mr. Fox and Mr. Forsyth, t
which we publish to-day. That corrcs- a
pondencc, however, on both sides, be- J |
trays irritation, and bodes the gathering ;i
of the war-cloud; but the more so on the j f
part of the British diplomatist, who seems ' s
... I.? L..1 ? t : .I. _ 1 -nr,_n_ I .
iu iic uub iiiicyiiig bin; urut'i9t auu ic|'?w-| i
senting the feelings of his Government.?1
In Mr. Fox's original letter, military opc-|
rations are distinctly threatened, unless'
Maine shall retire with her posse, within1
certain limits?and certain " consequences,"
are contemplated, the responsibility
of which, it is alledged, " will rest with
the People and the Government of the
United States." Mr. Forsyth's reply is!
very decided and uncompromising, as perhaps
it should be, in relation to the right
of Maine, -to maintain her present attitude ;
of keeping off tresspassers from the disputed
territory, with a civil posse armed,
or unarmpd;" according to the exigency,
and also as to the determination of the (J.
8. Government to uphold the pretensions of
Maine to the boundary line claimed by;
her, until she shall voluntarily assent to a
departure from it, or negotiation shall adjust
it otherwise. The rejoinder of Mr. j
Fox, is perhaps th<^ worst symptom of the,
rase?it is stiff, formal, and entirely des-,
litute of conciliation, and amounts to a
reference of the matter to his government
for ijistructions adapted to the emergency,
with an intimation that hostile preparations,
and perhaps operations, too, will,
in the mean time, be continued by the
British authorities in the disputed territory.
Thus troubled is the horizon with
portents of war; but we do not regard the
door as closed on cither side against further
negotiation. Mr. Fox communicates
the gratifying information that the British
government will soon base, on the report
ol its commissioners to survey the dis- \
puted territory, an answer to the last and t
still pending proposal of the U. S. Gov- |
ernment, on the subject of the Boundary i
npn-ntifltinn: and Mr. Forsvth reiterates i
the disposition of our government to refer j
the controversy to the arbitrament of a j
friendly power. Wc trust therefore, that (
nothing will be done on cither side, on I
the eve of the conclusion of a pending ne- i
gotiation, which may prove satisfactory, t
to embroil two countries in war, which r
are united by the ties of common lineage, c
common language and literature, and com- (
mon sympathies and interests, which arc t
in brotherhood in the advocacy of free I
principles, and on whom war can confer s
no benefits, and will certainly inflict and i
entail dire and lasting injuries.?Ib. 31 si. i

A TARIFF tO PROTECT TRADE. . "J
There is, to a class of men in this coun- S
try, a conviction altogether unaccounta- p
blev.that a certain remedy for all our com- e
plaints, social, political, and commercial, I
is to be found in the exaction of large sums I
of money from the people by the Federal t
Government. There is to them a mystic e
virtue in the phrases, "high duties," "la- t
rift'," "protection," and the like, that t
hath nothing equal to it in the whole phar- g
macopia of political quackery. Wc have g
noticed the general movement among the p
manufacturers in favor of a tariff to pro- I
tcct our "industry"?there is another pro- i
posed, of which a sketch was given in the
foreign correspondence of the National
Intelligencer, which we copied two days (
ago, for the protection of our commerce, s
It is tlic revival o: tne scnemc proposed? i
by llr. Madison we believe?immediately t
after the formation of the Federal Govern- ci
mcnt, for the infliction upon trade of a i
system of retaliatory duties. Thus; if 1
one nation imposes enormous taxes upon s
our products carried into their ports, that i
wo should revenge it by exacting an equal- t
ly enormous tax from our own citizens I
who may ear, drink, or wear, the pro- e
ducts of that nation, and so on of other /
grades of duties. If they change the tax- I
cs, we change: thus following, faithful as t
a shadow, for the Christianlike purpose n
of revenge, all the absurdities and caprices f
of all nations under the sun. It is evident
that this system could not coexist t
with a tariff to protect the manufacturers, <
yet so much are they enslaved to the ma- p
gic power of high duties, and such confidence
have they that if they can fix upon c
the Federal Government the system of un- ?
equal and harrassing exactions on trade, n
they can afterwards turn it to their'own a
purposes, that it would be by no means*"
surprising to see the whole larifT party'
running in to do battle for this new scheme; r

commentaries upon the protective system, t
After having given the world such prepos- C
tcrous lessons of unequal and unjust Ic- ll
gislation, we might belter hold our tongues,
and bear the retort in mcekftess. n
It appears that the duties levied by the b
German Commercial League upon the ll
products of this country average about 40 tl
per cent, and this we are to consider very tl
oppressive and unfair. What must have U
been the opinion of the world about us, tl
when we were imposing burdens equal to d
150 per cent? The Germans arc " protect- b
ing domestic industry! It is stated as a s<
case of peculiar enormity, that a heavy b
iluiy is levied on our'tobacco?a good article?in
order to promote the culture of a n:
miserable weed which they call by that vj
name, in Germany. Ilerc is exactly the If
;ase of the New Jersey lace makers over C
ignin?tlicy, poor injured men! cannot o;
:arry oil the manufacture of coarse and pi
vorililess lace, because the yery hckt and c<
incst quality of thcarticlc is brought from . fu
Belgium (oi\e of tlie members of tlris sailtc', c
Jcrman Commercial League) ami sold for" j
i less price under their own noses?so a
liey demand protection. This has been, j
md must ever be, the. principle of every I
>rotective system. But this scheme of <
claliation, if it were carried out iu good ]
aith and not made?as there is every rca- <
;on to apprehend it would be?an entering I i
vedgc for a new manufacturers, tariff, |
,vould be a system of fluctuations equally 11
uinous in the-end both to trade and in-'t
lustry. What sort of legislation should i
ive have if Congress were obliged to read '
lud act upon the revenue nets of every;]
nation of Kurope annually?. Neither nicr:hant
nor manufacturer could rnakeanv'
safe calculations under such a system.
Besides, we venture to say that our tr, j
has been more tenderly treated by foreign |
nations (no matter for what reason) than |
that of afty other people who have a con-; i
Siueraoia snare ri me vuimucitu ut cue < i
world. Ojj.r great article of export, cot- j
ton, has paid but a nominal duty, even ,
ivhilo we aVe burdened its retwrtis with ]
unheard o'f exactions. Let England and r\
France retaliate upon us there, and we
might be>.convinced too late that we had i
Jrawn a weapon with double edge. i
All these conflicting schemes of partial '
legislation, the projector of each fighting i
for hi3 own petty interest, and struggling ;
to get "the Government on his side, only j i
the rnoce conclusively show the necessity : i
if imposing duties on all imports alike.? ! I
Such a system, while it would be simple
n operation and just to all, would have , j
he incalculable advantage of permanence.
Having once established it, it would un? i
lergo the most trilling fluctuations in a-ji
lapting itself to all occasions, but those I
vhich stop commerce itself. i
From tho Pendleton Mosscngor. i
Some twelve or fifteen years ago there I
was a pressure in money matters similar I
o the present. Cotton for a few years
previous had commanded a good price,
legrocs and lands rose, and as usual tin- i
ler such circumstances, every body was
inxious to buy. Debts were contracted for

LAATEST FROM MEXICO.?SPIRIT OF THE
MEXICAN JOURNALS.
The treaty of indemnity for claims of
itizens of tlie United States against Mexico,
had been ratified.
General Santa Ana, it is said, had obtained
his passports, with the view of tra.
rolling, whether in the United States or'
n Europe was not known.
The pension granted by a former Congress
to the widow and family of the late
Emperor Itcp.bide, had been discussed
by the Congress, and confirmed.
The Mexican Congress had authorized
the Government to borrow $1,000,000, at
not less than eighty cents lor a dollar.?
This loan is to be one of the ways and
means for carrying on the expedition
igainst Texas. The principal resource of
the Government for this projected invasion
is the capitation lax, of which we have
heretofore spoktn. The Gazette of Tammlipas
alludes to this invasion of Texas
in terms of confidence:
'The campaign of Texas will achieve
much glory for Mexico, and restore her
name and her honor. The slavery of the
black man, which is tolerated in Texas,
and which was the cause of the revolution,
will arm tlie Mexicans to drive those
usurpers beyond the Sabine. Mexico gives
freedom to men of all colors, and she has
her destiny to fulfil in this respect.
