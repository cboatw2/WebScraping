.Norvell, in -a speech delivered in the U. S.
Senate, says,
"Two years ago, the little State of
Ahode Island, one year since the State of
Connecticut, three short months past the
empire State of New York fell into the
hands of political friends of Senators over
the way. And what was the immediste
result? Sir, in Rhode Island and Con
necticut, the Republican incumbents wee
swept by hundreds from office for political
reasons alone. Was there any difficulty
in finding pure and patriotic Whigs to sup
ply their places? No, sir! The only dif
ficulty produced by the emergency was, in
making selections among the crowds of
hungry vultures anxious to fat ten upon the
public crib. The atrocious injustice, the
cruel tyranny of removals from office, the
suffering wives and children, the starving
families of the dismissed officers, were libr
gotten as things of by-gone days. Mlem
ory was bathed in the waters of Lethe,
and no longer remembered what had been
said and sung prior to the halcyon.days of
Federal triumph. In New York, whose
able Republican son had been stigmatised
as the proclaimer of the "spoils" doctrine,
towards whom no- epithet of Federal re
probation was too strong for daily utter
ance,the first days of the Whig saturnalia,
have been celebrated by the proscription
of some of the best public officers ever
confided in by the people of that or any
other Commonwealth. Sir, her accoti
plished Secretary of State, the able Comp
troller of her financial interests, not less
remarkable for his stern integrity and frm
ness than for his solid talents, the Treasu
rer, the Attorney General, known here as
a man of great ability, and all others that
could be stricken down, have been swept
from the board; and no virgin timidity,
no coy reluctance, no holy horror of re
movals for political cause, no contempt for
the spoils of victory, have presented any
obstacle to the elevation of patriotic and
office hunting Whigs to the places vicated
by these removals. Indeed, sir, the pub
lic journals tell us that a multitude of can
didates were brought forward, and prepa
red to fill each and all of these stations."
. If this statement be correct, and we be
lieve it is, what unparalleled audacity do
the Whigs evince, in crying out oppres
sion! To the charge of removing their
opponents from office, and putting their
own partizans in their room, they and the
Administration are equally obnoxious. If
the Adiminigtration men deserve ihe odious
name of "Spoils party," so do the Whigs.
The latter repudiate the doctrine, that " to
the victors belong the spoils." Why not
repudiate the practice? Let the Whigs
cease to throw stones-they are not guilt
less. We are not the advocaies of pro
scription by any party. Honest, capable,
and well meaning men should not be re
moved for mere opinion's sake. This
would be ruthless persecution indeed! But
we see no reason why any government
should suffer a host of its worst and must
unsparing enemies to remain ia office,
merely, to throw obstacles in its way.
'. This would be a sort of political suicide."
We have thought it our duty to hold up
this picture of the Whigs, and the Van
Buren Democrats, to our readers, in order
that they might form a fair and impartial
opinion.

VERY LATE EttoM ENGLAND.-Th~e
packet steam ship Liverpool, Capt. Fay
rer, arrived'the 7th May, after a fine pas
sage of seventeen days,. from Liverpool,
Our dates by the Liverpool are, Lon
don to the evening of A pril 19th, and Liv.
erpool the 20th, both inclusive.
The intelligence by ibis arrival is of
high interest, and quite remarkable. One
of those sudden tturns in the progress of
events has taken place, whtich sometimes
occur to balle all calculation, and show the
folly of political prophecy. For months
p~ast our tidings from Europe have been
still of gathering clouds on the political
horizon, daily increasing in blackness and
in volume; and wearing an aspect soi
thtreatening that it see med almost itnpossi
ble but that they must be attended with
tempest and convulsion. In a moment,
as it were, we find them dispersed, and all
arottnd is sutnshine and gladness.
The hostile appearances between En
gland and our own country have entirely
disappeared--the o'ccasions of jealotusy
and bickering between France and Enig
land, and England and Russia,, have been
removed by courteous diplomacy-in the
East the alarming condition of affairs is
succeeded by such a change as almost to
tally removes the possibility of serious
trouble-in France the wisdom and firm
ness of the King have piloted him safely
through the difficulties of his position, and
the facdions projects of his etnemies are
scattered to the winds-the long pending
quarrel betweed Holland and Belgium is
peaceably adjusted-and in a word the
wvhole aspect of- European affairs has not
been for years more strongly indicative of
guiet and prosperity than at the present
wnoment..

CAMP OF '*ELBERGER'5PRA:RE.
' I have returned from Waterloo, the con
templated new seat of Government, which
I visited in company with General Burle
son. It is the most beatutiful and at the
same time the most stublime scene I evet
saw. I know that yout w'll be dlelightedl
with it, and I frequently wvished that you
were present to enjoy the scenery, as I
saw it. in all the majesty of nature atnd
the verdure of spring. The atmosphere
wvas charged with the most delightful per
(tume-and every shruh, every hill, and
every flower seemed to extend a welcome
to the weary traveller. I never expected
to realize your eloquent descriptiotn of~
Tlexas till I saw the landhs of the upper
Colorado. There are hundireds of the
most beautiful sities for building round the
ton.. level, an.1 Romeniself ,, ith all it
famous hills, could not have surpassed the
natural scenery of Waterloo. When I
have a better opportunity I will send you
a landscape of the spot atnd the surround
ing country.
The frontier is now quiet, and perfectly
safe. The valley from La Grange to the
mountains, presents a beautiful prospect to
(he eye of the traveller. All fears of an
Indiau invasion are now dissipated, and
the people are actively employed in culti
vatitig their crops. The inhabitants say
they have not felt as safe in three years.
Burleson has acted like a hero and a skil
ful officer. He has defeated the Indians
and routed the Mexicans, all without ex
pense to Government or injury to the plan
ting itterest.
From the Washington Gloh
SUB TREASURY SrsTEM IN CUBA.
Among the documents cunimunicated
to the Senate at the less session of Con
gress, was one from the Treasury, com
posed of answers received from the United
States consuls in many foreign countries,
in reply to queries addressed to them ott
the subjects of currency and revenue in the
different countries in which they resided.
Among the answers so received was an
elabmrate and carefully prepared commu
nication from Mr. Trist, the consul at Ha
vana, which,.besides answering the speci
fic inquiries addressed to him, entered
pretty largely into details, vouched by evi
dence, to show not only that a Government
may carry on: all its operations in hard
tmoney, butthata comnnnity may do so
also; and that credit, commerce, and in
dustry, may flourish to the highest degree
on such a currency, and without the knowl
.edge of paper money, or banks, and des
pite of the paralyzing influences of a des
potic Government, and the euervating ef
Iects of a tropical climate. As there is no
diffusion of information eqal to that which
is afforded by the columns of a newspaper:
we have thought that aportion of ours
might well lie employed in giving some
extracts from Mr Trist's communication.
convinced that such of our fellow-citizus
as believe.that "this Federal Government
was maznde by hard money men, and inten
ded to he a hard money Government,"
will read it with avidity and exultation,
and that even those who have been stri
ving to make it a paper money Govern
me.,t. eannot object to see a practical ar
gumient, bottomed wholly upon facts and
experience. that the Government may
subsist without dependence upon b hanks,
however indispensable they may consider
them as stimulators of trade.
Mr. Trist shows that the Island of Cuba
is h)out forty-three thousand square miles
in extent; that it has a population of about
a million of soulq, nearly one half slaves;
that its foreign and domestic commerce is
about forty-three millions of dollars, its
taxes fourteen millions, and its currencv
exclusively gold. We say exclusively
gold, for Mr. Trist says there is no silver
except for the two lowest denominations
of change, to wit; the bit and the half-bit,
being the eighth and the sixteenth of a dol
lar; all the rest is g6ld, consisting of the
doubloon, rated at seventeen dollars; ',he
ialf doubloon, the quarter doubloon, and
the eighth. With this crrency, and with
out the instrumentality of banks, Mr.Trist
preceeds to -show how the Governmen
manages its revenue of fourteen millons;
tow the merchants tanage their foreign
exporting and importing trade offorty three
millions. und how the people nanage their
daily transactions, exceeding, in all proba.
bility. a thousand millions of dollars per
annuim.
With reepect to the Government, Mr.
T. shows I, that the ns hole reventue of the
island is collected in gold and silver coin.
or more properly speaking in gold only,
as they have no silver except hits and half
hits for small change: 2, that the Govern
ment itself directs the kind of money to be
received; 3. that the tmonev is kept byv pub
lie treastirers: 4. that it is placed in vautlts
and coffers, secured by three locks (of dif
ferent sizes) the keys of wvhich are kept by
three difi'erent offieers; 5, that these oflicers
givebonds;6 tha~t the motteys are paid out
by the treasurer; 7, that the same identical
moaney is paid out for the Government
which was received for the Government,
no one beinig allowed to change it; 8, that
payments were made under the direction
of the intendant antd accountant general; 6,
that remittances were made by Govern
ment bills of exchange: 10, that no pubhlic
money could he used by an officer for his
own affairs, 11, that a monthly counating
of the public moneys took lacne. In this
way, Mr. Tr. shows that the Government
collected, kept, and disbursed its revenues,
and all without trouble, loss, or inconveni
ence, or dependence, or connection with
any, or upon any but its own oflicers. The
averace cost of the collection, keeping, andr
disbursing the igblic moneys, for the whole
islatnd, is less than 3& per cent.; the cost
for H avana and the district which contains
it is otnly 2j per cent. Losses and defal
cations are almost wholly unknown.

AMtERICAN DAGUER5sEcoPE.--A dis
covery similatr to that of M. Dagnerre, of~
F'rance, and Mr. Fox Talbot, of Etngland,
has been made by a gentleman or Cincin
tiatti. The Rtepublican newsapaper gives
the following accoutnt of this nesv mode of
makitng picturea.
"So:tue experimnents on the sabject of
photogenic drawing have beetn made by
Professor Locke of the Medical College
of Ohio, andI vith entire success. He pre
par-ed paper chietnically for this purpose,
placed it tunider somne astronomical dia

sun's rays. The new picture was in a few
minutes formed and removed, and a pro- 1
cess used by which the figures were perma- i
nently fixed. The specimens which the i
Doctor has left in our hands are in every I
respect satifactory. They look as though
the) bad been most carefully engraven.- I
The difficulty or mystery connected with
the matter, is to retain the picture which i
the light has formed on the pa per. This
has been overcome, and the curious may
satisfy thembelves with whti success, by I
examining a few snall specimens which I
we have left at Mr. Flash's book store. I
Misery tn China.-No literature in the
world teems with so many maxims of
morality as that of Chiua; it strives to in
culcate charity and benevolence; but we
are afraid that it has but little influencEon
the practice of the people. It is not an
uncummon sight, walking through the
streets of Canton, to see wretches iii the
most abject state of poverty, lying hud
died together on the cold pavemienit,where
they are left to die, unpitied and unreliev
ed by the thousands that pass by the.
Six of these miserable creatures, more
dead than alive, were lately seen in a
square lying together with three others al
ready become cor)ses, and one of the
poor wretches was seen to despoil Ihe dead t
of theirscanty covering to shelter her Iron I
the cold. Yet though thousands of their I
countrymen beheld their misery, not an
arm was stretched forth to give relief, nor ,
aI morsel of food was given them to prolong
their miserable existence. Such sights t
are any thing but uncommon in the I
crowded streets of Canton. t
SERtso.-Who does not feel the revivi- L
fVing effects of this balmy -spring time of
the year." OldWinterlike theSuilorKing,
William the Fourth, has deceased, full
of days, and stornms, and temllests,and the o
virgin Spritig, like the little Victoria, as- I
cends the throne, young, ardent.beautifil, I
blooming and beloved! Her crown is the I
first violet of ine season, twined with the i
tendrils of the vine; her sceptre is a rose
bush just blooming into life-her robe, the I
grass green mantle of the fields. The lit- I
tle spring birds herald her ascent to the t
throne, and at the sound all nature starts i
with joyful ghmdness! The mountain rill
bursts at one bound its icy fetters.and shouts f
for liberty-then rushes to the vale below i
to meet its summer friends, who bring t
chaplete of leaf and flowers to greet its i
return, and strew its path with opening I
blossoms. The sky smiles in gladness I
fromi its eyes of azure, as it dashes away (
the tears and sorrowings of winter-the r
sun-heame fall softer and purer on the I
earth-the twilight lengthens, and seems r
to linger, loth to leave the world-as lov- t
ers bid good night again and again, while i
each adien affords fresh converse, and pro
tracts the parting, which must cone at
last!
Every thing breathes of light and life I
and perfume-the hill--the field, the
grove-sky and land-earth, and water,
are all sweeter and balmier. To-day- a

born of spring and sun shine, is cradled

Go then atnong the fields-inhale the

Wahingon-The following analysis of
thme epochs in the life of General WVashing
ton, is made out from Sparks' life of Wash
ington, which has just appeared.
Geerge Washington attendeit school till
he was sixteetn years oldI. From sixteen
to nineteen his time was spent in survey
ing, part of the time in a private and part
of the timte in a public capacity. From
nineteen to twenity, lie was absent several
months in the West Indies, with a ick
brother, and the remainder of the time at
hotme,settling his deceased brother's estate.
From twenty to twenty-six he wvas itn the
French and Indian war, At twenty-six
he was married, and residletd as a private
citizen on his estate at Mount Vernon, till
near forty-three., At this age he was
chosenCommander-in-Chiefof the Atneri
can army,"which station he fheld eight
years, and retired at the age *of fifty-onie,
to Mount Vertnon. From fifty-one to fiftyi
seven he passed at Mount Vernon in ag-1
ricuiltural pursuits. At the age of fifty
seven he was chosen President of the
United States, which office he field eight,
years, and retired againi to his favorite
pursuits at Mount Vernoni, at the ago of
sixty-five.' Iere he resided till his decease
-three years. He died at the age of
sixty-eight.
Cuntous RvR.-In the province of
Andalttla, in Spain, there is a river of the
most extraordinar-y and sitngtilar qualities.
it rises in the Sierra Mountains, empties
itself into the Mediterranean near the
town of Huelva. and is named "TatI:Tt
TO," from the tinge of its waters, which
are as yellow as topaz, hardening the sand
anti petrifying it in a most extraordinary
manner. If u stone happens to fall in and
rest upon another they both become in a
year's time perfectly tinited and congluttin
ated. All thme plants on the bankis are;
withered by its waters whenever thev
overflow, as are also the root's of tree~s
which it dyes of the samne hue as itself.
No kintd of verdure will come where its
wvater reaches.nor fish live in its stream.-1
When given to cattle to drink, it kills
worms in them; but in general no animal
wilt drink it, except goats, whose flesh,
neveribeless, has an excellent flavor,
These singultat- properties-continue till
other rivers run into it, nod alter its nature;
for when it passes by Niebia; it is not dif
ferent from other rivers, and falls into the
Mediterrantean six feagtues lower dowvn, at
the town of Hluelva, where it is two leagues
broad, andt adminits tif large vessels, which
come ufp the river as high as San .Juandel
Puerto, three leaguecs above Huelva.
