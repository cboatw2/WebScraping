LETTER FROM BISHOP SOULE.
T« iba Editor oTUm WNtoro Christian Advocate.
Dear Brother,—I deeply regret that since the
publication ef my first letter in the Western Chris
tian Advocate, new acasions of contention and
i strife hare occurred, which, I fear will widen the
breach between the north and the south, and wea
ken that charity which is one of the strongest
bonds of union between the members of the house
> ■' hold of faith. I had indulged the strong hope that,
£ ‘ although the Church should divide according to
the plan adopted with so much unanimity and kind
Christian fseling by the General conference, there
^ would still remain a broad ground of Scriptural
truth, and fellowship, and enterprise, on which both
the north and the south might meet together, not
to provoke each other to wrath and strife by con
j- T tentions about the civil and domestic institutions of
the country, but rather to “lovo and good wocjts.”
But painful as the result of this controversy
must be, under tho moBt favorable circumstances,
in the separation of tho Church, if it could be stay
ed even here, and ^ease to agitate either division,
although our power of doing good may be diminish
ed by the dissolution of our union, still there will
be an ample 'field for labor and enterprise on either
Side of the line of demarkation. And if ministers
and people will desist from the contention which
has resulted in their separation and all others
which do not tend to peace and godliness, and
unite their counsels and efforts to promote the in
terests of the Redeemer’s kingdom and the salva
tion of the souls of men, both at home and abroad,
we may, with the help of God, still go on with our
great work, although, in some measure, shorn of
*\ our former strength. With this view, I would en
treat brethren, especially the ministers, on whom
much depends in the present state of things, to
cultivate the spirit of kindness and charity toward
each other. Let not the bonds which unite belie
vers together as members of the body of Christ, be
broken asunder. Suffer me to beseech both the
north and the Bouth not to regard the line which
divides them as a boundary between belligerent
powers, contending for victory over each other ;
but rather as a line of division between the most
. friendly states, exercising their distinct jurisdic
tions in amity and peace with each other ; or, as
the boundary of plantations, where the proprietors
cultivate their respective ground in perfect quiet
■. ude and harmony.. And to each department suffer
me to say, Be at peace among yourtehes, and re
move not the ancient land marks which your fathers
have set up.
bui many oi my menus win prouaoiy oe sur
prised and, it may be, grieved, that I speak of the
division of the Church rather as a matter of histo
rical record than as an event dependent upon fu
ture contingencies, and which consequently may
be avoided ; especially as these communications
appear at a period when our official papers are al
most weekly presenting us with plans of compro
mise, on which it is supposed the difficulty may
be adjusted and settled, and the union of the body
/' preserved. To those who entertain this opinion, I
can only say, that it would be among the most joy
ful events of my whole life, could I see this diffi
culty, which has so long and so deeply disturbed
the peace and harmony of the Church, settled up
on such a firm basis as to secure to the ministry
and membership of every grade, the quiet and un
disturbed possession of those equal rights and pri
vileges, which, in my opinion, the economy of Me
thodism, as developed in our excellent form of
Discipline, in conformity to the civil institutions
and laws of our country, has defined hnd settled.
-\ If this can be done, and sufficient guards be pro
vided to secure the Church against further agita
tion of the subject in her official bodies, especially
the General and annual conferences, it should be
hailed by every lover of peace, by every Methodist
preacher and member, as a most auspicious era in
the history of Methodism. But I have seen no
proposition of compromise, which, in my deliberate
” judgment, is calculated to accomplish so desirable
an end.' Indeed, as far as I rocollect, every plan,of
compromise which, has been proposed, contem
plates a caste in the constitutional eldership of the
Church with regard to equal right and privilege.
On such a basis, I certainly have no hope of a per
manent union. When I consider the mailer of dif
ference between the north and the south—the po
sition of the delegates on either side in the latg
General conference—the determination with which
both supported their position—-the fact that ten
thousand petitioners were before the conference,
- praying that measures might be taken to free the
Church from all connection with slavery, and to ex
clude from the offices under the control of that bo
dy all who wero thus connected—the acts of the
> conference in the premises—the subsequent course
both 6f the north and the south—the fact that near
ly one half of the entire membership of the Church
is in the slaveholding states, claiming under the
provisions of the Discipline, as ministers and mem
bers. equal rights and privileges with their nor
thern brethren—and the extraordinary unanimity
tyith which the southern section of tiie Church has
< ‘ sustained all the essential points in the position,
>' declaration, protest, and address of iier delegates,
- I confess I have no hope that any plau of compro
, mise, which has come under my observation, wiH
operate to settle the controversy and preserve the
rX, unity of the body. ,

THE NEW CHURCH IN WILMINGTON,
j Yes, thanks be to God, there is once more a Me
thodist church erected in Wilmington. That it may
be fightly understood what peculiar reason there
>,: is for devout gratitude and thanksgiving on this
• , occasion, it will be.necessary to go back, by way of
reminiscence, and gather up a few items of the
-■ past, in connection with the history of the M.
E. Church in this place. Although some men
tion is made of Wilmington in the minutes as
early as 1784, Methodism, by name at least, was
almost utterly unknown here, until about the year
< ; 1794, when those two faithful disciples of the
Lord Jesus, William Meredith and Jesse Jennett,
were moved of God to come and take up their a
bode in Wilmington. It was, indeed, a marvel
lous ant| blessed coincidence, and, as subsequent
events proved, of God, indeed, that these two men,
1 strangers to each other’s very name and character,
yet so alike in spirit and purpose, should, at the
very same time, determine, with the help of God,
to unfurl the gospel banner in Wilmington. True
yoke-fellows were they, and, working with one
heart and mind, together, accomplished a work,
which, singly and alone, might have been Well
*• giyen up as hopeless. One, long since, has been
called to liia exceeding great reward, the other
■liTl lives .as a venerable connecting link between
those times and the present, the patriarch of the
placet the revered and beloved of all,—for who
does not, in Wilmington, be he saint or sinner,
honour dear, good, old father Jennett 1
Last Sunday was a great day for this dear old
saint of the Lord, a*, in truth, it was for the most
of us in Wilmington. Most of us knew, for who
of us had’nt, at least, heard all about it from father
Jennett, how that one Win. Meredith, at that time
a follower of Harnett, came, led by the spirit of
the Lord, as a missionary of the gospel, to Wil
mington. He gathered, at first, a few colored
people around him, but the public authorities, jea
lous of his ministry, thought effectually to put a
stop to it, by a law prohibiting the holding meet
ings with colored people after sunset. Meredith
arose before sunrise, and collected, a t that early
hour, his little band of worshippers; the public
authorities, however, for this imprisoned him in
the common jail, but, like Garretsou, Lee, and
others of sainted memory, he held forth the word,
long and loud, from his prison windows all day,
and nearly all night, assembling such crowds of
people round the jail, and causing, thereby, so
much commotion and excitement in the whole
community, that they were soon fain to get rid of
their troublesome lodger. On his liberation, what
think ye, says father Jennett, was the first thing
he did J Why, assemble the colored people for
worship that very evening ! But, no man, • any
more, laid hands upon him ; for, open his mouth
he would, and they prudently considered he
had better be allowed the freedom of speech any
where, than at the jail windows, for no where else
did they apprehend be would gather such attentive
and crowded congregations. Straitway, then, he
proceeded to the erection of a house of worship,
ou, what he consid ered, a more eligible site, than
even where the jail stood! It was built on what
he called, and what still goes by the name of
“ Zion’s Hill.” But the malice of his persecutors
still pursued him. His little meeting-house, that
had gone up in the midst of prayers and tears, was
very soon after its completion the mark for the
demoniacal vengeance of the incendiary. But, on
its smoking ruins, he took his stand, and there
preached the goepel of the grace of God to the
greatly astonised, and, at length, sympathising,
multitude. A kind-hearted gentleman, stepping
up to him from the assembled crowd, said, “friend,
you had better spare your feelings, your mind is
not in a proper state to preach at this time.”
“ Sir,” said Meredith, ‘‘ I carry not my sermons
in my pocket. I keep them in my heart, and the
fire hasn’t reached there.” Soon, a temporary ta
bernacle, and, then, another place of worship was
erected by the undaunted Meredith. A few white
members now began to unite themselves with the
little, despised, band of colored people. But, the
days of the devoted Meredith were now about
shortly drawing to a close. And, “ what will be
come of my people, my poor people,” said he to
'his fellow labourer Jennett, “ will you consent to
go in and out before them, as I have endeavoured
to do, my brother ?” But, the discreet advice of
Jennett was, that they should be attached, as a
church, to some established body of Christians.
“Then,” said Meredith, ‘‘I do solemnly bequeath
this little church to bishop Asbury, in trust for the
M- E. Church. The Methodists are the peoplo
most after iny own heart, and, I believe, they are
they, under God, who are to bo most effectual in
carrying on the great work of evangelizing the
world. A work has* begun here,”, said Meredith,
“ which shall go on when I have passed into eter
nity, and a church is established here, which I
expect to look down upon, with joy, from the shin
ing courts of glory.” Meredith died, and the
wailings of his poor eolored flock was a requiem
loud and long and glorious for him. The seed
sown had not fallen by the way-side, but on good
ground, and sprang up soon, in abundant increase.
The word of God grew mightily and prevailod.
The little church built by Meredith might, soon,
no longer contain the people, for multitude. An
other house, larger and more commodious was
then erected, on the same sacred site. This was
the church so recently destroyed by fire ; and,
now, on this “ Zion’s Hill,” this present place of
worship, just completed, is the fourth, (besides
the tabernacle of Meredith,) that has been erect
ed to the name, and for the worship of Almighty
God.
A great day it was tor Hie Methodist people in
Wilmington, and a glad day, when the scattered
flock, after two years ol'inconvenienco and discom
fort, once more assembled together in a bolter and
more commodious place of worship than they ever
had before. This fine new church besides being
very commodious in its substantial basement with
Sunday school and class rooms, and preachers’
office and library, is built in very beautiful and
accurate taste:—a model, in this respect, for our
Methodist churches generally; constructed after
the ordor of the noble Doric, plain but inasBive and
dignified in its appearance ; its stately colonnade
in front, of grave sandstone, striking the beholder
as an elegant specimen of architectural skill. Im
mediately on entering, the eye is at once riveted
on the motto above, and encircling the altar, in
large golden characters in “ basso relievo,” ‘‘For
mine house shall be called an house of prayer for
all people.” It formed the text for the dedica
tion sermon, preached in the forenoon by the Rev.
Whitefoord Smith,—Presiding Elder of the Dis
trict. In the course of his remarks, he touchingly
alluded (and there were fewf dry eyes while he did
so) to the last sermon he had preached about two
years ago, as near sons possible to where he then
stood, when the cry of fire was given, and soon
“ their beautiful house where their fathers had
worshipped, was destroyed by fire and all their
pleasant things laid waste,” but, how, that God
had given them even a better house and kept them
from harm while they had worshipped in the taber
nacle, aud now by Ilia love had brought them
safely to Ilia fold again. The Pastor of the Church,
tho Rev. Wm. Martin, in the afternoon, took his
text irom ooiomon s aoutcalory prayer ior me tern
pie. He remarked the striking though undesigned
coincidence of the dedication of this temple, with
that of Solomon,—both taking place on the 16th
day of the month, and u the feast"—(ours, a pro
tracted meeting) continuing until the 23rd, on
which day, the people in Solomon’s time, “ went
away into their tents glad and merry in heart for
the goodness that God had showed unto David, to
Solomon and to Israel, His people." Brethren,
pray for us, that we, in Wilmington, may go from
! our feast” on next Sabbath, “ the twenty-third”
“ glad and merry of heart for tho goodness GoJ
hath showed unto-Israol, His people.” The Rev.
Dr. McCabe of Richmond, at night, preached
from these solomu words, “ for the redemption of
the soul is precious, and it ceaseth for everand,
we trust, not without great and powerful effect on
the immense audience before him. The congre
gations all day, were oversowing. The people
seemed to be flocking aa dove* to their windows.
■ - ■ ;y '"‘kv ■

The first tune In the morning was “ Old Hundred.”
We have a delightful choir in Wilmington, one of
the fineit I know any where, and generally, it
a wells in its full tide of song even above the music
of the congregation,—but at that time you could
catch it but at intervals as one single note of silve
ry sweetness. Much Ss I love line music, 1 con
fess, there and then, I didn’t regret, tl^t old
Harry Merrick’s dear old cracked voice, from the
gallery, was heard above all tbe rest. Nobody
listened to it but felt, there were notes there, that
had gone right up, to make up the heavenly diap
ason. To the Christian’s heart, at least, ’twas
"harmony, ’twos heavenly harmony.”
But, ere wo close, we hope, this not too tedious
detail, it must not be forgotten to be made montion
of, that very oariy in the morning, ere it was yet
day, father Jennet met the coloured people in the
basement for the purpose (as haB been his wont
these many years) of expounding to them the Scrip
tures. Oh, said he, the tears of joy streaming
from his eyes, “how Meredith*—is looking down,
sure enough, from the courts of glory this day.”

Where stood the old burnt building, now, doth stand
A fair new edifice:and, gathering, thero,
Throng after throng are seen, band after band,
In anxious expectancy, all hastening are
To worship or to gaze, in that new house of prayer.
Yea, ’tis a goodly building, lair to see, ,

To Thee Almighty God of all, to thee, •
Thy grateful people now, do give away . >r
A Temple, wherein Thou mayest deign to stay.

For ’tie a holy place ; and, now, begin
The solemn services, the praise and prayer;
The rising aspiration and the tailing tear.
For many thoughts, now crowd on many hearts,
Scenes of the past, associations dear,
All, all are rising, Grace itself imparts
A trembling joy, they bless, and yet they fear, '
Perchance, should God not show his presence here.
They bless him, that he’s made his word to grow
And multiplied their numbers, so that where
They few and small, onceworship’d, new, no mors
May half contain them, so increased are
They that go up unto the house of prayer.
They bless lor this, and, yet, with tearful eye,
How oft’ they turn and ponder o’er the days,
The blessed days, in the old church gone bye

Sure, every one did feel, bow true and just
Was God in all his ways, when first they stood
In that vast temple and its concourse viewed :
That temple fitted for his ’biding place,
The sanctuary of his pure and sacred word ; - 1 *

Wool growing and cotton manufacturin') in Mis
sissippi.—The following is from the Natchez Courier of
the 11th ult:
“Wo were yesterday shown, by our valued friend,
Samuel T. McAllister, Esq., a couple of samples of
wool sent to him by Mr. James Brown, of Yazoo
county. The wool was of the finest, softest tex
ture, far surpassing any we have ever seen. We were
surprised when told that such an article grew in Mis
sissippi, where, until a few years past, but little atten
tion had been given to such products, the cultivation of
cotton having occupied the entire time of our farmers.
Mr. Brown sends Mr. McAllister a bale of wool weigh
ing 400 lbs., of excellent quality, which he desires to
exchange for cotton goods of Mr. M.’s manufacture, and
writes that he will be able in a few months to send him
a bale of wool of superior quality.
“It is certainly pleasing to see that our planters are
beginning to take an interest in Mr. McAllisters enter
prise of manufacturing, and to see what advantage, pa
tronizing him will be to them. Mr. M. is progressing
finely with his factory, having as much employment as
his force can despatch, nnd making various articles of a
I quality inferior to none in the Union."
' S|NopLAR.—The Winyaw Intelligencer says—Du
ring the gale which visited our section of country a few
weeks since one of the ferry-men, at North Santee Fer
ry, fell out of a canoe, in which he had gone to the South
Ferry, and was drowned. His body was searched for,
but could not be found, until some six or eight days af
ter ; when an enormous shark was caught near Cedar
Island, and on being opened the unfortunate negro was
found in its stomach, with a bottle of whiskey in his
pocket. The negro had no marks of violence whatever
(saving a few scratches on his forehead) on his body.
It is supposed that after being drowned he was carriej
by the current to the (aland and the shark swallowed
him.
u Bupposeu oy some mat me smarts may nave come
in to make a harbour, anil was near the ferry , at the
time. We have not heard how the Shark was taken.
The fact of the occurrence is given us by one of the
Santee missionaries, and may be relied on. The wind
was very high and prevented the arrival of the Charles
ton mail on the 5th—an occurrence which has not hap
pened at the Santee ferry but four times in the last thirty
years, if our memory be correct.
Benevolence.—The following amusing freak of an
insane patient is related by Dr. Earl of the Blooming
dale Asylum in the January number of the Journal of
Insanity:
An insane lady in the middle age of life, a peaceable
quiet creature, with a heart overflowing with "the milk
ofhuman kindness,” occupied a room in the Asylum.
She had a large quarto Bible, which when she was not
reading from it, laid upon the table. One morning, I
was somewhat surprised on finding her seated in an
arm chair, the table in her lap, and the Bible on the
floor. Asking* her the cause of this new arrangement,
she told me that "the table was so tired with holding the
Bible that she was 'tending it,’” for the purpose of giv
ing it some relief. This process was often repeated af
terwards, and the benevolence that prompted it, soon
extended to the bedstead, to which she frequently gave
opportunities of “rest,” by holding up, for hours in^suo
ceseion, the corners of the bed, and the superincumbent

Example OF THf Prbubiht Sleet.—Mr.- Polk the.
Preaident Elect, arrived at Washington on Thureday of
laal week.—While in Cincinnati, the previoua week, he
remarked that he intended, on leaving (hat city, to apend
(lie following Sabbath in Wheeling; for, aaid ha, “it will
neither comport with my convenience or inclination to
travel, or to receive company, on that day.” The ice
detained him by the wuy, eo that the boat did not reach
Wheeling till Sunday evening. lie waa conveyed to
the Virginia Houae, where a large crowd aaaembled,
clamoroua to eee the Preaident, but. he cent them word
that it wae not convenient for him to eee them to-day,
(Sunday,) but he would do eo to-morrow, Monday, till
13 o'clock.
A correspondent bf the Journal of Commerce aaya :
“The Preaident ie very temperate in all things. 1 have
not seen him taste a drop of anything since he bas been
upon his journey, but cold water.
A Great Cotton Mill.—A mill has been recently
erected in Cincinnati, for the manufacture of cotton cloth,
styled the “Franklin Factory.” It is 154 feet long by S3
feet w ide, aud five stories high. Some idea of the busi
ness to be carried on in this establishment may bo form
ed from the fact that 310 looms and 9312 spindles will
be constantly kept in operation. It is expected that for
ty thousand yards of sheeting will be made each week.
At this rate, if regularly kept going, it will turn out about
two millions of yards of sheeting per annum j and to do
this jt will employ three hundred persons. The proprie
tors of this extensive factory are Messrs. Harkness,
Strader dt Fosdick.
A aoon Compost ron Sandt Land.—Take 10 loads
of stable or barn-yard manure, 5 loads of clay, 10 bush
els ofashes, and 20 bushels of lime, mix the whole well
together, and let it remain in a pile a few days, .turn it
over, when it will be fit to apply to the land.
The above quantity will make a better dressing for
an acre of sand than twenty, or twenty-five loads of
stable or barn-yard manure alone, and will last longer.
Let any one who may doubt,- try it, and they will be
convinced of the truth of what we say.
Not Bad.—A Methodist preacher, expounding op
his own authority, in a country village, remarked that
“commentators did not agree with him.” Next day he
received a basket of kidney potatoes from one of his rus
tic disciples, who remarked that “since common laturs
did not agree with him, he had taken the liberty to pre
sent him with some best kidnfcy taturs.”
A Wood-Sawing Humane Institution is actually in
operation at Cincinnati. A company of philanthropists
purchase great quantities of wood, stow it away in a
large yard, and there all who are in want are employed
as sawyers. The citizens buy their fuel at the yard in
such lengths, sizes and quantities, as they desire.
Coinage.—During the past year 483,300 pieces in
gold, amounting to $3,010,000, and 2,966,000 pieces in
silver, amounting to $1,198,600, have been coined at the
U. S. Mint in New Orleans, Total number of pieces

COKESBURY FEMALE INSTITUTE.
The Trustees having secured the services of Mr*.
Scott and Mia* Brvmlow for another year, the exer
cises of the Institute were resumed on the let of this.
Month. From the long acquaintance the Public has
had with them, and the Institutions of this place, and
their many advantages, we deem it unnecessary to say
more than give our present rates of tuition and board.
Our scholastic year of ten months is divided into two
Sessions—the first commencing llie first school day in
February, and ending the last school day in June; the
second the first school day in July, to the last school
day in November.
The literary department will be divided into three
classes,—the 1st 86, the 2d $10, and the 3d 814 per
Session. An extra charge of $15 per session for in
struction on the Piano; Guitar, the same; use of the
Piano, 8£ per session. Pupils will only be charged
from the time they commence until the end of a Session.
Good board can be bad from 87 «o $8 per month.

This valuable Establishment was finished in 1840, and in
highly improved. Tbe waters are medicinal and excellent, and

Induced by the salubrity of the climate, its fine waters, and tkn
