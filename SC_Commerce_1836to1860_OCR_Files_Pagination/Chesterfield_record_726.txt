TIIE INDIAN'S OMNION OK JOK SMITH.
The Indians have the greatest possible contempt |
for Joseph ?Sinilli, and denominate him a Tslic
?11;. u* urhich signifies a rascal. Nor have j
nahwav( ? ?
other false prophets risen more highly in their estimation.
A few years since, that notorions deceiver,
Matthias, made his appearance one evening
at the door of Keokuk's (chief of a neighboring
tribe) 4 waikcon,' or cabin.
He wore a long beard, which was parted on one J
side of his chin ; a long gun was on his shoulder, j
and a red sash around his waist.?Keokuk do- j
manded who he was, to which question Matthias
replied, that lie was Jesus Christ, the only true
Cod, and that he was come to gather the Indians, i
who were the seed of Israel. 44 Well," says Keo- i
kuk, who is a very dignified man, 44 perhaps j*ou '
are Jesus Chr!.?t and perhaps you arc not. If you
are Jesus Christ you cannot be killed. If you are !
not Jesus Christ, you are a rascal, and deserve to I
be shot. Look at these two fine rific pistols;
they were made in New York, thry never miss !
their aim. Now sec me sound them with the
ramrod.?They have a tremendously heavy charge.
Now I point them at you. Now I am going to !
fire." At this Matthias suddenly bolted, being !
unwilling that his claims should he tested by so !
novel striking a mode of theological argu. j
meat.

The American Character.?The Americans j
are by nature frank, brave, cordial, hospitable and j
affectionate. Cultivation and refinement seem but j

qualities iu a most remarkable decree winch ren- ,

was so won upon as by this class; never yielded j
up my full confidence and esteem so readily and j
pleasurubly as to them; never can again make, |
in half a year, so many friends, for whom, I seem ,
to entertain the regard of half a life. The qualities
are natural, J implicitly believe, to the whole
jK-ople. That tliey are, however, sadly sapped,
blighted in their growth among the m;:ss, and
that there are influences at work which endanger

of their healthy restoration, is a truth that ought

there it may lie, with a greater infusion of the

contention in reference to appearances, and the I
display of wealth and costly living. The ladies
are singularly beautiful.
Before I left New York I made arrangements
for securing a passage home in the George Washington
packet ship which w.is advertised to sail
in June; that being the month in which I had I
determined, if prevented by no accideut, in the
course of mv rumblings, to depart from Ameri?
I never thought that going back to England, j
returning to all who were dear to me, and to pur- I
suits that have insensibly grown to be a part of j
my nature, I could have felt so much sorrow as I
endured, when I parted at lust, on board this ship, ;

A Native Chieftain.?There chanced to be i 1
on Ixiard this boat, in addition to the usual dreary . 1
crowd of passengers, one Pitchlynn, a chief of the j
Choctaw tribe of Indians, who sent in his card \ |
to me, and with whom I had the pleasure of a '
A lon<* conversation. I ;
i
He spoke English perfectly well, though lie had j '
not begun to learn the language, he told me, until j
he was a young man grown. He had read many , '
books, and Scott's poetry appeared to have left a ! 1
strong impression on his mind, especially the open- J <
ing of " The Lady of the Lake," and the great t
battle scene in " Marmion," in which, no doubt, I
from the congeniality ot the subjects to his own '
pursuits and tastes, lie hid great interest and do- I
light. lie appeared to understand correctly all lie 1
had read, and whatever fiction had enlisted his s
sympathy in its belief, had done so keenly and <
earnestly, I might almost say fiercely, ile was <
dressed in our ordinary evcry-day costume, which
hung about his. fine figure loosely, and with indif. . I
fcrent grace. Un my telling him that I regretted <
not to t^e liun :u las ownamre, uc mrtv* uj> uu> >
ight arm fur .1 moiricnt, astliough he was brandish-1
ug s?<*nic heavy weapon, and answered, as he let it
all again, tli.it his race were losing many things i ,
reside the dress, and would soon lie seen upon the j 4
sarth no more ; but lie wore it at home, he added, |
jroudly. J
He told nic tliat he had been away from his J
101 nc, west of the -Mississippi, seventeen months; j
md was now returning, lie had been chiefly at. r
Washington, on some negotiation* pending between [ g
Ins tribe and the Government, which were not set- j(
tied yet (he said in a melancholy way,) and he
feared never would be; for what could a few poor
Indians do, against such well skilled men of business
as the whites ? t
lie had no love for Washington; tired of towns 1
and cities very soon ; and longed for the forest and i
the prairie. t
I asked him what he thought of Congress ? He j
answered, with a smile, that it wanted dignity in
an Indian's eyes.
' \ *
He would very much like, lie saiu 10 see i^ug- ;
land before lie died ; and spoke with much interest ,
about the great things to be seen there. When I ,
told liim of that chamber in the Ilritish Museum <
wherein are preserved household memorials of a
race that ceased to be, thousands of years ago, he
was very* attentive, and it was not hard to sec (
that he had u reference in his mind to the gradual ]
fading away of his own jicoplc. .
This led us to speak of Mr. Catlin's gallery, ,
which he praised highly, observing, that his own ,
portrait was among the collection, and that all the (
likenesses were "elegant." Mr. C'oojkt, lie said, ,
had painted the red man well; and so would I, lie (
knew, if I would go home with him and hunt buf- ,
falocs, which he was quite anxious I should do.? |
When 1 told him that supposing I went, I should (
not be very likely to damage the burtalocs much,
he took it as a great joke, and laughed heartily.
lie was a remarkably handsome man; some
years past forty, I should judge, with long black
Jiair, and acquiiiuc nose, broad cheek hones, a sun. i
barm complexion, and a very bright, keen, dark, j
and piercing eye. There were but twenty thous- i
and uf the I'hoe taws left, he said, and their num. !
bcr was decreasing every day. A few of his bro- J
tlier chiefs had been obliged to become civilized,
and to make themselves acquainted with what the
whites knew, for it was their only chance of cxis.
tcnec. Ilut they were not many; and the rest
were as they always had been. He dwelt on this,
and said several times that unless they tried to assimilate
themselves to their conquerors, they must
be swept away before the strides of civilized socic{y
When we shook hands at parting, I told hiin'he
must come to England, as he longed to sec the
land so much ; that I should hope to see him there,
one day, and that 1 could promise he would be i j
well received, and kindly treated. He was cvi- J
dently pleased by this assurance, though lie re- |
joined, with a good-humored smile and an arch shake
of iiis head, that the English used to he
very fond of the red men when they wan'ed their >
help, but had not cared much for them since.
He took his leave; as stately and complete a j (
gentleman of Nature's making as I ever beheld; j
and moved among the pcop'c in the boat another i
kind of being. ,
We learn I'rmii the Frederick Citizen

to the CilVct, that Mr. Latta, of this district, pro- i
duccd from ofT two and tlirc<? quarter acres of J
land, which has been cleared 1G years, 3u0 bushels |
of shelled corn. One measured acre of the above,
gave 10J bushels and 11 quarts. Our down coun- !
try friends, who arc so much in the habit of brag. |
ging on corn, wheat, potatoes, turnips, and beets, \
would do well to bcrt this before they say much j
more on the subject of agricultural wonders. This ,
was not done for a premium, not coming under
the provisions of the Society, and may therefore
be looked uj?on as a necessary result of paying
proper attention to our old lands.

38 bushels to the acre, is very appropriately hand,

Mr. Editor :?It may be seen, at any time, that
the streets of our town arc now nearly as much
thronged with hogs and horses, as before the stock
law was pissed. And 1 would rcsjicctfuliy ask
llie honorable Town Council, if this is meting
out rqu il justice to the citizens of the town ??
How does the case stand ? On two separate occasions
have the sentiments of the citizens been
asked and obtained on the propriety of the law,
and both times it was expressed in favor of the law.
At once the greater portion of those that owned
hogs, disposed of them, some in one way ami some
in another?many however at a sacrifice. If now ,
tlie law is to be considered a dead letter and in no
way binding, it is to be hojied the town authorities
will in so many words say so, so that all the citi- j
zens may lie placed on the same footing. As it ^
now ojicrates, the restriction is a bounty to those
who disregard and violate the law, at the expense
if the law-respecting and law-abiding portion of
[he community. The general plea assigned, is
that the officer invested with this business neglects
bis duty. This is an idle and ridiculous reason ; for
icrtainly an officer can be got who assuredly will
Jo his duty, and that faithfully and promptly. The
Tcncral feeling of the community calls upon the
Town Council to act decidedly "in this matter, and
:o give notice that all may violate the law with>ut
injury, or to have it properly enforced.

The last night of ihc prisoner was spent in pre. i
aring an answer to Governor Seward's. letier,!
nd vindicat:ng hiinsrlf from the guilt of wilful |
inrder. This letter was scaled, to he kept for his !
li;M until it shall Ik; old enough to understand its
ontcnts.
The Rev. Dr. Anthon was for a long time in
ie cell with the prisoner, and left him alone to his j
wn reflections at about 10 o'clock. A few miu-1
tes before II o'clock he was visited by his coun- j i
1, David Graham, Robert Emmet, and Dudley j
eldeti, Esijrs., who remained in his cell about J
ulfan hour. Dr. Anthon and Samuel Colt now I i
itcicd the cell, and made preparations for the j ^
is oner's marriage. Ilis brother soon left the ' ]
prison, and a? Un minutes More twelve returned
\v ill) 11 iss IJcniihaw and John Howard I*ajne, ill
whoso presence, whh the addition of (he counsel,
Justice Mcrritt and the idieriff, the marriage ceremony
was performed in that narrow cell by the
Rev. Dr. AnlJion. What a bridal scene! The
marriage hull a prison cell! The prospect fiom
the bridal window the bridegroom's gallows, on
which he was sentenced to i'ic a felon's death in a
few short hours. What an anticipation for a bride!
Ere the set of sun to mourn over the ignoininous
grave of him with whom her reputation* and for.
tunes were just linked by the sacred ties 0i love
and matrimony !
After this ceremony, the prisoner was left alone
with his bride for the space of nearly an hour.?
Their parting scene called forth the tears of spectators
who Were all unused to the melting mood.
He kissed her, strained her to his bosom- for the
last time as she left his door, and with eager eyes
and an aching heart, watched her receding form
as she faded from his sight.
At Colt's request John Howard Payne and
Lewis (iaylord Clarke, his personal friends, weie
admitted to bid him a final adieu. They remained
in his cell hut a ft*w minutes, and then with tear?
took their farewell leave. Samuel Colt, then went
through the same painful and affecting scene, and
left the prison with Caroline Colt. The prisoner
now desired to sec the sheriff and emphatically denied
to him any intention to kill Adams, asserted
with much feeling his innocence, and begged the
sheriff to postpone the execution. The sheriff told
hi in it was impossible to delay any longer ; that
he must prepare himself to die at four o'clock.?
He now set his watch by the sheriff's, and requested
to see the clergyman. Dr. Anthon went into
his cell and remained about ten minutes, exhorting
him, at parting, to die with Christian fortitude.?
The prisoner seemed calm and determined, and
said he was prepared fo (lit? with firmness.
The prisoner now desired to be left to himself
until his last minute?his door was locked r?t half
past two. A few minutes before three one of the
deputy sheriffs opened the door to see that all was
right, when Colt was walking his cell. lie was
i not seen again alive.
| The excitement among the spectators within
I the prison walls, and the crowd without, had ncar|
ly reached its height. The spectators began to
gather round the gallows. The officers, with
theirstaves,arrange^ themselves in two lines, forming
an oj>cning through the crowd for the passage
of the prisoner. Some began now to look frequently
at tiieir watches, and those who had not
watches as frequently to inquire the time.
It wants now but fifteen minutes of the fatal j
hour. Every spectator has obtained his place and
stands with eyes fixed upon the corner round which
the culprit is expected to turn and pass up to the
gallows, with the halter on his neck, and his attendants,
the clergyman, and the sheriff and dep.
uty, through the long narrow way formed by the
mass of eager sjicetators on each side.
" How much time is there left ?" was the common
inquiry ; and the answer was" Only ten minutes.'1
Within the prison yard all is still. The officers
on duty arc silent; not a man moves. The stillness
of death prevails round the gallows. But
without the prison walls the crowd, which had
now increased to a great number, and which had
throughout the day been horribly boisterous, sent
I up a continuous and dissonant shout as of ten
thousand voices.
It seemed like the hungry cry of an army of
wild beasts, eager for their prey.
I At length, within five minutes of the appointed
time, three or four men arc seen running round the
corner to which all eyes are instantly turned, and
the stillness within is broken by the eager cry of
14 There comes Colt!" 44 Colt!" 44 Colt!"
Mr. Campbell of the Folicc Court, the foremost
of the men who came round the corner, runs up to
Justice Matscll and says, 44 Colt is dead." He
runs up to the line where the prisoner was expected
to pass, exclaiming 44 Colt is dead ; Colt has
made way with himself." This announcement
seemed to be received as though it were the echo
of a presentiment in every breast; and every i
one seemed to say with the kccj>cr of the prison,
j 44 As I thought."
While the crowd was rushing to the prison door,
and while vague rumors were afloat that Colt had
cut his throat, that he had taken Prussic acid or
some other poison, and while every mind seemed >
I wrought up to its utmost pitch with the excitement i
of disapjjointmcnt and horror, as if to add to the
terror of the scene that moment rang through the
! walls the cry?44 The prison is on fire ! The pris.
on is on fire !"
At the same instant a broad stream of flame
and smoke flared up from the wooden cupola,
erected on the top of the prison, while the crowd
rushed in from the gate, in Franklin street, filling
the prison yard. Little attention seemed to be
paid to the fire ; the general inquiry was, 44 How
did Colt kill himself ?" In the meantime the engincs
arrived?and the public mind having been
satisfied that Colt had stubbed himself to the heart
with a knife, the horror and terror that had before
prevailed seemed to be c hanged into confusion and
alarm.
, At precisely five minutes before four the door of
Colt's cell was ojH'ried, and I)r. Anthon was about
to enter when he star'ed back with trembling and
outstretched hands. Again he looked in at the
!
door and again started back. The sheriff then
entered the cell and found Colt stretched on his
couch, lying on his Iwck with his mouth and eyes
partly open and a small dagger still planted in his
heart.
The sheriff placed his hand on the face of the
dead man and found it still warm. Several were
admitted to see the body in this state, when the |
coroner took the key and locked the door. At seven
o'clock an inquest was held on the body in the
room of the Court of Sessions, an account of which
will l)e found on our first page.
Probably before five o'clock intelligence of these
events had reached every part of the city. A runior
was very prevalent also, that Samuel Colt had
been arrested on suspicion of setting fire to the prison,
with a view to divert the attention of spccta- J
tors and thus attempt a rescue. Hut Mr. Colt
has not been arrested, nor is he in the least sus
I
pecfed by the magistrates of committing an act ,
so foolish.
The probable or certain cause of the fire was
accident. The watchman in the cupola was or- j
dcred to keep within his room all day, but just before
I o'cloek, he went info the yard to sco the exccution,
when the cupola took fire.
It is a noticeable coincidence, however, that a
friend of ours was earnestly assured, yesterday
morning, by bis housekeeper, that the prison
ivould l>e fired. Wo do not know whether his C
arcJiction was made ou the strength of a dream '
or merely under the influence of one of tho.v <
?<rong, indefinable an<l unaccountable impressions ,
which soft*.-times do so wonderfully precede \
event*. i
At every earner, as we walked home yesterday j

[Thus lias terminated this eventful tragrdy, (
which has few parallels in the history of crime, '
Though the miserable culprit has, on finding all I

A Temperance Procession in Frederick
city, Maryland, which came off on
Tuesday, the 8th inst., is said to have hcen j
one of the largest and most important J
spectacles that has been witnessed in that '
city for many years. From numerous j
sections of the surrounding country came |
different temperance representations, who 1
swelled the concourse to a very targe 1
number. The Citizen says:
4 The sight of this great Temperance
Army, as it moved through the principal
streets of the town, with banners flying
and music playing, afforded a full and
sufficient guaranty to the friends of the
cause, tl at the time is fast approaching
when King Alcohol will be dispossessed
of the Inst remaining portion of territory
to which he can yet lay claim in Frederick
county."
An address was delivered by L. P. W.
Balch, Esq., which is spoken of in high
terms.
A young gentleman at a temperance
meeting, on being asked to sign the
pledge, excused himself by saying, " 1 am
not quite ready," At tho close of the
meeting he proposed to one of the young
ladies present to see her home. " I am
not quite ready," was the laconic reply.
Singular Arrcst.?A couplo of rob- ,
bers were nicely caught, near Louisville
(Ky.)afew days since. It appears that
about two weeks ago the stage between
Lexington and Georgetown, in that State,
was robbed, the trunks of two of tho passengers
having been cut from the boot <
and rifled of their contents, and the rogues, '
as was supposed, had made their escape.
On the evening of the second instant, the
stage from Lexington was stopped a few <
miles from Louisville bv two men who I
took seats for the latter place, but had no *
sooner entered than a passenger seized
one of them by the throat, swearing he
had some of his clothes on, and said he
wasonooftho passengers robbed l>v him. .
The companion of the fellow attempting ,
to aid him, they were both secured by the |
"insides," and upon the arrival of the <
stage in town delivered over to the proper ;
officers. 1

On the Oth instnnt, when the stage of
the Wheeling line stopped at the office in
Bedford, (Pa.) it was discovered that n
mare which hnd been tied to one of the

and it was found necessary to kill her.? ,
On a subsequent examination it was as.
certaincd that the entire foot of the other
fore-leg was off, having separated where
it united with the pastern joint. Search
being inade, the hoof was found at the .
distance of three-quarters of a mile from
where the stage stopped, and the nnimal ?
had come that distance in the painful sit- c
uation she was when her life was taken. 2
The accident is supposed to have occurrod (
at a bridge about two miles west of Bed- '
ford, but that the hoof was nut thrown olT 1
until the animal came tq the place where
it was found.
A singular circumstance took place in /
FishUke township, Maine, last week? t
The facts are given by the Portland <
American as follows:?A married female,
beyond the meridian of life, and whose 1
name is Ann Wrath, had been ill for some ''
time, and on Thursday, the 4th tilt., her
friends and family assembled nround her.
and took their mournful farewell. She
appeared to expire about five o'clock that
afternoon. The ceremonies of laying _
out the dead were duly performed, the
bandages were placed beneath her chin to) j.
tier head, and every preparation was ina.Je j t|
Tor the solemn rites of the burial ground. I h
The sexton tolled his bell; but, nl half post j
eight o'clock, some Minutes before hisj h
work was accomplished, she reared ht*r I
lend in astonishment, and was ainnzed to "
ind that she was able to partake of the rereshinents
for her funeral!
