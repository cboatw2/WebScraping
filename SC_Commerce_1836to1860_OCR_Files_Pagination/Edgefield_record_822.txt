f the 9th inst. contains the followiogextract
m a letter received in that city, dated Fort
ashita, A. T., 7th January.
"The Seminole Chief, Wild Cat, came up
ere on a hunting excursion witli-about 30of
his party. He expressed himself dissatisfied
ith the manner he and his tribe has been trea
ted by the Government He said that they
were promised good land, but that he had not
.yet found that goed land. He looked like a
demon when speaking, of his wrongs, and
boasted of his attrocities and the blood he had
ahed in Florida."
Loss -y Fire.-The Savannah Georgian of
the 12th inst., states, that on the night of the
6th inst., a fire broke out on the estate of Col
James Dunwoody, in McIntosh Co. Georgia,
'which 'destroyed a large three story barn, 50 by
-40 feet, which contained the balance of this,
and a part oflast year's crop of Rice, provisions
for plantation use. &c., the entire eto. k of seed
Rice, with one of Darkens' improved thrashers.
The conflagration was so great, that every ex
ertion to save the Sugar Mill of Mr. James
.Smith, which was in the vicinity of the barn,
proved unavailing, and that establishment,
.consisting of a Mill for grinding Cane, and all
the apparatus for making Sugar were destroy
ed. The loss bythe burning of the mill and
-contents is estimated at $4,000.
Beware of Counterfeits.-In our last we pub.
lished a paragraph from the Charleston Patriot,
relative to counterfeit Ten Dollar notes of the
planters' and Mechanics' Bank of South Caro.
lina, being in circulation in that city. We find
from the Columbia Chronicle or the 13th inst.
that they have also made their appearance in
that vicinity; the editor of the Chronicle, who
examined one of the notes, state, that "It ii
well calculated to deceive the unwary, differing
only from the genuine bill in color. and a cer
tain stiffness in tho signatures. The counter.
feit is much paler, and the heads on each side
of the vignette are rather more indistinct than
those of the genuine. We think it evident that
the counterfeit is a lithograph of the genuine."
Since the above was tn type, we have re.
ceived the Charleston Courier of the 14th inst.
which contains the following paragraph, re a
tive to the circulation of the above notes:
-'From a letter shewn us yesterday, we learn
that an individual, calling himself Stone, de
sired that a bill of this description should be
changed at a-store at Chester Cour t House, on
Saturday last, which was acceded to, and
change given, but the proprietor of the store,
(hiving read the paragraph, and noticing that
the bill answered the description given of the
counterfeit) called Stone back, and inquired if
he had more money of the same description,
which he denied. A search of his person was
demanded, and refused. when Stone made a
vigorous attempt to elude the personal exami
nation. The hue and cry was raised-the
crowd followed and the culprit caught, and on
inspection, it was discovered that air. Stone had
a plentiful supply of ammunition in the shape
ofseveral rolls of counterfeit money, the de
nomination of which is not mentioned in the
letter communicating the information. The
individual was committed for trial."
The N. Y. Journal of Commerce, says: "A
lithographic counterfeit of a five on the Ameri
can Exchange Batik of that city, so exactly
resembles the original that it can with difficul
ty be detected."
Mr. Calhoux.-The Joumnals of both parties
appear to be well pleased writh the appointment
of this able statesman to the office of Secretary
of State. For ourself, we must acknowledge,
we were much astonished at the time we re
eived the news, (although rumor had prece
ded it,) that President Tyler had been so fortu
nate as to make such a aelection; as, in our
humble opinion. Mr. Calhoun is the only per
son, calculated to make the last part ol this ad
ministration oh great and lasting benefit to the
sountry. Should he accelet the appointment,
which we hope he may, he will set all things
strait, and eable the President, by his valuable
advice, to settle the Texas and Oregon qtues
tions, to the satisfaction or the citizens of the
Umnted States, and all others cozncerned.
Annexed we give the opinions of the press
of all parties,(so far as we have received them,)
relative to the appointment:
The South-Carolinian says: "The nom
ination has taken every one by surprise,
yet the press seemns as unanimous itn favor
of it, as the Senate ; and we sincerely hope
Mr. Calhoun may decide to accept it; for
if he does so, desirdus as he is for retire
ment, and without any perceivable per
sonal motive to desire the office, it can only
be with a strong, disinterested, self-sacri
ficing hope of being of service to the coun
try, in the settlement of the great ques
tions at issue. Elevated as is his character
and fame, the office can add nothing to
either, and the remaining portion of the
term is too short to enable him to effect
anything in it of the Government reform so
desirable to himself & his political friends.
The negotiations to be opened with Great
Britain, are beset with too many serious
difficulties, and involve too much of per
sonal responsibility, to reader the manage
meet of them desiralple to any one. This,
however, will not deter Mr. Calhoun from
undertakinj; them, if he believes he can be
of service ; and if he does undertake them,
the very act itself, evidently free from any
sel6sh motive, combined with his great ex
perience and wisdom, and thorough under
etanding of the questions at issue, will at
once give to the country great hope of suc
cess. May the Almighty Disposer of
Events. in whom he h~as ever trusted, and
'who has ever strengthened and sustained
him in doubt or difficulty, guide and direct
him now, both as to the appointment itself,
and its great duties, if he acceptisit."
The Charleston Mercury says: "The
Dews of Mr. Calhoun's appointment is re
ceived every where with lively approba
tion. Political friends and opponents
agree that a better could not be made.
There is a general and deep conviction that
the country at this time calls for pre-emi
jnent ability, firmness, experience and in
teerity, in the direction of the State De
partment. and the universal approva( of
Mr. Calhoun's appointment idi such a cr1
s, is a tribute to his wisdom and charac
ter, much as has been bestowed on few
statesmen. Believing that he can do sub
staptialseryice to the country, we hope he
will acept the appointment. We believe
t, ;,isth ..ne.al ...:s of s. friends. her
that he should do so. We have not heard
an opinion against-it." .
iThe '.Washington Spectator thus an
nouncesthe nomination-: "
.'Mr. Calhoun Secretaryof State.=Mr
Calhoun's name was sentin to-day by the
Presidetitof the United=S8tites foithe Sen.
ate forconfiriation forb the-office of Seere.
.tary of State. Of course' Mr. Calhoun
has not been consulted ipot.the matter
the distance of his abode'rendoring it im
possible for any communication from him
to be received ; but doubtless thef resident,
relying on the positiodninwhich' the coun
try is placed in its foreign relations, infers
that the appointment -will be accepted-by
him.
"Tha there are many and great difficul
ties with-foreign nations, no one can doubt.
1f:Mr. Calhoun believes that his agency is
necessary toladjust them, and' hopes that
they can be adjusted by him, we believe he
will accept the office-for such a time, at
least,, as shall be necessary to test his abil
ity to settle them. But, if on the contrary,
that either they are not of any pressing
emergency, or that his services are not ne
cessary for their right adjuatment, he will
not leave his retirement. The position
itself at this time of life, with the distin-'
guished stations he' has already occupied,
can give no honor; and nothing but a stern
sense gf public duty will induce him to
assume it The Oregon question we can
not believe to be capable of any settlement
by treaty ; and, therefore, neither honor nor
usefulness will probably accompany any
efforts for this purpose. The feeling of the
West, as developed in Congress, will have
the whole of that Territory or none., and
of-course there is no room for treaty, which
always implies conflicting rights. To sat-'
isfy those chiefly interested-the West
we do not deem possible, unless Great
Britain will surrender all her pretensions ;
of course, therefore, any treaty 'concluded
concerning Oregon, will, with the West,
damn any statesman who makes it. We
think our title pretty clear, thatn accord
ing to European notions of the right of
civilized nations to take possession of more
barbarous nations and. appropriate them,
men and territory, to their special benefit.
Admitting that because a nation is civil
ized and christianized, it has a right to
send a ship or a dozen men, and claim an
empire inhabited by weaker and more bar
barous nations, not only against these na
tions, but also against all other civilized
nations-why, we have a capital title.
"We shall be very glad if Mr. Calhoun,
or any body else, can adjust this question
to our entire satisfaction,. But we are a
land-bitten people, and we fear we love
excitement, perhaps war, more than-peace.
"We had written thus far, when we
were informed that Mr. Calhoun's nomi
nation, without the usual reference to a
committee, was confirmed instzintaneously
and unanimously by the Senate on pre
sentation. If one man in this Union is ad
equate to save the country from any evil,
we believe it to be this old, wise, long-tried
statesman. The country, we are satisfied,
will rejoice, should ho accept the appoint
ment."
The National Intelligencer, in announ
cing it, says:
"This is an appointment upon which we
can conscientiously congratulate the coun
try. However, we may have differed
from this distinguished citizen on important
questions of domestic policy, we are happy
in the belief that, in the station to which
he has been called, under circumstances
well calculated to flatter an honest pride
in him, he will do honor to himself and to
his country."
The Globe remarks upon the unusual
importance of the office at this time, and
a dds:
"Mr. Calhoun, if he accepts the office,
will have it in his power to do much good
for the country, and for his own fame. He
has not sought the office, directly or indi
rectly- No friend of his, we understand,
has approached the President on the sub
ject. No one of them. we believe, can an
swer as to the probability of his acceptirng
it. For the most part, they are in favor
of his taking the office."
The Richmond Enuquirer, announcing
the appointment, says:
"We cannot 'entertain a moment's doubt
that he has been selected with special re
gard to the question of Oregon and the an
nexation of Texas-and no man is better
calculated to conduct these two great.
questions, thtan John C. Calhoun. We
hope. he will not hesit ate one mpment to
devote his eminent ability to the publiq
service-and that he will accept the ap
pointment, so honorably tendered, so hon
orably conferred."
The New York Journal of Commerce
says of it :
"The appointment of John C. Calhoun
to the office of Secretary of State, is an
event of nto common interest to the nation.
His great talents will be found adequate to.
any emergency, and his long experience
in public affairs nsill enable him to guide
the ship of State safe'ly and prosperously."
The New York Republic thus announ
ces it :
"No event has taken place in political
life for some years past, has relieved us
from a greater weight of anxiety and in
cerpitudo than the appointment of Mr. C.
We place the fullest confidence in his sin
gleness of purpose and firmness of charac
ter-he is too high-minded and patriotic to
sacrifice in anything the honor and inter
ests of his country-he is too philanthropic
and hum'sno to allow the mere suggestiotts
of vanity or the ties oflparty to plunge the
country into the horrors and embarrassment
of war.
"His great wisdom and experience in
political affnirs will not only be found use
ful on this, but on many other questions
which nearly effect our domestic interests.
WVe congratulate the country on the pru
dence of the choice it has made, and the
country on the evils it is saved from."
The New York Herald of the 5th, be
fore the nomination was known, says;
"We believe Mr. Webster might be able
to settle peaceably the Oregon gue~tion,
so as to satisfy the east; but whether he
could settle it or the Texas question on
terms to satisfy the south and west, we
are disposed to doubt. In this aspect of
te case, it is probable that Mr. Calhoun
woa~ dgive more satisfaction to the con
try in'tlation to these questions than any
other mDet that could be namned. And,
looking ahnwck . selection in 'every point
of view, we are disposed to think that Pre
sidont Tyler would find it very much to
:ti advantage of his administration, and i
his ulterior views also. The friends o
'Mr. Cithoum in the South aidwest are no
merous: These friends.would be attache
to.the administration and its nioveinents
in case of theselection offtheir Coryphti
for tbe'department of State; aDd Mr. Cal
haunimight in that position, from his'grea
talents-from his moderation-from hit
profound intellect-be enabled 'to setit
these questions to the satisfaction of tht
great mass of the Southern- and Westert
States, and certainly not so much in hos
tllify to the east. If they could be settlet
with peace, that is all the east wants-tha
is all that the interests of commerce re
quire-and that is all that could be gainer
even by the selection of Mr. Webster."
The New Yaor American notices thu
the appointment of Mr. Calhoun -
The New, .Nomination.-.John C. Cal
'noun has received a unanimous confirma
tion as Secretary of State. This circun
stance, taken in connection with Mr. Cal
boon's position as a candidate thrust asid
by a more adroit and far less able compet
itor for the Presidency--and with the con
v.iction that all must feel, that if he accep
the post, it must be from a sense of public
duty, and not for the gratification of pri
vate ambition-will enable him to exer
cise a degree of power and indepeudenc
in that post, that may redound equally ti
his own lasting honor, and to the benefit o
his country.
Mr. Calhoun offers his security to tih
country-placed as we think it is in immi
nent danger of war by the rash and ill
-red movements on the Oregon ques
at he knows the value of Peace
is all the folly and wickedness. ii
the present state of the world, of provo
king a war for a region we do not at ires
ent want, and which, in the nature c
things, and by the operation of irresistibl
causes, must, before we are, in truth, read
to occupy it, fall within our orbit.
Oregon, American in title, will also b
American in possession by the mere cours
of events-and Mr. Calhoun is too Iris
and two conscientious a man to grasp a
that with a violent and bloody hand, whicl
will come to us in due time, of its own fret
will.
We repeat, therefore, thehope that Mr
Calhoun may accept."

The failure ofAMr. Malgeo yesterday, has
:aused a great sensation here. One bank,
t is said, has cashed drafts of his accept.
ance to the tune of $200,000, taking cot
ton that they were drawn against as
collateral, none of which has come to hand.
rho Manhattan Bank yesterday certified
$10,000 of his paper, whish at the close
if iihe bank hours proved worthless, and
they are raising a question whether they
aire liable for the same. The general opin.
on is that they are. I have heard thai
Magee is among the missing.
Great Bank Robbiery.-Tbhe Madisor

"The money stolen was: all on ope

There were in one part of the turpentine
manufactory, '3000 barrels of resin, 400.
barrels of tar, and a-large number of empty
casks. These were all on fire at the same

f The Picayune gives the following- de
scription of'what is regarded as rather "a
lively place," well to do in the Southwest.
"They have a little town "Out West"
which appears to have been overlooked by
Dickens and other English writers of his
class, and which is "all sorts" of a stirring
placo. In one day they recently had two
street fights, hung a man, rode three out of
town on a rail, got up a quarter race, a
turkey shooting, a gander pulling, a match
dog fight, had preaching by a Methodist
circuit rider who afterwards inn a foot race
fur drinks "all round ;" and as if this was
not enough, the judge of the court after
losing a year's salary at single handed
poker, and whipping a person who said he
didn't understand the game, went out and
helped Lynch a man for hog stealing."
