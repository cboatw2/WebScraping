Tornado passed over Woodstock at 12 o'clock on ^

We also learn that considerable damage from i
the same visitation has been done to Mr. Paul C. 1

Island the gale was considered far more destructive
than either of the former.

the 29th ult. Mr. Richard Wade, jr. was '
engaged in digging a well on his premises,
I, about four miles south of Findlay; after *
having dug down something like 18 feet,
the appearance of water- was evident, m
Mr. Wade being anxious to obtain water,' t
seized a crowbar, which was standing j
near, and made several strokes near the
centre of the well, whereupon the water i
gushed forth in vivid torrents. Had not <
Mr. Wade been extremely active in at- 1
tempting to escape, he would have perish I
ed almost instantly. At the time of the I
water gushing forth, a continued roaring i
ensued similar to a loud clap of thunder, .
which shook the earth violently for several
hours. By an application of a lire i
brand to the water, it took fire and burnt i
like Alcohol; the blaze struck live foot I
above the surface of the well, and at the
same time burning the Puncheons that lay
on the top of the well. The water still
continues to boil.

Memoranda.?The Danish brig, Mark,
Cupt. Chase, from St. Croix for Philadelphia,
in lat. 23, long. 63, on the 9th July,
was hoarded about sunset by nine men in
a boat, each having on a short duck frock,
from a vessel about $ miles to leeward?
which they reported to be a Spanish brig
from Sierra Leone, hound for N. O., 60
days out, with 160 passengers! The
weather was nearly calm, and the vessel
was first -seen early in the afternoon.?
The boat had several small kegs, which
they said they brought to get .water.?
There appeared to be but little subordination
among them; and as soon as they
came alongside of the Mack, the whole of
them came immediately on the quarterdeck
and, and asked for some water.?
The captain gave them a barrel of water,
which was all he could spare. They
then requested him to alter his course and ,
bear down for the brig?as their boat was j
leaky, and could not carry* the water.?
the captain asked them why so man}
came in her if she was leaky, as four were
enough to row her. To this they r^ade
no reply. They remained on board till
quite dusk, when the captain peremptorily
ordered them to leave his vessel, which
hey showed no disposition to do, repeating
that their bout was leaky a?d unsafe
?and telling the captain, 4,don*t be afraid/
But as the brig had a strong crew, equal
in number to them, and a large dog, and
a passenger (from New York, who let
them see the ends of two horse pistols
under his coat, they at length, when it
was quite dark, left the brig. The next
morning nothing was seen of them. The
circumstances render i? very likely that
it was the same vessel which hoarded the
