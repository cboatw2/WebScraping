The Hon.'Jonathan Roberts has been dismissed (
? from the office'of Collector of the port of Phihdel. !
phia, by the President, and has published a state.
? meat of the manner of his appointment and dis.
j missal of wijich the following is the substance/
. { In the spring of 1641 he addressed a letter to j
* Fhwiflcnt Tylcr rccommending another person for
the -office then vacant. The President's reply, j
wbieh is. embraced in the ^statement, informs hitn
c: that the of?ce had "been conferred upon himself, !
1 i? in otfc*:r tCrpc^l "higMv eor-p^ifntarv.
i According to law it is the duty of the Collector tc
J recommend to the .Secretary of the Treasury per.
sons for the subordinate situations in the Custom
House, and if the Secretary approves them the ap.
poiutrnents are thereby confirmed. Mr. Roberts
accordingly sent on a list to the Secretary, which
was approved. As a matter of course, in such a
case, disappointed applicants who considered
themselves entitled to a share of the spoils for
which they had fought so long and so hard, for.
warded their complaints to Washington. These
complaints had so much influence on the President
as to induce him to address a letter to the Collector
asking for information. After receiving the
Collector's reply, the President returned the following
answer:
" Washington, May 10,1841.
" Mr Dear Sir : I take a moment to say to
you that my confidence is wholly unabated, and
that I have no dmbt but that all that you have
done will be wi 11. My last letter was de.
signed to place me in possession of facts which 1
might use advantageously. I shall give car to
nothing to your injury. With truest regard,
yours, &.c.
JOHN TYLER.
" Hon. Jona. RoacRTg."
Mr. Roberts asserts that he abstained carefully
from any expression of opinion on national polities,
and was therefore surprised to see it repeated,
ly stated in the columns of paper* supposed to peg.
scss the confidence of the President, that changes
of officers would soon be made in the custom house
of Philadelphia. He therefore addressed a letter
to the President, dated April 28th 18-12, referring
to. these statements and requesting an opportunity
to give an account of his stewardship, stating at
the Bame time that he would soan visit Wash in*,
ton for that purpose. To this letter no answer w_s
returned. Before the President received it he had
written a note to the Secretary of the Treasury,
which was forwarded to .Mr. Roberts as follows:
" Washington, Arm. 27, 1842.
" Sir: I have to rcqurst that the following
changes be rnide in the Custom House at Phil idclphia,
to take effect on the first day of May.
It is required for reasons satisfactory to myself, and
connected with the administration of the Governmental
affair;-."
Ilcrc followed a list of 31 names of persons to
be appointed in place of others to he removed.
. To this letter Mr. Roberts made the following
reply.:
" rtnr itctm's Office. Philadelphia. )
. Ap.il 3J, 1842. {
"Sir: I have this moment received yours of the
27th inst. enclosing one of the same date from the
President, addressed to you, suggesting changes to
f>e made at the custom house at Philadelphia, to
commence on the 1st proximo. The existing appointments
were made in conformity with the
suggestions I had received from the President in
communicating to me my appointment. They
were confirmed by the Secretary of the Treasury
in due form, with the President's approbation, as
I am bound to presume. Many of the men
whose names arc given in the President's letter
are wholly unknown to me; others I know to be
unfit and unworthy of my confidence, and lh:nk,
knowing what 1 do, both the President and your,
self would concur with inc. I feel that having
^iven heavy and substantial security for the dis- |
;h irgc of the duties and accountabilities of this
jffice, I have al.-o to attest my satisfaction with
he gentlemen designated to be removed. I have
io partiality for any of them that would induce
tic to hesitate a moment to comply with the wish.
?s of the Psesidcnt in their removal, if any creditable
evcidence was given that they had spoken
lightly of him.
I wrote to the President through you on the
28th, bespeaking a conference with him in the
ensuing week; it is still my purpose to be in
Washington early in the week, and until then, I
pray you to communicate to hirn that I wish to
confer with him before any measures be taken by
rnc to cxecntc his wishes.

Respectfully yours,
J. ROBERTS."
" Hon. Walter Forward.
To this the President replied through his son
and Private Secretary as follows:
" Dear Sir : The President has received your
letter on the subject of removals contemplated in
the custom-house at Philadc'phia.
|
He begs me to say to you that he entertains the
highest consideration for yourself, but that he
thinks the public service requires that those remova's
should take place.
Jle therefore has ordered mc to say to you Ipat
he desires the requisition he has made on you in
this matter to be at once, and to the letter, com.
plied with.

Trns reply Mr. Roberts did not receive till after
he had visited Washington and had the interview
with the President described by Mr. Roberts himself
in the extract from his statement which we
make below. lie reached Washington on the 3d
May, the same day on which the above letter was
despatched, as appears from the.post mark, and"
palled on the Secret try of tho Treasury. Tuat
officer said he lud no agency whatever in making
out the list of either the removals or appointments
ordered by the President. He expressed thp opinion
that the President would be satisfied if Mr.
n ' 1 1 inm l>o Asitp!i/>n?
iv??xns wouia inauc uuu?<j uuu v??w .^jvwv.v^..
to the changes proposed. Tne fo'lowing is Mr.
R.'s account of li.s interview with the President:
" On the 4th I attended the President's antechamber
for several hou 8, and finally wiisobiigod
to retire w.thout having an interview. I made a
renewed effort to see tiie President in the after,
noon, but the servant even refused to carry my
card to his master, saying that he tlarcd not do
it.
On applying for admission on the morning of
the 5th, the porter at the door, who knew me,
said I could not see the P.esi lent, as he was engaged
with the Secretary of State; I suid I would
wait till the Secretary had gone. He then asked
me if 1 had not received a letter ? I answered in
the negative. He then said one had been forwarded
to me. I urgod an admission, saying that my
business was to see the President. The servant
jflvancpri tr, tHo f/vit nf thi-otr,ir* and seemed
to announce me to some one above. I went up
stairs, found no one there, and the door cloeed;
after knocking and receiving no answer, I seated
myself on the only chair in the passage and remain
ed there for more than an hours, several persons
I did tic-* kr.cw tr. the nv?:*r. time pv:,?.:nr in
, ! and out of the President's room. X went into th<
. ! ante-chaipber opposite and directed the servant U
; J say to the President that *1 wafthcre and wooh
wait hit pleasure. After remaining some tim<
, longer till the hour for receiving visiters had expi
red, I was admitted to the President, whom 1
1 found iu conversation with an individual whom 1
learned to be one of the suffrage agents frorr
Rhode Island. On his retiring, I remarked to th<
President that my object was, tid thy tetters bad
1 intimated, to have a personal coftfrrsace with
: him in relation to his recent requisition on me.?
| He said he must decline any conference; he wish'
: cd his request complied with: it was liot an order,
i " I was surprised," said be," that you demurred."
, In a very guarded and respectful manner' I' replied
that I could not conscientiously do what ha
desired. The President then said with great
vehemence, " Then, sir, you know, as a man 6i
honor, what you ought to do." I answered firmly
and respectfully, '* Mr. President, I cannot
withdraw from my duty." 1 then handed to him
and requested bitn to read a very scurriloua, abusive,
and profane letter, [too improper in ita language
to be inserted here,] signed 44 John Gtiffm,
No. 2, Strawberry street," one of the persons
whom I was directed to appoint, asking him if he
thought a person who would write such a letter
was worthy of hie confidence ? He read it, or ap.
peared to read it, and returned it without a te.
mark ; he then asked mc abruptly how many men
there were belonging to the Philadelphia Custom*
house ? My reply was," including laborers, about
one. hundred." " Howjnoany of them," said h?,
44 arc Clay men 7" I answered that none to my
knowledge had avowed themte'lves such, for that
all had followed bis inqtruet.ons in enjoining* si':
lenee on political topics. Conceiving it" time to
withdraw, I rose and took his hand [he remaining
seated] anu remarked that this wai probably the
last time wc should meet; that I should ever be
mindful of the kindness he had manifested in *p;
pointing me to office, and that I should'never efii
tsrtain vindictive feeling*.towards him. He made
no reply, not even the acknowledgment which
ordinary courtesy to one so much bis senior would
dictate, and I retired."
When Mr. Robert* returned to Philadelphia, be
found on his desk the letter from the President's
Private Secretary, quoted above, but, without
complying \v;th its requisition, proceeded in the
regular discharge of his official duties. On the
10th of September the Secretary of the Treasury
addressed him a letter informing him that the Pres.
ident had appointed Thomas S. Smith Coilectdr
of the Customs for the district of Philadelphia
in his place.
The removal took place ten days after the ad.
journment of Congress, and no one who reads the
above statement can doubt that it had been deter,
mined upon months before it took place, and whilst
the Senate was in session. Why was not the
change made before the adjournment of Congress?*
Without further light on the subject, it would
Reem to have been from an apprehension that the
Senate might not confirm the new nomination.
If this was really the motive for the delay, it was
I a most gross abuse of the power to fill vacancies
! during the recess. "J '' * ?

e* Although any; one is to be commiserated who is
: insensible to the power of music, yet how few
bersons arc cntirelr aware of the full extent of its
influence over their feeling! Nature rarely makes
so great a mistake at to constitute an intellectual
bemg who can listen unmoved to tfee " concord of
sweet soundV' yet do we sometimes see that rara
avis, a black swan in our own spcclcs, one who
I bas .no music in his soul. Let us hope, however,
that there arc not many of that order, condemned
to a; spirit out of karmony with their lot. It may
be, perhaps, that those who are excluded from
pleasure in one respect, hare a more exquisite en.
joyment in another; yet whatever it may be it is
Undoubtedly a poor recompense: nothing seems
to realize more vividly the anticipations of another
* and a brighter world, than those sweet and melo!
dious strains which seem to touch that chord in
oUr natures responsive to its tones. Listen to the
rich-full harmony of the choir organ, or the soft
s^ect breathings of a .woman's voice !' What
^flsorc than lh? fornix, tranqu liies the mind and
? prepares it to receive the,solemn truths of ihsplra.
?t^>n? whilst the latter spreads a voluptuous en,
| thusiasm over the siul, which seems intimately to
J hnk-itwith the intellectual par} afour oaf lire ! We
j always sec that the more civilized and refined a na.'
1 lion in, in just the same ratio do they cultivate the
' 'divine science; consequently it is the superior na.
Itu'rihi that appreeiats and comprehend music best.

port ourselves from every, earthly disappointment!
in Rours of ill health* in the,darkpe*3 of desponden.
cy; in the fever of pftty cares and anxieties far the' I
fbture, how impressively is it thus that we learn
I to feel ourselves not alone! Music comes to us

Columbia.?From all indication* we think Co.
lurabia is about to commence a new era in her
history. -Our Rail Road will become the great
channel of commerce between tho upper and lower
country. An immense quantity of merchandize
has already been forwarded by this conveyance
to Columbia, destined for the upper part of. this
State and North Carolina. This must enlarge
our dealings with the North Carolinians, for the
. wagons destined to haul these goods away will
bring produce down with them,- which will be
bartered off for merchandise. Our .merchants
generally hare laid in large supplies of goods arj
at a cheap rate, and they can, consequently, af.
ford to sell them cheap. It has been supposed,
by some individuals, that the Rail Road would in.
jure the mercantile business of-Columbia, as plant. ,
era would be induced to carry their crops to Char,
'leston, and after disposing of it lay ,in their
supplies in that city. We beg leave to .differ with
tficra. Some of our planters may try it as an ex.

groceries or dry goods can be purchased in Char,

presented to* the Fublic from which thej may

Tbcfirst ground of complaint against them was,

long session of Congress, haa been as follows : I

In 1631, on the 27th of June,
In 1826, on the 9th of May,
Li 163on the 6th of April,
In 1843, on tha 8th of May.
The average time, then, taken to pass these
bills, for the last ten years, was to the 17th of May.
At this session the General Appropriation Bill pass,
ed the House on the 20th of April; that is, twen.
ty-scYea days earlier than the average time for the
last ten years, although, owing to the duty of in.
(jailing into and correcting errors and abuses
which hare grown up during the last twelve ye&ra
in the administration of the finances, much more
time than usual waa necessarily consumed in ex.
amining and debating the dctaila of this and other
appropriation bills.
In relation to the general charge that this Congress
has done but little business in comparison
-with the length of its session, the following facts
will enable the public to judge how much truth
there is in the accusation: '
The present session of Congress is the longest
ever held under - the Government, extending
through a period of 269 days. The session of Con.
gress next to the present in duration was the sec.
ond long session under Mr. Van Buren, which
lasted 229 days.
,If .the business done bjr the House at these two
sessions be contrasted, it will stand thus:
Reports made. Bills reported. Bills passed.

At the preeent session there were?
Reports made. Bills reported. Bills passed.
, 1,098 610 299
- In addition to the bills passed, it may also be
stated that there are about one hundred private
bills of the House which have been engrossed,
and are now ready for their final passage, and
most of which would have passed if the Senate
could have acted upon them, and which were purposely
retained in the House because these bill?
will be in a better position at the next session for
early action than if they had passed the House,
and been laid aside in the Senate ror want o'.
time to act on them. In addition to these, numerous
joint resolutions have also been passed ;
and the general result of a 'comparison is, that
this Congress has made more reports, passed more
public laws, and done more important business
than any Congress which ever convened since the
formation of the Government.?Nat. Intcll.
Tools for Boys.?Boys should hare a*
good tools as men. and they should be &

say ifa rake should be put into his hands,
four times the usual size ? He would at
once complain that it was too large and
heavy, and say that he could not work

DIED.
Departed this life, at the summer residence of i
her father near Cheraw, on the night of the 26th
September, -Mrs. Henrietta J., wife of Col. Jas.
W. Blikeney, and daughter of Mr. Isaiah Du
Bose.
The deceased professed to receive converting
grace in the spring of 1838, being then in her 15th
year. Since that time she has been a consistent
member of the Methodist E. Church, faithful in
tire discharge of her christian duties both public
and private, and seeking in all things to glorify
God. Her last illness of seven weeks she bore
with christian patience and resignation. When
informed that her case was doubtful, and that it
might terminate fatally, she received the intelli. J
gence with calmness, and said, "I ?m not afraid !
to die.' I do not possess such strong confidence as '
I could desire, but I have no fear." The writer
of this article visited her about a week before her
death, and found her calm and composed, and
manifesting strong confidence in the Lord. The
day before she died I visited her again. When!
went in she could scarcely speak, but testified that
Jesus was precioys. And when she bad lost the
power of speech, aniious to recent- her dying tcs- '
timnnv I desired her if she saw her wav clear for -1
~..J, J
heaven to preas my hand; she did so, and iramedi.
atelyjoy was depicted in her countenance. In ,
this frame she continued until about 10 o'clock tit
night, when she sweetly fell asleep in Ji am. I
" When, as a signal of her leave to go,
Home to her Saviour, free from sin and woe,
Death from his quiver showed a fatal dart,
A sudden pulse of joy leaped from her heart.
Enough of life, and all its charms, ahe cried,
Welcome, my father's messenger, and died." '
A devoted husband, affectionate parents, brothers
and sister*, and many friends ate left to mourn
her loss. But in their deep'distress they have
strong consolation in the thought that she met
death as a conquered foe, and now doubtless lives
in heaven.
