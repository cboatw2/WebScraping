The committee of the whole, on the
'amendment to' the constitution, t<
suppress duelling, set agan to-day. Mr.
v Davie having the Hoor, replied at length
i;td' Mr. M^raaiingpr. Mr. Sims advocated
the amendment?tMV. Perry opposed
it?-in a speech of much eloquence, ana
with great effect. fie placed his opposi
tion to it, entirely on the ground, that
a#y legislation on this subject would he
nugatory, so long as gentlemen would
continue, to place a higher estimate upon
, chnracUr, than upon dollars and cents;
aiid "fee* aksed, if a challenged party were
' to refuse to give the usual satisfaction,
on the ground, that he might lose an office,
if he would not disgrace and degrade
himself, in the eyes of the community?
that the case would be very different,
should he take the high ground of morai
1 scruples, but that he would bjcoine insig
niticant and contemptible, by attempting
to evade personal responsibility, from ar
over nice regard, for the condition of his
pockets; On the question of agreeing tc
the bill, it was negatived by a considerable
majority. Elections were held t<
day, for Governor and Lieutenant Gov.
...crnor, which resulted 111 the election ol
Mr. Richardson to the former office, ano
Mr. Clowney to the latter. O.i tlie firs!
: ballot for Governor, the vote stood thus?
Richardson 104, Hammond 47, Hmegar
6, Johnson 5. At the time of the electioD,
I believe it was generally understood
that Judge Johnson was not a candidate,
bui some of his friends were determined.to
vote for him, whether he was a
v, candidate or not.
- Having nothing more of the proceedings
of this day to communicate, I will
resunie the brief sketches of charactei
which I have been attempting, and will
?r Introduce to your particular notice, oui
excellent Sjieaker, 1). L. Wardlaw, whose
claims to public distinction, must not be
measured by the order in which he is here
introduced ; for though he may be among
the last in this respect, he is among the
forcrttost in every other. The duties ol
Speaker, are arduous and embarrassing
in the highest degree. One hundred anil
.{twenty .four members in one hall, of even
variety of character, arc to l>e eontrollei
and regulated by one man. This, he ha?
to do, without doing injustice to either o
"4hem, and in such manner as not to forfei
their respect-and esteem. Yet for five
years, he has held this post, without giv
. ing the slightest dissatisfaction, and in
- . defid his popularity seems only to iucrca,n
with his continuation in the office. Hi
?? tltorniiirhlv versed in the rules of the
* 0~v _ House,
and applies them with a readiness
And just discrimination, which is almos
- astonishing. -A question of order has
- scarcely arisen, before a just decisior
' settles it?so satisfactory indeed, thai ]
" -'have never known one appealed from.?
*' V As an instance of his readiness, and hi:
* correct application of the rules, so as t<
preserve the dignity of the House1, at th(
same time that he administers a salutarj
corrective, to any member disposed t<
. invado jt, I will mention an anecdote, pe
culiarly illustrative of his talent in thi:
respect. - A member, {with a view per
haps to Jereate a laugh,) inquired of th<
Speaker, whilst the House wae ie session
t
"Mr. Speaker, what has become of my
bill ?"?alluding to some bill which he
, had introduced; to which, the Speaker
promptly replied, "The Speaker knows of
no bill, bearing the title of my bill." In
! his manners, he is verv affable and con'
ciliating; his voice approaches to the
t feminine, but it is nevertheless clear and
distinct?in stature, he is about the middle
size, his face is expressive of great
^benevolence, and is also a very correct
index to the intellectual strength, which
has placed him in the foremost rank,
among the statesmen and lawyers of the
State.

1 Atone o'clock to-dav, the Governor
1 elect attended in the Representative Hall,
to take the oath of office, and deliver his
j inaugural address. The House was
crowded to overflowing?the galleries
j filled with ladies?the aisle, with venera.
r ble senators, and the lobby with spectators
of every description. His Excellency,
. ascended the Speaker's desk, and ip a
speech df considerable lcnglh, expressed
his views, in reference to the course he
s intended to pursue. On all political
? questions of the day, he was pcfectlv orthodox,
according to the opinions of a'ina.
; jority of our politicians, and spoke of the
party in the minority, with that respect,
" which gentlemen of intelligence and re}
finemcnt generally use, when speaking of
-, each other. In adverting to old party differr
I ences, he spoke witfr much feeling and
? eloquence?alluded to the harmony now
prevailing, as a cause of congratulation
to every citizen of the State, and pledged
himself to the faithful and diligent dis!
charge of the various duties which appcr[
tained to his office. The address, has
1 given very general satisfaction. It was
i delivered with a clear voice, and an im.
pressive manr.cr, and on the whole, was
I well worthy of the high character, which
1 his excellency has ever sustained. As
the inaugural, will soon appear in the pub.
lie prints I forbear to make any further
remarks upon it, and will commend your
readers to the inspection of the address
itself, for farther information on that sub,
ject.
! A bill to alter the fees of Sheriffs,
J Magistrates and Constables, has caused
! a good deal cf squib-firing to-day. It
appears, that some members have been
sent here, charged, in part, with express
- instructions to reduce the fees of those
> officers?thus an interest hds been excited
on the subject, which attracted the attcn1
| tion of members, to the details of the bill;
1 and as a natural consequence, motions to
j amend to strike out, and insert &c. were
j showered upqji us, with a liberality which
| was any thing but desirable. Upon all
I such motions, a debate follows, as a matter
of course, and debates consumed time.
| Much time was therefore consumed, for
11 fear that the dear "people might lose a
{ four.pence. Pierced with many stabs, it
floundered, limped and staggered through
. a second reading, when we sent it to the
> Senate for its concurrence. I doubt if
? we ever see it again. There will not be
time enough to discuss it.
> Dec. 11.
I The bill to raise supplies, was taken
up for consideration, it having been made
,r j tne special order for 1 o'clock. The
i clause, increasing the tax on lands to
forty five cents, appeared to be very
> unpopular, and was assailed from various
quarters of the House. The members in
> the opposition, contended, that it was un
equal, and unjust to the planters, as the
r bill did not proj>ose to increase the taxes
I upon any other property?lands and
t negroes would, therefore, have to bear the
whole burden of the increased taxation,
> whilst professions, stock in trade, &c.
which were more productive, would j>ay
> their tax as heretofore?that much of the
land of the State was unproductive, and
whilst others pay only for productive
i property, the planter was already obliged
to pay for capital, which did not produce
him a dollar. On the other side it was
I alledgcd, that the tax on lands was alto*
' gether disproportionate, as it was much
I less than that upon stock in trade, town
' lots, and professional income, and that
' strict justice required that the increased
i rates should be placed upon lands only;
; but as justice should be seasoned by
[ mercy, the bill contemplated a division of
1 the burden, by placing a part of it on nef
groes. Many of the parties debating nd;
mitted, that the taxes should be raised,
I and the main question was, whether the
' mode proposed was a proper one, or
I should the tax be raised on every deserips
tiou of property. As the legislature,
f would not tax the people so as to do injust
ticc to any portion of them, the main
i inquiry seemed to he, whether the mode
- proposed, was just. Upon this point, we
- had thirteen speeches to-day, so that there
is a great probability, that we are all
?? I I * i 1 it. ?
3 iuiiv cnnrgea wim me necessary imuri
mation, for qualifying us to vote under>
standingly, when the question comes up.
t To the writer's ?mind, the necessity for
4 any increase at all, has not yet been
i made apparent. The legislature, would
I show more judgment, by curtailing erpen.
- diturcsy than by throwing more fuel into
s the fire, by which our funds may have
> been consumed. We have put too much
? steam on the vessel of State, and until
; we make up our minds to lower it, it is
) useless to talk about the emptiness of the
- treasury. It is our own fault, and we
s have yet to acquire wisdom enough to stop
- the hole in the barrel, before we insist
s upon our constituents injuring themselves
, ft? fill it. 'Tfeifi would be the-course,
t ./ ? .t ?. ? . -. i
which prudence would dictate in the man- j hi
agcmcnt of our own affairs, and -how i M
could we act consistently if we pursue a ;
different course, for those who have con-1z<
tided their interests to our -care. 'If an'8?
individual acting for himself, were to dis-. 8;
cover, that his expenditures exceeded his
income, his ohvious course would be, to w
l?*>k narrowly into his affairs, and dpply jjj
himself assiduously to an immediate retrcnchment.
This course, is the proper* w
one for the legislature now to pursue, and af
should the members in their wisdom see n<
proper to adopt it, we will be spared the
disagreeable necessity of levying addi- tc
tional contributions, upon the hard earn- pi
ings of the people. Much time having 1?
been consumed in the debate, it was adjourned
over, and made the sj?ecial order 1
for to-morrow, at 1 o'clock. The subject
has attracted the closest attention of the
members, and no correct calculation can $]
now be made, when the discussion will q,
end. " jg
December l'2th, ' "ij
A resolution, to reduce the salary of the ^
superintendent of Public works, was called
up for consideration, and debated. It
was strenuously opposed by several pen.
tlemen, who attempted to demonstra/c ! p
the absolute necessity of securing coinpe- j'?
tent officers in the service of the State
that this could not be effected, by redu- j
cing salaries, which, in reality, were not tj
too high?thar. out of the salary of this g
office, the incumbent had to pay his trav. t?
idling expenses, which were considerable, o
and that he was compelled to be almost con - r
stantlv frorfl home. On the contrary side of
the question, it wus alledged,tiint the duties
of the office, were not proportioned to the
high salary which was paid for their per. .
formanci?that he was only required to c
make occasional visits to the different pub. ^
lie works in the state, and that, in a fmnn.
cial point of view, it was lighly proper, that <r
we should now look to the bill of expenses K
the debateWent off, an a motion to. refer the t'
resolution to the committee on interim] ?s
improvements, which it is understood will c
be the last of it, for the present session, as
that committe will not report in time for n
the action of House. In my own opin. n
ion, it would be better to abolish theo^Tre, h
as that would strike at the very root ufi c
he evil. If internal improvements had
proved themselves of essential advantage
to the country, then the only question is,
as to the best mode of carrying out the )
. ?. 4|
system?to do tms, we must nave uic scr- i
vices of scientifick, honourable gentlemen j *
and these must he well paid, Rut the or- j
ror is, in adopting the system at all; lor c
if we will learn from experience, we have j *
been taught an abundance of lessons upon ?
j this subject. It will not be hazarding too ''
| much to say, that the State has been the.
' sufferrerfin every attempt heretofore made r
in the wnv of public works, with the ex? c
caption perhaps, of the College, and the.I.J,
Lunatick Assy him. Millions of our mon-j *
ey,have been lavished upon attempts, to !*;
outdo nature herself in brilliant achieve- I.-'
ments for the public good, and we have I P
no doubt astonished our sister states, by ?
j our heroic efforts in this behalf. We need ' *
not inquire, what has been the results?let .1 ?
our rivers, canals, creeks and rail-roads, I ?
speak for themselves; and it is to be feared,, J
ihat we will hear a tale, at which statepride
may blush, which ought not to ex-1
cite, a different sensation. Shall we pur- ?
sue this experiment father, or shnll we. in
these tiincsof pecuniary distress, profit by
experience, and banish the whole system,
from our state? Private cnterprize, innv 0

when the genera! interest is confided to j ?
individuals, they are too apt to forget the j
former, in the greater solicitude which j ~
they feel for the latter. Thus it is!
| that the state is too often overlooked, j
and her interests are sunk very frequent, i ?
ly in the one-eyed fidelity of her public j *
functionaries. A perpetual drain, has j ^
thus been kept upon the treasury, and we ! s
have nothing left us but einptv regrets, at ^
the complete disappointment of all our ex- V
pcctations. -JThe
uufinished debate of yesterday was ^
resumed, at the appointed hour, when
Mr. Burt moved that forty five cento on land
be stricken out, for the purpose of ,
of preserving the former rates of taxation. S
He demonstrated very clearly, that thdre
was no necessity for increasing tliem.?-^- '
Nothing more need be said in this place' '
; about the debate, but that we had six more 1
speeches, and on the question being been f
I put to the House, the vote was 70 in fnv- s
| our of the motion, and 49 against it?so t,
I that the taxes on lands and negroes, were j,
; not raised. I propose to close this com- c
j municaticn, with a brief sketch of Mr. | ^
I Burt, whose name has just been meution- j ?j
! ed. He is one of the members from Ah- j ^
i beville, and inadc his first speech to-day, a
i since the session commenced. This may j(
seem a little remarkable, as he is a gentle- s
] man of acknowledged abilities, and of very j,
high standing at the bar. But, he does '
! not appear desirous to be heard on every r
i subject, which would admit of a speech? |"
on the contrary he exhibit no disposition
whatever to win the popular applause, by
seizing hold of occasions to make himself r
heard, or in his private walks, by using s
any of the arts of the courtier. Yet he is a a
very popular, and useful member, and in every
respect an honour to the State. The t
writer has seen him often,in his place on the r
judiciary committee. It is there when his j c
counsel is so important, that he exerts the j r
greatest influence upon legislation. lie t
examines every matter with the utmost *
caution, and detects at a glance, and ex- i
poses to view,every objection to which the L
proposed measure may be liable. He takes e
nothing on faith, but every subject matter, r
to the crucible of his own powerful and 1
discriminating mind. He has the moral a
firmness to ?iy "no," whenever duty to s
9 country requires it?I need not add it!
a rare, and valuable quality, and that th
would be well for the*'state, if her ciU. oj
ins could number many more among her i
ins, who are distinguished by the posses- n
on of if.'- In person, Mr. BiirV is very

id has an eye that shoots out its glances,

and firmness, claim for him the G
