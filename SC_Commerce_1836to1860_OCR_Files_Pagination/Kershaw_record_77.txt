y leKefing the embnrA^smenls of the mer

' great genius who presides over their dcs- [
tinies. It is eminently calculated to
drain the specie from the United States
at this moment, and to provide for period- ,
ical drains in future. It is equally calculated
to produce recurrence of pressure
aud panics. It places the merchants at
the mercy of the hank, whenever its |
bonds shall become due, and what is never
lost sight of by that institution, it
b.itigs in somewhere about two hundred
per cent, a month interest for the loan of
its credit. In addition to this, jt gains for

at the cost of future ruin, and the character
of a great public benefactor besides.
There can be no doubt that there is at
this moment, an understanding, not to
call it a conspiracy, between the Bank of
the foiled States and the Bank of En
gland, to filch from us the specie acquired
by the wise measures of Gen. Jackson.?
Thev are kindred institutions, ami equally
c uubining the?incoiigriioii8 and incompu- .
tilde characters of a commercial body,
and a political engine. So long as the 1
Bank of the foiled States wields such an
enormous capital, under any administration,
we shall have nothing but a miserable
succession of contractions and expansions,
redundant excess of issue, and <
sud.leu withdiawals of credit, panics, i
pressures, and all the long train of evils
we have endured ever since the people
and Government of the United States refu-o-d
to fall down and worship the Paper
Calf, gilt with gold.

With regard to the connection of the

it is one of a close affinity of

them success.
Ano her organ affirms that "very large
sums of the precious metuls were brought
here where they were not wanten.** And
a third denounces the specie, most especially
"because it prevents specie returning

They laboi under u hydrophobia of specie,

the Rank of the united States, the

the federal orators in and out of Congress
together with the bank newspapers, all
harmoniously unite in denouncingtheonlv

NEW YoKK, April 12.
Fugitive M,avk.? Yesterday the 1?^
corder's office was crowded to excess, on
account ol the arrest 'if a colored ma

stave. The claimant is a Doctor AllanJer,
of Baltimore, who says the real name
of the accused is Jacob Ellis. Mr D?-e.sser,
counsel to the Abolitionist Society,
appeared en behalf of the prisoner, and
contended that he was not the man al

the lean ed Counsel seem convinced of
this. i!t:tt he raus"il Doctor Allendor, the
claimant, to ' c nrrcstfil while in court, on
a cl ai'Lrr of false imprisonment, lie has
given bail to anstver the charge in the
sum of IJ500. Mr. Morrill, counsel for
the claimant, wishing further time to pro
ctiro witness, the further consideration of
the case was postponed until ill's morning
at eleven. It has caused great excitement
among the colored people.

Mr. I'hecnix the Distriet Attorney and

The sprinkling of white ami Marl; fan-,

continued until three o'clock* at which
lime the Recorder adjourned the Court
until one o'clor'- to-day. The officers
then proceeded to convey the prisoner to
Bridewell. In doing so it v as necessary
to pass through the park, where nearly
two thousand eol red people were assent-'
bled. As might have hern supposed the
prisoner was resetted front he ? ffieers.?
Justice Bloodgood seeing how the matter
stood rushed from the police office with a
posse of officers, and succeeded in seizing
the accused by the collar. But the exertions
of tne magistrate were of n > avail,

not hear the gentleman's defence, lie offered
to give hail to answer the charge ?
INlr. Bloodgood said he would not take
hail for a less sum than ten thousand dollars.
Bail to the amount of 5,000 was offered
and refused. The gentleman eventually
procured hail to the amount reqtiir
ed. A number of colored people wen
then committed on a similar charge.

where it, was said, Dixon was <:oncealed.
After a long search they succeeded in
ferreting him out. He was concealed in (
a coal hold in the yard of Mr. Arthur, a i
jeweller, who, however had no know- (
ledge of the fact. Dixon made no resistance,
and was reconducted to prison.-?
The excitement during this scene was unparralleled

Some of the effects.?A highly respectable
gentlemun from Virginia, was in
this city a day or two since, on his way
home from Mississippi, and gave some
facts in r'dation to the money affairs which
were well worthy of serious considers- 1

A planter had about 30 negroes taken by |
the Sherill" and sold at auction. There
was a crowd assembled?hut one or two
bidders were found. The 30 negroes
were knocked off for a little more than
four thousand dollars. The crowd gathered
about the purchaser and warned
him not to pay f<?r the negreos, for lie
should not have them ? their neighbor's |
property shoul I not he thus saerificcd.? I
The consequence nvas, the negroes went
back to their master. At Vieksburg, he
found an aequaintauee with 20 or 30 nogroe*
for sale. The man could g 't no mo !

and willingness to sustain a PAVER for this purpose,
Mr Jones & Co. became the purchasers of

It is bid enough for those who hava
laid themselves under heavy liabilities, to
suffer from the consequences of one of
those sudden reverses in the prosperity of
a State, which must occasionally take
I place, without entailing by legal enacttnenls,
a similar misfortune upon all whom
have, under a firm belief in the validity
of contractors, become creditors for large
amounts to the unfortunate. If men will
go in debt they should make up their
minilti Id riiii rial; nf roiispniinnrcH. xnrl
for the ciril authorities, because they have
unexpectedly met with disastrous results,*
to screen them from the obligations im?
posed on all debtors, is to encourage fraud,
dishonesty and injustice. What is right ,
or proper in the case of a portion of tilt
citizens of ^ State should always be so it)
the rase of an individual, in order tlut
the laws may be equal, yet were any Stall:
to grant a special privilege to an individ?
unI to go free from the poymeut of hit
liabilities for a particular period, on ih4
plea that he had been un.'ortunale and hid'
net, while involving himself, anticipated
the occurrence of dilHicuhies which would
prevent the fultilmenl of his engagements?"*
the measure would be spurned at b\ the
public at large as unjust in the extreme,
and well calculated to bring all legislative
authority into contempt. There can bo
no circumstances which in our opinion will
justify a State in ljHping her citizens from
the faithful exec^^fetffcf their contracts.
Contracts should as sacred and
binding by governments as the very principles
upon which those governments aro
based, and the moment a different sentiment
begins to pFevnil, the stability of civil
institutions becomes questionable.
Were the question property investigated,
wed ubt v? ry much whether st< ict scrurity
would not place it beyond tne power of
anv legislature to ai.tful and in.difv exist
in# coinl arts. JSucli power we regnr * as
being more properly ^yiveste-' in the pe pie
themselves, and t* 4>^exe'c'se s lely by n
convention. f-om#M?ia\ argue it is true,
thai r? lief laws d not m reality, impair
contracts, and being intended for tin advantage
of citizens, are among the adiuissable
acts of a legislature, wli se duty is to
make laws for the benefit o1' the citizens,
of a State. Hut it shou d be renu mbered
that an\ alteration ?f a contract, however
slight in jls nature, implies a power to in <ke
a further and greater change, until etentuaUy
the contract should be vi tuaily an: idle
i-or so far mod.fn d as to be near)) invalid.
Ther? is not nor ran be any meoiuua
ground, and the moment a contra"! is
touched, the same power may destroy :ts
f rcc entirely. Hut were it now possible for
a legisla'u e t-. exercise the past power < ver
contracts, the propriety of -uch a cou so is
ren ered donbiful fr >111 the fact that no

on the contrary much injurt may be done.
