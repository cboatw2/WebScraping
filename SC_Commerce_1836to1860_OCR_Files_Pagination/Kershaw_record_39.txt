Dear Sir?Through the medium of
your paper I think it highly necr??.nrv that
the Government of the United Stairs, as
well as the Texians, should be informed
of what presents itself, so odious, in my
opinion, in the chancier of (?cr?. Crrea,
the ' Mexican Commander-in-Chief, too
unpardonable to be overlooked, and
should be immediately attended to bv the
f'nited Slate.
IWc have at tliis moment here G or 7
Indian chief* Cher?kecsand other tribes,
with their interpreter, from Texas.?
These Indians are on a mission to the
Genera), and hare had several private
t meetings with him. There exists no
; doubt of the business they came on, and
j have made propositions to the General to
join the Mexicans against the Tcxians,
which appears now to be concluded. As
Colonel WatcrchcA is to be despatched
to-morrow to their camp, some distance
up the river, where they have 30 or 40 in
number, to be used as spies or runners.
1 had occasion to call on General Urrea
; at his quarters on business, when I inet
' there three of the Indians, with their in*
tcrpreter making enquires of the strength,
of their tribe, the General being anxious!
to ascertain what force they cqtfld muster
with the other tribes.
The commissary of this place has orders
to purchase' 600 or 1000 horses for the
cavalry, which he is now doing. Every
muremcnl appears to confirm the belief
that the negocialion is concluded, with a
promise to the Indians of land and cattle,
?hould they assist and succeed in cxlcr*
initialing the population of Texas.

Dear Fritiul:?Through the criminal

i to put in use s certain stratagem tosavr
jour country and ourselves. You will
hare to lend a hand to its execution, u

after witnessing the utter destruction of
the republic. Such is the boldness ol
Jour revolutionary radicals, and the weak
i ncss of gov. rnmcnt, thai from this liinr
up to the moment when you adopt this
plan, you will neither receive money or
soldiers; you must, ere now, be convinced
of the truth of the first point; as t?the
second, a more positive proof cannot
be given than the sudden hah of the arm}
of rc-i rve. Such then, is the propel method
of executing uiy plan: all.opinionmust
be generalized: above all, a letter
must be written to the government of ihi?
capital, mentioning rery particularly lha
all the army tratil a Dictator to be appointed,
who will remain in office until Tcxa*
be restored to the republic. Who will be
the man? No mailer; porhaps Valencia,
for he is at the same time the hope and Tea:
of man)'.
This idea is not so much to put ihe plat
[InlO execution, an to gcta puwprlckt c??njgTCSS
to invest tlnrgnTtrnmeni wiili ai:
power to restrain ihe revolutionary spi- il?.
and enlist new soldiers to carry on ih?|
war and maintain good order, i hav<
