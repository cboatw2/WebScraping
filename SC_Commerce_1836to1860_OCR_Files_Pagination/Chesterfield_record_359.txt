The climate bf the South 'of France,
thengh itf general so gonial" and delightful,
- is ?tHl not-*, without sqpie alloy. In ihe
spring and summer ihomhsj" spells of wenth
er occur which the inhabitants c:\Wtouffes.
Tlie a?r dating a touJTe is desciibecj by
Bourdon iss having iiigh temperature,
being at the saiwrtiinosta'gtmut, and aimost
s^urated with watery vaper. The winds
preceding and- produHng those spels, blow
from the south, and are generally regarded
as a coalman; ion of the A'rican simoon,
modified somewhat by its passage over the
Mediteraoeun, but not deprived of all its
deleterious quatajes. Those lotilf s generally
ocour at the nr?o*l critical stage of rear,
tog. fcamely,"whf n the worms have attained
the fifih and last age; a period when a
prodigious quantity of leaves and litter are
spread through tho apartm^f; when the
bodies of the worms throw off enormous
quanth.es of solid, - liquid-, vaporeous and
ffaseotkT tn-iHers; when ihe' bus'tes and
other conveniences placed for the worms to
mbtmt upon and 'spin, almost'stop tip the
Spaces between thh' shelve, thus- seriously
^ inurfering with the means of ventil^ion, so
indispensable at tb?s moment. Dreadful
as are thu effects-pr? htctfd by
the touffe itself, they arojjreatly increased
by the diseases to which it predisposes the
worms, the most formidable'among which
is fliat Qatted miHcardine. 14 It is towards
the dose of iheso-atiflmg spells," sys Piu
vis* "that diseases show themselves among
the silk worms, and that the muscardtnc
s makes i:a appearance, (t is under their influence,
when they occur daring the las;
age of feeding, that the worm, not ha.ving
aUained to perfect maturity, moves to every
direction, and endeavors to mount before it
has assimilated a sufficient quantity of leaves
to admit of its making a srong cocoon.?
Driven by an instinct which prompts it to
avoid destruction, it hastens to mount and
form rapidly a feeble cocoon, which only
suffices to enable it to continue the course
"^pSEn^oTfte^St culiure ?n ^rome,

this terrible scourge. I hare seen one lo.
calhy where atumpts Jo raise worms, cont:nueJ
ihrough a period of fifteen years, liad

out yet been satisfactorily explained."
We do not tbmk it necessary to cite any
more evidences of the disadvantages experienced
in France by tliose who pursue tr>p
silk cohure, even in the most favored Departments.
The obstacles thus encounter,
ed, although they must limit the production
do not, hntvevi r, prevent the culture of sflk
from being there the most profitable of nil
brtmohestff agricuhu/v. What, then, must
the sifk'culture.prove, at no distant day, tn

enough to cover ihe increased c>cpenso of
labor in this country w?fe this even much
greater than U- is. - But what after nil, is the
additional cost of labor required to raise
silk in the United States ? To answer this
question, we must first ascertain tho price
of labor in France, and this we are fortunately
able to do, by reference to the best
authority.
In a statement, by Bourdon, of the expenses
incurred in feeding the product of
ten ounces of silk worm eggs, the wng<*s of
man are set down at 40 cents per day, women
at 25 cents per day, and chilJren at
20 cents per day. The services of men
were, however, ia very small proportion,
amounting to only 4 days* work in the 4th
oge, and 16 in tho 6th age of feeding;
all the rest of the labor is charged for the
services of women and children, chiefly the
former; the*w bole cost for feeding sod attearing
tho produce of ton ounces of eggs
being 265 francs (about $53) including
rrithfiMnM tt?A / Lul ni/v* limit* r?not \
luavr^i \ UUi U\Jy U*UI4 vwji,y
as, also, picking off the cocoons..
It may bo said the prices of labor just,
given are such as mnv be usual in the central
pai ls of France, whilst in the South the
rates are. lower. An extract from Bourdon
will afford the best answer to this suggestion.
*u - ' !
"When" (6ays he) "I compare the re- 1
suits of my calculations with tho statements
] have received from many feeders of the
Souih, and, among others, of one residing
near Toulon. I fear that I have estimated
the profits at too low a rate. The person to
whom I allude, w ho is bodi feeder and planter,
utformod me that the price of labor, as
well ns the price ofland, ire in his part of
thecguntry, very nearly the same qs in tl?e
environs of Paris."
In many portions of ot^r country, especially
in 'he more populous neighborhood*
th? same service! may be obtained at very |
little, if any, crcater prices than-those mentioned
by Bourdon, But, admitting the
expense to be increased.50 or even 100 p?r
cent, above the esdmute of Bourdon, the silk
cul.oro would still remain a source of very
great profit in this country, especially with
those who raise their own leaves. The
feeder of ten ounces of egg9, by bes'owing.
proper care, might expect to procure crops
: much greater tj>an those ordinarily obtain*
ed in the South of France, Bourdon, in.
the estimate referred to, takes ibis for grant,
ed, and therefore, instead of 25, sets down
50 kilogrammes as the produce per ounce,
at which modi rate rato the crop would
.amount to about 1200 lbs. of cocoons.?
I These, if sold at 35 cents per lb. would bring
$420 ; and if reeled into nice raw s Ik, and
sold at $5 per H># would bring $550. So
1 tbat a fitrmer, able to feed the produce often
; Purrees of silk worm egg*, might certainly
calculcatc upon.rcceiving from the produce
quite us'muqh, and perhaps more, than from
a handsome field of wheat or Indian corn,
upon which thh.cost of labor would be far
greater. The ordinary product of his land
might thus be doubled, ostheport'on required
for the mufbery trees would b? smill,
! probably not exceeding one, or ,at must,
; two acres.
1 Supposing that the silk worms were
reuied under the most favorable circumstances
to their health, growth, and development,
so that the produce equalled thar
obtained in Italy by Count Reioa, namely,
j 75 kilogrammes, or 165 lbs. of cocoons ta
i the ounce of eggs, then would the proceeds,
of the crop# at the prices mentioned, be
swelled to $377, supposing the cocoons
J sold, or $323, supposing them reeled in o.
j raw silt. We prefer citing the experience
1 of' Count Reiua, as it shows the annual
| average produce of the readings effected h)
t the various cocooneries upon bis estates,
j near Come, in Loin bar Jy, xoithoul the aid,
I of the forced system pursued in France by
| Beauvais and others in obtaining tboir large
J crops. v
i A certain amount of labor may always
boderrvcd from persons on t]-e premses,
especially as lire principal feeding time oc.
xurs ju>t before wheat harvest. . But f-w

makes us incidentally acquainted with jh<>

.'d by his tree cause it to be bttlo eulti

of its foliage." ;
Having just rofcrrc 1 to the mu'ticaulis
and its varieties, we take tho ociasion to
/protest against the n:nra*s Chinese and
Cn/ttoa-muhierry, frequently applied to tt e
j genuine multicauK of rerrotet. This French
j botanist found the parent of what ho called
: the niul.icauiia tree?the same now so vx*
( tensivcly cultivated among us?not in China,
| but in the Philippine Islands, Ii is distin.
.] guished for pr.-ducing the largest leaves of
j any mulberry known, these having a pocu
liar bowl shape* So far as we have any ev.
dencc, this treo is not found in Cnina.?
j But they have in that country varieties of
j the mulberry which very much resemble
lire multicaulis. Many of these are now
! growing in tSiia country from seed brought
| from Canton. We have seen them at;
tain in one season six and seven feot in
j height, from seed plunted.in the spring.?
I The leaves are large, but kss than those
| of tho genuine Perrottnt multicaulis- They
j are not puckered and bowl-shaped, but per.
i fectly flat. Tho tree is beautiful and proj
ductive in foliage, and is doubtless what the
Chinese mainlev depend upon-in the culture
of silk. To Call the genuine multij
cuulis of Perrottet tho C.hinese or Canton
I mulberry is obviously very improper, as
those names are only applicable to the proj
ducts of seed imported from the Celestial
i Empire*
We will now proceed !o notice some of
the circumstances to which ihe climate of
the United Slates owes its great superiority
for the silk cuhurfe. It appears, from actual
observat on, that places much exposed
to the atmosphere of the ocean are ur.favor.
able to tins branch of industry, probably
from tho ill effects of much dampness
upon the worms, as well as upon
the mulberry tree, but chiefly he form;
er. Great efforts have been made
! to introduce the silk culture into Ir< land,
| and even in'o England, but always without
1 success. Nor dot hey even succeed well
i in France, until they gel a considerable disI
mnce from the. Atlan ie, principal silk dis.
| tricts being nearly all situated on the east
i of the Cevennes mountains, whic h running
| up from the Pyrenees to the Swiss Alps,
1 form the western side of the basin of the
i Rhone a comparatively small r?g on. ' In
tho United Srates,however, thecase isdifferent,
the climate being favorable to the
health of the silkworm nnd to tho growth of
the mulberry tree, down to the very edge of
the ocean.
Tiio reason of all this can "be readily ex.
plained, as it mainly depends upon the
iiiii II
well known predom nance of westerly winds.

Resolved, That tire brig Enterprise, which was
reed unavoidably by stress of weuthcr into Port
amiiton, Bermuda island,while on a lawful voy.
[n on Hie high,seas front one port"f the Union

in the foregoing resolutions ; ami that the sei.
ire and detention of tne negroes on board by the
cat authority of the Island, was un act in viola,

of the bearing of these resolutions,

ecessarv to give a brief narrative of each
f these cases. , ,
Ti?e Comet it the first in order of time. .
Ibe sa led from thisDistrict in the jitter,
art of the year 183Q, destined for N**w Or- vy
;an9, h "Ving, among other things, a number y
f negroes on board. Her papers were re _
;ii!ar, and the voyage in ail respects lawful
>li?* was stranded on one of .he false keys
f the Bahama island, opposite to the coast
if Florida, and almost ui sight of our own C
hores The persons on board, including ri
he negroes, wereiak-n by he wreckers, u- h
[iiMist the remonstrance of die captain and (
iwners, into Nassau, New Pro.%ideoce, o
vhere ihe negroes wore forcibly soizidand C
let lined by the local author, ties. , !
The case o? the Bnromium is in almost I
very par'ieuJur similar. It occyred in m
1824. She sailed fnyn Charleston, destin- F
id, also, to New Orleans, with negroes on F
>oard, on a voyage, in like manner liwful, c
he same way, into the same port, where the
i?'i?roes were also forcibly seined-and de- f
uin' d by the lea! suthoiities. It so hap- "
xwtg hat I am jiersonally acquainted with' a
:h<* owm rs of toe negroes in tins ca.-.e. They

Mutability. jone of them recently President I
ifthe Siate Senate, and their negroes were
n ipped for New Orleans, w*h the view ol
jmigrat i n and p< rmnnent settlement in one
if Hie S'.uthw sum States.
The ol; er is the case of the Enterprise, ^
r? f? rr d 10 in the resolutions. S> e swled, <!
in 1835. from this District,,desiincl for 1
21m11 stun, South Carolina, and, like the
jiliers. on a lawful voyage, with r'gular pa

Such are the nia-mial facts, drawn from
he correspondence itself, and almited in \
he cour.vof the n got-ation Wlyil I pro- o
?ose. in.the first place, is to show that the r

hat no discrimination. whatever can he t
nade between them ; and that iii at emp in? c
o make a discrimination, the British Minis- p
er has assumed the very point in contro. t
'crsy, or to express it in more famil ar Ian- f
[uage, has begged the question. 1 shall rest s
ny argument exclusively on li e admissions v
iecessanly involved in the two cases, with- i:
