Mr, W. made some remarks,.in which
he condemned in very strong language,
the course of the British Government'l a
issuing the circulars in question.
Mr. Jarnagin thought that "sufficient to
the day was the evil. thereof.'' He argu
ed that it was not worth while to quarrel
with the British Government about an ab-.
stract proposition. But-if she were to at
tempt to punish a naturalized citizen of
this country for purchasing slaves,-then,
he allowed, there would be a case requir

MISCE LLANEOUS.
TREATY W1T H TIlE ZOLI VE
REIN.
It is rumored that the treaty lately con
cluded between the United States and the
German Customs Union is to b e rejcted
by the Senate. This treaty, we collect
from the debates in the British'Parliament,
is a matter of exceeding anxiety to the
British ministry. It provides for the ad
mission, at very low rates, of tobacco, rice,
and hemp into the German Confederation;
and the United States, on their part, re
ceive, at moderate fixed rates of duty, the
linens and cutlery of Germany in return.
It is impossible, so far as the South and
Southwest is concerned, that a treaty
could be.riire'just and advantageous; and
if the Government was adninistered at
all with a view to their interests and wel
fare, it would undoubtedly pass. the Sen
ate. -
The manufacturers have all along been
declaiming against free trade,- as they
called it, on our side only. Let the na
tions of Europe put out our. export on a
low -footing of taxation, an4:tbeq it.will be
just to remit ours-but nohbefor.- Well,
here is th- very arrangement they desired.
There is a mutual remission-of duties be
tweenihe United States end thirty'mil
liorn of people in Europe. Will they
consent? They will not. The truth is,
all their talk of the duties of foreign na
tions on Atmerican productions, was a
mere pretext to operate on the tobacco
planter, and the grain- power, to hitch
them to -their nefarious policy. The to
bacco planters had special agents appoint
ed and sent out to Europe, to obtain the
remission of dtities on their product, on
the part of foreign nations, and to enforce
the principle of reciprocal free, trade.
They succeed. The duties are remitted,
and an immense market'for their staple is
thrown opeti; but-the manufacturers, and
agents of the manufactut ers in thie-Senate,
step3 forw~ard and say, this 'vont do. We 1i
are sorr-j you were such gulls as toi believe1
us. We will not, for your tobacqo or a ny
thing else, allow any competitionwith our
manufacturers. We-make' no-liens,' it is I
true, hut we- make cottons; andl linens
m,. -a't be used instead of cottonsg.Let the'
six hundred or ten thousand per cent. bei
kept or: your tobacco; thbat is your loss.1
We iend to loiose nothing, and risk noth
ng, for you. Don't you go for 'the pro.
tection of manufactures ? If you can't sell
it abroad, why so mtuch the better ; home
market, you know-eat it yourself.4
The tr-uth is, and it is uselessto attempt
to-disguise it, neither by treatIes-abroad,4
by laws within, are the South' any thing
but colonies. Their interests an control
led like that of all colonies, by thie interests
of the North ; and to be plundered~ abroad
and at home, seems to be .the fate of the
whole 'agricultural region, of tbifecountry.
This treaty -has ot -been putblished by
the-Senate, it is kept'dark; 'lEhe dan
ufacturers intend, if possible, to murder it
in silence. But murder. will oitt, and so
will this treaty, and itiwill be another in

are fully satisfied with its'deeission on -e

In the Senate this morning, there was a
whole regiment of memorials from Phila
delphia, strongly urging an amendment of
the Naturalization lawsso that no. for
signer can become a citizen without a no
tice of 21 years. Many of -the memori
als are written in a very bad spirit, evi
dently arising from the recent riots in the
above city. - Of course there can be no
action on the subject, at thd' present sea
lion. -
Memorials in great numbers were pre
sented from various quarters in favor of
he immediate annexation of Texas.
The Civil and Diplomatic appropriation
ill from thigBouse, was taken up and re
rerred to tirFinance Committee.
A fter thedisposal of some resolutions of
0o special importance, the doors were
loved, and the consideration of the Texas
mealy once more resumed. It was still
under discussion when the mail closed.
rhe vote will probably not be taken be
bre midnight.
In the House notice was given by Mr.
Hopkins, that he will. on Monday call up
he Post Office reform bill.
Mr: Davis of Ky., moved a suspension
>f the rulee,.for the purpose of introducing
isrresolution, directing the Post Office
Committee to inquire whether the Post
naster General has not. abused-his office,.
iut without success.
Just before the House adjourned, a mes
lage was receivedt from the President. It
was not opened, but the general impres
sion is that it is either a veto of the Har
ors, or the Texas papers. If it be'the
atter, we shall without doubt have the
texas question up on Monday, in the
shape of a joint resolution.
As only six days remain of the session,
t is evident that many important bills.
ill be left untouched.. There was a ru
nor this morning that an -attempt would
is made to rescind the joint resolution of
Ldjournment; but I am told it would stand
to chance.
It appears that Duff Green is not going
o Texas, as Charge, but in some private
apacity.
ro-morrow afternoon, several members
f Congress. will hold 'a Temperance
neetingon. the Portico of the Capital, to
ommemorate the passage of the joint rea
lution, prohibiting the sale of intoxica
iog liquors in the Capitol.
It is believed that the Senate will not
oncur' in that clause of the Navy bill
hich abolishes- corporal punishment in
he Navy. . It is argued that sailors are in
eneral. too degraded to be affected by
noral punishment.
Inihe Senate this morning, agreat num
ir of-memorials in favor of the annexation
if Texas, and asking a change in the nat
ralization law, were presented and re
it. reference to the latter, a discus
ion arose, in the course of which it was
licited that the Judiciary Committee will
lot have tirme to report on the subject at
he present ssion.
The joints resolution of M r.-'McDuffie,
roviding for -the annexation of Texas,.
ras taken up. and by a vote of 26 to 19,.
id on the -table.
Mr. Benton called up his Texas bill, and
nade some trivial amendments. This liull
hn-took its place on~ the calendar. It is~
inerstood that no- further action on the
ubject is tobe had at the present session.
'Theis eminder ofthe day was spent in
zective session.
lanthe .H.use, a volumnious message
was received from the President, relative
o theanliezation ofTexis.
Tihers being, a loud:eall for the reading,
he message was read by the Clerk.
