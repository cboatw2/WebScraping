THE VETO MESSAGE.
IIolSE OK REPRESENTATIVES?AugtlS/ 9, 1812.
The following message was received
from the President of the United States :
To the House of Representatives
of the United Stales:
It is with unfeigned regret that I find myself
under the necessity of returning to the House of I
.
Representatives, with my objections, a bill tntitlsd
" An act to provide revenue from imports, and to
change and modify existing laws imposing duties
on imports, and for other purposes." Nothing can
i ll?-w 1 mwift fn
be more paint ul to any inuiviuuo? v.
perforin the chief Executive duties under our limited
Constitution, than to be constrained to withhold
his assent from an inij>ortunt measure adopted
by the Legislature; yet he would neither fulfil
the high purposes ot his station, nor consult the
ti uc interests or the solemn will of the People, the
common constituents of both branches of the
Government, by yielding his well-considered, most'
deeply-fixed, and repeatedly declared opinions on I
matters of great public concernment to those of a j
co-ordinate department, without requesting that I
department seriously to re-examine the subject of1
their difference. The exercise of some independence
of judgment in regard to all acts of legislation
is plainly implied in the resjmnsihility of approving
them : at all times a duty, it becomes a peculiarly
solemn and imperative one, when the subjects
pissed upon by Congress happen to involve, as in
the present instance, the most momentous issues, to
affect variously the various parts of a great country,;
and to have given rise in all quarters to such a
conflict of opinion as to render it impossible to
conjecture, with any certainty, on which side the i
majority really is. Surely, if the pause for reflection
intended hv the wise authors of the Constitu- I
tion, by referring the subject buck to Congress for
reconsideration, be ever expedient and necessary, |
it is precisely such a ease as the present.
On the subject of distributing the proceeds of
tiie sales of the public lands, in the existing state !
of the finances, it has been my duty to make
known my settled convictions on various occasions
during the present session of Congress. At the
opening of the extra session, upwards of twelve
months ago, sharing fully in the general hope of
returning prosjierity and eredit, I recommended j
such a distribution ; but that recommendation was
even then expressly coupled with the condition
that the duties on imports should not exceed the
rate of 20 per cent, provided by the compromise
uct of 1633. These hopes were not a little en- j
couraged and these views strengthened by the re-!
l>ort of Mr. Ewing, then Secretary of the Treasu- I
rv, winch was shortly thereafter laid 1^-forr Con- j
grtss, in which he recommended the imposition of'
duties at the rate of 20 per cent, ad valorem on all I
free articles, with specified exceptions; and stated,
44 If this measure be adopted there will lie received '
in the Treasury from customs, in the last quarter j
of the present year, (1811,) 8~>?3 )0,000; in all of i
the year 18-15, about ?55,500,000; and in the j
rear 1843, after the final reduction under the act j
of March 5, 1?33, about 820,800,000and 1
adds, 14 It is believed that after the heavy expend
itures required by the public service in the present!
year shall have been provided for, the revenue
which will accrue from that, or nearly a proximate
rate of duty, will be sufficient to defray the |
expenses of the Covcrnmcnt, and leave a surplus-)
to be annually applied to the gradual payment of j
the national debt, leaving the proceeds of the pub. I
lie lands to be disposed of as Congress shall see j
fit." I was most happy that Congress, at the
time, seemed entirely to concur in the recommendations
of the Executive, and, anticipating the
correctness of the Secretary's conclusions, and in j
view of an actual surplus, passed the distribution !
act of the 4th September last, wisely limiting its
operation by two conditions, having reference, j
both of them, to a posssible state of the Treasury, j
different from that which had been anticipated by
the Secretary of the Treasury, and to the paramount
necessities of the public service. It or.
daincd that " if at any time during the existence
of that act there should be an imposition of duties
on imj>orts inconsistent with the provision of the
act of the 2d March, 1833, and beyond the rate
of duties fixed by that act, to wit, 20 per cent, on
the value of such imports or any of them, then the j
distribution should be stis|>ciidcd, and should eon- J
tinuc so suspended until that cause should be removed."
Ily a previous clause it had, in a like
spirit of wise and cautious patriotism, provided for
another case in which all are even now agreed
that the proceeds of the sales of the public lands ;
should be used for the defence of the country. It
was enacted that the act should continue and be I
in force until otherwise provided by law, unless
the United Statis should become involved in war
with any foreign I'owcr, in which event, from the i
commencement of hostilities, the act should be '
suspended until the cessation of hostilities.
-Not long after the opening of the present session
of Congress, the unprecedented and extraordinary I
difficulties that have recently embarrassed the ti-1
nances of the country begau to assume a serious !
o T? tv.nn?,n ?l.o? ,1...
? yvvu 11 a" V.UIUV. i \ i?vm uiui tin i
hopes under which the act of 4th Scptcml>cr was j
p isscd, and which alone justified it in the eyes !
c ther of Congress who imposed or of the Executive
who approved the first of the two conditions j
just recited, were not destined to be fulfilled. Un- j
der the pressure, therefore, of the embarrassments !
which hau thus unexpectedly arisen, it appeared to j
me that the course to be pursued had been clearly
marked out for the Government by that act itself.
The condition contemplated in it as requiring a
suspension of its operation, hadoccurred. It became
necessary, in the opinions of all, to raise the rate I
of duties ujion imports above 20 per cent., and,
with a view both to provide available means to
meet present exigencies, and to lay the foiuidation !
lor a successful negotiation of a loan, I felt it in
cuinbont upon n?e to urge ujkv.i Congress to raise |
ihc duties accordingly, imposing them in i spirit j
ol a wise discrimination, for the two-fold object of/
affording ample revenue for the Government and !
incidental protection to the various branches of
domestic industry. 1 also pressed, in the most j
t mphatic but respectful language I could employ,'
the necessity of making the land sales available j
to the Treasury as the basis of public credit. I
did not think that I could stand excused, much
le** justified, lx fore the people of the United States,
nor could I reconcile it to myself to recommend
the imjK?si:ion of additional taxes upon them, j
without at the same time urging the employment
of all the legitimate means of the Government towards
satisfying its wants. These opinions were !
communicated in advance of any definitive action ?
of Congress on the subject ebhor of the tariff*or j
1 nd sab-*, tmdur a high seme of public duty, and i
n compliance with an express injunction of,'
{.lit Constitution ; no that i: a collision, extremely j
to be deprecated, as such collisions always arc, I
has seemingly arisen between the Executive and
Legislative branches of the Government, it has J
assuredlv not been owing to any capricious inter, j
fcrencc, or to any want of a plain and frank dc- j
duration of opinion on the part of the former.? ;
Congress differed in its views with those of the j
Executive, as it had undoubtedly a right to do, 1
and passed a hill virtually for a time repealing tiie j
proviso of the act of the 4th September, 1841.? 1
The bill was returned to the House in which it !
originated with iny objections to its becoming a
law. With a view to prevent, if possible, an open j
disagreement of opinion on a point so important,
1 took occasion to declare that I regarded it as an '
indispensable prc-requisite to an increase of duties 1
above 'JO per ernt., that the act of the 1th Scptem- '
her should remain unrepealed in its provisions. ]
My reasons for that opinion were elaborately set i
forth in the message which accompanied the re- \
turn of the bill?winch no constitutional majority
appears to have been found for passing into a law.
The bill which is now before nic proposes, in its
27th section, the total repeal of one of the provisos
in the act of September, and while it increases the
duties alovc 20 per cent, directs an unconditional
distribution of the land proceeds. I am therefore
subjected a second time, in the period of a few
: days, to the necessity of either giving my approval
' to a measure which, in my deliberate judgment,
j is in conflict with great public interests, or of rc'
turning it to the House in which it originated,
with my objections. With all my anxiety for the
1 passage of a law which would replenish an e.x!
liausted Treasury, and furnish a sound and hcalj
thy encouragement to mechanical industry, 1
| cannot consent to do so at the sacrifice of the
| peace and harmony of the country, and the clear,
j est convictions of public duty.
For some of the reasons which have brought
I me to this conclusion, I refer to my previous nicsI
sages to (."ongret*, and briefly subjoin the follow.
j in?:
1. The hill unites two subjects, which, so far
; from having any affinity to one another, are wholly
I incongruous in their character. It is both a revenue
and an appropriation bill. It thus imposes
: on the Executive, in the first place, the necessity
j of either approving tint which lie would reject,
or rejccti lg that which he might otherwise approve.
This is a species of constraint to which the judgment
of the Executive ought not, in my opinion,
to be subjected. l>ut that is not rny only objection
to the act in its present form. The union of
subjects wholly dissimilar in their character in the
same bill, if it grew into a practice, would not fail
to lead to consequences destructive of all wise and
conscientious legislation. Various measures, each
agreeable only to a small minority, might, by
l>cing thus united, and the more the greater chance
of success, lead to the passing of laws, of which
no single provision could, if standing alone, command
a majority in its favor.
2. While the Treasury is in a state of extreme
embarrassment, requiring every dollar which it
can make available, and when the Government
Ins not only to lay additional taxes, but to borrow
money to meet pressing demands, the bill proposes
to give away a fruitful source of revenue?
which is the same thing as raising money by loan |
and taxation?not to meet the wants of the gov.
eminent, but for distribution, a proceeding which
I must regard as highly impolitic, if not unconsti. j
tutional.
A brief review of the present condition of the 1
public finances will serve to illustrate the true condition
of the Treasury, and exhibit its actual nc- |
ccssitics. On the 5th of August, (Friday last,)
there was in the Treasury, in round numbers,
8^,150,000 j
Necessary to he retained to
111 ct trust funds .... ?300,000
Interest on public debt due
in October 80,000
To redeem Treasury Notes
and pay the interest - - - 100,000
Land Distribution, under the
act of 1th Sept., lb 11 - - frit),000
?1,180,000 I
I-caving an available amount of - - - ?070,000 j
The Navy Department had drawn requisitions j
on the Treasury, at that time, to meet debts actu- !
ally due, among which are bills under protest for
?1,111,000, thus leaving an actual deficit of i
? 114,000.
There was on hand about ?100,000 of unissued
Treasury notes, assisted by the accruing revenue, '
amounting to about ?1500 per week, exclusive of
receipts on unpaid bonds,, to meet requisitions for i
the Army, and the demands of the civil list.
The withdrawal of the sum of ?040,000 to be
distributed among the States, so soon as the state- i
ments and accounts can be made up and compk t- .
ed by virtue of the provisions of the act of the 1th
September last, of which nearly a moiety goes to a j
few States and only about ?3^3,000 is to be divi- j
iled among all the States, while it adds materially ;
to the embarrassments of the Treasury, allbrds to
the States no decided relief.
No immediate relief to this state of things is an?
ticipated, unless, what would most deeply be de- [
plored, the (iovernnicnt could be reconciled to the j
negotiation of loans already authorized by law, at j
a rate of discount ruinous in itself, and calculated j
most seriously to affect the public credit. So great >
is the depression of trade, that even if the present ,
bill were to Income a law, and prove to be produc- |
f ive, some time would elapse before sufficient sup- f
plies would flow into the Treasury, while, in the
meantime, its embarrassments would be continual- j
...
ly augmented by the semi-annual distribution of
the land proceeds.
Indeed, there is but too much ground to apprehend
that even if this bill were permitted to become
a law, alienating as it does the proceeds of
tlie land sales, an actual deficit in the Treasury
would occur, which would more than probably involve
the necessity of a rc>ort to direct taxation.
Let it be also remarked, that >?5,;>00,000 of the
public debt becomes redeemable in about two years
and a half, which, at any sacrifice, must be met,
while the Treasury is always liable to demands for
the payment of outstanding Treasury notes. Such
is the gloomy picture which our financial department
now presents, and which calls for the exercise
of a rigid economy in the public expenditures, 1
n.wi ,1... -?,J.I? ,.? ...
iu IUV U llUUUi^ UMIUailll VI liiv IJll.lIIO nillliti
the control of the Government. I most respect- |
fully submit, whether this is a time to give away i
the proceeds of the land salt s, when the public '
lands constitute a fund which, of all others, may (
be made most useful in sustaining the public credit.
t
Can the (.'ovenuncnt be generous and munificent :
to others when every dollar it can command is nc- I
cessarv to supply its own Wants ? Anu if Con.
'rrtw V oulsi not hesitate to sulTcr th?- prjvlsion" o.
the uct of 1th September last to remain unrepealed 1
i 1 case the country was involved in war, is not the
necessity for such a course now just as imperative
as it would be then ? I
3. A third objection remains to be urged, which (
would be sufficient, in itself, to induce inc to re. ' <
turn the bill to the House with my objections. By 1
uniting two subjects so incongruous as Tariff and 1
Distribution, it inevitably makes the fate of the one (
dependent on that of the other in future contests

merchant or manufacturer than such an alliance ? ,

the arena of political contention, ineir crnci i i
want is permanency and stability. Such an in- ' j
crease of the Tariff, I believe to be necessary, in |
order to meet the economical expenditures of gov- I <
eminent. Such an increase, made in the spirit of '
moderation and judicious discrimination, would, <
I have no doubt, be entirely satisfactory to tiie , ;
great majority of the American people. In the I
way of accomplishing a measure so salutary and j
so imperatively demanded by every public interest,
the Legislative Department will meet with a
cordial co-operation on the part of the Executive.
This is all that the manufacturer can desire, and it
would be a burden readily borne by the people.
But I cannot too earnestly repeat, that in order to
be beneficial it must be permanent, and in order to
lie permanent, it must command general acquiescence.
But can such permanency be justly hoped for if
the Tariff question be coupled with that of Distri
bution, as to which a serious conflict of opinion ex- I
ists among the States ant the people, which en- !
lists in support a bare majority, if indeed there be
a majority, of the two Houses of Congress ??
What i>crmancncy or stability can attacli to a measure
which, warring upon itself, gives away a
fruitful source of revenue at the moment it propores
a large increase of taxes on the people ??
Is the maufacturer prepared to stake himself and
his interests upon such an issue ?
I know that it is urged, but most erroneously, in
my opinion, that instability is just as apt to be produced
by retaining the public lands as a source of
revenue as from any other cause, and this is ascribed
to a constant fluctuation, as it is said, in
the amount of sales. If there were anything in
this objection it equally applies to every imposition
of duties on imj>orts. The amount of revenue annually
derived from duties is constantly liable to
change. The regulations of foreign governments,
the varying productiveness of other countries, periods
of excitement in trade, and a great variety of
other circumstances, are constantly arising to affect
the state of commerce, foreign and domestic.
The sahs of the public domain in ordinary times
are regulated by fixed laws, which have their
basis in a demand increasing only in the ratio of
the increase of the jwpulation. In recurring to the
statistics connected with this subject, it will be
perceived that for a period of ten years preceding
1831, the average amount of land sales did not exceed
3d,000,000.
For the increase which took place in 1831?o
and G, we arc to look to that peculiar condition of
the country which grew out oronc of the most extraordinary
excitements in business and speculation
that have ever occurred in the history of commerce
and currency. It was the fruit of wild spirit
of adventure engendered by a vicious system
of credits, under the evils of which the country
is still laboring, and which it is fondly hoped will
not soon recur.
Considering the vast amount of investments
made by private individuals in the public lauds,
during those three years, and which equalled $ 13,000,01)0,
equal to more than 20 years purchase,
taking the average of sales of the ten preceding
years, it may be safely asserted that the result of
the public land sales can hold out nothing to alarm
the manufacturer with the idea of instability in
the revenues, and consequently in the course of the
government.
Under what appears to me, therefore, the soundest
considerations of the public policy, and in view
of the interests of every branch of domestic indus.
try, 1 return you the hill with these, my objections
to its becoming a law.
I take occasion emphatically to repeat my anxious
desire to co-operate with Congress, in the
passing of a law, which, while it shall assist in
supplying the wants of the Treasury and re-establish
public credit, shall afford to the manufacturing
interests of the country all the incidental protection
they require.
After all, the effect of what I do is substantially
to call on Congress to reconsider the subject. If,
on such reconsideration, a majority of two-thirds of
both houses should be in favor of this measure, it
will become a law notwithstanding my objections.
In a ease of clear and manifest error on the part of
the IVcsidenf, the presumption of the Constitution
is that such majorities will be found. Should they 1
be so found in this case, having conscientiously
discharged my own duty, I shall cheerfully acquicscc
in the result.

Agriculture is the foundation of all human ;
arts?the art for which man was made, and ;
the perfection of which is his chief happiness
and glory as the lord temporal of this planet*
Of this eublime art, all other arts and sciences
arc but satellites, their business being to wait
cn, enlighten, and adorn it with their moonshine.
Consequently no man more tnan the
agriculturist needs the full use of his brains,
and a perfect command of all the treasures of
human experience. So the farmers of the
United States view the matter; and in presenling
them with a translation of the celc.
brated .Maison Rustiquc, of the French, we
have no doubt of their hearty support. It ic
the work of all works on practical agriculture
?the most scientific, clear, and ccmpreheri- |
sive, France has long excelled in profitable '
farming. This is the source of her wea'th.
England is rich by coals and commerce. Ucr
agriculture is "splendid, but sometimes costs
more than it comes to. Those who have
fortunes to spend may buy the vast works of
Marshall, Dickson Arthur Young, Loudon,
&c., but those who wish to get a fortune out
of the soil will find the French writers better
able to show them the way. Theexcellence
of French elementary works is well known to
all teachers. For centuries, the il/aison
Rustique has been, in France, the standard
elementary work?the spelling book and
grammar of farming. The present edition for
" the nineteenth century," has been re--written
and brought up witli the " march of mind,"
by sixty of the ablest "agronomes" of France.

Wiiliam Cobbct, one of the most successful

Rustiqucs, not only as an encyclopedia of
farming, but us a means of educating his
children. He was his own schoolmaster. In
winter evenings his family resolved itself into
a school, and he thus speaks of the use then
made of this work:?
