Samuel Governuer Esq., Son-in-law of
the late ex-President Monroe is preparing
4? the press a biography of Mr. Monroe.
At the second annual exhibition of a Agri.
cultural Society at Washington, near Natchez
Mississippi, last Spring, one thousand persons
were present, nearly one third of whom were
Udxcs.
The Bank Bill.
All parties watch with solicitude the
progress of this bill in Congress. Its fate
seems still doubtful. In the Senate,
since the branch question has been decided,
the Whigs have voted together on all
questions involving important features of
the bill, and the.r majority has been from j
4 to 6. It is supposed however that on j
its final passage in its present form, Mr. !
Rives and one or two other Whigs will i
vote against .it; but the general opinion I
seems to be that it will pass. In the
House of Representatives although there ;1
are Whigs who prefer the plan recom. J
mended by the Secretary of the Treasu- j
ry, and others, as in the Senate, who j
though they prefer the present bill, will J
vet vote for the Secretary's plan as a com- (
promise, still if. the anti-Whigs oppose
this plan as they did in the Senate, it canoot
succeed. In that case there oeems
to he little doubt that the bill will pass the
Home. If it should, will the President
?ig? it ? The language of his address to
the people of the United States at the
time of entering upon the duties of the
Pretidency gave rise to a very general
expectation that his mind was made up tot
^ sign such a bill; but the more cautious
language of his message to Congress at
the opening of fne session again threw
doubt upon the course which he seemed 1
willing to let the country know he had
marked out for Himself. It is believed by
many that the Secretary of the Treasury's
plan was adopted bv that officer only in
deference to the ascertained opinion of
the President; and this would set en to be
probable from the fact that the Secretary
himself has no scruples about the power
of Congress to incorporate a bank with
branches in the States. It is also supposed
that the earnest support given by
Mr. Cboate, Senator from Massachusetts,
to this anomalous plan, is to be ascribed j
to intimations from his friend the Secretary
of State that the President had let
hit cabinet know he could not approve a
bill giving power to place branches in the
fitmtes without their consent.
On the other hand the President has
uniformly rrfaintmned the character of a
highminded and honorable man, and it is
contended by the \Vhig9 that although
be was not questioned as Gen. Harrison
was, before the election as to his opinions,
yet the (act of his accepting a nomination
as the candidate for the Vice Presidency,
on the Whig ticket, and the active part
which he continued publicly to take in
their ranks (ill the very time of the electian,
bind him as strictly in honor and
^ good faith to carry out the principles
mw*A iMftinrr mpnaures of the nartv as if he
bad in'thc strongest language expressly J
pledged himself to do so. On this point
there can, indeed, be no question among
honorable nten. It would certainly have
been moat disingenuous and dishonorable
in Mr* Tyler to accept the nomination if
he dissented on material points from the i
known opinions of the party which nominated
him. Was, then, a national bank 1
such in its prominent features as
the country had previously tried, a
Whig . measure, and one of those on
which the election turned? The great ,
hodv of the Whiffs. In every state which
voted for Mr. Tyler, we believe, say it j
was; but Mr. Tyler, in his message at the 1
opening of Congress says it was not. He
naya however in the same document:
** What i? now to be regarded as the judgment
of the American 'people on this
whole subject I have no accurate means
of deter mining, but by appealing to their
immediate representatives." And again:
"To you, then/ who have come more di.
r?M?tlv frnm the hndv of our common con.
,VV'V J -- ?
titueots, I submit the entire question, as
best qualified to give a full exposition of
their wishes and opinions." If this " ex.
position" should be such as to call upon
the President for a fulfilment in good faith
of an implied pledge to sign an old fash,
ioned national bank, whether he will re.
cognise the legitimacy of the call and his
obligation to obey it, is positively known, j
^ we suppose, to very few. If he should veto j
the Senate's bill, will the Whigs retreat
from their ground and adopt the anomalous
scheme of the Secretary of the Treasury?
Some of them will; but whether or not a
sufficient number will *do so to carry
through the measure, there is now no
means of forming even a probable conjee,
tare.
Contrary to strong admonitions a few
young men at Fredonia, New Jersey, un.
dertouk to fire a salute on Sunday the 4th
instant, and in doing ao the cannon ex*
ploded, by which one of the party lost his
hands.

The Metropulitax Rmlroad*
The report of the President of the Raleigh
and Gaston Railroad to the company at the ]
annual meeting in May, gives quite a favorable
account of the affairs and prospects of
the company. On thet subject ot continuing
the road to Columbia the President writes at
follows:
44 It is known to most of you, that when
the Raleigh and Gaston Road was originally
pl inned, it was intended to form one of the
links in the great chain of inland communication
from North to South, and that an extension
of the Road to Columbia in South Carolina,
was at the succeeding Session of the
Legislature authorized, and a Charter obtaini
ed for that purpose. The great revulsion in
the business operations and monetary affairs
of the cout,?.ry. which occured almost immediafely
after the granting of th? Chirter for
the Road to Columbia,-prevented any further
prosecution of that object than tnere'y to ?ecure
the Charter, which required a given
amount of the Stock to be subscribed within
a specified time, and the actual commencement
of the work. The vast importance of '
this Road is now becoming every day more
apparent. The kites of communication by
Rtil Road and Steamboat between Agusta,
in Georgia, and New Orleans, are rapidly
verging towards completion. The Road now
constructing between Columbia and Branchville,
on the Charleston and Hamburg- Road,
is expected to be finished the present sum.
mer. When these Roads are completed and
the Richmond and Fredericksburg Koad snail
be extended to the Potomac, the whole chain
from Boston to New Orleans will be perfected,
except that portion between Raleigh and
Columbia, a distance of only two hundred
miles.?'This central link, which if necessary
to connect the two ends together, and thus
| give permanency and increased value to the
whole, is of too much importance not to be
filled up. The accommodation of th** travel- 1
ling public from one extreme of the Union to I
the other, the safe, certain and expeditious i
transportation of the United States Mail, the |
immense advantage which such s line of internal
communication between North and 1
South would he to the Gpneral Government <
for the speedy transportation of troops in time I
of War,, together with the enhancement of the |
value of the Stock in all the Roa'dft forming a .
part of the great line, form so strong a combination
of interests in its favor as to leave no '
doubt of its construction at no distant peri*
od." * \ * " ' i

THE CROPS.
From information obtained from different
parts of this county, we are inclined '
; to think that, the wheat crop this year
! has fallen short of its usual average. The
ravages of the fly and the chinch bug-1 (
have been very sever#, and many farmers (
lost nearly their whole crops. We shall ! |
however, have an abundance of oats and (
other small grain; likewise af corn should (
the season hold out as favorable as it has ,
been thus far. We have never seen the '
corn crops look more promising at this
season of the year, than they do now. '

FAILURES OF MAILS. ?
It would ' seem that railroad conveyance is '
not more exempt than other modes of mail i
transportation from mishaps and delays. j
These accidents not being generally published,
le've the Public in ignorance of the
causes of inevitable irregularities- in the trans .
portition of the mails, and often subject the '
Post Office Department to censure fur delays 1
resulting from circumstance altogether beyond 1
its control. 1
It is not to be supposed that fines, even if. (
fhoop Kptf.willed c.orDorationa would consent ] <
to make themselves amenable to them in f
their contracts, would induce greater caution
than that which is inspired by higher consid 1
erations to guard against accidents, that en. 1
danger not only the character and custom of 1
the road, but always, more or less, the lives of i
the passengers. ^ ,
To show how failures of the mail may and
do constantly occur on the main lines, we
state that, on the Tuscumbia railroad, (Ala?) <
the mail engine got off the track on the 17th <
ult. On tho next day the mail was lost by j
the meeting of engines and trains. On the ,
21st, on the same road, the train was detain*
ed, and the. mail failed by accident to meet | <
1 the care.. On the Petersburg railroad, the J
- '
mail failed going South on the 2d of June,
owing to the breaking of the axle of the ten- (
der. It failed going South on the 30th of j
June by the engine being thrown from the track j f
(before daylight) by logs of wood which soine
malicious demon had laid across the road.? '
\Jtfem. Death should be inflicted for this
crime, if abolished for all others.] the Mail I
failed coming North on the 6th of June, by a f
wheel of the baggage car getting loose. It
failed on the 19th ult. coming North, in con.
sequence of waiting at Garey's Ferry one hour
after the schedule time, the traiu from WiL
mington not being up.
Such are a few of the occurrences on the ' !
great lines, often not generally known.

Cast Iron Churches. i
St. George's Church, Liverpool, says the j j
London Mechanics Magaxine in an object j C
of considerable interest tor its taste, and as : f
having been nearly the first iron church erect- (
ed in Great Britain. '
The whole of the frame work of the win- | J
dows, doors, groins, roofs, pulpit, and orna- ! 1
mental enrichrneuts, are of cast iron. The
length is 119 feet, the breadth 47. It is cr. j
namented by a splendid cast iron window of
stained glass. - j
It is not parbaps, generally known that a j j
great proportion of tint larger manufactories ; j
i-rected in England within the last ten years, j j
are all.iron except the walla. And within , j
two year* past, several cottages and country j
villas have bfceri put up near London, which 1
are exclusively ca*t iron: walls, doorsteps, . I
roof, chimney, sash, &c. J
England, where wood is dear and iron 11
cheap, tlfc drat cost of such buildings is less I *
than those of timber. In durability and ia *
beauty, they are ofconrse unequalled. When
once finished such buildings require no re. ^
pairs: and the most finely carved ornaments
cost little more than plain castings.
Steam Bkidoe.?The St. Louis Argus
describes the following: * A striking use r
of the steam engine lias been adopted at i
Portsmouth, Missouri. It is a floating i
bridge, seventy feet long, and sixty feet *
wide, impelled by two engines of twenty." J
horse power, and making tho passage (
(2,200 feet) at the speed of about 350 (
feet a minute. The bridge drafts, with 1
all its ma'ehinery, but two feet. This j
capital invention will naturally supersede (
the awkward contrivances of bridg s of /
boats on the great European rivers, and 1
will not improbably obviate the formida. (
ble expense of building bridges, and, must .
greatly facilitate communication in col.
onies and new settlements in every part
of the world." 1
TIGHT LACKING. j
A physician in Albany, New York, |
says, " We read last week a heart-sicken- i
ing account of the decease of a fine and '
amiable young lady who fell a victim to .
fashion?she laced herself to death! A- ,
part from the prevailing infatuation which
leads females to commit elegant and refined
suicide, she is said to have been an I
uncommonly intelligent and promising j
girl. The body presented a dreadful t
sight. The ribs were contracted to with- ?
in half their natural circumference, and j
the shoulder blades were actually lapped t
over each other! The chest was of course
J- ? .
extremely narrow, and not half the natural
room was left for the action of the
-1 * v. a 1. aL. I ?
heart, and the inspiraion 01 air inio me
lungs. * The consequence was death."
(
FEROCIOUS ATTACK ON A MAN BY A HORSE, j
Ao unprecedented instance of ferocity >
in a horse was witnessed a few days ago v
in the commune of Wilryck. A man
named Dogroof was employed in plough* ?
ing a piece of land ; his horse becoming 7
restive, the ploughman endeavored to 4
force obedience by blows, when (he vicious
animal turned upon his master and
attacked him.witli such obstinate severity,
that, though a man of uncommon
strength, be was speedily thrown on the
earth, after having sustained some very ^
frightful iujusies ; his face covered with
wounds from the bites inflicted by the ra* 0
hid animal, and his hands bruised in a
n ? ' .1 I
tno^t shocking manner. aorarirom me
mimuls fury being diminished by
having got the better of hia victim, his
rage redoubled. The cries of the unlorlunate
man at legnth brought some per. son
to hia rescue, when they found the
horse trampling him under his hoofs. In
astate of extreme suffering with two o
his ribs broken, and his whole frame cov- 1
with wounds and hraises, death put an

CHEAT TUNNEL. . d,
We aregratined at being able to state tt
that ?the operations on the graduation of
the Baltimore ar^d Ohio Railroad, between ra
Harper's Ferry and Cumberland, are already
so far advanced as to warrant its d
sorppletion in the course of the ensuing *'
year. " 91
Dnrincr the last month, the tunnel at the
Doe Gully .notch.(which at one time was j
iupposed to present the greatest obstacle j

Opened from end to end so thoroughly as
to allow a carriage to be driven through ^
it. This tunnel (which is twelve hundred ^
feet long and excacatrd in ihe solid rock q

little more than twelve months, by the ^
men working night and day. We learn *
