During the last session of Congress the
w idow of Harmon Biannerhassctt petitioned
for indemnity, for losses incurred by her j
late husband, in conscience of tfie des- j
truction of his property by an armed force,
during the cxcitcinpnt growing out of j
four's conspiracy, while the petition was

died at New York, at the age of 70. Sne
was very poor; having beer, for many
years supported by a warm-hearted countryman.
Hor extraordinary beauty and
- accomplishments have been rendered faHy
Wirt's eloquent description,
jm his defence of her husband. He represented
her as "beautiful as a flouri, and
gifted as Zoh^ide."
Her husband, a wealthy Irish emigrant,
shared the political opinions of Robert
Emmet, and is said to have left Ireland to
avoid his fate. He bought an estate on
Bacchus Island, in the broad Ohio, on
which he expended $55,000. It became
rcnouned for the elegance of the mansion,
the tasteful arrangement of the grounds,
and the loveliness of the scenery. It was
described as n luxurious retreat, which
and her Nymphs might have

place are now remaining. In an evil hour,

ded on that beautiful Island, and sent his

sei'Vhni with the following note:
" Colonel Burr solicits the favor of being
permitted to icandcj^qmong the grounds
of Mrs. Blaunerhassot.
\ This, of course, received a courteous
answer, and the acquaintance thus begun
involved the hospitable emigrant, in the
treasonable designs of his insidious guest.

following account, from the LickpilWallev
Register, Kentucky, is given
who knew thein in their prosperity :
Much has been said and written on the
^ conspiracy of Aaron Burr; and a diversity
of opinion still exists, as to the extent
of his designs. The elegant retirement
of Blanncrhasset, previous to his association
with Burr, has also been a theme of

Burr met in council with a fragment of
his followers, on an island in the Mississippi,
where his scheme was abandoned. ! j
lie fled in disguise but was arrested, tried s|
at the cilv of Richmond, and acquitted by ' ai
a quirk of the law. Blunnerhns.sett and j
other associates were discharged. His I
family, servants and furniture, having descended
the river to Natchez, he located
himself pn a cotton farm in that vicinity, ..
The embargo and the war which follow- I
ed, defeated his expectations; he became w
embarrassed; his fortune having been b?
impaired by his liabilities for Burr. Under
the prospect of a civil appointment in
Lower Canada, he removed to Montreal,
but his friend, the governor, being rcmoved,
he was again disappointed, and retired rc
at lust to the Island of Jersey, in the Brit- :ti
ish channel, where his maiden sister resi- tr
ded, a lady of fortune. There he died the ^
victim of a romantic and visionary mind. ^
Blunncrhasselt was an Irish nobleman, s
a man of science, and a polished gentleman.
He excelled in the composition
and performance of music; his instruments
were the violin, and bass-viol, both
of which he used in the manner of the S
bass; His spacious hall was constructed ^
in musical proportions, where the tones of
his viol vibrated with thrilling effect. His
library As elegant and extensive, bis laboratory
was provided with abundant ap- 7
parntus for chemical and philosophical ex- d
perimcnts, and his house and gardens h
were furnished with various means of win- a
tcr and summer amusements. The man- jj
sion, with its corridor and wings, formed
half an ellipsis, and the finish and furni- ^
ture of its apartments were adapted to the a
use for which they were intended. The ti
hall was a spacious, lofty room, its walls b
painted a sombre color, and its furniture c
rich, heavy, and grand. The drawing ?
room whs in perfect contrast, and its dec- ^
orations light as a fary's wing. In short p
the whole establishment was noble and n
genteel, without the glare'of tinsel finery, n
innnncidlonru nf had taste. His a
I'l I 11 Is w.
stylo of living was in unision with his ll
house and furniture, always elegant, easy c
and comfortable. The arrangement of ^
the grounds was equally complete, the j
famous shrubery was a mimic wilderness, <?
with labyrinth walks bordered with flow, it
ers, and interspersed with arbors and
grottos. The extensive pastures in front,
with its flocks and herds, was separated
from the lawn by an invincible fence;
and the view upon the Ohio was obstructed
for several miles. But the whole "j
scene requires the pen of a poet. The J
description of Wirtds nearer the reality j
than is generally believed, and his sketch I of
Mrs. Blannerhassett is equally true to jt
nature. She was a beautiful, and accom- I '
plished lady, of dignified appearance and p
manners; affable, friendly, and without! .
lite least affectation, yet with all her cle?hc
was a noble housewife, and do- ^
voted to her needle; tioi ?? lite nroduc.- 1
(ion of flowers and flounces, but of garments
for her children and servants. /
t iiu mlofs wbi^h have been ^
reported of her, are without the least
foundation. Burr did not seduce Blan- ^
nerhassett, through the medium of his .
7 D /
wife, as has often been stated; his only
- "uit iu tiic i->lanu did not exceed three
days; and no woman of Mrs. Blannerhassett's
mind and character, couid be corrupted
on so brief an acquaintance. Blannerhassett
was an open and unguarded
man, easily imposed upon and enthusins- i]
tic in all his impulses. Burr approached t<
him in the most artful and insidious mar^
ner. Descending the river in a*batt^aux.
he landed as a passing siranger merely to J.
Spc and admire the fur-famed island. Sir.
Blannerhassett hearing that' a slranger ^
was on his sent a servant to invite fi
big) to the house; the wily serpent sent 1
his card with an apology, but Mr Blanner- 1
hassett with his usual hospitality walked
out and insisted on his ?remaining a day f
or two. Burr very modestly acquiesced, and
during that uijfortunato interview, b
infused the poison of ambition into the C
unwary mind of his visionary host. Mrs.
Blannerhassett endeavoured to dissuade _
her husband from the enterprise, but findhis
soul enlisted in it, her sense of duty 7
compelled her to acquiesce in his views,
which resulted in the ruin of his family. ^
" Years have gone by, and the talc at last, ft
Is told as a sorrowful scene long past."
The steamboat passenger looks on the V
deserted island for some vestageof its for- l!
it
mer embelishment; but he looks in vain.
The mansion was destroyed by fire, its
beautiful appendages are blitcratcd, its
hospitality, the soul of music and the refinement
of taste and intellect have all departed*
On nfty Inst visit to the scene of
many happy hours, the only memento of my
early associations l^ould find, was : J
* R. \V. 1805," carved on the bark ofan J
old beech tree.

The demand for this work is unprecedented,
and orders are pouring in from all parts of the
I United States. It is called "A Christian Father's
Present to his Family," and has received
the unqualified recommendation of all tho
leading papers, both political and religious. No
mere advertisement, however, can give the reader
any idea of its beauty and value?it must be
seen to be admired, and read to be duly appreciated.
The annexed extracts from the '* Opinions
of the Public Prestfy will satisfy all of the ialrin
sic excellence of this Splendid Gem in Modern
Literature?tho like of which has never appear
ed in this or any other country. A careful perusal
of the following " Recommendations" will
justify usi n making use of such strong language
in favor of so useful a work : m
"A work of great attraction and value. This _
volume must find a welcome at every fireside ? fl
throughout the country: its con'enl* are as in?jr \1
tercsting as they arc important and instructive; & it
and tiie judicious and talented author has here
contrived to present us with one of the most attractive,
and at the same time useful books, that
have apfeared this side of the Atlantic. We *1
trust the public will reWard its enterprising publisher."?U.
S. Literary Advertiser, for 'Jams,
1842.
** This volume, we should say, well deserree
to be regarded as the 'Christian Father's present
to his family.' Several hundred very good woodengravings
enliven its narratives, and il'ustratJB
its solemn truths to the understanding and
ings of the young; nnd from the numerous testimonies
which accompany the volume, we should
say, it may safely be surrendered to their bands.**
?Magnolia.
' This work is an attractive one, not only for
the very numerous neat embellishments which
pervade it, but from the interesting and useful
matter which it comprises. This work is in large
octavo, highly decorated, and handsomely bound,
and will no doubt meet with a popular demand."
