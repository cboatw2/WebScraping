In the letterof Gen. Harrison to Mr. Ly
ons, which we published a week or two
ago, allusion is made of a letter written
by the General to the whig meinbers of
the New York Legislature. The Har
rison papers asserted liat.this letter would
put at rest all doubts in regard to General
Harrison's principles and opinions of the
principal topics of the day. As the letter
-was not forthcomin,the democratic press
eq called loudly for the publicaion of it.
The delay in publishing it appeared omi
nous. At-last it has niade,iis appearance
in the New York Courier & Enquirer.
Here is the letter, without a word of com
ment from us. If new light has been
throwh on the opinions -f Gen. Harrison,
we must confess that out optics are so dull
that we could not perceive it; perhaps
some of our readers may be more fortunate
than we are.-Augusta Constitutionalist.
NoaaT BEND, (Ohio,) May 23, 1840.
Gentlemen-I have -he hinor to ac
knowledge the receipt of your letter of the
25th February, conveying the proceedings
of a meeting of the Whig members of the
Legislature, convened in the Capitol of
the State, on the 2-2d of that month.
I beg you to believe, Gentlemen, that
I am deeply impressed u ith the honor,
which has been conferred upon we by the
distinguished body, whom on this occasion
you represent. The great object of both
my civil and military life has been to serve
ny country, to the utmost of mv abilities,
and to obtain its approbation. The hope
of this has often cheered me in circun
stances of great difficulty and embarrass
ment.
You will pardon me I trust, if in, this
letter, I. go somewhat beyond the mere
purpose of acknowledging the receipt of
your communication, and use the occa
sion for making a few remarks, which
circumstances seem to require frotn me,in
respect to a declaration or opinions. or
pledges, as to my future conduct, required
of candidates for high offices.
My public life, not now a short one, is
before the country. My opinions on im
portant subjects, have been expressed
from titne to time, as those subjects have
arisen, and since my name has been men
tioned among those from whom a selection
might be maile for the office oflPre-ident.
I have iii several letters to friends, fully
end frankly avowed my sentiments.
Farthr from this, 1. cannot suppose intel
ligent persons could desire me to go.
Thi people of this country do not rely on
professious, promises. and pledges-they
know, that if a candidate- is unprincipled.
he will not scruple to give atdy pledge that
may be required of him and as little will
fe hesitate to violate it. I have already
made public the-principles by which I
should be governed, if elected President,
so far as relates to the proper Executive
duties ofthat office. But almost innumer
able applications have been made to ie,
for my opinions relative to matters of le
'gislation, or even to the proper node -of
conducting husinesq'in the two Houses of
Congress. My published letters to Mr.
ent branch oflegislature; yet it is imupossi
ble to-read the letters that have been ad
dressed to me, without believing that ma
ny of the writers had adopted the opinion,
that the Presidential office was the proper
source-and origin of all the legislatiotn of
the country; an opinion, in my judgment,
at war with every principle of the consti
tution; and of deep and daacerous conse
quence. The prevalence (if such setii
ments, more than almost any thing else,
would tend to consolidate the whole sub
stantial power of the Governm-nt in the
hands of a single man, a tendency which,
whether in or out of office, I feel it liy
most solemn duty to resikt.
I have declined therefore to give an y
further pledg~es or opinions on subjects
which belong to future legislation of Con
gress-becauise,
1st. 1 conceive, for the reasons given in
my letters to Mr. Williams and M r Den
ny, that Congress should be left as nmutch
as possible untrammelled by the execti
live influence in the discharge of its legisla
tive functions; and that a better etatrantee
for the correct conduct of a Chief Msagis
trate.tnay he founad in his character andl
the course of his former life, than in pledens
and opintions given during the petidency
of a doubtful contest; and that, although
recognizing the right of the people to he
informed of the leading political opinions
of the candidates for oflices oif trust, yet as
it regards the subjects upon which the Le
gislature may be called to act, the pledees
and opinions shoul.l be required, if requit -
ed at all, of the candidates for Congress.
2d. Because, the habit of considering
a single individual as the source fromz
which all the measures of governmet
should emanate, is degrading to a repubi
lie, and of the mfost datngerous tendency.
3d. Because, upon all the qutestion-t in
- regard to which under any circumstances,
it would he at all proper, fe* me to mtake an
swers, my sentiments have already been
fully and clearly given to the ptublic, in a
manner to entitle them to credence, as I
conceive that no honest matn would suaffer
his friend to publish documetnts in his
name which were not genuine, or contain
ing opinions wvhich lhe wvas not then willing
to endorse. Accept, gentlemetn, the as
surrance of high regard,

HARRISON'S SALVO.
Messrs. Editors:-[ send you an extract
from a speech delivered by John Randolph
agaitnst the adoption ofe new Constitution,
ilelivered in the Virginii convention, in
1&29, 30. He so good as to give it a place
in your paper. and we w% ill leave our Har
rieot friends to make the applieation
-You must give Governments time to oper
ate on the people. & give Ihe Ieolpa time to
become gradually assimilated to their. in
stitutions. Almost any thine is better than
this state of perpetual uncertainty. A
people may have the best form or Govern
ment-that the wit of man ever devised:
and yet, from its uncertainty alone, may,
in emect, live under the worst Government
in the world. Sir, how often inust I re
peat, that change is not reform. I am wil
ling that this new Constitution shall stand
as-long as it is possible for it to stand. and
that, believe ame, is a very short time.
Sir, it is vain to deny it. They may say
what they please about the old Constitu
tion-the defect is not there. It is not
in the form of the old edifice, neither in
the design nor the elevation : it iA in the
material-it is in the people of Virginia.
To my knowledge that poople are chan
ged from what they have been. The four
hundred man who went ont to David were
in debt. The partizatsofmCesar were in
debt. The fell6w-labnrers of Catalitte
were in debt And i defy you to shew nie a
desperately indebted people any where,
who can bear a regtlar sober Government.
I throw the challetige to all who hear me.
I say that the character of the good old
Virainia planter-the man who owned
from five to twenty slaves, or less. who
lived by hard work and who paid his debts,
is passed away. A new order of things is
come. The period has arrived of living
by one's wits-of living by cottractine
debts that one conuot pay-and above all,
oflivine by office-huntinz. Sir. what do
we see? Bankrupts-branded bankrupt
-giving great dinners-sending their chil
dren to the most expensiveschools-eiving
grand parties-andjust as well received as
any body in society."

I beg you to be asured. afflord me the great
cst pliasure to meet my friends inGeorgia, on
the iujeresting occasion referred to; but I an
compelled by the oblization ofollicial .duty, to
deny nyselfthat gratification.
You have. gentlemen. neither overrated the
influences with which I hare had to contend in
the administrtinn of the Goverenment, nior in
my judment, the relative importance of the
crisis which has arisen inl the general politics
of the country. It will undonbtedly require
the fullest exercise of the patriotism of the peo
ple, and an unshaken fidelity on the part of
their offiial agents to meet it successfully and
hov.orably. LDetermined to perform my whole
dnty itn the matter-tr !sting that my asocintes
will do likewise-anit'd having seen nothing in
rec..nt events to shake my habitual confidence
in the intelligence, integrity and firmness of
our countrymen, I do not allow myself to
donlt that all the obstacles, which have been
thrown in the way ofthe public serviee, will
bet speedily and sneocessfully overcome.
Beggiig you the favor to return tny unfeign

there were no other objections to his electiona,
the aidacitous nnil inintine position lie has
amusnmed of refusing to 'liselose his opinions to

the highest office inl their gift, and the uisgust
ing nutmerv of log cabin and beer barrels,
which would disgrace the orgies of the low

been heralded forth even by the highest of his

common country. But us a Southern man, I
have mich graver objections to him. He is
a National Republican. holding all the doc
trines aid principles of that party; he was
noiniiated bv that party, and will susain every
measure which may be proposed by its great
leadets. Mr. Webster nefer attered a consti
tutional doctrine. and M r. Clay never proposed
a measure that Geniral Harrison has not sup.
ported or approved. In fracthe will be a tool
in the hands oftese two gentlemen, and to
elect him, would be fo adopt theit principles
and neatsiures. If Sourthern statesmen are
prepared for this, I ent not believe the people
are. Having withdrawn entirely front the
field of politics. disguiste.l with the everlasting
scrambling for office which gives a party color

derstood. that while I am utterly orposed to the

MR. EDIToR:-InI proposiag to submit a few
remarks relative to the Governor's election. it
is not my object or wish to engage in a news
paper controversy with any gentleman. Bit
simply to exercise that right which every free
inan is entitled to ina republican governament.
viz: to express his opinion freely and unti am
rmeletl bv anv arbitrary or conventoaea restric
tion. What'other motive could ucinate me?
I have nothiia to gain by the Governor's elec
tion, let it terminate its it may. I am interested
only so far as I am a citizen of South Carolina.
and as such subject alike with the rest of tmy fel
low citizens, to the influence which the Gov
ernor's election mny excrcise upon the pros.
perity and well-being of the sa'ie.

ally acnuaintedand for neither one or them. dol
entertain greater partiality than the other.person.
ally and viewed in their social relations. But!
must lie permitted to say, that r-egarding them
as politiciart. I am not neutral. I prefer decid
edly, Col. Hammond to Col. Richardson. and
believe that he is better cnpacitated to discharge
the gubernatorial duties. than his worthy com.
petitor The reasons which have influenced
or dictat, d my choice ofGoernor. in my hum

basis oftrtth, and a just aprireciation of merit.

of candor, in--ennousness and disintere-ted pa
triotisn over the intri-rne. donble dealing, and
imachinations nfthe "spoils party." Bit not to
indulge in coniectures and mere assertions, and
to coie to the proor. The course which Col.
Hammonid and Col. Richardson pursued. and
theposition which they occnpied in 1832, when
clouds ol'darkness ov'erhung our political hori
zon, and threatened to burst upont us with all
their accunilted force and ftry, involving us
it one general and universal ruin I shall not
attempt to re'capitulate, as thr-y have been suffi
ciently dilated upon by otheiswlho have written
on the subject. .y~ notivet for wirkho'.ling
an expres-iton of opinion on this subject, are
not bee.iuse I regard the rirnggle of 1832, be
tween the old Union and Nullification parties, as
one of an unimportant nature. and that period
as in era sterile in strikiing events-nor because
I believe that the course which the leading men
of our State pursted at that momentous crisis,
is of no conseqietnce, and ps eintirely discon
nected with the subject of the guhrnatorial
election, and the clitimts necessary to recotutnend
a candidate to the important and responsible
station of Governor, as some would say, who
illaciously conien that it was provided in the
l-e ont et paiiet iUt' that
they should he nitued into tine undivided w hole.
I re:i-ain fron: dilating upon this pooint f'or the
reasons above asignedl, to wit:-that they
have been expatiated upon at stifficient lengtlh
by others. One, attd I beliqve, thie only argu
ment which the untiring and indelhtigab-e par
tizans of Lichardson have urged as t reason why
he should be preferred to Col. Ilaumond. is
that his election will afford a favorable oppor
tunity of cansine former animosities to be bu
ried, aid past differences to be adjusted, and
thus by establishina a spirit of' harmony, una
nimity, and good feeling amog the two parties,
-tt collect together the broke fragmemn s ol' our

us to sanme extent the same unpleasant feelings
we formerly had-which feeliugs no pattiut or
philanthropist in South Carolina can ever wish
to experience again. Dpes any one doubt
this ? What are the fitcls as they stand out in
bold relief ? Prior to the commencement of
this canvass, were we not 1ivine in peace and
amity; the most pierfect harmony and concord ?
Yet these very worthy and disinterested gentle
men would have you believe that we were in
cessttuly warring with each, and at dagaers
points. and that die very existence and well
heing of Sonth Carolina depended upon the is
sue na to whether or not a reconciliation was ef
fected, They futrthermore would feign have
you believe that to secure this great end and to
rescue South Carolina from the yawning gulf
over which she was pending-threatening her
destruction, you must elect Col. John P. Rich.
trdson. Indeed, he must be a man of great
poters-a second political Mesiah, sent from
heaven to bring about this happy result. Hav
ing briefly noticed the reasons urged in favor of
Col. Richardson, and made a few comments
upon them, I shall rather consider the objec
tion against Col. i nwn.tnl. than dwell upon
his claims directly. The Union, and some per
sons belonging totheNuollification party.say they
cannot vote for Col. Hammond What are
their reasons1 Hive they the hardihoodjo re
fuse to concede to hint ereat talents and amply
competent abilities to discharge the gubarnato
Tial offices? Dare they deny that Col. H's ca
reer in Congress, though a brief was a brilliant
one; and that the position he orcupied to
wards Sou'h Carolina during the heated times
of Nnllification, was not a high-minded. chival
rons, and magnanimous one I By no means.
What, then. are their objections to Col. 111
Why. forsooth, his supposed eoalition with the
Preston clique, 'Bank and Harrison party I
When did thezenlons partisansof Col. R make
this great discovery; and fromn what source did
they obtain this informntion I Can it be the
result of a mature deliberation based upon
facts; or is it the fancifil frahricaition of some
prolific imagination concocted for party effect?
Unquestionably the latter. Is it any-ways
strange and inexplicahle, that the friends of
Cdl Preston shoild prefer Col. H. to Col. R.;
and is it a logical conclusion to come to that,
because they do prefer him; that, therefore.
Col. H is identified.with the Preston and Har
rison party? Most assuredly not. Yet. u on
these very grounds, and no other, would ey
denounce Col. H. as a Preston and Harrison
man. The same persons have endeavured to
identify Mr. W hitfield Brooks with the same
party ;.and what is the pretext or excuse they
urge for so doing ? Why, A]Mr. B. is a ptersonal
friend of Col. Preston's, and both a personal
and political one of Col. Hammond. Trtly,
aocratic logic! But, let is examine it as to Col.
If., and see whether or iot lie is a Harrison
man-and wherefore he is smupported i.y the
Preston cliqe. lit 1832, the PreAton faction
coincided entirely with Col. H in the measures
that then agitated the State-they profi ssed the
sarie political creed, espoused the same cause,
ant fought under the same banner. They re
iniied together uitil 1837, when the Pritson
faction separated on the leading measures of
the admintistratiom, and went over to the Har
rison and Bank imrty. Col. H.. with his nus.
al consistency and known tenineity tou elilican
princiolesand S. Rights democratic doctrines
conatinued and still is theirfirm and inuflexi
ble supporter, uptwithstauding-nssertions have
been made to the contrary. Havinig briefly
noticed the relalion which the Preston faction
sustained to the Calhoun party of 1832 and of
the present tiy. I shall cast a bird's eye to the
relation it suistained to the Union party of
183-2, and also to the relation it bears to that
party at the present day. In 1'!32 the Preston
clique being the warm supporters of the doc
trine qr Nullification, were antipodes to the
Union p:.rty in feelings as well as in politics;
But, if any change has taken'place, they have
become more alienated. They are now as
they were then, enlisted under a different han.
ner, fight in different ranks, and for a different
catse-stich being and having been the rela
tive position of the several parties at the times
above alhded to-can it appear strange that
the Preslon faction, since they cannot elect a
man-of their own politics, that they should pre
fer Col. H. who is mnn-h less obtoxious to theni
than Col. Richardson? Why, then.these reek
less assertions an.d wanton accusations; why
this crusade against Col. H? After the explat

down the growing demon of selfishness; foil
those who labor to dupe the ignorant and crei.
ulous; and vindicate fearlessly, all attempts
and measures of a moral, patriotic, and benefi.

To this end. we wish every Candidate to
dash aside his msquerade. and, scorning to
conceal any sentiment 'of importance or con.
cern to his constituents, honorably irely for
success on his integrity and candor.
We are suspicious of those Candidates for
our Legislature, who hold at one and the same
time, two opposite and clashing opinions, or as
many more as there are parties. ,
It is true. these men seem to be very hind and
good creatures, as they are so obse .ens to all
whom they meet, but still, Mr. EdHor, I some
how or other, awfully fear these people. . The
smile on the-face looks insidious. They love,
and love ardently; but not me, not you, but
self; this is, their Idol and their God. The
canker around their hearts never can beget
pure, equitable, arid virtuous laws.
And sir, I, together with iany 7thers, re
gret exceedingly to see a legislator of ohrs for
the last term, receding from the field One,too,
the most remarkable for his prof'undjudgment
and strength or mind. and also, for his acquire.
ments, to which is added the sternest and most
undoubted integrity! And why not out? I
blush to make the answer of runmor-"Fear of
defeat." Will the intelligent and virtuous class
of the citizens of Edgefield District permit this?
I, sir, will plight the unanimous influence
and support of this class; and this task will be
the more easy. and voluntary, since at the en
suing session of the Legislature, we anticipate
a cntest between the low and up country.
But to each of those who are before us for
the high and responsible function of a Legisla
tor, I would say, let him show himself to be a
man ; a main. sir. worthy the name of a Caroli
nian. Let him give his earnest and unyielding
support to any and every measure, which be
honestly and candidly believes will tend to mo
rnlize, civilize, economize, and frugalize his
constituents. how unpopular soever such a
measure may be; for, in such a case, he would
be guided by the dictates of disinterested pat
riotism-the dictates of the noblest and most
dignified principles belonging to man. Such
a man has nothing to fenr!
The dishonest, inriguing, and deception
over the "comitatus vulgus' by his opponents,
may hecnnd his path and his prospects for a
seaSon; bnckbitinp, evil speakings. false re
ports and cahumny of every kip ' may war
against him; but under the blessings of Provi.
dence through the hands of his disinterested and
patriotic friends, (their vigilance and active ex
erti)ns operating in his behalf) he would rise
from the orleal with r bright and a moral hon
orable name, and with greatly increased
strength to do battle for his country. Such a
Candidate. I promise the vote and influence of

EDGEFIELD C. H
TnURSDAY. JULr 16, 1840.
We defer our remarks on the communicatioa
paper, unmil next week, for % ant of room.
To Correspondens.-We must again request
Correspondents, to hand in their communica
tions as early as p'esaible. Hereafter, we will
insert no communication which is offered, after
12 o'clock on Monday. Our paper is put to -
press on Wednesday, and it is absolutely neces
sary, that articles intended for immediate pub
lication, ahould be handed to us early on Mon
day, or before.
Adjournment of Congress.-Bnth Houses
have fixed upon the 21st inst., as the day for
adjournmnut.
We have received another communication
front " E Pluribus Unum." The writer com
imences with great professions of good feeling
towards us, for our generosity ini oliening our
paper to our Whig correspondents. For theis
we thank him. Ibut as lie proceeds, he departs
from his courteous tone. Hie ceases to address
uss, but addinesses some other person, whom he
styles a "Conmentator" on his remark, a "Pol
-itical leader" aid an "H onorable gentleman"
and who he snpposes wrote under the editorial
head, the criticism upon his communication.
This is disrespectful to say the least, to as, the
conductors of a public journal. In other re.
peets, the article of "E Pluribus Ununm" is
highly objectionable. The writer speaks rath
er too freely, of the want of "great political
knowledge or profound statesmatnship,"ofa" Pe
litical leader,'' as he calls the supposed author
of the editorial above mentioned. The entire
article of our correspondent departs so widely,
from the rules which govein newspaper writers,
thar we must delirli giving it publication. But
we repeat; that we will publish any communi
cation, which is decorous in language, and re
spectful to us.
Gen. McDuffie's Leter.-Our readers will
find' in the acount of ther Proceedings of the
Democratic, Rep'ublican party which recently
assembled .at Milledgeville, Ga, the reply of
General Mcluffie, to it letter addressed him by4
a committee of thme citizens of Baldwin county,
tendering him anm invitation to a dinner on
the Fourth of July at Milledgeville. The let
ter is open apd decided, and is perfe'ctly char
acteristic of its author. General McDuffie ex
presses briefly, but very pointedly and forcibly,
his objections to General Harrison. and his
party. He says with perfect truth, that Har
rison will be a tool in the hands of Webster and
Clay, andf to elect him, would be to adopt their
principles and mensures. Let Southern Whigs
igravely ponder upon this !Are they willing to
supiport the candidate of the National Republic
ans--a party which has ever beau hostile to
the South-ever alien in priniciple amnd feeling?
[n the concluisioni of his letter. General Me Duf
lie says "the principles hie(Mr. Van Buren) has
not only avowed but maintained openly, and
6rmly, are dear to the South.and what is equal
ly im portant, they are the principles of hisparty."
We have received from the Hon. John C.
Calhoun. a copy oef his speech" On the Bank
rup't bill." We will endeavor at a future time,
to pubtish it.
