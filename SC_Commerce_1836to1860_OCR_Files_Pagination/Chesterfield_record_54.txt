NORTH CAROLINA AND THE RAIL ROAD.
My attention lias just been called to an
Editorial ar iole under the above head in the
Carolina Gazettee, published at Rutherfordton,
North Carolina, on the 29th Sept.?
That article is evidendy written upon the
.authority of a member of the North Carol!
na Legislature, and requires a few words
from me. The statement is as follows, j
"A week or two since, we stated, that j
the South Carolina commissioners, who
were in a tendance in Ralegh, last winter, j
jand who procured the passage of the char- j
ter, authorizing the construction of a Rail I
Road, from Charleston to Cincinnati, induced
the belief upon the minds of many
members of the Legislature that the Road
would certainly enter North Carolina as .'ar
East as Broad River. We know it to be
a fact that a member of the Legislature pro- j
posed iutmdming an amendment to that
eilect, but was dissuaded by assurances j
1 Voln the commissioners, that there was no
doubt but that it would be located on that
route and that the amendment might perhaps
cramp, in some decree, the operations
of the Company. This being the state of i
facts, wo-cannot persuade ourselves, tliat |
our South C ir<i'in i brethren, who have ever ;
been distinguished for their high sense of!
honor, will consent that it should be located ;
on any other rout<\
At a meeting of the Joint Committee of
the citizens of C.mrlcston and Columbia, i
bold in Columbia during the Session of the
Legislature in December last I was rcques- j
t?.d to attend the North Carolina Legislature,
then in session, to give such information
and assistance as might be desired to !
procure the passage of the Charter of the \
projected Rail Roaii from Charleston to !
Cincinnati, Being an officer in attendance '
upon the Legislature, the ;KTinission of that;
body was necessary. It was given by a I
joint Resolution, and so far and no farther,!
could I be considered as representing the
State of South Carolina as a Commissioner.
Before my d?-parture for Raleigh. Col's.
G idsden and Brisbane, and Maj. Holmes,
'returned to Columbia from their reconnoisunco.
It wis considered important that as
much informa'ion as possible should be laid
liefbru the North Carolina Legislature, and
Col. Gads-Jen was prevailed on to accompauy
me.
On our arrival at Raleigh, we found the '
charter.as oasst d bv South Carolina already
I before
the Legislature, having had two !
readings in the Senate, where some altera- j
tions, reserving irnjmrtant privileges 10 ynrth
Carolina. were under consideration. The ,
host and most liberal spirit prevailed towards
tin* great work; hat tie reservations alluded
to were eventually at the 3rd reading inserted
in tin; Senate. At our returns', and upon
oar representing that South Carolina had '
reserved none for herself, and upon our j
throwing ourselves upon the libera! feelings
of our sister State, that vote was reconsidered,
ami the privileges reserved to North
Carolina were struck out by a vote of 4 to
1, at least.
The Dill then went into the IIousc of
Commons. Maj. Jainc# Mc I). Carson,!
called upon us and asked if wc would object
to his ottering a clause requiring the loca-!
lion of the road as far Kast as the Broad
River, and sta'cd he had prepared or would
prapare such a clause, if we did not think it
would prejudice the undertaking. Col. '
(rudsden replied that from the report made
by Col. Brisbane, he had no doubt, profies- '
vikimtlv/ <ar?,?:?tf inrr. that tin* road UlUSt be a>
0?V?"V*. J -J' - -
Cated as tar oast as tho llroad River, and .
jliat although he thought it won! I be better
not to introduce such a clause, he believed
the charter would be accepted with it. I i
assented entirely T<> what Hoi. (Tulsden said j
;ln I Muj. Cirson ivplie I, that under these '
circumstance's, he would not press the j
amendment. He never ottered it?nor was 1
1 lien; from any gentleman of the House of:
(Vmmons, tiie slightest attempt made to im- '
pedo the charter, embarrass the scheme, or
to insert any condition. The mo.'t liberal i
leeling prevailed, and the charter was expedited
and passed unanimously.
North Carolina has on all occasions when
called to act on tliis snbioc\ acted with the j
most disinterested liheraiitv-sho lias reserved
no privileges and exacted no terms.? '
For one, I have always considered that her
conduct has put us under stronger obliga- :
lions not to abandon her, than if she had extorted
terms and conditions at our hand.

The following picture of affairs in Mexi- i
co, drawn by a correspondent of the Phila-1
dclpliiu Gazette, exhibits a most dreadful)
state of things in that Republic, if such it i
muv be culi'd. Tiie statements appear al- ;
most incredible ; and judging from the most 1
accounts we have before seen of Mexico, j
we should be disjtoscd to consider some of
the circuuis'ances mentioned by tlie gentle. ,
man as incidental, rather than general. But
no doubt can exist that Mexico groans under
the domination of tyrants?and many j
of whom, are nominal minis ers of God?
the most hellish of all tyrants.
City of Mexico, July 15,193C. j
Dear Sir :?
" I am about to detail to you some things !
which 1 have seen in the republic of Mexico.
1 have seen 40 squads of 300 men each
impressed against their own protes:ations, |
and those of their wives and children, inlo :
tha armed service of fha connfry.
I have seen 000 men chained, with not a
rag on to hide their nakedness, up to their
middle in the common sewers ot the city,
guarded hy halt* as tnanv soldiers, who, besides
their arms carried large switches with
which they unmercifully lushed the poor
prisoners, if perchance they should shrink
from or hesitate to plunge into a vile collection
oi' the vilest tilth.
1 have seen a bayonet presented to the
breast of a man for refusing to kneel in the
streets when the Host was passing.
| I have seen a man stoned for neglecting
to doff his hat when before the image of the
{ \ irgin, or sain'.
I have seen a man conveyed 300 miles
! to be incarcera.cJ, lor having written and
! published his honest opinions contrary to
! those of the general belief that Don Antonio
I Lopez San hi Anil was just an good and
I great.
1 have seen a forced loan levied virtually
on foreigners alone, without any prospect of
I repayment, to the amount of two millions
of dollars.
I have scon more than one hundred
corpses interred in spots uiong the Darmina
Del Ruy, where as many persons have been
slain by brigands, or robbers.
I have seen a general depository f?r the
bodies of all persons assassinated in the cap
ital. It it is here understood that the average
daily number throughout the year is
fire, making 1823 murders committed in
this one city, in the course of 12 months,
(an.I this coun'ry is called a republic !)
I have seen doors of private citizens, and
of public officers, and of the national assemblv,
guarded by bodies of armed men. Vet
ibis is called a republic!
j' I have never seen a ranehero who was
not armed with a sword, pistols and a lasso.
I have rarely seen a gentleman who did
not ride with !.ulsters at the pummel of his
saddle. They a!!, without exception, go
secretly armed.
I have heard threats against foreigners
proclaimed in the streets, and oaths taken
that they should die the death of dogs and
i heretics.
1 myself have been twice threatened, and
tlie promises of vengeance tire the only
promises which these people keep.
1 have not slept without pistols under
my pillow, nor gone into the streets without
being armed to the teeth. We are obliged
to keep a guard at the door night and day.
Last week the city of Oajaco was set lipon
by about 100 of these men?they succeeded
in forcing an entrance, sacked the
citv, killed the foreigners, violated the
nuns, an'1 set themselves down to a mcrrv
feasting drawn from die cedars of the wealthy.
The libera! party of this country have
an immense majority of the people on their
sid'\ but have heretofore been prevented
from making any military movement for
want of arms. The arms arc however in
the coun'rv ; and as the old general said in
speaking of the Irish under under similar
circumstances, let the people take them.
The flra'l alive.?An old officer on the
retired list, living at Santes, in the Cliarcr.tc
Inforicure, a few days ago fell into a lethargy,
and was buried with military honors, under
the conviction that life was extinct; but
awakened by the firing of the platoon over
his grave, which took piace before the coffin
was covered with earth, lie made himself
heard by his cries, was taken out, and walked
home arm in arm wiih those who had
Ixdieved tlit y had taken their best farewell of
liiin.
FRANCF.
The French papers announce the formation
of a now cabinet, which is thus stated :
Count Molo, minister for foreign affairs and
president of the council.
M. Cmizot, minister for public instruction.
M. Gisparin, minister of the interior.
M. Porsil, minister of justice.
M. Durhatel, minister of commerce.
Admiral Rosamel, minister of marine.
Marshal Monitor Molitor, minister of war.
Ry tins arrangement it will be seen thattlie
docfrinaries arc again in power, and we shall
not be at all surprised to hear, before long, that
the Duke do Brofifliw is reinstated as president
of the council and foreign minister. We have
long been of opinion that none but a doctrinaire
ministry could stand, and that of such a ministry
the I)ukc do llroglie must be the head.
Ti:e King'has more confidence in him than in
any other man.
Count D'Argout resumes his former post as
governor of the bank.
The Paris papers and letter* written in that
capital teem with rumors of plots mid conspiracies.
SPAIN.
Madrid papers to the tllst of August had
been received i:i London. No more disturbances
had taken place up to that date.

faithfnl and sincere adherence to the Constitution
of 1812, but announcinir that the said Constitution
will be revised and amended by the
Cortes, to be assembled for that purpose on the
21th of October.
A forced loan of 200 millions of reals has
been ordered.
(Jen. Mina was so very ill that his life was
considered in extreme danger.
On the whole, the aspect of affair.- is rather
favorable to the Queen. Don Carlos was
very much in want of money, and urJess the
ultra liberal spirit, which is now triumphant in
Spain, is carried in the excess of revolution, it
is probable that the civil war will soon be
brought to a termination. The Constitution
of 1812 is more formidable than an army to
Don Carlos.

Tlie number of shares subscribed in tiiis j
town to the Cincinnati and Charleston Rail j
road was 200.
In Charleston very great anxiety prevailed
last week on account of the steamer William j
Gibbons having left New York for that city I
with passengers to the number of 200, and j
I uot arriving lor a number of days after she was :
expected. She went on shore at New Inlet
between 20 and 110 miles north of Cape llat- ;
teras on the coast of North Carolina, on the j
i 10th and all the passengers were saved. The j
i boat was abandoned as a total wreck. The i
j account which we have seen does not state j
i whether it was by a gale or not that she was I
I driven ashore.
| INTERNAL IMPROVEMENT CONVENTION IX SALISBURY

' other rail road or navigable stream cornmun'- '
1

indian war.
Jacksonville, Oct. 13.
We hear, partly from rumor but mostly ,
from undoubted authority, that the detachment
of Tennessee troops have killed straggling In
dians to the number of fourteen. It is to be
hoped that the report and general impression
are true?that even the swamps and hammocks
of Florida afford no rate refuge for the
Indian, from the bold and brave Tennesseeans.
The question of command between Gen.
Jesup and Gov. Call is settled. Gen. Jesup
docs not claim it, but offers to take any coi#
inand the Governor will give him. The Governor
gives him the command of his own regulars.800
in number, and the Creek Indians, 000
in number. They left Tampa on the 23th ult.
and are supposed to be on the Outhlachuchy.
Military.?\Vc have good reason to believe
that General Gaines has been recalled from
his command in Texas, and that Col. Arbuckle
will succeed him as long as our troops remain
there. It is probable, however, they
will be ordered info winter quarters somewhere
iu our own undisputed territory.

Presentation at Court.?We perceive by the
London Morning Chronicle, among the presentations
at his Majesty's late levee, was Mr. '
Charles II. Delavan, of New York, by the
American Minister. Talk of aristocracy and
royalty after this; we deny it in toto; tiie British
Court and the British King are more orthodox
and democratic than we are at Tammany.
llere is our worthy fellow-citizen, Mr.
Delavan, the son of a patriot of the Revolution j
(the late General Delavan,) who sells the best
hardware in the city, keeps the very neatest
assortment' of balanced handled knives and
forks, plated ware and scuttles, and is, withal i
a line looking fellow, walks into Court with all !
the flower of nobility, foreigners and field mar- i
shals, and makes as good a ligure as any of j
the assemblage. After tJiis, we are quite cer- i
tain that his store at the corner of Broom street |
and Broadway will be thronged with the car- j
riages of our nobility, gentry, and fashion.
REMARKS BY TIIE NEW YORK EXPRESS.
Mr. Vail, our Secretary of Legation, once i
received a pretty broad hint, that he presented
too many Americans at Court. Mr. Steven. J
son is green yet. His eves will stare by and ;
bv. If the English courtiers should know j
that a New York hardware merchant was [
;it Court. ;iil the lords and ladies of !
the household would bo in his hair. "AnAmeri-'
can citizen" is pass enough in the Tuilleries, )
but at St. James or Windsor, a man must
have a long-tailed title to his name. Many
of our Yankee boys have a little office, and
pass for a General or so. A General is a mighty
big man in Europe, though many of them here
much resemble, when in their " military splendor,"
the rich liveried lacqueys that ride be- 1
hind a Duke or Dutchess's carriage as it goes
into the court yard of the Palace. John Dull
is very much puzzled what to do with brother ;
Jonathan, when Jonathan goes over sea. Other
people from the Continent have a title to 1
their names, and a title is introduction enough;
but we Jonathans, half of us at least, cannot ]
for the life of us tell who our great-grandfathers
were. Mr. Van Bnren it is said, when in
England, claimed to be of the Kinderhook 1
t a mili/. Mr. Wilkins, we have been told,
when on his return from Russia, was entertained
with a magniffcent dinner at Windsor,
sitting high among Dutchesses, with the Prin- 1
cess Victoria and all. They, it is said, questioned
him closely about our families and rank.
We have all the story, but. we don't like to
put it in print. The anecdotes, however, were
biquant, and Mr. Wilkins amused and interested
his royal entertainers very much. John
Bull, we Yankees have the advantage of you
in point of rank. Wc are all noble born here
?all of the royal blood. Dukes and Lords, and
Counts, and all that by patent right. If Barney
O'Blannagan or Teddy O'Rourke will .
emigrate here, we will give him a nobility paT~

20th September 18130, Mrs. Hannah Shovel, ;
aged 100 years. She was the mother of ele- , i
ven children, when her husband died in 177G. j j
Her maiden name was Hannah Smith. It is ! c
not recollected that she ever was a member of \
any church, but was pious, moral, honest and j.
upright in all her dealings; always cheerful and 1
fnsfinntinrr in her discourse to her acouaint- n
ances. In July last, she spun on the little j a
wheel six cuts of thread in one day. She re- :
tained her perfect sense till about the 10th of I 5
September, when she was taken with chills !
and high fevers, and they continued to increase r
in severity until she died. She walked briskly
and lively, with . it assistance, until the day
she died. She lived on coarse, strong diet, : ^
which was always "her choice. She never was j p
fond of cotlee or tea. She stated she had been j jy
accustomed to constant, hard domestic labor ; a
all her life; also that she had been in the habit
of drinking spirits all her life, in moderation. jv
I saw her in June, and thought she was not l
more than sixty, until she began to tell me her Q,
age. She walked perfectly erect; her speech g
was easy and^tree; her memory perfect and
sound ; lor she related things that had taken v
place but a few weeks before, and some things $
that had occurred a number of years before. I |
would challenge all the States in the Union to 0
show us her equal.?Raleigh Star. j
