Samuel Governuer Esq., Son-in-law o
the late ex-President Monroe is preparing
the press a biography of Mr. Monroe.
At the second annual exhibition of a Agri.
cultural Society at Washington, near Natchez
Mississippi, last Spring, one thousand persona
were present, nearly one third of whom were
Udjct.
The Bank Bill.
All parties watch with solicitude the
progress of this bill in Congress. Its fate
seems still doubtful. In the Senate,
since the branch question has been decided,
the Whigs have voted together on all
questions involving important features of
the bill, and their majority has been from
4 to 6. It is supposed however that on
its final passage in its present form, Mr.
Rives and one or two other Whigs will
vote against it; but the general opinion
seems to be that it will pass. In the
House of Representatives although there
are Whigs who prefer the plan recom.
mended by the Secretary of the Treasury,
and others, as in the Senate, who
though they prefer the present bill, will
yet vote for the Secretary's plan as a compromise,
still if the anti- Whigs oppose
this plan as they did in the Senate, it cannot
succeed. In that case there eeems
to be little doubt that the bill will pass the
House. If it should, will the President
sign it ? The language of his address to
the people of the United States at the
time of entering upon the duties of the
Presidency gave rise to r, very general
expectation that his mind was made up to
*ign such a bill; but the more cautious
* language of his message to Congress at
the opening of fne session again threw
doubt upon the course which he seemed
willing to let the country know he had
marked out for himself. It is believed by
many that the Secretary of the Treasury's
plan was adopted bv that officer only in
dofercnce to the ascertained opinion of
the President; and this would seem to be
probable from the fact that the Secretary
himself has no sc~uplcs about the power
of Congress to incorporate a bank with
branches in the States. It is also supposed
that the earnest support given by
Mr. Choate, Senator from Massachusetts,
to this anomalous plan, is to be ascribed
to intimations from his friend the Secretary
of State that the President had let
his cabinet know he could not approve a
bill giving power to place branches in the
ntates without their consent.
On the other hand the President has
uniformly maintained the character of a
hiffhminded and honorable man, and it is
contended l>y the Whig9 that although
he was not questioned as Gen. Harrison
was, before the election as to his opinions,
yet the fact of his accepting a nomination
as the candidate for the Vice Presidency,
on the Whig ticket, and the active pari
which he continued publicly to take in
their ranks tilt the very time of the electian,
bind him as strictly in honor and
* good faith to carry out the principles
and leading measures of the party as if hf
had in'the strongest language expressly
pledged himself to do so. On this poinl
there can, indeed, be no question anion"
honorable men. It would certainly have
been most disingenuous nnd dishonorable
in Mr. Tyler to accept the nomination il
he dissented on materia! points from the
known opinions of the party which nominated
him. Was, then, a national hank
such in its prominent features as
the country had previously tried, a
Whig measure, and one of those on
which the election turned? The great
body of the Whigs, 'in every state which
voted for Mr. Tyler, we believe, say it
was; but Mr. Tyler, in his message at the
opening of Congress sajs it was not. He
avs however in the same document

ment of the American people on thi:
whole subject I have no accurate mean*
of determining, but by appealing to thei
immediate representatives." And again
'To you, then, who have come more di
rectly from the body of our common con
stituents, I submit the entire question, a;
heat qualified to give a full exposition o
their wishes and opinions." If this 44 ex
position" should be such as to call upoi
the President for a fulfilment in good faitl
of an implied pledge to sign an old fash
ioned national bank, whether he will re
cognise the legitimacy of the call and hi
obligation to obey it, is positively known
we suppose, to very few. If he should vet
the Senate's bill, will the Whigs retrca
from their ground and adopt the anomalou
scheme of the Secretary of the Treasury
Some of them will; but whether or not,
sufficient number will *do so to carr
through the measure, there is now n
means of forming e\ en a probable conjee
tare.

The MiiTBopuLirxa .Rxilroad* v
The report of the President of the Raleigh b
,nd Gaston Railroad to the company at the g
.nnual meeting in May, given quite a favora- o
tie account of the affairs and prospects of c
he company. On thet subject ot continuing
he road to Columbia the President writes as
allows:
Si
44 ft is known to most of you, that when
he Raleigh and Gaston Road was originally 11
il inned, it was intended to form one of the a
inks in the great chain of inland communica- f
ion from North to South, and that an exten- p
ion of the Road to Columbia in South C'aro* j(
ina, was at the succeeding Session of the .
jegislature authorized, and a Charter obtain*
d for that purpose. The great revulsion in U
he business operations and monetary affairs g
f the country, which occured almost imniedi- a
fely after the granting cf th* Charter for
he Road to Columbia,-prevented any further l|
rosecu tion of that object than inere'y to se
ure the Uharter. wuicn requireu * given u
mount of the Stock to be subscribed within e
specified time, and the actual commence. L
uent of the work. The vast importance of
his Road is now becoming every day more "
pparent. The l:nes of communication by It
t?il Road and Steamboat between Agusta,
a Georgia, and New Orleans, are rapidly F
erring towards completion. The Road now
onstructing between Columbia and Branch- jj
ille, on the Charleston and Hamburg- Road, .
i expected to be finished the present sum. u
ner. When these Roads are completed and n
he Richmond and Fredericksburg Road shali ii
e extended to the Potomac, the whole chain n
om Boston to New Orleans will be perfectd,
except that portion between Raleigh and
Columbia, a distance of only two hundred
riiles.?'This centra) link, which is necessary a
o connect the two ends together, and thus ti
ive permanency and increased value to the
/hole, is of too much importance not to be
lied uo. The accommodation of rh" travel- 65
ng public from one extreme of the Union to fr
fie other, the safe, certain and expeditious w
ransportation of the United States Mail, the f,j
mnense advantage which such a line of tnfrna!
communication between North and in
Jouth would he to the General Government
ar the speedy transportation of troops in time h:
f War,, together with the enhancement of the r?
alue of the Stock in ail the Roads forming a
art of the great line, form sc strong a coin- 1
ination of interests in its favor as to leave no S(
oubt or its construction at, no distant pertd."

THE CfcOPS,
w
From information obtained from differ,
ot parts of this county, we are inclined 01
o think that, the wheat crop this year
ias fallen short of its usual average. The
avages of the fly a nd the chinch bu?r j.
lave been very severe, and many farmers
ost nearly their whole crops. We shall u
lowever, have an abundance of oats and ?
ither small grain; likewiseaf corn should
he season hold out as favorable as it has
leen thus far. We have never seen the
:orn crops look more promising at this ?j
eason of the year, than they do now.

FAILURES OF MAILS. ?j

mt more exempt than other modes of mail it

ransporramm irvm uuouapa mu Mciop, I j(
These accidents not being generally pubished,
le^ve the Public in ignorance of the ,
:ausea of inevitable irregularities in the trans ..
>ortation of the mails, and often subject the "
5ost Office Department to censure for delays
esulting from circumstance altogether beyond ft
ts control. w
It is not to be supposed that fines, 'even if: (j
hese self-willed corporations would consent g
o make themselves amenable to them in
heir contracts, would induce g 'eater caution
han that which is inspired by higher consid al
irations to guard against accidents, that en. rt
langcr not only the character and custom of w
he road, but always, more or less, the lives of o'
he passengers. p
To show how failures of the mail may and
lo constantly occur on the main lines, we
t.atethat,on the Tuscumbia railroad, (Ala.) J,
he mail engine got off the t rack on the 17th g
lit. On the next day the mail was lost by /.
he meeting of engines and trains. On the jl
list, on the same road, th? train was detain- *
id, and the mail failed by accident to meet of
be care. On the Petersburg railroad) the Jth
vwmmmmmmmmmmmmm
..ail failed gorng South on the 2<1 of June,
iwing to {he breaking of the axle of the tenler.
It failed going South on the 30th of
une by the engine being thrown from the track
before daylight) by log* of wood which soine
nalicious demon had laid across the road.?
Mem. Death should be inflicted for this
:rime, if abolished for all others. It he Mail
ailed coming North on the 6th of June, by a
nlteel of the baggage car getting loose. It
ailed on the l&th ult. coming North, in con.
equence of waiting at Garey's Ferry one hour
ifter the schedule time, the train Iroin NViL
aington'not being up.
Such are a few of the occurrences on the
;reat lines, often not generally known.

Cast Iron Churches.
St. George's Churrn, Liverpool, says the
tendon Mechanics Magazine in an object
f considerable interest tor its taste, and as
laving been nearly the first iron church erectd
in Great Britain.
The whole of the frame work of the winows,
doors, groins, roofs, pulpit, and ornamental
enrichments, are of cast iron. The
?n(fth is 119 foot. tho hrpartth 47 If is cr

][t is not par haps, generally known that a
[real proportion of tln? larger manufactories
reeled in England within the last ten years,

wo years past, several cottages and country

England, where wood is dear and iron

lian those of timber. In durability and in
eauty, they are ofconrse unequalled. When
lice finished such buildings require no re.
airs: and Jhe most finely carved ornaments
lost little more than plain castings.
Steam Bkidue.?The St. Louis Argus

A physician in Albany, New York,
ays, " We read last week a heart-sickenng
account of the decease of a fine and

from the prevailing infatuation which
;ads females to commit elegant ana reined
suicide, she is said to have been an
incommonly intelligent and promising

ight. The ribs were contracted to withit
half their natural circumference, and
be shoulder blades were actually lapped
ver each othe:! The chest was of course
xtremely narrow, and not half the najral
room was left for the action of the
eart, and the inspiraton of air into the
jngs. The consequence was death."
ER0CI0U3 ATTACK OX A MAN BY A HORSE.
An unprecedented instance of ferocity
i a horse was witnessed a few days ago
i the commune of YVilryck. A man
amed Dogroof was employed in plough-;
ig a piece of land ; his horse becoming
jstive, the ploughman endeavored to
tree obedience by blows, when the vie*
)us animal turned upon his master and
ttacked bim.with such obstinate sevenft
that, though a man of uncommon
rcngtli, be was speedily thrown on the
irth, after hiving sustained some very
ightlfu! iujusies ; his face covered with
ounds from the bites inflicted by the raid
animal, and his hands bruised in a
lost shocking manner. So far from the

to his rescue, when they found the

state of extreme suffering with two o
