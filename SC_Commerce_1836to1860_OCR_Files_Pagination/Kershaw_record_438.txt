^ WEDNESDAY MORNING, NOV. 4, 1810.
THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.
All ?pecalatioij 011 ^,s subjccf 's no,v perfectlj*
idle, and we shall not tliorcforo trouble our readers,
with any of our opinions as to the probable result.
We have made up our mind to boar with all possible
fortitude, the wreck of the hopes wo had entertained
of the election of Martin Van Bcre.v, and like
Jacob Faithful to expect ' better luck next time."
A sufficient number of States will have given their
votes for one or tlio other of the candidates, before
our paper reaches, most of its roaders to decide the
election. Ohio, and Pennsylvania voted on Friday
last, the former giving 21 and the latter 30 votes
Maine, New Hampshire, Connecticut, New York,
Virginia, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Missouri,
Arkansas, Goorgia, Mississippi and Kentucky voted
on Monday last, New Jorsoy, Louisiana and Ten.
on vestenlav: Rhode Island to-day. Mas
sachusetts, Maryland and Alabama will give their
votes on Monday nost, Vermont and Delaware on
Tuesday; and -North Carolina on T-tuaday the 12th
instant. Tho South Carolina electors, ore the last
chosen. Tae eloction is made by the Legislature.
I In all the other States, the pcoplo choose the electors,
by general ticket. The wholo number of votes is
294; and including the elections which are to be held
this day, the votes of 19 States will have been cast,
making an aggregate of 22S votes, from which it
iaiy be determined boyond doubt who is, or is not
to be the successful candidate. The returns from
these elections arc looked for with groat anxiety, by
many; but having made up our minds as to the re.
suit, wc shall wait patently for tiic official confirmation
of our fears, and bear, wo trust, our defeat
with becoming resignation.
Law Case.?A. cult involving the t?tlc to six geese
was recently tried in New Ojlcuns- The ovidciice
was so contradictory, that the judge ordered that
the geese should 1c turned Iocs\ and two ofliccrs
appointed to watch their movements, find if thoy
went to the plaintiff's house lie was dccidcu to be
tho owner, and the samo if they went to the defendant's.
At our lust accounts, they were quietly enjoying
themselves in a mud puddle in ono of the
^ streets, not having readied the house of either of
the litigants.
Tits United States Senate.?This body consists
of 52 inomlmrs; at present there arc four vacancies,
so that the parties arc now represented thus:
Democrats 28. Whigs 20. Tiio vacancies arc,
one from Virginia, one from Delaware, two from
North C irolana. If Whigs should he elected to supply
these vacancies, the parties wil1 then stand: i)e
mocrats 28, Whigs 21, and this will probably lie the
stato of parties m tho Senate, during the next Session
of Congress. On the 4th March next, the
term of servico of Wam. of New Jersey, Roane of
Virginia, Nicholas of Louisiana, Norvkll of Michigan,
and Lumpkin of Georgia will expire, and
unless somo revolution shall occur in the politics of
Its-vnn ?o r\r?rtkolil?i linir tll'IT* !in qun.
plied by Whigs. Should this be so, they will have a
majority ol" G in tho Sonate, Tiio parties will stand
thus, Whigs 2(1, Democrats 03. Thw is rather a
raoro gloomy aspect of Coming events, than we like
to contcmplato. It is, we think barely possible that
the result nay be as above stated. If however South
Carolina, was represented as she ought to be, and
Virginia should be true to herself, and her principles,
parties would bo equally divided, 26 to 26. Tho
Whigs, however, must have a much larger niajori.
ty than 6, before they do any thing moro than op.
pose tho measures of tho Democratic parly. The
principle of opposition is tho only one, in whicli
thorc is any gonoral concurrence of opinion among
them. They will divide, the moment they come to
carry out any scheme, of any branch, of the great
Whig party.
ELECTION FRAUDS.
Our exchange papers, particulaily those from the
North, are filled with the particulars of a fraud said
to have been committed by flic whig? of Now York,
end Fhiladolpbio, in the year 1^33, for the puiposc
of influencing the olrclions for the members of C'ongrass
in the former city. A vast number of affida.
its, and counter affidavits arc. published. From
these, it appears that Mr. J. D. Sti:vi:\?ox, former,
ly Tobacco Inspector, and recently an assistant in
that office, with James B. Gtr.Nrwor.ru, the preJooimiI
4r\ ! naw flir? In! tnr
?CaJI lUtUIJI JVili, UVOIJIU IV IUJUU "IUIHVI HIV iuuvi
would be re-appointed to the office lie held, should
tiior. Seward be ro-clccted. Mr, Glentwortii said
4 that he could ce:nm uid his rc.appoir.tmcnt, and
that the persons having the central power, would
net dare to remove hini" end further 44 that, lie was
possessed of documentary evidence, by which he
could enforce his claims."
Mr. Stevenson goes on to state, in his affidavit,
that in September last, !\Ir. Gi.kntwortii stated to
him, that ho hod been employed in the year 18.18,
by leading whigs in Now York, to procure, in
Philadelphia, of certain officers in that city, a number
of persons to proceed to New York and vote,
and that the whigs furnished him funds for that pur.
pose. That lie went to Philadelphia, in October
^ flbSS at -the instance of his employers, whom lie I
names,-among them, Mcms H. Grin.vei., at pre-j
scijt a whig member of Congress, to procure votes
for the full elections in New York. The affidavit is '
very circumstantial, and goes into particulars, not j
essentially necessary for our readers to get a fair
understanding of the matter. Mr. Swift the May-1
or, James Young high Constable, and Mr. Ristox i
a broker of Philadelphia, aro stated to leave assisted
Mr. Glentjiworth in procuring voters, which they
yere to furnish at from .$25 to ?39 a head. The
same scheme was arranged for tlio spring elections
;n 183D. The affidavit states that Glentwortii
carried with him thirty voters, who voted in every
ward in the city in the fall of lt-38 and spring of
1S39. Mr. Stevenson states that nftr>r ii1if.-rinin<?
these disclosures he received n letter from Glestworth
addrcE-sed to Swtft the Mayor of Piiila.de 1pliia,
stating that " the bearer Mas entitled to his
confidence," and that lie proceeded to Philadelphia,
mid convorscd with the Mayor, Vci.no, Kistox and
others, to whom he pretended that he wanted \ot- rs
fJr New York as in 1833 and 18.39. He states that
tjiej* not only promised to furnish Jjipi at the former.
I price, but acknowledged that they had scut on v<
, tors before. This is the substance pf the affidavit (
j i\Ir- Stevensox, and it is corroborated by letters an
receipts for money paid.
On the other side, the Whigs assert, that Glf.m
worth's mission to Philadelphia, was to procure pel
j sons to detect, and prctcnt frauds, similar to that no\
' charged on the Whigs, which was contemplated b
! tlio Democratic party.
j Thcso disclosures will in all probability, hav
I prevented the accomplishment of any such fraud b
j either purty at tho election just held.

THE BIBLE CONVENTION;
At the suggestion of the friends of the

the Slate, the time for holding the Coni
vention has been changed from the first It

jthat the second Tuesday will better sui

meetings, from being present on the first

I A T.\VERN WITHOUT A BAR.
We know n.'?t wheihcr il will be of an}
pecuniary advantage to our friend of the
"Victoria House," to annouce to the
j travelling public that ihfs establishment i;
J deficient in the toper's sine qui noil. But

I will like it none the worse for that. The
I "Mar," we readily admit, has many spa/!:
lints attractions; still ail are ready to con
le.-s that it is the source of many dispute]tudvs,
which at least a portion of the
' travelling community would like to avoid,

I highly, let it be tried?and tried loo by

Mexico.?We are indebted to a comI
mcrcial house in this city for a copy of
'two decrees recently promulgated by
; Anayo, commander-in-chief of tin F< .!(, I
ral troops in Tabasco, in relation to maj
ritimc commerce, The first provides for
j the exemption of national vessels from
' the tonnage duty,4?>r a reduction of onefifth
of the duties levied on goods imported
by vessels coming from any port in
| America, or of two fifths if arriving from
any European port. Those vessels only
! are considered national which have coni
formed to the law of 1833-? 34. on the
1 subject of national marine.
I The second decree contains eight provisions.
The first abolishes the duty on
anchorage, and provides a lounge duty of
I one dollar mid a half on foreign vessels.
The second prohibits foreign vessels from
earthing on the coast trade, hut perm'ts'
them to take cargoes of domestic merchandise,
on complying with tlie necessary
leitnaliites. The third permits the
free transport of current coin in foreign
vessrls, when it is downed to he employed
as capital in the market. The fourth
compels foreign vessels to furnish a triplicate
manifesto, a list of the provisions,
| crew and passengers. The fifth provides
! for the levy of three fifths of tlie duties
jreqnircd by the law of 1S37. The sixth
, abolishes all the customhouses in the iule!
rior, and removes the duties on goods cir;
ciliated in the country. The seventh ptr'
mils the introduction of goods pro hi hi ted
i hy the law of 1S27, provided a lax of fifty
per cent on the value of such goods,
be poid. The eighth exempts from all
imporiinig duties, the following articles: ?
powder, shot ar.d every kind of weapon
of war, and provisions of all kinds.

we can answer. From our heart we wish

. prevent that, you may be sure we cannot
t prevent their stealing from Salmagundi.

hope lie will reciprocate the favor.
