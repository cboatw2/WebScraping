} Mr. A. tlicn nllude] f.-> the course
of the Government of Maine Jurin]
the last spring?against which. M said
he would not al ti?e time consent to 'he
adoption of any proposition winch even by
imp jtatioi) could c ist .eenvire open the
Governor for his conduct. But. more recently,
lie (Mr A ) had seen evidences of
an exceedingly coo! and tame spbii
coming from toe S ate of Maine, fl ; did
not mean to say this was not very proper
under th^circumsanp?*s of toe times* ; hu:
he had satisfied himself that tnere was no
sort of danger to be apprehended from any
act of the people of ih.it State. The Legislature
of Maine declared at that time that a
the Government of the United Sfaies dtd not
take the mutter up. they would do justice
to thorns Ives. Now sljey declared that if
the British went on encroaching tnere, and
t_r.; i ti u.,.1 .1
prt?%US jli.iu ti%/ur" ?11jLi
were doing, they would call on the Gov rii
mcnt of the United Str?t 's t'> oroti"* them.
[Some conversation passed he:ween Mr.
Smith, of Maine, and Mr. Adams; after
which)
Mr, A said,all he intend'd to say was
what he did not think any member from
Maine would con.ra lief, that, in the event
of a second reference to a third Power, the
People of Maine would not commence a
war with Great Britain ; if any one did cootrudict
i', let the two statements be put side
by side.
Mr. A Smith said it was nix his feeling,
nor the furling of she People ofMum*-, that
this question sliould be again submitted to
a reference in the manner or at ad ond?*r the
terms upon v.-i, ch t wassubin t ed bv a for.
irter Adr.iiiiisfr < ioa.
.Mr. Adams s.i i t >e gentlemen was very
cautious m his declantiou that the people
would not submit to another reference, lie
* (Mr. A.) declared they would submit lo i\
und he said that they ought-to submit to it in
case the event should come : nnd one of l?is
chi?'f motives in addressing the House at t!iis
lime was o say that he approved en*irely of
this determina'ion on the part ofThe PresL
dent of the United S ates. He thought the
Chief Executive of this country was author.
xz^d lo make a reference, and he was gratified
to find such a determination had been
formed ; for nothing could b; more effectual
ia preventing that collision which many of
them, and he among the number, wore so
apprehensive of. He believed ' was the
most pacific and concl! if(ry . ou v- whir!,
could have been determined upon ; for thru
reason ho approved of it, and it would be
approved by the whole of the civilized race
of mankind. It came precisely to that
point in reference to which so many petitions
had be *n brought into this lious*, and
to which be wished the House ha 1 paid I
more attention?that was to say, a gei.eral
principle which by, the force of pool c opinion,
should compel all Governments in the
work! to resort to this naeific mode of settling
difficulties rather than bv a resort to
? - - - *rv , n i
war. The two nations?tne nrmsn rcopie
and the People of the United States?he
rargnt say unanimously, for he sraro !y be.
lieved there was a man but who deprecated
a war between the t.vo na'ions?all deprecated
a resort to war. Th ref-rence of
the question to arbitrators was an honorable
mode of proceeding ; no n liion coull refuse
to adopt such a course. Th* Hritith Government,
he maiiruici' d, must compulsively
whether they would or no', accept die pro
position ; and if not compelled, ihey would
do it from motives of policy ; an I therefore
he concluded them was no dang r of a war
The only doubt he could entertmn would
that the People of Maine, in the impotence
+ and impetuosity wh ch they mus* i.at.rdly
for ther own interests and t'i- ir own
,v? # .
rights, might, by thoir own indiscretion,
commence hostiliii's. fie did not.-howrver,
apprehend such an event, nor did he st.JI believe
that any member would ris and say j
that there was danger of war f <>m that
source.
Mr. Albert Smith was unab!e, lie said.
arter paying tbe strictest attention to th?* r<*
marks of the venerable gentlein-n from
Massachusetts, (Mr. Adams) to compre- j
hend them. He alluded to tie r marks of
that gentleman expres-ing his unwillingness
to throw even a scintilla ofcensure on the
course of Governor Fairfield last spring, and
compared th?*m wiih his pp sent d? clara ion,
that there wouid be no war unless the S at?? I
of Maine should, bv her own act, bring it
upon us. The soil was invad d lh? n. Was
it not invaded now ? Were the P -npl- o'
Maine suppos- d to have less regard for ti e
integrity of their soil this year th in th y h id
the last I And w< re they now to bo considered
indiscreet and rash for asserting
and maintaining its integrity 1 He certainly
could not compiehenJ the gentleman
from Masachusetts.
Mr. S. eulog'Z'id the Governor of M ?in<,
who still, he said remained a* Irs post. T e

their Chief Mug s rnf ; und so long us th.it
officer renin-d hissta'ion, he would ever
relinquish one io'a of the rights for illicit
the People of M line w ro r a l> to sh -.11???
last drop of their blood. W'.ether the National
Government d fended the int '-ir ty of
the soil of Maine or not. (of which, ho iiu?{
fto fears,) the gen Ieman from Massachusetts
would find tha: |!ie People of* hat S a e were
true to themselves, to their S ate, and the
country.
He agr"ed with the gentlenmn entirely as
to the tone of the correspondence alluded to.
mod he (Mri S.) regard- d that correspond
F> ence as u tnumphaut vindication of t?*e riglrs
of Maine, and not only s<>, bu as evincing
on p irtof the General Government an m
vincible determination to stand by the r gbts
of Maine.
Mr. S. was understood, in conclusion, to
say that the People of M in ? were willing
th t suitable persons should go on to tb?
territory with their treaty and their mstru
meats and draw the line, but they nev? i
would consent to submit a decision of tin
question to any tribunal on any other con lition
than that referroes should go upon i e
s land, examine the territory, und mark c u
and establish the tract.

Mr. T. was noi disposed to net upon the
matter of for ifixations now at all events.
U ther - was to be a war, or a reasonable
chance of a war?if there was one change

and such as would justify the confiden

not willing o neat wi h Great Britain whii.British
bayo.ifts and Britsh fortifications

co ist?he d< s red to t eat with arms in his
hands. But he was not d'spos d o uccele
rate th it state of tnings, or to create ad?t?tional
lever temfier in relat on to this question.
Six months would put us in a condition
to resist tiny aggression ; nay, he be.?
heved we in giit resist it without any fortifi

same m?'ans which enabled Gen. Jackson
o meet the eneiny on the plains of Louisiana.

Mr. T. repelled the idea of invasion oi
