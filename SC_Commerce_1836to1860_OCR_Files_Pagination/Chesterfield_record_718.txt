Agricultural Improvements.
Ttis Plow.?In this implement the advance in
thirty years has been truly astonishing. There is
scarcely less difference between the neat cast iron
dowof the present time, and the clumsey wooden
irticle used for the purjKJ.se at that period, than
>etween that and the iron jjointed crotohcd stick of
he ancients. In the ease of working and the cfjjjet'prodiiced
on the soil, every man competent to
r*judge will admit that the difference effected by improvement
in the last thirty years is equal to fifty
per cent.
Thrashing Machine.?Exjjcricncc shows that
the farmer who gets out and sells his grain in
autumn, admitting the prices arc the same, realizes
from his crop at least ten per cent, more than he
who does not dispose ol his crop till the next spring.
But it may be safely asserted thai in grain growing
districts, the whole force of the farm, if devoted
to that object alone, would not be able to bring
his grain into market in the fall, if thrashed by
hand. Hence the thrashing machine has conic to
his aid, and docs the work so much better and
quicker than it can be done by hand, that the getting
out of a thousand bushels of wheat is counted
. I
a small affair.
Horse Rake.?With this instrument, on land
fitted as meadows always should be, one man and
horse will do the work of six men with hand rakes.
The value of this labor-saving machine will no? 1
be disputed by those who have tested its power,
when time presses or storms lower over the hayfield.
It is not less valuable as a gleaner in the
wheat and barley stubble, where no care can prevent
a quantity of grain being left, surprising to j
one who has never gleaned with the horse rake.
Weight of Cattle.?The records of the Smith- J
field market, in London, prove that within one .
hundred years, the average weight of the cattle (
killed for that market, has nearly doubled, rising

jiviii uviwiui ivui uau iiiv ikui?u. v v. y ...w
greater part of this increase has been in the last
forty years. Jt is calculated that the cattle offered
at least fifty per cent, more at the present time
than they did twenty years since. This improve^^mt-nt
we owe to the knowledge brought to bear on
the breeding of cattle and agriculture generally.
Manures.?The preparation and application of
the most active and efficient means, with which
the farmer is acquainted, of increasing the produc- !
tivencss of his grounds, are the effect of chemistry
applied to agriculture. There are few who canremember
when bone-dust,lime, scamarls, urate, ,
poudrctte, &.c., were things never heard of; when ,
the accumulation of bones about our cities and soap
factories was a nuisance, and the only question
respecting other substances now so valuable, was,
us to the easiest manner in which they could Indisposed
of, when the leisure of winter imd the I
season of ice were embraced to transport them j
where the returning spring could convey them
to the ocean or elsewhere. IIow astonishing is

ascertained, tiiat the value of animal manures an
nually collected and applied to the crops in England,
at current prices surpass the whole amount
of its foreign commerce ; and that animal manure
has been and can be profitably imported into Eng.
land from so great a distance as the eastern portion
of the Pacific Ocean.
Agricultural Associations.?The splendid
agricultural improvements, now here and there exhibited,
arc the results of Agricultural Journals
and Agricultural Associations, where enterprising
individuals meet periodically, and by interchanging
all their ideas, increase the general stock in
at least the compound ratio of their numbers; each
one returns home with the knowledge posM-ssed by
the whole, and with a commensurate stock of new
suggestions for future reflection and experiment.
The spontaneous operations of the human mind,
in an unassisted state, require ages to arrive at re- !
.a. nniicH of numerous individ- I

uals, excited by emulation, would produce in per- !
haps a few days. Most other employments lead
to association, while the farmer remains in an isolated
state, scarcely regarding the operations of his
neighbor.
Agricultural Associations of this and other
States, have already effected wonders, and these '
wonders arc now becoming the joint stock of the '
Agricultural Society of this State, which has been 1
got up by the unremitted and persevering exertions
of a few gentlemen, who have thereby conferred
lasting benefits upon their countrymen.
Indian Corn.?The benefits of skilful cultivation,
arc shown in the improvement of the corn :
' crop, as much j>crhaps us in any other way. A
crop of seventy-five bushels per acre is now as
common as fifty was twenty years since; and
there can be little doubt but that one hundred bu>h?Is
per acre arc now oftcncr reached than was seventy
at that time.
IFrhts.?Compare the quantity and quality of J
tlm fruits and vegetables now offered ill our mar. 1
f? kcts with tho-ae exhibited thirty years since, and
?8 the improvement is astonishing. From the growth
|fl cucumber to the production of the most dcHrficious
of our fruits, the influence of science is felt, !
and the encouragement for further effort, and the
certainty ?>f an ample reward. i~? everywhere
Breeding Stock.?The progress of improve,
nent in breeding has been so great, that the best
jrecders have no longer any occasion to use the
)ld proverb," A good cow may have a bad call";"
m the contrary they can say with confidence,
their good cows never had bad calves. A skilful
>bservance of the laws of nature has wrought this
change. Formerly there may have been as good
animals as we have now, but then it was accidentill,
and there was no certainty the progeny would
resemble the parent; now the breeder makes the
?ood qualities constitutional, and is thua certain
af the character of his animals.
Improved Bigs?Here there is an improvement

the animal, can deny. The dullest eye can distinguish
between the round, fat, beavtiful Berkshire,
and the thin, lean, long-nosed and long-legjed
hound-like creature, which seems more fitted
Tor tiie chase than for the sty. The fanner feels
the difference in the corn-crib, and more than all
in his pocket. The difference in the cost of feed,
ing and in the pork made, between the improved
varieties and those generally fed twenty-five years
since, is not less than forty per cent. This is the
result of skilful st lection and crosses.
The name of Washington is entitled to deathlike
veneration, because he made our country free.
Who can dispute his claim to an equal perpetuity
of gratitude who has made that country beautiful
and delightful ? When the creation was finished,
14 Clod planted a garden in Eden," from which our
first parents were driven for disobedience, and instructed
to till the ground for themselves. But
Infinite Wisdom invested their descendants with
reason, by which virtuous industry could restore
the temporal primeval blessing, by the god-like
act of planting another garden, replete with fruits,
numerous and delicious, and flowers as beautiful
and as fragrant as those of blissful Eden. The
inun who has not only done this for himself, but
who by his talents lias exerted a praiseworthy emulation
in others to do the same, not only in his
awn city and State, but throughout the country, is
II. A. S. Dearborn.
Farm Houses, Gardens, Ac.?A more correct
taste in the construction of farm houses and outhouses,
and particularly in the department of gardens
and yards, is now plainly to be seen; for
though much cannot be expected from the farmer
on these points, the smallest attention to them is
proof that information and a spirit of improvement
have reached him, and lie begins to think.
Albany Cultivator.
Cultivation ok' the Grape.
There is no department of agriculture which
lias been so systematically neglected by farmers
generally, as the cultivation of fine and delicious
fruits. This is a matter of surprise, whether we
regard profit, or the pleasure and satisfaction to be
derived from an abundant supply for our own families.
IIow delightful and wholesome at all seasons
of the rear (as we may if we will) in the bo
""" <J * r
soul of our families, surrounded, perhaps, by our
friends and neighbors, to refresh ourselves with
the various gifts of Pomona.
There is hardly any fruit which can be more
easily cultivated, or may be made longer to ad.
minister to our pleasure or profit, than the grape.
Of this, there is almost an endless variety, both
foreign and native; none of the former, and but
few of the latter, should be cultivated by farmers
generally. The Isabella, Catawba and Clinton,
may be classed among the best native varieties?
though in all parts of the country, there arc some
wild nameless varieties, rich and delicious, for the
neglect of the propagation of which, our farmers
are without excuse, for the grape is wholesome,
and may justly be called one of the greatest delicaches,
which an all-wise and bountiful Creator
has bestowed upon man.
This fruit is easily cultivated, and may be increased
to any extent with no expense but the labor,?from
cuttings which may be obtained in
thousands, from any person pruning his vines, or
some exquisite variety may be obtained from the
hedge or the swamp, and propagated to any extent.
Will you give this subject your attention ?
The best grapes are superior to either the peach,
the apple, or the pear?coinc after the former has
pretty much gone, and may be kept through the
winter, as well as the apple or pear. For winter
use they should be packed in layers in small
boxes, with a stratum of common cotton batting
between the layers. Thus they may be kept till
.March, better in flavor than when they were firct
?r:.tJirrrd from the vines. They should be kept
? ?
coo), dry, and away from the frost.
The best mode of cultivation in the garden is
on a single trellis, running North and South?the
posts of which should either be cedar or have cedar
bottoms, and then be spliced about ten feet
high, and have strips of board about two inches
wide nailed on to them about three feet apart.?
The usual way of cultivating them, on an arbor,
with an arch, is had for the reason that those clusters
which do not get the sun, will seldom ripen
well, and if they do, they will be without flavor.
They should immediately after the full of the
leaves, be thoroughly pruned and have every runner
of new woodcut within five buds or eves of the
old wood. They should be kept open and free.?
New shoots should be encouraged near the ground
in order to have the bearing wood low, and to protect
the frames from the winds.
They may be cultivated at flic foot of old and
worthless fruit trees, or 011 shade trees, and after
three or four years of protection from the cattle,
they will give you no farther trouble. Thus the
cure and expense of trcllising and pruning, will be
? I
wuouy spurcu.
One single Isabella vine cultivated in this way
has been known to produce for the four years last
past, front ten to fifteen bushels per year. Such a
vine as this, in the vicinity of any of our cities, or
largo manufacturing villages, would yield more
profit than two acres of Indian com.
Now, farmers, do you want to have a few
bushels of fine grapes for winter, to cheer the so.
eial circle, and gladden the hearts of your friends
and guests during our long and winter evenings ?
//' so ifOti hove hut to will il and it is dour. You
can obtain vines at twenty-five ccnt3 apiece. This
I
luxury is at the command of the rich and poor?
then go ahead and adopt the mode of culture best
adapted to your circumstances, and for tlii* advice
we shall ask no greater reward than a rich cluster
of delicious grapes, when we call on you three
years from next February, if our life shall be so
long continued unto us.?Boston Cultivator.

supply his family with bread for the coming year.
He has on his place one of the Utica mills, with
which he grinds the grain. For the want of a
flour mill with bolting cloths, Mr. B. uses book
muslin over a common sifter?and, with this contrivance,
a supply of superfine fresh flour is bolted
whenever the occasion requires. With this hint,
we should not be surprised if every farm-house in
the State should be speedily converted into a flour
mill. Our march towards perfect independence is
very rapid.?S. W. Farmer.
SUBSTITUTE FOR GLUE AND CAULKING.
The remarkable properties of a new cement
have lately been tried by the master ship-wrights
at Woolwich, England, by advice of the lords of
the admiralty. The experiments were highly interesting,
and the results very important. Two
pieces of African wood, called teak, very difficult
to join by glue, on account of its oily nature, had
a coating of the composition in a boiling state, applied,
and shortly afterwards bolts and screws were
attached to the end of each piece, and the power '
of a Bramah's hydraulic engine applied, to the
extent of nineteen ton9, when the chain broke,
without the slightest perceptible strain where the
joining had been made. A still larger chain, of
one and a half inches, was then applied, which
broke with a strain of twenty-one tons, also without
effect upon the cement!
Four pieces of hard wood were then joined to??I
- ? -.?ll-.?*!..rvl., AVfls fnnr flmnannr)
gcmcr, wi'igmiig wucbiivtij vivi iuui
four hundred pounds, and carried to the top of
the shears in the dock yard, seventy-six feet high,
and precipitated upon the hard granite w^l bclo%
without the joints yielding in the slightest manner!
A number of oak plank, eight inches thick and
sixteen inches square, were then united with the
cement, together, eight feet in height and eight
feet in length, of the size of a first-rate ship of
war, without any thing else in the form of a bolt,
or security of any kind, and it was set up as a
target at the butt, in the masses, in the presence
of the officers of artillery, &c. Several shots were
then made into the cemented planks, the effects
of which were wonderful. They tort the wood
to pieces but had no effect upon the cement. A
hole six inches in diameter was then bored in the
center of the target, and a three and a half pound
shell inserted and exploded by a slow match,
which tore the wood into small splinters, without
in the least sejm rating the composition.
A valuable property of this composition, in addition
to its wonderful tenacity, it is said to be its
capability of expansion in warm climates, like India
rubber, and yet it will not become brittle under
the coldest temjieraturc. It is not surprising that
it has become a great favorite with naval officers,
as it is so clean as to resemble very much the
French polish.
The value of the compostiion on board of vessels
at sea may be illustrated by another experiment
tried with it. Eight pieces of wood in the
form of a mast, were joined together and a strain
applied to another mast ofanent're piece of wood,
when the latter firxt gate tray ! Ship carpenters
will, therefore, find no difficulty in effecting repairs
at sea, with this extraordinary cement at
hand. Nor is its value confined to the above or
naval purposes, but it must become equally great
for all purposes of the arts, where the joining of
parts is necessary, as it is insoluble in water. Its
cost is only about half that of common glue. The
great saving, too, by its universal adoption, and
the important uses to which it may be applied, are
incalculable. A Mr. Jeffrey is the inventor, and
the composition consists of shellac and India rub.
her, dissolved in naptha, in certain pro|>ortions.

SILK WEAVING.
Two very curious pieces of silk fabric, showing
the great perfection to which the art of silk weaving
has attained, may now be seen in this city.?
One of these deserves notice from the fact that every
process in its manufacture has been performed
by the *:nnc individual. He raised the silk worms,
invented and made the spinning machine and loom,
spun and dyed the thread, and wove the fabric.
This piece is a copy of the Declaration of Indc.
pendence. On a red satin ground the whole document
is copied in perfectly distinct and handsome
I letters, interwoven with black. At the end are fac
similits of the signatures of the members of the
Continental Congress. They arc skilfully executed
so as to bear a very marked resemblance to the
original. The whole is surmounted by a colored
head, intended for a portrait of General Washington.
This curious piece of stuff is now on exhibition
at the Boston Museum. Mr. Hard}', the manufacturer,
as we have said, has the credit of the
whole process. The loom on which it was woven,
which is a curious machine, highly creditable to
his skill, is also exhibited, and its manner of working
shown.
Another fabric of a somewhat different nature,
the work of one of the large French establishments,
may be seen in the picture gallery of the Athemrum,
which, as our readers will remember, is now
open. It is a woven portrait of Mr. Jacquard, the
inventor of the Jacquard silk loom. It is framed
and glazed, and unless very closely examined, has
exactly the appearance of a fine engraving printed
on paper. The likeness is, apparently, perfectly
preserved ; it is at least quite evident that the artist
had power to preserve it as readily as if he
were engraving it on copper. We had no idea before
of the perfection to which the figures woven
on silk fabrics could be brought.?Boston Advertiser.
The farmer who lets the sun get the start of him
in the morning, need not expect himself ever to
get the start of poverty.
