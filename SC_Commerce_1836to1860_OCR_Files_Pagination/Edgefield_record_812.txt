The House then went into Committee,
and resunied the consideration of the reso'
lotion proposing the reference of tbat-por

Western waters, to the- Committee on
Commerce.
Mr. Weller having the floor, spoke for
an hour with great severity, in reply to
the political stump speech of Mr. Stewart
of Pennsflvania, the other day.-The lat
ter. bad-affirmed that-Mr. Van Buren had
-committed himself against appropriations
for internal improvements. Mr. Weller
said this was false, and to prove it, he re
ferred to the fact,.that in May, 1838, Mr.
Van Buren actually signed a bill making
an appropriation for the continuance of the
Cumberland Road. He then shewed by
the Senate Journal, that in 1840 both Mr.
Clay and Mr. Crittenden voted against a
bill for that purpose.
Some very spirited explanations took
place between Messrs. Stewart & Weller;
but the latter persisted in denouncing the
speech of the former as a tissue of misre
presentation and falsehood.]
Mr. Morris, of Penn.. rose and asked
Mr. Weller. if he intended distinctly to
charge Mr. Stewart with falsehood.
Mr. Weller said onegentleman at a
time was enough. What he had said he
had said.
Mr. Stewart was understood to say
something of a hostile character, and
which had reference tocalling Mr. Weller
to account elsewhere.
Mr. Brinkerhoff next took the floor. Ije
had just commenced an argument relative
to the Tariff, in connexion with Western
improvements, when he fainted.
Owing to this, the Committee rose and
the House adjourned.
Mr. Holmes is a prodigious .favorite
with the Western members, for the high

In the Senate, a copy of a letter from
Mr. Sprague was received, resigning his
seat, on account of the melancholy death
of his-brother, with whom he had been in
partnership.
Mr. White presented a resolution of the
Legislaiture -of Indiana, instructing the
Representatives and Senators of that State
to votein favor of Gen. Jackson's bill, and
against the ''two -.hundred Land Scrip
scheme,-also against any measure which
provided for a distribution of the proceeds
from the 1ublic lands.
Mr. Wh ite gave his views at some length
on the various subjects referred to in the
resolution, after which it was laid on the
table.
Mr. Bates presented a resolution of the
present Legislature of Massachusetts, and
signed by Mr. Brigs, the Governor, in fa-.
vorbf such an amendment of the Ctmsti
tution as will- strike off the slave represen
tation of the South.
Mr. -King, in a speech full of fire, de
nounced- the resolution as a proposition to
dissolve the Union. It was the same, in
substance, as thai passed by the Hartford
Convention. Then, however, there was
some excitement, which might serve as a
palliation; but now, u hen no excitement
existed, such a proposition could not be
condemned in language too severe.
Messrs.Sevier, Bugby, and others, gave
their views, after which Mr. Bates replied.

on the subject of the Panama Canal. H1e
is authorized to conclude a Treat with
the governments of Great Britain. France,
the United Statas, Holland and Spain, in
order that said governments may charge
themselves with the enterprise. The ju
risdiction of the whole line of communica
tion is to be reserved to New Grenada;
with a certain per centage on the produce
of the tolls, until the cost of the Canal is
reimbursed. He is authorized to conclude
with a Private Company, willing to under
take the enterprize, provided its govern
ment will first guarantee that the use of
the Canal shall he neutral.
The Government of New Grenada, will
give as its contribution to the enterprise,
the woods, quarries and tmines of mineral
coal, as well as the public lands which may
be required, to the extent of 300,000 acres
-these lands, not only to be applicable to
the constitution of the said Canal, but may
be distributed among emigrants who may
wish to settle there. in quantities not ex
ceeding 200 acres to one family.
The commencement of the enterprise
must be made within two years from the
date of whatever Treaty is concluded.
The fundamentallpriaciple is, the equal

the enterprise.

Melancholy death by Fire.-On Wed -
nesday last, as a young lady of this city
was standing by the fire-place imp the par;
lour, her "dress took fire and'loosing her
presence of mind, she was unable to give
the alarm, no one being present but two
little children, whlo were unable to render
her any assistance; and the family were
only apprized of the fact by some of the
neighbors, who saw her, enveloped in
flames, : while making her way into the
yart. They immediately hastened to her
assistance, and soon extinguished the fire:
but, alas ! too late to render her any ma
terial relief; she was so much burnt that
she died rom the effects on Friday even
ing. We notice the occnrence more par
ticularly as a caution to all, and particu.
larly to heads of families, whose children
are frequently left alone in rooms where
there is fire.-Charleston Courier 22d inst.
New Method of Working Butler.-A
very useful and ingenious mode of extract
ing whey from butter, was recently related
to me by a gentleman who had resided
many years in the grazing - districts of
France ; and he informed me that a simi
lar apparatus is at present in successful
operation, near by here, in this State, al
though 1 have not yet seen it. He descri
bed it in a manner that could not fail to be
understood by any farmer in the Union.
The machine, he represented as made of
,vood, in form not much unlike a grind
stone, closely fitted into a trough, leaving
a space between the stone and bottom of
the trough not exceeding a sixteenth of an
inch in thickness. The trough is -first
filled with clean water saturated with
salt, one end of which is crowded full of
the newly-churned butter. Then the stone
is put in motion by means of the crank or
otherwise, and the butter is drawn beneath
it, and comes out at the other end of the
trough in thin sheets, not more than one
sixteenth of an inch in thickness, almost
entirely freed from the whey, and for com
mon use requires no further salting.. The
brine thus prepared. has another very im
portant office to perform. It imbibes, by
chemical affinity, all the whey with which
it comes in contact, and leaves the butter
by itself. -
Although this apparatus is extremely
rude and simple, itis obvious to an ingeni
ous mechanic, how easily such a machine
could be improved upon, and answer a
tenfold purpose.-Correspondence Ameri

Sheller for Stock.-T he pritnei pes of
comfortable, economical shelter are little
studied, and much less pratised than they
should be. Many think when they have
built their barn, and are able to tic up their
stock at night, that every thing is accom
plished ; whereas they have only advan
ced in the first etep. To be sure this is
the most important one ; yet we hold, in
addition to the shelter of the stables at
night, open sheds joining on ,to and run
ning out from the barn, making at least
three sides of a square, and enclosing com
modious yards, are nearly as necessary
fr sunning and exercise by day, especial
ly for .the younger part of the stock. These
may be made very cheap, with board
roofs and sides; and if sawed stuff is diffi
cult to be obtained, with logs ruled up for
the sid$es, and well chinked and plastered
with clay, and poles over-laid with coarse
hay or straw for a roof. Where timber is
sarce, a stone wall, or an earth embank
ment may be thrown up six or seven feet
high, or a double row orrails or light poles
can he laid up three feet spar), or so, and
then filled in with coarse hay or straw for
the wall shelter. The only objection to
this is, that however poor the hay or straw,
the stock, frequently frotn mere wanton
ess, will pull it and devour it; but after
remaining one year, ii becomes musty and
foul, and they are not apt to do so.
Another great consideration in making
sheds and yards, and having them well
supplied with litter, is, that by keeping
stock confined in them, all the manure,
both solid and liquid, is saved ; and itn ad
dition to their extra comfort, animals eat
less and thrive better than when unprotec
ted and suffered to roam at large. Water
for drink of as warm a temperature as
can be obtained from a spriitg or well,
ought to be bountifully stupplied in the
yard, and in atuch a manner as not to over
low and wet the ground or lit ter around.

From Florida-By the arrival of the
steamer Win. Gaston, Capt. Freeland, we
are in receipt of the St. Augustine News,
of the. 20th inst.
The Runaway Negroes.-The News
contains the following information in re
lation to the visit of the Marshal of Flori
ida, to Nassau, to demand the negroes who
escaped from the Territory a short time
since: "We learn by way of Tamnpa from
Key West, that. the U. S. Revenue sehr
Nautilus, Capt. Walden, returned to that
port on the 3rd inst., from Nassau, New
Providence, bringing Col. Jos. B Browne,
the U. S.-Marshal for the Southern )is
trict of Florida, who had been especially
authorized by the. Secretary of State to
visit that Island, for the receiving of the
runaway negroes who committed, a mur
der at Key Biscayne, in September last.
The vessel arrived at Nassau on the 24th
December, when Col. Browne immedi
ately communicated with the Governor,
Sir Francis Cockburn, apprised him of the
object of his visit, to which His Excellen
cy promptly -eplied, requirirng the names
and ol'ence of the parties, which, upon
being given, a warrant was issued to her
Majesty's Judges, Lees, Sandiland, and
Gahau to receive the necessary testimony,
in order that warrants of apprehension
might be issued. The United States Mar
shal then laid hef re the Court the Bills of
Indictment foundby a Grand Jury for the
counties of Munro and Dade, which was
overruled by the Court as not evidence ad
missible in a British Court-and that at
the statute upon .which the Treaty was
founded requiredieither the .original.depo
sitions, or viva voce testimony, against ibe
fugiti yes, and as none such had been of.
fered, the case was dismissed. The ob
ject of Mr. Browne's mission thus-brought
to a close, the Nautilus sailed for the U.
States.
It is gratifying to state that this delicate
business between two nations- was conduc
ted by Col. Browne with great prudence,
real and discretion; eliciting warm feel
ings of courtesy and good will from the au
thorities of the Bahamas, and by whom
Aas extended every facility to ihe Marshal
and the officers of the Nautilus..
The negroes being still at large, and no
positive evidence thus far brought against
them, leaves the matter still open for far
ther pursuit, and we can but-trust that our
own Government will sufficiently appre
ciate the importance of this subject, as a
precedent, to pursue it to such an end as
will vindicate the supremacy of our Ter
ritorial laws."
Miraculous Escape.-The schr. Star
arrived at this port yesterday morning,
from New Orleans, fell in, anileseast fr
Charleston Bar, wvith Daniel Webber, one
of the seamen of the sehr. Alex. Watson;
o a. A (or this port, from Savannah, pre
viously reported as having been wrecked
on the South breaker of Lauford's Chan
nel, wh. states that the sehr. ttent ashore
on Wednesday morning last in attempting
to coss the bar. Shortly after, both masts
went by the board, the vessel bilged and
filled, having only the quarter deck out of
water, to which they all retreated during
the day. They cut the stern boat froma
the davits, and'hauled her up along side,
to attempt to reach the shore-but before
they could get into her a heavy sea came
and parted the boat's painter, and she went
adrift. They were therefore compelled to
remain on the quarter deck. In the after
noon, the Gen. Clinch hove in sight, when
they expected to have been taken off, but
the state of the weather was such that no
assistnce could be rendered. The steamer
after waiting a while, proceeded on.
About a half hour after the steamer left,
the quarter deck separated from the other
part of the vessl. The Captain and one
of the crewv taking one part, and the mate
atd Weber taking another. The wind
being off the land, they were shortly af
te driven from among the breakers to sea.
WAeber .thinks it was full one hour and a
half before night-fall when the quarter
deck separated from the other part of the
vessel. He is of opinion that the Captain
and the other man were drowned shortly
after leading the wreck The mate and
himself drifted together at sea. unttl Thurs
day night, when he fell asleep, and on wa
king up, he found that the mate was gone.
Previous to this the mate was failing fast,
and he was afraid that he would not be
able to hold out. On Saturday morning
last, the schooner Star .hove in sight-he
rose on his feet and waved his South-wes
ter, a hat which he wore. Previous to
this, he, however, had been discovered,
and the sehr. promptly bore down and
took him off', almost exhausted having had
nothing to eat or drink during the time.
He had with him a leathera sheath for his
knife, which he was compelled to chew
up. The- Cook,-a negro man, died before
leaving the wreck, having lost his hold,
and was drowned. During all the time he
was at sea, hope did not forsake him. He
continued to think some friendly hand
would be extended to save him-and in
this he was not disappointed. We have
not been able to ascertain correctly .the
the names of all the crew. The Captain's
name was John Smaller Miller-the
Mate's name was Pennacy, and the other
white man went by the name of Jessie
