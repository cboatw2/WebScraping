him weli out of it; but he will want other co- i
operators than the legislators of N. York and
Virginia; and other advisors than the president
and directors of broken banks, o{ land
jobbers upon loans from deposite banks.
I think of this as I thought of the dry-dock,
gun-boat, restrictive anti-navy system of Mr.
Jefferson. It cost the nation a terrible war J
to be delivered of that, but the nation was ef
fectually cured by its hydrophobia. The war
was a drastic purge, but it effectually worked
its cure. I fear our present bankruptcy will
need a still more violent course of alteratives;
but the cure will coine when the people are
prepared to receive it. They are certainly
not so now; they will most probably not be so
during the remnant of my time of life. I hope
you will live to witness and enjoy the convalescence.
Forgive the freedom with which I have answered
your letter, and believe me to be,
with great respect, vour friend and servant.

Elections for Congress.?The election of
members to Congress takes place in North
aro'ina to-morrow. In some ol the counties
it Iras already taken place. A slip from the
Faycttcville Observer, states that in Wayne
county, Shepherd, the Whig candidate, received
a m ijority of 31 over Mr. Mostly, his opponent;
two precincts not heard from, which were
expected to increase the majority. In 1833
the Van Buren majority in this county was
5'2G; in August last 383; in November 400.
At the last Congressional election, l\Ir.
Speight, (V. 3.) received in the whole district,
composed of seven counties, a majority of
707. The IVhigs now seem conlhlent of success.
In Maryland, where the elections are just
over, no change has been made in the political
character of the representation; hut the
Whig vote was stronger in all the districts
than at the lust election.'
The returns for Member of ('engross fur
Ed^ecomV, have been- received. The vote
stood fo Wilson, (Vin Buren) 1187; for Stanley,
(Whig) 77.?Ralirgh Standard.
The Raleigh Register says without, giving

Important Discovery.?A discovery ha? j
been recently made, winch, as we understand, j
is likely to prove of the greatest importance to
the commerce of this country. A new ship
! channel has been found, leading over the bar
into the Bay of New York. It lies to the east
i of the channel hitherto known and used, and
i not distant from the Long Island shore. It is
j of commodious width, averaging about a qnari
tcrofa mile, and saves three or four miles of
j the distance. But the great advantages which
! it presents is, that it allows entrance and de- j
i parture from the port, during the prevalence j
j of winds, which now forbid either. In tern- J
[ pestuous weather, when access by the channel i
i hitherto used is impossible, vessels may enter ;
j by the newly discovered one, and anchoring |
; in the Horse Shoe, the harbor formed by '
. Sandy Hook, Staten Island and the New .Ter- j
1 scy shore, may wait i:i safety for a piloj. The j
j danger of an approach to our ports is thus j
' happily and greatly lessened.
| It is singular that with such an immense j
J commerce as is continually arriving and de- |
! parting, the existence of so commodious an j
! entrance should have remained unnoticed in
! our charts, and unknown to the most expe-'
rienced navigators of our waters. \Y? have i
been told, it is true, that some of the pilots pretended
that they were acquainted with it, but i
we are not inclined to give credit to this story.
If the pilots knew of if. how can they '
i answer to their conscience, for concealing a
| fact which would have diminished so greatly
j the delay and danger of the access to our

that they had left him in a snow storm, because
he would not abandon his horse.

was brought to Cantonment Leavenworth by

however, that no apprehensions need be entertained

A survey is also making on the ridge between

are few men in private circlet? whose loss
would be so sensibly felt and ao deeply regretted.
lie was eminently a benevolent man,
as well as a man of most remarkable energy
and efficiency in whatever he undertook. But
the brightest ornament of his character was
his ardent, cor.estent, deeptoned christian piety.
His friends mourn, but not as those
without hope. They have full assurance in
the uniform tenor of his life and conversation,
that their loss is his gain.

PROSPECTUS
Of the Financial Register of the United
Slates.
The recent suspension of specie payments
by the hanks of New York, Philadelphia. Bos
ton and Baltimore, which cannot fail to tc
come general throughout the United States,
? at-.t.y ,it iUinnre tvh:rh 1M3V. if mill
jjri.'SCiUf U DIUIV. ut < - ? ??J , .. J,
lie opinion be not led in a j roper direction,
involve the most fatal and disasterous results.
The country will shortly be divided into three
great parties?one advocating the destruction
of all banks, and the scheme of a currency
.- olely metalic; and the second supporting the
doctrine of a permanent incontrovertible paper
system, and a third, urging the restoration
of specie payments by the banks at the
earliest possible period at which it can be effected,
with the least injury to the public. Of
these plans, the first is impracticable, and the
?econd would he ruinous to the industry, cap.
ital, and morals of the country. The third is
the only one that is both practicable and ex- <
pedie.ut, and the one that calls for the u lited j
energies of all the advocates of conservative
princip'es andofallwlo res ects the rights .
?f industry, the rights of property, and the <
aws of meal obligaticn. E detaining those
sentiments, the advertiser proposes to publish j
i semi-monthly journal, to he mainly devoted, <
or the present, to the accomplishment of this ?
jreatend; and he confidently relies upon the j
jatronage of a large number of his follow cit- ;
zlmis to sustain him in the ellbrt. All who\<
initc with him in sentiment must be aware of (
he importance of prompt and energetic ac- <
ion, and of the immediate and wide diffusion
)f knowledge upon the principles of currency. J
ignorance on this subject has brought us to
)ar present bankrupt condition, and nothing |
:an save us from deeper and more lasting dis- j
ress, but the dissemination of the important j
ruths *vh h r"ascn ard experience hive
taught in reference to banking, currency and
linance.
The vast annual increase of the rooniod institutions
of the United State?, and the intimate
connection v\h:ch subfcistB between
their financial operations and those of Europe,
are becoming every day mere and more objects
of interest, 011 both sides of the Atlantic.
There were on the 1st of January, 1837, in
the different states and territories of the Union,
s x hundred and seventy-seven incorporated
banks, having one hundred and forty-six
brunches, dependent of one another, each of
which issues notes, and consequently contributes
towards tire mass of the paper currency,
which will soon exclusively fill the entire channels
of circulation; and it is evident that a
knowledge of much of the statistical information
which is connected with their expansions
and cn'ractions would be highly beneficial to
every section of our country, as well as to
merchants and capitalists abroad. A knowledge,
also, of the state of pecuniary allltirs in
Great Britain,and on the continentof Europe,
from which we have obtained bo many loans
and to which we may again, after the resumption
of speciepayment^ look for additional aid
in the various enterprizes requiring capital,
in which our different states hive embarked,
would seem to be essential to all our raonied
institutions and to a large body of our citizens _
and public men. Indeed, without abroad
view of the condition of ihe currency in both
quarters of the world all great financial enterprises
must be conducted in tiie dark; and
when this is the case, it is easy to perceive
what disasters may follow in their train.
In undertaking this work, the advertiser
his no political party ends \o answer. Matter?
which concern the happiness and well
being of the whole community are of too h;gh
importance to be made the sport of party warfare.
Banking, currency, and finance belong
to science, and not to party politics; but* nevertheless,
where governments and legislatures
so far forget what is due to science, and
<i : J . c r?:? >? *??

.politicnl arena, it comports with the plan of
this work to condemn their conduct and expose
their ignorance whenever betrayed, let
the offenders belong to whatever party they
may.
The editorial department of the pnbheation
will be placed in competent hand*, and original
communications maybe expected from
several gentlemen who have studied financial
subjects. As to selected matter, the publisher
trusts there will be presented to the intelligent
inquirer after truth a collection of statistical
documents, historical records, and scientific
arguments, which will be worth his pcnisal,
as may be seen from the following table of
proposed
