And I would ask this enlightened audience, where !
would now be our^boaatedzprivileges, and liberty !
if Lutner, the Puritans, and the* Adamses, the >
Pmckneyt, the Rutled?es, had not shot ten years |
in advance of the people to proclaim the doctrin r j
bffr^dom? Yea, more. Where should we now!
' be, if Columbus had aht persisted in his scheme j
to discover a New world in spite of the jeers, taunts, j
. and soora of the learned of the Old? To benefit j
the people, one must lead off, in front ot tnem; j
he nrett bra\g man up to himself and not J
come down to them. To court tho popu- j
)*r broatlj. ens must band the M cringing knee," !
|?lostar over men's faults, flatter their vani.
tie*, feed their vices, and praise their weak- j
' ncsces- But the reformer, the benefactor of {
mankind, takes a different course; discarding the i
to.igue of popular applause, reproving the vicce, !
eapoiUig the foibks, probing t.- the quick the ,
*.?? festering on the body-politic, he plants him. j
aoif ca high ground, and defends it with his heart's
blood!
Toe.totalers, stand jour ground, fiinoh not; your
Cause is the cause of righteousness, and your weapons
arc truth omnipotent. Men will call you
babbitt*. 80 they did Paul; but his babbling coneuercd
the world. YoUr numbers are few: at his
hrst meeting only seven listened to the words of
Wesley though his lips were touched with a live
coal from-off the altar of God; now thousands
claim him as their spiritual head: at first
Martin Luthtr had not a singic follower, now
hundreds of thousands will not number his con.
vert*. Truth has a vitility th it cannot be extin.
gauhed : if it is crushed it will burst out somewhat*
else, " like the smothered fires of a slumberiog
volcano"." As Milton says of his angels,
" Vital in every part
It can but with annihilation die."
It may be . I
" Troubled on every side, but not distressed,
Woeping but yet despairing not, cast down
But not destroyed."
With such armor, go forth in your might, preach :
temperance, and extend the hand of syinpatny to !
the votary of intoxication, wherever you see him. !
If he is wallowing in his tilth iness, n't hint out of hi*
dsfilement; is he hungry, fec i hi:n; .s ho naked,
ciathc him; has he no useful occupation, furnish,
hiaa with work; is he friendless, stick closer to
j b;?i than a brother; is he an outcast from socioty,
throw wide open to him the door of mercy and'
forgiveness. Tnc more he is debased, the greatslet
your condescension be; the less hopeful h.s
cise, the more active should be your exertions.?
confidence begets confidence, sympathy draws ,
oat sympathy. Tne drunkard miy be m nglin;
?.ii the brutes: stiu he has a divinity within him;
!a? image of Chod is stamped on his soul, and conscience
is only silent, not destroyed.
The temperance reform is one entirely of lore

never aid an/ causj; force them, ah J they w U 1

by should keep quiet, than to Join the enemy.? j
Cvnwro not the rumseller; you have but little to
do with hiia any way. Pcrsuide men not to J.
drink, and then it matters not how miny gogcries
are in the village. Cjt off the demand, and ;,
the supply will immediately cease. If there arc j j
no drinbom, there will be no sellers ; if rum is not j 1

ths everlasting truths of the Gospel. 13ut lie is ,
the mere instrument; the Holy Sp.rit ia the agint.
But the temperance reformer, sacrificing all h's
nice feelings to benevolence, visits tho outcast of ,
mankind, enters the tottering cabin of the offscouriog
of the world, with clothes in his hand to cover
* h'.s nakedness, and the fatted calf killed to feed his
Hanger; greets him with a soul of lovr, and restores

MR. wehstkk and the treaty.
Wo ropy the annexed article from the
Journal of Commerce, having reason to
believe that in its esxontial features, both
of fact and inference, it is in the main
correct. With us, however, there is no
disappointment that Mr. Webster did not
make a speech at Faneuil Hall on Thure-J-.#
riii.hr sincA uva had no reason to
uaj ' ? |
suppose (hat any meeting was to take
place at that time, or any speech bo delivered.
Not only was the Boston press si.
lent as to arrangement* tor the purposo,
hut we had other reasons to warrant a
contrary belief.. True, indeed, many of
our citizen* were led to suppose that there
was to be a gathering and a speech from
Mr. Webster, by the flourish of trumpets
put forth by the leading total dtpraoily
press. But all tnat, and the parade ol
pretending to send off a corps of report,
era, were merely in the usual course of the
humbug business of that concern.
The Journal, we. apprehend, is wrong
in saying that Mr. Webster visited the
Stato of Maino upon business connected
with the negotiation. . There was a rumor
that ho intended to do so; but we be.
licve that in his journey <-f Jjnc, Mr. j
j Webster went no fa-I her East than Bosj
t?nj
One word more :?While too much
j honor cannot he paid to the Secretary of
State for the great ability with which he
conducted the American side of the ncgo

MR. WKRSTER AND TIIK TRKATV.
i The assembly at Faneuil Hall, Bos.
ton, to greet Mr. Webster and hear a
i speech from him, wa-i expected to take
; place on Thursday night; but the day
was not definitely fixed, and as Mr. Web
ster was so much oppressed by a severe
c.-Idas to be unable to. speak on Thursday,
the matter was postponed, or rather,
not brought on. Mr. Webster will make
a good speech on tho occasion, "we do not
doubt, Tor he; never made any other, diii
what it will he, we cannot exactly foresee.
Mr. Webster has a taken a sort of
Journal of Commerce position that is
a position of his own, independent of all
parties. What he ran say which is like*
ly to to be echoed by the united voice of
the Whigs of Boston, wc do not know.
He agrees with thein on the tariff* qucs*
tion, but the great business of the day,
abusing John Tyler, he will not go into.
He and Mr. Tyler have, lived together on
the most amicable terms. Mr. Webster
has not only not boen thwarted in his do[
parturient hv the President, nor interfered
with, but supported as lib wished. Mr.
Webstor choso to remain in.office when
the other mo libera of the Cabinet retired.
He declared that be saw no necessity for
the disruption. lie has not changed hi*
opinion since ; and although he has given
the President notice of his intention to
retire from office when the news of ihc
ratification of the tre ity lately concluded
with Lord Ashburt ?n shall he received,
his retirement is not based upon any quarrel
or disaffection toward Mr. Tyler.
Under such circumstances, it may he
difficult for Mr. Webster to command the
apulauseof republicans. Ho has indeed,
bv remaining in office, done the country

what of that? He did it by securing
peace: and war only brings eclat. There
is gn at leasoi to bcleive that Mr. WebI

iic was eminently qualified for the task,
and he managed it with consummate wisdom.
In anticipation of the negweiation
he repaired to Massachusetts and Maine,
and lirst of a!l settled the funtlainental
point that the negociati ?u was not to he

brought both parties together, and pro
cmed the commissio iers to be appointed
equally from both. Having thus removed

them. The negociallon of this treaty is

the audience.
The operator then placed hia finger en

with such unrestrained mirthfulneea that
the effect seemed contagious-^the whole

lingly interesting were theeeexperimenta,
that the audience by degree* crowdedforward
until the whole, comprising seme
three hundred, were huddled together in

stage and the first row of seats, there wee
a apace of some eight feet, and in this wno.

grev haired men, such was ths intense in*

The experiments proceeded?the opera*

song. This created great amusement.
Next she was inade to weep and immedi*

be the opinions of this case, the others
were clear enough, admitting the thstfice
of collusion, to prove the truth of Afftento*

wa? concerned.
Tho Richmond Enquirer contains tc*
count of these remarkable phenomena.
A letter from Judge Tucker also appears
in that paper, giving an epitome ef tha ' *
facte of which he was a witness. Tha
experiments were repeated on the fell#*'"

ngcincnt of Dr. Ruchie. 'Chs ^nquirsr^
referring to Judge Tucker's ststaoiaaV
proceeds to give the following account:
We too have read tha letter af Judge
T. with much cart, and pranounes H car*
root, as far ns our memory aerva at, in

ever that both in ine ictis or nihiivr
and phrcno maguttitm, various iImIi
were made by the Rev. Mr. J. to deceive
the me.sinrrizer.?For instance, when bo

tako mere toine; or when vinegar *u of* ?

been touched. Mr. J. whispered to the

mond. la the- Compiler of Tuesday a detailed
account is given of a scries of experiments,
the results of which are indeed <
wonder til. We noticed aorno months <
ago, in some of the Philadelphia, papers,
well authenticated statements narrating ,
similar facts?hut did not allude to them
at the time, preferring to wait until there
should be additional cor.oboration* of ,
such astonishing things. i
We take from the Richmond Complier i
the following extract from it* extended i
statement. The editor was an eye wit*
ncssof what he relates. ,
As introductory to what follows we may (
state, that tho ?uhjoct of Mr. Fronch'sex. i
pcriments was a coloured girl whom he I
had not seen except on the evening before i
at her master's house, where some experiments
in the science had been made. <
On the occasion to which the following i
account refers, a committee of gentle- i
men, selected by the audience, were on |
the platform with tho patient and the ope. i
rator, Tho committee consisted of Judge <
Beverly Tucker, Col. S. H. Parker, and i
Mess. P. R. Grattan, S. H. Gilmer, Wm. I
B. Hamilton, G. A. Myers, and Wm. 8. <
Triplett: i
Mr. French stated that he was no Phre.
nologist, and requested that if any gentletnan
present understood the science he
would come forward and point out the or.
gan* upon the head of the patient. Mr.
Henry Ludlasn, who had boon a student
of the science, came forward accordingly.
First he pointed out the organ of Tune. <
and on the instant the finger of the mes- I
meriscr came in contact with it, the pa
tient began singing in a suppressed tone,
but with remarkable sweetness and in ex- i
cedent time, "The last Roscof Summer." i
While she was singing, the operator, di i
