70, small and irritable. I gave nitrat. r
potass. 2 drm's, caroph. 1 dram, ammo, t
une S. carb. 1 dram, and honey sufficient t
H for u bolus. t
At eight p. m. my patient was in a i
most painfully distressing state. Her i
fore legs were made fixed points, and the i
serratus mignus was called into action 1 |
to assist in respiration. The breathing i
had become stertorous, shoirt, and quick;
the pulse 85, and of that peculiar irritable
kind in which I never abstract blood. I
repeated the medicine as before ordered, J
giving gruel. We watched her till ten j
p. 31., during which time she expressed |
so much pain as would have confounded j
those who think beasts have no feeling. :
Mr. wished me to bleed ber. j
I hesitated; but as she got evidently worse,1
I felt at a nonplus, having cause to know
tr.c ill-effects of phlebotomy, incautiously 1
had recourse to. I therefore expressed a !
wish t<? leave her a short time, thinking a
* ?
change would be more readily perceived
after absence.
In a conversation that followed, men- !
tion was made of the morning drench.? :
A bright flash of hope darted across my
inind, anJ I thought the mystery of her !
affection entirely dissipated. I imparted j
'?Kin-, r?, n tbp nharma- !
IH^ dlKjiltiuua iv/ uiui) iiik ? .... r
cy, and having obtained a lump of cru 1e
.opium, made an impalpable mixture by
rubbing I dram of ti e opium in 4 oz.
boiling water, and adding to it half a pint j
of cold gruel: this I carefully strained, j
end administered to my still intensely
suffering patient.
I could hardly suppress the outburst of |
joy when, in a quarter of an hour after- 1
ward.-, I foit satisfied the patient im- j
proved. I gave immediately a similar,
dose, and at twelve p. m. her breathing1
was comparatively tranquil?her extremi- J
ties had a warmth winch betokened retur- J
ning circulation, and her pulse had sunk j
to 58 I I left two more 1 dram doses j
prepared -as the others, ordering one to be ;
given in two hours' timo, ami the other at j
at six a. m. if the mare did not improve. !,
Tne tiurd <io.>?e was given; and about three ,
a. ax. the mare lay down, and (as they J ,
: told nn ) slept soundly. j'
-* ?-.J saw tier on the next morning about i j
nine o'clock, and felt convinced that my /1
prognosishad been correct. I ordered a j
(11fibrent diet, gave small doses of anti- I j
moniai |?owder, camphor, and digitalis j j
1 made into balls with honey; and in two I (
days she was so far recovered as to require t
no more attention hian Mr. ,
H rcould himself supply. (
About the middle of May, a fortnight (
after the latter case, a chesnut carthorse,; [
5 years old, belongi ng to Mr. , of j j
Ncedham, was brought to our infirmary, j t
Ho had been one long journey at plough,'s
and, being allowed to stand in a pond of!,
water to drink while he was warm, was j
.. immediately seized with shivering and
considerable uneasiness; this was about I,
four p. in. He was baited with the other ,
horses, hut refused his food, and manifes-1
ted increasing uneasiness, in cousequence j j
of which, he was sent to Harlcston (two ' ,
. mile?-), as I have before stated. j,
Having received this information, and , ,
examined him, as well as his warmth from ( j
walkiag would permit, he was bled eight ,
pints, and six 5 oz. aloes Barb, were given ]
to bini in ball. ; . .
Two a. m. A man awoke mc with rei- j
terated hallos and appeals to the knocker. J
lie said the horse was dying, and had ' (
been getting wonc ever since he returned \
home. I immediately attended, and on : ^
examining my patient, found in the case ; j
a a aggravated resemblance to Mr. 's j j
mare. Toe position of the fore exirem-; |
ities was the same, but the pain evinced ! j
was very acute.
Tiie owner had retired to bed, not be. !
ir.g able to endure the sight and denoun. ! i
cirg the propriety of sending for us, as the |
horse was, in his opinion, worth nothing. ]
Having examined the pulse carefully, I t
was more satisfied as to the resemblance i
of the two cases, and immediately gave i
two drachms of opium mixed as before, I
but substituted cold milk in the absence j J
of gruel. A powerful opiate enema was i
administered, and I retired to the house 1
for a short time to await the result. I5e- j i
fore long the carter ran in to say that the j <
horse was better and indeed he was. I j |
gave two drachms more after an hour <
had elapsed, and at hall-past four a. m. t
I had the satisfaction of seeing him lie j ]
down, with a ptil.se which assured me ! (
that I was right in the view I had taken f
of the case. i {
At nine a. m. I called and found the i
I:cr=e still improving. I then ordered an. i j
timoaial powder, camphor, and digitalis j
wilii hone y in a hall; and in four or five (
Cays, after cart ful nursing, he was pro- !
nounced convalescent. f
*Tnc administration of opium in these 4
cases was not the result of having seen it <
so used or recommended, hut from the as- 1 <
|
tonishing sedative action I had observed ; i
to he produced '?v it when given in large :
dos? s 10 hors.ssuffering acute pain from J
various causes, especially enteritis and I
spasmodic cholic. . 1
You may feel surprised at these large '
doses of opium; but in the interitisand in 1
spasmodic cholic I have administered as I
much as from 6 drachms to 1 oz. of crude 1
opium in six or eight hours; and in this 1
my brother, Robert Rush, of South Lop- 1
ham, at least equals if not surpasses me. <
We have been as successful,I should think, 1
us most practitioners in the treatment of 1
enteritis; nor do we find that constipation I
>fthe bowels follows the use of opium, j I
vhich some have written and spoken of. j 1
. have pew ami then witnessed an nppa- 1 1
ent suspension of the intestinal action af- (
er enteritis; hut this is far more likely t
o he the result of the acute inflammation 1
ban the effect of opium; and in this opin- t
on I am supported by the judgment of c
ny father, who has practiced forty-five I
fears, and who has seen death follow this \
paralysis without having used any opi- t
urn. i

This is what is commonly called Coxe's 1

a one of the lie.st remedies in use for t

stomach will bear. It ought not to he f

where the stomach or bowels are very i
irritable. 1
The squill and Seneka may be procured '
from the apothecaries. If, after boding i

water bruised in a mortar and returned, t
the virtues will be more effectually cxtractcd.
The books do not direct so
much boiling as advised aliove, after the

When sufficiently boiled, it keeps an in.! t

Neither this nor any other remedy for ,

is pain in the chest, or when a deep full *

The publishers of daily papers in Savannah
have agreed together to issue their
capers on Sunday morning instead of
Monday morning, as has hitherto been
lie practice in that and all other cities (
n the union. The object of this change 1
s to allow their printers rest on the sab i
>ath. When daily papers are issued on <
Monday morning the work of publication ,
is commonly done on Sunday. A much
tatter change than that adopted in Savan- i j
mih, would be to do the work on Saturday,!
lepositc the papess for the mails in the !
mst office that night, and let those forj
jity sulwcribers lie in the printing office >
ill Monday morning for distribution.?
Merchants,according to thisurrangemcnt,
ould avail themselves of the news as effectually
for business purposes as if the
capers were distributed on Sunday morning.
If the publishers themselves have,
fiot sufficient regard for the divine au-,
horily which ordains the sabbath to be a
lay of rest, to restrain them from the deliberate
and habitual violation of it, they
dill have an interest in maintaining the
;ood order of civil society; and all experi2nee
proves that the public observance
if the sabbath contributes essentially to

On the 16th January, the U. S. Sen.;
itc, on motion of ilfr. Clay of Ky. adop. i '
ted a resolution calling upon the Secreta- j '
ry of the Treasury to communicate aM
jlan of a permanent change in the Tariff,! (
the details and general principles of! <
ivhich he said, in his annual report, he ; (
was prepared . to furnish wheneverj
:alled upon to do so. The Secretary,"in j
reply, takes decided ground in favor ofj"
adhering to the compromise of 1833.? '
According to the TarifT act then passed,'{
he duties on all articles are to be reduced 11
to 20 per cent ad valorem in 1842 and al- 1
though it is, on it* face, simply an act of (
Congress, repealable like other acts yet
he Secretary reasons at considerable
ength to prove that the intention at the
into was to make a permanent reduction
)f imposts to 20 per cent,unless the income
rom such a tariff should fall short of the
vants of the government. He estimates
he deficiency of revenue likely to occur
n 1842, when the provisions of the act of
1833 shall go fully into operation, at
?5,000,000, unless the expenditures of the
Government should be reduced; which lie
is of opinion may be done. lie proposes
to meet this deficiency by imposing duties
an articles now admitted free, or at less
than 20 percent; and selects for this purpose,
chiefly, articles of luxury; such as,
iilks, tea, coffee, lines &c.
The debate in the U. S. Senate on the
land bill continues with unabated interest.
Among those who have, within a few
lays spoken on the subject, are Messrs.

if Agriculture. The calm and indepenlent

one of thesrongest conservative
influences in our country, invest
vith groat importance all attempts to operate
upon t hat class of our citizens. And
then too there are the almost incalculable
resources of national power and

by the practical application of the

like these, (and there arc many

abject. Of these the conductors of the
' American Farmer" are the earliest
ind among the most constant and suejcssful.
The editor is a gentleman of
*reat intelligence and cherful good humor
?and both he and the publisher have exhibited
a uniform and almost enthusiastic
ievotion to the agricultural interests of
the country. Although published at Bal.

extent in the West and Southwest.
Although on the confines of the
tree states, it is the friend of southern institutions.
The very low price at which it
is furnished (only $2,50 per annum) puts
it within the reach of every one who has
the disposition to read it. Its eight neatly
printed pages come to its subscribers
each week with commendable regularity,
not to create or foster a feverish and painful
anxiety by speculations on the slate of
Exchange and the money market, nor to
provoke the temper with the ill natured
calumnies of political partizanship, but
fraught with the useful results of enlightened
experiment on every imaginable
interest of the farmer?modes of cultivation,
selection of seed, breed, and
treatment of stock, agricultural implements
&c. In a country like ours, the diffusion
of correct political information
and instruction is very important and yet
I am sure that both the happiness and
the real interest of many persons would
be promoted by substituting the "Farmer"
' for some one of their political papers, if
they cannot afford to add it to them.

CONGRESS.
Washington, Jan, 20.
The pre-emption bill, which has so long
been debated in the Senate, was to-day
ordered to be engrossed for a third reading?30
to 17.
In the course of the discussion, it was
asserted by Mr. Buchanan, Mr. Clay of
Ala. and others, that Gen. Harrison was
in favor of the pre-emption bill. He formerly,
as it was said, supported a bill that
went the whole length, and, last summer,
in a letter to a New-Orleans editor, he
| declared himself in favor of the doctrine.; d
Mr. Buchanan remarked that he would j t<
predict that, when the distribution bill: p
became a law?as he thought it would j
under the new administration?the pre-,
emption system would be combined with ! 11
it. In the bill as brought forward in i n
1839 this principal was fully embraced. ! s<
There were several attempts to adjourn, i P
in order to continue the debate to-mor-j f
row, but Mr. Sjviersaid it had never been I L
possible to get a pre-emption bill through | ^
by daylight. It was late when the Sen- j,
ate adjourned. I
Much of the debate was on subjects ex- i
[ traneous to the bill. The subject of the r
| revenue was introduced. Mr. Buchanan a
| stated, that, from letters and other sour- t
i ccs, he was inclined to believe that the I
j revenue from customs in 1841 would be c
equal to nineteen millions. He had no
disposition he said, to embarrass the new s
administration, and believed that they
; would find an ample Treasury, when they ,
! came into power. t
Mr. Clay said he had no reason to be- g
licve that the revenue from customs would j f
j be large. But he had no means of judg-1 c
I ing except from the last year. He would I
i nninf. linwpvfir. to the suDnlomentary re- 11
I , ... 11
port of the Secretary of the Treasury, in j t
which he estimates the receipts for the j
first quarter of the present year, at only J p
j three millions. j1
In the House, the Treasury Note bill *
was taken up, and Mr. Bell occupied the . [
day in a long speech on the subject.
He would vote for any bill that the Ad- j'
ministration chose to bring forward?for j j
on them rested the responsibility. He
would not prefer the form chosen by them
: for replenishing the Treasury, but he
I would vote for the necessary supplies in j
j such form as the administration thought j (
I proper. He did not believe that the five i
j millions, provided in this bill, would be i
sulficicnt. He regretted that a more I
! ample provision was not made. He did i?
j not believe that the friends of the admin- J
! istration would bring forward any bill, 1
making further provision; and, therefore, j1
the new administration would be nnder j
the necessity of convening Congress im- j1
mmediatcly in order to provide means for ,
keeping the government in motion.
T.iis debate is likely to last a fortnight.
Tae Van Buren members, so far as I learn
are opposed to raising more than five .
1 millions by Treasury notes. They say
they could get along with that sum, and
! the Whig administration must take the !
responsibility of raising more.
Washington, Jan. 21.
Mr. Adams resumed to-day, and in spite
of the rules, iiis o'd vocation of presenting j
abolition petitions. One of them from 1
Pennsylvania, embraced several subjects,!
some of which were objection able, but
wound up with praying the abolition of
j slavery in the District of Columbia. The ;
j Speaker inadvertantly rcccivjd and refer
j red the petition, but its character being j
I j immediately detected. It was nailed to j
j the counter. A warm discussion arose as ,
| to the question whether the petition, or |
any part of it, could be received, and others
that the whole should be rejected. The
hour expired before the question could he
decided.
Tne Treasury note bill was taken up
nnd Mr. VV v ddv Thompson made a sens- |
iblc and animated speech upon it. lie
concurs with Mr. Bell, Mr. Evans and
others, in the opinion that the revenue for
j 1841 will not equal the necessary and ordinary
expenditures by ten or fifteen millions,
and he spoke in favor of an imposition
of duties on luxuries.
Mr. Riigtt followed chiefly in reply to !
Mr. Evans, undertaking to vindicate the '
I
Secretary of the Treasury from the lrn- '
putation of having m.ide under and de- I
ccptive statements, and contending that
the estimates for 1841 were correct, full
and adequate.
A difference of opinion arose between
Mr. IIiiett and Jonf.s, on one side, and
Mr. Evans on the other, as to the charges
on the Treasury during 1841 on account
of the Florida War. Mr. Evans states
that there are now employed in Florida
1700 men, without authority of law, but
which force must be provided for and paid !
during 1841; that the Secretary takes no .
notice of this charge ; half a million was
due on account of this force when Mr.
Woodbury's report was made ; that a |
million is now due ; and that a million and
a half more will become due in the course ;
of the year, if the force be retained
. in the service. All these facts were dis|
pitted, and the communications on the
r subject from the Secretary of War were
. ordered to he printed. The House ad- |
. journcd, leaving Mr. RiiKTTiu possession J
of the floor for to morrow,
j There seems to be no doubt that the
whig members are united in a determina.
tion that tho new administration shall not
be bothered for want of money ; and that,
therefore, a special session of Congress
will hp snnn en I led hv General HaRRISON.
The whigs deny that the estimate of nine|
teen millions for the ordinary expenditures
of 1841 is adequate by ten millions ; and
further, they doubt whether the estimated
receipts will be forthcoming.
In the Senate, the pre-emption bill was
again the subject of debate, but the dis.
cussion run into the present financial :
condition of the treasury. Mr. Wkbsteh
made a powerful speech in favor of pre:
emptioni
The Europoan stockholders in the Pennsylvania
Hank of the United States having

Jed her with specie funds to the further
amount of a million of pounds, it is believed
that the institution will stand firm, and

securities can be realized.

ixed upon, will be a source of much in:onvenience
to the President, for it will

The Chinese,-Mr. Ciiin-lin,?now on ,
i visit to this city, attracts much attenion.
He was in the Senate chamber,
o-day, listening, very gravely, to the elojucncc
of Mr. Buchanan. He dresses
n full Chinese costume, is very easy and
)o!ile in his address, and is thoroughly iglorant
of the English language. It is a
Hrirriianre. nevertheless, with which his
O ?O '
jountrynien are likely now to be made
icquanted, and much to their cost.
Mr. Rhett made a speech in the House,
;a-day, on tu Treasury Note Bill, and ^
Jemonstrated that the provision made by
;he present administration, tor the expenditures
of 1841 was ample, a'>d would, in
fact, leave a surplus of one or two millions
it the end of the year.
Mr. Ncsbit, of Ga. spoke in favor of
the bill, arid was willing to admit thedelieicncy
in the revenue. He was in favor
of providing for this deficiency by a
duty on wines, s.Iks, and other luxuries, .
now free of duty; and it would be no
breach of the compromise act, in his opinion,
to enforce those duties prior to 1842.
He thought it t!io policy and duty of the
South to adhere to the compromise art,
and he held it to be binding after 1842.
The most, valuable principle of that act
was that, after 1842, there should be uo
protective duties.
It may bo renurked that the above is
not the So ith-Carolina doctrine. The
South-Carolinians hold, as I understand,
tiiat the compromise is not obligatory on
Congress, any more th?n any other or
dinary act of legisla'ion; ami, regarding a
protective tariff as unconstitutional, they
seek shelter from its oppressions under the
Constitution, and not under any legislative
act.
In the Senate, the Pre cmp:ion bill was
still under discussion,?the quest on being
on Mr. Crittenden's motion to recomm t
the bill with instructions to substitute for
it a bill embodying'(tar two principles of
pre emption and distribution.
The discussion, however, consisted entirely
of political recriminations between
tWr. Buchanan and Mr. Crittenden. They
discussed the merits and demerits of the
two great parties, and the principles of
the o.it-going and the in-coming administrations.
? . _
Mr. Calhoun has the floor to-morrow?
and will probably speak chiefly in opposition
to the Distribution bill..
Mr. Webstej, though in favor of preemption,
made a most able argugnnt yesterday,
in support of tfce distribution
scheme. I presume Mr. Calhoun intends
to reply to that argument.
Correspondence of the Journal of Commerce. *
Washington, Saturday Jan. 23.
The grand debate on* the financial policy
of the government which is now going
on, in both Houses of Congress, is unquestionably
the most interesting and important
that has ever taken place since the
organization of the government.
d o
The sudject before the Senate is the
distribution of the proceeds of the public
lands, and, in the House, the Treasury
note bill is under consideration; but, in
both Houses, the discussion now runs into
the same great question, as to our policy
in regard to the public lunds, the tariff,
national and state debts, state rights, and
a national bank.
For the last two or three days, the debate
in the Senate has assumed a new
and most interesting form. It has- not
consisted of set speeches, as in the House,
but Senators have met each other, in extemporaneous
and condensed argument,
and the warmth of the collision has elicited
more of really Senatorial eloquence
than was ever displayed in that body since
my recollection. As one proof of this*

powerful, and eloquent, in his unpremeditated
speech of Thursday evening.
Mr. Crittenden, Mr. Wright and Mr.
Webster, were scarcely ever more happy
and impressive than in the off hand debqte.
of the same day.
This morning, Mr. Calhoun opened the
discussion with a truly splendid speech, *
reply chiefly to the condensed argument
offered by Mr. Webster on Thursday evening,
and Mr. Webster who was thqs
suddenly and unexpectedly called upon
to defend his positions, made a most masterly
reply,?perhaps the moeT successful
effort he ever made on that floor. ,
He commenced jn a cool and dispassionate
manner, stating his argument in
the plainest and briefest form. Ultimately,
he pame to a more general view of the
question, particularly as regards the present
condition of the several States; and
here he rose to the highest or^cr of clor
