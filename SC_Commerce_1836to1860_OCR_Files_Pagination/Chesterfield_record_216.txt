EXECUTIVE DEPARTMEUT, ;
L ? November 27, 1838.
FeVew Citizens of the Senate and
House of Representatives,
$nce your i.?st meeting we have had rcu.
son-to be gratefulfor many blessings of a
kind Providence. With one unfortunate)
exception, every quarter of the State has
been fivoured ovith an unusual share of
health : and the industry of her citizens in
the cuhire of the soil is rewarded, if not
with an overflowing harvest, with enough
at least to satisfy their reasonable desires.
In the dsfress and embarrasmen's of the
nns* it is to bo hoped they have learned a
r -- .
lesson of frugality and prudence for the tulure.
Tc husband w til economy and enjoy
wi;h moderation, is the best return we j
can make to the Dispenser of good for the
favours whici His wisdom has conferred.
When we vere lately convened under
these walls, the hand of affliction was heavy
upon us. 'Enterprise was palsied, Commcrce
was prostrated, the circulation, the
life-blood of Commerce, was tainted with
insecurity and disorder. Our agricultural
interest felt deeply the general distraction :
its products were depreciated to a degree
that left to the dispiri ed planter a bare ro^
muoeration for his toil. I am happy now
to join with you in rejo:cing at the commencement
of a better state of things. We
have weathered the gale and the sun shines
again: clieerfulnossand confidence are restored.
Credit is re-estnblished ; the Banks
iiavo resumed the punctual fulfilment of
their obligations; trade has returned with
life and vigour to its wonted channels, and
our crops, reinstated in value, are again be.
come a fund of prosperity and wealth.
The Bank of the State, well and judicious.
|y cpnducted, continues as heretofore,
to be a source of advantage to the people,
and pro-fit and convenience to the country.
For a full and detailed statement of the affairs
of this Institution, I beg leave to refer
you to the President'* report, which is nerewith
submitted. Ttie nett profits of the
last year are one hundred and ninety-six
thousand five hundred and thirty dollars,
($196,530.) A great impediment to the
freedom of its operations, has been removed*
by the general resumption of specie payments.
For the condition of the finances of the
Si^te,and of the surplus revenue teceived
from the General Government, you are respectfully
referred to the report of the Comptroller,
general
Of the affairs of the State Banks generally,
I have obtained returns, the substance
of which is presented to your consideration
in a condensed report, The result is that
they are prosperous and safe, well entitled
to your approval, and to the confidence of
the community.

The care of the State Militia includes a
large share of the duties of your Executive.
I have therefore held it throughout the term
of my service, in especial regard, and have
wa'ched with much solicitude the operation
of the several provisions you have made for
ihe improvement,of this important arm of
defence. . I have reviewed every Regi.
ment of Infantry in the State, (46 in number,)
and six-out of the seven Regiments
of Cavalry.''
To the much wit and sarcasm thatingen.
uily has arrayed against the Militia service,
it would be quite out of place here to answer.
The soldier of twelve days in a year, will
hardly be compared, in skill or discipline,
with the soldier by profession, and by the
practice of a lifetime ; but if t e best mill,
tia are only very imperfect soldiers, what
would you expect from the worst ? And
let it be remembered that, good or bad, ig.norunt
or intelligent, spirited or without 1
spirit, as your wise or earless legislation j
'nrinv ? OLnt tho f*i milifin nrfl still VOUr '
only means of protection. In the appeal to 1
force, which every state pretending to the s
character of independence, must be prepar. F
ed to m?et, they are your only argument, J
und you must make the most of it. The > ti
militia are not unimprovable. They have ti
improved and are improving. In many o
parts of the country the Militia are every :i
th:ng that could be reasonably desired. This lo
excellence has generally been the result of A
the spirited exertions of individual officers, ei
whose zeal and activity deserve to be eu- sf
courageJ * by the Representatives of the \\
lS ate. \Wn this species of public service R
.shall bo rewarded with its proper measure m
of approbation, the difficulty will at once m
cease of maintaining a well organized milL ih

The system of encampments has wrought i its
'??r hftcn SUO ' rv!
i 111 *?agw 1 i
that the inconvt niences still arising from <2e- rot
fects in an experiment compara'ively new, is i
should only urge us to a diligent inquiry for i he
the means to obviate them. In this spirit j wc
I beg leave to recommend to your consid.
oration, 1st, the purchase of a suitable pa. an
rade ground for ?ach brigade ; and 2nd, the of
issue of rations to officers attending encamp. th<
ments. The first ot these propositions, Cc
though apparently of little importance, will nu
be of essential advantage in effect. At pres. wl
ent the convenience or caprice of individuals to
may at any moment defeat the orders of to
the Commander in Chief, and frus rate the CI
intentions of the Law. The adopiion of M
this measure will also "give an air of perma. hi
nence to the system: The issue of rations to
will relieve considerably the burthen or'pri- ?r
vateexpense, in attending theencampments, cc
and will initate the soldier into a depart h<
mei.t of military affairs which it is some. ; sc
what 'important he should understand. It 1 m
will also tend to the better ordering of th? ! th
?r>,l .. ui t!w> onfirrina nf'tn
uuu in luv/ruiu w j ,?
discipline. Estimates are herewith submit, j b<
ted et the probible expense of this prov s-j to
ion, which is in my opinion too small to be ! w
weighed against its many advantages. I. i tit
is also very desirable for the perfecting of ; g<
our military system, that a digest should be |
made of tho Militia Laws,suited rather for \ p(
the instruction of officers, than the refer- pj
ence of lawyers. The Adjutant and Inspcctor
General presents a combination of (|j
education and talent especially well adap- ai
ted to such a service.?For this purpose m
the Adjutant General might without mator- tc
ial prejudice to his other duties, be relieved g
for one year, from atttcndancc on the re. {Q
views. jc
In regard to our fire arms and other mil., j ^
ni'ions of war, circumstances have induced
me to institute a thorough examination; jp
which has resulted in the conviction, that C)
we should depend as far as possible Lr our Sl
supply of these articles on ourselves, or on ; ?
source.- witkin our controul. I have the ! ^
ViAnnp tn QiiVmif tn vnn thp renort of a Board '
."".w. ? - r ; j in
of Inspecto-s, appointed to examine the 0
arms and emmunition belonging to the ?
State, in the arsenal at Charleston. It ap- j (j
pears that' he ammunition obtained generally i
from abroad,is not to be trusted in, frequent-:.
I ly containing peas and corn, instead of]ir
i buckshot and the like frauds. The j v
I Muskets? as well thoso imported from j
j England, and from the North, as from ! S(
| the I'nited States factories?are, for the j
j most part, good for nothing, and dan- | ^
gerous. T ie old Cartridges have by ; ^
I my] order been all broken up, and a full "
I supply, of very superior quality, has
; been prepared by Captain Charles Parker, S'
! of the Magazine Guard, at Charleston ; but tr
| in regard to the arms, I have been able to 0
; do nothing mote than exercise extreme vig- ?!
j ilancc in purchasing. It is due to the Uni- Ir
'*'1 dmn.nmnnt BP If IM1 I r?/?rrf? thnt "
f ICU Uiai^-5 kV wvnuvif ivvi^w uiwb .
! the objectionable arms received from their
! factories were oromptly exchanged foroth- i'
j crs. These last have not yet been thorough- 1
11 y inspected, bat there is reason to fear that a
; they are much better than those returned. e'
The affairs of the College are in a condi- ?'
fion to fulfil the best wishes of its friends. .4
This Institution has exercised a vast iiiflu. u<
\ or
ence over the character of the State, and I .
believe is destined to be its palladium of CI
safety, amidst the popular commotion which e-'
too frequently agitates all free States. The w
knowledge acquired, and the friendships m
contracted here, will be stronger than pop- 0
ular violence. Those who hive formed
good opinions of each other when they were ^
associated together in the intimacy of unre- ,
served communication, will retain and cul- ,
tivate a spirit of liberality and forgiveness, (
even in the heat9 of political hostility. Our
wise and prudent ancestors could not have
devised a more noble and effectual means T.a
of perpetuating their glorious influence over
the destinies of their country, than, by the
establishment of an Institution of literature m
and science, under the fostering care of the m
State, in which their precepts would be
valued, and their examples appreciated.? - 1
This Institution should be a primary object .0I
of State policy and popular pride. It is the J?1
Institution of the people, and for the people. (
It is theie they must acquire the inteliigence fl,.j
to govern themselves. The Legislature ,.
should not hesitate to make any nppropria- V
tion which the interests of the College may
require. The number of students is rapid. L
ly increasing, and is now far beyond any ex'
former precedent. The present number is 2el
about 170, and it will probably be necessa. SUJ
rv, before long, to make a still father addi. or^
tion to the buildings, for their comfortable as
accommodation. The Library though res -v
pectablo, cannot, be compared with several Pr(
attached to other Universities in the United ac|
States. Great scholars and erudite writers
must have access to full libraries, to maka C01
their labors useful, and their productions pec
accurate. The S:a:e should take a pride 'n 1
in affording this facility to them by having out
a Library which will give it an interest in
tbe estimation of posterity, and in the eyes i rat*
of intelligent foreigners. With a view of 'cor
attaining this end, I beg leave to recommend I 'ne
to the Legislature an annual appropriation, 1
for the purchase of books for the College
Library. and
The Free School System, as nt present m0'
conducted, does not appear to fulfil the belevolent
purposes intended to be effected Pra<
Dy its establishment. I would recommend t,m<
he appointment of a Board of Commis- deal
doners to enquire into this subject, and re? UP<?
>ort to the next Legislature. ecti<

It is the privilege of an intelligent and vir
nous people, that the force of its Legisla. | P .
on may be diverted, from the mere defence
f the life and liberty of the citizen, to the
nprovement of his property, a?d the en- P^'"
irging of his means ot enjoying life.? u
.mongst the noblest examples of this ex- res *
cise of legislative wisdom, stands the an a
dendid project of comn unication with the jP
fest, overleaping the barrier of the Blue j 1
idge. Cost what it may, South Carolina ve^e
ust achieve this work. Socially com- Portercinlly,
politically interested as she is in 0
e cementation of Southern interests, she Tl

frits interesting paper, I have the honor: c;

(Neill, in reply to inquiries addressed to v
n, on several important points, in regard a
vhich his ability and professional skill are rI
titled to the highest authority. With the q
nfidence of full knowledge and experience, p
.'pronounces on the practicability of'tlio p
heme, in a shorter tima, at a cost more a
oderate, and with more abundant profits, j s
HQ many even of its well wishers have veil.! il
red to anticipate. But whatever might I c
2 the expense or difficulty, we have gone ; c
o far, we have promised too much to ?ho j v

Since the publication of the Annual Re- u
)rt of ihe Direction of the Rail Road C'oni- >'
tny. the South Western Rail Road Bank S
is been organized, and will go info imme- d
ate operafion, under the most favorable "
ispiccs, and with every prospect of pro- j j'
iDting the success of the great enterprise j "
1 which it is intended to be auxiliary. The ; 0
ank must be of inestimable value, as well j
the stock holders, as to the country. Act. ; )'
ig under this impression, and desirous that, c
ic S;ate might not lose her privilege of s
irtia'pating in the Revenues of the Bank, h
that policy should be approved of, 1 con- q
sived it to be my duty, in concurrence? with ti

Following in the same spirit ofdomestic, P
nproverr.ent, which you have wisely led, I J
enture to suggest to your consideration, a '
jeasure fcr the developement of our re. *
jurces which does not appear to have been .
) much tppreciated by us. as by other I
tates of equal intelligence. Extensive j n
Geological Surveys have been instituted, j 0
nder Iegisativc sanction, in most of the .
few Eng'and States, in New York, Pcnn. "
idvania, and Virginia. Besides the con. 0
ibution to Science, the direct advantage ?
f these investigations, ha9 been so obvious 1
3 to diminish the expense, by comparison r<
ito almost :io'hing.?The Mineral res
uroes of each section of -country have l)
p;en brought 'o light, and made available. ^
lines of buried wealth, of every description, f
ave been exp.ored, their, qualties aseer. 's
lined, and their uses pointed out. The
Hthausted soil of Lower Virgiaia has found
i elixir of new life in her long neglected
ids of Lime and M rl. Even the Gran- v
? Rocks of Massachusetts have been clas- R
id, and each variety examined, and pre? J a
scly located. The fruit of this enlight. | P
led labor is seen in the blocks of masonry i ~
hich have been brought over a thousand n
ii!cs of Occean, to adorn even the streets j*
F Charleston. But, as I propose raiher to
Ivise with you, than to direct your conn. 0
fls, J leave this bare suggestion to your "
itter intelligence. I will only remark, that i.
e survey instituted some years since, un- J
ir the charge of Professor Van Uxem,
as rather mineralogical than of a general
Jological character, and therefore tended j
ther to entertain the curious, than to enjhten
the steps of practical indus'ry.
Upon the general condi ion of our com_ J.
on highways, it is hardly necessary to re.
ark. That it cannot possibly be muc!:
arse is I believe generally acknowledged, j .
lit Road Laws are very impefectly en-1
reed, and the system appears to be very j
innrfiv?? in if colt*. Thti uneoual distribu- i _*
'I'VtlWVk *" 1 n|
?n of the labour, the unskilfulness of the g
perintendents, and the manifest interest of
who are snbject to road duty to do as
tie of it as possible, are defects very suffi-1
?nt to account for its miserable success, j g
it, as the Legislature has more than once
pressed its disinclination to attempt any
aernl reform in this matter, 1 will only
?^est the propriety of encouraging the
janizat o i of private turnpike companies
well by the grant of liberal charters, as
participating in their expenses and Pr
in such proportion as to secure their ??
ive co-operation. ^
The condition of our navigable water- w
irscs naturally suggests itself in this con. (Q
:tion. Large sums have been expended
their improvement, but heretofore with. Jan
adequate return ;?perhaps, because cQ
system was not vigoriously followed up,
ler than from having been injudiciously Jje
nmenced. The Broad River is a prom,
nt illus ration of this?ono of our streams pd(
lie largest class, dividing the centre of ^
State. Between the Columbia Canal
! Lockhart's shoal, and thence to the;
jth of King's Creek; in York District, i
e are several rapids, at low water im. wa
:ticable for the smallest craft, and at all ^
2S diflicult and dangerous. A good ,
[oflabor lias already been expended en(
n these obstructions ; but frotn the er- pu|
on of Dams, and the casual disturbance ftJj
le bed of the stream, added to tlie im- gys
'ections of the original work, the navL I ,'u{
on is becoming annually more difficult.! -p[

To enable the Legislature to ap, ly | yVt
dequate remedy to this evil, it will per..! wjtj
! be odvisuble to cause this and such j vcs'(
of our Rivers as demand it, to bo sur- j je(j

^ere are many subjects connected with I ofoi
Iriminal Code which urgently demand adaj
Mention of the Legislature. Among Hers
is the hab't of wearing concealed -con'
jadily weapons, which has become too w
immon among ihc more unthinking part ef
' the community. This practice is highly
iprehensible, offensive to good taste, sub. pt
?rsive of the peace of theccuntry, and un. m
orthy of an advanced stage of christian th
vilization. Revenge and resentment are rc
ad counsellors under any circumstances, hi
r for any age ; but, when they operate on
outliful inexperience, they have a peculiar- n<
r baneful and mischievievous effect. To p<
arry secret weapons for an unarmed ad- 01
ersury to be used on an anticipated occas- al
ion, is but to arm revenge; and to pro- pi
idc them against a ensu ij eniergehcy, is to
fiord a criminal temptation to resentment- hi
Die transient ebullition of passion thus fre- hi
neatly results in the commission of irre. 1
arable crime. This vulgar and unmanly m
ractice should not only be discountenanced, hi
sis by the virtuous and intelligent part of S
oci?'ty. but it should in some way be inhib. w
>-wi Kt, I<?to1 oif>s?tiri<*iiTc- If would not Si
iVU UJ lO^UI \,l?>IVIll*w...w. .V .. w-.- ^
icrhaps be proper to prohibit tin; wearing f<a
f weapons about the person. Such a law ir
you'd he impracticable from the difficulty p
nd odium of enforcing it. But when death 01
nsues from the use of concealed weapons, o
a a contest which commenced apparently; ri
pon equal terms, it might be, and I think o
should be regarded ns a capital felony.
?uch a law, however, should be well guard, i b
ed, to exempt it from objections. In male, k
lg these remarks, I am but conforming to a
m presentments of grand juries, and to the c
idicntions of public opinion, in every part V
f the State. a
Another subject to which I would invite h
our attention, while engaged in the consid. r<
ration of the criminal laws, i3 the trial of e
laves, especially in capital cases. These a
rials are frequently conducted inobscur*
uarters of country, remote from observu?n,
by ignorant mm, frequently excited a
>y timidity, or immoderate resentment, ir
The consequence is that there is more de- a
aand for executive interposition ia this class C
f cases, than in any other; and probably ti
here are many instances of gross cruelty tr
nd injustice, which are never heard of out n
f their neigeborhood. This evu might '1
erhaps be remedied, in part, by requiring te
11 trials of this character to be held at the ti
2ourt Honseof each District respectively, h
it nnv rate hum initv reouires that some- i g
"" J " V - ?
hing should be done. g
With a view to elicit information which ci
night be useful to the Legislature, I have d
btained from the Sheriffs and Clerks of the n
Courts ofeach District, their several opinnns
in regard to the existing defects of their
fficos, besides a list of the indictments,
onv:c:ions, &c.; which have occurcd in
ie last two years, of which a condensed
sport is sabraitted. -j
The tribe ofCatawba Indians, holding a
Leserve of fifteen miles quire of land on the ^
latawba River, in York District, among j
ie most ferule in the State, is daily dimin.. tj
thing, and is already reduced to the num- j(
er of about sixty or eighty. The revenue 0
erived by the Indians from the Lease of
ieir Lands, is received in a form tn be of
ery little advantage to them ; while ut the
ame^time, the title of the whites is utis titled,
nd the State isder.ving no revenue from a (j
roductive section of her territory. This ^
ubject appears to demand invesigation,
nd is introduced to your notice at the sohcuion
of parties interested in its adjustment. | ?
J A U f- il.A nnnntntmOlll i
recomm^nu, uicrciurcy iiig oppwiuu"*'""
f a commission to ascertain and report
pon the facts. The conduct of our State u
nvards the Indians, has, from the beginning S(
eon a pleasing feature in her history ; and (j
umanity unites, with an honorable pride, ^
i demanding that full justice should be se. te
ured to this last remnant of the original f(]
olders of soil. ,e
Such are the suggestions arising out of fj.
n earnest use of those facilities of observa- fc
on afforded by my official posit'on. They ^
re yoursubmitted to superior wisdom, with j(
ly full confidence that, however our opinms
may chance to differ upon details, we ?

Direct Foreign Trade.
These shackles of Northern Trade of w
liich wc have latterly heard so much,
oceed, from causes not so easily over- cc
me. The North is much indebted to tr
t natural advantages, but she owes more in/
the liberal employment of the credit sys- al
oT. This enabled her at an early period ve
commence a generous rivalry with Euro- q0
an commerce and manufactures. This ho
rnishftd her the means of shin-buildinff? ho

ary description. These objects (except tra
mmerce) were greatly fostered by the imj
ir, subsequently by the tariff, and after- am
rdsby the money thrown into her circu- of i
on by the payment of tho public debt, it, j
Dur course was vastly different; our dec
jrgies were directed to the great p?\
suits of agricultural life. Always fear- lish
of over,banking we employed the credit sett
tem for no valuable imp evemcnt. Our are
Jc was originally mostly with Europ#.? min
ere we shipped our products and receiv- ser,
in return manufactured goods to supply tizic
our wants. Gradually,chowever, our the

i began to find that there wc could meet vail
i foreign goods, imported in Northern ene
jels and by nothern capital, which, ad? circ
to their own manufactures of greater and
;nt and variety, ard actually cheaper! of a
rice than we had been importing direct- J bcc<

The city of New York possesses naturr
ivantages so greatly superior io any othe
art in die United Slates that she ha3 nc

reater or less degree.
To build up home markets is eeitiinl;
igbly desirable and of primary importance

uch as have enabled the North to compel
ith Europe. We must extend the cred
fsiem; affbid the means to erect manu
ictories to buiid ships, to improve our nat
union, open canals and cons:iuct turr
ikes and railways to improve and us
ur water power, and to work the mines <
res and minerals with which our State s
chiy abounds ; ayl we must do what i
f paramount imp^ance, erect Seminarie

etter to improve our natural advantage?, t
eop the children of the rich at home an
void he extra vnganr expense and the ui

omo, and, finally wc must do as ourbretl
sn of the North do, slay at homo ourselve

broad, an I ceaso to spend our timo i
lleness and extravagance.
We should forbear |o cul ivate sectiont
nd geographical feelings. There isdangc
i if. It is enough to keep the line ofrigtn
nd attachments between the State an
General Governments separate and dit
net. The object of our compact wa
ade, friendly intercourse and strenghth (
umbers ; and I should learn with rcgrc
le incipiency of any measure that woul
ind a plant a hitter rivalry or angry aliena
on between the North and South. VV
ave but one peculiar Southern interest t
uard, and that is sufficient to bind us tc
ether with chains of adamant. We lookw t
onndence to ttic uonsmuiion tor proiecno
jcrc, and when that fails the South as on
tun will know how to protect herself.
National Currency.
A circulating medium of uniform valu

The leading design of these grants ti
longrcss was, to render what was befor
regu'ar, uncertain and deranged, certain
^fincd and uniform; otherwise there cout
e no precision, no uniformity, and but lit
s justice in the collection of taxes and du

ut the grant "to regulate commerce witl
reign powers, with the States and Indiai
ibes," indicates very strongly the intentioi
'the framers of the cons itution upon th
ibject, and their sense of the necessity nn<
oprietv of regulating the currency, be i
hat it may.
A national bank being considered un
institutional by the present Chief Magis
ate, cannot, of course, be established dor
? bis term of office, unless a constitution
majority can be obtained to control thi
to power, of which I confess I entertair
i hope. The necessities of the countr)

tas been made the stalking horse of the
magogue, and made to bear upon all our
ictions, from the elevated chief magisto
to the humble constable ; and yet, so
pressed was the country with ita utility

the late President, who was opposed to
t was re-chnrtered by Congress by deci1
majorities, and fell a victim to the veto
ver. The rnnsMtutionalitv of 1 es'ub
iment seems to be a question never to be
led; and if the scenes of its re-charter
always to be jcted over and the public

and agitations of corrupt partes,
it may well be questioned whether
advantages of such an institution, high- \
.s I might value them, uro, not counter- f
ed by the improper uses to which ift!

fy preferences are with tyd Banks off
States ; and I ask your attention to,.and
cand d consideration 6\\ my reasons.;
i:r normanencv is an jfonortati? reoom/
J
i- mendation. The first chartered banks 1
the country are yet in existence and in good^^k
d credit, and no one within my. knowledge,"^^L
o of respecrable standing, has ever been re*
d fused o re.charter when applied for. Nn- ^|l
i* tionaI politics have never entered into their
s management; and their contradicts and
expansions can never affect the business
d of the country like a national bank of largo
f capital ramifying ?nio many States.
A considerable reformation, alteration
Y and improvement would be necessary, how0
ever, in order to make the local banks
meet my views. Tltey ore at present too
y numerous; their capitals generally loO
? small; ana me vuneiy 01 nvir uvic? ?v
" great :hat it is almost impossible to fix upon
e tae memory the churacter of the signatures
18 ami vignettt-s, so as to avoid ihe danger of
5# forgeries. Some of their locations arc in;e
convenient as depositories; it will inevitably
11 lead to rivalry and dissatisfaction, jealous*
ies, and more than all, to a depreciation of
r* j the issues of the rejected banks.
* j 1 propose, then, that our State lead the
?j way in the reform of our banking system,
^ and respectfully recommend the chartering
? of a Bank with a capital of ten millions of
19 dollars, allowing the existing Banks to sub*
!S scribe all their capital stock into it; the re*
10 maining stock to be taken by individuals?.
? into the detai's of which i? is not necessary
d now to enter.
l" The Stale to transfer all its stock and
' funds to the Bank, and to offer its services
!s to the federal government as a depository o!
11 its funds, the safety and forlh-coming of
'* of which, in the kind of money deposited, to
* be guaranteed bv the State in such manner
,s as shall be satisfactory to the general govn
erament. And, in the event of the Bank
being unable to meet the payment of tlio
dcpositcs of the general government, tho
!r State to issue stock for the amount in favor
3 of the government, bearing 5 per cent, in*
^ terest, until the Bank is able to resume pay*
ment.
,s For these services rendered to t;e gencral
government, the notes issued by the
Bank to he received in payment of ill its
d dues : and on the further condition that tho
- nthflr States nrenare their Banks in like
" r~ i ? .
e manner and for like purposes, namely: That
0 each Stale and Territory shall designate by
'* law one bank, and moro, if its trade and
h necessities require it, of capitals not exceed.
n ing ten nor less tlmn two millions of dollars,
e as its own depos'tory an J the depository of
' the general government; and, if requested
by the President of the U. States, other
o i Wanks for that purpose. A second Bank,
|. however, in no case to be chartered or deg
signaled, un'il the capital of the first, which
i. shall be the maximum amount, shall bo en*
_ irely taken ; and so on 'o the third, f >urtl?
j. and fifth, when necessary. The notes of all
y the Banks thus made depositories to be en.
i. graved on similar paper, and to be made to
i. resemble each oilier as nearly as possible.
a j Each State shad designate to Congress
ri i 'he particular Bank tendered as a depositoi.

i shall be transferred to a depository of some

Titus fostered, sustained, and patronized
by the general government and guarded by
i. the supervisory power of the States which
e guarantee their fiielity, these institutions, I
e have no doubt, would afford as near a aoi*

i. any possibility can be arrived at. Uttder

it be induced to invest their funds in socb

it reflected on them, would circulate sofree~
a ly and extensively as to enable them to sup*
o ply the amount necessary for all the legiti*
, mate uses of the country.
J An increase of banking capital in our
. own S ates is certainly necessary to meet
. the wants of industry, ond to perfect the
- works of improvement already commenced
h lo say nothing of other works equally neces*
n sary to be made. But, unless some ar*
r? rangement can be effected to convert the
e unnatural hostility of the general govern,
