to promote those interests, a unity of fool

which will afford more stable, nod therefore
more real and substantial protection
to our own industry than any laws that;

intermit with the cessation of the stimulants
that produced them.

nual message on the subject of currency j
and exchanges next claim oir attention. I
After pointing out the necessity of amedi- J
iiiti of exchange, approximating to uni-1
formity of value in the different parts of ;
the country, the President proceeds to redeem
the pledge he had given nt the previous
session of Congress, hy submitting
the outlinesof a plan for the safe-keeping
and disbursement of the public revenue >
which shall ut the same time furnish n
currency, . and thus indirectly regulate;*
exchanges, The limits which I have as-'1
1 aigned to this communication forbid a icpetition
of the details of the exchequer J
plan as developed in the message and
afterward more fully exhibited in the bill I
submitted to Congress by the Secretary 1
of the Treasury. .
This is the more regretted, because. I j
nm confident it has not been sufficiently
considered by my fellow.citizens generally,
to he thoroughly understood. It i* 1
emphatically tlte plan of the President,!'
IT originated and matured bv him, with a 1
single modification introduced on the nd- 1'
vice of his Cabinet. It proposes to attain ;J
its objects by the application of powers!1
acknowledged in practice to exist in the!
Government from its foundation. The ! 1
Treasury Department was instituted for '
the collection of tho public revenue, ii5 ((
safe keeping, and its disbursement nc- J '
cording to nets ofnppropriatiun by Con. ' '
gress. Too board of control under t he j4
superintendence of that Department, 1
therefore, was given the inimedintechargo ; I
of this business, with authority to cstab. '
Jish agencies, or employ state banks in its ?
transactions. To these was added the j 1
power of issuing Treasury rotes to the '
amount of fifteen millions, selling drafts,' <
receiving deposits, and purchasing hills ;
l>f a certain description. These were the i
general features ; and tho President invi- I
ted a discussion of its merits, while he ex- t
pressed a readiness lo concur in any i
modification that did not violate itscs-jj
sentinl principles, particularly such as !;
should by any constitutional means re- i
lievc the Chief Magistrate from any con- j
trolling power over the public Treasury. ' r
You perceive how entirely this plan t
constitutional objections, bv < t
M f V.MV<? - O ' j
providing that the functions of purchasing t
and selling drafts, other than for the pur- <
poses of the Government, should he exer- <
vised in any state, only when not prohihi-1 ?
ted by such state. All conflict w itii state <
jurisdiction was prevented, the banking I
priv ileges of the states were left without i
intgpference, the operations of tho Treasury
simplified Rnd facilitated, ;n! theij
great interests of the Union promoted, by ! i
the introduction of a currency founded 1
on the revenues of the country, and yet; j
so limited as to he always equivalent to
^ - specie. This plan has been approved by : I
sonic of the most competent Hnanciris of
thiscouutry and Ungland,and pronounced j i
to be adequate to all our wants, safe in its ;
operations, nr.d calculated to furnish the;]
most perfect currency that could be devised.
So far as the opinion of an indivi- j i
dual who has had some experience in such j
matters, and who, it is known to you, lias
had occasion to become acquainted with
the abuses to which a national bank is JI
from its nature exposed, so far as the I
opinion of such an individual is of anvil
value, it is unhesitatingly given, that this
plan, in its essential features, is far pre. <
ferable to any other that has been submitted,
and that it will accomplish all the
purposes for which it was designed, with- :
out hazard to the Government, without
danger to the people, and without stunu-i
luting anew tlic reckless spirit of specula,
ation whose excesses we have all such j
cause to mourn.
If, as seems to be generally conceded,
the question lies between this plan and a
national bank, tht|?cannot be much room
for doubt or hesitation. Waiving for the ,'
present the insuperable diflicultiespresen- ' I
ted by tho* constitutional objections to i
- such a b^rk operati-ng through the whole
Unioq^objections so long entertained i
by a large portion of our fellow citizens, (
and strengthened rather than diminished
by discussion, and by sad experience of
ff?e tremendous power, and the slid more
tremendous corruptions of such an institution?waiving
these,the very fact of the
existence of such objections and of others 1
of a different character, w ill effectually j
aggpBM IHMWM.3WIWW
history of the last few year9 has, I should
hope, convinced all who are ?pen to conviction,
that any evils which may bo anticipated
from the want of such an institution,
however great, are more tolerable
than the certain, positive and immeasura- i
ble iniuries which we now know have
J
flowed from the existence of one that was
instituted under the most favorable au.
spices, and was committed to the charge
of men at the time esteemed the most lion,
cable and trustworthy in our land.
Within four years of its existence, the
last Bank of the United States became
little better than a den of robbers. Its
managers, with few exceptions, pursued
a systematic scheme of plunder and fraud,
which was arrested by the investigations 1
of a committee of Congress.
Clemency, now believed to have boon
mistaken, toward innocent stockholders,
and a hope that the examplo which had
been made of tho offenders would deter
others from similar practices, saved the
bank from dissolution. It was allowed to
proceed under new restrictions designed
to prevent the recurrence of similar frauds.
In n few years, it was found at open war
with the government of the country, seeking
the renewal of its charier, subsidizing
presses an.1 editors, squandering its trea. i
sures in partisan elections and openly pur- !
chasing the support of tho venial in all :
directions. The moral corruption which |
thus flooded the wholo country was in
itself an evil of the most fearful mngni- (
tude. It struck deep at the roots of pub.
lie faith nnd private honor, and prepared j
the way for that reckless and unbounded
extravagance which the bank itseliVimu- j
lated by the profuse distribution of it*'
money, and the consequences of which I j
we arc now reaping in individual suffer- j j
ings from which a bankrupt law affords I
but slight relief, and in the degradation of j *
[hecharacter of our country by the fraudu- i (
lent insolvcnciesof ourpub!iccorporat:oi,s, | \
and by the shameless refusal of sovereign .
slates to fulfil their obligations.
C |
The final extinction of the same institution
under a state charter, hut managed j J
by the same individuals, and the coaselucnt
inevitable exposition of its affairs, j'
linvc disclosed scenes of depravity and |1
fraud at which the whole country stands I'
igliast. Who can look back at the im- | ^
nense amount of public funds which have
% t
seen entrusted to the fidelity ol the same j
ncn, without a feeling of horror at the j (
ibyss which we have escaped ? And who ! v
would again venture the integrity of any :

lied examples of the feebleness of the ! '
nost unspott< d public and private charae. i
er to icsist the temptations which attend j *

?quul propriety relieve itself of the burden
if governing its territories, by employing
Ihe agency of corporations, and the Post
Office and other departments might like- ,

(
government is inadequate to the entire

we not be bottc. employed in seeking and
providing the necessary powers to enable
it to discharge one of its highest duties,
than in creating artificial bodies to whom ,
O I
this same and still greater powers must he .
confided ? If there ho danger in the e\crciseof
such powers by the selected public

their exercise with the secrecy which j
invariably attends the proceedings of cor- j

by the people, and not responsible to them, : ^

has been urged to the Exchequer plan, j |
then?that it will increase the power of I

Executive Department?is it not un- j
founded an I irmtional? All power is li- I
able to perversion for improper purposes, J
but since it must exist, the true question j
is, where can it be most safely lodged ? j
The American people have answered this j
ouestion by declaring that their own re- |
presentatives,and officers chosen by themselves,
are the most safe depositories of
those powers with which government |
must he clothed, for the protection and j
defence of all. If the constitution would
permjt the selection of the superintending
officers hy other means than the appoint,
ing power which it has created, let those
means he adopted, according to the invitation
of the President. But until they
can be derived or or obtained by the consent
of the states, and the people, wo have
the same and even greater security
against the abuse of such powers, than we
have against the abuse of nnv other
power vested in the Executive.

by tiic people are provided. The system
is capable of any modification or im- ,
provemenl which experience may suggest,
and if, after all, serious evils should
he feit or jus".ly anticipated, no vested i
rights of any corporation can he interposed
to prevent its instant repeal. No hu- 1
man institution is, or can he, free from
liability to abuse, and the fair question 1
ie, whether the advantages to he gained
by furnishing a sound currency to the
country, are so important as to justify
the employment of the powers given by
the Constitution, to obtain them ? The
ability of tiie government itself to accom.
plisli this great object has never yet been
fully and fairly tried.
1 have dwelt on this subject, my friends,
because it has received so little examina.
tion in or out of Congress, and because I
it involves the most momentous interests
to the nation and to its citizens. In the
election of Representatives to Congress,
you are called upon to determine whcth.
or the Exchemier plan shall prevail, or
" i ?
whether a National Bank shall bo established,
or whether the whole matter shall
remain unregulated and unprovided for.
A respectable portion of your fellow citi.
zens avow tiieir desire for the incorporation
of a Bank of tho United States, and
have rallied under the name and banner
of a distinguished statesman, who is
pledged to effect 'hat object by all the
political power which may be placed in
his hands. The appeal to the electors of
the country, to confer such power upon
him and those who concur with him, is
rightfully and fairly made- Against the
creation of any such institution the President
and his administration have contended,
and mean to contend, until the
people in their wisdom shall deprive them
of the power of further resistance. Con- .
Tiding in the intelligent virtue and firmness
of that people, they cheerfully abide
tho issue.
The policy of the Administration of
President Tyler is farther indicated by
the special messages which, during the
ate session of Congf?S8? he deemed it his
Juty to transmit to that uoJy. The first
)f these, of general interest, reiafeo f? the
:ondition of the Treasury, and tho impe."* i
itivc necessity of speedy provision for ful-'
illing our obligations to the public crediors,
nnd defraying the current and una- |
voidable expenses of the government. A I
oan had been authorized for an amount } j
scarcely equal to one half our ordinary {
mnual revenuo, and this sum, relatively i
to insignificant, it had been found im- i 1
i i
iractieablc to obtain. The President
relieved that a pledge of specific funds for j
he payment of the interest nnd tho re- |
lemption of the principal of the loan,!
vould at once, relieve the country from the
>d urn of such a failure, and replenish tho
Treasury until adequate rovenues should
>e provided by the passage of the proper
aws- In the proceeds of the sales of the
>uhlic lands, he perceived such n fund nleady
provided, and he recommended to,1
Jongress the temporary appropriation of!1
t to the great public exigency which pre-'
;ented itself. He was well aware ot ihe ! 1
rlairn which had been interposed in be- (
lalf of the states to a distribution among '
hem of these proceeds. But on examinng
the act of Sept. 1841, providing for
hat distribution, ho found the principles
>n which it should be made, settled by |
hose who had been tho warmost advo:ates
of the claim.
The Whig majority in Congress had by j
hat net determined that such distribution
ihould not take place when the country
-vas engaged in war with a foreign power,
ior when an economical administration of
hp (mvnrnment renuired the imnosition of i
? e? 1 i
iuties exceeding twenty percent, on the j
value of the articles taxed. Congress had j
llius, in accordance with the constant |
iractice which had prevailed fiom the \
foundation of the government, solemnly j
re-asserted its authority to control the distribution
of those proceeds, and to direct
their employment for the benefit of the
nation, whenever its exigencies demanded
them. In his judgment that exigency
had arrived ; and his recommendation was
made accordingly to meet it. The recommendation
was disregarded, and the
loan is not yet taken.
These views of the President were not [
new. In his first message to Congress at
the extra session in June 1841, he said,
14 such a distribution of the proceeds of the
sales of the public lands, provided such
Jistribution does not force upon Congress
the necessity of imposing upon commerce
heavier burdens than those contemplated !
by the act of 1833, would net asancfti-j
:iont remedial measure, by being brought
directly in aid of the states." These sentiments
were expressed to a new Congress
n which there was a known majority in
favor of a distribution, and at a time when
io collision had taken place between the !
('resident and tnat majority, j lie uocrines
unci principles of that message met
ivith universal favor from the Whig press,
ind no exception wus at the time taken
:o the passage above quoted. The act of ,
September 1841, for the distribution of
he proceeds of the land sales, was passed, ,
cud embodied the identical principle thus
stated by the President.
Notwithstanding Congress was thus ,
? ?
distinctly apprised of the views of the Prejident,
which they had sanctioned and
adopted, and of his determination to a J.
hero to them, that body passed two bills
n succession, in direct conflict with the
principles which it hud thus solemnly rer?nrr??ivr?rl_
Th? last of these blil.S bOTC
- "? -- .
conclusive cvidenco on its face that the
contingency contemplated by the compromise
act of September, 1841, had arrived,
that rates of duties exceeding twenty
per cent, had become necessary lor an
economical administration of the govern,
merit, and therefore a suspension of iho
distribution of the land sales, for which
that act had provided, followed as a necessary
and inevitable consequence, and
yet the bill directed that distribution to be
made. Could the approbation of the President
to such a bill have been expected
by uny rational man ? Nothing had occurred
between September, 1841, and
July, 184*2, which could by any possibility
affect tho principles on which distribution
should take place. Congress had been
prc-monishod thntnn empty treasury and a
dishonored credit demanded the application
of all the means of the government
to the supply of the one and the restoration
of the other. Is the conclusion an unfair
one, that the proposition to violate theprinciples
of tho act of September was made
with the design to compel its rejection, in
order to conimuo the agitation whicti nan
been commenced by Mr. Clay, at an early
day of the session, against the veto power,
nnd that it was coupled with provisions for
levying duties on imports, in the expectation
that the interests and feelings of those
who wero to be benefited by those pro.
visions, would thus bo connected with the
ngitation already existing, and that by
these means, the double purpose of gain,
ing fr e ids for the abolition of the veto,
and of aggravating to the utmost extent
hostile feelings against the President,
would be accomplished ? Could the effort
to pass a tariff Inw containing a distribution
clause, under such circumstances,
havo been a sincere one?
To the President's mind theporlentousal.
ternative was presented, of sanctioning a
distribution of public money in violation
of a compact to which he had been a par.
ty, and when every dollar of thut money
was imperiously demanded by the necessities
of the Treasury,?or of incurring
the hazard of leaving the country without
adequate revenue by the refusal of Con
gross to pass a Ml confined to thut subject
alone. Upon this question lie did not
ask the opinions of his Cabinet. Ho considered
the pnth of duty too clear to be
mistaken ; between principle on the ono
side, and expediency on the otlier, he had
no hesitation ; and he determined to return
the bill with his objections. His
firmness triumphed, and the same Congress
passed the same bill, without the
distribution clause, which he instantly and
cheerfully signed. Thus was dissipated
jn ri breath the allegation of his hostility
to a ta.in. It i* passing strange, that
while competuC* a.rQ springing up in all
directions, among tho members of Congress,
for the honor of having savC^ this
bill, no credit, no applause is bestowed C'1
bim, who not only saved it by the intrepidity
of his courso, but who gavo v itality
to it by his signature, and who also saved
the proceeds of the land sales from a diversion
that would have been most injurious
to the credit of the country.

Cheraw, Tuesday, November b,
We give up a great part of this week's paper to
the letter of Mr. Secretary Srr.NCEa in defence of
the course of the President. It is due alike to the
Administration and to the country that such a paper,
in the circumstances, should be circulated as
extensively as possible amonj; the people. There
are a few points in the letter on which it was our
intention to make some remarks, but want of
room prevents th:.3 week.
A letter has been addressed to Mr. Webster
pinned by nearly all the prominent merchants of
New York, olfering him a public dinner, in token
of respect for the manner in which ho conducted
the late negotiation with Lord Ashburton.
Since the above was in type we have received
the correspondence, from which it appears that
Mr. Webster declines the compliment, having
been already detained by indisposition and other
causes, longer from his post at Washington than
he expected when he left it.
Gen. Cass, Minister to France, has written
to his friends that he expects soon to return
home. Movements are already making to procure
his nomination as a Democratic candidate
for the Presidency. He may prove a more formidable
opponent of Mr. Calhoun than Mr. Van
Buren.
The Editor being unavoidably absent from the
ofHcc when the outside of last week's paper went
to press, so many errors occurred in Col. Marshall's
statement of his experiment with corn sown broadcast
that wc insert it this week again. The quantity
of forage from so small a parcel of land is
greater than perhaps any of our readers would cxDeet.

Experiment of John J. Marshall with Buoaccast
Corn?1842.
The land selected was about 5-8ths of an acre
on the river bank just above tho mouth of Whor.
tlcbcrry Creek. It had been planted in corn for
several years and badly cultivated, so that it was
very foul.
It was broken up for the first time on tho 17th
of May, with a two-horse plough, there being a
heavy coat of grass and weeds 011 it, the latter as
high as a tall horse. It was cross ploughed with
a single horse turning plough on the 3Jtb May.
The corn was6o\vcd on rhc 18th of June, at the
rate of very nearly four bushels of our common
seed corn to the acre, and covered with a small
turning plough very shallow?Each ploughing, and
the planting was after a rain.
The corn came up in u few days and grew off
rapidly. When about a month old (the 21st July)
boing from 5 to 6 feet high on the richest part of
the land, it began to lodge just as very rank oats
somettmcs do, and in a few weeks nearly all the
best of the patch was very much fallen and tangled.
It continued green and growing however
pTpnnt fhif immcdiatrlv on the trroiind. which rot
ted.
The fodder having begun to ripen, the corn was
cut on the 19th September, wiih grass blades and
weeding hoes. Two spots wero selected which
were deemed to be u fair average of the whole
patch, each 9 feet equare : On one the stalks
weighed 65/6. and on tho other 100/6. being an
a\crage of 82 1-2/6. to 9 square yard?, and at the
rata of 44,3^7/6. to the arre. A ?pol trfe* ??l?Tt?d
' 3 foat square on which the corn hail not fallen
; down, tho' it did not stand as thick as the land
would have borne it, on which the stalks weighed
I 27lb. being at the rate of l33,6SD/6. to the
acre, estimating an acre to contain 4340 square
' yards.
The day on which tho corn was cut, proving
' cloudy, it was left on the ground till the middle of,
! the next day, when it was put up like a top stack, j
the layer of stalks about 18 inches tliick, and both j
; ends left open. It has cured very nicely. There j
I arc no ears of corn except a few very small and ,
' imperfect.

TUB FIRST APPLICATION OF STEAM TO NAVIOATIOV.
A pamphlet first published in 1788 by Mr. f
James Rurnsey, of Berkeley county, Virginia, doscribing
a boat and engine constructed by hka for ?
the application of steam to navigation, has been
lately reprinted by order of the House of Representatives,
at the instance of Mr. Underwood, of
Kentucky. It purports to be u A Short Treatise H
on the Application of steam, wlicrcby it is clearly
shown from actual experiments, that steam may 1
be applied to propel boats or vessels of any burthen A
against rapid currents with great velocity, ** 41
"BID'NT 1 DRUM WELL 11
Many of your readers, doubtless, have read lb* i
anecdote of the justly celebrateu merchant of Boa* ^
ton, Billy Gray, as he was familiarly called ; but,
lest all your readers may not have seen it, I will
take the liberty to givo the substance here. When 9
Mr. Gray was somewhat advanced in years, he 9
was one day superintending a piece of carpenter 9
work?for nothing about him was permitted to et~
cape his vigilant eye; he had occasion to nepri* H
mand the man who was performing it, for not do* H
ing h:s work well. The carpenter turned upon 1
,*J?u; he and " Billy" being known to each other |
in their y^tli?and said," Billy Gray, what do you I
presume to scolu HO for ? you are a rich man, 'tis jk
true, but did'nt I know you when you were uoth* 9
ing but a drummer V M Well, sir, did'i 11 drum M
well, eh, did'nt I drum well ?" The carpenter
was silenced, and went on to do his work belter,
agreeably to Billy's orders.?Billy Gray commenced
his career a poor boy, and began early and
continued through his long life to act on the prin*
ciple of always drumming well, or otherwise, of
doing every thing as it ought to be done, and not
by halves ; and the result was, that he died worth
his millions of dollars. A number of years since,
I heard from his nephew, who received bis mercantilc
education in his uncle's counting-house,
several anecdotes connected with his habits qf carly
rising, untiring industry, personal supervision of
his immense business, and the clock-work manner
in which'every thing about him had to..move?in- ^
deed, always " drumming weU.n This is a text
from which much, very much, mi^ht be deduced ^
to the advantage of every farmer. Let us, ono j
*nd all. endeavor through the comincr vear to drum I
better than we have ever drummed before; and
an increased reward to our labors will be the sure
result.?Albany Cultivator.
ELECTION JOKE.
It is stated in the New York Tribune that at
the recent election in Luzerne county, (Pa.,) which
is strongly Locofoco, the regular ticket had on it
for the Legislature a Dutchman named KoonaThe
Locos swore they would not go it?they were
against 'coons tooth and nail. So Mr. Koons was t
bac :ed off and a Loco named Broadhcad put in I
his place. This incensed tocne of Koons's friends, g
who instigated Chester Butler, a Whig, to come 2
out as a stump candidate, and helped to elect J
him, though tho Whigs had not deemed it worth 4
while to make any nomination.
