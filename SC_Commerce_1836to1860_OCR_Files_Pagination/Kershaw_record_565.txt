It is plain, that tac President intends to
try to build up u third party for himself.?
He calculates upon desscrtions from the
two great parties, for the sake of office,
and he will, to a certain extent, succeed.
But patronage alone cannot make a party.
He has irrevocably cut himself nflf from
the Whig party by his veto ot the Rank
Bill, and by the Distribution, Bankrupt,
and other Bills, which lie says in his last
veto, he most heartily concurred in, he
has cut himself off from the sound portion
of the Democratic party. The course oi
the Democratic party is plain; Fight oil
the ground they now occupy, without the
least change of position, and their success
is certain. Support the administration
when right, and oppose it when wrong.

London, Aug. 18th, 184!.
The relation of this country with the
United Slates have now become a subject
of most intense interest, if not alarm.?
At a time when a new ministry is about
to assume the reign of power, all eyes
here are fixed upon the party, to endeavor
to ascertain what policy will be pursued
under circumstances of such extreme
doubt and difficulty. In vain however,
the eye gazes over column af;er column
of election harangues, or dinner orations,
emanating from such personages, for the
purpose of solving the problem. Nothing
is to be found falling from the lips of
a Peel, Stanly or Graham, which will
enable any one to trace the drift of the
mind, or the disposition of the individual.
But though the great men among the Conservatives
are discreetly silent upon such
topics, their mere followers, hangers on,
" ' ? - - ?i i
ami particular irienas, uoiu pouucai anu
privuie, display no such delicacy of mint,
or resolution. They boldly avow that a
blow will be struck to retrieve the outraged
honor of Great Britian?that it will
be left for the strong, vigorous Tory Government
to vindicate the rights and liberty
of an increcrated British subject?and
that, if McLeod should fall a victim to
the supineness and indifference of the
Mclb >urne Cabinet, the Foreign Secretary
will at once be dragged to the bar of
the House of Lords and there undergo
charges for impeachment. I am giving
you the opinions and sentiments of men
of wealth, rank anil character, who feci
themselves indignant at what has taken
place, and wish to infnse the same feeling
into the breasts of all who will listen
to their furious outcries and revengpful
aspirations. These persons find any
thing but an apathetic auditory, for go
where you will, sve whom you may, To
ry, Whig, Radical, or Chartist, nil appear
uneasy, annoyed, outraged nnJ envenomed;
and I am perfectly certain that
if the Tories were to follow up the McLeod
question with a declaration of war.
they would soon become excessively popular,
and could then point to their decision
of character, determination of action,
and patriotic preparations, as safe
and secure grounds for demanding a long
continuance of publie support, approbation
an l confidence.
It is the perfect knowledge of this
state of the public mind which has induced
the press of the country to dwell upon
the alleged wrongs of McLeod with force,
vehemenceand repetition. The provincial
papers are constantly alluding to the affair,
and the yeomen are taught to believe,
that it has been entirely owing to the
weakness and imbecility?the grocely
culpable negligence, heartless indifference
of the the present ministry?that u
British officer is now entombed in the
dungeons of a foreign power. The extreme
silence of the government press, is
looked upon as particularly ominous, and
is readily inferred from such conduct, as
a tacit admission, that the policy of Lord
Palmerston is positively indefensible,

man. The other day the Tory Morning
Herald announced, in its first leader the
'important fact" that fifteen sail of the line
had been despatched to the scene of action?New
York?and went on to discant
upon the circumstances with all the glee
and satisfaction of an overjoyed man.?
There is no doubt but the wish was father
to the thought, and that the Tory Duke
of Buckingham, who influences this paper,
would be too happy to see the United
States and this country engaged in a
most sanguinary struggle, so as to keep
the attention of the people away from
the Corn law. What does he care how
many valuable lives fall in the dire and
deadly strife, or how much treasure is
squandered in the slaughter, so long as
his thousands of acres are secured to him,
in fact, the rents kept up to "war prices,"
and the serfs upon his soil still slavishly

master," This state of feeling is not confined
to himself; it is?cherished most dearJy
by the land owners generally, and as
they have such a majority now in Parliamcnt
of themselves, what is there that
they would not do??what war is there
that they would not readily and recklessly
rush into-?if only, by so doing, thej
could stave off any change in the Corr
Laws?direct for a time the public opinion,
and secure to themselves and party
all the privileges and powers of officia

^ The '1'jmes of the Uth takes up the
subject, trtul after alludiug to u passage it
- '. - 'V&.H ? . i***)t
the British and Foreign Review," on
Mr. Wheaton's "Elements of Interna I
linnal L?ws," which says: The commit (
stoning power could not be expected to |
rest satisfied with the judgment of the <
foreign court, on the construction or exe* I
cotton of its own commission," main- i
tains, that if the soundness of this doc- i
; trine he admitted, the principles will go i
; far to cover a stronger case than thai i
which has been "got up by the American i
Lawyers" against McLcod. This com- i
i mcntarv on Air. Wheaton is attributed to
i the late right honorable T. P. Courtenoy,
f who was recently drowned; and the
1 Times goes on to contend for it that even
had the British Government disavowed
i and punished Capt. Drew, and his party, t
for their conduct in the destruction of the
i Caroline, it would not have been compe- i
i tent "to the municipal laws of the United
States (limited to their jurisdiction bv the
laws of nations) to try the Queen of ?ni
stand's officers for those actions." The i
i Times then declares that had the officers
in question exceeded their commission
the American Government might demand
that they should be punished as officers
, who had deviated from the purport of
their commissions and the law of nations
?Allusions is made to the peculiar laws
of the American nation, which transfer
, the case from the action of the goverment
of the United States to that of a
criminal court of the State of New York,
and placing the pardoning power not iu i
the President of rhe United States, but in
the Governor of the State It is impos- j
sible, says the editor, to conceive any i
thing worse than this, and ,4that a demo, i
cratic legislature should have a discre- i
tioiiary power of executing one of the I
Queen's subjects, under pretext of ad- i
ministering justice, in the Slate 01 new
York, and that the only hope of saving i
McLeods's life, if he fails to produce i
witnesses not easily to be procured, is a I
mock appeal to the clemency of an As- t
scmbly, which represents the local pas- i
sions and national violence by which he i
is doomed to perish." The dispatch of i
Mr. Webster is termed conciliatory but e
quite unsatisfactory, and the decision of i
Judge Cowan is characterised as having I
demonstrated that "the law, ns adminis- ?
tered at Utida, is slowly drawing along j
the worst consequences. Doubts may t
reasonably be entertained whether all ne- t
gociaiion on the subject is not peremptorily
broke off, by the decided rejection of
all those principles by which the British
Government declared itself to be guided." The
article thus concludes: "Is it becom- i
ing to the dignity of this countrj that we
should patiently await the very last, per
naps i!i6 laiai, stage 01 muse |um-ti umjo,
against which we have protested from the ,
first? Is it in any way compatible with j
the safety of McLend, and the honor of i
the crown under which he has served, to i
reserve our more forcible remonstrances I
till he is sent by the American judges be- t
yond the reach of succor? If AfcLeod is i
to he acquitted by the force of evidence, t
or any other ground, wc presume that he e
will not be placed in greater jeopardy '
than he now is by any act of the mother i
country. If, as would seem but too pro- i
bable, his chance of a fair trial is as small t
as his chance of subsequent pardon, we
cannot be too soon prepared to interfere r
in the only way which remains to us.
I have been particular in giving you the t
pith of this article, because it has created i
quite an effect, and receves the eulogies of j
men in high authority with both Whigs a
and Tories. The subject I assure you, t
is much discussed privately; and every ?
day with an increase of iro towards the a
Uuited States. The Sunday papers?par- *
ticularly the Tory ones?continue to inflame
the public mind, and the most vile a
and audacious falsehoods are put forth by
tlicm to show, or endeavor to show, that
Lord Palmerston and the Whigs have a
compromised the country and tolerated
a cruel and national outrage on the person
of a British subject. With these felings
abroad, the Cunard steamer of the <i
first of Augmt was sought for with much p
anxiety, but the intelligence brought by H
the Columbia did not afford the excited r
portion of the community much additional a
food for their disease. The Times news- \
paper of the 17th, managed, however, to i
supply this deficiency, by publishing a a
communication, signed "A Barrister," j
and in all the horrors of leaded type and *
conspicious position, of which the follow- (
ing is a copy: t
"I wish to mention a circumstance, i
which should you think fit, might well be t
made known to the public. In France, a r
few days ago, a gentleman much con- p
nected with America, told me that Gen. I
Cass, the Minister of the United States a
in Paris hail-told him that the probable r
result of '.he MrLcod affair would be thut r
he would be convicted by a jury, pardon- i
ed by the government, and then proba- t
bly seized by force and murdered by a c
mob. Now whether this does or does not '
look like a foregone conclusion," or a r
wish father to the thought, "at least it 1
should induce our government to warn t
that of the United States, that it will be
held answerable for the safety of McLeod
until he Li beyond the limits ol the jurisdiction."
'
Of course it will be useless to point
out the absurdity of this very veracious i
statement, and how perfectly ridiculous I
it would be to expect Ueneral (.'ass to I
1 make any sucli statement, eren if he im- !
magined such a contingency by any pns- i
| sihility as likely to occur. But it is not

' public mind, for a ministerial paper pub*
