and Savannah, and the advantages (t1:s

there being acarcel. any paper afloat but
that of the Banks of Georgia. This evil
and ihis inconvenience have been in a
great degree obviated since the foundation
of Hamburg, and thie circulation of the
paper of our Banks is thus increased to
th, exclu-ion of rhat of straugers.
From the constant intercourse preserved.
formerly, between the State of Georgia
and the upper districis of this State. the
laster were almost strangers to their fellow
citizens in the lower dltsicts, and a sort,
of alien spirit. was produced amotig them
that wedded them more..sirongly in tie
viees abd intere:s ofst neigliboring St ate
this5 to those of their t..vn. This un
wholesome stite of feeling has bcen alter
ed, and the bonds of idizenship have been
strengtheited and the symapathies.of cor
munities have been directed into their pro
per and naturalchanncl: a coustant,rapid
and safe communication having been es
tablished between the extremes of the l
State, an union ofsentimenm and a singlc
nesso ofobject obtain throughout all its dfis
tricts....This is5mothbr benefit derived
from the biz'lding of'flamburg.
...The. present Steam Boat navigat ion. of
the. Sassnuah river, uniting the distant
places of Charlestou and Iunburg, is al
together a consequence of the fundation
of the town of Hamburg. The benefits
of ibis navigation are notorious and swell
iobaportsof this city riih -Ahe products I
pf our upper districts-with those of many
counties of North Carolina and likewise cf
Geargia. In return this market becomes
the centro to which most of the eupplieb
for the western country are directed ; thus
making Cha.-lesto. the emporium orthree
contagnous states, and contributing largely
to the peculiar interest of South Carolina.
- Nor eis this conmunication tharough
lanmburg any forced state of things; it is
nothe1 rap anad fashipa of ihe day to- be
laid asfde wben new aoes may appoar. It
is in fact #he natural chaoeel through
wbiehn aetbrough whieb alone,the trade
of the Western Country can reach this city.
The amount of the products that have
passed to and fro between Charleston and I
Hamhurg, has increased is value and in
quantity, nist by progressive steps, but by
sudden and rapid ucrenents. There were
warehoused in Hamburg, the first season
of it, business, 17.S% bales Idt Cotton
and in the second season 27.857 hales. In
the second season there were wrarehouscd
in the mouth of October 1,22S biles, tiand
in the same month of this vcar3.149 s les;
an increase in this swamou for that miouth
alone of 1,21 bales.
. During the first season, emplovment
was given by the trade beiween this cit
and Hamburg in ongle ste.iboat. It the
second season two nere necessary, andl
this season there is a thirl added; and at
no season have the- boats bceen Sufficient

the successful issue of his object. he must
have credit for that prudence which shold
guide every tman'in the application of his
1moans,.be they what ahoy may. Oneo
thing, however, is certain; Msr Shlti
could not .,atance .his priva te interest
without prdonoting the publie good--they
w'ere insepaablran~d. wore identified the
one with teotheir. What is called pub

-a happy conjunction of the interests andi
objhects of an indivtdnal with those of the
community and an expanded -and liberal
mode of applying industrywealth or talent
to such cnterprizes as shall redound at
onre to the honor or profit or renown of a
pri'ate person and society in general.
Tre benefits that have accrued and may
hereafter accrue to this state. from the
exertions of Mr. Shultz, are immense
they are such as she has derived from the
labors and enterprize of no other individu
al in it. From the past we may judge of
the future, and from the completion of
what Mr. S. engaged to perforsa in the
year 1821, combined with l.is superadded
experience, sinee, we may trust him both
in theory and practice as one competent
to inform anJ due to be trusted on his
statements.
It was suggested, when Mr. Shakz
made his application for assistance to our
Legislature m 1821. that some of his as
sertions were very bold, and indeed they
failed in receiving the credence of many.

The State of Georgia is aware of the
present nud growing importance of Ham
burg to South Carolina and to Charleston
in particular. She is -consious. that for
eigo trade is engrossed by us in -a great
degree from tire command of this intesnal
position. . Hence it is, that meeiings have
been held in Savanonb nad Augusta to
draft petitions to 4he Legislature 'of Geor
gin praying for aid to restore to the-cities
of the State that commercial prosperity
whicbfis fa=i leaving them, and which they
fear would be delivered peranendty to
another channel-praying also for ahera
6ions of the-laws that. concro the naviga
tion of her rivers. and the charter of one
of her Steam-boat companies. The bridge
of Augusta -has been also temporarily
thrown open, by means of a private sub
wription, for wagons coming-into or leav
ing that city for some of the purposes of
trade. This bridge is the property of the
Rank of the State of Georgia, and we
tihierve ihat a hill has been lately intro
duccl into the Legislature of that State
for appropriating a futnd for purchasing it
and throwing i entirely open to the public.
In tu.h: the enter prisc of one single man

A LETTER FROM MRdWALHOUN.
TO Tas mmafois ' -
FoaT Hr.r., Juy 28; 1843.
Messar Palo & Seaton--I.have jots
received from a friend the Nationi ing
ligencer of the 12th and -15thstg. coo
tainng your remarks on avelabage..ie.
ly published bytbeHarporsf New Yo*.,
entitled -'Speechbs of Mr. Calbow.'de-'
livered in 1he Congressofthegaited State
from 1811 to the presnt time." Tour
remarks are headed, "Political History-.
Suppressed speeches-of Mfr- Clbodmn."
"Suppressed" is a strong word. The
highest authorities degne--it to be, pot
down, destroyed conceale4 and'ar re
marks leave no-doubttit you itehded 3o
use it in the srongo and molt
sense-thatis, thatey have, been Inteo
tionally omitted in 'iercompiladosia or
der to give a partial and fals vim ewn
Opinions; and, for that, p ~rposr
title was given to the volmgfTo the
truth of this you pledge -idhit our
word by heading )our remarkas' esif
History." The charge is agraveoee,and
wade in an imposing mannerand ifrue,
the. imposition would doserve'Atbe'puba
reprobation. -Thequestion, then, is, is at
true? Let facts answer -
The title is, indeed,'Ialse-Iblse every
way.-. It:covers mueh not Included in t,.
volume, and omits muchthatisi.-repots,
leters, and -oiher writings.. -Yen 11ov
noticed the former, and called -piliia
tenion to it, but apt the. laster, 4h1.# e
qually obvious and very ma6W au-de
termining whether the falsifjof the tide
is a mere error is a-frauduleet attempt at
impoitio. The one might, -with some
plnsibity, becoaldirued to be kn attempt
at imposition ; but it-is impossiblefor any
ingenuy so to construe the ethier.i r
impossible to assigq to it a frandulent' ob
ject. ,Eutriftho one isan-errori whynot
the bther 1 Ia fact ibe'very groesmessof
both can -leave no doubt that they are
merely errors. ]i is not possible to open
the volume without detecting them. T -
title colers all th speeches of -Mr.' Cal
boon fmm 1811, wha hp-etee Con
gress, till the present'. da -Nwhll the
volume contains but one.' aoech ito
1833. -Again: it omits to mention 'any
thin; but sleethes, -*hen of the lowr rsAt
of his productions of which the comasla.
tiop s 'composed only one is ra.ispown.
To make its dem more palpa all
those are headed "eSpeeches.": -afRand
erer - been known to do. its; work In wn
clumsy a' manner?.- IV4uii let s af'se
words on a thing so plain. Thi rloe
title is a gross blunder, of which I have
much greater reason to complain ihan aoy
one else. It looks much 'more like an at
tempt to injure me than to impose en the
public, 1, however, ca::.suspect'tiothing
of the kind. Ifow it happened I knowt
not; nor is it material, so far a it relates
to the object of this communicadd'; but
I deem it duo to myglf to state all I know
about it..-. -. -
It so happens I have never yet seen'the
volume. I saw the title and the adver
tisemeut not long since Tor the frst time.
I wan, as may be imagined; indignant at
the blunder. I wrote -immediately to a
riend, who took ad interest In tie pibli
ration and corresponded with thoJublish
e, and: pointed out the blunderS 'in the
title and the objections to'the -adverlise
ment, nod suggested the'corrections.tba;
should be made, which 1 regoested him tot
have done forthwith. It was too late. I
received his answer a few days since. He
informed me that he lied perceived the
bluders bfore he got my letter, and had
prepared a correction, hut owing to :sonte
delay in the transmission, it was,mot re
ceived in ti'me it may be propeq to add,
that the ritle I suggested (as well as l can
recollect) was, " A selection from the
speeches, reports, and other- wridapg of
3Mr. Calhoun, soubsequent-to his'eleenonUa
Vice President of t be United States, in
cluding his leadig speech os the, late war,"
