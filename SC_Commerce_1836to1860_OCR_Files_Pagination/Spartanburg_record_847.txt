WEDDED LOVE.
% BY ROBERT WALSH.
We have somewhere seen tho doctrine that
love in a state of courtship is the true beatitude of
( this life; and to be desired beyond any other food
relation even for a thousand years ! 1 he writer of
those opinions could t.ot have been married, or ut
loast, not experienced a wedlock even commonly
fortunate, otherwise his own happiness would
have taught him a different and juster theory.
In the conjugal union, love may lose some of its
>t may he less vehement or rapturous;
end the imagination, which, during courtship, commonly
feeds, as it were, on nectar and ambrosia,
u id sports on a bed of roses,?may become comp
iratively inert and sterile; but tho pleasures of
h?j, ul'iwu nuiimiiciiL, ?nu uounuicBs, mutual
nfidonce, and the excitement of virtuous. and
tender hope, are infinitely multiplied.
Lord Verulam has truly said that marriage
h. Ives griefs and doubles joy. It combines, in
f\ct, and transfuses existence for each party; it
Llends and identifies souls, so as to render cotn>.
in to them their several susceptibilities of graduation
and refinement; it creates new energies,
.v d generous sympathies; now objects of endearment
nnd reliance; numberless reflected and reciprocated
fuvors of regard and respect.
llut what gives it a superior character of inherent
dignity und genuine enjoyment is the religious
esconou peculiar to, it; the vein of duty which perv:.tes
it; the consciousness of those who are suddenly
allied in it, that they have ndopted a tie hall.1
tired by divine sanction, and aro fulfilling one of
k. .. .. .*e vr
The eostaoiesof courtship are dashed by fears,
iealousics, misapprehensions, which are unknown
to wedded partners of sound tninds and affectionate
hearts, with them, all is trust and security; their
faith is beyond the sphere of temptation or accident;
their adversity, if misfortunes come, has
onsolations derived from the most exalted sourc?
i; from the invisible and holy world, as well as
the present checkered scenes of human action.
The qualified worship of an excellent fellowije.ng,
natural and delightful as it is, involves something
more rational and elevated, when the object
ii a wife or husband, than when it refers to a
more mistress or lover. In the first case, it assoc
ates itself with duty, and implies an esteem the
more proper and grateful as accompanied by intiMRli'
Lii'iurliulun
? ? 0?
In |>m|K>rtiou, however, as marriage is of a sailed
and permanent nature, producing weighty
obligations and liable to special and severe cures
calamities, ought it to be cautiously, and delibe
fttely, ond piously contracted. It is not to be
>wed or anti?i|?atud u a.merely halcyon career,
h as it often is in smiling prospects and auspicis
events, ond screnoas it may be rendered in all
it the human creature can control. A childish
i kc/tanf, a calculation of convenience, a momenta
caprice, form no warrant for it; though they be
freijuontly the only incentives.
Such a bond rcquiros matured and discriminating
*' achment: comprehension of its good and evil;
resignation to all the chances. But he or she who
)i.j$ the right, intelligence, feeling and opportunity)
ami yet avoids it, yielding to selfishness or cow*r<iice,
sins against the designs of Providence, and
ices the final rewards of courageous and successful
trial.
It was a favorite remark of tmrd Littleton, the
% younger, that marriago is a Tottery, and that, of
ourse, it is as preposterous to rejoice at a wedding,
sa it would be to exult in purchasing a ticket for
the State-wheel.
According to the same questionable anthority,

connubial scheme should ascertain that ho has
d'-awn a prize, before he indulges himself in solfvp
ttulation, or welcomes the greeting of his friends.
The analogy is not, however, exact?because it is
iu the power of the bridal parties to .determine
>?eir own fate, in a matyri|l decree. Life itself
might lie equally styled a lottery, looking to the
di versity of its chunces and the incertitude of its
incidents; but it is, nevertheless, a positive blessbig
with well constituted minds and healthful
frames. So, likewise, is marriage, which should
be undertaken as life is accepted,?-with stronger
expectation of weal than wo:?with bright visions
and cheerful resolutions; but, also with a spirit
pf philosophical or christian submission to whatever
Pipvidence may ordain to its course. The Greeks
nfcde Hymen descend from Apollo, Urania, or
T^liope. This origin from the fountain of harmony
and light, and the twwRoblest of the muses, illustrates
or shadows from the true character of
thp espousals over which the garlanded god waves
his ncr?, dying t?rdi, and" sheds His cetostml in
flue nee.
A Good Reason.?A few day sinco a grand
jury out South ignored a bill against a huge negro
for stealing chickens, and before discharging him
from custody, the judge hade him stand a reproniand.
Ho concluded as follows*
"You may go now, John, (shaking his finger at
at him.) let mo warn you never to appear here
again."
John, with dolight beaming from his big white
eyes, and with a broad grin, displaying a row of
beautiful ivory, replied:
"I woudn't bin dlsunoc, Judge, only de consta
blc fotcH me."
etas of tub Mind rksfbcting thi pUTUB_
The common bias of the mind ?n^*^ihtodlv is
(such is the benevolent appointment .r p?,vidence)
to think favorably or the future OVer- sr
value the chances of possible good, and to Vjj aj
rate the risks of possible evil; and in the caj^
some fortunate individuals, this disposition rcm*,n|
after many disappointments. To what this bi s
of our nature is owing, it is not material for us ^
enquire ; the fact is certain, and it is an importan ^
one to our happiness. It supports us under th*
real distress of life?cheers and animates all oi?
labors; and, although it is sometimes apt to pro fa<
dnce in a weak and iudolent mind, thdie deceitfu
suggestions of ambition and vanity which lead ui
to ssMfiiice the du'.ies and comforts of tbo pre | ^

bit? of activity, and regulated by a solid judg- 4
mcnt, to have a favorable effect on tho character, o
prompt to grclViTnte^Ti^il'sufd^r^Tiecessary to
ensure their success. When such a temper is d
united with pleasing notions concerning the order u
of the universe, concerning the condition and a
prospects of tnan, is- places our happiness in a tl
great measure, beyond the power of fortune.? o
While it adds double relish to every enjoyment, ?y
it blunts the edge of all our sufferings; and even a
when human life presents to us no object on which ii
our hopes cun rest, it invites the imagination be- fi
yond the dark and troubled horizon which termi- G
nates all our earthly prospects, to wander uncon- tl
fined in the regions of futurity. A man of bene- v
volence, whose mind is enlarged by philosophy, h
will indulge the same agreeable anticipations with c
respect to society ; will view "the different im- ii
provements in arts, in commerce and in the sci- 'J
enoes. as to co-operate in promoting the union, the n
happiness, and virtuo of mankind; and amidst the tl
political disorders resulting from the prejudices
and follies of his own times, will look forward tl
with transport to the blessings, which arc reserved h

result of mental suffering, like the fever produced
by n wound. I sometimes doubt tears; I often
doubt the existence of that misery which flushes e
the cheek und kindles the eye, and which makes
the lip mock with sparkling words, the dark and *
hidden world within. jj
There is something in intense suffering, that tj
seeks concealment?something that is fain to belie
itself. In C?K?per's novel of the "Bravo," Jacijues
conceals himself and his boat, by lying v
where the moonlight dazzled on the wafer. We
do the same with any great despair; we shroud
in a glittering atmosphere of smiles and jests ; but
the smiles are sneers, and the jests are sarcasms. ?
There is always a vein of bitterness runs through ?

a u?ntlb?an.? i lie character of a gentleman
may he explained nearly thus: a
A blackguard is one who docs not care who
he offends; a clown is n blockhead who does not
know when he offends; a gentleman is one who
understands and shows every murk of deference
to the claims of self love in others, and exacts it in
return from them. A man may have the manners
of a gentleman without having the look, and he
may huvo the charucter of a gentleman, in a more
abstracted point of view, without the manners.?
The feelings of a gentleman in this higher sense,
only denote a more refined humanity?a spirit delicnto
in itself, and unwilling to offend, either in
the greatest or the smallest things. This maybe
coupled with ahsense of mind, with ignorance of
forms, nnd frequent blunders^ hut the will is good;
the spring of gentle offices and truo regard is untainted.
A person of this stamp blushes at an impropriety

"Blessings on the man who invented sleep" said
the immortal Saticho Panzu, "for it covers one

subject?
One hour's sleep before midnight, is worth
two after.
The morning to the mountain, tho evening to
the fountain.
Go to bed with the lamb and rise with the

Who sups well, sleeps well.

Hooks of devotion and those of love are alike

there are more who buy hooks of devotion than
read them.

will forgive a liberty but not a slight. You may

To weep for fear is childish; to weep for anger
is womanish; to weep for grief is human; to weep
for compassion is divine; but to weep for sin is .
Christian.

ipon the face of the act itself, which provides a
emporary protection of 25 per cent, on cotton and
vollen manufactures, for three years, to be then
educed to 20 per cent.
The honorable senator, [Mr. ^hoate,] in cxlounding
the taritf of 1789, hus given Uc> the comneutary
without the text. Nqw. sir, I have givin
you the text of the act of laltf, and shall pro:eed
to give you the commentary. To show you
jjnr.if wija rc^nxrr^
etnarks of the mosrerninent stnstfan who were
nigaged in its discussion. Wj1 i
Mr. Webster proposed that the fluty on cotton
ind woollen manufactures should commence at 30
>er cent, and come down tq 20 at the expiration
>f four years, by two successive gradations. Mr.
Jlny proposed that the duty should begin at 30
>er cent., and thut it should bo reduced to 20 in
lix years, by three gradutions. Upon this the folowing
conversation took place :
Mr. Ltotvndcs remarked that "ho rejoiced to sec
gentlemen who had manifested the strongest friendship
for the manufacturing interest, the udvocates

i return to correct principles."

lie said : "He hoped tiie Amendment would

I have now given an exposition of the system ol

icnator from Massachusetts has solemnly declared
vas fatal to the commerce of the country, and comlelled
Massachusetts to abandon navigation and
sommerce, and embark against her will in the busness
of producing manufactures ! ! If the honorible

ict of 1789, which the senator himself [Mr. Cho
ite] said was then amply sufficient In what, then

A horizontal tariff! an absolute Water level! in
?qual violation of the laws of hydrostatics and ol
ho protective system ! Such a system, in the opinon
of the honorable senator, would instantly cause
he water wheel of every factory to stand as stock
itill as the current of a standing pool,
Such, Mr. President, is the profound and pliiosophical
reasoning of the sena^*^. from Massaihusetts,
from the historical progress of the proactive
system, up to the year lff-ii.
The next great era in the prqAwA Pro"
octivo system was produced hytha tariff of 1824,
>y which the duty on woollen tttuitifactures was
aised from 2U to 33 1-2 per c**.;' * ? * on cotton
nannfactures from 5 to 7 1-2 Ante a square yard,
ind the duties upon Swedish iron and Russian
temp in a still greater proportion.
In the year 1820, when the increased duties aferwards
imposed by the act of ]?24 were in agiation,
Mr. Webster, at a public meeting in the
own of Boston, over which Judf^o Story presided,
leclercd that the protective duties then in contemplation
were, in his opinion, of doubtful eonstitu
tionality ; and that meeting passed a string of resolutions,
which were lately read at the instance ol
tho honorable senator from Alabama, [Mr. Bagby,]
which furnished a clear and?conclusive answer to
every argument now advanced in favor of the
protective system/'^What then wore the principles
of Massachusetts in 1821 1 She stood shoulder
to shoulder with South-Carolina in opposition
to the tariff of that year ; and it is worthy of special
remark that, with tho exception of two or three
votes from Western Virginia, there was not a single
vote given in either branch of Congress from any
State south or southwest of the Potomac, in favor
nftknt in* -
? ...?v ...WU9UIV. iK a great ^uimuai
alliance took place between the East and West,
one of the fruits of which was soon seen in the
new attitude suddenly assumed by Massachusetts
in regard to the protective system. Mr. Webster
from being the leading opponent of that system
all at once became its prominent supporter. Anc
4glX7 rcuun umnlj alio "Jbrtlmji alcVr g'TC" VJ inn
dtsringuisheu statesman for sacrificing his constitu
tional scruples, his principles of political economy
of political justice, and of equal taxation, was thu
it had beoOtne the interest of Massachusetts to sup
port a system which, (to use hi3 own language u
1820,) was calculated to "favor great capitalists
rather than personal industry or the owners o
small capitals:" to make "the fanner give mon
than he now does for all he buys, and receive les
for all he sells and finally, "to diminish the in
dustry, impede the prosperity, and corrupt the
morals of the people." Such, sir, were the con
elusive arguments urged in advance against tin
tariff of 1824, and such the groat principles o
justice and equality which Massachusetts sac
rificed at tho shrine of her own pecuniary interesl
Accordingly Mr. Webster voted for the tariff <j
1828, and has ever since been a prominent sup
porter of the interest of "large capitalists." makin,
"the farmer give more for all lie buys and receiv
less for all he sells;" and at thesamu time "dimir
ishing the industry, impeding the prosperity, an
f*Orniptin^ l)io uf tlir jMlViplc*
But the honorable senator from Massachusett
[Mr. Bates] has selected certain votes given by tli
representatives of the South, including myself, ii
creasing the duties upon certain articles in the tari
of 1828.
Now, I will inform that senator that thoso vote
were given to defeat that "bill of abominations,
urged upon the country to promoto the special it
te rests of Massachusetts. We saw that this systei
of protection was about to assume more gigant
dimensions, and to devour the substance of tl:
country, and we determined to put such iugrcd
ents in the chalice as would poison the monster, ar
commend it to his own lips. This is what is som
times called "fighting the devil with fire," a polic
which, though I did not altogether approve,
adopted in deference to the opinions of those wi
whom I acted. In 1832, the public debt havii
been extinguished, the tariff of that year was pas
ed, retaining all the more oppressive features
the act of 1828, and relieving the manufaclurii
f*raiT llnrrf -fl tli9 burden^, pf taxation,s
iMnrf tmrin w^'ninnuuro u) wqatn-tjuioiina, st
out of this grew the compromise of 1833, whit
was regarded as a final adjustment of the cjuestit
of protection, providing for a gradual reduction
the duties'till they reached the revenue point
20 per cent. But in 1812 the manufactures aga
besieged the Capitol ; and in violation of the fai
solemnly plighted by the act of 1S33, induct
i Congress to pass the present tariff, incomparab
, more unjust and oppressive, as 1 shall hereafti
show, than the tariff of 1S32.
Having thus closed the historical review of tl
protective system, I shall now proceed to auswi
, some of the prominent arguments in favor of tl
, tariff of 1842.
And I shall first examine an argument of tl
senator from Maine, which he ventures to dra
from the historical facts I have disclosed. He sa
1 that, from 1789 to the present time, every increa
of protective duties has invariably produced i
increase of revenue, an increase of foreign coi
werce, and a diminution of the price of inanufa
tures. forcitru aud domestic. Now, sir I am ha

1 raised some 50 per cent, higher. This additior

t clared, double the rate of protective duties was r
" quired in 1828 to enablo tho domestic inanufs
turers to meet their foreign competitors in our ov
i markets that was required in 1816, it follows th
r the fall in the price of domestic manufactures
the interval was 25 per cent, less than it was
foreign countries. Owing to the reduction of tl

and the greet improvements'in macliinery, tliei
has been a progressive and unexampled reductic
in the price of manufactures nil over the wor
since 1816; and although the reduction has be<
less in the United States, by 25 per cent., than
Great Britain, it is a prevailing fallacy that tl
reduction has been produced by high duties <
i foreign manufactures. If, after twenty-eight yen
of protection, our manufacturers cannot meet the
foreign competitors with the protection afford*
by a system or revenue duties, when shall we rea
ize the promised blessing of obtaining domost
manufactures cheaper than we can import the
from abroad I For twenty-eight yeau*a, we ha*
been steadily receding from the millenium instea
of advancing to it, as the successive additions to oi
protective duties practically and historically prov
fco that the great historical fact of tho honorab'
senator
from Maine turns out to bo something les}
than no act at all. v
I now propose to expose the stereotyped.!
fallacy that high duties s make low prices?Uv
1 the test of a philosophical analysis. The hoo-^
orable Senator front Maine has repeatedly said/:
in the course of his debate, that the price of roan}
u fact urea, as overy thing else, depends upon sup^
ply and demand. This is very true, as to thoa^fc
temporary fluctuations in price which result front
the accidental increase of the supply beyond thn
demand, or of the demand beyond the supply.?
But that Senator well knows that the permanent
1 price of every commodity deponds exclusively
> upon the cost of production. No man will con*
tinue to produce a commodity which will not
t indemnify him for the expenditures incurred iaf
, producing it. Now there are three great elements
? that constitute the price of every manufacture.?
1 The wages of labor, the profits of capital, and the
1 cost ot trio raw uiuienai. prupo?*? wr uu? -
quire what is the effect of the protective system
> on each of these three elements. And, first, is it >
t not the avowed design and obvious effect of this
- system to enhance the wages of the labor engagi
ed in producing manufactures! The great and
. boasted merit of the system is its tendency to prof
teet labor by increasing the wages of the laborer,
a ?not for a day or a year but permanently. Tako
s away this merit, and you dissolve the charm by
- which the people have been deluded, even in the
J manufacturing States, and the whole fabric will
- tumblo into ruins. I readily admit, what the man
e utacturere so incessantly proclaim, that the protocf
tive system docs permanently increase the wages
of manufacturing labor. Let us now enquiro
t. what is the effect of the protective system upon
f the profits of the capital invested in the rnanufac
turing business. That the design and the effect of
g this system is, to enhance the profits of capital, is
c avowed by the manufacturers, and is, indeed
i- self-evident proposition. They solemnly dofelsro
d to you that they cannot make any profit at all,
but will be brought to utter ruin, even if we
ts should reduce the duties to a fair revenue st&nic
dard. And when wo look to actual results, wo
i- find that the protected manufacturers are now roll
ulizing enormous and unexampled profits. What,
then, is the effect of the protective system on tho
price of the raw material! As to wool, iron, and
" hemp, they are all protected by the highest rato
a- of duties, and the pneo is obviously enhaticcd, as
m well by these duties as by tho increase of tho
ic wages of labor, and tho profits of qapital en>e
gaged in producing them. And even as to tho
It- raw cotton, tho honorable senator from Rhode laid
land [Mr. Simmons] gave us the comforting ase
surance that the price had been raised sinco 18421
y Now, sir, I have demonstrated, and tho manufacI
tures and their advocates here affirm, that the effect
th and design of the protective system is to increoso
'g tlio wages ot labor, the pronts ot capital, ana n?
is- price of the raw material?every one of the eleot
ments constituting the coat of production; and yet,
ig by aotne incomprehensible and supernatural proa
sTpSs
:h man delusion and superstition, I do not believe
>h there can be found a more stupendous impostuto
of than that which I have jtist exposed,
of Mr. President, it was profoundly remarked by
?n a great mathematician, whose name I have forgolth
ten, though I think he lived in the age of Archie
:d rnedes, that two and two make four; and thouglt
ly this proposition has been ably controverted by
nr Dean Swift and other writers, I incline, after
reviewing the whole arguments, to. agree with
ie Sliakspeare, that "to prove that two and two
er make four is a very pretty argument." It wa?
also the remark of another great philosopher, that
all the parts are equaL.to the whole; and converso?e
ly that the whole is equal to all its parts. But
w you will at once perceive that these great philosys
ophers knew nothing of the profound mysteries of
so the protective system. For it is an established
m unci fundamental doctrine, upon which this great
n- system reposes, that you may double all the parts
c- and yet diminish the whole. What incalculable
p- blessings would tbo honorable senators over the
on way cuna-i upuu iite uur--lug ujjerailves ol"
ro land, if they would reveal to thom this great dia16
covery !
ttd But when senators aro driven from all their oth's,
er defences, they contend that this reduction of
sd prices, under a system which increases the cost
le of production, is produoed by the extraordinary
o- stimulus given to domestic competition, by ex
iic ciuamg tne toreign competitor, who can pay a
re revenue duty at the custom house, and still undor?al
sell the domestic manufacturer. This is certainly
ce a strange mode of increasing competition, with a
>m view to reduce prices. If the object of the corned
petition were to see who could sell the highest.
In the means would be not badly adapted to the end.
ill But Mr. President, I am literally worn down
iat in contending with these intellectual phantoms by
m- gravo argument. They constantly elude tho
it. grasp of reason, and "vanish into thin air." For
le- the sake, therefore, of obtaining for myself, and
he affording to the Senate, some relaxation from these
ad abstruse disquisitions, I propose to furnish a praciieni
m. . ..i- :J? .1
ut- tion which every body can understand. To pron
ceed, then: I havo a personal friend, who has
nd been engaged in raising and training horses for the
tr iuri, lor about 2U years?nearly as long as this
jn system of protection lias been in ojieration. Ho
it- inherited a very superior stock of native Americo
ran horses, and 1ms all his life labored under tho
mi deluson, of which neither time nor adversity can
ce cure hirn?that the native stock of raco horses, if
lie properly managed, is superior to the best strain of
o- imported horses. It has so happened, that in a
e- racing career of 20 years, he has never won a
ic- single race, even by accident. Yet h'6 is as
vn sanguno as ever. On one occasion, I met his
at trainer, who was a black servant, leaving tbe raco
in course with the horses, all of them having been
in disgracefully beaten. I said to him, "how does it
he happen, Ponipey, that with such a superior stock
d, of horses you never win a race ?" "Ah dat's
re very true," said the trainer with an air of triumph*
in "our horses can't run wid dese '|>ortcd horses you
Id call 'Dolphin, 'Rahinnf hu? 1 tell ynn what n?y
Jn can do : doy can beat ono another all to pieces.?
in And it would do your heart good to see dat bay
ie filly, Anti-tariff, beat dat clumsy black horse \ro
in f-?ll nrnloofinn "
vs Now, Mr. President, it lias occnrod tome that I
'ir can put my unlucky friend upon a plan by which
>d he will be as successful hereafter as ho has been
il- hithorto unfortunate. I propose, then, if my honic
orable friends on the other side of the house think
m it a feasible scheme, to recommend to my friend,
re when I rotnrn home, to apply to the jockey clnh
id of South-Carolina for a protective tariff, by whioh
?r it shall be enacted that every horse of foreign blood,
e. or in whose veins foreign blood is the material of
I* chief value, shall carry 40 pet cent, more weighs
