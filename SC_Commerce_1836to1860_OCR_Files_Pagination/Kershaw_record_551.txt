AGRICULTURAL. 8
w
From the Temperance Advocate. g
To the Newberry Agricultural Society? g
In discharge of the duty assigned to me, j fi
with other members, at the last meeting of! V
the Agricultural Society, 1 will, as wen as;g
I am able, put you in possession of all the { a
information which I possess, on the sub-iu
ject of wheat. I have now, for 21 years, |d
-annually sowed a crop of wheat: and I,A
have uniformly made some, although in si
two years, that some was very little, and k
very indifferent. Yet, on the whole, l b
have generally made enough for the use of u
my family, and j-am persuaded that there 'it
are few farmers, who cannot do as well, II
and ftiany who can do abundantly better, jsl
The attention should be first directed to 2

thai "a change from sand is no change at;b
all," by which is meant, when you change b
your seed wheat, do not take from a sandy
soil. A strong clay soil gives the best varieties
of wheat. For our climate, wheat
: from the North or West does not answer
well; it is generally too late, and is more w
liable to the rust. If we could obtain t;
wheal from parallels of latitude in the old ii
world, corresponding with ottr's, I think k
it would succeed admirably. So too, s
wheat, from the South and South West of '1
our own continent, will do well, and hence a
1 have no doubt, that the variety of Tex- e
ian Wheat; introduced among us by our c
estimable citizen, and enlerprizing and c
skilful farmer, Judge Wilson, will sue- h
?.1 Of our own varieties.' n
tcui UUIIKI MW. J -
none have answered so well with me, as e
that which is known by the name of the c
Holland Wheat. It is a small yellow 1
grain, and weighs uniformly CO lbs. and i
? - upwards to the bushel. It ripens about a s
week, earlier than our common winter 1
wheat, and will stand longer after it is ripe. ^
As it ripens, the field exhibits a most j
beautiful yellow golden appearance, look-,s
, ^ing at it, as generally moved by the wind, it r
'looks like a sea of molten gold. It is not, ^
as liable to rust, blight or smut. I obtain-[v
ed it from John Holland, of Laurens, in 0
- the year 1833, when the wheat of the up- *
per country, was entirely blighted and de-!c
stioyed. He made from 2C acres, 200
bushels of nicely cleaned, merchantable ,1
wheat. _ I have sowed it every year since. 1
- This year, and 1839, it was slightly ^
touched by the rust, but not so as to injure n
in 1839, I found a little smut in it, but ^
not enough to compel us to wash it. | s
The seed ought not only to be selected 8
.from a good variety, but it should be well 0
prepared for being sown. In the first s
- ' ? ll? u.. ?
place, It SflOUJa DP UIUIuu?ui;r uncu uy
'the sun before it is put up for seed: this f
prevents weavels, and gives sound and s
^healthy grains for vegetation. In the next ?
-place, sift the seed carefully with a good i
sand seive: this will take out all the small i1
immature grains. In the third place, for f
24 hours before you sow it, soak your seed a
in a preparation of water saturated with k
about 1 lb, of bluestone to every 5 bushels f
of wheat. Before you lake out your seed j1
wheat, which will be found at the bottom *
,of the cask or tub, in which you soak it, 1
skim off the floating grains and trash.?
When 1 bare pursued this course, which 0
was recommended to me by my friend,
John S. Carwile, I have escaped the srnut. 1
At least a bushel of seed should be sown 1
io the acre: When the ground is good, *
from one and a quarter to one and u half
bushels may be sown. Wheat thus sown
will make a greater yield, and is not so lia. c
tie to rust. This idea, I remember, was c
suggested many years ago, by Mr. North, 1
? . / n ll_i p
to ine f armer s oocieiy 01 renuieiun, mm was
enforced by such reasons, as induced v
xne lo yield my assent to it fully. I wish,
that by some means, the Agricultural 1
community could again have the opportu*
njty of reading that valuable practical ?
essay. ?'
More attention I know ought to be bestowed
on the ground on which wheat is n
sown, than we generally do. Fallow land r
is best for wheat. If it is well broken up,
and the wheat well put in with a shovel i<
plough, and the ground made level and tl
smooth with a harrow or roller, I think we t'
should hear little complaint of the Hes- h
* sian fly; Few will, however, for the pre- a
sent, take so much pains. Our Society is r
intended to encourage improvement, and 0
i hope some one will try this suggestion.

Wheat ought to be sown on clay soil,
nd never later than the 1st or 2d week in r<
)ctober: still earlier would, I think, be ir
letter. Twenty bushels of cotton seed to it
very acre will give to the crop a fine heal- ai
hy and vigorous state. I incline to think h
hat a top dressing about the 1st of March, ti
if about 5 bushels to the acre of slacked es
shes would greatly improve the crop. 1
ave never tried it on wheat, but I know ci
hat it is a great benefit to cultivated ci
rasses.
The crop of wheat ought to be cut be- e(
ore it is dead ripe: it should stand for 2 or c<
! days in ihe field in small shocks. If the tc
weather is dry, it may then be housed safe- ir
y. As soon as the crop is laid by, (about ai
he middle of July,) the wheat should be ti
hrashed out, cleaned, and well sunned, tl
)ne day's sun is scarcely ever sufficient.
i\vo successive days is generally enough, ai
take it up and put it away while hot rt
rom the sun; in the course of a few days si
forwards I commence to grind. In this ti
'ay my flour at the end ofa year is just as d<
ood as it was on the day on which it was fa
round. Good flourcan only be expected
om good wheat in good condition.?
Vhcn that is the case, a good mill, with Y
ood cloths and a skilful miller, can make ci
s good flour here, as can be made any f<:
'here. Many persons ruin their flour by in
esiring to have more than can be made, ol
ly father, whose long experience and e:
kill in the manufacture of flour is well si
nown, states that the following ought to ?
e the results of a well ground bushel of el
'heat, weighing GO lbs. One tenth, 6 lbs. | ta
lust be deducted for toll, one-sixth, 10 b<
3S. for bran?9 lbs. for middlings and ci
horts, which will make an aggregate of pi
5 lbs., leaving 35 lbs. of flour. From ni
'hich it appears, that a little Inss than 6 <1<
ushels, (say five and a half,) will make a Iti
arrel of flour weighing 192 lbs, neat. ti

Saving Cotton Seed. Much has been d
'ritten, and well written, on the impor- 2
incc of selecting, each year the best Corn
ii the fields for plantig. But so fur as we now,
there have been no experiments, in
electing carefully, the best Cotton stalks, lai
This subject seems to us to deserve more in
ttention than it has ever received. The tw
xperimentsin selecting seed Corn, prove pi
learly that a planter may moke lus^Corn at
onfnrmtoanv reasonable standard* Il.TI
s well known, that he can make his Corn'of
nature much earlier, by selecting the ju
arliest matured ears for seed, a few sue- wi
essive years. Why should not the same an
aws that produce this manifest improve- in
nent in Corn, from a careful selection of he
eed, effect a similar improvement in Colon?in
its earlier maturity, size of bolls,
fccIt
would certainly be attended with
ome trouble, but a very slight improve- 1
nent in each stalk of Cotton,(if this can pt
ie effected, by a careful selection of seed,)
vould make a tremendous increase of the m
ggregate quantity and qnality, of the w
vholecrop, and repay ten fold the labor a
if selecting good seed. h?
NoPlanter or Gardener need be told, that w
he stand he is to have, depends greatly on w
he sound, healthy condition of the seeds m
le plants. And when we consider the it
nanner in which the great majority of
Jotlon planters save their seed, is it at all
urprising that there should be no outcry, .
lmost every spring, that it is hard to gel j"
i good stand? If this can in a great mea- '
ure be remedied, by a careful selection e
ind preservation of seed; it would cost ro
ar less to take a litte extra trouble; in
aving good seed than to replant for a hl
;ood stand. ae
But not only the stand, but after-growth, w
igor, maturity and productiveness of any or
ilant, depends materially on the sound "~
nd mature condition of the seed planted.
Sound philosophy, and long experience ce
trove this, beyond all doubt. Let Plan- ?*
ers compare their methods of saving Cot- 80
on Seed for planting, with this well es- m
ablished principle of vegetation, and we ot
hink he will be convinced, that the want
if a stand, in the spring, and a large por- I
ion of his puny unproductive stalks, in ahc
summer and fall, are owing more to 1
he condition of the seed he plants, than gi
o the seasons.?Temperance Advocate, ro

Signs of better Times.?1. All agri- bl
ultural produce commands a fair, steady, m
ompensating price, alike removed from in
he depressed stale which sometimes has ne
xisted, or the unnatural inflatation through
vhich we have just passed. an
2. Speculation has had its day, and the ga
housands who have been ruined, have had ^
ime to repent at their leisure. The mass ol]
f the nation are convinced that honest
nduslry, and slow and sure profits, are
ir preferable to the haphazard and de- 0
moralising influence of such haste to be c
l an
ich.
3. Agriculture, it is evident, is assum- ca
ig its proper place in the estimation of tei
he public. This may be attributed in part
u the knowledge respecting it, which has
een distributed by agricultural journals, Pc
nd in part to the results of the agricultu- in
al census, the results of which have de- on
nonstrated the paramount importance of of
hjs interest
4. We find evidence that the mass of [
jading men begin to think and demand
lformation on the subject of agriculture,
i the fiict that ail our leading newspapers t
rid most influential journals, arc in the I
libit of devoting a part of their publica- i
ons to the dissemination of papers inter- I
sting to the farmer. t
5. In success of farming, yearly advan- J
js are making. We have this year seen
rops of the heaviest growth, where, on- 1
' a few years sinc?, a quaking bog exist, t
J; better and more productive kinds of t
irn and other grain have been brought t
i notice; the culture of roots has been ^
itroduced, and found a most important I
uxiliary to the farmer;, and more attenon
is paid to the cleaning of land, and p
le destruction of weedv, than formerly, t
6. Superior breeds of cattle, sheep
id swine have been introduced, and are c
ipidly spreading over the country; in ?
lort, the elements of individual and na- c
onal prosperity were never more fully
sveloping themselves than now. Let the b
rmer be thankful. n

Agricultural Statistics.?The N
. Journal of Commerce publishes a cal- n
ilation, by which it appears that nearly e
>ur bushels and a half of wheat are rnlsed v
i the United Stales for each inhabitant; b
f other grain nearly thirty bushels to i
tch inhabitant; and of potatoes, about
x bushels and a half to each inhabitant ii
making an aggregate of forty-one bush- 1
s of grain and potatoes to each inhabi- ii
nt, including men, women and children, ii
->nd and free. The value of an annual e
op of grain and potatoes, even at the t
resent low prices, is not, (says the Jour- p
il) less than three hundred millions of
illlars; and if we include other agricul- s
iral. productions, among which are col- n
>n and tobacco, wilh a fair allowance v
?r the cattle, sheep, horses, swine, &c., ie
hich belong to the year, we shall havej

DREADFUL DISASTER: t
We have this afternoon to record a no- i
her dreadful disaster by fire on Lake Erie, i
?y which, so far as accounts have reached t
is upwards of one hundred and seventy lives* r
iave been lost, by the destruction of t|ie i

he present on the Chicago line. She left n
his afternoon with a large invoice of dry n
[oods and hardware. The Erie never
ooked better than at present.
The above paragraph is all we have in v
wint. For the following we are indebted v
o private sources. . a

eived a letter this morning from H. R. s
leymour, Esq., of Buffalo, on the outside c
f which is the following endorsement:? tl
' Tuesday, 8 A. M., steamboat Erie was i<
timed last night, near Silver Breek, and k
>nly 17 out of 200 saved. Cupt. Titus is o
lere." e
Passengers who arrived in the city this ii
noming alate that the accidr .t was caus- (
d by the bursting of a carboy of vitrol, "5
/hich had been shipped as part of the e
aggage nf some painters, who were on g
heir way to paint a new steamboat* ' o
When the Erie left Buffalo it was blow- tl
ng a fresh gale, and it is added that Capt. t!
^itiis. her commander, was averse to leav- a
ag port, but the De Witt Cliniion hav- (
ng departed, it is belived lie was inflti- c
need thereby, and after waiting some c
wo hours, got his boat under way, and t
iroceedcd up the lake. q
About 8 o'clock the carboy burst, and t
et fire to the baggage, and in a few mo- t
nents, being fanned by the strong breeze f
rhich was theft blowing, the boat was i
nveloped in flames. e
In the desperate state in which the pas- v
engers were placed, they had only the s
Iternaiive of being burned to death or t
umping overboard, meeting death in a no- a
her form, each grasping at any thing i
hey could lay hold of to support them in 1
he water. s
Those who were saved were picked up i
>y the De Witt Clinton, which had put t
nto Dunkirk, some ten or fifteen miles t
urther up the lake, and which, on see- t
ng the Erie on fire, hmtt?nrl ih? m. j
ief of the" sufferers. |
We belice that the boat, when the fire a
wns first discovered, was about twenty- t
i^e miles from Buffalo. The Erie was (
>ne of ihe best boats on the lake, and
2apt. Titus a very popular commander.
We shall to-morrow expect further par- '
iculars, as Capt. Titus, it appears, was (
imong those who escaped. Mean time {

THE WEDDING FINGER. t
There are few objects among the pro- ?
luctions of art contemplated with such t
ively interest.by ladies, after a certain r
ige, as the wedding ring. This has been c
he theme of poets of every calibre; for r
jeniuses of every wing from the dueling ^
o the solar eagle. The mouldy antiquary a
;an tell the origin of the custom with (
vhjch it is connected, and perchance
vhy a ring is round, and accounts for ,
nany circumstances concerning the cerenony
of the circlet, on the most conclu- 1
ive evidence, amounting to absolute con- c
ectural demonstration. Amidst all that 1
r
las been said and written in reference to
he ring, 1 believe the more lovely part
ingaged in the mystic matter?the taper
esidence of this ornament, has been neg- t
