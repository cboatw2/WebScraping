WASHINGTON, May 13.
The rumor. of changes in the Cabinet
have already subsided, though some dis
contents, express the opinion thathir. Van
Buren's interests would be -promoted by
the formation of a newcabinct.
Some say that Mr. Niles, of Connecti
cut, the late senator from that State, is to
take the Post Office Department, but the
provailing opinion is that this officer should
bd taken from the West.
The bankrupt bill was taken up in the
Senate, yesterday, and the discussion was
commenced upon it.
The bill reported by Mr. Clayton, from
'the.majority of the Committee of the Ju
diciary, is a voluntary system, applying
only to individuals. Mr. Walls' bill from
.the minority, embraces both the compul
sory and the voluntary systems, and ap
plies to artificial as well as natural per
,sous-to banks and all other corporate
.bodies.
Mr. Wall opened the debate by a spiri
ted attack on the majority bill-declaring
that it was a partial and unequalimeasure,
inasmuch as it extended its benefits only
to the debtor class of the commuaity, with
out affording any protection to creditors.
Mr. Clayton opposed the motion, and
went into an argument to shew that it was
unconstitutional and inexpedient to em
brace the banks.
The subject was laid aside for the pre
sent, and the Senate held a short execu
tive session.
The House took up the billtoensurethe
more faithful collection of the revenue from
customs, and several amendments were
offered to it, but rejected. The necessity
of preventing frauds, in order to protect
the revenue, which is alarmingly deficient,
at the best, was the chief argument in fa
vor of the arbitrary provisions of the bill.
Mr. Holmes, of S. C., spoke very ably
against the bill, contesting thelegality and
constitutionality of its provisions. The
previous question w's then ordered, and
the bill was finally passed by a vote of 122
.to 30.
May 14.
It is rumored that the Sub-Treasury bill
will be taken up to-day, in commitee of
the whole House. Tne discussion wi!l,
of course, be long and ardent. The op.
position will not let it go outof their grasp
these six weeks. But after that measure
shall be disposed of, the remaining busi
ness of the session will be speedily dis.
patched.
A1r, Adams' revenue bill was taken up
in the Senate. Mr, Adams followed the
bill himself to the Senate chamber, where
he endeavored to have it referred to the
Committee on Manufactures. Mr. Web
ster said the bill ought to go to the Judi
ciary Committee or the Committee on
Manufactures. Mr. Calhoun showed,
however, that it came clearly within the
jurisdiction of the Committee on Finance,
and to that committee it was referred. It
will meet with much opposiion in the
Senate, and especially From Mr. Calhoun.
But, as an administration measure, it may
pass. Some such hill ought to pass. but
the maitin objection to this bill, is that it in
fringes on individual rights.
The Bankrupt bill was ably discussed
in the Senate, by Messrs. Crittenden and
Wall. Mr. Crittenden supported the vol
untary system, as repor:ed by the majori
ty of the committee, and vindicated it
from the objections of Mr. WALL.
Mr. Wall vindicated his bill, but inti
mated that if the Senate would take his
bli as the basic of a law, they could then
strike out the provisins which wvere ob
jectionable. He wvished to test the sense
of the Senate upon each of the three fea
tures of his bill.
There is no doubt that Mr. Niles of
Connecticut, is to be appointed Post-Mas
ter General, and no doubt that it will be a
very unpopular appointment hereabouts.
It is strongly insisted also, that thisofficer
should have been taken from the W~est or
South.
May 15.
-The House was occupied the whole day
with the question of privilege, growing
out of the affray between Rice Garland
and Jesse A. Brnum. Trhe report of the
facts by the Select Committee was taketn
up. and Mr. Underwood, the Chairman,
moved sundry resoluti ms for the punish
mient of disorder and personal violence in
future. Mr, Wall contended that the
House had no rules that would reach the
case, and that any proceeding against the
parties wrouldi be export facto. His mo
lion was decided to be out of order, and
Mr. Holmes, of S. C. then offered a reso
lution declaring that Jesse A. Bynuma atnd
Rice Garland, by fighting in the House,
had committed-a gross breach of its digni
ty, and ought to lie immediately expelled,
Nir. Jenifer, of Md. advocated the motion,
and insisted that the expulsion of the lpar
ties was due to the insulted dignity of the
House, and to the character of the coun
try. He hoped the House would have
the courage to meet tho question. Ho
would not stop to inquire who struck the
first blow. WVhoever took redress into his
own hatids, itnstead of relying upon tho
House for protection. was equally cenlpa
ble. Mr. Proffit, of Indiana, opposed the
motion. H e attributed all the disorder of
the Hotuse, to its disorganization at thme
opening of the sesion, amid considered the
whole H-ouse resptonsible for what had oc
cured, moreover, similar cases had hap
pened before, and had passed unnoticed.
He alluded to the case of Bell and Turney,
in the last Congress.
A motion was made to lay the whole
subject on the table, and lost ayes 75,
noes 106. After a long debate, it was
finally agreed to reccommit the wyholesub
ject to-the same committee with instruc
tions to inquire and seport wvhat should be
done in the matter. It is the general a
pinion that nothing will be done with the
parties, but that severe rules for such ca
ses wvill lbe adopted, for the future govern
ment ofthe House.
The bankrupt bill was again taken up,
antd Mr. Henderson, of Mississippi, spoke,
at-length, in support of the voluntary bank
rupt law, which he thought was all that
the country asked fur, anid all was re
quired.
He opposed the proposition to embrace
-lie bants, ne innenpeient and nnteittt
tional. ir. Wall replied and supported
his measure.
It has been determinated, by the ad
ministration members, to* bring up the
Sub-Treasury bill, at the earliest moment,
whieh will probably be next Tuesday.
May 1G.
The subject of the 'ates of public print
ing was resamed in the House yesterday,
Mr. Evans' motion to reduce the prices
twenty-five per cent was lost. The mo
tion of Mr. Black to reduce them fffteen
per cent was agreed to, yeas 155, nays 17.
Mr. R. Garland's motion to seperate the
printing from the public press was laid
on the table. So that the matter is dis
posed of.
Mr. Jones, of Va. made an inefflectual
attempt to suspend the rules, setting a
part this day fur private business, in order
to go into Committee of' the Whole, to
take up the Sub-Treasury Bill. It occa
sioned considerable sensation in the House
-many protested .against taaking up that
bil, until the Navy and Army Appropria
tion Bills were disposed of. The vote was
yeas 117, nays 83, and thus the motion
was lost, for want of the requisite two
thirds. But the vote indicates a large ma
jority for the bill.
The bill amendatory of the act for the
remission of dutics ont goods destroyed by
the great thie in the city of N. York was
taken up, and 31r. Rheit moved to extend
its provisions to all eases ofdestruction of
imported merchandize by fire. The pre
vious question was ordered, and the bill
was passed to a third reading. A motion
to recommit was made, but the previous
question was again moved, and the House
refused to order the main question to be
put-so Ite bin was thereby laid over for
one day. I think it will ultimately pass.
The origitihl act on this subject was so
much restricted, as to be utterly useless.
It has been a mere utility, for not one case
has been decided under it. No other hu
siness was done, though much time was
spent in calliag the House. No quortim
could be obtained and retained. This
will continue to be the ease in the House,
duritng the remainder of the session The
memberscannot be kept together half of
the time. The weather has become hot,
and the memtiers prefer the open air to a
crowded and badly ventilated hall.
The Senate again took tp the.Bankrupt
Bill, and Mr. Smiith, of Indiana. spoke at
great length, in support of the voluntary
systetm, as the measure best snited to the
condition of our people. and the otly act
for which they had petitioned. lieoppo
sed the proposition to inclide the banks,
declaring it to be the most high-hqnded and
dangerous assumption of power, on the
part of the Federal Government that was
ever yet attempted.
The disposition of Congress and of the
public, appears to be in favor of the volun
tary system alone; &it is very possible that
it may be adopted. It will be either that or
nomthing. Mr. Webster, it is supposed,
will address the Senate in full on the sub.
ject, next Monday or Tuesday.
The hill for the better protection of
lives of passengers inl vessels propelled in
whole or in part by steam, was taken up,
and some amendients proposed by the
author of the bill, (Mr. Ruggles,) were
agreed to. The further consideration of
the subject was theu postponed till Mon
day.
No nomination of a Post Master Gener
al has been yet sent to the Senate, and it
is rumored that Mr. Niles will not accept
the office.
May 17.
The Senate did not meet yesterday.
in the House, an unsuccessful effort was
made to reconsider the vote, by which the
resolution, red ucintg the price paid for pub
lic printing fifteen per cen't was, carried.
Thte object of the mover wvas to eff'ect a
reductiou of twenty per cent.
The bill amendintg the act remitting the
duties on goods destroyed by fire int the
city of New York, was read a third time,
and then rejected--yeas 60, nays95. One
of the friends of the bill had voted in thte
negative for the p)urpose of moving a re
consideratIon, of which he gave ntotice.
Ini order, therefore, to bring the matter to
a close, Mr. mtoved to re-considecr the vote,
and the motion was rejected. So, the bill
is (lead, and the board of commissiotners
might as wvell be abolished; for they can
(to nodthinig uinder the oriciniat act. One
motive for~ rejecting the bill, was the ne
eecssities of the Treasury, and the appre
hension thtat a farther isstte of Treasttry
notes, otr a loan, may be made requisite
before the termination of the present ses
sion. For the same reason, the H-ouse
will refuse to pass to anty private bills,
whicht in volvye applropriations of~ money.
This is tuojtst and dlishonest towards the
public creditors; for the country is nor
yet bantkrupt, whatever the Treasttry may
be, and as long as wye have the meatts, our
just debts ought to be paid. This truism
will not, however, he recognized during
the present stuggle of parties for populari
ity atnd power.
The House went into Committe on pri
vate bills, but refused, as they did on Fri
day, to act on any of them. It is idle to
waste time, therefore, by setting apart
two days itt thte week for private business,
andt~ the rtules otuht to lbe c:hanged.
Bets are madel htere, every (lay, on thte
presidential election. The whigs bet free
ly, not onily on thte general restult, but on
nearly every state in the Union. They
will not even concede South Carolina to
air. Van Bitren, nutwithstanding the late
demonstration there. They say that S.
Carolinta will hrowv away her vote.
Mr. Van Buren's confidence in his re
election is. I am told, undimintishied.
Judge Hanson, in a bpeech before the

MoVEMENT OF TirE-DEtoCRA'IC PARTY.
-We lay before the country the proceed

at Baltimore. The speeches, of which
our Reporter gave hasty sketches have
been drawn out at length, and -submitted
to the revision of the speakers. The ad

doubt not, to speak the sentiments of the
Democracy of the whole Union, with a
fideliry and frankness that will -commend
it to every lover ofliberal institutions.
That it will find acceptance with the
Democracy every w-here, we have the
most gratifying proofs in the manifesta

of New York. We have received the

by the highest intellectual force-a force
now deriving an uncontrollable influence
from the all-pervading feelings of party,

If perchance Gen. Harrison should be
elected Chief Mlagistrate of the Union, of*
which, however, the possibility every hour
diminishes, and nearlv simultaneouily with
this event, there should be a restoration of
commercial confidence, what credit would
not the Whigs take to themselves far their
vaticinations. Hlere they wonld exclaim
is a triumphant proof of otr averment that
the monied and mercantile difficulties into
which the country has latterly.been pluni
fred are attributable to Mi-. Van. Buren's
administration. An accidental cbrjunction
of circumstances would be, in this manner,
adduced as evidence that it .9xibited the
necessary connexion of cause and efct.
That which the natural operation of
events is gradually ell'eting would be
assigned to a change of administration.
This could have no influence, of course,
with any but those who look beyond the
surface of things; ir it effects the purposes

From the Georgia .'Jrgus4,
THE COMMITTEE
We publish to-day a letter addressed to Gen.
Harrison, from Oswego,And the reply to it by
his committee. We commend it to the espe
cial attention of our readers. It is altogether
the most remarkable document that has ever
fallen under otr notice.
Since the establishment of this Government,
ithas beenanestablished-1.-,ie that the peo
ple had the right to ask at the hands of those who
were seeking to he intrusted with power an ex
pression oftheir opinions upon all subjects con
nected with the public interests. That thisdoc
trine should be maintained, with an unimpaired
force, and that every man in the country should
fel that there rests upon every candidate a sa
crud ned parartmonit obligation to answer, is
of the deepest importance to the best interests
of the conitry. The people have a right to
know of a can'didate what are his opinious, that
they may be enabled to judge wihether their
views and opinions are to be properly represen
ted; and whether their rights and interests are
to be preserved or destroyed.
Heretofore, in the whole history of the Gov
ernment. there has not been found a single in
stance within onr knowledge, where a candi
date for the suffrages of tltc people has dared to
refuse to give such information, when required.
To Gen. Harrison it has been reserved to tmake
this fearfuil inroad upon these principles of our
Government-to htn has been reserved the
odions task of declaring in substance to the
people of this country, that they are destitute of
the tmtelligence necessary tojudge what is for
their interest, and to determine what principles
are correct. To him has been reserved the
task of asking the the people of these United
States notto trouble themselves about princi
ples-not to ask him to declare his principles,
lest they may be dissatisfied ith them; but leave
to him the exposition of the great text book of
their potitical faith, to repose in him that "gen
erous confidence" which will be satisfied with
the belief that he knows better than themselves
what will be for their good, and that he will take
care of their rights and interests. And this
comes from the honest, frank old republican
soldier, of theJeffersoniatn school. Even Jack
son with all his willingness to "take the res
sponsibility," never dared take such a respon
bility as tlis. Mattin Van Buren the tnagician

Ianiflestiig ta siflicientlv Igenerous confidence"
whCn th11 should trust to his honesty to carry
theni out; btt this is not sutiicient for 'Gen. flar
rison and his party; they have not confidence
enoutghm in the intelligence or the honesty ofthe
people, to trtust to them a disclostire of his
printciples; and yet, theyask of this same peo
ple to mnaniifest for him that blind devotion,
whiii shall intrust to their keeping the ri lit of
thinkiina for thiemu, and carrving ont opiniots
and principles. which they will not proclaim.
Other politicians have professed to be anxious
to have their principles tnmurrstood; to lay them
out before the people, that they might invesii
gate and decide upon their merits. If this were
the mere whim of a ian who thonght propel
to ptt himselufp as candidate for the Presiden
ev; orofa few,lfoolish advisers, who inight think
liroper to take him into keeping. thuii it
woiti destroy every claimn to the confidence
and the sutitratges of the people, and would en
tirely dcmolib every hope of success; vet, it
woild present nothing to alarm the friettds of
our instituttions. Bit this is int the case. Ile
is emphatically tile can'didateof a party seeking
power, for over's sake-not because they
seek to vindicate fromi ahnse the principles
iupon which the Government was established,
atd halt party not only sanctioned. but we miay
Iirly imfer. have poiited fnt and direr-ted lte
adoptioni ofil tis course. That committee say:
-T-hc committee are streitgthened in regard to
the propriety of his policy, that no new isue
lie made to the public, froin the consideration,
that the National Convention deemed it itupoli
tic at the then crisis, to publish any geneal dec
laration of the great opposition policy, amid cer
t-iuly 'the policy at the present remains unal
tered."
Taking together then, all these circuistan
ces, it is but fair to infer that the Conven
tion, not only sanctions, bitt directed this policy:
and when n% e see in this country, a great aud
powverful party, setkintg to get into their hatids
the whole power of the country, aind to
aid thmemi in effecting it, reptndiatinigone of
the fundaimental priniciples ,of outr goven
metit; wvhen we see theim setting tip the doc
trine, that policv forbids that the peopleshall he
made acqutaitied with the opinmiotis atnd prn
ciples ofone, who is seekinig through thieir aufh
frages, a stattion, which places the destiny of the
country ini his hands; we think it iih time that
every inan who feels any interest ii'the wellitte
or tile honor of the country, should begin to in
quirec why it is, that the usage which has been
sanictified by the opinion and example. of every
good aman ini the counttry, until it has becoime
ntterwoveni with the fouindarmental pr-inciples
of our governmetnt, shotuld now btesetat naught.
In counttries where meni come itnto piower by
hereditary succession, where the people have
ntoting to d o with choosing them, whlere their
title to'nower depenids upon their birth, and
tot upe their princdiles; where the rights and
mtterests of the peoIple, are to be consulted in
the chioic-e of ruler-s; it ttight perha ps lbe consid
ered imphroper. and impertinent for the pleople
to be imuiring into suicht matters, hut in a
connttre- like this. where every man has a voice
itt thechtoieof the public servants, and wvhere
in 'arder to vote uinderstatnditngly, lhe muistknowv
the opinionis ofthouse between whom the choice
is to lbe nirue. such doctges canntot for a mu
mietit be.tolerated-whieiievcr it cat i be, the right
ofsuitirage biecomes a fooling mockery.
The committee says, "sneh course has been
adopted,not for purposes of concealment-not to
avoid any respotnsibility; but under the impres
sion, that the General's views in regard to all
the important and exciting questions of the day,
have heretofore been given to the public, fully
andexplicitly; and that these views, whether
connteeted with constitutional or other questionsu
of very general interest, have unudergotie no
ehatige." Now~, supposing this to be uruie, what
excuse does it afford for refisinig to answer those
wh-Io may not be in possession of a knowledge
of these opinions.

CIcXCIZATI, Feb. 29, 1840.
Oswego Union Association:
GENTLcufEN.-Your lettter of the 31sI
ult. addressed to General Harrison, has
been placed in our possesion with a view
to early attention. This is unavoidable
in consequence of the very nunerous let
ters daily received by the General, and to
which his reply in person is rendered ab
solutely impracticable. As from his confi
dential commitee, you will look upon this
response, and if the policy observed by
the committee should not meet with your
approbation you will attribute the error
rather to ourselves and his immediate ad
visers, than General Harrison. That poli
cy is that the General make no further
declaration of his principles, for the public
eye, whilst occupytng his present position.
Such course has been adopted not for pur
poses of concealment, nor to avoid any re
sponsibility; bt under the impression that
the General's views, in regard to all the
importantand exacting qluestions of the
day, have heretofore been given to the
public fully and explicitly; and th-at those
views, whether connected with constitu
tional or other questioas of very general
interest, have undergone no change. The
committee are strengthened in regard to
the propriety of his policy; that no new is
sue be inade to the public, frorn the con
sideration that the national convention
deemed it impolitic at the then crisis to
publish any general declaration of the
great opposition party, and certainly the
policy at the present remains unaltered,
In the meantime, we cannot help expres
sing the hope that our friends every where
will receive the no.mination of General
Ilarrison with somet hing akin to generous
confidence. When we reflect upon the dis
tinguished intelligence of the nomiutiting
cotivenion hpcw ably all interests were
represetted in that body; we certainly have
a high guarantee, that, shotld General
llarrison be the successful candidate for the
Presidency, that oflice will tie happily and
constittiionally adhinttisiered, and under
the guidance of the satie printcipeisC which
directed our Washingtton, Jell'erion, and

time to desei ibe, nor space in our paper for the
details of this brilliant shooting match; suffice
it to say that the target was well perforated and

were fired, while good humor, harmony, and
the proper spirit of rivalry, without jealousy

AttRIv.L OF TIE BRITstt QUEEN.-The

ihatit was likely so to remain. There
had alio been a revival of trade in the

to purchase rreely, with the view of laying

ma~rks: "It is with heart felt satisfacions
we fink that that the delicate and diffienlt

to pay her 3E200.000, or about halfa amil

joice in this compromise,-not so muclh
because it is, or is not, a good bargain in
itself, as because it removes a bone of' con
tention whlich has bung existed, and the
right to wvhich each party has claimed with
so much confidence, that it was impossiblo
