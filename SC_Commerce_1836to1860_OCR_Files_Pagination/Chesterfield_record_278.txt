Edrtot,-*-I have been planting for
the last ten years and I have just now come
to the determinat on to plant less, and mamire,
fori find out,from dearly bought ei
perience, that it is a bad plan to plant largely,
and not manual for no planter can find
good reasons to support him in planting
largely and not manuring. What is tlx?
reason that we find so many going to the
West? 1 think ifwc were ;o Ask reasons
of most of those who go from South Cairo,
lina to the Went, they would s?y that their
lands are worn out. Well, now wo will ask
tbem how is it that their lands came to be
wocrnoutl 1 think that they would say that
they had been planting largely, and not
manuring at all. f I dont thmk, Mr. Editor
that y?0 will find a planter who has got in
the Way of manuring, selling off and going
?e the West. Why sir? Because l>e has found
OUt) that it is easier to manure One acre,
than to tut down one acre and clean it up,
and then he loses his crop oh the-one acre
that is cleaned up, when, from the acre that
ia manured, he has every reason to .calcu..
late on acrop, if something more than com.*
mon does not happen, 1 will advocate the
manuring system so far as fa say, that I do
believe that in nine out of ten years, you
wifimeke a crop on manured ground. I
am satisfied that the up-Coun'ry plan er
plants oncthird more than he ought to plant
-*-I think. I might sny twice as much as
he ought. And now Sir, what is t'le reason
of it / "One of the reasons is ihis-^-his ne gh.
bor plants largely, and he th nks that he
must do what-his neighbor is doing, or he
is doing nothing.^ Ho will sometimes plant
more than his neighbor, to have it said that"
heis oat-crOp ing hi th. Now, sir, they are
both wrong; and if you ask them both if
they am not wrong in planting so much,
they will tell you that they ahp. -Ask them
if they do not believe that one acre fnanured,will
make twice as much as one not manured,
and I think they will answer ybW:1r>
the -affirmative/- Bur candidly "speaking,
fiff/Edftoly- 1 "d? believe tfirit"there is not a
i
set-of people who stand more in their own I
light, t;:an the planters ; for, sir, they know j
that they can make more by manuring, titan ,
they can by planting largely, and yet they
will still persist in what they know to be
wrong. But some of them will tell you that
they have not got time to make manure. I '
am very sorry for any op-country planter
who has not got time to make manure, for
I am satisfied that if any planter has time
to make manure, I say that it is the upcountry
planter. If they wiJ: take twothirds
of their hands, with a wagon, as soon
us they are done pick.ng cotton, and go
into the woods and gather leaves, and haul
them into a pen, and put their cows on
them the next snmmer, I think they will
agree with mo in saying, that thev have
time, and I am satisfied that they will be so
well paid for their trouble, that they will the
next year, spend more time at it. thao they
did this year. I last winter raked trash but
one fortnight, with about seven hands, and
with that and tho corn stalks of about 25
acres of corn, I have made manure enough
-?c,. ??0Kl? th*? limn. I am so well

paid, that I will this winter spend a month,
with as many or more hands, making trash.
I will give a more particular account of the
manuro I made this year, at some other
time.

feet long; measure off at the small end
the usual length of (lie yoke, and bore the

to be supplied with the bpst teachers, and to j

farms, upon different soils, and Mn different <
sections of the kingdom, to be under the dt? i
roction of tho best practical men. In the
college the scientific theory of the art is to I
be taught, and the explanations of the differ, i

abroad io.be given.?The pr cftcal instruc.

both by science and practice, and detailing 1
to each other, for the general benefit,: theJ4
results of reflection and experience." 'If 1
ever such an institution be established/* '
says a writer in the Farmers'' Maga2iBS> 1
44 the first step must be, to kick?sheer over- 1
board, the prejudices of men and ^o level '

of iuc world. On every subjeet, "tt#Ergreater
part of mankind are biassed in fbvw of
some particular way of thinking* tind way
of performing any operation iwhich they
have adopted, and to which thdy have been
accustomed, and of which very few are
ever able to divest themselves.' Prejudice 1
completely obscures our perceptive and in.'
tuitivo powers, clogs our understanding,'and
perverts our judgment, and rendets wholly,
useless the reasoning faculty conferred upon
us as the distinguishing characteristic efour 1
nature. No sound judgment be^e#- 1
ercised on any subject, or a satisfactory 1
conclusion arrived at, where this pernicious
propensity prevails : no dependence can be
placed on the opinion of any man, who allows
his judgment to take precedence of his
reason, and whose mind is wilfully shut1-J
against conviction.?For the furtherance of 1
any art, the great essential desideratum is '
to combine theory and practice; and on '
this point the agricultural world (with some
splendid exceptions,) has floundered over
head and ears in the mud. It is only
of lath years, that our mechanics and man* '
ufacturers have bet*n able to combine them ;
but until that be effected, and as much as
possible in the same per>ons, or by different
persons being in constant and friendly
intercourse, it is very evident the progress
will bo slow. If properly established and
conducted, incalculable benefits might accrue.
The members of the college must

every branch of education connected with

I agnounuic, u;iu one iiioruuguiy versea in
! agriculture itself, and their employment
would be to draw suggestions from the investigations
of science, to be transmitted to
the farms for the test of experience, Tho
conductors of these farms must be the most
intelligent practitioners that can "be found
for the soils they are intended to manage ;
thoroughly acquainted wi.h arabfe (arming
j and the suitable implements ; our differ.,
ent breeds of stock ; intelligent and open
to, and able to comprehend, and abla to execute,
the suggestions transmitted to them
from the central college. Until we have a
field of tests, we do not know what invaluable
discoveries may be hid in suggestions
laughed at and neglected, or in those that
may be made. That great dbstifdity has
attended many of them, must be readily
granted ; but the wheat cannot be obtained
without separating it from the cheffj' .i
Thus far our extract. Thete'fs no truth
more palpable, than that science, to benefit
agriculture as it has benefitted the arts, must
be associated and combined with its practical
labors, as it has been profitably combiu..
ed with the labors of the" nrtizan and manufaturer.
And we are of opinion that this
would be more efficiently done, in a school
and firm inthc ?:?rne foeation, than It could'

hat an acquaintance of his had recently
taen to Mansfield township, Connecticut,
irith a view to procure the Services of a
noting woman skilled in the managing of

be benefit of the knowledge they have
icquired, at compensations of from $20 to

The venerable Matthew Carey, nod othei

have been laboring for years to place
female labor on a better footing, with very
partial success. The fact mentioned above
wems to go far to prove that tho silk busi.
less is likely to do great things towards
bringing about a result so very desirable.
We are pleased to see the business making
rapid progress tn our village and neighbor,
hood, and doubt not it will b j every way
beneficial to the community. We shall
?ive more particulars as to its his'ory, when
we have becomO somewhat better acquainted
with its details, of which we now feel con.
strained to confess oar ignorance.
Although the remedy recommended in
the following article is not new. yet good
may lesuh from publishing it with respecta.
ble attestation of its efficacy. Our medical
readers, for whose benefit we copy it, will
perceive that tho cases in which it proved
effectual, were not confirmed consumption ;
[fiat is the body of the lung was not ulce.
rated. But in most if not all the casos,
pulmonic consumption and death might
have been the result of neglect or improper
treatment. Ed. Ch. Gaz.
From tto V. Y. Commercial Ailvortiser. . .
The late lamented death of Dr. Bu?l?, .
from that form of consumption known as
chronic bronchitis, painfully reminds me of
a duty to bis profession and to society, of
making known a simple form of treatment
that has never failed htm in curing this form
oi consumption, so destructive to the clerical
and literay profession. This treatment
is of nearly equal efficacy in catarrhal
pkthisv;. and is a valuable remedy for con.
sumption in all its forms, when ia its chronic
stages, and from any inflammatory symp.
tomes. This treatment is based on the pathology
of consumption, as tlio generic
name for disease.
Under the name of consumption are in.
eluded that variety of diseases of the lungs
attended with ^expectoration of purulent
matter from tho breathing surface of the
lnn*a k iiAnivAAfA/1 tuith omnpiotinn hrr?hr*
luugO| v^uMMvy^u nivu tiwuv
fever, and its concomitants, night sweats,
colliquative diarrhoea, <3tc. All the forms
of consumption act on the general henith
front one Common cause?the presence of
matter acting upon absorbing surfaces, and
thus producing those symptoms known as
hectic fever. It is the presence and violence
of this symptom of consumption that
prostrates the patient, until it more or less
slowly ends in death. It is the consequence
of this hectio fever, and not the immediate
disease Of the lungs causing it, that forms
the source of fatality from consumption.
The treatment 1 now, with reluctant diffidence,
submit, I have successfully used for
more than 12 years, nnd dnring this period
of medical psactice, I am not aware of hav.
ing lost more than four or five patients from
all' the various forms of consumption, arid
Ifcese were mostly passed to that stage of
disease where the structure of the lungs had
become so oxtensively diseased as to preclude
tho use of more than palliative treatmenu
~ Cases of chronic brochitis were, in
...AMf ? 1 L.. *4 A**AM lldion tKo
cvcijf iuguiuv;C) curt'U uy a viuii whvii ??*v
purulent expectoration amounted to pints
daily, with hectic fever, diarrhoea, cold
sweats and entire physical prostration.
The treatment is the administration of
sulphate of copper in nauseating doses,
combined with gumammoniac, given so as
to nauseate, but not ordinarily to produce
full vomiting; the usual dose for this pur.
pose is about half a grain, and five grains of
the respective ingredients,* in a teaspoonful
of water, to be taken at first twice, and
in the convelescent state once a day.
In cases of chronic bfochitis a gargle of
the sulphate of copper alono is superadded.
In this latter form of consumption this treatment
almost invariably suspends the hec.
tic symptom in a few days, and the uisease
rapidly advances to its final cure.
In cases of the more proper forms of con.
sumption the treatment must be intermitted
frequently and again returned to; ahd whenever
soreness of the chest, or other symptoms
of inflamatory action exist, the treat,
ment should so suspended, as it is in the
ceronic state alone that the remedy is indicated
or useful?that state in which the
condition of the general system as sympathetically
involved becomes tbe more prominent
symptom, and the success of the treat,
ment depends chiefly upon the breaking- up
of this aympntheftc Sdfio'ri oT the diseased
* y ? - ? r r**1
i
ling, on the more healthy tone of the stom.
ich, and increasing itsdigestivepowers, and
ikfwise causing, during nauseating action
t more active and healthy circulat on of
ilood through the lungs. Its curative powrs
are more immediately atiributablo to
h".se cff rts ofits action. Bu^hcory opart,
iie treatment is presented based on more
h in ten years' experience of its curative
idvantages, in the prop r ireatovnt of mucopurulent
and purulent expectoration.
Having left a profession tint more n? arly
han any other approaches the pure duties
>f humani y, but which has nearly ceaspd
n this country to be honorable or profitable,
have lit le motive in exposing myself to
hat certain rdicule that follows the annuniution
that consumption may be cured, but
lie assurance of prac ionl exp"nen< e,'and
he desire of making public a nieans ofsav i
ng life, in one ofits most frequent and unvelcoine

and Presidents and Directors of the several

eiltCCLAB.
Fellow Citizens .'?Interested like ytftti"*
iclvee, in the cultivation and disposal of the
p*eat staple of American agriculture and comnerce,
we have accidentally met in this city,
n the midst of a crisis which discloses some
strikingly momentous features in the history
A this most important branch of the trade of
>ur country.
When the Cotton Crop of the United States
?ac a mnre* item in its trade, and did not reach
i production exceeding five hundred thousand
tales, it was perhaps safe to consider it as one
imong many articles of barter and exchange,
which, left entirely to the fortuitous circum- ,
stances of commerce, would find its level un
ler the influence of the ordinary laws of trade,
without the necessity of resorting to any
means of precautionary protection.
Time*, however, have changed. Cotton
lias passed from the condition of a mere article
)f commerce, to the performance of the mighty
function of being in a great degree the regulator
of the exchanges, and the standard of
value of our country. If the nature of this
material forbids its entering into our cir:ulation,
it is scarcely less tne b. sis of our
:urrency, than the precious metals; for the
Suctuations in its price are felt wit * a *ensi~
bility equally as acute and searching, as any
af thoso variations which be ong to the demand
and supply of these sensitive and mysterious
tokens of nation*! value.
The production of this staple, has now be.
rorae so imraonee, that it behooves tho*e who
produce it by a large investment of capi'al at
a high rate of incidental cost, and in a climate
perilous to human health, to consider well,
whe her there are not some material circumBtancf
s in reference to the mode in which this
product of their labor is shipped from this
countiy, and is brought to market at tho point
of i's final 6alo and consumption, which demand
the application of a prompt and effective
remedy. In one word, is not the important
fact disclosed, that such is the unwieldJy
amount of this great staple of Southern industry,
that it cannot be sent forward and disposed
of at fair remunerating prices, through the
ordinary medium of the mercantile establish-*
ments of this country and in Europe, without
the diract cooperation of our banking institu**
tiens 1 If we have become satisfied of this
fact, ought we Dot to organize a system, which
shall give perfect security to this great interest
in the commerce and finances of our country
? The unwise and ruinous system of sending
tho crop forward to houses ofcircumscribed
means, on the other side of the water* who
are incapable of holding their consignments an
hour beyond the maturity of the bills drawn
4gatn*t such yhipfnents, au'*ject in f tct,'nomrly
the whole amount of American interest to foreign
combination, which might act, not only
with entire concert, but with a perfect knowledge
of the period, when from the maturity of
the acceptances in question, property to a stupendous
amount belonging to this country,
may be ready for sacrifice.
The great and vital change which must be
operated, is to sustain American interests, by
American cred t. To realize pt home, the
resources necessary for the protection of our
property abroad without the necessity of large
and inconvenient drafts on. the capital and

our great staple to market, without the period
being determined by the date of a Dili of
Exchange, when it is to be brought forward
for absolute arid unnecessary sacrifice. We
believe that the steadiness in price, which
would result from a portion, at least, of the
Cotton crop being exempt from the disastrous
fluctuations arising from compulsory sales,
would in the end, be scarcely less valuable to
the spinner and consumer in England, than
to the grower and shipper here. A fact, which
we think demonstrable from the following postulates,
which we consider altogether self-evident:
1. The natural price of Cotton is the effect
of the fair and natural influence of supply and
demand. , ; 5 .
2. The price cannot be steady, and the article
cannot be current, so as to admit of safe
calculations on the part of the planters, the
manufacturer and the merchant, unless the
price bo natural. It is consequently the interest
of these three classes, that the article
should be protected, on the one hand from any
great and undue speculative action, which
might inflate prices above the natural rate?
and on the other, f-om any derangement in the
ftinh-u market, or anv other accidental cause.
which might d press it below that rate. The
effect of great and undue speculation being to
derange th * money market, and to produce
reaction, with an undue depression of prices.
3. The state of the currency inamly depends
on the means which the country posses.
seSj to pay it* foreign debt, by shipmeuta of
its produce. To the extent its produce or
manufacture falls short of that object, exports
of specie may be induced, the effect of which
must be a reduction of the circulation, with
depreciation of property and general distress.
4. Cotton, in this country, being by far the
most important produce, and affording the
great means of paying its foreign debt, it is the
interest of the commnnity, and particularly
of the monied inst tutions, that he price of it in
England, (the great market,} should be steady
and that the article should be of current 6ale,
so as to be the means of large arid effective
remittance, t fullowsi that the interest of the
banking institutions here, are the same as the
three classes first mentioned, namely, that the
price should be nutural, that it may be steady,
and of easy realization.
5. The interest of the British Government,
of the Bank of England, and of the banks of
that country in respect tothis article, are the
same as the interests of the hanks here. The
importation there being immense, and the
employment of a most norrerous body of the
laboring classes, depeningon the steadiness of
prices. When they are not steady?the foreign
demand for manufacturad co'ton is reduced
greatly, the operatives are thrown out
of employment, and tho great means of sett!ing
the balance of trade, without the exportation
of the precious metals are withdrawn.?
Manufactured cottons affording by far, the
most important branch of their export"trade.
6. Consequenly, any arrangement that
could be formed, by' which the article jrould
be protected from the effects of undue specus
lation, and from depression in the money market,
and by which steadiness of 'price, with
currency of sale, woald be. promoted?would
save some of the greatest anil best interests
in both countries.
7. It is therefore proposed to form a system
by which, with the commencempnt of the new
crop, advances on Co ton eball be made with
the capita! or credit of Banks here, thereby rq.
1 lieving the consignee in Europe from ail career
consideration; except the advantageous-B ile of
his stoctT, which would promote all these inter- .
ests, And afford general satisfaction on both
sides of the water, provided it were not mace
the means directly or indirectly, of undue speculation
or monopoly...
Having thus indicated the m'nciples on
which th? proposed system must find m jjwti.*

Now we propose giving to the banks in all
capes the higher protection of these securities,
and that early next autumn, one or more banks in
each ofthe great -commercial' cbttop ma rfcet*1 of
the South should commence making advances on
the crop, tree rding to a scale to be graduated by
what will be a safe calculation of its probably amount,
assuming 12 ^.2. cents at home to be
about the fair natural average and temtlnf ating
price of this staple, oh a product *>f sliteen win*
dred thousand bates, which is about as lar.w a return
as the actual labor of the country now engaged
in this branch of industry, is capablo of
harvesting. The embarrassment of the Southwestern
States havipg nreveqte<Hbe planters in
these States from making any 'purchases of
slaves front the Atlantic States,,during the last
two years, whilst not loss than tea per cent, of
the slave labor of the South has bien abstracted
in the same period from the cultivation of cotton,
and applied to the raising of provisions, and td
the construction of those exclusive railroads now
in progress throughout that portion of the Union.
For these advances we propose that the banks
should issue to the p anters, merchants, and factors
ofthe country, on the production ofthe bill
of lading, and the assignment'of the policy, of in.
surance, post notes of such description, and pay*

contemplated may suggest, notes which may bd

This fellow citiiens, is but the. brief outline
of a great scheme, for the protection, of our,
commerce, finance, and exchanges, the details
which, must be left for profound deliberation
and concerted action. To accomplish^ tbui'
object, we hereby invite the planters, factors
and cotton merchants of each oisfrict or coun?
ty in the Southern Stater, and Territory of
Florida, together -with the bank*. in eaoh
of the Said States and Tei*itnQfr.,t# aynd
delegates to meet us in convention at if aeon.
Georgia, on the fourth Tuesday of October,
next, which will be on the 22d day of that
month, that we may carefully consider theJ
important matters disclosed ui this
lar. *
... . ? -I *u_
We invite a candid examinauua um
whole scheme, for the protection, not alone of
southern interests, but for the seH^ity: of the
commerce of the whole country. : r:
Let it at least bo tested by patient inresti^
gation, and enlightened research; if by this
plan ono third of the entire cotton crop of the
country can be placed beyond the possibility
of sacrifice, it will give security to tht r&idne'
, not by entrenching it behind' the- speculative
monopoly, but by holding it in that of security
which the just relations of supply anjl demand
, will always in the long run, establish a$d eus.

That no tirtie may be lost, we beg leave to
apprise you that an agent, having our- confidence,
will leave thie shortly for EnropV
clothed with ample instructions to make such
preliminary arrangements with the houses in'
Liverpool and Havre, which may, by the sanction
of t\e convention, have the proposed consignments.

We are aware of the very potent opposition,
which a plan looking even to self-defence,
must invite both at home and abroad, aS it runs
counter, to a variety ofinterests, too powerful,
and too susceptible of combination, not to be
aroueed into active and perhaps inexorable
hostility. If <?ur apology fe not to be found it*
' the pie a, that we fiavo 9 right tor hold our own
property by the means of the credit of our own
country, then we feariessly say, we mean to
attempt it in despite of any opposition however
, eager and implacable.
