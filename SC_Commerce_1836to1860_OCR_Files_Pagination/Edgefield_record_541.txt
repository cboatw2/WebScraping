two repdings in thi House. and was ordtr

will,,undosbtedly, pass the House to-mor

J;Ugries wa4obe laid, to.sujpply the va

Distribution Bill. Amngst these luxuries
are Teaand Cofee,.from which, at least,
half cf the duties will bo raised. The

WASImoT-oY, July 3L.
16athe Senate this morning the bill to
%e the Banss' of thn District of
bia was taken up, the question. be
in a allswing-them to use the paper of
- on specie paying banks, which after a
warm debate was carried, every whig pre.
-sent voting for it. An amendment was
then offered proposing to allow them to is
sue one .ad two dollar notes. This was
u y'posed by the Democratic Sen
atois, whostloded tothe fact that the char
terzoW-hb, ulator" gave it the power
u-inuingae dlar. notes, which would
.bave the effect of driving the gold curren
.cy out of the country ; now an attempt is
- made ito drive the silver out of circulation;
and if the "paper party" remained in
poprer, the next effort would be to drive
'copper coin out of circulation by tho sub
stitution of "sbmn-plasters." Thle amtend
meat was defeated by a majority of one
three Whigs voting against it. The bill
was then ordered to be engrossed for a
third reading. A bill making appropria
tion for the support of the lunatics of the
District was then taken up, and after a de
termined opposition by four or five of the
Democratic Senators, ia was ordered to be
engrossed for a third readitig. Trhe lill
making an approptiation forn aHomne squad
ron was then taken up and after a few
words of explanation, was ordered to be
engrosed and subsequently ii w as read a
third time-and passed, and now wants but
the signature of the President to becotme a
law. A motion wvas then made to adjourti
until Monday next. Mr. Clay of Alabama
objected. Mr. King said if the gentlemnan
oa the opposite side of thse House would
promise not to reproach the lDemocrattc
Senators with delaying the public business:
and if they thought the business could be
delayed without inconvctnience to the suf
fering and agonized people, whose crics
for "action," "action," we~ had heard so
much about, he would iiithtdrawv his oppo
sition. This sally excited tmuch tmerri
*ment, and the pledge being givett, the tro
tion was put and carried amtid roars of
laughter from all sides of the chamber.
In the House, the Tarihi Bill was taken
out of Committee and an almost infinity of
amendments were offered to it, which were
- generally voted down. Thte bill wns then
ordered to be engrossed for a third rea
ding-the yeas and nays not being called
'on the question. The Hlouso then ad
journed.
Wasntto-rox, August 2,
lnathe Senate, this morning, Mr. Cal
houn presented a copy of the proceedings
of a large and repectable mneeting of the
Democratic citizens of Cumberland Coun
ty, Virginia. expressive of their sentiment,
in relation to the important measures now
before Congress. T'he Resolutions arc
well drawn, aid assert that a National
Bank is an institution of deadly hostility,
to thi principles of our Governmetnt, nd
mischievous to thez interests of our country.
That solemnly impressed with the convic
tion of the unconstitutionality and injurious
tendency of a National Bank, should one
be established by the present or any futnrc
- Congress, no matter by what name, or
where located, they hold it to be the right
and bounden duty or any succeeding Con
gross, whenever the people shall have giv

Mr. lienderson denied that this procee
ding.hid referrence to a National Bank.
I Mr. Calhoun said,-it whs. sutlicient for
him and those ^who thought with him,
that the Convention had refused, and that
more than once, to confer on Congress the
power to incorporate, a. it fully justified
theassertion that the bill which was recent-.

Mr. Archer said, as neither himself nor
his colleague had been selected as the or
gans on that floor of the meeting. he regar
ded it as presumptive evidence that it did
not represent the -popular' feiling of the
State. He said the doctrine of repeal was
but another forin of Ntllificntion, and that
Virginia repudiated alike Nullification and
Abolition.
Mr. Calhoun said, if repeal was to be

when that wvas uanauged by two Senators
purposely absening themselves, ho41w was

Prestos! Under such circumstances he
considered the attempt to bind this c-oun

years. as a gross usurpation,-and he never
in his it'o performed an act with more plea
surA thanbe would vote fot the repeal of
thstiill.whenever the Democracy had the
powei of repealing it.
Mr.Bonton said this subject had attrac

gentlemen notice that ie had the proceed

ginia, which .asserted precisely 'the sane
doctrines as te one just presented. lie
would -reserve this-uutil to-nurrow. so that
gentlemen might be prepared with their
vouchers for the constitutionality of a Na

Mr. Lino offered the following resolution,
which lays over until to-morrow.

States be requested to give the notice to the
Bntish Government wilch the convention of

ut so mucht from the part that the inadi

REMARKS OF THE I,0.. F. W. PICK
-ENS, ON TilE REVgNUEfLAW-.
Mr. Pickenssaid this wasa newquestion.
lie had nout thought of it'before the report
was presented-this mornin. Ifit were in
tended to-procure information, by this com
mittee, as to such details ap would enalc
this House to revise the whole system of
tariff duties for protection,then such a com
mittee might lie necemsary to furnish (acts.
But lie thoughat the spirit and meaning of
tihe act cotainntmly called the "compro
mise nct" were plain and simple. Anl if
it were intended that the system should be
readjisted according t6 theipirit imd mean
ing of that act, in good faith, then he ap
prehentded there would' be no very great
difficulty in the matter, as to main point$
The reiernctce made to the practice of the
British Parliament, as to .raising commit
tees, had no analogy to our condition.
Their system of taxes was exceedingly
complicated. They had excises, direct
taxes, and specific duties; and they raised
as much or more from domestic taxes a
they tin from-iumposts. The consequenct
was, that it,was complicated anti required
a thorouga -investigation,' as to facts amid
dietails, before they could:act wisely. on it.
But if we iende to confne ourselves to
the spirit or mhe compromise. paticularly
that part which declared that, after 1842,
the duties shunld be reduced to the econ
onical wants of the (Orvernment-tljat
they shiuld lie for reveotin reality-then
there would be nagreatdifficulty. Ours
would then be merely a low rateof imposts
upon importations. Wetwould have no
excise duties, no direct taxes;- and out
Treasury reports upon expprts and imports,
and the items, together with'the countries
from whence they came, and tihe amount,
would give is all the infaomation necessa
ry for taxes laid strictly 0 revenue alone.
liut if we-were to revive dIll that system of
18241, 1828, & 183, coMplicaed as it was,
& intended to protect she yarious manufac
tures, exclusively, of -the untry, then the
movement in advance , a conmittce
night' be avery neces k step towards
that system. Now, as t .t compromise
act, he ilhought sometb . --M La
quired by Congress. S -.revision and

Now- as tom the effect that this commit

his views f.-,mtm, helhairmnan and fromm the
genitletmanm fruom Matssachusettq, (3r. \Vinm

betaring~ tpon that hill. True it was a hill!
with a very modest title; it was called at

bumt in reailimy it relatetd to a total revisioni

Fads Respecting the Prospects of Hunt
burg.-The suljoined extracts will tiot be
out of place whep we examine into tho
cause relative to the prosperity of lai
burg. The first is part of the Act to es
tablish aid incorporate a Bank it the
Town of Hfamburg, passed in Dec. 1l35,
viz: '
--That in order to establish a Bank in the
Town of Hamburg, the following persons
be and are hereby appoitnted Commissiont
ers to receive subscriptions at the several
places hereafter mentioned. At llambusrrg.
Henry Shultz, W. W. Starke. and Oliver
Simpson."
"Trhat the capital stock of said Bank
shall be divided ito sis thousand shares of
fifty dollarseach shtre. that twelve dollars
and fifty cents in specie shall be paid ott
each share at the time of snbscribing. ald1
that twelve dollais and fifty cents also in
specie, being the isecond instalment, lie paid
on the first Alonday in March next, and
that t-velve dollars and fifty cetts also in
specie, beitig the third instal'neut, be paid
otn tle first londay in Nuvetiber next, and
that twelve dollars and fity cents also in
specie, being the fourth and last inistal
ument, be paid otn the first Monday in De
cember next, and all shares on which the
payment due shall not be punctually made
on 'the days above mentioued, shall be fir
feited with whatever monies may have
been paid thereon."
"And the said corporation are hereby
authorized to increase theireanpital ton sttm
not exceeding five hundrcd thousaud dol
lars."
The following remarks are taken front
the lEdgefieldAdveotiscr, underdate of I Ith
April, 1839; showing the progress of the
Conmiissioners:
I -Bank ofambur~g S. C.-The Books
of Subscription for Stock in this Bank,
were re-opened at lainmburg on MotInday
the I Ith inst.. conformabily to the notice of
tie Commissioners. We were present on
the occasion, and can hear testimttony to the
perfect fidelity with which thieCoumnnissim
ers discharged the important trust onfided
to them. We know must of the men who
have taken stock iu this institutinn. They
are gentlemen of wealth. and of the high
est standing in tle community. They
have taken it under theirspecial guardian
ship, and we know that it must command
the most perfect public confiIuce. We
do not intend a boast, for the Bank does
I not need it; but as an earnest of its future
success, and-as a proof that it was indeed
a money transaction, we will mention, that
after the Books closed, we saw three dray
loads of specie sent over the river by the
Commissioners, to be deposited fur safe
keeping, in one of the Augusta Banks.
Wo congratulate not only the citizens of
Hamburg, but the whole up-country upon
its success thus far. Ahle Officers anti ai
able Direction canl le procured without
difficulty. We have no doubt, that it will
have great influence upon the destiny of
Hamburg. No part of the State enjoys iu
a higher degree the advatitages of location,
and we believe, that it wanted notbing but
Banking facilities to give it the importance.
which it so rcbly merited. Now, it will
meeive a new impetus.- We trust, that in
a little whilr, site may be a rival of her
beautiful sister on the other side of the wa
ter. Heaven forbid. that we should in
dulge otne uittister thought; we hope for an
hotorahle, generous, virtuous rivairy. We
have but to say itn coniclusion, that we sina
cerely wish Hamburg ttay grow and inny
prosper-may continue to grow and prus
per, to gladden the hearts anol to fil. thze
pockets of her most perseverinug Founder,
antd enlterptrisintg ltthabitanats."'

Naw On:taL rs, July 31.
We have no new feature to remark in the

asanates bnagaid in thae ertreme. The weather
during the la.'t moanth haasbhee nest favorablis

without irimediaje revenue. Let as raise
-equally.and gradually proper- revenue du
ties; 20 cent. in dighteen months, upon
your imports, would le more than wo
wanted; it would give $6,0%,000 at least
in the course of two years or less ; twelve
and a half per cent. would be ample fr
all just purposes. This, with the land
revenue, would give certainly $21,000,
000. What more do we want in pence?
It is more by three millions than what is
proper. unless we have war measures, then
it ii not enongh.
It is to be hoped that next session we
will come to a fair and candid investigation
of this whole matter; at present. the Gov
erument has suflicient for all purposes un

But Mr. P. said that the firat five years
of a--tion fronm the compromise act was for
the benefit of the manufacturing interests
-intended for their hcefit. But noy,
when we are about to get the betefit fron

31r. Nisbet said it was a matter of cnri
osity, to say the least of it, that the gentile
man from Virginia, (31r. Wise,) and the
gentleman from South Carolinn, (Mr. Pick.
ens,) should be opposed to inquires, the
object of which was to obtain light and in
formation on a subject which was so deep
lv interesting to them and their constitu
ents. If this was a proposition looking to
a tariff for protection, he was with those
gentlCmcn. But if;he object was, as he
supposed, to obtain light and inteiligence,
he was opposed to the views of those two
gentlenten, and as an anti-tariff man be
was in favor of these inquiries.
Mr. N. contended that the course pur
sued by the British Parliament was a fair
illustration on this subject. The report of
the committee there. he said, had done as
nch towards estahishing the doctrine of
free trade as any thing that had occurred
in recent timer; or at all evets, he trdatcd
it would have that effect.
What was the object of this resolution ?
Was it a tarif for piotection ? As he un
dertood it, it was for information. Gen
tlemen said it was with a view to protec.
tion. Did the inquiry necessarily tend to
that ! Not so. But being, as he was, an
anti-tariff man, opposed to a tariff for pro
teetion, he wanted this light. He did not
profess to be, like the gentleman from
South Carolina,, (Mr. Pickens,) so well
informed as to render further information
unnecessary. As a practical man, be re
peated, he desired light. He believed that
the South had been rather deceived and
micled than enlightened by the reports
mad by distinguished men in the absence
of practical information. He, therefore,
wibe pructical men to speak.
Mr. Pickens explained. He had, he
said, distinctly taken the ground that- if it
was the object of the committee to obtain
information with a view to revise our ta
riil'systetn on the original basis and without
referetnce to the great princeiples ofthe com
protnise act, it might be a matter of vast
itmportance to obtain all the information
within our reach.
Mr. Ni~het proceeded to say that if we
were to tteet the question of a tartff for
protection. it wotuld 1)e better to secure all
the light we could. Theli gentlcman from
Virginia (Mr. WVise) thought that neo
shtouldl have. to meel this quecstin ; atnd he
(Mr. N.) thought thtat we shouldl be com-.
pelled to do so. F'or this reason, hec desi
red that the resolution should hje adoptedt.
Thme daty o.f theory-the (lay of gullibility
on thi5 suibject had beent passedl. Th~e
Southt, it was true, had always utnderstood
hecr rights ini relation to it, but ho was not
so sure thatt she had always piursued themt
otn the proper plani. So far as hisi constitu.
ets w ere concrned, they desired to stand
on rte basis of the contpromise act. I f that
was to lie so, they were contegt. But if
gentlemen itntendedl to revise the etire sys
tett, he for one would opose it to the ex
tent of his htiutble ability. But if the shad
ows of thec times which cast their glocom
before them were to lie relied ott, we were
to moeet these quest ions, andl the hest plan
would be to be prepared for themx. lie
desired, howcver, that they should not lie
lcd away by false theories. The Soutth
would have to give tip sonme of the views it
had heretofore entertaitned, and might
probabily thave to conicede the 20) per cetnt.
adt ralforem duty uunder the comproutise act.
lIeI was prepared to take uip that act andu
revise the duties undecr it with a view to
ain e-quivalenat revetnue and nothingt else ;
atnd if2t per centt. were required, if it were
n.:!cessary to tneet the wants and to sustain
thme htonor of the conuntry and its fidelity to
its engggemnts, he was willing to march
up to that point, lint he was not willitg to
go further. And he would say that he
thaughat it was time that they shoutld be ac
to this subject, lie thought that it
should have gone in advance of the land
and tbc loan bills.
Mr. Pickens wvas understood to inquire of
the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Nis'octt)
whecther twelve-and-a-half per cent. du
ties and duties under that sum would not
be etnough to meet the purpose indicated
by hi j
Mr. Nisbet said he was not prepared to
answer that question. If twelve-and-a
half per cent, would be enough," he would
go for that antount; if twenty per cent.
would be required, he would go for that.
But it was for the very purpose of adjus
ting the rates that it was iudispensabhe that
the facts should be ascertaitned. And this
furnished incomiestablo evidence of the nte
cessity of the adoption of such a resolution.
