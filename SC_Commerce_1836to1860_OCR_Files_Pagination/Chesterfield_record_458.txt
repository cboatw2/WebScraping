Carolina find it an easy task to perform the
high and solemn duty of preventing those
convulsions, by reforming that currency.
Ther&' is another reform in our agricultural
economy, to which every planter
in South Carolina is invited by the most !
persuasive confederations, public and pri- j
vate. It is t<? adopt and steadily pursue ?
a system of permanent improvement, not 1
only in the soil* but in. the buildings and
. . . ' fixtures of bis plantation, and to aoandon
the improvident policy hitherto generally
pursued, of exhausting the soil in the too ,
eager desire to realize a large present incortfe,
without any regard to the figure.?
It is absolutely distressing to contemplate
the memorials of this wretched policy ex- :
? ,v hibited in every part of the State?a
policy which, while it denies to the present
generation almost all the rntioi.a' '
comforts vhich alone make weann uesir- 1
able, leaves to posterity an exhausted sdil,
ruinous mansions, and a barren inheri- '
tance. ,
Now, it would not be too strong an expression
to say that every dollar judicially J
invested in the permanent improvement
- - of hrs estate by a planter, would be worth
more to bis children than two dollars in.
vested, as is usual, in the purchase of 1
inore negroes to cut down the forest and 1
destroy soil. We have reached a point !
in our agriculture, which imperiously de. (
inands a fundamental change in this res. !
poet. However the virgin soils of, the j
South-west may palliate the folly of such 1
a course, the alternative is distinctly pre- 1
sented to us, of permanently improving !
oar estates, or of deserting them. We
?- cannot contend with the planters of Alabaraa
and Mississippi, in a wild and dc.
structive, system, by which even they
have sunk under embarrassment and ruin,
with all their advantages of soil and climate.
We can make up for our inferior J
soil and climate only by a superior system
of husbandry. 'While they are ex- 1
haustin<r their soil and preventing the '
? - ?
natural increase of their slaves by a reckless
system of pushing and driving, let us
improve the fertility of the one, by rest.
ing and manuring it, and increase the
number of the other, by moderate working,
and by providing every thing ncc \s.
/^saryjor their health aud comfort. And
.I have no doubt that a Sjuth^C.irohna
- - ' planter who shall limit his cotton crop to
, five hales to the hand, and rely mainiy
upon the natural increase of his negroes,
will leave a larger estate to his children,
at the end of ten or twenty-yeare, than
a South-Western planter who follows the
- system generally pursued in that quarter,
though he should make eight bales to the
hand, and annually apply his surplus income
to the purchase of land and negroes.
Though they are. really struggling for the
benefit of their children, these is no class
of men who do so little for posterity, and
.will leave so. few monuments behind
them, aa the cotton planters of the South.
What sort of an estimate must be placed
upon wealth, and to what rational end
can he desire it, who, with an income of
ten or twenty thousand dollars a year,
brings up a family ofchildren imperfectly
. educated, in a log cabin, with scarcely
- the comforts of such a dwelling? A
stranger travelling through our country
' ... could not be persuaded that it was inhah. {
ited bv a race of wealthy, hospitable and
" enlightened planters, so few of the monu.
ments and improvements that indicate a ,
wealthy aud provsperous community would ,
meet his eye. And if, by one of those j
^ , great political revolutions which over- i
. whelmed the ancient Greeks and Romans, /
our race of conquerors,and our name only t
descend to posterity, what classic memo. <
rial, what substantial monument, would '
bear testimony that this "delightful re- t
gionofthe sun" had been once inhabi- !
ted by a civilized and enlightened people, 1
eminently distinguished for their industry J
their wealth, and the freedom of their in- (
atitutions? ' ,
In thus urging a more provident regard ,
to the future in our general economy, it <
will hp iw-rrpivpH thai I have still kent in i
view the important object of diminishing j <
the aggregate cotton cropof the country, : I
by giving a more useful direction to a
portion of the capital and labor devoted
too exclusively to its production. It will
be also perceived that I nave* made no
disclosure or recommendation of aOy im^
provernent by which large co'ttbn crops
may be made. I have intentionally abstained
from any suggestion of this kind,
believing that every one rhav be safely
left to his own impulses and his own resources
on this point, and regarding over
production as one of the greatest evils to
which the cotton planting interest is ex' --posed.
Indeed, if I could now reveal u
- process by which our common soils could
. be made to produce two hales of cotton to
" the acre, I should have great doubt wheth"
er the revolution would be a blessing or
a curse to that great interest. I am
** aware that as I have obtained some reputation
.for making large cotton crops, it
may be supposed that I preach one doc- >
trine and prrctice another. But such a
. ? supposition -would do nie injustice.?
- - .1 i . * i j
, wnn me largest couoij crojvi ever mane ,
/ -r-tbat of 1839?I combined all the other k
branches of economy I have here recorn- j
y ' mended. I have now a surplus of 1500 I
bushels of corn made that year, hogs suf- ; i
trcient tosupply'my-'wffnt*, that have been j <
fat enough to slaughter since July* and ' *
ycry lArge stocks of cattle and of sheep, 1
the latter of which supply ail the wool required
forthe winter clothing of iny ne- j1
groesf aad a stock of young-horses and^'
colt*fully adequate to meet the e.xegen- i
cies of my plantation. After making i
due provision for all these objects, it is of j 1
course the true interest of every planter
to make as Urge a cotton crop as he can |(
without ovcr-working his operatives. In | '
doing this, however, he should never lose j1
sight of the great object of improving the f
productive power of his estate, instead of
exhausting it. *
To this end, it should be his constant j
effort, by manuring and resting the,-soil,
and by sqgpnor cultivation, 10 prouuce a r
given result from the smallest possible |
number of acres. It is scarcely possible
to over estimate the value of this rule in j
the actual condition of the old planting f
sta'es. Every resource for making ma. 1
: ure should, therefore, be improvedrto the j
uttermost, without begrudging the ne- *
cessHry la'ior and attention. No labor 8
exerted on the plantation is half so well s
rewarded. Every description of stock 5
should be regularly penned every night J
in yards constantly covered wittr straw, l
leaves.or other litter. The quantity of I
manure that can be thus made in a year J j
is quit#;inconceivable to those who have <
not made the experiment. ?orn should (
he habitually planted in olcl. land, of a j
quality least adapted to cotton, and ev. r
cry hill should he thoroughly manured,! v
scrupulously avoiding the miserable jj
economy too often witnessed, of losing $
one half its utility, to save the inconsider. }
able labor required to apply it properly. I v
can bear.perso lal testimonythatbythe.se
means the crop per acre can he invari. 1
ably doubled on soils originally strong.? ^
My corn is principally produced on level ^
lands that were considered to be exhaus. j t
led when they came into my possession, c
and vet by thorough and careful manur- j
ing, I have reduced the number of acres r
cultivated in com fully one half, making j a
more certain and abundant crops than I . I
did before with double the number of:t
acres and more, than double the labour "of n
cultivation. All the manure not required f3
for the corn crop, should lie applied to :1
the most exhausted of the cotton lands,1 r
and it should he made an invariable rule,; 11

t was the principal element in the origin- , h
ii formation of soils, so it must he in their jr
restoration and ^preservation. Nature i
beneficently provides it to our hands, but j ^
we too often destroy it as if it were a nui- i J.
jatire, w hile we vainly employ our spec,
ilations and direct our researches as? to jj
find out some more scientific means of
improvement. In proportion as the t
quantity of land required for cotton ami a
;orn is diminished by the means proposed, #
will that be increased which is left fallow, y
tnd for small grain. These, after one I
rear's rest in good soils, and always be- c
ore they become covered with broom li
ledge, should be fallowed in the autumn. P
carefully turning in all the stubble and n
veeds, with two horse ploughs adapted to s
he purpose. - u
On the process of cultivation, one or o
1 ? L- u
wo remaras may no* i? uu?p|?i u
nade in this connexion. One of the most .
imminent obstacles both to a system of
?ood cultivation an J to a system of permalent
improvements, is the common prac- g
:ice of over planting. It may be not unrptly
denominated a system of trear and
ear, in regard to land, negroes, horses and
tnd mules. As one of its inevitable conse. c
pjences, a planter almost certainly finds t
liinself, when the seasons are in any de? s
;ree unfavorable, in that uncomfortable t
condition usually expressed by saying" he
s desperately in the grass."- Nomande- r
serves the name of planter who gets into }
his predicament, except in very extraor- c
linarv seasons, any more than he deserves t
the name of general who carelessly per- 1
mits himself to be surprized and surround, a
id by an enemy. For tnough the one t
may work his way out of the grass, as the t
Jther may cut his way out of the toils of t
fiis adversary, vet it is the hard knocks
ind sweat of the laborers in the one case, t
rnd the valor and blood of ?the soldiers in A
the other, that imperfectly atone for the (
ncompetency of the manager and of lbs i
Jdmmantler. It is my confident belfef i
hat when even one half the crop is per- v
nitted'tt) become grassy, the future culti- t
nation of.the whole will require'double the h
abor.that would have been otherwise, ne.* 1
;essary, and with all that, it wiH be impos. (
iible to make a full crop, especially of cot- c
on. In our climate and soil ift the tipper !
iounlrv. the onlv means of avoiding an h
rarnense destruction of immature balls by ij
the autumnal frosts. Is to push the growth i
>f the cotton from the beginning, by thin- a
[ling and preparing it to mature as early as t
t can he safely done, and never permitting e
te growth to be delayed for a. single day 1
iy want of working. For what is lost in
his way can never be recovered; and I jo
lave no hesitation in saying that six.acres o
>f cotton to the hand, properly cultivated, i
vill produce a greater result with one hrif t<
he labor than ten acres to the hahd,tnilti- u
fated in the rough and imperferfect man- r
ler but too common even in this state, 'j
md generally pre> lent in some Others. In q
idopting it as a rule, therefore, to plant no r
arger crop than can be cultivated' in the
nost perfect manner, a planter will besr p
- orrsult every view of sound economy ?
md even the predominant desire to make n
i large cotton crop. t'
In the cultivation of a crop I know no a
ule more important, and which is more c
rally violated, than that ot' doing your
rorlkhoroughly veil, cost u hat labor it may* a
Vloie labor is improiitably waited and 0

rrop,' as it is expressed. The very causes
vbich generally tempt managers to slight

those which most imperiously
lemand the strict observance of the rule
have laid down.
Oneofth Jc resequences of over-cropping I
tnd bad working which ism&t to be de- <
ireented is the necessity th?y create, and <
he apol riy they offer, for permanc ntTv tri- I
uring the s .il by exc sslve p oughing, and 1
vhat is still worse, ploughing in imprope r j
easons. I believe that it may be truly t
aid that in the upper conntry at least, |
louhh* the quantity of ploughing is done i
n cultivating cotton, than can be justified M
>v any sound theory. Everts-ploughing *
vhieh turns rp fresh soil to the burning

ant to remark, tHjtoothing which folly
an infiict on th^Hl, will so certainly I
educe it to, a merWeaput wioftuujft us the ' I
nurderous p actice of ploughing it in wet j

of Ohio. Indiana, and Illinois, during the
year 1841?which, at the suggesiiou of
W. Cost Johnson, of Maryland, was modified
so as to givd 880,000 additional for
that part of the road running between
Fredericktown in Maryland and the seat

On this resolution Mr. Proffit made one
of his most exciting speeches. He tol J
the House plainly that it had better deal

the day was coming, and would soon be
here, when she would help herself? thut
the conduct at present pursued in relation
to expending the revenues of the Government.
would drive the North-West into a

Mr. John Quincy Adarns introduced a

&e oiTmanufactures, of which Mr. Adims
is Chairman. This hill, it will be recollected,
passed the House at the last session,
was1 sent to the Senate, passed,, that
body with amendments, and was returned |
to the House?but owing to the press of|
business, and a rigid adherence to the rules j
of the House as to the order of business, I
which was enforced by its opponents, it
was strangled by the adjournment of Congress.
Part of the amendments of the Senate,
consisted of 9 new Tariff on* great number
of articles or classes of goods, and was
complained of by the anti-tariff men of
' the South, as an infringement of the Com-1
promise Ac. To-day. on Mr. Auam's j
motion, Mr. Pickens led off; Mr. Adams
; answered and a general tariff debate en|
sued, which continued till it was time to
, adjourn when the question was put, and
, thebill, &e? was referred to the Commitee
on Manufactures.
In this debate there were many sharp
and piquant sallies. The disclosures of
1 Sicven&Oxt, in that last card business were
1 referred to. particularly his letter to Mr.
Lee, in which he asks for inoncy from the
merchants, &c., of New-York, with Which
he says he could defeat this bill. Mr. Jftffray
also came in for a handsome modicum
of notice, and his speech about bribing
members of Congress, with dinners
and champagne, was freely referred to.

It is rumored that Mr. Ewing has declined
to receive the office of Post Master
General tendered to him hy Gen. Hakrisox.
I do not learn what his reasons are,
but objections have been made to bringing
so many western men info office. After
another census, however, if not under the
very next apportionment of1 representa.
iives, the western men will probably sweep
all the officers of trust honor, or emolument,
under the federal government.

Every day gives us fresh evidence thathe

to lie over till the next regular session, tin.
less the whigs should deem it expedient
to convene Congress, in May for the purpose
of raising the wind. But this . is 110:
at all probable, though many prominent
whigs here say that they must go to hummering
while the iron is hot.
We have other Cabinet rumors, as to the ,
minor officers, Mr. George Evans, of
Maine, is talked of for the Navy Departnient.
A betterofficcr could not he found,
but I had supposed that the whigs .would
reserve hiin for Speaker, in case Mr. Bell
should, as is probable, take the War Department.
' '
Nothing else remains unsettled hut the
Post office. Inasmuch as Mr. Ewing, of
Ohio, declines that department, there is
yet to be a scramble for it. M:. Stevbns.
of Pe.'tn., has been, and will be, urged for
it.
In the Sena?? Mr. Benton a-ked leaveto

The debate was opened by Mr. Rf.ylold3.
who gave us quite an interesting speech ?
in relation to the sufferings of the new ,
States, and the injustice which had been
practised upon thcin by their brethren,
and by the general government. He coneluded
by stating that unless something
was done for their benefit, they might be
prompted to nullify, and tax all lands belonging
to the general govcrnmehf within
their respective limits. *
Mr. Picnens. of South 'Carolina, followed
Mr. Reynolds, and regretted that
the subject had been brought forward during
this short session, as he had entertain.'
ed the hope that the matter would be left
for final settlement to (he next Congress.
He confessed that the prospect of having
justice done to the old States was very
doubtful, if the returns of the late census
were to be relied on ; but whatever course
was pursued he hoped would he a permanent
one. Mr. P. denouueed in strong
terms the p!ans heretofore pjrsucd, of altering
every two or three years the manner
of disposing of the public lands, and said
thai if the thrcais which were held out hv

Mr. Johnson, of Maryland then made
n very handsome speech in favor; of the
old S a teg, and took ground at length A-.
gainst the propositions laid dewn Uv the
western. gentleman, He wished justice
done to all, but the west setnud to think
that taking every"thing was only doing her
justice, while tiipse to ivhom^thc property

possessions. He scouted, the idea that
the people of the west were suffering.
I Mr. Clay has not yet returned from
New. York. It is understood, that the re.
peal of the Sub-Treasury w ill be the first
| step in the order of the new system of the
Hurrison party,and that Mr. Clay, who
I has aheadv brought it forward in the
Senate, will be ready to push it. as soon
j as the general resumpt ion of specie pay- J
I meats by the Bauks shall have taken place.
Ttiut resumption w ill prevent any difficult

tnc government will Then be paid in the
notes of specie paying banks, and, in all
cases where it inuy he convenient, such
banks will be employed as the depositories
and fiscal agents of the government.
The quest ^>n of a National Bank will
next follow, and is of doubtful issue.
The Land Question is to tie discussed
i i the House to-morrow, and for some days
to come, unless the previous question
should be resorted to for the purpose of
cutting off the debate. There is great
earnestness on the part of the South-western
and Western members to discuss the
whole subject of the policy of the government,
in regard to the public lands: It is
to be a troublesome question for the next
administration.
:: Dec. 28.
There was some agitation in the Senate
to-day, produced by Mr. Benton's motion
to print his project to tux the S'nte Banks.
It must be remembered that Mr. Benton's
'4 last card,v the proposition to tax the
Banks, was rulled out, because it was a
I palpable infraction of the Constitution according
to which revenue bills cannot originate
in the Senate. Some hqve expressed
surprise that Mr. Buxton should be
so very oblivious to the Constitution, as to
offer such a project! How much greater
then was this surprise, when Mr. Brxton
moved that the obnoxious proposition be
printed. lie had witndraw 1 it, not by
right, but by couriesy.' Tnon moving it
again, it was almost universally repelled
a..d thrown out.
