yet the honorable senator ns confidently affirms that, if (

I welt stated and appunwUly well considered arjjtiineti, ol
the honorabte senator has iuduced mo to think this hydrostatic
phcuotiieuon may not have been a more traveller's
story. It cerrtiuly goes fartlier to prove tluit free trade
is a systom of mutual destruction, than nuytliiug I have
ever lieard, except a memorable battle between two celebrated
cats which I have rend in a very authentic work ??n
Irish chivalry, from which I have extracted a brief and
graphic account of this extraordinary and eventful combat
lor the information of the Senate.
"In die vear 1633," says this work, "there was in the
town of Kilkenny two extraordinary cats, remarkable for
their power of destruction. Each of them had gone through
a career of victorious contests, and had never failed to destroy
and devour his adversary. lJnt it hiul so hnp|>ened
thut they had never been brought into contact. Prompted
by that benevolent spirit of partisanship which never
fails to bring two neighboring bullies together, the good
people of Kilkenny published and proclaimed that on a
| certain duy a pitched battle would take place between
thesa two illustrious champions. On the appointed day,
the Irish people assembled lroui great distances to witness
the contest, as the people of ancient fSreece assembled to
I witness the (llvtniiio wi -* r - *
- 8u.?vr. .?ii.-n ui?-mmi nnur arrived, (

not a ventimi behind. And while the sj>octHtnrs stood mute
with astDuishniont, an Irishman from Cork leaped over the
list*, and exclaimed with iui air of triumph, "there now,
did you not see how that ?as done 1 Puitdy O'llaflerty is
no tnie son of Arin if Uiey did not ate each other nj?."
Mr. President, I beg Senators to consider that this is no I
hutching matter. It ]atinta a high moral mid an awful |
warning to the world. It fully confirms the argument of
the honorable senator froiu Massachusetts; und if all the
tuitions of the earth should rashly establish a mutual free '
trade, who knows at what moment thoy might experience I
the dismal fate of the two Kilkenny eats. I
On the-dist, Mr. McDutlie continued his remarks, as
follows: , !
Mr. President! lit the rctmuk* I had the honor to sub- 1
tnit yestefilay, I attempted to show that the historical re- |
view of the protective system, to which our attention was '
invoked by the senators from Massachusetts, as well us |
the philosophical auulysis of prices abroad und at home,
demonstrate conclusively, that our manufacturers are fur- 1
ther behind their foreign competitors, at this moment, and
loss capable of iii'iiutaiuiiig a competition with tliein than (
at any former period. And especially that since 18IK, the j
price of domestic uiuuufucliirea has been steadily rising, as
ci inpared with the price of rival foreign lit umfactures.? J
'I bis I proved by the steady and progressive increase of (
the protective duties, at short intervals, undor the solemn 1
mum.f..JU ojigry.nistnma. fhqX
; Uncrossed duties wore necessary to two ihciu IVOlu rrtrn .
In resinning the disenssion, I projHtse to notice very briefly
some of the arguments of other senators. But first, the I
senator from Virginia, (Mr. ttives,) who principally con- \
fined his argument to the constitutional power ot Congress j
to impose protective duties. Ho contends that the power .
"to regulate commerce with foreign nations," involves
the right to protect domestic wanu/aetures by restinc* t
lions upon tluit commerce. If the honorable senator J
had looked into the popular discussions which nave rise in
the convention at Annapolis, lie would liuve twcu thut the
great object of calliug thut convention wiw to regulutu *
commerce; not with a view to promote domestic intuiii- t
factures at the expense of that commerce, but to promote, (
encourage anil defend it, by measures calculated to defend
it, by measures calculated to promote that object. The .
power to regulate commerce, upon any rational principle 1
1 of interpretation, is a power to protect commerce, as much t
eons if the word "jirdlk't" had been used instead of the s
%v??rd "regulate." I challenge the senator from Virginia to j
1 produce tui instance in the debates of tho convention, of u
member of Unit body avowing that the protection of do- 8
mestic manufactures was one of the objects for which the >
power to regulate commerce was conferred upon Congress. <
Kvery senator well knows that tho main purpose of confer- ,
ring this power to regulate commerce was to haruiouize
conflicting regulations of the States, which could only be '
lone by a common authority. It was to give uniformity to I
our system of commercial regulations. Indeed, Mr. Pre.-;:'- i
smi, ir more was any one e^errt wiunaM mu-rcsr ivnich it ,
wits die leading obje t of the framers of tho constitution to .
encourage and extend, it was foreign commerce. The '
tftatcs wore amply competent to foster and protect all oth- I
er great Interests. What, then, can he more perfectly .
monstrous and unnatural than for Congress, tho special and '
exclusive guardian appointed by the constitution to preserve
and nourish foreign commerce, to oiler itusasucri- '
lire to another interest not committed to its charge .' i
JJut the Senator from Virginia has attempted to i
sustain his argument by the authority of great i
names, and among others that of Mr. Jefferson.? <
i4 tj T *
is iruc, i*ir. oenerson at one time believed in t
tlje efficacy of commercial restrictions, as a means j
of vindicating our commercial rights against the i
injustice and violence of foreign powers. But
this system of hostile restrictions, like the embar- i
go, was a substitute for war. It was recommend- i
fd and adopted as a war measure. Experience I
proved its total ineflicacy, and it has been aban- i
doncd by the whole country. It has no hearing
at nil on the question of protecting domestic inn- j
nufactures. During, or soon after, the late war, i
JVIr. Tefferson n_nd.ii. ...... ...._ <
factures flourish?a wish in which every patriot .
I must concur. But he said not a word about ex- i
lorting contributions from all other classes to in- <
crease the profits of the manufacturers. But in l
1825, ill a letter to Mr. Giles, he did speak unc- j
qutvocally on that point; arid I shall quote a sin- I
gle sentence, which is a conclusive answer to the I
argument of the Senator from Virginia : i
"Under the power to regulate commerce, they i
assume indefinitely that also over agriculture and
manufactures : and call it reputation ti> take ike <
earning of one of these branches of industry, and I
that, t(*j, the most depressed, and put them into
the pockets of the other, the most flourishing of
all.
This emphatic denunciation had direct reference
to the tarilf of 1S2J, then recently passed. With
what accumulated force does it apply to the tarilf
of 18|2, which adds from 60 to 100 per cent, to
that of 1S21 ? In a letter to Mr. Madison in 1S2G,
he speaks pf "the general prostration of farming
business, under lovicy for the support of rnunufacfures,"
as eonniOufing to fits own pecuniary emliarrassmcnt
and ruin. Now, I take it for granted
that the Senator from Virginia will never again
nppeal to the authority of this great and illustrious
statesman, to sustain the "new views" which seem
to have boon recently revealed to him on this subject,
so directly opposed to the uniform course of
Virginia for twenty years, and to his own course
since I first had the pleasure to unitu my efforts
with his, in opposition to the tariff of 182-1.
JBut the clause of the constitution under which
tQB power to impose protective duties is most generally
claimed, m that which authorise* Congress

distinctly expressed, tuay bm legitimately exercised
for another, and even inconsistent purpose,
is doctrine too absurd.. to be openly tvowe^
however it may Inrprootlsbd. This power of protecting
domestjp nsanulectures by. higjt duties
therefore, is brought 'now iuto operation unaer
the plausible and iosidiotu guise oi a revenue tariff.

of tactics, "which grew out of the Union "between
southern and northern whigs?'when I
heard Southern nullifiers declaring that the manufacturers
wanted no protection beyond that which
a revenue tariff woultfafford ; and above all, wheri
I saw that the protective tartff 1842, the foulest
of all the brood, was entitled "An act for providing
revenue," I became at once impressed with
the magnitude of the danger to which the whole
agricultural, and particularly the exporting interest
of the country was imminently exposed. The
people of the United States may be swindled out
of their rights by artful devices and false tokens;
but they will never submit to oj?eh and undisguised
oppression and injustice. J'hoy may be betrayed
by a false Hug hoisted by an artful enenrp ,
but never conquered in a fair fight in the open
field. I confess, Mr. President, I was great1
alarmed when 1 saw the manufacturers violatii g
the compact of 1833, by which they stipulated to
be satisfied with a fixed but liberal contributi ?
Irom atr other cratsCS; ahcTlnen aatimg fraud a
deception to bad faith, by recommending tneir piracies
under the Hag of a constitutional rev^n e
tariff. With this view of the subjecju I opened
the debate on this measure by drawing tne distinctive
line which separates a revenue from a piotective
duty; and I now re-affirm what 1 then
staled, and which has not been answered, that tb
revenue standard is the lowest rate of duty that
will raise the requisite amount of revenue. I
also affirmed, and it has not been denied, that n
average duty of 20 per cent, upon all foreign i
posts would yield not only a sufficient revenue,
but a larger amount than the present tariff; and
how is this answered ? Why, the Senator from
31aine says, any tariff that, upon the whole will
yield sufficient revenue, is a revenue tariff. If
this he not a blight idea, it is certainly a new one.
If we suppose a tariff which prohibits, by some
one-half, the imports we now receive from foreign
countries, and lays duties upon the other half sufficient
for the purposes of revenue, this, according
to the Senator's definition, would be a revenue
tariff! You positively prohibit and exclude onelialf
the imports in this case to "raise revenue ! !"
Absurd as this would be, it differs not ver^' widely
from 'be tariff of IS 12; for I shall hereafter show
that it is a more prohibitive and oppressive tariff
than any we have ever had?not excepting that of
1S2S. Now, if the supporters of this measure
think they can make oppression a sweet morsel,
instead of a bitter pill, by changing its name?if
they suppose they can alter the flavor of a fish geranium
by calling it a rose, or asafictida by calling
it frankincense, they will hardly succeed with a
people who "snuff tyranny in the tainted gale."
i'liey have certainly reversed the policy pursued
by Great Britain towards the colonies during the
revolution. If Mr. Burke be good authority, the

:he preamble, bv way of asserting the power of
Parliament, and the dignity of the crown. Now,
)ur republican Congress liave certainly made a
vast improvement upon the British Parliament in
axation. Thcv veJy prudently'gave up the titl?,
jut not only retain the obnoxious taxes, but greaty
increase them ! It remains to be seen whether
lie people of the United States are 0? much beow
their forefathers in tho spirit of liberty, as a
-epublican Congress is above a British Parliament
11 the art of oppression.
In the course of the remarks I first offered to
he Senate in favor of this bill, I admitted that
:ertain discriminations might be made in the rates
if duty upon strict revenue principles. For eximplc
: 1 said a lower rate of duty ought to be
mposed upon course manufactures consumed by
he poorer classes, than upon foreign fabrics conuimed
by the wealthier classes ; and the honora>le
Senator from Georgia, who I am sorry not to
;ee in his place, with ull. the zeal of a new concert,
seizes upon the admission as a full concession
of the protective power to Congress. For,
says the senator, this is substantially protecting
lie poor by a sort of public churity. I confess,
sir, I was not prepured to hear this argument from
my m.wa. low ftunr tW snrau>r ftuni
rleorgia. I have always supposed that it was a
irst principle i.i every system of equitahlo taxation,
to distribute the burdens imposed upon the
people as nearly as possible in proportion to theit
ibility to pay, or to the property they hold under
the protection of the government. In this view,
, l... ;.,o. 0...1 :...i.i.. ? ? -t.
t. it vuiu uu juji cxuu utjuiluuiu ou iu ai lau^u uiu
taxes that they should lull, if it were practicable,
upon the holders of property exclusively, entirely
exempting those who have no property and live
an the wages of their daily labor. Upon this
principle, the members of the first Congress avowed
and acted upon the principles of laying the
heaviest duties 011 luxuries. And in laying internal
duties, the same principle lias always prevailed.
For example ; pleasure carriages are highly
taxed, while road and farm wagons are entirely
exempted. And all these discriminations are
made with strict regard to the true principles of
revenue and taxation. Now, sir, after this brief
exposition, 1 leave the honorable Senator from
Drnsuto ... .anI#A ?1. -i* I.U <* - -> *1 w
\nd if, as lie seems to suppose, he has discovered
1 marc's nest, 1 think that he will find, iStpon reexamination,
that it is entirely empty. And laugh
hough lie may?and I should be the last to deprive
him of that innocent and harmless gratification?he
certainly will not laugh at the eggs. That
Honorable senator very earnestly deprecated the
litempt to disturb the slumbers or mar the symmetry
of the tariff of 1842, because he said it
would derange the whole revenue system of the
country ! Now, sir, ns the Senate must recollect
the distinguished part acted by the honorable Senator
in accordance with the unanimous opinion of
Georgia and the whole South and South-west,
against the tariff of 1832, I propose to exhibit a
brief comparison of that with the present tariff,
for the information of the whole country. I confess,
Mr. J'resideut, that when I was induced by
the unexpected course of the senator from Georgia
to make this comparative analysis, 1 was utterly
os'.onished at the result. 1 ain sure tho
country will bq astonished when I state
1 have, then, u statement in my hand, embracing
seventy-five articles and classes of articles,
showing an average increase of duties by the act
of 1842, beyond those of 1832, almost sufficient, of
itself, to make a revenue tariff sufficient for the
wants of an economical government. I offer u
few specifications by way of illustration. Hy the
act of 1H32, the duty on plain kerseys and keudul
cottons, used for negro clothing, was 6 per cent,,
hy the net of 1842, it was raised to 40 per cent,
On negro blankets the duty was raised from fi tc
15 percent.; on worsted stuff goods, constituting
a large proportion of our imports of wollen manufactures,
the duty was raised from 10 to 30 jhm

when addressing an audience, of some two

ipeakcr, we attempted to conceal our emotion by
klacing our hat over our face, but happening to
ook around, to our astonishment and relief, beleld
the eyes of most of the assemblage suffused
vith tears. Whilst speaking of the oppression of
he Tariff, as he pronounced the expression "I
tad rather he a dog and buy the moon, yea, I
tad ruther be a cat, and cry mew," than to suffer
iucIi oppression, a flash of indignation beamed
from the eyes of the assembled multitude as expressive
almost as that from the lips of the speaker
limself.
A TURNING OF THE TABLES.
The taciturn modesty of some of our citizens in
regard to the subject of Annexation is beginning to
iwd a prompter in the growing sentiment of Tcxnr
ty a nave^Vevn nxmin? lur tnor "mveiiiiUTT'or
? _ - 0 ' ?tome
popular alternative which would secure to
:hat Republic the supposed advantages of annexition,
and at.the same time save them the humility
of u national identity with some one of the European
powers. The incipient feutures of such a
scheme arc at this time to be seen working on the
public mind of that country, and as we conceive
them to contain the consistent elements of a true
national policy, we feel satisfied the day is not distant
when, with a universal voice, the peoplo of
that country will respond to the measure.
It is well known that the manufacturing interests
of Texas arc never likely to become so important
as to call for legislative attention, and
the supply of all manufactured articles for home
consumption, must be brought either from the
United States or some other manufacturing country
; consequently, there is no motive urged for a
prr>i#.f?tivis tariff", as is urced in the ?*f tl??
United States. The true policy then, which
should actuate Texas, and which is already be
ginning to engross their attention, is, to admit,
free of duly, the manufactured articles of those
governments only which will afford them the
cheapest, and where, also, they can secure in return
the privilege of sending out, free if duty,
the surplus productions of their own soil, and
thus establish on the most advantageous terms a
reciprocal free trade.
Such a stipulation between this government and
Texas, would be of no utility to the latter, because
we not only have nearly all the varieties of
Tcxian staple to dispose of ourselves, but it is a
well ascertained that we cannot supply them
with manufactured goods any tiling like as cheap
as they can procure them elsewhere. It is not
. ,*- i ^ ?* ? -V* ** i j
should be preferrod as possessing all these advantages.
. *
Let Texas, by a. judicious governmental policy,
open a free trade with those two nations^ and she
ut once secures a great commercial precedence
over the United States, with her existing Tariffhaving
a more active and lucrative market, and
obtaining her foreign supplies at lower rates. Nor
is this the only ostensible advantage which Texas
would secure by such a measure. They wish to
increase their population, and there is scarcely a
greater attraction to men emigrating to a new
country in quest of fortune than the certainty of a
good market for their productions, and cheap
goods for their families. Another probable advantage
is, that the inducements held out to those
countries ubrnad in favor of an active trade, will
the more certainly sccuro their eo-nperation in tho
adjustment of her difficulties. It is undoubtedly
very much in the power of England and France
to negotiate between Mexico and Texas, and in
the prospect of such an enlargement of commercial
operations, it docs rot Seem probable that apy effort
would be wanting to mediate in favor of an
acknowledgment of Texian independence on the
part of Mexico: and with such an acknowledgment,
Texas would of course no longer seek or
need further identity with another power; and
conscqiiencfl, our hopes of a future annexation
bo lost.
Wo are-far from a willingness * to ad tnit
scheme to altogether visionary: and the Taga<.
papera are giving currency to the doctrine. Much
would undoubtedly depend, upon the. influence of
Gktoat Britain and-France in securing from Mexico
the reltaqutabment of her preecnt hoatilitiea toyarda
Tex^s, and the prospective recognition of
her national independence. If a probability of I

A DISTRESSING AFFAIR. "
The Baltimore Clipjier notices the death oi a
beautiful young lady, in the western part of that j
temj>orary excitrnent. The Clipper says :?^"It
appears that the two youn" ladies boarded with
their brother-in-law, in \V est Lexington street,
where they followed the business of seamstresses;
were industrious and virtuous, and highly respectable.
A young man-had lor some time been paying
attention to die eldest of the two, and was, we
understand, engaged to be married to her in two
mouths' time. This was opposed not only by the
younger sister, but also by hor brother-in-law and
family, but apparently without effect; and one
evening, about two weeks since, he called at the
house and wuited on her to church. On their return
the family had retired, but after knocking at
die door awhile, it wus opened by her brotlior-inlaw,
who, as the young man was ubout to step in,
seized him by the collar, when, of course, a fracas
ensued, which ended in some unpleasant words
between the young lady and her sister and brother-in-law,
the former immediately leavinc ?he
house, and going to the next neighbor-, .em i.ned
all night. The next morning she proceeded in the

This was denied her?she assorted that inasmuch
as she had paid for a portion of it, she was entitled
to it and should take it, and was in the act of gathcring
it out of a barrel in which it had l>ecn stowed,
when, unfortunately, the younger sister, in the
excitement of the moment, seized a shovel, and
raising it, gave her two heavy blows on the head,
stunning her severely, and producing a slight
bleeding at the nose. The lady residing next door,
with whom she remained the previous night, hearing
her scream on receiving the first blow, ran to
her relief, and immediately took her into hegiiouse
in a swooning condition. Medical advice was obtained
in the cvhning, when it was found that her
