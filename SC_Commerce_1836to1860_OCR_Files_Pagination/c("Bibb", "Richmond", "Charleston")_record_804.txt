Madison, distant about thirty-five mile*. It wu
important. for us, as we wished to take the mail
boat that evening, to reach Madison as early as
' might be. We accordingly used every reasonable
■ method of quickening locomotive action, by con
vincing our conductor of the very important inter
ests which depended on our being in time for the
mail boat that very evening. Of course, he was
convinced,—fully convinced; how could he be oth-.
erwisel But still we stopped very often, and fre
quently for very insufficient reasons. At least, so
thought my friend W., who had left a sick wife at
home, and who had set his heart very decidedly up.
on seeing her the. next morning. However,, our
anxieties produced no sort of effect upon the loco
''motive; it held on its way at its own gait, and roll
ed us into Madison a little after four. Time enough
' 'thought I: but another look satisfied us that our
journey was ended for that day; for behold, there
was the mail boat just raising steam, and puffing
and. blowing on her way for Cincinnati. We were
• too late; five minutes sooner and all would have
been right. But alas, regrets were useless ; time
' could not be recalled ; and ob, how often in mat
ters of far higher importance, is the loss of a few
moments fatal to our dearest, our best, our eternal
hopes. Oh time ! precious time ! we take no note
. of thy value, till thy moments are fled, and we stand
gazing on the receding object of our hopes, and can
only exclaim, oh for ten, or even five minutes more!
’ It was now Saturday evening, and as we could
not help ourselves, we concluded that resignation
was a most important grace, and resolved to content
ourselves in Madison, and preach for the good peo
ple on the next day. Accordingly, Dr. E. and my
self, took up our lodgings in the family of brother
, Taylor, a pleasant, kind family, and very good quar
ters for Methodist preachers. In the morning, I
preached to a large congregation on justification by
faith- We had a solemn and interesting meeting.
My own soul was graciously visited, while I was
endeavouring to point roy hearers to the great ato
ning sacrifice of Calvary; and many 01 tne jarge
congregation that waited upon God in that holy
place on that blessed Sabbath morning, realized in
their own souls the power and sweetness of faith in
a crucified, risen, Jesus. At night, I heard a strong,
suitable sermon from Dr. Elliott; and on Monday
evening, we embarked in the steamer Ben Franklin
No. 6, for Cincinnati, which we reached next morn
ing about daylight or a little before. I was con
ducted by Dr. E., to the house of W. K. Niff, in
whose very hospitable and pleasant family, I re
mained during my sojourn in the queen city.
On Wednesday, November 1st, there was held
a semi-annual meeting of the American Bible So
ciety. The meeting convened in the Wesley
chapel. The day was rainy and excessively un
pleasant, yet there was a respectable assemblage,
who listened with a good deal of apparent interest
for two hours or more to a very clear and cogent
address from the Rev. Dr. Spring, of New-York.
on the Bible as the only rule of faith. The con
vention remained in session some day or two lon
ger : but I know but little of their doings. Of the
queen city, as her sons proudly call her, I need say
nothing, except that she is fully entitled to the
proud appellation. With an immense manufactur
ing capital employed, surrounded by a country of
immense fertility, filled with an industrious and en
terprising population, numbering already some six
ty thousand, with a rapid annual increase, she al
ready stands pre-eminent, and is destined to a still
higher distinction.
The society too, in Cincinnati is good, embracing
as it does, a vast amount of intelligence directed by
a controlling, moral and religious influence. It is
regarded too, as being healthy, and all these ad
vantages combined, make it a place of resort and
of summer*residence for many of the wealthy resi
dents of the lower Mississippi. Our beloved Me
thodism exerts here a large share of influence, and
in our Western book agency located here, the
church has a most powerful auxiliary for spreading
scriptural holiness over these lands.

MARION CIRCUIT, SOUTH CAROLINA.
Brother Wighlman,—Perhaps I ought to say
something concerning the religious state of the
circuit, inasmuch as the year is drawing to a close ;
and this I would gladly do, if I had any thing plea
sant to communicate. But our attention has been
turned chiefly to the most unpleasant part of a
minister’s duty. . We found some chaff among the
wheat, notwithstanding the vigilance of some of
our predecessors. We set ourselves to wiimow
out the chaff, that the wheat might be preserved.
We have succeeced so far as to get rid of several
useless members, and yet I fear the work is not
finished.
Our only camp-meeting Degaii on urn uu. uu
Friday evening the great Shepherd and Bishop of
souls, gave us an omen of good by bringing one
penitent out of darkness into his marvellous light.
Our brethren preached faithfully “the word of life,"’
and on^aturday several found it “quick and pow
erful and sharper than a two-edged sword,” and ere
the close of that day’s service, they too were
brought into the liberty of the children of God.
But on Sunday evening, alter the supper of the
Lord, and under an appropriate exhortation closing
that solemn service, a great work began and pre
vailed through the whole congregation, and we sup
pose at least twenty whites professed to find the
pearl of great price, making in all during the meet
ing perhaps thirty whites, besides the coloured, the
number of which it was impossible to ascertain.
We have admitted into the church on trial during
the year upwards of sixty, of whom the greater
portion are whites. Your brother and friend,

ANOTHER CONFERENCE SCHOOL.
Mr. Editor,—You are aware that it has been in
contemplation for some years to establish a Confer
ence Institution in the eastern part of the State,
affording the facilities of a classical education to
those who are too remote from 'the Cokesbury
School. I have thought it might be advisable to
present the subject in this prominent form, to those
who are mostly interested in the contemplated pro
ject. There is, at present, what I conceive to be a
providential opening, affording ample opportunity
for the establishment of a Conference School, on a
substantial and economical basis, at the village of
Marion. It is not proposed at present to originate
one exactly upon the plan of the Cokesbury School,
but simply to afford to the Academy the adoption,
patronage, and influence of the Conference, with
out involving the Conference in any responsibility
in the erection of a boarding house ; there being
one gentleman of known character willing to make
every necessary preparation for the accommodation
of students, at a rate established by the Board of {
Trustees. I
, I think that this is the plait meat commonly
adopted at the North, and it ia unquestionably the
moat prudent, aaitia certain to exempt the Con-;
ference from all embarrassment and liability. The
Trustees of the present Academy, though not yet
officially, have manifested almost an unanimous
wish to confer upon the Conference the title to the
buildings, provided that upon the withdrawal of
Conference patronage, the buildings return to the
original board. A little addition will make this
building answer all practical purposes, requiring
but a trifling expenditure. Again, there is at.the
place one who, in every moral and intellectual re*
spect is recommended as competent to assume the
government of the Institution, and all that will be
necessary is to appoint an assistant teacher,—two
teachers I presume, being amply sufficient for
seventy-five students.
As to the locality, Marion Court-House is well
known for its unprecedented and uninterrupted
health. Its situation is central to the whole Pee
Dee country, and would-'be convenient to our,Con
ference District east of Wateree and Santee. It
will be essential to the prosperity of the School
to endow it with a small apparatus, sufficient for
illustrating the principles of experimental philos
ophy ; and I would suggest that, as it is contempla
ted to aflbrd gratuitous tuition to the children of our
travelling preachers, a call for their liberality would,
doubtless, meet a hearty .response. I have drawn up
these thoughts hastily, in order to present the sub
ject to the attention of the preachers, before whom
it is proposed to'bring it, in all its bearings, at our |
next Annual Conference. Marion, i

THE SAILORS AT THE LOVE FEAST.
A Methodist Love-feast, properly conducted and
improved, is a place on the confines of heaven. It
is a banquet of spiritual enjoyments not too glow
ingly described in the language of the ^prophet—“ a
feast of fat things,a feast of wines on the lees; of
fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well
refined.” Such emphatically was the one held at
Cumberland Church in this city, on the evening of
the 30th ult. During the day application for tickets
of admission was made to our excellent pastor, from
eleven ship-masters, all of them religious men, hap
pening to be in port at the time. After the usual
introductory exercises were over, and one and
another had spoken of the goodness of God in the
leading points of their past and present experience,
our sea-faring brethren got fairly under way,
and in thoughts that breathed and words that
burned, bore a testimony to the truth, power, and
excellency of religion that carried our hearts by
storm. In the remarks made by each of the cap
tains, there was exhibited a clear understanding of
the way of salvation by faith in a crucified Saviour;
a hearty reliance on the merits of the great atone
ment ; a vigorous apprehension of the mighty sim
plicities and spiritualities of gospel religion ; and a
keen, matter-of-fact, unmystified enjoyment of the
“ comfort of the Holy Ghost.” They had much to
tell too, of God’s preserving care amidst the dang
ers of the sea; of perils encountered and deliver
ances realized; of stormy winds, and dark skies,
and thundering gales, and long separations from
home, and voyages to distant shores; and how reli
gion was a thing for all sorts of weather, and all
sorts of scenes, and all varieties of latitude;—mak
ing a man happy amidst earth’s extremest vicissi
tudes, and holy amidst its deadliest snares. The
coldest heart among us, caught inspiration as these
men went on ; lips usually locked fast at our com
mon love-feasts, were opened quickly enough to
praise God for his “ wonderful works amongst the
children of menall felt that the heaven of love
had come perceptibly nigher; and such a joyful,
subduing sense of the divine presence has rarely
if ever been known at a Charleston love-feast.
Twenty years ago, the writer of this brief sketch,
was called on to take part in efiorts then commenc
ed for the improvement ot the condition of seamen.
That love feast was morgthan remuneration for all
the cost of twenty yearsv anxieties and exertions
for this worthy object. What noble missionaries
thought I, would these good captains make ! Mis
sionaries in some important sense they already are.
May their example fly like pentecostal winds, till
the “ abundance of the sea shall be converted un
to God,” and their ships be messengers of glad
tidings, speeding over the mountain waves and the
mighty deep, carrying in the persons of their offi
cers and seamen “ preachers of righteousness” to
the distant shores visited by them,
“ Till every land and nation
Has learned Messiah’s name.”

GENERAL INTELLIGENCE.
FOREIGN.
The Monster Telescope.—The Rev. Dr. Rob
inson, the celebrated astronomer of Armagh, in a
letter, describing the gigantic telescope now con
structing by the Earl of Rosse, as nearly complete,
says:—“The speculum, which weighs three tons,
has been ground to figure, and can be polished in a
day. The tube, partly a cylinder of inch deal,
strongly hooped, and eight feet diameter at its centre,
is complete. The massive centres on which the
telescope is to turn are in their place, and the appar
atus which supports the speculum, which is of wire,
and of great Weight, is also complete. The teles
cope is not to be turned to any part of the sky, but lim
ited to a range of half an hour on each side of the
meridian, through which its motion will be given by
powerful clock-work, independent of the observer.
For this purpose it stands between two pieces of
masonry of Gothic architecture, which harmonises
well with the castle. One of these pillars will sus
tain the galleries for the observer, and the other the
clock-work aad other machinery, one of which is
finished and the other being nearly completed. An
extremely elegant arrangement of counterpoises is
intended to balance the enormous mass, so that a
comparatively slight force only will be required to
elevate or depress it, much of which is also com
pleted, and Lord Rosse considers that a couple of
months will be sufficient to have the instrument fit
for trial. The arrangements will not permit the ex
amination of an object at any time, but only when
near the meridian, when objects are best seen. So
large a telescope will always require the most fa
vourable circumstances of air, &c., and there will
always be enough of objects at any given time to
employ it fully. The aperture is six feet, and the
focal length fifty-two feet.'’
*
Prostects for the W inter—The favourable
news from China has already given a further im
petus to trade in the manufacturing districts, which,
with increased activity in other departments of
commerce likely to result therefrom, affords rea
sonable grounds for calculating that the winter
months,-—during which there is usually so great a
want of employment,—will this year pass over
without that dullness ar.d distress which are fre
quently attendant upon that season. At present
most branches of our national industry are in a
state of full employment; there is no lack of work,
and wages have slightly advanced; the consump
tion of bread stuffs has considerably increased, and
there can be no doubt that this position of affbirs
must rtttn haVte an taffuencte tti tlfe trtifo In ttfrrr.
That the value of wheat cannot eaeily fall below ita
present level is in our opinion almost certain, the
reports a deficiency in the yield being now so
general as to leave no doubt of their accuracy.—
The principal cause of the late decline has been the
liberal manner in which farmers have been obliged
to supply the markets to raise the money required
for the payment of their Michaelmas rents. This
difficulty having now been got over, and the rain
which has fallen during the week having rendered
the soil sufficiently moist to commence autumn til
lage, a considerable falling off in the deliveries from
the growers may be calculated on. Neither mil
lers nor bakers hold large stocks of flour, and an
increased consumption could not long be met with-'
out causing the price to rally.—Shipping and Mer
cantile Gazelle. 1
- Madagascar.—The following communications
from our indefatigable missionary, the Rev. D.
Johns, under date Mauritius, April 12, will be read
with deep and painful enterest. “The directors
had been encouraged to hope that a mission might
be commenced in some of the islands lying off the
northeast side of Madagascar; but it will be seen
that the plan is, for the present, defeated by the
political movements of the French in these quar
ters, and the hostility of the Romish priests. A
few days ago, I received a letter from Joseph and
Mary, extracts of which I forward by this opportu
nity. I am again cast down, for my plans are once
more frustrated. We had made up our minds to
establish a mission at Nosimitsio, which would be
likely to bear upon Madagascar; but the French
have taken possession of the island, and a Catholic
priest has fixed his abode there, and driven away
our teachers, so that now we have no hope of being
able to do any thing there more than at Nosibe,
Nosifaly, and Nosikomba. The four islands are
now in the possession of the French; and I am
told, by good authority, that they design taking pos
session of a large portion of the north of Madagas
car before the close of this year, and that prepara
tions are now making for it. They also intend to
take Mqjanga, nor is it expected that they will stop
until they gain possession of the whole island.”—
Evangelical Magazine.
The Nelson Testimonial_The colossal statue
of our immortal naval hero, which is destined to be
placed on the top of the column in Trafalgar-square
is now completed. The statue is seventeen feet
six inches nigh, and has been formed from two
great blocks and one smaller one (for the left arm)
of Cragleith stone, from the Granton quarry. This
stone is fine grained and remarkably hard. The
figure has been designed by Mr. Baily with great
simplicity and truthfulness of character, represent
ing the heroic Nelson precisely as he might be sup
posed to have stood on the quarter-deck of the Vic
tory at the moment when he gave forth thS memo
rable signal, “ England expects that every man
will do his duty.” His costume, even to the small
cocked hat, is faithfully represented; and his left
hand rests upon his sword hilt.
Wesleyan Methodism in Ireland.—It is an in
teresting circumstance that at this juncture, when
political affairs wear so troubled an aspect in Ireland,
a new and beautiful Wesleyan Chapel should be
opened (aswe observe in the “Wesleyan Intelli
gence” in this day’s Watchman) in Clonmel, in
the heart of Tipperary, which has long had a bad
fame as the most turbulent county in the land.
Would that such instrumentalities could be mul
tiplied a hundred fold! The declaration of the
gospel of the grace of God, in its pure Anti-Popish,
—Anti-Puseyite,—simplicity, is, after all, the Pro
clamation that would most effectually tranquillize
Ireland.—English paper.
Emigration—The general emigration from the
United Kingdom in the year 1842, reached an ex
tent never before attained, no fewer than 128,344
persons having emigrated in the course of it to the
different British colonies. During the first six
months of the present year, the emigration has
greatly decreased, only 38,226 having left the Uni.
ted Kingdom. From a comparison of the emigra
tion during the first six months of 1842 and 1843,
respectively, it appears that the decrease on the
half-year is 66,081.
Prince Mohenloe, of miracle-working celebrity,
but of whom we had heard nothing for some time,
is stated, in a letter from Inspruch, to have per
formed by prayer some new miracles there during
the last month. Among the persons stated to have
been cured, were the daughter of. a Counsellor of
the Court of Appeal of the Tyrol, after a painful
illness of three years, and a woman of fifty-five who
had been for several years afflicted with paralysis.

The Chinese and the Opidm Trade.—The Bos
ton Journal says that the late advices from China
state that the Emperor has not abated in his hostil
ity to the use of this pernicious drug. But late
information states that he has been so sickened
with the results of war, which grew out of his in
terferences with the opium trade, that the local
Mandarins have orders to shut their eyes to the
daily infractions of the law.
Sad Coincidents.—An inquest was held at the
King’s Arms, Greenwich, on the body of James
Bradly, aged fifty-six, an in-pensioner of Green
wich Hospital, and one of the gallant veterans of
Trafalgar, who was accidentally drowned on the
evening of the anniversary of “ Trafalgar day,” at
Trafalgar stairs, having just left the Trafalgar
Tavern, with his Tratalgar medal on his breast.
Verdict, “ Accidental death.”

Laying the Corner Stone of Cincinnati
Observatory.—Hon. John Quincy Adams perfor
med the ceremony of laying the corner stone of an
Astronomical Observatory in Cincinnati on the 9th
ult. The day was inclement,—yet multitudes as
sembled, though exposed to the rain, to hear Mr.
Adams. After a speech replete with pertinent re
mark, Mr. Adams addressed himself to the ceremo
ny as follows:
“ Fellow Citizens!—The Astronomical Society
of Cincinnati have determined to wipe the reproach
■from the fair fame of our beloved country.—Here
—upon this spot, they have determined, shall arise
an edifice, devoted to the cultivation and advance
ment of the science of Astronomy,—devoted to a
skilful and persevering search into the laws of the
physical creation. For the execution of this pur
pose, they have done me the honor to invite me from
a distance of a thousand miles, to come and share
with them, in the office of laying the corner-stone
of that edifice. And for the performance of that
service we are now assembled.
“ Let us proceed then so to do, and here in the
presence of the vast multitude of the free citizens
of the United States of America, of the State of
Ohio, and of the city of Cincinnati, I do lay this
corner-stone, invoking the blessing of Him in whose
presence we all stand, upon the building which is
here to rise and upon all uses to which it is to be de
voted—upon the observators and other officers who
may be employed in it,—upon the Society by whose
will it iB constructed, upon the people of the Socie
ty by whose will it is constructed, upon the people
of the city where it will stand, and the State to
which they belong, and finally upon the whole North
American Union, and the whole brotherhood of

Condition and Prospects of tbe Western
ImbibNE.1—A Wltor frtta Fort TbWWOn Statin that
the put season has been unfavourable to health
and to the labours of the agriculturist of that re
gion' Many of the Choctaws and Chickasaws have
died. Their corn and cotton crops have not been,
so productive as in .former years, although they
have devoted more labour to their fields, abandoning
almost entirely their idle and vicious amusements
of ball-playing, and employing their whole time
upon their farms.
Civilization is rapidly progressing among In
dians, under the humane policy of our Government
in its protecting intercourse with them. They
now, with the simple domestic loom, manufacture
nearly all their wearing apparel, and the products
of their farms furnish them with money, which
they also barter with their traders for such luxuries
and other articles as they may require.
They have teachers, preachers, and temper
ance lecturers among them; and with all these
advantages, together with the richness of the soil
and location of the country, if they do not become
rich and happy: they are truly a perverse race.
Repudiation.—The Mobile Herald has an anec
dote on this subject, too good to be lost. A merchant
of Mobile, and an American by birth, was recently
on a visit to Liverpool, where a branch of his house
was established, the head of which was a Scotch
man. At a dinner given by his partner, a number of
merhants and capitalists were present; and though
the Mobilian made great efforts to avoid any dis
cussion in reference to American securities, yet as
the old codgers at the table, the majority of whom
were from good old Scotia, insisted upon the matter,
he was compelled to listen to their long tirades
against Repudiation. In answer to their assaults,
he observed that only one State had repudiated;
and that was Mississippi. Inquiry was made how
she happened to stand alone in this matter?—the
Mobilian replied that they had a very curious man
for Governor, named McNutt, but that he was not
an American. The whole company demanded
his birth place. “ Why,” said the Mobilian, “ he
is a most obstinate and cross-grained old Scotch
man.” After a broad look at each other, the con
versation immediately turned upon other subjects!
Native Gold.—The last number of Annals of
the Mine contains an interesting accountof a mass
of native gold which was discovered on the 26th of
October, 1842, in the Ural Mountains. This is the
largest known mass in the world. It was found in
the auriferous sands of the Miask, not far from the
famous mines of Bzatevo Nickoolaesf, and Bzatevo
Alexandrofsk in the Southern Ural. It weighs no
less than eighty-one pounds, and has been placed
in the Russian Museum of the Mining Engineer^
Institute. According tc Humboldt, the largest
masses of gold which have yet been discovered are
those of Rio Hagua, found in 1502, weighing,
15,500 grains,—one found in North-Carolina, 1821,
weighing, 21,700 grains,—another, in Miask, 1826,
weighing, 10,118 grains,—and that now described,
weighing 36,020 grains.
Antiquity of Shaving the Beard—Mr. Glid
don, the Egyptian traveller, in hie lecture on Egypt,
before an animation in Boston, a few evenings
since, stated that Egyptians were the only early
people of Oriental nations who shaved With them
as with the Arabs, the barber was a dentist and
jobbing surgeon. There are several paintings in
Egypt representing shaving as well as other parts
of the barber’s functions. The Jews wore their
beards, but it is recorded in Gen. xiii. 14, that Jo.
seph, when summoned from his dungeon by Pha
raoh, u shaved himselfSo that the Bible enables
us to carry shaving back to 1800 years B. C.f
whilst the sculptures in the tombs round the pyra
mids, prove its universal use in Egypt several cen
turies before that date.
Court House Burnt.—The Natchez (Missis
sippi) Courier of the 11th instant, says: “The
courthouse in Claiborne county was consumed by
tire on Tuesday night last. The edifice was a
beautiful and costly one, and an ornament to the
handsome town of Port Gibson. It is supposed to
have been set oi^fire by some incendiary. The fire
originated in the clerk’s office. All the books are
said to have been burned, though most of the more
valuable papers were saved.
Sea Sickness.—A correspondent of the London
Lancet states that he has accidentally discovered
that vinegar and salt form, in many cases, a remedy
for sea sickness. He took it in the proportion of a
tea-spoonful of salt to half a wine-glass of vinegar;
but the patient can mix the dose to suit himself.
The writer says that although very sick when he
swallowed the vinegar and salt, he was immediate
ly able to eat a hearty dinner, with two glasses of
sherry, experiencing no nausea afterward, let the
ship pitch as it might.
An Iron Ship.—The bark Iron Queen arrived at
New-York on Wednesday from Bahia. This ves
sel was built at Aberdeen, (Scotland,) and is about
three hundred and fifty tons burthen. The hull is
built entirely of iron, fastened to iron ribs; the deck
plank is bolted to iron beams; her keel is three
inches keep, and is hollow, into which what water
Bhe makes flows, and is readily pumped out by a
pump in the centre.
Indian Missionary.—A nephew of the late
Seminole chief Oceola, preached on the'18th ult.,
in the Methodist Episcopal Church at Little Rock,
with remarkable effect. He is only nineteen, has
received an English education, and goes on a mis

Death of a Daughter of Mb. Everett.—We
sincerely regret to learn, by the last steamer from
England, that Mr. Everett, our estimable resident
Minister at the Court of St. James, has met a se
vere affliction in the death of his eldest daughter,—
a young and gifted girl, just entering society.
Rights of married women.—The bill securing
to married women the use and enjoyment of their
separate property, with an amendment charging the
separate properly of the wife for all necessaries
furnished the family by her written order, has passed

Cincinnati, it is said, a few evenings since, discover,
ed a fifth moon to Jupiter, while viewing the heaven
ly bodies through a telescope, at the Mechanics’
Institute.
A Remarkable temperance movement is in
progress among the soldiers at Jefferson Barracks;
A society has been formed, and upwards of five

It is now stated, positively, by a correspondent
