INAUGUR-ATION OF GOV. AIKEN.
This event. en Tuesday last, attracied
a most-crowded and brilliant auditory from
hi beauty and fashion, respeota! 'ity and
-disti-otion, of all parts of the State. An
accoont of.the ceremonies of the occasion
will be fcund in the Legislative proceedings
of the two houses ; but the most interest
ig feature of it, to our readers at least, is
the able- and approptiate Addiess, *hich
we have the pleasure of laying befrb
them below. It is highly creditable to the
talenta ,aq:ftelitgs.Sand principles of its
intelligent author, whose gentlemanlike
manners, and highly cultivated mind, em
ivmenty'eriched from-the -varied resources
ofeducation, study, and travel, amply
qualify-him to fill the high office to which
he has been so tiatteringly elevated, with
honor to hiinself, and. benefit to. the-State.
His addres-vas warmly. received. .The
puttion particularly- which franklynand
adhly pledges.Jim to sustain the sovereign
will and authority of the;State. -was en
thsiastielyapplaudedI and if -there be
abi partof it to which our Tariff-worn
aid Abolition persecuted people cannot
respond itis that in which he congrat*
ulates them.: upon the dawunof a brighter
day. No:matter; if disappointed as we
deeply fear he will be, he - will none the
less boldly - and faithfully and fearlessly
strive to defbd them alike from open ene
mies, and false and faithless friends. May
He to whom the Rulers of the People are
chief instruments of good or evil to them,
be ever near him, and guide and direct
rim to be fruitrul and memarebte blessing
to those who have so generously and con
Sdingly put tireir trust in him.
O:dniacn of the Scnateeaud.
House of Repretadives:
Tour kindness and partiality have indu
ced you to select me as the Chief 3agis
trate of Sooth-Carolina.
It is with feelings of the highest appre
ciation for the distinguished honor,.that 1,
tender you my unfeigned acknowleig
Ments for this proof of your generous con
fidence, and it is scarcely necessary for me
tb say, that gratitude a[one wVould impel
me to the exertion of every faculty I pos
sea, in advaneeing the prosperity and
promoting the laterests of the State.
While I caunot hope that under my
idance, the administration of public af
'rs will be condueted with that ability
which has characterised the labors"of him.
whom I am called upon to succeed, I shall
tet enter upon the diseharge of my high
and responsible duties, with a fixed deter
mnjoation, vigilantly to watch over and
protect every interest committed to. my
care and superintendence.
It will not be expected that ab an occa
sion like the present I shotld -enter into a
particular diseussion of any of the leading
topies whieh so deeply Interest our people;
but a general allusion to some of the most
lapbrtaat, may not be considered as entire
ly inappropriate.
After a lung and unprecedented embar
rassment of our financial coccers,affecting
individual, as well as national properity,
paralyzing the energiet and crippling the
resonrces of the country, the dawn or a
brighter day, seems about to illumine the
horigon.
This citeeting and reesonablo prospect
dan scarcely fail to attain its realization,
if they, to whom is etitrusted the manage
ment of our'uational ailairs, will but bear
in mind, that the legitimate ends of Gov
ermout can only be effected by the care
flt avoidance of a policywhich, under the
saeted sanction of law, flicehes from the
hard earnings of an honest industry, to
minister to the appetite of an insatiable
avarice.
It would be strining the 'imagination,
even to'a painful hktent, to concbive the
high point or national prosperity we'might
have reached, under an administration of
equal justiee and equal protection, wh'en,
in despite oftheblightinginfnaeuces which
a contrary coorse has exercised upon our
own partienlar section, it must be confes
ead that ihr'more .than half a century, du
ring which we have been united under
the federal compact, oue whole country
has made tapid progress not only in the
increase of her population, but the moss
extensive improvement in the' grts and
scinhces, and in short, in every thing cal
entlated to minlyt ahe':etnrforte, elevate
the condition, and adlvpteelhe happiness
of mankind.
'A long and enduring peate a tee
has happily directed the minds of our
citizens from the sangfuinary pursuits of
war, to the more -usefnl and substactial
ocengationu of life. The sword of the
warrtorlmee been converted into the plough
share of the husbandman. Important en

perity almost beyood the teacli of coutin-:
gency, but a wise end equable general
legislation, which shall respect the -rights
of oar country as a tihole, without the
slightest aggression upon any of its parts.
T[he increasa of our territory,aoo, has
been commensurate with .the rising im
portanee of a great and flourishing peo -
ple; and a firm reliance on the justice
and intelligence of the age, gives strong
asseiranee, that not withstanding the late
rejection of the treaty by the Senate of the
United Stafeei, the pedod is not- far -dis
tant, when; Texiks, a land populated by
our brethren and, oar kindeed, will be
gathered'into otif broad fold, and . numbe

dont eovereigniies.
With regard to etir own State, we
have much to congratolate ourselves. -Not
withstanding the share wae have had in the
general embarrasment of the country, and
the several calamitous 'visitations, by
which large portionso oneu mfoat populous
cities, have been deselated and laid waste,
our affairs are beginning so assume a more
propitous aspect.

Uterous economy, promises to place our
advancement on a sure. and enduring
foundatisi.
The suject.of abolition is one which
calls rather for the most unrelaxing vigi
lance, than for any discussion upon our
part. Recent events make it perhaps pro
per that , should some allusion to it. The
State of Massachusetts having sent in
agent here to test the constitutionality of a
law'enacted for the safety and protection
ofour peculiar institution, South-Carolina,
through her Legislature, has adopted those
prompt and ready measures which must
convice our enemies that, upon this sub
ject, we suffer no foreign interference. It
was a necessary lesson, and I trust will
have its proper effect,
I know that South-Vorolii feels deep
ly the present system of unjust and
unconstitutional taxation, imposed upon us
by the federal government. And that she
is also gravely irppresed ivith tiose vital
and paramount questions that have arisen,
connected with her peace, and her domes
tic institution. I hope that justice will be
done.us by those who will have the po*r.

should be disappointed in this most reaso

RE-OLUTIONS
In reference to a Special Agency e nt
from the State of Ma ssucuetts.
SUBMMITTED a Ma. DE TREVI..LE.
WairavAs, information hav been recei
ved, that the State of Massachusetts has
recently appointed and sent to the City of
Charleston a Special Agent. with instrue:
tions and authority to institute proceedings
at her expense in the court' of the .United
States, for the purpose of testing the con
stitutionality of a certain Act of this State,
passed on the 19th day of December, An
no Domiri 1835, entitled "An Act more
effectually. to prevent Free Negroes and
other persons of color from entering into
this State, and forother . purposes."
And, whereas, we have always regarded
the aforesaid.law as necessary measure
for the secuty of our property, and the
peace and good order of society; and re
cent indications have .not only proved that
:we were not mistaken, but that nothing
short of the most rigid enforcenent of the
-said law to its very letter, can save us
from the insiduous policy .and practice of
the abolitionists
Tdnrefore, Resolved, That while we
admit the right of the State of Massachu
setts to elevate the descendants of the
African race to the rank or standing of free
white persons, and to confer on 'them all
the rights and immunities which the most
favored of her citizens enjoy wothin her
own limits, we deny that she has any
right to require us to extend to such of
them as may enter our limits, the immu
nities and privileges which are secured by
the Constitutiou of the United States, to
her free white citizens alone.
Resolved, That the State of South
Carolina ought not to submit to any dicta
tion, eitber from a sister State or from the
Supreme Court of the United States, on a
subject of such vital importance to herself
as the government of her colored popula
tion; and should the aforesaid Act be
declared unconstitutional and invalid hy
the Federal courts, the principle of self
preservation will neverless com pet her-citi
zeus, at every expeuse of life and proper
ty, to uphold and maintain the due and
rigid enforcement of tbe said la w, acc(.rding
to its very letter and spirit.
Resoled, That the conduct of the State
of Massachusetts, in attempting to procure
by Federal Judicial Legislation, the repeal
of a law, which was intended to be and is
a barrier between the slave and the emis
saries of the abolitionists, is an un warran
table and gross insult to the people of this
State.
WVHIO IS JAM ES Kt. POLK?
A Correspondent of the New-York
Journal of Commerce thus speaks of him:
"I had the honor of taking tea at hsis
house last evening, and of enjdying the
socety of himself and his amiable and
splendid lady. His features are strongly
marked by evidences of intellect. bliud
ness, firmnness and bienevolence. His
head .would be esteemed a splended model
by phrenologists. in which the intellectual
and moral fuculties are largely predomi
nant. His forehead is high, broad and
fll, and perpendicular, if njot projecting.
The upper part of the head rises high
above the ears. The organs of benevo
ence, veneratdob ied firmness, arb pronm
inently developed. Col. Polk's chaf-acter.
through a long public life, is known to
crrespond with these characteristics of his
mind. He represented the Congressioral

Mll, with ote at~eord, declare that they

a kInder master, a mote iridulgent and
and faithful husband,.or a more upright,
honest, benevolent: and motal man they
never knew, His lady isboth beautiful and

Cotuista, Dec, 10, 1844.
To-day His Excellency. Gov. Aiken.
'was duly inaugarated, in solemn form, at
12 o'clock. The Senate joined the House
in the spacious and elegant ebamber of
the latter, and at the hour indicated, His
Excellency appeared, chdhbtd by the
ex-Governor, the Secretary of State, the
Adjutant General, the Quarter Master
General, and attended by a suite of soe
eight or ten.very handsome young getlo.
men. The air and manner of the ertre
gave augury that the spectators were to
be' gratifted still more by the furtlier cer
emonies. Uion His Excellency's assu
ming the seat provided, the Speaker or
dered the doors of the Chamber to be
opened to the public, when a vast throng
filled the space and adorned the Hall with
lovely specimcns of the sprightliness, wit
god beauty of this city and the adjaeent
counlry. When order was established,
His Excellency .arose and delivered fom
the Speaker'! deals an address replete with
patriotic and fervent expressions of reeling
and characterized by a style clear..digni.
fed and precise. He gtledged himself to
sustain the' interest, dignity and honor of
South Carolina. As this document,
however, will be published, (it is presu
med.) we will not attempt in our own
language to set forth its merits His Ex
ceflency was, then conducted by the Seu
ite to their Chamber, where the House of
Representatives .having joined 'he former
body, the venerable President delivered
the comhission to His Excellency. The
whole ceremony closed with the usual pro
clamatton from the portico of jihe State
House. His Excellency was then escor
ted to his hotel by two very lne military
cinpauies the Gotenors Guhrds, coMI
manded by Capt Tradewell, and the Col
ege Cadte, by Capt. Brown Manning.
Here was a beautiful contrast between the
civil ceremonies which declared His Ex
cellency the Chief Magistrate, and the
military display seemed to welcoine him
as the cmmander-inchief.
The admninistration ofLGoV. Aiken com
mences with the fairest sunshine. May be

strength orpurpose wihich has always dis
inguimhed him, in carrying the Stare

Thre tiescinaing of the 25th Rule, *hich
will now allow Mr. Adams to have all his
abolition petitions read and perhaps de
baed, has produced some excitement in
the south, and give:n an opportunni.y to
some southern whig to taunt us respecting
our northern democratic friends in Con
gress. Before we express fitnopinion on
the course pursued by the tnorthern demo
cratic members of the popular branch of
Congress, we shall wvait for further infer
matien in regard to the mntives which led
them to vote as they did. In the mean~
time we must observe that the qotithern
whigs should keep as qutiet as they ptos
sibly can, If they cotideman the utnrthernt
democratic members for their votes,
what can they say of the membaers of their
own creed? On the motion to rescind
25th rule, the yeas were 108. And what
was the complexion of this vote?.
For the motion there were.

Ma-k, reader, there were 5-5 northern
democrats, 48 northern wvhigs and 5
sothern w higi. Not one soulthern democrat
voted for the motion. Trhe 5 southern whigs
who voted for rescinding the rule, were
Messrs. Kenedy, Prestou, and Wethered
of Maryland- Clingman of North Carolinat;
and White of Kentucky

thorized to collect Notes and Accounts due
this office, in this and the adjoming - Districts.
We hope our friends will avail thenselves of
so favorable an opportunity for liquidating their
respective amounts.
fu consegnence of the press of matter, the
third letter or Rev. Wm. I. Johnson, in reply
to the Rev. V. Hooper, is crowded out.
Mesiage qf President Tyler.-The great length
of the President's Message Precludes its entire
insertion in our paper. We have. however,
omitted nothing of importance.
Lieutenant Goceror.-At the recent election
for GovErnor.and Lientenatt Governor, of
South Carolina, Air. Johnt J. Erwin. of Mlt.
borough, was elected Lieutenant Governor.
A i6der Large Th-nip.-We were presented
bb bohday last, by our old frienil, Mr.,Chai-les
Compiy, the worthy landlord of the Mlansion
House. with a fine large deliciont Twin Tur.
nip. This Turnip is really a ciiriosity, and in
a hueasure, resembles the Sianese 'twins; it
weighs five pounds. Wit. wyill keep it at the
office for a few days, foi the inspection of the
curious.
Buekshin Purses -A fetv' days since, we saw
some. eatly finished Buckskin Purses,
for sale, by a North Carolina Wagoner. They
were so made as to close tightly at the topand
ii would be difficult for a rogue, who was not
in the secret, to abstract the contenis of one of
them. They were readily purchased by seve
ral persons in. tho vil uge. This is a good.
sign, as ii show*s that those p'ersoni have mo.
ney, or expect to have. For ourselves we did
not buy a purse, as we had no money to put itn
it. We have a little old areasy wallet which
it would delight us much to fill. Will not our
gdod frIends and patrons help us to do so?
Democratic Celebration at Augusta. Ga.- -On
Tt.esday evening ihe 10th instant, otrr Demo.
ciatic neighbors at the above mentioned place,
celebrated the election of Polk and Dallas. by a
brilliant display of fire-works and a hundred
discharge of ordnance. No accident occur.
red to mar the festivity of the occasion.
A friend has presented us with a small sam
ple of Sugar and Molasses. Which was mantu
factiured by Capt. Ulesses M. RonEtT of Barn
well Di.!rict, from a lot of cane, grown on hi.
plantation the present year. The cane giew
upon tivo acres of. ordinary pine land for that
section of the District, being well prepared and
highly manured before planting The summer
proved favorable to its growth, and the autumn
*o its maturity, io frost having fallen; material
ly to injure it. Te product of the two acres
was eigat barrels of Sugar and a proportiona
ble quantity of Mclasses.-The samples of
both. would be pronounced good for any see -
tion of the sngar region, and the sugar readily
cotmmands $8 per l00lbs. in the neighborhood
This is a highly encouniaging experiment.
which we recommnend to otur planters genteral

which lire no* farmished i' the Western

Picxars's RESOLUTIONS,
Mr. Editvr.As a citizen 6f South Caro

the honor and safety of the State. I have sead
in the Charleston Mercury certain strictures
nupon the Senate Resolutions, or rather upon
the mover of them, which I regretted to see in
that highittoned, repubican print. One would
stlppose, on reading these strictures, that the
resolutions were cravenly and submissive in
their tone, and huible in their language-that
the author had lost all his reverence for the
doutrine of State Rights. which he so manfully
snetaitead in 1P32 and '33-in one word, that
the resohitions4 had abandoned the whole
ground of State sotereignty. and tie consequent
right of State interference.should itbecnie
