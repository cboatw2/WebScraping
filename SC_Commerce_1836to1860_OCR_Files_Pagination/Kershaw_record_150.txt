"lUilUon* <tr iefeaoe Rut not one cent
cor inoaie."
Mr. Editor.?The object of the convention,
now being held at Augusta, Ga.
lias tho hearty approbation of every true
son of the south. Our present commercial
connexion with the north is ruinous,
and humiliating, and must end, if not
changed, in the utter, and permanent,
degradation of the whole slave-holding
\ region. But I apprehend that such con.
venlions can accomplish but little towards
our commercial emancipation, while the
fiscal action of the great central government
shall continue, as it has done for
half a century, to create heavy annual
balances against the south, turning the
course of exchanges, and irrcsistably diverting
our trade from its natural channels.
Is it not obvious, sir, that the southern
slates, with their fine piftts, with free
egress to the ocean at all seasons of the
year, and lying right in front as it were,
of the great commercial' countries of Europe,
would, unless there were powerful
counteracting causes, carry on a direct
inward and outward commerce with those
countries, which now, consume their staples
and furnish their supplies. This,
sir, is the natural, and I am assured was
the actual course of trade till the "Amcrican
System" of Tariffs, United States
Hanls, and unequal disbursements, of the
common treasure of the coXintry, counter*
acted, and perverted, as it were,the course
of nature, turning our rich streams 01
commerce through unnatural channels.
Let those who can satisfactorily account
for the present ruinous and degrading
commercial dependence of the south upon
the north, upon any other hypothesis than
that just stated. Let me illustrate?suppose
the natural course of trade nou
restored. Then the staple growing states
would export directly, 80 millions of theii
own productions; and consequently, import
annually, an equal amount for more.
Upon this amount with the present average
rate of taxes?say 25 per cent., there
would be collected the enormous sum ol
20 millions of dollars. Of this amount
tinder the present system of disbui tementj
15 millions would be remitted bcyonc
Mason and Dickson's line ; and, undei
Mr.' Van Buren's hard money system, tlu
15 millions would be packed up in boxct
and transported to New York,' Philadelphia,
Boston, &c., to liquidate our annua
Qccounl of tribute money. But bcitu
paid in gold and silver, would not aggravate
the injustice, but only make it more
palpable to common observation?15 mil
lions in Cotton and Tobacco, or in bill;
drawn on the proceeds, these articles
would be just as onerous, it is obvious
tlicn, that under a system of direct trade
the south would be annually rendered bj
operation of law tributary to the north
to the amount of 15 millions of dollars
Now, sir docs any one suppose that the
present circuitous system, renders the
burden on the south less onerous than i
our exports and imports took their nntura
course. Docs any southern man delude
himsclfso far as to believe lie fescapes the
tax on foreign imports because the New
York Merchant pays it in the first instance
or that it varies the case to our advantage
that they do not return us the value of ou;
exports in the identical articles importet
for those exports. Let no one be so de
reivpd ? fir nn mnlfrr in wlmt llmv nm
us, whether in gold or silver, or theii
own productions, they will not fail t<
retain in their own tenacious hands, th<
amount of taxes expended; besides heavj
commissions, profits, <kc.
My position then is, that, the fiscal ac
A /* .1 1 /W - . t
nun o/ trie uencrai uovernmeni is itu
root of all the evil, and here the soutl
must strike. Conventions of southeri
Merchants may, and I believe will d<
good, by awakening the public attention
and eliciting and imparting information
But the over action, and unequal actior
of the fiscal and political system of th?
nation must he corrected before the bod)
commercial can right itself.
Unless this can be done, the south mus
continue to languish, ond finally fall i
victim' to the overshadowing wealth, po
litical> power and physical force o( th<
north.
