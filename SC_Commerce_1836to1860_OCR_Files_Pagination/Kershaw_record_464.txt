SOUTH CAROLINA LEGISLATURE.
Report of the Committee on Federal Relations.
[Concluded.]
Tlie unfounded allegation tliat Gen.
Harrison's election would raise the value
of property, is already in part exposed.
He is elected, and yet money remains (lie
same; property the same. The more
cunuing part of his advocates, are hoarding
tlieir means to buy at a sacrifice, the
estates of the dupes u ho united with tnem
in clamouring foi change. The mild and
gradual effect of the separation of the
Government from bunking, the gradual
return to the collection of the Revenue in
money, and the Independent Treasury,
were eflicacious remedies for a redundant
circulation. The hope that any change
of administration could save one whose
obligation, payable by the laws and Constitution,
in specie, is outstanding, for
property bought at prices swollen by speculation
and depreciated circulation, from
the consequent loss, was too fallacious
for an honest Democratic Administration
to hold out, and the proposal to cripple
all the State Banks by placing a regulator,
with chartered privileges, to compel them

is the most cruel mockery, and the curses
of a ruined country, deep and loud too
will fall upon its authors. The Independent
Treasury, and a well advised General
Bankrupt Law, applicable to all dealers,
was the true means of relief. Now,
the wealthy capitalists alone, have any
piospect of profiling by this reiterated experiment
of a Federal rule, which has always
ended in disappointment to the people.
Not only is a United States Bank
unnecessary, but "he idea of its money
being in fact any better than the money
of specie paying Banks of the States,
where its Branches are situaieu, except
forthe unjust monopoly of being receivable
in paymeiK of dilties, although not
redeemable in specie where so paid; a
monopoly, the fruits of which, are reaped
by foreign stockholders. Such an institution
is evidently unconstitutional, and
the existence of such a Bank, is only a
proof how pressing emergencies form an
excuse for a departure of principle, and
how readily good men slide into the heresy
in morals, that " the end justifies the
means."
The constitutional objection to a Bank,
chartered by the United States, has never
been fairly met, and as human reason is
just as clear as ever it was, the time has
arrived when the people will again resort
to first principles, and test the point by
sound and connected argument. Let us
trace the history of this Institution from
its embryo. In 1780, during the Revo*
lotionary War; the Bank of North America
was chartered by the Continental Congress.
The inducement was, that the
Bank was to furnish the Army 3,000,000
rations, and 300 hhds. rum, and receive
in payment Bills of exchange on our Minister
in Europe. The subscription or capital
was to be in gold and silver. Even
then so jealous were the statcmen of that
day, that they required "every evening
except Sundays, a statement of the cash
account, and the notes issued and received,
and to bo delivered to the Superintendant
of the finance of America." The
exigences of the country were the excuse,
and the States requested to carry into effect
its provisions by State laws. Thus,
a United States Bank was known prior to
the Constitution, and was the subject of
debate in the Convention. This Bank
took a charter from Pennsylvania afterwards.
The question generally of giving
to Congress power to grant acts of Incor8oration,
and also to incorporate a Bank,
lr. Madison says was fully considered,
the power refused; and now the question
ari^p, has Congress that power? As to
the array of great names in favor of the
position, it is enough to say, the present
generation are endowed with ttie same intellectual
powers as their predecessors,
and with the same facts before them, can
arrive at as wise a conclusion; and the
pressure ui oiaie ur-ces&uj uciu? *cwv>?ed,
they have a better prospect of arriving
at the conclusions of unbiased teason.
The United Slates, and its Congress,
possess no inherent power or original existence,
as a body politic, but is composed
solely of such sovereign powers, as
the States have by the Constitution grauted.
It results that the omission to grant
is a prohibition to the exercise of any of
the powers appertaining to a government.
The people of the several States, as independent
and sovereign powers, possessed
all the attributes of Nations, and so much,
and no more, of those attributes, as are
in terms surrendered to it, by the instrument
which created the United States
Government appertains to it.
It is admitted that the United States is
a Government, capable of sustaining its
existence, and not a mere league; but the
limits of its authority arc dotim-ated in
the Constitution, without which it has no
existence, and beyond which it can exercise
no legitimate authority. f,vt us then
look into this instrument for the authority
to create a body corporate, and grunt
to it the monopoly of hating its promises
to pay coin received in every quarter ol
the Union for the duties and tines of Ununited
Stales, and the use of its revenues
to lie loaned out on the promissory notes
of individuals, rind to receive the interest
for the equivalent of paying tjie deposits

asked in direct terms, and let us apply
the celebrated rule, "to ask the lawgiver
what he mean!,'' and it is clear, that he
did not intend that to be implied which he
had expressly refusrrd. But independent
of this refusal, the terms of the Conslitu- Jo
lion canhot be construed to imply such n if
power. It has been infered from ihe pow- k
cr "to lay and collect taxes for the gen- b
J eral welfare." To incorporate a Bank, e
lays no tax for any purpose. Alexander p
Hamilton, the great originator of such a ti
Bank, told the honest truth; as to what it ti
i was intended to be: "It is to be consider- n
1 ed that such a Bank is not a mere matter n
i of private property, but a political ma- 8
j chine, of the greatest importance to the b
; State." Congress has no power to raise ti
mnncv to invest in a Bank, any more than c
in a v. haling voyage, or any other money S
making business. The term "general i
welfare," is used to designate the object d
! of raising taxes. If every thing that will o
bring money into the public purse, is au- c
thoriscd under the power to raise taxes t;
then charters to fishing companies, fur
companies, and companies for all purpo- c
ses of trade and manufacture, by requir- A
ing a bonus would bring money into the s
public purse. Yet no such charters were tl
ever applied for. To exact a bonus for a li
charter is not a tax, but the price of a n
[government grant of a monopoly, and a ii
monopoly is so much taken from the mass n
of the people to be conferred on a privi- fl
leged class. The right does not result r
from the power "to borrow money." A
Bonk charter borrows no money. It is a d
fearful stretch of construction to imply v
it is a " necessary and proper" way to li
borrow money, to call into existence a a
corporation to lend it?not to lend its mo- n
ney, but the promissory notes. The pow- u
er is to borrow money. Now, by the h
Constitution, Congress may 4 coin money, ti
and regulate the value thereof, and of v
foreign coin." No other money was then tl
known. Paper?bills of credit, were ne- b
i ver known as money, but a substitute for m
it. Who ever heard of engraving money? c
Neither is it, "necessary and proper,'' or h
either, to create a corporation, to aid in n
laying and collecting taxes, or to create a a
lender that Congress may borrow. It S
would apply as well to Trust Companies, P
Loan OlFices, and Whaling companies.? 1
These might be taxed, or they might lend il
their notes, or even their money, but are; b
they both 4 necessary and proper?' The j o
people may be taxed, and money may be j <\
borrowed of individuals. The Slates Jn
have the right to prohibit the circulation b
as money of any thing but gold and silver, si
and vet if Congress have the power to ft
W w
incorporate a Bank, they must protect its l(
issues, punish the forgery of them, and l'
thus usurp a clear State Right by implica- tt
tion. Every implication of a grant is 0
confined to such as are direct, and both c
necessary and proper in the usual and na-j ti
tural acceptation of the terms, else itjci
leads to unlimited power, every means jE
becomes in its turn an end, and thus justi- j I
fies the use of means still more remote, j ?
until absolute power is attained; and this ^
is pure Federal doctrine. Thus the Uni-|"
ted States may borrow money. To bor-!1'
row money, it is necessary and proper,: a
that there should be an accommodation je
of capital. To accumulate capital we d
must have a bank, with the power to engrave
Bank notes. There can be no Bank ('
of limited responsibility without a char- 11
ter, and prudent men will not unite in a
general responsibility; and therefore, l'
Congress having the power to borrow money,
has, by necessary implication, the is
power to incorporate stockholders with d
limited responsibility. Thus, the charter r
is the means of creating the Bank. The nr
liunk is the means ot collecting me capi- n
tal, and multiplying it thence to tenfold, rt
and this is the means of enabling the bank t<
to lend, and the United States to " borrow a
money." There is no power which the a
most unprincipled ambition might covet, b
which could not be attained by the same h
course of reasoning. Apply it to the tl
power to lay taxes; a corporation may be o
laxea, but to tax we must create it, there- r<
fore, under the power to lay taxes, Con- n
gress may create a manufacturing compa- o
ny, and impose a tax or bonus. Impress- p
mcnt into the Navy, and a conscription tl
for the Army, are legalized in the same z
way. This is Federalism, now in the as- U
cendant. Strict construction is the polar it
star of Democracy, destined again to n
emerge from the eclipse. o
A mrnoration is a new creation?it is a h
person noi before existing, and its crea-1 h
lion is an act of sovereign power, not
delegated. Had it been either necessary ti
or proper, it would have been as express- c
Iy granted as it was positively refused.? d
An idea once prevailed, that the prohibi- f;
tion to the States, to emit bills of credit, s
by implication conferred that power on z
Congress, and so it might create a Bank p
to emit paper money. If so, all bills of a
State banks are unconstitutional. But ti
in the first place, a chartered Bank is not ; ti
Congress, and delegated power cannot be j w
sub-delegated. But the whole error is' tl
founded upon a misapprehension of what r
' bills of credit,'are. They are promis- o
e? based on the credit of a State, and not e
! notes based on a bank capital. This has n
J been decided and admitted. The argu- n
incut chiefly relied upon, by the advo- t]
, ca es of a national bank, is that of the tl
laic Chief Justice Marshall, venerable ti
; for bis wisdom and experience; but that o
| gift of God, which is bestowed upon man- u
' ' * ' * ? - ? n/>*Tini? nf roo. ry
hint:, in every ugr, me pu?rti, ?i u
i s?ois, is still more venerable. An individ- c
; mil tnny be influenced by notions, or de- ll
j luded by the pressure of circumstance; ti
! but right reason, when unclouded by pre- A
! judice, is more to be relied on. Great c
and good men have maintained some mon- c
strous doctrines. Judge Marshall's argu* p
ment is all condensed in these words? s
the government which has?a right to do, c
an act, and lias imposed 011 it the duly f
f performing at act, mtisf, according to
le dictates of reason, be allowed to sesct
its means/' and any exception must
e proved. The doctrine leads to the inritable
conclusion, that Congress is sureme.
It must raise an army, conscripon
is a means, therefore you must show
lat it is prohibited. It ca.7 borrow moey,
therefore it can incorporate compa
ies, and great monopolies witnin me
(tales, to obtain a bonus." It at once
reaks down every barrier of the Constiution,
and makes the United States a
onsolidatcd nation, for of course, the
itates cannot gainsay what the United
itutes select us a means. Had such a
octrine been uttered by the dying breath
f Washington, it wouid be our duty to
hallenge it, as treasoD, to the sovereigny
of the States.
Your committee conclude, that the unompromising
history of the Democratic
administration to a national Bank, deerves
our most cordial approbation; and
4at the adoDtion of that measure, as a
jading and fundamental principle of the
ew administration, stamps it indeliby, as
a its very essence, the ligitimate expoent
of Federalism, and calculated to in*
ict upon the country, lasting misery and
uin.
Your Committee consider the Indcpenent
Treasury as strictly in accordance
/ith the Constitution, and well calculated
o place the commerce, manufactures, and
griculture uf the country upon a pcrmaent
and prosperous basis. By withdrawig
from all connection with trade, it
javes the Banking interest to be regula?d
by the States. By collecting the Recnue
in the coin of the country, it neidcr
opposes nor fosters these institutions,
ut leaves them to be estimated by those
-ho deal with them. If their notes are
qual to specie, those who possess them
avc no difficulty in oonverting them.into
loney when required for duties. If they
re not equal to money, and the United
Hates ought not to receive doubtful paer
in payment of debts due to the pnblic,
'here would have been no outcry against
icy collection of the Revenue in money,
ut flora the consciousness that the bills
f specie paying banks are not as good as
pecie. A specie paying Bank to-day,
lav be a suspended Bank to-morrow,
teturns and Exhibits have pioved no
ecurity. A Bank which is guilty of a
audulent issue of paper beyond its ability
) redeem it, will hesiate little to conver
lat fraud by false statements. When
e see the largest Bank in the Uni in and
nee graced with a United Stales charter,
irculating the hills of an extinct instituon,
based on no capital, what confidence
au be placed in the mere integrity of
lanks, or the fidelity of their statements?
t then results, that either the United
dates must guarantee the continuance of
ic solvency of the Banks, or the persons
'ho pay the duties must ascertain it by
actual exchange of the bills for money,
proceeding which can cause no difficulty,
xcept where the Banks are really not
cscrving of credit.
The right to lend money collected as
uties or taxes and thus convert it into
oles under any guarantee, is in conflict
'ith the letter and spirit of the Conslitu
on.
The next general feature of the adminitralion
of the present Chief Magistrate,
eserving the cordial approbation of evey
slave holding State, was the deterlined
policy early avowed, to withhold
is sanction to any measure impairing the
sserved rights of the South, in relation
3 her slave population. While we feel
n abiding confidence in the readiness and
bility of our State to protect its rights
y thoes means which God and nature
ave accorded to us, and never doubted
be noble spirit and elevated patriotism of
ur citizens; to meet any emergency, and
epel any aggression, and are resolved
ot to discuss lights which we permit no
x 11-11..
ne to question; wc rnusi cormany aprove
that faithful and just adherence to
ic Constitution, which will save our citiens
of oilier Stales from endangering the
rnion by their folly and fanaticism, and
lvolving themselves in a conflict that will
ot be abandoned as long as Carolina has
ue faithful citizen left to die in defence of
er integrity as a Stale, her interest or
er honor.
Your Committee unite with the Execute
in amazement at that delusion which
ould induce any Southern State to abanon
an administration which adhered most
lithfully to the doctrines which they have
trtiggled to maintain since 1800, and haard
their interest by coalescing with a
arty to which is allied the Federalists
nd Abolitionists; the advocates of a Naiolal
Bank, and the presevering solicits
of a Tariff of protection; and while
it rejoice to find ourselves associated on
lie one side with Virgina, the very nurse
y of Democracy and State Rights, and
n the other, by our own offspring, the
nlightened people of Alabama, we feel
o unkindness towards our immediate
eiffhbours. and are confident, reiving on
o ? * * ?j
(icir general good sense and right feelings,
^at the moment the developement of the
uc character of the combined and allied
pnoncnts of Democracy is exposed, they
ill promptly and cheerfully unite once
tore with us in sustaining a common
ause, with a sincerity and zeal worthy of
!icir elevated character, and their devoion
to therightsnnd interests of the South.
knd your Committee concur with his Exellency
in tlie belief, tliat the people of
very section of the Union firm in their
rinciples, and resolved in their purpoes,
will once more rally in the great
auso of Democracy, and reinstate in oficc
its origional and unwavering disciples.
V '
That the late election of President of ti
.the (J. States was corrupt and indecent, pi
wholly unworthy of a sober and discreet tt
public, and calculated to degrade our is
country, in the eyes of the world, obser- nr
ration and rumor, too well founded, it is tl
believed, induces us to lament. The resort o
to silly pageantries, ridiculous emblems, o
and vulvar dissination. was an insult upon d
? CI " I r
the dignity of freemen, and could only
proceed from an utter contempt of their
intelligence, and a readiness to degrade
them to the level of the servile populace tl
of transatlantic monarchies. That funds \i
to a vast amount were lavished,, was pal- 1
pable; and when it is recollected, that the o
prize to he giiued by opposition, was the 6
control of the revenues of the Union, the o
resuscitation ol an expiring raonied insii- ll
tution, whose stock is so largely owned t<
abroad, and above all, vlhe delusive hope ti
that there was a magic in change, that l<
would relieve men from 'the losses of im- tl
providence or misforlone, there is great p
reason to conclude that the elective fran- s
chise was polluted by most extensive bri- t
bery and corruption. , v
There'wasr a feature, too, in the late s
election, still more odious. Men high ^in (
station, and surrounded by the respect of s
the public, going about the country, infla- f
ming the passions, alarming the fears-, c
and misleading the judgments of the peo- a
| pie, was a spectacle degrading to our r
| whole country, degrading to us as a mor- t
! al and hivh-minded people, and can only p
o ? ? ? be
ascribed to that peculiarity in the human
character, which leads men, banded
together for a common purpose, to do
what, as individuals, they would revolt t;
at and repudiate. When men of charac- A
ter would assert, in the face of day, that ^
the distribution of the public treasure, ?
raised by the Representatives of the pco- v
pie, and paid away by appropriations s
made by law, was usurping "the power of
the purse," which every one knows is the v
power to raise money without the consent s
of the people; and still more absured, h
(hat they should represent militia men, fl
called out to drill, ten days in the year, c
as a standing army, we are amazed at the d
self-complacency that did not blush at the f
deception. No: the unpardonable sin of '1
the present administration was, its repu- e
diatingacharteredmonopoly, to reefcive c
loan the public treasure, and retaining it a
in the treasury of the United States?its f
gradual return to a sound, constitutional \
currency?and its resolution, not to entan- g
gle Government, with any money-dealers t
or stock-jobbres?but leave to the States to v
regulate their banking institutions as they t
deem best; and upon the wisdom and poli- t
cy of this great measure, South Carolina' s
concurs with it and is readv to renew the ! e
w" ~ ~
expression of its sanction and approval.
This State has only to repeat her objections
to q Tariff for protection, and
; when the Tariff Compromise ends, she s
expects a fair adjustment of a new Tariff 1
for revenue, in name and in fact. The 1
result of the election of President has
not shaken the faith of South Carolina c
in her long-cherished principles. c
t
From tho Globe. l
General Jackson and the Bank of *
the United States.?The public will j
recollect the earnestness with which Gen. a
Jackson, in several of his messages, ur- 8
ged the passage of laws to compel the I
complete winding up of the late Bank of ?
the United Stales, and the redemption j
and payment of its notes in circulation.? a
He plainly intimated his belief that the 11
public tvould be cheated in these notes, <
and the character of the United States suf- j jferin
consequence of their non-payment.: (
What his sagacity foresaw the public are i ^
! begining to see. These old dead notc6 a
are now outstanding to an unknown, but a
to a vast amount. They are seen in all f
the middle, Southern, and Western parts s
of the Union; and it seems to be no use to
send them to Philadelphia; for they are ||
immediately sent out again, and pushed p
into circulation. This is what we all see a
j here; but our London notices of the bank j t]
| give us some further insight into this bu-; a
isincss. Our readers know that the Uank j tj
I of the United States, in violation of its i a
'charter, and in contempt of the Pennsyl-j t|
i vania Legislature, refuses to make an ex-'
hibition of its affairs in this country; but]
it dare not act in that matter with its Urit,
ish owners: it is oblige to make exliibi-! n
Ilions to them; and accordingly the last!8
I London Morning Chronicle, the demi-of-1 P
ficial organ of what may be called mo- ^
dern Whiggery in England, and the ac s
credited organ of the Bank of the United ri
States, contains an exhibit of the situa- s
tion of the Bauk, by Mr. Jaudon, in which, a
while putting the best foot foremost, and i a
evidently encouraging the British sjock- .
holders to uphold the insolvent institution Jr
until the Harrison Administration can 'f
come to its relief, we see the following 11
item under the head of liabilities:
"Circulation of the late and present ,a
Bank, 89,725,508." "
Thus we sec an item of near ten millions JJ
of dollars of outstanding circulation, "
loin un/l nrncpilt Hank. This is I tl
liuau^u 1U bis U IlVi |/|vyv?
conclusive thai the notes of the old Bank P
are now outstanding, but to what amount
is a secret, concealed from the public by e
jumbling the two circulations together,
and making one item of the whole. Thus
is the sagacity of General Jackson made I
manifest, and besides that, new evidence ri
is afforded to cover the panic makers of'c
1S33?'1 with shame and confusion. These A
retainers of the Bank justified all her panic N
and pressure then, on the ground of her A
absolute necessity to wiud up in two years s;
?to collect her obligations and pay ail
her debts in that time; the circulation es- o
pecially was all to be redeemed ia that

lission of the Bank, seven years after

utstanding! that Uiere may be millions

of this British Federal institotkwv

The New York Herald of Friday,
peaking of exchange on the South and
lie indications of a general resumption,
ias the following remarks:
The rates of premium on specie indi:ate
the degree of depreciation of the lo:al
currencies throughout the South, and
he different degrees of indebtedness ?o
he commercial centre of the Union. It
vill be observed that the rate of bills on
England, being in deprecrialcd currencies,
ire generally lower than at this port, and -
ire in every instance below par for specie.
Whether the proposed resumption will
xtend to all these points or not, is yet
iroblemalical. Letters from New Orleans
ire confident that it cannot be effected
here. The resumption by the United
states Rank is a juggle, and will in all
irobability not last three months. New
)rleans is a commanding point, and the
>rnnrli of the United States Batik there
ind the Merchants Dank, exert as great
n influence as the mother bank does in
'hiladelphia. Popular opinion docs not
et so strongly in favor of resumption in
he former, as in the latter city. It is
herefofe feared that non-resumption in
lew Orleans will be made the cloak for
nother suspension at an early day, unless
tie deposit?# of the federal government
re restored the United States Dank. If
[lis cannot be effected, a new suspension
nd derangement of affairs, will make it
he instrument of new political intrigues.
