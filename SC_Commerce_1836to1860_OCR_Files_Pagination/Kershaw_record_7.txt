It is time that this unequal position of
M" lire should rca-o, and thai Legislative
J anion should be brought to sustain Exe[
miive * xertion in such measures as the
a .-> requires. While France persists in
hi r refusal to comply with the t rax of a
treaty, the object of which was, by removing
all causes of mutual complaint,
to renew ancient feelings of friendship,
and to unite the two nations ia the bunds
of amity, and of a mutually beneficial
commerce, she esnnot justly complain if
we adopt auch peaceful remedies as the
law of nations and the circumstances of
the case may authorize and demand. Ofj
the nature of these remedies, I have here-'
lofnre had occuainn to speak; and, in re-,
frmice lo particular contingency, to'
express mv conviction that reprisals would '
l-e beat adapted to the emergency th> n
contemplated. Since that period. France,
by all the departments of her Government,
has acknowledged the validity of
our claims, and the obligations of the
treaty, and has appropriated the moneys.
which are necessity to its execution; and
though payment is withhrld on grounds
vitally important to our existence as sn independent
nation, it is not to be believed
that she can have determined permanently
to retain a position ? utterly indefensible.
In the alterej state of the questions'
" * ?? ?J .11 *.i.f ina air.
io cooiroTemj, auu uuun ? ,
?BmiUDcr?, i( appears to me, that, until
such a determination shall have become i
erident, it will be proper and sufficient'
to retaliate her prraciit refusal to comply j
with ber engagements, by prohibiting1
the introduction of French products and '
4hc entry of French vessels into our ports. j
Between thia and the interdiction of all;

the former, in the present posture of our |
flairs, feeing the least injurious to our
commerce, and as attended with the least
difficulty of returning to the usual state
of friendly Intercourse, if the Government
of Prance shall render us the justice
that is due, and also as a proper preliminary
step to stronger measures, should
their adoption bs rendered necessary by
subsequent events.
The return of our Charge d*Affaires is
attended with public notices of naval preparation#
on the part of France, destined
for our seas. Of lha cause and intent of
three arms menu, 1 have no authentic information,
nor any other means of judging,
except such as are common to yourselves
and to the public; but whatever
may be their ohject, we are not at liberty
to regard them aa unconnected with the
measures which hostile movements on the.
part of France may compel us to pursue.

(lie Government of Great Britain between

controversy which unhappily exists between
the United States and France.
That the mediation will be accepted, if it
have Iweii ode red, we will not permit our*
tc.lvt-t to doubt. To do so, would be lo impute
to our Ministry a determination to force
a quarrel, and not with a view 10 either the
hooor or lotereai of the country, bo h df
which would undoubtedly be consulted by an
amicable term mil ion of the dispute. Every ,
Power, ssya the most popular writer on the
Law of Nations, in treating of mediation in
general, owes an much respect to the happiness
of human society, as to ap)?e<ir oprn to
every method of reconciliation, wb?-n it relates
to interests that are not essential. No
essential interest, certainly, is involved in the
dispute between ihe Untied States and France;
nothing which can be inflamed to a quarrel
unless there is a predetermination towards
that climax, if ever there was a caic in
which mediation, offered by a common friend
ought to be accepted by two nations, the j

MELANCHOLY OCCURRENCE
During the eicite nrnt on Tuesday lam, an
express arrived in town, informing the commander
at this place, that fire hundred armed
Indiana had crowed the rirer a few miles below
Columbus. A small dtdsehruonr, commanded
by Mr. John Wat**, was tmnje
diMdy dctpaichnd to U* ?pot I? ascertain
the particular*. When they arrived at Bryant^
ferry, 15 mile? from this place, they
learned that 40 or 50 Indians with rifles had
crossed that morning.?about noon tne Indiana
were discovered retiring towards the
ferry, and were pursued by the company, j
comprised of aliout 22 men, who had assem-i
bled during the day?only half of whom;
were armed. When the Indians di>covered '
them they fled to a ravine, from which they,
commenced a regular Are, which was
returned with spirit by iho little company.? j
During the action Mr. M'ttryde, and ,
, Mr. Josiah Johnson, both highly respectable |
young men of this ?ouniy were killed, and
Col. Anderson Spear, and one other gentleman
ser rely wou ided The whites were
compelled to quit the field in disorder,
leading their dead upon the ground?Mr.
Watson rcceired several balls through his
clothes, and others of the company had their!
hats pierced in several places. On Tuesday
night a volunteer company of 40 men, commanded
by Col. Bales, descended ihe river
on the Stem Boat Vena Calhoun, to the
place of action, and returned on Wednesday,!
bringing ihe I indie* of Mr Johnson and .Mr.!
M'Bryde, which were horridly mangled and j
brui-u-d br the savages, after the whites quit
the field.
The Indians had dispersed, and probably
returned to their homes when C d. Bath's
Company arrived at ihe" ferry, but so great
was the consternation ol the settlers thu 1
many of them had abandoned their farms to
seek a safe retreat at a distance from the
