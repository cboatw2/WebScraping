TO TilE EDGEFIELD BAPTIST
31INlSTERlALt CONFERENCE.
BELoa)VED BRETHREN:
In accordance with your request, I pre
sent to you this csay, on the following
query
. "Can a Member of a Clurd of Christ,
ConRistently, teidk his Profession, oten a
Tickat in a Lllery ?"
A lottery is a scheme formed by a body
of rational heings, in which the many
. must lose, and the few must gain, consi
derable suis of money. The gain and
the loss depend upon the turning of the
wheels, according to the principles of
chaued. In the prcess of the operation,
there is no room for the honest exercise of
the intellectual or moral powers. The
gain of the few is at the loss of the many,
without the return of the smallest equival
ent. This constitutes gamlbling; and as
all gambling is vrong, so is a lottery
wrong.
Il the discssion of this subject, I shall
first treat of gnaihling in general, and iben
apply the principles laid down, to the
lotterv scheme.
The indicatiors of the Divine Will, and
our duty, are given to us in the consil mioi
of things, and in the. written word of God.
The appetite of hunger points outt fhe ditty
of taking food - that of thirst, the dtty of
taking drink. So the posses-ion of intel
lectual faculties, whose proper food is
knowled!e, indicates the duty of usin2
them in acquiring infor iution. The
principles and objects of nature are tle
subjects in the investigation, in the riztht
application of which, these powers are to
be employed. The tesult ofsuch investiga
tion and application tenuds to the develoip
mnvat of human ener:y in the mosi ad
vantageous manner, and by necessary
coneonence to the benefit of natikind.
WVe possess moral powers that render
us capahle of being alied to God] ; the
existence of whi.h indicares the duly of
their iuaprovement iu those pursuits.
whicb will raise their posessor to tunior
with God, awd ptrepar~e him for pure anid
holy service lhere andl hereafter. .' To fear
God and keep his commandments: This
is the whole duty of tman."
In accordance withI this train of remark,
is t h: t ru th whieba is tan cht ihroo~thotit thc
Bible on this sttbjct. The parables of thme
-pounids andI thme talcents, ini conne.ionm with.
*- the above passage from Solomon, shall
:sufice, as illustrative of tils point, for mi
present purpose.
In the parable of the pofinds, a manti
represented as about to travel into a far
conmry. Before he departs, he comimit
to each of lisi servants omne pottnd, samying.
" Occuipy, till I conic." Int the para~Jc
of tho talents, the owner is representedl as
goinug to receive a kingdom, anid to returit.
Before lie sets ot, lie gives to each of his
servanmte, a dilferent amount of talents. On
the ret urn ,f each miaster, lie servatnts are
respectively catlled to give ini their account.
- Thme industrious are rewa rdeud. The
s'othiful are~ punmshed. By these parables
we arc evidently taught, that God has
~ivenl to all men ability and means to
serve IIlim ; rhat it is their dut~y to improve
what He has thuis given theta; that they,
who do so improve His gifts, shall be re'
warded-and that they, who do not, shall
* be p~unishmed.
Now, accordina to the +-ariety of talents
givenm to men. they engage in different puir
suits. Somne employ their tat!ents in the
professions of law, medicine, and science.
Others enigage in the businmess of imerchian
dize, agrieulture, and the inmucha arts.
in the re;:nlar adjustmtent ofi these v'ariouis
* ~ pursniis, the princilesC of science are car
ried out most profitably and hiapptily.Comn
modities oh different regionis are ex
'ehanged. Men of remote countries, and
of ddlerentcelimnes become neighbors. The
. improvemetnt of the tn.ore favomd is comt
nitnicated to the less polished ; anid its,
by graduail accessio~ns to the great interests
of otir race, its parts are being brought out
of their degradatin and ignorance, and
mankind is advanced to a lig a rank ini
the scale of creaionm. By :heo i a prove
mneuts elfected in the right emnpioymeint of
our various talents, the wayv is (opented ior
the progress of the Gospel ; and betnee. as
scmice and good goverinmentt :;ain grounid,
religion extendsi her borders The 'a- -ion
ary follows the tnavigator an'! the Ter
chantt. The man of science is not -lo e i(o
:be unmhtercd in the train. And thts in obe-,
dience to the constitution of things, and the.
written word of God, the earth is sub
dued-the clements of nature aro rendered
subservient to the operations ofmind-and
the genial influence of commerce, science,
and religion are shed lown upon the na
tions of the earth.
Let us now ingnire, if gambling has the
remotest tendency to carry iito efTeet the
will of God. titus plainly indicated in the
constutiion of things. and tle written
worI. The business of the gamller is to
emtploy himself at the card table, the faro
bank, or in some other schemne for the pur
pose of ivinning money. H is intellectual
energies are taxed to the uttermost in so
playing his part of the game, as to win
from his antagonist all the money that he
can. His intellectual effort tends to no
god I.1 does not enlarge his mind. It
fits him for noother employment.than that
of injiuring his fellow-men. The moral
energies of the gambler are made worse.
The second precept of :he Divine Law
commands us, to love our neighbour as
ourselves. Love worketh no ill to his
neighbor. Does the gambler obey this
law ? What love has lie to his neighbor,
who will win front Lim his last cent, and
reduce him and his family. if lie have one,
to a state of degraded poverty ? It is such
love as . vultures show to doves-tigers to
lambs." The gambler does nothing in the
line of his business tg cultivate the earth,
enlarge the boundaries of science, im
prove the arts, or advance the interests of
religion. The tendency of his pursuits is
to destroy all improvement, and render the
earth a waste-howling wilderness-to ha
nish all religion from lie minds of men,
ond the knawledge of God from the world.
Let us contemplate for a moment the
scene which the gambling table presents.
Behold the company assembled. Do they
begin their work wii It prayer ? They darTe
not invoke the blessing of God upon their
unholv doings. A deat h-like silence per
vales the assembly whilst the game pro
ceeds, uttil sone suien furn of luck
draws forth an exclamation of horror or of
joy, from the loser or the wintner, accom
panied with an awful oath. When the
game is ended, the successful party with
drawvs to count over in tritimph his ill
gotten gains. The utisuccessful party re
tires with confusion and remorse, to exe
crate his follv.
Alultiply such assemblies in the earth,
an:l % hat will lie lie result 1 Mankind
will be divb!ed into two classes-tlhe win
ners and the losers. But from the nature
of the case, the losers will form the lar:er
body, and the winners tle smaller. These
haieng engulphed all the porI.perty, tile
l"sers will becoine the abject vassals-the
degraded, servile victims of their covetous
destrovers.
Now, suppose the Great Master JsL<
CHntsr to come and reckon with these
his -rvants. WhIat account %ill they
have to render? What improvement will
they have made of the talents com mitted
to their charge ? Neither wvill have the
insulting pl'a to offer :-" I knew thee.
bhat thou art an hardl man, reaping where
thon hast not sown, and gathering wvhere
thou hiast not strewed; and I was afraid,
an oc i ent and hid thy talettt in lie earth.
Lo ! there thon hiast th it is thine"
Slothfulness ennot lie alleged against
tem. For they have bteen- indlustriously
engaged in. employing their talents-not
for good, but for evil. They cet not offer
tfese talents entire, though not improved,
that they mnight receive a better direchi- n,
but abused-pal lutedl-ruinied. What
miust I-e their dloom! If' the slothful ser
umot has that, wvhicha he bath, taken from
him~i, and himself cast out into ttter dark
tces, where there is wvailing andl gnashing
ot teeth-whtither, 0! whither, shall the
gambler he driveni ?
If the news juist presented of ennmbling
he cor' ct, can it lie consiste t with the
professionu of am Christiatn, that lie should
give cou-:tenan ' in atny form-even
in the shape a lottery, the most plausible
ormn which it can assume ? Surely not.
But let us take another ,i. w of g b
hong. It is sometimes urged in fatvor of
gambling, that it is a transaction, like a y
other among men. proceedinug upon fair
and honorable principles. The parties
agree to be govertned by set tled rules, and
established laws. The loser has nothing
to comp~lain of, as lhe knew before hanid
the ternts upon which lhe agreed to gamble.
All this wears a plausible aspect ; but let
us examiine it more minutely.
in the arrangemnents for gambling, each
prty "stakes up," as, it is called, thte
sutm for which it is agr ---d to play. But
let us ask, for what puarpose is this donie ?
Is it thle intetntion or wish of either party,
that what tio st mes u .should go over
from the wi:ner to the loser, as an equt
vlent for the loss he sustains ? On the
contrary, is it not the intention of each, in
staking up what is agtreed upon, to tletain
what is so statked, atnd to, add I. it what is
set up agaitnst it ; so as to become master of
the whole, without the sig.'st r '-n nera
tionoreluivalentto his antagnntigI In this
lies the true spirit of gambling. Here is
found u nder the specious form-of agreement,
fairness, and hotnorable dealiug, the enor
mnuns g :ilt of eu obling. Is this not the
vrv essence of covetousnes,, wvhic con
sists in desirinig whtat is atnother's, without
and in retaining more tian ought to be re
tained ? With all the plausible showing
of fairness in Cambling, does not its true
nature lie in this, that the gambler covets
and seeks to get the property of his neigh
bor without a fair considera ion-a just
equivalent ? Now this prominent feature
in gambling takes it out of the course of
the ordinary transactions of men, which
are setuled by mutual agreement. For in
such transactions angim, just aud honest
men, one man ofl'eis a sum of money for a
connodity or possession which his neigh
bor has, which suni is considered as an
equivalent for the article to be purchased.
Both parties are benefitted, or suppose
themselves benefitted by the exchange.
But nothinfg of this kind takes plice in
gambliung. No exchange is conteiplated.
No eqivalent is ihought of. Two men
stake up, each a thousand dollars, making
the sum of two thousand dollars. A card
is turned, or the dice are throw n, and it is
decided, that the two thousand shall be the
property of one of the parties. What has
the loser in exchauge for his proportion of
the sum staked ? What has the winner
done to gain this amount ? Is there fair
ness ?-is there honesty ?-is there bene
volence in such a transaction ? Is there
not covetousness itn the whole concern
covet,,utsness which is idolairy, and which
excludes fron the kingdom of Gud ?
It has beenu bupposed that there may be
honest and honorable gamblers. One,
supposed to be so by the community in
which he lived, said to a genlenan of that
comtunity :-- Sir, there can be no such
character as an honest or honorable gum.
bler. 11 is a mistake to supposc that
such a characer can crist."
I trust that it is anow detnrustrably evi
deut, that the very naurc and tenleticy of'
gambling is wrong, and des'rueive. That
it violates tle constitution of thitgs under
which we are placed, and the written laws
of' God. No form, therefore, which gamna
bling can assonte, is right, or should ie
conuteinncl. Bit the lottery sclicte
has obtained fiuvor in the eyes of good
oetn, professors of reli-iun, and even
Clergyuuen. Grave 6enators, and wise
Legislators have lenit their sanction to the
lottery system, by legislative enactments ;
and ihe erection and endowient of literary
institttiotns, anl places of worship, in ho
nor of the I loly One of Isruel, have been
promoted by the profits arisin; f'roun such
schemes.
Lei ns examine minutcly the principles
of these schenes. In (te organizalion of
;a lottery a givein amoint is to be raised.
For this purpose a number of' tickets are
sold at a stat ed price. The avails of these
tickets constitue the tfunds. Usually there
,are about two laks to a prize. Two
thirds of those who purchase the tickets
-are losers, whilst otc-third only gain. At
the titne appointed, tho nanagers have
two wheels constructed. To each hf'
these a box is attached, which is turied by
the wheel. Into one aox is put the tickets
ar their numbers. and into ahe ,.tlher the
lalnks and the prizes or their numbers.
The wheels -are turned. A number is
drawn from the box, containing the tickets
or thaeir numbers, and then from the box
cortainiug the Wdanks and prizes, another
ticket or number is drawn. if oppoSite
to the ntmberof'the ticket there is drawn a
blank, the owner of' tle ticket is a loser.
If a prize, the owner of' the ticket is a
gainer. This is the process. Now it is
eidetnt that thtere catn he nto beneficial
exercise of'thce inatellectual or mocral powers
ott the pcart ol'the mtaniagers,thte turners of'
tte wheel, or. the purchaser's of' the tickets.
The whtol' depienads tpon whfat we call
dicance. The patrties are altocethter wvin
nrs; or altogether losers. Thtere is no
beteficic'l exchange of' services or com mo
diies. The purcasers of tickets, as thosei
who ganmble with cards or (lice, or any
oher way, stake ttp the price of the ticket,
not that thecir amouantgo stcaked shall go as
nuit equtivalent for sotne valuabhlc commna
dity, but as the mneans of getting a larga'
sat'n, and what they stake up, too. Thtus
obtinintg, if' they succeed. the property oaf
others wit hoot e-quivcalent, atnd keeping
what they seemed willing to give for it.
Suppose thecre be nine thousand~ pesn
who purchase as uany tickets at St0 ca
ticket; this will ke the sum raised
890.000. There is one prize of' 895,000,
ano er of'$l10.000O, anothecr of' $5'.ti00, aud~
smaller prizes to thce amiount of S820,I000
more-thtis will- muake $60,000 to lie
drawn fby the putrchasers taf tickets, and
$30,000 will renmain f'or the lottery mnak
er.Now these 830o,000 arc a clear bass
to the lottery ticket purchasers ;and as the
proportiont 'of' tblanks to a pariz~e is about two
bluks to a prize, it is evident that ouit of'
the tine thjouscand persons, wvho purchase
the tickets, six thaousanad are lorsers. Not
only do these lose the time spetnt in thce
purchase of' the ticket, latt they lose the
time spent in their thoughats and imnagina
tions on their supposed gcain~s.
Nowv, let us sum utp the vain imagint
idgs, the foolish calenilations, that are in
dulged by thtese nine thousand piersons mt
reference to their chtances for winntina thte
highest prizes, all of which rmust he ati
utter loss to eight thotisamil nine htundred
and ninety-four of the nine thonsantd,
since there are hut four high prizes. But
still it may lie ur'ged, the literary institu

The owner of' the ticket may say, " I

EDGEFIELD C. 11
TiClaSDA', SEPTEMBER 5, 1839.
Military Encampmzent.-The eucamp
ment of olflicers at Shibley's, Edgefield
District, closed on the 31st uit. We are
informed, that there was a full muster of
the several regiments, and that there was
e fine display at the review. The compa
nies generally, were complimented by the
Governor, but that which was commanded
by Colonel Wi-fall, inas particularly dis
inguished by his Excellency, and Gene
ral lcDtuffic. A negro hoy was shot by a
sentinel during the night, but it is said that
the wound is not dangerous.
The editors of the Augusta Daily
News, alluding to our recent " splendid
present," say-- The editor of the Edge
field Advertiser is a lucky chap. The gals
have been sending him lots of goodies,
sutch as figs,grapes, plums, and peaches."
The editors then give us some good ad
vice in a delicate matter. They seem to
think that we are in high favor with inoe
young ladies. Would to heaven, that we
were! If the lovely sex elt as warm a re
gard towards us, as we do towards THlEM,
our lot would be happy. indeed ! But our
feelings will not permit us, to say any
more on thissubject.
Colonel Caughtitan, of Lexington, is
announced as a candidate. to fill the Con
gressional vacancy in Colonel Elmore's
District.
Vexalions.-Editors often complain if a
letter of business, with the postage not
paid, is sent to them. They are indig
i-ant, ira communication for which they
are taxed, is addressed to them. But
what words can express their vexation, if
they receive, though the mail, a letter of
advice, not paid fur by the giver ? We
find the following reasonable request on
this subject, in the JOurnal of Belles Lot
tres :-- We are obliged to any of our sub
scribers for any hints or advice given in
good feeling, but we must request them to
send their advice free of postage."
Death of Bishop Boicen.-The Charles
ton Mercury, of the 27th oh., announces the
death of the venerable Bishop Bowen, of

died, in Chat leston, on the 25th tlt., of the
disease under which he labored for many
years. Ile was for more than twentv
years,Rcctor of St. Michael's Church, and
lishop ofthe Diocess.
The editor of the South Carolinian re
cently set out for the North, in'order to
procure a power-press, as the , xtension of
his business requires it. A very pleasant
excursion this, truly ! Did our business
warraunt it, we would go to the North our
selves, for the same purpose; but we
mutst still toil on wit ,our old-fashioned
pare.3s, and hope for better titmes.
Mr. Espy.-Though this philosopher is
not a witty man hitmself, we fcelieve, I,. i

time. They are written in a- very plain,
unadorned style." Some year. ago. we
read in a Charleston lporrer, some letters
written by Eliza Wilkinson,during the Re

Mr. Clay in New York.-The New
York Express, a W hig pa per, gives a long
account of the reception of Mlr. Clay in thar
city. The Whigs paid high honoirs to the
distinguished Senator. On his arrival in
the city. crowds of people, on foot, on
horseback, in carts, andcarriages, greeted
him with a hearty welonme, and formed his
escort. They carried him to the Park,
where Mr. Dudley Selden addressed 3Mr.
Clay, and welcomed him, it is supposed, to
the city. Alir. Clay replied, it is said,
with great feeling and effect. lie ex
pressed his gratitude for the unexpected
hospitality lie had received, and compli
mented the State of New York, in a high
degree. le spoke of t.e President, and
the Va1 Burenites in no me asuied terms.
He spoke about a certain Imperial Chief,
who had issued hisfat at Ca-le Garden ;
co'mpa , ! the mo--rn Whiga to the good
old Whigs, of the Revolution, and erded,
as orator -nerally do. by talking " of the
duty of his party, in the defence of tiheir
principles, to die in the last ditch!" The
crowd, as might he supposed. threw or
their caps, and gave three hearty cheers.
Thus ended the great pageant in the city of
Gotham.

The Great Race a- ross the Atlantic.-It
is known to mauty of our readers, that the
steamters, the Btritis', Queen and the
Great W~estern, started from New York,
en, their last voyage, very nearly at the
satne time. Much has'been said about
their progfress acrows the ocean. There
can he very little dloubt that the officers of
these boats were runtiuy a race. We.
make the following extract on this sub
ject, from the Teimp ante Advocate:
We had remarked some (lays since, the
vartitus aiccotunts brouight into the p~orts of
New York and Charlestotn, by different
veesels which had met, or seen the Great
Westerni and British Queen. and had re
marked the itnterest that seemed to be
manifested ais to their relative positiotns to
each oilher, but we cottld not believe that
it was to lie a trial of speed across the A t
lantic. We feared that the captains of
th~ese boats felt a rivalry, and were dispo
sed to test their ,.peed, but little did we ex
hiect to see the Press in this cotuntry, espe
cially, itn douthi Carolina atnd Georgii. seek
ing to eixcite an interest in this murderous
rivalry of Boats, atnd hurraing for the
hioremiost. We mean not this rebuke for
the journal we have quoted alone, and we
hieg hitm to underst and it so; the papers are
teetming with it. And what are "e to ex
pect fromt the course the Press is taking in
this matter ? It is inflatming passions al
readly excited, itnducitng steam-hoat cap
tains to so prose t hat the speed ofitheir boats
is narrowly watched, and that they are es
titmated accordinig to their abi'ity to beat
other boats in a race. I n a little time an
explosioti will take place, the hulls of these
stately vessels will be shivered, and some
of our mlost honored atid valuable citizens,
with their wives anid little otnes, may be
seen clinging to a plaik in the broad At
latntic. hopeless and perishing. But oh!I
howv the ttune will be changed then-what
will the Press then teem with?1-This odhi
ous practice of R acing-Congress must do
somthing-thie Ca ptains ought to lbe hung
