Krra ving thus briefly touched at the causes
of our present embarrasmont,s let us
now look to the remedy. This is plain
and palpable. The triumph of Whig
principles, and tlie administration of the
Government by honest and capable men,
can alone give us relief. This is a truth we
would impress upon the honest men of
all parties. The people know that if John
Tyler had not proved a traitor to his political
friends, we should now have had an
old fashioned U. S. Bank in full operation;
Commerce, Agriculture, and Manufactures,
would have once more flourish^
ed; and in conseouence. the neoulo would
^Sfiavc compelled the General Government
come forward in support of the credit
gg|||^Lthe States. 11 is treachery has almost'
|^^^*?onsigncd us to the slaugh of Loco fo j
it remains for the peopts to
whether they will extricate
themselves anuTriT* Country from the deep
disgrace into which we have fallen, or
whether the curses and abominations of a
hard rnonicd Government and a pauper ,
population, are to be entailed upon U9 forever
by the triumph of our political opponents
in 1844.

European Agricultural Tour and Survey.
V . We invite attention to the article on the first
pase under the above title. Mr. Colman's re
ports of his Agricultural Snrvey of Massachusetts
are among the most valuable papers on tiie subject
of agriculture ever given to the public in this coun^
Jet. That his reports from Europe will i
calculable value to the country can b<^ <K>fioted by
no one who has read his Massach^^s reports and j
who knows any thing of E#<jf^pcan agriculture.?
Although the crop^^^*^,^ the climates, and
the laborers ofgjifc^ are all different from ours,
partjcidarh^g^^c southern states, still the general
P"^djl^vhich arc at the foundation of improvein
soils and crops aie the same in all coun^rxevssi
and climates. As intelligent agriculturist
cannot read a good report of a good system of general
agriculture in any part of the world without
profit.
We return o?r thanks to the Urn. Jonx Campbell
for sundty valuable public documents.
CONGRESS.
In the Senate the Oregon bill finally pas- ,
aed by a small majority. On the third inatant,
Mr. Berrien made a report from the
Judiciaty Committee on the bill of the House,
and a bill of the Senate to repeal the bank,
rupt act. The report recommends that the Senate
be indefinitely postponed ; and that the bill
from the House be so amended as not to repeal
the act, bat abolish the provision for voluntary
bankruptcy, and require the consent of a ma ority
of creditors to force a debtor to bankruptcy. On
the 6th Mr. Archer moved a reconsideration of the
the vote on the Oregon bill. The question of reconsideration
was postponed till tie next day. On
the same day the Senate took "p an Exchequer
hill on the tabic, and Mr. Tallfladge made a very
able speech on the subject o'thc currency.
On the 7th the motion t? reconsider the question
on the Oregon bill was taken up and lost, by a
vote of 24 to 24; not a majority for it. Had this
question and vote b#en on the passage of the bill
it would have beer lost.
On the seme d*y Mr. McDuffic submitted resolutions
in favor of adopting measures to revive the |,

prevent the accumulation of debts; also for modi. (
fying the tariff to a strictly revenue standard, and
retrenching expenses. On the next day, Mr.
Evans submitted a string of resolutions which he
said ho would move as an amendment to Mr. ' j
McD.'s when taken up. These declare that the !
principal causes which depressed the commerce of
the country were the want of a good currency, and
state repudiation; that the Federal Government ,
will not pay the stale debts but that the states '
themselves ought to do it. I
In tho House the navy bill is still under consid- ! i
eration, and nothing else of much importance. i
A very interesting scene was exhibited in the |
House of Representatives on the 7th. Mr. Sum. I
mere, of Va., presented to Congress in the name of j
Samuel T. Washington, a graqd nephew of
General Washington, the War-Sword of the General,
and a cane bequeathed by Dr. Franklin to i
General Washington. Mr. Summers accoinpa- |
nicd the presentation of these interesting relics of 1
the Revolution] and mementos of WASHINGTON
and FRANKLIN, with a few very appro*

Mr. Carey is now in Charleston lecturing on
Temperance.
We see in a Columbia paper an advertisement
offering for sale a quack nostrum on the rccom.
mendationof'two members of Congress from South
Carolina." The Hon. S. H. Bltler recommends
it as 44 highly valuable in colds, because" he certi.
fies 411 have experienced relief from it myself, add
I can safely recommend it as possessing great
healing powers." The Italics are so marked in
the certificate. The Hon. James Rogers adds:
441 have tried the above medicine, and concur entirely
in Mr. Butler's opinion."
Ne sutor ultra crepidam. If members of Congress
would confine the publication of their opinions
and certificates to the subject of national politics
and President-making?the one in which a large
proportion of them seem to feel the deepest interest,
and with which they are, generally, somewhat acquainted?they
would be less apt to fall into ludicrous
mistakes, than in making publications on
Therapeutics and Materia Mcdica. The only
44 healing" power in Therapeutics (known to those
who understand the subject) is the vis medicatrix
natuR-E. Suppose this power to be extinguished
in the animal body to which the 44 Life Preserver"
of 44 the two members of Congress from South
Carolina" is applied, and what wouid Dc the errect
produced by its "great healing powers"? The
language of the honorable gentlemen is about as
correct as it would be to sjieak of the propelling
power of the grease and blacklcad applied to a
wagon wheel. All intelligent physiologists know
that in healing processes in the animal economy,
medicines act only by removing obstacles out of
nature's way, or by aiding nature in removing or
overcoming them. The M healing" is done by
nature herself. If the Honorable 44 members of
Congress" apply to a physician a dozen times, and
he relieves them each time of their 44 colds," though
in all the successive instances, a change of syraptnrriR
rpoiiirps .*? nlianfrft or modification of treat
- -1 ? ??o- --
ment, they think nothing of it. Treating diseases
is his vocation^H^has studied it, understands it,
and thcjg|(^^^_^eds in it. But if they apply to
^ignorant empiric,?or what is more common, if
he applies to thein for permission to experiment
upon tnem, ana ins experiment tans, notmug ?s
said about it. But if his nostrum happens to suit
ihe particular variety and stage of " cold" from
which they suffer, they are in raptures that a fellow
so ignorant should know how to cure a cold,
and they give him an unqualified certificate of
their confidence in him, or rather, in his " medicine,"
as a general cold-curcr; and that without
reference to the variety or stage of tho cold?to
constitution or age?to climate or season?to the
effect upon the secretions, whether cutaneous, renal
or mucous?whatever may be the state of the
body, whether sthenic or asthenic?whether it suffers
from plethora or depletion?whether it needs
bleeding or stimulants, starving or stuffing?whatever
may have been the previous state of health?
whatever organ may be affected, however, and to
whatever extent; let the disease only be called " a
cold," and whatever the symptoms, this is " the
best medicine." Because the Honorable gentlemen
once "tried" travelling up the river from the
mouth of Potomac Creek, and thus they reached
Washington City, do they therefore infer that by
travelling up the river from Georgetown, Baltimore,
Philadelphia or Columbia, they will also
reach Washington City ? No. Why do they
not ? Because they understand the subject matter
of considcratkin, and know better. Wc repeat
the adage : Ne sutor ultra crepidam,
Wc mean no disrespect to the " two members of
Congress from South Carolina." Nor can the
most fastidious allege that there is any indelicacy
in the introduction of their names into our columns
in connection with this subject. They gave the
certificates (supposing them to be genuine) with
their names appended by themselves, evidently for
the purpose of being made public, and thereby
challenged public scrutiny.
The small pox is now prevailing 10 more or iu&a
extent in Boston and New Orleans, and one or
two small towns in Mississippi. It was stated in
the Columbia Chronicle two or three weeks since,
on the authority of a letter from Charleston, that
it existed also in that city.
We see advertised in the Georgetown Observer,
a negro man committed to the jail of Williams,
burg 44 who says his name is Jim, and that he belongs
to Ncal McBridc of Chesterfield District."
If the law requires nothing to be done to inform
the owners of runaway slaves taken up and committed
to jail, except to advertise in any paper which
the sheriff or jailor may select for that purpose, it
ought to be amended. It is the interest of sheriffs
or jailors to retain slaves a6 long as they can, because
their fees are thereby increased. It is therefore
their interest to select that paper for advertising
which the owner of a slave committed will be least
apt to see, or hear of. Not many sheriffs ox.jailors
would do so; yet the law ought not allow any to
do it.
The Naval Court Martial for the trial of Alex,
ander Slidell McKrszie and others, for alleged
murder on board the brig Somrrs, is in session in
the city of New York. Commander McKonzic
admitted the facts alleged, and plead r.ot guilty to
the charges, which arc murder, rppredion, illegal
rmnishment, and conduct unbecoming an officer.
It is probable that the trial will not occupy a shorter
time than the ( oi^rt oi Inquiry consumed in its
mvcsslig.it ions.

The following statement appeared in the Char,
leston Mercury of the 4th February, and was
overlooked by us at the time or we should have j
copied it sooner. Humbugs are so common in ^
f our day, and the public seem so easily gulled by ^
them, that every exposure of any of them calcula- ^
. J ted to impress the popular mind, ought to be as
(! extensively circulated as possible by the conducr
tors of newspapers.
THE SO-CALLED MERMAID. [ g
"We have examined the production recently ex- j c
? hibited at the Masonic Hall purporting to be 44 the j ^
' most wonderful curiosity in the world?the Mcr- s
I maid." \
This pretended wonder is formed by the artificial 1
union of two very distinct and widely separated t
species?an Ape and a Fish. 1
The form of the head?the presence of hands c
with flat nails, and the long canuie teem, prove c
that the upper part of this compound belongs to j,
, the order quadrumana or four handed animals,
which arc composed of many genera and species, ]
( that are usually called by the general name of t
( Monkeys. The presence of cheek pouches, which e
in this dried specimen arc thrust upwards on the a
i cheek bones, announce it to have been an inhab;!
tant of the old wdfM and not of the new, as no p
American Monkey lias as yet been discovered r
with these appendages. The specimen has been c
much distorted and disguised in the preparation; n
it appears, however, to be that of an African spc- v
cies, frequently seen in the managcries of the I7- c
nited States. h
The lower part is the tail, together with the skin p
of the body of a Fish of the order Malacopterygii e
Abdominalis of Cuvicr, which includes a large a
family of fishes whose rays are all soft, followed n
by a second one, small and adipose. 0
The method which has been adopted to impose p
this gross deception on the public, is the following. &
The body of a Monkey, (the Hips and lower ex-*' n
trcmities having been removed,) is inserted into ^
the skin of the Fish deprived of its head?the ver. f?
tebral column of the Monkey descending eight or q,
ten inches into the fish's skin. The termination a
of the fish skin upwards can be traced without t>
much difficulty round the body, resting on the Q|
skin of the Monkey which passes underneath. ti
This caricature of nature is rendered more ab- w
surd when we take into consideration that we fa
have here the whole of the chest of a Monkey and h;
the slun of the whole chest, abdomen and tail of p,
a Fish, giving to the animal two chests and two p,
abdomens. bi
Regarding as we do the exhibition of such a w
deformity, an injury to natural science?as calculatcd
to perpetuate on the minds of the igiiorant tr
an absurd fable, and to extort mo.icy from the
pi?Uc under false pretences, we feci it our duty
to expose this vile deception, and to denounce the a
man who exhibits it as an impostcr. d

Quere :?Is there no way by which im^jsters C(
like those who practise this trick upon a too crcd. ^
ulous public can be suitably punished? Lawyers, aI
we believe, have a way of bringing suit for the re- jgj
covery of money obtained by false pretences. If fe
a few hundred of those who paid their money for gt
a sight of this made Mermaid, were to bring suit
in this form against the exhibitor, the sum total of rc
the costs would amount to a very considerable tl
fine. c<

nostrums be punished by suits in this form, brought

The recent instances of swindling practiced by 171
some of the 44 sovereign" States of the Union, in
first contracting, and then refusing, or neglecting P'
to pay, large debts, and the swindling encouraged c'
by the Bankrupt Law of Congress, and practiced a<
by thousands upon thousands under that law, fur- W
nish an apology if not an excuse for language like a<
the following copied from the Montreal Gazette: ,r
w
14 Communities may become so corrupt as to
render it absolutely necessary for the welfare of ^
mankind that they should be punished with a jstrong
arm. A spirit of licentiousness and immo- ^
rality may have so affected a Government as to ^
convert its statesmen into mere sharpers, and the /
body of its people into pirates, forgers, swindlers cf
and robbers. Such a community and such a w
Government do we believe the United i^ates to be
at the present moment, and it becomes a very se- ja
rious question whether, after the recent examples
that have been afforded, Great Britain would not
. . W
be doing a service to the world and justice to hcr
own interests by taking a firm and decided 6tand
against the insolent pretensions and most dishonest ct
practices of that Republic."

44 From a 4 shrewd,' 4 calculating,'4 smart' na- ht
tion, they have gradually grown worse and worse T
till honesty has become a weakness, and the first M
| merchants in the land figure as forgers, felons, and sii
[ defaulters. Rome in its worst days never presented m
Nso loathsome a spectacle; and we do not hesitate to
to state it as our firm opinion that very little is re- ar
quired to render the American nation a nation of br
outlaws, whose hand is against every one and everv
against them, and the American flag a pirat^l
flag, supported by plunder an<! rapine,"

ADDRESS OF GOV. GAYLE.
" Mr. Clay?The citizens of Mobile have asigncd
me the grateful and pleasing duty of congratulating
you on your arrival in Alabama, and
?f assuring you of the unfeigned satisfaction your
risit affords them in bidding you welcome to our
hores. I represent the entire body of our citizens,
vho disdain, on this occasion, to be recognised
?y any party designations. Our municipal auhoritics,
our military companies, our scientific,
iterary and professional men, our farmers, mc:hanics
and merchants?all, sir, of every trade,
:alling and vocation, unite with one voice
n the offer of their cordi?f salutations, and in tcnlering
to you the hospitalities of this ancient city,
rtrrs, sir, is the spontaneous homage which an in.
clligent, discerning and virtuous community, arc
vcr ready to pay to great talents, to exalted worth,
,nd to eminent public services.
" Your connexion with public affairs embraces a
eriod of more than thirty years, and when it is retiembcred,
that during the time, you have been
ailed h> participate in the control and management
01 cYcry department of the public serice,
and that you ^ verted a marked and deisive
influence upon those grt*^ measures which
avc been proposed as proper to fix and i*,'ltle l!1?
olicy of the government, it is obvious, that the
vents of your life and the history of the republic
re so blended, that the pages which record the one
lust include the other. During yourlong, arduus,
and conspicuous career, it could not be elected,
that you would escape thd??c angry party
oJlisions which are inseparable from free g'oyernient.
Nor could it be supposed, that thft prcjuiccs
and passions which these collisions seldom
lil to excite, would exempt your conduct from
ccasional, unjust and illiberal criticism. But like
II bad feelings and passions, their duration has
een brief. They have vanished before the light
f truth, and given way to those sentiments of jusce
and liberality which the American people
ill always ultimately entertain towards their
uthful public servants. And now, sir, when you
ave withdrawn from the perplexities and cares of
ublic business, and sought in retirement the rease
so congenial to the evening of life, it cannot
Jt be gratifying to behold the cheerfulness with
hich your countrymen every where, and of ever
party, bear witness to your ardent and lofty p'aiotism
and to the purity and integrity of your potical
life.
44 We of Mobile, in an especial manncr^we you
debt of gratitude for your patriotic efforts in inucing
the government to wrest from the dominn
of the King of Spain this interesting section
"the Union. Those who were opposed to this
Ql.-were alarmed at, and deprecated the wrath
Great Britain, which they supposed would be
iused against US uy any unci icicuce wiui tuc icitories
of Spain, then her friend and ally. But
?it formed no part of your creed to take counsel
am the imaginary fears of the colossal power of
te mistress of the seas, you fearlessly and eloquentmaintained
our right to the possession of the
>untry, and demonstrated the policy and propric'
of subjecting it to our laws. Mobib was then
1 obscure village, a mere dependency of a Spanh
military post?you now behold it a city of exnsive
commerce, and the emporium of one of
ic larg*--t uiaidc States in the Union. For this,
r, and for all the obrtiugmshed services you have
tndered this great country, we teuJer yon our
tanks and gratitude, and again I bid you weljme,
thrice wclcomo to the State of Alabama."
We have not space for the cloqnent reply of Mr.
lay.
The two mates of the brig Poultney, of Baltimre,
attempted about the 25th November, to
lurdcr the captain and lake the vessel, which at
te time was on a voyage to South America. The
an seems to have l?cen badly concerted and worse
Th/> Gantain was knocked down late
;?i ?
t night, whilftt he was passing up the companion
ay, by one of the mates; the other mate iromedi?ly
went on de^k to prevent the crew from interfcrig,
by tilling them that the captain had a scuffle
ith the second mate and would certainly shoot
ly of thcra who might enter the cabin. Some
'them, however, did enter and save the captain's
fe. One of the mates is said to be from Charlesn,
and well educated. These facts arc slated
f the captain of a vessel which arrived in Boston
um Pernamhuco. The plot seems not to have been
immunicatcd to any of the crew. Those who
ould have McKcnzie convicted of murder for
tecuting Spcnccr and others for plotting a simir
cliinc, may derive some comfort from this. If
racy on boird American vessels is what they
ish, it would seem they arc likely to be gratified.
Since the above was put in type we have rc ived
the Charleston Courier of the 8th, in which
cfind the following paragraphs:
"Mutinv.?A letter from Havana says: 'We
ivc had a ' Somen Mutiny' ^n a small scale.?
lie brig Guam, of Boston. Sal.'.e, master, from
[obile for the former port, put in here two ?iays
rice, the crew having refused duty and^,0tte4 to
urder the Captain and Mate, and fvake the brig
??I he Isle of Pines' of court Three of them
c in irons and will be so-r/t home for trial?the
% will proceed on her voyage as soon as she ran
rocurc men, which at present arc rather scarce.'"
' Missing Vessel.?Schr. Abagail, of Provincciwn,
sailed from Turks Island, Sept. 28, deeply
iden with salt, for Norfolk, since which nothing
as been hcird of her. She also had on board a
uantity of specie. Captain Alexander Lossand
as master, aged 22 years; Mr. Samuel S. Snow,
s?t officer was 25 years old, and has left a wife;
ne of her seamen was Manuel Francis, aged 18.
'he above all belonged to Provincetown. She
ad two*other seamen, names aDd residences unnown."
The decision of the Court of Inquiry m the
'omers case has been published, and fully justifies
'ommandcr McKcnzic, to whom, and bis officers,
. awards high praise for their conduct the ocasion.
