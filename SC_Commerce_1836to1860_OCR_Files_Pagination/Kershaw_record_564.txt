from Yorkville and Spartanburgh C. II ,S.C..near
ihe road crossing Broad River at Gtuinn's Ferry,
upon a beautiful level ridge, free from mud, and only
one mile and a half from Wilsos's SULPHUR
SPRINGS.
The Subscribers are sure, that to those persons
desirous of procuring an agreeable and healthy residence,
no place could present greater advantages.
The situation is high, dry, and healthy. It is well
watered, near Broad River, and a thick settled
neighborhood. There are a large number of Saw
MiKs near, and every other convenience for bnil.
-i' ding, and Wilson's Springs only fifteen minutes ride
distant. Nothing is necessary to be said of the character
of those Springs. They are regarded as being
inferior to none in the Southern conntry, and
hundreds ot invalids can attesttheir healing propertics.
Within a hundred yards of the Wilson's
White Sulphur Springs, there is a red sulphur, and
"a Chalybeate Spring, and there are several other
Sulphur Springs in the immediate neigeborhood ol
Shelbv, though none equal to Wilson s for medicinnl
properties li is certain, too, that as soon as the
Town gels und-r way, the line of Stages, tri-weekly
and four horse coaches, from Raleigh to Ashville
and thence to Nashville, Tenn., and also from Spartanburgh
C. fl. to Lincolnton, will pass through,
affording every reasonable mail facility. In short,
nothing is wanting to make it one of the most delicrhtful
xnnts on earth, except?a plentiful supply
of good inhabitants, and we wish all auch to come
and buy.

bill making appropriations for the salaries and outfits rf
of diplomatic agents.
Mr. M'Kcon continued and concluded his speech
in favor ofconcurring with the Senate's amendment tci
striking out the item for a mission to Naples, insist. 0v
ing on the fact that the Neapolitan Governmont had th
no charge here, taking the general ground that vc a
ought to retain no permanent foreign missions uny ha
where. St
Mr. Cus'ning entered into a brief reply. \
Mr. Wise addressed the committee, observing that cu
lie should not do so had lie not feared that amidst Up
the excitement occasioned by the reception of the ye
Veto Message, the remarks of the gentlcmon from 0f
Massachusetts (Mr. Cushing) had not been heard or wt
attended to. rui
Mr. W. took substantially the same ground that J3t
Mr. Gushing had, going more fully into the details ROi
ns in r!ie extent and nature of our commerce with 0tl
Naples, the value and importance of a commercial 0tl
treaty to the interests of every part of the Union, and th<
the necessity, in the present aspect of our affairs, w|
having the eye of a diplomatic agent-kept on tho T1
movements of European powers, &c. We had a S0|
minister at the Sublime Porte, although the Sultan taj
kept none in his country. The same might be said an
of several of the South American Republics. We Up
were now the third commercial Power in the world, r,n
and our navigating interest ought to be cherished and no
fostered with the utmost sblicitudc. cd
M r. Adams complimented Mr. Wise on the zeal he SCj
had manifested, particularly as to the extension of do
our commercial relations. an
Mr. Stanley congratulated the gentleman from atl
Virginia (Mr. Wise) on the very prompt and patriotic 1
course lie had pursued on this occasion in favor of tal
the Neapolitan mission; but he must be malicious tin
enough to remind him of the very different cours-c he th(
had pursued, last session, in reference to the mission no
to Mexico, when he had moved to strike out tho
appropriations for a minister to that Government, or tin
to reduce it, and Mr. S had opposed the motion.
Mr. Wise here turned round and addressed to Mr. th<
Stanley a reply in explanation of his course the last pr
session, in which the Reporter understood him to no
say that lie had not moved to striko out the item for rei
a mission to Mexico, but only to reduce it from the
salary of a full minister to that of of a charge. He W
conciuuca oy ooserving inui uu kouiu nut uui. itgaiu mj
the mention of that circumstance, on the present oc- of
casion, as evincing some small degree of malcvo- ha
lcncc. mi
Mr. Stanley, in reply, said something of Mr. he
Wise's frequently manifesting, himself, a small ma. wl
levolenco, but m what Mr. S. had said he had owned C<
openly that there was a little malico aforethought, if 0f
the gentlemen pleased. It had been said by a gen- th
tlcman some time ago that he was suro a measure p:]
must be right bee iusc tho gentlemen from Massachu- ni
sctts(Mr. Adams) and the gentlemen from Virginia T
(Mr. Wise) were both opposed to it; the same remark ar
might now be turned the othor way, and it might be gS
said that this mission to Naples must bo right, since Co
both those gentlemen were in its f. vor. Mr. S. at;
should vote for this appropriation becuisc it was re. pi
commended by the Executive; although ho did not I
know whelhor he should horcaftcr support President sp
Tyler's administration or not; ho thought it not itnproboblo
he should go against it before long, bnt lie th
could not vote to strike this item from the bill when
both the gentlemen from Massachusetts and the 0t
frentlnmen from Virginia told him it was riirht. Ilis
t? " O - *3 position
was now for the first time in his life some- tc
what equivocal; but as long as he remained in it, he
would not vote against appropriating for a mission [C
approved by the President and by the venerable gen. Cy
tlcmen from Massachusetts, who was perfectly fa- m
miliar with all these matters, (and ho might almost br
say with every thing else in the world.) m
The gentlemen from New-York, he meant the gen- I
tlcmen from the city of New-York?he who went I
away for two or thrco weeks, and as soon as ho got ar
back talked on every subject boforc the House?that
one (Mr. M'Keon) had brought up the subject of nt
Mr. Enos T. Throop?a subject in regard to which of
a gentleman from Virginia (Mr Jones) had said pe
that Mr. S. referred to it last session at least twenty ed
fivo times. Well, it was true: Mr. S. had held it
up repeatedly as a reproach to the administration of th
Martin Van Buren; and he had so presented it at st:
home to his constituents. And that very case of
rewarding a man who had so grosly betrayed his \\
trust, was of itself enough politically to damn Mar- en
tin Van Buren and his administration to all eternity, sti
He wanted nomorctoprovcthat. than the investieating lei
Committee which had been made by the gentlemen w]
near him, (Mr. Dawson.) [Mr. S. here quoted the gi
report in reference to Mr. Throop's conduct stating wl
for a period of nine years he had utterly disregarded sa
the law prescribing the duties of his office and the X
orders of the Troasury Department, and had ren- in
dered the very object of his appointment nugatory; m
and that through his neglect Mr. Swartwout's dc. Bi]
falcation had gonq on accumulating for years.] iJw ov
, > ' &V&L':
t it be said that tliia was a mere exparte statement sa
ctated by party spirit, for it had received the sane- yo
on of an honorable gcntldman from Virginia, who
ood high in the same political party with Mr. Troop
mself and with the gentlemen from New-York, sei
ilr. M'Kcon.) an
Mr. S here quoted Mr. Ilopkin's endorsement of
e report. Yet, with this report, the truth of eve. an
word of which the gentlemen from New-York I '
ould not after this deny, staring him in the face, wl
[r. Van Burcn suffered this man td*rgvel in luxury
Naples, and for two j'ears to draw his ?4,500 out lul
the Treasury.
M r. S observed, in conclusion; that if John Tyler cd
ould veto a hundred bank bills, ho would excuse tre
tn on the ground of obeying his conscience; but if; Mi
could so far forget his duty, if he could so far th<
ten to the whisperings of a depraved ambition, as
keep an officer like this in an honorablo and lu- Co
ativc station, he would deserve the contempt and , lar
ccration of eveiy honest and hsnomblo man. Ho , ph
joiced to learn that this Enos T. Throop was to kn
recalled. coi
Mr. Fillmore said lie was informed that Mr. dis
hroopliad!>een recalled, and was on his way home. Ht
BREACH OF PRIVILEGE, to
Whilst Mr. Fillinorc was in the midst of a 6cn- pel
ace, the Reporter (who had noticed Mr. Wise cruss lay
er to the seat of Mr. Stanley, and had observed I
use-two gentlemen in a conversation apparently of agi
very excited character) saw Mr. Wise raise his j
nd violently and aim a blow at the face of Mr.' coi
anley, who as instantaneously met or returned it. coi
violent fight followed, and, in less time than it Co
n be described in this report, a scene of mingled thi
roar and fight, such as the Reporter, in many the
are' experience, has never witnessed on the floor Jeb
the House, ensued, Messrs. Wise and Stanley ; a r
xe lost to the sight of the Reporter in the general as
ih, whilst Mr. Arnold, of Tennessee, and Mr. j 1
itler, of Kentucky, wcro noticed in a violent per. cot
aal struggle, striding at and grappling with each'
ier. Mr. Dixon H. Lowis and Mr. Gihner, and log
icrs, were scon in the midst, endeavoring to quell mo
s disturbance, which had now reached u point ut J
lich it seemed impossible to arrest its progress.? bcr
le members had rushed from all parts of the flail, fes
ne rushing over and others standing upon the '
>les, literally piling- themselves one on the other, ion
d soveral canes were seen by the Reporter raised Stc
as if in the act of striking. The Speaker du- i
ig this time had resumed his Chair informally, but tab
0:10 paid the least regard to his voice, and he call. 1
in vain on the officers, none of whom wqre ob ved
by the Reporter, with the exception of the flc
or keeper, who was endeavoring to close the doors ' j
d windows against the crowd from without, who j
icinptcd to rush within the Hall. * wa
Tho general melee (of which the Reporter was
ring notes) continued froin two and a half to wa
ee minutes. It then subsided, as it appeared,
JUgh by what direct process the Reporter could vci
t understand; but he heard the voice of
Wise, who had returned to his seat, addressing '
; Chair.
[Tho Reporter thinks it proper to remark, that j
3 entire statement under tho head of "Bread) of ;
ivilcge" is given by hinjslf according to his own p
tes, and that no put of it has been submitted to
rision.] Jo
Something like order having been restored?Mr.
iso said he had risen for the purpose of apologiz- ^
v to tho House in the most humble manner, and ;
asking its pardon, as ho most sincerely did. He
d in its presence, under the excitement of the
oment, violated its order?an excitement which ^
could not repress. The House had witnessed ,,
uat had passed between the g^ntloman from North
irolina (Mr. Stanley) and himself, in the course w
the debate, and had heard the language used by '
at gentleman towards him. He (Mr. W.) hadi^
isscd over to that gentleman's seat, in ordor to re-1
onstratc with him in a friendly and private way. I
he gentleman from North-Carolina was excited, !
id he (Mr. W.) becoming bo, they wore soon en- j
iged in very hot words. Our friendly relations, gc
mtinued Mr. W., were interrupted. I will not
ite to the Hcuso circumstantially, all that took
ace; but he repeated to me what he had said, and n{
gave him warning that ho had not met me in the e(
irit in which I ar
Mr. W., at the close of the sentence which was 0|
us lost to the Reporter, was interrupted by
Mr. Andrews, of Kentucky, who said that he w
ijccted to the gentleman going into the facts,
hicli ho hoped would bo ascertained by a commit- flj
o nf nnrenne iuIiaIIv nn'intnrflStpH.
v. ?. vl
Mr. Wise. I liavo but a few words to say.? w
Jries of "Go on, goon."] In the warmth of my n,
icitemont I used harsh language, and the gentle.
an returned to me a word which I could not a,
ook, either hero or elsewhere. Never, whatever s|;
ay be the consequences, will I brook that word.? te
struck him. I liavo offended against the House; pt
humbly ask its pardon, and I submit myself to (jj
ly penalty which it may please to impose. ar]
Mr. Stanly then took the floor, and said he had |jj
>t risen to ask pardon of the House- If he had '1'
fended against it?if he had been guilty of any pj
malty the House might impose?even to be expell. ,?j]
!, or to be forced to resign. But (continued Mr. va
.) I believe I have done what any other man on iJl
is floor would have done under similar circum- sp
mces. all
The honorablo gcntloman from Virginia, (Mr. ra
risc,) whose insolence I will not say notorious, ac
mo round to my seat, not, as he says, to rcmon- by
rate?no, not to remonstrate?but to scold, to th
dure, to browbeat mo, as ho docs every body of
ho presumes to differ with such a high-born Vir- (r
nian as he is. I could not tolerate it. I told him pe
tiat I understood turn to nave saia, ana wnat x naa co
id in reply. He then said "I want to warn you." pc
o which I replied, "No, I will not take your warn- all
gP He then said, "Come out of tlie Hall with of
c," and started towards the door. I replied "No, a t
r; you have beard what I said; you can toko your of
vn ooursc; I have nothing more to say." He then pi;
id "You deserve ray contempt;" I then said, "Sir,
u are a liar."
Mr. Wise. That is not the fact.
Mr. Stanley. That is the state of facts, I as.
rt it before my constituents, before this House,
d before the world.
The gentleman then raised his hand and struck me;
d if the members of the House had not interfered.
vould have given him the severe punishment
iich lie deserves for his insolence.
Mr. Ingersoll rose and offered the following resoion:
Resolved, That a Special Committee be appointto
inuuiro into the circumstances of the rencoun
on the floor of the House between Mr. Wise and
r. Stanley, Members of this House, and to report
:reon to the Houso.
Mr. Andrews, of Kentucky, said that at the last
ngress a committee had been appointed on a simisubject
when a similar occurrence had taken
ice. How that investigation ended every body
ew. He was opposed to the appointment of a
mmittee. He considered the former occurrence
graceful to the House, as he considered this.?
thought that the two members engaged deserved
be expelled, and ho believed they should be exled
now, upon the spot, and without further de'Cries
in many parts of the House, "Agreed?
reed."]
rhero was no other way in which the House
rid vindicate its character and its dignity. The
nmittee appointed in a similar case at the last
ngrcss had done nothing?ha^ recommended nong?and
the indignity which had been offered io
i House and the country went unpunished and un^
ulrnrl T-Tn wttfi for nn onntmiffop__it ronnW fin
nerc white-washing affair?a mere humbug, such
we had heretofore had.
VIr. Hopkins (after a remark which the Reporter '
ild not hoar) moved the previous qnestion.
Mr. Andrews moved to lay the resolution of Mr. 1
rersoll on the tabic, with a view he said, if that
tion prevailed, to offer the following resolution:
Resolved, That the Hon. Henry A. Wise, a mem- J
of this House, having this day, by his own consions
on the floor of the House, while in session 1
Committee of the Whole on the slate of the Un,
committed an assault on the Hon. Edward
inley, be therefore expelled from the House.
Mr. Andrews moved to lay the resolution on the
ile, for the reasons above stated by him.
Which motion was rejected.
The question then recurred on the motion of Mr.
ipkins for the previous question.
And there was a second.
A.nd the main question (being on the resolution)
s ordered; and being tiken?
The resolution, by ayes 124, noes not counted,
s adopted.
And the committee was ordered to consist of se.
i members.
