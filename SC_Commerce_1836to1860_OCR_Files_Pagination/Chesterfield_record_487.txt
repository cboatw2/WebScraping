Washington, 25th Feb. 1041.
With the well known habits of Mr.
, Adam's family, it is not unreasonable to
presume that he left the house and furni.
i turc in good order, making an allowance
; for four ye ars' use ; how much that allow
anre should he every experienced liousej
ke eper will judge. Let us now sec w hat
. sums of money have liecn appropriated
for the purchase of furniture, sinco Gen.
Jackscn came into office, in 1829. It is
worthy of remark that these sums, when
j demanded, were always granted, with
j very little, sometimes with ho opposition,

March, 1837 granted Mr. Van Buren te
purchase furniture, 828,000
Mr. Van Buren having announced his
determination to quit the house on the
30th of February, the President.Elect
caused an enquiry to l>c made as to the
state of the furniture. What his astonishment
to hud, that there were not beds,
bedsteads, or bedding sufficient for his
' O
family; that the bed-rooms, with one or
two exceptions, were destitute of the requisite
articles of furniture. Other departments
of house-keeping are in similar
dilapidated situation. Thus circumstanced,
Gen. Harrison requested Col.
Chambers to have purchased whatever
furniture was necessary for the comfort of
his family, and if Congress could not pay
for it, lie ((Jen.) II. would.
When tne civil appropriation bill was
under consideration, yesterday, a motion
*.roa in inaort sir flume and dollars to
nuo ii|uuv iv ?MMV . ? ???- ? pay
for furniture for tbe President's
House. This was opposed by nearly every
Administration inerotar present, and
carried by a majority of only four votes.
It is proper to remark here, tlmt it has
been usual for the Committee Ways and
Means, to report the necessary sums for
the President's House ; but the Chairman,
Mr. Jones, of Virginia, not only omitted
to do this, but recorded his vote against
granting the amount required.
The House, to-day, took tip the Navy
Appropriation Bill, in Committee of the
Whole. Mr. Sul'onstall moved to increase
the appropriation from 81,425,000
to 83,000,000. A long debate took place
on this motion, and Mr. Mallory moved
to amend it by providing that 8300,000
of the cum be appropriated to the building
of steam vessels,
A man, whose general habits arc those
of sobriety and industry, but who unfortunately
will now and then indulge in the
intoxicating draught, came to the city
police ofiice th;s morning, and desired to
lie committed to prison for twenty-four
hours, with a view of being "brought ofFn
debauch." His application was granted.
