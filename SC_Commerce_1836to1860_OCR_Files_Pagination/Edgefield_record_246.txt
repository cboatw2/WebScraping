TO THE FIRST SPRING BIRD.
Blue Bird! o1 you let less tree,
Dlst thi: carol. thus to te,
"Spring is coming !-Spring is here!"
Sav'st thou so my birdliungdear'
What is that in Iisty shroud,
Stealing from the darken'd cloud?
Snow! - my friend!-it gathers round
Deeplv o'er the whiten'd ground.
Still iriou singest, blithe-amd clear,
"Spring is coming! -Spring is here !"
Strik'st thou not too lold a stain?
Wind& are piping o'er the plain,
Clouds are sweeping o'er the sky
With a lMack and tiret'ning, eye
Urchins, by the frozen rill,
Wrap thei- mantles closer still,
You poor man n ith donbtlet old,
Doth he shiver at the cold 7
Ilath he not the iose of blue?
Tell, me birdling, tell me true.
Spring's a maid of mirth and glee,
Rosy wreaths and revelry,
Ilast thou woo'd some winced love
To a nest in %erdaint -rove?
Sung to ier ofgreenood bower,
Sunny skies that unever lower?
Lur'd her with thy promise fir,
Or.a lot that knows no eare?
Prythee, bird, in coat of blue,
Though a lover-tell her true.
Ask her if. when storms are long,
She can sing a cheerful son
When the rude winds rock the tree.
Irshe'll closer cling to thee,
Then the blasts that sweep the sky
Unappalld siiall pass thee by,
Tho' thy cirtnin'd chamber show
Siftings of untimely snow,
Warm and glad thy heart shall be,
Love shall make it Spring for thee

MADAME AMERICA VESPUCCI.
This lady, it is well known, presented a
petition to Congress, asking two things
first, to be admitted to the rights of ciizon
ship in the United States, and, secondly, to
be given a "corner of land" out of the pub
lic domain of the country which hears the
name of 'ier ancestor. The committees
to whom her petition was referred, report
ed agaiust both applications,but on grounds
in no way personal to the petitioner. The
citizenship could not be granted, because,
under the Constitution of the U States,
Congress, can only make general and u
niform rules of naturalization, applicable
to all persons alike, and not to any one in
particular. The "corner ofland" could not
be granted, because there was no personal
service from the petitioner, for which it
could be a compensation.
In reporting against her applicationthe
Committee on Public Lands .lid ample
justice to the personal chara'ler of Mind
ame Vespucci, her intellectual and moral
qualities, her liberal principles, and her
descent from the celebrated Americus Ves
puccius; and recommended her to the A
merican people, for that asylum and es
tablishment which it was out of the power
of Congress to grant. The following are
extracts from the report :
"A descendant of Americus is now here;
a young, interesting, dignified and accom
plished ady, with a mind of the highest,
iellectual culture, and a heart beating
with all our own euthusiasm in the cause
of Americatn and of human liberty. She
feels that the name she hears is a prouder
title than earthly monarchs can bestow,
and she comes hero asking of us a small
corner of American soil,where she may pass
the remainder of her days in this the land
of her adoption. She conmes here as an
exile, separated forever from her friends
and family, a stranger, without a country
and without a home, expelled from her
naltive, Italy for the avowal and mainhe
- ntance of opinions favorable to free institu
tions, and an ardent desire for the es
tablishment of her country's freedom.
That she is indeed worthy of the name of
America-that her heart is indeed imbued
'with American principles anid a fervent
love of human liberty, is proved in her
case, by toils, and perils, and sacrifices,
worthy of tho prondest (lays of antiquity,
when the Roman and Spartan matront
were ever ready to surrender life itself in
their country's service."
* nImmediately after the rep~ort was read
ithe Senate, a national suibscriptiotn wvas
commenced for the henefit of Madame
Vespucci,- to be applied towvards proctring
.her a home and support in the U. States.
Senators from every quarter of the Union
-subscribed. The amount was received by
Mr. Hlaight. the Sergeant-at-arias of the
Senate, atnd preseted to her. Many oth
em placed in the hands ofME Haight other
sumsoto be .presented to her;, among whom
-we tiauve heard the itames of the Judges of
the Supreme Court, several members of
the llouse of Representatives, and some
c itizens, ..This is Lhe commencement of
the national subscription -recommended by
the report oft he committee on PublicLands,
*&wvhich,we presume,is now open to all cit
izens who, in the language of the report,
nity7 wish to aid in -procuring that home
*whiclh Madame Vespucci desires ainongst
us, and which Congress could not grant.

MY MOTHERt'S GRAVE.
I.remember vividly -the dir'tiumssteces
of her departure. Consumption had al
ready done its. powerful work. Unlike
neatty who are amitten with this disease,
she preferred to diemi the bosom of her
family. Why should the stag, pierced to
th?e beart in its own thicket, sleek refuge. iin
the deeper glades, to bleed todeath? It is
a wrong idea, this, of searching in a land
of strangers for health which is 'cleah
gone forever.' how many are thus year
ly cut down in their wanderings? In
some desolate chamber, they lie in the
agothies of death. N'o soft hand presses
their brow; -no familiar voice whispers in
ebn ear: no cherished friend performs their
funoral obsequies. Death is indeed bitter
under such circumstances, being without
its usual alleviations. - It is a sweet con
solation to die at home:
'On some fond breast the parting soul relies,
Some pious drops the closing eye requires;
Even from the tomb the voice of nature cries,
Even in our ashes live their wonted fires.'
There is something dreadful yet beauti
ful in consumption. It comes stealing on
so softly and] so silently. It comes, too,
in the garb of mockery and deception, and
clothes its victim in beautiful garments for
the grave. The hectic flush, the snowy
brow, the brilliant eye; who could believe
that these %%ere death's precursors. the sig
net of the conqueror! It invests The pa
tient with a preternatural patience and
sweetness under suffiering,keeping alive at
the same time, in her breast the illusion of
hope. Even in her moments of extreme
sulkring, she looks forward to days of re
turning happiness ; and while the worni
is forever preying at the core, and her
slender form becomes each (lay more fee
ble and attenuate, she hails before her a
gilded prospect, and the mind and spirits
are buoyant with the thought. But when
the final struggle has at last cornneced,
how sublime is the spectacle! To behold
the immortal mind so calm, so tranquil
and so triumphatt; waxing brighter and
brighter, while the tenement which con
tains it is but a poor fleshless skeleton; to
behold the eye beaming with undiminish
ed lustre toward the objects of its affection,
untii the soul at last bursting the charnel
vault which has too long confined it, takes
one triumphant bound. Then is the bodly
still and silent. The feather is unruiflied
by the breath, and the glass retains its pol
ish; for dust has returned to dust again,
and the spirit unto God who gave it.
It was a tempestuous night. The rain
poured down in torrents, The lighttning
gleamed luridly. At midnight I entered
the apatnent. A solitary taper gleamed
dismally on the hearth. The lorms of
those in the rooms appeared like gloomy
shadows, flitting to and fro. A stifled sob
and the ticking of a watch on the table
were the only sounds; and they struck like
a bearded arrow to my heart. I observed
her hand beckoning. 'Her head was rais
ed with pillows,a smile shot from her gla
zing eye. She essayed to speak. I bent
down my head with eagerness, to catch
the last whisperings of her voice. There
was a pause. She made signal to those
about her to repress their emotions.as they
valued her last legacy. The sobs ceased,
the groans were scarcely audible, and the
tears stood still upon the cheek of the
mourner. 'Ah! that is kind,' she began
in a voice as soft as music. Nature iust
have her course. The fountains of grief
were too full. They burst the barriers
which prudence would have fain erected,
and poured fourth in a torrent, sweeping
all before them. A cry, long, loud, and
piercing, filled the apartment. She cast
back a look of sorrowful reproach.
She arose in the couch. A paroxysm of
coughing seized her. She writhed for a
moment in convulsive agonies, and then
fell back' upon the pillow. A gleam of
lightuing, bright, dazzliag, appalling, shot
through the casement. She was DEAD!
*Let us pray,' exclaimed the reverend pas
tor; and with one accord the assembly
knell. while, at the noon of night, he of
fered up a fervent prayer. It was short,
but clothed in the poetic language of the
scriptures. It spoke of the silver cord be
ing loosed, and the golden bowl being
broken. It was finished, We arose from
our knees, cast one look at the emaniated
form of the departed, and left the apart
ment.
Fzasr DISCovE~RY or AMrEatcA.-The
Boston Mercantile Journal gives at summa
ry of Mr. S'nmh's Lecture on the claims
of the Northmen. The following extract
will be read with interest, as it intimates
the evidence on the subject.
Mr. S. commenced by alluding to pre-I
judices which all men naturally feel, in
favor of the truth of that which they have
been taught as true from their earliest in
fancy. This is applicable to the case of
Columbus's alleged disco very of A merica
in 1492. The truth of this, as the first
discovery of America, has been so long and
generally received, that it requires strong
evidence to show that the credit of first
discoverer does not belong to htitm. Mr. S.
proceeded fostate, however, that, although
it may have been generally unknowtn that
this country had been visited by Europe
ans before the time of Columbus, thme fact
had tnot been unknown to those wvho had
paid closer at tention to the subject. He
mentioned three separate works (and, sta
ted that many othters exist) which have
been published upwards of a century, in
Europe, in whtich the facts hauve been
mentioned. One oft hese was pritnted at
the Unaiversityof Oxford itn .171(j, so that
the accoutnt of these early discoveries is no'
new fangled theory as has-been represen
ted by sumec. Thle words of Adam. of
Bretmen, who lived and wrote in the 1ith
century and whose work (published in
1629) is well known,were quoted by Mr. S.
in wbich this country. its situation and
poduce, are distinctly mentioned and
the Danes or Northmen referred to as au
thorities. Mr. S, then alluded to the doe
utnmnts on this subject which have recent
ly been published by the Royal Society of
Northern Anat iquarians at Copenhagen.
Hie showed the ignorance of the actual
contents of these documents existing even
among.those who profess to have examin
ed them. stating-the fact of an -individual
of considerable eminence -in the literary
wvorld, having, asserted that ihe Northmnen
were accidentally driven to these coasts at
some time between the years 1000 and
1021, whereas they clearly show that these
coasts were first visited in the year 966,
and continued to be visited, not accidental
ly, hut for the express purpose of explora-'
tion and commerce from that date during
a period of nearly 100 years-that dwel
lings were erectedl here--stays of some
years- at diff'erent times made here-and
in all probability, more permanent colo
nies established, while the birth of one int
dividual (in the present State of Rhode
Island) particularized, whose descendants
are at this day ina4xistence, among whom
the well known sculptor, Thorwald-sen is
one. Mr. S, alluded to the character of
documents which establish the fact of these
early discoveries._ Theare of.. t.r k..s1.in
-firsi, manuscriptsof an age not long sub
sequent to the first alleged visit of the
Northmen, and of whose authenticity there
can be no doub; many of these are antece
dent in date to the later recorded visits of
the Northmen. Second, monuments re
maining in the countries thus visited, and
which were the handiwork of the North
men themselves.
Mr. S. proceeded to give an outline of
the narratives contained in these ancient
manuscripts, which, as those narratives
(being published only in the original Norse
dialect, with Danish and Latin transla
tiona,) must be inaccessible to the great
majority of those interested in the subject,
was peculiarly interesting. It would be
impossible to give even an abstract of these
details. It must suffice to say that this
country was first seen by Biarne Heriulf
son, in 986, and it was subsequently visi
ted for the express purpose of exploration,
by Leif and Thorwald, the sons of Eric
the Red, who had a few years previous
discovered and settled in Greenland. In
1007, Thornfinn Karlserue left Greenland
with 160 companions, (nine of whom, how
ever, soon returned wit b the express de
sign of forming a setiletent in ihiscountry
bringing with themt all kinds of live stock
for the purpose.-Though we are informed
of the return to Iceland of Thornfinn and
sonic of his companions, (not, however,
until after a residence here of upwards of
three years,) yet no account is given of
the return of the remainder; and it is prob
able that they formed a prominent settle
ment here, since an accour.t is ieven, in
other documetits, or the visit to this coun
try, called by the Northmen, Vinland, of
Dishop Eric, in 1121. which could hardly
have been made with any other purpose
thai that of perforning Episcopal offices
here.
Vinland, to which all these accounts re
fer, was the present Neo England. The
southern part of this couturv was likewise
visited by the Northern traders, and it -p
years that a constant intercourse was kept
up betwen that part anil Ireland. for a
long period. It was called Huilramanrna
land (White Mau's land.) or Great Ireland,
hecause the inhabitants were Whites and
supposed by the Northmen to be of Irish
origin.
