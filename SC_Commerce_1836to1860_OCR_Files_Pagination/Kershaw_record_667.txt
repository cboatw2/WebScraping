A Singular Memorial?A memorial to Congress
has been left at the Exchange in Philadel- j
phia, for signatures, in which it is proposed that f
a national stock of 3200,000,COO be created to | j.
"5 bear an interest that would place it at par, which) j
sum shall be divided among the several States & f
Territories by allotment. In order to secure full
confidence as an investment, it ifi recommended
that the proceeds of the public lands be pledged
for its redemption, and an increase of the Tariff n
vg. for the payment of the interest. 1

THE NAVY.
This portion of the public service has been the
subject of much animadversion in Congress during
the past week. The extraordinary appropriations
demanded by the Secretary for naval
expenditure, taken in connexion with the sudden
increase of officers, have aroused the attention
of Congress to what always?ought to have been
a matter of the deepest concern. This gretlt arm
of national defence ought always to be the peculiar
care of the national councils; because it is,through
it, principally, that the General Legisla- A
ture must perforin its great office of protection to
the Union. The S ates control, to a^great extent,
much cf the military ijnrcc of fbe Union?,
that which must always be its principal strength r
on shore?the militia. But the igfty is the peculiar
power through whicli" thev-Fedcral Gov- w
eminent manifests its grand 'Sttribute every- ci
where, in giving security to our commerce in
peace, as well as""in war?in protecting our cit^
ies from conflagration, and our shores from invasion.
In truth, the navy tsjk^niore efficient or- R
gan even in the diplot^^^jybe General Government.
Our Governt^OTta^seen abroad most
imposingly in its naval Equipment; and for all
these reasons, and because it is a force which
threatens no danger to the liberties* of the country,
nor tyrranny even to individual citizens, iti d
has ever been a favorite with the Americatf'peo
pie. It was, therefore, anxiously fostered by
ihe late Democratic.Administrations." ?fhe pay
iu the service was raised a featjeai* since, great- ci
Jy -above that of the British wavy; and the Democratic
party took pride, in this way, to give proof
to the navy and to the world that it appreciated
the gallantry which had so signally triumphed
over the naval prowess which claims the seas as
its right by conquest. The Democratic ^Administration
then in power not only approved, but
urged, this national liberality. Tho Globe ad- 81
vocated the measure in advance of the action o a
& Congress; and tiie increased pay, so far from be-' \
ing grudged by the people, xt*as hailed as an hon- p
orable tribute to those wKb deserved more than ]
*itQOney from their country. j c
The late manifestations in Congress show that, it
the popular sense will not, with all its partiality!
for the navy, tolerate a system which would
make it a sort of retreat for sinecurists. - The
great multiplication of officers recently?the
swarm of midshipmen just fastened upon it, without
a prospect of employment for those already
schooled for the service?has excited apprehension
that it was to be turned into a source of political
patronage; and thousands of loiterers,
wearing the insignia of the navy, thrown upon
the country,, to serve only as the partisans of
those who gave them pay without employment. s
Such a corps of idlers might serve to ?jng ho- ](
sannas to tLeir patrons, but could not$ail to t]
firing into disrespute that harddy, adventurous
navy, whose brave exploits had crowned it with
renown. ? -
The American people, over active and industrious,
cannoiybear to feel tiiat they provide for
- luxurious indolence out of their hard earnings.
They take the highest gratification in^'beeing j]
i&A our old commodores?whose bravery m bat-! n
jfe- tie, skill in tactics, invention, and steamships, j t]
p w* and exactness in discipline, have covered our. 0
flag with glory?enjoying, in their old age, ease,' <ti
affluence, atid dignity. They are willing to emp- i 8
ty their purses to see a hard career of glorious; a
patriotism closed in the midst of comforts andjp
honors, but they cannot bear to see the young; n
and healthy wasting their lives in riot or indo-'c
lence,. at the public expense; and this musf in- w
evitably be the case, when multitudes are't;
brought into a service where there is employment s
only for a few. tl
TfieDeaibcratic Administrations acted upon t;
the system of allowing the veterans totakesta- d
tioiis on shore, where their experience and chare n
acter would be most available in the preparation
of our ships, and the youngest officers, who were y
to command them, to fullil their destiny. It a
was a great object with both the late Adminis- d
trations to provide distant and useful service for J
our marine, that it might be constantly engaged j it
in the exercise of those faculties which must be | c
called to protect the nation in time of war.? fi
Hence the expedition wasHtted out Hence the it
chastisement of the Malays. Hence our trea- ti
ties with remote, and, until-then, unvisited na- t
tions, by our warlike ship. This was the true a
mode of keeping up the character andpopulari- e
ty of the navy. Mr. Bayard, who distinguished a
himself, during the late debate, ihy the zeal he c
expressed in its behalf, paid an honorable tribute f
a.~ i a. ? Tin 1_;? _
iu mo ptmiicui opponents, vvnen repiymg 10 p

as Secretary had bepn both wise and efficient I
Mr: Archer paid him'a still higher compliment, f<
when he said that Mr. Woodbury had a better o
knowledge of the service than the^jraegibers on a
e ther side of the chamber. T^us ex$ort^J*onj- e
v age to the information, wisdom, ancPSffi^jBn'cy of t:

APPORTIONMENT BILL.
The House, it will be seen, have given up
lieir own bill, and taken the Senate's ratio of
epresentalion. On the return of the bill from
lie Senate, the House voted a prompt rejection
f the Senate's measure, reducing the reprcscnition
below that of the last census, notwithianding
the great increase of population. But,
fter this demonstration, vindicating the great
rinciple and right of representation?insisting
hat the Representative should be brought as
lose as possible to the constituent, and that
L'ifh flip pvtpnsinn of sotllpd torritnrir. nnrl mill
iplication of people, the Representative body
hould be increased?the House yielded every
hingto the Senate; and yielded under the itnpuation
thrown upqn it by Senators, that it was
isorderly, andPincapable in proportion to its
umbers:
The public will, however, recollect that, ten
ears ago, the House was as large as it is now,
nd that no disorder or indecorums marked its
eliberations, until just before the close of Gen.
ackson's administration. The Bank then set
:s mercenaries, and the Abolitionists their inendiaries,
to work to mar the dignity and useulnessofthe
Representative body?to degrade
. in the eyes of the people. A few of these facious
and intriguing mal-contents have contrived
a distract the public councils, to waste the time,
nd defeat the order and properties of our greatstand
most popular legislative assembly, with
view to bring discredit on the democratic priniple
which lies at its foundation. It is to a handill
nl rnnRnimtnrB nnt tn t ho rrroat hnrlir e\( th*?

and disorganized condition of the people's
louse are to be attributed. Until within the
jur last years, the efficiency and respectability
f the representative body were never impaired
lthough the numbers were as great as at preset
No hour rules, no gags, no caucus dictaions,
interfered with the right of free discussion.

deliberation irnthe halls of Congress. And now
these people tgfce advantage of their own wrong,
to reduce the strength of the House in point-'ol
numbers, in proportion as they have brought
down its standing by their own shfitneful
ceedings.
But the reduction of the representation we
look upon as a minor affair, compared with the
great outrage upon principle perpetrated by the
mandates to .the States, to compel them to
change their mode of electing members. This
is the most high-handed act of Federal presumption
witnessed since the days of the elder Adams.

A few selections from a ncto book of Proverbs.
1. Nevor inquire thou of the editor for thd
new?, for behold it is his duty at the appointed
time to give it to thee withouLasking!
2. When thou dost write fqj his paper, never
say unto him 'what thinkest thou of my piece?'
for it may be the tru'h will offend thee.
3. It IS not fit that thou should'et ask of him,
who is the author of of any article, for his duty
requireth him to keep it to himself.
4. When thou dost enter a printing office, have
a care to thyself that thou dost not touch a type,
for thou mayest cause the printer much trouble.
fi. Look thou not at the copy which is in the
hands of the compositors; for 'tis not meet in the
I eyes of the printer.
6. Neither examine thou the proof sheet?for
it is not ready to meet thine eyes and thou mayest
not understand it.
7. Nor should'st thou, unless thou art a subscriber,
read the paper, whilst the pressman are
printing it off, but "wait until Subscribers are
served, when if there is a surplus, thou canst be
supplied gratis, but if none remain, thou can'st

A son of the Emerald Isle, who arrived at
New York the other day, was asked by an acquaintance
to take a glass of grog, but declined,
giving as a reason for his refusal, that he had
jotned the temperance society in Cork, before
leaving Ireland. His friend replied, that was
no consequence, as a pledge given in Ireland
was not binding here. To this piece of laftbanded
morality, Patrick indignantly retorted,
"Do ye suppose whin I brought ine body to
America, I'd beafther laving me 'sowl jn Ireland?"
