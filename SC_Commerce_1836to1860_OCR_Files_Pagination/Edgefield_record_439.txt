Conunue cations.
Mr. Editor:
By the communication of Col. Lewis
T. Wigfall, published in your paper of the
22d uit., it is nade to appear, that I have
uttered incorrect statements. in regard to
the adjustment of the recent difficulty be
tween that gentleman and myself. The
titisstatements imputed to me, I purpose
briefly and rapidly to dispose of, beginning
with those of least consequence.
1st. That Col. W. did speak of my ra
bcr, in terms of compliment and respect,
I have alfirmed, and do still aflirm, but
Messrs. Bacon and Gallman, are mistaken
in supposing that I stated that those re
marks were made to the Board of Refer
ees. The observation made by me. was,
that they were mado to "one of the Board."
The concluding portion of Mr. Bacon's
statement hereto subjoined, shows that he
is uncertain, whether I declared that Cot.
W.'s remarks were made to the Board, or
to one of them, and I am informed ttat
Mr. Gall-nan, a few days since, in conver
sation, declared that he laboured under
the same uncertainty.
2d. I certainly never could have intend
ed to assert that there wais no written set
tlement of the quarrel, between Col. V.
and myself. What motive could I ha .e
had for sayine that there was none? Up
on that adjutmenut, I relied for the vindi
cation of my honor, as nech as Col. Vig
fall could have done. Had I deemed it
Unsatisfictory, it wouldi never have have
been signed by my friend, Dr. Johnson.
Is it possible. to suppose that I would have
been guilty of an act of such drivelling
folly, as to assert, without motive 'or oh
ject, a glaring falsehood, certain to he de
tected in the course ort hree or four days at
the farthest! It is obvious, that a palpa
ble misapprehension existed onl the part of
Messrs. Gallman ai Biacoit. the tfortmer
of whom obtained from my Uncle, Col.
Carroll, a copy of the terms of ajustmeint,
within a very l'ew days after his conversa
tion with me. Both those gentlemen have
rendered me the jnstice, however, to ac
quit ine of all intentional mifsrepresen
tation, as Will appear by their statements
appended hereto. I cannot account for
the misapprehension whict: arose, unless
by sipposing that it resulted from my ro
plying. when aske.d for a copy of the termts
of adjuistmenr. '* that I had none," for in
conslequence of my inexperience in sneh
matters. I hat carelessly omitted to bring
with me a copy. That I ide not pre
tend to conceal from other persone, the
fact, that there was a written settlement, is
apparent f'rom the st Atementi of Captain
Bouham and Co!. Carroll, which will be
ftand helow.i
3d. I have ;tsserted, ,and do mnnintain,
that the ditrlientty hetween Col. Wigfall
and tyself, xts adjusted by his retracting
" C'very thin," or all otl'ensive language,
anil that in so doing, Col. W. did - ac
knowledge, ill the settlement, that he hail
pronounce.1 Mr. Glover to be a conard."
The "ol'eusive lanaage." used ly Col. I
W., which constitutel " ever) thing," that ,
was the immediate cause of the quarrel
between us, was his pronouncing me a
li:r, upon asserting t hat he had said to tie.
that Mr. Glover was a coward. lin the
settletment, it is in substanco stated, that
Col. WiLf'all. in pronotnncing me a liar,
supposed I hadl airtmed that Ie had mado
the ahove mentiined reiark concerning I
Mr. G., AFTER the reconciliation between
them. This, Col. W. denied having ever
done; but Col. W. was now apprised that
may assertion wvas, that he hatd made the
above remark cotncerning Mr. Glover, to
mec in Columbia. which proved to lbe DE~
FORE their reconciliation, andl this Cot.
W. admitted to be true: the epithet "liar"
was thterefore inapplicabile, and beinig the
result of misapprehension on the piurt of'
Col. WV.. was tberefore withdrawn. This,
though not all expressed in so many w~ords,
is the direct and itnevitable implication
arisinig fronm the terms of' the "settlemiet,"~
and from it there is no escape. Ia con-~
fimation of this, I refer to the subjoined
correspondence betweetn myaelf atnd the
gentlemen composinig the'iBuard, as also to
the following extract frotm the settlement,
SWe have ascertainedt that Mr. Brooks,
in the conversation wvith Mr. Glover, mn
which he statedl to him that Cot. Wigtfall
had spoken in unfrietidly :ermns of' him. had
reference, in poitnt of time, to a period an-,
tecedent to the reconciliation which had I
taken place between Col. Wigfall and
Mr. Glover;iiiid that Cot. WVigf-ul, itn ap
plying to Mr. Brooks, the epithet "liar,"i
supposed that Mr. Brooks' statemett had
reference to a point of time subisequent toI
that reconciliam ion. The origin and cause
of' the present difliculhy is this charge ofr
falsehood, andI it springs from, and is catised,
*by a total misapprehension as to time."1
- If the construction I have givent to tbe
"settlement" be correct, then I am thor-.
oughty justified in all I have saidl. By ac
ceptitng t he terms of adtjustment, submitted,
by the Board, Cot. Wigfall admitted theI
tiuth of the facts thereini set forth. if
they be untrue, his permitting them to passj
as true, was craven and dastardly : if they
be true, his attempting now to dotty themi,<
is despicable to the last degree.|
Had Col. W. allowed me an opportuni- I
ty of amnending anty injury I may have
done him, it would have been eagerly etm
braced by me. But no warninig, no op- I
portunity of explanation was allowed me. I
I knew nothing of' his alleged grievances I
until I read his publication itn this paper. I
In that publication, he insinuates that he<
"did nothing," and thtat the net'er pro
nounced Mr. Glover to be a coward, at 1
any time. As has been stated in the ad
justment, the cause of difficulty was an
imputation of falsehood, relative to this
statement. I requested him to meet me
in the mountains, in consequence of this
imputation. Four gentlemetn initerpose,j
and submit terms of "settlenmetut," in
which they say that "no itmputation" was1
left otn the character of' Mr. Brooks. This I
settlement was acceded oby Cot. Wigfall,
throtugh his friend, Capt. Gregg. It there.
by becatne his act. if this evidence is not
conclusive, that Cot. Wighall did protnuce
Mr, Glover to be a coward, I can proce
thathe did,
I am now willing for the community to
judge between us.

Maj. T. G. Bacon's Statement.
In the conversation I had with Mr. P. S.
Brooks, concerning the adjustment of the
difficulty between himself and Col. Wig
fall, (of which conversation I have given
Col. Wigfall a certificate,) I requested to
be shown a statement of that adjustment,
when a misunderstitding must have oc
curred, lbr I believe Mr. Brooks to be a
gentleman, and that he did not intend to
represent the aflir in an improper manner.
In justice to Mr. P. S. Brooks I iust
say I am not certain whether Mr. P. S
Brooks stated that Col. Wiagrall's remarks
concerning Mir. Whitfield Brooks, were
made in person. to one of the gentlemen
of the board, or to the whole.

In the conversation I had with Mr. P.

iculty between Col. Wigfall and himself,
I asked fir the settlenctt or instrument of
writing between them, I was under the
impression at the time, that he stated there
was none. Aithough under that impres
;ion still, since Mr. Brooks says that his
remark was that he had none, and not that
there was none, I am bound to believe it.
,s I think that Gentleman would not have
iade a false representation. In justice
o Mr. Brooks, I think nproper -i-te o t: a
I obtained a copy of the.adjustment from

tie charge made by Col. Wigraiil, against
Ilr. Brooks, of~ havinig stated what wans
ailse to Mr. G lover, was made unader a to
a! tmisaplprehenlsion of facts-under a mis
take. That of course, sutch a charge was

eft no impuatation of falsefhoud otn the

[Jnder the tmost solemn convictiona of its
