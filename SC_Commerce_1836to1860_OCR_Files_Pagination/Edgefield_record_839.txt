The protieditqs in the Dublin Court of
Queen'a Bench, i1 the case of the Queen
tjersus O'Connell and others, have closed
. with the despatch of. the writ of error to
London; it was allowed last.week, with
out opposition to ahe crown.
The authorities ot Richmond Penitenti
ary have put some restrictions- on the
wholesale admission ofvisitors: they are
tio longer allowed to inscribe their names
in a book tor publication; and deputations
to present addresses to Mr. O'Connell are
not admitted. The Freeman's Journal
notifies, that -these visitors, who wish to
have their names published, have only-to
leave a card at the office ofthe newspaper
for every one sent in to Mr. O'Connell.
Several meetings have.been held about
the country. One of the most respectable
was that at Belfast, on Friday; which
'coin prtsed "Liberals" of all shades. Some
'df the speakers avowed political differen
ces with Mr. O'Connell, but protested
against the prosecution as unjust.
The Dublin Corporation met on Thurs
day week last, to consider an address to
the Queen, on the subject of Mr. O'Con
nell's imprisonment; praying her to vin
dicate the constitution, and protect the
rights and liberties of her Majesty's sub
jects, which have been violated in his
person." An. address in that spirit was
proposed and advocated in several warm
speeches. Alderman Butt opposed it. The
address was carried, by 40 to 6.
The Repeal Association met on Mon
day. In taking the chair, Lord French
stated that he had come up to town for the
sole purpose of presenting the Liberator
and his fellow-martyrs with two addresses
from parishes in his county, the inhabitants
of which Here boiling with indignation at
Mr, O'Connell's unjust and unmerited
conviction, and had resolved, "come weal.
come wo." that on their parts there should
be no shrinking.
Mr. M'Nevin, a barrister, spoke of the
Emperor of Russia. whom he described as
brought over from Russia by the gaolers
of O'Connell, from his occupation of fet
ter-forging and peopling Siberia. to enjoy
a bear hugging with Prince Albert in a
lobby. Mr. Smith O'Brien read an address
from the Complete Suffrage Union of the
poople of England. signed 'Joseph Sturge,'
and expressing indignation at the impri
sonment of O'Connell. He mentioned a
rumor that government were about to is.
sue a proclamation to forbid the meeting
of the Association: the committee were
determined to try the legality of such a
proceeding; on the issue of the proclama
tion the Association would meet ; and he
requested to be chairman that day. The
rent for the week was ?3,200.
A government reporter continues to take
notes at tho Repeal meetings.
Sir Chas. Graham intimated that Wed
nesday the 26th, had been fixed for the re
ception of the deputation of the corporation
of Dublin, with the address to her Majes
ty, respecting the sentence of Mr. O'Con
nell and the other traversers.
Twenty-four hoys have been expelled
from the national schools in Dublin, be
cause they insisted upon wearing the re
peal hutton dluring school hours. The
pi-ohibition was confined to those hours
snerely, but the boys would not doff the
national emblem even durtmg that short
period.
Sir James Graham, itt reply to Mr. 0'
Brien's letter of remonstrance, says that.
by lawr, the enforcement of the discipline
of the Richmond Penitentiary is vested
in the board -of superintendence, which
board is not under the immediate control
of the Secretary of State, and that he is
not prepared to interfere with the discre

"The following, according to two pris
oners who escapied from the sabres of the
Chasseurs, is the, cause of. this sudden
change. A person allied to the Imperial

Bill to Amend thw Constitution.-This
bill, altering, the tenure of tbe office of

the advertisements on our first page. It
was ordered by the Legislature to be pub

for its rejection or confirmation. at the
next session, as they deem best; and we
therefore reccomniend it to their notice.
The errors in the signatures, of the Presi

the House of Representatives," and the
Speaker of tie House, as "President of the
Senate," we lattributed, in copying the
advertisements from the Mercury last week
to the printer, and corrected them; but
Mr, Arthur, the efficient and vigilant
Deputy Secretary of State, seeing this ap
praised us- that they were so copied from
the original certificate so the Bill in his
office, and that he had of course to certify
to that Bill and certificate as they are, and
the correction of the errors in the adver
tisement, rendered his certificate there in
correct. We therefore now publish. them
as they stand in the original; and the errors
of course originated from the document,
in a complete state, except the names, with
Speaker, &c. and President, &c., already
written under the blanks left for the names.
being inadvertently handed (as all the Acts
had just been) first to the President and
then to the Speaker instead of the reverse
as their official titles were written. No
blame can fairly attach to these errors, as
amid the hurry and confusion under which
such things are usually done, late at night.

South Carolinian.
By the late papers we learn, that there
has been a meeting held in Russell county,
Alabama, and resolutions adopted propo
sing a Southern Convention of the Slave
holding States, to assemble at Richmond,
Virginia, in October next, to consider what
course should be pursued, to meet the
present exigency of afrairs. Ir is high time
the South should begin to consider the
measures that should he taken to meet the
coming storm. But we do not feel alto
gether satisfied of the propriety of the time
specified for the meeting of that Conven
tion. If held before .fhe election for Presi
dent such measures may be adopted or
suggested as would irritate, and excite the
North, and he attended with sad conse
quences. We are for a Convention im
mediately after the Presidential election.
Our institutions have been assailed, the
21st rule abolished, and we may now ex
pect no quarters from Northern abolition
ists. We should prepare, then, to defend
and maintain them as they are, or die by
them; for without them, we cannot exist.
And can we be indifferent to the position
England has assumed on this question, or
the efforts .he is making under the false.
and deceitful guise of philanthropy, to
abolish slavery I Strange to say that there
are intelligent men in the South, who are
connected too with the institutions of sla
very, who are misled by party phrezy
so intent upon making Clay President
that they are lost to their own interests;
n-ir will they awake from their lethargy,
until the hand of the abolitionist is on thtetr
property. Look over many of the whig
prints of the day, and show us one if you
can, that admits that thte institution of sla
very ts in danger-though in the very
face of this, the .abolition party of the
North is daily gaining ground-andt Eng
land avows it her determination to be un
ceasing in her efforts, until slavery shall
be abolished all over the world. When
we cnnsider these facts, we say it is time

GENERAL JACKSON.
Every thing that relates to this old hero
and patriot, is interesting to the American
people. We cannot refrain, therefore
indeed we think it our dtuty-to lay before
the readerq of the Courier, an extract from
a letter written to his friettd and ancient
associate in arms, General PrLaucen, from
which it wdll 'be perceived that he is as
rr uch animated by love of country as he
was thirty years ago, when he expelled the
,British invaders from the soil of Louisiana.
We are happy and proud to hear the
setntiments of the General on the subject
of the Presidential election. and his pre
dictions of the result. No mnan in thte Union
has fuller or more accurate information
on that subject: and none is capable of
drawing a tnore correct conclusion from
facts. But here is the extract ?
"M -ermitage, June 14, 1844.
"yDear General-Texas in posses
sion of England, or under her influence,
and where would be the safety of our fron
tier from Indian depredation, and of the
South and WVest from a set-vile war -
Great Britain would organize an army on
the west bank of the Sabine, ihen declare
war, and in six day., with light troops,
seize Baton Rouge. Having tur-ned all
our fortifications..-New Orleans would fall;
and having command of the ocean, it
would cause a loss to us of fifty thousand
lives,-and millions of money to regaitn it.
."Texas is the' key to our safety from
Brttish linfluence and British invaion I
say accept her hand while sihe holds it ott
to as, and shut the door agaitnst all future
dan get-,'regardless of consequences.
NNo one could regret more than I did,
the pstitiotn in which my friend Mr. Van.
But-en placed himself bhy his leiteron .the
annexation of Texas. Had he come out
fortmmediste annexation, he would have
recetved the unanimous vote of the con
venhion as a candidate for the Pr-esidency,
and would have been elected by the-South
and West by, acclamation. Although I
reerset losing- Mr. V..B. and the cause, yet
I rejoice that the convention have made
epioice of those- worthy Democrats, Polk

~b6estsoection that could have been made;
theiiotall their political principles ; open
ithieir, opinions ; frank and firm in their
Aeaior the immuediate :apnexation of
Texas, around whom every Depocrat,
every true American and patriot can and
will rally, and none, I' trust, with more
alacrity than the brave Louisianian,,whose
firesides are not safe until Texas is annex
ed to our Union.
"Then let Polk, Dallas, a d Texas be.
the watchword and countersig--and Clay
and his friend Frelinghusen, the friend also
of abolitionism, for which he spurtis at
Texas, will lee overwhelmed by the unan
imous voice of the South.
"The resolution for the annexation of
Texas received the united votes of the
convention, and I have no doubt but that
they wiil receive the united voice of all
Louisianians, as their safety and happi
ness depend upon it.
" The nominations have received a
hearty response throughout the Union. I
think Polk and Dallas will get twenty
States, if not twenty-two, out of the 26.
Let Texas be the watchword and victory
is certain.

AN Un-PLEASANT AFFAIR.
Our readers will, probably, expect from
us an account of the "affair" between Mr.
John Tyler, Jun.. and a Hugh S. Plea
sants, said to be an associate editor of the
Richmond Whig. The cause of quarrel,
as will be recollected, was a reply to a
most infamous attack of the Whig upon
the President, in which reply Mr. Tyler
spoke in severe, but, merited terms of the
attacks which had been made upon his
father, and his family, and denounced the
author of those attacks, and especially the
last, in terms not to he misunderstood.
This note of Mr. Tyler's was dated the
23d of May, two days after the of'ensive
article appeared in the Whig. A month
was suffered to elapse bofore any notice of
the note was taken, as published in the
Enquirer, when Hugh R. Pleasants be
came the putative fattier, of the offensive
article, and sent a challenge to Mr. Tyler,
stipulating. as we understand, that North
Carolina should he the battle-ground, al
though Bladensburg, the Fort Woods, and
Old Point was suggested by the challenged
party.
On Sunday morning, the 30th ultimo,
Mr. Tyler arrived in Norfolk, and took
the boat to Old Point, coming up in the
evening, no suspicion of the object of his
visit being excited in the bosom of any
one. On Tuesday, following. however,
Pleasants arrived, and by his conduct at
the Car olfice, and the Crawford House.
soon aroused suspicion. He was . permit
ted to depart without an arrest, however,
and while in the Cars he requested the
Conductor to introdnce him by the name
of Hughes, which the Conductor did, but
which was almost immediately contra
dicted by Pleasants, himself, avowing that
he was one of the Editors of the Whig.
The meeting was fixed to take place on
the afternoon of the 4th instant. and at ihe
appointed time, Mr. 'y!er was on the
ground, but Mr. Pleasants had gone to
"parts unknown. We forbear making any
comments, being simply desirous that the
truth should be known. We understand
that the Second of Mr. Pleasants offered
to take the place of his absconded Princi
pal, and render that satisfaction which the
"laws of honor" always require in such
case, but Mr. Tyler declined such a meet
ing, having no cause' of quarrel with the
gentleman, he laving done all in his power
to bring his Principal to the aground, and
as no blame could be attached to the se
cond. cthose present seperated in friend
ship and good feeling. -
The Plood.-The steamer lirilliant
which arrived 'in Satuiday evening, re
ports that on Friday morning last the
Mississippi foreed its why through the
levee at the plantation of Stephen Van
Winkle. Esq, near the lowver mouth of
Fause River, and before it could be check
ed two ucres and a half were enrried away
and the place completely inudated. An
acre in depth was wvashied away, and the
water some three feet deep all over the
plantation-'-thus entirely running Mr. V
W's crop. The water runs with a swift
current into Fause River, and some fears
are entertained that that stream miay
overrun its banks and endanger the sur
rountding plantations. The levee between
the place of Mr. V. W. and Mr. James
Welsh, stil[- preserved all the planters
above the former from beiog overliowed.
By the Maria, we have accounts from
St Louis. to the evening of the 24th. when
the water wvas 384 feet above low water
mark, about eight feet higher than ever
before known. It was confidently believed
however that the floodl had spent itself,
and would speedily retire, as accounts had
been received that the wvaters above wvere
subsiding.
The Missouri is said to have broken into
the Mississippi at and below Portage des
Sioux, about eight miles above-Ahton; and
its yellow waters formed nearly a third of
tha whole volume of the river many miles
above its mouth. Opposite St. Lottie
the expanse of water was nine iniles in
width, covering the entire extent of'Ainer
ican bottom. The damage and loss sus
tained in all the country ubove the mouth
of the Ohio, by the loss of crops, the drown
ing of cattle and horses, the carrying uway
of fences and other improvements, and the
driving of the inhabitants in the lowlatid.
