Reprrsculatives of the United S.ates: '
We have continuted cause for expressite
our gratitude to the Supreme Ruler of the
Uoiverse for the benefits and blessings
which our country. utnder his kind Pisovi
4lence, has enjoyed during the past year.
Notwithstanding the exciting scenes ihro'
which we have passed. nothing has oc
curred to distturb the general peace, or
to derange tle harnonty of our political
system. The great tmoral spectacle has
been exhibited of a na1tnh. approximuia
ting in number to 20,000 000 titf Iople
having pierformed the high and irr portatt
function of electing their Chief Magistrate
for the term of four years. nithout the
commission of any act ofvitle ce. or the
manifestation of o spirit of insubordina.
tion to the laws... The great and intesti
inable right of suIrag. has been exercised
by all n ho were invested with i1. under
the lawo s of the difierent States, in a spiri
dictated alone by u desire. in the selerttoo
of the ag.ent, to advance the interests of
the country. and to place beyondjeapardy
the institutions.under which it is our hap
pines to live.,- That tle deepe-st itterest
has been manifested by all our country
men in the result of tie election, is no,I
less true than highly creditable to them.

f[ ny last Annual Message, I felt it to
be my duty to make known to Congress,
in terms both plain and emphatic, my
pinion in regard to tae war which tas so
Io e existed between Mexico and Texas;
which, since the battle (if San Jacinto, has
consisted altogether of predatory incur
sions- attended by circumstances revolting
to humanity. I repeat now, what 1 'hen
aid, that, after eight years of feeble and
tnefflctual efflorts to recover Texas. it was
'tme that the war should have ceased.
The United States had a direct interest in
he question.-The contiguity of the two
;tions toour territory was but too Wtell
:alcnlated to involve our peace. Unjust
mspiious were engendered in the mind of
tne or the other of the belligerents against

American interests were made to suffer.

:o persevere in the war, and no other
ilernative was left the Executive but ta
ake advantage of the well known dispo

qver into a treaty for annexing her territory
- that of the United States.
Since your last session, Mexico has
heateted to renew the war, ana has ei

sna it felt to tbe date, as well to itself, as to
hae honor otf the coumry. that a strong rep

en Goavernment upon the subject. Thais
was accordinigly done ; as will he seen by
Lthe copy of thte accompanying despatch
rromn the Secretarv of State to the United

was recognized by several of the leading
powers of the earth. She was free 'o

-free to take the cour.e which ihe belii

piness. Her Governaient and People de
cided on annexation to the U. Siates; and
tie Executive raw, in the acquisition-of
such a territorY, the means of advancing
their perman: nt happiness . and glory.
What principle of good faith then .was
violated? what rule of political morals
trampled under root? So far as Mexico
herself was concernedi tile measure should
have been regarded by her as highly bene
ficial. Her inability to reconquer Texas
had been exhibited, I repeat. by eight
not* nine-, ears of fruitless and ruinous
contest. In the meantime. Texas has
been grow ing in population and resources.
Emigretion has flowed into her :erritory,
from all parts of the word, in a curren
which contiones to increase in strength
Mexico requires a perisatent hoondary
between that young republic -tld herself.
Texas, at no distant day, if she continues
separate and detached from the United
States. will inevitably seek to consolidate
h r strength ty adding to her domain tie
contiguous provinces of Mexico. The
spiri nf revolt rrom the control of the
Central Government has. herett fodre, man
ifested itselfin some of those provinces;
and it is ''ir to infer that they would be in
elined to tatce the first favorable opportu
nity to proclaim their independence, -and
to form close alliances with Texas. The
war would thus be endless; or. ifcesoationq
of hoqtilittea should occur. they would only
endure for a season. The interests, of
Mexico, therefore, could in nothing be
better consulted than in a peace with her
neighbors. which would result in the es
talishiment of a parmenent boundary.
Upon the ratification of tite treaty, tlie Ex
ecutive was prepared to treat with her ont
the most liberal b-tsis. Hence the bouu
(aries of Texas were left undefined by the
treaty. The Executive proposed to settle
these upon terms that all the world should
havd pronounced Just and reasonable. No
tiegatiation upon that point could have
been undertaken between the United States
and Mexico. in advance nf the ratification
or the ireaty. We should have had no
right-no power-no authority to have
conducted such a negotiation; and to have
undertaken it would have been an assunp
tion eqatlly revolting to the pride of Mexi
en and Texas, and subjecting us to the
charge of arrogance; while to have propo
sed in advance of annexation, to satisfy
Mexico for any contingent interest she
might have in Texas. would have been to
have treated Texas not as an independent
power, bu-as a mere dependency of Mex
ico. This assumption could not have been
acted otn bv the Executive, without setting
at definnce your own solemn declaration
that that Republic was an independent
State. Mexico had. it is true, threatened
wa azainat the U. States, in the event the
treaty of atnexation was ratified. The
Executive could not permit itself to be
influenced by this threat. It represented
in this the spirit of our people, who are
ready to sacrifice much for peace. but no
thing to ittimidation. A war, under any
circumstances, is greatly to be depinred.
and the United States is the last nation to
desire it; but if. as the condition of petce,
it be required of un to forego the uiques
tionahle rigt tf treating with an indepen
dent power, of our owti ctilitient, upon
matters highly interesting to both, and that

with the whole world. the Ext-cutive does,
not hesitnte to say that the people of thtt

condititon. But no apprehension of war
was entertained by the Executive. and I
must express frankly the opinion. thai bad

wouldi have been followed by a prompt
settlement, to the entire satisfacetion of'

'Ot:her considerations of acoeditarlio"

wisilom of the future to determine. I

of annesatihn; and in that form it has bee
submitted ro the ordeal of public senti

most etmphatic. It is the will of both th
peopile and the States, that Texas shal
be annexed to the Union promptly an<
immediately . I., may be hoped that, C
carrying into execution the public will thu
declared, all collateral issues may h
avoided. Puture Legislatures can het
decide as to the number of States wbicI
should be formed out of the territory
when the time has . arrived, for decidin
that question. So with all ~others. B,
the treaty, the United States assumed th
paydent of the debts of T-%as. to an a
-mount not exceeding 810.000.000; to b
paid, with the acception of a-sum fallin
short of $400,000, exclusively out of th
proceeds of the sales of her pul iic liiods
We could not, with honor. take ihe larad
nvithout assuming the full payment of al
incumbrances upon thetn.
Nothing has occured since your las
session. to indu'ce a doubt that the dikpo-i
tions of Texas remain unaltered. No id
titnation ofan altered determination, on
the part ofher Government and People
has beer furnished to the Executive. Shi
btill desires to throw lierselfunder the pro
tection of our laws, and to partake of lh
Ilessings of our federative system; whil
eviry-American interest would see-n t,
require it. ' The' extension of our coas
wise and foreign trade,.. to -an amoun
almost inr lculable-the enlargement a
the m.trkef for our matiafactures-a- con
siantly growing market for our agricultu
ral productions-safety to our f.-ontiers
and addition strength and stability to thi
Union,-these are the results which woub
rapidly develope themselves, upon thi
consummation of the measure of annexa
lion. In such event. I will not doubt hu
that Mexico would find her true interes
to cottsisi ii, meeting the advances of thi
Government in a spirit of amity.
Nor do I apprehend any serious cam
plait from any other quarter; no sufficien
ground exists for such cornplaint. W
