8nd somewhat sceptical on the subject.
I have seen nothing for a long time which
promises sn.-ntich as the late discovery ofAf.
Bonuhorie in France; and nothing out of
which Yankees will be so likely to draw
profit for themselves and their country.
Jt may be hoped, that this discovery will
be widely circulated.
Wood is one of the great staples in
New-England; its value has been hereto,
fore increased, onlv bv mechanical skill;
but now, by the aid of a man of true science,
its value, its durability and its application,
are likely to be extended far
beyond anv farmer conception. Mr.
Boucherie's discovery, although resting on
sciehoe, is so simpleand plain, that those
least conversant with the philosophy of
vegetation will understand it at once, and
be convinced of its truth. It is well
known, that various experiments have
been tried to render wood more durable, and
even incombustible, impregnating it wiin
common salt, or metalic salts. But the
difficult has been, to so impregnate dry
wood Mr. Bnnchiere has avoided that
difficulty, by penetrating the wood while
yet alive. He says, " Lot a tree be cut
olTat the foot, and that foot placed in a
vessel containing the conversative liquor,
with which vou would saturate it, and
then the aspiratorv effect of the leaves will
cause this liquor to ascend with the sap.?
" Or that the tree may he notched, or partly
sawed in two; or it may be felled,
even leaving a tuff t)f leaves sufficient to
perform the aspiration upwards, and the
liquor will pervade the smallest twigs, and
even the leaves."
Thus much for the preservation of the
wood from dry or wet rot; a matter ot'
sufficient importance in itself, for ship
building, and other constructions?posts
railways1 <Stc. He then informs us, that
coloring matter of any hue, or variety
may be introduced into the wood, by the
same simple, and natural process.
For the preservation of the wood, he
recomnw nds Pyrolignite of Iron, or what
lie calls (he mother waters of salt marshes.
Hut you, Mr. Editor, will probahlv publish
at some other time extracts from the
report which has been made to the Academy
of Sciences in Paris, by the Commission
appointed to that effect. I will
therefore refer your readers to that document
; and conclude by some remarks of
mv own, tending to confirm the theory.
It is well known to farmers, and gardeners,
that salt, put round the roots of a
living tree will kill it, salt in large quantities
is poison for a tree, and it is absorbed
bv the same process as the sap is. and
with it; as poison is taken into the blood
offive animals, although it cannot penetrate
the veins of a dead body, l>ecause there
1 A. * A. t ! A ?.
is no circulation ; tne respiratory ai-uui^
of the lungs is wanting to make the blood
circulate. Now the leaves are the?res.
piratdry organs oT the plant, and it must
have sotne life to absorb any thing.
The tree is pervaded in all its parts
vi h small elongated cells, which communicate
with each other, through a narrow
passage in which there is, perhaps,
an invisible valve, or some alternate construction,
and expansion doing the office
of a valve. Through this passage the sap
rises from cell to cell, till it reaches the
leaves?or the lungs of the plant, and
tlien descends after undergoing a change;
as the blood is changed; after passing
'down through tlie arteries, and returning
bv the veins. Much siicculation might
* he had on the posdble action on these
Cells by liie nioiion produced bv thd wind
on the boughs of trees, an i this might "be
called the necessary exercise of the plant.
Here is a mechanicslaciion, which may
1)0 supposed to aid the ascent of the sap.
The heat of the sun may also facilitate
this operation, bv expanding the fluid
when it arrives to the twigs, and leaves.
# * ' ? * jI- A- I X
where il is tno*t expnseu ro mat near:
and thus producing a partial vacum, which
of lis* If is enough to cause the fluid below
to rise Eut it is not iriv intention to indulge
in speculations on vegetable physiology
; I will therefore recommend that experiments
be tried on some of our forest
trees, of different ages, the canting season,
with common salt, pyrolignious salt, and
with coloring matter. I would propose to
t?ore holes all around the trees as deep as
to the heart, for the sap docs not circulate
in the heart. Bore these holes inclining
downwards, then make a trough of soft clay
round the tree just below the holes, and
fill it with liquid which you have chosen,
and continue to till it so long as the tree
absorbs it. or dies, as it probably will soon.
J: may then ie cut down and put to use.
As snit marshes are not to be found in
everyplace where it may be desirable to
try this experiment, I w ould recommend,
to take the stagnant water, after a dry
time, from a peat hog, and add to it com.
"ion salt. Also take some of the same
water and add to it common salt.?
Also take some of the same water
?nd add to it iron. This last process
will color as well as harden the
?. wood, but the coloring ruRyhe varied at
pleasure with various ingredients. Our
forest beach is a very close grain wood,

' would he higher still, and some of our
.softer woods may thus be rendered more
valuable.
For chair, and cabinet work this discovery
is highly important, for the wood
may be put into use as soon as it is cut
down, and will be all the easier to work,
especially under the saw, or lathe. We
are informed by Mr. Boneherie, that wood
thus prepared, preserves its flexibility, is
not subject to cracks, flaws, or to warp.
About thirty yetrs ago, Captain Foreman.
of New-York, informed a friend of
the writer, that it became necessary to
build in great haste, a yessel in some place
where vessels were notorious for not lasting
sound more than aeven or eighty
ypsum, a ad there was no timber then to he
bad but that in the forest, then in leaf.
The timber was cut, and the vessel built,
und sailed on the siocks. Fifteen years
after, this vessel, supposed to be unsound,
was examined and found to be entirely
free from rot: Thus was it discovered in
' necerica, so long ago, that the sap was a
j Amessary conductor for any foreign con!
servative substance into wood. This
process was much less perfect, and expeditions
than that of Mr. Bonchiere, but. in
more scientific hands it ini^ht then iiave
led to the some results. The last process '
on green timber, is somewhat like that of j
tanning leather; the dry hide will not take !
O 1 J
the pyroligneous solution of the tannin,
until the celullar texture of the hide is
expanded by soaking, and gelatine is in a
situation to combine with the new alteraterative
substance, and thus form a new
compound.

THE NAVY.
I t # ^ 1
| It is the universal impression, and it
I cannot he doubted, that, in the efficiency j
of our Navy, as compared with those of j
other countries, we have receded rather]
than advanced, for the last twelve or
teen years. In th? adoption and prac'ice
of the modern improvements in naval
warfare, we are far behind the science of
age,?and very far in the roar of England,
France, Russia, and even smaller powers,
i When we came into conflict with Eng.
j land on the o^ean, during the last war, il
i was under advantages of which modern
t
I improvements in the art of naval warfare
. have in a great measure deprived us. Her |
j favorite class of ships, armed, as they i
I confess, with what they had supposed to j
j bo the most efficient calibre, we opposed
with a heavier calibre, *?ud an equal, and |
| in some respects superior degree of seaI
manship. Our success in these engage.
] inents was therefore, in general, all that j
we could desire. The English have, in
! consideration of these facts, adopted a
! much heavier and greatly improved ar- j
! rnament, as we shall presently show.
The overwhelming superiority of Eng.
' 1 " 1 1 .??? ?/! tur Afiipr i
>' land can oniv oe eut-uumcn-.u ?. f
f powers, by changes .and improvements
j which shall completely revolutionize.the
: art of naval warfare. The French saw
! this, even in the time of Napoleon, who
| was one of tlie first, according to Mr.
Paixhans, who struck the great idea of!
producing and applying a species of artil- !
lery that no ship of the line, (which is, \
after all, a frail edifice of wood,) can re- I
sist. ,
. Within the last ten years, the ideas of
Mr. Paixhans have been adopted in the
French and English service, and these
two nations have vied with each other in
! giving the fullest scope to those new npj
plications of science, the shock of which
J is, ere long, to bo felt throughout the
| world, and which are destined, it may be,
! to put an end to the despotism of England
J over the sea.
It is found that, without increasing the
I weight of the guns, or the difficulty of
I managing them, hollow projectiles of heavy
j calibre can be fired with terrific effect,
, and Bomb cannon of tremendous size may
1 - A I l
i l>e used on shtp-boara, so ns 10 hi row n j
| large bomb horizontally with as sure an j
aim as th6 solid shot from an ordinary
j cannon. Large bomf^ even of the calibre
| of one hundred and fifty or two hundred
1 pounds, are fired on ship-board, or from
j stationary batteries, with the force and
I p/ecision of a cannon ball. No struc- j
lures either of stone or wood can resist j
such artillery. The terrible efficiency of j
this arm (the Paxihans cannon,) was wit. i
nessed at Beyroot, St. Joan L> Acre, and ,
! at San Juan de Ulloa. Mr. Paixhans. in j
; his work on "new maritime artiHc; v,v '
; says, in regard to the destructive effects .
j of tliose bombs on vessels,?,4\V lieu thrown I
! horizontally, they will crush, strike to j
> pieces, and tear open, the side of the vos. j
stl, with a terrible shock. If tbev re.
main in the side their explosion, acting
like a mine, will open large breaches, the
J irregular fractures of which, extending
below the water line, will make a passage,
j through which the water will rush in, as
though a dyke were suddenly broken. If
a bomb should enter a a mast, it will overturn,
it, together with its yards, top and
i rigging. Should the hornh pass entirely
j through the ship's side, then they will
j produce their effects between decks, in
the midst of the combatants, thcartiherv
land munitions; and they will scatter
; around showers of iron, and insupportable
j volumes of smoke and flame; they will
'completely destroy s fabriek of wood,
i much more easily than one of stone; they
' will rip up the deck, set evcrv thing on
! fire, and cause dreadful ravages every
j where."
I As if all this was not enough, each
! bomb contains a German composition o?
i the attractive name of Dampjkugeln,
used to poison the galleries of mines, and
as an able reviewer of this subject tells
us, is "truly a pestilent congregation of
, vapors," rendering a ship uninhabitable.
It is enough to damp the ardor of the
loftiest chivalry to contemplate this last
"nouveUc armeand noth rg can be bet.
ter calculated to bring war into disrepute.
In truth, however, all improvements in
the art of war lesson its destructiveness
and frequency.
It being ascertained that there was no
more difficulty in carrying or fighting a
battery of bomb cannon than any other,
i the next step was, to connect this new
1 armament with Steam navigation. That
, it will answer as m ell for a cruize as for
coast defence, is the opinion of many
scientific men, and has been partially test.
! ed by experience. Its applicability to
! attacks on fortified places has been suffi.
I ciently tested; and for sea coast defence
1 it can have no parallel in efficiency, or in
| economy. It is peculiarly well adapted,
in this respect, to our service, and it has,
in some degree, forced itself upon the at.
tention of our government.
Capt. Ross, in his work on steam de.
fence, says, 'the destiny of Grid Britain
may be involved in this invention."? t
* * * "The system will, in fact, be- c
come a species of military, instead of a na s
val one; and they who should have been c
sailors, will be maritime soldiers, not seamen;
and then will our superiority, as far t
as depends on seamanship, disappear; or t
we shall become what they will be, and 1
must learn to meet them on our own <
cb?r.no!, a ) ! on oflr shores, as we met i
them :?l Vii:??ria. and Waterloo."
If s ;se:ior of seamanship, in I
comparison will, Prance and other Euro- i
peau !?"> ? r- is '? become of noavailun- )
der tiie n< w sys.em, so will our superiority I
in this , res;.( ct, become equally useless.
If the immense number of her seamen?
100 000 men?gives her a sort of advan- i
tage, how soon will she lose it, when any
[ landsman can, in a short time, be drilled to j
the management of artillery, in a floating
| steam battery I We shall also lose the |
benefit of the best race of seamen in the j
j world?the men bred in our fisheries and ,
coasting and foreign trade. But we shall
! gain in another respect?the resources of
j the interior river navigation will give us. ,
thousands of hardy and daring men. whe j
[ arc accustomed to service in steam ves- (
! sels, though they would be out of their
element in an ordinary sailing vessel? ,
Steam flotillas armed with Paixhans guns'1
or the Stephens gun. should it be prefered,
i throwing explosive shot of heavy calibre,
arc obviously the best means of defending
j our coast and preserving our cities from
' fire and pillage. No fleet, of whatever ,
I force, of the old kind, could maintain a
position on our coast, or blockade our
ports, if wc were thus prepared. But
suppose England, or any other naval pow.
er, assails us with steam fleets, then there
is the greatest reason why we should meet
1 fttir fnrfifir'a. f
them in me samu mamifi.
tions will be almost useless, unless armed
with bomb cannon, so that4thev may suf.
j ficientlv resist the approach of a hostile
'steam fleet In poinjt of economy, the
steam flotilla will have a grand advantage
over ordinary sailing vessels; for they
will cost less for construction and armament,
and still less in men, provisions and
munitions,?while they give a greater degree
of efficiency.
A few war steamers have already been
built or ordered to be built by Congress,
?and, we trust, their number is speedily
to beinereased. Welearn that Mr. Rhodes, 1
a most skilful naval architect, has been invited
to superintend , the building of one of !
them, and that he will probably undertake
it, provided the Board of Navy Commissioners
shall not interfere with the work.
It is the general opinion, both of lands- <
men and seamen, that the first thing to be
done, in order to render the Navv, as the
t '|
President says, "replete with efficiency,"
is to abolish the Board of Navy Commissioners.
j
It has been a common remark of late,
that, if the United States get info a war
(which may Heaven avert,) they will be
well whipped for the first year or two, and
then pay it back with interest. But if
unfortunately, war should come, why not
avoid the preliminary whipping, by timely
preparation, and repulse the enemy at
first as well as at last,?be fore our coast is
ravaged, and towns burnt, and resources
impaired,?as well after?

West India Trade.?Under various
systems, which some term reciprocal, the
West India Trade has so changed in the
last thirty-five years that there is not, it
would seem, a tithe of the business done j
now that there was in 1905. A correspondent
of the Star says he took up a copy
af the New York Gazette for 1805, and
found its columns filled with advertisements
notifying "the sailing of vessels for
every part of the West Indies." I was
induced to compare the number of said
advertisements in 1805 with a paper of
April. 1841. I found 35 in the old paper,
and 3 in the latter. What a falling off,
thought I, In this important trade, once so
profitable to the New York merchants!?
New Yrrk Express.
The facts here stated are sufficiently
interesting, as facts, to justify the calling
of public attention to them. But the in.
ference would hardly hold good that our
commercial intercourse with the West India
islands had fallen off in the same pro.
portion. In 1805, Great Britain and
France, by their reciprocal blockades,
having in a great measure cut off direct'
trade between the United States and both
those countries, the West India islands
became the ontrepots of a great proportion
of the trade between the United States
and those great markets for our produce.
Is not this the true explanation of the
great apparent extent of intercourse with
the West Indies at that time ?

PHENOMEN A AT THE NORTH POLE;
FROM A LATE ENGLTSH PAPER.
A St; Petersburg periodical, Lc Journal
Scicntifique, el Liter a ire, publishes a very
extraordinary narrative of an expedition
to the Arctic region, under the command
of M. Nidjnei Nitigoiwosneaenk. The
narrative says:
About the 88th degree of latitude
yielded' as one of the most curious (lis.
coveries that have enriched the physical
sciences in latter times. Itoccured thus:
For some days we had made no fire for
want of wood, when, in searching our box
of provisions, i found some Lyons chest

souvrencr. I took it into my head to roast,
them. We put together some shnvings
which we still had, and kindled them.'
A bright flame forthwith arose, and we
were anticipating the sweet sensations it
was about to yield us, when suddenly an
incomprehensible phenomenon manifest,
ed itself. The flame, at first so bright
and crackling, seertied struck with irruno.
bility, and was gradually covered with a
solid crust?it was congealed!
" Our astonishment baffles description.
(A scientific description of the ice thus
produced then follows.) I broke a
bit of it and put it into my mouth. Contrary
to my expectation, the sensation
which resulted was most agreeable ; just
fancy a little taste of barley sugar extremely
refreshing, though accompanied
by a *light burnt smell. I ain persuaded
that when such ice shall be produced by
artificial means, confectioners will turn it
to great account.
" A little further on another phenomenon,
not less remarkable, awaited us. We
had for some time perceived an increased
rapidity in the progress of our sledge,
though we used our iron hooks but little*.
Tko nlmnnmpnnn was soon explained ;
A I'V
owe of us having dropped his hook, the
moment he nttempted to pick it up we
saw it gradually romove from us, flee before
us, and ultimately whiz as it split the
dense atmosphere around us. Though
already accustomed to the wonders which
those mysterious regions had presented to
us, as it were, at every step, we stood
mute with astonishment, but were soon
roused from our amazement; our sledge,
which is almost wholly made of iron, t
seemed pushed on by a fatal, irresistible, i
and invincible power, such as that which
draws n light boat towards a cataract; <
we tried to stop it, but coul l not succeed
and were compelled to leave it to the
mercy of Heaven.
" The magnetic power of the pole produced
its effect, and, after a few hours of '
that fantastic progress, we were enabled
to perceive, by the light of an aurora borealis,
the sombre mysterious extremity of
our globe. It consisted of enormous
mountains probably of pure loadstone, divided
into huge strata of various colors, i
green or blue. One would Have fancied
the back of a gigantic zebra was rising before
us. Alas ! unless Providence vouchsafed
us unhoped-for assistance, we must
soon be dashed to pieces against it. Impelled
by the proud demon of science, we
had tempted Heaven, and already did we
feel its hand suspended over our heads
ready to crush us.
" Nevertheless, thus isolated in that
vast frozen solitude, and fatally dragged
to destruction, we were calm and resigned,
so great is the power of the grand mysteries
of Nature over man ! Some tears only
flowed in silence, and I heard beloved
names uttered, when suddenly, a sort of
barrier of icebergs, heaped over one anothor,
made us deviate from our course, and
at the same moment, and in a few seconds,
a force as powerful as that which had
made us before devour space in front of us
made us roughly recede. We were just
fallen into a negative magnetic current.
We were saved|and saved Co carry away
with us the most awful secret of Nature.
It was enough to run rnfcd with joy. We
raised our hands to Heaven."
THE SCOTTISH THISTLE.
The origin of this ancient emblem of
Scottish pugnacity, is thus handed down
by tradition ;?When the Danes invaded
Scotland, it was deemed unwarlike to attack
an enemy in the. pitch, darkness of
night, instead of a pitched battle by day :
but on one occasion the invaders resolved
I to avail themselves of this stratagem ; and
in order to prevent their tramp from being
heard, marched barefooted. They
had thus neared the Scottish force unob.
served, when a Dane unluckily stepped
with hisnakedjfoot upon a*?uperb!y prickly
thistle,and instinctively uttered aery of
pain, which discovered the assault to the
Scots, who ran to their arms, and defeated
the foe with a terrible slaughter.?The
thistle was immediately adopted as the in.'
signia of Scotland.

We published yesterday an account of
a bold and successful forgery, by which
the Commercial Bank of Cincinnatti and
Mr. Gwalhmey of Louisville, were each
swindled out of *$16,000. The same
trick has been played in this city, and
with the like success. A. few days since,
the following letter was received at the
Bank of America, covering the half of
what purported to be a certificate of de- . ,,
posite of $23,000 in specie in the Commercial
Bank of New-Orleans.

cate of deposite in his favor, for 929,000
specie, which please deliver to bin on
presentation of the first half.
Mr. Britton is unacquainted in your
city, and has adopted this course for
.safety and identity.
I recommend him to your favor.
Yours respectfully,
GEO. O. HALL, Cashier.
The above letter is an exact copy of
the one received at Cincinnati, with the
substitution of the name of Natbl. Britton
for'that of VV. M. Parker, and $23,000
for $13 000.
On Thursday of the last week the "Mr.. ?
| Britton" of the letter made h? appearance,
received of the Cashier of tHe Bank
of America the other half of the certificate
of deposite, and was by him introduced
to Jacob Little & Co., who cashed
the certificate by a check on the Union
Bank. On presenting this at the counter
of the bank payment was refused until
the teller should be satisfied that the presenter
was the person in whose favor the
1 check was drawn. He then went to Mr.
Little and finding him engaged, from
thence to Mr. Thompson, who accompanied
him to the hank, certified to his
; identity, and the money was paid,
j. Mr. Little has offered a reward-of
93,000 for the recovery of the money,
and a proportionate sum for any part
thereof.

yesterday, it appears that a like attempt
1 with the foregoing has been made at
j Philadelphia, but not with the like restilt:
j We gave the particulars yesterday of a
j most ingenious, extensive and successful
j forgery on a Bank in Cincinnati. We
! now learn that a similar attempt was
j made on the Girard Bank in this citv,
hut without success. So exact is the
imitation of the writing, the engraving,
and signatures of the drafts, and even the
f C
letters, that on comparison no difference
, is observable. Even the color of the ink.
on the counterfeit is the same as that on
those knotVn to be genuine. The trick
did not take here.
A similar attempt was . also made at
i Baltimore, but it was not successful, mere11
ly, according to the correspondent of tho
' | Courier, because the holder "was too close
1! in driving a bargain."
! What adds to the mystery of these forgeries
is the fact?for fact is beyond all

r taining the halfcertifiicate to Mr. Thompson,
must not only have been written m
the Bank at New-Orleans, but it must
have been written by the hand that is
s employed to copy the letters in the origint
al correspondence of Mr. Hall, the cashier.
Nor is this all: the letter introducing
i the pretended Mr. Britton, bears the gen,
uine signature of Mr. Hell, the cashier
I Two kinds of ink used also in the correspondence
of Mr. Hall, were used in the
spurious letter?both kinds being of the
9 exact shade of the genuine letters of Mr.
Hall. We have arrived at these conclusions
on a close comparison of thespur
rious with the genuine letters of Mr. Hall,
1 in company with several excellent judge*
J in such matters, whose opinions coincide
t \vith our own. ^
