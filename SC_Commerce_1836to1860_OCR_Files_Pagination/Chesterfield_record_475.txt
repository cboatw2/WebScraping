Mr. Clay continu d hi> spleen lo-u ?y, ?i
the distribution bill, making a more streroui
and labored effort on that subject that ho ha<
ever before made. He commenced, however
by referring to a matter not necessarily con
nected with the question, but which had beet
iucidentally br< ught by some o?e into the de
bate?the trade between France and the Um
ted States. He said that it now stood on i
very unequal and to us unfavorable footing
On our raw material. Cotton, France leviei
a duty ol 2 cents per ib. This raw materia!
after being wrought ur> in France, was madi
worth three or four hundred dollars a pound
and yet we admitted that manufacture as we)
as the other manufactures and products o
France free of duty. The balance of tradi
with France was always unfavorable to us
In saying this he did not wish to utter om
sentiment unfriendly to France. He had anx
? iously labored, on the contrary, to incre St
the trade with her, and had sought, by diffus
ing our irade, to break up the concentrator
of it in the ports of one powor. It was througr
his means that a clause was introduced in tin
tariff of 1832, m iking a difference of ten pei
cen' in the duty on silks from beyond the Cap<
of Good Hope and those from this side of it.
It was with extreme regret that he hac
heard a sentiment from a venerable friend o
his, in the other House, (Mr. Adams) tj the
effect that Louis Pliillipe had no right to th<
throne of France, either by descent or conquest,
or other title. He was sorry such i
a- n* intent had beeu^uttered, and he rou d 101
concur in it. t ranee, by the r-wolutio i o
1831, placed Louis I'lullipe on the throne am
for ten years she had assented to this movement
In his opinion, this gave him a bettci
title than could have been won by conquest,
or obtained by the accdent of birth. He
could not refrain from adding that this distinguished
monarch had governed his people, in
tire midst of unprecedented difficulties, with
more firmness and wisdom than any of his conA

which, once commenced, would have involved

The House, to day, refusod, by a decid ed
majority, to graut leave to Mr. Morris of
Ohio to .niroJuco his bill to repeal the Sjbtreasury.
Tliey also refused to take up the private
business. The special order, six : the Treasury
note bill was tak?*n up. and Mr. Wis ??o itiir
ued his speech thereou. Before Mr Wise
commenced, Mr. Rhett of S. C asked him to
give w?y for an inquiry- Mr. Rhott said that
Mr. W*e, in the course of Ins speech yesterday,
had stated tiihl a gentleman, now a membnr
of this House, had proposed a dissola'ion
of tho Union, in the South Carolina Convention
As th re was no oth*r member of this
House who was a member oflkat Convention,
he would ask the gentleman whether he was
0 referrejJ.o.
Mr. W ise replied, that, in speaking o tke
consequences of the late protective system, he
had asserted that n disturbed the harmony ol
the U iien? and had nearly dissolved the Union,
that he had understood, and it was generally
reported and b l oved at that time, that the
gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Rhett)
b -d proposed or intended to pi* po?e a dissolution
cf the Union, in the S< uth Carolina C?>n -

b en uiisinforincd, and hoped ho would be corree'ed
Mr. Rhstt assumed the gentleman that
rich vva^ not tho n et. No such propisitoris
was mad* or contemplated by him.
Mr. Wise sard he w s very happy to hear it.
Mr. Wise spoke, to.day, chiefly upon the
projects of the whit; party and a portion of thf
o'her oarty to revive the protective Tariff.
The Tobacco Convention have joined in the
clamor for countervailing duties, and he un.
d r'oak 10 shew those duces would eventually
tall upon theproduc ng interests of the South.
The Senate havj sent a message 10 the
House informing them thai th y had inuletht
uuuaI arrangements to meet the House on the
second Wednesday in February, for tue purpose
of counting the votes for l'rdsidcnt anc

It is very evident that Mr. Wise does no
intend to support the new administration, ou
and out, but will take an indepenet position ai
teallparces- The whigs appear tc be dig
connected at this movement, and there is mucl
chuckling thereat amcng the Van Burcn men

Correspondence of the Journal of Commerce
Washingfon, Jan 29th.
In the House, to.day, Sir. Calvan
Morris moved to suspend the rules so as t<
I enable him to move for leave to introduce
a bill to repeal the Sub Treasury actbut
the motion was rejected.
The House refused to take up any othc
business, and went into committee on tb<
TREASURY JIOTB BILL.
Mr. Wise continued his remarks o
this subject with great energy and earp
estness. He labored to show the Intpqlic
if w*<*iirrenrft to the Drotective systenr
w* - . ?
which had at one time endangered th
continua nee of the Union.
Mr. Rhett pf S. C. begged leave t
make ail explanation. He had undei
stood tfte member to say, yesterday, ths
a member of thb House, who was a men:
s ber of the S. C. Convention there move<
e that the Union be dissolved. He wasthi
. only person here who was a member o
t that Convention, and he wished to knov
t if he was alluded to.
Mr. Wise replied that it was generall;
P reported and believed?he himself alway
believed?that the gentleman, (Mr
* Rhctt,) did, offer, or intended to offer, ii
* the South Carolina Convention, a projec
* Cot a dissolution of the Union. If it wai
* not true, he would be glad to know it.
n Mr- Rhett replied that the rumor wai
i without foundation. He neither offeret
nor contemplated any such proposition,
e Mr. Wise said he was hnppy to hear it
s But he went on to show the danger of re
q newing that system, which was so oppres
j siveto the South. The subject of iinpos
ing^ountervaiiing duties for the benefi
I of the Tobacco interest, he discussed hi
length, showing that the plan ling interes
s would suffer most by this legislative retah
ation.
In the Senate Mr. White presented fht
Resolutions of the State of Indiana, in fa
1 vor of a National Bank expressing at the
s same time his full conviction " that an in

' brilliant effort in support of his favorit<
j measure, and I shall be much disappoin
j i ted indeed, if the system does not becom*

t | measure, than the resolutions introduce!

t was it ever thougni of! what voice wo*
i

men of this country ever dreamed of such
| a thing ? and yet at a moment when the
credit of these Slates was most needed
. that abstract proposition was wantonly.
. wickedly, and inhumanly presented to th(
> consideration of the American Senate,
1 Could it be doubted that their credit woj
deeply affected by such a proceeding, anc
, at such a time'{ Distributing the pro'
ceeds of the lands, he did not consider as*
suining the debts of the States, but paying
our debts to them !
In the course of his speech Mr. Clay, in
reply to the charges of being, the "dictator
of the new party," said he had not
i heard a word from Gen. Harrison, had

Webster, and that was that had he, Mr,
C.?been elected, he could not have overlooked
a gentleman of such high and commanding
talent, and of such signal service
to his country.?this much he had said

the policy of the eastern States in regar
f Tariff. It seemed to be taken for gran

5 high protective Tariff. He protested a
gainst this idea. He could say, on th
part of Massachusetts, that he dcsire<
? no revision of the Compromise act, tha
would do injustice to any of the great in

The most important question that

ubject is of vast import, both as re^n

hould Governor Seward be permitted i

ave the effect to place those relation*
be most eminent jeopardy. The G
rnor, I think has erred in his construct
f the constitution?it was his duty
er the circumstances, to have delive
p the fugitives from offended justi
n tHe request of the Executive of Vir?
i. As he construes it, there can c
tinly exist no force, no protection,
ifeguard, in the Constitution. Tak
