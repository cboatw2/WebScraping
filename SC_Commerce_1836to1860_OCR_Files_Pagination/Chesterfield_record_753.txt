Im Exchequer,
At thin stsgo of tho affair, the leaders
took choir stand end commenced a furious
attack on tho President and tho Administration,
and denounced thorn both; and,
having got up much excitement, they a.
vowed that if any man, as a Whig, gave
the Joast countenance to tho plan of tho
President, he would be a traitor to his
party, and as such should bo presented to
his country.
"Still many of tho moro discreet and
liberal Whigs manifested a disposition to
sustain tho Exchequer and do something
to relieve the ombarrnsmonts of tho nation.
. "At this stage of the game a letter from
Mr. Clay was brought forward and read.
In .that most precious documont ho urged
that it was the duty and tho policy of the
Whigs to defeat the Exchcquor and leave
the country to suffer. Lot the pcoplo
fed,' said tho writer of the lettor adroitly ;
'let thorn suffer ; and, casting the responlibility
of the act on the shouldors of the
President, as they will, they will soon become
outrngoous, and blight the last hopes
?f his aaeondency. But if you givo them
in Exchequer, it may relieve them aomowhat;
it may afford something of that
pecuniary aid they seek, and tho Whigs
will bo divostod of the capital they work
upon/
"Such vm the substance if not the
rery letter,.of the epistle, end it was not
vitnout its effect. A long and an anninatcd
debate erisued, and finally the
question was taken by ayes and noes. It
is not known what was thd exact vote,
tot is known that the minority v?as very
itrong, and that the majority lin favoi'of
attracting in tavcus the Committoe of
l?ays end Moans to report against tbo
Exchequer did not exceed four votes.
**A majority obtained after overy thing

** Tho night before tho Commit too of
Ways and Moans was to roport on the
ttxcbequer bill, a'caucus' of the Whigs
woe held, and tho subject was taken up
[or consideration.
" After consultation and debate had
>een had, it was found that there was a
itrong and determined disposition on the !
partof the Whigs to report favorably and
to volo in favor of the bilf. Indeed, thcro
was a majority of tho caucus in favor of
such an issue. In tho midst of this stnte
r>f feeling, it was urged by unprincipled
leaders 1 hat, if tho bid found a favorable
report, nnd should by any chance bo ndop.
ted, it would at nnco ensure the popularity
of the Administration, nnd facilitate
the prosperity of the President. This of
w
jt\\ probability* would hrtVO beci
Onoiigji the biU, and secure tin
defeat of mo Exchequer scheme ; but otrf
'or aids wcro called in to consummate th<
unprincipled baseness of tho Whigs.
"Toeomplot* tho work of inkpiity, i

ted at Hatchoz, in whicn it wns urgei
that Congress ought to linger on till th<
4<h of March, do nothing Tor tfio country

My aourcoa of information arc correc

cannot bo donicd by the Whigs in Con
gross.
" But for the acts of the Whig caucu
the Commit too of Ways and Means wouli
havo reported the Exchequer bill on thi
basis of the schome presented by the Ex
ocutive ; it would have been taken up it
tho House, and been adopted by the votei
of the Democrats, aided by tho libera
Whigs."
Tho House (continued Mr. Fillmore
would now perceive that grave chargei
were brought against the conduct of (hi
Committee of Ways and Means, in report
ing against the Exchequer. Tho firsi
charge contained in the articlo in th<
Union, and reiterated in this letter in th(
Madisonian. was this >
"It had been ascertained that a major
ity of the more discreet Whigs were ir
favor of the Exchequer schome recora
monded by tho Executive; and it wt<
further ascertained that it was very prof)
able that the Committee of Ways arid
Means would report in favor of tho b II
brought forward by Mr. Cushing. Then
facts having reached the ears of the leapera
of the Clay faction, a caucus was ordered
and holden, and went into operation
tho night before the report of that committee
was made."
With regard to the single fact stated
hero, Mr. F. desired to say that the rep<irl
from tho Committee of Ways and Menni
to this subject was made on Monday morning
; so that if a caucus was held on the
night preceding that report, by the Whigs,
in reference to this subject, it must hn/e
been held on Sundoy evening, and ho desired
to say that no caucus was hohkn
either at that or anv other time, to Kin
know ledge, with any such object, or wlien
any such proceeding* took place a* is alleged
in this paragraph. No communication
or information had ever come to hu
knowledge [A voico: "Or to the knowledge
of any body."] from any source,
that a Whig caucus had been held, at
which it was dotorminod what kind of a
report should be made in this case.
The next charge was as follows:
"At tho opening of the caucus it wafl
plain that a majority of the Whigs present,
wonry of waging a reckless, unprofitable,
and infamous opposition to the
People's will, had determined to go forth,
like men, and sustain the President and
tho Exchequer.
At this stage of the affair the leaders
took their stand and commenced a furious
attack on the President and the Administration,
and denounced them both;
and having got up much excitement, they
vowed that if any man, as a Whig, gave
the least countenonco to the plan of the
President, he would be a traitor to hie
party and as such should be presented to
his country.
"Still many of the more discreet and
littoral Whigs manifested a disposition to
sustain the Exchequer, and do something
to relievo the embarrasmeiit of tho na.
fion."
j?,\ F. hnd only to sny in rofercnco to
that, that ho had no knowledge of any
such act at any lime. He had no l?eliel
in nny such thing hai'jng taken place,
If it had he challenged any it,dividual on
this floor to rise and say he knew of it*
The next charge was?
"At this stage of (he game, a letter
from Mr. Clay was brought forward and
read. In that most procious document
he urged that it was the duty and the
policy or (no Whigs (o defeat the Exchequer
and leave the country to suffer."
Then followed (mid Mr. F.) whnt perported
to be a copy or an extract from
thut letter. He had only to say in reforonce
to it that he knew not whnt Mr,
Clny's sentiments were in reference tc
this subject; that he had never heard
that Mr. Clny had ever written a lettci
to nny person ill reference to this sub'
jeet; that no such letter had ever beer
produced or spoken of or alluded to al
any meeting or caucus of the Whigs 01
cf any other portion of this House thai
he had attended, and thut the only knowl
ec.',TO ho had in reference to Mr. Clay'i
opinions in rognrd to thismntter was thai
general itnowlodgo which ho should infei
from his (Mr. Ch?y'?) character and pub
lli> /-nniinni And from no other Mlllm
whntovcr.
Having denied most unequivocally nnj
knowledge of any caucus at which anj
part of Iho proceedings here detailed tool
place, Mr. F. could only say, in referonci
to the wholo statement here contained
that so far as it related to any action o
the Whig party of whicli ho had an)
knowledge, it 1oat unequivocally and also
lulely false?and if thero wiunny mem
her on this floor who knew any facts other

to it, to tho ndoptioh of the House And

j investigation of tho subject, with this doQ
sire on his part, thnt he had como to tho
conclusion that ho could not discharge
J bib duty to the IIouso and to tho country,
. but by recommending tho rejection of tho
o plain of tho President.
He did not know thnt his duty toliiino
so|f or to any other genttemno required
that ho should say more. There wcro
t ojiher monitors of tho committee hero,
l' and if they had nny knowlodgo of this
* subject beyond his, or different from it,
lje hoped thoy would riso and givo that
? knowledge to tho House and to the world.
Ho was askod (and ho had no objections
to stating if it was in order) how long it
, was beforo this report wos made thnt tho
rnfflmil(?n enmn t<> tlia Mnnluunn at
1 which they finally arrivod in the report*
Ho would say that the committeo took up)
) tho subject and investigated the several
? documents carefully, and when thoy came
) to the final result there was no difference
of opinion in the committee in rcferonc^
1 to it, and that it was at least two weeks,
' nnd ho should think more, before tho re.
port was made to this Hou90. It wns
then directed to be drawn up, and time
' wan givon for it, and for canvassing it in
committee, before it was finally submitted
, to the House.
If there was any member of the com*
| mittce whoso recollection differed from
I his in regard to this thing, or if there wan
i any member of this House Whig, or
Democrat, or who belonged to what wns
usually denominated " the guard," who
> had any knowledge of fncts different from
' what he had now stated, he hoped that
member, whoever ho might be, would riso
' and stato it, that he might hnvo an op'
portunity for correction. He had stated
' the facts as he understood them.
| Mr. Wise inquired if he understood
that the gentlemnn from New York (Mr.
, Fillmoro) intended to impute to him (Mr.
, W.,) or any other memlwrof what he
, choose to call "the guard," nny part or
i lot in this publication in "tho Union"
i or in " the Madisonian ?"
Mr. Fillmore. Most certainly not;
1 he would not suspect any member on this

' so disgraceful an act.

Mk- Marshall?Mr. Wbiistbr.?
The following is an extract from a late
speech of Mr. Marshall's, in the House of
Representatives, in which ho describes
Mr. Webster in delivering his speech in
roply to General Hayne, on tho subject
, of nullification.
i Sir, I apoko the other day of the imI
prcssion made upon mj imagination by
the great Senator from Massachusetts
when I saw and heard him for the first
time put forth his vast powers in debnto.
The Democratic prints sometimes call
him the "godlike" in derision. To me
that day ho seemed almost divine. lie
looked the Olympian Jove in Council.
Had colestial wisdom chosen a mortal res.
idence, on that majestic brow she might
have fixed her throno. The massive grandare,
philosophic cast, and rigorous contour
of tho head, all giving infallible inI
dication of tho possession and intense oxt
ertion of the higher faculties of reasoning
I and investigation, contrasted, yet hnrmo.
, nised with the wild and dreamy light that
streamed from the large, dark, unfnlhnm,
able eyes, flashing as they rolled, the very
, soul of idealism and romanco.
P Never was the appearance of a man
more in perfect keeping with the true
' character of his intellect; ncvor were
1 head and face more truly tho typo of tho
genius which animated them. Never
wC.r? more varied, wonderful, and to vul'
gar npprC.'ieft-'don, incompatible faculties
I conferred "on any n?*n. Profoundly learned*
he exhibitod its reWl.1' I * rather than its
processes. No clumsy, fabgu'.'ng. pedantic
array of the immense mnss of his
knowledge; no tedious details of the vast
range of facts from which ho had deducod
his principles, loaded your attention
or retarded his argument. He had studied
the history of nil nations, and extracted
the universal truths impressed upon
(hem all that he might apply them (o the
peculiar constitution and practical affairs
of his own.
He had bathed in (ho fountains-and
quaffed from (he genuine source of knowledgo
and of truth, and came Ihonce imbued
and reeking with the essencoof phi-1
losophy, whilo he tramplod and rejected
the trammels of tho schoolman's jargon,
scorning to employ as (ho instruments of
his demonstrations the formal categories
of a tecnical logic. Yet tho clusrness,
closeness, simplicity and accuracy of his
statement of general propositions, and the
intense, rigorous, unsparing sorority with
which he enforced and applied them, neither
chilled the glowing nor curbed the
granduro of his stylo. A long nnd swelling
volume of his speech rolled proud
philosophy, seated in the triumphnl car,
clad in tho gorgoous vest moots, and breaf
I thing from ovory part tho rich perfumes
f of poetry itself. And what, whut was his

Tho Now Orleans Tropic gives the fol.
lowing narrative of facts which led to tho
imposition of the fine of 91000, which
Gen. Jnckion's friends in Congress are
now seeking to have refunded.
The ever memorable battle of New Orleans,
as all know, wns fought on the 0th
ot January, 1815. That boltlo was de.
cisivo in its character and in its results.
The troops of Great Britain, flushed with
the hopes of an easy conquest, were de*
fcated, driven back in disgrace, leaving
their General and the flower of the army
among the slain. Those who know aay*
thing of the history of the times, know
the courage and devotion displayed upon
that occasion by all classes of our citizens.
Almost every man capable of bearing
arms shouldered a musket and rushed to
meet the invader, and among those who
fought hnrdest and bled freest, the
French population of the city were eminently
distinguished. Tousard, the French
Counsel at New Orleans, though forbidden
to enlist himself, was most active in I
inducing his countrymen, residents of the 1
city, to enroll themselves, and with perhaps
a few exceptions they rallied around
the stars and stripes with as much alacrity
aa the bravest Amoricnn citizen. Men
owing allegianco to la belle France, did
as much servico on that glorious occasion 1
as nny whoever pulled a trigger, and they 1
did it without the hope or expectation of 1
reward. Many of these bravo fellows a- 1
bandoned their families and homes, de- 1
termined not to lay down their arms while
the foe was within our reach and nobly
did they rudeem their pledgo. They did
not retire until our proud invaders were 1
humbled?until our rivors ran red with I
thnir blood, and our flolds were covered 1
with their slain. Rut when tho enemy
had been repulsod, and our arms were 1
covered with a signal, and so far as wo
were concerned, an almost bloodless vie- I
tory, then, and then only, they asked for
permission to retire?for leavo to return
to their deserted homes I As they wore
citizens of anothor country, men who had
volunteered defend our soil, this request 1
seemed to be the most natural one in th"
world. The exigency which had called
them forth hud passed away, their servi. 1
cos wcro no longer needed ; and when the
r<>til of our fona no lomrnr nolliitnrl iKn soil
" " ? J" O? 9
of Louisiana?when news of the ratification
of the treaty of peace between Great 1
Britain and our Government had been received,
then, and not till thon, they naked
what they were by every consideration '
entitled to, a dischnrgo from further duty!
Thcso applications, tho reader will remember,
wero made on the 22d day of
February, and more than a month after the
battle! The first applications for discharge
were granted upon the presentation of
certificates of their national chnracter,
signed by Tousard, the French Counsel,
already spoken of. The first applicants
were readily discharged by General Jack*
son, but tho number increasing more than
ho calculated on, he got into a towering
passion, and orderod Tousnrd to leave tho '
city. On the Inst day of February ho issued
a general order, commanding all
Frenchmen having Tousnrd** certificates,
countersigned by himself, to retire from
the city to some point above Baton Rouge!
[n addition to this, a list of the names of
all persons who did not leave within three
days, was directed to be taken.
That so ungracious a return should
have been mnde to the gallant fellows who
had aided in the defence of the city, very
nniurally, excited a great deal of feeling.
Papers from Washington, announcing the
urrival of the troaty, hud been rccoived,
ana ine orucr 01 ucncrai JacKson was
considered exceedingly harsh and unnecessh.'V.
At this stage of tho proceedings,
Louallicr, u native of France but a member
of the Lcgibblure from Opalousas,
and ono of tho moat active and efficient
members in all that trying time, wrote
and publishod in the Courier, an article
of some length in which ho reviewod
General Jacksons order with some severity,
nod recommended the persons alluded
to, to remain quietly nt their homes.
This publication appeared on the 3d of
March, and at once, the pent up wrath of
General Jackson burst forth. No persuaded
himself that Lounllier could be tried
by a Military Court Martial as a spy, and
hung up without ceremony. With this
viow he caused to be published, the second
section of tho rules nnd articles of
urnp u/lkir*lt ilnnAtinpna llin i\mtiaKmnnl r?f

death ngaingt spies ! Accompanying thin
section wan a notice, that tho "city of
New Orionri9 und iln environs, being tinder
martial law, and several enenmpmontn
and fortifications within its limits, it was
doomed necessary to give publicity to tho
section for thu information of all concerned
!"
This publication won made on tho 4th
of Murch, and tho next day, Sunday, tho
5th, Loutillicr was arrested and confined !
Mere it was that tho trouble commenced,
and here it may not he improper to
add, that in Dccomhor previous, the Logisluturo
had refused to comply with tho
wishes of (Jen. Jackson and suspend
tho operation of tho writ of habeas corpusf
That body wisely determined not to outlaw
the citizens of the Stale by depriving
thoin of that great bulwuk of personal
liberty.
I'. The counsel of Louallior applied to
:(!<lllt of the Unitod State* District
for a writ of Habeas Corpus, and
Immediately gave his fiat. Gen. Jackson
at once conceived that he could try >
Judge (Tall also before a Court Martial,
und hang him and forthwith he signed a
w urrant for his arrest, and the mittimus for
his imprisonment t Judge lltllt Was accordingly
nrrcstod at his Ikmiso that flight,
and con lined in the satne room with Louallior
in. the barracks! This done an of- &
fi :or was dispatched' to Claiborne, Hie
Clerk of the Court, with demand (of |
Louallicr's petition, on the buck of which
Judge (fall had made his drder, This the

if it was his intention to verve the writ, to ]
which ho promptly responded, yea! lie
too was threntenod with an arrest, bul be
was not to be moved by menaces from
the discharge of his duty. Ho had hand,
ed the petition of Louallier to Gen. Jack,
son when he entered, and upon retiring,
demanded it, but his demand was treated
with contempt and the paper withheld
from him ! Upon the arrival of Duples*
sis tho Marshal, who was one of Jacksen'a
Volunteer aids, he was asked if he would
serve the writ, and when ho answered in
the affirmative, he too was pointed to the
proclamation of martial law, and threat,
encd with nrrest.
Dick, the Attorney of the United States,
applied to Judgo Lewis, ef one of the
Slate Courts, for n writ of Habeas Corpus
to release Judge Hall, and tho writ was
granted. An soon as Gen. Jackson was
ndvisod of this, he ordered Lewis aod
Dick to bo arrested 1 and Gen. Arbuclo,
who had charge of Judge Hall, refused to
obey Judgo Lewis' writ I
This was on the 6th of March, and
Gen. Jackson was morally convinced that
a treaty of peace had been ratified I On
tho 8th he announced that he had 44 perluasivo
evidence" of the fact, and his first
duty was to discharge the body of tho
militia of tho Stale!
When tho court martial for the trial of
Louallier catne on, on tho Oth of March,
he pl?d want of jurisdiction to all tho
specifications, and the Court sustained his
plea on all the charges, save nno, and on
this one, tluiy acquitted him I
At tho rosult of this trial General Jack,
son was greatly disappointed and mor.
lifted, but he did not reloase any of hie
prisoners! Tho acq ittnl of Lounllier,
however convinced Gun. Jackson it would
be useless to try Judgo Hall on the an me
charge, and on the 11th of March he wan
reloasod from prison, conducted by a guard
several mi'e? beyond tho limits ef the
city and order'd not to return 4* until the
ratification of the treaty was regularly
announced, or the British shall hava left
tho Southorn coast!"
What fol'owod may ho related lira few
words: On the 13th official information
of tho ratification of tho treaty was re.
ccived.nnd shortly afterward* Judge Hall
returned to tho city. On tho 31st; the
affidavits of tho Clerk of the District
Court, of the Marshal of the IInU?il ? ???.
of the Attorney of Louallior, nnd of the
Comma ndor of the n*rrnrkn, were laid
before (ho Judgo, nnd on the motion of
tho United Stated Attorney, n rule to show
cause why process of attachment should
not issuo against Jackson, was granted.
Tho rest is soon told. Gen. Jackson was
brought into Court, nnd for his contempt
of that tribunal fined $1000 and costs!
To show that Gen. Jackson's conduct
in the order to the Fronch population,
and the imprisonment of LnuaUiur and
Hall, was wholly unnecessary, it is only
necessary to make nn extract from his
defenco, in which ho ndmits that "most
of the acts mention- d in the rule took
placo after tho enemy had retired from
tho place lie had at first assumed?after
thoy had met with a signal defeat?and
after nn unofficial account had heen received
of the signature of the treaty."

TUB ORROOJi BILL.
After some, (a very little, nnd not importnnt,)
incidental business, the bill for
tho occupation and settlement of the Oregon
Territory was token up again.
Mr. McDufTio, of South Carolina, had
tho floor. He thought there had been
some precipitation in bringing forward
this measure. He hod no doubt of tho
titlo of the United Stulcs to (lie territory,
at least as far as 49 deg. North latitude.

and Iho other party is as confident of its
title as we are of ours. And how is this
to bo settled? And what is the existing
emergency, to cull upon ua at this unpropitious
moment to adopt the hostile course
described in this bill, and that, too, aftor
slumbering over it through long years of
profound peace, and unparalleled prosperity,
when there was no legitimate or illo*
giliinntn modo of expending money, of
which the government of tho time did not
avail itself?
Mr. McDudio alluded, with strong ap.
probation, to tho courso of the English
Government in tho Into negotiation, and
to tho present Administration for the ed>
miinhlo treaty which was its happy result;
