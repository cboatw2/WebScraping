We copy the following from the Fayette, j
ville Observer. In what paper it was tirsl;
published we do not know.
Mr. Adams recently caused a great ex- j
Citement in the f louse of Representatives ;
by & speech of which the following in the j
substance :
Mr. JonsQ. Adams, availed himself of;
the occasion to offer a few words, and j
stated that this country was on the verge of1
Mexican war, an Indian war, and a war
with England.
"He said that by our course in the af- '
faiitf of Texas, we are courting a war with !
Mexico; and that England would fly to the
rescue of that country. He said England '
wmt.M never consent to our having Mexico. i
without her permission; and if she assented i
to any such proposition, she would tell us, I
that we could not have Texas, unless we j
consented to abolish slavery within the
domain. He said that England would
unite in*hc war of Mexico, for the purpose
of aidiftg the cause of emancipation; a
cause to which she was now devoted, and
of the sincerity of her attachment to which, j
she had given abundant proof by cmancipa* j
ting her colonics.
"Mr. Adams then related some facts
connected with the foreign relations of this
country, one of which was, that a secret'
offer had been made at one time by a party j
In the Island of Cuba, to be annexed to the :
United States. He said that the proposi- j
tion had also been made to England and to ,
France; and that England, at the time, I
was so jealous of the movements ot the
Cubians, that Mr. Canning was instructed .,
to apprise this country, that any such ar- '<,
rangement on our part, would be the cause
of war. , |
u Mr. Adams produced much sensation |
in the House, and there were not a few who ,
believed with him, that we are on the eve *
of internal and external difficulties."

indian relations. ) j
On Friday last, in the House of Rc-j i
presentatives, Mr. Everett, of Vermont,! <
made a speech of great length and elaborateness,
upon the general relations of this (
Government with the Creek and Seminole i
Indians. In the course of his remarks, he |
exhibited an intimate acquaintance with : I
the details of the subject, which intelligence ! <
and industry only could have attained. -His i
observations tended tosliow that the Treaty ! I
(of removal) with the Scniinoles was in- I
valid, because its conditions had not been:
complied with on our part; and because,!
furthef, not having been ratified by our :
Government, till nearly a year after it was ' i
concluded, impediments had, in the interim,1;
been made known to our Goverument, the :
existence of which would have prevented
the jnaking of the treaty, if known, be- ,
cause they were sufficient to render its execution
impossible. Me followed up the ';
UV/UUii VI IIJV? VIU* Villlliv 111) iJwv?iio?, ? ??? t
the subsequent acknowledgement of the I
treaty, alter the Indians had denied its <
validity, was obtained by threats, accom- !'
panicd with an armed force, as was re. <
presented, sufficient to compel an nc-1 j
quiescence ill the ordct* for removal; and ; 1
those threats, with the presence of troops, , 1
and many irritating circumstances which \ <
occurred, were the cause of the hostilities 11
now existing. He argued, first, that the'*
treaty was not obligatory on the Seminolos: \ 1
secondly, that the Government had at- J i
tempted to entbrce if, in a seme contrary to j!
their own construction of it; and, thirdly, i <
that they had attempted to execute it by an ! ]
aft of tear before any hostile act had been <
committed bv the Seminole nation. The j1
speech will be published as early as our ' i
reporters can furnish it, and will deserve all !
ihe reader's attention. \
The remarks of Mr. Ashley and others j
on the same subject, but upon different i
grounds, were also entitled to great res. j
pcct.
Mr. White, of Florida, spoke earnestly ;
in reply; after which, a general expression j
of a desire for more information induced ;
the House fo. postpone fhe bill for a day or ?
two, in order to obtain additional documents j
from the War Department; and resolutions j
were adopted calling for them.
a magnificent project.

The prospect of the indepedence of!
- Texas has given rise in New Orleans to
a splendid design which if carried out,
will create quite a new era in the history |
?f a part of the commerce of this country.
It is well known that steamboats of
500 or 600 tons burthen can ascend the
Red River as high as Natchitoches?and ;
it id now proposed, in a New Orleans j
paper, that a rail road shall be constructed !
from that point through a gorge in the;
Southern Rocky Mountains and thence

would gi' e to New Orleans access to the
East Indian, Peruvian and Chilian trade
which would enable her to set competition
at defiance. It appears to us,
however, that it is not by the Red ltivcr, j
but by the Rio Grande, that this coin- i
muaication. must be effected, if at all. ;
This last river has a course estimated at
from 1500 to 1700 miles^in extent, and 1
can be ascended by steamboats of light j
burthen nearly seven hundred miles,
which will be within an inconsiderable j
distance of the Colorado of the West, a ;
river that empties into the Gulf of Cali-!
fl&rnia. It is probable that a portage rail j
road connecting these two rivers need not!
he of greater length than two hundred i
iniles.

We see it stated in a leading Jackson
paper of Pennsylvania, that there was a
meeting lately held in Philadelphia, by
persons favorable to Jackson and Van
Buren, at which a resolution was passed,
requiring that, in case Van Burcn should
be elected, the-present official incumbents
be displaced. In announcing the fact, the
Jackson paper adds : " Rotation in office is
a principle dear to the Democracy of |
Pennsylvania. It is necessary that some i1
distinct assurance of a complete reform ; j
should be given/'?Alex. Gaz.

Burning of Abolition Pamphlets.?We ; j
learn from Marion county, that consider- j.
able excitement was lately produced a- |*.
mongst its citizens, by reports of the ]
reception of boxes of abolition pamphlets 1
in that quarter. Search was made, and '
two boxes were found, tilled with these in- !
cendiary productions. They were im- j j
mediately seized by tho people, and com-11
mittcd to the flames in Palmyra. Two or ;'
three individuals, to whom they were di- J *
rooted, or in whose possession t hey were J
found, were also taken, and a limited period j
given them to make their escape from the 1 '
State. * A meeting of the citizens was j1
called to be held this day, for the adoption j t
of such measures as may he necessary to J t
protect themselves against the reckless ef- j
forts of these disturbers of social order, i(
The particulars will probably reach us in a ! *

-1 Singular Circumstance.?The sciioo-'
nor (Hide arrived at (Gloucester on Sun- J
day, having fallen in, on the Grand Ranks i a
with the fishing schooner Hold Runner 1 a
which had not a single individual on hoard, j r
but had been deserted bv her crew probably j ti
only ufjw hours before she was fallen in 'p
with by the Glide; a wacli in the cabin going
at the time. The cable was hove short; and ! a
from the appearance of the vessel, and that: v
jackets oftbo crew lying near the windlass, 1 o
it is evident that, while getting the anchor v
op. sonic great and sudden apprehension of, s
danger induced them to quit their vessel 11<
witliout ceremony. As the schooner ap-! p
pears to have sustained some injury, it is j
thought that she was run into by some i fi
v essel crossing the bank; and the crew, in j ti
the confusion of the moment, gained the ! it
decks of the other vessel. The Hold j t(
Runner had only 10 incites of water in the j e
bold, and was pumped out, manned, and j
brought salely into (rloucoster harbor.? ' a

regulated by a severe taste, as is every thing J (
about the house. There is not a particle j(
of tinsel upon the premises. All is in the ;
first style 6f elegance?chaste and simple j j

mar the general effect. Indeed, we can j 1
think of no better mode of conveying a ; ^
correct idea oft!? vvhtl; interior than L
simply to say that every portion of it is in !
good keeping wtth the exterior; and to !
those who have seen the noble building 1J
from Broadway, this wc take it is praise1 ^
enough. It is unquestionably, in site, j'
architecture, and material the most im- j

not the largest house constructed expressly j'

where, by the multiplication of stationary J?'

SPLENDID APPROPRIATIONS FOR INTERNAL IMPROVEME
NTS.
The Legislative of the little State of Maryland
at its present extra session has appropriated
eight millions of dollars to carry on works of
internal improvement.
Tlio bill passed the Senate by a vole of 11 to
2, and the IIouso of Delegates bv a vote of 43
to 29.
The Annapolis Republican of Juno 4th says :
" The law appropriates three millions to complete
the Chcsapeako and Ohio Canal to Cumberland;
thrco millions to continuo the Baltimore
and Ohio Railroad to the Ohio, one million
to construct the Railroad running down the
Kastern Shore from Cecil county to Pocomoke
bay; half a million for a canal to connect
Baltimore with the Chesapeake and (Hiio Canal
1 by the most northern routeand half a million
to connect Annapolis with the Chesapeake
md"Ohio Canal. It provides for a loan at six
tier cent. redeemable in fifty years, for the above
purposes, upon which loan not less than twenty
wrccnt. premium inust be obtained, amounting
oonc and a half million ; which will constitute
l sinking fund adequate to redeem the principal
n- years, all the profits of the several improvcuients
lieing pledged to the State for the
>ayment ot fix pot cent, interest upon the sevc ;il
sums received by them, after three years
roin their receiving the same."
