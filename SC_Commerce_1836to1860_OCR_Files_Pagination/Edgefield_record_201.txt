1TIII! recent Fire in Charleston, has laid
waste 1n acres of the most popilons
part or the City-as destroved buildings
and their contents, valued between three
and four millions of dollars-has deprived
great numbers of industrious men of the
means of re-instating"v their property piros
trated in the comon i atatioiiu. It has
greatly injured all the Insurance Olices,
and rendered bankrupt others in the State,
(the amount of property insured elsewhere
being comparatively sniall.) It has de
prived the hank debltors not only of tle
means of p aying their present debts but of
procuring fiture loans and facilities, now
more than ever, greatly necded, and in
many eases abhsoltely iindiitsnsble to save
the unfortinaie debtor from utter destrue
tion. It has puit to hazard the uhimaie
success of our great national improvement
the uecstcrn ra, road, and ihe dott.qic im
porting- company; al w ith these, it threat
en to jeopardise the fiuture prosperity and
the high claracter and standinig ol'tle Siate

Under these cirenmstances. the late mis
fortiie asiumes decidedly not a partial and

to be felt in every part of SoutiI Carolina,
and lie partial prostration of' our metropio
