It suffereth long and is kind: It oxercises. t
candor, indulgence, and forbearance in re- c
sard to the conduct of others, entering into | i
W v;?^
their feelings with gentleness and kindness, c
and making every allowance for the circumstances
in which they are placed, and the s
motives and feelings by which they are in- f
fluenccd. This disposition prevents us from a
hastily assigning unworthy motives or bad f
intentions; it induces us to take the most t]
favorable view that we possibly can of the c
conduct of other -men, and, even when ap- <j
pcaranccs axe against them, to endeavor ?
anxiously to discover favorable views and c
palliating circumstances. It thus leads us s
to bo slow to take offence, to be unwilling t!
to consider injuries as intended, to be above e
taking offence at trifles, and under real iuju- t!
xies, to be easily conciliated and ready to d
forgive. This temperament of mind is y
strikingly contrasted with one which we find c
so common in the world,?envious, suspi- k
cious,and censorious,?ready to be offended $

ces into intended insults and to impute to tl
others bad intentions on the most frivolous ti
grounds. Such a disposition is a source of
wretchedness to those who art? under its a
power, and of fcnhappincss to a!! with whom c
they are connected; and we cannot survey t;
the distress which arises from ill-regulated o
temper, without perceiving how much the v
present happiness ofmen would be increased c
by the exercise of that charily which suffer- e
cth long and is kind. r,
The kindness, which is hero associated f
with long suffering, seems to be distinct iirom o
the exercises of benevolence refeired to unl a
der the former division of the subject. It ?
appears to imply mere particularly a tender tc
regard to the feelings of others, which makes a
us studious to a\cid wounding them by v
jealousies and suspicions, bv peevishness or fr
fretfulaess, and by allowing trifles to ruffle oi
tiie temper and disturb the social harmony. V
Many, who are not deficient in deeds of be- hi
neVoienco or friendship, arc apt 10 iorgei < ic
how much the exercise of true kindness con- j w
sists in gentleness, meekness, and tender j
consideration for the feelings of others ; and i
it is roelandioly to obscrye how much real I
unhappiness often exists in families and in ] /
communities which would be effectually prevented
by the Christian grace of kindness.

RECIPROCAL ACTION BETWEEN THE SKIN AND a
OTHER ORGANS. . 0
l'rom Combo on Health and Mental Education. u
, In tracing the connexion between sup- f;
pressed perspiration and the production of! e,
individual diseases, we shall find that those J u
organs which possess some similarity of {c
function sympathise most closely with each it
other. Thus the skin, the bowels, the lungs, s
the liver, and the kidneys sympathise readi- n
]y, because they have all the common office a
of throwing waste matter out of the system, tl
each in a way peculiar to its own structure; tl
so that if the exhalation from the skin, for p
example, be stopped by long exposure to c
cold, the large quantity of waste which it c
was charged to excrete, and which in itself 1
is hurtful to the system, will most probably r
be thrown upon one or the other of the a- fJ
bove-namcd organs, whose function will A
-consequently become excited; and if any v
of them, from consequential or accidental a
causes, be already weaker than the rest, as li
often happens, its health will naturally fee 1
the first to suffer. In this way, the bowels t<
become irritated in one-individual, and oc- I:
casion bowel complaint; while in another n
it is the lungs which become affected, giving c
rise to catarrh or common cold, or perhaps ii
even to inflammation. When, on the other t<
hand, all these organs are in a state of vig- a
orous health, a temporary increase of func- s
inlfK nlace in them, and iho C
tfcVM | # W?V ?
system, without leading to any local disor- der;
and the skin itself speedily resumes fi
its activity, and restores the balance between o
them. F
One of the most obvious illustrat ions of this is
reciprocity of action is afforded by any couvi- s
> vial party seated in-a warm room in a cold v
evening. The heat of the room, the food v
and wine, and the excitement of the mo- t
ment, stimulate the skin, cause an afflux of h
blood to its surface, and increase in a high a
degree the flow of the insensible perspira- a
tion ; which thus, while the heat continues, c
carries off an undue share of the fluids of v
the body, and leaves the kidneys almost at a
rest. But the moment the company goes ?
into the cold external air, a sudden reversion v
of operation takes place; the cold chills a
the surface, stops the perspiration, and directs
the current of the blood towards the a
internal organs, which presently become ex- *
cited,?and, under this excitation, the kid. c
neys, lor example, will, in a few minutes sc. j
crete as much of their peculiar fluid as they j
did iu as many of tlie preceding hours.? j
The reverse of this, again, is common in t
diseases obstructing the secretion from the i
kidneys; for the perspiration from the skin s
is then altered in quantity and quality, and 1
acquires much of the peculiar smell of the f
urinary fluid.
fc
When the lungs are the weak parts, and <
their lining membrane is habitually relaxed, :
accompanied by an unusual amount of mu- i
cous secretion from its surface, cold applied J
to the skin throws the mass of the blood
previously circulating there inward upon the l
lungs, and increases that secretion to a high .
degree. Were this secretion to accumulate, <
it would soon fill up the air-cells of the ;
kings, and cause sufiocation; but to obvi- <
ate tins danger, the Creator has so constitu. ]
:ed the lungs, that any foreign body coming <
n contact with them excites the convulsive i
iflort called coughing, by which a violent <
md rapid expiration takes place, with a <
orce sufficient to hurry the foreign body
ilong with it, just as peas are discharged by j
>oys with much force through short tubes <
>y a sudden effort of blowing. Thul| a j
:hcck given to perspiration, by diminishing i
he quantity of blood previously circulating t
!>? nnfnmllv leads vcrv often to t
Ml WiU OU14l?vvy j - ~*_V
ncreased expectoration and cough, or, in \
>thor words, to common cold. t
The lungs excrete, as we shall afterward 1
ce, a large proportion of waste materials 1
rom the system : and the kidneys, the liver, i
ind tlic bowels have in so far a similar of- i
ice. In consequence of this alliance with t
he skin, these parts ore more intimately, s
onn.cted with each other in healthy and r
liseased action than* with other organs.? i
Jut it is a genefal law, that wherever an or- j
<au is unusually delicate, it will be more ca-* t
ily affected by any cause of disease than i
hose which are sound. So that, if the 2
icrvouS) system, for. example, be weaker i
hun other.parts, a chili will be more apt to *
isturb its health than that of tire lungs,
?'bich are supposed in this instance to be c
onstitutionally stronger; or, if the muscu- t
ir aud fibrous organizations be unusually v
usceptiblo of disturbance, either from pre- t
ious illness or from natural predisposition,
bey will be the first to suffer, and rheumaism
wiil ensue; nnd soon. And hence
be-utility to the physician of an intimate
cquaintaucc with the previous habits and
onstitutions of his patients, and the advan- I
ige of adapting the remedies to the nature 2
f the cause, when it can be discovered, as c
roll as to the disease jtself. A bowel t
omplaint, lor instance, may arise from ov- c
r-eating as well as from a check to perspi- a
ition; but although* the thing to. be cured I
> the same, the means ofcure ought obvi. i
usly to be different. In the one instance, i
n emetic ok laxative to cany off the offen- c
ing cause, and in the other a* diaphcrQtic
> open the skin, will be the most rational s
nd efficacious^medies. Facts like this i
expose" the glaring ignorance and cf. >
oniery of the quack, who affirms that his s
no remedy will cure every fbrm of disease;, i
fere the public not equally ignorant .with c
imself, their credulity would ccasc to at- a
trtl to his presumption the rich field ip >

RiBAL KCOXO.lIl. t
itraduction to the current volume of the Southern F
Agriculturist by the new Editor.
The liberal patronage this journal has
:ceived tor trie last eignt years, renders its j
tility no .longer doubtful. We, therefore, I r
ssuirse its control, with the persuasion, that t
ur present endeavors to continue the work t
rill be met by .an increased degree of public (
ivor. The truth is, the Agricultural inter- ?
st is becoming of greater consideration to t
s every day. The people of Europe, and {
f the Northern and Eastern States, feeling t
s vast importance, have already established 1
ehools and professorships for its advance- t
uent, and with emulous pride have encour- ?
,ged every undertaking having for its object i
lie improvement of %iiculiural science. In c
liis enterprise our people have done com- t
aratively nothing. While, with a sedulous t
are, they have festered and cultivated every y
ithcr Science, they have suffered that of ' >
Agriculture, to sink to an ebb, from which it ?
equires our strongest efforts to raise it. 1
LT.e trfck, however, is not an impossible one. 1
Vo have those amongst us who have ad. 1
anced the other departments of Science to <
. successful consummation. Unfortunately, t
lowever, as much lias not been done for i
Agriculture. We have bconso long accus- f
omcd to loo? upon it as a mere mechanical ^
ihor, that, vco have in a great measure, <
iCglecied the study of those principles, which <
an alone render it intellectual and entertain- 1
jg. The result naturally is, that it ceases i
3 yield us interest, we become discouraged 1
t its pursuits, and instead of looking to our- i
elves tor a want of success, attribute the <
' !l. 2
ulurc to our lands?we proclaim incm sienie i
-the spirit of emigration seizes us, and we i
nally abandon them and seek a renovation ,
f our fortunes in the " distant West." Our <
mrposc, in this journal, shall be to admonsh
our people against such a course. We
hall endeavor to shew them, that an AH- .
rise Providence has provided us with means,
vhich only want the application of industry <
o make them permanent blessings. That, .
ie has spread out before us a soil, which if i
.ttended with judgment and skill, can yield 1
in-abundance %f most of the products of '
ither countries. That, he has favored us i
vith a population remarkable for intelligence 1
rnd virtue, and has bestowed* upon us a i
government under whoso happy influence, i
ve arc brought into commerce $nd acquaint- <
inceship with the whole civilized world. i
With a view to bring-out these resources, i
tnd to give a proper application to them,
vc have determined to spare no efforts on i
>ur part. We have, accordingly, .hud a i
>crsonal interview with some of the most
)ractical planters and farmers from different
)arts of our Southern country. Most of :
hem have promised us the aid of their expe
ience and study,-and all of them have consented
to transmit us, such agricultural information
as they may be able to collect
rom those around them. Nor sf&U our
flforts stop here. Determined to improve
ourselves, and to add to the interest of oui
readers, we shall, at suitable seasons, make
such excursions into this and the adjoining
States, as will enable us practically to learn,
what is the state of the Science throughout
the various sections of our Southern country,
[n doing so, we shall permit nothing to csjape
our notice. Our aim shaH be to present
the whole physical and intellectual^tatc
af the Science?the rural economy of out
people?the moral condition and treattnenl
rf our slaves?everv tiling in fact, which
may tend to impart interest, by a detection
af errors in our agricultural system, or the
iiscovery of improvements unknown to it.
While we feel, therefore, that a grehl

ibvious that much of our -success will de>end
upon the efforts of our friends. , Others
iround us, with a noble patriotism, arc doing

vill catch the same laudable spirit hd
hem recollect that the history of the work
las pi-oved, that national importance, anc
ve may add, national independence itself
ire based upon the resources of agriculturists
and farmers. That amid the flubtuaions
of all other interests?amid the depres
iions of all other trades, they alone, by theii
mtuml repugnance to sudden excitement
emain tlie most permanent safeguard to th<
)reser\^tion of our instiiotions and our liber

An excellent method of rendering thesi
Jurable in the ground, is' published in tin
American Eagle. It consists, 1. In peel
ing the posts, and in sawing and splitting
them if top large; 2. Iii sticking them up
under cover, at least one entire summer
and 3. In coating with hot tar, about thro
feet of the bu't ends, which fre to bq insert?
in the ground?after" which they are read;
for use. We have no'doubt the advantage
r>t* this mode of preparation will mote thai
~~ I I \ ?
remunerate for labor and expense. Ou
reasons for this belief are briefly as follows
The sap of all non-resinous trees, will fei
ment in the presence of heat and moisture
and cause the decay of the woo'd. To pre
mit this natural consequence, the first ob
ject should be, when a tree is felled, to exp
sup from the pores of the wood. ThisH
done by peeling, splitting, sawing or hewing
and oxposingthe wood to the drying influenc
of the sun, or at least of the air- The pre
cess is facilitated too by immersing the woo
in water for a time, which liquifies the saj
and favors its expulsion. And when th
#
* * , <"
r moisture has been expelled, the next object 1
> is to keep it out, by paint, tar or charring, i
[ In the mode rcccommended above, the mou- I
, turc is expelled by the peeling, sawing and i
t summer drying, and its return is prevented 1
, bv the coating of t,ir. The retention of the <
. bark upon the timber is particularly prejudi- j
. cia!, not only in preventing evaporation, but <
; alfording shelter to various species of the <
borer, which, binder its cover, carry on its 1
t depredations upon the timber. We have <
i -seen pine logs nearly destroyed in a summer ]
t by worms, where the bark had been left on,
! while those which had been peeled remained i
, uninjured. The best timber is* obtained i

^ Abolition of Slavery in the District of
s Colombia.
a Mr. Morris presented two petitions from
r Ohio, praying for the abolition of slavery in
: the-District of Columbia.
Mr. Calhoun demanded that the petitions
b should be read.
! The Secretary having read the petitions?
>- Mr. Calhoun demanded the question on
il receiving them; which was a preliminary
s question, which any member had a right to
make. He demanded it, on behalf of the
e State which he represented; he demanded
>- it, because the petitions were in themselves
d a foul slander on nearly one-half of the
), States of the "Union; he demanded it, bee
| cau^e the question involved was one over
- & ' .
which' neither this nor the other House had la
my power whatever; and that a stop might tr
be put to that* agitation which prevailed in ti
so large a section of the country; and lc
which, unless checked, would endanger the r<
existence of the Union. That the petitions h
tust read contained a gross, false, and ma!i- o
oious slander on eleven States represented tl
on this floor, there was no roan who in his c
heart could deny. This was, in itself, not c
only good, but the highest cause why these f]
petitions should not be received. Had it not tl
been the practice of the Senate to reject petitions
wiiich reflected on any individual ti
member of their body; and should they 11
who were the representatives of sovereign d
States, permit petitions to be brought there, 8
wiUully,maliciously, k most wickedly, slan. v
dering so many sovereign States of this ^
Union ? Were the States to be less pro- 1
tooted than individual members on that floor ? c
He1 demanded the question on receiving the 1
petitions, because they asked for what^vas 1
a violation of the Constitution. The ques-' *
Hon of emancipation exclusively belonged 1
to the several States. Congress had no 5
jurisdiction on tiie subject; no more in this r
District than in the State of South Carolina: *
it was a question for the individual States to {
de'termine, and not to be touched by Congress.
He himself well understood; and 1
the people of his State should understand, 1
that this was an emancipation movement. 1
Those who have moved. in it regard this
District as the weak point, llirough which 1
the first movement should he made upon J
the States. We (said Mr. C.) of the South 1
are bound to resist it. We will meet this 1
question as firmly ns if.it were the direct 1
orviari/>innfirt?i in fhp SfatfS. It '
l|UUdllUU V/t VIIIIH1V>|?W^IUI< ?- ?y _ _
is a movement which .ought to,, which must
be arrested, in Ibnbie, or the guards of the *
Constitution will give.way and be destrty?d?,
He demanded, the question on rec^viri?'the;
peti^ns, because of the agitation which 1
would result from discussing the subject;?
The danger to be apprehended was fr.pm. the
agitation of the question on that floor.* lie'
did not fear those inceijdiary publications
which were circulated abroad,^ and which
could easily be counteracted. Bat he dreaded ,
the agitation which would arise out of the.
discussion in Congress, on thasubjeet. Every
man knew that tficr^ existed a body of
men in the Northern States who*\ycre ready
to "second any insurrectionary moyement of
the blacks; and that these men w$uld be on'
the alert to turn fhese discussions to their
advantage. He dieaded the discussion in
another sense. * Tt would have a tendency
? ' * rr tttl.4
to break asunacr mis union. v? iwi cuwi
would be broughnabout by the interference
of these petitioners ? Could they expect.to
produce a change of mind in the Southern
people? No, the effect would be directly
the opposite. The more they were assail-'
ed on this point, the more closely would they
cling to their institutions. And what would
be the effect on the rising generation, but to
inspire it with odium against those whose
mistaken views and misdirected zeal menaced
the peace and security of the Southern
States. The effect must be to bring ourinstitutions
into odium. : As a lover of the
Union, he dreaded this discussion, and u$Jfr?
ed for some decided measure to arrest the1
course of the evil. There must, there shall
be some decided step, or the Southern pco.
pie never will submit. And how are wc to
treat the subject ? By receiving these petitions,
one after another, and thus tampering,
trifling, sporting with tho feelings of the

well understand the eifec^of such a course
of proceeding. It will give importance to.
their movements, and- accelerate the ends
they propose. .Nothing Can, nothing will,
stop these petitions but a-prompt and stern
rejection of them. Wc must turn them
away from our doors, regardless of what
may be done or said. If the issue must be*

Mr. Morris made a few remarks; the substance
of which was, that Congress have
no power to raeddlo iifhny way with slavO- '
ry in the States | but that in the District" of
Columbia it has primaiy and.exclusive power
of legislation, and may therefore under
the Constitution regulate or abolish slavery
in that District.
Mr. Hill moved to lay "the tvhole subject

Mr. Porter; of Louisiani, next addressed
tlic Chair in a speech of. some length. He
alluded to the former practice in both Hoa

a committee, and thus letting them
He would he willing to continue this pr&c*
tice, if the disturbers of the peace of the
country would learn a lesson to discontinue
their incendiary petitions, but so far from
this they are becoming more and mom bold.
It was evident that they now believed w&
are afraid to meet this question. They
must be undeceived; They must be taught '
at once that on this subject-ifrc are determined
neither to talie nor give quarter. <
He did not suppose that that any decla-- <
ration of Congress tVo.ukl stop the wicked
men who provoked these movements; but 1
he thought it might have a good effect upon '
the honest but misguided persons who were^ j
their dupes and instruments. A clear, decided
expression of the determination, 6h
this subject, of the National Legislature, he
could not help thinking, would liave a most
beneficial influence. o
He admitted the fight of petition, but "he
at the same time maintained that Congress
has the right to determine for itself how the
petitions are to be treated. .
Mr. Preston followed Mr. Porter. The'
following is his speech as reported in the
National Intelligencer.
I must confess that I, am somewhat surprised
at the introduction of petitions of
this character, after the occurrences of the
ist summci^whicb^nustm^
lade the Southern people extremely sensi- ^
ve on this subject. I am aware that simiur
petitions have been presented, and refersd
to the Comniittee for the District of Co*
imbia, and, as was stated by the chairman ^
f that committee two years ago, without
ic chance o f promoting any action of thatv
ommittee. To use his language, "the * jjg
ommittee room was to them the lion's den,
rom which there were no footprints to mark M
heir return."
But, sir, this course is not the proper oner
