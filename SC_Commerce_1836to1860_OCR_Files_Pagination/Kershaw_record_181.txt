THE Establishment of the COMMERCIAL
COURIER was rendered necessary by the inconvenience,
to whicfi our citizens have been subjected
or the want of a public channel of communication
which in a commercial community like Camden, is
ssentially necessary, and consequently the COUfllER
S claim on the public is such as should enmrc
a liberal patronage.
The undersigned have spared no trouble or expense
in obtaining the best workmen in order to
ender the Paper nil the advantages that it will
idinit of, and affording satisfaction to its patrons.
In political matters the Courier will take no
>art; the design being to publish a Paper adapted
o the interest of all, which could not be efFected
?y its entering into the arena of Politics?it will
?e confined principally to such matter as appertains
o Commerce, Agriculture and Amusement.
The COURIER is published every Saturday

INFORMATION WAITED!
The sympathies of a generous public, are feelingly
solicited to the following statement and enquiry.
JOSEPH B. RHAMt, of Sumter I)ist.,-near
Bradford Springs, 8. C., left an interesting!
family in December, 183t>, to seek his fortune in
the Western States. His letters were received
from Macon and Colqmbns, Ga. up to the 17th
December, 1830, from which it appears, lie was
at that time to embark for Tuscaloosa. After this
period, and up to the first ot January, 1837, letters
wore received from New Orleans, and Irom whence
he was to emlmtk as Clerk, on board a ship f war,
under command of Copt. Williams, bound for Tex*
as. Since this period, no account of hint has been
received. The apprehension of his family and
friends, are alarmingly awakened with regard to
| what is his destiny. Information, cither by private
' letter to Elen S. It home, Reynolds' Store, Sumter
I District, S C . or through public prints, will '<e
thankfullv received.
The Charleston, Columbia, and New Orleans
papers, would confer a favor on a distress d family
by publishing the above twice, in a conspicuous
place^ and se;-d their acou ts to Reynold's More.
