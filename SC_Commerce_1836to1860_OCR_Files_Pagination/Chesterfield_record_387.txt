KENDALL'S ADDRESS
To the People of the United Slates.
Our country presents a new spec tacit
fuffthe contemplation of mankind.
A candidate for the Presidency is ask
ing the suffrages of our.people, and a
the same time refuses xo answer th<
ft questions they put to him, for tlie pur
fose of satisfying themselves as. to th
principles and policy by which he wil
be governed* if ?Jectod. With his owi
consent, a committe .is interposed be
. ^ tween b*e> and 5is countrymen, not t
aid h?rn in giving frank replies to thei
reasonable inquiries, but to cut .off direc
communication, and keep his opinion
from the public. A free and intelligen
people whose pl^cious right it-is to as
. and obtain the views of every man wh
seeks their suffrages, upon every poiri
~A???nmont q r
appertaining m men pecMMUbin) ?.
bluntly told that.|hey shall Dot enjoy thi
right, but shall take -a candidate ft
the Presidency upon trust. They ar
asked to relax that "eternal vigilance,
which is truly "the price of liberty,
,a:id blindly submit themselves if not t
to a "King* who can <lo no wrong," t
a Chief Magistrate who assumes the al
titude of irresponsibility, and surrhunil
himself with ministers, even before th
crown of power has been placed on hi
head!*
The candidate was nominated by
convention, not because they considere
hrm the ablest man of their party or a
a4l qualified for the station, but mere!
because he had once bfeen a General.Having
seen the heroic Jackson in th
chair of 9tate, notwithstanding their un
cedstng denunciation of "military chiel
tains^" they weakly expected to ava
themselves, in their struggle for powei
of the same devotion and enthusiasm, b
presentmg the name of another who ha
worn tfce uniform of his country, and ai
tainedTo the same rank. They did nc
accord to the people sense enough t
discriminate between the weak andinel
ficieut chieftian, who after a series (
military blunders, fortunately for hi
country, resigned his commission in th
~ - -? '? 1 I ...L
midst o! the war, ana me reai nero wn
took it up, and closed that war in a blaz
of glory at New Orleans.
Under this fatal error, the conventioi
instead of presenting in an address c
resolutions, the principles which wool
control the administration of their car)
didate, if elected, concerted a generz
movement throughout the Union, to giv
eclat to their nomination, by a siinulta
neous shout to the glories, wlijch, afte
an oblivion of twejity five year9, are noi
for the first time discovered to^e worth
of commemoration in feats and in song
We have accordingly 9een vast assem
b!ages collected together, at great 1c
bor and cost, not to respond to an
principle, or listen to any argument, bu
to drown the voice of reason in the shoul
of revelry, and lead captive the feeling
of a people in a senseless excitement.

which he was annoyed by cavillers and cticmicf

* Hermitage,, Feb. 28, 1823. .
"Sir: 1 have had the honor to receiveyour excel
leney 's letter of the 30th mo, endorsing resolution
of the Senate of Indiana, adopted, as it appears
With a view of ascertaining my opinions oncertah
political topics.
" The respect which I entertain for the Execu
tivc and Senate of your State excludes from mj
mind the idea that an unfriendly disposition dicta
ted the interrogatories which arc proj?scd. But
will confess my regret at being forced, by this sen
tiraent, to depart in the smallest degree frdln tha
determination on which 1 have always acted. Not
sir, that I would wish to conceal my opinions oi
any political or national subject; but as they were
in various ways, promulgated in 1824, I am' ap
prehensive that my appearance before the Public
at this time, may be attributed, as has already beei
the case, to improper motives."
* >b.
I canoes, and ctffer-barrel*, through tire
> streets; the rolling of balls; and the dis~
i play of banners with unmeaning mottoes,
t doggerel rhymes and Vulgar pictures;
, the drinking of cider,* the mumbling ot
. giugerbread, and imitating the cries of
r birds and beasts, with other mummery
I and mockery, as disgraceful to the peo.
t pie, are the new means of electioneering
? by which it is vainly expected to induce
I the community to surrender itself, like
the charmed bird, to the jaws of the
i wiley serpent which stands ready to de5
vourit. By arguments like these, it is
> expected to persuade the freemen of
America to surrender their right to know
the political opinions of the candidate, and
i take him, for better or fog worse, gagged
and guarded as he is.
* To these means of influence, are added,
money without stint, abuse of official station
and privilege without restraint, and viola- j
2 tion of the laws without restraint, and vio~
lut on of the laws w:thout reserve. The
- Harrison party in Congress are leagued in
t a great electioneering Association, with its
e "executive committee," appointing subor
dinate committees throughout the Union;
e raising money by tens of thousands to sup.
I port presses, to magnify their mock hero,
A libel the Administration, and scatter delusion

it an unscrupulous and unceasing warfare

is- ment. The public business is delayed, the

rations of the Government obstructed, that
session of Congress may be protracted; thus

f* Contempt for the people lies at ll>e bot>f
torn of the whole scheme ol" electioneering,
is The Harrison party showed this contemp1,
e in presenting "a military chieftain" as their
o candidate, after liaving for years denounced
? the elevation of such men as worse for the
.country than "war, pestilence and famine,
or nny other scourge."
>r Tney show it by presenting a slmm hero
to the people, and endeavoring, to persuade
L" them that he is a real one.
They show it by asking the people to
e vote for a gagged and guarded candidate,
who "will answer tho questions of neither
T friends nor foes.
v They show it by abandoning all argument,
y and throwing principle out of the contest.
!" They show it by their rog-cabins, cider^
barrels, pitchers, canoes, balls, banners, pic~
tures, atid.parade, riot, and drunkenness; fit
y only to amuse, if they did not disgust, a
'f London populace, or a Parisian mob.
s They show it by their incessant aod monstrous
misrepresentations of the nets of
- tiie Administration, and th?*ir causeless
1 abuse of the men who compose it.

d could by such means, be induced to nban^
don her right to question candidates for offiee,
and throw herself unconditionally into
^ the arms of a president and a par'y which
has no principles, or dare not avow them?
y From this contempt of the people, springs
.** the opposition of the leaders of this party
to the extension of the right of suffrage, and
their steady attempts to corrupt it when ex^
tended. Not believing the people fit for
y self government, they will not trust them
r- w th power when they can avoid it$ and
y whenever the opportunity presents itself,
? take from them that which they posy
sess. They compel their dependants
t, to vote their will, at elections, instead of
e of their own, and so to manage their priv?
Y ate affiirs as to reward cr punish more
| humble men for the surrender or assertion
tj of the right of free suffrage. Upon the same
i. principal they do not hesitate to cheat in
I- the returns. Recall a few facts of recent
13 occurrence, and it will be seen that I do
* "them no injustice.
In 1838, the leaders.o present IIar~
rison party^had possession of the Govern
merit of Pennsylvania, in all its legislative
and executive branches. By false registries,
e and the introduction of thousands of voters
11 from abroad, they strove to elect a Givernor,
" and a majority of the House of Ry?resenta. I
h lives, but were defeated. Instead of sub'?
milling to the decision of the people, they
d determined to disregard it, and tetain po8?
I session of the Government of the State at
(wery hazard. From the county of Rhila.
cielphia, two Democratic Senators and eight (
" Representatives had been ejected, and it
s *\yas so certified by u majority of the judges
i "of election; yet though the Democratic *ha.
jority was several,hundreds, a minority of
" the judges sent a certificate to the office of
[ ihe Secre'ary of State, falsely showing that
I the Harrison con did ales had a majority.?
The change of these eight members, from
1 one side to the oliier, would give them- a
j majority of the House of Representatives.?
, Fortified by this false certificate, arid sup
ported by the Governor and a majority of
' the Senate, the Secretary of State publicly
- advised bis party to treat the (lection of
" -*N
?tzmr 1111 *.i i m i
Governor, as if it had been held* although
the Democratic candidate had a m?joriiy ol
thousands! On the meeting of the Legislature,
he sent in the false returns, and with,
hold the true ones. The Senaie immedi.
ately admitted the usurpers. When the
Democrats of the [louse resisted their in4
troduction into that body, the Harrison party
proceeded separately, in conjunction witli
the usurpers, to organize a House and
chooso [their officers. The Democratic
members d:d the same thing, in conjunction
with the true Representatives from Philadelphia
county. Hut as the Governor and
a majority of the Senate were of the Harrison
par y, all power was in their hands;
and it became evident that they intended tc
create, by arbitrary power, a majority in
the House, and set as*Je the election, uoi
only of several Senators and Representatives
but. that of Governor also!
Tuis de.-ign, more bold, considering the
people, and the age than the most daring
usurpations of Caesar. Cromwell, or Napolcon,
roused the spirit of '76; indignant mul
titu Jes poured into the capital; they organ
'Z"d a Committee of safety, and prepared fc
assert the rights of the people. Tito af
frig! ted Governor and his guilty councillors
instead of receding from their foul design
denounced the people as rebels, and deter
mined to carry out the usurpation by force
<>f arms! Troops were called ou', proved
led wrh''buckshot and ball catridges;" the
capital of the Slate resounded with the dir
of arms; and the peace of the: Common wealtl
seemed to be suspended upon a hair. Los
the militia of the State might show some re
luctance to shoot down their own friends
subvert their own rights, the Governor ha<
the audacity to request the aid of a body o
United States regulars, then in'the vicinity
and to demand of the President, the aid o
the nrmy of the Union.
What in this case, did the peojfle ask?Nothing
but the installation of their pub!i<
officers, duly and constitutionally elected bj
large majorilfs. And why did not the liar
rison proceed in their monstrous design parti
to deprive t! cm of this dearest right of free
men, to treat the election os if it had no
been held, and retain the possession of pow
| er at the point of tho bayonet?. Not. because
j they relen'c ! or repented; not because thei
were not ready for blood and carnage, t<
put down the rights of the people; becausi
two of their number, and two only, refusei
to act ojt the scne, and receding from tin
usurping House of Itepresen atives, left i
without a quorum. As bold, unprincipled
ffruJ unscrupulous as they were, they darei
not proceed when they could no longer shieh
their usurpation under constitutional forms

the same contempt for the people pei

ganization for weeks, by an attempt t

riously and confessedly, had a majorit
of the votes given at the election. Th
"broad seal" of the Governor, thoug

covering a known anil acknowledge
fraud, was held by them, more sacre
than the people's right of suffrage, an
was considered a better title to a seati
Qongress, than a majority of the people'

party there had no Governor Ritner ur

Freemen of the United States! You

you that in such a condition of things
the people of that State could hav
maintained their right to a Governoran<
Legislature of their choice, but by wadin
through rivers of blood? It was at Hai
risburg, on the very scence of the Ititne
usurpation, and by the influence of th
leaders in that desperate effort, that ill
nomination of Harrison was effected!If
elected, Ritner's advisers will -be Ivi
advisers; the profligacy and and daring
ness of that faction will be transferrei
to Washington, and their sDirit will pei

A flood of demoralization has swep
over our land, and upon some States i
rests in stagnant pools, containinatin
the atmosphere of liberty, and threater
ing death to every thing virtuous, nobl

which, having struggled in vain, by it
blandishments, its corruptions, and it
terrors, to overcome the fearless am
incorruptible man then at the head of th
General Government, turned to th
State Legislature where it found no dii
ficulty in buying up Senators by th
dozen, that the people of Pennsylvanii
j were indebted for the profligacy exhib
i ited in the atlempt to subvert their lib
erties by their sword. To means fur
nished by the same and similar institu
tions, or those directly connected witl
v
i them, if not even to the bankers of Eu- lj
r rope, are the people of the United States lt
' undoubtedly now indebted not only for e<
the depravation of morals which threat- 6.'
ens to break up the foundations of so w
5 ciety, but for a large portion of the b
' means which enable their 'Executive ir
Committee at Washington, to prosecute g
i the war against art honest and democrat- ol
I ic Administration. It was violating ^
: moral obligations, and plundering their
i own people through the bank of England '
that the British Government was enabled el
I to keep the world in arms during the ai
scenes of the French Revolution; and tf
the British party in America are profit- .41
> ing by the profligate example. Laws is
1 are violated with impunity; moral ob!L p,
t gations are scoffed at and derided; |
knavery walks the streets with a bold *
face of honesty; plunderers of the public
i and of publ ic institutions, obtain sympa
; thy and forgiveness; and the Administration,
which sternly sets its face
against these evils and their authors, is ir
- sought to be made the victim of its firm- h
> ness and integrity. n
If bad men are to be permitted to j
, overthrow it by means so profligate, and
, with motives so corrupt, what is to be
- expected, but that they will proceed to n
i aggrendisc themselves upon the ruins of 7
. our Free Government, and the enslave- v
i ment of our people. n

i, That in the practice of a rigid morality g

s Dear Sir: j |
d I have received, with great pleasure, <
e your letter communicating tbe proceedings of i
e a public meeting at Cheraw, which I hail as '<
F- an indication that South Carolina is awaken- i ''
e ing to a just appreciation of the interests of; j
1 the country and of her own most essential and j
essential interests. The only measure of the 1
present dynasty which she has ever approved,
~ has most strangely been one which experi. j
1 encc has proved to be fraught with calamity ]
1 I
> her and to the country. Of ftll portions of
ie Union, the staple States are most inter,
sted in a sound currency, and a firm and large
pstcm of credit; and yet we have joined in a
ar upon both. Our banking system has
een the soundest and the most unequivocal
i its good effects upon the prosperity of the
tate; and, as if to complete the paradoxes of
ur position* South Carolina has placed at the
?ad of her two largest and most influential
anks, two gentlemen amongst the most con~
jicuous of that party, who avow that banks
re not and cannot be made subservient to
lose purposes for Which tbey were instituted
nd are maintained. The anti-bank party
led by the Presidents of Banks. The same
cr8on3 denounce and dispense the poison; and
ie party in power who created this immense
rood of corporations, flow turn round, like
aturn, to devour their own children.
Not less extraordinary than all this* is the
jdden advocacy of every man, and every
leasure, and every principle, which our State
as denounced for years. Not less extraordiary
is the advocacy of a Missouri restrictionit
against a gentleman who wore a crown of
lartyrdom on that occasion, in the mrinte^
ar.Ce of Southern rights?who has suffered
lore than any man living, in our cause, and
rtio fought our battle in a remote region, re.
aoved from the support of sympathy, and withut
hope of reward. These positions arc, to
0 my mind, strange and unnatural.
Upon the two great questions of Southern
uterests, no politician, out of the heart of the
Southern States, is more deeply pledged
han General Harrison. On the Tariff) he is
ledged to. the compromise. On. the subjectf
Abolition, he sacrificed his political caree
1 maintaining tBe constitutional rights of the
louth. On both these points, he is preferable
? * - ? . . - it
r> the present mcumoeni;?anu i am srrong,
/ inclined, from pf&se'rtt indications, to be.
eve that they have takonsuch strong hold on
he public mind, that he will lose but two
itaies in the Union-?South Carolina and New
lampshire?ju9t enough for the Northern
aan with Southern principles: one State for
ach branch of the proposition.
When General Harrison is elected, I confi.
lently expect him to reduce, at once, all Southin
opposition to a mere faction. They wiH
lave no pretence under which to cover their
itrigiics. *

Your ob't serv't,

WAiaisoToif, May, 1840;
Mi/ Dear Sir: _
1 have received your letter communica,ing
to me the proceedings of a public meet,
ng in the Town of Oheraw. In the course
ivhicb a sense of duty forced me to pursue for
,ho last three years, I have been sustained
>nly by a settled conviction that I was right,
ind the approbation and support oT my own
:onstituents. Having the highest estimate of
ihe mtellfcence and patriotism of the people
if South Carolina, and never* for a moment
having doubted that the great mass of those
lonstitutmg the present majority in the State,
(I say nothing of the leaders, and the office
hunters, great and small,) were as sioccre in
there opinions as I was. I knew at the same
time, that threrc were influences which could
not be resisted, and I had made up my mimJ
tosubmit to a state of things which I could
not eontrol, and had not anticipated any
cheering "well done" from any quarter of the
State out of my own immediate District, You
will appreciate* then, the feelings With which
I have read the proceedings of the rneetirtg
at Cberaw. I will not attempt to describe
them. I confess to you that as highly as I
value the personal compliment to myself, }
am much more gratified to see that the enlightened
comnunity in which you live, concur
with ine in opinion; and what is unfortunate,
ly now-a-days, a much higher and a moth
rarer quality,?have the courage to say so, in
the face of an overwhelming and overbearing
majority. If every man in the State,- who
really disapproves the financial policy of the
administration, would openly say so, and go to
work, I do not doubt I bat the state of feeling j
would be speedily changed* fs evidence of
this wanting? The question was not made in
any Congressional District in the State, ex.
cept in those represented by Col. Campbell
and myself, ar d we both succeeded by immense
and greatly increased majorities. That
such would have been the esse in almost every
District m the State, if the subject had been
discussed and fairly presented to the people, I
cannot doubt. I can with truth, say that I
have scarcely ever seen one man in the State,
tfnless he was a member of the Legislature,
or some village politician who desired to be,
" *nnr\m /\( ?Vlo oMrif* rl2U88 of the
WIIU woo ill lavvi VI 111b Of
Sub-Treasury Bill; and that is admitted to be
its main feature?the only one regarded ag
worth a controversy. At this moment, if a
census were required to betaken, and wi'h.
out any influence from the politicians or the
public press, this question was put to every
voter in the State.'?suppose the Banks re.
deem their notes on demand in specie, would
you reject their Bills, and demand specie for
government dues? I do not believe that one
tenth of the State would even now, answer
in the affirmative. But it is now distinctly
avowed as one of the objeets, and the leading
one of the party, to abolish all Banks of issue
?that is, all Bank paper money. I have said
from its beginning, that this was their pur*
* ' * JAwm/1 r\n I
pose; it was denied, but lb IB uruicu iiw
longer; it is openly avowed by the acknow
ledged leaders of the party.
If there is one man in the State who 19 in
favor of this, i hayp never seen him, although
[ do not doubt that there may be maby. 1
Jon't see why every capitalist w-ho has money
?n hand?every usurer and every office-holder
whose fees and emolument are fixed hy law,
should not be, as their interests would be.pro.
fnoted precisely in proportion as every other
:lass suffered.
Amongst the strange things which we have
ately witnessed* not the least strange has
3eeh, that those who have heretofore denoun:ed
Mr. Van Buren, and has party as "corropionists
and abolitionists," now represent his
idministration as a model of republican purity,
ind himself as the specially appointed
juardian of Southern rights. It is known to
pou that Mr. Van Buren was the zealous and
itfenuous advocate of the Missouri restriction,
md that General Harrison was one of only
.hree from the non-slaveholding States who
itood op for our rights, and that he was sacriiced
for it. Suppose that an election of
President, had taken place the next yey, and
that General Harrison and Mr. Van Buren
had been the -candidates?would Mr. Vail
Buren have received ten votes in our State? 4?
He would not. Is there a statute of limits-'
tion to public gratitude? It seems so, and
that the debt is not only cancelled, but"that
services rendered U9 in time of need, requiring
the highest moral courage and involving a
sacrifice of office and preferment* constitute
an excuse for calumny and denunciation.
Mr. Van Buren* "the advocate of the force
Bill," without the change* or retraction of any
opinion, is all at once trahsformed into the
great advocate?the stay and support-of State
Rights doctrines. - He is opposed to Internal
Improvements, yet not only sanctions, but
recommends appropriations for the Cumberland
Road?and has voted without one exception
for the highest tariffs which haveever
been imposed. He, the guardian of State
rights* wlk> has proposed the two most flagrant
and daring encroachments upon them, in the
history of the country! His Bankrupt Bill*
with power over state corporations t? crush
them at will?leaving the States the power to
create, but arrogating to the Federal Government
the power instantly to destroy?and the
other, the plan approved by him of calling the
militia from the extremes of the State to be
drilled and trained by officers of the Federal
army, taking it from the States to-which the .
Constitution expressly gives it and gi ving iy? Vj
the Federal Government from which it is WithM
Laid..?Wo .h?To foawd ?iir encampment ^

sembling privates as well as officers from thelextremes
of the States to be absent thirty
dayp, equipped and transported at their owri '
expense, and drilled by officers of the Afmy of
the United States, in direct violation too of
the Constitution ? A more silly, impracticable,
or if practicable, a more oppressive* dangerous,
and unconstitutional measure, never
has been suggested. I have no idea of its ; ^
being adopted, for I do not. believe there is orie
man in Congress who would </dre to vote foi*
it. But -it serves to show (he pitiable weakness
nf those who have literally craWJeii into high
places, and the boldness with which they
dare to propose such schemes, prating all the
while, that they are lhu9 attempting to load .. ^
and oppress the people of their peculiar zeal
for their interests; and whilst attempting
such dangerous infractions of the Constitution
setting up to be regarded its exclusive gdar.diarts,

truth, that I do not believe that any other

OOXTSfrSSglOlTAL, " - Correspondence
of the Journal of Commerce.
Washinoton, Friday, May 29.
, In the Senate* this morning, a report
was made by Mr. Buchanan, from the"
Committee of Foreign Relations, of a
joint resolution authorising the Presi^
dent ef the United States to receive the
presents lately sent fronb the imaun of
Muscat, together with the lion and lion
es9 presented by the Enfrperor of MorQC^ .
co, through the Consul at Tart?ier9. By
this resolution, the President is authorised
to receive and dispose of the presents,
the proceeds to' be placed; in the'
Treasury.
Mr. Tappan did not like the idea of
the money being placed in the Treasu-'
ry, but thought it should rather be conveyed
to the magnificent donoFS in-some'
form or other.
A motion was rtadfe to lay the resolu~
tion on the table, when Mr. Buchanan
explained the necessity that existed for'
some speedy action, on the subject,'as
the horses were now kept at the^expense
of Captain Ben Hammet, of the Sufitan's
ship Sultanne. With regard to the lions,
the* Consul had done his duty strictly^?
he had refused to receive the preseBt,
informing the minister that he was precluded
by I^w from so* doing. He was
' - * r~- av
told uiey were nut iui muif uui iui
President; and while the consul Was m
the very act of writing a fetter to tliaf
effect, he was surprised^by the firing of
guns, rattling of drums, aud the move,
inents of troops, and, looking out of his
windows, found them arrayed before his
door, with the lions, which were under
the care of a captain Pasha, nephew or
the Emperor. The Consul again told
the Pasha these could not be received",,
and was answered by that officer, thatr
if he look any such message to the Em.
peror, he would lose his head, which be
was by no means disposed to do. Her
' then asked the Consul why the fresw
dent could uot receive them, and was
told that Congress would not permit it<
"Then," said he, "give them to Congress;''
and he was again answered, that
Congress was forbidden to receive presents,
by a clause of the Constitution.*
"Then who are the masters of Congress?1
said the Pasha. He was answered, *The
people.' *Then give them to yoqr Sultans!'
The Consul still refusing, the
Pasha assured him it he did not receive
them, they should be turned into the
streets; and the troops had actually de*?
parted with that view, when the Consul
agreed to receive them; and thej> were
now with him, occupying the best room
in his house, for ought he (Mr. 8.) .
knew.
The resolution was ordered to be engrossed.
