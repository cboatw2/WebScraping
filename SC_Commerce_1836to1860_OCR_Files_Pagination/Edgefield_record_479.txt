The patrons of the Mirror will learn
from the card ofthe Editor, that its publi

:as soon as the paper can he obtained from
'our manufacturer, which will probably he
.by the middle of March, the 31irror will
!be issued. The only assurance we can
:give the patrons. is that the duties devol

-executed, and we flatter ourselves that the
.typographical execution will be such as to
-render the work accelptible to its numerous
friends.
It may not be improper for us to add,
-that in consenting to become the publisiers
of the Mirror, we have prompied more by
our desire to have the wnrk sustained in

As no enterprie, however latlable, cnn

to tite Ladies for t'ir approbation which

To thc Patrons of the Augusta Mirror.
The subscriber is happy to inform the pa
nrons of the Augusta Mirror that he has af
fected an arrangement with Mlessrs. J. W.

manency of The Mirror, and encourage the
friends of our domestic Hitctratre to lend it
their patronage. The Mirror will still re
main under his editorial control and will
receive, wvhat he has not beetn able to dhe
vote to it heretofore, his undivided care and
attention, by which he hopes to retnder it
more thtan ev'er, deserving2 the encoturage
mient and support of the Southern public.
The publication of the .iirror~ will lie
resumed so soon as a supply of suitable
papar can be obtained fromt the North, af
ter which time its regular andi promttpt ap
pearatnce, and superior typographiral ex
ecution, are abnndantly watrranutd by the
ability and facilities oft he pubilishiEr<.

The Recent Case of Lynching.-Th:
Mount lolly Herald gives some particu- n
lars in relation to Jonathan D. Ayars, who f
was recently tarredland feathered in Salem C
county, for improperly treating his wife. l
He is classed with those gentlemen who in
prefer marrying a foritno to earning it. 0
le courted and married a widow lady, th
who had inherited and possessed a small fi
farm, otn which she resided, and by her in- 0
dustry and economy, obtained a good liv- dt
ing. After mnrriage. ie ruled those about v1
hitn rather Turkishly. and when his wife P
6did not thitik alike with himselfon mat- s
ters and things," he administered some P
dozen stripes with a cow skin, which lie t
provided fur the purpose. Not satisfied c
with this, he made a vendue and sold her
personal property, and intended to sell his
life estate in her hands, and leave her pen
niless, with two children by her former
husband.-Philad. Enquirer.
New BrunIcick.-The Legislature of
New Brunswick assembled at Fredericton b
on tlhe 20th flt. The following is the conl
cluding paragraph of the speech of the
Licurenant Governor:
I regret that I have it not in my power It
as vet to Coimunltlticate to you any dennite
arrangenent of the Boundary Line. Ex
parte explorations have been tmade on eith
er !id'e, preparatory to the final settlement
of that important question, and I see no -
reason to apprehend the result can be
otherwise thati favorable to British inter
esis, as well as to the contitttance of that
good understanding with the neighboring
.itates, which is the true interests, and I d
am convinced, the sincere desire of both
parties coriially to promote.
An Henorable Exaniple.-The following r
we find in the laysville Eahle. It is re
lated of Mr. Craddock, a rmemiher of the t
Keitneky Senate from the counties of ti
lardin and 31eade:
" Sir, said Mr. C. what I havesaid here
to-day has been said in a rough way, and &
if it has wounded any Senator, I hope he it
will attribue it to no unkind feelings, hui a
to my want of fle polish of education. II
Sir, ~your Superintendent of Common
Schools has said, that there are many ment
of family inl this Commonwealth, who can i
neither read nor write, and it is but true, t
my own marriage bond has my mark to it, 1j
and my soit, who tnow sits in the other
House, was a stout boy when I learned to V
write."

Senator, hot a good lawyer. What more
need be said in his praise.

is been a very active demand ftr the sta
e, and a considerable amount of business i
is been done at an advance, generally, P
I a de. per lb. on the prices current the C.,
ek previous. This activity, together U

doubt, in part to the favorable advices b
)n Liverpool, up to the 6th uhimo, re
ived in this place. on Friday evening n
si, hut the principal cause in the view of of
any persons,-is the well kcown fact, that El
ir crop will lee but a short one, and hence III
e belief, that prices must advance still
rther in the foreign market, ere long. pi
nr receipts have fallen off very much, to
iring the prst week, owing to the Unfa- b
irable condition of the roads, and the sup- h
y in 1the market is very small. The
:es made during the week, have been d
