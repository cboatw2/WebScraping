sixty-sixth anniversary of our National j
Independency was celebrated with unusual spir- j al
- it by the members and invited guests of tlie Dia- if
Icctic Club. At an catly hour in the evening, \v
they assembled at the Ilall, where an oration 1'
was pronounced by M. P. Belcher, in which the ,
orator did justice to himself and the subject, j fwhich
was, " The advantages that would result j'
from a general diffusion of knowledge.." This j
was dealt with in a masterly manner, through
fie course of which, ho touched upon the advan-' 1V
tages of Debating Societies, and concluded his ;
remarks on our National Independence and the' p
Military of our country. After the applause had h
subsided, the company sat down to well prepared
and excellent supper,1 which was not Hiarctlo:|'

nence principle, and the greatest hilarity and (
"** good feeling prevailed. *A number of sentiments |

APPROACH TO.SIXAT.As
we advanced, the valley still opened
wider and wider, with a gentle assent, and
became full of shrubs and tufts of herbs,
<liut in orr each side by loftv granite ridges
with ni<f?ed. shattered peaks, a thousand
feet high, while the face ofllurcb rose directly
before us. Both my^feompani'ihs
and myself involuntarily exclaimed, "ilere
is room enough for a large encampment.1',
Reaching the top of the ascent, or watgfe
shed, a fine broad plain lay ^.before us sfo[>ing
down gently towards the 8. 8. E. enclosed
by rugged and venerable mountains
of dark granite, stern, naked, splintered
peaks and. ridges of indescribable grandeur;
and terminated at the distance of more than
a mi le bgp. the I) old and awful front of Wore!)
rising TOFjpMldiriiluTly. in/rowoing malesiyV
frotji<t?rfer?e to fifteen hundred feet in
height. It wasa's"cen'e ofsolemn grandeur
whojjyipp^xpiTted, and Such as Wo had
never scenf'and the associations which at
the moment ruahett.u]}on our minds were 1
almost nverwh&pfng. As we went on,
new points of interest were continually
opening to our view.- ?
On the left of Jloreha dpep and narrow
valley runs uj>S. 8. E. between lofty walls -J
of rock, as if ig continuation of the,8. E. ,
corner of the plain. In this valley,"at the
distance of near a mile from*lhe plain,
slainH'thc convent; and the deep verdure
of its fruit trees and cypresses is sepn as
the traveller approaches?an oasis of beatrly
amid scenes bf the sternest desolation.
At the IS. W. corner of'the pla$ the;
rlitis also retreat, and form a recess or
open place extending from the Westward
for some distance, i'rotn called
cj-lii ja, parallel to I
l!.at in which the convent stands: and in it
is tlie deserted convent cl-Arba'in, with a
garden of olive and other fruit trees, not
visible Irnin tue plain. A lliiril garden lies t
at the mouth of el-Leja, and a fourth far-l
liter west in t!ie iccpss just mentioned.? I
'I'llo whole plain is caUcd Watlv er-Kaliali:
and the valley of the convent is known to
the Arabs as Waddy Shc'cib?that is, the
valley of Jelhro. 'i..
Still advancing, the front of Ilnreb rose
like a w ill before us; and one can approach
quite to the foot and touch the mount.
Directly before its base is the deep bed of
a torrent, by which, in the rainy season,
the waters of el Leja and the mountains!
around the recess pass down eastward
across tue plain, forming' the commencement
of Wady csh-S!ici|>li, which then issues
by.an opening through the cliffs of
the eastern mountain ? a line broad valley,
affording the only easy access to the plain
aiyl the covenant.
As we crossed the plain, our feelings
were strongly affected at finding here so
unexpectedly a spot so entirely adapted to
the script ural account of the giving of the
law. No traveller has described this plain 1
nor even mentioned it, except in a slight
and general manner; probably, because the
most have reached the convent by another
route. without passing over it; and ;>ci bans
too bec.ausd neither the highest point ofj
Sinai, (tow callcil Jabpl Mnsa ) nor the
still loftier summit o'f'Sl. Catharine, is visible
from nny part of it. The cxtretno difficjilty
and even danger of the ascent, was
well rewarded by the prospect that now
lay before tis. The whole plain er-Rrihuh
lav spread out beneath onr-feer, with the
adjacent Wadvs anil mountain?, while
W ady esh-Shfikh on the ri?jht,and the recess
on llie left, both connected with and
opening broadly from cr-Rahah, presented
;m arena which serves only to double that
of the plain.
Our conviction was strengthened that i
*3 I
here or on some one of tlie adjacent cliffs, I
was tin? spot where the Lord "descended
in fire," and proclaimed the law. Here
lay the plain where the whole congregation
might be assembled?here was the
mount that could he approached and touched,-if
not forbidden?and here the mountain
brow, where alone the lightnings and
the thick cloud would be visible, and the
thunders and the voice of the trump be
beard, when tbc Lord "came down in the
sight of all the people upon M oilnl fiiiuai." I
ji;Wegave ourselves tip to the impressions
of the awful scene; and read, with a
feeling that will never he forgotleu,..irlhe
sublime account of the transaction and the
commandments there promulgated, in the i
original words, as recorded by the great
Hebrew legislator.
