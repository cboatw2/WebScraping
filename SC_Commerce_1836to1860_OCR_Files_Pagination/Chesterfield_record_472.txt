Mississippi spoke in opposition to what he ;
deemed the Whig views of all those ques
tions?tariff, bank, distribution, &c. and
Mr. Lane of Indiana in support of them.
From all that is said, in both Houses,
it is easy to see that the distribution of the
proceeds of the public land is a measure
resolved upon, settled and fixed. The resolutions

TIIE PUBLIC LANDS.
In the Senate, to-day, Mr. Calhoun said
that the distribution of the proceeds of the
public lands had been frequently pressed
upon the consideration of the country, by
the opposition to the late administration,
and once passed Congress, but that was
at a period when there was an immense
surplus revenue in the Treasury, which
we were glad to get rid of, on any terms.
That cause no longer existed,?things
new were a very different aspect. This
measure came from the new administration,
and was moved by one of its most influential
friends, who was to form a part
of it; was supported by another who was
^ also designated as a member of the new
cabinet; and by a third gentleman (Mr.
Clay) whose influence in it would be very
great. These gentlemen would not have
introdnced it unless it was to be one of
. -r n? ir
trie icaaiug teaiures 01 uc?. uam^uu *
policy. Mr. C. said he had reviewed the
whole ground with care and attention, and
had come to the conclusion, that it would
not only be a palpable violation of the
Constitation, but would be pregnant with
the most disa trous consequence to the
country. Where was the exigency, what j
the pressing necessity for the introduction
of t lis measure ??the Treasury was i 1 a
bad condition, obliged in fact to borrow
.money ; but of that he made no complaint
?it was desirable that it should be so.
W e wcreeailed on at this time to give four j
or five millions of ourdiminished revenue,
to raise the price of stocks abroad,?to
give a further impetus to a system of speculation
that had well nigh ruined the conn-1
try, and for whose benefit ? Let those I
who advocate the in ;asure answer! flow ;
was the vaucuiniuade by this withdrawal
of revenve from lands to be supplied ??j
The Senator from Massachusetts had told
us by duties on luxuries,?on linens, and j
will;* ??Hh f Mr. c.} was as willing: as the ;
........ . y / w
Sjuator to play at that game, and would \
pu^h the duties as far on luxuries as the !
Senator, if he would take the s<arne amount
0 | l
off necessaries ;?in that procceeJing he f
would not be outdone. But lie would not j
impose duties either on lu xuries or on nc- |
ces?aries to hencfit foreign capitalists. !
He was not for paying out the lands in j
discharge of debts due abroad. He would ;
regard such a step as a grevious robbery !
of the National Treasury. What would
be the end of raising money by imposts on
silks and linens, to meet the deficiency;
^ occasioned, hut to tax the cotton and tobacco
growing regions, for the purpose of
giving relief to foreign stockholders?
What would be the effect of such a measure
on the new states ? It will be to convert
the whole public domain into the
means of squeezing as much money as {
Dossible out of the new states for the bone-!
fit of the other states. We were deceiv- i
fed by names. Would the money go to the J
people of the states individually ? no ; it;
would go to a few leading men who rule
the legislatures, to he spent in wild projects.
By this means a majority of the
states could be bought up and would govern
Congress at their pleasure. What
would be the effect on the Union itself?
Once commence the system of distribution,
and the government would soon be unable
to extricate itself. The 2G states would
be placed in an antagonist position to the
general government on any question save
those of taxation?and the majorities in
Congress would always have a thousand
local objects that would appeal to the avarice
of their constituents; the general
government would be stripped of its revenues
and left defencless.
Mr. C. went into the history of the distribution
of the surplus revenue, and read
passages from the messages of Gen. Jackson,
in 1829 and 1830, to show that it
had been recommended bv this individual,
whom he believed sincere in his opinion
that it was the best means of getting rid
fit'a surplus (accumulated to so alarming
extent) that could have been devised.
Experience had shown the error.?He
Mr. C. saw the danger, and it wa3 in fact
that first thing that bad separated him from
Gen. Jackson; but that distinguished
man acted under the belief that the Tariff
of 1828 would never be overthrown, lie
Mr. C. took a very different view, and
was convinced that, if it was continued
the whole Union would have been overwhelmed.
The Messages in relation to
the distribution of the the surplus were acceptable
to the people. Tne Governor
of N. York recommended it in his message?Pennsylvania
followed suit, the motton
was running like wild fire through
the country, and then it was that he saw
the necessity of something being done, j
J{e endeavoured to have the Constitution j
go amended as to allow a temporary (lis- !
tribut#>n for the purpose of getting rid of.
. a surplus that was swelling the currency, j
and producing universal corruption. lie
f
did not sncceed ; and at his instance, the f
distribution took the torm of a deposite 1
with the States. It the States did not c
pay it back, it would be a violation of the ?
contract?He never expected it, hut in i
case of war, when it would be found a f
valuable resource. Tnis immense sum J
was now nominally in tlio treasury; the ; a
raising of it was a foul robbery of the ! t
people, and its going back to the States j <
looked to him more like restoration than | 11
distribution. Try the system of distri- *
button of tho revenue (said Mr. C.) (
when you will, and ruin will follow ;? t
either the Government would be destroy. 1
ed, or drop in pieces from its own corrup- 1
tiori. *
The consolidated system had vanished r
like the baseless fabric of a vision ;? s
the Nat. Bank,?the funding system, the 1
protective Tariff,?-and the great Ameri- (
can system, all have gone, never more to i s
be restored, as he most ardently hoped, j f
He thought, if the new administration
would reform abuses,?bring the expend!,
tures of the government down to the re- r
ceipts,?and exert a rigid economy,?it g
? -? i /?i? z _
would claim the connuence 011 te peopie ; j
and whole generations ofpro-pcrity would j j1
follow.
Mr. Calhoun's argument against the
o o
constitutionality of the measure, was that i
the lands were held bv the general gov- 1
eminent in trust for the States as a common
fund, and that the general govern- f
meat had no right to distribute their com- I
mon property. The lands ceded by Vlr- 1
ginia were expressly given to" the Uni- ^
ted States in Congress assembled ?" for
certain purposes. II ) contended, in fine, <]
that the lands belonged to the United 1
States in their aggregate capacity, and J
not to the individual States.
Mr. Webster said, the ardent tempera- |,
ment of the Senator fromS. C. led him t
to attach evil consequences to the mea
sure of distributing the proceeds of the
public lands, that had no existence. He J c
?' 1- tltai u'lioti tlir> I

was fairly considered instead of li
being revolutionary or, destructive, it jj
would be found eminently conservative !
?instead of irritating or sxasperating, it ?
would b.i found healing in its tendency ;? C
and instead of doing harm to any Stafc, , c
would be of great benefit to the people of ^
the whole U. States. With regard to its 8
being a leading measure of ths next Ad- jg
ministration, he cou'd only say for himself a
that he bad no knowledge of Gen. liarrison's
sentiments, a id had never had ary ^
conversation with him on the s lhjcct. So v
far as lie was concerned, it would be re- ?i
me inhered that he had expressed a wish 1
that it might not l>e brought forward un- c
O P
til the next session, when those who would c
occupy the scats, would bring fresher ex- r
press ions of public feeling. It was well |i
known that the distribution of the public lJ
lands had become a subject of general l
discussion, and, from what was seen | ?
throughout the country, it was a fa- j t
vorite measure with a great majority of i 1'
the people. If we open our eyes to : ^
things arou i l us, said Mr. W., what do L,
we see ? States expressing their opinions I &
in favor of the measure, almost with add- j
grec of perfect unanimity, and without j
regard to party lines. Therefore it was a ; '
subject wiiicli Congress must act on. It J ^
had been much discussed, for years, in \li
the Northern, Southern, Ivis'.ern, and ! ^
W< stern St itc>, and had onej passed the ,
* * J V
Senate by a decisive vote ; and t ie ' ^
other branch by a m ajorit y of more than j
two-tliirJs, and yet Cut bill wis pocketed ! j
He oelicved it to b; well known to Sena- ; ^
tors within those walls, that if, instead of j j
giving it that kind of death, the President 1
had returned it with his objections, it \
would have received the constitutional j:i
majority. Mr. Webster went on, at great i j,
length to contend that the constitutional ; v
power was as clearly within the instru- j i
ment, as the power to declare war, or any J
other express grant. Without following 11
either of these distinguished men through {
their profound arguments on constitution- n
al power, I must refer you to their speech- a
es, when properly reported. Mr. W. said 8
he never could get gentleman who ad- j,
vocated State rights so zealously, to un- s
derstand any thing about the sacrifices c
made by the maritime States to the Union,
in giving up their right to tax im- J
ports;?this was giving up their whole u
power to raise revenue, to the general v
government. There was Rhode Island v
for instance, with the finest harbor |11
in the world,?a small population, and t
with small expenses?and by putting her v
duties at a lower rate than those of the I
other States, could have enriched her *
whole population, These States had par- f
ted with all these rights over the subject; <]
?had given up their privileges for the jj
general good. Mr. W. went on to show that 1
of all modes of collecting reuonuc? this J
by the Custom (louse was the most safe, s,
as well as the most convenient. He ar- t
gucd, with great force, against the prin- b
ciples of cession and reduction ; the latter
of which he said consisted in giving
anv body one half, that would come and j b
buy the other. The States had a right to de- j
maod ol the Ijoverntnent a relinquishment of r
the revenue from the tax< s, in time of peace. 1
The guvi.-rement, by going to the custom houje a
could raise wlj ?t revenue it required, ami give I
up the proceeds of the lands to the States, j
He was so ry to heor the SenaW from Sou' h J
Garoiina say he would not tax luxuries to make j
up th* deficit of rive mi'lions to pay the bonds
of the Spates ; was tired of hearing sneers J
at the States and their engagement*. It was
time to speak, like statesmen, like men of honor,
of niorah on the eubj"CtIte had heard
too much, in and out o( this body, of theinab.
ility and the unwillingness of the States to a
pay their debts ; that British gold had effected 1
a change in the politics of the country for thy 1
>urp >se of gel ting the government to assume" <
he State debts. &c. He repelled the idea j
>1 assumption of the State debts;?he should
ipjose it here and elsewhere ; but the char- j
icter of the country was suffering froin the ,
emarks made in the Senate and in the news"
lapers in relation to the debis of the Stat**. *
t was but the other night, while sitting by t
ii- own fireside, be felt limn hated, on reading (
irticles in the leading journals of England and ?.
he continent, quoting extracts from the offici- ,
ial organ of the government, which went to t
i'iow that the States nevtr meant to comply
villi their obligations. He said that any man {
uat would at all endeavor to impair the credit k
if the States hy stating that they were not t
lound to liqu date their debts, was unworthy \
he name of American, and was an enemy to r
lie fair fame of his country.
The debate was continued until after 4 P.
it. I never 6aw Mr. \Vebster more excited
han lie was while talking of the attempts to
neer down the credit of the States, and dtir- s
ng portions of his speech he was more than \
isually eloquent;?so much so in fact as to t
licit one involuntary burst of applause, which (
cemed so general as not to admit of rebuke, j
or the g tileries and lobbies both partook of it.
