ADVENTURES OF TWO SEAMEN.
Every one has road the story of Robinson
Crusoe. .The following is the true
story,. which served as a foundation for
that romance.
During the war for the succession of
A S^ain, a man named Woods Rogers was
ordered by the British government to tako
the command of two vessels, and make a
cruise for the purpose of pillage upon the
high seas. Rogers left Bristol the 2d of
August, 1708. He doubled Capo Horn
and touched at"no land until his arrival at
Juan Fernandez, whoncc the boat brought j
off to him a quantity of lobsters, and a
man clothed in goatskin, who seemed
. more savage than even the wild beasts
themselves. i
The climate in the island of Juan Fer- j
na;r It-z is so mild, that the trees retaio
their verdure during the whole year.
Thereare but two winter months, June
and July, and even then the frostsarebut
slight, but there are often heavy rai.is.
The summer heat is equable and moderate,
and there arc very few storms. Juan
Fernandez, whose name the island bears,
left sonre goats there, and the island is now
filled with these animals.
This man, the only one found on* the
Island, had forgotten how to talk, from
long disuse. They offered him brandy,
which he refused, having been so long accustomed
to drink onlypuro water; and
it was a long time beforo ho could be pre.
vailed upon to taste cooked food.
When he was able once more to speak
he related his history ns follows:?
. " My name is Alexander Selkirk; I wa9
hpru at Largo, in the province of Fife, in
Scotland. > I wa9 bred to the sea, and
was once left on this island, in conse......
f ? nn Knard which OC.
que Htc ui a ui^jjuib ??u ? ?
curred between me and the captain.
Captain Stradiingtvas well acquainted
with the nature of the island; he had left
two sailors theto once before, who re.
muined there six months, until the return
of the vessel.
As the ship pushed off, leaving me alone,
I made various signs and signals,
hoping that the captain would repent of
his cruelty, but in vain.
I considered myself then as a hundred
times more unfortunate than those who
abandoned me; but I was mistaken ; for
not long afterwards, the vessel was overtaken
*by a tempest, in which nearly oil
on board perished.
During my stay in Juan Fernandez, 1
have often seen ships pass; but none
ever stopped except two. With what
joy did I behold once more some of my
own specie's! but bow miserably was I
mistaken in my hopes ! These men were
Spaniards, with whom we wero at war ;
upon hearing my history they refused to
i n 1 i
take me on board their ship, ana nrea ni
rne, obliging me to retreat into the woods,
where I climbed up a tree and awaited
their departure ns anxiously as I had before
looked for their afrival. 'V
Captain Stradiir.g had allowed mc noth.
ing but my clothes, my bed, my gun, a
pound of powder, some tobacco, a hatchet,
h knife, and a kettle. During the first
tew days I could not rouse myself from
the deepest melancholy, from which I
was only awakened at last by the necessi.
ty of providing for my sustenance.
I began by constructing two little huts
of stakes and twigs covered with goat
skins, in one of which I proposed to sleep,
and the other was to be my kitchen.
1 was fortunate enough to strike a light,
which was useful to cook my food. I
was in want of something with which to
catch some fish, of which there was a
iihnndnnrn ; hut I was able to obtain
,
in their stead <^reat numbers of crabs.
' / ~ _
But these would not do for ever. I
was at ft loss how to proctiro any other
food. My powder was all gone, and I
had no dog to follow the goats; but necessity
is the mother of invention ; I chased
the goafs myself, and soon became so
agile and swift of foot as to he able to
catch enough for all my wants. I have
killed as many as 500, and marked as
many moro on the ear. ' "
[This account has since been verified.
Admiral Anson's fleet, 33 years afterwards,
found in Juan Fernandez, an old
g?>ai, whose ear was marked as Alexander
Selkirk described.].
My agility had once very nearly cost
me my life. I was pursuing a goat with,
out heeding whither I directed mv steps,
when I fell over a rock, and remained
insensible tor some hours. When I re.
covered invself 1 found the goat dead tin.
dor me; I diagg?;d myself with some d?ff?.
culty back to niy cabin, where I was
obliged to remain for ten days.
Custom taught me talive without hread
or suit, i found some excellent turnips,
wr?wn hv tha oreiv of some shin, and cov
?' " -J - I
tring several acres of ground.
My clot lies and my shoes wore out
verv.soon ; but my feet hecaitie so harden.
ened by long exercise over briars and
stones, that 1 suffered no inconvenience
from going barefoot. When I got over
my grief, I amused myself by cutting
my name on the trees. Some rats, escaped
from the vessels, had multiplied
prodigiously, and gave me a great deal of
trouble ; I tamed some cats by feeding
them, and thus succeeded in diminishing
this difficulty.
I made myself a jacket and a enp of
goat-skin, sewed together with bits of
skin for thread, and a nail tor a needle.
In this manner I lived for several years,
when at last one day I perceived the I
English flag, and by the large fire which !
] lighted, I succeeded in attracting tho
attention of tho veast-1 which came to my
deliverance."
Some yetus afterwards, in 1723, an
English seaman named Philip Ashton,
fr??,n tho hnndn of ntratejj and
? - '
lived for more than a year in a de>ert island
in the Bay of Honduras Whilst
lite pirates were taking in water he made
his escape and cotieialerl hiinselfiu the
V * ,
brushwood until the vessel had departed. i
" All that I possessed wasa pair of pan- r
taloons anda cap," says Ashton. * Lhad ?.
no shoes, nor stockings; not a knife, nor {
even a stick. Nevertheless, I considered ,
myself fortunate to have changed my |
condition?for solitude in'a desert island {
is at all times preferable to the cruelties ^
practised in a pirate ship.
" My lirst carc was to explore the is !
land ; it was about t<-n miles long, entirely 1
uninhabited, except by birds and beasts, I
and covered with bushes bearing various I
, O
sorts of berries and-fruit* I dug in the '
snnrl nnd obtained some tortoise.ecss. Ij
had nothing to do but to wander up and j
down the island all day ; but before long j j
the mosquitoes became so dreadfully nn-ii
i noying that I swam to a smaller island, h
at the distance of a stone-throw, where I!
took up my abode.
* 1 was in the habit of swimming '
backwards arid forwards between the is.
lands; but these excursions were notun*
accompanied with great danger from the
sharks. Once just as I reached the shore
I received a violent blow from one of
these creatures. The shallowness of the
water prevented bun from turning round
i to seize me.
" I suffered much from the want of
; shoes. The gravelly soil wounded my
\ feet dreadfully ; I would sit sometimes for
hours, unable to walk, and shedding tears
! for the pain I was in on this account.
"Sometimes I have passed a whole
day, leaning against a tree, with my eyes
fixed on the ocean, fearful of losing a moment,
in iny desire of beholding a ship.
"The rainy season was very distressing
to me, as mv attempts to strike fire
were ahfays unavailing. At last deli v.
crance came in the form of a fleet from
Jamaica, which stopped to take in water.
" The sloop which received me was
commanded by Captain Dove, a native
! of Salem, with whom I had been former'
ly acquainted. I was kindly treated by
him, and after a prosperous .voyage we
arrived at the port of Salem, two years,
ten months, and fifteen days after I fell
into the power of the pirates. I returned
to my father's hotisr, and my family
' looked upon mc as one riso.T from the j
dead."
Young People's Book.
American Wonders.-t A Southern
paper in speaking of this subject, says :
"* Two.of the greatest natural curiosities
in the world are to be found within the :
United States, and are yet scarcely known j
j to tho best informed iof geographers' and
naturalists. The one is n very beautiful
waterfall in Franklin County, in the Slate
! of Georgia ; the other is a stupendous
| precipice in Pendleton di>trict, South
j Carolina. The Tucco fall is much highj
# O
; er than the falls of Niagara*.?The column
of water is propelled beautifully over u
perpendicular rock, and when the stream
is full, it paiic^ down the rock without
} being broken.
j The Table Mountain, in Pendleton
! district, South Carolina, is an awful pre!
cipicc of nine hundred feet. Very few
persons who have once cast glimpse into
the almost boundless abyss, can ever again
exercise sufficient fortitude to approach
the margin of the chasm : almost every
one looking over involuntarily falls to

sures of caution and security that have;
always been deemed indispensable to safe j
indulgence to the curiosity of the visitor |
' and the spectator. Every ono on proceed, j
j ing to the spot whence it is usual to gaze j
| ^ver the wonderful deep, has in his or her
i imagination n limitation, graduated by
reference to distances with which the
i eye has been familiar; but in a moment,
' eternity us it were, is presonted to the as:
tonished senses, and the observer is in.
! stantly overwhelmed. He soon recovers
from the first surprise, and i i a wild delirium
surveys a sceno which foV a time
he is unablo to define by description or
| limitation."
i Singular Ingenuity and Skill.?'
j As an illustration of the nicety and skill
i displayed in some of the articles made by
! Boulton, the following anecdote is rein.
! r'-V <->':
| Ho visited France on a certain occasion,
for the purpose of attending a mechanics'
fair that was tp take place, at
which ho begged to be allowed to exhibit
a needle of his own making, at the same
time submitting it to the examiners of
works intended for this public display,
who, one and all, pronounced it to be,
though well shaped and finely polished,
1 1 - ? - ^ '' ? n/1 rirvt r 11 xr
J OUl a " UOII1IIIUII liccuir, uuu nui liming
jOfappcaring among (lie splendid and ingenious
improvements and inventions
that usually graced the fair.
"Gentlemen," observed Mr. Bnulton,
? my needle is well worthy of appearance
among your promised novelties.
Only allow it to be exhibited with them :
now, and l*will afterwards show you the
icasorwwhy." j
An unwilling assent to this request was
! finally obtained ; but when the fair closed
i and the prizes were to be awarded, the
! arbitrators triumphantly asked, ?* where
| was Mr. Boulton's needle, and what were
; the striking merits which every one failed ;
! to discover V* Thereupon, Mr. Boulton >i
again prosentcd it for their inspection,
with a magnifying glass, begging them
to state whether thev observed roughness
or wringle on its surface. The umpires <
reiurneu ir, saying, rar irom u ; iissoie
merit seems to lie in its exquisite polish." .
? Behold, then," said this ingenious man,
'its itnd iseoverahle merit ; and while !
prove to you that I have mad# no vatrr< *
boast of its claims to your uttcnti-jn, \ ?.?ti |
vill loarn perhaps, not to judge so readily
igain by mere exterior." He then unicrcwcd
the needle, when another appeared
of exquisite workmanship, and, to the
istonished eyes of the Frenchmen, about
lalfa dozen beautiful needles were thus
urned out, neatly and curiously packed
ivithinench other f a miracle of art that
seems to rival all we ever read of?a truly
multum in parvo ! Mr. Boulton trium.
)hed in his turn, and carried off the
arize which his delicate workmanship so
richly deserved.

have no doubt of their hearty support. It ic
the work of all work* on practical agriculture
~the most scientific, clear, and ctmpreheri*
ive, France has long excelled in profitable
farming. This is the source of her wealth.
England is rich by coals and commerce. Her
| agriculture iVsplendid, but sometimes costs
more than it comes to. Those who have
fortunes to spend may buy the vast works of
Marshall, Dickson Arthur Young, Loudon,
&c., but thofe who wish to get a fortune out
of the soil will find the French writers better
able to show thein the way. The excellence
of French elementary works is well known to
all teachers. For centuries, the Afaison
Rustique has been, in Franco, the standard
elementary work?the spelling book and
grammar of farming. The present edition for
J " the nineteenth century," has be.1i re^writ|
ten and brought tip with the "march of mind,"
by sixty of the ablest "agronomea" of France.
It lias all the light of the latest improvements,
| not only in Frauce, but in aty Europe.
William Cobbet, one of the most successful
farmers both in England and America, who
wrote the best style and the best French
grammer that ever was, valued the Maison

farming, but us a means of educating bis
children. He was his own fchoolmaster. In
winter evenings his family resolved itself into
a school, and ho thus speaks of the use then
made of this work.*-?# ' *
* Our book of never failing resource was I
the French Maison Rusyque. or Farm House, j
which, it is said, wv<the book tlwt first temp. {
ted Dugnosnois (I think that was his natnc,);
(he famous physician in the reign of Louis
XIV., to learn to read. Here are all the fourlegged
animals, from the horse down to the
mouse, portraits and all; all the birds, reptiles,
insect?; aIIthe modes of rearing managing,
and using the tame ones, and of destroying
those that, are mischievous; all the varions
traps, springs, nets;all the labors of the field
and garden exhibited, as well as the rest, in
p|atcs; and there was I, in any leisure moj
ments. to join this inquisitive group, to read
j the French, and tell thein what it meaned in
i English, when the picture did not sufficiently
explain ilself. I never have been without a
copy of this book for forty years, except during
the time that / was fleeing from the dungeons
of Castlereagh and Sidmouth, in 1817, and
when 1 got to Long J-land, the first book I i
bought was another A/aison Rusiique."?Ad.
