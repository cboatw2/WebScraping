Can you induce that man, thus blinded and 1
enslaved by the 'waiting heresy,' to go to '
work alone, with his own daily life, with no
S- ... oilier sympathy and aid than what he d(s j
rives from Heaven? .Can you make him j1
feel his obligations never to be weary in well j
doing, whatever others may do or say?? ,

carrying on the work or warfare of Chris- '

waiting heresy has Christian character. ;

PRAYER.Xs^lUTUAL"BAROME. j
TER. ;;
When we awake out of sleep our wants '
il>cgin ; and our desires are stirred up for j |
the supply of them. Few things mark spirit- j
mil iife more distinctly tiiaa the earnest desire j 1
of the heart af;er spiritual blessings. When j,
a Christian awakes to life then the breath |
of prayer proves that life. We may say of!
every worldly man, he knows not real com- ;
inunion with God in daily praver. We j'
may say of every Christian,44 he"/>raveh."
This is indeed the spiritual barometer of!
the soul. Whatever outward storms, what-'
ever clouds and darkness may surround j
him, if the barometer of prayer be steadily!
rising, his soul is on the way to brighter and
fairer, and happier days. My brethren, i
what are your prayers ! What can yourclosets

forward, entering on his lauors, and pursues
them through the day. The Christian, too,
has n great work, he " labors not for the
M l lit that perisheth. but for the meat that
endureth to eternal life, which the Son of
Man giveth." And O what exertion is here
requisite ! Look at the racer, how he
strains eve 17 nerve ; book at thp wrestler,
how all his muscular strength is required ;
look at the warrior does he sloep in all the
energies of the conflict? We run, we
wrestle, we fight for life and salvation ; we
contend not for'incorruptible but for an
ncorruptible crown/' Every thing is at
stake : we have mighty enemies, we are

Almighty Helper. It is his grace alone,
hat raises us from our falls, preserves us
roni lacing completely overthrown, and upio!ds
us still, and enables us to go on,' faint,

bit that religion called for all our efforts,
hat it was a work wrought in us by the
nighty power of God, and manifesting iticlf
in ail good works to man, you know not

A HAPPY MOTHER.
The mother ofjhe late Rev. John Newton
who from a bold blasphemer, was convcred
to God, and became eminent for
usefulness in the ministry, has often been
mentioned as an example to encourage
Christian mothers to be faithful in the
instructions of their children. The exampie
teachers more than has been drawn
from it. The record of it made by Newton
himself introduces us to a happy
mother; to ono who found pleasure as well
as duty in teaching her infant "the great
truths of religion. "She made i:," (says
Newton) "the chief business and pleasure
of her life to instruct me, and bring me up
in the.nuture and adomination of the Lord.
1 have been told that from my birth, she
had, in her mind devoted me to the ministry,
and that, had she lived till I was of
a proper age, I was to have been sent to
St. Andrews, in Scotland, to be educated.
Uutlhc Lord had appointed otherwise.?
Mv mother died before I w as seven vears
old."
This mother was a successful teacher.
ler son says**When 1 was lour years old 1
could read, hard names excepted, as well
is I can now, and could like wise repeat
die answers to the questions in the Assembly's
Short Cathchism, with the proofs;
ind all Dr. Watts' Shorter Catechism, and
ids Childrens Hvmns." Lot mothers seek
irid find their pleasure in giving such initructions,
and thoy will generally be
successful. Where is the child of four
years in these days, that can repeat the
whole of the Shorter Catechism with the
proofs? Many mothers are doing vistuously,
but do tbev excel the mother of Newton?
TI1E UNION OF GOOD MEN IN
HEAVEN.
If the mere conception of the re-union
of good men in a future state, infused a
momentary rapture in the mind of Tully ;
if an airy speculation for there is reason to
fear it had little hold on his convictions,
could inspire him with such delight, what
may we be expected to feel, who are assured
of such an event by the true sayings
of God? How sIhduIJ we rejoice in the prospect,
the certainity, rather of spending a
blissful eternity with those whom we loved
on earth, of seeing them emerge from
tiie ruins of the tomb, and the deeper ruins
ol the fall, not only uninjured, but refined
and perfected " with pv*?rv wined
i
! away from their eyes," standing before the
throne of God and the Lamb,44 in white
others, and palms in their hands, crying
with a loud voice, salvation to God thatsitteth
upon the throne,- and to the Lamb
forever and ever." What delight will it
afford to renew the sweet counsel we have
taken together to recount the toils of combat
and the labor of the way, and to approach
not the house?but the throne of
God in company, in order to join the symphonies
of heavenly voices and lose ourselves
amidst the splendor and fruitions of
the beatific vision.
To that state all the pious on earth are
tending, and if there is a law from whoso
operations none are exempt, which irrcsis
tioiy consigns their bodies to darkness and
to dust, there is another not less certain or
less powerful, which conducts their spirits
to the abodes of bliss, to the bosom of their
Father and their God. The wheels of
nature are not made to roll backward every
thing presses on towards eternity ; from
the birth of time an impetuous current has
set in, which bears all the sons of men to
an interminable ocean. Meadwhile heav
cn is attracting to itself?whatever is con
% *

by the spoils of eaith and collecting
within its capacious bosom whatever is
j pure, permanent and divine, leaving nolhs

THE MISSIONARY SPIRIT IN HARTFORD.
The annual collections in this ci y, in
behalf of the American Hoard, are in progress,
and the friends of missions will
rejoice to learn that they already amount
to between 89,000 and $10,000. The
collectors are confident, that when the collections
arc fully made up, the amount
for this year will exceed $10,000. Many
are expecting their call whom they have
not yet found it practicable to see, and
are prepared to meet it, and will be disappointed
if they do not have opportunity to
do it. It is the intention of the collectors
to carry the invitation to aid the operations
of the Board in this emergency through
the city, and we doubt not that their
zealous labors will be crowned with still
further success. We are informed lhat in
past years the amount has rarely, if ever

that he was nearly drunk already,
complied with his wishes, ile drank if,
and went his way.?Not long after his
! departure he was met by a man, who found
him lying on his sled upon his back, totally
helpless, and nearly frozen to death.
Ho contrived to turn his oxen about and
drive thecijtack to my house. We carried
him in and worked at him until near
nine o'clock in the evening, before be became
perfectly recovered. Indeed, a little
more and he would have died on oui
hands. After he had recovered he insis j
ted on going home, which was a consideri
ble distance, as his family would be much
! concerned about him. So L let him dej
part, sending my hired man to see him
! safe over the river. But for all this kindi
ncss he never offered to pay one cent, noi

poison, and he have been subjected to ai
arrest for man slaughter, if not for murder
And how do you think this pious tavern
keeper justified himself in this case'

VIEWS OF TEXAS.
FROM TIIE LOUISVILLE JOURNAL.
We take great pleasure in publishing
the following communication from the
Hon James Love upon the state of affair it
j Texas. Mr. L. is well known as having
I fhrmprlv been a distinguished member o
Congress from Kentucky.?He ha* jus
returned from Texas, where he has ;hat
! every opportunity of judging correctly o
i the condition of that country, and his ok
f pressed opinions, we are certain, will In
| received by the public with great defer
ence. His strong descriptions do no mon
than justice to the resources and the pros
pects of the young Republic.
To the Edi.ors of the Louisville Journal
i Ge>tlejian : Havingjust returned fron
a visit to Texas, I have thought a shor
statement of the situation of affairs in i
country that at present occupies so inncl
attention, might not be uninteresting t<
your readers.
The two Houses of Congress have jus
closed their session, and have passed man;
' laws calculated greatly to benefit the conn
; I tr-V*
They have passed an act loving dune
,' on importations of fore't:u goods and di
exceeded 5*2,50U.
This increase of subscriptions at a time
of general depression in business, indicates
an increase of the missionary spirit, and a
determination, on the part of the friends
of the cause, to sustain it in any exigency.
The friends of missions will extensively
regard the pressure as a test of principle
- in this matter, and if thev abide it as the
i citizens of Hartford have done, and are
! doing, no missionaries, ready to embark,
. will long be detained, and any curtailent
of the operations of the Board, at the different
stations, will be prevented. We
hope this may be the result on an extended
scale, and doubt not it. is just that
improvement of the pressure which the
Saviour designed his followers should make
to the increase of their spiritual friches,
and to the furtherance of his glorious cause
-in the world.?Harlford Wachman,
TEMPERANCE.
AN IMPORTANT QUESTION.
The following facts were sent us bv a
worthy and highly respectable minister of
the Methodist Episcopal church?and we
hope the alarming, truths, with the natural
and necessary inferences, will produce
abiding conviction in the bosom of every
reader, that it is not to license men to do such
outrageous wrongs.

Wh) is most to be blamed, he who sells
the first or the last poison to the drunkard,
or are both guilty alike 1

; No fears are entertained at present of 1
t an invasion by Mexico. If the situation
t of her affairs at home justified her in niak- c
1 ing the attempt there would not exist the c
i most remote prospect of success. The c
! situation of Texas makes it the most easy t
. country in the world to defend, and tile I
I present population is more than sufficient c
? to repel any force Mexico can bring into <
1 the field. The Mexicans are a degraded, c
. | servile race, vastly inferior in physical <
- i power ia the Anglo American and only <
? I take tbo field when compelled to' do so t
} by some military despot. They arc in 1
s j fact slaves upon the estate on which ihey. g
s i reside, and, however popular the war I
i | against Texas may be in Mexico, they \
I will never willingly come to lexas as ?
r invaders. The terrible lesson taughtiliem J
, at San Jacinto willlong be remembered, ?
The volunteer regiment has been tur;
loughed until fall, because, at present, i
t the country lias no use for its services. ?
t The regiment of regulars and the moun. j
. ted rangers still remain in service and <
} are more tffin sufficient for all the wants i
j of the country. From what I observed, ;
. I have no doubt it is the intention of the j
I Government to invade Mexico next fall, if i
. neace should not be made. Thev will at i
j isast take Metamoras, and occupy all the i
j country on the Rio Grande. Policy re- I
" j quires thai they should break up all the set- |
j tlements on that river, that the Mexicans I
s j may no longer have a point upon which I
' 1 they can concentrate and invade thecoun* <
" ! try at their pleasure. . .<
' * The militia of the country are in a state s
' | of efficient organization. .And every one <
, in Texas considers himself a soldier in 1
) i case of invasion.* The victors of Santa
| Anna are yet there, and more than three- I
* j fourths of them were the citizens, proper j
[ of Texas. - . <
' i The people and army have the fullest <
' | confidence in their commanders Generals <
Johnson and Houston, who, as officers of I
j science, will bear favorable comparison c
1 j with those of any service. With the officers ; i
i i under their command, the enemy they have
. ! to contend with the result cannot'be doubt- t
J lul. ?
p The Indians on the frontiers have been t
somewhat troublesome of late, acting no ]
doubt under the instigation of Mexico, t
? * * / 1 w
j Many ot them have been Known or rate s
j to have visited Meta moras. 'They have <
; committed some few murders and stolen <
some properly, but no party has been seen I
of greater force than fifteen or twenty. A !
force has been orgauized to chastise them, i
and, before this,1 have no doubt they have i
been punished for their outrages. The |
hostile Indians are undoubtedly those <
which have been removed from the United |
States, and justice requires that this Government
should restrain them from commit- \
ting depredation on her neighbors. ;
There is no truth whatever in the report j
that the Camanches were imbodied in <
force on the frontiers. They always have '
been, and still are friendly to the Texians ; |
but certain deadly hostility towards the i
Mexicans. They kill them whenever and (
wherever they meet. It is an q!<1 nation- |
?i al quarrel and cannot be appeased. <
1 Wharton the Minister from Texas to j

* tamoras, and denied all communication ]
J with his friends, yet the Texian authori- i
? tics have released all the .officers they had <
s j as prisoners, and I believe, without condi- <
11 tions. The rigorous treatment Wharton i
" ! has received is a poor return for the hu!
manity and generosity shown to them.

I The country is rapidly improving, and
t | villages are springing up in every direction.
v i The city of Houston was located, I think
- | in January last. It is the seat of Governmentj
| situated at the head of tide water on Bull- ]
s ! a!o Bayou. It already has a population of' I
:no'-" than 400.' It hava state bouse, v?v~ j 1

ral extensive taverns, store, &c. with its
!ue proportion of lawyers, physicians and

good society. Buffalo Bayou afford *

The fertility of the soil,; the salubrity
if the climate, and the picturesque beauty
>f the country are u ithout a parallel in this
ir any othor region. It is the only counry
1 know where plaming and grazing can *
)c successfully united. Horses, cattle, >
md hogs remain fat throughout the seasons,
tnd can be produced to any extent. General
Felix Houston stated to me that he
rommanded 500 men who were stationed ; ,
>n the Sau Antonio and Nucc? rivers, da- ' *
ing the summer months their only %
bod being fresh beef, roasting ears, and
papes. He did not lose a man, and had " >. \jjL

Cotton and sugar can be grown to much 0 . ;
greater advantage than in Louisiana or V' - s
Mississippi, and will produce more to the
icre, with less labor.
The people of Texas feci themselves
dentified with the United Slates. They
ire of the same blood, tlie same principles,
md the same religion. The United States
Government should be wise in time, and >
joi fail to secure to herselfthe commerce of . f
i country capable of producing and consum- ' J
ing more than Louisiana and Mississippi
united. 1 his question will not admit of
delay. The situation of Texas requires
that he should strengthen herself by alliances
some where. If a short sighted
policy should induce this Government to
reject the overtures she has made, the alternative
must be the closest alliance with . .
Great Britain ; and all who are acquainted . Tiviih
the policy of Gr6at,Britain know that
die never permits an opportunity to pass
af extending her commerce whenever and
wherever she. can, She will purchase of Texas
all the cotton she wants, and fur- nish
her with all the goods she con. r *
surncs. A British consul was at the seat
jf Govcrmcnt during tho session of Con
*ress. Ills object cannot be mistaken, * *
md I presume that communications made
)y him to the Government, produced the
ippointmentofa minister to the court of
:?t. James.
That the cause of Texas wiH ultimately : > .1*'
riuraph there cannot be a doubt; and 1 '& '
i;n quite sure that no one acquainted with ' "
he fact can for a moment believe that
VIexico can resume her jurisdiction over
hat country. Whatever may have been
aid to the contrary justice and right are
>n (he side of Texas. Mexico permitted
colonziuation, only that she might have a >
jarrier between her citizens & the Indians.
She committed arbitrary acjs of oppress- on
towards them whenever an opportun*
ty presented, and violated her solemn compact
with them. The time arrived for reiistance,
or expulsion from a country they
iad redeemed from savages and the wilderness.
The war on the part of Mexico '
^asthe most ferocious ever waged against .
my people, even in the most barbarous
iges. They laid waste the country whereiver
they went.?Nothing escaped them.
Hie houses of the people were given to the
flames, the "plantations utterly destroyed,
die crops cut down, and the stock killed or
driven off. The invaders violated every
principle of civilized warfare by an indiscriminate
massacre of all who fell into their
power. They violated the terms of cap- .
itulation and, in cold blood, murdered nearly
three hundred at one time. The forbearance
of Texas in her hour, of triumph
does her the greatest honor. The prbonirs
were spared, and even the author and
the actor in all these scenes of atrocity was J
permitted to go free. The cause of Tex* - i
as is that of civil liberty, constitutional law,
and freedom conscience; that of Mexico is, '
priestcraft bigotry, and despotism. Is
there any of our race who can hesitate hi
his wishes as to the result ?*
I had heard much of the factions and
misrule ofTexas ; I had heard its people
represented as marauders and robbers.
Nothing can be farther from the truth. I \.
will venture to say th^t there has been no
country in the midst of revolution where
less crime has been committed, or where
the laws have been so promptly administered.
In their public policy the
whole people are united, in resistance to
Mexico. They must and will triumph.
I have, in great haste and in a desultory
manner, given you facts derived from ob? .
servation. The only object 1 have is the
correction of some errors which the Public
in terra in in relation to affairs in Texas.
I have already extended this communica]
ion to a much greater length tnan I inten.
led. I fiave addressed it to you, because
you have been the warm advocate of the
cause of Texas from the commencement of
ler struggle for liberty, and because your
exertions in her behalf are gratefuly appre.
ciated by her People. You may publish as
much or as little of it as you may choo^L
