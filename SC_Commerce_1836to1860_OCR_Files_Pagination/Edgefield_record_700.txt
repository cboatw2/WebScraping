Of Mr. Pickens. of South Carolina, on, the
Tarif and the Res'rictive Policy: deliv

June 22. 1842.
The Ilot.se hein;: in Committee of the
# hole gin the state of the Union. and the
tai ff bill being before thet fcr contsidera
tion
Mr. PICKENS. of South Carolina, ad.
dressed the committee as fhllows:
Mr. CuAIRFAm: The bill upon your ta
ble has two objects-the fitst to raise re
venue for the wants of thi- government ;
and, secondly. to afford. by restriction,
protection to large interestS coiter ted n ith
domestic manufactures. i % iil he my ob
ject, at present, to confino e li princi
pally to the first branch of the subject. and
reservo what I may have to say Ot other
topics to some other stago of this discus
nlon.
The chairman of the Committee of
Waya and Means (Mr. Fillmore) has es
timated that $27.500,000 of net revenue
w a nece.sary for tle annual expentlitures
of this government; and, boy his bill, he
proposes to raise that revenue exclusively
out of thejoreign im portations of the coun
try. The'gross atmount proposed to be
raised is $32.0000.00: but S5,(j0.000 are
allowsed for expenses and drawbacks. If
I understand him correctly, he rested his
estimates nod calculations upon a supposed
avernee of imports to the amonnt of $107,
000.000- Front this he deducted $18..
000 000 of goods re-shipped or re-exported.
upon which duty would he refunded in the
shape of drawbacks, or would not he col
lected under a warehostaing system. Thi-i,
then, would leave $89.000.000 of imports
from which revenuo would be collected.
Then. again. fron. this would be deducted
near $12.000,000 of free articles-about
86.000.000 in speci:-, and $6.000.000 in
free goods: in all. $12.0tt0,0110 We then
have a balance of $77.00,00-or, I he.
lieve. acconing 'i the calculation of the
chairman. $71,000.000-out of which you
are to collect taxes to the amount of $:-7,
500,000. This, then, would amount to a
general average of about thir:y six (36)
per cent. Thirty -six per cent. upon $7,
000,000 would be $27.720.000. Now, the
great practical ques'ion for thiscommittee
and the country is, can that amount be
raised from foreign commerce, in the pro
-sent sto of the commercial world?
whom awl
#his government in a low and difficlh sit n
ation. but the Statep are (many of them)
in a far worse condition. The corporations
and companies of associated wealth in the
Statesa, together with individual citizens,
are- all under the deepest embarrassment
and prostration. Taxation, at this junc
ture. is a question of the deepeat interest to
all portions of thiscummttunity. Ani why
it it that f(nre-gn commerce should be se
lected as the sole source of an enormous
revenue to suttport a wasteful government?
I- commerce more prosperous tban ither
branches of national industry ? Why
ihould we burden it e-xclusively? There
never wias a period teti it needed more
your tosteringeare. The chairman (Mr.
Fllmore) enot drive mc into a discts
sotn upon direct taxation or excises. I at
not to he drawn off upon any collater:l
issues he may choose to raise, by way of
diverting public attention front the unjtst
tudtmprcticable provisions of the bill
upon your table. I hold him to a discus
sion upon the specific measure ie has pro
posed. lie nsist proive the aiffimative. I
shall advance the negative. lie being in
power, atnd at the head eof the finatceecotm
mittee,. it is with htm and his party to sus
tain the credit of the- Covermntt nod shtow
he soundnerss of his mteasure for that pur
pose We have no rower lf. but to ex
amine the spectfic maeastures proposed. We
have before us. -'t present, a tax of 36 per
cenat. tnpona $77,000,000 worth of imports.
advocated as the great atnd only measure
by which % ou are to raise $27.00J0,000 of
revenue. I shall nut at ptresenlt discuss
the acuestion as to wheo is to pay this tax
I shallinut say that at falls entirely uipotn
tho producer of those exptorts which are
exchanged for the atnp--rtations that you
designt to tax by this bill. But theo doctrine
thtat it falls exclusively upon the consu
mer, is as far from trutha (to say te least
of it) as to say thtat falls upon the produ
cer. As well mtght you a that a direct
tax upon houses will full exclusively upona
consumners. The argumnent in that case,
Iau ppose. n ould be. tha' the ow ner of th,
house wo-..Id reimaburse htutself for the di
rect tax in the increasedl price of rent. So,
ini like manner. thte batte argumnent woauld
be advancwed as to the opleraltioni of excise
dutte-s. The producer of the domestic
god. upetm which an excise might be Ie
ied, woul iidemniafy hitmself in the en
hancedl price ofl his articlo when sold.
But, sar, is this true! it mtighat he if you
coul get the enhlanced rent, or the in
creased ptrtce upon the goods sold. It is
clear that, if it could be got with the tax
imposed, it could also be got without the
tax. Thte trutha is, that the tax, whatever
it may he, and whatever form it ma- as
sume, falls linally, for the most part, upon
productive labor, in all its branches. An
impost taix falls, itt the first instance, prin
cipally upon the producer of experts. by
lessening demand abroad; and, in the se
cond instance, upon all branches of do
mestic labor and capital, connected with
comimerce; and, in athe third instance, upon
the consuamer. It Onally falls upon the
producc. ibe mcrchan:. and the cnsumer;
but with greater disaster upon the first.
The producer may not be able to e:hange
bis capital or labor. and then it is full of
pressure and ruin to him.
But, sir, to come bark to the revenue ol
$27,000,000 proposed to be raised by this
bill frotm the importsofthe country. I lay
down the proposition, that, in the existing
state of the country. you cannot rmise that
amount from our foreign commerce.
Gentlemen seem to think that the coun
try is where it nas in 1828 and 1832:
whereas there is almost a total change of
our circumstaices. In 1828 sd 1832,
we had the United States Bank in full
I operation, with all its credits. We then
bad about $104,000,000 of Circulation
throughout the Union. In January, 1837,
we had $14d,000,t000 circulation. And
now, in 1842. we have only $4,000,000.
In 1828, we had 6,000,0YJ of population
le-s than we now ha',e. We now have
17.000,000. wit h a circulation of $94,000,
000, and, in 1828. we had 11,000,000 of
people, with $10,000,000 more of circula
tion than we now have. Aga.n: in 1828,
we had only about $49.000000 of specis;
and now some estimate it at $70,01.0,00,
and others at S90.000,000-sny we have
$80,000,000. Then, in 1828, we had
more tha: 50 pet cent. more circu!ation
than specie; ani, in 1842, we have only
$10,000,000 more. % e have now a cur
rency near the speci,. standard. A nd yet
gentlemen propose a tax of 36 per cent.
upon commerce, when we have in the
country less circulation by 810.020AG
than we had in 1828. andl with G0A00,OO
more of population. They propose this
enormous insation, too, when our circula
tion and specie are near the same amount.
Do gentlemen suppose that the country or
commerce can stand it under thess cir
cumstance? Sir, it would produce pes
sure and disaster beyond calculaton. A
tax of 36 per cent. now upon importatioos,
would be equal to a tax of 60 per cent. in
1828. This tax, in the present emtarra3
sed state of the country. together with its
contracted circtslatiou, would produes
greater restriction upon your importatine
than even 60 per cent. would in 1828; sa4,
instead of raising the revenue expectad,
would be a failure in proportion to the
amount ofimports cut off by restriction.
But, sir, great as is our diffierence now
and in 1828, as to bank credits. circulation
specie, and population, it is not greater
than is our diderence as to surplus capital
and labor in the Ioun. n PIa Jber
Prudisedo o country. 'We hall, flil
tide ofenterprising population sweeping to
the Northwest and Southwest, engaged
in new and vabt settlements and cultiva
tion ; and the same might be said also as
to that rich and noble country in Western
New York. What, now, ts the state of
the country ? Al that large class of
capitalists connected with stocks and banks
are hopelessly prostrated. A large amount
of capital is now lying idle in all our ci
iies, and in many sections of the country,
waiting to see more as to future prospects.
So it is as to labor engaged in all domes
tie productions. There is a great stagna
tion, particularly in the region that pro
duces the great export staples. There is,
at this moment, more surplus labor than
we have ever had. The consequence
wituld be, that if you impose high restric
tive duties under these circumstances, the
immene amount of surplus labor and cap
ital, or rather that amount that is not pro
fitably employed, would Instantly take the
direction of investmentd In the production
of ihose very manufactures, upon the iam
portatiob of which you propose to raise a
revenue. Then. sir, in the eudet propor
tion thet your restrictive taxation tempts
or forces iuvcestments itt the production of
thme domestic article, does it itn lIke man
ner, cut off the foreign import, and conse
quetly the revenue, It is thus clear
that, as a fin ance tmeasure, it must fail,
But this is not all. If an undue propor
tiona of thme surptlus cap~ital and labor of the
country should be tempted into domestic
manufactures by your legislation, the re
sukt would be, that they would come then
into direct competition with establishments
ntow fixed andl in operation. And unless
you again extendedf the circle of protec
tion to meet new contingencies, the bene
fits of the present, as a protective measure
would in the end fail and prove disastrous.
In the present state of the currency, capi
tal. and labor of the country, you cannot
tell what deep injury you may finally in
flict by high restrictive measures (such as
the present bill) upon your foreign com
merce. If you expect to collect 827,000,
000 of revenue f-om imports, you will be
entirely deceived.
Again, sir, let us look for a moment at
a very powerful, increasing, and import
ant section of this confederacy, as compa
red with its situation in 1826-I mean the
interior JWest. In 1828, it was almost en
tirely a new country. Its labor and capi
t al was then actively employed in cutting
dotwn their magnificent forests, in clear
ing lands, and in erecting habitations for a
hardy and enterprising population. Ar that
period they were but limtted consumers of
foreign importations. They confined them
selves to the mere necessaries of life, and
kept their expenditures to the minimum
point. The taxation upon imports was at
that period of little importance to them.
Not so now. No country on the face of
the earth has improved so rapidly. From
being small consumers, they are destined,
in the next ten years to be thbe greatest con
sumters of any other section of this Union

En;l.tnid,
31r. Chairman, it i.4 3mid. that we must
have a tarit. and restrictive mensares, in
order to preserve our specie in the coun
try, and prevent its exportation. Let us
examine for a moment this proposition.
Suppose it to be true: how is it to operate?
As a mere tneasure of value, specie has
two great offices to perform: first, it adjusts
balances in trade between us san foreignt
countries; and, secondly, it is the measuro
of value fur our donestie productions at
home. When the balance of foreign trado4
is against us, foreign exchanges rise, and
there is a demand for specie to meet them.
This can be prevented, as is said, by re
strictive measures-which, of course, must
operate to cut off importations that other
wise would be made, so as to adjust the
balance of trade, and make foreign ex
changes in our favor. For Istance: su
pse-oueapset *10ioOE0OOOi~aains, -:,
and, under free trade-, would import in ex.
change for it more thiea that amoun.
Then, say the advocates of the tariff to
preserve sp.-cie, you must have high re
strictions, or foreign exchanges would, id
that case, be against us, and the exporta
tinu o.fspecie would follow it. And to pre
vent this, the argument is. that Sy resine
lon you would reduce tli importations
below S100,000,Oo itt value; and thus the
balance, connectel also with the profits of
trade. would be brought back in specie.
This must be the modus operandi, if it bei
true that restrictton is to premt ve our spe
cie from exportation. But do not gentle
met see that by this courm they adrmit
that a high tarillfdues cut off iiporttitns.
nd thereby, a-, a nrcessary c-mequrnce,
lesseus the demantd for cxport-; and is, to
that extent, a tax uponexport,? But sup
pose, sir, you do, by restriction. forco the
imnprtatiou 11f specie instead of :oods. For
instauce, in the ctse omf the $t00.00.0OU
of exports, iostead of bringing back $110,

back that amiount its -p,,ecme; w hat. then. is
the resulm l The value of specie hero ist
that it turntishes an accurte mecasure of
our anntmual dlomestic pr..ducetin. and pro

of new credita, new cxpansiotn, now circu

And, then, what is time seconud result ?
Prices rise ont every thing, ammd the cost of
productiott is increased until it reaches tho
point at which you have, by restriction,
fied your proEtection : amnd then thet for
igmn article'comes in under the swell of
your local expansion. And then you must
raise te restrictive harrier higher-until a
new expansion, in like manner,again takes
place ; when you must run thme maine rouad,
