the opitio mtb&~dinocraticteparty on
t ofia ak of the U. States:
An as iuton'pethps scarcely second
ever to'thetariff in the injury it has cansed
p'l'-of'thiscountry. -In the' most
mianner,'the unconstitutionality of
't iOstutioti was declared., and the
fa ,ard strength'of the party pledged to
the most decided opposition whenever it
shouldhetagain proposed.
Next tothese came the opinion of that
Convention 'on the question of the aboli
lion movement; and here too the most
positive and decided opinion was, as to
the unconstitutionality of all measures
tending to an interference with our do
mestic institutions. These institutions are
there considered such as in fact they are,
the property of the South alone; To at
tempt an interference with them, is the
same as to agitate the question of a ter
mination of our Union- .The only arbi
ter to whichwe can appeal, upon a ques
tion of such vital importance, isthe sword !
These principles, so well and clearly ex
pressed, were written on the banner un
der which we rallied in the contest of.
1840. They are still our principles, and
the principle, of the Democratic party of
the Union. "They will, we trust, ever
continue to'be the principles in support of
which the Democracy will be rallied.
Mr. Magrath -said it was true, that in
the last Presidential 'election, we had not
been successful. It was not now neces
sary to allude to the circumstances which
had combined to defeat at once the. party
and the principles we professed. The
election of 1840 had resulted:in the defeat
of Mr. Van Buren, and the -elevation of
General Harrison. But Providence had
willed that the triumph should not be -en
joyed. A very brief time removed Gen.
Harrison from the Presidency, and John
Tyler became the President.
The death of Gen. Harrison was equiv
alent to the defeat of the whig party.
Although the nominee of a whig conven
tion, Mr. Tyler could not carry through
the measures which Mr. Clay and his
whig friends so much desired. For this
manly and independent refusal, he has
been subjected to the most unmeasured
obliqty and abuse. Ingenuity has been
taxed to lavish censure and approprium
on him-and for what I Because John
Tyler, of Virginia, could not forget the
principles so ably set forth - in the resolu
tions of his own State-because he still
adhered to the faith set forth in these reso
lutions, with the resolutions of the :State
of Kentucky-because he remembered the
high and solenn obligations of the oath he
had taken, and had manfully determined
to act as became the President of a nation
-not of a party.
Great as was the issue -made up in the
Presidential contest of 1840, that involved
in the present contest was not inferior.
The same principles that we then conten
ded for, are still before us. Now, as then,
we were battling for the establishment of
those principles which were identified with
the preservation of our freedom, the per
maneney of the' Union. Now, as then,
these principles were the rallying words of
the whole democratic party. In such a
contest,-it well became the State of South
Carolina-that State where such illustri
ous examples were shown of the high es
timation in whicbiprinciples were held
to-occupy the proper position in the hat
tIe. Whatever else her. revilers might
'say, it'could never be said with truth, that
shehbad ever estered so eagerly in the
gatie ofPresideni-making to forget those
high principles, the support of which are
more important than the elevation or any
man. Her own, most distingtished son,
who had just quitted the ease 'of his re
tirement for thte vexatious and responsi
bilities of a difficult negotiation, was hint
self an illustrious exampl~e of the' course
which ouirState has pursued. And on
this occasio'n she would not falter or hesi
tate. With strong~ hands and generous
heartsawe will again-take our share in the
battle. With the princiles0 we profess,
*defeat has nG danger to fright us frmour
-duty-nor the most brilliant success, power
to dazzle or seduce us. :Every considera
tion conibines and admonishes us not to be
lukewarm at this tiee-and in the van
where we.havoever been-there now will
we be found. -
Mr. .Magrath said, he had feared at one
tiune, that possibly South Carolina, might
-not be inclined to take part in the pending
* contest. But this meeting had dissipated
that fear.- --This mighty, gathering of the
demoeracy well assured all who could
witness 'it, that our front- 'was unbroken
-ongolwIution strong -and undaunted.
:H'ehad'said that the principles wh-lich
hadbeeiU involved in the presidential elec
tion of :1840, were the principles for
which wei-are now contendIng. Another
qluestton,most important to us, wras aliso

the annexation of Texas. Of all the
qnestionaahat were now agitated this was

Mr."Magrath -concluded by saying that

Correspondence of Clwarliston Patriot.
WAsHINGTOS. April 11.
In the Senate, a communication was
received from the Secretary of the Navy,
notifying Senators that on Saturday next,
Mr. Colt will make his experiments
with his sub-marine hattery, in the Poto
mac, near the Arsenal. As stated in a
former letter, Mr. C. will attempt to blow
up a vessel under full sail as she approach
es the navy yard.. Lieutenant Boyle, of
the Navy, will steer the vessel until the
signal fur explosion-when, of course, it is
presumed, he will quit his post. The
President and Heads of Departments will
be in attendance.
As usual, numerots memorials in favor
of the present tarifi' were presented and
referred. Memorials were also presented
complaining of the exhorbitant duty on
sugar.
In the House, a motion was made by
Mr. Ingersoll,.to print 10,000 extra copies
of the report made by him last evening
from the Committee on Foreign Affairs,
in favor of appropriating~$70,000 for com
pensating the owners of the:Amistad.
A motion was made to amend by adding
10,000 copies of a report by the Commit
tee on Manufactures on the subject of the
tariff.
After some discussion of a conversational
character, the whole matter was by a vote
of 85 to 83 laid on the table.
The House then went into Committee
of the Whole, and resumed consideration
of the old harbor bill, with an understand
ing that the debate should cease at two
o'clock.
The amendment of the Senate to the
Pension appropriation bill were then con
sidered in Committee of the Whole.
The principal amendment of the Senate
is as follons: "No persomin the Army or
Navy shall be allowed to draw both a
pension as an invalid, and pay of his rank
or station in the service, unless the alleged
disability for which the pension was gran
be such as to have occasioned his employ
ment in a lower grade, or in some civil
branch of the service." This was agreed
to.
And the atmendment on reducing the
amount for certaitn pensions for widows,
&c. was disagreed to.
This beitng .the case, Mr. Holmnes, whte
is invariably the champion of the weaker
sex, expressed his astonishment at the in
consistency of certain gentlemen, who
while they declined taking up the bill to
modify the tarif, were bent upon cutting
down the appropriations for -poor widows
atnd orphans.
The remark stung several members to
t he quick, if the violent att ack they imtme
diately made upon Mr. IH. may be taken as
an indication. -
A mong others, Mr. Cave Johnson char
ged that dr. Hohtnes did not vote on t wo
occasions when motions were made to
take up the tariff' bill.
Mr. H. easily explained, by stating that
on the first occasion, he was absent at the
State Department, and on the second, al
though in the Capitol, he' diu not know
the question had been put and did not get
within the bar until it was too late to vote.
(The rule is. that no member shall vote,
who wvas not within the bar when his
name was called.) The Clerk had, how
ever, by mistake, recorded his name in the
affirmnatile, although he (lid not vote at all.
This being the case, he, Mr. H., on coat
ing within the bar, appealed to Mr. John
stotn, as to whc:her he ought not asma point
of honor, to state the fact and have 1 is
name.forthwith withdrawn. Mr. J. res
ponded in the affirmative, and Mr. H.
acted in accordance with it. Thnere was
much confusion and great laughter, do
tinyg which Mr. Holmes proposed that if
gentlemen had any doubt as to whtch way
he would vote, they should, at that tinme,
put the question on taking up the bill.
This proposition was however, deelined.
It ts rumored that the President will
send to the Senate a Treaty for the An
nexation of Texas, on Monday next.
Mr. Dixon H. Lewis, is spoken of as
the probable successor of Mr. King, re
cently appointed Minister to France.
April 12.
In the Senate this mortinag, there were
numerous Memorials from New York and
other States, protesting against, any
change in the tariff. *Some of these me
morials have lists of signatures attached
to them a dozen yards long.
The consideration of the tariff resolution
was then resumed.
Mr. Choate having, the floor, made a
long speech in favor of the protective pol
icy. When he concluded the Senate
spent a short time in Executive Session,
and then adjourned, to Monday. There
appears to be no doubt as to the conforma
tion of Mr. Ferris, as Colle.ctor of New
York, in- the pla:e of Mr.. Curtim.
IJothe-House, after the disposal of some
unimportant busines, Mr. Pratt reported
abill aypropriating )75,000 for an addi
tion to the Patent Office, Also, 'a bill au
thorizing the putblication of all'drawings of
all patents hitherto granted. This will be
needlesslabo randexpense mongth an
fortjate class wbwo come on here with
their intentions.and have the' mrtifieation
to-discover that they have been anticipa
ted.
Mr. Phoenix, from- the Committee- on
Commerce, reported a bill establishing' a
Warehousing system. The bill, I under
stand, has no - chance of passage at the
present session. at -
The first section provides ti-at it shall
be lawful for the importer of any goods
dow liable to duties, at his option, to ware
house such goods at the Custom House,
except gunpowder, fresh fruits, perishable
articles, and all goods manufactured of
cotton or exclusively, or both those mate
rials combined.
The remainder of the day was devoted
to private business. Pending a discussion
on a private bill, a member took occasion
to laud the Secretary of the Treasury.,
whose judgment was entitled to the highest
respect.
Mr. Holmes dissented from this. He
gave his experience as to the eogree of
respect '-hich was due to the decisions and
opinions of Mr. Spencer. He referred to
one case when he Mr. Holmes, on urging
a private claim from a constituent, was
convinced by Mr. Spencer that it ought
not to be granted. To his surprise, how
ever, a short time afterwards, he received
a letter from the claimant, thanking him
Mr. H1. for getting the motley- Thus it
appeared Mr. Spencer had suddenly chan
ged his mind. Mr. H. also spoke of the
degree of respect due to the opinions of a
man who from denouncing the vetoes, sud
denly turned round and' approved' them
all.
It is understood that the treaty of an
nexation between this country and Texas
was signed to day. The Madisouian says
it will be submit ted to the Senate as soon
as the document can be prepared.
April 13.
The Senate as usual, was not in session
to-day, having adjourned from last even
ing to Monday next, on which day it is
said the Texas annexation treaty will be
submitted. The advocates of annexation
confidently predict, that the documents ac
companying the treaty wtll contain rea
sons so powerful that all oppositien must
fall to the ground.
In the House after the adoption of some
unimportant resolutions of inquiry, the
Army Appropropriation bill was taken up
in Committee of the Whole.
Mr. McKay moved to amend it by stri
king out $300.000 from the appropriation,
so as to make the bill comport - with the
Retrenchment bill..
The amendment was slebated by Mes
srs. Hale, White, Ingersoll and others, un
til two oclock;.whdu vitloit taking .the
question, the . O9mmittee rose and the
House adjourned, in order to.fiford mem
bers an opportunity to witness the subma
rine experiment of Mr. Colt.
In order to show the power of his bat
tery, Mr. Colt caused the water of the
river at various places to boil up to the
height of about three hundred feet. It
was a beautiful sight.
The ship chosen for the experiment was
a vessel of 500 ions, in full -sail, with the
stars and stripes waving at the most head.
At the appointed time, 25 guns were
fired at the Navy Yard. ot which Lieut.
Boyle lasbed the helm and left the vessel
to drive before the wind. When at a
suffcient distance he fired a rocket from
his boat, whereon the noble ship, as if by
tagic, rose gracefully on the swvelling
wave, gave a slight shudder, and then
-tiit the acclamations of the spectators
fell into a thousand fragments. The ex
periment was completely successful, and
p)roves tha1t any vessel, whatever may be
its speed, can he thus destroyed on ap
proaching ottr coast. Other experiments
on a grander scale will be tried.
April 15.
In the Senate, to-day, there were as
usual scores of memorials against any
modification of the Tariff or the annexa
tion of Tfexa.
A letter of resignation from Mr. King
was received an-d laid on the table.
The resolution of the F~inance Commit
tee relative to the Tariff bill of Mr. Mc
Dulfie was then taken up.
Mr. Choate having the fioor, resumed
and concluded his remarks iu favor of the
protective policy.
The Senate then went into Executive
Session, confirmed the nomination of Mr.
Martin, as Secretary .of the French Lega
tion, and then adjoumned. Mr. Martin was
formerly editor of the Washirgton Spec
tator.
In the House, aller the disposal of some
untimportant busitness, Mr. Cave Johnston
called tip his resolution, providing for a
termination of the debate on the Army
Appropritiont hill in Committee of the
Whole, two hours after it should be taken
up. It was adopted.
Mr. McKay in pursuance of notice mo
ved to go into the Committee of the Whole
on the TarifF bill.
It being utnderstood that the vote wvas to
decide the fate of the hill, there were loud
calls for a call of the House. A call was
accordingly ordered, and proceeded in un
til 170 members answered- to their natmes.
The doors wete then closed and the names
of the absentees called. Various excuses
wvere made for them, some of a very laugh
able character.
Mr. Thompson moved that all further
proceed iing in the call be susprended.
This motion gave rise-to a spirited de
bate. Those in favor of the suspension
argued that if a sense of dutty would not
secure the attendacce of, a member, other
means would be useless. He would be
anwerable to his conshitpenits.
Mr. Holmes argued in favor of a com
pulIsory attendance, when members after
due notice that a great measure would be
called up. failed to appears.
Finally, the motion to suspend prevailed.
The question on going into Committee
on the bill was then put and decided in the
negative. The Vote was yeas 84, nays
95. So the bill is considered as lost, at
least for the present session. Its friends
have given it up.
The House then went into Committee
and took up the Army Appropriation bill.
After some remarks of a spirited char
acter from Messrs. Morse and. Hamlin,
an amendment. was concurred in which
reduces the amount of the item for the pay
of'the Army, so as to maken the bill cnm
port with the Retrenchment bill. Numer
ous proposed amendments olfered by other
members were rejected,. after which, the
bill was reported'n the House.' The
above .amendment of Mr.. McKay was
agreed to, after which the bill.was Passed..
April .16.
In the Senate, the.frst hour was accu
piel by the presentation of Memorials pro
testing against any modification of the
Tariff or the annexation of Texas.
Memorials were also presented against
the passage of any international copyright
law.
The tariff resolution came up next in
order. but Mr. Bagby who had the floor
consented to its postponement till to-mor
row.
The Post Office Reform Bill was then
tasken up,
The pending, question was on a motion
by Mr. Woodbury to amend by providing
tltttt double postage should be charged for
double rates only. He explained that the
bill provided that the postage should be
five cents for half an ounce, and double
that for the addition of a quarter of an
ounce. It the letter was but three quar
ters of an ounce in weight be wished to
charge it accordingly.
After debate, this amendment was agreed
to.
The remainder of the day was occupied
in the discussion of other proposed amend
ments. As there appears to be no chance
of any final action on tho bill at the pres
ent session, the discussion creates but little
interest.
Several messages in writing were in
the course of the day received from the
President. I understand, that the annex
ation treaty was not among them.
In the House, a motion was made by
Mr. Duncan to suspend the rules for the
purpose of considering his bill, which pro
vides for the casting of votes for President
and Vice President on the same day. The
motion was rejected by a large vote. It
is evident that no definite action will be
taken on the bill at the present session.
Mr. Cranston, on leave, presented a
Memorial from the majority of the Legis
lature of Rhode Island. protesting against
the right of the Honse to institute an in
vestigation into the constitutionality of the
present charter of the State. The Memo
rial was laid on the table and ordered to
be printed.
A few minutes afterwards, however,
Mr. Burke, the Chairman of the Rhode
Island Committee, 'iscovered, that since
the order to print had been made, another
paper had been appended to the Memorial.
This additional paper enbrnced the reso
lotions of censure on the minority of the
Legislature whose Memorial was referred
to a select committee some weeks ago.
With a view, therefore, of preventing the
printing of this paper, Mr. Burke moved
a reconsideration of the vote on the order
to print.
On this motion a tedious debate of three
hours in length took place, in which some
hard words were used. The member
from Rhode Island, however, emphatical
ly declared that in appending the addition
al paper he had no idea of imposing on
the douse. Finally, the motion to re
consider prevailed, when the objectiona
hle paper was withdrawn.
Mr. Burke then presented a Memorial
from the minority of the Legislature pro
testing against the course of the majority.
This was laid on the table and ordered to
be printed.
The vote on the passage of the Army
Appropriatiop Bill was then reconsidered
for the purpose of entertaining an amend
ment appropriating 815.000 for the Bar-'
racks at Newport. Kenttucky. A fter ude
bate an amendment was agreed to, and
the bill once more passed.
A pril 17.
In the Senate, the House hill appropri
atirng $166.000O (or the continuation of
works at the various Navy Yards, wvas ta
ken up and finally passed.
After the presentation of Memorials a
gainst the annexation of Texas, the con
sideration of the Post O0liee Reform B3il
was resutmed. [Nomerous amendments
were of'eredl and debated till a late hour.
when without any final act ion on the bill, a
motioni to adjourn prevailed
I am told that the Spanish docume s
to accompany t he Texas annexation treaty,
are nearly ready. The treaty will proba
bly be submitted to-morrowv. It appears
that the documents shew that propositions
for the cession of Texas were made by
England previous to the revolution in the
Territory.
In the House. Mr. C. J. Ingersoll reporr
ed from the Committee Ott Foreign Af
fairs, a bill appropriating $12,000 for the
ascertaitiment of claimns of our citizenms for
French Spoliations prior to 1801. This
sum is intendedl for the compensation of
Commissioners to inyestigate saidl claim.
Mr. Patten made an tneffectual mtotion
to suspend the rules, for the purpose of in
troducing a resolution providing for the
stoppage of the pang of such metmbers who
may be absent on' the call of the roll.
Mr. Douglass made a speech in which
he contended that Government has the
p)ower to appropriate money for intornal
improvements.
Mr. Rhett cotild not agree to the doc
trine. He contended that it would go far
to prove that Government ought to assume
the State debts, because it was well knowvn
that those debts wvere contracted for inter
nal improvements.
Mr. Holmes next took the floor, and in
his usual eloquent manner, repeated his
former views on this suhject. He main
tained that the General Government has
no right to appropriate money for the im
provement of rivers unless it possesses an
exclusive proprietory right in the same,
and where there is no right in any State.
For instance, the General Government had
an exclusive proprietory right on the Ohio
and 51isuissippi Rivers, and was therefore
bound to improve their navigation, for the
benefit of the whole country. But in all
other cases where no such exclusive right
existed,'the Governnent had, he contend
ed, no power to interfere. He alluded to.
the fact that irT the bill there were appro
priations for Charleston. These, in such
a bill as this, he considered tinconstitution
al, althtough he maintained the money
ought to be appropriated in a Military Bill.
His remarks were listened to with great
attention.
The debate wa cntinead to a late ho,,'

ers. ill a late' hour. " =
The amendment of the "oimmittee of
the Whole, increasing the' idaoor he
improvement of the Ohio Riverso @100,

Pending the considernhion of other a
mendments, a motion to adjourn prevailed.
_ISCELLAVEOUS.
Froa the New Orleans Buetin
Texas, Mexico and the United States.
On the 23rd of August last, Mr. Bocanegra
the Mexican Secretary ofSiate, notified
our minister at Mexico, Gen Waddy
Thompson, that the annexation of Texas
to the United States, would he regarded
by his government as a just canse for a
declaratiun of war. .Thiinotfseatio~n was
met the next day by General Thompson
in a short and spirited reply, which doet
as much honor to his talents as a diploma.
tist, as to his character of a-high minder
gentleman.
The Mexican government sunsequently
discerned that their threat was unavailing
and that the Executive of the United States
was determined on annexation with of
without the consent of Mexico. This de
termination placed Mexico in a false posi
tion. If annexation took place withou
her consent, she was bound to make goo<
her threat, and declare war against the
United States, or to back out of the comba
and acknowledge that her threat was a
vain and idle boast never intended to be
carried into effect.
Under such circumstances what line o
conduct could a country so situated be ex
pected to pursue? War was out of the
question; it would have proved too disas
trous, too fatal to Mexico. The pride o
her Dictator would not allow him in. th<
face of so recent a declaration. so emphat
iclaly anounced to draw back, and. Buffet
the scorn that would he heaped on him
not only by his own country but by the
world. No alternative was left him but t<
negotiate with one or both of the par' ies in
terested, and endeavor to obtain the tes
terms he could for the acknowledgemen
of the independence of Texas, or for a ces
sion of the claim of Mexico on that coun
try.
Accordingly, we find that through the
British Minister resident in Mexico at
overture was made to the government o
Texas for a cessation of hostilities with a
view of treating for peace. This negotia
tion has as yet produced nothing nor<
than an armistice, which if unt followed up
by a treaty of peace, is to terminate on th<
first of May. Scarcely have the commis.
sioners who negotiated thes armnistice timn
to return to their respective government
before the armistice will be at an end, and
hostilities recommenced. Can an armis
tice of so short duration be accounted for
on any other ground than that of negotia
tion with the United States being so far
advanced as to render a long period un
necessary.
About the month of December Genera
Thompson had announced his intention of
returning to the United States. A sloop oi
war was despatched to Vera Cruz, to con
vey him to Pennsacola. This vessel was
detained at Vera Cruz about a month,
every mail bringing assurance of his being
on. the point of departure. Suddenly, it
was announced that Gier. Thompson could
not leave Mexico-that he would be de
tained about two months longer, The
sloop ofwar left Vera Cruz without him.
It is not pretended that GeneralT homps n
remained in Mexico on his private affairs.
Couriers bet ween him and his Governument
were passing and repassing. Some nego
tition ofimportance was evidently on font.
What negorinition of sufficient importance
to induce him to send away the sloop of
wvar, could det ain him, other than the ces
sion of the claim on Texas and her annex
ation to the United States? All other dif
ferencel between Mexico atnd the United
States h~d been satisfactorily arranged.
On the 9th of March Gen. Thomnpson
having concluded the affair, whatever it
was, which detained him. left Mexico, and
is tnow on his way home. On that day he
addressedl a letter to Mr. Bocanegra, Mint
ister of foreign relations, in which liesays:
"Ahltiough on my arrival the relations be
tween our two countries were in the nmost
delicate situation, and embarrassing ques
tios since, is is to me a source of congrat
ulation that the bonds of friendship be
tween the two count ries have been strentgth
enied instead of weakened. The archieves
of this legation will bear orders of August
and September last, orders which do not
refer alone to my countrymen, but also to
all countries, that I have not made a sin
gle official demand. or even a simple re
quest, which was not granted. For this I
do tnt claim atiy merit, other than to have
been guided in my official conduct by the
great maxim of my country ini its relations
with other powers, viz. to ask nothing but
what is right, and submit to nothing wrong.
Did General Thomupson then ask for ths
cession of the claim of Mexico on Texas.
or what to the United States would hi
equivalent the acknowledgment of the in.
dependence of Texas ? With the deter
mination of our Executive to annex at at
hazards, to spare to Mexico the necessity
oif carrying out her threat of a declaratiot
of war, this would be "askinig nothing bu
what was right;" it would he on act c
comity if not a duty, to ask it, and to poin
out the consequences of a refusal to com

proved by its having been before asked
and not only by the United States, as res
pects the indepetndence of Texas, by Grea
Britain and by France.
The moment for such a negotiation wa
favorable. The diplomatic relations be
tween Mexico and Great Britain had beet
suspended, and apprehensions of a ruptur
entertained. Mexico would naturally seel
to "strengi hen instead of weaken tha
bounds of friendship between herself ant
the United States." No British Mintiste

of Mr, Ca11hou0.
Corrspendena of the. N.",Y.-.Herald
VAsusroTopw,13th Apri:;
I am glad, to. be able, to,, give you the
fact.; it matters not whence 1. get them,
it is enough that. impliit;.credit may h?,
given to them. The leaditg. terms of thp ""
Texian Treaty are as follows: '
1st. The United States are to dischisge
or assume the debts of Textii, to ths
amount of what the sales of Texian
Lands will pay, and no farther Tbe as- 'y';
3umption will unlyequal the sales of the
lands.
r 2d; Texas is to be admitted:as a Ter
ritory, and to be allowed ode Delegate it ,
Congress. I.am not positively inforeidn
as to the matter of-the Delegate, hit-h'v
no doubt as to the truth of the sja rrrent.
3d. Nothing is said abett'ul vecy; ad
tin this point- I suppose will ben'h onl ' ,:
issue in ratifying' the treaty.
4th. The accompanying correspondence: '
(w bich will be laid before the Setesil1
devolope the fact that England has beeTa ;;
making overtures to Texas of en alliance.
The government of the United States has
heen apprised- of the fact... Mr. Upshinr
entered into correspondence with MrYvZ
Everett upon the subject. Mr. Everett re
plied. Mr. Upshur wrote again. Since
his death an answer has been received.
And the whole correspondence will be sub
mitted to the Senate. -
5th. The treaty must be ratifid-n'
order to take effect-within thirty daystj;
after it shall be sent in to the Senate.
Here is an additional important fact.
rho course which Mr. Calhoun has taken
relative to the Oregon Boundery has ar
rested the negotiation upon . that.questionn'",
till Mr. Puckenbam .shall have obtained
further instructions from his government.
I have but few remarks to make to
night upon the facts. One is to call atten..
tion to the extraordinary despatch (so un
like Webster's negotiation with Ashbur
ton,) and energy, and decision of charac
ter exhibited by Mr. Calhoun. It reminds
ono of "Old Hickory's" administration.
The people like a bold, prompt, and ener
getic leader, who is not afraid to assume
the responsibility.
The fact that the Oregon negotiation
ha' been arrested by Mr. Calhoun's' posi
tion. leads me to think he will not relic
quish an inch of bona fide U.iited-States'
soil, and hence the difficulty. If this le a
fact, the whole mighty west will fling up -
their hats for joy. and hoora [that's. Web
tter's orthography] for Calhoun. .
Douhtless the object of inserting the t'30
days" proviso is to compel the Senate to -
act upon the treaty before adjournment.
The facts respectinig the interference of
England with Texas are of an astounding
chaneter, and cannot fail to exasperate
who people of this country. wvho will not
allow a foreign power to interfere in a
family quarrel het ween the United States
and Texas. I had some time since in
ror med you of these facts.
The treaty must secure the entire south
ern vote-and Mr. Calboun's Oregonp
sition will also ensure it at least the entire
democratic western vote. It will also get
several strong northern votes.
Ini a row short wveeks, Mr. Calhoun's
name weill again be rn uap for the Preai
dency (in 1848,) and nailed to the mat,
all consideratona to the contrar y notioith
atanding. I don t give this as my opinion,
but as fact.
In my previous letter to day, strike out
a note, at the bottom, in which I express
a doubt about Calhoun's interference in
King's appointenent. &c. Calhoun has not
interfered at all, and I want the statement
to read to that 'effect. This is specially
import ant.
I could say much more, but moy letter
is full. - S. B.

The use of IfarL.-In the last Souathera
Agrictaturi at, we Gund a note frlom Prof.
C. U. Shepard giving the result of an an.
alysis of some Marl sent him from Hilton
Head. The ingredients were found to be,
in 100 parts. 82 6 of silica (sand;) 5.056
only ol' carbonate of lime and the rest per
oxide of iron, alumina-and water. The
conclusion of course is that such Marl is no
Marl at all, and that the spreading it on
latnd is more likely to improverish than en
rieh it. Planters shotuld use some care aind
caution in this matter. If possible, the
earths taken for Marl, should always be
subjected to Chemical analysis before they
are used. Scarcely any two deposites will -
be found exactly alike in all ingredients
and the proportion of carbonatt of.limne in
each should he taken into consideration,
in determining the quantity to be pat oa
lands. Where a strictly esientific analysis
