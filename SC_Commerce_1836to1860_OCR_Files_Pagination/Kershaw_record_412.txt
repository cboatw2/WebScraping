GOOD SIGNS.
The Democratic rally throughout the
country has driven the Federal leaders
and their instruments almost t > deperation.
Some of them in this city, and in the halls
of Congress, within a few days have been
heard not only to utter the most violent
denunciations against individuals, but to
threaten a resort to arms, if they do not
succeed iu the coming elections!
This is no more than might be expected
"L " ? . ?(' itn IJilnor licnrna
from IDC Stipjiunci 3 t'l uiv , , (
tion in Pennsylvania. That there are!
men in the country who would, if they I
had the power, usurp the Government
by force of arms, we cannot doubt, because
they say so, because they have defended
such nn effort, and because they
are not restrained by any political or moral
principle. The vast amount of money
they have at command, and the facility
with which they bring together thousands
of the'inost depraved and reckless men1
that society embraces, make them too1
formidable to be despised, notwilhstan- |
ding the great preponderance of physical
power which will, at any moment, rally j
to the support of law and liberty.
To debauch and deprave as large a portion
of the people as possible, seems to
be a leading object with these desperate
men. " Hard cider" has become but a
% name for all the " hard drinks," and the
log cabins erected amidst the palaces of
the rich, as gull trap for the poor, are, in
many places, but dens of drunkenness
and debauchery. The Harrison, leaders
act upon the the principles that the more
vicious they can make society, the greater
are their chances of success; and hence
they are striving to convert our people into
"a nation of drunkards!" This kind
* ' of vice leads to all others; and wherever
it prevails, there is no safely for the properly,
liberty, or lives of peaceful citizens,
who refuse to bow to the ruling demon.
We have before us a letter from a plain
man, who resides in a Western village,
giving* in simple language, a vivid deKrriniinn
of the crowing. depravity. He
1 - w . . f
says: " Whigs are on tiptoe in this place.
It seems as though men, women, and
children would become insane. They are
raising their Harrison flags, and surround
them by companies at night and day.?
v Such noises I think I never heard from
human beiDgs as are made in the night.
Depredations are committed on the property
of the Democrats, or Administration
party: lives havc been threatened. 1
think their procedure will have a tendency
to weaken their own party; for the
most candid of their party begin to express
themselves like this: 'We never;
sarw such an unwise courss taken to gain :
political strength; if this is their course'
to elect Harrison for President, they must
do it without our vote,' &c."
At the Fort Meigs gathering, a Democrat
could not express an opiuion without
being insulted; the ground which had been
consecrated by the blood of patriots, was
drenched with hard cider and whiskey,
and the yell of the drunkard was little
less horrible than that of the savage on
lire same ground, amidst the rage of bottle.
Why is all this drunkenness, noise, and
violence? Is there any thing in it which
ought to incline a rational being'to the
cause which it is practised to advance? Is
there Republicanism, j atriotism, or honesly,
in pouring hard cider, and whiskey,
and brandy, and rnm, down the throats of
the people, instead of pouring intelligence
upon their minds? Is that cause good
which calls toils aid the drunkard's shout
and the bully's bludgeon? Is this the way
that an intelligent people are to govern
themselves? Is this the way to preserve
free governmenl^or the morals of the peo-1

rance, religion, bespect for the
ri6hts of person or property, or ally
of those virtues whirh make a people properous,
honored, and happy?
These practices are above all party considerations.
They strike at the foundations
of society, at the virtue which sus,
tains and preserves life, liberty, and property.
Well may the sober minded Whigs
every where say, as our friends tells us
they do in Ohio, "if this is the coursr)
to elect Harrison for Pp.esident, they
most do it without our vote*" They
Will every where conclude that there are
considerations of higher importance than
the election of this man or that to the
Presidency; and that no evil can happen
to the country under the present Administration,
equal to the drunkenness and demoralization
promoted by the Harrison
leaders as the basis of their hopes and
the chief element of their power.

- . ?'.r, From the Pennst/lvanian.
While the Forlication Bill was under
conderation, in the House of Representatives
on Monday last, Mr. Jones, the
Chairman of the Committee of Ways and
Means, offered an amendment, as on additional
section, empowering the President,
in case oi a deficit in the Treasury,
to postpone, until the close of lite next
Congress, unless Congress shall sooner
act upon the subject, such of the works
provided lor in the bill, as he might deem
the state of the Treasury to require.
This amendment, it appears from the
. dtbite which fullowed, hud referrcnce to
the r>< s ability of the Bank of the United
States not being in a condition to pay its
bond due the (Jovernment, and brought
out the friends of the bank in defence of
that institution. Mr. Wise, Mr. Cooper,
of Pa., Mr. Grinnell, Mr. Evans, and
Waddy Thompson, all spoke in favor of
the bank and against the amendment.
The object of the spcecnes tun tioi appear
very clear. Mr. Wick, of Indiana,
whose remarks we give below, hit upon
the true object, in our opinion, when he
thought that they were intended " to let
it leak out, through his friends here, in a
modest kind of way, so that it may be understood
by the knowing ones, but not
by '.he farmers, or the honest hearted old
Jackson men, who stood by the old chief
in his battle with the monster, that he
(Gen. Harrison) is not hostile to a United
States/'
Mr. Wick said that he had been much
puzzled to comprehsnd the drift and object
of debate in this House; but never
moreso than on the present occasion; The
chairman of the committee of Ways and
Means (said he) has proposed an amendment
to the bill underconsideration, plain,
simple, explanatory, and precautionary,
and in no respect dangerous or obnoxious i
to objection: and lo! it has been made an
occasion to get up a regular set lo upon
the old parly theme?the United States
Bank?and of a last, a final Congressional
charge upon the Administration. At first,
said he, I did not know?as it is now the
witching hour of night?but that my
friends of the Administration party were
dreaming, and had seen the ghost of the
defunct monster stalking through the hall,
accompanied by witches and warlocks,
and long nebbed things. But a moment's
reflection satisfied me that, in stopping at
this conclusion, I was more smart than
wise, (bowing to Mr. Wise of Virginia,)
for 1 remembered that the United States
Bank was not only dead and buried, but
that my Administration friends have, by
the passage of the Independent Treasury
bill, turfed over its grave, and laid its
ghost in the Red sea. Then, sir, said he,
urliv ,?t tliie Into hour of the season, hnre
we been called up to sit here patiently
under the infliction of a regular attack and
defence of that old concern?to- as dull
prosy details about it as we hare ever
heard here or elsewhere?to another and
another attack upon Martin Van Buren and
Levi Woodbury? Why have we witnessed
sundry manifestations of what must here,
I suppose be called chivalry, but which,
in the hoosier State, the boys would call
gostration?
Is not the Administration yet demolished?
Have we not heard it proclaimed in
this House, at our lodgings, and in every
street; by the gentlemen of the opposition
that the Administration is bodaciously
used up, tetotaciously exflunctified?
That in a few weeks Levi Woodbury is to
absquatulate to New Hampshire, Martin
Van Buren to go to Kinderhook, to trundle
cabbages, and that the friends of old
Hickory will find him smoking his pipe
in the deserls of Arabia? Why, then, tomahawk
the slain' Why bring declamation
to bear upon the Administration?
Why pummel and beat over again that
which is already beaten to a jelly, jammed
into a cocked hat, flung into the middle of
next week? Surely the gentlemen of the
Opposition do not wish to labor in vain.
Sir, I have thought of two reasons foi all
this flourish. First, it has occi rred to
me that the Opposition party, being a little
scant 6C doctrine, a personage, called
General Mum, has seen proper, at the
precise close of the session, when the new
f . . I. . A 1 1 . * .
issue cannot De met anu exposeu, 10 jet it
leak out through his friends here in a nio-'
dest kind of way, so that it be understood
by the knowing ones, but not by the farmers,
or the honest hearted old Jackson
men, who stood to the old chief in his
battle with the monster, that he (Gen.
Mum) is not hostile to a United States
Bank.
But as this does not fully account for
the tone of this evening's debate, 1 have
looked around the hall for its exciting
cause. I could surely find no cause in an
attentive audience on the floor, for scarce
a member has paid any attention to a word
which has beti. said. Every one has been
talking at the top of his voice. The din
lias been sucit that one has had to think
by feeling, like one walking in a bnngeon.
But, sir, I have looked further and
higher, and there! and there! and there!
(pointing to the galleries, crowded wjth
ladies,) i find fifty or an hundred good and
beautiful reasons for making a splash on
this floor. Sir, it is time to quit speaking:
voting will be more appropriate.
THE DIFFERENCE.
There arc only these little differences
between the Federal and Republican parlies
of the present day.?The Harrison
men are willing to place a "generous confidence"
in old Tip. and trust him, without
any "declarations of opinion for the public
eye."
The Republican party require a distinct
avowal of opinion on all important questions
before they support any man.
The I-Iarrisoniles are in favor of Bank
Monopolies, with exclusive privileges to
issue as much paper trash as they please,
when they please, and suspend "specie
payments" at their will and pleasure.
The Republicans contend that Banks
have no more right than individuals to
swindle tt?e community, ana reiase 10 pay
their own debts, while they enforce payment
from their debtors.
The Harrison party desire to have a
National Birtk, and full Treasury, the
Banlt to keep the money of the people and
speculate thereon.
The Republican party are opposed to a

more money should be collected from thc.j
people than is sufficient to defray the ex-(
penditures of an economical adwinistrai

*
lion, and that the public money cannot be
constitutionally given to Banks fur purposes
of speculation.
The Federalists are willing to tax the
South for the benefit of the North, to enrich
the manufacturer at the expense of i
our prosperity, and to tax the many by a
Taiiff, to raise an unnecessary and dangerous
surplus, to bovappropriated to In!
ternal Improvements for the advantage
! and convenience of a few.
The Republicans are opposed to these
i and all other schemes of the kind; they
go for Retrenchment and Reform?for
equal burdens and low taxes.
They have no fondness for "hard cider" i
and ball rolling,?no admiration for mock

disposition to associate with Abolitionists
as political allies, but united on principles
openly avowed, they go for the doctrines
of '76, and '98.? Western Carolinian.
Tiikee Thousand Cheers for Hard
Cider!!!
For it is mightier than truth!!!
The Whigs have been celebrating the
anniversary of the battle of Fort Meigs!
Gen. Harrison was there!! and made a
speech!!! "The Alabama State Register,
and Girard and Columbus Advertiser,
&c.," copies the proceedings, speeches,
cheers, and all the other "doings," anil
from that paper we take the liberty of extracting
a paragraph. The General had
been spouting about divers things and
"[Here the General looked around as
"* ^ r n n ?t?k aw tka Aftr tunc MIC.

ed, give the CeDcral some hard cider.'
Tins was done, much to the satisfaction
.of the multitude.]"
Well, we have heard of all sorts of
tom-foolery, but if this do'nt beat " feeding
the henimals," then we'll vote for
Harrison. They ought to have dressed
some Whig Editor; Prentice, for instance,
as a dry nurse and made him feed the
dear thing, with a gallon pot for a pap
spoon. But as the multitude were satisfied,
we had no right to complain.

Up Country Politics.?Bcnj. F. Perry; 1
Esq. of Greenville, well known as a gen
lleman of high character and talents, and
one of the leading members of our Legislature,
has published in the Mountaineer an
addrpss to the people of Greenville, which '
we have read with great satisfaction. Mr.
Perry was the main support of Gen. 1
Thompson in that district?favoring him !
we beliere almost solely on account of ]
their being both opposed to the Sub-Treasury.
He is still opposed to that measure,
but he is also opposed to a National Bank,
to a Tariff, to a system of Internal Improvements?in
short to all the Federal m
and Consolidation principles which he be-1,
lieves would triumph in the election of:
Harrison. He therefore will support Van '
Buren, and his letter is an able and sufficient
vindication of his determination so j
to do. We are glad that Mr. Perry has >
relinquished his intention of leaving the t
Legislature, where his ability, industry I
and high character gave him justly so
uistinguisn^u a position, we Know 100 j
that he will submit with a manful fortitude i
to the victory wc have gained over him in <
the matter of the Sub-Treasury; so we \
shall not indulge even in a passing regret ,
that he has not yet been able to see through |
our spectacles. Mr. Perry's letter will ,
crush the last hope of getting up a Harri- 1
son party to sustain the extraordinary
course of their Representative in Congres.?Charleston

TEXAS AND MEXICO. '
A letter, direct from a citizen and cor- *
respondent of Texas, is now before me.? <
The Mexican troubles are becoming quite
serious, the expected war, between the j
Federalists and Centralists, is now being j
provided for. The Federalists already,
i .j _.1 -.1
nave u uet'iueu uiajuruy, in uiu iiuiuicin i
and eastern stales of Mexico. They had
sent their principal General to New Orleans
for recruits, and were successfully (
engaged in raising volunteers in Texas.?
About four hundred had been obtained
alone from Galveston and Houston. The
Tcxian Government takes no part, yet the
Federalists are quite popular in Texas and
since the two successful engagements last
winter, by a party of the Americans, in
concert with the Federalists against the 1
centralists, the Americans have become a
great terror to the centralists.
The probability of further difficulties i
between Texas and Mexico, no longer ex- ,i
ists. Mexico is expected to perish amidst
her own ruins, while Texas dailv advances
both in power and reputation; i
At this lime it may be justly said, that
Texas claims no small importance among
the civilized nations, with a climate, soil
and location, peculiarly adapted to the enterprising
character of an American people;
at peace with the world, save the ruthless
savage, against whom, a salutary government,
and the ability to support a sufli- 1
cient standing Army, which is now organ- '
ized in Texas, is the only security. She
is destine to prosperity,

If Gen. Harrison's Fort Meigs- speech j
had been originally published in a Democratic
paper we should have suspected the ,
whole afl'air was a hoax.?Camden Jour.
That's exactly what came into our head;
but as we see the speech going the rounds!
of the whig press, we arc of opinion that!'
it is nothing more than an ineffectual attempt
to cram flopdoddlc down the throats
of the people.? Champion of Democracy.

DISGRACEFUL AND BRUTAL OUTRAGE.
On Wednesday evening last Hiram G.
Runnels, ex-president of the Mississippi
Union Bank, basely and brutally attached
Gov. M'Nutt, in the streets, with a club.
TU flf\COI'nnv moo ftnnJInr. An ilia strOpt
4.iiu w?wuvj >v ao siaiiuuig un iuw omvw
in front of the door of Messrs. Hull &
Ware, when Runnels and one or two other
Directors of the Union Bank approached.
The Governor not suspecting an assault,
paid no attention to the party, until Runnels
had thrust his cane into His face. He
then turned upon his assailant and seized
his club, but Runnels got possession of
it and struck him several severe blows,
when the Governor again closed in upon
him, and Runnels desisted from the attack.
The ruffian blows inflicted upon the
Governor will, perhaps, disable him from
attention to his official duties for some
days?one of the small arteries in the head
was cut, and a' considerable quantity of
blood lost.
We know of no language sufficient to
express the baseness of this murderous assault
upon the chief magistrate of the
* !.
oicue.
The cause of the assault is well known
to the people of Mississippi?it is to be
found in the Governor's patriotic opposition
to Bank Robbery, in his manly defence
of the people from the reckless
game which the bankers in Mississippi!
have been pursuing.
And has it come to this ? Does those
whose reckless disregard of law has reduced
the people of Mississippi to their
present miserable estate, expect by bpital
force, by fighting and shedding blood of
citizens, to quell opposition to their course?
It would indeed seem so from the scenes
our city is witnessing. But we cannot
believe that any good citizen will sanction
this last outrage upon the people of the
State. He that does is worse than a
slave.
Let every honest man be upon his
guard to ward off the assassin attacks of
this desperate band of bullying swindlers.
EXPLORING EXPEDITION.
Discovery of a New Continent.?An
arrival in New York, from New South .j
Wales, has brought tidings from the exploring
expedition. The following letter
from an officer of the Yincennes belonging
to the squadron, is copied from the N. 1
Y. Journal of Commerce.

terminated by ice, descending one hundred
feet perpendicularly.
The weather was, part of the time,
good; and part, blowing from fresh to
heavy gales, with thick snow storms,
making navigation extremely hazardous,
on account of the icebergs by which we
were generally surrounded. I have at
times counted 100 laige ones from the
