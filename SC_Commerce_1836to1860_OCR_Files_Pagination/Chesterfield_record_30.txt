Mr. G race, a citizen of this interesti
country, brings further news from the b
liferents. The Toxin nanny, lSOOstroi
under ihe command of Brigadier Genei
Husk, was on the east side of the Color
<lo river on the lfcth of May, preparing
-cross and follow the Mexican invudors >
their retreat, and prevent them from ta
tag off any property. The Mexican an
under Fihisola, above 3000, were on t
w*est side of the Colorado, in the most i
tjdomble condition, having 1000 sick a
wounded and the balance in a.state of st;
vation. By this gentleman's account,
also appears that General Filasola sein
request' to General Husk, begging to
permitted to keep the 300 or 400 beevt
(then in possession of the Mexicans) a
stating that,'if allowed to do so, he woX
not only pay for them, but consider t
granting of Ju s application a$ a debt
gratitude. General Husk (with the h
inanity that ever characterises the hrai
and which is so little known in the Me:

prodiKXxl no extraordinary sensations in I
minds of the citizens;
Mexico and Texas.?A passenger wlro a
rived from Opelousas, says the N. O. B
of the 30th alt., brings the news that C
Wall, the commander of a strong Mexic
division of 1200 men, had, at the requesl
Santa Anna, surrendered himself a prist
er, with his whole force, to about 300
400 Teiians. The same pa per says, it v
also st;ited tiiat the Tesian force, un<
t'??L had overtaken the in
division of the Mexican army, under Fe
sola and Sesma, when crossing the Co
rado, and that the Mexicans merely
quested to be undisturbed in their rctn
from Texes. It was furthor stated, tl
the Mexicans had thrown a large quant
of ammunition into the river, lest it shot
fait into flic hands of the Texians, a
that the fatter had prudently pursued I
policy of building a bridge for the i
cape of the former, who were still three
one.
The Bulletin, of the same date, sta
that a highfy respectable citizen of Te:
Arrived the evening before, by the way
Red River, who brought intelligence, ei;
days later than had previously been
ceived, and who stated, that on the 11
inst. the Mexican army was rapidly I
troatingVin disorder, having thrown a Jai
number of muskets into the San Fcrnai
lliver, and that a large number of Texit
had visited the Mexican camp on the C
.onulo, andslept (here one night, and tl
the Mexicans treated them more like th
conquerers than their- captives, and t
'hnm only a'.Iovwd ?o ret;.
\& ! unmolested fhey would never trouble the
or, j Texiaus again. The same informant adgs
I ded that a Tex inn met Wall, the well
by I known French General in Santa Anna's
? service, on the prairie, who said, on being
- i questioned, that he was proceeding to see
| what kind of a treaty Santa Anna was
about to make with the Texians, when he
as was taken into camp, and detained as a

01 From tlie New Orleans Observer,
u- It is stated that the Mexican forces arc
of : again concentrating on San Antonio de
Bexar, preparatory to making another atm
! tempt to overcome the Texiaus. This is
en certainly more probable than the previous
de j accounts of their retreating in coiffusion
from tiie country. Their forces already
; in Texas are stated at five thousand,
an j W'c are told that Santa Anna has bardie
lv recovered from the surprise which lie
'o- ; felt at not having been instantly executed,
le- in revenge for the barbarities which lie
rs. had committed upon the unfortunate prisoners
that had fallen into his hands. In
, this the Texians have done nobly. Their
! forbeanmre in this instance, is the most
*r- i glorious victory ot the two. It will icuch
ik, ( to their enemy the broad distinction be
? f t
on , tween savage and civilized wariare, ana
he j will confer on themselves a lasting honor,
es which could not have been earned by

a'u from .Shackelford, at Tuskeegee. The
Indian chief IIopotii Yoiiolo was in
f'?- communication with Tuskeegee at the
rCw head of 300 friedly Indians, and had

tiles. Ofuskek Yoiiolo, a chief, who
ity ' came in as friendly, was denounced as a

j poth Yoholo. On his way he attempted
; to escape, and was killed. The friendly

Fort Ingcrsoll, (A/a.) June 5, 1830. G
Five Indian runners sent to Neah-Mic- K
co's camp, returned to-dav, and report, j N
that he had gone to Chambers county, 1 at
to surrender himself, accompanied by 50 j st
friendly Indians. Subsequent informa- j
j tion contradicts the rumor of ISc-ah jMicco's
intention to com* in, & represents him
i as still maintaining an equivocal attitude.;
A white flag is still living where he has j gjplaced
himself, but many hostile Indians i to
are said to have assembled there. Aes-:D
j terday, Capt lloxie's Independent compa-1 c(
! ny of Artillery, accompanied by Uapt. u<
Bush's mounted Infantry, proceeded to w
; scour the country some six or seven miles ac
j below this place. They came upon a
j small camp of two or three Indians, that j qi
j bore marks of being recently deserted.
I A soldier from Fort Mitchell, states!
! that the Indians were committing depreda- j ot
. lions on the Alabama side, within a mile { re
j of the Fort. j C
j An express arrived this evening in Co- ; in

Indians attempted to cross the Chattahoo- ' M
chee at Boy kin's Ferrv. They were dis- t
: covered about day light as they were ! tl
launching their Canoes, by a small Picket,
j stationed tlierc. The guard fired upon j g
: them and the Indians returned the fire, j P;
j A smart engagement ensued. The Pick- | k
i ct consisted of seven men. The Indians

are variously estimated; noiu ov/ iu -tw.
i The probability is, that there about 40 or ti
i 50. One white man was wounded slight- , 1;

; Capt. Baker, iu command of a company
j of Alabama Volunteers, reached Coluni- j 0
J bus this evening. He reports that the ; n
j destruction and rapine on the plantations ! P
above this, is almost incredible. The In- j

Sl'LT OF THE INDEPENDENCE OF TEXAS.
From the Boston Gazette,
i":?:? nc inHpnnndpnt. what
? lUlVIII^ JL uu ,
II be its effect upon this country, and in
rticular upon New England? Most asredly
it will tend to a rapid settlement
Texas, and open its ports to a valuable
mniercial intercourse with our own Atitic
cities. The people of the Southern
d Western States have manifested great
ihusiasm in favor of the Texian cause,
it we apprehend that the relative effects
the revolution will operate more beneially
on the North, than on the South,
te inducements held out to settlers, in
s shape of lands of the most fertile chapter,
and adapted to the cultivation of all
aront southern startles* will attract
b' " ?i ?? ?
>re powerfully Southern planters, and
; consequence will be, that the main porn
of emigrants will go from the South1
States. Marvlanders, Virginians, Cainas,
and Georgians, will be anxious to
ive their own worn out lands, for the sajrious
climate and more fertile soil of
:xas. The remote tendency will be, to
nsform Maryland and Virginia into noniveholding
States. Be this as it may,
j Southern and Western States will
tinly contribute to the peopling of the
w Republic.
But without losing so large a proportion
population, our northern cities will paripate
in a more extended and active
nimercc; our carrying trade will be aug:nted:
the crops of cotton, rice, and sur,
will be increased, and the products of
xas, cultivated by natives of the United
?tes, will be poured into our great marts
commerce, with an abundance hitherto
known.
Viewed in this light, the victory ofGe al
Houston will operate beneficially
>n the manufactures of New England,
affording more extended markets for
ir fabrics: it will be favorable to our
shipping merchants engaged in the carrying
trade, and to the whole northern community,
in augmented supplies of southerA
products. In short, every new field of
commerce and enterprise, contributes es
sentinlly to the prosperity of the active
population of New Kngland. Taking a
comprehensive survey of the subject,
therefore, the Texian revolution bids fair
to become a source of greater benefit to
the northern than to the'Southern Stales.
?Thus far, in a business point of consideration.

0^* There is truth and good sense iu
i the following, from the Boston Morning
Post: i
Advertising.?^Onc great cacse of the j
commercial nrosnerity of New Vork is the \
I " ~ .? r ?
! practice, prevalent among an tue nier1
chants there of advertising' their goods in
the newspapers,?an exsmpk which might i ;
be followed, with great advantage else- * i
where. The newspapers of this city convey
to the strangers very imperfect idea
of the amount of business transacted with- , v
in its limits Out of-town merchants t
ought not be expected to grope their way \ I
from wharf to wharf, or from street to
street, to hunt up the goods which they
ma* wish to purchase?the newspapers of * ~*
I the day ought to be a never failing direc- I
j tory in which they can look with confi. q
, dence for an inventory of the stocks in
j market. If this be the case?as it is not
| here?the stranger could buy with much
' greater facility; and many who now go to
j other cities, would leave their cash w ith
us. ; ; .
Beet Sugar.?A method has been
lately discovered in Westphalia, by which
10 pounds of sugar, perfectly crystallized
can be extracted from 100 lbs. of the beetroot
in twelve hours. The secret was immediately
purchased for 20,000 fr. with
' the condition that it should not he used he'yond
the provinces of the Rhine and
Westphalia. J
