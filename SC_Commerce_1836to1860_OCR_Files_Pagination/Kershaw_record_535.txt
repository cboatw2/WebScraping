Bill cannot pass the Senate. Rives, I

WASHINGTON, July 13, 1841.
?* ... In the Senate the morning h ?ur was or- ;
cupicd in discussing the propriety of pas- ]
sing a bankrupt law at this session, which ,
terminated without any thing being elicit- |
?d which woiiM show a probability of j
its even being seri<Misly considered at pre- t
sent. The Bank bill waR then taken up \
L; and Mr. Wright moved to amend the first \
section bv striking out the 100,000 shares i
to be subscribed by the Government. He <
said he had listened in vain for any nrgti- }
> * ment in favor of the connection of the <
I . - Government with this Bank.' But recent- j
ly we had been told the Government was i
deeply in debt, and now we are to be |
sunk ten millions deeper in debt to purchase
Bank stock. Mr. Clay replied with t
considerable petulence, and intimated that i
, the object of the Democratic members in j
the amendme.nts they proposed were to (
render the bill odious, ar.d for prorrasli- .
nation. He alludpd to the long time the i
bill had been beftTre tne Senate, and the |
necessity of prompt action for the relief of |
_ the country. Mr. Wright replied to the
charge of offering amendments with a view j
to rendering the bid odious, and showed its (
injustice. Mr. Calhoun followed, and after i
expressing his surprise that such a charge
should have beeu made, and showing that <
' < of the twelve days the bill had been b- ,
fore the Senate, eight of them had been t
consumed by its .friends, and fmr only by i
its opponents. But he thought there wa> ,
something further intended bv the Sena- (
tor from Kentucky, and he wished him to i
stale whether his remarks were intended s
?, *- as precursor to n measure for ahriding the j
rigm 01 oiscussion in me senate. jvir. <Clay
replied with much vehemence, thai j
v he was reaily in bring forward, 10 support,
and to vole for a measure which i
- would put the business of the Senate in s
the power of ihe majority. The people r
of the country were crying out in agony, |
"action, "action," and they would stand j
by those who would endeavor to pul an t
end to the interminable discussions which (
Senators seemed disposed to indulge in. ^
Mr Calhoun said th' Senator might hiing t
on his gagas soon as he pleased. The op- t
position wonld not lie deterred from exer- r
cising all their rights, and would not say
one word less in consequence of the Sen- ]
ator. Under the plea of "action, action"
the Senator was endeavoring to force f
through that body a series of measures i" ,
which were involved the principles which c
jiad separated parties from the begining (J
ofTlTe~Gnveromcnt, nnd which it would ?
require four full sessions af Congress to ,|
discuss fully. The Senator said the agon- (
ised "people were erj itig "'action, action," ,,
but he understood the cry too well to be t
deceived. The cry cawe from the specu- j,
lators who wished relief at the expense of
the^mmuuiiy, and he never heard the
cry(tX "action, aetion," by the Senator, p
but it sounded to him like "plunder, pluti- (j
der.-" He .repeated, that the minority M
nad no liiieiiuon to procrastinate debates. ,,
They anxious to pet home from whence j,
they dragged to this city by the impa- s
tience of gentlemen to force their mea- n
sures on the country; but tlieir wislips v
would yield to their sense of duty to their ^
country, and they were detetmined that
no measure should be run through that
body until it received a full examination,
and if the Senator imagined that thi*
would be prevented by his menace of a
gap law he would soon find his mistake. ii
Mr. Benton, Mr. Linn, Mr. Walker, ^
Mr. Wright and Mr. Buchanan followed "
in a similar spirit, and must have convinced
Mr. Clay that his attempt to gag v
the Senate will fare differently from what <1
it did in the House, it is to be regret?ed s
that the Democratic members in that bo- 1
<fy, embracing as thpy do, so much talent, t
should have permitied themselves ro be so I,
effectually muzzled. The House is nou t
in fact biffc a mere Whig faction, employ, c
*<1 in registering the edicts of Henry |
Clay. t
Mr. Wright's amendment was negatived '
?as was another which he proposed, to I
strike out the power to subscribe for the I
one third of the remaining twenty mil- I
lions, in rnse it was not taken by individu* I
als. Mr. Clav in some of bis remarks i
denounced the doctrine of repeal as Ja- I
cobinical and monstrous. Mr. Buchanan
repl'ed wiili much ability and showed that .
it was not only constitutional but had i
been recognized by the Supreme Court,
Judge Marshal) delivering the decision.
In the House, Mr. Jones of Virginia
made a most powerful speech in opposition
to the bill establishing a National I
Debt. He was followed by Mr. Atherlon <
on the same side of the question, and by
^ * . ?? TV .U - ,
Mr. Uuvis nmi Mr i/awsou un mr

of the bill, and at the close of his remark?,

DF.CIsION IN THE CASE OF M'LEOD.
The Prisoner not Discharged.
An Extra from the office of the N. Y.
American contains the Opinion of the Supreme
Court of this Siale, sitting*al Ulica,
in the matter of Alextnder M'Leod, who
claimed to he discharged from custody, on
the ground that the offence with which he
is charged, was a public act, performed in
,r<inrc fr,.m officers amioint
e<I by the British government, and that the
act bad since been adopted by that government
as its own act.
The Court have decided against the
discharge of the prisoner without a trial.
Fhe opinion of the Court was delivered
t>y Justice Cowen. It tills nearly eight
jolumns in the American. The condoling
paragraphs are as follows:
When a Grand Jury have charged that ;
t man has committed murder in this State.
[ can imagine no case, whether tlm charge
elate to the time of open public war or
>eare, in whirh he can claim exemption '
rom trial. If lie show thai he was in \
ruth acting as a soldier in time of public 1
var, the jury will acquit him. The judge
A'ill direct them to obey the law of ua- 1
ions, which is undoubtedly a part of the '
romrnon law- So, if the accused were 1
irtingin defence against an individual in- 1
rader of his country. But above all things (
s itimporlant in the latter case for the ju- 5
y to inquire wiielher his allegation of de- 1
ynce be not false or colorable. '
They cannot allow as an act of defence,
he wilful pursuing even such an enemy,
hough tlictated by sovereign authority,
nto a country at peace with the sovereign \
>f the accused, seeking out that enemy 1
ind taking his life. Such indeed, can be i'
nothing but a violation of territory, a vio- |'
lation of the municipal law, the faith of '
treaties, and the law of nations. !
The government of the accused may ap
irove, diplomacy may glaze, but a jury
'an only inquire whether he was a party '
o the deed, or to anv act of illegal vio- t
ence which he knew would probably en*
langer human life. If satisfied that he J
,vns not ?s I sincerely hope they may Ik, 1
ipon the evidence in the case before us,
hey will then have the pleasant duly to ?
irrfortn of pronouncing hint not guilty.? <
tut whatever may be their conclusion ?e
eel the utmost confidence that the pri nier,
though a foreigner, will have no 1
ust cause to ci.rnplaiu that he has suffer*
d wrong at the hands of an American <
? i
ury.
At our hands the prisoner had a right i
o require an answer upon the. facts pre- ^
ented by bis papers, whether in law he i
:an properly be holdeti to a trial. We *
lavehad no declaraiion but to examine and 1
ironounce upon the legal character of 1
hose facts, in order to satisfy ourselves of H
lie hi aring they might have on the novel f
ttid important question submitted. That v
xammmion nas ten m me conclusion that n
ve liave no power to discharge the priso- h
ter. v
He mnst, therefore be rpmanded, to lake r
lis trial in the ordinary forms of law. a
The effect of this decision will be, to s
ause the prisoner to lie tried on the indict- (t
nent, by a jury, unless the casein its pres-. c
>nt lorm should he appealed to the Court] v
if Errors,[the Stale Senate.]as we hnve'd
inderst"od it would be, in the event of a.c
leeision like the present by the Supreme I
'onrt of New Y->rk, and should the Court b
if Errors affirm the present decision that g
hen the case would he carried up to the Su- b
i re rue Court of the United Stales. si
It must be understood that the only ques. f<
ion before the Supreme Court was, wheth- o
r the prisoner should, or should not, be a
ischarged without trial. The decision o
fas delivered at Utica on Monday fore- ?
oon, & was brought by express to Albany c
y Mr. Lacy, of the Albany Daily Adverti- h
er office, who left Utica ;n an extra loco- l'
lotive soon after 12 o'clock M. and arri- c
ed at Albany in season for the 7 o'clock

" Dear Sir ;?Itijecomes my duty to in
form you of one of ihc most powerful re
vivals of religion that we have ever wit
witnessed. A foul* day's meeting was ap
pointed to be held in the Church at thi:
place, commencing on Thursday the firs
of July, which, being the second quarterly
Conference for the Cokesbury Circuit, wa
attended by a goodly number of Minister
from different parts of the Stale. Tin
meeting progressed, with some manifests
lions of Divine power, until Sunday eve

its close; but, by this lime, the excitemen
had become so general, and the tone o
religious feeling so deep and strong tha i
was thought advisable to protract the ser

unanimous consent. The operations of tin
Schools were suspended?-the farmer laid
aside his implements of husbandry?tin

tears, and cotintenanceslilup with heaven
born smiles, exhorting those around them
Lo seek a pardoning God and go to Heaven
with them. The Ministers seemed dollied
with a double portion of zeal, and preached

Sunday night last, which included eleven

Holiday night, William Ferguson Jr., an
ndicaied burglar, effected a most daring
t wonderful escajie from the nothernjail,
11 which he was the only prisoner. He

that he had riped out the stout wire

stored there, got up into the attic,
'here the two chimney flues meet, and
iseharge their smoke into the common
hitnney, which rises through the roof,
le hail to pre?s up a strong iron gating
efoie he could get into the chimney. Iti
etling ?m at the top, he displaced some
ricks, and then ran the fearful hazard of
liding down the steep roof, and dropping
set foremost on the projecting shade of

ccomplished this dangerous feat,he rested
n the iron stays of the shade, while-he

PIRATES AND ROWDIES.
The N.O. Picayune, furnishes an ac
num 01 tne examination oT Du Puytron
i the Police Court of the second Municialty
on the various charges of piracy,
lave-tradingand perjury. He was held to
ail for trial on the two latter?the first
Image of piracy, being yielded during the
xamination. The charge of perjury resid
on Du Poytron's taking a Custom
louse oath that he was a citizen of the
Inited States, whereas it was alleged he
-as a foreigner. A curious scene graced
'tis part of the examination. Mr. Peyton,
trmerly a great whig member of Congress
rorn Tennessee, but who has since transited
his rowdyism to the bar of New
Irleans, acting as counsel for theprosecu
; ' :" *' vM*v 'M'-.-rX* ..
I lion, took up what purported to be the
last will and testament of the prisoner, in
which he describes himself as born in the
Island of Madeira?and affirmed that the
authenticity of the dncume >i had been admitted
bv Mr. Johnson, the prisoners
counsel. The latter interrupted him, and
dented that he had made any such admission.
Mr. Peyton repeated his assertion,
and Mr. Johnson his deniul.
Mr. Peyton. Do yon mean to say sir,
that I have misrepresented you?
Mr. Johnson. If you persist in imputing
to me words I have not used, and a
meaning which I disclaim and |deny, you
certainly misrepresent me.
j hereupon Mr. Peyton turned upon him
one look of melodramatic ferocity, raised
, his hand and gave Mr. Johnson a verj
I palpable slapin the face. Great confusior
1 followed?the Court looked wild, the audi
- ence huddled anil shuddered and the criei
bawled like a bull calf. Mr Johnson remained

ly well where 1 am.' Mr. Peyton insisted
. that he meant not the slightest disrespect
- to the Court by the little deviation from
- the usual bussincss forms which he had
- felt it necessary to make. A queer child,
s this Baillie Peyton. A few days since
t in the trial of the famous Gaines case, the
f Judge derided a point of law against him,
s at which he was so incensed that he rolled
s up. his books and papers, tucked them uns
der his arm and sailed out of court in a
- blaze of indignation like a comet in (Jog
- days, leaving his clients to argue their
r own cause.
I But the conclusion of the smiting scene
f is the best of all. Mr. Peyton is a great
t Clay man, anil has evidently studied the
- Kentuckian'8 whole tactics?his retreats
r as well as his onslaughts. We extract the
3 last scene?the mdasses thick laid on to
I heal the pepper and mustard?from lh?;

I AMICABLE ARRANGEMENT OF AN UNPLEAS1
ANT DIFFICULTY.
The unpleasant occurrence which took
place in the Police court of the Second
l" Municipally on Tuesday, has, we are happy
to learn, been amicably arranged.
' At 12 o'clock, yesterday, Mr. Johnson,
; accompanied by Mr. Richanl Ilngan,
entered the officp, and immediately after,
1 Mr* Peyton with Mr. Prentiss of Vicksburg,
made their appearance.
Mr. Peyton then addressed the court,
J stating that he wished to apologise to his
honor for the breach of order which oc.
currcd yesterday.(Tuesday,) and he availed
himself of that opportunity of doing so.
To Mr. Johnson, also he had an apology
to offer, and he cheerfully made it here
. (L? tho court) where the insult had been
given. The insult originated in a misconception
on his pari of the language made
use 01 on the occasion by that gentleman,
and he hoped the apoiogy now offered
would prove a sali-factory one.
Mr Johnson replied, that to him the
apology was perfectly satisfactory. Mr.
P. then offered Mr. J. his hand, and a full
reconciliation ami a burial of the past
seemed to be at once effected.
Information Wanted. The editor of
the Boston Daily Mail asks the following

Did you ever know a young man to hold

Did you ever know a man with a shocking

| HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, l.bi.The
coming regular session of Congresr w$l;
have as important questions (if they "may net .even ^
bo consiuered moie go) to settle, as those which
art now under discussion, hi the present extraor- * dinary
session.
Among these questions, thore are none, in our ' 'i-r
opinion, more important to the peace, happiness, and
dignity of tho country than the settlementof. >* ^
the ratio of representation; and there is no question,; .
of equal magnitude, which excites leas attention
among the people.
Tho present House of Representatives, H it 6e~'lieved
by many, is too large for all the practical
purposes of legislation, and unless some principle
is adopted at an early day by which the number may ' **>V
bo reduced, or at all events some limits 10 tneir in- /
crease defined, it will assume yet more than If ha?- _V%jy
already done, the character of a mob.
According to the. late census, if the ratio be fixed. "
at 60,000, it will give 219 members; if at 70,000;
214; if 80,000; 186, at 90,000; 164 members.
Oao of these numbers will of course bo adopted,
and it is a quostion upon which the people ought
not only to think, but to make some emphatic CX*
press ion of opinion. For our own part we liavo na'
hesitancy in advocating the necessity of diminishing V'-V1'
the number of the House of Representatives, and .
we tliink if llio ratio of 90,000 is adopted, it will'
make the number none too small, but on the corftrary
that number will be amply sufficient-to give a.
thorougli discussion to all questions which may
arise, while at the same time it will not be so large
as to embarrass and retard the progress of business... i
The advantages to be derived from the adoption;
of such a ratio, are manifold. Wc will not efttefr.r.%^
at length into their discussion, but just simply".' *">7"
