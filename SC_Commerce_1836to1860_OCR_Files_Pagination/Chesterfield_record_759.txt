Sbchkt Party Associations.?We
hnve before us a sheet containing an account
of the proceedings of a meeting ot
Democratic citizens in the Eighth Ward,
*?m|M cot iij? swilie Ot OUT DeSl BOU SOUiiUval
democrats, in which an able report on secret
combinations was made, accepted,
and ordered to be printed. The report
gives the following account of the practices
often resorted to by associations oi
men acting secretly, with an understanding
among themselves, to turn political
elections i i some wajr to their private
advantage:
" The mode of operations which our
political cliques generally pursue in order
to accomplish their selfish ends, is worthy
of a brief description. Their main
abject of course is to fill every public office
with creatures of their own?with
men whom they can manatee. To effect
this object they practice two simple arts
of mysteries, via:?1. The art of "making
[political capital" for their instruments ?
and, 2. The art of "politically killing"
any man who, from his talents, integrity
and weight of character, may be likely
to stand in their way. The first named
art is practiced thus: After deciding in
iccret conclave as to the individual to bo
exalted, (generally selecting seme pliant,
tempered soul, with w many negii
live virtues as may be, and none o'.her)
the confederates go about to the different
places of public resort, everywhere casti.
ally remarking that Mr, Sueh-a-one is
becoming quite popular?that they hear
him talked of very generally for such an
office, and he will no doubt get the nomU
nation, Ac. They discuss his merits
with great apparent indifference and candor?think
on the whole he would be a
rery strong candidate?that he has many
friends who will be greatly dissatisfied,
and perhaps create a split, unless he is put
on tho ticket?and so on, according to
SirAiiMnlanMaa ewJ IKA *1*?
??fU lira M7UI|rai VI IUV pvi*
wn addressed. Soon the man actually
is talked of for the office by persons who
do not see the collusion and have no connection
with the conspirators; so what
was a pretence at the start, becomes a reality
in the end. Thus, while each citizen
knows that no fhr as As is concerned.
Mr. Such-n-one is at beat an object of utter
indifference, he is led to suppose that
the great body of the party are vory anxious
for his nomination. Each one accordingly
stifles his own views out of complaisance
to the supposed partialities of
the majority ; w hile the real feelings of
almost every individual in that majority
correspond exactly with his own.
This farce is no less adapted to a large
theatre than a email one. For instance?
the Democracy of the city are industriously
persuaded that Mr. A. (of whom
they know little or nothing) is the strong.
381 candidate for Governor?that all the
farming districts are excessively anxious
for his nomination?and they therefore
luppress their preferences for Mr. B.,
whom they do know to be an able and
trusty man for the station. Go among
farmers along the rivor, and you will find
that they intend to support Mr. A. instead
of their favorite Mr. B. on account of his
l$reat popularity at the north and west,
[n the northern and western counties,

rupposed preferences of other sections,
that the real preferences of all sections

of associating together, they have
of the means exerting a strong influence
in regard to ear nominations and appointments

brief passage from the report, giving tho
symptoms of a political conspiracy, is
storthy of attentive reflection :
' 44 The existence of a political conspira.
, ay may be established thus : All disintereked
men, in selecting either a private or
peblie agent, invariably ask, is he honost?
is he capable T?and when free from any
Ovil design or unjust bias, they invariably
vote for the man whom they think to be
most honest and most capable. It is only
when men desire an agent who will betray
his public trust for their individual
profit, that they can ever knowingly
place a knave or an imbecile in power.
If, therefore, political power be ever con.
ferred in a republic upon one notoriously
dishonest or incapable, the bare fact of his
elevation is proof positive of collusion?
of conspiracy ; as it is impossible to account
for the.fact in any other way.**

THB TIMES.
While every body complains of the
stagnation of business, the derangemont
of the currency, the destruction of our
commerce, and the ruinous prices of ag.
riciiltural produce, but very few bear in
mind the causes of this state of things and
the only efficient rcmody.
That our present misfortunes are the
result of bad government and party legislation,
all are compelled to admit who
know any Iking of the matter; and the
question very forcibly presents itself to
tho consideration of every reflecting man,
wheather under existing circumstances,
it is either wise or safe to suffer that party
to return to power, to whose legislation
may justly be traced all the embarrass.
moats of our position.
> In looking into the past history of the
i country, wo find that when Gen. Jackson
> took his seat in the Presidential Chair ir
1829, Commerce, Agriculture, and Man,
ufactures, were all in the most flourishing
condition. The Bank of tho United
, States was in the full vigor of usefulness
| and tho country was blessed with the vorj
best currency ever known in tho historj
of the world. The notes of that ndmirn

[ wer? alweya, ckerv where at par. except
foWho purpose of dcposito in Banke, when
bill* on the most distant Branches, could
be converted into specie by the payment
! of half per cont discount. Now, as we
" before said, tho world never bolore saw
such an equalization in the valuo of cur- I
rency as existed at that period in the U?* 1
t nited States, and which, but forbad logis
lationand the most wicked management, i
would have existed at thia day. i
One of the first1 objects of those who i
feund them solves at Washington, appen.
, ded to the administration of Gen. Jack- 'i
son. was to- ocroetiintn the noivnr iliov I
I ? I?I I " J
? had obtained. They wero ninatly a band I
of uneducated adventurers, ignorant of I
the world and of Government, and fully
prepared to illustrate tho old adage?-"put
1 a beggar on horsoback, dec. &c." They
were out of position?a sot of Goths and
Vandala in the midst of a civilization they
> could neither understand nor appreciate;
I and in their ignorance, they trifled with
t Government somewhat after the fasHion
; of raonkies in a China shop, and with the
same result. They saw tho immense
power and influence of the Bank of the
United States; but ignorant of the delicacy
of the mechanism which kept that
great maohino in inulion, they foolishly
supposed that it was a species of perpetual
motion?a kind of national clock which
only required winding by official hands,
to insure its running forever. Liko chil1
dren gazing upon the steam engine, thoy
only saw its power without for a moment
dreaming of the absolute necessity of
keeping every portion of it in perfect order,
to insure its working. In their ignorance
and mad determination to retain
power, they determined to seize upon
the Bank, and convert its power and
patronage to the party purposes of the administration.
At this time Gen. Jackson,
Martin Van Buron, Isaac Hill, Blair,
Lowia, Kendall, and every man or demagogue
in and about tho administration,
was in favor of the'Bank and determined
upon its ro-charter. Gon. Jackson and
Mr. Van Buren wero so pro-cmincntly
its advocates, that both of them had ap.
plied to Mr. Biddlo for an increase of its
Branches?Mr. Van Buren asking for one
at Albany, and Gon. Jackson seeking for
a Branch at Nashville. But we speak
advisedly when we say, that all were in
favor of tho Bank and its re-charter?for
at that period we woro their associato and
political friend, thinking as they thought
upon this subject, and as is well known,
separated from thembocause they, one and
all, abandoned their principles, and sought
. n.. i jL. ?
io aosiroy mcuanK me very moment mat i
they were not permitted to control it. c
While all wus friendship and kindness *]
toward* this great National Institution, r
Isaac Hill?a demagogue who would have t
done honor to the Dantons and Marata of [
the French Revolution, resolved that the I
President of the Branch Bank at Portland, r
Maine, should be removed from hia posi- c
tion, and a cretureof his own bo substi. c
toted. He satisfied the conscience keop- c
or* of Gen. Jackson of tho policy of this \
measure and the necessity of having tho <
Bunk under the control of the administra- t
tion j and atreightway Mr. Ingham the i
the Socretary of the Treasury, addressed a ]
letter to Mr. Biddlc,calling for tho removal j
ofthb President of the Portland Bank. Mr. I
Riddle demanded charges against that offi- (
cer; and when informed that his removal c
was demanded on the ground of his being t
politically opposed to tho administiation ?
of General Jackson, he very properly re- ?
1 plied that in the government of the Bank t
and its Branches, tho mother Board knew ?
nothing of politics, und never permitted 1
the question to enter into their considers, t
tion in administering tho affairs of tho i
Institution. We bog the reader to re. I
mark that we are now detailing what i
has becomo history and susceptnhlo of i
proof. A long correspondence followed <
between Mr. Biddle and Mr. Saml. D. i
1 Ingham; and if wo are properly advised; I
that gentleman has recently remarked <
i that he looks back upon that period of his i
public life as the only one he would desire i
to bury in oblivion. ,
, In this corrcsponcence Mr. Biddle wns <
strong in his refusal to permit the Govern- ?
' ment to controul the atfuirs of tho Bank ; <
1 it fi ?
anu wen ii was mat tho Dlarats, tho <
Dantons, and (he Sans Culolts who hnd <
followed in the train of Gon. Jackson I
when with his herd of Goths and Vandals <
he took possession of the cnpitol, gravely i
determined they would destroy (hot which
they could not controul and direct. Wo
will do thom the justico to admit however, ;
that they knew not what they di.l. Ignorant
alike of everything connected with i
monetary affairs, with commerce and with
government, they vainly imagined that
the great and complicated mnchine of
government which they had seen work
so well, and nppnrenlly of its own volition,
would continue to accomplish its purpose.
They knew not, saw not, dreamed not,
that there was any science in government;
and that the commercial, tho munufactur.
ing. and tho agricultural interests of the
country were all dependent upon a well
regulated curroncy. In their ignorance
thcreforo, und to gratify their hatred of
tho honest and olile financier, whose far
seeing wisdom fortold the consequences

The intelligent reader need not be told,
that the simple fact that Jackson Legislatures
had, in obodienceto Jackson die- 4
tat on, called into being upwards of four 1
hundred and forty million of Banking i
Capital, did not add to the actual woaith
or capital of tho country one dollar*. But
this immense number of Banks having
been created, and capital diverted from
>thei sources to put them in operation, it
followed of course, that they must loan
aut their money or they could not make
dividends. But it will hardly be contended
that the creation or new banks wilt
create new business. Here were two
hundred and forty million of additional
banking capital seeking employment, but
10 additional business created by it.
What (hen ? Why a struggle ensued be.
ween these banks to find borrowers ; and
is mankind are prone to use money when
>ffcrcd to them, borrowers were found;
mt then followed another struggle beween
the borrowers to find the means of
arotitably employing the sums borrowed,
is we before remarked, the legitimate
>u8inesH of tho country could not be in:reascd
by the increase of banks ; and of
rourse, speculation in public lands, and
ivery conceivable species of property,
vas tho consequence, followed by tho ex*
rnvagnnce which this state of things engendered.
We pause here, and enquire of every
:andid, intelligent man of both parties,
vhether thexo are not well established hisorical
facts? They most certainly are ;
tnd in times like the present, should be
ccnlled to mind and calmly pondered

During tho fictitious state of things
hus created, and the wild speculations

States, governed by individuals among

tent forth under the auspices of Mr. Van

igainst the very Banks which Jacksonsm

struck us a Itlow on the other side
