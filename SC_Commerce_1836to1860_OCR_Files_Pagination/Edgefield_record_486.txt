Correspondence of the CharIcston Courier..
WASHINGTON, Feb. 18.
The Supreme Court Room is now, and
for some time promises to be, the most at
tractive part of the Capitol. The Missis
sippi slave case is on trial. Mr. Clay -and
Mr. Webster are counsel on one side, and
Mr. Cilpin, M r. Jones, and Mlr. Walker,
oh the other. The constitution and laws
of Mississippi prohibit the introduction of
slaves into the state for the purpose of sale
and traffic. The suits are brought to va
cato the contracts of sale in such cases.
Messrs. Clay and Webster sustain the va
lidity of the contracts. Mr. Clay's argu
ment yesterday was of surpassimg clo
quence and power. Mr. Webster will
probaWy be heard to-morrow. The Court
Ias been crowded every day. The Am
istad case comes up nexi.
The House was engaged chiefly to-day,
on the general civil diplomatic appropria
tion bill.
There was a Georgia war, dutiag the
morning, which amused the house very
much. Mr. Cooper, Mr. Warren, Mr. Al
ford, and others of the Georgia delegation
compared notes and defined positions. A
hot debate afterwards took place on that
part of the bill which limits the fees and
emoluments of Distriet Attorney. Mar.
shals, and Clerks, of the several Di tricts
of the U. S., to a certain sim left blank.
It is intended to move to ill.the blank witl:
six thousand dollars.
Mr. H unt, of N. Y., moved to strike out
the provision. M r. Evac3 and other.w higs
spoke in favor of striking out. .
The whigs will not agree to reductions
which arejust now proposed. because they
are coming into a share ofthe spoils.
For the last year, the fees and emolu
ments of the District Atiorney of the South
ern Judicial District of New York, were
$2S,000. and of the Clerk of the same,
$19,000. During the same year, the fcs
of the Marshal of the Southern District ,u1
Mississippi, were $S7,150. It is time that
the pruning hook was applied to these
enoripous monopolies. llow the louse
will decide the question is very doubtful.
There will also be a proposition to limit
the compensation of Collectors.
rhe Virginia Legislature was, I believe,
to determine this day, whether to go into
the election of U. S. Senator or not, at this
session. Mr. Wise, it is reported, Its
gone down to Richmond to promote the
election of Mr. Speaker Hunter to the sta
tion.
The Extra Session has been agreed up
on by the whigs, and has received Getter
al Harrison's sanctiou. It is to take place
on the 17th of May.
The Bank question is the most impor.
tant one to be decided at the special ses
sion. It is reduced almost to a certainty,
that on this question there will be a tie, in
the Senate, unless Mr. Preston should vote
for a Bank, as he probably will do. With
his vote, a National Barnk will ccrtainly
pass the Senate. The House is rather
doubtful on this question.
Feb. 19.
There was a very unpleasant personal
collision in the House to-day, between Mr.
Stanley of N. C., and Mr. Pickens of S.
i ion the1
Whole, animadverted with much severity
on the politics and politicians of South
Carolina, but, at the same time, disclaimm
ed all personal allusions,or personal disres
pect.
This morning, as soon as the Journal
was read, Mr. Hlolmes of Chalestonl, asked
leave to offer some explanations in reply
to Mr. Stanley. Mr. St anley objected and
insisted that the gentlemtan should reply
in Committee of the Whlole, where he
could rejoin. Mr. Campbell said in sub
stance, the member of N. C. is unworthy
of notice. South Carolina has nothing to
fear from his putty arm. Mr. Stanley re
joined-it is strong enough to reach von.
Subsequently, after the House had gone
into committee, (Mr. Eveans in the Chair)
Mr. Pickens took the floor and miadeC some
severe personal remarks on M1r. Stanley,
at the same time vindicatinig South Caro
lina front his assault. Mr. Statnley replied
in the most abusive and insultitng series of
remarks that can well be conceived. WVhat
he said was chiefly, particularly and per
sonally pointed at Mr. Pickens. The
scene became violent and excited-hoth
parties mnenacinig and tiefying eachi othfer.
The regular debate thent wvent on wvitht
out further interruption, and,. I presume,.
that the matter wvill not again be brought
forward in the Ihouse.
There is a rumor that Mr. Pickenis sent
a message of a technical character to Mr.
Stanley, shortly after the collision. It is
mnuce to be hoped that the mediation of
mutual friends, the parties wtill be persua
ded to make mutual concessions and re
tractions, and thtus adjust the ditliculty in
a satisfactory manner, withouit incurring
the penalties of the anti-duelling law.
From the Augusta Constilutionaust.
We htave placed on the first p age of
our paper, thbe report of Mr. P iekens,
Chairman of the Committee on Foreignt
Aff'airs, in relatiotn to the burning of the
Caroline and the arrest of~ McLeod. Tis~
report produced a warm and exci:e'l de
bate, which arose on a motion to print it.
The motion prevailed, and it was orderedl
to be printed by a vote of 1(03 against G8.
Of the representatives from Georgia,
Messrs. Black and Cooper voted fur the
motion, and Messrs. Dawson, llabershatm,
King, Nisbet, and WVarren against it.
Messrs. Mford anid Holt did not vote.
Much has already been written for and
against this report. The federal whig
members of the House of Representatives,
have condemned it as improper and impo
litic, and declared it to be a dheclartion of
war against Great Britain ; and untder such
an impression they voted against the mo
tion to print it. On the othier hand it wvas
raainatained that it was no dcclaration of
war; and that the report containted, with
regard to the burning of the Caroline nad
the arrest of McLoed, buit facts which were
supported by ample testimony.
- We shall not enter ioto an elaborate ex -
amination of this report ; but wye must of
fer to our readers a few remarks upon the
positions ttssumed in it. Wec have read it
a'tecntively, and we must confess that we
... rm u mm rgentmed.-we rdr nt fir'd in it
lhose objections for which it as been ce
ured. On the contrary, we believe that qi
-very American, who has Itle honor of his ai
:ountry at heart, will approve lhe report, t
nd the tone it assumes in vindication of st
he violated rights of Americti citizens. II
With regard to this position of the report, Ii1
6ve are certain that a very large portion of It
he A incrican people will respond to the In
elingwhich dictated it. In reference to is
ihat portion of the report which alltides to i
he grasping ambition of Greant Brit am, the 11
pimjrobation of the people may not be so
general, though at the same time it wil he t;
icknowledged that the policy of that na- (
ion is, in the reporli, truly represcnited and el
Jescribed.
If ithe ambition ofGreat Britain has been 11
rnly represented, why ceisure the report? i1
We say that tlie anbition of that nation i
has been truly represented, and this repre- '1
sentation is supported by every matn who it
has been an observer ofh eventtslor the last il
thirty years. The report is supported by b
almost every press in the country, in re- c<
gard to the policy of the British Govern- p
ment to extend its political and commer- se
cial influence wheresoever it can he dome el
by all the means it catn employ. The re- ol
port of Mr. Pickens is the ceho of public tI
pinion in this cotintry. Now tho ques- h
tion is, can it he improper for Congress to v
xpress an opinion almost universally en
ertained by tle people, while it is not im
proper for that peolIe to ex)ress it ? Fir
nur own part we consider Congress as the 0
rgan of public opinion in our coIitry
and whenever that body proutilgates to
lie world tho well ascertained feeling and
piion of the people, of whom is tle of
ficial organ, it performs a function for p
which it was constituted.
The report was opposed in Congress by i
the whigs, or, as we should say, by he i
ferni porticon of tie whig party; and the it
netmbrs m1ost conSliNueIUs in ibc debatc, a
and who expressed themselves so warmly '
agaitst it, were Messrs. Granger, FihIore, 0
Everitt, and others. But though those
getlemen opposed the rep:rt, the press of
their party were at Ihe same time ltCrm10
expresioti in relard to the ainhition of P
Great Britain, which sustain the posiutiots d
iAsiu med itn ir. Piees' report. While U
the debate was going on in the House of
Representativcs, on the noton to prtltI
the report, the New York Times aud Star, i
of the 16th iustant, a whig paper. was is- n
sued with in nr!icle upon the subject :an b 1
article ably written, which clearly shows
that the writer las been an attentive ob. h
server of the policy puirsued by Great Bri- c
tai; since 1815. The folloniing are ex- a
tracts from the artiele in the Times and
Star, which the reader can compare with I
the positions assumed by 3lr. Pickens in
his report. e
"But no nation has ldded so largely to

WVe have ofitn spoken inthie early numti
ers of our paper of the value of ashes otn
erin soils. From te numerous trials
hich we have miade, we are inclined to
'tk ashes henteficial otn all dry soils; but
i wet andia heavy grounds, they are deci
ely had-they tentd so rnake the soilstill
ire hseavy anid retenitive efmnoistire anid
onseqluently they introduce mxoss. When
n on the sutrface, ons heavy, claycy
rounds, they will often increase the grass
arvert at first. bt as their tenidency is to
render soils more heavy atnd clammiy, they
huld be applied to those otnly which are
gt.
We have hteard some farmers object to
utting ashers on their dry sandy soils, lest
ny should thtus render them still more
ry and light, hut a very little reflection or
xperience many teach any one that the
anlency ofansbes is to reader light soils
ore comtipact; and to make thetm retaini
oistitre through the whole season.
Farmers oin Long island, N. Y., htave
feni puirchasedl leached ashes ini Matine,
nd used them to good advantage. Mucht
fte soil of tat island is sandy, and dhoseo
ses have always 'here operated well.
ht why wsill the farmers en thie Kenne

ttlTer the soap- hoilers to henda them to a,
isancsse ! It is biecatuse mutch of the land
n the h'eninchec i< clayey, and a great.
rood for nothing as a manure. There is
nuch land however on tl:e banks of the
Kennebec that would be greatly improved
)y the use of ashes, but we .vould not ad
ise to put them in large quantities on any
:layey soil. On green-sward land small
luantities of unleached ashes may ofien he
ised to advantage to give vegetation a
itart. These are full of lye, and they effect
very rapid decomposition of all the vege.
able matter within their reaclt-therefore.
:here can Ie no objection to putting small
iunntities of these unleached ashes intr
tills of corn or piotatoes-the lye would
vork well to rot all the decomposable mat
er in tite green-sward. while the quantity
Ised could not much af'ect the soil, after
he first seasoti.
Leached ashes may be purhased in ma
iv parts of btassachuserts for five or six
:ents per bushel-a cart load for a yoke of
)xcn cost one dollar nd a half-on any
7ravelly or sandy soils iwenty loads of
hese to an acre, would le a good dressing
or any crop-and their beneficial effectt
vill prove much more lasting thnn any
kind of stable manure-they will alter iN
ome degree the nature of the soil.
When ashes are used on corn hills, they

we take this early opportunity, to beg of them
not to come in Cn masse" upon us, but pre
serving a systeir. of perfect good order, walk
boldly up to the adjustment and liquidation of
all claims which we may present to them. We
are supplied with a large number of printed
blank receipts, which will be filled up " instan

passing in and out of the office, another door
will be thrown open, through which those who
have " forked orer," may pass as fast nas we
give them our official signatures." We have
deeply felt the importance of such necessary

cidedly unwelcome aspect.
We have notieed, for some time past, that
there has been a tendency toward a a general
decline of prices, of all American products.
And, although we are led to indulge a hope,
yea, a belief that our own staple product, Cot
toin, must experience an advance in price, yet,
we fear, that many of ourPlanters, who are in
debt, are holding back for higher prices, tinder
a belief that they could do better, while the
chance they run, is extremely hazardous, and
may terminate in a serious embarrassment, to
them.
Property of all kinds generally declines, and
must decline, when money is scarce, and at
such times creditors need, and are importunate
for their pity. All this now seems inevitable,
in our present situation, and may as well be
submitted to with good grace, and becoming
patience.
We are of the opinion, that there should be
no obstinate holding back for higher prices, at
least among those who owe; others, can more
justly, if not more wisely, do as they think pro
per. Let every man who owes, sell whatever
lie can spare, and pay his debts, it will be the
best course in any event, bit especially in one
which we think notimprobable-an increase of
e general depression and embarrassment. Mean

Thec A pology teOrse than the Act.-WVe occa.
sionally hear gentlemen apologizing for some
Iegregious bluinder, which they have comnmit
ted, or some uncalled for remark which they
have made at certain periods and places, in
consegitnece of having inidulged too freely in
the tise of the " soul inspiring beverage." We
Ihave however comie to the conclusion that all
apologies in such cases, are useless, and fre
quently make the affair worse, instead of bet
ter, and we are reminded of a curious anecdote,
that may have been before in priint, althongh
we do not recollect ofhaving~ seen it.
A certain king lhad a ccrtauin jester. whlom he
kept according to the fashtioni of the time, to
minuister to his amuscements, lby witty repartees,
and ridiculotis fooleries. One day, the king
was stooping down, to have his face with cool
water, from a golden ewer. While dloinig this,
his jester came softly behind him, and applyintg
his foot suddenly to the kings, tripped him up,
anid prostrated his majesty's highness flat upon
the floor. Th'le king arose in great wrath, and
execrating the poor fool, ordcred his itmmediate
excentioni. Wiherenpon, the unhappy olbject
-oh his displeasure threw himself~ uponi his knees,
andl hesce ched so pitionsly for his life, that his
illtnstrintus manster, consented to grant thme paltry
boon oii condition That condition was, that
the jester, shonl within a certaiin period, per
formi an act eqnally criminal.nand instantaneous
u y make an apology more criminal than the act
it self.
But a few hours had elapsed, before the king
againm stooped to lave his tace ini cool water
from the goldent ewer. Again the jester came
tip softly behind htimt, and precipitated his mia
jesty hieadlong to the ground.
-Tempestuous was the king's rage ; bitt it in
stantly subsided itnto forgiveness and laughter,
whetn the jester promptly exclaimed: "Oh,
dear ! I beg youir majesty's pardon !-I thought
it was your wife !"
