with the medium that the Government is !
willing is willing to receive, to wit: gold j
and silver only. This gold and silver j
must be obtained principally from specie-'
paying banks, in exchange for their notes
in circulation. Now, observe the operation.
Of every thousand persons who
attend the land sales, with their saddle,
bags loaded with specie, not more perhaps
than a hundred will actually purchase,
and not more than one dollar out of every
ten that is drawn from the banks in spe"**K

tie may lie unuaiiy iu|uhvui
you see how, under the operation of this
measure, the banks in the neighborhood
of land sales may be compelled, upon
their approach, with a due regard to their
own preservation, either to curtail their
circulation to an extent that may he ruinous
to the community, or to suspend specie
payments. On the other hand, if you
allow the notes of specie-paving banks to
he received in payment of the public dues
and require a settlement with them forthwith,
the demand upon them will only
be commensurate with the amount of
their notes actually paid into the Treas.
ury. If, instead, however, of requiring
them to redeem their notes with specie
immediately, we were to do so at intervals
of ninety days, a large amount of
their notes would be paid out to creditors
willing to receive them in the intermediate
time, and the balances remaining o
he settled for in specie would genera ly j
be very inconsiderable.
It appears to me, by a regulation of
this sort, that all improper connexion between
the Government and the hanks
would he avoided; and that the danger
of loss to the Government would be too
inconsiderable to be worthy of considerat.on
in the decision of a subject upon
which such great interests depend ; that
the convenience of the tax.paver would
he consulted ; that trade would flourish?
the Government hy its fiscal action,
neither interfering to stimulate nor to
restrain it, but receivirg the notes ofspe-.
cie paying hanks?not with a view to the
interests of stockholders or coip rations,
but with a view to the convenience of the
community at large?allowing o its officers
the same right to reject the notes cf
a doubtful bank that any individual has
in the management of his own affairs.
?
I know it mav be urged that to allow
to the officers of the Treasury the power,
of discriminating between the notes of
different banks, would give them great
opportunities of exercising undue favoritism.
The objection, if true, is of too little
importance to influence the decision of a
question invelving, perhaps, the interests
of trade and the prosperity of commerce.
The objection is, however, more specious
than real; for, if the officers of the Trea.
sury were to receive the notes of particular
hanks and rofuse those of others of
equal standing, where all were equally
current, the partiality would he so mam.
fcst that they would be overwhelmed by <
a storm of public indignation.
I do not design to interfere .with the
existing .aw further than to authorize the
Government dues to be collected in con.
formitv with the joint resolution of 1816,
and, as a necessary consequence, to repeal
that provision which makes it the
duty of every officer or agent of the Goveminent,
after the 30th June, 1843, engager!
in making disbursements on account
of the United States, or of the General
Post Office, to make all payments in gold
and silver only. I do not propose to a!Uw
the arm of the Government to be u el
either for the purpose of stimulating or j
restraining speculation. The enterprise
of the country should be left unfettered ;
" J
its industry should be protected, but not
regulated.
To allow the Covernment money to be
used for banking purposes, or for any
objects of private speculation, as was the
c ase both under thedynasy ofthe United
States bank and under the pet bank deposite
system, is to apply them to purposes
not contemplated in the Constitution
?to pur|>oses for which taxes never can
be legitimately collected.
The unequal fiscal operation of this
Government has hitherto arisen, not so
much from inequalities in the collection j
and disbursement of the public revenue !
upon public objects, as applied to different |
sections ofthe country, as from having i
allowed the public funds to he used for
purposes of private speculation. Thus,
suppose, by way illustration, that $2,000000
are deposited in the banks of one
State, and that only $50,000 are deposited
in the banks of another, with the same
privilege of using it for commercial purposes
until wanted bv the Government,
is it not obvious that the commercial facilities
of that State where the $2,000,000
are deposited will be promoted just
forty times as much by the operation
as of that State where olily $50,000 are
deposited ? The inequality, under such
a system, will frequently be much greater
even than this.
Another evil of the general deposite
8> stem, is, that the stockholders of the
k/tnlra t K 117 l"?nm t Ko IMlKl DO Q TO
UailfV-~7 nun "I'V". inv ^/UUIIV uv|iwi>uamu
made, arc immediately formed into an
organized corps in favor of high taxation,
To effect the same object, their debtors
would soon be enlisted, and, in proportion
as the public deposites increase, this evil
influence would be increased?an influence
most baneful to the productive classes
who pay the taxes and constitute the
true basis of the wealth and prosperity of
the country.
So far as the question of deposite is concerned,
"fee have but two things to consider?
1st, safety of the public money, and,
2dly, convenience and economy in making
disbursements. And, whether the
the public money is speciallly deposited in
hank for safe-keeping until wanted, or
kept in the custody of public officers, as
is provided for by the existing Independent
Treasury law, is a question of mere detail,
involving no principle.
When the sub-Treasury bill was under
discussion, it was evident that the ultras
of all parties desired to see the specie
clause inserted. The Democrats, hccause
they believed that without it, the law
would be valueless; that it would be a
thing without vitality?a body without a
soul. The Whigs also regarded the spe.
oie feature as its only conservative principle
not because they thought it would prove
beneficial in its operation but because thev
thought the decision of the People would
be against it; and that thev would come
into power upon the downfall of those w ho
had been its chief promoteis. And if the
People are now, which I trust they are
not, prepared to bend their necks to the
yoke of a United States Bank, it is be.
cause of the reaction of sentiment occasioned
by this measure, and which was so
great that the whole country previous to
the late election rang with the party warcry
of "any change must be for the better."
I have often heard this measure recommended
to the support of the manufactures,
upon the ground that, hv diminishing
the circulation of hank paper and, producing
low nominafprices in th:s country,
it would tend to reduce the amount of foreign
importations, and give to them the
domestic market. If I was the Representee
of a manufacturing district, I do not
know what influence this argument might
have upon my mind, for it is not without
foundation. But it is an argument against
which, as a Representee from a
planting Stale I protest; for it is in direct
conflict with the principles of free trade
upon which, at the South, we suppose
that our interests depend. Even when
importations are greater than exportations;
so as to place the exchange against this
country, the tendency is to increase the
demand for and to raise the prices of our
exports; because, to pay for the surplus
of importations, our cotton, rice, and to.
baco come into requisition, and the difference
of the exchange is added to the price
of those articles. I have also heard the
specie requirement recommended to the
support of Southern planters upon pretty
much the same argument, to wit: that its
?ffect would be, bv reducing the quantity
of bank paper in circulation, to lower prices
in the domestic market where they
purchased, while the price of their staples
would not be affected in the foreign
market where they sold. I have been
surprised to hear such an argument advanced
in the face of so obvious a proposition
\a that "restrictions upon importations
operate as a check upon exportations."
But admit, for the sake of argument, that I
the demand for our* staples is not af. |
fected abroad by restraints upon importa- |
dons, does not every Southern gentlenrfan
know that there are comparatively few of
>ur planters who can, on their own account,
afford to ship their crops to foreign
narkets ? All our small farmers are
ompelled to sell at the village markets in
heir respective neighborhoods, where the
ihundance or scarcity of money always
ncreases or reduces the competition a-'
nong the purchasers, and either adds to i
>r takes from the probability of full prices.
The time has not arrived for the specie
clause of the sub-Treasury to go into full
>peration, but the time has arrived when

II 111U >"H no IL'|A aicu. I no A %-OpiO KUf V
lecidel against it, and I invite my demo.
:ratic friends to unite with me in giving
jffieacy to their will. It may already be
oo late to prevent th? evil, but, rely upon ;
it, if we refuse to repeal this obnoxious i
measure, we shall indirectly aid in the estublishmentof
a United States Bank?an I
institution not necessary either to the col-1
lection, safe-keeping, or disbursement of
the revenue?an institution the direct
tendency of which is to centralize capital
it particular points to the disadvantage of
large sections of the country?an insti.
tution which, if chartered, notwithstanding
that the flag of repeal has already, in
anticipation, been spread to the breeze,
will be irrevocably fixed upon the country.
For it will not onlv continue
throughout the whole term of its charter,
but, with extensive means at command, it
will so intertwine its operations with the
business of the country as to render it
difficult, if not impossible, at any future
time, to refuse to it a recharter, without
producing a commercial revulsion.
Mr. Campbell contended that the aioption
of the measure which he proposed
would hold out a strong inducement to the
solvent banks to resume specie-payments
ind restore a sound circulating medium to
ihe country, and was proceeding to show
:hat the present derangement in the currency
arose from a concurrence of circumstances
beyond the control of a United
States Bank, when the time r.llotted by
the rule recently adopted, which limits the
speech of a member to a single hour, exaired,
and he resumed his seat.
