We call attention to the appeal of the Acadcmi.
aal Hoeirtjr to be found in our advertising columns.
We Itfp* that, hbrd as the times are, our town will
objected to the reproach of selling the
eenusodknia bouses built for Academies by tho
contributions of the citizens. Money is scarce at
(bit time, but the creditors of tha Society would
probably extend still further the liberal indulgence
Which they have already granted, provided they
saw a prospect of receiving the money duo them
within some reasonable time, without forcing the
bill* of of tho building*. Subscriptions payable in
small instalments might, or at least ought to bo
taken up that would meet tho preacnt engage,
merits. The buildings and lots arc worth at least
twice the smount of the debts; and it is the inter.
est of the community, and especially of parents
who hare ?hildrcn to educate, to save them from
being sacrificed.
Rccxt.ras.NSts or Party Spirit.?In both
branches of tho Legislature of Massachusetts po.
Htieal parlies are nearly balanced. According to
tbe constitution of the State a majority of all the
vote* caul is necessary to constitute an election.?
In Whatdy county tlic vote stood, for one candidate
118, for another 117, for a third 1 and for a
fourth 1. Or course no one was elected, and the
selectmen (or managers) to decided, and refused
to give a certificate to any of the candidates. But
tho man who had the highest number of votes
rent forward and took his seat without credentials.
The intrusion wjs soon discovered and his
seat vacated ; but what is most remarkable in the
case is that the whole parly to which he belonged
voted in favor of his retaining his scat, although
they profess to be peculiarly and preeminently the
people's friends and the friends of such constitutions
and governments as the people may adopt.
We learn front the Chart, ston Mercury that his
Excellency Gov. Hammond has appointed Mr.
Rufri.i, late Editor of tho Fanners' Register, to
mak? an Agricultural Survey of the Slate, which
was authorized by the Legislature at Its recent
session. We congratulate tho Agriculturists of the
State on this sctectiou. The practical t dents and
discriminating good sense of Mr. Ruflin, his long
experience as a planter, end the devotion to the
subject evinced by him aa editor of tho Ktgitltr,
eminently qualify him for the duties of the office.

A shock of nn earthquake which was fdt in the
upper part of this State, and in parts of Georgia,
on the night of the 4th instant, was also felt in
Ohio, Tennessee snd Missouri. In Memphis,
Tenn. snit St. Loan,- Mo, much ulurin was
caused. , (n the latter town a congregation asscinbUd
is one of the churches was thrown into great
commotion. Tlic chimney of a house not far from
the church was thrown down by the curthquakc.
Commodore Joner has been recalled from the
command of tlic squadron in the northern Pacific,
and Capt. Parker ordered to take his place. The
illegal capture of Monterey in California, is doubtless
the reason of Coin. Jones's recal.
In Massachusetts when no candidate for tlic
state aeuato receives a majority of nil the votes
given the election of a senator for such district is
to bo made by joint ballot of both branches of the
state legislature. At the election of last fall scve.
ral-senatorial districts failed to make elections, but
of those which did make elections the Democratic
majority was so great that, on joint ballot, they
gave the preponderance to that party, who of course
supplied the vacancies in the senate; although the
Whiga had a majority of three iu the popular
branch of the legislature.
Neither of the candidates for Governor received
majority of the popular votes. The election
therefore, devolved upon the legislature, who elect,
cd Marcus Morton over Gov. Davis by a small
majority of . Morton had a plurality of 1,1157
over Davis at tho popular election.

We oopj from the Globe the following remarks
by Cob Cixraux, on the report from the Com. 01
mittee of Way* and Moans on the Exchequer ol
scheme of the President. The report recom- ti;
mended that the bill from the Treusury Depart- Hi
mcnt on the subject be not adopted, and gave rise p;
to a debate, in which the Whigs who spoke pro. w
fesscd their continued preference for a Bank, and w
the Democrats their preference for a Subtroasu- I Ji
ry: ' n<
" Mr. CAMPBELL, of South Carolina, did hi
not rise for the purpose of discussing tbo exchequer
project, more than once recommended by the
President, and now reported upon unfavorably by 'c
the Committee of Ways and Means, further than
to say that, in his opinion, it was by no means the 111
most preposterous proposition tliat has been sub.
milled to tho consideration of the American peo- 10
pie , since questions connected with the currency M
have occupied so much of their attention. Even 1X1
if its merits could bo demonstrated, it would proba.
bly huvc but little prospect of success in a Con.
gross, utmost every member of which is pledged, ^
by his previous course, to some other proposition. ^
He had merely risen with the intention (without ,n
entering into the discussion at length) of indirut. c<
ing to his constituents the course which ho should 'JJ
probably hereafter pursue in connexion with sub. Vl
jeets of this churactcr. c<
Mr. C., as his speeches sufficiently testified, c'
had been always favorable to a separation of the w
Government funds from the uses of banks ; but,
when that proposition, so correct in principle, had l"
been connected with another, requiring the public
dues to be collected exclusively in specie, he had
invariably voted against it?believing that such a
requirement was calculated to increase the pressure v<
on the commerce of the country, already almost
loo great to be borne. '
Since that question, however, was last agitated ^
in Congress, a change has occurred. Hunk cir- '
culation, without any oppression on the part of the
Government, has gone on gradually decreasing.
until, in many of the States, tho circulation is re. P'
duced below the specie actually in their vaults.? "
Under lht?* circumstances, Mr. C. believed that ^
the separation of the Government funds from the
business of trade, eve.: if connected with the re- "
quirement of specie, or Government e.rcdits, cxelusively,
in payment of the! public dues, would now
be accomplished, without prmJpcing a shock upon ^
tho commerce and industry of the country. . 1,1
He had made these remarks, not because he sx- j ai
peetcil, during the existence of the present Con- j c:
1 grcss, to change his vote in relation to this subject; w
for having been elected by his constituents with n
knowledge of his previous course, he would scarce. a?
ly feel himself at liberty to do so. But lie wished cd
to indicate to them, by the remarks he had sub. l''
nutted, that in the event of being returned to the at
next Congress, lie would, unless a change occur,
red in our monetary affairs, probably act with the
Democratic parly on this subject, as he hud upon
most others.

Mr. Clay has been in New Orleans for a few til
weeks on privute business. Ho was received and
is treated there with extraordinary marks of re. 01
spect. The display on his reception was said to to
lie the most magnificent ever made in that city.
Committees from Mobile and Augusta have invi- in
ted him to visit these cities before bis return
Itomc, and lie is expected to do so. A public . "t
meeting was also held in Charleston on the 17th j *1
instant, for the purjiosc of manifesting their re- b
spcct for his character and public services, and in. ti
viting him to visit that city also. The Hon. a
IIknuv Mi (tin.eton presided at the meeting, and
it was addressed by Messrs. Bjiyan, Pettiorl*, tl
Yeadon and Coiien. A coinmittoc of 2li were
Appointed to invite Mr. Clay to visit Charleston.
A letter is published in the newspapers from
Me. Buckingham, the former traveller and lecturer a
in this country, dated Limerick, Ireland, Oct. o
1st, 1612, in which he states that although he had o
oven nt irciand inrcc montlis, ami had travelled <1
through the counties of Wicklow, Wexford, Kit- i l?
Kenny, Watcrford, Cork and Limerick, he had 1 ol
not seen a single drunken person. Thin in a pnrt s?
of the country in which drunkenness was a few , t!
years ago very common. The change is ascribed j n
to the recent Temperance reform, which spread in j I'that
country more rapidty than even in this. d
CONGRESS. t,
In the House of Representative* a bill passed on h<
the 17th to repeal the Bankrupt Act, by a vote of fi
140 to 71. Several attempts were made to mo- 1 n
! dify it, with a view of saving it, but they failed. ' ft
' It is considered certain that the bill will puns the : n
j Senate. The House, at the date of last account, !
was engaged u|>on the bill making appropriations
for the army.
In the Senate, nothing of special interest is do. j
ing. Considerable time is taken up daily in re- j occiving
petitions, and sometimes in discussing ! b<
tliein. On the 14th, a fierce attack was made j ill
upon the independence of the Judiciary, by Mr. ' t,(
TxprAN, who offered a resolution proposing an j 81
amendment to tho constitution limiting the term I ('
of the. judges of the U. S. courts to revert years. {
lie contended that inasmuch as the people in this >
country are the sovereign power, the judges and all
other otHccrs ought to be made immediately rub. j (?
jeet to their will. Why not then abolish ull gov- i 'j*
crnment except that of popular or Democratic as- ' w
scmhlies? This is the result to which the Hon. I vj
Senator's principles lead. The resolution was, < rr
however, put to sleep ; hut it received the support }
of eleven Senators, v.z. Messrs. Ai.lbn, Bcnton, ! j>j

The Senate refused, bj a vote of 17 to 522, to 1
der the printing of an extra number of the report I
' the majority end minority of tlio ComMjltcc on i
ie J udioitry on the subject of General Jackson's (
nc. It is evident that no bill on the subject will! I
in at this sesasion. The majority of the whiga ' |
ill not agree to put the bill in such a shape as , i
ill, in their opinion, reflect upon the motives of | I
idgo Hall ; and General Jackson's friends will 1 t
jt accept a bill which proposes chiefly to relieve : j
m, in virtue of his public services.
In the House to-day, the subject of the line was
cussed, during X? morning hour, by Mr. Outr,
of Ky., who w#an aid-de-eamp of Gcnerul 1
ickson, and wIki warmly advocated the instruc- '
[>ns passed for the Committee on the Judiciary. 1
Mr. Kennedy, of Md.. stated that the Commit. J
c on Commerce had under consideration a bill ' 1
ilablishing a warehousing system; and offered a j 1
solution calling on the Secretary of the Treasury j 1
r information in aid of their lubors. 1
The Reports from the Committeo on Ways and ! '
leans on the Exchequer were resumed ; and Mr. ! '
ndcrwood, of Kc.-.tueky,. spoko his hour, dwell. . 1
g much on the state of the currency and the nc- j '
-ssity of resorting to a National Bank, as the on. ' f
remedy for its disorders. Mr. U. also took a . *
ew of the prospects of the Whig party. Ho I )
intended that it was not dead as soine had dc. ! 1
ared. Those who declared it to be prostrate \ '
ere actuated more by their hopes and fears than '
/ tluir convictions. As to the New York clec- '
in, which had been relied on as a proof of the '
ct, it proved only that the Whigs staid away '
am the polls. There were forty thousand votes 1
ss than in 1840. These forty thousand did not (
>te, because they saw no prospect of advancing 1
ic Whig cause and promoting Whig policy.?
lie same thing occurred in Ohio. There the
cmocratic Governor was elected by a minority,
'he Whigs were kept from the polls by the con- i
net of the " guard" and by the " constitutional j
ict." The Whigs would learn wisdom and ex. <
sriencc, and they would select no candidates in .
344, whose principles were doubtful. All the t
isastcrs of the party grew from the election of j
ahn Tyler. He was taken with a view to carry t
ic Stato of Virginia, and the result was a just ,
idgment upon the Whig party for making such a ,
lection. lie firmly believed that the Whig par,*
would be stronger in 1811 than in 181(1. lie
oped that one party or the other would triumph,
! ,' 'hut the policy of the country would be based j
i more sn^'!t-'J principles, und not be left to shift '
iili every breatn faction, and be subjected to '

Mr. Winthmp moved to lay the whole subject
i the table: and Mr. Cusliing moved to refer it '

Mr. Grecnough, the sculptor, is here; and has I

'HE Cheraw Academical Society is now in ?j
iht about <Slf>(K). Since its establishment it c
as expended, for lots, buildings, and repairs, ^
tout 35000 ; besides largo sums of money in y
inking tip to teachers from timo to time de~ c
ciencics in their salaries, aiising from inade
uate receipts for tuition. Though the j
ocicty has heretofore received considerable s
id from citizens and others not members ; yet y
ic principal burden and the whole responsi. y
ility (previous to last year) has always rest- gl
J on those who icere. The Socictv now
insists of few in number ; and at a meeting '
nnvencd this day, it was resolved to cell the
cadi inical Lots and Buildings for the pur* P
:>be of paying the above debt ; unless some
icasures arc promptly adopted by the com- p
mnity to discharge the same. Most, perhaps
II, the members of the Society are understood
be willing to co operate with their fellow
itizrns in this matter; but they are not dis- '
ascd tn do it without their assistance.
The 10th day of next momh is fixed for w
iterming upon the pale; unless, before that ?
tie, the peoplo (with such arguments as satfy
creditors) put their veto upon it. .
