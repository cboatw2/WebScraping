PROFITS OF COW KEF PING. t;
[FROM THK MAINK F.VRMKR.l
Mr. Holmes: No branch of husbandry
is more profitable :hun the keeping of ,
cows,if properly n.waged. We have but
few fhn.vTS i:i the Stn e of Maine. u*iio j
make jjivat prof's by the dairy. Many
iarmor> anions us are solicitous :o improve
their breeds of cows, and some raise consM.arablj
fpnnti ies of good roo s, with
wliicli o feed them during the win'er. Tiiis j
is all verv good, so far ; b r what is the
treatment of cows during be summer sea.
son?the time when alb or nearly ail, the
profits are chained? Cows kept in (
,t.-v. <',ort rins?tiiY><. in siimmtr. will not he
i?r< ii able to their owner, however much
rata baga. mangel wurtzel, or carrots, hav 4
be n (" 1 on' to them during the winter. I <
h dievo it to be a f'ac , tii.it cows, generally, 1
(>iv;ie few exceptions,) are shamefully stin- \
ted in t!:? ir food durmg die summer, in onr
S a e, notwithstanding our grazing lauds j 1
are exoellen'.
I believe that die most profitable way of '
keeping cows through the summer, is bv
soiling, or f citing tirm with grass in
l!ie barn or yard. This may frighten
some farmers, and excite the ri licule
of others; hut I think i: will be gram
te 1, dec he is the b -st farmer who realiz"S
tl.c gr -atest number of dollars an ! cents. J
iron: a given tpian Ify of hand, with the!
least amount ot 1 ibor. Many farmers '
pride thorns !vcs on raising great crops; !
and 100 bushels ot Indian corn have b vn
raised on a single acre. This is a great
ride, bat [ b.veve tint throe thousand
bi:>'i<NS of n a bnga niav lx? as cheaply (
raised, take oae year with another, as 100 ,
bushels <=f corn. Three thousand bushels j
of ni a b :i wii? give about a hushel an 1 .
a half a day, each, to six cows, through- |
out die whole year. It is easy enough to 1
sr T!iat co'As. fid in this way, will he in ,
exc Hen! coudi ion. and yield immense
uunntitus of butt r an 1 clicesc. i
The method o! s > 1:.-jf. as described by !
Mr. Dean, was to feed cows with new
mown grass; an acre of rich ground, be
savs wii! summer a number of cows. A
lit;le lee or grass wiil indeed be necessary
at all dmes of the year, but 1 believe roots
shoal ! be ra^ed in greater abundance, and
be made ihe ci.i* f ar clo for feeding inilch
cows throughout the venr, as fir as practit

quantities of miik tiil Juno; hut b\ supplying
them liberally will roo's,they may
be made to vi Id as much milk in March,
April, and May, as any part of the year.
Farmers, whose cows calve early, and who
have an abundance of roots, may make
prodigious quantities of butter and cheese
early in the spring. how shall t!;e farmer
contrive to have a constant supply of
roots throughout the summer, and until early
root crops are ripe enough for use ?
tliis is a qnes'ion of immense importance. 1
Ru'a baca will k'ep well til! July, and it
is not po-s Mr, ha: by s<?uic kind of management,
this root may be preserved in
?0'vl condi ion n-'arly, or epii e through ihc

I ui'*!:s:imae who buried so*n? potatoes deep
in he earth, sock-op that their vegetation 1
was prevenvd. and the po'ro-s. wtien k< pt !
two or tim e years, were of as goo' flavor
and quality as when first ripe. It is h?
): vod :licit po'.ito*-s unv be kept through
the summer without sprouting, in n comlp.on
ice cellar. It has bo.-n contend. 'I,
that potato' s will not sprout w1 ere ire \v:il
not mob. Chemists pre'end 'o describe
the moans which nature employs in the
process of vcgeating or sprouting. Cannot
chemis ry tell us how some of those
means ?au be withheld, or so managed as
to prevent, or at least re'ard, tl|C sprouMng
of vegetables ? Would not a summer cellar,
made air tight, answer our purpose ? Air
is necessary to the process of vegetation,
and if we exclude air from vegetables, will
they sprout ? Cannot yankee ingenuity devise
some scheme to prevent vegetables
from sprouting during summer? It is to
be In peJ that some of our enterprising
fanners vr.il try various experiments on
this subject, us the accomplishment of the
object above named, would be of immense
advantage to every farmer who cul ivates
roo:s. If i- should he impracticable to preserve
roo's, in good condition throughout
the whole sumni r, I believe that if our farmers
practise soiling, they will realize an
ampl * profit by their cows. At the worst,
tiie fanner may have a constant supply of
roo s f r his cows, except about six weeks,
from the fist of July till the latter part ot
Angus', and during this slmr* pe io.l, lie
may supply his cows with other fo >d A
steam boiler is of immense advantage fo
every farmer who cultivates roo:s. Dr.
Dean says, that a s eam boiler is made by
sett:, g a kettle. holding twelve gallons or
mote, in a furnace made of brick or stone,
arid over this a hogshead, with one head
taken r,ut, and the other bored fid! of holes. '

Farmers in Europe, and in tins country
.have practised soiling their cuttle during
summer, and hose who have bad great ex- i '
penence in this mode of summering, have y
declared it to be a much cheaper and more y
profi able mode than grazing. s'
Much has been said and written, of late y
years, in regard to the great profits of root
culture, but the farmer who keeps a proper j u
breed ol carle. she- p, and swine, and l?'
ulios 'cows iii summer range in a dry, short .,n

however great his advantages may he in ,

A new construction of fiii'ways.?Mr ^
Perkins has exhibited a new plan of rail- ^
wavs. which lie ha> secured bv patent, and "

which from the explanaiion given by liiin,
would appear calculated to supply tlie d<-. ^
sideratum so long desired, and indeed appears
to lorm an era in the progress of
those great national undertakings towards
perfection. The plan embraces two modes
of construction, founded on one common
principle, viz : the continuous support of ^
the rails. In the one case this is eifectcd i
by blocks of vitrifi dearth, as hard and dura,ble
as graniie, and wliicb lock into 0:10anofher,
being laid on a concrete founda- (J
tion; and in the other by an additional C(
depth of concrete supplying the place of e,
sleepers altogether. Upon the former plan, w
wooden bearers, four inches in the base,
four thick, and two wide, on the top, rest .?
upon the veriilled blocks ; and in the lu'ter. ^
upon the concrete, to which they are ltrmly (ll
secured. In both cases, iron burs, with the (,{
ui'-ins afforded lor expansion and con- w

erec'ed at the head of the inclined plane tli
in St. Leonard's depot. I?s object is to en- tc
able the engine-men to have a distinct view tc
of the inclined ropes during the night, and in
this has been fully attained. The lamp l>
consists of an Argand burner, placed in s;
the focus of a large speculum, of a pecul- in
iar form, by which the whole light is (lis- in
tributed just on the space where it is requir- Iv
ed. It is compu'ed that the ]i<fiit on the tn
above space is equal to that of twenty-five hi
or thirty similar burners in common lamps. p<
A lamp of this kind we have no doub' j o
would be successful for other purposes. It' d
eppears to us that the largest assembly- tl
room might be brilliantly lighted by one .A
placed at each end of the room, and one e<

PARASOL AXTS. '
I had heard of the parasol ants previous 1
going to Trinidad, but I could hardly '
dieve the account I had received of them. '
he first morning I was at Belmont, Mr. 1
'artier called me to see the parasol an;s 1
-and sure enough there was a s ring of '
uck ants, about the length of a common !
>uso fly, moving as ants do in England, 1
a long tile; and every ant with a small
t ofa green leaf, held erect over i:s hea . I
never beheld any thing so s*range; not i
ic was widiout the leaf. I heard a s ran. <
t s:ory still, that they plucked these leaves 1
id took tliem down a great way under I
ound. I was informed by Mr. Oilman, ;
' Li Reconnaissance, that his negroes <
tving hy his orders dug in the ants habi- <
ti? it was found full of these same leaves, <
it he red, and. at the bottom of the nest i
ic or two (I forget which) white snakes,
' from nine inches to a foot in length; and
was said that every one who had dug
it these nests had found ilie leaves and
e white snakes. At Laurel Hill we o'orvod
a great many of these parasol ants, i
id Mr. C. resolved to get at the truth. I
ue ants came from the high grounds, a !

THE BRIDE.?A SKETCH. na
Among the crowd who were hastily las
promenading the s'res's on Christmas eve, dy
was Charles Wes; and if his step degenerated
into a stride, and then a run, iie might be
cordoned. Charles West was a new made
K Vgroom. The transition from the dir.
y, cold street to a warm parlor, was in itself da
ileasurable; added to that, to be welcomed a"
ionic bv a bright eyed girl?all smiles and
slushes, (for the honey moon was barely ed
massed) was absolutely too paradisal for the SP'
jarth. Pdmma had wheeled the sofa in s'c
Tont of the fire, and as Charles seated him- 01
Self beside her} he was certainly a very ?
(rippy fellow. Alas! he had as yet only de
[1 rank the bubbles of the cup. Emma |n
looked lovely, for the glow of the coal lire m<
had given a bloom to her usually pale t0
cheek, which lighted the his*re of her dark l)C
eyes. But there came a shade of thought ^1]
over Emma's brow, and her husband in- hu
standv remarked it. I: is strange how 17
soon husbands see clouds on their liege
lady's brows. It was the first Charles ever nn
s-iw there, and it excited the fenderest in- ')U
rjuiries. Was she unwell??did she wish Bi
f??r any thing? Emma hesitated, blushed ha
and looked down. Charles pressed to nc
know what had east such a shadow over co
her spiri s. "I fear you will think me very
silly, but Mary French has been sitting f?"
with mo this afternoon." "Not for that ac
certainly," said Charles, smiling. "Oh I wl
did not mean tliat, but you know we bo- gr
can to keep house nearly a* die same time, na
only they sent bv Brent to New York for
carpeting. Mary would have me walk
down to Brent's store this evening with her. 'j'
and he has bought two, and they are such ho

continued, ".said you were dointj a first eri
rate business, and she was sum you would ?s
never let that odious wilron lay on the par- ac
lor if you once saw flint splendid Brussels; tin
so rich and so cheap?only seventy-five tra
dollars." otl
Now the odious "wiltoty' had been sc. *n
lected by Charles' mother and presented ori
lo them, and the color deepened on his |r^
cheek, as his animated bride continued, ,1C
' suppose we walk down to Brent's and Pe
look at it?there are only two. and it seems cu
i pity not to secure it." "Emma," said je<
Charles gravely, "you arc mistaken if you .
suppose my business will justify extrava- P1'
ganco. It will lx4 useless lo ioox at u?j i
carpet, as we have one which will answer
very well, and is perfectly new." Emma's jV
vivacity fled, and she sat awkardly pick- ,
ing her nails. Charles feit embarrassed? ;vi
he drew out his watch and put it back,? ('J
whistled, and finding a periodical on Em- j!?
ma's tab!", began to read aloud some beautiful
verses. His voice was well toned, and '?)1
he soon entered itro the spirit of the writer !
and forgot his embarrassment when looking w'
into Emma's eyes how he was surprised lv*
instead of the glow of sympathetic feeling or
he expected to meet, to see her head bent a!1
on her hand,?evident displeasure on her '
brow, and a tear slowly trickling down her
cheeks. Charles was a sensible voung

man?I wish there was more of them? .
and he reflected a minu e before lie said, 111
"Emma, my love, get your bonnet and nr;
rloak on, and walk with me, if you please," r"
Emma looked as if she would like to pout
a little longer, but Charles said "come," )r
with such a serious gravely oil his counicnnnce,
that Emma thought proper to ac- aJ,
cede, and nothing doub'ing but that it was ?J,
fo purchase the carpet, took his arm with J
a smile of triumph. They crossed severnl
squares in the direc iou oS Brent's, until n?'
they at last stood before the door of a Cl!
lYiicprnhlo tenement in a back s'reer.? | |.
uYVhere in the world are you taking me," n!'
inquired Emma, shrinking back. Charles J"11
quietly led Iter forward, and lifting the latch, e
they stood in a little room, around the grate ?
of which, three small children were hover- 10
ing closer and closer, as the cold wind
crept through the crevices in the decayed a 1
wails. An emaciated being, whoso shrunk C3
features, sparkling eye, and flushed cheeks m<
spoke of deadly consumption, lay on a ex
wretched low bed. the slight covering ot u.n
which barely sufficed to keep her from J31'
freezing, while a spectral babe, whose black
eyes looked unnaturrlly large from its ex- ;1P
tremc thinness, was vainly endeavoring
to draw sustenance from its dying mother. co
"Flow arc you, Mrs. Wright?" quietly *?
inquired Charles. The woman feebly rais- an

promised her to look after you in her ab- ^1
sence, only informed mo to-day of your ill- se
nr-ss." "F have been very ill," she faintly e(*
replied, sinking back on her straw bed.
Emma drew near, she arranged the pillow of
and bed cloths over the feeble sufferer, but Tl
her heart was too full to speak?Charles ob- the
served it and felt satisfied. "Is that beau- th(
tiful girl your bride? I beared you were lot
married?" "Yes, and in my mother's ab- th(
sonce she will see you do not suffer." wi
Bless you Mr. Charles West?bless you pit

ing a good deal for her. You are very fot

Emma, "and you are just married." Charles la?
saw Emma could not speak, and lie hurried sa
her home promising to send the poor woman in
coal that night. The moment they reached
home, Emma burs' into tears. "My dear thi

It is unnecessary 'o say that the ''odious
Iton," kept its place, but the shivering
ildren of want, were taught to bless the
me of Emma West, and it formed the
;t articulate murmur on the lips of the
iug sufferer.

SujTice it to say, that he lived in the

it one opinion in all classes of the com.
unity, that a fairer and more estimable

hibifed a sound mind in a sound body,
til his last sickness in 1S36, aged ninetyjht.
He read much and had a happy talt

the sloop Four Brothers remains untold,
lere was a spirit in the firm, which, with
fir rising prospects, would not permit
?m to "live lor themselves." A College
Rhode Island Colony was suggested in
fir hearings. They consulted and acted
th sever 1 other honorable n e |of the
ice, and by their influence and largeness
subscription, Providence College, now
} honorable University of Brown, was
jnded, 170. The Browns, including the
riily of Judge Jenks, with which Nieho.
! was connected in his first marriage, are
id to have excelled the other subscribers
amount of subscription.
The last of the four brothers is gone, and
nonly one male member of the four faniis
survives, at the age of 68.
But the spirit of the father lives with his
representative son. After closing a colle*
giatc course, he succeeded to the busim ss
of bis father. His own gains an J his portion
of the paternal liberal estate were early and
nobly dev oted by him to the doing of good
and have spread over each hemisphere.?
Science, religionand humanity have rt-ceived
largeiy at his hand. It is calculated that
88,000 or upwards, have been devoted by
him for the benefit of his Alma Mater. One
collegiate edifice has been reared by him,
to which he has given the name of his only
and beloved sister, Hope, the relic of the
late Thos. P. Ives; Mope Hall. Another
edifice has since been reared which lie has
honored by bestowing upon it the name of
the President of his own college period,
Mini-iinnr Hnll. flanoilv for Mr. Nicholas
O ~rr v Brown,
the second, Thomas P. Ives, after
a thorough mercantile education under Nicholas
Brown, scinor, and after marriage
with his only daughter, became early associated
with him ; and a house was formed
under the well known and long respected
names of Brown & Ives. xMr. Ives' tul.
ents, address and character, were of the
first class. Increasing success attended
the new house; and ample and honorable
were their gains. An active charity was
closely associated with the profits of the joint
concern, in liberal proportion, as God prospered
them. It is concluded that in the
course of forty years of business, a thousand
souls or more were maintained annually in
their employ. In one distinguished instance
and at a threatening period, something re.
scmbling the present Mr. Ives suggested
loan of five hundred thousrnd dollars to the
reliefof the father and leader of the American
Cotton and Cloth Mills S. Slater, Esq.
now deceased, when-otherwise a complete
bankrup'cy must have taken place. To
this proposal ihe senior of the firm gave
( his instant and most cordial assent. Slater

' H UO OUf WM " 1 w.w ?, ?w
is believed, is without a parrallel in our
mercantile houses. Slater, in consequence
is said at his death to leave half a million
to his heirs.
The charities of the firm, and of the
members in their private capacity, are
known to have been of immense amount,
besides hundreds and thousands known
only between the parties favoring and favored.
The property, which hts been acquired
and possessed, among the four brothers,
owners of the original sloop concern, including
the 1+mscs of the sons of Nicholas
and Moses, has probably, (such is the bei
lief. \ in the course of 70 vears. amounted
?'/ * .
to four millions of dollars. One million or
a million and a half of dollars are suppoj
scd to have been generously given by the
i brothers, and t heir sons or sons in law, in
, aid or science, religion, TTCTrriaTlTTy and
friendship. This remark embraces the
I numerous instances in which monies
' and property to the value of hundreds
of thousands have been dealt out in cases
of known hazard, to preserve families from
1 perplexity and ruin.
i The bland and just Mr. Ives is gone
too ;?but the two families of Brown and
! Ives arestjil pu rsuing the same noble and
generous course. Very lately the Providence pers
announce their joint con'ribu ion of
< sixteen thousand dollars for the foun '.ngof a
j literary Athcnamm for the city of Provi!
dencc. May a property, in which so
! many have shared, be s'ill preserved to the
j Browns and Iveses. From them, if th s
' prosperity continue and times fuvor, still
more of good designs will be formed and
carried into successful operation. May
God excite others to imbibe their spirit, and
I tn around them in their abundance to
see how best they may prove themselves
