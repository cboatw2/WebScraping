From the Dublin University Magazine.
MEMORY.
When backward, through depaarted years
On memory's wing we stray,
How oft we find but founts of tears ' *
Along the wasted way!
The heart will vainly seek the light
That rested there before,
And sadly turn to mourn the blight
Of all it loved of yore!
We watch for footsteps that have come
To breathe the twilight vow,
We listen?for the silver tone
Of voices?silent novo!
We gaze on old familiar things,
And marvel that they bear
No gladness to our spirit's wings
Like what of old was there!
Even thus, when through departed years,
On memory's we stray, ^ ? *'
We find alas! but founts of tears?
Along the wasted way.

SAVE YOUR ASHES.
Take leeched ashes and drop a handful .
' - j? __i '
on the com when planting; ary usucs is
better but after soap is made the contents
of the ley-hopper should be saved for corn
planting. A bushel of dry ashes should be
sowed on an acre of wheat two or three
times iu the Spring, either in heavy dews
or misting rain. I
The manure of ashes or lime used as a ,
top dresser, is not near all the benefit;
there are several kinds of insects materially
interrupted in their ravages on the
green growing grain. If you have not a
roof and floor for keeping ashes?please (
to make them, and preserve all dry that ,
does not get used freely.

TIME AND EARLY RISING. j
Reader! if you have to be one and twen- \
ty withont having learned that time is money?more
emphatically money than dollars
and cents you had better begin in ,
your A B C again. If you have made your j
fortune beware of robbing your friends of
their time whose fortunes are yet to be acheived
by industry. Never enter a merchants
store, a mechanics shop, or a law .
yers office, for the purpose of mere conver
sation; if you have business with either, ,
despatch it as soon as you can. Take it ,
forgranted, that every man ofsense knows |
the present value of minutes, and endeav ,
ors io let no particle of time tall useless to (
the ground. (
Industry, perseverance, punctuality and
integrity are all greatly advanced by early .
rising. A youth may learn many sciences <
and languages merely by making proper ,
use of the early hours of daylight in the j
Summer season. Early rising is perhaps (
by some considered a vulgar habit? ,
therefore, it it a thing well enongh for me- ]
chanics and laborers, but by no means.to {
be adopted by the higher classes of socie- ,
ty. But those who think so, either know J
nothing of the biographies of eminent men j
or have perused them, with tittle attention. 4
r. X * : '
It is indsiputable that few men ever lived
to a great age and fewer still ever became
distinguished for their abilities who were
not in the habit of early rising. If
you rise late of course you cannot get
about your business till a late hour,
and then everything goes wrong through
out the day. Dr. Franklin says "that he
who rises late may trot all day and will
not overtake his business, at night," indeed
it may be 'confidently affirmed, that he
who is in the habit of early rising in his
youth, will be much more likely to live to
an old age, more likely to be a distinguish
ed and useful man in society, and more
likely to pass a pleasant and peaceful life,
than he who makes a practice of lying in
bed tilha late hour in the day as many do.

fg^necdote'?King James I, of England
went out of his way to hear u noted prea
cher. The clergyman seeing the King
enter, left his text to declaim against
swearing, for which the King was notori
ous. when done, James thanked him for
for his sermon, but asked what connexion
swearing had with the text. He answer
ed since 'Since your Majesty came out of
your way through curiosity to meet me.

out of mine to meet you.'
We copy the following from one of our !
exchange papers:
Marriage.?With all its ills and evils, J
man knows no happiness until he marries;
let hirn possess a woman of sense!
and virtue, and of whom he himself is
i i :ii r...i 1m :
wormy, ana ne win icei a ?unu auu :
manentjoy, of which he never was before
sensible. For as somebody says,
the happiness of marriage, like the interest
of money, arises from a regular and
established fund; while unmarried libertines
live upon the principal and become
bankrupt in character and respectability.
To be sure, (as the same authority tells
js,) uninterrupted happiness no men can
?r ought to expect. Life is no sinecure;'
Fruits do not spring spontaneously from
the earth, as they did in the garden of i
Eden, nor does manna drop from the
clouds as it did in the Wilderness. But |
is a scheme of solid comfort, matrimony
iffords to well regulated minds a double
share of pleasure in prosperity, and a
solace in sorrow and adversity.
Her Contra.?The following is frpm
Blackwood's Magazine, written probably
jy some disappointed swain:
Marriage.?Look at the great mass of J
carriages that take place over the whole
world; what poor contemptible affairs j
:hey are! A few soft looks, a walk, a
squeeze of the hand, a popping of the
question, a purchasing of a certain num-1
oer of yards of white satin, a ring, a cler- !
jyman, a stage, or two in a hired carriage,
a night in a country inn, and the '
whole matter is over. For five or six!
weeks two sheepish looking persons are \
seen dangling on each other's arm, looking
at waterfalls, or making morning calls,

thing falls into the most monotonous routine;
the wife sits on one side of the hearth, \
the husband on the other, and little quarrels,
little pleasures, little cares, and little
children, gradually gather around
them. This is what ninety-nine out of a
hundred find to be the delights of matrimony.
From the Temperance Advocate.
Young >Semmes, who shot Professor
Davis last* winter, is said to be rapidly
sinking under consumption. He was arraigned
for trial, but the case was defferred,
on account of his illness. It is
thought that he will never be brought to
trial before a human tribunal. But he
has doubtless suffered, already, far more,
of mental torture than the sentence of
any earthly tribunal could inflict, and
whatevei may be the issue of his trial,
or his sickness, his example will stand
forth as a melancholy, but fearful memento
to the young, of the danger of carrying
about their persons deadly weapons,
whether for the purpose of defence, or
agression.
Having alluded to this subject, we cannot
forbear giving an eloquent and appropriate
extract in point, from an Address
- ?* -t _1
by Dr. Dickson of Charleston, to me graduating
class of the Medical College in that
city, of which he is one of the brightest
crnaments.
"Your professional standing in society,
is well as your superior education, will
;ntitle you to give tone to the habits and
nanners of the circles to which you are

ningled with a dignified self-respect?
Fail not to denounce with all earnestness
ind on every proper occasion, the donestic
and social use of the poison of. the

rous customs which in these evil times
have been gaining ground so rapidly in
the Southern and Western sections of
this fair land. Leave to the Italian his
stiletto?to the Spaniard his blood-stained
knife, and to the red savage his tomahawk;
but disdain even to seek protection
against a ruffian by imitating him in the
accursed practice of wearing concealed
arms under whatever name and of whatever
fabric. Die rather! and thus arouse
the majesty of public opinion to aid a feeble
legislation in avenging murder and according
effectual security. * .
GOD SEEN IN ALL HIS WORKS.
A TALE FROM THE GERMAN.
In that beautiful part of Germany
* ? -1 riL!- it 1
whicb borders on me itmne, mere i? a
noble castle, which, as you travel on the
western banks of the river, Gou may see
liftjqg its ancient towers on the opposite
side, above the grove of trees about as
old as itself. About forty years ago there
j lived at that castle a noble gentleman,
I whom we shall call Baron . That
| Baron had only one son, who was not
, only a 'comfort to his father, but a blessing
to all who lived on his father's farm.
It happened on a certain occasion, that
this young man being from home, there
came a French gentleman to see the Baron.
As soon as this gentleman came into
the castle he began to talk of his Hea.
i _ij
venly ratner in lermsmai cninea me uiu
man's blood; on which the old man reproved
him, saying, "are you not afraid
of offending God who reigns above, by
speaking in such a manner?" The gentleman
said he knew nothirg about God, for
he never s&w him. The Baron did not
notice at this time what the gentleman
said, but in the morning took him about the
castle and grounds, and took occasion
first to show him a very beautiful picture
that hung on the wall. The gentleman
admired the picture very much; and said,
"whoever drew this picture, knows very
well how to use his pencil."
"My son drew this picture," said the
Baron.
"Then your son is a very clever man,"
replied the gentleman.
The Baron then went with his visitor
into the garden, and showed him many
beautiful flowers and forest trees.
"Who has the ordering of this garden?"
asked the gentleman.
"My son," replied the Baron, "he knows
every plant, I may say, from the cedar
of Lebannon, to the hyssop on the wall."
"Indeed," said the gentleman, "I shall
think very highly of him soon."
The Baron then took him into the vil
it A 41
lage and showed mm a sman neaicouage,
where his son had established a school,
and where he caused all young children
who had lost their parents to be received
and nourished at his own expense. The
children in the house looked so innocent
and happy, that the gentleman was very
much pleased, and when he returned to
the castle, he said to the Baron, "what a
happy man you arc to have so good a son."
"How do you know I have so good a
son?"
"Because I have seen his works, and I
know he must be good and clever if he
has done all you have shown me."
i'But you have never seen him."
"No, but I know him very well because
1 judge of him bv his works."
"True," replied the Baron, "and in this
way I judge of the character of our Heavenly
Father. I know from his works
, that he is a being of infinite wisdom, and
power and goodness."
' The Frenchman felt the force of the
reproof, and was careful not to offend the
good Baron any more uy ma jcihojuo.
THE CASE OF THE CAROLINE.
So far as McLeod only is concerned,
! the difference with England is unimporI
tant and easily disposad of. Though England
has acted on a different principle,
for in fact, she has never regarded any
principle of international law, her whole
history shews, McLeod, we concede, is
i entitled to an acquital.on his Government
assuming the responsibility of his act?
and we approve of this having been conceeded
by Mr. Webster.
But then was the attack on the Caroline
justifiable? It has always been our
opinion that it was justifiable?and if so
held by our Government, they should
say so at once; and the whole matter is
ended; but it the uovernmeni involves
the national honor by insisting that the attack
was unjustifiable and a gross outrage
?it is bound to insist on atonement in the <
most peremptory terms, and this Mr. '

NEW MEXICAN TftADE.
While our country is in some sort
in a state of torpidity, slumbering and
gasping from past errors, there js no entcrprize
that more favorably presenter .
field for both capita) and industry, than a
trade with some of the principal towns of
Mexico.
So little are the Mexican people vereetf . ^
in commercial arts, that native enterprize s ||
is entirely inadequate to supply the wants . . 3
of the populous interior; while the unset- *
tied political state of the country Has in
great degree excluded the competition o?Jfii* *
foreign capital, and skill. The field-is ? v'
nearly a new one; the difficulties are 'considerable,
and the harvest will be a large
one, and valuable in production. The .
success will be according to the juidicious
selection of the plan, ana the energy of /
its execution.
It is proposed that this Company will
commence upon a capital, stock of $ 100,000
to consist of one hundred shares, of
81000 each; to be increased, at the discretion
of the Company, to $500,000.?
Its purpose is to conduct our inland trade
into the heart of the Mexjcan territory;
and the proposed route is, by water, up
Red River to Fort Towson, and thence,' ,
by land, over a high and dry prairie, to
Chichuhua, and other towns adjacent.?
The proposed route is 200 miles shorter
than any other, by land.
This coarse- is-recom memfctfTSy Efjudi- . *
cious comparison of the facilities of fwwel,
with the prospects of compensation. The
territory designated, is not only the most*
easy of access, and hitherto, little frequent- : .
cd, but also the richest in the precious r- "->
metals which constitute the prihcipal rie- .
turn of the Mexican trader. It inchides
the most productive of the silver mines of
America. The Governor of Chihuahua
is a great friend to this trade, and gave an
escort of cavalry to M. De Valois. ;
Since everything must depend, on*thie ;v".'v - '
energy and discretion with wnicb the plan
shall be carried out, the expeditions/of
the Company will.be coiwlucted in. person; '
by a gentleman eminently qualified, by
experience and skill, to give confidence,
and ensure ample success. '
As this attempt to open a new branch
of American commerce, has (not undeservedly,)
been considered a matter of
some public interest, assurances are had
that an escort of one Company of United
States mounted troops wijl be furnished
by the Federal Government, free of ex&
pense, to the Company. And it is ttlsor*
confidently anticipated, that the draw^:
back now allowed on imported goods re-;,
exported coastwise, will be extended by
Congress to the similar exports (by land),
of this Company..
Every precautionary means will be adopted
to prevent and remove any jealousy*,
on the part of the Mexican authorities, in. ^ ^
regard to the purposes of the Company;
and its operations will be scroupuloqjMy;vconfincd
to objects strictly and simply ^
commercial. It will be attempted, also,'
to create a domestic interest in favor of
the enterprize, by a judicious admission
of native capital, to a participation of its
profits and management.
The trip_can be accomplished in fivo
months. The distance oy iana is aoout
600 miles. The goods to be transported
in wagons, or on packs. - The grass in the
prairies affords abundance of subsistance
for the mules or oxen, while the herds of
buffalo or deer would ensure provisions
for thecommandj yet prudence will require
that some flour or hard bread be provick
?d. .
The route is through predatoiybands
jf Cutnanche and Pawnee Indians^ b&t a
company of from 80 to 100 persons will .
)e amply secure from molestation.
.It is Imowr^that Mexico abounds in the
rietals. One mine alone, m the interior,
iear where it is proposed to cbriduetthis
rade, employs at presentfifteen thousand
