in the name or to the profit of the Govern*
ment, the local authorities or of any private
establishment whatsoever, other than
such as are required to meet the expenses
of the necessary precautionary, measures
against smuggling, which precautionary
measures to be observed in regard to transit
to the frontier shall be the same whether
the said articles of commerce are imported
by the vessels of the one or of the
other of the high contracting perties. But
if peculiar circumstances or considerations
should render the re-establishmentof transit
duties necessary on the said articles of!
commerce directed to any one point of the

the Government of tile United States such

of their nation, or subjects or citizens

merciul transactions. *

adoptee! : . ...
"Resolved, That a Committee of three
be appointed to address a letter to the .
Hot). John (Campbell and request him to
give his views on the approebhing Presidential
election, and inxase the. election
should come into the-ffo^se ofRepresen- .
tatives, what course be would pursue."
The Committee of which Cot W. W.
Harllee was Chairman immediately ertter*
etfinto a correspondence with Mf. Ctrrop*
bell, who, in reply has written -a lono?a
vpfyjon^ffitter^defrmng his pro position.
The resultrwe are fortnnately able to lay
before ihe public in a narrow compass and
iu the Very words of the correspondence;
The Committee propounded to Mr. Campbell
the two following questions : ' ' "'
** 1st. Are you In fifvor of a re-Hectiott
of Mr. Van Buren as President of theiJniled
States?
. "2nd. In case the election for Presidenl
should come in'to the House of Represent
totive6, which of the two Candidates would
you vote for ?"
| - To* these questions'Mr. Campbellhaav
[ given iu the conclusion. of his letter the
following unequivocal answers.
u Tu the first of the questions,! answer;
tha't however much I may object to Certain .
incidents in Mr. Van Durcn's political life,
or dissent from particular measured of his
Administration'^ I am under existing circumstances,,
in favor of liia re-election ;
because his toiirso upon the whole sinco
he has been President of the United States,'
has been such in my estiraationy as to en
title him la the confidtnro of'the-South ;
and because 1 prefer the principles of the
the party ia the non-slave holding states
by which he is supported, and Whose ascendancy
I believe .to be in a great roea-1
sure identified wirh his re-election, to those
of the party in the same states by whichhe
is opposed.
" To your second interrogatory the an- "
swer i3 already made, so far as nty personal
preferences are concerned^ bnt should. *

contemplates, 1 will endeavor tp car- -

The Thompson and Preston Dinner
came off ,at this place on ' Saturday Jaat.
Great preparations had been made, and a
great flourish of trumpets, to gather in the
people to be converted to Hirrisunism;
and it was even reported, in one part of
the Diftrict, that a free discussion was to
take plore, we presume for the purpose
of inducing a turn out; which report; like
most of the Wfcig reports, proved to be a
great mistake. But one side was heard,
and but- one strain harped upon by the
orators?strong abuse of* Van Bureq, end '
strong praise of Harrison.

been magnified by. the getters' opt^flhe )
same, to 2000 or 2500! Butonexciled men,
of .both parties, place the number, inclu-?
ding men, - women ami buys, at about
1000 or 120U persons, and this estimate
wc think.uie most correct. ine precise
number of these who fell into ranks in the
procession wits 168!!!!! A xiecitifed portion
of the crowd at the stand was composed
of strangers to the District?but a few
hundred of the District attended. Then
were siso a very considerable number of s.auuch
Van Buren men present, who, after
hearing the general abuse of the Administration
by both orators, left the
ground more confirmed thaii ever in support
of* their cause, as they had heard no
solid argument against it. The orators
seemed' to forget, that to abuse men aiwl
nidi jiiuiuiwilli viuicm ouu juivuijic*
rale language, was nol the way to win
ihcm over lo their side. ..
We have not space at present to review
he-speeches; and this is the less itnpor;ant,
as the people of the District will hare
in opportunity to hear the charges and
nisstuiements of the orators answered and
efuted on Moiylay next. Gen. Tllomptou
commenced with a complaint that
here had been efforts ' to keep away the
people." We believe he had no just
grounds for saying so; on the contrary,
lie efforts of his particular ffiends were
;reat. to procure a turn out. AVe know
10 obstacle being thrown in the way; and
f the merited unpopularity of Gen.
rhompson's Harrison cause in this Hie*
rict prevented the people from giving
heir countenance to the dinner, it is his viwii
fault, or misfortune, for connecting
limself with the Northern Whig party.
Ie need not calculate,' because he hat
cen'clected to Congress, that the people
?n ttiorpi',irp hnnnil to rnn after him in
lie support of such a candidate as General
larrison. - If Gen. Thompson had conneced
himself with the great Federal party of
he North, it is no reason that the free, inepetrJent
and Republican citizens of
Greenville should do the same.
The whole speech of Gen. Thompson
?as the usual Whig abuse, and nine-tentha
f it upon matters which have been ?>rer
nd over again answered and explained.
