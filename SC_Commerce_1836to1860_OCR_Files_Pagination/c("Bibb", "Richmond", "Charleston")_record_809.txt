Huai conference, and there oame up the application
of a young man for location on the ground that he
could not stand the itinerant work; and that fre
■ quently after preaching, he was prostrate for sev
eral- days. Upon inquiry, it was stated that the
i reason of this was, the great length of his sermons,
for he was physically, among the strongest men
• belonging to the conference; but he would preach
from three to four hours at a time, tasking time and
strength in one sermon, sufficient in ordinary cases,
to preach a week on his.circuit. This was equal
to from six to'eight sermons a day, of the length
Mr. Wesley usually preached, (a half-hour) or
from forty to fifty sermons a week. This his phy
sical system was not capable of standing, and there
" foreit was, quit or die. S° the young man must
study and practice medicine. Again, long sermons
kill the animation and life of the preacher. We
have not known many who preached habitually
long, who did not become dull and dry, slow and
inanimate, and in common have but little fire and
zeal about them. The Spirit• takes the nigh way
to men's hearts. Moreover long sermons kill
’ themselves ; we have often witnessed the suicidal
effects of sermons on themselves, having to die un
der the burden of their own length. We once at
tended an annual conference ; the presiding Bishop
was a map of acknowledged ability, and of great
popularity as a preacher. He preached on Sab
bath morning to a large concourse of people an
able and interesting sermon, but unfortunately for
the sermon it was long far beyond what we under
stood w&8 the custom of the Bishop to preach.
And to add to the misfortune it was on the period of
'■ the ordination of some young men who had pro
mised in their ordination vows not to preach too
long. From the commencement, the sermon had
a happy effect for about one hour, (perhaps about
' half its length) and after that time it began to lose
its effect and power, till at the cloee, it was mani
fest that life was extinct. We heard some say
afterwards—what a pity the Bishop had not stopped
at the close of his first hour; others, that it was an
able effort, but was killed by the length of it. We
think it a pity that such sermons should die under
their own weight But they never fail to kill.
Death is in them. “And he was taken up dead."
Long sermons kill revivals. It iB our belief from
what we have witnessed of the effects of long ser
mons on revivals, that three sermons a day of two
hours length, for even two days together, would
fix a grave for any revival we have ever known
We have seen revivals paralyzed by even one at
an important time. This is the reason why those
preachers who preach two-hour sermons never
have revivals : their sermons would cripple a revi
val even if commenced ; and those who follow this
, practice have time for nothing else and do nothing
else. We once saw a congregation greatly offend
ed by a long sermon, one short summer’s night in
time of a great revival. It depressed (though an
able sermon) the feelings of all; and as we re
turned, one said “ well, that is murder”—another,
I wish he had not come here,”—a third “ well, I
hope they will not put him up any more unless
they want the revival killed.” Long sermons kill
the patience and forbearance of congregations and
greatly embarrass managers of meetings. At
many of our camp-meetings, our presiding elders
are often requested not to put some men up for the
pesple will not bear their long preaching. The
complaint is, that they will kill every thing, they
preach so long; and a man when he has a two or
three-hour sermon in him feels much like preach
ing and little like doing any thing else. So the
people must be offended, and the meeting injured,
or these preachers must be offended. Now we had
about as soon" be some body else as a presiding el
der at a camp-meeting with two or three of these
revival-killers on his hands. We have seen such
men leave about the second or third day of a
meeting, greatly offended at the manager ^of*the
meeting for neglecting them when the petition of
the people has been “ dam put them up, it will be
death.” “ He fell down from the third loft and was
taken up dead,” because Paul preached too long, &c.
We will now improve the subject by noticing 1,
the cause of the habit; 2, some of the evidences
of our preaching too long; and 3, the mode of
correcting it. There are others, but the greatest
cause is example; not from the Bible, except the
text be taken for it; nor is it from prudence, for
that forbids us to do it; nor can the spirit of grace
be charged with it, for preaching long sermons is
an error, and the Spirit guides into all truth ; nor
can it be said to be the fruitfulness of mind or
matter, for who was more highly gifted in this than
Mr. Wesley, and yet he preached but seldom more
than thirty minutes. The young take it from the
old, they preach two and three hours at a time,
and their sermons are called great, and the ideas
of longness and greatness are hitched together, so
that if a man would be as great as Paul, he must
preach till midnight; and thus, a young preacher
imagines he can never be equal to the old ones,
unless he can preach as long. We have heard
them speak of preaching two and three hours on
certain occasions, giving us to understand that it
could have been no small affair, as a sermon, from
that very tact. There are preachers whose exor
diums regularly stretch out to the wearisome length
of twenty minutes; and then it uniformly happens
that the congregation are asleep, just about the
time the preacher has reached his first division.—
O labour thrown unmercifully away. Would it
not be well for such brothren to try the experiment
of beginning without any introduction at all ?—
Take hold of the first strong point of the subject,
without going about it, and about it, and about it,
preparing, to get ready, to—begin!
2. Some of the signs that they are too long; for
for they always follow wherever we cut our ser
mons out too long to fit public opinion. They are
then like garments without any bodies to put them
on ; we had as well not preach at all. Whenever
the people go to sleep, it is time to quit, the sermon
•is too long. This was the premonition of death
in the text When people begin to leave for din
ner, or when we hear the bells ringing, it is time
to leave off; the sermon is too long. There are
others .that might be mentioned, but we must be
brief, or we shall make our own preachment toe
long.
3. The remedy; for something must be done—
And to begin right, the old must reform. Can they
be excused before God and the church, who are tc
be examples for the young in giving them a pat
tern to cut out sermons by, so long, that none will
receive them? We think not. Again, the preach
ers themselves must and can reform. Let them
time themselves ; study condensation. Let them,
if they must have an introduction, never allow it
to exceed five minutes. Longer is never needful
nor is it acceptable. Once more, let it be a point
of examination in the annual conferences, and i
condition in passing character ; whatever renders
a preacher unacceptable to the people, is good
ground for complaint, and for discontinuance 01
location. In all the quarterly conferences make it
an objection to the renewal of license or passage
of character, for a man to preach too long. Esta
bligh soma conventional rule that shall determine
what length would be a proper standard, and check
all who go beyond it. Our own opinion is, that on
no occasion a sermon should be longer than one
hour, and- ordinarily, not more than three quarters;
We how close, hoping that the Work of death will
be stopped. “ Thou shalt mot mix.”

WARRENTON CIRCUIT, GEO. CONF.
Dear Brother Wightman,—Having read with
great pleasure, in some of the late numbers of the
Southern Advocate, accounts of several revivals of
religion, I have ventured to draw up a sketch Of a
very gracious work, which has been going on
among us for some months past.
The means made use of were simply a vigorous
bbt calm enforcement of discipline, and plain
preaching j the effects of which were an increased
attention to duty, the awakening and conversion of
souls. Warrenton, New Prospect, Fountain, and
McNears, have been visited largely and gloriously;
at some of the other appointments we have had a
partial work, whilst a few remain cold and fruitless.
The results are indeed gratifying ;—lukewarm
churches revived, the conversion and addition to
the church of 390 members, among whom are
some of the most prominent and respectable in the
county. Several have joined us who were mem
bers of the Baptist Church, against whom a hue
and cry has been raised, committees appointed to
wait upon them, and fearful threats of expulsion
held out, to intimidate and induce “the strayed
ones” to return.
I think this circuit forms an (honourable) ex
ception to brother Evans’s remark, “That the
Baptist brethren have gathered much of the har
vest;” we have gathered our own harvest, and I
trust by God’s grace have secured it;—the’sheep
and lambs are in the folds. O God be thou their
shepherd. Our finances will be much improved;
the collections for religious purposes are larger
than usual; our list of subscribers to the Advocate
and Quarterly Review is respectable: surely we
have reason to “thank God, and take courage.”
Yours in Christ,
Arthub Irwin Lett.

GENERAL INTELLIGENCE.
FOREIGN.
France.—The Monileur contains a Royal ordi
nance, opening in the ministry of Foreign Affairs a
supplementary credit of 200,000/’. for extraordinary
diplomatic missions and unforeseen expenses.
The King has caused to be purchased for his
several private libraries copies of the Marquis de
Custine’s celebrated work “Russia in 1839.”—
“ When the displeasure, amounting to rage, with
which the Emperor Nicholas has received this
book shall be taken into consideration,” says a
Paris letter, “ a more striking or intolerable defi
ance could not have been offered to him by France 1
than is conveyed in the announcement in the Mon
iteur, that King Louis Philippe has ordered for all
his libraries copies of a work which deals so se
verely with Russia, and which the Emperor and
| the whole Russian nation have declared to be false,
from the beginning to the end. This affront will
appear the more obvious and intentional, when it
| shall be borne in mind that the Marquis de Custine,
an avowed Legitimatist, is looked upon as a personal
enemy of the King!”
Le Steele announces the death of M. Dupin, the
elder, at the age of 86 years. His three sons ar
rived too late to receive his last breath.
“ This is the age of inquiry by France,” says a
Paris letter. “ The Commerce states, that M. Le
grand, Under-Secretary of State in the Ministry of
Public Works, has received a most favourable re
port from the engineers sent by the Minister to
Ireland to inspect the atmospheric railway. A
very numerous commission, or set of commissions,
is about to proceed to England on another inquiry,
for which you will, in your present condescending
vein, give all possible facility, This commission
is, or those commissions are, to be composed of
naval officers and others, persons competent to in
quire into and report upon every thing in every
branch of your naval service in every arsenal and
dockyard of Great Britain.”
Since last year fifteen war steamers have been
added to the previous force of this country. The
Labrador (one of those fifteen,) which sailed for
Algiers a few days since, conveyed thither 1,226
soldiers. France will have at sea, in 1844, eight
ships of the line, ten frigates, twelve corvettes,
twenty-six brigs, twenty transport corvettes, forty
flotilla vessels, or transports, and forty-four stea
mers—in all 160; laid up in ordinary, eight ships,
eight frigates, six corvettes, two transport cor
vettes, and six steamers—two of 540-horse power,
two of 450, and two of 220. On the whole, the dif
ference between 1844 and 1843 will be an addition
of thirty ships of war ; of these fifteen are stea
mers, two of which are of 540-horse power.
PEINCE PoLIGNAC AND THE FRENCH GOVERN
MENT.—A Paris letter, received on Thursday, refers
at much length to an event of considerable interest
that had just occurred in the French capital. “You
will recollect,” says the writer, “ that some weeks
since I informed you that Prince Polignac had arri
ved with four of his cildren to spend the winter
here. The day before yesterday M. Benj. Delessert
(Prefect of Police) addressed to the Prince an order
to quit Paris within 48 hours. The Prince expostu
lated, but M. Delessert said that his instructions
were from the highest quarter, and were imperative.
The Prince thereupon applied to Marshal Sebas
tiani, with whom, through the late lamented ladv of
the Marshal, he was connected, and stated to him
the extraordinary intimation he received from the
Prefect of Police. The Marshal instantly proceed
ed to St. Cloud, and in audience of the King reques
ted that the obnoxious order might be withdrawn.
The King positively refused. The Marsha) said,
‘Your Majesty is aware that I would not make a
request, compliance with which would be in the
slightest degree dangerous to your Royal person
“ State. I will be bail for the Prince,’
added he, in conclusion. The King was still
unmoved, but after some time he said, * If the Prince
will write to me'—11 would not allow him to do so,’
said Sebastiani. «Why, Peyronnet wrote to me.’
1 M. Peyronnet is at liberty to do what he pleases,’
said the Marshal ; ‘ but if Prince Polignac follow
his example in that respect, he will cease to be
entitled to my esteem. The Prince has not come
here to conspire ; conspirators do not move about
with a train of four children.’ The only conces
sion he obtained was, however, an extension of the
time to Saturday, when Prince Polignac will quit
Paris, protesting against his forced exile, for inflic
ting which upon him there is, in fact, no legal
ground, the amnesty having been full and plenary
that restored him to civil rights."
Extension of Liverpool.—During the summer
and autumn of the present year, new rows of hou
ses have been begun and carried on for some dis
tance, at four or five different places, between
Edgehill and the Old Swan. They are, none of
them, very choice specimens of architecture,' but I
still each row will serve as a nucleus for fresh ex
ertion, and thus, in ten or twenty years, the town i
of Liverpool will be carried as far as the Old Swan
ridge, just as, during the last generating, it was
carried from the top of Shaw’s-brow and the neigh,
bourhood of St. Peter’s Church, to Edge-hill, to the
Dingle, to Kirkdale, and beyond St. Domingo-house.
Already the gas has been laid down upwards of a
mile beyond the Old Swan, which used, a few years
ago, to be thought a long way in the country, and if
it had not been for the introduction of steam-boats,
which have taken between twenty and thirty thou
sand persons to the opposite side of the river, the
population would by this time have extended in an
unbroken line as far as the gas now extends_Liv
erpool Timet. . \ >it ;t
Naples.—A letter from Naples, in the Prussian
Universal Gazette, says:—“ The Neapolitan Gov
ernment has purchased the island of Lampedusa,
from the Prince of that title, for forty thousand
ducats, with the intention of founding there a col
ony for convicts.”
Rome.—The Semaphore de Marseilles of the 23d
Nov., announces that Nicholas MoUrad, the repre
sentative of the Maronite Patriarch at the Holy
See, the same who was sent on a mission to Paris
in 1833, had been consecrated at Rome Archbishop
of Laodicea.
A Belgian paper of Friday announced the death
of the Pope as having taken place at Rome about
ten days ago ; but in its number of the following
day it says that, though the news of that event had
been received by an eminent banker at Brussels, it
was doubtful if it was correct At Paris it was not
believed.
France and Rome.—A letter from Rome, in the
Cologne Gazette, Bays:—“ The French Ambassador
has opened negotiations with the Papal Government
relative to the part taken by the French bishops on
the education question. It is asserted, that the sa
cred college approves of the conduct of the bishops;
but that the Pope will advise them to moderation,
in consideration of the eminent services rendered
to the Church by the French Government”
Greece.—By the last accounts from Greece,
some reaction had taken place. P. Soutzo, Schina,
Tescharis, and Paico, have been dismissed from
their posts as members of the Council of State.
The Bavarian Court had acknowledged and ac
quiesced in the new Constitutional regime. Rus
sia, on the contrary, withdraws, and pretends to
wash her hands of Greek affairs, only insisting on
four things,—the existence of the monarchy, and
the dynasty; the maintenance of the Greek reli
gion ; and payment of the debt. What fear can
Russia have of the non-maintenance of the Greek
religion 1 If she has, then why insist on the main
tenance of a Catholic dynasty 1 Colocotroni has
been blotted from the list of aides-de-camp to King
Otho, on account of his journey to Munich. Mav
rocordato and Coletti have been appointed Minis
ters, but without special portfolios. Two Chambers
or one, seems the chief dispute amongst the Con
stitutionalists.
The Augsburg Gazette states, from Athens, Nov.
6, that the Austrian Government had recognized the
new state of thingB in Greece.
Turkey—The Moniteur announces, that the
Minister for Foreign Affairs had received from the
French Ambassador at Vienna the following des
patch:—“Vienna. Nov. 21.—M. do Bourqueney
has written to me from Constantinople to announce
that the President of the Council of Justice, Hafiz
Pasha, had been dismissed on the 8th of November,
and replaced by Ahmet Fethi Pasha, brother-in-law
of the Sultan.” This announcement by telegraph
reaches us, however, only with a similar communica
tion by post, and through the Augsburg Gazette.
Ahmet Fethi Pasha, who has been lately appointed
to replace HafizPashaas Presidentof the Council of
Justice, belongs to an honorable family of Rhodes.
He served with distinction in the army, and particu
larly in the campaign of 1828 against the Russians,
in which he gained the title of Fethi (victorious) by
a brilliant deed of arms. It was Ahmet Fethi Pasha
who, by organizing a system of quarantine, extirpa
ted the plague from the Ottoman empire. Ahmet
Fethi Pasha married in the year 1840 the sister of
the reigning Sultan. He is a decided Reformer,
and enjoys a high reputation for probity.
The New Comet.—At one o’clock in the morn
ing of the 22nd ult., a comet, only visible through
a telescope, was discovered near the star Gamma,
of Orion, by M. Faye, an astronomer attached to the
Royal Observatory at Paris. Notwitshtanding the
clouds and vapors which impeded the view and ren
dered the observation uncertain, the position of the
star was ascertained to be as follows :—On the 22nd
of November, 1843, at 14 hours 44 minutes 11 sec
onds medium time of Paris, reckoned from mid-day,
the right ascension of the comet was 81 deg. 5 min.,
and the boreal declension was 6 deg. 56 min. The
sky was so cloudy on the following night, that it
was only on the 24th that the comet was again seen,
when its position was ascertained with complete
precision. On the 24th of November, 1843, at 17 h.
4 min. 43 sec. medium time of Paris, counted from
mid-day, the right ascension of the comet was 80
deg. 50 min. 42 sec. Boreal declension of the comet
6 deg. 30 min. 35 sec. Thus the apparent right ascen
sion of the comet diminished by seven minutes of a
degree within about 24 hours, and in the same inter
val of time, the declension likewise diminished by
twelve minutes. This comet presents a head so
distinct that the observations are singularly facilita
ted. From the head slight trains of light diverge
nearly opposite to the sun. The tail is at present
in length about four minutes of a degree.
Letters from Algiers announce that the Aghaof
Tremeca, who was appointed to that situation by
the French Government, has revolted suddenly, and
retired into the territory of the Emperor of Moroc
cy, after having committed severe! acts of violence,
and pillaging some villages. It was feared that his
example would be followed by the chiefs of other
tribes of the subdued. To this revolt is attributed
a royal ordinance which appeared in the Moniteur
Parisien of Monday, by which the Minister of War
is allowed an extraordinary grant of 990,000f. “ for
urgent and unlooked-for expenses in Algiers.’
The colony of Algieria is admitted to be as far as
ever from a state of peace and tranquillity.
Thames Tunnel-Notwithstanding the bad
weather, about 25,000 persons passed through the
tunnel last week, making the total number over
1,640,000 since it has been opened, day and night
as a regular thoroughfare. ,

The necessity for sudh a work arises out of the
fact that there are hundreds of thousands in our
country who profess to be pursuing the studies of
which we propose to treat, each one of whom needs
advice, direction and assistance in the pursuit of
them. Does he wish to know the difference be
tween the construction of his own language and
that of either of those above-named, he can, it is
true, find many valuable works in the libraries and
at the book-stores, that will aid him in acquiring
this information. He may algo send for the native
teacher, in some instances, and receive instruction
from his lips,—but such assistance is not always
within reach, and in many cases it is entirely inac
cessible. Here then is a necessity,—a pressing
necessity for such a work,—a necessity created by
a large and daily increasing class of persons, and
for which no adequate supply,—no supply whatever
jf the kind that we propose,—has yet been pro
vided. Nearly two years have elapsed since we
conceived theplan, which we now purpose attempt
ing to execute; and though our Journal maybe a
modification of the plan then conceived, yet, sub
stantially, it was partially executed, and announced
in the Southern Quarterly Review for June, 1842.
Circumstances over which we had no control pre
vented its consummation at that period. Whatever
repressions we may then have had of the necessity
For such a work, have been strengthened by the
lapse of time, and we now hope to carry its main
Features into execution.
m. ix umuy oi sucn a worn is as eviuew as its
necessity. Are there hundreds of thousands in
need of an Interpreter giving them the precise
meaning of every foreign word which it uses I Just
such an interpreter this proposes to be. And in
iddition to giving the bad English of good French,
German, &c., it will also give a good English trans
lation of all its examples. This Interpreter the
itudent can always have in his pocket, for a very
:rifling outlay,—furnishing him with useful mat
ter where the living teacher is accessible, and
)f inestimable value to him when he cannot obtain
mch aid,—affording that constant supply demanded
»y every ardent student.
Our plan for conducting the work. The Inter
preter will be printed on a large octavo page, using
the best materials, and executed in good style; each
number to contain 16 pages, in a neat cover, which
may be bound at the end of the year, forming a
large volume of 416 pages. The original, whether
French, Spanish, German or Italian, will always
be translated literally into its corresponding part
of speech in English,—thus clearly exhibiting the
construction of each language. Exercises will
often be given, which can be translated into the
foreign language by all desirous of acquiring the
talent of writing a foreign language ; which exer
cises will always be translated into that language,
thus enabling the student to verify his translation
by the printed one. If there be any truth in the
assertion of the immortal Milton, that we do amiss
to spend seven or eight years merely in scraping
together as much miserable Greek and Latin as
might, with the requisite helps, be learned easily
and delightfully in one year, bow much more are
we to be blamed for spending seven or eight years
n attempting to learn a single modern language,
when three or four may be acquired in half that
time. To furnish the helps requisite for this at
tainment, is, then our object; and, in attempting to
:arry it out, we shall avoid grammatical niceties
:or some time, being fully persuaded that it is far
more beneficial to give a large amount of reading
before troubling the student with grammatical ana
lysis. Still, we feel assured that our system will
[give ample scope to the talents of those who are
grammatically acquainted with their native tongue,
as it will enable such students to parse a for
eign language from the very outset. And though
it is with us a principle to combine with the
maximum of practice the minimum of theory,
in the commencement of linguistic studies ; yet,
when the proper time shall have arrived no
Lhing shall be omitted, which we can be furnished
with by the respective national and other grammat
ical authorities. We are satisfied, that, by pursu
ing this system, the subscriber to the Interpreter,
if he follow its directions, will be able, in the space
if a few months, to write a large amount of all five
languages; and, in a year or two, to translate any
work in either language, not above his capacity,
nto English : speaking them will follow very soon,
if the student.be brought into contact with those
who speak them. He may rest assured he is fully |
nine-tenths of the way to this desirable object,
when he can translate his mother tongue into the
foreign language.
Terms : 93 per annum in advance, either sent
by post or delivered in the city. All post-paid let
ters will be attended to. Address

SEARS’ NEW AND COMPLETE HISTORY
OP THE BIBLE.
In referring to this work it is not necessary that we
enter into long details ; let it suffice that we affirm that
the most learned and enlightened of our countrymen
agree in pronouncing it well worthy ol the patronage of
every Christian, together with all who refer to the Bible
as a Text Book. It is written in a plain and open style,
which can be as easily understood by the ignorant as by
the educated. It has been remarked by many that the
Bible is written in so obscure a style that few can com
prehend it. Here then we have it expounded and Com
mented upon at length, with notes, both critical and ex
planatory, by men who have made it the study of years;
forming of itself a History of near four thousand years.
Two volumes in one, containing near seven hundred large
octavo pages with several hundred engravings, bound in
the most finished style. Price only $3. For sale by
