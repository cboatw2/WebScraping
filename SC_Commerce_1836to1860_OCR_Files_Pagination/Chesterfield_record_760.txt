European Agricultural Tour anj Survey.
We invite attention to the article on i lie first
pago under the above title. Mr. Colman's reports
of his Agricultural Survey of Massachusetts
are among the most valuable papers on the subject
of agriculture ever given to the public in this country.
That his reports from Europe will be of incalculable
value to the country can be doubted by
no one who has read his Massachusetts reports and
who knows any thing of European agriculture.?

the laborers of Europe are all different from ours,

CONGRESS.
In the Senate the Oregon bill finally pasecd
by a small majority. On the third instant,
Mr. Berrien mado a report from the
Judiciaty Committee on the bill of the House,
and a bill of the Senate to repeal the bank,
rupt act. The report recommends that the Senate
l>ill Ix; indefinitely postponed ; and that tlic bill
from the House be so amended ns not to rcpeul
the act, but abolish the provision for voluntary
bankruptcy, and require the consent of a majority
of creditors to force a debtor to bankruptcy. On
the 6th Mr. Archer moved a reconsideration of the
the vote on the Oregon bill. The question of re.
consideration was postj>oncd till the next day. On
tho same day the Senate look up an Exchequer
bill on the table, and Mr. Talluiadgc ma Jo a very
able speech on the subject of the currency.
On the 7th the motion to reconsider the question
on the Oregon bill was taken up und lost, by a ;
vote of 24 to 24; not a majority for it. Had this
question and vote been on the passage of the bill
it would have been lost.
On the seine day Mr. MePufllc submitted res?lutions
in fuvor of adopting measures to revive the
commerce of tho country, iuerc isc its revenue, and i
movent the accumulation of ! ulun for mA>li I

Evans submitted a string of resolutions which lie !
said ho would move as un umendmant to Mr.

principal causes which depressed the commerce of
the country were the want of a good currency, and j

TBMl'BRANCC.
In the large, wealthy, and populous district of
Newberry such has been the influence of the Temperance
Reform upon public opinion, tbut at the
January meeting of tlic Commissioners of Roads,
the time when it was usual for retailers to apply
lor a renewal of their licenses, there was not a
single application. Such a thing lias probably
not occurred in any district in the state before,
since the present license system went fully into
operation.
At Laurens C. II. the last retail shop has recently
been closed; and the Commissioners have determined
to grant no licenses for the district.
Mr. Carey is now in Charleston lecturing on
Temperance.
We see in a Columbia paper an advertisement
offering for sale a quack nostrum on the ruconlmendationoftwo
members ofCongress from South
Carolina." The Hon. S. II. Butler recommends
it as " highly valuable in colds, because" he certifies
" I have experienced relief from it myself, and
I can safely recommend it as possessing great
healing powers." The Itulics are so marked in
the certificate. The Hon. James IIouers adds:
" I have tried the nbovo medicine, und concur entirely
in Mr. Holler's opinion."
Ne so tor ultra crepidam. If members of Congress
would confine the publication of their opinions
and certificates to the subject of national jiolitics
and President-making?the one in which a large
proportion of them seem to feel the deepest interest,
and with which they arc, generally, somewhat acquainted?they
would be less apt to fall into ludicrous
mistakes, than in making publications on
Therapeutics and Materia Mcdica. The only
" healing" power in Therapeutics (known to those
who understand the subject) is the vis medicairix
n'atur.k. Supjiosc this power to be extinguished
in the animal liody to which the " Life Preserver"
of " the two members of Congress from South
Uatolin i" is applied, and what would be the effect
produced by its " great healing powers" ? The
language of the honorable gentlemen is about as
correct an it would be to speak of the propelling
power of the grease and blacklcad applied to a
wagon wheel. All intelligent physiologists know
that in healing processes in the animal economy,
medicines act only by removing obstacles out of
nature's way, or by aiding nature in removing or
overcoming them. The " healing" is done by
nature herself. If the Honorable " members of
Congress" apply to a physician a dozen times, and
he relieves them each turn of their " colds," though
in all the successive instances, a change of symp.
toms requires a change or modification of treat,
meat, they think nothing of it. Treating diseases
is his vocation, lie has studied it, understands it,
and therefore succeeds in it. Hut if they apply to
an ignorant empiric,?or what is more common, if
lie applies to them for permission to cx|>eriinent
upon tlium, and his oxpariuiont fails, nothing is
said about it. llut if Ins nostrum happens to suit
Iho particular variety and stage of 44 cold4' from
which they sutler, they arc in raptures that a fellow
so ignorant should know how to cure a cold,
and they give him an unqualified certificate of
their confidence in him, or rather, in his 44 medicine,"
as a general eold-curer; uud that without
reference to the variety or stage of the cold?to
constitution or age?to climate or season?to the
clTcct upon the secretions, whether cutaneous, renal
or mucous?whatever may be the state of the
body, whether sthenic or asthenic?whether it suffers
from plethora or depletion?whether it needs
bleeding or stimnlantH, starving or stuffing?whatever
may have been the previous stato of health ?
whatever organ may bo utlcctcd, however, and to
whatever extent; let the disease only be called " a
cold," unit whatever the symptoms, this is " the
best medicine." Because the Honorable gentlemen
once " tried" travelling up the river from the
month of Potomac Creek, and thus they reached
Washington City, do they therefore infer that by
travelling up the river from Ceorgetown, Baltimore,
Philadelphia or Columbia, they will also
reach Washington City I No. Why do they
not? Because they understand the subjee.t matter
of consideration, and know better. We repeat
the adage : Ne autor ultra crepidum.
We mean no disrespect to the " two members of
Congress from South Carolina." Nor can the
most fastidious allege that there is any indelicacy
in the introduction of their names into our columns
in connection with this subject. Tliey gave the
certificates (supposing them to l>c genuine) with
their names appended by themselves, evidently for
llie purpose of being made public, and thereby
challenged public scrutiny.
The small pox is now prevailing to more or less
extent in Iloston and New Oilcans, and o.io or
two small towns in Mississippi, it was stated in
the Columbia Chronicle two or throe weeks since,
on the authority of a letter from Charleston, that
it existed also in that city.
We sec advertised in the CJcorgctown Ohservrr,
a negro man committed to the jail of Williams,
luirg " who says his name is Jim, and that lie belongs
to Neal MolJridc of Chesterfield District."
If the law requires nothing to he done to inform
the owners of runaway slaves taken up and committed
to jail, except to advertise in any paper which
the shcritVor jailor may select for that purpose, it
ought to he amended. It is the interest of slicrifis
or jailors to retain slaves as long as they can, he
cause incir sues arcincrcuy increased, it is therefore
their interest to select that paper for advertising
which llie owner of a slave committed will he least
apt to see, or hear of. Not many she-rill's or jailors
would do so; yet the law ought not allow any to
do it.

The following statement appeared in the Charleston
Mercury of the dtli February, and was
overlooked by us at the time or we should llkve

! extensively circulated as possible by the conducI

T1IE SO-CA1.I.EI) MERMAID.
"We have examined the production recently exhibited
at the Masonic Hall purporting to be " the
most wonderful curiosity in the world?the Mcr- ,
! maid." j
This pretended wonder is formed bv the artificial !
union of two very distinct and widely separated
species?an A|?e and a Fish.
The form of the head?the presence of hunds
witli flat nails, and the long canine teeth, prove
that the upper part of this compound In-longs to
the order quadrumana or four handed animals,
which arc composed of many genera and species,
i*; xt are usually called by the general name of
Monkeys- The presence of check (touches, which
in this dried pecin,?n aru thrust upwards on the
cheek bones, unnouncc ii to i.':ivc been an iuliab:tant
of the old world and not of i!:o as no
American Monkey has as yet been discovered
with these appendages. The specimen has been
much distorted and disguised in the preparation;
it appears, however, to be that of an African species,
frequently seen in the managerics of the Unitcd
States.
The lower part is the tail, together with the skin
of the body of a Fish of the order Malacoptcrygii
Abdominalis of Cuvicr, which includes u large
family of fishes whose rays arc all soft, followed
by a second one, small and adipose.
The method which has been adopted to iin(?osc
this gross deception on the public, is the following.
The body of a Monkey, (the hips and lower extremities
having been removed,) is inserted into
the skin of the Fish deprived of its heud?the vertebral
column of the Monkey descending eight or
ten inches into the fish's skin. The termination
of the fish skin upwards can be traced without
much dillieulty round the body, resting on the
skin of the Monkey which passes underneath.
This caricature of nature is rendered more absurd
when we take into consideration that we
have here the whole of the chest of a Monkey and
the skin of the whole chest, abdomen and tail of
a Fish, giving to the animal two chcsU and two
abdomens.
Regarding as we do the exhibition of such a
deformity, uii injury to natural science?as calculated
to perpetuate oil tlie minds of llic ignorant
an absurd fable, and to extort 1110 icy from tlie
public under false pretences, we feel it our duty
to expose this vile deception, and to denounce the
man who exhibits it as an itnposter.

Quere :?Is there no way by wbich impostors

we believe, have a way of bringing suit for the recovery

in this form against the exhibitor, the sum total of

may have so affected a (Government as to

" Mr. t:uv?The citizens of Mobile havenssigned

you on your arrival in Alabama, and
of assuring you of the unfeigned satisfaction your

who disdain, on this occasion, to bo recognised

This, sir, is the s)K>ntaneous homage which an in.

and that you have OXertC"' a marked und de:isive
influence upon those great tuCJUu.41"08 which
lave been proposed s proper to fix and settle th?

that you would escape those angry party

Nor could it be sup|M>scd, that the prcjuliccs

(ccasional, unjust and illiberal criticism. But like
dl had feelings and passions, their duration has
ccn brief. They have vanished before the light

and liberality which the American people
vill always ultimately entertain towards their

congenial to the evening of life, it cannot

whieh your countrymen every where, and of eve y

and to the purity and integiity of your political
life.
44 We of .Mobile, in an especial manner, owe you
a debt of gratitude for your patriotic efforts in inducing

from the imagin ury fears of the colossal power of
the mistress of the seas, you fearlessly and eloquently
maintained our right to the possession of the
country, and demonstrated the policy and propriety
of subjecting it to our laws. Mobile was then
jn obscure village, a mere dcjicndoncy of a Spanish
military post?you now iK'hold it a city of extensive
commerce, and the emporium of one of
die largest staple States in the Union. For this,
tir, and for all the distinguished services you have
rendered this great country, we tender you our
thanks and gratitude, and again I bid you wcl.
come, thrice welcome to the State of Alabama."
We have not space for the eloquent reply of Mr.
Clay.
The two mates of the brig Poultney, of Haiti,
more, attempted uliout the 25lli November, to
murder the captain and take the vessel, which at
Ihc lime was on a voyage to South America. The
[dan serins to have been badly concerted and worso
executed. The Captain was knocked down late
it night, whilst he was passing up the companion
ivny, by one of the mates; the other mate iminrdi.
?'?ly went on deck to prevent the crew from interfering,
by telling t'lein that the captain had a sen tile
with the second mate and would certainly shoot
my of them who might enter the cabin. Some
if them, however, did enter and save the captain's
life, (hie of the mutes is said to be from C'harleson,
ami well educated. These facts are stated
>y the captain of n vessel which arrived in Boston
"rent l'crnuinbuco. The plot seems not to have been
communicated to any of the crew. Those who
would have MeKeii/.ic convicted of murder for
ixccuting Spencer ami others for plotting a siiniar
clime, may derive some comfort from this. If
liraey on bo ird American vessels is what they
wish, it would seem they are likely to be gratified. 1
