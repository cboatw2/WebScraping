Mexico.-The Retail Trade Prohibited
to Foreigners.-We are indebted to Jo
seph Fleming, Esq., a passenger in the
Eurotas, from Havanna, for a manuscript
copy of a decree issued by Santa Ana, at
the Palace of the national government in
Tacubaya, on the 25th uIt., prohibiting to
foreigners not naturalised, all trade by re
tail in the Mexican Republic. The fol
lowing are the principal articles of the de
cree:
Art. 1. All trade by retail in the Mexi
can Republic is prohibited to foreigners,
and they cannot follow it, either publicly
or privately.
Art. 2. from the above prohibition are
excepted foreigners naturalised in the Re
public, those married to Mexican women,
and those who reside in the Republic with
their families.
Art. 3. Foreignners excepted by Art.
2d, and who wish to continue in said
business, must ask permission from the
supreme government, through the Minis
ter of Foreign Affairs, before the expira
tion ofsix months,.and must present the fol
lowing documents. viz: Those who have
obtained a certificate of naturalizations,
and authentic copy of the same: Those
not naturalized, 1. A certificate of the
fact of marrige, duly authenticated by
some one of the Mexican diplomatic or
consular agents abroad, or by the parish
curate of the place in the Republic where
the marraige was comsumttated. 2. A
certificate from the chief political authority
of the place where they reside, declaring
the fact of their residence there, and that
they exercise the conjugal relations. 3. A
certificate from the Legation of their res
pective'countries, that the capital which
the employ, is their own. A want of either
of those proofs is sufficient to exclude
thera from all retail trade.
. 4. Foreigners who may hereafter emi
grate to the Mexican Republic, can en
gage in said business after having cotmpli
ed with the conditions of the foregoing
article.
5. Provides that the names of the per
sons excepted from the operation of this
decree shall be registered at the office of
the Minister of Foreign affairs, together
with a statement of the facts in each case.
6. Six months from the date of the de

wind up their business.
7. Any foreigner not excepted, who af
ter the expiration of the said period shall
epgage or continue in any specie of retail
trade, shall forfeit his goods, andincur a
penalty equal to their value.
8. Foreigners can have workshops in
any part of the Republic, and can sell by
retail the articles of their own manufac
ture, provided they employ any Mexican
apprentices of workmen.
THE UNITED STATES AND'MEXI
CO.
The N. O. Courier of last Friday Eve
ning has the following remarks under this
head.
We announce with regret, that the
eommunications that have passed between
our Minister, Gen. Thompson, and the
M~exican Mittister of Foreign Affairs, ap)
pear to have had a pernicious influence
upon the commercial relations between
the two countries. We publish itn another
chlumn of our paper, a decree which has
been sent to us by the Mexican Consul,
w bich is one of the consequces of these
communications. It is a decree frot: thte
Provisional President of the Mexicatn Re
public, that closes to all foreign commerce,
the custom houses on the fronitiers adjoin
itng the~ territory of the Utnited Statest
that is, the customhnuses at Taos, the
Passo and the Presidio Del. Norte.
Accordingly, the commercial relations
that have existed for sotne years past with
Santa Fc, and which promised such beno
Sicial results, are enttirely suspended.
The diplomatic communications refer
red to above are those relating to the Tex
an ma.rauding parties whic~h were atlledg
ed by the Mexican Government to be com
posed of citizens of-the Unaited States,
to he got up in the United States, and
armed and supported by its people. antd
that titerefore our~ Government was re
sponsible for any mischief tihey had done
or might do. This conclusion wvas per
emptorily rejected by General Thompson,
and the consequence is this sort of imagi
nary blockade of the frontier. It will
not probably prove very efictual. The
following is the diecree.
Art. 1. "Are closed withottt restriction
to all exterior commerce, the frontier cus
somahouses of Taos, in the department of
New Mexico, at the Passe del Norte as
well as the Presidio del Norte, in the de
partment of Chihuahua."
Art. 2. "This declatration shall have
effect iorty five days after its publicarion
in the capital. In consequence, &c.

TaE Revo~toN ots GREECE.
You.will scarcely- be surprised at the
occurrences in Greece, except wvith regard
to the exact limits odemand and coer
cion. of decorum and forbearance, which
the insurgent patriots prescribed.to their
jnst- cause, and strictly observled. From
the extracts of the British correspocdence
at Athens, and the reports of travellers,
which I have occasionly sent to you an
the nature and composition of King Othbo'!
Government and the grievances of his
nativesubjects, you may have expected
an early attempt at revolution. WAhen
the Greeks learned that the recent London
conlerence of the powers that installed the
young' Barvarian over them would not
engage to extort from:himn directly a con
stitution more or less.free they resolved
to manage the ease for; themselves. The
soncert of military had- civil conspirators
was universal, perfect, andlbeautiful. In
the night of the 14th and 15th 'instant, at
2 o'clock A. M. they sallied forth, sur
rounded his magnificent new palace,
roused the absolute monarch, destitute o1
all aid, seat to him the Council of Start
for whom he had asked and with whom
they had arranged the: =form of his prom
ise to convoke a national assembly and
dismiss all the Bavarian functionaries.
Otho yielded at once, and implicitly.
The diplomatic corpse ssayed to obtain
access but were repulsed, with elaborate
politeness, by the masters of ceremonies,
at the head of the troops and the citizens,
until the Council of State bad come forth
with the required concessioons and decres.
Every body was in the secret of the conspi
racy,save the sleeping pair cfsovereigns. A
"movement" in support of the revolution
was executed by agreement at the same
time at Colchis, the capital of-the island
of Negropont, at Corinth, and at Nauplia,
and indeed at all the chief points of the
realm. Complete unanimity was the as
surance of complete success; obviated all
inducement to an effusion of blood any
where. The new Cabinet-accepted
with like promptitude-is admitted on all
hands to consist of estimable trust-worthy
men. but it is singularly cast: two.are of
the Rusian party, two of the British and
two ofthe French; the only member whn
had not been deemed a votary of one n
those foreign rival interests in Canntis.
the fireship hero (brulotier) of the war
with the Turks. Front this distribution
of partisans, it is conjectured that the
three Powers conspired with the people,
having lost hope of the reimbursement of
their loan at any period until the Bavari
an consumers uf the public revenus were
driven away. and the royal spendthrift
subjected to legislative control in the ad.
ministration of the finances. You may
recollect an oflicial note of M. Guizot com
municating his impression that the Greeks
niere not ripe for representative system.
It was affirmed that Russia concurred
with him in this opinion, and the policy
of deferring the grant of a constitution.
The London Morning Chronicle, whose
correspondents et Athens have uniformily
complained of the French, on this score
exults in the revolution as the overthrow
of M. Guiz"t's scheme. It says:
"The French Government is singular
ly unfortunate. Wherever or whenever
it extends its patronage, even with the
best intention, this patronage is sure to
produce an insurrection or disaster. For
the second time the restoration of the
Mderados in Spain by the French Gov
ernment has ;hrown the whole country in
to chaos. It is now some weeks since the
French Government undertook the aff'air
of Greece. King Otho, jealous alike of
Russia and England, trusted his fortunes
io France, and had just appointed Gen.
Colletti, head of the French party, and
breathing nothing but French ideas, chief
)f the Ministry, when a telegraphic des
patch in the Moniteur tells us the result,
in the announcement of an insurrection."
The Paris National, as the Republican
organ, is quite satisfied with the retention
,f a monarch in Greece, and argues from
the arrangement of the cabinet that the
three powers wili manage. by intrigue and
intimidation, -to remain joint masters, and
trample on real Greek interests. What
ever real national independence the Greeks
may enjoy will doubtless; he due to the
good pleasure, or the mutual jealousy and
antagonism of thz Pentarchy who now
compose politigdf and diplomutic Europe.
They will myintaii their annointed on the
hrone, trayh him to behave better, and,
in order to keep him in closer dependence
on themselves, will allow the Greek Na
ional Assembly to hedge the royal prero
~aive in accordance with the theories o1
liberalism. They have little to fear from
tht Assembly, whtich is called for in the
14th proxitmo; the numbers atid the terni
ory of the Greeks are too small for mutcl
weight in the rivalry and calcula'iotns o
the fivejPowers; the kingdomi could estree
l now, single-handed, resist thte Turks.
The getnius and habits of the Greeks are
lemocratic; they wvere left in possessiorl
uf their municipal freedom, their opet
courts of justice on the French model,
and an almost absolute liberty of the
press. They have many citizens with at
education of the best European stamp,
and the considerable advatncement of the
classes of the population in contact witi
the civilized wvorld and its action canno
be denied; yet no small part of the in
habitants of the provinces are semi-barba
rons; and the modern Greek characte
has ttot risen materially in general esti
taion. Fine things have been writter
and spoken about the new kingdom as
bulwark against the ambition of Russia
and as a revival of glorious antiquity.
Trhe more plausible notion is, that it wil
be rendered subservient to that ambhition
through the influences of a comtmon reli
gion and the superior tactics and more
auspicious position of the ever-growing
etpire. As for the generation of a pec
pe-that is. restoration of ancient great
ness; after long and complete decay a
degeneracy, there is no instance of it whici
I can recollect in human annals. In thi
respect, I can cherish no fond hope
Greece, nor of Turkey, nor of any
the peninsulas, A usonian or Iberian. Thb
Italians. the Dutch, and the Belgians mas
be in'itslrious cotmmnunities-productive
and tmore or less free, according to th<
tendencies of the age; but we can expec
from them nothing like the tmoument
and performances of their ancestors of thi
higher centuries. The Germans, British
Freadh, have never declined; they will at
cend' in power and grandeur: the Swis
have not d windled nor spoiled within ma
teially; their,aational importance and mo
menum are, however, gone: internal di
visions weaken and loosen them yearly.
Russia and the United States are in thi
outset of their first career, with splendit
means, vast resources, unprecedented ad
vantages. It might he salutrnry for therr
to conclude, from history, that there is u
redempton for vitiated, unrighteous, all.

From the Charleston Courier.
St:-I have read the communication
in your paper of the 28th, under the sig
nature of "Hold on," in relation to the
shortness of :he present crop, and agree
so fully with him, that I. cannot refrain
from adding my evidence and views in
confirmation of his. It is too true that
the long spell of dry and beautiful weath
er was considered by the planters them
selves as very favorable to their crops.
The cotton they gathered, in consequence
has been very clean and white, but every
one has been disappointed as to its effect
on the late cotton. Having picked all the
cotton that opened during the dry period
before the frost, and expecting that half of
my crop still remained in the fields, I find,
to my astonishment, that it has ceased in
- a great degree to open. Day after day I
overlooked it, but the fields will not be
come white. The same thing occurred to
ime in 183J, then planting in a different
pan of the State. The overseer.- until
frost, said le would make 200 bales.
Thu frost came on several days after the
20th Oct., and I made but 130 bales,
scarcely a holl opened afterwards, though
" the fields were filled with them full grown.
With the present prospect of my crop, I
believe it will be the shortest I have made
for years. I am positively alarmed at ap
pearances, though I have been predicting
a failure fromt the beginning of summer,
but it is a sadder deficit than I had antici
pated; * Not an individual in my neigh
hood but will fall far short of every cal
culation mode ott his crop by himself or
- his neighbors. What cotton is hereafter
gathered cannot be as good as that. here
tofore gathered; but I cannot doubt but
that it will hear as good a .rice. What
in some degree efTects thu market, is the
rapidity with which the Rail Roads hurry
all the early cottur into market. I ques
tion if half (if not more) of the crop with
in reach of this Rail Road has not already
gone to market. Formerly this market
was distributed over the period of six or
seven moths, now it is hemmed into the
space of two or three. This must have
its temporary effect on prices. Such is
the improved conditiun of conveyances
throughout the United States that the crop
is now carried to market in one third of
the time it formerly required. But for
our excessive tariff, I believe no more fa
vorable period has occurred for great im
provement in commerce in every respect,
than that now existing within the reach of
our comnercial intercourse.

Watch-House inhumanity.--We per
ceive that much feeling has been occa
sioned at Boston by the melancholy death
of Lieut. Wyche. Suspicios are inti
mated that his treatment was harsh and
exasperating, and fault is found with the
composition of the corrocer's jury, several
of the jurors being persons conrected with
t the watch department. A fuller investi
gation is called for, before a tribunal that
cannot be suspected of bias.
The event suggests what we have often
suggested, the propriety, the humanity, of
having better provision made at watch
houses and prisions for rendering medical
assistace. Even supposing Lieut. Wychte
to have been merely intoxicated, there
can be no doubt that by the proper aid
arid counsel his lire mighit have been spar
edl. A mutn in his situatiotn should not lhe
left alone in a cell-abandoned to his own
m tiserable reflections-without a cheeritng
Iword or the tone of a kindly voice to pour
consolation upon his~ bruised anad despair
inag soul. But if he was temporally ale
ranged, and not under the infiluence of
liquaer, how barbarous was the treatmet
he received.
We do not blame the watchmen, but
the inhuman system of neglect under
which they acted.-N. Y. Corn. Ada.

-look saucily at him or 'who brushe'
against his aristocratic coat, 'as may he
seen by perusing the antiexed paragraph,

History of Insects." And afterreading
this, may we not. say with Knowles,
"Man, that is above them all, doth ape
them all !"
"On those fir~e spring days in which
the sun is beautiful and warm, duels may
often be seen to take place between two
inhabitants of the same hive. In some
cases, the.quarrel appears to have begun
within, and the combatants may be seen
coming out of the gates eager "for blows."
Sometime a bee peaceably settled on the
outside of the hive, or walking about, is
rudely jostled by another, and then the at
tack commences, each endeavoring obtain
the most advantageous position. They
turn, pirouette, throttle each other; and
such is their bitter earnestness, that Reau
mur has been enabled to come near, to ob.
serve them with a lens wittont causing
a separation. After rolling about in the
dust, the victor. watching the time when
its enemy uncovers his body, by elonga
ting it, in the attempt to sting, thrusts its
weapon between the scales. and the next
instant its antagonist stretches out its
quivering wings. and expires. A bee can
not be killed so suddenly, except by
crushing, as by the stitg of another bee.
Sometimes the stronger insect produces
the death of the vanquished by.sqneeziu
its chest. After this rent has been done.
the victorious bee constantly remains,
says Reaumur, near his victim, standing
oni his four front legs, and rubbing tt'e
two posterior ones together. Sometimes
the enemy is killed in the hive; then the
victor always carries the corpse out of the
city, and leaves it. These combats are
strictly duels, not more than two being
concerned in them; and this is even the
case when armies of bees meet in com
hat.''
Anecdote of a Goose.-The following
account of a Ganda goose is so extraordi
nary. that I a:n aware it would with
difficulty gain credit, were not a whole
parish able to vouch forthe truth of it. The
Ganda geese are not lond of a poultry yard
but rather of a rambling disposition. One
of these birds, we observed to attach itself
in the strangest and most affectionate man
ner. to the house dog and would -never
quite the kennel, except for the purpose of
feeding, when -it would return again im
mediately. It always sat by the dog, but
never presumed to go into the kennel.
except in rainy weather. Whenever the
dog barked, the goose would cackle and
run at the person she supposed the dog
harked at, and try to bite him by the heels.
Sometimes she would attempt to feed
with - the dog; but this the dog, who treat
ed his faithful companion rather with in
difference, would not permit. This bird
would not go to roost with the others at
night, unless driven by main force ; and
when in the mornings she was turned in
to the field she would never stir from the
yard gate, but sit there the whole day in
sight of the dog. At last, orders were
-given that she should be no longer molested
but suffered to accompany it as she liked,
being thus left to herself, she ran about
the yard with him all the night, and what
is particularly extraordinary, and can he
attested by the whole parish, whenever
the dog ran out of the yard and ran into
the village, the goose alwuys accompanied
him, contriving to keep up with him by
the assistance of her wings ; and in this
way of running and fsying followed him
all over the parish. This extraordinary
affection of the goose towards the dog,
which continued to his death, two years
after it was first observed, is supposed
to have originated from his having acci
dentally saved her from a fox in the very
tnoment of distress. While the dog was
ill. the goose never quitted him day or
tnight, not even to feed; atnd it was appre
hiended she would have beetn starved to
death, had not orders been given for a
pan of corn to be set every day by
tte kennel. At this time the goose getn
erally sat in the kennel, and would no'
suiffer any person ever to approach it
excep~t the person who brought the dog's
or her own food. The end of this faithful
bird was Melancholy ; for when the dog
died she still kept possession of the kennel;
and a new house-dog being introduced,
which in size and color resembled that
lately lost, the poor goose unhappily
deceived, and going into the kennel as
usual,the new inhabitant seized her by the
throat and killed her.

to the practice atnong our friends in the
country-we mneani the femtale as well as

was said, also, to prevent them from be

orderly members of the Baptist Church, and a
large circle of friends and!relations to mourn
his loss. -
The deceased was born in North Carolina

he emigrate:d into South Carolina, married his

where they have continued to live, respected

says, that on the new Treasury Notes, it is an
nounced that they will be purchased at par by
the Government depositories on demand. So
it appears that the promise to pay in specieg
the end of the year, was not put' in from oili
dience to us, hut to the law of Cnngrifes, which
requires that the Treasury Notes shall be made
payable in that manner.
