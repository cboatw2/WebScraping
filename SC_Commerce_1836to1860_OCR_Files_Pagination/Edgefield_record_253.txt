OUa CTy.-Anniversart-of the Great
Fire.-The number of stores. dwellings,
&c. excluding back buildings. destroyed
by the great fire was a little over 500. Of
these it must be remembered the far great
er part were wood and old, and many of
them comparatively valueless. Since the
fire there have been rebuilt(including aliout
40 now in progress) nearly 180 huildiigs.
all o, brick, excluding, as before, kitchens
&c. which in Southern cities are a neces
aary adjunct to every habit-ition. A mong
these should -be noticed 3 Churches. (all
restored in a style far superior to those
destroyed,) and the CharlestoU Hotel re
built on the former plan. King street is.
we think, fully half rebuilt, and probahly
the value of the buildings there is greater
than that of all which were destroyed im
that street. Meeting street is rapiily ris
ing from its ruins, and bids fair to go ahead
of its neighbor in banishing the last e
mains of the conflagration. We confident
ly anticipate that these two important
treets, with those that connect them, will
in the course of another year be complete
ly restored. In that consummination Charle"
ton will have, in a great measure, forgot
ten the great fire. That part of the city
between Meeting street and the Bay, will
no doubt wait on the more central and
valuable district, and will wear some me
morials of the conflagration for years to
come. But even here,there are now abun
dant evidences of enterprize.
Many fine bnildings have been erected
in Society-street, several in Hasel, a fiqe
block on the Bay. and Market street is
chewing signs of life- In almost every
case too, the new buildings are a great
improvement on the old, h hich is to be
attributed to the brick law, the blessings
of which will be both great and lasting.
As instances of this improvemet. cott -
pare the massive and imposing block at
the corner of King and Society streets:
the tasteful row opposite to it. Maj.Black's
buildings near Market street, and many
that might be pointed out on both King
and Meeting streets, with those which we
have replaced. and what a change for the
better! We should also notice, as an im
provement likely to add much to the beau
ty of Churleston, the taste for granie
fronts, the credit of iniroduciug which, is
we believe due to Mr. Boyce, in the con
struction of the noble tange known a.,
the Pearl-street Row. This range, con
sists of 20 wholesale stores . though it
comes not strictly within the limits of our
loresent object, yet should be mentioned as
an entire addition to the business accom
todations of Charleston, no part of it be
ing finished at the time of the fire, and
much the greater part having been built
since.
We make no comment now on the
statements we have exhibited above-they
have a language of their own that is bet -
ter than rhetoric, and will give the world
fairly to-understand, that the progress of
Gharleston is onward!

THE COTTON TRADE.
A FAcT,-The Steamer Sam Jones ar
rived last week with a freight of 700 bales
of Cotton, from Macon. Georgia, at $2
per bale f&eigbt, and has returned or will
return with a return cargo of $150,00ti
worth of goods for the country trade.
This is one of a number of facts which
might be stated, shewing the advantages
we have for concentrating a controlling
share of the Cotton trade; a little exertion
only need be atdded, and a smnall outlay of
capital, in aid of the natural facilities to
-ensure such a concentratitin in a few
mouths. Not at all interfering W~th our
great Rail.Road to the West. the openinic
a communicationl with the cismbnt ane re
gions of the South and South West, will
in fact secure the stability of that road,
which must profit chiefly as a travel road.
and the travehltvill of course increase to
wards that point where capital and trade
shall most accumulate. The plying of
the now boat Savannah, outside passage,
between Savannah and this port, is ano
ther step in promoting the desired result.
Cententary of Methodim.- A General
sneting of the members of the Methodist
Episcopal Church, in this city, was held
in the Light street Church, on Monday
evening; the object more especially in
view, was to take the inittatory steps for
joining with the Chmur'h in Europe, in
commemorating, in a suitahle manner, the
completion of the first century, since the
-foundation of the Methodist Church,whuich
will take place in October next. " A
.thank offering" made during the meeting,
according to an appr-oved custom of the
Church, in aid of the various charities anid
benevolent instituginna on the occasion,
is said ta have amounted to nearly seven
teen thoutsand dollars. A cheering exam
of well directed liberality.-Birtimcre
*The-fbieriff and Clerk of the Court of
Monroe county 31ississippi, have both re
signed their oflices. The object seems to
bave been to prevent the sitting of the
-Court and thereby to prolong the time of
broeuring judgeiments upon .cases which
bad been placed .in suit. The el'et will
bedso give those, .in-debt, a few months of
grace, but the preedent was undoubtedly
a very had one. -Every thing which has
a tendency to impede the progress of the

The May Festival at Edgefidd C. H.
We have prepared an account of the cel
ebration of this Festival, which we will
publish shortly. In the mean time, we
recommend patience to all concerned.
Remarks of the Hon. E.Moore.-Accor
ding to promise we commence publishing
the remarks of this gentleman, on the sub
ject of abolition. We deem it unnecessa
ry to make any apology for their great
leogth, as they are worthy of all commen
dation, and the subject is of high impor
to the South.
The news from England (says
the Charleston Mercury.) comes so void of
all details, that there is only occasion for
a single remark. The action of Congress
seemi to have been anticipated by the
English politicians, without giving occa
sion to any fears that it would add to the
causes for-war. The danger of war, there
fore, from excitement, may be considered
as passed.
The West Indies.-The Jamaica Cour
ier gives a gloomy picture of the appren
ticeship system in the Parish of Trelawny.
The price of labor there has greatly risen;
the number -of laborers has diminished,
and the amount of labor performed by
each negro is less than it was previous to
tho act of emancipation. These are the
bitter fruits of abolition in one of the finest
islands in the world !
Business in New York. A now impetus
has been given to trarte ih this Cit. It
appears, from several accounts which we
have seen, that business is flourishing to a
greater extent than ever in New York.
Mezrico.-The Castle of San Juan de
Ullna was delivered up by the French to
the Mexicans, on the 8th uIt. The troops
of Vice Admiral Bandin evacuated Vera
Cruz on the 7th alt. and the Mexican flag
was then raised aloft.
A Now Oleans paper of the 27th ult.
gives an account of the installation of San
ta Anna in the Presidential Chair, and of
the raising of half a million of dollars
from the clergy.to carry on the war against
the Federalists. The cause of the Fed
eralists, (the anti-government party,) at
Ihe latest date, was gaining ground rapidly
in all the northern provinces.
Rcbbery of the Bank of the Metropolis
at Washington City.-The Globe says
that Mr. Dennis G. Orme, a Teller in the
Bank of the Metropolis, very respectably
connected, and having a handsome patri
mtny, recently took 350,000 from the
Bank. Upon investiention, he confessed
that he had handed it over to a Mr. A.W.
Goodrich, a Clerk in the War Depart
ment. Mr. Goodrich was arrested and
stated that he had received it for safe keep
ing, as Mr.Orme wvas drinking and crazy,
at the timne he saw him with the money.
Two or three witnesses~in a great degree,
corroborated the statement of Mr. G.
Hoth Mr.. Orme and Mr. Goodrich were
then discharged. The latter, however,I
was afterwards required to give hail in theI
sum of $2000, for his app~earance at the
next Criminat Court for the County of
Washington. The whole amount of mo
ney was returned by Mr. G. except 8200.
At the latest date, Mr. Orme had not been
re- arrested.
The political game of Ches.-We find
under the head of "Varieties," in the
Journal of Belles Lettres, the following:
" The Argus says that Lord Melboutrne is
about to publish a new work on Chess, in
which is fully exemplified the best method
of playitng the Queen; of getting posses
'ion of the Castle, and of entirely disre
garding the old system with regard to the
utility and service of the Bishops." Chess
players will ttnderst and this. Those who
have read any thing about the present po
litical condition of Great Britain, will also
understand it. They know that the Bish
ops of the E~nglish High Chureh, are in
bad odor with a large portion of the peo
ple, who do not believe "in their utility
and servtce."
The VicePresidenc.-T he Louisianian
strongly advocates the claims of Mr. For
syth, to the V. Presidency. In the event
of the resignation, r non-electi'on of Col.
Rt. M. Johnson, the present imecntboni,to
the office, at the next term, the editor of
that paper recommends the Secretary of
State, to the support of the Democratic
party. The editnr speaks very highly of
the gallant old Colonel, hut evidently wish
es him to retire, and give place to the ac
complished Georgiamn. He greatly lauds
the cotmmanding talents of Mr. Forsyth,
and says that he "has discharged the func
tions of every species of employmeat un
der the Govern ment-legislat ive, judicial,
diplomatic and oxecutive. In each and all
of these -varidus parts, he acquitted him
self with honor." It seems plain to us,
that a portion of the Van Buren party are
anxious to rid themselves of the V. Presi
dent. They wish him to retire. Ho ap
pears "to hang as a mill- stone round their
necks." We feel g-rateful to the al.-11.
reteran for hia uilitary services, but we
have always -thought that he was notjRn
his right place. He neverfibedthe' chair
of V.President. His election to his present
high office, we never approved, for vari
Dus reasons. Let him retire, and we will
say in all sincerity,
Requiescat in pace.
An old Fable adapted to modern times.
Two men who had a deadly hostility
to each other, sailed in the same ship.
One sat at the prow, the other guided the
helm. A furious storm arose, and all on
board were in despair. He whosat at the
prow. was requested to give his assistance
to prevent shipwreck. ..No!" said he,
let the ship go dlown, for my enemy will
perish with her!"
It is recorded of Daniel Webster, that
when a particular measure was under dis
cussion in the Senate of the United States.
that he remarked, "I would not vote for
this bill, though the enemy were thunder
ing at the walls of the Capitol !" l'erish
the noble ship of State, since my enemy
the President is at the helm, and will go
down in her! What an awful commen
tary upon the opposition of a portion of
the Whig leaders! Yet this man, Daniel
Webster, is called by his satellites, a Pa
triot!
AMOS KENDALL.
Oh Amos Kendali!-Phoebus What a name,
To fi the speaking trump of future fame!
BRyoti.
The whole country has rung with the
name of this Prince of American Post.
Masters. From the disputed territory in
the State of Maine, to the remotest boun
dary of Louisiana; from the islands on
the coast of New York, to the distant set
tlements of the Oregon, this name is
sounded without the least cessation. If
you go to the crowded commercial mart,
it strikes upon your car. If you go to the
sequestered village, you bear it still. If
you ly to the rural districts of our coun
try, the name meets you there. 'Tis Ken
dall! Kendall, forever! All North Amer
ic4 speaks of Kendall. A large portion of
North America curses Kendall! All the
Whig papers teem with abuse of Kendall.
So do some Democratic papers. Editors
revile him for his rude insolence, or inde
pendence, we do not know which. Mail
contractors curse him, because they can
make no money in dealing with him. le
is too sharp-sighted a Yankee for them.
Does a paper from Washington, fail once
in the year to come to a subscriber? He
curses Kendall. Amos has kept it back!
Do numhers of the Globe go in shoals
from Washington to any post otlice? Ken
dall sent them. He wishes to create a fa
vorable impression for himselfand the Ad
ministration. Does the stage, running to
a remote village, break down, and half a
dozen subscribers thereby fail to receive
their papers for a few hours? Amos is the
cause of it. He is the cause of all the
detention and miscarriages of lettera -and
papers over this extensive country! What
ever is wron'g in the maiL arrangements, is
attributed to him. The sins of 8000 piost
masters,and of stage drivers innumerable,
are chargeable to him! He bears on his
hea-l, the iniquities of them all! The
Whigs call on the President to dismiss
Kendall. He twill nsot. The Conserva
tives takes up the cry. The Presidlent
hears them not. Whigs and Conservatives
command, entreat, threaten, curse. Amos
will not resign ! He is as firm as Mont
Atlas.
''Thou hast seen him
When storms and tempest. thunder round his
brow,
And oceans break their billows at his feet,
He stands unmoved, and glories in his height."
The enemies of Kendall assail him in vain.
He holds on to office with the gripe of
death! He woill not let go. He is not yet
gorged.

Rutherford, Burke, Yancy,- Buncomibe,
Henderson, Hay ward, Macon, and Chero:
kee Counties, in N. Carolina." These
Circulars are veryfashionable in N. Caro
linea In that State,Members of Congress
write them, we believe, every year, giving
a general view of the policy of the Gov
ernment, either favorably, or unfavorably,
according to their own political notions
Like his colleagues, Mr. Graham has given
his views at length, on several important
qtuestions. He commences his Circular
by giving his constituents the follow
ing neoul and highly interesting infor
mation.
"Fellow Citizens:-The 25th Congress
expired on the.3d day of this month; andi
with it, the term for wvhich I was elected
your Representative in that body. Or
dinarily, Congress holds its seasions but
stee a year. .In the last two years, how
ever, there hheq been three sessiens. You
rememher ceitain experiments were made
by the Government on the finances and
turrency, in which I couldonot concur, lbe
liev-ing it is always wisest and best to 'let
well enough nane'
Verily, thd- honorable gentlenanprep
unimed'inuch upon th:e ignorance of: @6s
eonstituentes as he ilought it necessary to
inforn:them that .Cbngress usually held
its isssions but onceayear. We think it
probable that they were apprized of.this
fact,before the appearance fttie'Circular.
They were not so ignorant as their fli-nid
Representative supposed they Irei. But
Mr. Graham is a Whig, and like manyfof
his brethren, he thinks that. the peopleare
exceedingly ignorant of Government lif
fairs, ana need much iastruction 'froin their
intelligent Whig teachers. The Sub.
Treasury is his abomination. He em
ploys the following powerful arguments
agaiust it.
" The President in his sub-treaeury
scheme, proposes to furnish relief to the
Government, but none to the people. Now
I think this partial, unequal, and unjust.
The banks have all, or nearly all, again
resumed specie payments; aud their notes
are current, and constitute the chief cir
culation of the business transactions of the
country. The expenditures of the Gayr
ernment have recently been between thir
ty and forty millions of dollars a years-I
Now, suppose forty millions of dollars in
gold and silver he abstracted from the
banks and the people, to pay and support
the expenses of the Government, there is
one half the coin in the country suddenly
withdrawn from the trade and commerce
of the people. This would be killing the
goose that laid the goldeneggs.. It would
inflict a fatal blow on credit and. confi
deuce, which constitute the very spirit
and soul of trade and commerce. Anoth
er suspension of specie payments would
follow, prices would quickly. fall; and the
States and people would suf'er great em.
barrassment and distress. The sub-trea
sury proposes two kinds of currency-the
better sort for the Government; and ther
baser sort for the people; gold and silver
for the President and office holders; bani
bills and depreciated paper for the peope
and tax payers. Now, I see no sort of
equality in this proposition; but rank in-.
justice. What! shall a partyof individuals
1 ho happen to be members of Congress,
and dressed with a little liisf authoiitj,
vote to feed themselves out of the public
treasury with silver spoons out of golden
dishes; while their constituents are'Aje d
off and fed with horn spoons out of woodn
irenchers? Surely, surely there can be no
equal rights in this!"
In his circular he speaks about defalca.
tione, public lands, the expenditures'alid
appropriations of the Government aboli-'
tion, and other pnllie matters. Wei make
the following "elegant extract" upon abo4.
lition.
"The subject of abolition frequently x
cites otrong and angry feelings in Congress.
It is a very delicate and dangeruis ques
tion. and it requires much prudence and.
vigilance to guard off the assaults and as
sassinatiuns which those deluded fanatics
and misguided philanthropisiawuld in
fict upon the Union and thierighis of
Southern institutions."
Mark the classical beauty of- th x-..
pression, "the assaults and -hb-s-r-t0ss
-which fanatics would insjict upon the
Union!" The style. of the circular is
unique. It comes -under no.-partiettlar*
kind, of wh1ch writers on .rhetoric have'
given an account. We would character
ize it as the Homespun style. It is just
such a style as suits the backwoods of N.
Carolina.

Mr. Editor, -
I read in a late No. of your paper, an
article extracted from the Boston Mer
cantile Journal. headed- "the New Art or'
*the Pencil of Nature." -The French 'it
seems, claim the glory of a "'wonderfnl
discovery made by- M. Daguerre; that of.
transferring the picture of any- object to
paper by the action of solar light. The
English too are laying elaim to a similar.
discovery made by H. Fox TPalbot. Why
should America he backward in asserting
her claimi It is afact that Professor El
lett of the South Carolina College, has
bean teaching the Art to hiis Class,'ever
since be has 'been in .the State, and that
there is evidence incontrovertible, that he
made the discovery four or five years ago,
His mode is doubtless, similar to that of
Mr.-Talbot. IIe reveree..thie natural ef
