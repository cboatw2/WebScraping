The following report of a trial which re- v
.ently took place'in England details the- .s
. particulars of a series of extensive forge- (
ties in-Eope which bear some similitude I
to-the forgeriesrecently committed -in this k
cogntry by-the New Orleans operator:
Anaction, brought by Mr. Bogle against b
Mr. Lawson, the publisher of the Times
newspaper, for a libel published in that i
journal, 'was tried before Chief Justice R
Trindal and a Special Jury, at Croyden p
Assises,on Tuesday. Tje plaintiff was 1
a banker at Florence. and the agent of i
Mesrs. Glyan. Halifax & Co. The li- h
bel'which the Times had published was to e
the efect that the plaintiffwns engaged in
a couspiracy to defraud Messrs. Glynn,
Halifia & Co. and various Continental
bankers, by the presentatiou off forged let
tu.apf redit; and it appeared in a para
04p headed ".xtraordinary and Exten
essaForgery :' which profe..ed so give the ,
evidence of one Perry, a conspirator, who d
bad-been examined before the Police at i
Brussels, und copies of some letters which j
bad been intercepted between the conspi
rators, both of which mentioned Rlogle as r
being implicated in the fraud. The pulp- c
lisher of the Times pleaded a justificat ion. v
The fraudulent scheme originated with the I
Marquisde Bourbelles, a rei-ident at Flor.
cnes aed Leghorn, who uied Bogle's bank.
Another conspirator wa- a Mr.'Grahlmn.
Bogle's stepfather. who once represented
thecountv ufStirling in Parliament. The!
Marquis's plan was to procure a leier of
credit from the house of GlyUn & Co., and
tohavea plate engraved in exact copy of
the original of this so faras its form wveni -
.o purchase paper of a similar quality to
that of Glynn & Co's letters of credit, for
the purpose of taking impressions of the
plate; to procure the means of exactly
forging the signature of Glynn & Co.; and
when all else was prepared. to present the
forged letter to each of the numerous agent,
of Glynn & Co. throughout Europe, andi
simultaneously, by the Conspirators; who
should afterwards as,.emble at an appoin
ted'place of meeting and divide the -poil;
after which the whole were to decamp top
Jndia,.Africa, America or China. The V
4rst prt of the scheme was succesfily
carried out; the forged letter wat comple
ted all but-the signaure. For this, accor
ding to the Times, Mr. Bogle procuredi the
model, in a letter of credit, which was left
at his bank by the peson in whose favor
it was drawn; Bogle borrowing it fron
another person in whose custody it was
left. It was proved or :i, defendant in
the action, that the time when this letter
wastorrowed was just after the return of
the Maquis de Bourbelles from Engiand.
with the impressions of:he for4ed plate;
that on.the retun of the Marquis to Flor.
ence,.Er. Bogle was seen closeted with r
him for several hours in his department
of the bank, with the door locked, which
was quite unusual; the defcndent also as
sorted, and brought Mr. Kerrick, the per
son from whom the letter was borrowed.

and upon their being rend G~ir to tIbgle,
1e behaved unlike an innocent man. gave
way to despair, said he was ruiued, and
reired immediately from conuoyion with
the bank Stress was also laid on the fact
jiroved that on the Graham. leaving Flor
ence, some things were sent to the bank to
be taken care of as the propierty of IBogle,
which were aftera'ards found to include a
-tracingmachinr instrument for taking
fac-similes of handl writing. The signa
sures of all the letters were so exactly like
Mr. Halifax's writing and like each other.
tiat Mr. Geo. C. Glyren, his partner, and
the clerks itn the bank, could hardly say
which were fqrgeries or w hich were not.
The defendant also proffered the deposi
5 tio- off'erry at Brussels, that he had been
told by one ofthe rahmams. who was un.
aloutedly a conspirator, that Bogle- was
implicated in the plot; but this was rejec
ted by the Judge, becausec the matters
mentioned were not withitn Perry'.. nn
knowledge. But the evedenmce on which
the defendant most of all re-lied to prove
Bogle's gift, was in the shape of copiies
fromoriginets, in French archives, of let-I
ters which had passed be-weun ithe chiief
consdrators, in which Bog~le was mtentio n
ed by name as one of* their party. The
reception of these in evidence w as oppo
sed, eon the ground that the origtiuals cotnidi
not be procured. The defendanmt had bent I
barristers and personas of intelligence to
Paris, Brussels, Osteud, G;eneva, Turin.
Bologna, Florence, Parma. Cologne. Liege
(bdnt, Antwerp, Cobletntz, and in fact to
every place ini Europe where traces of
evidence might be procured: and these
leters were the fruit of that wide and cost
ly search. On the sumnming up, the Jury
-war advised to threw them out of c~on..id
erauion. The Jury returned a verdict for
the plaintiff-damages one fariting.
The Caroline-Trial of Mceod.-W e I
-have had an interview with Mr. WVells.
- ~the owner of the steamer Carolinie, and one
of the principal witnesses on the trial of
McLeod at Utica. Mr. WVells is an itelli-<
gent and respectable mao, and his stat
mneats may be relted upon. As the trtal
will not be called on till Monday. he has
come to this city to transact somo business I
and procure the attendance of two wit- I
nessesses, who, subsequent to the Navy I
islaud affair, enlisted to the U. 8. 2d Ar
Mr. Wells informs us that he purchased
the stateboat Caroline a few weeks before -
she was destroyed. Though possessed of I
considerable property, he had never own
ed a steamboat before,Iand was very proud I
of the Caroline.
The Navy Island expedition had proved
a failure-there were not more tharr three
hundred men on the Island-provisions
had stopped coming in-they were in a
etate of starvatmon, and were anxious to get
of frn the -Island. For that purpose I
they made. overtures to charter the Carm
bie. Thes. Mr. Wells .wholly refused.
-He got dtsthe boat upon the solo condi- 4
tion,Ahath@ should run her upon his own
bool, cliirlgigwhat ho -pleased for fer- 4
riage,hbd go when and where he pleased.

Mr. Wells was in the Caroline when she al
asiroarded. The ohry weapon on board is
as a pocket pistol, in the pocket- of i
'apt. Haggerty, comm'ander of a brig on
take Erie, which he did not probably It
now lie had. which was not loaded and a
hich there was nut powder enough on i
Dard to load. U
Air. Wells stood under the deck, when i
ie party from Canada boarded her. At

arty was simply to take possession of the C
out. lie had to idea of any other vio- a
suce, than being turned ashore, until he n
eard a cry of "no quarters!" and the b
op, mencement of the work f death. tl
He saw Durfee taken from the fire-room, v
nd supposed when the man approached a

On the part of the prosecution, the fact t
rib Caroline being unarmed and un- i
artered will be fully - proved. No man I
rill swear that be saw lcLeod shoot

once, proved to be a miserable wretch, I
who could 'not tell in what year the Caro

his may be, the trial is of the highest im- I
rtantce in a national point of view, for
t will be shown beyndul all futrther - ques

'of the most iitense descrio. Pub

mnuring the act referred toopdaPOdging
ie members to be ready at a moment's
aruing to repel any farther incOVsions of
te British Tories. . .
The feeling in this section of the coon- 1
y against her Majesty's government in
|anada, is very strong, audjras been kept
live for the last few years by the pat riot
invements, and the outrages which have
eon committed from time to time, and
Mts last outrage is more than they seem
iiing peaceably to withsktnt. There
re a g'eat many private itories of
rms and ammunition in this ttion, and
have no doubt that an arm9 olive thou
and volunteers for the invastbi ofCanada
oulid be raised in a fortnight, if it was
bought the general and staemfgeernrnnts
vould not iterfere. l .
It is said that papers haveNen circula

have no doubt that a rescn f Col. Gro

ome time all along the frontier, from the

he factious spirit, the most fearful conse

I w ill keep you informed'of any move

The Grogazn Afair.-After all, it is not
robable that any ditliculty will grow out
C the abduction of Grogan.
The force seizing him. it turr.s out, was
lot the regular, but a volunteer force. An
1. S. oflicer at Alburgh, according to the
kmnerican writes to this city, that so far as
L could be ascertain. the act had no sauc
ion of any commanding officer.
Again, the opinion in Canada seems to
'e that if he were seized as alleged, he
nust be given up and the abductors must
>e 1%.1ished.
G; governmet is doing its duty, we ire
ssured, with the testimony before it, and
io doubt when its representations reach
uirRichard Jackton, the new Governor
;eneral in Canada, lie will do this dutv too.
The Montreal Herald, one of the most
'iolent of the anti United Statesjournals in
wanda. has the following I
"It is said that Grogan who was lodged
n.jail the other day chian "wilh arson,
ras kidnapped on the .rilrican side of the
ine and carried into Canada. Whether
ruo or false, we are sure the American
;overnment will lose no time in assertitg
ts truth, tie has fulfilled the secret wishes
f that government too well for it not to
ittemipt defrauding justice of its ldue. lIf
rue, the hands of British authorities must
te kept clean. No countenance otughit to
