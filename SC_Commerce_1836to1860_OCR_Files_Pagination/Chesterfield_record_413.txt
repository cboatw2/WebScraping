pleasure to gratify the friend who sent it, but
in the type we use it would fill about two

with advertisements; and publishing
it would lay us uuder obligation to publish
also the counter report of tiie minority, of

Mr. Curtis, the Chairman of the Commitee

The suggestion in the following communication
of establishing a system of
inspection of cotton, comes from a highly
respectable planter. We invite attention
to it.
. For the Farmers* Gazette.
Sumlcrville, July 31, IS40.
Sir:?Your goodness in publishing a
|)ie?*c of mine has emboldened me again
to trespass on you.
The quantity of land to be planted to
each hand must depend on the nature
of the soil, and the number of ploughs to
he used. The young planter will be
aided in forming an opinion on this head
be die usage of his vicinity. The difficulty
is in adjusting the relative proportions
of land for provisions, such as
corn, (with peas interspersed,) potatoes
&c and that for market crops, such as
cotton, rice, wheat, indigo, hemp and
pindars. 1 think the proportion of land
should be in favor of the provision crop
rather than of that for market.
The benefit of a greater production of
provisions would be that our stock
would be much improved in size, strength^
and health, and the quantity of milk be
greatly increased?a large proportion
i?f the proceeds of our market. A
great crop would then remain with the
planter to increase ins estate, ana not ue
expended in the purchase of meat,
jorscs, mules,,&c. as is now the practice
willr too many. The quantity ot cotton,
fee. would be much diminished but the
jualitv improved; which would raise at
lotne and abroad the character of this
staple, and I have no doubt enhanse the
wire and expedite the sale. The article
?f Cotton is cultivated too much with a
iew to the quaiitity'and not the quality,
dould the planters-be brought to believe
:hat it would be to their interest to have
:heir Gottorx all out of the field by the
niddle of ^November, the most of it
would be of tli'e 1st and 2nd quality,
nstcad of 1st, 2d, 3d, 4th, &c. qualiies:
it Would be clean being better handed:
& it would be sooner in or ready for
narket. The planter would have more"
ime to improve his plantation, in clearng
laird, putting up and repairing
juihllngs and fences, draining and making
manure for the succeeding crop.?
l.le would feel himself more independent:
nuch of tire , winter might be spent by
he females in spinning and making'
:loths for summer.
1 may be asked, how is this regulation'
:o be eftecteilr?I answer by legislative
ictifln. Hut one may say, I have a
ight to plant what, and as much as 1,
dense, atul to restrain me, would be to
nfringe upon my rights. I humbly
hink not so. The object of all governncnts
is to irtake laws for the individual
ml general good, although they may
ppear to infringe upon personal rights,
take it for granted that every person
in becoming a member of society gives
ip some riglits to be secured in others,
fhe legislature may establish an insoecion
of Cotton, the establishing of which j
m doubt would improve the character j
f our Cotton. Flour, Pork, Tobacco, j
5cc. are now inspected in some states
nupli to the bcnctit of the growers of
itcse articles. I presume 1 have said
Miough to draw attention to tliis subject
:o excite persons better qualified than
hyself to undertake the discussion of it.
1 hope what I have written may draw
vat experienced planters and able writers,
to cither support my views or suggest
better. The subject is one of
mportance and one on which much may
3e said. * .. '
ShouM I be tliougiit to have suggested
in unwise measure, or one of injurious
xndency, 1 hope the error may be attributed
to my inexperience. My wish is
[o improve the agricultural character of
my country. TYRO.

Dear Sir:?Sonic few weeks since I saw in

ine Irish Potates presented to you hy Mr. A.
[\ L^coste, weighing from 10 to 12 ounces. I
lave raised a considerable quantity this sumner
weighing from 11 to 1G ounces and meas.

My mode of raising them is as follows. The
alter part of February I make trenches about
10 oi 12 inches deep by running a plow two
?r three times in a p'acc and scraping
:hern out with a hoe. In these trenches I
ml a small quantity of Stable or other strong
nanure, drop the potatoc and fill the trenches
vith half rotted straw or trash from the woods

scatter leaves or other trash about four orfiye

Indian Netqp. ?On Tuesday, 14tl> instant,
two discharged soldiers left Fort
Fanning for Ncwnansville, and after re
maining over night at Fort White, recently
abandoned, they left this latter place
on Wednesday morning on their journey.
After having travelled about six miles
eastward, near a place called 44Cow
Creek," they were killed and scalpedby
Indians, where their bodies were fourwl
by the express rider from the Suwannee.
Capt. Ellis, in command of Fort Gi.lliland,
as soou as the intelligence reached,
him, repaired to the spot with twenty
^men, and interred the bodies, lie found
it impossible, however, to trail the Indians,
and returned to Ncwnansville.
ft is supposed they followed the creek to
its mouth, whore it empties into the San*
j ta Fe, and there crossed the river about
I two miles from the scene of murder. ?.
I Signs are also reported near Alligator.
Stillfurther.?On Thursday, Kith inst.
j two dragoons, bearing the express from
Pilaka to Fort King, were killed when
about nine miles from the latter posf.After
they fell from their horses, they
ran about a hundred yards, when the
Indians overtook them, and cut and
mangled their bodies in a horrid manner,,
the head only of one being found, and
parts of the body of the other.
On Sunday, 10th inst. two men attached
to the Infantry Corps, were -passingbetween
Fort Fanning and Fort'NVhite,
and were killed within about seven-miles
1 of the latter place.
j On Monday, two others belonging to
; the same Corps, were killed about 9
miles from Micanopy, being on their
way to Fort Fanning; *
On the same rnQrOTpf". {^Monday) the
express rider, after having left Micanopy
about a mile saw two Indians standing
in the road, but managed to elude dis
covefy until lie had passed, them so far
as to be beyond the reach of their rifles.
They discharged he supposes, about fifteen
rifles at him after he hud got beyoud them.
The report of the rifles, and yell
of the Indians, was heard at Micanopy,
and on repairing to the spot, signs of from
80 to 100 Iritl.ians were found.
