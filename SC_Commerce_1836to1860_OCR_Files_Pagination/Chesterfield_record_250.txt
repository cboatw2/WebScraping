lanJs is levied on an estimate of neir valu \ !
which in most instances is very greatly below |
their real valuo?and slaves may now he
stated at an avenge value ot'three hundred
dollars, so'h it in thct lands and slaves do
not pay cue third of the tax imposed on stock
in trade, and your committee believe a corresponding
taxation prevails in all the Soutu.
era and South Western States. Besides,
no regard has been had to the productive- i
ness or unproductiveness of tins stock in j
trade. Goods may have come to a falling !
market, when it might be ruinous to sell, li j
they are kepi for belter times?if they are j
not forced on the market, anJ arc at the i
end of the year found still in the hands of'
the merchant, they are. again compelled to j
pay the tax, while in the mean time interest j
and all other incidental expenses are nccu. j
mutating on the investment. In paying tax j
on lat.d and agricultural capital, it is paid on
what almost without fail yields an income i
or profit, in paying n or*commercial cap. ,
ila!9 it is paid on what may or muy not, in ;
trie fluctuations of trade, make either a profi i
or a loss. It is scarcely to be exp ceu j
that large stocks of goods, in the face of,
such a tax, can ever accumulate in the ;
hands of our merchants. Your committee.
know that it has produced thiscvi! and drive
goods from us, which otherwise would have
remained here to s<*c k a market. To secure
the trade at which we aim an J to which
the South is justly entitled, large stocks of
goodsaro indispensable. The foreign mer- j
chant a d our brethren at the North, must,
be encouraged to bring tneir goods here to !
await a sale, witii the full assurance that they ;
shall be subject to no taxation until sales shall
have been effected. Then may wc expect J
to see our wareuouses filled wi;h all kinds of!
commodities?the merchant of Manchester,!
or Leeds, or Lowell, w II not hesitate to
send his goods to be stored here. I lie im- j
port tin merchant will not have his capital j
diminished without the certainty of being i
able to make a profit to replace it. The ;
merchant, who comes from the interior lo :
lay in his supplies, will have no need to go (
to another market to fin i an assortment, or '
to make Irs purchase here, burdened by a j
tux from which he derives no benefit. It
is uot easy to estimate the impulse which
such a staie of things would give to our trade j
?how much h wou! 1 both encourage the ;
importing merchant to have always on j
hand a large stock of goods, and attract the ;
merchants from the interior to our Empori- ;
u ns 1 would encourage a competition of
boin sellers and buyers >n our markets, and
which could scarcely fail to prouuc the
most tuvora de resul s :
Your Commute** believe fS.nt lira differ?

the Southern and South Western S ates j
might avoid all ;he evils which your Com- j
mitree are p?rsuad< d, have arisen from the j
mode hitherto pursued without any diminu- j
f ton of revenue. Let the tux Lo impoat >d |

he will overestimate rather than und( r value 1
it, and a moderate equ table tax on it, your !
Committee believe, would assuredly make j

the prevalent mode of taxing his capeai?
and they submi two resolutions, which, il ?

of the Sou hern and South Western States,
so to frame their Legislature, as to encour. j
age tne accumulation of Commercial Cnpi. !

taxation, until sales of them be ef
fie ed?and that the taxes then be levied

on a charge of purloining money from the j ,

nprio.l of five full days. In the mean time j j

and in vain exhaus'cd the usual rt-! |
medics. We believe it was con- !
ceded on all hands that he must die. On !
Friday afternoon, Dr. lleinberg?a bold

fort. We are no: apprised^of tlie particulars
of the operation ; nor is it material, as the 1,
case will probably be reported for the mod- j.

by the warm ba h, and tiie free use of the j j
scarifier and cupping glass, he succeeded ! (
in drawing eighteen ounces of blood from 1 |
j
the region of the cere'Hium, which gave al- j
most instant relief. To the no small as- !
tonishment of the bystanders, the patient j (
suddenly opened bis eyes, raised himself up, j j
as it was frotn the grave, and called for wa ;
tor?a cup of cool water J [Juntoon is now |
in a fair way to recover. O.i being first :n- /
tcrrogated as to what be had been about, he t
replied that he recollected taking a pill of |
opium last n g'U. The intervening five days !,
were entirely lost, except in the accumulu- ! (

About the vear 1820. James Osborne, ;

upon a charge for assault nn?l ballerry, and ,
sentenced to pay a small fine and cost ? !
I The precise amount of tlie whole we do

ble. The amount not being paid, lie was
committed to tho jail in Danbury, where he
remained eighteen years. As the law lias
stood during th ?t period, lie could be discharged
from his imptisonnvnt, only upon
ilher paying tin* fine and cost, orgivmg his

QUARRIES UNDER THE CITY Of

The ascertained extent of the quarries
jnder the surface of Paris is G74,80(
netres, or about two hundred acres:?
viz., under the public roads or street!
182.850, and under tho other parts of flit
city 401,950 ; but it is probable that the)
extend to a much greater superficies. Judg.
ing by variations of the surface, by tnc fis.
purcs which have taken place, and by tho?<
which arc s'ili occasionally occurring, i
may be presumed that these excavation!
occupy about one six;h of the sub-surface
of the capital. The galleries which hav<
been traced under the. public ways are ir
length upwards of twenty-five thousanc
metres; but this is small in proportion t(

pans of the surface. The quarters unde:
winch the principal portion of these quarries
lie, arc the Faub urgs St. Marcel, St
Jacques, St. Germain, and Chaillot.
The quantity of stone which has heer
furnished by these quarries for buildinj
may fco es imated at 11,000,000 cu!>i<
metres; one fifth of which has probabl;
been cut info rectangular pieces, and tin
rest used as rough stonee. 'All thesi
collected into one mass would form a cub
of upwards of 220 metres square on cacl
face, and of more than three times th
height of the towers of Notre Dame. Th
quarries within the Department of th
Seine tire 9:39 in number, producing anni
a!!y materials worth 9,843,660 fr? an
employing 4,015 workmen. These result
may be thus divided :

Tho value of the produce of these quar

ted States Sena'e of that day, as reported in
some of the New York papers. The Ministerial
press is very considerate. A very
mad print, the Liverpool Mail, raves. Tne
London Morning Herald and Standard,
high tory prints of not much influence, also
talk of cannon and big guns?but the Times,
which is generally our bitterest enemy, the
organ of Sir Robert Peel and the Duke of
Wellington, as well as of he London merchants
of the Conservative faith, speaks with
unexpected force for peace. It even adI
vocates a compromise?a concession?the
I bargain of t e boundary line of the lower
part of the St. John f r the Canada road.
Now, if the great Opposition organ talks
tiius, it will powerfully advance what we
know to he tne peaceable views of the British
Miirstry. The Memorandum, of the
British Minister and Mr. Forsyth afforded
universal satisfaction. The calamity ofa war
is felt with as much force on the other side
of ti?e A I antic as on this. There was
great uncus ness in London, and >n entire
suspension ol bu-iness in all American so.

that the good understanding between the

The cause of this delay was the

Postscript,?Our own money market has
a temporary electricity in it, created by the
news of the Great Western. Stocks have
gone up a good deal. Monicd men feel
much easier. The cotton holders are d*.
lighted. There is great relief felt in Wall
street, and in all the business parts of the
city. Private letters speak of the continuation
of peace as certain. Indeed, all rational
men of all parties in England speak of
a war as fratricide. These letters also remark
that ihe arrangement of Mr. Fox and
Mr. Forsyth is considered a most happy
" one.
There were large sales of CJ. S. Bank

men. Stocks are going up as fast as they
can conveniently travel. The cotton holders
are the most delighted of all. Several
houses here, it is probable, would have
gone by the board, if the couon news had
been unfavorable, the fall of whom would
nave dragged overo'hers. Now, they have
made their thousands; and such are the
chanc-s of trade. U. S. Bank to- avis 115,
a rise of2 percent, since Saturday ; and
2 and 3 per cent, is the general rise on
nearly all stocks.
There seems to he about a general jail
delivery ofStato prisoners in the Canadas ;

Gounc.l of Upper Canada have rejected

The News.?Tun news by the Great
! Western has had a very happy effect on
j business, and tne minds of business men, (in
j the cry of N?w York, fr has substantially
! seiile I s-veral questions of trrcat importance.
The first of these is the question of war.
Wc deem ihc advices entirely satisfactory
on this poi it. If there was any doubt before,
there is none now, that our peaceful
relations with the u mother country" will not
| be interrupted. Another qu stion settled
' bv ;!: ?? newn thf ? of tbr rontinned credit
f of our Slate stocks. Some people are con..
' stantly stariiu;: doubs about the credit of
' our State stocks being maintained in Eu;
rope. Wo can see no foundation for such
| doubts. Governments aro trusted in Euj
rojse which arc incomparably less stable than
i the Governments of our States, and who
never borrowed money for any other purpose
than to enable them to desolate their own or
| some other country ; while our money is all
J expended in aidsu;? to the resources of the
J States which borrow it. Their money jg
I like wa:er spilt upon the ground which can.
I not be gathered up, or, rather, like fire
which burns up all t at is useful ; while
ours is expended in public works, which
afford a d rect revenue for the payment of
interest on th?*ir cost, while, hv Jn/tir
| cct iiifluen *e, they spread wealth on every
side. Our confederated States guatantv to
each S ate a Republican Government, and
the honor ^nd credit of each State is so in.
tcrwoven with the honor and credit of all
the other States in this respect, without in.curring
the deep displeasures of every I
member of tli?'Confederation. As to the
ab lity of the rising empires of the West k>
pay the interest on debts contracted for pub- ,
he works or to constitute bank capitals, no
| one can doubt. That abiliiy, we are con fident,
will alvays be exerted.
Another quest on of no small importance
settled by this news is, that in the cotton
war carried on b 'tween the operators of this
country and the spinners of England, brothi
er Jonathan has gained the day. The poliey
j of holding back has be n carried out with
I such strength and steadiness in this country
I that prices have been forced up on iheothI
cr side near the point where the operators
here say they ought to be. Twelve months
ago, cotton was worth just about half its
present price. Th' advance half its present
price. The advance has been chiefly pocketed
by the Americans, aod a pretty paroel
of fortunes it has distributed among us. The
cot rn Is still owned in this country. It will
now go forward more freely, and so will
probably keep down the rates of European
exch ingos, and give confidence to our
banks and moneyed men.
These views, and others of thesama sorl,
together with the flocking of the Western
merchants to the city at this their accustom-.
\ od period, have put a new face on affairs
j tins week. Business in all departments is
! much more brisk, rents are better, money
more plenty, confidence stronger, and, indeed,
the hind once more full before us.?

THE BOUNDARY QUESTION.
We are enabled to s'ate, on what we believe
to be good authority, tint such instructions
have been transmitted to her Britannic
Majesty's minister at Washington, by the
Great Western, as will obviate the necessity
of sending a special minister to London.
The seat of negociations for the final adjustment
of the boundary question is tranferred
from London to Washington; ann those
negotiations will be pressed to a definite
conclusion.
Wilmington, April 19.?Death,?Joseph
Dupre, Portuguese, was killed on the 15th
inst., in attempting to jump from the tender
attached to one of the locomotives while under
full head way. The driving wheel having
been thrown off th* track, it is supposed
that Jose overwh'lmed with consternation,
a tempted to leap off, but was thrown*upon
his head, and had his neck broke. If he had
remained upon the tender he would not
; have been hurt, as the engine was irnmcd.,
iaiely stopped by the engineer before any <
j other wheel ran off.
Horrible Murder.?Man and Wipe s
Killed.?Just as our paper was going to
press, the news of a very distressing
murder of a man and his wife on
the line of the canal in Will county, reached
the city. The man in a wrangle had given
serious offence to a few ofhis fellow laborers,
who came to his house, and while he was
standing before them trying to explain the
difficulty, one of them plunged a bowie knife
into his bowels and ripped him entirely
open. His wife, in another room, hearing
! his dying shriek, left the house to give the
I nl:?rm. Rnt lb* labourers called her, as>
suring her !h;it no harm was done to her
; husband,and that he wanted to see her. She
j returned, and no sooner had she entered
i the room than ihe knife, wot with the blood
' of her husband, was plunged into her, and
j she lldl dead upon his body, not yet cold.?

| Outrage,?A gang of fellows in the town
of Pottsfield, Monroe, Co. N. Y., some
time last week, undertook to punish an intemperate
man named Louis Tafr, for getting
drunk. They got him upon a rail, and
by frequently le.'ting him fall, bruised and
injured him so much about the breast and
bowels that he died in forty eight hours.
