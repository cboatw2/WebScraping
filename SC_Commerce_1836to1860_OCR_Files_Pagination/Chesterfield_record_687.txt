Wc understand that Major Ellerbe, of Marlborough,
lost his imported Durham bull, week
before last. Col. Marshall also lost his fine <
Durham Cow and heifer in June. We were ab- ,
sent when Col. Marshall's cattle were sick, or we
would have taken the trouble to preserve an ac
count of the svmptoms, and made a pott mortem
examination for the benefit of future importers ol l
blooded cattle. Col. Marshall's yearling bu'l is yet J
doing well, and, should he live, promises to be a j
very superior animal. All experience proves the |
great risk which is always run in importing grown j
cattle from a northern to a southern latitude. There
' seems to be little danger when they are not over a
year old, particularly when the importation is
made in Autumn.

North Carolina Election.?Full returns have
not yet been published, but the accounts received
render it certain that the Democrats will have a
majority in both brandies in the Legislature, and
that Governor Morehcad, the Whig candidate, has
been re-elected. His majority in 54 counties is
2,652. His majority in the State at the last elec.
tion was 8,235. The Legislature will have a
Senator to elect next winter, in place of Mr. Graham.
There is no doubt, wc understand, that
the result of the negotiations, carried on
in this city between the Secretary of State
and the British Special Minister Lord
Ashhurton, will be sent to the Senate this
day for consideration by that body.

NEW APPORTIONMENT ACT?DISTRICTING CLAUSE, 6iC.
Of all the measures discussed and acted on by
the present Congress, the New Apportionment
Act, with the Districting Clause, is perhaps one
of the most important, and certainly one of the
best, whether we contemplate it as a whole, or
regard the magnitude of the particular clause
which secures the rights of minorities everywhere.
The old usage of leaving the States to regulate
the manner of electing Representatives to Congress,
placed the business in the hands of the bare majority
in any one State to monopolize the federal
power in their own keeping, to be used as whim
and caprice may dictate?thereby disfranchising
the minority of their rights, as they formed no part
of the community. The " general ticket system,"
prevalent in a number of States, (.seren, it is believed,)
is one of actual usurpation, injustice, and
tyranny, and a gross injury and outrage upon the
spirit, design and tendency of the true democratic
republican principle. Under that system, nothing
is easier than that party intolerance should violate
and overturn some of the wisest and best guarantees
of the Constitution, in reference to the diversified
pursuits, habits, customs, and interests into
which the people of every State arc cl.tsscd, or
divided. Most of the Southern and Western
States, for example, have only two predominant
interests?the agricultural and commercial. The
States of the North have three predominant interests,
agricultural, commercial and manufacturing.
These three predominant interests, require for their
proper maintenance and security, that each class
of interests should have its own approved representatives,
going directly from, and responsible
directly to, those interests, on the floor of Congress.
By general ticket, the major interest or
section of a State, may set at nought and trample
in the dust the minor interest or section, with impunity.
Thus it would be easy any where for the
major interest to sink and annihilate the minor,
and with no jiossibility of redress to the latter,
except by revolution, civil war. It may not, as
yet, have been attempted, where the general ticket
system has prevailed, to exert might against right
so intolerably, as to deprive the cities and towns
of their fair proportion of Representatives in Con
gress?but this is no reason why the States and
people of the Union should not be guarded against
the occurrence of such an abuse of power as might
t>e readily perpetrated under that iniquitous system.
The 44 districting clause" of the new Apportionment
Act, remedies all these absolute, probable, or
jontingent abuses, and secures the just rights of
he people in the election of their own immediate
Representatives to Congress. And it is difficult
o understand how, and upon what principle, the
xflitician any where will be able to accumulate a
capital out of his hostility to a measure so obviirnsly
just and equitable. With respect to our
awn State, it is gratifying to reflect that two of
aur representatives (.Messrs. John Campbell, and
S. H. Butler), had the independence to make for
themselves and the State, an able and sensible advocacy
of the measure in question. We believe,
indeed, that the 44 districting clause ' may be ascribed
to Col. Campbell, who has so long and
faithfully represented the Pec Dec section of the
State. The speech of this gentleman, 44 on the
reasons filed by the President for approving the
apportionment bill," delivered July 6, (and publish,
ed in the Charleston Courier of July 23,) travels
over the whole ground as to the expediency and
importance of the question involved in the measure
itself, and as to the unusual course pursued
by the President, and well sustains the reputation
previously acquired by the speaker. A distinguished
gentleman, North of the Potomac, writing
lately to his friend in this city, speaks thus of ColCampbell's
course :
44 The movement made by one of your repre.
sentatives (Col. Campbell), to produce uniformity
in elections for Concrete, which has resulted in the
44 districting clause" of the apportionment bill, he
will never have cause to regret, although it is Raid
he has the support of only one colleague in each
House of Congress, and none that I am aware ol
from the papers of his State.* If Congress had
not acted on the subject, the general ticket system
would before this decennary has passed, have
been inevitably adopted by all the States of the
Union, to preserve their influence as compared
with the seven Slates that have already adopted,
and others that would have made their firbt clcc.
tinns under the new appoitionmcnt law, by the
general ticket."
44 .Many already declare they will disregard the
law of Congress, and admit members whether elec
ted in conformity to it, or not. But I regard the
provision as so eminently conservative to the smal
States, and particularly to the South, that I woulc
vote for no man for Congress who would noi
pledge himself to sustain it, let his qualification!
in other respects be what they might. I rcgarc
it, indeed, .as the most important measure for th<
security of our institutions, that has ever been ad
opted by Congress, and should not be lost through
the predetermined opposition of Southern men."
The loudest blustering and invective, yet cxhi
bitcd in hostility to the 44 districting clause," comci
from the extremity of the Union?New Hampshire
in the North, and Georgia in the South. But th<
|>cople of the first must have experienced a ven
melancholy decay, from the spirit ana intelligent
Tfw writer is in error here, ae to th.s paper a
least. We cordially approve of the district system
rejoice in its adoption as a triumph of principle
and unite in the award of honor and praise ti
Messrs. Campbell and Butler for their agency i)
effecting it.?Ed#. Courier.
[Our opinion is al-o in favo" of the district syt
tern. Tho' we apprehend that the refractory spij
1 its in some of the States may create some difficult
in carrying out ihr r revisions of the present law.

i there could be inveigled into the adoption of a po- '
litical notion so utterly absurd, as that their poli- i

Interest on the Pennsylvania j
' Debt.?The bulk of the Pennsylvania 1
Stale debt, which was duo on the first of )
the present month, has not yet been paid; i
nor does there seem to be any reason to r
hope that it soon will be paid. The Phil- i
ndelphia Inquirer of Saturday says: "The i;
Bank of Pennsylvania pays all sums of t
interest not exceeding fifteen dollars in \
amount; and in the course of a few weeks a
certificates will be issued for larger sums, v
payable in one year, bearing interest <j
meanwhile. The price of State fives for to
the last two weeks has ranged from thirty, c
five to forty dollars per share. The neglect
of the Legislature to provide properly a
and fully for the interest had little effect, I v
as such a course was generally anticipated ?
The condition of some of the holders is
painful in the extreme, as they have their
all invested in the stock of Commonwealth, r
and are now without the means of subsis- |1
tencc." r

j THE MAMMOTH CAVE, A CURE JOR CONSUMPTION. i
A writer in the Journal of Commerce announces
the curious and interesting fact that the atmosphere
of the famous Mammoth Cave, in Ken- '
tucky, has qualities of the highest efficacy for
diseased lungs. Dr. Mitchell, most of whose family
have died of consumption, and who was ,
himself reduced to a hopeless condition by the
same disease, believing that there were restorative
properties in the air of the cave, resolved to make
^ it his residence for a season ; and about the first *
5
of April he established his quarters near the Star
Chamber, about a mile from the entrance, whence
he emerged for the first time at the close of June.
' His health and strength were so far restored that
he rode eighteen miles on horseback. He says
that in a week from the time of going into the
cave his cough was gone, and that his appetite
and strength increased daily. He felt lonely the
l first week, but 6oon became rcoonciled to his
- solitude, and now would rather live in the cave
y than elsewhere.
Wc extract the following parages from the
article in the Journal :

' ^ A CHAPTER ON WHISKERS.
(Written for The Rasp.)
t inn a devoted admirer of Eloquence, and to
lave this propensity gratified, I attended on sevcal
occasions the deliberations of the recent Whig
Convention, and notwithstanding I was highly
Iclighted by the lofty bursts of Elocution and
(rilliant sallies of wit, I was at no time more perectly
enraptured, than on "hearing Don Whiskermdos
behind the bar of the House, defending
nost vehemently the cause of Whiskers. I Bhould
udgc that the person whom he was addressing,
:ntertaincd a repugnance to the cheek hairs, and
hat our hero was endeavoring to dissuade him
rom his prejudice. Howbeit, let him speak for
limsclf.
44 If I have .a weakness, said Whiskerandos.
[which .1 ,<joub?,) it is-for whiskers. I have a
roing out of tlje heart/or them?I prrdilecl them.
[Cultivating and wearing them myself, I honor
those who wear and cultivate them. Whiskers
ire, indeed, a possession of inestimable worth.?
Mot to mention their pre-eminent value in the
field of Mare, what have they nor accompusnca in
tbe arena of the little god of the bow and quiver ?
How many an adamantine citadd has fallen before
the power of this formidable artillery! Many
j man who else might have dragged out a miserable
existence in poverty and rags, has found
himself, almost in a day through the instrumentality
of their unfailing efficacy, rolling in wealth,
and revelling in the arms of beauty. Vide Earl
Granbury Petersburg, of Norfolk.
In my mind's eye, now, mcthinks I sec such a
ane, resolved to the utmost of his ability, to profit j
by the blessings which has been accorded to hint by I
a. merciful .'dispensation. Mcthinks I ece him
cyrlcd and pomatumed, emerging from his dress-1
ing room, the model of a whiskered beau. He
leaves his dwelling arid directs his steps to the
bqudofr <}f his' ladyc-lovo?the mistress of thousands"
of bfo&d acres and tens of thousands of;
bright dollars. He cnlcre?he approaches?he j
marks the- approving glance bestowed upon the1
well oiled t;urls that adorn his cheeks. His hand j
by accident rests upon a guitar; lightly raising
the instrument, he sinks upon his knoes before the
object,.first.(after-himself,) in his heart of hearts,
aqd thus melts into song:
i4 t a\?*_n tij ...

If more than this could be;
My whiskers huge?behold the store,
I freely bring to thee.
Each curling fibre there revca's
The hero*, ioul full well;
u My opinion of the effect of the atmosphere of |
the cave is made up from personal observation. I
a&ve known the cave for twenty nine years. I
aave been in it at all seasons of the year during <
ill kinds of weather, both day and night. During
the late war large quantities of saltpetre were
made at the cave and for this I prepared the car- !
xmated alkalies, .which are required in large pro- j
oortion to produce crystalization, &c. At that !
time from 30 to TO hands were employed in digging
ip.tbc qurth.&c. which covered the bottom)
if the cavp, and conveying it by hoppers in tl>e
:ave, about one mile from its mouth. During the
tfhole time these men were engaged, which was
or three or four years there was not a single case
>f sickness among them.
The atmosphere of the cave is dry,?and the
emperature even and equal. I have never known j
t to vary half a degree, through the year from GO >
legrees of Farenhcit. Combustion goes on well, ;
ights- burn clear,?respiration is easy. The earth
vhich had been lixiviated and thrown out of the
loppere, re-impregnates again in about three years,
ielding from 3 to 5 lbs. of nitrate to the bushel,
knimal flesh will not putrify in this atmosphere,
kor will vegetable matter decompose. Meat bung

mpregnated with nitre as to become unpleasant to

trere fed in the cave thirty years ago, are now in
perfect state of preservation ; the logs used for j
rater pipes are sound and good. Animal flesh i
tries iir the ca'vc, and becomes hard. These
icts hstirte, that men of science may compare my
oncliislons and my premises together.
At this seasoh of the year a strange current of
Vrushes out of the mouth of the cave; in the
rinter the current changes and blows equally
trong into the cave."
Alexander McLeod.?A paragraph went the
ounds of the papers, some time since, stating that
his individual had been annoyed by a mob duirig
a recent visit to Buffaloe, N. Y. A letter ,
rom himself has been published, giving the true J
version of the matter, from which we make the j
ollowing extract:
Niagara, 1st August, 1815. 1
Dear Sir?In the early part of last month I !
lad occasion to go to Butfaloe on important busi- j
icss, which I could not well transact by deputy, i
had succeeded in arranging my affairs and was
bout to leave with the afternoon cars, when a
adavcrous looking tatter-demallion named O'Brin,
an Irish Barber, who had officiated in that
apacity on Navy Island, came up to within three j
'ards of me and commenced abasing mc in his peuliar
slang. I at once saw he was a lit lf-witted j
xotic, one of those vermin called patriots. How- i
vcr, as he had the wisdom to keep at a respectable
distance, I said nothing to him. Several citieris
of Buffalo, hearing the fellow's noise, came |
ip'to me as I was going off, and entreated mc to j
emain and have him arrested. They said to mc j
le was a nuisance in the city, and h id that morn- j
ng been hooting at, and endeavoring to raise a ,
nob against, Mr. Van Burcn, cx-president of the j
Jnited States, who being on an electioneering tour
nadc a speech from the balcony of his hotel.
I declined remaining. I was not assaulted, nor
lad I any fear of personal violence. I knew well
he citizens of Buffalo, with the exception of a few
iie cowartjiy wretches, would spurn the idea of
naking an attack upon a solitary Jtr.uiger, who
latiie. quietly among them to attend to his busiicss,
and -who had never done them wrong by
vord or deed ; and as to violent language I have
tad an ample share of late. There has been a great
leal of time and ink and paper spent in abusing
Alexander McLeod, so the poor silly Irish barber
vas only imitating many eloquent speeches made
or bunkum in the legislative halls of his adopted
oontry,-and with the same view?to get his quanum
of applause from his compeers, the riff-raff.
The above is a correct account of the mob story,
he foundation for the paragraph going the round
f all the papers, and which, like all other cock
And better far?the soft heart steals
Of many a dazz.'i lg belle.
I give thee all," 6lc.
An appeal like this no woman can rtairt. The
conquest is won! and lo! our hero is made the
lord of countless wealth, and the envied possessor
of matchless loveliness. Therefore, I ask, if such
ko tko nnn-nr nf ti-liialr-.ra u-lin u-nnlH nnf ho
be-whiskercd ? And if fruit so golden may grow
from the judicious cultivation of tliis invaluable
crop; who would be so weak as to be deterred by
the sneers of envious smooth faces, from devoting
to the developement of its capabilities, tlwt time
and assiduous attention which only is necessary
to transform a ninny into a nabob. Let others do
as they will, I wear whiskers; or as Patrick
Henry said, (not the 'Convener,') 'I know not
what course others may pursue, but as far me,
give me whiskers, or give inc to the d?1!"
This knock down argument settled my hash,
Mr. Editor, and I straightway shanked it for a ;
striped pole, and had marked out upon my cheeks ]
the pathway lor a huge pair of whiskere to follow.
And now, sir, if you wish to succeed in any matrimonial
adventure, take my advice, (for I am a
Proselyte,) and follow iny example, and what you J
fail to accomplish by the glib red-rag, will be per- |
formed by whiskers.
Oh! invincible whiskers 1 !

We copy below the Prospectus of the Democratic
Review for the information of any of our .readers
who may wish to patronize it: - . j*
PROSPECTUS
TO the new volume of THE UNITED
STATES MAGAZINE AND DEMOCRATIC
REVIEW. Volume XI, commencingJuly,
1842. John L. O'Sullivan, Editor.
By an increase in the number of pages* and by
an alteration in its typographical arrangements,
the quantity of matter heretofore furnished to the
readers of the Democratic Review, will be increased
in its future numbers about seventy-five per
cent.
The Editor expects valuable aid to his own eCforts,
during the course of a coming year, from a
number of the moet able pens of the great Demoj
cratic Party?together with that of otiien, iii its
purely literary department, to which the same po1
litical designation is not to be applied. Among
I -i i .l-.-l i -J . I v

The Monthly Financial and Commercial ar!
tides, which have frequently been pronounced by
i the most intelligent criticisms during the past year
; in themselves alone worth the subscription to the
[ work, will be continued from the same able hand.
An arrangement has been made, by which thp
Boston Quarterly Review, edited by Mr. Brownson,
1 will be merged in the Democratic Review, the lat!
ter being furnished to the subscribers of the former,
; and Mr. Brownson being a frequent and tegular
contributor to its pages. It is proper to state that,
1 Mr. Brownsou's articles will be marked by his
I name?though to most readers they would doubt.
' less reveal themselves by their internal evidence;
and that it has been agreed, under the circumstances,
that these contributors shall be independent
of the usual liability to editorial revision and
control?the author alone having a similar rc.
sponsibilitv for whatever peculiarity of views they
may contain, as though appearing in the original
work which has been heretofore edited with such
distinguished ability by himself.
Among other attractive papers in preparation
I for the forthcoming volume, will be found some
personal sketches, reminiscences, and anecdotes of
the private life of General Jackson, from the pen
of an intimate friend and member of his Cabinet.

The portraits with which it is intended to illus
trate the numbers of the ensuing year, and which' *
will be executed in a fine style of engraving, by
J. L. Dick, of this city, are those of?
