THE FATHER'S FAREWELL.
Take her, she hath learned to love tlice?
Take a father's dearest pride:
Fond and faithful may she prove theo?
She is now thy chosen bride.
Take my casket's brightest treasure,
Take the sunshine of my days ;
Now thy will must be her pleasure,
Guardian of her future ways.
Thou hast culled the first sweet blossom
Sent to deck my marriage bower?
FUce her in thy sheltering bosom,
Cherish well my fav'rite flower.
Weep not, love, I do not chide thee.
Though I shed the parting tear; j
Now may heaven's good angclc guide thee? J
Go, your husband's heart to cheer.
Bat receive a father's blessing
Ere in distant home you dwell?
Mutual love and peace possessing,
Go, my children, fare vou well!

SONGS OF THE TEETOTALLER.
BY REV. GEO. W. BETHCNE D. D.
Let others praise the ruby bright,
In the red wine's sparkling glow,
Dearer to mc is the diamond light
Of the fountain's clearer flow;
The feet of earthly men have trod
The juice from the bleeding vine,
Butthe stream comeepure from the hand of God j
To fill this cup of mine.
Then give me the cup of cold water?
The clear, sweet cup of cold water:
For his arm is strong, though his toil belong,
Who drinks butthe clear cold water.
The dew-drop lies in the floweret's cup,
How rich is its perfume now ?
And the fainting earth with joy looks up,
When heaven sheds rain on her brow:
The brook goes forth with a plea6int voice.
To gladden the vale along,
And the bending tree* on her banks rejoice,
i o near uer quiei song.
Then give me the cup of cold water?
The clear, aweet cup of cold water! j
For bright is his eye and his spirit high,
Who drinks hut the cup of cold water.
The lark soars up with a lighter etrain
When the wave has washed her wing;
And the steed flings back his" thundering
mane,"
In might of the crrsttt spring:
This was the drink of Paradise,
Ere Wight on her beEuty fell.
And the buried streams of her gladneu rise
In every moss-grown well:
Then here's to the cup of cold water?
The pare, sweet cup of cold water:
Fo: nature gives to all that lives
But a drink of the clear cold water! <

COURT ETIQUETTE.
The following admirable burlesque of Court Eti.
quette is from the pen of the accomplished Miss j
Burner, author of Evelena and Cecilia, who after, j
wards became Madame D'Arblay. It waj written
while she was attached to the household of the
Queen, in the reign of George the Third. We
have copied it from the " Barney Papera," conturning
her Journal and Correspondence, now in
course of publication, in numbers, by Messrs. Carey
and Hait, of this city,
bisections for COUGHING, SNEEZING, OR MOVING,
EEFORE THE KING AND QUEEN.
In the first place, you must not cough. If you
find a cough tickling in your throat, you must ar.
rest it from making any sound ; if you find yourself
choking with the forbearance, you must choke
?but not cough.
In the second place, you must not sneeze. If
you have a vehement cold, you must take no no.
tiee of it; if your nose?membranes feel a great
irritation, you must held your breath ; if a sneeze
still insist* upon making its way, you must oppose
ht? k?*mn?r vour teeth prindintr together; if the
"> "J ?"I J = <- w
violence of the repulse breaks some blood-vessel,
ron must break the blood-vessel?but not sneeze.
Is the third place, you niu6t not. upon any account,
stir either hand or foot. If, by chance, a
Mack pin runs into your head, you must take it
out- If the pain is very great, you must bear it
without wincing; if it brings the tears into your
eyes, you must not wipe them off; if they give you
a tingling by running down your cheeks, you must j
look as if nothing was the matter. If the blood j
should gush from your head by means cf the black |
pm, you roust let it gush; if you arc uneasy to
think of making such a blurred appearance, you
must be uneasy, but you must 6ay nothing about
it. If, however, the agony is very great, you may,
privately, bite the inside of your cheek, or of your
lips, for a little relief; taking care, meanwhile, to
do it so cautiously as to make no apparent dent j
outwardly. And with that precaution, if jou even
n?aw * piece out, it will not be mended, only be
sure eithe<* to swallow it, or commit it to a ce<mer
of your mouth, till they are gone?for you must
not spit.
HUMAN PHENOMENA.
BY CHAHIXS GERICACLT.
Tnr man called in England the Porcupine Man, j
is u linking example of the vagaries to which nature
sometimes yi* Ids, The following description !
is given by Dr. Aecanius, of the Royal Society of
I/ondon.
This man, bom of healthy parents, presented
nothing rem.arkable in appearance at his birth; ]
but a few months afterwards, an infinite number j 1
of little eTcreecencoe began to appear on his body, '
which were at first supposed to be caused by an 11
eruption. It was afterwards discovered that they /
were of a homy sul>stance, whose progress nothing j '
could arreet. With the exception of the head, the I *
Palais of the hands, and the soles of the feet, his i (
whole bodv was covered with these bristl's, that f '
ir?.inbled the ends of quills seen on a fowl when j *
stripped of his feathers. They were six " lignes" j '
in lengtli and four in thickness. 1/k" the bristles [ 1
ol the hcdg?-hog, they were planted perpcoau ulurly \f
in the skin. They w< re of a livid hue, and seerr?-' '
ed transparent, when seen opposite to the light.? ! 1
When dressed and wearing gloves, this man ap-! *
pcared i-i no respect different from 1i:k fel!ow-crc;t-1 1
tures. His hair and beard were black?his lijure i (
well-made and graceful. The bristles were shed ' 4
every fall and renewed, so that he resembled an ! 5
Knimal in hair and skin. By some accident & piece ! *
of wv torn awny from his body, a*ni ea tma
p'acc these horns never again appeared. At tha '
age of twenty years, he was attacked with smallpox.
The skin peeled entirely ofl', but on his rc- '
coveiy his bristles reappeared. With this excep- j
tion, he always enjoyed good health. He married, i
and had six children, all of whom were of the J
same constitution, and like himself covered with i
horns. There was but one, (a boy,) living when j
the doctor published this account.
The 31st of December, 1752, were born in the
parish of Brassiere, in Poitou, two female children,
united from the top of the neck to the waist inclu31
ve. They had but one body between them, in
which were placed two hearts, two wind-pipes,
* ' mi __ i 1_ ?.0]1
ana two grana arteries, ine ucauo .
proportioned and were placed face to face. The J
union began just below the cars and the lower jaw.
One of the children had the right arm before, the
other the left arm behind. There was a third arm
placed between the vertebral columns, wliich grew
out of a shoulder blade, formed by two parts ossified
torether. There was only a single humerus
in the arm, a cubitus and a radius in the fore-arm.
It was only at the wrist that the united hands
could be distinguished, having ten distinct fingers,
separated by the thumbs, which touched each
other. What is most wonderful in phenomena of
this nature is, that they live to an age advanced
enough to reply to questions that are put to them.
This was the fact in the two following examples,
and merits the greatest attention.
The first relates to two children united in one,
j
natives cf Wales, and who attained an age beyond
mere infancy. It is said that they wept
when they thought of the consequences of one dying
before the other; thus proving that they lived
long enough to reflect upon their future fate,
which inspired them with such anxiety. The
work from which this fact is taken, does not inform
us at what period this took place, but limits itself
Hnnnilv. the smtlfi
VJ DLIUil^ vaav CUV vuuvuvm V4*v?j I ?w ^?
day. The second account presents more details. I
In the year 170 i, two children were bom at
Presburg, who were united together, and who liv.
until April, 1721. One of them was then attacked
by an illness of which she died ; the other survived
her but a few days. They were joined to.
getker at the end of the thorax, so that they could |
not see each other. They were placed in the con- J
vent of Silesian nuns, in their nitive city, where j
they were supported by the bounty of the Cardinal
de Sixe-Zeits, with a female who served them as
a governers, and never quitted them; for these
twins, as different in disposition as in face, often
quarrelled, and her presence was needed to quell
and soothe them.
They had each two arms and two legs. The
sensation cf hunger was not felt by them sympa.
theticaily, and their wants were supplied at different
tunes. One of them, stronger thin the other,
by resting on her side, could raise her deter, with
as much eose as to lift her arm. The other could
not perform this feat without much difficulty.?
Sometimes cnc was sick, while the ether retained
b:r health. One was beautiful, graceful, and
gentle ; the other ugly, ill-tempered, arid quarrelEeme.
The latter often became excited against
her sister, and tho governess was obliged to put an
tnd to disputes which otherwise might have resulted
in fatal consequences.
We read in a letter of Manijctta's to Dr. Jun- j
guis, that a president of the parliament of Dijon,
who was about sixty years old, when recovering
from a severe fever, had a tumour on the vertebrae
of the the two lower ribs, about tire size of a chestnut,
rough, hard, and extremely sensitive, and
which during ten years remained in the same state. :
At the end of that time, a considerable enlarge- |
meat took place, so that it resembled the horn of j
a young stag. It afterwards grew so rapidly that j
had it not becu cut from time to time, leaving al- j
ways about a finger's-lcngth from the skin where I
the part became sensitive to the touch, it would
have been more than six inches long.
In the year 1828, the barque Sachem brought
to Boston, two young Siamese, about eighteen
years old, who have been joined together since
their birth. Their" height is about five feet, their
bodies well-proportioned, their countenances expressive
and agreeable. They are strong, active, 1
gentle, intelligent, and fully of sensibility; perfectly
well-formed, with the exception of a ligament
of cartilaginous substance, which issuing from
the breust holds them firmly together. This ligamer.t
is about seven inches in circumference
and four in length ; it is elastic, and allows '
them to turn freely- They show that each has a
will of his own, by frequently directing their attention
to diiicrent objects. It is said that on
such occasions they pull one another like two dogs
under one collar. 1 hough each has a distinct
mind, yet their organization endows them with
great sympathy, for they sleep nearly at the same
instant. They enjoy an excellent appe'ite, and
are very vivacious. They walk with their arms
twined around each other's necks, like two friends.
They play chess, and have often beaten 6lrangers
at this difficult game. They will also converse
separately with different persons at the same time.
One is named Clnng, the other Eng ; but they
are frequently called together Chang-Eng.
Finally, the dwarf Gulia, who astonished all
Paris, 011 his appearance there, completes this series
of wonderful creatures.
Gulia was presented to the Academy of Science.",
on his arrival, being twenty-two yr.ars old
and only thirty-nine inches in height, about six
inches taller than the famous dwarf Bebe. He
was born in Illyria, a town not far from Trieste.
Ilis parents were well-proportioned, and Gulia himself
was 60 until his fifth year, when he ceased
growing. He was distinguished among other x
individuals of this kind by his refined appearance j
and graceful figure; he spoke five languages, viz.: j
the two in use along the Adriatic Sea, the Ger- j
man, French, and Italian. Ho was well versed J
in the fine arts, performed on the violin, was an '
excellent horseman, and showed much dexterity
in the chase.
Th?s diminutive creature ex'-itod the most j(
ively interest; all were struck with the grace and j J
dignity of his manners, as well as the perfection I
)f h's figure. His articulations were acute, and j
lis face bore a serious expression far removed I I
rom anything childish. Tlie most remarkable
. . (
act which Gulia presented, was the splendid de- j
,-elcpment of the cranium, above all, the p-ojection [ .
>f the forelie i .. It h s been compared to the head j '
>f Jupiter on the body of Apollo ; always remem- |
.rring tint it is in miniature. Gulliu had all the j
astes and pactions of other men, and love, which I
>rings distances together, can also level heights, j
.xullia is going to be married. Happily, he lias
ourd at Vienna, a lady of the same height as (
rmcc)\ with n'l the social virtues an ! attractions ! ,
i .
hat h? could desire. J
It is a striking fact in the history of this j
dwarf, that his father, mother, brothers and sister
are all remarkably tall. He ceased growing at
the age of five years, but we can hardly say that
his growth was stopped, for the state of the bones '
and the proportions show that there was notliing ^
more to be developed.
Gulia never had an illness or even a slight in. j
disposition. lie has borne the fatigues or travel, i
ling, which have affected more robust persons, i
with great ease. Ilis refined manners have gain. 1
ed him access to the best society of the Europe. 1
an courts; he has played billiards and hunted '
with the King of Prussia and Emperor of all the
Russias.?Young People's Book.

Agriculture is the foundation of all human j
arts?the art for which man was made, and j
the perfection of which is his chief happiness j ,
and glory as the lord tempore.' of th:s planet- i ,
Of this 6uhlime art, ail other arts and sciences !
are but satellites, their business being to wait : ,
cn, enlighten, and adorn it with their moonshine.
Consequently no man more rnan the
agriculturist needs the full use of his brains,
and a perfect command of all the treasures of | .
human experience. So the fanners of the 1
United States view the matter; and in presmiting
them with a translation of the cele. j
brated Maison Rustique, of the French, we
have no douot of their hearty support. It ic
the work of all works on praaical agriculture
?the most scientific, clear, and ccmprehensive,
France has long excelled in profitable
farming. This is the source of her wea'th.
England is rich by coals and commerce. Her
agriculture is splendid, but sometimes costs I
more than it comes to. Those who have
fortunes to spend may buy the vast works of
Marshall, Dickson Arthur Young, Loudon,
&,c., but those who wish to get a fortune out
of the soil will find the French writers better *
able to show them the way. The excellence ,
t?t French elementary works is well known to
all teachers. For centuries, the yi/ai6on
Rustique has been, in France, the standard
elementary work?the spelling book and
grammar of farming. The present edition for
14 the nineteenth century," has he m re-writtenand
brought up with the " march of mind," ,
by sixty of the ablest "agronomeV' of France. ,
It has "all the light of the latest improvements, ,
not only in Frauce, but in all Europe.
VVilliatn Cobbet, one of the most successful ,
farmers both in England and America, who
wrote the best style and the best French
grammer that ever was, valued the Maison
Rustiques, not only as an encyclopedia of
farming, but us a means of educating his
children. He was his own schoolmaster. In

made of this work:?
"Our book of never failing resource wa? '
the French Maison Rusiique. or Farm House,
which, it is said, was the hook that first tempted
Dugnosnois (I think that was his name,)
the famous physician in the reign of Louis
XIV., to learn to read. Here are all the fourlegged
animals, from the horse down to the
mouse, portraits and all; all the birds, reptiles,
insects; aIIthe modea of rearing managing,
and using the tame ones, and of destroying
those that are mischievous; all the various
traps,springs, nets;all the labors of the field
and garden exhibited, as well as the rest, in
plates; and there was I, in any Jeieuro mo- 1
ments, to join this inquisitive group, to read 1
the French, and tell them what it nieaned in
English, when the picture did not sufficiently
explain itself, /never have been without a
copy of this book for forty years, except during
the time that / was fleeing from the dungeons
of Castlereagh and Sidmouth, in 1817, and
when I got to Long Island, the first book I
