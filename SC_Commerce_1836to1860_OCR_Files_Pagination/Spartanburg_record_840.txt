TO the PEOPLE OF THE SLAVE-HOLD*
1NG STATES.
At a meeting of the citizen* of Rusael county,
Alabama, held at the Court House, at Crawford,
on Saturday the 8th of June, 1844, the following
Bearable and resolutions, oflbrcd by General Jas.
aititlton, were adopted without a dissenting
voice:
Whereas, The Union of tho United States, the
joint result of the virtue, wisdom and. labor of our
fathers, is worthy of oprfcftufuest and sincere
fohs for ttwprcservalioft. And whereas, nothing
can so much fliiJaniror '.?> I....... ? - ?
-- O"" **" wmuiUMIIV^i a lt'fjill^r
of distrust, and alienation anrong its members.?
And whereas, the late agitation of the slave question
in the Congress of the United States, under
memorials for the abolition of slavery in the District
of Columbia, will, in all probability, be revived
with fresh and dangerous potency nl its next
session. And whereas, the avowal of the present
Ministry of her Bfitunie Majesty's Government,
that "Great Britain desires, and is constantly exerting
herself to procure tic gencrul abolition of
slavery throughout the world," has met with concurrent
sympathy in the rapidly increasi"g fanaticism
of a portion of the people in sundry States
in this Confederacy. And whereas, if the Annexation
of Texas to the United States should be
defeated bv the rejection of the Treaty now before
the Senate, however much the factious spirit
of mere partisan politics mav contribute to iHi?
result, vet the miscarriage of this great national
measure ofinestimuble value, must be principally
traced to an innate and uncontrolable hostility to
J ^r??l ^|liV I l'tl8j it\l
tlese causes have greatly contributed to impair, if
nohebHroy, that-spirit of corcord, amity and confidence
\\fhich once blessed The people of this
country.
Be it Resolved, That the Southern States are
bound by every consideration, which is due to
their own security and to an enlightened attachment
to the Union, to take immediate steps to
prevent the catastrophe of its Dissolution, which
through their own irresolution and apathy is rapidly
approaching.
Resolved, That in the opinion of this meeting a
Convention of the Southern States ought to assemble
in Richmond in the State of Virginia, on
the 3rd Monday in October next, to take into
consideration the situation of the Southern States,
in reference to the institution of domestic Slavery
existing among them,. There calmly and dispassionately
to deliberate, whether under the compact
of Union, the Congress of the United States have
a right to violate the spirit of the compromise between
the holding and mwoluve holding
States, without which tlie Constitution would never
have been adopted, by tolerating the discussion
of the subject of slavery in any form in its deliberation,
and whether a body designed to promote
the interests qf all the States can be made lite
theatre for endangering the security of any of
them, and the arena where they may be made the
objects of insult and reproach.
Resolved, It is the sense of this meeting that in
the event of the assembling of such a Convention,
after deciding on the existence and amount of tiie
peril, which may menace tho security and peace
of the Southern Stutes, they should take into account,
whether the recommendation of a call of a
Convention of all the States, in the form and manner
pointed out by the Constitution of the United
States be not expedient, that a friendly and sincere
appeal may be made to the non slave-holding
States to concur in all measures necessary to restore
harmony and concord to every portion of
IT_! - -
mis %j 111011,10 sustain the guarantees to which the
South is entitled under the compact of confedeby
cooperating in an anpjndmeijlto the Con- \
twn in any lorm wriatsoever in the Congress of the
Unitpd States, under the undeniable axiom, that
slavery is a subject which belongs to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the States in which this institution
exists. I11 one word, that 011 this and all other
questions of difference and irritation between the
States, in the language of a deceased and lamented
patriot, "we may have a fresh understanding
of the bargain," as the best means of perpetuating
the bargain itself.
Resolved, That the people of the Southern States
arc hereby earnestly requested to tnnke suitable
arrangements forthwith, that an election in each
Congressional District in their States respectively (
may be held on the Hist Monday in September 1
next, by the judges and managers of the elections 1
appointed by law, for the choice of a delegate
from each Congressional District to the said Con- <
volition of the Southern States at Richmond; and |
that a return of the election of the several delegates 1
he made to the Governors of the respective States 1
who arc respectfully requested to make proclamation
of delegation for each State so elected. ]
Resolved, That the people of the Southern 1
States he most strongly invoked to select lor this
high delegation, citizens eminent for wisdom, pa- i
triotism and ability, wiio would approach the high 1
matters submitted to their deliberation, with a <
cordial attachment to the Union of the States, as 1
formed by the labors, and sanctified by the blessings
of the "Father of our country," but with a
cj... ii lum slum iu#u no counsel irorn a dishonorable
fear to replace tlio interests and security of the
South, on a basis which constitutes the only formation
on which the Union could have been built, i
and the only one on which it can rest with safety ,
now and forever. j
Be it further Resolved, That this meeting lias .
witnessed with intense interest, and painful anx- j
iety, the agitation of the slave question in the <
General Conference of the Methodist Kjuscopal
Church, now convened in the City of New-York.
They have seen that a topic, which hitherto lias ,
excited the bad passions of men only in the orgies |
of fanaticism, or in the strife of factions in their ,
iUJui |...u
tfinsferredtot.be foot of that Throne which ought to }
We sacred to charity, peace, and good will among ,
Brethren of the same Faith. They have beheld {
with unutterable indignation, tlio humiliating fact (
of a Bishop of the State of Georgia, eminent for (
his piety, learning, ability and Christain virtues, put ,
in effect upon his trial as a culprit, for the ullodged |
sin of marrying a lady possessed of slaves, by which
it isinsultingly affirmed that a slaveholder is an unfit
Teacher of the word of God, and must submit, if j
tolerated as a member of tlio Church of Christ, to a I
subordinate station in the Ministry. A discrimination
which finds no warrant in the sacred oracles
of God, and which involves both insult and outrage
to the people of an entire section of tins Union.
Be it further Jtesolved, That if Bisliip Andrew
should be deposed from his Episcopal functions,
we earnestly invoke the clergy of the Methodist
Episcopal Church at the South, to take immediate
measures for their secession from a Conference i
which lias placed so gross ? stigma not only on
themselves hut on their respective flocks. An
insult which can admit of hut one remedy, in the
application of which they may be assured of the
warm sympathy, and unalterable support of the i
religious congregations of the whole Southern
States of every sect and denomination. i
Jtesolved, That we will pursue, totally irrc- i
spcctive of men and the jiending presidential election,
the objects announced in these resolutions.
That we have long seen, with loathing and disgust i
progress of n spirit of Man-worship through- <
cut the country, which, confined to no one party, |
if not timely repressed by the salutary condemnation
of an enlightened public opinion is likely to
degrade our people, as the voluntary instrument
of their own abasement, into1 something worse
than the slaves of an Oriental Despotism.
Resolved, That the chair he requested to appoint
a committee of five persons, who shall W u
standing committee for carrying these resglutioc*
into effect, and who shall cause their publication,
to be accompanied by a short but earnest j'ldcs**
to the Peoplyof l^io Southern ?tate?, forYU' 11 v in'
vukiiur tl|eir'adoption ef rh* Measures recornmvit/7
ed in thfl same, which we believe essential to the
peace, honor, and security of the country, and to
nn.- pivscrTnuun ui uuu union so inaispensatMe tp
itself to the happiness and safety of us all.
In conformity with the ahovc resolutions the
chair announced the following committee: Gen.
James Hamilton, S. Heydenfelt, S. C. Benton, C.
S. Reese, and Henry Moffat, Esus.
WM. DAVIS, Chairman.
J. Stro.no, Secretary.
Mcltum in Parto.?The following is General
Hamilton's reply to an invitation to attend a
Texas meeting in Macon county, Ala. It comprises
in the compass ofa nutshell, the great points
in the Texas question.
Owiciif.k Bend, June 2S, 1S44.
My Dear Sir:?1 most deeply regret I have
made an engagement for tomorrow I cannot violate
which precludes the possibility of my accepting
the invitation to the public meeting, to be held at
Auburn, in Macon county, to discuss, without distinction
of party, the A.unc*n,iai? Id&ft.
in the Post Office at Columbus, on Wednesday
evening last, a letter to the Committee of Ar
rungcments, communicating mv regret to tliem of
my inability to accept with which tliey likewise
honored me.
You will permit me, my dear sir, to say, that
the question itself involves one of those self evident
propositions, which requires no elaborate
course of reasoning, at least as far as the South is
concerned, to elucidate or enforce.
Thepropos itiov for the ^tilth is, shall we have
an ally on the weakest part of our whole frontier
in entire sympathy with our interests and institutions,
who shall have sworn allegiance to our flag;
or shall there be built up there in effect a foreign
power in hostility to iheinl A consequence inevitable,
from the rejection of the proposals of Texas
to become a member of our confederacy.
The proposition fur the whole nation is, shall the
supply of the navigation, trade, and manufactures
of Texas belong to us, under our confederate legislation,
ami belong to foreign nations, under discrimination
in l'avor of their tonnage and e* porta. |
The question for both is, shall these advantages
be perilled by del ly 1 In othcrwords, waS not immediate
annexation necessary to secure them? I
believe it was. You see I treat it as a question
settled under the unfortunate rejection of the
Treaty by the Senate of the United States, that
Texas is not to be annexed.
The letters of Mr. Cluy and Mr. Van Baren
so entirely fortified the pretensions of Mexico, (for
they are mere pretensions,) and so far justified the
interference of foreign nations, that it is now probably
impracticable, except through the immediate
action of the Southern States, speaking in a
language not to be misunderstood, through a convention
of them all. But from the unhappy divisions
among ourselves, this, I presume, is just as
impossible as any human event can well be, altho'
the organ of a public meeting in this county I felt
it my duty to submit such a proposition. No, my
good sir, these two then candidates for the Presidency,
one of them still abiding in the field have
argued the question so thoroughly against their
wn country.^nd sp
triovably,) that under a time-serving submission
of a majority of the Senate of the United Stnles,
the South has probably lost forever, an impregnable
boundnrv, and a staunch ally in the hour of
danger and difficulty, and the whole Union one of
the most productive and copious theatres for our
commerce, navigation und manufactures in the
whole world.
As to the northern Senators, who have gone
against us, we must leave them to the grateful
garlands with which they will be crowned by the
Abolitionists of their own country. They have
certainly labored most successfully in the vocation
of our worst enemies. But what shall we say to
the Senators of the South, who from no other mn
live than to sustain Mr. Clay, and to prostrate Mr.
Tyler and Mr. Calhoun, have sacrificed the interests
of their own States, by fixing us forever in a
hop eless, degraded and colonial minority? Snch
an obedient Senate has certainly not sat since the
lime of the Emperor Coiumodus.
I must, confess I take a very gloomy view of
public affairs. The South is divided, prostrate,
md undone, and prostrate and undone because
die is divided. There is no invocation among us
nifliciently powerful to recall the "buried wartike
and the wise," and the living seem to have no
ither fate but to drink deeply of the waters of bitterness
and humiliation. I remain, &c.
J. HAMILTON.
Southern Convention.?At a meeting of the
-itizens of Russell county, Alabama, on the 8th of
I iino, a preamble and resolutions were offered by
Sen. James Hamilton, and adopted without a disuniting
voice?in which it is proposed that "a
Convention oflhe Southern States shall assemble
it Richmond, Va., on the third Monday in October,
to take into consideration the situation of the
"Southern States in reference to the institution of
lornestic slavery existing among them; there
almly and dispassionately to deliberate, whether,
imler the compact of Union, the Congress of the
United States have a right to violate the spirit of

my form in its deliberations, and whether a body
lesigned to promote the interests of all the States
;a? he made the theatre for endangering the secit ity
f)f any of them, and the arena where they may
w made the object of insult and reproval."
Cutting.?At a political meeting in Mississippi,
the coon orator perorated with a flaming dec*
. ration that his principles were invulnerable as
'lie sevenfold shield of Ajax Telarnon. Henry S.
Foote, in reply observed :?"The gentleman says
be carries with him the shield of Ajax for defence;
?now, fellow citizens, in some respects this is
true, and in others it is not. I will respectfully
point out wherein that gentleman's shield differs
from the classic one he has assumed. In one res
pect, they are alike, hoth being made of cow hides,
hut they essentially differ in the manner in which
they were borne. Ajnx carried his upon his breast,.
whereas Mr. carries his upon his hack.?'
But he says it is a sevenfold shield of defence.
Well, part of this is true. He was cowhided at
Vicksburg, that's one,?he was cowhided at Jackson,
that's two,?and at Madison, that's three.?
Now having pointed out three of the cow hidos, 1
call upon the generosity of the gentleman for the
remaining four to make up his sevenfold."
"This is a very impartial country for justice,"
said Sam. "There ai'nt a magistrate going as
don't commit hiiriself twice as often as he does other
people !" , .

MEETING IN RUSSELL COUNTY, ALABAMA.
Our readers will find the proceedings of this
meeting in another column of our paper. We recommend
at least a perusal of the resolutions and
the accompanying address.
In these times of threatening and of danger, it is
certainly the ctbty of all to acquaint themselves, as
fur as may be practicable, with the topics of excitement,
and to form an "pinion, which they may (

DEATH OF THK MORMON PROPHET.
Tlx events which led to und succeeded the
L?a?ruct(<^\>ji thr l^ih' uUiri'o, of the newspaper
^ <>f|i< e oTfh.t " Njjuftfas Rjdpudr
>r," by order of Joe Smith hod his CounitJT together
With the declaration of n artial law and
ufoption of other arbitrary tneasuf es by the Predict
in connection with dint unlawful act, so in
:eused u. portion of the people ot Illinois against
he Mormons and the Mormons against thetn, that
i flairs in that quarter have ever since presented an
ispect more than usually threatened to the pub-io
peace. The latest point of contest appears to
lave been concerning the arrest of the persons
who by Smith's order, had destroyed the press?
he officers who were sent from \Varsaw for that
mrpose having either been resisted, or Smith insisting
on having the prisoners taken before his
)\v*i Court on writ of habeas corpus, and there discharged,
as ha?l been before done in others. Such
aroceedings were not calculated to restore quiet ;
:he excitement increased, threats of violence by
aoth parties followed, and each of them prepared
Tor defence?the faithful Mormons flocking to
Nuuvoo, their chief city, and their adversaries congregating
at Carthage and Warsaw". In the mean
time the Governor of the State deemed it neces(#rv
to interpone. Hi? dc?patchf?d a messenger IS
Smith demanding the surrender of the State urms
at Nauvoo, and requiring hitn and his Council to
appear forthwith and explain their conduct. After
some delay they surrendered themselves on
the evening of the 24th ultimo, and were all arrested
tho next morning for the destruction of the
Expositor, and Smith also on a warrant for treason
against the State. We know not what occurred
on the 29th, but Smith and two of his followers
lost their lives the next day, as will be seen by
Lhe following, copied from an extra of tho Quincy
Herald of the 2Sth :
"It appears that Joe and Hiram Smith, and n
number of other Mormon leaders, were in jail at
Uarthago, confined on certain offences against the
laws oi the State. Tho Carthage Grays, a volunteer
company, were placed as a guard around the
jail. About six o'clock on the evening of the
27th, an attempt was made by the Mormons on
the outside to rescue the prisoners from the custody
of the guard. A youth about nineteen years
of age, (a Mormon) began the affray by shooting
the sentinel at the door, wounding him severely
in the shoulder. Simultaneously with tho attempt,
the Mormons on the inside of the jail; including
the Smiths, presented pistols through the windows
and doors of the jail, and " fired upon the guard
without, wounding, it is supposed, mortally, four
of the old citizens of Hancock. It is unnecessary
to say that this bloodthirsty attempt on the part ol
the Mormons was the signal for certain and sure
vengeance. The lives of Joe Smith and his brother
Hiram, and Richards, Joe Smith's Secretary,
were (juickly taken, and we believe no others.?
Carthage was filled with Mormons previous to
the affray. The Mormons appeared to be collecting
around the jail for the purpose of attempting
the rescue of their leader.
"Here our intelligence ends. What took place

left for Nauvoo to carry the news of the death
of the Prophef. On yesterday Gov. Ford left
Carthage with ahout 120 soldiers for the purpose
of taking possession of the 'Nauvoo Legion' and
their arms. They arrived at Nauvoo ahout noon,
.Cs\r tiua
Abour2000 men with arms immediately responded
to the call. These troops, were inimediately
Iiut under the command of Col. Singleton, ol
drown county, who accompanied Gov. Ford.to
Nauvoo.
"The Governor, finding all quiet, left Nauvoo
about 5 o'clock, P. M. with a company of 60 men,
for the purpose of encamping about seven miles
from the city. It is feared that the Mormons o(
Nauvoo will be so exasperated as to exterminate
the Governor and his lorce.
"Our citizens were aroused this morning by the
ringing of bells and a cull to arms. Our three independentcompaniesare
already in rnarchingordcr.
Major Flood has ordered out the militia of his regiment,
and the steamer Boreas is waiting to convey
thetn to the scene of action.
"There is no knowing where this dreadful affair
will end. Many have expressed fears that our city
is in dantrer. because mmt of tl>?? W?* ?<? ?? r..~.:i ?
t, . ?
have taken refuge here, but we are too far from
the scene of action.
"Messengers have just left for Hannibal and the
towns below for the purpose of arousing the Missourinns.
The excitement in our city i* intense,
and the anxiety to hear the fate of Gov. Ford and
his men very great.
"It is also feared that both Carthage and Warsaw
have been burned by the Mormons, as threats of
that kind have been made. The women and children
of the latter place have been taken to places
of safety. A portion of them came down here on
the Boreas this morning. The German Guards
and Rifle Company are now assembling, as well as
a portion of the militia, for the purpose of inarching
to the scene of action."
Other accounts say that the news of Smith's
(lite had not reached Nauvoo at daylight of the
28th, ami hence it is inferred that Gov. Ford, who
was encamped a few miles hack of the city, had intercepted
the messengers from Carthage. At
Warsaw all was excitement. The women and
children were all removed, and an immediate attack
was expected from the Mormons.
Later.?The Cincinnati Atlas, of Jytjr-1, contains
intelligence from Nauvoo up o'clock on
he evening of the 28th June. We copy the following
from that paper:
The steamer Mendota, at St. Louis, left Nauvoo
r>n Friday at four o'clock. Capt. Riley says he
stopped at Nauvoo several hours, and talked with
a number of the Mormons ; and that while there a
body of Mormons came in, l?earing the dead bodies
of Joe nnd Hiram Smith. Mr. Phelps was not
killed, hut was in Nauvoo when the Mendota left,
making a speech to the Mormons, and advising
them to peace. Richards was not injured?no
Mormons heing killed except Joe and Hiram
Smith. The Mormons all express a determination
to keep the peace, and not to resort to arms except
in necessary defence.

had arms while others had nothing to defend
themselves, immediately betook themselves to the
mountains. After soveral brushes with the Mexican
troops, in which several of his men were either
killed or tuken prisoners, Sentmanat was fi

Jalpa, near Tobftsco, on the ISth ult., after the
consolations of religion were admirtistered to hifta.

but in which wisdom had no counsel. That the
Mexican authorities were justifiable in putting to
death the leader we are not prepared to dispute;
hut nothing can palliate the horrible mutilations
committed upon his person after his life had paid
the forfeit of his revolutionary attempt. What
became of the vessel which transported Sentmannt,

to learn."
Pensacola, July 4, 1844.
To thf Editors of the Herald Sf Tribune:
Gentlemen?The U. S. ship Vincennes, Captain
F. Buchanan, arrived here to-day, from a
cruise on the const of Texas and Mexico. Sho ?
brings important despatches from Commodore
Conner, Commander-in-Chief of the "Home
Squadron," and Mr. Green, our Charge des Affuires
at Mexico, which have Injen forwarded by
mail. The Vinccnnes sailed from Vera Cruz on
the 25th June, and left at anchor off that port, the
U. S. Frigate Potomac, Capt. Newell, (Flag Ship
of the Home Squadron,) and the U. S. brig Somers,
Commander Gerry, also tho U.S. Revenue Cutter
Woodbury, Capt. Foster.
Papers to the 20th of June have been received
from the city of Mexico. They contain Santa Ajjna's
letter to his Minister of Foreign Relations,
written after the interview which he had with Mr.
G. L. Thompson, the recent special agent of tho
United Stales to Mexico, also a long correspondence
between Mr. llocanngrc, the Mexican dsliniator
of Foreign Relations, and Mr. Green, our
Charge do Affuirs, on the subject of the annexation
of Texas to the United States.
The views and intent ions of Mexico relative to
Texas may be inferred from Santa Anna's lettor,
of which the following is jm extract: "The President
of the United States, in my opinion, has not
acted very prqperly in treating u? the annexation
s,of 'Jfexos witV^ita actual ix>ssea4orsr because t^H ^
? majority of these being but a portion of the Ainericun
community, although with the name of Texinns,
have no right to enter into Treaty of a Terri1
tory which does not belong to them. That Mexh
co being resolved to sustain her rights without evfcr,
1 y ielding tlicm, because she considers tb#?m
. . ?r?*"
thnablc, thinks the proposition made on the part of
i the Americuns to he inadmissible, and renounces
all idea of ceding her territory. That Mexico is
resolved again to undertake .vigorously the campaign
against Texas, for which she holds in readiness
a large army, with all the necessary resources,
which the peace she had bitterly enjoyed, and
the general prosperity of the country, have enabled
her to obtain. That if she bus not proceeded
to open the campaign during the present year it is
because she bus been awaiting the result of the
armistice agreed upon, in order to treat of the termination
of the actual war. That if the United
States desire in good faith to arrest the disorder
which exists there so much to their prejudice,
their best plan is to induce Texas to recognize tho
sovereignty of Mexico, disposed as she is to moke,
every concession which situation, religion, customs,
&c., may require, but that in no manner will
she consent to dismember her territory; rather will
she carry the war to any extreme which mav.be
necessary to sustain her rights; and that as nations
do not die, the right of reconquering that territory
shall remain to our children and our grand children.
That this is the opinion of the Government
and of the Mexican* "
Tlic Mexican Congress have refused to grant
Santa Anna the additional thirty thousand men
and four millions of dollnrs which he required for
the invasion of Texas, Mexico has now a force of
thirty-six thousand men. The Congress has intimated
to the President that he can tuke f'om this
body the number asked for, provided he call into
active service a corresponding number of the "national
militin," and that it will allow him one million
of dollars if ho can raise lka?. amount of money
without forcing a foan. This proposition does not
suit (lie views of Santa Anna, and unless he can
carry out his original plun his invasion of Texas
will In: abandoned at least for the present.
Gen. Reyes has been appointed Minister of
War und Marine in the stead of Gen. Tornell; Generul
Coinez de la Cortina to the head of the War
Bureau, and Gen. Canalizo chosen commander of
the nrmy against Texas. ,

There were no French vessels of war at Vera
