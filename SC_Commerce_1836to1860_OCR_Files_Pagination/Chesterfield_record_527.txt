cultivatiomofcokn, th'
The difference of opinion among far* co
mere as to the best mode of cultivating T?
corn, induced me some years ago, to give
some attention to the subject. The rea- ?1
eons assigned, and the experience of many *7
kii.l .irri^iilli?ria^i in fnvfir nf ths I
VI l/vn? v? ?ttv I
yitem of level cultivation have convinced 161
- me t at our present mode is not the best,
* and that it is susceptible of % decided Jv
change for the better. f
I am perfectly aware, that to question *r
the propriety of the exclusive use of the 0
plough in the cultivation of corn will be *n
laughed, at, and that to intimate that the 0UI
ridging of a corn field is not the most cer.
tain mode of ensuring a good crop will be ?
denounced as mere " book farming " and *
hence entitled to no respect ^
The preseot mode of cultivation is gen*
orally, to burn off the stalks and stubble rei
that may be upon the ground?to break as
?p with a shallow furrow?plant the corn ru
without rolling or harrowing the ground
?then harrewing the corn while small, !
and then by plougeing a? often as may 1
be deemed necessary. In ploughing the 1
corn, the prevailing and almost universal *
vale is, to plough dose to the corn hills. 0
to cut the fibres of the roots so as to in- Jj?,'
. crease and strengthen the stalk t, as yov c
cut the roofs of trees in an orchard by
ploughing, to make the trees grow vigor- - *
omslp / //?to. throw the earth high up on *?r
the stalks, and to fay by the crop by In
ploughing three or four furrows between ra!
the rows, that the pound may be well
ridged, so as to retain the moisture about f fe
the hills of corn// ?,
The system of culture, that I believe # i
is sustainable by reason and experience, crc
is the opposite of all this.
1.?If the ground intended to be culti. .
13 I
rated in corn has a sod upon it it should
be broken up in the fall or winter precee. 1111
ding, if the weather is suitable; if not, it *.n
hould be ploughed in February, or at *,x
least in the first week of March. If not
level it sliould be rolled, and if not mellow 0
it should be harrowed before planting, ^
^ 2.?If stubble or corn ground, no stub- ^
ble nor stalks should be burned or removed
CO
unless taken to the manure pile?should .
be ploughed six inches deep, and if not 1
mellow should be harrowed. V
3.?While small, the corn should he "
harrowed and the ground should be after- Jjjj
wards kept mellow and loose by the re- ^
peated use of the cultivator. ,
4.?On sod ground & plough should (
never be used in the cultivation of corn. .
^ 5.?On other ground the plough should "
never be used, after the roots have exten- '
ded any distance from the hills, and at no P f
time unless indispensably necessary to
prevent the ground from baking. -ri
0. The fibres or small roots of the corn r0<
should not be cut; the cutting off every
fibre deprives the stalk of & part of its
nourishment. jj*
7- The earth should not be thrown
high up on the hills, as it induces the rs
throwing out of additional spur roots. A B(1
very slight portion of mould may be put rc
round the hill. _
8. The ground in the cultivation of
corn should be kept as level as possible, ac
to permit the roots to extend in every directi
on and to retain moisture. Ridging, ?
cuts the roots?prevents the extension e
of the surfice of the roots beyond the ul
middle of the rows?drains the water
from the hills?exposes more surface to Cl1
the action of the sun, and is therefore injuriotis
to a crop in a dry season. "
My own limited observation and ex- P'
peri nee, satisfy me of the correctness of ,
the above rules to be observed, in the .
cultivation of corn, and I now offer the *
pinions of the ablest and most practical
farmers in the United States to sustain .
the positions I have assumed. ?
* 1 D I L _ P.. J P 18

A thorough knowledge of the science of
^ agriculture?for general intelligence? CJ
practical experience?and for a most ex- P
tensive knowledge and familiariiy with
the modes adopted by our agriculturists, Pr
was unequalled by any man in the United &1
8tates, in speaking of the cultivation of
this crop, expresses the following opinions:
** The after culture consists in keaping
the soil loose and free from weeds, which
is ordinarily accomplished by two dress- *?
ings, and in thinning the plants, which 831
Utter may be done the first hoeing, or
partially omitted till the last. The prac- Wl
tice of plougbihg among corn, and of ^
making large hills,-U justly getting into D3
disrepute : for tbe plough bruises and cuts Iz
the roots of the plaats, turos up the sod N<
id manure to waste, and renders the 1
op more liable to suffer by dronght. a
be nfot dressing should be performod as t
on as the size of the plants will permit, *
id the best implement to precede the t
e is a corn harrow, adapted to the width 1
the rows, which every farmer can c
ike. This will destroy most of the i
wds and pulverize the soil. The sec- r
d hoeing should be performed before i
as soon as the tassels appear, and may proceeded
by the corn.harrow, or a
allow furrow of the plough, or what is e
tter than either, by the cultivator. A ?
ghf (earthing is benefiriol, proVidid the
rth is scraped from the surface, and the r
i and manure not exposed. It will he ft
ind beneficial to run the harrow or cut- t
ator a third, and even a fourth time be. I<
een the rows, to destroy weeds and i
?en the surface, particularly if the sea p
i is dry." t
"Some entertain a mistaken notion, t
it it is prejudicial to stir the soil among v
rn in dry weather, and others, that c
teds serve to prevent the evaporation t
moisture by a hot sun. The reverse t
these opinions is true. The exhaustion t
moisture by a plant is in the ratio of n
i surface of its leaves and stalks pre- (t
ited to the sun and air." , u
44 Indian coax.?There is no crop p
tich habit has rendered more inispensa- r
> to the wants of our families and our
ms than this. The late John Taylor, '
Virginia, termed it our 4 meat, meal t
d manure/ Holding this high rank in b
r farm economy, it is a subject of mo- e
nt to adopt the best mode of culture, h
many districts are shy in producing t
teat, and as this crop is seriously threa- t
ted by tbe new (to us) wheat insect, it e
comes more a matter of solicitude to ider
our corn crops productive. But k
this grain demands more labor in its t
fture than other grain crops, so it i? c
>re important, on the score of profit J
it it should be well managed ; for if
rty bushels an acre be considered only
emuneration for the labor bestowed on
5 crop?all that the product falls short p
this must be a loss?and all that it ex- |
eds. a nett gain on the cultivation P
le first consideration in regard to the ^
rn crop, is to give it a dry mellow soil;
i second, that this soil be rich, fat or ,
tile: and the third, that the seed be B
icly put in and the crop well taken a
>e of. Neither wet grounds, nor stiff c
vs, nor poor grounds, will repay by
)ir product, the labor required on a crop d
corn. He who has no other but these, ,
>uld not attempt tc raise it as a field 0
>p. He had better bestow his labor ?
on other objects, and busy his corn, c
e think the best prrparn^oji for corn
a clover ley, well clovered with long r
inure from the barn-yard, will ploughed
d well harrowed. It is better to give
ty loads of dung to three acres than to
1. upon the ordinary lands in our neigh- g
rhood. The difference in product will c
t make up for the difference in labor,
>rn can hardly be dunged too high. 1
hat we have to recommend, that is not 1
mmon in the culture of this crop, is, .
it double the usual quantity of seed be
plied?the number of plants to be re- (
ced at the weeding?iiQ order to insure
eeor four stalks in each hill;?the* I
s roots be not broken, nor the manure 4
rown to the surface by the plough, but
it the harrow and cultivator be substited
for, it which will sufficiently mel- |
v the surface and destroy weeds, and 1
it the hills be but slightly earthed. By f
mghingand hilling we conceive the '
inure is wasted, the roots broken and 1
uised, and limited in their range for ,
>d, the crop more exposed to injury J
>m drought, and the labor increased." I
In speaking of the plough in the eulation
of corn he again thus remarks?
We do not use it. We think its
e prejudicial in breaking the
>ots and in limiting their range
|r nutriment."
Mr. James M. Sutton, of St. George
elawnre, who raised uoon seventy-nine
:rcs 6.264 bushels of corn, and who
ves an accurate and detailed account
the condition and cultivation of each
dd makes this remark in relation to the
e of the plough :
" In order to test the advantage of the
iltlvator over the plough, for tilling
rn, he had five rows in his field that
t lapped the furrow to, with a plough,
evious to going over it the last time with
e cultivator. He soon discovered that
e growth of these five rows fell short, in
ught, of those adjacent, and yielded one'th
less corn. 1
" There is no doubt but the true mode
tilling corn, especially where ?od ground
used is to plough deep, and use nothing j
it the fallow and flake harrow for its
dtivation. By not disturbing the sod
oughed down, it remains there as a re. i
rvoir of moisture, and an exhilarating <
inciple throughout the season, to the 1
owth of the corn." I
james m. suttojf. j
Upon Mr. Sutton's report of his crop, j
idge Buel adds the following :
Note.?The management which led I
the extraordinary product of corn, i
ould be deeply impressed upon the mind \
' every corn grower. I. The ground '
as well dunged with long manure; 2. 1
was planted on a grass ley, with one
cep ploughing; 3. It was well pulver. ,
ed with the harrow; 4. the plough was <

lilled, but the cultivator only used; 5. the
iod was not disturbed, nor the manure!'
urned to the surface; And 8, the corn |
VES CUT AT THE GEOUND when it WAS fit
o top. These are the points which we
?ave repeatedly urged in treating of the
sulture of this <^op; and their correctness
9 put beyond question by this notable
esult, The value of time and marl are
rell illustrated in the second experiment
?conductor."
Mr. Charles H. Tomlinson, of Sehen?
ctady, New York, in giving an account'
This experience, say*: * j * * ?
* The two lent yearn corn hai been
aised in the following manner, on the
ifoha wk Flats, near this city. If in grass,
he laod is ploughed and well harrowed,
engthwise of the furrow, without disturb,
ng the sward. The ground is then pre.
tared for planting, by being marked out
wo and a half feet one way and three
eet the other. The last season, the held
ras rolled alter being planted, with evilent
benefit, as it made it level. When
he corn is three inches high, the cultiva
or is passed through both ways 5 and
wice afterwards it is uned in the same
nanner; no hills are made, but the
ground is kept level. Neither hand.hoe,
tor plough are us. d, after the corn is
ilanted. Fields manured with coarse
nanure have been illed in the
ame manner. Corn tilled in this
ray is as clean of weeds, as when
illed in the usual way: it is no more lia*
tie to be blown down, and t:he produce is
qually good. It saves a great deal of
lard labor, which is an exjiensive item in
he usual culture of corn. Last October,
ea rods were iteasured out, in two difTrent
places, in a corn field, on grass
?the one yielding ten, the other nine,
tushels of ears. In one corn-field, after
he last dre?s:ng in Julv, timothy and
ilnver se?-d wereswn, ind in the fall th
irass appeared to have taken at well at it
ias done in adjoining fields where it had been
own with oats."
Upon which Judge Buel again remarks:
* All or nearly*ll;tfie accounts we have
luhlished of grnat|prudtiett of Indian enrn a[ree
in two particulars, vis; in not using the .
ilough in the culure, and in not earthing, or
iut very slightly, the Stills. These results go
o demonstrate, that the entire roots ara egential
to the vigor of the eiops and to enable
hem to perform their functions at nature do.
igneii, must be netr the wirfare. If the ft to La
re severed with the plough, in dressing the
rop, the pianta are deprived of a portion of
heit nourishment; and if they are buried
eep by hilling, I he plant i;? part ially exhaua.
ed in throwing out a new s. t near the eur.
ace, where ai-?ne they ran perform all theit
iffices. There in another material advantage
n this mode of cultivating the corn crop?it
ares a vast deal oI manual labor."
The pror.eediqg cmsirleratinn* justify u> in
tco'.nmeiding, that in the management 01
he Indian corn crop, the following rulea he
?h~ervt'(] or at least partially, so farastoteet
heir correctness :
I. That the corn harrow aid cu:tivatnr be
ubitiluted for the plough in the culture of the
:rop.
2 That the pianta not hilled, or bu*
lightly eo?this not to prevent the toil being
jftenstirred and kept clean, and,
3. That in harvesting, the crop be cut at
he ground as soon aa the grain is glazed.
Again, in reference to the iv?tern of level
cultivation of corn; Judge Bui remarks;
M The experience of ?he last t wo years has
>een sufficient to admonish un, that without
lue precaution, our crops of Indian cora will
tot pay for the labor bestowed cub the cu ture;

* ArTER ccLTOTE ?In this the plough
ihould not be used if the corn harrow and
cultivator can be had, and if used, should not
ae suffered to penetrate the eoi:l more tkan
wo or three inches. The plough tears the
oots, turns up and wastes the manure, and in.
creases the injuries of drought The main
ibjec is to extirpate weeds, and to keep the
turface nHIo* anu open, that the heat, air
ami inosture may exert belter their kind in.

As an evidence of the practical results of
this mode of cultivating corn, I give you in
addition, the statements of two other farmers
of their tuode, and of the products of their
land.

Can she Spin.
This question was asked by King Jame:
1st when a \oung girl was presented t<
him, and the person who introduced he
boasted of her proficiency in the ancien
languages. "I can assure your Majesty,1
said he, "that she can both speak an<
write Latin, Greek and Hebrew."?
These are rare attainments for a dam
sel," said Jame, "but pray tell me, cat
she spin?"
i Many of the young lahies of the pres
ent day can boast of their skill in th<
fine arts and polite accomplishments, 11
music, painting and dancing, hut cat
they spin? or what is more appropriat<
to the times and. modorn improvement
in labor-saving machinery, it may b<
asked, can they perform the domestic du
ties of a wife? do they understand th<
management of household affairs? An
they capable of superintending in ajudi
riotis, prudent and economical manner
the concerns of a family ?
A young lady may be learned in th<
ancient and modern languages, may hav<
made extraordinary proficiency in ever}
branch of literature; this is all very wel
and very creditable, and to a certaii
class of the community, who are no
obliged, as was Saint Pau1, "to labor witl
their own haods," is all that if absolutely
requisite, but to a much larger portioi
of fhe community, it is of far greate
.
consequence to know whether they can

mechanic, or a merchant, or one of any
other class of people who depend upon
their oifrn industry and exertions* if he
marriea a wife, to have one who knows

duties, than one whose, knowledge does
not extend beyond a proficiency in literature
and the fine arts.

s Clay Mixture ox sandy lands.?a
correspondent of the Western Farmer,
e gives the following as his experience oi
r the value of mixed clay with sandy soil:
* Several years since, when a resident ol
New England I purchased a piece of drj
sandy land, denominated there, **pin?

for as much as a barrel of flour, and can
he more easily produced.

an acre to produce a barrel of flour, whilst
the same amount of land will produce
twelve pounds of silk, as proven by the
Rev. D W McLean, of New Jersey, and
many others.
5. Because one pound of lilk, Worth
96, can be taken to market lit as little
expense as a pound of flour,.worth four

silk is performed in six weeks, whim
any other article of produce requires six

DESTRUCTION OF CATERPILLARS.
* S
I Our readers are reminded that this
. worm should be attended to in season,
and when this is done, the labor of extirpation
will be trifling. Close attention
to clear the limbs for one or two years
will entirely rid an orchard of tbe tiuisr
ance. One easy mode of destruction is
to apply strong soap suds to the nest?if
the tree is larga a swab tied to the end of
a pole wilt accomplish tbe purpose effectually.
Suds which have been used by the
wash woman are as good as any, and by
rubbing a swab on the nest-natter it has
been dipped into the suds?the worms are
quickly destroyed.?Maine Cultivator.
