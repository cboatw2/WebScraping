THE ACCEPTED PRAYER.
All is bc?t, though we oft doubt
What tho unsearchable dispose
Of highest wisdom brings about
And ever best found in tho closo.
Milton.
14Good morning, Mr. how is
your father?" said 1 us a tall, handsome
looking youth rode on horseback up to
ine House 1 resided in. 1 had been anxiously
expecting hint? and the question
was spoken in the soft accent of kind regard
and touched the heart of the youth,
veil to tears.
"No better?never will be I am afraid;
do go over and comfort my mother, she is
distracted with grief, my sister is a sorry
comforter. They have sent for you." It
was but a short mile, and without any farther
conversation, I accepted the invitation
and soon reached the house of mourning.
In the time of the war, it was a
a hous3 formerly occupied by Cornwallis
as a fort. It was curiously formed.?
Made of logs, of very heavy timber, destitute
of windows, and one cnornions
chimney occupied the entire side. Many
a time have 1 seen the good Dutchman
smoke his pipe in one corner, and in the
opposite corner his vrow imitate his example.
They were once poor, but by
their honest industry had accumulated a
competency. Their plantation was well
stocked with cattle, and their house furnished
better than the most of their neigh1
* "
dots 01 meir grade in society. They had
toiled together in the house and field and
their interests were inseparable. Such
deep affection I never observed, even in
the higher walks of life, and I am tempted
to believe that the polish, the improved
mental acquirement is, after all, no acquisition
to the purity of deep affection.
Sickness had laid prostrate the strength
and reason of the old man, and the following
night was the crisis of the disease.
The physician gave 110 hopes and I found
Mrs. D ? exhausted with grief. At the
sight of my approach, she broke out in aj
deeper wailing. I bade her trust in the
mo*'/* ? ' h? ^1!/v 1 1 *
wi wiu gntr ui niu, ouue ncr nope j
that her husband would be restored to her,
and above all, to resign every desire to
liis Almighty will.
"Accuse me not of selfishness/' said
she clasping her hands in agony. "It is
for my son I grieve. Who will be his
guide when his father is dead? Witness
my offering." And she fell on her knees
in the attitude of prayer. " As Abraham
offered his pure boy for a sacrifice, so do
I, oh, my God! to save tli3 soul of my
child. Accept this frail body in lieu of.
his father; if death is decreed to visit us,j
let me be the victim." She arose comforted,
for she believed, what the heart in
the bitterness of its agony did require;,
would be accomplished^. And strange to
relate, the father recovered?lived to,
watch, to administer the prescriptions left
the
wife?but
mental malady, and who ran
^ administer to a mind diseased? JS!m was
convinced she was a victim, and she wn?
resigned that her prayer had met acceptance.
A week from the day I visited \Tr.!
, I was called to the house of the civ- i
ing wife. The summons was so urgent1
that I rode on horseback, but to my great J
disappointment, the vital spark had (led. j
I found her husband sitting in his corner
smoking as usual, and the deep grief pictured
on his visage was heart-rending to
behold. I sought the daughter. Sue was
n p
a girl I loved for her affectionate heart.
I found her immersed in grief. The heart
of woman is peculiarly adapted to sorrow;
not so with man, he is supported by a
phisolophy which forbids him to yield to
grief. Association is the great bond that
keeps affection constant; without it memory
is but a poor substitute. The daughter
knew that she had lost a friend that never
could be replaced, a daily adviser and
comforter The son for whom this great
sacrifice had been made was a wayward
boy and given to intemperance, and it
Wft this fear, bereft of his father's care,
that caused Mrs. D. s to express so
much in favor of her boy. She did not
consider the power" of female influence to
win the straying heart?the battle is not
always awarded to the strong?the timid
mother relied on the effect of example,
and the stern precept of his father, to reclaim
him. Alas! was it ever known to
profit?
The burial day came?I bad taken the
household charge and endeavored to conduct
every thing I had observed Mrs. D,
to perform.

room where poor Mrs. D. was 1 ;>i<l, waf
evidently expressed on one of her ser
vant's countenance; and after great per
suasion to tell me how I was in fault, she
exclaimed. "You quality have youi
fashions, and we have ours, if you wil
unlock the big chest and give me tin
towels and sheets I will arrange thing:
better." To gratify so simple a request
atkvn th*? ?l<>nirod nrtieles in her charge
with which after proem ing nails and fork*
she decorated the death apartment ii
white drapery. It was a singular mode
but the impression it produced on m]
feelings sanctioned the propriety of thi
fashion' The funeral was conducted will
solemnity. The neighbors attended will
sorrowful countenances. Mrs. D. wo
kind to the poor and they mourned thei
benefactress. She was laid in Iter grav
watered by the tears of her household.
Twelve ycarsclapscd! what a filling u
of time! One year discovers the vicissitudes
of life, what then must be the revolution
of twelve bring forth? I became
a wamlerer over the watery deep, visited
strange places, experienced many vicissitudes
allotted to all mortals, and by the
freak of destiny once more returned to
the scenes of my childhood. Memory
still retained a green spot for the family
ot the good Dutchman. The next morning
after my arrival at the village where
1 sojourned, 1 ordered my horse and rode
to his plantation. The distance was about
four miles, and as I again retraced the
scenes of childhood I had ample leisure
to observe the inroads of time. The
forest of majestic oak and pine had been
cut down by the woodman, and fields of
grain hod usurped their place?some few
i it ?i - 1 * ' - - 1 *
ii vt-s nuu iivi*ii uuuiveu in rviiiiiiii, nun uisplaycd
their gnarled and rotten branches,
and hollow trunks, looking like skeletons
of death. Decay was written on all familiar
things. The old school house had
rotted down, and saplings were growing
lip like youth that usurps the place ol
age. The teacher of that rude abode,
where was he? Decay had. long fastened
her fingers upon his lordly visage, and he
was gone' to his long home. The road
that was heretofore safe and pleasant fo
the traveller, had now changed into washed
gulleys and broken hills.
As I journeyed 011 the house of the
good Dutchman came to view. The same
antiquated dwelling house and out-buildings,
but they retained their uniform
neatness and preservation- It appeared
as if old time had stood still, and 1 was
again the playful favorite of the inmates
of this abode* The otvngr was at home
and I received the same warm welcome as
of yore. The prayer had been accepted,
the mother was taken, ami the father left;
but had the end desired met the accomplishment?
My inquiries brought out the
following tale from the lips of 1I10 bereaved
father. " I am alone," said he,
' none to greet yon hut myself. My
daughter has married and gone 10 the far
West, and my son is dead! The grave has
closed over the remains of owe who lived
a life of impiety and given to debasing
intemperance. The death of his mother
caused a suspension in his 'ucked career
[ for a season, but as time wore on, he b"camc
accustomed to his bereavement, and
his heart became scared, and dried up
Mite the sea-weed exposed to n summer's
sun. My admonitions were unheeded,
and he died the death of a drunkard. 1
mourned not?I rejoiced; the relief it
gave me cannot be express-fed. The task
of guiding and warning him. was wearing
my own life away, ami the sacrifice mv
beloved wife, had made was ever present;
to my imagination. I had not the gift of I
persuasive power, my admonition oli'lcd!
into reproaches. I a now eonvinc. d if ;

through hto alloction to pray for death
and spare my agency to guide arid win

I have sinned too much in prizing the I
gift, from heaven so as to make me forgetful
of the Great Giver. It was a sod
night lie was brought home to die! I had
not seen him for weeks and knew not his
dwelling place. My eyes were strained
to almost blinbness in watching for him
through the day, and ears ached in listening
till mid-night for his step. When he
dr> did rr?mn home I was comforted to
know that he was not committing some
evil deed or suicide. Rut this comfort had
long left me and I was a prey to devouring
suspense. I could hear how he did
congregate with beings of debasing mould,
and I dreaded evil from such companionship.

TREASURY DEPARTMENT, ) \
February 12, 1838. )
Dear Sir?In reply to your enquiries
of this date, respecting the situation of
the financial department of the government,
over which 1 preside, in which you
offer some apology for giving me so much
trouble. I can assure you sir, that so far
from considering it a trouble, that it affords
me infinite pleasure to have an opportunity
through your laudable inquiries
to lay before the public, a fair statement
of the situation of the financial department.
This is a duty which, as a public
officer, I feel^bnund to perform, and do it
the more willingly, inasmuch as the reports
from my department, which have
been regularly and faithfully made to each
session of the general congress, have by
that body been neglected and not laid before
the people as was expected by me.?
I I nve a right to expect that the representatives
of the people would not only
know, but perform their dutv towards
their constituents. In this however, I am j
sorry to say I have been entirely disap-j
pointed.
Why that body have so acted and nc- j
llected to give to the people that information
which is ever sought with avidity, I \
am entirely unprepared to say. Of one !
thing however I am satisfied, that the fault ;
has not been mine. Many difficulties
must necessarily be overcome before the
financial department of a new government
like ours, can be property systematized
and settled down upon anything like
a 'air basis I flatter myself however,
that the time is not far distant when this
department will be enabled to make a
shewing that will certainly be considered
as an anomaly in the history of civilized
nations.
You will find, that in the estimate which
nllnws, the expenditures of the govern-*'

It is proper to remark here that the
sum of 8240,500 has been funded and redeemable
at the convenience of the Government,
at any time after the expiration
of five years and as such the interest
alone is estimated in the above account.
Thp amount estimated as arising from
Customs has been predicted on the returns
of the two last quarters. I feel well assured
however, that the ensuing quarters
will very nearly, if not quite double the
last. In as much, therefore as the estimate
was taken from the lowest possible
base it would be safe to conclude, that an
increase rnther than a diminution might
reasonably by expected from that source.
The amount estimated arising from direct
tax has been taken from returns made
from various counties. Little doubt remains
however, that a much larger amount
might safely be estimated
The. returns being as j*ct imperfect
from the various districts, it is impossible
co asccrtnin with precision the amount
due or? lands heretofore located. The estimate,
however, which I have here used,
though somowhat uncertain, may, notwithstanding,
be considered within reasonable
limits, in as much as the members
of Congress representing the different
districts, and professing a knowledge of
the facts, estimated the dues on lands here
tofore granted, a half a million,

MESSRS. CALHOUN AND WEBSTER.
Yesterday Mr. Calhoun replied to Mr,
Webster's speech of personality, levelled
at him some days before. Both Mr. Clay
and Mr. Webster seem to have considered
it a duty to revenge on Mr. Calhoun the
cause of the defeated money despotism,
as Anthony and Augustus did that of the
fallen Roman Dictator, on the person of
him to whom they ascribed his fall. The
business of the Senate has been suspended
for successive days, that the champions
of the bank dynasty might prove that Mr.
Calhoun had sinned most grievously; mid
in so far as they succeeded in showing'
that the Senator from South Carolina had
acted with them, we admit?indeed Mr.
Calhoun himself admitted?they made out
a had ease for him.
I3ut of all the parallels which Messrs,
Clay and Webster attempted to run out
for themselves, with the lines of policy
ascribed to Mr. Calhoun, the attempt of
Mr. Webster to show that his course and
that of his antagonist, during (he war,
were alike, was the most extraordinary.
Mr. Webster assumed that because he
voted with Mr. Calhoun against the first
bank of Mr. Dallas, they were actuated
by the same feeling in reference to the
war?that because, like Mr. Calhoun, lie
was a friend to the Navy, he was also a
friend to the country during war. Seizing,
on this idea, he intimated that all his votes
against raising troops and supplies to dc!
fend the frontiers from invasion, was simply
because he wished to direct the whole
! energies of the nation to the ocean. lie
I wished to meet Great Britain on her own
t element. Napoleon, lie said, vanquished
her on the land, lie wished the United
States to make the contest on the seas with
Great Britain. " licr march was on the
\ mountain wave," and there he would arrest
it--" her home was on the deep," and
there " he woulc -pay her a visit" This
was Mr. Webster's difference with the
Administration during the war: he differed
as to the place of conducting it only.
This was the pretext under which he
endeavored to veil every vote, and all%the
hostile attacks made by him in Congress
against the Administration, while the conllict
raged on our borders, and even after
it was brought to the Capitol. lie would
not defend the frontiers?lie would not protect
the Capitol itself?because Great Britain
had proved her omnipotence on the
ocean, and had committed the wrongs we
would redress there. JIc would be content
with nothing less than wresting the
trident from her harms, and the bright
gems from her diadem derived from her
dominion of the seas. In the midst, of all

New England, with which he was then
and is now identified, declared that it was
4< unhtcoming a moral and religious people
to rejoice" even at the victories which
our infant nary was enabled to achieve in
naval encounters!! He and his friends deprecated
the war in every way and every
where, hut especially a war at sea with
Great Britain, because there, it was insisted,
the irrcatcst inequality was felt;
there, it' we attempted to cope with the
enemy, all our naval preparations would
become his spoil, and the very provocation
of the attempt, was only calculated
to inspire activity in the pursuit of our
commerce, which would never tire until
every American ship, private and public,
became its prey. Although this was the
unircrsal outcry of the party of Mr. Webster
was a prominent member, and the
organ in Congress, yet he now pretends
that the thing he wanted was a naval war!!
We 1 lave barely to allude to this new
and marvellous explanation of the Federal
policy during the war. We shall hereafter
show the utter fallacy of this afterthought,
by-a recurrence to some prominent
proceedings, which will serve to
characterize the real character of Mr.
Webster's opposition to the war, and
which have never heretofore been adverted
to by us. We will show his truth as
