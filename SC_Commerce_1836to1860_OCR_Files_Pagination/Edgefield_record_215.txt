Fromthe Charleston Mercurj.
CHARLESTON MUST BE REDEEMtED.
Since 1789 the South has been gradu
ally stripped of her direct trade, by falso
and fraudulent legislation.
In colonial times, when there was neith
er Bank nor Bank notes, and no currency
but gold and silver, our agriculture and
commerce flourished more than they over
have done under the combination of Gov
ernment and Banking. Our exports then
to England alone, equalled our exports
since 1815 to all the world: and our imn
ports were from 5 to 7 to 1 compared to
our imports for the last 17 years.
In 1705, the exports were to the popula
tion $15 a head, and the imports were $12
B3 a head.
In 1830, when the Bank connexion was
in full force, the imports were only $1 S1
a head, and the exports $13 11 a head.
From 1815 commenced the injustice to
the South, the first cause of which was,
the alliance of Government with Hanks.
Specie was equally difficult to obtain North
and South, but Bank facilities easier to
got at thu North. The connexion has in
fact worked as a hard money system to the
South all along, and a paper credit system
to the North, more money being received
than spent in the South,the Sou'hern notes
received were sent to our Banks for specie
or exchange, to be remitted to the North.
At the North it was the reverse. The ef
feet was to take from Southern Banks their
specie, and place it in Northern Banks.
in the last six years preceeding the present,
there was collected by Governiment. in
Charleston 2,02236
And disbursed only 811,6014
Excess 2,081,032. which
was disbursed elsewhere, sent it N. York
probably, not in Carolina Bank notes, but
i specie. From 1819 to 1822, the United
States Bank drew in specie from the Sout h
and West, to New York and Philadelphia
alone, $22,523,877 94, without including
the exchanges taken. This formed the
basis of paper issues at the South, received
and paid there by Government as equal to
specie. Owing to this, while a Tariti, in
creasing the drain, depresses the Somh,
the Northern deposites in the Banks, and
the Northern trade flourish and increase
in spite of '1'Tarill' changes. Col. Elmore
gives tables proving this niost strikingly.
It goes on to show from olficial reports.
the advantage given to the North by the
6overnment :leposites,
In 1834, independent of amounts to the
credit of agents, the Government had on
deposit in New York near $5,000.00t1:
and the imports of New York increased
from 56 to 73 millions. Next year to 88
millions. In 1836, the deposites were in
creased to 12,000,000, and the imports
to $118,000,000. Next year the deposits
were withdrawn, and her imports fell to
70,000,000, a reduction of :39 millions in
one year.
Compare this with Charleston and other
Southern Cities. Having no Charleston
Deposits to trade upon, on the withdrawal
of Deposit.. Charleston fell aff in imports
only 290,000 Savannah increased 200,000
Now Orleans fell off 1,000,000-and Mo
bile underwent no change. In New Or
leans were a million and a half of deposits
which may account for the greater falling
off there. Boston awl Philadelphia fell
off iu proportion to Now York; Boston
from 25 and a half to20 millions, and Phil
adelphia from 15 to 11 and a half millions
This showed how mnch the North,and how
little the South used the public fonds in
trade. -
E .tract from the speech of the TIon. P, H.
Elmore, at the Colu~mbia dinner.
Out of niany mnodes.by which the depo
sites were made available to) the Northern
Merchant, 1.will putt a few eaises by way
of illustration. Thej~ grea t dIi liettniv, tot lie
the inmporting merchant, is t) uay the dut
lies. Suppose two miercha~nts lhave im
ported at the same time, caieb at cargo of
goods, suitable to their respective m-rklets,
and each costing, in Engltand, $100~h,000t.
One is a N. Y'ork, and thle oilher a Charles
ton merchant. I have shown m le intrequli
iy of the duties which would be levied; to
wit, at New York, 16 per eenii; at Cha;rlcs
ton, 25. rThe New Y'ork merchant wishes
to pay his duities, andl goes to .m Depisite
.lik mo burrow the motney. T'he latik,
having the public money ott deposite, is
glad to mtake six per~ cenit. aindl loans it
readily, not in mnoniey, but lby gi vintg himi
credit, on its btooks, for I 0,t',00t. \\'ilt
his certiieute, of credit. the Merchant goe's
to the Collector, and givnas him~t a chteek;
the C~ollector britngs the cheek back to the '
'lnank, anid the latnk puts1 ithe amttount to
the credit of the United Si ates aeaitn,where
it started frotm. Not a dollhw is drawnt
out orf lank; it is only a shiliinug of creudits.
The C harleston Merchanitt goes to a ltiank,
to borrow $25,000. The llank has no
deposites to loan uponti, aind ii w~l know'r
if it gives its own bills, that as soon as they
aire paid to thte Colletor, he will require
their redemtption in specie; or exchant ge;
to remit elsewhere. It tdme not boai the
mnoney; and1( the Merchtant, who impno~trts,
misteald of sending all his caipitatl.. to mtake
his puirchiases, miust thus reserve 25 pert
cent to pay his ditties. Is ii Potssible, that
he can, itus loaded with heuvier' dutics.
and compelled to reserve a part of his
capital, compete, on egnal tertms, with hi~s
more fortunate rivatl, who, in addition to
te use of his entire capitail, haus lie money
of the Governmeint to aid bim.
Another illutstration. T1he duties collect
ed, in every qluarter, lheyotnd what is spiet
at the place of colletiotn, are trainsferredh
to the point where they may be most con
vemnently available to Goenet Th'lai
city has growiln to lie the greait poiii of i ii
portation. All the United States are its
customers; andiu exchngue is in its fatvor.
A N. York merchati wishes to pity for the
$100,00) wvorth of' goods bought in Enig
land, which we have spoken oif before.
he applies to the depiosite latnk, for a
credit lor~ $100,000. it is readily given,
as there are ptlenity of pub~llic funids on de
posite, atnd the latik makes its 6 1per cnt.
lie takes it in the frmi of Blills, or certihi
cates of dleposite-setnds i hietm to his agenit,
ia Charle.,ion, whio sells them to vonr
merchants and rutailcrs, wvho tire hnSling

and there bells; pays for .tho 100,000 of
goods and pockets a profit besides,' These
goods, thus paid for by your produce, he
sells to your mterclants, who have bought
his bills; .receives the samo bills in pay
nent, and, going to the Deposite Bank,
wvhere he got the credit, pays oll'the debt,
in the bills ho borrowed. Thus, again,
without one dollar being drawn out, the
Bank realizes six per cent on the deposites,
and ihe merchant, with the credit they sup
ply. gets possoesiu of Southern cnpital,
and carries on his speculation, making a
profit on every operation in the whole
transaction.
The operation of this system, in the ag
gregate, on the State, is worthy of exam
ination. I will endeavor to submit it. At
the Rail Road Convention, at Knoxville,
July. 1836, a Comumitteo of the South
Carolina Delegation, on which were six
gentlemen from Charleston, of the highest
intelligence mnd respectability, four of thea
eminent merchants, sulmtinted a Commer
cial Report to the Convention, in which
they stated, that there was $15,000,000
worth of mierchandizo sold annually in
Charleston. Merchaudize sold in Charles
ton in one year, $15,000,000
Deduct for Mer
chants' profits on
prime cost, 20
per cent, $3,000,00.
Do. for domestic
articles. of all
kinds. 4,108,195.
Do. For foreign
goods, imported
direct in 1835. 1,891,803,
9.00G,000
Showing, of foreign goods reach
iugCharlestoa, circuitously $6.000,000.
We will assume, for the sake of sinpli
fying the argument, that all these were
through New York. The New York im
porter has nt profit of not less than 13 per
cent, or -00J.UO; and when to this is add
ed, freight, insurance, and other necessary
expenses in sending them to Charleston, it
is not too nmomehi to say, the Sta.te has lost,
at least $1,0)0,000. on the year'a business;
which mast be paid too in the products of
your State, which art; equal to specie,
abroad or at home: or. what is the same
hing, it is lost in the price ol your rice and
cotton. Had these yiiofts. year by year,
that they hive been drawn fromt you. been
made by your own merchants, and kopt
at home, anl enriched our cities they would
not now exhibit either decay or dilapida
tion.
* at a a s
It was said, in the Knoxville Report, noi
doubt truly, that "m'terchandize may be itu
poted into Charleston, front Europo, on
more favorable terms, than into N. York.'
In this opinion, all t he importing merchants
of Charleston, with whom I have con
versed or corresponded. concur. What of
late years has prevented it, has been the
artificial advantage. given by the Govern
ment and bank connexion, to their rivals.
It is this reason, which they clearly per
ceive. that causes the great unanimity of
ours merchants and bankers, for the sepa
ration, and in support of the Independent
'reasury, and its specie receipts. They
clearly see that it will benefit Southern
banks, and Southera. trade. ''he idle cry,
that it is a war on hanks, and credit, they
know is unfounded. They well know the
amountofspecie required for this demand,
and will be prepared to ieet it. The
pressure will be gentle, and kinl, in com
parison to that harsh and inexorable run
produced by the United States batik. and
even the deposite Hank system-ta pres
sure then stimulated the purpose of ri
val institations, to lessen the business and
profits of our banks, and, by taking their
specwe and ealital, to increase t heir ow&n.
But, say the alaurmiists, if tihe Government
reluses the pap~er of the- baniks. the peoiple
tom will refuse to tatke it. A fact, is worth
maore tatin thaeory. F'rom Jnoly. I1$3G, by
law, the hilts ofevery banik which: issuaed
or circulatced a hanak note tunder S5, wer~e
refused by the Glovernmnt. The bank
of this Staite has always issuled tnies tun

it world have required 20 or 30 millions
additional of specie, to .supply. its place?
Yet all the country supported that measure,
and we heard uonp of those cries of its des
ulating tendencies, which are now sung
in our ears by is own authors, Compared
with this, its drain upon the world for
specie would have been vastly greater, and
the price of our staples, if their present
theory be true, ruinously depressed. The
highest estimate put on the amount of
specie required, if this Bill passes, is $10.
000,000. when it is in full operation; but,
as it gives six years to get into full opera
tion, it will require $1,666,666 GG to be
provided every year, far six years until
the sum reaches $10.000,000. I will not
detain you to show the amount of specie
estimated to be in the world; nor to show
how insignificant is the suan required by
this Bill, in comparison with it. it issuf
ficient to know. that from 1830 to 1838,
about 80 millions have been imported in
to the United Stats, of which, more than
50 millions remain; and notwithstanding
this immense addition (five times more
thou will be required.) our Cotton rose in
price, from 1830 to 1837, almost double,
and rice and tobacco did not fall. This
very year, on one speculation, the Bank
of England-the most cautious and jeal
ots of institutions-sent to New York 10
millions of specie; and at that Very time
cotton was rising in the British markets?
Mr. McCull.gchi, in the learned treatise on
Commerce, calls specie a commodity, and
says that England, from 1815 to 18:33, im
ported an extra supply of40 to ?50,000,
000, of specie etqual to 180 to 200 millions
of dollars; and yet, during that period, site
made her most giattic advances in gen
eral commerce. In the immense increase
of product ions for exehange, commerce h as
little need of gold and silver, except for
settling balances, and for dotnestic circu
lation.
But, weaker, and utterly unfounded, is
another objection, that it creates a Govern
m1weit Bank. What is a Bank? An in
stitution endowed with the privilege to is
sue notes, receive the funds of others on
deposite, and loan out its funds on dis
count. I hold the Bill to create the Inde
pendent 'Treasury in my hand, and have
carefully examined it, from beginning to
rind. I iavite all to do so who desire to
aindersanad it. There is nai, in it, the
slightest authority given, either to issue
notes or bills. to receive deposites, or to
loan out its funds in discounts, or other
wise. Ott the contrary, to loan them, will
he a felon, punished bv ianfany, fine and
imprisonment. "It has int.'' in the words

and he must either he recklese, utterly ig

To the Oflicers. Engineers, and others in
terested in Rail Rouds.
Owing to certain erroneous statementjt,
which have been published, in relation to
improvements that I have made in loco
motive engines and rail roads, for the pur
pose ofovercoming elevations; I think pro
per, in order to come at the truth of the
subject, and to lay it fairly belbre those
who are interested, to make the following
proposals:
I will a;,ree to furnish engines that will
convey the same attomnt of load uip incli
nations of 200 to 250 feet rise per mWile,
that is conveyed by the present tmlode of
construction, up grades of 30 to 5U feet
rise per mile: or convey the same amount
of load up the inclinations first mentioned,
that is, pr 'pelled at the rate of 18 miles
per hour upon a level track.
Or further, I will agree to furnish on
gines that will draw 10J to1- up inclin.
tions of 201) feet rise per utile, or 50 tons ti
grades, of'-100 feet rise to the mile, engines
conducted with safety. and hut little annu.tl
expense, more than of fuel for the genera
tion of power; and the tiue, in consequence.
ofa slower motion upon the inclinatiou,the
efl'ective pressure per square inch in the
cylinders, to le the same in all eases.
To any company that may think it to
its advantage to ascertain nami descend in.
eliuations, as above. I will agree to fur
tish engines that will accobm plish all that
I have stated; and it' I do not, no charges
will he made to the coapanuy.
The expense of the engines will lie lit
little more than those now in use, and be
as little liable to get out of order.
The diameter of the wheels used in as
cending, will depend upon the angle of in
clination, and the amonunt of load to be
drawn; they are prevented from slipping
or revolvimg without moving the land, by
thetoanhined action of adhesion and gear
ing, and are so constructed as to run with
hut little friction, the great amount of
which has coandetned other plans.
It is unnecessary to intake any remarks
respecting the action of miodhels upont a
snbject of'this kind. if the amount of frie
aion caused by the engine and load upon
the inclintion, is known. which, added
to the rravity, gives the total resi.:nalce;
and if the size of the drIvigu wheels is
knoawn, the length of stroke, the diameter
of the cylinders, and the efreeriv. pessure
per square inch. i will be ;att ta:y matter
to coie to a correct conclusion thow much
of an elevation may be ascended with any
given load.
A model of said itnprovement may be
seen at the fair of the A terienn Instiitte.
where any iaformation in relation to the
subject n ill he given by the inventor,,fron

RAIL ROAD BANK-ARRIVAL OF SPe
ciE.-The Osceola which arrived yesterday
fron London. brings out near half a ial
lion of dollars in Gold and Silver. inpor
ted by the Directors of the Louisville,
Cimcimnaitti and Charleston Rail Road
Coin pany, for the use ofathe South Western
Rail Road flank. The subscription in
this Bank will he finally closed oil Thurs
dlay next. The Stockholders will meet in
Charleston in person or by their proxies
on the 20th inst. to elect Directors-their
Bills are already engraved, a temporary
Ranking House will be provided, and now
that an abundant supply of specie has
been procured, the Bank will go inmedi
ately into operation under the most flavora
ble auspices. The wise foresight and
liberal policy displayed in this importa
tion of specie is highly creditable to the
Conpany. They might have looked to
the Charleston Ranks, or those of New
York and Philadelphia for the supplies ne
cessary for the low Bank. But this would
have created a pressure in the money mar
ket, sand created tan apprehension of the
increase of the Banking Capital of the
country, without :a cerresponding enlarge
maent of the specie basis. The course hat
has been pursued, will greatly stretgtihen
the Bank, and gain for it public confielence
at home and abroad. To Charle ston in
particlar, this measure is caleulated to do
essetntial service. The million loan so
happily elTeeted by Gen Hamilton in Et
rope. heing added at this titte to the capi
tal of Charleston. nnill give stability to all
our coliamercial and finacial operations.
Onte hilf the amount lieing transferred by
hills of exehangie, fir.t to New York nid
then to Charlestnt, will furnish us the
metsans of keeping doew n the Exchanie and
thus prevent a drain upon our Banks for
Specie. It will he sects from the above
statement, how entirely unfounded are the
reports prevalent in certain quarters, of
large drafts having beetn made thronarh the
agency of Gen. Hlamiltot, fromu the North
ern Banks. to supply our Rail (toad Bank
with Specie. Not a dollar has been drawn
for any such purpose. We have been at
the expense and trouble of providing our
selves %%ith the requisite amount of specie
fora Europe.

Charleston herseIf aguin!-We believe
it to be perfectly sale far the inhabitants of
Charleston to return to their homes, with
out aisy fear of being assailed by the stran
ger's fever. Our reasons for this belief
are that we are assured that ice was obser
ved yesterday morning, by the resideats of
Cannonborough a and Hampstead. and that
we are assured that a heavy white frost, of
sufflcieot volume to enable- a. person to
scrape up a considerable quantity, was
seen within the city.-Courier.

ATLANTIC STAt NavoATo.-The
New York Post states that at a meeting of
merchants of New Yprk, held at the Carl
ton louse, on Thursdahy, it was agreed to
take sleps to form a company to lie called
the - American Atlantic Steam Naviga
irnon Conpany." and to procure an act of
Iucorporation fromn the Legislature for that
puts pose. It is intended to build ships to
"navigate the ocean by steam," and the
shares are to be $500 each. Amount of
capstal not stated. A steamer of 2000 tons
nal upwards %% ill doubtless be the first ves
sel built.
The Express adds that the preliminary
step-, have been taken, su,:h its procuring
eseisrmates of building the ships and ma
chinury, and it is sud that the greatest ob
sacle which presented, is obviated-the
dilficulty of proeuring machinery in this
country. The West Point Foundry are
preparing the necessary means to make
suttuble engines.
E.recution.-Tihe Charlottesville (Va.)
Advocate of tiu 3d inst. states that the two
negroes, Lucinda and Andrew, lately con
victed in Both county,of the murder of Mr.
Mayse's children, were executed,agreeably
to their sentence, at the Warm Springs,on
the 24th ultinto. A gentleman who was
present states that they persisted to the
lost, im denying all agency in the murders.
It is also stated, that the girl, on whose tee
tinony chiefly these slaves wereconvicted,
has smnce her acquitnal confessed that she
