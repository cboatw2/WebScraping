WEDNESDAY JIOJtNING, JILY 22,
Congress was to adjourn on tim 21s',
but owing to mismanagement at some of
the Post offices, our latest account is only
to the 16th, and that from a New York paper*
The Committee on elections had reported
in favor of the sitting members, an J . the
house had adopted the report with the aid
of the previous-question, 102 to 22, many
whigs refusing to vo:e, as time was not al lowed
I hem to examine the testimony.
The British Queen arrived in New York
on the 19th, bringing isngtisn papers to
July 1st. The collon market v.as active,
withou* a change of price. A youth 17
yeaisofnge ha J shot tvo pistols at ihe
Queen, without effect, as slie was riding in
Hydo Park with Prince Albert. The as.
sassin was immediately apprehended, but
made no confession.
Extract of a letfer from a commercial house in N.
York, to a hriu in this place:
"The steamer, British Queen, arrived to-day?
left July 1st The arrivals of cotton into Liverpool
during die month of June, had been heavy. Sales
.large and prices firm. It will probably have little
or no efi'ect on our market here."
Louisiana Election.?In the Congres
^ sional district embracing the city of NewOrleans
E. D. White (Whig) hr.s been
elected by a majority of about 1391) o\er
Leonard (Van H Ten.) In the second dis.
trict, Dawson (V. l> ) has been elected by
a majority of 13 over Morgan (W.) This
is a gain for the administration party. In
the third d stnc', the administration candidate
is believed to be elected. The B e
snysthe Senate will stand unchanged, 8
VVh igs 9 Administration; and that lite
Whigs will probably leave a majority of 4

Commodore Elmot.?'I he trial of this
"officer, u nil or various charges of official misconduct,occupied
several weeks of a naval cour.
martia now sitting in Philadelphia, andlattracted
much attention. In regard to the result'
the National Gazette says.*
We Irarn that the sentence of the Court
Martial, which recently tried Commodore Elliot
in this city on sundry charges, is suspen.
atcn from Ins functions for four years and withholding
of his pay for two years. Whether
the President has approved of the sentence,
and on what charges it is founded, we have
not heard,?but as far as we state, our information
is positive.
"We indulged the hope that our immediate
Representative, the Hon. John
Campbell, would have voted with the
fitate, on the pa-sage of the Independent
Treasury bill. Had there been a doubt,
as to the will of the State on that point,
he would have been justified in the exercise
of his private judgment, but as he
knows there is not, ne should have
deferred to the verdict of the State, and
^ voted for the bill. He could well enough
have given such a vote, stating at the
' ** i-i! -- -f ll..
time, lie die. so as representative ui me
State, but in opposition to his own opinion.
"
The above w!?ich is part of a longer
paragraph in the George Town American
of last week, we copy, not for the purpose
of entering into any discussion of
the Sub -Treasury question; but for the
purpose, as an impartial collector of news
and politics, of letting our readers sec
bow much ground of complaint the American
lias in the premises.
\Vhen the Independent Treasury bill
was before Congress two years ago, Col.
Campbell voted against it, and published
his reason* for doing so, at the time, in
the George Town Union.-the predecessor
of the American. Immediately before
the next election, lie addressed a circular
to his constituents, declaring himself
a candidate for re election, and stating
the reasons for his vote against the Sub
Treasury bill. From this circular wc
copy the following paragraphs.
Fellow Citizens:?Understanding that
groat diff'rcwc of op'nion exi>ts among
you iu r ilation to my vote on the lute44 SubTreasury
Bill," and holding myst IF responsible
lo you not only for the faithful hut for
the proper discharge of mv duties as your
representative, I adopt this method of communicating
somf of-thc reasons which inflii
cnceu ntoin tti.it vote?avoiding ft* tftt*
practicable, a repetition of argumens con.
tuined in my publislctl letters upon the same
subject.
i am in favor of separating government
funds from banking pui poses. Such a so.
& pa ration I believe to he correct in principle,
and ifenrried into effect, would I doubt not
prove beneficial in practice.
- f voted against ilio Sub-Treasury Bill
recently rejected* in the flouse of Itepresrelatives,
because it contained a provision
which required after a rertain time, that all
the government duns should be collected in
government paper or in gold and silver exclusively.
*. *- * *
The state of ray health, having recently
b"<1 a severe attack of fever which has left
tijj very fcebl *, and old associations s:i I
\
cherished Ibr rhe geuiloman opposed to me,
would have rendered it agreeable to have
declined a re-election. But understand ng
I that my vote on the lat'*Sub?Treasury Bill
j was disapproved of,and tinding a candidate
: in the fhdd on my return hom^, I felt bound J
in honor to allow my name again to be (
presented to my constituents. *
Here then it is plain that the issue j
made before the people, of the Pee Dee g
Congressional District, was, whether or j
j not they would, by their votes, sustain J
'j their representative in his vote against
1 the ''Independent Treasury" bill. Col.
! Campbell told them that he felt bound i
in bono? to let this question be brought 1
11 fairly and directly before them, and what [
t
! was the result? He was elected by an (
I increased majority over the respectable '
gentleman who had been- his opponent t
at the preceding election. He was clear- '
ly elected then on the very ground that
he was opposed to a Treasury bill con.
taining a provision that the public rcve- 1
nuc should, after a time, be collected in jc
! specie; and the bill passed at the late (
| session, for voting against which com- y
j plaint is now made against Col. C., i
! did contain such provision. Had he t
; vot d for it, the vole would have been a '
f
! most marked contempt for the will of his
constituents expressed at the polls, and a {
direct contradiction ot the professions
on the strength of which lie was elected. 1
I . . <
Whether or not the vote was, in itself
c
considered, right, we do not now inquire, j
I But it was such as his constituents'knew i
when they elected him he would give, t
and such as their vote at that time bound
i him to give. Let, tlien, justice be done. (
As to the doctrine of the American, \
i that a representative in Congress is
1
j bound to regard the will not, of his own 1
constituents, but that of the constituents 1
i . 1
; of his colleagues, we suppose the editor ,
*
; will find not very many to agree with j
| him in it. 1

Thebankrupt bill is dead. The House
resterday naileil it to the table, by a decisive
vote. It was read twice as a Senile
bill and Mr. Pickens then moved to
ay it, on the table, giving as a reason foi
Jus course, the want of time, at this late
itagc of the session, for acting on so important
a subject. lie also suggested
bat immediate action on the hill was the
ess necessary, as it was not to go intc
>peration till the 1st of February next.
1 he motion was agreed to?yeas 101,
lays 89. There were about a dozen
ivhijgs in the affirmative?so it was *not
listinctly a party vote. It is possible
hat a re-consideration may be moved tolay,
but without any chance of success.
Phis meusure which lias attracted so
nuch public attention, and which was so
ong and carefully deliberated upon in
he Senate, did not obtain even a hearing
n the House.
Mr. Tkipi.ktt moved a call on the
War Department for a detailed statemenl
>f the expenditure in the Florida, war,
o be laid before the House at the nexi
iession. lie said the appropriations had
>eeii twenty millions, but lie wanted the
terns of expenditure. It was objected
hat the report would make a volume a*
jig as the Bible, but the resolution was
igreed to.
The navy appropriation bill was taken
ip and debated.
An amendment, appropriating sixl)'
housand dollars for a third steam vessel
>f war, was agreed to. This sum is o'
:ourse intended only to commence tin
reparations for the vessel. An effort
nade to strike out the appropriation foi
he construction of a dry dock at Neu
k'ork. There is an existing law for this
vork. Three dry docks were authorizet
iome years ago, one at Charleston, nuo
:herat Gosport, and a third at Neu
fork; but the construction of the lus
las beeu delayed. Mr \V. Tiiompsoj
moved to amend by adding an appropri
ition for a dry dock at Pensacoln, <im
,vent-into a series of statements and ar
guments as to the itn; ortancc of tlia
place as a naval station, in reference tr
the commerce of the Gulf of Mexico. Tin
notion, however, did not prevail. Tin
.Vew York dry dock was*resisted on th(
ground that the Treasury at this tinu
:annot bear the expense;-that it was uu
necessary for the navy, and that floatim
Jocks could he built at a twentieth par
>f the expense, whenever wanted. Bu
he motion to strike out was lost. Tin
)ill wa9 finally reported and passed.
In the Senate, a bill authorizing thi
Secretary of the Navy, at his pleasure
o put an officer on furlough, with hal
jay, was discussed. It was opposed a:
onferring too much authority on the
Secretary, and was laid on the tabic.

In the Senate an abolition memorial
vas presented for the first time, these

?*gy society of East Pennsylvania, ant
>rayed that the people of that Common

o support the institution of slavery, b}
;iving up fugitive slaves or otherwise.
The question of reception was laid or
he table. The rule of the House prohib
ting the presentation of abolition peti
ions has worked admirably well, by dc
wiving the abolitionists of facilities and
nducemcnts to keep up an cxcitcnieul
in the subject.

on the necessity of a change in judicial

success was not to be expected-, but the
I work of reform must be commenced
i somewhere, and at some time; and, in
their opinion, this was the place and this
the time. They wanted to see the vote
on the subject, and see how the senator
i from Kentucky would vote.
Mr. Clay, oi'Kv., said he would tell!
i gentlemen how he would vote. I am I
against it, said he, and will give a certificate
to thai efi'ect.
Mr. Calhoun said if there was any one

; was the life tenure of the Judiciary. lie
was under the impresion that the change
; proposed would be eminently disastrous,
t But there was no time at this session to
go into Che consideration of a subject of
t such vital importance. Every member
I of this body would wise to study the
; question deeply before he gave his vote,
I and every member would wish to be

FIRST PRINCIPLES OF GOOD PLOUIHNG.
j The season is now opening 'o commence
! your ploughing; every farmer, nnd every
i- J farmer's boy feels perlmps as if ho knew
o j how to hold nnd drivo the plough, better
e ! than the man who writes; nil this nmy j)e
...? i. _.i i ,
true; ho Knows mm no snouiu muvit ium
c his furrow \vi<Jpr than the plough.shares
n will cut dean ; but always as much harrowe
er as stiffness of the soil shall render necosi
sary, to lay his furrows smooth an 1 light,
e and free from clods; in all such cases of
narrow furrows the cx r i expense of plough -
ir? will bo saved in the expense of hari
| a-- j? .
i- rowing, with this advantage to the crop
is that the harrow pulverizes only the surface;
iC but tiiC plough, when properly, directed
>f renders the earth mellow, to the whole depth
T | of the furrow.?This again involves the
d questions, how deep is Scsi? To this I shall
t. reply particularly, as ^ has become one of
v the most iiripoitant questions in field bus*.
v, ban dry.
I, Tne ploughing deep is of the ulSjost imi
porta nco to make land productive, r\o one
i- (who is a good farmer) will deny. Vet
ic how dep orahlc is it to sec so many of o-ir
fanners, instead ut tlieir jau h
m
persist in the old ru nous practice of merely
skimming it. Soils of the best quality nny 1
be very shortly impoverished by shallow, f:
ploughing: while on the other hand those of tl
an inferior quality maybe materially im- r<
proved by judicious ploughing. Why, it g
may be asked, are swamps and bogs So fi
inexhaustibly fertile after being drained? t!
One simple reason is because they are b
possessed of a soil of very considerable ti
depth. Then why n >t plough deep, in or- g
d?'r to increase the d :pth of soils of uplands.
Lands which have been ploughed shallow t|
on rec'iveing the first deep ploughing will
generally fail in some measures in produ- (j
eing a good crop, in consequent: of turning r,
up the clay. This lias disheartened some
that have made trail of it, so as to abandon
it immediately again. But the action of ?
the sun and atmosphere on the
upturned clay, will contribute gretoly to
its fertilizations. This being ploughed down, ti
and the former surface tnrned up again \
with the addition of proper manures, will b
give land a deep soil and render it fi rtile t
and productive. ' I
But few per3on nrc aware of the length l<
to which the fibrous roo's of grass descend c
into the ground. It has been discovered, u
with very few oxcep ions, that they reach v
to the bottom ofsoils, however deep;
consequently plants growing in deep soil
will be much better protected against the ((
ifivcts of drought than those grow.ng in a ^
sliallow so,'!.
1 would suggest, therefore, that land in
ordinary cases, be ploughed not less tlian
eight inches deep. Will it not be much
better to suffer partially in one cr->p, and 'I
thereby to have afierwarJs a manifold n
increase; than to be ulways to ling, with ; '
very imperfect returns for our I ?bof.
These statements here given contain the ?
outlines or fir.it principles of good ploughing
and the inhiute attention of cvrry farmer j
will soon discover the mode which shall
he best adapted to his d.(F rout soil, and
ddlbrent crops, with ibis general principle, "
to deepen his soil at every ploughing, as far <
as the nature of the substratum, or under '
^ ^il inrfili/i enfuft. nf hi?j rrn-i will admit! !

and therefore, in this way, ho may soon I
bring his farm into a deep tillage. The (
success of one-hajf of any one of his fields,
under a regular deep till igo, compared ,
with the other half, under n shallow tillage,! t
will ho ihtf best convincing argument in J
favor of deep ploOghing that ran he laid j ,

The Wheat Crops.?The Salisbury (N.

have exceeded I he expectations of faruvrs,
j in his neighborhood. That notwithstanding
the appearance of the chinch bug in the
I spring the yield of wheat has been good,
' and tolerably abundant.

j ult., says,44 in several sections of the coun'
try, which wc have recently seen the fields

i wheat and oMs."

The Greenville Mountaineef, of tlic
16 h Juno, says* (speaking of tile lute ruins,)
great damage has been sustained, but we
arc gratified to learn that many farmers
will realize tolerably fair crops, and that
nothing like a great scarcity ot wheat will
be experienced.
The rend/eton Messenger says, the;
wheat harvest is over, and from information
received, wo think the crop wiil Ikj somewhat
like an ave&ngc one, but will fall nearly j
one half short of that made last year, which
j .vas extraordinary in this section.
