What practicaFplantcr can doubt, that for j
tho credits annually obtained by himself
or his neighbors, at the sales of the estates
of deceased persons, and in various other
modes, he pays from 15 to 20 per cent,
more than tho same property would cost,
if purchased with cash in hand. Let the
suggested change in our economy, then,
be no longer delayed. Every planter who
adopts it will at once perceive its salutary
effects upon his own comfort, independence
and prosperity; and ho will have
tho consolation of- reflecting, that he is
at the same time performing the duty of a'
patriot citizen. Wc confidently believe

capital that would otherwise be necessary
for carrying on our foreign commerce by
a system of direct importation.
But whatever may be the agency of a
well regulated credit, in bringing about
the proposed reform in our foreign commerce,
a very considerable money capital
will nevertheless be indispensable to its
complete accomplishment. Nor can it be
doubted that the staple growing States
have the most abundant resources for supplying
this description of capital, it the!
planters, who are our principal capitalists,
can be induced to abandon the suicidal
course they have heretofore pursued, of
devoting their whole income (generally
anticipation) to the purchase of negroes
to produce more cotton; and appropriate,
even a moderate portion of it, to aid in
the accomplishment of this great enterprize.
If every planter would take a dispassionate
and comprehensive view of
his own individual interest, he would perceive
that the blind instinct of accumulation,
which prompts him to make the crop
of one year the means of increasing that
of tllO next, -is the most fntnl nnlinr lio
. - f J ..V
could pursue. It is a system which, in
the very nature of things, must inevitably
defeat its own purposes. It will hardly
be stating the case too strongly, to
say, that at least one half of the incomes
thus devoted to the increased production
of cotton, are devoted to over production,
and that they are consequently appropriated,
not for the benefit of the cotton
planters themselves, but for that of the
foreign and domestic consumers of their
great staple. The principle of political
economy laid down in the report of the
Select Committee, and from which this
conclusion is deduced, was known to practical
men long before it was promulgated
by any writer on the theory of wealth.?
It is founded upon the universal experience
of mankind. If the supply of any
article materially exceeds the effective demand,
a competition is created among the
sellers, which depresses the price greatly
be) or.d a due proportion to the excess in
quantity, in iiko manner a deficient supply
creates a competition among the buyers,
which increases the price in a corresponding
degree. S ? general is this principle,
thut we may safely affirm, that in any probable
slate ot the demand for cotton, a
small crop, if not extremely small, will
produce a larger aggregate income to the
cotton planting States, than a large one.
Between the extreme points where high
prices check consumption on the one
hand, and low prices check production on
the other, there is a wide range for the
operation of this principle. There is no
class of producers so likely to stiller from
?ovcr production as the cotton planters.
Widely dispersed oder an immense territory,
without the means of consultation
or concert among themselves, they cannot
prevent the habitual occurrence of
excessive crops, unless they adopt a system
which will of itself havo a constant
tendency to prevent it. The basis of that
.1 '
Bjaiuui siiuuiu uu uic investment ol at
least a fair proportion of their nclt annual
income in some other profitable pursuit,
instead of investing it in land and
negroes; and we believe there is no such
pursuit that promises a more abundant reward
to industry and enterprize, than the
direct importation of foreign merchandize
through our Southern seaports. Where,
/or example, a man of known integrity,
capacity and industry, with a moderate
capital, shall be engaged or disposed to
engage in the business of foreign importations,
what more public spirited and
profitable appropriation can a planter
make of a portion of his surplus capital,
than to invest it in this importing concern,
as a limited copartner, under the wise
cuiu'iinunis recently adopted in several of :
the staple growing Stalos?
One half of the nett income of the cotton
planters, thus applied for a few years
only, would furnish abundant capital for
conducting our whole foreign commerce.
May we not confidently anticipate,
therefore, that the planters, who arc so
deeply interested in the results of the
great commercial reform we are attemp-1
ting to effect, and whose co-operation isj
so indispensable to its success, will put
their shoulders to theAvheel at once, with
a firm resolution to contribute every aid
that may be required for the accomplishment
of so glorious an cntcrprizc?
Taking it for granted that all the difficulty
anticipated on this score, will vanish)
bctore the public spirited cnterprize of1
our capitalists, we look forward with1
fcftpw equally sanguine, to tfte rem oral oi
the existing obstruction* to the intercourse
between our importing cities, and the
vast interior which they are destined tu
supply with the manufactures of foreign
countries. In this view of the subject
too high an estimate can scracely be
placed upon a rail road communication
between the Southern Atlantic cities anil
tho navigable waters of the West. The
most high wrought visions of enthusiasm,
will, we doubt not, be found, in the rapi.l
progress of events, to sink down into insignificance,
when compared with the
splendid realities which time will soon develope;
and, we confidently anticipate,
tiiat"ion years hence, history will exhibit
to us results which the most excited imagination
would not now venture to predict.
This magnificent"scheme of inter<
nal communication will give us the command
of the whole Valley of the Mississippi,
in spite o( the established ascen1
- - - -
nancy 01 tne northern cities, in the busi<
ness of foreign importations and*internal
commerce. For whether we scale the in
tcrposing mountain barriers, like Hannibal,
or turn them like his more skilful
successor anci rival, the line of operations
which will carry us to the centre of this
immense theatre of commercial competi<
tion, will be but half as long as that o
our Northern rivals; and, what is ncxtir
importance, will be at all limes unobstructed,
while theirs wiP be closed up, foi
several months annually, by the freezing
of their rivers and canals. And thougf
we may neither defeat the Romans in successive
battles,.nor drivo the Austriam
out of Italy, by annihilating successive
armies, we shall perform an achievement
more glorious than either that of Hannibal
or Napoleon, while we conquer am1
bless, by the peaceful weapons of indus
try and entcrprize, plains incomparably
more rich and extensive than tliosc whicl
they overrun and desolated by the destruc

It is impossible for any enlightened aiu
patriotic citizen of the Southern Slatet
to contemplate, without enthusiasm, tin
beneficial effects which will be producet
on our commercial, social and politica
relations, by opening a direct communi
cation, with tho great Valley of the Mis
sissippi. It will form an indissoluble bom
of union between communities whose in
tercsts arc closely interwoven, and wil
give a tenfold activity to a commerce
which even the Alleghany heights hav<
not bccn*ablc altogether to prevent. Tin
commercial cities of the South Atlantic
and of the Gulf of Mexico, are undoub
tcdl v natuial marts of the Western pcoph
l?>r obtaining their supplies of foreign tner
chandize. It is there they find a marke
for the principal part of their own staph
productions, even now, when they ob
tain their supplies of foreign merchan
dizc from the Northern cities, by a com
plicated and expensive operation, and Ir
a long and tedious transportation. IIov
decidedly would it be to their interest t?
obtain, by a direct exchange, their forrigi
merchandize from the communities when
lliey sell their domestic productions, av/?i
ding all tho expense and delay and hazart
ol purchasing bills on the North! And
how great and overwhelming will be the
preference due to this direct intercourse
of exchanges, when the transportation ol
their merchandize shall be but half ir
point of distance, and one-sixth in point
of time? Every merchant who understands
experimentally the importance of time ir
the transportation of his merchandize
II ? - " * *
win ai once perceive the decisr'c ailvan
tage which ihis circumstance alone wil
give to our Southern cities over thcii
Northern competitors. We, therefore
regard the completion of the line of communication
to which we have alluded, as
a principal and most efficient means ol
establishing a system of direct impor'ations
through our Southern cities, and
breaking the shackles of our commercial
dependence. When it shall be completed,
the commerce of foreign countries
on the one hand, and of the great West
on the other, will seek our Southern importing
cities, by a direct line of communication,
so cheap and expediti >us,
that both parties will find it their interest
to mecUtherc and effect their various exchanges.
This great work, though ilsell
an artificial structure, will be the mean?
of throwing commerce into its natural
channels. Entertaining these views, we
cannot but strenuously urge it upon oui
fellow citizens, and the political authorities
of our scspective States, to give every
practicable aid towards its accomplishment,
and that of the lateral communications
which may be necessary to rendei
its benefits more diffusive. Let us art nol
only efficiently, but promptly. AVc musl
seize the propitious occasion, now presented
to us, lest it pass away and never return.
The practicability of this rail road
communication, is no longer doubtful.?
Indeed, it may be said that it is nearly
half completed by one route, and will b<
more than half completed when the rail
road shall have been extended, as it soot
will be, from Augusta to Madison, it
Georgia. Connecting this with the Charles
ton and Hamburg rail road, we shall l?av?
more than 210 miles of continuous rai
road on a direct line to the navigable wa
ters of the Tennessee, and conducting in
to a point not more than 200 miles d?s
tant from those waters. On this subjec
we cannot be too deeply impressed will
: the necessity of sacrificing local predi
| lections to the common good. JUet tha
I line be adopted which shall be the shor
| test, cheapest and best, without the sligh
test regard to those conflicts of local in
1 tcrest, which arc, at best, comparative!]
+- '
f unimportant, ind perhaps purely imagi>
nary. The great benefit which our whole
> interior is to derive from a direct trade,
> both with foreign countries and the VVcbi
tern Slates, must be reflected from our
i' *
, ia(i|iurkiii|( rinei*. At it cauBCtf llil'SG (O
-grow and flourish, the whole interior,
i withi ? the sphere of circulation, will pur j
I ticipale in their prosperity, by a law which
> is as certain in its operation, as that which
, causes the blood of the animal system to
1 flow (rum the heart to the extremities.
Such, fellow citizens, are the views by
which we have been actuated in culli ig
. your attention to the grave and important
, subject of this address. It was not to
l have been anticipated, that the purposes
. we so distinctly expressed through the
. reportof our Select Committee, would be
. so greatly misapprehended as they have
. been by some of our fellow citizens.?
. Surely we may claim the privilege, and
, urge t(je expediency of carrytn g on our
. own commerce with foreign nations, di
I rectly through our own cities, and by our
own merchauts, without justly incurring
. the imputati *11 of hostility to the NorthI
ern States of this confederacy. We are i
?; not aware that they have any prescriptive
i! right to act for us, any more ti a 1 they
, have to ill ink. for us. It is no hostility to
f their interests, but regard for our own,
i by which we are animated 44 It is not
. that we love Caesar less, but that we love
r Home more." We are certainly as unxir
ous to encourage, upon principles of re1
ciprocily, a direct trade with the Northern
. Slates, as with anv other norLion of the
j world. Free trade with all the world, un?
trammelled by legislative restrictions, is
I the motto inscribed on our banner. We
. know neither friendship nor hostility in
| trade. Wherever we can sell highest and
. buy cheapest, that is our market; making
r no distinction between "Trojan and Tyi
rian." But we arc opposed to an absor.
bing centralism in commerce, as well as
in government. Our recent experience
J has but loo impressively admonished us of
; the fatal revulsions to which it is calcula?
ted to expose us. We have seen a pecu|
niary pressure in the city of New York,
J throw the whole country into embarrass.
ment, and its currency and exchanges in.
to the utmost confusion and derangement;
1 whereas, if the commerce of the United
. States, external and internal, had been
1 fairly distributed through its natural chnn?
nels, scarcely a shock would have been
5 felt by the body of the people. This
3 view of the subject causes us to regret
c that the extensive trade wc carry on with
. the manufacturing States of the North,
? exchanging our raw cotton for their vari.
ous manufactures?a trade highly import
tant to both parties?is not carried on di;
rectly between the cities of the planting
. and manufacturing States, but like our
_ foreign commerce, indirectly through the
. city of New York. Almost the wholo of
y our immense exchangee centre tticro; forv.
cing thither, as it were, upon the heart,
, by something like a congestive process,
! the circulation of a system so vast, that
21 ri cannot be regularly and uniformly J
. thrown out through the natural channels
I to the distant extremities. Periodical
I disorders and convulsions are the unavoi.
dable consequence of such an unnatural
. and unhealthy condition of our commerce;
f and without pretending to speak for other
, portions of the Union, we confidently afL
firm that the people of the Southern and
. South-western States are invoked, by coni
siderations of the most enlarged patriotism,
as well as of enlightened self-intc
O
. rest, to apply a speedy and effectual rcI
medj. The means of achieving our comr

all the auspices arc eminently encourag.
