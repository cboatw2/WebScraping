Tragical Scs:;e.?We witnessed
most tragical scene at Yancy Supei
Court, that has ever been acted in any cc
in North Carolina, 'l ite facts were as
lows: About two years since, a man
the name of John Wilson, married Idli
belli il 'V of that county. Thev lived
pother about seven weeks, when some c
turbancc took place which caused tli
separation. Six months ago the husbi
filled a petition for divorce, set.ing fo
var ous causes?declaring that he v
young an J inexperienced when he marr
her, and was not acquainted \v tli her 1
t - * r> r h?*v ranil'M'f dnritiT ih? {
tliey lived together, was insuj portable, i
by hitn could not bo endured. She
swore.!, that they were raised in the sn
neighborhood, and had known each ot
from their infancy up; that he knew
character and circumstances in life peril
ly well when ho married her, and had t:d
her with his eyes op"n to all her fraiiii*
? 1
she positively denied over having been g
of any misconduct, during the time t!
cd together, but tlmt she acted towa
im the part of an affectionate wife. ?
irthcr sorted that when he was ah
to leave her, lit: made no charges ogai
her, but gave as his reason for scparati
t hat he did nc?t, nor hud he ever loved h<
that his friends had induced h;m to ma
iier merely lbr her proper v, and that
had ascertained that he could not enjoy !
with a woman he did not love.
At the last Court an issue was made
and submi red to a Jury. The petition c
answer having been read, evidence v

favor of ihe petitioner. On tlie part of
Plainiilf, the cause was submittal with
any argument, but the Counsel for the J
fondant resisted the divorce bv a long n
W W
feeling speech, in winch he alluded to i
solemni y of the marriage vow, the mm
duties it imposed on the parties, and
want ot sulliicicnt cause in that case to J
solve the bonds of matrimony.
During tliis investigation the parties w<
both in Court. The husband was app
ently young and simple, and in fact a m<
boy, and there was nothing in the least p
possessing in his appearance. The w
seemed something older and altogether
superior She is fine looking worn
with dark hair, black eyes and very <
pressivc face; she manifested great inter
in the trial.
Tito Jury after retiring a few moments,
turned a verdict for the plaintiff. The p
tics were still in their seats behind
b.-ir, some six or eight fern distant fn
each other: the wiib asked a gentlem
by whom she was sitting for h:s kn
as if to trim her linger nails; she felt of l
edge, rose to ner leer, puuseu a moult
turned pale, her eyes flashed fire, and tl
suddenly sprang forward with the dra'
knife and aimed at her husband a deac
blow. But fortunately a lady who w
standing by saw her get the knife, and pi
Ceived from her countenance that she u
meditating something of a desperate c!u
acter, watched her until she saw the b'#
aimed fit the throat ot the unsuspecti
husband, and instantly seized tlie arm
the infuriated wife and diverted the wean
from the object at which it was aimed: I
determined on her hellish purpose, s
threw the knife with pre at violence at h
husband, and turning, made a most furio
attack on lier whose hand arrested t
blow and thw.ired the wicked design. T
Cour? order.xl her in'o custody; she w
arrested and borne out of the Court, maki
the most wild and frantic exclamations
calling o iu-r husband in the most tend
and passionate language, and seemed

1 ] All the deposits banks of the Govern me
' of the United States in the city of No
j York suspended specie payments this wee]
i the deposite banks elsewhere have follow
! their example; which was ot course adop
;! ed by tlie S.a;c banks not connected wit
. the Government. 1 say, of course; b;
j cause it is certain that when the Goven
l mcnt banks cease to pay specie, all t!ic o'.l
. er banks must cense, and for this ch ar re.
. son : The great creditor in the United S.nt<
| is the Government. It receives for data
j the no.es of the various hanks, which at
i placed for collection in certai 1 Goven
mcnt banks, and arc paid to those (iovert
'men: banks^ in specie if required. Now,
these Government nanks, the depositors
cf the public revenue, will not pay specie fc
the very warrants drawn upon them bv :b
Treasury, tlie Government of tlic Unite
I States from that moment cease s :o pay spr
; cie to the citizens of tlie United Stales. A
: moreover, tlie Government receives forth)
ties only specie and the notes of specie pay

^ ! vernment itself wo iM refuse to receive from ,

25 ! might owe to the Government. So long, |
19 j therefore as the (iovernrnent and the Go- j
US vernmont banks wi i not pay specie 10
A J! other banks, it would be rashness in those j
<5 banks to pay specie to them: and, as
bt | they cannot make a discrimination in j
j diose whom they will pay, the only al.
33! ternativc is Jo concur with the Govern-j
'c* nvnt banks in the genera! suspension. :
in. j Our Philadelphia banks saw this. They
f?) 1 thought r useless to carry on so unequal!
i'- an intercourse, in which thov were to j
J pav to Xew York, while Xew York refused I
l,(" j to pay to Pennsylvania ; for if the Pcnnsyl-1
v* | vnnia banks paid while those of Xew York !
o*did not, the whole revenue would have been 1
? j turned into Pennsylvania no es, and specie
'd ' demanded.
xl]! In the midst of these disorders, the Rank j
n- j of the United St iles occupies a peculiar po-1
ur j sition, and has special duties. Mad i coil- I
s;> i suited merely its own strength, it would nave j
! continued its payments without reserve. Cut!
id ] Is-. Like ail the other Pennsylvania i
0.' banks, it owed a du y to the citizens of our j
as : own State ; and it was no: disposed to stand j
d-! aloof from a general movement of the o'her
of j S ate institutions, which however it might
i d | regret, it could nof rcn>ure.
a- j t2d. It was not inclined, moreover, to ;
' discredit, bv a refusal to receive it, the paper j
it. i of the other State banks which had ceased j
er ! to pay specie, still less to force its Pennsyl- i
or ; vania debtors to pay their debts in specie,
lie | when other citizens in other States were alhe
| lowed to pay in a less costly medium : thus !
vo | breaking down, for the benefit of other ;
g. States, the merchants and manufacturers j
eh r and mechanics of Pennsylvania,
n- j 3d. While the vaults of all the other j
w. ( hanks were closed, the Government of the j
ch United States would have no resource to:
:r.' procure specie but the Dank of the United j
icr | States, which oueht no' to assume tiio risk
?vs | of being the only source of supply for bull
eh j ion to the Government and the land offices ;
i).! as well as for exportation.
i 4th. The deposite banks of the Govern-1
ment would not pay their debts to the bank \
S. j of the United States. Why, then, should !
r(j! the Bank of the United S'ates pay to these j
0f i institutions, on account of the Government,
cs' specie fur their notes, when these very \
llcj banks would not pay their own debts ? There !
js would have been an equal want of recipro-1
S1 I city and of justice in such a proceeding. !
n. | 5th. There was another reason against j
0fj if, final and decisive. From the moment j
[jV t that the deposite banks of New York failed j
|v ! o comply with their engagenvn s, it was!
>jr i manifest tiiat all the other deposite banks j
v.c j must do the same, that thcro must be a uni- j
... | versal suspension throughout the country, j
j and that the Treasury itself, in the midst of |
ijV i its nominal abundance, must be practically i
j bankrupt.
1(j j In such a stale of things, the first consid !
V1 i cratton is how to escape from i:?now to I
| provide at the earliest practicable moment j
v> j :o change a condition which should no? he j
. tolerated beyond the necessity which com- j
| mandod it. The old associations, the: cxtcn- i
sive connexions, the established credit, the
,0 large cap tal of the Bank of the United
States rentier it the natural rallying point for [
t0 the resumption of specie pay men s. It I
j seemed wiser, therefore, not to waste its |
ly strength in a struggle which might be doubt-;
si, ful, while the Executive persevered, in its '
lie ! present policy, but to husband till its rcsour- j
p- j ccs so as to profit by the first favorable mo- i
yy ? mcnt to take the lead in the early rcsump ;
s- (tion of specie payments. According, the j
at i Bank of the United States assumes that po-!
r-1 saiprt. From this moment its efforts will j
at! be to ketg itscjf strong, and to make itself j
i), I sironger; always prepared and always anx-1
e j ious to assist in recalling the currency and j
j I the exchanges of the country to the point i
b- i from which thej have fallen. It will co- J
s i operate cordially and zcalonsly *S[th the:
re | Government batiks, with all the other banks,:
;i. j and with any other intluences which can aid .
It | jn that object.
at! In the mean time two great duties devolve
ie on the hanks and tiie country,
u- The first regards foreign nations?the
j second our own. We owe a debt to for* i
nt i eigners by no means large for our resour- j
w j ccs, but disproportioncd to our present
<:' means of payment. We must take care

iefly, our views 011 this subject.
We express no opiniou on the wisdom or
l!y of those counsels which first adopted this
eastire, as relief, from the severe pecuniary
stress in which this whole country is involved
-on this question men will differ, as their
ason or their politics may dictate. It is
ifficicntly obvious, what must have been its
fort on"your Institution had you been the
st to resort to it. But gentlemen, it never
is been a question for your deliberation,
hetlinr a suspension of specie payment for
ink notes was on the whole, a discreet or a
.sh policy?whither this would afford adejate
relief to the disease of the'times, or
hetiier its result would not prove more disasous
to the monetary system of the country,
ian the evil it was intended to counteract?
icse questions you found already decided at
)ur hands?and decided by these tribunals to
hose authority you were compelled to subit?or
to pay off your liabilities and close

at the only alternative left you is to say to

painst them, which in most eases it would

l'Jcr this view of t!ic subject gentlemen we
jard tlie late determination of your Board
suspend for the present specie payments
your notes, not merely as a measure of irresab!e
necessity but of imperious, paramount
