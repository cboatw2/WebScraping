A c v days since?at our own request 5
?we were politely introduced into this Fac- j
lory, by one of the proprietor0. We hud !

. extent and pertoano.i to which they were !
; carrying dieir new invention; but we ac1
knowledge ourssSves happi'y surprised and (
, happily disappoialeJ. About a year since, \
; it occurred to the Messrs. Ropes, tli.it a !
' valuable improvement might be made in i
j manufacturing the common table knife and j
; fork. Tlieir inventive genius was imme. j
; diateiy taxed for such an article. In the j
course of a few months, these articles were j
! constructed, and a Rati nt obtained for the j
j exclusive manufacture, sale and use, of.
! knives and forks, which are superior to any !
tiling else ever before presented to the pub- i
j lie, either in Europe or America. We may i
well indeed be surprised that two young ;
; men?almost boys indeed?should have, in |
the compass of a single year, produced an \
art cle which for its perfection, outvies all j
that the mechanists of Europe have been !
' able to produce for centuries.
The superiority oftbe.se knives arid forks
! consUts, chiefly, 1.?In the facts that the j
| articles are made wholly of cast slccl; 2?

; or that part which is inserted into the ban- j

3?They are all cut rut Ly a die, so that '

CONFESSION OF
SAMUEL WALKER AND CLARENDON DIX. '
His par:tier was the man who murder* d ,
, Air. Parker, nt tiiC Mechanics 8 tv:ng Hunk, j
Louisville, Kentucky.
My name is Samuel Waikor. I wac
, born in this cijy of New York in the year'
| 1812, my parents were rich and well 'o do
j in the world. I was educated for a lawyer,:
f but did not choose to finish my education,;
! so runaway from home, in the year 1824,!
j and came to the western country, where'
j my principal theatre of action was laid, j
I Nothing of importance occured to tne till j
j I reached Ciucinnatti, where 1 became .nr. |
nuaintcd wi.h a incut insinv ri\cr charac.
tors?bo\s Lkc mysclfi who persuaded me '
o go on the river. I d;d so, and immediate' \
' Iv went as cabin boy, on the old steamboatj
j Caledonia, commanded by John Basse!!. j
! Iii this manner though not the most res-j1
; pcctable occupation in the world, I made i
, my living for some six or eight months, ,
! getting a salary ot sx, seven and eight dol- j ;
| lurs per month. Being what is called a
j pretty smart hoy, [ thought that was too j
j little (or me to have, and so came to the j
; conclusion, to be better paid by helping : |
myself from the passengers pockets, when | I
I they were asleep. The liist thing I did of j t
| this* kind, was robbing a gentleman of his j t
pocket book on board the old Filiciana, j i
whilst she was lymg at the wharf; to which j 5
boat I then belonged. This circumstance 1 <

The nc\! thing I had a hand i:>, was J (
robbing ;i fj)t boatman of about seven or i i
~ . I
eight hundred dollars, and a great quantity ; \
of jewelry.?This was done on tlio Levee j t
in New Qrleans shortly after J left the Fe- !)
liciana. A short titric after lliis robbery, I t
I went to Natchez, where I robbed several a
persons. I then left there and went te t
Memphis, where I robbed a passenger on v
th eol 1 Uncle Sam. I then left Natchez i<
and went to Louisville, where I lived for very r
r;ear three years tvi'hout dmncj ??nv iVng !

hey hud been sent on errands. j |
During the stay in this place I became j i
icqnainicd with Geo. Love:!, Jones, {i
louver, and Thompson, who have j
ill since been hung, and committed with j
hem, at different times, the following drep- |
edutious, viz : In the first place we ail j
shipped on board a flat boat, bound fur New j
Orleans, lur which we were to get twenty- j
five dollars a piece. All things went tub j
?robly well on hoard, till wc got between
Padauch and the month of Ohio, between
which places, we killed the owner of the
boat and Lrother. Wo threw them both
overboard, run the boat to Memphis where
we said our cargo and boat, for which we
Ltoi 8-1.374?which we divided among four
of us : viz: Lovett, Jones, Thompson, and
myself?so oncli having 81,003 50
c "nts we conduced to go to New Orleans
?so we got on board the old Cincinnntia
at Memphis, and went to New Orleans j
At this place we staid nearly all winter, j
.anil all- we Jcno was to kill one man, back j
of mother Gordon's big house, on Girard ;
street, ftpd also buried him there. This j
was in the year 1$30 ; I 13 years of j
age, and having committed so many depre- !
dations, I was highly honored by the hon- j
orable Board of Common Scoundrels, rob- j
bers and murderers. They all said I was a j
smart hoy?a great man?and that if ? v? r '
I was hung, f would be an honor to the ir1
profession. So, wiili all of these induce- i
men's I convened in their profession.
The next tiling I did, was, to kill a man
over tiio'river opposite New Orleans, and'
robb"d him of 814,000 in the (Jn ted i
States, Louisiana and New York money.
Fins was in the month of March, 1831.
After this I got on board the old steamer
Farmer, and from thence to Weeling, Va.
where I robbed a man of a horse and
8500, and rode back to Marietta, where 1
sold my horse for 875. I then got on the
steamer Statesman, Captain Forsyth, and
robbed the Clerk's drawer of 8300; a gen- j
tleman's pocket bock of SI20, and another
nf lii? n-cl/vlj -i i>/1 'runLr 1111.1 thru tViMlf SisllftIV '
at Guliopolis. From th?;rc I stoic another j
horse from a Mr. Hereford, and went to
Portsmouth, where i robb: d the Exchange
Hotel drawer of seventy-three dollars.?I
then shipped on hoard the LutleSPY, and (
went to Cincinnati!. This was in the fail ;
of J 821.?I then got on board of the Midi.'
igan. Captain Swan and (J tp'uin Scot', and j
remained on her as cabin boy, 2 J steward,;
and steward, for nearly two years, without
committing any depredations whatever;
then I thought I had lived an honest life too j
long, and went to Louisville, in November, j
18S2, on the steamer Helen "Mar, Cap?, j
Fuller, on which passage I robbed several ;
deck passengers, and a cabin passenger of:
about 523 dollars altogether. 1 then staid j
in Louisville till the summer of 1834?when j
1 shipped on hoard of steamer Gasman, I
Capt. CLAREFDON DIX, as steward of j
her. There I shall give an account how i
wc worked together?and from it hope the !
steamboat men, from Captain to the mean- j
est station on a steamboat, may learn to
sliun all bad practices?and also I hope, it '
may put owners on their gu irJ?in the 1
first place to inquire into the character fi
every commander of .a steamboat, with the j
strictest scrutiny ; also to commanders of
steamboats, I would say, be careful who j
you hire for any situation whatever, even !
to a fire man ;?if I choose to disclose I
names, people who are now highly honored J
and respected by all who knew them would j
socn be knocked from the stations lli v J
now liii and be damned for ever. Hut this j
is not going on with what concerns me, for j
I know that my lime in this world is but j
short-.-so to go on with my story.
Directly alter the Galenian left Louis- j
villi?, I was watching all the passengers to ,
si e who had money and who had not. [
Amongst the res', I observed an ;
aged gentleman w ith about $6000 '
in specie in his trunk ; he came to j
me and said, .Steward, if you will put my j
trunk tn oiy state room 1 will give you a I
dollar ; certainly, says 1 ; and Jinmcauixiy j
did so. After we got 'in the state room,;
from amongst the passe, gers I inquired ot j
him where lie went aslicre at ? He told j
me that he got out at Smilhlnrd ; so I was j
d* tin mined that lie should not carry Ins j
trunk ashore with all that money in if, nor j
got any of it. So knowing that we would J
reach Smith! md at day-light in the morn- I
ing, 1 intended to take it that night wh.cn he I
was asleep ; and ahout 12 o'clock I went j
into lee door an t there found Cap'. Dix
robbing the trunk. Sajs f, hold on C?p* :
tain, that's my game-.-and I see plainly !
It is yotn's?s > let's divide, and looking j
at that instant on the bed where the oil
man lay, ! saw the blood gushing from his
heart, and a dagger laying by his side.-.- 1
riien savs Dix to me if von are rnv friend, I
. J . ( v '
and this is your game only stick will) ine j
and 1 will make your fortune*-.'?so come :
let us take and throw this old son of a i
b c!i in the river, bo we opened |
the window,.**.! got on the outside of it and j
Cap'. Dix handed his head to me. I then ;
put my arm around his head, and body, and j
gave him one pitch in the river-?taking a j
good care to throw the bed clothes over i
w tli him. After this atluir, he told me that j
i must go as a passenger. Accordingly j
when we came to Louisville, the crew was j
paid off--he hired an entire new one- ;
having a black steward and cook always
ill he quit the boat; and I went passenger j
.ip anJ down several times ; and it not bong
worth while to relate every circuni-;
stance, I travelled as a sportsman, and in
:i?njuuction with Captain Dix robbed paster.ger
after pass* nger, every trip, until wo
juit her. lie then went up the river top
>omc place, and I believe got married to a
roung lady by whom he had one child. He !
hcncctne down to Louisville about three !

missed his footing, and in trying to save '
himself lost his hat. The exhibition was ;
truly unfortunate-...the spectators laughed,
and looked at the Englishman, expecting !
him to iaugh too. On the contrary, he not
only retained his composure, but promptly
advanced to where the hat had rolled, and j
taking it up, presented it with an air of unaffected

The two houses, to day, took their seats J
in the B"jncsen:ai:vt'.s51 loll, Messrs. Speak
its Le'cher :.n I'Wickhtle presiding. Near'
two hundred ladies,iv< ro within the b:r of!
the Hous'\ and he lower and upper ga'ler- |
ics were crowded with nil z"es an I strangers.
Members of Congress, former
rnenib* rs ofti.e House, <5cc.. were invited ]
to take seats among the members. I avail-.
ed myself of the invitation, and took a favorable
position for lie iring the speak' r,
and not a word escaped rile. The Com |

Tiie Carolinian then rose, an I spoke '.wo
and a iirdf hours. 1 havo heard all the?
prominent orators of our own * State. and !
some distinguished rp.-n ol'theoihcr States,
among whom wire \Vol?s:cr and IIjyn
an ! I am constrained to say that although 1
Mr. Memmingcr is comparatively unknoun
to f.imo, I have never 1 slerieJ to any man ;
with more lively interest. I took r:o notes i
of his address and can on y give a faint j
outline of the heads of his argument, and a j
partial shadow of his manner and medio I. :
tie began by expressing himself s'T.si-'
hie of the marked respect which t!:c Ken-j
tucky Legislature had shewn hirn, by permitting
nim to address th?'in in person ; lie j
felt that he was among Kentuckians, who!
had made themselves known for that cour.
tfsy, which, wiulst it distinguished others, I
reflected still greater honor upon themselves.
Me came to a-k their favcruilo consideration
of a subject of eminent interest to the
State of South Carolina. Me came not a
the .-gent of an individual or naniber of individuals,
nor as the organ of a chartered
ci mpany, but as the reprcsenta'ivj of the
republic of South Carol, nu, who by deputing
him to appear before them, designed to
show te Iter sister Kentucky her most d s.
anguished respect, and the intense interest
which s:Pteok in the object of his mission,
lie came not as a messenger of discard,
but of amity : and he wished, before entering
upon the d scuss oa of the subject j
which lie desired io lay before th'-m, (the I
granting a bunk-to aid in making a road i
from Charleston to:h" 0 iio river.) to brush '
away some of the cobwebs which shrouded
the suhji ct. This had been termed here
and elsewhere a scheme of Nuiiflcation?
a design against ihe liberties of the country '
?its end the dissoluiji) of I lie Union?a
s : vera nee of the Sates. I stand here !o re.,
pel the unmanly insinuation with the indig.
nation which it deserves. Thurl back the I
base imputa ion, nnd pronounce it false and i
calumnious. Djring tl;at fearful -crisis,!
wlien tho por:s on the sua coast were manned
with armed soldiers, and the genera
gov rnrnent was hurrying its troops to the
port of Charleston?u lien real or imaginary
oppression, dwelt on by eloquence which
these States have not seen surpassed, had
goaded our people to madness?and the j
knife began to be whetted for civil war, I j
was one of that small ban I who .stood up j
and declared, the Union shall be prrserved.!
If, when ancient walls were bat'ered down, j
'tivns thought glorious to fall 111 the breach, j
I believe it no less the honor and duty of
a good citizen to peril, as Ic'iJ then, his
life for the perpetuity of his country: Such j
was my determination then, when stirroun- j
ded by ditficulties which i.o man hero ca i
conceive, and such are my feelings now, 1 i
am for the Union still, and Heaven I
boars me witness, that I am naw willing to i
lay down my life, ifnecessary, for the lm-j
ion of these Slate, i stand lira re a Car- j
olinian, a Kentuckian, a American?youri
brother?not a foreigner.* Is not that!
{.said Mr. JVJ. pointing to a painting of i
Washington) your father and my father, }
who won for us a common name and a j
common heritage ! Then, in his name 1;
claim brotherhoo J ; and .in his memory (
(nninfinrr ?n I.n F .tv favetto who first set!
loot upon Carolina soil, as lie rushed to j
Dur icseuc, I claim lor us a common sympathy
!
Mr. M. then went on to shew that the rail
road project hail originated else where than
iii Carolina, and that the Unionists in Car.
a!ina were among the first to advocate its
laims. Ho then went into the considera.
ion of the rail road. Was it useful-.,*, was
t practicable ? He proved it practicable
l)y the actual surveys : no ascent from
Charleston to the top of the Alleghany |
nountains being more than 00 feet to the i1
; i
* M'Clung of M'leon, had spoken of the 1
sank ae foreign Ac,
mile, whilst other roads in I he Union were
in actual operation, with grades of upwards
of 60 feet to the mile. The whole road
from Cum Wort to the Ohio, passing through
Lexington,only requiring perhaps, one inclined
piano, with a stationary engine at
the Kentucky river: whilst other roads,
crossing the mountains, required C or 7, or
nine?for instance, the Baltimore and Lliio
Rail Road. He read the report of a distinguishi'd
engineer, shewing that it was tho
:'.s uidl as !lit* lu'?! r_
, r; ? ,rom tno
Atlant c to the Cities of Louisville o, (yincinnati.
We did not (said lie) desert c (ho
n ime of men, and should not be so bold as
to ciuim .brotherhood with the 'other
S a'es, if" m; confessed ourselves unable to
do what thev were doing?or rather, ?f
whilst they climbed the mountains, We
should r.ot he able to moke a road, where
nature seemed to have opened the way for
the very purpose.
Was it useful ? He was one of those
who b -Iieved that no: a sparrow fell to the
ground without Heaven's wiil and he could
r.ot but leg rd the omens of the seasons as,
favoring his project. Your boasted rivers
have been drained, in a manner heretofore
almost unknown by the summer's heat;
whilst they are now locked up by tho/rosta
of winter. Your necessaries of consumption,
salt, sugar and coffee, are 190 per
cent, higher than they are now on the seai'>:
rd?l!;c very breeze, which has, for the
ast four days, been blowing with the warmth
of spring from tbe South, seems to woo you
to her borders, and remind you of our cobimon
<!"stiny and kindred cliine. He contended
that barter was the best trade and
that our live stock coulJ be exchanged tn
the West Indies for sugar and coffee.'That
large numbers of horses and mules were
shipped from the North, to the West
Indies' and exchanged for sugar,
molasses. to the injury of
the sale of K?>tiiij'akv mules and horses, be
? 9
cause the traders of Charleston could not
tai.c g'occri-s?not having a back country
to vend them, unhss by means of a rail
road. He showed that Kentucky bogging
was excluded horn Ids State by the foreign
manufacture, because of the cost of getting
it there ; whilst the planters preferred tho
Kentucky, if they could get it. He demonstrated
to die conviction of all that it w ould
he our in crest to bacon our hogs in Kentucky,
and seed he bacon by the road. He
shewed, from tabular statistics, that the
number ol hogs from Iv nlucky was gradually
diminishing their place being supplied
by bacon from Cincinnati, Missouri, &c.,
lie he lived that fimd'y tho hog would become
ex iuct. Experiment had proved that
Charleston eo;.!d import goods as as cheaply
as New York, having cotton, tho thing
Europeans most wanted, and a port always
free from ice, and safe from the gradual
shoaling ol the backs. Beta r for us to
bring our goods dhce.ly. from Charleston,
wi.h one shipment, than from the East with
a dez'-n by canal. lake, rail road, &c.
Charleston buys all our products, New
York nothing.
He dilated upon the mineral wealth of
the mountains, and up??n the mad, as a
bond of Union. if the i oad was practicable
; end usefuly then the means necessary for
its completion were to he used?A bank
was necessary. T! e long lime before such
a road could return a profitable dividend,
de.erred persons from investing their cap

i bank, they woul i receive an immediate

of the road investment, The Bank
, was then su siJi. ry io the road. Me was of
unpolitical par v? which, was jealous of alt
| bunks although h*: bfliuwd bunks i cces*
|sary in a commercial and civilized community,
he did not know that he should go
for the bunk, if separated from the Joad ;
fur as it was it was dependent upon tho
road. For each share in the bank, tho
s oc kuoMcr was compelled to take substantially
two shares in the ro id ; so that as tho
bank capital increased the road must bo
made, or the charter lorfcited. Ho then
went on t" show that the bank was safe*
and that sijo paper would always be redeemable,
bee mse it was restricted to an
issue of only 82 for one in specio, whilo
others, the most solvent banks, were allow*
od to issue iliree to one?and safe, becr.uso
the whole amount of the rail road stock*
would be double that of the bank stock*
was pledged for t:.e redemption of its issues,
&c. lie explained how the bank would
reduce the present burthensomc rate of
exchange between this and the South ; and
how it would add to the prosperity, by
stimulating industry and develeping the dormant
resources and mh.erai wealth of the
country*
But I weary you with dry enumeration,
fie at length concluded by alluding to the
attempts of designing men in tho North to
injure the cause; by the cry of mad dog;
'twas usual, in such cases, to kill the dog,
and then enquire of it was mad. They
have the same design, by the cry of disunion*
If a road was to be made?forsooth
the Suuth designed ? Southern Confederacy
; if a depressed people be convened
together in a peaceable manner, to consult
about the means of direct importation, and
Southern commerce, to feed the hungry
months and herstarving people, and stay
the tide of emigration, there was some disunion
in it. Was there not some danger
from that quarter, whence there was such
an affected sensibility 1 The times seemr.d
portentous?he wished to bind the Union
by bonds of mu!ual interest and frequent
intercourse?lie now called upon
Kentucky to como forwardi and sustain
her reputaiion for l.beraality and patriotism,
and assist him in making this road* But
if you do not; tf you are blind the mutual
interests which impel us together; if you
steel your hearts against theappeas of a
common danger, and refuse the co-optration
which we invoke, then be it so?I
have discharged my dtrty. -If the cafns^
truphe shall come?If these States shall b*
rest asunder?if the stars and stripes shall
be torn and scattered to the four quarters
of the heavens, and onr once glorious and
