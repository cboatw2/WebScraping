CAPITOL OF NORTH CAROLINA.
Extract from the report rf the Building CoiuV)
issiuncrs.
Til" general design and plan of the 1-uilJ.
i ig is now stl-d. and drawings made out
for t;i" e\i cu ionot die work accordingly, by
w iirii upon examination will be found that
the in criorai rangemen: of is various apartin.mi
s, witli a view to t'ic dili? rem objec's
of the building, are appropria e and harmonious.
O.i the principal ll >or is located ail i
the rooms necessarv tor die at commodation
of tin1 L egislature? in t!:e North end,
the S mi i e chamber?i i the South end, the
hull of t!if House of Commons, \v;:h sni aMe
offices for neir chks ; 0:1 each sale of
tut? passage ways connecting the Porticos
win t'if Rotunda, art: the coinmi tee romn<.
2a t ie Has -incut tae oftie-: s for the ditF lvn:
departments of the State?on the upper
floor, to the East and West centre projcc- ;
tioiis, he Supreme Court and Library 1
rooms; tae former thus situated, will be
removed from the bustle and intrusion, to
which it would be exposed, if placed contiguous
o the pubic Hails ; while the latter
wiil bo suitably retired, and where a height
of ceiling may be auaiurd to admit of the
intro iuciioii of an order of Architecture appropriate
to the objec s oi'these rooms.
Tae great S air ways have prominent j
starting points, at the cmrance of the Porticos
in t.he Bus meats, and an easy and miinterrupted
continuance to tho apartments
and galleries above.
Tiie Board have spared no pains in settling
the plan of this edifice in all its parts,
will) the strictest regard to the principles of
Architecture, and rules of Architectural
taste, in accomplishing this important object
thev iiave been guided by the highest .
pro essional skill, no: even adopting the design
upon the recommendation of .Mr. Pa
ton, our Superiutcndunr, alone (who has displayed
unexampled skill in carrying this
work through nearly all of i s difficult and
most in ricute parts of execution with ex?raordiuary
accuracy and precision.) bu: in accordance
with his wishes, it has been submilted
to Architects of the first charac er,
in the United States, who have examined l
and given their m >st decided approval and
strongly recommended its adoption.
When the building shall have been com.
pie ed as contemplated, notwithstanding its ;
cost will be great, yet taking into consideration
the rock of which it is constructed, is j
out of the States' own Quarry, and the facilities
afforded in its transportation for the j
magnitude of the work, the materials of
which composed, and the style of its execution,
it will be one among the cheapest buildiugs
of its character in the United States,
and will perhaps present one among tiie
finest specimens ot classic taste in Architecture.
Wo have before us a very curious and j
highly important document, taken from the i
London Nau ical Magazne, being the report
of the Committee of the British House
of Commons on Shipwrecks, presented to 1
that body on the 18:h of August last. The
subject had been referred to a committee
with the view of ascertaining whether sucli ,
improvements might not be made in the j,
construction, equipment ana navigation oi
merchant vessels, as would diminish the ,
annual loss of lives and property at sea. ,
The committee having examined documen. |
tarv aud other testimony, returned the re.
port, the substance of which we lay before ,
our readers under a belief that it will be :
found interesting. The total number of
British vessels s randed or wrecked, notice
of which iiitd been entered :it Lloyd's doring
the years IS 16, ?17, and 'IS, was
1114; and during I833, '31, and '37>, lf)73;
the number of vessels missing or lost during
jiie years first named was St), and in these (
Afterwards named, 129?making a to.a! of
s Hps wrecked or miss.ng, during the first
three years, of 1803, and during the second
three years of 1702. Assuming ?5,000
as tiie average value of each ship and cargo
wr<xked, the amount of property losi
would be for the first three years, ?3,015,.
000, being ?2,002,000, per annum ; and j
jn the latter three years, ?8,510,000, or .
?2.835,666. per annum. There were dura);*
;he three vears first named 19 vessels, i
D ?'
and during tiie second tlirec 81, the entire
crews of which were drowned. The num- > ;
her of persons ascertained to have been
drowned during the first period was 1700
and during the second, 1711. Supposing
ten to be the average number of persons on
hoard of -each of the vessels, the entire J
crew s of w hich were known have been lost,
the total number drowned in the first three
vears was 533, which added to 1800, the
exact number known to have been lost,
would be 2228, or 705 per annum; and in
the Inst tiuve ye.ais, reasoning from similar
duta. the total of lives was 2082, or
894 per annum.
It appears that during fie lusi four years
their were 272 vessels lost belonging to ike
port of Tyn?s the tonnage of which was t>0,081
tons, wiiero the whole number of vessels
registered was 1000, being upwards of
one four;!). If it be assumed that these
were total losses, and that the average valwas
?10 per ton, the total loss of property
from tilts single port was ?604,899 sterling,
or, an average of ?151,222 per annum,
while this loss of lives in the same
vessels was 082, the number of widows
und orphans left lor relief 117, and the':
amount of money paid by the Seaman's: .
Association at Shields alone, was ?1,9135. <
Dtrrinjr sixteen months, from Jnmnrv 1
C ' ?
1st, 1333. to M;i\ I t, 133!, the number of
v? ssels i\ {)( )rted ;it LI< yds, c'ni< Hy engaged
in foreign trade as missing or lost, was 9o.
Snerx dn,r ?3000, $'</. 10 I)'.; the lowest
I i r? 7 v
a v rage value of each of these vessels, and
f}i?'V iia 1 1 "> pcr.-ons each on ] oar 1, the loss
of property in t'.mn only, would be ?700,009,
and of lives llgf>. These losses are
said not to embrace the whole extent of loss
by shipwreck, us they nnuvly include those
< nt red at Lloyds, w herons many sliipwreeks
take place of which no notice is taken there..
1 is as incited that the whole loss of Britis'.i
shipping wrecked or foundered at sea,
amounts to nearly ?3,000,1)00 per annum,
and the loss of lives to 1.000 each year,
from which of course increased burthens
arise o the public. What a picture does
this lijrmsh of the < x'ent of calami ies in

and stating that this convention had given
its assent ?o the condition of the act of Congress
above referred to. The President
states that inasmuch as the act of Congress
does not prescribe the mode in which the

TlEiDAY, JAYPARY 10, 1837.
i Rail Road to Ciieraw.?Whilst the most K
i vigorous and praiseworthy efforts arc making y(
1 I' *
. by the towns and communities North and South
of us to increase the elements of their pros- ^
peritv by the improvement of their navigable
waters, and the construction of Rail Roads, jc
no movement lias been made on the subject by (0
Cheraw and its neighborhood. The reason is, \y
that from the comparative disadvantages of w
our location, we saw no prospect of effecting w
any tiling valuable with the means now at our n]
command; and wo deemed it better to make no lu
movement than one that should prove abortive.
But that something must be done for Cheraw, 11
or tint the principal business from which it jj(
now derives most of its support will be directed ^
into other channels, is very certain. What jj,
can be done 1 There can be no doubt, it seems rf
to us, that the main route of traveling1 between di
the North and the South must eventually be til
through the middle or upper country. Char- w
leston and other places on the seaboard route
are often too sickly in the summer season, zc
when travelling is greatest, to admit of its b<
being by that route. Who would risque his *'1
life in Charleston when the yellow fever -3
prevailing in that city ? Besides, the hatard m
of sea navigation from Charleston to Wil- jj
mington would not be incurred by those who
could travel with equal expedition and greater
comfort by land. After, or perhaps before the
completion of the Gaston and Raleigh Rail *\]
Road, it will no doubt be continued South, dr
most probably through Clicraw. The slock m
would, from the amount of travelling on tin cc
road,be as profitable as that of any Rail Road in
the United States. For it is travelling and not
the transportation of goods that renders Rail
Road stock profitable. I f then this road should Wl
be constructed, and cither the Pee Dee should
be property cleared out and navigated with
suitable boats, or a rail road should be constructed
to Georgetown or VVaecamaw, our ^
town would still compete successfully with itj qi
present rivals. pj
We invite attention to the proceedings of Jc
a public meeting at Marion C. H. on this subject,
which will be found in another column, so
We hope the proposed Convention will be well be
attended. It will at least direct public attcn- th
tion to this subject. CI
The Legislature of N. Carolina has elected
Richmond M. Pearson, of Rowan, Judge of
the Superior Courts, and Mr. Gwin, of Macon,
Solicitor of the 7th Judicial District. Mr. \
Holmes having declined the office, there is of
still a vacancy on the bench ; to supply which ci
Judge Toomcr, of Fayettcville, is in nomina- nc
tion. ,
Bills are before the Legislature to make the 80
ar
changes in the charter of the Cincinnati and
w
Charleston Railroad Company, made by the ,
Legislature of this State, and to grant bank- ^
ing privileges to that company. Mr. Mem|
minger, of Charleston, who was appointed by
; the company to attend the Legislature of that
State on its behalf, has made a speech before ^
the Senate which is highly commended,

We had the pleasure, on Monday, to hear c'!
the very able and eloquent speech of Col. ?
Memminger, the delegate from South Caroli- rc
na, on the subject of the Louisville, Cincinnati,
and Charleston Rail Road. We are free to ^
say, our first impressions were against conferring
on the stockholders banking privileges.?
These impressions, however, have been chang-1 pa
ed by the luminous and powerful exposition of wj
Col. M.; and *\ve are prepared to apply our ( fei

Since the above was in type, we have re- j ac

It is an able defence of the amendments of the fri

which we trust will not be unheeded by that an

RAIL ROAD MEETING
AT MARION C. H.
Pursuant fo public notice, a meeting [of
e citizens of the District was held at tho
ourt House, on the 23th Inst, lotake into
jnsideration the practicability of constructg
a Rail Road from the town of Cheraw to
>me eligible point on the Waccamaw River.
The meeting was organized by calling
ic Hon. Thos. Evans to the Chair, and ap.
3inting Dr. R. Harllee Secretary. After
ic objects of the meeting were explained,
ie following preamble and resolutions were
jbmitted by A. Munro Esq., and unanitously
adopted.
Whereas, it is the deliberate opinion of
lis meeting, an opinion based upon a
lorough and intimate knowledge of the
auntry and of its resources, that the conmplafed
plan of constructing a Rail Road
om the town of Cheraw to the Waccamaw
iver, is a measure not only in itself highly
racticable, but when we take into consideition
the wealth and increasing prosperity
t* % % /% .? T
t the principal section ot country tnrougn
hich it must necessarily pass, its comlencement
at the Waccamaw, by far the
Eldest and safest navigable stream ift the
hole S*nte, a s'ream too, which is capable
'admitting at all times, and at all seasons
* the year, up to the very point where the
>nd will commence, the largest class of
?ssels that can cross the Georgetown bar;
3 termination at the public spirited, and
ourishing town of Cherow, together with
ic fact of its being immediately on the main
>u:efrom the City of Washington to Chars'on.
All these considera'ions combine,
render it, in the opinion of this meeting,
?" far the most desirable route for a Rail
ay, of any in the Southern States, and
hich, if carried into successful operation,
lust as a matter of course, produce advanges
to an almost incalculable exent, not
lly to the section of country through which
will pass, but to the community at large.
With the view therefore of directing pub:
attention fo this important enterprise,
Jt more especially of those who reside in
ie several Districts through which the
>ad will have to pass, as^also those resting
cont:guous thereto, and of procuring
icir active co-operation in prosecuting
i-h rtteet this desirable obiecf.
V ^ ? J - ?
Be it therefore Resolved, That the citi.
ms of the Dis'ricts of Chesterfield, Marl.
>rough, Darlington, Horry, and All Saints
arish, are hereby invited to co-operate
it!i the citizens.of this District, in carrying
4o effect the foregoing plan of constructing
Rail Iload from Jtlie town of Chcraw to
e Wnccamaw River: and they arc hereby
spectfully requested to appoint delegate?,
attend a Convention to be held for the
jrpose at Marion Court House, (it being
e most central point,) on the fourth Tuesty
in January next, to deliberate on the
ensures necessary to be taken for its acimplishmon'.
The following rcsolu ion was submitted

A FRIEND TO GOOD ORDER*
Raleigh, Jan. 5.
The following gentlemen have been elected
ounsellors of State for the ensuing two years
esi.s. James Watt, George Williamson,
lien Rogers, sen., Archibald S. Davis, Fran*
s L. Dancy, Chas. E. Johnson and Allen
oodwin; the five first of whom are Van Bunitcs,
and the two last Whigs.?Star.
7rom a Conespondent of the Charletton Conr.
Washington, Dec. 28,1836.
It seems to be settled by the consent of all
rties, that something must be done in the
ly of reducing the revenue. The only dif ence
relates to the manner and the extent.
? *l? cor.Ill tn hp rnnvinmd that
eil WIU V*IIlgo ? --
?re ?ust be reductions to a considerable exit,
to preserve the country from the excite?nts
and discords which must periodically
crue from a constantly accumulating surjs.
The Southern anti-tariff men are for
inging it down to the level of the expend:res
; to which extent they may not be sup*
rted by the co-operation of the whigs. The
ends of the administration are disposed, as
1 as I can gather, in the first instance to
lit the sales of public lands to actual setrs;
and the Committee on Public Lands
; already agreed on the subject of reporting
Bill to that effect. The question is, whether
:h a Bill will pass. It is opposed by the
estern opposition men, but whether it will
by the other branches of the opposition, I
ve not yet ascertained. The effect would
to cause a great portion of the funds which
? now expended for Public Lands, to take a
ferent direction. Instead ofcomiug to the
easury, it would pass into the hands of
?culalors, who hold hundreds of thousands
acres of selected lands in the new countries,
d who would be immediately benefitted by
} advanced prices which these lands would
ng. This, however, would be a small evil,
mpared with the good which might be excted
to result from the reduction of the revue.
If the friends of the administration cant
succeed in getting through a bill of this
aracter, they would probably go for a genii
reduction "of the Tariff, and even if they
5s a Bill to limit, the sales of the Public
nds. thev will be disposed to repeal the du<
