In some cases, Treasury notes are still received,

44THK BRIRKRY BILL."
We copy lite folio wing froin the South
Carolinian of last week:
s' ' * "From the Cheraw Gazette.
uWe learn fiom different sources en.
titled to 'credit, that while the Legible,
turcof South Carolina wan passing a bill
and resolutions to prohibit the State from
receiving it*.ahare of the money, there
was, at the sam * tune, nu understanding
among the members, that if the other j
slates should receive their respective
shares, South Carolina would, in that
case, cake hers also, and risk the subside I
sing influence of the 4 bribe.' "
This poor attempt to belittle the noble
action of this State on'tho vile " Bribery
Bill," is a rank slander upon tnc uegisia. i
lore, and the People, and, so far as we
know or believe, alter daily intercourse
with I|*the. members," during the entire
session, totally destitute of foundation.
AY? solemnly declare, thai we never heard :
'4 single member intimate-the least dr. !
sire, or willingness, that South Carolina I
should hereafter receive any portion allotted
to hnr, or recede in the slightest
degree from the posilion she has taken,
let the course of "the other States" be j
what it may." t
Our information was derived from gefl.
tlemen entitled to implicit credence ; who
held nt least as much *cfaily intercourse
with Mho members/ during the entire .
session": as the editor of the Carolinian '
could have held ; and who were not less J
likely to hear what was said, 01 know
what was intended. The Columbia editor's
testimony is negative, theirs positive,
and both doubtless true.
If "the noble action of thisS'ate on the
vile * Bribery bill/" is itself big, its;
friends need not distress themselves with
apprehensions that shedding upon it a few
rays of the' light of truth can "belittle" it
very mucin*
Our language seems to be misintorpreted
by the Carolinian. The information
which we received, nnrt which we intended
to convey to others was, not that the
course of' other Skites should be looked ,
to as a guide for South Carolina ; hut
that the aim wan to influence uonsrcss,
O T j
with a view of procuring the repeal of the
distribution act; if this could not be done,
and the policy of distribution should be
persisted in, and distribution should actually
be made among the other States,
then, South Carolina would receive her
share. We are not to be understood as
saying there was any formal expression 1
[of opinion on this point, nor that the opinion
wa* universal; but only as conveying
j the impression made upon the minds of
our informants, by casual intercourse with
the members of the Legislature.
We stated a few weeks ago that the
resolutions introduced into the House of
Representatives of this state at the late
session, affirming the right of the Lcgis
lature to instruct the Senators of the state
hi Congress, were aimed at Col. I'kkstow.
The South Carolinian denies that
fhev were thus aimed; and we see, by
looking iho resolutions themselves, thaf
the end expressly avowed was to warn
Senators to Iv idected in future, that the
State insets upfci 'he right of instruction.
The resolutions en,My a curious medlev
