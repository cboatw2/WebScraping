The Metropolitan Rail Road.?We last 1
week published the charter of a company i
for cons'ructmg this road. In the nf cessa-1

office, numerous very awkward typographic :
cal errors occurred in it, as well as in other j
parts of the paper, both last week and the !
week before, but they were no! such as to
prevent the reader from gathering the mean- j
ing from the context. The charier is a good j
' one, and ought to prove, and wo doubt v.of j

after spending several days in balloting for 1
U. S. Senator, in the place of Mr. Rives? ;
whose term vf service expired with the see

the election indefinitely. Messrs. Tyler,
Rives and Ma6on were the candidates first
in nomination. Tyler received about 47 votes
Rives 45 to 50 and Mason 09, for several bal.
lotings. Tyler was then withdrawn, and j
Chapman Johnson nominated; after which

Harder Troubles.?The difficulties bo.
ween the slate of Maine, and the British :
anthorities in Canada on the bo undary question
seem to threaten serious consequences.
The Governor oT Muinc,having ascertained
that mnnv mrsons were ensraned inclining |
a o 9 I
timber on a part of the di-iputed territory^
hi hero under the jrirrsdi lion of Maine,sent :
a confidential communication to the Legis- j
latum, then in session, cotnmurficafcng the .
act, and asking power fori!spt<hnd Agent, j
u put n stop jo the trespassing. The Lo- j
g'slaturo gave him authority to t?r rest,detain ,
and imprison til! persons trespassing on j
the "tori'i'nry of the slate, as established by |
the treaty of 1783." The result is com.
mnnicitcd by ilie governor to the Legisla.
turn, in the following message.
To the rlouse of Roproscn'alives :
In compliance with !ho request of iho j
House of Representatives. I hcrcwi h j
communica'c such information as I have in j
rolation to "the reported abduction of the
Land Agent."
Under the resolve of tbc 24th of January ;
11st. entitled Resolve Mating to tregpassor3 '
upon the public lauds," the Land Agent re. j
paired with about two hun 'red cliosnn men
to the scour of operation on lac Arr.os.!

understood that tho frospassors, amounting J
to about three hundred in number, cdl well !
armed. had combined and were determined 1
i0 resist every effort to break them up.? !
Rinding, bowover, that the Land Agent had ;
prepared himself with a six'.pomuer, they*
chose to retire from the grofind, passing
dowii the rivor. j
The r.and Agent, win his company, also,
passed down f.c Aroostook to near its
mouth, liud ug the several places of opera.'
t on abandoned by the trespassers. On !

t? 1th of January by destroying tho timber
which has already been cut.
J have advised the sending ofu reinforce, j
i
meiit of three hundred men, as it is probable '
the number of the trespassers will bo eon- i
stnntly augmenting?and if a resolve to that,
ctiect he passed, shall appoint an agent to |
supply tnnporar ly the place of Mr. Mcln- i
tire, an-! lead on t.hc expedition. I have ,
a'se despatched a special messenger to Sir 1
John Harvey, I/. Owrr.or of New Brims-'
wick, for the purpose, among other things, of;
of ascertaining whether these highhanded j
proceed ngs ol the trespassers authorized or !
in any ffiiv countenanced by the Provincial ;
< iiivernmcnt; and 10 proccro tbc release of
t Jto Agent and those taken with him. The i
Agent was also charged with other matters j
pf r ainng to this most extraordinary and i
outrageous proceeding.
