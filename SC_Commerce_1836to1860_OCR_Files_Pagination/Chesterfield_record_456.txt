Columbia, Dec. 14, 1840.
Since mv hist, to the present date,
nothing has transpire J of any importance
except the disposition made of the great
nii'itary bill, wnich received its second
reading to-da}r. Sundry amendments
were proposed, as to strike o !f the clao.se
relating to brigade encampments. Tin
excited a warm discussion ; the part.es
in favour of the oil' insisting, that this
was its most inm- r an: feature?that
wit out it, all military spirit must lan.

to be prodigal of either, unless there was
a certainty of receiving an ample equivalent.
Of tin's latter opinion, the House
seemed to he ; for 0:1 the q icstion being
pu% a large majority were found in favor
of abolishing the encampments. It was
also amended, so as to reinstate tne former
company courts martial, instead of the
regimental courts martial, w lich we now
have. Many other alterations were made

it is not certain, that even the substitute

be rejected, so as after all our trouble, to
make no alteration in the law at last.?
Bills of any considerable length, are very
unpopular at this stage of the session,

laid by for consideration, 0:1 the "first

to be the parliamentary time, for deciding

1 family and friends would do well to keep
j in view the solemn warning just &iven,
i that they too may be suddenly called
i hence, that in a little time when least expected
"The Son of man cometh."
