ADDRKSS
TO THE l'FOPLE OF GEORGIA.
I'kkpkkicksb rito, Ya. Aug.29, IS40.
On my way io iht' Indians Springs tn
meet such of my lellow citizens as might
comply with the inviiaiior, to be preseut
tit a dinner to* lie t?> our Nemilnrs J
and three of our Representatives in (Jon-1
grcss, on the 2d of September, 1 am de-j
tained here by a painful disorder, incoin-.
jmtible with the prosecution of aiy j nir-;
m y. In my own judgment, the detention ,
is of no importance except to myself, as 1 I
cannot presume that my presence or ab

opinions anil actions-of any of the j>cr-;
sons who may compose tint assemblage.
I regret-it, nevertheless, as I am deprived
of an opportunity to meet valued friends,
( nil am unable to do ihut which others lor
whom 1 -entertain a strong affection, and
whose prudence and good sense give
weight to^thcir recommendations, have
thought would be t:sefult in the present
agitated state of our country.
I have seen nothing to shake my confidence
in the power of truth; nothing to
make me doubt the futility of all attempts i
to delude the people by ingenious cquivo- .
cations, artful exaggerations, blustering, j
pretentions, or open falsehoods. Whenjl
' iIip- Biiirit nf innin'rv is awakened, llic I,
people are not to bo turned from the pur- i
suit of facts by processions and parades, j
by travelling orators and ballad singers, i
by fiddlings and revelries. A careful in- ?
vesication of those faols, and calm re- I
lleciion upon thcin at home, give to the i
humblest citizcus the power to decide I
wisely in whose hands the Chief Magis \
tracy of the nation can be safely intrusted i
for the preservation of eternal peace, and t
a perpetuation of those domestic inslitu- j
lions with which are-inseparabJy connected 1
the harmony of the Union, and prosperi i
ty, national and individual. These will ?
be used, and being used, the result will c
be right. If it tvere necessary or proper, I
I could bear my humble testimony to the U
fidelity with which the declared opinions, t
?>f the present incumbent have been acted I
upon. Necessary ?t is not. since the chief i
ground of objection to him is, that he has s
performed his engagements, and "fol- t
lowed in the footsteps of his predecessor." s
Proper it will not be considered, as I have \
been intimately associated w iih his ad- t
ministration, and identified in feeling and g
judgment with the great measures of its d
fiscal ami foreign policy, and would lie I
looked upon as a volunteer and interested s
witness. Instead therefore, of speaking c
. tL. ? i _ 1 ? ... i.? ivt. L
wnai I know nun uciiwe in uw jiisi ?i? ju r. , c
Van Burcn nnd of General Harrison, I jr
will use the right of every member of the i
community, to refer to things of common ic
notoriety, which wil! aid my fellow citizens J h
in Georgia in discovering to which of e
these persons they may safely confide the v
Executive power, as it may influence or fi
control the great questions? '1
Of a protective tariff; a
Of Internal Improvements; 11
Of appropriation and expenditure; t!
Of the mode of keeping and disbursing c
the public funds;
01 s^reryv as it exists from the nor- g
tliern confines of Maryland to the Sabine fc
and-Red rivers.. a
(Questions of foreign policy are omit- tl
fed. for, strange to t-y, they are not topics c
in the Presidential canvass, and on that u
subject the advocates of universal reform ci
intend to make no change.) 'i
On these questions /lie opinions of Mr. cl
Van Burcn and Geneial Harrison have p
been in various forms and ut different pe- ci
riods asked for. What ttheir |ans\vcrs w
were, at what time and in what manner u
given, are well known facts. My fellow n
citizens can readily decide, with these fact:! v
in view, which of these gentlemen agrees h
. with them on these important and vital 0
subjects. By comparing the explicit, frank,
pTOBVpi, pUUUC, UUU uiuiurm tuu;iJiuiiii.a-i ^
tibns of Mr. Van Buren, given with like j
readiness to friend or foe, with the reluc- j
tant, equivocal, and not {infrequently con- i
iradictory, givings out.of Gen. Harrison,(j
?sometimes by'reference lo former decla- t
rations, sometimes bv letters from friends !t
and friendly committees, again by speeches jo
at arranged meetings, end thru by private jv
letters for use but not publication?they j c
can/without difficulty, determine which,s
of them deserves their confidence. Should (
any doubt remain, after this comparison, I j
there are two other facts not unworthy to j t
be remembered in forming h correct judgr t
mcnt; Mr. Van Buren has imputed to him c
by his advocates every where, the same j t
opinions and the same principles; the opiti-' ^
ions and principles imputed to (icn. liar- i
rison by his friends and* supporters are a
variant and contrasted?chameleon like, 5
they take their hues from the objects upon l
which they rest, while you arc colled upon i
t.v cxaroinn them, and* show a color to!(
suit.the region where they are presented j?
to view., t
Should the belief be entertained that \
the declarations of the parlies themselves,' i
or those of friends anxious to promote |i
their success, .'trc not safe guides, the mo-ir
tire to concealment, equivocations, or dc-j|
reption being so powerful, try the parties t
by the experiment it in crucis ji
t *i mrintic ciuiimi ,m?rI> Was Jippii lipfiirr- ; i
tli-e public fir inorc than thirty years?.? ';
Compare their professions with their acts,11
and then the results of each couipuiUoii. .1
Jf-atill not satisfied, there are ether broatl
facts? thai I'auuyi fail to bring conviction 1
to the honestly inquiring mind. A better |i
jiitlgincitl of ;ho prohibit coioluet of iinji
administration in this country is to belt
formed by looking at the parties by wiioiuj
it's chief is brought foivt art!, and by ivliotn
he n il! he if they 'Of'ccc.K I ban
\
by a sciutiuy into the particular opinions
and political course of the person who is J s
proposed for llp.t station. Mr. Van Buren s
is the candidate of that party in all the (
States, who under the lead of Gen. Jack- (r
sou, arrested the gigantic and mad schemes ' t
of universal Internal Improvement?who | s
wrested the public money from the hands \
of irresponsible and doubtful corporations, \
and broke their power?who seek to re- t
duec duties and taxes to the wants of the i
Government?and who believe that those 1
wants admit of diminutions of the public ?
expenditure; of a party every where ar.- t
rayed against Abolition, and ready, at all j r
hazards, and at all times, to see that the i
constitutional guaranty of Southern pro-, f
j.c ty is fairly and faithfully maintained. 1
lie is equally acceptable to tbat party in II
the Southern, Western, Eastern, and Mid-:
die Slates?has been forced upon neither
by combinations or intrigues.
General Harrison is the candidate of all
the parties in the United States who can
be brought to act against the present Administration
by the common instinct hatred.
He was forced upon the Southern
portion of these parties by the combina
Lion of Anti-masonry and Abolitionism.
Not one Southern vole was given to him
in the llarrisburg convention. Among
'tis supporters are ranked the high Tariff

The supporters of the General in Gcor- P
ia, 1 need not designate. They are al
nown?what they have been, what they
re, and wliut they wish to he. Sonic of 0
icrn have had, and have lost, popular sl
oufidence; some yet enjoy it; and they ni
nite in their endeavors?the one to rc- ,e
over, the other to retain, popular favor. Cl
'o effect their common object, they are
loscly allied to politicians whose princi- I"
Its they have solemnly rejected; whose hi
nnduct they have repeatedly denounced; "<
hose objects they have always professed *v
) abhor. If there is any truth in the ^
laxini of noscitur a sociis, it will not be rt'
cry difficult to decide, from this array of
is friends, what reliance can be placed 01
n Gen. Uariis in by Georgians. g1
Tlie only Chief Magistrate to whom the
iouthcrn States can safely trust themselves 'J1
s one who will .use the influence of his ^
dace wisely to lead congressional legisla- '
ion on the subjects that must arise fur 11
liscussion '.vithin the coining Presidential '1
crm?the apportionments of rcprescnta- a
ion, the system of revenue, the admission v
if new Slates into the Union; and one who al
t ill use his power fearlessly and fully to g
ontrol all attempt at legislation on that l'
uhject which is conclusively Southern. 0
)u litis there can be no parley, for it adnils
of no compromise. Those who agi- 11
ate it, do evil, whatever he their pre- <"
enrcs or their motives. Those who usso- ?
iatc, combine, and act with those agita- l'
ors, must look to have the finger of sus
ticion pointed at litem. No Southern '(
nan, who will read dispassionately the d
iddress to the people of the slave-holding u
stales, and the accompanying evidence, it
rurn the Democratic members of Conn-ess
from those States, can have nnv
:xcusc for mistaking his ilutv, when hej
icts on this question. To the iiubodicd :
tvidcnce presented of tlic movements:
vithin the United States of the disturbers j
?f Southern repose, may be usulully ad-1li
led a reference to what is going on abroad.. "
The Government of Great Britinn, which j b
tas always permitted the Canadas to be i''

ndics has diminished the productive vaue
ol their West India islands, in demising
schemes to giv c a present prefer;nce
in their markets to the productions
>f free labor, (like that in British India!]
mil gradually to exclude from them the
iroduets of the- labor of slaves. Of the
em per and intentions of the agitators ol
he question of slavery, and the means to
>c employed, abundant evidences are tillered
in the proceedings of the ' World's
Convention,, which met in Loudon on
he twelfth, and continued until the tweny-lhird
of last June.
Ttvo rssolulions were unanimously
dopled, too significant to require much
omment. Those resolutions denounce
lie removal of slaves from the old to the
iew States as an unrighteous traflic, of
rhich eighty thousand are annually \icims;
as exciting detestation. Surprise
nd abhorrence arc acknowledged, that
t should be protected and cherished by
his Government. That it involves hardicss
of heart in the traders, and cruelly
o the negroes; is asserted;.and that cfl'ecual
means should be immediately taken
o remove this stain from the character
f this nation. Was there ever such a
otnpound of ignorance, folly, and insotjnee?
The brutal O'Conncll was quite at
oine in such a convention; and liis inulis
to the representative of a Foreign
iovemmcyl near his own, his vitupcraion
of two of our eminent public men;
a re quite in harmony with the occasion,

fiectual means ought to be taken in the

leans? We can guess. First, prohibition

laves by land or by sea, from one Stale
) another; next, a prohibition of the

| Execution of Major Andre.?Duct.
IIall,x>f East Hartford, a surgeon in the
, army of the revolution, was mi eye witness
to the execution of Major Andre,
, standing within four or five rods of the [
I scene. Noticing some inaccuracies in the ]
i article w*o published from the Kuicker-!
boekcr a few davs atro. be has called and I
f CI ' 1 j
j related to us ..the following particulars. ]
I lie states that Andre walked to the place
i of execution behind the cart, aceompa:
nied by two officers, one on each side,
and stepped under the gallows. Arrived
'there he stepped into the cart, when the j
the officer of the day, Col. Seammcll, said
to him, if you have any thing to say, you j
now have an opportunity. lie replied 11
have nothing to say, but to have you bear,
witness that I die like a brave num. Col. j
S. then said to the hangman, do your duty.
He went to work so awkwardly in attempting
to put the noose ovei Andre's neck,1
that Andre took it from him and made an
efiort to do it Inmwclf. But his hat bring
in the way. he let go the rope, took ofl'his
hat. and stock and laid them on the coffin,
and unbuttoned bis shirt collar and turned
I it down. He then put the noose over his'
: head, and adjusted it to his necli, took out
1 of his pocket a white handkerchief, with'
wh'cli he bandaged his evos; and a blue
O ? '
ribbon, which lie handed to the exccu- (
tioiicr, requesting him to lie his hands behind
him. This being done, Col. 8cam-\
J niell directed the cart to be driven away,
i Andre was a small man and seemed hardI
Iy to stretch the rope, and his legs dangled,
I so much that the hangman was ordered
! to take hold of them and keep them,
I straight,. The body was cut down after |
i hanging fifteen or twenty minutes, and
I buried near the gallows. From the locaI
tion of the grave, Andre must have passed
I it in going to the place of execution.
! The Doctor thinks the account relative
! to the attempts made by Washington to J
secure Arnold and liberate Andre, must,
' be incorrect. The L art which sentenced '
| Andre to death having been held on the
29th September, only three days before
| his execution, the time allowed was not
tby any means sufficient to permit such1
(plans lobe successfully carried out,
I peeially the one in which Champo was
said to have been concerned.

of our readers to it. It is an able, dignified
document, and"although addressed to the Georgians'

REGIMENTAL REVIEW. , .
On Saturd 'V last, the 2Qd Regiment of Sooth ' l
Carolina Militia, under the command of Col. IIailk,
; were reviewed in this town.
i Tho Regiment turned out as numerously, as wo
have seen it for tome years, and we are pleased to /
' learn, from those well qualified to judge in such mat,
tors, that the evolutions ptformcd or. the occasion, '
' were executed in a manner highly creditable to tho
: ofiiccrS and mon.
I Tho nppcarar.ee, for the first time, in Full uniform,
I of the DlKa lb Rifle C carps, added greatly to the
I _r .i._ i ur..?
i ihluicfcl ui luu lu'fiuwt ?? o uuvv p|*vo,vii v*
i the zeal with which the members of this company
were preparing themselves for the performance of
duty; and their splendid appearance on Saturday,
far surpasse d all our anticipations. The uniform is
not only neat, but elegant, and the precision with"
which their movements are tirade, would reflect
honor on older soldiers; we doubt if there could
bo belter.
The company [consists of about one hundred men, '
and we question if there is to be found in the State
a corps, wk-ro more of the truo military spirit
exists, and which is making more rapid improve,
ment in the performance of all the duties which go
to make up a well organized and well drilled volun.
tcer company.
Tiiom..s S. Anderson, Esq. one of tho members,
was elected, previous to the dismission of the corps,
to deliver the first Anniversary oration.
Abolition.?The recent excitement in the South,
cm portion of Virginia, adjoining North Carolina,
on account of the discovery of a contemplated insurrection,
and the more serious demonstration in
Louisiana; the former of which Was strongly bus.
peeled to have been urged on by fanatical cboli.
tioiiists, and the latter known to be, admonishes tha*
whole South to be upon the alort. Every town and
village should be prepared to protect themselves
promptly, froin the evils which may be brought upon
llicm, by the insidious movemonts of these raving
philanthropists. This suirceslion applies to no place.
with which we arc acquainted, more strongly, iliajj
to Camden.
The organization of the Dt-K.u.n Rifle Guards,
at this juncture, has presented to our mind a plan
which we thii:k could not fail to meet the views, of
the public spirited Captain bf that corps, and road'u
ly adopted by its patriotic members.
I.et a portion of them, particularly those who
rcsido within the limits of thejCorporation, be organized,
as an alarm guard, -and in c^sc of any alarm,
let them repair promptly, armed and equipped to
a regularly appointed rendezvous, in some central
position, which shall be known to all our citizens.
Should the alarm proceed from fire, they may per.
form good service in protecting the proporty which
may be saved from its ravages; and if it should arise
from any thing more serious, they will be equally
prepared for the emergency-. The details of the
arrangement, will readily suggest themselves; we
merely throw out the hint, and trust that it may bo
acted 011. The Guards have already won the admiration
of all our citizens; they may yet entitle them,
selves to their gratitudb.
Mai>e Election.?It is impossible to ascertain
ns yet the truth in relation to the election for Governor,
and Members of Congress in Maine. Both
parlies claim llic victory vr\l\\ respect to the choice
of Governor. We are inclined to the opinion however
that 110 election has been made by the people.
IVe think it probable tjiat the Whigs have a majority
in both branches of tlio Legislature. IIow the
delegation to Congress will stand, is yet uncertain,
though it is likely they will have the majority there
also. If the fact should be so, .there can be no
doubt, but it will be found to arise from the zeal
with which the abolitionists entered the contest.
Here, as in Vermont, their whole force has been
rallied for-the purpose of defeating tlio democratic
republican party.
Interesting to the Ladies.?"We notice in oor
