A dose of castor oil should be given four or fire
hours after the first dose of calomel ; the subsequent
doses, if they operate, may be suffered

Pain or griping daring the operation of medicine
Ought always to be allayed by laudanum, in do9cs
of 15 drops as often as necessary. When the
medicine is not oporating, tenesmus or griping
may be eubduod by injections composed of 30 or
40 drops of laudanum in a wine glassfull of
starch.
If there is mach pain with fever and lonse
pulse, blood should be drawn till the pulse is
softened.
The drinks during the troatmcnt ought to be
mucilaginous; such as benne tea, flax seed tea,
a solution of gum arabic, or a tea from the pith
of sassafras bushes, or the bark of slippery elm.
If at any time during the progress of the
disease the lower part of the abdomon wiil not
bear pressure without pain, it is time to be
seriously alarmed. If a ph} sician cannot be had,
bleed as copiously as the puSe will bear, blister
over the seat of tenderness, give 3 or 4 grains of
calomel with one and & half grs. of ippecaccuana
every two hours, as long as it does not operate
too freely on the bowels; and repeit the lauda.
Bum and starch injections as often aa may be j
necessary to prevent much griprogvboi not oftener.
If the email doees of ippecacuana are thrown
up, lessen the them. If they are stiU thrown up,
omit them, and give the calomel alone.
The reader will bear in mind that dysentery

The body of a man who had been hung in
New York was subjected soon after to gal.
vanic experiments, the results of which are
stated in the North American as follows.

Physician of the prison.
These experiments were performed by Drs.
Horner and Mitchell, aided by Dr. Hare, a
full and accurate account of which will be published
in the Electeric Journal of Medicine for
September, edited by Dr. Bell, who was present.
This battery was one of the most powerful
ever used in this country, and every thing connected
with it had been arranged with the
Sa test care, important results were confitly
expected from the experiments to be
made with it.
Upon first applying galvanic power to the
surface of the body, a natural respiration was
produced, with the usual audible sounds accompanying
it, and upon after examination,
several physchns present were of opinion
that if the body had been obtained ten minutes
sooner, and freely bled, with the application
of the galvanic power, it could have been re-,
stored to life.. The application of the hattety ,
to incised parts of the body and the nerves,
appeared not to be more powerful, (if as much
so) as the outer skin.
Sparks of electricity from the galvanic battery,
perceptible to all present, were discharged
Upon the body several times during the experiments,
which several medical men present
informed us that they had never witnessed before,
in similar application^.
When galvanic influence was directed to
the extremities th?ire was strong muscular
contortion produced, bnt nothing equal to what
has been frequently witnessed m other instances.
The artns were raised and thrown over
the chest, and the fingers contracted and exCAnded,
but with none of that violence that
sb been looked for. When the force of the
battery was applied to the face, all the mus*
cles in that region were thrown into action,
but even here the effect was not very striking.
EieCtromagnetism was also applied but without
success, as ne sensible impression was exhibited.
Upon an examination of the neck, It was
found that it bad no been dislocated in the fall,
which Was three feet, ror had the spinal marrow
received any injury.?He therefore died
from strangulation, u hich gave cause for the
opinion above expressed, that his body could

His body was much emaciated* and upoU
examining his lungs, several la^ge tuberces
were found, the effects of which would soon

NEW LIGHT FOR LIGHT HOU8S8.
A tetter of the 10th nit* from Trieste, |
states that a new system of producing lighthouses
has been invented by a seijeani major
in the Austrian artillery, named Selcknoeky*
The apparatus consists of a parabolic mirror,
62 inches by 30, with a 13 inch focus, and the ,
light is produced by a new kind of wax candle,
invented by M. Selcknosky. It has been tried
under the inspection of the Austrian Lloyd's
Company, in the port of Trieste, by being
erected on the mast of a vessel. The light is
said ro have illuminated the whole of the port
and the surrounding parts of the town equal to
the moon at full \!)? and at the distance of
600 yards the finest writing can be read. A
second trial has been made in bad weather,
and the result wag proportionably favorable.

We learn from Governor Lucas and another
gentleman, who came passengers on the
lone last evening, that two hundred and twenty
Indians were killed in the upper country

on the pmt of the Sioux. While they www
thus peaceably encamped, they were surprised
by the Sioux, who commenced their butchery.
They immediately rallied, but before the bah*
tie terminated, the Chippewa* lost one hundred
and fifty at the Fall* and twenty on the
St. Croix. The number of the Sioux killed on
the occasion amounted to about fifty; We do
not much wonder at the hostility that'has been
exhibited by the Sauk* and Foxes against the
Sioux, if this latter tribe has always been as
treacherous as they were on 1 he above occasion.

The harvest, wherever it has taken place,
has proven abundant, far beyond that of date
years. In Western New lork, it is said .to
exceed all precedent. In the Scioto valley
(Ohio) more wheat has been gathered than
for any year for twenty years past. In Pennsylvania,
Maryland and Virginia, the formers
have reason to be truly thankful for the abun

their labors. In short, every where,

The question of the power of the Governor

by the Supreme Court of Illinois against
the power of the Governor.
During the last session of the Illinois Legislature,
Governor Carlin, thinking to turn
Mr. A. P. Field, the Secretary of State, out
of Office, nominated in his place Mr. J. A.
McClernand. The nomination was laid before
the Senate, but that body decided that the
Governor had no right to create a vacancy by
by turning out Mr. Field. A bitter controversy
ensued between theSenate and his Excellency,
and was kept up during the rest of the
session. After the adjournment, the Governor
again assumed the prerogative of appointing
Mr. McClernand to the Secretaryship, and
that individual attempted to take possession of
the keys and papers, but Mr. Field refused to
give tnem up. The case was brought before
the Circuit Court, which decided that Mr.
McClernand was actually the Secretary.?
Field appealed to the Supreme Court, and
that tribunal, the highest in the State, harnow
reversed the decision of the lower Court, and
decided that Field is the Secretary.

The Army and Navy Chronicle notices a
story which has obtained general circulation,
founded on a letter from Washington, publish,
ed originally in the Charleston Courier, and
copied extensively into other papers. The
amount of the story is, that an individual in
Washington has offered to mako disclosures in
consideration of a pecuniary compensation for
himteli and pardon for a friend, that the Horn*
et survived the gale in which she is gentrxlly
believed to have been lost and was subs*,
fluently destroyed by conspirators, bribed by a
foreigh Government!
The Chronicle says *?that there is so individual
in Washington who has offered to make
such disclosures, is true enough ; but that any
faith as placed in his pretended story* or that
it lias led to frequent and long deliberation,'
i utterly untrue. The individual in question
has been convicted of a criminal offence, and
probably hoped to escape punishment by pretended
revelations of the fe e of a gallant vessel
and her crew, whieh must remain shrouded
in mystery until the day of judgment.?

SriANOC OCCURRENCE.
Amongst the apparently endless catalogue
of strange occurrences and crimes with which
the press has teemed, the following, which has
been communicated in a letter from a lady re
siding near the scene of action to her friend
in this vicinity, is a little the strangest we
have met with. Not having seen the letter,
we are under the necessity of giving a second
hand account of the affair, and may consequently
be in accurate in some of our details ;
but the substantial facts are as furnished to
us, Being personally acquainted with the
writer of Die letter, we have no hesitation in
expressing our belief of her statements. Here
is the strange tragic I ale .*??
Some time sinee the sheriff of a county in
the southern part of Mississippi had received,
in his official character, a large sum of money
?eay fifteen or twenty "thousand dollars. Under
pretext of a call from home for a day of
two, he placed the money in the keeping at f.is
wife, whom he charged to take good care of
it.
Late in the evening of the day on which he
left home, a stranger of genteel appearance
called at the house, and asked permission to
remain over eight. Disliking to entertain a
stranger during her husbands absence, the
wife of the sheriff denied the request, and the
stranger rode on. Directly after his departure,
however, the lady came to tho conclusion
that she had done wrong in refusing to take
him in, and sent a servant to recall fern. The
gentlemaii returned, and soon after retired to
rest. 4 Late
in the night, thfe men disguised as
negroes, came to the house called up the lady,
ana demanded possession of the money left m
her charge. Believing that there was no help
for ??be at length tnld.lhasi tkit the renasy.
wis in another room, and that she would go
and get it for them.
It so happened that the money had been deposited
in the room occupied by the stranger;
and on her going for it she found him up and
loading his pistols. He had been awakened
by the noise, and had overheard most of the
convertatioa between his hostess and the rob*4
bete
Telling the lady to be of good heart, he gate
her a loaded jpistol and instructed her to go
out and present the money to one of the robbers,
and to shoot the fellow whilst in the act
of doing so?on her doing which, be (the stranger)
would be ready for the other two'
With a coolness and courage that it is difficult
to conceive of in a woman, she did as di|
reeled, and the robber who received the money
foil dead at her feet. Another instant, and the
strangers bullet had floored a second robber.
The third attempted escape, hot was overtaken
at tl?e gate by the stranger, and fell
under the thrust of his knife !
As sooo as practicable, the neighbors Were
alarmed, and on washing the paint from the
faces of the dead robbers, the one killed by the
lajy proved to be her own husband, and the
other two a couple of near neighbors 1
Such is the story, in substance. As before
stated, it comes in a letter from a lady for
whose credibility we are willing to vouch. If
error exists in the statement, either the writer
of the letter was misinformed or we have
been most egregiously hoaxed. s
