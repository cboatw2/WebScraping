EXECUTIVE DEPAR I'MENT,
COLUMIA. Nov. 28, 1843.
Gentlemen of the ,enaet and House oJ Rep
resentatives:
Since your adjournment the late long
continued depression of 6nancial affairs
throughout the world, has reached and
passed, what we have much reason to
believe, was its final crisis. During the
last Spring pricesof every description fell
to the lowest point ever kniwn. but have
since continued -teatlily. though gradual
ly to advance. The revival of business
has been the effect of acci'cutal causes,
or speculative operation, or expansion of
the paper currency: nor is it uwiug to .,n)
act of legislation in any part of the worbd
favorable to trade. It has been te t.tur
al result of industry, economy, and tune.
which has swept oil a large proportion ol
the embarrassments created by ho disas
ters of the past. and accumtulated at ail
the greatcommercial points. in safe hands,
a vast and on:xatpled atmiout of -,ojund
metallic capital. We have 'beretott' iood
reason to indulge the hope that it will be
permaneir., and to felicitate ourselv.as ou
the dawn of a new era in trade and fin
ance.
There is but one serious obstacle now
apparent that can arrest and roll back in
any short period, the retut uitng tide of our
prosperity, and that is, the narrow and
delusive idea which still seents to prevail
wih a majority of those who rule the
world, that th. y can promote the interest
of their respective countries, by fettering
trade and building up monopolies. Until
we seriously approximate to universal
Free Trade-to an unrestricted exchange
of the surplus production of our country,
for the surplus of another, by which bneans,
the wants of all will be supplied in the
cheapest manner, and commerce, curret
cv, and credit established in natural and
enduring channels, the periodical recur
rence of speculations, fluctuations and dis
asters, that will convulse the world, must
be looked for with perfect certainty.
It is a matter of congratulation, that
England, the source and centre from
which have directly or indirectly sprung
nearly all'the great improvements of mod
era times, has given evidence of a serious
change on this great question. Her re
cent legislation has been decidedly direct
ed tow ards a relatxation of hter proihibit ary
and protective laws. Ir is to be regretted,
at the same time. that .iearhy every other
important power itt Euroipe, has within a
few years past, in its convulsive efforts to)
throw oil thte emibatrrassiments of the
times, increased restrictions Upon01 trade.
Whilst our own Govertunent, rectirring
to that policy which is every where else
regarded as the most odious features of ar
istocratic and despotic power, and held itt
abhorrence by the p ople, has re-ettacted
its Tariff laws, and made them more rigor
ens and oppressive than they have ever
been before. That a Government like
ours, purportiong to be based on perfect
freedom and equaltty, shoiuld perpetrate
such laws; and that a people so itntelligent
as ours-so oistrustful of their rulers-so
ready to resist irnjustice, and oppression,
four-fiths of ti hunm are agricniturists, all
-deeply injured b3 r- strictionts upon flrign
ommerce-should pertmit such an execra
besystem to be fastened on them, is one
of the most extraordinary evetnts in rte
history of the age. To the etnlightetned
views so rapidly gaihering trotud attirng
those who conirul the English Govertinent
--to the progress of' trtte knowle-dge a
rnong~ the other States of Eturope, and to
the change of power into other hunds,
wiich is just about tt lbe realized int onr
country, I look with confidence for a vast
amelieratton and early abandonmenit of
thie whole system of protective duties.
in the mean ainme it should be borne
constantly in mind, that any departure
from the great principles of industry, e
conomy, and a steady faith, that with the
practice of these two cardin'al virtues,
time will do the rest, must be attended
withithe most serious consequenices to our
future welfare." And perhaps tno occasin
could be more auspicious thiani the pt esent,
for yous to institute a close and searching
examination into the precise condition of
our State. in all its departments, and in
troduce such alteatnsn and reforms as
will enal le her to take the tide of prosperi
ty to most advantage, and maintain it
longest.
H'er financial condition claims. perhaps,
at this especial moment, your first atten
tion. The pub'ic debt of the State may
he put down in round numbers at three
millions and a half of dollars ($3,300,000)

The character of the people of our State is ale
opposed to extensive speculations. and perhap
no where in the world is a default in a publi
trust regarded with such universal and utte
abhorrence. All these necessary elements o
past success cannot be expected to co-exist for
ever. As men, we may be permitted to indulgp
the hope that they may. As Legislators, yon
would be forgetful of history ai.d human natur
to calculate upon it. Was it now an origins
questiun. few voices I apprehend would bi
found in favor of a Bank of the State. Havin
run a career of thitty years, might it not be wit
to apply at this time an active and searching
test to its success and soundness But tit
much depends upon the fact.jo admit of mue
longer delay in ascertaining it beyond all qines
tion - Nor is it a mttter for less grave consider
ation, whether the State is to hurtow monety
fotevet, itn order to loan it out at tite same, or
nearly the same rates of interest, subject to all
the expenses, fluctuationsand disasters of Bank
ing-a hustness which otall others has proved
the most uncertain and ruinous to States and
individuals.
The strongest objection that I see to the plan
I have sugges'ed fir the speedy payment of
the Public Debt, is the doubt whether the Stdte
Stock can be purchased to such amounts at
par. Within the next seven years however,
nine hundred and sixty thousand dollars ($9,60,
0011) of debt will be redeemable, at par. Of
the Stock now held by the Bank, there was on
the 30th September, certainly sixtv-four thou
sand dollars (64.000,) perhaps more, not re
deemable within that time. but already obtained
at par. A million more, redeemable in 1860,
in held int Europe, and is there guoted below
par, though it is a. matter of pride for us to
know that it stands higher than the Stock of
an y othet State, save one. In the present con
dition of Ametican credit abroad. this Stock
niight probably be purchased at pat. Could
so much he obtained, four-sevenths of the. debt
n onld be extinguished, and time and circum
:tanes might place the balance within reach.
Ott most of these Stocks the State obtained a
premium, and it would not be unfair for her to
pay a similar one to redeem thea.
Should the attempt to purchase all the debt,
however. fail, the next best that could be done,
short of actual payment, wouhl be to shitl the
bnlance of it on the other Statea of the Union.
by purchasing the S:ocks of such es are nn
doubtedly sound. nttd faiuht'ul to their engage
ments. It is not probable that anu abundance of
suh stocks may nat be obtained at any time
within the next seven years. below par. And
provisit might he made ftir procuring them

If the scheme I have recommended f.r pay.
iig the debt of the State should not meet your
approbation, it seems to me important that you
shotul at least make ariatugemetnt for a Sinking
Fund in fact as well as in name. The fmnid
now distinguished by that name, does inot differ
practically, im the shlightest respect. fron any
pa rate item in the hooks of the Batik ; the sur
plus profits are nominally turned over to it,
and the interest of the State Debt subtraccted
from it. But to keep nIp this distinction is :all
unnece.sary labor, since the whole fund is
henned out precisely on the same terms as the
other Bantk funds. The fiuudamental principal
of a real Sinking Fund is enmpounding ititer

that itis wholly inadeqgnateto defray the ordi

Notwithstantding a simnilaer balance reported to

r Among the undrawn appropriations. is the

- which was at your last Sessioni'with the~ pro

forservice. And the Federal Government:an.
nually i nishes a quota of arms valued at fromi
six to eight thousand dollars. This quota is
rated in muskets.- but by a provision in the.
Aet of Congress, these may be commuted, a
npplication of the Executive of the State. for
other arms and equipments. A judicious use
of this resource will enable the State always to
keep up a proper assortment of munitions of
war without the expenditure of a. dollar. -
have this year'taken advantage of it, to equip
the Marion Artillery Company in Charleston..
by commuting about a thousand dollars which
would otherwise have been expended out ofits
appropriation. I recommend that the appro

In his last Annual Message, my immediate
predecessor urged on you the necessity ofa re1
organization of the Executive Department of
the State I invite you to a re perusal of his
remarks In all that he has said,.I give my
entire and cordial concurrence, and earnestly
recommend a serious consideration of the sub'
ject. I think, too, that a reorganization of alt
the- offices connected with the Executive De -
parttnent is asimperatively required.' The cir.
cumstances which led to a division of them,
between the seat of Government and the City -
of Charleston having ceased to exist,. the divi-.
sion should cease also. The Rail Road har
brought them so near together that tliey might
be re-united with little inconvenience toany
one, and tmnch to the advantage of the State at
large. There can be no necessity for two Treas
surers within six or eight hours ride of each
other. There is very is little, if any ungranted.

he should be fixed near it. The private re
