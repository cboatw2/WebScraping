lie VEGETABLE ELIXIR. This medicine is
composed of Roots which grow in this State. It is
ageless to enter into a detail of the value of this Medicine,
(or any other Root medicine,) as it is well
known that all Roots have valuable Medical pro- ,
perties. lie would also state that there is n<>t the
least dangor in the use of the Elixir. For the following
named diseases, there is no medicine made or
trended at the present time, better calculated to relieve
:,he afflicted, than the Vegetable Eli\ir. >
For Rheumatism and Consumption, the Elixir j
diould tie used internally and externally.
For Dyspepsia or Dysury, he would also recommend
the use of the Elixir, as he feels confident
it will prove highly beneficial to those who use it.
To th>>su who are afflcted with Pustules, Eruptive
Distempers, and Venereal diseases, he particularly
recommends the useofthe VEGETABLE LLIXIR.
Without the fear of contradiction, he recommends this
Medicine as the rest now in use?as it has proved

TI1E success of the SOUTHERN TONIC is
unprecedented. It has been anxiously sought '
after by all persons in every port of the United
States, and its widely extended distribution has
been owing to the many requests received from |
every section of the South and South West* Al- j
though it originated in an obscure p rt of the coun- ' j
try but a few years since, it is now found in all the
principal towns and vitiligos in the Union, and its
virtuis as a cure for Ague and Fever, and as a
general Tonic, are appreciated by al' who have
used it Being as it professes a compound of ,
Southern Vegetables, it is needless to offer the as- j
suraucc that there is no Arsenic,Mercury, nor any
thing in the least hurtful to the human constitu- y
tion in it. It will be found a valuable Medicine
in all cases of Dyspepsia and disorganised Stomach j
and Bowelsl and patients convalescing from I il- ^
liou*. Fever, will derive the most important benefits
from the use of the Southern Tonic. It may j
be administered to children and infants of the most <

PATENT COTTON Slit. I
rnp Ills Gin can be made double, or single. If 1
made double, they reduce labor, and gin just "
dduhle, the quantity of cotton over the single cylin- :
dor Gin, no other kud having been in use prevous !
to this patent; and whether single or double, they '
are found to improve the quality of the cotton, by k
more perfectly cleaning it. They can be made to
contain from 20 to 1G0 saws in a stand, and whether
small or large, oho hand will be sufficient to attend j
them. The Gins have mechanical feeders and
hoppers attached to thein, which .free the cotton
Irom leaves, trash, dirt, &c. before it can teach the
saws, and by the thorough hnckling operation it;
receives from the feeders, which make two revolutions
to one of llic saws, it is almost in a half *
gined state, before it descends to the saw By a'
very simple arrangement of a screw to each set of I
gnates, on which the hoppers rest, a"?I through '
which the teeth of the feeders pass, thej' can oe i *
made to teed slow or fast to suit the condition of|
\]\fk pAltnn ni tlio #?mo WK??* J Ll " *

saws are placed on two seta of cylinders and turn *
upon <-acl? other in opposite directions, and are' _
cleansed bv two setsot brushes that have fourrevo. j *
lotions to one of twe saw. The two cylinders can |
be detached so as to enable the planter to run one
or both at pleasure, although embraced with feeders, *
&c. in onp stand.. The whole is put in operation [
with a drum and band, as in the ordinary Gin, and
may be propelled by horse, strain, or water power. *
It may also be propelled by iron running gear.
The force required to work it, is about the same as *
that necessary to move an tqual number of saws in
the common Gin. This Gin has been put in *
operation in New Orleans for two or three weeks,
and its success tested in the presence of a Targe
number of planters, merchants aiid others, and a
received their general approbation '
Several gentlenu n have been so kind as to give
the Patentee their written opinion lespecting the 81
merits of the Gin. A number of others could be
added, but the following are deemed sufficient: ?
