ANTI-SUSPENSION LAW. c
Judge Boiler has delivered his opin- Hton
in the case of the State vs. the B ink of c,
* . South Carolina, on the scire facias, rcquir- w
' ing.jhe Bank to show cause why its cliar- it
*" ter should not be forfeited. The opinion l'
of the Judge oc..'pies three columns of i
the Courier, of Monday morning, and ofj
iv, course cannot be copied into the Journal I
of to-dav. His Honor has decided that n
s fi
the suspension of specie pavments, per se,
s no cause of forfeiture <?fu Bank charier. ^
The At orney General on the part nf the a
' State has appealed from the decision of n
JuJgc Bmler. ;d

' The business -of Congress is now progressing rapidly,
-apd .the Session will doubtless so??n bo brought
?, to a cles?. . Notwithstanding all the hopes wo had sl
a: ^ entertained of the defeat of the Bank bill in the "
Sp>iate, we are reluctantly obliged to announce that
it hast passed that body by a majority of one vote.?
This result was produeed by one of Mr. Clay's n
"compromises." The bill will unquestionably pass s
the House* and probably rccoivo tho approbation of ^
the President, so that wo shall have a Bank. Tho *
Senate have also passed a general Bankrupt hill, Vl
arid itis stated th,t there is very little doubt Imt the 11
0-;'? "?!11 jilso adout it. TiiiS measure was not si
XJlVUov u... ? ,
originally in tho programme of the extra Session, c
and we feared would be overlooked, but in this we 0
rejoice to find oursclf mistaken. We shall look upon r'
tho passage of a Bankrupt law as one of the most 0
beneficial acts of the Session, and in fact the only v
act now under consideration, upon which the pco- v
pie have expressed an opinion. The biil to arm and c'
P equip a Home Squadron, which has passed the r
House, is an excellent beginning to strengthen our c
Navy which wo hope will be followed up, as our fi-!
nances will porrnit.
Tbc success which has attended Mr. Clay's cf;;forts
in pushing his Bank bill through the ticnato, (
^v_' loaves us no ground to hope that any of the great t
whig measures, as they are termed, will fail. The |
party have tho power in their own hands, and they |
seem determined to wield it. .
.'The Session, it is thought, will be brought to a |
close by tho middle of the present month. (
' j
Tbc following is the vote, in tho Senate, on the (
passage of tiie Bank bill, from which it will be seen, i
that we are, indebted to Mr. Preston, who has so (
.long misrepresented South Carolina, for tho success
of a measure, which his Slato has almost unani-j
mously condemned. Had South Carolina been fuily
represented, in the Senate, the bill would have been <
- . defeated. ,

MESSRS. clay AND BRENT. ]
The Washington Globe, of the 23J ult. contains a j
Card of Col. w. l. Brknt. in relation to the appoint, a
meat of tho District Attorney for the District of Co- v
lumbia, which places Mr. Clay in rather an unenvi- j
able attitude. ; f
It scorns that Col. Brent had boon promised, by /
Gen. Harrison, the office of District Attorney, and P
that mr.-Clay had, in conversation witn Col. b., j,
T remarked tbatif he "had the giving of the office lie i
would oflcr ft to him in preference to any other, if 1
" : Gen.yWcs would not accept it," and th t in a subsc? v
quent conversation, when it was known that Mr. s
' Kendall (who hassinco been appointed ) would be \\
' \Tr r. Av nnsitirolv an- |
an appuc-mi ipr mo viuw, ..... .. r ?
gurod Col. Brent that he could not, und would not, I
r interfere between them, both being personal and po- a
; litical friends of hie. Yet notwithstanding these i:
; conversations and assurances on the part of Mr. O. ll
to Col. B., it scetns that he did interfere so far as to n
address a strong le'tcr of recommendation in favor of I)
"j.? * Mr. Fkndall to President Tyler. si
It is this duplicity on the part of Mr. Clay which ii
Mr. Brent's Card discloses, and which, in our npin- o
jon, places Henry Clay in his true character, of a C
heartless, selfish and ambitious politician. There e:
can bo no question that this ig his true character to i r
all intents and purposes, and that this is the estimate | p
put upon it, by all who know the man, and who have : tl
, no intorcst in concealing their real sentiments. Cul. j h
-* . Brent himself, deserves but little sympathy, nor will si
; he receive it from the community, for the mortifica- o
* ' tion und dofeat he has "uffbred, from placing confi. ir
dence in a man of whose hoartlessness arid treachery rr
he had in his possession, long previously, the evidence, a
Mr. Brent, in order to prove that all who overlrus. tl
ted Mr. Clay had been repaid by th* basest and 0
blackest ingratitude, quotes a letter which he had rc. o
. ccived from Gen. Harrison, as early as March, 1833. c
When it was supposed that Mr. Clay would be norn- "
inated for tho Presidency, Mr. Brent, in a letter ad- t
dressed to Gen. HarrisoNi urgcu mm iu csujjpuib me
nomination, should it be made; and in reply, under k
date of 1st March, 1833, the General says: ?I will a
y do my duty, even if Mr. Clay is to be benefitted by 1
it, from whom I have experienced only ungenerous P
treatment, in requital for years of devoted serviced s
We are not surprised at the development which w
. jjr, Brent's Card makes, of the character of Henry 0

iolism, is devoted, regardless of consequences, tc
lis own elevation, no matter who is sacrificed, ir
caching the goal at which he aspires. Mr. Clay, :l

WAR STEAMERS. Mr.
King'* Report in favor of a Ilomi
Squadron, alludes to the very great effort
vliicli have been made, and are making 1)}
England and France, especially the former
.0 create a fleet of war steamers wlncl
iiiall put competition at defiance. It can
lot be supposed that the British Govern
nent. in establishing lines of heavy steam
jrs 011 all the great maritime routes, is in
luenced solely by the direct advantage:
which will result from them to her com
lierce. On tlie contrary, her lending oh
ect doubtless is, with ostensibly pacifii
dews, to have ut command an irnmensi
lumber of steamers suitable for war ser
'ice, and capable at very short notice, 0
icing converted into war st< tincrs. Tint
vill give her most important advantages ir
:ase of a war with any naval power; tint
t certainly becomes those nations who I ?\
inv claim to this character, to consider by
vliat means, in the contingency suppsed,
hey are to tnect this new and dangerous
orce. With the economical views of the
I morirn n f4/)Vf*rnrnoi>l. if Mil llSirdll* IlP
x peeled thiii we shall undertake lo cornicle
with England in the particular f??rin
0 which we have alluded; but nevcrlheess,
we must have some contrivance by
1 hich we can dispose of whatever vessels
he ran send against us, or our seapirts
rill he at her mercy. We (In not hesitate
r? say that the plan proposed bv IMr.?
lediield, is at once the cheapest, the most
vailable and ellicient. which has been or
> likely to be suggested. It is briefly
his; to have always at hand a sufficient
timber of heavy Paixhau's or Cochran's
ontb cannon, to suppy all our passenper
Learners with one, two or more, acrnrdtg
to their capacity, strength, and power
fworking; and also to have a sufficient
orps of naval artillerists, drilled to this
special service, and rendered as perfect
t the science of gunnery as study and
ractice can make them. Engineers and
eck hands, of the proper character, could
e obtained without difficulty, it is prenmed,
in sufficient numbers, on the spur
f the occasion. Thus provided, we could
i ten days put afloat a fleet of artnet stealers,
which, in connexion with our forts
nd o'her means of defence, would render
ie situation of an invading fleet very on
omfortable. Mr. Redfield has shown that
ur passenger steamboats possess suflicinl
strength for the purpose; and in point
f alertness, they would be far superior
o the British or French steamers. They
vonld also be less exposed to destruction
iy Paixhnn shot than heavier vessels, in
smuch as the shot would pass directly
hrough them, instead of lodging and exloding
on board. There is no limit,
carcely, to the force which in this way
'0 could bring to bear upon an enemy on'
ur coast. With the preparations above

f indicated, it would be perfectly practicable.
, on very short notice,, to put afloat five
, hundred armed steamers. The 11(111)
. ber of artillerists required-, wbuld not be
i large; but they must be men of character,
. skill, and courage, and must be paid ac)
cordingly. A bill for the formation of a
i regiment of Marine Artillery, having the
i above object in view, would, in our judg:
ment, be far more important to the interr
esss of the country, than some of the meal
sures which are urged forward with so
, much zeal at the present Extra session.?
. We take it for granted that a suitable proi
portion of the S(>99.000 just appropriated
; for ordnance, will be applied the .purchase
i of Paixhan's guns, unless Cochran's or
Stephen's contrivance is better. At any
, rate, we must be prepared to defend ouri
selves in case of need;, and there are no
I engines of destruction so teirible that we
cannot use them as well as our enemies,
iJ Of course Mr. Redfieid's plan does not
supersede the construct on an I use uf a
| suitable number of heavy steamers, like
. those now building, uui mese alone, un*
less ih'eir number ivere milch larger than

i Shakerism.? Mr. Carter, a renounring
I shaker, visited this place a few weeks,
I since, and gave two or three lectures on |
shakerism, and sung some twenty songs, |
danced, exposed Miller's theory, and did !
several oilier things for the amusement of
. his audience. |
r | The Shakers' creed is a very curious
.'one. They believe in.one God, and two
t persons in the God-head?malp and female,
. or Father and Mother?called Power and
? Wisdom.
3j They believe that Adam was the Father
3 of the Old Creation and Eve was the Mo.;
tlicr?both being created after the intake
t of God; and that Christ is the Father of
f the New Creation, and Ann Lec the Mog
tlier?and that th? Millenium commenced
^ with the appearaote of Ann Lee on earth,
jjj They believe ii:the immortality of ani_
mals, as well as uf men. They say that
,/ John saw horses in lite world of spirits,
j as recorded in Rerelatinns. They believe
j that all the ugly and venomous animals
J on earth are symbolical of the evil spirits
! that inhabit the lower regions of the tnvisi
hit* world, and that all the beautiful rrea*
tures, st:elt as birds with gorgeous pluni'
age are symbolical of the good spirits in
R the mansions of bliss.
" They believe that the souls of. shakers,
? in their trances and vis-inns, really visit
11 the heavenly work). The lancet lias been
e applied to them, and their flesh has been
i scarified, while in this state, without
"j producing a particle of blood. One per3
son who visited the land of spirits in a
p trance, saw King David travelling, and

s Sorrows of Oi.d Bachelors.?We ncs
vor could, for the life of us, perceive why
r old maids should manifest such it mortal
, antipathy to old bachelors. There is no
t reason in their wrath. 'Tis spiteful, cruel
- and uncalled for; the trampling on a reed
- alreadj broken. It is .like flogging a crip
pie with his own crutches, because he is
lame. Few men are bachelors of their
s! own free will. Goto the veriest misan-!
thrope among them, and ask of liiin his
- historr, and be will tell you of the utiforz
gotten hours of his early affections; and
t his eye will light up again with its wonted
- energy, and as he relates the stcry of his
f love for one who had proved faithless, or
5 whose affections were repressed by the
i rude hand of arbitrary authority, who had
I gone down to the churchyard?a beauti'
ful bud plucked from the tree of Being, to
' open and expand in a brighter and holier
i sunshine, where no worm could guaw nti
< l her bosom, and no blighting descend upon
?'il. |
I Talk not to us of the sorrows of old i
maids! They are light as air in rompar-l
1 ison to those of bachelors?the patter of
| the small rain to the overwhelming of the,'
deluge. Old maids can commune together
'and mingle in the charities and kindly
j offices, and sympathies of existence. It
is not so with the bachelor. He has no
i home?be has no hannv fireside?rHi child
; in ask his blessing-?no beautiful creature
J ?>f smiles gentle tones to welcome his
J coming, and tnelt away the sternness of
j cure with the warm kiss of aftVclion?no
patient watcher at the couch of sickness,
stealing with a hushed and gentle s ep
around him, like the visitation of a spirit.
True?his sorrows are somewhat of a neguiive
character. Hut what is it save positive
agony, for him to gaze, all his life|
long upon the Paradise of Matrimony,
like a half starved school boy upon the
.garden whose enclosure he cannot scale?
