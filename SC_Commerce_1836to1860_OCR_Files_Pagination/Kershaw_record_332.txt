to b.v.ii parties, a circa:a a.mco tb it has n >'
occurred for a ntrnbrrnf years. Ms. Lewi

on any of the Committees; this was
done at his own request; owing to lire

In the Senate a bill for the removal of
the Snnkioie Indians west of the Mississippi,
r.s reported by the Committed on To

Donate on motion, went into Oomnrttes
on the Whole, on the' orders of the day,
(presentation of bills) and adjourned.
The House has done nothing. The fi,-st
part of the morning was spent, in debating
and voting by ayes and noes on Dr. 1 toucan's
right to the floor, in moving to admit
the New Jersey members?which qucst
on was first moved by Mr. Jenifer (whig)
of ManJand, and afterwards by Messrs.
J b iggs, Til linghast, and others. And when
tNc several speakers had finished, the
.Mouse decided that it was not in order for
the Doctor to proceed. The- Abolition
question was then again brought up by Mr
Coles, of Virginia, who asked for the suspension
of the rules for the purpose of introducing
a resolution on the subject. On
this being negatived, Mr. Chinn, of Lou.,

Northern one. On the vote being taken. 1
it was found that two-thirds were not in '
its favor, the motion consequently failed. '
Mr. Wise then attempted to gain the <
suspension of the rule but failed?and aft?r 1
considerable confusion, Mr. Sergeant, of /

GEN. HARRISON'S OPINIONS.
The Richmond IT7//.if inquires of us?
"what 4 unrecanted opinions, justly exceptionable
to the South' have been uttered
bv Gen. Harrison? vhen and where. V
j The Whig is mistaken in supposing that
we had been misled by others into imputation
of such opinions to Gen. Harrison
?we ha 1 i:i view the express words of
! Gen. 1!.; when we pe.noed our re mark?
and we proceed to answer the questions
of the IV///if, by the citation of our proof.
in the year 1633, in a Fourth of July
Oration, delivered at Cheviot, Ohio, Gen.
II.. after much sound d ictrine on the subject
of the constitutional inviolability of
slavery in the Stat ?, and censure of the
{ abolitionists, uttered the following unforj
tunatc declaration:
"Slvnld 1 be asked, if there be noway
j by which the General Government can
| :vd the cause ol emancipation? 1 answer,
hat it lias been long an object near m>j
heart to sec the whole of the surplus national
revenue appropriatnd to that object.
With the sanction of the Slates holding
-laves, there appears to me no constitutional
objection to its being thus applied, embracing
not only the colonization of those
hat any bo otherwise freed, bulthepurr/iavc
of the freedom of others. Hy a
zealous prosecution of a plan formed upon
ill's ba-i.s, tee mi aid look forward to a
dcy vet far dicta:;', ichcu the l\crlh
I American su/i would vol look down upon
\ ft. dare."
i\jre are "the unrecanted opinions,
justly exceptionable to the South,'' to which
v.e had reference. In these times of fanatic
and perilous interference with the
constitutional rights aud vital intcres s of
the Sout h, the South will be treacherous
to herself if she consents to the elevation
of auv one to the Presidency, who holds
emancipation " an object near his heart"

iad a meaning, too, when we sp oke 01
Jc:i. IPs " unrecorded opinions.*' We i
.vera not disposed to deny him a locus i
?but lie had his opportunity of
ocantation and evaded it. During the j
a t canvass for the PresM v.cy, wlienj
Mr. Van Baron, who as a S'naior in the
:Yc id York Legislature had fueortd the |
Missouri restriction, boldly and frankly!
icclarcd that, if elected to {lie Presidency,
ic would go into oflicc the inflexible and
inconinromising opponent of every atcinpl
to abolish slavery in the District of
L'oinrnb'a against tlie wishes of the slave
lolding states, and with a determination
;qt:uil) decided to resist the slightest inlerfcruice
with slavery in the several
-late -. Can. Harrison, who as a number
of Congress had ogj.cscd the Missouri!
nslricLivv. when qucsirmcd bv letters j
publicly addressed to him. .as they had |
jeento Air. Van JSuren; in relation to his!
" pinions on tiie subject, of slavery, prescr-|
red a suspicious and oniin >us .silence, and
lias abstained to this day from any public
avowal of his views. Thus Mr. Van Buren,
who had been a Missouri restrictions'
fearlessly made common cause with
die South, and boldly risked his election
n a sacred regard for her Constitutional
rights, and Gen. Harrison, who had aided
with the South on the Missouri question,
may justly be regarded as having
gone over to her enemies, or as at least
having given tkein "aid and comfort"?
and this conclvsion receives additional congrmation
from the fact that the nominee
of the Harrison party lor the Vice Presidency
wa: Francis Granger, a New York
Abolitionist, whom even the Harrison
V/higs of Virginia scorned to support.
The TT7..;g docs us but justice in assuming
our disposition to deal with perfect
fairness towards Gen. Harrison; and if
that distinguished citizen will even now
recant his f?r;ncr opinions, shake off the
Ab >!ifioitisis from his skirts, with the scorn
and loatlrng they deserve, and give a^
frank and fearless an assurance of his fidelity
to the constitutional rights of the
S ?t:th as .Mr. Van Buicn has done, we
shall not only be prompt but pleased to
proclaim it with trumpet tongue through(out
th: lan-l?howeucr opposed to Jiin for
the Presidency, we should rejoice, in such c
an event, to render him the amplest jus- y
tico, that his most ardent friends and ad- v
mirers could wish.
The "VVhi^ has our thanks for its courteous
maimer towards us; and would have v
! received an earlier response had its re- c
1 marks fallen earlier under our notice. "

SATURDAY MORNING, JANUARY 11, 1810. '
The Mails.?The irregularity of the i
mails, particularly from the North is ex- I
ceodinglv provoking; the more especial-, <
ly, when so much of it might be so casi-,;
ly remedied. A large number of ouri
. . I
Northern papers are constantly coming to<
hand, several days after they are due,'i
! via Charleston. This is the fault of some, i
of the Postmasters on the line between s
Raleigh and Washington, who instead of
sending the papers (ihose for Camden par-.
tirulnriy) by the Wilmington route, should
forward them by the Raleigh and Gaston
; line.
The Editor of the Smith Carolinian,
? i r . 1-* i
I win nave seen uciore mis paper rcm-nu
.him, that we have done Mr. Calhoun
jjusliro, by noticing as conspicuously, the
"fir contradiction" of the Whig rumours
i afioat, as wc did, that there were such
rumours. And wo feel assured thai, how
^ ever we may differ from Mr. Calhoun, as
; wc certainly do, on a great many points,
! neither the Carolinian, nor any other paI
per, takes more pleasure in giving currency
to this contradiction, than we do. We
j believe Mr, Calhoun to be right in the
[support he is giving to the prcseni Adj
ministration, and wc sincerely hope that
! he will cmlinue to sustain it. The measures
of Mr. Van Burf.n generally, are
I such as should command the approbation
of the South; certainly much more so,
than what may he exhibited from any other
i candidate likely to be brought in competition
with him.
i In relation to the Whig rumours however,
it may be proper to slate that wc
have not yet received the Richmond En
(juircr in exchange, and did not see
the "Hit contradiction" until after the
Journal was printed. With respect to the ,
change of position to which we referred. |
we cannot perceive that any injustice has
heen done Mr. Calhoun*, by the remark, '
as we think we are borne out by the facts I,
of the case. A controvcrsj' on this point
however, would be productive of no f
good, ar.d we do not therefore feel dis- ,
posed to urge the subject farther. <
Mr. Cali:o::.\".?In the Senate on the j
3d i 11st. this gentleman introduced "a hill k
to cede the Public Lands to the States in
which they arc respectively situated." In j
li; c course of his remarks on this hill, Mr. L
C. tAok occasion to declare, that " ail the ,
r , ... 1
Isading' measures of the present aoouius- :
lion had pmt his approbation, and should ..
receive his support." s
Gen. Harrison and Gov. Tyler have *
both accepted the nominations of the liar- J.
risburg Convention. The letters of acceptance
do not enter into any detail as ^
to the political principles t"f the nominees. '
For information on this subject, Gen. II.
refers to his letters to II. Den'NY, and the
Hon. Shkkrod Williams. He .hIso takes (
occasion to repeat the assurance that ifj (
elected, he will tinder no circumstances, ^
consent to be a candidate for a second c
l.
term.
The Temperance Cause.?It is stated in ''
the papers that a Dill has passed llie Sen- v
ate ofToxas by a unanimous rote, and no (I
doubt exists but what it will pass the House v
of Representatives, imposing a tax of one
thousand dollars upon every person enga-:
god in the sale of ardent spirits in quantities
less than a quart. The Legislature of
South Carolina might learn a most useful v
ti
lesson from this youthful Republic.

THE WEATHER. r
It is about two years since the discontin- f<
nance of this paper, and in all that time, the h
wot Id at large have remained in utter igno- j Ji
ranee ofthe important fact upon which we c
now intend to enlighten them?and we C
beg pardon foj not having notml it earlier; I3
we mean upon the subject of the Weather, h
We arc aware, that it has been sagely v
hinted, by srr.e 01 our i-uiumjiuiauco, .
that this subject, is only resorted to by t:
the fraternity, when all others fail, but for s
ourselves, we scorn the insinuation. The c
very reverse is the fuel, and we shall this s
week postpone much other matter, for the d
sake of informing our friends and the puh- t]
lie in general, and all whom it may con- h
crn, ill particular, lliat fur ilie last two j t
cars we have had the usual supplv of t
weather, and what is extraordinary, even j
ftcr the cessation ol' this paper, still the j
leather never failed. It is a remarkable j
ircumstancc however, that for several
ninths preceding our commencement,. i
hat the weather was so excessively dry,
hat in accordance with the old proverb,
'all signs failed!"?and we began almost
o despair of rain sufficient to raise the
iver; fortunate!/ however, about the renewal
of this publication, the rain fell in J
ibundance, and we have now a good
no liable river' Within the last ten days
we have had "all sorts" of weather; frost,
snow, wind, rain, ice, and sleet in abun
dance; and at this present writing, as line
delightful sun shine as the most fastidious
could desire. We do not of course, claim
uny instrumentality in producing this result,
but one tiling wc do know, and that
is. that this community needed a good
news paper as much as the river needed
rain, and that both conic about the same
time!!

Very little is lining in this body yet.?

The Committee made the following Rc- ;
port:?
Whereas, it has pleased the Almighty,
in the dispensations ol His providence, to
remove from us our late beloved and estermed
commander, Col. Joiin Ciiesnut,
Wr, the Kr-rshaw Volunteers, whose connexion
with him, not only as a friend and
neighbor, but'doring an arduous campaign '
in Florida,''under circumstances of peculiar '-5
hardship and trial, and in which he contracted
the disease which finally terminated .1
his existence, cannot on the occurrence of
so mournful an event, refrain from an cx- s
pression of our heartfelt sorrow for the 1
loss \vc have sustained; and our deep syn> '.'j
pa thy with his reaved family.
Our association with the deceased, more
particularly at the period above referred |
to, enabled ns to form a*correr.t estimate :!
of his truly amiable and virtuous character, - |
and we will ever cheri>b, in grateful re- y
mcmbrance, his firm, \ ct mild and gentle- ^
manly deportment towards Us as an olllcor.
In whatever light tlic character cf the >
def eated is viewed, it cannot fail to com- >
m :n 1 respect and admiration. A-afien',
he was anient and sincere; as a ciiizm, S3
public 'spirited, noble and generous; as a |
statesman, zealously de.vou d to the i terests
& prosperity ol our common country; i
as a patriot, the melancholy event which m
has hrouglit us together, f.lly attests !iis j
devotion. lie has fallen in the pi into ??f
his years, and the District and Stale have j
been d? priced of rhp sercici-s of one whose
early life promised a long career of use
tti'ness to Ins country, and hutior to himself.
Ho it therefore
Rrsolved, Thai i.t testimony of our ro
jret lor the loss which t he members of this \-'A
meeting, and the community in genet al,
have sustained in the death of Col. Joun '
Cues nit, wc will wear the usual badge of

death, our highly esteemed fellow-member,
Col. Joiin Ciiesnut; and although
the disease under which he laboured, was
of such a nature as lo deprive us for a I

Jischarged the duties devolving upon him
as a member of this body; and estimating
his truly noble and generous character, in
all the relations of life; sensibly leeling
