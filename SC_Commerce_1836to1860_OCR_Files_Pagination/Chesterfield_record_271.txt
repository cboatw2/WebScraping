BALEIGH AND GASTON BAIL ROAD.
We find in the Raleigh Register of last j
week, the third annual report of the com-j
pany for constructing this road, together;
with the report of the Chief Engineer. The j
road it is expected will be completed to |
Raleigh by or before the close of the present
year. The income, per month on the j
part of the road now completed, and in use, j
42 miles in length, is $3,183. The engi- j
neer estimates the profits of the road when j
completed to Raleigh, even if it should ex- j
tend no farther, at 6 per cent per annum
upon the capital invested. The following
is the part of his report which relates to the
extension of the road to Columbia.
If the Road should ever be extended to ;
Columbia, South Carolina, the stock would
certainly be one of the best in the? Union.?
There is scarcely n man who entertains a
doubt of this. The friends of the work know
it, and are anxiously endeavoring to find
some means of prosecuting this extension.
We see every day evidences of the opinions
of those whose local interests are opposed j
to this project. j
Id a Report recently made on an exam- / <
ination for an inland communication be ween 11
Wilmington and Charleston, by Mr. VV .ite,
Civil Engineer, he says : "Let us tor a moment
reflect what will be the consequences
of neglecting or delaying the execuiion of
this project. The line ot Rail Road wluc.i
is now completed to RaMgh, would be
pushed on to Columbia and Augusta, and
then our already languishing portion of the
State would be laid prostrate." This shows
Mr. White's opinion of the merits of the
Metropolitan line of travel. Tiie same Report
mentions a fact which would be a
strong argument in favor of the Raleigh and
Columbia Road, even if the inland communication
between Charleston and Wil.
mington were effected. He says t4iliat during
the sickly season, passen 401 s must be
^ North of Wilmington before sun-down."?
^ In short, it is almost too evident to nrgue.
that if Raleigh and Columbia were joined
by a Rail Road, the whole Southern and
South-western travel would be brought over
tl^Jialeigh and Gaston Rail Road.
jRt us, for a momen\ examine into the j
chances of this most desirable connection j
being formed. Surely each S ockholder I
in the Raleigh and Gas 01. Rail Roa J has j
the deepest possible interest in promoting
it Every Stockholder in any cf the Roads
between Rahigh and Baltimore has n deep
interest in this project. But no R 11 Road
Company, not even the Raleigh and Gaston,
has a deeper interest in promoting this
work than the Charleston, Louisville and
Cincinnati Rail Road Companies. There
are two Roads now constructing which
threaten to take the South-western travel
from them. One is the Macon and Savannah,
and the other is the Rru iswick City
and AppnlachicoJa Road. If either of these i
Roads is finished, it will take a larg^ portion i
of the travel irom the Charleston and Ham- 1
burg Road. The only thing which can se.;
cure them the travel will be the connection
of Columbia and Raleigh by Rail Read.
Nor has the Georgia Rail Road Company
less to fear than the Charleston and
Hamburg Road. The completion of the
Macon and Savannah Road would draw off
the greater part of this travel; and the
Brunswick and Florida Road would deprive i
them all of the travel from New Orleans. <
These views are so plain, that the
Charleston and Hamburg and the Georgia
Rail Road Company, cannot avoid seeing
their danger, and they will csrtuinly do any (
tiling in their power to obviate it.
If there is a Rail Road made from Columbia
to Raleigh, the Georgia Rail Road
from Decatur to Augusta, the South Carolina
Road from Augusta via Urunchville to
Columbia, the Raleigh and Columbia Road,
th8 Raleigh and Gaston Koad, a-c. would
form a line which would defy ail competition.
This route would be the shortest that
could be travelled. It would pass through a
perfectly healthy country, and it would
avoid the danger of Steam Boat navigation
at open sea.
The City of Charleston would be very
injuriously effected by the travel going
through Savannah or Brunswick, for it
would then pass Charleston in a Steam
Beat, without stopping, so that neither the <
City of Charleston, nor the Rail Road in
which that City is so deeply interested, could 1
be affected otherwise than injuriously, by i
the completion of this inland route from
Charleston to Wilmington, and these other
Roads in Georgia.
If (ho Raleigh and Columbia Road were
completed, the traveller from Charleston it- ,
self, instead of going out to sea, would go i
North through Columbia, and pay a tribute |
to the Charleston and Cincinnati Rail Road ?
Company. I
In reviewing the whole subject, we see ?
that such a vast amount of capital is <
dependent for its value on the completion j
of the Raleinh ond Columbia Road, that wp> f
cannot entertain a rational doubt of its beine ]
effected at no distant period.
This being the case, the Stock of the
Raleigh and Gaston Rail Road Company,
would be inferior to none in our country. ,
BAIL BOAD DEPOSITORY IN AUGUSTA.
The South Carolina Canal and Rail Road |
Company have presented a petition to the I
City Council of A ugusta for the privilege 1
of exiending the Rail Road, by a bridge I
across the Savannah River, and of estab- i
lishing a depot on the Augusta side, with <
such restrictions as the Council may deem :
necessary. The petition was referred to
the Committee of Nine, appointed by the i
Chairman of the late public meeting, held <
on the 22d inst., to report to tiie adjourned |
public meeting, to be held on the 29th inst. j
The object of the Company is not to es- i
tablished a toll bridge, but merely to extend 1
the road to Augusta, in order to avoid the i
inconvenience, and heivy tolls, attendant on <
passing good? over the Augusta bridge.? I
The town of Augusta owns ihe lands and j sn
wharves bordering on the Georgia cide of; 01
the river, and their free usp for the road and j v(
depository are asked by the Company.
FLORI DA.
We copy the following from the Tallahassee ^
Floridian of the 22d uit. 'h
The extract of a letter from Mr. Poinssett
to a citizen of this Territory, affords satiefac. 0
tory evidence that the Government htsresolv- R
ed that under no circumstances shall the Se- f,j
minoles be suffered to remain permanently in
Florida. The Washington Metropolis, a pa. tQ
per supposed to be in the confidence of the ,
Administration, edited by Judge T. J. Smith,
lately of this Territory, confirms this determi- a,
nation of the Executive, by information de- 0
rived from "undoubted authority." So far so ai
good. We learn Governor Call has not been ti
i fficially informed of the views of the Govern- s;
ment since Gen. Macomb's arrangement. I,
Sir?I take the liberty of requesting the pub fi
lication of the enclosed extract from a letter from u
the Secretary at War, which placs the arrange,
ment made by Macomb in its true light. It clear- Ir
ly shews that the Administration have no idea
of substituting the armistice made by Gen. n
Macomb for the Treaty of Payne's Landing. si
"We must expect hostilities to be partially Cl
continued for a short period after an armistice; '
but, I am of opinion that the arrangement made
by Gen. Macomb will lead to the pacification j h
Df the country and enable me to remove the In- Italians
from the Territory much sooner than can |jj
be done by force."

IMPORTANT DECISION TO TRAVELLERS. H
44
The Quincy (Mass.) Patriot gives notice S?
Df a novel decision in an action of Noah p,
Fifield, vs, the Braintree and Weymou h S
Turnpike Corporation, determined at the re
last term of the Court of Common Pleas
for the County of Norfolk, Mass. It was 8
settled that a person travelling over 6aid ra
Turnpike upon the common and ordinary pi
business of family concerns-?going to a w
scrist mill, etc.?is exempted from the pay. I11
ment of toll. These exceptions extend to in
procuring fuel for the fire und other necessaries
for the use of a family, and such oiher cc
business as necessarily appertains to the Jl'
support thereof. It was adjuged in this gr'
:ase that the plaintiff recover back the ;e(
amount of money paid the defendants for
toll while passing their toll gate for tho pur. th
poses aloresRid. ti
new gun. of
We were shewn, a few days since, a |?j
newly invented Gun, which, as far as we jy
were able to judge of the merits of such
death-dealing implements, is the most ingenious
and effective we have ever 6eeri or cr
heard of. It hus received the name of the
Torpedo, and was invented by Mr. B. F. fo
Smith, of South Hadley, Mass. and made w
in that town. It is so constructed that the w
cartridge, which contains the powder, brill,or
shot, and wadding in their proper order, is w
inserted in a chamber at once, and in a mo 80
mentoftime; and the discharge is produced
by percussion, the result of a rod or 1
piston driven forcibly throuuh a cap to the
powder in the chamber. With such facility
is the process carried on, that the piece can I(l
be charged and discharged ten timf-s in a rj,
minute, or once in six seconds. The machinery
connected with the gun is entirely m
bidden from sight. It is said to be perfectly g<
ife, and is considered a great improvement

i Mr. Clay in the morning; he very polite- ;
I invited us to call at his seat, a mile and
half out of town, which we did at four
'clock. He received us with all the ease j
nd urbanity for which he is so much dis- c
nguished, and entered freely into convcrnion

Rockingham
Female Institute.
HTIHE infcreased share of public attention
JL which the subject of Female Education has
ecently received, and the lively interest which is
cgioning to be felt in its behalf are encouraging
ligns of future improvement. The System wl licit
ias long obtained in our country, it is to be fejfiet*
ed, is radically defective in that almost exclusive
ittention is paid to the ornamental to' the neglect .
?f that which is of primary importance. This
desideratum, it has been the effort of Mrs. Greet,
the principal of the Rockingham Fentaie Institute
:o su pply ; and the result of the recent examination
which we had the pleasure of attending,'
proves that it was not without success# In th^s
Institution the culture of tne mind is the cardinal
Dbject of attention / and greater importance is
formation of habits of clbee
eiuowiicu iu %uv
thought and protracted mental effort by which
the mind is endued with strength, vigour and
jlasticity, than to any given amount of cuAu:;
information garnered up in the ''store house #f
memory."
The committee having attended the recent ex.
animation, take pleasure in expressing the satis,
faction they felt in witnessing the interesting
exercises. We feel no hesitancy in pronouncing
it equal, if not superior, to any examination of
the kind we ever before witnessed; and the^
readiness and accuracy with which answers were
given to the questions propounded, and the promptness
and facility with which aeetitms end
chapters of difficult fxUbooks were analized, did
honour to the pupils and reflected credit on their
worthy instructress.
On the Evening of the same day we weirs
highly entertained with the performanee| oflbe
young ladies on the Piano Forte and Guitar; and
though we are not professed connoisseurs, the
exhibitisn, we think, indicated that the perforin.
era correctly understood the true principles of
Musick. The exercises closed and we retired to
osr respective places of abode, after havrog
passed a highly interesting day.
The health and society of our village ronderit
a very desirable location for a female Institution y
and when we add to this, the competencyfof the
principal and assistant, the coramitt e take the
pleasure in recommending the Rockingham Pe.?-/
male Institute to the liberal patronage ofap in.
telligent public. . .??

PROSPECTUS
OF THE
NATIONAL MAOAZINS
AN 0
Republican Review; Jqiin
L. Smith, Publisher and Proprietor. ?
Throughout the civilized world the miuda 61
men are, to an unusual degree, employed in
what comes home to the business and bosoms of ?c
alt, the mode in which their Governments are
administered, the principles upon which they
act, and the measures which they pursue. Theso
are the topics of newspaper discussion, and of
debate In our various legislative assemblies. It
is, however, somewhat remarkable thai in this
country so few efforts have been made to sustain
any periodical publication upon this principle,
while in Europe, and particularly in CScaat Brit,
ain, politics form the staple or many of tbsir
moat valuab'e works of this description.
The peculiar position of our country renders
i.? xmunt nn nnsoicious moment fof undertA.
king a peri >dical of this character- The coadttt
is arrayed into two great divisions, one of which
may be denominated the Administration, the oth?
et the Opposition party. The conduct of the
former is encountered by', it is believed, a larger
proportion of numbers, a greater portion of
intelligence, and a higher grade of prineipln^The
Motives which guide the Administration
party we conceive to be narrow and erroneous
?the doctrines they promulgate dangerous and!
pernicious?the objects they have in view, andf
the tendencies of their measures selfish and do.
struetive. It is time that they be met with vigor
and with systom.
The gradual but obvious aggrandisement ofthe ''
(idwerofthe Executive, at the expense ofthe
egislatire and judicial branches of the General
I Government, shbujd be exhibited to the public
| mind. The plausible pretenses under which
this design is furthered should be exposed. The
systematic plans by which corruption is spreading
itself troughout the land, the discipline
which has been introduced into the party ranks,
the undisguised and open interference of the
officers of the Federal Government in the eleu.
tions even of local officers, the regular levying
of contributions for the purpose of carrying on
the party warfare, the devotional loyalty to the
heads of a faction which is now exacted, and the'
proscription of those who refuse to yield it, are "
all subjects which demand and ought to receive
a more full and prepared exhibition than they
have yet received. These topics will form, in
connexion with general views of the foreign and
domestic policy of the Government, a principal
subject of oar attention.
Though politics will constitute tlte principle
fiortion of this Magazine, the interests of general
iteraturO will not be disregarded. Essays on
Philosophical and Moral subjects; Reviews and
Critical Notices; Historical and Biographical
Sketches, and especially essays connected with
the vital subj -ct of Popular Education, will .be
occasionally inserted. . t
The publisher win cmorace suiutuiu lenities
of improving or extending the plsn, which
may be presented by increased patronage.
Engravings of Distinguished PublfC' Men will
embellish the Magazine, as circumstances may
allow the additional expense to be incurred.
