Whilst die n ocssities existing during the
present year, for the s Tviec of militia an<
volune-rs, have furnished new proofs o
the patriotism of our fcllo.v citizens, the)
nave also strongly illustrated the impcr
t mee of an increase in the rank and file o
te regular army. The views of this sub
jec% submifed by the Secretary of War ir
h s report, meet my entire concurrence, ant
are earnestly commended to the deliberate
atten i?>n ofCongress. I:i this connexion i
is also proper to remind you, that the defect:
in our f?r- sent militia system are every da)
rendered more apparc it. The dn'v of making
further provision bv law, for organizing,
arming, and disciplining this arm oi
defence, has bren so repeatedly presented
to Congress by myself and my predecessors,
that 1 decrn it sullicicn*, on tilts occasion,
to refer 'otlie last annual message, and
to former Executive communications in
which the subject has been discussed.
Ir appears, from the reports of the officer*
charged with mustering into service the voluureers
called for under the act ofCongrcs?
of t!ie last session, that more presented
thomselves at the place of rendezvous in
Tennessee than were sufficient to meet the
reo'jiskio.i which had been made by the Secr-tarv
of War upon the (Jovcrnor of thai
State. This was occasioned by tiie omiss
on of the Governor to apportion the requisitinn
to :1m different regiments of militia,
so as '0 obtain the proper number ol
Troops, and no inorc. it seems hut jest to
rite patrio ic citizens who repaired So the
general rendezvous, under circumsianccs
authorizing them :o believe that their services
were needed, and would be accepted,
taut the expenses incurred by tlicm, w.hile
;\hs?-p^ from n?yjr imipor r'u.nl.l !*.? oi.i.l -Uh
inc UUYtTlllir III* l
mend iha: a law to this effect be passed by
Congress, giving them a compensation
tvhich will cover their expenses on the
march to and from the place of rendezvous,
and while there, in connexion with
which, i; will also be j/oper to make provision
lor such o.her equitable claims, growing
out of the service of the militia, as may
not be embraced in the existing laws.
On the unexpected breaking ou. of hostilities
in Florida, Alabama, and Georgia,
ir became necessary, in some cases, to take
the property of individuals for public use.
Provision should be made, by law, for indemnifying
toe owners; and I would also
r< spec luliyaugges*, whether some provision
may not be made, consistently with the
principles of our government, for the relief
of the surFer rs by Indian depredations, or
by the operations of our own troops.
N i time was lost, after the making of
the requisite appropriations, in resuming
the great national work of completing the
unfinished for.ifications on our seaboard,
and of placing them in a proper state of
defence In consequence, however, of the
very lute day at which those bills were passed,
but little progress coald be made during
the season which has just closed. A very
large amount of the mo.iovs granted tit
your last session accordingly remains unexpended;
but as the work \vi? be .again resumed
at the earliest moment in the coming
spring, the balance of the existing uppropria
ions, and in several cases which will be
1 tid before you, with the proper estimates,
fur her sums for the like objects may be
usefully expended during the next year.
The recommendations of an increase in
the Engineer Corps, and for a re-organization
of the Topographical Corps, submitted
_ i . i
i,> vou in my last annual message, derive
additional strength from the great embarrassment
experienced during the present year
in those branches of the service, an i under
which they arc now suffering. Several of
the most important surveys and constructions,
directed hv recent laws, have been
suspended, in consequence of the want of
adequate lbrce in these corps.
Tnelike observations may be applied to
the Ordnance Corps and the General Start,
the opera ions of which, as they arc now
organized, must either be frequently intcrrupted,
or performed by officers taken from
the lino of the army, to the great prejudice
of the servic.
For a g'-neral view of the condition of die
r.Iiiitary Academy, and of other brandies
of the military service not already noticed,
as well as for fuller illustrations of those
which have been mentioned, I refer vou to
the accompanying documents; and among
the various proposals contained therein, for
legislative action, I would particularly notice
the suggestion of the Sucietary of War, for
tiie revision of the pay ol the army, as entitled
to your favorable regard.

with the elevated character of the objects J

I beg leave to renew the recommendation

the enlistment of boys in our naval service, i
and to urge upon }'our attention the neces- !
si y of fiirlher appropriations to increase !

I The report of the Postmaster General };
presents a gratifying pic.urc of the condition <
i of the Post Office Department. Its rove- i (
i p.u"s for the vear ending the 3(>:!i of June ; <
* i
ilas', were 33,398,453 19, showing an in- ]
' crease of revenue, over that of the prcced- j i
! ing year, of 8404,873 53, or more than j;
j thirteen per cent. The expenditures for the I i
same year were 82,755,623 76, exhibiting i
; a surplus of 8642 831 43. The depart- ;
: mer.t has been redeemed from embarrass- 1
i moot and debt; lias accumulated a surplus t
! exceeding half a million of dollars ; has r
largely extended, and is preparing still far- s
| tlier to extend the mail service; and recommends
a reduction of postages equal to (
| about twenty per cen-. It is practising up- 11
j on the great principle which should control t
> ' -c? /i ..... I
every imiucu ui our wtciuiuvui) ui iw | \
dering o tl?o public the greatest good pos- [
siblo, with the least possible taxation to the j x
i people. 11
The scale of postages, suggested by the h
1 Postmaster General, recommends itself not jj
j onlv by the reduction it proposes, but by I \
J the simplicity of its arrangement, its con. J c
I fortuity wi;h the Federal currency, and the
improvement it will introduce into the ae- j (j
; conn's of the department and its agents. " j s
Your particular attention is invited to the f
subject of mail contracts with rail-road com- c
panics. The present laws providing for the y
making of contracts are based upon the > c
! presumption that competition among bid- j I
dors will secure the service at a fair price. 1 h
But on most of the rail-road lines, there is i tl
no compc i ion in that kind of transporia- ! J
rion, and advertising is therefore useless. ! s
; Xo contract can now be made with them, j c
i except such as shall be negotiated before j j|
j the time of offering or af.crwards, and the u
; power of the Postmaster General to pay | h
them high prices is, practically, without limi-1 :c
tation. It would be a relief to him, and 110 ! a
doubt would conduce to the public interest,1 e
to prescribe by law some equitable basis j c
upon winch such contracts shall rest, and : o
res'rict him by a fixed ru!e ol allowance. ; o
Under a liberal act of that sort, lie would j c
undoubtedly be able to secure the services ,],
of mo>t of the rail-road companies, and the ai
: interest of t!ie department would bo thus rc
advanced. ! ai
The correspondence between the poo- 1 ir
pie of the United Slates and the European ! v:
nations, and particularly with the British Is!- <|
nnds, lias become very extensive, and re- j ft
quires the interposition of Congress to give 1 b
it security. No obstacle is perceived to
an interchange of mails between New York ;
and Liverpool, or other foreign ports, as j
proposed by the Postmaster General. On ;
the contrary, it promises, by the securi y it |
will afford, 10 facilitate commercial transactions,
and give rise to tm enlarged inter- i ,'e
course among the people of diliercnt na- j tli
ttons, wliich cannot but have a happy effect. I st
Through the city of New York, inost oft ft
the correspondence between the Canadas j 2'
and Europe is now carried on. and urgent; a

nich it is now subjected. Some logisla- j
un appears to be called for, as well by ' {
ur own interest, as by comity to the ad- j j
dnint; British Provinces. I .
The expediency of providing a fire-proof j ;
uilding for the important books and papers j i
f the Post Ofiice Department is worthy of ; i
onsidcration. In the present condition of;
ur Treasury, it is neither necessary nor 1
rise to leave essential public interests ex- j
oscd to so much danger, when tlicy can !
o readily be made secure. There are j
,'eighty considerations in the location of a I
io\v building lor that department, in favor i
f placing it near the ether Executive build- !
ngs.
The important subjects of a survey of the
.oast, and tlie manufacture of a s'andard
>f weights and measures for the diilerenr j
mstom houses, have been in progress for
iomo years, under the general direction of J
he Executive, ami the immediate snpenn- |
ender.ee of a gentleman possessing high j
scientific attainments. At the last session of J
Congress, the making of a set of weights ]
mil measures for each State in the Union
,vas added to tiie others by a joint resolu- j
ion.
The care and correspondence, as to ali
these subjects, have been devolved on the ;
Treasury Department during the last year. ,
A special report from the Secretary of the ;
Treasury will soon be communicated to j
Congress, which will show what has been j
accomplished as to the whole?the number
and compensation of the persons now em- |
ployed in these duties, and the progress ex- 1
pected 10 be made during the ensuing year;
with a copy of the various correspondence 1
deemed necessary to throw light on the j
subjects which s?-em to require additional j
legislation. Claims have tx en made for >
retrospective allowances in behalf of the i
superintendent and some of his assistants,!
wiiicli 1 did not feci justified in granting; I
other claims have been made for large in- |
crease in compensation, which, under all ,
the circumstances of the several cases, I !
declined making without the express sane- :
- r _.i...,i.?#
lion 01 is on gross, in oruer iu uuumi uiai
sanction, the subject was, at the lntt scs- :
sion, on my suggestion, anil bv request of
the immediate superintendent, submitted >y j
the Treasury Department to the Committee !
of Commerce of the House of Represent*- :
tives. Rut no legislative action having taken
place, the early attention of Congress !
is now invited to the enactment of some ex- i
press and detailed provisions in relation o i
the various claims made for the past, aid
to the compensation and allowances deer*,
i'd proper for the fuure.
It is further respectfully recommendei, j
that, such being the inconvenience ol at:em j
lion to these duties by the Chief Magis rate, j
md such tin? great pressure of business on
:hc Treasury Department, the general su-1
v~>>-v!v;7?m r\i' ftir? pmnsf siirvpv. nnd the Colli- f
pletion of the weights and measures, if thoj
works arc kept united, should be devolved I
D!i a board of officers, organized specially
ki- pu.-|trrr, or oil itre Navy Bourd at- /
ached to the Navy Department.
All my experience arid reflection confirm
lie conviction I have so often expressed to I
Jongress in favor of an amendment of the !
institution which will prevent, in any i
went, the election of the President and Vice ;
'resident of the United States devolving on !
he House of Representatives and the Sen- i
itc ; and I therefore beg leave again to so- 1
icit your attention to the subject. There \
verc various other suggestions in my last!
innual message no. acted upon, particular- !
y that relating to the want of uniformity in
he laws of the D:s rict of-Columbia, that
ire deemed worthy of your favorable con- !
idcration.
Before concluding this paper, I think it '
luc to the various executive departments to j
tear tes imony to their prosperous condi- ;
ion, and to the ability and integrity with 1
vhich they have been conduced. It has ,
ecu my aim to enforce in all of them a

Having now finished the observations

annot omit an expression of the gratitude j
'hich is due to the great body of my fellow- ;

I'his adjutant of Death lately brought a suit in ii
i Massachusetts court against one Winches- p
er, who, says the N. Y. Courier and Enqui- t
rr, " had undertaken to commit the crime of t.
Manslaughter, by retailing nostrums under the
rhomson brand." He laid his damages at o
j!10>fvn0 " Such a sum," says the same pa- tJ
ier, "is too small for using the genuine article, j h
md for one who would counterfeit it. it is . a
'bnnn.uitly too low. :r privnt onii:ie;i is t*
lint he ought to be hanged." The Judge
barged the jury that before Thomson could
ecovcr, lie must shew, first, that the defendmt's
medicine was worse than his own ; and,
secondly, that the counterfeit had brought the
genuine into disrepute. "The first point,"
ulds the Courier and Enquirer, "involves an
mpossibilitv, as we take it, inasmuch as no
piackery can be worse than Thomson's ; and
!he second?though good law is bad equity?
since any body who could succeed in bringing
such charletanry into disrepute ought to lie
"herished as a benefactor,^ instead of being
mulcted in damages. As to the "special
damages" sustained by the arch quack himself,
they ought in all conscience to be set oil
nn'iKrumist thn rljimanres doilC

to the silly people who have submitted to his
prescriptions." The jury seemed to be of the
same opinion; their verdict was for the defendant.
