and in the latter city have established a
provisional government. A number of
remetable Haytien merchants, and other
indtviduals have been imprisoned. Dr.
Lovell, a American citizen,mneb respec

ers, is condemned to death. No witnes
se having been called to corroborate the
charges alleged against him, the United
States Commercial Agent has been in
duced to report accordingly to your See
retary of State, regoesting assistance and
protection.

revolt is entirely at a stand, and until po
litical afairs are settled one way or the
other, no collections will be made, and no
produce. we fear, will come to market.
