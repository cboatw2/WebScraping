RETURN OF THE EXPLORING EXPE
DITION.
The United States ship Vincennes, reachc
vg., this port last evening. The following account c
-s5F the labors of the Expedition, has been furnishei
to the-public prints by some of the officers en
gaged in it
The Exploring Sq^ron sailed from the Uni
ted States on the 18th of August 1833, and ha:
been abscr.t nearly four years; during which tim<
we learn '.hat the different vessbla'have sailed a
bout four hundred thousand miles. The Expe
i *. dition has thoroughly executed every part of tin
duties confined to it by the government
The "positions* assigned on the charts to seve
ral vigias, reefs shoals, and islands, have beei
caefully looked for, run over, and found to haw
no existence in or near the places assigned them
Several of the principal groups and islands ii
tueTPacific Ocean have been visited, examine:
afia surveyed; a friendly intercourse, and protec
live commercial regulations, established with lh<
chiefs and natives; aggressions on our citizen
and commerce redressed, and a justly ineritei
punishment meted out in some flagrant cases o
unprovoked and cold blooded murder.
The discoveries in the Antarctic Ocean, (An
tarctic continent?observations for fixing th
Southern Magnetic pole, &c.) preceded those c
the French and English expeditions. ? ""
The report which has been in circulation, c
Captain Ross having run over some portion o
the land discovered by this Expedition, is un
founded. No land to the eastward of 1009 o
east longitude, was discovered, seen or claimed
by the Expedition, as appears by Captain Wilkc:
report to the Navy Department, published ii
1840, after the return of the Squadron to Nev
Zealand. IT the statement originated with Cap
tain Ross, based upon the particular chart of thi
Antarctic ice, and discoveries of land, with th<
full explanatory letter which was furniseed hin
by Captain VViJkes {previous to Captain Ross':
antarctic cruize,) he (Captain Ross) must liav<
taken that portion of land reported to have beer
seen by Bellamy in 1809, which was represent
ed on it, as being in 163 or 1G5 degrees eas
longitude, or thereabouts, and which the Ameri
can Expedition had never seen or heard of unti
its return to Sidney, N. S. \V., after their dis
coveries in the Antarctic Ocean.
Captain Ross, according to his report, ha<
never passed over, or gone so far west, as 1G(
degrees east, in latitude 67 degrees south; con
> sequently he could r.ot have seen the land dis
^covered and claimed by the American Expedi
5,1 tion, but seems to'have run over the positioi
where land isTcported to have been seen by hi;
-own countryman-Uellamy.
The Expedition, during its absence, have als(
examined and surveyed a large, portion of the
Orfegdn TyiTuoYy, a'parfoi" Upper California, in
eluding the Columbia and Sacramento Rivers
with their various tributaries. Several explor.
ing parties from the Squadron have explored, examined,
and fixed those portions of the Oregon
Territory least known. A map of the Territory
embracing its Rivers Sounds, Harbors, Coasts
.Forts, &c. has been prepared, which will furnisl
the government with a mass of va'uab'e infornn
lion relative to its possessions on the Northwes
Coast, and the whole of Oregon.
Experiments were made with the pendulum
on. "Alouna Loa" on the Island of Hawaii, on
of the Sandwich Islands, at a height of fonrteei
.sand feet above the level of the sea. Topogra
pbical surveys and views were made of some o
its active and most extensive craters.
Experiments have been made with the pen
flulum magnetic appcritus, and various other in
-strumcnts, .on all occasions?the temperatur
of the ocean, at various deaths, ascertained i
the different 6eas traversed, and full meterolc
.gical and other observations kept up during th
cruiseCharts
of all the surveys have been made
with view and sketches of headlands, towns o
villages, &c., with descriptions of all that aji
pertains tothe localities, productions, language
customs and manners.
At some of the Islands, this duty has bee;
attended with much labor, exposure and ris!
. -vof life; the treacherous cBaraotcr of the native
rendering it absolutely necessary that the off
cers and men should be armed while on dutj
and at all times prepared against their murder
ous attacks. On several occasions, boats ha?
teen absent from the different vessels of th<
squadron, on surveying duty, (the greater por
tio? of which has been performed in boats,
. Among islands, reefs, &c. for a period of ter
twenty, and thirty days at one time; on one c
these occasions, two of the officers were kille*
at the Fiji group, while defending their boat'
crew from an attack by the natives.

Sftveral islands not laid down in the chart
have been discovered, on one of which the *na
tives offered worship, evidently believing tha
their visitors had come from the sun.

The tender Flying Fish, which had aoconr
panied the squadron during the whole cruise, ur

hard service, that it was deemed imprudent 1
hazard the lives of men and officers in her, ft

JHigh Handeb Outrage. Another Insult.? s
- We conceive it to be our duty to take up with s
i earnestness every act of injustice done to Ameri- ti
e cans, and we therefore give to the public the fol- u
i. lowing information relative to as gross a viola- a
i tion of property as ever look place under any go- c
d vernmept $ 1
While the Grenadian schooner Henrietta was v
e on her waj^rotn Providence to Kingston last n
s October, loaded mostly with American property, n
d! she was seized by the Carthagena squadron ui;- n
f dcr Commodore Rafael Tono, off Carthagena.? n
The cause assigned for this detention was, that e
- the port whence she was despatched had thrown s
e offiher allegiance to the Government, although o
'f the vessel was only a poor merchant schooner,
! carrying on her usual trade between the coast ?
if and Jamaica. This was a mere means of mak
nig u jinte, luu pruceeub ui which were ui coursu <
- to be distributed to the capturing squadron. I
f When tlie Henrietta arrived, the squadron was I
I* afraid to leave her under the protection of the /
s walls of the blockaded city during the night, so /
a J they ordered her away, placing an officer and 30 I
v men on board. A gale dispersed the squadron (
- on the next day, and the Henrietta parted com- (
2 pany; and being boarded by a boat from Savanil- (
la, was carried there, and the cargo disposed of J
by the government. In the meantime, the Judge ]
at Carthagena declared that the Henrietta was }
not a good prize and therefore the government ji
that detained hear is now responsible for the loss {
of the cargo. ?
The affair is as simple as possible, neverthe- ^
i less the proper indemnification has not yet been y
made, although the Consul made the necessary }
requisition since the 14th October; not even an
answer has yet been obtained. Had the affair /
been a British one, perhaps some better attention }
would have been displayed, but poor Americans (
j must submit in that country to be treated upon a
! very different footing.
Ought this to be? Ought not something to be
done immediately in this case? We trust steps
will be taken to teach the Carthagenians that
America is not be insulted with impunity.

Another Slave Case.?Week before la6t a |,
?; Mr. Watson, of Virginia, claimed a female slave g
who had run away from him several years ago, C
1 gone to Philadelphia, where she married and had s
1 since been living.?Upon the application of Mr.
' W atson a writ was granted for her arrest and
| imprisonment, preparatory to hearing his claim.
1: Before 6he was arrested, however, Watson got
! an opportunity to seize her himself; he availed !j
himself of it, placed her in a carriage, conveyed
i her to Wilmington. Del., thence tool; the cars 1
>' and brought her home. This abduction created 8
c: a stir among the Abolitionists?the driver of the
11' hack which took Watson and the servant from
-! the Hotel, was arrested and held to bail in the
'f; sum of $300, to answer the charge of assault J
I and battery upon the woman; based upon his as- I

ing the public credit exhausted and his compa- E
triots discouraged, rose and said.? a
ir "J have three thousand dollars in hard money;
' I will pledge my plate for three thousand more;
' I have seventy hogsheads of Tobago rum, which .
shall be sold for the most it will bring. These
11 arc at the service of the State. If we succeed
k in defending our firesides and homes, I may be
R remunerated; if we do not, the property wiil be
of no value to me. Our old friend Stark, who 1
'? so nobl}* maintained the honor of our State at *
Bunker Hill, may safely be entrusted with the 1
B; conduct of the enterprise; and we will check 6
c the progress of Burgoyne." I*

y | met with some advocates even in our own coun:o

)r by which the evils of the slave trade were to be
x- remedied. England is herself carying on, at this

The wife of Austin not long 6ince died,

bereaved state. Hard by lived a neighbo^ i

ne day mourned with his neighbor over his own'
ard lot, while he congratulated him upon the posession
of such an excellent wife. The neighbor
eemed to think that he would prefer the daugh-.

as she was. A swaprtM finally proposed &

of the difference in the ages of the females.

nonths lived with the wife of liis neighbor, who
fiakes good the place of her whose loss he had
Jiourned. The daughter of Austin furnishes the
icighborwith a wife, with which he is'vvell pleasd,
congratulating himself not a little that he has
mapped off his old wife for a "brann new one, and
