We can, shall we sav we will form such a tor.

As soon as the National Agricultural Society
is formed, let us ask Congress to appropriate
the "Smithsonian fund" of half a inil ion of
dollars to establish a National School. If I
we unite as we should do, our "torrent" will
be too strong for time serving politicians to
resist.
I look'upon he National Agricultural
School as the greatest blessing to flow
from the National Society.
But the Journal of the Society will also
prove of immense advantage: It will

.... . ..ii
1 here has neen an argument raisea against
organizing such a society at pre- \
sent, " because the public mind has not
been sufficiently instructed, and docs not
sufficiently appreciate the advantages of
such an association to render it successful."
How it is on this very account that the j
friends of the proposed National Society;
w*sh to see it established, that the operations
thereof may wake up an excitement
throughout our " wide scattered population,"
that shall be the moving cause of
changing the " condition of the country."
It is also argued that the failure of t
several state and county societies is prcof
that a national one must fail also.
Let me ask if this is a valid argument?
This short quotation, in my mind, is I
sufficient to throw the whole force of
the argument into nonetity : " Divided j
and scattered as w<? a'p, we spend our j
forces as it were,drop by drop, whereas
union would make us mightier than a tor- i
rent."
The object of all state and county societies
has been of a local nature. Their
existence has been known only in their
own locality, and they have been too
weak in numbers tc command legislative
aid. Who cr,n tell what would have
been the effects if all he members of the
local societies in the Union had been
attached to one National Society? If
*M the exertions, of all these societies,
.. . . . i "j ii_. i i i
collectively and maiviauaiiy, uuu neen
concentrated upon our ooject, woukf it
not have formed a " torrent as mighty,
comparatively speaking, as the thundering.
N ;m; ira. If the nation, instead of
Individual*, ! H received all the light of
the intelligent minds thai have been devoted
to these local societies, would it
now be said " that! he public mind was
not sufficiently enlightened to appreciate
the advantages to be derived from a Na-1
tional Society ?" Kail the money that
has been devoted 44 drop bv drop" upon j
44 model farms" and local sc hools had t
been concentrated, should we not have on ,
institution worthy the great country wy
inhabit ?
If our population is scattered ; if44 long
distance intervene between the most effi.
cient friends of agricultural improvement,"
s<-> much the more need of forming such a
society as shall draw tiiam together in
44 one strong bond of brotherhood." ;
Is it a fact,4 that the time has not yet!
arrived when such an "issociation can be
ArMi.ired with a reasonable eortaintv of
success ?" If such is (he fact, I am His.
appointed in the character and energy of
my countryman.
Once more I c ^llupon you to answer'
me this question am I so disappointed J
in vour character ?
Do not refuse your countenance to the |
measure because it does not originate in
high places. For * if we ire ever to have
a National Society of Agriculture, it must

and as one of that class I now address
you.

PRESE.NT ATI ON OF THE TiPPE- j
CANOE FLAG.
To the President of the United Slates*
New York, May 1, 1841..
In May last, on the Tippecanoe battleground,
in presence of somclhirty thousand
people, I .was intrusted by the sum*,
ving soldiers of that memorable field with I
ihefiag that was in the midst and thicknfthp
strife, which f was commanded '
to take to this commercial metropolis, to
be displayed here, before o?ir fellow-cifizens,
as a living, speaking emblem of the
valor of their old commander, and of the
perils he had undergone. When the political
contest was*over, (in which his
courage had been questioned) and the j
People had seated him as President in the
White House at Washington, I was also
to bear it there, and, in the name of his
fcllow-soldiprs, request him to deposit it among
the honored trophies of the Republic.
I promised on that ground to execute
this commission, and with an earnest
conviction of coming success?ihat
the forty-two pounder of the Empire State
should herald its arrival there; but in the
midst of scenes jo eventful as those of
March, I put off* the duty in the hope of a
more quiet day, when, now, alas! there is
the quiet of the grave ! .
I see, therefore, no way so proper to
obey the orders of the brave men of Tippecanoe
as to lay this flag before you, the
successor, for whom were the (lying in
junctions of their illustrious Chief, and j
upon whom his office, and I trust, his spirit;
has fallen, with the roquet; that you wil!1
carry out the wish of his corppr.'rjrN >r.!
arms by depositing it among the 'rcphie
the Republic. I heg you, in th<ur on k\ j
most tenderly co cherish ir. Ot.j*,r ' rgs!
of our countrymen, have no doubt, b?. ..n
as gallantly defended, and were as g'oiiouson
land or sea; while they may have
won but a single ship, or a single field,
this has the honor of winning whole j
States, of conquering empires, ind ed.?
An old Eagle !il:e thir., borne by the pioneersofthe
wilderness, that has added to
the reign of liberty and law, become a holy
emblem, with its in hocsigno pinc.es upon
if. crying out as from the spirit of the
p. st to the future, and which as the coun.
try becomes oldc ai.d greater becomes
to all posterity holier and dearer.
I have th? honor to be yours, resncctfullv,
JAMES BROOKS."
THE PRESIDENT'S REI LY.
To James Ttrool s, Ksq.
Washington, May 4, 1341.
''The flag which was in the midst and
thickest of the strife," and was committed
to your care on the Tipp?;c?u.;>e hattie-ground
by the surviving soldiers of t hat
memorable field, and which they commanded
you to hear to tins metropolis as
an emblem of the valor of their old commander
and of the perils he had undergone,
has - been delivered into my hands,
and will be placed by me among the
honored trophies of the Republic. The
account which was given me some
years ago, by the gallant English, now
no more, who upheld that banner amid
the perils of the fight, had prepared me
to expect to see it as it is, gashed by the
nnmK'Ui'!; ami rpnf hv halls. That En-1!

twenty men of the gallant company over <
which, when the sun went down, that flag I
so proudly waved, survived to tell in the <
morning the hazards of that terrible night, i
From that brave soldier, who afterwards <
held a high place in the hearts of the i
people of Indiana, I learned properly to i
appreciate the feat less bearing and con- i
duct of the patriotic citizen who has so i
recently exchanged this earthly taber- <
nacle of clay for one that endureth for j i
ever. Death is the common heritage of 11
- - * -4 ,1.4 ,
all mankind; so to Jive oui as mai me ?
darkness of the grave shall not obscure I
our names, and that they be placed in <
close association with the names of the i
great and good who have gone before and i
who are to come after us makes death i
, " j
itsplf a consummation rather to be wished I
thnr. feed, and throws a light of glorv i
over the grave. Such now, is the oondi- <
lion of 4,the old commander" ir?to whose !
hand*, when yuu received this Hag, you i
1
so joyously anticipated its delivery. His
deeds are now''enrolled in the Capital,"
and this banner shall hie preserved as a
memorial oi a battle welj fought, and of a
victory most nebly won. ^ i
I pray you, sir, to accept assurances of <
"nrjv great respect. JOHi\ TYLER.
The bearer of the flag at the battle of
Tippecanoe, alluded to in the above reply
of the President, some of our readers may
not recollect, was Ensign Tipton, a Tennesseean
by birth, who started from home
with only his axe for a patrimony, and
who subsequently became a Senator in (1
the Congress of the United States, and j
one of the first men in Indiana. Of him | 1
ihe anecdote is rarrated, we have seen in ,
the public journals, whers Geu. Harrison | <
is represented as riding up in the heart'
of the battle, inquiring of the young Tip- 1
ton, " Where is your Captain ?" 44 Dead '
sir." 44 Your Lieutenant V* 'Dead ! sir." |
"Your second Lieutenant?" "Dead I sir." 1
"Your Ensign?" "He sta nds before you!" 1
where Tipton then stood, holding and de- '
fending this very flag, but so covered witii j
dirt anu so besmeared witjb, blood that I
Gen. Harrison scarcely Tipew him. <
' Hold on." said Harrison "for a moment i
I
| longer;" "I will reinforce voy;" and he i
! rode off and led up there the ^ompany of

red brethren in the prairies, the Cumanch- k

I can speak their languages very well, h
and if I can get to them before 1 am ta* u

From the Charleston Courier,

The incessant devotion of Professor hi
Anthon to the cause of classical literature ai
has he en already evinced by his publication
of a series (not completed) of the an- tl
oient Greek and, Romar classic auth-^-s; is
his ability and fideltv, in the cxe~u ?^n w
of the arduous task, have be^n tested by z
the almost universal use of his editions tl
of the classics in the seminaries of our 2
own country, and their general adoption d;
in the most eminent schools of Great Bri- tl
tain and Ireland, as we lasbythe warm p<
sulogies bestowed upon his labors by some s<
of the most distinguished philologists tr
in both hemispheres. Independent of tr
such incontestible proofs of superior schol- tl"

fcssor Anthon would of itself bo a suffi- ir
cient to establish his rep itation as a schol- si
arof profounderudition, untiring industry, es
and interminable research. A thorough h<
acquaintance with the Germah language w
has given the Professor free access.to the
inexhaustible mines o! German literature, ir
which he has spread with an unsparing h
hand throughout the pagos of the diction- sf
arv: the works of modern tourists and ai
mglwimmwmwawbmmwww whhiii
geographors have been consulted, and se. 1
iectiomi have been made and inserted in t
the respective articles, which not only t
terest the reader, but^in many instances d
elucidate what was nitherto considered \
doubtful or obscure. The author has t
throughout his work been ever mindful of f
.he maxim of the Roman satirist,
iNil.dictu foedum, visque hacc litninia

Intra quae puerest.
The narratives of gross impurity, which
defiled thrt pages of Lempricre, are utterly
excluded by Professor Anthon, and we V
can say with confidence, that Anthon:s 1
Classical Dictionarv cannot fail to prove ^
acceptable to the ecclesiastic, the gentleman,
the schrlar, the professional man,
or the reader of whatever description, tl
who seeks for information upon subjects of tl
antiquity. c

person who'advanced the idea of editing a

thjg ult., having left Liverpool oa the 4th and
our bringing papers of tnat city up to the day
of sailing, and of London to the 3rd.
No intelligence whatever of the Steamship
President, had reached England, a!.
. though about two months, from the date*
tin * *
of her departure from New York, had
5 elapsed. No plausible conjecture can acun*
count for such a state of circumstances*.

to reduce the duties on foreign
Sugars and Timber, and, vhat is more
e important still to the grain growing weom
tions of our country, and gratifying to
lib- humanity, movements of the Ministry
jcs i seem to contemplate a revision of tfce
