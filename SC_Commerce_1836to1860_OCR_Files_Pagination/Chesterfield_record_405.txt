stretching through one sixth part of the ! f?

an area of two and a half million* of v

"and gratify the ambition or

u? h a Government, energy sickens and
nterprize dies, the largest natural adantages
will never elevate that nation
a the position she mi^ht otherwise attain.
The strongest of all Government-*,"
ays an American writer, ''is that which

urnishes no instance of a people p>seasing
a free Constitution, conquered

Here then, my fellow citizens, behold
nother of the resources of our country,
s free government. No language cm'm

dicitatinir ourselves on tliis subject.?

oldncss and originality, yet so much
aution and foresight, under whose aus-1
ices :lie Republic has advanced to such
nexampled prosperity with so little j
ecessity for amendment or addition, is
miracle in political history. An at- i
?ntive study of its details can awaken ,
o other sentiment than profound ad mi-!
ition of the superior wisdom of its au-.'
lors. The great leading principles!
hicli they have incorporated i:i this :
lan are, first: "That (lie sole end of all ;
lovernment ought to promote and scare
the happiness of the people,'' and
scondly: "That tiie people are the onlygitimate

arc ignorance and vice. If destitute

idleness and poverty, that theirsullrag

to the privileges, incapable of excrcisii

them an easy prey, and the throne

fs to be noticed?its historic recollections?
ir those events in which have been exhibited

Is l fleref is opened a foun'ain of perennial
flow, whose waters tire endued witn virtue
c, i fur more powerful than the inspiring
it- draughts of Helicon. Tho customs of all
of j people witness the universal conviction that
p- | tin re is strength in the national feeling, the
to ' * Jevat^d lone of patriotism derived from ill's
ic source. Barbarians gather at s'Med peri,
ct ods in solemn convocation, that their young
uiav hear the glorious deeds of their tribe
recounted by the aged, they lush to conflict,
animated by the wild-war song that
celebrates the heroic achievements of
their ancestors. In a state of society more
advanced, the same events form the theme
of i!ic brill .ds with which wandering mui~
cs strels awaken the enthusiastic patrio:ism of
'e their countrymen. Such was the Iliad of
Homer, which p-cit- u he exploits of the
1? early Grecian II ro? s.
u" Among the polytheistic N itions of amiquity,
many no upoihcoiis may be traced to
L's I the same source. The successful warrior,
->l' th^ virtuous patriot, the benefac or oC his
c? coun'ry, was elevated to the honours of a
ps god and his character embalmed forever in
'e lhe national religion, as nn example and in.
citement to all future generations. Annual

the events in !iisl< ry that were most
?n calculated to rivet the attachment of llie

sustained their descendants throughout ill

endured from the cruelty and treachery c

in the breast of our Revolutionary Patriot;
that rising above attachment to brethrei

To the Editor of the Nashville Union:
S:i? From, the many letters which have
n been recently.addressed to roe asking for an
0 expression of my views relative to the lead's
ing measures of the present administration of
it the General Government, some of which are
It from well known and respectable sources,
n representing that efforts are made in various
n quarters of the Union to incite a belief in the
public mind that my confidence in the present
Chief Magistrate has been impaired, it seems
0 to be proper that some steps should be taken
by me to undeceive those who are thus im-?
e posed upon. For this purpose, sir, I beg the
is favor of you to give a place in your columns
to this note which I trust will be as accepta.
is i b*e f? those who have written to me on the
aubject as a direct answer in the fortn of a
letter would be.
rc! From whatever cause or whatever authorL
I* ty, statements may be made representing me
in as having changed my views on the leading
to measures of the present administation, they
are unfounded and unjust. Of the wit dom and
l" importance of these measures, and particu.
' lady of that which aims at the establishment
by Congress of a fiscal agency for the Govern,
ment without the use or aid of Banks, time and
the fullest opportunity for reflection have left
not a doubt on my mind. And ihe ability
ie which Mr. Van Buren ffas manifested in developing
the bearing of t.lis great question,
. and ofits antagonist one, on the free institu.
tmns nf nnr eountrv. ant the firmness he has
> displayed in holding on tlni true interests of
the people when (here has been so much temp,
latum to compromise thein, entitle him in my
judgment to a rank not inferior to that of Mr.
Jofiers.ri or Mr. Madison as a patriot and
,j statesman.
With such opinions of the present Chief
Magistrate and of the measures to which he
u' has given his sanctions?opinions which I
have never failed to express when I have had
occasion to speak on the subjects?it is sur?
prising how any one could take up the idea a
that my confidence in him ha-J been impaired,
,s or that I had become indifferent as to the
[ ' choice to be mads at the next election bf.
' tween him and General Harrison. Looking
0 upon the laiter gentleman as the reprssenta[()
tive of Federal principles in the present con.
tir test and knowing that he has never been
is identified with the It'publican.party in any of
ts its great struggles against the influences yvhich
have been calculated to take power from the
1 people and jho States and give it to the Gen.
, oral Government, to suppose that 1 would for
,e a moment think of giving my support to such
n" an individual as a candidate for the Presidency
would be a mockery of all principle. *
In respect to the statements which have
been made in several of the newspapers of the
day that I disagree with many of my political
friends in the estimate they have formed of
Gen. Harrison's millitary men-it* I am n?t
*1- aware ol having said any Jiing to justify them,
c. having never admired Gen. Harrison as a
in< rnditary man, or considered him as possessing
the qualifies which constitute the commander
' ' of an army. I h ?ve looked at his political
m relations alone in the opinions I have formed
ly or expressed respecting his pretensions to
x- the Presidency, and the consequences which
e. would result to the country, should the su?
x frage of the people place him in that high
"? uilice.

obedient servant, * ~-v ~

Mr Dear General:?I address joo with
bs the fraukne.<s which one old fri nd may use to.
)j_ wards another. My object is to Icurn what
I you thiuk of the recent attacks on tho military
ch i racier of Gen. Harrison. I believe you were
y- in tho army in tho Wes?, in tho campaign of
?r- Tippecanoe: although I do not remember that 0^
h. you served with him aftor the declaration of war
e(| ag iinst Er.g'and, but as a military man aiul wbew
your judgement impartially, and when jho facte
wire recent, your opinion would bo of great val.!)
ue. If there bo any blot on his millitnry ftmr,
|)e it ought to bo known; if there be not, you will
, tool that an old soldier ought not to bo unjustly
and rudely attacked.
'lt! Gen. Harrison is before the country for tho
os Presidency. I do not know that we shall elect
ii<] him, but I can say, in your own language, my
u? dear General, that ' uc'll try."
I Yours with unceasing regard,

Mv Dear Sir:?I have tho honor to have ro.
ho r<>ivr>tl vnnr letter of yesterday requesting me to
U- slalo what I think of the recent attack* upon
r_ the niiPiuiry character of Grn. Ilariison. lit
answer, I can truly s ty that I hare noticed with
|S' j deep r.-gret, attacks not only on his well earned '
!Cr inillitary fame, bat also upon his privato and
r- moral character. My fiM acquainianhe with
|ie (i n, Harrison was in the yrsr 1811. 1 was on
I duty in the 4: h Regiment of Infantry, then com.
mandod by Col. Jolin P. Boyd?afterwards Gen.
1?s Boyd?under orders to proceed to Vincennes,
to and tlicro report to Governor Harrison. Wo
re did so. We remained at Vincennes some days,
j?. and united ourselves with tho Volunte?#S assotn.
r hlod there devoting our limited timo to purposes
? of organization and drill. We then toes tfp the
L ? lino of in irch for the Indian country, and prolie
cccdod by slow and cautious murclies, nntill wo
a; reached about seventy miles up tho Wabash to.
jn wards Tippecanoe, where wo lulled and threw
r up "a stockaded work, which we called Fort
0 Hairhon. 11 ire I remainoa until tho Array ro...
r)- turned from Tippecanoe, after tho battle,
o' Although I was not in tho battlo, ?till I took
; great interest in it; h id much conversation with
> l ail tlm ntlirors on their return; and made every
_ ! inquiry I could think of respecting thoir ir ovemouts
and encampments, the attack and defence
il and the operations the battle throughout?and
Co 1 made up my min I, unhesitatingly, that the
campaign h id been conduclod with great bravery
I skill an lju gment. and that nothing was left
L> uitiloiie, th it could be consistently with tho Goin
r-~~ real's express orders from the War Department,
rc which I saw and read. Nor have I ever known
j ir or hoard of any act of his, which has in the least ^
? degree, altered tho opinion I then formed ofhim.
I yyllad.l, that if I ever had any military skill,
I am moro indebted for it to (Jon. Harrison thah
to any other maw. Soon after tho battle I wroto
a letter to (Jen. Benjamin Pierce, late Governor
of New Hampshire?my military father, as I
called hiin?giving a somewhat detailed acconnt
=5 of tho campaign of Tippecanoo. That letter
was preserved hy Gen. P. and might now pro*.
.r* hably Ihj feiind among bis papers. If it is it&
,n existence it will sbo-.v what wore nty opinions
1(1, Kt that time, as would also several other letters
:ts then written hy ino to various friends. Iu those
days I never board that Gcu. Harrison was a
1 f coward or wore petticoats:
