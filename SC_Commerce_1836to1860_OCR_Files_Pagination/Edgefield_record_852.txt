:DE OCRATt' SONG.
Take your time, Miss Lucy."
at picked up my goose-quill
ow, to chant a little lay,
-Tsal about a. gatubler,
0dis nat3e is Henry Clay!
le wants to rule the country,
But.ie4halJl ot have his way'.
Solitlieyour taiv . Harry,
Take~youi'ae l'Harry Clay.
If-the provei6 ld betruj'ft
- -Eery dog must have his daj
We hope the fourth of March, will
Not be claimed by Harry Clay.
The Treasury will be ruined,
All his gambling debts to pay:
So bide your time, old Harry,
Bide your time old Harry Clay.
You want a Bank established,
To facilitate your play,
Dut ini this you'll be mistaken
lost sagacious Harry Clay!
We've crushed the hideous monster
For forever and a day:
So don't be a inguine. H1arry.
Don't be sanguine Harry Clay.
If the Emperor of Russia
Should banter you to play,
You'd stake our glorious Onion,
Yes you would old Harry Clay.
They say the gambler knows no bounds,
When money's in the way:
So clear the track, old Harry
Clear the track old Harry Clay.
What want you with a TarifT,
But to wrest the gold away
From a suffering nation's pockets,
And-to ganble it at p lay ?
We swear before high heaven,
Such a tax we ne'et shall pay:
So make vour mind ip, flarry.
Blake your mind up, Harry Clay.
Make way for POLk.! we warn you,
Your day has passed away,
So oft you've been defeated,
That at Ashland you should stay.
Whig doctrines are exploded
'It this enlightened day:
So be quite easy. Harry.
Be quite easy Harry Clay.
The blood ofyouthful Cilley
Never can lie washed away
You'll have to answer for it
At the nwful judgment day.
His wife died in a mad house,
And his orphan children say:
"We've been ruined by this iarry,
By this hateful Harry Clay !"
Friends! our country is in danger
If this gambler has his way,
We should rise in glorious union
And his onward progress stay.
Thea berei to Polk and freedomi!
Let us chant the glorious lay,
And consign to glorious lay,
And consign to dark oblivion,
The schemes of Henry Clay.
Thuiip;atron of the " sweat-rag!"
To this what dare you sany ?
Beyond all other things. you love
STogamble, Harry Clay!
Once again I nanst relpeat it,
Just to close any little lay,
Please take. your time, old Harry,
rake your time oldl Harry Clay!

.Effects ofja Per petual Day.-T he effeet
of perpetual day, upon the mind. feelines
:andl avocations of men, is thtus describedl
in the narrative of Bnecan's l~xpedition to
the North Pole. TIhe picture is wvell
drawn:
Nothing mnade so deep an impression
oui our senseR, as the chiange from niterna
tive day and aight 'to which we had been
habituated from our infancy, to the contan
ued daylight to whaich we were subjecteda
as soon we crossed the artic circle. WVhere
thae ground is but little troddean, even trifles
are interesting, ad I do not, therefore,
hesitate to describe the feelings with whicha
we regarded this change. The novelty
it must he admitted, wvaf very agreable
and the advantage of constanut daylight, in
an unexplored and naturally boisterns
sea, was too great to tallow us even to
wvish' for a return of the alterations above
alluded to; but thereluctance we felt to
leave the deck when the sun w as shiningI
bright upon our sails,, and retire to our
cabbiins to sleep, deprived us of manya<
hours of necessary res', and whetn we re
turned to the deck to keep our aight wiatch
if it miiy be so called, and still inal the sun
gilding' the, sky, it seemed as if thae day
wvotld never finish. What, therefore, first
promised to be so gratifying, soon threat
endd to become extremely irkeomne: and
would, indeed, have beern a serious incon:
venince had we'not followed the example
of the feathery tride, which wve daily oh
served wvinging their way to roost, wvith a I
clock work regularity, and retired to our
cabin at the proper htour, where shutting
out the rays of the suna, we obtained that
re pose which the exercise of our daties
required. At firer, it will no adouba appear
to ,many persons that constatnt daylight
must bo a valuable.artquisition inuevery
pountrjtbut a very little refieecionu will Ia
* think. tiesulficient to show that the re- c
verse is really the case, and to satisfy a
reflecting - mind that we cannot overrate
the blessings'we drive from the wholesotme ~
-alteration'of :labor and rest, which is in a
manner forced upoo us by the succession
of day and nighut.- lt- is impossible by (
removing to a high laiitude to witness that
