Dear Sir:?The following resolution 3(
and address to President Van Burcn were tli
reported to-day to the House of Repre- fd
sentalires by Mr. Whipple, by the ?e- CI
lectcommittee appointed for that purpose, Vl
and its adoption recommended. The re- il
port was agreed to: ai
Resolved\ by the House of Represents- t|
tires, the Senate concurring therein, That t]
** * r n
the following address to Mr. van uurcu, a
President of the United States, be adop- ti
ted by the General Assembly, and the n
Governor be requested to forward to the
President a copy of the same. n
To Martin Van Burf.n, s
President of the United States: l'
Sir:?The General Assembly of the ^
State of Missouri, sensibly impressed v
with the firmness, integrity, and patriot- ^
ism which have characterized your ad- j(
ministration as President of the United
Slates, on the approach of the termination
of the period for which you were ^
elected, respectfully tender to you their |
-.1 ?ippm. and unimpaired confi-j
acga.u, ? . M
dence. ^
It was at no ordinary period that the
unbought suffrages of a free people called }
you to the Presidential chair; and with
moral intrepidity, enlightened sagacity,
and sleepless vigilance, you have been '
faithful to every principle and impulse of ^
Democracy.
On your elevation to the Presidential ^
chair, our country presented the painful j
spectacle ot a nation convulsed with the
voilence of revolution?bloodless, yet
full of the murmurs, threats and malignant
passions of approaching anarchy?a tj
party the constant and consistent enemies
of Demoeracy?a party which under the
execrated name of Federalist, had been ?
crushed into nothingness by the the slow
yet steady advance of truth?which look- c
ed on the people as incapable of self u
government?which had fiercely opposed tl
the administration of Mr. Jefferson?
which had submitted to the brutal insults
of Great Britain, estimating even mer- ^
chants' goods higher than our sailors' 0
rights?-which had opposed our just war, tj
adding parricidal insults to their already w
bleeding country?which had submitted I lr
in silence to the treason of a Hartford L-r
Convention?which had sustained all the cj
errors, heresies and usurpations of the ^
administration of Joh Quincy Adams? ^
and which had opposed, with uncompro- fl
mising violence, all the measures of Gen. 0(
Jackson's triumphant administration, suddenly
usurp the time honored name of w
Whig, and allied to British capitalists and j(.
domestic stockjobbers, they have boldly ^
warred against the principes of Democra- (r
cy by the power of money, the corrup- V(
tions of the press, and the conspracies of
banking institutions. 0]
It is with pride that we rejoice in the CI
firmness with which you met the dangers ja
and attacks of the party; and it is with rf
pleasure that we point to your Inaugural S(
Address and your message to Congress, V(
convened under proclamation, as clo- j f,.
quent and unanswerable manifestations of, tl',
your attachment to the principles of Democracy.
ar
To mar the usefulness of your adminis- ar
tralion, and to impair the confidence of UJ
the people in it, the Federalists have not j)
scrupled to resort to the most ungenerous m
__j s ~i 1 r Aa_
SQU iUUl 1I1UUC9 Ml (inatni j?wwvii? uv- j.^
vdoperaents have exhibited to us a series as
of widely spread and extensive conspira*
cies against the purity of elections, and, vj
sustained by British money, in American |,?
banks, your enemies have been borne into pr
office, not by "irture of thp right of suffrage,
but by the vilest frauds upon it.
From the facts before us, we arc left to
infer that there has heen a secret and well su
organized system of bribery nnd corrup- W{
tion practised against the great mass of
the community by the leaders of the jy(
Federal party; and that the money which ^
has been used to purchase votes has been ^
furnished by those British capitalists who
have dictated a political charge to the (|e
State, and who have advocated, in their
subsidized American presses, and by their W(
tools in Congress, the odious policy and
th8 inglorious slavery of an assumption go
liw?a Jaw which, in Grst degrading us, mj
renders us the willing serfs of a foreign
Power. .. ' ' an
During your administration the separa- gt
tlon of the Government from banking institutions
has been achieved, and the mo- t|)(
ney of the people lias been withdrawn to
from irresponsible corruptions, and wise- ejt
Jy placed unden the management of their va'
own immediate servants. This Indepen- t|1(
dent Treasury law is a second Declaration it,
ot independence, caicuiaieu 10 restore Mje
our constitutional currency of gold and ne
silver, intended to protect us from the rapine,
frauds, panics, and usurpations of
the moneyed aristocracy of the land, and
is faithful to the early usages ol our Go- t|l(
vernment. In support of this salutary .j1(
measure you have encountered the insults, [jl(
invectives, and denunciations of disap- (ja
pointed malice and political bankruptcy;
but you have fearlessly braved the storm, feI
and have never, for a moment; betrayed jn,
the confidence reposed in you by a free (ll)
people, nor swerved from the path of ?f
their intei est. as
As the representatives of a slavchold- tj0
iig State, we cordially approve your
manly and candid course on the subject of ;lll
Abolition. The pledges which you gave
have been fearlessly redeemed: and under t|,
the protecting shield of the veto power, VJ
placed in your hands by the Constitution, tj,.
we have felt that our proporty was secure
from that fanatical pira-y, which would
vade llie halls of Congress, and which, n
it for your firmness, would have seized E
i the post office as an engine for the tlis- c
iminaiion of its treasonable designs. On b
lis subject you have elevated yourself t
r above the contemptible intrigues of i
leclinnccring policy, while you have gi- t
en the whole force of administration to e
te protection of our property, and the t
id of our violated Constitution against
te operation of a party which is led hy
te World's''Convention" of England,
nd is rendered formidable by its associaon
with the capitalists of London, and i
lany of the Federalists of our own land. i
In your administration we have rocog- i
ised that strict construction of the Con- I
litution, and that regard for the rights of
lie Slates which have ever been the poli- i
y and practice of the Democrats; and <
re have full and implicit confidence in <
our hostility to the system of internal
nprovements advocated by the Federal- i
>ts. A similar confidence has been re- I
osed by us in your dauntless opposition
a the American System, (as that tariff
as been called.) which has for its object
be vassalage of the Slates, and the ruin
f our agriculturists. And our warmest
jelings of esteem have been extended to i
ou for respect of the rights and your <
ympathy for the pursuits of the basely I
landered pioneers of the West. To your
olicy on the subject of pre-emptions we I
re deeply indebted. The whole West
as been benefited by the measure. In I
be protection which this law gives to i
oirrionlhlpp hn? ndvAtlCed
and in hand with the tide of population i
rhich swells througho.it our borders. ?
At no period of our history has our <
ounlry enjoyed more prosperity than in i
fie last four years. By your wise and
iidicious course the public faith has been
reserved inviolate, and simplicity and i
conomy have characterized the managelent
of the various departments of gov- I
rnment. The post offices have been I
'idely extended, our navy increased, and
ibcs of numerous Indians have been .
eaceably removed. With foreign potv- i
ra our relations have been of the most i
iendly character. Indemnities have been i
btained for our citizens from abroad, and
le very few difficulties which have existed
ith foreign powers during your adrr.inis- i
ation are in a train of adjustment. The
iterests of the tobacco planter have been I
herished in the appeals which have been i
lade to the Courts of Austria and France,
nd on whatever distant sea our flag has
oate l; it has borne with it the glories of
ur Republic.
Ills with proud feelings that we have
itnessed the large popular vote which
i the recent Presidential election, has t
een given to you. VVe,feel thatvou have s
iumphed, and that the victory is with '
our friends. Unstained by fraud, and tin- J
irrontpd hv the intritroes of the foreign
"! J *0 ' *" V
r domestic moneyed power, the Demo- i
alic parly has nobly borne itself in the *
te struggle; and, although you are not 1
!-elected, we are confident that the sober 1
icoitd thougnt of the people will be with i
au. Ina similar crisis the Democratic 1
lrty rallied around Mr. Jefferson, and c
iumphantly elected him.
In the name of our common country, J
id with feelings excited into vigilance i
id action by the frauds which have been j
sed to defeat you, we trust that our
emocratic friends throughout the Union
ay welcome your name as a signal for r
newed exertion, and rally around you
the representative of Republican purity.
re have no fears for the result?We in- l<
te our adversaries to the contest; for we a
ive an abiding b?lief that Democratic
iuciples must and ever will succeed. t

WAR MOVEMENT IN MAINE. I
On the 3rd instant, resolutions on the
bject of repelling British aggression, a
^re offered in the House of Represenlares,
and referred to the committee on the
>rth Eastern Boundary. We learn from y
e Portland Argus of the 15lh inst. that
cse resolutions were taken up by the u
mate on the 13th, and after being aincn- e
<1 by inserting ?1,000,003 instead of a
100,000, for the defence of the State, p
;re rcferied to the same committee.
Mr. Davis then offered the following re- IV
Ive, which was also referred to the com- y
itlee on the North Eastern Boundary:-?
"Resolve for repelling foreign invasion u
d providing for the protection of the s

"Be it Resolved, That the Presideht oT y

this state from the present heavy q

A LEAP YEAR STORY.
Popping the Question.?"Bui why don't
foil get married?" said a bouncing girl, i
ivith a laughing eye, to a smooth faced inlocent
looking youth who blushed up to
the eves at the question.
"Well, I?" said the youth, stopping
short with a gasp, and fixing his eyes up- j
on vacancy with a puzzled and foolish
expression.
"Well, go on, yon what?" said the
fair cross questioner, almost imperceptibly
inclining nearer to the young man.
"Why, I?0, pshaw, I don't know!"
"You do, I say you do now, come, I
want to know."
"O, I can't tell you"?
"I say you can. Why you know I'll
never mention it, and you may tell me of
course, you know, for haven't I always
been your friend?"
"Well, *^ou have, I know," replied
the beleagured youth.
"And I'm sure I always thought you
iked me," went on the maiden in tender
ind mellow accents.
"O, I do upon my word?yes, indeed I
In. Maria." said the unsophisticated
youth, very warmly, and he found that'
Maria had unconciously placed her band
in his open palm.
Then there was a silence.
"And then?well John?" said Maria,
dropping her eyes to the ground.
"Eh! Oh?well?" said John dropping
bis eyes and Maria's hand at the same moment.
"I'm pretty sure you love somebody
Tohn; in fact," said Maria, assuming
igoin a tone of raillery, "I know you're
n love, and John why don't you tell me
ill about it at once?"
"Well, I"~
"Weill! O you silly mortal, what is
there to be afraid of?"
"O, it aint because I'm afraid of anything
at all; and I'll?well now Maria, I
oill tell you." t
"Well now, John?"
uj I?
41 El.?"
..j .?
"Yes."
"I am in love!?now don't tell?you
voni, will you?" said John, violently
leizing Maria by the hand, and looking in
ler face with a most imploring expression.
"Why, of course you know, John, I'll
lever breathe a word of it?you know I
vont, don't you John?" This was spocen
in a mellow whisper, and the cherry
ips of Maria were so near John's ear
vhen she spoke, that had he turned his
lead to look at her there might have oc:urred
an exceedingly dangerous collision.
"Well, Maria," said John, "I've told
rou now, and so you shall know all about
t. I have always thoughts great deal of
?ou, and"?
"Yes, John."
"I am sure you would do anything for
ne that you could"*?
"Yes, John, you know I would."
"Well, I thought so, and you don't'
;now how long Tve wanted to talk to yon
ibout it."
"I declare John, I?you might have
old me long ago if you wanted, for I'm
tire I never was angry with you in my
ife."
"No, you wasn't; and I have often felt
great mind to; but"?
It's not too late now you know, John."
"Well, Maria, dp you think I'm too
oung to get married?"
"Indeed I do not, John; and I know it
t'ould be a good thing for you loo, for
very body says the sooner young people
re married trie better, wncn tney are
rudent anil inclined to love one another."
"That's just what I think; and now,
laria, I do want to get married, and if
ou'll just?"
"Indeed I will, John, for you know I
'as always partial to you, and I'Ve said
o often behind your back."
"Well I declare I've all along thought
ou might object, and that's the reason
've been always afraid to ask you.'1
"Object! no, I'd die first; you may ask
f mo just any thing you pleasei"
"And v?u'll grant it?"
"I will,"
"Then, Maria, I want you to pop the
uestion for me to Marv Sullivan, for?"
? What!"
"Eh?"
"Do you love Mary Sullivan?"
"O, indeed I do with all my heart!"
"I always thought you were a fool."
"Eh!" J
"I Say you're a fool, and yoo'd belter ,
o home, your mother wants you! O, j
on?you?you?stupid'/" exdlaimed the (
lortified Maria in a shrill treble, and she <
ave poor John a slap on the cheek that ;
jnt him reeling. It was noonday, and |
... rio/,iar?a bfl asw mvriads of stars ,
n auiMi uwi/iu. v.. ... ?y ,
ashing around him, more than he over
tiv before in the night lime. Poor Maria,
"Never told her love,
But let concealment, liko a worm i' the bud,
Prey on her damask cheek." , (
Thus, alas how often are the germs of |
oung affection cast away! For it is but |
>o true, as David Crockett beautifully (
stresses it, i
"The course of true lovo never did ran smooth.1" (
Jin honorable Example.?The foll0Tr?i3
ing we find in the Maysvflle Eagle. It is
related of Mr. Craddock, a member of
the Kentucky Senate from the counties of
Hardin and Meade:
"Sir, (said Mr. C.) what I have said
here to-day has been said in a rough way,
and, if it has wounded any Senator, I
hope he will attribute it to no Unkind feelings,
but to ray want of the polish of education.
Sir your Superintendent of Common
Schools has said that there are many
men of family in this Commonwealth who
can neither read nor write, and it is but j
too true. My own marriage bond has
my mark to it; and my son who now sits
in the other House, was a stout boy when
I learned to write."
[Mr. C. is now not only a respectable
Senator, but a good lawyer. What more
need be said in his praise?]
Beaux of Former Times.?"We question
whether the celebrated Beau Brum
mell, and even the equally celebrated
Romeo Coates, were not mere Quakers
in their dress, compared with sopie ofthe
distinguished dressers of the former days.
Sir Walter Raleigh wore a while satin
pinked vest, close sleeved to the wrisl;
over the body a brown doublet, finely1
flowered and embordered with pearl. In
the feather of his hat, a large ruby and
pearl-drop at the bottom of the sprinjr, in
place of a button; his trunk ojv breeches,
with his stockings and ribbtm garters,
fringed at the end, all white; and buff
shoes, with white ribbon. On great court
days his shoes were so gorgeously covered
with Drecious stones, as to have ex
ceeded the value of 6,600/.; and he had a
suit of armor of solid silver, with sword
and belt blazing with diamonds^ rubies,
and pearls. King James's favorite, the
Duke of Buckingham, could afford to
have his diamonds tacked so loosely on,
that when he chose to shake a few off
on the ground, he obtained all the fivmc
he desired from the pickers-up, who were
generally less Dames de la Cour; for our
Duke never condescended to accept what
he himself had dropped. His cloaks
were trimmed with great diamond buttons,
and diamond hat-bands, cockades, and
ear-rings, yoked with great ropes and
knots of pearls. He had twenty-seven
suits of clothes made, the richest that embroidery,
lace, silk velvet, silver, gold,
and gems, could contribute; one of which
was a white uncut velvet, set over, both
suit and cloak, with diamonds, besides a
great feather, stuck all over with diamonds,
as were also his sword, girdle,
hat, and spurs. When the difference in
the value of money is considered, the
sums thus ridiculously squandered in dress
must have been prodigious.
A Glorious Record.?At New London
Connecticut, the following inscription is
found on a grave stone. The records of
ancient Rome or Greece do not exhibit a
nobler instance of patriotic heroism:
- > ? - i? -i-?ot innn rn.
"Un the J5Utn irciooer, woi, ivw
glish fell upon that town with suLord. and
fire?700 Americans defended th?fort for
a whole day; but in the evening,'about 4
o'clock, it was taken. The commander
of the besieged delivered up his sword to
an Englishman, who immediately stabbed
him; and all his comrades were put to the
sword. A line of powder was then laid
from the magazine of the fort to the sea,
there to be lighted, thus to blow the fort
in the air. William Holman, who lay not
far distant, wounded by three strokes of
the bayonet in his body, beheld it, and
said to one of his wounded friends, who
was also still alive, ' Wc will endeavor to
crawl to this line; we will completely wet
the powder with our blood?thus will wc,
with the little life that remains to us,
save the Fort aid magazine, and perhaps
a few of our comrades who are only
wounded." He alone had strength to accomplish
this noble design. In his thirtieth
year he died on the powder which
he overflowed with his blood. His friends
and seven of his wounded companions by
that means had their lives preserved."
After this simple narrative, are the following,
in large characters, ''Here rests
William IIolman."
A Ndw Town Affair.?The inhabitants
of a town in Connecticut, it is said,
have voted that, whereas the selling ot
rum is profitable to the seller and unpro-|
filable to the town, the town will take the
business into their own hands. They accordingly
appointed a man to sell spirits
for them, voted him a salary; ordered the
select men to furnish the rum, and directed
the agent to register thejname of every
man who bought the rum and the quantity
bought.?Journal of Commerce.
u?ou ought to be ashamed of yourself."
How very common, and at the same time
how very absurd it is for a girl, after she
has been kissed by a chap, to turn round,
pout her pretty lips as though she was
mad, and say, "you ought to be ashamed
of yourself," when every one must know <
she means nothing by it. ft,s a'i non*
3ense, girls, to make remarks of the kind I
and for using them. Why don't you come i
right otit, like the yankee girl who was i
kfssed by her lover, and tell him "you i
Jars'nt do that again." That's the way.

THE CAMDEN DEBATING CflUB,
This Association celebrated its thirteenth anniver- ^
sary on Thursday evening last. Tho members
marched in procession from their Hall, at 7 o'clock,
IU (.110 iJaj/blOb VllUibllf IUW1 uu I||Q
address to the Throne of Grace by the Rev. C. M. [,
Breaker, an Oration, on the influence of literary
associations in promoting the permanence of our j
Federative republican institutions, was delivered by
J. C. West, one of the members of. the Society;
Previous to the prayer, as also before and after the
oration, an amateur band, (led by Mr. Dens,) who '
kindly volunteered their services for the occasion,
performed several pieces of music in a. style that
would do credit to professors. Mr. Denk, we take {?
this occasion to say, is an exquisite performhr' and &
richly merits thepatronago of our citizens. J--:
After the exercises at theCburch were concluded,
the Club, with a number of invited guests, repaired
to Gjfford's Hall, and partook of a most sumptuous
supper, furnished by Mr. Gifford. We can' safely
say that we never sat down to a table more bountifully,
or more elegantly furnished; The room was
handsomely decorated with evergreens, anefbrifliant.
ly lighted. Tho Temple of Minerva graced one end
of tho room, with the goddess herself standing at the
entrance, divested of the usual repulsive and
threatening aspect with which she is represented!
and apparently with a smile inviting the votaries of '
wi"dom and the liberal arts-to entor. :,0 * ?. \y<4
Tho re was one feature in this entertainment which
we must not omit to notice. Like the list anniversary
celebration of this Society, it was conducted on, '
total abstinence principles. , Itfo wine or spyj^uons
liquors wero introduced, and we think the $ct is
now placed beyond all question, that they are not
necessary to add to the pleasures of.social inter. ^
course. In the course of the evening a number of
sentiments wero given, a few of which have- ;bceu
