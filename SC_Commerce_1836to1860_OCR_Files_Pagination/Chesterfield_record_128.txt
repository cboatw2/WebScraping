\\v proceed to present briefly, th 'views v
which have occurred to us in relation t*> t! e c
questions which yon required us to investi- n
gate and report on. " a
On the comparative advantages of the k
two modes of transportation, by water and r
bv Rail Roads, a single observation issufli !a
fient. It ts very common to read and to j a
hear of general rules, and universal cxperi- i ii
. once, on this subject, but a moment's reflec- i v
' . tion will show that it is preposterous to assert; v
that anv- rule derived from experience in I
one case, can be nccessar.lv true when tip- e
plied to alt. " j(
The facility of transportation coasts s in | \
rapid ty and cheapness with which it is of- j t
fecf?si; and comparison of the facilities of j r
different methods of transportation is very 1 r
much modified, by tbc local circumstances j [
of the country *o which it is intended to re-' <
tor. The idea is easily illustruteii bv an (t
example. Two -inland towns- are equally j J
remote from the sea-port wlirclr furnishes I <
merchandize, and is ilie outlet to fhe exjK>rta- j <
*/ lion's of l)o:h: the* one communicates with 11
. the sca-port through the medium of a navi.-j {
gable stream, in ten days, the other in five:, j
hod) arc competitors for the trade of an in-1?
tcrior country equally convenient to them; |
the latter of course has the advantage in the ; <
facilities of trasportation and must ou'slrip \
the o:her in trade, but hy this one, by the j
consYuc'ion of a Rail Road, niay?omtnu* c
nicate daily-with the sea-port, though at an f
increased expense, and must necessarily I'f
1 draw to its market the"larger portion of the : j
produce of the interior, and* sell a proper
tionatclv increased. quantity of merchan- |
dize: it Incomes ;i qnes ion, whether the \
beneficial results of this improved method Y
of transportation will.remunerate the great- (
cr expanse with which it is attended; and in ji
general, the deliberation will not be long, : t
nor its conclusion doubtful. (
The profit derived from - tlie additional s
quantity of merchandize sold, will bo fount! c
amply sufficient to cover this enlarged ex- jppnse
ofgetting it: while, from the facilities ,.r
.of rapid and immediate exportation, the 1
g merchant will bo enabled to-buy the" staple t
productions of the country wi h more liber- ti
" . alitv"to the producer, and less danger to him- , !i
self from the fluctuations in the foreign mar-j
ket. Water transportation mav be in! *|
general, the c!icapesf, hut it often happens, n
i - >i i.v?
thru cheapness is 1101 souesirawe as rupiuuy. o
" It is obvious^ therefore, that any .abstract f
Comparison mji9t !jc extremely fallacious,j p
and the inquiry must, in all cases, retbr to n
the expediency of the improvement under j c
iye circumstances in which it is proposed, ji
We believe, that whatever-may be the rude ; p
i ' and has'y opinions of the ignorant and un- c
- rejecting, as to the expediency of our pro- p
J jeeted Rail Road, there can he no doubt in i s
'he minds of intelligent persons .who have J
given the subject a very slight considera-! (.
_ lion. It is true "that nature has afforded the , j,
facilities of a tolerably navigable stream to 1 n
it '
a portion of the country interested in our j a
undertaking, but it is becoming daily metre s
appareriMbat thePecdeo is an inadequate ()

give for produce the highest price which*

versity of interest between the merchant,
and the agriculturest: and whatever advan- j i
tagc the one will derive from improvement t
m the methods of transport, is sure to be 11
telt bv the other in their K liest extent. ! i
The delay which occurs in getting the t
Cotton of the Foedee country to Charleston s
or Now York, where it is intended to be j 1
sold, has been the most serious obstucle to ; t
riio prosperity of the merchants, and in many ; i

late. The gross receipts from passengers
eight and mail carriage is $1.13,050. Ait
llowance of $90,000 is made for current
xpensos, which is more than two-thirds oi
tc whole income. We would remark in
as'sing that we'have before our eves the
ist Annual Report ofthe Petersburg Rail
load Company, whose expenditure, for an
leome of $107,018 83, was but $45, 33U
9, much less than half. The cxpendi ure
onsists mainly, if not entirely, in the money
lid out in elfecting transportation, in fuel,
ibor, Arc. and in repairing the -wear and
jar. The sum must, therefore, bear near.
v a fixed proportion to the income ; for il
he expense of conveying a large quantity
f transportation and repairing the conse.
uent wear of ihe Road and Engines, be
ery considerable, the receipts must be of a
orrespon Jing magnitude ; with this only
txception, that " a long Rail Road can be
rorked with greater relative economy thar
. short one." There is no reason, there,
are, why our expenses on a road of eighty
rules should exceed two-thirds of the re.
eipts while on the Petersburg Rail Road o
10 miles, it is less than half.- We are con.
trained to think the allowance excessive
or the probability derived from reason ant
experience is, that the expenses of our Roat
vould be proportionably less than on tha
Jluded to. Admit it not to be so, however
mdonly sufficient to cover all possible ex
lenses, the residue of the income will'vieh
l clear and unfailing dividend of more thai
even per cent. But can the profits dcriv*.
:d from the work immediately after its com
iletion remain stationary ? It is unreason
ible to suppose. But it is the prospective
riew of its operations that lias excitocl out

At the last session qf Congress, an npj
propriation was made for a survey of the
Atlantic coast, \v?tl? the view of ascertaining
f the practicability of opening au inland water
communication between Norfolk and
j Charleston. The examination has been
3 commenced under the superintendence of a
. , distinguished officer of the U. S. Corps of
r j Engineers, and it is. confidently believed
j that the result of the survey will be very
I favorable to the undertaking. Indeed so
p eminently is the nature of the coast adapted
, to the improvement, and so important are
the commercial and political advantages of
j such a communication, that it is a matter of I
some surprise that it lias not, at an 'earlier j

[ j men?, or of the capitalists who have been so
' ! industriously seeking now modes of investj
ing their surplus funds. As a medium of.
' 1 commercial communication, it will combine !
' i the rapidity and safety of the Rail Road with
1 i the cheapness of water transport; and as an J
j auxiliary of defensive operations on the coast
! in time of*war, it is of such incalculable
value, that in these days of liberal construe'
fion, the right to make appropriations not
otily for the survey but for the actual accomplishment
of it,.may be very easily embraced
in the incidental powers of the Gov.
crnment. A Canal through the Dismal
| Swamp, opening into the Sounds which exj
I tend along tho coast of North Carolina, and
tare so well prWec'ed by its numerous Capes,
j will afford fair S.cam Boat navigation for
J considerably more than hiflf the distance,
with a very small expenditure in removing
1 shoals, a chain of Cannals thence to the
; Cape Fear River, and thenceto the Wacarrutw,
of no great length, and, from proxirrt1
i:y to the coast, of comparatively small la.
bor and expense, will connect the Soiinds
with the finest navigable stream in the Souih'
j eru country, which runs parallel with the
'; coast for a distance of more than fifty miles.
f | It_ will, of course, afford to us nil the ad.
i vantages to be expected from having such
1 a channel of communication wiih the Mid'
die States pass bv our Depot. On these
advantages it is unnecessary to enlarge.

I chiefly in reference to Northern commerce |
' j unci travel; but does it not occur to you that j
I there is another view,'the. consideration of j
II which calls to its aid not only the interest |
r \ but the patriotism of every South Carolinian?
: With an ancient and large sea' port, whose
1 geographical position would point it out to
a stranger as necessarily the importing town
for the whole Southern country; the wealth,
j intelligence and hospitality of whose citizens
f have always been the pride and boast of the
State ; with a species of labor superior for
?i cheapness and efficiency to that which is
' employed in the Northern States; with a
' soil rich and fruitful in the production of
* the commodity which constitutes the medium
* of exchange for the necessaries and luxur-1
ies of life obtained from every portion of the ,
' globe, and the great demand for which, in ,
1 foreign markets, has so long maintained the ;
balance of trade in favor of the U. States, j
I ?hosv can the fact be accounted for, that j
j the people ofSoutli Carolina, the very mcr-'
J j chantsof Charleston, surrounded bv so many]
| advantages for an immediate intercourse i
i with foreign nations, should still conduct its j
I trade almost entirely through the medium.ofj
' ! Northern cities ? We send our Cotton for j
i Northern speculation to pick upon, before'
' [ it goes to the Factory, and are basely con-,
5 i tent to pay tribute at the counters of New.
II York merchants for the very merchandize |
; which we might buy in foreign markets, I

) j could possibly do. What cause for humili-;
i iation and reproach ! . But what is the re- j
t nicdy ? Shall we hang down bur heads!
, and blush, and still quiteiy cling to our!
- shame? No. The pride of the State is cx-j
cited, the spirit of enterprise is abroad, and
i the period is not uis'ant when Charleston
. will assert the privileges of her position, and, j
?; ; vindicating her right to all the advantages ,
J vvh cii nature has conferred on her wUlj
a*.iiie for th? mv.tMh? of the pas? hv lite
pervading.. benefits which her future prosperity
will diffuse over the whole Slat-4.
The ultimate success of the Chnrler'on
and Cincinnati Rail Road is no longer the
subject of scepticism and ungenerous prophecies
of faction. It must-succeed, and its
effect on the co nmcrce of Charleston, in
constituting itthegreat emporium of South
crn and Western trade, is as certain as the
uniform and undeviatiiig effect of any physical
or moral cause can be.
In this event, fhe merchandize of South
and North Carolina- must of course he
bought there. The produce of the Country
must be sent there in return, and the Cheraw
and Waco maw Rail Road will do the
transportation of a district ofcoun'ry treble
in extent to that which now depends on the
navigation ofthe Peedee. And it'tliis*hope

i would most willingly identify the success o
| the two undertakings, and abide the result.
.With regard to the. physical -prncticnbili:
ty of our projecS the opinion of Mr. White
1 is relied on with great confidence as more
assuring to the .community than any opinion
that we would express. There is proba.
bly no section of country of equal extent in
the Atlantic States, over which a Rail Road
could be constructed at so small an expense,
whether we regard the absence of natural
obstructions, or the cheapness and excellence
of the necessary, materials. Witli
the exception of the Greataiid Little Peedees,
there is scarcely a single water course
the whole route which deserves .consideration
as an item indie estimates of cos'. Timi
her of the very bes: kind, for the wooden
| supers: ructure, is convenient to every point.
| and will cost liitle more than tiie mere lubot
of cutting and hewiog. . *
The surface of the country is almost ti
perfect level, and the soil so light that the
excavations and embankments necessary to
remedy occasional inequalities, are of conn
parat vely trifling expense.
On the whole, it is the unequivocal opinion
of your Commissioners, that the pro.
jected Rail Road* from the town ofCher.iw
to the Wacamawis highly expedient and
practicable in every point of view.
And now, having discharged the duties
you were pleased to assign to us, imperfect,
ly we are aware, but with zeal and with the
best ability we possessed, your Commissioners
beg leave, in conclusion, to address
you a few words on the course to be pur
sued ai thispeculiaccrisis ofaffairs.
' Less than.flvc months ago, wc assembled
to consider the propriety of undertaking a
work of ereat and acknowledged public
utility. At that time, and for several years
antecedent to it, our State had enjoyed an
unexampled degree ofcommercial and agri.
cultural prosperity, and the zeal and.cnergy
of her citizens in the institution of works ol
public improvement, was beginning to be
proportionate -to the extent of her resources
and the manifest wants of her
commerce. We felt then, that the
Peedee country had the ability, we knew
it had the determination, to prosecute
successfully, an undertaking so loudly demanded
by the necessities of its existing
commerce, so fruitful of the elements of new
wealth and increased prosperity.
But the aspect of affairs has changed J
It little matters what was the cause whether
the bad policy of an infatua'ed government,
the rash spirit of overtrade and* speculation,
or an inherent defect and tendency to derangement
in the monetary system of the
country; whether either, or all of these
cadses combined, have produced the effect,
it is certain that the country labors under
pecuniary embarrassment, wholly unprecedented
jn the annals of its finance. True,
the difficulties did not commence here, and
have not been felt by us in rhe full extent
of the disastrous ruin and bankruptcy which
had spread far and wide over the larger'portion
of the confederacy. But so closely interwovon
are our commercial relations, so
nicely constituted is our monetary system,
that the derangement of a single part must
dis'urb the operations of the -whole machinery.
We could not, therefore, reasonably
expect to escape entirely, the pervading misfortunps
of the-country. . But happily, we
have had so li tis connection with the fiscal
agents of the Government, and have been
so slightly infected with the mania of speculation,
that we Have participated in these
embcrrasshients only in such a degree as
was inevitable from our commercial relation's
with those States in. which they originated,
and where they have inflicted such
overwhelming calamity on every class of
society. \V'e have no fear that they can
become aggravated with us. and their only
effect will he a temporary depression of
trade and a slight restraint of the resources
-i i. mi. ? ... ? ;
WHICH w umu iwiv?;gi?*ji us uu iiiiiiicuui,^
ability commensurate with tlte zeal and energy
with which we have commenced our
works of Internal Improvement.
What, under these circumstances, will he
the conduct of the intelligent and enterprising
community, whose in'erest are so deeply
involvedin the issue of our undertaking ?
Will it yield to the apparent difficulties of
the times, or will it proudly show itself superior
to the influence .of foreign misfortune
or folly ?
We do not pause for a icpl v. Assured by
the energy and fortitude which has always
characterized our State, we confidently believe
that the present embarrassments, arising
from no fault of our own, will onlv s:imuO
# ' f
late our fellow citizens to renewed exertions
to accomplish a work which will assist in
elevating the prosperity of our beloved State
above the control of adventitious circumstances.
We repent it, our resources, tliQjgli embarrassed,
arc not diminished ; our ability,
though temporarily suspended, is not impairid.
Let us then with stout hearts and
firm determination, nerve ourselvos' to ih'c
unicriaking and resolve that it shall be accomplished.

I CULTURE OF ONIONS. |
j Willi some few exceptions, onions arc
! usually raised south of New England, from
" /?
sell.s grown in the autumn of the previous
year, a general impression prevailing ihat
they cannot he matured from seed the same
season. - This opinion we know from ex*
perience to bit erroneous, and as such belief
has interfered materially with the cultivation
of this excellent vegetable, we deem
; it our duty to state the result of a .small
experiment we made the present season,
with a view of testing whetheronions could
. or could not be grown from seed the same
. .season.
. On a small bed in our garden contigu.
ous to our kitchen,we caused the suds made
7 s
| through the last winter to be thrown. Early
v the last spring we had the bed dug up and
.. thoroughly^pulverized, then spread over it a
? slight dressing of unleached ashes, which
f was raked in. We then laid off the bed
in drills 12 inches apart, and sowed white
onion seed therein, as thinly as the operar
, fion could be performed with .the hand.?
, As the young onions became fit, to use, We
thinned out the patch, leaving, those that
remained .about 4 inches apart.- On the
( 14th of this month, the onions were gaiherj
ed, and we had the pleasure of finding that
they were fully as large as those ich had
| been raised "from sets of last fall's growth.
One which we measured was inches in
circumference, a size large enough for all
culinary purposes. . .
We will venture upftyi the assertion, that
if suitable soil be selected, and the ground
be well manured, that onions can not only
( be raised, hut matured from seed sown,in
i All tlint is rpfuiisite to insure a
! good crop is to plant at the proper distance
in the rows, thin out earl vj keep the ground
well stirred around the roots, and the bed
L clean front weeds. .With proper care we
! believe .that 100 bushels of onions may
be raised on an acre, - which at the - price
they bring in -the market -would prove a
crop sufficiently lucrative to satisfy any but
a mind inordinately imbued with avarice.

I Spring wheat.?A number ofgentlemcn,
residing in Augusta county, last.npi'ing procured
and sowed small'quantities of the
Italian or Spring Wheat. The Staunton

Spring .IVhcat an I Baden Corn!"?A
gentleman in Washington wri cs tints to his
friend in this city:
" 1 write to inquire how ypur spring
wheat succeeded. I have hud a line crop
in Indiana. My son writes that we shall
have 30 bushels an acre, and the quality
very fine. The land was sward, ploughed
in 1836, and- the wheat harrowed in last
May or the close of April. 1 have 200
I bushels o.i 7 acres.
My Baden Corn is doing well. Some
stalks have 11 ears on them : many stalks

Button Com.?On examing some of our
cars of .Dutton corn on the 17th ins ant,
we were pleased to find the grain perfectly
! hard, requiring nothing but a little-drying
to fit them for grinding?The advantage of
of growing this variety ufier ?a year of
scarcity can be'duly appreciated by agriculturists.
From our experience we are
justified in believing that two crops could be
grown in the same season in part of Virgin.

Beef Sour.?The best parts for this
purpose nre theleg or shin, or a piece .of
the middle of a brisket of beef, of about
eight pounds weight; put it into a soup-pot
or deep stewpan, with cold water enough to
. cover if, and a quart over; set it on a quick
fire to get the scum up, which remove as it
rises : then put in two carrots, two turnips,
two leeks, or two large onions, two heads
of celery, and a faggot of parsley ; set the
ppt by the side of the fire to simmer very
gently, til1 'he meat is just tender enough
to eat; this will require, about four or five"
hours.
Put a carrot, a turnip, a large onion, and
a head or two of celery, into the soup whole

'cold, then cut them into small squares-;
when the beef is done take it out carefully;
take off the fat, and put the vegetables that
are cut into the soup, the flavor of which
yon may heighten, by adding a table spoon{
ful of ca'sup.
If a Thickened Soup is preferred, take
four large table-spoonsful of the clear faf
from the top of the pot, and lour spoonsful
of flour ; mix it .smooth together, . then by
degrees s ir it well into the soup, which
simmer for toil minutes, longer at least;
skim it well, and add the vegetables and
season rug the same as directed in the clear
soup.? Tennessee Farmer.

Tomatoes.Mrs/Child gives ll?e following
directions for cookin'g this valuable vxge-;
1 tabic
44 Tomatoes should be skinned by pourjng
boiling water over them.- After they " *
are skinned, they should be stewed half an
hour, in tin, with alft;le salt, a small bit of
butter, & a spoonful of water." This method
; is for sauce to eat with roast meat for dinner. . .
I When plucked greert,- tomatoes make ail
exccllent-pickle.* An excellent catsup may be
| made ofthenl,when ripe,intlie following manI
ner. 44 The vegetable should be squeezed
1 up in the band, salt put to them ; and set. .
by for twenty four hours, after being passed.
i through a seiye, allspice, pepper, mace, gar1
lie, and whole mustard seed should .be added.
It should be boiled down one third,
arid bottled after it is cool.: No liquid is
. necessary, as the tomatoes are very juicy, i
A good deal ol salt and spice is necessary
1 to keep the catsup well." It is delicious .
I with roust moat ; and a cup full adds much
I to the richness of soup and chowder. The
garlic .should bo taken out boforc the catsup
j is bottled." *
The Largest Snake Yet.?As Mr. Elia- '
kin.Thomas was returning on Saturday
week,, from an excursion on the CntskilT
mountain, he !?card a great rus-ling among .
the leaves close by and presently the start,
ling sound of rattles, apparently ofan enor
mous snake. He s^ood momentarily upon
his guard ; ' and it was well he did so, for on
looking about him, he presently discovered
the appaling sight of a rattle .snake, with
his head at least four feet from the ground,
his bo ly coil above Coil, lirs eyes flashing
fire, his skin every minute changing color,
and his long fangs displayed, as in the very
act-of springing upon his intended victim.

a moment lose his presence of mind. #
j But npt to trust himself too'near his honI
ornble but dangeious enemy, he kept at a
! prudent "distance ; and* elevating his rifle,
which fortunately lie had with him, he 'let
fly-a charge right into the mouth of the "
snake, which passing through his brain and
out at the back of his head, he killed him on
the spot. Then taking a hooked, stick.
when he prepared for the purpose, he fas
