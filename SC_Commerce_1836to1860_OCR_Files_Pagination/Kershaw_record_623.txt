munication is a reply?"Mr. Pemberton has mis.
taken the good sense of the people of South
Carolina. True, for some time they have appeared
destitute of any fixed principles, and ready
to be controlled by any weathercock who assumed
the direction; but the end of that time approaches;
the people are beginning "to think" for
themselves." "Lancaster" rejoiced to hear the
+k?*f if iq trup
remark, ana Deneves, hay iccu, luai it. ao m ?
In the upper region of the State at least, "a still,
small voice is heard, teeming with whispers of a
great, a coming "cliange"?a "change" which
threatens the downfall of the attempted reign of
anarchy and agrarianism.
"So mote it be!" LANCASTER.
POSTSCRIPT.
Mr. Editor: In the reply of "Lancaster" to
the reply of the editor of the Carolinian, the writer
apprehends that from the haste with which it
wa6 prepared (in order to be ready for the mail,)
he committed a "blunder," perhaps as great as
stcme of those with which he charged the editor.
You will oblige him, therefore, by adding these
remarks, by way of explanation. In the concluding
sentence, if he remembers correctly, he
stated, that from indications in the up-country,
at least, he anticipated a change, which threatened
"the downfall of the attempted reign ol
anarchy and agrarianism." To this he should
hive added?"on the one hand, or centralism on
the other." For those results, however opposite
and antagonist in their character, are produced
alike, from the same causes; and in the opinion
of the writer, the tendency in this State, assumes
a good deal of the centralizing aspect?

THE PRINTER?rj
Reader! Gentle reader!! You! the very man
who is now reading this paper. Step this way
we have a word with you. Do you not owe
some little dues to this office? Some slight accounts
of four, five, or ten dollars for subscription,
advertising, cards, hand bills, blanks or other
small matters? Some trifle that you had almost
forgotten, or thought too unimportant tc
trouble yourself withl Try and recollect?and i
you do, now is the very witching time to fork ii
over. -Never could come better. No odds how
small?all will help.
There are the friendly Post-masters, waiting
to send on your remittances?and here are we
ever as ready to make entries on the credit af
on the debt side of the Ledger. Come?do you
know that your character is atstake in this matter!
Dr. Franklin, you know, was a philosophej
as well as a printer. Hear what he 6ays?
"Printers' accounts, though small, are a very
good index of character. Let me look over my
books, and I will tell you the character of every
person whose name is there." And how did lie
tell, pray? Simply by looking on the credit
side. If he saw every thing snugly footed up
and balanced, there could be no mistake?the
man was a gentleman. But if?never mindperhaps
you are only a little negligent?but dc
not risk your character any longer for a mere
trifle.
Gtoitr IN pkospect.?A writer in uie iiew
Orleans Bulletin proposes to take Mexico, in re
venge for the capture of the Santa Fe expedi
lion. He says:
,"There are twenty thousand men in the vallej
of the Mississippi, who would start at the sounc
of the drum, and neither give sleep to their eyes
nor slumber to their eyelids, tijl they knelt t(
the God of Battles in the Temples of the Monte,
zumas. I for one Would willingly lead where
any dares follow; and I call upon General Combe,
of Kentucky, whose son was in the expedition,
and the friends of Kendall, of the Picayune, to
rally around the standard of freedom, and come
to their rescue. Beforeah August sun shall gild
the towers of the ancient city of Annahuac, we
will give 'civil and religious liberty' to a suffering
and oppressed people, and expel every tyrant
from the soil."
Rev. John Newland Maffit.?This distinguished
divine has assumed the duties* of his
station; and, under the commission of the Kins
of Kings, preached twice to Congress. We did
not attend Mr. Maffits, first sermon bul on Sun.

morning, and almost unconsciously found our.
selves in the Representative Hali. We enteret

Maffits matter or manner, but when he openet

forth in strains of matchless eloqnence, th<
burning thoughts of a comprehensive, intellectu
al, and poetical mind; when he contemplated Goc
and man, and showed that the Creator's thoughti
were not our thoughts, nor his ways our way
we were forced to acknowledge that a maste
spirit stood at the alter, and we bowed our op
positionat the shrine of talent. We noticed tha
he turned his voice to suit the hall, and w<
heard, (what we never heard before in that hall,]
the old .pillars repeat the words of the speaker
with a distinctness and a regularity that startlei
us. Maffil has a 6oul full of poetry. He roam:
like the bee through the rosy gardens of thi
wind, and returns laden with the sweets of hi:
toil. Some think his illustrations ancient twici
?told affairs?but we think he who declares tin
word of God should chose rather an appropriati
simile, than a novel one; and that simile whicl
will express his meaning the clearest; no matter
whether he takes it from the life of Wash
ington, or ihe red field of Waterloo, is the best

The Murrain.?This disease has in many
places the present season proved fatal to cattle,
and although we have much more faith in prevention
than in the cure of this disease, still the
following from Mr. Forsyth in Canada, is giver
in the hope that it may prove as effectual as it is
Baid to be: "Give 1 and a half ounces of pearlash

give half an ounce more, in aqnart of water; the
iron water should be warm. Give no drink but

Catholicism in Havana.?A letter from Havana,
published in the New York Sun, says:
Old Spain has sent out orders here to sell a large
portion of the churches, and to reduce the large c
salary of the priests to a small annuity, hardly 1
worth having. I believe they have the privilege ?
of throwing off their eclesiastical robes and go- c
ing into any other business, if they choose.?
This is a terrible blow to the Church, in this
island, as it reduces her power and influence,
alreadv on the wane, to almost nothing. I have j j
I no doubt it will prove the stepping stone to the
I toleration of all religions here.
We have never seen a more startling
sentiment expressed by an American prim j
than what appeared in the "Evangelist," }
an abolition print in New York, in the i
case of the Creole. "It justifies and admires
the mutiny and murder?calls the <
nineteen mutineers "noble mon!"?and :
declares, that their act in throwing them- i
selves upon the authorities of Nassau, "is i
a splendid tribute to the British Govern- i
ment, and is a brighter gem in the diadem
of her sovereign, than the victory of any ,
battle-field. It was confidence in law,
sustained by power, and founded on unquestionable
justice. Take it altogether, '
1 it was morally magnificent. The . liberty
which saluted them on landing, by the triumphant
shouts of thousands that wel
corned litem, must have been a glorious
reward to those men for their brave and
perilous achievement." It lakes sides'
against the South throughout the whole j'
transaction?and calls-upon the F. ma tics
[ to rouse up, ami employ the most kind, 1
wise, urgent and immediate exertions, to
, accomplish iheir cheerful and voluntary e.
mancipation." The New York Journal
of Commerce publishes the whole article
' "as an advertisement," und the Boston
' Courier transfers it to its "columns grutls
because, in ail that touches the conduct
? of the slaves in the Creole, and the proper
character it. gives to their effort to gain
r their liberty, it 6peaks our own sentiments."
"Was there ever grosser fanati>
cism? Does any man believe, that the rd1
itorof the Bost in.Courier, and men like
" him, would not have treated the slaves at
Boston, as the British did at Nassau? And
| how is it possible, that, if these sentiments
, should be publicly proclaimed?and, if
- they are sanctioned by the people, this
! glorious Union, which is knit together
more by lellow feeling' than the Charter
' itself, should withstand the progress of
! such insane fanaticism?
