ANCIENT AND MODERN AQUEDUCTS* ]
The firemen of (lie city of New York
have chosen the 10th of September, the
anniversary of Perry's victory on Lnko j
Erie, to celebrate the achievement of the
Croton aqueduct, the most perfect and J
* efficient structure of the kind of ancient j
or modern limes. Although contrivances i
C
for the conveyance of water from distant J
sources, for the supply of cities, are of I
great antiquity, we have no accounts of j
aqueducts, properly so called, till the time
??!' the Romans. The city of Sainos, says
Herodotus, was supplied with water by
. piercing a hill 300 feet in height, by a
tunnel 4,200 feet long, 8 feet high and
foot nhroad. In Egvpt, in Babylon,
find in Judea, works of considerable ex. I
tent were constructed for the conveyance !
of water. The Romans were celebrated !
for their aqueducts which were not can- j
fined to the capital, but were constructed j
at many of their most important cities in j
Europe, Asia, and Africa, tho remains' o! '
which arc still seen. That of*Segovia, j
r ' in Spain, built in the titno of Trajan, is j
a magnificent work, consisting of double
I? rows of arches, 109 in number, according :
to Mnltc Brun, the largest of which are j
nearly 90 feet in height from the ground |
to the conduit, and wholly consisting of j
enormous stones joined together without :
mortar, by which water has been conveyed
into the town for seventeen hundred
years. The neighborhood of Rome is dis.
tinguished by a long series of these almost j
imperishing memorials of her ancient i
" ^ ?:<i; i
inagnincence. oome ui mem uic.-auu m
use and othars, though in astute ofruin,
are amongthcgreatest ornamentsof Italy.
on *
Some idea may he had of the extent and
importance of these works, from the lact
that the city, containing a population of j
four millions, was supplied with water !
from sources varying from thirty to stxlv
miles in distance, and that at one period
. no less than twenty aqueducts brought as
many streams across the wide plain in
which the city stands. Artificial channels i
winding along the hills and mountains, J
and tunnels through interposing harriers, I
led the water the greater portion of the j
distance ; hut the aqueduct was required
to cross the valleys, and trf conduct the !
stream from the surrounding hills to the ;
walls of the eternal city. In some places
their manner of construction required !
arches of200 feet in height, and one
aqueduct is said to .have consisted of
nearly 7,000 arches, in many places !
more than one hundred feet high. Thpre i
is nothing more interesting,, or more
really beautiful says a writer on this sub.
ject, in the existing ruins of ancient
Roint*, than the remains of these splendid
works, which radiate in almost every
direction, and run across the almost level
plain, out of which its hills anse in long
arcaded series, whose simplicity and long
unbroken continuity produces a degree
of grandeur unmatched bv the more labored
and more pretending works within
the walls. The city is still abundantly
supplied with water by three of these an.
? cient aqueducts, which have undergone
rrpiirsand restorations by tlie direction j
#?f the Popes. The Aqua Virginia and!
Aqua Felice are the principal.
Of the most celebrated aqueducts of
modern times are that of Caserta in Napies,
and of Mainter.on in Prance, begun
by Louis XIV. in 1684, to cany water
from the river Kuro to Versa ties, but
abandoned in 1638. This was designed to
have been the most stupendous aqueduct
in the world ; the whole length contemplated
was 60,000 fathoms; the bridge 2,070
fathom?, consistingof 632 arches 220 feet
high. There is also a modern aqueduct
r,t Bemfica, ne^ir Lisbon, in Portugal.
TheX'roton aqueduct grdatly surpasses
v any of the above strictures,-both in mag.
a,vl nerfcrtion. There is no use.

mo.us stones, hut the whole is a beautiful
monument of the perfection to which the |
art has arrived at this .day?simple,
efficient, and durable. It may not present
so imposing a front to the vulgar,)
hut to the Engineer and the man of sci- I
ence, it has an nircf grandelir and sub '
liroityV arisjng from t!ie \a tnossof its
proportions. The main trunk is 40 miles
in.length, wholly composed of masonry,
0 1-2 feet wide, and 9 feet high. The
. walls are 3 feet thick, cemented into solid '
rock. The grand reservoir at the head ;
of the aqueduct is caused hy a dam of
stone work 49 feet high and 70 broad,
thrown across the Croton river, forming
< an expanse of water 500 acres in extent,
sufficient to supply any emergency, J
The trunk is carried over valleys and j
streams, through hills and harriers of sol- !
id rock, affording opportunities to (he engineer
for the display of skill and taste,
which has heen improved with very happy
effect. For instance, the bridge which
crosses the Sing Sing creek is a single j
elliptical arch of 80 feet span, and 100
foet above the stream. The bridge across
Harlem river is 13J0feet in length, 116
feet above high water, .and <^>st nearly
8869,000. Sleepy Hollow is also span,
ned hy a series of graceful arches, and the
vailev of Glen denning is passed at an

elevation of 40 feet, affording carriage- !
ways and footpaths over its arches. At '

received into the reservoir at Yurkville,
which contains an area of 3y acres, enclosed
hv granite walls, and capable of
receiving 150 millions *?f gallons. The
distributing reservoir at Murray's 11:11 is
also a work of great magnitude and expense,
and calculated to endure as long as
he hills aud rocks. It is in the Egyptian
style of architecture, with a promenade
20 feet in width at the top of the walls,
flagged, and provided with an iron railing.
It employed 400 men four years in Its
construction. Altogether, it is a triumph
of>ki!l and enterprise of which the world

require two or throe years vet, although
temporary pipes ore laid, by which water
was distributed to the city 011 the 4th of
July last. Its advantages to the city in
the extinguishment of fires alone are incalculable.
In the great conflagration of
1835 (he amount of property destroyed
was estimated at seventeen millions of
dollars, one third more than the cost of
this work ; the extent of which was in a
great degree attributable to the want of a
convenient supply of water. The fire department,
appreciating the great impor.
tance of the work on this score, have set
apart a glorious day in our country's annals
for an appropriate celehiation. We
hope no storm cloud may he so overcome
as to shed its tears upon the scene.

The prevalence of defective teeth in
this country is the general subject of re.
mark by foreigners ; and whoever lias
travelled in Spain and Portugal is struck
with the superior soundness and whitenessof
teeth in those countries. Though
not a cleanly people in other respects,
they wash their teeth often, and by j
means of tooth picks, carefully remove 1
all substances from between them, after !
meals. A little silver porcupine, with !
holes all over its back, to insert toothpicks,
is a common ornament on the
- " i r* . I 'PL_
dining.tables 01 Spain anil roriugni. * hc |
general use of them creates so large a
demand, tint students at Coimbra some- j
limes support themselves by whittling ,
toothpicks, which are sold, tied in small
hunches, l:k?* matches, i liey are made
of willow, on account of its toughness |
and pliability, Toolh-picks of metal are '
too hard, and are apt to injure the gums, j
There is the same objection, in a less de- ,
groG, to quills, ilut willow tooth-picks
are preferable to nil ,others; and they
have the advantage of being the ipost
cleanly ; for they usually break in the
using, and arc thrown away. Few sights
arc more offensive oa person of any refinement,
than a tooth-pick that has been
much used ; it is moreover unclea?.lvt and
therefore not healthy for the teeth. Food
allowed to remain between the teeth,
particularly animal food, is very do?tww>-4
tivc ; it should he carefully removed after
everv oiea', and the mouth thoroughly
rinsed. This may seem to many like a
great talk about a small matter; but these
arc simple precautions to t ike, and very
alignt trouble, compared with the agony
of aching teeth, a breath so offensive
that your best Iriend does not wish to sit
near you. I can see no reason why a
man's complexion should cxeluuo bun
from the dining-tabie, hut I do see a very
gitod reason why he should be banished
for not taking proper care of his teeth.
A-had breath is such a detestable thing,
that it mfeht be sufficient reason for not
D #
marrying a person wih other .vise agreca- ,
b!e qualities. It is mo cover, perfectly
inexcusable thus to transform oneself into
a walking fie ulchre. Nobody needs to
to have an offensive breath, A careful
removal of substances from between the
teeth, rinsing the mouth after meals, and
a bit of charcoal held in the mouth, will
always cure a had breath. Charcoal
used as a dentifrice, (that is, rubbed on in
powder, with a brush) isapt to injure the
enamel; hut a lump cd it held in the
mouth, two or throe times a week, and
slowly chewed, has a wonderful power to
preserve tlie teeth, and purify the breath.
The action is purely chemical. It conn,
teracts the ac.id arising from a disordered
stomach, or food decaying about the;
gums; and it is this acid which destroys
the teeth. A dear friend of ours had,,
when about twenty years of age, a front <
tooth that turned black gradually, crumbled,
and broke off piecemeal. By frequently
chewing charcoal, the progress of
decay was not only arrested, but nature
set vigorously to work to restore the breach,
and the crumbled portion grew again,
till.the whole tooth was as sound us be- j
fore ! This I know to he a fact.
Every one knows "that charcoal is an j
antipulrcKcent, and is used in boxing up ;
animal and vegetable substances, to keep j
them from decay. Upon the same chemical
principle, it tends to prese rve the
teeth, and sweeten the breath.
There is no danger in swallowing it ;
on the contrary; small quantities have a
healthful effect on the inward system,
particularly when the body is suffering
from that class of complaints peculiarlyincident
to summer. It -would not be
w i??e to swallow that, or any gritty sub.
stance, in large quantities, or very frequently
; but once or twice a week, a
Utile would-be saliHury rather than otherwise.
A hit of charcoal, as big as a
cherrv, nieielv held in the mouth a few
hours, without chew ing, has^a good effect.
At lir^t, most people dislike to chew it,
but use soon renders it far from disagree- I
uMe. I hose who are troubled with un
offensive breath, might chew it^very of.
. ten. and swallow it but seldom. **It is peculiarly
impoiTW to clean and rirSe the

otherwise a great deal of the destructive
ncid will form in the, night
If these hints iijduco only one person to
take better care of the teeth, 1 shall he
more than regarded for the trouble of
writing. I am continually pained to see
young peoole losing their teeth merely
for want of a few simple precautions ; and
one cannot enter stage or steam car without
finding the atmosphere polluted, and
rendered absolutely unhealthy for the
lungs to breathe, when a proper use of
water and charcoal might render it as
wholesome and pleasant as a hrecze ol ;

KNOWLEDGE.
Bent lev's Misr? llanv, for September,
contains among other things tiie followin?:
.. . !
Anecdotal reminiscence ofan English
missionary named Clnike, who went out
to convert the PHtives of India !o Christianity,
hut. failing in his efforts returned
in despair to Calcutta. We give the rest
of the anecdote in the writer's <?wn words :
One day our missionary learned, to his
great joy, that a Brahmin of the very first
rank had arrived in the metropolis. Determined
to bring matters to an issue,
Clarke wrote to him, and begged him to
meet iiiin on a certain day, when he undertook
to convince him (the Hindoo
priest) cf the errors of his faith. To this
the Brahmin consented, and at the time
appointed the Heathen and ttie Christian,
champion met to discuss, in the presence
_r .1 inpri's of their
til ?>uvtl?u n uiiuoow, Miv ...v. - respective
creeds.
As is usual in polemical . discussions,
the controversy was opened by several
inconsequential queries and answers.
For half an hour neither party had put
forth n startling proposition; the wily Indian
taking c?-e to confine himself to the
defensive, 'fired at length by this scene,
Clarke suddenly and abruptly asked him :
4 Are you forbidden to eat .anything in
which animal life exists V?41 am.
4 Have vou ever broken through this
law V?4 Never.'
4 May you not unconsciously have been
led into this crime?'?4 Impossible.'
Will you ?toe<tr to it?:?4 .Most solemnly
I do.'
Do you ever eat pomegranates V?
4 Daily.'
4 Bring me some of that fruit, then, rejoined
Clarke, turning to a servant. His
order was complied with ; the potnrgrunates
were brought.
4 Chose on?.' The Brahmin did so,
4 Cut it in two.' With this direction he
complied. 4 Place it here,' and Clark assisted
him to put it beneath a microscope.
4 Now look at it.*
The B.nhmin did so ; but no sooner did
he apply his eye, than he started back
with affright. The fruit was perfectly
alive with AMHNihMrift.' t ho puzzled
Hindoo drew out the pomegranate, [w hich,
perhaps, my readers are not aware, k
more closely filled with insects than any
other fruit,] looked at it, examined it, re
1 ;* ..,..1 ixrmn the iiiVi iads of
lit uimi ?v
living creatines w ith which it was rife.
Ho fe!t it with his hand, to convince himself
that there was no trick in the affair.
Then suddenly diawing himself tip, he
slowly uttered,4 Bus suck hi. ['Enough
?it is true ]
4 Yon acknowledge, then, that you
have sinned unconsciously ? f haf ?;v? rv
thing being filled with animnlcu'se. invisi.
hie to the naked eye, vou can neither eat
nor drink without committing a crime.'
The abashed Hindoo (towed.
4* Shali I show you how full of similar
insects every drop of water is?'?4 No! I
have seen enough.'
4 Do vou desire further proof !'?I have
a favour to ask.'
4 What is it ? If I cm, I will grant it.'
4 Give me your miscroscope. 1 cannot
buy it ; give it to inc.'
Clarke paused for a moment, for he had
that morning paid ten guineas for it ; and,
being a poor man, he could ill afford to
part with it. Hut. as the Indian was urgent,
almost to entreaty, he at length eon.
Kented [especially as he thought the other
would a fiord him in return some curiosity
of equal value,] and presented it to him.
* The Brahmin took it, gave one look of
triumph round the hall, and suddenly
raising his arm, dashed it into a thousand
atoms on the marble floor.
* Whni rh? vnu mean hv this?' exclaim
a" ?
ed Clarke, in undisgtiished astonishment.
4 It means, Sir Christian.' replied the
Hindoo in a roiJ. grave tono, 4 or means
that I was a happy, a good, a proud man.
By means of yonder instrument you have
robbed mo of all future happiness. You
li.'.vc condemned me to descend to my
Eravo wretched and miserable !'
With these words Iho unfortunate Brah.
min quitted the hall and soon after retired
up the country.

The Southern Planter (Richmond) says
on the authority of an old turfman ihat
vinegar and chalk made an excellent remedy
for the grubs in horses. A pint of
moderately strong vinegar is poured on a
cubic inch of chalk, and when the etfer.
vescenee ceases, the horse is drenched
with the mixture.
The American Mechanic says that iron
may be sawed while red hot, and that for
many purposes it is preferable to saw, in
place of the present custom of splitting
with a cold chisel. The saw employed is
made thicker at the cutting edge than at
the back, and with teeth 12 to the inch.
The iron is heated red hot and screwed
into a vice, and the saw frequently dipped
iii water during the operation to prevent
its heating too much.
The same authority states that the hardest
kind of steel may be cut cold by a thin
circularjDiece of iron fastened to a turning

Agriculture is the foundation of all human
arts?the art for which man was inade, and,
the perfection of which is his chief happiness
and glury as the lord temporal of tins planet*
Of this sublime art, all other arts and sciences
are but satellites, their business being to wait
cn, enlighten, and adorn it with their moonshine.
Consequently no man more than the
agriculturist needs the full use of his brains,
and a perfect command of all the treasures of
human experience. So the farmers of the
United States view the matter; and in presenting
them with a translation of the celc.
brated Maison Rustique, of the French, we
have no doubt oftheir hearty support. It ic
the work of all works on pradical agriculture
?the most scientific, clear, and crmprehensive,
France has long excelled in profitable
farming. This is the source of her wealth.
England is rich by coals and commerce. Her
agriculture is splendid, but sometimes costs
more than it comes to. Those who have
fortunes to spend may buy the vast works of
Marshall, Dickson Arthur Young, Loudon,
&c., but those who wish to pet a fortune out
of iho soil will fmd the French writers better
able to show them the way. The excellence
of French elementary works is well known to
all teachers. For centuries, the Maison
Ru.-tique has been, in Franco, the standard
elementary work?the spelling book and
grammar of tarming. The present edition for
" the nineteenth century," has he m re-written
and brougJil up with the " march of mind,"'
by sixty of tho ablest "agronemes" of France.

William Cobber, one of the most successful
farmers both in England ai d America, who
wrote the best stylo and the best French
grammer that ever was, valued the Mai son
Rustiqnes, not only as an encyclopedia of
farming, but us a means of educating his
children. He was his own schoolmaster. In
winter evenings his family resolved itself into
a school, and ho thus speaks of the use then
made o| this work:?
