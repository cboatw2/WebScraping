^ whose veracity we think we may depend, J
that another most cowardly attack has
been committed on the Disputed Territo- < ^
rv? upon three American gentlemen by ; '
some fellows calling themselves* mounted !
patroles. It seems that the gentlemen j1
above named viz: Thomas F. Templeton,, j
George Cady and John II. lie iw ick, were ; |
proceeding lroin Fa gor to Canada and, : i
on their arrival near Madawasca,* a party ;
of armed British soldiers met most direct . ,
road to take, lie gave him the necessj.ry ! information,
when four others came up i
and asked Mr. Cady some impertinent <
questions as to the object of his journey ; s
Mr. C. replied very properly and procee- i
d< d to turn the horses into the load, when <
one of the squad stepped in front of the j:
carriage and asked what the reelings ot j1
thcpcopb were in relation to the hunting 1
of the Caroline. Air. 'i\ inj.It-ton said i
they were vjry nut. rally in? ig a:i' at si.e . [

of the country?"If MeLeod hurnt thai t

cs our thanks and if a hair of his head \
is injured you, mid \ our damned countn - t
lain will b; made lo rejaoU in dust an 1 t

rjply to this insolent remark than to re- '
<juest the leaders to allow them a tree and :|
unmolested passage. J?ut lour or live ot 'J

The following account of the appearance
of the remains ot Napoleon, when exhumed
js taken t'roin a letter to the editor of the N.
V. Journal of Commerce, dalcu, St. Helena
. Nov. 2d, 1S49.
When the coffin had been t'ms removed,
the Commissioners stepped into tli chamber,
in which had rested this coffin for upward* of
19 1,-7 years, whicli chamber was as perfect
.and as dry as it was on the I) h Vlay, 18J1
Tjic outside coffin (mahogany] was *ep rated
asunder, next to which was one of lead in tlr
i.?.-i_?. r,.n^urt'^rinn Ari*!inir(>im<ntk

Tiavingbeen previou-ly directed by 11in Ex
cellency, in consequence of his iudispos tinn,?
.ibis leaden coffin was hoisted up a d placed
within the sarcophagus sent from France for
that purpose. Tins sarcophagus scut from
.France for that purpose. This done,- the
Governor with his Staff made their appearance,
to w itness the opening of the
j innermost coffin. The upper surface of
the leaden coffin was then carefully removed,
when another mahogany one was
discovered in a most excellent state. The
lid of the inner one, immediately next tile
remains of Napoleon, made of sheet tin,supcrficiully
corroded, was next lifted. Then
. appeared a white satin enveloping the
body, which satin was by the surgeon
himself removed, and the mortal remains
of the Great Deceased were exposed to
view, to several who knew him not. The
features of the Corsican Lieutenant had
to aH appearance suffered but very little.
( for they were readily recognized. General
Gonrgaud on beholding them exclaimed
"Good ! very good! !" And the
several crticles, pictures. &c., &c., which
had been placed around him within thecoflin,
appeared as thev were on the day
of interment. Napoleon's hands
were in the same position and
place in which his faithful Bertrand had
j nearly twenty years before placed them,
n and looked in a higlt state oi preservation.
11 Is order, his uniform, his coeked hal.
which has ever been identified with his
person, were but very little injured by the
hand of time, and the whole wore the air
I of very recent deposit; hut part of the
| satin appeared to have insinuated itself
r j?into the skin of the face. Two minutes
j only elapsed lor this exposure, which was
I j chiefly to a (Ford the .Surgeon time to use
j certain preventives to further decomposii
tion. The tin coflin was then closed and
i soldered, the mahogany one secured, and
the leaden one soldered. The other leadon
one with and belonging to thesarcophaeus
sent froin France, was likewise sol!
der'd and sealed, when the sarcophagus
| was locked, and the key was then liandI
cd to Comte de Chabot, the French Comj
nhssioner, by Captain Alexander, the
| Knglish Commissioner. This sarcopha!
gus after some formalities of expression
between the Commissioners, was then
placed on the hearse and covered with the
pall (a very rich one made of crimson velvet)
and between and 4 'oclock the pro
cession moved from Hie loino.

the s.x winter months, Ijcsides her hay, j
and if her summer feed be such as it
