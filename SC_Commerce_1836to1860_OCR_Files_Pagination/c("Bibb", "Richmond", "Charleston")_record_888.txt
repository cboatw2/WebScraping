Rev. Brother McFerrin,—I wrote my laBt com
munication for your paper from Fort Coffee, early
in October, and supposed that I should have
written to you again long ere this time, but have
been prevented by almost incessant travelling.
Immediately after conference I commenced anoth
er southern tour, and visited the CreekB, Chica
saws, and Choctaws. Then passing again through
the Cherokee country, I made my way home by
the military road leading from Fort Gibson, on the
Arkansas, to Fort Leavenworth, on the Missouri.
This is a road passing through the Indian country
qear the state line, and is kept in repair by the Uni
ted States Government. It is an excellent road
for carriages, and extends south to Forts VVashi
taw and Towson, on Red River; but the southern
portions of it are more rough. The entire length
of this road through the Indian territory is about
500 miles. It passes through or near the lands of
mogy of the border tribes, and furnishes great fa
cilities to the missionaries, as well as the troops, in
carrying on their work.
Having now visited every portion of our confer
ence, I return home better satisfied of the utility of
our organization than I ever was. I had been em
ployed in that part of it that formerly belonged to
Missouri conference ; and from my experience and
observations, I had become convinced that we ought
to be more independent of other conferences: but
when I went' down south, and saw the state of
thiugs in that part of the work which was connect
ed with the Arkansas conference, 1 was forced to
believe thal a new arrangement was mdispensible.
I thank the General Conierence that it gave us a
■eparale existence. And what I leel most con
cerned about now is that we way show ourselves
worthy of the confidence reposed in us. For if we
do this, I am confident that God and his church will
do their part. Yes, brother McFerrin, we believe
out here that the “old ship” will yet right hersell
under the wise command of our great Captain.
But 1 am one who thinks she would do it sooner,
x and with less damage, if the crew were a little
more self-possessed, and more obedient to orders.
It is admirable, however, to see how every one ap
plies himself with a degree of enthusiasm that looks
like he thought the salvation of the ship depended
on himself. But it must be evident we are making
no headway. We would do better now to stand
still, get composed, and wait for orders from above
And, thank Heaven, our Captain is not asleep.
And if he were, it would be safest for us, in our
perilous condition to go to him as his disciples did
on the sea, saying, “Master, Master, we perish
and then he would rebuke the winds, and we
shoi^d have a calm. O that our wise men, north
and south, could see this thing in its proper light!
Then they would cease to fight the waves of this
foaming ocean, and commit the whole to Him who
is able to say, “Be still,” and they should obey
him. Why, dear brethren, we don’t intend, God
being our helper, to let the Methodist Episcopal
Church in the south be rundown and trampled un
der foot by any who would do it. The General
Conference intended this should not be done, and
made provision against it. And let us go along
quietly about our work, and when we come togeth
er next spring, (if God bo allow,) those who will
compose the Convention, guided by the spirit of
their Master, will be prepared to adopt such meas
ures as the stale of the Church demands. But do
pardon so humble an indvidual for this freedom.
1 could not help giving a little vent to the pent up
feelings of an almost bleeding heart. I did not in
tend a word upon this when 1 began to write.
The-territory embraced within our conference
contains about 80,000 Indians, not counting the
Pawnees, theComquchies, and other numerous wild
tribes. About 120,000, or one fourth of these, ought
to be in school; whereas I suppose that there are
not more than 1000 of them under a course of edu
cation. We have about twenty-seven missiona
ries, including seven natives, employed to
preach to these thousands, and some of these
are teaching school. The Presbyterians have
about ten, and the Baptists about the same num
ber of ministers in this territory. But it must be
recollected that these people differ in these circum
stances very materially Iroiri their white neigh
bors. There you have one language ; here we
have not less than twenty. There you live inclose
contact; here the people are much dispersed—so
much so, that in some instances a missionary’s la
bors are unavoidably confined to 100 inaividals, or
less. We ought to have twenty more missionaries
at this time employed in this work. There are
large inviting fields not occupied at ail, or but very
partially cultivated. In many places, the Indians
■ want preaching where we are not able to supply
them ; and there are several openings now for large
schools to be established, which would be chiefly
supported by the people themselves, if we had suit
able men for the work. And I feel fully authori
sed to say that many of these tribes are expecting
the Methodists to sympathise with them, and to
extend to them ajiberal helping hand in this time
of need. And now is the time to do it. A few
‘more years of delay, and it maybe too late. 1
view these Indians upon the very verge of a yawn
ing precipice. A little suspense on the part of
those from whom their help must come, and they
are beyond the help of recovery.—Brethren, minis
ters, and members of the M. K. Church, will you
longer delay the discharge of your duties to these
poorl Remember, “Inasmuch as ye did unto
one of these little ones ye did it unto me.”
At our next conference, we want to station forty
missionaries at least; and for their support and the
support of our schools, which we expect to be
greatly augmented by that time, we shall want not
less than thirty thousand dollars. And besides this,
our drafts for the current year (much less than
they ought to have been) are to be met. The as
sistant treasurer has kindly ventured to honor the
drafts for the first quarter; but we have no assur
\ AIs'
ance for the other three. Brethren! *end up your
liberal contributions to the treasury, and let it be
seen what you think of these missions, and what
you intend to do. And if any of you think that our
interest on this subject arises from selfish motives,
we invite such to come and take our place, and we
will take yours, and do the best we can for you
and the missions. Will you try us on this point 1
We challenge you to it. Perhaps we might not
preach to white folks as well as you ; but we will
promise to be as fervent and eloquent as it is pos
sible for us to be in begging and praying for you :
and this is what we ask of you while you see fit to
keep us here. With sincere desires for the pros
perity of the whole Church, I am your fellow
labourer in the Lord’s vineyard,

SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN ADVOCATE.
FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 1845.

THE GREAT CONFLICT.
The intense and restless activities of the age
we live in have turned the public mipd strongly
in the direction of religion, as well as politics
and commerce. The importance of this element
in human affairs, is well-nigh universally ac
knowledged ; and the conflict of opinion respect
ing its true character and claims waxes greater
among mere intellectualists and men of the
world. The literature of the time partakes
largely of the increasing excitement, and octa
vos, duodecimos, and pamphlets innumerable,
besides regular weeklies, monthlies, quarterlies,
take sides and lend a helping hand according as
their respective partialities, interests, or position
may seem to require. If we look at the leading
churches in Christendom, we shall perceive the
stir of intense excitement—renewed activity—or
earnest conflict. It is admitted, on all hands,
that Rome reaches once more after universal
spiritual dominion. In this she is but true to
her first principles. If there is no salvatipn out
of her pale, why blame her for moving heaven
and earth to extend her sway 1 She claims to
be the only chartered corporation, authorized to
mediate, by her priesthood, between God and
the individual, and mus anecis 10 comer upon
the individual all necessary spiritual privileges
here, and everlasting salvation hereafter. True
to the theory of these lofty pretensions, she is
setting in motion her vast machinery, and arm
ing her legions for the last great conflict of
principles—between sense on the one hand, and
faith on the other.
That this conflict may be still more unequal, as
to the mere combatants, so that the glory of the
ultimate triumph may but the more signally be
long to God and his truth, behold the condition
of the Protestant churches. There is the church
of England, in a state of dissension unparalleled.
Tractarianism has worked its way so extensive
ly, and of late has become so undisguised in its
tendencies, as to excite unmingled alarm among
the clergy who remain sound, and the great
body of the laity. Attempts are making to en
force a subscription to the thirty-nine Articles
in their plain common-sense acceptation; these
are resisted by those who wish to eat the bread
and share the emoluments and honours of
the Church, while at heart they axe Pa-j
pists. A convocation of the Bishops is talked
of one day, and abandoned the next. The arch
bishop of Canterbury has been called upon to
interpose and put an end to the unsightly disa
greements which shal% the Establishment to its
foundations. The Bishop of Exeter has brought
about a*scene of universal uproar and dissension
in that part of the kingdom, by insisting upon
changes in the dress of the officiating minister,
which the people will not submit to. The sin
cere friends of the establishment look at each
other in alarm, and ask what will the end be?
Meanwhile an organized and formidable move
ment is in progress, aiming at the total abolish
ment of the State Church, and the- establishment
of the voluntary principle in its place.
In Scotland, ever and again a vigorous sally
is made upon the Free Church, by the adher
ents of the old Establishment. Erastianism has
some energies to expend upon its new antagon
ist, however torpid and good-natured it may be
in reference to the world and the devil. The
division of the Scottish Church, is a recent
• ..
cvcm ui ui^ii sj^uuiLaiJtCj ucicu uui uu a wunu- |
eyed stage, and sending abroad a strong influ
ence, which will exhibit its results hereafter.
And then, if we look at our own country, we
shall perceive, in various directions, the heaving
of strong excitements, the indications of some
great approaching movement. The Protestant
Episcopal Church, whose boast of unity has
been long and loud, is torn by factions, which
can conceal their disagreements no longer, and
has been humbled before the face of the whole
land in the degradation of two of her Bishops,
who Tuled the most important of her dioceses.
The former Presbyterian .Church has been rent
in twain by doctrinal disagreements: each sec
tion will soon be subjected to the same ordeal
through which the Methodist E. Church has
been called to pass. Upon the Southern por
tion of the latter Church has been forced the ne
cessity of separation from their Northern bre
thren. Fanaticism has broken, rivet and link,
the firmest bonds which ever held an e^lesias
tical connection together. The same malign
element will, in all likelihood, break in pieces
any Northern confederacy of churches. Un
checked, it will sweep with the besom of de*
at ruction over the fairest prpspects of our conn*
try, turning to desolation-all it touches, while it
professes to be altogether zealous for God and
the rights of man.
With vastly more of exultation than alarm,
do we look upon the portents of the time, the
commotions which heave the bosom of Christen
dom at the present day. Every thing around
us, the events of the last few years, the redoubled
energies and activities of the age, the restless
ness of the public mind, the revival of old su
perstitions, the swarm of new heresies, all in
dicate, with no uncertain prophecy, the ap
proach of the last great conflict' of truth and
error ; the coming on of a dark hour of tumult
and strife, in which all that is substantial in
Christianity shall be tested, and all that is vital
in spiritual religion be subjected to the crucible.
Let those tremble for the result, whose religion
is only a matter of opinion; whose zeal is a
malign fanaticism; who Tush after the trickery
of every new scheme, however frivolous j or
cling, like its very shadow, to whatever is an
cient, or venerable, or associated with the pomp
of pageantry, or the pride of power, in an out
ward formalism. For ourselves, we fear not
the issue. Our confidence reposes on the eter
nal truth of those principles of belief, experience
and practice, taught in the New Testament.
We look, without gloomy foreboding, upon the
march of intelligence, the progress of know
ledge, the activities of free inquiry, the hearings
of society. We hold fast, with the most fixed
belief of its efficiency, to the gospel as we find
it in the testimony of the evangelists and apos
tles, relying, with a steady faith, upon its adap
tation to the actual wants and woes of man, its
capability to achieve, unaided, human happi
ness, its lofty and solemn destiny to convert the
world. What, if in the coming conflict, much
that is cumbrous, unwieldy, heterogeneous, in
existing church organizations, is shaken,
loosened, overthrown. What, if time-honour
ed forms of ecclesiastical regimen are changed.
Let platform and machinery go, if need be.
Still, after all, thetrue spiritual church of Christ
will be found to exist. Unaffected by the rise
and fall of earthly governments, since it is I
amalgamated with none ; living and acting in a I
sphere far removed from the diversities of human
legislation ; pursuing its grand, and sole legiti
mate end—the spiritual and eternal welfare of
mankind; holding its mighty grasp upon human
thought and feeling by the enforcement of the
spiritual and unseen realities of the eternal
world, it shall, successfully, combat the hostility
and unbelief of the world, by the omnipotence of
its truth and love. The present crisis demands a
solemn examination of one’s foundation. It
calls for singleness of purpose and sincere de
votion to Christ. It requires a steady and deep
ening faith, founded solely on God’s word,
cleaving bravely to Christ’s cross. O for light
and love to clothe and actuate the ministry,—a
knowledge, “ rich and varied, digested and com
bined, and pervaded through and through by the
light of the Spirit of God:”—a membership
holding fast the great essentials of a spiritual
Christianity, and actively engaged in spreading,
by whatever means, the knowledge of the truth,
and the experience of the grace of that gospel,
which is “ the power of God unto salvation to
every one thatbelieveth."
BIBLE DESTITUTION IN GEORGIA.
We were much interested in a speech made
before the Georgia Conference at its late session
by Dr. Pierce, the able and laborious Agent of
the American Bible Society for the State of
Georgia. From an extensive and thorough
personal examination, he stated that he had
reached the conviction that an alarming amount
of destitution in regard to the Holy Scriptures,
was to be found in the State of Georgia: that
covered as the country was with church organi
zations, still, away from the beaten tracks of
ecclesiastical operations, in settlements remote
from meeting-houses, in frontier and sparsely
inhabited counties, one half of the population
had no bibles. And even in the best portions of
Georgia, where churches and schools were in
vigorous and energetic play, even there, a fourth
of all the families have never had a bible or
testament I He stated that a gentleman of his
acquaintance, a religious man, bad said that if he
were given to betting he would be willing to bet
his whole foTtune that fifty destitute families
could not be found in the whole of the county
where he lived; when upon a careful inquiry
afterwards, it turned out that 130 out of 300fami
lies in that very county had no bibles. And
yet religious men were wont to beat off a bible
agent by maintaining that there was no necessity
for effort or giving, since no destitution was sup
posed to exist. In fact, in this, as well as other
things, the defect of religious public opinion is to
assume too much. A fearful amount of destitu
tion did exist, whether it was believed or not.
Such a state of things called loudly for a remedy.
The doctor stated that he had in various places
given it as his opinion that our excellent local
preachers might find this peculiar field of godly
enterprise well worth their serious attention.
He had recommended it to his local friends in
stead of keeping up a Sunday appointment or two
in settlements where the people were well furnish
ed with the means of grace, that they should break
ground where no preaching had been known:—
go into out-of-the-way places:—get acquainted
with a family here and there; open a Sunday
school, distribute bibles, form a nucleus for
preaching, and.thus lay the foundation for a new
society. He did not hesitate to declare that such
a procedure would be more promising of success,
according to his mode of calculating moral
chances, than years of labour laid out according;
to the present system. We were forcibly im
pressed with the view thus presented; and
would earnestly recommend the policy to the
consideration of the local ministry generally.
On a visit a month or two ago to Abbeville
district, we found that just such a movement on
the part of one or two of our zealous local breth
ren had led to the formation of a large and
thriving religious society in a neighborhood en
tirely destitute before of the means of grace, and
the erection of a commodious house of worship.
But by all means let us inquire into and supply
to the utmost, the destitution of the word of God.
MORE SNOW.
The prospect of having slaveholding mem
bers in the immaculate Northern M. E. Church,
is getting New-England into a general bother.
A few of the knowing ones wish to conciliate
Baltimore and Kentucky; the sturdy abolition
ism of the mass struggles to make itself heard.
It will speak loud enough by and bye. For
the sake of their “ long distracted Churches,”
their official paper obtests the belligerants to
keep quiet. The “ conservatives” are obliged to
defer so*far to the general voice as to give fair
warning to all in the South who are'for abiding
with them—“ that see mean not to cease our
efforts till the Church be thoroughly expur
gated." “And are we to have such men” (slave,
holders on the Eastern shore of Maryland)!
“remain among us after all? Are these the
loved ones Dr. Bond is trying to retain in the
Church, and that he would guard against a rule
of discipline % My soul sickens at the thought.”
“ We hope the time is not distant when they shall
learn there is no peace for slavery in the Church
now, and no prospect of there being any in the
future.” That future is a dark and dreary one
for the peace of the Northern Methodist connec
tion. There will be no peace while a solitary
slaveholding member is found in the commu
nion. We wish our Baltimore brethren who
go with the North despite all the warnings they
have received from the East, stout hearts and
strong arms: they will have fighting enough
to do.
CHURCH MEETING AT EUFAULA, ALA
A meeting of the members of the M. E. Church
was held at Eufaula, Ala., 2nd Dec., 1844, in re
ference to-the division of the Church, the Rev.
Walter Branham of the Georgia conference open
ing the meeting with prayer, Dr. A. P. Crawford
being in the chair, and E. B. Young secretary*
A long, but very ably written report, which had
been drawn up by order of the quarterly confer
ence, was presented, and the resolutions adopted
with but one dissenting voice. They consider
division inevitable ; approve the action of the.
Southern delegations at the late General confer
ence ; tender thanks to bishops Andrew and
Soule ; recommend to the Alabama conference
the appointment of delegates to the Louisville
convention ; and, among others, we find the fol
ing resolutions, which we copy at length :
‘‘ That this meeting was much surprised to see
in the Christian Advocate and Journal of the 6th
November an expression of the opinion of the se
nior editor, that the South is not unanimous upon
the question of division, he giving as a reason for
that opinion, an extract of a letter written from a
circuit in Alabama, containing 500 members, 300
of whom, the writer of that letter says, are oppos
ed to division.
That it is the opinion of this meeting that if the
letter referred to in the foregoing resolution be
not a hoax upon the worthy doctor, that the writer
had but limited means of acquiring information, or
not sufficient intelligence to understand his breth
ren, and, that we may the belter judge of that,
that the doctor be requested to furnish the next
Alabama conference with a copy of that letter.
That we, in all Christian kindness, say to our
brother Booth of Tennessee, that he had better
tarry at Jericho until his beard grows.
That Bishop Andrew’s cause is our cause, and
with him we stand or fall.”
IMPORTANCE OP PREACHING.
Dr. Anderson, one of the secretaries of the
American Board of commissioners for - Foreign
Missions, returned last summer from a visit made
by order of the Board, to the missions under their
control in the Levant, including Athens, Constan
tinople, the several stations in Asia Minor and Sy
ria. The prospects of the missions, especially
that to the Greeks, is discouraging. The follow
ing testimony of Dr. Anderson as to the impor
tance of preaching is worthy of attention. He
says, “ I never so much felt the incomparable
importance and value of the direct and formal
fbeaching of the oosfel, as during my resi
dence among these missions. No other means,
comparatively speaking, seem to have spiritual
power, except in connection with this; and all
others should be kept in strict subordination to it
I state it as the result of my observations and re
flections for many years past, compared with
what I have seen and heard while in the Levant,
that the department of labour to be fostered and
guarded with the most jealous care in missions, is
the FUBL1C,FORMAL, STATED, FREQUENT PREACH
ING OF THE GOSPEL at every station. Ev
ery missionary, who has the language and health
for the purpose, should prepare himself with stu
dy and prayer, and preach at least every Sabbath
day, if he can get any body to hear him ; and, if,
after proper exertions, he cannot get any body to
hear him, he ought to go where he can. To this
end, the learning of the language, soon after en
tering the country, should be regarded as an im
perative duty, and day and night, and every where
it should be the business of the new missionary,
until he can communicate his ideas in the native
language correctly and freely. And if a mission
ary finds that he cannot learn the language so as
to preach in it, I doubt, in general, the expediency
of his continuing his mission. In most cases, he
had better return home, undesirable as such re
turns are in themselves when they involve a relin
quishment of the.worlf. The shortest method 6f
learning llie real vigor and true value of a mission
as an instrument for planting the gospel in the
hearts of benighted men, is to look at the pulpit,
at the preaching power and habits of the mission
aries.—-And the missionary should consider that
the more he preaches, provided it be with study
and prayer, the better will it be for his spirit, the
better for his skill in the language, the sooner will
he bo a workman that needeth not to-be ashamed.
In short, a revival, successful preacher ; and the
sooner will he be surrounded by joyful converts,
and with churches blooming in spritual grace and
beauty.” ».

Good Southern Doctrine.—After many a vi
bration hither and thither, and all sorts of chop
ping and changing, the Western Christian Advo
cate comes back to the original ground it took
immediately Upon the adjournment of the late
General Conference. If it will only stick there
despite the humbug and stuff which is afloat
above and below Cincinnati, we shall once more
know where to find it—and have some respect
for it when found. Its doctrine on the 17th of
January, was the following:—
“By some, the present period in the history of the
M. E. Church, is considered highly critical in its
character. Critical, to a certain extent, it may
be; but if her members stand true to original prin
ciples, she shall remain unhurt. That branch of
the great Wesleyan Church, to which we belong,
may be formed into two minor^iranches, and still
unimpaired vigor may be retained by both. Al
ready has the main body been divided and sub
divided, and who will deny that each division and
subdivision has resulted in good 7 Far be it from
us to advocate division for the sake of division;
but if division must come, again we say, let it
come in pe^ce. Those brethren who disagree
w-ilb us, declare their firm—their wavering attach
ment to the Discipline as it is, both in letter and
in spirit; and so long as they carry out this noble
declaration, we shall offer them the warm right
hand of Christian fellowship, and freely co-operate
with them in the* work of the Lord. O, that all
minds were filled with heavenly truth, and all
hearts inspired with heavenly love!”
The Coloured Population in Maryland.—
By a late enactment, any one who remains out of
the State 30 days, is prohibited ever to return ;
and more recently a bill has passed the House of
Delegates, subjecting every free coloured man
between the ages of 21 and 50 to an annual tax oi
$1, and if they neglect, between April and June,
to have their names'registered and pay the tax,
they are subject to a penalty of from 5 to 10 dol
lars, and to be hired out for the payment thereof.
A law has also recently been passed, prohibiting a
boat from being sailed under the sole command
of colored men.

TO THE REV. T. MEREDITH, EDITOR, dtc.
Rm Sir:—In your paper of the 13th ult., you
■eems to you to be_ a capital defect in tbe rule
which 1 have ;laid down in my pamphlet to deter
mine the meaning of tbe original language in
the 8th chapter of Acts, relative to the baptism of
the eunuch. And you think it strange that I
should be such a “ dunce” as to give into »uch a
rule. But let us examine'the rule a little mom
closely, and see if it is nothing more tban the
crude conception of a “dunce.” The rule ia
found on the 96th page of my pamphlet, and reads
thus:—
“It is a correct general rule among Greek
writers, that when they intend to express motion
into a place, they double the preposition eis, using
it before the verb of motion, and also before the
word denoting the place into which the motion ie
performed. Eis is universally used before the
noun, and the same preposition, or one of similar
import before the verb of motion.”
Now, sir, I have not laid this rule down as a uni
versal proposition, as you by your partial quota
tion have represented me as doing. I iay that it
,s a correct general rule, and that ia the New
Testament it is a prevailing rule. In the writings
of St. Luke especially, who wrote the Acts of tho
Apostles, and who gave us the account of the
eunuch’s baptism, it is almost universally observed
as the following (flotations show :_ *
Acts xvi. 40,—eisellhon,—they went,—eis,—into,
the house of Lydia.
Actsiii. 8,—eiselthc,—he entered with them, eis,
into, the temple.
Acts v. 511,—eiselthon,—they entered,—eis,_into
the temple early in the morning. *
Acts ix. 6,—Arise and eisohhe,—go,-.eis,—into
the city.
Acts ix. 17,—-And Ananias went bis way and
etseltheu,—entered,—eis,—into, his house.
Acts, xi. 12,—and eiseJthomeu,—we entered,—
eis,—into, the house. *
Luke iv. 16,—eiselthe, he went,—«*,—inuf the
synagogue. And so :—
Luke iv. 39; vi 4 ; viii. 32, 33, 51; ix. 4 ;
x. 5, 8, 10; xiv. 23; xv. 28 ; xvii. 12 ; xix 45;
xxii. 3, 10.; xxiv. 1,3, 26.; John iii. 4.; xiii. 27 ;
Acts xiv. 1; xvi. 15, 40 ; xviii. 19.
Iu St. John’s gospel, chap. xx. 3, 6, there is a
most striking exemplification of the rule m ques.
tion : “ Peter, therefore, went forth, and that other
disciple, and came,—eis—to ’the sepulchre. So
they rah both together, and the other disciple did
outrun Peter, and came first,—eis,—to the sepul
chre. 1 hen cometh Simon Peter following him,
and eisellhen,—went,—eis,—into, the sepulchre.!’
In the third and fourth verses of the above scrip
ture, it is twice said that they came to the sepui.
chre, and in both these instances eis is used only
before the noun. But in the sixth verse it is said
that Peter went into the sepulchre, and there the
eti is doubled according to the rule,—being used
both before the verb of motion and before the noun
signifying the place into which the motion is per
formed, as shown above. A more striking iilus
traiion of the rule in question could not be con
ceived or given.
Prolessor Stuart says that ewerchomai—the
very verb used in all the above quotations, or em
baiuo, in distinction from katabaino, is the appro,
priate word for entering into a place or thing, and
he is high authority. Will you put him in the
category of your “dunces J” -
And now, sir, what <o you think of the rule at
which you sneered so significantly 1 and about
which you think l so bedunced myself. I have,
after a shorf search, produced some twenty-five
texts of Scripture to support that rule, and if ne
cessary 1 could soon produce as many more Do
you still think it “ strange that I should make a
dunce of myself on borrowed capital V’ Well, I
would as soon be a “ dunce” on “ borrowed capi
tal," as to be a “ dunce” on no capital at all. But
it turns out, that the “ borrowed capital” of
which you speak, and on w hich you say 1 have be
dunced myself, is taken from the living Oracles of
God. Do you think that the inspired writers from
whom I have quoted were “ dunces 1” Then how
little did it avail them that they were inspired
from above, and what a pity that they were not
favoured with the sage counsel of the very serene
editor of the Bib. Rec.!
It might be considered presumptious in me to
question your right to measure other men’s brains,
and dub as dunces whom you please. Then let it
be conceded that you do actually carry the line and
plummet of truth, and that you possess the rare fa
faculty of fathoming and scanning, at a single
glance, the mental calibre of others; and let me
patiently submit, for your serene highness stoops
to call me a “ dunce.” But, alter all, it is not
quite so bad to be a “ dunce,” as 1 had antici
pated ; for 1 find that a very knowing editor of a
religious newspaper, published in the capital of
North Carolina, has made my duuceship the cap
tion for some of his most handsome effusions.
Who would not be called a “dunce” for such an
honour 1
But seriously, sir; the more I examine, the more
I am convinced, that the rule in question, as laid
down in my pamphlet, stands upon a basis of truth,
which puts at defiance all your nibbling and car*
ping. It is true that you have trumped up one fan
cied objection to the rule. In speaking of the
herd of swine that ran violently down a steep place
into the sea—Matt. viii. 32 ; you say :—“Here it
will be perceived that the verb of motion, ormese,
is formed without the preposition ets. Now, sir, all
lexicographers agree that Ormao, from which is
“ormese,” means to rouse, to animate, to rush, to
rush forward and attack, &c., and not one of them
says it means to enter deliberately into a place or
thing. Parkhurst says that in the New Testament,
it means “to rush violently or impetuously.”
Then this verb of motion, as used in the above pas
sage, is not used to express the eotrance into the
Bea, so much as, xo express the rushing violence
with which the swine ran down the steep place.
Now if it had been the prime object of the inspired
writer to express the entrance of the swine into
the sea, there is no doubt but he would have used
the verb etrerchomai, according to the almost uni
form custom ; but as it was his principal aim, in
this instance, to express the manner, in which the
evil spirits drove the swine, he uses the proper
word to convey that, idea. But if 1 admit the cor
rectness of your exception, you gain nothing by it;
for to all general rules there are some exceptions,
and.yet these exceptions do not invalidate the
rules. But you seem to think that your fancied'
exception, so vitiates my rule as to reduce me to
the necessity of drowning hogs on dry land. Well,
if I admit all that, then 1 might with propriety sug»
gest to you the truth of the old adage, that “he
that lives in a glass house should not throw stones;”
for you hold that the Israelites were immersed in
their passage thro’ the Red sea, although the Sa
cred record 6ays they went over on dry ground.
Now, it strikes me that the idea of immeremg six
hundred thousand men, besides a multitude of we
| men and children,pn dry land, is equally m ridicn*
