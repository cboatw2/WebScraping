Southern Quarterly Review is. publishe
in the city of Charleston. and is under th
editorial tontrol of Mr.*D. K. W hitaker,
gentleman well known for his literary at
tainments. - The Review under his man
agement is a literary journal of high char
acter, and frequently contains political ani
miscellaneous articles, characterized b:
considerably ability. It is specially devo
ted to the defence of Southern lnstitu -nt
and consequently has peculiar clains upoi
citizens of the South. 'A number pub

complete and the ablest defence of Sla

alone was worth -a whole year's subscrip

ing this article, cannot fail to be convince
of the policy, the humanity and compara

amongst us. There are many excellen
articles scattered throughout this Review
but we will at present, only refer to on
on the subject of education, in -the numbe
for January, 1845. This is from the pei
of the Editor. 1n research and abundane
of' useful information-it surpasses an:
thuig upon education which we hav
read for years. It is worthy the attentioi
or all, and should be studied by parents
teachers and Legislators. We will no
attempt to give an abstract of this article
but will refer our readers to its careful pe

convenience, leave Columbia, to lectur
in any remote part of the State, prior t
the first of June. He would lie mo

upon the course wthich Judge Berrien,
WVbi2 Seniator fromi Georgia.pursued who
the bill for the admission oif Florida an
Iowa into the Union, came before the Sert
ate. Mr. Berrien supported the bill whic
pastedl, and in his remarks spoke like
Southern mnati on the question of slaver
- " The readers of our paper will believ
us, we trust, wthen we tell them that iti
moure congential to our feelings when wt
have to praise our fellow beings uhatn to ces
sure them. -It is with pleasure we eti
brace every occasion afforded us, to coim
mend th.' actions of our public mei
whether opponents or friends, and it is a
ways with regret that we have to condemi
what we believe to be wrong in the
conduct. But we havena duty to perfort
as phblic joturnalists'w hich cannot 'he di
regarded. That duty has compelled ust
more than one occasion, to censure ti
courso pursued hy ~one of our Senatorsi
Congress, especially in regard to the al
nexatiotn of Texas. It is then with pies
sure we embrace the occasion toe-ay, t h
in one instance the course pursued by M~
Berrieni has heetn that of a southern senaic
without forgetting at the same time that I
was a member of the Senate of the U.
Our readers will find on the first page
this day's paper. some extracts from ti
remarks moads by that gentleman, in ti
Senate, wheni the bill for the admission

- Origin of Temperance Societie.-M
have more than once been untewogated
it respects the origin of Temnperanea
sociationis, and have therefore concludi
to devote a few thoughts this week, to
consideration of the subject. The pl1
of voluntary association for the attainme
of a prescribed and slefinite object, h
found a place in human affairs from 1
earliest times, for on this principle w
based the presumptuous and daring
tempt to build a tower whose head shot
reach unte Heaven; and all history, bc
sacred and profanie, abounds with exar
pies of 'voluntary leagues and covenar
~for good or evil, bet weetn individuals, al
among coir munities. A society has exi
ted faor more than 1844. years whose mer
bers, pledged to a pure and divinie morali

served to arouse the fiendish spirit of tt
elder Herod. and the slaughtar of the chi

promised advent 'of the mighty Savior <
t the world. Thus from the uins of th

The first Society of which we have Rn
well authentical record, and based on th

Von Raumer on Ite Slavery Question.
e We fiud in the Deutche Scltnellpost the
s following intimation of the view whichm has
d been taken of the Slavery question in this
country by Baron Von Raumer, whose
work may shortly be expected from the
r press:
0 Frederick Von Raumer, lately in Ber
lin, at the I Science-union," lectured on
his travels through North America, and
d indeed, principally on Slavery in the U
v States. He merely enumerated the sav
e eral grounds established by the most emi
neot anti Abolitionists, for retainittg the
present condition of slaves in the South
urn States, and especially endeavored to
e show that the condition of the slaves, as
existing in North America, in many re.
spects was to be preferred to the position.
Sof our (Prussians) proletariatns, or wvork
tmen etmployed in factories, and this too,
both for the slaves and the moral and po
liticatl idea of the Republic.
The lecturer seemed to be itnclined to,
approve of these views, although he de
t cidedly admitted the dillicujlties in remnov
i ing the present respective condition, in
-such a way as not either to violate an ex.
-isting right of propmerty, or place the oe
h gr:oes in a condition far worse for them.
1. At all events, the lecture from its spirit.
o is to lie st yled an "anti- abolitionist one,"
f and, therefore, may be supposed to have
n met wvith much opposition from the ladies
t present, atnd such persons generally as do
~not consider any progress imp~osstble at
which the human mind earnestly aims.
