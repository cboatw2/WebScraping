were raised by this bill from nothing tc

be making the fortunes of others. Thc
anotion was seconded by Mr. Bienton. H e
said the foreign commerce of New Orlean

number of'witnesses of the fistr i~eta.
Itility. I reel inde6aifed in. ma ? the
statement. The facts itre follows:
On Saturday last a'youn uTan prought
to my ofiee a small piece or tobacco leaf,
with an apparent drop of coagulated blood
upon it, and requested an analysiof it
L stating that the substance uponithe leaf
I ha'l fallen from a cloud in the heavens.
r This excited my curiosity, and led me to
make particular inquiry ralativ i this
r strange phenomenon. I ascertained that
-ir. J. M. Peyton, of Labanon, w in the
neighborhood at the time thistrang esbow
1 er fell which led me to inquire oftim.
- Mr. P's statement was, that he was at the
- house of Mr. E. M. Chandler, living on
. Spring creek, about five miles from Leba
- non, on Friday last ; that about I or 2
i o'clock, P. M.. two or Mr. Chandlar's ne
e groes came in from the tobacco nld, where
e they had been at work, and stated to their
I master that it had been raining blood in the
a tobaccofield. Whereupon, Mr. Chandler,
accompanied by Mr. Peyton and Mr. D.
y Dew, returned with the negroesad round,
J promiscuously scattered over a portion of
s the field, drops of blood, adheringto the to
e bacco leaves. This statement Q(Ar. Pey
y ton's-he being a gentleman of srict ver
.t acity-induced me to go in person to the
at spot and examine for myselr. Aecording
f. ly, on Suniday last, I went to the-house of
e .Mr. Ch::ndler, who, in company, with Mr.
T. R. Jae'en an:! John Jackson, pro
it ceeded wish them to tia: tobavg r'ound.
o Mr. Chandler smated, in substance, the
* same that Sir. Poyon had stated; that his
y negroes were at work in the tobacco, and
it about half past II or 12 o'clock a rattling
| noise like rain or hail was heard by them
ci falling round, which they soon found to be
a drops of blood falling. On looking uip.
i the negroes state they saw a small red
a cloud, passing swiftly fron east to west,
immediately over their heads, and which,
soon*nfter passing over them, disappeared
entirely.
Mr. Chatidler and Mr. Peyton visited
the place, about 3 o'clock the same even
ing, and found, as they thought, drops of
blood and small portions of flesh. aIr. C.
stated that he foesid a piece which he
thought nhout half flesh ant; balf fat, an
inch and a half or two i::ches ;ing, all of
o which produced a very oifensive smell, ex
e tending all over the tield.
Aly visit was not until Sunday evening,
about fifty hours fron the tiue the matter
fell; at that iime, there was no odor per
ceptible, except when the particles were
i brought very near the smell was i very
y offensive. I examined the dro the
tobacco leaves, and satisfied mi .
they had fallen perpendictlarly

I the shower, and ascertained it'

I am happy to say our prospects bright

Nne of the bands have any ind ueement
for remaining out any longer, they fnd they t
cannot remain in the country unmolested; a
their crops have been thoroughly destroyed.
and themselves driven from place to place,
to the great discomfiture and suffering of
their women and children. Those who
have already come in were in the most ab- d
ject state of wretchedness, with scarcely a e
vestige of clot hing-literally in-shreds and
patches. I have seen enough of Indians Y
to know that they are by no means indif.
ferent to the comforis of life, whatever may
be said of their endurance of privations, E
and yet there is a character about them truly
Roman. I witnessed a scene hers, a few
days ago, which, in my humble opinlion, d
puts the story of Damou and Pythias quite s
;: !he shade. A party of Intlians were re- d
cently discovered by some of our troops, %
who succeeded in capturing three of the
menand several women and children, num
bering in all about twenty, fled. The cap
tives were brought to this place, where
they were interrogated by the Colonel, du- c
ring which it was discovered that two of '
them had been concerned in killing and d
huruing a mail rider, some time in March 3
last. lhey were told that for this conduct b
of thcirs they would be hung in fifteen
days, unless within that time the rest of
their people should come in. They were
then placed in chains, and were per-nitted
to senad out tie third man of their party 1
with a talk to bring in the rest of their ien
ple, while they themselves were commit
ted to the guard. The man thus sent out
returned in five days, biintging with him a I
warrior by the name of Holati Firico, and j
some women und children, among whomts
were the tnother and sister of one of the
prisoners, whose namie is Talofq-adjo,
TIc scene that followed may be dratiati

TIlE MIlLITIA LAWS.
The Legis'ature at the last Session having
refused to revise the Mfilitia Laws of dais State,
antd hmving~ by the Act to alter and amend them,
r.pe'a-d Brigade Encampments. and restored
company Court, Martial as they were pratised
antmer"r to 1833 with the power to appoint a
collector of the fines, it may be well to enquire,
wheier these subjects are or sufficient impor
tlnce to riqulire a recotuuideraftos. It is not
surprisin!, that since the organization of the
M ilitia ii. 179-4, the almost annual accumulation
o'a statute on die subject, should in such a long
lapse of time, have swelled into a mighty mass
o' indigesed, incongruous. and almost incom'
prhnsible laws; the revision of such crude
aid comliesicted ma'trials will be no light 3s
bor, bt it has become indispensably necessary
t be done, aid if sel done, will be wordh to the
8State, ten times as much as it reasonably can
cosl; the day of Law Reforen has already begun
to dawn upon us, and aithough its morning
may be occasIonally overcast with clouds, a
bright meredian will crown its career, and the
people will hail its enlivening light with grati
tude, joy. aud applause. It is surely sound
policy iu every good government, and but jus.
tice to its citizens, diat its laws, especially it
statutes, should not only be plain, practical and
xpediet, but certain and intelligible; and
to be generally useful they must be easily ac
eessible to all.
What is the present condition of the Militia
Laws? They lie scatterred through the Acts of
e General Assembly from 1794 to 1840. and
ire now not only exceedingly diflicult to be ob
ained, but the expense of purchasaig them,.
>lace them beyond the meeans of most men, and
f possessed. there are few that can find the

itle; and he must have as much leisure as a
tafer, stnd more patience than the patriarch,
bat can cheerfully spend his time in the painful
iursuit f"butinig a needle in a hay-stack."
The cnmpilationf of the Statues at Large will,
when It shall have been completed) effect the
