Correspondence of the Charleston Courier.
Washington, April 22.
The JIoDse was disgraced yesterday, by
a scene of disorder and personal violence,
such has been rarely witnessed even in
that body.
Mr. Saltonstall had the floor, i i committee
of the whole, and was speaking ol
the attempt of the Globe, to discredit some
*** 1 * * ? * r\AnrlihlfOC
official statements as iu wiu ?|icuui?ii>vv
of the Government. The Globe, iu an article
headed "federal tricks, people ol
Virginia be on your guard," stales that a
handbill, signed by seven or eight members
of the House, containing a statement
of public accounts that, without explanation,
was calculated to make "a most
false and foul impression on the public
mind," had been extensively circulated in
Virginia. The Globe explains the matter
so as to shew that the "items are not
made up in such a manner as to present a
true state of the public expenses," though
it was circulated as an official document.
Among the signers of the handbill were
Mr. Rice Garland, Mr. Saltonstall,
and Mr. Botts* Mr. Wise rase to make
some further explanation on the subject,
as his colleague (Mr. Botts) was absent.
Ho ?n.i <11,>l rrwnnnrpil the handbill and
ibIIU ?
the official document to which it refers,
and challenged any one to point out any
variation, except in the statements marked
"unofficial.'' While Mr. Wise was
speaking on the subject, an outcry and
noise suddenly arose on the left of the
Chair, and two of the members, Rice
Garland of Louisiana, and Jesse A. Bvnuji
of North Carolina, were observed in
close and violent conllict. There was a
rush to the spot. Mr. Evans seized Mr
I3yncji, and .Mr. Banks and others laid
hold of Mr. Garland, and other persons
crowding between them, the combatan's
were separated. The Chairman, in the
mean time, implored the members, f-n
the sake of their own characters?for the
sake of the country, to preserve order.?
The speaker was called for and some call
ed for the Sergeant at Arms. Some few
were opposed to any attempt to separate
the parties?declaring that, as they could
not light as gentlemen, they ought to fight
in some other way. The speaker took
the Chair and endeavored to bring the
House to order Mr. Bynim, after being
dragged away, continued to menace anti
dare his antagonist.
At length, order was restored, and Mr.
Dromooole said he was an advocate of order,
and he hoped the matter would have
an immediate investigation, and thai ^itcharacter
of the House would be supported,
regardless of consequences to individuals.
Mr. Bricgs said, it had long
been remarked, that something murt be
done to change the manners of this Mouse,
or that it must be dissolved. We had
now come to a point in which personal
abuse must cease or the Mouse be broken
up. Mr. Banks said the character of to is
body had undergone a melancholy change.
Gross vulgarity, and personal violence
were as common here, every day, as 011
the muster ground or the race field. If
this state of things continued, we must go
home and tell the people, that party spirit
or some snirit had seized upon this body
and utterly destroyed its character and
utility. Other members spoke, in the
same strain. At length a resolution was
. adopted for the appointment of u committee
of five members to investigate the facts
of the disorder and personal violence oc
curring this day, in the House, between
two of i:s members, with power to send
for persons, and directions to report with
all proper dispatch. The Committee
were directed to go into session immediately.
Mr. Wise expressed the hope that the
matter would not be suffered to go over
to another day. It was supposed that the
committee would soon report; but they
did not report, though they went out at
two o'clock, and the House was in session
till eleven o'clock at night.
It appears that while Mr. Wise was
speaking on the subject of the handbill,
many members were conversing about it
in an excited^nunner. Mr. Cyspm, who.
by the way, is out of health, and is seldom
in the House, was passing between the
desks, near Mr. K. Garland's seat, and
remarked, in allusion to the circular, "it
looks very suspicious, coming out ns it
did on the eve of the Virginia election."
M-. Garland turned tn him, saving.
"you are a d 1 liar;" "villain"
"tkiej," OC.C. was quirKiy rnorieu. .?ir.
Garland collareil Mr. Bv.vu.n, arid blows
were interchanged. Mr. Bynvm endeavored
to get out his penknife, but did not
succeed in time to use it. Neither party
, was-hurt.
1 presume the House will drop the matter.
It will not serve as an admonition of
the necessity o( preserving personal decorum;
for, in the course of the same day,
- 1 .-?? r% rro n rocnrfp/1 in

The discussion was continued in committee
by Mr. Saltonstall. Mr. Jameson,
Mr Ogle, and Mr. Davis of Kv., till
eleven o'clock, when the committee rose
and the House adjourned.

I THE NEW TARIFF MOVEMENT.
The intimate relation which Mr. Cal[
houn demonstrated in his late speech, to
exist between the assumption of the State
Debts, and the renewal of the Tariff seems
I to have been understood though denied or
i! evaded, by the friends of that monstrous
' proposition. It is a connection, now, not
i. more established by logic than by fact,
i and evety day is accumulating the evidence.
,!Mr. Clay, the great champion of thcTajriff,
is also the projector of the measure
for paying the State Debts by the proceeds
of the public lands. Tariff Conventions
have been held in Massachusetts, in Connecticut,
in Rhode Island and Pennsylvania.
In the same presses throughout the
North, we find the two topics of distribu4
~ nnnoco/] twilli nnun 1 arrlor
r (Kill 3 UU 1 at ill |/i Qoauu vr ?
| They are nearest to kin, and not more re,
markable for their direct affinity, than for
the injustice and oppression which they
equally threaten to the producing region
of the South. The operation of the Tariff
has been often pointed out. The
States of South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama,
Mississippi, Louisiana, and Arkansas,
furnish about tivo thirds of the exports,
oil the produce of which the duties
are levied. The only part of the revenues
of the Government which are not
raised from them in that proportion, arise
from the public lands. It is now proposed,
at a time when, with its utmost means the
Government can hardly pay its expenditures,
to take away the revenue arising
from the public lands and distribute a
among the States. The entire expenditure
of the Government must then be provided
for out of the duties levied imported
goods, the exchanges for our cotton.?
The distribution of the puslic lands is proposed
to be made according to the ratio
of representation in Congress. Lei us see
how that would affect the cotton growing
Slates. The six States above enumerated,
have 29 Representatives in Congiess, out
of 243?less than one eighth of the whole.
While they would pay, therefore, two
thirds of the additional duties to replace
the revenue from the public lands, they
would receive bv the distribution scheme,
less than one eighth of that revenue. The
justice and equality of that scheme has
been laude ! by its author and his partizans
?by the !*?tate Legislatures and grave assemblies?the
justice "f pi inhering one
section fir the benefit of another! the equality
of the lion and the fox! But the scheme
does not end here. The movement at the
North is directed not merely t<> an inrrease
of duties,"but to the restoration of a Ta
riff of protection. We find revived aim
cherished by Conventions, petitions to
Congress and the newspappr press, all the
rankest doctrines of the old Tariff school.
Not long since, a Senator from New Jerscy
presented a petition from certain manufacturers
(of lace we believe) praying an
increase of duty on their branch, and staling
as their grievance, that under the preseni
duties, fo-eign lace of the very best
quality could be imported and sold for less
than their own, which was of the coarsest!
Congress was asked to exclude a valuable
fabric, to encourage the manufacture of a
miserable and worthless counterfeit. The
impudence of this reason could only be
equalled by a petition from the late Cashier
of the Schuylkill Bank, praying for a
heavy penalty to be laid on all kinds of
hon*sty, on the ground that a* things arc:
going, ilu* rascals found serious obstacles
in the way of their monopolising ever)
profitable offi"e in the country! Yet the
petition of the Newark, lacemakers, with I
its barefaced and solid impudence, embodies
the very essence of the protective
system. Have these people of the North
really no honest occupation they can take
to? Must the Union be forever harrassed
by their schemes for making money, not
only at the expense of their neighbors,
but of the constitution and every principle
of republicanism? Do they wish to
make the Federal Union a perpetual ana
grinding tyranny upon the South? Do they
not see that the nerseverina obstinacy with
which they burden the Union, not only
with all their selfishness, but all their fanaticism?insisting
that one half its time
shall be given to filling their purses, and
the other half to gratifying their passions,
perfectly reckless that the first is to be attained
only by legalized robbery, and the
second only by sanctioning murder, insurrection
and the utter destruction of one
half the confederacy?do they not sec
that by this incessant warfare upon every
principle of justice, equality, tolerntion
and brotherly kindness, they are daily
dgging down the foundations of this no:
bin Union, and making its continuance
j impossible.' that so sure as we have loved
I it us ilu? cruHi-dian of neaee. liberty and
justice, so sure shall we hate and renounce
it, if it is to be turned into a rod tu
scourge, or a serpent to sling us?

Havana, March?, 1840.
The frigate Macedonian, Captain Ken-|
non, with the flag of Commodore 8hu
brick, and the sloop of war Levant, Com-.
mander Smoot, arrived in this harbor on ;
tlie 17ih, from a cruise to windward of:
three and a half months, during which se-1
veral ports were visited, at which no Ame-,
rican frigate had ever before anchored. |
The Commodore and his officers were i
received with the greatest kindness and!
hospitality everywhere almost; but especially
at St Pierre's Martinique, were they
welcomed with fraternal ardor?every
house was thrown open to them?no olii*
ccr was permitted to go to a hole!?
, parlies were made every morning, and
horses provided for them to ride into the
country?breakfasts, and such breakfasts!!!!
sumptuous as the feastings at Camancho's
wedding?dinners and balls followed
in quick succession. On the other
hand, the two ships were thrown open to
all visiters?cake and wine provided in the
Commodore's cabin?and the fine little
band of the Macedonian kept constantly
in requisition, for scarcely a^air Martiniquean
left the ship without having whirled
more than once around the deck in the giddy
waltz with some of the gallant young
A merirnns.
The ships went as far to windward as
Barbadoes, at which place, there being a
good deal of small-pox 011 the island, the
Commodore did not deem it prudent to remain
more than twenty-four hours. No
officer visited the shore, and there was no
communication with any of the authorities
of the island except the health officer;
the usual salute of twenty-one guns was
tired by the Macedonian, and immediately
returned by the fort.
Vicc-Admiral Sir Thomas Marvej, Commander-in-Chief
on the North American
station, was at Barbadoes, with his flag
on the Winchester frigate. When our
ships anchored he sent a lieutenant on
board the Macedonian with the customary
offer of services, &c. but did not call on
o,ur Commodore, or show any disposition
to be civil. Was it that the names of the
ships sounded unpleasantly in his ears?
Or is it that all foreign officers of rank ere
determined to make our officers feci, and
feel to the heart's core, too, the anomalous
situation in which they are kept?
with high and important commands, but
without the rank which would give them
a right to meet officers of other navies,
holding similar and not more important
commands, on nn equal fooling. They
must now receive that as a concession,
when they receive it at all, to which a just
government would give them a right; but!
this is a subject for those to discuss who
arc immediately concerned in it, and 1
have something more to say about our
cruise.
The commerce of the United States with
the West India islands has evidently tiecreased
since I was in these seas, some
ten years since. Even at the free port of
St. Thomas's, now more frequented than
any other port of the islands, except Ha
vana, we found but 30 American vessels;
at St. Job's Porto Rico, only seven; and
a: Cape Haytien, St. Domingo, only one
I state the fact, and leave it to politibians
to trace the effect to its cause.
France does not allow su?ar to be taken \
irom her islands in any other than French
bottoms. The absurd system pursued by
England with her black population has
ruined her colonies: and the two Spanish
islands, Cuba and Porto Rico, will in a
few jears, if they do not already, produce
more than all the other islands together.
It is to be observed, however, that
on the latter island the slave population is
small being only about 60,000 to 400,000
whites. The island is very fertile, is divided
into small plantations and cultivated
principally by whites of the same manners
ami habits as the peasantry of old Spain.
We go from this in a few days for Pensacola;
but all is dark as to where we arc
tit go from thence?whether down the Gulf,
or as some of us fondly hope, to the north,
nr one knows, except perhaps the Commodore,
and these Commodores have an
ugly fashion of keeping their own counsel.
You will hardly believe it when 1
tell .you, but i> is a fact, that the Ontario
went to sea last summer, and even her j
own officers did not know where she was :
bound until they had been some da3's out. j

ry anti-rcpublican. Think of sending ;i
number of freemen to sea without letting,
them know whether they are going to

'and oppressive; besides, how are the I
I young officers to keep the gentlemen of\
the press informed of the intended move-;
' toe ts,of the ships? Would it not be well
if Congress should pass a law that the offi- j
cers and men too shall be consulted as to
their destination? As you hold the pen of

INVASION OF TEXAS. j
I New-Orleans, April 17. ;
The arrival from TexaB yesterday of the
steampacket Neptune, brings intelligence j
of the defeat of the Federalists near Nice
* *"* ' r>a t ran t will*
on trie mo uraiiuui ww., ..........
great loss to San Antonio, in Texas, anil |
the pursuit by an army of fifteen hundred j
Centralists, supposed to be within a day's j
march of San Antonio. Whether the
Centralists tinder Arista, contemplate an
invasion ol Texas, is not yet ascertained.
The impression is, the pursuing will stop
within a short distance of San Antonio,
and demand the surrender of Canalcs and
[his troops. The smauness ox ine cnc-i
| my's force contradicts the supposition that
tlioy meditate an inroad upon Texas. It'
is also staled that a Irnce had been enter-!
ed into between the Mexican and Texianj
Governments, which would prohibit any
movement of the kind. However this'
may be, the news has created no little;
alarm in Texas, and the population are;
arming to meet the invader, if such should ^
be his character. The sudden approach:
of the Mexicans, seem to have taken the
TSxian Government by surprise. No preparations
had been made to receive them.
The force at Sail Antonio consisted only
of three companies. The nearest re-iuforcement
was a detachment of of three
hundred men, under General Burleson,
at the city of Austin, whose arrival was
expected in two or three days. It was
thought that this small body of Texians
aided by the fugitive Federalists, would
present a front formidable enough to stop
the progress of Arista.
The Houston papers express the opinion
that the only object of the movement
was the capture of the defeated enemy,
and that no idea of taking possession of
, any part of Texas ever entered into the
I plans of the Centralist Generad. The
j ever.t which occurred was to be expected.
! For in case of defeat, the Federalists have
I no place of refuge but Texas; whither of
I course, the victorious enemy would pur|
sue them. In such a state of things, the
I nublic authorities of Texas are deservedly
censured for neglect, in not keeping a well
| equipped military force near the frontier,
i to keep in check the successful party.?
(The inhabitants, however, are used to
arms and lighting, and if time enough is
allowed to gather them, an army will soon
be raised that can soon drive back Arista
and his fifteen hundred men. The next
news from Texas may be awaited with
deepest interest, as we shall then learn
whether the advance of Arista is a merepursuit
of the Hying Federalists *or an invasion
of Texas. If the latter should turn
out to he the plan of the Mexican General,
the event may be deemed important. The
Texians will not rest content this time in
repelling the foe. They will pursue the
I retreating invader, preach tip a crusade
against the fertile and tempting provinces
! of the interior, and gathering around them
the adventurous, daring and ambitious
spirits that now throng the United Stalesmarch
an army of ten thousand men across
the Rio Grande, and begin an invasion
that must end, no doubt, in the conquest
and entire subjugation of Mexico. The
same result, in the ordinary course of
things, may be counted on as certain; but
the event would be greatly accellerated,
should the movement of Aiista prove an
actual invasion,

Attempt at Murder and Suicide.?We
publish below a letter from North Rrook|
(ieltl, detailing- one of the most singular
cases of crime, which our columns hare
chronicled for a long time:
Brookiim.n, April II, 1S10.
Whipple iiartlett, a man about 23 years
old, committed suicide last Thursday
[ night under the following circumstances.
I Mr. Nathaniel Snow owed him about twenI
ty-fivc dollars, which he was unable to
j pay, and as Bartlett was a miser in bis disi
position, it was a source of great vexation
| to him, and he had intimated to S.;ow that
i if he did not pay him, he would get satis'faction
in some other way. Mr* Ashcr
i Rice also owed him three or four dollars,
i -1- i> r i
WHICH Liurucil 1CII11U II uuiiuuit IU kUHtki
of him. Under these circumstances, lie
came to the conclusion to seek revenge by
taking their lives and then destroying his
own. To carry out this plan, he went to
New Braintrec and bought a load of dry
wood, and got the privilege of laying the
same in a pasture in Brookfield.
j lie then collected all his property of
every kind?packed his clothes in a trunk,
and carried the trunk to a house near the
j place where he had left the wood, and
told the people he would call for it on
Thursday, or some time in the night.?
On Thursday afternoon he hired a horse
and wagon, and started for North Brook1
field.
i On the way he met his brother, and
told him he wanted to sell him his axe and
- - - i -i- i - i; .1 I j
fishing spear, which ne cuu, anu iiisisicu
upon having the pay for them on the spot,
as lie sai'l he wanted every cent that was
due to him.
He was next heard of at Asher Rice's,!
where lie called and asked Rice if he could
pay him what he owed him. Rice told
him he could not. " That is very strange,"
said Barllctt, "you said you would pay
me by the 1st of April." And upon that
he drew, a pistol and was about to tire at
Rice, which he discovering, pushed him
out of the door, lie then went to Nathaniel
Snow's, and arrived there aboyt
10 o'clock. He knocked at the door, and
Mr. Snow opened it, and asked him to
walk in. lie again drew a pistol, and
tired at Snow, and hit him on his breast
bone?the force of the ball being broken
hv strikino airainst a metal button 011 his
O D
vest.
lie then drove to the house where he
had left his trunk, took it and drove to
the place where he had left the load of
wood. There he deposited his trunk and
other effects, and look his horse out into
the road?took his horse out of the shafts,
and hitched him to the fence, put a buffalo
skin on him, and returned to his funeral
pile. He placet! himself in such a position
that he thought he would fall on the
wood, which he had previously set on tire,
and on wmcn tic nan inrown ait fus propert}*.
lie then blew bis brains out with
a pistol, but when he fell he did not f, II on
the wood, as lie intended, but fell down j
by the side of it. In this situation lie
was found next day. with one hand burn'.'
off and one side of Ills face burnt (o a
coal.
It appears that his intention was to destroy
himself and all his property, even to
the last cent. And as his axe and spear
would not burn, he sold them for money.
In the ashes of the fire was found about
41 oz. of melted silver, and in his pocket'
70 or SO dollars in bills, and his two watches.
'Three pistols lay by his side, provided,
one for Rice, one for Snow, and one
for himself.
Snow was not much hurt by the ball,
and was able to attend the funeral of Bart/
let yesterday.
Iiartlctt was a very singular man. The
only object that he was known to love
was money?and he has said that he would
not outlive his property. From a child
he was remarkably taciturn, and was
scarcely ever known to smile.

The Robbers Again.?On Wednesday night last,
or rather on Thursday mcrning. about four o'clock,
an ur.succesful attempt was made to force the brick
fire proof safe of Messrs. C. & F. Matheson, attachcd
to their counting room. One of the young
I men who sleep in the store was aroused by the noiso
j of the villains, and on making his appearance at the
door, thry fled towards the hack lot; ho then rcturnI
ed. nut oil his cloak and took a ni?tol with him: oil
reaching Ihc back lot, he discovered two persons
whom he took to be negroes, secreted in a corner
formed by tho fence and the back store. They immediately
fled on his approach, when he fired 011
I them, but with what effect; if any, is not known.?
jOnc of them appeared to be a tall fellow dressed
in a round jacket.
UTWc publish the communication of our correspondent
" Aquarius," more for its fine vein of humour,
than to give the desired hint to our " town authoii'.ies,"
(though we have no objection to their taking
it) for we scarcely think it their duty to furnish buckets
to private wells; ar.d if we mistake not, the one
alluded to is of that character.
BjTTIic Charleston Mercury has laid us under obligations
for the corrections which it has been kind
enough to make in relation to an article in this paper;
if however the Editor intended to do rs justice,
hehas not gone far enough. When he says "we
only meant that it (\\\e/Journal) did speak by tho
authority of the Camden Bank," he should havo added
that we denied that assertion; with this we should
have been content, leaving the question of veracity
to bo settled by our respective readers. The Mercury
says otir article bears a " curious resemblance to
the private answer to the Bank of tho State, inquiring
whether" the Bank of Camden " were prepared
to redeem either at their (its) counter or in Charleston,
such of their (its) notes as should be received
for taxes" and add: ; ' the Journal says nothing to
l this point." IIow could it? We had not before heard
\ that such a point had been made. We will now say,
| however, that since our attention has been called to
the sul'ji-ct, we have been politely permitted to see
the "private answer" referred to by the Mercury,
and have r.ot been able to detect the " curious resemblancc"
of which it speaks?the fact is, we cannot
say that we feel greatly complimented by the comparison,
though this i t a point upon which we hope
tiiat paper will maintain the most profound silence,
as it is only our private opinion.'.'
Steam Boat Accident.?The Steamer Camden.
Capt. Donxkix, which had been detained here for
several days, in consequence of low water, got off
on Thursday last with the aid of the slight swell in
the river, caused by the rain of the previous day.?
She had proceeded but a very short distance below
Mrs. McRa's plantation when, in turning a point,
she struck a snag and went down in a few minutes.
\Vc learn from a gentleman who has been to the
boat since the accident, that her hull is full of water,
up to the hatches, and that her position was such as
to lead to the presumption that she had broken in the
centre, and will probably be a total loss, She had
011 board 233 hales of cotton, and a quantity of
yarn, and oznaburgs, from the DcKa'b Factory.?
The yarn must bo a total loss, and the cotton and
< saalu-gs, must l? greatly damaged and perhaps a
; large portion of it entirely lost. The Camden has
S been peculiarly unfortunate in her navigation of tho
Watercc; on her previous trip, she was snagged and
sunk near Bcntly. The frequent occurrence of these
accidents will, we fear, have the edict of putting
an cna 10 steam ooat navigation on our river.
April Shown*.?The past month has not been fo
prolific of these Spring visitors, as in former years;
but on Wednesday last all arrears were brought up.
i On that day in the afternoon, we scarcely ever remember
to have seen as much water fall in the same
time as did then in the course of an hour. In the
spring of 1S3(1, we had a visitation somewhat similar,
but witli?that exception, wo have never seen tho
streets of Camden so completely flooded with water.
The flood rose to the height of several inches in all
our principal streets, and in some of these that were
low, the water was from two to three feet deep. It
rose so high as to run into some of the stores on Broad
Street, but we have heard of no damage being done
I except the washing away of tho garden fences in seI
vcral parts of the town, and giving of our town au'

i when the rain commenced) he had to wade through
1 one of our principal streets at least three hundred
