FeUoiw Citizens the Senate,
and Howe 0presentatives.
Since your last meeting, we have had
reason to be grateftil for many blessings of
a kind Providence. With one unfortu
nate exceptiol, every quarter of tihe State
has been favored with an unusual share
of health; and the industry of her citizens
in the cnlture of the soil is rewarded, if not
-with an overflowing harvest, with enough
at least to iatisfy their reasonable desires. in
the distress and embarrassments of I lie past,
it is to be hoped they have learned a lesson
of-ugality and prudend' r the future.
To husband with econ'only and enjoy wit h
moderation. isthe best return we can make
to the dispenser or good for the favours
which his wisdom has -onlerred.
- ~ When we were lately convened under
these walls,the hand of aflction was heavy
upon us. Enterprise was palsied,commerce
was prostrated, tie circulation, the life
blood of coninmerce, was tainted with in
security anti disorder. Our agricultural
interests felt deeply the general distraction;
its products were depreciated to a degree
.that left to the dispirited planter a bare
rennmeration for his toil. I am huppy
now to join with you in rejoicing at the
commencement of a better state of things.
Ve -have weathered the gale amd the sun
shines again: cheerfulness and confidence
are:restored: credit is sgdin re-esablished:
tbe binks have resumed tihe fulfilment of
their obligations: Trade has returned with
life anod vigor to its wonted chainels-and
our crops reinstated in value, are again lie
come a fund of prosperity and wealth.
The Bank of the State, well and judi
cigtisly conducted, coutinues,as heretofore,
to be an advantage to time people, and
profit and convenience to time country.
k"or a fuill and detailed statent of' the af

The care of the State nmilitin includes
a large ,spare of thme dutiles of your E xecu
tiver I have thmerefoire held it, throtughott
the stermn of2hervice, in esp)ecial regard, tand
sNatchied with much solicitude time opera
tioh of the several pr'ovisionms you have
made for tihe.improvemnt of' this imapor
tant arm of Defenmc. -I have reviewed
every regiment of inifantr'y mn tihe State (46
in number, and six out of the seven regi
ments of cavalry.
Tio the much wit amid sarcasem that ini
genuity has artrayedl against tIhe militia ser
vice, it would he qutite out of place here
to answer. T1hie soldier of' twelve days in
the year, ;wlll hardly he compared ini skill
or disciplitie, with the solier by prof'ession
aud by the practice-of a lif'e time. limt if
the b)est nillitia are only very imuperfect
soldiers, what would you expect from the
w~orst! And let it be remember-ed that,
good or had, ignorant or intelligent, spirit
ed or wvithout spirit, as your wvise or care
less legislation may aflect them, your mni
* litia are still yoeur only mens of protection.
In the appeal to force, which every State
pretendling to the character of inidepemn
dlence must be prepared to meet, they are
your only airgunmentm, amid yomu must make
tliUmost of it. Thme amilitimi are nlot umm
provable. They have improved and(1nre
impJrovinig. 1mn mammy parts of' thme coun
try the inilitia ar'e every tIing tht could
be remasonably desired. Th'lis excelleme
has generally been tihe result of mime spirited
exertions 6f individnal oflicer'a, whose zeal
-and activity deserve to he encouraged b)y
the representatives of the State. WVhen
this species of public service shall be re
warded w,th it,s proper measure of appro
bation, the ditimmlty will at once cease of'
maintaining a well orgamnized amiliia.
The system of icnampments has wrmonghmt
thme best ellects. Its success lhas beeni such
that the imnconveniences. still arisimng fromt
defects in an experimenit co'lnparatively
new, should umnly ut-go us to a dIiltgent en
query' for the means to obviate them. In
- this spirit I beg leave to recommenid to
your consideration, 1st, the purchase of a
sujitable parade gromund for each burigade;
2nd, the issue of rations to oflicers attend
ing encampmecnts. The first of these
~propositions, . though a ppar-ently of lit tle
imnportancme will lie of essential advantage
in eff'ect. At present time conuvenienco or
caprice of individuals may at anyi, mnomeunt
defeam thme ordecrs of tihe Commianderin-~
ellief, and frustrate thme intentions of the
law. The a4toption of this measure will
also glvo an air of permanence to the sys- i
tem. The issue of rations wiltrelieve con- i
siderably the burthen of private expense,
In attending the encampments, and will i
initiate the soldier into a department of
military affatirs which it is somewhat int
portant he should understand. It will al
so tend to the better oroering of the camp,
and will facilitate th0e nforcing of disci
pline. Estimates are herewith submitted
of the probale expense of this provision
which is, inty opinion, too small to be
weighed against its many advautuges. It is
also very desirable for the perfecling of
our military system; that a digest should be
made of the iMilitia Laws, suited rather
for the instruction of officers than the refer
ence of lawyers. The Adjutant and In
spector General presents a combinatinn of
education and talent, especially well adap
ted to such a service. For this purpose
the Adjutant General might without ma
torial prejudice to his other duties, be re
lieved for one year from attendance on the
reviews.
In regard to our fire arms and other mu
nitions of war, circumstances have induced
me to institute a thorough examination.
which has resulted in the conviction, that
we should depend as far its possible for ouf
supply of these articles ont ourselves or on
sources within our control. I have the hon
or to submit to you a report of a Board of
Inspectors, appointed to examine the arms
and ammunition belonging to the State, in
the Arsenal at Charleston. It appears that
the ammunition obtained generally front a
broad,is not to he irusted in,frequently con
taining pents and corn,itstead olball & bick
shot ,and the like frauds. The Muskets
-as well as those imported from England
and the Norib, as from the United Sintes
hetories-are, fbr most part, good for tiii
ing, and dangerous. The old cariridges
have by my order beei all broken up, ad
a full supply of*very superior qutlitv has
been prepared by Mr. Charles Parker, of
the Magazine Guard of' Charleston; in re
gard to the armns,1 have been able to dlo 1to
thing iimore than exercise extreme vigilance
in purchasing. It is due to the U. States
government to acknowledge that the ob)
jectionable ardis received from their facto
ries were promptly exchanged for others.
These last have not yet been thoroughly
inspected, but there is reason to fear that
they arc not much better than those re
turned.
The alfairs of the College are in a con
dition to fullil the best wishes of its friends.
This institutior, has exercised a vair influ
ence over the character of the State, amat I
believe is destined4o he its palladium ot
salety, anidst the popular comiumotious
which so frequently agitate all free States.
Tihe knowledge acquired and the Iriend
ships contracted here. will be stronger than
popular violence. Those who have lorm
ed a good opiliniot of each other when they
were associated together in the intimacy of
unreserved communication, will retain and
cultivale a spirit of litierality and forgive
ness, even in tile heats of political hostili
ty. Our wise and prudent ancestors could
not have devised a more noble and effec
tual means of perpetuating their glorious
influencies over the destinies of their coun
try, than by the establishment of anl insti
tution of literature and Science tunder the
fostering caf'of the State, in which their
precepts wohtil be valued, apd their exam
pies appreciated. This institution should
ime- pnmary f)bject or Staie policy and
popular pride. It is the institution of the
people, and for e people. It is there they
must acquire . . intelligence to govern
themselves. Tihe Legislature should not
hesitate to make any appropriation which
the iuterests of the College may require.
The number of-sudents is rapidly increas
Ing, and is now far beyond aiy pecedent.
T'he presen)t number is about J70--and it
wvill probably be necessary, before long, to
manke a stil further addition to the build
ings, lor their comnfo'rtable accomminoda. ion.
t he Library, though respectable, cnntot
be compared wvithi several attaebed to ether
Universities in the Unuited States. Great
scholars anid erudite writers mtust have ac
cess to full Libraries, to make their labors
useful, and their productions accurate.
The State should take a p)ride in atlordlini
this facility to them, by having a libraty
which will give it ani initerest in the estima
tion) of p)osterity. atnd in the eyes of imtelli
gent foreignecrst with~ a view of attaitnn
this end. I beg leave to -recommaetnd to the
Legislat ute ani annutal appropriat ion, for
the piurchase of Books for the College li
brary.
The Free School system, as at present
cotiducted, does tnt appear to fullil the
bentevolent purposes intended to be elreet
ted by its establishament. I wiould recomt
mend theLfhPi app itet of a Boarid of
Cgmmatissionters to iamluire into this sutbject,
and report to the next Legislature.
It isi the privilelse of an itnelligetnt atnd

Amonigst the noblest examples of this ex
ereise of Legislative wvisdomn, stands the
splendid project of commui tnication with thle
wvest, over-leapinga the barr ier of the Blue
-Ridge. Cost what it may, Souath Carolina
must achieve this work. Socially. coma
meicially, piolitical ly juaterested as alhe is
in the cemientationa of soutthiern initerests,
shte betrays herself if, she allows a dotubt to
hang over its sucecess, or lags irresolute

Following in the samo spirit of doleste.
improvtment which you have wisey led,
I venture to suggest to yout consideration
a measure for the develolineilft of-du re
sources which does ito appear'o have-oden
so much appreciated by us, as by 6th~er
States of equal intelligence. Extensiveg'e
Ological surveys have been instituted 'under
legislative sanction, in most of the Now
England States, in Neiv York, Peniisyl
vania, and Virginia. Besides the contribu
tion to science, the direct advantages of,
these investigations have been so obvious
as to diminish the expense, by comparison,
i:o almost nothing. The mineral reson
ces of each section of couitry have been
brought to light, and made available.
Allmes oh buried wealth, of every deserip
tion, have been explored. their qualities
ascertained, and their uses pointed out.
'he oxhausted soil of lower Virginia has
found ant elixir of new lire in her long neg
lected bed, of lime and marl. Eved ite
gianite rocks of Massachusetts have been
classed, and each variety examined, and
precisely located. Thu fruit of this en,
lightened labour is seen in the blocks of
masonry which have been brought over a
thousand Miles ofocean, to adorn evem ihe
streets of Charleston. But as I propose
rather to advise with you, than to direct
your counsels, I leave this bare sugges
tion to your better intelligence. I will
only retiark, that the survey instituted
Some years sice, under the charge:of
Professor Van Uxem, was rather nineral
ogical than of a general geological chirac
tef: and therefore tended rather to eiiWr
tam the curious, than to enlighten-the iteps
of practical inustry. .
t. pon the generl Condition of ourlon
mon highways, it is hardly necessary. i
remark. That it connot psibly be TUech
worse, is I believe generally ucknoMie
god. Our road laws are very amperTict
ly enforced, and the system appears to be
very imperfect in itself. The ueil
distribution of the labour, the unskil 'il.
ness of the superinteudents, and the mini
fest interest of all who are subject to 'ad
duty to do as little of it as possible, ar' e
fects very sufficient to account for itsriis
erable-success. But as the Legi
has tore.than once exprespod its
naiznatt.attenmpt any geterata
this miatter,.1 will only suggest the-pe*i
eiy of encouraging the organization, ofrpri
vate Turnpike Companies, as well by the
grant of liberal charters. as by particilim
timng im their expenses and profits, in such
proportious as to secure their active co-op
eration. 0l
The condition of our navigable water
courses naturally suggests itself in this
connection. Large sumis have i)eem ex
piended in thteir~ itmprov'nemnt, but hereto
fore wvithoumt an adequate returni-perhaps,
because the system was not vigorouisly fol
low~ed up, rather thant from havinig hbeen
mjudieioutsl y contmmenced. Th'le Broad
R iven is a pirominenit illustration of this
one of our streamisof the largest class, di
vi(ding the centre of the State. Between
the Columtbia Camnal and Lockhart's Shoal,
and thence .o te mtouith of King's Creek,
in York District, there are several rapids,
at low water ilmpraiclicaible for the stnallest
craft, and at amll times dhillicutlt and danger
ous. A good deal of labour lias already
been expiend(ed tiponi these obstructimons;
bitt from thme erectioni of'Njiams, and the
casual disturbance of tile bed of tihe stream
admded to the imnperfectionis of thme original
work, the navigation is becoming annutally
more dillicult. This instance hase been
brought mnore especmally untder umy obsur
vatiomn thtan others, but the case is proba
bly the samte with the rest. To enable the
Legislature to ajmpply an adequate remedy
to this evil, it wvill perhaops be advisable
to cause this anid such oilier of our rivers
as demmand it, to be sutrveyedl by compe
tent agents, w'ho will report the estimtated
expense raid panrtieability of eachm work.
'hiero are mny subjects conniected with
the criminal comie which earnestly lenimand
the attention of the Legislature. A mong
thee, is the thbit of wearing concealed
iendly wenpons, which is become too
eommnon among the moore unthinking art
of the commmity. This ptractice is high
ly repirehtensible, ofiutesive to good taste,
stubversiv'e of the peace of time country, andt
unwvomthy of an advanceed stage of chris
tian civiliaation. Rev~enge and resent
Iment are bad counsellors tinder any cir
stances, or for anty rage; but whlen they
r)per'ate on yothfuil inexperience, the'y
have a peculiarnly baneful amnd mischievous
efTect. To carry secret wveapons for on
utnarmied adversary, to be usedl on an anti
eipatd occasion, is butt to arm revenge;
~ad to provid e them against a casual emuer
zency, ms to aiTord a temptahtioni to resent
meat. Thue transient ebtullimion of palssion
thus frequetly results in the commission
if irreparable crime. This vtuhgar* and
unmnly practice should niot otnly be dis
yonnttentaced, as it is bty the virtuous part of
society, but it should in some way bo ini
tibitedl by legal enacelmenits. It wvould not
)frhanps lhe proper to prohibtit the wearing
>f wveapons abuttmt tihe person. Snech a baw
