Agricultual
We copy the following from an article
be headed -" Farming in North Carolina," in
the American Agriculturist.
ir .TlManuring and Ditchinzg.-Tho appli
cation of compost maiure, formed.on the
ground io be cultivated, by a mixture o
G. swamp muck, stable manure, sod from ihe
id woodland, and about two bushels-of'lithe
- to the acre, with attention to hill side ditch.
- iag, bas enabled me to raise&fron 36 to
s, 40 bushels of Indian eoan on land before
'too poor for any c.-p. In'another experi.
ment.J;he success.has far exceeded the ex
n peitatiui of the most hanguine; 'thei was
ie on a flat piece of land, covered most of the
1 year with *ater, and with a heivy growth
C. of bamboo, [briars] where it was dry
e enough, with weeds, iron wood, and other
noxious shrubs and plants. This was
t, cleared up, and ditched abott *five feet
e deep ;'at the bottom of the diich the hard
pan of blue or white clay was perforated
with an augur, or occasionally cut through
with the spade.; rocks [stones) were put
in the bottom,. and carefully covered .with
split timber and then the ditches filled up,
Tbey-were entirely dry when finshed, but
- sliortly after ,they .were completed there
d was a fall of rain, when the ditches began
;- to discharge a ,considerable quantity of
1 water, and have ever since. made good
running streams. The ground haslbecome
P light, loose, and friable, and has yielded
about 75 bushels, 15 barrels or enrii to the
acre. For the labor in cutting the ditches
n I have been more than remunerated in thie
- quantity of muck (or more properly speak
a ing, clay) furnished for compost beds, with
I which the poor hill sides have been ma
nured. When dug up, this clay was ex.
tremely hard, forming the pan* on. which
the water bad rested and was not unlike
bItrick when taket from the mould.' In
four loads of this clay I alternately added
one load of good manure, until the com
. post reached from 50 to 100 loads. This
was done in summer, or early in the fall
and suffered to remain in the heap until
spring, when it was applied to corn land.
May not the fertilizing quality of this com
post have arisen from the entire disinteg
ration of the clay by the frost ? And was
not its capacity to collect and retain am
I 6ui a groat advdcate of atmospheric
manure, and have come to the conclusion,
that utm.ophere is the matrix of all ma
nure ; and that no other manure is valna
ble only as it is auxiliary to the attnos
phere. This may at first view appear to
be a starling and dangerous doctrine; it
would-certainly be so..if carried to the ex
tent bat Jethro Tull did, that is, that all
o;her manures were to be excluded. I am
in favor of giving every aid to atmosphere
in our power, by all allkalies, composts,
tanb such fixed balts as will impart to the
earth the' greatest possible capacity to
drink in and retain the gasses best suited
to its support.
in the compost beds referred io, there
were a few bushels of ashes put in with
the swamp earth, but so mixed as not to
come in contact with the stable mauure
the object was for the ashes to exert their
full intluence on ;he muck. They would
not have been injurious to the stable ma
uure,.for I find that in my cow yard it is
beneficial to throw a few bushels of wood
ashes over the litter occasionally; to fix the
salts confined in the urine, and tail ma
nure. Thirty wagon loads of rich swatrp
mud, put up in heaps in the fall, with the
addition of two bushels of caustic lime, is
found to be valuable for the reclamation
of a sandy land resting on a clay subsoil.
'The latter description of compost was ap
plied to sandy lanid, too far from my house
to add any stable matture, and with extra
ordinary effect, producing about thesame
-result that-the first mentioned cotmpost did
"on the clay land, viz. 36 to 40 bushels of
corn to the acre where the land had been
wvora out.
In connexion with this subject, hill-side
ditching must not be disregarded. It is
- perhaps mnore important to us, than in
your climate. The heavy rains of sutm
mer have done great injury to the s'oil. of
d the itshern $tates, by worktng off the
g most valuable of the hills, and draining the
lI botton1 land; this Is effectually guarded
[. agatnst by laying oft' the land judiciously,
m- and ditching. It has the effect o~f protect
a ing both the 'upland and bottom, by pre
venting the 'flow of water during hard rains
on the latter, and the washing or wasting
of the former.
Sir John Sinclair, has, by his perseve
rance in the cause of agriculture, done
more for this country than half the politi
cians and military tmen of his age One
te great secret of his success is, his attention
.y draining the land well,'and then protecting
, it by hill-side ditches, or what he calls
(. water- furrows, carrying all the excess of
a. water into his ditches and ponds.
In the second volume of Mr. Ruffin's
Svaluable work on agriculture, the Far
k miers' Register, I find that the application
n of leached ashes with htalf its quantity of
plaster of Paris, has had a fine effect when
put in the corn bill. Can you inform me
whether a mixture of carbonate of lime
would not be equally salutary ? As a
manure I should think it preferable ; hut,
as a food for the plant, or what is properly
e termed alimentary manure, it may not be
- equal to the plaster (a). The slovenly
t- practice of manuring in the hill, ought
.never to be resorted to by any farmer whio
Shas a regard for his estate and reputation
it seems to me too much of the miser and
nsurer. (h)

(a) Whe;ther lime or. plaster would be
mos befit6cial, must depend on the na.
ture of the sbil, and the crop to be raised
from it.
(b) Sp 'ding the tranure broad cast
should be enerallv followed. in addition
to this, it 4s considered eood practice to
manure ligitly in the hill around the plant,
just befoe it 'commences fruiting. Que
must be gided by circumstances some
what in these matters.
(C) We:jhink our correspondent should
make oth trials before condemning plas
retnLenet t-1 sown ia urysweatner, its
effecis will not become apparent in some
time; if in wet weather, almost immedi
ately. It is found that an ordinary crop
of these grasses usually contains from 1&
to 2 cwt. of this salt per acre. To such
crops the application of plaster must be
beneficial. To other crops, such as peas,
beans, wheat, oats, barley, it is of little
service t because upon -analysis, scarce a
trace of plaster can be fo6nd in them.
Perhaps the soil where Mr. Burton ap
plied. the plaster to the grass was exhaust
ed of its potash; ifso, it would lie of no
material benefit to the grass. See this
explained, page 225 of our last volume.

IMPROVEMENT.
Mr. Editor:-It having been my mis
fortune to own poor land, and to be.with
out money to improve it, I was much
cheered at the fqllowiug caption of an ar
ticle .whicla-ppeared in the last number
of the Southern Plantei, to-wit: " How
Poor Men may Make Poor Land Rich.'
This struck me as being-the desideratum
at which I bad so long aimed. I'therefore,
read the article with avidity; but lo! my
spirit quailed when I found lime and plaster
- indispensable." - It is true your corres
poindent has suggested an economical way
to obtain these articles under circum3tan
cos ; hut suppose I am located in a neigh
harbood w'here there are no oyster-shells
or. oyvter houses, and without money to
buy plaster; I am barred these benefizs.
Permit me, therefore, to euggest a course,
which is better calculated to attain the end
proposed by your correspondent.: Thes
teife and Lie necessary farming implements
being obnined, to put his land (the poor
man's) itngnod arable condition., let him
pilant his corn in well pulserizedl earth,
and go tohis-ash-batnks an'd piles of horse
manure. and take therefrom a quantity
sufficient to drop in each corn-hill, one
quaert (a jint of leached ashes wvill suffice)
so long as his manure lasts, and wrk'his
corn withiut reference to the alpplication
of manun', and my wvord. for it,,he, will im
prove doible the quantity offitnd and make
double tha .quantity of corn that he would
have dort had he have applied his mnanui
broad-cat ; and I have little doubt but
that the souble quantity of land thus ma
nured wil yield 'more wheat ; for from my
experimett in this way, 1 find the meauure
difiused nrough the beds to an extent that
tno otne ecn conceive, who has not experi
mented ii this way. The second crop the
beds willhec reversed, and the same course
pursued~by which a more general diffu
siotn of nanure will take place. I am
fully persuaded that the small qluantily of
manure -ecommended in this article will
double tis quanitity of grain that a broad
cast appication of the isame would, and
leave theland better eve~y, year.

that the high, bokl, and independe.at poli'

to his senses. -He finds that he cannot
afford to quarrel with. ihis country, and
aruiliigly assents that we should go on in
creasing our territory to our hearts content.
iteintd of flying into a passion and talk

extend and perpetuate the most friendly

has actually, made.. a- moiement for-the

legesnb.a Mr. Broadseiaow for theoman
ufacmure of steel;.
Ii is. made (says the Compiler,) on a
new .plan, f6' which Mr. Broadmeadow
received a patent in Jone last for the
wholeq- United States,. for fourteen years.
The saving iti this process is so great, dnd
the minerals in this State so well suited
for the pnrpose, that there seems no doubt
that the iron ores of this Siatb, when con
verted- into steel, will be transported to
Europe and sold at a profit in the English
market; that now supplies the whole world
'and.the United States made independent
from her own resources. The quality of
steel rmade on this plan has given such
satisfadion in New York that one house
has given a written order for two tons per
day.
A -Wise Bird.-A caitain of a vessel
iad a canary which was much attached
to him, and w ould perch on his hand or
head. One day the captain had several
friends to dine with him; the cage door
was opened, and the bilds after flying
round the room, perched on the head of
the captain. The party were then drink
ing wine, and he held up his glass, when
the hird hopped on the edge of it, and
.drank some of the wine. The little crea
tnre soon felt the effects, and returned to
the cage completely intoxicated. Soon
after, at another party, ihe captain-at
temipted the same, but the bird remem
bering what he had suffered before, would
not taste, but flew back to his cage.' Oh!
that, we were as wise as birds.-Prestan

From Tampico-A friend of ours has
kindly permitted us to m-ake the following
extracts of a letter recently received from
Tampico. They are under date of Feb.
22d, as follows :- .
-The revolution in this country is far
from being at.an end-in fact we consider
it as not 'yet fairly commanced; and in a
very short time you may expect to hear.
of bloody work. -We have merely got rid
of one tyrant to make room for legions.
" We had a Conducta arrige here a d
days since bringing about two -and a half ~.
miillions of dollars, the greater, part of.
which is now being shipped on board of
an English tman-o f-war,- bound for .Ja
maica."--[Mobile AderiLtaer, Mar'ch 18.
P2u'motion of Printers.-Pennsylvania
appears to placesa high estimation'on the
services- of. printers, who are always ini the
line of promo'ion. -Gen. Cameron, the -
new Senator from that State served a reg
ular apprenticeship to the business. There
are also aeven printers in rte field i'n'Phil
adelphia, as candidates for Alderthen, at
the - approaching election. ' aving all
worked laboriously at dif'er eases, they
will be able to distribte justie with pa.'
tience. and neirer be "otit of sorts."
