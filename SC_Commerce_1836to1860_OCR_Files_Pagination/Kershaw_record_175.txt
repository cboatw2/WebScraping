public, at the earnest solicitation of a number of
Kntlemen of long and high standing in the proision.
It m hoped, as a preliminary step, to
check the evils and fatal conseque ces arising
flrom the use of the numetoua deleterious nostrums
foisted upon the public by the aid of fabricated ,
proofs of miraculous cures, and other frauds, by a
set of mercenary, unprincidled pretenders, "So totally
ignorant ot medical science that it is impossible
the monstrous delusion can any longer go
down with the intelligent people of this counlrv.
These pills, mild ana agreeable in their nature,
should be kept in every family in cases of sudden !
illness, for by their prompt administration, chole
ra, cramps, spasms, fevers, and other alarming
complaints, -which too often prove fatal, may be
speedily cured or prevented. In fact, all those
who value good health shonld never be without
thein. They are sold in packets, at 50 cents, tM

PATENT COTTON CilN.
HIS Gin can be made double, or single. If
made double, they reduce labor, and gin just
A 1.I-. .t ' ....
iKiuuif, uir4uuiiuijrui conon over inc single cylinder
Gin. ho oilier knd having been in use picvous
10 this patent; and whether single or double, they
are found to improve the quality of the cotton, by
more perfectly cleaning it. They can be made to
contain from 20 to lGOsaws in a stand, and whether
small or large, one 'hartd will be sufficient to attend
them. The Gins have mechanical feeders and
hoppers attached to them, which free the cotton
from leaves, trash, dirt, &c. before it can reach the
saws, and by the thorough hackling operation it
receives from the feeders, which make two revolutions
to one of the saws, it is almost in a half
gined state, before it descends to the saw By a
vpry simple arrangement of a screw to each set of
gaates, on which the hoppers rest, and through
which the tepth of the feeders pass, th#y can be
made to teed slow or fast to suit the condition of
the cotton at the time. When made double, the
saws are placed on two sets of cylinders and turn
upon each other in opposite directions, and are
cleansed by two sets of brushes that have four revolutions
to one of twe saw. The two cylinders can
be detached so as to enable the plknter to run brie
or both at pleasure, although embraced with feeders,
&c. in one stand. The whole is put in operation
with a drum and band, as in the ordinary Gin, and
may be propelled by horse, steam, dr water power.
It inay also be propelled by iron running gear.
The force required to work it, is about the same as
that necessary to move an equal number of saws in
the common Gin. This Gin has been put in
operation in New Orleans for two or three weeks,
ana its success tested m the presence of 'a large
number of planters, merchants and others, and
received their {general approbation
Several gentlemen have been so kind as to give
the Patentee their written opinion respecting the
merits of the Gin. A number of others could be
added, but the following are deemed sufficient:
I From his Excellency Gov. White of Louisiana..
New Orleans, Feb. 27, 1837.
Dr. A. Jones?Sir, In replv to your enquiry,
what I think of your improved Cotton Gin, I have
to say, that 1 saw it work on Saturday the 25th inst.
nnd was very much pleased with its performance.
The mere fact of its self-feeding, seems to me to
be a very valuable improvement; and besides, the
quality of the cotton, as it comes out of the process,
appeared to me to be better and oleaner than
from the common Gins in use, and that it saves
considerably in labor. Respectfully, &c.
E. D. WHITE. .
From Mr J. Cotnpton, a Wealthy planter, resident
in the Parish of Rapide, Louisiana.
Dr. Jones?Dear Sir, I have examined your Patent
Cotton Oin, with feeders, &c. And have
seen it in operation, and approve of it so highly,
that 1 have taken the liberty of ordering one for
my plantation in time for the next crop.
Yours respectfully. J. COMPTON.

I Dr; A. Jones?Dear Sir, in feply to your note,
.accompanied by a specimen of the cotton, ginned'!
by your Patent Gin, 1 beg leave to observe, that it
| exhibits a decided improvement on the usual process
of ginning; delivering tlie staple Uninjured
and free tVom nap or trash, clean and of good color';
thereby giving the article on additional value.
TheCe favorable impressions of the advantoges of
your Patent Gin, have been confirmed by subsequently
witnessing it in operation. The utility of
the double cylinders and saving of labor, will be
readily perceived and properly appreciated by the
Intelligent planter.
Peeling a deep interest in the fuccr** of nil improvements
tenaing to benefit the important staples
of our country, 1 trust that yours will meet with
the encouragement it justly merits.
Very respectfully, your ob't serv't,

From Mr. G. Senior, a Machinist of New Orleans.
Dr. A. Jones?Dear Sir, in answer tc your inquiry
of my opinion of your Patent Cotton Gin, I
beg leave to state, that 1 was fifteen years engaged
in the cotton factories of Manchester, England,
and during, fdu'r years of tlmt thne, 1 was
foreman in the house of Messrs. Lewis, Williams
& Co., and near five years spinner in the houEe of
I Messrs. Sandford & Greene. I have 6cen your
' Cotton Gin in operation, and have exa'mined the
! cotton ginned by it,'and pronounce it better cleansed,
and the staple less injured, than any coltcn
| that ever came under my observatio'n. It is com|-f>letely
ready for the breaker without the aid of'lhe
blower, and would, therefore,'save the first process
I in manufacturing the article. 1 consider cotton
cleansed by your Gin, would command from one
to two cents on the pound more than the average
crops brought into tjic Manchester market, and
cleansed by common Gins. Yours, very res'p'ly.

i J have to state, that I have been engaged in put-!
ting up the Carver Gins for planters on lied River,
.and that I have.seen ypur Gin in operation, and

Gins: in addition to which, 1 think your feeders
a decided improvement, and by the aid of
which, the quulity of the cotton cleansed appears
much improved, over that produced by the common
Gins. Yours Sic. S. BENNETT.

planting States, at the above prices, the agents
paying the freight on the same from New York,
and becoming responsible for !he amount of the Gin.
It is desirirole, when planters give orders for Gins,
me; biiouju accompany them with their views in
'regard to the arrangement of saws, breasts, brushes,
&c. It is found they differ in opinion. Soir.e
desire saws of larger diameter than others. The
moat common size is 9 or 10 inches; but some wish
them 12 incites. Some wish 5 or C rows of brushes
on an axle, while others do not want jn?r? than 4
at most. Some wish sown with ft or ft tooth to tU?
inch, while other* want 10 or II. With *o roach
discrepancy, we prefer tbey>?hou1d, at the time of
giving ordera, furnish a statement of their wishes,
and tne nianufacturerers can fulfil them in every
particular. Where it is left to out discretion, we
shall make them on the most modern and approved
{?lan. An order can be cxecuted.from the time it
s received, in the space of eight or nine weekn
and the Gin in that time placed in the hands of the
factor To be in time for tha.next crop, all orders
.ought to be in the hands of the manufacturers by
the first or middle of May; except for plantations
where they are late in commencing to pick or gin
cotton.
