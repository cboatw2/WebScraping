Never lias a more atrocious mutiny than the one .
narrated in the following extracts been brought to 1
j el
light in time to avert its direlul consequences, and {
to crush it by prompt and vigorous action ; and i
never, perhaps, since the days of the Buccaneers .
has such a bloody scheme of indiscriminate and j ^
wholesale murder been devised and matured. The .
timely development of this horrible plan of outrage 1,
upon humanity was inost providential: had it been j ^
permitted to take eftcct, what disgrace must have ^
ensued tothcAnicr.can flag. and what incalculable s
.miseries to thousands of innocent individuals tra- ! f
versing that 4'great high-way of nations"?the i a
ocean ! The prompt and summary execution of t
the ringleaders was doubtless the only means of ar- j a
resting the progress of the conspiracy, as any at- a
tempt to bring them home, merely for the purpose x
of going through the form of a trial, must have
been attended with fearful risk to the vessel and s
ali on board who remained faithful lo the honor j
of their country's flag. Lieut. Mackenzie is gc- j j

MlTIXY AND PlMSIIMENT BY DkaTII ON j
the United .States Man-of-Wak Somf.is.?On j
Wednesday the United States brig Somers, comm
inded by Lieutenant S.'idell .Mackenzie, arrived jj
at tills port Some obscure rumors of a mutiny ^
on board of this vessel, of the punishment of the c
principal mutineers, by immediate execution, and s
of a considerable number of her crew being brought i {
home in irons, begun immediately to circulate.? c
These rumors have now assumed the shape of cer. I j.
taiu information and disclose a murderous conspi- !

racy oil the part of some ot t.'ie suson-maic 0:11- ; ^
com anil the crow, t!u: detection of w-rich, was ! j
followed by hanging three ol' the ..njwaders at the
yard-arm. { j
On the lltli of November, the Som-rs saiicd j a
from Liberia, and on the voyage touched, in or- 11
dcrtotakc in water, at St. Thomas, which she ^
left 011 the 5th of December, iler employment on j j(
tbc African coast, had been to protect the Ameri- | ,,
can merchant vessels from detention by British j c
cruisers. She carries ten guns, and liad on board J )
at>out a hundred persons, of whom a considerable s;
number were apprentice boys. u
It appears th it, before leaving the African a
coast, a conspiracy had been formed among the jj
crew t?o take possession of the vess I, an J turn her i j
ioto a pirate shin. It was agreed that nothing ; c
should be done until the Somen* had taken in wa- j ^
ter ut St. Thomas, ami that, when the vessel was ! ,
again at sea, the mutineers should rise and kill j (j
the captain, the principal officers, ami ail who .
were not in the conspiracy, except the surgeon.? J j
After this, they wove to proceed towards the har- ' t.
bor of New Vork, capture some of the packets j ,j
bound to that port, which it was supposed would j
have sj?ccic on board, ami after plundering them, : jj
and murdering every p rson o:i board, to prevent j (j
their doings fro n being publislied, wail in the i
Somers, which is one of the swiftest vessels in our i ^
fcjrvico, for some distant sea. a1

of the mutiny arc from the Courier ?.J- E..<ju:rcr, \ y

44 A day or two previous to Dec. 1st, and when lj,r
the vessel was within about .> or G'JJ tuiles of St. 1 p,
Thomas, Midshipman Spencer hinted a pari, of ^
his plans to Mr. Wales, the purser's steward, who jj
alFe "t'.'d a hearty co operation, took an oath of so
secrecy, A. which Spencer administered to l.i.n, ;i;
when he w is made more fully acqu unied with | j;
the plan of the mutineers.
44 They had arranged to raise a scuffle on the
forecastle some night after leaving St. Thomas, ;1!
while the deck was in charge of Midshipman j
lingers. a nephew of the late Com. John leaders;; ; y,
and when the men engaged in it would of course tj
be ordered aft to account lbr the cause of the (its. i 0i
turbancc, and Mr. Rogers was thus engaged, tlicy
were to seize, gag and throw him overboard, with , jj,
as little noise as [?ossibla. Spencer wis then to i ]j
cuter the cabin and kill ('apt. Mackenzie; and | sothers
were appointed to be stationed at the main i a|
hatch, through which the crew must pass to get ^
on deck, and at the steerage hatch, through which j (j
all the officers except the captain mu.->t p uss. All y
the officers, except the surgeon were to be mur. j
dercd an J thrown ovcrlmrd; and the crew, who u
were below, were to be mustered on deck. The ! 0]
two after guns were to be jK>iutid forward, to so- ! ff
cure the mutineers from an attack, and such of ' sj
the crew as had not yet joined, but who then chose u
to come in with them, wok to be admitted, while j u
the otliers were to be thrown overboard. j,
44 They were then to get out all the boats and
lighten the vessel; after which they were to make fl
for the Isle of Pines, where they were to meet a ?
confederate. They were then to cruise in search C!
of merchant vessels trading between this port arid
Europe, which, after being plundered, and the u
males on board killed, were to be indiscriminately t(
sunk; and if there chanced to be any females, ]
they were to be taken on board the Soincrs, viola-1 |,
ted, and retained so long as the pirates might dc- [
sire, when they also wore to "oe committed to the ; u
deep! The arrangements for the division of the (j
spo.ls, the allotment of the femalis, the various : (j
offices 0:1 board, &.c. were all completed, and w
drawn up in detail, in Spencer's hand-writing, and j j,he
assured .Air. Wales that he bad twenty of the j 0
crew with him sure. j c
44 From the moment Spencer made the a!?ovo ,
circumstances known to -Mr. Wales, he was J j,
watched with argus ryes by Samuc. Cromwell, 0
boatsw ain's mate, and Eiisha Small, seamen, who ?
were the principal ringleaders with Sp- ncer, and 0
who threatened to throw him overboard, the mo- ,r
j *3
incnt they saw the least signs of defection in him, c
or had the least cause to suspect that he had made, j p
^ or intended to make, any disclosure to any per- s
son. | tl
" Mr. Wales, not daring to communicate with f(
C'apt. .Mackenzie, made all the circumstances, us J c
detailed by Midshipman Spencer, known to the J c
purser, who promptly conveyed the intelligence |
to ('apt. Mackenzie, when measures were irnme. j ;;
diately taken to ascertain the truth of the ease.? f
Spencer's papers were thereupon examined, and ; j
all the details of their plans, as narrated by Wales, t
were fully conlirmed. Spencer, Cromwell and !
Small were then secured, and ell hands being v
mustered on deck, Capt. Mackenzie addressed a
them on the subject of the proposed mutiny, ap. J 'j
prising them that all the pi ins of the mutineers h id j v
been discovered tud frustrated. \T.v?inyth*ni p
,f the co::? qucncc of any similar attempt.
"Captain .Mackenzie then addressed a circular
ctter to each of the oiiieers on board the vessel,
xcept the acting midshipmen, requesting their
pmion as to the course of conduct which should
>e pursued toward Spencer, and the two men who
tad been arrested with him. Each one returned
n answer that they deserved immediate death,
nd Captain Mackenzie's opinion coinciding with
hat of his olliecrs, it was determined to carry the
nmishmcnt into immediate execution. All hands
vcre accordingly called to witness the punisliment.
A'hips were rove into each end of the fore yard
inn, and one on the inner part of the yard. The
trisoners were then brought on deck and informed
>f the punishment about to be executed upon
hem. Small at once fully confessed his fault,
uid asked most penitently the forgiveness of his
:o.mnandcr and the otficcrs, which was at once
iccordcd by them. He then obtained permission
o address the crew, which he did, warning them
iorainst permitting themselves ever to be seduced
is he had been into the committal of the crime for
vhich he was about to suffer death.
44 Spencer asked a respite of 10 minutes for himelf
and companions in guilt, that they might piv>arc
to die. This was granted, and he was asked
f he wished to write to his father or mother, but he
cplicd that he did not. lie acknowledged his
ruilt and tiic justice of his punishment, and renarked
that he would rather meet such a death
here (at sea,) than to be subjected to the infamy
of exposure on shore. The ten minutes asked for
y Spe ncer were extended to upward of one hour,
icarly the whole of which time was employed by
lim in endeavoringtoobtain forgivcnncssof Small,
or having seduced him into the committal of a
rime which he was scpn to expiate with his life.
Jmall withheld his forgiveness for a length of
ime; but at last in reply to Spencer's oft-reiteratd
request of44 Do forgive me, Small,*' he said that
c fully pardoned him.
4 Every tiling being in readiness the noose was
laced arou.id the neck of each of the culprits, and
lie officers were stationed about the decks to see
every man had both hands on the ropes.?
Ibt.ut 1 o'clock, p-ou time,) on the Ist Dee., the
igual was given by firing a gun to leeward, and
he guilty men were run up.
44After hanging about an hour, the bodies were
nvcred down and delivered to their several mess,
latcs to be laid out and sewed up ; and in the
veiling they were committed to the deep, C'apt.
lackenzie reading the service usual on the occaion
of burials at sej. Small's last words wore to j
ivoke a b!es-i ig on the American flag, and to
sk forgiveness for having so dishonored it; but
ic othcis died without any marks of penitence, j
tiuucdiutely after the execution, all hands were
ailed to cheer ship, and three hearty cheers were
iven for the Am ric.ni flag, which was then wavig
at the gaff, after which all hands were piped
own and the usual duties of the ship were resumed.
4' Four of the men, who appeared to be most dcep'
implicated, were placed in irons immediately
pan the discovery of the projected mutiny; bat

to go to duty until they reached t!i s port, when

"These are unquestionably the material facts at;i
ling this attempt to seize upon :t national ship,

ompt and just punishment of titc ringleaders.?
"h it adds greatly to the disgraceful character of
lis dangerousan.l daring attempt, is the fact, that
ir of the ojfircio of the ship devised and was at
ic head of the projected mutiny; and when we
rar in mind 111 it Spencer informed Wales that
c had a confederate at the Isle of Pine*, where the
omers had not been, and that his chief confedcr.
les, Cromwell and Small, shipped 0:1 l>oard after

oubt that the mutiny was arranged in this port
Uiat confirms this supposition is the fact now as.

that lie would never return to this city, and
11 the passage out assumed to be able to tell men's
> tunes, and assured his fellow-midshipmen in the
eerage that they had not long to live ; words
diicb at the time were treated as badinage, but
'Iiich were doubtless bused upon a knowledge ofj

"All the petty officer; who rcr.ninc 1 true to their

Oilicial accounts of the affair will probably soon
be made public.
Since the publication of the foregoing statements
j a communication lias appeared in the Madixonian, j
j signed 44 S," which will be readily regarded as
\ emanating from the Secretary of War. It boldj
ly denounces the infliction of the summary pun;
ishment as an act ot injustiJiable cruelty, and as
! having proceeded from a degree of alarm unwarranted
by the circumstances of the ease. Though
our previous extracts have been so long, it is but
fair that the vindicators and friends of the culprits
! should be heard, and therefore, we extract the following
from the communication :?
I
I 44 An awful responsibility rests on those officers, I
, and above all on their commander. Without the )
least desire to render that responsibility more lm |
: ardotis than it now is, it is still deemed an act of I
simple and bare justice to the memory of the si tin,
to say that an examination of the papers transmittcd
by Commander .Mackenzie show these
facts:
441st. That Acting Midshipman Spencer, was
put in double irons on the 2otu of November, and
the Boatswain s mate, Samuel Cromwell, and seaman
Elisha Small on the day following, on a
I charge of intended mutiny.
442d. TMt no disorder of a mutinous character
j appeared among the crew for the four succeeding
J days that the vessel was going with good breezes
and in good weather towards the island of St.
j Thomas, where she actually arrived and took in
| supplies on some day between the 1st and 5th of
t - k
X/UCliiJIAi
"3J. That, on the 30th of November, the cpin,
ion of the oftlcoj'J was required by Commander
j Mackenzie as to tiic disposuipn of t,n? prisoners t
I that they appear to have examined thirteen sea- j
men as witnesses to prove the alleged mutiny, (and |
who arc therefore supposed' nnoccnt of any purtiei- j
pation in it,) which examination was had, so far |
as the papers show, m the ahsence of the prisoners, J
and without giving them any opportunity to cross- j
examine the witnesses or to make any cxplana.
j lions or defence, or to procure any testimony in
. their own behalf. These officers, without even
the form of a court, without the obligation of an
oath, and upon this ex parte secret information,
united in the opinion that the safety of the vessel
required that tho prisoners should be put to death!
How far ibis recommendation was influenced by
the acts or the fears of .Mr. Mackenzie docs not
appear.
" 4th. That on the 1st of December, when every
tiling add person on board the vessel were perfectly
quiet after four dajs of entire security, the
three persons were, by the order of Mackenzie
hung at the yard-arm at mid-day.
"The allegation, in some of the papers, that it
was proved to have b?en the intention of the inu- j
lincers to execute their project on arriving at St.'
Thomas, is wholly destitute of any evidence. And
had it l.Jen their design, it was effectually frustrated
so f.ir as these prisoners were concerned, by
their confinement. At St. Thomas, any of them
.might have been left, and thcjiowcrof the officers
of the vessel strengthened to any cxteut that
was necessary.
" The onlv account we have given by Spcnctr
himself, is, that it was all a juke. If it shall appear
to have been the more romance of a heedless
boy amusing himself, it is true, in a dangerous
manner, but still devoid of such inu.dcrous designs
as are imputed, and if the execution of him and
two seamen, (against one of whom, at least, there
is not yet a particle of cvid(ncc) should prove to
have been the result of unmanly fear or of a despotic
temper, and wholly unnecessary at the time to repressor
prevent a mutiny?if aii tins rati appear,
it cannot bo doubted that Ine laws will be vindicated."
A DDtTIONA T. P.vaTICl'LAItS.
From the N. Y. ('j/n. Advertiser.
Spencer, when told that he must die, at first
gave no sign of yielding, but after a time his firmness
gave way and he made a full concession of
li s guilt, acknowledging the justice of his doom.
From his own confession it was ascertained
that, while on board the John Adams, on the coast
of Brazil, and subsequently when sent home, on
board the frigate Potomac, he had entertained in
both vessels a determination to excite a mutiny,
for the purpose of turning pirate. The plan on '
board the Somers was originated and had made
some progress before leaving the harbor of New
York.
It is said that Spencer asked lo be permitted to
fire the gun, which was the signal for execution? !
but when the trying moment c.mc, another was
obliged to fire the gun. j

l>y the allegation, said to have been m:id< In
.Spencer, that lie had a confederate at the is!. <.i
Pines. A writer in the sun conjectures that the
confederate is to be looked for in the Texan war-1
schooner San Antonio, which lias bc-n missing
I since sonic time in October; but of this there is
lit tic probability.
The astounding devclopmentof this mutiny gives
importance to an incident which, at the time, we
did not think worth mentioning. Some two or
j three weeks ago, just as our paper was going to
press, two persons, having the appearance of military
men, came into the publication office and inquired
whether we had received any account of
the loss of the Somers; saying that they had
1 heard such a rcjwrt at the barge office, whither it
J had come from the Custom Iiouse.
We immediately sent a messenger to the Cus;
toin Iiouse and to other quarters in which such
j information might be loo' cd for, if true, but we
i could not learn that the report had been received,
or even heard of. By the following paragraph
I from the Albany Journal it sceins that the rumor
I was heard of tnire also :
j " About two weeks since the rumor was rife in
j this city that the U. S. brig Somers had foundered
! at sea, and that all on board were lost. This rui
inor was based upon a letter received in New York
j by a merchant vessel from St. Thomas, in which
I it was mentioned that the Somers had been caught
in a tremendous gale and had suffered so much
; that she was hourly expected to go to the bottom.
It is now believed that the letter in question was j
i written by one of the mutineers on board the
j Joiners, in anticipation of the success of their
plot, ariil with a view of accounting for the ex!
pectcci " disappearance" of the bri^."

Postage or Luttf.rs.?The following: just and
sensible remarks on the present high rates of postage,
are from the Oswego Palladium :
"If the postage was reduced one half, we incline
to believe the Post Office revenue would be a
gainer. Under the present rates and the strong
arguments for economy, now so impressively felt j
correspondence is very much abridged, and c<erv
means of ssvmg is re sor led to. No
man in these days leaves a v.'fstcrn vclage for j
New York or Albany, without carrying h?m j
a respectable mail bag. If the postage (<3 tiljse i
cities from Buffalo, was only about six cents?
which is enough?we believe the Post Office
revenue would not be diminished and individuals
much less incommoded. The present Postmaster
(ioneral is disposed to execute the laws and rcgu
lations rigidly. lie is right. It is his duty to
have the laws executed, and they should he executed
or repealed. We always prefer to have had
laws rigorously executed. They arc more likely j
sooner to be removed from the statute book. It !
is said that improper means are resorted to, to
vadc the Post Otfice laws? that hints arc given
through newspapers, and double letters made to
look as modest and single as the demurest spinster.
This shews the public thinks itself imposed upon
by the pesent laws, and that these laws have corrup'ing
influences. People who make use of the |
post office establishment upon other terms than the j
government agrees for, arc smugglers on a small j
scale. As great oaks from little acorn3 grow?so j
do great rogues fiom little ones. It is immoral in j
the government to have laws, which disjiose peo- j
pie (in'the main honest) to cheat.
Latest from Laglyra?We learn from Cap- j
tain Peddle, of the brig Ann Eliza L., from La- '
guvra, reported under our marine head, that mar- I
kcts were dull for American produce when he left
there.
Captain P. also informs us that the brig Carracas.

authorities of that place, sailed thence on the 13th

Revolution is Peru.?We have received,
from an authentic source, the following particulars
respecting the revolution in Peru, which took
place in August last:
General Toirieo, supported by the military, deposed
President Menc-ndez, and took j?ossession of<
tnc Government, styling himself " Chief of the
Nation." This act o'" vicdencc was consummated
very quickly and quietly. There was no bloodshed,
no tumult, no resistance. Two or three
persons were arrested, but they were soon rolcased, i
and there have not been any expulsions, which is |
miIilp ovtmnnliniirv. So far. Torrico has aston- |
islied every body by his moderation. He has gone j
to the South with hi.-: army to put down General i
Vidal, who lias also proclaimed himself "Supreme '
Chief" at Cuzco. La Fuentc seems to have been
set aside by the southern army. The Government

tnovud that the memorial presented at the last ses-1 ,
sum by Washington Irving and others, on the ! 11
subject of u general copy right law, protecting the j
property of ail authors, should again be referred j
to the Committee on the Judiciary. This wasj;,
done. Mr. Cushing ollcrcd an amendment, s
which was adopted, instructing the Committee' h
to inquire into the expediency of amending gen?rally
the existing copy right law.
The booksellers, who have hitherto flourished s
by the republicatipn of other men's works, for i
which they paid ribthing, now find themselves,! \
much to their chagrin, undersold and supplanted \
by the newspaper publishers. This fins converted j
them from enemies to friends of the extension of
the copy right. What the authors, who have no
great skill in managing, could not do, the booksellers
who arc men of business, will probably cf"
" * a. : 11
feet, and the change in the copy rigni law wui i
now probably be made by Congress.?N. Y. Ev. j
