re-eharter it?*what was the consequence?
the same then as now, a pressure and a
suspension of spece payments by many
of the Banks. In 1816, in order to ex- 1
tricate the eodntry from its pecuniary)
difficulties, and compel'the local Banks
to resume payment; Congress chartered
the second United States' Bank, and whati
was the result?within a few months,)
there was a. genera! resumption of specie
payments. And during the continuation

with tho best currency in the world, as
declared by a committee of the Senate in
1830. But the charter has expired, and
what is our situation, the answer is at
'hand, worse, far worse than if possible
than in 181 i?a universul suspension of
our Banks, and a depreciated currency:
does not these circumstances point to a
National Bank as the remedy, and, if an ,
evil, as a necessary one. It seems to me, ,
that I could not come to a different con- j
elusion, without shutting my eyes to all {
the lights of past experience. But a I
word as to Its constitutionality; their is
no express grant': while as an implied '
power, it may be constitutional. 1 hare
always inclined to a strict construction,
but necessity^! consider, is above all law.
I therefore advocate a Bank, believing as I
honestly do, that it is the only measure
that can relieve the distress, and gi~e us
any thing like a guarantee of a sound and
uniform currency. And in a spirit of
compromise, I say to "An Old Farmer,"
that I am not wedded to Nicholas Bidille's
Bank, or any other, if that be aristocrats
cal, abandon it to its fate, and let Congress
give us one based on republican principles.
I would say a Peoples Bank.
" An Old Farmer" further says, "when
the government receives nothing for its
dues but the legal currency, it will check
in a degree, the inordinate issue of the
States rag monej." I am sorry to differ
here again,^ suppose he means gold and
silver, by the legal currency. Yes, the
specie circular has done the business for
us. It closed all the Banks in the couti.

BANKS AND BANKING.?JTbere is a very
interesting article on this subject in the las nuinber
of the " Southern Literary Journal," from the '
pen of Dr. Coofkr. The Doctor it seems haa i
been converted to a United Slates Bank man. It 1
will be in the tecolleotion Ttf all our readers, that sJ
some short time since, he was violently opposed J
u> a united b tales Bank, ^denouncing it not only 1
aa unconstitutional but inexpedient. Recent events <
have, however, convinced him of his error on this
head, .and be baa candidly acknowledged it.
In tine article alluded to in the laat " Literary '
Journal/' there are a variety of intereating facta,
and much valuable statistical information, but they |
are commingled with 'some curious and absurd '
speculations. Doctor Coorfcn ia certainly a very j
learned and wise man, but hia effort on " Ranks
and Banking/' convinces ua that this is one of
those subjects upon which he is at fault, and Which
he does not oomprehend.
.Our limits would not permit us, (even if we felt
the disposition, which we do not,) to review the
entire article; but his answer to the following
question struck us as being so ridiculous, that we
could not avoid alluding to it. The Doctor after
proving that it is impossible for us to get on with*
out Banks and a convertible paper currency, and
proving also that it is essentially necessary to have
" a National Bank, to serve as a regulator of the
motions of the great commercial machine/.' asks
the question to which we referred above, viz.
t?n _ "
- it run precautions seem necessary in licensing
State Banks f In replying to thia question he men*
tions eight particulars which he conceives import*
ant: we have not room for all of them and shall
t
therefore notice but two or three. He says, " paper
issues never to be more than two and a half times
the amount of cash" (coin we suppose) " absolutely
in the vaults." 44 Never permit a director
to borrow from the Bank in bis own name, or by
any contrivance in using another name. Pay your
Directors from $1000 to $2000 a year. Quite
enough for an hour's work once a week." 44 No
Bank to go into 0|>eratioif till its whole capital
be paid in, and one third of that capital in
coin."
These 4'precautions" of the Doctor, together?
with some others, we consider absurd and ridicu*.
lous. If they were engrafted on our ,Bank Char-'
ters, it would, in our opinion, as utterly destroy*
thru, as any other method that could be proposed.
Who would ever be a stockholder iu a bank, the
charter of which contained such provisions?
.. Let us examine the subject for a moment. We
will suppose a Bank with a capital of $500,000 00,
one third of which^ust be in sperie in its vaults.
Of the capital there will remain $333,330.00 for
oBiiKing purpose?, ine D&nK noi .Deing allowed !
to issue "more than two and a half times the cash '
absolutely in the vaults," the same being $106,667,
00, eould not issue notes to a greater amount than
$4l6/>67,00. Tie consequence ^eould be that the j
greatest amount that the Bank could ever have at j
interest would be $750,000,00. This at G per >
cent, Bank interest, would prodice annually!
$45,000,00. The expense, according to Dr. '
Cooper would be for Directors, usually thirteen,
say $2000 per annum, $26,000,00. Officers salaries,
other than Dijectora, say $8000. House
rent, atatufhary, fuel Ac., $2000,00 more; making
the entire expenditure $36*000,00; so that the
Stockholders on an investment of $500,000,00,
v ould divide annually about $9,000,00 a little lees
than 2 per cent on the investment
Who would own Bank Stock under such circumstances
as these? Or could any better plan (
be suggested to destroy all the Banks, than to I
adopt Dr. Cooler's idea? 1
MR. VAN BUREN, it is said has demanded of
Great Britain the release of Mr. Greely, now '
11
in the jail of Fredericton, New Brunswick. Mr. j
Greely's confinement grew out of some question i
in relation to the disputed boundary. 1

RAIL ROAD ACCIDENT.?A most distressing
iccident occurred on the Postsmouth and Roanoke
Hail Road on the 4th inst, by which three young <
adies were instantly killed, and thirty or forty j

t U thought will not survive. "The accident 8
>ccurred from the conoussion caused by two trains j

Coroner's inquest which was held over the deceas- I
?d young ladies, was that their death was caused ^
ly the gross negligence of the conductors of one i j

TO PRINTERS.
E. White & Wm. Hagcr,
RESPECTFULLY inform the Printers of the
United States, to whom they have been individually
known as established letter founders,
that they have now formed a co-partnership in
laid business, and an extensive experience, they
hope to be able to give satisfaction to all who may
favor them with their orders.
The introduction of machinery in place of the
tedious and unhealthy process of casting type by
band, a desideratum by the European foundtfa,
was by American ingenuity, a heavy expenditme
of time and money on the part of our senior partner,
first successfully accomplished. Extensive
use of the machine-cast letter has ftilly tested and
established its superiority in every particular, over
those oast by the old process.
The letter foundary business will hereafter be
carried on by the parties before named, under the
firm of White, Hager A Co. Their Specimen ex
dibits a oomplete series, from Diamond to Sixtyfour
Line* t'ica. The Booh ind Rewi type hieing
in the most modern style.
WHITE. HAGER & Co. are agents for the
sale of the Smith and Rust Ptinting Presses, with
which they can furnish their customers at manufacturers*
prices; Chases, eases, composing qticks,

SUPPLEMENT TO THE GLOBE.
PROSPECTUS
FOR THE
CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE A*D APPENDIX.
Sensible of the deep interest which must be felt
:hroughout the Union in the peoceedings of a new
Congress, convoked by the new administration, to
neet the extraordinary emergencies which have
irisen since the close of General Jackson's term of
lervice, the undersigned have already made pre pa ions
to furnish their annual report in the form of
i Congressional Globe. As these successive pubications
comprise a full and faithful r? cord of all
hat is done in Congress?sketches of the Attend*
nt discussions, with an Appendix containing the I
inished speeches prepared by the members themelves?they
are suited not only to gratify the
uriosity of the hour, to inform the distant c >nstitency
of the part performed by their immediate
epresentatives, and of the result of the labors ol
ill; but, we donbt not, they will be found perma-tenlly
useful as the most authentic, complete, and
lonvenient parliamentary record of our times.
This undertaking h ving, with these views, been
iberally patronized by the public, it is our purpose
o justify this early and continued favor by inreasing
the strength of our corps of Reporters at
he next fall and winter Sessions. The Fall Sea.
ion will be looked to by the country to settle all
hat has been unsettled by the overthrow of the
vstein of Depositee as established by Congress?
ne overthrow of the currency as established by
be Constitution-^and the overthrow of the system
f revenue, both as a means of adequate supply
)r present demands, the maintenance of matinictures,
and the regulation of commerce. Every
bing of pecuniary interest to the Government
rid the nation will be involved in the discussions
f the next Congress; and it was because the Preident
would not have those all important subjects
;ft to Executive discretion & moment beyond the
ime when a fall Congress could be summoned,
bat the September session was convoked. The
lachinery of government, even when thrown out
f geer, must continue to work ; but when so disrdered,
its movement may be driven in a wrong
irection. The Representatives of the people are
lone competent to set all to rights. No Demoratic
Chief Magistrate would continue, in the
ondition of things at present existing, to substiute
Executive expedients for clearly defined la*
pringifrg from the public will.

first two sessions of the 25th Congress $2 00

25th Congress $2 00
