From the President of tie United State
to the two Houses or Congress. at th
commenceient of the Second Sessioi
of the Twenty-Sixth Congress.
Fellow Citizens of the Senate
and House of Representatires.
Our devout gratitude is due to the So
prene Being for haviug graciously conti
nued to our beloved country, through th
vicissitudes of another year, the iuvalua
*ble blessings of health, plenty and peace
Seldom has this faivored land been so ge
.aerally exempted from the ravages of dis
ease, or the labor of uhe hu-ianclmoan mor<
-amply re'varded; and never before havc
our relations with other countries hee1
placed on a more favorable basis that
that which they so happily occupy at thie
critical conjuncture in tile affairs of the
-wurld. A rigid and persevering absti
nence from all interference with the do
mestic and political -relatione or Other
States, alike due to the geniu and dis
tinctive character of our Government, ant
to the principles by which it is directed;
a faithful observance, in the managemeal
of our foreign relations, of the practice o1
speaking plainly, dealing justly, and re
quiring truth and justice in retutru, as the
-best conservatives of the peace of ntliors,
a strict impartiality in our manifestaltio
of' friendship, in the commercial privilegei
we concede, and those we require fronu
others these, accompanied by a dispobi
tion b, prompt to maintain, im every ener
gency, ouir own rights, as we are froni
rinciple ave' to the invasio t of those o|
others, have gjvesi to our couintry and Gov.
erninent a etanding ,:- the greait fanily ol
altions of which we halV jtust cause to 1)
proud, and the advant.'ges of which ar
experienced by our citizenS ;hIroughott
every portiot of tie earth to which the.
enterprisimg and adventurous spirit m:y
carry them. Few, if any, remain insensi
ble to the value of our friendship, or igno
rant of the terms on which it cant be ae
quired, and by which it alone can be pre
served.
A series of questions of long standing,
difficult iu their adjustimeti. and inportantt
in their consequences, in which the ri!hi
of our citizens and the honor of the country
were deeply involved, lave, in the course
of a few yars, (the mIost of him durin!
the succeekful ,jdminist ratioin of iny mnnie

facetory cotnclusion tiantd the mtost impiort

believe, in a fair way of being speedib
andt satisfactorily adinusted.

Sincee your iadjouritnment, nothing w.rit
.has occutrred to atterrUptl or treatetis ih
.siraile .bairmnony. f (!toutS have lua r
aboive the uothe.r hemnispberti, they have nio
cast their portemious shdionmW tin Ott
happy shores. Bound by nto en:nra ihg al
liances, yet linked by a commnon itutr
and interest with t'e othierntations of mit.u
kind, our aspirations are for the preservam
tioni of peace, in wvhioe solid and civilizin
triumphs all mtay participate with ai gene
rous enindationt. Yet it behooves u-atn b.
prepared foir any eveit, and to be alway
ready in maintain thtose jtust arid enlight
ene'd principles of nattural intercoutrse, fat
which this Government lhas ever cont-end
ed. In the shock of contemding emnpires
it is only biy assuming a resc lute hearmtit
and chothintg thtemtselves with defensiv
armor, that ntetutrail nations c:tn mt:iittai
their indetpendeni rithtts.
The excitement whieb grew out of th
territoirial controversy between th.- Unite
States and Great liiin. hnving in
great measutre subsidled, it is hopedl tlam,
favorable period is ai~pronaht tor ts 11
nail settlemnent. Both Governmtents moa
now be coiivinced of the' udangers wit
w hich the quiestion is fra-:ghr ; and it mmn
le their de,:ire, as it is their interest. th:
this perpettual cause of irritation should b
removed as speedily as pratcticable. I
mny last annual miessne~e you were imforrr
edl, that the proposition for o commtinion' i
epllorattiont anti survey promiised by Gre;
Britain hand bteen re-ceis ed, ati that a cour

.th. certain nd flmal adjust ment of the lin
whole extent of the boundary north tlong (
the Western hank of the Sabine river, from s
its entrance into the Gilf of Mexico to the
thirty-second degree of north latitude.
The commission adjourned ont the 16th of
June last, t.a reassemble on the Ist No.
vember, ihr the purp'aoe if esta llishing aC
curately the intersection or the thirty-se- i
cond degree or latitude with tihe western t
hank of the Sabvino nd merediano line
thence to) Raed River. It is prequied that i
the work will be concluded inl the present
season.
The present sound condition of i heir Ii- I
nances, and the spece;s with which em
harrassmtents in regurti to them, at times
apparently insurmimnbialle. have been
overcome. are matters upon which the
people and Government of the United I
States may well congratuiate theimsel es.
An overilowing Treaeury, however it may
he regairded as ,an evidence of plttic pros- ,
periy, i -eldom conducive to the perma- I I
nent welfaireo tany people ; andl experi- 11
enee has demontrated its incompatiilitv I f
with the saintaarv acaion of politieni insti- a
ttions like those of the United Sttics.- n
Our safest reliance for fintucial efficiency a
uni inlepeadenoc., has. oil the contrary, s
heen1 found to consist ina ample resonrees :
unencumbered with debi ; andl in this re
specet, the Federal Government occupies a o
singularly fortunate antd ti uly enviable po- i
sition. I)
When I entered upon the discharge of s
ty official duties in March, 1837, the act Ii
for the distribution of the surplus revenue it
was in a course of rapid exection. Nearly a
twenty-eight millions of dollars of the putb- di
lie auottics were, in pursunce of its pro- b
visions, deposited with the States in the r
iontis of Jantary. April, nnc: July, of c
thait year. itn .I:y, there occurred a gen- h
cral suspension of specie payment by the tu
bank, including with very few exceptions, pi
those itn which the public monies were de- w
posited, and upoa whose fidelity the Gov- w
ernment had unfirtately made itself de- t<
pendent for the revenues which had been In
collected fron the people, nnd were indis- th
pensaile to the public service. This sus- sc
pension, and the excess in hanking and it
commerce! out of which it arose. anti h
which were greatly aggravated by its oc- sa
currence, made, t a great exteut, una- sc
vqiilable the principal part of' the public n
money then oi hand ; suspended the col- d
leetion or many miltions accruind on maer- li:
chants' honds; and greatly reduced the a(
revenne arieing fr'otm customns ald the pub- ti
1hsudtis. Tftetae' e-tvtt - ltsYo.ov ItI.m-net to t1t
operate, it varionas deerces, to the present at
peril; atd, itn -iddit min to tle decreas in di
the revenne thus produced, two and a half re
millions of duties have been relinquished it
by two biennial redtctions under the act of* w
1833. ani probably ats mnuch more upon el
the importation of iron for rail roads, by lt
speciai legislation. sc
Whilst such has been our condition for I
the last four years int relation to revenue, sc
we have, during the same periid, beeni i
subjected to an anavoidabale contiuaince of' of'
large extraordinary expeinse4 neces.4arily a

The sudden and rapid distribution of the i
large surplus then in the Treasury. and
the equally sudden and unprecedenttedly
severe revulsion inl the commerce and lin
biness of the country, pointing with uner

propriety of til earliest practicable reduc
fion of tit public expenditures.
But, to change it systemp operating upon
