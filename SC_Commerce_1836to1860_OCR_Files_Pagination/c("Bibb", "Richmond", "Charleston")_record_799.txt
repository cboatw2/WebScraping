society. Whether it teat right or wrong, was a
matter the church had not to decide, as it belonged
i# political government, and Christ’s kingdom was
not of this world, nor was it any part of its business,
to change or alter institutions of Cesar, but benefit
all men living under them. There is another case
mentioned in scripture worthy of particular notice;
and that is the case of Philemon and Onesimus.
The latter was found by St. Paul a runaway slave
at Rome, and was converted to Christianity and
sent back by the Apostle to Philemon his master.
That Onesimus was a slave is clear, and that the
gospel found him as such, is equally clear; and
that it did not interfere with the relations of master
and slave any farther than to form the union again,
by tending him back to his master, is also clear; and
from all we find in the scriptures mentioned of this
institution, it was one that the gospel found among
other political and civil relations of society, and
belonging to civil governments. But whatevei1
might have been the facts as found in the New
Testament in regard to this institution, it is clear,
that the Methodist Episcopal Church in the United
States found it existing here when its first minis
ters came with the Gospel, to offer life and salvation
to all classes of society, and found it as a part and
parcel of their governments, authorised by law, in
their articles of State Constitutions; and universally
recognized as one of their civil and political institu
tions. But it is most clear that from the New
Testament there can be found no warrant to meddle
with this subject; and that to do it, is anti-apostoli
cal. Tin nature of our Lord’s kingdom forbade
his apostles to interfere with the institutions of
government, as his was not of this world, but was
from above, and “ pure and peaceable, and gentle
and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good
fruits, without partiality and without hypocrisy,”
bringing its blessings to all conditions of men, ruler
and subject, master and slave, irrespective of polit.
ical relations. Christ would heal the master and
his servant without breaking or altering their rela
tions, or condemning them. It is no where found
in the New Testament that to change the relation
of master by freeing a servant or slave, was made a
condition of church membership; nor that any rela
tions that existed among men as relations of gov
ernment disqualified them for holding office in
the Christian church; but it is most clear that these
relations were recognised by the apostles, and that
they were not condemned. Now it was certainly as
much the duty of St. Paul and St. Peter, and the
rest of the apostles, to condemn slavery, and make
that a condition of church membership, and of the ,
ordinations to offices in the church, if they consid
ered it an evil, and such an evil as the church could
interfere with, or was accountable for,to have laid down
laws, and enacted rules to have abolished it, as it
could be of any set of ministers afterwards. The
church was receiving her model and pattern under
inspiration, in the conduct and precepts of these
men ; and there is not one instance in which they
ever condemned this thing, as it existed in the va
rious states in which they preached and established
churches, and ordained “Deacons and Elders or
Bishops according to the wants of the church.”
In many of the instances which we have referred
to, it is plain that the Church did not establish this
relation, (and evil if it be one,) but that it belonged
to the institutions of State governments, as found
by the apostles, in visiting various states and
raising churches in them, and that they did not
trouble these relations, but recognized them, either
as being right, or as matters with which the church
had nothing to do. This is plainly inferable, too,
from their enjoining of the duties growing out
of such relations upon each party. “ Servants
obey your own masters according to the flesh,”
and for masters to render unto them what was
due, forbearing to threaten, or to punish them.—
Now St. Paul did not say to the servants that this
bondage was against religion, and that it was un
just and their masters had no proper right over
them. This would have made them disobedient
and discontented. Nor did he say to the masters
that if you do not free your servants, you will be
damned and excommunicated from the Church.—
If the thing was an evil in itself neither the church
nor the master might have been liable for it. Now,
whatever might have been the private opinion of the
apostles, as to what was the best mode of govern
ment, and the most Christian institutions among the
governments of earth, we cannot infer from what
they said or did, for their business was far above
it; nor did their religion allow them to meddle with
these tilings. One o( the most clear evidences that
the apostles did not legislate upon, nor try in any
way, to break up or alter the relation of master
and slave, is found in the case of Philemon and
Onesimus, before mentioned; the former, an
opulent master and Christian of Colosse, and the
latter, one of his slaves who had eloped from his
master, and was found at Rome by St. Paul, under
whose preaching, he was awakened and converted
to God ; who, under the influence of religion, felt
the wrong he had done to his master, and truth and
honesty claimed that he should make known his
condition, that he was a slave, and had run away
from his master who lived at Colosse, and who was
a Christian. But St. Paul sent him back, with a
letter of intercession to Philemon, to forgive him
and restore him to his confidence, as he was now a
Christian and could be trusted, and would not so
treat his master again. Here was not only no in
terference by St Paul with the subject of slavery,
but a positive reunion of master and slave in send
ing him home, effected by the Apostle. He did
not say to Philemon, that it was a moral wrong for
him to own Onesimus, and that he would go to
hell if he did not free him, or be excluded from
the communion of the Christian church ; nor that,
because he owned and held slaves, he should not
be elected as a deacon, elder or bishop. It is be
lieved, that Philemon was a Christian Bishop at
Colosse. There is no certain evidence of this, but
there is the clearest evidence from all apostolical
usage and precept, that the fact of his owning of
slaves, did not disqualify him for such an office.
Nor is there any warrant from Scripture, to bar the
door of the Christian church against any man on
this ground, or prevent him from holding any
office in it. Hence, for the Christian church to
legislate upon this subject, and condemn any part of
their brethren, because the political government
under which they live, may have the institution of
slavery connected with it, and may differ with their
own, is wide of all apostolical rule, or scripture
warrant. It is a right the church never had, and
whenever she assumes it, it must and will end in
her disparagement if not her ruin. Let the things
of Caesar take care of themselves. It is true, that
members of the church and the ministry may
have and vindicate their political opinions, and con
tend for proper civil institutions as suhjects of gov
ernment. But whenever they take these opinions
into church councils, they step aside from all rule
and right, and lay the foundation for the church’s
ruin, by creating a war between the church, and the
powers that be, which they are commanded to be
subject to. I, perhaps, have extended this article
too long for any one to take as much interest in
reading it, ae I have felt in writing it. In my next, I
ahall endeavour to show, that all that the church has
done in meddling with this subject, has been pro
ductive of harm and not good. Justice.
Georgia, October, 1843.

SOUTHERN BISHOPS.
The article on this subject, copied in another
column from the Southern Christian Advocate, is in
tended to show the opinions of a distinguished
Southern, minister upon a subject of very serious,
and very general interest. The opinions of Dr.
Capers are entitled to weight, and we have great
respect for them; but we differ with him on the
general topic of his article as to the probably re
quired number of the Bishops. Certainly the vene
rable men now at the head of our Episcopacy are
required as a sacrifice to the demands of our never
standing-still-itinerancy. Even now the three
junior Bishops have the most of the work to do;
and unless the Episcopacy be increased in 1844
they may be thoroughly superannuated before 1848.
But to our apprehension we need Bishops for other
and not less important purposes than to preside
over the Conferences, and in the stationing room.
We need the concentration, to some extent at least,
of that influence which is now spread over the
Church at large. Not a dioces an Episcopacy, but
an Episcopacy still itinerant, and exercising a gene
ral superintendence, but nevertheless, not shooting
through the circle so rapidly as not to be seen, nor
so remotely as not to be felt. We want Bishops
not always in the Conference, nor on the wing, but
possessed of sufficient leisure to allow their worth
and weight of character to be witnessed and felt by
persons and in places remote from the highway of
official travelling. We want Bishops in some sort
for the people, and not solely for the ministers.
We need at least three more Bishop’s; and one of
them ought to be South of the Potomac. So we
think.
GENERAL INTELLIGENCE.
FOREIGN.
State of Spain.—The existing Government of
Spain, or rather the men who call themselves Min
isters, appear to be fast approaching the last stage
of confessed incompetency. In Barcelona, their
Captain-General is cooped up in his own citadel,
and their most efficient leader draws back from the
contest. The counter-revolution spreads. They
dare not let Madrid know what Barcelona is doing;
but having as long as possible suppressed the news,
they strive to garble it when it must be told.—
Plots against them are formed on every side. In
that predicament, it is supposed that they are about
to ask for foreign intervention! On what plea1
Unless paramount and dominant by their own
strength, they are nothing. They are not appoint
ed by any public body or party ; even the half
municipal revolutionary body that gave them a kind
of appointment, the Junta of Barcelona, has revok
ed the grant. The Cortes, which can alone deter
mine wi'h some show of authority, has not met.
A speedier mode of authenticating their pretensions
would be afforded by a National Convention, or, as
it is called in Spain, a Central Junta; but that they
do their best to prevent. They have not even
clearly established their title as a de facto govern
ment; for their authority is disputed by their own
countrymen, and they are but partially successful
in maintaining the contest. They are nothing but
a party of officers who mutinied, have broken into
the public offices, and contrive at present to remain
there: but what pretext have they for asking any
foreign government to force the country to keep
them there 7 They seem indeed scarcely to trust
to their own project; for they now ask the Spanish
people, instead of having a Central Junta, to wait
for the meeting of the Cortes; and they ask it at a
time and in a manner as if the people were not very
likely to comply.—Spectator.
Science in RussiA.-The Autocrat of Russia does
not neglect the encouragement of science—espe
cially, it appears when it offers practical advantages
to his possessions. Mr. Murchison has been en
gaged this spring and summer in an examination of
Poland and the Carpathian mountains, in order to
the publication of a work on the geology of Russia.
On his return to England, he found that the Empcr- ]
or, who had already conferred upon him the decora- j
tion of Sl Anno in diamonds, had further acknowl
edged his services to Russian geology by two hand
some presents. One is a colossal vase, of Hyaline
quartz (Avanturine) upon a pedestal of porphyry ;
both materials extracted from the Altaic moun
tains, and wrought at Kolyvan. The vase bcar
the following legend, inscribed by means of gal
vanism on the base—“Gratia Imperatoiis totius
Russia; Roderico Murchison, geo login; Russia; ex
ploratory 18-13.” The other present is a plateau
of watered damask steel, wrought at Slataust in
the Ural mountains, with gold ornaments in relief,
representing the chief mining operations of those
parts, and bearing, in Russian, this inscription—
1“ To the geologist Mutchison, in testimony of its
peculiar esteem, by the Administration of the Mines
; of Russia.”
!
Turkey.—Letters from Constantinople of the 8th,
state, that the greatest activity prevailed in the
military departments of the Porte, and that on the
6th instant a hatti sheriff had been passed, which
incorporates the militia with the regular army for a
period of five years. Redschid Pacha, President of
the Military Council, had been appointed Seraskier,
or General in Chief, of the troops in Roumelia,
with the title of Muschir, and was to reside at
Adrianople, where a camp of from 28,000 to 30,000
men were expected to winter. The Porte seems
disposed to afford France full satisfaction for the
insult offered to her consul at Jerusalem.
Italy.—Letters from Modena of the 25th, give
some particulars of the troubles now taking place
in several parts of Italy. They state that an anon
ymous proclamation had been circulated in all the
principal towns in Italy, calling on the people to
throw off the yoke of tyranny, and Btating that
some of the principal nobility were ready to put
themselves at the head of the movement. Several
pamphlets of the same nature printed at Marseilles
and Malta have been also put surreptitiously into
circulation. The Austrian garrisons of Itovigo and
Verona have received considerable reinforcements.
New South Wales.—Sydney papers of June
1st, have been brought by the Arachne, and put
ashore at Falmouth, on Saturday. The colony of
New South Wales may now be considered to have
passed the preliminary stage of its social existence,
and is ere this time entered on another, which, at
no very remote period, may be pregnant with im
portant consequences. Under the new constitution
which has been conceded to the colony, the Gover
nor has issued the writs for the election of mem
bers to the Legislative Council, and all was bustle
and excitement, preparing for the contest. From
this time forward the colony assumes the power of
taxing itself; and, as the oldest of our settlements
in the Australian group, much will depend for good
or for evil on the discretion and judgment with
which the new power is exercised by the popular
branch of the legislative body.
Comical Conference.—The Chinese Commis
sioners entertained Sir Henry Pottingerat Nankin
prior to a settlement of the terms of peace. “Nu
merous parties,” says Captain Loch, “of minced
meat, pork, arrowroot vermicelli soup with meat in
it, pigs’ ear soup, and other strange dishes, were
served in succession, in small china and silver ba
sins ; and in proportion to our various capabilities in
making these messes disappear, we seemed to rise
in the estimation of the beholders. But human na
ture could not support this ordeal long; and, as a
coup de grace, Ke-Ying (uncle of the Emperor)
insisted upon Sir Henry opening his mouth while
he, with great dexterity, shot into it several immense
sugar plums. I shall never forget Sir Henry’s face
of determined resignation after he found remon
strance of no avail; nor the figure of Ke-Ying as
he stood before him in the attitude of a short-sighted
oid lady threading a needle, poising the bonne louche
between his finger and thumb, preparatory' to his
successful throw.”
Late from Hayti.—We are indebted to the
kindness of Captain Lofland, of the brig Vesper,
which arrived at this port yesterday from Jacmel
(St. Domingo,) for some interesting intelligence
from that Island. Captain L. sailed on the 1st in
stant.
The recent rebellion had been totally suppressed,
and the country remained quiet. The new Consti
tution has been secured, and a number of dele
gates were assembling at Port au Prince, from va
rious parts of the Island, with-a view to electing a
President of the Republic. Their choice, it was
supposed, would fall upon a citizen who is repre
sented as being extremely popular, and therefore
likely to secure the future tranquillity of the coun
try. His name, however, had unfortunately escap
ed Capt. L.’s recollection.—Philadelphia, Oct. 24.
Late and Important from Yucatan.—Captain
Beasson, of the scluyArgus, 18 days from Laguna,
arrived yesterday, reports that when he left La
guna active preparations had been for some time
making, and hostilities were about to be recom
menced between Mexico and Yucatan. The latest
accounts received at Laguna from Vera Cruz stated
that there was no probability of the Yucatan Com
missioners coming to any amicable understanding
with the Mexican government. We may now
look for a renewal of the desultory, indecisive,
powder-wasting and climate-destroying warfare
that made up almost the sum total of the reports
irorn that country during its recent invasion by the
redoubtable troops of Mexico.—N. O. Tropic, Oc
tober 25.
Business Abroad.—Gentlemen who returned in
the steamer Acadia, and have been travelling in
England and on the continent, speak of the stale
of bussines as every where exceedingly prosperous.
DOMESTIC.
[Reported Tor the Southern Christian Advocate.]
Statement of the Charleston Cotton Market.
October 31,1843.
For some days past we have had but little inquiry for
Cotton. To-day however, a better feeling seems to ex
hibit itself, and buyers have turned out very generally.
Favourable accounts from New York may have created
a brisker demand with us: sales have been made this day
at 7 1-8 and 8 cents for good middling, and fair Cottons.
We quote as extreme from 6 to 8 cents.
The State vs. Samuel Lamb.—This was an
indictment for the murder of a slave in St. Johns
Berkley. The indictment contained two counts,
both for wilful murder. The prisoner was arraign
ed on Friday last; the whole day was taken up in
the examination of witnesses. On Saturday morn
ing, W. C. Ferrell, Esq. addressed the Jury in be
half of the prisoner; Henry Bailey, Esq. Attorney
General, followed for the prosecution, and C. B.
Northrop, Esq. replied in behalf of the prisoner.
The pleadings closed at 4 o’clock, P. M. The
Judge was near an hour in charging the Jury,—
they left their seats about 5 o’clock, and remained
in their room until yesterday (Monday) morning,
at 10 o’clock, when they came into Court with a
verdict of not guilty. The prisoner, on motion of
Counsel was discharged.—Mercury of Tuesday.
Loss of the Steamer Sarah Barnes.—The
schr. Galveston, Capt. Rickets, arrived at New
Orleans, October 25th, brought intelligence of the
loss of this vessel. The Sarah Barnes, on the 24tl>
September, crossed Galveston Bar for New Orleans.
On the next morning, the 25th, a considerable leak |
was discovered in her hold. All the pumps were j
set to work ; but they wore able to keep her free j
for a short time only. At 9 o’clock, A. M., when
about 75 miles from Galveston, it having been j
found that the water was gaining on the pumps and j
that both wind and sea were increasing, the Capt.
determined to run her on the nearest shore. At
half-past 2, P. M., the water, notwithstanding their
exertions, had ascended to the fires and the en
gine. They then set about making rafts of the
cotton bales,—four bales to a raft, and lashed to
gether some spars for other rafts. She was now
sinking rapidly: the lead was heaved, and there
were found six fathoms of water. There were on
board altogether thirty souls,—of these eighteen
went on the rafts and twelve took the boat. Of
the former, but five were saved, after drifting about i
three days and three nights. Two of them landed
on Galveston Island, and the other three on Boluvair
Point. Of the latter, but three perished,—who
were passengers, two males and a female,— ni l
they were lost in the breakers, in landing nomine
boat, on the 26th.
Saved.—A. G. Abell, bearer of despatches; B.
I’. Hartshorn ; F. I’inkard and servant; Charles
Cloud, mate ; Tombson Royle, clerk ; Mathews,
engineer; Steward, steward; Green, cabin boy;
Gorman, bar-keeper; Two dock hands and two
firemen.
Lost_Janies Potter ; II. S. Dagget, Judge Blair,
Mr. Boyd, Dr. Cosgrave, a female, unknown; 3
Deck Passengers, Charles Franklin, owner and
captain. -Dean, 2d. engineer; Alex. Jibell
Rook, 2 deck hands, 2 firemen.—Picayune.
The Extent of the United States.—A recent
publication in the National Intelligencer Iroin the
pen of William Darby, Esq., the Geographer, gives
the extent of the United States, according to the
following limits :
Commencing on Passamaquoddy Bay, at
the mouth of St. Croix river, and thence
along the Atlantic ocean to Florida
point, 1,800
Thence along the Gulf of Mexico to the
mouth of the Sabine, 1,100
From the mouth of the Sabine, in common
with the Spanish or Mexican provinces,
to the Pacific ocean, 2,300
Along the Pacific ocean from lat. 42 deg.
to 49 deg. N. or about, 500
Due E. from the Pacific ocean, on lat. 49
deg. N., on the Russian territories to
the Rocky or Chippewyan Mountains, 600
Thence in common with Cabotia, or Brit
ish North America, to the mouth of St.
Croix, 3,000
Having an entire outline of 9,300
The longest direct line which can be drawn over
this great region stretches from Cape Canaveral, in
East Florida, to the Northern Cape of Queen Char
lotte’s Island on Dixon’s entrance, 3214 statute
miles. Assuming this line as base, the mean
breadth is about 700 miles, and area in square sta
tute miles, in round numbers, 2,250,000.
New York.—Winter.—The Albany Evening
Journal of Monday says, “ Snow commenced fal
ling quite steadily about 10 o’clock last night and
continued until noon to-day. The air is raw, and
every thing wears a wintry look.”
At Troy the snow was four inches deep on Mon
day. Some twenty miles north of that place it was
six inches deep. There was also snow at Hudson
and New Haven on Sunday night.
New Orleans, OcL 21.—The city is as quies
cent as Smyrna during the plague. News there is
none, and business is beginning merely to yawn
and stretch its huge limbs, as though preparing to
spring from its sleepy couch. Cotton is beginning
to stir a little. For the past week our receipts have
been something like 20,000 bales, and our sales
about one-third that amount.—Corresporulence of
the Mobile Tribune.
Mobile, Oct. 23.—Yesterday we had a smart
shower in the morning which cooled the atmosphere
to a comfortable temperature. As yet, however,
there is no indication of a settled change of weath
er, until which we can neither hope for a frost nor
a return of health. There seems to be no increase
of fever since our last. The number of interments
is the best criterion of the health of the city.—
Tribune.
We leam from the Wetumpka Argus that there
was a heavy frost in that region last week. It did
some injury to the cotton on the lands contiguous to
the river. In the vicinity of Montgomery there
have also been several frosts. At Tuscaloosa there
was a frost on the 12th instant—Ibid.
The sickness in the interior seems to be without
abatement. The Tuscaloosa Monitor publishes
nearly a half a column of deaths in the various
parts of the state.—Ibid.
Burning of Bane Notes.—It is officially an
nounced in the Tuscaloosa Flag, that $3,124,240
of the circulation of the State Bank of Alabama,
and the Huntsville, Decatur, and Mobile Branches,
had been burnt,—making an aggregate, including
the amount burnt in June last, of five millions six
hundred and forty thonsand one hundred and thir
teen dollars of circulation destroyed since the ad
journment of the Legislature. With such a rapid
redemption, and destruction of surplus circulation,
the editor rcmnrks that the currency must in a
short time appreciate to its par or specie value.
Missionary Tour.—The Rev. Dr. Anderson,
Senior Serrelary of the American Board of For
eign Missions, is expected to sail from this country
in the rotirse of a few days, for the purpose of
visiting the stations of the Board in Greece, Syria,
and adjacent regions. His tour may be extended
farther if circumstances should seem to demand
it.. Those who are acquainted with the peculiar
situation of the missions in that part of the world,
will appreciate the urgent necessity that exists for
this important journey of observation.
The Fire Yet Burning.—It is now three
months since the great fire in this place, and yet
the fire in some parts of the burnt district is still
burning. We yesterday, in passing the ruins of
the Pocasset House, noticed that the fire was burn
ing among the rubbish of a wholesale grocery
store, which had been kept in the basement of that
once splendid building. There was a large quantity
of corn, meat, and other articles buried deep be
neath the ruins, which in this smothered state con
tinue still to burn.—Fall River Monitor.
.New Lamp for Railroads and Steamboats.
*—There has been exhibited in Washington, a newly
invented lantern for railroads and steamboats, which
will prevent accidents by night upon railroads and
rivers, by showing objects at a great distance ahead.
The light is thrown by a simple process in a large
ray directly upon the track, and at the distance of
ten rods ahead the smallest print can be read with
ease.
A Formidable Reptile.—The Savannah Re
publican says that a rattlesnake was killed on the
Augusta road, a few days since, which was six and
a half feet long, and four and a half inches in diam
eter. ft measured across the bead two inches and a
half, and had thirteen rattles and a button. Its
fangs were each about one and a half inches in
length.
Audubon.—The St. Louis Republican of the 18th
October, states that the steamer Lebanon, from the
Missouri river, passed Mr. Audubon in a “dugout,”
heavily freighted with the fruits of his adventure,
decending the Missouri below Lexington. He was
expected to arrive at St. Louis on the 20th.
Cure for Deafness.—It is said that by melting
sulphuric tether and ammonia, and allowing it to
stand fourteen days, a solution is formed, which if
properly applied to the internal ear, will remove, in
almost every case, this hitherto considered incurable
affection.
Employment for Mechanics.—There is much
animation at the navy yard in Charlestown, Massa
chusetts, at the present time, building, repairing,
and fitting up ships. Upwards of 600 men, princi
pally mechanics and laborers, are employed.
New Post Office—A Post Office has been
established in Edgefield District called Oakland,
on the road from Lexington C. II. to Waterloo,
Laurens, and Col. J. Huiet appointed Post Master.

PROSPECTUS.
OF THE
SOUTHERN QUARTERLY REVIEW.
In commencing tbe Fifth Volume of this publica
tion, the Editor wishes to urge, with earnestness,
its claims upon the patronage and support of the
Citizens of the South. Its circulation, always re
spectable, but never largo, requires to be, and, it is
believed, may be, much extended, and the work be
thus rendered a more efficient organ in maintaining
the rights and sustaining the literary reputation of
the Southern States. The discontinuance of other
periodicals, which have divided the public patron
age, renders the present time a peculiarly appropri
ate one for presenting such considerations as will
awaken a new interest in it, and for making such
efforts to extend its circulation as will place it on a
permanent basis.
It may be proper to state, briefly, the leading ob
jects which such a Periodical proposes to accom
plish, and also the reasons, which show the impor
tance and necessity of sustaining one with energy,
at the present time, at the South.
The general objects of such Periodicals are
pretty well understood. They serve to embody the
opinions of enlightened minds on all great questions
in which the interests of the arts, sciences, letters
and politics are involved, at certain periods in the
history of the country. Their aim is, not only to
review books, and, in the spirit of thorough and
impartial criticism, to decide upon their merits, but
also, in the performance of this duty, to discuss im
portant subjects in such a manner as to make deep
and permanent impressions upon the character of
the people and the destinies of the age; to diffuse
knowledge, not to foster prejudices; to create, di
rect and control, not to echo, opinions ; and finally,
to canvass principles and maintain truth in a calm
and dignified manner, and in a style chaste, lumi
hous, nervous and appropriate. The offspring of a
high state of civilization, they furnish evidence of
intellectual advancement, and are the object of a
just and honourable pride, regarded as the exponents
of the literary standing and character of communi
ties.
The importance of sustaining such a work at the
South, with ability and effect, is equally obvious.
The South, like the North, and the other sections of
the Union, owes a duty to the age and to the coun
try in behalf of her literature. She requires an
able and high-toned Periodical, that is fitted to nour
ish, and call into active exercise, the literary talent
of our Southern Commonwealths. But, more than
this, our institutions are peculiar, and require a dis
tinct organ through which they may be defended
with power and spirit, when assailed, as they often
are, by other sections of the American Confederacy.
This aggressive conduct on the part of our Coun
trymen, so prejudicial to the general harmony, re
quires to be met and repelled by argument, first, and
by action, if necessary, afterwards. The South is
an agricultural coantry, and her position is different
from that of other sections more particularly devoted
to commerce and manufactures. Iler views of her
peculiar interests should be known, and require to
be maintained and defended with ability, through
some such channel.
