The reduction of postage upon letters
is a subject which has engaged the public
attention for years, and is one of great
interest to the whole community.
It is contended by many, whose opin. j
ions are entitled to respectful considcra- ,
fion, that the reduction of postage would
give an increase of revenue. Without I
undertaking to discuss this question at ;
. present, I am not prepared, from the pre- 1
?cnt financial condition of the Depart- j
inent, to recommend u reduction of the (
rates of postage, as now figed by law, hut j
invite a modification of thegi so far as to
make them conform more generally to the j
smaller coin of the (Juitcd States, and ;
solicit a revision of the law* regulating j
the postage on new-papers. I do not de- J
sire that the rates of postage on newapn- j
per* proper phould be i?creawd. though !
much might lie saved to the department
if* the principle of pre postage was applied ,
to newspapers, provided such regulation j
was deemed acceptably to public opinion. ,
I must, however, earnestly invite your
^attention and hoj?e you will call that of*,:lN?ngress.
to the necessity of the enact. |
tflHlf of some law by wnich a ju*t dis- ,
crimination mav be made in the unposi- '
lion of postage on jiewspujiurs proper and
" those mammoth periodicals which assume J
shn:>e and nauie of newspapers, but ,
which are. in fact, the republication of ;
Imoks, reviews, and novels, sent through j
the po*t office, not always to subscribers, i
l?ul in large masses to agents, to vend in j
tie- markets of the more distant cities, <
towns, and villages, whicn greatly illk
i reuse the size and weight of tile mails
^ sod the expense of transportation, without
a corresponding remuneration to the ?
department. The great number of tiiese ;
Urge publications which have been sent
bv the mail from Baltimore to Wheeling i
has mainly coiilribuled to the frequent I
it regularities of the Western mails for;
the last twelve mouths. I re-pectfuliv
inquire whether it is just that the United
N.atea mail shall he compelled to trans, i
- J
p ?rt one o these papers, weighing nearly j
a pound, for a rent and a half, from Bos. |
* tun or Now York to Louisville. Ky? to a '
' Ucfcrir, to sell lor thebmofit of the publinher,
while the letter of friendship or of

have consented to attend, and a hope is
cherished that some arrangement, satisfactory
to all parties and beneficial to
the public, may vet he effected.
The improved mode of intercommunication
by railroad and steam, operating
under chartered rights granted by the
Slates, and over which it is not pretended
that the General Government, much less
the Post Office Department, can exercise
any control, imposes upon Congress, in
my opinion, new duties and obligations,
which can only be cancelled by the adoption
of some measure whereby the Post
OtBce Department may, upon adequate
>..! d/miirp l?v comnnet the
right to transport the mail in the cars of
railroad compan'es, and at the same
time give totlie Department the power
to'control the departure und arrival of tiie
same.
Tiie re is now paid to the different
railroad companies annually, over, #400,.
000 for the service, without pawer in the
Department to regit to le the travel, arrival,
and depnfture of the mail: and constant
and frequent difficulties, both in entering
into and the execution of contracts, are
presented.
It has ocrurod to me that the present
was a most favorable period for the a.
doption "r some measure hy Congress,
whereby to secure to the United States
the* right to transport the mail upon these
roads hi all time to coine, free of any an.
nual charge upon the Post office Departmeiit,
hy the advancement of a sum in
gross, which may he agreed upon, to each
rO' lliA^ioii,n;t!ini(>?t nr <11 ell nf them 3S
may be willing to contract.
Many of the railroad companies and
some of them constituting most important
links in the great chum of intercom tn-uuication
between Boston and Charleston,
owing to the great derangement of the
monetary concerns of the world, and the
depression of all State nnd company
stocks, find themselves laboring under
* u
eirihrrassmcnts and difficulties, which the
aid of the General Government, applied
in the way proposed, would effectually remove,
aad at the same time secure to the
United States the advantage and the ample
equivalent of transporting the mail
upon the roads.
The credit of the United States to an
amount not greater than the sum necessary
to produce, at five percent, interest,
the amount paid bv the Post Office Department
to these companies annually,
would, I have do doubt, lie sufficient to
accomplish this desirable end. The
prompt and favorable action of Congress
upon this subject at the present time
would effectually secure the government
against the danger of being called upon
for occasional and larg< appropriations,
to meet the balances due by the Departments
,
Do I ask the United States to do more
for the Post office Department than jus
lure would see in to demand, especially
when it is remembered that the whole ev
pense of the othci il eorrespnndenr.c of the
government and (ho public. and privartcorrespondence
of those entitled by law
(o (ho iVarik:n?? privilege, is sustained and
paid hy a lax iij?>n (ho correspondence ol
(ho orrtirniniiv ? If hv this arrangement
C
the Department is relieved from the heavy
annual charge: as now rated, (and it has
neither thej power to lessen it no to prevents
i's increase.) it may l>e Imped that tie
object so much d'MiMrtdeh hy considerations of
otibiic justice (that of r> dining the tax upon
the friendly hiu! business correspondence ol individual-)
will ho att -uned, and. at the sain"
mm, the usefulness ol the public mihi! great h
enlarged and extended to those portions of tin*
Uirou, hitherto denied the necessary mail laci'llies
If the Government was required to pay on*
taoe ujkiii ortiaal correspondence. and if tlm
franking privilege was abolished or reduced to
proper limits, liie revenue of the Department
would be increased to an aum ill sulficieni ot
iiM'll to pay the interes: upon the debt to he
incurred l>y the proposed arrangement, anil liquidate
the principal in loss than tlerty years.

In the act of Congress proposing a cession
of all right which ilie United States claimed
over said road, upon certain conditions, to the
States through which it passed, it was expressly
provided that no toll upon the Btaor
coaches, <2vc. conveying the United States
mail should be imposed. With this, a mono
other reservations and exceptions, the S ates
of d/aiyland, lVuiisylvaiiia, and Ohio, acc.ep.
ted the cession, and assumed the control over
so much of tin road as is wiitiiu their respective
