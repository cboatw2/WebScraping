f?%r, he dttermined to let that suffice f?>ra dressing
; and the effect of the highly impregnated
water from the yard was a growth of grass truly
astonishing. Both fields were kept in pasture,
and when the stock had eaten one of them down,
they were removed to the other, an 1 so changed
regularly about. But the effect of the different
crops on the appearance of the stock, horses an 1
cattle, is not to be expressed ; for while feeding on
tlic limed land their coats were close, shining, and
heultf^, and their spirits light and cheerful, when
they were obliged tolaborhard to obtain a belly-full;
hut when turned into the watered grass, six inches
or more in height, a difference for the worse could
he perceived in twenty-four hours, and every day
after they lost condition amidst the greatest abundance,
with coats rough and staring, lax in the
bowels and flaccid, with distended paunches, dejected
countenances, and sluggish in their movements.
But the transition to health and vigor
and good looks was quite as sudden and apparent
on a return to the' limed land. My friend adds,
ho never had an instance of the murrain or botts,
while his stock fed 0:1 these pastures, but is satisfied
he should have had both, but for the change
to the limed land.
In conclusion, I would ask, is it not fair to draw
the following deduction from what has been said,
namely, that all dairy pastures ought to l?c heavily
limed; it being the most natural thing in the world
to suppose that a proper secretion of milk, the best
and most wholesome, depends very much on the
nature of the food with which the animals are fed?
Ergo, lime your pastures, and allow your stock as
much salt as they will consume daily, for I am |
eorfvinced that lime and salt are a remedy for
" botts in horses," as well as the " murrain in cattle."?Far.

Amer. Agriculturist.
On the culture of Rice, from the pen of the late
Hugh Rose, Esq. being in answer to queries from I
the late William Washington, Esq., both of whom j
were most respectable Rice planters in the State of
South Carolina. >
Query 1. What preparation do you give your land
before you begin to plant ?
2. When do you begin to plant ?
3. Do you select your seed, and how do you know !
the best seed ? Do you prefer seed from
the North or South, and how often do you
change your seed ?
4. How many rows to the task or quarter of an 1
acre ? How many bushels of seed to the
acre ?
5. Do you scatter in the trenches, or as it is technically
called, string plant ?
6. Do you point-flow ? If so, assign the reasons, j
7. How many times do you hoe before you put on ,
the water ?
9. If in grass, would you put on the water or not?
What do you call a good crop to the acre,
or to the hand ?
10. Have you ever ploughed your land while the
crop was growing ? or do you object to it,
and wliy f
? 11. Do you keep your land dry all the winter, or
do you flow it ?
12. Have you ever used salt or brackish water,
and what has been the result ? Have you
ever used lime on your land, and how do
you apply it ?
13. How do you know the best time to cut rice,
and what is the task of a laborer in harvest
T
14. Is there any peculiarity in your preparation cf
rice for market ?
15. Do you ever judge by the roots of the health
of your rice ?
16. Have you ever practised a succession or rotation
of crops, and if so, which do you most
approve of ?
Answers as follows in the order in which the above
queries are submitted.
Query 1. I cultivate inland swamp, of a strong,
tenacious blue clay, which I strive to reduce
to a good tilth, by ploughing a portion,
and always digging what I cannot
plow. I harrow twice before planting, in
as dry a state as is practicable.
2. My land being cold, I seldom begin to plant be. i
fore the first week in April, and never earlier
than the 2oth March.
3. With respect to the first question, I reply, that
I occasionally change my seed, and procure
it from tide swamp, cf light and rich foil,
not regarding whether it is north or south
of me. I judge of seed by its weight I
and being free from grains of white and '
red rice.
4. I plait altogether in half acres, 1.19 feet square ; I
and after related experiments, to ascertain I
the distance best adapted to my land, 1
have determined in favor of 14 inches, and
. sow two bushels of seed to the acre.
5. I ob.erve a medium between the two, and neither
sow very broad or narrow. I have
never planted on string, as it is termed.
6. Being dependent on reserve water, 1 never have ]
had recourse to the point-flowing. j
7. I hoe twice, and do not then water, ur.lcss a j
dry state of the land renders it necessary. I |
1 do not advocate for early or long wa- j
tering. I do not water beyond ten or J
twelve days, until rice is in the second
joi it.
8. My reply to the last query will answer this
also.
9. There is much grass that flourishes in water,
and unless in a very young state, would
not be destroyed. The red and white i
shank for instance, with other water gras. j
If ic q lnrrro iinrhnn nf tlio ornn
II HJUIV l?J u luigv ??*#? v. < ? ?- ? |- ,
grassy, I would have recount to water, us
much of the grass would be destroyed. I
consider fifty bushels of rice to the acre a
fair and good crop ou an average, or ten
barrels to the hand.
jO. I have ploughed a small portion of my rice, 1
when I planted the distance of IB inches, <
but I soon discontinued it, as no material i
advantage resulted from it. 1
Jl. 1 kept my land flowed until February, if prac- 1
tioable, for the use of a reserve mill. t
12. I have never used salt or brackish water on 1
my land. I have this year lint d an acre I
of rice, at the rate of 22 bushels spread on f
the land after ploughing, and harrowed in ?
previously to being trenched. I am at t
present ignorant of tin result from persona! ?
observation, but am m'orme 1 there is f
no visible difference in favor of the pari c
Jinied. '
13. When three or four of the lower grains are beginning
to turn yellow, is, 1 think, the proper
time to begin to cut; and if the rice
stands well up to the husk, three-quarters
of an acre is a reasonable task in cutting.
The tying and carrying to the barn yard
must be regulated by distance and other
circumstances.
11. I used one of .Mr. Luca's water mills,* without
any peculiarity as to preparation.
15. No answer to this query,
lti. I have not paid much attention to a systematic
rotation of crops ; but doubtless, very
beneficial results would reward the agriculturist
who did it.
Permit me to suggest another query, highly important
to the interest of the rice planter, viz ;
The most eligible time of turning off the water,
previous to the cutting of rice ?
Opinions differ much on this subject, and it is
a desideratum really worthy of investigation.
A. Watson, Esq. one of the best planters in this
state, concludes his answers to the foregoing queries
thus:
441 will now in a few woids sum up the whole ol
the art, which, from my experience, is requisite :
fallow your land close in the winter; be industrious
; attend strictly to the hoeing ; pick it clean,
and you may always expect a fair crop." He generally
averaged ti(J bushels to tho acre.

Prior to the invention of Strong &. Moody's Patent
Rice Mill, rice was cleaned by the pestle and
mortar and wrought by hand, or by water, steam
or horse power. When cleaned by hand the rice
in its wrought or unboiled state is put into a mortar
holding about a peck; the pestle is then applied
by the hand until the grain is divested ot its outer
hull and inner cuticle, after which the flour and
small rice may separated from the large by fans
and screens, or it may be winnowed. In th s manner
rice is sometimes prepared for family use, but
never in this country for market. When rice is
cleaned for market by pestle and mortar in all our
rice-growing States, the following is the process,
viz : It is first passed through what is called a
sand screen, which removes most of the sand and
trash from the rice. From that screen it goes
through a pair of Liverpool millstones, so wide
apart as only to remove the outer hull; as it comes
from these it is carried by elevators to a fan which
blows ofF the chaff, (which is the outer hull) It
pasess from the fan into mortars, these mortars
contain about four bushels each and arc in number
from 5 or 6 up to 22, seldom more, according
to the work to be done and the power possessed
where it is pounded with heavy pestles from one
hour and a half to more than two hours, when it
is removed from the mortars by band into a place
prepared for it, where it has to remain untii the
moisture which Ins been produced by the action
of the pestle on the rice, is dried. Then it is earricd
up by elevators to what is called the rolling
screen, which is about 1G feet long, having three
different size meshes. Through the first size the
Hour passes, through the second, the small rice,
through the third, the large or merchantable rice,
and over the end of this screen, the head rice.?
From that screen, the small and merchantable
rice goes into a brushcr, so as to remove the Hour
from the grain. Under this brushcr is a fan
through which it passes. From this fan it is carried
to the barrel, where it is well packed, and
completely prepared for market. This mill was
invented by a Mr. Lucas an Englishman, and has
been in use for many years in our southern States,
and has proved of great benefit.
Strong & Moody's Patent Rice Mill was invented
in the town of Northampton, Massachusetts,
about the year 1833. It cleans the rice on an
entire now principle from that of the pestle and
mortar. This mill, after overcoming the various
difficulties which most of new inventions have to
contend with, is now in successful operation in
Charleston, South Carolina, and various other
parts of the world. It is thought bv many who
arc able to judge, that it will ere long come into
general use. This mill can use all the machinery
that is used in a pestle mill, excepting the pestle
and mortar. llub!>ors urc substituted for them,
made in the form of millstones, from 18 inehes to
more than five feet in diameter; the smallest drove
by hand, the larger by horse, steam, or water power.
Through these the rice after it is hi/lled, is
passed, and in its passage, is cleaned in the most
perfect manner, is less broken than when pounded
with heavy pestles, is cleaned much faster, is more
free from grit, and keeps better than by any other
mode of cleaning. The reasons for its keeping
better in all climates, as it is found to do, (either
on the sea or on the land) are caused by a greater
degree of heat being produced by the rubbers;
which is near 153 degrees in place of 65 or 70 degrees,
which is believed to be produced by the pestle
and mortar. This degree of heat produced by
the rubbers, in a good measure kiln-dries the rice,
and at the same time removes the dampness from
the flour, so that it can be at once passed through
the screen, brushcr and fan into the bnrrcl, when
it is ready for market. In this process it is more perfectly
divested of the flour (on account of the flour
being so well dried by the increased heat the rice
receives from passing through the rubbers,) than
by any other mode of cleaning, liy this new
mode of cleaning, the eye. of the grain is much
more effectually removed, which is another great
reason for its keeping so well.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

From the American Farmer.
THE WHITE oa BELGIAN CARr.OT.
We noticed last season the success of our fclow-townsinan,
Mr. Geo. Law, in raising a crop
>f this variety of the Carrot. lTpon that occasion
ve spoke favorably of it as a vegetable for (he ta)Ic
and as food for stock, and our attention has
>ecn again drawn to the subject of their superioriy,
by a report of a crop upon the farm of Lord
Ducic at Whiteficld, Ireland, which we find in
he Irish Farmer''s Gardener's Magazine,
mblished in Dublin. The extent of the piece of
p-ound in culture was 1 aero 35 perches, from j
vhich 64 cart-loads of roots were taken. The )
tverage weight of a carrt.load was found to be 10 j
wt. Thlr. gives 32 ton-, as the- total weight of the
rop, which is at the rate 03 ton^ 3 envt. or 976 |
I 1-G bushels per acre. The soil on which they were
| grown is a sandy loam, and the writer observes
I that they were the heaviest crop on the farm.?
I The seed was sown in the second week in April,
j 011 land which had been ploughed 10 inches deep,
I on the flat, in rows lfl inches apart. The seed
I had been previously mingled witli damp sand for
several days, in order to partially sprout it and rcndet
it easier of being drillod. The plants were
thinned out at a fornight old, G inches asunder in
the row, and received only one hand and two horse
hoeings, which completed their culturo. The expense
of their culture is estimated at only half that
of any other root-crop grown on the estate of Lord
j Ducie. The ground had been, the previous year,
i in Swedish turnips, when it received a dressing of
j manure, the carrots, however, were not manured, j
The conductor of the Magazine, whcnco wo
j have made this abstract, states that the white oarrots
generally exceed the red ones in weight, from
j 8 to 9 tons per acre. Of the white carrot there
. arc two varieties, the best is that which makes a
larger portion of its root above ground.
In speaking of the acreable product of tho white
carrot, Col. L? Coutcur informed the editor that
he had grown 33 tons to the acre, which is equal
to 1113 2-3 bushels.
From what we have seen of this root, the above
products do not suprise us; on the contrary, they
arc what we cxpeeted from a root of the kind, antf
should be gratified to see it introduced into gene
rul culture, not only for the purjxasesof the table,
but as a provender for milch cows; for of a trulh, ;
j we arc solicitous to see these animals better eared
I for than they generally are.
WATER PROOF GLUE.
! Melt common glue in the smallest posj
siblc quantity of water, and add, by drops,
I linseed oil that has been rendered drying
i by having a small portion of litharge burled
in it; the glue being briskly stirred
when the < il is added.
Glue will resist water, to a considerable
extent, by being dissolved in skimmed
milk.
The addition of a finely levigated chalk,
to a solution of common glue in water, j
strengthens it, and renders it suitable for j
signs, or oiher work that is exposed to the j
weather.
A glue (or cement) that will hold j
against fire or water, may be made bv j
mixing and boiling together linseed oil and i
quicklime. This mixture must be redu j
cod to the consistence of soft putty, and j
then spread on tin plates and dried in the j
shade, where it will dry very hard. This
may afterwards be melted like common
glue, and must be used while hot.

Sl'TT AT U ICK~ AND THE IRISH.
We acknowledge the receipt of a copy
of an Oration, delivered before the Hibernian
Provident Society of New Haver,'
by \V, E. Robinson, March 17, 1842.?'
Prefixed to it is an account of the origin
. .>* O
and organization of the Society, and of
its recent festival in honor of Ireland and
its patron Saint. The o-ation is written ;
in a style characlcristic of the .writers of'
the country which it celebrate.*, and I
breathes a spirit of ardent patriotism for j
the land of the author's adoption, as well j
as for that of his nativity. We offer a copious
extract, embracing a portion of history
with which we confess we have not |
before been acquainted; and presuming
that many of our readers arc in a like
state of darkness, they will probably he,
like us, entertained with this sketch of
the honored and reverenced St. Patrick.
It is stated that the Irish, under their
monarch Nial, made an incursion into
i France, captured the city of Tours, and
returned to Ireland with two hundred
nrisoncrs, who were sold into slavery.?
I ' r
Among these were, Patrick, then about
sixteen years of age, and his two sisters.
The orator proceeds;?
" Patrick was horn A. D., 3S7, in that
part of France which is called Boulogne.
Ilia father, Calphurn, supposed by
some to he of Roman descent, and by
c * I
others to be descended trom jowisii captives
brought to Rome by Til us*, after
the destruction of Jerusalem, A. D. 70,
held a political office fur some lime, which
he afterward abandoned, and having entered
into holv orders, became a deacon.
If is mother, Conchcssa, was a native of
France. His original name was Succath,
but when the Pope conferred on him the
Patrician order, the title of Patricius supplanted
the baptismal name.
' On arriving a captive in Ireland, A.
D. 403, Patrick was sold to one IMilclio,
living in that part of Ireland now known
as Antrim, who appointed the youthful
slave as his shepherd. The mountain, ;
now called Sliebli Miss, or the Mountain :
of the Moon, was (he place ho chose for
his meditation and prayer. After seven
years' slavery, Patrick returned to the 1
continent,and studied at Tours, about four '
years. Having spent about twenty years 1
J more in study and meditation on lonely 1
islands, and in secluded retreats of piety, '
j he visited Rome, with recommendations
from St. German to the Pope. Ireland
had still hern before his youthful ima- '
gination. From his own pen we learn
that he had thought so much about her, 1
that she was present with him whether '
sleeping or waking; at i in dreams lie 1
saw a messenger, hearing a scroll, on '
o ' o '
which were written the words?" The
voice of the Irish." r
"Though Paladins had been sent bv c
Pope Celestinc to Ireland, and though se- I
vcral other Christians had visited, or were I
natives of the island ; though Pelagius, '
and his disciple Celstius, who were both
Irishmen, had disseminated soine of their
"" "I"" ri nwe nmnnrr thr> no/inlo vol C
& ,
Ireland had not renounced Pelngianism.
The old Irish j?rovcrh?u Not to Pailadius, 1
lint to Patrick,did (iod ^rant the convcr- 1
sion of Ireland"?shows that Christianity
had scarce hccii known, w hen Patrick ar
rived in the country. Tho ancient Irish
worshipped the Sun, as Bel, whose rites
they celebrated in temples hot made with
hands, but in the grove of oaks which the
great Supreme Being had raised lor his
own worship, and covered in his own ricli
livery of green, and in whose honor two
tires wore kindled in every district on the
first of May. The moon, too, under the i
name of Re, hud her appropriate worship, '
and on her altar a fire was kindled on the I
lirst of November, from which the winter ;
hearths of tho people were lighted. Groves
and wells, stones and pillars, were consccratod
to idols, and in the plain of Magh
Sioaeth, or Field of Slaughter, human
victims were offered in sacrificing to their
groat Crorn Cruagh, who was surrounded |
hy twelve lesser idols, representing, most |
probably, the twelve signs of the Zodiac. !
The round towers of Ireland, about which
so much has been written, but concerning
which no antiquarian has given any dofinite
account, and which have existed,
probably, since the days of Solomon, when
Tyre, Egypt, .and Ireland were united
through Phoenician commerce, were, pro.
bably used in the worship of the god Bel. I
for taking observations on tlx; heavenly I
bodies, and thus determining the cqtiinoc- ;
tial and solstitial times, by which to regulate
the recurrence of religious festivals.
Incense was offered in high places, on the
hills and under the green trees. The
Druids were accustomed to light up blazing
fires, and after performing im-antations
over them, made the herds of cattle
to pass through them.
? Put these things, (hough interesting.
n ' n ~
must not he dwelt upon here. These dark
superstitions, and the reign of idolatry,
were doomed to melt away before the
Pglitof Christianity. The sun, which the
Irish had been accustomed to worship,
was seen to yield his honors and glory
before a briglier luminary. In bis own
simple language, St. Patrick told them
that " tlie sun, which we behold, rises daily
al the command of Clod for our use ;
yet will he never reign, nor shall his
splendor endure ; and all those who adore
him will descend wretchedly into punishment.
Put we believe and adore the true
Sun, Christ." The Captive hoy had
grown to he a Bishop of the Church of
Rome, and thus clothed with apostolic
power, he returned to the land of his adoption,
A. I). 43*2, hearing the words of.
eternal life to a brave and learned, yet
still pagan people.
i "Patrick first landed near Dublin, hut
meeting with much opposition I here, he ,
re-emharked, and landed in Ulster, in the
north of Ireland, near what is now called
Strangford. After converting many of j
the nothern poodle, and visiting his for- [
mcr master, Milchn, (who obstinately re- !
fused to he converted, and, as some his. n
torinns tell us, hearing that his son and .
two daughters had forsaken the religion i
of their fathers, set fire to his house and j
threw himself into the flames,) Patrick 11
visited lite hall of Tarn, where a great j
meeting of the princes and hicrarchs of j
the nation was assembled.
"On the eve of the festival of Eistcr, J
I
Patrick pitched his tent for the night in 11
the neighborhood of Tara, where the
monarch Leogair and the assembled princes
were celebrating the rites of their i j
sun-worship, and there at night-fall kin- ,
died the paschal fire. As the law was, <
that no fire should he kindled, except by i
flinic obtained from the altar of Rjl, |
wiiich had not vet been lighted, the king j '
was angry, and the Druids, speaking I
with prophetic truth, exclaimed?"This 5
fire, which has now been kindled before i *
our eyes, unless extinguished this very!,
night, will never be extinguished through- j1
out all time. Moreover, it will tower j,
above all the fires of our ancient rites, |j
and he who lights it will ere long scatter j (
your kingdom." Indignant as the king |
was, he nevertheless consented to hear 11
Patrick preach the following day, and j c
dispute with the most leurnrd of the Dru-1 r
ids. So convincing were the arguments ! I
o n
of the apostle, that the arch-poet, Dull- ' s
tach, was converted, and the monarch j 1
exclaimed, " It is better to lielievc than ! j1
die." The queen, if not also the mnn- 11
arch, was converted, together with their J
f. it ? I
two daughters. n was on mis occasion, i
w-v n
that Patrick, when told by the Druids
that the doctrine of the Trinity was ah-1
surd, as three could not exist in one,1 ^
stooped down, and pulling a shamrock, '
which has three leaves on one stem, re. ,,
plied, "To prove the reality and possibil- p
ity of the existence of the Father, Son, si
;ind Holy Cihost, I have only to pluck up o
this liurnhle plant, on which wc have

# J |
Aongus, King of Munstcr, sent to Ta- ^
a for Patrick. Ifc accompanied the sj
ncssengers to Cashel, and there convert- vv
;il the king, who immediately requested ,.(
lie saint to administer the sacrament of w
nptisin. Patrick, delighted to bear the j*
eqtiesf, fastened the sharp point of his
:rosier in the floor, and inadvertently pi
lierccd the royal foot. Tiie king, sup- la
losing that this was part of the ceretno- ,r
iv, bore the pain with becoming fortitude. '):
I'hc Irish painter, Barry, the friend of ,r
iiirkc, has given one of his master efforts st
vv
in this subject. j
The apostle made a journey into Con- ^
taught, passing through the county Lei
rim, where the Plain of Slaughter was j)t
ituated, and where the bloody idol Croin- |;l
Jtuagh, to which, as of old to Moloch,
children were offifrod in sacrifice, was | g
worshipped. This idol, wt;h his worship,! r
Patrick destroyed, and raised in its stead ! |
a Christian church. During the season j I
of Lent, he retired to the lofty mountain,! I
now known as Crungh Patrick, which r
overlooks Clew hay, in the county Mayo. r
According to traditionary storv, it was t8
. " I
[rorri this hill that St. Patrick, having col-*
locted all the venomous creatures togetli- j
er drove them into the sea?to which
Percival, in the lines which he has writ. (
ten for this celebration, refers:? i (
Ilark ! to the voice that through G'onnaught rc- (
i
sounded . i
Aloft from her mountains so high and so green? j j
It spake?through that gem, by the bright ocean I
bounded? I
No venomous creature again was seen." ?
mm > ,11 I
Here, on the heights ot an untrodden ;
mountain, the prayers of the pious Pat- : '
rick rose to heaven for his much-loved !4
Ireland. And no wonder that the people, j
as they saw scu-fou I and lords of prey at- j
tractcd thither hy the strange sight of a
? o a
human being in so unfrequented a region,
readily believed that evil spirits came j
obedient to his will, and that every relic i
of poisoned superstition was banished j 1
by him, who could command even (locks *
of winced demons to obey. j <
;
At great assemblies of the people?at j
meetings convened for settling the sue- I
cession to any of the thrones of Ireland? j
Patrick was ever present. At one of j ^
these assemblies, it is said that the seven j:
princes royal who were disputing about j *j
the succession to the throne of their do- j ti
ceased father, were converted, together 1 t
with twelve thousand people, who were ! v
ioon afterwards baptized hy hi in. i ^
After visiting almost every part of (Jon- j c
naught, he made another journey to IJI- ^
>ter, founded in Derrv and Tyrone the j (
cathedrals ?>f Derry and Cloghaer, passed J
.ho river* Bann, at Coleraine, where he ; '
'
errcted a church arid an abbey, and tli^n , '
returned to Armagh, where, pleased with '
the beauty of the rj>< t, ho resolved to \ '
build a great cathedral, splendid above !*
all the other churches in the island. The 14
Metropolitan Cathedral of Ireland was 1
here built by Patrick, about the year 44"). j I
Since that time, Armagh has been the '
ecclesiastical capital of the island, and | v
here, at present, is the seat of the Lord ; '
Primate. ! '
A mono the monasteries, which he foun- I1
ded iri Mcath, Duhlin, Kildare, Carlow, *
Armagh, Louth, Longlerd, Antrim, Derry,
Tyrone, Roscommon, Sligo, Fermanagh,
and almost every other county in
Ireland, was one at Lough-Dcrg, in the
county Doiu gal, to which he frequently
retired in after life, to devote himself cn
tirely to fasting, meditation, and prayer. }
On this very island, at the present tune, nM
the people are accustomed to assemble for '
prayer, fasting, and penanee.ns their great v
npostie set them tiie example 1 I centuries '
siiro. I
From Armagh. Patrick went to Dublin, ^
where he had before been unsuccessful. *
On the evening of his arrival, a son of ?
Alphin, the chief of the city, was drowned 1
in the river Lilly. The Lady Alphin, i
though a pagan, ran to the; Christian apostle,
and, on her knees, implored him to
come and pray over her child. Moved
by her suffering*, he went with her and
knoll by the body of the child, which bad
just been taken from the water; and, hnv- c
ing touched it with his crosier, which was j ^
called the stdjf of Jesus, it recovered, and j
was given to the arms of its weeping j
mother. Alphin, his family, and his pen. 'j
pie wore converted, and a portion of Innd |j
was presented to the saint, as a token of 1 ij
rntitude, on which a church was built, M
ind which is now the site of St. Patrick's S(
r,:i I iir?r!r;i I Dublin. jl
Though very successful in his npnstol- j it
c mission, Patrick's life was not all a i (|
(month current, even in his labors of love j e:
or Ireland. On one occasion, while pass- ! Ji
ng through what is now called King's | p,
:ountv, his charioteer, O.Iran, who had |?
earnt the intent ion of a desperate chief j };(
ain to attack the saint, and finding no j rc
ither wav to save him, under the pretence j a.
?f being sick or fatigued, prevailed upon j hi
\atrirk to exchange seats, and so the I th
ervant received the lance which was in- i ,\J
ended for his master. This, to the cred
t of Ireland he it told, is the on'y martyr al
n the history of the -ntroduction of Chris- 01
ianity to the island. In his confession, w
trick acknowledges that he used to bl
aakc presents to the unconverted kings, tt
nd to use other means for preventing ' w
general persecution. This was his plan |a
ur recommending the charitable doctrines e>
f the gospel, and it would he well if some ei
lodcrn apostles would imitate his exam- I v?
l?r, rather than proscribe, persecute, and
lander, as is too often the case. On an- j (J
tlier occasion, a design was planned for _
iking away Ins life, by a hand of robbers. : s,
'ho chief bandit he not only bufiled in te
is designs upon his life, hut actually ' tii
rouglit him to profess the Christian re- j n<
gion. Patrick imposed upon him as a j th
en ince, that he should lake one of the j \\
ail curraghs or leathern boats, and with ; y{
o clothing, saving a coarse garment, an
iou!d trust himself to the waves and
iuds fitr his safety. The penitent obey, to
d, and was carried to the Isle of Man, jj
here ho was afterwards bishop of the m
land. oc
A British prince, named Coroticus, who w;
rofesscd to he a Christian, invaded Ire- a
nd, and plundered the people of a dis- ar
ict in Munster, where Patrick had been ra

lurdercd, nnd some taken prisoner and | th
*ld to the Pielish chiefs, who were then en
urring against England. Patrick, in a j *
Iter to this pirate, which, besides his ru
m Cession, is the only piece of his writi"
now extant, denounced him as a rob- in
tt and a murderer, and, as bishop of Ire- I m;
rid, declares him to he excommunicated. m<
Dumig liic lunuitulcr ol Ins life, the I 01
*ood Patrick visited tlie several churches'
ind encouraged learning among the pco.
?lc. It is said that he wrote with his own
land three hundred copies of the alpha>ct.
After a long life of piety, usefulness
md fame, the saint of Ireland sank to
est, at the age of seventy-eight, or as
some say, at the age of one hundred and
wenty, revered by nil who knew him.?
Where darkness had been till thostarof
lis advent appeared, his light went out
icaccfully, and blended with the glory of
'lie gospel sun. No pomp heralded his
;oming ; no mailed armies guarded his
King bed: l?Ht the hosts of heaven wcro
mnt on their wings of light, to hear the
laint to his place of rest ; and as they
lore him with songs of praise over the
leecy drapery of heaven, the sounds of
ingelic praises sung to his name, have
>cen caught from heaven, and re-echoed
>om earth,and still live fresh and undying
unong a warm-hearted and grateful pco>le.

villi which the political and religious subugation
of Ireland has been attempted.
The annals of her fame and glory were
aimed by the Vandals of Henry If.; and
he venerated memorials of her religion

a used the destruction of the records of
iVclsh,and Scottish literature, as well as
if Irish learning, that tyrants might subugate

nitids the memory of their former greatless.
The 17th of March, you know, is St.
Patrick's day. It is the day of his death
indcnnotiizalion. On the 17th of March,
105. he died. 11 is funeral ohstrrpiie* lased
for a long time. Hvcry bishop and
iriest wished to assist in the holy ceremo

without intcrrii|ition. The torches kept
turning, dispelled the darkness of the
light, and made the whole time ono perictunl
day.

On Friday last, October 21, Col Furi

if St. John's 1'arish, Her k ley, in this
Jlatc, hunting in that i'arish, put (he dogs
rito a small drive, near Mack Tom Hay. ^
I'hcy soon jumped a tine doe. Oneof the
oys !hat was driving heard a tussclinthe
ushe*. in the direction where the dogs
rere giving tongue, inn few minutes,
eeing the deer coming out of the drive,
te boy tired. He supposed he had killed
ic deer, for it ran only a few paces and
ion dropped. On going up to it, and
camming it, to his great surprise he could
iscern no shot in ii, hut t/uit it iras comJelely
emboirclled. He sw ung it on his
ursc, however, and having sounded his

? e up. On the formei expressing some
itonishment at the expedition (he fellow

lassa, he never been liab any !"
The circumstance being explained as
)ove related, Col. Ferguson put the dogs
n the scent, and trailed hack to the spot
hence the deer was started. Trading tho
lood hack about 200 yards, they came to
ie bed where the doe had been I) ing,
hen jumped by the dogs,, apd near it, a
rge sharp siuig, which, in her alarm to
cape, it was very evident, it was very
ridenl from certain signs that could not

niped upon and ripped herself open.?
n the snag a quantity of hair was found
-the stomach was directly under tho
iag, and the rest of the entrails about
n steps from the snag. The deer at tho
me she dropped and was picked up, had
ntliing in her but her heart and liver, so
at she must have run some distanco
ithout stomach and bowels?about 200
lrds, that being the distance from tho
iag to where she fell.
