We have extinguished the Indian title

The superficial extent of the lands To

meers were every day settling ihemvc.>
\v:ts equal to New-England, New.

These settlors could not live long
this land without acquir .ig t.ic idea of |
>perty of each other. It would then J
;omc unpleasant and dangerous for j
migrants to take possession of their
ids. Y>e were bound to yield mere
tract rights to the necessity of live
jc. We could not enforce our rights
any wny. The courts and jurie s would
itaiu the settlers. Should we resort to
r army ? It would cost us twice as
tell as the income from the lands. The
army avoid 1 allow of only one
dicr to each 2.")!) square miles. Tiius,
wc d?d not cede the lands, wc shou'd j
e thrni in contlicts with the settlers.
Hut another danger war, (hat, if we ;
1 not cede the lands, the States would I
ze upon them. After the next apportion,
znt, the new States would have the asrideiicy,?certainly
in the otin-r House
d they were daily increasing their reive
strength. They would, after a few |
ars, seize upon the lands within their!
iits, and ave should get no conditions of f

As to the project for distributing the!
>ceeos of the sales of the lands, he cor.,
lercd it as idle, unjust or foolish. Tne
bet of it would be to increase taxation
the amount of the sum raised. If any
ate received the same share that its
nation would amount tr, it was iilie ; i;
received mere, it was unjust; if ics*, i.
is fooiish.

explained that he proposed to J?t apart |a
the proceeds both t:,r the Navy and Ar.oy] P
Mr. Calhoun warmly expressed himself
in favor of sustaining i'te Navy, as tlie ^
chief arm ofour d fence. Every part of j*
the Union vas alike interested in it? n
the North and East for the projection of
their rich commerce;?tlie Southern c
States for a barrier against the fanati- t!
cism and incendiarism of the West In- c
dies;?and the great vailey of the Mississippi
for the defence of the only channel s
by which her products could be conveyed ic
to market. He would accept the Sena-! a
tors' proposition as a modification of his j I
hill.
Mr. Linn said, he would offer if, if the n
bill should be adopted.
Mr. Crittenden spoke in reply to Mr. j
Calhoun, and partially also to *he remarks ' f
of Mr. Benton yesterday. Mr. C. con- ^
tended that the proceeds of I he public j,
lands belonged of right to the States in | j
iti common, and the> ouglit to have them, j _
Were there not luxuries enough that ;
might be taxed, which would lie collected i
from the pockets of the rtch,?wines, silk, j
Sec. He hoped the proceedsol the public l o
lands would be taken for the States,? {i
such a step would help to bring hack the j ^
government to a proper and just economy. 1 H
More than thirty millions had been ex-'
jviidcd annually during the administra-1 ?
lion of Mr. Van Burcn. The item of the i11
public lands was only a feeder to the ex- 1 c
travagance of his administration. j a
Mr. C. went on to reply to the argu- j
merits of Mr. Callicun, denouncing them J (
as wild visionary, and unstatesma.iiike. !
Much iiad been said about government ; j
pa'mange; but what was the plan ofMr. 11
Cal oun, but to give to tue i e\v States 11
;>rij vast royal donation, of e gbty mil- a
lions of acres? He repudiates the idea J
that the new Slaiev, however much they '
might desire to have the land, would ever I
%io any thing so unjusV'8 to se ze, with- j J
o:k law, the property of tin ir fellow citi- j t
z-M.s. Might not those who fear thai j!
ihoy would do so unless this measure i '

he would follow this matter through all ! j
the mazes of commerce. He ghriid in i
having made the r mar!: he did. about |1
lb, States sucking the life blood of *hr j!
Government.. In 1830 when the ques-.
tion for the distribution of the surplus j i
came up. he denounced it then as a step '
fatal to their sovereignty; hut he did nol i
think it would so soon prove <*0. Hi saw 1
with humiliation that Kings and Princes *'
% >% i
had been broughi to the feet of the British
Bankers to settle a mercantile ac- 1
count; but aii that was nothing, compared i
to seeing the election of it President ol
these United Stares marie a stock jobbing 1
matter on the London Exchange.
Mr. Crittenden repelled this insinuation I''
with a fil l share of pleasantry, not un- (
mixed with sarcasms ofa keen and biting I ]
kind. He said the simpathtc* of crown, r
cd heads were strong, and that if any I'
such influence had been used, it was |'
much more likely to have been in favor ol 1
King Martin than i.i favor of an humble '
log cabin candidate. Where did such
|
influence prevail? There was not a State
of the Union but was represented here? j \
let them answer! Was the calumny to j
apply to the who'e of the American Pco- j1
; ie, that a President was made by a for- j
oigri power through that meanest of all j
injivenres, money! He would answer
for the hardy yeomanry of his own Slate,
that not a single vote was polled under j
such degrading influence. He could tell j(
the gentleman it was not that which over- i?
M
threw the party, but it was the fire from j
the same flint that struck the spark of the |'
revolution^?a disposition to pverthrow j
mismanagement, tyranny, &nd rapacious- i
ne.va, ' * * . '
Iloplics and counter replies were p}tple, ,
but no question was taken.

I iK.fieve this is the most remarkable

Washington, Thursday, Jan. 14th.
The public lands was again the subject
>f discussion in the Senate,.to-day. The ^
nterestofihe debate does not appear to
lag. Mr. Clay is evidently ready to
peak upon it, and perhaps Mr. Webster.
For twenty years, this subject has engaged
much of the attention of Congress
md it will be the engrossing topic of dis:ussion
and agita ion, for some years to
owe, and, indeed, until it shall be finally

As to the pre-emption laws, he thought
he impedance of them was^reatly over ptrd.
Practically, they were of little
ivail. Their professed o!)jcct was to present
the injustice of turning a settler out
>f his homo, and giving it, with his improvements,
to *.hj speculator. But this
was a ease that never happened. He had
never known an instance of it. The or.
cupants always sent an agent to the sale,,
ind their land was bought without difficulty
for their use. No one ever attempted
to take their land from them by over>idiog
them; for it would be as much as
iny one's life was worth, to do it. Tho
>re-?mption laws were, therefore, merely
Jcclaratory of what was already the com
non law of the new Slates, *

The joint resolution to transferso much *
