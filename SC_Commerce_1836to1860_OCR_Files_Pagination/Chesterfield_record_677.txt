'-W.1
We are now called upon, Fellow citizens,
hy the return of this day to celebrate
the goodness of that (iod who
f riuvuf.l f.ur tYeble efTo.fs, as a nation,
with such astonishing nnd unparalleled
MlCCtKS.
Wno can read the liiir ory of our.
Moody contest with Great B itain. and J
not bo convinced that the strong arm
of Jehovah uas bared for our safety and \
defence? And shall we refuse Ilim the
honor, the praise, and the untiring obedience
which Me ho justly claims at cur
hands?
Whilst we would invoke the aid of (ire.
cian and Roman eloquence in proclaim
ing the praise, .and celebrating the bravery
of the worthies of our revolution ; yet we
would not forget that our national victo
ry must be ascribed to the special interposition
of a wise, holy, and Almighty
Providence?a truth that was sensibly
realized, and publicly arknow it dged b\
those who fought our battles for us.
It become* us too to rejoice with trembling,
tor this is an eventful period in the
history of our ow n nation in particular,
and toe world in general.
The spirit of discord and dissatisfaction
of insubordination and i.-.isrule, like the
boisterous subjects of Eohis, w hen ideascd
from their gloomy pr:s in, seems to In*
stalking abroad through our world, causing
the thrones of King to totter beneath
them, and tarnishing with his foul touch
the purest institutions, and most umblemished
characters, and striking with his
mighty and poisonous wand, the fairest
prospects, blasting the brightest hop's,
and paralyzing the mightiest energies of
the most strong, wise, and stable govern
wont* 011 earth.
I do not say that wo have a Caesar
or Catalinc who is striving to subvert the
liberties of our nation ; hut I do say most
emphatically, that the eh inents of destruction
are gathering rapidly in oar po
liticul heavens, and that citizen must be
fearfully blinded by prejudice or parli
spirit, who docs not already see the dark
and omnious cloud, wiiich may dis.

it is a melancholy truth, thatour ?nv*
eminent is approaching a crisis of fearful
magnitude, and one which .ill the learning
o 7 wisdom,
and *1< quence of our ablest
statesmen cannot, of (htmsclvcs, either
turn aside or defeat.
D?> you demand the evidence ?
"What mean -those mobs which have
infested some of our largest c ities ?
Why do tuousrnds assemble under

unoffending portion of our citizens?

if oossible, to avoid all such allusions on
the present occasion.
80 far cs the spirit of moboerncy is concerned,
it is exceedingly diiiicull, in ordinary
cases, to ascertain to what political
party the insu-gents belong ; and if (lie
Arctct were revealed, it would he found
that the crowd is composed of men of different
political ciittis.
And yet, who can doubt that if a corrupt
administration should invoke the
aid ot this disorganizing npiiit, it would be
pule to accomplish its most ambitious '
achemcs ?
In view of these facts is it not the 1
iultrcst ns well as the duty < f every !

Permit me to allude very briefly to 1
I anothoi dark speck in our political
! horizon. We read in the Bible,
that Jehovah proclaimed from Mount
Sinai, in a voice of thunder?' Remember
the Sabbath-day lo keep it holy." How
is this mandate regarded by our citizens
generally ? It is set at naught, and
treated with contempt. VVcare empirically
a nation of sabbath-breakers. The
high and the low. the rich and the ooor,
the free and the bond, the learned and
illiterate are, to a very great extent,
chargeable with this crime. And what is
it? It is rebellion against God ; it is treai
*on against His government. He has
Io . o
commanded us, under pain of the most
j solemn and awful penalties, to reverence
! the sabbath day, and keep it holy, hv devo
oil itd cnrroi-i hours to llu? DlirnOSeS ol
j ,w.fe .... ?... ? r f
I His worship ; but bow have we obeyed
j Him ? Uo to out high ways, our rail|
roads, our riverj, and our places of public
I resort, anil you will sec how far wo regard
! the laws of Jehovah. Men generally seek
on this day, either their pecuniary emo.
1 lament, or their sensual and intellectual
| gratification, and how can such a people
j nope to enjoy the favor and protection of
j that God, whose institutions the wantonly
j trample under their unhallowed feet 7 It
j ought not to he disguised, tliut,??a nation
j we are highly criminal in this particular ;
and if we wculJ avoid the doom of other
nations and of other ages for this very sin,
.t behoves us to humble ourselves and
j repent in sackcloth and ashes.
| That nation must have advanced very
] fur in the science of iniquity, which is
prepared to insult Jehovah in broad day
light, and in the noon tide of Gospel
truth, lie has spoken once and again,
both in His word and His Providence?
He has whispered in accents of tncrcy,
an { warned in a voice louder than the
united artillery of heaven ; but we have
hern equally deaf to both. Thus we have
shown that we spurned his mercy and
defied his omnipotence.
J When I see these things, I cannot hut
tremble for the safety of my country, for
should this evil practice continue to increase
for the next half century as it has
.lone for the last twenty five years, there
is every reason to believe that God will
j vindicate the honor of His law, and the
; justice of His administration in th?i com.
j plete and final overthrow of the liberties
j of this guillv nation. When I road of the
J desolate cities and sterile plain* /J" Judea,
I cannot but fear that the day \\irl come,
if we repent not, when our republic will
live only in song, and when our citizens
shall be the abject slaves of a foreign and
oppressive despotism. You tnnv regard
j my fears as groundless, and smile at my
\ weakneg*?so thought the Jews when
j they were faithfully warned by their scrj
var.ts, I lie prophets, and yet. n-las, they
I discovered, when it was too late, that the
j prediction was true. May this dark
! cloud tn our political heavens he rolled

He must be strangely blind who does

i influx of emigrants from the old world,

Illicitly how to her mandates, nnd wear

despotism, or be crushed by her cruel and
implacable anathamas. I appeal to im- I
partial history. Tell me, when has it J
ever been known that popery was the
friend of civil, political, und religious lib*
erty ? Already has the pope fixed his
avaricious eye upon these happy and
prosperous states, and he hopes soon to
wear them as the brightest jewels in his
crown. Then may you bid farewell to
your Bibles, and your sanctuaries?
your lives, your fortunes, and your liberties
; or become the degraded subjects of
the vilest despot that ever di>graced our
world! Again:
Will you allow me to touch, with a
gentle and affectionate hand, a subject,
upon which most of you, perhaps, are
very sensitive?I mean The manner in
which this day is generally observed, I
do not intend to call in question the pro
priety of celebrating our national jubilee ;
but I ask you as sober, intelligent, and
| rational men, w hether the Fourth of July
is generally observed in such a way as to
be acceptable to the Hod of armies? If
He fought our battles and gave us the
victory, is it rational that we should demonstnle
our gratitu le by acts of profanity
nnd beastly intemperance ? Alas, how
many thousands there are in this free nnd
! happy land, who seem to feel that the
I ret urn of this day gives them full nnd perj
feet license to swear with the profane, to
j eat with the glutton, and drink with the
! drunken ! The earth groans under the
j . ?
weight of our abominations, and calls for
retributive justice. When Grecian and
I
; Roman herons returned from the vtctoriuus
battle field, they decorated their
j Temples, and offered sacrifice to their
! Gods ^ init we are more irrational than
they. Th y knew no Gods but their
*
! dumb idols, .and vet thev were far more
i consistent with their principles than the
citizens of the United States. Wo have

Jy avk, hi there not danger -that c-vrn the
! abuse, of our joyful jubilee may bring
| down upon us. the withering displeasure
of the God of nations ?
I will on!}' add one further remark at
present in confirmation ?f the idea which
1 has been advanced respecting the danger*
I that threaten our national rutn?namofy :
I The strong, unkind, and hitler nnimosj.
( ties uh'ch prevail between the North and
I the South, in .plain language, The. doc!
m "
i frines and principles of tlx Abolitionists
If these misguided men and women would
confine their efforts to morals .and rel ginn
. we should not feel very much anxiety on
!
iifetnilijnct; hut when we see them grasp jug
at civil poww. and seizing to change
i our laws, and our euntom*, wo cannot dij
vest ourselves of fear and alarm. Who
i cannot foresee the dangerous and fatal
?
; consequences that must necessarily result
J to the South, if they should ever gain the
i ascendancy in our political affairs ? Will
I southern men tamely sit by, and see their
rights, and their proj?erfy unjustly swept
away by five rude and unfeeling hand of
I fanaticism ? I will not insult you by
. ;
' pressing the qnostion. Whenever this
| period ariives, if it ever does, it will be
, tlie signal for lighting the torch of discord,
j s dition, and civil war, which will soon
, burn out the vitals of this free and happy
j nation. If talents, energy, industry, j
, money, and impudence can effect this
j work. it will soon do Gone?which, may
j find of His infinite incrcy, forbid !
We have thus taken a cursory survey
j of tome of tho evils which endanger the
j perpetuity and stability of our national
j institutions; and I am at a hxs to decide,
1 whether we should rejoice, or m nirn ?
j whether we should array ourselves in the
habiliments of mirth, or ciotbo ourselves
in sackcloth and ashes. Ot one thing
we may all rest perfectly satisfied, viz.
It is the imperative duty of this nation to
! humble itself before Ciod, and beseech j
dim to remove those crying ov ils Iroin our j
land, which are our reproach note, and j
may become hereof far our viler and final I
ruin ! Notwithstanding, however, the j
da?i: pietwreof our future prospects which j
has just been presented, I rejoice, in be- I
inz able tOHtafc, that there is n star of!
I
hope which has not yet forsaken our po- j
ii'icii! h.in ens, and it is to be found in j
the tendency of Religion to produce Industry,
sobriety. and a spirit of equity,
kindness and forbearance ; and finally the
assurance of the blessing of heaven upon
that nation which cultivates these lovely,
amiable and pious trails of character.?
God has planted His church in our land,
and for her sake, we hope fie will spare
our nation.

That much superstition and folly en.

reverence to a Supreme Power in heaven,

Look at Trance in the days of hex boastcd

implanted in the human constitution

Creator; and ho must do violence to the

humanity, who seeks to obliterate all the

upon the perpetuity of our government.

ail their inuid. He had once made up
his mind to return the b ink bill to
Congress, but he was wilh. g to re-consider
that determ nation. He would accompany
members the next day on a visit to the ship
LMaware [then lying off Annapolis,] he would
dismiss the subject from lis mind, and suffer
no gentlemen lo approach him in regard to it;
on Sunday morning ho wotild go lo church
and say his prayers; and in the afternoon he
wou.d retire to his chamber?-shut out the
world?and carry the whole subjeet to the
throne of grace and direction from on high;
and if af.er that he could bring his conscience
to let him sign the bill, he would sign ?., and
if no*; he prayed Heaven-[here Mr s. voice
became low aud broken, ho put his hands to
his eyes, and what, he said was lost ?.u the Re.
porter. While, however. Mr. M. seemed
thU9 deeply affected, there was a general
laughter throughout the House.J
Mr M. proceeded to say that he then felt
(satisfied the ['resident intended to return the
bill, yot when he saw a big tear standing in
his eye, and heard him epeak of his mental
anguish, no power on earth would have ind?t?

result! Alter the President had dried his
tears, the delegation gave him to understand

him on the matter. They caine there to tell
Imn frankly what thoy believed would be the

forih the injurious consequences which could
not fail to follow."
