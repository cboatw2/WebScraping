THC MISSISSIPPI BONDS.
We publish below pa. of a letter from t
oujj of-our Mississippi fiiends, as the rea- ii
dies* way of satisfying his request. We J
take leave to say, however, that the j\fer f
curp has never been on the side of repU' r
dial ion?a doctrine we utterly abhor and jj
spurn. We have, however, supposed it t
possible that the officers of a State Gov. 1
eminent might so far transcend their *
powers as to involve the community in ^
distressing liabilities, which they-have t
not and never would have authoriied, %
and that when such a case of violation of *
law was clearly made out, the State could ?
not in honesty be held bound to do any 1
tiling more than compel a surrender to d
the .'creditors of whatever remained of *
the proceeds of such deht. We have not (j
decided whether the case of Mississippi v
can be show n to be such, hut we have tried j t
to place before our readers so much of the j 1
history of her debt as has come to our ; ?
knowledge, and we have maintained that j a
the people of that Slate, while acting in j
the sincere belief thai the deht originated t
in a gross violation of their Constitution *
- r+ ?
and was consummated in a breach ol eve. j n
ry conditit n of the statute authorizing it, , f
w*< re most foully and unjustly branded j ?
with tne ep.theU of " swin iters and rob. , *
bers r
We feel bound to say, however, that if j t
we were citrzens of Mississippi, we should , <
muclr- rather pay our proportion of the j J
debt, though it were at the cost of the j
comforts of life, than that the Stale
should he dishonored for even only an
apparent breach of public faith. And j
we acknowledge the fill! force of the ar- |
giiment of our correspondent, that the ( j
-State, by not resisting the fraud sooner, . ,
has, to all appearance, made herself a par- ? i
ty to the'transaction. i
We had read the Message of Gov. MeXutf, |
for a copy of which we should hpfore have
made our acknowledgements to He Evcellency,
and were digappomted in finding that no
now farts had c une to his knowledge resjiect <
ing these Bonds. He say? very little about |
ttiein. but makesone excellent suggestion that; ,
we trust will not be lost on the Legislature? '
that a Committee should be appointed to give
the whole su'ject a thorough sifting, with 1
power to examine witnesses and documents. I
The history of these bonds is involved in the (
deepest tnysterv still?let the veii ho torn <
away and the facts be made Hear. To whom
and on what conditions wi re they originally J
sold ? {few were they disposed of by the U.

From the Charleston Mercury.
We have not had a richer enjoyment
for a very long time, than the perusal of
the January numbers of the Democratic
*nd the Boston Quarterly Reviews. Their
contents cheeringly assure us that the
true doctrines of strict construction will,
not only in name but in fact, share the
triumph they have gained for the great
Republican party of the Union, and by
coming into power with it confirm its ascendancy.
We know not how wo can
bettor at present occupy the editorial
portion of our columns, than with a review
of somo of the leading papers of
these Reviews; and shall commence it
next week. In the meantime wo cannot
resist the temptation of copying from the
Quarterly, the following eloquent and
jtist tribute to Mr. Calhoun :
"We have no intention of going again
into the general meriis of the distribution
policy. In our Journal for April, and
ilso for July-last, we considered it at
length, both in its constitutional b arings
i lid as a question of expediency. Mofe:>vcr,
after the very full discussion the
subject has received in both branches of
Congress, and especially after the masterly
speeches of the distinguished Senator
iroin South Carolina, nothing in fncl
remains for us to say, but to repeat what
others have already said, and better said
than we could say it. It is hard gleanng
fter Mr. Calhoun. Wo have no amjilian
to follow him in the discussion ol
my question relating either to the princi>losof
government, or to its policy. He
istially covers the whole ground ; and
lowever we may be disposed to question
- - n a.
tome of his propositions ai rirsr, we ?re,
or the most part, obliged to surrender to
lim unconditionally at las'. To this sub.
cct of (I i*lri but ion he has had bis ntten.
ion drawn for a long time; and no small
>ortion of his efforts for th3 last t\velve
"^ars have been directed to its defeat. It
bui simple iusfice to him to say, that
to was the first ?f statesmen to see
ind expose its misi'heivour* bearing ; nno
le lins exerted himself, often alone, amid
eproachand obloquy, ?howered upon bim
Vom all quarters, for its defeaf. with a
oresight, a sagacity, a steadiness of prin:iple,
and a firmness of purpose, which
lave won for him a place in every truly
American heart; and the reputation of
?eing the finlt statesman, in the purest
nd loftiest sense of the term, that his
ge or country can boast. The American
icople have great reason to be proud of
l/r. Colhoun, and to cherish a profound
espect for his talents and worth, and a
enJer regard for his fame. With a peronal
character that has passed for years

lieion ; an intellect of the highest order,
nlarged and invigorated by a long life of
ssiduous cultivation ; an unwearied dootion,
from hi* earliest manhood, of
lis best utfoctiiMis and powers to the pubie
service, in high and responsible staions.
to every one of which he has proved
limself equal, and the duties of all of
vhien he has discharged with a fidelity
md success unparalleled in the history of
ny other public man in the country ; a
dear nnri vivid perception o'f justice, and
i m irtyr like firmness of principle, thut
vould lead him to rush in where "blows
all thickest and heaviest," to its support,
in^to brave power, and even the axo of
he executioner in its defence; always
rue to the great principles of law and
irder, and fast friend of the broadest lib.
rty, embracing in his policy the freedom
md well being of lite humblest as well as
he proudest citizen ; unsecured by powr,
unenrrupfed by success, undazzled by
eputntion, he is a man of whom his naive
country may well be permitted to
>oast; for such n man is only the slow
jrowth of ages; and in showing thatsho
inows how to appreciate ami honor him,
lis country inscibcs her name high on
he list of the more advanced nations of
he earth, and proves that she has within
i^rselfj the elements of national greatness
ind immortality.
We have been particularly interested
n thi9 last speech of Mr. Calhoun, on
he Distribution Dili, which we have pla ed?it
the head of this artiele-j-not only
is being one of the ablest of his speeches,
>ut Hs.dc.velop.ing'a, Jiheral patriotic pdlideserving
the sprcial attention of our
?vn bclovxd England. Mr, Cal
t ~ - ' * ^
h'oun proves in this speeoh that he is a
Southern man, with strong affections for
his own section of the Union, and disposed
to resist to the utmost, any,aggression
ori its rights and interests*; but also, that
he studies and embraces in his policy, the
protection and furtherance of the common
rights -and interests of the whole
country.-"
THE EIGHTH WEEK OF THE SESSION.
Has been conusmed, in the Houso of
Representatives, (with the exception of
Saturday,) in proceedings and debates of
such a character asit has given unmixed
pain to be obliged to report to our readers,
upon which, thesubject vet depending, and
we forbear for the present any other remark,
than that the shortest possible way
will, beyond all question, be the best way
in which the subject of debate can be disposed
of.
Much, however, as there has been to
deprecate in the tone and temper of the
debates of one branch of Congress, the
last week has yet been the. most fruitful
of the session. The debate in the S mate,
; for the most part on both sides learned
j And able, terminating, as it did, in a decis|
ion sustaining the Bankrupt Law passed
j at the late Session, was a worthy employ.
; ment of the time of that body, and the is.'
j sue one, in our opinion, corresponding to
the purpose, for which that branch of the
! - a it*t i r>
uovernmenc was established, ot giving a
character of stability and consistency to
the National legislation.
The final passage, in the House of
Representatives, on Saturday, of the bill
, to authorize a reissue of Treasury notes,
to an amount not exceeding five millions
of dollars, is the first step taken by Congress
at this Session towards providing
the ways and means for the support of
Government for the year 1942, ill addition
to such revenue as &e reduced imposts
will yield. Thougfdt is most seriously
to be regretted that some such
measure was not carried through five or
six weeks ago, as it might readily have
been and doubtless would have been had
Congress realized the urgency of the oc
casion for it, it cannot but be a subject of
congratulation among our readers that,
by this measure, the Treasury is restored
to a state of solvency.?Nat. Intell.

Great Casting?One of the immense
hydrostatic cylinders used for raising
vessels by the Screw Dock Company
was cast yesterday at the Novelty Works
of Messrs. Stillman & Co. The cylind
er was 22 feel long, its bore 13 inches,
thickness of shell 9 inches; iron required
22 tons, being by far the largest casting
ever made in this country. The iron
was melted by three cupola furnace* ;
commenced blowing 10 o'clock 6 minute"
iron began to run 10,50; opened runners
at 3, 12; opened sluices for waste metal
at 3.16; time employed for preparing the
mould about four weeks. The predecessor
of this noble cylinder was cast in
f \ *
Scotland and proved defective, and the
Company determined to give their owr
country a chance. It is believed that a

Lord Ashburton.?Your journal is
not accurate in regard to Ashburton. He
is a brother, it is true, of the Baring who
gives his name to the firm of Baring
Brothers Co., but he is not interested
in American stocks to any considerable
i extunt. He some time since retired from
'that firm. That house itself is not intercsted
in American stocks or bonds to
the amount jrou suppose. They have an

'A Mr. War#*), of Alton, Illinois, has

decidedly more brilliant and extensive

Profit of Temperance.?A worthy'

the force of his own convictions, discontinued
the use of intoxicating drinks a
year a go, celebrated the anniversary of
[hisfreedom from a bad habit,by inviting
a few of his friends, one evening last
week, to partake of a clam chowder.
After due discussion of the savory mess
?which formed so important a part of the
sustenance of our pilgrim fathers, and in
praise of which the pen of the latest British
traveller in this country runs riot?the
host opened his desk, and took out a dra.
! war of money. Ho showed his guests
that there were more than a hundred dollars
in the drawer, and informed them
that those were the savings of his "grogmoney"
for the yenr. Every day he huJ
deposited in the drawer the sum he
would previously have spent for liquor,
and this was the result !?Here was, absolutely,
the foundation of a fortune.

its lawful interest, would insure a handsome

On tjie subject of the banks nothng^r^has

taherr together, there never convened a

who achieved less to satisfy the w.
public mind. We hrfrnot, however,din- A

some of thein? of lx>th parties ejutrtodthemselves
manfully to promote
