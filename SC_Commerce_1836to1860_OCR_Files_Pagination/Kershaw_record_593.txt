thare does exist this impcrium iniwpcrio
for the exercise of so important a power
the people of ths State might well ask, up
on what constitutional principle a sover
vign right, which can only be exercised
legitimately by their own Government
has been delegated to agents, politically
irresponsible to them. In such an issue,

improvidenlly lost in law, it would
but too probably, in the absence of any
other resort, be reclaimed by revolution,
The wisdom and propriety of retaining
Some checks and guards, similar to those
which have been proposed, upon the extraordinary
privileges with which this
State has endowed her chartered institu
lions, is, I presume, universally uuiuu>cU,
in reference to those hereafter to be chartered.
Ii will readily however occur to
every reflecting mind, that a prospective
legislation in this respect, could remedy
none of the existing evils.
The Banking Capital of the State is
more than equal to its exigencies and requirements,
and the most of those corporations
in which it has been vested, have
many years tocomplete the term for which
they werechartered. Such a discrimination
with regard to futue and existing insliliu.
tions, would thererfore be as inefficient as
it would be invidious.
If I have a just and proper conception
of the objects of the proposed amendment,
it was with these views anJ conceptions,
that the State thought proper to require
these salutary concessions from her
chartered institutions, to her sovereign
authority and supervision. Deriving extraordinary
privileges and immunities
from her liberality, she has pre-eminent
and irresistible claims upon their confidence
and gratitude. Trusted for a long
course of years, with the exercise of rights
and powers and franchises sovereign in
their nature, and which can appertain to
to none of her citizens individually, she
may well urge a moral, as well as political
right, to be trusted in turn, with a dis-relion.
which she canuot exercise for her
own interest without promoting theirs.?
That she has generously sustained them
in ail past misfortunes and difficulties; is
the highest evidenc of her future kindness
and liberality; und sould be the last
pretext invoked, to sustain either present
or future acts of contumacy. And while
the interests of her citizens are so intimately
connected with their stability and
success, the restraining influence of a just
und enlightened popular feeling, will be
ever ready to interpose, to prevent the
capricious exercise of legislative awthori*
tyro
these high considerations, may perhaps
be added another, of not less practical
importance: that the salutary influence
of r?late authority would perhaps greatly
conduce. Lit times of extraordinary calamity,
to prevent these controversies and dissensions
between the Banks themselves,
which were so unhappily exemplified in
the history of some of our own institutions
during the disastrous even!.* of the lute

- - - ,
< <! a salutary and judicious influence, may
be inferred from the fact, tliat under the
operation of its provisions, the Banks of
this State alone, of all the institutions
South of the Polamac, have ill good faith
and reality met engagements or demand
for specie, without pretext or evasion.
Whatever may have been the motive,
or necessity which induced to the enactment
of this statute, ihe rejection of its
provisions, by some of these institutions,
has made it a question of the gravest import.
from the discussion and decision o
which, this State cannot, without a sacri
flee of her dignity and self-respect, shrink
or recede. In this aspect of the question
I fell constrained, by every sense of duty
as well as of allegiance, to exercise at
the authority with which 1 was entrustec
by the Legislature or the Constitution, t<
enforce the objects of the law througli
the judicial tribunals of the Stale. Will
this view, I deemed it proper to engagi
the services of several of the most effl
cient gentlemen of the Bar, as assistan
counsel, to co-operate with the Attorney
General, and Solicitors. I regarded it a:

their presence and services in Charlcstor
and under such circumstances of iucot
venience, as those tinder which the
would have teen rendered, I could nt
presume officially to request them. Th
arduous duties which would therefore hav
devolved upon the Attorney Genera
could not have been performed, even b
his indefatigable zeal and industry, out
the expense of every other duty and ei
gageinent. And although having evei

0 modfest sense of his own merit.) to be de-1
r volved on the abilities of a single, advoit

r and able efforts with which their rights
and interests have been vindicated, and
t discussed.
In connection with these remarks, xela.
live to the controversy into which this
State lias been so unfortunately drawn, by
the recusancy of some of her Banking inI
stiiutions, it may not be improper forfyou to
, direct your views to tbe consideration of
some permanent and prospective mode, of
regulating our currency. I assume, of
course, that this State can never acquiesce
in the existence of a National CorporaI
tion, or admit the necessity of subjecting
its monetary affairs to the arbitary and
exclusive control of such an institution.
Much of the pressure and difficulty under
which our community has labored, has
arisen from the constraint imposed upon
the operations of our Banking institutions,
by the dissensions, necessarily incident to
an inequality of Banking Capital. There
is probably no fact in the economy of
Banking operations more incontrovertible j
than that the business of a moderate capi-1
tal, tinder ordinary circumstances, is usually
productive of the highest rates of
profits. And if, in our experience, there
exists any exception to this rule, in favor
of the hrge Banking institutions, it is because
the late policy of the Slate, in ere- ,
nting so vast a disproportion of capital as
now exists, has substituted the dominion
of the few, for the honorable competition of i
all, and thereby produced strife and discord,
where nothing but a generous emulation
of profit and usefulness should prevail.
The greatest profits of the Banking system
are presumed to be derived from its
operations in exchanges. In proportion i
to the exorbitancy of the rates produced
by the derangement of the currency, and 1
the pressure and difficulty of the times; i
and in proportion to the advantages of the I
eapital by which an institution may mon- i
opolize that branch of business, so may its i
interest and tendencies be directed to pro- i
tract, and even to increase that State-of
disorder, from which it acquires its great- i
lest trains, it cannot therefore be a wise i
policy which supplies to private corpora- i
lions, ill excessive capital, the power,
motives, and inducements to profit by the
embarrasmenls, or to extort from the ne- i
cessities and inconveniences, of the people.
I do not mean by these general propositions,
to imply a censure on the conduct,
or illustrate the abuses of any one of our
own institutions. The example of one of
them, at least, during the late suspension,
so far from manifesting such a policy, cannot
be too highly commended for its forbearance
in the use of its advantages, as
well as its wisdom and firmness, in maintaining
the faith and credit of the South.?
Still, an undue and dangerous power over
out currency,'is necessarily incident to
the position of financial autocracy which
it occupies. And if that power has not
been tyranically or corruptly used to its
injury, or the detriment of the public, it
has been owing to the discreet forbearance
of those who wielded it, and nut to
any safeguards provided by the laws to restrain
it.

some common and modcrale standard, less
' than that of our Slate institutions, would
probably prevent the recurrence of fu'ure
i evils arising from this case. But in the
mean time, to strengthen the influence of
our Stale Bank, either by an increase of
capital or of immunities, is perhaps at
. present, the most efficacious, and the only
i means of correcting existing ills, which
, legislative action cunnot otherwise reach,
, without violating the charters which sancf
tioned them. Whether this Slate should
. participate in banking operations at all,
f cannot now be rcgurUeU as an open or a
practical question. But whether she
should not use her institution, in the lan|
guage of a distinguished statesman, to "unj
bank" the abuses of the system, is a policy
, that deserves to be well considered. Such
, a position it is presumed the Bank of
i this State would occupy, with a most
> dignified, salutary and judicious effect.?I
. Uertutn it is, in my esumaiiuo, mui du
t long as the Slate engages and competes in
f bunking operations, her institution should
3 at least exercise a controlling influence on
. her monetary affairs; or else present ihe
s strange political anomaly of the public
s Treasury, (with which it is practically
i. identified.) and the people's money, subj.
jected to the capricious and selfish domij.
nation of private corporations which,
ft however benificently exercisetl hereto!
fine, is always liable to abuse. That its
i. present resources arc inadequate to this
y object, is bin loo apparent from the mcon,1
venience anil restrictions, to which, in all
ie times of great pressure and difficulty, it
.e has been subjected.
il, Whether it may not be expedient, in the
iy event of increasing its capital, to associat
ate private interests, which may always
11- exercise a salutary vigilance on its operarv
lions; or, by merging, as their charters
ts expire, the whole banking capital of the
at Stale into one system, proportionately
controlled by the Stockholders and Repts
resentauves of the people, are measures
- - ' *
a g r'*'. \ m
j which I would suggest as worthy of your!
I consideration. Such a system of finance,
if uniformly adopted by the Stales, rejjuI
lated and modified by the influence of a
I national Sub-treasury system, it is believj
ed would furnish the best and soundest
I currency in the world.
The Report of the President of the
Banlc, will apprise you of the profits j
which have accrued from the transactions]
. i
of this institution for the past year; ami j
for a review of the circumstances and em-1
bsrrasments prcvading the community tinder
which they have been realized, you
need not be rcfered to a monitor niorej
faithful than your own experience. Sat
isfeclory as those profits are, considering
the character of the times, they have been
derived from accomodations as benificcut
in their effects, as they have been safely
and judiciously administered, f<>r the benefit
of the institution itself. Without resorting
to any of the usurious expedients
of the limes, its resources have 1 believe'
been as faithfully and humanely directed j
to-protect the property of the citizen, as
patriotically to subserve the interests oft
the State.
From the aspect of the financial affairs
of the Slate, as you will find presented in
the Comptroller's Report, you will perceive
the expediency of exercising the
same rigid and judicious economy, in the
disbursements of the revenue, which has
hitherto prevented the necessity of increased
taxation. Additional burdens upon
the labor and properly of the people,
should not be imposed in times of such :
embarrasmcnt anil distress, except for I
objects of such primary necessity, and im-j
portancc, as affect the permanent weal i
and safety of the Stale, or any ? f the!
great principles of constitutional liberty.j

session, the Treasury is still far front
having obtained a redundant and overflowing
condition. It will be found I
trust however, adequate to meet all such
necessary exigencies, as cannot be neglected
without consequences more ininous,
than the most wasteful and inconsiderate
extravagance.
The condition of the public works and
improvements effected at so much cost to
the Stale?some of which are still unfinished,
other unprofitable, many falling i
into decay?will demand your attention, j
either to abandon, repair, or olhcwise i
dispose of them. The sale or lease of;
many of them, under the supervision of
commissioners appointed in the several
communities in which they arc located; at
u price not less than the value, (as estimated
by the Comptroller or Superintendent,)
would perhaps be one of the most
efficacious and satisfactory modes, of relieving
the Suic'frum further embarrassment
and expense.
The impracticable condition of the road
through Vance's Swamp, and its great
importance, as the ordinary, and I lie- j
lieve, the only channel of intercourse with;
Charleston, to more than three Disiricts I
in this Stale, as well as a large portion of
North Carolina, makes it highly desirable
that the liberal appropriations already
made to improve it, should not be utterly
lost, by the ruinous and incomplete Condilion
in which it now remains. More than
twenty thousand dollars were expended by
the Stale, in constructing the original
road; from which it has derived neither
benefit, or improvement. Ten thousand
dollars was afterwards received by a contraetor,
for erecting the skeleton of a
Bridge which, having been rejected ns
perishable and dangerous, was abandoned
and removed. Of the last appropriation
of twenty thousand dollarrs, to embank
the swamp, the contractor has received
the first instalment,'and after accomplishing
a very considerable portion of the;
work, at a ruinous expense to himself,;
has been compelled to abandon it, from
the exhaustion of his resources, the influence
of recurring freshets, and an inability
to complete a contract so far exceed-;
inor the estimated cost and labor. The!
balance of the appropriation still remains
in the Treasury; and if diverted from the
object first contemplated by the Legist)-'
ture, will.leave the Slate without a single
corresponding benefit, to compensate tor
all the sacrifices of treasure, which have
been so ruinously sustained, by built ,
State and individuals.
No portion of the police or statistics of
of the Slate, is presumed to require more;
radical reform, tlinn our system of Road
working. There is no object upon which
so much labor and expense is so unprofitnbly
bestowed, or so unequally contributed,
by the different classes of society.
Notwithstanding the annual impositions
upon the time, labor, and purses of our
citizens, the condition of our roads is far
from manifesting a corresponding degree j
of improvement. Nor is it less obvious,
that mucli the greater portion of the burden
which the present system devolves
upon the people, is sustained, almost exclusively,
by the agricultural interest.?
The labor or profits of the capitalist, or
of the professions, (110 mutter how productive
or enormous,) are practically exempt
from these assessments, which always
recur, am' which sometimes fall
with much inconvenient force, upon the
interests of the Planter. Nor are the objections
arising from principle, less cogent
than those which are so amply illustrated,
by the experience of its inefficiency and
inequality. The sovereign power of taxing,
even within a limited discretion, the
property and labor of the people, as possessed
by the Board of Cotnmissoners
now established in the several districts of
the State, cari never be safely or' wisely
reposed in any body of men, however
