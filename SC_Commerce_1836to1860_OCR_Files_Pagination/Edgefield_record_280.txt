From Texas.-The arrival of the steam
er Columbia, last night, puts us in posses
sion of news frorn Texas to the 12th inst.
of which the following may he considered
the principal items.
Soume sickness prevailed in Houston.
It was reported that an army of 4000
Mexicans had advanced to Matators.
This intelligence made little impression on
the minds of the Texi'ans, whose attention
was principally turned to the lndiatt frou
tier. A large hody of Texians, regulatrs,
volunteers, and militia, had marched to
the Northern frontier. where it was under
stood Indian parties fromn 20 tribes, were
about to meet them, The result was ex
peeted anxiously. The Texians it was
said, were determined to compel the In
dians to abandon the Northern counties,
and it was thought the savages would give
battle ratherthan consent. We shall not
know tho result. ofthis meeting for somne
weeks.
More than 1000 persons are said to have
already squatted ott the site of the new
capital of Texas on the Colorado; and it
was thought the competition would he very
great at the approachine sale of the lots.
The citizens of Houtston atppear to a ave
lad a very serious brush with the gam
blers.
It is said the cotton crop of Eastern
Texas, will this year fall little short of 20,
000 hales.
Besides the marauding parties of Ca
manches on theWestern frontier, t he trade
bet wen Texas and the cottntry beyond Rio
Grandedel Norte is nowsaid tosuiler from
the depredations of land pirates, or armed
bands of white men, who plunder alike
Mexicans and Texians, when the oppor
tunity offers.
Tie Houston Star of'the 10th inst. says:
"Colenel Karnes arrived in thi- city on1
Saturdav, the Cth inst. from San Atonio.
lie brings no news of particular importance
Patrties of ludians occasionally nake their
appearnuce in the neighborhood of Bexar;
bmtl do comparatively little damage. ex
cept in the way of plinder. It seens; that
the white "land pirates" are much more
troublesome than any of our enemies.
One ofthe worst features in their robieri
es is that they are priincipally confined to
Mexican traders, between whom and our
citizens, Congress, at its last session, at
tempted to encourage trade. They are
by no mneans particular, however-anv
thing in the way of plunder is acceptable.
W e learn that a company is about to be
raised to proceed to the West, to preserve
the citizens and rtaders from further vio
lence."
A REMARKABLE HISTORY.
Zerah Cotburn.-No phenomena in the
whole history of intellectual man, have
been more remarkable tman those attend

has been recently announced.
lie was born at Cabot, Vermont. on the I
lt ol'Septenber. 1804, and was the sixth
child of pour, but respectable parents. Ili,&
father was a farmet, an&e first discover

August, 1810, the boy beingt then about
six vears old. The child had been at a
district school only about six weeks, which
comprised all hisopportunity for education

mon , and examined by distinguished me',
who were astonished at his power. w'hichI
wvas no less incomprehentsibmle to themn
thatr to himnself. By the advice of friends,
hisfather was induced to take Zerah a
bout for exhibition, though several capital
offers w~ere made (especially by Pr febsor'
Adams. of Dartmouth College,) to take
himn in charge and give hitn a complete
education. All thte offers were refused by
the mercenary spirit of the father.
In Boston the father receivted a mttmifi-r
cient otler to educate the boy, which his
mercenary temper indluced hitm to refuse.
Jas. Perkins, Daniel Sargeani, ,Josiah
Qtuitncy, Isaac P. Davis, WVni. Sullivan,r

Zerah was soon taken to England, whecre

the United Kinugdotns, receiving mnch
money, andI borrowing more, this wicked .1
fat her took the boy to France. wihere, itt
1814, without giving any intimnationt of his
natme, prerson, otr character, he was taken
to Dr. Gall. the father orphrenology, who
immnediately remnarked tuponu the promi-t

to make a umask of his face. Hcre, also.
great astonishmnent was excited, anti vast
sums of money taken by the exhibition or

and they returned in poverty and distress
to Enulatnd.
In Jutly, 1816, the Earl of Bristol, wvith
a prineely liberality, took itp the patronage
of the hoy. with the hope that, itt the coursec
of a good education, he might be enabled
to reveal the secret of his mysterious pov.

down by useless particles but has renewed his

This principle of purging wvith Uranudreth's
Pill. removes nothing bi the useemns aid de
cayed particles from the botlv.-thei morbid and
corrupt humors of the blood ; those humors
which cause disease-thev impede the func
tions ofthe liver when they settle upon that
organ. anti which when they settle upon the
nisueles, produce rhenimatisi; or, upol the
nerves prodiee gont; ter. upon the lungs pro

sels, apoplexy and para:yis. and all the train of
disorders so ie'ancholy to the sitferer and all
who behold'them.
Yes pur. :ing these humors fron the body
is the trite enre for all these complaints, anti
every other foirm of disease; this is ito mere
assertion, it is a demons'rable truth. and each
day it is exteniding itself, tar and wide it is be
coming knowi. and amore & tiore a:ppreciated.
