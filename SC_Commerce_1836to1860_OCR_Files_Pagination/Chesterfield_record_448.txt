European Cattle.
The Lower Canada Society for the
Promotion of Agriculture, some time since,
addressed several queries to the Hon. Sir
John Sinclair, Bart, and other distinguished
Agriculturists of Great Britain,
the answers to which have been published
in the Quebec Mercury. We copy those
by Sir John Sinclair, as follows.
Query 1.?What in your opinion is the
most celebrated breed of milch cows,
in Great Britain?
Answer.?The improved dairy cows in
the western counties of Scotland are certainly,
now, the most celebrated and valuable
breed of milch cows in Great Britain,
or any other part of Europe. Such
is the opinion of one who has carefully
inspected all the different breeds of cattle
in Scotland, in many of the counties of
England, as well as on the continent, from
Paris to the Tex el. The cows in Chesshire
are not of a uniform breed, but a
mixture of those in the neighboring counties,
and of Scotch and Irish breeds, all
crossed and blended together. And as
they are not so well fed and treated as the
dairy stock in Scotland, they are inferior ,
to them in general character, and in milking.
The Durham or Teeswater breed
are superior, as dairy cows, to any other
breed in England; and if they were as well
fed and treated as the Scots dairy stock,
tuey would equal them in beauty and
good qualities. The cattle in Holland
have often been mentioned as excellent
dairy cows, but from the quality of their
pasture, and the way they are fed in win
ter, the Dutch cows have strong bones,
coarse shapes, and do not yield so much
milk in proportion to their size, as the
dairy cows in the western counties of Scotland.
For the history, shapes and qualities
of that breed, the Society arc humbly
referred to the account of the Dutch Dairy
Cattle and Husbandry, in the tour through
that country, sent with these answers.
9 Query 2.?What quantity of milk
would a cow of such a breed give per day?
Answer.?There is such diversity in
the quantity of milk, that some cows yield
more than others of the same breed, and
still more in what every cow will give under
various changes of circumstances,
that it is not easy to fix the proper average
of the returns of any breeds. Cows sprung
from the same parents, and reared and
fed together, will often vary considerably
in the quantity of milk they yield. Cows
give less milk when young, or when they
are too old, than they do from four to
eight years of their age. Cows that are
Sean give less milk, and that of an iofcrior
quality, than the same cows will give
when they are in a good habit of body.?
Cows generally give more milk for two or
three months after calving than they do
afterwards. And the manner in which
they are fed and treated has a powerful effect
on the milking of cows.
But without going into particulars, or
mentioning extraordinary returns that
some cows have made, it may be stated,
with entire confidence, that the fair aver
age of the annual returns of milk, given
by thousands of the best of the Ayrshire
dairy cows, when they are in good condition
and well fed, and when they drop
their calves about the end of the month
of April, will be nearly as under.
First 50 days, 12 Scots pts. pr^day 600
Second 50 days, 10 pints or 20 quarts 500
Third do 7 pints per day 350
Fourth do 4 do do 200
Fifth do 4 do do 200
Sixth do 4 do do 150
2000
Some of these cows give still greater returns,
and very many that are of inferior
sizes, or worse fed, do not give near so
much milk as stated above. But the society
may depend upon the fact, that all
the proper dairy cows, when in good
plight, and well supplied with proper food,
* *11 AAAA ixintc /-\V
will, in general, yieia xuuu ot'uu piuio, v/?
4000 quarts of milk every year. And it
is equally certain, that 14 or 15 quarts of
that milk will generally yield 22 or 23
ounces of butter; and that from 55 to 60
pints (110 or 122 quarts ) of that niilk,with
its cream, will yield twenty-four pounds
avoirdupois of full milk cheese.
Query 3.?What would be the price of
: a cow of such a breed from two to three
years old, and in calf?
Answer.?-The prices of milch cows
vary so much from diversity of circum
dQJ
cher!
stances that it is not easy to fix the pric
for any length of time. The scarcity c
fodder from a very dry summer?the fai
ure of pasture herbage from the sam
cause, from the weather being cold an
stormy in the months of May and June
which frequently happens in the change
able climate of Scotland, will sometime
i<wor fhpnrir.fi of milch cows, ten, twenty
V" v. |
or thirty per cent, while a more favorabl
season will raise prices considerably.?
These cattle are twenty or thirty per cent
cheaper in harvest than they are in Ma;
or June. The crops having been abund
ant, and the summers fine for three year
past, the prices of milch cows are consider
ably higher than they have been for sev
eral years before. Some milch cows o
the best sort, and in good condition, hav
been sold as high as ?25; but young cows
from two to three years old, and in call
may be procured of the best sort, at fror
?10 to ?12 each, or still cheaper.
Query 4.?What would be the price o
a bull of the same breed, from eighteei
months to two years old ?
Answer.?Bulls also vary much i:
price. Some of the best ..dairy bulls hav
been sold a#t from ?150 to ?200: whil
one of an ordinary description may fre
quently be procured for ?9 or ?12. 1
would be proper to select a bull for Cana
da about two years old, as the best lookinj
calves frequently alter so tuuch in thei
shapes and character before they come t
maturity, as to render it unsafe to trust t
what they may turn out, until they ar
two years old. The dairy bulls, that havi
mast of a feminine aspect, are preferre*
to those that are most masculine. A dair
bull of good shape and qualities may b<
procured for about ?14 or ?15.
Query 5.?What is the most celebratei
breed of cows in Great Britain, or else
! where, for the production of butter?
Answer.?The quantity of butte
yielded by cows, depends more on tin
food given them, than on any peculiarity
of the breed of cattle; and the quality o
the butter is greatly influenced bv th<
mode of feeding, and still more by the man
f ner in which the butter is manufactured
; Cows that hrowze on natural pasture, 01
what is called old turf, do not yield s<
much milk as the same cows would giv<
when fed on clover, turnips, ctibbagoa, am
new herbage, but the milk of the forme!
is of better quality, and yields more anc
richer butter, from any given quantity ol
milk, than that of cow s fed on clover, die.
Some individual cows of every breed give
richer milk, and of course more butter ir
proportion to their milk, than other cows
of the same breed, and when reared anc
fed in the same manner. Milk, as it comei
from the cows, consits of oily matter
of which butter is made, lactic matter
which forms cheese and serium, or whey
and the milk of particular cows of even
breed differs considerably in the propor
tions it contains of these respective sub
stances. But it is doubtful if any particula
h*> nnintod nut. Unifnrmh
UI LtU lilU li VU<? V?..J
yields more better than any of the othe
breeds, except in so far as they yield mon
milk, or are influenced by climate, tin
mode of feeding, &c. Much butter, an<
that of a superior quality, is made in llol
land, and particularly in the Province o
Freiscland. This seems to proceed frou
the cattle being fed on meadows wher
the herbage is of natural growth, and ver;
rich.?The Cows in Holland give les
milk in proportion to their size, than th
generality of the Scots dairy cows; bu
the milk of Dutch cows is richer than th
other. In Holland the milk is not allowed
to stand more than 18 or 24 hours, tpcas
up cream, while in Scotland, the inferic
cream, which makes inferior butter, is col
lected and churned with the other- Am
above all things, the grea attention paid t
cleanliness in Holland has a powerfu
effect on the quality of their butter.
Query 6.?What quantity of butte
would a cow of such breed produce pc
week?
Answer.?From what has beenalreadi
stated as to the diversity of the quality an
quantity of milk, the society will readil
perceive that it is not easy to answer thi
query on general principles: A cow, kep
by William Cramp, of Lewis, in the coui
ty of Sussex, is mentioned in the fifth an
sixth volumes of the communications t
*'? n 1 4 ? "-? oa Kovinrr virUf
me X)U!iru 01 Agricuiniic, im uu> >ug j >w
ed, in the year 1805,540 pounds avoirdi
pois of butter, in 1807, she gave 67
pounds, and in 1808, the same cow gav
466 pounds, avoirdupois, of butter. Th
Secretary to the Board of Agricultun
mentioned a cow kept by the Rcveren
Mr. Heckett, of Bcckingham, near Ne\i
ark, that yielded nineteen pounds, avoi(
rupois, of butter in one week.?But h
I added, that six, seven, or eight pounds pe
I week were the common returns of com
in that part of England. Mr. Vancouvr
states, in his report of Hampshire, that
cow of inferior size, kept by Anthon
Grave, Symington, yielded from fifteen I
| sixteen pounds, avoirdupois, of butter p(
week, for some part of the season. A co
of the Ayrshire dairy breed, kept by M
White, on land in Lanarkshire, situated i
800 feet of altitude above the level of tli
sea, yielded, for several weeks in summe
1833, sixteen pounds, avoidrupois, of bu
ter per week. And the Rev. Mr. Alpii
j ofSkariing, obtained at the rate of thirtee
i pounds of butter frouj one of his cows tui
j year per week.
But although many such instances <
produce coijld be pointed out, they ai
m
LW, SOU 1H-CAUOLINA,
e far above the ordinary or medium returi
>f of dairy cows. It is certain, howeve
1- that thousauds of the Scots dairy cov
e yield 4,000 quarts of milk in the course c
d one year, as has been mentioned; and
j, is equally certain that sixteen quarts c
s. that milk uniformly yield, on an average
13 24 ounces of butter, so that the averag
r, return of these cows, when of good quail
e ty, in right condition, and properly fee
- is 375 pounds, avoirdupois, of butter, pc

p and by which it can alone be preserved.
A series of questions of long standing
difficult in their adjustment, and import
' ant in their consequences, in which th<
i rights of our citizens and the honor ofth<

the course of a few ?ears, (the most o

is the matter to an early conclusion, I loc
r, | with entire confidence to a prompt an
re 1 satisfactory termination of the negoth
>f tion. Three commissioners were appoii
it ted shortly after the adjournment of Cot
>f gross, under the act of the last session pr<
3, viding for the exploration and survey <
e the line which separates the States <
i- Maine and New Hampshire from the Br
1, tish Provinces; they have been activel
ir employed until their progress was intei
rupted by the inclemency of the seasoi
and will resume their labors as soon a
practicable in the ensuing year.
It is understood that their respectiv
examinations will throw new light upo
the subject in controversy, and serve t
i. remove any erroneous impressions whic
may have been made elsewhere prejudicit
e to the rights of the United States. It wai
. among other reasons, with a view of pre
, venting the embarrassments which, in ou
i. peculiai system of government, imped
i. complicate ncgctiations involving the tei
e ritorial rights of a State, that I thought i
e my duty, as you have been informed on
n previous occasion, to propose to the Britis
a Government, through its minister a
s Washington, that early steps should b
e taken :o adjust the points of difference o
. the lire of boundary from the entrance c
i. Lake Superior to the most northwester
i, point of the Lake cf the Woods, by th
e arbitration of a friendly Power, in confoi
e mity with the seventh article of the treat
. of Ghent. No answer has yet been rt
r turned by the British Government to thi
1 proposition.
t With Austria, France, Prussia, Russi
t and the remaining Powers of Europe, I ar
i happy to inform you our relationscontinu
s to be of the most friendly character. Wit
9 Belgium, a treaty of commerce and navi
i gation, based upon liberal principles of rc
1 ciprocity and equality, was concluded i
. March last, and, having been ratified b
. the Belgian Government, will be duly lai
i, before the Senate. It is a subject of cor
. gratulation that it provides for the satis
f factory adjustment of a long-standin
j question of controversy; thus removin
? the only obstacle which could obstruct th
. friendly and mutually advantageous intei
. course between the two nations. A mes
. senger has been despatched with the Har
3 overian treaty to Berlin, where, accordin
C to stipulation, tho rotifioationo oro to b

to you that, after many delays and diff
, culties, a treaty of commerce and navigi
tion, between the United States and Poi
3 tugal, was concluded and signed at Lisboi
2 on the 26th of August last, by the Pleni
1 ipotentiaries of the two Governments. Il
^ stipulations are founded upon those prir
1 ciples of mutual liberality and advantag
? which the United States have alway
r sought to make the basis of their intei
1 course with foreign Powers, and it is hope
they will tend to foster and strengthei
r the commercial intercourse of the tw

may well congratulate themselves. Au i

13 regarded as an evidence of public prosperi- '
ty, is seldom conducive to the permanent
e welfare of any people; and experience has i
n donronstrated its incompatibility with the J
o salutary action of political institutions <
h like those of the United States. Our sa- <
fest reliance for financial efficiency and I
independence has, on the contrary been 1
'* found to consist in ample resources unenir
cumbered with debt; and, in this respect,
the Federal Government occupies a sin.
gularly fortunate and truly enviable posia
tionh
When I entered upon the discharge of
Lt my official duties in March, 1837, the act
e for the distribution of the surplus revenue
n was in a course of rapid execution. Near>f
ly twenty.eight millions of dollars of the
n public moneys, were, in pursuance of its
e provisions, deposited with the States in
' the months of January, April, and Jul}',
y of that year. In May there occured a
5" general suspension ofspecie payments by
1S the banks, including, with very few exceptions,
those in which the public moneys
were deposited, and upon whose fidelity
e the Government had unfortunately made
h itself dependent for the revenues which
j. had been collected from the People, and
>. were indispensable to the public service. I
u This suspension, and the excesses in s
y banking and commerce out of which it a. I
d rose, and which were greatly aggravated
i- bv its occurence, made ton great extent,
unavailable the principal part of the public
g money then on hand ; suspended the col- 1
g lection of many millions accruing on our
e merchants' bonds ; and greatly reduced
the revenue arising from customs and the
j public lands. These effects have continued
to operate, in various degrees, to the
^ prouonl porioU j and, in addition to the
G decrease in the revenue thus produced,
two and a half millions of duties have been
l. relinquishud by two biennal reductions
r. under the act of 1833, and probably as
i, much more upon the importation of iron
[. for railroads, by special legislation.
Is Whilst such has been our condition for
i. the last four years in relation to revenue,
e we have, during the same period, been <
a subjected to an unavoidable continuance
. of large extraordinary expenses necessan.
d Iy growing out of past transaction?, and
n which could not be immediately arrested
0 without great prejudice to the public inter- i
est. Of these, the charge upon the Treajt
sury, in consequence of the Cherokee
n treaty alone, without adverting to others
i. arising out of Indian treaties, has already
exceeded five millions of dollars ; that for
?r the prosucution of measures for ihe remov>f
al of the Sominole Indians which were
;8 found in progress, has been nearly fourd
teen millions; and the public buildings
s have required the unusual sum of nearly
t. three millious.
d It affords, me, however, great pleasure j
d to be able to say, that, from the com.
>f menncement of this period to the present
i. day, every demand upon the Government,
3. at home or abroad, has been promptly
met. This has been done, not only with-1
e out creating a permanent debt, or a resort j
r. to additional taxation in any form, but in j
1 in the midst of a steadily progressive re.
n duction of existing burdens upon the Peon
pie, leaving still a considerable balance
>t of available funds which will remain in
j. the Treasury at the end of the year. The
small amount of Treasury notes, not ex- j
g ceeding four and a half millions of dollars, 1
>t still outstanding, and less by twenty-three
11 millions than the United States have in
1 !l- ? tl- *^~ C5(<1 fno ia or>mnr?<r>rl nf I

n such only as are not yet due, or have not
j. been presented for payment. They may
st be redeemed out of the accruing revenue,
if the expenditures do not exceed the amount
within which they may, it is
te thought, be kept without prejudice to the
is public interest, and the revenue shall
y, prove to be as large as may justly be ann.
ticipatcd.
E); Among the reflections arising from
:n the contemplation of these circumstances,
tn one, not the most gratifying, is the conis
sciou3ness that the Government had the
resolution and the ability to adhere, in
r. every emergency, to the obligations of
ie law; to execute all its contracts according
jrr to the requirements of the Constitution ;
ir. and thus to present, when most needed, a
ur rallying point by which the business of
the whole country might be brought back
a. to a safe and unvarying standard?a reJf)
suit vitally important as well to the inter20
ests as to the morals of the People.?
ti. There can surely now be no difference
ie of opinion in regard to the incalculable
st eviLs that would have arisen if the Govh.

he suffered itself to be deterred from upholdhe
ing the only true standard of value, cither

or the violence of unmerited denunciation.
The manner in which the People
sustained the performance of tbkduty
was highly honorable to their fortitude
and patriotism. It cannot fail to stirau.
late their agents to adhere, under ail
circumstances, to the line of duty; and
to satisfy them of the safety with which
a course really right, and demanded by *
financial crisis, may, in a community like
ours, he pursued, however apparently severe
its immediate operation.
The policy of the Federal Government,
in extinguishing as rapidly as possible the
national debt, and subsequently in resisting
every temptation to create a new
one, deserves to be regarded in the same
favorable light. Among the many objec;ions
to a national debt, the certain tendency
of public securities to concentrate
lltiraately in the coffers of foreign
jtockholders is one which is in every day
gathering strength. Already have the
resources of many of the States and the
future industry of their citizens been in.
definitely mortgaged to the subjects of
European Governments to the amount of
twelve millions annually to pay the con.
stantly accruing interest on borrowed
money?a sum exceeding half the ordina.
ry revenues of the whole United States.
The pretext which this relation afftrds
to foreigners to scrutinize the manage,
ment of our domestic affairs, if not actu.
illy to intermeddle with them, presents a
subject for earnest attention, not to say
of serious alarm. Fortunately the Fede.
ral Government, with the exception of an
obligation entered into in behalf of the
District of Columbia, which must soob
be discharged, is wholly exempt from any
such embarrassment. It is also, as is believed,
the only Government which, having
fully and faithfully paid all its creditors,
ha9 also relieved itself entirely
from debt. To maintain a distinction so
desirable, and so honorable to our national
character, should be an object of earnest
solicitude.
Never should a free people, if it be
possible to avoid it, expose themselves ta
the necessity of having to treat of the
peacp, the honor, or the safety of the
Republic, with the Governments of foreign
creditors, who, however well disposed
they may be to cultivate with us, in general,
friendly relations, are nevertheless, by
the law of their own condition, made
hostile to the success and permanency of
political institutions like ours. Most
humiliating may be the embarrassments
consequent upon such a condition.?
Another objection, scarcely less formidable,
to the commencement of a new debt,
is its inevitable tendency to increase in
magnitude, and to foster national ex ravagance.
He has been an unprofitable
observer of events who needs at this day
to be admonished of the difficulties which
a Government, habitually dependent on
loans to sustain its ordinary expenditures,
has to encounter in resisting the influences
constantly exerted in favor of additional
loans, by capitalists, who enrich
themselves by Government securities for
amounts much exceeding the money they
actually advance?a prolific source of
individual aggrandizement in all borrow,
ing countries; by stockholders, who seek
their gains in the rise and fall of Public
stocks; and by the selfish importunities
of applicants tor appropriations for works
avowedly for the accommodation of the
Public, but the real objects of which are
too frequently, tlfe advancement of private
interests. The known necessity
which so many of the States will be under
to impose taxes for the payment of the
interest on their debts, furnishes an ad??
ditional and very cogent reason why the
Federal Government should refrain from
creating a national debt, by which the
People would be exposed to double taxation
for a similar object. We possess
within ourselves ample resources for every
emergency ; and we may be quite sure
that our citizens, in no future exigency,

ment with all the means asked for the
defence of the country. In time of peace
there can at all events, be no justification
for the creation of a permanent debt by the
Federal Government, its limited range
of constitutional duties may certainly,
under such circumstances, be performed
without such a resort, ft has, it is seen,
been avoided during four years of greater
fiscal difficulties than have existed in a
sim lar period since the adoption of the
Constitution, and one also remarkable for
the occurrence of extraordinary causes of
expenditures.
But, to accomplish so desirable an object,
two things are indispensable; first,
that the action of the Federal Govern
ment, be kept within the boundaries prescribed
by its founders ; and, secondly,
that all appropriations for objects admitted
to be constitutional, and the expend:*
tare of them also, be subjected to a
standard of rigid but wcii-considered and.
practical economy. The first depends
chiefly pa the people themsehres, the
opinions they form of tho true construe,
