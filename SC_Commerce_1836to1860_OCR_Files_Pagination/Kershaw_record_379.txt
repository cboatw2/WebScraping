Chemical Manufacture of Vinegar.?
The simple and beautiful process by which
the Germans supply themselves plentifully
with vinegar, is described as follows,
by Dr. Ure: under a large case, which,
for experimental purposes, may be made
of glass, several saucer-shaped dishes of
pottery or wood, are to be placed in rows
upon shelves, over each other, a few inches
apart. A portion of the black platina
powder, moistened, being suspended over
each dish, let as much vinous spirits be put
into them as the oxygen of the included
kn o/lnnnoto fr? ariJifv. This
-ttil Sllttii uu auv\|uuw %w ??w.- m"mj *
quantity may be inferred trom the fact
that 1,000 cabic inches of air can oxygen110
grains of absolute alcohol, converting
them into 122 grains of absolute acetic
acid and 64 1-2 grains of water. The
above simple apparatus is to be set in a
light place, (in sunshine if convenient) at
a temperature of from 68 to 86 Farh.,
and the evaporation of the alcohol is to
be promoted by hanging several leaves of
porous paper in the cases, with the bottom
edges dipped in the spirit. In the j
course of a few minutes a most interesting
phenomenon will be perceived. The mutual
action of the platina and alcohol will
be displayed; by an increase of temperature,
ana a generation of acid vapours,
which, condensingon the sides of the glass
case, trickle in streams to the bottom.?
Tills striking transformation continues till
all the oxygen of the air be consumed.?
If we wish then to renew the process, we
must open the case for a little and replenish
the air. With a box of twelve cubic
feet in capacity, and with a provision of
seven or eight ounces of platina powder,
We can, in the course of a day, convert
one pound of alcohol into pure acetic acid,
fit for pvprv nnroose. culinary and chemi
. y. * cal. With from 20 to< 30 pounds of the 1
i . platina powder (which does not waste,) we
jnay transform, daily, 300 pounds of best
spirits into the finest vinegar. This may
be regarded as one of the greatest triumphs
of chemistry, where Art nas rivalled Na- 1
ture in one of her most mysterious operations."
Latest from the Mormons.?It is known
that these people, since their dispersion in
Missouri, have collected in great numbers
in and around Commerce, in this State, on
the Mississippi river. The name of Commerce,
as we have heretofore stated, they

or Egyptian, though of the signification of
the term we are ignorant. They hold two

A HORRIBLE SCENE.
Mrs. Lucretia Thompson, a woman of
thirty years of age, left her residence on
Saturday morning last, in search of her
cow; and near night, her absence created
some surprise, ana search was made which
?!! Tnodnv P.TOnincr, when
>TOO aVUV U|/ V?* ? *?VM?ny ?F
her body was found about a half a mile
from the house all mangled to pieces by
the pr&irie wolves and the hogs. A hog
was eating at the body when found. She
lived about ten miles up the North Branch,
between the river and the lake.
Since the above was in type we have
seen the coroner, just from the scene, who
describes one of tne most hornble murders
we have ever heard of. He found clubs
covered with brains and hair, ami marks
on the ground of a scuffle over a distance of
00 paces. It appeared as if the woman
was running to wards home, and would ocj
casionally stop to fteht. Something like a
a dozen clubs were found near the premises.
Her back was broke and her scull stovo all
to pieces.
A single man by the name of Stone, an
Irishman, about 30 years of age, has been
taken to our jail, on suspicion, whose shantee
was not far from the scene. He was
absent on Sunday, on pretence of choping,
and lost hia cap, which he found on Mon
day near the scene, according to ms own
account. Apiece of his shirt sleeve was
found. And when asked for that shirt and
the pantaloons he wore on Sunday, he
said he had burnt them because they were
lousy.
There is a bruise on his arm. One of
the woman's shoes was found near by. It
appears that she run some distance after
blood was shed, and that she must have
been a match for him for some time. No
other object butadultery could have prompted
-this act.
From the Goorgia Argus;
GENERAL HARRISON.
The claims of Gen. Harrison upon the
people of the South have been strongly,
urged, on account of his having sacrificed
-himself by his vote on the Missouri question.
We think we shall be able to satisfy our
J I ?tin moir rln_
readers, mai iwwcyw iuuui 1IW I1JUJ I
serve for having done his duty, that we at
least owe him nothing for his own sufferings,
in that particular case. It will be
recollected, that the vote which his friends
claim for him was given in 1819, and they
go on to say, that ne was in 1822 beaten
lor Congress on account of that vote. Let
us see how this matter stands. He was
elected to Congress in 1816, and took His 1
seat in December 1817; the time for which
he was electod, expired 4th of March 1819,
ia February 1819, he gave the vote of
which his Southern friends boast so much;
the impression exists in the minds of a
great many men, that he was turned out
of Congress for that vote. Let us see?by
reference to Nileg' Register, vol. 2, New 1
Series, page 391, date 1st August 1818, I
we find the following?"General Harrison I
? Ml . I J
has announced that ne win not ou a can*
didate for Congress at the next election." '
In vol. 3, page 175,"dated 7th Nov. 1818, J
we find the following? " Ohio?We have
not yet received the complete returns, but (
it is believed that Ethan Allen Brown is
elected Governor, and for Congress, Thos. ,
R. Ross, vice Gen, Harrison retired."? (
Now, General Harrison gave his vote in i
Februaiy, 1819, and so far from his having i
been turned out of Congress on this ac- I
count, he had declined a re-election and I
his successor had been elected long before I
the vote was given. Missouri was admit- 1
ted into the Union in 1820; whether Gen. 1
H. would have voted against the restriction
at that time had he been in Congress, 1
we shall hereafter see.
Lest however, these things shall be dc- :
nied by the Harrison men, we shall adsli.no

jccf. In a pamphlet headed, "Please read
and circulate,-" and entitled "A sketch of
the life and public services of Gen. William
H. Harrison; we find it stated, that
"in 1816, he was elected by a large majority
a member of the House of Representatives
in Congress from Ohio. In this
station, he served to his own honor and to
the -satisfaction of his constituents, until
1819; when upon the expiration of his term
of service, he was chosen to the Senate of
tlio State Legislature." Mark it?"He
served to his own honor and the. satisfaction
of his constituents;" and yet he was
beaten .in 1822, on account of that vote;
but as farther evidence that" he served to
the satisfaction of his constituents," he was
the 8ameyear elected to the Senate of his
own State. .

not serve to the satisfaction of his constituents,
but that so much were they dissatisfied,
and so implacable was their spirit
of revenge, that more than three years
afterwards, he was beaten for Congress
on account of his vote; and yet so forgiving
are the same people that in 1824, as a
compensating for his former defeat, they
elected him to a seat in the Senate of tho
United States.?Facts are coming to light,
notwithstanding the old General refuses
to be a witness. The old- man's friends
arc not all that have been ignorant of his
history; but there are those who will take
rather more pains to make it known than
they will. We have in our possession a
good many of the old man's opinions, and
we shall give them to the world.

From the St. Augustine News, May 0.
Indian Fijiit.?Capt. Rains, of the
7th Infantry, is in command of Fort King,
and with the most laudable ambition of
doing effective service, has been actively
employed in efforts at the destruction of
the enemy. But a short time since, some
..f k;<* mah lvni-A billpft nc lhpv left l!lC
garrison; and he determined on placing
shells under cover of a blanket, in the
hope that their rupidity might induce them
to appropriate the articles, and thus fire
the fuse, sending death among them.?
During the night, he heard an explosion,
and on repairing to the spot in the morning,
with eighteen men, he discovered
tracks of blood and scattered clothing, as
well as poney tracks. Suddenly he was
surrounded by a galling fire, whilst the
woods were resounding the war cry of ilic
enemy. Capt. Rains immediately charged
upon the Indians, who took their shelter
among trees, and continued the discharge
of rifles at his little band. The fight was
kept up with great spirit, until the leader
of the enemy, Alectustenugge, fell; when
he was immediately borne oil' and the Indians
retreated. Capt. Rains was mortal
ly wounded by the Chief'?when the command
devolved on Sergeant Jackson, who
behaved in the most gallant manner, and
revenged the fall of his Captain, by shooting
Alectustenugge, after being severcly
wounded himself. The loss of the whites
was 2 killed and 3 wounded?that of the
enemy, 4 killed. The enemy numbered
03. We look upon this as the most brilliant
affair occuring during the whole war;
whether we consider the noble daring of
this handful of men in sustaining sucii an
unequal conflict, the loss of the enemy,
and the gallant arid praiseworthy conduct
of Sergeant Jackson. It will lose us,
probably, Capt. Rains; a man distinguished
for his scientific attainments, patriotism
and virtue; whose active exertions in
Florida, thus early close a life of great
usefulness, and adds another martyr to
the calls of duty. ,
Mutiny at Pilatka.?During the last
week the highest offence known on Military
Law, occurred at Pilatka. It appears
that the commanding officer of the
post, Brevet Major Ashby, was absent,

rill. Some order was issued to a noncommissioned
officer respecting the removal
of prisoners, who peremptorily refused
to carry it out. The Company was
ordered to paraded, and this they refused
?Lieut. Merrill at this lime being subjected
to personal violence. Dr. Hitchcock
succeeded ia knocking down several of
the mutineers, and something like order
was restored, although not before a carbine
was levelled at the door and missed
fire. An offence of..this character, wc
believe perfectly anomalous in the history
of the war. Isolated cases of riisobcdi*
ence and mutiny have occurred; hut for n
whole Company to be affected with a simultaneous
spirit of insubordination, is
truly remarkable. The interests of the
service require, in this matter, the closest
scrutiny; such as will devolve the causes
which have prompted this violation of
Military Law, and strike by the terror of
its punishment the repetition of an act,
subversive of all discipline and command.
In an examination, there may be a derelopement
assigning at least .the motive inHuencin?
men to auch a violation of duty.
Should it be found that there is an exercise
of authority inconsistent with law,
ind an abuse of power irreconcilable with
the security of life or limb?that the generous
feelings of the Soldier are trodden
lown into the dust, and subjected to blows
and stripes, as it may suit the arbitrary
>vill?then let the evil .be bared forth, and
ts remedy be appliecd by immediate
change. This act of mutiny is a severe
cfience, and we do trust that the supremacy
of the law will be maintained.?Ibid.

continued roar of winds; as it came On
swiftly and with the speed of the wind,
it was met by another, which was wafted
from directly the opposite point of the
compass. A description of the sublime
spectacle which ensued, is beyond the
power of language to convey. At the
moment of the concussion, large masses
of seeming white spray was precipited to
fheearth, followed by the roaring of the
wind as if old dolus was there guiding
ami directing the storm: Houses were
dismantled#of their roofi, and then almost
'immediately levelled to the earth. The
lair was filled with bricks and large pieces
of timber, and even large ox curts were
uplifted and thrown hundreds of yards
from their original position,
j Aboat sixty flatboats lying in port were
i driven from the shore and sunk. The
ferry boat plying between Natchez and
the opposite shore, was capsized and sunk,
and every one on board is supposed to
j have perished. The steamboat Hinds was
capsized and sunk?crew all lust. The
steamer Prairiehud her cabin entirely taken
off; crew nearly all lost. The two hotels
in the city were shook, one partly, the
other entirely to the ground. Almost eve
ry house was more or less injured. It is
impossible to tell how mtjny were killed,
as the streets were filled with large piles
of timber, rendering them impassable, and
the work of extracting the bodies from
the fallen houses were not completed
when the Vicksburg left; some fifteen or
twenty bodies had been found. It was
! very difficult to find a landing, as every
house under the Hill, except five or six,
was blown down, and the river filled with
floating fragments of houses and boats,
i The tornado in leaving Natchez, followed
the course of the riter about 8 miles
! down to the coast. The court house in
Vidalia was levelled to the ground, and
the parish judge killed. The trees on the
opposite side of the river, as well as those
of Natchez Island, were all torn up by
j the roots or deprived of their branches,
i The damage done to the crops was very
eevae, some plantations were deprived of
all their fences, and others had every cabin
taken away by the storm.?JV<cw Orleans
Bulletin,. May 8DISGRACEFUL
OUTRAGE.
An act of llie most outrageous and high!
handed character, which has ever disgraced
the annals of political warfare, has been
recently perpetrated in Mobile.?The
Democratic Parly of the city held a meeting
at the Court-house on the night of
the 25th ult, for the purpose of celebrating
the late triumph of their friends in the
New-York city election. Appropriate resolutions
were passed, and the meeting
adjourned at about half past 10 o'clock.
J On the following Monday morning the
j chairman of the meeting, Col. WM. It.
Halletf, and^rM. Charles Cullum, a gentleman
who was present and participated in
its proceedings, were arrested under a
j warrant from tho Recorder, for alleged "
i riotous and disorderly conduct." ''That
conduct (says the Register) was the presiding
and being at one of the most respectable
meetings ever held in Mobile."
That the reader may have a clue to the
motive for this gross attack upon the rights
nf mif citizens, it mav be Droner to remark.
that ihc Whigs succeeded a few weeks
since for city officers ; and these new dignitaries
have embarccd the earliest opportunity
of showing the power with which
they have been invested.?They seem determined
not only to conduct their affairs
upon Whig principles, but to deny to all
who do not maintain their creed, the poor
privilege of expressing their opinions! it
may well be asked, is this the spirit which
is to pervade Harrison Whiggery ? Is
lhi3 the regard which modern Whigs intend
to pay to that .provision of the Constitution
under which we live, which au!
thorises the people peaceably to assembly
, for the interchange and-expression of their
! opinions ??Are the mouths of Democratic
: citizens to be muzzled and their persons
I confined ? Is the gag to be applied, to all
J who will tmt bow the knee in humble
! servility before the power which is attcmp|
ted to be created by all the factions that
now oppose our Federal Administration?
Is.this the freedom which Harrisonism
' would bring us ? We hope that all Whigs
| are not actuated by the same feelings that
j are'developed by the city authorities of
j Mobile; and we contidenuy irusi inateven
there, many may be found who uill boicj:
Jy discountenance the tyranny and despoj
tism of their leaders. For the honor of
j the city, the stain which has come upon it
j through the mal-administrotion of its ofii,
cers, should be wiped away by their prompt
| ejection from stations they klisgrace.
| Wc notice with pride and p'easurr, that
the Demo'cracy of the city again assembled
on the 27t?i, and denounced this "unlawful
interference and invasion of liberty," in i
language of such honest indignation as the ,
occasion demanded. They seem to know j
their rights, and determined as they are to,
vindicate 'Jiem under the sanction of the j
laws, they will acquire a moral force which
their persecutors will be unable to resist.

upon "Education," " The character and condition of

it cau 1x3 accounted for on no other ground than thaf
