Loss OP LIFE IN BATTLE. The follow- ('
ing is a general estimate of the losses
sustained hv the English nrmv under the
command of Lord Wellington, from the ^
lime of his appointment to it, in Portugal,
until pi-ace. In the campaign of 1808,
30 officers 1,015 men fell; in 1800, 242
officers, and 4, 688 men; 1810,78 officers,
iiid 624 men, 1811, 429 officers, and Is
S,284 men; 1712, 816 officeYf; and 11,030 g
men; 1813, 1,025 officers, and 14,966 men; d
1814, 400 officers, and 4,791 men; 1815, it
717 officers, and 0,585 men. Total 3,805 ai
officers and 54, 283 men kille^ or woun- r<
ded. This total does not include the si
Brunswickers, Hanoverians, Portuguese g
nor Spaniards. It is remarkable, that at si
Salamanca the proportion of the killed p
to the combatants was one to ninety; at f<
Victoria, 1 to 74 & Waterloo, 1 to 40;
irhile at the battle the Nile, the ratio]
ras 1 to 36; at Trafalgar, I to 40; at
Copenhagen, .
Scriptural anagram.?The extraorlinary
anagram on a passage in St. John,
a much less known Utah it merits. No
louhl there may be many even of our
iwn readers who have never seen it. It
s founded on John xiriii. 39. To the
luestion of Pilate, What is truth? which,
n Latin, runs Quid esi veritasl the leters
transposed, form the just&st and best
lossible answer, and th'e inquirer did
iot think fit to wait for any other:
iz?Est vir qui adesttt i. e.?It is the
ran who is present. The anagram is ren>
lered the more remarkable by the first
irord* uttered by our Saviour, after thh
[tifstion', being (see ch. xix. v. 5;) Behold

A Curious Fact ia^ mentioned in the
tostun Medical and ^urgi^al Journal. It
j there staled tnat notwithstanding the
Tightness of the sky and the pruv? rbial
alubriiy of the atmosphere at St. Croix,
here is one peculiarity which has never
cen satisfactorily explained. This is the
endency to lockjaw, which men, women,
hildren and animals participate in alike,
'his fact is teferred to in Dr. Tuckerlan's
recent letter in the Journal, and is
o notorious amongst the planters "that it
ias ceased to be a matter of wonder. ''It
arms," says the editor, " a curious subeel
for medical pilosophizing, how it haptens
that slight wounds bru'Ses and conunions,
resulting froin the most common
ind ordinary circumstances, are frequenty
followed by an intense rigidity of the
naxillary muscles, which scarcely relax
n death. Tit ere is good authority for
issprting that the domestic animals are
qually liable t?? the sante malady, iliottgli,
vhen young, they seem less pre-disposed
halt in adult age. *
Those conversant with the domestic
mndilion of the inhabitants of St. Croix,
ire familiar with the general custom of
Irinking rain water, which is not always
?f the purest kind, being sometimes exremely
offensive from being kept a long
ime, daring continued droughts, in woodn
tanks. Those who can atlord the ex
reuse, are carenil 10 niter that which they
Irink, through stone, but the laborers
ave no such preparation, anil they are
bviously the greatest suft'erers from locki\v.
No mention has been made of a
imilar pre-dispOMtion to the disease in

eological appealanco is very similar."
Maxims for young Merchants.
1 Do not, like a foolish mariner, always
alculate upon fair weather; hut be preared,
at all limes, for mercantile squalls
nd gales.
2. If you form a co-partnership, silent
r avowed, do not advertise it until the
npital is actually paid in. |
3 Always have articles of co-partnerliip
written by a lawyer of integrity, and
igned and sealed before you commence
usiness.
4 If you buy and sell oil credit, it is
ot safe to sell more in a year than live
mes your actual capital. [When your
si ;it is well established you may exceed
!?* ]
5 Never sell to a man when you have
-LU .1 ? - *
sasoiiauie uuuuis udoui I.is ability to pay
t the time.
0 Nevei sell on credit to a d.unkard,
orsc-racer, gambler; or a man not edufiled
as a merchant.
7 Never sell on a credit to a rhan who
a* not paid former purchases, if due.
8 Select a store the best situated for
our business, even if the rent be high,
rovided it is not extravagantly so.
9 Do hot marry under twenty-five, and
one but a well educated, prudent, noise?ss
woman?one that can earn as much
s she spends.
10 Let not your house rent be more
tan a fifth of the amount you are willing
> expend in family and personal expeh?s.
11 Keep a regular set of books by
ouble-cntry ; and have them posted up
nd examined at least every month.
12 Take an account of stock, balance
our books, and settle all your accounts
vice a year il practicable; always once

in 1704. One of the party, a woman
of 86 years, the mother of the rest,
is grand-daughter of Eunice. They are
of the St. Francis tribe from Canada, and
have been absent from home nearly a

Narrative of an Atrial Voyage from Fair
Mount, Halliinorc.
I must be permitted to prelude this
hasty sketch with a defensive remark
against any imputation which might he
thrown out on a seeming departure from
the more delicate duties apperiaining to
n.v sex. Chance having made me repeat
edh' a witness of aeronautic displays both
in this country and Europe, I imbibc?' an |
aident desire to participate in the plea-j
eiiPus ivhir>t) 1" ''
- v.i.v.i iu me; jircuiiar to
such a mode of travel ; I wished to I iok
down upon our fair earth from such an
eminence as this means only could command?you
may say it was curiosity if
you will, for that is said to be a characteristic
of our sex ; however, in this instance
I trust it was a pardonable one.
An opportunity offered for the fulfilment
?f ",y long rherislnd design in the fall
of '36 when I contemplated a journey to
the skies; but one of those accidents
against which it was impossible to provide
frustrated my hopes?the balloon burst
almost the instant of mv intended departure.
Mortified at such a result and convinced
that the multitude without the gates
was highly incensed, I determined it
should not he fdr the want of an importunate
appeal, if I did not avail myself of
the first opportunity to gratify my own
desires and convince my friends that my
intentions were sincere though doubtful
of my success. This opportunity did not
occur until Thursday last, which day Mr.
Miti'hptl hn?l nnnninln/t 5
...... .|.|>.....vm ><> an n.-M I'llSKMI.
The drfV was fair. the atmosphere scarcely
moved by a breeze, and but a few fleecy
clouds cheeked the face of the sky The
balloon was partly inflated when I requested
Mr. Mitchell to allow me to take his
place: he was incredulous?I assured him
I was in earnest, and after much solicitation
he consented to leave the point to
the decision of the assemblage. The dissentient
voices, (if any) were lost in the
shouts of assent and the car being attached
I prepared for the voyage.
At about 20 minutes before 5 oVIock the
cord was severed and the balloon arose to
the height of about 100 feet. Elated with
the novelty of my situation, I failed to
{perceive that I was descending, till on a
level with the top of the Medical College,
| when I attempted to cast out bullast, but
| too late to avoid coming to the earth, and
the car presently rested on a clothes line
in n lot adjacent to the enclosure whence
11 departed. I now deprived myself of
the barometer and thermometer and a
quantity of ballast retaining but 25 lbs.
for the emergencies of the expedition ;
and desiring the gentlemen to release the
ear, the balloon moderately ascended and
was borne in a direction almost central
over the city.
At a height of about 4000 feet I attempted
to liberate a pigeon which had so far
.been mv compagnon du voyage, but the
k:-.I ? ?
..no prvuicu rt-iuciBiii 10 part company
; it perched on the hoop and gazed
w ith apparent consternation into the abyss
! below. I took it again in my hands ana
cast it into the air. It fell like a stone
and I have heen since informed by those
who perceived it, that the bird appeared
to have lost its self possession till within
soire 300 or 400 feet of the earth when it
made use of its wings to some purpose;
for to keep out of such a scrape in future
it has not been seen at its old quarters
since
I was how nl >ne beyond the reach of
the world, its pr.iisrs or rebuke, and I
determined to " see what was to be seen.**
testing out more hallast, the balloon rose
rapidly and presently encountered a current
of air which carried me over Federal
Hill, and now reclining ujmui the edge of
the car, 1 enjoyed in no ordinary degree
the splendor of that inmitable scene sketched
in skilful miniature below, yet gorgeously
sublime in the magnitude of its
excess.
The city had dwindled into Lilliputian
iliim nci.i.io ""'I ' <" - ?-* ? -
........,,o mill uir niii(>llllllCttirR WHICH 1
had lately left seemed to occupy at least
five square feet. I could perceive that
it was deserted; turning to look from
the other side iti an instant a film came
<?ver my eyes; I rubbed them but to no
purpose; I could see nothing but the oar
and its coh'euls and hear nothing but the
rustling of the balloon as it seemed to
struggle with some invisible antagonist in
upper air. \ moment*? reflection taught
me that I was enveloped i.i a cloud, from
the. feathery edge of which I emerged just
as I became aware of my situation and
again that picture of the fair and lovely
earth from which I had isolated myself
burst upon my view, beautiful in its indistine
minuteness 10.000 feet below the point
fro in which 1 gazed. I now felt the
breeze increase and as I still rose it became
more southerly and 1 crossed the
basin, passing over Fort McHenry to the
Lazaretto, continuing that course for about
fifteen miles unconsc o is ??f any incident
worth recording when a slig t hissing in
|the air made me start to my feet?it increased,
and scarcely had 1 secured the
end ot the valve cord in the wicker of the
ear when a flaw of wind struck llie balloon
and its motion became rotary, the
ear careering rather more than was pleasant
in its prompt efforts to follow in its
etherial waltz?it lasted about thirtv o?_
eonds and having become somewhat more
tractable upon referring to the sun I found
he wind c??mi. g from N. W. and knew
that I was rapidly nearing the bay, though
unable to distinguish land from water at
the elevation 1 had attained, which I suppose
was about 20,(100 feet; I therefore
thought it most prudent to retain the gas
(as I had now no ballast to dispose of but
the grapnels,) till 1 considered it probable
that 1 had gained sufficient upon the
opposite shore of the Bay to allow for
the action of the easterly breeze I conjectured
would be blowing rather brisk,
near the earth. I was fortunate in the
calculation I had n>ad? , On upon discharging
gas my descent was n< t so rapid but
that I was carried due West for the last
fifteen minutes of my voyage over a narrow
strip of wood land; in which the anchor
secured itself at about ten minutes
after 6 o'clock ; in this situation I was
observed by a negro who v as as he said,
in uonrxh ' - L!_ * *
... wis sirmc uig ung uai ne seen
light ? n ile tree-/*
Perceiving me as I leaned from the car
about t? a*k his aid, he exclaimed " Gorry
eighty, if dere haint a wax figger in de
b'loon, may 1 nebher.** I assured him
that the figure was composed of flesh and
blood, and as he was casting about which
way to help me down a number of gentle nen
had come up to whose courteous assistance
I am deeply indebted for the facility
of my descent and the complete security
of the balloon and its appendages;
effected by the promptness with which
several trees were felled by the negroes
at the suggestion of the proprietor.
The spot where I alighted was on thn
property of the late Benjamin Ricaud,
Rsq. of Baltimore in the vicinity of Chegtertown,
K?*nt County, about B miles from
Rock H.?ll and 2 from the shores of the
Chesapeake Bay.
In concluding this lengthened statement
I would avail myself of the opportunity
to return my sincere thanks to the hospila'
e inhabitants of that vicinity for their
kind mention, and also to Capt. Kenny
|of the steamboat Gov Wolcott for a picaleant
passage home. JAHEW4BREN
