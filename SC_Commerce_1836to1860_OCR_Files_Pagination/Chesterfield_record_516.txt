The first officers hold their offices until the 1
next annual meeting, which should be held
at the capital of that State which had furnished
the greatest number of members at the
time when the President of the society should
i-uue h 8 proclamation to convene the second
meeting. |
'J'he place of each'annual meeting should he
fixed at the preceding one, in some other state
than'ho one where it w is then held, so as to
give the members in each slate an easier opj??rtunify
of attending.
As in the formation of all such associations
it is n?ctMsary to have some cash funds, are
you willing to douale "a tnite" to Accomplish
this great n.tional object]
If so, an opportunity will hereafter he offered
you to do so. Uoen some of you I hope to
make a personal ca?i for that purpose, should |
it be thought advisable, after due reflection,
fo g ve this subject your serious consideration.
*
If you should aid in the f rmation of this
society, will not your children "rise up and bless
you ?" For one of the first objects of the Na.
ti n<il Agricultural Society should be to coniiect
with ii a -National Agricultural School."
Not surh a " National School" as is tj^e
only one we now have, which has. with too
much truth, been called rfa nursery of aristocracy"?where
the humble son of a farmer is
^rarely admitted, what is he taught? Not how
to cultivate his mother earth, and make her
wins glad; not how to increase life, but the
art of dest ruction, 'he trade of blood ! ! Such
is now your only national school.
Such will not. be the only one, in a few
short yearn, if you will lend your energies to
form a national society, whose motto will be,
"to elevate the character and standing of the
cultivators of the American soil." For when
once organized, you will soon show a united
force of many thousand, whose voice will be
heard in the halls of Congress, demanding
our hirt bright* Be assured we shall be heard.
"Let all our energies be concentrated, and we
can do any thing in the power of man; but
divided and scattered as we are, we sppud
our forces, a- it were, drop by drop; u hereas,
union would make us mightier than a torrent
We can, shall we sav we will form such a tor.
rent as will over whelm our politicrl rulers, unless
they will do justice to the agricultural
class of the community.
As soon as the National Agricultural Society
is formed, let us ask Congress to appropriate
the "Smithsonian fund" of half a mil ion of
dollars to establish a National School. If
w e unite as we should do, our "torrent" will
be too strong for time-serving politicians to
I look'upon he National Agricultural!
School as the greatest blessing to flow j
irom the National Society.
But the Journal of the Society will also
prove of immense advantage: It will
embody a vast amount of matter, useful
and interesting to every cultivator in the
Union, The most carefully prepared ta-'
hies of the protections of the earth, from
every section of the Union, will he kept
constantly before the reader totally different
from those vehicles of deception, and
often fraud upon the farmer, called " prices
cuWU." It is by the quantity produced,
and the probable demand therefore, that
we can understand whether it is for our
interest to sell our crops now, or store
tnem up. At every meeting there would
be numbers from every state in the Union,
as ready to impart a; receive informotion.
* All the inducements of the business
ol a National Society, a National Fair, i
and a national School," and the honor of
being a member of such a society, would
he enough. I think, to make us all feel
r> (
that it would be a greater honor to he 1
elected a state delegate to one of the annual
meetings of the National Society
than to be elected a member of Congress.
It cannot be expected in this short address,
that 1 should point out all the good
that would How from the action of the
proposed society. But if we are convinced
that the effect would conduce to the
interest and happiness of the great mass 1
ot agriculturist* of the Union, let u.^ act !
and with spirit too.
And now, my friends, one and all, do
you approve of the plan of organization ? j
Speak out holdlv if you do not object, the
leading friends of the measure will fix;
Upon a day for the first meeting, and ,
proceed in the manner proposed.
There has been an argument raised apainst
organizing such a society at pre-j
sent, " because the public mind has not j
been sufficiently instructed, and docs not
sufficiently appreciate the advantages of
such an association to render it successful."
How it is on this very account that the j
friends of the proposed National Society;
w'sh to see it established, that the operations
thereof may wake up an excitement
throughout our 44 wide scattered population,"
that shall be the moving cause of
changing the "condition of the country."
It is ulso argued that the failure of i
several state and county societies is pr^of
that n national one must fail also.
Let me ask if this is a valid argument?
This short quotation, in my mind, is !
sufficient to throw the whole force of
the argument into nonetitv: 44 Divided
and scattered as wc a^e, we spend our
forces as it were,drop by drop, whereas
union would make us mightier than a torrent."
The object of all state and county so
cieties has been of a local nature. Their
existence has been known only in their
own locality, and they have been too
weak in number tc command legislative
aid. Who c-<n tell what would have
been the effects if all he members of the
local societies in the Union had been
attached to one National Society? If
a'l the exertions, of all these societies,
collectively and individually, bad l?een
concentrated upon our ooject, woukf it
not have formed a " torrent as mighty,
comparatively speaking, as the thundering.
Niagara. If the nation, instead of
individuals had received all the light of
the intelligent minds that have been devoted
to these local societies, would it
now be said "that the public mtnd was s<
not sufficiently enlightened to appreciate, d
the advantages to he derived from a Na- a
tional Society?" Kail the money that n
has been devoted44 drop bv drop ' ujx>n i v
44 model farms" and local schools bar'1
been concentrated, should we not have? an J n
institution worthy the great country wy
inhabit ?
If our population is scattered ; if'4 long ^
distance intervene between the most c
cient friends of agricultural improvement/' 1
s^ much the more need of forming such a r
society as shall draw tiiam together in v
44 one strong bond of brotherhood." '
Is it a fact,4 that the time has not yet 1
arrived when such an 'association can be r
orgauized with a reasonable certainty of '
success?" If such is the fact, I am dis. f
appointed in the ch aracter and energy of 1
my countryman. c
Once more I c all upon vou to answer *
me this question; am I so disappointed' *
in vour charmer!
Do not refuse vour countenance to the
measure because it does not originate in x
high places. For 4 if we are ever to have
a National Society of Agriculture, it must J
he got up by the farmers themselves;"
and as one of that class I now address
you.
If the present attempt at organization r
fail the matter sleeps until you and I are
past waking ? ?

PRESENTATION OF THE TTpI'E. J
CANOE FLAG. [
To the President of the United States.
New York, May 1, 1841.
In May lasr, on the Tippecanoe battleground,
in presence of some thirty thous- fi
and people, I .was intrusted by the survu (j
ving soldiers of that memorable field with j
ihefiag that was in the midst and thick- f 1.
est of the strife, which f was commanded 1 j
to take to this commercial metropolis, to
he displayed here, before our fellow-citi- j
aens, as a living, speaking emblem of the
valor of their old commander, ami of the cr
perils he had undergone. When the pol- a,
itical contest was'over, (in which his |
- nnaolinna/t\ anil fK#? I i
courage uou vetii ijuba..v.,VUy
People had seated him as President in the |a
White House at Washington, I was also jj,
to bear it there, and, in the name of his r
fellow-soldiprs, request him to deposit it
among the honored trophies of the Re. j
public. I promised on that ground to ex- aj
ecute this commission, and with an earnest
conviction of coming success?that
the forty-two pounder of the Empire State C(
should herald its arrival there; but in the a1
midst of scenes jo eventful as those of
March, I put off the duty in the hope of a
more quiet day, when, now, alas! there is
thc quiet of the grave ! . a
I see, therefore, no way so proper to a
obey the orders of the brave men of Tip- sr
pecanoe as to lay this flag before you, the q
successor, for whom were the dying in- al
junctions of their illustrious Chief, and!
upon whom his office, and I trust, his spirit J ^
ha9 fallen, with the roquet: that you will1
carry out the wish of his compatriots ir.
arms by depositing it among the rephi* '. ,r)
the Republic. I beg you, in their on ae,; j
most tenderly to cherish it. Ot.u,r f t<tr ' C(
of our countrymen, have no doubt. Ik ..n |
as gallantly defended, and were as gion- sj
ous on land or sea; while they may have t(,
won but a single ship, or a single field, ^
this has the honor of winning whole j ni
States, of conquering empires, inded.? ^
An old Eagle like thir, borne by the pioneersofthe
wilderness, ihnt haw added to m
the reign of liberty and law, become a holy n)
emblem, with its in Jiocsigno pinces upon aj
it. crying out as from the spirit of the
p. st to the future, and which as the coun. 0j
try becomes older ai.d greater becomes jc
to all posterity holier and dearer.
I have th^ honor to be vours. resncctfullv, k,

THE PRESIDENT'S REPLY. J'
To James Br on A s, Esq. C(
Washington, .May 4, 1341. ^
"The flag which was in the midst and a
thickest of the strife," and was commit- ^
ted to your care on the Tippecanoe battie-ground
by the surviving soldiers of I hat
memorable field, and which they com- nj
manded you to bear to this metropolis as c.
an emblem of the valor of their old com- p|
mander and of the perils he had under- n(
gone, has - been delivered into my hands, a
and will be placed by me among the m
honored trophies of the Republic. The
account which was given me some
years ago, by the gallant English, now
no more, who upheld that banner amid
the perils of the fight, had prepared me
to expect to see it as it is, gashed by the A
tomahawk and rent by balls. That En- hf
sign alone, by all the officers, with but ti<
twenty men of the gallant company over ci
which, when the sun went down, fhnt flag hi
so proudly waved, survived to tell in the of
morning the hazards of that terrible night, th
From that brave soldier, who afterwards of
held a high place in the hearts of the o^
people of Indiana, I learned properly to in
appreciate tho fearless bearing and con- ta
duct of the patriotic citizen who has so ei
recently exchanged this earthly taber- of
nacle of clay for one that endureth for in
ever. Death is the common heritage of si
all mankind; so to live but as that the ar
darkness of the grave shall not obscure fc
our names, and that they be placed in ci
close association with the names of the ar
great and good who have gone before and ar
who are to come after us, makes death ac
itself a consummation rather to be wished h?
than fern ad, and throws a light of glory in
over the grave. Such now,"is the convli- w
tion of uthe old commander" into whose' hr
hands, when you received this flag,'you ar
1
3 joyously anticipated its delivery. His
ecds are now''enrolled in the Capital,"
rid this banner shall be preserved a? a
iep?orial of a battle well fought, and of a
ic'-ory most nobly won. ^ I
I p av you, sir, to accept assurances of
r?v great respect. JOHN TYLER.
The bearer of the flag at the battle of
Tippecanoe, alluded to in the above reply
>f the President, some of our readers may
lot recolieet, was Ensign Tipton, a Tenlesseean
by birth, who started from home
nth only his axe for a patrimony, and
vho subsequently became a Senator in
he Congress of the United States, and
me of the first men in Indiana. Of him ,
he anecdote is rarrated, we have seen in
he public journals, where Get;. Harrison
s represented as riding up in the heart
>f the battle, inquiring of the young Tipon,
" Where is your Captain V* " Dead '
ir." " Your Lieutenant Y9 "Dead ! sir."
'Your second Lieutenant?" "Dead ! sir."
'Your Ensign?" "He stands before you!"
vhere Tipton then stood, holdingand cle.
ending this very flag, but so covered with
lirt anu so besmeared with, blood that
Jen. Harrison scarcely knew him.
Hold on," said Harrison "for a moment
anger;" "I will reinforce you;" and he
ode off and led up there the ^ompany of
?apf. Robb;'by which time, or soon after,

anthon's classical dictionary.
The incessant devotion of Professor
nthon to the cause of classical literature
is been already evinced by his publicaon
of a series (not completed) of the anent
Greek and, Roman classic authors;
s ability and fidel ty, in the execution
' the arduous task, have he#?n tested by
e almost universal use of his editions
* the classics in the seminaries of our
vn country, and their general adoption
t the most eminent schools of Great Briin
and Ireland, as well as by the warm
llogies bestowed upon his lnbors by some
' the most distinguished philologists
i both hemispheres, independent oi
tch incontestible proofs of superior schol.
ship, the Classical Dictionary of Prossor
Anthon would of itself be a suffient
to establish his reputation as a schol*
of profounderudition, untiring industry,
id interminable research. A thorough
:quaintance with the Germafc language
is given the Professor free access to the
exhaustible mines of German literature,
hich he ha? spread with an unsparing
ind throughout the pages of the diction*
v; the works of modern tourists and
geographers have been consulted, and selections
have been made and inserted in
the respective articles, which not only 4nterest
the reader, but#in many instances
elucidate what was hitherto considered
doubtful or obscure. The author has
throughout his work been ever mindful of
.he maxim of the Roman satirist.
Nil.dicta fcedum, visque hsec liininia
tnngat,
Intra qute puerest.
The narratives of gross impurity, which
defiled th* pagesof Lempricre, are utterly
excluded by Professor Anthon, and we
can say with confidence, that Anthoi;s
Classical Dictionarv cannot fail to prove
acceptable to the ecclesiastic, the gentleman,
the scholar, the professional man,
or the reader of whatever description, j
who seeks for information upon subjects of |
antiquity.
Some twenty-five years since, any
person who'advanced the idea of editing a
Greek or Roman classical author, upo.i
ihe reputation of American scholarship,
would bo considered insane. Is it not
gratifying to our national pride, to reflect
that Professor Anthon has elevated the
character of our classical literature, even
in the country which produced a Bentlcy
and a Porson ?
Mr. Rnbrock, in Rine-street, has a few
copies of this work, and we presume that |
in a few days it can be obtained at a!l
the bookstores in our citv.

The Van Rensselaer tenants have had
a "general meeting" and passed of notable
resolutions; one of which informs that as
the Declarationof American independence
affirms that all mankind are created equal
1 and the Constitution of the Uuited States
guarantees a republican government to
the several States they are of opinion, se.
cundus, that the holding of so much land
as is held by the patroon of Rensselaerwick
I is in direct, violation of the said declaration
and repugnant to the constitution nfforesaid,
it was theretore solemnly re.
solved that the tendants would petition
Congress for a "redress of our grievances.'
Nay1 they further resolved that they would
go into a ten years contest with the patroon
unless they obtained before the end
of that time, a redress of their before
mentoned "grievances."'
It is a little mortifying to find that the
enlightened state of New.York?the c*ropire
member of the Union, as she is or
certainly ought to be in population, enterprise,
commerce, manufactures and intelgence,
can musferwithin her bordere an}r
number of citizens dark enough in intellect
and debased pnough in the knowledge
necessary to keep people out of the tire,
to entertain such notions as these. It is
worse than the doctrines of Brownson, and
almost low enough forSkidmoreism.
Mr. John Jacob Astor, Mr. Girnrd, of '
Philadelphia, and (he late Mr. Gray to
say n'othing of some ten or a dozen other
miilionarics in the United States arc, and
were worth twice as much as Mr. Van
Runcssnlser, and Mr. Astor, we venture
to say, has as many tenants. Why dont
they refuse to pay the rent which thay
were glad to agree upon in obtaining the
priviledgeof living upon the premescs??
They have the same right, and what is
more, the industrious mechanic of th is
city, who by his own hard work and prudent
management has become the owner
of more houses than one may just as reasonably
be resisted in the payment of rent
by the tenant who has no house but the
one he is glad to hire of his neighbor, as
the Alb. ny landlord who happens to be
richer than these sturdy republicans of
Rensselaer wick.
We had heretofore thought that it was
one of the blessings of our system that it
protected every man in the enjoyment of
his own, at the same time that every man
is left at libertv to make his own as large
as he could. We wonder whether wcare
mistaken in these views of the nature of
our Government!?iV. V. Cow. Jf Enquirer.

CONGRESS.
The twenty seventh Congress met in
Extra Session on Monday last the 31st
ult. From the arrival of members announced
in the Washington papers for some
days past, a full attendcnce may be pr?isuined.
This session will be the most
important that has taken place for many
yea-s, and gr^nt results for good or for
evil will certainly follow it. The Whig
party have a decided majority in each
branch, and, therefore have it in their
power to mould the legislation according
to their own views. In the present disor- j
dercd condition of the country, and in the
excited state of public expectation, the
responsibility is a most heavy one. We
shall see whether the recent contest, was
for principles or for men.
The subjects on which the people seem
to expert the immediate action ot Congress
are, 1. Thj disposition of the Proceeds J
of the public lands?2. The revision of ^
the Tariff with a view to an increase of
Revenue?and 3d a National Bank?We
earnestly hope that patriotism, wisdom
and moderation may control their deliberations
and conduct them to right issues

ministration was held in Charleston on
Saturday the 22nd ult. The Hon. Thos- i
Lowndes presided, assisted by four Vice
Presidents, and, on taking the Chair, ad.
dressed the meeting in a few beautiful
and impressive remarks. James L Petigru
Es<a. as Chairman of a Committee
of thirty-two, introduced a Preamble and
Resolutions expressive of the opinions of
the meeting on the subjects likely to form
the leading measures of the apprc aching j
Session of Congress. These resolutions,
affirm the constitutionality and necessity
of a National Bank; the propriety of pro.
viding for the deficiency of the Revenue
by a revision of the Tariff, consistently
with the Compromise Act of 1833; and
the justice and expediency of distributing
the proceeds of the Sales of the public
lands among the States: They also sus.
tain and c ommend the political course of
Senator Preston.
Ma. Preston, Mr. Legare and Mr.
Wilde, being present and called for, sevcrallv
addressed the meeting with great
eloquence and effect.
Judge Eakle, has declined hearing the
argument in the Scire facias case against
the Banks, on the ground that, as a hold,

Judge Butle* in a special Court, and, if
so, that it would commence on Thursday
last. The Counsel for the State are H.

Court of N. York in the caseofMcLeod,
has been concluded, but it is not expected
that the Court will make their derision
until the July term. The question to be
decided is, whether he shall he discharged
without trial. If the Court decide in the
| affirmative, that ends the Dsatter judicially;
if negatively, he will appeal to the
Court of Errors, which is the State Sen-'
ate, and ultimately, if necessary, to the
Supreme Court of the U. States. In the
meantime, he will be confined in the
House of Detention in Centre Street,
though doubtless he will bo permitted
to enjoy all reasonable indigencies.

The Democratic Party in the city' of
Charleston held a meeting on Thursday

distinguished members of the p?rty were*
present. A further notice of thier proceedings
will be given in our neat*
FOKErGN.
The Caledonia, of Cunard's line of
| Steamers, arrived at Boston on the 19th
nit., having left Cfcyerpool on the 4th and
bringing papers of mat city up to the day
of sailing, and of London to the 3rd.
No intelligence whatever of the Steamship
President, had reached England, although
about two months, from the dato
0' *
of her departure from New York, had
elapsed. No plausible conjecture can account
for such a state of circumstances*,
except the most appalling <tie, that, with
her priceless freight of human souls, she
has been the victim of the elements.
The news of President Harrison's det>b?
had reached England, and public meet
ingsof American citizens had been held
in Liverpool and London to express their

at the meeting.

I The most interesting ivtHttgeitceI
brought by the Caledonia, w of a demon
1 st ration marie by the Ministiv of m dmposition
to modify the revenue law* of that
1 country. Notice had l>een given to the
House of Commons of an intended proposal
to reduce the dutiei on foreign
Sugars and Timber, and, vhat ia more
important still to the grain growing sections
of our country, and gratifying t?
humanity, movements of the Ministry
seem to contemplate a revision of the
Corn Laws, atui a substitution of a moderate
duty on foreign grain fir the present
prohibitory impost. This tax upon
l>u\id, for the benefit of thelao<i owners
and farmers, has long been a subject of
| complaint with the ware of the people,
! and the present unexpected movement of
the Government seems to be txciting ini
tease feeling.
"The commercial intelligence by this
arrival is not favorable. Coton hadde.

fallen to a lower point than efer abroad,

It is said that there is & Mnt for the

should be made.?Fayet. Obs.
The Crops.?From a convention with
the Superintendent of Publu Worsts,
