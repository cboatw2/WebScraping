By (he President of the P Eli ted
States of America.
a proclamation.
Wheras a convention for the adjustment
of claims of citizens of the United
Sfntps nf America, unon the Government!
of thcMexican Republic was concluded
and signed at Washington, on the eleventh
day of April, in the year of our Lord,
one thousand eight hundred and thirtynine,
which convention, being in the English
and Spanish languages, is word for
word as follows:
Convention for the adjustment of claims
of citizens of the United States of America,
upon the Government of the Mexican
Republic.
Whereas a convention for the adjustment
of claims of citizens of the United
States, upon the Government of the Mexican
Republic, was concluded and signed
at Washington, on the 10th day ol September,
1838, which convention was not
ratified on the part of the Mexican Government,
on the alleged ground, that the
consent of his Majesty the King of Prussia,
to provide an arbitrator to act in the
case provided by said convention could
not be obtained:
And whereas, the parlies to said conTpntinn
nrp. still, and eouallv. desirous of :
teiruinating the discussions which have
taken place between them, in respect to
said claims, arising from injuries to the
persons and property of citizens of the
United States, by Mexican authorities, in
a manner equally advantageous to the citizens
of the United States, by whom said
injuries have been sustained, and more
convenient to Mexico, than that provided
by said convention : the President of the
United States has named for this purpose,
and furnished with full powers, John Forsyth,
Secretary of Slate of the said United
States; and the President of the Mexican
Republic, has named his excellency
Senor Don Francisco Pizarro Martinez,
accredited as Envoy Extraordinary and
Minister Plenipotentiary of the Mexican
Republic to the United States, and has
furnished him with full powers for the
same purpose: And the said plenipotentiaries
have agreed- upon, and concluded
the following articles:
Article 1. It is agreed that all claims
??f citizens of the United States upon the
Mexican Government, statements of which,
soliciting the interposition of the Government
of the United Slates, have been presented
to the Department of Slate, or to
the diplomatic agent of the United Stales
at Mexico, until the signature of this convention.
shall be referred to four commissioners,
who shall form a board, and be
appointed in the following manner, namely:
two commissioners shall be appointed
by the President of the United Slates, by
and with the advice and consent < f the
Senate thereof, and t\i o commissioner- b\ !
the President of the Mexican Republic, j
The said commissioners so appointed,
shall be sworn impartially to examine and
decide upon the said claims according to
such evidence as shall be laid before them j
on tho nnrt of tho TTnifnd States and the I
Mexican Republic respectively. *
Art. 2. The said board shall have two
secretaries, versed in the English and
Spanish languages; one to be appointed
by the President of the United Slates, by
and with the advice and consent of the
Senate thereof, and ttie other by the President
of the Mexican Republic. And the"
said secretaries shall be sworn faithfully
to discharge their duty in that, capacity.Art.
3. The said board shall meet in
tho city of Washington, within three
months after the exchange of the ratification*
of this convention, and withiu eighteen
months from the lime of its meeting,
shall terminate its duties. The Secretary
of State of the United States shall, immediately
after the exchange of the ratifications
of this convention, give notice
of the time of the meeting of the said
board, to be published in two newspapers
in Washington, and in such oilier papers
V .L? I. _ 1
as ne may mink proper.
Art. 4. All documents which now arc
i t, or hereafter, during the continuance
of the commission constituted hv this convention,
may come into the possession of
the Department of State of the United
States, in relation to the aforesaid claims,
shall be delivered to the board. The
Mexican Government shall furnish all such
documents and explanations as may be in
their possession, for the adjustment of
.said claims, according to the principles of
justice, the law of Rations, and the stipu
lations of the treaty of amity and commerce
between the United States and Mexico
of the 5th of April, 1831; the said
documents to be specified when demanded
al the instance of the said commissioners.
Art. 5. The said commissioners shall,
-- - > I J_ ooalc
i>y a rcpon unoer uieir nanus uuu ovui?,
decide upon the justice of said claims, and
the amount of compensation, if any, due
from the Mexican government in each
case.
Art. 6 It is agreed that if it should
not be convenient for the Mexican Government
to pay at once the amount so found
due, it shall be at liberty, immediately
after the decision in the several cases shall
have taken place, to issue Treasury notes
receivable at the maratime custom houses
of the republic, in payment of uny duties
which may be due, or imposed at said
custom houses, upon goods entered for
importation or exportation; said Treasury
notes to bear interest at the rate of
eight per centum per annum, from the
date of the award on the claim, in payment
of which said Treasury notes shall
have been issued, until that of their receipt
at the Mexican custom houses. But
as the orosecution and teceipt of said
'v .
Treasury notes at said custom houses, in
large amounts, might be inconvenient to
the Mexican government; it is further
agreed that, in such case, the obligation
of said government to receive them in
payment of duties, as above stated, may
be limited to one half the amount of said
duties.
Art. 7. It is further agreed that in the
event of the commissioners differing in
relation to the aforesaid claims, they shall,
jointly or sevarally, draw up a report
stating, in detail, the points on which
they differ, and the grounds upon which
their respective opinions have been formed.
And it is agreed that the said report
or reports, with authenticated copies of
all documents upon which they may be
founded, shall be referred to the decision
of His Majesty the King of Prussia. But
as the documents relating to the aforesaid
claims, are so voluminous, that it cannot
be expected his Prussian Majesty would
be willing, or able personally to investigate
them, it is agreed that he shall appoint
a person to act as an arbiter in his
behalf; that the person so appointed, shall
proceed-to Washington; that his travelling
expenses to that city, and from thence on
his return to his place of residence in
Prussia, shall be defrayed, one half by
the -United States and one halt by the
Mexican Republic; and that he shall receive
as a compensation for his service, a
sum equal to one half of the compensation
that may be allowed by the United
States to one of the commissioners to be

compensation that may be allowed by the
Mexican Government, to one of the commissioners
to be appointed by it. And
the compensation of such arbiter shall be
paid; one half by the United States, and
one half by the Mexican Government.
Art. 8. Immediately after the signature
of this convention, the plenipotentiaries
of the contracting parties (botli being
thereunto competently authorized) shall,
by a joint note, addressed to the Minister
I'pr Foreign Affairs of Ilis Majesty the
King-of Prussia, to be delivered by the
minister of the United States at Berlin,
invite the said monarch to appoint an umpire
to act in his behalf in the manner
above mentioned, in case this convention

of the United States and Mexico.

the Globe the Richmond Compiler and the
Petersburg Statesman, by yesterday's
mail, it appears that there have been elected
to the House of Delegates 71 whigs,
49 Democrats and I independent?Mr.
BAYLEYof Accomack. There is also one
tie in Frederick according to the whig papers,
though the Richmond Enquirer publishes
a return, giving a majority of two
votes to the Democrat, l'hc Whigs have
so far gained 3 members of the House, and
probably 2 of the Senate, thus securing a
majority on joint ballot. The only difference
however between the Legislature
elect and the late Legislature, will be that
the whig party will be consolidated, whereas
in the former body there were a number
of men who would vote for nobody
but Rives, and a number of others who
could not be persuaded to vote for the "lit

siderable majority in the late Legislature,
and the Democrats had a considerable majority
of the popular vote. It is far from
decided that the same is not true this year.
The majorities may be larger with one party
than the other.
There is auothcr consideration. In the
elections for the Legislature, the possession
of a freehold in any district gires the
right to a vote. A single voter therefore,
by owning the requisite freehold in twenty
different districts, may vote twenty times
if he can ride to so many different polls,
fn the presidential election it is not so.
There are also local questions that in many
cases absorb general politics, and contribute
still further to weaken any general
inference from the result. How true this
is, and how important to take it into consideration,
may be judged from the following
facts. In April 1832, the Whigs
elected a majority of 2-1 in the House of
Delegates, and confidently counted upon
the vote-of Virginia for Clay. Ill the
Presidential election six months after
Jackson hud a majority ol two thousand
voles. So little does tlic general result of
the popular voice depend on the complexion
cf the Legislature.
Something, also?nay, much, is to be
attributed to the parties, in reference to
federal measures. To no one public measure
are the Whigs of Virginia committed,
except perhaps, the distribution of the
public lunds among the States, and the
recent defalcation in the Bank ol Virginia,
may have strengthened the general desire
to mend their finances by other means than
taxation. They feel somewhat poorer than
before. But in other respects the Whigs,
by steadfastly adhering to the mum policy
:if Gen. Harrison's "Committee of three,"
have escaped the odium which in the "Old
Dominion" will ever attach to the general
principles and undoubted designs of the
... TL ? TJ : - i:L.?
*? nig puny* ? uc uaiiisun men, ni\e
their candidate, answer no questions, commit
themselves to no measures, except
measuresof hard cider, and profess nothing
but opposition. Where is the question o(
a National Bank, which even Gen. Thompson,
in giving in his adhesion to Harrison,
deems it necessary to advocate, and
which is urged on subtly hut steadily in
most of the lending Whig papers of the
Union? Where is the question of the Tariff,
which the Whig papers of New England
assure us, will be restored by the election
of Harrison? The Whigs of Virginia
have not heard of these questions.
Tliey are according to their own account
of themselves, a party who are opposed
to the "present distress," and in favor of
making the people of the United States
all rich and happy. They confess to no
party design, but a general and anxious
disposition to set all thing right, and accordingly
"every man who is in trouble,
and every man who is in debt" looks to
them.

the Republicans of Virginia have been
j divided in regard to the most important
measure of the Administration?the Independent
Treasury. The opposition of
Mr. Rives to that measure, while he was
still supposed to be a friend of the Administration,
and the half measure advocated by
the Richmond Enquirer, spread not a lit]
tic confusion and distrust through the Republican
ranks. They felt less motive to
push forward the cause?the Administration
could be reviled for its hard money
doctrines by its enemies, and the reply
from its friends was not a bold and sturdy
vindication, but a confession that in this
matter they were wrong, or perhaps a palliation
or evasion. The victory went bv
default to the Whigs, on the very question
whiftfi- nf nil nitnipi. line moat divi.
ded and agitated ilic country. Giving up
this, was in fact giving up every thing,
and the Republican party in Virginia was
for a time left without a common object.
The question of the Independent Treasury
was not fairly examined before the
people, as it was in other States. But we are
not now about to discuss Virginia politics.
The above observations arc sufficient to
show that the materials for calculating!
ihe position ol V irginia, on the rrcsMieii-j
tial question are very confused, and the
result of the election decides nothing beyond
itself. The Whigs have yet a battle
to fight for the vole of Virginia.
VIRGINIA.
We arc able to confirm to day to a certain
extent, what was favorable in our yesterday's
view of the state of things in Virginia.
The only remaining Senatorial district
is settled according to the Richmond
Compiler in favor of the Whigs which
makes the Senate 16 to 16?a tie. Jn the
House, comparing the latest returns, the
Whigs have secured 68 delegates?being
a majority of 4 in that body We except
Mr Bayley who is pledged both against
Rives and Harrison. We also except
Mr. Fulton who is pledged to vole for
Democratic Senators, if his district gives a
majority as it has always done, for that
party at the fall election. Without counting
these two on the other side, the
the Democratic party lmve elected 56
delegates, and there remain 6 districts to
hear from which sent to the last Legislature
1 Whig and 5 Democrats. Jf there is
no change, the Democrats will have one

THE CRISIS.
Messrs. Editors:?The time has arrived
when something should be done by the
Banks, for the relief of the people of our
Stale. The low price of our great staple
the number of suits pending throughout the
State, the depreciation in value of every
species of property, together with the ini]phti>diipc<:
nf merchants fn tho Thinks. irn
lo prove conclusively, that the pressure is
without a parallel. When I say that something
should be done for the relief of the
people, t mean the planting interest? for
if accommodation is extended to the planter,
it is indirectly given lo every class of
our citizens; and 1 think I can clearly show
that the interest of all parlies concerned
will be thus promoted. Let the banks loan
to planters 25 per cent of their capital, i
(bused upon such security as well place
their safety beyond all question,) for one
and two years. This would enable them
to prevent their property from being sacrificed
for one third of its value, and place
it in the power of the merchants lo pay the
banks. Whereas, if contraction continues
to be the order of the day, the banks will
finally have to shoulder the loss, besides
incurring the just censure for having failed
to fulfil the intention ol their establishment.,
Why is it the case that the planters generally,
throughout the State, arc so much
incensed against them? It is because
their produce is depressed to a point, at
which they are not remunerated for their
labor; and in the face of this, have been cut
off from all accommodation, by the banks,
further than the facilities given to merchants
for the purchase of their cotton and
rice. Give them to feel and sec that the
banks are identified with thetn, and they
will leave it with the banks to say, when
our indebtedness to Europe, and the North,
will authorise them to resume payments in
specie. Let the banks hold a convention
at Columbia, on the 15ih of May next,
and be united as one man, for the relief ol
the People* 11 is to be regretted that some
banks in onr State, have larger capitals
than others, as it iiives them u conlrolinir
influence; but under existing circumstances,
should not excite uneasiness, ns their action
would be for their own welfare, and
the good of the people of South Carolina.

COCHRAN'S EOA1B CANNON.
Washington, Monday, April 13.
The rumors of war have set some of
our people about considering whether we
are at all prepared for such an explosion.
What is the result? All our forts prove to
be almost entirely unsupplied with ordnance.
We have plenty of forts, but precious
little in them. Hence, some of the
various improvers of fire arms, who have
been dancing attendance upon the Government
for a long time to no purpose.
have been brought out by the toscin, and
arc offering their plans. It is passing
strange, but very true, that even the best
of these meets with opposition among the
official personages who ought to be foremost
in giving encouragement to every
I improvement bearing marks of any thing
like promise. I allude to Cochran's Patent
Bomb Cannon. If a number of members
of Congress bad not seen its merits
and taken it tip vigorously and fearless!},
this great invention might never -been
heara of.?There is every likelihood, now,
of its gelling into genera! use and superseding
all oilier ordnance. It has been
tried twice here, in the presence of large
assemblies. The last trial was on Saturday,
April 11, at the Arsenal. But before
I (iesrribc tlie triumphs of this lastexpe
rimeni, or. wmcn i mysctl was present, 1
will say a word about the pnweis to which
the new invention makes claim.
First, then, it can fire sixteen shot in
the time required for two of an ordinary
cannon; some say more. It can be managed
by six men ; for the management of
an ordinary cannon, eleven are required,
jso that each one saves the rations of five
men. It has no recoil, hence docs not require
to be kept in its place by breeching.
It is charged without cither swab or ramroc'.?The
rapid firing docs not heal it.
Ordinary cannon must be cooled with vinegar
and water after thirty discharges; but
Cochran's has been found perfectly cool
after one hundred shots in rapid succession.
| It has thrice the durability of ordinary can1
All /r. . r ?'l - -? I i
'mm. rtii guns iirsi mil ai me oreecn,
iwliere tlie charge first ignites and the ball
'starts but as Cochran's is constructed with
a three chambered revolving breech, of
j course it must be of thrice the durability
of those now in use*
It has been observed by some of the
members of Congress who have witnessed
experiments, that a single steamer with
two sixty-four pounders constructed on
'Cochran's plan, might destroy any line of
j battle ship. None ol the latter carry
hcavier metal than the forty-two pounder,
and while these were under the act of being
loaded, an unbroken stream of fire
would be pouring in upon the line of battle
ship like re-iterated thunder bolts so that
nothing could save her from sinking. The
steamer, too, being smaller in size, woulJ
be less exposed, although so much larger
in power. The advantages from increased
celerity would cnuallv attend the use of
Cochran's gun in fortresses. ' For a garrison
gun," says a letter of General Wad*
dy Thompson, Chairman of the Military
Committee,?44 tbcre cannot be a doubt
about it.''44 f regard it as beyond measure,"
observes he in another place,'4 the greatest
improvement in the way ol'fire arms
that I have seen.
On Saturday last, the attendance at the
Arsenal was very numerous. A great number
of Senators and Representatives appeared.
The experiments were thoroughly
successful. The first thirty two discharges
were made within four minutes.
In the next experiment, seventeen discharges
were made in two 'jiinulcs and twenty
seconds. In the third, there were eight
within the minute. In the fourth, [there
were three in a thirJ of a minute.
