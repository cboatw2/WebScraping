though that hill had been reported, and <
was different from this, he would vote for <
?hebill now under consideration* His I
reasons for doing so, he would condense J
us briefly as possible. . j
He believed that Congress had power j
to establish a National Bank, or a Fiscal 1
Agent, as you may please to call It. He j
considered the power, on the part of Con* I
gress, to be a closed question. When he <
could believe that the Congress which j
first passed a bill?that Washington, who J
first signed a bill?that Jefferson, who I
signed a bill to establish a branch of the i
first bank?that the Congress that passed I
the second bank charter*?that Madison, i
who signed thecharter?that the Supreme
Court, that has decided upon the question, f
end the concurrent acquiescence of the <
People of the United States for forty
vrairfl. were all ignorant of the Constitu*
J , ... c
tion, and had been willing to violate it? f
when he could believe this, he would doubt, (
the power of Congress to establish a Bank,
but not till then. t
The question of power being settled in j
this rapid and summary manner, he had t
but a word to say, and time would allow
him to say but a word, as to the expedien- t
cy of the measure. He thought the measure
of establishing a bank necessary. A
bank could not make business, currency, b
exchanges, and the custody of the public tj
money worse than they are now. A i,
change will be an improvement, and the J
experience of the past and the wisdom of
the present point to an institution of this e
kind as equally important to the opera- ^
lions of the Government and the business p
transactions of the People. Public ne.
cessity and public interest all require the
passage of some measure of this kind.
Had he the power to frame a bill, he *
would make it different in many p&rticul- '
ars from the present. He would prefer a
Jfe bank with branches of circulation, with s
power to deal in exchanges, and believed
that such an institution would answer the
purposes of the Government, and would 5
give a good circulating medium and equalize
exchang s. He had no time to
discuss the subject, and could but now say
that he would vote for the present bill
because it seemed to be one most agreea- tl
l?l? tn n mainritv. nnd he Could not llODe to 3
? *?J J ' f> '
effect his wishes in the details of such a ti
measure.
Some measure was necessary. The
public interest united with the public voire c
in loud demind for its passage. He t|
would cheerfully ) ield to the requirements
of both, and sustain the measure. Having v
said this much, he could bur express the n
hope that the measure would pass this c
House, and finally become the law. He v
had now two minutes left of the five, by ^
the Shrewsbury clock, and he would let
some one else appropriate them. a
The hour of 1*2, having arrived, the h
Committee; in pursuance of the order of w
the House of Wednesday, last, proceeded,
without.further debate, to vote on all amendments
" pending or that might be
offered." W
The -first question was on the motion of 0
Mr. Dean to strike out the enacting clause v
of the bill.

Sergeant, rose and reported the bill to the tl
House precisely in the form in which it y
came from the Senate. 0

^ bill to a third reading?
Mr. Arnold (doing, he said, what he

Upwards of 100 Indians, men, women

Tun Temperance Cause.
. Saratoga Springs July, 31.
There has been much animation and excitement
this week at the Springs. The
third American Temperance Convention
I commenced its session, in this town, on
Thursday, the 27th instant, and closed its
proceedings, on the 30th inst. at six
o'clock P. M. This body was composed
of 550 delegates from the several States
?Georgia and Alabama were represented
among the Southern States, and Louisiana
and Tennessee among the Southwestern.
All of the Eastern, Nothern
and [Middle States sent their representa.
tives, with Michigan Iowa, from the Far.
west. There was much zeal and ability
displayed in the discussion of the questions
brought before the Convention. The
principle measures adopted, were the for.
mation of a General American Tempei
ranee Union. The offer of a reward or
premium, for the best Essay, to be composed
of 200 pages in duodecimo, on the
disgraceful practice adopted by dealers in
spirituous liquors, of the adultereation oi
wines, brandy, gin, beer and other intoxicating
drinks.
In the consideration of this question many
anecdotes were related of the facility witli
which wines, of all descriptions were imi.
tated,and of the mischevious consequence;
r
which resulted from the use of the siraulated
articles. It was stated, that it had
been ascertained,, that in order to render
the inferior qualities of whiskey more pungent,
oil of vitriol had been introduced as
an ingredient; a sure precursor of a short
life to the drinkers. It was also related
that an extensive vender of wines had acknowledged,
that he had purchased a barrel
ofwhiskey froma merchant in one of the
large cities, at 31 cents, and, in 24 hours
afterwards, converted the same whisky into
manufactured wine, and sold the new
article for pure foreign wine, at $2 per
gallon, to the identical merchant from
whom, when whisky, it had been purchased.
It was truly appalling to hear of the
detections which had been made of the
mixture of the most deletarious drugs in
wines and liquors, considered peculiarly
choice. And to those who are accustomed
to think the moderate use of spirits esaontinl

Mr. An.her wa9 right in taking issue
with Mt. Calhoun as to the sentiment of
Virginia respecting the disorganizing doctrine
of repeal. The doctrine will be repudiated
by a very large, and the most
respectable portion of the Van Buren party.
The people of Virginia, in the mass, are
a moral law-loving people. They con
sider the maintenance of the public and
the scantity of private property essential
to the preservation of the Republic.?
They believe, too, in the sovereignty ol
the people, and their capacity for selfgovernment?both
of which this new and.
monstrous doctrine substantially denies

i. 3ives us pleasure to state that all our
anticipations of the unpopularity of the
odious and agrarian doctrine of "Repeal,"
as proposed to be applied to a Bank Charter,
ifone should be granted by Congress
and become a law, are already more than
realized; and, what is more gratifying still
that so far from its being made a party
question, the leaders will have the greatest
difficulty in preventing an immediate
and indignant outbraek in the rank and
file, in opposition to their prepoeterious
idea, and their more wicked agitation.?
A specimen of this we have lately had in
a neighboring country, where the trammels
of party allegiance we are at once snapped
when such a doctrine was made the test
of orthodoxy. Mr. Archer said right, the
Other day, when he affirmed that tkis pecies
of nullification would be more repudiated
in Virginia, than any that had preceded its
promulgation. We made the same assertion
in the beginning when this cry of Repeal
was first raised by the underlings; and our
confidence in its rejection has not lessened
now that the potent voice of Mr. Calhoun
has been raised in favor?a voice,
we lament to say, heard so often on so
many sides of so many questions, that it
has ceased to carry any longer with it, its
wonton authority. Asa party weapon,
we would desire nothing better to wield
against the agitfttors, than this same Repeal.
It would be a mace in the hands
of the Republican champions with which
to beat down their adversaries past the
power of raising. The people of this
country area law loving, and law abiding
people. They can be excited to commit
wrong; but they cannot be deliberately
led into the adoption of measures designed
on their face, to violate contracts?
destroy vested rights?and upturn the
foundation of society.?[Alex. Gazetta.
Mississippi Bonds.?Governor McNutt,
of Mississippi, has given Afessrs. Hope Ac
Co., of Amsterdam, notice that "this state
never will pay the five millions of dollars,
issued in June, 1638, or any portion of
the interest due, or to become due thereon.
"The money" he says "paid for those
bonds did not come into the state Treasury.
The officers of the Government had
no control over its disbursement. The
bonds were disposed of in 1838, by collision
and fraud, in voilation of the Consti*
tution and laws of the State. The Jl/ississippi
Union Bank, and the Bank of the
United States, were parties to this uulawful
transaction. You have the endorsement
of both these institutions, and to
them you must look for payment."

LACING.
A NEW SOCIETY.?LOOK OUT GIHLS.
It is stated in the Boston Post that a
meeting of young men in that city, called
to take into consideration the reason why
so many of their fair young fellow citizens
are afflicted with such feeble health, are
unable to uso only moderate exercise,
i - n i _iP ! ^ xl ! i
ana are so onen cui on in me prime 01
life, and brought to a premature grave?
after much discussion, a thorough investigation,
and very minute observation of the
i subject, unanimously arrived at one conelusion,
and that is this, viz: feebleness
and inability to use violent exercise, and
palefacedness, arises from the deleterious
i use of stays, which they lace around their
i bodies enormously tight, almost to sufFo- 1
. cation. As far as we are able to ascer.
. tain (they say in their report) it is done
to improve Ibeir forms, hut in our opinion
it very mufch deforms them ; and while
i they try to make their waists as small as
i possible, they are using the best possible
method to waste their comfort, happiness, !
and even life itself. After a serious consideration
of these astounding facts, the
> meeting unanimously adopted the followi
iDg resolutions, viz;
Resolved* That we will not have anyi
thing to (fa with any young ladv whom
_ ? _ -
A
I
ire know to be in the habit of wearing
stays.
Resolved, That upon becoming no
quainted with a lady it shall be our first
duty to inform ourselves if sbd is in the
babit of wearing those " woman killers."
Resolved, That if we should be so unfortunate
