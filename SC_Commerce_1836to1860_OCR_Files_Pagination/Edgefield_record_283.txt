FROM FLORIDA.
We insert the following letter from a
Ylorida correspondent,. premising that
while he has stated affairs pretty much as,
we fear, they exist it that territory, lie ap
pears to have'indulged a disposition t
draw on his imagination for the proclamna
tion inclosed, which, though never before
gazetted, is, we apprehend, a Mdir exposi
tion of the spirit of the Tallahassees.
" Dear Sir,-This is the 27th of July.
On the 16th, according to proclamation.
all tne Indians were to have been -intra
limites" south of Pease Creek, but, nlas, no
such good news can he told. The Indianas
have not gone south, nor do I believe they
intend to do so. The Tallahassees say,
that they were no parties to the so'called
* treaty,' that they are very well supplied
with every thing needful-arms, ammuni
tion, provisions, &c.; that the country
now in their possession suits thema won
derfully well, and if the white folks want
it, they must come and take it."

LATh Faom FLoaInA.-Mre Indian
Murders.-By the politeness of a friend,
we havd been favored with the perusal of
a letter received from a, gentleman resi
ding in Tallahassee. dated Sunday morn
ing, 14th inst. which states that great ex
citement prevailed at that place im conse
quence of the Indians having attacked
and murdered several families in that
vicinity the night previous, and fired their
dwellings. The writer states that the
conflagration was seen from Tal!ahassee.
and that the city, although Sunday. was
in arms. A draft, it was contidently
expected, would take place in a few days
-a large number of the troops having
been removed frot the territoryi conse
quence of the treaty recentl) entered into
by Gen. Macomb. This is ceasing bos
tilities with a vengeance. Indeed there
have been quite as many bloody atroci
ties committed by the Indians since the
"talk" held with Gen. M. as was ever
known to have taken place during the
samelength oftime previously.
From the Tallahassce Floridian, of July 20.
A letter froni East Florida we learn
states, that San Jones had come in at lhri
Lauderdale with 30) warriors. and cone
into the district of country assigned them
in General Macomb's treaty. It is stated,
however. that lie considers he has a lee.
simple title to the conutry. and will not re
move west. The express who broughi
the letter, stated that Sam Jones says hi.
is the onl tribe that will make peace
and that there are yet many hostile war
riors in the country.. If so, there is little
prospect of the war being closed.
In confiriation of the above, a gentle
man who resides on the Ocilla frontier,
and who is well acq.-ainted with the coun
try, having acted for a long tine as guide
to ihQ.troops.says that there are moreIndian
signs west of the Ocilla, at present, than
be has seen at any time during the war.

lndihns at Drayton Island.-T his island
is situated in Lake George, and owied
by Z. Kingsley. Esq,, who had reoccupied
it on the arnutstice ell'eeted by. Gei:erai
Macomb, in full confidence of the since
rity of the Indians, on the completion of
that treaty. Laist week, a rumor was
afloat that the enemy had visited it, and
told tile negroes thereon that they must
leave, as next moon," as soon as they
should have collected their corn, they in
tended to renew the war- We are not ini
cline-d to give credence to this statement.
not because the story was told by negroes,
for generally their relations respecting in
dians have turned 'tut true, but becaiuste
the island was sit uted in that part of the
territory north of the " neutral ground ;"
and we did not thitnk that they would
coinmnenee their predatory excursions be
fore -he fall. The negro~es, howeve-r, on
Wednesday last, passed down the river
and stated to Lieutenant Poole, the comt
mianding officer at Picolata, that a large
number of Indians had appeared on the is
land,. and they had left in consequence of
their visit. The circumstances, we con
ceive, w arrant our drawiung t he attention
of Gen, Taylor to the exposed situation of!
the eastern bank of the St. John's river.
From Picolata to the mouth of the S:.
Jothu's, there are living at this titme up)
wvards of one hundred families. wvhose resi
detntes are detached from each othter, and
not sutficiently contiguotus to allow concert
amiona them, in the' event -of the invabion
of the enemy. They have in the grotund,
sugar-ca e, cotton, and ptrovibions, inesides
upwards of a thousand slaves, horses, and
stocks of cattle. This, to these residents,
is a matter of somni tmment, involving all
of their wealth, atnd thte prospects of a
maintenance of their families. Many per
suns had determined Ott making an eflhrt
to reoccttpy their abatndon--d farms, and
seek relief from the blighting sting~s of po
verty,. which thtey have bteen subjected to.
The rations, too, accorded under a resotln
tion of Congress, to the wants and sutfer
ings of the inhabitants of~ Florida, have
been discontinued to a nuznmtr who have
heretofore drawn ; and the necessity ofap
plying to the earth for a relief of their
wants, is still more urgent. Yet. there
isatnd mttst be distrust, as long as Indlians
are seen and knaown to be prowling about
the country; no mtan can cultivate, no man
can hope for the reward of bis labor,. Un
der the ptresent arratuemuent, with its ii
position of troops, bumt a smiall amount of

wisdom to provide against the worst; and
of all errors, that of trusting too much to
the integrity of the Indian is ite most fa tal.
Fort liatnson, on Moccasin Brancht, con
tains by far too small a force to meet exi

commercial condition of England as exhib

worthy (if gerious study- nay, involvinig
as it does our own interest to so fearful an
exteut, it d'emands the closest scrutiny. A
London paperreviewing the commercial
relation, of England and the last quarter

the following observation:
&-From this return,therefore,it would still
apj)ear that the Bank.of England has not
been able to control the foreign exchanges.
which is a very important feature in the
return, but in other reqpects there is but
little to notice beyond the circumstance
hat th-ir great burden, "the deposits,"
have again decreased."
Withiti the year preceding the 25th June,
the-bullion in the Bank had been diminish
ed the enormous slim of X.5,378,000, and
ihe process wits still going onl. Ai the date
uf the sailing of the Great Western, the
specie in the Bank was saict to be lesstbanl
ftur millions sterling, (sote accounts say
less than three) and.the exchanget on the
Ith of July actually becoming more unfa
vorable to Etigl-and. Has commerce lost
her balance? Has the autocrat of the
moiley market dropt the sceptre? Has
the Bank slumbered while all Europe was
[ingering her exchequer?
The system by which the Bank of Eng
land pretends to govern the exchanges is
very simple and known to most persons
who pay attention to such subjects, it is,
la case of exchange auainst London, to
uriail her circulation; if need be, to raise
the rate of interest, and thus produce a
pressure and panic among English buyers,

them." Well. '11 advance the tioney,"
' Where will you get it." "Borow il

old woman money now, and I always

she'll get her nuts from other dealers."
"No she shall not; for I'll advance to them
and get them to hold back, until she comes
dlown in the end with an almighty price
for all."- "I dout see how the old woman
can live if you borrow all her money. and
hold back that and groundnuts and ever

and refuses to buy the groundnuts. Sup

Those that we have seen, have a patent

the driver can, by placit one foot upon a

NAVAL HISTORY OF TFIE U. STATEs.
The British Naval and Militarv Gazette
has given the following opinion of the Na
val l-story of the United States, by Mr.
Cooper:
"We have pernsed this history with no
little curiosity and with great interest.
Considering the brief exislence or the A
merican marine, its annals are more event
ful, more romantic, and iore varions
than any in existence. Nothing can sur
pass the energy which enabled the United
States to fori an effective navy, at a time
when thev could hardly he said to have
had a political existence, and when they
were beset by greaterdiflculties tian any
which an infant nation had ever yet to en
counter. This consideration ha's aninia
ted the present historian, whose enthusi
asin seems to be kindled by his ofice of
chronicler, even more than when he for
merly songbt inspiration from the same
source in constructing his famous stories
of the sea. His national pride has, how.
ever, not tempted him to be, afterthe man
nter of his countrymen, vain-glorious as te
gards his own nation, and abusive towards
others. His work, accordingly, is more
fair and candid than could have been ex
pected on sueh a theme from an Ameri
can pen. Altogether this history is a val
nable one, and rannot fail to pass into uni
versal circulation. The incidents which
took place in the naval war with Tripoli
are grander and more heroic than any
thing in the circle of romance, and are
detailed with all the vigor and animation
of Mr. Cooper's ceniuis."
