Communication.
"And from afar he heard
The voice of fame, and vowed to he rentowned,
And deeper still ne vowed to keel his vow."
PolLock's Course of Time.
In a former number of your paper, I
oberved a commnication frmn somite
chainpion of -*'Jeromne," (recently kn..wn
as -No Candidate.") which from the fre
quent repetition of the . ord -Practice,"in
duces ue to suppose it intended as a re
ply to an article, some itime appearing
under that signature.
I confess myself in no degree, surprised
at this etlort to retort; and infinitely less
at his manner of attack. For he who is
silly in tre choice of a "hobhy," becomes
invariably more so in his labors for itssup
port. But for one of "No Candidate's"
calibre to assume to himself, the double
character of Reformer anl Critic, excites
amazeTieut,irresistibly ludicrous. Though
entertaininig the kindest personal regard
for the supposed author, anti highest re
spect for his principles; yet in pronouncing
his communication a rare di-play of inor
dinate vanity and arrogance, is but doing
courtesy to justice andl truth In his ex
ordium, he appears as a "-master spirit" be
stowing some mark of approhatiou on one,
and directing the nod ofcensure to another
Then with the authority of an "Ilpse Dix
it" acquaints Saluda. with his charitable
design of permitting his opponents to flour
ish two years tiore. Oh wouderous Mag
nauimnity ! Thou rarest of virtues now on
ly to be found amongst the REFORM
IERS, of EDGEFIELD. ' Why, why lhst
thou reinated so long in obscurity?
Why not have developed thyself and
ea*ned thy desert,the homage of the world!
Perhaps thou hast been retained as the
perfector of Reform. Possibly,as the ear
nest of immortality too hy noble possessor,
No C:mdidate- If so, success atten-i thee.
In reflecting upon the difereut motives
by which men are actuated, I am forced
to the conclusion, that ambition has been
at work with .Ins Gra<.e. No Candidate.
Methinkb Isee him with a pregnantiction
ary. searching fer reputation. Then ex
claiming, with elxjueice restless oa his
tongue, determninatwan aashing in his e)e,
and power dilating the man;
"To die and leave lehind
Nought ol' survivng t-ame,
Of the divine -reating "mind.
To tr..ce no sngle name.
To do ao deed, no word,
Our uemnorv to restore
But that weon gone. there shall be heard
Ot us no mention more.
Mock not that thou hear'st me sigh,
",Jerome," this is indeed to die."
Let's up and itiitaiie the paragons co
old. J ii becomes necessary we mtay re
cant, and stil be like Cranmier. Bu to
do No Candidate a kinidness, we will pre
sune his reformiu- air'ationis lanished
by .centridon, and .the Relruser extinet.
"Alas Poor Yorick" But here's hi- sXhost,

half agallon to the bushel, besides the usual
quantity of whiskey-which is three gallons
to the bushel. It has been used as a sub

prov..d in eyery respect equal, and not ae

cral barrels of this corn oil were bronahit
t Cincinnati twoor three years ago, mann -

There are. prohably three millions hunsk

of whiskey,and would produce. in addition

.Tie high and univers.l repmation of the
lianttrath Pills, r. nders it utniecesary tocoin
me t I rge.ly on their particular virtues. A4 an
aoti-bilimns and purgative medicine, they are
uneduled by any. Their purifyng effuet on
dhe blood is universally allowed-all that have
ever used have approved and recomnwided
.hem.
In many cases where the dreadful ravages of
ulceratin had laid bare ligamlent aud bone, itnd
where to all appearance, no huntn ineans
could save life, have patients by the use oltiese
Pills, been r..stored to good herilth; the devour.
iu diaease having beencompletely eradicated.
Il contseqtuenev of the pleasantness of their
operaliiin, they are universally used in every
section orthis widle extended country where
they are m:ede known, and are last suirperseding
every other Preparation of professed siniar
import. Upwards ol Fourteen flhousand cases
have been certilied as cured, solely frot their
inee since tie in-ro.luction of that into the U.
Staes, thus establishing the fact heyond all
doobt. that the Braudreth Pdas cure the (appa
rentily) most opposite diseases, by the one
silple act of continuanltV evacuatina the how

therefore, whatever imay be said of the TrnEOt.
the UTILTY 0 the PRACTICE is now BEYOND al
