t, Three it thfif ratJraeht connect
three different quarter*. pf the Globe,
i .which for ages%uuld hare known little of
rfech other withota them. ' China .U eonnccted
with England by scarcely pny
other link than her tea; for three hupared
years tobacco was the sole link between
England and the Western world, and Arrabia
is to this momen scarcely bound to
us, "but by her. coffee. Soch . are the
slender but powerful sources of National
connection'. The discerery of coifre was
not mado until the latter part of |he 13th
century, and, like any other great discovery,
it was the result of chance^ adopted
by necessity. An Arab, the ftcheykh
Omar, fell under prosecution in his own
country; he and his disciples fled to a
mountain in the province of Yemen,
whore in the desert, all usual food failed
him; a coffee berry grew there wild, and
the distressed refugee, as it was too hard
for him to piasticate, tried its effect by
boiling; he drank the liquor, found himself
revived, and made it immortal.
Yet rocemmcnded as it was, by - its
refreshing properties, its spontaneous
?rbwth, and still more, such is the absurity
of mankind, by the example of a
fool or knave, who called himself a saint,
coffee took upwards of two, centuries to
mckc its way into the world. Even in
its own country, it was dishonored as a
prophet among his kindred; and near as
p.,rwnt iitna i? ' '' " 1
?" ""'i ? was iiui mi iue intra ccniury
from its discovery, that it insinuated
itself into the sober potations of the
-Egyptians. It is seldom that a world is
indebted to superstition for any thing 'except
cardinals and carnivals; but the folies
of the Arab devotees, in . the lamj of the
l'haroahs, who win gqjden opinions of
men by extravagances that would even
degrade the mules ihe'y rifle,, were the
firs parentage of Egyptian Coffee drinking.
The wretched people, spending half i
their time in watching, and half their, existence
in mortifying tho withered flesh
on their tawny bodies, foUnd coffee essential
to keep their bodies and souls together.
The Turk then adopted it. It suited his
laziness and his stupidity. The showy
barborian wanted nothing but tobacco to
complete the curse which to the slave
and the sensualist, turns all the enjoyments
of the senses into evil. Tobacco
came to add perpetual intdxication to his
catalogue Of wilful calamities- ft is ? I
remarkable instance of the perversity of
the human, will, when left to itself; that
while coffee \Vith all its singular powers
of cheering the miml, and refreshing the
nerves, took nearly fouc hundred years
to make itself known in Europe, and
while the Potato* is scarcely more than
coming into use in a large portion of the
Continent. Tobacco took little more than
half a dozen years to be known os far as
ships can carry it; that it is now the favorite
filth of every Savage lip within
the circumference of the Globe; that it
fills the atmosphere of the continent with
a perpetual stench, that the Spaniard
sucks it (as he says,) for the heat?the
Dutchman for*the cold?thO frenchman,
because he wtjl do nothing else?the
London and America!) apprentice and
loafer, because it makes him took like a.
gentleman?and all because it is in its
own nature the filthiest, most foolish,
dullest, and most disgusting practice on
the fece of the earth.?Blackwoods Magazine.
A Man of few Words.?A young
man some time since arrived at a certain
inn, and after alighting from his horsd
went into the. traveller's.room, where he
walked backwards and forwards for some
time, displaying the utmost self-importance.
At length he r&rig the bell, atid
upon the waiter's appearance gave him an
order nearly as follows:
' Waiter V9

disturbing the house, I'll thank you to

"Yes sir," replied the waiter.
"In the first place bring me a gldss df

and also a tea spoon; wipe down this

.A writer in the Courier eays:??
I find by the Meeaage of the Governor,
that the Trustee's of ihe College have
gam ueen aoviseu to the admisStdn of a
PrOfessdr of Civil and Military* Engincr ng*
.This js the .measure proposed by
Gov. M'Duffie, and objected to by the
Faculty* upon the stofc of time? -no possibility,
during the classic term, or admitting
recitations upon either ofthese.branhes.
11 is well known that Gov. M'Duffie,
apprisad of these facts, acceded to the
proposition contained in the notice of a
Dill for an additional scientific term of
six weeks or two months of the summer
vacation, as published in your paper of
the 25th pit. lie not only acceded, but
ncqtfiesced most heartily in it and believed
the only difficulty would arise oh the
part of parents fearing the exposure of the
camp. v. i- ' 1 - ;
From discussing on the publication
referred to, 1 am led to believe that a
greater doubt exists as to the proficiency
of boys, while engaged in camo service.
than in the more important intellectual
exercises. He is little vdrfeeil in the
study of of the sciences, who docs not
acknowledge that it is upon these studies
alone, that the human mind leans for its
morality, its energy and its taste,. In
the enumeration of the Classic courses,
it is observed that Chemistry, Mineralogy,
Mechanical Philosophy, and Astronomy
are recorded. The theory of the sciences,
are here alone contended for. But if
there be facilities offered, by which I ho
practice attaching to them could be made
available, can there be a doubt but that
the Professors of these branches woul l
sedulously improve them? The friends
of the encampment term, arc desirous
that the disciplin of the College, should
be Military?that the exercise of the Colilcgiates
should be adapted to the same
! uses-^-that their associations should be of
that chiva'Iric character, which would
place them above the low debaucheries
that too often spring from injudicious attempts
'to impose Ihsks which are altogether
offensive to the "tastes of the coerced.
I ne system or encampments, is a means
for the attainment of a desirable end?tl?e
formation of a great practical scientific
school. Once fenchain the attention, respect
and admiration of the youth of
Carolina to the study of the sciences, and
they will soon exhibit the interesting
spectacle observable in all College^, or
Student's of.Medicino. I-am not a Malinet,
or am I desirous of training the citizens
of America to arms?for the love of
arms. I am one of those who regard the
science of war as a solemn science, and
,one which waits upon the mandates of
Divinity alone. We are told that war,
pestilence and famine must prevail until
the regeneration of the world. It is to
abide such contingencies that I would train
.K_ :? '? * --
me Buiuu?n ib t?j uisr.uarge me services
required of a Society, existing under such
contingencies, that I would have the youth
of Cardlina prepare themselves for \yar,
and they can effectually do this only after
the plan suggested. Let us assume the
classes formed, and the Professors ready
for instruction?the senior class composed
of.twenty students, are ordered as a party
of Topographical Enginers, to reconnoitre,
survey and locate a line of Military
road across a given section of country, to
be used for the transportation of their
!!?. t ?
military stores; navtng accomplished this,
they apply to their notes and compute the
time, labor and expense of the construction,
so much for level districts, the cost
of causewaying, bridgeing, and the methods
beSt adapted to Ihcs'e purposes.
The second day would be devoted to the
Construction with axes, shovels, and picks.
The third to the military conduct of the
object proposed?the wagons prepared,
escorted, loaded and returned. At a
glance,.see the science involved?first the
organization of 20 lads into appropriate
department^, the minute study of humah
nature required. Next the Geological
nature of the country operated on. The
Botanical character of the timber to be
used. The Mechanical Philopdphy of its
streeti and tension. The Chemical, .nature
of the implements employed. The
best application of them, &c* This is
the first or senior class?could the same
method, certainly, or energy be elicited
from any other than a corps d'arme ? ?

principles upon which the . two. higher
classes practiced?and taught in these by
details, from the elder and better scholars
of these higher classes, as pursued at
West Point, the expense of tuition being
thereby sayed to the State. What the
freshman class? Drawing, French, Spanish
and the Drills, Fencingss, dtc. appertaining
to an accomplished education;
the tastes and habits of youth, constitute
their surest mentors. This, for a partial

But our State has been celebrated for its
patronage of Military Schools. Captain
' Partridge's was supported by it. The
Rice Creek Springs.established and. fos
tered by it. The vacancies at the Federal
School always supplied?and. this
even for the smattering of the science of
war. Now, when it is supposed that the
most efficient Ci**il and Military Engineers
in the world may be enlisted in the
advancement of the present plart, if merely
as an example to the States of the Union
there is a fearful dread. Although Mr.
Calhoun, Qen. M'Duffie, Gen. Hamilton,
Dr. Cooper, and all of the most distinguished
youflg men of the. State are in
i favor of this.measure it is doubted. Is ;t
I that the President of the College objects?
N i?t so. It is well known that Gen. Bns
I bane declined as a candidate for the office
; of Adjutant General, because President
Baruwell refused to advocate the bill, unless
he did; and* in advancing it, assumed
that when the youth of the College should
be made acquainted with the. t science of
war, they would be.above the mocking of
a solemn responsibility?and after returning
to the classic course* would put
by >ne discipline of the camp?so inconsistent
with the character of the Classic
Student.
It is feared that the citizens of Columbia
are opposed to this mensjre?they
must study the objections set forth in my
former paper, and then see if in contending
lor too much, they do not lose the
winter term as well as summer. "The
period of youth is the period (or intellectual
and moral culture." It is dangerous
to attempt its diversion in these days of
reform. Time will not admit of an increase
of duties imposed on the classic
term, they must We effected in an extra
term or not at all. The additions, proposed
by the Governor, are allowed, !>y
all, to be important. Why not appropriate
an extra term to trtcrn?

of business during the first weok or ten days of overy
session, 'fhe only business yet attended to, is the
appointment of Committees, the receiving and reference
of reports, petitions, and presentments, together
with the election of A few Commissioners in
Equity. A number of important Bills have been introduced,
but as their fate is problematical, wc have
not thought it worth while to enumerate them. We
shall, however, keep our ro adore advised of the proceedings
of the Legislature, so far as they may mature
their measures; they will hardly thank us for
telling them all that may be attempted, but will be
satisfied With kriowing what is done.
A public dinner was given to Gen. Hayne, at
Nashville, Tenn. on the 26th ult. Gen. Hayne, it
I win bo recollected, was appointed at tbc meeting at
Flat Rock, N. C., of the Stockholders of thfl Louis,
ville, Cincinnati, and Charleston Rail Road Company,
to attend the Legislature of Tennessee, for the
purposo of endeavoring to get that State to grant
the Company Banking privileges, and we learn that
the Select Committee to which the subject was re.
ferred, havo reported a Bill to confer Ranking privileges
on the Company, under the corporate name of
the "South Western Rail Road Bonk," which was
road a first time and passed.
REVOLT IN CANADA.
The civil war in Canada, is still going on, and
from the latest accounts, the Government will find
more difficulty in sustaining its authority than was
at first anticipated. The patriots (as the revolutionists
are called) and tho loyalists havo had a brush,
in which the latter wero defeatod, with the loss of
sixteen killed, besides a number wounded.
Wm. LAVal Esq., late Comptroller Goncral, has
boon elected by the Legislature, Treasurer of the
Lower Division.
The following Resolutions hnvo boon reputed by
the Special Committee, in the House of Represents,
tivos, to whoni that portion of the Governor's Message,
in relation to the Currency was referred. They
were to have been considered yesterday.
"Resolved, That in the Opinion of this Legisla.
turo, it is expedient that the revenues of the Federal
Government be so collected as ultimately to sevor
the government from all connexion with the banks.
"Resolved, That in the opinion of this Legislature
the revenues of the Federal Government should be so
deposited, kept and disbursed, as not to be counseled
with, or used in banking operations.
"Resolved, That it would be unconstitutional, In*

in/ 01 muting exertions to improru our facilities
for communicating with North Cuolina, by turnpike
road from this place via Lancaster to the line
of that State, and all, so far at least, as we hare
heard, concur in desiring to see so important and
necessary an improvement accomplished* But not a
finger has been raised to promote it; no application
to the Legislature, no individual exertion, nothing in
fact, has hoen done, and wo fear nothing will be
done, until it is too late.
We have been led to those reflections by observing
among tho proceedings of the Legislature now in
sessiou, that Mr. Myers has introduced a Bill authorizing
the formation of a Company to cojistrcut a
turnpike road from Columbia to the North Carolina
linp. ? . ,
It is thus that Camden is kept in the back ground,
not from any naturul obstructions to her prosperity,
but from neglecting to use and to improve the facilities
which she possesses.
Let the people of Camden* and Kershaw, awake to
tnoir true interest*. Wc are too muoh in the habit
of supposing our individual interest too slight, and too
remotely connected with the improvements demanded
by the spirit of the ago, to'coinmaod the exercise of
all our energies to push them forward. This is a
