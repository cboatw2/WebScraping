MINORITY REPORT.
Of the Comnittee of Ways and Means, of
the House of Rrpresentutives, of the U.
States, on the Assumption of State
Debts.
The minority of the Committee of Ways
and S!eans, assenting to most of the rea
sons and to the conclusion presented in
the report ofthe majority against the pray
er of the memorialists, asking theFederal
Government to issue 8200,000,000 of pub
lie stock in aid of the debts of the States,
would also urge. in addition,.(without pre
teding to go into anything like a full
development of their reasons,) that they
deem the exercise of such a power on the
part of the General Government unauthor
fted by the Constitution.
The mittority have always been induced
tobelieve that the Federal Constitution
was a compact to which the States acce
ded, and became parties; and that the
powers of the Government necrued froin
that compact. and were defiued in it. B,
fees Congress is authorized to act upon
any sulject-matter. it must first be such a
subject. over which power is specifically
pauted in that instrument, ofclearly to be
inferred as absolutely necgsaary to carrv
out sme granted power. They can see
no positive grant of power to Congress to
authoriae them to do what the memorital
ists desire.
To assume such a debt and to create
such a stock, binding upon posterity. is a
very high exercise of sovereian pbwer.
and is is itself, independent atal substm.-I
tie. and ,aunut be inferred as incidental
to a grant over inferior subjects.
There is a clause in the Ctstittvon
which declares that "Congrcss shall have
power to lay and collect taxes, duties, im
post,. and excises, and provide for the
common defence and general welfitre
cf the United States," (Sec. 5 ) This
power was not given to pay the debts of
the several States of this union, but the
debts of the "United States." Theso
word. define the confederacy of States
as a whole, and as contradtistinguished
bom the seperate and independent States.
To assume that this power was given to
authorize the Government to pay the
debts of the separate States contracted
solely for their benefit and for their local
purposes, is to allow the different States
ts contractdebtsand,through the Poderal
Qeerament, to bind others to pay them;
whih would make this Government
mubsorvient to local interests and to State
theris, and absorb "the general wel
eoeL United States." If this should
be shs.tabuhld niple of the Govern
m t kct5 stimula '
i which would ineyiably end
is their seperate existence, or in a consoli
danted despotism, where even their bonn
daries would he forgotten amid the uni
versa! despair that would folluw the over
threw of constittional liberty.
Tho terms "general welfare." in the
Constitution, were designed as a mere do
claration of extteme caution ; and the true
inteet and meaning of those who used
thim was, that they should be a limitation
to the apparently absolute and onenntrol
led power iven t uthe samne clause--"to
lay and Coll t taxes," "to pay the'debts,"
kc. it was intended that this power
should not be @sedl wantonly or unjustly ;
bet that Congress should strictly cont'ult
the "generaltaelfare of the United States,"
and carry out the same only e: ontinu
ing its full exercise so objects especially
conmerated in that instrumeint, and w hich
are thereby declared to be national.
These powers were not intended to be
applied to local interests, or to State debts;
bat to those great national objects whicht
-we,. specially declared by grats of pow
er to be within the jurnsdiction of the
General Government.
it is notn denied that thtis Cuveranent
is one of limi'ed powers, and thzit the
Constitution is inteuded to deffne those'
powers. By merely assumiuz that it is
natinal, you cannot ell'et tobjects ntt
enumerated. or not essentially ne~cessary
to those that are. The convention which
has precisely defined those objects or
powers that are national, and Congress
cant legally undertake to declare wha&t
oball also be nattonal for other purposes
not defined in the Constitution.
To do'so, is to do nothing more nor
less than to claitm that Congress shall set
up ita owc discretion as to the obijects of
"general welfare,'' instead of confioing its
acton to the specifie enumerated powers
of the Constitution itself, if the "general
welfare" he the wily limitation on the
diseration of Congress, why then any en
umeration of powers at all? All power was
at once given, and the judgement of Con
gpe. was shreeby declared to ho the Con
eituia of the confederacy. What right
have we to set aside the judgment of the
coavention? They chose by enumera
ti the powers, to show what were inten
se be national objects; and the very
enumeration excludes the idea of legisla
tia upon subjects not enumerated.
Tb. minortty consider te proposition
to giedge the faith of this Government for
the redemption of $200,000,000 of public
steck to relieve the States, or pay their
debts, as involving the whole taxing pow
er of this Government.
It is a proposition to tax posterity not for
the existence and independlence of the
confederacy, hut for purposes unknown to
the Constitution, and at war with those
principles of liberty which secure to a free
people the practical right to tax themselves
alone, and to be proteeted from the law
less pediigacy of those who may have
aumed to hind them in all future time.
In all eiviliaed countries, the line whbich
limits the power of Government as a tax
.en. is the line that defincs enlightene~d
liberty. There are some of the States that
ie nothing, and many but little; and to
mompol thorn to become jointly liable, by
the action of this Federal Goverment
ror the debts of the other States, woold be
an act of such gross injustice to them, that
it would create feelings hostile to the per
manency of the Union. The etrength of
Dur Union consists in the Gevernmeut ac
ting with wise forbearance upon subjects
of doubtful import-in doiu; exact justice
to all the parties-in imposimg equal bur
dons-and mildly shedding around equal
blessings upon all. By sucha course,it will
generate feelings of devoted attachment in
loyal and free people. who will be ever
ready to defend it from aggressious abroad,
or from treason at home.
The strength of the Government does
not consist in arbitrary or great power, but
in the attachment ofan intelligent people
to thoso great principles which make
them free and equal. If the Government
assumes a doubtful power. the exercise of
which creates palpable injustice to whole
communities, its operation will attenuate
the feelings of those who suffer, and los
en the bonds that keep the confederacy
togrther.
The creation of such a Goverament
debt would only end in taxing the pro -
ductive industry, of the country fur the
beneflt of stockholders and speculators.
Those who deal in Government funds. and
live by the fluctuations of paper, might
amass fortunes; but the great laboring
class would be beyond the reach of its
benefits, whilst they would be made final
ly to feel its burdens, in the future taxa
tion of the Government to meet the vast
ubligation thus incurred. It is wild and
visionary to soprose that the creation of
uch stock would add anything to the
national wealth. It %nuld only tend
to make she industrious and solvent liable
for the debt% of the ubandoned and profli
gate. The first immediate ef1Tet would
be to swell expansion, and stimulate a
bluated paper currenry, which would be
felt in foreign exchan;cs setting agaitnst us.
and a conm-quent detmand for gold anti
.ilver to adjus b.alncecs. It nauld phice
nur ioral rutercncv above de lecel of ite
cirrency of the worid, and ern'te a drain
for our specie io egnalizo it. This, of
roursr, would ine itably end in explosion.
like the Missi-sippi bubble or the French
a4%itats. Without intending to go into
i full argnment. but merely to suggest the
Keueral ground.s of opposition. the iniu
rity look upon the % hole theme as un
constititional. wild, and visionary, and
ull of frand and the grossest injustice.
The undersigned. therefore, pmpose
that the realttion of the comtinittee he
ameided, by adding thereto the following
wordi:

overtbrown the greit principtes of th.
Dmocratic party. and in his percou they

its, is n superficial view of the subject
Our priuciples are not repr set:ted by hi;
tactts, %%orth or services. Nor are wc to
repine, t'ccauso we suffered defeat in the P
person of ay particular man. The man
sinks into -gue'-wosignid6canco compared P
with the gre2: ends for which the party '
