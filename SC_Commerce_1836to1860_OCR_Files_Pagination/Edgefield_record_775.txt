Neveri~eless. it is undoubted, that Mr.

of the inhabitants being at the time en

Imprisoning a matister Of the gospel
for debt.-We perceive by the last Ra
leigh Star, that the Rev. A. J. Battle, a
divine of talents and becoming christiau
meekness,. has been snatched from his
home, from all the endearments of wife
and children, and cast into the Raleigh
jail! We' know.not at whose instance
cortainly however at the instance of no
person but , such as the' ferncious
hyena wu'm ' to asociate with
certainly, aw instance of no man who
t not governed, ruled and led by the
Demon of the neit ber world-nowe know
not or.we would trumpet his name to the
four corners of the world. Let Carolina
blush over the law that tears a Pastor
from Iis congregation. his wife and his
childron, and thrusts him like a brute or
a murderer within the walls of a filthy
prison! lre is a man who has reduced
himself to naked poverty by his seal in the
cause of Christianity-he went to Raleigh
in 1839, w here he contracted for the build
ing of a Baptist Church, relyin- on the
liherality of the friends of Christianity for
moioy to pay the cost-tlie churea was
built-tho man of God went abroad and
::'d hie christian aned the philanthropist
to contribute a tiife towa'rd psayic forit
but avarice spurned his entreaties I H%
returned hoe and sold his property,every
thing, not even reserving a bed for hi
wife and children to repose upon at night
-but this did not satisfy the debt : He
then asked tbo creditor to indulge him, to
give him time to labor so as to enable him
to raise mnyto iay the bialance-the
creditor assure him tht the claim' should
stand until lie could make ii convenient to
pay; tauder this assurance bequits Raleigh
rind locates in Wih~uington. herm he
meets with kind friends, and besides serv
ing in the capacity of preacher he carries
on a Commission business-pow he begins
to make a little mnoney, and now tha his
ereditor has him arrested' on a Ca. Sa.
he gives bond for his appear'anbe at court
in Raleigh-lie appears, bitt canont hear
the mortelication of the insolvent oath,'aitd
hopes to compromise witht piong into
this alternai've-byt.- al'as'! iii' is seizdsd

h(ow long sha~ll the staiute beet~ ol
Nort h Carolina be cursed with thatabmni
nable law n hich confines a man in prisotn
for debts 1 Can it be, that in this boased~
age the people lack sagacity to see that
by the rearing a man f'rom hans family ant
the means of employment and locking; him
up in jail it will not add to the paymnenrol
his debtsi Then indeed is 'the school
