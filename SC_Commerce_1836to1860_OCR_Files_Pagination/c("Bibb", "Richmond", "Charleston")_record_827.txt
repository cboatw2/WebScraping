OBITUARY.
" Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord. ”
For the Southern Christian Advocate.
Died, on the 25th March, Asbury Coke, eldest
son of Raleigh Greene, aged twenty-two years, and
nearly six months. He was baptized in infancy by
Bishop McKendree, and grew up full of promise.—
His natural disposition was remarkably kindly, and
his conduct as a school-boy won the affections of
all his acquaintance. But, though his life was un
exceptionable, and prayer his regular habit, yet his
parents had fears, lest he might lean upon that false
prop for salvation. It was our daily prayer, that he
might be led as an humble mourner to the foot of the
cross, and be made a partaker of the grace of God,
by faith in Jesus. It pleased the Lord to begin a
most gracious revival of his work in the church in
Salem, near which we then resided in the summer
of 1841; and Asbury was deeply awakened ; he
was truly a mourner; he was “ weary and heavy
laden,” and at times, despair seemed almost to rest
upon his soul. But the night passed: he found
rest. Our youngest child at that time, was at the
point of death, and on the 11th of September died.
It was a most glorious and awful night to us all,
and my son shouted the f>raises of God until nearly
exhausted.
His younger sister, Amelia Capers, and himself
joined the church on the same night: and a pious
friend most feelingly remarked, “you have joined
the church at the same time, but which shall be
taken first 1” Asbury, when he became a member
of the church, had a proper regard to the responsi
bilities which are involved in that relation, and had
determined to take up every cross, and discharge
all the duties which should be required of him.—
Among his youthful friends he would engage in
prayer; in love-feasts he stood up as a witness for
God : which much surprised us, as he was a young
man of remarkably unobtrusive, retiring disposi
tion.
From the time of his making a public profession
of religion, until his lamented departure, his course
was straight-forward, and his “ heart was fixed,”
to serve the'Lord. He was not allowed, however,
a long education for heaven: a few years finished
his preparation. Some time last summer, he was
attacked with influenza, from which he never en
tirely recovered. In the early part of the present
month, his disease rallied ; and although all that
medical skill and close attention could do to stay
the hand of death was done ; all was in vain.
I saw his change was near, and informed him of
the fact: I asked, “ my son do you feel that you are
prepared to go, if the Lord should call you.” He
replied with great humility and composure, “I hope
I am.” I asked, “My son, have you a consciousness
of having the presence of God now!” said he, “I
trust so; I know I have.” I inquired, “ When be
fore you were taken ill, did you realize the presence
of God!” “ Not long since, Pa, I had the greatest
blessing I ever enjoyed.”
The Rev. W. R. Singleton called in and con
versed with him. To all his affectionate enquiries,
he gave the most satisfactory answers. Brother
S. asked “Do you have peace with God through
our Lord Jesus Christ!” He quickly replied, “I
do;” and said he, “ I love God and all his people.”
Brother S. gave out the hymn commencing with
“ On Jordan’s stormy banks I stand,’’ &c.
He joined in the singing of a part of the hymn with
an unusual strength of voice, and especially when
the fifth stanza was being sung, his soul was in a
rapture ; and he raised his arms and beckoned to
me. I approached, he caught me in his arms, and
praised the Lord with all his remaining strength.—
He lingered until a little after ten o’clock, P. M.,
and the weary wheels of life stood still. We can
have no doubt that he is now amongst the heavenly
host, “blessing and praising God,” with his glorified
relations who have gone before. Our loss is se
verely felt: but we trust the Lord Jesus will sus
tain us by his grace, and enable us to say,—“ The
Lord gave : and the Lord hath taken away : bles
sed be the name of the Lord.”

Mrs. C. was & member of the Methodist Episco.

three years, and from the time of her profession of
religion to her departure from earth, her piety was
of the most uniform and lovely character; her pri
vate devotions were strictly and conscientiously
observed. The exercises of religion, whether of
a private, social or public character were precious
to her soul. By example, by prayer, by bind counsel
tand affectionate solicitations, she sought to allure
the young to the paths of peace, and lead them to
the Redeemer. In seasons of special or extraor
dinary manifestations of the spirit and power of
God, she deeply felt the presence of God. Emphati
cally may it be said of her, she loved, and enjoyed
religion. Hers was a life of faith, of unshaken
faith in her Redeemer.

DR. DODDRIDGE’S DREAM.
Dr. Doddridge had been spending the even
ing with his friend Dr. Watts. Their conver
sation had been concerning the future existence
of the soul. Long and earnestly they pursued
the theme; and both came to the conclusion,
irather a remarkable one for theologians of that
ay to arrive at,) that it could not be they were
to sing through all eternity ; that each soul
must necessarily be an individual, and have its
appropriate employment for thought and affec
tion. As Doddridge walked home, his mind
brooded over these ideas, and took little cogni
zance of outward matters. In this state he laid
his head upon the pillow, and fell asleep. He
dreamed that he was dying. He saw his weep
ing friends round his bedstead, and wanted to
speak to them, but could not. Presently there
came a nightmare sensation. His soul was
about to leave the body; but how could it get
out? More and more anxiously rose the query,
how could it get out? This uneasy state passed
away; and he found that his soul had left his
body. He himself stood beside the bed, looking
at his own corpse, as if it were an old garment,
laid aside as useless. His friends wept round
tne mortal covering, but could not see him.
While he was reflecting upon this, he passed
out of the room he knew not how ; but presently
he found himself floating over London, as if pil
lowed on a cloud borne by gentle breezes. Far
below him, the busy multitude were hurrying
hither qpd thither, like rats and mice scampering
for crumbs. ‘Ah!’ thought the emancipated
spirit,1 how worse than foolish appears this fool
ish scramble! For what do they toil, and what
do they obtain?’
London passed away beneath him, and he
found himself floating over green fields and
blooming gardens. ‘ How is it that I am borne
through the air?’ thought he. He looked, and
saw a large purple wing: and then he knew that
he was carried by an angel. ‘ Whither are we
going?’ said he. ‘ To Heaven !’ was the reply.
He asked no more questions, but remained m
delicious quietude, as if they floated on a strain
of music. At length they paused before a white
marble temple of exquisite beauty. The angel
lowered his flight and gently placed him on the
steps. ‘ I thought you were taking me to hea
ven,’ said the spirit. ‘ This is heaven,’ replies
the angel. ‘This! Assuredly this temple is
of rare beauty, but I could imagine just such
built on earth.’ ‘Nevertheless, it is heaven,’ re
plied the angel.
They entered a room just within the temple.
A table stood in the centre, on which was a gol
den vase, filled with sparkling wine,‘Drink of
this,’ said the angel, offering the vase; ‘for all
who would know spiritual things, must first
drink of spiritual wine.’ Scarcely had the ruby
liquid wet his lips, when the Saviour of men
stood before him, smiling most benignly. The
spirit instantly dropped on his knees and bowed
down his head before Him. The holy hands of
thje Purest were folded over him in blessing; and
his voice said,—‘ You will sec me seldom now ;
hereafter you will see me more frequently. In
the mean time, observe well the wonders of this
temple.'
The sound ceased. The spirit remained
awhile in silence. When ho raised his head,
the Saviour no longer appeared. He turned to
ask the angel what this could mean; but the
angel had departed also,—the soul stood alone,
in its own unveiled presence ! ‘ Why did the
Holy One tell me to observe well the wonders of
this temple?’ thought he. He looked slowly
round. A sudden start of joy and wonder!
There, painted on the walls, in most marvellous
beauty, stood the whole of his spiritual life.—
Every doubt, and every clear perception; every
conflict and every victory, were there before
him! and though forgotten for years, he knew
them at a glance. Even thus had a sunbeam
pierced the darkest cloud, and thrown a rainbow
bridge from the finite to the infinite; thus had he
slept peacefully in green valleys, by the side of
running brooks ; and such had been his visions
from the mountain tops. He knew them all.
They had been always painted within the cham
bers of his soul; but now for the first time, was
the veil removed.
To those who think on spiritual things this
remarkable dream is too deeply and beautifully
significant ever to be forgotten.
“We shape ourselves the joy and fear,
Of which the coming life is mode,
And fill our future atmosphere
With sunshine or with shade.
Still shall the soul around it call
The shadows which it gathered here}
And, painted on the eternal wall,
The past shall re-appear.”
THE PHANTOM SHIP.
In Bacon’s Historical Discourses we find an
account of a singular incident or phenomenon,
which occurred in the early history of New
Haven. The enterprising colonists sought to
build up their town, beautifully laid out, by an
active commerce, both foreign and domestic.
But failing in their efforts, and having met with
various disasters, the company of merchants uni
ted their resources in building and loading out
a ship for England, to try if any better success
might befall them.
“ Into this ship,” says an ancient historian,
“ they put in a manner all their tradeable estates,
much corn, and large quantities of plateand
among the seventy that embark for the voyage,
are several “ of very precious account" in the
colony. In the month of January, 1646, the
harbor being frozen over, a passage is cut
through the ice, with saws, for three miles; and
“the great ship,” on which so much depends, is
out upon the waters, and ready to begin her
voyage.
Mr. Davenport and a great company of the
people go out upon the ice, to give the last fare
well to their friends. The pastor, in solemn
pTayer, commends them to the protection of God,
and they depart. The winter passes away; the
ice-bound harbor breaks into ripples before the
soft breezes of the spring. Vessels from Eng
land arrive on the coast; but they bring no
tidings of the New-Haven ship. Vain is the
solicitude of wives and children, of kindred and
friends. Vain are all inquiries.
. “ They ask the waves, they ask the (felon winds,
And question every gUBt of rugged winds
That blows from off each beaked promontory.”
Month after month, Hope waits for tidings.
Affection, unwilling to believe the worst, frames
one conjecture and another to account for the de
lay. Perhaps they have been blown out of
their track upon some undiscovered shore, from
which they will by and by return, to surprise us
with their safety:—perhaps they nave been cap
tured, and are now in confinement. How many
prayers are offered for the return of that ship,
with its priceless treasures of life and affection!
At last, anxiety gradually settles down into
despair. Gradually they learn to speak of the
wise and public-spirited Gregson, the brave and
soldier like Turner, the adventurous Lanberton,
that “right godly woman" the wife of Mr.
Goodyear, and the others, as friends whose faces
are never more to be seen among the living. In
November, 1647, their estates are settled, and
they are put upon record as deceased. Yet they
were not forgotten; but long afterwards, the un
known melancholy fate of those who sailed in
LambeTton’s ship threw its gloomy shadow over
many a fireside circle.
Two years and five months from the sailing of
that ship, in an afternoon in June, after a thun
der storm, not far from sunset, there appeared
over the harbor of New-Haven, the form of the
keel of a ship with three masts, to which were
suddenly added all the tackling and sail: and
presently after, upon the highest part of the deck,
a man standing with one hand leaning against his
left side, and in h is right hand a sword pointing to
wards the sea. The phenomenon continued about
a quarter of an hour, and was seen by a crowd
of wondering witnesses—till at last, from the
farther side of the ship, there arose a great smoke
which covered all the ship ; and in that smoke
she vanished away. Fifty years afterwards, while
several of the witnesses of this strange appear
ance were yet alive, the story was reported by
some of the survivors, that Mr. Davenport pub
licly declared “ that God had condescended to
give, for the quieting of their afflicted spirits, this
extraordinary account of his disposal of those
for whom so many prayers had been offered,"—

DR. BRADLEY IN THE GREAT BAZAAR
AT BANGKOK.
On the 31st August, Dr. Bradley writes that
the panic which had existed in reference to the
circulation of Tracts and books in Siam had
nearly or quite subsided, and the people were
surprised to learn that the missionaries had still
the friendship of the king. “ Persons from all
parts of the kingdom” were calling on him “ at
the Tract House,” and the people manifested
“more confidence in him as teacher, and were
more ready to sit down and talk with him about
Christ than formerly.” He adds,
“ It is not improbable that the constant exer
cise of my preaching abilities in a foreign tongue
has increased these powers, and made them more
effective in getting and holding the attention of
my hearers. Be this as it may, it is quite cer
tain I have more quiet, orderly and attentive au
diences than before.
“ I aim to be on the ground punctually at a
certain hour, on four days of every week. It is
seldom that I fail of doing this. I then endea
vour, as a settled plan, to preach very briefly yet
distinctly the divinity of Christ: that he is the
Maker and sustainer of all things ; that he, see
ing the world ruined by sin, came in human
nature, and suffered and gave himself a sacrifice
for man ; that he rose from the dealt on the third
day, that he ascended to heaven, and now reigns
Lord over all; that he has commissioned his
servants to go every where preaching, saying,
1 He that believeth and is baptized shall be sav
ed, but he that believeth not shall be damned.’ ”
“ When I have preached this short sermon of
five or six minutes, if I perceive a hearing ear I
enlarge upon the topics; but if the audience is
noisy, and the demand for books is strong and
impatient of delay, I consider it an indication
that I should dispense the word by distributing
Tracts and printed portions of the Bible, enjoin
ing it on every one to read for the life of his soul,
and practise what he reads. When this compa
ny have retired, and others come in, I preach
substantially the same sermon again, endeavour
ing to make all hear and understand so much of
the Gospel that the blood of their souls cannot
at last be found in my skirts,—so much, that not
one of them can say at last that he never had an
opportunity to learn that Jesus Christ is the true
Lord, and is able and willing to save every pen
itent sinner ; in a word, I try to fulfil my com
mission as I read in Mark xvi. 16.
“ I often ask questions, and awaken attention
in this way. I hesitate not to tell all classes that
they are believing a lie, and must be damned to
all eternity, unless they repent and turn to Jesus.
Some appear to listen to such announcements
Others seem to lay them up in their hearts, and
say one to another, ‘ It is probably true.' Oth
ers again are enraged, and loudly curse the
preacher and his adorable Lord, "and if they
have a Tract they will as likely as not, tear it to
pieces before his eyes, and scatter the fragments
in the street. Scarcely anything is so painful to
me, which is of frequent occurrence, and still 1
am constrained to think that it tends directly to
make Christ known to the people, and induces
others to come in to hear what the ‘ babbler’
saith, and finally take books, who would not
otherwise do so.”
The work of the American Tract Society
abroad is to strengthen the hands of such labour
ers as Dr. Bradley, and to aid all our foreign
missionaries and evangelical labourers on the
continent of Europe by Tracts and books, to be
used wherever adapted to gain access to the
minds of the people. Many thousands of dol
lars are yet needed to fill up the Society’s ap
propriations for the year now drawing to a close.
THE GUILLOTINE.
The London Quarterly Review for December
contains an elaborate but interesting article upon
the systematized murders by the guillotine, the
origin of the barbarous instrument, and other
matters connected with this most terrible feature
in the history of the French revolution. The
guillotine, it appears, was not originally designed,
with any view to what turned out to be its most
important characteristic,—the great number of
victims that it could execute in a short space of
time,—but this Moody instrument was at first
proposed on a combined principle of justice and
mercy the inventor contending that hanging was
a lingering and cruel punishment, while death
by decapitation must be immediate.
After giving much infonnatioa in relation to
this sanguinary machine, the writer of the article,
speaking of the position it occupied in France,
says that the guillotine remained in permanence
in the celebrated “ Place de la Revolution" until
June 8th, 1792, when the inhabitants of the street
through which the sufferers had to pass, being
weary of the heart-rending sight, resolved that
the cruel instrument should be removed to the
“Place St Antoine,” in front of the ruins of the
Bastile.—It stood in this new position, however,
but five days, the shopkeepers not liking their
new neighbour, and having in these brief five
days executed ninety-six persons, it was removed
to the “ Barriere du Trone,” where it stood from
the 9th of June to the fall of Robespierre, 27th
July, 1794.
In the forty-nine days, in which it is said to
have stood at the “Barriere du Trone,” it des
patched 1270 persons, of both sexes, and of all
ages and ranks, and it became necessary to build
a kind of sanguiduct to carry off the streams of
blood; and on the very day when Robespierre
fell,—even when the slightest interruption would
have sufficed to stop the fatal procession,—forty
nine persons passed to the place of execution!
On the 27th day of July, at about half past three
in the afternoon, just as this last batch of victims
were about to leave the Conciergierie, a consid
erable commotion in the town took place, caused
by the revolt against Robespierre.
Here an event occurred which reflected great
credit upon Sanson, the chief executioner. He
was conducting the prisoners, but observing the
disturbance and seeing Fauquier, the accusateur
publique, passing the court where the prisoners
were ascending the fatal carts on his way to din
ner, he ventured to stop Fauquier and represent
ed to him that there were rumours of a commo
tion, suggesting whether it would not be prudent
to postpone the execution, at least until the next
morning. Fauquier roughly replied that the
law must take its course. He went to dinner,
and forty-nine victims went to the scaffold,—
whither, in due time, he followed them!
The next day the guillotine was removed
back to the scene of its longest triumphs,—the
“Place de la Revolution"—where on the 28th
of July it avenged humanity on Robespierre and
twenty-one of his followers; the next day sixty
nine and the day after thirteen more of his asso
ciates.—The writer in the Quarterly justly adds
that though France is naturally anxious to forget
these revolutionary horrors, it behoves the rest
of Europe to remember and meditate upon
them.—Boston Transcript.
From Africa's Luminary.
A TIMELY RESCUE.
While the U. S. Squadron was laying at Cape
Palmas, the Commodore and several of his offi
cers being on shore, Governor Roberts with
them, they received information that the cruel
ceremony of drinking Sassy-wood,, was then
taking place at a native town quite near the cape.
Most of our readers perhaps are acquainted with
l the nature of this piece of heathenish barbarity.
When a native dies, his townsmen conclude that
he died of witchcraft and there is always ready
| at hand some one to originate suspicion respect
ing the supposed murderer. The poor victim on
whom these suspicions rest, is apprehended, and
beforeanimmensemultitude is compelled to drink
draught after draught of an infusion ofthe bark of
the sassy-wood as it is termed by the natives. This
bark possesses strong poisonous qualities, and
the poor sufferer in a few hours dies a painful and
horrid death. The practice is not unfrequently
used to get rid of some useless member of t he com
munity, whom they imagine has lived too long
already. So it was in the case above referred to.
A poor old man, was accused of having witched
the deceased, and he must pass through the dread
ful ordeal. They had assembled and he had al
ready drank alarge quantity ofthe infusion; when
commodore Perry and his company hastened to the
spot. Seeing them approaching and conjectu
ring that a rescue was intended, the natives thrust
the poor half dead victim into a canoe, put in a
couple of their best paddlers and away they were
bearing him on the lagoon which extends several
miles down the coast. But the benevolent inten
tions of the party were not to be so easily baffled.
Commodore Perry caused two of their head men
to be seized and declared his purpose of taking
them on board his vessel, and there keeping them,
unless the poor fellow was immediately returned
and his freedom secured to him. This produced
the effect immediately. The man was returned
—providentially relieved by some antidote ad
ministered by a physician, restored, and set at
liberty.
BRANDY.
Brandy is the favorite liquor among those who
are fond of ardent spirit, it is thought by some
to have valuable digestive and antibiliary pro
perties. Brandy therefore, is placed upon the
table when fish, or poultry, and especially ducks
or geese are to be devoured ; and in most cases
where rich and oily sauces areemployed,though
as a celebrated physician very good-humoredly
said on a certain occasion, the man who would
take brandy under the idea that it would digest
goose, must be a goose himself.
Brandy is renowned for its exciting—may we
not say its maddening properties? Hence it is
resorted to by those who would be inspired with
supernatural feelings—who would banish reflec
tion—who would raise their minds to that degree
of courage, we suppose they call it—necessary
to the performance of uncommon brutality and
ruffian daring. Brandy, therefore, is in request
by burglars, highway robbers, and midnight as
sassins.
Brandy is famous for its cold-repelling pro
perties. Hence the flask or the “ pocket pistol,”
loaded with this elixir, is found in the side pock
et of the traveller, not only in the cold regions of
the north, but in all climates and seasons of the
year. Anti-temperance travellers, in the cold
seasons, are said to have a marvellous predilec-1
tion for a tumbler full of good brandy and wa- J
ter, made hot; though we have known instan
ces in which the same gentlemen, at another
season of the year, when the weather is hot and
sultry order a glass of cold brandy and water,
without sugar, for the purpose, as we suppose,
of cooling them. Temperance travellers have
made the experiment on a large scale, and they
have proved to a demonstration, that the popular
notion is an absolute fallacy; that brandy, or
any other spirituous liquors, so far from repelling
cold, opens the pores of the body and exposes it
to imminent danger; and that in cases of ex
treme cold, or exposure to weather, those persons
have always been the most safe and the most
comfortable, who have had nothing to do with
these delusive and destructive stimulants.
‘ ROW ON.’
1 For the first five years of my professional
life,’ once said a gentleman to us,11 had to row
against wind and steam and tide.’ And what
did you do?’ was our question. ‘ Do,’ replied
he, ‘ do, why I rowed on to be sure.’—And so he
did row on, and to a good purpose too, until he
came to the open sea, took favorable breezes, and
brought his voyage to a most successful termina
tion, leaving him a most enviable reputation of
word and wisdom, impressing the mark of hi*
strong mind and excellent character deep and
clear on the community in which he livea, and
obtaining an immortality worth more than a mon
arch’s crown in the respectful memory of thou
sands. His remark deserves to be remembered
as a motto. The great business of all is to ‘ row
on’ with unflinching courage and steady perse
verance. All trades and professions have their
difficulties, and almost every individual meets
yvith discouragements. The only way, therefore,
is to go adead, and ‘ row on.’ Decision ol char
acter, determination of will, the resolution to
press on when sure we are on the right track or
in pursuit of a good and honorable end, this is the
secret of living so as to come out at last and
sound. There are ‘ lions' in every path, and
they must be met and conquered, or the hope of
ultimate success must be abandoned.—A poor
man, with a tribe of children, finding work hard
to get and hard when it is got, sometimes will
almost despair; every thing will seem to be
against him, but let him not be cast down_let
him • row on,’ and by and by matters will very
likely grow brighter. As with the poor men so
with all men.—Head winds are to be expected;
contrary currents will come ; the tides do not
always run with us; but never mind/ row on ;’
pull the harder, till the oars bend again and vic
tory will wait upon and reward patient endeavors.
Those who have arisen from obscurity to emi
nence—those who, from being poor, have become
rich—those who, born in the midst of ignorance,
have forced their way among the learned—those
who have made themselves well, have generally
been those who understood the importance of
‘ rowing on.’ * Faint heart never won a fair
lady,’ nor anything else.
TEA AS A NUTRITIVE SUBSTANCE.
Chambers’s Edinburg Journal gives the fol
lowing in relation to the principles of the Chi
nese herb:
At a recent meeting of the Paris Academy of
Science, M. Peligot read a paper on the chemical
combination of tea. M. Peligot states that tea
contains essential principles of «utrition far ex
ceeding in importance its stimulating properties;
and shows that, as a stimulant, tea is in every
respect the most desirable object of habitual use.
One of his experiments upon the nutritive quali
ties of tea, as compared with those of soup, was
by no means in favour of the latter. The most
remarkable products of tea are: 1st, the tannin
or astringent property; 2d, an essential oil to
which it owes its aroma, and which has a great
influence on its price in commerce; and 3d, a
substance rich in azote, and chrystallizable, call
ed theine, which is also met in coffee, and is fre
quently called cafeine. Independently of these
three substances, there are eleven others of less
importance, which enter more or less into the
composition of tea of all the kinds imported into
Europe. What was more essential, as regards
the chemical and hygienic character of the plant,
was to ascertain the exact proportion of the azo
ted (nitrogenized) principle it contains. M.
Peligot began by determining the total amount
of azote in tea, and finished by finding that it was
from 20 to 30 per cent, greater than in any other
kind of vegetable. M. Peligot states that by
reason of this quantity of azote, and the existence
of cafeine in the tea leaf, it is a true aliment.
TIME MUST BE ACCOUNTED FOR.
Time is a talent committed to man from God,
who will require an account of the disposal of a
blessing so valuable. Time is a universal tal
ent; all have not the talent of wealth, of wisdom,
of power, of authority, but all have a talent of
time ; and self-interest calls on man to make the
best of this talent. By it we are capable of in
creasing our everlasting happiness, or augment
ing our everlasting misery: and must account
for it with sadness or with joy. It should ever
be remembered, that we have not done with the
moments past. They are gone, but we shall
meet them again,—meet them at the bar of God,
where they will witness for us, or against us.
Solemn thought! Can we look back on time
and not dread to meet it at the judgment seat of
Christ? Can we bear the strict scrutiny of the
heart searching Judge?—Examine the book of
life, cast up your accounts,see what you have
gained by trading with this talent, that you may
know what account you are capable of render
ing. Let time murderers and robbers of God
remember,
“No moment’s granted man without account."
ABROAD AND AT HOME.
A gentleman who had been active in aiding a
missionary collection, was met the following
day by one of different habits, who chided him
with the folly of which hedcemed him guilty, in
giving to such an object, and in such prolusion.
It was folly, he said, to be sending heaps of
money abroad, to be spent, no one knew how-,
while there were so many unemployed starving
poor at home.
“ I will give £— to the poor of-, if you
will give an equal sum," said the Christian
friend. “ I did not mean that,” replied the ob
jector; “but,” continued he, “if you must go
from home, who so far ? Think of the miserable
poor of Ireland.” I will give £— to the poor of
Ireland, if you will do the same.” “I did not
mean that either,” was the reply. No, it is :
neither this nor that, which this class of objectors
exactly mean ; put simply to veil their covetous
ness, by blaming the proceedings of liberal men,
whom, if they did not condemn, they must for
very shame, in some degree imitate.
INUNDATION OF THE ZUIDER ZEE.
Previous to the latter part of the thirteenth
century nearly the whole of what is now called
the Zuider Zee was dry land. Intheyear 1287,
12.000 square miles of territory were inundated,
and 80,000 persons lost their lives by the catas
trophe. In 1570 an inundation occurred which
cut oft' 100,000 persons. Since that period sim
ilar disasters have been less frequent, owing to
the construction of dikes to keep back the swollen
waters. In 1809, however, owing to an unusual
rise in the Rhine, during the prevalence of a furi
ous gale fiom the North-west, the surface of the
Zuider Zee was elevated several feet above the
highest tides, the river dikes were destroyed, and
the destruction of life and property was tremen
dous. In the winter of 1825, Amsterdam it
self was threatened in like manner; and it is said
that if the tide had continued to rise for fifteen
minutes longer, this proud and rich city, with its
200.000 inhabitants, would have been submerged.
As it was, the destruction was very great in a
pecuniary point of view.
THE LOVE OF THE SPIRIT.
And then, there will be “the love of the
Spirit,” Rom. xv. 30. Can the Christian ever
forget the Holy One who strove with him, while
he was striving with his Maker ? Can he for
get who it was that disposed his heart to wel
come the Gospel, and that revealed Christ to
his soul? Can he forget that gracious Being
who condescended then to stoop to his mean
ness, his vileness, his misery; and ever since,
has cheered him amidst his conflicts, shielded
his head in the day of battle, and endeared to
him the'name of Jesus, and the memorials of
his love t Or, when he looks on a perishing
world, and remembers on whom the last hope
of that world depends, or views a half-awakened
church, and bears in recollection, that not a gift
from Heaven, not a time of refreshing, not a
season of revival has ever been realized, but that
the cause of the movement, the source of the
blessing, was “ that one and the self-same Spi
rit,”—Can he think of this, and forget the Holy
BORROWED JEWELRY.
At the recent examination in bankruptcy of
Charles Matthews, in London, it was said:—
“ Any one knowing the course of high life in
this world, must be aware that the jewelry
which decorated some of the most distinguished
personages in the land was no more their pro
perty than the horses and carriages which took
them to those assemblages. It was well known
that for several weeks previous to a drawing
room taking place, the metropolis was ransack
ed from one.end to the other, from the highest to
the lowest jewelers, and Messrs. Mortimer and
Hunt, he understood, lent out on hire many thou
sand pounds’ worth of diamonds on those occa
sions.
THE POOR FRENCHMEN.
Of nearly 33,000,000 persons in France,
says the Reforme, there are 27,000,000 who do
not drink wine; there are 31,000,000 who never
taste sugar; there are 20,000,000 who never
wear shoes; there are 31,000,000 who never
eat meat; there are 18,000,000 who never eat
wheaten bread; and, finally, there are 4,000,000
clothed in rags.
CHILDREN
THE VOYAGE.
“Against the law! against the law!” said a
little girl, “ I don’t like that ‘ against the law.’”
*But if our naughty hearts do not like to be
told that what we wish to do is against the law,
yet what would become of us if God had not
made good laws for us to keep: if He had not
warned us so solemnly that we shall be ruined,
unless we keep these laws!
In the Book of Proverbs, we read, “My son,
keep thy father’s commandment, and forsake not
the law of thy mother!”
I will tell you my story to show you what a
good law this is.
About thirty years ago, two little boys who
lived in the city of New-York, used to play a
great deal together. Their mothers had made
a law for these boys, that they should never play
near the river docks, nor go into any boats along
shore. They were too small to manage a boat
well, or to swim with their clothes on ; and so
this was a very good law. But they were
tempted one day to forsake it, and now see what
they got by it. After they had played a while
about the dock, they began to think how nice it
would be to take a sail. Now was the time to
have started home, out of the reach of the temp
tation. But presently they went near one of the
slips of the dock, (a slip is a kind of lane made
in the banks of the river for the boats to come
up into,) and there they saw some large planks
floating; “Come Billy,” said Thomas, who
had gone down to the water’s edge, “ how nice
it would be to paddle round the slip on a plank,
there can be no harm in that!” So Billy and
Thomas got a bit of board and seated themselves
astraddle upon a plank with their feet in the wa
ter. They paddled and paddled round the slip
and thought it fine fun, though if the plank had
turned to one side they would both probably have
been drowned. Presently said Thomas “Sup
pose we try it in the river, it goes so nice." The
tide was setting out, and so carried them along
pretty swiftly. Billy and Tommy kept their
tiny paddles going, and Tommy cried out “£>
Bill, how we do make her go!” But he little
thought where they were going. Sinful
pleasure mav seem very fine for a while, but the
end of it is always sorrow and often death. On
they went at a merry pace. Presently, however,
Billy looked round and saw to his amazement,
that they were passing Governor’s island, and
floating out to sea.
At this they both screamed mournfully;—yet
they had the presence of mind to keep steady on
their dangerous horse. On they went. But
God was better to them than they had been to
their mothers. A schooner happened just then
to be beating up the narrows which led out to
the broad deep sea. The captain happily saw
the sorrowful voyagers ; he sent a boat out,—
picked them up overjoyed and took them in his
vessel to the city.
When the schooner came up to the dock, the
little law-breakers went to the captain and thank
ed him for his goodness. “Very well,” said he,
‘“you’re very welcome, but you are not off
yet.”
Upon this he called to a sailor,—“Tom,bring
me a rope’s end." Tom brought it, and the
captain gave these little boys a pretty severe
flogging They knew- they deserved it. Then
the captain helped them ashore, saying as he let
go their hands, “ Your mothers will thank me
for whipping you, as well as for picking you
up;” ana so I am sure they did.
My son keep thy father’s commandment, and
forsake not the law of thy mother.
There are many men in the world, who make
just such voyages, and receive the same admoni
tions in pretty much the same manner. We
would advise all such to remember there is a
God, who will not suffer his laws to be broken
with impunity.
CONDORS.
Three of these remarkable birds have been
brought to this country by Dr. Roberts, from the
Rio Negro, in Patagonia, which are believed to
be the largest and most splendid ever seen here
alive, measuring from eleven to twelve feet
across the wings. The two males are thought
to be upwards of twenty years of age. The
Chilians say that the Condor breeds once in two
years, and makes no nest, but lays two large
white eggs on the overhanging shelf of a bare
rock. The young ones remain covered with a
black down like a gosling, without the power
of flight for one entire year, roosting with the
parent bird on the same inaccessible cliff The
method of taking these birds pursued by the
Chilians is to place the carcass of a guanaco
within an enclose of sticks, on a level piece of
ground, and when the condors are gorged with
this most attractive food, to gallop up and sur
round them,—when, not having space to run,
they cannot give the body a sufficient momentum
to rise from the ground, are and easily captured.
