moaterimal, anti the clamp on thme hilt bears
time date of 1757. It wsas worn by himt as
Colonel in the coloniali service of Virginia,
and in the war oflIndependencet. As a re
lie, it is the most valuable of time five swords
which Washingomn htequeathed, in the fol
losring claus of his last will andm testament
bearing dlatei. Feb. 9th, 1789:
-To each of my nephews, William
Augustmne WVashin-,-,ont, George Lewis.
Georgo Stepler Wmashington, Bushrod
Washington, andl Samtiuel W asbington,I
give one omf the swords or cutieamux of which
I may die possessed ; antd they are to
choose in the order they are named. These
swords are acconmpanied with an injunc
tion not to tansheath them for the purpose
of shedding blood, except it he for self de
fence, or in defence of their country and
hs rights;: and in the latter cae,.e tkee
them unsheathed and prefer falling with
them in their bands, to the relinquishment
thereof."
Mr. Samuel Washington, having held a
commission in ibe army. in 1794..and the
only nephew who bad participated in mili.
tary service, was allowed the first choice.
and took this-the " service sword."
The history of the cane is eqally well
authenticated. Franklin, in his last will
and testament, bequeathed it to General
Washington, in the following language:
" fi ne crab-tree walking stick, with
a gold head, curiously % rought in the form
of the Cap of Liberty, I give to nly friend,
and the friend of mankind, Gen. Wasbing
son. If it were a sceptre. ho has merited
it, and would become it."
General Washington, in his will, devis
es this cane as follows:
"Item. Td my brother Charles Wash
ingiun. I give and bequeath, she gold head
ed cane left me by Dr. Franklin, in his
will."

The bill to prevent the employment rf
privatei expresses on Mail routes was fur
lier discussed and Fused to a third read
ing. This bill prohibits the transportation
of letters, newspapers, packets, and all
printed or written matter, out of the mail.
It excepts only packets of money, unac
companied by letter. It was urged in fa
vor of the bill, that mail matter to ihe
a3pount of a million of dollars a year, was
now transmitted by rail road and steam
boat exprsses, and that, if the department
was to be expected to answer the ends for
which it was established, it must have all
the revenue to which it is properly cati
tled.
WAsnhyoTo.s, Feb. 8.
Mr. M'Duffie has followed up his views.
on the present fiscal and commercial em
harrassnents of the country, by some very
important declaratoty resolutions, which
he will, no doubt, take occasion to advo
cate before the Senate.
The first resolution declares it to be sbh.
solemn and urgent duty of the preuearo" s.
gress. to adopt without delsq, e.
sures to revive the a
commerce, repl
chequer, a aQ
tion of the exiiig Tarif to a revenue
measure; and the third resolution contem
plates the establishment ofa rigid system
of retrenchment, economy and accounta
bility.
A iensure for reptenishing the Treasu
ry is urgently necessary. It is astonishing
what apathy exists bit this subject. The
adinistitration ix silent, and the Commit
tee of Ways and Means will only move its
the direction of approbation. Mr. Filmore
stated to day. after braving attacks from
Mr. Wise. on the subject of his inursio:n
and wiant of informatiou relative to the
%ubject of sulplies, that he had called for
the necessary information from the Secre
tary of the Treasury,who had proposed the
passage ofa law unthorizing the re-issue of
Treasury notes. The proposal is not fa
vorable for the accomplishment of any of
she ohjects proposed by Mr. McDufie, at
the present session.
Little was done in the Senate, to-day,
except to receive the sword of Washingiou
and the btaf of Franklin, presented to
Codmres by Mr. S. T. Washington. Mr.
Arener made some appropriate remarks
on the sulijeci of these relics. and the Sen
mre in further testimony of their respect
for she associtions connected with the cer
emony, then adjottrued.
Isu the House, the Navy .ippropriation
hill was finally passed. The motion to
rednee the pay uf she officer, was rejected.
Tlhe only imnpdrrant amendment wale was
the redaiction of the amount appropriated
for the item of pay. The bill apipropriases
nearly a milliun and a half~ less than the
essimrateg.
Mr. Holmes took occasion to remark
that he would vote for no more appropria
sions, until they should know what were
to be the revenues and expeuditures. He
stated that he should submsit a resolution
for the appointmetn: of a Committee to re
pant an she best mode of improving the (i.
nances and reducing the expenses of the
Goversnment so the amount of income.
Trhe House ordered twenty thousand
extra copies of she Journsal of yesterday,
wish the remarks of Mr. Summers and
Mr. Adams on ste presentation of the
WVasbington relic., to be printed for the
use oftlie members.
