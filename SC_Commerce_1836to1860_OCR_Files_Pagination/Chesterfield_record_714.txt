The Tuscaloosa " Monitor" tc-iis us that a Mr. ;
Tiioui is Marshall, of that city, hu? in his posses- ;
sion a stone idol, or image, which was found at a
distance of twelve miles from Tuscaloosa, near the
river, evidently the relic of some race, superior to
the Iadi in. It is the representation, according to
this paper, of a human being ; about ten inches in
length, of very good proportions, and all the fcaturcsof
the head and face distinctly chiselled. The :
top of the head is flat, and has on one side four or '
five cuts or gashes. This image was first exposed
to view on the overthrow of a tree, by the roots,
when it was laid bare in the uptorn earth. Near
the spot, a more curious discovery was made, in a
complete set of elegant weights, oi a fine black
polished stone, from an ounce to a pound, corres?v\n/linnr
von- nearly with the standard of weights 1

now in use. If these arc genuine antiques, tiicy
may suggest, by these very standards, some clue .
o the people by which they were employed.? j
They render it conclusive of en antiquity very dif.
ferent from that of our immediate Indian predecessors,?though,
perhaps, we need no additional
proofs to this effect, beyondthose which we already
possess. The editor of the Monitor further states
that the same gentleman, Mr. Maxwell, gathered
from several mounds?which arc from fifty to
eighty feet high, sixteen miles from Tuscaloosa,
and near the town of Carthage?a number of
hatchets, and vessels of stone,?spears, &c. Wc
should be better pleased to have a minute description
of these remains, which prove the use of iron
and the knowledge of its artisticu! us:, among the
unknown people in question. The accumulation
of little atoms of information of this sort, may lead

iahed people ; and, taken in connection with the
imperfect records of the Northmen, may afford us
lights of a kind, to conduct our footsteps with equal
satisfaction and certainty, to the most important
treasures of American antiquity.
The mounds spoken of above, arc all connected
with lines of fortification. We have long been oi
the opinion, that these mounds were less employed
for the purposes of burial than defence ; and were,
no doubt, intended as places of final struggle?citadels
of superior strength and elevation?where
the few, contending with the many, might be pc~
sfcssed of the important advantage attending superior
height of position for the use of 6toncs and
missiles, and for grappling, toot to foot, with theupward-struggling
assailant.
JUDICIAL DECISION.
A singular judicial decision we s recently given
in Lycoming County Court, Pa., by the Hon. Ellis
Lewie. A young lady, seventeen years of age,
daughter of Dr. Win Armstrong, applied for baptism
to the Rev. Win. S. Hall, a Baptist clergyman.
Her attendance at the appointed time was
prevented by her father's interference, who threatened
to kill Mr. Hall should he baptize his daughter.
Subsequently the daughter was baptized,
and the next day Dr. Armstrong pursued Mr. Ilall
w.th a eatie, and compelled him to take refuge in
a house. Mr. Hail applied for an order from Court
to have him bound over to keep the peace. In the
way of granting this order there was of course no
difficulty, as the defendant had no right to take
the law into his own hands, however niuoh he had
reason to complain of the Rev. gentleman's proceedings.
But another question then arose, the
solution of which involved the necessity o" con- <
sidcring the relation above rcfeircd to?namely |
that of parent and child, witli reference to the power
and authority of the former to control the re1'
? ? ir/l wl'fmc Al" fhr> lr.ttrr.
lltn"US ItCIIiijjJ uim ........... v ...v .......
The opinion of the presiding judge, the Hon.
Lliis Lewis, is published at length in the paper .
from which we obtain the facts; and it is ag.tinsi ]
the llev. clergyman. The presiding judge, (lis.
cussed at gr.at length, and with signal ability, tiic
foundation and extent of parental authority to
educate his child, to regulate her conscience, ana
to do all that his conscience proscribes to him as
essential fcr her bodily and spiritual welfare, until
she arrived at the proper age to determine in these '
matters for herself. What that proper agt is it .
would be very difficult, perhaps impossible, to de- '
tcrnhne in the abstract; tiic Cool's of justice, 1
therefore, must be governed by the rule of law,
which prescribes the age of twenty-one as the sea. 1
son of lawful majority, or legal emancipation from
parental control. On the trial of the case, the <
Court decided that Dr. Armstrong should be bound <
over in the suin of $oOU, and that Mr. Hall .
should pay the cost prosecution.

EPITOME OF WAR.
i
The history of every war is very like a scene ,
I once saw in Nithsdule. Two boys, from differ
cut schools, met one fine day upon the ice. They
eyed each other with rather jealous and indignant
looks, and with defiance on each brow. 44 What
are ye glowerin* at, Billy ?" 44 What's that t
- :_a.
you J I'll Iook wnere 1 nave a iihuu , an muut
ine, if ye daw." A hearty blow was the return '
to this; and then such a battle begun! It be.nr
Saturday, all the boys of both schools were ou th?
icc, and the fight instantly became general an
desperate. At one time, they fought with niiss.lc
weapons, such as stones and snow-halls; but a;
length they coped in a rage, and many bloody rap:
were liberally given and received. I went up U
try if I could pacify them; for by this time a
number of little- girls had joined in the affray, am'
I was afraid they would be killed. So, addressing
the one party, I asked what they were pelting the
others for?what they had done to them. 44 O
naething at a', man; we just want to gic them a
good thraehin." Alter fighting till they wen
quite exhausted, one of the principal heroes stepper
forth between, covered with blood, and hisclothc*
torn to tatters, and addressed the belligerent partics,
thus : 44 Wecl, I'll tell you what we'll do wi
ye; if yell let us alane, we'll let you alane."?
There was no more of it?the war was at an end,
and the boys scattered away to their play. I though:
at the time, and have often thought since, thai
that trivial affray was the best epitome of wur in
general, that I had ever seen. Kings and m'nis.
tersof State are just a set of grown up child:en,
exactly like the children J speak oi; wan eniy
this material difference?that instead of fighting
out tlic needless quarrels they have raised, they
sit in safety and look on, hound out their innocent
but servile subjects to battle; and then, after a
waste of Llood and treasure, are glad to make the
boy's conditions: 44 If ye'll let us ulane, we'll let
you ulanc."?Lay Sermons, by the Ettrick Shepherd.

PITTSBURGH GLASS FACTORY.
Glass of all descriptions is manufactured in this
citv, an ! this fragile production of her factories
may he found, we arc told, in the elegant mansions
of New Vork, Philadelphia and Baltimore, as well
as in the log cabin of the \N estern emigrant. 1 iie
cut glass made here is of excellent quality?wbi'e
and very clear. The cutting of glass consists en.
tirely of grinding away successive portions, by
holding the glass upon the surface of small wheels,
made of stone, metal and wood, which arc made
to revolve rapidly, by means of a steam engine.?
The first or rough cutting is given by wheels of
stouc, afterwards wheels of iron are used, having
their edges covered with sharp sa?id,??> with emery
of different states of fineness. The last polish
is given with brush wheels, covered with oxide of
tin or lead. To prevent friction from exciting so
much heat as to endanger the glass, a small stream
of water continually drops upon the surface of the
wheels. One of the principal glass manufacturers
mentioned an amusing incident. Some Indians
had been as a delegation to Washington, about
some reserved lands, and they spent a few days
here en their return. One of them, a chief, had
seen all that was curious in Baltimore and Phila.
dclphia, without being much excited. While here,
he visited the glass-house, and watched all the various
operaliot s with great interest. At length he
saw the process of making some cream jugs. The
body of the jug was formed first; when the material
for the handle was formed and fixed, it was
9 n/^rfVw vessel. Seein<? all this pro

luct'd from molten glass, the chief could restrain
nimself 110 longer. He rushed forward to the work nan,
took him by the hand, and declared that he
nust have the spirit of the Great Father within
lim, or he could not have performed such a wonJc.\?Corr.

anecdote.
A good story is going the rounds of the newspapers,
about a man in New York, who had a
singular passion for buying quantities of second. J
hand turniturc, and any other articles, at auction, ;
that were sold cheap, whether he had actual use
for them or not, and therefore dear at any price. :
Having filled his houtc with useless and antiquated
articles, his wife, a prudent, careful woman, \
annoyed at his extravagance, very quietly, and ,
without consulting him, 44 took the responsibility"
of sending a quantity of the useless truck to an
auction room to be sold. Great was her dismay ,
and astonishment, when, on the evening of a sale,
a large majority of the things came back to the !
house. Her husband had unfortunately stumbled j
into the auction rtom, and not recognizing his '
own furniture, had repurchased it at a better bar- !
gain than at first I

The United States Senate.?The New York
Journal of Commerce speculates as follows upon
iic composition of the next Senate :
"The Senate now comprises 3J Whigs, if we
ticludc .Mr. KiveS of Virginia, and 20 Locos.? ;
There are two vacancies in Tennessee. It is safe .
o assume that in place of Mr. Preston, of South '
Carolina, Mr. Graham, of North Carolina, and .Mr. ,
Kerr, of M irylinu, democratic Senators, will be |
:hoscn for six years from tiie 4th of March next. J
Indiana is doubtful, but the chance is that there !
ilso a Loco will be elected. On the other hand the j
Whigs have a chance of gaining a St nutor in Ohio ,
n place of Mr. Alien. The Whigs will retain a 1
najoritv in the Senate unless Tennessee should go !
lack to Locofocoism, and may have a majority
:vcn if she should."

Longevity.?A most remarkable case of longe- '
city, in cold, rigid New England, is that of John
[hLlcy, of August, Maine, who died a few years
since, at the venerable age of 124. lie married
it the age of eighty a girl of eighteen, by whom
ic had ten children?the youngest of whom at his
icath was more than one hundred years younger
:han his father. lie was of Irish origin, but a native
xirn citizen of Maine. His hair was a pure silvi r!
.
white, a small lock of which was exhibited to U3,
i day or two since, by gcnMeman of this city, I
who had it from his physician. A short time be- <
ore his death it turned black. His teeth were
xrfcct and sound to within a 6hort time of his
loath. So remarkable a man was he in his day, j
hat lie was a subject of curiosity to all who visited
that section of the country where he resided.
The late Dr. Harris was of that number. The late
Gov. Gore of this Common wealth, while on a tour
o Maine, paid him a visit, and gave him a dollar
or every year of his life.?Boston Transcript.

44 Pigs arc happy people. We may talk disparagingly
about living like a pig. To live like a
pig is to live like a gentleman. Although it is not
permitted by the order of nature that a pig should
laugh, or even smile, he enjoys the next best blessing
of humanity, the disposition to grow fat. How
