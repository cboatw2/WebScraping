Agricultural.
The question of the reduction of the cot
ton crop has undergone considerable dis
cussion in the newspapers recently. We
have published some articles from other
papers on this subject. The following ju
dicious remarks we copy from the Au
gusta Constitutionalist.
With regard to the first question,-the
reduction of the production of cotton,
we have to observe that we would like to
see the quantity produced, somewhat re
duced, but not ton the plan proposed in the
newspapers that have recommended such
a measure. Reduction is proposed as a
first and principal measure. We believe
that reduction should be effected only as
an incident to a change in the course hit bi
erto pursued by the cotton planters. Our
view of the suhject is this: Every planter
should turn his attention to an indepen
dence in all his wants, except in the pro
ductions of tropical climates. He should
be indepeneent for all his bacon, horses,
mules, cattle, and every article in that line.
He should be independeut for the clothing
of his negroes. He should beindependent
of blacksmiths, tailors. and other crafts.
men. He should be independent for his
cotton bagging, rope. and all things neces
sary to carry his crop to market. But in
rendering himself independent for all those
thingsjust enumerated, will he not be oblig
ed to reduce the cultivation of cotton ?
Certainly he will. Then this is the kind
of reduction we should like to see effected
in Georgia. Any other plan of reduction
would not be of any benefit to the planter,
under the present condition of the southern
states, and of the cotton trade throughout
the world ; this is at all events our view of
the subject. Besides it is ourfirm convic
tion that no other plan of reduction can be
carried into elfect. It is idle to speak of
Planters Couventions: Conventions of this
kind' have never been able to effect any
thing: experience demonstrates the fact,
that commercial conventions, free tiade
conventions, and platiters conventions.
have all been inel'ectual in accomplishing
any thing. Evin the other (lay there was
to have been a large convention of plan
ter at Milledgeville: it was a complete
failure. All conventions of the kind will
be tailares also. We could assign innu
meraeeabsToa ~ i~u.- ?C
sides, could any resolution adopted by any
convention be hinding on all the planters?
And, besides. could a conventior recon
mend or designate a better article for cul
tivation than cotton ? Could a conven
tion convince every cotton planter that
the cultivation (if any other product than
cotton would be more beneficial, while that
planter is dependent for all he wears, eats,
and clothes himself with, (on other parts of
the union? It is idle to expect that a cot
vention could accomplish all what would
be itended by and expected from its pro
ceedings.
If, as we have said, every cotton plan
ter should strive to render himself inde
pendent of other states for the supply cif
those articles we have enumerated above,
it will follow, of necessity, that this cotton
planter will have to reduce the cultivation
of tton ; and if in Georgia, South Caro
lia, Alabatia, Mississippi, and Louisiana,
this plan is pursued, we have nut a single
doubt that the quantity of cotton now an
ually produced, will he so reduced, as tc
leave behind to a considerable extent, the
supply for consumption in Europe and in
this country. % e are told that the black
population of Virginia, Maryland, and
North Carolitn is decreasing; on account
of the large tumber of Ieroes transported
to the cotton growing states. In some
measure this is true ; but we must bear in
mind that the transportationt of negroes to
the west-bas for some tmonths past greatly
dimimshed, and that the great cotton state
of alississippi will not admit any more
slaves fromt other states. In the constitu
tion of that state, it ia provided, Section 2,
At tiele Slaves, that " the introduction of
slaves into this -State as merchandize, or
for sale, shall be perohibited from and after
the first day of Mlay. 1834; Provided, tthat
the actual'settler or settlere shall not be
'roibited from purchasing slaves in any
satmthis urnion, and bringing them into
theitae for their owtt indtvidual use, un
til the year 1845." So that there is one
state, and that, one of the largest cotton
states, itt which no increase of slave labor
can take place, except in a natural way.
If then the cotton planters wvere to pursue
an independent course, as already buggest
ed, the production of cotton will not be
much in advance of the consumption,
which is gradually increasing as the popu
lation of every quarter of the globe is in
creasing in a greater ratio than it has done
beore the year 1815. up to which timee the
wars whlich have ahtnost constantly afflicted
mankind, had a check by the general peace
that has ever since been mamntaitned, ex
cept in the southern portion of this conti
neat- And if the inctease of the produc
tion of cotton still goes on, not withstanding
the todependent course that the planters
may pursue, it will not be in a greater
ratio than the increase of consumption, el
fected by a tnatural increase of population
in the fotur quarters of the globe.
To show that there should not be much
alartm at an extraordinary difference be
tween production and consumption, or
supply and demand, we would call atten
tion to the following statement.
The stock of cotton of all sorts in Great
Britain on the 1st of January, 1845, was
903,10y bales, and in Ilavre 46.625, mak
tg in round nttmbers 950,000 b'alcs. Let
us add 150,000 bales as stock in otner
ports of the Continent of Europe, and.we
have a total stock of 1,100.000 bales. The
supply for this year we estimate at 600,
000 from other countries than the L. ited
States. The supply from this country we
estimate at 1,400,000 bales, making a to
tal of 2,000.000 bales, which added to the
stock, will make the supply 3,100,000
hales. Now what will be the consump
tion ? Great Brilnin will require 1,500,
000 bales, onel the Continent of Europe
at least 600.000. which will give an
amount of 2,100,000 as the demand of
Europe, and which, deducted from the es
timated supply, vill leave a stock of 1,000,
000 on the 1st of January, 1846, precisely
the amount of stock remaining in Great
Britain and Havre, by 50,000' bales less,
on the 1st of January, 1845. We make
these estimates on the imports, consump
tion, andl exports, of last year's cotton
movements in Europe. Now, if there is
the least increase in the consumption of
this year, the estimated stock remaining
on the 1st of Jautiary, 1816, will be less in
proportion to the increase of consumption.
But it is contended that the present crop
of the United States will be larger than
last years. It will be larger. But how
much, it is not so easy at this time to make
an estimate. Prom all the information
we have been able to obtain from various
quarters. we have come to the conclusion
that the crop of this year will not be as
large as that of 1843, which was nearly
2,400,000 bales. But if even the present
crop amorunted to as much; if even it
went up as high as 2,500,000, would this
he sufficient to create the alarm which has
taken hold of so many of our citizens?
Were not saving prices obtained in 1848,
when the crop amoutnted to 2,400,000
hales? And why should not present prices
he maintained with a crop of 2,500.000,
especially when we must all be satisfied,
that since 1843 an increase of consumption
has taken place, and is still growing, not
only in Europe but in this country.
WORN-OUT LANDS.
In the American Farmer of Dec. 27th,
appeared at) extract from a communica
tion by John Jones, of Wheatland. to the
Farmers' Cabinet, in which he makes al
lusion to the astonishing effects brought
about in the renova'ion of worn-out !ands
in Delaware, by Dr. Noble. of Philadel
pa.-On -111ndIrtVF -coot btit hfiftee
lasper acre,.n 'dcdhl1 U
els of wheat i hree years ago, by the ap
lilication of eight loads of manure, costing
freight included, less than one dollar and
li frty reis per load, the Doctor raised forty
seven bushels of wheat from one acre, and
from the remainder rather less, the ave
rage beitig an enormous increase over the
produce of former years.
The editor of the American Farmer ex
presses an 'increase desire' to learn the
secret bY which the Doctor has been ena
bled, at the small expense of less than $12
per acre, to effect such astonishing results.
We w ould inform him there is no secret
whatever in the method pursued, but such
as-any farmer might discover for himself,
if he would but take the trouble to read
some of the numerous works upon the ap
plication of chemistry to agriculture, lately
published. Knowing by chemical anily
sis or examination, the composition of the
grain nnd straw of wheat, and that of the
soil, it was an easy matter to apply those
miaterials w,. -, were ticeded, in order to
produce a healthy and vigorous growth.
He prescribed fro his wheat and soil as ie
would for a patent, and with equal iuc
cess; health and strength have been rea
tored to the tuffering subject. -
Now, as to [he sources of manu-e which
he has made use of, we will say a word :
it is in the power of ev'ery farmer, near
large cities,the ma terials which are needed
to enrich the soil.
The Doctor formed a compost obtained
from various sources, consisting of the
refuse of tanniers soap boiling establish
men ts, &c.; in short of such animal and
vegetable substances as contain soluble
salts. or which can be made sttbservient
to the growth of plants. In the selection
of these substances hre was guided by their
composition as mad~e known by chemical
'analysis.' 'Give,' says a rational agri
culturist, *to one plant such substances as
are necessary for its developement, but
spare those which are riot requisite, for the
production of od/ier plants which require
them.'
'Ani empirical,' or quack system 'of ag
ricul ure. has ad ministered the same kind
of :'nanutes to all plants, or where a selec
tion has been made, it has not been based
rpon a knowledge of their true composi
tion.' The phosphate of soda or lime, the
silicate of potash, and sulphate of ammo
nia. or other salts containing these in other
c'onditions, are necessary to the production
of wheat; these have been supplied by the
Doctor, and why should we be assotrished
at the results which have followed their
applicatiotn? He has adopted the scienl
tific method of manuring, and if his knowl
edge of the composition of the soil and
wants of tihe crop was exact, and his con
clusions correctly drawn, he could not err
in the application of his manures. Here is
indeed a triumphr of science over the old
fashioned, uncertain, and empirical- mode
of farming; here is an example worthy the
attentIon of every farmer, apd especially
should it be considered by those whom
prejudice has -so blinded that they cannot
perceive the vast benef~ts arising from the
judicious application of scientific knowl
edge to agriculture. It is indeed 'credi
table to the Doctor as a scientific farmer ;'
we ail him as a benefactor, and desire
that he may persevere in that path or use
fulness in which he has found both pleasure
and proit.-Cor. Fanmers' Cabinet.
iumnp T.fter.-What is the best kind of
madhine for taking out stumps? Many
contrivances have been got up for the pur
pose of clearing fields of stumps. Orne of
the most common in this section is the
wheel and axis, mounted on high posts so
as tolift thestumps up. The Albany Cul
tivator has a cut of one which lie says costs
three or four hundred dollars. and which
has cost the inventor, first and last, $10,000
to bring to perfection. This appears to be
an excellent machine, but although it
requires bdt a single horse to pull up a
stu mp of the largest rate, yet it costs too
much for these "diggings."
We have seen the following very simple
plan of stutlp clearing, adopted with good
success.
Take a stroag stiff hard wood stick of
timber; say fifteen or twenty feet long and
six inches in diameter. Cut round the
stump and take ofsomeofthe roots. Then
place the timber upright againit the stump
and chain them together strong. Fron tthe
upper end which is now in the air, let the
chains pass to the axeltree of a pair of cart
wheels, to the tongue of which a pair of
strong oxen are attached. When all is
ready, start the oxen along, and the stump
"keels over " as easy as you capsize a cab
bage in a garden.-Me. Fa,

THE PLUNDER PRINCIPLE.
There are antagonizing principles and
forces throughout the .vhole moral as well
as material world. Falsehood is opposed
to truth-wrong to justice-violence and
outrage to peace and order. And in a
state of society, there always a few, whose
objects and interests are ever opposed to
that of the many. The whole history of
our race shows that there is always a por
tion of society-and that invariably the
smallest portion--who seek, for ambitious
aggrandizement or sordid gratification, to
,ppropriate to themselves the results of
labor, and to wield, for like put poses, that
power which legitimately resides in the
body of the p
plhaid h dfl~liped sin our happy po
litical system, and is opposed now, as it
ever has been, by the selfishness and the
stnister objects of the few.
The freedom of the human will, and the
right to its unfettered exercise, were the
object and result of our Revolution. That
divine princ;ple. worked out by the exer
tions and sealed by the blood of its mar
tyrs, was applied in all its energy, by our
forefathers, in setting tip our political sys
tents. Here, in the United States, of all
the countries which the sun in his circuit
looks upon, can man be said to be free in
the enjoyment of his social, political, and
religious rights. And yet here, even here,.
we see the proof and the illustration, that
power is always stealing front the many to
the few. We cannot always trace the
manner, nor the means, by which it is ef
fected ; but still, like the in.isible and un
ceasing law of gravitation, the vicious i
principle is always drawing from.the cir
cumference t the centre.
Wealth chims for itself peculiar privi- I
leges, and enbrces its demands by the in
fluence of itE corrupting nature. It is a
dilfcult thins to find a man of wealth,
who does nu think that his influence in
the social anc political system ought to be
in proportionto his richee. And he con
tinally uses his wealth to increase his
wealth, and ut advance his itierests in the
State. The ichi, from a cotmmorn institnct
and a comma' obiject, invariahuy unite in
a common le;;jue agaitist the most numter
ous, but poourE class of socemy. The aris
tocratic itn feeinig, the proud atnd the dom
inering, are dlways attracted to the rich,4
and, togethe, they ake up) that class
which ever las been, and ever will be,
opposcd to th rights of te many. Their
whole polind purtpose is to live with
out labor-byartificial means ; whilst the
many live acording to the command of
their Mlaker-by the sweat of their brow.
The few, herecharacterized and defined,
not ottly consatute a class, but a party.
It is imimateril, howvever, what party de
signation the: may for the time take, they
seek to live sid attain their purposes by
policy anmd pwtder. Hence they are the
advocates of tanks, corporatiotns wvith ex
clusive privilges, pmtective tariff's, and I
innumerablo ither schemtes, which reauh I
in the plunde of the many for the benefit(
of the few.
The utnjtustid pernicious influences of
these prinaciles in their practical opera- j
tions, upon elsses, interests, and sections, .
it shall be oubusiness to show hereafter.
It is our puPOSe to purstue this subject
from time toime, when matter more ur

From the Correspondent of N. Y. Jour. of con.
WASHINGTON, February S.
I have this day learned, from an un
questionable source, that at the time of
Santa Anna's fall, a treaty was in pro
gress, aRnd nearly consummated, for the
entire cession ofCalifornia, or New Mexico,
to Great Britain, it only being defeated by
the fall of Santa Anna. It seems tha' pa
pers and documents were lo'tmd on his
person when captured, fully confirmatory
of the fact, information of awhich has reach
ed our government. It thus appears that
while England was thus indirectly oppos
ing the annexation of Texas, she was at
the same time negotiating for the acquisi
tion of a country still more extensive and
valuable. San Francisco is said to be one
of the finest bays and safest harbors on the
coast of the Pacific. With the possession
of this fine harbor, England could conmol
the commerce of the whole (if the Pacific
Ocean, reaching from California to the
possessions of Russia.
It is said that our government have sts
pected some design of this character otn
the part of Great Britain, for some time
past ; but could never get hold of any thing
tangible on the subject until now. This
news will necessarily create surprise and
attract netmivion aniugour people. I send
thi, off in great haste hoping you w ill lose
no time in giving it to your readers.
Fr om the Augusta Constitutionalist.
All the whig leaders in and out of Con
gress have prognosticated a war with Eng
land, on account of the Oregon question,
and the bill lately passed the [louse of
Representatives, for the organization of
that portion of the United States intio a
territory. Whether their prediction is likely
to be fulfilled, can be conjectured from the
following message of-the President.
SENITE, FEBRUARY 20.

read. and,
On motion by Mr. Archer. ordered to

on Foreign Relations, viz:
To the Stnate of the United States:

pondence n hich may have passed between
this government and that of Great Britaic,
or between either of the two governments
and the minister of the other, in relation to
hat subject since that tine- I have to say,
that in my opinion, as the negotiaiion is
still pending, the information sought for
cannot be communicated without prejudice
o the public service. I deem it, however,
proper to udd. that considerable progress
has been carried on.in a very atnicable
pirit between the two governments; an.]
ha there is reason to hope it may be ter
ninated, and the negotiation brought to a
lose, within a short period.
I have delayed answering the resolution,
mnder the- expectation expressed in my

mave been terminated before the close of

pression, that distilled liquor was the chief
cause of intemperance wereexerting then
selves to induce the public to abandon the

Being satisfied fronohservation and ex.
perience. as well as from medical testimo.
ny that ardent spirits as a driuk is not on
ly needless but hurtful. and that the entire
disuse of it would tend to promote the
health, the virtue anti happiness of the
community, we hereby express our con
viction that should the citizens of the Utni
ted States, and especially the young men,
discontinue entirely the use of it they wottli
not only promote their.owu personal bene

2ccuntulation of manure, from one year's
!nd to another, day it) and day out, and
rrum every possible resource. Not a sin
gle pound of feathers, or of hair-or horn
ar of hoof, not a single pint of ashes, or of
,oap suds, not a weed. it it were possible
:o prevent it. should be lost-all should be
:onverted into manure. Of one thing ev
!ry farmer is certain.-that cultivalion er
Lausts his land; something. of course must
)e done to restore that of which it is ex
austed. How long will a horse work if
ie gets no feed! How long will tlls best
:ow give milk if she gets nothing to eat!
4eiti.er can a farm be worked and n:ilked
vithout being fed.
Instead of looking only to the stable or
he cotypen. or barnyard for manure and
1tanaaimg them carelessly and unskilfully,
he thinking farmer will reflect, that there
s nothing which will rot, but what may be
onverted into good fattening food for his
arm. If a horse dies on the farm, lei him
e covered wilh cart loads of earth, and
ie very gasses that escape in the course of
'utrefaelion, Will impregnate and make
nod manure of the whole mass. Let
othing be lost-not even the offal of tle
ouhry or pigeon house.- Germantown Tel.
For Parents -The ordination of Prov
lence, says a distingui-hed writer, is that
onie should form our character. Thte
rst ubject or parents should tbe to muake
nine interesting. It is a bad sign when
ver children have to wander from the pa
autal roof for amusement, Provide
leasure for them around t heir own fireside
ad amtong themselves. The excellett
,eigh Richmond pursued this plan-had a
museunm in his house, and exerted every
erve to interest his little flock. A love o;f
omne is one of the greateat safeguards iq
me world of mian. Do iou ever see men,
'hQ delight it their own firesidles. lollitng
bout taverns and oyster cellars? implant
us sentiment early in a child, it is a
lighty preservative against vice.
An important Decision.-A great sensa:
on has been created in Philadelphia, says
ie Spirit of the Times, by a recent deqci
on in one of our Courts. It isstated tha;
large extent of property in Philadelphia
alued at from four to six millions of dol
irs, and covering whole squares of dwell
1g., was lately laid claim to by the heirs
f qns James Patrick, all or which pro
erty in the. course of years got into and
ow stands in the bauds of a variely of
wners. The property had been origit
Ily confiscated, ti w as said, and each pro
rieor conceived his title therefore a good
ne. The decision of the court in favoy
fithe heirs of Mr. Patrick is therefore a;
mnishing! It renders hundredjs of title
seds worthless as so much brown paper !
lesers George M. Dadlas, David Paul
rown, and William L.- Hirst, Esquires,
me attorneys for the heirs, are to receive,
is said, one ifllh of the whole value of
me property recovered for their legal ser
ices., Half a million each will rendei
