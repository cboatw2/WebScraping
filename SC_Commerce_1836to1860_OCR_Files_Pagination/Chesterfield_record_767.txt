"That do either," exclaimed the poor
shepherd, as he turned awsy the second time.
?Cruel, cruel Cauth!"
Something whispered to him, Try if perhaps
the TRUTH will do?" Fresh courage
seemed to animate hia derponding mind, and
Wheeling about, he commenced the colloquy,
and coming to the usual interrogation " where's
the ram," he dropped on hie kneea and exclaimed,
"Ob! my lord. 1 had .a falling out
with my sweetheart, and she would not make
it up with me unless I nude her a present ol
your lordships favourite ram. Discharge me
my lord; do with mo.what you pleaae, but I
could not bring myself to tell yuur lordship a
LIE!" .
"ThatwH do!" shouted Darby, springing
from his knees, and walking np and down
with a foeiing of honsat exultation. He bad
scarcely time to compose himself when his
lordship ana the squire appeared. Darby on
I the usual interrogation being put, droppod on
hia knees, and told "the truth and nothing but
tha truth," and instead of seeing a frown
gather on hia lordships countenance, he behold
him turn with a look of triumph towards the
squire while he exclaimed.
"An honest mau's the noblest work of God."
The ladies are informed, in conclusion, that
the squire's forfeited sheep were given to
Cauthleen at a dowor, and in taking the hand
of her shepherd, she promised never again to
put his truth and constancy to so severe a
trial.
WASPS IN A BALL ROOM.
O.i-Tuesday evening the 291h ult. as two
young men who had been taking a wasps' neat,
were returning to Chesterfield, on approaching
the town they were attracted to a house
by the sounds of music and rejoicing. 11 prov
gU iu wv * uwoiiuig wnere leanviliea in celebration
of a marriage was taking place; and,
claiming come acquaintance with tho inmates
the young men joined tho festive throng. The
wa?p?' nest, which was folded in a handkerchief,
was placed in a corner of the room, unknown
to the company, and the dance proceeded,
After a time, the two young men
alluded to, took their departure, leaving
(whether intentionally or not, does not appear)
tho neet in the room. The dance continued,
when lo! one of the females made an equivocal
sort of movement, And a precipitate retreat
from the house, her husband following close
at her heels, anxious to learn the cause of his
wife's extraordinary conduct. Scarcely had
the party left the house, when a second and
a third, and a fourth of the female gttests,
exhibited similar equivoeal symptoms, follow,
ed by suppressed shrieks and bewildered
looks The male members of the company
looked anxiously and enquiringly at tlie ladies,
who in return skipped about the room with
wonderful agility, giving sundry indicationi
that their mysterious movements could not be
satisfactorily explained. Suddenly the men
became afflicted, though not exactly after the
aam? failiinn va fli? '"'I'? ~ ?1 - "
.?..... .. .?v jauiv'i atiu very exciting,
but at tbo aame time very comical scene
ensued, to attempt to depict which would be
a hopeless task : it may bo imagined, but
certainly cannot be described. The cause ol
this derangement of the festive circle was,
howover, soon apparent. The fidler, whe
was sightless, feeling something very sharp
enter his cheek, dropped bis instrument, and
applied his bands with great force to his face,
bringing to tho earth one of the monsters that
had been a source of atmoyanoe. Suffice it
to eay, some of the wasps had escaped from
confinement, and in revenge for the punish*
ment that they bad endured, crept up the legi
of the dancers, and indicted their sting. Ai
many as three and four wasps were found
upon one of the females.?Derbythire Chron.
