PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY.
There is in human nature, a strong pro- (
pensity to throw olf individual responsibili- ,
*y, and exonerate ourselves Iron) those ,
tiell-denying duties, which cost a strug- (
gle to perforin. W o have no fears that ,
maternal influence or obligation, will re- ,
ceive more attention than is due a subject .
-of such vita! importance, one so intimate- j
Jy connected with the best interests of ,
present and future generations; and ulti- "
inately, with the renovation of the corld. t
But there is danger that paternal respon- (
sibility will in a measure be overlooked, j
or at least undervalued. That fathers may .
feel themselves disburdened oftheir obligalions,
by the recent efforts to bring mothers
to a proper estimation of this influence,
and to induce them to come fully up to x
those high and holy duties imposed on t
them by nature and the word of God.
While providence has assigned to the <
"mother, a station nearest the heart of her <
ofFspring; while upon her is conferred the |
honor of stamping the first impressions on -f
~ - t *? I? _ I
the mind ot uitaucy; wnue sue aionc pos- j
sesses that patient, untiring love, which f
imparts line upon line, and precept upon t
precept;?the same providence has consti- t
tuted the father the execut' i head of his f
-household ; and clothed him with power: J
to command, aad authority to enforce j
obedicucc. There is a dignify in his!
name, a might of influence in his charac-.
ter, that should most effectually co-opc- j
rate with the mother in her tender assidui-;
tics; and her difficult and arduous duties
which are essentially requisite to the prop- j
cr moral training of an immortal being for
O O
this world, and the world to come.
It was for the neglect of this paternal re- c
sponsibility, that Kli received those fearful
and appalling denunciations from God, i
. .. i u 1.- .U-- r~
WDlcn "SI10UIU HUIKC uuui UJU cats ui oury j
one that heard it to tingle"?and the only t
reasou assigned by the pen of inspiration j
lor the terrific execution of those fearful j
judgments, was, that "Eli's sons made (
themselves vi/c, and lie restrained them j
not." The whole history conspires to s
prove that it was in Eli's power to have j
restrained his sons from wickedness, and (
prevented those awful results which fol-, (
lowed his neglect. That it was his indispensable
duty to thus restrain them, and .
that God who looketh on the heart, by t
whom uctions are weighed, punished him
4or the sinful neglect of a known duty, and ,
.held the father responsible for ail the tre- *
mendous consequences of his children's ,
sins. The sentence denounced against (
Eli, is of the most direct and personal .
character?Jehovah charges the guilt on ,
him, "wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice, ,
and mine offering which I have command- (
ed,and bonorest thy sons above i?c?? ,
Behold, I will out off thine arm, and thou ,
dao on onpmv in mv habitation? for
CUttJl aww ?**# VMW*?.j mmm ---j ? -
I have told him that I will judge his house .
forever for the iniquity that he knoiceth, be- j
cause his sons made themselves vile, and ; .
he restrained them not." There was, to
be sure, a triple obligation resting on Eli: ^
?As High Priest, he was bound to watch j
over the purity of the institutions & worship ,
of the God of Israel; as magistrate, he was ,
to punish offenders, even though that of- J
fender was his child; as parent, he owed
it to himself, his family, and commnity, ,
to train up his children in the way they
should go:?and by all these sacred and
.endearing relations,he was under the high- !
est possible obligations to restrain his
^ children from those overt acts of wickedness
by which the Lord's people were
made to transgress, so that men abhorred
the offering of the Lord, many were deterred
from public worship, and religious
1 instruction, and consequently from repentance
and eternal life, through his instrumentality.
Eli* by his sinful neglect of
duty to his children spread ruin over the

happiness, respectability, aud usefulness
in this life, and destroyed their souls,?
planted thorns in his own dying pillow,
and embalmed his name in everlasting
disgrace. The glory deported from
Israel, the "Daughter of Philistia triumphed,"
and ho died of terror and grief.
Like many parents, both ancient and
modem, Eli practised upon the persuasive
system of family government; he thought
coercive measures to secure obedience
was severe, and unnecessary; be hoped to
talk them into compliance with his wishes;
he told them their faults?the reports that
reached his cars of their evil dealings; he
expostulated with them, "why do ye so
w ickedly?" he argued at length with thein
on the nature and consequences of their
sins against God; but having neglected
the proper time for parental restraint and
correction, he had lost his influence, lus
sons did not respect him, and would no
hear,?God had already given them up t(
to their own hearts' lusts?it was too late
Their unsubdued tempers, their unrestrained
passions, had gathered strength un
der this wicked indulgence, and like tht
pent waters of an ice-bound river, burs
over all these feeble inefficient barriers
and poured u flood of iniquity over the
land,?the consequences of which couk
not now be stayed?the guilt of which restcd
fearfully on his aged shoulders, and
could not be expiated by offering nor sacrilice,
or averted by bitter repentance 01
fervent prayer. The sword of retributive
justice would now pursue his posterity,
and consume them in the vigor of manhood,
the tlower of their age; the IlighPriestliood
would be wrested from them,

ic family, and Eli's domestic character
held tip to future ages as a beacon to warn
them of the fatal effects of paternal neglect.
And ure there no Elis at the present
Jay, who may, in this dark and fearful
mirror, see their own image reflected? no
minister of the altar, who, front indolence,
jr mistaken fondness, disregard the commands
and authority of Clod, and suffer
heir children to grow up without correction
3r restraint, till, too late, they discover
:hat they have fostered the unholy propensities
and headstrong passions of the cor.
-opt heart, and formed characteristics in
:heir children, which will bring disgrace
mi their memories, and consume their
learts with grief, and their eyes with tears,

And is the sin of not restraining your chil'ren,
less offensive to God now, than in
lie days of Eli ? Arc the effects of un estrained
jiropcnsities less pernicious to
the temporal and eternal interests of the
:hild, or less deleterious in its influence
>n the community ? The word of God,

Analysis of Soils.
fFrom tho Genessue Farmer."
It has been given us the golden rule in
igriculture. "To use such manures as
vill make heavy land lighter, light land
teavier, cold land hotter, and hot land
:older;" or in other words to remedy the
.InA.nt t.-liri 1 iivn r fl,nf m;lV l??
..\15Ulli; II imiv.vi WW
n order to do this we must know what
hat defect is ; we must understand the
laturc of the soil we arc to operate upon,
n order to determine whether this or tiiat
wind of manure is to be applied, or wheth;r
a large or a small quantity is needed to
)riug the proportions of the soil to the
standard of fertility. It is therefore of iinjortance
that the farmer should be uo
juainted with the nature and proportions
if the constituents of soils ; that he should
;no\v what those proportions are in such
is are most fertile ; and also what they
ire in the soil which he has to cultivate,
rhis cannot ho determined with any decree
of accuracy hut by analysis.
Another consideration in favour of analysis
of soils, is, that it will substitute pre:ision
of language for the very indefinite
ind unsatisfactory mode of expression
tvhjch now prevails. Thus for instance,
I.ntu-nnn <1 ontJilll T1 lift II
AW iVJll u vui.UJ ...... ..
:layty loam, often does not depend so
much upon certain proportions of clay
and sand, as upon the quality of the soil
?f the place where the term is issued. Iu
1 sandy region of the country, a soil mighl
be termed clayey, while the same soil in
ii clayey region would be called sandy.
Another instance : a large c rop of some
grain or vegetable is raised ; the success
is principally owing to the nature of the
soil; but unless the proportions of its ingredients
are given precisely, instead oi
describing its qualities by indefinite expressions,
we are ut a loss to know liovs
to imitate those proportions.
The constituents of soils which more
particularly influence their fertility, are
these :
1. Slones and pebbles.?These generally
have little other effect than to keep the
lAA..n on/1 nnrmii! nc (li/iu irA ll>?ll:l)l\
3V4i IUU?3C UI1U |h/i uo iuv.^ ui v
hard and unchanging. Sometimes, how
ever, they, absorb and retain water am
also disintegrate and mix with the fine
parts of the soil.
2- Silicious mat I tr.?This is common
ly in the form of line and coarse sand
Soils where this predominates arc little in
jured by water, having little attraction fo
it, and retaining it fceblv. They nevci
winter kill wheat.
3. Aluminous mailer.?This is the pre
dominant constituent of clay soils. Unli!;<
the preceding.it has a powerful attractioi
for water, and retains it strongly ; henc<
clay will remain long suspended in wate
while sand sinks immediately. Alumin
ous soils sutfer from too inqch wet, am
bake hafd in a dry season.
4. Carbonate of h'we.-r-This exists ii
the form of limestone, chalk, and shells
It is a principal constituent of marl. Soil;
which have a due proportion of this ingrc
dient, are naturally fertile and durable in i
high degree.
5. Animal ty vegetable substances -Thesi
improve the soil by operating in so vera
ways. They give wannth to the soil, fur
liish nutriment directly to the plant, ubsorl
moisture and nutritious substances fion
t the air, and render the soil loose and pre)
scive it in a state of pulverization.
6. Water.?The power soils possess of i
retaining moisture enables them to resist 1
- the effects of drought. In analysis, the :
i quantity of water held by soils after being ]
t exposed to the sun's rays, is that only 1
, which is considered as forming a compo- '
i cent part of them. I
1 The following method of analysing ^
soils, or ascertaining the proportions of 1
I their component parts, is, if carefully con- 1
ducted, sufficiently accurate for all practi- j1
' cal purposes. c
Specimens of the soil should be taken
, about three inches below the surface, and
from the average of the field. A conve
nient quantity to experiment upon, after
> stones are separated, is about 400 grains. (
1. Separate by two sieves all the stones f
and pebbles ; with one, those larger than
a quarter of an inch in diameter, and with (
llw* nthr>r th?i<n Jp??. To pffi'pt this, the
soil must be well dried in the sun and gent- (
1 y bruised in a mortar. Then ascertain t
by weighing, the rate per cent, each bears j
to the original mass and note it down. t
2. The soil after weighing is then placed (
in a crucible and heated ten or fifteen j
minutes to n temperature of about 300 ?
Fahrenheit, constantly stirring it; and if (
a thermometer is not used, the proper degree
of heat may be easily ascertained by t
means of the wooden rod with which it is c
stirred ; while the colour of the wood re- r
mains unchanged it is not too hot, but as c
soon as it begins to become brown, the 1,
process must be stopped. It is then again ! t
weighed, and thc loss is set down as wa- j j
ter. j i
3. It is next returned to the crucible, j e
and exposed to u high red heat, till no ; {
blackness remains in it, repeatedly stirring j
it with an iron rod so as to expose new ! c
surfaces continually to the air. It is again f t
weighed, and the loss denotes the amount > p
of animal and readable mailer. ! I
4. Mix the remainder with three or tour t
times its weight of water, stir it thorough- t
ly for several minutes, until it is intimately jj
diffused, and then suffer it to rest. The
coarse sand will fall to the bottom of the
vessel in about a minute, the finer in two 1 s
or three minutes. The liquid is then j},
poured off into another vessel, the sand ! ^
dried and weighed, and its quantity noted i e
down as silicious soil, j r
5. The decanted liquid is suffered to i ^
stand till it settles and becomes clear; it! i
is then poured otf, and the sediment dried j e
at a red heat, weighed, and set down as
aluminous soil. a
6. Tlio presence of rarbonnte of lime
in soil, (which is generally in small quan- j 0
\ : - 1:1.. 1 u.. i
ill iVJCs?y lb iimci iuiiiuu uy puui h'q o
upon it muriatic acid diluted with water, j f
It* it contains carbonate of lime an cf- < a
fervcsceuce immediately takes place in a , jj
greater or less degree, according to the | n
quantity. To ascertain the proportion of ?
this ingredient, place a new portion of the
soil in a glass vessel, and ascertain its c
weight; aiso determine the weight of about; r
a gill of diluteJ muriatic acid, and place j jj
weights in one side of the scales to balance j.
them both; then pour on the muriatic acid. ; n
In three hours, all the carbonic acid from 1 p
the carbonate of lime will have been driv- i d
en oti', and after blowing it out of the vessel
ascertain the loss of weight. Then
as 22 i.s to 50, so is this loss to the amount |
of carbonate of lime in tiic soil.*
It may be important to be able to detect
sulphate of lime (gypsum) in soils, though
i it is not generally looked upon as a com- t!
, ponent part. The following is Sir II. ii
Davy's method : A given weight of soil g
must be heated rod for half an hour in a j o
, crucible mixed with one-third of powder- t
r charcoal. The mixture must be boiled for L
I u quarter of an hour, in halfa pint of water,' \
( and the liquid passed tlirough a filter, and ' c
^ exposed fur some days to the air in an | c
, open vessel. If any considerable quantity , t
of gypsum exist in the soil, a white prccipi- ; t
, tate will gradually form in the liquid, and N
. the weight of it will indicate the proportion, j j
; The most fertile soils are those which j j
contain a proper proportion of the different I (
- ingredients. The following arc the proper- L
( tions of a rich alluvial soii, given by Sir (
, John Sinclair as the most fertile for (
grasses. Silcw, (including stones and sand) t
parts, alumine 7, carbonate of lime 6, t
[ animal and vegetable matter 9. It also (
contained one part in 200 of gypsum, j
The proportions agree very nearly with
* those given by Professor Eaton of the best i
' river alluvion near Troy, (N. Y.) These (
' were, Silcx, (including stones and pebbles)
' 75, alumine 7, carbonate of lime 3, decomposed
animal and vegetaale matter 11, solu- '
r bio salts 1, water 3, A soil whose consti.
tucnts approach these, cannot be unprodue- |
tivc in any climate.
The minuteness of the division of the
-- - 4
parts of soil greatly influences its qualities. | j
r In the first part of the above soils 185 parts J
r only out of 400 could be separated by a |
very fine sieve. Poor soils often have 300 ! {
parts out of 400, of coarse materials,
- The ultraetion which soils have for wa1
tor, so as to remain suspended in it when ]
3 mixed with it, also influences their qualities J 1
r According to Eaton, when any ?oil, or any ! *
* portion of it, will remain suspended in wa- [1
J tcr over four fours, wheat sown iu it is of- 1
I ten " winter killed." Tlip river allufvion I
1 (above given) settled clear in two hours. '
* A clay alluvion of the following composi- '
* tion did not settle till 36 hours: silicious I
- soil 48, alymnmous 39, carbonate of lime *
? 2, soluble salts 2, animal and vegetable J
matter 5, water 7.

| * Where accuracy id required, or whero the <
proportion ?>f carbonate of lime is large, the limo ,
must bo deducted from the eilex, and the weight
* the carbonic from the animal and vegetable 1
i matter. ^
In determining the standard proportions
for a good soil, it must be remembered,
that as different plants have different systems
of roots, branches and leaves, they
flourish best in different soils; bulbous
rooted plants need a looser and lighter soil
than fibrous rooted ; and plants having only
short fibrous roots, demand a firmer soil
than such as have long, and deep tap roots.
It may also be observed, that a rainy region
of the country needs a light soil, while
i dry one needs a rich retentive soil, in orJer
to prevent too much wet in the one
lase, and drought in the other.
A Silk Growing Country.
[From the Northampton Courier.]
France is considered a silk growing
muntry, yet she does not grow sufficient
or her own manufactures, and it is said,
innually imports raw silk to the amount
if $6,000,000.
England, owing to the humidity of her
dimatc, cannot raise the worms to advan1
j* ?
age, ana lor ner numerous manufactories
s obliged annually to import the raw raa*
erial from other countries to the amount
)f $17,000,000. It is stated that we im>ort
annually of raw silk to the amount of
tbout 10,000,000, and of the rnanufaclur;d
over sixteen millions.
Unless the United States push the culure
of the mulberry and raising the co- j
:oons, beyond any thing now in operation
nuny long years must intervene, before we
an supply the demand of our own marLets.
Inhabiting as we do one of the
>est climates in the world for mauufactur- j
ng silk of the best quality, instead of payng
ten millions of dollars uimnallv to othO
^
ir nations for the raw material, we ought
o export two or three times that amount.
It is said our imports of silk stuffs exced
our export of bread stuffs?why is
his ? Only because we do not duly apireciate
and improve the means we ha"e.
i.ct our intelligent farmers be convinced
hat the silk business is profitable, and
hen we can hope that every exertion will
ie made to extend the cultivation of the
nutberry and raising of cocoons.
It is a matter of regret, that any one
hould view the subject as a wild project
nd say, that although it may he a good
tusiness for a few years, if found lucrative,
very body will engage in it, and glut and
uin the market. We wish the subject could
>e so represented to our fellow-citizens, as
o impress them with the importance of
ixamining the subject, on the broad scale
if greater national importance than an v
gricultural subject ever yet pursued.
But if doubts and fears shall remain, we
inly ask thern to commence the culture
f the mulberry on a limited scale for a I
ewyeais, not to interfere with auy other
grioultural pursuit. Let the experiment
e made upon some of our almost barien
nd useless portions of poor, dry, stony
;ravelly soil.
It may be asked, if the silk business
an be made more profitable than any
rop, why not take the best and richest
md ? A fair question indeed, but such
ind is not best for the Chinese mulberry,
nd it would be desirable to have every
atch of poor, waste, dry land devoted to
orne useful purpose.

lie soil of the upper Districts could not

vas scurely a marketable staple. The
apital was naturally confined to the low
country ; and, consequently, the characer
of funded stock and Bank stock holIcn
was restricted to Chareston and its
'icinity. Such a result could not then
lave been a muttor of surprise or a probeni
difficult to solve. But, since the suc:cssful,
the eminently successful cultivaion
of Cotton, perhaps during 1835-G,
comparatively superior to that of the Western
States, it must, to evrrv reflecting
liind,' have been a matter of profound asonishment,
that not only had no poor
Cracker a share in a Bank; but he was concent
to remain, through his Factors, a mere
1 J _ !>_*?! C
lCpCUUt'lJl UII 111U li(lUA5 ui viiauudiuu*
Perhaps this circumstance is to be ac- I
:ountcd for, in the delusion created In'
:hcBankof the State. Its project and ,
plan were well calculated to produce in
contented and unambitious minds a feeling,
the result of which would uaturallv
jc the growing of cotton to buy negroes,
ind the buying negroes to grow cotton ;
jr, to use a hoiucly but expressive phrase,
4 to carry all our eggs iti one basket."
Such, it is believed, has not been the
case iu Georgia. Perhaps it may be said
he has erred as much on the side of creating
Banks as South Carolina has in so
wholly abstaining from chartering them
in her upper districts; but possibly, however
great may have been the inconveniences
site has sustained, they are more
than counterbalanced by tlm benefits that
young and rising State has derived. This
ippears pretty evident, and in all probability
will soon appear more so, in the
prospect Georgia now and hereafter will
;>njoy, of having the two most important
Kail Roads iu the South laid down through
her territory ; when, without great exertion
on the part of South Carolina, the
whole of its territory East of the Broad,
will, in all probability , in this age of improvement,
be without any work of the
kind.
Until the Bank, cam multo laboret was
erected at Columbia, the monied interests
of the middle and upper country had
no deposit for their spare cash out of the
great city. The cotton buyers at Columbia,
Camden and Cheraw, were dependent
on the Factors, who, as stockholders,
commission men, and sometimes as speculators,
were deriving a truly manifold advantage
from this monopoly. Hence the
Columbia Bank had to sustain one defeat,
before it could obtain legislative sanction.
Hard was the battle it had to tight with the
Bank of the State, aided, in fact, by all
the Banks and . inonied interests of
Charleston?these aided also by the Factors?and,
thus combined, was then formed
as virtual a monopoly, as ever existed
in the days of commercial darkness.
Too great an independence of these
liberal gentry would have been witnessed,
if country Banks, formed out of the capital
and sustained by the confidence of the
community, had been established. W ith
their capital paper, they would have become
ilie means of euabling the country
I <. . i 1
mercuams to uuy couon j auu, ui tut; same
time, of circulating to a large amount and
a very useful and extensive profit, the paper
issued on the faith and credit of their
immediate neighbours and fellow citizens.
To such feelings and motives mnv be
attributed the slow progress which Camden
made in obtainingeven a Branch of the
Stale Bank. Also the difficulties experienced
by Columbia, in procuring a charter,
a difficulty equally experienced by Chcraw
and Camden in similar applications?the
latter liked to have failed altogether, for
her charter was only had in consequence
of the high favor iu which Hamburg was
held by the Executive; and had not this
been the case, the whole of the banking
capital of the country above and just below
the falls, would have been confined
to the State Banks at Camden and Columbia
and the chartered Banks of Columbia
and Cheraw.
Charleston can get charter upon charter
and charter after charter; but, as was
i r*% i i I_.a . ..A -
opcnjy avowed in i^oiumuia lasi wimer,
on the subject of the management of an
Insurance office, the Crackers were, it is
presumed, supposed to be ignorant of the
principles on which a Bank was to be conducted,
and therefore must depend on
their superiors, the lords of the great city ;
& in this way, with the exception of Georgetown,
the whole of the Eastern section of
the Slate was to depend on the Branch at
Camden with a capital of $400,000?and,
that of Charleston extended to an amount
so great, as to ena lethe Mother'Bank to
enlarge its accommodation to the already
well accommodated low country, to the
amount ol $?t'/3U,4U/ o/, ueaucung
$120,200 27 for bills and notes in suit?
the latter, it is presumed, a comparatively
larger sum than is in suit in Georgetown ;
and for which enormous crime, a large,
wealthy and important District has not
only been deprived of a Bank; but, in
the splenetic efforts, to injure indirectly,
if not directly, the Eastern sections of the
State, the monied interests of Charleston,
have actually, with all their "honied" expressions
of attachment to their own beloved
city, thrown the whole Pee Den
country into the hands of New York?for
now, that it has a Bank, Cheraw is hut an
"Outpost" of the "Great Emporium;"
and should Georgetown succeed in improving
her Harbour and erecting a Rail
Road front Cheraw, and continue to receive
the benefits of the navigation of
the Pee Dee, tiiere is no doubt a much
larger portion of cotton will be shipped
to New York, and an infinitely
larger mass of dry goods brought into
Eastern South Carolina, than possibly can
ba at present. The words "710 doubt" are
used under the strongest conviction that
the Harbour can be improved, so as to admit
14 feet?and. if this deoth can be ob
tained, there is perhaps n fair prospect
that still greater can %be produced. But a
draft of only 13 feet will suffice for a
coasting or a West India trade ; and this
depth, those cognizant of the subject,
think, can most assuredly be attained.
\ Such are a few of the ideas which
strike the mind on a consideration of the
leading facts on the subject. A necessary
result is the modus operandi. But, before
we allude to this, we will revert to Doc.

From the N. C. Watchman, June 18.
In point of fertility, industry and resources
generally, the valley of the Yadkin can
vie proudly with any portion of the globe.
In the application of this large amount ol
money, this section cannot lightly be passed
by; but we should make our claims
known. We should ascertain facts?the
amount of produce in a given scope?the
distance and profile of practicable routes?
the convenience, quality &c. of materials.
For this purpose committees should be appointed
to gather the necessary statistics.
Not only that, we should invite the cc-operation
of the people on such route as our meeting
inay determine to espouse, and we i
should, in addition to our ordinary repre- .
sentation, send special delegates from all the
counties on the designated line. This last
named measure will not be necessary until
we know whether the law passes. The
other suggestions ought to be carried out at
any rate. We presume that in the mighty
tide of improvement this country wiU have
! some untertaking for facilitating her travel
to market, whether ihe money comes from
the Treasury or from the pockets of private
entd!$fcjp&. Such information then as may
be gathered from a free discussion and full
examination of the subject cow, will be-of
the utmost service on such future occasion- *. '
We are glad to know that every individual
of the community, to whom the matter hits
| been presented, has warmly adopted the

and ability will enter into the measure
with zeal and energy. To the Farmer especially,
this is a mutter of great importance?it
is proposed more than to double
his estate by the operation of money about
| to be thrown into our laps?all that is ask!
ed is, that he shall show a reasonable degree
of sensibility to the subject. We hope,
therefore, that every man, who has an acre
of land aud a plough, or weeding hoe, will
give us his countenance on this occasion.

As it has now become probable that Congress
will pass the bill to distribute the surplus
revenue among the States, and as our

means of executing important works for the
internal improvement of the country, it be- 4
comes the part ofa prudent forecast to urge
the claims ofour community to a participation
of the benefit that may be expected to
accrue from this source.
A Public Meeting will therefore take
place at Salisbury, on the 4th of July next to '
consult and agree upon the proper mea- : j
sures for connecting Salisbury, by means of
a Rail Rad, with some important market. A
general attendance of the citizens is request* ~
cd. MANY CITIZENS.
Salisbury, June 18,1830.
To light a candle at both ends is a sure-^^H
way to burn it out soon?so, to commence
j a work at two places, each individual directj
ing his efforts towards one centre, is a cer|
tain method of completion, as certain as in
j this case would be its perfect and profitable
condition, a proof of which is to be seen in
the fact, that the Charleston Company, for
"passage money of troops and ordinary
travellers received 82,316 38 in obo day,
exclusive of downward freight and passengers."
Therefore, it is with infinite satisfaction
we sec the people of Rowan at last
aroused to the necessity of acting on this
important subject?especially, if tlse wealthy
influential, and intelligent citizens of Waccamaw
will unite with them in as active u
course of operations, at the mouth as they
propose at the source of the Yadkin. If'
this be the case there is no reason why we
should not eventually see a perfect and profitable
communication between Georgetown'
and Mount Pleasant, at the mouth of thw
Kenhawa, by both Rail Road and Lock and'
uain iia?i^aiiui!?
T!i?re will be little or no difficulty in exth-er
passing up the Buuks of tlie Kenhawa;:
or, in a union with some of the work? whichVirginia
will complete to bring the commerce
of the Valley to the harbours of the
Chesapeake. -Hence, it will be no great
matter of presumption, If, by a co-operationwith
Virginia, we suppose ourselves landed
in the vicinity of Rockford, N. and proceed
from thence to Salisbury; and, thence
passing down by Hendersonton, Blakely,Wadesboro',
Snecdsboro', Chesterfield C.
il. or Cheraw, Darlington aud Kingstree,
arrive safely at Georgetown. At Salisbury
we eventually should cross with the road
from Yorkviile, Charlotte &c.?at Darlington
with that alluded to in Document 1TSV
Sess. 1834-5, page 51, and stated as passj
ing thro' Barnwell, Sumpterville, Darling-ton,
Ilarleesville, S. C., Fayetteville, &c. in
N. C. to Norfolk?so that with a connec
tion of the Yadkin & Tee Dee Kail Koad
with those of Virginia and others that must
Ik; laid down in N. and S. Carolina, there is
little doubt it would be as useful and profitable
a work as any that is to be formed.
If a Sage from Charleston should deride
the idea, because Georgetown is not as capacious
a harbor as that of Charleston, it is
1 only necessary to observe, that, situated as
is the provision market in the west, rendered
cxhorbitanily high from the immense
emigration to that quarter; it will be long:
1 before they have a quantity of provisions tospare?also,
that if they had, such is the su1
pcrior consumption and more prompt and
' lucrative market of the dense population of
the North, it will be always well to take it
! there first.?Again, that the prohibition ro
1 export to the West Indies,will, 'till this imi
pediment is removed, compel all provision,
whether of meat or breadstuffs? to pass to

coasting purposes, a port of 12 feet is nfeuv
i !y, if not quite equal to one of 17; but" what
I is most wanted in this section of country is
I a Road, which, mcndcring through it, will
convey the provisions which con be spared
, and do come from the west, to those who
want it. The scheme of amassing it in a
bulk at Charleston or any where else, is
* perfectly ludjerous; but, to the vistoas of
Charleston there is no cod. Selfishness bis
i there erected its throne; and no possible
i idea seems to be entertained of thekdvan*
