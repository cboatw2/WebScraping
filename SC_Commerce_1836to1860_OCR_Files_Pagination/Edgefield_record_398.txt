THEi- LAST WHIG 8ONii.
Solid arguments and good reasons not being
-quite as plenty in furtherance of the claims of
Harrison. the Whigs have adopted a new idea
in the history of political warfare, and are now
striving with such litngs as they may possess to
sing the North Bend hero into the Presidency.
Every whig print has a new whig song which
may he sung, said or whistled; and in Detroit a
book-ves, a whig s6ng book has beein publish.
ed, filled with most delightful ballads all about
Tipipecanoe. Lest they may run out of stock,
wve propose to help theut a little,so here's the last
Whig song. which though not remarkable for
its poetry, is remarkable for its truth.
Old North Bend was a jolly old soul,
And a jolli old soul was he,
He called forhis pipe, and he called for his bowl
And he called fur his Committee of three!
le called for his mug of apple juice,
The best there was in the larden
And told his committee "make no excuse,
Every day it is growing harder!"
As the General sat by his own fireside,
In the midst of advisers three;
"I am puzzled," said he, "with my num'rous
fri e nds,
Why can they not quiet be?
Some ask me one thing, some ask another,
They bother me most to death:
If I say yes and no to this, that, and 'tother,
'Twill surely take all my breath!
If I nod to the North, Iam gone at the South
I'm glad that the nation's no wider;
I declare I am very much down in the mouth,
So give ns a swig of that cidet!"
The Committee sat-not a Word they said,
But they kept up a terrible thinking;
And they watched the nod ofthe old man'shead.
While the mug of hard cider was drinking!
At length they spoke-"IWe've concluded. sir.
That you answer no more of these letters;
'Tis strange how the people, poor, ignorant
souls,
Will con'tantly pester their betters,
You can hand them all over to us, North Bend.
We'll be general for yon awhile
But we'll give you advice-the advice of a
frieid,
Drink cider-drink hard, or you'll spile!"
The General nodded, as wont to do,
To this lordly Committee ofthree,
And eversince' then the old man is mum,
For a still small voice is he?
Go down to North Bend the Hero you'll find,
As jolly as a coon ean be,
But question him tiot, or he'll send you away
To ask his Committee of Three!
From the New Era.
'IPPECANOE.
Tune-"BILLY BARLOW."
Geod Lord! toy masters. what antics and rigs
Are daily cut up by the poor British Whigs,
Their thtoats are all sore, and their noses are
blue,
With shouting and drinking for Tippecanoe.
They say, in their folly, that Harrison must
Be President next-so they down with their
dust
if you ask them the reason, they straight an
swer you.
By shouting "Hard Cider and "Tippecanoe."
Of the wrongs of the people most loudly they
prate
Of mighty reforms to be wrought in the State.
And answer each lquetion propounded by you.
By shouting "Hard Cider" & "Tippecanoe."
Complain that the timesare oppressive and dull,
That our coffers are empty, that our prisouas are
They will tell you thme cause and the remedy
too,
By shoutling "Hard Cider" & "Tippecanoe."
They will tell tus the nvurkets are empty and bad.
Eighteen pence tmust be paid for a very small
shad.
But to make them more plenty, you have no
thing to do
But to vote for the hero of Tippecanue.
He's a doctor they say, that cart cure every ill,
Our commerce revive, our treasury fill,
Collect every grievace the uni verse through,
And bury themi all at Tippecanoe.
Then huzza for the hero that lives at Noth
Bead!
Whose power such manifold blessings can
send,
His election achieved wve'll have nothing to do
But live in a log cabin like Tippecanoe.
Hard *cider we'll drink as we sit by the fire,
And list to the tales ofsunme reverend sire
When he telLs us how the people on cidler got
blue
When Harrison conyuered (?) at Tippecanoe.
DAYs OF OI.D.-Forty years ago. Literatture
meant learning, and wvas snplported by omn
mnotn sense. Refined tnonsense had no adlvo
cates, and was pretty generally kicked out of
doors.
Forty years ago, there were but few mer
chants in the country, few insolvent debtors,
anid they rarely imprisoned for deb~t.
Forty years ago. yonn.. ladies of the first re
spectability learnedl mutsic, but it was the hum
ming of the spimning wvheel, and learned the
necessary steps of dancing in followina it.
Their forte pian" was a loim, their parasol a
broom, and their novels the BiblP.
Forty years neo, the yong gentlemen hoed
corun, chopped wvood at thle door, and went to
school in the wiinter to learn reading. and wri
ting, and arithmetic.
Forty years ago, there was no such thinig as
balls in the summer, and but few itn the witer,
except snowv balls.
Forty years ago, if nm mehianic proposed to
do your work. you might depend on his word ;
it would be done.
Forty years ago. whens a mechanic finished
his work, he was paid for it.
Forty years ago, printers werc p~aid and
therefore enabled to pay their debts. What a
falling ofi.-[ Old Paper.
A Prodigy.-An Irishman. recoin
mending an elegant milk cow, said thai
she would give milk year afier year with
out hqving calves; because it ran in the
breed, as she came of' a'cow that never had
a calf'!
Wearing a Wife -A poor man, of
Greennck, Scotland, lately applied to a
maaistrate 1o have two of his children adl
mitted on the poor's roll. "dow many
have you?7" said the hailie. "Five and
twventy." "All by one wife ?" "Oh no,
sir. I am wearin6 the fourth."
1qUASe.-It you would raise squash
s for winter use, mark out on the surface
if the land six or eight spots for hills, eight
eet apart each way. Then take a spade
irshovel and dig out a circle, say three
eet in diameter, throwing the earth nut
ix inches deep. Into each hole empty a
Nbeelharow load of old rotten manure,
nixed with ashes, and if there is a little in,
;o minch the better. On to this draw the
oose earth back which you throwed out
>f the hole. Now take your spade and
mix and dig the soil and earth well togeth
.r, taking care to pulverize the whole mats
aithrtlly. Level the top off and sprinkle
half an inch of rich loom over the top.
Drop a dozen seeds on the hill, and press
hen an inch beneath the surface with :he
Rnger. With a hoe smooth and press the
op down. 1f youhave a box fitted to re
meive two or foir pattes of glass put this
no the hill; or rather, if you have sneh a
hing. place it on the hill before you plant
the seeds, and drop them within the frame.
Ultimately leave not more than two plnnt
in the hill to stand. You will find that
these will, in due time, run out and cover
the land all over, and produce yoti more,
lar-er and better fruit, than if you had the
hills nearer togeter, or allowed a greater
nmber of plants to stand in the hill. It
is well, however, to platit enonulb in the
irst instance, as a contribution to woros
and bugs. If you save two healthy plnnis
ut of the dozen that come up, you will
Jo well, and these will be enough. The
roots of squashes, under ground, will ex
end as far and oceupy as much spaee,
where the soil is free and loose, as the vines
will cover above ground.
Hollow Horn.-Within a few days we
have heard several farmers from the sur
rounding country complain that "theirrat
Oe have the hollow hor." We have had
a little experience in the management of
:attle, and know sormething tbom this
"hollow horn," and we are satisfied that it
is nothing more nor less than an attendant,
a sort of hancer on, of that worst of all dis
ases attong cattle, the hollow belly. We
know men, who have cattle that during
the whole winter have been exposed to
the "pitiless peltings of the storms,." with
a snow draft or nit ice cake for a hed. with
nothing but a scanty pittance of prairie
hay, or musty straw for food, and who
now wonder that lteir cattle have the hol
low horn. The wonder should he that
1hey have an'y cattle living.
We will make the following proposals
to all those owning carrie. Keep them
under shelter during the storms and cold
weather of the winter. A hovel built of
logs and covered with coarse hay or straw,
standing in a dry place, is sutlicient for
this. Salt them twice a week regularly;
-ive them a sytificiency of wholesome pro
vender, and water at all times, and each of
tlemt a mess of potatoes or turnips, at
least two or three times a week. Keep
yolur working cattle shod. and if you work
hem hard feed and nurse thet' according
ly. Do not beat them; nevfa let thetm
mand in the cold longer than is absolutely
recessary; particularlv when you drive
then to town with a loarl of grnin or wood,
Dr for any other purpose, do not let them
,tand in the streets, hungry and shivering.
hour after hour, while you are in a 2rocery
rrinking and carousing. Follow these di
rections fairly, according to their irue intent
and meaning, and itt the spring we will
engage to pay you ftr all the damages you
have sustained by the hollow horn.
110-losrs.-The New York Spirit of the
Tintes holds the following language, with
reference to good and bnd Horses, and the
way to use a decent animal decently:
The use of thtirouagh andI half bred htor

NEW VOLUME.
To be Published Weekly !
PROSPECTUS OF THE
AUGUSTA MIfRROR.
A W5eekly Literaryl Journal.
Br W. T. Tnornpsox.
Condtemplating a material improVement of
he Mirror. on the commenetnent of the en
uing volume, we have already commenced
naking the necessary arra: gemuents for that
mrpose, and as we look with confidence to our
'riends and 'patron1l for encotragement, we
ma e determinied to give them this early notice
,f-our design.
Tlhangh a semi-monthly issue was deemed
o be the most expedient in the commence.
nent of the publibaiion of the Mirror,
vhen the ground which it occupied, -being ex
lusively devoted to literature, wasyet untried,
id when our domestic resources were yet un
cnown-we feel that the time has now arrived
when a weekly publication is demanded. En;
ertaie.ing this conviction. we have resolved t6
ssue the ensuing volume weekly, and to make
mich improvetnenats in the appearance and plan
y' the work. as will render it still more worthj
he liberal patronage of the southern public.
Firmly believing that the only means regqiz
ite to placeour domestic literature upon an
.quality with that of any other section of th*
tion, is the estallisiment of a literary nedi:
ti at homne. of suflicient standing and charac.
:er to divert it into its proper chatiel-we aid
eso ed to render the 11 irror equal in appearl
mnce with aiv of the Northern journals of the
tame kink, and if the friends of southern liter
ture will unite in giving it the reputation
,vhich southern genius and southern taletie
tre so etninently capable of imparting to its pa:
res. we donbt not that we .hall be able to rets
ier the work much more acceptable to the south
:nt puiblic.
Witha view or-ecomplishing this design we
hall secure the assistance of an able adjaunct in
he editorial department and shall spare neith
:r pains nor expense to give character and in
erest to the work.
No material change will be made in the plan
>r arrangementof the Mirror, which will still
>e devoted to general iiteramre, except the in,
roduction of a critical department for the re
iew of new works. which will be in the hands
>fa gotitleman of approved taste an~d mature
tidgemeunt. The N irror will he printed on su
eo-rio.r paper with handsome new type. and will
>e exected wir b thestrictess regrad to neatness
md taste in its tyio;..raplhy. Each number will
e enveloped sit a neatly printed cover, entitled
Augusta Mirror News Shert," comprising four
iosely printed pages. in which will be given
he. 2ws OF THE wEEK, foreign and domestic,
arsfnily c.mipiled from an extensive exchange,
onvether with all the unatter of interest usually
:ontaiued in an ordinary weekly newspaper.
By this arrangement the readers of the Mir
'or will. bes;des being st pplied with a volume
>f416 large quarto pages of choice literature,
eceive as much news matter in the course of
he year as is contained in most of the newspa
ers of the day. and all for the addititional
hirge of only two dollars to our present sup
-ri ptin price.
We sinc.:rely hope the above plan for onr
bird volume will meet the approbation of every
'riend of southern literature. We have always
:otsidered the Mirror, embracing as it does in
te design, the broad replie oflettdrs, best adap
:d to foster our infant literature. More diver
ihied in the charaf ter of its contents thtan the
graver and more dignified magazine, ranging
is it does froit the the lighter to the more elo.
raled brainches (if literary coioposition,
"From graveto guy, from lirely.to severe."
tis certwiily best -uited to the tastes of the
,reatest nmnitber; and while it affiords equally
,vlaesome and refreshing draughts for the
vell-rend mind, it attracts and lures the young
o drink of the Parnassian str. ant. We have
dimed ii the adoption of the contemplated im.
irovements to plnee the .\lirror upon an .equal
boting with our northern contemporaries in
-egard to cheaptiess; and now, all that - e ask
sin liberal share of that patronage extended to
hen by otr pleple, and we pledge ourself to
-nder'the Mlirror equally deserving their sup
>ort.
