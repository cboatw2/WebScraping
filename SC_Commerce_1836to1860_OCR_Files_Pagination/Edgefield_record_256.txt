before was like the thickening storm, all

07 The following from the Baltimore
American, shows the comparative strength
of the Naval force of the United States,
England, and France.
Our national marine consists of 4 ships
of the line, and 6 frigates of the first class
on the stocks; 2 ships of the line, 1 razee,
3 frigates of the first class, I frigate of the
third class, 13 sloops of war, 3 brigs, 6
schooners, I steam ship and one store ship
in commission, and 5 ships of the line, 3
frigates of the first class; I frigate of the
third class, 3 sloops of war, 1 brig and 2
schooners in ordinary-making a total of
58 armed vessels.
England has in commission 240 sail,
which are disposed of in the following
manner.
On the Home station, 10 ships of the
line, 12 sloop" of war, 20 brigs. On the
Lisbon station 4 ships of the line. 2 frigates
I sloops of war, 7 brigs. On the Medi
terranean station, 8 ships of the line. 6
frigates, 15 sloops of war, 10 brigs. On
the East India station, 2 ships of the line,
6 frigates, 10 sloops of war, 4 brigs. On
the Pacific station, 2 ships of the line, 6
frigates, 10sloops of war, and 6 brigs. On
the Brazil station, I ship of the line, 4
frigates, 6 sloops of war and 6 brigs.
West ladies and Gulf of Mexico, 4 ships
of the line, 10 frigates. 17 sloops of war,l I
brigs. Special Service, 4 frigates, 4 sloops
of war. and 10 brigs.
It will be borne in mind that the above
statement only includes the -hips in actu
al employment, the 'ole naval establish
ment having been set down as ar back as
1836 at 670 in peace, &411 in war one thou
sand and thirty six. The chief difficulty
in the event of putting these ships in ac
tive service, would be in manning them,
and of course impressment would he re
sorted to. In 1836, the number of sea
men employed in British Commerce, was
170,000 men, a pretty abundant source
from which to draw sailors for the Gov
ernment service.
According to the latest returns, the Na
vy of France which is the next largest
and rapidly increasing, stands as follows:
11 ships of the line, first class, 120 guns
each; 23 of second class, 86 guns each; 23
of third class, 82 guns each. This forms
a total of 57 ships, nearly every one of
them built since 1816. Besides this,
France has 40 frigates, first class, each of
60 36 pounders, 10 frigates each of 46 36
poudders; 15 frigates, third class, each of
32 guns; 16 gun-brigs 27 steamers the ma
jority of them 160 horse power and each
of them well armed. In her arsenals
there are nearly 3,000 guns and carron
ades for the naval service, enough to fit
.out 51 ships of the line, 20 frigates and
20 corvettes.
It appears from other statements that
the French government could, immedi
ately on the occurrence of war, increase
the naval force actually at sea-namely.
22 sail of the line and 26 frigates, to 40
sail of the line 50 frigates, that besides the
seamen necessary to man this large ad
ditional fcie, there would remain a sur
plus of 15.000 men to form the crews or
vessels of minor rates or size: it further ap
pears that a Royal Ordinance of the first
of February, 1837, directed that there be
kept up 'Wadvanced towards constrouton,
a reserve of 13 sail of the line and 16 frig
ates, by which the force at sea could be
further raised to 53 sail of the line and 56
frigates,and that the number of war steam
er should be fixed at 40, of which 16 are
now in cotnmnission, and 13 more rapidly
advanctng towards completion.
Every, ship of the line is provided with
four howwitzer cannon.80 potunders called
a.la Pairhonms. Every frigate of the first
class to have 2 of 70; steamboats of 160
horse po wer, 2 of 30; frigates of the 2td
and 3d1 classes, stoops and brigs 4 of 30.
Taking Sir John Barrow's statement,
- which is supposed, from the high standitng
of that gentleman, and his facility ofaccess
to the proper sources of information to be
correct; Er.gland thas in all 19 ships of
. from 100 to 120 guns, of which 4 are in
commnission,12 in ordinary and 3 building.
Of the second class, carrying from 80 to
100 guns, she has 34 in all; 9 ini commts
sion 18 in ordinary, and 7 building. Of
the third class, of 70 to 80 guns, she has
ia all 47, of which 12 are in commission,
33 in ordinary, and 2 huilding, making a
grand total of 90 ships ot the line, 20 of
which are commissioned. Of frigate~s of
various classes there are 93, of which 9 are
commissioned. Of steamners of war she
has a total of 12, of which 5 are commis
sioned, 2 in ordinary, and 5 building, be
sides there are 13 steamers on foreign sta
tions, and 28 post office steamers, .5 of
which are in commission.
France has 49 ships of the. line, 10 of
which are in commission; of wvar steamers
27, of which 12 are in commission, 6 in
ordinary and 9 in building. Here it will
be observed that France is muck in ad
vance of England, so far as war steamers
are concerned.
From ala~te London Paper.
SUN-Pictures-While France and Eng
land contend for the honor of this new in
vention, let the following contrast of the
eonduct of the claimants be placed in par
allel;
"M. Dagnerre's ingenious discovery,
which has assumed the name of 'Daguer
rotype,' continues to excite great curiosi
tv and tiration. It is affirmed that the
Emperor of Russia has offered 500,000f.
for his secret, and that he has declined the
munificent reward. It is not likely that
his friend. M. A rago, wvill stneceed in oh
taining a larger national one from the
Chamibers."-From a Paris letter in the
Post.
M. Daguerre had better secure what he
can for his discovery atoneas.Mr. Talbot,
his English competitor, is determined to
maken no secret of his plan. which wvas de
tailed at the last meeting of the Royal
Society. We give it as concisely as we
ca:
"Tbe subject divides itself into two
heads, the preparation of the paper, and
the incans of fixing the design, To make
what Mr. Talbot calls ordinary photogenic
paper, he selects paper of good firin quality
and smooth surface; none answers better
than superfine writing paper. He dips it
into a weak solution of coimtoon salt, and
wipes it dry,by which thesalt is uniformly
distributed throughout its substance. He
then spreads a solution ornitrate of silver
on one surface only, and dries it at the fire.
The solution should not he saturated, but
six or eight times diluted with water.
When dry, the paper is fit for use for all
ordinary photogenic purposes.
"Nothing can be more perfect than the
images it gives of leaves and flowers, es
pecially with a sumin.er's sun, the light
passing through the leaves, and delinea
ting every ramification of their nerves. If
a sheet of paper, thus prepared, be taken
and washed with a saturated solution of
salt, and then dried, it will be found, (es
pecially if the paper has been kept some
weeks before the trial is made,) that it.
sensibility is greatly dimitihed, and in
some cases, seems quite extinci; but, if it
be wiashed again with a liberal quantity
ofthe solution of silver it becomes again
sensible to light, and even more so than it
was at first. In this way. by 'alternately
washing the paper with salt and silver, and
drying it by tines, Mr. Talbot increases
the susceptibility of the paper."
With regard to fixing the images, Mr.
Talbot. after repeated experiments, finds
that if a photogenic picture be washed
over with iodide of potassium much dilu
ted with water, an iodide ofsilver is form-,
ed, which is absolutely unaltered by Run
shine. This process requires caution, for,
if the solution i too strong, it attacks the
(lark part of the picture. Mr. Talhoil's
usual met bod m. fixing consists in immer
sing the picture in a strong solution of
contmnon s;ah. and tihet wiping off the
superfluous iixture and drying it. If the
picture thus washed and dried be placed
in the sun, the white partsccolorthemnselves
of a a pale lilac tint, after which they bo
come insensible. Those preserved by io
dide are a.ways of a very pale primrose
yellow. which turns to a fullgaudy yellow
whenever exposed to the fire, and recovers
its former color when cold.
Pictures with this prepared paper are
taketi in the ordinary manner with the
camera obscura.
Sir John Herschel has, since the discov
ery was made known, turned his attentin
to this subject, and has already obtained
the pictures from the light ofDanuiell's great
galvanic battery; Sir David Brewster, too,
has taken up ibe investigation.
From tu Pennsylvania Inquirer,
THE %%ORLD ABROAD.
Lord Durhans's report on the Canadas
was circulating far and wide, and apneared
to excite much attention. The London
Weekly Despatch gives an extract which
is particularly eloquent, and will be read
with pleasure on this side of the water. It
runs a beautiful parallel of the effects of
Colonial and Republican Government. as
exhibited in the case of the United States,
and the British Provinces in America.
The Despatch copies it. with a remark,
that "it is for the English people to decide
whether they like monarchy or repulli.
canism, at least in the Colonies." The
passage will he found below.
"On the American side all is activity
and btustle The forest has been widely
cleared; every year numerous settlements
are formed, and thousands of farms are
create-l out nf the waste; the country is
intersected by common roads; canals 'and
rail ro..ds are fitished, oir in t he course of
f'ormtation; the ways ofcomtmunuication and
transport ate crowded w'ith people, anud en
livened by ntumerous carriages and large
steamboasts. The observer is surprised
at the number of harbors 0n the lakes, and
the nutmber ol vessels they contain, while
br'idges, artificial landing pllaces, and comn
'uodious wharfs are formed in all direc
tions as soon as required. Good houses,
warehouses, mills, intns. villages, towns,
an-] oven great cities, are almost seen to
spritng uip out of the desert. Every vil
lage has its school house and place of pub
lic worship. Every town has many ofihoth,
with its townshtip buildings, its book stores,
and probabl3 one or two b)anks, and news
pa[pers,and the cities. wit h their finre church
es, their great hotels, their exchanges,
court houses, and municipal balls, ol'stota
or marble, so new and fresh as to mark the
recent existeince of 'he forest where they
now stand,wou:d he admired in anty part of
the Old world. On the British sidle oft the
litne, with the exception of a few favored
spots, where sonme approach to A'merican
prosperity is alpparent, all seemq waste
and desolate. There is biut one rail road
in all British America, and that, running
between the Sr. Lawrenace andlLake Chamn
plain, is only 15 mile~s long. The ancient
city of Montreal. which is natuirally the
commercial capital of the Cantadas, will
not bear the least comparison int aniy res
pect with Buffalo, which is a creation of
yesterday. But it is not in the dia'erence
between the larger towns on the two sides
that we shall find the best evidence of our
own inferiority. That painful but unde
ntiable truth is tmost manifest in the country
districts thr'ough which the line of nation
al separation passes for 1,000 miles.
There, on the side of both the Canada,
and also 'of New Brunswick and Nova
Scotia,a wsidely scattered populatiotn, poor,
and apparently unenterprising thouigh
hardy and induJostrious, separated fromi
each other by tracts of intervening forests.
without townus or markets, almost wvithout
road-, living in mean houses, drawing lit
tle more titan a rode subsistence from ill
cultivated land anid seemingly incapable
of improving their condition, present the
most instructive conitrast to thteir enterpri
sinig and thriving neighbors on the Ameri
can side."
