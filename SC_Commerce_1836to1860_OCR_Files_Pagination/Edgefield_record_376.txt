The Committee having retired to prepare
the Address, His Hon. the Mayor was loudly
called for by the Meeting, and he responded to
the call in an eloquent manner.
Mr. Memminger, in behalf of the Committee,
presented the following
ADDRESS.
Fdlow Citizens:
We are again summond forth, to defend the
great principles of constitutional right, upon
which depend the liberties and existence of the
South. Hitherto, the struggle betwen the par
ties, which for several years past have divided
the Union, has been one for place and power;
in which South Carolina did not condescend to
mingle. Her position, as the champion of
State Rights, had become one of dignified neu
trality; andshe chose not to soil herermine. Inj
a contest which involved no principle, to which
she was pledged. The prominent candidates
for the Presidency, possessed not her confi
dence; and although one of them had avowed a
perference for the principles of the South, and
thereby had secured the favor of some of our
people; yet the State at large,'preferred to stand
aloof from the contest, until time should test
the sincerity of profession. That test has now
been applied, and the principles of action,
which govern parties, now stand open to the
observation of the world. In the heat ofa long
continued canvass,they have each been brought
to state their true position, and to range them
selves under leaders, whose principles cannot
be mistaken. A combination has been formed,
embracing all those materials, which have so
often threatened the peace and security of the
Union, and is now advancing in full career, to
invade the Rights of the South.
An open war has been declared against the
present Administration, because it has dared to
stand up in defence of the Democratic princi
pies of the Constitution. The partizans of
Abolition, of the Tariff, of Banks, and Con
solidation in all its varied forms have made
common cause. Denouncing the President as
"the Northern man with Southern principles,"
they thereby avow the ground work of their
hostility; and so earnestly and zealously do they
seize upon and pervent to their own purposes,
every element of strife, that it has now become
ite duty of every friend of his country, to re
sist their farther advances. Now, that the bat
tIe is waxing warmest, and real danger threat.
ens, it is not in the generous nature of South
Carolina to decline the combat. Wherever
her friends and principles encounter danger,
there, will ever be four-d her standard, advan
cing to the rescue.
It cannot be disguised, that the great
principles which nw divide parties in the Uni
on, are precisely those, which have been ever
the sub et of controversy since the foundation
of the Governments. There has always been
found a party striving to ride over the Democ
racy, and under one pretext or another it is
found in our country attempting -to secure to
its votaries the whole power and advantages
of the Federal Government. Finding them.
selves hemmed in by the wisdom of the Con
stitution, they have resorted to the device of
constructive powers, and seekc thereby to sub.
stitute the will of a majority, for the Magna
Charta of our Liberties. The people of our
State, in common with their Brethren of the
South, have evei held, that submission to such
a doctrine, is virtually a surrender of the very
Citadel of our Liberties.' It is in fact a repeal
of the Constitution itself, in this opinion were
fully agreed both the great parties which lately
agitated our State. Their only dif'erence was
concerning the remedy against and infringe
ment of tbeir rights. That difference has been
adjusted by events; and we now agein stand
where all originally stood, making common
altar in the great ciause of our Country: All
save that nitmeless cohort wvhich gave uncer
tain support to the Administration while it was
strongest; h~ut which true to its own preference
for Tariff, Banks and consolidation, now aban
dons its allies when assailed, and has made
kniown its secession from the great State Rights
and Uaion party of the South, by hoisting in
our city the self same banner, tunder which the
Ablitionists is marching to invade us.
Under these circumstances and believing as
we firmly do, thatfor the South the period has
arrived, when every free patriot is bound to
take his post, we but owe it to ourselves and
the country, to declare the gronds upon which
we range ourselves with the friendiof Ad minis
tration.
1. It cannot be concealed, that the fixed de
termination, with which the President has car
ried out his inaugural declaration against the
schemes of the Ablitioniists, has concentrated
against him the malace of that faction. In
every State where these incendiaries can col
lect the least force, it is found invariably rear
shalled against the administration; and it is now
become obvious that the defeat of the adminis.
tration is regarded by them as a triumph of
their prir ciplcs. So close is the itimacy he.
tween the opposition and thc Abolitionists that
even in the Halls of Congress, when the clear
est and universally acknowledged rights of the
South are under discussion, the public servants
of the country are found silently desertin their
posts to avoid a declaration of undoubted right,
which might offend their Abolition Contwe
rates. Nay I So powerful seems the Influence
of this alliance, and so closely does it appear in
terwoven with hostility to Southern Institu
dons, that upon a questiori of vital importance
to the South, one of our own Senators is mis
sing from his place, and one half the constitu
tional voice of the State is lost to her support.
Contrast such results with the brave and gen
erous support of the Administration? Dsdain:
ing personal consideration, and regardless of
the clamor of the Abolitionists, they gathered
around the distinguished champion ofourrights
and by their un inching countenance and sup
port enabled him to establish a proposition es
sential to the defence and security of our Insti
tations.
In the other Hall of Congress, the same line
of policy characterised each of the contending
parties. It needs but a mere perusal of the
Journals to establish beyond a doubt, that every
measure which has checked the advance of Ab
olition owes its chief support, and its success,
to friends of the Administration, while those
propositions which evince hostility to our In
stitutions, always originate and are sustained
mo the opposite party. The very fact
(whic e opposition are compelled to admit)
thartheir candidate for the Presidency has de
.lared his opinion that the Revenues of the
Federal Government can be constitutionally,
and ought to be applied to the emancipation of
Slaves, is altogether conclusive, Itproves that
if he be elected President, the Constitution is
no longer the guaranty of our property-but
we hold it under the most degrading and uncer
ain of all tenures-the will of a majority, and
hat majority with interests varied from, and
ven hostile to our own.
2. The next great leading measure upon
vhich we feel bound to make common cause
vith the Administration, is its opposition to a
Bank of the United States. We take it as es
ablished beyond a doubt, that the people of
South Carolina have made up their final judg.
vent against such an institution. They regard
t is both dangerous and unconstitutional; as
tbandoning all the ground which has been
rained againstimplied powers; and asyielding
ip our rights, political and commercial, to the
mnlimited control ofthe section in which such a
3ank would be located. The dangers to a
Iepublic with which such an institution is
'aught, and its disastrous influence over the
ommerce and agriculture of the country, have
iow become matter of history, and it can be
mnly those who prefer the quietude of despot
sm, who would now unite their efforts with
he Opposition party, and propose to the South
o surrender itself at discretion to the tender
nercies ofa fifty or seventy million Bank.
3. The establishment of a steady and constitu
ional currency, is justly considered one of the
nost important measures which the Adminis
ration has sought to promote. In so laudable
ind patriotic a pursuit, we feel bound to yield
hem our entire confidence and support: and
when we consider the peculiarly untoward con
lition of the times, and the array of influence,
nterest and predjudice against which they
iad to contend, in advancing this great meas
ire, we cannot too strongly express our ap
probation and encouragement. Every effort
ias been used by a vast majortity of the par
:izans and debtors of nine hundred Banks scat
.ered throughout the Union, with the U. States
Bank at their head, to attribute to the Adminis
ration evils'which are solely chargeable to the
tpeculating mania, which had overrun the
:ountry, and the crazy issues and errors of the
Banks themselves. But the sober second
hought of the people is rapidly applying the
corrective; and the second suspension of the
Pennsylvania and Southern Banks, contrasted
is it is with the condition of those in N. York
tand elsewhere, which have notsuspended, has
urnished proofof the sound views of the ad
ninistration, and evinces to every reflecting
nind where the true mischief lies, There can
carcely occur any evil of greater magnitude,
han to fasten upon a country an irredeemable
rapercurrency, It blights the very bud of en
erprise, and by subjecting to uncertainty, the
neasure of value, operates with as much harsh
iess and injustice, as though other standards
if value, such as the pound weights and bush
d measures of the country were suddenly and
!apricionsly to he changed. If it were proposed
o our people, that the Bank Directors or any
ther set of men, should be allowed to change
the wveights and measures of the community,
whenever it suited their pleasure, and that con
tracts made under the old standard should be
axecuted according to thre new, the position
would deservedly meet iAth universal scorn -
[twould be perceived at once, that the Bank
Directors or other regulators, could combine
among themselves, and agree upon a day when
the standard should be changed, and that after
that day two pounds for instance should he
melted together acd represent hut one. 0Of
course each man in the secret would go forth
and secure contracts for thousands of pounds
of cotton or any oilher article of value to be
delivered at some period beyond the day thus
fixed upon for the change.
4. Can any thing he more obvious, than that
when the seller is called upon for his contract
and is thus compelled to deliver double the
quantity he had anticipated, right is inyaded,
and the most flagrant injustice has been perpe
trated? And yet precisely similar is the result
which follows the power to expand and con
tract the currency of the country,: a power
which the Banks now enjoy throughout the
Union, and that too without responsibility to
any but their own Stockholders. Is it not ao
parent, that an irresponsible power thus toover
turn the standards of value; thus to expand or
contract the currency; and theteby to enhance
or put down the prices of labor and of all com
modities, is in fact an arbitrary power over every
individual; is a power to increase the rate and
expenses of life of every citizen, and to reduce
at pleasure the accustomed income of the me
chanic, the laborer, and the Agriculturalist?
It is against this irresponsible power that the
Administration has been contending. It is to
ensure steadiness and certainty to the wages of
labor, and to the produce and commerce of the
country, that the President has so earnestly
urged upon the people the necessity of some
cheek upon -the Banks. Can any man doubt,
that if the Administration instead of opposin~g
the reckless speculation of the Western Banks
had lent them its countenance or even declined
to oppose them, that we should have now been
whelmed into a vortext of calamity, far exeeed
ing the worst reality we have yet encountered?
And will any man after the second suspension
the bills of our nearest neighbor.t will any
man propose that the Government should make
them Depositories of the public money, and
present then with a Bonus of from 10 to 16 per
cent fbr debasing the currency of the tountry?
We take it as the settled polity of South Caro
linato fsist any auth fallacy, and as her deter
tinned purpose to join with the Administration
in reaturitig healthful action to the body politit,
4. We regard the opposition of the Adminis'
tration to the system of Internal Improvement
by the General Government as furnishing a
nother clain to our tounfidente and we feel our
selves authorized to call upon the States Rights
Part of the whole South to aid thein in extin
guishing a system so sectional and corrupting.
The people of this State have declared their
opinion so often upon this subject, and are so
fully satisfied of its soundness that it would be
a work of superogation further to discuss the
subject.
5. And lastly, we hold ourselves bound to
make eotamon cause with the Administration
in opposing that profligate parent of Internal
Improvement and of wastefil and reckiess ex
penditures, Tariff for the protection of Domes
tic Manufactures. On this subject South Car,
olina has so recently taken her ground in the
face of the world that it would be vain again to
repeat her solemn declaration. All her sons,
with the exception of that fragment which find
ing no congeniality with the rest, has unfortu
nately strayed into the camp which shelters en
emies; all unite in the great cause of Free
Trade; all insist that when the the Constitution
guarantees freedom to all, none shall be re
spected. and the Manufacturer like every other
Citizen, should be lelt free to competition, and
should not fatten on the spoils of his neighbor.
Therefore be it Resolved;
1. That the present Administration of the
General Government is entitled to our warm
est confidence and support, for the firmness
and resolution with which they have sustained
the great Democratic principles of the Consti
tution, and the rights which are guaranted to
the South.
2. Resolved, That the sound and enlighten.
ed policy which has been prsued by the Ad
ministration to avert the great evils arising from
irredeemable Bank paper, and to restore to the
country a Constitutional Currency, is founded
upon wise consideration of the public good and
is entitled to our zealous encouragement and
support.
3. Resolved. That the uncompromising and
determined stand which has been made by ihe
Administration against the schemes of the Abo
litionists evinces its sincere and earnest regard
for Southern Rights, and entitles the Presi
dent to our confidence and su port
4. ResolvedThat in identifying hiinself with
principles of pblic licy, so essential to the
true poliny of the South, The Hon. Martin
Van Buren has entitled himself to its confidence
and support, Bui as t-itizens of South Carolina
we pledge ourselves tosustain his re-election as
President of the United States.
5, Resolved, That the Hon. J. C. Calhoun,
our Senator in Congress, is entitled to the
hearty confidence and suppoit of his fellow
citizens for the ability and zeal with which he
has vindicated the principles of the South, and
promoted the best interests of this State, and
more espetially for the ability and eloquence
with which, in his place in the Senate of the
United States, unaided and alone, he has re
presented the feelings and principles of the
Legislature of S. Carolina.
After the reading of the Address, Mr. Mem
minger, in a very eloquent speech, advocated
the claims of the present Administration to the
support of this State.
Col. F, H, Elmore, then rose and respond
ed to the loud and frequent calls made for him.
He was followed by the Hon. J. S. Rhett.
After some discussion, the Address and Res
olutions were seperately ut to the Meeting,
and were unanimously ado ted.
Upon motion of Robert %Votherspoon, Esq.,
it was

We copy to-day, from the Charleston
Courier, a balance sheet of 1839, of the
Fire' Insurance Company of Hamburg,
Germany, that great, ancient city. This
is done in order to show that a very near
likefiess exists befween that city and our
own aspiring town, Its name sake, in A
merica. In Hamburg, Germany, there is
Water continually flowing through the city,
by means of cauals, &c., beside the other
beneficial arrangements against fire, which
will be seen on reference to this balance
sheet. In Hamburg, America, pure, fresh
water is continually passing, in reservoirs,
through the principal streets, from the
abundant and never failing aprings which
rise out of the hill, and extend far aro-ind
the limits of the town, and only req,.res
the closing of the well arranged flood
gates, to give a full supply of water a.
gainst fire, at any emergency. Indeed,
taking the history of the two cities in view,
we will find that each is very near alike
in many respects. Their Hamburg bor
ders on the river Elbe, and our Hamburg
on the river Savannah, both never failing
streams.
If, therefore, their history be so closely
connected, should they not be allied to
each other in commerce and good feeling ?
They are. ' And should not the editors in
these two cities, situated in different quar
ters of the globe, exchange papers for in
formation, although we cannot read Dutch
ourselves, yet the Founder of our Ham
burg can.-Hamburg Journal.

The Robbers Again.-On Wednesday
nighs last, or rather on Thursday morning,
about four o'clock, an unsuccesful attempt
was mado to force the brick fire proof safe
to Messrs. C. & F. Matheson, attached
of their counting room. One of the young
men who sleep in the store was aroused
by the noise of the villians, and on making
his appearance at the door, they fled to
wards the back lot; he then returned, put
Dn his cloak and took a pistol with him;
on reaching the back lot, he discovered
two persons whom lie took to be negroes
secreted in a corner formed by the fence
and the back store. They immediately
Red on his approach, when he fired on
them, but with what efrect, if any, is not
known. One of them appeared to be a
tall fellow dessed in a round jacket.

A neto Kind of Light.-A store has
lately been opened at No. 110 Walnut
street, for the sale of Webb's patent cam
phine oil and lamps adapted to burn it in.
From the brilliancy ofibe lights made use
of in the store, one would suppose the ar
ticle well calculated for 1ts purposes. We,
are told that the lights produced by this
manufactured oil, are more economical
than either the common lamip oil or gis
in addition to which is more pleasant on
account of its neatness, the flame not even
soiling the wick of the lamp, and emiting
no smoke. A numberof our citizens have
already tried it, and if it protve truly as re
presented, of which we have no reason
lo doubt it, it is an invenion of impot tance
ro the public and one which will secure a
rortune to the patentee.-Phil. Ledger.
Pride of a Cot.-A porrespondent in
rorms that, while on a visit at the country
house ora lady, it one day happened that
they passed the cow housejust at the time.
when the dairy maid was drivihg home
the cows to be milked. They all passed
in quietly enough, with the exception or
one, which stood lowing at the door, and
resisted every effort of the deiry maid to
itiduce her to enter. When the maid was
interrogated as to the cause of this obstina
cy, she attributed it to prIde; and, when
surprise was expresed at this, shte explain
ed that'wheh any other of the cows hap
pened to get in before hear, this particular
cow would seem quite affronted, and
would not enter at all, unless the others
were turned out again, and she had an
opportunity of walking in before them.
This statement having excited curiosity,
and a wish to ascertain its accuracy, the
mnaid was desired to redouble her exertions
to induce the cow to enter ; on which she
chased the animal through every corner
iof the yard, hut without success, until she
at last desisted from wtant of breath, de
claring that there was no other .remedy
than to turn out the cows. She was then
permited to make the experiment ; and
no sooner were the others driven out thatn
in w alked the gratified cow, with'a stately
air, her more humble minded companions
following meekly in her train.-Penny

A Prominent Cause of the Depression of
the Price of Cotton.-It will be recollec.
ted by those who read for the pursose of
storing ibeir minds with facts, that in the
year 1837. Humphrey and Biddle, the
Liverpool agents ofthe Bank of the United
States, issued a circular, proposing to ad
vance on cotton at the value of 14 cents
per pound. This arrangement of the
Bank agents bad the effect of concentra
ting in their hands a heavy amount of cot
ton in the hands of the agent of the Bank,
upon which a certain price was demanded.
This was the object avowed in the circu
lar, to prevent the depression of the price
of cotton, acd to compel the manufatur
ers in England to buy at that price.
Iustead of producing the effiect intended,
it had the effectof producing a combina
tion among the manufacturers at Manches
ter, to buy sparingly, thereby preventing
the consumption of the usual quantity.
The consequence was, when the new crop
came to marker, the greater part of the
previous crop wad on hand. in the hands
of the agents of the Bank of the United
States. The new crop being immensely
larger, added to the large amount already
on hand, glutted the market, and as the
value of any commodity depends on the
relative amount of supply and demand, it
requires no particular skill in political
economy in determining what cause has
produced the present depression in price
of cotton. It had its origin in the impro
per interference of the Bank of the U.
States, in going into market as a purchaser
of cotton-Noarth Carolinian.
The New-York Herald, of 15th inst,
cobtains a long list of American vessels,
said to have been engaged in the slave
trade, on the west coast of Africa.
Among them is enumerated the "Charles
ton, of Charleston, sailed from Gallinas,
in January last, with 300 slaves." This
is incorrect. The only vessel of the name,
owned here, is the brig Charleston, which
left here 11th Not. last, for St. Valley,
(France,) from thence proceeded to Paler.;
mo, and sailed for N. Y., and is now, we;
understand, up for Baltimore. The Charles
ton sailed from here some year or so agr,
for the coast of Africa, from thence tor
Pelermo and Malaga, and came home'
with a cargo of fruit, &c. but was cer
tainly never engaged in an way with the'
slave trade.-Charleston 'ouier.
