has been difficult to raise money on the best pa.

stated some days ago, on respectable au- j j

of the Western Land-Offices, and then resold
by the Land-Officers at a premium,
we were contradicted in the usual courte
ous style of the Goternnient paper, and |
defied to produce any specific fact to jus- j >
tify the statement. Though our general,,
information wasuwioudtedly true, we could j ,
not travel out to Ohio to obtain specifics- . j
tions, and therefore liad them not to give, j |
We have, however, just received one, and
wo hasten to place it before the eyes of1
the Executive, and of our readers, as fol- ',
lows: J |
from "the whig," at maxsfield (oiho) : 1

We extract the following from a letter {I
received by us a few days since l>om a j 1
gentleman of high respectability :
" Being in the immediate vicinity of the j''
Land-Otficp, 1 have an opportunity ofj1
seeing many quetr things transacted, and '
will give you one among the many daily J
and almost hourly taking place. A man
came in, wishing to enter five half sections
of land, and offered in payment SI,875 of
a New York Safety Fund Bank, and he
was informed by the agent that, by the
orders from the Department at Washing- [
ton, tfcfoy were prohibited receiving any j
money of a less denomination than $5, or j
money of any bank other than dcposite i
banks. Here the man was in a predicament,
for, if he went to get his money exchanged
for such as was receivable under
these orders, some one might enter the
very land he had selected to settle himself
and sons upon. What could he do 1
The agent very obligingly helped him out j
of his trouble by exchanging his own prirate
money with him, for live per cent. 1
premium, in which operation he pock- !
eted the trifling sum of $83 75, and the f
man has to pay, in reality, $1,958 75
for five half sections, being $83 75 more
than the law of the land requires. But
mark the seauel! The same day a nier- ;
chant wanting funds that would go at the j
East, paid this land agent 2 per cent, pre- !
mium for this same money, being $39 17
pocketed by the agent, making $122 92
clear share our of tu>o individuals, on the \
same money, in one day. How long people i
will submit to this fraudulent system o(kna
vmg them out of their industrous earnings, j
time must determine. If they will keep;
in power such men as wiil stoop to any j
fraud, however glaring and obvious, to ag- \
grandize co-partisans they ought to suffer i
the consequences. The above is but a j
specimen, and such specimens are but the I
commencement of a system of operations !
admirably calculated to make the * rich ;
richer, and the poor poorer;'and tho whole
to be done under the pretence of benefitting
the poor and laboring classes of the
community."
We are authorized to state that the departure
of several detachments of the Marine
Corps for the South is in consequence
of a voluntary offer of the commandant of
that corps to the President of the United
States, to lead his corps to the scene of ac.
tion in Alabama. It is one of the valuable
qualities of this corps, that it is equally
effective for sea and land service.

1 . treaty with the cherokees. \
The Treaty lately concluded with the
Headmen and Chiefs of the Cherokee Indians,
by Wm. Carroll and John F.
Schermerhorn, on behalf of the United
States, for the purchase of all the lands owned,
claimed, or possessed by the Cherokees
east of the Mississippi, as ratified by the
President and Senate of the United States,
has been officially published. The Treaty
at large is too long for our present limits,
and we must therefore content ourselves
with stating its leading provisions. The
sum stipulate*! to be paid by the U. States,
in consideration of this cession, is five mil- i
lions of dollars. The Indians are to be
transported by the United States to the west
of the Mississippi, and settled on lands specified
in the Treaty, &c. Of the five millions
of dollars purchase money, the following
sums are to be invested by the United
States, some safe and most productive
stocks of the country," for the benefit of
the whole emigrant Cherokee nation:
For a General national Fund, #200,000
For an Orphans' Fund, 50,000
For addition to the Scheo! Fund, 15O.0DO
The annuity of 810,000 a year, to which
the nation is now entitled, is to be commuted
for a sum of 8214,000, to be invested
by the President of the United States as a
part of the National Fund.
A supplementary article stipulates for the
payment of an additional sum of 8600,000
by the United States to defray the expense
of removing the Cherokees, and to cover all
claims for "Spoliations," by which indefinite
phrase we do not very weiJ know what
is meant; and adds 8100,000 more to the ,
General National Fund. Nat. Int. J
Tunnelling,?There is beginning to \
be quite a rage for constructing tunnels j
under rivers. It was determined some- j
time since, to run a tunnel under the |
Hudson river opposite Albany and in or-1
der not to be behind the New Yorkers, it is i <
proposed in Philadelphia 4o make a tun-1 j
ncl undei the Schuylkill. It is stated i
that Mr. Gilpin, an "accomplished Engi- J
ueer, on Thursday evening last submitted 1
to the council of that city a plan, with a communication
upon the subject, which 1
was accompanied with a series of draw- t
ings illustrative of it. The communica- 1
tion was ordered to be printed and the
matter referred to the committee on city

:ime siuce appointed a committee to express i (
to Mr. Clay their regret at learning that he :
liad spoken of retiring from public and re-j <
rjuesting him to reconsider the subject. The !
following is part of Mr. Clay's answer to j
the letter of the committee : | c
This is the thirtieth year since I first en- c
tered the service of the Federal Govern- j
men?. My labors for the Public have been (
various and often arduous. I think they j
give me some title to repose, which I feel to t
be necessary on many accounts. 1 believe I (
with you that the present period in the af- ; |
fairs of our country is eminently critical. g
It requires all the wisdom, the virtue, and ,
the energy among us to avert impending .
danger. If I were persuaded that, by re- j
maining longer in the public service, I could .
materially aid in arresting our downward ,
progress, and in communicating additional !
j ?'?
security to civil iineny aim our ncc n?uiu* %.
tions, 1 should it my duty not to quit it. 1
But I am not sure that my warning voice (
has not been a (ready too often raised. Per. *
haps that of my successors may be listened i
to with more effect. I sincerely hope it 1
may be. ?
These, gentlemen, are briery my motives
for retiregrcnt. It is my purpose, if my
health will allow me, to remain in Congress t
during the present session. I reserve for (
future consideration whether I shall servte <
out the term for which the Legislature of
my State did me the honor last to elect me; j
and your wishes will have due weight in |
any decision I may form. Beyond that term, j j
I can conceive of no probable contingency j (
which would reconcile me to a further con- j,
tinuance in the Senate. i i

We understand that the Engineers who
have been in the mountains some time, are
busily and constantly engaged in their arduous
duties, and that they speak very favorably
as regards the practicability of constructing

The General Conference of the Methodist
Episcopal Church, now or recently in |
session in Cidcinnatti adopted the following
preamble and resolutions on the subject of j
abolition.
Whereas, great excitement has pervaded ;
this country on the subject of modem abo-;
litionism which is reported to have been in- j
creased in this city recently, by the unjusti-:
liable conduct of two members of the Ge- j
neral Conference, in lecturing upon and in :
favor of that agitating topic; and, whereas, j
such a course on the part of any of its mem- j
bers is calculated to bring upon this body !
the suspicions and distrust of the commun-;
ity, and misrepresent its sentiments in re. i
gard to the point at issue, and, whereas, in
this aspect of the case, a due regard for its
own character, as well as a just concern for j
the interest of the church, confided to its j
care, demand a full, decided, and unequivo- j
cal axpression of the views of the General!
Conference in the premises; therefore,
J Resolved, hj the delegates of the annual;
i conferences, in General conference assembled,
That they disapprove, in the most unqualified
sense, tire conduct of two mem.
j bers of the General Conference, who are re.
ported to have lectured in this city recently
upon and in favor of modern abolitionism.
| Resolved, by the delegates of the annual j
| conferences, in General conference asscm.,
! bled. That they are decidedly opposed to j
modern abolitionism, and wholly disclaim i
any r.'ght, wish, or intention, to interior*"1 *n ;
the civil* and political relations between
master and slave, as it exists in the slave,
holding states of this Union. ,
Resolved, by the delegates of the annual '
conferences, in General conference assent- \
bltdy That they foregoing preamble and re- <
solutions be published in our periodicals. '
