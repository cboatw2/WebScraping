PROTEST OF TIIE.PRESIDENT
To the House of Representatives:
By the Constitution of the United
States it is provided, that "every hit!
which shall have passed the House of
Representatives and the Senate, sliall. before
it become n law, he presented to the
President of the United States; if he opprove,
lie shall sign it; but if not, lie shall
return it, with his objections, to that
House in which it shall have originated,
who shall enter the objections at large
upon the journal, and proceed to re-consider
it."
In strict compliance with the positive
obligation thus imposed upon rne by the
it was addressed. If, in assigning my
objections to the bill, I had so far forgotten
what was due to the House of Representatives
as to impugn its motives in
passing the hill, I should owe, not only to
that House, but to the country, my most
profound apology. Such departure from
propriety is, however, not complained of
in any proceeding which the House has
adopted. It has, on the contrary, been
expressly made a subject of remark, and
almost of complaint, that the language in
which my dissent was couched was studiously
guarded and cautious.
.Such being the character of the official
communication in question, I confess I
was wholly unprcpated for the course
which has been pursued in regard to it.
In the exercise of the power to Tegulatc
its own proceedings, the House, fcr the
first time, it is believed, in the history
of the Government, thought proper,
to refer the Message to a Select Committee
of its own body, for the purpose (as
my respect for the House would have compelled
me to infer) of deliberately wcighIn"
1K0 Alii***tinns ur<red arrainst the bill
" =?
by the Executive, with a view to its own
judgment upon the question of the final
adoption or rejection of the measure.
Of the temper and feelings in relation
to myself of some of the members selected
for the performance of this duty, I have
nothing to say. Thnt was a matter entirely
within the discretion of the House
r.f Representatives. But that committee,
taking a different view of its duty from
that which I should have supposed had
led to its creation, instead of confining
itself to the objections urged against the
hill, availed itself of the occasion formally
to arraign the motives of the President
for other of his acts since his introduction
into office. In the absence of all proof,
and as I am hound to declare, against all
Jaw or precedent in parliamentary proceedings,
anJ at the same time, in a
manner which it would be difficult to reconcile
with the comity hitherto sacredly
observed in the intercourse between inde
pendent and co-ordinate departments of
the Government, it has assailed my whole
official conduct, without a shadow of a
# j
pretext for such assault, and, stopping
short of impeachment, has charged me,
nevertheless, with offences declared to deserve
impeachment. Had the extraordinary
report which the Committee thus
made to the House been permitted to remain
without the sanction of the latter, I
should not have uttered a regret, or complaint,
upon the subject. J5ut, unaccompanied
as it is by any particle of testimony
to support the charges it contains,
without u deliberate examination, almost
without any discussion, the House cf lie
preservatives lias been pleased to adopt it
iis its own, and, thereby, to become my I
accuser before the world. The High j
character of such an accuser, the gravity i
of the charges which has been made, and
the judgment pronounced against me, by
the adoption of the Report upon a distinct
and separate vote of the House, leaves
ine no alternative but to enter rny solemn
protest against, the proceeding as unjust
to myself as a man, as an invasion of rny
constitutional powers as Chief Magistrate
ol the American People, and as a violation,
in my person, of rights secured to
every citizen by the laws and the Constitution.
That Constitution has entrusted
to the House of Representatives the
sole power of impeachment. Such impeachment
is required to be tried befoie
1 he most august tribunal known to our
institutions.
The Senate cf the United States, composed
uf the Representatives of the sovereignty
of the States, is converted into a
hall of justice, and in order to insure the
strictest observance of the rules of evidence
and of legal procedure, the Chief
rif the United States, the highest
judicial functionary of lite land, is required
to preside over its deliberations. In
the presence of such judicatory the
the voice of faction is presumed to be
silent, and the sentence of guilt or innocence
is pronounced under the most sol-1
einn sanctions of religion, of honor, and;
of law. To such a tribunal does the Constitution
authorize the House of Representatives
to carry up its accusations
against any chief of the Department
whom it may believe to bo guilty of high
crimes and misdemeanors. Before that
tribunal the accused is confronted with
hia accusers, and may demand the priv
lege, which the justice of the common
law secures to the humblest citizen, of a I'
Constitution, not having heen ahle to
bring myself to approve a hill which originated
in the House of Representatives,
entitled, "An act to provide revenue from
inijiosts, and to change and modify existing
laws imposing duties on imports, and
for other purposes," I returned the same
to the House, with mv objections to its
becoming a law. These objections,
which had entirely satisied my own mind
of the great impolicy, if not the unconstitutionality,
of the measure, were presented
in the most respectful, and even deferential
terms. I would not have heen so
far forgetful of what was due from one
r?
department of the Government to another,
as to have intentionally employed in
my official intercourse with the Mouse,
nny language that could be, in the slightest
decree, offensive to those to whom
full, patient and impartial inquiry into the c
facts, upon the testimony of witnesses, ri- s
rrillly examined, and deposing in the face |
of dnv. If such a proceeding had been <:
adopted toward me, unjust as 1 should cer- i
tainly have regarded it, I should, I trust, t
have met with a becoming constancy a ! r
trial as painful as it would have been un- i
deserved. 1 would have manifested, by a i t
profound submission to the laws of my t
country, my perfect faith in her justice, [
and relying on the purity of my motives, t
and the rectitude of my conduct, should J
have looked forward with confidence to a t
triumphant refutation in the presence of t
that country, and by the solemn judgment s
of such a tribunal, not only of whatever
charges might have been formerly prefer
* " A ?II tknn??l!imnmcnr 1
reu agasnsi me, uui ui an mc bniun>u>w
which I have hitherto been the unresist- j ,
ing victim. As it is, I have been accu- j .
sed without evidence, and condemned j
i without a hearing. As far as such proceedings
can accomplish it, I am deprived
of public confidence in the administration J
of the Government, and denied even the '
boast ofa jrood name,?a name transmit.
j
ted to me from a patriot father, prized as
my proudest inheritance, and carefully !
preserved for those who are to come after; 1
me, as the most precious of all earthly '
possessions. I am not only subjected to j(
imputations affecting my character as an '
individual, but nin charged with offences
against the country, so grave and so hein- !
ous as to deserve public disgrace and dis- ,
franchisement. I am charged with violating
pledges which I never gave; and
because I execute what I believe to be "
the law, with usurping powers not con- 1
ferred by law ; and above all, with using 1
the powers conferred upon the President '
by the Constitution from corrupt motives 1
and for unwarrantable ends. And these I
charges are made without any particle of (
evidence to sustain them, and as I so- '
lemnly affirm, without any foundation in (
truth. !
Why is a proceeding of this sort adopt- 1
ed at this time ? Is the occasion for it '
found in the fact, that having been elected
to the second office under the Constitution
by the free and voluntary suffrages j'
of the People, I have succeeded to the '
first, according to the express provisions:,
of the fundamental law of the same Peo- 1
pie? It is true that the succession of the 1
Vice President to the Chief Magistracy J
has never occuircd before, and that all
prudent and patriotic minds have looked ,
on this new trial of the wisdom and sta- j
bility of our institutions with a somewhat,
anxious concern. I have been made to ,
! feel too sensibly the difficulties of my un- J
prccedented position, not to know all that !
is intended to be conveyed in the reproach |
cast upon a President without a party.? |
But I found myself placed in this most i
responsible station by no usurpation or
contrivance of my own. I was called to ,
it under Providence, by the supreme law
of the land, and the deliberately declared '
will of the People. It is by these, the |
People, that I have been clothed with the ' (
high powers which they have seen fit to j;
confide to their Chief Executive, and been i
charged with the solemn responsibility un- j
' der which those powers are to be exercised.
- - " it *
It is to them 1 nold myself answeraoie, as | \
a moral agent, for a free and conscientious &
discharge of the duties which they have , 1
imposed upon me. It is not as an ;a
individual merely that I'm called on to re- ; 1
sist the encroachment of unconstitutional j
power. I represent the Executive author- ;
ity of the U. Stales; and it is in their J
name, whose mere agent and servant I am,'t
and whose will declared it their funda- j
I mental law, I dare not, even were I in-) clined,
to disobey, that I protest against
every attempt to break down the undoubted
constitutional power of this department :
without a solemn amendment of that fun-1
damental law. !
I am determined to uphold the Constitution
in this, as in other respects, to the
utmost of my ability, and in defiance of
nil personal consequences. What may l
happen to an individual is of little impor- J
tance; but the Constitution of the country,
or any of its great and clear principles
and provisions, is too sacred to he sur- rendered,
under any circumstances what|
ever, by those who are charged with its!
| protection and defence. Least of all ! r
should he be held guiltless, who, placed at j .j
the head of one of the great departments ti
of the Government, should shrink from I1
the exercise of its unquestionable author \ ! '
ity on the most important occasions, and ?

face all the barriers so careful!}' create j *
by the People to control and circumscrib- j
the powers confided to their various; 1
agents. It may be desirable, as the rnn- j
jority of the House of Representatives has j
declared it is, that no such checks upon I
the will of the Legislature should be suf- J
fered to continue. This is a matter for j
the People and States to decide ; but un- J
til they shall have decided it, 1 shall feel 'I
myself bound to execute, without fear or
favor, the law, as it has been written by J
our predecessors. j
I protest against this whole proceeding 1
of the House of Representatives, as ex \ '
parte and extrajudicial. I protest against'
it, as subversive of the common right of! j
ail citizens to be condemned only upon a b
fnir imnartial trial according to law and t<
?. ? r w :
evidence before the country. I protest j
against it, as destructive of all the comity } jt
of intercourse between the Departments i ai
of this Government, and destined, soonei ti
or later, to lead to conflict fatal to the; l'J
peace of the country and the integrity of
the Constitution. )
1 protest against it, in the name of that or
Constitution, which is not only my own j
shield of protection and defence, but that ^
of every American citizen. I protest
against it, in the name of the the People, ^
bv whose will Island where I do, and by j ?
whose authority I exercised the power
which I am charged with having usurped,<
and to whom 1 am responsible for a firm '
and faithful discharge, according to my j
>wn convictions of duty, of the high I
tewardship confided to me by them. I ;
>rotest against it, in the name of all re- l
,minted liberty, and all limited Govern- J
ncnt, as a proceeding tending to the uter
destruction of the checks and balances
>f the Constitution, and the accumulating "
n the hands of the House of Representa- |(
ives, or a bare majority of Congress for g
he time being, an uncontrolled and des- c
>otic power. And I respectfully ask, that
" ' i l
Ins, my l'rotest, may oe emerea upon mc

of such a proceeding.

:n, enlighten, and adorn it with their moon- a
hine. Consequently no man more than the
igriculturist needs the full use of his brains,
ind a perfect command of all the treasures of
mman experience. So the fanners of the
Jnited States view tbc matter; and in pre;enting
thein with a translation of the celc.
jrated Maison Uustique, of the French, we "
:-ive no doubt of their hearty support. It ic ,
he work cf all works on practical agriculture j*
?the most scientific, clear, and ccmprehen- J
live, France has long" excelled in profitable b
arming. This is the source of Iter wealth. \
Sngland is rich by coals and commerce. Her
igriculturc is "splendid, but sometimes costs n
nore than it comes to. Those who have tl
ortunes to spend may buy the vast works of r
Marshall, Dickson Arthur Young, Loudon,
Lc., but those who wish to gel a fortune out
)f the soil will find the French writers better "
iblc to show thein the way. The excellence
jt French clementa;y works is well known to
til teachers. For centuries, the A/aison
ftustique has been, in France, the standard .
dementary work?the spelling book and
jrammar of farming. The present pdition for {
4 the nineteenth century," has been re-wriu- ,
;cn and brought up with the "march oJ rowd/' ,
by sixty of the ablest "agronomes" of France. <
It has all the light of the latest improvements, i
lot only in Frauce, but in all Europe. t
William Cubbct, one of the most successful i
"armers both in England and America, who t
vrote the best style and the best French
rrammcr that ever was, valued the AJaison c
ftustiqnes, not only as an encyclopedia of fl
arming, but us a means of educating his 8
children. He was his own schoolmaster. In
vinter evenings his family resolved itself into
? school, and he thus speaks of the use then
nade of this work:? _
14 Our book of never failing resource was
he French Maison Rusiiquc.or Farm House, t
vhich, it is said, was the book that first tcinp- ; g
ed Dugnosnois (I think that was his name,) ' ^
he famous physician in the reign of Louis j,
(IV., to learn to read. Here are all the four- t
egged animals, from the horse down to the
nouse, portraits and all; all the birds,reptiles,
nsects,- all the modes of rearing managing,
md using the tame ones, and of destroying
hose that are mischievous; all the various
raps, springe, nets; all the labors of the field
ind garden exhibited, as well as the rest, in ^
dates; and there was I, in any leisure mo- a
nents, to join this inquisitive group, to read j,
he French, and tell thetn what it meaned in
English, when the picture did not sufficiently
xplain iiself. I never have been without a
opy of this book for forty years, except during
he time that I was fleeing from the dungeons i
f Castlereagh and Sid mouth, in 1817, and
vhen I got to Long I.-lund, the first book I b
ought was another Afaison Rustique.''?Ad- n
ice to Young Men, Art. 291. fi
Of the qualifications of the translator, it may v
ie said that he is a Dractical farmer, and in 1'
egard to his translation of La Fontaine, which
las been reprinted in England, an English reiewer
confesses I hat he 44 does not know the ?
English writer who could have done it better.'' ?

Jniversal Soap, which will remove stains, distt

This article is superior for washing flannels,
too lens, linens, luces, silks, and calicoes, to
tny now in use. (t is warranted to contain no
ngrcdient that will destroy, rot or injuro, in tho
ea.it. texture or color : nor will it iniure the
lands, but will render them soft and hi, when
lone washing, to engage in sewing, if necessary,
"or cleaning paint it is unrivalled.
