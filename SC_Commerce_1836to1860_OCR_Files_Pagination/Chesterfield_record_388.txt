been committed, consists of Messrs.
Crittenden, Clayton, Walker, Hunting^
ton, Williams. Norvel, and Nicholas.?
Each of these gentlemen is in favor of a
bill of some sort, and a majority of them
are in favor of the voluntary scheme.?
But it is presumed that they will frame
a bill embracing the compulsory system
tta a modified form, and that their project
will pass the Senate. Both the Carolina
Senators are opposed to any bill.
The Senate seems to have engaged
lately, with much earnestness, in the
President making business. Several of
their recent debates on the relative mer
its of Harrison and Van Buren have
been very racy and piquant Yesterday,
the discussion of the same engrossing
topic was renewed, upon a motion to
print twenty thousand copies of the reportof
theCommittee on Military Affairs,
Dn Mr. Poinsett's grand scheme for training,
equipping, and arming the militia.
This report is designed to counteract the
Unfavorable political effect which Mr.
Poinsett's project had in some parts of
country, and especially in Virginia. It
does not condemn nor. approve of the
plan, but explains it, and offsets General
Harrison's reports on the same subject
against Mr. Poinsett's. The subject,
according to the report, employed
much of the attention of General Washington*
and of his successors. General
Knox made a report in favor of a national
organization of the militia; and General
Harrison, while in Congress, made
three reports, strongly recommending a
plan somewhat similar to Mr. Poinsett's.
Mr. Roane, of Va., Complained much of
the use made in his State, by the opposition,
of Mr. Poinsett's plan. It was
kept quiet from December till April, butwas
then disseminated throughout-Virginia,
on the eve of the election, and
^ held up to the people as a plan for a
standing army. Mr. Webster said he
would not object to print any number of
this explanatory report, provided tne
original report of Mr. Poinsett was appended
to it. Mr. Preston condemned
Mr. Poinsett's plan in most decided
terms, but contended that there Was an
essential difference between it and Gen.
Harrison's. It was final I v agreed to
print General Harrison's three reports,
and Mr. Poinsett's, side by side, But
the motion to print 20,000 extra copies
of the white-washing report) as some call
it, iies over.
By the way, the friends bf Gen. Harrison
have raked oirtdf the House, some
old papers, which they intend to make
great use of, in his favor, at the South.
ifiUhe year 1803, General Harrison being
the Goverhorof Indiana, a convention of
the people of that Territory was held, at
which it \va9 resolved to memorialize
Congress in favor of a repeal of that part
of the Ordinance of 1787, which forbids
the introduction of .slavery into the
States and Territories North west of the
Ohio. The memorial is signed by Gen.
Harrisoit, as President of<he Convention.

THE GAZETTE.
WEDNESDAY MORYHG, JOE 17.
j ,.
The letters of Col. Preston and Gen.
: Thompson we insert, by request, as connected
with the proceedings of a public
meeting which formerly appeared in our
columns*
No contest for the Presidency ha9 been
more animated than the present, per.
haps none so much so, since the one in
which the elder Adams and Thomas
Jefferson were the candidates. The opposition
party are stimulated to extraordinary
exertions by confident hope of
success, while the Administration party
without despairing, are evidently alarm,
ed. The. changes in favor of General
Harrison, within a few months, have
been numerous, and in instances not a
few, by persons of high respectability
and no small influence. Among the
circumstances which indicate alarm
the party in power, is the resignation by
Mr. Kendall of his place in the President^
cabinet, to take charge of a temporary
paper, published avowedly for
the exclusive purpose of influencing the
election. In accordance with the purpose
of shewing our readers, as far as
our space will enable us, the ground taken
by the two parties, we this week
copy Mr. Kendall's ^Address to the people
of the United States," and shall follow
it next week with Gen. Thompson's
Circular to his constituents. The w^ek
j after, we shall insert part of the address
of the Baltimore Convention of the Ad
ministration party. We copy Mr. Kendall's
address only on account of his relation
to his party* as a recent member
of the cabinet, and as* ttow, about to
become an editor of its leading organ;
which circumstances seem .to give a kind
of official sanction to his statements, and
to his exhibition of the ground on which
the party appeal to the Country for support.
The .address does not contain a
fair exposition* nor in fact any true exposition
at alt, of the distinctive principles
or policy -of the great pariies into
which the country Is divided. It wants
dignity for the production of an ex-itlembcr
of the cabinet, and makes a false
issue; - It labors chiefly to shew that the
opponents of the present administration
?one half, perhaps the bigger half, of
'the people of this country?are influenced
in their politics by a "contempt for
the people," that is, for themselves; that
thpv arp pnpmies to the frepdnm and
fairness of elections, ready to usurp the
rains of Government and maintain the
usurpation by military despotism; No
man of ordinary intelligence believes*
or can believe this to be true of any
great party in the county The facts
to which Mr. Kendall refers, when fairly
stated, lead to very different inferences
from those drawn by him. But it is fiot
our purpose to analyze or review the
address. We point to the fact that*
contrary to what was to be expected on
such an occasion* it contains nothing
even resembling an outline of the politics
of the country. In regard to the general
principles of Government and in devotion
to our popular institutions, all par^
ties in this country agree, and, have
ever agreed since the commencement of
the revolution. He who says differently,
s/anders the country, and manifests either
a want of intelligence* or a disregard
of truth. The currency and sub-lreasury
are now the great subjects which divide
the people into administration and antiadministration
parties; but they are not
even alluded to in Mr. Kendall's address.
: Why* it is not our purpose now to in|
quire. We do not espouse the cause of
either party, but shall always aim to take
care, that neither is misrepresented in
any article which we copy;
[communicated.)
FOURTH OF JULY;
At a meeting of the citizens of Che fa w
and vicinity, held at the Town tiali
Thursday evening,' 11th inst., L; B.
Prince was unanimously elected first
Orator, John A. Inglis second Orator,
and Alexander Gregg Reader for the
approaching Anniversary of American
Independence/.
The "Yorkville Pioneer" is the title
of a new paper, published at Yorkville.
S. C. The second No. we have received.
It contains nothing from which the
politics of the paper can be learned;
Mr. Rayner and Dr. Montgomery*
members of Congress from North Carolina,
have had a JUlicuff rencountre near
the door of the Representatives Hall,
during a recess of the House. Whilst
the Doctor was delivering^ .a" speech in
the House, Mr. R. interrupted him a
few times. In the speech, as afterwards
published in the Globe, Mr. R. .was rei
, dial union of the Democratic party, tha
i it may be promptly withdrawn by m
, friends from before the public."
i The plain meaning of this is that h
wishes still to be a candidate.
presented as having cut rather a ridicu
lous figure. He published a correctioi
of what he considered a misrepresentation
of what he had said. This caller
forth a publication from theDoctor, whicl
so enraged Mr. R. that when he methii
opponent, he poiinced upon him* Aftei
some breaking of canes, and scratching
and hair pulling, they were separdtec
Without any very serious bodily injury t<
i either. The following sentences w<
copy from the Doctor's account of th(
battle, published in the Globc:?-"I had
no sword cane, or arms of any kind, not
supposing my colleague would be guilty
of the cowardly attempt at assassination,
in which, I fear, from his conduct, I was
mistaken.-" "His conduct has been that
of a mean, cowardly scoundrel." "From his
cowardices or some other cause, he was
unable to hurt me;" "He has acted the
part of a base coward and unprincipled
scoundrelMr. R. replies in the National
Intelligencer, and says the Doctor's
account of ^thr afTaif "is false in
the main, both as to facts and insinuations.
The expulsion of both the honorable
gentlemen, would do the House
of Representatives more honor than any
-thing which it has done during either the
present or last session.
The Convention of the State Rights
party of Georgia, held on the Uth inst.,
nominated a Harrison ticket for electors,
with only one dissenting vote. Judge
Berrien was President of the Convention,
and was appointed to prepare an
address to the people of the State on the
subject.
The Convention also nominated the
following ticket for Congress: William
C* Dawson, E. A. Nisbet, J. C. Alford,
R* W. Habersham, T* B. King, Lott

Unpatriotic Recklessne6S of Party.?The
following paragraph is taken
from an electioneering address to the
people of New York, by one of the political
parties in the late Legislature of
that State. No man of common sense,
who kno\Vs an^ thing of the hisfbry of
the Revolution, can doubt that the writer*
and the most intelligent circulators of
such a statement, know it to be false:
"The early history of this Republic too abundantly
proves that many of those who took part
in the Revolution, fought for independence rather
than liberty. They rebelled against a monarch
abroad, for the purpose of setting up a monarch
at home. Placed at a distance from the throne
of Great Britain, they had liltlo chance to parti,
cipate in it* honors, its titles, and its pensions;
and they aimed to erect a throne in America, around
which they might form a band of privileged
nobles. No sooner was the object achieved
and the States separated from ihoir parent land,
than these subjects began to dcvclope thorn,
selves in the writings and acts of some of the
revolutionary leaders."
Congress.?This body is still in ses
sion, and no time fixed for adjournment.
In the Senate the Bankrupt bill has not
jet beett disposed of. Efforts were made
by leading Administration members to
include state banks in its provisions.-;This
Was opposed on the ground that if
Would be an usurpation of jurisdiction
over state legislation, and it finally
failed. The Senate refused to postpone
the bill indefinitely, thereby indicating
a disposition to pass it in some form;
A bill to allow the heirs of Robert
Fulton 8100,000 is before the Senate,
but meets with opposition.
The Presidential election, which occupied
so much time in the House
during the session, has been introduced
in the Senate, on a motioti to print af
pvtra nnmhpr nf the renort of the Com
mitfcee on Military affairs on a project.o:
Mr. Poinsett for arming and disciplining
the militia.
In the House the sub-treasury bill is
still under discussion.
