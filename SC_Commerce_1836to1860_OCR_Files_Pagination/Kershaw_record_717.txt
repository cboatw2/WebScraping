CAROLINA RAILROADS.
The depots at Charleston, Columbia and
Hamburg, as well as the intermediate stations of
the rail road, continue to exhibit the encouraging
pro-pec's of an increasing and profitable business.
The full employment given at this early period
of the business season to the freight and passenger
cars, aid ihis too while the rivers have all
been navigable, and the facili'ies for boating uninterru;>"e
1, alliird the strongest indications that
no o'.ber mode n!'transportation can compete successfully
with rail roads. The receipts on the
road since i's completion to Columbia, even during
'.be three most unprofitable months of the
year, and when hitherto those months did not pay
expenses, and at a period too of unparalleled depression
in the trade ofthe country, are all favorable
symptoms for the future. The month of
October, ho. ever, has opened with renewed vigor,
and could we exhibit daily receits with those
of the great Western, the comparison would not
probably be found to the prejudice of the Carolina
roads. The stockholders have every encouragement
for the success of the great enterprise;
and those who have stood by it through good and
through evil repott, will yet realize expectations,
if they do not permit themselves to be overreached
by those who never sow the seed, but
are always ready at harvest to reap the^crop
which has been made by the toil or others, ^rrna
Carolina rail roads, from their latitude, from the
character of the country they intersect, as the
"centre link in the great rail way communication
between the Atlantic and the West, are among
the best located in the United States. When
the links in the great Atlantic chain between the
South and the N'orlli Carolina rail roads, extending
continuously to Boston, and those between
South Carolina and Georgia, communicating
with the Tennessee' river, are completed?as
most assuredly they will be?there is no estimating
the amount of travel and traffic which will
flow to our Carolina rail road. We have every
thing to cheer, nothing to damp our expectations,
and ere twelve months roll over our heads, the
appreciation of rail road stork will be as rapid as
is the speed of 'he ocomotive which has worked
cut .'"or us this problem of success.#

Assumption or ?t.ate Uebts?Thecommunicnr.o'i
subject which we publish to-dav,
is "rota a h:g!i y respectable source: a.id will rcce.ve,
we trus , the attention which it merits.
It would Yir.lly be worth while to argue against
so nbsu-d a proposition as the assumption of the
S'ate <!e! by 'he General Government, (which
has as much indebtedness of its own as itutan
conveniently dispr.FC of,) were it not that cer
tain papers, which Isold a somewhat prominent
stand as party organs, are soberly advocating
the measuie. Possibly they may think that t-.e
advocacy of assumption will be popular w th a
majorhy oft: e people; anil that thus political
capital may be made out of it. But in this they
are'gro.vly mistaken, or we are. The vo'e in
Congress at the las session, which was nearly
unanimous against assumption, is, we believe, a
fair exponent of the will of the people Some
may tie induced N? favor the measure from a desire
to place the country in a position 'o rey.i.ro,
for an indefinite period, t j,c highest dn'ics upon
imports which can he coilee'ed Bu here, too,
the people are unques'ioiiahly in the negative
Such duties as are necessary tor -?ri economical
administration o! the Goverttmen', ami fur the
gradual evi.iction of the existing debt, the people
are doubtless in favor of; but not of fathering
the results of State improvidence and log
rolling. Several of the Sla'es are entirely Iree
from debt. Is it probable they will consent to
assume, either in whole or in part, the debt of
those Scales which are bankrupt? Surely not.
the assumption of Slate debts at the close of the
revolutionary war has been appealed to as a precedent.
But tbc t wo cases are wholly unlike.
Those deb's only were assumed which had been
incurred directly for the national benefit. It
was, in effect, a repayment of money, &c., advanced
by the S'ase to achieve tlie national independence.
V /|ien any more such debts are
found to exist, by all means let them be assumed
and paid by the nation. These must be paid by
the parties who contracted thetn.

DEATH OF WASHINGTON.
The following vivid and touching sko'ch of >
the last moments of the Father of h:s Country!
is froin a letter in the New York American: I
Passing the great hall ornamen'ed with pic-j
tores of English hunting scenes, we ascended |
the oaken staircase, with its carved and an'ique <
balustrade. We stood at the d.ior?we pressed
the handle?the roo:n and the bed where he j
died were before us. No'bing in the lo'ty dra-1
ma of his existence surpassed the grandeur of'
that final scene. The cold, which he had taken
from exposure in overseeing some part of his
grounds, and which resisted the earliest domestic
remedies that were applied, advanced, in the!
course of two short days, into that frightful j
form of the deseasn of the throat?laryngitis ?
It became necessary for him to take to bis bed.
His valued friend, Dr. Craik, was instantly
summoned, and, assisted by the hest medical skifl
of the surrounding country, exhat.s ed all the
means of his nr:?but without atlording hitn relief.
lie patiently submitted, though in great
distress, to the various remedies proposed; but
it became evident, from the gloom se thug upon
the countenances of 'he medical gent lemen, that
the case was hopeless. Advancing insidiously,
the disease had fastened itself with deadly certainty.
Looking with perfect calmness on the
sobbing group around him, he said: "Grieve
no:, my friends; it is as I auticipa'ed from the
first; the debt which we all owe is now about to
be paid: I am resigned to the event." Requesting
Mrs. Washington to bring hirn two wills
from his escrutoirc. he directed one to he burnt,
and placed the other in her hands, as his last
will and testament; and then gave some final
I instructions to Mr. Lr.tr, Ins secretary and re
| Jation, as to the adjustment ol Ins business af
fairs. He soon after became greatly distressed;
and as in tlie paroxysms, which became more
frequent and violen*, Mr. Lear, who was extended
on the bed by his side, assisted him to
turn, lie, with kindness, but with difficulty,
articulated: "I fear I give you great, trouble, sir;
but perhaps it is a duty we all owe, one to
another: I trust you will receive the same attention,
when you shall require it."
Ah the night waned, the fatal symptoms became
more imminent. His breath became more
labored and suffocating, and his voice soon after
failed him Perceiving his end approaching,
he straightened himself to his full length; he
folded his own hands in the necessary attitude
upon his chest; placing his finger upon the pulse
of his left wrist, and thus calmly prepared and
watching his own dissolution, he awaited the
summons of his Maker. The last faint hope of
his friends had disappeared. Mrs. Washington,
stupefied with grief, sat at the foot of the bed,
her eyes fixed steadfastly upon him; l)r. Craik,
in deep gloom, stood with his face buried in his
hands at the fire; his faithful -black servant
Christopher, the tears uncontrolled trickling
down his face, on one side, took the last look of
his dying master; while Mr. Lear, in speechless
: grief, with folded hands, bent over his pillow on
the other. Nothing broke the stillness of his
last moments, but the suppressed sobs of the
afleel iollcl'U seivants ofrHeotwd on I ha- ?
the tick of the large clock in the hall, as it
measured off, with painful distinctness, the last
fleeting moments of his existence; and the low
moan of the winter wind, as it swept through
the leafless snow-covercd trees; the laboring
and wearied spirit drew nearer and nearer to its
goal?the bload languidly coursed slower and
more slowly through its channels?the noble
heart stopped?struggled?stopped?fluttered
, ?the right hand slowly slid from the wrist, upon
which its linger had been placed?it fell at
tlio pnln?and the manlv effigv of Washington
was all that remained, extended upon the death
couch.

The committee in charge of the publication of this
paper, find the time to be arriced wheh they can cenfidently
appeal to their brethren for support. At the
meeting of the last Convention it was resolved, almost
unanimously, to establish a denominational paper.
Intelligent and liberal friends from every part
of the State, subscribed their names to a Provisional ^
Fund. But at an rdjourned meeting held at Charleston,
in January, tho plan of the Convention was
found impracticable; and the delegates present resolved
themselves into a now society far tiM?ltablishment
of a Paper. *
The committco of this Society, so far as tho tinfavorable
state of the times would permit,have sine*
been maturing their plans.
Having found obstacles in the way of raising any
Guarantee Fund, they have adopted a plan which
only calls on their friends to procure lubtcribers to
the paper, -It is now, tliercforc, requested that they
will interest themselves in obtaining subscriptions
without Jclay; as it is important that the names and '
number of subscribers should be ascertained at as fSS

tion lists should he forwarded to cither of the under*
signed Committee of publication at Charleston.
They wished to make the title of their paper appropriate.
-Perhaps they have been .Soutoekniks in
the degree of lassitude thus far exhibited. They
now wish to exhibit a Southern warmth and earnestness
of purpose. By "God's blearing, they .mean to p
establish a denominational paper of high, character.
Among our Northern brethren a Baptist Literature
is developing itself. On every topic, and in overy
size, they havo a full supply of our publications.?
We wish to shew that the South is no ancoDgeniial '
oil for that Literature; and to present "the leaves of

and the opportunities for gratifying it, are

We are Baptists. The denomination throughoutthis
region wants a newspaperman organ of correa- ^
pondence and co-operation, for which precious
torials are every week floating by us. Opposed to
parade in religion, we know the value of established
communications between the wings of an advancing
army; that much as we cherish Temperance, there ^
is one thing better ihan "cold water to a thirsty soul,"
i. e. Gospel good news. We hope then to have good,
news both from the Temderance canse, and of the ?
pouring out of the wutcrs of life, at home and abroadfj??to
pjesent to a thirsty people. There is nothing *
which our denomination wants mor&'than eokeaioa
and the deep feeling of common interest, which & tit
well sustained Baptist paper would be a great agent
in supplying. . i;. ' V-*
At Charleston we think we can best advocate this
i
interest- The denomination has appeared both in
former limes, as well as in the late movement of the^".Convention,
to concnrin this. We are hero locally
favored with the earliest of all considerable Intelligence,
Religious and Secular. It spreads from this
point all over the South. We shall aim to make
this paper the only one which many brethren will
tuko. It will contain a carcfl digest of prices, and

There will be some original features in our plan.
'Sabbath Schools and Hints for Teachers" in them* ?
kvill regularly occupy a department. "Books for
Minister* and close Students of Scriptures"?"Bibli*
:al Criticism" and "Female Reaeing." We often
,vant more and con buy fewer books, in the samo
hard times," Do not our Ministers universally
eel this? Tho more important then is selection,
ind
"The lettered grain from lettered chaffto sift." 4
No Southern City affords greater facilities for a
;ood account of "New Books," than Charleston. ^
Tho Committee havo succeeded in engaging the'-'V;
arvices of the Rev. Dr. Twos. Curtis, as Editor.
