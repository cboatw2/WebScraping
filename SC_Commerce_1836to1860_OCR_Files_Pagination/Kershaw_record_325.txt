PiiOUKEriS OF THE NEW JERSEY
CASE.
The proceedings in our columns show
the result of the attempt on the pari of the j
opposition to stifle the record evidence in!
regard to the returns made by the judges
of election to the Executive oflice in that
S:ate. It was decided by a vote of 10(5 to
101 that lite evidence should be read.?
Three of the false certificate men front N.
Jersey?Messrs. Aycrigg, Yorkc and ll.tls'ed?were
seen to pass between the tellers,
to be counted in favor of the motion
to suppress the testimony showing the circumstances
under which they obtained
iheir certificates. This shameful act was
challenge 1 by Mr Vandcrpoel, and ihqui
r/ demanded by tbe House; bul it wus
vaiv.-d in consequence of some one near
the tellers announcing that the majority
was in favor of the reading of the evidence,
whether the votes ofyihe parties interested
were or were not counted. It was
apparent that the condnct of these individuals
excited disgust in several of the highiniuded
members in the opposition, from
the South. We have no doubt it was also
the feeling of some of their Northern
friends, although not so visibly expressed.
The documents which Mr. Duncan has
brought out from the Clerk's table have
produced already at least one good result.
Mr. Randolph, who has taken the lead in
defence of his Federal colleagues from N.
Jersey, being questioned by Mr. Vanderpoel,
did not dare deny the facts which the
testimony was intended to establish. It
will be seen, on reference to !\Ir. Vanderpoel's
interrogatories and .Mr. Randolph's
replies, that the latter admitted facts which
make out conclusively the fraud imputed
imputed in this case. He admitted that
their Democratic opponents had the majority
on the polls, as canvassed and returned
by the judges of election. He admitted
that the vote of two whole townships
had been suppressed by the clerks)
to wln m they were sent for transmission
to the Governor. He admitted by his'
silence, when Mr. Wise intterposed to
prevent an explicit admission in words,
that these county clerks had no right to
withhold any part of the returns entrusted
to them for them for transmission. It
should be known that these county clerks
have nothing to do with the elections.?
They do not attend them as public officers;
they are merely designated in the
law to receive the returns from the township
judges of election, and forward them
as if they were so many postmasters, to
perform this function. Neither the names
of the voters nor the ballots were sent to
them, but simply the results of the polls.
Tliev have no means of knowing, nor au
thority to enquire, who gave the votes?
nor is there the slightest pretext for assuming
that the.) ha' e a right to question,
in any form, the validity of the votes adjudged
to be good by the judicial tribunals
ut the polls.
What a case does this present! The N.i
Jersey certificate men come to the House
of iicprescetatives of the United States,1
confess that their antagonists have a majority
of votes adjudged to be legal by those
who alone had the right to decide?confess
that they were deprived of this certificate
by a flagrant violation of duty on
the part of the transmitting agents ?confess
that they obtained their own false certificates
through the frauduldent conduct
of the ministerial agents, tneir wen-Knowu
political partizans; and upon this stau of
the case they claim their seats in the housto
consummate the fraud by organizing
the body in such a way as to defeat tin
will of the majority. It is not doubted
by any but that this crime was committed
to put it in the power of the enemies "I
the administration to get controul of the
House of Representatives; and it is endent,
if they can effect that objpct b) forcing
their own votes, they will not hesitate
to maintain themselves there by the
same means. We may add, thai it is the
first instance on record, where a party,
whose scat was contested, ever voted to
obtain or retain a seal for themselves in a
deliberative assembly.?Glubc.
[The following are the interrogatories
alluded to in the above article. We are
unable to give the whole proceedings in
the case, but believe the above, with the
the extract which we published last week,
from the Globe will afford the reader a correct
view of the matter.?Ed. Jour.]
The first question Mr. Vanderpw-I would
ask that honorable gentleman [Mr. Randolph]
was, whether, according to the ballot
boxes, and the canvass made by the
r.rnvassing officers who received the votes
Mr. Dickerson and his colleagues did not
receive a majority of the popular votes.
Mr. Randolph replied yes; that including
the voters who were disqualified and
had no right to vote, they did.
The next question he would ask the
gentleman, was, winner, ti inc towns ol
Anibov and Millvillc were included,
Mr. Dirk'wsnn and his associates would
have a majority of the popular votes?
Mr. Tiuudolph responded that they
would; that he \tould not deny that the!
t uviis nfAUIville and South Amboy were
I'trliidcdhy the Governor and Privy Council
in casting up the votes.
Mr. Yanderpor] said he would a<k another
question for information from the
);i!:i:h'iii.in. After the board of canvassers,
the primary tribunal, hud canvassed the
voles and returned their certificates of the
votes to the rutin ty clerks, could the conn-]
ty clerk-*, or Governor and privy council,
according to the Jj'-vs of .Now Jersey, go
inli) the ballot h<;S?-9 anil reject vote?, on i
the ground that the votes of aliens or oth- i
rr disqualified persons had entered the
boxes. I
I Mr. Randolph was about to rise, and
1 Mr. Wise here arose and objected to this i
course of catechism as being out of order; I
and while he was going on to show that it I
wis not in order, i
Mr. Vauilcrpocl snid he would waive the i
question and answer it himself. i
Mr. V. said ihat he had heard much about
''overleaping the law," but he was in- I
duced to ask the question in order to show
I. I
that these gentlemen wiio were such sticklers
for tiic laws of New Jersey, 'were
themselves sanctioning a most palpable
violation of law; but as gentlemen objected
to the question, it was needless to press
it, and more especially, as he, in common
with every other gentleman on this floor 1
who could read the English language could I
? ? o
answer it. lie had merely questioned the
gentleman, in order to have die irresistible i
conclusions ot that geutlcman1s mind superadded
to the clear interpretation of a
statute of his own state Let gentlemen
read the law of New Jersey, and they will
look in vain there for any authority on the
part of the mere returning oflicers, the
clerks of counties, or the Governor and
privy council, to enter the ballot boxes,
and reiect votes, on the ground that voters I
J e
were disqualified. They were mere re-1
turning ofiicers, ami could not arrest voles
on their way to this House, the only appellate
court, after the primary court, the
board of canvassers, the keepers of the i
i ballot boxes, had decided upon their qualitications.
No one had pretended, no gentleman
could pretend, that the county
clerks and Governor and privy council
could act in a judicial capacity and purge
the polls. These, then, were most important
admissions made by the only undisputed
member from New Jersey, and the,
nrdpnt friend and supporter of the. claims
<>f the Governor's members. We could
now have no further dispute, either about i
the facts of the case, or the laws of New
Jersey. They were not only incontesiihly
proved by the papers on the Clerk's I

This is a noble sentiment, and was given
by Mr. Secretary Woodbury, at a 4th

time or place, we do not now recollect; nor
is it material, so l?nn as it embodies truths
of vital importance to the success of the
principles of Democracy, and is alike applicable

MR. CALHOUN AND THE TARIFF.
We take the liberty of laying theiollowing
Jcitcr ot once before the public. It
explains the circumstances under which it.
it'nc find it nneniiirnrnllv rnfnlps
the rumor in circulation, and defines the !
position which Mr. Calhoun maintains In j
relation to the Tariff". May wc not go j
farther, and infer, that no politician who;
entertains this unqualified opinion of the
Tariff, will support Mr. Clay's Land Bill,
or any other scheme with which it may
he associated? Who w II divert the proreeds
of the Public Lands from the Public
Treasury, unless he is prepared to increase
the duties on foreign importations,
n order to fill up the vacum? With such i
j -pinions, who will support the scheme of
! wresting the proceeds of the public lands |
for the purposes of National Education, .
of a National system of Internal Improvements,
or carrying out the modern project
of a new Assumption of the State |
debts? Not Mr. Calhoun, certainly. lie
must disapprove the end, as well as the
cans, lie must not only disapprove any
augmentation of the Tariff, but with the
strict constitutional doctrines which he
avowed in his speech at the last session,
he must deny the power sought to be
usurped over the great subjects of Internal
Improvements, of National Education,
and of the local debts of the several States:
Let these subjects be pressed, whenever
they may, we have no fear but tlicv will
call out able champions sufficient to subdue
them:
Fonr Hill, Nov. 22. i
Dear Sir: I have received the Enquirer
containing the article from the Providence
Journal, which among other things asserts
that I have come out in favor of a high
Tariff. I conclude that I am indebted to
you for it, as, in the conclusion of your
comments, you say that you will enclose
the number containing it to me, and ask;
ol me some notice of the subject.
You were right in presuming the rumor'
unfounded. It lias not the shadow of!1
foundation; and yet,-if I may judge from i
the papers, that and similar rumors have, '
for sometime, been widely circulating in i
the Northern portion of the Union; but for
what purpose, or by whom put in circula- '
lion, I am nt a loss to conjecture. So far i
from favoring, I believe of all calamities <
that could befall the country, a renewal of I
the protective system, with its certain c ?n- I
sequences, would be among the greatest; JI
and it really is surprising, that with the <
light of past'expericnce, any one of sound {<
judgment and attached to the country,; <
shall think of miking the attempt. I Ail-11
ly agree with you that the South, and, Ijl
trust, the great body of tho sound and ji
patriotic parties every where, cannot ho j I
gulled by the fallacious .arguments put >1
forth in its favor. The growng intclii-'j
gencc of the age is opposed to all such j I
schemes, and all attempts at the renewal |;
of the protective system must fail; or if <
>;
successful, would be followed by a revolution
which would prostrate the system,
with infinite greater loss titan gain to the
manufacturers themselves.
I have not seen Gen. Hamilton in the
recess, and cannot speak for him; But I
have no doubt that the rumour is as unfounded
in his as in my case. In fact, 1
may sav, that the united voice of this
State, including all parties and every pursuit,
is opposed to the system, As far as
I am informed, I scarcely know an exception.
With great respect,
1 am, &c. &c.

TUP. "WHIG" CANDIDATE.
Well, the " Whig" assemblage of the
"collective wisdom" of that enlightened
body, have met at Harrisburgh, and selected
the renowned hero of North Bend,
as their candidate for the high office of
President of the United States. All hail
to the sagacity of the " Whig" counsels?
all hail to the oracular decree of "all the
decency, all the talent" of the nation,
which proclaims that General Wm. Henry
Harrison is to be the President of this
Republic We, in our poor conceit, did
indeed think, that Henry Clay, of Kentucky,
had claims to the support of the i
"Whigs," to say nothing of his acknowledged
abilities, that would place him infinitely
above Gen. Harrison, in their es
timaiion. But what is our weak opinion
compared to the sublime conceptions of
some half dozen ex-governors at the head,
and some hundreds of ex-membrrs of Congress,
assembled in solemn council at
Harrisburgh atlhe tail, and both embodying
the life and soul of the great soi disant
Whig party? Certainly, it is none of our
business?but we rather think that the
Abolitionist had a voice in lavincr Mr. Clay
"" - " ? * - #o - - I
once more on the shelf. His eleventh'
hour speech couM not be forgiven?and
the illustrious Norih-Bcndcr is sure of
their votes. We, of the South, however
will probably counterbalance, if not overturn
this sage calculation. And where
can Gen. Harrison get a vote South of
the Potomac? What press will so far forget
what is due to our Institutions, as to
raise his black llag at its masthead? Wc
shall see!
Wc have before prognosticated the utter
annihilation of the " Whig" party; and !
this move most certainly fortifies our be-'
fore expressed opinion. i\Ir. Van Burf.n;
will walk over the presidential course in j
18-11, at a calm pace, and will have nothing
worthy of the name of a competitor.
Let us then give ourselves little more trouble
in the matter; as the "game in view
ii scarcely worth the powder."

Th5 negro Damon, mentioned in our j
last as taken off by the Indians returned
to this city on Sunday morning. He states
that as he was riding through Long Swamp
at a brisk pace, he came suddenly upon
Mr. Wcadman's wagon, and thinking all
was not right, was turning his horse round
when two Indians sprung into the road,
seized his bridle, and forced liiin off?
They took him to the wagon, where one
of them struck the boy Bartolo, with the
but of his rifle until he appeared dead.?
rhe volunteers were now heard coming,
when the Indians gathered up their plunJcr
and retired with the horses about one
hundred yard into the swamp, where they
remained, until the volunteers had gone

SOUTH CAROLINA LEGISLATURE.
This Body adjourned, according to a <
joint resolution, adopted on the 13th inst. i
last night. IIow much of the business be- I
fore them has been accomplished, we are
not advised, the journals which have come i
to hand are only up to the evening of the j
14lh. The most important matter which i
the Legislature has had under their consideration,
was the Report of the Circuit 1
Solicitors, who were appointed at tho last (
session, under the following Resolution; ,
Resolved, That the Reports of the At- I
torney General and the Circuit Solicitors, i
together with the accompanying docu- i
ments, in relation to District Office.--: also i
a Bill the better to regulate the fees of<
Sheriffs, Clerks, and other officers of the if
State, and a IJi'.i concerning the liabilities
of Constables, postponed at this session,!,
be referred to them as Commissioners un- '
dor the joint resolutions in relation to District
officers. 1
In pursuance of this Resolution the So-,1
licitors reported several Bills. The first j'
providing for the appointment ol a District j1
Police, to discharge the duties of Commis- j?
sionrrs of Roads, Tree SrHoois, ramie;;
Buildings &, Approvers of Public Sccuri-j
ties, and a variety of other matters. This!'
Bill, we regret to learn," has been lost.? j I
The other Bills referred to the ofticc of '
the Clerk of the Court, Sheriff, Ordinary. <
Magistrate anil Constable; together with a 1
new Fee Bill.' Tho most, if not all, these .
latter Bills we learn, were likely to pass,;<
and we hope it may be so. From a hasty i
perusal of the Report, sometime before 1
the meeting of the Legislature, we were
much pleased with the various rccomnirn- i
dations Although there are not many ail- JI
ditions proposed to the laws already in j <
force, regulating these offices, yet the old|
laws and recent decisions are so embodied! <

case, without wading through the Icgisla- j(
turc of the last forty years. I'
These Bills, together with one reported. y
by a Military Commission, also appointed '1
at the last session, and also a Bi.'l to pro-; s
vide against thefuture suspension of specie j
payments by the Banks, constitute the most j
importantsubjects of legislation which have!
been under consideration. The Bill in I
relation to the Banks, proposes to give I ^
those which have suspended till April to1
resume, ami if afterwards a suspension Is
takes place, the Bank is to paj* the State]
Treasury, 7 per cent per annum, 011 its',
whole circulation, during the period of sus-j j
pension?the Banks to accept this Bill
part of their charters, or proceedings to! ^
be inslirutcd 1?v the Attorney General to
r ' a
procure a forfeiture of those which have
suspended.
It must he admitted or nil hands, that
something ought to he done to remedy the! ^
evil of frequent suspensions, hut we fear}''
this measure is rather too strong, and will 1
operate as hardlyjon the community, if not 0
more so, than upon lite Banks. 3
Great exertions are made in the House l'
to get the Military Bill through. The ''
thirty-third section of this Dill is objee- l'
tionahlc. It is as follows:
"The commanding ofliccr of any divi- ^
ctnn Iiritrnde. rcirimcnt, battalion, or com- T
v"' " O ? o
panv, who shall call out the men under his! w
command, to muster, shall have power to j,
appoint a suttler to retail spirituous li- .
quors, at tiie muster ground of such di- ri
vision, brigade, regiment, battalion, or v
company, without any other license or ir
permission: Provided, the suttler so ap- j
pointed, shall furnish a suitable field to exercise
the troops in, to be approved by the P
officer who shall have ordered such inus-il'
ter." n.
A motion was made on the 14th ins!, to C
strike it out, and was lost; yeas 43, nays V
40. The delegation from this District vo- ll
ted in the negative.
The Committee to whom was referred v<
the Temperance Memorials, have rcp.orted B
two Bills and a 'Resolution. One repeal-[ ei
ing the suliltf's law, (whieh is thi* one n+
furred to above, embodied in the new mUir.
lary bill,) and which has passed that body;
the other providing for throwing the estates
of habitual drunkards into Chancery.
The Resolution affirms that Commissioners
of Roads, &c. may either grant or refuse
licence as they see proper.
We have no doubt the thirty-third seclion
of the military bill will be stricken
out in the Senate, and we have as little
doubt that the Ilonse will concur.
CONGRESS.
We have dates to the 13th instant from
Washington, at which lime, there seemed
to he as little prospect of an organization
of the House of Representatives as at any
other period, since the members arrived j
at tlic Scat 01 uovcrnmeni. several umc?
ihe difficulties were, apparently, on the
point of being settled, when new questions
would be started, and whole days exhausted
in debates which thus far have produced
no beneficial results. On the 11th intunt,
after a Resolution, offered by Mr.
Wise, directing the Clerk to call the Whig
members from New Jersey, had been rejected,
Mr. Riiett proposed the following
resolution:
'Resolved, That the House will proceed
to call the names of gentlemen whose
rights to seats are not disputed or contested;
and after the names of such members
ire called, and before a .Speaker is elected,
they shall, provided there be a quorum of
such present, then hear and adjudge upon
he election returns, or qualifications of all
dain.-ants, (Mr. Ingersuli and Mr. Naylor
?\ccptcd) to the scats contested on this
lour.
The resolution was agreed to. Yeas 138,

worse confounded.
The Senate, although organized, is, of

thing, until the House is prepared tor business.
A communication has been opened
between the Seriate and President,
