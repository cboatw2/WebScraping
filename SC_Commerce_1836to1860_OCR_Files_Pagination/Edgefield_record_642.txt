mtuniention was made to the Common
Council, by the Mayor, last evening;
M1.voa's Otcy., City of New
York, A pril 4th, lS842.
To thec Honaorable, thec Board of
AlUdermen ofthe City of Nero York.
Gentlemen-Since my private consult a
lion on Thursday Last with the members
of both boards of the Common Council in
relation a the absence and defalcatiou of
Thomas Floyd, collector of the city reven
ue, infor-matneu has been .htained making
it no longer necessary for the interests of
the city to obaerve the secrecy upon this
subject which our united judgment deem
ed advimoble. Believing that publicity
will now best subserve the interests of the
city, I have determined to make this com
munication to you and solicit authority to
offer a reward for the apprehension of Mr.
Lloyd, and for the restoration of the mon
ey supposed to he in hisi possession. In
this cotunuication ? will give you all the
information I laid before you on Thursday
last and that subsequently obtained.
On the28ih of March I received informa
tion from the comptroller,.that on that day,
upon reaching his fice, he found a, letter
fromt Thomas Lloyd, collector of the city
revenue, hearing the post mark of the oflice
of this city of thre 28th of March, and the
letter dated the 22d of Marcha, inaforminig
the comptroller that owing to a reso
which had passed your honorable body on."
the evening of the 21st, requiring all cal
lecting officers of the corporation to return,
under oath. at each payment by them into
theTreasury of the ciy, that the amount
paid is all that has been collected by him,
he determined to leave the city for Charles
too, as he stated, to collect a debt due there
to him, (Lloyd) for the purpose of paying
the amount to the Common Council.
There being no evidence of the daalca
tion of Floyd. other than his going off, and
his letter, which mantioned to amount, the
comptroller sent to the d:'rent tenants of
the Common Council. nmd also made ex
aminationintothe hank where Lloyd kept
his privateaccount. The compiroller by
this meins discovered that on the 21st day
of 3arch Lloyd drew up his (Lloyd's)
check for the bank, $4,779,07, and that ie
bad received from tenants $6.000, which
he had not paid into the city Treasury.
We have also discovered that he owns
real estate in the city of New York anl in
the state of New-Jersey. The drawing of
this 84,77907 from the bank, and not pay
ing it into the Treasury, was such evidence
of premediated fraud that there could be
noconfidence placed in his statement that
he was going to Charleston. We there
fore institifted inquiries in other quarters.
and from these sources discovered that
which induced us to believe ie had gone
to Charleston. I have catused nsa attach
meat to be issued against his property in
thestate of New York. This writ not
only altaches any property he may have
in ibisstate, but also all debts that may be
due to him. An attachment has also been
issued against his property in the Stair of
New-Jersey. I have also had an aflidavis
made. setting forth his conduct and bring
ing him within section 59 of page 365, ;e
cond volume. Revised Statute., second
editiona, which taken in connection nith
sections 3G ard 37ef besamc rolume. page
587, defines the offence to be a feloy,
punished by imprisunment in shestate pri
son. I have sent an officer to Charleston
with this affidavit Since all this has been
done, the Comptroller by investigation
among th tenants of tho Corpcraiionu. has
discovered that the amount of Lloyd's de
fales tion is about $30.000.
The u'tcsof receipts given by Floyd to
tetnatats show t11t much of this amount was
received by Lloyd fumediately before lie
absconded, consequent hb must have a
large amount of money with him. we
have since ascertained that there is great
reason to believe that Lloyd bailed from
this port on the 23d of March. in a brig
called the Hope, of which he is supposed
to be owner, bound for "Cape d Vens
and a market." For these reasons I have
deemed it to be for the interest of the city
to make the matter pulaic, and to oflir a
reward for his apprehension, as a fugitive
from justice, and also a reward for the re
covery of the money be hasgone off wii.
This money may be taken from him in the
mann'- -' at any stolen property might.
e attachment issued against'him
e, his house andl furniture have
upon, and the payment of all
a suspended. When trustees
under these procedings. all
d to Lloyd will be compel
ment to them. Under the
. .,.es f'or Lloyd, I am informed,
are good for $15000t, thc amount of their
bonids.
I deem this a proper occasion to call y our
atension to the autiicncs iu amaountt of
security directed by ordinance to be given
lay manny of thec collecting officers of the
city government. and to the itmproper pratc
tice that hais always obtained amonuag thoase
officers of depositing she public mniateys to
their iaahvidual accounts, and patyitng such
amounts as they choose over to she chamt
berlain of slhe city. rTere has beven nao
check upon ihese orlicers except to ascer
tain from the debtors at' she coarporationa
whether they have paidl he amsounat oftheir
indebtedne~s, or any portion thtereof. T[his
practice has enabled collectors to use. the
public moneys for private purposes -ex
posed shoem to the imp1ortunaities of frienids
and s'cutrisies, and led to te moany del
caions that have iherctofore occurred
among previous collecting otlicers oif th<.
city govertnment. It is a temtpsatioan ns icha
has induced many improperly to usc the
city moneys.
To obvi'ate this evil. I suzgest that the
Comm~ton Counceil lay ordinance direct ;all
its receiving officers to deposite the moneys
col!ed by thent in their ntame~ as officers, ini
ette bank to be designated lay ordinanice.
That the moneys so deposited shall only
be transferred to the chtamberlaint of the
city by cheeks signed in thte oaficial capa
city oft the collectoar, tot the order af the
chamberlain, anti endorsed by him. anad the
moneys only tto be drawn from she bank
lay the check of Commion Council, to the
order of the persona having a demand against
the city government. That the cutllectoars
of the revenue at short intervals make their
deposities, and imamediately after each de
posito make before she Mayor andl tile ina
his oflice an affidavit of the deposite, anid
from whoma the montey collected by htim toa
that period. This mecttod would prevett
he use of public moneys for private pur
poses, and remove that temptatioan which
has and will utnless remtaved, not only dlis

character and standing of matny citizens.
