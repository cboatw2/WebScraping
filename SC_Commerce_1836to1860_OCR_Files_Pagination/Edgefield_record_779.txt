DONALDSOnvIL., April 28, 1643.
Mr Dsana Sam:-Whn the interests of
the south are in danger, one naturailly
turn's one's eyes to you who have so long
proved yourself to fie their vigilant, able
and devoted guardian. It seems to me
that the impending crisis is fraught with
as much ad serious mischiefs, ai, could
easily be brought to boar on the prosperity
of any people. A fanatical war waged
against our two great staples. A ith a vin
dictive energy on both bides of ite ocean,
that las rarely been eqeaulled. should ad
monish us to husband oar resource, at ill
events to avoid the danger of division.
The cotton and the sugar planter fiat a
common property to defend against the
machinations of an artful, sagaeoti anod
bold enemy. Under the guise of philai
thropy. he seeks to ds-prive us of that kind
of labor, which he contributed iore thai:
any other to plant on our soil, sind which
long habit, the character of our climate
and productions have retdered neceesiary
tons.
- But they have too mnuch art -to at tempt
by v1olence and openly, what his cuiniing
and knowledge has taught him tray, if he
can deceive us, more effectually be accomI
plished by indirectios. If our productions
can be rendered uuprofitablo. hi object.
lIe sees, will be accomplished Should
the slave holler be also brought into the
disrepute, hsis hole pturpoe ill be fully
a~tained. A disreptabule and untprotltable
cnlhure be knows will necessarily be abain
dloned.
To this end have the British Sugaer Is
lands been destroyed. and sihat prodttet
sought to hbe transferred to thte ur're genial
climate of India. ilensc, alto, the great
ellrirs so draw their suppliesa of cottu
fron the same regiott. ht wousldt seem to
me questionable whbether a plenstiful aend
cheap supply of sugar cat he drawn from
thenace, aod still tmosre ss as to cuottn. The
China war has givens, is ise true, to the cot
toni esperiment an apparent success ; hut
this, probably, does not belong to it. A
rapid increase in the pruoduction of sugatr
in China and eisewbere,' has presented
the eflects of the destrutions of the Britishs
Islands, from being a.' yet fully lef. But
'this wili soon be expersenced, by the sup
pression of the slave trade, ehfectually
checking any further extension. evens if is
do not diminish the prodluct. The sugar
interest may. and probablyt will be pros
perons if not sacrificed by its own~s govern
ment in the puending adjustment of the
Tarif.~
&Sgar gaowers ere large consum'ters of
most of the articles of nanaufacture and
prodnetion wbich the duty will fall, ande
if they do nest obatain a correspondhing duty
on their product when iumported, it is teir
settleud conviction thsat this bransch of
Southern agriculture mtust be abaniduned.
You know that this culture was not forced',
into existence by a protective TarifF That!
it does not owe its being to any forced or
fase system, but was cherished by a duty
thsat was pturely a revenue one. Sugar
has been a very fruitful source of revenue
to the governrnemt, alhbough the duty nepver
bas been a very heavy or onerou., one.
Having grown up by theside of the wants
of the Treasury, it would seem hard,- that
this interest should be absandoned to its
fiats, whilst others, that sprang out of the
false system of an avowedly protective
Tarif, should continue to receive ample
protection. I confess I never was an adl
vocate, I never can be. of a protective
Tarif, as such; but have never been able
to yield such incidental protection to the
great interests of the country, as coulId
fairly and honestly be given. Bunt as ours
is an agricultural and Southern interest,
unaided by active agents, and having
nothing to etnlist the sympathies of the
Tariff side of the house, 're naust he sacri
ficed, unless those who are in principle
and habit anti-Tariff, will see shat equal
justice be done in.
Stong us your feelings and principles
have always been against the protective
pole,"i do not thtink that you have ever
cootzaded that fair incidental proction
was esther inexpsedient oir adverse to any
sound principte. But even if you were,
you cimuld not, I think, fail to perceive
.that when such favors were being dis
pensed, the South would be entitled to a

sow so employed, must necessarily be
sinployed in cultivating cotton; promising
esults on the price of that article, much
nore immediate as well as permanent than
he culture in ladia. We make on an
inerage 100,000 lhhb of sugar; it is fair
0 say. that not more than from three to
four hogsheads per hantl are made. A hi-h

at say about 30.000. This force employed
on the rich lands of the Mississippi. would
produce frorn 150 to 200.000 bales. As
ihe Increase of all the negroes, not only
those employed it cotton, but in all the
slave holdipg States, would then exclu
sively be thrown on that eraip. you will
see how rapidly the culture would be ex -
tended, as well as hlow certainly the pro
duction would overtake thoctreme point

To me it seems equally certain, thnt if'

of a very heavy tarill. But, even, if the

MISCE LLANEOUS.
Nzw YomK. June 15.
The Irish )lrpeat Motenent in this
Country,-Rlavons of the United States
with England and Europe.-We give in
this day's paper, a full and accurate re
port of th- first greal public meeting of the
Iriah an. A merican Repealerm, which look
place yesterday afternoun ins the Park of
New York, with the City liall .Ot one
sile, and on the other the great Croton
Fountain, springing sixty feet up to hea
veil.
This meeting, in all its bestrings and as
pects, may be conailered one of the great
est poptilar novetents that ever took
place ini this cotanry, having a tendency
to excite the people of Europe, and to
breed revolutions across the water. It
islist not hie considlered as an isolated
movement of a few Irish emigrants in this
contiry, sympathising with their native
land-it is the beginning o a general out
break ;-a popular enthusiasm-iti favor,
not only of revolution in Ireland-but of:
revolution throughout Europe. In this
mivement on this continent, all parties
and all classes partake. with ili excepliona
of the government who have Iretslies to
observe-and of the conimercial clsses.
A ho tare bound by the ties of interest to the
present state of things iu Europe. We
see men occupying the highest political
and local positio-n rilready enrolled in the
movetmoeut-including the son of the Pre
sidient. memberv of Congrex, etx-meubers
(of Congres-and State and nlinscipal
oflicer of Lvery crate.
'lhere is no mistake in the meaning and I
purpose of the agitation in this country,
" hatever shape it may take in Ireland, in
England. or elsew here. In this country
fthe anitators mean revolution--not burren
lexi-dative repeal-an overturning of ex
istig goveinments-and the establish
ient of popular instittilons throughout
I-urope. New York is the centre of this
revoltlionary movement-and from this
point their purposes will lie best explained

form ana important iiem in the rapidly
growing commerce of this cty. To illut
trait' the extent of this branch of aur trade
we have made a small calculation which
will he found to be entirely correct.
During the last week in blay there was
sent from Buffalo via the canal, sixty-one
thousand and nitety-seven barrels'of Dour
anwl sixty-eight thousand six hundred and
fifty-six busie;s of wheat. Allowing each
bushel of the latter to make forxy-fve
pounds of flour, and each barrel of the
former to contain one hundred and ninety
six pounds,. the total of pounds wasffleen
millions sixty-four thousand five hundred
and thirty-lawa! During the same period
th--re %sas sent freom this city along with
this immense quantity of flour thirteen
iaundred and forty right thousand tao hun
dred and thirteen pounds of butter and
lard. There was also sent over two and
a luartcr millions of pounds of pearlash
and other ashes. Now, if the good people
ou the road -*ill furnish proper "wetting"
and the place to bake it in, we will put
two pounds of good flaur in each foot of
cake, and lard.butter and salawratus enough
to match, and treat them with a contino
ons Short Cake fourteen hundred tawenty
six thousand miles and one hundred and
eighty rods long.
One end of this cake might be placed in
the capital of Missouri, and the other
would rect only reach to Boston, but it
would "stiek out" over the Atlantic some
two hundred miles. Of this all the peo
pile of the United States might eat otdd be
tilled without a miracle, besides giving
the sh of the great deep a "glorius nib
ble."
As an addenda to the above, it will be
seen that within the last twenty-four hours
tl'ere have arrived iu port, over 25,000
!, irrels of ITour, and 33,000 bushels of
wheat and other articles in proportion.

Comminutee of A rrawgemas
UJ~ We call the attention of our readers to
thre adveraising columms of this day's paper,
whlicha they wsill find very int.:resting.
U~i We are informed by a gentleman, wh~ose
plaitinrg interest is in the neighborhood of
Camnbridge, that the insecrt called the Chinch
Bug. had mtade its appearance on his planta
ion. It was first dircovered on a few volunteer
stalks of' cortn, oii the border of a wheat field,
that tead been reaped oanly a few days, thes stub
tale of a hich hada become dry mod afforded no
ieatrishmenit for them. U'pon examainationa
liey were found to be on the wheat, os, and
~orn, but not in great numabers, and had es yet
Junec but little dnusage.
The Crops-Ont our late visit to Chiarlesrton,
re were nauch gr..tified at the appearance of
heo crop) throngha the section ofeotantry which
ce passed. The Wheat crop was being gath
ited, anid froma whantwe could learn from s~sueo
>fthe olest farmers., is the largest crop of this
rain gatirere~d t'or a nuuaber of years. The
Jat crop, whaich we feared would have been
haert, hea turned out remarkably well. The
orun has a hreathy apnaear.inee, and, barriing
ccidemts. we shall. nao doubt, have good grain
rop'.. Cottuen is not qutite as good as usual,
in account of the latenes'.s oif planting.
