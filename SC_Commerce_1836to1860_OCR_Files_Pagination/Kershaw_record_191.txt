8ERGEANTJASPER.
The following account of this dauntless
patriot soldier, we copy from the44 Charles-1
ton Mercury " The deed of noble daring
recorded below, has long been familiar to
ua. On the anniversaries of the 28th of
Juoer and the 4th of July, the sons of
Carolina, in their flowing cops, ever freshly
remember him. An attempt is going
to be made to get a pension for his daughter,
who is living, and in want. For the
uonor ?i our country, let it not prove unsuccessful,
"William Jasper emigrated at an early
age from Ireland, and settled and married
in one of the ii\teror districts of S Carolina,
previone to the Revolution. Imbued
with a national hatred of tyrants, he naturally
embraced with ardor the cause of
the Revolution and was among the first
who took up arflra and joined the troops
which Carolina marshalled at Fort Moultrie
for the defence of the harbor of
Charleston. Upon the memorable 28th
of June, 1776, and when the fire upon
iL. I . iL. 1? i .?a. a I? xi * xr*
nc iuk was iiic uuuesi, me uug-sian was
struck down by a cannon ball, and the
colors, precipitated with it over the walls
of the fort. Dismay struck consternation
into the hearts of the assembled citizens,
who, from the wharves of the city, witnessed
the fight, for they thought for a
moment that it was lost; but the gallant
Jasper was seen rushing over the ramparts
?he recovered the colors?he mounts
the perilous height?he turns?waves the
colors in the face of the enemy, and hurraing
and shouting 44 God save liberty and
my country!" fixed them in their position
and resumed his place at the guns.
Heroism like this excited a corresponding
enthusiam; the next day Governor
Rutledge visited the slaughter pen, called
for Jasper, and offered him a commission.
44 No, sir! I am more at home, and can
be more useful as I am.*'
44 Noble Jasperl accept then this sword,"

Often did he make it drink the best blood
of the enemy. He was a powerful man,
strong active, intelligent, and of the most
fearless courage; eminent in partisan warefare,
ever hovering around the skirts of
Royalists, he struck them many a terrible
blow, and carried off many a precious
prize. Implicit confidence was placed in
him by the American officers, and he was
allowed to pirk a few daring spirits like
his own, and go and come when and
where he pleased- {Scarcely was a battle
fought in the South' between '76 and 79
without the aid of the Sergeant, and many
acts as daring as that of the celebrated
Rescueare told by fond tradition.
Thus he went on, proving the wisdom of
those institutions that have made America
the terror of the oppressors, as well as
the asylum of the oppressed, until the
period of the disastrous attack of the
combined French und American arms to
dislodge the British from Savannah, on
the 9th of October, 1779. It was unsuccessful.
The colors of the regiment to
which Jasper belonged uere presented to
it, with a special charge from ifie noble
donor, Mrs. Elliott to Jasper, to "guard
them well." Those colors were successively
borne by Lieutenants Bushe and
Hume upon thai fatal day, and both were
killed, Jasper was resolved that they
should not fall into the hands of the enemy,
and made a prodiguous effort to carry
them off In that desperate act he was
mortally wounded, and there closed his
- .btilliant career. Thus has this gallant
"soldier, though serving in the ranks,
renown and on historical name,

After t few days he commences busU
nets for himself. His oalv capital is* a
good name and business talents. These
goide him to wealth. lit a few years he
is found one of the most 6]pulent and influential
merchants in the city. And the
country boy who comes into Washington
street, as he did, in search of a fortune,
now looks up to him with reverence, as
one of the noblest of the land.
I / This is the*history of many of the first
merchants of Boston and New York.
These poor country boys with the virtues
which are nurtured in an economical home,
come into our great cities and take the
lead in law, in politics, in merchandize.
There are exceptions but this is the general
rule in all the principal cities in this
country and in England. What is the
subsequent history?
The sons and daughters of this new
rich man, find a very different cradle from
that which their father found in his paternal
home. Profusion and splendor are
all arotfnd them. Their father trod a
painted floor, or perhaps ate his bread
and milk from an earthern bowl or the tin
dipper. They move in apartments furnished
with splendour, take their coffee
from cups of silver, lam not saying that
1 this is wrong, but simply describing the <
I process which I apprehend is general, i
Under these influences they have many
imaginary wants, and the profusion around
them destroys all habits of economy.?
The sons feel that tlicy are not dependent
upon their own exertions f >r support; that
their father is rich; that he will set them
op in business, and they think that properly
will flow in upon them as easily as
it follows the well directed efforts of their I
father's strong mind. They form no habits
of close application. They have received
no instructions in the hard but
useful school of adversity. The father
has felt that in amassing propertv he was
promoting the welfare of his family. He(

wouia dc ncn, anu ne lias laueu a snare.
The father dies. The property i8 divided.
The sons are in business, their habits
are such that they cannot avoid heavy
expenditures, and they cannot endure the
rigor or unwearied exertion. Their father
commenced at the bottom of the ladder
and gradually ascended. He came
from the farm house, and rose by degrees
to opulence and luxury. The sons commenced
at the lop of the ladder and go
down. Year after year the property
dwindles away, and the children arc soon
fairly down in the walks of obscurity and
poverty. The son of the coachman and
his master change places. The one with
his wife and children on the inside seat,
and the other with whip and rein mounts
the box. It is thus the wheel is continually
revolving. And this is not through the
caprices of blind fortune, but through
the operation of clearly defined and natural
muses.
Now here is the snare in which he falls
who will be rich, lie may be laboring
all his life for the accumulation of property,
and that very property be the cause of
the ruin of his family. The exposure of
the (laughters happiness may he still greater
than that of the sons. When an affectionate
hearted lady awakes to the consciousness
that her husband has taken her
hut as the necessary encumbrance to her
father's property, the measure of liei
' wretchedness is almost full. The danger
of an unhappy marriage is under ail circumstances
great. Even \yhen there is
no allurement to the connection, but coogeniality
of tasts and affection, the number
of ill sorted anil discordant unions is
fearfully great. Hut chances of happiness
which a young lady with an independent
fortune has are very small indeed.- The
very fuel that she has moneywill be regarded
as an objection by many of the
best names and heaits, while the frivolous
and the heartless and profligate will dock
around her. An ingenious young man
shrinks from the imputation of marrying
her for money, and he fears to take as
a companion through life's hard pilgrimage
one who has been nurtured in fashion
and luxury. Thus does a man not unfreqtientiy
labor for his whole life to accumulate
property which ruins his sons and
daughters. lie neglects God, gives himself

On the 19th at night, there was a dreadful

of an immense flock of land birds, which 1
completely covered the deck, and seemed 1

The passengers and crew caught over a 1
100 of them, and they consisted chiefly 1
of the nimble little brown sparrow which I
is seeu twitteriug on all the eaves in Europe.
Also, there were three beautiful 1
black birds speckled with while spots and 1
ruby colored necks; there was also a so- 1
litary snipe. No doubt these feathered 1
visitors, wandering about for some new re- j
sidence in the severe winter which has pas- '
sed in Europe, were caught in some vjolent
gale and borne unconsciously to sea,
where they vainly sought refuge on the
ship's deck, which proved any thing pro- 1

ECONOMY OF FODDEK. 1
BY REV. II. COLMAN.
Let us compare the value of hay with j
other crops for the feeding of stock. An '
acre of hay yields one ton and a half of 1
vegetable food; an acre of carrots or 1
Swedish turnips will yield from ten t?J' *
twenty tons, say fifteen tons, which is b) '
no means an exaggerated estimate. Crops 1
at the rale of twenty-five tons of carrots 1
and twenty-two of Swedish turnips to the I
acre, have been raised among us, and '
much larger than these are upon record. I
By an experiment it has been ascertain- 1
ed that three working horses fifteen and a'1
half hands high consumed at the rate of 1
two hundred and twenty-four pounds of 1
hay per week, or five tons one thousand I
five hundred and forty-eight pounds of buy
per year, besides, twelve gallons of oats
each per week, or seventy-eight bushels I
by the year. An unworked horse con* '
sutned at the rate of four and one quarter '
tons of hay by the year. The produce
therefore of nearly six acres of land in
this mode of feeding, is necessary to sup-1
port a working horse by the year; but half J
an acre 01 carrots at ouu bushels to the
acre, with the addition of chopped straw,
will, while the season for their use lasts,
do it as well, if not better. These things
do not admit of doubt; they have been
subjects of accurate tiial.
It is believed, that the value of a bushel
of Indian corn in straw and meal, wilt
keep a healthy horse in good condition
for work a week. An acre of Indian corn,
which yields sixty bushels will be ample
for the support of a horse through the
year. Now it is for the farmer to consider,
whether it be better to maintain his
horse upon the produce of half an acre
of carrots, which can be cultivated at an
expense not graatly exceeding the ex
x. 1 1 / - e - -
peuse 01 nan an acre 01 potatoes; or upon
half an acre of rtiia baga, which can he
raised as a second crop at less expense
than potatoes; or upon the grain produce
of an acre of Indian corn; or on the other
hand, upon the produce of six acres in hay
and grain, for six acres will hardly do
more than to yield heftrly six tons of hay
and seventy or eighty bushels of oats.?
The same economy might be as success
fully introduced into the feeding of our
neat cattle. I have known a yoke of
f xen engaged in the labor of a farm, to
be kept three months in winter, in good
wooking condition, upon one bushel of
Indian meal, and about twenty-five cents
worth of straw per week; and my own
team was never in better condition for ap- i
pearance and lubor, than when fed wholiy 1
upon a liberal supply of rula baga and I
the coarsest fodder. But it has been as- (
cerlained by accurate measurement, that
an unworked ox put up on good old liay, i
consumed at the rate of 33lbs. per day, I
or 23Ilbs. per wepk, which is upwards of |
six tons per year of 2000lbs. to the ton. J
There must then be a great saving between 1
feeding in the wav referred to or upon <
English hay; and fenglish hay alone, in 1
any quantity, without grain or vegetables i
is not sufficient for any hard working ani- I
mal. t
SOAKING CORN TO FEED HORSES. 1

MR. DIDDLE*
We think the Globe and other Democratic
papers only show their want of decency
by complaining of the great /Enoncial
operations of Mr. Biddle. Having
his name up, as a great financier, that
gentleman may now do as he listeth.? j
This seems to be a well settled point, so
far as the refined and intellectual^portion j
of the people are concerned?and who in
the deuce cares about the thoughts, opinions.
the nrpimlirPA Itr thn naatinn,
the feelings, or the interests, of the rough,
motley mass of what are termed ordinary
people? Mr. Biddle is making money. If
he heretofore lost millions in his wellfought
political battles, he is now in a
fair way to make up f >r late expenditures
and be ready to advance a few millions to
aid his friends in the next political campaign.
That he is a bold financier, is
proved by the free use lie makes of the
notes of the late Bank of the U. States
without authority of the law and in contempt
of every principle of moral right;
that lie is skilful is demonstrated by his
successful opposition to a general resumption
of specie payments.
"We can tell the Editors of the Globe
that Mr. Biddle is a great man; a great
financier; a leading and controlling statesman;
and that is not all. He is the most
adroit screw-driver living. By putting
liis grappling irons on the old notes of
the late Bank he has been enabled to weild
millions effectively, which have 110 legal
or real existence, and thus causes thoumuds
to look up to and adore him. Thus,
oo, he doubles his effective capital; and,
is a necessary consequence, doubles his
lower, both in and out of Congress. He |
understands tire principle, that money is
power, and acts on it?so judiciously and
energetically, that many of the public
men of the nution dare not say their souls 1
are their own, and ihe great Whig party
are kept in such a position thai they must
go for Mr. Biddle's bank or no bank at
all.
Thus Mr. Biddle grasps and wields
power. Thus he rules the Whig politicians
and the Whig banks. And, we j
hazzard but little in saying, should he have
his way for three years to come, he will
be able to rule the whole country with
44 the utmost ease and precision." The
British stockholders of the bank of the
United States admire Mr. Biddle more
than ever. With an invisible razor, he
is shaving the country to the quick, whilst
he is holding it in a position that will enable
him to continue to shave it; and, at
the same time, he extort nraise from all
I "
the decency for Ids liberality, when they
should really be admiring his dexterity.
Now to the point: Mr. Biddle not only
commands the banks, Congress and many
of the State Legislatures, but he has tuken
charge of the cotton crop of the country,
and commenced regulating foreign and
domestic exchanges. And the way he
operates "is a sin to Crockett." It is
astonishing his financiering and merchandising
are not admired by the Globe
whilst all the decent Whig papers arc
lauding both with all their might and all
their souls. Ye gods! how sleek he cuts,
and how deep too!
At this moment Mr. .Biddle is pouring
out the "old notes" freely again. 11c has |
agents now advertising in Cincinnatti, St.
Louis, Louisville, and almost every where
else, for the notes of the cotton growing
States, which he purchases at ten or fifteen
per cent discount with the 44 old;
notes. The Southern motley is sent
home (to the South,) and invested in cotton.
There, the banka that keep accounts
with the great Mr. Biddle are authorized
to sell exchanges on the North?
to draw on Mr. Riddl<??unit in ">ceiio
payments for the bills, in Southern money
at ten or twelve per cent, discount?the
profits on the bills being invested in more
cotton.
Thus the financier makes, on an average,
ten per cent, in the purchase of
Southern funds, and an excess over ten
per cent, in the sale of exchange 011 the
North sufficient .to pay commissions?
leaving a clear gain of twenty per cent.
?n forty days* use of the old notes."? 1
Every live millions oi "old notes" are i
nade good, by this mode of operation, |
"of cotton to the amount of six millions, l
ind to prevent his business from being in- i
ured, he forces the bunks of Tennessee, i

iciently debased to eualle him to use it

RESOLUTIONS QF THE LATE COMMERCIAL
CONVENTION AT AUGUSTA.
1. Resolved, That adirect trade is the
natural channel of communication between
nations, which oflft.to eachjother
the best market for their mutual productions;
and that the iutervention of a third
party must operate as a tax upon the exchanges
between them; *
2. Resolved, That the Southern and
South-western States of this Union aflord
those staples with which arc purchased
nearly the whole foreign imports of the
country; that they are tlie consumers of a
large portion of these imports, ami ought
naturally themselves to furnish the clian*
ncl through which the exchange is made;
that Jon no occasion have their citizens
been found incapable of maintaining*
themselves in fair competition with other
sections; and that the diversion of their
trade from its natural channels, must have
been brought about by the unequal action
of the federal government, or by the abstraction
of our people towards oilier pur- .
suits
3. Resolved, That in the opinion of
this Convention such a state of things
should no longer continue; that the present
condition of the commercial relations
of the country, and the disruption of the
existing channels of trade, afford an opportunity
of breaking down the trammels
which have so long fettered our commerce,
and of restoring to the South its
natural advantages; and that it is incumbent
upon euery man who has at heart the
good of his country, to lend his best exertions
to the promotion ot these objects
and to establish our trade upon a sound
and permanent basis.
4. Resolved, That this Convention is
fully aware of thfc diflicultios to l c overcome
in the prosecution of their enterprise;
but nothing daunted thereby, and
fully relying upon the ptiblic spirit and
zealous co-operation of their fellow citizens,
they are determined to advance
with untiring perscveranc<; and with that
vciw, do earnestly recommend the adoption
of the following measures.
1. That an effort should he made to afford
tx> the importers and purchasers at
Southern seaports, the same facilities
which aac offered elsewhere; and with this
view it is recommended that the Banks in
the seaports should immediately apply a
I portion of their respective capitals, to the
purchase of foreign exchange, and to the
procurement of credits or funds in Europe;
and that they should afford the same to
the importing merchants upon a discount
or collateral pledge of such good paper us
he may take take from the merchants of
the interior, and that this accommodation
be afforded as well upon paper having
more than six months lo run, as upon that
having less; and that the Banks ol the interior
co-operate by collecting and remitting
the proceeds of such paper to the
banks on the sea const; that they maintain
the credit of their bills, and keep down
the exchanges by redeeming their own
paper at the seaports; and that on the other
hand the banks in the Southern Atlantic
cities make arrangements bv which the
D ?
notes of all of them shall be at par iu
each.
| i nat with a view to the important
I subjects of equalizing the exchanges l>c|
twern Southern and South-western Slates
i and Territories, this Convention earnestly
! recommend to the various Banks of the
principal cities of those States, or such as
j inay be conveniently located, to receive
the bills of each other in their general
busiuess, and tp adopt such arrangements
for settlements, at short periods, as they
may deem suitable and proper; the Banks
against whom the balance should fall, to
furnish .funds for the settlement of the ?
same, or to pay an interest of six per cent
from the period of settlement, and that a
committee of live be appointed to take
such measures as, in their judgement, will
carry fully into effect the preceding recommendations.
3, That the Merchants of the South
and South-West, be earnestly recommended
to give preference to the importers
in their own markets, and that they afford
them an opportunity of fair competition
with other sections, by making their first
calls for purchases at Southern and Southwestern
seaports; and on the other hand,
that the Merchants at the sea-ports shall,
forthwith, set about importing such stocks
of goods, as will ensure, at fair rates, a
supply to the demand from the merchants
of the interior.
