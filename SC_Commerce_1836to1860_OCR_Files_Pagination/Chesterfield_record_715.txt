For the few last weeks our notice of the state
of the river was that it was " navigable for pole
boats with light freights." Bat it so happened I
tteice that a few days after the appearance of our
paper with this notice, and before the river had
risen, the steamer Utility came up to the landing
with her two tow boats well laden, as we under- ;
stand. The error we ascribe rather to the boat !
than to ourselves. She seems, somehow, to slip
along in a depth of water that used to be sufficient

Mr. Spencer, Secretary of War. having been re- !
- " *
guested by a committee of the friends of the President
in Rochester, N. Y., to extend to that town
a vu?It which he had made to the State, and ad.
drew a public meeting in explanation and defence
of the course of the present administration, or, if
ho would not do that, to address them a communi.
cation on the same subject, he chose tho latter
course. The communication has been published,
but wc received it too late to be either inserted, |,
or noticed at any length in this week's paper. It
is a regular and zealous defence of the President,
and an attack upon Mr. Clay. Its tone is proof of
how little reliance is to be placed on the oft repealed
statements of letter writers at Washington, '
that Mr. Spencer was about to resign or to be '
^ dismissed on account of his differences from the ;
President.
The Hon. William Ukia.m, of Montpelicr, has J
been' chosen Senator from Vermont for six years |
from the 4th of March next.
At a convention in the Congressional District of |
Massachusetts represented by Mr. Cushing, nssem- '
hied to nominate a candidate for Congress, Mr. i
Cushing was chosen on the second ballot. Oneof his
. . . I
friends immediately announced tint Mr. Cushing j
declined the nomination, and anotiier person was
then chosen. Letter writers stats that .Mr. Ci.s'iing
would not bare been nominated at all by the
Convention had it not been previously understood
that he would decline. If this be so, (which is
very questionable,) it k much more discreditable
to the convention than to Mr. Cushing. Tl?e only
reason why he eotihl wish a nomination when
he intended not to be a candidate, must have been
to obtain from his constituents some expression of
their approbation of his past course in Congress.
Now if they did not approve it, to say they did,
was unmanly as well as dishonest; and was at
the same time a high personal compliment to Mr.
Cushing.
Monrok Edwards has been sentenced to con.
fincmcnt in the N. Y. Pcnetcntiary for the two <
terms of five years each. It seems to be getting |
fashionable for vile and hardened villains to be i
impertinent to the court in New York, when about .
to pass sentence on them. We extract the following
from the report of the proceedings, in the
N. Y. Commercial Advertiser;
\I have heard the opinion your honor has expressed
of my guilt in private. I am not a fool ?
my enemies never said that of me. You may
therefore spare the usual accompanying remarks, <
as they will ot?<y have an effect contrary to that j
intended.
' *' If I were guilty I would not be insensible of the i
enormity of my crime, and not all the learning i
J and wisdom of the world could make mc feel it
jnore keenly. I am not more callous than others.
My situation is sufficiently piinful withou adding
r.MH ,rL-a frt ni.lljp it more SO."
-"7 ,w? ; ,
The prisoner remained standing, when Judge
Kent said he had intended to piss the sentence
without adding ono word, and should now do so
but for some of the prisoner's remarks.
He said the prisoner's defence had been as extraordinary
as his guilt, of which no human being who
had heard the evidence could doubt.
He spoke of the attempt at subornation of perjury,
particularly that on the last trial.
[Edwards interrupted the Judge by saying, he
cared not for the opinion of the world.]
The judge remarked that there was nothing extraordinary
in his case, save the enormity of his
guilt. He added that all remarks would be useless, j
Ho had no hope for him. - He had but a faint j '
hope that his confinement of ten years would have j '
the effect of making him what he never had been,
an honorable and respectable member of society. 1
f" Quite complimentary," muttered Edwards]
He remarked to the prisoner that he had nev- 1
| I
cr known one who throughout his life had been '
more destitute of moral principles.
He then said that he should sentence him for
th? longest term the law would allow.
(- I do'nt want any less," said the prisoner.]
* 44 -You shall be gratified in that respect," returned.
the judge, and I regret that the law dots not
affix a severer penalty to offences so enormous."
He then sentenced him to the state prison for '
fiva years on each indictment. The prisoner 1
beard the sentence with a smile, and left the room
apparently in high glee.
[The offences of which he was convicted were j
forgeries.]

The United States Senate.?The New York
Evening Post says, a new Senator from each of
eighteen State9, will take his scat in the next Con.
gross. Nine of them will 6end Democratic members
as heretofore, viz: Maine, New Hampshire,
Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Alabama, O-1
hio, Illinois, 4and Missouri. Three other States j
will send Whig members as heretofore, viz : Ver.
mont, New Jersey, and Kentucky. Four States
will send Democratic members, that have been
heretofore represented by Whigs, viz : Maryland,
North Carolina, South Carolina, and Indiana.?
There are two States yet that we have not mentinned,
apart from Tennessee. These are New J
York and Louisiana. In the former the Legis. 1
lature is yet to be chosen, though there can be no |
doubt of its character, and as to the latter it may
be set off against New York in this estimate.?
This makes a tie in the Senate. What course
will be adopted in Tennessee, remains to be seen.

The Nashville Banner states that immense sacrifices
of property are almost daily made in Middle
Tennessee. It says:
" We will mention, by way of example, that
on Saturday last, eleven large likely mules, two
new wagons, costing ?150 apiece, and a negro
man, middle aged and likely, were sold in Frank- j
lin, at sheriffs sale, and in the aggregate brought
but ?500.
Trade in New York.?The New York Express
says:?44 Here there is the same languor
there has been in all business matters. Our fall
season has come, and nearly gone, yet but little
business has been transacted. There is a general
complaint on the part of all classes that they have
had but a very small business. Dry goods, of every
kind and description, arc selling at most ruin-!
ou6 prices. The country merchants have bought J
but very sparingly, and even that has amounted
to a very small sum: It is very obvious that the
farmer, at the present rate of produce, can realize
but a very poor return for his labor."

We observe that the brilliant success of the De- i

issue a prospectus of a Whig Journal, to be called :

Coi.t's Si'B-Makine Batterv.?Yesterday after- i
noon, at 1 o'clock, the Battery was thronged with
an immense crowd of spectators, waiting to sec '
the result of the trial of Colt's sub-marinc appara- j
tus. Castle Garden also, was tilled with spccta- !
tors, and numbers put oil* from the shore in boats,1
to observe tiic result of the experiment. The ves-,
sel to be blown up, lay moored in the stream, about
a hundred }*ards from Castle Garden. She was
a brig of about 330 tons. Her masts were stand-!
ing, as high as the topmast; but, with the exeep-1
tion of a few ropes to serve as stays, all her rig- ;
ging was taken off. Colt, the operator, stood up. j
on Governor's Island, from which wires extended }
to the powder beneath the vessel, a distance of
half a mile. The signal concerted was the firing j
of three guns, one after the other, from the North i
Carolina; the two first as alarm guns, and the
last as v signal. The third gun was no sooner j
fired, than instantaneously ajmost, the electricity J
was communicated through the wires to the sub- |
marine magazine, which exploded, throwing up j
the vessel in fragments, scon with difficulty here j
and there through an immense mass of water and i
smoke. The water was thrown in a column to
the height of nearly 100 feet. When the agitation
subsided, nothing was seen of the vessel, save in
the form of pieces of boards, heavy masses of timber,
and a portion of her hull.
The result of the trial was highly satisfactory, j
and a loud shout from the multitude on shore, tcs-!
titled their approbation. There is no doubt that this j
apparatus can be used with effect upon a hos'ile
t-r wsr.l hWLndirvr .i harbor. The force of the ex.
dosion was prodigious, as was shown by the sudden ' (
raising of such a mass of water to such a height, J
ind by the total dispersion of the timbers of the j I
vessel. As a winding up to the whole, numerous j

american sheet iron.
The article of sheet iron is bo general and im- t
portant in its uses, that any improvement in it* ?
manufacture is of interest to every body, and it is
with much pleasure that we have an improve. <
nient to notice, extraordinary in its kind. The
best qualities of sheet iron have always been brought
from the shops of Russia. Neither England, Swe- '
dm, nor any of the European iron.manufacturing 'J
countries have been able to acquire the secret of -f
its beauty of finish, color, or fineness, or to pro- I
ducc any thing like, it, although every effort of *
of skill and science has been exhausted to attain f
that object.
Wc have many spcriinens of sheet iron made t
by the Messrs. Wood, of the Juniata iron works, t
Pennsylvania, which imitates very nearly the
Russian article, both in color and beauty of finish. *.
The sheets had the spring or warp of the Ameri<
jn rolled sheet, and on being worked were found '
to have the usual attributes of good American t
iron, that is, it worked better across the grain *
than with the grain, in turning seams. Of <
course, it being rolled, left the fibres lengthways of <
the sheet, a defect which may be overcome, now f
that the secret of the polish and color is obtained. ! i
Wc saw two or three articles made from it at the "
stove and furniture store of Rosebooin A. Co. in J
Market street, which compared well with that of J
the Russian material. fc
The perfection of this article by our country. ^
men will be an invaluable acquisition to the re. <
sources and wealth of the nation, and wc hail this 1
as the sure precursor of that perfection.?N. Y. f

Texas and Mexico.?By the Natchitoches
Herald we learn that the mediation
of the United States has been offered
by this Government, in the hope of
bringing about a reconciliation between
Texas and Mexico. It appears that Mr.
Webster, by instruction of tho President,
has addressed a letter to the American
Minister at Austin, enclosing n copy of
Instructions which had already been for

warded to i>ir. i nompson ui ?i? i

may be deemed tc comport tv:th the interest
of the Texian Government to suspend
my offensive military operation which
may be in contemplation again?t the
Mexican Republic until it should learn
the result of (he negotiation which Mr.
Thompson had been directed to undertake."
This, though not officially communicfl'
ted, yet comes in such a shape as entitles
it to credit. Mr. Webster is represented
to say to the Mexican authorities, 44 that
while his Government sees with pain the
prospect of active warlike preparations
between Texasand Mexico, and disclaims
ill right to interfere, yet it cannot, under i
the circumstances, be indifferent to n renewal
of hostilities between them. The
general and natural advantages of peace,
the security of our commerce, -the uncertainty
of the issue of war, (he dissimilarifyofthe
people, and the extent of terri
lory of the two countries, are all uigod as
ronsons to accept the proffered mediation. J
To theso is added the intimation that, in
:nse ef war, American citizens will cmi- 1
grate hence and aid the Tcxians, and thnt !
t is the President's conviction that war is 1
lot only useless but hopeless. '

local accompaniment of a want experienced
by the whole frame, and perceived (
by the nervous system. Local npplica- \
lions, accordingly, go but a short way in
giving relief, while the introduction of flu- j
ids by any other channel?by immersion
in a bath, by injection into the veins, or 1
through an external opening into the
stomach?is sufficient to quench thirst
without the liquid over touching the throat.
The affection of that part, therefore, is
merely a result of the state of the system,
and not itself thecnusc of thirst.
Thirst, or a desire for liquids, is experienced
in its greatest intensity whon the
accretion and exhalation of the animal
fluids is most active; and it is consequently
most urgent in summer, in warm cli- ,
nates, and in persons engaged in severe
)xer(ion, particularly if exposed at the 1
?ame time to a heated atmosphere.?
Blacksmiths, glassblowers, engineers, and
others, whose employment exposes thoin <
o heat of furnaces, and in whom perspirafion
is excessive, are accordingly almost!
ronstantly under the influence of thirst ; 1
whereas those who ore employed in pro-'
fessions requiring only moderate exertion i
tn a temperate atmosphere, und in whom 1
the fluid secretions are very moderate,'
rnrelv exocrioncc the sensation in an ur- J
J I
gent degree.
Thirst varies in intensity nlso according
lo the nature of the fond. If the diet bo
lot and stimulating, such as results from
1 free admixture of spices or salt, the dc
iire for drink is grentlv increased. The
same thing happens if the food l)G ofsdfV
ind solid nature. The purpose of the in:rcascd
thirst in the former circumstance, I
s manifestly to dilute and diminish the
excess of stimulant, nnd I hereby prevent
he injury which it would otherwise inflict.
The same principle explains the thirst ex- f
>erienced by those who drink too much i
vine. In instances of this kind, I have 1
leard great thirst in the evening and du- r
ing the night complained of as habitual, ,
vithout the person even suspecting that t
t was owing to the wine; nnd yet, on)
ibstaining from the latter, the thirst very j
oon disappeared. ?
Continued thirst, it is well known, is t
nuch more intolerable than continued i
mnger. The mass of circulating fluid c
O j
n the body is very great, and, as the vaious
excretions consist chiefly of fluid 1 r
natter, it necessarily happens, that when i
hese have been eliminated for a consider- s
hie time without any liquid being recoivd
into the system, the proportion of solid t
natter in the body becomes unduly large.
The blood, consequently, becomes thick
r, and changed in quality, nnd much f^ore
rritating than it is in its natural atato.?
['he craving of thirst is th^s generally
endered more urgent and overpowering
han that of hunger.
In Astatic Cholera, the watery portion
f the blood, on which its fluidity depends, p
s drained otr with rapidity; aid llio reult
is, in the first place, nil nluiost com- C
ileic stoppage of the circuiatiun, and, in j'
he second, a constant craving for drink v
o supply the place of the lost serum,
vhich consists chiefly of water, holding
ome of the alkaline salts in solution, ?
Phis circumstance explains, in somo do;ree,
the extraordinary effects which have
teen produced, even in the worst stages j
if the disease, when life seemed almost 1
ixtinct, by injecting large quantities of 3
aline solutions into the veins. Patients 1
ipparcntlv on the ver^e of existence, cold,
uilscless, and inanimatef have, in the'
course of a few minutes, been enabled hy
this moans to sit up in bed, and to exhibit
all signs of restored strength and health.
I'lic effect, it is true, wet rarely permanent,
hut for the time it was so wonderful
as often tQ look liko lOjtoratiun from the
dead. .
F!u.\U takon into tho stomach, it n?
proper to observe, are Hot subjected to tho
slow process of digestion, but aro absorbed
directly into the system; so that, when
we take a moderate draught, the whole of
it is taken up from the stomach in a very
few minutes. Keeping in view (his (act.
and the above striking illustration of the
influence of the condition of the blood
upon the body at large, it becomes enay la
conceive why, in a state ot exhaustion
from abstinence, drink should be moro
speedily restorative and refreshing than
food. *'
Thirst, like appetite for food, is intend,
ed to direct us when and in what quantity
wo ought to drink ; and so long as wo
confine ourselves to tho fluids with which
nature provides us, there is little chance
of our going far wrong by listening to its
calls. But when we come to the use of
fermented and stimulating liquors, which
excite a thirst not recognised by nature*
the principle ceases to operate. At present,
however, my observations apply entirely
to the former, and I shall" touch
upon these other liquids when treating o?
diet in a subsequent part of the volume,
