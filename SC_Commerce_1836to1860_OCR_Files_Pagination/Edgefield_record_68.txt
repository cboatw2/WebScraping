- TEXAS.
Causes qf the sglease of SantiaAa.-T he
following comntauniatiott comes to hanoi at
'a very favorablp re, w'hen the presses
-from every qi. 'e rife with specula
tia resp" u W reasons that actuated
th'e, Toinan chi. Magistrate in releasing
the captive President of Mexico-.
For the information and satisfaction of
those at a distance who feel interested in
the welfare of this interesting country, per
haps it would be no - more-- than proper for
us Lo-btate that the entleman who favored
us with this'omni'cation is a highly re
spected gentldman of the Natchez bar, and
who being intimately acquainted with the
head of the government and the leading
men of Texas, has all the adequate oppor
tunities of speaking authentically on the
subject.
Thisexpose of the course of policy adopt
ed by the Texians is highly satisfactory,
land. although we have been inclined to
doiubt the expediecy of the measure, we
aire now .convinced that 'the interests and
welfare of the infant republie may he really
proamoted by Santa Anti's restoration to
liberty, while at the very worst it can do
them nuo.harm, if. the results anticipated
tidrefrom should'eiot be realized.
To ihe Editor of the Nathchez Courier.
SiR-The Mexicain General Santa Ana
and his friend and aid-ae-camp, Col. Al.
monte have been released from their cap
tivity in Toexas, and passed up the river a
few (lays ago on their way to the city of
Waihington. They are escorted on be
half of the Texian Government by Colonel
Uockley, Inspector General of the A rmy,
Col. Bee, late Secretary of- the Treasury
and Capt.. Patton. I acedmpanied them
from 'this place to Vicksburg, and the views'
which have induced the visit of Sauta Auna
to our capitol, have been placed in my
possession with the request that I should
make public so much of them as might be
interesting to the people of this country.
In view of the speedy and pacific adjust
ment of the sanguinary war which has ex
isted between Mexico and Texas,. the cap
tive general solicited permission frqln tie
Texian Government to throw himself upon
the protection of the United States, and
claim the interposition of the m-diatory of
fAcesf their Uherta'giiu-te. lie proposed
-to acknowledge the Republic of Texas an
independent and sovereign nation-or to
agree to the incorporation of her territory
into the North A merican Unionlf the other
parties interested should so determine.
Being a prisoner ot wvar--and the Mexican
Government having expressly declared that
it would hold no negociation with Texas
through General Santa Aria while lie so re
mained in duresse, it became necessary, if
his authority and influence were to 1be madle
available at all, that he should at once be
placed in a different attitude, .in which he
might, set free and untrammelled, unbiassed
by any despairing circumstances, hut ac
cording to his unquestioned legal right
that he shoulil, in fact, be restored to the
full andecomplete possession of all his law
ful authority and power as President of
Mexico. To effect this, his immediate and
unconditional release by the geierniment of
Texas was indispensably requisite---ad
under the pccyliar circumstsnees which
exist in connexion with his captivity, it was
deemed advisable that the p acificatory of
fices should be invokgi of sonie neutral
power, friendly to botft 'elligerent par
ties, and impartial betwveen them.
.General Santa Ana therefore proposed to
visit WTashington, and solicit the mediation
of the President of the United States, and
his proposal was acceded to by the Execu
tive of Texas, who believed thamt niothing
could possibly be gained by detaiping him
longer. On the first of M arch nett the
term of his Presidentship will ex~plie, after
which time he would be utterly valueless as
a prisoner.
The people of Texas are anxious to ter
minate their war. They wish to live at peace
withMexico. They desire most heartilyv to
establish their government, and if possible
to anntex themselves to our own Union
They conld hardly hope to attain their oh
jest while they held the chief of thmir enemy
in the bonds of imprisonment. -They have
therefore, .in a spirit of magnanimity de
sirving of all praise, voluntarily surrendered
him to his liberty,on the pledge of his word of
honour -that peace shall lbe restored, that
the relations of amity and friendship shall
be cultivated~- andi cherished. To detain
him could avail them nothing-to relieve
him, afforded at least, the prospect of ad
vantage. .If their hope shall be realized,
the blessings of a prosperous pence will fall
upon them- if disappointed, the execra
tions of the civilized world will he visited
upon their enemy, and him whom they
have conquered, they can conquer again.
Respectfully, yonr obedient servant,
JNO. M. ROSS.

* Brady,
Capt . Cooper, Judg Advocate
-Pursuant'.to order, ne urt amseambled
his morning at half post,10 eldik, 'when
, Scott announced to then that hhad
eeived no informatios of the of
any new witnesses, nor could bol a
giy conclusion as to what time he' ghf
Dapect them. Many of them are' gentlemen
16 civil life over whom the Court has no
toatrou_-they may obey the summons
W they may not, as suits their convenience
a? pleasure. Under this state of uncertain
ty, he would say to the Court, that if they
should feel disp sed to take a recess for a
eek or ten days, he. would employthe
interval by making a summat. of the im
mense mass of testimony *bleh has been'
laid before the Court, so that ito time would
be lost, and it would give the witnesses an
:pportunity to arrive before the final ad
ournment of the Court. Such testimony
is may'hereafter be received, he- said,
:ould easily'be introduced in the summary
which he proposed to make.
The Judge advocate observed that the
Court had a question to propose to Gen.
Clinch, who was then present, and which
Oas accordingly put as follows: .
By the Court. What influence had the
movement of Maj. Gen. Gnines against the
Seminole Indians in 1836, in-the results of
the campaign conducted by MNaj.Gen.Scott
against that enemy in Florida, in the same
year ?
Answer. I am of the opinion that the
novenent of Maj. General Gaines' com
maid in Florida did not materially- afn'et
he operations of Maj. Gen. Scott. Gen.
Gaines' command did consuie several
thousand rations, but the materials of that
:ommnand were of the best kind, anl would
inve been of advantage to the coimmander
)f any army.
General Scott immediately arose and
-egged the indulgence of the Court and
Gen. Clinch, while lie further interrogated
the latter upon this point. While Gen.
Scott was engaged in writing the question,
Den. Clinch dropped a few remarks in re
lation to what he conceived (and gave ut
terence to-that Gen. Scott was ".fishing
ror ninnoes") a. ridiculous idea that a few
larrels of pork or flour, had made any dif
rereuce in the results of the catmpnign.
I look" said the brave and distinguished
Clinch, "to higher and nobler game-let
he curse of this sad business rest where it
thould."
By Gen. Scott. The -consumption of
ubsistence drawn from the depot at Fort
Drane by Gen. Gaines' troops-wvas not
the train obliged to replace from the St.
Johns, and did not this extra lai.our-con
rAbuto much to break down and weaken
the train.
Answer. The provisions fnrqishcil Gci.
Paines were dran i from the St. .ohins,
aid the train must, of course, have heen
nore or less affected in performiug'4e
*oute.
By Gen. Scott. By the addition of Gei.
G1ainecs' troops to your column. wast not the
-ight wing rendered stronger than had been
iriginalb intended, and stronger than was
ound to be necessary ?
Answer. I thought myself that the ad
lition of these troops sirengthened the col
mno I edmmanded vdry much ; but I he
ieve the troops composing the right wing,
odependent of that number. could have
erfornmed the route they did. It was ren
Ieredl stronger, .I believe, than was the
>riginal intentioni of Maj. General Scott.
I tuyself think that they were an amcquisi
ion, as they were cotmposed of reg'ulars,anmd
rallant and eflicient volunteers from Louis
Geni. Scott signified his wrillingness to
lismiss the writness from furither attenidace
.gion thme Court. The General had peir
nission to proceed to the North, where lie
soes to visit a soii and a daughter ;when
ufter spending a few daysehie will return,
ad pass the winter at Wasihingion, for thme
rurpose of utrging thp claims of the citizens
if Florid a for injury received during the
Seminole dlisturhanices. Geni. Clinch will
)e th-e niext Governor of Florida, and~ he
wrill make the most eflicienut one they ever
mad.
The President of the Cosat announced
hat they wvotnk adjourn to meet in this
place on the 4th of January next, at half
past 1 o'clock.
Geni's. Macombe, Atkinson, and Brady
leave town this dayv, (Saturday,) with their
rainilies for Waushmgtmon, wrhither Captain
Hlitchcock, Capt. Drane and Capt. Cooper
also go b~y same conveyatice.
Gen. SCutt will remain hoi'e, and occu
py himself in preparing his defence, which
will doubtless be a masterly production.
In the mean time your humble servanj will
furnish your columns with matter upon this
interesting suibjeet, and a brief view of the
past transactions in Florida.

FROM ST. AUGUSTINE.
By the Schr. S. S. Mills, Capt. South
wick, arrived yesterday from St. Augtustine
-we have received the Herald, of the 29th

No news from the seatrof- war. The
Hlerald says: - -
We have but e of im
portance, in rel ~ Iihan Aiffairs
to lay before ou 's weoek Gen.
Jesup has reach ahoo Swanp, and
found the fndians had gone from it. It is
probabile that the trail which was discover
ed a few weeks since leading across the Si.
John's river.' many have been thetrail of the
force. It is satisfactory to know that the
Seminole has been obliged to leave his
strong hol and seek other atid more secure
retreats; that he has been forced to aban
don what he~ considered his impenetrable
fastnesses, and impregnable fortresses ; that
he is eenvinced that the groat WVahoo
Swamp, and the Cove of the Witblacoo
dhe., no longer affords him a place of secu
rity against the invading forces of the wvhite
man.
The presumption is that they have iE
treated to the Everglades. This is said to
be a large tract of country, inundated, and
interspersed wimth knowls or islands,sand the
intervals Ailled with long saw grasses.

DESTRUCTIVE' F[ E.
Ojice of the QaLriot,
BALTIMUo, De 20.
Yesterday moruiing shortly atcr 8.ek
the alarm of firc was sounded iiOurin ti.
It was round to procee4 fr-iim 4ea0 the cen
tre of the compeact ran'gI or buidings on
the north side of.. Haltiiomd street, hetn een
Sharp I.alI and Clarke'sstreet, nearly op
posito tihe. Baltimore house. The fire ori
gitinted it; the back builditng of I he P i
ses occupied by Mr. P. Albimon, as iran
cy and varicty store, and owing to the very
combiustible nature of the inateriuls with
which it camte in cointact, in this establish
mnent, had already made comiderable head
way when first discovered. In a very.few
minutes that building with its whole con
tefits, was oie mlass of flamue-hiddinig de
fiance to the ntinost 'elforts ot' our fire de
patmieut to arrest its Orogrcss. The flames
thus fiercely fed by Mr. Albinson's large
stock, .oon extended ~to the adjoining ware
house on the west, oeciiied by Messrs.
Ores and Morning. Merchant Tailors, and
thence again to the next warehouse west

n'hardwaro stosm. These three large build
ings. with a lnr.V- shure of their valuable
contents were' utterly destroyed-nothing.
indeed remmaining (f the former, lint por
tiosns of the bure and blackened walls.
The fourth building of the block, occu

was next assailed by the destrnctive element.
and greatly dlamagtied, especially iln its tup
perV stories, biefore its progress could he ar
rested. But then," notwithstanding the
height anid compactness of tho builditngs,
andh the ditflculty of gaining acecess to tiny
pioint lbut the front, the energy and perse
verance of the fire companies finally tri
nuphed, & put an' end to its further ravages.
Mr. Albiinson's a hbole stock w as destroy-'
ed. Hie had an insutrance to the amannal
of $1000-which of course fell considerably
short -of his loss. The valuable stockof
Messrs. Orem and Morning was also, the
greauter part of It consumed. Their insur
ance is undarmtood to be $9000, but their
loss is supposed to exceed this b'y several
thounsanid dollars. Of iMry Rigden's large
mandt valuable stock of hard ware, a portion

Gentlemen,-l have been informed since
my return to this cit), that Mr. Durietone of
the unfortunate su fferers on bonard the Dol

I there fore conceive it a duty I owe to his
friends and relatives, to state that-he was
not. Mr. Elerm wvas the principal, a gen
tleman of the highest reputation, and whose
character, as an engitneer, stood pro-emi

*trous man, very corret in all his habits,
'and an excellent mechanic.

make one trip in the boat, to assist Mr. E.

my entire dsatisfactioni, I employed him to
gthe one trip, with Mr. E. to assist him
an the overhauling of the. engine, as the
short space of time the boat was asllowed1
hero, prevented our doing it before she left.
The valves wvere very mach out of order,and
wanted grinding ia their seats, having wvork

the United States armed Brig Porpoise,
while she was ashore on the north breaker
of St.-'Simuons' bar."
The explosioi was undoubtedlly caused
by the want okyioper attention of the en
