fiction occurred in New Orleans on the
3d. inst.
It appears that a young Spaniard was J
lying in the last stages of yellow fevpr.
next door to the printing office of Mr. G?
in Chnrtres street. The physician Dr.
B., was sent for, but before his arrival,
the young mnn had ceased to live, according
to the opinions of those in the house,
bo that when he arrived he found his pa .
tient covered with a white linen, and reported
as dead. Tnat very eve ting they
washed and cleansed the young man,
and having put on bis burial dress, they
laid him on his hed until the morning.?
In the morning a coffin was got, and all
the necessary preparations were made.
He was then taken and put in his coffin,
hut no sooner was he dropped in it than
he jum|?ed up and nsked where they
were going to place him. They then
conducted him in a carriage to a coloree

The following resolutions were offered
t?y Mr. Randall, at the Philadelphia
City and County ^Vhirr Meeting held on
Monday hist, in the State House Yard.
They were received with acclamation,
and adopted without a dissenting voice:
Resolved. That it is right and proper
to impose the most severe system of taxation.
to preserve inviolate the honor
and faith of the State, and that we dep.
rebate any further recourse to loans for
the purpose of pa ving either the principal
or interest of the debts now due by the
Commonwealth.
Resolved, That the Legislature of
Pennsylvania he earnestly requested to
compel the Banks of this Common wealth
forthwith to resume sprite payments,
or to go in'o liquidation for tho payment
of their debts.
The Hon.. C. R. Ogden, Attorney
General of Canada, was recently in this
city, on his way to Boston, where he will
take passage in the next steamer for England.
A gentleman who conversed with
him informs us that the Attorney Gene,
ral look measures for Col. Grngan's release
immediately on being informed of
bis arrival at Montreal. After Grogan
had been brought into the United States,
lie returned voluntarily into Canada, but
the people declined arresting him, so that

SOl'TH CAROLINA COLLEGE.
The regret which ha* been expressed
in so many quarters at the resignation
of VIr. Barnwell, as President of this In.
stit itio i, is we doubt not deeplyand universally
felt. The Hourislisng state of
the College during hi* administration,
immediately succeeding too, as it did,
such a gloomy period in its history, the
place lie had gained in the respect and affections
of the Students, the confidence
ho had inspired in the parents and guardians,
all *l>eak a language not to be misunderstood
; and we, in common with
other,sympathies in the lass which the
State has s istaincd.
Ii is quite common amcng the great
majority of the community to suppose
that tliev have very litle interest in the
conduct or management of the College,
unless they have either sons or wards
which they are educating, or intend to
educate there. But this is a mistaken
idea. The South Carolina College is a
public I'isiution?the great fountain of
learning from which has emanated ant!
from wuich is still to be executed, the
miiiih which are to control the State in
all its departments, social and legislative.
The young men who are educated there,
are to he dispersed throughout the State,
and will g.ve tone and character to the
public opinion of the commonwealth.
The complexion which this public opinion
assumes, will greatly depend upon
those who have the control of the College,
and hence, the interest which every Carolinian
has in the judicious selection of a
presiding officer of an institution of such
mighty influence?the province of which
is to mould the principles and characters
of the men who are to be out future governors
and law.givers.
Feeling as we do. a deep interest in
the success of this noble institution, and
? ? ? ?.?1.4 ...U!AU
Claiming i n; i igui, ivuit'i c?ci^ i/uuicii
has, of making suggestions in relation to
lis offices, we take this occasion to mentiou
the name of an individual, who, if
Ive can he induced to accept the office, will
t wifisentJy sustain the interests, the dignity
afcd purify of the College. We allude
to the Hon. John JJellon O'Neal, an up.
right Judge, a pure .Patriot an honest and
consistent Christian. Judge O'Neal is
the man of all others, with;'i our knowledge,
best calculated to fill i.his high responsible
station?possessingsou.nd intelligence
and good sense, firmness of prin- |
ciplennd sincerity of feeding, dignity of!
person, gentleness of manners, and of
spotless moral character. From under,
his administration we might expect an army
of graduates mingling with their fel.
low citizens in e\erv portion of the State,
which, in a few years would work a rnigh
ty and glorious moral revolution among
aur people.
We invite public attention to this sng.
geslion, and especially would we ask the
Trustees of the College, to give it their

The hook of Dr. Grant, just published,
will furnish the reading public with mat.
ler of peculiar interest. [Ic has resided
several years in Persia, among the Xestorians
about Lake Ooroomia ; and. having
become familiar with their language
ttr.d manners, and learnt something of the tr
N.ostorinns of the mountains, determined vt
to pay them a visit, though discouraged T
from ihe attempt by the reported dangers ) fe
of the way. His boldness was crowned la
with the most gratifying success. He th
penetrated into an extensive region, long vi
secluded from the rest of the world by lu
mountains nlrnost impassable, and rlouhlv i le
guarded by the fierce tribes of Koords | tr
who stain the sides and bases of these ' th
eminences with blood ; and there discov- j al
ered a nation of Christians, living in prin- j ti1
itive simplicity, who received with open j
arms n visiter from the Western corti- ol
nent, of the existence of which they had w
hardly heard. fn
There, in the recesses of a region ?e. ai
eluded by Nature, he found churches not ei
less than 1400 years old, and Christian di
rites so little corrupted by false doctrine ir
that he could conscientiously join in wor- tf
ship with the people, whom h? styles the pi
Alhigenses of the East." They speak si

The volume comprises the journai of d<
Dr. Grant's perilous and adventurous ai
journey, with interesting accounts of the th
people, and his cogent arguments in favor e<
of their Isrneiitish origin, whose justice tt

Some idea may he formed of 1 he state w
of ignorance in which our countryman cl
found-the people of that secluded region cl

met with a ijnery of the following kind : i p'

Thtgouk.?This monstrous practice n<
hnsonly lately been brought to light, and pi
it is described in Major Sleeman's report H
under the name of Megpunnnism. t
41 There seems to he pood ground to he- ir
hove that the. system begun with the siege tt
of Bhurtpore, in the year 1820. Parents c<
had, no doubt, long before this been oc- 1 ol
oasionally murdered lor the sake of their / di
young children, in thai and in oiher parts J tl
i f India where children are aUotned t" be \ n<
bought and sold; but we have no reason to ! hi
j believe that there was, before that time, ai
i any gang, in that or in any other part of c<
Uidia, that followed this system of mur. p<
deric'ST indigent and helpless parents for pi
the sak'E of their children as an exclusive ju
| trade. We have reason to believe that it ai
I has not yet extended bevond the Upper u
I Doonb, the D'df.j territories, and the Ra- hi
Ijpootana and AIwar states : and the able ai
i and successful exertions of Lieutenant d\

to suppress t?i*? system where it has pre- I

to other parts. It will he seen that
these gangs always select for their victims n
the parents and grown-up children ofdis- e3
tressed families, who have been driven to j(
emigration by famine or domestic misfof.
tunes. Brinjarahs, who all over India UJ
trade in children thai have been stolen q
from their parents, and in prostitutes? w
who purchase those thai are good looking a<
wherever they can get them?will give w
more for those whose parents are certified (j,
to be dead than for any others, because g
they have less apprehension of such chil- (j
dren ever absconding in search of them, or e:
being reclaimed by them. In seasons of p?
great and general calamity, like those by
which Upper India has been for some (j
vears oast afflicted, great numbers of the
most respectable fumilies, of all castes, w
have been reduced to indigence, and obli. c|
ged to emigrate ; and the children of par. c,
ents of this description, who have been hi
taken great care of and sheltered from the jyj
sun, and who arc, in consequence, com- jr
monk very fair, are those most sought 0|
after bv these murderers.
In such seasons of calamity, the per. t.i
mission to purchase andsell children saves, s|
no doubt, a great number from starva. w
tion; bin1 a* seasons, happily, even tc
in India, return, after long intervals, and e<
as this perin^8'on's liable to foster such r|
horrible crimed ** ?r? here exposed, it [
had perhaps hetu?-f f>e withheld altogether. {y
It is, I believe, understood, where such I &
purchases of children are permitted, that, I m

to secure it recognition of civil and soci.aj > ru
rights in some circles of seeietv above the
very lowest. Lieutenant Mills, in his let. sti
tor of the 15th of October, 1838, states: \|

mviction of these gangs for specific acts
