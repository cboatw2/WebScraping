Maj. Joshua Lazarus, Gen. J dines Gilles?ie,

A. H. Kullock. and Capt. C. Vanderford.

place on Thursday night the ltith inst., Maj.
Blakcney CJiairmao of the Committe, prencnted
the following Report and Resolutions,
which were adopted, and ordered to be pub.
lislied in the Fanners' G izette.
The Committee appointed to consider the
proposition of a portion of the citizens of
SumVr District, to change the present mail
route 1'otn the .\\;rtli to the South and South
West, have had the same under consideration
uid respectfully
REPORT:
That your Committee concur fully in the
riews ? xpressed by ihe Citizens of Camden
it a recent meeting: that it is inexpedient to
har.ge the present mail route, which passes
through Cneraw, Camden, and Columbia, so
is to pass by Society Hill, Bishopville, and
Siaw-slimo, as proposed by a portion of the
i-itizena in Sumter District, and your Coinloit'ee
cannot refrain from expressing their
Jecided opinion that ttie views set forth in
favor of a change, are untenable, either as
being advantageous to the Post Office Department,
or beneficial to the community at
arge?That the proposed route would be of
more advantage to the Post Office Department
than the present, must depend much on
Ihe amount of postage that would be received
from it, and the excellency as well as the dieLance
of the two routes. The postage that
would be received on the proposed route from
w here it would leave the present line, (between
Cher aw and Fayetteville, N. C.,) ?n to
Gadfden would nof~"exceed annually more
than $lUU0nr ?150(1; Whereas the amount
received on trie present route from the Towns
i?f Cher.iw, Camden, and Columbia, is about
?I0,U0U without including the intermediate
utfices.
The proposed route would cause delays
and difficulties 'ru*n which the present route
is exempt, as will appear by a comparison of
l|p* routes, the proposed route would cross the
W'alcfse River, al or near iStatesburg, wii??rc
I here is no bridge ?where frequently, a* your
committee are informed, i: is impassible to
i!foss the ferry at high water, Whereas the
present route crosses the Walereo River at
Camden on a Bridge, where tin drlay or
difficulty can arise; Tijc proposed route
would cross Lynch's Creek much lower than
the present, where tho styaipp is much wider
and more difficult to pass; Tlje proposed
route would cross the Pee Dee River at ISopiety
Hill where there is no bridge and where
as is known to your committee, vyquld be delay
and difficulty in high water, the present route
crosses the Pee Dee River at Chcraw, on a
bridge, with perfect safety at all times;?The
presept route passes through and near a grain
growing country; and much healthier than
the o:.e proposed.
Your Committee, therefore, have no
hesitation in stilting thai by the proposed
change of the present maij route, the
chances of failures in (lie mail would be
much enhanced, and tho number of passengers
much diminished ; that it would
he impossible for contractors to take the
contract on as favorable terms as on the
present route, nil of which would he detri.
mental to the Department. But it is
' urged that the change would be advantageous
to the community, now your cwft*
mil tec cannot conceive what community
, is to he hen' fitted by the change, unless
it he the community of Statesburg and
' Bishopville, through which the proposed
route would lead, and this your committee
will admit, but at the same time with
i great deference would state thnt the advantage
\ypuld he given to these small
communities at too great a sacrifice to
other communities equally or more important
to the Post Office Dcoarsment. The \
present route passes thro u^jhe j
largest commercial Towns in the inwrior |
of South Carolina* (viz.) Cheraw, Cam- I
i den, and Columbia, nil a; the head of )
I?.wl t r. <1... i,r,,/liw.n n f 1

tho surrounding country for several hun- !
! dred miles is brought: also to and from
which an immense number of individuals i
I on business, must necessarily, travel; are \
these places, then, not entitled to conside- j
ration, are they to he postponed with a i
cross mail two or three times a week, and
that too when thnv pay to tho department
from ?10,000 to$l2,000annually-mereh
to benefit a few persons residing at
Stateshnrg and Bishopvillo, small villages
1 of no commerce or trade, and a few planters
dispersed through the adjacent country,
who may chance to take two or three
* weekly newspapers. But. again, i.ot
'only will the immediate communities, Co.
luuibia, Camden, and Cheraw, be ntfected
i by this proposed change, but all trade to
their markets, and also the Commercial
j cities of Charleston and New York, are
much interested in the continuance of the
' present direct line through these places. .
But it is stated that the south western
communities will he benefitted by this
change because it will shorten the distance
i and thereby expedite the mail some 3 or
i 4 hours. Now, according to the information
of your committee the great south
i western mail route, is at present by Wil
' mington and Charleston, and intersects
this route at Augusta, therefore the change
i can at present he of no benefit to the
, South West; hut oven suppose that our
! 14 foreign relations"should becomo embar
O _
J rasscd and warlike, as intimated by the
citizens of Statesburg and vicinity, nnd
the great south western mail should pass
t this route, (and here are two suppositions,)
the proposed change would !hen not expedite
the mail for the reason that the
1 delays nnd difficulties abovo expressed as
I to tho proposed route would more than
overbalance the difference in the distance
! of the two routes. And again, the rail
i road from Gadsden to Columbia will be
| completed in the course of two months
and when completed the argument in faj
vor of the change must fall. Your comHinheraJd
Jhat there are
numbers of cross mnilrbiite8~inrersecijaff
at Cheraw, Camden, and Colombia, alt or
! which would he deranged by the proposed
change.
j Your Committee therefore recommend
the adoption of the following resolutions:
Resolved, That it is inexpedient to
change the mail route which passes
through Cheraw, Camden, and Columbia,
to that proposed by the citizens of Stateshurt*
in Sumter Distiict. and its vicinity.
Resolved, That a copy of these proceedings
he forwarded to the Postmaster
General, our Senator* in Congress, our
immediate Representative, the Hon. T.
I). Sumter, the Hon. John Campbell,
of .Marlboro', and the Hon. Edmund L)e- j
j perry, of N. C. *
Resolved, That a copy of these proceed- !
ings ho forwarded to VVadesboro' and ,

ration of the citizens of those places.

event," his wretched son replied, " I
should not hesitate to march over your

point in no other way." Perceiving
I from this remark, what a hluck-hearted
