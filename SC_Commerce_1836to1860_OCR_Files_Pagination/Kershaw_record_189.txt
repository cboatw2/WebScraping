PROSPECTUS
OF THE
LITERARY BULLETIN
Charleston, S. C.
IN offering to the patronage of tlio public, a new |
literary paper, we are |>erfcctly aware that we
axe but repeating an oft-lriod experiment. The resuit,
however, wc would fain believe, will be different.
We are, it is true, conscious of the possession
of no talent or ability superior to that of our predecessors,
but we rely, (perhaps.-indeed, with too

creasing taste of the ago of literature ; a taste, the
evidence of which is before us in the number of periodicals,
engaged solely in its cultivation?in the
lyceums, the libraries and academics devoted to science
and learning. Whilst the North and the
West arc thus assidiously employed in the exemal
plary task of mental improvement, wo will not suppose
that the South intends longer to bear the
weight of that heavy incumbus which heretofore
has whelmed it in an iulellectual slumber more
lasting and profound than that physical one which
crcwhile enwrapped the seven sleepers of Ephesus.
it is with a hope thus founded, and with an intention
if wc cannot win success, at least to deserve
it; that notwithstanding the uniform failure of those
who have preceded us, we have ventured to claim
the patronage and to labor for the applause of the
public. The stake shall be played for; how tho

Our object wiH be to render the columns of the
Bulletin both useful and amusing. For this purpose,
while ono portion is devoted to original Essays,
Tales and Poems, furnished from time to time
by our correspondents and collaborators, another
portion shall bo occupied by selected matter culled
from everv spot of interest and instruolion, in tho
vast field of literature.
The productions of the press shall pass in leview
before us, an I on every work which merits our
notice an impartial criticism shall be bestowed.?
To lig -t :i?crature and to learned science shall alike
be meted their due portion of censure or of praise,
and it shall not be our faults if our patrons do not
know the intrinsic value of every hook, (at least in
onr own opinion) before they begin to read.
He, says Or. Franklin, who is good at excuses, is
seldom good nt any thing else; and the same we

EDITORS,
MRS. ANN S. Stephens.
William \V. Snowobn.
! Assisted by many of the most popular writer*.
Since the .publication of the May number, the demand
for the Ladies' Companion, has been unprecedented
and beyond the most sanguine anticipations.
At tho commencement of the volume an additional
number of copies were printed, which was
considered at the time adequate to satisfy all the
orders which m ight be received, and leave a considerable
numbe ou hand fur subsequent calls- The
publisher is more than graiifled in stating that the
whole edition was nearly exhausted before the issuing
of the seventh number of the volume; and at
this time but very few complete sets remain on
hand, to supply the numerous orders which arc
dailv received from every section of the U. S.
In consequence of this great untorseen increase of
new subscribers, he has determined to double the
number of impressions for the subsequent year;
while he most gratefully appreciates the unprecedented
encouragement extended to the Ladies' Companion,
and at til" same time, he begs to assure the
readers of the magazino and the public in general,
that it is his ardent resolution to meet it with a correspondigg
liberality on his part to merit its continuance.
SPLENDID STEEL ENGRAVINGS
by our best artists, ccompany each nuinncr?illustiated
by Tales and spirited Sketches?which will,
as heretofore, continue to be magnificent and far
superior to ttiose published in any oilier magazine in
America.
The Ladies' Companion contains a larger quantity
of reading than any other magazino issued in itii?
country, and its subscription price is only three dollars
a year, while the groat combination of talent
scoured for the coming year will render it unequalled
by any other periodical.
ITS LITERARY CHARACTER!
Will undergo considerable change, as the publisher
of the Lucius' Companion, in order to show his
ippreciation of the public favor already extended to
liiin so liberally, has secured the aid of
Mrs. Ann S. Stephens'
iuto Editor of tho 'Portland Magazine," and author
of a series of the most beautiful and jiopulnr tales
ever presented to an American public. No lady
possessing gre-tor vaiicty of talent, or better calculated
to atu in conducting a ladies magazine, could
have been selected from the galaxy of female geniut
which is the glory of our country. In addition t
the powerful talents of Mrs. Stephens, tlie proprietor
' has secured a list of contributors, which combined
will render the Ladies' Companion one of the mos'
interesting and talented magazines of the day.

With many others who will oocasioually contribute
to the pages of the work, an<l every exertion will be
made to render the Ladies' Companion, what a work
devoted to the female portion of the community
should t>e, interesting, useful and instructive.
THE MUSICAL DEPARTMENT
Is under the supervision of Mr. J. Watson, whose
qualifications for the task arc too well known to require
our testimony.
This department of the Ladies' C unpanion, has
ever command d a large share of attention, and has
been looked upon with no littlo interest by its readers,
and nmre "specially the^Ladies, whom the
publisher i < in rhe highest legrce anxious to please.
It will co itinuelo be n subject of m ire than usual
care to him. and to the Professor under whose supervision
it is pla-'od, to make tint portion of the
magazine al.otted to music, more than evei doscr?'inn
of the countenance of every lover of uristc. It h.i? {
ever Iveu and will continue lo be thu desire to have
all pieces of music printed correctly and flruofrom
errors.
THE WORK IN QENER \L.
Over every department an equally careful super
vision will bo strictly exercised bv the Editors, and
all appropriate expenditures will be liberally bestowed
as it is the design oflhe publisher, with the aid of his
contributors and the advico of his friends to make
tho Ladies' Companion distinguished for the beauty
ami accuracy of its typography?the variety and
high tone of its literary articles?the quality and
value of its music?and the unequalled splendor of
its pictorial cmlielishnicnts.
It is the determination of the publisher lo use every
means (o maintain the superiority which the Ladies'
Companion lias obtained. For four vears lie
lias steadily pursued a course ot improvement, and
ho flatters himself that his present ficililies arc such I
is to give the Ladies' Companion eminent advantages
jvcrall other publications of its character.
From the foregoing it will ho perceived that the i
Ladies' Companion embraces every department within
the range of Belles-Lett res and tho Fine Arts;,
and no exertions or expense will lie denied too great
lo render the work equal to any other extant. Tlic ,
flattering and general testimonials of nearly every
rontempararyjour.ini in th" United States, and in
fact, many 011 the other side of the Atlantic, have
Urongly asserted the Undeniable claims of tho Lalies'
Companion to the support of the public general- ;

riOUS tiin can be made doubl*. or single. If <
jl made double, they reduce labor, and gin just i
double, the quantity oi cotton over the single cylinder
Gin, no other knd having been in use prevous J
to this patent; and whether single or double, they I
are found to improve the quality of the cotton, by I
more perfectly cleaning it. They can be made to
contain from 20 to 160 saws in a stand, and whether
small or large, one hand will be sufficient to attend
them. The Gins have mechanical feeders and
hoppers attached to them, which free the cotton
from leave^ trash, dirt, &c. before it can reach the
saws, and by the thorough hackling operation it
receives from the feeders, which uiake two revolutions
to one of the saws, it is almost in a half
gined state, before it descends to the saw. By a
very simple arrangement of a screw to each set of
gaates, on which the hoppers rest, and through
which the teeth of the feeders pass, they can oe
made to teed slow or fast to suit the condition of
the cotton at the time. When made double, the
saws are placed on two sets of cylinders and turn
upon each other in opposite directions, and are
cleansed by two sets of brushes tliut have tourrevo.
lutions to one of twe saw. The two cylinders can
be detached so as to enable tht olanter to run one
or both at pleasure, although embraced with feeders,
&c. in one stand. The whole is put in operation
with a drum and band, as in the ordinary Gin, and
, may be propelled by horse, steam, or water powe.r.
It may also be propelled by iron running gear.
The force required to work it, is about the same as
! that ueceasary to move an equal number of saws in
J the common Gin. This Gin lias been put in
, operation in New Orleans for two or three weeks,
and its success tested in the presence of a large
number < f planters, merchants and others, and
received iheir general approbation
Several gentlemen have been so kind as to give
the Patentee their written opinion lespecting the
merits of the Gin. A number of others could be
added, but the following are deemed sulKcienl:

' The mere fact of its self-feeding, seems to inc to
bo a very valuable improvement; and besides, the
' quality of the cotton, as it comes out of the process,
appeared to me to be better and cleaner than
from the common Gins in use, and that it saves
' considerably in labor. Respectfully, A c.

It is desirable, when plantersgive orders for Gins,
they should accompany them with their views iii
regard to the arrangement of saws, breasts, brush- j
es, &c. It is found they differ in opinion. Some 1
desire saws of larger diameter than others. The J
most common size is 9 or 10 inches ; but some wish I
them 12 inches. Some wish 5 or G rows of brushes :
on an axle, while others do not want more than 4
at most. Some wish saws with 8 or 9 teeth to the
ineh. while others want 10 or 11. With so much |
discrepancy, we prefer they should, at the tiinc of :
giving orders, furnish a statement, of their wishes,
and the manufncturcrcrs can fulfil them in every
particular. Where it is left to our discretion, we
shall make them on the most modern and approved
plan An order can be executed, from the time it
is received, in the space of eight or nine weeks I
and i lie Gin in that time placed in the hands of the

OJUONS, Ij?IVI>OIY.?The original Hygoian
Vegetable Medicine, prepared by W. Mis
kin, Esq., Member of the Royal College of Surtjeons,
Licentiate of Apothecary's Company, Felo\v
of Dolt Court Society Surgeon to the Royal
Union Pension Association, Lancaster Place,
Waterloo Dridgc, and perpetual pupil of Cuy'e
and St. Thomas's llospituls, London.
This valuable medicine, the result of twenty
yenrs' experience and unpnrralleied success in the
extensive and highly respectable practice of the
proprietor, patronised by the faculty and nobility,
is now introduced to the notice ol the Atnriican
public, ul the earnest solicitation of a tiuinlerof
gentlemen of long and high standing in the piofession.
It is hoped, as a preliminary step, to
check the evils and fatal consequences arising
from the use of tlie numcious deleterious nostrums
foisted upon the public by the aid of fabricated
proofs of miraculous cures, and other frauds, by a
set of mercenary, unprincidled pretenders, so totally
ignorant of medical science that it is impossible
the monstrous delusion can any longer go
down with the intelligent people of this country.
These pills, mild and agreeable in their nature,
should be kept in every family in cases of suddi n
illness, for by their prompt administration, elude
ra, cramps, spasms, levers, and other alarming
complaints, which too often prove fatal, may be
speedily cured or prevented, in fact, all these
who value good health should never be without
them. They arc sold in packets, at 50 cents, < !,
and $.2 each, by every respectable druggist, bookseller,and
vender of medicine in the United States
and thcCanadas, with copious directions, together
with testimonials of professional ability from the
following eminent gentlemen; Sir Astley Cooper,
J. Ahernclhy, Jas. Diundell, M. I).. \V. Dark,
M. IT, J. Aston Key, A. Frnmpton, M, D otul
numerous others. The originals may ho pern in
possession of tlie general agent, hy whom tin- tne
liiciiie is imported into this country, and to whom
all applications for agencies must he made.
