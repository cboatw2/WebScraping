Oltivation of Corn.
The difference of opinion anion;' farmers
as to the best mode of cultivating
#*<?rn. induced me some years ago, to give
smrie attenlu n to the subject. The rea
sons assigned, and the exjioricnee of many
of the best agriculturists, in favor of the
^ system of level cultivation have convinced
lire that our present mode is nnl the best,
and that it is susceptible of a decided
change lor the better.
I am perfectly aware, that to question
the propriety of the exclusive use of the
plough in the cultivation of corn will he
laughed at, and that to intimate that the
ritlgmg of a corn field i- not the most certain
mode of ensuring a good crop will be
denounced as mere "book farming/' and
hence entitled to no respect.
The present mode of cultivation is generally,
to hum oh' the stalks and stubble
that may lie upon the ground?to break
up with a shallow furrow?plant the corn
withovt rolling or harrowing the ground
O o n
?then harrowing the corn while small,
and then hv ploughing as often as may
lie deemect necessary. In ploughing the
corn, the prevailing and almost universal
rule is, to piough close to the corn hills,
to cut the fibres of I he roots so as to increase
and dreitglhen the stalks, as you cut
the roots <>f trees in an orchard by ploughing,
to m rike the trre grow vigorously / / /
? ft throw the earth high up on the
slaiks, and to lay by the crop by plough,
ing three or four furrows between the
rows, thai i e giound may be well ndg.
< d, so as to rein in the moisture about the
htli.n of earn ! !
Tue sv -Jem of,culture, thut I believe
i- sustainable hv reason and ex|>erience?
is tin* opposite of ail this.
1. If tin-ground intended to be cultivate
I ?n corn liana sod upon it, it should
Ik.' broken up in the fall or winter preceding.
if the we ather is suitable ; if not, it
sbouid tie ploughed in February, or at
% least ill the tir>t week til March. If not
level it suouii! lie rolled, and if not mellow
it should be harrowed before planting.
2. If.stubble or corn ground, no stub,
ble nor stalks sbouid be burned or renin,
ved, unless taken to the manure pi/e?
should b? ploughed six inches deep, and
if not int how should be harrowed.
3. Wilde small, the corn should he
harrowed and the ground should lie afterC
* i
wards k? pi mellow ami loose by lac repealed
use of the cultivator.
4. On sod ground a plough should
never he used in the cultivation of corn.
r>. On other ground, the plough
should never he used, after the roots have
extended any distance from I he hills, and
ai no I line unless indispensably necessary
to prevent llie ground from baking.
(i. The fibres or small rools of the
corn should not he cut; the cutting ofi'of
every fibre depriving the stalk of a purl
ol its nourishment.
7. The earth should not he thrown
high up <>n the lulls, as it induces the
throwing out of additional spur roots. A
very slight portion of mould may he put
round the lull.
8. The ground in the cultivation of
corn should he kept as level as possible,
to permit the roots to extend in every
direction and to retain moisture, lodging,
cuts the roots?prevents the extension
of the surface roots beyond the middle
of the rows?drains the water from
the hills?exposes more surface to the
action of the sun, and is therefore injuri
ous to a crop in a dry season.
My own limited observation and cxpe
rience, satisfy me of the correctness of
the above rules to be oliserved, in the
cultivation of corn, and 1 now oiler the
opinions of the ablest and most practical
farmers in the United States to sustain
the position I have assumed.
Judge Bucd, who for good sense?for a
thorough knowledge of the science of agriculture,
for general intelligence?practical
experience?and for a most extensive
knowledge and familiarity with ^the
modes adopted by our agriculturists, was
unequalled by any man hi the United
States, in speaking of the cultivation of
this crop, expresses the following opinions
:
"The after culture consists in keep
ing I ho soil loose and free from weeds,
which is ordinarily accomplished by two
dressings, and in thinning the plants,
which latter may be done the frst booing,
or partially omitted till the last. The
' ' ? ? ? AA.n nn/1 c\C
practice UI piOllgilllig aiming gm n, u<><a
making large lulls, is justly getting into
disrepute: for the plough bruises and cuts
the roots of the plmts turns up the sod
and manure to waste, and renders the 1
crop more liable to sutler by drought.?
The first dressing should be performed as ,
soon as the size of the plants will permit, '
and the best implements to precede the
hoe is a corn harrow, adapted to the |
width of the rows, which every fanner |
can make. This will destroy most of the
weeds and pulverize the soil. The sec- 1
oud hoeing should be performed Ix'fore or
as soon as the tassels appear, and may he 1
preceded by the corn harrow, or a shallow
furrow of the plough, or what is better
than either by the cultivator. A slight j
earthing is beneficial, providing the earth
is scraped from the surface, and t ie sod
and manure not exposed. It will he
found liencficial to run the harrow or cub '>
tivator a third, and even a fourth time,
between the rows, to destroy weeds and
loosen the surface, particularly if the
season is drv."
' Some entertain a mistaken notion,
&
that it is prejudicial to stir the soil among 1
corn in dry weather, and others, that
weeds serve to present the evaporation of
moisture by a hot sun. The reverse of
these opinions is true. The exhaustion
of moisture by a plant is in the ratio of
the surface of its leaves and stalks pre* '
sented to the sun and air." '

to the wants of our families and our
farms than this. The late John Taylor,
of Virginia, termed it our nneat, meal
and manure.' Holding this high rank
in our farm economy, it is a subject of
moment tnadoptlhe best mode of culture,
As many districts are shv in producing
wheat, and as this crop is seriously threat,
ened by the new (to us) wheat insect, it 1
becomes more a matter of solicitude to <
render our corn crops productive. But i
as this grain demands more labor in its '
culture than other grain crops, so it is <
more important, on the score of profit, that >
it should be well managed, for if thirty 1
bushels an acre bo considered only a re- '
numeration for the labor bestowed on the J
crop?all that the product falls short of I
this must be a loss-and all that it exceeds,
a nettgain on the cultivation. The first
consideration in regard to the corn crop,
is to give it a dry mellow soil; the second (
that this soil l>e rich, fat or fertile; and |
the third, that the seed be timely put in 1
and t:<e crop well taken care of. Neither '
wet grounds, nor still' clays, nor poor 1
grounds, will repay bv their product, and
i labor required on a crop of corn. lie <
who has no oilier but these, should not
attempt to raise it as a field crop. He 1
had better besfow his labor upon other '
objects, and buy his corn. We think the '
best preparation for corn is a clover Icy, <
! well covered with a long manure from the <
! barn yard, well ploughed, and well har- '
! rowed. It is hotter to give sixty loads I
of dung to tlirec acres than to ten, upon *
J the ordinary lands of our neighborhood. I
The difference in product will not make <
up for the difference inlahor. Corn can <
hardly he dunged too high. What we <
have to recommend, that is not common
in the culture of this crop, is that double >
j the usual quantity of seed he applied? '
I the number of plants to be reduced at the '
weeding?in order to insure three or four '
j stalks iu each hill; that the roots he not
broken, nor the manure thrown to the '
surface by the plough, hut that the bar. '
row and the cultivator he substituted for
it, which will sufficiently mellow the sur- '
face and destroy weeds, and that the hills >
he hut slightly earthed. By ploughing ;
and hilling we conceive the manure is
wasted, the roots broken and bruised, and ;
limited in their range for food, the crop 5
| more exposed to injury from drought, and
! the labor increased."
In speaking of the plough in the cultivalion
of corn he again thus remarks? |
j **W? do not use it. We think its use ,
i prejudicial in breaking the roots, and in (
limiting their range for nutriment." ?
Mr. James M. Sutton, of St. George, <
Delaware, who raised upon seventy-nine i
acres bushels of corn, and who I
gives an accurate and detailed account ?
of the condition and cultivation of each <
field, makes this remark in relation to the J
use of the plough : (
"In order to attest the advantage of the
cultivator over the plough, for tilling {
corn, he had live rows in this field that (
! he lapped the furrow to, with a plough, 1
previous to going over it the last time ^
with the cultivator. He soon discover,
ed that the growth of these five rows fell
short, in height, of those adjacent, and j
yielded one-fifth less corn. I
"Them is no doubt but that the true {
mode of tilling corn, especially w here sod i
ground is used, is to plough deep, and use c
nothing but the fallow and the Hake har. i
row for its cultivation. 1ly not disturb- t
ingthe sod ploughed down, it remains 1
there as a resprvoirj of moisture, and an
exhilating principle throughout the season,
to the growth of corn."
JAMES M. SUTTON.
Upon Mr. Sutton's-report of his crop,
Judge Buel adds the following :
"Note.?The management which led
to the extraordinary product of corn,
should be deeply impressed upon the
mind of every corn grower. 1. The
ground was well dunged with long man;
ure; 2. It was planted on a grass ley,
with one deep ploughing; 3. It was well ,
pulverized with the harrow; 4. The
plough was not used in the after culture,
nor the corn hilled, Fbut the cultivator
only used ; 5. the sod wns not cUsruri?pti,
nor the manure turned to the surface ;
and 0. the corn was cut at the ground
when it was fit to top. These are the
the points which we have repeatedly urged
in treating of the culture of this crop;
and their correctness is put beyond question
by this notable result. The value of
lime and marl are well illustrated in the
second experiment.
CONDUCTOR."
Mr. Chares H. Tomlinson, of Schenectady,
New York, in giving an account of
his experience, says :
The two last years corn has been raised
in the following manner, on the Mohawk
Flats, near this city. If in grass,
the land is ploughed and well harrowed,
length w ise of the furrow, without disturbing
the sward. The last season, the field
was rolled after being planted, wi th evident
benefit, as it made level. When the
corn is three inches high, the cultivator is
passed through bsth ways; and twice
afterwards it is used in the same manner;
no hilsare mn.de, but the ground is kept
level. Neither hand-hoe, nor plough E.re
used, after the corn is planted. Fields
manured with coarse manure have been
tilled in the same manner. Corn tilled
in this way is as clean of weeds, as when
tilled in the usual way : it is no more
liable to be blown down, and the produce
is equally good. It saves a great de al
Df hard labor, which is an expensive item
in the usual culture of corn. Last Octo.
I>cr, ten rods were measured out, in two
Jifferent places, in acorn field, or gnuis
and?-the ono yielded ten, the other I
aine, bushels of cars. In one corn field,
ifter the last dressing in July, timothy
inil clovcr-sced were sown, and in the
fall the grass appeared (o have taken as
well as it has done in adjoining fields
where it has been sown with oats."
Upon which Judge Buel again remarks:
' All, or nearly all, the acoounts we have
published of great products of Indian
corn, agree in two particulars, viz; in not
using the plough in the culture, and in
not earthing, or but very slightly, the hills.
These results go to demonstrate, that the
entire roots are essential to the vigor of
the crops, and to enable them to perform j
Iheir functions as nature designed, must ,
be near the surface. If the roots nrcsev- |
i*red with the plough, in dressing the
crop, , plants arc deprived of a portion
jf their nourishment; and if the)' are 1
buried deep by drilling, the plant is par- i
iially exhausted in throwing out a new <
set near the surface, where alone they can 1
perform all their offices. There is an- s
atlier material advantage in this mode of !
cultivating the corn crop?it saves a vast 1
Jeal of manual labor."
The preceding considerations justify j
as in recommending, that in the manage j
inent of the Indian corn crop, the follow. ,
rur mips he observed, or at least nartial- ,
"? ' - -V?
so far as to test their correctness : ,
1. That the corn harrow and cultivator j
ic substituted for the plough in the culture I
of the crop. s
2. That the plants be no not hilled* or i
out slightly so?this not to prevent the 1
soil being often stirred and kept clean, '
arid, *
3. That in harvesting, the crcp be cut '
it the ground as soon as the grain is gla- (
ced.
Again, in reference to the system of 4
level cultivation of corn, Judge Buel re- y
marks: 5
" The experience of the last two years
oas been sufficient to admonish us, that jc
without due precaution, our crops of In- s
Jian corn wilj not pay for the labor be- c
stowed on the culture ; and yet, that s
where due attcntien has been paid to soil, ,
manure, seed and harvesting, the return
has been bountiful, notwithstanding bad s
seasons. Having been umlormly sue- ~
cessful in the culture of this crop, we feel
justified in repeating some leading directions
for its management."
I
"After-culture.?In this the plough
should not be U9ed if the corn harrow anil j v
mltivater can bo had and if used, should yl
lot be suffered to penetrate the soil more i s
han twe or three inches. The plough j d
ears the roots, turns up and wastes the i *
nanure, and increases the injuries ofjj1
irought. The main object is to extir-1 *
rate weeds, and|to keep the surface niel- {
ow and open, that the heat, air and mois-) "
ure may exert better their kind influences | e
ipon the vegetable matter in the soil, in
converting it into nutriment for the crop.
Vt the first dressing with the hand hoe, ?
lie plants reduced to four, or three, in a
hill, the surface is broken among the i e
plants, the weeds carefully extirpated, I e
and a little frash mould gathered to the
hill. At the second dressing, a like process
is observed, taking care that the I
earthing shall not exceed one inch and a i
half, that the hill be broad and flaf, and d
that the earth for this purpose he not tak- p
en from one place, but gathered from tho F
surface between the rows, where it has o
been loosened by the cultivator." s
As an evidence of the practical results h
of this mode of cultivating corn, I give tl
you, in addition, the statements of two b
other fanners of their mode, and of the ti
products of their laud. a

five and a half ac res, and have measured
1051-3 barrels ar d one bushel of ears, n
making 103 bushels of corn per acre. n
The corn is called Sea man's corn; it is a ^
deep yellow, and not a gourd seed, hut a ^
very deep grain and smiiII red cob, and P
has from twelve to twenty four rows on J1
the cob. I have taken great pains in se- J
lecting my seed far the last three years. ^
I threshed olF230 bushels last May, and
found from measurement from the barrel r
fine bushels and seven-eighths of shelled ''
corn. The following is the manner in s
which I prepared the ground, &c. The ^
soil is a stifT clay ;; one and a half acres v
of said lot was in clover last year, the c
balance in wheat. I out 205 two-horse '
cart loads of barn-yard manure on it: the r
manure was coarse, made out of straw. ^
corn tops and hu?ks hauled into the yard 1
in January and February, and hauled out ^
in Match and April, consequently was 1
very little retted. 1 spteacl it regularly ^
and ploughed it down with a large con- ^
clave plough,, (male by G. Cox, of Mid- s
dlctown, Delaware.) seven inches deep. ^
1 then harrowed it twice the same way it c
was ploughed. I then had the rows mar- *
ked oat with a small plough, three feet 1
ten inches wide, and one and a half inch- f
es deep. I planted my corn from 18 to '
22 inches apart, and covered it with hoes: *
just drawing the furrows over the corn, ^
which covered it one and a half inches x
below the surface. When the corn was ^
four inches high I har*owed it, and thin- ^
In
ncd it to twostnlks in the hill; in about r
two weeks after harrowing, I cultivated v
it: about the 5th of June I Itivated it v
again, which was all the tillage I gave it. 1
We farmers of the Eastern Shore count
our corn by the thousand : I had 28,640 s
hills on my lot, and I think my corn a
would have been better had I planted ^
earlier: I did not plant till the last of A- '
pril. I think the planting ol corn shal- j s
low and working it with the cultivator is g
much the best way, especially on clover ! s
ley. Is you think the above worthy of j I
notice you will please give it a place in h
your valuable paper." c

SOIL FOR WHEAT. 1
Whoa*, will not thrive, whore there is t
io lime in the soil. It may bo artificially |
pplied to soils destitute of it, and a tolera- j
le crop will be tnainainod, but this is j
arcing things to quite t?>o great an ox- I
ense. Thirty' years ago, wo never saw i
wheat stalk growing in tlie Old Colony, i
['here is no lime in the soil of that region.
lince it has been discovered that lime is <
ndispensable for wheat, many of the far- <
ners, in that region, purchase Thomaston j
ime, sow it broad cast on their field de- |
igned for wheat, mix it with the earth
>y plowing and harrowing, and in this
vay obtain a great rarify?a tolerable
:rop of wheat. But the application of
ime, as well as of manure, must be re- |
icwed annually, or no wheat kernels will <
ill out. We recollect that in September. <
.837, wc were in the town of jl/arshfield, i
tfass., and had the curiosity, whilst there, '
o visit the principaMarm of Hon. Daniel
Yebstor, once the old Gov. Winslow i
mmestead. As we approached the manion,
passing down the avenue to the
louse, we noticed a " large pawed" man
in our left, with a slouched hat and canass
or tow cloth frock on, marching first
his way and then that, with a half bushil
measure under his left arm, and with
lis right scattering air slacked lime over
lie ground, till it appeared quite white.
Ye paused for it few moments to chat
vith the old codger, as to the operation
in was engaged in, and to inquire if Mr.
Webster was at borne. It was Mr. Webster
limself. Fie was preparing his field for
vhent. Ho was very anxious to raise
vheat and make Graham bread of it; and
n this way he had met with some success.
Our soil in Maine is generally of a limetone,
formation, and therefore is natur- I
IIV adapted to the growth of wheat.?
Ye need not to scatter lime on our fields. 1
#ut there are soils of different consistency, <
ome of which are more favorable to the 's
rowth of wheat than others. We find it (
tatedin the Memoirs of the New York 1
Joard of Agriculture, that 4i wheat grows J(
etler on land that contains just as much ]
lay as can he combined with it, without !
objecting the wheat to be frozen out." 1
We inquired two weeks ago, whether '
be danger of frost to winter wheat, even 1
l our latitude, is greater on well selected 1
ications, Than tiie danger of spring sown ^
'heat, frcm the weevil, rust, mildew &e. *
a our opinion there should be more at- '
sntion given to the cultivation of winter '
'his is in hazard from nothing but the (
r
ost, and when itsucccccds, it makes a
ctter grain and a whiter flour. The lo- r
ation should not be in a low place, where c
le water will stand, but some elevated 1
r side-hill situation, where the land is
ry, and if it is where the snows natural- e
r drift, in, so much the butter. The fJ
uthor of the Memoir-above alluded to. ''
bserves?" Since it is the clay which
f>sorbs and retains most of the water in- f
irious in wheat soils, I adopted a rule "
>r the consideration of farmers, founded
i that principle, and confirmed by all the l'
nervations I have been enabled to
lake." His Rule is as follows : "Wash P
little of the soil in a tumbler of wafer,
id observe the time required for it to be- a
jme clear. If the time required exceeds e
iree hours, it may be considered that in ^
ich a soil, the wheat is liable to be in.
red by frost." This is a simple Rule, j1
isily applied by any farmer, who chooses
i make the right selection of land for
IliLX^I fTIIVUll J
Wheat that is sown the latter part of a
ugust or early i:i September, will have !
ne to extend its roots in the soil, and c
ill stand a better chance to retain its
>ld as the soil " heaves under the opera- a.!
>n of frost.
In relation to the depth the seed should
covered, Mr. Fcatherstanhaugh, in his
isay on the Principles and Practices of J
ural Economy, says:
* A grain of wheat when put into the
ound at the depth of three inches, un- 1
rgoes the following transformations as lL
on as the farinaceous matter which en- m
lopes the frame of the young plant eonined
within it is softened into a milky ar
ite, a germ is pusod out, and ut the or
ttom of that germ small roots soon fol- tai
v. The roots are gathering strength, 101
lilst the germ, hy the aid of the milky *u
id, is shooting upwards; and when the tfu
Ik is exhausted, the roots arc in activi- (hi
and are collecting novuishnjent for the cr(
int from the soil itself. This is analags
to the weaning of the young of aniils,
which are not abandoned by the ^
>ther till they can provide for themsclvUut
the care of nature does not end
re ; when the germ has fairly got above ltn
fho surface, and become a plant, a set of
Upper roots are ihrown out, close to the
itirface oflhe ground, which search alf
[he superficial parts of the soil with the
<ame activity as the under roots search*
the lower parts; and, that part of the
Term which separates the two sets of roots
? now become a channel, through whicb.
the lower roots supply the plants with tbtj
lourishment they have collected.
What an admirable contrivance to ee:ire
the prosperity of the plants? Two

We were informed'a few days since by
Mr. Williams, of Wallingford, that he
purchased in May last, thirteen Sheep,
?ach of which bore a lamb in December
[>r January last, eleven of which lambs
came to maturity for the knife, and were
butchered bv him. In June, eleven of *
!he same sheep again bore twelve lambs,
nil of which are now living. We believe
instances have been known of sheep hearing
lambs twice in the same year; but
we doubt whether another so remarkable
a case of fecundity in a whole flock is to

anticipated the birth of this second gene.

the first, hut would have exhibited the

WHY WILL MILLS GRIMU Bf >KE flf THE
RIGHT NHAN IN T1IE DAY-TIME ?
It is known to every miller, says a
modern who argues philosiphic&i, that the
valocity of water wh'^els is increased at
the approach of night withou t the volume
of water or aperture through which it
passes being enlarged. The solution of
this well-known and singular fact is found
in two distinct causes.?Water-wheel*
generally, are implied by the specific
gravity of water-?The specific gravity
>f water, in some measure depends on its
temjieraturc ; for instance, say water at
30 deg. weighs 61 pounds per cubic foot,
white at nogs, it weigns 02 pounds.
Supposing the temperature of water durng
the day to be 60 degs. and |40 degs.
it night, it follows that the specific gruviy
of water used at night, is 1-62 greater
han the water used during the day, conlequently,
the power, impelling water- .
vheels, is 1-62 greater at night than dayr
he aperture through which the water issues
teing the same. The volume of water
ponded in a given time is the same at
light as in day, but the weight of water
onsumed is greater at night than in day
:auscd by the greater density of water nt
light. '
The second cause producing this sinpilar
fact alluded to is, that at the apiroach
of night, the vapours suspended
ii the upper regions of the atmosphere
uring the day, descend and rest oil
he surface ol the water in forehays of
litis, and aid their weight and density in
orcing an increased quantity of water
hrough the aperture. Tho difference of
he specific gravity between cold atmoe
here charged with vapour, and air heated
y the noonday sun, is the pressure added
t night to water in forebays of mills.
