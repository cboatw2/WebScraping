Dec. 21. Mr. Lion of Missouri introduced
u bill to repeal the distribution act,
and moved to refer it to the Committee
on Military Affairs. At the suggestion
of i\lr. Calhoun and.others he, alter Nome
time, substituted a Special Committee.
A debate arose on the question of reference.
which lasted till half past three.?
Messrs. Linn, Calhoun. Pierce. Burbantin,
King, Barrow and Woodbury, advoeated
the reference and repeal; Mr. Pres.
ton also expressed himself favorable to
the repeal. ' Mr. Barrow insisted that the
| reason why the act passed at last session,
was a want of full discussion. The dis
I
cussion was left to the opponents of the
hill. If its friends had udvocatcd it, he
thought it would not have passed. Mtrssrs.
Mucguin. Rives, Archer and Prentiss opi
posed the repeal and the reference of the
i bill to any committee. Thoy snid the.
| proposition was a simple one, well under,
stood and requiring no investigation s
i The motion to refer was 'finally decided
i in the negative, by a vote of 17 to 24.
: The report from the Treasury Department

insurers of a number of sdnves which had
In-eii rescued from a wrecked vessel the

; Brit ioii port, and there emancipated; and
| that the company had tiie money to pay.
! They asked redress from Congress.?
1 Messrs. Calhoun. Preston, Barrow, King
I and Rives all commented upon the coo.
duet of the British authorities in this rase
i n nd in the rase of the. Creole. Mr. Rives
I considered the relation *>f the two conn.
| tries precarious, and the danger of war
great. Messrs. Preston and Calhoun
! thought differently, if this country should
| pursue a proper course. They Upecied
j justice from the new British /Ministry.?
! The memorial was refc | ud to the ComI
uiittee on Foreign delations.
j Mr. Preston introduced a hill on the
| old subject of the fine imposed on the
i laie Or. Cooper under the alien an sedi;

up the report of "the Secretary of the
