the Court,
The relators are the officer* of the State
i Hank in thw city, end chun to be exempted
from.ilie fines, imposed by law, on militiamen
ibr non-attendance nt batt iliou and regimental
musters. This chini is founded on
the act of 1810,11 Brev- 22*2, which declare;
the President, Cos liter, and Clerks ol thii
... * -r *
fNc * y&bt "
!?Uf?sme otlief shall be "exempted

The act itself presupposes a classification

are fixed and regulated by law, and constitute j
th- system of discipline; and the same Inn* J
win* whrh would lead to the eoocJiUMQ that j
one of these duties was an exception, w ?ut<l I

let us suppose that regimental masters was 1

The Counsel opposed to the motion, has,
with his usual candor and liberality, admitted
that s rowtructtoa, founded oh.the
phtftseofogy' or this set, would exempt the

It b a well settled rule of ecn.wrocfioo,
that a general expression is controlledbj .
