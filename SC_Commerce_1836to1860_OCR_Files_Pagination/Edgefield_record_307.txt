Tihe Court of Common Pleas erni
nated its session at this place, on Sat trday
evening 'last. The most important case
which was tried, was that of William B.
Villard, jun., for the alleged murder of
Marshall Lott. Several able Counsel
were employed on both sides. Messrs.
Carroll, . T. Wigfall. D. L. 1 ar I
and Burt. spoke for the defendant; and
Messrs. Wimuhish and Bell'uger, assisted by
the Solicitor, Mr.Cald'well.appeared on the
part of the State. We have not for many
years, been present at so interesting a fo
rensic display. The Counsel retaired on
each side, entered with great zeal and
ardor into the cause, and well did they ac
quit themselves. On account of -the -re
spectability of the connexions of the ac
.cused andi the-deceased, this case excited
unusual interest. During the .two days
which it lasted, a.large assemblage, parti
nlly composed ofiladies of the higiest stand
ing, attended, and manifested a deep and
lively interest. The charge was delivered
b.y his Honor, Judge Earle, with his usual
ability. The Jury retired, and after a short
consultation, brought in a verdict of
Manslaughter."
Fenale Industry.-Wo rer ntIv ren an

Northern editor asks, if there is another
such to be found in that State ? Un
doubtedly, there are other fair Georgians
equally ingenious and industrious. 'We

inanntbctured by -South Carolina ladies.
Employment of this kind, is most appro
priate and graceful for fcmalr. No lady
ehould think it -beneathi her, to do iwork
etiltable to hersex utw statin .- In ancient
times, ladies of the highest rnk, and evet
Princesses, were accustoettd to perform
light labor atnt; their attendants.
Homer, in his Iliad, describes the Grecian
and ot-herladies, as doiug vari-u, kinds el
vork. He represets Iector, the re
nowned Trojan chief, on parting with his
spouse, Andromache. to go to battle with
the Greeks, as saying:
"Now go, toy spotse. and spin thy maid
among.
For work, like this. to females dath belong."
Like a dutiful wife. Andromach- ihottglh
overwhelmed with grief, goes to her work.
The same great poet, in his Odyseev, re
presents Nausicaa. the daughter of Alcin
Gus, King of the Phencians. as going to a
river, in company with her hand-ntidens.
to tcash-the -robes of state, itt pr. pairatiotn
for her nuptialk. In this very praiseworthy
employntent, she is discovered by Ulysses.
the King of Ithaca, who had wandered
thither.
Nowv. we do nn: helieve that H ,merlin
tended to represent the royal maiden ats do
ing the work of a cotmmon washer-womaun.
Far from it. He speaks of her as wash intl
only the most elegant parts ot female apt
parel, such as ladies, in onrdlay, are went
to do with great propriety. The Lntin
poets also speak of the Roman ladies
as perfo~rming mtatny kittds of work. It is
needless to specify ihetm. Its the mid
dIe ages, and down 1o a later day, ladies
were in the practice of workittg en cm- I
broidery and other t-hings. Is it strange
that int ottr time, the ladies of Georgiat atnd
Snutht Carolina should work ! It is very
ungallant. not to say slandere, to chargei
t-hem with itndolence. WVe knew that

adoited:
REPORT OF THE COMmiTTEE.
Considering ihe importanice ol Agri
culture to the comfort, wcah h, prosperity,
andindependence ol the inhabitamits of-liis
State, it has beeti long a subject ofsirprise
to vour Comniittec, that it has hitherto
cotnimaded so little attertiin From .1he
mass of our population: and especially
froit our Legislative Assemblies, whoe
members for the last half century, have
been selected principally from the raiks of
its votaries.and followers.
It cattiot be disguised th3t Agrictl
tire furnishes employment and sttpport to
nine-tenths of our Cit izens: that it fttr
nishes the meins of footd and clothing to
all classes anl descriptions d boriety ; and
that it pays into the Treasiry ofthe State,
either directly or indirectly, the w-ho!e
amount of taxes, which defray the ex
pienses of the Government ; and vet that
an interest co vast and pervading, should
have been made, for such a series of
years, to depeud upon its own isolated and
unaided resources, cnnot IHil to lie tnatti-r
Iof sturprise and regret; that while otlier in
terests have received Legislative proiee
tiot and encourage-imet, this, the very
basis and support of all. should have been
41tndiously overlooked and im.glected. is dis
creditable to the wisdotn and patrionism of
tho4e.o whom the welfare and provperity
of the State, have betn heretofore in
trusted. Your Committee. are. -noti less
sensible of the tuct, tha tIe jriIipleg or
Agriculture, either as in art, or sciencA,
are but partially understood and practised
by the great body of our farmers and plan
ters; that there is a getieral wan of in
formation prevailing upon the subjects of
Geology, Chemistry, and Asirotomv,
sciences intintately connected with pri it
able Agricult-tre- that the very elements
of the earths and soils, their prolier ntix
tore and propnrtions. are hidden truths to
uine-tenthtsofotur platnters; upon a compe
tent knowvledge of which, depend all suc
cessful Agricuiltutre-a'id more, especially.
ylhe skilful cultivation antd amelioration of
the diffement soils. WVith a full kntowledge
of this state of things, youtr Conittee
cannot but entertain the hetief, that this~
meetitig participies largely in the deep itt
terest, which has becen oninifested thr oughi
the State, wpon the subject of the proposed
Agricuhnural Convention ; thlar it will mttna
imously concut in thte expediency of te
Cotnvention, and cordially utnite ini the ap
ptointment of a suitable number of Dele
gates, to represent this Distriet, as the
surest and most authoritative measure, to
wards the retmoval of the dilliculties and
grievances above set forth, atnd oif raisinig
the Janiguishintg state of Agriculrture to th:a
condition of usefulniess, honor. atnd pros
perity, to which it is legitimaitely entitled.
Therefore,
SResolr-ed, That this tmeeting cordially
andl entirely apiproves of the proposoed
Agrienitural Conve'ntion, and will atppoint
Delegntes to atteitd.

A letter f.-om our correspondent, at
Hamburg, dated the 24th instant. says:
I ha'. e the pis asure of inforning you,
that our ton%% n i, now free of disease. The
sickie"s has paaed oli, and health once
more reigns inur midut. Our Iriends are
now returning homte, and peace and pros
perity takes the place of gloom. To-day
our btrveets were croweld with wagons,
nod the merchants were busy filling out
the exten'ive hills of the planters. We
recci ed t his day about 600 bales of cotton."
Hamburg Railroad -A train of 34 ears,
coli ainitng 5,O bales cotmn, was brought
dtin ii on the railroad on Thursday. by the
new locomotive Robert Y. Hayne. For
a fen w% eeks; past, front J.00 to 2LO bales
oif cotton per week have been brought
down oni the road, and the company am
prepared ito take at least double that quan
tity onl freight.
Since i riiing the above, we learn that
the train of yesterday consisted f '39 cars,
luadeted with upwards of 600 bales; and
ihat a re (iiititon foren.ptv cars was made,
as the nunhers empletyed in the transporta
lion tit up freight, was insufficient to bring
down the cotton offiered.
-We are informed that the compuy have
not rvailed tlieutelves of their right to ad
vance the rate of freight at 50 pir ct.,
i hich the charter allows them, although
they have alhost the exclusive control of
.trasportation in consequence of the low
%iate of the rivers.
We hope s on to see the rich product of
our sitil pourin2 in from all quarters of the
t.urroiundiiea countr%,aud thus affording re
lieflo the pressing demand.. that have been
accu:ilating on the mercantile commu
nity, to an exte-nt hardly ever before expe.
rienced in this heretofore favored city.
