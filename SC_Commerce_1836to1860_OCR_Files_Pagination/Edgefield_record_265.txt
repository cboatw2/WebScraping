Faon FLoawaI-- gives us great pleas
tare to tate the arri'al at the seat ot Gov
crietnt of Major General Macomb, who
has succeeded in pacilyitg the Indians ot
Florida. and has made such an arratige
went with them as will ellectutilly ut aI
stop to the further eion of blood in that
Territory. The country to be occupied
provisionally by the ludians is bituated be
'yond all former settlements, and the cor
don of posts established across the penin
sula from New Smyrn to Tampa Bay,
will be furnished with a snficient number
of tro)ops to ensure the faithful observance
of the terms dictated by Gen. Macomb,
both of the whites and the red meti.
Lato despatches rceived fromn Fort

and the superintendent of adiino afliuirs,
Ueu. Armstrong0, had in pursuaunce of im

Snowing the slowness of the taaus im
performing any matter of national iimpor
tauce, I did not yield to the general belief
that none would attend to my nivilatiotn,
and I had the gratification to r'eceive a % is
it from a young chief of considerable im
portauce, accompanied by seven active
- .warriors. I explained to the chief, the oh
ject of my mission, telling hin that his
great father (the Presidtet) was sorry that
Lhere had been so much fighting between
his white and red children, and that for
their good he recommended to themt ;o
cease firing on each other,and make peace.
The chief expressed hirm,.elf grea tl. d.
lighted at the prospect ot peace. I told
-in that if the whole naton would reire
bAow Pease Creek, that iootilitits would
c.ase, and that they miht tenim i: e -,
until furiber arran..uents oamd tie ia-ie.
He again expressed hliis gladnest. al hear
ing what I said. and promised that lie
would take my commuicanion :u priadal
it around, being persuaded that it would
be well received by all his people. In a
few days, after; he collected a consilerable
party of his people, consistiiig of tnen, wo
mnen, and children, and paid me nother
visit. I repeated to him ii their presence
the same -talk," and they seemed all
pleased with it. I thea made fhetn some
presents, after which they departed ouch
gratified, for they were all in a destitute
cotdition, as to tlothing and other neces
snries.
On the 17th inst., Lt! Colonel larney
of the 2d dragoons, who had previonily re.
ceived my directions to open a roimnt
cation with the Indians in the southern
portion of the penintita, near Key Dis
cayne, arrived -i ith Chitto Tustenutace,
pricipal chief of the Semiioles, who had
been recently elected by a coumcil leld
by the Seminoles and Micasukies. Chit.
to. Tustcnug-ee espressed a great desire
that the business on which he was call
cd, might be speedily attended to.
Accordingly, on the next day a meeting
was held, comlposc(l of Chitto riustientig
gee,attentled by 0-clhc-Il *adjn. a brot her of
U1luo-Snake, who canie with him to wit
%ess the proceedings at the reqtuest of the
Council of the nation al llarlock-l idljo,
Chief of the Mickantikies in this section of
the country, rand all his hand that had not
been despatched by butt to call in the n r
riors who were ont in detacehed( parties.
After going through the usual ceremaOtines
among the Indians of shakin;: hands and
smoking, I explained to the me~etin:- who
I was and the object of my armissin aintotig
them, at which they imicdihately evmtteed
great satisfaction. [tb~en dictated to them
the terms of peace, which they readily ac
cepted, tmanifestin~g great joy on the occa
sion, and icy have since been dl:iine
and singiug according to) their faishion,. int
Laker) of friensishtip and peace it whihth
many of our otlicers joinecd them, all of the
respective parties being siatisfied. I be
enclosed general order, anntonemtg the
r esult of the conference, exhiibits thte terms
of peace. Under existing circumst mees,
I did not think it necessary to enter iwto a
formal written treaty, stuch an mnstrumenit
with Indians having but little hindhing ef
fect. Nor did I think it politic am this time1
to say any thing abotut their emigtrationt,
leaving that subject open to sneh future
arrangemeants as the Governmcnt may
think proper to make with them. Na re
striction upon the pleasture of the Governi
ment in this respect has beent imnposed,nor
has any encouragement been givetn to the
Indians that thtey wouldl he permtitted per
manently to remain in Florida.
There is every reason to believe that
wthen the Indians remainiing in Florida
shall learn the prosperous condition of
their brethren in A rkansas, they wvill at no
dist ant period, ask to be permitted to join
them.
I have the honor ?oo bo, sitr,

More Indian Butcher.!.-We regret to
E nd that the savages bave not butried the
hatchet in Florida, but are still at their
wurderons work.
On yesterday we were favored with the
perusal of a letter, from a young lady in
-Florida to her uncle in this city, which is
dlated the 29th ult., anad camne by the lo
rida, from Gatrey's Ferry. The letter
states that on the evetung previous, abiout
suuiset, a body of 1mline surrounded the
dwelling of a M r. James Osteen, at Aliga
t4)r, and shot him near his stable. He
wvas instantly killed. Atn uncle of the
writer's Mr. Semeoni Dell, who was in the
stable, made htis escape to the house. A
sister of Mr. Osteetn's was shot through
the left side and arm, but Mrs. 0. and her
children fled to the nearest neighbior's
hotuse.
Mr. Dell was now left in the house by
himself, aind seeing the lndiaus approach
.. ho picke un a stiek. )as he had no
gun) and pulled open the door-lhe lndans
then tied. On searching the house. how
e% er. he found a gun, when he returned to
the door and fired at the savages, who had
come ilup. They also fired and hit him in
the left side above the breast. The shot en
tered the left shoulder blstale, and was taken
out on ihe 39th. Mr. Dell was doing well.
One of tie indians had a white feather in
his head, and it was thought by the' settler,
th1at they were a party which they had a
fight with sone time before, at a place
culled the Natural Bridge.
After the Indians left Mr. Osteen's, they
proceedtd to the plantation of Mr. Asa
Iolerts, patt a quarter of* a mile from
Mr, O's.,- but that family iearitig tie re
port of ganus, had left lar Mr. Zachaariah
Robert,s place, where the Indians followed
and deq. royed all tlhe poor people had,even
taking their only horse.
It was thought that Mr.Dell had woun
led one of the savages, by their taking
the horse.
It is truly melancholy to record these
atrocities, and that atoo, after we had been
led to expect :hat the war was indeed over.
We fear no treaty call hind these wretches
-and that exterminmion alone will stay
their slaughtering-mercilesss arms.

Compliment to Ucn. Scott-In the pre
face to the Lecture on War,by Dr.Chan
ning, which has just been published by
Dolton and Wentworth of Boston, is the
following well deserved compliment to
Gen. Scott, the Pacficator, whose conduct
on a recent occasion, has given him addi
tional claims to the gratitude anJ respect
.f his countrymieu, and of every frieud of
humanity. Dr. Chauning says
*-To this drtinguished man belongs the
rare honor of unitine the military energy &
daring. with the spirit oI a philanthropist.
His exploits in the field which placed hinm
in the first rank of' our soldiers, have been
obsuered by the purer and more lasting
glory of a Pacificator, and of a Friend to
Mankind. In the whole history of the in
tercourse or civilized with barbarous or
half civilzed communities, we doubt whe
ther a brighter page, can he found, than
that which records his agency in the re
ioval of the Cherokees. As far as the
wrongs done to this race can he atoned
for, Gen. Scott has made the expiation.
In his recent mission to the disturbed hor
ders of our country, he has succeeded, Uot
so mtuch by policy as by the nobleness anl
generosity of his character, by moral ir.
fluences, by the earnest conviction with
which he has enforced on all, with whom
he has had to do, the obligation of patriot
ism, justice, humanity and religion. It
would not be easy to find aiong us, a man,
who has won a purer fame; and I an
happy to offer this tribute, because I
would do something, no matter how little,
to hasten the time when, the spirit of
Christian humanity shall he accounted an
essential attribute, and the brightest orna
ment in a public man."
Our Squadron in the Gulf of Mexico.
-The Norlblk Beacon states that there
will shortly be a very formidable squadron

co,-greater in number anti calibre of
squai-e rigged vessels. than perhtaps, has
ever beetn under the command of a single
otlicer. or assembled at a single foreign
port in peace. it the first place, the fri
gate Constitution will shortly be at Vera
Cruz. The squadron of Commodore
Shubrick consists of the flag ship, theMace
donian frigate, the Ontario. Vandalia, Le
vamt, Erie, Warren, and Natchez, sloops
of war. When the Constitution joins the
squadron, we will be able to frighten the
.Ml exicans as badly as the French did.
There must be some design in keeping
such a heavy naval force in the Gulf' of
Mexico.

The South Carolinian in publishing
some on dits by our Columbia Correspon
dent, makes the followint comment:
"And these are not yet all the changes'
talked of, in connection with the Bench;
nor all the 'runm -j' mingled with them
muany of which hint at desperate attempts
to revolutionize the political principles of
the State and people, and to bribe the Bar
into an indirect aid of them, through their
hopes of the vacant offices. Our faith in
the people of this State, places us beyond
the fear of such a result; but it may not
be amiss to place them on their guard, and
warn them to mark well the conduct of
those members of the Bar, who take an in
terest in such changes, or at lkast the most
significant of them.
-Our object, however, now, in calling
attention to this matter, is to correct tn
extraordinary error, in the statement that
Judge Johnson .will probably be elected.'
We entertain great personal respect for
Judge Johnson, who is undoubtedly a very
amiable and estimable gentleman; but, in
politics, he stands utterly opposed to the
great principles and policy of the State
and people-as much so, probably, as any
man within their limits. A decided and ac
tive opponent of the Constitutional Treas
ury system-an open advocate of a U. S.
Batk, and also, we presume, of Mr.Clay.
-it is notstrrus to suppose that the peo
pie of South Carolina, with these things
before their eyes, will so far forget them
selves, and what is due to their principles,
character, and State, and reputation a
broad, as to elevate this gentleman, how
ever respected by them perooally, to the
first office in the State. To suppose it, is
*a reflection on the consistency, firmness,
and virtue of our gallant people, (so long
and well tried,) which can only be account
ed for in the quarter where it appears, by
a supp.sition of haste on the part of the
writer, and the absence of due considera
tion."

"The On Dis which I gave you not
long since, seem to have produced some
sensation. I am sure that I attached at
the time, not the least importance to them.
They were given as mere rumors, and like
every other rumor should pass for nothing.
The remark that 'Chancellor Johnson will
probably he elected Governor,' was made
without any purpose. Thero is no settled
design, that I know of, in any party, or
set of men, to push him forward. Dis
tiigiuished as he is for his public services.

without distinction of party, speak of him
as a fit stucessor of our preseit worthy

have done with it.

John Quincy A dams.-Mr. Adams has
publishted a secotnd letter, on the subjeti of
abolition memorials and petitions. In the
extracts which we have seen, he treats the
abolitionists atnd abolition societies with
respect, but disclaimns all itnterference on
his ownt part with the instittution of slave
ry, ais it ntow exists in the Southern States.
Hie says, " I desire not to interfere with
the institutions of slavery, wvhere they are
established.-& would not abolish slavery.
without a dne regard to indemnify the
slaveholder for htis loss; and to avoid the
necessity for that, would begin the ptrocesu
with a generation yet unborn. I adhere
faithfully to the stipulations of the Consti
tution of the United States, which I have
pledged my faith before God to support;
and I can lend my hand to no project for
the abolition of slavery in. these United
States, without the consent of their tmas
ters."
Affairs in .England.-The Great W est
ern brought English papers of the 17th &
18tht nit. In the British Parliatment, the
" Jamaica Government Bill" has been vir
tually defeated. Thte vote, ott taking the
question in the House of Commonis, was
for thme bill, 294, against it 289; a major
ity so small, says a Lotndon paper, as to
etsutre its defeat itn the House of Lords,
if the Tories think proper to oppose it
there. Thurs has the attempt of the Mitt
istry, to esta blish negro supremacy, in the
colony of Jami~ica, been put down for the
present. Ina cotsequtence of this defeat,
the Mitnistry, which was of Whig politics,
all resignied on the 7th nit. In the House
of Cotmmons, Lord John Russel delivered
a sneech on the subIject. Much excite
ment afterwards prevailed throughout the
country. Sir Robert Peel received the
commands of the Queen to form a new
ministry-but after a few days trial, lie
found there was no chatce to form one
tnat would commaud the confidence of the
people. At the outset, a difference took
place with the Queen. It resulted in the
Queen sending for Lord 31elbourne, who
with his coadjutors were reinstated. The
louse adjourned to the 27th May.
The Great Western.-The Great West
ern, steam packet, arrived at New York,
on the 31st ult. The New York Com
mercial Advertiser says,that she made the
run from Bristol in thirteen days and eight
hours. having made the shortest western
trip across the Atlantic, that we have on
record.
LONG SPEECHES AND ESSAYS.
"He that hath knowledge, spareth his words."
Pros. ch. xvii. r. 27.
So saith the wise man, Judged by this
rule, how few men of knowledge will be
found! We lately saw a part of a speech,
by Mr. Hilliard, of the Alabama Legisla
ture, which filled upwards of seven col
umns of the Alabama State Iutelligeneer.
The Intelligencer is quite a large sheet.
The speech was in reply to a very long
one by Judge Smith, (which we did not
read.) on that most fruitful of all subjects,
-a National Batik. What a task it is to
read the speeches of some politicians!
We would as soon undertake to wade
through the interminable novels of Rich.
ardson, the ponderous romances of chival
ry, such as the Grand Cyrus, or the Cle.
lia and Cleopatra of Madame Scuderi.
'Tis very certain, that these old stories
would be vastly more amusing and per
haps as profitahle. Long speeches have
now become almost.universal in our coun
try. Many of our politicians think that
they must he heard for their long speeches,
and many of our editors think that they
niust be read, for their dull. interminable,
prosy articles. Never was there a greater
mnistake. Essays and speeches of this
character, are written in what Professor
Lieber humorously calls " the State paper
style." The same learned writer, in hisPo
litical Ethics, says, " Those who have a
right to speak, lawyers, legislators, minis
ters, speak too much. Luther found it ne
cessary to enumerate among the e nine
qualities and virtues of a-good preacher,'
as the sixth, that he ought to know when
to stop." It has been truly said, that
" brevity is the soul of wit." Condensa
tion is the perfection of good writing and
spe aking. Dr. Franklin, the Prince .of
American philosophers, anabihaps o' all
modern philosophers, was remarkable for
his conciseness, his clearness, his vigorous
thought, and at the same time the simple
heauty of his style. He never spoke when
he had ncthing say. He never indulged
in long periods and common-place politi
cal reflections, like many modern orators
and writers. With him, "sound was but
the echo to the sense." Every word told.
He wrote for posterity,.not for the hour.
His short but beautiful essays will be the
delight of the student, when the voltImin
ous documents of modern politmcians, will
be consigned to the tomb of-tho Capulets.

You say :) matters nt. who a man's father
mybe, if he himself be honest. You are sat
isfied of this truth, that many persons of integ
rity. descended from ignoble fathers, have lived
in the enjoyment of the highest honors.
In the reign of Augustus Cesar, the
proud nobilimy reproached the satirist Ho

never attempterd to conceal the lowliness
of his origin. On the contrary, he pro
claimed it to the world. He thought it a
sufficient distinction to be the favorite of
the wise Mecmnas, the beloved counsellor
of Augustus. What cared he for a long
line of noble ancestrors, if he had merit
enough to recommend liim to the notice of
Augustus, the master of the world ? He
was hut novus home, the maker of his own
fortunes, and in that, he gloried. Well
did he lash the degraded sons of Patd'cian
familiA who brought disgrace upon their
ancestors by their numerous vices! .In our
day, and in our country, where all are
equal, there are to be found aristocrats
who endeavor to pour contempt upon men
of merit who have rise'n from an humnblo
origin to posts of high dlistinction. An ed
