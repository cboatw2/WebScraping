Afr."ditor:-In the. discharge of my
duty at this place, my attention. was called
to a. group of persons who were all atten
tively, listening to the reader. The sub
ject matter was " That one wheeled Sul
key."- I very soon. discovered the paper
to be she -'The Camden Journal"-my
mind at once recurred to former things,
and I listened attentively to the remarks
of my friend S. N. T., as also the remarks
of yourself, for which you will both please
accept.my warmest thanks. And while
I recur to the past, I trust nothing personal
shall be considered, while at the same
time I ,be permitted to touch on, as I pro
ceed. 'After I had-finished I procured it,
(the Journal of the 30th uit.) I perused
it, and found that those who once derided
me and-with sneers and contempt ridi
culed my ;invention, are now making
"amende honorable" for the past, and
coming up'in a Carolina spirit to my help.
Wbirdi- sojourned with you, the happiest
days of my life would, have been spent
upon the classic ground of old Camden,
had it not have been that I ever aroused
the curiosity add doubts of those that -1
had ever -invented "That one wheel Sul
key." -But I met with obstacles altnoet,
insu'rmuutable-the frowns of the self
important the wisdom of self conceit, the
jeers and taunts of ridicule.-the. laugh of
the ignorant, and the. contempt of the
Lord-like aristocracy, which, together
with pecuniary embarrassment, drove me.
to --another section to .seek- protection,
respect and a livelihood. Had a contrary
course been pursued towards me by. those
to whom I allude, and 'a friend had been
found .who would have stood by me, and
have responded to wsy -want of pecuniary
means, it.would have enabled me to have
carried, out my intention, and 1 should
now have been confortably living upon the
result of my success. and.would now-ha.e
occupied the position to which I am enti
tied. That however is fortnnately passed.
and that I am the original- inventor of
The one t'heel Stilkey." ny future action
will .show.' 'Tis true, and I am proud of
it, that there was found by me many
liberal, high minded friends too, in the
community, who looked into this inven
tion-. with much interest, and many were
actuated by motives of curiosity, to all of
whom I neverrefused an explanation-but
alas, many- of these .were, like myself,
poverty was- their only crime-were it not
so. I could have procured the necessary
assistance and have completed my inven
.tion with credit and success amid all the
excitement, doubts and cavils of the wise
of that day.
I however c'oncluded that amid all the
embarrassments. and perplexities which
crow del upon me at that titte, that
"Sweetare the.usesof adversity,
"Which like a Toad ugly and venomous,
tW~ears yet a precious jewel in his head."
and I looked forward to that day. when I
should ride successfully over them, in
" That one wheeled Sulkey"-establish my
claims, and as it now is, dispute my right
successfully, with this.'aid "Reamington"
of Virgiuia. Now si, this vehicle was
put in Operation by myself in miniature,
tested by a friend -who no- sleeps from
accident at .Camden. originally from
" Charleston." ,About 3or 4 'months ago
I made a collect1in of such materials as
are necessary to again put this vehicle in
motion-but again was I frustrated by the
necessities of my dependence, and I left
to attend thte various courts contiguous to
the city of Augusta. WVhen one morning
after my return, on looking over the cx
exchang~e papers . perceived witht aton
ment that a "Mir. Reainingtone of Virginia."
htad carried outt may original design and
invention, "That one wheel Sulkey." I
imtmediately set down and addressed a
letter to my old friend J. R?. McK. Eq.
I was however, responded to by youtrself
nd "S. N. T." accoinpatnied with a
v'ery proper Editorial.
Sullice it, I have obtained "legal ad
vice" on the subject-my course is a
plain one-I shall dispute every inch of
grottnd with " Mr. Reamington" in due
time. T~he principle and inention of the
one wheel Sulkey is mine-the data of
invention atnd origin are witht me.
The causes for my ptrocrastimating its
accomtplishmtent are numerous and cogent.
Thie most insturat00ut able, unfortunately
for Mr. Reatnington, was my want of
titme as well as my poverty-andi still
while I nursed this invention with care,
and often sighetd for its accotmplishment,
1 have lived to see myself temporarily
anticipated by "ne who (perhaps) has
borrowed my original invention, in order
that he mightt drive off' withm the eredit of
leading, in order .hat I might overtake.
0f which.- I do hereby forewarn all
persons'ithroughout the United States thar
J am the original inventor of - That one
wheel Sulkey.~". and that it is my determni
Snation to test the merely "prima facia"
eviden.e of letters Patent (if obtained) ty
a proper course and appliation of tmy
rights and justice, to the Judiciary or a
higher tribunal.
-Yours &c. with respect.

* New York Lecislature.-Call of a C'on
t'ention.--This body adjourned on the
17th iuatant, after a session of more thatn
- nusual itereat and importanc, as far as
the number of Acts is concerned, having
passed only 387.
One of the most important bills of the
session, is the Erercise law, which author
izes the submission to the people of each
town the question of license or no license
-excepting, however, the city of New
York.-South Carolinian.
- Nsxw ORLEANS,.May 15.
The C'onvention.-The convent ion tFr
minated its labors yesterday, for although
the adjournment sine die will probably
-not take place until to-day, nothting re
mains save the enrollment of the Constitu
tion.
It was determined, that the new consti
tution should be published withijn twenty
dafs following its adoption, to wit-in N.
O . Bee, Courier, Bulletin, and Jeffersoni
an. and itn all the country- papers, and that
the-smof6$25 should be allowed for its
p iublication ini English alone. and $50 in
English and French.
. -Amotion having been made to reject
-the previsot-eqegting the Isegislature to
remove the seat of government at least 60
miles from' New Orleans, the President
declared the motion out of order, where
upon a long an'd animated.debate arose,
in which Messrs. Eustis, Grvmes. Penn,
Benjmin and Wadsworth, took part in
favor of the city, and Mr. M. Taylor on
the opposite side. An appeal from the
decisionof the chair was taken, but the
President was sustained by a small ma
jority. So it was finally determined that
the seat shall be remi'ved from New Or
leans, and shall not be fixed within sixty
miles of that dreaded city.
The Convention then proceeded to vote
upon the final adoption of the Constitu
tion. This.soleninity occupied about one
hour, as nearly every member considered
himself bound to specify at some length
the reasons for his vote. The following
was the result.-Yeas 55, Nays 15.-Bee.
The Weather.-During 'the past week
we have, been blessed with seasonable and
most abundant rains, which have greatly
improved our agricultural prospects. For
three days, although the sun appea'red in
his full splendor. :he air was so cool, as to
render fires and wintier clothing not only
agreeable, but actually .necessary to corn
fort, in the morning and evening. Our
principal field crops look promising, with
the exception of wheat, which is pretty
genera lly.injured by frost ahd drought.

By this -evening's tail we were put in
possession of the N. Y.JBxpress, of Tues
day last, containing the news brought b,
the Britannia, which arrived at Boston on
the day previuus. The dates are to the
4th inst. inclusive. The absolute state of
the Cottui market is not published in the
Express, but by extiacts which they pub
lish trum - Wilrter & Smiaith's' journal,
at appears that the Cotton imarset nas
advanced since our last advices one f'arth
ing per pound. rTe prices of Iri had
fallen. the political news contained
nothing relative to the duiterences between
this country and Great Brian, in fact,
fom the vies we take of tae Parlatnen
tary .proceedings received by the Bran
maa, the Oregon question has either been
laid over for further discussion, or dropped.
Perhaps, in our hurry to lay before our
patrons, such portion of the news as might
most edlect their interests, we may have
overlooked-sumethiang of importance, if so,
they aiy'depend upon it being attended
to, in ime for the next mail.

the relaxation of duties, the plentihliness

Sugar, Gollee, anti other great staple arti

and although the market has nut been
quite so brisk during the pat week, yet
wve believe there n~ill at piresent be no
great reaction.
The Cottn market has been bonyant of

LATE FROM MEXICO.
The New York Journal of Commerce
of Tuesday 3 P. M., has the following
intelligence from Mexico:
We learn from Capt. Baker, of the
barque Falmouth, which left Mantanzas,
May 9th, that-the English mail steamer
from Vera Cruz arrived at Havana 7th
inst., with despatches for Mr. Crawford,
the British Consul, advising him that the
boundary line of Texas .had been defined
and settled, and her Independence guaran
tied by a convention between England,
France and Mexico. Accounts by the
same arrival state that Santa Anna has
been reduced to the alternative of ten
year. banishmet, or a trial for mal-ad
ministration.
The above intelligence must have left
Vera Cruz on the 2d or 3d inst., which is
ten days later than our previous advices.
. This joint guarantee of Texas Indepen
dence, with a specification of boundaries,
is a more definite form of the proposition
sent to Texas from Mexico, some weeks
sinee, pe rpr. frigate Erudice. The Tex
an government objected to that proposi
tion. that it specified no particular bonu
dary ; but intimated that if this objection
were obviated, and a liberal boundary
specified, the proposition would- be pre
senten to the people for a:loption or rejer-.
tion, simultaneously with. the annexation
project. We presume the line has been
placed pretty far West, in the hope of
inducing the Texans to acquiesce; but it
will he in vain,-they are almost unani
mous for Annexation, and Annexation
will be the result.

ticularly itn the country, by a want ul that uni
formity of conduct amuong the metmbers of the
profession. nhich. is so esential to its main
tenattce. and leeling it to be the ditty of the
members at the prolesuion. to riemovc as far as
puissible.any cause whicia haise a tendency to
detract from the respectaibility, hotnor and dig.
mity of that profession, we feel ourselves sus
taitied tm calling the attention of the Phaysiciatis
of Edgefield District, at least to thne considera
tion of a subject which must be looked upoin as
one of the great causes itn producing the ef
tects above alluded to-the waiit of a regular
tee bill, a uniform systema of charges, by which
all shall be governed.
The digmity, the respectability and the honor
of the profession require the adoption of suach
a systeum, arid it is duo the people, that a fee
bill be adopterd in accordance with the times.
We. therefore, call on the practisinag Physi
cians of Edgetield District,to meet 'at Ld-'ge
field Court Hiousa,on the first Mounday iniuly
inext, at 2 o'clock, P. M., on that day to assemble
together in somce suitable room, and adopt
such a bill of charges as the times and circum-*
stances require.
After which, the meeting might take into
consideration ether subjects. And one which
will be well worthy of its consideration is,
the propriety oJ establishting a Medical Society
or Societies in Edgefield Dlistrict. 'rho utility
of which, if properly coouducted. both as re
gards advancing the science of Medicine and
the benefits to the community, inust be ac
kntowledged by all.
We flatter ourselves that the importance of
the subjects will be tsufficienit to induce every
member of the profession in our District to
take a deep inite-rest in 'the mieettng, and to at
tend, pre pared for the 'transaction of the busi
ness above nmentioned.
