The objection made, yth Btateo oth
Cifreina to the laws whi kahehas undertaken
to anuai, is, thatfthey were passed for1ite pimr-'
pose of protecting domesticindustry. "She dis
tinctly declares 'that she 'will. nor permit any
laws made for this 'purpose to be executed
within herlimits; and that if an attempt' -be
snade tocarry them into execution by force,
she will withdraw from the Union The Exe
eitive branch oftho Government of the United
States has met these pretensiins witha firmness
that becomes the official representative of a
great and enlightened people, and has deelhred,
in a public proclamation, thatthe laws'mutst and
will be enforced. The legislative branch of the
Government will-doubtless exhibit, in its final
action,thesame firmanddignified attitude which
has heen assumed by the President; buttliecom
nittee have learned, with regret, that a bill has
been reported by oneof the most imported com
mittees ofthe House of Representaivces,,and is
now under dicussiou in that body; the objects
of wiich seems to be to remove the danger of
acollision between the Government 'of the
United States and South Carolina, by granting
to the latter all that she demands. * *
The real object of the bill is obviously s' to
modify the laws laying duties on imported
goods that they shnll in no degree, or as little
as may be, niford protection to the domestic in.
dustry of the country. * * * F
Takin# in view the circumstances under
which it to proposed, would in the opinion of
thecommittee, seriously compromise the ditii.
ty and honor of the country. *
The pretence a!led ed by the - framers of the
bill, is the necessity of reducing the revenue, in)
consequence of the diminution of the .public
expenses restlting from the pnvnient of the
national debt. This is still more futile than
the other. If it be the object of the hill to re
duce the revenne, why does it restore the dit.
ties on ten and cof'ee I Are the framers oflthe
hill ignorant of the known and familiar fact,
that a diminution of the ditties on importation
generally, increases the aggregate receipts?
The effect of the bill, should it become a law,
would probably be, as your coininitee have al.
ready remarked, not to diminish but to increase
the receipts into the Treasury. The iamers of
it cannot le ignorant of this, and the real oh.
lect in proposing it must be 1herefore, of neces:
4ty. be dif'erent from the professed and osten
leono. * *
Considering the circumstances under which
it isofferrred, the bill amounts to a proposal to
-strender the rights and interests of' the whole
to the menacesofa single State, and tile pats
cage of into a law would seriously comprounise
thelonor and dignity of the government.
A few months only have elapsed since the
present Congress, with great consideration,
and after many months of long and anxious
deba te, passed an impost -law, which was to
take effect from and after the first day of next
larch, and which has of course not yet gone
into operation. No law has ever been passed
in this country, upon w&h the people at large,
or their Representatives, in due5ress have be
stowed more time, labor and aitontioC,thain up
on this. Two great Conventions were sucCes
sively held, msassesn of uiaterials in the itm of
reports and statistical documents wvere~ collec
ted, and months of de.%ate were employed in
bringing it to perfection. ft was a larw of re
ductnon-constructed on the professed princi
pie of compromise, with a viewv of satisfying.
by ever reasonable'concession, the discontents
of the sonth. It'tvas adopted by an unusually
larg and gratifying miajority, coimposeat or
tuoderate men ofnill parties. The repeal of a
law made with so mch labor anid Caution, be
fore it baseven gone into operation, is a mnea
enre which could obviously be justified only by
some very important politcal evenlt occurring
in the interval. It is a measure which, in the
natureof things, would never be proposed ex
copfinir as a consequence of some such chan~go.
The only evenat which has takeni phce since
the last session of Congress, that has any bear
inga all uu the subject, is the declaration of
th South Carolina Convention, that the State
secede from the Union unless the protecting
polic be forthwith abandoned. TIhe bill re
ported by the Coanittee of.Ways and Means
of the House of Representatives proposes the
immediate abandonment of-the protecting pol
.Icy. Does it require any argument to make it
appear that the report of this bill is one sf.the
resuitse.1 the South Casolina Counvetion -?
Does it reqire asy ,argumient to show that -the
.passage of such a bill,as reported nurder such
~ircumstances, into a law, wouild be as minon
aistent with the honor as it wvould be wtt the
interest of the country I
Your committee thing not ; and, conceiving
it to be of great importance that the opinion of'
this General Cotumt should be distinctly and
promptly expressed upon the subject, they res
pectfully submitted.

that the asneodanucy ofMr. Calhiud would

We do not see such resurlts growkingouit of

the ERSi will.not be injured, hut will be
benefitted by having created- for them a
wider market for their products, and the
chances of obtaining the whole cotton trade
of the wrrld. Only look at the necessary
result of an intert uption of the commercial
intercourse between this country and Great
Britain. The. interdiction of exports of
CottF)o from the United States to England
would of necessi'y, lead in a brief period
to a revolution in the maifacturing das
tricts of Great Britain-the utter prostra
tion of her trade. and the ultimate over
throw of the empire whilst to the nianufac

give the position now occupied' by Eng

From 'he information we ricein from.

Mr. Calhoun's great mitnd. w6are disposed
