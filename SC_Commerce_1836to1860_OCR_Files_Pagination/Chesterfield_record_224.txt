FAFTEMNG POKK, CURING HAMS, &C. 1
I am satisfied that it is " not good econ.
omy" to endeavor to make manure from .
hogs by keep ng them up in a pet). I am j
convinced that len bushels of corn, fed on a
clean board flour, will make as much good : j
solid pork, as fifteen fid on a dun:* heap? ! j
and with this additional recommendation, iu:
the pork is perfectly sweet and entirely Iree |
from that nauseous flavor which is so pc- .
culiar to pork k"pt in a filthly state, and
h iving their Ibod administered to tliem in J
dung or litter. The greatest care must be
observed* The hog is not by any means
naturally a dirtv animal.
I have noticed fivquent inqniri *s in the .
Cabinet as to t!iu best metnoJ of curing ,
|>ork and hams, i woul i inform a!! inquirers
that thev cannot have good, sweet meat.
+ 0 *
unless it is both good and sweet before it ,
goes into the tub. The host of salt cannot
make bad meat good?but v\iil prevent .
good meat becoming bad. In some parts of
the country where I have dined, the pork
served up at table has tasted so strongly of
the pen that I could not ''a' it. o.> ni ton .
lor making manure from hogs. I ;.ave always
had goo i pork and hams sua: I f <j ,

well cleans-ad. ,
On one occassion I purchased a l<?t of
.Jersey pork, 2.00J ponn s. Itwisiarnnd ,
very hatidsom lv drosso I, bat it lacked one ,
cssenti d requisite?tliat good fl u or which ,
character.-/ s a!! good pork. Subsequently, <
I bought a lot of 'd.otH'O lbs. raised in ;
Hacks county. The hogs were fed on a
, clean board floor, with Indian meal ; they 1 ]
had an abundance of water. No one could
desire finer or sweeter meat. A few years
since, I put up some pork fa'toned on sweet
apples, with tiie exception o! the last two
weeks, during winch tune tney were corn
fed ; and the pork was as sweet, solid, and
line us any 1 ever saw. The hogs roamed 1
ul large in ;ho orchard until { not them i*.j>

RECEIPT TOR CURING i'ORK AND IIA.'IS.
As soon as the pork becomes cool I cut
nod sort taking grout rare to have !h<*
tubs perfectly sweet and ci .-an. in cubing.
1 take out all llie spare rib;, mid make
pickled pork of all the side between she ham
and lite shoulders ; cu ing i: tu:o peees of
sui'able s:zo for family us'*. I trim the
hams and shoulders w? II. I cover the
bottom of the lubwi.ii ro d; sail, and then
put in a layer of pork, nicely packed ;
ihen cover this layer with su'r, and very i
bountifully. In six or eight days make u j
pickle of sail and cold water, Jns strong j
as possible, and cover the pork previously j
salted with if. It will tnrn Keep ior years
if you choose.
In preparing th~ l ams and shoulders* I
weigh several, to come at lac probable
weight of the whole. They .ire packed with '
great care in suitable tubs. My process
is to sprinkle some coarse salt at the
bottom, then pack in the haras and should-1
ers firmly, side by side, being careful not;
to put the back of one flat on the top of
another.?The spaces are filled up with
chines, hocks, and jowls. To about every
three huncred weight of meat I take thirty
pounds of rock salt, one pound of saltpetn',
and fourteen pounds brown sugar, or half
a gallon of good molasscss, [generally the
latterl. Take as much pure water as will
cover the meat, put it in a clean vessel,
add the above articles, boil it, removing
the scum as it rises, an J when no more
rises, set it to cool, after which pour it on
the meat until it is covered 3 or 4 inches.
If the hams are smaii,
12 to 15 lbs., let them remain in the pickle
live weeks?if from 12 to 21, sii weeks
?if from 35 to 45, seven weeks. Wheu
you remove them for the purpose of smoking,
put them in clean, cold water for two
or three hours. If there is too much sal;
or saltpetre adhering to the surface of the
bams, the water will take it off. The
smoke should be made of clean green luck.
<>ry. A fire should be built only in dry
weather. And when * the meat has nr.
quired a yellow tinge, not red or black
' they are removed, and bung up in a darl
place, whore they are not disMrbcJ by flie;
or vermin.

Great Value of Apples.?In the fal
of 1S35 (says Mr. Eleazcr Cady. of Can.
naan] I gathered about one hundred ant
fifty bushels of good sound apples of differ
ent kinds, and put them into my cellar, foi
lite purpose of f ediug them out to n?)
stock of cattle and pigs, to s?o what effeci
they would have. When hard weathe;
commenced I had two cows that gave milk ;
I put them into a stable, and commenced
feeding them with half a bushel of apples tc
each cow por day. I charged the boy tiial
milked them, to see if the cows increased
their milk ; and the third day the boy said
the cows gave almost double the quantity
hat they did before I fed them w.th the ap>!es?and
the young woman that had the
:harge of the milk, said that the butter that
vas made from the milk, at the time of
ceding them with apples, was of a fine
favor, and a fine yellow color.
I likewise commenced feeding them to
ny pigs. I fed abou: one bushel a day to
hirieen pigs, with a small portion of corn
?and 1 now defy the state to bring thirteen
is good as mine, that have had no better
; coping.
1 had gathered about five hundred and
iftv bushels of good apples, and put them
:ito a good bin in my carriage house, witn
ho intent of making them into cider ; but
itdbre I got ready to make them into cider,
ise cold weather came on, and ail my np>!es
froze. I immediately covered them
villi blankets, and they remained in that sit.
ration til: a thaw in the latter part of L)e. ember.
I then commenced feeding them
o my stock of cattle, which consisted of
wenty-two head and two colts. I fed
hem about ten bushels per day ; I soon
bund that my cattle would not eat half the
yuantity of hay that they did before I cornuenccJ
feeding them wkh apples?and
when the apples were gone I could see that
ny cattle had gained in flesh, and looked
jeilcr.

A survey and estimate of a ship chanr

It will be seen that the surplus funds of
he department, which atone time exceeded
1800,000, have been greatly diminished.
The determination of Congress not to reluce
letter postages, as suggesfed in my anlual
report of 1836, was considered in the
ight of an instruction to apply the cash on
land and the increasing current revenue,
o improvement of the mail service. It vu
stimuted that the 700 new routes establish
;d in 1836, and t! e improvements of service
on many old ones, in conjunction with
he usual annual increase of business in the
country, would add at least fifteen per cent.
0 the revenue far ihe lust year, which
would be maintained with n still further
ncrease during the present year. The or*
ension of mail service was accordingly
carried fur enough to consume this aqticil.
>ated increase, and ajso, 'D the progrt^S'jrt
1 few years, reduce the surplus on hand Jb
he lowest amount consistent with the convenience
of the department* The general
financial disasters of last year have not reduced
the revenue, as might have been ex.
pectcd, but have prevented most of tho aq.
ticipated increase, and threw the department
upon its surplus ^to sustain a large portion
of its extensions. The indicatioOsnow
are, that there will be a slight improvement
in the revenue of the current fiscal
year over he preceding, but not enough lor
produce any material effect. An advance
somewhat greater may be reasonably expected
next year, but not great enough to
meet the increasing cost of mail service, and
put into operation the new routes established
at the last session of Congress. It will he ore
be seen, that, for more than a year to come,
the curtailment, rather than the extension of
service, on routes now in operution, is to be
expected.

performed with the utmost fidelity and pre-,
cision. Indeed the world may be challenged
for any similar establishment, embracing so
much intelligence, activity, and energy,
and yielding to millions of mankind flo mach
unqualified good. The Chief obstructions
which it has recently encountered in i:s career
of usefulness, have arisen from the deficiencies
and unreasonable demands of corporate
bodies, which it had employed, or
deemed it useful to employ', in the publit*
service. . jii
managing its funds through the public
! agents, who ore under bonds for their aeco1
rity and removal at will, and in dealing with
; the individ iuI freemen of the Stute and of
i the United Stares in competition with each
j oilier, it finds all its operations easy, safe,
; and prosperous.
At their last session, Congress enacted
i "that each and every railroad within llio
i limits of the United States which now is, or
hereafter may be made and completed shall
bo a oost route, and the Pos master General
s!ial! cause the mail to be transported thereon,
provided he cao have it doue on reui
soaublo terms, and not paying moro than
1 t weary-five prr ceutum over and abovewhat
similar transportation would cost in,
post coaches."
To avoid further trouble with the rail"
i road companies on the main mail lines, it
j was determined to pay tlteca*. upon renewal;
; | of existing contracts, the highest price ;
which ih:s law woulJ admit. But there was
, 1 difficulty in fixing on- that price, (n the
) i first placs, it was to be ascertained what
