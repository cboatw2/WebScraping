Washington, Jan- 31.
When the Treasury note bill wad duly enrolled
and approved, to-duv, there was quite a rush
upon the pay agents for money. None of the
public servants were more anxious to get their
money than those who serve the people in Congress.
The members have received no pay for
a month or morer and were*, generally, much in
want of it
The death of Mr. Dixon, Senator from Rhode
Island, was announced in the Senate, to day, by
Mr. Woodbridge, whereupon the Senate, "without
transacting any business, adjourned, after
passing the customary resolutions in honor of the
- * ' take

place, to-morrow.
In the House, a great number of Executive
eormmimcations were presented by the Speaker, J
and were referred to the appropriate committees.
Some private bills from the Senate were read
and referred. This is the first time that the
Speaker's table has been cleared this session.
Mr. Cross submitted a resolution calling on the
President for information as to the commission
for running the boundary line between the Uniand
States and Texas.
Mr. Adams demanded that the House should
first consider and adopt the resolutions offered
<vv by him on Friday last, calling on the President
for certain information which he (Mr. A.) deemed
necessary to his defence from the charges
brought against him in Mr. Marshall's resolu.
tions. j
Mr. Gilmer asked if this would not delay the1
action of the House on the resolution he offered
on Monday last, censuring Mr. Adams for a contempt
of the House. Mr. Adams replied that
there would be no delay on his part; but there
might be some delay in obtaining the information
called for. Mr. Gilmer then objected to
the consideration of Mr. Adams' resolutions; and
Mr. Adams' claimed the floor to proceed in his
%v defence.
But, at this point, a message was received
from the Senate, in relation to the death of Mr.
Dixon, a member of that body. Mr. Tillingham
of R. I. then delivered a long and appropriate eulogy
on the deceased, and the House, after
adopting the usual resolutions adjourned.
It is now thought that Mr. Marshall's resolutions
for the censure of Mr. Adams will be rejected,
and Mr. Gilmer's adoptod.
Washington, Feb. 1.
No business was transacted in either House,
to-day. The funeral of the deceased Senator
from Rhode Island, Mr. Dixon, took place this
morning. The coffin was brought into the Senate
Chamber, at 12 o'clock, when divine service
was performed. The funeral procession was
then formed ar\d moved to the rail road depot
whence the remains of the deceased, were taken
to his residence in Rhode Island.
We have no news. The state of parties is
very much perplexed and confused. The President's
plan of finance will, as some think, still | r
find favor with the whig party?particular as it I
seems necessary, in consequence of the present J i
* oomo machine, as a fiscal J
DanK panic, iu t?wvii?u
agent, for the government, and to aid, in some
, degree, the restoration of the currency. The
House Committee, confiding in this impression ]
. N will report the fiscal machine of the President j
with little alteration. But I must say that there
is little hope of its adoption. ,
The resolutions of Mr. Clay, for the modifica- .
tion of the veto power, will probably come up in ,
the Senate, to-morrow, when Mr. Buchanan will ,
be heard in opposition to them. t
The President's drawing rooms will be open |
this evening, and an usually large company is ,
expected to be present ,

THE FLORIDA WAR. ,

FLORIDA, Jan. 29, 1842. (
This war has been so often over, and it has ]
been told to the world so often, and believed too, ;
that it requires nerve to say it is nut; for so i
many fondly believe what they wish, it is break- j

dents which prevent so desirable an object; but )
so it is, and we must submit calmly to disap- i
pointments, and hope for the best Now for the |
war. On the 21st inst Tiger Tail was left in ]
charge of the Tallahassians at Tampa Bay, (
during the absence of his brother, with euphonious
cognomen of Ne-o-lhlack-la-matkl-Ia. who
had gone up to the Withlacoochee with 27 war- |
riors to capture 0-ta-a-l;ee tho refugee Creek.?
On that night Tiger Tail made the attempt to ,
run off with this band; and he succeeded so far ,
as to run off himself, with three warriors and ,
four women. The vigilance of the guard pre- j
vented the balance from escaping, and among
those detained were Tiger Tail's squaw, and \
hopeful son, a boy of 15. This may induce i
Tiger Tail, it is thought, to return, If he
does not, it is not of much consequence, for he
has been much overrated.
On the 25th inst., Major Plympton, in com-;
mand of 80 men of the 2d Infantry, gallantly
encountered, under every disadvantage, lir.lleck
Tustcnnuggee, on the head of Hawk River,
which runs into Dunn's Lake, east of the St,

4 A AGRARIANISM.
^ THfre is a lartre class of persons in this coun- 1
r, try, whose existence sis a class is coeval with (
the existence of the Democratic idea; who at ev- i
ery movement, made or contemplated, towards t
f the attainment of the practical realization, of i
' that idea, cry aloud?"agrarianismStale as i
that word has become, it still has a potent influ- s
ence and by it, many an honest and earnest friend c
of Humanity is daily "frightened from his pro- r
nriety." Every honest hearted, thorough going c
Democrat in this country from Thomas J effer- t
son down, has in turn been stigmatised as an j
agrarian, and every measure wheih looked to i
the elevation of man to an equality with every 1
Other man, denounced as agrarianism. c
We fiad ne fanlt with the tww whoa rightly t
1
understood and applied. An equal distribution b
or rather division of intelligence, of political i;
power, and of social privileges, is in one sense r
agrarianism, and inasmuch as it is for these' that f
we live and labor, we are proud to be called t
agrarians. We would have toor the chances of f
obtaining property, equally distributed; and r
would also that every man might hare from go- i
verntnent, equal protection in the possession
t _ Ai i.? honestly acquire.? I
ana enjoy mum. m on ?
But when we coineto an equal distribution or <
any distribution at all, o{property, in behalf of i
those who hold property, we protest against it; |
and as an encroachment 011 one of the natural '
and inalienable rights of the individual, we de- <
clare against it in behalf of every individual, un- i
compromising war. I
The act of the last extra session of Congress 1
contemplates, as is expressed in its title, the j
"Distribution of the proceeds oflhe public lands." ;
The public lands are property?the proceeds of i
the sale of these lands is the same property, ex- 1
isling in another form. The Distributiou of 1
this property is ordered by the act under consideration,
and arbitrary distribution of property
is agrarianism in its worst form. ' 1
The public lands are the ucommon property" 1
of the States United,?not the joint property of j
the United States. We beg our readers to study 1
and mark well the difference; for in it is involv- j
ed the only rational exposition of the individual 1
State's rights to the public lands,or the proceeds <
arising from their sale. As States United, each 1
individual State owns a part of the icholc, whence 1
'the term "common property;"?and not the j
I icholc of a part, which would make them joint
\ property owned by each in the proportion which
each had contributed to their purchase. Under
j this view a Slate withdrawing from the Confed1
1 1 J..?4 ,l,!m fr, hPr n9Tf. Qf j.J,e ,
eration WOUia naveyiw i-miiu ? - ? r?._ __ _____
I whole, according to her proportion in "the gene- j
ral charge and expenditure." But if the other )
view be taken, and the public lands be recog- I
nised either as the joint or common property of -1
! the United Stales, it follows that a State with- J
drawing from the Confederation ceases to belong :
to the United States, and consequently loses her J
right, both to the whole of a part.or a part of the (
whole of the public lands or the proceeds arising :
from their sale. We have not time or room at i
present for a more elaborate exposition. t
Without enquiring how those Innds became j
the common property of the States U:-ited, we e
assume, and we believe, can maintain, that they i
are so. The change of form from earth to gold i
certainly does not change the fact of property,
nor the ownership of each individual State of its *
part of the whole, according to its proportion in '
the general charge and expenditure. But the c
Distribution Bill does, and takes what as Land f
is admitted to the common property of the whole ?i
in this proposition, and as Gold, distributes it in ii
another proportion, arbitrarily determined, and t
having no reference to this standard of estimate. 1
For a majority of the States to do this would be t
treason against the Union?for any one or more c
of the States acting 6eperately, to assert it, would t!
be nullification?for the Congress of the United >'
States to do it, is agrarianisin. G.

THE UNION. P
Will the freemen of this country uphold their / 0
Representatives in entertaining a proposition,
for a single moment, to dissolve the Union.? Sl
Dissolve the Union! Strange words to be c
uttered in a temple dedicated to the Union. Has ?
my of our readers ever thought of the effect of
such a dissolution. It cannot be that they have w
lone so: or such wordd would never flow from 0
their tongues. A6 the monster, death, leaves w
the human body, so will a dissolution of our bles- ?
icd Union leave our country. A corpse! a manfled
corpse for the wolves and the wild dogs to H,
jark at, and for the eca eagle to peck at as she
sweeps along her lightening course. Dissolve 'j

jattle rages long and loud around him. All a!

The British Revenue.?The Liverpool Eu- ..
ropean of the 4th instant, says: 1
"The revenue returnp, which will not be made '
up until the evening of the 5th instant, we have ,
reason to believe will present an increase in ev- ,
;ry department, except, perhaps, the excise. It [
is expected that in the customs there will be an
increase on the ynar of or about 100,000,/ whilst ,
the increase on the quarter, as compared with 1
the corresponding quarter of last year, will be c
about 400,0001. As the income of the country U
for the year ending the month of October last
was below the expenditure, there will not be any
/tnrinor tlm next three months in aid .
of the sinking fund. Depression, dulness and 8!
embarrassment have been the prevailingfeatures J"|
in nearly all departments of trade during the past
year, but a change, we are assured, is at hand rr
for the better, and we trust will be permanent.
The ruinously low prices that have ruled during ti
1841, not only for manufactures, but also for tl
many leading staples, give a better index to the r'
cause of these general complaints, than theactu- P1
al return of exports and consumption, for these ^
would lead to the supposition of prosperity. The ! *1
monetary system in England is beginning to as- ?'
sume a healthy position; the stock of bullion in
the bank now amounting to nearly one third of c<
the circulation." w
il
Whitney's Cotton Grin seems likely to be su- P1
perceded by a new machine for cleaning cotton cc
ind wool, which appears to have been introduced P<
with success at Lowell, Mass. The Courier of tr
;hat place gives the following account of it. 81
The machine has been invented and patented
jy \V. W. Culvert, of Chelmsford, and Alonso
Jrane, of this city. It consists of a common of
eed apron from which the cotton passes through fu
ho mllers and thence taken by a common picker et
ind thrown into comb-teeth arranged on a solid I ie
ron cylinder, and thence is taken forward under gi
i revolving floated wheel guard. The fibres of th
:otton are then doffed from the comb-teeth by
evolving brushes, and-turned out from all for- ri,
lign substances. The secret of the success of ct
his machine in cleansing cotton, lies in the in- In
fenious arrangement of the floated wheel guard, th
n connection with the comb-teeth. cc
* The advantage of this machine over Whitney's tr
:otton gin, may be easily seen. The latter has si;
iee? in use successfully ever since its invention,
mt docs not leave the cotton perfectly clean, and i
njures the staple in some degree/ With this i
nachine, there is no chance foreign substance to
>ass through; and the operation of it shows that i
he cotton is much better cleansed by it and with 1
ar less injury to the staple. Even cotton waste,
10 matter how much dirt ft contains may be perectly
cleaned and rendered fit for use.
The inventors have already taken out patents
ortheirmachine in Scotland, England and ner
colonies. One of the inventors is now in Eu- ,
ope, with two of the machines, which are now
orobably in operation at Leeds or Manchester.?
This machine will thus be brought to the notice
of manufacturers in Europe, and if they examine
nto its operation, the cannot but feel satisfied
fiat it is to theiT interest to adopt it. It is in:cnded
to take thje place of Whitney's cotton
jin, which has gained the inventor so much fame
md been so useful to the world, and with all the
marked advantages it possesses over that machine
it must necessarily do so. From its operation,
every one must feel sSffsified that it is a far
better machine than Whitney's.
The new machine has been in successful operation
at the mill of the Lowel Company for
six months, and has been perfectly successful.?
From rough estimates, it has been ascertained
that a three foot machine of this description, will
gin from one thousand to fifteen hundred pounds
of cotton per day, leaving the cotton quite elean,
and without any injury.to the staple. It has
been used aho for cleaning wool of burrs and
other foreign substances, and has operated with
perfect success.

France, Russia, Austria, and the other continentals
are willing to unite with Great Britain
to give freedom to Africa out of Africa. But
France will not (according to the late speech of
Louis Philippe) relinquish the dominion of the
sword in that part of it called Algiers. Nor will 1
England yield her foothold on the soil of that j

"Treaty of Five Nations against tiie ]
Slave Trade.?The London Spectator of a \
ate date says: 4An important historical event i
iccurred in London on Monday week, when the t
epresentatives of France, Austria, Prussia, s
md Russia, signed a treaty with Great Britain, i
n which the four foreign powers agreed to adopt c
he English laws against the slave trade.? j
Those laws declare the actual engagement in i
he trade to be piracy, and the embarking of (
apital in it to be felony. All the powers mu- 1
ually grant to each other the right of search j
ato vessels bearing their flag." c
The laws of Great Britain against the slave t
rade are but the copy of our own. Slave im- t
ortation was first inhibited, after a certain perid,
by the Constitution of the United States, t
nd the act of Congress made the slave trade a t
'atutory piracy. Tjie United States does not f

er the whole legitimate commerce of Africa,
ither than subject their ships, and sailors, and
lerchandise to British abuses in the shape of p
earches and adjudications. That Great Britain

How Great Britain executes her law against

THE CLOSING SCENE OF COLT'S TRIAL?THE
.VERDICT. * |
The closing scene of this extraordinary-drama,
exceeded in interest every other act of it
The Jury went about^ix at night, and remained
out ten hours. During that time a large mob
collected around the City Hall," and knots and
groups of persons assembled all about the Park,
discussing the probable verdict, and all the
facts in the case. Hour after hour passed by,
and the interest increased. All sorts of rumors
were afloat as to the position of the Jurors, and
the scenes in the Jury Room. The officers listened
at the key-hole and reported progress, and
it spread like wildfire through the crowd, that
the Jury stood seven for murder, three for
manslaughter, and two for excusable homicide.
Then, after discussing it an hour, they stood
seven for murder, and fixe for manslaughter.?
Then they discussed it another hour, they stood
ten to two? and there thev (seemed likelv to
stand. There were, in short, all sorts of rumors
about the vote in'the jury room, but nothing
certain.
In the mean time the Judge, had returned,
waited till midnight, and then gone back home.
Groups of anxious persons lingered about the
Coqrt room. The prisoner tirea and worn out
jave way to the impulses'of nature, laid, down
an a bench, threw a handkerchief over his face,
ind slept soundly while the Jury were deciding
the fate of his existence. The time?the place
?the circumstances?the solemn stillness of
the night, all combined tc form a scene not easily
forgotten.
At last when the verdict was agreed upon-^
:he Judge was sent for, and it was soon whiskered
about that it was fataL The prisoner was
iwoke, and his countenance fell. The Judge
ind Jury at last faced each other for the last
;ime?the prisoner was told to look on the Jury,
ind when to the words "How say you gentlenenT'ofthe
Clerk, the words "Guilty of Murler"
fell from the lips of the Foreman, Colt apkeared
horror stricken. His counsel, Mr. Mor ill,
ordered the Jury polled, and as they answerid,
one or two-burst into tears. The prisoner's
mart almost died within him. Morrill then ap>lied
to the Court for time to present* their ex
:eptions, and the Court agreed to meet this"
norning at ten o'clock, to hear them. Colt was
hen removed to prison, y
Now comes, then, the most exciting part of
he drama; will he be hung?or will a new
rial be granted? will the Governor dare to
iardon him? We think not. The verdict seems
o give general satisfaction. The public have
;ad their eye on Colt from the time of his arrest
ill this hour; and had the verdict not been "murer,"
we don't know what would have been the
onsequence. The public have been cheated so
ften, that Colt has to suffer for the sins of Ezra
Vhite Robinson, and all who have escaped for
lie last ten years. It is a very unjust thing?
tut so it is. We shall see what to-day will
ring forth.?N. Y. Herald.

an away from Mr. Shark, and was seeking

4 CONGRESS.. . / , s
Since the passage .of therTreasury note hill arid-;"
the fejecfion of the Bill repealing'-'the Bankrupt
law, there has been nothing of much interest
doing in either branch of Congress.
The House were engaged, at the latest d^ter-,
in discussing the resolutions censuring old Sir-,: .

The number, of prisoijers In the Virgin ia pen itentiary

of which 13 were females.- The earnings of f he"

' The review of new works -by Mr. id ^5
worth more than the'subsCripiion price of the -*

and interesting and wo think just.and impartial
We Jiotice one . query of Mr. PoE,rUpon that
work, however, which we answer"quit& satisfactorily
to ourself. "It may be asked,", say8; the.4
critic, "why the inmates of the Warren failed to
hear the alarm bell, which was heard by Solomon
Daisy?1" Now, we think, that the author
makes it very evident in the course of theqj^ry^'jV"
that the gardener was aroused, and that; it-was in
fact, the cause of his own death; by placing diim
on the watch, and in the very way'of the murderer.
The toliing.of the ChurchJ)ell,,by i^ib^ V?
mon Daisy immediately after that of the Warren ^
was calculated to allay any alarm which the
other inmates might have experienced. For, .
being- aroused from their slumbers, by the sudden
peel of Mr. Haredale's bell, they would ri..
form no just estimate of the proxhnityj|of the sound,
and supposing that they waited in aniioiig"
alarm for several moments, the tpllingof the.','
Church hell, must have immediately reassured
them.

A writer in the Camden Journal over tbe-signatureof
"Lancaster," asserts that'the editor of ' the
Columbia Carolinian is laboring under.some'\'
hallucination, which caused him to misconceive, *
&c. Poor Colonel, we never thought he was in
so bad a way till now. ; All the guns, pistols and
Alibeau canes, that should have "welcomed the
Colonel's offspring have been turned upon hipi
by the knight of the bean stalk. How are you '
off for pigs Mr. Journal? We've got an'old red
fox UD here that has never been Miicrlit vet:
i ?? . j
which we'll barbecue to your tarnal honor, if you
get the better of tliat argument 'Tis true that
a "dwarf may have a giant forhis friend and thus
be master of a giant's strength," hut-truth is ^
mightiest, as subsequent events will show. Ac- -'
knowledge the corn, and we'll treat on the
strength of it. '
The above wily paragraph is copied from the '"/?
last number of the YorkviUe Compiler. We ..
:ongratulate our friend of the Carolinian upon
so able a champion coming to his assistance,,and
relieving him from a controversy with our correspondent
Lancaster will, no donbt, discontinue
liis warupon the editor of the Carolinian while
lie is supported by so gallant a stpiire as the Hero <
>f Accabee, (or as he was once, more approriatey
styled, the knight of the sorrowful counteenance.)
The fact is, the Compiler roan hto ^ -;-,
mocked both ourselves and correspondent into''
he middle of next Christmas, and we should
acknowledge the corn" and call for his "treat"
f we were not afraid we should fare something
ike the editor did in one of his tramps from
Charleston, and "get disappointed."
By the by, we should like to know what he
neans by '.'Alibeau canes." Wonder if they'are
iny thing.iike the ones he wrote .so much about
n the "Bulletin." - .<
Our'Btock of pigs is pretty good,?and we
ve perceive that the good people of York
ille in their search for an Ass to preside
iver their printing shop, have not been disappoined
in engaging the present incumbent.
From the South Carolinian.
OUR CONSISTENCY, AGAIN.
"Strange, that such difference there should be,
'Twixt twcodlc-dum and ttvccdle dee!"
'Lancaster,' in the C; Journal, 6ays we mistook
lim, in saying his charge of inconsistency was
oropposing a change in the election of Governir,
ect, on the ground of Jetting very well
Jone, and at the same time advocating a change
n the Judiciary:?that it was for. "denouncing
,11 'change,'" in reference to the'election lex'
