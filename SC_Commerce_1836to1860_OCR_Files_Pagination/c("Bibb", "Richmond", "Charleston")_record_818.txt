~ ,; Denominational Education-—Immediately
upon the defeat of the Education Bill, the Church
men set about to compass, by voluntary efforts, the
v task which they could notaccompi’ih by legal com
pulsion. The most numerous and powerful of the
Dissenting denominations have determined not to
-be behind the Churchmen in this good work. The
Wesleyans have resolved to provide an educational
machinery upon a magnificent scale. The Com
mittee of their Association passed a series of reso
lutions in the beginning of this month, by one
of which they pledge themselves and their denom
ination to make an effort to eroct, within the next
. seven years, seven hundred schools in addition to
those they have already erected. Every denomi
nation which opposed Sir James Graham’s Bill,
pledged themselves before God and man to bestow
upon the community an education better than that
which the bill contemplated. Let the Indepen
dents, and the Baptists, let the Quakers, let all, by
whatever name they may call themselves, exert
themselves at once to redeem the pledge, to dis
charge the responsibility, which they assumed in
petitioning against the Education Bill. There is
ample .room and scope enough for all, without
trenching upon each other’s province.
It is pleasant to be able to believe that the reli
gious world is awakening, in good earnest, to a
sense of its high and all-important vocation. That
something of sectarian bigotry will be mixed with
denominational education need not be denied, and
need not be much regretted. The disease involves
its own cure.—Bradford Observer.

TO THE MINISTERS AND PREACHERS IN
THE M. E. CHURCH.
Dear Brethren.—I shall make no apology for
addressing to yon a few lines in relation to the
Quarterly Review. Though it is no part of my
official duty to make use of means directly to pro
cure additional patronage for the work, it will be
seen at once that I must feel a deep interest in its
continued prosperity and usefulness. I had deter
mined to say nothing through the press upon the
subject until I was informed by the Agents that the
subscription list had been fearfully reduced, by
striking off non-paying subscribers. Perceiving
that, under existing circumstances, it might be a
question, whether it is best even to continue the
publication; and believing as I do, and have done
for years, that such a publication is essential to
the interests of literature and ministerial improve
ment in our Church, I have concluded to address
to you a brief communication.
Of the character of the Review, so far as my own
share in it is concerned, it does not become me to
„ speak ; but that it has contributors, whose capabil
ities to write for the instruction of readers of the
most elevated taste, none will question. The Re
view has, as far as we know, met with the cordial
approbation of the newspaper press, and editors of
other Christian communions have repeatedly pro
: Bounced it “an honour to the denomination.”—
Many of the preacher* have given the etrohgeat.
evidence of attachment to the work, and have con
tinued to scout the idea that it may possibly be dis
continued by the next General Conference “for
want of patronage.” Still the effort which is ne
cessary to make it support itself is not put forth.
Now, dear brethren, what do you say? Shall
the Methodist Quarterly Review live ? or shall its
sun set for ever, on the close of the present volume ?
Shall it be said, that the M. E. Church, with her
four thousand travelling, and eight thousand local
preachers, and with the vast number of intelligent
reading lay members in her communion, cannot
I support a Quarterly Review ? May it not be 1
I Come up, then, brethren, without delay, to our help
Let us have, at least, two thousand additional sub
scribers before the General Conference shall as
semble, and the question will be settled.
Let it not be deemed impertinent in me to sug
gest, that certainly every delegate to the next
General Conference ought to take the Review, as
it will be rather awkward business for him to act
then upon the question of its continuance without
personal knowledge of its character. For many
reasons, all the preachers,—especially the travel
ling preachers,—should take it. There are num
bers of wealthy persons among the membership
upon whom the Review should be pressed. Many
in ordinary circumstances ought to take it, and
would do so, if they were only properly addressed
upon the subject. But 1 forbear. I have presented
the case in brief; and now let us have the answer.
Two thousand new subscribers to the Quarterly, be
fore the next number appears, is what we 88k. Shall
we have them ? Brethren, let the agents have a
gratifying response to this call; and, I trust, you
will be conscious of having done an important and
an-indispensable duty. Geo. Peck.
New- York, Feb 2,1844.
EXPENSES OF DELEGATES TO GENERAL
CONFERENCE.
To the Ministers in charge of Methodist Congre
gations.
Dear Brethren,—You will recollect that the
General Conference of the M. E. Church is to hold
its next session in the city of New-York, in May
next; and that the Discipline of the Church re
quires that collections be taken up in every place
toward defraying the traveling expenses of the Dele
gates to that body. The moneys thus collected are
to be carried up to the General Conference, put
into the hands of a committee, and divided among
the several delegates, according to the amount of
their expenses. Now, that these expenses should
be paid, all reasonable persons will acknowledge.
But hitherto the collections have never been suffi
cient to pay them. Once, it Is recollected, the dele
gates were sent back to their several annual confe
rences for one-half their expenses, and it is known
that some of these expenses have not been recei
ved to this day. This method of disposing of the
matter is unequal and unjust. For, first, the dele
gates from those conferences which are near the
seat of the General Conference will have com
paratively but little expense to pay, and the confe
rences to which they belong are, in general, the
most able. And, secondly, the moneys in the hands
of the annual conferences belong to the deficient
and worn-out ministers, and widows and orphans
of deceased ministers, very few of whom ever re
ceive the full amount of their very slender 'claims ;
and therefore ought not to be deprived of any part
of the moneys in hand : and it is cruel and unjust to
send men as our representatives to transact our
business and leave them to bear their own ex
penses. To remedy the evil, therefore, the
General Conference has generally drawn on the
Book Concern for the balance of these expenses
and this, it is acknowledged, under the circum
stances, was their only remedy. But the ob
jection, to a certain extent, will lie against taking
these expenses from the avails of the Book Con
cern, as these avails are to be paid over to the an
nual conferences, and by them applied toward the
liquidation of the claims already referred to. The
above being a true statement of the case, it is
humbly conceived that it is the duty of every cir
cuit and station within the limits of the Church, ac
cording to their ability, to raise their proportion of
all the expenses of the delegates to the next Gene
ral Conference, that the Book Concern may not be
taxed to pay them. And this is more imperiously
required at the present time from the fact, that the
times are, and a few years past have been, more unfa
vorable to the interests of this Concern than former
ly ; both in relation to the sale of books, and collec
ting its debts. It is hoped, therefore, dear brethren,
that you will give due attention to this subject.
That those of you who are laboring in the central
conferences will not think because your own dele
gates have not far to travel and will not have great
expenses that therefore you need not make great
exertions to raise moneys for this purpose ; and that
such as are in more distant fields will not suppose
because money is scarce, business dull, and produce
rather difficult to turn into cash, that therefore you
may depend upon others, or on the Book Concern,
instead of a prompt attention to this part of your duty
but that every one will exert himself to raise his
due proportion of the amount, for be ye well assu
red that the unfavorable circumstances of the times
is a very cogen- reason why a general, timely, and
determined effort should be made to meet these
expenses independent of the funds of the Methodist
Book Concern. Dear brethren, it may be thought
that in obtruding ourselves upon you in relation to
this business we are assuming to dictate in a matter
that does not belong to us ; but to this we will only
say, we do not claim the right of dictation, but
merely as your humble servants to stir up your pure
minds by way of remembrance respecting what we
conceive to be a very important branch of pastoral
duty, but which in the multifarious duties of your
office you might lose sight of unless your attention
should thus be directod to it.
Hoping therefore that your goodness will influ
nce you to pardon the liberty we have taken in di
recting your attention to this subject, we subscribe
ourselves, Your brethren in Christ,
G. Lame & P. P. Sandford.

THE COKESBURY FEMALE INSTITUTE.
Mr. Editor, This school has recently com
menced operations for the present year, under the
management of Mrs. A. E. Scott—a lady whose
high qualifications and experience as a teacher of
female youth are tested by the most satisfactory
recommendations of competent judges. My own
observations, though limited, have been confirma,
tory of these testimonials.
- Your readers generally need not be reminded of
the advantages of this place for health and society.
No situation in Carolina, can be justly considered
more fortunate in these respects. The history of
years of unexampled exemption from sickness and
disease, leaves no room to doubt the accuracy of
this statement. And while the Cokesbury Female
Institute, combine* all the rccormnendatione of
similar Institutions, it presents an additional claim
to the patronage of the public, in the reduced scale
of its tuition fees. This is rendered evident by the
following programme. The scholastic year is divid
[ ed into two sessions, and for the graduation of tui
tion fees, the school isdivided into three classes viz:
1. Orthography, Reading, Writing, Arithmetic, $6
per session or $12 per year.
2. The same as above, with English Grammar,
Arithmetic, Geography, History and Composi
tion, $10 per session or $20 per year.
3. The same as above, with Botany, Natural, Mor
al and Mental Philosophy, Astronomy, Chemis
try, Logic, Rhetoric and Mathematics, $14 per
session or $28 per year.
For Music on the Piano or Guitar, $15 per ses
sion, or $30 per year.
French $10 per session. Painting and Drawing
$8 per session.
Ornamental Needle-Work, $4 per session.
The charges for Music, French, Painting and
Drawing, and Ornamental Needle-Work, are .as
usual, extra when instruction in any of these
branches is desired.
The writer of this brief notice, is no further inter
ested in the Female School, than as a citizen of the
place, and a friend to the proper education of
woman. ' M. J. W.

Statement of the Charleston Cotton Market.
February 13,1844.
Our cotton-market remains in the most inactive
state, and but very little sold for the last week.
Prices are nominally the same. The late European
accounts just received, are favourable; but as yet
have had no effect on this market.
GENERAL INTELLIGENCE.
FOREIGN.
FOUR DAYS LATER FROM EUROPE.
New York, Feb. 0.—We are indebted to Cap
tain Lowber, of the packet ship Montezuma, for
London papers to the 7th ult, and Liverpool to the
8th, both inclusive.
Ship Wales, capt. Wells, from Manilla, for
Now York, with a cargo of Hemp and Sugar, was
lost in August in the China Sea.
The average amount of bullion in the Bank of
England from October 7th to December 30th in
clusive, was £12,855,000; circulation £19,098,000;
deposits, £11,751,000; securities, £31,067,000.
The Marquis of Westminster has transmitted |
a contribution of £500 to the Anti Corn Law
League.
The Tobacco Trade.—From the result of the
interviews had by deputations of the tobacco trade
with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, it is in
ferred that no reduction of duty is contemplated,
but that there will be an alteration in the excise
law affecting the article.
The Revenue.—On the whole the account of
the revenue, (to Jan. 5th,) is satisfactory, both with
respect to the quarter and the yea^
That for the quarter just ended exhibits an in
crease over that of the corresponding quarter in
1843 of £725,670, while, on the year just ended,
as compared with the preceding one, there is an
increase of $5,712,078; the revenue for the year
ending January, 184.'!, being £44,329,865, that for
the year which has just expired, £50,071,943.
The item which exhibits the principal increase,
as might be expected, is the income-tax, the re
turns for which, in the last financial year, were
only £573,056, while in the present they are
£5,249,260. Under the head of Customs there is
a slight decrease on the year, but on the quarter an
increase of £552,879; and the Excise presents
the gratifying aspect of an increase both on the
quarter and the year: on the former of £8,763 ;
on the latter of 387,5031. This leads us to indulge
a hope that the condition of our laboring classes, so
surely tested by the consumption of excisable ar
ticles, has improved, within the last twelve months,
and in still improving. We sincerely hope that
the stimulus which has recently been given to the
work of our artificers will not be without its pro
per effect on wages and its consequent purchase of
commodities.
The post office exhibits a trifling increase on the
quarter and a decrease on the year; on the quar
ter an increase of 2,0001; on the year a decrease
of 13,0001.—Times.
Constantinople, Dec. 17.—Serious riots have
for some time taken place at Mossoul between the
Kurds and the Nestorians, the latter suffered much
from their rivals. The Porte, on being informed of
this, and wishing to do justice to whom it is due,
as well as to ascertain the truth of the affair, has
just decided to despatch Kemal Effendi to Mossoul,
in the quality of commissioner, to inquire into the
events alluded to.
Ireland.—The process of striking a Special
Jury for the trial of Daniel O’Connell, commenced
on the 3d ult. On the 5th process was completed.
Great complaints are made that the Crown should
have struck off every Catholic that turned up from
the ballot-box, which is considered equivalent to
packing a jury, as the traversers will not be tried
by a jury composed entirely of Protestants.
Mr. Steele has given instructions to have Sir
James Graham, the Duke of Wellington, Sir
Robert Peel, and Lord Lyndhurst immediately
summoned to give evidence on his trial. Sir
James Graham is his principal English witness,
we believe, in consequence of the fact that Mr.
Steele was a member of the Birmingham Political
Union when the present Secretary for the Home
Department was a Whig. So decided is Mr.
Steele’s purpose of compelling these four minis
ters of the crown to undergo his personal examina
tion, defending himfelf as he did before without
counsel, that notwithstanding his perfect knowledge
of the extent of English prejudice at present
againBt O’Connellites and Repealers, ho will, after
examining Lord Plunket, offer to go to London and
take his trial before a jury of Englishmen if the
Cabinet Ministers should try to deprive him of
justice by evading coming to Dublin.
It appears, from the Dublin Evening Post, of ]
Saturday, that the Catholics are grievously offend
ed at the insult which they conceive has been of
fered to them, and that, in the course of the week
a requisition will appear for an aggregate meeting
of the whole Catholic body, for the purpose of de
nouncing this alleged grievous wrong.
Daniel O’Connell—Mr. O’Connell has been
making triumphant progress through some parts
of Ireland, previously to the commencement of the
trials. On Tuesday night, he arrived in Cork.
On the following day, a deputation of the citizens
waited upon him, accompanied by the Mayor, who i
invited him to attend a public dinner on any day he
should please to name, after his acquittal. Mr. O’
Connell said he would accept the compliment the
the moment Baron Pennefather would give his
permission. The accquittal depended more on the
sort of jury than on his guilt or innocence ; and, if
an impartial jury were struck the whole affair would
not last forty-eight hours.
On Thurday, Mr. O’Connell arrived at Clonmel,
where it had been previously arranged he was to be
entertained at a sumptuous banquet. He was met by
ail extensive procession and escorted into the town,
vvhere he addressed the meeting from Hearn’s
Hotel, giving them excellent advice as to their fu
ture conduct, exhorting them to be peaceable, and
avoid secret societies.
V* ' V: ' •
Mr. O'Connell, on bit health being drunk went
over the usual topics; the cruelty, injustice, and
weakness of England; the number of her enemies ;
the impossibility of her governing Ireland by force
or resisting her demands, and concludingas follows:
^ The period is coming when the income of Ireland
shall be spent in Ireland ; when the proprietors of
the soil will be resident in Ireland, and when no
man out ot Ireland should have an estate in Ireland ;
when our domestic manufactures will be encoura
ged by a domestic legislature, when our commer
cial advantages will be made available for the peo
ple; when the country that God had blessed more
than any others by the genial nature of its climate,
will be happy and prosperous; when Ireland, by
honest, peaceable, legal, holy, and sinless means,
shall pass from the night of darkness and bondage,
and shine forth one of the most glorious lights in
the world.” (Loud cheers.)
France.—On New Year’s day, the corps diplo
matique, the two chambers, the clergy, and other
public bodies delivered congratulatory addresses to
King Louis Philippe. The addresses were desti
tute of political allusions: but lauded the King in
the mostemphatic terms for the order and tranquility
of France and its increasing commerce and manu
factures ; and felicitated him on the marriage of I
his son, the Prince de Joinville. The clergy also
alluded wjjh satisfaction to the visit of Queen
Victoria to Eu. The King made suitable replies,
rejoicing in the aspect of peace at home and
abroad.
The Journal dee Debats announces, that Queen
Christina has determined to return to Madrid in the
month of February, nominally to take charge of her
second daughter, the Infanta Louisa, but substan
tially to aid Queen Isabella in fulfilling the arduous
duties devolved on her by the declaration of her ma
jority.
London, Jan. 16.—The first occurrence of the
Parliamentary year in France,—namely, the ap
pointment of the members of the Committee which
draws up the Address, has given the Ministry a
larger majority and a more complete victory than
had been anticipated by its most sanguine adhe
rents. Each of the bureau, or standing commit
tees, into which the Chamber of Deputies is sub
divided, nominates one member for the Committee
of the Address ; of these nine votes, seven are on
the side of the Government, only two on that of
the Opposition. M. Thiers, M. Tocqueville, and
M. Duvergier de Hauranne, were among the de
feated candidates.—Timet.
Spain.—By the last arrival it was mentioned
that the Spanish Cortes had been prorogued pre
paratory to their dissolution. This event took place
on the 27th December, and appears to have been
wholly unexpected by the members.
The Ministers are also said to have purchased
the adhesion of the Infant Don Francisco de Paula
by giving him a Colonelcy of Cavalry and each of
his sons a Lieutenancy in the Navy. These pro
ceedings have united against the Moderados all
sections of the Liberal Party.
It is now certain that Olozaga has taken refuge
in Portugal, as he entered Castello Branco on the
19th December.
London, Jan. 6.—Our accounts from Madrid of
the 29th ult. state, that Messrs. Olivan, Posada,
Nocedal and other Deputies chosen by the Moder
ado majority of Congress, waited, in the evening
of the 28th, on M. Gonzales Bravo, to demand an
explanation of the programme which the Govern
ment intended to act upou. M. Bravo assured them
that the Cabinet had no idea of violating the con
stitution, and that the session of the Chambers had
been suspended merely to enable the Government
to prepare various projects of law of the highest
importance,—such as those on the municipalities,
the provincial deputations, and the organization of
the National Guard. He added, that it would re
quire from twenty to twenty-five days to complete
those preparatory labors, after which, the Chambers
should again be convoked, and the Ministry would
demand, and hoped to obtain, a bill of indemnity
for its conduct. The deputation, it appears, de
clared itself satisfied with this explanation, and
withdrew_Times.
Liverpool, Jan. 6.—Cotton.—During the early
part of this week a very large business was done
both by trade and speculators, at an advance of
fully $d per lb. on the current quotations of Amer
ican, but during the last few days the demand has
been more moderate and very freely supplied, the
I week closing heavily with a very little improve
ment on last week’s quotation. In Egvptian, an
unusually heavy business has been done', partly on
speculation, at an advance of $d per lb. Brazil is
in- improved demaud, and more saleable at full
prices. Surat is in very active demand, chiefly on
i speculation, enabling holders to obtain an advance
of 1-8 d. The sales of the week amount to
64,320 bales, including 15,800 American, 2150
Egyptian, 150 Peruvian, and 540 Surat, for specu
lation, and 100 American for export
Our market to-day has been quiet, the sales not
exceeding 3 500 bales. These consist of 200 Per
nams, at 04d; 750 Egyptians, 63-4 to 8d ; 300
Surats, 34 to 4d ; and the remainder American.—
Speculators have purchased 400 Egyptians and
150 Americans. There is no change in prices.
8th,—To-day the market has been quiet,—the

FIVE DAYS LATER FROM EUROPE, i
New York, Feb. 8.—By a special and extraor
dinary express from Boston, which arrived yester
day afternoon, five days later intelligence from
Europe has been received at the office of the New
York Herald.
This newc reached Boston on Tuesday evening
by the Republic, a New York ship, capt. Luce,
which left Liverpool on the 11th ult. !
We have papers to that date inclusive.
According to all accounts O’Connell may be
convicted.
The State Trials were to begin in four days,—on
the 15th ult.
There had been a further improvement in the
wheat market.
Money continued abundant.
Cotton was again in the ascendancy. Market
closed firmly at the last accounts.
The Court has not removed to Claremont as was
expected, in consequence of the prevalence of an
epidemic in the house. Iler Majesty and his Royal
Highness Prince Albert remain at Windsor, and
have taken their usual out-door airings durino the
week. °
The Clyde brings home $236,490, $32,000 of ]
which are from Tampfto, and $40,000 from Vera ]
Cruz, to pay the Mexican dividend. The result!
are for merchants’ accounts. She also brings 4,661 !
ounces of gold dust, 3,024 ounces of silver ; and I
152 of platina; £1,463 in British coin, 186 seroons J
of cochineal, &c. I
Since the proclamation of June, 1842, a numbed
of the light sovereigns exceeding in amount
£10,000,060 sterling, has been withdrawn from
circulation. Calculating the loss on each sovereign
to be 3d, the total loss sustained by the public
would amount to about £125,000.
The weather in England had been remarkably
mild, apple trees in bud and blossom, together with
polyanthuses, wall flowers; primroses, and daisies,
in full bloom, may now be observed in almost all
the gardens in the neighbourhood of Lancaster.
Dublin, Jan. 7.—The Special Jury.—In an
swer to the carpings of the whole tribe of Whig,
Radical and Repeal journals, touching the “registry
of bigots,” as one of the traversers’ agents politely
styled the special jury struck on Friday, the Even
ing Packet positively asserts that the eleven Ro
man Catholics objected to by the Crown were, to a
man avowed and ardent Repealers, and therefore
disqualified to act as jurors at the approaching
Stats trials.
, Meeting of Parliament_Th* Dublin Ston
ing Post, contains the following“ We have gooc
reason to believe that soon after the opening of the
session a movement of a practical and concentrated
kind will be made in relation to the state of Ireland:
and the extraordinary events which have recently
occurred amongst us. It is stated that, Lord John
Russell is to bring the affairs of Ireland under the
consideration of the house, by a substantive mo
tion for inquiry by a committee of the whole house:
and that notice on the subject may be given in the
first week . of the session. Thus early, we deem
it necessary to urge the prompt attendance of the
liberal Irish members at the opening of the ses
sion.”
As a proof of the improvement in trade, and the
belter condition of the working classes, it may be
