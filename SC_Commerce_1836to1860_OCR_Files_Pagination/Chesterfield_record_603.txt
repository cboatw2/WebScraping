iitft'ofact*. Among the acts passed are
the following:
One extending the jail hounds to the
boundaries of the several districts. One
Ptaerxliug t!>? militia hiwii, arid restoring
Brigade Encampments. One to prevent i 1
citizens of New York from removing out | **
of the limits of the State sluves and per-'I p
sons held to service, and to prevent the
escape of persons charged with any a
crime. v
The bill from the Senate to restrai.p t(
the sovereign State of South Carolina
from appointing a person to receive the F
said State's share of the proceeds of the
public lands, did not pass the House.
That bodv substituted resolutions to the J
same effect. The following is the prin* ?
cipa! one of them : "
* H
Resolved, That this Legislature will
not appoint, and that the; Governor be
requested and enjoined not to appoint,
any Agent to receive such portion of t^e .j
proceeds of the Public Lands hs may be ^
appropriated to this State-, under the late w
Act of Congress. * .v
On this resoluti >n the vote stood 193 a
to 16.

Da', is, Dudley, Earle, Gavin, Gilmer, H

The other resolutions were abstract
propositions to which no objection was t
uade. I
Mr. Hkxry, of Spartanburg, we think, 1
:i trod need in the course of the session a |;
et of resolutions into the House, affirm* \
ng the right of the Legislature to instruct ?
Senators in Congress ; but after repeated j*
- ...... r
fforts to get a vote upon them,/ they
vere laid on the table to sleep the sleep c

FUTURE CORPORATION'S.
When the lull to incorporate different
Micieties was before the Semite, Judge
lager moved to amend the hill by adding :
i clause declaring all ror|w?rat.ons created .
?v the lull, and all to be hereafter created (
by the Legislature.', public cor|?orations, j
and subject to the revision and amend, i
ment of the Legislature." The amend. t
merit prevailed ; and in this form the bill (
passed both houses. A different provis- '
ion of law, iti regard to corporations is '
much more'called for by the true interest
of the public. As the" law now stands, f
the private property of members of char. ,
tered companies is not liable for the debts ^
of the companies. But there is no good ,
reason why men who associate them. I
selves together for carrying on inanufac. r
lures, commerce, banking, or any other- .
business, should not be liable for the debt.* ,
which they contract, if they ho tiiisman. [
