OUR BIRTH-DAY.
. Inscribed to Thomas B. Russel, Esq.
bv e diva an j. rcniTEU.
Our birth-day! years have wildly passed"
Since we have,ceased to welcome thee,
'Till even thy sk^'appears o'crcist,
And Lethe rolls his deepest, last
And wilderingf surges sullenly
Above a name once prized so dear;
Though it hath scarce an echo now,
Through mcmorv's ircasurc-cel s to beer
i
One lingering tone however low?
A| * . I
One voice, however faulleringly
It whispers o'er the sweeping tide ,
Of years may come, with sounds to waken |
The chords those joyous hours have shaken, ]
When glaiihess' self might only sway ]
The lyre, whose passion-breaths would glide
But with a mingled joy and pride, " ]
To hail our early natal day. f'Our
birth-day! Where arc now the wreaths I
That crowned in other years, that bright 1
And softened brow with as sweet breaths
As float around those halls of lights-? -Where
only such pure beings-dwell ,
As through some raptured painter's dreams ]
Weaving a deep, a hushing spell, (
As thrilling as unspeakable, <
With those resistless rapture-gleams, 1
Their spiritual halls that flush
With an undying glory-gush? I
And where are too, the rainbow hues,
That lit thy sky in boyhood's years?
Each leaf Oblivion's silent dews
Have darkly laved!?each ray in tears
Hath wiltlly lost itself!?and all
For which we would one hour recall
Of other days, is gloomed and shaded!
All, all their tints of beauty faded!
We deemed not in our early hours,
That birth-day suns could ever bring
Aught but a train of beams and flowers,
To wait upon its wakening;?
We knew not that a surge so wild
Could chafe the barque of manhood while
* -v The buoyant shallop of the child
But floated in one radiant smile,
And Heaven's sweet face seemed luringly
To tempt it farther still to sea.
Our birth-day!?Where the absent ones,
' Who twined thy youthful brow of light,
4 " And hailed thee in such soft, sweet tones?
Companions of our soul's delight!
And where the beamy eyes that then
Spoke rapture at each spirits shrine?
We felt not, since we moved 'niong men,
. Such moments as were only thine!
Yes! some have faded from the sphere
They lighted up with rays of love,
Scarce seeming, though tliev lingered here,
c- o ?
Less spiritual than those above.
And some have lived to gladden, bless
The altars reared by other hands,
While our's yet burn in loneliness,
Arid as each flame grows less and less
We, like the magicians of Eld,
But sigh above the broken wands
Our powerless hands had vainly held.
Our birth-day!?'Tis a saddened sound?
A lost tone of a lonely lute?
A breath of song that floated round
The minstrel lips now cold and mute?
A vanished wave that swept along
The goblet's brim in revel's hour,
When wild romance, unwreathed in song,
Breathed in the lyre's deep minstrel power?
An echo's lone and fearful swell
Tfct starts to utter but?farewell!
Sumter ville, Aug. iB'l'j,
"All for Lovn."?The strongest case
of love and devotion of w hich we recollect
11 have heard, says an exchange, is that of
a Kentucky gallent, wtio pot into a hollow
tree, where he lived a whole week, peep
ing through a knot-hole at his true love, as
she sat sewing bearskin petticoats at her
wind on'. '
MISCELLANEOUS.
From the Boston Christian Register.
The liberated captives oftiie Amistad.?
Intelligence recently received respecting
these Africans, for whom so great
an interest was awakened in litis pai l of
the United Stales, sadly disappoints the
hopes which had been cherished in regard
to their influence for civilizing and Christianizing
their country. The efforts made
for their mental culture and religions improvement
are proved, as it would seem, '

away. Letters from the missionaries, who I
accompanied them or. their return, as pub-1!
lishrd in the 'Anti Slavery Reporter,'|
state that they have relapsed into their! J
former habits; and become dishone-t, in*
temperate and dissolute. It was ascer- 1
tained that they had practised deception 1
upon those who hail them in charge; that !
the)* did not belong to Meudi, but to scve- 1
ral other and more distant tribes. Some 1
of them belong to the Kooss country, and '
Mr. Steele, one of the missionaries, went '
to confer with the chiefs of that tribe, with
the view of establishing a missionary sta- 1
tion there. But, as a preliminary to nc- '
goiiaiion, a present was required by the I
chiefs of two hundred gallons of rum, a '
hogshead of tobacco, and ten nieces of baft, I
or cotton cloth; which being refused by Mr. '
Steele, he was obliged to return to Sierra I
Leone.
Cinque, the chief, carried about here 1
and exhibited as a hero, honored, Haltered, '
ami applauded, round whom thousands 1
flocked for the honor of shaking hands,? J
who was presented with a splendid copy of
the Bible from Ex-President Adams just (
before his departure from this country,
?tw..i.n i,;.v?cr.lf tn have been utterly 1
Iiuo auwti ii ;miii.7v<* ?w __
unworthy of all this attention. On his ar- 1
rival in Africa he refused to be any longer 1
under the guidance of the missionaries, 1
treated them with ingratitude, broke away 1
from their control, and gave himself up to c
licentiousness. Mr. Steele, in his letter, 1
says?'if we wish to establish missions be- '
fond the boundary of this colony, (Sierra '
Leone,) we can do it much better without 1
these men than with then).' He speaks of j1
litem as an 'incumbrance' in the way of 1
missionary cfl'ort.

tmr Ji-jcittor:?In a:i account ot tuc ar-T*
est of Wiley Freeman, published in the '
Vcw Orleans Picayune, and copied in the #
Charleston Courier other papers through- 1
jutthe Union. Isee that Freeman attempts '
to excuse himself of the murder ofhis wife,
by saying it was all my fault.
That 1 may do justice to myself, and to I
her name, which this man now attempts to 1
soil, after cruelly murdering her, I deem 1
it necessary to give the public a short statement
of the relation in which I stood and i
acted towards both Freeman and his wife,!
and let the public draw their own conclusions.
Mrs. Freeman being a first cousin of
mine, and living most unhappily with her
husband, from the period of three months
after their marriage, at which time he took
offence at some trilling matter, anil near
lier most cruelly. 1 felt it my duty, under
the circumstances, to do any thing in my
power to render her condition better.?
Accordingly! I consented, at his instance,
for liim to transfer to me a sum of money
to be vested in property for the use and
benefit of his wife and children. After
this, I consented to be named by the Court
of Equity, as trustee of certain other property,
previously settled by him upon his
wife and children. I acted, in accordance
with these trusts for a number of years,
without liis expressing or manifesting the
least dissatisfaction; on the contrary professing
the utmost confidence, and greatest
friendship towards nse until a few i
months previous ti^his murdering his wife,!
when he threatened my life, because Ij
dared to sue him on several notes of long
standing. And that lie might injure me
expressed his determination of leaving aj
tract of land of mine, upon which he had
been living for throe ycaas, and of going i
to Ueorgia. II is wife, unwilling to trust
herself and children to a husband who had 1
become a beastly sot, and whose daily!
earnings scarcely sufficed to supply his !
growing desire for drink, refused to go, |
beyond the reach of help. For this he'
left iter, and never did he attribute to iter |
any want of chastity, until lie was confined j
in jail, for lie denied ever entertaining any j
such suspicion after lie was arrested the i
lirst time. And, because I dared to execute
the trust lie had confided in me many
years previous; and because I dared to render
to one, that asssistance, which she
ought to have received from him; and because
I presumed to give her that assistance,
which prevented him from murdering
her by slow degrees, lie attributes to
me "all" the "fault" of ibis horrid murder. :

BRILLIANT WHITEWASH.
Many have heard of the brilliant stucco i
whitewash on the east side.of the Presi- i
deni's house at Washington. The follow- i
iug is a receipt for making it,'with some 1
additional improvements learned by ex- !
perimeul: I
Take half a bushel of nice unslacked t
-OF
lime, slack it with boiling water, covering i
it during the process to keep in the. steam, i
Strain the liquid through a fine sieve or i
strainer, and add to it a peck of clean salt. *
previously well dissolved in warm water: I
three pounds of ground rice, boiled to n I
thin paste, and stirred in boiling hot, hall i
a pound of powdered Spanish wliiiino, and !
a pound of clean glue, which has been pre- ]
viiMisly dissolved by first soaking it well, I
anil then Iiiinginfr it over a slow fire, in a (
small kettle, within a large one lilled with i
water. Add five gallons of hot water to t
the whole mixture; stir it well, and let it 1
stand a few days coveted from the dirt.
It should he put on quite hot, for this purpose,
it can be kept in a kettle on a portable
furnace. It is said that about one pint (
[>f this mixture will cover a square yard i
upon the outside of a house, if properly i
tppligd. Brushes, more or less small,
may be used, according to the neatness of
llie job required. It answers as well as t
uil paint, for wood, brick, or stone, and is (
:heaper. It retains its brilliancy for many
pears. There is nothing of the kind (
hat will compare with it, either for inside {
ir outside walls. Coloring matter may be" *
put in, and made of any shade you like.? j
Spanish brown stirred in will make red or ,
pink more or less deep, according to the c
quantity. A delicate tinge of ibis is very
lrclty for inside walls. Finely pulverized
common clay, well mixed with the Span- j
sh brown, before it is stirred into the mix- j
:ure, makes a lilac color. Lamp black in J
noderate quantities makes a slate color, (
r'ery suitable for the outside of buildings.
Lamp black and Spanish brown mixed to- J
jethcr produce a reddish stone color.? |
k'ellow oclirc stirred in makes a yellow
rash; but chrome goes further, and makes j
t color generally estimated prettier. In J,
ill these eases, the darkness of the shade j
ivill of course he determined by the quan- |
ily of coloring matter used. It is diffirtill
to make a rule, because tastes are ve y
different; it would be best to try experi.
lients on a shing'i?, and let it dry. I have
jeen told that green must not be mrxed .
villi lime. The lime destroys the color,
ind the color has an effect on the white- i
ivash, which makes it crack and pepl.
When walls have been badly smoked,
ind you wish to liave them a clean while,
t is well to squeeze indigo plentifuiivUi
tT,"5-Wnterb vr.triTse." be- ,
ore it is stirred in tTTtrwuoie ilii'STure. (
If any larger quantity than five gallons
s wanted, the same proportions should be
jbscrvcd.
A Teetotaller's Sign.?As a newly
pledged Wasliinytonian was passing the
streets'a few weeks since, he was thus hailed
by an old rum companion.
I say, Tom, they tell meyouv'e become
a teetotaller.'
Yes,' was the reply, 'and I'm proud of it,
and wish you would become-^ one too. I
have been a drunkard, a loafer, and almost
everv thing else, for the lust three years, I
and thank God, it has made mc a maul
The companion hardly knew what to
say to this; at length he added in a jocular
manner?
'Well, Tom, they say you teetotallers
have a sign to know each other by?won't
you tell an old crony what it is?'
'Certainly?we have a most excellent;
sign,' said Tom, pulling out a double hand-1
full of half-dollars, and shaking tliem in
the face of his former companion, and said,
'This is the teetotaller's sign!'
This proved a knock down argument,
and the other promised to sign at the next'
meeting, for he liked their sign.
An Arkansas Girl's Lettkr.?The
following characteristic epistle was picked
op on the road a few days ago. It appears
to be from a young lady in Arkansas;
to her friend in the East:

The following letter was received by
he editor of the Kentucky Yeoman,
hrngh the Post-office:
Mr. Editor: Kin you tell how a feller is
;o git along these times, what's in debt,
tnd who aint got any money, no^roperty,

riends; and who are too honest to work,
md too lazy to Steele? If you kin, 1 will
subscribe for your paper,
A Deouaded Wretch.?The Jamaica
Standard and Royal Gazette, savs the
Nfew Y'-rk Aurora, contains a statement to
he effect that one H. Peterson, master of
he American schooner Fancy, at that
,iort, from New Orleans, behaved In the
nost disgusting manner to surne ladies on
joard, of high icspcciability, who were
liasscngers in his vessel. On their urrival
it Jamaica, two gentlemen, friends of the
adies, waited von the master, and obtained
from him ihe following statement unucr
'lis our. hand:
Kingston, Jam., 18th June 1842.
I, the undersigned (master and partownir
of the American schooner Fancy)
Jo hereby acknowledge that my conduct
towards the Indies and children who came
>ut with me as passengers from New Orleans,
was brutal in tfic extreme. I deep-ly
regret my misconduct, and humbly request
that they will accept of this my most
ibjcct apology, for treatment unprovoked
txyTfTIy Impropriety on their, parts, and
n l.if-l. T [hinit only have trri> ceeded
from my own natural uupiauiy. [
Peterson.
Witnesses; A.McMillan,Charles Mason.
To this is appended a statement signed
by three of the passengers* concurring in
the opinion Peterson so abjectly expresses
ol himself; and the affair concludes with
an affidavit of Peterson's in which he
sweure . thaijus declaration above is untrue,
and t|jat his signature was obtained
to it by Mr, Charles Mason, through fear
of bodily injury. It is scarcely possible
to believe a creature so abject a coward, as
to confess himself the guilty thing represented
above fur the protection of his
miserable carcass; though we can readily
supposed a creature who would behave as
rascally a*s he did in the first place, would
only act in character by signing the sbave.
Bult San.
Blindness.?A cure for blindness by
means of prussic acid, is announced in
Europe. It was suggested by observing
<r.^i nnnnln ivbn had (lied from the effects of
"""r"!""
this deadly poison,"had an unnatural bright*
ness in the eyes for some time afterwards.
Verv high expectations have been formed
of the benefits of this new remedy. It applies
not only to blindness, but to weakness
of the eyes and decay'Of sight, caused
by old ago. The prussic acid is placed
in a vial, and the vial placed upon the eye;
and so | owerful is this subtle poison, that
it produces its effect without any closer
contact.
Tolerably Strong Coffee.?A correspondent
of the Richmond Star says that
he is thriving well at a certain high school,
that is, as well as he can possibly be, since
l,?on,|
lie lives on rout-ll LMllici aim OUUI U,VMU,
and coffee so weak thai if you were to tie
a grain of coffee round your neck and
swim across the Potomac, then go a mile
below and dip up some water, shut your
eyes and drink both high school coffee
and Potomac water, you could not tell the
difference. That must be a delicious beverage.
A Perilous Situation.?The New Orleans
Picayune gives a thrilling descrip-J
lion of an escape from the fire which oc- '
stirred in that city on the night of the 19th
jit, in the boarding house ofMrs. Wade,
jn Poydras street.
At an early stage of the fire, the stair- j
,vay between the second and third stories
jccame enveloped in flames, and cut off
jompletely the only avenue of escape to
he lodgers upon the third floor. In a
itate ofdreadful constearnalion they rush- '
id to the front windows, on Tchnupitnolas ',
itreet, and tying sheets and counterpanes i
ogether, descended to the street. One!
ieavy gentlemen was lowering himself in '!
his manner when one of the sheets tore
n two, and he fell nearly half way from ;|
lie fourth story window on to the gallery, i
ustaining, however, no serous injury. |l
A more remarkable escape, however, i
f -V;
. . ~ ? v' '' ' 'r
then that marie by Mrs. Wade.. herself *'
from the burning building has never., hapi
pE#.ed. Sire had caught the alarm in time
to reach the street, but had lingered irt
search of her children, distracted with tin- &. %"
certainty.and terror, until her return by thd-^' ;r
stairs was rendered impossible* She wad
fioonaftcr seen upon the roof, <k theexciterneiu
that took place belQtv at this spectacld .
was immense. AJadder was swiftly elevated
in front of the houses but it was too short
10 reach the eaves. By this time the
dames were raging around the upper
ry, and ali^a'dy creeping upward throoglfr :^j
the roof. With almost miracplous expdsA-jjM
dition> considering the frightfd1;%tnergeni 4
- _.i : t I -- .Hr ,
cy ol llie case, anomcr jauucr was raiseu ^
Irom ihe first floor beam ofthe new build- ? ?
ing adjoining, which was placed directly
upon the top rung of the olher ladder, ^and
still did not reach the roof of the dwelling
by somfe four or fire feet. Yet from
perilous and fearful height the daring
man swung herself by means of a sheetr
reached the ladder and descended slowly
and safely down the trembling suppDrt to
the ground. She had not yet stepped A
from the last rung of the ladder wh< n the J
upper part broke,*" showing but too plainly
liow critical had b^en the danger she pass*
e<l! - The dangerous and uncertain vehicle of
descent was raised against the wait in a -J
most precarious posiljftliaSifid waa:'held byMr.
Wade himself,.yl
of prodigious strength preserved it from ' ? "
falling or sliding nway. It was a most exinordinary
and thrilling incident, which #
happily terminated in tnesafe restoration
of the lady into the arms of her husband?
Mammoth Cave in Kentucky.?tt "is * ,jj
asserted by a writer in the Journal^ off / *
Commerce, that the atmosphere of the- *
famous Mammoth Cave, in Kentucky,JiSS
(Jbaiities of the highest efficacy for -diseas- *
ed lungs. Dr. Mitchell, most of whose *
faimly have died of consumption and was
himself reduced to a hopeless condition by
the same desase, believing that iherrwttre . ,
restorative properties in the air of thYcteVe*
resolved to make it his residence for a sea- <5
son; and about the 1st of AptrjHie took up
his abode in th Star Chamber,'about a mile M
from liieenlraore, wnerene conunuea an;
til the close of June. He says, -that in -?
week from the time of going into tlfe cave >
B"' ??*?
1 I l^l1 * * ^ *j'
emerged from the cave, his health wad dd ***
far restored as to be able to ride eigteen ^
miles on horseback in one day. We give a|
the fullowingeXtract from the article in the
Journal, dercriptive of some ofthetpecir- ^
liarities of the interior of this remarkable
place:
"The atmosphere of the cave is dry?
and the temperature even and equal, I have
never known it to vary half a degree/
through the year, from 60 degrees ofFarenheit.
Combustion goes on well, lights '
burn clear?respiration is easy. Animal.
flesh will not putrify in this atmosphere,
nor will vegetable matter decompose:?'
Meat hung in the cave a few days, becoms .
so strongly impregnated with nitre as to
become unpleasant to the taste. The corn
cobs left by the oxen which were fed in the
cave thirty years ago, are now inja perfect V
state of preservation; the logs used for wa- i
ter-pipes are sound and good. Animal **<
flesh dries in the cave, and becomes hard.-.
At this season of the year, a very strong
current ofair rushes out of the moulh of*
the cave; in the winter, the current changes
and blows equally strong into the cave?"
A Scene.?A correspondent of1the Lan-^
caster (Pa) Inteligencer slates that he wad' ' "
present at a Camp Meeting in the lowetf
end of York county, on Sunday, the 24th ;
ult. and that between 11 and 12 o'clock in
the evening there was a thunder 6torai,
which, for rain and lightning, and. loud
thunder he says he never heard equalled.
The lightning struck into the camjx^gkl
killed three horses dead on the spotgPb*
sides stunning a number of the persons at
present on the occasion. The scene he
j describes as one of the 'most tarrific and ,
awful; the shrieks of the women, the
neighing of the horses, and the successive
peals of thunder, preceded by the most'vivid
sheets of lightning, made the whole
spectacle one of great and awful sublimity.
No person was hurt.
CONGRESSIONAL COURTESY.?We find;,
in the Fayetteville Carolinian a paragraplHKpil
from which we quote the following. :W;v
"In the recent debate in Congress, on
the Navy bill, Mr. Addfcuses the follow. \
ing genteel epithets t^Wfrds Mr. Wise.? ^r.
He calls him "a demon of hell,"?"a foul Jm
fiend"?"a false, base and corrupt heart.,.*!
filled with low and mean motives." Wisd^.*
retorts by calling Mr^Adams "a bull

writer for the papers of that city has been,
