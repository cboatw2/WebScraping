,11 i i i 'I " n SPEECH
OF MR. McDL'HftyEj
ON THE TARIFF.
[ IN S**AT?:, MA/ 30 and 31, 1844.
f ' * to conclusion of the tariff* debate, the question
t pending being oo the Finance Committee's resolutions
proposing to postpone indefinitely his
bill lor restoring ike tariff' to the standard of the
compromise act.
The special order haying bean announced from
the Chair,
Mr. McDUFFIE rose, and -c~
Hie u follows:
Mr. President: The hill which I had the honor
of presenting to the Senate t arly in this session
for reducing the duties on foreign imports,
has, for the Inst six weeks, been exposed to successive
discharges of heavy ordnance and small
ftrttts from the other side of the chamber ; some
of them assailing me in front, some in the (lank,
and some in the rear. I have borne these assaults
with as much patience and philosophy as possible;
but I feel that it is now full tune that 1
should return the fire. And though 1 may not
have the command of arms of so large a calibre
as those of the assailants, 1 am not without hope
that, from the strength of my position, 1 shall be
enabled not only to demolish their masked batteries,
but to drive them from the field.
In answering the numerous arguments which
have been successively advanced by senators on
the other side of the House, 1 shall, in all human
probability, address the Senate of the United
States for the last time on this great and vital
1 question. And, although I have not the slightest
L 'fttrjic itlUl ail^tlllllg \ x-tart noit uuvi trill let UlC
fixed and predetermined doom of tho measure I
have presented for the consideration of the Senate,
I feel, nevertheless, under solemn obligations to
my own immediate constituents, and to the peof?l*?
nf flio TTm?rt/l *? - * 1 * 1
t? ...? v..?vu uiuun ui large, 10 place upon
the records of our proceedings the grounds of my
eternal opposition to the principles of the protective
system, to remain there as a justification to
the country and to posterity of my own course,
and that of my constituents, in all the possible issues
which may grow out of this question.
Sir, I must say?because I feel and I know it?
that if the people of certain portions of this Union
submit patiently to this (so called) protective system,
as a measure of permanent policy, their inevitable
destiny is extermination ; and if they have
left one scintillation of that glorious spirit which,
in the various stages of our past history, has invariably
animated our ancestors, they cannot, and
willTtot, submit to this intolerable oppression.
In proceeding to answer the various arguments
, VtWrnrrocd Wf-tlio VinurtttiUlw oonntova on llir* a|Ka?
side of the House, 1 shall not proceed in the order
indicated by the succession in which those honorable
senators addressed this body, but iit the
order indicated by the subject itself.
Tho first question, then, which I propose to
consider, is the rise, progress, and present state
of the protective system, as presented by the
two senutors from Massachusetts. The senator
from that State who sits near me, (Mr. Choate,)
devoted, I believe, one whole parliamentary day
to what he was pleased to call a historical review
of the protective system as it existed during
Washington's administration, with the purpose of
illustrating the genius and character of that system
Mr. President, 1 must be permitted to say that
this historical argument presented by the honorable
senator was, perhaps, one of the most extraordinary
ever submitted to a legislative assembly.
I will not say-?as was once said by a distinguished
parliamentary debater?that the honorable se.nator
has drawn upon his memo for his wit;
I for, 6uch as it is, I accord to that nonorable gentleman
the full merit of originality ; but I must
be permitted to say that b# has drawn very largely,
if not exclusively, upon his imagination for
his facts. Indeed, sir, his historical review reminds
me very much of some of those critical reviews
of which this age is so prolific; you see
the title, and two or three sentences selected from
the text, to answer the purpose of the reviewer;
and that is all you are permitted to see of the
work which is the subject of review,
I am not speaking in the language of exaggeration,
sir. I am not drawing from that source
from which the honorable senator from Massachusetts
derives his revelations, when I say that, in
the whole course of the extraordinary exhibition
which he intended as a historical review of the
Crotective system, and during a speech of two
ours and a half devoted to that branch of the
subject, the senator from Massachusetts has not
disclosed one solitarv fact ealeulafrid
was the protective system of 1789, which he
holds up for our imitation ! ! Not only so, sir;
I he has not only to di?olo?? the material
facts connected with this protective system, but
he has deliberately rrfuted to disclose them, as if
prepared to suffer the pains and penalties of the
common law for "standing mute," rather than do
it. Indeed, Mr. President, if the honorable senator
will permit me for one moment to draw upon
his abundant resources, I will exhibit in fancy
work the result of his great historical labor. Ho
has spun and woven a web from his own imagination
about the texture of a cobweb, and produced
very much in the same way. He has then
stretched it in a quilt frame, and spangled it over
with scraps of all possible shapes, colors, and dimensions
; and having accomplished all this, he
had deliberately spread out this summer bed-quilt
before the Senate as a historical review of the
protective system, though it covers over and conceals
all the facts, historical and legislative, which
would show the form and dimensions of that system.
vNow,
as the honorable senator did not deem it
material to disclose the rates of duty imposed hy
the act of 1789, to show what the fathers of the
republic and the framers of the constitution meant
hy protection, I propose to supply what 1 regard
as a great deficiency in the labors of that honorable
senator. I understood him to say?expressing
the profoundest admiration for the wisdom
and patriotism of our ancestors, as evinced in the
act of 1799?that the tariff of that year was a
protective tariff, and amply sufficient for the wants
of our then infant manufactures.
And how did the honorable senator proceed 1
Why, sir, instead of giving us the rates of duty
iuqxiaed hy the act of 1789, he gives isolated?1
will not say garbled?extracts from the speeches
_1? I -1" .L- C--. O i
ui mvinwni ui me iirsi v^ongress ; ami amongst
others, he quotes the opinion of one of them, unknown
to fame, that the duties should be imposed
not only to raise revenue, but to give protection
to "agriculture, manufactures, and commerce,"
stated in that precise order.
The honorable senator then goes to Grub street,
and picks np a worm-eaten pamphlet, said to have
been written in North-Carolina, avowing the absurd
opinion that it would be wise to protect home
manufactures at whatever coat; for the mere absurd
reason that what shall be taken from the pocket
of one man, will lie put into the pockot of another,
and thus constitute a part of the wealth of
the country 1 Now, this would be a very appropriate
argument for the leader of a band of highway
robbers ; but 1 protest against receiving it as
a specimen of the wisdom or morality of our ancestors.
i confess, Mr. President, that when I followed
the honorable senator, hopping and skipping from
legislative debates to catchpenny pamphlets, gath'
'
E?v ?m7 ^ *
- .UJ'.J . L _t?
, i
cring alike from the (lowers and oftal of history,
I found it difficult to decide whether his labors j
more resembled fcbose oF a humrcfing-bird in a i
Hower garden, or a butterfly in a fount yard. The
honorable seintior referred to the tariff of 17b9 \
as the embodiment of the protective system. He*
said the protection afforded by that tariff was amply
sufficient; that tire great und wise man who
directed the deliberations of the first Congress had
given us a model statute?a perfect beau ideal of ,
the protective system; and holds uj> this beautifulj
specimen of the workmanship at our wise and
putriotic ancestors as the prototype and justification
for that gigantic monster?the act of 181:2?
that one-eyed Cycles, "vionstrum, horrendttin,
informc, ingots, cut lumen ademptum," into whose
voracious cave you tnay trace the ingoing foot- *<
steps of his victims, but never see a solitary vestige
to show that one of those victims has returned.
1 shall now attempt to shotf fthe Senate not
only the principles of protection involved in this
model tariff of 1789, but of the form and dimensions
of tho protective system as it was then established.
The average rate of duties imposed by
that act, and regarded l>y the honorable Senator
from Massachusetts as sufficient to give ample
protection to our infunt manufactures, was 7i per
cent, upon all that class of commodities to which
Alexander Hamilton refers, in his celebrated report
two years afterwards, as coming within the
purview of the protective system. I will now
proceed to make a few specifications.
The duty ipppsed upon woollen manufacture
(the grant nHclevs of this protectivfe system. ?inoe ,
mo wooitens Dill oi 1S2Y, which my friend from
Virgiuia [Mr. Archer] then so ably exposed and |
denounced in the other branch of Congress) was
only fi per cent, in 17S9; less thunone eighth part
of the presoht duty.
The duty on iron and iron manufactures (that
interest which my friend lrom Pennsylvania [Mr.
Iluchanan] is always prepared to defend, being
ever on the ulert at every sound that indicates
danger) was also five per cent. ; about one twen
ucui pan 01 ine present duty.
And cotton manufactures, which are now subject
to rates of duty ranging from 30 to 150?the
actual imports of such as are not excluded averaging
50 per cent.?-then paid only 5 per cent.,
raised, however, in 1790, to 7<J per cent.
But, subsequent to the passage of the tariff of
1789, during the administration of General Washington,
and up to the war of 1S12, various other
acts of Congress were passed, increasing the rales
of duly. And it is a remarkable fact, to which 1
call thu particular attention of the Senate, that althoueb.
it* the preaiutiW tkv, ? ?.?. -* kw,
was declared to be "for the sbpport of government,
for the discharge of the debts of the United
Stutes, and the encouragement and protection of
manufactures," yet, in all the succeeding acts, tho
principal increase of duties is upon articles of
luxury not manufactured in the United States,
and it is indicated by their titles that the increused
duties were to raise revenue for specific purposes.
The act of 1790 was entitled "an act to raise an
additional sum to discharge the public debttho
act of 1792, "an act to raise revenue for defending
the frontiers against Indian depredations;" another
to defend our commerce in tho Mediterranean
sea against the Algerine pirates ; and so on
throughout. In no single one of these acts is
there any allusion in the title or preamble to the
"protection of manufactures ;" from which it is
a legitimate inference, that the duties imposed by
the tarilf of 1789 were regarded as the full measure
of protection to manufactures. But with all
the additions made up to the period of the war,
the duties on manufactures aid not avorago 15
per cent.
But the honorable senator from Massachusetts
seems to regard protection as a sort of.paetaphysical
entity, entirely independent of Um rate of
duty, and depending upon the motive of the le
gisiuture. He, therefore^ considers 7^ per cent,
an ample protection in ^789; because certain
members ot? Congress and the preamble declared
it to be designed as well to protect manufactures
as to raise revenue. But he regards the bill on
your table, imposing duties four times as high, as
denying all protection whatever, because the duties
are horizontal, and called revenue duties!!
If the senator will consent to reduce tlic present
duties from 40 to 50, to 5 and 74 per cent., he
may entitle the law a protective tariff, as it certainly
will be, as it was in 17S9, to the extent of
the duties imposed. 1 acknowledge myself indebted
to the scnutor from Massachusetts for calling
my attention to the debates on the tariff of
1789 ; and I recommend every senator to read
them who wishes to draw lessons from these pure
and primitive fouatains of wisdom aiul piurior-'
ism. During the whole progress of the debates
and proceedings, no one thought of a rute of duties
as high as 10 per cent, ad valorem. And
when a duty of G cents a pound was proposed on
manufactured tobacco-?which could not have
exceeded 124 per cent, nd valorem?it was pronounced
to be prohibitory. AVhat pigmies were
our ancestors in their simple notions of a protective
system and the blessings of high taxes ! And
what a rail road progress have we made in the
mysterious arts of taxation and plunder !
One of the duties proposed in 17S9, wus a duty
of six cents a gallon on molasses; and so vehement
was the opposition of Massachusetts. ?bat
the debate on this item occupied nearly annnch
time as the whole of the other items, an d Mr.
A mo. > .I TT- ^ . .
?-6 voiiuj iiiintiitru mat ine union would
be endangered ! And finally, although Massachusetts
did not proceed to the extremity of nullification,
she had the duty reduced to 21 cents a
gallon.
I should have been surprised ut this: but. T
find, from a review of the history of Massachusetts,
that she has always been more sensitive to
taxes imposed upon herself, and exhibits a more
philosophical composure in bearing the burdens
imposed upon others for her own benefit, than
any State in the Union.
iVIr. Mad ison, in the course of that debate, distinctly
avowed himself the advocate of unrestricted
commerce, and laid down his doctrine almost
in the language, and with the very illustrations, of
Adam Smith. When, therefore, he and others
spoke of protection to domestic manufactures,
they evidently meant that incidental protection
which would result from moderate revenue duties.
such as were imposed by the act of 1789.
And when Aloxander Hamilton?who ,3 justly
regarded as the great father of the protective system?in
his celebrated report of 1791, labored
through some fifty pages to demonstrate the policy
of protecting domestic manufactures, shall we
not look at the rates ftf duty he recommends to
ascertain what he meant by protection. There
was no one recommendation of' a protective duty,
over 10 per cent.; particularly upon that class of
manufactures to which he referred, as being entitled
to protection. Upon the whole, then, I confidently
affirm, that the provisions of the tariff of
1789, the debates upon it and the report of Alexander
Hamilton, all concur in condemning the tariff
of 1842, instead of giving it the slightest conn- '
tenance. By what strange philosophical deduction
the senator reaches the conclusion that 5,
and 10 per cent, afforded abundant protection in
the infancy of manufactures, when capital and la- 1
bor were scarce, and the country had neither machinery
nor skill, .and yet that a duty of fifty per 1
cent, is now necessary, when we have abundance
