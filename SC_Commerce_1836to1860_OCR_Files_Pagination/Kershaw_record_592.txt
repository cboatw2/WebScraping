"[SEWSEiflES.] VOI,. II. CAMDEN, SOUTH CAROLINA, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 1, 1841. NO.39.
GOVERNOR'S MESSAGE, NO. 1.
j.. Executive Department, )
^ Colombia, Nov-23, 1811. \
follow Citizen? of the Senate
and House of Representatives:
I congratulate you on the recurrence of
this occasion of assembling in the service
*of your constituents, under circumstances
as auspicious to the useful discharge of
.VoUr duties, as I trust they will he conducive
to the harmony of your deliberations.
While, in the general hf?aIth of our
'citizens, and the abundancp of the harvest,
i niMinl beneficent
Ve have experience.! mc ?
distribution of the blessings of an . overruling
Providence, we have not less cause
for congratulation in the reviving prosperity
of our people. from the Unexampled deipressoui
and embarrassment of the times..
Already has credit began to regain confi.
deuce ami stability?capital to seek permanent
investments?commerce to pursue
its accustomed channels?property to resume
a fixed and reasonable value?and
the energy and enterprise of our people to
embark with new and invigorated hope,
in its various employments, and pursuits.
Not the least gratifying reflection mining
from these cheering auguries of our
condition, is derived from the consciousness
that they are the results, not of any
pampering patronage of the Goverment
?not of the artificial stimulants of Legislative
aids or interference?but of a wise
a lit! vigilant economy in the people, awakened
bv the disastrous experience of the
pnst, to improve the permanent and enduring
sources of their prosperity. If some
of the lingering effects ofthe late derangement
in the monetary affairs of our country
are still painfully experienced, in the
reduced value of property,?diminished as
it must be from the inflated standard of a
depreciated and expanded currency?or in
the difficulty of discharging debts, incurred
in the flood-tide of extravagant prices, and
a redundant circulation?they are to be
regarded as the unavoidable consequences
of former errors and delusions, and perhaps
the surest indications of a progressive
state of convalescence and improvement.
Nor have we less cause to exult in the
hope, that our Government may now be
regarded, as having passed in security,
through the most trying and difficult exigencies,
that ever tried its virtue, or tested
its stability.
In the events of a single year, the sudden
ascen fancy of a party, actuated by a high
wrought enthusiasm?impelled by the disasters
of the times to seek relief in change,
and rashly imputing them to the conduct
of our Rulers?1seemed to threaten the
subversion of the well-estabiished principles
of '9S and *99, and of the republican
policy of the Government, as well as the
overthrow the exponents, by whom they
were administered. But a few weeks ex
perience of power, have as suddenly disbanded,
dissipated, and resolved this magnificent
array of party power and organization
into its distinct and original elements.
The deliberations of the late Session
of Congress have dispelled lite delusion
of party-zeal and fervor. Its impracticable
expedients and distracted councils
have I trust, again gathered and assembled
the Republican p irtion oflho nation,
in th ? unity and strength oCone fold,
and one conviction. And if the great
measure of "deliverance and liberty," important
as we still regard it to the faithful
as well as equitable administration of the
financial affairs of the country, has been
repealed, inform and in name, we have
still the unquestionable assurance ofitsfinaI
success, in the overruling necessity
resulting from the signal failure of every
other substitute or device.
Among these abortive expedients, none
was regarded with more intense and absorbing
solicitude, than the proposition to
re-establish a National Bank. On no occasion
has the exercise <>f the conservative
power vested in the Federal Executive,
been received with warmer approbation
hi.- the neonle of ihis Slate: or been more
?J f I? wisely
ami fortunately interp?>se?l, to arrest
the most dangerous, ami obnoxious,
of nil the premeditated violations of the
Constitution. _ Of all the great measures
of national policy, productive of the bit
lerest contention among the great parties
of this union and which lias always and
justly been rgearded as f-aughl wi.li the.
most powerful influences (for good or for
evil.) on our political institutions, the establishment
of a National Bank, is certain,
ly the most obvious and important, if
such has been the experience of the conntry,
in the primitive and purer ages of
the Republic, under the regulations of a
Bank, arising out of the embarrassments
of the^r.sf war. and the exigencies of the
last?of comparitively limited capital, and
directed by the wisest and ablest officers
?what were we to anticipate from an institution
organized as the instrument of a
party then in power?operating amidst
the ruins of a disordmed currency, and the
wreck, weakness, and dismay, of State
k. and local institutions. The expiring struggles
ofthe late United Stales B^ok to perpetuate
its existence against the fiat of the
people, and the constituted authorities oi
the country, are recent in the recollection
of all of us, and form an important epoch
in the history of our Government. Doubt4
fill as that contest must he admitted t" ^
have been, waged even as it was against '<
an Administration, perlnps the most efli- ?
cient and energetic that has ever conlroll- d
ed the destmes of this nation, what were ll
we to anticipate, when our Rulers them- l'
selves should have become its allies, its l'
party, or its pageants. In this view, it 11
would have changed the character of our IGovernmenf,
become part of our political c
institutions, and consummated the greatest P
of all the deprecated evils that could befall c
a country?"the union of purse and sword, l'
in the Federal head"?or worse, in the M
hands of a Federal party. Well may ''
such an institution be supposed to have b
had the power to regulate the currency; but
it would have been witli the iron rule of ii
despotism?restraining all interests, ah- 0
sorbing all capital, meastiiiug all profits, c
overpowering all competition, and attract- r
ing the wealth and prosperity of every h
other portion of the union, to the centre of 'I
its operations. i<
It was an honest confession, of one of
the ab'ect presiding officers of the late Uni- c
ted States Bank, before a committee ap- r
pointed by Congress to investigate its af- (|
fairs, that it was at any time within its pow- y
er to crush State and local institutions!? |;
What an appalling fact for the contempla- (j
lion of the Sovereign Slates of the Union! ,|
What a prophetic warning to the institu- p
lions chartered by their nuth itity! The a
institutions of the country to he uprooted i
and erased at the bidding of a heartless, v
soul-less.cent, per cent, calculating cor- (|
j)oratifin! The rights of the Slates, and c
the liberties of the people, to be subjected e
to the dominion of a sordid monied An- t
tocracy! And yet, such is the supremacy f
over law, liberty, and the constitution, to r
which such an institution would inevitably t
have attained. Encroachments upon the i
liberties of the people, in other times and j
nations, were to be apprehended from the \
, swords of conquerers, and the usurpations |
i of ambit ous rulers; but experience has i
shown that in our own age and country, r
. the strongest contests to maintain consti- j
, tutionai, and even sovereign rights, have <
been waged against an ambitious money j
power, in all its various forms, of Bmk r
monopolies, and protectee tariffs. Well r
" . . 1 . .1. _
tnereiore, may we congratulate me conn- r
try, on having escaped the ambitions pre- t
tensions of an institution which after im- i
perionsly dictating the humiliating duly r
to the Federal Executive, of violating his (
constitutional obligations, now threatens, <
through the vengeance of n disappointed (
party, the rash and iniquitous retribution
of abolishing the most useful and conser- g
vative, of all the prerogatives of his de- j
partment. t
The revisi ?n of the duties on imports, jl
justly regarded by the people of this State z
with a solicitude proportioned to the bur-|
dpns which the Protective Policy hashith-1c
erto imposed on thi m, has been made, nei-1
ther in that spirit of equity, .or of compio- ir
misc, which we had just reason to antici- 1
pale, from the pi incipies and concessions i f
of the Act of'33. The history of the op-i '
position of this Slate, to a Tariff for pro-js
lection, can neither be obliterated or for-ir
gotten. And the high considerations r
which actuated her, i? consenting to corn-/
promise her interests, for a term ol years, ^
to the peace and saftty of the Union, i'
should be a warning, as well as an induce, i
ment, to respect her rights, as well as her ^
forheara ce. While the government is f
acknowledged to bp disembarrassed of (
d? bt, and manufacturing interests pet haps 1
i the len^Liirinrnssed and the most prosper- (
j oils of any in the Union, the renewal of a 8
policy hy indirect means, which is now,8
universally admitted to bear unequally upon
the productive industry of cliff* rent K
portions of the Union, is a inost flagrant 1
abuse of power. as well as a most wanton \8
violation of faith. The living generation '
who were the witnesses of the struggles 1
and pledges in the late contest for her con- f
stilutionnl rights, have not yet passed 1
away,?The monuments of the limes have ^
not yet perished,?the very altars conse-'1
crated by her vows, still stand before its?!'
preparations (or defence,are still in reacli- r
ness and requisition,?the age, its records,'1
and recollections, have scaicely become a| 1
part of history, before the very burdens c
and oppressions which they were intended
to resist, are renewed wtin a snumei'it iu- fidelity,
which seeks neither pretext or 1
justification. A home valuation, cash dtt- ^
ties, and an unreasonable and exorbitant F
revenue of more than thirty millions, it is 1
believed arc little less onerous in amount 1
or tinconstiiutto.ini in effect, than the enor- 1
ntous forty per cent, dtities which the }|
sovereignly of this State was so 6ternly in- 11
terposed ti? resist. And if upon the j<rin- ^
clple of uli protective duties, they ure des- "
lined to increase'to on extent and enormi- 11
ty to which our experience of the past, as ^
well as the tendency of the times, most r
emphatically for bod eg, then it will he for r
you to say, whether South Carolina has so c
fallen, from Iter high eminence of sov- n
ereignlv and independence, as it) admit by
a silent acquiescence in these wrongs and V
grievances, that there is no "mode, no "
remedy, no measure of redress." If she 1
was sufficient fhen for the emergency, she
is doubly adequate and fortified now in the l
i union and strength of all her citizens to t
meet aggressions upon her rights, come l
ijfgy. - . ' ^ * **
:om what source they miy. Nor is it i
;ss becoming the dignity anil character i
f a free Stale, in assuming a position of i
efence which she is resolved to maintain, i
;> manifest a due and timely regard for all I
ie means and appliances of rendering I
hat position, as strong and impregnable t
i fact, as it is in equity, and in argument, i
)isregar.ling all theories, that so often <
onf'Und the convictions of the best and |
uresl minds, and resorting to the resour- I
es which she can so amply command <
lirough her organized government, and i
/itil which God and the Pnnnln h.iun pn. I
owed her citizens, would hot be invinci- l
>ly united in her defence. 1
Another topic, of not lest# importance |
i itself, or of deep moment to the citizens
f this State, is the act distributing the pro- <
eeds of the public lands. As n source of I
evenue which it is proposed to abstract,
t the very instant when the Federal i
freasurv is said to require to be replen- '
shed, it would sepm like wantonly seek- 1
ng a pretext to increase taxation. But I
onsidercd in any point of view, it can be '
egarded in tin other light than that of a 1
istribution of the public revenue. In one I
ear, during a previous administration, the t
iroceeds of the sales of public lards, pro- '
need a revenue of upwards of twenty
nillions?a maximum to which, in more
irosjierons limes, it would possibly again
Haiti. Its average may even now be esimated
at five millions, which, if annually
rithdrawn from the Treasury, leaves that
leficieucy at least to be supplied by inreused
duties on imports. That the government
can exercise the power of taxaion
to raise revenue for distribution, is a
irinriple I prestimp, which this State is
tot prepared to admit Undprlhe opera- 1
ion of the various pre-emption laws, and 1
he frequent reductions in the price of >
>ublic lands, those very States which
vere the lai gest contributors t<? the "Pub-' 1
ic Domain" or whose "blood and t'eastre"
were most lavishly expended to acpiire
it, have at the same time been suhecled
to the greatest sacrifices, in the emigration
of their citizens, ami in the diminshed
value of their products, reduced by
in unequal competition with the more
thundanland teeming resources ?>f those
lew and fertile regions, which their enerprise
and indnstry have been seduced ,
tnd abstracted to cultivate, to the waste 1
ind abandonment of their own. It was
Miough to have b me all this with palmitic
devotion to the interests of our comnon
country; but when it is proposed to
livrrt that domain from the sacred purpoies
for which it w is ceded, to afford a
iretexl for additional burdens and tnxuiun
on one class of industry, to give proection
and bounty to another, it assumes
i character of the highest injustice, as
veil as the most palpable infraction of
^institutional principles.
But the most dangerous, as well as the
lmsl humiliating effect of this measure, is
he condition of dependency, to which it
educes the States, upon the bounty and
lenefaetion of the government?existing
is they would, in the relation of subsidiaries
upon the profits of their own estate?
eceiving its charity, doled nut from their
iwn \veulth, and subdued to a slate of
lornage, servility, and compliance* bv
iribes, stolen anil lavished from their own

lion ol interests, obliterating all distincimis
of sovereignty, or piide of Intlepenlence,
and tending to concentrate Empire

1 trust however, that the spirit of reform,
vhich has been so powerfully evoked by
he errors of the late session of Congress,
ind so decidedly manifested in lite results
>fthe late popular elections throughout
h'-Union, will prevent the spoils and
donder of this system, from ever soiling
he Treasury, or contaminating the cof?TS
of a single State in the Union. Let
is pause, at le.ast lor a moment, in the

noiives of an unhoughl, unierrified, and
ncorrnptihle Democracy are operating
Imir euro ntwl ctilnfnrt/ indiinttrpQ r?n tho
:ouncils and measures of Government.
Among oilier Resolution*, which, as the
ifficial communication of a sister Slate, it
s my di.tyto submit to a co-ordinate
iranch oi ihe government of this, is one
imposing to alter the Constitution, to limt
the eligibility > ( the Federal Executive
o one term of office. The experience of
his State furnishes no reasons for such I
ri innovation upon the long established i
isnge and principles of the government, i
cannot conceive that it can be productive i
f any other effects than to increase the t
isually over-wrought excitement of the |
'residential canvass?to render its recur- <
encc more frequent?to disconnect the ]
elutions of sympathy between the FiXe- ;
utive and his consiituents?to divest him i
f the most p nverfiij motives to regard ,
he will or to merit the approbation of the <
icople?and to make him the instrument .
f it party, in minister to its purposes, and :
o pander to its lust of domination. <
In all the history of our government,
he influence of the Execulsve power, to i
nodify its action on the reserved rights of <
ho Stules, has been of a conservative, I
' ' '
.r .
ather than of an aggressive character.
More thajn twice has i-. been interposed t??
escue life people from the (lomiiiatioii and
tbuscs of a National B ink. It was in defence
of our rights and our institutions,
:hat the deteruiination of a late Executive
:o refuse his constitutional sanction to. the
lbolition of slavery in any of its forms,
was so fearlessly avowed; and this State, 1
presume, can have no interest or motive
to remove the few salutary checks and
?mbarrussniftnts to the so often unjust and
inconsiderate legislation of a majority in
Congress, and to induce it to war against
the dignity and prerogatives of a department,
the weakest and most conservative,
perhaps i" the government.
I also submit for the serious consideration
of the Legislature, a copy of
the communication of the Governor of
Virginia, on the proceedings of the General
Assembly of that State, on the
subject of her late controversy with
Netv York; and Reports and Resolutions
from the Stale of Alabama, responding to
to the views and declarations so solemnly
announced by this State, on questions deep
ly involving the right of property, and the
security of the domestic'institutions of the
3 'Uili. Bound by every consideration of
luty, of interest, of honor, and of equity,
to repel so flagrant a disregard of the rights
if a sister Stale, we s ould always be
ready and prompt to redeem the pledge
if our alliance to a cause with which our
rights are so intimately identified. Relations
of amity cannot be better preserved
even between separate nations, in which
the rig ts of property are not regarded as
they exist, under trie respective laws of
each; much less can sovereign Slates be
l?ermdiier.ily allied in a bond of union, under
the. same laws, government and constitution,
where fugitives from the justice,
plunderers of the property, and violators
of the laws of one find refuge and impunity
under the sanction of the constituted allthoriiies
of the other. No wrong is more
readily resented by nations?no injustice
can more deeply stain the faith or more
essentially impair the friendlv and intimate
relations of confederated States- It
would he a reproach to the character o(
our limitations, il claims which are recognized
and reciprocated b>" the comity and
justice of all civilized nations, should be
scornfully refused and contemned by states
federated under the same laws and constitution.
If obligations of the constitution,
which require one stale to deliver, on demaud,
fugitives from the justice of another,
are to be disregarded,?our institutions
assailed, ? the plunderers of our property
encouraged and protected.?'hen must we
regard lite perpetrator of these aggressions,
'' io matter by whom c mmitte l." as a fut
to our rights and an enemy to our peace.
Whether the wrong in ibis case has b'-en
(lone to Virginia <<r South Carolina, the
principle is l ie same, the interest involved
common to both, and the responsibility
of protecting them should equally devolve
on every state in the Union, in which justice
exprriscs dominion, or similar inunions
exist. Persisting in such a course
of unpr ivoked hostility to the institution?
of the South, New York can only b -regarded
in the light of any other aggressing
power?in peace friends, but enemies in
war. The adoption in all such instances,
i- _ ... r _.l a .U?.
( I H similar cnurs" ?>i vnjuanre in iuhi
which the state of Virginia has instituted,
would perhaps bp a wise arid salutary precaution,
to prevent the recurrence of similar
aggressions upon the rights arid property
of our own citizens ami institutions
We ought, upon' every principle of equity
and of interest, to make common cause
with anv state whose rights and institutions
are thus wantonly violated and assailed.
The position which it may bpcome this
state to assume, on any of the important
questions presented, would spent to suggest
the importance and necessity of cultivating
ami improving her means of safe
ty and defence. It would he mere mockery
to vaunt of rights, liberty or sovereignty,
without the spirit, ability or resources
to defend them. It would be better at
once to endure threat ned or impending
ills, tiring"rnvated by opposition, than by
unmeaning denunciations and impotent exliioilioiis
of resistance, to provoke and increase
their bitterness. Prohibited both
by the character of our institutions, and
the restrictions of the constitution, from
resorting to oilier means of cultivating our
military resources than through that of u
well trained and organized militia, it should
he cherished to the highest slate of perfection,
and with a pride and assiduity to
maUe it the most efficient, as it is the only
means of defending the rights, the honor,
ind sovereignty of the Slate. The improvement
in which it so rapidly progress
id, under the influence of the late Brigade
Encampments,'offers the highest encourigement
to the continuance of your patronage,
as wpII as the happiest illustration
if the beneficial effects of the mode in
which it has hitherto been conferred. Aslemblcd

1 By an act of the Legislature, in Decern*
1 ber, last, the duty was devolved upon this
1 department, of proposing the acceptance
1 of ihe several Banking InstitutioiiB of this
" State, an Act to amend their Charters,
' with a view to prevent the future suspen'
sion of specie payments. The Bank of*
the Stale, I he South Western Rail Road
Bank, the Union Bank, and the Planters'
and Mechanics' Bunk, with a commenda*.
' ble desire-to conform to the wishes Rnd
objects of the State, have, in good faith*
arid sincerity, accepted its provisions.
? In executing the instruction; of the Le*
. gislattire, in that spirit of mildness and for*
ben ranee in which I am sure they were
conceived, I deemed it proper to overlook
the delay of a few weeks, after the precise
period fixed by iaw, for the acceptance of
the two latter institutions; apprised aa I
was that it had arisen from unavoidable
rircunislanres, and not from a wiriui neg*
lector refusal to comply with the requisilions
of the law. -V*
It is due to the high character which
these institutions have hitherto sustained*
and I am sure reflects no injustice upon
ihe motives of the Legislature, to state
that the ol>ject of this enactment was to
nrevfctit anticipated evils, rather tlian to
punish past </r existing abuses. The
Federal Government having, in the exercise
of a wise and sound,po|icv, abandoned
that control over thp currency which it
had hitherto usurped, the necessity of a
stricter supervision over the monetary afI'airs
of this Stale, had become more obligatory
upon those, to whom the people
have entrusted the power of regulating
them.
