The prevailing opinion among the Ofli
cers of the Army, that the Seminole In
dians are not a brave race of men, and ar
to be subdued by a small force, is entire!
erroneous. They are commanded by Powcl
a half breed, as brave a man as ever livtc
and who, in the late battle, proved himse
to be a good General, to which Gen. Clitic
and his regulars can bear testimony.
He says he can hold his present j>ositioi
against the United St:&s, 5 years; and i
ever lie is permitted to get into'the Soutlicn
J?art of the Peninsula, it is a matter o
some doubt if the whole of the U.S. Arm;
can get him out.

He told me that the distress which he
saw among the inhabitants on the frontier
I was enough to moke the heart sick ; wo

Jfontatlous dc^froyed, and every thing on

heir bodies stuck full of lightwood splinters.
"INDIAN KEY, (Florida.)
a Steam boat Champion, Jan. 13, 1830.
At this date itjwas considered that the east
part of Florida was in the possession of the
Indians, as but two plantations to the south
of St. Augustine, viz. Bub* s and Hernandez,
are left. You may depend that tlic
Indians are in greater body than supposed:
fheyliavc added to their number, about
400 negroes, taken from the different plantations
octroyed.
There are different indications that the
Creeks incline to unite with the Seminoles
in the war.

the authorities of Georgia were sending to
thepouth Western counties for their protection.

Major General Gaines reached Mobile on
the 17tk inst. on his way to Peusacola,
where he expects to obtain the assistance of
some vessels of war, %o co-operate with the
land forces, and cut off the communication
of the Indians with these foreigners. A
single Indian Chief is said to l>e in possession
of fifty casks of powder.
(xoergia Journal, January 28.
The force of the hostile Seminole Indians
is estimated at 2,500. Their leader Powell
is said to have been educated at a Choctaw
school in Kentucky.

The Banks of Charleston have agreed U
loan $2500 for this purpose. The city
corporation has appropriated 810,000, ant
the city of Augusta the same amount foi
the same purpose. Throe companies o
Volunteers have gone from Charleston t
aid in the defence of St. Augustine. J
company of 100 have gone from August
to the aid of the Territory, and a compan;
- of 02 from Savannah, and 22 from Ham
burg; Volunteers have also gone from Mo
bile, New Orleans, and other jdaces. Co
Biankhead, says the Norfolk Herald, is c
bout to proceed to Florida, to take charg
of the Artillery in that quarter. Gcr
Gaines, Gen. Scott, and Gen. Kastis, hav
also gone on. A requisition has been mad
by the War department for malitia upon tli
Governors of this State, Georgia, and Alt
baina. And the Charleston Mercury say;
that an express left Charleston from Ger
Eastis, who was in the city, to Gov. M<
i Duffie, calling upon him for a draught of 60
men for three months. Tho Governor <
Georgia, we learn from the Georgia Jouri
al, has ordered a draught of 3^500 men. f<
immediate service. A numberof Cbmpi
ntes have responded to the call, ofFerir
their services without a draught.
A Washington correspondent of tl
Charleston Courier Says;
44 (icn. Jackson has issued an order 1
tho troops in Georgia, directing them 1
proceed to Florida, and acting i?i concc
with the militia, not to give the Seminoles
i, any terras of -peace, till every Indian is cut|
barked on board of vessels, for the West of

j . *ng me rrcsiacnvs ? special
J overture was made by the French Government
j for the adjustment of our'difficulties with that
i Government and that it was rejected by the
j President. Tlio reason assigned is that the
overture was made only by Mr. Pagcot's reading,
and afterwards sending, to the Secretary of
Stato a communication addressed to Mr. Pagcot
himself. Mr. Forsyth and the President allege
that the communication could not be used with
propriety in any way because it would not be answered.
Mr. Forsyth could not answer it by addressing
Mr. Pageot, for it was not from him, nor
could he address the French Minister, Mr. Forsyth
however, it will be seen, offered to lay the
substance of the paper beforo the Presrdent, if Mr.
Pageot would communicate it in a letter to himself.
There is at least plausibility in the course of
toe President in this particular. Tlio paper has
been published, and is of a conciliatory tone, but
takes ground to which the American Government
could not accede, We shall endeavor to find room
for it, or for at least the material parts of it in our
. We have no room for remarks on the
French question.

t. A bill has been introduced into the Lec
gislature of Pennsylvania, to renew the
u Charter of the United. States Bank, with a
e capital of 28 millions of dollars, being the
lc present capital, after deducting the amount
)C of Stock owned by the U. States. The
u Bank to pay a bonus of 82,000,000, to
3) works of Internal Improvement in the State
1# of Pennsylvania. The charter also contains
the following provisions :
0 " The Bank to pay for privileges granted,
rf two millions of Dollars, at such time and
i- in such instalments, as the Governor may
:>r require, on 30 days notice, and all such
tu sums not paid within 3 months after aeeepig
j tance of charter, the Bank to pay 5 per cent.
i interest. The Bank to loan the commonic
I wealth when required, six millions of dollars,
reimbursable in 183G, at 5 per cent,
to When loan is but 3 per cent, Bank to pay
to $110 in money, lbr 8100 in stock ; when 1
rt'per cent, 8100, and to advance the com
luonweulth as a temporary loan in any one
year, one million of Dollars, at 4 per cent."
Thus_tljc existence of this knoblo institu*
tion, will probably be continued,, but without
its former facilities ?f serving the country.
Without expressing any opinion on
the constitutional question involved in^tlic
grant of its charter, we may be |>crmitted
to say, that no institution ot\th# same kind,
has ever done the same amount of good lor '
any country in the same length of time that
this Dank has done for the United States.
And no inonied institution has ever been
j managed with more honesty, or greater re!
gard to the public welfare. It would, however,
be a most dangerous instrument in the
hands, or under the influence of a corrupt
administration of the Federal Government.
A memorial has been presented to the
Legislature of Pennsylvania to inquire into
the tendency of Free Masonry, and secret
societies. The subject has been referred
in the House of Representatives to a committee
with power to send for persons and
papers.
The cqmniittee accordingly summoned
before it Gov. Wolf, Gen. Marks, formerly
I nited States Senator, Geo. M. Dallas, and
other distinguished men of that State. Gov.
W. refused to appear before ihe committee,
and being brought before tliem by attachment,
refused to be sworn or to testify*;
as did also the others who appeared upon
being subpeened. They maintain that if they
violated any law of the land they are ready
to abide the penalty. But the punishment
must be inflicted by the judgment of their 1
peers and the laws of the land. They 1
maintain that the constitution gives no jurisdicton
to the Legislature in the case.
" Since the above was written we learn
that the chairman of the committee introduced
a resoluiton into the House, that the .
witnesses be "committed to the Sergeant at
Arms until delivered by due course of law." j
For whibh a substitute was offered by ano- .
ther member, providing that the "House ,
forbear to punish the contempt &c. and that
the said witnesses be discliargcd forthwith " 1
Thr> substitute was. after a long debate,
adopted by a majority of three votes, and j
the witnesses discharged.
Two Rail Roads arc be commenced in
the Territory of Michigan in the spring. i
The Senate of Alabama refused to concur ]
with the House of Representatives in pass- '
ing a resolution to rescind that of last year ,
nominating Judge White for the Presidency.
The same body rejected a resolution j
introduced to instruct the United States j
Senators from that State to vote for Coloilel j
Benton's famous "expunging resolution." \
The convention of 1832 between the U.
States and France contains the following j
article.
. Article 7.?The present temporary Con- ,
vention shall be in force tor two years front
the first day of October next, and even after I
the expiration of that term, until the conclusion
of a definitive treaty, or until one of j
the parties shall have declared its intention
lu *>-"^incc it; tchich declaration shall be
made at least six nunuru, boforc hand."
" An eminent civilion of this city is of 1
opinion, (says the N. York Mercantile Ad.
vertiser <$ Akvocate) that this article is not
affected by any subsequent convention or
treaty, and is still in force."
A letter from an American in Paris, to a
correspondent in N. York says,
*' There has lately been published here,
Charts of our whole Sea Coast, arid especially
accurate Maps of the entrance of every
harbor on the Gulf of Mexico. The Chart
of Pensacola gives the channel, position of
the Forts and Navy Yard, and is beautifully
executed. In the event of a war betwoen
France and the United States, the stirtion
of the French fleet will be the West
Indies, and their first astempt will be to take
Pensacola, and command the commerce of
the Mississippi. v

The Practical Culturist in this country noeds
a directory adapted to the soil on which ho plants
his trees, and tho climate in which ho roars his

j less congenial to their growth. It has boon therefore
