FRIDAY EVENING, SEPT. 20, 1839.
Somo stale arlicK-s of uen s appeared in our
co amui last week, given out the week before,
wliichthe Editor did not observe till the paper
was worked off.
Tire Pee Dee has 6eldom been u6 ?'o;v as it
is at present.
T he Hon. John P. Richardson has resigned
hi9seat in Congress?on account of ill health.
We have heard of no one yet in nomination
to fill the vacancy.
The Maine election has terminated in favor
of the administration, and the Vermont election
against it by a small majority.
Whig Banner.?Tins is the title of a now
paper issued at Lincolnton, N. C., by H. W.
Guion, Esq. It is successor to the Lincoln
Transcript recently published at that place.
To Stock Breeders. Messrs. J. S. Skinner
&. Son, of Baltimore, Md. advertise for salo "A

They also offer "an improved Irish Cow,
which has given 32 quarts of milk a day;" aud a
young Jack, by Black Hawk, the largest jack in
the United States. Prices not stated.
The Licence Laws.?Great efforts are now
making in Georgia to abolish tho practice of
legalising tbo sate of ardent spirits by selling
licenses for that purpose. Many are disposed to
make the question a test at tho approaching eiection.
This is most zealously opposed by partizan
editors, and parlizan leaders, who scetn to
care very little for the moral condition or social
happiness of the country provided Only their
party can have the ascendency.
In different parts of this state, also, meetings
have been held and moasures have been ado; ted
to circulate and send up to the Legislature, at
its approaching session, petitions to abolish the
license laws. The array of moral strength, and
we hope of political strength too, in support of
these petitions will be very respect .blc. Wheth.
cr they can succeed at the first attempt or not,
the time is not far off whan ihey will certainly
cuccoed if they only persevere. The practice
of granting men licence by 'he state to do that,
tho only tendency of which is to destroy the
morals, tho health and the lives of thousands
Upon thousands of its citizens, is too monstrous '
to bear investigation. It would certainly be
much less injurious to the state to license houses
for the reception and sale of stolen goods.
Independence.?The following is going the
i-ounds of the newspapers as an extract from an 1
address, by Gen. A. G. Brown whilo a candidate
for Congress in the State of Mississippi.
In tho company in which I muster, the demo. |
cratic company, when the captain orders halt i
we all stop, and if Mr. Van Burm were to. ]
*ni*rrn*n tn ami that he would no lonircr advise the I
Sub Treasury scheme, I should at once dro* it j
and sat no more about it." |
There are many raon of higher pretensions :
than Gen. Brown who, perhaps without disern.
?nent to perceivo it, or if they do pcrceivo it,
are without candour to own it, arc equally dependent
upon others for their political opinions.
Dr. Marks, near"!Columbia, advertises that he
expects next spring to commence tho manufacture
of silk thread, and that he will at that time i
be prepared to purchaso cocoons. '
The fever in Augusta continues without
abatement. A letter writer states that the i
population is believed to have been reduced I
by flight to about 1000.
In Charleston the yellow fever still contin- i
ues but does not seem to increase in violence.
In Mobile and New Orleans i: prevails extensively
and with great fatality.
Accounts from Texas state that four of the
most Northern States of Mexico which had revolted
from the central government propose to
theTexian< a mutual recognition of indepen- (,
dence, and a treaty of alliance against MexicoPublic
opinion in Texas seems to be divided 1
on the subject. Some are for the project, and
others for a union. Others still seem to doubt
whether the Mexican states are qualified for
free government.
The Great Western and British Queen. It
is remarkable how even men, commonly reputed
to possess a modicum of common sense
will become infatuated under the excitement
of a race. We find in the newspapers, cards
from committees of the passengers on board
the above named steamers during their recent
trial of speed across the Atlantic, from which
we take the following sentences.
,,n?Ti?i il>a thonL-o nf tlio nasspn.
"AemVCUj 1 liat IUb IIIUIIUU v. vi.v r ?
gers on board the Great Western be returned
to Capt. Hosken for his kind attentions to us
during our recent voyage from New York?a
a voyage which we believe will prove to have
comprehended the shortest passage ever made
across the Atlantic, and which we know to
have been one of the most agreeable and satisfactory."
&c. &c.
'Sir.?We cannot take leave of the British
Queen without returning you and your officers
our thanks for your polite attention to us during
our rapid and pleasant voyage across the
Atlantic, and expressing our approbation of the
excellent accommodation provided for us, and
of the admirable qualities of the vessel under
your command.'* die. &c.
The card from which the latter of these senfences
is taken is signed C. 0. Cambrelino,
and that from whicti the former is taken is
headed withtne name of J. Hamilton; Now
this same J. Hamilton was prevented from be
ing on board a steamboat which was lost within
the memory of most of us whilst striving to
make "the shortest past age ever made' ^ between
Charleston and New York, only by the
providential "accident*' of his being unable to
get ready. The citizens of Charleston, in
public meeting, if we recollect right, soon afterward*'
expressed their disapprobation of the I
i,? fc.| || y | wimmmaBKMBamaamaaBBmmmm
practice of stimulating steamboat captains to
run against time* or against each others by
commendatory cards for quick passages.-?
Whether "J. Hamilton*' was present at that
meet = g or not, we do not now recollect.

A public meeting was held at Sumterville on

RECENT DISCOVERY OF LIME IN STOKES CO., N. C.
We take the following paragraph from a
letter to the editor of the Farmers' Register,
dated Guilford, N. C. Dec. 28/A 1838.
Lime hns heretorore been beyond our reach
hovnnr] nnr hnr?P9. But ffOfU thP aCCidCn* I

'al burning of the soil of a neighboring county
(Stokes) in the course of the last year, we now
entertain the belief that it may ultimately be
furni hed in such quantities and for such prices
as will justify its application as a manure for
lands. The soil was underlaid with a species
of roclc that no person had ever dreamt of be- j
ing lime-stone; but the first rain that fell after
the fire, the rock slacked and furnished a quantity
of fine lime. The quarries from which the
rock were obtained are about thirty miles west
of this place, and are said to be inexhaustible.
if North Carolina had appointed a competent
Geologist 20 yea re ago to survey the
state, at an expense of only a very few thou-^
sand dollars, her wealth might by this time
have been increased many millions from the
proper application of her beds of lime stone.
If the education of our farmers* sons were
such as it ought to be, and such as it might be
at but little expense, no bed of lime-stone lying
about the surface of the earth would remain
so many years in long settled neighborhoods
without its nature being discovered.
AS INFIDEL RECANTING.
A Mr. Russell Canfield, of Rochester, N. Y.
who had for some time been a public lecturer in
support of the monstrous absurdities of Infidelity
and Atheism, has recently addressed a letter
to the Rev. Geo. M West, of Philadelphia, from
which the following extract has been published?
" During and since November last, my mind
has often been deeply, solemnly and singularly
affected. My last lecture was given in the fall,
and I have declined any offer to lecture since
that time, nor have I attended the lecturing of
another on anti*reiigious topics, though he is
located in this city. I have also declined a continuance
of my review of Dr. Sleigh's Dictionary.
The why I imputo to the impression already
mcntionod. I have attended mcetfngs for wor
si lip much more frequent than formerly, and I
trust to more edification. One preacher, Mr.
Goodwin, of the Methodist order, I esteem high,
ly, for his candor, his ability, his kindness. Under
his affectionate appeals my sympathies have been
affected, and the falling tears have witnessed the
softening influence of his manner. Within the
three or four past weeks, I seem to havo travailed
with tho "burden" of Philadelphia You under,
stand ino here. Four yearn ago, or nearly, 1
promised first in public, at Temperance Hall, to
renounce error when discovered, as putetcty ?s
[ then advocated what I believed to be truth ;
ind there I think myself called to speak of the
jrreat chango in my views which has lately occured.
I am entirely passive, awaiting the
motion of an influence, and merely asking,
"Lord, what wouldst thou have me to do ?w
There has been an arrival of specie from
Vera Cruz to-day, to the amount of 8125,000,
and also ?48,00 from New-Orleans, making
?173,000 in all. These movements of specie
from one port of the United States to another,
are indicative of great management on the
part of the banks, which seem to be speculating
altogether, and tho disordered state of the
exchanges is both a cause and a consequence.
Char Cour.
IIow any one can reosonably expect a concert
among the numerous banks of the United*
State?, to regulate the currency of the country
and that too, against the interest of very many
of these bank?, seems to us to be beyond the
comprehensive of any rational man.
THE FEVER, A G >OD PROSPECT.
There are now but a few cases of stranger's
fever in our city?and we have good reason
to assume that in the course of a fortnight
there will be none. This opinion is founded
on the fact of the prevalence among us of another
less fatal epidemic which seems to be
supplanting the other. It is a fever, Vulgarly
called the Broken Bone Fever, somewhat re.
sembling the Dar.gue?It lasts generally from
two to three days?and is easily managed?
rarely if ever terminating fatally. We may
therefore congratulate ourselves, that between
the two evils we have a chance of the less, as
as it is a principle, we learn, in medicine, that
no two diseases affecting the whole system can
exist in a patient at one and the same time, nor
can two epidemics prevail simultaneously in
the same atmosphere?as the causes of the one
expel the causes of the other.

IMPORTANT FROM WASHINGTON?THE CAP.
TURED AFRICANS.
Wc learned yesterday from Washington,
(saystheN. Y. Herald, of 10th inst.l that Se.
cretary Forsyth has had an inverview with the
Spanish minister, relative to the Africans captured
in the Amistead, and that a correspondence
or interview has taken place of some kind
in which the Secretary has indicated a willingness
to give up these men to the requisition of
the Spanish government.?This intention of
the Secretary, however, requires the sanction
of the President, who, at the last accounts,
was at Rochester, and whose opinions on the
subject arc not yet known. It seems that Secretary
Forsyth bases his intention on some
clause of a treaty with Spain. If this be so, the
government have the absolute disposition of
these men, and the proceedings at New-London
or New-Haven, ;f the government chooses
to act, are null and void.
The British government has concluded a
contract with private individuals for an extensive
steam communication between England
and the West Indies and the ports of South
America; and, the packets are also to call at
Charleston, S. C.' if not at another of our
Southern ports. The st<am ships are to be
fourteen in number, and ofl400 tons burthen
?and there are to be two mails per month to
and fro.
DISTRESSING EFFECTS OF THE LATE GALE.
The Norfolk Beacon of the 10th inst. says:
?" We learn troin a gentleman who arrived
here from North Carolina on Monday evening,
that the gale was very destructive in Ty
rreJ County, (N. C.) The tide rose to such
| a height that the inhabitants were compelled
I to seek safety in their garrets and on the trees,
i Nearly all the cattle in the low lands of the
country were destroyed."
From a Correspondent of the National Intelligencer.
New York, September 10.
The Groat Western arrived this morning*
bringing us news from London to the evening
of Aug. 23d, being twenty-four days later.?
I She brings 110 passengers, among whom are
I Gov. Reynolds, of Illinois, and Gt n. Rawlings,
i from, it is said, not unsuccessful European
I money expeditions. The Great Western beat
I the British Queen out, in time and distance,
I 12 hours, but about 24 from port to port.?
| 'l his trip has been a very boisterous one.
What is the state of the crops ? was the
first question in Wall street. It is difficult to
answer this now, but the best opinion I can
get from reading a great variety of English
newspapers, is that there will be art average
crop, and that the crop is nearly out of peril.
Of this, however, there is some doubt, and the
fact is not admitted to be settled, and will not
be settled probably ,ev*en by the British Queqg.
In France most of the grain had been harvested
and the crops were remarkably good. *
The Bank of England raised the rate of i%
terest on the 8th to 6 per cent.., and the rate
was fully sustained. The imports of bullion
were much greater than the exports, although
the Bank of England continued to be drained.
That institution had borrowed two millions of
the Bank of France, and could have more if it
wished. The agency of the Bank of the Uni

Mr. Jaudon was on the Continent, and it was
seated he had negotiated a large loan on
American securities for the Bank. American
stocks in London had sold at still lower rates,
and were unsaleable; several agents that
went out in the Great Western to negotiate
loans returned without effectirg any object;
but it is stated in the Commercial this evening
that Gen. Rawlings and Col. Oakley had sueceeded
in negotiating a loan of 4,000,000 Illi.*
nois bonds on favorable terms.
England continued in great agitation on account
of the Chartists, and theii movements
were alarming, but were not feared. Most of
the leaders have been tr ed and found guilty,
end sentenced to imprisonment for one and
two years. Those rone *rned in the Birmingham
riot we<-e sentenced to death, but are to
be transported.
Setember 11.
The general impression now is, that the
news is good, or rather promises to be good.?
Money, it is true, was scarce in England, and
bore a high rate of interest; but the panic
was over; the exchanges were turning, or
turned, in favor of England, nullion was running
there from all quarters of the wort i; and
the crops, or prospects for the crops, were not
bad, if not good. Things w ere clearly settling
down there into a quiet state. The Chartists
were going to work again. The Bank of England
was discounting commercial paper,
though at six per cent. The conditions of the
Illinois sales, however, are reported to he
such as cannot be accepted, and such as will
fall through. The Commissioners are here.
The flour market must be depressed, I think,
by the news respecting the European crops,
though I have seen no sales to-day. What
keeps flour up here is a short supply, the farmers
in the interior, who have been accustomed
to high prices, positively refusing to sell upon
lh ? offers the millers now make, in the belief
that as the season advances the price of flour
wit! riser Ill-judged as this opinion is, upon
existing facts aud prospects, the custom of receiving
high prices for wheat makes the farm"
ers now the holders on, and thus we have a
short supply, keeping up prices, whereas if the
wheat went forward as usual the fall would be
very great.
From the U. S. Gazette.
'After we had written the article on the
news, we had an opportunity of ascertaining
the contents of several letters written in London
at the latest possible hour for the Great.
Western. A sale of 8.000 bales of cotton had
been made that day, at an advance, and the
market was good. The harvest was considered
as a fair crop; and one merchant who sent out
his order by the Liverpool for the purchase of
flour, countermanded the order, andjadded that,
any had been purchased, it should be sold, if
necessary, at fifty cents less per barrel. This
is a pretty strong proof that the complexion of
affairs on the 23d of August was much better
than on the 1st of that month, and there can
be no doubt but it is improving.
One remark may be made on the grain
news "from the Continent. There the harvest
is good, excepting at the North, and should it
- ? * * _ it r :
fail there and England need a sraaji foreign
supply, the demand must be on the United
States, which could be made without gold
from England, while it would be equal to gold
from our ci nntry.
"The news is every way as good as any one
could expect, for the particular season."
The five great powers, England* France,
Russia, Prussia, and Austra. have undertaken
to put an end to trie war between Turkey and
Egypt, and have dictated terms to the latter.
Mehemet Ali was to give back the Turkish
fleet to the Sultan.
The Thames Tunnel was carried to within
five feet of low water mark on the Middlesex
shore, and it wa6 expected to be quite clear in
a week, when the undertaking ought be said
to be completed.
The following paragraph i6 from the London
Times of tbe loth :
"In a letter from our Paris correspondent,
published in the Times of 1st instant, it was
stated that a negotiation was in progress between
the French Government and General
Henderson for a treaty of amity and commerce
with the republic of Texas; and that M-.
Huges, the Charge d'Affaires from the United
States at Stockholm, had acted as mediator.
We now learn,from authority, that a negotiation
for such a treaty has been opened in
Paris, but not. as our correspondent had been
informed through the medium of Mr Hughes,
but of Mr. Pontois, the French Minister of the
United {States, now in Paris, and of General
Cass, the American Minister to the French
Government."
A Practical Farmer and brebder.-The
American Farmer (Md.)says:
"Gov. Sprigg's collection of fine cattle, on
his farm in Prince George's is said to be
superior to any other in the State. The base
of his present stocK is Holderness, Tees water,
and Bak? well, crossed upon for several years
by ihe best Durham bul!s. He has about fifty
cows and neifers.' says a correspondent of
the Farmer, the most perfect looking animals
I ever saw, and he has also fine Saxon and
South Down sheep/ The South Down sheep
are in high repute."
Dr. D. Cooper, of Harris County, in this
State, has exhibited to us a stalk of Cotton,
of superior staple, which he assured us sometimes
grows to the height of nine feet, thickly
studed with bolls, from the ground to the top,
presenting the appearance of a beautiful white
cockade. The Dr. computes that upwards of
3000 lbs. to the acre may be raised, and that
it is worth from three to rive per cerit more
than the common Petit Gult Cotton, We are
informed that large sales of the seed have been
made at fit y cents each. In some instances
the seed have been Bold at $160 the bushel.

Dr. ( '. is thoroughly convinced of the superiority
of thisjCotton, and is taking great pains

region. Columbus Sentinel.
Mobile, Sept. 5.?The malignant Fever which
has been existing in the city, is evidently on the
spread. The physicians have ceased reporting,
. ' from general inquires among thetn, we are
justified in saying that the disease is thoroughly
seated among us, aud that it is the duty of every
one to act with that understanding.
Ot the extent of the mortality we are unable to
speak with accuracy. For the three days, ending
on Monday evening, the interments were
twenty-nine. They have increased during the
last two days. Among the signs, from which
our readers may form an e-timate for themselves,
wo notice among the proceedings of the Board of
Alderman of Tuesday, an appropriation of $i!91
to pay the burial fees at the Hospital, and outdoor
charity funerals, during the past month.
Tiie items were forty-two individuals buried at
the cost of the city.
It is useless to enlarge Upon this state of things,
as it would be folly, if not worse, to disguise it.
It is our duty to give this full warning.
We had the pleasure, a few days a go, by
stepping into the store of Messrs. W. & A.
Stith, of seeiog several bushels of CoCoons,

TIIE ALABAMA CoTTON CROP.
We have taken the utmost pains to inform
ourself, both from testimony and observation.
We give it, then, as our decided opinion, that
the production of the present year? will fall
greatly short of the expectation which the early
appearance of the crop justified. The uncommon
dryness of the season has whitened the
ground with the bloom, and the depredations
of the worm are unusually eevero. We have
seen whole fields upon the tidge, in which
scarcely a young boll can be found upon the
stalk. In the cane-break, where a Very fair
crop was made last yean some think that the
present will be less by at least one third, and
few that it will equa; that production. On the
sandy lands, they did not, last season raise
more than half a crop, if so much, we hope tbey
will do better now. but the prospect is exceedingly
gloomy for any thing like an average
crop.
The Marion Herald of3!st August speaking
of the promising appearance of the Cotton
Crops in the cane-break, continues. Crops on
the sandy lands, however have been seriously
injured. Their consistency is not well calculated
to sustain a drought, after a long continuation
of fine season. The young bolls and
squares have been almost entirely castoffi and
a great portion of the bolls nearly matured
have been ruined by the ravages of the worm.
We regret to learn from planters both in
this and in neighboring counties that the
worm is perpetrating considerable damage
ttpod the growing cctton crops.
Selma Free Press.
The North Alabamian of24th August, says:
"Our conntry is at this time suff ring severely
with drought. Cotton is greatly injured,
in so much that many farmers have expressed
their opinion that their prospects are not so
good by 60 per cent as they were four weeks
ago a large portion of the bolls having fallen
off. and the balance not well grown."
RATIONAL MILITARY CONVENTION.
The General Convention of the friends of a
well-regulated and efficient Militia will be
told in the mty of New York on the first Monday
of October next. Its object will be
to consider the state of the present system, and
take such measures as may be thought proper
to bring the subject under the attention of
Congress, in order that suitable alterations may
be effected in the universally acknowledged
defective Militia laws. The late New York
StateJ Military Convention recommended the
appointment ofdelegates throughout the Uuion,
in the following number and manner: That
