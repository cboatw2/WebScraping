artificially the price of all products, so tha(
though all were dear, yet the same quan
tity of each commanded in exchange as
tmuch as any ~other, as if .all were alike
cheap (for equal protection practically ap
plied.could only mean this;)-were this
for anyfanciful purpose ever so dezirable,
it must be obvious that in this country it is
no louger possible. By what process could
we raise the price of our cottons, our
woollens, Our hardware, and the numner
003 articles of mnnufaci tures which consti
tute our exports ? They must be sold it
-ireign markets at the same prices as the
goods coming into our competntiiou with
them from all other sources.
The same articles will command only
the same prices for home use, that they do
for exportation, and this price must there
fore be the lowest natural price determined
by the open competition of the world.
La*s made to protect such articles must
alvays be a mere dead letter. To prohib
it the importation of an article which we
produce in excess, which excess is disposed
of in open cottipetition with the whole
world, can never by any possibility raise
the price of that article at home. It is
beyond the power of the law to protect
such interests. But on the other hand the
law is all powerful to protect aud to raise
the price of those commodities which we
produce in deficiency,-of which we are
obliged to import some portion to make up
the quantity required. Whatever duty is
placed on the article imported must ena
ble'the producer at home to command a
price as much higher than the producers
of that article abroad as the duty amounts
to. Protection, therefore, though avow
edly extended to all alike, would land us
in this dilemma-those classes who pro
- duce such articles as we export in change
for the luxuries, or the necessaries, or t he
raw materials. which we receive from for
eign countries, would obtain from the rest
of the community at home only the same
price that they received abroad in the
open markets, while they would have in
pay to the producers of articles of which
we are deficient, an enhanced price equal to
the-duty imposed on the quantity imported.
Thusthe various producers ofhardware,
cottous, and woolens in Sheffield, Man
chester, and Leeds, receive from the far
mers and landlords only the-same prices
that they do fron their cust-omdrs i. the
United States or Germtiny ; but they have
to pay to the farmers and landlords a price
for their produce as much higher as the
effective duty which is placed on the pro
duce of the fartmer of foreign courtries.
It must be quite clear, therefore, that if
equality be honestly intended. to all the
va.ied interests of the community, it can
cannot be accomdlished by protettion; it
cannot be accomplished by anty attempt to
elevate prices generally to an artificial
standard ; but it can be jdone, and can only
he done, by allowing all alike to remain at
the natural rate determined, by that free
competition to which a large porion must
be exposea, and therefore to which all
should be equally exposed. Tha tjust
equality of interest which the principle of
Protection cannot accomplish, Free 'Trade
alone can accomplish.

"Oun Cuanoxs D'AFFAIRVs.
Our Charges d'Affaires and CounstIjs
are too frequontly selected for the enjoy
ment of the place, rather than for any
particular talent to represent our country
abroad. As far as talent goes, some of
them possess it, in an eminent degree, but
few, however, ex.-rcise their functions with
reference to the great interests at home.
Rencher. at Lishon. enjoys.jhe climate,
and in the style of a Southern planter, di
vides in easy stages the necessities of the
day's existence. The Tagus i-s a benuti
ful river, at the mouth of which is the city
of Lisbon, once truly the capitol of an in
dependeut government, but now in fact but
a British out-post, whose commerce is en
tirely controlled by British policy. Mr. R.
has endeavored to have the boun'es and
other advantages in favor of England, so
accommodated as to permit American bot
toms to enjoy similar privileges, in order
that the wines, stilt and wool. may become
an object in our direct trade. As yet no
intelligence has been received from him,
to warrant the hope of any mediation in
that respect. The climate of Portugal is
milder and more regular than N. Carolina,
ivhilst the industry and- resources of the
countrias are very similar. The former
representative of the Chatham district
finds every thing there to remind him of
home, except the fruits of the LTsurline Sis
ters, and the entire absence of the home
currency, pitch and tar.
Mr. Clemson, at Brussels, possesses ev
ery advantage in promoting his scienti6c
investigations, Ire being one of the first
Chemists of the day. There is more in
dustry and comfort in Belgium, than in
any of the smaller Sbvereignties, nd
Brussels is one of the most beautiful cities
of Europe. Carpets and laces abound, and
manufactures are constantly in construc
tion. At Ostend are many beautiful pie
tures, for which he possesses very great
taste. There is no doubt Mr. Clenson
will he of advantage to his native land :n
the developementt of some df the new prin
ciples and elements which the rapid matich
of science daily disclopes.
With Christopher Hughes. Esq., corn
monly called "Kitt Bu-hes,"-who that
has crossed the water, has not an acquain
tance? The lague is a bLeautiful city, the
seat of wealth. for which in- former days
Holland was so famous. If ihe climate
is so wet and dry, as to prevent the raising
of grain or fruit, there is nevertheless pa:
tience, econemy and neatness that entirelf
compensates for the marshness of the soil.
In the diplomatic circles, Mr. Hughes has
acquired some eclat,from the facility with
which he discourses S!ate secrets. His
residence is most admirabiy futr'ished, in
the kingdotn, not with an ostentatious dis
play, but in the neatness and style of a
plaiti republican gentlemau..w ho fornearly
thirty years has held the confitlence of his
own -govertnient. The conueisseur and
virtuoso. may delight themselver for a
month in !he contemplation of his -esearch
es in the antigue, and the choice specimens
of plate and other objects of .admirable
workmanship thal adorn his drawing
room. It is to be regretted that of late
though not wealthy, he has launched into
the extravagancies of "the npper ten thou
sand," and therefore there is something to
near, tr tbe eveuror petuimry-turras
tmenss, that may be consequent to his in
discretion in this particular.
At Copenhagen there resides as true a
Dane as any in Denmark, in the person of
WVm. W. Irwin. -ith a heart ready to

him, lie endures the severities of a niorih

perfect composure and stoical resignation.
Denmark commands the entrance to the
Baltic, and levies a toll upou all ships that
