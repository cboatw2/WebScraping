' New Mode of Raising the Wind.?The
other morning, a lady left home to make
some purchases, pay.some visits, or trans*
act some other femenine business no mat- |
Icr what. As sho was walking along one I
of our best streets, which happened to be
nearly empty at the time, she was suddenly
accosted by a getleman, a perfect stranger
to her. He was short and stout, with
a bushy head of hair, while gloves, and
all the other outward evidence of gentility.
We addressed her very familiarly, and expressed
his pleasure at having met her.
"I believe I have not the honor of your
acquaintance, sir," said the lady; d|ily, for
his familiarity was rather of the impertinent
order.
"Well, never mind about that, it is never
too late to form an agreeable acquaintance.
Ate you going up this way ? I'll go along;
or, here, take my arm."
"I really must decline the honor, sir, and
request you, if you are a gentleman, to
leave me at once.
"Bah ! how pretty you look when you
are angry!" and the vulgar fellow was preparing
to put his arm round her waist,
when the ladv was over-joyed at seeing a
tail well, dressed, gentlemanly roan turn
the corner, and advance rapidly towards
them. Her exclamations brought him to
her side at once, and his presence seemed
to cool down, in a wonderfull degree the
ardor of the first comer.
" What is the matter madam?" he asked,
" has anything happened? Can I be of service
to you in any way ?"
" Sir, I have been grossly insulted by
this person."
" You scoundrel!" (shaking his stick
at the short fellow, who sneaked away)
"if it was not for making a scene in the
open-street, I would cudgel you to death.
(To the lady.) The-vagubund who presumed
to insult you is gone, madam; you
need not fear now
? ? - j?i
" I am unaer tne greuic&v uunjalions
"
44 Oh, don't mention it, I beg you. Will
you allow me to escort you, to prevent the
repetition of any such insult?"
441 should b8 sorry to trouble you, but
really I have been so much agitated by
what has happened, and my nerves are
quite unstrung, and I must go home?if it
is not taxing your politeness too much?
that fellow may return." %
44 Don't be afraid, I will lake care of
him."
The lady accepted the gentleman's proffered
arm very thankfully, anil retraced he
steps home. On the way they talked
about balls and concerts, the weather, the
opera, the news of the day, and other
nothings which make up fashionable conversation.
To judge from 'the genllemnn'a
mnnncrs and discourse, as well as
fiom his frock, cane and yellow gloves, he
was altogether comme il faut.?When
they reached the lady's door, he bowed
aud was taking his leave.
" I really feel much indebted, sir," said
he," for your very timely interference."
41 Don't say any thing more, I beg of
you."
44 Very much indebted, indeed, and if?if
I could acknowledge your services in any
way?"
44 Why, if you please, you may give
two shillings."
44 Two !" The lady was thunderstruck;
but she realy felt grateful to her
preserver from insult, and without saying
a word, pulled out her purse and hunded
him the money. He took it and walked
"away. At the corner our short frie:id of
the cloak and while gloves met him.
44 Well," asked he, 44 how much did you
g'tl"
44 Two shillings," replied he of the cane
" and yellow gloves.
44 That will do; let's go and get some
' breakfast."?iV. Y. Mirror.

The "World's End.?During the last
nr iliroA rpntnries. uDwards of thir
- teen fixed stars have disappeared. One of
them situated in the Northern Hemisphere,
presented a peculiar brilliancy, and was so
bright as to be seen by the naked eye at
mid-day. It seemed to be on fire, appearing
first of a dazzling white then of a reddish
yellow, and lastly, an ashy pale color.
La Place supposes that it was burned up as
it has never been seen since. The confla.
gration was visible about sixteen mouths.
. How dread Ail! A whole system on fire,
the great ceutural luminary and its planets,
with their plains, mountains, forests, villages,
cities and inhabitants, all iu flames,
consumed and gone fovever. Here we
have a presumptive proof of the truth, and
a{so!emn illustration of a singular passage
in a very old book?"The heavens shall
pass away with a great noise, the elements
shall melt with fervent heat, the world also,
and the works that arc therein, shall be
burned up."
federal desperation.
Mr. Pickens truly compared the cjamor
of Federalism, at llie passage-of llie Independent
Treasury bill, to the bowling of
wolves, which were at length driren away
from the prey upon which they had so
long been feasting. Let the people not be
deceived. The wolres will not abate their
howling, unless they can once more fasten
their dry, unbloody langs in the vitals of
the country. The speculating classes, of
which Whigcry is chiefly composed, look
upon the national exchequer, which is
drawn froni the sweat of the people, as a
prey, a carcass, upon which it is their
privilege to feed. Let those who toil and
create, see that their substance is not eaten
up by those who *' toil not, neither do
they sj in."

A TRAGIC STORY. ... i
fnl _ ?. * l-i ninmi- 1
me si. JL.0U1S uuuenn reiaies a amgu- |
lar. story on the authority of a trader from
Lake Superior. After alluding to the
North Passage by two young men of the
Hudson's Bay Company, it states Jhat
they both set out homewards, eager to
communicate the intelligence:
On the arrival of the two at Lake Winnepick,
they disagreed about the route
which should be pursued, and there separated.
Mr. Simpson, accompanied by
Mr. Bird, Mr. Legros, and twenty or
thirty of the colonists, struck across for
Saint Peters, intending to push on to New
York, via of the lakes, and from thence ]
sail for Liverpool. Mr. Dace, his compeer,
with another party, set out for the
Canadas. I
About the 20th of June, Mr. Simpson,
and his party had reached Turtle river,
where they encamped for the night. He
had, from the beginning of the iourncy,
I exhibited occasional symptom of mental
hallucination, caused, as the party supposed,
by the dread of being outstripped
by his competitor in their long race for
London. On the evening above men .nnnrl

a late hour at night, and even then his feverish
state of excitement deprived him
of nourishment or rest.
When they stopped, and while in the
act of camping, Mr. Simpson turned suddenly
round, and shot Mr. Bird through
the heart; and before the astounded party
could fly from the presence of the madman,
he discharged the other barrel, and
mortally wounded Mr. Legros. It appears
the party had separated, and when
he committed the murder on his companions,
there wereJ only two more present,
one of them a son of Legros, who immediately
fled a short distance. The dying
father earnestly implored Simpson to permit
his son to return and embrace him before
he should die, which he agreed to
do, and beckoned them back, saying
there was nothing to fear.

gros of conspiring with Bird, and asked
him whether it was not their intention to
assassinate him that night? The dying man
said it was, but upon being interrogated
a second time, he denied having any intention
or design of such a deed, and
shortly after he expired. Simpson then
ordered the two men to bridle their horses, j
and prepare to return with him to the set- J
tlement, but no sooner were they mount- i
ed, than they dashed off in quest of the
main body, and overtook therrt about 18
miles ahead. They all returned in the
morning, and when they had reached
within 200 yards of the camp, they got a
glimpse of Simpson at the door of his
tent, and immediately afterwards heard
a report of a gun; supposing.that he was
determined to cariy out the work of des- J
traction which he began, they attempted
to intimidate him by filing tliree volleys

proached it cauticusly. When they came'
up, they found their commander welter-'
ing in his blood, and on closer examina- j
tion found that he had litefally blowa his!
head to pieces! ^' ... '
' Far in the wild, unknown to public
view,' were the three bodies committed
to the same grave by their companions,
who then pursued their route, with feelings
more easily conceived than described.
The party arrived at St. Peters about
the 1 st of July, in possession of the important
papers, and other property belonging
to the ill-fated Simpson.

Many persons are just planting Turnips,

I IRISH POTATOES.
: Dr. McLean:
I Dear Sir,?Some few weeks since I
saw in the columns of your paper an ac
count of some tine Insn potatoes presented
to you by Mr. A. P. Lacoster weighing
from 10 to 12 ounces. I have raised
a considerable quantity this summer
weighing from 14 to 16 ounces, and measured
from 10 to 11 inches in circumference.
My mode of raising them is as
follows. The latter pak of February, I
make trenches about 10 or 12 inches deep,

' place and scraping them out with a hoc.
In these tienclics I put a small quantity
of stable or other strong manure, drop the
j potatoe and fill the trenches with half rot;
ted straw or trash from the woods or barn|
yard. I then level the ground, and scatter
leaves or other trash about four or five
I inches deep all over the surface, which
Jteeps the ground moist and prevents the
weeds and grass from growing. I have
no trouble of working them afterwards.
I have tried different modes of making
potatoes, but this is much the best. If
you tlrnk the above worthy of a place in
the columns of the Farmer's Gazette, it is
at your disposal.

trumpeted a great man; u woum nut m>
for any but a great and wise man to be their
candidate fur President; and according to
order, his name is shouted to the "reverberate
hills" as the second Washington, the
great General and statesman, patriot and
Republican. This ell sounds strange-?
General Harrison a very great man! A
new and wonderful miracle has occurred,
,if Whig authority be proof.
When the northern Whigs nominated
Gen. Harrison at the Harrisburg Convention,
the news, as it spread Southward,
sounded like a death-knell to their faith- j
ful allies. They almost universally gave
up the ship, and sunk into the lowest deep
of despair. Such was their estimate of
Gen. Harrison's political character, his
old Federal principles, his votes for the
Tariff and Internal improvements, his settled
opinion and wishes in regard to Abolition,
his perfect connexion with the consolidation
views of Webster, his entire
approval of that statesman's constitutional
doctrines, which, if carried into practical
operation, would convert our Government
into a central despotism, wielded by corruption
and the spirit of legislative pi tin-1
der; they diJ not think it possible, in the
nature of things, that any considerable
portion of the Southern people could be;
deceived into his support. The leaders of
the Southern Whigs therefore regarded
themselves as routed and utterly banished
from the hope of regainiug the vantage
ground which they occupied under Henry,
rhv. a man of known powers and great- j
ness, who, though tainted with Federal!
principles, was beyond comparison, in all!
respects, superior to the hero of Tippe-'
canoe.
The leading Southern opponents of the
Administration, although Harrison's nomination
was seen and rued by them as an
event that brought them "sad overthrow
and foul defeat,"like Milton'schiefs of fallen
spirits. "The prime in order and in
might" in Washington assembled their afflicted
compeers to consult how they could
best remedy the mischief occasioned by it;
" llu ir own loss, how repair, how overcome
this dire calamity." They knew they had
"a sham hero" and an established Federalist
for their nominated chief, and whilst
the pebple looked upon him as he was,
" their final hope" would be " flat despair."
They therefore determined to arouse, as it
was evident they must, or remain "forever
fallen," and to make a general onslaught
upon the Administration, and at the same
time, by a concerted and well understood
system of puffing and exaggeration, to convert
an imbecile old man into a hero and

statesman of unrivalled gfefetness, second
only td Washington. -THlybavc taken off
his Abolition taint, fend represented him
as a thorough friend of the Southern interest.
They hare invented and manufactured
a Republican cloak and , thrown
around the old gentleman's threadbare
Federal dress, and hid his black cockade.
They have taken his old epaulets, never
the brightest, upon which the dnat of time
and oblivion was settling and had almost
obscured, furbished them up, sprinkled a
new glory upon them, and sent him forth
a new hero, bright as the herald Mercury,
new lighted on a heaven-kissing hill."
And old General Harrison, who " has wasted
more blood and treasure tbaiv any individual
living," and who sa fortunately re.:

of the war, which was conferred on the
really heroic Jackson, is now recommended
to us as a fit and proper persen to preside
over the Administration of every department
of this mighty Republic, civil
and military! To be, under the Constitution,
the commander-in-chief of the whole
Army and Navy of the United States; to
superintend oitr negocialions with every
nation; to direct our.Navy to every sea; to
protect our commerce, and to take care
that the Constitution be not violated?-Yes,
' to take care that the Constitution be not
[ violated, which we are told to expect from
a man uho has advocated almost every
unconstitutional measure anu principle ui
which the South has complained, and who
j will undoubtedly be swayed by that Northern
party from which flows nothing but
infractions of the Constitution, and cease'
less attemptsJo enlarge the Federal powers
by construction.
The leading Southern Whigs have not
the hardihood to deny, that when Harrison
was first nominated they deemed him
quite unfit for the office of President. It
is said they have changed by inquiring into
his character. Are we to be deceived
1 by such assertions! No?they have changed I
I because they thought we could be operated
I on by them to change likewise. Harrison
is the same man he was last winter,
! and all the change which has taken place
* .1 .1 -
, in jiim is hi ins supposed cuauccs mi success.
The partial advantage gained by
the Whigs in Virginia in the last Spring
elections?an advantage gained by the
most unscrupulous misrepresentation ofj
the President and his party, bv moans of
a legion of false documents sent among
| the people by the "Executive Committee"
at Washington, composed in part of Abolilionists
and Hartford Convenlionists,
j was the first event tliat sharpened the eyesight
of the Southern leaders to the me!
riis of Gen. Harrison. They began then
to think that there was a chance to hum(
bug the people; and if this could he ef;
fectually done they miglit escape from the
! sad overthrow which Harrison's nontiua!

I nrice. st Smith ('arolina Senntnr lends the'
way. "Among his followers" "in shape
and gesture proudly eminent," his high
praises of Harrison have been echoed by
his males, a new song has been put into
their mouths, and now the late incompetent
and objectionable General Harrison
is held forth us altogether capwblo and acceptable?the
Ethiopian his changed his
skin, and the Leopard his spots.
Now, it needs no sagacity to determine,
' that any other man in the United States
who might have been nominated by the
Ilarrisburg Convention, would receive the
support and the ardent support, of that
portion of the Southern Whigs who advocate
Harrison's election. Any other North

declare, in preference to the Administra'
tion, which is the more disliked by them
as it has been unfairly represented, and ill
seems in proportion to the exhibition of
the most demonstrative proof of its possessing
Southern principles. Any other
Northern Whig candidate who might possess
the least chance of being elected,
would commapd the zealous partizans of
Harrison, who have sent his praises from
Washington into every hamlet, with accompanying
abuse and misrepresentations
of the President and his measures.
The same attempt to excite and convulse
the Southern States with political electioneering
would be attempted by them |
were Harrison in liis grave, or had never I
been in existence. It is a struggle* for!
power which the Harrison leaders are '
making?an effort to overlhruw the Administration,
right or wrong, and to substitute
any other in its place, so that baffled
ambition may be gratified, and cherished
political malignity revenged by the
overthrow of men more successful tban
themselves, and whose measures have met
with the approbation and support of the
people.
The days of miracles arc past, and the
people will very naturally mistrust this
sudden illumination of the minds of the
Harrison leaders. They will inquire why

It IS, ll ucn. Harrison uu kui^ uic great
and conspicuous man which he is represented
to bp, that such utter darkness covered
his opinions and his political character till
a few months past, that they looked upon
him as entiicly unworthy of Southern
support. If Gen. Harrison had been the
great luminary which some of his supporters
affirm, how happens it that men who
have been watching the political eky for
twenty years, nave never seen tus lignt in
the firmament? Not a ray ol' his greatness
ever twinkled upon the vision of his South*
em worshippers till Virginia was bamboozled
with the hard cider philosophy.

GENERAL HARRISON.
As the elections which are now going on the different
states, seem tb indicate a pretty strong current
in favor of Genor&l Harrison, every thing in relation
to his past history and character, becomes more
deeply interesting. In order, therefore, as far as lies
I in our power, to spread as widely as possible, the information
which we have fathered from different
sources, and which we think may tend to develope
his character and princ'plcs,- (Qnere?) we invite the
attention of our readers to the following bri?foztreets.
After reading the first of the verios, no one can doubt
hut the old gentleman has alwas been a stem. Jeffcr
Bjuian Republican. Ilero it is:?
John Randolph openly in the Senate of
the United States in 1820, charged Gen.
Harrison with being "an open, zealous,
frank supporter of the Sedition Law and
Black Cockade Administration." To which
Gen. Harrison replied?
"The gentleman had no means of
knowing my political principles, unless
he obtained them in private conversation.
It is very probable he might have heard
me express sentiments favorable to th?
then Administration. I certainly fell
them." &c. ?
The two succccd'ng extracts show the estimation in
which his services were held by the Senate of the
United States, and the light in which he viewed it*
proceedings.
_ .J
In the Senate of the United States, upon
the consideration of a joint resolation
awarding the thanks of Congress and me
dais toJMajor General Harrison and Gov.
Shelby, a motion was made to strike oat
the name of Major General Harrison, and
carried in the affirmative. ?[See Jlilea*
Register, page 125, vol. 10.
" A vote of the Senate of the United
States has attached to my disgrace which,
I am convinced, no time or effort of mine
will ever be able to effiice. Their censure
is indeed negative, but it is not, on that ^
account, the less severe."?See HarrisQn's
