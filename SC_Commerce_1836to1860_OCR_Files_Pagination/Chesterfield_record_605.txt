The>Anrriual Message of tho President,
delivered on the second day of the week,
disappointed the Whigs, we rather think,
qjite as m tcli as iheir opponent, though j
in ii different way. ' The Whigs found it
tree from some exceptions which they
had anticipated, whilst their antagonists
' were taken ifl aback Ufipn discovering itto
lean apparently towards Whig instead
Locofoeo principles. The great head of
the tatter party in the senate led otf
against it at once. And the assault has
been followed up in the official paper of
the same party with an earnestness which
shows deliberation of purpose. What
the Whigs in Congress have to say of ,
no debate has yet token place to disclose.
They do not. mean, probably, to
express any very hasty opinion on the
subject.
j The documents accompanying the Message
are voluminous, (though not more so
than usual,) and are not yet nut of press so
as to be submitted to examination by the
members; which circumstance, and ahsence
of a number of A/embors not yet
arrived, has prevented cither House from
making further progress in husines than,
in the House of Representatives giving authority
to the speaker to appoint the standing
committees on matters of special in
terest, viz on the plan of finunco recommended
in the President's Message; on
the apportionment of Representatives to
Congress,on the Smithsonian legacy; and
on the establishment of a National Foundry
for ordinance.
The proposition and vote upon the first
of these committees is the only indication
of the disposition of the members of
fhe House of Representatives touching the
tiiHh? iil recommendation which forms the
most conspicuous fmture of (he Pres.dent's
Mefs.ige. The House has determined, by a
I majority, of thirty votes, that 'his question Shall
not (to to the standing committee on finance*
(the VVay.e and Means.) but to a select com.
mit tee. Tne reason of this decision is suoD<ised
to l>? a di&poaitjnn on the part of the
House to place this question in the hands of a
committee so constituted as to be reasonably
-supposed friendly Jhi the President's recommendation,
rather than in *he hands of a coin,

wou d in ail probability, be, of a majority of
hose commuted, by their reiterated votes at
he iast Congress, in favor of a National Bank
n preference to a Fiscal Agent of any other
ha'aeteror construction. That such will be
he iff ct of this decision by the House, we
have no doubt. The other three select committees
ordered to he appointed arc charged
with subjects each of substantial importance*
and deserving of special inquiry. ,

mutiny ajid murdkr.
The following are the particulars of a
shocking and horrible revolt at sea, by .0
nnmhier of slaves. They are confirmed
by a letter from the commander of tbe
vessel on board of which the slaves were
embarked. .
The brig Creole, Cap:. Enkon, of Richmond,
bound for New-Orienn* with a
cargo of tobacco,' one hundred and thirty,
five slaves and four or five passengers
was on the 7th tilt., taken possesion of by
the slaves who rose and mutinied?killing
and wounding several white persons.
It appears that on the 7th tilt-, at 8 P. M.
the brig was hove toin the belief that she
was approaching Ahaco. The next day
after the passengers and crew not on duty
had retired, at alio it half past 9 P. M.,
the slaves mutinied, anil murdered a
passenger named Howell, owner of a por-'
j turn ot the stares, hy stubbing him with n
howie knife. Thoy wounded the captain
and one of the hands dangerously, the
chief mate and another of the hands severely.
But little defence could be made,
as the victims were totally unprepared
for an attack, and. had but one musket
on hoard, while the slaves . w??re armed
with pistols, knives, and bludgeons made
by cutting up hand spikes. There is reas<>n
to believe, .that the whole plot was
arranged before they left Richmond.
Having ohtainod possessing of the ves!
sel. they broke opun the trunks and ransacked
the whole cargo. They spared
I >he lives of the mate, passengers, and a
i
-rr?~
part of the crow, on condition they should ; 1
be taken immediately to Abiro an * English
inland.. Forced to obey, the.crew set |j
nil and arrived at Nassau, N. ?<, on (ho ^
9th tilt. On landing. the American Con- ?*(
sul bad. the captain and two of the men fan
immediately taken on shore and their i*'
wounds dressed* while every attention was *1'
paid to the wounded on board.. The -'
.Consul likewise requested the Governor
o,f N. Providence to place a ^ guard on -
board.to prevent the slaveafrom going a cai
shore* gs tie well knew that-if this were H*
not done, it wonl.L tie impossible to secure w?i
tbegyilty. perpetrators of. the murder. *h(
The request of the Consul was granted, ^
and,an investigation of the affair was con. Hl
auciea oy *iwo mnzisiraies 01 nawnu.
The caplaiq also look ihe testimony of tho h<
.passengers and crew. . Nineteen slaves p(
were identified as having participated in h-i
f the mutiny and- murder. Thev were e'r
plfto^d in confinement until furthero-der*. jj1
the Governor refusing to have them s mt j 1
to America under the ci'CU'iistance*. W(

{i*. passengers, having the right to land inj

fell and .miII probably recover. .
The refusal of the British authorities to g
deliver the wretches implicated in this a-1 ho
trAeuids transaction, to the jurisdiction of' D*
fhrf country inf which thoy are held as j
slaves, adds another item to the dark cat.
catogueof outrages uon Arperi an right,
committed by the English Government
It will, we trust, form an important feature ^
in lite deliberations of Congress on the |h
subject of the grievances which American p,
property and American citizens hnve k
suffered through the arrogance atid des 1!*
potism of the minions of the British
crown. The trite adage that thero is a
point beyond which forbearance rinses ,ie
to become a virtue, was nevei more applicable
than to the tame and spiritless
manner in which our diplomatic intercourse
with Great Britain in regard to
her haughty assumptions of power over
the flag and property of this confederacy ^
has bean conducted. Better, a dozen
wars with all their attendant horrors, than ;

which become more odious and exacting
in proportion to the humility with which
they fcre endured. [Bcc
It i* stated that the slaves on hoard
the Creole were insured for $120 000. but
as there was no clause in the policy pro.
vidingfo. indemnity in case of mutiny,
the amount cannot be recovered.

and a'colored man cook, of the barque tl
Baptist* Afezick, were arrested in Phila. j h
ddphin a few days since, on the charge of "
having abducted a slave from New Or.
leans.' 44 It appears," says the U. S. Gaz- :i
ette,'"that in concert with the cook, the t<
mate smiii/trled the slave aboard at New
Orleans, kept him concealed daring the ^
passage, and on arriving in Delaware si
Bay, aided his escape. The requisition ii

A fellow, was recently brought up in
Vickttburg/on ? charge of stealing two

asked what he had to say in his defence
he replied boldly that it was a "free country,"
and that he had a right to a coat !
This proposition, evident- as it was, not

the Mayor, the fellow finally offered to f
compromise thn matter by surrendering jh
