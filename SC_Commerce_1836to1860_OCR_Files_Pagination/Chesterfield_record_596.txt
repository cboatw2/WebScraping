very few of them, on our best lands, whr
can realize this much, at 10 cents per lb

A very few years more, will decide out

The monotony of ordinary business
loutinc was agreeably interrupted yesterday,
(Tuesday) by a discussion on Col.
Hunt's brll to extend the Jail Bounds to i
the limits of the Judicial District. This i
bill is in essence the same with the one |
introduced by Mr. Porter' last session but
which did not pass. Col. Hunt made a (
few remarks on the policy and propriety !
of the proposed change. Mr. Rhett sus. I
tained Col. Hunt's views. Mr. Dudley, s
from 3farlboro\ in a speech of some
length, opposed the bill. He conceived
that a creditor had rights as well as a f
debtor, and that frequently the only mean9 1
to compel pnyment was nmnrceration. i
Mr. W D Porter mnde his maiden (
speech in reply to Mr. Dudley, and advo.
cated the policy, the justice, humanity
| and expediency of the hill. Mr. B F I
Perry, of Greenville, followed on the op. i
positeside and repeated the arguments of
Mr. Dudley with an interspersion of anec.
dotes more or less to the pomt, and a '
degree of ridiculf as to the eminent hardship
of a few days imprisonment. In
reply to his remarks and in vindication of f
his hill, Col. Hunt took the floor and oc. (
copied the Hoimc for some time with a |
speech of great ibiility and force. The I
question was called for immediately upon j r
tile conclusion of Col Hunt's remarks,
and carried in the affirmative, do the
s
bill was ordered to the Senate for concur.

for certain claims and expenses, to divide
the proceeds of the sales of the public
lands among the twenty-six States of the t
Union, and the District of Columbia, and j
the Territories of Wisonsin, Iowa, and
Florida, according to their respective federal
representative population, as nscer- j
tainod by the last census, to he applied by
the Legislature of the said States, to such 1
purposes as the said Legislatures may '
direct. I
And, wherein, there is no warrant for ,
this proceeding ho the Constitution of the
U, States, and from the history of the Government
could not have been one of the j
purposes for which it was formed: And .
wheras, if the Federal GovernmMtf has
the right to subsidise all theS'atm. it has ,
the right to subsidise one or more; and if ,
the States can he induced to take subsi- 4
dies from the Federal Government, they
may be taught to take them from other I
Governments.
And, whereas, the Federal Government j
cannot justify this proceeding, from the j *
excess in their Treasury, as they cotein- j '
poraneously increased the taxes, and pas- s
sed an Act for borrowing twelve millions I
of dollars: And whereas, it is best to confine
the Federal Government within the
limits prescribed in the Constitution, and 1
to leave the States to manage their own t
affairs in their own way. y

Herri's a good idea on the subject of
advertising: "If a dealer has an article a
of which he wishes to iwke a quick return 1
and consequently is willing to sell at a
small profit, he is sure to advertise it;
but if he means to make a large profit
out of his customers, he is generally sly
about it. Men and women who have
their eye-teeth cut, wiil never deal at a
store where they do not advertise." Remember

made the very notable discovery, that "if
the Federal Government has the right to
subsidise all the States, it has the right to
subsidise one or more ?that ia, the
whole includes the several parts.
VVe cannot but feel somewhat aurpriiied
at the very serious apprehension entertained
by Honorable Senators that the
"highminded chivalrous little State of
South Carolina" is in market, ready to
be subsidised by bribes from the "Federal
Government" or any "other Governments?"
Do Senators feel themselves,
and believe their constituents to be tub*
sidiseablel Or is their jealousy only for
the purity of other States?
Three Senators voted against the bill on
its passage, viz: Messrs. Gnuse. Hagood
and Verdier. Mr. Murdock, who was
absent, afterwards asked and obtained
leave to record his vote against it.
Mississippi bonds.?Unusual interest
is fell in the result of the late state election
in Mississippi, because one of thw
questions on which the election turned
was, whether the state would pay
or repudiate her own bonds. And the
party opposed to paying them has sue.
reeded hy a majority of several 4)
thousand votes. This most disgraceful*
und dishonest refusal of a single state,.
by her popular vote, to pay her just debts
iias very materially affected the credit of
the state*, and will inflict a severeblow
upon the character of the country ,
i broad. Many holders of other ttfalfr
docks arc alarmed, and anxietto to soil,
while dealers in stocks are afraid' of
them. The consequence if a depreciav

State Stocks generally will ultimately ho

State debts are mere debts-of honor.
They cannot l>e rceoveredl by suit

Like most- swindlers, lite anti-lwndfiaycrs
in Mississippi set up pretexts in
justification of their dishonesty. They
illrge frauds in the execution und sale of
the bonds; which, they say, justify
lusal to pay them. The facts, so far as wt
have been able to collect them from the
iiflferenr publications on the subject which
have fallen under our notice, are ns follows.
Tile Legislature of Mississippi passed
in art in. 1837 incorporating the Union
Bank of Mississippi. This net authorized1
bonds of the state to be issued to the ^
imount of ten millions of dollars, p-ivnhle T
in current money of the United States,
it.snch place as might be named in the
indorsement on the bonds severally ?
Hie honds wore fo be delivered to the
Bank, and the Bank was empowered to
<ell thcin at par, and at an interest not
wceeding five per cent per annum, pay.
ible half yearly. The money to l?e realZed
from the honds was to he paid into
he Bank, for the purpose, we suppose, of
instituting its capital, though that fact
s not mentioned in the statements before
is. Nor is it materinl, inasmuch as it ik
Mated tiiat according to tUc act of the Le. *
islaUire the money was to be pawl into
he Bank. The bonds weveduly executed
md passed over to the Bank by the Go'A*
;rnor of the Slate, for the purpose of beng
sold. The amount of $5,000,000 of
he bonds was sold by the Bank, in Au.
just 1838, to Nicholas Biddlk, then
President of the U. S. Bank of Pennsylvania;
the bonds and interest made payable
at the agency of said Bank in London,
n Sterling money of Great Britain, at the
ate of four shillings and six pence to the
lollnr; the purchase money payable in five
qual instalments, the last in less than a
rear after the date of sale. The money
i as all paid into the Union Bank of Mi*
issippi, according to contract, and as
cquired by the law authorising the.sale
f the bonds. The bonds are now held
n Europe, and are guaranteed by the
Jnion B.ink of Mississippi and the (J. S.
Sink of Pa. But both those securities
ave fa led, and the State, who is the
rmcipal, refuses to pay; so that the
oljers of the bonds are likely to lose the A
rh'ole amount. *
Since the late election in Mississippi,
Jovernor McNuft of that S:ate, the leader
f tho "anfi-bonu" party has published a
taiement in the Richmond Knquirer,
ettinc forth the grounds on which he and
n ~
is party object to the State's paying
ither the interest or princip;>l of the
mncy which she borrowed. For the
ransnction was really and literally nothng
more or has than borrowing money.
1 The first reason assigned by the
iovernor against paying the money is
hat in the sale of the bonds they are nude
ayable "in Sterling money of Great
Ir.tain," and not "in current money of
