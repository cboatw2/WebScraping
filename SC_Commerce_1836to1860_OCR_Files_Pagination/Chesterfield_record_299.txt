[London paper.
from the n. v. evening post.
The Amistead-?It is understood, that
the Spanish Minister has already made a
demand upou the Federal government for
the negroes brought in this vessel, as the
property of Messrs. Luiz and Monies?
This demand may impose a very painful
duty upon the President, if the Spanish law
gives a good title to the pretended owners
of these slaves.
A letter in the Journal of Commerce yes
tcrday morning, from Mr. Tappan, assumes
T that there is no treaty stipulation on the
subject between this coumry and Spain.
* Tins is we believe, an entire mistake. The
treaty of 1795 (E'liot.'s Diplomatic code.
Vol. I, pp. 394?396.) between th<* United
States and Spain contains this express provision
:
*' Art. 6 Each party shall endeavor, by
all the means in their power, io project an-/
defend all vessels aud other effirts belong
ing to the citizens or subjects of the other,
which shall be within the extent of their jurisdiction
I y sea or by land and shall use all
their efforts to recover and cause to be restored
to the right owners, their v< ssels^and
effects, which may have been taken from
them within the extent of their said jurisdiction,
whether they are at war or not with the
power whose subjects have taken posses,
ion of the said effects."
4 Art. 9 All ships and merchandise of
what nature soever, which shall be rescued
out of ihe hands of any pirates or robbers
on the high seas, shall be brought into some
port of either state, and shall be delivered
to the custody of the officers of that port, in
order to be taken care of, and restored en.
lire to the true proprietor, as soon as due
and sufficient proof shall be made concerning
the property thereof."
And the treaty of 1819 thus confirms
these stipulations.
"No. 12. The treaty of limits and navigation,
of 1795 remains confirmed in all
and each one o! its articles, excep:ing the
2,3,4,21, and the second clause of the
22d article, which having been altered by
-this treatv. or haviri? received their entire
? ? y ? " ry ~ ex<
cutiou, are no longer valid."
Unless therefore, this treaty has expired
or has been mod,fica by some act, of which
we are no: aware, the m titter appears to
como back to where it was left by our Correspondent
Veto the other day, and that is
the Spanish law. The Spanish minister
claims these negroes as the property of
Messrs. Ruiz and Mont >s. The first question
is?are they legally claimed J VV ill
the laws of Cuba, permit Africans illegally
imported to be legally held in slavery, and
that too, where the purchaser, knew them
to be illegally imported.?1The proposition
appears almost to carry with it its denial,
but, nevertheless it may be that it is to be
answered in the affirmative, and if so, we
do not exactly see on what ground our government
could justify a refusal. If Cingu? z
and his comrades aie slaves in the eye of
the law, they are robbers and pirates also
in the same point of view, although they may
have been merely engaged in just attempt to
regain that liberty of which they were unjustly
deprived.
A Great Story.?It was stated in the
Gazette that $5,000 had been offered and
refused for a mulberry tree now standing m
Belchertowu. The owner of the tree has
since sold one-quarter of it for 10.0U0!
Buds are sold for $5 apiece. These are
stated by credible men as facts, and are belipvwl
hv them tr? he such. The owner of
the tree is a Mr. Sharp, of Connecticut,
and the tree is familiarly termed, and very
properly, wo think, the sharp tree.
There is anoiher tree of the same kind,
it is said, in Brookfi? ld,one.quarter of which
has been sold for $2,250. It is strange
how mulberry.mad men will run.

A MONSTROUS HAIL STONE.
We were shown, on Saturday, the re.
mains of a hug* (mil stone, which was picked
up soon after a very serious hail storm, in
the vicinity of Jefferson City. It was found
by Dr. Henry, of Jefferson City, aboutfour
miles out; and after carrying it ihat distance
it weighed one pound and a quarter, and
measured thirteen and a half inches in circumference
! T. B. Smith Esq.,of Arrow
Rock, in this State, believing it the largest
stone ever found, was curious enough to
procure a bucket, ice and blanket,and bring
it to St. Louis, whither he was going; and
after arriving here m the stage, wiih his
mammoth stone, it measured 11 inches in
circumference, four days after the storm !
We rather guess that this can't be beat.
Mr. Smith also informs lis that the storm
was unusually terrific and violent?that the
ground was literally covered with s'ones.
and ili.it very many were found two hours
after thes orm that measured from two to
four inches in circumference.

THE CHIMPANZEE.
The arrival and exhibition of a Chimpanzee,
-- 'L- ,f U..II will rpHainlv
iU me .tia&uiuv; nail, >> UUI viV, ^
be a very fitting occasion for us to g ve an account
of this animal.
This Chimpanzee was captured in the interior
of Africa, about 120 miles from Grand Bassa, in
the dense portion of its native forest. It was
taken by shooting its mother while she was
nursing it.
Tho Chimpanzee ranks higher than the Orang
Outang, both in bodily and intoliectual faculties.
The Orang Outang is a nativo of Sumatra, Borneo,
and other places of the Indian Islands, but
the Chimpanzee is a native of the western coast
of Africa.
Of the physical diffrences between these
animals the lower limbs of the Chimpanzee arc tho
largest and fi. meat. The Orang Outang is organized
for arboreal habits, and so indeed is the
Chimpanzee, but still it is not so exclusively
organized as the Orang Outang. The palm of
the feet or hinder hands may be fairly applied to
the ground, and the hip-joint is securod by the
internal ligament as in man. Tho arms reach
only a little way elow the knee, and both the
hands and feet are broad, short, and have less of
the hook-like character so remarkable in the
Orang Outang.
The skulls of the two animals differ material,
lyj There is a ridge in tho Orang Outang,
"beginning above each orbit, at the angle of the
temporal bone, and passing obliquely upwards,
meets at the top where the frontal bone ioins the
parietal bones, and forms a bold, strong keel, (as
in the H,ona.) But in the Chimpanzee there is
no ridgo along tho skull, which is small and of
an oval figure, with a marked supraciliary projeetion."
Tho expression of the face of the Chimpanzee
we are describing is very solemn. lis hair is
black, while that of the adult Orang Outang is
red. The stature of the full grown Chimpanzee
is four feet four or five inches. The white beard
spread over the muzzle, augments its appearance
of solemnity, and gives quite the indications of
grave old age; and we think it has correctly
been described "as much resembling an old, bent
diminutive negro." its checks are docply furrowed
; and by its examining every object presented
to its view with great consideration and
thoughtfulness, the most casual spectator is
amused with the philo?ophic-like gravity of its
aso :ct and demeanor. It is the only living spo
ciincn in America. At the London Zoological
Gardens, we believe, they have a young Chimpanzee.?Philadelphia

For the information of readers who intend to
purchase Moras Mullicaulis trees or cuttings,
and who are therefore interested in the price, we
Mnv. from week, statements of the most irapor. (
(
tant snleB reported. The latest which we have
seen, and the largest which has ever taken place
in the U. States, was that of Mr. Physick, near ^
Philadelphia, the report of which is copied in a
proceeding column from the United States Ga.
zette. It will be seen by referring to it that the
average price was about 12 1-2 cents per foot;
which is equal to about 2 cents per bud. For
trees planted so closely on thin soil have no side
branches worth taking into the account. Cuttings
from trees as small as Mr. Physick's
are much less valuable than those from
larger trees; for they are not so apt to grow,
should the spring prove unfavorable, nor
whon they do grow, will they produce so large
trees tho first season. But the greater number
of roots counterbalances, in some measure, this
disadvantage. Whether it will do so entirely,
depends upon the number of largo cuttings 1
afforded by tho larger trees with which the com- '<
parison made. Somo trees afford 50 buds, others '
100 or more, half an inch or over in diameter; and <
mature cuttings of this size grow almost as cer* 1
tainly, with proper management, as rooted plants( '
especially if grown themselves from roots one 1
or more years old. A lot of trees, therefore, <
which furnishes an average of 50, or even 25
such cuttings to the tree, is more valuable than
a lot of small trees with the same number of buds
which furnishes few or none, although the latter
lot contains more roots.
Mr. Physick's sale had been looked to with
interest by dealers as one which would afford
certain indication of future prices during 'he
fall season. Tite wholesale price may now be 1
considered fixtd at not less than twelve and a
half cents per foot for the present crop. Culliva.
tors have been anxious to sell; and dealers, who
know better how the supply compares with the i1
demand, and are better acquainted with the other
elements likely to affect the price, have been
equally anxious to buy. Tho result is that a very
very large proportion of the crop has passed into
the bands of dealers, or rather has been purch&s.
ed by them, and much of it paid for, months
before the time for removing it from the fields
has arrived;?a tiling wmcn uas never oeiwre
happened in this tjt perhaps any other,
with a crop involving so much capital and spread- ing
over so great an extont of territory: and
this too at a time of almost unprecedented do.
pression in the money market. In such a state
of things, it seems tc us certain that as the season
advances, and especially as planting time approaches,
tho price must advanco.
Some of our readers havo and feel no interest
in this subject. Such if they choose, may pass
it over, bearinj in mind that others arc interested
in it. Although not a prophet, nor the son of <

that county was arraigned for the murder of his

he had purchased the slave (a woman) about
eight months before her death, and treated her
so cruelly as to impair her health. On the j
morning of the day oi her death,1 e struck her
with a cudgel which ho picked up near her, for
aorae alledgcd impropriety, and felled her to the
ground, rendering her insensible for a time.

Dick, retired, and in a few minutes returned
with a verdict of murder. A more outrageous
caso we have seldom seen stated. The miserable

and a fit subject of punishment lor his brutal

the election the ballots were counted out before
the polls were closed, when it appeared that
there was a tie, each candidate having received
84 votes. Kennedy, theroupon, offered a poor
man named Woollard, with a large family, first
50 and then 100 dollars to vote for Hall. WooL

A PROFITABLE MULBERRY TREK.
A Mr. Ebenczer Warner gives in the Northampton
(Mass.) Gazette the following account
of a mulberry tree raised by him. He says ;
that about 1830 he bought some white mulberry
seed, and among the trees which grew
from it, he saw four with large leaves. One
of these he planted in the street near his
house. A mulberry dealer in Connecticut,
who'had seen it clothed with foliage last sum.
mer bought it at $50, and afterwards sold it
at $150 to a second dealer, who sold many of
the buds at $i each. About 2,500 buds were
taken from the tree during the winter and
spring and it now has prubably 3,500. The
owner has been offered $5000 for the tree and
and the product from it, which offer he refused.
The sickness in Augusta, Mobile and new

In Charleston the sickness seems not to increase,

THE AFRICAN SLAVE TRADE.
By statements made in the British Parliamerit
during the discission of the bill for the
note effect oal suppression of the Slave-trade,
i: appears that this traffic has prevailed to an
astonishing extent for the last ten years. Since
1620, Portuguese vessels a^one had beei) seized
to the number of 153, containing63*878 slaves.
How many traders under other flags were detected
does not appear. Nor can there be any
guess at the number of vessels which have escaped
with full cargoes. Dr. Lushington, in
the House ot Commons, expressed the belief
that within the period above named, Portugal
bad employed 8,000 ships in this traffic, that
a million slaves had been transported bv them,
and that, certainly, of this number, 120,000
had died. The bill under discussion provided
for the protection of officers in lier Majesty's
service from legal penalties, to which thev are,
without pri tection, liable, for seizing Portugese
vessels engaged in the slave trade. Under
the old law it appears that such vessels
rould not be Waliv seized. The bill passed
both Houses and has become a law.

last fall to deliver 100,000 Morus- Multicaulis
trees this season at 12 1-2 cents each, and
planted 300,000 buds, with a view of fulfiling
his contract; from which he has only 36,000
growing of course he has 54,000 to buy
at present prices before he can fulfil his
contract. To depress the price he set a rumor
afloat at the north that there were
5,000, OOOgrowin&'in the neighborhood of Rich
raond. This Jed to inquiries by wmcn u was
ascertained there are not more than 800.0000
A similar rumor in regard to the number
in the neighborhood of Mobile resulted in inquiries
which shewed the number within 30
miles of that city to be only a few hundred
thousand, and riot sufficient for the demand in
Alabama. A contract has since been made at
the north for 20,000 trees to be shipped to
Mobile.
morus multicaulis.
The Danville Reporter says that, a gentleman
of that vrcin ty, purchased 4000 buds of
the morus multicaulis, in February last, for
which he paid $100; and that, although the
peculiarities of the season was such, that not
more than half of them came up, he has lately
sold buds to the amount of $ir>00. And still,
estimating the buds and roots on hand, at the
prices obtained for the buds already sold, the
clear profits of his speculation, will amount to
more than $3,5< 0. If this be so, and we have
no disposition to doubt it for a moment, the
mulberry business is not to be grinned at, by
those who have no teeth ! Ten. Whig.
