You appear to suppose that it mar not be
the geniae Caterptllar which has apeared ian
-our comn fields. I am sorry to itform you
that there is no doubt on the subject; and what
Isame, that they threaten to be general. They
. are not only at my plantation on Edisto Island,
(and no doubt in other crops there) but they
-areon several plantationson Johns Island-and
I have just heard from a gentleman, recently
from the South of us. that they have made
their appearance on St. Helena; and as to their
being the genuine sorts. I know them too
well. from having been a frequent surer, to
mistake them. Every circumstabee too, at the
preent time, conspirep to favor their inerease.
ur crops are gnerally backward-thero is
snore than usual quantity of taxutiant and ten
der weed for them to feed upon, and the wea
ther is moist and sultry. 'othing can arrest
them but the most vitorous measurs-resO.
iately parsued-pon principles of an intelli
gem e and an enlghtened economy.
which is wtiling to nake an early acrifice of a
u for the safety of the remainder;-and
measures to be pursued by every plan
n rin whose fields this terrible enemy shall
. make their appearance. The plan is, to watch
them closely; to meet theevil at the begiuning;
and aempt to destroy them whilst their num
bers are limited-and they are found only in
certain spots in our field. .
It appears to me. ifer one would do this
at the firat appearance of tcaterpillar, at the
frst and seod brood, before they spread over
the fields, that they could be so much lessened
as to do little injury, if they cannot be entirely
u ed; and rurely no reasonable sacri6e
be considered too great. or any trouble
too much. to save to us the fruits of all our
pevious labour of the year."
