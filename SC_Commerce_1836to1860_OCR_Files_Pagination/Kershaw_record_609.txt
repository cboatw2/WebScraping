posture of parties inoongress.
There is unusual mystery observed by the
Federal majority in Congress, in regard to the
regulative action they.moan to adopt. They are (
as reserved now in the development of their1'
projects, as they were, before the election which
brought then into power, of their principles.? [1
We have nothing now, emanating from their 1
caucuses, ushered into either branch of ConK
grcss, designed to carry out the system so bold- '
ly broached at the extraordinary session. The '
late expression of public opinion at the polls, '
throughout the Union, has operated like a '
powerful spell on Federalism, and, for.the mo- 1
roont, thrown it into a trance. The leaders !
* _ kno\r that all they have done, and all thev
* wish to do, is utterly abhorrent to the will of f
the great body of the people. The effort of the '
extra session to anticipate the public opinion, '
and bind it in the toils of a strong network of ]
irrevocable measures, has failed. Distribution '
?and Debt?$nd Bankrupt laws?and new impositions^pf
ta^es^-and proposed Bank charters, 1
all driven ^through Congress by forced legisla- !
" tion, haveynot "had the effect to seduce o** to
$ overawe the sound principles of the country.? 1
The reaction of strong feeling against this load
of measures has already struck them loose, and 1
r there is an apprehension among those who pat 1
on this burden, which makes them hesitate to {
renew the attempt to fasten them bv new cords
on the people. Hence the pause now visible in
k' the course ot the reoerai majority m ^uugross.
* T .ey will, however, we predict, soon renew
their opera'ions. We see evident signs to i
build up tha* tiortion of 'he sys'em, the most '
v' formidable of all?the outer walls of winch i
have been long levelled by the will of the na- '
v. * tioa, but in regard to which there has been no i
recent demonstration to ex-cite alarm in the J
contrivers. The old ultra rarffF for protection, I
or, in other words, for prohibitition, will instant^
]y suggest itself as the point to which Fcd.mi.1i
ism means to devote its forces. This. !ij.o a '
^eW long thrown out to fallow, the friend.privileged
classes may now think is in condition
again to afford a good crop lor those whom they j <
'< A would favor. It will suit well, too, to int roduce i.i
/' this as a part of their American System?a m. i
tation of crops for capitalists and political speculators?Inasmuch
as the Bank field having been
thoroughly worn down to sterility, it is indispensible
to turn it out for a time to recuperate.
The people having endured to the last degree of i
.tini.ojinn tl?p inv of Bank frauds, shavinsrs.
usurie?, robberies and all, an immediate tax on
the necessaries they consume, in food and raiment,
miisttake the place of the paper money I
* oppression. This will relieve tho corporations i
?' lor a time, and so enable thctu to take the'
stronger hold hereafter.
The Federal majority in both branches in
Congress, conscious that they do not represent j
the majority of the respective districts from |
which they come, will feel their way to their!
present purposes with mere of caution than;
characterized them at tho late session. While j
flushed with the triumph of the hard cider i
campaign,, they boldly hazarded battle iu open ;
field. The reverses overy where encountered!
in .the late elections have convinced thorn that, j
'* whenever they-unvfeil their principles to tho |
defeat ie the consequence. They public, eye j
* wttl no;v betake themselves to the'.- coverts,And j
the Democrats must look out tor ambuscades ,
(. f and surprises.
The party In the minority in Congress were ;
.: never so well iuionued as to the interests and i
wishes of tho country, nor mere thoroughly j
united in inclination, nor as toTJle means proper j
to, promote its objects. They kr.ow; tiiat ir.e

The nomocracy is aware, that, with the reti'nnpln.inti!

t'oration of the true standard of value?to be ob- J
taineJ only by the riddnicc of the rotten banks, j
and the resumption of specie payments, by the
srwmd. ohoir. The means ol' effecting this,
through t!ie instrumentality of the General
Government, is obvious to all, and it would be
quickly applied by the Democratic party, if thevoiec
of t lie majority of the people prevailed in
Congress.
The Democratic majority in Congress is well j
apprised, too, that the people are not willing to j
see the tax increased upon consumption beyond :
the one-fifth of its whole amount, to which it J
may he raised now under the compromise act.?_j
Tint, 0:1 the contrary, they desife to have it re
d.rcd, and especially on those necessaries of
life, to lav vhich is to levy a revenue upon the
heids of the people, making the rich and the i
p.x>r j : >' alike, and not in proportion to their
or their property, "which Government is
ystabLsb-d to protect. To accomplish this, the

tone oould bo restored to i', and nut distributed
in v olation of the Constitution, to put at
the disposal .of ihe speculators in the State Le
gislatures, funds which they dare not take the
responsibility of levying immediately from their
constituents. ; j
The Democracy are conscious that public
sentiment was never more propitious than at this j
moment to the restoration of the Government'
to the pure, primitive, simple system written 1
out in the Constitution, but invaded in its very
origin by the daring genius of Hamilton. We
believe there is not at this time a single individual
among the gifted men who stand preeminent
in the Democratic party in Congress, 1
and whose genius and virtue surround it with i
lustre, who arc not animated like Mr. Jefferson i
with an' ardent enthusiasm to bring back the I
General Government to its true character; and j
by renovating its principles, ensure its perpe-. <
tuitv, and the blessings it is so well calculated i
to confer upon the country. This we sincerely 1
believe to be the ruling passion which reigns in ' i
the bossotns of the Democracy of the two t
Houses. But what can the Democratic party i
in Congress do] It is in a minority of some <
forty in one end of the Capitol?of some eight J
or ten in the other. The list of committees will i
show that- the Democratic minority in the !
Houses, though representing a vast majority <
in the country, are excluded from all power in
those bodies which originate the business of ]
Congress. (
In to-morrow's Globe we shall exhibit the !
organization of the important committees in a

Correspondence of the Charleston Courier. . :?
Washington, Dec. 17. i;3
The Senate did not 6it to-day. The House *
net, and was engaged all day in debate on the "
Tariff question. Mr. Wise attempted, iu the a
norning, to draw the attention of the House to P
i?" necessity of despatching the private business. 0
ile said it lnd been neglected .'or four years.? a
[tut ihe Speaker decided that the rules setting ki:>i::

can approach il with a claim. Congress J
cannot and will not Attend.to there, and yet they
refuse in establish a judicial tribunal with pow- t
L*r to adjust these claims. t
Mr. Jones, of Va., spoke, at some length, on S
the subject of the reference of so much of the (
President's- Message as relates to the Tariff. He i
contended that, as there was now but one source
of revenue for the Federal Government, viz: the I
Customs, it was necessary, in order to meet the t
demands of the government, to arrange the du- t
ties with a view to revenue alone. If the ob- i
ject of the duties was protection and not the t
revenue, there might be better reasons to refer >
the subject to the Committee on Manufactures. r
If twenty millions were to be raised from duties, >
the Tariff must be adjusted with a view to reve- t
nue and not to protection. lie contended that;'
the President, in his Message, did not intend to. t
recommend even an incidental protection?if he 11
did he differed from him entirely.
Mr. Jones was replied to by Mr. J. R. Inger- <
soil, Mr. Hunt, and others, who contended 1
for incidental protection, and that the President ]
had recommended iti" j
The discussion was not closed, but will be i
continued on Monday. i

The report of the Secretary of the Treasury
was communicated tojCongress, to-day, and, in
the House, ten thousand copies were ordered to
be printed. The repoit is voluminous, and very
minute and interesting. I do not think, from
all I can learn, that the Cabinet have settled, as
yet, upon all the detailiof the fiscal agent suggested
by the President in his message. Tlie
Cabinet had a consultation upon it, on Friday,
and again oh Saturday. 1 In the course of a few j
days, we shall certiinfy have Mr. Forward's
"plan" in detail. It is strongly rumored that in-1
asmuch as the vshigsjwijl not adopt the plan, it J
is to be so altered as to suit the democrats.
The Senate did nothing but to pass the Con
gress pay bill, withoutaniendment
The Senate spent iotfie time in Executive
business, and confirmed the nominations of Mr. !
Spencer, Mr. Upshur, the new Secretaries.;
The House again took up the subject of the j
reference of that part ofthe President's message
which relates to the tariff Mr. Slade, ofVer-:
mont, who had the floor, from Friday last, deliv-1
ered an elaborate speech in support ot tne protective
system, and pave a full history of the origin
and operation of that system. Mr. S. spoke
three hours, and Mr. Skiers, of Maryland, took
the floor.

In Senate to day, the Chairannounced Messrs.

severally praying that tie Bankrupt Law of las
Session be amended.
Mr. Calhoun presented the .memorial of the
Chamber of Commerce ci Charleston on the
same subject. Also, the memorial of the same
body relative to steam ve&els of war, which he
said contained suggestions well worthy the attentive
consideration of the Rebate. Also, another
memorial from the same sburce, asking for the
establishment of a mail route from Charleston to
Memphis, which, he said, Was scarcely second in
mportance to any other route in the "United

Mr. Evans from the Comrbittee on Finance reported
without amendment the bill making apiropriation
for the pay of Members of Congress,
ind hoped that it would be acted on at once.?

vith the Comnjittee of Ways and Means, and re:ommend

LATEST FROM TEXAS.
We consider our news brought by the Nepune
yesterday, of a decidedly favorable characer,
as regards the all important subject of the
Sarite Fe expedition. We quote in full from the
lalveston Advertiser of the 6th inst, the follow-1
ns: I
We notice in the Weekly Picayune and the
tfew Orleans Bulletin a statement of the cap-1
ure of one hundred men, the advance guard of,
he Santa Fe expedition, and of their being'
narched into that city under an escort of 1,200
roops, as prisoners. All this may be true, but
ve must say we do not belive one word of it.?
The news reached New Orleans by way of Havana
and Vera Cruz, and we fully agree, with
he editor of the Picayune that it is all flummery,
rhe Mexican government have only about 150.
.roops at Santa Fe, and there is not the least i
irobability of their being able to concentrate'
1,200 troops at that remote point, during the
listurbance9 in which that unhappy country has;
jeen involved. If such an occurrence had ta- {
ken place, there is no doubt an express would;
vp. henn desDatched to Austin to tell the tale, |
md the news would have reached us by way !
sf Chihuahua and San Antonio, or St Louie, be-1
fore this time. The brig Ferdinand, just arrived J
in this harbor in 14 days count, and there is not j
the most remote probability to confirm the tale.;
From the Galveston Gazette, of the 7th, we
also extract an item that escaped the attention
of the St Louis .papers, and so has not been heard
of here before:
Captain Secres, who arrived in the Neptune,
informs us that he was lately at St. Louis, where I
he 6aw a company of American traders, who had,
left Santa Fe the latter part of September,?'
??
v ' ' . * ; * * r
.* * <
When they left, the expedition from Texas Was
daily expected, and they delayed; their departure
several days, in order to see those composing
it, though they finally left before its arrival.?
They were overtaken at the crossing of the Arkansas
by a courier, who left daring the 1st days
of October, and the expedition had not yet arrived,
through great preparations and been made
by the authorities to give it a friendly and flattering
reception^ The inhabitants were pleased
at the prospect of its arrival, and i20 opposition
had manifested tiself towards the eipeJ.'tiod at
Santn Fe. t honrrh there was arenortl,200
were to be sent from Mexico to oppose it?
Capt. S. has strong doubts of the truth of the report
that the advance guard has been captured,
and the whole story i9 highly improbable, from
the fact that the Central Government in its late
distracted state,' had not the means to send 1,200
men upon such a piece of service; and, besides,
every Texan who lias borne arms against Mexico
repudiates the idea throne hundred such men
as formed the exfleditron to Santa Fe would lay
down their arms without a contest to any Mexican
force whatever.
All this is in direct confirmation of the. position
we have all along maintained in relation to
the Texarv'enterprise, and a very Short period
must settle-the questio^yhether we have been
right or wrong. We coTOni^to cherish something
approaching veryltear tBconfidence that
our best wishes in this matterWill be crowned
with fruition. The Galveston Gazette of an
earlier date also remarks as follows, in relation
to the Mexican statement:
As this corroborates the report which has
reached us via San Antonio, it may have some
foundation, though it would differ materially
from the announcement of this kind usually
made by Mexicans, if hot grossly exaggerated.?
There is one circumstance, at least, which gives
the story an air of great improbability*?those
composing the expedition were well enough acquainted
with the Mexitan character to know
that it would be much better to die. with arms
in their hands, than to surrender themselves as
prisoners to such beings.
We shall rest easy under this Intelligence un.
till something reaches us upon which perfect reliance
may be placed. This authority, it will ^e
perceived, interferes specifically with the recent
alarm from Mexico, bearing date fifteen days later
from the same section, and having,, in our opinion,
a far stronger claim to credence.
IMPORTANT MEDICAL DISCOVERY.
c A
late number of tho London Lancet
contains an interesting report of a case in
the Middlesex Hospital the result of which
was important to the.medical profession.
A man was . admitted into the Hospitalabout
six hoursafter having taken an ounce
of laudanum, containing twenty-six grains
of opium. At the time of admission, he
was apparently lifeless, the suracc of the
body, was cold, countenance pale and
livid, lips purple pupils contracted to a
mere point, respiration scarcely perceptible,
pulse hardly to be felt. The lau
daiium was removed the stomachpump,
but in spite of every exertion, the
pulse became mure unfreiiuent, and was
aV rimes imperceptible, when recourse
was had to electro magnetism, which was
applied by means of a small batery, with
coil and cunl.ir.t hraiiar Onn uiru rif*.
applied to tire neck, ana tlte other to the
region of the heart or epigastrwn, and by
these a succession of very powerful shocks
was given. The good effects were very
apparent. The muscles of respiration
were'set in action, and the diaphragm
contracted powerfully; thechest was more
fully expanded, respiration was more perfectly
carried on, and a corresponding improvement
was observable in the countenance.
The pulse improved and became
more powerful, becomingsteady when the
current was interrupted fur a few minutes.
This application was continued for several
hours, and was finally successful?Thus
clearly establishing the influence of electro
magnetism under circumstances hitherto
considered hopeless.
