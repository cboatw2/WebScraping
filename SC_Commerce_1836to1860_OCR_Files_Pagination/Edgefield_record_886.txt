Texas.-A late arrival at New Orleans,
from Galveston, brings late dates from
Texas. Notiing of importance, except
the following papers, which throw some
light on the quarrel between Gen. Duff
Green and the President of Texas.
ThePresident of Texas and Gen. Green.
PaOCA:AToN
By the President of the Republic of Texas.
Whereas, on the 5th day of October,
1844, Duff-Green, Esq., having before
that time been duly appointed "Consul of
the Un.ted States, for Galveston," was,
by an Exequator of that date, issuel by
his Excellency, Sam Houston, then Pres
ident of the Republic of Texas, recognised
as such Consul, and, thereby, authorized
to exerciseand etijoy such functions, po
ers privileges, as are allowed to Consults
of the most. favored nations, in the Repub
lic of Texas, in which ofice the said Duff
Green is still acting.
And whereas, owing to circumstances
known to the Executive, the interests,
honor and safety of the Republic require
that the aut hbrity so extended as aforesaid,
to the said Duff Green, be revoked.
Therefore, be it known, that 1, Anson
Jones, Presidentofthe Republic of Texas,
by y,irtue of the power by law in me ves
ted, do hereby solemly revoke the exo
quator aforesaid, and tb6 same is accor
dingly revoked, with all the powers,
immunities, privileges and rights therein,
or thereby conceded, grinted or extended
to said Duff Green, as Consal, aforesaid.
Done at Washington, the 31st day of
December, 1855.
IVASHINGToN. (Texas,) Jan. 2,1845.
Dear Sir:-The President of Texas, on
taccoutt as lie alleges of private and con
fidential conversation between himn and
myself has issued his proclamation revok
ing Exequatur, recognizing me as Cunusul
at Galveston. * He is endeacoring to make
it a inatier between this government and
that of the United States, This would
be 'to play into the hends of the British
Ministcr and-favor the purposes which the
President and some of those about him are
supposed to be anxious to accomplish.
The whole matter is private and personal
between the President and myself, and i
ant tesolved that it shall remuin so. At
Proclamationhas been suspended; and an
edurt is being made by mutual frie ds to
bring abott a recotncitiation, It seems to
me that President Jones has intentionaily
sought a qdarrel without cause, if so no
reconciliation can take place, because
having taken his course under the advice
ofevil counsellors, the same iufluence will
prevail. In that case I must expect to en
counter the combined influence of the
British Minister and the President of Tex
as acting in concert for the purpose of de
feating the wish of a majority of the peo
ple of Texas and of the United States. I
am aware of the fearful odds against me.
but I ant not dismayed. All that I C-dtw
ask is that .publ.c opinion be suspended,
until I can place the facts fully belore the
country, when it will be found that, the
President of--rexas has not the slightes'
posmtte cause, or-tlte -manner in irhich-ie
has treated 'me. %
I writn this note for the purpose of say
ing in advance, that while I intend to vin
dicate my own character. I intend to do it
in my ownaway at. the proper tine-that
I will not it I can - prevent, permit the
persontal injusticie done to me, to become
the cause of a geont,rovertsy between the
two governoteqts, 95 to any way, to retard
or aff'ect the questiorn ofannrexattion, and. to
ask thte favor of-you to publish this, if in
your opinion it becomes necessary to cor
rect any erroneous imzpressions whic-h may
get abroad.
Very respectfully, yours,
DUFF GREEN.
Editor Telegraph. Houston.
To the Editor of the Register:.
Sir, the President's proclarnation revek -
ing my exequator, as Consul at Galveston,
htas given rise to tmany rumors, and as he
has said that iLt was because the interest,
honor and safety-of the Republic required
it, these rdimors are to my prejudice. A
regard for my character demands and un
qualified contradiction of the rumors int
question. It is said that I endeavored, by
tmproper means, to obtain the Executive
sancioin to the measures about wahich I
consulted him.: . So far frotm this being
true, I was acting, as I believed, in concert
with him, in promoting measures, which,
as 1 supposed, bad his cordial approbation.
The purpose of tmy last conversation,
was to consult him. on the -letails, there
being as I believed, a perfect concurrence
on the measures .themnselves. It will be
seen, therefore, that I could have-bad no
possible inducement to intimnidate or to
use any improper means to influence his
official action.
What thosem'easures are it is not no*
necessary to explain further tthan to say
that their chief was to arrest thte progress
of British influence on our westerni and
north western frontier,.and especially to
prevent their getting- possession of the
country betWeen the Nueces and the Rio
Grande for the purpose establishing there
a colony of free blacks and runaway ne
groes; experienced. having demonstrated
that their black colony in Canada, like
their abolition in Jatxaica, is a failnre. I
have many .very important facts bearing
upon this subject, wyhich it is my purpose,
ins due time, to give to the.pubhic.
Ik-arn, also, that rumor says that one
of my objects was to bring into Texas a
large body of Indians; so far from this, one
of the measure whlich I proposed was to
remove beyond our limits, the Indians that
are now in Texas-.
I repeat that I supposed thtat the Presi
dent fully concurred in my views, and
that I am bound in charity to believe, that
he acted under a misapprehension and will
yet do me the justice to say so.
As you have published the proclamation,
I ask the favor of you to insert - this like
wise, and I trust that all who po~lish the:
proclamnatioc will pvblish this note.

Civilizati~n.--A 'savage oace said tt.

wanting the. conveniences of society.
"Your whol'e life is spent in laboring for
S-.- ....s w have laned to do very well:
From the Soet Caroline.
TO THE COTTON PLANTERS.
The Cottiin Planters are perhaps th'
most uncalculating portion of human famn
ily who can pretend to civilization. There
I never was a moment when this fact was
more strikingly exemplified than the pre
sent ; it is melancholy to reflect how man.y
of then must be irretrievabyly ruined, and
how many beriously injured, by their own
oily. independent of the many other pow
erful causes at work to produce the same
effects. The Planters cannot realize from
the sale of the present crop of Cotton more
than 4 cents not per lb., the crop round.
It is admitted to be very doubtful whether
they will do better with the next, or any
future crop; and it is pretty certain tht
'cotton will never sell for any length of
time hereafter, for more than 6 cents net.
Yet see the prices which Planters are still
giving for everything they buy, and at
wbat rates they suf'er themselves to be al
lured into debt. At public sales on tiwelve
monthe-etedit, p)rime negroes will com
mand $600, for irmules'they will pay as high
as $100; and for everything else in pro
portion. And they do 'this Without the
least reflection, simply because they have
given as much or more heretofore. The
question is hov are these things to be paid
for ; or if paid for already, how is the pur
chaser to lie re-imnbursed by planting tot
ton, or any other crop we know of? The
expense of every hand on a cotton planta
tion may be estimated at $25 per annum
-even to those who purchase no provi
sions. If any one doubts this, let him set
down what he has paid oubfor Overseer's
wages. Doctor's bills. bagging, rope, iron.
salt, nails. clothes, blankets, hats, shoes,
mules, wagons, gears, hoes, axes, black
snith's and carpenter's hills. &c &c., and
divide ihe amount by his number of hands.
I have never got off under $30 per hand
myself.
For every full hand, planters. on the.
average, own at least $200 worth of land.
If any one doubts this, be can easily make
the calculation. Ile must include of course
all he lands he atens, whether under cul
itoie, in old fields. or forests. The interest
on this capital inivesied in land, isl$14 per
hand per annum : expenses 825-total
$39. If he is a good planter, and culti.
vates.good land, he may calculate per
haps 'on Parrying to market 1.500 1b'. of
ginned cotton. for each hand. I am con
sidered rather a successful planter. I think
my corops' -re over the average of the
State, and for the Iast.twelve years I have
made an average ol'a little over 1,300 lbs.
per task hand. Even ,500 lbs. at 4 cents.
will give only 660 per hand. Deduct $39,
and you have $21 elear. At the present
price of cotton, astonishing- as it may
seem. $31 per hiand is all the votton plan
ter can expect to realize ; and he must
have good laud, and manage well to do
that. I do not believe it can be done by
one planter in three. in South Carolina ;
and there is not one in a hundred who can
do better. Letevery planter lay aside his
boasting to others, and calculate the mat
ter for himself, and to himself, if he choo
ses.
Thiq suti f$31. Is the interestron $300.
And I affirm, that every dollar paid for a
prime negro., over and above that amount.
is thrown a way by lthe folly of the planter.
He can't afford to pay more. If he per
sists in doing it, his ruin is inevitable
without Abulition, or increase of the Tariff,
disunion or war-'-ust in the natural~course
of things. With cotton at 4 cents you
must sell 7,500 lbs of clean cotton to obtain
300. With cotton at 8 cents-which was
what the lait crop was probabiy sold at
-this amiount would bring $6003. So that
negroes now at '$300. are no cheaper to
the platnter thati they were at this time
last year at $4000 But lie who pturehaased
last year on t welve tnonthts credit, for $600.
will have tu p-ty how 15,000lhs. ofrcotton.
or as much as if tie paid last year 61 200
in cash At th'e very hiahest time of cut
tot-itn 1836-7, a lien miany planters'ecrotps
netted 18 cents prinme field hands might he
purchased for 61,200, or 6,666 lbs. of cot
ton-itearly 1.000. lbs. less thant will now
pay for otie 'even at $300. This shows
tat, at this apparenTy lowv estimate, they
would be really higher thatn in those limes
which we now denounce foar their reck ess
ness and extravagance.
TIlE NORVIl AND THE SOUTil.
it is not to be disguised that what is
called the "Religious Press"~ a' the North,
is, with very few exceptiotns, in close af
finity with the spirit of A bolitionism. The
cautious atnd rmeasured, and comparative
ly inoff'emiive terms, ini which they formter
ly spoke of our institutions, are exchanged
for rant and denunciations and inventive.
They meddle with every political qitestion
which is thought to have a bearing either
directly or remotely on the subject of sla
very, and throw the whole weight of their
influence itt favor of the main schemes
which the oranized Abolitionaists support.
And thotugh, at tir.aes, they affect to dis
countenance sach organientions, -'they are
themselves their most. active and efficient
coadjuturs and allies ; and the more dan.
gerous to us. inasmttch as they ard less
ipen, but not less bitter in their attacks.
As to the "Lnion" which our Fathers
formed ini the spiri4 of compromise, they
assail it without disgtuise, and laud every
attempt at its infraction, so far as the arti
cle of slavery i., concerned
Such being the tone and spirit of these
papers, it is obvious that should it contin
ue and increase, all Christian intercourse
beteetn the North and the South must
soon cease, and with. it all friendly politi
cal relations. Upon the facts here stated,
it is not necessary to make any comment

RarAaKs WURTUY OF CoNbIDERATION.
i The following remarks of the Trumbull
(Obo) Democrat, will apply to other pla
ces as well as Ohio, and we commend
them to the consideration ofour own teigh
bors andfriends. Those little think of the
injury they are doing t-ieir own purses and
neighborhnods. who refuse to sustain their

they prevent the improvement of the press,
and lend a helpiug hand to place a veil
before advautages possessed lky their own

of its resources, at the same time th'at they
curtail the usefulnesS of the press.
SUPPORT YOUR OWN COUftrT PAPER.
-We think every impartial man will ad
mit that countrypapers are not supported
as they ought to be, yet these same men, or
many of them turn their own backs on.their
own -county papers, and give their support
to) some overgrown, city paper perhaps
cheaper and larger, and containing rather
more reading atter.-We admit that in
consequence of ihe enormous patronage
these.pap'ers receive, having in sewe in
stantces over forty thousand subscribers.
instead of one thousand, which is moTe
tban tim averhge of country papers," their
pay invariably in advance, never loosing
a dollar by poor subscribers, and their fa
cilities for pinting by steat, they are
enable to furnish their paper cheaper than
we do or can, but nevertheless it se6ms to
be necessary. especially in acolitical point
of view, to have a county pape,!:and to
ha've tone it must be so'ppoitdd, ac' the
better if is supported the better-it Can ie
made. Who then will not caist mnhis
mite by subscribing for his coutsty paper.
Support that first, and then, if you.please,
support foreign papers, but don't. starve
out your printer who is doing altle can,
anti then curve him for letting his paper
run down. or not making it bettr. Give
your county paper a liberal suppof and
then if is not what it should be,"curse it,
and quit it, but not before. -

A 1Neto Enterprise.-It will he seen by
a corimunication in another column, that
the Marlboro' lauufacturing Company,
propose to the public the establishment of
a new company to be engaged inihemana
ufacture of Cotton Bagging. In a conver
sation we had a few days ago with Mr.
Townsend, the principal stockholders in
the present Company, he assured us that,
by an outlay of about $2,500, and cottoin
at'the present low rates, he could.matru
facture Bagging, weighing two -tid'to
the yard, for 15 cents a yard, or, if twilled,
a somewhat lighter article, but egually
strong at the same price. This Veduction
in the price of Bagging it appears to us,
would of itself be a matter of some consid
ration to the planter, but more especially
when it affords an additional and no in
consideration market for the consauption
of the lower grades of this stapl duc
ions
Let us enter Into a talculatiotW. and
mark the result : If cotton could be used
for all bagging consumed in the Southern
country-and we know of io reason why
it should not-say to cover 2,500,000
bales, at five yards to the bale and to
pounds to the yard, it would require 12,
500.000 yards of bagging, and 25,000,001)
lbs. of raw couon, say, in round numbers,
62.000 bales-considerahle more than the
whole crop of the Vee Dee couutry and its
tritnaries. But this is not all: the poorer
qualities, which are now scarcely worth
Cppring for shitiment, w.ould thus find a
ready market at h-ntme, and mof course to
this extent relieve the foreign mtuket of
its superabundant supplies, and still fur
ther, by diverting the labor of a portion of
our operatives into a new thannel. B~ei
sides these considerations, the Soth ~
would be saved a heavy and exharstina
draitn upon her resources, which at the
present titme cannot amcount to much less

The Star of Texas is still in tbe ascen
daut. In the Hous'e this morning. after
the rejertion ofrnometrous propositions, the
joint resolutions ol Mr. Milton Brown were
suhstitu'ed for those of the Committee on
Foreign Affiiirs, and finally passed by a
vote of yeas 102-nays 98.
The principal featores of the measure
are as follows:
A netv State is to be fdrmed outi of the
rerritory of Texias. to be called the State
of Texas. The people are to form a Con
stitntion. which shall be forwarded to the

WASHINGTO. Jan. 27. 145
1 think you shoulI have confidence in
my inthrmnation and estimates of the state
of things here. You will recollect, that I
told you that the Texas questmion would be
carried by the Squtlern Whigs, and gave
you the count of one hundred Democrats
and nine W higs for it. Thiswas the iden
tical vote, saving one, by which Mr.
Brown's Resolutions were carried in the
House, and this was the real vote by which
the question was setiled. The vote in the
House. was a vote given. after the Nor
thern Democrats land been bluffed off by
rho Whigs and bealen by their own party.
They fell into line after in vain trying to
hcak it, either by their own strength, or
by the strength ofour enemties combined
witih them. As to the Saenate-it is in a
prnfound, anti silent state of doubt. When
the opinions of Senators are expressed, I
vill he able to give you some-eformation.
I now say this, that the measure is suppo
sed to depend ve'y tmuch nt the course of
the Virginia Senators. Accordingly the
Legislature of Virginia is watched from
this plate wilh great ankiety. The two
Senators of Virginia tare understood to be
against the mecasure tat pr'esent, and Mr.
Archer, insirueted or not. So far. Mr.
IPoster from Tennessee is the only Sou
thern Whig Senator whno is decidedly in
fiavor of the mneasture sent from the H-ouise.
