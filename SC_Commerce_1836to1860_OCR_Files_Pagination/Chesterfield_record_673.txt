not much larger ?It was a pleasant summer
evening, and a group ofth j gentlemen
of the bar were standing in front of
the only tavern in the place, engaged in
discussing the news of the day, when a
stranger rode up to tin* door of the tavern
and dismounted. There was much of

into the hoifse, looking in itlier right

to tiie friendiy greetings of the gentlemen

that as Court was then sitting, and her

way proposed, hut that he could have a
room, if he would share it with another
gentleman. This he refused; and finally
became so insolent and annoying in his
rentalk> upon the want of accommodation,
that the lady sent lor (ieneral Jackson,
as one in whom she could confide,
and requested his advice. To him she
stated the case, and he desired her to
leave the matter to him I lo immediately
took a servant, and made him enter
the little log corr.-crih, rake the corn all j

up the rear. Jack led him to the hole, at
which he sh?| | ed, with very manifest
tokens of rage. " There's your room,"

A discovery has been made by Mr. It.
Prosser, of Birmingham, which b d < fa r to i
be attended with important resuts to the
interests of architecture. The n vdty of
Pressor's process consists in the clav he- |
ing dried, ground to jiovvdcr, and submit I
- * --t-i- -:i!
ted to pressure in metuiic mounts, mm: |
the particles cohere together. As t!i< re
is no water in combination with the clay,
no drying process is necessary, consequently
the articles made by tins method
are ready to he fired or burned as soon as
they leave the machine. Owing to the
gr< at pressure required to cause particles
of clay to colore together, the articles nude
!>v thi* process have greater density are 1
;il*0 less porous, and not subject to decay
in wet or frost. In addition to those advantages,
any architectural device may be
impressed upon the clav, which, when
burnt will retain all iiie sharpness of the
original, however elaborately finished.?
By this process bricks may he made in
all weathers, and with greater economy
| than by any other plan known at present.
The brick press is worked hv hydraulic
pumps, about three hundred tons pressure,
thus producing the adhesion and cohc.
sion. The machine delivers the brick
(four at a time in the present machine)
ready at that instant for the kiln, requiring
no exposure to the atmosphere to dry.
The whole operation, from the time of
putting the powdered clay into the machine
to the delivery of the brick, occupies
about half a minute. Machinery might
readily he constructed to procure fifty
bricks a minute.?Atheneum.
COMPARATIVE TART,Ft,
Showing /he money value of the agricultural
industry of the several States of the
Union.
In the September No. of Hunt's Mcr
chants' Magazine is a table, furnished
for publication in that journal by the
Secretary of State, showing the amount,
in quantity, of the agricultural products
of the Union. This table docs not, however,
include Kentucky, North Carolina,
Michigan, Wisconsin, or Florida. KenMickv
and Middle Florida had not sent
in their returns, and the aggregate from
the Southern Slates had not been made
up.
With the aid of tills table we have
ma lo an estimate of the money value o
the several products, and have placed the
result side by side with the population of'
the States respectively, to show the yield
per iicad, in round numbers.

Massachusetts is lowest in the scale, but J
that State is engaged extensively in commerce
and manufactures.
I'hc States most devoted to planting
and farming, or whose products arc chiefly
agricultural, are mostly the Southern

Revised by a Committee of Scientific and
Practical Agriculturists, belonging to the Agri- ,
cultural Society of France, under the direc- j
tiou of M.T. Bailey, Member of the Societies
of Agricultural and Horticulture. Translated

of Matt hematics, and Natural Philosophy in

Agriculture is the foundation of all bumah
/arts?the art for which man was made, and
I the perfection of which is his chief happiness
I and glory as the lord temporal of this planet*
Of this suhlime art, all oilier arts and science* i
are but satellites, their business being to wait
CM, enlighten, and adorn it with their moonshine.
Consequently no man more than the
agriculturist needs the full use of his brains,
and a perfect command of all the treasures of
human experience. So the farmers of the
United States view the matter; and in presenting
them with a translation of the cele.
brated Maison Rustiquc, of the French, we
have no doubt of their hearty support. It ic
[ the work of all works on "practical agriculture
j ?the most scientific, clear, and ccmpreheriI
sive, France has long excelled in profitable
[ farming. This is the source of her wea'th.
I England is rich by coals and commerce. Her
agriculture is splendid, but sometimes costs
more than it cotnes to. Those who have
fortunes to spend may buy the vast works of
Marshall, lhckson Arthur Young, Loudon,
' &.C., but those w ho wish to get a fortune out
of I he soil will find the French writers better
able to show them the way. The excellence
of French elementary w orks is w ell known to
all teachers. For centuries, the A/aison
Rustique has been, in Franco, the standard
elementary work?the spelling book and
grammar of larming. The present edition for
, M the nineUenlh century," has been re-written
and brought up with the 44 march ofmind,"
hy sixty of the ablest 44agronomes" of France.
II has all the light of the latest improvements,
| not only in Frauce, but in all Europe.
Wiiliatn C'obbet, one of the most successful
farmers both in England and America, who
! wrote the best stylo and the host French
grammcr that ever was, valued the Mais m I
Ru-itiqucs, not only as an encyclopedia of i
farming, but us a means of educating his j
children, lie w as his own schoolmaster. In ;
winter evenings his family resolved itself into j
a school, and he thus speaks of the use then
made of this work;?

| New Steam Boat line.
A Steam Coat Line has been formed in connrr*
tion with the new Steam Boat "Utility" and a
sett of tow Bouts at present three in number
others will bo added as the business may require.
The Utility was built in Wilmington in 1841,
and draws when empty but 19 inches water.
She carries BOO Hales ot Cotton and craws men i
but little over three feet.
Country morehnnts who may wish to got their
Goods up in the Summer and early in the Fall
when the River is generally low will find it to
their advantage to patronize this. Several forwarding
Merchants and other residents of Cheraw
and other places are interested, and feel
confident that they can hold out such inducement'
to the back country as will be beneficial
to all concerned. The business will bo done
principally by towing lighters which will insure
a passage while there is two feet water in the
ohunnei.

This to nil whom it may concern?we, the

and owned by the said Kirkpatrick, and
after a full examination of the hull and construction
of the said Steam Boat Ut lity, are of
unanimous opinion that the s.iid Steam Boat
Utility is in every respect suitable and strong
, enough to navigate any River or Rivey>, and
capable of carrying five hundred or more bales
of cotton.

the commodities which pass through their
hands.
