MR. BUCHANAN AXD .MR. CAJ.IIOUN. 1
Some one or two Democratic papers in the J
South-West, which seem to prefer .Mr. Buchnn- \
;j an, have spoken unkindly of .Mr. Calhoun, with 1
a manifest disposition lodio up old and buried
prejudices. We regret lo see this, not mora for
the sake of .Mr. Calhoun, than of Mr. Buchanan j
himself; but still more for the sake of their and ;
our common principles, liian e:tlicr. For Mr.
Buchanan we entertain ^'rcat respect .and rojrard
in common with the friends of Mr. Calhoun ' en- i
1 I
erally, so far .is we nave ncara weir khhiuuk.,
expressed. His admirable speeches, elevated,
statesman.like coarse, anJ apparent devotion to
principle, have made a deep impress ion in Ids
favor in this region, and we should deeply regret
to see unkind feelings produced between hen and
Mr. Calhoun, or their friends, by {lie indiscreet
remarks or prejudices of some one or two of the :
latter. That we ourselves, shot)!:! prefer Mr. |
Calhoun?or that his friends .generally should'
prefer him?need not be surprising to any one.'
This preference may be felt, and even "urged,;
without disparagement to any one c!.- o: .mil, considering
the deeply affectionate regard entertained
for him by his iriends, especially in this State,
it has been a source of pride and pleasure to us,
to notice with what forbearance and delicacy,
tha^prcference has been held in South Carolina
without detracting, in the slightest degree,
from the utmost courtesy, kindness, and justice,
to all others?without the slightest interference
. with the preferences of others?yea, without a
single newspaper expression of it, so far as we
. have seen: nor would such expression of it he
Eg - now made by us, but to guard those who hold it,
f&V-7- from suffering the indiscreet remarks in ques Vty
tion to affect in the slightest degree, their fce1ings
toward Mr. Buchanan. Surprise has been
again and again expressed to us, by the friends of
Mr. Calhoun in other States, that we, and tiic
nonnle of our State, did not speak out openly
rw~r
and zealously, the (.'reference tlicy knew we ten
for him. Our reply has uniformly been, that this
preference could not lie mistaken, anywhere;
and where was the use oi' speaking out what
every one knew already.'?that our people looked
with deep interest to what others said and
| d d, and were deeply gratified to see the growing
feelings in his favor; but they loved him too deeply
and sincerely to subject hint to the possible
suspicion of influencing them to press him forward,
and estimated him too highly to believe
that his happiness or fame could he enhanced by
his elevation to any office, however high, especially
if it were to be attained through electioneering,
or the importunities o! unme ha'o friends,
rather than the voluntary ; .!! oi ? c-; ncple, sensible
of his great m?v. s, r i that :?c'i elevation
would be no loss beneficial : ?the country, than
honorable to him.
If any one can ho so '-'.ind as to rn's'ake the
feelings of our people toward li.rn, let kmm mark
the numerous sentiments in his favor, (and especially
the tone and character of them,) in all
the published proceedings of the Into celebration.
We believe no people ever entertained a higher
respect and regard for any man, than they do for
him. But there is no mere man-worship in it?
nothing that teaches them to forget, what is duo
to themselves, or to others, to justice, to their
country, or even to their opponents; and, high
aud unlimited as is their confidence m him, ihey
would discard him, as they have done others
whom they regarded but little less, were he, like
_T " them, to betray confidence, and discard their
country?the whole country; but not for his sake,
or that of the country, would they stoop to any
electioneering arts or importunities degrading to
themselves. They wouid not. be mere ofiiceeeekers
themselves, nor sec him. or any o her o!
their public servants, place himself before the 1
country in any such light; nor wouid they, to i
make him President, do injustice to any one of'
his competitors, .Mr. Buchanan, .Mr. Van Huron,
Mr. Benton, or Mr. Clay. If 'hoy erred, it would i
be in too acute a sensiveness of that injustice to
him, which they would scorn to do tootherand ,
from this, we would guard them?at least from
visiting upon Mr. Buchanan, the indiscretions
of his friends. It is hard, even to us, to speak j
calmly and without resentment, of the remarks;
referred to. But that Mr Calhoun will not be;
injured by them, we feci assured; and we should
be sorry that Mr. Buchanan should be?but especially
that the great common cause should be,
to the success of which, thru' the final Candida-1
cy of either, or any other, general harmony and
unanimity are so deeply essential.
As already remarked, wc believe Mr. Buchanan
stands very high in the confidence, respect,1
and regard of our people. We believe this, not i
only from what we have heard of their sentiments '
1~..4 .? /* I.aIIaua l?A ilow'OWOO ?SwLl CSV flli/1
UUl UfL.liiSU v\t" UCIiUVC IJV iv u" .. ... .
th.it any public man who deserves to do so, will
do so. Next to Mr. Calhoun himself, he would
probably be their choice, as well as ours; and
would certainly bo a candidate highly honorable J
to the common cause, and auspicious to its success.
He is a gentleman of h:gh and irreproachable
character, boili in public and private life,
and every way worthy to lead in such a cause.
In this humble tribute to him, we mean no dis- I
parngemeut to others?more than to him, in our
preference of Mr. Calhoun; and will cordially
support anyone now spoken of, who may finally
receive the nomination of the party. \Ve might
say more, but have already said far more than we
designed?desiring as we do to take as lit tic
part in the matter as possible, and defer all discussion
of it to tbe latest possible moment?and
have been betrayed into saying thus much, bv
the desire of shewing how ungenerous, mistaken,
impolitic, and indiscreet, are the assaults referred
to,?how unlikely to advance the interests of
Mr. Buchanan. It is nonsense to talk of the
cause, and its great principles, if we must bs
gin to quarrel thus early about men; or if we are
not prepared to sacrifice all our preferences for
or prejudices against men?Mr. Calhoun, Mr.'
Buchanan, Mr. Van Duron, or Mr. Benton; and i
our individual judgment of who is best calculated j
to advance the common cause?to our far higher
and nobler devotion to the cause itself. Let us
but make that cause the object, and men the
means only, and our success?our most triumphant
and glorious success!?is beyond all reason-:
able doubt. But reverse lliom?make 7nert the
object, and the cause the means?and our defeat,
our disgraceful and most humiliating defeat, will;

TIIE LUCAS FAMILY. n<
A SHOCKING HISTOUY. lli
A gentleman of veracity and respectability in j L
Montgomery county, connnunicates tlie follow-1 cc

oft lie most wicked and abandoned that ever c:

Ciirisliansburg, July 4,1812. o
Gentlemen: myself, as well as many others a!
i (no doubt) feel some interest (in consequence of F
! our knowledge of the man and the facts) in the a
notice in your last paper, headed "The l'cuilen- g
: tiary." I ailuded to Lucas, llis family and their Ji
crimes are well known to us all. Tliey are no- ri
toriously worthy to be grouped with the Harpers, li
j the Murrels, or any others desperadoes that have i
| flourished lor the last century. You say in jd
j your notice of Lucas that his case is a strong, n
j argument that crime runs in the blood, llow , w
i far this rule will carry out, taking, the human j is
; family en masse is not for me to say; but how far ' o
: it lias been illustrated in this family of Lucas, j t;
stands conspicuous in our criminal record, and I c
! marked with blood. I will give you an epitome ! tj
j of this family and their crimes, which, if inade fi
: out by a competent historian, would make a i 'I

! amill error you make in your statement, you lo- a
cate the Lucases in Grayson county; that county j c
is spared the disgraced'nurturing such inonsters. s
The scene of their lives and depredations is in p
t he county of Giles, on Doe Greek, a small -I
I branch of Mew Iliver, which heads in the cole- g
hraleii Salt l'ond Mountain, and from its ohscu- n
riiy and loneliness, and the character of its in- h
habitants, has always been avoided by civilized ti
man. But to the tale:? j I
The father of the Lucases is now about 93 i w
ye.irs of age, and is no doubt a hoary headed vil- I
imi, although he lias during his long life been h
adroit euojjfii to commit no crimes of which tJie ti
law couid lake cognizance, I will give you one t!
trait in the vharaacter of this old sinner, which '<
will suliice to sliow what kind of a man lie is.? ri
On the recenttrial of his son "Dave" when Ins 'I
life was in jeopardy, this old man 011 being asked t<
wiiat was the character of his son David, res- j tl
ponded that he believed "Dace would l;ill any L
man Jar twenty fire cents."
The lirst in this family of blood, perhaps tin- p
paralleled in civil society, was the lirst son of h
"Old Ran" as lie is universally called. (His w
1 name, perhaps is Randolph, but I presume he has
, never seen or heard of the baptismal fount.)? i*
: Well, this first born of "Old Kan," named "Jar- r_
ry" as long ago as the late war, became crimi-! k

TT man, and in one week alter the man's return | h
home, after having encountered all the dangers ; i'
o! war, "Jeriy Lucas," at the earnest solicitation
oi the fiendish woman, pert ended much friend- u
ship for the husband, invited him home with him w
Iroin tlie muster ground, ana tno man was lounn n
i afterwards murJered behind a log, with about j In
JOU weight ot' stone upon his body. Lucas con- j J'
lessed iliat the evening they Iclt. the muster i ti
ground, lie beat his victim over the head with a ' J{
club until he supposed lie was dead, and went to j j)(
his house and staid all night with his wife. To ni
make assurance doubly sure, he returned in the tii
morning to see if the man was dead, lie found h,
him silting, leaning against a tree and covered bt
with gore. The poor fellow begged for his liie, hi
told Lucas to lake his wife and he would leave ai
the country as soon as lie was able, and would th
never say anything about what he had done to cc
nun. Tlie savage Lucas was inexorable, mur- R
dered him out right, and concealed liim as I have re
stated. For this murder he was apprehended,
tried, convicted and hung at Giles Court House, j of
in the fall oi the year lil4. "Old Ran," his fa- tr
tlicr, sat under the gallows when lie was hang- j tvi
ing, and amused himself by eating gingerbread, j w
The woman or wife of the murdered man, es-: ut
capcd punishment for want of testimony to con- J he
vict her. <r(
Next in the list of this family of criminals is vt
"Dave," or David the second son of "Oid Ran," I he
and the lion of the family, if exceeding all the I ty
rest in the number and magnitude of his crimes i <n;
will make a villain a lion. "Dave" commenced I
his career of crime about twenty years ago, when I ?.(
he was nineteen years of age, bv stealing a horse, | Kn
fur which he was convicted and sent to the penitenliary
for live years?during which time, lie t a
and another convict contrived to make their es- C|]
cape Dave came on home, was captured taken m(
back, and served out his term. ?.
But not long after his return home from this, .0
his lirst probation, the incorrigible Dave contriv- *_
cd to rob a small dealing pedlar of nearly all his
stock in trade, for which crime lie was again ^
sent to the penitentiary for three years. Im
At the time of this last conviction, a cousin of su
Dave's, a lad sixteen or seventeen years of age,
was convicted of some crime, and also sent to the
penitentiary for three years; of comsc they were s:ii
discharged at the same time, and left, the penitoutiary
together. The boy has never been "r<
heard of since; and Lucas, in someofiiis drunken
frolics, has boasted that as they came on ;l(
home, he killed the boy, and threw his body into SV!
the river; and he told the "boy's father, that when
lie ran his knife into him lie bawled like a calf.?
If Dave tells the truth in this matter, he must t'rc
have murJered the poor bov for the wretched i>r
pittance that was given him when he left the ins
penitentiary, to defray his expenses on his way sic
home. On the night Dave came home from the in
penitentiary the last time, a large stack-yard, as ui<
also a valuable barn, full of grain, were burnt in ari
Lucas' immediate neighborhood, belonging to I tin
persons who were witnesses on behalf oi the! tin
Commonwealth, in his several convictions.? | it i
From cogent circumstances, and t lie character of bo
Lucas, he was universally believed to bo the in- ' tei
condnry, and since his last conviction, he has se<
admitted the fact. Lucas' next exploit in the I ho
way of crime, was at a muster in September j ho
last. He had a quarrel and fight with his own of
sister's son, and in the fight he struck a blow dri
with bis list, which instantly killed bis nephew, j lai
For tIds murder be was arraigned, tried and ac-isi

up and concealed in the hollow of his hand
en he struck the blow that killed his nephew.
The next crime of which Lucas is accused, is
!y founded on strong circumstances, which are b
>se:?Some years ago, a man who had been v
with a drove of cattle to the north, merely as s
driver, was returning home through Lucas t
ighborhood on foot. Jle was seen to pass a 1
use in the morning and almost immediately af- i
, Lucas was seen by the same man who saw 1
/ .villi tiis rifln rrnn (
c driver, to go on auer imu, " * -
his shoulder, and directly after the same man '
iard the report of a gun down the road, the way '
cy had gone. Lucas soon afier returned and <
ere was seen a large quantity of blood in the 1
ad. But as the driver was an entire stranger, 1
) investigation was had. lie never arrived at
s home, nor has he since been heard of, and
ucas, if guilty of this murder, if a murder was
nnmitted, escaped punishment. Very recently,

loutli.
Lucas' last crime, and for the perpetrat ion of
liicli the world has been freed from such a moner,
was the murder-in'-John Pot]', a poor laborer,
ho had licen working at the saltworks on Kanivha
a few months, and who,* with the proceeds
f his labor in a wallet, was travelling on foot and
lone to his family and home in the county of
'loyd. Lucas fell in with him on the highway,
lid as it was late in the evening, enticed him to
o home with him, as he said lie could entertain
im Ibr the night, as wed as any one. In an evil
lomont poor Poll'consented, and soon after met
is fate.
Dave' killed him within less than two hunred
yards of his cabin, and so obscure is Lucas'
isidence, that the murdered man lay nearly a
eek above ground without discovery; and what
: certainly a very strange infatuation on the part
f the murderer, apparently, no pains or care was
ikon to conceal the foul deed. This wretched
riniiiif)! was anurehnnded. tried, and found guil
^ol'tliis murder liy the jury in fifteen minutes
om tlioir retirement from the court room.?
"here were seventeen witnesses on behalf of the
/'uiiimonwcaltli: tlie criminal had no witness,
nd refused to employ counsel. The court, of
ourso, assigned liiiu counsel, but his case was
o plain and flagrant that the learned counsel (I
resume) thought it unnecessary to make any
efonce, and submitted it to the jury without aruuieiit.
Sentence of death was therefore proounccd
upon him, and in accordance, he was
ung on Friday, the 24th of June, at (xiles C. If.,
io day you saw his brother in the Penitentiary,
'lie spectators, male and female, black and
liite, would number perhaps 50(10.
The wretched man died as he had lived, reckiss,
and without any outward sign of compuncoa?made
no particular confession when under
be gallows: on the contrary, made use of prome
language when in this awful situation, in
espouse to something said to him by sonic ot
be attending r.'ergy, and finally made an attempt
a bite the sheriffs car whilst lie was adjusting
lie rope round his necki So lived, and thus died
lavid Lucas, the wretdftbd murderer.*
The Hon. Judge brown's address to Lucas on
assing his sentence, has been published in the
lichmoiid Whig. If you have not seen it, it is
ell worthy of reading.
The next in the list of this family of criminals
i John Lucas, thowne you saw in the Peniumtialie
is old ltin's, third son. He, also, ha-<
illed his man, and his full cousin, too; for it
penis tbey arc like olfl Cain, their hands appear

diaviour on hearing of Dave's final fate, and

ive hcen to the credit of the family if Dave had
;cn hung many years ago.' John was tried for
s life, hut as the murder occurred in a fight,
id under very aggravating circumstances on
ic part of the murdered man, John's life was
nnproinised for a 11 years residence in the
enitentiary. I never heard of any other dep.
'dation:; on society committed by this criminal,
ou have seen him; he is a very good ftc simile
Litis depraved family of Lucas. They, are.
illy, a savage looking race. There are yet
to brothers younger than llio.se already named,
ho have not rendered themselves so conspic
jus 111 liic annals ot crime: wnat their rates will
; time only can toll. They promise fair to be ;
jnuine chips of the oid block, and although ,
.ung, arc already the terror of the neighbored.
Vou can hardly believe such a coinmuiiiof
savages could be produced in one family, in
ir civilized country. '
Old Ran' has also daughters, for these ill
ceds are very proline; but they are worse than
ns, (save the mark) and thereby hangs a tale,
it it is a tale not meet to be told among chrisms,
and I will pass over it. I have written
lough to weary your patience, and perhaps
onopolize too much of your time to read it ?

WASHINGTON; JULY 25. 1
I learn that the administration and many of
ioth parties are well pleased with the Treaty o
i'ith Gre.it Britain. The Treaty embraces and n
ettles numerous points in controversy: and ti
nany very important concessions are made to us. r
!f the settlement of the North Eastern Bounda- s
y lias been liberal towards Great Britain, she a
ias, in other things, been liberal to us; and con- t
seded to us points of more difficulty, and of
ivhich wc were much more tenacious. Taking
die Treaty as a whole, it is a triumph for this
administration; and, for that reason, it will be a
denounced and even defeated by the opponents a
of this administration. It is unfortunate, but
unavoidable, that these great questions should i
become mixed up with the Presidential question.
- V.I
The House, to-day, disposed of the amend- (
ments of the Senate to the Army bill by reject- ]
ing them all in the Committee and in the House \
too, by majorities of two to one. By this decis- \
ion, the Army is placed in some jeopardy. It s
will be reduced and discouraged, if the House <
prevail; and, if the Senate prove constant, as |
generally they do, to their decisions, it will fol ?
low that the Army will have no appropriations
made for it this year. (
The Navy Appropriation bill is in the same
situation. The Senate propose a conference up- ]
on the disagreeing votes. i
Mr. Adams spoke, to-day, in favor of redo- i
ring the Army, and said it was unnecessary to i
keep up such a force, because there was no danger
of any foreign or Indian wars. But he
was, he said, in favor of reducing the Army because
there was no prospect of keeping up any
revenues. He passed them to the orders of the
President for collecting duties after the JJOth of
June, and declared that (hey were unsupported
by any law. He said the edict of the President
was as the levy of shiptnoney by Charles 1st,
and intimated that it would be punished by the
people in the same way. He next attacked,
with great bitterness, the Attorney General for j
h's opinion in favor of the circular to the Col-I
lectors, pronouncing that the Attorney General;
was no lawyer.
The House had not a chance for a flare up on :
the Maine Boundary question.
Mr. Holmes replied to Mr. Adams and vindicated
Mr. Legarc from his animadversions.?
The debate lasted till one o'clock, when the bill
was reported under the previous question.
Towards evening, Mr. Arnold-got up his
resolution to reduce the pay and mileage of
members of Congress. The motion to lay it on
the table was lost. But the House, nevertheless,
evaded the question.
Tim SJonfito ivna phipflv pnnrarrprl on the Reve

expose of the subject, in an able manner.
Mr. Archer spoke in favor of the bill and Mr.
Berrien in opposition to some parts of it.
The opj)onent.s of the measure will move to
strike out the distribution clause, and, if that
motion fail, they will let the bill go.
WASHINGTON, JULY 27.
The house, today, was exclusively occupied with
the bill introduced by Mr. Arnold, of Tennessee, to ^
reduce the pay of members of Congress to six dol- j
lars a day and their mileage in proportion. The j
sumo bill also reduces the compensation of all offi- j
ccrs ofilio government twenty per cent. Amotion
to reject the bill was lost, 55 to 107. Mr. Arnold
was anxious to refer it to a Select Committee. But
long debate ensued, in which A
was warmly advocated by those who have but litlle
interest in that emolument. Air Fillmore stated I
that he had no objection to a reduction of the pay, j
but, if the mileage were much reduced, it would not j
be long before the scat of Government would be removed
to the West.
In fact, the mileage has long been looked upon I
here as necessary to the very existence of the Union. I
Wboii it shall cease to he the interest of the rncin- J
bers from the great and predominating West, to come
hither to the outskirts of the Union as the scat of the I
central government, they will proposo and carry a j
1U1IIUVUI* <
Various arguments were urged for and against a
reduction of tlie per diem of members. It was said
that distress pervaded tlio country; that llio Treasury
was empty; that Congress was reducing other ex. ^
penses; and that, therefore, it was proper that their
own p iy should be reduced. \
At length the previous question was ordered and |
the bill was passed to a third reading?yeas 89, I
navs 79.
Mr. Marshall then rose, and in an animated and 1
truly excellent speech, gave his reasons for voting
against the bill. In the course of his remarks, he t
stated that he should never come to Congress again. J
The House finally adjourned, amidst cries in favor
af passing the bill and clamors against it.
In the Senate, the Revenue Tariff bill was taken 1
up, and Mr. Woodbury made an elaborate and able '
lrgumcnt against the bill. He opposed it chiefly for f
lie reason I hat it was exclusively protcctivo in its ]
character, and that it w .s intended to yield twenty
(even millions, whereas only twenty would bo neces- n
iary, after the restoration of the land revenue to the h
Sovcrnmcnt. 8

LATER FROM ENGLAND.
The Acadia left Liverpool on the 5th inst.,
.nd arrived at Boston on Thursday morning at
ibout 1 o clock. y_ > * " *
The news brought by the Acadia possesses
ather more interest than usual.
The former accounts of the great .distress anongthe
manufacturing and laboring classes is
jonfirmed, and resolutions have been offered in
Parliament that that body ought not to adjourn
vithout inquiring into the cause of the distress,
rs extent and the best mode of relief. A proposition
lias been made for empowering the Crown
luring the recess of Parliament, to open the
aorta to a free importation of-6b*rn should the necessities
of the people demand it.
The markets remained without any important
changes in cotton, sugar, teas, or coffee.
The convict Francis, wlfo fired at the Queen,
lias been reprieved, and ordered to be trai sported;
and another similar attempt has bepn made
upon her Majesty's life, by a young man named
Oxnard.
The Queen is in delicate health.
Mr. Everett, our Minister to St. James, attended
the annual dinner of the members of the British
Association, at Manchester. Lord Francis
Egerton, after some complimentary remarks,

which Mr. Everett made a replfif which was of
course, happy and eloquent
A discovery has been made" lately, in the
northern part of Australia, of a new river. The
inhabitants were stated to be neither numerous
nor troublesome.
France.?The Paris papers are devoted almost
exclusively to the elections.
Telegraphic despatches continue to communicate
success in the provinces adjoining Algiers.
The last is dated June^Efeh.
A royal ordinancechafr^begn published, imposing
an ad valorem du^.%29 per cent on all
linen yarn imported mto^the kingdom. This
measure lias produced 'great stir with English

Government will submit to an amelioration. 3$
The judgment which has recently excited so ;
much interest in the mercantile world, on ac
couui oi uie r rencn post onice, wnicn attempted
to suppress the forwarding of expresses by couriers
011 horseback, and for which the courier of
the Morning Herald was a short time since condemned
by the court of Boulogne to pay a fine or
150 francs and cost9, has been reversed by the
court of St. Omer, to which superior court an appeal
was-,-made. The latter court has acquitted
the courier, Vivien, without costs. p
India and China-?The Indian Mail arrived
at Marseilles on the 29th of June. The following
telegraphic despatch reached London on
Friday:
Gen. Pollock had joined Sir R. Sale at Jellala- jy-j*
bad, re-establishing on his march the authority oEpfv
Thomas Khan Sullpoora. He was to march, oni^, "
Cabul as soon as he was joined by Col. BoultorGen.
England had reunited his troops, forced
the passes, and joined Gen. Nott at Catidahar.
Capt. McKenzie, had arrived at JallafrAjd,^vfth^
-afforpfiwm Akhax, Kli.m to prifeonentfj&i. '
911 conditions. The answer was not knownA~fS&
Gen. Elphinstone died 23d of April.
India itself remained in the most profou't^
tranquility
The destruction of the garrison tif Churznae -*'
is confirmed. Col. Palmer left the ci'alekwjfe
2Gth of March, and took up his quarters in'a portion
of l he town. There, as in the case of Cabul,
the Ghoznees, apparently without orders,
attacked the troops, and a frightful slaughter ensued.
The leader of the insurgents, Shumshoodeen,
interfered, and took the officers under his
protection, and they are described as now living
as prisoners in the citadel. .About one hundred
only of the Sepoys are suppessd to have escaped.
The accounts from China are interesting- 1 in
"'b' "*
the 18th of March, the Chinese, 10,000 strong,
iried lolietake Ningpo, while another force attacked
Chinghre. Jn both instances they were
repulsed, \vith considerable loss
The Chinese were allowed to enter Ningpo,
without opposition, but upon reaching the market
place were attacked on all sides by the British
roops, and instantly routed. When they got
within one hundred yards of the British guns a
errific fire of grape and cannister was poured
lown upon thein. They fled in confusion,deavng
about 250 dead. The 49th regimeht -was
hen sent in pursuit, but up to the last accounts
lad not returned.
A simultaneous attack was made upon Chingur.
The enemy were again routed. The Britsh
did not suffer a single casualty at either
dace.
This appears to have been only part of a conerted
attack, as at tbe same time fireboats were
aunched against the ships.
The mandarins also contemplated an attempt
ipon Chusan, for which purpose they had colected
a considerable force on the island of Taiam.
Their intentions were, however, frustratd,
by the Nemesis having been sent to reconloitre,
and ascertain the extent of their nrenara
i?r?~
ion?, A boat having been despatched from this
easel, itwas fired on by theChlnese; When puling
into a creek. The steamer's erew were im- icdiately
landed. They succeeded, after killig
many of the enemy, in capturing 30 junks, ^
upposed to liave been intended to convey troops
) Chusan.
By a notification from the plenipotentiary, it
ppears that the Chinese will be suffered to use
leir own discretion in fortifying the banks of * *
lor-ex between Wharopoa and Canton; but
jat if they venture to erect new works below
le former place, hostilities will be immediately 2
;sumed.
The state of trade in Canton had improved, . ;
lany sales having been effected during the latter
irt of the mouth of March. Opium was sold at
jry low rates. v
