^ us abide by it, If we wish it al'ered, the
mode is indicated on its own pages. That
instrument was designed to protect each
and all of the States in their peculiar rights.
If wo wish to trespass upon those rights, J
we can have the Constitution altered accordingly
; or dispense with it altogether.
There are precedents enough to guide us in
such a career. Look, for instance, at
Central America?Mexico?or the Argontine
Republic. Look at any two commu"
nities at war with each o l?er: There is
tho opposi e of the principle which our
Constitution enjoins, in full operation.?
Would our glorious Republic he bpnt fitted

COCHRANE BOM8 CANNON.
\%T a S. nril 1 Q
IT A3UI11U1U11) [MUKUIM ) ilj'lll tv> I
The rumors of war have set some of;
our people utjouf considering whether we
are at all prepared for such an explosion.
What is the result? All our funs prove to
be almost entirely unsupuihrd with ordnance.
We have plenty of forts, but precious little
in them. Hence, some of the various improvers
of fire onus, who have been danc
ing attendance upon the Government for
a long time to no purpos?, have been
brought out by thctoscin, and are offering
their plans, it is passing s'range, but very
true, that even the best of these meets with
opposition among the official personages
who ought to he foremost in giving en- i
couragement to every improvement bear. :
ing marks of any thing like promise. I
allude to Cochran's new Patent Bomb
Cannon. If a number of members ofCon.
gress had not seen its meriis arid taken it 1
up vigorously and fearlessly, this great 1
invention might never been heard of.? ;
There is every likelihood, now, of its i
getting into general use and superseding all 1
other ?finance. It lias been tried twice 1
here, in the presence of large assemblies.
The last trial was on Saturday, April 11,
at the Arsena!% But before I describe the
triumphs of this last experiment, at which I
myself was prison', I will s ty :i word about
the powers to which the new invention
makes claim.
First, then, it can firo sixteen shot in the
time required for two of an ordinary can
noil; some say more, it can oe managed
by six men; for the minagonvrit of an
ordinary cannon, eleven uro required, so
that eaeh one sav >s the rations ol five men.
It has no recoil, hence docs not require to
- lie kept in its place by breeching. It is
charged without either swab or ramrod.-The
rapid firing does not heat if. O.diniry
cannon must be cooled wiil? vinegar and
wafer after thirty discharges ; but Cochran's
has been found perfectly cool after
one bundled shots in rapid succession. It
has thrice the durability of ordinary cannon.
All guns first fail at :ho breech,
where the charge first ignites and the ball
starts; but as Cochran's is conslrucn d with
n three chambered revolving breech, of
course it mus; be of thrice the durability oi
those now in use.
It has been observed by some of the t
members of Congress who have witnessed
experiments, that a single stealer with
two sixty-four pounders cons:ruc:ed on
Cochran's plan, might destroy any line of
battle ship. None of the latter carry
heavier metal than the forty-two pounder,
and while these were under the act of being
loaded, an unbroken s'ream of fire would
be pouring in upon the line of battle ship
like re. iterated thunder bolts so that nothing
could save her from sinking. Thesteamer,
too, being smaller in s:ze, would be less cx
posed, although so much larger in power.
Tho advantages from increased celerity
would equally uttend the use of Cachrnn's
gun in fortresses. " For a garrison gun,"
says a letter of General Waddy Thompson,
. Chairman of the Military Committee,?
44 there cannot be a doubt about it." 44 I regard
it as beyond measure," observes he in
another place,44 the greatest improvement in
the way of fire arms that I have seen.
On Saturday last.lhe uttendtincc at the
Arsenal was very numerous. A great number
of Senators and Representa'ives appeared.
The experiments were thoroughlysuc
cessfui. The first thirty two discharges
were made within four minutes. In the next
experiment, seventeen discharges were
made in two minutes and twenty seconds.
In the third, there were eight within the
minute. In the fourth, there were three in a
third of a minute.
Quackery.?One canno' peruse the advertisements?which
daily uvet his eyes,
recommending an infinite variety of nosu ,
rums as certain cures for all the disease that
full to the lot of man, without feeling thai
1 .? e
common sense is uncmr par in mis age o!
humbug. Quack doctors, qu ick lawyers,
quack philosophers, and quack American
, cii'zens, are intolerable nuisances; but quack
patriots are still more disgusting.
iV. 0. Bulletin.
The trade between England and Texas
appears to be growing. Five ships were
expected to leave the ports of London and
Liverpoot during the ensuing summer for
Galveston. The exchange of the rafa material
of the one for the manufacturers of
the other, will no doubt be mutually profitable,
and lead to an extensive traffic.

^ Suffering on the Frontiers.?One of
the prisoners among the Cumanches, Mrs.
Webster, who escaped and came in o San
Antonio a few days after the terrible slaughter
was twelve days, after leaving the Indians,
wandering about before she reached a
point of safely. She carried her child the
whole time, and gleaned her subsistence
from the fruit of the prickly pear, which abounds
in these regions. Several times she
saw maraudiog bands of the enemy, but
contrived to elude them. Ibid.
A letter from Garey's Ferry, (E. F.)
published in the Army and Navy Chronicle,
states that various and repeated trials ha
been mado in pursniug the Indians by t
bloodhounds, all of which have proved in(
fectual. On one occasion the dogs we
laid, on, but would not follow up, the trail
two warriors w hose rifles, pouches, &c. h;
been captured half an hour previous, tl
Indians being so hotly pressed as to comp
them to relinquish their much valued wen
ons. A second instance.4 when two Indiai
were slrot near the h?ad of \hapoka Lak
the dogs could not be induced to take t!
slightest notice. These and others, addt
to the trials made at Garey's Ferry, in a
tempting to lollow Indian Billy, and evt
the negro guide, are evidences sufficient
themselves to put an end to all reliance upc
them for the service expected from them.
Military.?lust as our paper was read
for the press, we learned that Brigadit
General Taylor had been relieved, at h
own request, from the command of tl
troops in Florida, and that Brigadier Gener;
\V. K. Arrnisteud, of the 3d Artiller
had been ordered to succeed him. Tl

The letter from Win. M. Price, dat"d

Vanderpool and Mr. Curtis, Represent
lives in Congress from New York, r
quests the aid of those gentlemen in proc
ring the appo utment of a committee, wl
shall Oe empowered, uuririg ine ensuir
recess of Congress, 10 interrogate, mo
specially, all persons, and examine all of
ces, books, and papers, in any wise co
nected with the collection of the rcvent
ve in the -southern district of New York, from
he the 14th of April, 1834, to the present
?f. time. This request Mr. Price supports oy
re saying that whilst the expense attending
of such an inquiry would he inconsiderable,
id the result might be of great public interest;
ie adding, with much significance, that "I' 's
r-1 exceedingly important to ascertain all the
p. parties implicated in the frauds committed
ns in thn: district, ns well for the detec ion of
e, those who may hitherto have escaped suspi
cion, as for the vindication of any one
-d falsely accused of par icipation n tin* wrong
done in that depHriment." The intimation
n of this sentence is quite plain, that persons
in really implicated in the stupendous defalcn>n
lion at New York have h?t her to "escaped
suspicion," but may be deiected by the appointment
of anoth' r cotnmittee of Con'y
gress to investigate the matter. We do
not see why this very rcasinmle request
,s of an accused person may not r>e agreed to.
