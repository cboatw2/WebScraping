And all went merry as a marriage bell."
Byron.
Was it a dream of rapture given?
With such creations as iniglit well
Wing from the radiant halls of Heaven,
To bind with its resistless spell
The soul of song, and bid gush
Fresh from its unsealed fountains forth,
7
Lending 6uch hues as only flush
Its wavelets in an hour of mirth,?
That floated from its spheres on high,
Wakening tones of minstrelsy,
And twining o'er the sleeper's bro\y,?
To win from darkened scenes of earth,
Ilis spirit by the hallowed glow,
Such dreams alone can light below,?
Wreaths bathed in dews of heavenly birth?
No, not a dream! though all too bright,
Too beautiful, too exquisite,
To float, save in those realms above,
Where Peris weave their spells of lore;
Aud fragrant wreaths of deathless flowers .
Twine o'er the bliss-awakened hour?, ? ^ *
In radiant glimpses now and then,
By some rapt minstrel's wandering thought;
And sung in such sweet strains again,
That spheres may pause awhile to own
The pathos of oach trembling tone;
And wonder's self stands breathless near,
Each passion-gilt 01 ngni 10 \vc<u.
The liall was lighted?and the wreaths
That hung around, were softly weeping
Such essscnco as the night flower breathes'
O'er truant zephyr's gently sweeping,
When rays arc twined o'er hill and stream,
And spirits leave their flowrcts closing,
To catch awhile the silvery gleain
That bathes caoh petal's hush'd reposing;
And happy groups were moving there,
Whi-e tones as of the burning strings
That Angels sweep in halls of air,
Twining amid their murmuring?,
Such chaplcts as alone might blush,
Iajecpig's undying spirit-gush,
Were breathing round: 'Twas sweet to see
Their graceful forms, half floatingly,
The mazy dance's measure tread;
Vet oh! more softly sweet each smile
The blood-rich checks, all light o'crsprcad,
While eyes, whose glancings richly shed?
Their sunny gleams on all bestowing,?
With rays all eloquence, were glowing,
And bright as spirits wear to wile
Earth's wandering thoughts, when wreaths
are given,
That breathe the essences of Heaven.
Well may such fair, bright forms as those,
That floated half divinely there?
And smiles where love's young spirit glows?
And eyes whose snwiy gleaming wear
All, all of Heavenly light that may
'Round earthly orbs in softness play,
That brightly peered through each bright tress
Of every hue, from softest waves
Of brightest amber's loveliness?
Sucli as within their trilliccd caves,
The Oreadcs deck with the first flowers
That grace young summer's infant hours,?
To the dark depths of waving jet,
. In rich luxuriance loosely flowing,
Or braided 'neath a bandelet
Of pearls, all ra^Jitly glowing:?
Yes, well may tfoeyrattjife, all mirth,
Weave a glad welcome o'er the birth
Of the young Moon of Flowers, that now,
Arrayed in bright gems, laughingly
Looks up with sunny eye and brow,
Like hope upon its brighest sea,
Yet half unconscious of the light
That, bursting o'er her sense and-sight,
Hath waked her being, still- she seems
Lost, dazzled 'mid a sea of dreams,
Not deeming such jjfhpur is her's "*

Correspondence of the Journal of Commerce.
London, March 14, 1842.
The East India Cotton Experimental
Establishment at Surat, in the Presidency
of Bombay, is done up, and the Americans
who are engaged to conduct it are now on
their way home. The Bombay Times of
the22d and 2Sth of January, contains some
curious correspondence on the subject
from Messrs. J. M'Cullough, II. M'Cullough
and Thomas Wolfe, planters from
the United Stales, and the authorities.
From a calm review of all that appears,
and from a careful and minute investigation
of other circumstances, I cannot but
nrriro nt *tir? mil rl iisinn that llifi above
named gentlemen have been treated with
gross incivility and positive harshness.
There arc concurrent facts, and local corroboration,
which warrant an implicit bclicfin
the statement put forth by those
gentlemen; and as both in India, and in
this country, the same has been respectfully
received, mingled with deepregrctat
the result, I shall give you its more important
passage.
"When wc left our homes and came to
this country, under engagements from the
honorable East india Company, wc did so
in the full hope thai success would attend
our exertions, and to that success we were
not only led to look, but bound in our
agreements to calculate on it for our remuneration.
We very naturally thought we
never should have been sent bore to grow
cotton, without having every facility placed
at our disposal which would be necessary
to accomplish the object aimed at.
Wc were not long in Bombay, however,
before we discovered the error in onr conclusions.
We were not to be allowed to
exercise our own judgment on some points
that pertain materially to the success of
our experiment. We wished to see something
of'tlie country, its different soils, and
the agricultural people, before settling
down. The principal collector in Sural, I
and the supcrinlcndant appointed by him,
had these matters in their own hands * *
In resigning we believe that we best consult,
not only our own interest, but that of
the Hon. East India Company: for cramped
as we are, we can do no good."
IMPORTANT FROM FLORIDA.
PROBABLE TERMINATION OF THE WAR.
By the steamer Newborn, Capt. M'Nullatk'a.'wc
ha ve'the1 imporlnut fnfbJigcncc ;
that Haleck Tustcnuggce has come in once
more, in order to have an interview with
Col. Worth. Only a few hours elapsed
after the late buttle in the neighborhood
of the Ocklnwaha. His warriors suffered
severely in that engagement, and he now
proposes to surrender. He has again
gone out to bring his people in, some sixty
or seventy, including at least twenty
warriors. -Col. Worth has given him the
assurance that he shall be made a Chief,
which, together with some other induce
I- ?1 -I liin, Innvnc !lf? miini tO
II1CIUS I1UIU UUI. n/ doubt
that he is sincere. In short, lie lias
been hotly pursued for months past by our
indefatigable troops, and is reduced to extremity.
The surrender of Ilullcck virtually finishes
the war. Sam Jones and the prophet
are still at the South, but they have not
been near the settlements, nor committed
murders for a long time. They pretend
to observe Gen. Macomb's treaty. Halleclc
has sent a messenger to them, and
there is every reason to believe that the
war is at an end. "Wc speak on the authority
of intelligent officers who came in
the Newborn, who had been for years campaigning
it in Florida, when wc slate that
the next arrival will bring lis gratifying
intelligence that the war is concluded.
One of the officers whom we conversed
with was in the lute skirmish with Ilullcck,
which is represented as a sharply contested
affair. Capt. Casey's company, which
I was most warmlv encaged, had been in
hot pursuit ever since the 4lh of March.
Hallcck had disposed his troops perfectly
for the combat, and waited till the attacking
party had extended in light infantry
order and advanced to within fifty yards.
He retreated three different times, in good
order, front hammock to hammock.
Lieut. Arnold, in hunting up a trail, became
seperaled from his command with
only three soldiers, one of which was killed
and the two others wounded. Lieut.
Arnold was thus left alone, and had a regular
combat with one of the warriors with
whom he exchanged shots?the Indian being
badly wounded in the affair.

Efficacy of Bleeding in Curing the disposition
to Commit Suicide.?Whew the
disposition to commit suicide is present,
,I,A t-K/.n!,! La r?o / ifn 1 In nc/?nrlnin tvltnllwtr
ilie patient is not laboring tinder congeslion
of the brain, or a determination of
blood to the head. The loss of a small
quantity of blood has frequently been?
known to remove the propensity to self-destruction.
A case is referred lo by Schlegcl,
of a woman who was liable to periodical
fits of suicidal mania whenever she
allowed redundancy of blood to accumulate
in the system. On two occasions she
attempted suicide.?On the first indication
of a return of her delirium she was generally
bled. Relief was instantaneously af.
B
forded. A gentleman, who had received
during the Peninsular campaign a sabre
cut in the head, felt fur some years, whenever
he was exposed to great mental excitement,
or indulged in the use of spirits,
a suicidal delirium. Twice he was detected
in the net of suicide. The local nb-.
slraction of blood from the neighborhood
of the brain was the only remedy which
appeared to subdue the disposition. The
case to which I have already referred, of
individuals who were insane at the momcnt
when the act of self-destruction was
attempted, but who recovered the use of
their reasoning after having inflicted a
wound attended with loss of blood, fullv

A Soi.niEit's Lass.?The Fort^Fick'ciing
Eagle tells a very neat little story of a
young lady in those diggings. It is to this
effect. While donations were being made
in relief of the Tcxian volunteers, a young
lady, prompted probably by a feeling of
patriotism, natural on such occassions,
took from her neck a strinjr of coral beads,
which she'presented to tlie auctioneer,
then at his vocation, in order that it might
be sold?it being the only article of value
at Iter disposal at that time. It was sold
and returned to the auctioneer by the various
purchasers to be resold, we understand,
at least a dozen times. The last purchaser
returned it to the fair doner, but she rejected
it, saying she had'prescntrd it to the
company, and did not desire that it might
he returned. 'Keep it, then," replied the
purchaser, "as a memorial of what it has
done, and wear it in memory of your departed
friends."?Dollar Weclhj.
"Brif.f Authority"?The way in which
some starvelings demean themselves while
enjoying a little authority is enough to make
a human being blush. The Indcpendant
Democrat tells of a mechanic at the Spring
field armory, who one day last week was
informed that a messenger was near with
a letter, for him, brought by Ilarndcn's express.
Immediately he applied to one of
the major's "minute men" for permission
to receive it, either in the armory or at
the door. But the haughty-underling' rc-frtficdto
grant his request, and advised him [
tifilBr^J',MpUosecthat it might
contain importahi'miormation, (as it was
sent by express,) the mechanic, in violation
of bis instructions, walked out into
the highway and these recived his letter,
which contained intelligence of the death
nfhis mothci in Piltsficld. Jl'hc had obeyed
the tyrant's rule, he would have been
too late to follow his aged mother to the
grave!?lb.
Poverty!?What a true sentence is that
in the beautiful writings of Goldsmith, "if
you are poor, do not seem so, if you would
avoid insult as well as suffering." Any
one who mingles in the daily ranks of life
will find it hourly illustrated. As the
sharks turn and destroy one of their number
when wounded, so is man apt to turn
upon his fellow being when he appears to
he unfortunate and broken down. Instead
1 of raising a kindly hand toraise him up, we
! are apt to push him down. Such is the
1 way of the world. Poverty is said to be
no crime, but men seem to think it akin to
I it.?lb

A NEW MONSTER.

in any respect to a bank?if it be aught
; more than a simple agency for asfely collecting
and disbursing public moneys, like
Van Iiuren's sub-treasury?its enactment
would be a curse to the land. Our republic
wants on institution to regulate the cur <
icncy; that currency is bad enough, heaven
knows?but it is thus bad lromthc very at:
tempts of legislators to better it, and patch
i if. and niece it.
| All chartered financial institutions (fori
j discount and circulation of paper) are ano-'
Imalies in such a government as ours.?k!
I The nation lias bcencurs.ed with them ever j
since the day of its birth?and Willaml
Leggett deserves a statue to his fame for
having started thediscussion of their validity?if
for nothing else. There are innumerable
cliques interested in the continuance
of paper rnoney banks, and innumerable
periodicals depending directly and indirectly
upon bank men and bank friends
for support?consequently those establish*incnls
are not in want of advocates.
When at some future period, the historian
of America shall record the events of
the earlier half of the nineteenth century,
his re&ilers will be filled with amaze. For
that Ijie nionstrotts error of financial policy
and tfie partial ami absurd doctrines upon
the subjjgql.of currency could have obtaincd
a civilised land, will then seem
almost lttcrediblc.

A MOST ROMANTIC STORY.
[Thefollowir.g romantic story, which is- |
said to be strictly true, is translated from :
a Paris paper, generally considered to* he
under the especial patronage of Louis
Philippe, called *&*JAvdiencc."\
At a l eceiitsitting of the OriiniitaLCoiirl ,
ofTambof. a proyrince.of Russia, 263-jP.eas- i
ants were, tried on a charge of pulling to
d?uth^a Russian Aoble, unifer. circnmsta 11ccs
of a shocking but romantic- character, 1
of which the following are the details:? ]
On the evening in question, all was mer-'
rimeril in the cbrTteau of Sokolin-Slaw.
Gaiety and festivity were the order ol the
day. ' Around a table richly and plentiful*
ly supplied with the choicest viands sal
twelve young officers wearing the costume
of the Starobouro regiment. The owner
of the chateau (M. Meerzeloff, aged about
twenty two,) had assembled his comrades 1
to celebrate, in a manner worthy the occa* 1
sion, a piece of good fortune which had i
happened to liim, and to commence with. <
gaiety the enjoyment of an immense patri- 1
mony, of which he had just come in :pos- 1
session. "Another glass of champaigne."
said Mccrzeeloir, taking up the bottle, and |
pouring forth its sparkling contents. i
"To the heahlrof the child of fortune." 1
cried all nroitftd, as they followed his.cx* '
ample in filling their glasses. "In good 1
faith," said one of the guests, "what is
thai?" demanded the nmphylrion. "Tiiey
are not wanting," said the host. "Behold
those young beauties. They shall be to
you as the hour is of this terrestrial paradise."
He pointed us he spoke, and tv. ch'c
young females were seen entering the
chamber, Singing in chorus the favorite
airs of the country. The little of reason
which remained to the host andjils guests
now disappeared entirely. At the dessert
tlio mnle attendants'were dismissed,
and MeerzcelotTV~wtro declared that he was
fH'r iiivwvd^jnako his old comrades hapthe
one ojj h choose '
most to his lasTe;
Accustomed from the craO'e to a blind*"
obedience, and well assured that they
should find neither protection nor defence
among the serfs of Sokolin-Slaw, the poor
girls upon whom the choice of thcoflicers
ffll, quietly submitted to their fate, with
one single exception, namely, that of Maryna,
the most beautiful of them all, who,
taking advantage ol the moment, fled from
the castle and directed her steps towards
the country "What is this?" cried Mccrzceloff,
on hearing the rumor of her flight,
"what savage dare shake off my yoke?
Ivig-Ivan! Alexis! fly in pursuit of Mary.na,
and let her be brought back without delay."
One of the men to whom this order
was given was the brother of Maryna,
and the other her affianced husband. They
obeyed his commands, however, as they
were compelled to do, and went after the
fugitive like dogs in pursuit of- game, and
ten minutes had scarcely elapsed before "
poor Maryna was brought back, pale,
trembling, and bedewed with tears. But
as soon as she was restored to the castle,
Maryna and the other damsels were arrayed
in gorgeous dresses, ami decorated
with a prolusion of gems and flowers, and,
night having arrived, commenced in a sa
loon refulgent with light, one of those
brutal orgies which the Russian nobles,
with their half savage ideas, call a "Supper
of Eden." ? * 2 i
By midnight the sound of music had
ceased in the chateau. Those of the serfs,
whose duties did not keep them at their
posts, had dispersed in the village. Kig
Ivan and Alexis, the brother and lover of
Maryna, had retired to a cabaret, whore
to chase away the thoughts that disturbed
them, they were drinking freely.
During this time, Mafia, the favorite of
MeerzeelofT, was burning witli jealousy.
Ifer master had not allowed her to go
down "to the banquet, lest her beauty
should have attracted the attention of the
officers. She had, however, notwithstanding
tins, been a witness of the ''drama of
love," and -enraged beyond measure at
what she beheld, resolved to be revenged '
upon her faithless lord and lover. She J
accordingly went to the cabaret where
Kig-Ivan and Alexis were (hiking, and re- <
proached them with their want^of spirit,
saying, "Base wretches! yowgtsit. here
drinking while robbed of your sister and r
your wife!' They denied that they were i
the ba?e conniveis at their own dishonor, s
They were rather the-vicliras of their ty- *
rnnica] lord. Mafia continued to taunt r
th'cm until they became greatly incensed, 0
and were on the point-of ill-treating her; i
but she said, "For shame! rather be the I1
avengers of your own wrongs than the g
oou-icMtic i\C n liefhlcsss*woman,*' aijil con- ti
linued to work upon their fecling^until she
at last made them swear that they
would lake no rest until Me'erzceloff had

In about three hours after this, ana just '
before the dawn of day, *Jm1c the occu.

400 peasants, each bearing a truss of
