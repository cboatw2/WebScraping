Merchant of Venice.
The taunts and personalities recenti
levelled at us by the Mercury, were wo
of the revengeful spirit imputed to us b
that print, would render Shylock's huts
of passion. against Iib Christian oppressor
entirely a hefitting caption for our reply
But notwithstanding the inapplicability o
the revengeful portion of Shylock's speect
to our present purpose, and indeed to owt
nature, it itay otherwise suggest nssocia
lions, not inappropriote to theslje-t ant
general tenor of the following retnarks.
The Mercury. of Saturday last, gave
caption to its rude andi uncourteotis remark
on our exceptions to the political, or part3
aspect of Gen. M'Duffie's eulogy on Gen
Hayne, quite in keeping with its perver
sions of our meaning. and misrepresenta
tious of our feelings. We challenge the
adduction of a single word from our edito.
rial, indicative of "the Cotrier's Indigna
tion" against Gen. M'Duffie, or at wat
with the profession that it wras written
"tore ir sorrow than inl anger " So fat
from having vented otn Gen. M'Dulfie "an
ungenerous and unprovoked overflow ol
hile," we expressly acquitted him of any
"exhibition of ill-feeling." or even -1 tn.
kind intention," and ascribed his excep
tionable course entirely to an error of "lhis
taste and judgment." We objected to the
major patrt of tis discottrse "as most oh
n~xiously ou Iof plh.re," it being a disserta
tion on Nullifiation, or rather a warm
vindiention of tha: doctrine; addressed to a
mixed assembly of Union men and Nulli
fiers, by an ettlogist, chosen by a mixed
commiltee of Union men and Nullifiers,
to commemorate the virtues and services
of tite whose premature death, in the midst
of his useful labors and at the height of
his honorable fame, Union men atid Nul
lifiers united to deplore. "The very head
aid frott of our offending bat h this extent,
no more"-and for this honest and tem
perate expression of our wounded feelings,
we have been assailsd by the Mercttry
with vulgar coarseness, and fierce ran'
cour. We have been ever anixious to pre.
serve the dignity of the press, and evett itt
editorial wnrfare tointerchange a knightly
coutrtesy; and to accomplish this end we
have often horte and forlmrne mitch, int
our past controversies with the Mercury.
There are occasions, however, when self
respect commands anti excuses, if it does
not fully justify, the adoption of it diffier
ent and severer tone. Such an occasion
has, in our opinion, ttow arisen. and in re
ply to the unfounded allegation of the
Mercury, that our "attack on Getn.M'Duf
fie has excited the wonder, indignatior
and contmcnpt of every generons mani
whether Union man or Nullifier"-we
say that we feel abundantly satisfied that
our remarks could not possibly have in
spired the contempt ofany hut the contemp
tible. We say this, not on hypothesis, but
on actual and gratifying expiettene-for
generous Uhion men, and generous Nulli
fiers too, have voluntarily tendered us
their free and full approval. And so far
from indulging that tiudying hate towards
our old polittcal adversaries, which the
Mercury woulid impute to us. and which
we fear, firds its prototype in the unex
tinguished fires of the Mercury's owt bo
som,. we are proudt to say that there are
itanty Nullifiers wvhomn we cherish in outr
heart of hearts, and who cherish its with
corresponding devotion; and we addl, in
perfeerincerity,thait we should take shame
to ottrselves were we calpable ofa wish tc
fan into life the embers of our past con
tetntnS.
As a conclusive proo~f of the kind feel
ings, and of the spirit of good will and char
ity, with which we wver: to hear Gen.. M'.
Dullie, we cite the followving editorial fromr
the Cotmier, otn the morning of the proces.
sion andI eulogy:
"The Procession and the Eulgy-O
etttire comnmuntity will utnite this diav~wiuth.
out distimictiotn of party. in doing honor tr
the memory of a patriot and statesmani,
who wvas belovetd and adlmiredl, while liv.
ing, and whose premature death in the
zenith of his usefulness and fame is a cause
of trui versal mourning, antd lamentatioi.
The virtues of the illustrious HVYNa wvill
lie this dlay commemorated, too, by ar
Eulogist, wvhotn South Carolina ranks a
mong the most gifted and true hearted of
lier soits."
We are informed by the Mercurv thal
some Uniion man, whose eairs supped full
of Gen. M'Ilutffie's laudation of Nullicatior
fottnd "not one soord" in it, "calculated te
oifi'end any reasonable man," and wvhc
"was delighted," with the whole perform
anice, and "consideretd the Union met
present complimented, [heaven save the
mark!] by the orator's scrupuilouts avoid,
ance of topics andt expressions, whlich hiad
the least tetndency to offend the most sen.
sitive Union matn." If this he so, wve pita
the Union man in question-he mtust have
forgotten his principles-he mutst havt
beenseduced from his ancient allegiance
by some tiewv party connexions, and all wvi
can say is, "E phraim is joinei to his idol.
let hinm alone." But the Mercury furthe
informs us that this strangely constitute<
or compiletely revolutionized'Union Man
who has voinntarily mrnle common Cn,,S
with that point against us, and who has
i become so obtuse in feeling as to have per
- ceived nothing to offend the Union party
in Gen. M'Duffie's discourse, actually
felt rhe wish that every man of that party
could have heard Gen. 51'Duflie inculcate
the Doctrine, and sound the praises of
r Nullification. Wonderful liberalitv! a
mazing generosity to the one *party--pa:
ternal kindness to the other! And this
Union man, too, we are told, is "a better
judge of delicacy" than we are. We von.
der if this or either of the other contented
Union men rherred to by the Mercury, is
the same gentleman, who was once re
buked by the Mercury for vulgarity, in
declaring at a public meeting that "the
Nullifiers were lice crawling on the backs
of the community.' -
We repeat here, however. that we do
not charge Gen. M'Dunfie with having ut
iered any offensive allusion to the Union
party; all that we charge is, that he abused
the patience, and wounded the feelings of
the Union men pres-ent, by a niisplaced
and ill-timed advocacy of Nullification, to
a far greater extent than was nenessary,
in even a Nullifier, to illustrate the char
acter and services of Gen. Havne, and
that too, with a warmth of expression,
which necessarily implied blame and re
proach on the opponents of that doctrine.
The very delicate and sensitive Union men,
alluded to by the Mercury. heard Gen.
M'Dulfie say, for instance, that Gen. Jack
son's Proclamation (which the Union-party
approved) "preached a crusade" or "was
a crusade against South Carolina," and
this. we presume, he heard with delight.
aud was therefore anxious to have the
whole Union party participate in his ec
sincy. There were other expressions,
more objectionable than that we have cited,
but we forbear. lest we might misquote;
as many parts of Gen. M'Duffie's discourse
fell indistinctly upon our ear. We heard
enough of it how'ever. to be well assured
of our main ground of exception, that ii
was a defencep and vindicatiou of nullifica
tion, elahorated at most. protracted length
-and on this ground we base our opinion
that it was out of place, out of season, and
necessarily offensive to the Union men
who invited the delivery of the Eulogy, or
who assembled to hear it. If Gen. M'
Dufflie had confined himselfto a brief alli
sion to nullification, or even defence of it.
qo rar as it-waq necessarily involved in the
illustration of Gen. Hayne's character and
career, representing the doet rine. however,
as a debateable one, and one on which the
best and wisest men of the Union, both in
past and present times, entertained war
ring opinions, our complaint may then
have been groundless, but against his long
and elaborate dissertation on the doctrine.
and dogmatic assertion of its correctness,
we insist an both the right and propriety
of our exception. When Gen. M'Dufie's
Eulogy, shall he put in print, we will be
able, by citations from it, more fully to
vindicate the course we have pursued
and un'il then, perhaps, we may siffer in
juistice from the hostile or the prejudiced.
We have hut one more topic, which at
present demands extended comment.
The Mercury actnses us of an "ungener
ous stat at Mr. Pinckney." The Mercu
ry vindicating Mr. Pinckney against the
Courier! The Mercury-which but a few
years back, denounced hIim "as a traitor to
the South," and which once opposed him
for Congress, and t wice for the Mayoralty,
with hitter and uncompromising hostilit-y.
When Mr. Pinckney was assailed with a
storm ofohloquy and reproach, by the en
tire nullification press, for his manly and
independent course on the abolition qies
lion in Congress, the Coirier rtood tp fer
him on principle. and did battle for him
and vith him against his foes, and so far
aire we from having made "an uncenerous~
stab t Mr. Pinckney." in our exception
to his course at the public meeting. called,
without distinction of party, to do hoiior
to the tmemory of Gen. Hayne, and ex
press the p~ub'lic andt common grief for his
dleathi, that we are rather entitled to regard
his conduct on that occasion "ant ungener
otis stab" at us. welt authorising us to ex-.
claim "et mu Bruce!" Whtat was Mr.
Pinckney's course in that affatir. As May
or of the City, antd as the oirgan of the
City Council of Charleston, then, as now,
containing a majority of Union men, he
was appointed to present a preamble and
resoluitioins to the mixed meeting, suitable
to the mournful ocasion. The preamble,
w"hich he submitted, without previouis a
doption by the Council, and the speech,
with which he prefaced it, contained sev
eral allusions offensivo to the Union men
present antd the preambleespecially, con
tainied a.positive assertion of nullification,
or State interposition as the right ful rem
edly for alleged oppresbions of the General
Government. We wvere shocked and in
dig~nant at the time, and our feelings met
with a warm response, personally express
ed to us,from many generous nullifiers pres
ent; and indeed, so far as we can learn,
the feeling of disappmohation wvas almost
universal among both Union men and
Nullifiers. Otne Nullifier said to uts, that
had lie been a Union man, he would have
felt it his duty to have risen anti move to
expunge the objectionable passages, and
that when he sawv a distinguished memher
of the Union party rise, he made euire that
he had risen for that purpose, and he was
disappointed to find it otherwise. Anoth
er wvarm Nullifier, one of the most zeal
ous and true hearted friends of Mr. Pinek
ney, told uis afterwards, that he had heard
nutmerons Nullifiers pointedly condemning
the course of Mr. P., and that he had met
Iwith but a single dissentient, and that in
one of the most violent of the party, who
had always becn remarkable for his party
bhterness. Notwithstanding this, the U
Won party, from respect to the sanctity of
the occasion, and the memory of the de
ceased, curbed their indignant leeliugs,and
remained silent spectators of the scene,
most, if not all of them declining to vote
at all when the question was taken. After
the adjournment of the Meeting, the editor
of the Mercury (who is now about to take
up-the gauntlet for Mr. Pinokney against
our engenerour warfare) came up to a par
ty ofgentlemen with whom we were con
versing, and volunteered the statement to
us personally that he was "shocked" (the
very word .he used) at. Mr. Pinekney's
course, and declared that he himself would
interferp-and get the preamble modified
a pledge which he redeemed, we believe,
as far as he could. We, too, interfered
and had a warm interview with o6e of-Mr.
Pinckney's warm friends who had posses
sion of the manuscript, and we urged in all
friendliness to Mr. P., and with a view to
his interests, as well as to satisfy the Uni
on party. the suppression of certain passa
ges as essential to the desired object. Our
suggestions, notwithstanding our most
earnest remonstrances, were only partially
acceded to-the most objectionable passage
was exputiged, but others were retained,
which we deemed highly exceptionable,
and we declared to them that we were not
satisfied, and that the partial modification
of the preamble would not satisfy the U
nion party. We proceed now to cite some
of the most objectionable features which
Hr. Pinckney would not consent to ex
punge, or, at all events, did not expunge.
In his speech as published, he speaks of
Gen. Hayne as being in the van of'the
great army of State Rights and "leading
on thousands to assert the cause of Caro
lina, and the true principles of the Federal
Constitution." [i. e. uullification.] In
the preamble as published, Gen. Hayne's
speech in the debate, on Foote's resolu
tions in the Senate of the Union, is justly
extolled for eloquence and ability, and
Gen. HIayne is represented approvingly as
havitg then,"forthe first time,taken ground
for the South, against the oppressions-of
the Federal Government,on the broad prin
ciple of State sovreignty." (i. e. nullifi
cation.) Again, in alluding to Gen. H.'s
eloquent counter-proclamation to Gen.
Jackson's the preamble, as published
says:
"To this Gen. H. rEisp6ided liy a crtzn
ter-proclanation, in which he ably exhib
ited the wrongs and asserted the rights of
the South and vindicated the principles oJ
the party [i. e. nullification] to which he
was attached."
Now, we insist that these expressions,
unmodified, were improper to be inserted
ini a preamble, presented by one, acting
as the organ of a Union Council, and pre
sented for the acceptince of a mixed as
sembly of Union men and Nullifiers, and
M r.Pinckney's refusalor omission io modi
fy them cancelled all obligution of forbear.
ance towards him. As, however, he had
expunged a porion and the most obnox
tons portion of the preamble, a measure
which we urged for his own sake, not ours,
we did forbear, and would still have for
borne to comment on tle subject, if Gen.
W'Duffie had not, tinder very similar cir
mumstances, given like cause of exception,
although, we candidly.admit, to a less of
lensive extent. We are willing to sacri
lice much for the preservation of peace in
Dur political family, but when our rights
or our feelings are trampled on or invaded,
we will never hesitate to give a fearless
expression of our sentiments. We would
have been content to have said nothing
more about Mr. Pincknev, had not the
Mercury forewarned us that it was about
io employ those cudgels in favor of Mr.
Pinckney, with which it was wont to be
labor him, without mercy and without
compunction.
Wo observe that another print, whoso
editor admits that he did tnt hear the Eu
logy, atid that it has given rise to a serious
division of opinion in the community, puts
forth a homily on the blessings of peace
and concord,and deprecates the rekindling
of the fires of formerastrife. We know not
what may be the intended application of
these remarks: anel we therefore content
ourselves with saying that if any intention
or desire (wvhich we have again and agaitn
disavowed) shall be ascribed to tus, from
any qunarter,to disinter the buried animos
ities of' the past,atnd make them the ground
of renewed party warfare,we are prepared
to brand the imputation with the epithet
it deserves. In conclusion we add that
the Mercury may weall put in a caveat a
gaintst our reference to Gen. M'Duffie's
"One of the People," in which he de
tnouniced and ridiculed state rights con amore
and carried ultra consolidation doctrines
to the vory ultiana thule of extavagance
in wvhich lie dogmatized then as fiercely
against State Rights as lie does noto in fa
vor of nullification. Whenever Gen. M'
Duffie circulates his new political poison,
we shall feel It otir duty to furntish the an
tidote from his own tmedicine chest.
Death of Columbus.-With all the fer
votir of his imagination, its fotidest dreams
fell short of the realit y. He died in igtor
ance of the grand discovery. Until his
last breath, he etntertained the idea that he
had merely opened a new way to the old

magnanimous spirit have been consoled
amidst the affliction of age and the cares
of penury, the neglect of a fickle public;

The PFipeen Gallon Rail Road' Keg.
-We yesterday inspected -at the Rail
Road Depot, i freight car in the-form of a
Mamothhogshead which we were inform
ed 6t the suggestion of Col. Gadden,.
had been constructed and experimented on
by Mr. Tupper ibe President. . Its dim-en
sions where eight feet diametera Athe bilge,
and -twenty one feet long, and on its. first
voyage transported up about fifteen thou-,
sand pounds of. coffee with some light
merchindize in addition and brought doWn.
twenty nine square bales of cotton. The
experiment has been most satisfactory,
and the. hogshead form for cars.-is recom
mended as best calculated to counteract the
resisting pressure of latteral.or opposing
winds; leart exposed to fire; as sheding from.
its rotundity; the sparks as they fall and
thus not requiring tinning-lighter; chda..
er of construction; and admitting'of wheels
of larger diameter without -elevating the
car, than those hitherto used, and most.of
all, least exposed to injury from ihejarriuig
effects of the locomotive and the vibrations
of rapidity of movement.
It is believed, that the hogshead cars
will out last any which have as yet been
in use, an.d will, by all .be esteemed the
most important in diminishing expense
from the cousthnt reparation trnd renewal,
which the. cars of ordinary construction
now reqire.
We understand that the agents on the'
road feel so well assured of the great su
periority of the hogshead form for freight..
cars at least-that Mr. Tupperhas ordered
several of larger dimensions, than,. the
modefone which has been experimntted
on, to be immediately .consiructed, -and'
which will convey from 40 to 45 'bales of
cotton. -
'We likeise soon contemplates barreling
up the passengers on the Rail Road, in a
passage hogshead, the bung of which, to be
ornamented with, a small dome or sky-light.
We claim "The Fifteen Gallon Rail
Rond Keg" as a Carolina invention, and
while we demand no patent, we shall be
stlicient gratified in witnessing all the
other Rail Road Companies adopting the
Hogshead from, as a decided imporve
ment in the construction of fright and pas
senger cars.-Char. Mercury, 14th ult.

WASHINGTON, March 23.
The Senate met but half an hour this
mornin2, before going into executive busi
ness. Mr. Webster's resolution calling
for information as to the operation of the
treasury note system, was adopted. Tb
subject which employs so much of the at
tention of the Senate, in secret session, is
the Seneca Treaty.
Itn the House, it was resolution day.
Mr. Jones represented the urgent necesi.
y of acting on the treasury note bill, and
moved to suspend the rules in order take
it utp; but the motion was lost.
There is as mutch need of the passage
of the appropriation bills as of any other.
MARCH 24.
In the senate, to-day, Mr. Webster, pre
sented a memorial of sundry proprietors
and managers of American Steam Ves
sels on the impolicy and itnjustice of cer
tain enacttments contained in the law re
lating to Steam Boats, asking to be restor
ed to the rights and privileges which be
long to other citizens engaged in naviga
tion. The memnorial was referred to the
same Committee, which has lately repor
ted an additional bill on the subject. The
Steam Boat owners complain still more
of the new bill now proposed thtan of the
existing law. They wish to have all re
strictions, on their business removed.
They ask to be protected from the "pro
Posed aggravations of the relentless doc
trines of the common law, as it now gov
erns the responsibilities of common crimes"
and which, if enacted, will, they say, de
stroy the business. If steam navigation,
they add, be deemed too hazardous for the
public safely, it would be more just to pro
hibit it entirely. They deity that the ex
iting, or the proposed laws furntish ade
quate remedies for disasters. Congress
will, no doubt he willinag to receive any
practical suggestions on the subject, but at
is to be hoped that they will not allow the
Steam Boat companies the "large liberty"
that they demand,
In the House, Mr. Botta consumed the.
morning hour in continuing his argument
on the subject of the admission of the -Jer
sey members. He contended that the
House had admitted these members with
out any examination or proof that they had
been duly elected; they had been admitted
upon the report of a Committee, which re-.
port was itself made wvithout due examina
tion. There was not a man in the Houise,
be averred, who woutld have ,voted that
these members should take their seats,
whether elected by legal or- illegal votes;
but this objet has been~eff'ecled indirectly
through, the report of the Committee.
By a late act of the Legislature of Alabama,
the personal attendance of females as witnesses
at court in civil cases, is dispensed with-their
witten donositionm.- are substituted in all case.
