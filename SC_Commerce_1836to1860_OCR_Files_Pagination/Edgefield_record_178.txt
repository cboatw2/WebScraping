ACCIENsT o 'rui ML ROAD.-We
rtegret to learan that ani accident,.of a seri
o's tat uVt, though fortunately'not affecting
the lives or limbs of persons, occurred out the
.ailBiad on.M onday evening tout. When
the doV. nward train of cai arrived within
a mile of Woodetock, the Locomotive ran
off jle rvad, andcois'equently. drew aller it
the tender, baggage, and. several of .the
freig'-t cary, Alsoa car contatning several
erco horses, belonging to Col. Hampton.
nud others. A number of cars were shut
tered to atoms from the concussion;. and
several of tho horses injured--one or two of.
them, it is reported, so badly as to lead to
the belief that. they will be incapacitated
la'tu any more appeariig on the turf. A
servant was in the car-with the horses, at
the time the accident occurred, but escaped
writlh little or no injury. The horses were
taken from the Rail Road, and arrived
hero yesterday forenoon. The passengers
were brought down betsween d and 4 o'clock
yesterday morning, by a Locomotive that
was despatebted from town to their assis
tauce, as soon ia inTformation of the occur
rence was received. Capt. J. C. Ker the
proprietor of :Woodstock, hastened an ex
press instantly to town, to give notice of the
misfortune, and, with his usual urbanity,
-a- nud-.promptitide, allorded every assistaice
in his power.
It is particularly unfortunate that this cir
cumstance should have taken place at this
period, as we fear it may affect, sonmcw'dt,
the sports of the Turf, during the coming
.week. We hope, however,that none of Col.
. H.'s favorite nags have sustained such dat
age ts to prevent his engaging in the con
test' for the various purses to ho - run for.
Should he not participate in the week's
amusement, the circumstance should be a
source of mtch regret to the sporting coin
muuity.

In the House this morning, Mr. Muhlen
herg's resigtinmion of his sent was announced
by the Speaker. Mr. Wise expressed his
groat personal regret at this annuciation of
the intention of Mr. 1. tMeave the capitol.
1Ie had known that gentleman ever sipee
lie cane into public life, and no-man was
his superior in personal amiability of poli
tical patience. With great humility and
forbearauce lie had borne the burdens of his
party; and while ho regretted that 'ho gentle
ian had escaped the application of his reso
ltion against the appoiutinen c of members
to executive office, he congratulated the
gentleman on being thus removed from the
toil and turmoil of politics here nud in Pein
sylvania, and being sent to a haven of rest,
far abroac!. This speech was followed by
some langhter from every part of the Hall.

In our notice of the Fire in Sunday's
Gazette, we stated that the Mayor in con
sequence of the receiptuf an anonymous let
ter, had " directed a nightly- watch to be
kept at the theatre, which bad been contin
tied to the time of the fire." We hivo
learned to day, that the direction was given
to several city ollicers to watch on a par'tic
ular night specified in the anonymous letter
.as that during which the attempt would be
made to burn the Theatre but on the assu
rance from Mr. Co'oke that four persons of
his.company, would remain every night
in the house, the attendance of the city oil
cers tcas not continued. The fhur persons
contelhplated b'y Mr. Cooke were in the
house when the flames were- discovered, but
not wtiching--two of them with difliculty
efl'coted their oscape.
A *ard.-.Mr. Cooke befs leave public
ly to acknowledge the ardent, though inel
feetual, struggle of the Baltimore Firemen
to preserve some remnant of his lost prop

less inspire a real feeling of gratitude.
It may not he deemed impertinent at
this'overwhelming crisis to state that sever

"I was called upon to.hold an inquest,

The attention of the reader is called to the
Prospectus of "'The W ashington Chronicle"
Wich is'to be found in our columns. It
will .be seen that this Paper is deigned to
supply the place of the Reformer. It is
now in operation, and we have received a
few numbers. Mr. Cralle is known as a
gentleman of very high talent, and of rare
qualifications- as n Editor. It requires
but little reflection to perceive the great
importance of having a Press at thme Seat
of Government devoted to the defence of
Southern interests; and we sincerely trust
that this new enterprize will find many hun
dred friends of the true stamp, in this part
of the country.
CONGIESS.
Nothing of very great importance, we
believe, has transpired in this body since
our last report. Perhaps the most interest
ing and exciting matter is the charge of cor
ruption brought by "the Spy" against a
member of Congress, which was introduced
to the notice of the House by Mr. Wise.
Af:er no little discnssion, and a speech from
Mr. Mathew L. Davis, who is the reputed
"Spy," it was ascertained that the member
implicated is not a member of the [louse,
but of the Sennte, and fur the want of'uris
diction, the whole proceeding here dropped.
WO are somewhat inclined to agree with
Mr. Bouldin. that if time (louse undertakes to
investigate all the charges made against its
character, it wil soon have no character to
investigate.

LITERARr CUIIOSITY,-We have in our {
possession the numbers of the Boston Gaz,
more than a century old. One is dated the
27th July 1734; another 24th September
173t3; and the third the 6tit Septeznber
1725; the lutter being 113 years of age.
The two first are ahout the size of a 10 by
12 pane of glass, and the latter one about
12 by 14. which shows the Gazette to have
been on the deelino from 1725 to 1734.
There are many curious things in these ve
terans of a century, and not among the
least is the style in which they are printed
and their odd phraseology. -We find iin them
also, several advertisments of negroes for
sale, negroes t unaway, &c. which we pub.
lish for the gratilfietion of our roaders.

populatltion as great inl proportion to the whites,
as at is now, without the slightest detritsent frona

us a source of strength, rather than weakness.
