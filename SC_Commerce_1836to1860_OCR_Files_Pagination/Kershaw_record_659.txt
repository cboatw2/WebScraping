Dear Col.?I can ofl'cr this assurance,
that advantages sufficient are disclosed in
the manner of invasion to insure the most
perfect success, if the army arc subordinate
to orders?Triumph cannot elude us
unless disorder prevails in our ranks.
The arrival of emigrants in the country
and their anxiety for active employment
and the want of provisions, will not allow
the lime desirable for complete prepara.

Slates, we can sustain our cause. Texas!
cannot recede. We can no longer remain ;
subject to marauding incursions of the cue-!
my. Our independence must bo recog- j
nised by Mexico. There is a substantial
cause of war, which appears to every manly,
chivalrous and generous heart?it is
the relentless and cruel bondage of our
brothers of Santa Fe, many of whom perilled
their lives on the heights of San Jacinto.
Their liberation is the task of Texas,
and if she is unaided by her friends,
and left to battle alone, she will maintain
the conflict, and never yield until her star
is crimsoned and her last banner shall be
bathed in blood. Your friend,
SAM. HOUSTON.
Extract of a letter from an Executive officer
of Texas.
Barry Gillispie, Esq..
(G eneral Agent of Texas, New-Orleans.) i
Dear Col.?If any volunteers are coming
send them on. The matter must shortly
be brought to an issue. The period to
which delay can be extended for assistance
from the United States is drawingnear.
If we receive none Texas will
march to the conflict like a young giant,
single handed and alone. The bright
beams ol the single star will soon be re.
fleeted from the rushing tide of the Rio
Grande. SVc have erected the bannerol
a glorious destiny, and soon it will resume
its westward way, supported by strong
arms and brave hearts. Let those then
who would participate in the trials as well
as the triumphs of a soldier's life,, come
and come quickly. The field is laid open
to the chivalry and enterprise of our brethren
of other lands as well as our own citizens.
The Mexican tyrant lias taunted,
lias challenged the prowess and power of
the people of the great valley of the Mis
sissippi. Will they not meet Ins cnampi?ns
on the sonny plains of the far South
West? Will Americans linger in view of
he field of strife while Americans fight
or freedom and the extension of moral
md intellectual light? Tell them to come
md share the peril and enjoy the prize,
i"on know the conditions. Let them be in
ill things complied with. Success will
jreatly depend upon proper preparation.
We have just learned officially through
t Texian Agent, that forty-nine emigranis
irrived yesterday in this place from East
Tennessee for Texas. They are headed
>y Cnpt. Coffev, and will leave in a few
lays for their destination. We learn that
hey arc of the immortal Crockett "go
iliead" order, and if so, who can predict
heir success. These emigrants will be
:onvpyed to Texas by the steamer Tom
Saltnond, of Mobile, a fine seu vessel,
vhich has been put in the Texas and Mexi:an
trade by Commodore Moore and the
latriolic citizens of Mobile.
A -Singular Celebration.?Texian

in great style by the Texian prisoners

ibtain leave of the commandant of the
;uard was certainlyingenious, if we were
orreclly informed. One of the Texians
rlio spoke Spanish went to the officer and
old him that it was a great feast day in'
Texas?the anniversary of the patron saint;

vould give the men the liberty of remainng
in doors that afternoon in order to
clcbiate it. To this the commandant
;ave his assent, and the men came in from
heir morning work well supplied with
very species of liquor ami good things to 1
ie cook, shops on
m ir route.
Although unwell at the time and unable
o participate in the festivities, we have
lever seen more joy or hilarity upon any
iccasjon. An excellent dinner was profiled,
speeches, songs and toasts, patriotic
ud humorous, enlivened the scene, the
vails were decorated with Texian Hags,
lone in chalk and charcoal, and a happier
ct of fellows never congregated around a
estive board. A similar scene under
imilar circumstances was perhaps never
jeforc witnessed?celebrating the greatest

sustained, and under his own nose.?

Faitii of the Indians.?Catlin gives
the following account of the belie! of the
Western tribes of Indians in a future stale,
as described by an Indian chief:
"Our people all believe that the sprit
lives in a future state?that it has a great
distance to travel after death towards the
west?that it has to pass a dreadful, deep
and rapid stream, which is hemmed in on
all sides by high and rugged hills?over
the stream, from hill to hill, there is along
and slipery pine log, with the bark peeled
ofl* over which the dead have to pass to
the delightful hunting grounds. On the
other side of the stream, there are six persons
on the good hunting grounds, with
rocks in their hands, which they throw at
them all, when they are on the middle ol
the log. The good walk safely to the
good hunting grounds, where there is one
continual day?where the sky has no clouds
?where there nre continual line and cool
ing breezes?where there is one continual
scene of feasting, dancing, and rejoicing
? where there is no pain or trouble, anil
people never grow old, but forever Jive
and enjoy the youthful pleasure.
The wicked see the stones coming, and
try to dodge, by which they full from the
log, and go down thousands of feet to the
water, which is dashing over the rocks,
and is slinking with dead fish and animak
where they are carried around and broughl
continually back to the same place in
whirlpools?where the trees are all dead
and the waters are full of toads and lizzards,
and snakes?where the lost are always
hungry, and have nothing to eat?arc
always sick, and never die?where the
wicked are continually climbing up b)
thousands on the side of the high rock

months onboard'his vessel, he landed her
on an Island iiilhe South Spas, wholly regardless
of whatwinight befal lier. It hap.
pene3 that theavoman was presented to
the savage monarch of the Island, who be,
came enamored of her. He made her his
wife, placed heronjhe throne, and at his
death left her sole Sovereign ofdiis dominions.
By a European vessel, which recently
touched at the Island, the poor
wood.cutter has received intelligence of
his wife. Shesehthim presents otHsuch
vast value, that he will probably be one of

it shall please her majesty, bis august.

I Judicial Anecdote.?Previous to the
last war, when Judge Chase, a U. S. Senator
from Vermont, was on his way to Conj
gress, he passed the first night of liisjourj
ney at Windsor, Vt. where a man stole his
boots. The thief was apprehended, and
tried, and Judge E proceeded to deliver
the sequence of the court to the fulIlowing
effect:
Ti in Flttmaginj.you are found guilty of
stealing a pair of boots. You stole them
in the fallpf the year, which aggravates
the offence; for had you stolen them in the
heat of the summer, the sufferer could
, have walked'abroad barefooted, without
'serious- inconvenience. But the case is
j worse than this, you stole the boots from
:a great man?from Judge Chase?and not
only from Judge Chase, but from a Senator
in the American Congress, and that,
too, pr^frfdds. to the commencement of an
important session?a momenlous;-vperiod,
when it was expected on every side that
war agarnst'Grcal Britain was to be de
clafed. See, and stand aghast at the results
which might have ensued from your
nefarious act. .The Judge might have been
disposed to 6asf his vote against the war;
his vote plight have been the turning point
of llio matter, By the loss of his bouts he
might have been delayed several days in
obtaining others, and in the mean time,
ihe awful question of war might have been
brought up. In consequence of his absence,
the decision might have been in favor
of war; and thus upon you sir, would
have reunited the whule responsibility of
that horrid event
uu, and you onjj^-ivould have been
"ft%%i??Tesnftmg from ihe" con'flTcf? lor
the blood of thousands spilled on the field
of buttle?for plunderings and burning?for
massacres and carnage?forour wives and
daughters butchered or violated?fur the
tears and agony of widows and orphans!
Yes, sir, all this would ha?c rested upon
you, and in consequence of the heinous,
ncss of your offence, in view of those
dreadful consequences which might have
resulted from your act, the court sentences
you to six months imprisonment in the
common jail."
Judge E delivered this without a
smile, and the man seeing whom lie had to
deal with, answered him in turn:
"May it plase your honor, it's an aisy
sintence to be sliur, for such a dadc as yer
honor says, but I'd be after putirt' it to yer
j honors conscience, if six months bent a
I very unfortunate period to sit me down fur.

gillin work, and then I'll be deprived of
.bouts to mv fate and vittles to my month.
If yer honor noo, would be kind and gentale
enough to sit me down three or nine
months, it would he more considerate in
your honor, entirely."
"Very good, Mr. Prisoner," replied the
Judge still perfectly composed in countenance;
"the court in validity of your plea,
reduces the term to three months. "Take
him away."

"The London Correspondent of the

i "It is not perhaps an important feature
of the (lay, that most of the European governments,
however they may sneer at the
financial position of the United Slates, are
themselves in such embarrassed circumstances,
that (hey eitjier resort to a m >st
oppressive iniquitous*species of taxation
like England and France, or to the more
; indirect and accommodating system of con'trading
large loans like Austria, Holland

jdoors, while this country fines energy and
skill 3L 18s 4d, on every 100L that they

[loans are peculiarly limed, and seemed to
have been directed towards the financial
i pressure here. The British minister, however,
will have no necessity to go into the
market, for his wants?more than his wants
