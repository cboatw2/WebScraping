ON THE CULTIVATION OF SWEET
POTATOES.
Mr. Editor.?In complying with your
request, I give you my practice in the cultivation
of potaoes. It may contain some
errors, hut being derived from experience,
1 am inclined to recommend it.
High, sandy, or yellow soil is the best,
both for roo s and slips. Slips may how.
ever, he planted on moderately low land,
that is well drained. \Vh? n slips are planted
on the latter, they are more watery and
will no' keep so long as when planted on
high lands. On now lands, care should be
taken, if the leaves are not decoyed, that
they should be burnt; but if they are it
'will do well cither for roots or slips.
The best method of preparing land for
sweet potatoes, is by moveable cow-pens.
It saves the time of carting out manuro, and
it also yields a greater return than any other
mode that has ever been prac tised.?
You should commence making your cow
pens just early enough to allow you t.m
to go over your land by the time you are
ready for planting. After you have finish,
cd, yon will find that die land will bicome
hard and compact. Then mark off your
land into lines five feet apart, so ac to have
twenty.one beds to a task or quarter acre.
Nest run two furrows with the daggon
plough down each line, by which the s?il
will become loose and mellow; and now
bed up so as to finish by the la'ter part ol
March, when the seed should be planted
about six inches apart. If you have now
cowpened your land,?compost, cotton
seed, rotted marsh or sedge, and also m.?d:
are excellent manures, if properly applied.
You must cover these manures well, and
give them time to rot in the land before
planting. Cotton seed, if to be applied ?r
proportion of one to two bushels to the bed
and covered early, so that it will have tirm
to vegetate, is good for either slips 01
roots.
Salt mud is best on high land ; it maj
be used on other lands as the maturer o
the roots. Marsh and sedge, if applied it
nroDer Quantities, when rotted, i* nho <*x
I ? 1 ' 1 ?
celleM. Rye, oats, and oiier greert crops
if you plough the stubble in, will net as z
powerful manure, when rotted. As soot
as the potatoes arc up, carefully pick ou
all the grass and weeds on the top of the be<
60 as not to injure the roots of the youn;
plant. As soon as it begins to shoot ou
vines, the grass should be again picked, an
the dirt must bo hauled up to the plants.The
hoe should not be used at this time, fo
it does more harm than good.
There are various kinds of sweet pofa
toes, viz :?Tho yams or Spanish, Icath*
coat, brimstone, with red and white skins
red, with white hearts. The yams or Spanis
potatoes will thrive well on high land wliic
is manure!. They] produce largely, bt
; do not come very early. They are the
1 best potatoes to kerp.
The leather coats much resemble the
vams, and ( ifter from them only in size and
flavor, being larger and more ineal}'. The
brimstone arc an early potato, and will do
well in almost any soil ; but they will not
I do to keep as a provision crop. The red,
with white hearts, are the earliest potato?
j they produce largely on any soil and keep
I well, and as an early crop, are generally
; preferred by I lie negroes. The leather coat
j potato is too most delicate and best flavor;
cd for tab.e use.
i f am not uecuslotiicd to writing for l!?o
j public eye, 3Jr. Edi:or, though 1 have cuj
deavored to comply with your request; and
i 1 hope you will, at all events, understand
! m; meaning.
JOHN'S ISLAND.
Remarks on the above.?Few crops can
he of greater importance to our planters
than that of potatoes?but it is much !o be
' lamented that litis crop seldom receives the
attention it demands. When properly cultivated,
a very few acres c.f this root will
foci a whole plantation for five or six months
tin the year; and that too at so small an't
> expense of lime an 1 labor, in its cultivation,
' as scarcely to be felt,
t Under proper management, the planter
may scldcin fail of producing from eighty ,
, to one hundred bushels of sweet potatoes j
i to the acre ; which amount is as plantation
food, equal to forty or fifty bushels of corn.
. This calculation, our friends of the middle
' districts seem never to have made ; or it
ever they have made it, either a blindness
: to their own interests, or some mismanagement,
lias caused them too little to consider
what is so obviously their interest.
''John's Island" seems to give the pre|
ference to the white heart potatoes with red
j skins, over the "yellow hearts" or brim!
stones?affirming that they keep belter, &c.
i Upon this point, however, we differ from
j him. From most planters we have heard
the decided prcfercnca given to the brimstones
as being a sweeter and more deli,
j cate potato, at the same time being equally
; early, and capable of being preserved
I through the winter.?Edit.

| CLIMATE OF THE UNIfID STATES AND. OP
EUROPE FOR REARING SILK?COMPARED.
j A t a meeting of the citizens of Philadelphia
and unjoining districts, friendly to the
j silk coliurr, held at the hall of the Franklin
| Institution the 29th of December last, the
_r.L_ ?i: .L _
: comparative merits 01 me eiuuait-s ui uie
j United States, and ihose of France and Italy,
. fortiie silk culture, being under considera.
; tion, Dr. Emerson observed, that he re.
garded the climate of the United States as
b< tter adapted to this branch of agriculture
than those of the European countries mentioncd.
In assigning his reasons for this
opinion he remarked, that the mulberry, especially
the moredelicate varieties of thetree,
wi:I resist a very low degree of cold, provi.
ded the atmosphere bo not unduly charged
wi.li dampness; whereas they are very
of en injured, and sometimes destroyed, by
a comparatively moderate degree of cold
i ssociated with great moisture, and giving
rise to an abundant deposition of frost, the
effects of which upon the tender buds and
shoots of plants, is always more or less de.
leterious.
Again, he observed, the health and weL
fare ol the silk worm, and the value of its
produce demand, that whilst feeding, it shall
be freely supplied with dry and Fresh air.?
The food which it devours so voraciously,
is extremely succulent, and iho juices thu9
leceived are thrown out by tho surface of
their bodies in the greatest profusion, so
that during the last six or seven days of
: f cding, the worms discharge more than
th? ir own weight, and this chiefly in the
form of an invisible vapour. Now, if the
air be moist, this exhalation is prevented
fom escaping, for the same reason that a
piece of wet cloth is prevented from drying,
' ?and tho presence of the moisture ob?
; s'ructs the broalhing-pores, situated, like
ihe exhalants, bver the surface of their
i1 bodies. Whatever tends to obstruct the
I j perspiring and breathing functions, must
| subject the animals to disease, and hence
F; the well known fatal effects resulting from
I ' s'agnnntair. In France and Italy, the oc-1
currencc of a very calm and sultry spell
i during the latter stages of feeding, frequent,
t ly causes the destruction in a few hours, of
. | whole apartments full of worms. Nearly
I nil the late European improvements in the
; art of managing silk wo^ms, are mainly dii
rected to increasing the supply of fresh and
' * m /* _ 11
, ! dry ou\ and ttius oDviating delects 01 ciu
?: mate. Now the climate of these United
r! States is naturally far more cky than that ol
) thu western portions of Europe, and the
r i reasons are these; It is well known, that
f! within the tropica! regions, where there ii
i : no inrrference of land, the wind blows in.
. variably from the eastward towards tli
, westward, whilst, without the tropics, botl
i ! north and south, the predominant wind:
i ; blow from the westward towards the east
t J want. In the United States, the westerlj
1 j winds predominating, tend of course t(
5 j sweep the moisture from the land, and thu:
it (render the climate drier than that of wes
d j tern Europe, which receives tiro prevailing
- westerly winds, fraught with moisture fron
irlthe ocean. This conclusion is not to h
! regarded as founded entirely upon theoreti
i- i cal deduction, since it has been establishes
r; by accurate meteorological observation!
; i made on both siJes of the Atlantic. An
;!i 1 one who examines a nnp of those port ion
h J of Europe which have heretofore erijoyc
;t j a monopoly oftlie s?!k colture, will find sue
districts situated at a considerable distance
from the sea board, and generally to the
eastward of mountain ridges. Thus in
^ |
France, the principal silk departments ne
to the eastward of the Cevennos mountains, j
which run from the Pyrennees towards the ;
j upper Alps; whilst in Italy, under the lea ,
of tho lower Alps, the only winds from I
! which they apprehend danger in the feed- I
j ing time, are those which occasionally blow j
j from the south or Mediterranean soa.
It is well known that the Chinese empire j
' r.ossesses natural advantages for the silk j
culture, superior to those of any other ?win-1
i try whero llii.s culture has yet been ex tea- j
sivuiv pursued, and it is in the northern or j
temperate portions of China where the best;
silk districts ore found. A very warm cli.
mate produces an inferior quality of silk.?
Bengal, for example, where, owing perhaps
to the moisture associated with the heat,
the cocoons are so weak and poor as to
require thirty-five or thirty-six pounds to j
yield one pound of silk, of a quality inferior j
to that produced by nny other silk growing ;
country. Some Bengal silk worm eggs j
having been lately brought home to France i
by the frigate Bonite, Mr. Boucher, who I
has long been devoted to the silk trade,!
observed at a meeting of the Paris silk so:
cietv, that if a very superior breed of worms j
! was required, this must not be sought in '
! Bengal, but in countries endowed with a
drier and more temporntc climate, sue!) for
example as that of China, and especially 1
the more northern provinces of that empire,
the silks of which are of a superior quality j
to those of the southern provinces.
Dr. Emerson stated, in conclusion, that |
he thought the natural facts referred to, sup- I
ported by the evidence furnished I>y the ex- j
tremely fine quality of the silk made in va-1
(* /*? 11 /r* '
rious pans 01 our country, oiioraea sumcient
grounds to justify us in claiming for
the climate of tho United States, a superiority
over that of western Europe, for the
silk culture, and to rank our country with j
China, which occupies a geographical posi-'
lion on the eastern portion of the Asiatic !
continent, similar to that of the United States i
in reference to the North American conti-'
nent. |

EXPERIMENT WITII POTATOES !
Mr. Tucker?I planted last spring, j
three acres of potatoes. One half of the
ground was ploughed in the fall of 1837, j
and tho other in the spring of 1838?the
whole a clover pasture in 1837. The part
ploughed in tho spring had sixty large
wagon loads of straw from one barn yard
put on and tuned well under the sod?
I that part ploughed in the fall was well
harrowed and cultivated and then furrowed
shallow, and the seed dropped in drills.and
15 loads of straw and sheep manure, taken
from the sheep sheds, put in the hills over
the potatoes. This piece was decidedly
better than the first mentioned, The
ground was naturally moist, and the execssive
rains of the springs washed and
and drowned the seed very bad, so as to
destroy more thnn a half acre, on part of
which I planted on the 4th of July early
white beans, from which I harvested three
bushels of sound beans. Yet notwithstand
ing the bad season and rains, I harvested
sevenjhundred and fifty-five bushels of potoes,
rhostly pink eyes, the remainder a
flesh colored, (not the Sardinia,) which
I call long-keepers, from their being a
better potatoe for summer's use than the
pinkeye. But the object of this communication
is to give you the result of my
experiment in 183S, on the quantity of seed
required.

No. 7, decidediy the best, and No. 2 had
but few large enough to cook.
I have for seven years assorted my potatoes
at the time of digging, and fed the

spring I again select a "few bushel* of the
largest, and best shaped ones,and planted by
, themselves und saved my seed for the next
I year from the product of those selected,

, above I think will sufficiently account for
5 the good yield and quality of No. 8. I do
. not believe with Solon Robinson, that whole
potatoes are better than cut ones, If any
i person would give me the seed if I would
5 plant whole pink eye, potatoes, I would
not take it, preferring to use a half one of
? my own raising, f have just received an
i order for 40 Dushels of pink eye potatoes

I wish some of your correspondents or
yourself would stir up the farmers (by constant
appeals to them,) to demand of the
legislature some assistance to agriculture
as they will never have nny thing dene for
their assistance encouragement, until
the legislature is made to feel that it is
dangerous (to their offices) to refuse any
longer. Farmers, cannot afford to lobby,
and consequently there is no time i
to attend to their case. Even the
indefatigable chairmnn of the committee
on agriculture last year could hardly sue. ]

MADAME AMERICA VESPUCCI.
This iady, it is well known, presented a !
petition to Congress, asking two things;)
first, to be admitted to the rights of citizen-1
ship iothe Uuitcd States; and,secondly,to ;
be given a "corner of land" out of the pub. j
lie domain of the country which bears the j
name of her ancestor. The committees to
whom her petition was referred, reported
against both applications, but on grounds in
no way personal to the petitioner. The
citizcnsip could not be granted, because. ,
under the Constitution of tho United States, j
Congress can only make general ond uni. j
form rules of naturalization, applicable to all (
persons alike, and not to any one in par-! j
ticular. The "corner of land" could not j
be granted, because there was uo personal (
service from the petitioner, for which it
could be a compensation.
In reporting against her application, the
Committee on the Public Lands did ample
justice to the personal character of Madame
Vespucci, her intellectual and moral qnalities,
her liberal prinoiploe, and her descen't
from tho celebrated Americus Vespuccius;
and recommended her to the American Peo? (
pie for that asylum an J establishment which '
it was not in the power of Congress to
grant. The following are extracts from the
report:
"A descendant of Americus is now here; 1
a young, interesting, dignified^and accom- !
plisbed lady, with a mind of the highest in. 1
telleclual culture, and a heart beating with 1
all our own enthusiasm in the cause of 1
American and of human liberty. She feels
that the name she bears is a prouder title
than any that earthly monarchs can bestow,
and she comes here asking of us a
small corner of American soil where she
may pass the remainder of her days in this
the land of her adoption* She comes here
as an exile, separated fore\er from her
family and friends, a stranger, without a
country and without a home,Expelled from
her native Italy for the avowal and main,
tenance of opinions fuvorable to free insti.

.isliment of her country's freedom. That
she is indeed worthy of the nime of America
; that her heart is indeed imbued with
American principles and a fervent love of'
human liberty, is proved, in her case, hy !
toils, and perils, and sacrifices, worthy of the j
proudest days of antiquity, when the Roman '
and the Spartan matron wore ever ready j
to surrender life itself in their country's ser.
vice.
"The petitioner desires the donation to
her of a small tract of land by Congress.?'
With every feeling of respect and kindness
for the memorialist, a majority of the committee
deem it impossible for this Govern,
ment to make the grant. They think such
a grant without a precedent, and that it
would violate the soirit of those compacts by
i which the public domain was ceded to this
| Government. It is the unanimous and j
| anxious desire of thecommille that the pe? I
; tioner should receive all the benefits and re- I
; cognition that this Government can bestow

the power of the American People. They
feel at least an equal pride and glory with
us in the name of America. Throughout
our wide extended country, among all class,
cs, this feeling is universal ; and in the
humblest cottage the poorest American feels '
lhat this name, the name of his beloved!
country, is a prouder title than any that
adorns the monarch's brow, and lhat, if he
| has no other properly, this name, with all
j its great and gldrious associations with the
I past and hopes for the future, is an all-suffi.

[ Immediate'/ after the report was read ic
the Senate, a national subscription was! "
commenced for the benefit of Madame Ves- s
pucci, to be applied towards procuring her a h
home and support in the United States.? fi
Senators from every quarter of the Union a
subscribed. The amount was received by e1
Mr. Hatglif, tlie Sergeant-at-Arms of the i tfr

hi
a scene mor real life. ; ;l
Visiting the Pawn Broker's shop for the j cii
purpose of redeeming some articles left !>y ' su
an unfortuna'e friend, the following circum-1 cv
stance arrested my attention : ?to
A middle aged man, entered with :< bun- J * ?
do on which he asked a smaii advance, I rjf
and which, on being opened was found to j a'^
contain a shawl, and two or three other &r J'in(
tides of female apparel. The innn was 1
stout and sturdy, as 1 judge from his ap_ j de
pearance, a mechanic, hu'. the mark of ill" dil
destroyer was - n his bloated countenance w<
md his heavy stupid eyes. Intemperance In
lad marked him for his own. The pawn a i
jroker was yet cxaming the offered pledge, tic
when .1 woman, whose pale face and utten- 's
jated form btspokelorig and intimate ac- P1
]uaintance with sorrow, came hastily into
he shop, and with the single exclamation, ^
'Oh Robert" darted rathei thun run, to P'j
:hat part of the counter whether the man ne
was standing. Woids were not wanted to I0'
explain her story; her miserable husband cr
iot satisfied with wasting his own earnings,
md leaving her to starve with her children, K(
lad descended to the means of plundering so
sven her scanty wardrobe, and the pittance, 4<1
P wIiIaK lUin U'Otl IA as
tur uuiaiiuu^ ui iu?o i uuuui j wv/u.%furnish
means, was destined to be squandcred
at the tippling house. A blush of m
shame aroso even upon his degraded face; ^
but it quickly passed away, the brutnl appe- m
titc prevailed, and the better feeling that had Cl
apparently stirred within him for the mo. c?
ment, soon gave way before its diseased jj*
uqd insniiated cravings. "
4 Go home," was his harsh and angry ox- cc
plamation ; What brings you here, running m
after me with your everlasting scolding!?
Go home and mind your own business." P*
"Oh Robert, dear answered the unhappy 30
wife, "don't pawn my shawl." Our cHil- ^
Jren are crying for bread and I have none tl<
ogive them- Oh let me have the money ? Sfl
it is hard to part with that shawl, for it was
my mother's gift; but I will let it go rather
than see my children starve. Give me the n<
money, Robert, aud d .n't leave us to per. ty
ish. n
I watched the faco of the pawn broker,
to see what effect this appeal would have
upon him but I watched in vain. Ho was ^
hardened to distress and no sympathy to C(
throw away, "Twelve shillings on these," ^
he said, tossing them back to the drunkard,! j
with a look of perfect indifference.
"Only twelve shillings !" murmured the i J
heart broken wife, in a tone of despair.?
"Oh Robert don't let them go for twelve
shiiings. Let me try some where else. je
"Nonsense," answered the brute, "[t is
as much as they're worth I suppose. Here, C(
Mr. Crimp, give us the change." v
The money was placed befero him, and
? t i rn? I
the bundle consignee' to u drawer, i no ^
woman reached forth her hand towards the j
silver, but the movement wns anticipated ^
by her husband. "There Mary," he said,
giving her half a dollar, "there, go home p
now and don't make a fuss. I'm going a e,
little way up the street, and perhaps may ^
bring you something from market when I p
come home. j,
The hopeless look of the poor woman, as
she meekly turned to the door told plainly j jj
enough how little she trustad to this ambig. j ^
uous ipromise. They went on their way ;
she to her famishing children, and he to
squander tiie dollar he had retained. ?.

scribed any one class of men which is ex. <
empt from trouble. The most sturdy beg. i

ore sometimes brought to a nunplus. Bel. i
isarius, the champion of the wealthiest emj

After this becoming preface, we may go
fairly to work oil our subject, i heartily
j sympathize with the man who is reduced to j
11 want, without his own fruit ; especially if :
e is a man who earns his bread with (he

IS WIW ART; OR, "THE PENOIL OP W4TUKE.
There has been published an account
om a French paper of a wonderful dis".
jvcry made recently by M. Daguerre?
at of transferring the picture of any
jject to paper, by the action of the sola jht
acting by means ofibe camera obscoi;
which paper, being prepared and
idowed with certain chemical properties
ill retain the impression for an in definite
ngth of time ; and. thus a perfect copy
om Nature may be produced. This diaDvery,
it is obvious, will be of the greatest
dvantage to the arts; and, unless the
^counts which we Jhave received fr<
irotid are grossly exaggerated, it has
lieady been brought to very great perfecon.
