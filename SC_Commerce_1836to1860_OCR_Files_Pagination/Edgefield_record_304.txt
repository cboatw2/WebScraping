tSIS^ENSION OF SPECIE PAY
Mr6iTS.
The Philadelphia Gazette eunuerates
the following among the causes of the late
suspension :
This necessity has its chief cause in the
revulsion of tite opiumtt ti ade wii the
Chinese, a trade ofSay fiity MILLiONS
The instrumnent of this uaue is anuwn to

played as an article of excianige wit tha0
people. Specie, therefore, wst take the
place of it. The Bank of England fairly
areled under these tudhugs frun Uniua
hnd was furced to make a loun-or the Bau
ofF rauce, and the issue of -two .Poukd
notes.
The balance of trade being against us,
demauds caine over i:ere fur specie, and
every packet siJp went out car-yibg awty
from a half to a million of dollars. This
-was the great cause of the late stricture it
-our Banks' discouns; the baiks could not
-discount paper, because tueir issues caut
back upon them directly, forspecie. ie
uerchants were bleeding at evecy pre.
Trade &-coniure were literally stopped
To aid, as tar as possible, the uanks, soei
er them gave their credit to the uaerchanit
Uniler the form of post notes, payable fur
or six or eight mouths ahead, hoping by
the time they arrive itt msaturuty that the
pressure might he relaxed. But ais du
tiot afford the relief. The inerchaints
Mnauufacturers and mechanics were yet sui
hing. This sutiering was not conlined t(
'his city. New-York felt it tndr all i
forms of severity, as indeed did -all out
cities, and the whole count ry.
But besides the foreign demands for spe
cie, the recent tires in New-York, and in
ih-is vicinity. 'have mcle-acahlfor the-rehe
df-the sufferers, under all their lorus, for
A't least one nillionl anid a half ofdollars.
This is all additi on to the previous pres

but the Banks could not miet this additiiona
demand,except at the loss oljust itat Imuel

'The disvairous confusion between al
Areign countries trading with China it
-that region, and the vast detriment to their
interests, are not, we arej)ersuaded, prop
etily uiderstood- The last advices are
that all the opitim in the receiving ships
amounting to between twenty and thirty
iousand chests, have beet. delivered to
the Chinese. A general edict gives liber
ty to all fureigners to leave China, some
of whoi have been ordered to quit the
tbuntry verv soon.
The edict in question commands the
execution of those fireigners who may re
mair and trade in opium, and rh couti -ca
tien of their property. The Aierican
Consul and the majority of the foreign resi
dents, had resolved todepartatonce. How
can such revolutions occur in a couufry so
long and so intiiately conuetted with out
own, without some such momentoas e'
fetts as we have mentiuned;
