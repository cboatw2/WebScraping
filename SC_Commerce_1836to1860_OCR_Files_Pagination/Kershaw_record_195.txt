Charleston, S. C.
Iff offering lo the patro.ingu of the puMic, * new
"literary paper, we arc |ierlr?ctly aware that wo
are*\>ut repeating an oil-tried experiment. The reeulk,
however, we would lain brieve. will bo different.
We are, it ta true, consciou* ol the p^e^ion
of no talent or ability aupcrior to that of our pre leocaxora,
but wc rely, (perhape, indrrd, with too
much of the ardor of ail extxriiMtiitoi) upon the inereaaing
taalc of the aire of literature ; a laate, the
evi.ienoo of which la before us in the number ?l jjc
r tomcats, en^tiged solely ia IU etiuvauon?in me
lyccu.na, the libraries and a;adei?iet devoted to ?cienee
snJ learning. Whilst the North and toe
West are thus assidioosljr eta ployed in the exemplary
task of mental improvessent, we will not suppose
that the South intenJs longer to bear the
weight of that heavy incumbus which heretofore
has whelmed it ia au intellectual slumber more
lasting and profound than that physical ono which
erewliile enwrapped the seven sleepers of tiphesus. i
it is with a hope thus founded, and with an intention
if wo cannot win success, at least to deserve
it; that notwithstanding the uniform failure of those
who have preceded us, we hive ventured 10 claim
the patronage and to labor for the upniause of the |
public. The staka shall be played fir; how the
game is to end, time only can determine.
Our object will be to render the column* of the
Bulletin both useful and amusing. For this purpose,
while ono portion is devoted to original Essays,
Tales and Poem*, furnished from time to time
by our correspondents and collaborators, anoth< r
portion shall be occupied by selected matter culled
from every spot of interest and instruction, in the
vast field of literaluro.
The productions of the press shall pass in review i
... -~.i ?*- 1- 1
?i?y ttuu vii wcij wun wiiidi uicnw our
notice, an impartial criticism shall be bestowed.?
To light literature and to learned science shall alike
l?e ineted their due portion oi censure or of praise,
and it shall not be our faults if our patrons do not
know the intrinsic value of every hook, (at least in
onr own opinion) before they begin to read.
He, says Dr. Franklin, who is good at excuses, is (
seldom good at any thing else; and the same we
opine may be said of promises; lest therefore our
readets come to sora* such conclusion as this, we
will, without further ado, make our bow, and leave
thein in future to judge from our labors whether we
do, or do net, deserve their patronage.

Since the publication ol' lite May number, the demand
for (he Ladies' Companion, I.as been unprecedented
and Iwyond the m ^t sanguine'anticipations.
At the coi: nieneen?er t of ttie voluTne an udilitiouai
number of copies were printed, winch was
considered at the lime aJjquntc to satisfy all Lite
orlcrs xv.iich night !>e received, and leave a considerable

of the seventh number of the volume; a>.d at

daily received from every section of the U. S.
In coosequi-nee ot? this great nnforseeu increes-- of j

number of impressions for tiie subsequent year; ,
i while he mo?t graiolully appreciates ti c unpreoe- ,
1 dented encouragement cxtcnuod to the Ladies' CoinI
pauim, and at th same time, he begs to assure ilie ,
readers of t he magazine aqd the public in general,
i that it is his ardent resolution to meet it with a cori
respondigg liberality on his part to merit its continuance.

as heretofore, continue to be magnificent an I far
superior to those published iu any other magazine in
America. ,
The Ladies'Companion contains a larger quantity j
of reading (han any other magazine issued in this t
country, and its subscription price is only three dol- *
lars a year, while the great combination of talent (
secured for the coming year will render it unequal- (

ITS LITERARY CHARACTER! f
Will undergo considerable change, as the publisher c
of the Lacies' Companion, in order to show his
appreciation oft ho public favor already extended to 1
him so liberally, has scoured the aid of
Mrs. Ann S. Stephens*
lale Editor of tho 'Portland Magazine,'' and author 1
of a series of the most beautiful and popular tales H
ever presented to an American public. No lady 1
possessing greater variety of talent, or better calcu- r
iatcd to aid in conducting a ladies magazine, could
have been selected fiom the galaxy of female genius
which is the glory of our country. In addition to *
the poweiful talents of Mrs. Stephens, the proprietor
has secured a list of contributors, which combined
will render the Ladies' Companion one ol the most
interesting and talented magazines of the day. f

TI1E MUSICAL DEPARTMENT t
Is under the supervision of Mr. J. Watson, whose '
qualifications for the task are too well known to re- (
quire our testimony. 1
This department of the Ladies' Companion, has }
ever commanded a large share of attention, and has i
i i . o.-.i z.iT . . ' -
iiuvu iuvim'h upuu wiiu 110 nine 1 merest ny its roa- {
ders, and more especially the Ladies, whom the
Publisher is in the highest Jcgree anxious to please,
t will continue to be a subject of more than usual
care to him, and to the Professor under whose supervision
it is placed, to make that portion of the
magazine allotted to music, inore than ever doscrving i
of tne countenance of every lover of music. It has t
ever been and will continue to be the desire to have
all pieces of music printed correctly and free from
errors.
THE WORK IN GENERAL. ]
Over every department an equally careful super s
vision will bo strictly exercised by the Editors, and t
all appropriate expenditures will be liberally bestowed
as it is the design ofthc publisher, with the aid of his I
contributors and the advice of his friends to make <
the Ladies' Companion distinguished for the beauty I
and accuracy of its typography?the variety and I
high tone of its literary articles?the quality and
value of its music?and tho unequalled splendor of
its pictorial embelishments. :
It is the deter in-ition of the publisher toMisc eve- I
ry means to maintain the superiority which the La- (
dies' Companion has obtained. For four years he <
has steadily pursued a course ol improvement, and i
he flatters himself that his present facilities are such ]
as to give the Ladies' Companion eminent advantages '
overall other publications of its character.
From the foregoing it will be perceived that tho
Ladies' Companion embraces every department with- \
' in the range of Belles-Lett res and the Fine Arts: t ,
and no exertions or expense will be deemed too great j
to render the work equal to any oilier extant. The
flattering and general testimonials of nearly every |
contcniparary journal in the United States, and in ,
fact, many on -lie other side of the Atlantic, have |
strongly asserted the Undeniable claims ot lhe Ladies'
Companion to the supjort of the public generally.
There is no vork that gives iis read rs such a
great return for their subscript in.
The Prize Articles will all be published during the I
year. These articles will com >riso tiio successful .
candidates for the pre mums of one thousand dollars j
awarded by a committee of literary gentlemen in j
August l ist.

It may also be propelled by iron running gear.

The mere fact of its self-feeding, seems to me to <
>e a very valuable improvement; and besides, the <
quality of the cotton, an it comes out of the proless,
appeared to me to be better and cleaner than
Yoin the common Gins in use, and that it saves <
sonsiderably in labor. Respectfully, &c. t

These favorable impressions of the ailvnntniTi.?

witnessing it in operation. The utility of
Lhe double cylinders and saving of labor, will be
readily perceived and properly appreciated by the .

I have to state, that I have been engaged in putling

have examined the quality of the cotton produced <
by it; 1 consider it equal if not superior to the Car- I

Extra tcclli where desired, for feeders, supplied

it is considered however, will wear out two or three

The Gins ordered will be delivered to the agents,
of planters in any of the sea port towns of the cotton
planting States, at the above prices, the agents
paying the freight on the same from New York,
and becoming responsible for !he amount of the Gin.
It is desirable, when planters give orders for Gins,
they should accompany llictn with their views in
regard to the arrangement of saws, breasts, brushes,
&c. It is found tiiey difler in opinion Some
desire saws of larger diameter than others. The
most common size is 9 or 10 inches ; but some wish
them J2 inches. Some wish 5 or (> rows of brushes
on an axle, while others do not want more than 4
at most. Some wish saws with S or 9 teetli to the
inch, while others want 10 or 11. itli so much
discrepancy, we prefer they should, at the timeol
giving orders, furnish a statement of their withes,
and the manufacturerers can fulfil them in evenparticular.
Where it is loft to our discretion, we
shall ntakethem on the most modern nr.d approved
plan. An order can be executed, from the time it
is received, in the space of eight or nine weeks j
and the Gin in that time placed in the hands of the i
factor To be in time for the next crop, till orders
ought to be in the hands of the manufacture rs by
lite first or middle of May ; except for plantations
where they arc late in commencing to pick or gin
cotton.
