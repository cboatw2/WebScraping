into battle without him?a thing of which*
as we infer from his own letter, lamenting
the effusion of blood, he was very nfueu
surprised to hear. vVhy he took the pains
to revolt against the. MM) government,
and collect an army of ?dp|?? f??h .?'?d
artillery, only In depreciate the effusion
of blood we c'eunot pretend to say.
"He ougbt.fo haye emnaidered that before
he collected an armyj^which he led
aba* ft* ninths in march** and countermarches,
and the? allowed to surrender at
discreUoo, only to show his aversion to
deciding the fate of 'charter* and 'constitution',
by?buyonot and cannon-ball. For
* our past,, wo arc glad to see the liberal
warfare at an enu, as we anticipated, with
so little suffering and loss of humanity.
This comes from leaving the fighting part
of the quarrel to the Portuguese themselves
while Lord Palmerston kept his
marines on board, and British 'intervention'only
looked on at a distance at this
'children's play' of war* from behind its
wooden wlals."
NbwHank in France.?A considerable
sensation has been excited in France,
by the establishment of a Joint stock
Bank, the first in the kingdom properly
so to be called, at the head of which and
the author of the project is the well known
banker and former Minister of State, M.
Lafitte.
The canitnl is fixer! nt fiflv-fivp millions
of francs, wilh power to increase to two
hundred and fifty millions. Lafiite himself
contributes seven and a half millions.
The Bank Lufitte will not issue bank notes
in the strict meaning of the ?erm, ns understood
here of the Bank or of the Bank
of France, but the intention is to issue
bank bills for 25 francs (11) and upwards
payable at Paris or in the departments at
a fixed date, or at one or more day's
sight, which, in fact, will correspond with
the class of paper known here as hank
post bills. The capital of 55.000,000
francs is divided into 10,000 shares of
5,000 francs each, and 5,000 shares of
1,000 francs. Upon the first class shares
the share-holders pay down one-fifth only,
but for the remainder give security for
payment in case of need; the subscribers
for 1,000 franc shares pay the whole down
at once. Thus, although the capital is
nominally 55,000,000 francs, ihc effective
paid-up capital consists, in fact, of no
t mare than 15,000,000 fra ncs, or 000,0001.
I M. JLafitle has published a circular announcing
that the subscriptions for shares
in his new. 44Bank of Commerce and Industry,'*
already exceed the amount required
for its establishment, and calling a
meeting of the stockholders on the 2d of
October.

To my American friends in general:
'Having been called upon, by sevora
gentlemen in this country, to advance
the cause of the Colonization Society, anc
by others of the Anti-slavery Society, 1
I feci it to be my duty, for the satisfaction1
of all partita, U> declare, that whilst I
wish to prompt* the salvation of all man- j

the above named societies, or in any othiff*
which divide the American public in
apolitical view, as it Would be in me, as
a stranger and foreigner, most improper
to ineddld with political questions; and
especially, being now ordained a clergyman
of the Episcopal Church, my simple
duty if to preach the Gospel o: Christ to
aboliifonists and anti-abolitionists, to coIonia
tlionisls and anii-colonlzationists ;
and, in order to induce both parties to
attend to my preaching, the wisest step I
can take, is, not to meddle with those(
points of disoute.

Tho steam boat James Adams, Capt. Cuosc, arrived
at this port last ovoning from Clorksvillo, (Fa.)
Capt. Cliaso informs us that an oxpress arrived at
Clarksvillo on the 3d inst. bringing intelligence that
Sam Jones, the Indian chiof, was on the West sido
of the St. John's Rivor, with 600 warriors, but asserted
that ho would not come in until the lasV moment
Gen. Horn indoz had captured 39 mora Indians?these
are probably the 39 mentioned in the St. Augustino
paper.
It is stated to be i'no intention of Gon. Josup, to '
send the Indian chiefs now at St. Augustino, to
Charleston, and havo them placed in Fort Moultrie
for safe keeping.

that a topsail schooner was about her, as

be the ship Susquehanna, and that the p?
