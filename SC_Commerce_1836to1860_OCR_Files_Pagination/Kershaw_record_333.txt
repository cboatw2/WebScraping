a measure should t.e committed to iho

the donees. He thought ;t committee
ought to be constituted in v.hirh the old
states should have a full; r : rd fain r representation.
We should preserve, whatever
we do the decf rum of legislation, and
not violate the decencies of justice.
Whilst tin. Mr. C would be a'ad Sfp.nv
I #
senator wculdimbrm him whether the adininistration
is in favor of. or against this
measure, or stair:is neutral and uncommitted.
This inquiry lie should not make if
the recent relations between the senator
who introduced this bill and the head of
the administration continued to exist; but
rumors, of which the city, the circles,
and the press arc full, assert that tiio.se,
relations aie entirely changed, and have,
within a few days been subslitu'ed b\ others
of an intimate, friendly and confidential
nature. And shortly after the time
when tins new state of things is alleged to
have taken place, the senator gave notice
of his intention to move to introduce this
bill. Whether ties motion has or has not
any connexion *.ith that adjustment of
formei differences, the public would, he
had no doubt, been glad to know. At all
events, it is important to know in what relation
of support, opposition or neutra'ily,
the administration actually stands relative
to this momentous measure: ho [Mr. Clay]
supposed the senator from South Carolina
or some.ether senator could communicate,
the desired information.
Mr. Calhoun said lie had supposed that
no man had as much occasion lor delicacy
in referring to political compromises as the
senator from Kentucky. The senator had
referred to some transactionin the political
course of Mr. C. which occurred some
twelve or thirteen years ago, and had alluded
to certain passages in which Mr. C.
was accused of changing his political relations.
But that senator knew it was ethers
who had changed their relations to political
subjects and political measures, ra
thcrthan Mr. C. who had followed less in
regard to those subjects and measures than
he was followed. The senator was accustomed
to have his example followed by
others: but Mr. C. had not usually followed.
and especially would he not follow it
now. But Mr. C.'s personal rclalions
must of course follow his political rcla
linns. The senator ha.l now got the whole
true story, and Mr. C. trusted it would ho
satisfactory in regard to the rumor to which
he had alluded.
Mr. C. found it impossible to move with
out giving occasion for accusations of
changing his grounds. If lie was against
| the chief magistrate, he was charged with
I changing his opinions. J flic was in favor
i of him. ho was then accused of changing
I his political relations. ]Jut lie had not
I changed at ail; he now stood where lie
had always stood. and that was on the un|
changeable purpose to bring back the goivermnent
to its original simplicity and e-j
conainy. i le. with others, had succeeded i
! in expunging the whole of the senator's A-1
! ineriean sy tern, and other extravagancies. |
| s<? as to give the government a ciiance of:
taking a fresh start. And it gave J/r. C.'
a ureal pleasure 1o sav that tin; host part
oft lie measures of the present chief magis- j
11rrto were approved by liint and that he
jwas happy of the opportunity of making

As i>> the allusion which the senator
from S >uiit ( Yr iiina had made in iiy.trd
i to Ii:- [Mr. I'lav's] support of liie haul of
another administration (d/r. Atlain;,) it
vir. C\ no pain whatever. It
was an obi .-lory, which !i i.l I since
s'i.'iK ! : oblivion, except wh_n die Senator
and a lev; others tin night proper to bring
it up. ih:i wIiat was the case.' Mr. t'iav
wa? then a member of the House of It presonlal
ives. < : whom three persons h.ad
been returited. from wiioin it was lii duty
of the House to make a .selection for the
Presidency. As to one of those tinvc
! candidates, it was known to be in an unlbrtunale
condition, in which no one sympathised
with him more than did Air. C.?
Certainly the senator from South Carolina
did not. Timt gentleman was tlicrer.

the chief magistracy; and Mr. C. had eoncjuciil!y
lii." only alternative of the i!iu?-tiiats
individual of the Ifurm lage. or of
the man who was now disiiiiguh.hcd in the
lluusc of Representatives, and who held
so many public places with honor i?? himself
and benefit to the country. And if
there was any truth in history, the choice
which he made was precisely the choice
which the senator from South Carolina
had urged upon his friends. The sen at >r
himself had declared his preference of Adams
to Jackson. Mr. (J. made the same
choice; and experience had approved it
from that day to this, and would to eternity.
Histoiy would ratify and approve, ii.1
Let the senator fr>m South Carolina make
any thing out of that part of Mr. (. .'s public
career if he could. JIc defior! him.
i Tiie Senator had alluded to Mr. C. as
the advocate of compromise. Certainly1
he was. This government itself, was*
jlo a great cxieut, founded and rested,
jon compromise. And to the particulari
! compromise to which allusion 1ms been
made, he thought 110 one ought to be more i
grateful than the senator from South Car-;
'oiina. But f?r that compromise, Mr. C.I
was not at all confident that lie would!
have now the honor to meet thai gen I Ionian
face to face in this National capital.
The senator had said that his own position
was that on Stale Rig!its. But what
was the character of this bill? It was a
bill to strip seventeen of the Slates of their
rightful inheritance and sell it for a mess
of pottage; to surrender it for a trifle?a
mere nominal sum. The bill was, in effect,
an attempt to strip and rob seventeen
States ol tins Union of their properly, and
assign it over 1o sonic eight or nine of ilie
States. If this was what the senator called
vindicating the rights of the States, he
prayed < Sod to deliver us from all sue!:
rights and all such advocates.
Mr. Calhoun said the senator from
Kentucky entirely mistook the character
of the hill. It was not only a state rights
measure, but was it indispensable to the
peace and prosperity of the states, as the
only measure that would effect the object
in view.
Having used the word com proa liso.Mr.
C. felt bound to refer 1 he senator to that
particular compromise; and the senator
had said in reply that if any one should iv
thankful to him for that compromise?
[Mr. Clay. Not to we."]
Mr. miutcun. mo senator alwav
claimed lo l>e tlie author of that nvasur ;
and I am net i:: the small-.;.-! degree tisajiUful
to him for It. I knew ho could not
avoid if. 1 was his master on that occasion,
and {breed it upon h!;n. I wrote
Is tine half a dozen letters, saying that the
senator would be obliged to accede to a
compromise, i will now explain that.?
Tint efleet of nullificafn.ii is this; that,
when a si ate interp ws, the majority must
some times yield to the minority. Those
who arc to have the smallest share ol
plunder, in the majority are sure to get
away. In the American system, the constituents
of the gentleman obtained a very
small portion; they were rather those that
were plundered. At the same time when
({en. Jackson occa ioncd the force bill,
tire senator from Kenlnt f v had lost the
manufacturers; Gen. Jackson had supplanted
him, and another senator, not now
present, was also in the way of superseding
him in that interest. The senator
from Kentucky, was therefore flat on his
back, and nothing would answer his own
purpose but the compromise. It was w ith
him cither runvnrnmi.se. nr nrmihil-oi^n T?
war- necessary that either he or the American
system should fail. It was not my
desire to mention these tilings; but the
senator wont out of his way to touch on
kindred subjects, and I there-fore loll myself
compelled to make the c statements.
1 have alluded to my letters on that occasion;
! predicted in them on the third day
of the session that this question would terminate
as it did.
Sir, I will go farther. I yielded a good
deal in 1 hat compromise. It was mv first
proposition that it should go out in IS If);
proceeding in equal proportion for every
year of In per cent. Arid 1 will say farther.
that at the session before\ve nullified
in S. Carolina, i and odiers said that the
question must be settled. It was seven
years which 1 then ftxed on for it.; termination.
and it would have b. en carried in
that time b it for c?>rloe c'f.' -till. ?
In regard t> a!' 1 yielded; my eolleague
[Mr. IVesloji] knows why I did it. but I
d > not chooso t > >ta'e it here. And I
should now have been.silent on the subject
if (lie senator had been s.lent himself. But
he in- no gratitude; and S mth Carolina
owes uim no gratitude. He acted under
the necessity of the ease. I,backed by

3.Ti*. Clay. I am sorry to he obliged to
prolong litis discussion. But I made no
allusion to compromises till it. was done
by the senator himself. I made no reference
to I tic events of til! lie made
it, and I did not in the most distant manner
allude to nullification; and it is extraordinary
that the senaior himself should
ha\e introduced it. especially at a moment
when he is uniting with the authors of the
force hill and of those measures which put
down nullification.
The senator says I was flat on my back
and that he was my master. Sir, i would
not own him as my slave, lie my master!
and I compelled by him! And if it
were impossible to go far enough in one
paragraph, lie refers to certain letters of
itis i/Wii, to prove that I was flat, on my
back! and not only on my back, but another
senator and the President had robbed
me! 1 was Hal on my bacu, and unaole to
do any ihinir I?i?t wdiat l!ic senator from
^onlh Carolina permitted me to do!.
Sir, what was the case? 1 introduced
the compromise in .-pile of the opposition
of the gentleman who is said to ha\e robbed
me of the manufacturers. If met his
uncompromising opposition. That measure
had, on my part, nothing personal in
it. lJul 1 saw die condition of the senator
from South Carolina and his friends. They
had reduced South Carolina, bv that unwise
measure [of nuilifieation,] to a state
of war; and I therefore wished to save the
effusion of human blood, and especially
the blood of our fellow citizens. That
was one motive with mo; and another was
a regard for thai very interest, which the
?rMir>tfii* snv-: T hmiw! in dr>;f vrvt* I trnw
tint this mvat interest had no got in tiic
power of tho chief magistrate, that it was
evident at the next session of Congress the
wiio!u protective system would lie swept
by the board. I therefore desired to giveit
at least, a lease of years, and for that
purpose. I, in concert with others, brought
forward that measure, which was necessary
to save that interest from total aunihilar
tion.
But to display still farther the circum
tances in which the senator is plac'd, h
-ays from that very day of the comprom.s
ill obligations were cancelled that cou!<
ai account of it, rest on him, on Smi!
Carolina and on the South. Sir, wiia
<":ght had he to speak of die whole South
>r even of South Carolina itself! Fori
history is to bo relied upon, if wc ma}
judge of the future from the past, thotinr
will come when the senator cannot pro
jlose to he the organ even of 1 lie chivalrou:
and enlightened people of South Carolina
Sir, I am not one of those looking ou
for what may ensue to themselves. M\
course is nearly run; it is so by the courst
of nature, and so in the progress of political
events. 1 have nothing to ask of the
j senator, of the south nor of South Caroli
jna, nor yet of the country at large. Bu;
11 will go, when I dq go, or when I choos(
to go, into retirement, with the undying
conviction, that fur a quarter of a century
1 have endeavored to serve my country
faithfully and honorably, without a vievi
to my own interest or my own aggrandizement;
and of that delightful conviction anc
consciousness no human being nor all man
kind, can ever deprive him.
Mr. Calhoun. The senator is in the
habit of attacking me, and if I were nol
thus compelled to defend myself, I woulc
pass over the whole matter. I rise now
simply to supply some remarks which had
escaped my memory, and they are a mere
matter of history. 1 was opposed to Mr
i Crawford as a candidate for the Presiden!
cy; and after rnv name was withdrawn, ]
! took no part in the election. I was a canj
didate for the Vice Presidency, and ab
| stained from taking any part, and from al
! electioneering. When the election wa<
decided. I saw the course which Mr. Ad
i air.s was determined to take, and coulc
1 not then hesitate to take my stand in the
I way of resistance.
1 do not know what induced the senatoi
Ifiom Kentucky to get up a discussion o
i i ilis bill at this time. What his motive:
are for all this, he can best tell; but I fee
these personal invectives as extremely un
pleasant, audi would not introduce them
But when they are introduced, it isrequi
si c tiiat 1 should protect myself.
Mr. Clay. One word. Does not the
senator feci that he himself brings his po
l.tical character into debate? I simph
made the inquiry (and 1 put it to senator
to say if such was not the fact) to knov
whether this great measure, which involve
about a thousand millions of the publii
; lands?whether this measure lias the sane
jtion of the administration or not. I di<
it in no way for the purpose of offence
and. by the way, I referred to a rumou
i which is afloat of new relations, publi
and political, with the head of the admin
t rat ion, and stated that I would not hav
made the inquiry but for that fact. And i
it not right, in regard to a great measure t<
i know whether or not, it has the support o
I the administration? lie would at one:
