REPORT ON COTTON..
Made to the Camidge Agn. SMy
The Committee appointed to R* n on
Cotton, beg leave to submit the following:
Considering as they do the importance of
the cultivation of CoUn to be of vast in
pormance to the South, as it is one of those
articles of commerce which always yields
ready cash, its cultivation have been in
creased to an alarming extent, thereby de
preciating its value, although other causes
have bad a tendency in the reduction of
its value. Its too great a cultivation has
been one of the meat obvious causes, by
the supply being so much greater than its
consumption, thereby lessonnig the de
mand; for whenever the supply of any ar
ticle is much greater than the demand or
consumption, as a general consequence it
depreciates in value. Your Committee
are of the opinion, that under any of the
common modes or culture, the supply of
Cotton for our markets is too great. and
would therefore recommend as one of the
means of consuming it, that every planter
should se the domestic Cotton Bagging
now coming into use, (whenever it is prac
ticable for him to obtain it.) and likewise
that the Cotton crops be lessened by each
at least one-third to that-which is general
ly planted. and have no daubs that the nett
proceeds of his crop would yield fully as
large an amount of capitol as it does at
present. The planter would be enabled
to have his crops picked out by Christmas,
instead of not bing able, as is frequently
the case, to gather it until March; more
time would be allowed to manure the soil,
# clear, put up good fencing. and improve
the general appearance or his farm in ad
-vantage. They would be enabled to plant
much larger of Corn and small rain. and
pay more attention to its culture; raise
their own pork, horses, mules, &c., and
live as farqers should do, independent.
We have been, heretofore, too much de
pendant .upon others for supplies which
we might have raised at home, and there
by prevented an enormous eitlux of money
from tbe State. which has been annually
expended in the purchase of bogs, horses,
and mules. .Your Committee believe it to
be the imperative duty and true policy or
every fanner to raisea bountiful supply at
home of every article that he can produce
for home consumption, and some to spare
to his neighbours upon a pinch, and after
wards raise what he can for exportation.
such as Cotton, Wheat. &C., andl having
incidently mentioned Wheat, your Con
mittee woul make one remark, and that
is, that too little attenition has been paid
to this subjecti for ihe purpose of exports.
tion, or for making even a aufficient to sup.
ply the demands of our ow.n State. and
necessarily dependent upon the Norib for
the greater part ofnbe Bour that is consum
ed within the State.
laving made these few preliminary re
marks, your Committee are of the opinion
that the subject of primary importance in
the cultivation of Cotton, is that of the se
lection of Seed. Every farmer who rais
es stock, always makes it a matter of me
ment to select good breeders, they must
be afa certain age, before they are allowed
sb &Mstn besbj !f t
grain or seed is of a good size and sound,
is all they want; but we are of the opinion
that grain or seed may be of good size and
sound. and yet not of sufficient maturity to
produce futll ears, bols, &c., and would.
therefore recommend, instead of planting
the Cotton Seed which has been. picked
out this fall, next spring, that they should
not be planted until the spring following;t
so that the seed which are feeble. and
would necessarily produce, if planted the
following spring. hut weakly plants with
but few bolle-, which seed if left fhr twelve
months, would entirely decay, and you
would have no seed to come up, bus such
as w ould produce healthy, vigoros plat.
. and the balls that are furmed, are apt to
be large and well matured. The seed
should be taken from the second picking
nt, and the Cotton well sunned and per.
fectly dried, on scaffolds suitable foar the
purpose. They are alsto of oPiniota that
seed sh,,uld he ebanged froma one planta
tion to anther every tharee or four years.
The next subject that presents itself for
coansideration, is that of the preparasteon of
the soil, and this will irn a great mensttre
de.pendl upon the nture of the soil you
have to :ul'ivate, for the snanogement of
a stiff clay toil, will require more care and
settention, dlifferent implenaents of agrictul
ture, and taure particular tattention itn mak
ing use of thte proper seasons fur puttmne
it in order, than that of tan open free snudy
soil, and the sooner in the sesntt you c-an
get yottr land inorneder the better. Stubble
land shonld he well broken up early ins the
fall with a twister; lay so dating. yn have
the grass und weeds, which at thig usaso
contains much nutriment turned uder.
anzd which will be decomptosed and it. a iii
state for adding vigor and nutriment tn the
Utton in the sprinsg, besideos having your
land in a loose and easy state for cultiva
tao.
A Ier having broken up your land intend
ed for Cotton well and deep with a scooter,
prepare foar planting by throwing up your
beds as high as practicable with the twister.
and in low wet bottoms pull up with the
lhoe. The beds should he from 30 to 40
inches apart, according to the soil or ma
nuring of the same. If manured old land,
the beds ought to be 3 feet apart ; in low
wet bottoms, always let your rows point
out to your ditch or drain. When ready
for planting, open your bed.. as deep as
you can with a coulter, plant your seed and
cover with a harrow lightly, so as to pull
down your beds as little as possible. Land
intended for Cotton, and to be manured,
should he manured with the products of the
stable, cowpeas, pigpens, poultry yard,
leached ashes, or sueb other compos as you
may have. Lay off your rows, put the
manure In drill and bed upon it. if land
ibat has been planted in Cotton and well
manured the previotus season, be intended
for Cotton the ensuing year, your seed
should he planted upon the old beds, for
the manure is apt to hold out for two suc
cesivejea rs; ifrnot manured we would
prefer planting in the furrow, beease the
stalks will he out of the way, and you wtll
have the advantage of all the litter, bells
and.nsb, that has fallen in the middle of
the (arrow, bteides it being much easier
Withl regard to the time of planting, we
are of opinion, that it should be planted as d

ploughing deep and running as close to
the Cotton as you can without ploughing ti
it up. Then thin out the width of your t
hoe, leaving from two to five stalks to a
bunch. The second sideing should be
with a commen shovel. Ploughing out
the middles pretty deep. and pulling the i
dirt freely up to the Cotton this time with a
the hoe. The last ploughiug, be careful d
not to plogh too dee next the Cotton.
but the midles should be ploughed out a
deep. These plounhings will be sulfictent L
for the making of the crop. a
With regard to late plo-agbing, there is c
a diversity of opinions, but we are of opi
nion, that late ploughing is of advantage,
by destroying the small fibrous or succour
roots. if we may so term them, and also it
the grass, which at this season is apt to o
spring up (especially if the season be a wet
nae.) and sbade the lower bolls cover them
and occasion them torot. as also the amount v
of nourishment it abstracts from the soil c
for its own nutriment, it also leaves the a
crop clean and free from grass, and which
is likewise an advantage in the picking out
of Cotton. With regard to topping Cotton
there is also a diversity of opinions. but
we are of the opinion that nature never .
intended it to be done, but if done at all, it
should be done oarly.
For if it does any good in boiling. (which
is doubtful) you ;ill have the advantage F
Of the bolls arriving at maturity before the 1
arrival of early frost. whereas. on the con- t
trary. allhough you may preveut succaOnr
by late topping. yet the bolls that mny be
formed after topping, cannot arrive at suf
ficient maturity before frost, to he of any s,
benefit. so that you make bolls for the frost (
instead of the gin house, but in early top
ping. if the season suits, you will have the
advantnae of the increase of bolls.
We deem it uunecessary to say any
thing atcout pickiug it out, ginning, sending
it to market, &c.. as e.ery farmer is gui- r
ed in ise particulars by his means and
peculiar circumstances at the time, and
believing that we have said a sufficient on
the sdihject, to be of any practical utility.
without wasting your time and attention I
with mintutin. we.respectfully anhmit the
same. JOHN HOLLAND,

" I am glido , ad that-Mr. Calhoun's
pipularity is.iAery where increasing,
wbatever you miay hear to the contrary,
such I assure you is the fact. In my tra
vels recently through ditierent parts of the
Union, I have been a strict inqirer and a
careful observer, and I have seen and heard
enough to justify me in making lthe asser
tion. I have been in Georgia, upon the
borders of Alabama. in South Carolina.
(where I am at home) in North Carolinu,
in Virgiaia, in Maryland, and here a'
Washington. where great and influential
men are colleeted from all parts of the
Union, and I have studied and ascertained
popular sentiment on'this subject of the
Presidency, and Mr. Calhoun, has, I can
inform you, a more powerful and niore
enlightened party, Composed of men of
weight and inluence. who will support
him in his claims to that high office, than
yon perhaps imagine. If the nomination
of a candidate be postponed to this time
twelve month, till his now more than bud
ding popularity has bad an opportunity to
bloom and dourish, and the convictions
which are now beginning to take rout ev
cry where in the hearts of the people, of
the importance of having just such a man
at the head of aiairs in this time of nation
al despondency, pervade and overshadow
the land, as I think they will. he will. inl
that event be the nominee of the Demo
cratic party in the great National Conven
