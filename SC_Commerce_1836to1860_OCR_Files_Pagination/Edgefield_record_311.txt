Fairflicld Manual Labor School.
T HE faculty, together with the Fx, cutive
Committee, would invite the attention
of the public, to this branch of the Furnan
Instimtion. It is highly grati!ying to them
to be able to state. that the students bale.
the present year, e:tered with spirit, into ti-e
design of diis Institution. in referentce to Mhe
manuallabor systemn: and have mai.ifested a
chteerfel complianire with the requisitions of
their officers, an this part of their duty. Indeed
after close counfinement land mental e.erton
thros -h the day. it often cones as a relief as.
both teachers and pupils. to exchane thei
books for imp!emens of husbanadry aand spend
two hours, in the close of the ]ain. in the ex
ercise of the field. The experiment of t.,e
present year, we think, satisfactorily paoves,
that with proper mantage'tet t and God's bia+
sing, nothitng but p stonage is wanting. t.
give success to the nanal labor system of
education-a system, which we regaril of' ri.
tat interest to the proaperity of otr rountry.
As however, in regatrd to the Izstitution. with
which we are more immaedintely connected.
we neither expert nor desire patronage, wit.i
out corresponding benefit to the patrons, we will
briefly state the advantages to be derived troma
this Institttion.
Habits of Order and Self- Denia.-On the
manual labor plata. it is absolutely necessary
that every thing be condtcted it a very system
atic way. To adjust the exercises of the school
rootm to the hours of work, especitlly, ii,
ploughing time. when the ditferent classe. of
ploughrs. must follow each other in regular
succession, through the day, requires the great
est exactness atd regu'arity. H1ahbis of early
rising too, are nesesarily formaed. The sta
dents are assembled tIor prayer, generally be.
fore the rising oif the sun. anamm iaaediatelf
after the devotions of the mornimg proceed to
the exercises if the school Thus those hah
its of slo:hfulness and self-indulgence. which
are so initriots to tmany or or youth. atnd
which may be indilged. without restrait, :at
those schols. where the pupils are not at all
times, under the teacher's rare, in our lnstitn
tion, where they all board at one place, tender
the immediate supervision elf the Pritcip.d,
may be entirely prevented. Here. too, they
learn to divest themselves of that indolence anud
those false notions of honor, which naturally
arise from a state of slavery: for here. the)
have to vait oan themselves, provide their wood
and water, and keep their rooms clean and it
order. These and such like rteanial tiices.
which perhaps. under other circuanstaaces.
they might have blushed to perform. they learn
to regard as nothinag degrading siace they are
commtnon to sall; and as proot!s on the contrary
of manly independence. since ins', ad of bein,
indebted to others, they obtain by their own e
forts, their comafortt atnd accoommodations.
Now, if tno other good were to result fromn sneh
Institutions, than the formnationa of sauch hablits
and the correc'tion of 'alse tnotons too prieva
lent, one of the greatest objects of' education
would be accomplished-a preparntion for fn-'
tare usefudness in life. The great mtajotnty of
those who are educated, will parofat but little by
thec knowledge they may have acquired but the
habits they form, if'they are good ones, neil be of
use to them" thmough life.
2.feailth and rigor of Consitutin.-It is to)
be lamented that many of thte brightest tarna
menct of society, htave completed their educa
tion with a constttitton so impaired anti feeble
lhat their exalted itntellectutal powers can he of
coparatively little benefit. e'ither taa t'-erm
selves or others. Thte student who is inteansey
engaged, int the acqusitioni of knaowledge. as
not aware, at the timte, that lhe is destroymag
is bodily vigor. whtist he as giving auadue ex
ercise to his oiaad, and that ultimnately, both mut
fal together. Hie discovers when too late, that
he has been violating one of the laws of nature
itt cntitvatinag his mental, at the e.'npence of
his phaysicat powers; anad that ntow at as utterly
impractiable to resttore them btth to their har
monious anad healthftul action. Exercise thean

Others however (and such coanstittute time ma-.
jority of those whot are senat to school) are led
by their active propenasmtes to e.rercise ratl.er
than to study. The'se shotuld hanve their active
propensitiew' controlled anaidirected, in such a
way thant they wiad be' iiimanns neither to

[By RJUa.sT.)
From the Charleston Courier.
To th Men. Iers of the Legislature of S. Carolina
G.NTL:MEN-YOU will shortly he call
el olin :o act on a proposed measure oi
legislation, deeply involving. directly ain
prospectively. the rights of every citizen,
Some men of our community, infatuated
by a blind and undistinguishing spirit o1
huzm;ituiiy, wi.h tmure of zeal than cool
.i-d- inelt,. would ha'n you, ly one "fell
blow." to 'sweep anway the radical ele
meat of liberty in these States, and thal
f6r which Carolina herself has made noble
sacrifices. Will you submit to be made
the agents of inflicting on your fellow citi.
zens, and even on your petitioners and theb
posteritj, a con4titutional wound, whicl1
Northern avarice, with its concentrated
and systematic enprgies, could not perpe.
trate? Your voice was heard, ringing
loud and long. that the Congress of the
United States, derived frost the Constitu
rion no shadow of right to institute any
prohibitory law, except on the imporia
tion af slaves after 1808. And was not
ais the ground on % hich you built youi
opposition to tariff exactions? That is,
that exorbiiant imposts were in their na.
ture & essence pritective. if so, prohibitory,
ani consequently btnconstitutional, Youi
stite docutaeuts embody this as your creed.
You, then, nust believe that Congress
has no power. if it woild. to prohibit the
importiation of any commodity, not even
spirits! This capital article of your poIlli.
cal faith, and that on which our state has
acted Ior the lust ten years, demands yout
nullinching support ; or else you are bound
honestly to discaril it as a heresy. Now,
if* Congress hake not Ihe right of prohibi
Lion, any sensible man nust see that no
state it: the Union can poweag su-h a righi
because the exclusive regulation of com
merce, is lodged in Congress. You,tan.
not thena, as a legisintuare. prohibit or ever
lay a tax prerent the importationt of spirits,
because thec tuax whaich is preventive, and~
not simaply anad singly for reventue puarposes
is iaa its intent atnd essenace prohibitory !
Nsaw to) the advocate of prohibaition I
wouldi say, will you mnake that constitu
sional when done by a State, which you
pronlounce unconstitutioinal when done by
Cougre%s! But you may be ready to say
"the paowers noat granted are reserved tn
thes States, or lo the people." True ! yea
let me tell you that you are not the State,
ntor are you the people! These reserved
rights; are st ill with the people, who, if they
wsuuld, cannlot arant a single power para.
mount to the Federal Constitution ; anad
as the United States have itmposed this
funtdamenatal law on the people of each
Stat e,ao are you bound by the powers con
fidedl to you. You, as legislators, have
tn reserved righats, either by yourselves, ot
froam the people, and are limtitedl by thse
express powers of your 'omnmissiona, till
thonse powers he extenaded r enlargeud,
Yotu cannot, thens, dlepart, one haair's breadth
fromn the Conastitution of this State. Well.
thetn, if is were unconstitutional in Con
gress to over tax commodlities.for prevecn
tive puirposes, it is equally so in a State
Legislatatre, whether that tax has relationa
toa articles imported into, or consuamed in
a State. Over importation a State has ne
power, excep~t on slaves, concurrently,
with an express provisin itn the Feuderal
Cousrtstion. Over the things importeu,
sa Stare can institute, regulation, but not
prohihis ion, either directly. as by ani expresa
law, or insdirectly, by a preventve tax.
if the Constituation of this State warrants
an express law, to prohibit an article o
comomerce, in wahich there is capital anm
labor, I shosuld be glad to be pointed to tha
clause and, atnd. as to a preventive tax
it already, by State documnents, and the
actiona of the state on them, is recognizec
as v'rtumally nothingt more or less that
nenhibition' NoW. if nrobibitinn by Gon
gress, was unjust to the South, though un
der plea of good to the country at large, I
prohibition, by law or tnx, is equally so,
when adopted by a State to het own citi
zens, though covered under a siinilar plea!
But what is unjust? Why that for the
Aoing of which, there is no ridht. Now, I
affirm, there is no constitutional right to I
prohibit the sale and consumption of any I
article of commerce in which thrre is capi
tal and labor either in this, or any other i
State in the Union! And if there be no I
right to prohibit, it is a fla.rant usurpa- i
tion of our privileges, to get rid of consti- i
t'u'tional impedimets by the evasion of a i
tax! This is the very principle against I
which Corolina has been struggling so hard
uind which has. mi its successful overthrow,
covered her with glory. The fact, gen
ilemen, that the object of the law is good,
does not, in my humiie opinion, release I
high minded and philosophical Mtatesmen, 1
jealous of their own and their country's
rights, from constitutional obligations. If 1
you can pr.hibit. or restrict. or prevent the
sale and consumption (of spirits, ylu can I
dictate by latw to every citizen, what be (
shall eat and drink. You ought not, us I
Statesmen to look at the oLect, but the ten- r
dency, prospective issf-. Amid above all, the t
constitutioiality of a meaure; and cer- (
tainly legislators, to promote fair virtue P
herself, must not trample down the sacred a
barriers of right and privilege ! The citi- r
zens may lok calmly on while you pre- s
scribe the game ofhdzard, in which there t
is neither capital nor Ini*r, although they L
may doubt your power: but when you as- J
sail the chantels of commerce under any r
plea, yotu tread on slippery places and f
exceed the limits of your commissiion. I i
will not waste more pains to prove to you,
that you have ie power to prohibit, either
directly or by tax, the importation of ar
(lent spirits, nor to prohibit, prevent or re
strict, either directly or by tax, its sale I
and consumption. without assuming a
power not granted by the Constitution of
the State. You can simply regulate say,
and prescribe the obliations of conduct e
and qjualifications of a retailer of ardent c
spirits; but you cannot restrict the quan- %
tity uithout infringing the rights of a
the poor and making partial lates. You c
cannot prohibit its importation-you can- f
uit prevent their consumption, without (
having yourselves branded as traitors to a
the liberty of the citizen, and felons to the l
Constitutiom. Ardent spirits, if an evil, t
are aggravated like every other, by quan- e
tity, and except you can sweep away the d
whole mass, this quantity will not be les
sened by subdivisions, which make an in- E
viduus distinction between the poor man t
and the rich. Reflect how daneerous it .
is in a republic, to give umbrage to the v
hone and sinew of the State-the peas- ti
atitry; and consider if they abuse their C
privileges, they do no more that has been li
done in every age of the world, and in
every stage of civilization. wlere perfcct c
liberty existed! In republics the laws e
must not interfere too much with the hab- s
ils of the citizen atd when they do, they tI
become odions. are set at definnce, and 11
spurned. When law in republics, stoops
to the field of social indulgence, from that
instant, she plays a game dangerous to
her own digniiy and inimical tocivil lib- a
erty. She must not, by striking at a ree- ti
ognized evil, cut open a highway for some p
futtufe tyrant to march securely to that p
citadel of right, the Constititiuti, which 11
is the sacred barrier of your commission, n
ani of which )ou are not the guardians, a
but the people !
Should you, gentlemen, in your legisla- I
tive capacity, by one single step depart C
from equal rights, the vital element of re- I
publicanism, and thus diverge from the
right line rigidly marked out by the Con
stitution, pray what is the use in the nmass ,
of citizens looking up to that fundamental d
docuament as a check and limit on youar e
commission?-But tmethinks I hear some o
one exclaim, that Massnchgiqetts-the tariff' It
harlot--the tmother of pirohibition--tias ti
piassetd a fifteent gallon law. I have showni ge
that her act was uncoenstitutitnah. and a e
solemn trifling with the rights of her citi
zenis; bitt it' they choose tto be consistent d
in uniformly bpurning constitutional sanc- I1
tions, surely Carolina, the an heroine of -n
stern equality, will shtow herself as sensi- it
tive to her own citizens in their domestic e'
relations s she did ini their federal rein- p'
tions. At any rate it is quite evident that e
the nrotment she occupies the position of -i,
prohibition or preventioni, under any pre- b
teace, she deeerts all her l'ormer principles e
and -brings the weapons shte tdenied to -o
Congress, to bear wi'th aggravated force on i
her own citizens. But will the citizerts a
tamely submit! lAok even at prudish s,
Massachusetts. The mten, who, from good ~
mtotives, lent thetaselves by ptromoting the ai
fifteen gallon law to assail the rights of d
their fellow citizens and infringe the gen- o
era' spirit of liberty, are now astonished .
at their own folly, and struggle to repeal li
the act-all Massachusetts is acitated, and tl
the elections eveni turn ont this point.- e
How thten can yat calcu late on such a e
la w being successful int this state. even if J
there were no constitutional objection.?-- a
But the task proposed to you is one too hi
great for you to accomplish, as I shall
show you ere I have done. Such of you t
as are versed itt history wvill do wveli to re- (
fleet, that the free use of stimuli ha. eter- j
kept pace with the progress of civiliza-. t
tion in states and nations ! There is not j
one solitary example to the contrary.- e
This is a curious fact, and the reasons he- I

It has been susgested that the distant

ieir representatives aidf delegates in Con.

merican Silk Society.
It is desirnble that the varions silk com
anies in the country, immediately up
ppoint their delegates and announce
teir names in the agricultural or silli
opers, and forwardl a copy of the
apers to the Society at Washington, so
tat a correct list or the delegates may be

ublish this or some similar notice of the
