The following extract from the Far.
mer's Magazine, whilst it affords some
useful hints upon the construction of farm
buildings, also exhibits a minuteness of
attention to the economising of labor,
that will surprise some of our readers.?
TAere, it is vorv properly considered, that
the quantity of labor required, regulates
the cost of production, and, consequently
* that labor saved, is money made; not with-I
standing its cheapness, in England, this
golden rule is never forgotten ; and the
farmer is constantly upon the alert, by
the exercise of his ingenuity to lessen his
la!o% and increase his profits:
So. Planter.
?In selecting the site of farm-offices it i
o
is desirable to combine in the greatest
degree which circumstances admit of, the
following objects :?proximity and easy
access to a'public road ; a situation central,
as regards the tillage-land, and so
as to communicate with all parts of it by
the levellest road possible, as the intervention
of a single hill that could he
avoided may make the difference between
two horses in a cart and one. A souther,
ly aspect; as cattle are found to thrive
better and to Inttcn sooner, in folds open
tothesun, than in those from which his
r-ys are excluded. A command of watt
r; so that a supply may be conveyed
through the differant parts of the buildit
gs, and if the grounds afford it in sufficient
quantity, where it can be brought
and collected to work the thrashing ma.
chine,and thence conveyed away, with
little expense and without injury, or, it j
may he, with benefit to the ad oining i
lands; where a sufficient supply of water
cannot he had. the cheapest and best
power is steam,jf coals he within a moderate
distance ; water enough for that
purpose may he collected, if a spring is
not at hand, from the roofs of the offices,
if preserver, in a tank nude in a shady
situation and lined with clay or bricks.
If the economy of labor is to be studied
in fixing the site of farm buildings, it is
not less to Ik1 attended to in their construction
and arrangement; they commonly
form three sides of a square open to the
South ; the highest buildings being on
the North sides, and those of a lower desciption
filling up the East ai d West.

the square, and the barn containing the
thrashing. machine projects into it at
right angles with the line of hovels which
constitute the northern side of the square
the straw being thrown from the rakes
into a large barn or straw.house in the
centre of that range, where it is piled up
for use. It is of convequence that the
barn l>e in the centre of the range, because
the straw to supply the cattle is
carried out right and left, and only to
half the distance which much of it
would require to be carried if the ham j
stood in any other situation; the same I
reason holds with regard to corn which
is being thrashed and intended to be laid
up in granaries : grain keeps much better I
in granaries that are over open hovels, j
than those that are over close houses in
which horses or cattle of any kind are
tied up ; and hy this arrangement the
granaries are made over the hovels, which
extend from each side of the barn, and
the corn is carried to them from the
dressing floor Wow, without being taken
from under the same roof 0r the sacks
are drawn up by a pulley and tackle j
worked from the wheel of the thrashing
machine whether driven by water or
fteam. and conveyed on hand-harrows
with wheels to all parts of the granaries; j
from which again they are loaded into
etrt9 through trap doors in the tloor beIrtv
which the carts are placed within
the hovels. The saving of labor attend- j
inj; the laving up and removing of corn
fron granaries situated, as compared
w.h others at a distance from the thrash
ingbarn, is very obvious, It is desirable j
fron the same reason that the straw barn
shotld stand the cross way of the thrash- j
ingiarn, and not in the same range with
it, k that the rake ot the machine may j
delist the straw into the middle and not
the fid of it; in this way the straw has \
only to he carried half the length of
the base instead of the whole ;and when
twokfodsof straw arc in use, one for fod
derand another for litter, they can be
kept quite distinct, are easily taken out
by leaving an open space between them.
Peculiar situations may very properly
render deviations from these general rules
at times right and necessary, but where
so important a consideration as the economy
of labor is involved, and that for a
long course of years, as in the erection
of an extensive and permanent act of
farm buildings, too much attention cannot
be paid to it in the arrangement to be
adopted.

SUGAR FROM CORN STALKS.
Letter addressed to Dr. J. W. Thomp.
son, President of the New Castle County
(Del.) Agricultural Society:
"Having been requested to furnish
some account of the process for manufacturing
sngar from corn, I cheerfully complv
by giving all the information on the
subject so far as I am at present acquainted
with it. Scarcely one year has passed
since the first idea was suggested in
relation to this peculiar plan for making
sugar; and there has not been sufficient
time for those exact experiments necessary
to satisfy the careful calculator. In
one case 1 obtained from a small piece
of ground, at the rate of 100 pounds of
sugar per acre, but other experiments
made since, have conclusively shown,
that had a different mode of planting
been adopted, the product wnuld have
been increased tenfold. The manner of
raising the corn and making the sugar is
as follows :
The corn is planted in rows 2 1-2 feet
apart, and the stalks are left to stand in
Hm mj; 3 inrhps nnp from another: it is
then cultivated in the usual manner.?
Sometime in August, or as soon as the
stalk shows a disposition to form grain,
the ears must be taken off*; this operation
must be carefully attended to, as upon
'itentirely depends success. After this
there is nothing more to do until the crop
is ready to be taken up, which will gencrally
happen in September ; the stalks
are then cut up at the root, stripped ol
their leaves, and taken to the mill, where ,
the juice is pressed out between iron rollers,
in the same way usually employed i
with the sugar cane. Lime water about i
the consistency of thin cream, is then
mixed with the juice, one spoonful to the
gallon ; it is left to settle one hour, and
then poured into boilers, which are cover- '
ed until the liquid approaches nearly to
the boiling point, when the scum must he
taken oft*. It is then boiled down as rap- ,
idly as possible, taking oftf the scum as it
rises. As the juice approaches the state
of syrup, it is necessary to slacken the
(ire to avoid burning. The boiling is
generally completed when six quarts are
reduced to one : it is then poured into
coo'ers or moulds and set aside to clirvs.
talize. When this process is gone
through, the sugar as to he separated from
the molasses; and the whole operation
is finished. The process here detailed ,
gives the quality of sugar you see in the
samples. If required, it can he afterwards
refined as other sugar. The use ,
of animal charcoal and the employment i
of steam in the process of evaporation, as
is common in the manufacture of beet
sugar, would I am confident, produce
white sugar at one operation.
From what is known on the subject I j1
fully believe that an aero of pood ground
treated as above described, will yield at '
least 1000 pounds of sugar?probably
more. The value of the fodder taken
from the stalks, and of the stalks th?m.
selves after passing through the mill, will ,
be more than equivalent for the whole .
expense oi cultivation and keeping
ground up. The fodder produced in this
way is much superior to that usually made
from its containing a great quantity of <
sacharine matter. And the whole husi*
ness of making sugar from corn contrasts
so favorable with the manufacture from 1
beets, that I cannot but think it will oh.
tain the preference wherever the climate
will bring the former plant to perfection.
Some of the differences may he enumer.
ated as follows : 1st, the com is clean and
agreeable to work with, and the beet is
'1
not. 2d, the machinery for extracting
the juice from the beet is not only more ,
costly, hut is more liable to get out ol re- (
pair. 3d, the beet juice contains a much
greater proportion of foreign and injurious
matter, decomposition commences i
almost immediately after it is pressed out
and if allowed to go on to any extent,
will entirely defeat the making of sugar.
4th, the proportion of saccharine matter '
contained in equal quantities of corn and '
beet juice, is as three to one in favor of
the former?therefore the same difference
will be found in the amount of fuel necessary
in evaporation. 5th, beet sugar, |
when obtained, is inferior in quality and
loses a larger per cent, in refining. Oth,
corn is a native of our cuuntrv, perfectly
suited to the climate, a true American, ,
and is in fact, the finest plant in the
world. The author of "Arator," (Col,
Taylor, of Virginia,) used to call it our
"meal, meat and manure." We now add
sugar to the list of its valuable productions.
Respectfully yours,
WM. WEBB.
Upon this communication Mr. Pedder,
the editor of the Farmer's Cabinet, remarks?
"I am free to confess that 1 have never
seen sugar prepared by first process at all
equal to the samples of corn-stalk sugar
forwarded by Dr., Thomson, while the
molasses, which by the bye, contains
more than 50 cent, of sugar, is far superior
to that made from any process; indeed
I have never known beet molasses
pure enough for any purpose but distilation
or the feeding of stock, for which
last, however, it is of very great irnportance.
Mr. Webb has the merit of deciding
the question, "Cau good sugar be
made from the corn stalk?" Whether
it can be made to projil, is a second con.
sideration, which he will have it in his
power to determine. The simple mode
of operation which he details, would do
but little in the fabrication of sugar from
the beet; for while there is not the least
difficulty in the process by well appointed
machinery, it is readily admitted that a
considerable portion of art is requisite in
the nujnerous stages of the fabrication of
beet sugar, to free it from impurities
found in the root. With improved appa.
ratus and experience in the present art of
refining, there is no question that loafsugar
may be made by first process from
the corn stalk.
Mr. Webb's modest and unreserved account
of the mode of manufacture will be |
read with very great interest, for if the
corn-grower can be directed to a new
channel for the consumption of half his
crop, in the fabrication of an article of
such legitimate usefulness, the gam to the
community will be of incalculable importance."
Improvsment in making Candles.?The
editor of an exchange paper say9 that bv
making the wicks of candles about half
the common size, and then wetting them
thoroughly with Spirits o Turpentine and
drying them again in the sunshine before
moulding or dipping, they will last longer
and give a much clearei light, than when
made in the ordinary way.
NEW GRASS.
A correspondent of the Albany Cultivator,
writes from Sparta, Ga.. to the editors
of that paper as follows:
"We. nnnarentlv bv the merest acci
-rr; j j %
dent, have, in my opinion, one of the
finest and best grazing grasses in the
world. It is called Bermuda grass, from
tlie fact of its being brought fro'n that Iso
o
land. A gentleman in the southern part
of the state brought it from there as a
yard grass; it found its way into the interior
of the state for that purpose; all animals
are fond of it, and it is believed to contain
as much or more nutriment than any
other grass. We are beginning to cultivate
it. It grows well on poor land, resembles
what is called the wire grass of
this region, takes root at every joint as
that grass does, until the land becomes
covered & a thick turf formed It will grow
on the poorest worn out clay, and even- ,
tually reclaim it, for when the turf is once
formed, nothing is lost to the land by
washing. It has to be propagated
from the root or sprig, as it has no
seed. When once planted it remains for
all time, unless shaded or disturbed by the
plow or hoe. The grazing or treading of
stock has effect imon it after turf is well
------ I
formed, the more exposed to the sun the
greater its luxriance, and mixed with j
white clover, which grows well with it; i
it affords good pasture for ten months in
a year. The herbage is at all times very
thick and tender. Some have objected
to it, because of the difficulty of destroying
it; but one of my neighbors has fine
cotton growing where two years since
this grass was as finely set as I ever saw
it. It will be the salvation of the worn
out lands of Georgia.
LOOK OUT FOR SCOUNDRELS.
There is no doubt from the various feats
of rascality perpetrated in this City, with- |
in a few days past, that we have among
us a set of desperadoes " fatally bent on
on mischief." A few nights ago, the
Western Stage was robbed of two Trunks,
almost within the corporate limits of the
' - L
City, and, almost at the very same sp?n, i
a night or two nfcer, a valuable Trunk
was cut from the travelling Carriage of
Samuel Simpson Esq. ofNewbern. One
night, the present week, a wagoner, who
had encamped in the Baptist Grove, was
knocked down while in the act of kindling
his fire, but not being stunned, he
gave the alarm and the assassin made off,

GOVERNOR'S MESSAGE, No. 1. 1
Executive Department, >
Columbia, Nov. 23d, 1841. $ 1
Fellow'Citizens of the Senate, *
and House of Representatives: .
I congratulate you on the recurrence
of this occasion of assembling in the ser- 8
vice of your constituents, under circum- J
stances as auspicious to the useful discharge
of your duties, as I trust they will ?
be conducive to the harmony of your deliberations.
While, in the general health of our cit- 0
izens. and the abundance of the harvest,
we have experienced the usual boneficent ^
distribution of the blessings of an over- f
ruling Providence, we have not less cause '
for congratulation in *the reviving pros,
perity of out people, from the unexampled 8
depression and embarrassment of the
time*. Wfeady has credit began to re- a
gain confidence and stability-?capital to J
see(c permanent investsments-^-commerce
to pursue its accustomed channels?prop,
ertv to resume a fixed and reasonable
?' ? ~ . t
value?and the energy and enterprise of .
our people to embark with new and invigorated
hope, in its various etnploy- a
ments, and pursuits. 8
Not the least gratifying reflection ari- ^
sing from these cheering auguries of our
condition, is derived from the conscious- J
ness that they are results, not of any
pampering patronage of the Government
?not of the artificial stimulants of Leg- 4
# t
islative aids or interference?but of a
i c
wise and vigilant economy in the people,
awakened by the disastrous experience of J
the past, to improve the permanent and
enduring sources of their prosperity. If
some of the lingering effects of the late s
derangement in the monetary affairs of s
our country are still painfully experienced,
in the reduced value of property, j
?diminished as it must be from the inflated
standard of a depreciated and ex- J
panded curiency?or in the difficulty of
discharging debts, incurred in the floodtide
of extravagant prices, and a redundant
circulation?thev nre to be regarded
&
as the unavoidable consequences of for
mer errors and delusions, and perhaps the ^
surest indications of a progressive state of
convalescence and improvement. ^
Nor have we less cause to exult io the '
hope, that our Government may now be
regarded as having passed in security,
through the mast trying and difficult exi- F
gencies, that ever tried its virtue, or test- '
edits stability, |
In the events of a single year, the sudden
ascendency of a party, actuated by
a high-wrought enthusiasm?impelled by J3
the disasters of the times to seek relief in
change, and rashly imputing them to the
conduct of our Rulers-?seemed to threaten
the subversion of the well-established
principles of '98 and '99, and of the re- J
publican policy of the Government,'as w
well as the overthrow of the exponents, ^
by whom they were administered. But e
a few weeks experience of power, have ^
as suddenly disbanded, dissipated, and re- w
solved this magnificent array of party P
power and organization into its distinct 0
and original elements. The deliberations P
of the late session of Congress have dispelled
the delusions of party-zeal and for. 8
vor. Its impincticable expedients and M
distracted councils have I trust, again P
gathered and assembled the Republican
portion of the nation, in the unity and s'
strength of one fold, and one conviction, d
And if the great measure of "deliverance h
and liberty," important as we still regard it
it to the faithful, a* well as equitable ad- d
ministration of the financial affairs of the h
country, has been repealed, in form and ^
in name, we have still the unquestionable 0
assurance of its final success, in the over- n
ruling necessity resulting from the signal
failure of every other substitute or device.
Among these abortive expedients, none 8
was regarded with more intense and ah- w
- - - IV
sorbing solicitutde, than the proposition to *
re-establish a National Bank. On no s1
occasion has the exercise of the conserva' ^
tive power vested in the Federal Execu- P
tive, been received with warmer approba- 11
tion by the people of this State; or been
more wisely and fortunately interposed, ^
to arrest the most dangerous, and most ^
obnoxious, of all the premeditated viola
tions of the Constitution. Of all the
great measures of national polic)\ pro- ^
ductive of the bitterest contention among P
the great parties of this Union, and n
which has always and justly been regarded "
as fraught with the most powerful influences
(for good or for evil,) on our politi- ei
cal institutions, the establishment of a na- r(
tional Bank, is certainly the most obvious ^
and important. If such has been the ex- 0
perience of the country, in the primitive 0
and purer ages of the Republic, under f
the regulations of a Bank, arising out of 11
the embarrassments of the first war, and P
the exigencies of the last?of Cf?mpara- ^
tively limited capital, and directed by the 0
wisest and ablest officeis?what were we P
to anticipate from an institution organ- n
ized as the instrument of a party then in ^
power?operating amidst the ruins of a ^
disordered currency, and the wreck, s<
weakness, and dismay, of state and local
institutions. The expiring struggles of a
the late United States Bank, to perpetu- n
ate its existence against the fiat of the 9
people, and the constituted authorities of f
the country, are recent in the recollec- ,r
tion of all of us, and form an important Z(
epoch in the history of our Government. Cl
Doubtful as that contest must bo admit* u
ed to have been, waged oven as it was
igainst an Administration, perhaps the
nost efficient and energetic that has ever
'ontroiled the de^inie3 of this nation,
vhat were we to anticipate, when our
Xu\ers themselves should hare become its
lilies, its party, or its pageants. In this
iew, it would have changed the characer
of our Government, become part of
>ur political institutions, and consummaed
the greatest of all the deprecated evils
hat could befall a country?"the union
>f purse and sword, in the Federal head"
?or iror.fe, in the hands of a Federal
arty. Well may such an institution be
opposed to have had the power to reguite
the currency; but it would have
ieen with iron rule of despotism?retraining
all insterest, absorbing all capial,
measuring all profits, overpowering
>11 competition, arid attracting the wealth
?nd prosperity of every other portion of
he Union, to the centre of its operaions.
It was an honest confession, of one of
he ablest presiding officers of the late
Jnited States Bank, before a committee
ippointed by Congress to.investigate its
iffairs, that it was at any time within its
>ower to crush State and local institui<>na

o the institutions chartered by their auhority
! The institutions of the country
o be uprooted and erased at the bidding
>f a heartless, soul-less, cent, per cent.

he States, and the liberties of the people,
o be subjected to the dominion of a
ordid monied Autocracy! And yet,
uch is the supremacy over law, liberty,
nd the constitution, to which such an intitution
would inevitably have attained.
Encroachments upon the liberties of the
teople, in other times and nations, were
o be apprehended from the swords of
onquerers, and the usurpations of ambiious
rulers; hut experience has shown
hat in our own age and country, the
trongest contests to maintain constituional,
and even sovereign rights, haw
teen waged against an ambitious money
wicer, in all its various forms, of Bank

heretore, may we congratulate the cnunry
on having escaped the ambitious
iretensions of an institution which, after
mpcriously dictating the humiliating duy
to the Federal Executive, of violating
lis constitutional obligations, now threatns,
through the vengeance of a disaplointed
party, the rash and iniquitous reribution,
of abolishing the most useful
nd conservative, of all the prerogatives
f his department.
The revision of the duties on imports,
ustly regarded by the people of this State
/ith a solicitude proportioned to the burens
which the Protective Policy has hith.
rto imposed on them, has been made, nei*
her in that spirit of equity or of compromye,
which we had just reason to antici.
ate, from the principles and concession
- ? ? rni i * n* i
t the Act or vx. 1 ne nisiory or ine opo>ition
of the State, to a Tariff for prosction,
can neither be obliterated or forotten.
And the high considerations
rhich actuated her, in consenting to comromise
her interests fot a term of years
d the peace and safety of the Union,
hould be a warning, as well as an inucement
to respect her rights, as well as
er forbearance. While the government
? acknowledged to be disembarrassed of
ebt, and the manufacturing interest peraps
the least oppressed and the most proserous
of any in the Union, the renewal
f a policy by indirect means, which is
ow universally admitted to bear unequ.
Ily upon the productive industry of differnt
portions of the Union, is a most flarant
abuse of power, as well as a most
ranton violation of faith. The living
eneration, who were the witnesses of the
truggles and pledges in the late contest
3r her constitutional rights, have not yet
assed away,?the monuments of the
mes have not yet perished,?the very alirs
consecrated by her vows, still stand
efore us?even her preparations for dejnce,
are still in readiness and requision?the
age, its records, and recollecons,
have scarcely become a part of
istory. before the very burdens and op
ressions which they were intended to
jsist, are renewed with a shameful infielity,
which seeks neither pretext or jusfication.
*A home valuation, cash dutia,
and an unreasonable and exorbitant
jvenue of more than thirty millions, it is
elieved are little less onerous in amount,
r unconstitutional in effect, than the enrmous
forty per cent, duties which the
Dvereignty of this State was so sternly
iterposed to resist. And if, upon the
rinciple of all protective Tluties. they are
i i\ 4 nrrr n vn fn si n pvfftnf! Jlllli On*
rmityto which our experience of the
ast, as well as the tendency of the times,
lost emphatically forebodes, then it will
e for you to say, whether South Carolina
as so fallen from her high eminence of
^vereignty and independence, as to admit
V a silent acquiescence in these wrongs
nd grievances, that there is no 44 mode,
0 remedy, no measure of redress." If
le was sufficient then for the emergency,
ie is doubly adequate and fortified now
1 the union and strength of all her citi3ns,
to meet aggressions upon her rights,
ome from what source they may. Nor
i it less becoming the dignity and char
_ i
| acterofa free State, in assuming a pofi?
j tion of defence which shells resolved to
maintain, to manifest a due and ttmakf
regard for all the means and appliance*
of rendering that positioo, as strong and
impregnable in fact, as it is in equity, and
in argument. Disregarding all theories
that so often confound the convictions of
the best and purest minds, and resorting
to the resources which she can So amply
command through ber organized gov*
I ernment, and with which God and thn
, People have endowed her, there can no
t emergency arise, in which the hands and
the hearts of her citizens, would not be invincibly
united io her defehce.
Another topic, of not less importance
in itself, or of deep moment to tbseitiioaa
of this State, is the act distributing **
proceeds of the public landa& As a source
of revenue which it is proposed to abstract.
at the vary instant wlmjfte.J
Treasury is said to require to be replenished,
it would seem like wantonly' seeking
a pretext to increase taxation. Bui
considered in anv point of view, it can be
regarded in no oiher light than that of a
distribution of the public revenue. la
one year, during a previous administration,
the proceeds of the sales of public
lands, produced a revenue of upward of
twenty millions?a maximum to which, in
more prosperous times, it would pomibly
again attain. Its average may even Doer
be estimated at five millions, which, if
annually withdrawn from the Treasury,
leaves that deficiency at least to be sup*
plied by increased duties on imports.#
That the government can exercise the
power of taxation to raise revenue fot
distribution, is a principle I presume,
which this State is not prepared to admit
Under the operation of the various
preemption laws, and the frequent
reductions in the price of puhlic lands,
those very States which were the largest
contributors' to the " Public Domain' or
whose " blood and treasure" were most
i lavishly expended to acquire it, have at
> the same time been subjected to thn
greatest sacrifices, in the emigration of
> their citizens, and in the diminiahod value
i of their products, reduced by an unequal
competition with the more abundant and
, teeming resources of those new nnd
fertile regions, which their enterprise nnd
i hdustry have been seduced and abstrae*
ted to cultivate, to the waste and abandonment
of their own. It was enough to
; have borne all this with patriotic devotion
to the interests of our common country;
but when it is proposed to divert that
> domain from the sacred purposes for which
' it was ceded, to afford a pretext for addii
tional burdens and taxation on one class
of industry, to give protection and bounty
to another, it assumes a character of the
highest injustice, as well at the most
palpable infraction of conttitutionaJ
principles.
But the most dangerous, as well at the
must humiliating effect of this measure, ie
the condition of dependency, to Which it
reduces the States, upon the bounty and
benefaction of the government?existing
as they would, in the relation of subsidia**
ies upon the profits of their own estatereceiving
its charity, doled out from their
own wealth, and subdued to a state of
homage, servility, and compliance, by
bribes, stolen and lavished from theis own
Treasury. Is it not to be regarded aa
the first step to the assumption of State
debts?designed tocensummate a console
dation of interests, obliterating all distinctions
of sovereignty, or pride of independence,
and tending to concentrate Empira
and Dominion over the rights of the States,
and the liberties of the people?
I trust, however, that* the spirit of
