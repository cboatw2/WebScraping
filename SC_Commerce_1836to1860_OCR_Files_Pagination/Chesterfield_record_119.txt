DAVENPORT'S ELECTRO-M AGNE. 1
. TIC MACHINE.
W e ai*o aware of the public an\i*t'y to be \
informed ofthe progrsss of this important
. invention, and therefore we shall watch the i
* " improvements and experiments of Messrs. \
Davenport and Cook, with the view of re- J
porting'tbem .as . interesting developments, j
. are made. We "mentioned on Saturday that j
xr, iWxx^u^hutLco^nnleted a magnetic
wheel of t wel ve inehes in diameTcr, ~ writc-tr t
in its operation,, as we were lnloniied, set
ties tlte (question of increase of powcand it j
mav now be.considered certain th . Elcc- j
tro-Magnetism can be applied to machinery J
to an indefinite extent. We expect to be j
able to examine the enlarged engine so as to J
" give particulars to our readers in a day or
two. .
Iii answer (o enquiries respecting the
Juints Stock Association, now being formed,
for the purpose of supplying Messrs.
Davenport and Cook with funds to enable j
them to pursue iheir experiments on an enlarged
scale, we think proper to s ate that
the terms offered to those disposed to take j
an interest in this great invention are most j
liberal. By the articles of association, '
which \ve [tave examined, it appears that tlie;
number ofshares in the Company is 3000, ,
of which the proprietors propose to sell 1000,
but at present they only offer 200 shares, at
one hundred dollars per share. That they ..
are a good investment, even in the present
state of the invention, is evident, when we,
consider to how many purposes the* power
already obtained is applicable. Who w ill j
attempt to estimate the value of these shares .
when force*sufficient is developed to propel
the largest vessels, or to move the heaviest!
. machinery for manufactories ?
It is u highly important consideration that 1
Electro-Magnetic power may be multiplied
in its application without being exhausted.
Thus, if we can obtain enough force to move
i?ne\snindle for spinning Cotton, one thou- j1
sand or five thousand spindles may bo turn, J '
ed by the same galvanic orelectric current, j1
whhout any increase of power. Each spin.!'
die being jnade magnetic, and all of them IJ
connected with wires, the whole of them may I?
be operated by the wires front only one gal*- : J
vanic- battery. This fact is admitted by all ]
scientific men, as far as we have heard. I
Tims it will be seen that all the spindles in i
any Cotton Manufactory i? America or Eu- j?'
rope may be set and continued in motion j 1
^ by one of Davenport's small machines. It j t
is not necessary however, to stop here, as t
no rgason c$n be given why the power may j 1
not he indefinitely increased. ; i
We take the liberty of making an csti- i
mate of the value of the invention, supposing j t
the ingenious proprietors to go no Atrther,; i
feeling confident at the'same time, that we : J
i- nc thn rirrliK I ;
are under uictnarK.pur.iuuiai i\ ug MiV ;
of the patent are secured in Europe which.' ?
we do not include. j t

In reference to thq means necessary to J

important invention! we regret that our Government

without specific "appropriation, be obtained

Is it possible that any persons, who have not
entirely taken leave- of their senses', would
propose petitions from minors to be presented i
to -Congress, on any subject whatever, and j
that too. without limitation of age, or circum- j
stances'? Wlio could .not go through our j
cities, towns, villages, farm houses, and schools,
and procure millions of names of children in i
tins way, to any thing that might be written
or presented to them, unless their gaurdians
or parents should be sufficiently watchful to
prevent the imposition. Parents and guardians
are not accountable to any hut their
tinal judge, for what, principles they may teach
their chiidren and wards; but to enlist minors
in petitioningCongress^n any. subject, and
that, too; wiuiout nmrtation ofuge is ccrtnmiy
carrying matters a step farther than we had
ever imagined wise men or sober men would
attempt. _ ..
When we read this proposition, we were
forcibly' reminded of the prophesy of Isaiah,
iil. 12. "As for my people children are their
oppressors and women rule over them."
We greatelv prefer the following extract
from the same paper to the petitions- of children
above recommended. It is a part of a
pastoral letter, reported to one of the General
Associations of New England.
a t
' The-appropriate duties and influence
of women arc clearly stated in the New
Testament. Those duties and that influence
ara unob:rysivs and private, but the
sources of mighty power. When the mild,
dependant sof;euing influence of woman
upon the sternness of roan's opinions is fuh (
ly exercised, society feels tiki effects of it in
a thousand forms. * The power of woman ,
is in her dependance flowing from the consciousness
of that weakness which God lias
given her for her protection, and which keeps ,
her in those departments of life that form
the character of individuals and of the na- ,
lion. There are social influences which females
use in promoting piety and the great
objects of christian benevolence, which we ,
cannot too highly recommend. [W e ap. 1
predate the unostentatious prayers and
efforts of woman in advancing the cause'of
religion at home and abroad : in Sabbath 'I
Sciiools, in leading religious inquiries to the ,
pastor for instruction, and in all such asso- ,
ciated efforts as becomes tlie modesty of her ,
sex ; and'earnestly hope thaishe may abound ;
more and more in the labors of piety and .
love. ] But when she assumes the place !
md tone of man as a public reformer, our
:are and protection seem unnecessary, we |
)Ut ourselves in self defence against her, she
yields tta power which tfod has given her J
or protrciion, and her character becomes '
.innaturnh If the vine, whose streng'h and
eeautyis to hang upon the trellis work and
ialf conceal its clusters, thinks to assume
.he independence'and the overshading na? {
uro of the elm, it will not only cease to
>ear fruit, but fall in shame and dishonor
nfo the dust. ^
We cannot, therefore, hut regret the misaken
conduct of those who encourage fe?
nales to bear an obtrusive and ostentatious
)art in measures of reform, and countenance
inv of that sex who so far forgot themselves
" # 4
is to itineraie in the character of public lee- j
urers and teachers. 1
We especially deplore the intimate nc- ]
paintance and promiscuous conversation }j
)f females with regard to things41 which j j
3ught not be named by which that mod- j
osty and delicacy which is the charm of do- 1
mcslic life, and which constitutes the true j
influence of women in society is consumed,!
and the way opened, as we apprehend, for , <
degeneracy and ruin. We say these things, |
not to discourage proper influences against"!4!
sin, but to secure such reformation as we |
believe is scriptural and will be permanent.' j

Grand Imperial Vegetable Renovator.
Doctor JansCn Von Humbug, a graduated
disciple'of the great "Royal Seminary
of Luiiatico?Medicos" of Barafaria. founded
by his-illustrious brother the Baran Von
Humbug, lias the distinguished lionor to j
inform rife citizens of the Borough of West j
Chester, that he has taken an office of a fe.\v
doors from the ''Insane Hospital," where
he can be found by any who may require,
his professional services or his invaluable
medicine. The system of Baron Voii Humbug
is short & simple being the application of
a single medicine, and having been fully
tested by countless millions within the las!
thirty years has been found to be the only
true system yet-discovered that will infalliably
cure "all tho ills that flesh is heir to.".
It comprises not within itseifany ofthoSe
poisonous compounds, mercury, antimony,
No. 4, No. 5, arsenic, No. 6, Cayenne,
Lobelia, dec., which physicians, Quack and
Emnerical Pretenders make use of, at the
risk of destroying the vital energies and
constitution of the patient: neither does it
embrace the materials' oflhose infalliable
pills-which wlicn taken in proper quantities
arc said to heal a hole in a man's'coat, or
grow his hps together in a single night, but
it is mild and pleasant in its nature and
and operation, being compounded of a vege- j
table'found by a Barattiria Lunatic in a lu- |
cid interval, whilst searching for bird's nests ;
in a mangrove swamp, and tints providen-1
tialiy brought into notice- for the benefit of j
an afflicted world.
Wen we look around us and see so many-!
dying daily, the strong man and the brave, j
thn ynungnnd the beautiful, are we pot kept j
continually lachrymose and melancholy,and j
do not ask yourselves why this should be i
so? To those who understand it, the rea- j
sons is obvious.. It is that the pa i ;nt lias;
not taken the fvijeeb Brjwmu, the Grand !
Imperial Renovator, which cures all diseas- |
es, heals all wounds, sets dislocated limbs, 1
makes the blind walk and the lame see,
and restores to pristine vigor and health
with the greatest facility ten out of nine that
have been given over by Thotnsonian and
all kinds of Physicians.
Come tlien all ye afflicted to the Fountain j
of Health, drink of its pleasant waters,laste !
of the Kajeeb Brjwmn, and whether ye be
afflicted with gout, or with rheumatism,
with cancers, canker, coughs cholera, or

to resist its unparalleled potency.
The Kajeeb Brjwmn is in such astonishing
repute and demand, that the illustrious
Baron Von Humbug is obliged to employ
fourteen Steam Engines-and tiiree thousand
laborers in the manufacture, and has
appointed agents to Vend it, in England

the Porte is a Yankee, (where oil, or under, 1

I stands high-at Court, and saved the vessel |n
i-from trouble. On entering Constantinople a
: j (May 26) she gave no salute, it having been 11

: he would throw his powder away.
j. The Queen of England shows that she is a ; r'j
.: Whig in. the selection of her Maids of Honor, j *
and in the gentlemen about her Court. There i "

: This is packet day. About 100,000 dollars a*
in specie, I suppose, will go out to day. The a'
j last packets maiTe such a heavy haul upon the cl
1 brokers, that the purchasers quite swept the 1
! shops, and specie is somewhat scarce. It is u:
1 lucky that the demand was not great. ; &
i The Postmaster Geueral and the Attorney w
( General are in this city. It is said that they a,

! should like to know how they would bring 1tl

went to his birth to ascertain the nature of
the injury. Mackie told him if he advanced
an inch he would stab him, which he did,
piercing his arm. Hand cuffs were Ordered
