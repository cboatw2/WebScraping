A SHARK HUNT.
BV LIRCT. COL. HAMILTON SMITH. I
Curaooa, every one knows, is an island suffi.
eieutly near the North coast of South America to
to show, from the higher windows of the town, the
mou'itia:v of San Martha, and the region about
iolfo Dolce, in their distant haze, yet distinct and j
high above the deep indigo-colored sea. Along
the Southern shore tlie c urrent sets, with velocity,
toward lite gulf of Mexico, and the sight is like a
fairy picture, when running down the coast, be- (
ctrnnir b/.;i hrcezc. with studding and all j
AVIV fciftV Otivu^ wvv. ,
available sails set, we approach the land in a glow- j
ing sun under the sky-blue vault of heaven. The
shore 011 the starboard, close at hand, exhibits its
rising and falling sindy hillocks, scantily besprinkled
with turtle grass. It recedes and opens to
salt lagunas. The surf breaks but slightly on the
beach, but flying fish start up and skim above the
waters; dolphins or other depredators bound up to
the surface ; gulls, terns, and boobies wheel along
the skies, and all nature seems to dance in the smiling
prospect. If sharks are then in the wake of
the ship, they are not visible, because all their powers
are in exerV*n to keep way with her.
Soon, on the starboard bow, the roofs of houses,
and a fort, are descried, the ship hugging the shore
still more closely. Studding sails arc taken in j
with rapidity; sky-scrapers, royals, top-gallant
sails are clewed up ; the word "stand by to haul
to the wmd" is given ; the forecastle is all bustle,
with heaving anchors over the bows, while ranging
cable is going on below. Punta Brava battery is
* " 4 * *?*1" ? <?lncD (n ctarhnnrH !
right ahead ; r on. muMauam ? T
"haul to the wind !" "helm hard a port!" is the
word, and the ship, creaking under the pressure of
her topsails, bends as she makes a sudden angle in
her course and shoots into the harbour. Tacks
and sheets are let fly, and the anchors suddenly let
go in a narrow channel, and in the midst of hou
tK.fi, for the harbour is only 100 fathoms wide,
forming a canal two miles in length toward the
North, where it opens into a magnificent basin,
entirely land-locked, where ships of the largest
class can and do anchor.
In the harbor, when looking at the landscape
from the niain-top of a man-of-war, the observer is
struck with a general resemblance to the grand <
eanal of Venice, but that here the scale is far more |
great, and the houses as much less. Still the
view is serene: all beyond the town is yellowish I
sand or rock ; before the eye is a peaked hill,
crowned with a small citadel, overlooking the inner I
basin on one side and the town on the other. The J
landscape has little atmosphere ; all the houses
are white; all the roofs, with their Dutch pan.
tiles, look red ; all the window shutters are green ;
ail the population in sight is black, almost all,
more or less, bespatched with white ; the waters
are bright cerulean; beneath, to seaward, they
are dark blue, so that the whole scene^TJoks as if
it were a pasteboard imitation, entirely painted in
positive colors. This effect extending even to the I
shadows, and still more forcibly scecn when the i
spectator looks down from the citadel, or from any >
other elevated point upon the objects beneath <
them. ?
It was this place which Sir Charles Brisbane, 1
commanding a squadron of four heavy frigates, <
surprised at dawn of day, on a new year's morn- <
ing, by dashing, with a similar manoeuvre, into i
the harbor, and awakening the astonished Du'ch : I
with the broadsides of his cannon, even uncere- <
moniously entering the bed rooms of ladies with 1
the bowsprit end, for the water is so deep, close to
the shore, and the houses so ncor, that one frigate I
ran her jib boom in at a garre t window, to the in- i
expressible dismay of an old woman. i
It is now about 36 years since that evant, and a I
few days after that the regiment I belonged to Ian- <
ded and took possession of the fortifications, when <
it fell to my lot to command the Autrebanda, or 1
--'-I? . A mctor>)Qin inh:iKifpH Hv* I I

above half of the population. With two compa- I
ni< s in quarters beneath nic, facing the harbour I
and fort, I had a view over all that occurred, j
could watch the numerous punts or flats here 1
used, with which negroes scull across in all dircc- i
tions, and observe the dense black population, li- i
ving on the beach, bargaining or selling fruit and 1
vegetables, fishing or frying fish, while slim little 1
forms, of nearly naked black girls, gracefully balanced
trays on their heads, with cocoa nut, sweet- i
meets or bundles of small fry, crying "Pesca,"or 1
44 Candcla." The ships, decked out in their na- i
tional colours, often hailed from the shore, and ;
boats, hurrying in various directions, were all in I
view. At night it was pleasing to hear music, i
and watch parties of pleasure on the water, then 1
smooth, black and glassy, reflecting the thousand |
lights from the open windows of all the bordering i
houses, or burning among the crowd in the open I
air, and reverberating the thousand voices from I
both shores. At all times whole troops of the ]
black inhabitants are there observed bathing and
(porting in the water, as if it was their natural I
element, making the concentrated vitality all the I
more lively, because the misery of a long starva- i
tion, during repeated blockades, began to wear
away.
With these images in mind, the reader will un- 1
derstand the scene which occurred one evening, a
s ort time after I hud witnessed a large troop of
le nymphs gambolling in their favorite element,
a id playing their national game of 44 bob my
n lighhors head." This can be played at only by
s -Vjinmers such as they are, who verily surpass the
otter in familiarity with the water. The joke appears
to consist in making a kind of a somerset
dive, po that the heels come up in sight and 6tnke
the surface forcibly, and the skill of the game is to
time and aim the manoeuvre so dexterously that
they hit the head and neck of another swimmer,
who may have that moment just emerged from a
plunge, and is then forcibly, and before breath can
be taken, ducked down again. This feat is sure
to raise loud shouts of laughter from the other
porpoises, who arc seen tumbling about with their
tawney soles flickering above water in all directions.
In a land where clothing is very scanty,
and the sensations produced by cold water arc
pleasant, spectators, in thousands, being close to
the scene, it is no wonder where all are expert,
that one hundred and fi'ty or two hundred are excited
to plunge in and partake of the sport.
After w itnessing from the balcony the scene
just described, I had gone in to dress, when old
- 1 '' c" ?'I 1?.?1. tk> fltoal or rhicf
jvynnccr ? an ciarKenuurgii, uic
justice of the island, came in, requesting my company
in his boat to go up the harbor to his countryhouse,
called Buitenzorgh, where I had not yet
been. 41 It is up the lagoon," said he, 44 where
there arc trees and as much verdure as this island
can boast of. There are prints and books, and it
is really a cool and pleasant retreat, although it i?
sometime* haunted in an unaccountable way, to
perceived, as the fiscal pointed to the spot, another
belt of human swimmers who had been roused on
the first cry to take the water, and still more violently
engaged.
Advancing from the upper end of the harbor,
they prevented the monster reaching the great lagoon,
where he would infallibly have escaped, and
drove him down within the narrow space between
the houses. There were troops of vociferous
swimmers divided into bands, advancing and pursuing
until my eye caught sight of the great dorsal
fin of the fish, who, it was now evident, was
in utter dismay, shooting rapidly from space to
space, endeavoring to switn low beneath the surface
; but even eight or nine fathoms of depth left
him no passage. Men and women in whole masses
darted down in the deep and scared him upward.
Once he made a dash to pass under the
piles of Mr. Ba&dcn's wharf, and got entangled.?
I could see him struggle to effect it; but furious in
his rage, it was visible that he was blown. He
now made no farther effort, under water, swimming
half his back high above the surface J once
ar twice he lay motionless, his snout and eyes
pite visible, and seemingly deliberating upon a
Scree resolve. But anon he was roused by a troop
;oming on him, he started like lightning, his tail
fjuivering ; and now and then lashing the water
into foam, he dashed at the middle of the seaward
belt, which instantly redoubled in clamor and in
jiving, while all from above harbor came down in
Full cry.
The shark plunged and then rose, shooting in
;he violence of action his whole length above the
surface, which glittered like a flash of silver in the
sloping sun. Down again he went, darting along
the line to the deepest side, under Fort Amsterjam
; but here the crowd and noise, the beating
)f the water with sculls and oars from the shore,
was most intense. He came up again, turned
toward the upper harbor, floundered, uncertain of
lis purpose, and then started again with rapidity
to the side where we stood. Here he nearly
grounded, but he fought off; his speed, however,
wasexhausted; he ran a short way upward, and then,
in a rather lubberly way, come on shore on our
jide, at a little distance off, and hardly moved a
fin before an axe was lifted and his tail cut off.
This was a signal for a universal shout of triumph.
He was by no means one of the largest, measuring
something less than eleven feet in length, but
was a true Squalus Car chariot, or raging shark,
most dreaded by seamen. With all his voracity
and fierceness this shark is a real coward, as I had
long before witnessed at Dominica. A drunken
man, floating on the water, was about to be devoured
by one of great size one morning, while our
people were washing the decks, when four seamen
sprang overboard and scared him away, towing
the drunken fellow on shore, where they gave
liim a sound thrashing by way of caution for the
Future.
Boats or punts must be kept on shore during the
battle with a shark, because, in the violent exertions
used, their oars and bottoms might strike
the swimmers or protect the fish.

COMBAT BETWEEN A MVNGOOZE AND COBRA
CAFELLA.
Being desirous of seeing a combat between
a snake and its inveterate enemy,
the mungooze (an animal similar to the
icheumnn of Egypt.) I requested the
charmer to exhibit a fight of the kind.
He instantly consented (as every one of
these men carries not only snakes, but
mungoozes with them) and led us out into
the compound?the field attached to
almost every house in cantonments. Having
expressed our fears lest any of the
party might be injured bv the reptile, he
proposed that the exhibition should take
place under an enormous pheasant coop of
worked wire, which was lying unused in
the court yard. Th:s arrangement was
acceded to, and, at our suggestion, the
snake first taken in the morning was selected
for the encounter. The rnouth of
the vessel in which he was enclosed was
placed under the edge of the coop and the
covering suddenly withdrawn. In a moment
^fter the cobra capella darted out.
The kedgeree pot was then taken awav,
and the edges of the pheasanty le.t down.
During two or three minutes the monster
poked his nose all around the enclosure,
evidently wishing to escape ; but, finding
his impossible, he quietly coiled himself
up, freeirg, however, his magnificent
h< ad from the folds, and remained in a
?ort of listening attitude.
Presently the man produced the mun'ooze,
and let,him in to his advers&fV.

I the destruction of mv wife's fine china, and the
| terror of my people." I was just going to ask for
some further explanation, when such a sudden
! yell arose, such a confusion of shouts and screams,
as made me instantly start up and grasp my [
sword, intending to rush down and turn out the j
guard, for there evidently was some terrible disss- i
ter in occurrence. Before I reached the ante- j
-k0,niu>r fr>r<r<'tfni nf the worthv fiscal. I met his I
ViKWfWf J r
orderly, {guide de chasse,) a mulatto, adorned I
with sword and belt. 44 Het is een Haayvisch, I
mynheer," said he, taking off his hat, and speak.
ing Dutch, the official language of Curacoa, the
vernacular being Pupicmento, a kind of broken
Spanish,?44 Het is een Haayvisch," (it is a shark.)
44 Ja," interrupted Markus, the fiscal's waiting
boy, 44 een Haayvisch ould dc vrouwen," a (shark
amongjthe women.) 44 The devil," quoth I;44 Mr.
Fiscal, what can be done to save these poor girls ?"
Iwondered at the quiet gravity of my good natured
friend on this, to my mind dangerous occasion.
He 6miled and said, 44 Oh ! captain, don't
be uneasy, but go and see, for it will be a scene
you shall never forget 1" and with these words he
cume with me to the head of the balcony stairs.
It was certainly an exciting moment; all were
in the water; all were vociferating and
uttering the most discordant noises imaginable.
The punts were already run on shore, in order to
enable the scullers to partake of the sport; the
harbor was every where studded with human
heads above the water, forming a kind of shoal;
and a whole dense line of swimmers barred the
entrance from the fort to opposite my house,
chiefly, and mo6t numerous, in the deepest water,
which they beat with their hands, and incessantly '
diving and plunging, presented a tumultuous belt
from shore to 6hore. Some negro boys and girls,
attempting to enter, were driven back by the oth.
ers, and it was some time before the real object of
excitement could be made out. I had asked, rerepeatedly,
*4 Where is he ?" 44 Wagt een heetje,
mynheer," wait a little was the reply, and I now i
| Never was I more surprised. This was
the first time I had seen one. 1 had ex.
pected to behold h somewhat powerful op.
ponent. Never coirftf f have fancied that ;
so small an animal would have dared to
cope with serpents of the largest and deadliest
kind ; such, however, was the case.?
The little creature which now sniffed
round the edge of the coop was about
half as large again as an English rat, of a
mottled color, with small ied eyes, and
would have been a very ugly animal had
it not been for his tail, which was long,
and bushy in circumference near the
centre, almost as large as the little body
to which it was attached. For a time

direct up to the snake, which, however,
having perceived its tormentor on its first
entrance, had prepared to give him battle.
Suddenly the tiny creature, which seemed !
to be little more than a single mouthful j
to its adversary, saw the snake, and with- |
out hesitation ran at him. So apparent!y
unequal a contest I never beheld. The
cobra capella had reared itself and spread
out its hood, a sort of fleshy cape it inflates
when irritated, and which has given
rise to its designation. The marks round
its eyes resembled a pair of spectacles.
Its marble stained scales seemed all alive,
as it raised itself some three feet high to
meet the attack of the little savage,
whose fiery eyes seemed suddenly to plow
like red hot cinders, as it rushed towards j
its mighty enemy, and bit it.
The snake darted at it, squeezed it, inflicted
its dreadful wound, and then threw <
itself hack. The mungooze was evidentry
disabled. Faint and almost dying, it
letreated. Many of us fancied the battle
over, and regretted the untimely end of
the courageous little beast. After limp
ing about for some time and even lying
down with exhaustion, the mungooze be. i
gan to poke its nose on the grass. What |
it swallowed none have ever been able to
trace, though large rewards have been of.
fered for the discovery.?What the herb
is which thi- little animal partakes of,
none can fell, hut certainly its effects arc
miraculous ; for. no sooner did the creature
imbibe the sought for antidote, than
it suddenly recovered its pristine strength,
and again attacked the serpent. This
scene was re.enacted no less than seven
times; each time the cobra appearing
weaker and weaker, till actually tired out.
The mungooze at length succeeded in
catching the monster by the throat, nnd
destroying if, to the surprise and odmiration
of all present.

Revised by a Committee of Scientific and

of M.T. Bailey, Member of the Societies
of Agricultural and Horticulture. Translated
from the French, with Notes adapting it to the

Agriculture is the foundation of all human
arts?the art for which man was made, and
the perfection of which is his chief happiness
and glory as the lord temporal of this planet*
Ofthis8ublime art, all other arts and sciences
are but satellites, their business being to wait
cn, enlighten, and adorn it with their moonshine.
Consequently no man more than the
agriculturist needs the full use of his brains,
I and a perfect command of all the treasures of
human experience. So the farmers of the
United States view the matter; and in presenting
thein with a translation of the cele.
brated Maison Rustique, of the French, we
have no doubt of their hearty support. It ic
the work of all works on praclical agriculture
?the most scientific, clear, and ccmprehensive,
France has long excelled in profitable
farming. This is the source of her wealth.
England is rich by coals and commerce. Her
agriculture is "splendid, but sometimes costs
more than it comes to. Those who have
fortunes to spend may buy the vast works of
Marshall, Dickson Arthur Young, Loudon, 1
&c., but those who wish to get a fortune out
of the soil will find the t rench writers oeuer ,
able to show ihctn the way. The excellence \
of French elementary works is well known to j
all teachers. For centures, the Maison
Rustique has been, in France, the standard
elementary work?the spelling book and
grammar of farming. The present edition for
" the nineteenth century,'* has been re'-written
and brought up with the " march of mind/'
by sixty of the ablest "agronome3" of France. |
It has all the light of the latest improvements, ,
not only in Frauce, but in all Europe.
William Cobbet, one of the most successful \
farmers both in England and America, who 1
wrote the best style and the best French
grammer that over was, valued the Maison i
Rustiques, not only as an encyclopedia of t
farming, but us a means of educating his (
children. He was his own schoolmaster. In '
winter evenings his family resolved itself into
a school, and he thus speaks of the use then
made of this work:?
" Our book of never failing resource was
the French Maison Rustique. or Farm House,
M-h'ch. it is said, was the book that first temp,
ted Dugnosnois (I think that was his name,) i
the famous physician in the reign of Louis
XIV., to learn to read. Here are all the four- r
legged animals, from the horse down to the v
mouse, portraits and all; all the birds, reptiles,
insects; all the modes of rearing managing,
and using the tame ones, and of destroying
thosethat are mischievous; all the varions
traps, springs, nets; all the labors of (he field

platen; and there was I, in any leisure moments,
to join this inquisitive group, to read
the French, and tell them what it meaned in
English, when the picture did not sufficiently t
explain itself. I never have been without a ]
copy of this book for forty years, except during y
the time that I was fleeing from the dungeons of
Casllereagh and Sidmouth, in 1817, and t
when I got to Long Island, the first book 1 >
bought was another Afaison Rustique.*'?Ad- [
vice to Young Men, Art. 291. (
Of the qualifications of the translator, it may r
be said that he is a practical farmer, and in a
regard to his translation of La Fontaine, which g
has been reprinted in England, an English re* a
viewer confesses that he 44 does not know the a
English writer who could have done it better.'"
