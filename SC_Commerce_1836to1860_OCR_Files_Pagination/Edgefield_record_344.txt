WAsBINGToN, Feb. 29, 1840.
'the Senate did not sit to-day. The
weather is delightful, and many of the
Senators have embraced the opportunity
of it, to make short excursions to the
neighboring cities. The business of the
Senate is far in advance of that of the
House, and they iight as well pause
where they are, for the House will do io
more business this season. Every thing
in the way of.business, public or private,
must stand still till the Presidential elec
tion is over. The whigs are making im
mense exertions to carry their candidate ;
and they have assumed a tone of confi
dence which has been quite unusual with
then; but upon what grounds their expec
tation of success is founded, does not ap
pear. They say that the administration
party is disorganised and broken up. In
this, I apprehend, they are mistaken,
though there have certainly been some
signs of dissension in their ranks. The'
strength of the administration in the north,
is with the rural population,-the small
farmer and laborers-and they'are slow to
change. Sonic doubt has been expressed
here, whether South Carolina and Geor
gia would vote for Mr. Van Buren, but
the prevailing opinion is that they will.
Should they throw away their votes, it is
barely possible that the election before the
people tuay be defeated.
March 3.
The proposition for the adjournment of
Congress in May, is the topic of much con
versation. Mr. Lumpkin and Mr. Web
ster, representing the two opposite parties
in the Senate, strongly advocated it.
They tirged that the tendency to prolonged
sessions was increasing; that much time
was in consequence wasted, and the ex
penses of the Government utnecessarily
increased; that Congress would not begin
to do any thing until the day of adjourn
ment was fxed; and that every subject of
public importance, before Congress, could
easily be disposed of early in May. The
resolution is soon to be called, and I have
no doubt it will pass the Scnate. As to
the House, it is thought they will refuse to
fix any day, until the appropriatioin bills,
the Sub Treasury bill, and some other
public bills are acted upon.
The disposition towards economy and
retrenchment begins to manifest itself very
strongly, in speeches, and in some small
matters of expense. But no extensive or
permanent retbrm can be expected. In
the first place, the annual appropriation
for the Cumberland Road will be withheld
for the present year. At least, there is a
strong indication that the views of the
South, in regard to that subject will now
be respected, so far as to postpdne the
regular appropriation till after the Presi
dential election is decided.
In the next place, the House has, this
morning, rejected a resolution from the
Committee on Commerce to print a Chart
of the mouth of Savannah river and the
neighboring coasts, thus saving some twen
ty thousand dollars. This resolution was
advocated very zealously by Mr. Haher
sham, of Georgia, who dwelt with much
force on the importance to navigation and
commerce, of the Savannah river. The
abuse of printing, by thousauds and tens of
thousands of useless charts and maps, is
one that the House ought to correct, but,
in the present instance, they have selected
an improper subject for their economy.
The salary of the Commissioner of Pen
sions was also reduced, this day, by a vote
of the House, from three ihousand to twen
ty-five hundred dollars. The Senate will
not, I think, concur; for it is manifestly un
just and invidious to take up a 'inigle olfl
cer and make a victim of him, while all
the rest escapc. There is, perhaps, less
reason for reducing thte salary of this off
cer than almost any othiet under the Gov
ernment. There would certainly be much
more propriety in reducing the pay and
mtileage of members of Congress.
From the Wfasington Globe
DEFININo A PoStTioN.-W~e published in
our paper of Monday the following resolu
tion, adopted at a. meeting of tho Anti
slavery Society of New Jersey:
'-Resolved, That the E xecutive Com
mittee is directed to nominate a delegate
or delegates from the Society, to attend.
the conference of Antislavery delegates to
be held itn London, Great Britain, on the
12th of June,1840."
Thus it a ppears that the A bolitionists are
co-oper-.ting with a foreign influence to
overthrowv the intstitutions of their country.
Is not this downtight treason? Or, if not.
wihat is it? If any class, or society, or
association of mneu in the United States,
wvhere to affliate with a foreign association,
whose avowed object was the overthrowv
ofor civil institutions and Government.
would not this be dlownright treason? Yet,
uder cover of an abstract principle, sup
ported neither by Holy writ nor. human
lame, the Abolitionists are gradually mat
uring, in conjunction wvith a foreign nation,
with which our relations at this moment
are in a critical state, a close and intimate
union of purpose, which, if consummated,
will bring a large number of citizens of the
United States ttuto a direct subserviency to
the views atnd interests of Great Britain.
The leading fundamental principle of the
Abolitionists is, that the speedhy and utter
annihilation of slavery in the United States
is a consideration paramount to all and
every other. For tho attainmenit of this,
they have, over and over, declared to the
world that the destruction of the Constitu
tion is nothing -that the dissolution of the
Union is nothing.
Holding these principles, and carrying
them out with a ferocious perseverance,
can any one doubt for a moinent that they
are ready to aid Gren: Britain, or any othier
Power in the destruction of the white man
for the emancipation of the black? If they
are so ready fur co-operation in time of
peace, will they not co-opearate in time of
war? Will they nut lend their assistance
in ravaging the South, and robibing its in
habitants of their lives and property?
Who canjioubt it? Their avowed prin.
eiples lend directly to this course?. They
*ra pledged to it; for they maintain that
all otherduties, all other considerations
must yield to the amancipatiou ofthe slave.
-nothing but a vitiated principle, at war
with the rights of himanity. For this
they send delegates to jEngland, to blast
the reputation of their country by false
and exaggerated tales of the oppression of
the slave, (which is liberty compared with
the burdens ofthe English laboter) and
for this they stand ready to give aid and
comfort to any power that will invade
this country, under pretence of achieving
his emancipation.
From the Southern Patriot.
We regret to perceive that the spirit of
peace and conciliation, which, with heal
ing on its wings', had visited our city after
our late bitter and inost unhappy party
contest, is once more about to take flight
from among us. We do hope that the
influential members of both parties will
unite and restrain the inferior men who
expect to derive political or personal ad
vantage from the revival of that fatal feud.
We did not hear Mr. McDuffie's Eulogy.
There appears to be much difference of
opinion among even those who have polit
ically acted together during the last con
test, as to the tenor of his remarks. Some
of the Union Party, with whom we have
conversed, think that those remarks could
not be deemed offensive. to the Union
Party-others think diffierently. Council
have requested the publication of Mr.
McDuffie's Eulogy. Let us wait and see
how this clashing evidence is to be recon
ciled. Let Mr. McDuffie he heard, no'
through the voices of others, but thuitmgn
his own acknowledged, and accredited
-speech.
We feel it incumbent on us, therefore,
as the conductor of a Journal that largely
partook of the feelingi and participated in
the irritations engendered ly the late con
troversy, not to enlarge, but to endeavor
to heal, the breach which is about to open,
and may widen into an impassable gulph.
Uutil we have evidence that the Nullifiers,
as a party. not taking the opinion or dec
larations of any one of that party, as an
exponent of the whole are insincere it
their late movements and acts, we cannot
but implore the considerate members of
the Union party, and we may add, of both
parties, to interpose ibeir healing councils
before matters are brought to extremities.
The Nullifires have given a proof of late
of their conciliatory disposition, by the a
doption of a highly esteemed member of
the Union Party as their Candidate for
Governor. Let us have evidence that
this offering on the altar ofcontinued har
mony, is not made itt the sincerity of such
as worship peace in the spirit of peace, be
fore we alienate those who should think
and act at the present crisis in a brother
hood of political feeling. This is a period
too portentous to Southern interests to
allow forgotten feuds and fatal divisions to
spring tip in the minds of Southern Cum
inunities.
From the Greenville Mount aineer.
There are three gentlemen spoken of
for that office, viz: Col. Richardson, Judge
David Johnson and Col. Hammond. We
have very little doubt but Col. R. will be
the one selected for the office, notwith
standing the opposition of a few violent
partizans. He belonged to the Union Par
ty throughout the Nullification contest, and
will probably be opposed by sonic of the
members of the then dominant party.
le is said to be in favor of the present
Administration and tle Sub-Treasury, and
will therefore meet with opposition from
the friends of Mr. Clay and the Banks,
who were attached to foit the old patties.
Col. Richardson is a gentleman of fine
talents, and has filled the various posts to
which he has been called, with honor to
himself and satisfaction to his constituents.
We know of no matn in the State who is
better qualifl'ed to fill the Gubernatorial
chair, and we shall be highly gratified if
he is selected for that station. The nomni
nation was first tmade by the former oppo
nents of Col. R., and was intended as a
kind of sulro for healingt the divisiotns
which recently prevailed in this State, atid
more firmly cementing the union that nowv
exists Under these considerations, alone,
wye hail the nominiation as the most ap~pro
priate that could have beetn made.
From the Charlestoni Mercury.
The grounds otn which the Sub-Treas
try party in our State can consisrtntly
support Col. Richardson and not Judge
.Johmnson, are very plain.
Our candidate muitst be opposed to a
Natiotnal Bank, as itnexpedlenut anid uncon
stitutional.
He must be in favor of the Sub-Treas
ury, tcithi the specie clause.
He must have been with us openly and
actively through the struggle' against the
Nationals, and in favor of the Sub-Treas
TFhe Stil-Treasury party 'in Carolina is
the only State Rights party in our State.
A Nullifier who is not of it is against us.
A Union man who is for it is with us.
To be at all connected politically with
the known follower of Clay in this State.
is just cause of distrust. Their etnmity
recommends any man wvho is its object.
These are our reasons, and those of our
friends, who agree with us.
if attributing the hard times at present
to the Independenit Treasury bill, wahich
hasno become a lato, and possibly never
may, is not putting the cart before the
horse, or to use perhaps a more elegant
figure, charging the lamb drinking bielow
with muddying the stream above, wve cotn
fess ourselves incapable of seeings things
in their true position. It is not often that
the consequence precedes the cause, hut
we suppose this is one of the remarkable
cases, and must he believed, if it cannot

There have been rutrours of Indians
North of us, near the head of North River;
and as tracks have been seen, there is little
probability but that the report is well foun

On the Eabtern bank of the St. Johns river,

space, there are several large sugar and
cotton plantations, a large amount of slaves

which are strong inducements to the enemy.
Within this area, there is. no military pro
tection whatever; and the chain of poets,
thus far, havd proved inadequate to keep
the enemy without them. We would
again suggest the necessity of a close ex
amintion of this section of the country, for,
prophetic as it may appear, we are satis

place and is kept uput a short time will

Important from Campeachy.- By the

cial house in this city. They state that a
divisiou of one thousand men had left the
city of Compeachy, with a view to give
battle to the Federalists in the vicittity of
Merida, the capital of that State. The
moment the division cane in sight of the
soldiers of the Central Army, they aban
doned their officers, nind went over to the
Federal party. The commander of the
Centralists with his staff returned to Cam
peachy without a single soldier in their
company. Canpeachy is now left with- I
out any garrison, save the picket guard I
tint was left when the army went out. In
the whole place, there were only fifly sol

Commodore David Deacon, of the U.S.~
(avy, died on the morning of~ the 22d1 uit,
it his re-dence in Burlingtnn.
We have nut a sin Ie doubt in our minds,
hat the party opposed to the prese t ad
tinistrahion of the General Goverement,
will generally, be the warn and zealous
idvocates of the. assumitin of the state
Jebis by tie public treasury, in order thut
i public ilebt, which is considered by iliat
)arty as a public blessing, should be'crea
:ed. The arguments advanced by Mr.
,alhoun against the plan in question, and
lie reasoning of the committee of the
Senate, showing the dangerof the assump
ma of the State debts by the Federal Gov
trnment, are so sound and unanswerable,
hat it would be presumption in us to add
tur own opinion to -those so ably express
-d. But we must be permtitted to remark,
hat no plan can be adopted, as the one
tmder consideration, which is better calcu
ated, as the Whigs believe, to place the
3ouih completely at the mercy of those
h'ib nre in favor of a protective tariff.-.
rhe fact is, to carry on the government,
imd to meet the public expenses, resort
rinust be hadto loans, or to a large reduc
ion in the.public expenditures and appro
>riatlions by Congress. If, under present
irciimstances, the revenue cannot he
ufficient to meet the demandsonthe pub
ic Treasury, much less will be the reve
ue, when it i6 curtailed of the proceeds
f t he sales of the public lands, or much
ess will the revenue be, when the public
'reasury will have to meet the inerests -
n the State debts assumed by the Federal
;overnment, and to create a sinking fund
'ir the exiiti"u ishme'ht of the principal of
ie Stae dehts. so assumed.
Could the Whigs succeed in their de
ign of assuming the debts of the States, a
igh tariff will inevitably follow; the Fed
ral Government will undertake a system
f internal improvement. by creating a
ational bank, which will become of abso
ite niecassity, t) assist in carrying on those
xtensive and extraordinary undertakings.
ly the accomplishment of these plans, the
late governments will be tinder the con
-ol of the Federal government, and ihe
Vhigs, if in power, will be able te govern
te country with an absolute sway. and
) maintain themselves in power, until a
evolution drives them from it. The sub
-et is well worthy the attention of every
itizen.-Augusta Constitutionalist.
"I hare no respect for his opinions, past,
resent, or to come."-Such was the. ]an
unge used on a recent occasion by Henry
'lay to John C. Calhoun,.on the floor of
ie Senate. Mr. Clay has ever taken
casion to ridicule, and to treat with con
eimpt, the opinions of the Carolina Sena
)r; lie has before taunted him upon the
uhiject of nullification, saying that, by his
omipromise act, he saved him from the
allows, &c. Upon this last occasion, he
poke with scorn of the Senator's "past"
pinions. Yet strange-passingly strange
-Mr. Clay was the idol of Whig nullifiers
ir the Presidency. His claims I ere urged
ith enthusiastn, and universal regret was
xpressed upon his "honorable discharge "
Ve ask such nullifiets to reflect again
pon this last disrespeet for their peculiar
pinions; it was avowed when the door
f promotion had been closed;-it came as
te sincero sentiment of his mind. But
is is not the only strange occurrence in
ic political history of nullifving Whigs.
'hotigh at first they imprecated the Hiar
isburg nomtination, they cow pull together
ke well-broken lhnrses in the car of Fed
ralisin. They are supporting a man who
rill carry out measures in direct opposi
ion to their imerests, andl violative of every
rinciple heretofore so warmly cherished.

Editorial Egotism.-An editor should
