Tueskay July o 1*4 J.
The Anniversary of our National Independence
was celebrated yesterday with
the usual demim^rnfinns of joy; hat wo
are pleased to say, not with the wonted
demonstrations of attachment to that
most unscrupulous an J cruel of aU tyrants,
King Alcohol.
The assemblage to hear the oration
was large and respectable. It tilled the
spacious and commodious church of the
Baptist congregation. The Declaration
of Independence was well read by Capt.
B. F. Pkguks, and the oration by Mr.
l. b. r rince, was able and eloquent, and
breathed a spirit of enlightened and most
ardent patriotism.
It will he seea from the notice of the
Intendunt, in another column, that a
in?%elir?tr is to be helil next Saturday at
Ij I*. M. (and not '6 A. M. as ?>tir printer
made the Intnndant say last week) to reconsider
the Hog Law. lings are allowed
to run in the streets of -Y'VV YorJ\ and
Philadelphia without interruption from
the corporate authorities, and for aught
we know to the cpntpify, in all other
cities. Wfyy tl?en exclude theiji from the j
streets of a little village, even if the
Judges lujyp said it ir\qij he done?

which was decided hy the General Assent- i

ting the tariff before the 1st of July when
the law of H33 would go into fad ope- ;
ration and reduce aii imposts to 23 per
cent, passed a hill continuing the revenue j
laws till the tirst of Augi}*!, a*they were ;
qii the rirst of June, and postponing til!
the first of August the distribution of the
? I
proceeds of the public lands, which nc- I
cording to the distribution act was to take ;
place r?n the first of July. The bill was j
returned by the President to the House
where it originated, rm the 29:h June,
with his reasons for not signing it.
The reasons assigned hy him are 1 : ;
that the hill violates the compromise of j
1833, by postponing the time of its going |
into full operation for (ho space of one.
month; and 2 i ill it instead of letting the
distribution act remain inoperative according
to its own provisions, when a
tariff of more th in 20 per cent is laid on j
some articles, it provides for only sus- I
pending that act for a month, with the
view of nfterwa?\!s giving it effect when
imposts of more than 2'J per cent will he
necessary.
On the motion to print the message a
debate arose which lasted till the hour oi
adjournment, when Che motion prevailed,
van. con. Messrs. \V. C. Johnson, Gran
gor, Saltimst.ill, and Fillmore allocked
the message, and Messrs. Holmes and
Cashing deft'tided it.

(nil (reft rod to above, as returned by the
President to the House,) the lul's niakitm
appropriations for the nrmv and navy,
and a hill to make indemnity for French
spoliations before 1801.
The Hon. Samuel L. South ahi?. of
the U. S. Senate, died at Fredericksburg,
Vn., on the 26th June; and the lion.
Win. S. Hastings, member of the House
of Representatives from Massachusetts,
died at the Virginia Springs, on the
17th.
The mvddkning influence of violent
party spirit is signally exemplifled
in the following resolutions adopted
by the House of Representatives of New
Hampshire, by a vote of, 6J to 53 ; the
Dcmocrots voting for them, and the
Whig s against them.
Resolved, That according to iho theory
ot the American system of polities, the
sovereign power of a state is vested in the
people, who have the right to alter,
amend, or reconstruct their forms of gov.
eminent. whenever and in such manner
as Ihev choose, there being no rightful
human authority above them to judge ol
their acts or to control their will.
Rcsolred, That the people of Rhode Is.
land in their late attempt to reform their
government bv the establishment ol a
ire? constitution exercised the right ot
sovereignty legitimately ; that the con.
stitulion they framed and the government
they established is the legitimate constij
tution and government of that state, and
that the act of the people of that state by
which they framed a new constitution and
government, abrogated and annulled the
old charter of King Charles the 2d, and
rendered nil arts done under said charter
void ar?d of no effect.
Rrsolced, That neither the General
Government nor any of its departments
have a right to interfere in any political
controvert Uetwcpn different portions of
the people of h state m which the question
of sovereignty i? in issue ; and tnat John
Tyler, the acting President of the United
States, by interfering with ana deciding
the question of so\?ereignty pending between
the t*o parties in it. I. has been
I guilty of a wanfon and flagrant act <
usurpation, for which ho deserves in
peachment end expulsion from office.
Resolved, That ill the name of the d<
mocracy of New II amp^liirc, we tench
the constitutionalists ol It node Island 01
sympathy and encouragement, and u
| conjure them never to surrender n can.j
so just and sacred, involving, as wo hr
j lieve, the great fundamental principles <
American liherty, hut exhort them to pel
severe in all proper means, to -return
: their rights, and if an appeal he necessan
j in the last resort, to the (?\>d of Justici
we trust their hearts will he nerved t
i meet the crisis with the firmness and in
j trepidity of men resolved to perish or h
J free, remembering "thrice is he anno
| who has his quarrel just," and that friend
j will rise up on every side to succor th
oppressed.
The Senate were evpectcd to pass thes<
; resolutions in like manner; that is by i
! party vote. It "John Tvlor, acting IVe.si
J dent of the United Slates*' had espouse*
> the cause of the insurgents in Rhode Is
! n
| land Ciov. Hubbard and his party in Nov
Hampshire would doubtless have beci
j equally severe upon him, and with mon
|reason.
The IJou.se of Representatives of New
Hampshire also resolved on the 21st June
| that it would pass no hill dividing th<
I State into districts for the election of rep
resentatives to Congress. If the appor
1 ** 1 L' il I _
t eminent Dill passed oy ooiu nouses o
Congress requiring representatives to ht
chosen in the states by districts, should !.<
approved by the President and become i
law,* and the Legislatures of any of tin
States should fail or refuse to pass a lav
dividing the state into districts, it wil
then, of course, he incumbent on Con
gross to make such division. If, in (In
mean time, the people in any of the State:
should, under their local lavs, elect 1m
general ticket the number of represents
lives to which they arc entitled, what wil
he the result ? Can Congress rightful!)
take advantage of its own neglect, or it;
own wrong, to exclude the chosen reprc
sentaiives of a state when these reprcsen
tatives are chosen according to the onlv
laws bv which they could ho chos.in ??
The following is the provision of the con
siitutiono i the subj *et:
The times, places and manner of hold
ing elections for Senators and Represcn
tatives shall bo pi escribed in each Stab
l?V the Legislature thereof ; but the Con
i J O
U.. I~...
yross mav ?ii any ii.'hk, ?>y kh?, iu.ihg w(
' altersiirIi regulations, except as to the
place of choosing Senators.
Now Congress has no power lo require
a state lo legi.-late on any subject. The
1 constitution contains no such anomaly ai
the grant of a power which, from (he von
; nature of the case, cannot be enforced
i \ Slate; Legislature may or may not, a
| its option, co-operate with Congress in it
i legislation on this or any other subject
| Although Congress may at any tinv
, "alter" the "regulations" prescribed in tin
j States by theii Legislatures for the e!cc
I lion of representatives', has it power so t
alter them asto defeat or prevent an dec
tion altogether? Surely not. No law
whether constitution or .statute, is to b
; so interpreted as to defeat the intention n
I the law manifest on its face. The plaii
j intention of the clause of the constilutioi
before us to secure a representation ii
i Congress ; am! it cannot be so interprde
! as to prevent this cnil. When a stat
Legislature has "prescribed" that the reji
rcsentatives of the S ate to Congre>
shall he chosen by districts, without fixin
tlie limits of these districts, is this such a
alteration of the "regulations" of the: Stat
Legislature as is contemplated, by t!i
i constitution? We think not. Until Co;:
gross does something more, the state la<
is the constitutional law ; for it is the or
ly. law under which representatives ca
t)o chosen ; and the representatives chv
sen under it have as much right to the
seats in Congress as any others. Th
1 llouso cannot exclude tlieni without
gross usurpation of power.
Men and editors may talk and write z
harshly as they will of New Humps!.ii
j or Georgia, or any other State for d<
! dining or refusing to legislate in ohed
~ O O
cnce to the wili of Congress on this <
any other subject, hut that cannot altc
the case. They may call it nuJlijlcaik
as some of them do, hut it is a loose u>
of language. The political meaning <
the term nullification is something moi
than a mere refusal of a Slate Legisl;
ture to enact laws in obedience to a mat
J date of the Federal authorities.
Wc do not approve the course of Nc
j Hampshire, or any other State, in r
1 fusing, from more spite, to divide its te
| ritory into dish ids, and save Congrc
i the trouble of doing so. We have r
i doubt that thev would do it themselvi
. j #
! more to their own satisfaction than Coi
j gress can. \i?t they have a right to r<
j fuse, and we think it the duty of ever

Washington. June *Jd.
The country will soon be enabled to c?>u- j
gratulate itself on the complete and satisuo- j
lory adjus.nieut of all pending dtilicuiUes with i
England. The negotiations between Mr.)'
Webster anij l.ord Ashbnrtoir are drawing
to a close, and the most difficult and comp i. | 1
catedof all the questions?that of the North i'
Eastern boundary?lias already been settled
to the entire satisfaction of the Commissioners
of the Stales of Maine a\J Massachusetts.
The administration will be surely allowed
so ue cred t for this happy result.
There never was a moment of more tine rtain'y
and interest in publics than the present. J
It is evident that the friends of Mr. Cl .y are J
pressing his claims with more ardor and f
unanimity than was expected. In addition to 1
they wero addressed by sundry orators, i ne
meeting is repres niod by some of the WVg
papers as being more enthusiastic than even

EFFECTS OF TEMPERANCE* '
A frreat sale of Wine took plncc in (
Philadelphia on Wednesday. In order
to show the inil icncc of the times, or of |
the Temperance societies, wc annex the.
price at which the same vsinea sold by the ! 1
cask at a previous sale. Sherry Wines J
which in November last brought aw.wn
per gallon, sold for $1,00 a $1.'20; $0 00
in Nov. now $1,1$. A lot nt $3.00 in
November, now $2,30 ; .Madeira $3 00,
now sold at $'2 73 per gallon ; Amtilla do.
$18,000 [KJf dozen sold lor $0,25; Ma- j
dciia selected from London Docks in j
1330, which co-jt at (he time of bottling!
$10 per gallon sold at $3,00. S.tmey in j
bottles brought $1Q per dozen; another:
lot same ago as the Inst brought $3/25 per
gallon and $13,50 per dozen.
The above shows an average fall in
price of more than fifty per cent in little
more than six months. As it is known,
says a Philadelphia paper, that the currency
has not depreciated in any thing
like that ratio, the cause of the great falling
oIT must he attributed to the feeling
and spirit of tenrporancc that at present
unri'a.icc nil rlns-iCS of society. I he j
tiie cabinet. i>o onu u mui. j
change would occur in I lie C-ibine*, except;
in ilie event of Mr. Webster's resignation !
from private consideration*, or in the event of
a veto of the revenue bill. One thing is cer. i
tain that the Whig party in Congress is now i
more united and resoiu c than ever; and that j
the President will find it exceedingly difficult J
to oppose them. The government cannot go t
"it, if the pxpoeted collision should take place, j
It is therefore rumored, and the MaJisonian
of this morning intimates, that the 1'refiident ;
will find it hi* duty to the country, however
unpleasant to himself, to 6 gn a revenue bd. I
allowing of distribution. ?
Some members are of hie opinion thai '
Congress cannot adjourn for a Jong tune? '
for the reason that there is no prospect of'
getting any money, either by Joan or other.!
wise, to carry on the government. But a !
prolonged session will only aggravate the evil, j
; Congress ought to decide at once, if ever, j
{ whether a revenue biif ta to pa-?. i nu unI

The Gkey Ass.?A tavern keeper in c
G right mi was doing a thriving business on
the Bristol road under the sign of "tin
Donkey," and his house had become
noted for its good eating and liberal cheer.
At the time of the great popularl y o!
the Duke of Wellington, be had the ?
Jon key taken down, and a fine portrait
*t full length, of his grace, substituted. (
A rival innkeeper of the village seeing his
srror. had the old sign'purchased, and
transferred the "grey ass," to a place |
over his ow n door. To the chagrin and
disappointment of tho original ow ner, he ]
saw ihe sign carrying all his old custom |<
with it. To remedy the evil, he had l1
painted in large letters directly under the '
Juke's portrait, " This is the original grey j
