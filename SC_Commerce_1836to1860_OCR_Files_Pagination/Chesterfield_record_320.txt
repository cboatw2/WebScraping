Cultivation of Cotton.
ll?portoa the Cultivation of Cotton, road bufors
the Poa Djo Agricultural Society at its Soini.
annual mooting in October 1839, by tho
lion. John Campbell.
The first object of consideration in the |
cultivation of cotton is the soleeiion of a soil j
f .stiited to its production. Uut as every va* i
riciy of soil within the li nits of the Poo D??o
conn'ry of sufficient fertility, is foutui under i
a judicious system of eultivitjjita^gdBgji^fl u i
j*'k?d return for the labor bcatotraflKHM if, |
und as u co.nmiitoc has been nq|||M by <
this society to report particularly jfyfkbn ina- |
mires, it is thought unnecessary to ntuko any
comment upon this branch of tho subject;
except to remark* that from nn exhausted i
soil, or one naturally poor* and unimproved i
by ui t, it Ls?vuin for tho planter ovoti with i
ttio mostAgorublc seasons, to expect an i
abundant nKh'est. i
The field being selected end the proper
season having arrived, the first operation is
to prepare it for planting.
in pro;i9^kK|>rep:iriiig land for planting
.short staple cotton good ploughing is indispensable,
and among tlm rules which may
Lie i iid down as admitting of no modification,
are these : livery part ot the sod should
be turned and eficciu dly pulverized ; and
the depth of furrow on nil lands should bu
regulated hy tho stratum which divides
the fertile from the unfertile moulds. Therefore,
in the breilting up or preparation of
land, the plough nmj go ns deep as the soil
will admit, but not deeper, und from the
violation of t lis rule which nature lias provided
us a chlerion, thin suds arc sometimes
much injured.
.1 <ight und dry mould*that are easily pulvnrizid
may be ploughed immediately
before planting. flut on clayey so Is, where
the extremes of wot and dry present the
the disagreeable ulieruatives of miro or
clods, the best season of ploughing is often
u'uJ critical, an I such i.nh <ih..nlri
when practicable be ploughed early in lh? ! i
winter, that they may by tins nc ton of the i
trust be rendered triable and more easy of t
%. culiivnt on. <
The usual nnJ tv-st method of plunting I
cotton is on ridges, |!??? cent os of which '
vary in distance from three an?l a half to snv <
en foot, in proportion as the soil is more or
lcaH fertile. The ridges boing widest upon I
the more fertile so Is. whoro Irom th? larger i
siz-i to which this plant attains, it requires '
tho greater distance to admit tho influence
of the sun and tho circulation of (ho air.?WPo
n all sods the observance of this rule is
important, hut particularly up n suchasaro
backward in bringing col on to maturity.
Tlio ridgos are formed according to circumstances
cither by tho pluugii ulono
drawn by one or mora horses, or by tho
plough and hot*.
The land being thus prepared, the object 1
IS to p'ufit. i
Cotton being pi<>Jiicod in nil the Soothem
ari l Snu'.hu ..?st :rn States, over a tcrri'ory
embracing a considerable variety ofcli- 1
mate, is piu jtciJ at u-Keren! times from the 11
middle of March to the firs: of May. Ah a 1
universal rule however, it may be rwnnrked,
tout the planter should select the cnrli st 1
pcrioJ that is consistent with safely. Con- 1
ti'lent that let human systems vary ns they 1
may, the approach of that season which 1
wakes up tho vegetable creation from tho
sleep of winter, mi l by its genial inflj -nce 1
gives it lifo ami beauty, is regulated by a 1
steady hand?and grateful wlien lie coinmi s
his seed to the earth, that if he has discharged '
his duty in propating Ins land for their re.
caption, his labor will n*t ho in vain. In
tho region embraced by the I'oo L).*e Agricultural
Society, the best time for planting
is during the inon'h of April, commencing
at>out the second week and co nploiing tho
operation as soon u'ircwanls as practicable. ,
It rarely, indeed it almost} never, occurs,
where lands huve lus-n well prepared, tint
there is n failure in the; s'nml.
The seed are planted either in drills, in
. checks or in chops. Hut the most usual
mm-I convenient nv? hod when mod nre
nbundan', is t(? sow in drills run on the tops
of the ridges and to cover lightly with a
plough cons: rue ted for the purpose. If the
weather is moist and warm the plant will
eppear 1:1 a few days, if tin contrary Clio
seed will remain for weeks without vegetating.
The stand of co'ton is sometimes
injured by heavy floods of rain falling shortly

ingn crust on tlio drill which the vegetating
seed are unable to penetrate. Light soils
?ro not subject to this evil, and on stilf lands

I was somewhat surprised to find in a

writer, under the title of Emigration, would
prevent the evil by the very menus, which
1 will endeavor to show, will invariably proJueo
it. It lias been the too fatal pructice

acres of cotton, and eight of corn, potn o?s,

It is tho system of planting largely to the

fc-rtjiiiy it imparled to the soil, ie
place of increasing. barrenness and decay,
pud. the ever connoting reflection to the
planter that he at least will not be compelled
to?<'migrate....
1 am fully convinced that the system of
heavy planting i* extremely injurious t>? the
beafinu-reets of the planter, and of the Stain,
and 1 would gpntly rejoice to ace every

clear of grata?tojPn at k-nst one half of
1 Hrhc cotton lands retting every ye?r, qqJ inaOUtrp

Another cause nf our wojM^of success is
in th" employment of oversoers. I do not
wish to bo understood us iiiinr a worJ
against that iu<lu?tr<ou* nnd useful data of
meu. but wiiai I do innon is. that 110 planter
can be entirely successful who places |!<e
whole management of hit estate in tho hands
of another.
I will state th? overseer system, simply
sad plain y. Admit that a planter employs
a go?>d overser. who conducts h*s busin-as
generally, well enough, (always denying.
However, that the overseer can conduct it
better than tl?e employer, if ho has any good
habits of business.) Under such an overseer,
the plantation may be put and kept in
good condition, but the usual result is that
the overseer d. mands an increase of wages
at tho expiration of each year, until at
length the employer will give him no more,
and he seeks employment elsewhere. The
planter gets another?-a ba.t one?the chan*****
are aeainsi him, fni Iuiditl*?reni or bad
overseers are inore numerous titan goon
ones.) Th?* plantation become* unprofitable
under his managemem?he in turn is replaced
by another, and after a course of
years, under good, indifferent, and bad overs-era,
the owner abandons a fine climate,
and perhaps a fruitful soil, ill the vain hope
of finding elsewhere a country where his
labors will be rewarded ; but vain will be
his hope * if ho continues always to trust
entirely to another, what he ought in greet
part to du himself.
h is a grout but too common error of most
persons to suppose that any fool can muko
s good planter. Parents have often been
heard to say?will givo my son a plain
English Education?enough for a planter.?*
Givo him enongh for a lawyer?a physician?a
divine?acquaint htm, if you can,
with all aria and studies," and he will make,
I assure you, no worse planter for his learn
mg. The prevailing error that eduenhoa
it not necessary to the planter is a ffr*>nt
muse of failure among ihut class of men.
I am aware of no pursuit that requires mora
continual observation anJ reflection than
agriculture ; and 1 think that no one is likely
o be a v? ry successfu planter, unless he
so considers it. 'Agriculture,' say* Mar liul,
as quoted in ihu Into able wd<lr???? to
the planters and farmers of South Carolina,
"is a subject which viewed in all its branch,
es, and 10 their fullest ex'ent, is nor only the
most difficult in the rural economies, hut in
the circle of human arts and science."
How then can the plana r l?e successful
who follows no fix- d plan himself, and entrusts
the management of his entire estnta
to the ever vniying plans of his ngen s.
whom he changes with almost every year?
Let nie advise ouch one 10 follow somesys.
tem?an erroneous one is better than none
at ail. Never cuit-vnte more than his force
is able to tend m any season, however ad

You nronwore however, that by placing nn j

There evidently is no fancy in the affair to ! (
the man who holds the handles and guides j
jh? t*uini. There is however, ample room j (
for the exercise of much practical good ?i
sense in poncing out the bo?t r.-.ihod of 1
breeding, raising, breaking nnd working1
furming horses to the best advantage. The j
profits of agricultural operution generally!
uro moderate, and managed as ;h?*y nn' in J
many instances loss is incurred. Most I
breeders of animals, it is apprehended, ro.
ceivu but a very inadequate comptnsul on
for their time and attenlion and money ex- I
psndtd. It ought not to be. and that it is
does not result necessarily, but from live '
want of proper care and judgment in breed- j
ing oud raising. They follow what has j
be> n.uol inaptly coiled lio hup-hazard mode, !
by putting any sort of a female to any sort i
of u mule wihout regard to qualities ; und I
in raising tiiey are so stinted und starved ns i
to warp and dcslioy whatever liitlu of good !
form sod cons'itution, they amy have occi- j
iltinliy brought into tho world with them.
These seem to act without obj??oi, except,
that they know a horse is a horse and a
steer a steer, and that if iho colt was got for
a barrel of corn and the calf gratis, that they
havo saved their money.
The business of breeding animals, in modern
times, is sa d to be science. It has
not been, howev r, and prolmbly never will
be reduced to exactness. * Dame nature*'
in her ojverations delights to disnluv endless i
variolic*. But certain Yules have been laid
down by the observance of which we may
reasonably expect to approximate c-rtuinty.
* Like begets like" is the leading rule. It
not only has its exceptions, hut it must be
understood with limitation. Select a horse

It should be enjoined on beginners, there lore,
1st, To s'-h-ct good animals to start upon,
where no beitereviduncc cut) be hnd : 2ndly,
But where it can. to select tliem from good
families. In England, where more a tontion
lias been paid to the breeding and rear,
inil the blood horse, than in nnv other conn- i
irv, lin y have arrived at extraordinary siX'*,

and developing thu bone and muscle of
(ho new race by generous feed and judicious /
ex?*rci?e, There no one thinks of breeding I
a ruc- r from a mare wlvo lias not at h ast
five pure crosses. And many of their most
distinguished marcs can number double the
amount, ! Hiding on a royul, or oilier Arab,
i'lii or B irb mare. There is nomcthi.ijg in
the blood, thut gives family distinction,
though ilio blood may not tell in pnnieular
individuals, either from mismanagement or
Occident, or Irom gome detect in constitution
or torm. A third rule requires that tliey
bo crossed ; in other woids, that wo avoid
the coupl ng togctle r near relatives. The
more remote tlin families, probably the bi tter
; but nf.er prohibiting liie intercourse of
sire and daughter, brother and sifter, be
yond these we may probably be pcrmi ted
to use our judgment in selecting the reaui
sito forms. Horn* of (lie double Januw**

very amnl!. The double Arcliys evidently
show h fulling off. Hut Wagner by Sir
Charles out of a Marion is thought to be
among the good ones. And we need not
look for a better than Highflyer, his darn

Draught horses, perhaps equal to. any,

T lie rork should all be selected by it coml>ctimt
ju fgo of liorse flesh, and tho two
coarser kinds sIhhiUJ be chosen not only
with s view to thcirown s'outness,but fumily
stoutness und gentleness et work, and
with a scrutinizing eye to their hoofii and
pasterns. Brittle horn, gummy ankles, or
tendency to grease in tho heals should be
an insurmountable objection to a horse
however perfect in other respects. W#
would of course have to chooso the temper
of the I) whs and Turks, though a man
inorougiity conversant with horses can
certain indications form a tolerably correct
nilmuit: of their icnijiiir*. A pvrtuii inn
moderately acquainted would be able to
know that BeUhazjtur was quiet, and that
St. Giles was M queer." The mnrea to be
selected, should be well bred, of bay or
brown colour nod a few greys. They
should have long heads, wide between tho
eyes, and jaws well displayed, with clear
p'.icid eyes, and open foreheads, with pointed,
w. ii set cars, ana nu&muezics, and nostrils ;
necks of moderate length and muscular,
with large detached windpipes; having
quarters before and behind with plenty of
muscle ; large bodies with forge ribs, and
the short ribs eloso to tlte hips ; standing
even and rather wide on legs abounding ill
!>one nnd sinew, and terminated by tough
l?hek hoofs. A white pastern and hnof is
about as liable to disease as those of btac|t
or dark chrsnut colour. Tho Stations
should be of similar shape, but more coarse*
ncss is tolerable in tbein, particularly about
the n?-ek. The mares above described of
$15 1-2 hands high or upwards should be put
to the Barb and Turk, those under, to the
Cleavelund buy. Those three crosses In
