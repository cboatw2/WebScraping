PROCEEDINGS OF THE CONVENTION
OF DELEGATES FROM THE SOUTH.
ERN AND SOUTH WESTERN CON
TERENCES.
Tenth Day.
Monday, May 12.
The convention met pursuant to adjournment,
Bishop Andrew in the chair.
Dr. L. Pierce opened with the usual religious
services.
The journal of Saturday was read.
Mr. Brock, of the Memphis conference, pre
sented the following memorial from the mayor
of Memphis, Tennessee, which wag read and
laid on the table for the present, viz:
At a meeting of the mayor and board of alder
men of the town of Memphis, held at the City
Hall, May, 5, 1845, the following resolutions
were adopted : Be it
Resolved, By the mayor and aldermen ot the
town of Memphis, that they look with great in
terest to the establishment of the Methodist book
concern in the South, and that they esteem it a
privilege and a duty to contribute to the extent
of their ability to secure its location in this city.
Resolved, That this board, believing the City
Hotel in this city (which cost about thirty thou
sand dollars) to be a suitable building for said
book establishment, and believing that said pro
perty will be purchased by individual subscrip
tions and such appropriations as the corporation
will make for the purpose, and donate to the
Methodist church, if said book concern is loca
ted here. Be it therefore,
Resolved, That the corporation of Memphis
will make a liberal donation for the purchase of
said City Hotel property, or any other site which
may be preferred or thought to be more eligible,
provided the said book concern be located at this
place.
J. J. Finley, Mayor.
O. D. Watson, Recorder.
On motion of Mr. T. C. Benning, of Florida
conference, and E. Stevenson, of Kentucky, a
f committee on book concerns was appointed.
On motion of Mr. Harris the memorial from
the mayor of Memphis, together with the ac
companying resolutions, were referred to the
committee on the book concern.
Mr. McFerrin presented a memorial from the
quarterly conference of the Brook street charge,
Louisville district, asking the location of the
book concern to be in this city, which was read
and referred to the same committee.
The resolution offered by Drs. Smith and
Pierce was then called up, and Dr. Paine, of
Tennessee, addressed the audience.
Dr. Paine remarked in rising, that he wished
to present to the consideration of the convention
a few remarks connected with the great emer
gency which called them together. He held a
relation to this subject which enabled him to
know much of the causes which led to the pre
sent posture of affairs, having been chairman of
the committee in the late general conference
which prepared the report on the subject of sep
aration. He entered into a brief history of the
origin and progress of the difficulties of the
church on theaubject of slavery, stating what the
true position of the South is at present. He
maintained that separation was the best and only
means of meeting an emergency, which, how
ever the cause* leading to it might be deplored,
had nevertheless to be met in the right temper.
A necessity was undeniably found to exist on
both sides, both North and South. He review
ed graphically the efforts made at the general
conference of 1844, by both parties, to compro
mise the difficulty. The result was a failure,
which left the practicability of compromise in
hopeless despair. He proceeded to vindicate
the character of this movement from the impu
tations of schism and secession. He declared
that the separation which the South contemplates
could not be regarded as a schism or secession,
I either in $ theological or popular sense. He
quoted from I. Cor., 1; 10, to show that schism
was a movement in a church, disturbing its
peace and destroying its harmony; whereas our
separation contemplates no such object, but, on
the contrary, is meant to put an end to disturban
ces already existing in tba communion, by the
establishment of a new jurisdiction which was
meant to change only the federal relations of the
annual conferences, North and South. But are
we secessionists ? Secession, according to its
radical import, is an act by which an individual
withdraws himself from the communion and
L fellowship of a church, without tha assent oi
concurrence of the church, taking upon himsel
^Bthe whole responsibility of the act. But is thai
^Wjur position t VVe do not take ourselves from
the fellowship of the great Wesleyan family, bui
by the actual consent and formal concurrence o
the general conference with a surprising una
nimity of action on the part of the majority. Ir
that action we find our magna charta. And be
side, not only a vast majority of the general con
ference, but a decided majority of the preachers
of the annual conferences, so far as they hac
been called on to act, bad given their assent anc
sanction.
He adverted to documentary evidence. Die
the South 4esire to Acede 1 Did they proclaim
any such intention eten when drive* to thfelW
extremity 1 Did their protest contemplate ae
cession ? He quoted many passages from tha
in«trnment to sustain this potion. Did the re
solution instructing the committee of nine “to de
vise a institutional plan for a mutual and
friendly division of the church,” offered by a
Southern man and seconded by n Northern, con
template anything like secession 1 Was the
new organization regarded in any such light by
the report which that committee brought in ? He
read copious extracts from speeches made by the
most prominent Northern men, when the report
was before the conference for adoption. Drs.
Luckey, Bangs, Hamline, Filmore, all of them
spoke in most decided terms on that occasion ; all
of them approved the report on the ground that
it provided for an amicable adjustment of difficul
ties in the only practicable way. And now the
North—no not the North, but the senior editor,
brands us os secedcrs I Could the South have
been induced to support the “plan of division,”
if they had understood that when the time came
to carry out in good faith the provisions of that
“plan” they were to be stigmatized as secession
ists 1 This would have been a case of Punica
fides with a vengeance. The Methodist Episco
pal Church in the United States had separated
from the jurisdiction of the Wesleyan confer
ence. Where was the secession in that case 1
Northern speakers themselves had put the pre
sent movement on precisely the same ground.
The report referred to was not indeed just what
the South wanted ; but the best the South could
get. Dr. Hamline wrotethe report, every word
of it, and he hoped he would stand up to the last
in its defence. He was confident that he (Bish
op Hamline) at least, would not wield his influ
ence against what. the committee meant to do—
would never join in the silly clamor about seces
sion. Dr. Bond had indeed opposed the plan at
the time. His difficulty was not placed on con
stitutional ground, but he considered the thing
inexpedient because it would produce difficulties
along the border. This prediction he was him
self carrying out with a vengeance. He had
foretold difficulties and strife, and had himself
done more than any one else to produce strife.
Along the whole border, where the Southern pa
pers had no circulation, he, the said senior edi
tor, had scattered “fire brands, arrows and death."
Nay, he had dared to pronounce the solemn act
of the general conference a nullity, while he
was eating the b^ad of the genera! conference,
I
I
?uu vu m-fcuo us agem uiiu oinccr I-*—
a subordinate bound to carry out the honorable
pledge and intentions of that body, and at the
same time waging war against their expressed
wishes and designs I Bond ought to be impeach
ed. He had arraigned Bishop Soule for invi
ting Bishop Andrew to assist him in visiting the
Southern conferences, where the Utter was most
acceptable; while he (Bond) with high-handed
arrogance undertook to nullify the whole plan
of the general conference. He (Dr. Paine)
would tell Bond, and the brethren of the North,
that if they could not have a peaceable separa
tion, they would have separation anyhow, and
separation, too, on the very plan of the commit
tee ofnine, whether that plan was called a nulli
ty, or we were branded as seceders or not. The
editor’s policy evidently was—divide and con
quer. The security against his machinations is
to be found in the good common sense and piety
of the people. Thus it is seen that neither the
protest, nor the declaration, nor the resolution of
instruction, nor the report of the committee of
nine, contemplated a secession. He enlarged
upon the absurdity of the provisions made in the
report, if we were to be considered seceders.
Was the like ever seen in the world before, that
the legislature of a church set itself gravely and
earnestly to make special arrangements and ad
vantageous provisions, both ecclesiastical and pe
cuniary, for a set of seceders 1 And although
the constitutional vote by which the property
might be divided, had not been given by the an
nual conferences, yet he ventured to predict, with
confidence that we should yet obtain every dollar
of our property. There was justice and mag
nanimity enough in the North to secure to us our
pecuniary rights. When the existing excite
ment had passed away, and the still small voice
of conscience should be heaiA he, for one, be
lieved that the North would IS us have our equi
table claims upon the common property. They
would do it from principle. If not, public senti
ment would compel them.
He proceeded to notice some objections. It
' had been alledgedthat we should be a pro-slave
ry church. But (how stood the facts? The
South was satisfied w ith the book of discipline
as it is. The North were not satisfied, and had
made an aggression on established compromises.
We resist those aggressions. How does this
make us pro-slavery ?' They invaded the prin
ciple of equal rights and privileges, North and
South. We maintain that the South has no
right to relinquish the ground of equal privileges
and prerogatives. Their action had always
proscribed the South by the omnipotence of the
ballot-box; but the principle had never been
avowed before. Now proscription was avowed
and declared to be the policy of the church, and
to this the South could not and would not submit.
To do so, would be to give up at once the Meth
odist Episcopal Church in the slaveholding
States.
i ne met was we had the same constitution, the
same organic principles, the same doctrines, as
ever. This was no new form of Methodism,
We had the old usages, forms, and ceremonies ;
the old preachers, some of the old bishops, and
the old unalterable principles of Christianity,
Under the out-gushing impulses of the old spir
it, as soon as our contemplated organization was
completed, we should go forth, every man ani
mated with unconquerable zeal, to spread the old
scriptural holiness over the land. However ii
might be with the Northern church, he held
that the Southern church would be true to the
grand, original, sole design of Methodistic or
ganization—universal love to God and man
spiritual, religious ends and purposes, unmixec
with political designs, unwarped by secular ten
dencies. Let the history of the early churcl
teach the world the danger of large ecclesiasti
cal bodies interfering with civil relations and po
litical ends. The gospel of Jesus Christ con
templated no such purposes. He warned Nor
them and Western brethren, if any such wert
here, that we intended to bring Methodism bad
to its original, spiritual ends and designs. Or
this subject, we intended to live and die by th<
doctrines of the “Protest."
It is said that this movement would product
dissensions and strife. The resolutions of South
•rn meetings had been blamed as intemperate
i He dii not mean to say that,-, under a sense o
injury, the South had not occasionally said strong
things. But had not Northern editors and wn
' ters far exceeded every hard thing which tb<
South hud said ? Personal vituperation had
been unsparingly employed by them. They
made everything personal. How had the no
ble champion of Southern rights been treated by
Dr. Bond? As he (Dr. P.) saw that his friend
Dr. Bascom was not in the house, he would
speak more freely. A man, honored universal
ly by his Southern brethren for his talents, vir
tues, and most valuable services, had been made
the shining mark for Bond’s envenomed shafts.
Dr. Bond talks of radicalism I He had surely
forgotten his own radicalism I It could be prov
ed that his name stands appended to a petition to
the general conference of 1824 for lay delega
tion. To be sure, he was converted over to the
right side before the final catastrophe came. Yet,
if report speak truly, n * was won over by a quid
pro quo consideration. Is he the person to taunt
Dr. Bascom with former opinions ?
After disposing in a summary manner, of the
allegation tnat the Southern men were ambitious
of the honors of the church, he glanced at the
objection that the present movement was unconsti
tutional. But who, he asked, was to be the judge
of the constitutionality of this thing ? The bench
of Bishops have not pronounced it unconstitution
al. The annual conferences have not The
general conferences itself had elevated to the
episcopate the very speaker who claimed for it (
all power in heaven and earth, but what was |
reserved to the annual conferences in the res
trictive rules. The general conference then
claimed the power, ana exercised the power in
volved in the provisions of the plan on which we
are acting. Shall Northern editors adjudicate
this matter? Preposterous idea—presumption
indescribable 1 The fact was, Methodism claim
ed, and did actually possess a self-adjusting ener
gy. It adapted its economical rules and jurisdic
tional principles to the world ns it found it. It
existed in monarchical governments, it was found
in republics, it made its lodgement in the West
Indies, in the East Indies, in every latitude, in
every zone; and everywhere it was the conser
vator of existing law, of order, of public peace.
It is no friend of discord—O’Connellizing the
masses of society, but it goes forth to soothe the
sorrows it cannot prevent ; to alleviate the bur
dens it cannot remove ; to gild the dying hours
I of the poor sufferer in life’s pilgrimage, and
[ point the dying eye to the glories of immortality.
Dr. Paine sot down amidst loud cheerings from
every part of the assembly.
1 he bishop appointed the following gentlemen
as the committee on the Southern book concern.
William Winans, E. Stevenson, M. Brock,
H. A. C. Walker, T. Crowder, Tbomas John
son.
On motion the convention adjourned.
Eleventh Day.
Tuesday, May 13.
The convention met pursuant to adjournment,
Bishop Andrew in the chair.
The religious services were conducted by Mr.
| Johnson of the Missouri conference.
The president called for memorials and re
ports of committees; no response.
The resolution offered by Drs. Smith and
Pierce, on a former occasion, was then called up,
and Mr. Crowder, of the Virginia conference,
rose and said:
He spoke under great embarrassment. He
was aware that the ground hnd been occupied in :
the able speeches which had preceded. Never- j
theless he felt it to be his duty to set forth his j
views on the subject which has agitated the
church throughout the length and breadth of the ;
land. His object Was to show that the purpose
of the discipline to extirpate the great evil of sla
very could not be carried out by the course ofthe
Abolitionists. He was free to acknowledge,
with his brother from S. Carolina, (Mr. Dun
woody,) that slavery under some circumstances
was an evil; yet he had properly said that un
der other circumstances it was not an evil. In
deed, the Bible did not condemn slavery as a sin,
as it now exists among us. St. Paul has classed
kidnappers with the most flagrant offenders; and
it was in view of this principle that the general
rule inhibiting the buying and selling of men,
women, and children with the intention of enslav
ing them, was introduced into the discipline.
Upon this ground he was determined to stand
forever ; and he was persuaded that in this sen
timent every member of the convention concur
red with him. This principle (kidnapping) led,
in the first instance, to the slave trade, which is
now sought to be put down by all nations. This
is what he understood slavery to be in the ab
stract, and this is what the discipline assumes tu
be wrong, and what the gospel proposes to ex
tirpate, and Onnstiamty to destroy. Slavery in
the concrete was an evil in many particulars,
but it is a necessary evil, and therefore it cannot
be regarded as a sin. We must manage the
subject in the best possible manner. Hence our
discipline adapts itself in the regulation of this
matter, to the laws of the State; this is the ground
the Methodist Episcopal church took at the be
ginning, and this is the position which we in
tend still to maintain in the South. Mr. Crow
der proceeded with the scriptural and moral as
pects of the subject at some length ; after which
he reviewed the policy of the Abolitionists and
the late general conference. He argued the ne
cessity of a separate organization, affirming that
we intend to maintain sound Methodistic doc
trines and usages in all our movements.
Mr. Brush, of the Kentucky conference, pre
sented memorials from the Wesley Chapel and
Fourth and Eighth street stations in relation to
establishing thebook concern in the city of Louis
ville, which were referred to the committee on
the book concern. He also presented the fol
lowing memorial from a joint committee from
the several stations in Louisville, which was
read and referred:
Lousville, May 12, 1845.
Whereat, It is expected that the convention of
delegates from the Southern and Southwestern
conferences of the Methodist Episcopal Church,
now in session in this city, in carrying out the
proposed separate organization of those conferen
ces, will probably adopt incipient measures for
the establishment of a general book concern and
a principal religious newspaper at some point
‘ within the jurisdiction of the proposed organiza
tion ; therefore, the undersigned, a committee
appointed for the purpose at a meeting of the
members of the several charges of the Methodist
Episcopal church in Louiasille, held this day,
r most respectfully present for tha consideration of
the convention this memorial, setting forth the
- grounds upon which we claim that Louisville is
i the most suitable site for those establishments.
»■
1 Louisville has now a population of over thir-1
tv-five thousand inhabitants, and is rapidly in-,
creasing. Her commerce is large, flourishing,
ond steadily extending. Her manufactures are
various, important, profitable, and rapidly grow
ing in amount and variety. Hence she can af
ford a very large and increasing patronage to the
book concern, a large local subscription to the
newspaper, and a large and valuable advertis-1
ing custom.
The commerce of Louisville, is extended over i
Tennessee, Alabama, Missouri, Arkansas, Mis
sissippi, Louisiana, every portion of Kentucky, I
and a large portion of Virginia and merchants
and others from all those States visit this city re-1
gularly and frequently to purchase supplies ofi
merchandise, Western manufactures, and pro
duce, thus affording an extensive trade, already
formed, through which the publications of the
book concern could be vended to a very large
amount over districts which cannot as readily,
if at all, be reached from any other point.
Located on the Ohio river, the channel
through which passes nearly the whole internal
trade of three-fourths of the Union, at a point
where a very large amount of that trade and tra
vel is embarked or re-embarked, Louisville
certainly presents superior facilities for access
and departure to all whom business or pleasure
may call to visit her, and the book concern, lo
cated here, could distribute its publications more
generally, more promptly and expeditiously, and
much more cheaply than from any other point
within the bounds of the proposed organization.
And that we may not be considered as making
assertions that cannot be sustained, we ask indul
gence to enumerate in detail the facilities for tra
vel and transportation which Louisville now
commands.
There is an almost daily communication by
steamboats (interrupted only occasionally by ice,
an interruption which has not occurred for sever
al years) with every landing, town, and city
from Louisville to New Orleans; and, by em
bracing the facilities afforded at New Orleans,
this communication may be extended to South
Alabama, Florida, Georgia, the Carolines, and
Texas. There are regular and distinct lines of!
packet steamboats running between Louisville
and Bowling Green, at the head.of slackwater!
navigation on the Green and Barren rivers. To
Nashville Rnd all intermediate points on the
Cumberland river. To Florence and Tuscum
bia, in Alabama, and all intermediate points on
the Tennessee river. To St. Louis, Missouri,
and all points on the Upper Mississippi and Mis
souri rivers. Then, turning up the Ohio, we
have our daily packet steamers for the Kentucky
river, a regular daily line to Cincinnati, and al
most hourly departures of steamboats for Pitts
burg and Wheeling, whence, by the Pennsyl
vania and Susquehanna canals, the National
road and Baltimore and Ohio railroad, we have
a direct, expeditious, and very cheap communi
cation with Baltimore, where the great routes to
the Southern Atlantic States are intersected.
Labor and materials for the purposes of both
the book concern and newspaper establishment
can be at all times, and readily obtained here of
most suitable character and quality, and decidedly
cheaper than in any other city or town within
the bounds of the conferences represented in con
vention ; and in proof of these assertions, we
cite the facts, that there are now in this city the
most extensive and flourishing book publishing,
book binding, newspaper and job printing estab
lishments to be found west of the mountains,
built up and sustained against a previously estab
lished competition of Cincinnati and in the
Eastern cities. And we are authorised by a
highly respectable and responsible firm engaged
in the publishing business in this city, to say
that they can and will engage to furnish ma
terials for and print and bind any amount of
book-work for your organization as good in
quality and on as favourable terms as any re
sponsible house in New York or elsewhere will
engage to do it. And they further authorise us
to invite the delegates of your convention or any
committee thereof to visit their establishment, in
spect it and their work, and confer with them.
There are now in Louisville five banking in
stitutions wielding an aggregate capital of over
seven millions of dollars, buying and selling ex
change upon every quarter of the Union, and
1 through which funds may be transmitted to or
! drawn from one or more cities or towns in every
! State east, south and south-west of us, so that the
book concern and newspaper establishment may
here enjoy every desired facility for the transac
I tion of their financial operations.
| Louisville may truly claim to be as healthy,
I winter and summer, as any city in the Union,
: and this we consider a circumstance which adds
! not a little to the comparative weight of her
claims as the site of the establishment^ referred
to.
And last, though perhaps not the least of the
grounds upon which we claim that Louisvillle
should be selected as the most suitable location
for the book concern and newspaper establish
ment, is one upon which we ought to say but lit
tle, yet we may without indelicacy, refer to the
established character of Louisville for liberality,
as some evidence that whatever is promised will
be fully performed. The citizens, generally,
and the Methodists of Louisvilleand vicinity, will
contribute as liberally towards the funds neces
sary for the building up the proposed establish
ments, and maintaining them if located here, as
the citizens, Methodists,or authorities of any other
city or town have proposed, or will propi se in
good faith to contribute.
With the foregoing suggestions, we most res
pectfully submit the claims of our city to your
consideration, believing that wherever you do
locate those establishments you will be guided
in the location by a conviction that you are doing
the best for the glory of God and the interests of
our beloved church, and whether located at
Louisville or not, we sincerely believe and hope
that none will support those concerns more cor
dially and liberally than the Methodists of Louis
ville. William Riddle,

Mr. Evans rose and asked for privilege to
offer a resolution; leave was granted, arid he
then submitted the following : «
Resolved, That in the judgment of this con
vention, it is not necessary that the general
causes and nsctssUus for a separate organiza
tion should be discussed any longer, unless
some members from the border conferences
should think it proper to do so, in order to re
present their portion of the church correctly.
Mr. Evans, in support of his resolution, said
that all. the leading or main questions has been
fully discussed, and thought, therefore, it was
time to bring the arguments to a close. He was
afraid an improper impression had already gone
abroad. The public mind would be impressed
with the idea that we had a great conflict over
the resolution now pending, and that it was dif
ficult to harmonize the views of the members of
the convention, when, in fact, there has been
great unanimity of feeling and sentiment in all
our deliberations. He wished, however, the
members from the border conferences to be
heard, provided they had a desire to speak.
Mr. Brush said, so far as he was concerned,
he had no particular desire to speak, nor did he
believe any of his colleagues had any special in
spiration, prompting them to address the conven
tion. They had held a caucus and proposed to
select some member of their delegatian to repre
sent the views of Kentucky, yet they were a lit
tle fearful to make an election, lest the fact of
designating a special speaker should drive away
the spirit. They had, therefore, concluded to
await the movingof the spirit. They had as fine
speakers in Kentucky as could be produced in
any other country. The Kentuckians were or
ators by nature and by education, and the twelve
were all speakers except Dr. Bascom, who sel
dom spoke save in the pulpit. They employed
him in writing, he therefore had not time to
speak; but,sir, as to the remaining eleven,they
can speak equal to Brother Crowder, Dr. Smith,
or any member of the convention.
Mr. Kavanaugh said he was not in the meet
ing to which his brother alluded, and did not
therefore understand that there was a determin
ation, upon the part of the delegation from Ken
tucky, not to speak. He had been pleased with
the course the discussion had taken—the senti
ments expressed by the brethren from the South
proper accorded with the views of those from
the border conferences. And he was fully satis
fied we owed it to God and the church to separ
ate. It is true, said Mr. Kavanaugh, the border
conferences had been greatly agitated; but, sir,
they can bear more than the extreme South. In
the contemplated separation they went with the
South because the South went with the discip
line. They were disposed to be Methodists ac
cording to law and usage. He said princi
ple identified them with the South, and with
the South they would stand live or die.
He said that we are obliged to be a border
conference, whether the line of separation
run on the one side or on the other*; if it run
North then it identifies them with the South,
just where the principles involved should locate
them ; if it run South, our position would be
extremely awkward, we should be considered
traitors to the interests of Kentucky, and the
North, so far from welcoming us, would look
upon us as intruders, and as having transferred
our odium upon them—the odium of that vil
lany of all villanies; and thus we should be left
where the eatly history of our own land always
placed them, on the “ dark and bloody ground."
There was no choice, Mr. Kavanaugh said, belt
them ; they must be identified either with the
North or the South. So far ns he was concerned,
he intended to follow principle and cleave to the
doctrines of Methodism. Mr. Kavanaugh briefly
traced the history of the chuTch legislation on
the subject of slavery up to the late general con
ference. Upon the action of that conference in
the case of Harding he dwelt with peculiar force
and emphasis; he showed that it was a triumph
of prejudice over law. Up till the time the vote
was taken, he had been fully satisfied that the
decision of the Baltimore conference would be
reversed, and he had so expressed himself to a
friend. What then was his astonishment when
the general conference, by such a vast majority,
affirmed that decision. Upon Mr. Early’s mo
tion to reverse the decision, he was astounded.
The roll began at New York. N. Bangs (the
first name on the list) was absent. P. Rice re
sponded no I It fell like thunder upon his ear,
and thus through the whole list of Northern,
Eastern, and Northwestern conferences, the
noes continued to roar like peals of thunder, till
he was completely overwhelmed. From that
moment he was alarmed and felt that the South
had nothin? to exDect.
Mr. Kavanaugh briefly and in the most gra
phic manner sketched the history of the pro
ceedings of the general conference in the case of
Bishop Andrew, and the injurious influence they
had exerted upon the South. We regret that
we have not room for the whole of Mr. Kavnn
augh's eloquent and logical address. His al
lusions to the patriotism of Kentucky, and to the
I loyalty of Kentucky Methodists, and their fixed
purpose to adhere to the laws of the land and the
discipline of the church, were most touching,
producing the finest effect upon the audience.
In conclusion, Mr. K. assured the convention
that Kentucky, though in some instances misled
by designing men, yet in the end she rvould be
found right side up. Addressing himself to his
Southern brethren, he said, while they main
tained principle he would always be found in
their ranks. Their people should be his; where
they went he would go; where they died, he
would die with them, he would be buried, and
with them he would rise in the morning of the
great day, when truth and purity would meet
their just reward.
Mr. Stringfield, of Holston conference,Messrs,
Patton and Monroe, of Missouri, followed,
showing the ;Jfeition which their conferences
occupied in relation to the great question. We
have no room for their remarks. They all
however, showed their warm adherence to the
South, and assured the convention that, though
they had been somewhat disturbed by internal
divisions, in the end their people would go en
masse with their Southern brethren.
Messrs. Gunn and Harrison, of the Kentucky
delegation, each added a few remarks, the first
defining his position. He said it might be found
in his votes, as recorded in the journal of the
last general conference, and in the protest and
declaration to which he had plated his signature.
Mr. Harrison, from the Ajigusta district, stated
to the convention that some'differences of opinion
existed in his work, and he feared that in the end
there would be soro* discord.
On motion the convention adjourned. .
Twelfth Day.
Wednesday, May 14.
The invention met pursuant to adjournment,
Bishop feule in the chair.
The usual religious devotion was conducted
by Rev. H. G. Leigh, of North Carolina.
The journal of yesterday was read.
The president called for reports. ' ■
The Rev. J. Early, chairman ol <h« commit*
tee on finance, presented a report, which was

convention. *■
Dr. Capers, chairman of the committee on

The president called for memorials and peti- ,
tiona.
Mr. Hanner presented a petition from the %
quarterly conference of the McKendrie charge,
Nashville, Tenn., ashing the attention of the.
convention to Nashville as a suitable place for
the location of the contemplated book concern,
and inviting the convention to select that city as
the seat of their first general conference.
On motion, the consideration of the resolution • „
pending at the hour of adjournment yesterday
was resumed. *
Mr. Pius, of Tennessee, addressed the conven
tion briefly. Though not of a border conference,
Mr. P., did not wish the main question to pass
without a few remarks from him. He was not
a member of the general conference of 1844, he
therefore felt the greater solicitude to approve «
the action of the magnanimous minority m that >
body. ' "
Mr. Pitts said the merits of the subject had «
been ably discussed. There were a few pointtL
however, which he wished to notice, that had
not been specially dwelt upon by any of thepre*,,
ceding speakers. He alluded to objections *
which had been urged to t separation; not by .
our enemies, but by some of our doubting friendsi
It had frequently been asked, why so hasty to „
consummate our plan of division? By refer
ence to the history of our action, it would be seen ~ *
that the South had evinced any other spirit than
that of rashness. There was a point when .
forbearance ceased to be a virtue; we had reach
ed that point now. Here Mr. Pitts gave & sue- * ,
cinct statement of the numerous efforts pf the.
Southern delegates to preserve the union of’Hs *'
church at the last general conference, showing "
that all these were staved off by the majority J ""
and even the proposition ot the bench of bishops.' . >
for postponement, tne last star in tne Heavens, ■
had been beclouded by the action of the majori
ty. who discourteously laid their communication
on the table. The minority had been driven by
stern necessity, not by a sickly paroxysm of ex
pediency. He feared, by the way, that he sboaid
never love that word expediency again. If we *0
hesitate, he would ask if we could hope even to
secure the co-operation of the majority in the
work of division? If, said he, we again submit „
this question to the majority, they will rescind or
expunge the last vestige of the plan from the ,
records, and send us adrift without a single plan)c *
of hope. This is not an unheard of thing in the
majority. One general conference could easily
remove the landmarks established by another.
Instance the address of th’e bishops to the gene
ral conference ol 1844, the report of the commit- *
tee on the Westmoreland memorial, and the »
resolutions regulating the testimony of colored
persons. Mr. Pats pursued his argument with *
force and pathos, closing with a declaration of ,
his firm purpose to adhere to true Methodism aa
set forth in the discipline and maintained by the
church in the South.
Mr. Brock, of Memphis conference, said he ’
represented a border conference. It was bound
ed on the North by the Ohio, extending down
the Mississippi river 300 miles or more, includ
ing a fine country, chivalrous people, many
Christians, and a great many negroes. He said
the subject which had agitated the church had
been fully canvassed in the primary meetings,
quarterly conferences, and the annual conference,
in all of which there has been great unanimity
of sentiment and action. His connection with
that conference had been short, and therefore he
begged to refer the convention to the statements
of his colleagues, who had been pioneers of
Methodism in that country and had suffered
much and labored long in the cause of Christ
among that people.

until now, that he represented a border conference;
he thought the resolution precluded him the
privilege of speaking; but his brother Brock
was an ingenious man and had actually demon* '
strated that his was a border conference, and
therefore, though he had declined all idea of
speaking, he was actually forced into it. He
would be brief, for he had always preferred to
hear others preach or speak than to appear prom*
inent himself He had been listening attentively
three days, longer than Job’* friends held their
peace, but now he supposed he must open his
mouth. Mr. M’Mahon thus, after a very humor*
ous preface, proceeded to five an interesting
sketch of his early connection with the church
and the ministry. He had thirty-three years ago
preached the gospel at Jeffersonville, just across
the river, in the Governor’s house; they had a
glorious shouting time. By solicitation he came
to this city when there were but five male mem
bers in this place. He had beef taken from Ohio
by Bishop M’Kendree to clear him of the Abo
litionists. He was thought to be a good hand
to manage the slave question is Kentucky, and
therefore he had been brought to this State, whero
he preached to the master and the slave, and
from that time to the present he had labored spe*
cially to promote the salvation of the African
race. And really he thought the negroes loved
him ns well as they loved Bishop Andrew.
We cannot give the entire of Mr.M.’s speech.
He was so rapid in his flights of eloquence that
the reporter could not keep pace with him. His
address was most felicitous, and he sat down
amidst the applause of the audience. .
Mr. Gunn made a few remarks, by way of
explanation, referring to the address of Mr. Pitts,'
Mr. Crouch, of Kentucky, addressing the
chair, inquired, Mr. President, may I say a word?
I have no speech to make, but I will simply re
mark. 1st. That I am a southerner, a thorough
southerner in feeling and church policy. 2d. I
was the first one of the Kentucky delegation, in
the late general conference, to take ground with
the farther South. 3d. From that ground I have
never removed a hair’s breadth; nor have I had
any reason in the least to recede. 4th. When
my constituents shall call on me for the reasons
of my course in this convention I will present
them. 5th. When it shall appear to me that the
convention cannot get along with business and -
do thing* correctly, without my counsel, I will
give all the light I have; but until then lam -
willing to keep my seat /
Rev. Dr. Smith, of Virginia, proposed that the
question be now taken on the resolution offered
by him some days since. Dr. S. said that he
would take occasion to remark that the protract*
