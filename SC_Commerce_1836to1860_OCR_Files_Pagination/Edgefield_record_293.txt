"THE COTTON CtCLAR."
Tt is not my purpose 1o aiulize a!l the
nbst.ract propositios set forth in this ex
traordinary documeenit-a doentment which
is entitled to rull as imeich weight from tihe
tames attached to it, -is frmi any mcrlt it
may have in argnmet, or the prifoundl
truths it advances. I hall confine mysel
to a very lrief examination of the practi
cd troposiions it contains, for the fittire
action0 of ihose interested in the productiion
of cetton. Before we cons.ider this sub
ject in all its bearins, % c muust not too
readily adopt the idea, Ihat the producers
and constiners, the peculatos and re::;u
lar purchasers, of the article for conuiter
eial purposes.-to.-,ether wi:h the Banks

The Circular proposes to protect !te
plating or producing in:e:Lat. t1%ut It
nut be oaserved, that there i even a-dil
feretice in that intcrest. There are a large
portiion of planoters, partcu:llarly ii the
Sooth-WVest, who are 'delitors, and t !ere
are a large portion in the SombiI, who al
thtough they may not be creditor , vet

readily perceived, thaiiit those v.h o are dlbt
or-, ma.y desire advinces, whi;le those
who are no,. aiy he independent of a,!
vatnces. Now, it strikes me, that the Cir
cular proceeds upon tlie idei, that all
planters are debiors, andi need protelion.
This r utterly deny. It tay he, that there
are planters, who have ah-orbed their dis
titict character as such, in the character
of speculators in tle pitreliase and sale of
cotton, and it may be very expedieiii for
all such, to ally themiselves " tilt bani
and reerive tho faciliiies that imtanied
insitiutions, miny afford them in their
ohjecls; but what may *be life to thein
may he death to those, % ho choose a vcry
dilTerent course.
Considering the vast variety of indiiidu
al interests, it is a very doubtful proprioi
tion, whether any comhiintinii can be
formed, whose benefits will extend thein
selves equally to all; and a still mtore doubt
ful oae, ifeven such a cobihination could
be formed, whiher in the end, it would
tor produce like conibinat ionson thewiher
.jde', that would create sneh vibrations
in the price of cotton ns ralier to agra

I suppose the present growth of c-ottoin

ai bout 1,500.000 hags, or 525.000.000 lbs:

two millions of pounds crown in the U. S.

of medicine, whether cream of tartar or

existence, though that individual had nev

seen New-Orleatis grow up from a few
wooden huts to a widelv extended city,
with its hilh spired churches, its palace,
like hotels, with their domes ani copolas.
and its luxurious lookinug private edifices.
She saw thev time when its commerce was
carried on in a few Spanii b:toms,
whose arrivals were "far between," and
she had lived to witness its wharves crowd
ed with the shipping of every eomnmer-ini
nation in the world. She has seen the
time when its population numbered little
more tan a fev Iundred French aduven

100.011) and hailint from every nation in
Europe as well as tle childret of this con

ernmttet tlvttnsty oflie colony or State. She
knew it in the possession oiffrance, then
of Spain, of France agatii, and ere she
died it was without other rulerthan its own
fiee citizens.
All these changes but little - Tect:d the

the bliss of ignoratice in every thing but

Iler wants and h,.r wishes were few.-She

livered by Dr. N. Laborde, an hounorary
muemtiber of the Society A respectable
and intelligeut audicnce attendeu on
the occasiott. They evinced their interest
in ehe subjeei, by the strict attention which
they gave, during- the delivery of the

A lecture will be delivered before the

public are invited to atiend.
Aurora Borealis.-The Atrora Borealis,
was observed by several persons in this
place and neighborhood, on the even
ing of the 3d instant.. The spectacle
is described as one of extraordinary splen
dor. The not thern part of the firmament
was beautifully illuminated-bright va
riegated streaks extending from the hori
zon to o .e zenith-sheddiug as much light
as the rising sun.
Congressional Vacancy.-We are in
formed, upon unquestionable authority,
that t-e Hot. John P. Richardson, Be
presen' ative from the Congressional Dis
trict, composed of Lancaster, Chesterfield,
Kershaw, and S-nter, has resigned his
seat on account of ill health, and that writs
of election will shortly issuo to fill the
vacancy.
Our at tention has been called to a com
munica ion. signed " A Cotton Planter,"
which appeared in a late number of the
Sothtt Carolinian. We have inserted it in
our paper, to-day. The article is -ably
written, and nerits'the serious attention of
the Southern Planiers, and the conmtmity
generally. It will lie seen, that the writer
isopposed to the scheme proposed by the
authors of the last Cotton Circular. Ii be
hooves our planters to deliberate seriously
on this scheme, and all others, to preserve
the sten : price of cotton, before any -nc
tion is ake:'. If a Convention assemble
at Macon, in October next, we know not
what they - :y do, but we hope at least,
that they will dono harm. The establish
ment of a great C-tton Bank, of whjch
some writ - s have spo'.. n. meet-ts not our
ap -oba io'. The scheme, to us, Iseems
to be fratight with evil. Tte combination
of Banks attd Planters is dangerous, to say
the least, a d not ing but imperious'ne
cessity ca- er. - -e "ire it. We hope thut
this necessity may never arrive! e
