WASHINGTON, April 4.
Intiie.Senate this morning, there were
as usual; numerous petitions against the
annexation of Texas, or any change in
theyresent tariff act.
fi-. Breeze introduced a bill author
ising the sale of the several mineral lands
in the Territories. He also gave noice
of a bril.to abolish the West Point Acad
emy.
In. the House, the consideration of the
Army Retrenchment bill was received in
Committee of the Whole.
Ater a speech from Mr. Coles, an
amid neet'"was agreed to which. abol
ishes punishment by stripes in the Army,
and substitute imprisonment at hard labor
for a term of years. not less than one, and
not more than six.
Mr. Holmes moved to amend the bill by
providing that in future no private soldier
shall be compelled to attend a place of
worship where such attendance is prohib
ited4by the church to which he belongs.
Mr..H. made a brief but pointed speech,
in support of his amendment.
Mr. Petii, of Ia., followed: He said he
was glad ;to find one gentleman liberal
enough to agree with him in part, in cor
vecting the religious abuses of the Army.
He wished, however, Mr. H. had gone
further and abolished the obligation to at
tend-any place of worshtp. He would,
however, accept-the amendment submitted
on the principle, that "half a loaf is better
than no bread." Mr. P. then expressed
his regret that he was prevailed upon the
other day to withdraw his amendment
abolishing the office of Chaplain in the
army. From what he had heard since, he
was convinced that those Chaplain enjoy
ed a sinecure ; for they were very . remiss
in the performance of their duty. In cou
clusion, Mr. P. hoped the law.would be
amended so that the Heads difDepartments
and all other officers of government would
be compelled to attend some place of wor
ship. He could not see why the private
soldier should be controlled in this respect
any more than they.
After further debate between Messrs.
Hale, Carroll, Black, and others, the
amendment of Mr. Holmes was rejected.
The bill was then reported to the House,
and the amendments of-the Committee
of the Whole concurred in.
The bill was then read a third time and
passed -by a vote of 109 to 36. It is
thought that numerous additional amend
ments will be made by the Senate.
The various reports from the miunority
of the Select Committee on the Massachu
setts resolution, were taken up and order
ed to be printed.
The Pension and Fortification bills, as
amended by the Senate, were taken up
and the amendments referred.
The joint resolution of the Senate, fix
ing the 27th of May as the day of adjourn
ment, was next taken up.
Mr. Dromgoole moved to postpone its
further consideration till the 12th of May,
by which time, he thought, the House
would be better able to judge as to the
time it would require to despatch the bu.
sines of the country. After a call of the
House, the question was put, and the mo
tion: prevailed. The vote was 91 to 75.
Nothing else of importance transpired.
April 5.
IJ the Senate atiadditional regiment of
memorials i favor'of the present tariff,
werepresented and referred. . Mr. Buch
anan. lone presented fifteen from Penn
M. Evans submitted a resolustion,wvhich
lies over one day, calling upon the Presi
dent for copies of any corresponidence be
tween this country and Great Britain, on
the subject of annexation of Texas. The
President. is requested'- tp .say whether
Great Britain3 has, attempted to interfere
in any way~ whatever. It is understood
that the reaIgbject 'of the resolution is to
procure a copy of the despatch' of Lord
Aberdeen, which was communicated to the
-President atthis time the new British Man
ister presented his cr~dentials. This des
parchWilI show that Great Britamn desires
no political" connexion withi Texas, but
one of a commercial, character -onff.
Mr. Bayard called u~p the bill, explan
aior 'of the'act to regulate~the N-ivy."
The bill' provides thiat-i the officers and
crews of wrecked vessels shall be com
pnsated for their losses,'provided a Court
Martial decjde that the wreck was not
* caused b ineligence.
a This bill was: opposed by Mr. Alleni on
the gyound that it- would lead to neghi
gence,'antI defe'nded 'by Messrs. Choate
and Stiyatd. At the request of Mr. Buch
anait,.it twas thein laid aside.
Mrf. 25sple offered a resolution which
lies over~,for one day, calling on the Pres
.ident for'in'formnatiofl, relative to. the con
-dition of claims of our citizess against the
Republic of Columbia .and, whether it is
expedient that the payment be enforc~ed.
After the reception of memorials against
the annexation of Texas,.tpe Cumberland
Road~bill was agaip taggn-up and debated,
without any-final actiaguntil the adjourn
Intspe Hions., after'debate, 10,000 extra
copiei of the minority report 'o Cotmmi:
ttee ofWays end Means, on the tariff, was
ordered to.be'printed. .
The bill providing for the improvement
of certain harbors atnd rivers was then ta
ken up is. Committee of the Whole.
A long debate on -a motiern to increase
.framn $50,000 to $100,000 'the appropria
tion to'r the improveme~nt of the Ohio river,
-' above th."-Falls'.ny Lonisville. . Finally
the motion prevailed..
The debate was then-renewed on a mo
tion to ad $100,000-to the sum appropri
ated for the river below the- falls..
Mr. Davis, of Kent ely,.advocated the
appropriation and enlarged on the extrav
agant administration of Mr. Van Buren,
and the delit of 8 millions he left for the
W to ne wasglad to find one Whi~g
ge ntlqnconsctentious enough to admit
thatiliadlebt~was but eight millions ;
-beae irIgthe last Presidential elec
tion, it waU obstinately repeated, in vari
ous quai-ten, that the amount was 30 mil
ioas. Mr P. thed:-ezplained how the 8
millionsiWas 'made up. ;First there was
the de5taessumed~ by-tthis' Government,
which' the District owed. :to 'Holland,
amountisgo neat-ly a miilhon.and a half.
Ne w.as the great' amount "of Ti-easury
notes issued during. tho .last war, &c.- .
After the disporing of this,.Mr. P. procee
ded to reply to.othri ciarge's iwhich had
beeut made against the Democratic Party.
In the course of his remarks he paid a high
compliment to Mr. Calhoun, and said that
he was one of the. brightest stars that ever
shone in the galaxy of American -states
men.
The debate, which was purely of a party
character, was continued, without taking
the question, until the adjournment.
It will be remembered that in the sum
mer of 1842, the celebrated Mr. Colt,"ex
hibited the power of his submarine battery,
by blowing up a vessel on the Potomac,
at the distance of nine miles. He is again
in the city, and is making preparations for
another grand experiment. He proposes
to explode'a vessel, under full sail, on its
way to our Navy Yard. If he can accom
plitsh this, the advocates of reduction of
the Army and Navy will have something
like a tangible argument.
A pril 6.
The Senate was not in session to-day,
it being their practice to devote one day
per week to business in the Committee
Room.
M r. Choate has given notice that he will
on Monday call up the report of the Fi
nance Committee on the modification of
the Tariff.
In the House, the consideration of the
bill making appropriation for the improve
ment of certain harbors and rivers, was re
sumed in Committee of the Whole, with
the understanding that all debate shall
cease at 2 o'clock.
The question pending was still on the
amendment of Mr. Hoge, to strike out
$180,000 and insert "$223,000 for the im
provement of the Ohio River, below the
Falls at Louisville. and of the Mississippi,
Missouri, Illinois. and Arkansas rivers."
After a somewhat tedious debate, the
amendment was concurred in.
Several other amendmeuts were sub
mitted and rejected. The hour of two hav
ing arrived, the debate terminated. and
the question was put on about fifty add
tional amendments, nearly all of which
were rejected by acclamation.
Mr. Weller moved to add an additional
section. appropriating $75,000 for the con
tinuation of the Cumberland Road.
Mr. Holmes, of S. C., moved to amend
this it ation by. adding "five million of dol
lars for continuing the said koad to Ore
gon." When this was read by the Clerk.
a burst of laughter arose, which lasted
se'eral minutes. Every one saw the drift
of the satire. The amendment, was of
course rejected, as was also that of Mr
Weller.
Mr. McConnel moved to amend by inser
ting $50,000- for the improvement of Salt
River. This the Committee agreed to
amidst roars of laughter, it evidently be
ing the general understanding that the bill
will be rejected.
Finally the Committee rose and repor
ted the bill, when without taking the ques.
tion on the amendments, a motion to ad
journ prevailed.
As the death of Mr. Moore, one of the
Representatives from Ohio, will be an
nounced on Monday. I presume no busi
ness of importance will be transacted on
.that day.
On Tuesday, the Tariff Bill will be ta
kei up, and considered from day to day
until finally disposed of. It is understood
that not more 'hau a week or ten days will
be allowed for debate.
As the House is tnanifesting a disposi
tion to despatch all the important busi
ness in s summary a manner, I presume
there will be no dif~culty in-the way of an
adjournment by'thc end of May, unless
something unexpected shall transpire.
A pril 8.
-No legislative business was transactedt
today in either bratnch of Congress.
In the Senate. the death of Mr. Moore,
late a Representative from Obio, was atn
nonneed by Mr. Tappatn. Hie pronounced
a brief Eulogy on the deceased, of wvhose
theological principles, however, he kntew
noihing. But, said Mr. T., I knowv that
his life was pure, and in the words of the
poet,
-For forms of faith, let senseless zealots
fght, -. '
His cant be wrong, whose life is in the
right.
The tysual resolutions were then adop
ted, after which the Senate, out of respect
to the memory of the deceased, immedi
ately a'djourned.
*In the House, the same melancholy duty
was performed by Mr. Walker, whet a
motion to adjourn was made and carried.
Several oilher members are in a very low
state of health.
A pril 9.
In the Senate there were some scores
of memorials from the Northern and Eas
tern States, in favor of the present tariff;
also against th'e annexation of Texas.
Mr. Buchanan presented a memorial
from respectable citizens of Lancaster Co.
Per.nsy yania, under the following circum
siances. It appears that after the battle
of the Brandy winie, several hundred sick
soldiers were taken care of by a seet called
the Seventh day Baptists, then residing in
the above county. About two hundred
of the soldiers died, and were buried by
their kind friends on a romantic spot,
called Mount Zion. The place is now
overgrown .w ith bratmbles, and the present
inhabitants desire to raise a Monument to
the memorry of ihe brave men who are
there entomhed. To aid them in this,
they ask .the aid of Congress. Trhe me
moriai w as referred. -
A great number of reports of.a private
character . were: made. from Committee,
after which the Senate resumed the con
ideration of the tariff resolution from the
Finance Committee, recommending the
indeiniie postponement of Mr. McDuffie's
tariff bill.
Mr. Berriein having the floor, spoke -at
*great lengthb denying' the Constitutional
power ofthe-Senste tojtake cognizance of
such a hill.'
Mr. Colquitt has the floor to-morrow.
The Senate then spen't. a. short time in
Executive Sssion. The following, nomi
nations were cotifrmed, viz: Senator R.
W. King, as Minister to France, andl Go
ernor Shinnon as Minister to Mexico.
The confrmation of Mr. King caused no
ittl surprise. -ted fsm
In the House, after th isposlofsm
unimportant business, .Mrs McKay muoved

purpose of takingup the .taritt bill. - The.

-Mr. Tibbalt movvl to suspend the roles
for the purpose of ofering a resolution pro
viding that all dcbat'on the old harbor bill
should cease at 4 o'cock. The motion to
suspend succeeded ; trier which. a tedious
debate arose on the'esolution, the main
point io dispute being as to the origin-of
propositions to close debate at a certain
hour. Each party Lail the blame on the
other. Finally, the retolution was laid on
table.
The House then wett into Committee
and took up .the above bill, without any
understanding, however as to the time fur
terminating the debate.
Mr. Simons moved t.add $20,000 for
Bridgeport Harbor.
On this amendment a debate arose, du
ring which Mr. Holmes expressed his as
tonishment that the bil should have been
taken up at all. Afte' they had cut down
the army and navy to-the lowest possible
scale, be was not prepied to see this sys
tem of internal improvenent presse.d for
ward, which would swillotv up millions
and drain the Treasury however ample
our means. He called ipon every friend
of State Rights to oppoe the bill.
Mr. Paine resumed aul concluded a po
litical speech he commented on a former
occasion. He went on tc shew from the
newspapers, that the Whgs'have ditierent
principles for different paus of the country,
etc. He then caused to be read at the
clerk's desk a song from the "Clay Min
strel."
Mr. J. R. Ingersoll tboight it had better
be sung, To this Mr. Payne said he had
no objection, provided the gentleman
would act as leader. (Lead cheers.)
The clerk then read tie song. At the
end of every second line here was a cho
rus of "Hurra ! burrs! lurra !" These
words the clerk was loudly called upon to
sing, but that proving no part of his busi
ness, he did not comply.
The song coecluded as bllows:
I re:kon he will win the iny.
So boys, three cheers for lenry Clay.
Hlurra! hurra! hurra!
When the book vasclosed there ivas the
greatest uproar I ever hearl,-both parties
enjoying the joke.
Mr. Payne resumed, aid argued that
these songs shewed that the Whigs in
tended-to open the campaign (it 1844 in
the same manner they.hat carried on that
of 1840, viz: by a constant hurr ! When
he concluded, the pending ttendnent was
agreed to. Several otheri were rejected;
after which, the Committee rose and the
House adjourned.
April 10.
In the Senate an unusually large num
ber of Memorials in favcr of the present
tariff, were p'esented and teferred. Among
them was one numerouslysigned from cit
izens of Richmond. Va.
Mr Crit tenden, 'n presenting one of a
similar character, took occasion to express
his conviction, that so far as the Senate
is concerned, no change till be made in
the tariff the present sesson.
On motion of Mr. Wright, a resolution
was adopted directing the Judiciary Com
mittee :o inquire into the expediency and
constitutionality of authorizing the Presi
dent to commute all sentences of death
against criminals, into simprisonmen for
life. Mr. W. said for himself he expressed
no opinion upon the subject. He offered
the resolution at the request of others.
- Mr. Evans reported a bill, authorizing
the payment of uncancelled Treasury
notes, in all eases where persotis may
have received the anme ini good faith.
After the. dieposatl of a mass or unim
portant business, the Senate resumed the
ronideration of the tariff resolution.
Mr. Colquitt havitng the flour, spoke for
some honrb in reply to his -colleague, Mr.
Berrien yesterday.
In the House, it will be recollected that
otte weeks ago, Mr. Kennedy, of Ky.,
offered a resolution, calling on the Huse
to adopt cerain sentiments of General
.fackson, rebative to protection. To this
M r. Brown, of Indiana, bty way of amoend
met.offered a resolution calling on the
House to adopt the following latiguage
alleged to have been used by Mr Clay.
-Carry out the principles of the Cornpro
mise Act, look to revenue alotie for the
support of Government. I had hoped
That question had been put to rest. There
is no necessity for protection."
The''correcttess of the extract being
doubted, the matter was laid over until
Mr. Brown shall have heard from the ed
itor, of the "Ohio Statesman," from which
paper the extract had been copied.
This mnorning Mr. Brown again called
the -attention of the H ouse to the subject.
- e said that in looking over the files of the
National Intelligencer, he had come across
a speech made by Mr. Clay in reply to
Mr. Woodbury, in 1842, where, if not the
same words, the same sentiments as those
embodied in the extract were to be found.
Portions of- the speech in question were
then r 1(1 by the Clerk.
Mr. ,;hite, of- K'., replied : Wit hout
imputing any thing personal to Mr. -B., he
again deet .-ed that the extract in thie reso
lutien of that gentleman, was a falsehood
and a forgery. Mr. W. then called atten
tion to the speech just read. From that it
appeared that -the language actually used
by Mr. Clay, was "there is no necessity
of protection, for protection," that is for
the sake of protection. Mr. WV. concluded
by repeating that during the whole course
of the public life of Mr. Clay..be never
declared in an unquali8ed -mantner that
there ssas no necessity fhr protection.
The matter having been disposed of,
the House adlopted a resolution, orderitng
the printing of 1500 Maps to illustrate the
experitments of Professor Espy, on the
theory of storms.
Mr. Dromgoole moved :o go into Com
mittee of the Whole, for the purpose of
taking up the tariff hill. The motion was
rejected. Yeas 86-Nays 87.
Mr. J. R. Ingersoll moved to suspend
the rules for the purpose of oflering a res
olution, making the tarifi hill the special
order for the lust Tuesday in December
next.
After a call of the House the rules were
suspended.
Mr. Drorngoole moved to amend the
resolution so as to-make .the tariff bill the
special order for to-morrowv.
The motnsion f'ailed. Yasn 8t..Nays 92.
The question was thec put on tberesO
uion to make the bill the special order
or the last.Tuesday in. December. Tile
esult was--Yeas 83. Nays 100. So the
esolution teas rejected. These votes are
onsidered as indicative ot an intention to
ci upon the tariff question, but not of its
tassage.
Mr. M'Kay, with a view of saving time,
nd of co-.ning to the point at once, moved
tsuspension of the rules, for the purpose
>f offering a resolution making the tariff
yill.thespecial order for Monday next, and
,very day thereafter until finally disposed
>f. The rules were not suspended. The
vote was, yeas 101; nays 76; not two
birds.
A message was received from the Pres
dont, in answer to a resolution, transmit
ting copies of all correspondence relative
o the Dorr troubles in Rhode Island. It
was referred to the Special Committee on
that subject.
Mr. Ingersoll, from the Committee on
Foreign Affairs, rported a bill for the re
lief of the owners of the Spanish schooner
Amistad. The bill appropriates $70.000
as a compensation for the "illegal deten
tion of satd schooner. and the illegal libe
ration of slaves." The accompanying re
port sets forth that although the judicial
tribunals may err. Congress ought to shew
to the world that justice shall be done.

This is an admirable production, of great
interest and value to the - people of the
South, and especially the producers of
that great staple article which has, in a
remarkably brief period of time, effected
the most wonderful revolution ever known
in the industrial pursuits and avocat ions
of mankind. It is a, work long needed;
for it is remarkable, considering the pres
ent general use of cotton, how little is
known, even among those most familiar
with it, of its origin and progress to the
present time, and especially of its great
antiquity. The pamphlet comprises 62
pages, and we have rarely if ever met with
a work on any subject in which so vast a
fund of information has been compressed
into so small a space. Its estimable au
thor is one of the most enlightened and
liberal-minded citizens of our State-i
true Carolina gentleman, in the most ele
vated sense of the term-who after many
years of active and efficient service in the
councils of the State, has devoted, in his
signally dignified and honorable retirement
the effirts of a highly cultivated mind and
ardent patriotism to the improvement of
the first and best interest of his beloved
State-her Agricultural interest. It is
indeed strange, that this interest should
have been of all others the most neglected
and depressed ; and probably no otne has
done more to arouse and aid the present
general spirit of enquiry in it, than the
able author of thtis adtmirnble work. His
efforts have been most active and unucea
sing for years, utnder the most discouraging
athy and indifference, which woultd have
overcome any zeal but the most generous
and determined, stimulated by thte warm
est and most disinterested patriofismn. His
numerous able newspaper andl pamuphilet
essays have been marked by thte same er
dent desire to- advance the interests anid
elevate the character of the South, anud es
pecially those of South Carolina-a State
whose ntame has ever been as mausic in his
ear; and-her honor andI character as dear
to hitm as his own, and the chief objects of
his gallantt and chivalric devotion. But
we are wvanderiug ftrom outr purpose-from

WASHINGTON, March 30.
Gen.- Henderson arrived on Thu'rsdayv;
Mr. Calhoun, yesterday. The Treaty of
Annexation of Texas to the United Stateb
will nowv he negotiated. andc in a short ime
be laid before the Sennte for ratification.
In comnmercisl parlance, I confirm my
letter of the 28th inst. Neither the Go
vernment nor the people of Texas will
cosent to any postponement of the ques
tion of Annexation beyond the Session of
Congress. The national enthusiasm of
the people of Texas, in view of the pros
pect of Annexation is overwhelmitng and
irrepressible. If the Government of the
United States postpone or refuse to ratify
a treaty of A ntexation, the revulsion of the
public mtnd in Texas will prove fatal to
any farther negotiation on this subject;
and General Henderson, as he is believed
to be instrueled, will proceed to England
and negotiate with duat government a
commercal treaty on the basis of free
trade, which will for ever put at rest any
farther desire ro the part of the people of
Texas to be annexed to the United States.
Texas will become a great commercial
depot for the trade of Entglatnd and other
European powers. The commerce of
Texas, Mexico, and Central Amnerica, will
e lost to thtis country. The Agricultuaral
interests of Texas will 'oecome antagonis
tical to the agriculturel interests of our
Southern States; and in a few years,
Texas will raise every bale of Cot vtn ne
cessary for the consumption of the En
aish Manufactories. English emigration,
Englisht Capital, Englisht conmerce, Etn
glish enterprise, and English influence,
will overwhelm and swvallowv up every
thing that is Artmericain, anti estrange the
people of Texas from their loyalty to the
United States. What will the Senuate do ?

The Philadelphia- U. S. Onzette coptes
the following from the New Ycrk .Amer-:

to condemn.
Without Texas, Slavery must die our

With Texes it.cannot he perpetual long
but yet long enough to gratify the present
generation, and induce. them to move
Heaven and earth-no "iot heaven, for
heaven must frown upon such an attempt
-but Earth and Hell to accomplish the
annexation.
The Free States-we warn them-must
not be lulled into inaction by the pause as
to the treaty: though that courso may he
abandoned, the annexation, by act of Con
gress. oill be attempted, and unless over
whelhned by such ekpression of popular
indignation as shall prove irresistible, it
will succeed. We say this advisedly
upon information not to be disregarded
and with a full, deliberate, and unshaken
conviction that annexation, come in a hat

-The Philadelphia Gazette then rebukes
this miserable threat at length. -
It is not a wonder that a threat, to dis

Recent Valuable American Invention.
One of the most elegant coverings for
beds is the fabric which bears the name of
Marseilles quilt. It is woven in the hand
looms of Europe,.and as that mode of
npanufacture is slo-v and required an ex
perienced workman'to each loom. It has
hktherto not been made in this country, but
imported from abroad.
An ingenious artisan in Massachusett,
has lately invented, we are told, a method
of making Marseilles quilts with as much
facility as the common brown sheetings
wvhic h costs nine cents a yard. A power
loom, driven by steam. envolves the beau
tiful tissues'finished with great regularity
and symmetry; the raised figures, on its
surface exhibiting almost every imagina
ble variety of pattern. A. little girl, or
any inexperienced person, may attend
several looms at .once. The price of the
fabric can only exceed that of common
brown sheetings by the cost of the waae
rial, inasmuch as the labor of producing
it is no greater.
Ingrain carpets, which form the princi
pal cov-ering of ourjloors. are also woven
in Europe by hand looms. and the. ex
pense of employing the necessary work
men has hindered the extensive introduc
tion of the manufacture into this countrt.
The person to whom we have already al
luded, has invented a power loom for wea
ving ingrain carpets with the same rapid
ity that the lo.ms of our factories turn out
the plainest and coarsest fabric. A certain
rich capitalist at the eastward has expen
ded, we are told, $80,000 in assisting the
inventor in his various experiments to
bring it to perfection, which he has al
length succeeded in doing. A little girl
stands at the machinery and tends four or
fve looms; which jerk out the fabric with
incrediblo rapidity. As the principal ex
pense of making this kind of carpeting
has hitherto been the cost of the labor, thet
price will be greatly redluced by this in,
venttion. Its atathor has been offered, wt
have been assured, 80,0001 for the patenmi
right in England, but ibis, his obligation.~
to the capitalist who has furnished binr
with the means of bringing it to perfection
forbids himt to accept.-N. Y. Eve. Post

powers." observes the Siecle, "make
great boast of their zeal for the abolition o
the slave trade, and they allow the Turk
to sell and buy white women for the ba
rons." "Doritng the meonth of Januari
last," says the Nationel, "the Pasha o
Trebizonde forwarded to Constantinopli
a cargo consisting of 230 Circassian slaves
mostly young women, intended for thu
Sultan's harem. This traffic is a direc
violation of the treaties of Adhrianople. I
is expected that the Russian Ambhassado
will protest against this act, particularly a
there are several Russian subjects aimonij
those slaves.

Sigato died without divulging the chemical
discovery, and probably the German Abbe
may have hit upon the same process.

Decar Sir,-The piece alluded to by the -
Yorkville paper, as having been published
iin the Temperance Advocate, relative to
my hogs, made particular mention of thrse
Berkshire Pigs, which the editor supposed
would average 'over two hundred pounds.'
supposing his estimate too high, when
-they were 7 months old, and very soon
after Mr. Martin saw them-I weighed
one of them-result 270 lbs. I thought
- e weighed the heaviest; it was how
ever doubt ful as they were all oaf very near
the same size. These pigs were the pro
duce of a sowv I bought of Mr Bement,
of Albany, and by a remarkably fine boar
of Col. Hampton's If you take pleasure
in looking at fite Hogs, call when conveia
ient and see my stock.
Yours truly, J. W. Panasa.
