Roots are fed out profusely bv some (
farmers to their stock. That they are
valuable, no one doubts?but we have ,
sometimes" thought that where more than !

given out the nourishment it would have
furnished had it hcen longer retained.
Where such results follow, though your

We deem it doubtful whether i
the use of toots diminishes to anv c.oiisid- j

an animal requires; hut where roots are j
used, meaner hay will answer the pur- '
pose, and the stock will come out in a :
much better condition in the spring.

In a second, the Department of Cart*,

is so groat, that the site of any pa",
iiciilar edifice is hardly to Ikj distinguish.
;d among the ruins. In the city, the
louses, even to the stone work were
thrown upward hv the shock, and fell
down again in heaps of rubbish.
It is painful to dwell upon this event.
1'he loss of life is very great among all
[ lasses?all ages; the number is not even
to he estimated ut ibe present moment.
The inhabitants of those villages in the
Department, which have 'suffered the
least, have assembled hv order of the
|
llovernmcrii, with spade* mid picks, to
lisinter the hodiew. They are now hard
it work, and will continue digging while
necessary, People perished iu the streets,

we are suffering a horrible state of want,
which ts likely t? continue, for the fences
having been tnrown dew;., the cattle are
destroying all they can reach. In Turidaba,
Tresrois, Cartage, Paraiso, Ujaines,
ind even to the vicinity of.Mutiim, there
is not left a single shed; and in every one
if the valleys, and on the haciendas, we
find proportionate destruction.
From Sam Jo.>e to this place, nnd to

thrown down, and those houses that are
standing are uninhabitable. IVe are bardly

'J'he Committee which was delegated
from the Board of Trustees to attend the
' Examination at Florai College, at the
; close of the first Session, made a Report
^ from w hich the following is an extract;?
' The tirsi Class in English Grammar
'consisted of about, twenty Students. The
} facility with which these corrected false
English, and applied Rules in Parsing,
j indicated close application to, and iut
, accurate knowledge of their studies. The
; second Class, consisting often, are on
; respectable standing* and showed evident
; marks of application.
j Tii#1 lirst (.'lass in Bofarv, equally nu.
j rnerous with the first in (jraiitiiim, did
| well. The second also.
! A Class in Chemistry acquired much
j credit.
The examination of a Class in Genme.
try passed oH' tolerably well. Had its
members been less agitated, they would
I have acquitted themselves better.
The Ciass in Natural Fudosuphhy dc;
serves praise.
I The Heading and SjH-lling Class did
well in Spelling The Readers progressed
| with ease, and were generally correct in
j pronunciation; but were deficient hi other
respects.
I The First Class in Arithmetic was
large, and gave great satisfaction. Toe
Rules were at command, and applied 1111:

I
The Second Class did not perform
quite so well.
Miss Mary R. McRac, Miss Elizabeth
Me Each i n, and Miss Caroline M-Eichi
ern, constililted the Class in Rhetoric.
Tuev wore prepared as lar ;*s die doth
i page hi Emir's Lectures, and examined
| in tire diopter on Tas?e. They wore
highly approved.
j A Chws was examined ill Grimsliaw's
! History of the CJmted Stales, and nieri|
ted much praise.
| Th*r First Class in Geography was
highly ciHinnendr I. The second w as
not cqiKil to the First. In this branch of
study, n little girl, about nine years of
ofagtvcainc forward to Ih* examined n.
lone. Her name is Marry Ann McKinTion.
Questions were rapwhy propounded
anda>promptly answered by the little
Student. It appeared as if she hud made
the to wr of (lie Earth, and become ac.
qualified with every kindred and tpugue
and mtlion ami people.
The Specimens in Drawingnnd Fainting
skewed taste and judgment.
' t* i :L:. _ _j
tiiu l,oj>y hooks exnionea cviocni improvement.
The hand.writing was characterized
by case and regularity.
The wond day of the Examination
was now for spent, when the Musical
Class. numbering fifteen. was called up-,
i Each in b<-r trirn played nmlsnngr Miss
! Martha Crawford and Miss Mary Ann
| Fnirlcv had made some advances in the
j study arwl practice of Music before fliey
came to (his I n.^t i I lit ton. They still
hold thrrr supciioritv. Those who were
heat qualified to judge of the proficiency
made by the members of this Class, gave
them moth praise. We can not dismiss
this subject, without notice of a display
made together on the Piano, by two mem
hers of this Cias*. viz.: Miss Marv Ann
Harllee of Cheraw, hoih equal in size and
! in age, 1*2 or 13, whose performance excited
much admiration. %
Lastly, as if l>v enchantment, all the
I Students were formed into a semi.circle
| around the Piano, ami joined the Itistruc,
tress in singing that beaiitilul little song,
| Home, sweet Home." The sympathy
-of ho many silver voices lloating on the
mellifiuous tones of the Piano, reached the
i listening ear with thrilling effect. The
1 occasion was an appropriate one. They
i now took leave of each oliier with lender
i regret, though the plar.d sensations of
1 iVweet Home still nlaved oi. (heir checks.
j The assemblage of spectators was nil*
| meroiia and respectah.e. The College
j Hall, though large, could not contain
I them all. They tnunifestt d a lively in*
| terest in the occurences of the day, and
I on the ;>nrt of the Indies, the anxiety, was
j intense. They were pleased to see the
Sun of Science shedding its balmy inttu*
| ence over the land ; feeling that nothing
could elevate the female character to its
; proper rank so effectually ns this mental
; culture. Such were the happy result-*
at the termination of the First Session at
| Floral College. A happy prcsoge of the
future, whose * coming events cast their
shadows before."

The modern fashion adopted hv our
belles of wearing hustles is not so new
as many persons imagine. In 4he reign
' nf James 1. the fashion of ladies wenrin*'
I
1 verdingladcs. in order tn make themselves
i to have enormously largo hips, appoors
| to hove reached its height; and about
i the same perns! the men adopted the
plan of stuffing their trunk hose tor the
same purpose. A writer of the day de.
scribes these stuffed trunk liose as a kind
of 4iverdingale breeches." Tins ridieu,
tous custom occasionally led the wearers
1 into awkward predicament*. On one 00
I ension it is related thai a young man so
dressed and distended with bran, while in
1 conversation with snine. ladies, unfnrtu:
rudely tore his hose with a nail and all
! the. bran escaped, leaving him so much
reduced in size as to he scarcely reoog]
nizablt*. At one time n law was passed
prohibiting the men n^ainat wearing their
.breeches stuffed with bays; and a man
having been taken before a justice on ,pp.
? i ' w 'it
position of infringing this law established o
his innocence l?v drawing forth the .slat, z
fing, which consisted of a pair of shoots, a
i two table cloths. ten napkins. four shirts, ;
i a brush, a comh, night raps, and some i M
i other minor ai tieles. The ladies, wh>o j j*
I were the first to s? t the fashion in this; |
, way, were not a whit behind the gentle- | ..
I men in the size In which they distended i
! themselves; hut whether the gentlemen [ '*
