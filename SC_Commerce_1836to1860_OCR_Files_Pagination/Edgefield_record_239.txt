EXTRACTS
From the Report of the Committec of"fays
and Means, on the state of the Treasury
tid the erpenditures oJ the Government,
P"vmiitted by Mr. Vambreleng, to the H.
of Representatives, January 24, 1839.
By the 63d rule of the House of Repre
sentatives, it is made the duty of the Com
mittee on Ways and Means to "inquire
into the state of the revenue and expeudi
tre, and to report, from time to time,their
opition thereon." The condition of our
fitances renders the discharge of this duty
particnlarly necessary at the pre'enlt time.
Our extraordiniary expenditures have,
within a few years, been unavoidably
large,and our revenue has rapidly declined
since 1836. In that year our income for
customs and lands was more than forty
eight millions; in 1837 (including the post
poned bonds) it was about twenty-lour
millions; and for the past year (deducting
the postponed bonds) anout fourteen mtl
lions and a half. The revival of trade will
increase the revenue both from customs
tind lands, and, notwithstaning the pro
gressive reduction in our tariff, it will prub
ably be sufficient to meet the wants of an
economical administration of the Govern
ment. We have, however, no just reason
to anticipate such an excess of revenueas
to warrant a continuance of extravagant
expenditures; and the present reducied
state of the Treasury atflords a proper oc
casion to inquire what branches of these
have been unnecessarily increased, and to
endeavor to restore the aggregate expense
of the Federal Government to the eco
nomical basis contemplated by the act of
the 21st March, 1833, anal correspondin-g
with the mnaximumn duty of 20 per cent. ad
oalorein after June, 18-1:, proposed- by
that act.
Our Federal expenditures have been
-rapidly. though irregularly, i ncreasi ng,from
1789 to the present time. The fluctua
tions appear to have been simnitaneous
with an increasing or decreasing revenue
-anoverflowing Treasury uniformly pro.
ducing a sudden augmentation of our ap
propriations. Independent however,of stcb
occasional extravagance, it was natural to
anticipate, especially in the first half cen
tury of its existence, a steady increase of
the civil, military and naval expenditures
of a Government which had no stch es
tablishments at its origin; and particularly
in a country which has, in so short a pe
riod, doubled the number of States in the
Confederacy, enlar:;ed its boundary of set
tlement to near 5 times its extent in 1790,
increased its population from less than four
to near seventeen millions; and extended
- its post route from 1,S75 to near 133,000
miles.
During the war, large investments were
made by our capitalists in manufactures;
and when it was over, the principle of our
revenue laws was entirely reversed. Our
taxes were no longer graduated by the
wants of Government, but by the demands
of our capitalists for protection; thus sub
stituting the incident for the principal.
Our tariffs were revised without any re
gard to the condition of our finances, ahd a
broad foundation was laid for a redundant
revenue. The consequence was a rapirl
extinguishment of a public debt, funded
and unfunded, of one hundred and fifty
.Millions of dollars. Anticipating this re
demption, appropriations in every branch
of the public service were increased, and
still more extensively to absor a prospec
tive surplus, new objects of expenditure
.%were sought for, which had been before
considered under the jturisdictiotn of the
States. Surveys were anthorized, laying
the foundation for a Federal system of
,oads, cimals, harbors, and other improve
metms, sufficient to exhtanst any surplus
which mighm possibly occur. Extrava
gatnce was demed patriotic, as designed
to perpetuate rjotection to manufactures.
The one was ndispensable to the other,
-and fo-r a ti~i the nights of the tax payer
were wholly disregarded.
This attempt to interfere with the rights
of the States, and to enlarge Federal ju
risdiction, eendituere and patronage, was
partiall eted at an early stage, by
leaving he States the exclusive and
consiti ttional control over their roads and
canal Butt there still remaitned other
expendtrs which wil be noticeed here
after, equally foreign, as the cotmmittee
think, to tief ' imate dutties of a cotnfed
orated Govrs nt. But notwithstand
ing theese, the e ravagant tendency of a
sturplus, atnd tledrapid redemptiotn of our
pmublic debt, weflave been already cotm
.pelled to dfogatite eight-nd -twetnty miil
lions ii he States. Fortuttately, howv
over, this as6istion of ptrotectione, sur
plus, and -. gance, is no longer thce
policy 0 'overnmeat. Both Houses,
by overwbiesmin majorities, revived our
ancient prinbip jl, evenue in the act of
2d of March, 1833. e foturth clattse of
the 3d section of that aetrrovides that af
ter the 30th of June, 1842, uties shall be
laid for the purpose of rca vsuch reve
uine as may be necessa - a economi
eat administration of4overnmaent."
Believing, as the c" ltee do, that no
other policy can be Wnanently sustained
in a confede eendent States,
they dee ~ ent to examine out ex
penditu otail to 'ascertain what re
forms ha introduced to bring them

~O'sing to appropiations of the charneter
refecrred to, antd to others wvhich will be
mililbed, there is a very considerable appa
*e'ti iiese of the Federal expendietures
'in the lhst'ten years. The appropriations

Ournaval and military expenees have
been greater since 1829; ihe former owing.
in part, to tho uncertainty, at one tittle. of
our relations with France, and the latter
to Indian wars. But our expenditnres
have been, since then, increased in every
branch by augmentation of the amount of
commercial credit, which adds to the cost
of all our supplies.
The Legislative expenses of the Fede
ral Government for the first ten years were
annually, on an average, about ,171,000;
the appropriations for the year 1.83 were
$982,000. A part of this has ariseti from
tihe increase in the number of members of
Congress; but the most extrava-ant in
ci ease ha-; occurred in the contingent expen
ses of both Houses. In the first ten years
these did not amount to mnore than M10.
000 annually; while the appropriations the
past year were $373,960. Alihoug iunder
tho immediate observation and contril or
Congress, there is no branch of the public
service where there has been more abuse
and extravagance. Thousands of loeo
ments, in many instancespfrno importance,
are annually printed; and the contiagent
funds of the two nouses have been, for
some years past, charged with the expense
of furnishing members with books. There
has been, and still remains to be paid, on
two contracts of this character, $781,023
37, not only to supply-those who are actu
ally in Congress, but others who have not
been members for many years past.
Should such expeuditures be continued,
this will very soon become an important
item; and in any event, a large amount
will still be required to fulfil contracts for
books in no manner belonging to the le
gitimate contingencies of either House of
Congress.
The expenditures of the Executive De
partment were, in the ten years 'fter spe
eife appropriations were made,about S 195
100 annually; the appropriation for 1838
was $75,0 i0. This iter has steadily in
creased with the growvth of otur country and
its various establishments, requiring Exe
utive agency and superin'endence. Some
ihing would probably 'ie saved if there
were one contingent fund under the contrrl
af the Secretary, for all the offices of each
Department. Otur complicated system of
)eounts, too' was establihed many years
ago; and a inore judicious organization of
the Departments might introduce greater
simplicity and economy, it is impossible.
owever, to avoidl a uniform increase in
his branch of the public expenrditure,
vhile we continue to multiply our laws at
very session, which mutst be carried into
AfThct by thre Executive Departmentsa; and
while we rapidly increase, as we hatve
lone of late, the numbier of resolutions iu
yoth Houses. calling for information, and
requently involving great laboi and ex
ese.
These approprmations have been, and
ust continue to he. very tuneqal among
ho States- Trhe Union has ai comimon in -
erest in bait few of thema. It maly have in
hose running through or in the neighbor
ood of our puIblic lands, whlich add value
o the common properry. But it is cer
ainly unjust to apply the money collected
n some States to mere local improve
nenrs in a distant quarter of the Uinion,
imply because they appertain to the zomn
'nrce of the count ry. If every imapmove
near of harbors. rivers, and creeks, andl the
auilding of piers,is to be considereud national
a its character and benefits, it is dillicult to
lene any limit whatever to hie juridiction
af the Federal Government. or to say to
what purpose tire common funtd of the Unii
>n nagot be app~lied. The distribution
une during the last thirteen yeatrs among
e States, proves, incontestably, the ir'jnis
ice of these expenditures. Thre whole a
mount approprinted andr invested is 12.300),
)00 dollars, of which 5 100,000 dollars has
een granted to a district of country not
ne hundred and fifty miles from the Capi
o. Without inquiring into the itmpor
ance of thre works patronized by the Fedl
ral Government. it is sulficient to remark
hat the mtost of the States have been, at
he same time, employing their own mon
y and credit on improvements infiniteiy
more us'eful. and profitable, and better cail
~ulted to extend the commerce of the U.
uon. Some of the States have not par
icipated at all in these Federal appropria
ions, while four Atates only may be char
~ed with 6,760,000 dollars out of the 12,
300,000 dollars, and some of the most ex
pensive works remain to be completed in
hee States. If it is intenrded to make
this system permanent, justice requires
that sonmb more jutst rule of distribution
shold be adopted.
.This system. if permanent. must also ve
ry soon prove seriously detrimental to orr
anval and mnilitari establishments~ and'd.e
[Such Improvements, though generally
tpercly local, are suppdrte d-in both.louses
by a combination of votes, !vhich secures
their preference over all other expehdi
tures, however important the latter may
be to the defence of the country: With
an experience of only thirteen years. we
have already a draft ofnear two millions
annually tipon the Treasury for such im
provements. Should we continue to in
crease them, appropriations for national
defence will become of secondary impor
tance, and-will be reduced to increase the
expendit ures for ourCongressional districts.
Neither the condition of our finances nor
the state of the world, warrants us in ap
plying the public money to objects not
connected with our common defence.
Should the House determine on authori
zing new appropriations for fortifications,
harbors. &c., and on charging upon the
revenue of 1839 S2,982,000, in addition to
an tnexpeuded balance undrawn at the
commencement of the yeae of $1,682,000,
besides the amount in the hands of the
disbursing officers, it will be necessary to
instruct the committee as to the node of
raising the revenue reqnired to meet these
expenditures. There is no probability
that the receipts from all sources in 1839
will he more tIhan sufficient to meet una
voidable expenses, without the addition of
ant txtraordinary appropriation whatever.

lands, exclusive of the postponed boeds.

the limitatiotn of the Trreasury note act of

In the Senate, to-diay, Mi,. Wright', from.
the Cumintee on Finance, reported the
hill to secure the public money in thi6 handil
of Government agents, and to punish pub
ish public defaulters. This is not the Suh
Treasury bill. Mr. W. gave notice that
he shoull call up this bill on Tuesday next.
Of the House Sub-Treasury bill, we have
heard nothing. It may he brought up at
the heel of the session, as a natterof form
but a chance lr its passage is looked
upon as very bad. The prospect is, that
the matter will be recommitted to Con
gress. and that it will depend upon the e
lections yet to take place.
The Committee on the Judiciary, to

Mr. Morris' -ultra abolition resolutions

and Mr. Norvell moved to lav the motion
to consider them on the table. In some
little conversation that ensued upon the
motion, Mr. Morris said that the conduct
of Congress in reference to petitions.
would be sufficient to dethrone any tyrant
in Europe. The subject was laid on the

In the Senate, to-day, the most extraor
linary speech, ever delivered in that body

Senator Morris, of Ohio. The occasion
f it was the presentation, by Mr. Morris,
3fa large packet of abolition petitions from
Ohio. A thousand living, witnesses he
aid, were now brought forward by him
to prove that abolition was not dead, as
the Senator trom South-Carolina: (Mr.
Calhoun,) hail the other day declared.
Abolition was stronger in his State, than
wver it was. He congratulated Mr. Cal
luoun. on his belief, ia having passed
through the aibolition storm. But lie as
oured hint that the titme had gone by when
slav'ery would be defended as an Ameri

Mr. ElvMoore'speeeh, introductory to
the remonstrance ofcitizens of thisDistrict,
agai 4st the.reception of petitions from peo
pie of the States for the abolition of slave
ry in the District, has appeared here; and
it will, I understand, be extensively pub
lished and distributed among the people of
the North and West. It furnishes a lucid
and popular view of this. humbug "right
of petition.', against the tneasion of which
our Northern incendiaries have attemp
ted to raise such an out cry. Mr. Moore
clearly shows that a refusal by Congress
to receive such petitions. is no dienial or
any--right;-while. ontlfc' otherindJtre
continued reception of them, makes-Con
gress a party to the combination of fanatics
and in cendiariesagainst the public peace.
I believe the speech will have a good ef
feet at the North. by disahusing the honest
portion ofthe people of the erroneous o
pinions inculcated among - them, of this
"right of petition."
Mr. Slade took an opportunity, to-day,
to furnish a little steam for the abolition
cause, by Introducing a resolution,' calling
for an inquiry into the subject of the
spectacle, which he alleges to have been
exhibited here, on the 30th ult,, to the
members of both Houses, of some slaves, I
chained, &c.. and conducted through the
streets. The'resoltion lies over one day.
It is impossible to prevent such assaults
upon the House, by any precautionary
resolutions. Just as impossible is it to pro- o
rect Congress from abolition agitation, by
means of the Atherton or any other reso
lutions. A rejection of all petitions and
papers touching the sutju'ct of slavery, is
the only thing that will defeat the designs 4
of the abolitioni'ts. -
M r. Rtssell submitted a resolution. for
setting apart Thursday next for the con
sideration of a bill introduced last session,
providing for the construction of a ship
canal around the Falls of Niagara. But
the resolution, giving rise to debate, lies
over one day under the rules.
. The Speaker laid before the House a
number of Executive cmmunications in
answer to resolutions of inquiry. Among
them was a message from. the President,
transmitting a correspondence between this
governtnent and that of Great Britain, in
relation to the burning of the* steamboat I
Caroline. last year.
The States were then called in their or
der for resolution3. A'ter which thie House
went in-o Committee of the Whole, and

Very little business was transacted in
the Senate to day. Mr. Wall made a
long'and able speech against 31 r. Critten
den's project for preventing government
aflicers from interfering in elections:
Mr. Benton called the attention of the
Semite to the card that appeared some
time ago, denying the assertion which he
mande in the Senate, on the authority of
Gov. Dickerson of New Jersey, that Mr.
Webster told Gov. D. that he (Mr. W,) I
was "not consulted' as to the compromise z
act. Mr. 11. said lie had received a letter
from Gov. D. reaffirming the fact. Mr.
Webster explained that he never told Gov.
D. that he was not constilted on the 'sub
ject. - le was advised of the project: but
he told Gov. D., perhaps that he did not
euter into any consultation, with any of c
the friends of that measure in regard to it. c
February 13.
The Senate, to-day, was again enigaged.
chiefly, upon thce bill to pi eveut iterlier-.
ence with eleclions. Mr. Strange spoke
in reply to the rermarks made y,:sterday by I
Mr. Rives. M r. Buchanan will speak to
morrow, and I leartn that Mr. Preston willI
also spetak upon it. T1here is no prospect
of the passage of the hill, in any form. Ini
oppositioni to the project, it is contendh-d
that the bill deprives government oflicers
of itnalienable political rights, and enlarges
the piowers ofuhe President by making him
the witness, judge, and juror, in everyn
ease where an oflicer is charged with 'a(
violaiiitn of the Iciw. On the other side, I
it is argued that the elective principle is
the only IOnserva.tive prin"iple of our gov
ernment, and that to whautever evtent it
may be subject to Executive conitrol, to
that extent it becomes corrupt and in- I
active.
The House devoted most of the day to
co)nsideration of District bills. Mr. Gui
dung--. of Ohio, attempted to matko it aboli
tiun day by bringing up the abolition topic
itt the debate otn some bill concerning the
District of Colinhia. Butt he was pro
nounuced out of order by the Chair, and
wans, after some trouble, put dlown. t

er', a journal of their proceedlings tip to this(
timte, and daily hereafter, during the resi
dlue of the Session, and the same he printed
for the use of the House, and that so much I
of the' resolution as perm its the Committeet
to employ a printer, be rescinded from this
date, and that said Committee bte instrutc
ted to hold their meetings in public.
A grent deal of debate took place on the
Senate bill, to prohibit the giving or re- a
ceiving a challenge to fight a duel in thei
Distrtct.of Columbia, and for the punish
ment of the some. Many amendments
were oif'ered, dlisctussed, and- voted down. ~
Mr Jenuifer of'ered on anmendment provid- 1
ing that any member of Congress who shall
icnsultanother, ip debate, shall be required *
to make an apology to the house and to
the country. it iwas Mr. JTenifei-'s inten-.
lion to follow this up -with a motion,-that.
the member refusing to apologize, shonld '
be expelled. Manty and very obvious rea- l
tons were urged against the arnendment,
tad it was rejected. The debate was'
nontinuedl on the amendments till a late
botur, when after a call of the Houtse, the
bill was passed to a third reading--105 I

Report of the Committee of Ways ait'
Ifeans.-We publish 6o-day, some ex
racts from this 1%port. Southern gentle
nan of high intelligencehave pronounced
t a satisfactory document, ably defending
he cause of State Bights. . On the otfer
land, its opponents have denounced it in
he most unmeasured terms, seeming .to
hink ihat it has betrayed the South.
[hey appear to be opposed to it, mainib
ecause Mr. Cambreleng-is Chairman of
he Committee, who reported it.- They
uppose that "no good can come out of
iazareib." They think. that' the South
equires not such supporters as Mr. Can;
releng and his party.
" Non tali awilo, vie defensoribus isti .

If the principlesof the report, be correct,
vhy condem it? Reject not a good thing

'ime will show whether 'the principles

We are indebted to thelHon. Ely Mqeee,

wes Mr. Moore a debt for the exposure
f the nefarious schemes ofthe abolitionists

Ehe argumcnts or this gentleman, are
