From the Southern Literary Messenger. m
VISIT OF LAFAYETTE TO Mr. CRAW- 1
FORD IN WASHINGTON.
It was not in crowded saloons that .Air. | m
" i u . r _..r i._
L-rawioru cuuiu mua .uuy hivli v us uu cr
wished to meet frim?as a dear and long
esteemed friend. JTe therefore invited him
into the country, and fixed on a morning for na
his breakfasting with him in asocial and t*a{
domestic manner. .
The only company invited to meet him ^
at Mr. Crawford's house, was a family living ^ (
on the adjoining farm, intimate friends, as
well as near neighbors. Judge \ ,
the Comptroller, was to bring Layfayetle .
out in his carriage, while his son and pri.
vate secretary were to follow in another.
When these arrangements were made
known by Mr. Crawford to his family, pa
some difficulties were started. " We have
but one parlor, and that we must breakfast
in." " That is of no consequence," re. 5
plied Mr. C. "The company can sit with
me in my chamber until breakfast is rea- ua,
<*y." (th(;
" But it is so small it will not hold one ; wi
half the company." at 1
"Well, the weather is delightful; they | C(j
can sit in the piazza, or walk about the I . ,
grounds." _ j
44 Rut. nana.' observed one of the daugh. i
' ? . i ! F
ters, " we have neither our plate or china
here; nothing but our Liverpool sef"
, " Far more suitable, child, for this house, <
than the china or plate woiiid be." ! SJJj
u La, papa, I do not believe Gen. La- j n)n
fayette could eat with steel forks." | V0I
" True," answered Mr. Crawford ; " I . of
do believe you must send into the city for ,j;s
our silver forks. I believe th y arc indis- }1C
pensable." esc
" And the silver dishes and waiters, j t'.)r
papa." I c0|
" Pshaw!" interrupted the father, " all i wa
that would be nonsense."
" Dut," observed the neighbor lady, who j y0,
happened to be present, " I presume you j ja(]
will send for a French cook." < pin
"Indeed,I will do no such thine." said ! ? 1
the good lady ot the house. " My fine \
firicd chicken, and corn bread, are better I ]J
in themselves, and will be greater rarities to | tai
him, than any dishes the French cook could ; va
prepare." ! an
Mr. Crawford sat smiling at the prolong, j tcl
cd discussion, on similar points, between i tje
the ladies, but settled the matter by saying, j m
4 4 My dear, let the breakfast suit the house ; j *n
the plainer the better. Lafayette is coming , '
to visit his old friend,?not the Secretary \ v.(
of the Treasury." 0"n
And plain the breakfast was, as any j
American farmer need to give ; but at the j
same time as excellent and abundant as ' s0
any Virginia planter could desire?. And i pa
every one knows what a Virginia break- j tj1(
fast is ; of what a variety of meats, (nc- W(
ver forgetting fried chickens and ham) and
bread and cakes of all kinds, that are made 1 jn
of wheat, Indian meal, or rice, I scarce- ! j]C
ly believe a Scotch breakfast, or a;
French dejeuner a la fourchette, can ex- !
ceed it.
The morning was as bright as uncloud- |
* ? +\.
cd sunshine, a blue sky and green carin , rc
could make it; the atmosphere was almost I
sparkling, and the spirits were exhilarated ^
bv its freshness and elasticity. j ^
The little company, consisting of Mr. 1
Crawford's family, and that of his neigh, i
lor friend, were sitting in the piazza, en- ..
joying the morning air and the scene, when
the barouche and four and the attendant \ ,
carriage, drove into the grounds. Mr. C. i
advanced to the steps of the piazza, with s0
his wife and eight children close around j "
him, and received Lafayette, not as the fr'
guest of the nation, but as his old familiar
friend. The General threw his arms *
round Mr. Crawford's neck, pressed him to ; c>
his bosom, and, a la Francaisc, kissed his 1)(
cheeks. Mrs. Crowford and the children j ^
were then introduced, and individually and ; t'1
cordially greeted, when a general introduc- j m
tion followed. j J1
Mr. Crawford led-the way into bis chant- Ie
w nnrt inok his oldeasv chair. An arm \ v<
UVI J v
chair was offered Lafayette, but spying J st
. out a tow nursery chair that stood by the w
hearth, lie drew it close to Air. Crawford, n<
and sitting down by his side on his low seat,
took his hand, and looked up in bis face in j
a fond, familiar manner, which only those j di
who liavo seen Lafayette with his much be- U!
loved friends, can form an idea of?so ca- st
ressing, so affectionate. ! tl
The mistress and her female friends . hi
withdrew to the breakfast room ; the een. : oi
tlemcn walked out in the piazza ; and the S
friends were left to enjoy a tctc a tcte, after tl:
their long and eventful separation. it
The breakfast was served, the company bi
surrounded the hospitable board. ? Now," st
thought one oi the ladies, who kept a di- a<
ary, " now shall I hear conversation worth ci
recording ; I shall have an almost sublime tl
?at least on interesting page to my dia. 1 si
ry." She not only opened her ears, but I
her eyes, that she might drink in tho sense : U
of every word that fell from the great man's ; V
Vps. Well, and what did she bear ? No- 1 a
ling ihat was very wise or very witty, it i
inst be acknowledged ; nothing that would c
EFord matter for a record sue'1 as she ex- 1
scted. i
" Will vou have tea or coffee, Gene- I
tl?" * 1
" Tea, madam?tea, if you please. I)o {
an remember, my dear Crawford, what i
tcellent tea we used to get from May ? c
fell, my friend, May still lives in Rue de t
?, where he lived when you and I got a
ir tea from him. No man in Paris keeps t
ich excellent tea. I am still his custom- v
?" h
11 Is the old store standing yet V* b
" Precisely as you left it. No where
3 you buy such very good tea." f
" Help yoursol to some of this butter e
mj* wife's making ; you will find it al- b
ost as good as that of La Grange." tl
u Madame's making ? It is excellent." a
" At La Grange we have no better ; j,
y daughters always churn the butter evy
morning at the breakfast table."
" At the breakfast table ?" q
" ics, Madame, iu a beautiful little Chi- a
chum, given thetn by a friend. It is the u
shion in Paris for the ladies every morn, j
t to churn their butter at table, and so 0

id it is wonderful with what a variety of t(
autiful forms and fancies this pretty toy ^
embellished?for these churns are but _
0When
a pause occurred in this chitchat, ^
gentleman present inquired of Gen. La. ^
; .tte whether Baron Hamboldt was in
I c<
ris.
9 T 31
"Yes, sir, I left him there, as fond ofi
I yv
;h places as ever."
" Baron Hamboldt fond of high places ?" j j11
"Just so," replied the General; "he '
3 climed to the highest he could find, in 11
: sixth story, I believe, of tfie house m
icrc lie lodges." The company smiled
this play on words. " In fact, he want- P'
to get as far above the crowd as he n(
jld?out of its nois and tumult, and
irefore choose his apartment as high as 10

Ui*:m
A He is a great favorite with his king, I w
i 10101," observed Mr. Crawford. ^
!< No sovereign was ever so proud of a K(
jject,"answered the General. "He has w
ide him his high Chambcrlum, and when, 31
:i remember, Crawford?when the King ol
Prusia was in paris, he would never ^
pense vith his attendance, so proud was c<
of him. But tlie Baron, when he could sc
:ape and retreat to his solitary room, and c<
ow off his robes of office, felt himscll L
mpleteiy happy. The good Hamboldt ai
s never meant for a courtier." al
At last the breakfast was over; the tli
ting gentlemen accompanied the young pi
lies in a ramble through the grounds, and w

csts soon followed. It was an anima. tl

ly for the crowds ot happy faces lighted a

Responsibility of Ferries. a
Wc find the following notice of a case
cently tried in the Supreme Court of [,
n\v York, before Judge Talmadge, in r
c Journal of Commerce. j,
ndrcio Undcrhill and others, vs James B.
Clark and Silas Butler.
This was an action to recover damages
Dm the defendants as common curriers,
r the loss of sundry horses, wagons &c., ^
liich were on board the ferry boat Jack- .
n, when she was sunk last summer by
nning in collision with the steam boat oston,
in the East river. It was en- .
savored to be shown that there was ncg;cncc
an the part of the defendants, and
,'idcnce was adduced, from which it ap>ared
that the occurrence took place c
hile the ferry boat was on her first trip j
iat morning and that it was made at a (
uch later hour than usual. Some of the N
laintifts' w itnesses also deposed that when s
aving Brooklyn the ferry boat moved t
Dry slowly, and when she was about to r
art, the ferry master made observations f
hich tended to show that the boat bad j
at got up sufficient quantity of steam.? ?
1 reply to this, however, the ferry master (
aposcd that the boat being late was an or- j
inary occurrence, and although he bad f
sed the observations imputed to him, to (
isfy the impatience of the passengers, i
ic boat went off as well as usual, and in 1
is opinion she had her ordinary quantity J
f steam up when she left Brooklyn.? |
everal witnesses were examined as to I
ic condition of the ferry boat from which i
appeared that although she was an old 1
oat, and bad formerly been a horse boat, <
ic was nevertheless as strong and as well 1
hipted for a ferry boat as most of the oth- <
r ferry boat on the river, and had been 1
loroughly repaired a few months before 1
te was lost. {
In relation to the occurrence, it appeared ]
> have been the result of pure accident. 1
Hicn the ferry boat was about half way '
cros* the river. sbo saw the Boston com- '
ng down the river toward her and in or- h
ler to aveid a collision with her, the ferry n
joat altered her course and turned her head n
'p the river, and her broadside towards
Sew York. The Boston came between c
ler and New York, and when nearly op- f1
)0site to her, sheered a little from the shore u
n order to to avoid a small boat that was n
:oming out. This movement of the Bos^ J
on brought her suddenly into contrctwith .
i strong tide, which propelled her towards 11
he ferry boat, and although her engines
rerc stopped as speedily as possible, her P
iow struck the laboard side of the ferry ls
oat, and sunk her almost immediately.
It was contended on the part of the deendants,
that in the first place, the own- P
rs of a mere ferry boat cannot be held lia- ,in
le as common carriers; and socondh. &1
liat they were not guilty of neligence, Ul
nd that the occurrence was the result of l(
!. ~ i-1
iieviiciuit; utciueui.
Amount of damages claimed, 8650. ,
The Court in charging the jury said: 0
^he questions of law involved in this case*
re of so nice a character, that thev wilT*?
ndoubtedlv be reviewed by another Court. ?
t is however my duty to give you the law
n the subject.
Common carriers arc persons who habi- |
rally carry goods, and get payment for t
oing so. The doctrine relative to com- ge
ion carriers, applies only to the carriers t
f property, but not those who carry per- QI
>ns. Sloops sailing between Albany and a*
few York, tow boats and steamboats, are aj
immon carriers as they carry our goods
ad baggage for hire. The rules of law
hich apply to property and passengers,
re different, If you go on board a steam- w
aat, and that your person is injured, you ^
ave an action on account of it, but you m
iust prove negligence, and if you do, you cc
ive a right to recover. But if your pro- 0j
erty is lost, it is not necessary to show h(
Pgligence; it is sufficient to prove the loss tit
(your property, and unless it has Deen th
st by means of public enemies; or the th
:t of God, such as lightning or a gust of th
ind, you can recover for the property el
lough you are unable to show any negli- 0
mce.?These are the principles of law pi
hich apply to common carriers and which w
-e in accordance with the common law cz
: England, & the statute law of thisState. of
mong the class of men called common pe
irriers, all elementary writers have clas- ht
id ferrymen. They must be therefore lu
insidered as common carriers, until the in
egislature alters the law on the subject, p<
i event which docs not appear likely, as in pi
1 the alterations which they have made w
ley have left that untouched. If it was c<
roper that such should have been the law T
hen we had only sail boats, it is still ki
ore necessary now that we have steam- di
aats. and making ferrymen subject to tiie fo
w as common carriers, ami iinhlo* under 111
2rtain enactments, for injury done to per>n
or property, must have a beneficial tl(
fleet, not only as regards the community w
t large, but on themselves also, as for w
leir own interest they will take care to w
eep good boats, manned with the lest ai
ten, and the most skilkful engineers.
Applving these principles of the law to
i I tr
ic case before you, you win consoer
whether the loss was occasioned by the <
ct of God or the enemies of the country; *!'
ut surely suppositions arc of course out 11
f the question. The property was lost sl
y two boats coming in collision. Itmay 0
e that the Boston was in fault, and that ^
he struck the ferry boat on purpose, but .
ven that will not excuse the ferrymer, if
hey are common carriers, and I havs no
icsitation in telling you they are.
I deem it due to the defendant to jay,
hat there is no question of fact for you to ^
lecide on, it is entirely a question of aw, ^
nd you have only to say how much the _
diantiffs are entitled to. You will of ^
ourse do justice to the defendants, md p
mdcavor to ascertain as near as possble ^
tow much they have a right to pay the ^
daintiffs. tj
Verdict for the plaintiffs, $625.

MEMORANDA OF FOREIGN TRAVEL. $
BY R. J. BRECKINRIDGE. r
It is difficult to fix a precise date to the r
iommeiicoment oftliat period of declension
n pure religion, which during the last con- r
ury was observable ever all the earth ; and ^
vhich, especially towards its close, relap.
;ed into almost universal infidelity or her.
:sy. It is probable that we should rather
egard these sad catastrophics as being so
ar isolated in eacli country as to have
jcculiar causes and separate dates, as well
is diverse manifestations in each ; agreeing
)nly in the general fact of forsaking God,
ind in the special one of wandering far ^
rom him, in proprotion as they knew little
)f his truth before. The Catholics of Italy
ire exhibited, by all witnesses, and especial- J
y in the personal memoirs of the Bishop of
ihstoia, as sunk into the lowest condition of *
pollution and superstition?tiioseof France
iccamc a horrid model of ferocious athesrn.
The Episcopal church of England j
became essentially heretical?taking its ^
)wn articles as the rule of judgment?and j
rvhile its clergy openly exceeded the men <
}f the world in " sumptuous living," they J
^reached, (when they preached at all,) Af- r
ninian, Pelagian, and Arian errors. The
established church of Scotland died, and ^
piety went out from their midst, leaving
Dnly a barren orthodoxy and a cold externa!
Jcccncy of life. In the United States we f
felt the same withering influences, and ex- ]
libited the same varied results. To tf
iorth, Unitarianism grew up while in th
niddle and southern states Deism becani
lie common sentiment. The previoi
ondition of Massachusetts made itcertaii
larch away from God she would he Socir
?n ; while that of Virginia, after an equi
larch forced iier into condition of mor
easonable buttless religious skepticism
iven the mercies of God lavished societie
1 such conditions, blessed as they were i
le geaerals points, were liable to unusut
erversions, differing according to the es
ting conditions. Thus a wide and tru
wival of religion in New England endec
> a lementable degree, in all sorts of meta
hysical heresies?which still disturb thi
linds of men ; while in the west, the sam<
ifts were perverted into extravagant am
inatural system, regarding social life
hich are still exhibited among those callei
shaking quakers."
There is a great principle at the botfon
* all these varying results?a principle
liversal in the providence of God, as in
jenced by. or influencing leium in
iritual dealings with mankind. The con
tion in which we are, is the uniform basi:
'that which is to follow. The influence
)plied, of necessity produce some resuli
id whether good or bad, it is akin to th<
ate on which they acted. The gospel it
If either melts or hardens, and the eterni
before us will assume, in its most glorious
most aggravated aspect, no other char
:ter, to each separate spirit, than the etern
developement, perhaps, ofthat with whicl
emerged from its state of trial, into etor
*>' .
As with each separate individual, so als<
ith communities, the beginnings are mon
stant from the final result, than we com
only imagine. I suppose that the fina
tuse, humanly speaking of that awful stati
* society in France, which obscured witl
)rror the real benefits of the first revolu
)n, is to be sought at least as far back a
c revocation of the edict of Nantz, mor
an a century before its eruption, and tha
e brutal licentiousness of that nobles an<
erg}', under the regency of the Duke o

ere inevitable, under the given state of th<

nv illustrated more forcibly, at the sam
me, the truth of the principles alread

lesscd influence which her civil and relij

ondition to make her fall without commc
on, without bloodshed?without *he dot
uction of public morals, and to preserv
fter it, many of those habitudes, of whic
te spirit and life were gone. And wht
*as not less important, retained her in
tatc easily accessible to those previous it
uences, which in Geneva, as throughout a
'rotestant Christendom, are repairing tli
reaches of Zion, and restoring her lo
cauty. I would speak briefly of bol
iiese events.

e heart; it is all that sweetness of temper,
inevolence, innocence, and sensibility,
hich a face can express, that forms her
auty.
"She has a face that just raises your station
at first sight; it grows on "you every
oment, and you wonder it did no more
an raise your attention at first.
"Her eyes have a mild light, but they

but by virtue.
"Her features are not perfectly regular;
at sort of exactness is more to be prais.
I than to be beloved; for it i* never aniated.

"There is often more of the [coquette
town in an affected plainness than in a
wdry finery; she is always clean, without
eciseuess or affectation. Her gravity is
gentle thoughtfulness that soften* the
atures without discomposing them: she in
lually grave.
"Her smiles are inexpressible.
"Her voice is a low, soft music; not
rmed to rule in public assemblies, but to
larm those who can distinguish a com*
my from a crowd; it has this advantage,
du must come close to her to hear it.
"To describe her body describes her

"She discovers the right an^ wrong of

loseness and something selfish in their

"No person of so few years can know

"She docs not run with a girlish eageress
into new frindships; which as they
