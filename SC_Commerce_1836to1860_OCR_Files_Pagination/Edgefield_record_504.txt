ROSPECTUS OF VOLUME VIII FOR
1841.
In offering to the agricultural public of the
niteri States, the prospectus of the Eighth vol
me of the Cultivator, (the second of the New
cries,) we. desire the privilege of taking our
atrons and correspondents familiarly and cor
ially by the hand, and thanking them muost
eartily for the very liberal aid end support they
ave rendered us, both by theircommunications,
id their subscriptions.
The Cultivator was established to improve
rid elevate the Agriculture of the country; to
Ive a proper tone to the morals and mind of
ie farmer; to show him the dignity and impor.
mee of his profession; to store his mind with
seful knowledge, and convince him that while
I classes are and must be more or less depen
-nt on each other, he alone of the whole can I
ake any near approach .to independence. If
ere is one thing more than another, which in
is country gives a man superiority over his
low men, it is knowledge ; and this Anowl
ge,-knowledge which is as essential to the
ccess of the farmer as of other men, it is the
sign of the Cultivator to aid in imparting.
In taking charge of the Cultivator, the Edi
rswere aware of the arduous nature of the E
idertaking. Under its former conductor, this
irnal had already attained a very high cha
ter, and we might have shrunk from the task
sustaining the reputation it had'gained, or
im the efforts necessary to still farther elevate
-standing. had not the assurance of aid from
ablest writers and the mostexperienced faf
ro of the country,-aid which our columns E
11 show has been and will be most promptly
d fully rendered; encouraged us to the under- A
ing. How far we have succeeded must be
' for the readers of the Cultivator to deter
ne; but if an increase ofsubscri ption beyond
y precedent in the history of agricultural
irnals of this country; if the almost unani
mus voice of the public press in our favor; if E
t multitude of private yet flattering tcstimo- F
tis we have received, added to a cuculation C

last, the following report, as the result
its investigations:
A The -Academy has charged Messrs.
ago, do Mirbel, Poncelet, Gambey, Au
n, Baussaingault and myself, with the
imination of the Memoir of MAons. Bou- f
trio, relative to the preservation of wood,
following is the result of our labors :
'The Academy has already examined, (
th the most lively interest, the prepara- V
as of the author; and has before it, at
s moment, pieces of these so remarka
that the task of its commission is there
greatly abridged. Mons. Boucherie .
)poses to render wood much more dura
,to preserve its elasticity, to prevent
variations in volume which it ospe
nces through the agencies of dry and
mid atmospheres, to diminish its com
stibleness, to augment its tenacity and
hardness; and, finally, tocommunicate
it various and durable colors and odor-.
"To assume that all these exigencies
ve been satisfied, and that this has been
!omplished'by methods, cheap, simple
d new; and consummated through the
ency of substances that are cumrmont.
d which bear but a low price, is to fix
attention of the Academy, in a fewv
irds, upon the important features of the
3ject we are charged to examine.
"For the puipose of penetrating an en
e tree with preservative, coloring, or oth- C
mattor, the author has recourse to tto
,chanical, costly or complicated means;e
finds 4Jl the force of which lie has need,
that process, within the tree itself,-thc !
tie force by wvhich its owvn sap is elevnt
and distributed through its various parts.
tis, alone, suffices to convey from the
se of the trunk to the very leaves, all the
uids which he wishes to introduce, pro
led that these are maintained within cer
n limits of chymical concentration. If
ree be felled, while in full sap and leal,
d the base of the trunk by at once plung
in a vat er reservoir cotitaining the |li- C
id whiek it is desired the timber shall
bibe, that liquid. in the space of a few
ys, will ascend to the very leaves, and C
netrate every part of the vegetable tis- ~
e, except the heart of the tree, which, in
me instances of great age and hardness,
imperfect vitality, resists the absorption,
d is not pesnetrated.
" It is not entirely necessary that the tree
all retain all its branches and leaves dur- I
g this process, although it is important
at those of the extreme top should re
ain uninjured.
" It is not important that the tree shall
main standing during~the operation,w hich
ould not always be convenient: it may
p felled, and its butt submerged in the It
id it is destined to absorb, when this will
id its way to every part.
"On the other hand, the tree may be
sted standing, if this be preferred: for it
only necessary that cavities be cut near
ebottoml, or the trunk be partially sever
I by a saw, and that the parts thus prepar
I be put tn contact with the liquid, to en
te the desired result.I
"This species of penetration, or absorp
tion, which is effected in a few days, with.
out either difficulty or labor, is, as will be
readily seen, wholly different from any
means hitherto employed. Previous me
thods are well known to consist of forcing
the ingredients into the pores of the wood,
by powerful pressure, or ofQ introducing
them by the prolonged and imperfect ac
tion of liquids prepared at much cost, in
huge vats, in which timber is kept sub
merged.
" The 'new and ingenioes process of
Mons. Boucherie has placed at the com
mand ofindustry an immense natural force
which enables it, without cost, to conduct
into the most delicate vegetable tissues all
soluble substances which it may be desira
ble to deposite there.
" If the author has resolved, in a simple
and ready manner.the great problem which
he at first proposed, he has not manifested
less sagacity in his choice of the subwtances
which he has adopted for fulfilling all the
iudications announced above.
"To augment the duration and hdrd
ness of wood, and to oppose its decay,
either dry or humid, the crude pyrolignite
of iron is to be introduced into its tissue.
1This substance is wisely chosen, because
rudo pyroligneous acid is produced in all
the forests,in the processof'manufacturing i
:harcoal; and it is easy to convert this in
o the pyrolignite of iron, by simply put
ing it, even when cold, in contact with I
;crops of old iron; and because, also, that
he liquid, thus prepared, contains much I
:reosolo, which independently of the salt s
if iron, itself possesses the property of c
iardening, and of guarding against the at- t
acks of decomposition, as well as the de- C
truction caused by insects, wood and tim- a
er employed in constructions and for other d
wrposes. f
" Authentic experiments tried in the cel- v
ers of Bourdeaux, upon hoops, prepared d
y the author, have proved, in the most f
onclusive manner, the prolonged duration c
if wood, after subjection to his process.- il
l'he ordinary hoops fell to powder, upon s
he least application of force to them, while t!
hose of the same .age, which had been i
ubjected to his preparation, were as solid a
s upon the first day they were placed n
iere. p
"Ifhe wishes to preserve the elasticity si
f wood, and to render it less combustible, it
ie author has found in the employment -
f chlorine with an earthly base, the means a
f accomplishing these ends.. Ever pre- tl
ecupied..with. the thought that his. disco-.
as not contented himself with the chlorate m
fcalcium, notwithstn ding its great cheap- o
ess, but he has analyzed the sea water tI
-om the pits of 'the salt works, which is
rithout value, and by so doing has obtain
d therefrom all the qualities necessary to
is purpose. The (ifferent woods prepar- o
d by his saline solutions preserve their a
exibility, even after several years expo- ti
tire to the air; and thin sheets of this b
rood were twisted into spirals, first in one F
irection and then in the contrary one, p
rithout their suffering the slightest fracture e
r injury of a.ny kind. Exposed to the air is
iese thin pieces were neither splitorother- i%
'ise inijured horwcver dry they became: "
nd, finally, they were so far incombusti- tl
le as to be incapable of sustaining or pro- %
agating conflagration. h
"To these highly useful properties, which p
le constructors ofships, bi idges, d wellings, p
:a , will readily appreciate, and turn to 11
rofit, the author ha'joined others, less im- a
orant, certainly, but still new, and not p
rithout interest, in the arts. Ile colors "
roods in clonds so varied and casual as to ti
rornise much utility, by the employment a:
f his method in ornamenting the most or- Ii
inary woods, so as to fit them for the fab- tt
cation offurniture, and for other purposes 'a
fornamental use.a
" The specimetns of this kind. now lbe- ei
re the Academy, relieve us from all de- it
tills upon this head; and it thorefure sufli- q
es for us to say: a
" That the pyrolignite of iron, alone, a
ives a very beautiful brown tint ; t
" That by causing tannin to be absor- si
edl by the tree, after the pyrolignite of d
on, the mnassofthe tree is rendered black, tI
'hile some portions exhibit tints of blue, s'
lack and gray ; p
" That by imroducing, first, the pyrolig- ?
ite of iron, and afterwvards the prusiate of
'otassa, a fine Prussiatn blue is produced ;
" That by introdtucing, successively, the p
cetate of lead and the chromain of potassa, C.
lemon, or chromate of lead color is produ- sa
cd;
" That by introducing into the same t<
runk, the pyrolignite of iron, prussiate,b
nd. acet ate of lead, and chromate of potas
a, the whole wvood assumes a series of
louds of blue, green, yellow and brown,
rhich collectively produce the most varied g
nd pleasing effect. s
" The colors and shades may be varied -
ilmost to infitnity, according to taste or F
ancy ; as chymnistry is sulficiently rich, in C
Lgents ofthis nature, to satisfy the wants, ~
mnd even the caprices, ofthe most faqtidious.
I We have said nothing here, of the com
ntunication of odors to woods, by impreg
tations of this kind, because this is an gp.
>lication easily cornprehended without ex- I
>lanation ; arnd also because it is too strict
y limited to the demands of luxury to be I
placed in the same scale of importance I
with the valuable results which we have
above enumerated.
"IL is evident, from the bare announce
meat of all these results, that they have i
not been, and never coulid be, the result of
accidental discovery. The author has de
duced them fronm simple ideas; and they
are the fruit of long continued and labori.
ous studies and experiments."
The commission closed their labors *lth -
a recommendation that a copy of their ce
port he transmitted to the ministers of ag
rictilture anti commerce, of the publid
works and the marine, of finances and of'
war, which recommendation was adopted
by the Academy.
At a subsequent sitting of the Academy,
that body received notice from The minis
ters of war and of fluance, that they had
recommended the method of Dr. Bouche
rie to the special attention of the commis
