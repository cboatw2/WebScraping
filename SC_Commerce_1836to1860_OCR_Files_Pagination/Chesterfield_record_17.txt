in every view of the subject, therefore, it
*> ^ does appear to me, that, although there certainty
is, in the present condition of the country
in relation to it, sufficient to exercise tho
most serious attention, there is nothing in tho
sfato of public opinion m the United States,
to jQstify that panic in the public mind which
invariably disqualifies those who partake of
it, from dealing wisely or successfully with
the circumstances by which it is produced.

will be made to understand our real condition

the uncliangcable law of that condition is,
that the slave question must be left to the
control of the slave holding States themselves,
without molestation or interference
from any quarter; that foreign interference
of every description, can only be injurious
to the slave, without benefit to any interest, j

The deep interest which is at stake upon

Mr. Stevenson's Appointment.
We have already stated tliat the Senate,
which remained in s. cret session on Wednesday
until a. very late hour, confirmed the
nomination of Mr. Stevenson uf Minister
to England. It appears by the vote that
greater opposition was made to his nomination
at this .session. In the absence of
Mr. Leigii, Mr. Webster, and Mr, Kent,
all opposed to the nomination, there were
still nineteen Senators voting against it.
The injunction of secrecy having been
taken otf from the vote, and the report of
the Committee on Eyeign Relations, we
publish the latter, ill our paper to-day, to
show the groundson which the minority arc
presumed to have voted.

K> .\ x Hi
March 3, 1S3G.
Mr Clay, from the Committee en Foreign
Relations, submitted the following report:.
The Committee on Foreign Relations, to
whom was referred the nomination of
Andrew Stevenson, of Virginia, as
Minister Plenipotentiary and Envoy Extraordinary
tQ Great Britain, have according
to order, had the satiii Under consideration,
and new beg leave to report:
That, on the 30th of May, 1834, Andrew
SteKjnson was nominated for the same officcf^tifcCon
the 24th of the succeeding
Lr? 'vie hv t!ir? S(?nntC ! that
liiutiiu 11^ Iftw X'jvvvvv.
Afartixi Van Buren of New.York, had been
previously nominated for the same office,
and, on the 2oth of January, 1832, had
been rejected by the Senate; that it remained
vacant from this period until the nomination
of -Mr. Stevenson, and it has continued
vacant from the time of his rejection. This
office lias, therefore been unoccupied during
a term of more than four year?.
When Mr. Stevenson was tird nominated,
- lie was Speaker of the House of
Representatives of the U. States, which
office he resigned on the day of June,
1834. Whilst that nomination was under
consideration, it appeared to the Senate
that the Secretory of State had, on the loth
day of March, 1833, addressed an official
note to Mr. Stevenson, in which the Secretary
said: "lam directed by the. President to
?nn?JnntInIIV that as soon as
UliUMJl ^ V.Uiliuv,iuiuin | -advices
shall he received that the British
Government consent to open negotiations
with this, which are daily expected, it is his
intention to offer you the place of Minister
Plenipotentiary, to the Court of St. James;
and he requests that, should this appointmeat
be agreeable to you, you would hold
yourself in readiness to embark in the
course of the summer. I congratulate
you, sir, on this mark of the President's
confidence." This note was 'received by
Mr. Stevenson; but, if he returned a direct
answer, it did not appear to the Senate.
Snbsequent to the receipt of this note, in
April, 1833, Mr. Stevenson was elected a
member of the House of "Representatives
from the State of Virginia, took his scat at
the commencement of the session of Congress
in the December following, was
elected speaker of the House, and continued
to discharge the duties" of that otfieo until
he resigned'it, as herein before stated.
It appeared further to the Senate that,
shortly after Mr. Stevenson received the
note of the Secretary of State before mentioned,
he had an interview and consultation
with Mr. Thomas Ritchie, his friend and
neighbor, and the editor of a leading newspaper
supporting the Administration, published
at Richmond, in Virginia, on the
subject of the contents of that note. In
that .interview, Mr. Ritchie, in a letter
addressed to Mr. Stevenson, in June, 183-1
says, it struck him that the President might
appoint Mr. Stevenson, in case the contingency,
happened during the recess, and
not send him, but Mr. Livingston to
France. " I suggested (says he) that these
appointments ought not, and could not bo
matje, according to the spirit of the Constitution,
during the recess of the Senate.
Yon (Mr. Stevenson) promptly and cordially
concurred in this view of the subject,
and I then determined to write to a
friend in Washington, for the purpose of
laying this view before the President himself.
You approved of my doing so; and,
in fact, we agreed perfectly, in the course to
be taken. We determined to take no
notice of Mr. Livingston's letter, to act
yourself as if no such letter had been
written; that it would be best not to offer to
accept the appointment if made in the summer,
and to wait the action of the Senate."
&c.
In pursuance of the plan thus arranged
between Mr. Stevenson, and Mr. Ritchie,
the latter, in JVfarch, 183?, {"'dressed two
letters to Mr, W. B. feewis, at the City of
Washington, who was the friend and enjoyed
the confidence of the President, and
held the office of Auditor. Extracts from
these letters were furnished by Mr. Lewis,
and pfesonted to tie Senate cntfle occasion
they have misapprehended the true bearings
of this question. Instead of accusing our
countrymen, w ho hoid property in slaves,
with disregarding the general principles of!
liberty and the dictates of a pure religion,
they will recognize, in this class of our citizens,
as sincere friends to the happiness of
jnankind as any others, "and h ill become
sensible that this species of property, the result
of causes over which they had ho control,
is an inheritance wliich Viey only know
jiow to dispose of. Instead of charging
4.he people of the non-slave holding State?,
as have often been done, with hypocrisy,
in professing an ardent love of freedom, they
will find that the free citizens of the North
are only acting upon the principles of fidelity
to the most solemn engagements; that if
they were to attempt the accomplishment of
what is desired of them by those who rc- |
gard slavery as inconsistent with the equal
ri<rhts on which our institutions arc founded,
-o t - - . (
they will involve themselves in thc*odium,;
either of seeking to evade a compact which j
was the means and the pledge of our nation- J
al existence, or of availing themselves ofj
their present power and unexampled pros- j
peritv, to dissolve a connection with their
Southern brethren, formed at a period of j
mutual adversity, for a cause which was
r then not only known to exist, but the con-*
trnuancc of which was expressly recognized
in the bond of their Union.
I have thus, gentlemen, been compelled
" to extend rav remarks considerably furtlier
than I intcadcd, when I commenced to ;
answer your enquiry. As, however, tha!
subject was delicatcLand important, I feel j
" that I have not trespassed farther upon your ;
time in its examination, than was -proper
to enable you to comprehend the views 1
entertain of it, or than was respectful to the ;
considerations which justified your call for ;
'i"-A A?vlT f?*?J ns?;iired. whatever
V/ A . ,
! of tlic first nomination of Air. Stevenson. <
Air. Ritchie says to Mr. Lewis " I tun [
about to adilrcss you on a subject which j
hns caused much speculation among our ?
friends, mid great uneasiness in my bosom. |
I speak to a you as a friend, and without j i
the slightest reserve. The papers have j i
recently spoken of a bach of appointments, j
which the President is about to make,!
embracing the two highest missions to i
European courts, and the two highest scats j
in his cabinet. I have comerscd freely i
with our friend Stevenson upon them, and 1
have this djiy communicated to him my !
intention to write to you, and to lay before j
you my own views of the matter.
" We have the utmost confidence in the j
virtue of Gen. Jackson. We have no idea i
that ho would arrogate to himself new j
powers, at the expense of tho other depart
fini-orniriOMt. His creneroUS (
ambition lias boon fully satisfied ! He has j
nothing more to ask of his country than her
verdict of approbation when he lays down
the high and difficult oflico with which he
is intrusted! W o ail know it, and every
candid individual admits it! W'c believe
that the course he may pursue will ho with
a single eye to the pybiic interest. Hut
whilst we dismiss all apprehensions that lie
v.Hl dcsignoldy abuse his authority, we
wish, at the same time, that he should do tkT
act whicn may be plead, hereafter, by an
unworthy successor, in justification of his
acts. In this lost term of his Administration,
we wish to sec no precedent act, which may
he perverted in future times; we desire it on
J our own account as well as that of our
country. W'c wish to see his Adminislra?

country benefited, in all time to come, by his
pure example. Hut this cannot be, if any
error should be committed against principle,
even from the best of motives; if any
authority should be assumed which does not
fairly belong to him, or even if any doubtful
power should be exercised upon any delicate
branch of the Constitution, his higli popularity
would only make it more current.
One of the highest powers which attaches to
the Executive is that of appointment; over
its exercise is accordingly thrown; and
wisely thrown, t!>e check of concurrence by
the Senate. Now, sir, doubts do exist
whether the vacancy in the missions to I
London and Paris did not originally occur
during the recess of the Senate. Secondly,
whether the vacancy docs not still exist:
and thirdly, whether it ought now to be
filled without a consultation with the Senate,"
The letters from which these extracts J
were taken, having been written expressly!
with a view of being laid before the President, j
there can be no doubt that it was done. !
Their main object, that of preventing the r
appointment of Mr. Stevenson in the vnca-;
tion of the Senate, was secured, The;
President foreborc to make it, and waited ;
until the Senate assembled at the ensuing ;
session before the nomination was made.

of the 13th June, 1834, communicating the
note ofthc Secretary ofStatc to Mr. Steven,
son, that the negotiations to which it refers j
were commenced early in April, 1933, in j
the city of Washington instead of London,
and as they have been since conducted here, I
no further communication was made to Mr. j
Stevenson- What these negotiattons were i
has not been stated. Whatever they might I
have beon, the residence of a minister of j
the United States at London, at all times, is
obviously proper; and that the appointment
of Mr. Stevenson did not depend upon any ;
particular negotiations, is manifest from the :
th ct of his having been finally nominated to ;
Tfthiv-Provident had abandoned I
| II At t*iv . ~ ,
all intention of sending him to England inas-!
much as he had been requested to hold him. j
self in readines to go, during the summer!
of 1833, and had not declined the offer, lie |
would probably have been notified of tlie |
change in the views of the President.
The Senate saw, therefore, that a promisc
of the mission to Great Britain had been
communicated to Mr. Stevenson on the 15th
March, 1833. They saw an indirecct intervention,
with Mr. Stevenson's knowledge
and ac.quicsence, to prevail on the Presi.
dent not to make the appointment in the
vacation of the Senate, in accommodation
to the views of Mr. Stevenson and his friend
Mr. Ritchie. They saw that the President
did forbear to make the appointment in vacation
of the Senate. And they Saw the
final execution of the pomise, as far as it
depended upon the Executive, by bis nomma'ion
on the 30th May, 1834. During
the long interval, he had been elected by the
people of a congressional district in Virginia
as their representative, ignorant of his having
possession of such an official pomise ;
1 ? >.i i? j;, :
Uc had Dccu eiectcu, unuer uiu iuw igmjrance,
by the House of Representatives, as
their Speaker; and, in that station, had perfoemeb
all the highly important duties incident
to it. That office, at all times one of
great influence, possessed more than ordinary
weight in the session of 1833-'4. The
President, some time before its commencement,
directed the public deposites to be
withdrawn from the Bank of the United
States, and placed in the local banks. That
measure excited deep and general sensation
throughout the country ; divided the People
; divided constitutional advisers of the
President; divided Congress, and became
a subject of warm and animated discussion
in both Houses. It was at this cxtraordinary
period, that the Speaker of the House
of Representees, invested with the power of
appointing and arranging the committees of
the House, and wielding a great influence
secretly held a written official promise of
the most important mission abroad, every
body being ignorant of the fact except himself,
the President, the Secretary of State,
and a few confidential friends.
It was under these circumstances that his
nomination came up for consideration in the
Senate. It is a fundamental principle of <
free Governments that in order to preserve
the purity of their administration, each of
the three departments into which, according j1
to all safe maxims, they are divided, should ! <
be kept independent of and without the in-! i
Alienee of tho others. Bui, if the head of ';
one of those departments may at a critica'
[>criod, confidentially present, and for a long
period of time hold up to the presiding officer
of the-popular liranch of another the
powerful inducement of a splendid foreign
mission, is there not imminent danger of undue
subserviency ? of a failure of that prosiding
officer faithfully and independently to
discharge the liigh duties of his exalted station
?
The Senate thought tlftrc was, and withheld
its advice and consent to tlie nomination
ot .Mr. Stevenson as minister to Great
Britain. And now, afu r a lapes of near
two years, with all the circumstances by
which h:s original nomination was attended,
remaining in full force, but with considcrahie
individual variations in the composilion
of the Senate, the same individual is
again nominated by the President for the
same office. Doubtless a place, more than
any other foreign appointment, important
to he constant occupied, has not been kept
vacant with a view to or in expectation ofany
such variations. Doubtless, in the ample
/I..1.1 1 ? " ? flirt irttnllin/tn/in on.I
JIUIU IUI SVIl'Cllim mu IIU(;|||"VII^U UII'.I
patriotism of near fifteen millions of People
offer, some individual equally well qualified
with, and less exceptionable than Mr. Ste.
venson, might be designated to represent the
United States at the Court of St. James.
Doubtless no personal feelings or wishes to
achieve a triumph over the Senate can have
prompted the renewal of this nomination.
Whatever may have been its motives, the
committee neither know nor have any thing
to do with them. They are not themselves
aware of an peculiar fitness in Mr. Stevenson,
or any absolute necessity of deputing
him, and only him, as the minister of the
United Slates to Great Britain. In ordinary
times, the fact of his being unacceptable
to a large portion of the Senate, even if that
did not constitute an aGtual majority, would
be regarded as deserving of consideration.
In a" free Government it should bo the aim
of those who administer it to promote harmony
in the public councils, and satisfaction
among the People.
The Senate of the United States is supposed,
by the theory of the Constitution, to
be as free and independent in the exercise of
its judgment on nominations submitted to its
consideration, as the President is in proposingthem.
liach of the two components
of the appointing power acts upon its own
sense of duty, and upon its own responsibility.
The Senate has no right to require
the President to nominate any particular individual?
and the President has no right to
require the Senate to confirm any particular
nomination. When the Senate lias
once decided upon a nomination, there ought
to be an end of the matter.
Prior to the present Administration, instances
of renominatiou were rare, and are
believed to have occurred only when some
indication was given from the Senate of a
desire that it should take place. It has of
late become much more frequent. The
practice is liable to great abuses. A Pres.
ident disposed to advance favorites to public
offices, and finding a Senate disagreeing
with him as to their fitness, may forebear,
for a long time, to the detriment of the public
service, to nominate tiny person to fill
i.fti-rt until, fmm those chances of individ
V,M4"7 ^ C?
ual memljers to which all collective bodies
are liable, a Senate happens to be formed
more yielding and complying. When a
nomination is once rejected, the exact state
of the vote of the Senate is known to the
President; and if the practice of renomination
is indulged, in process of time there
will be danger of the existence or the imputation
of corruption. The committee think
that the practice ought to be resisted; that
when the Senate has once rejected an indiviual
nomination, the decision ought to be
held as final and conclusive; and that it ought
not to confirm trie nomination of the same
person when again made for the same office,
without strong special cause. In the present
case, no such cause is alleged or known
to exist; whilst all the considerations which
formerly opposed the cofirmation _ of Mr.
Stevenson continue in unabated strength.
The committee, therefore, recommend the
adoption of the following resolution.
Resolved, That the Senate do not advise
and consent to the appointment of Andrew
Stevenson as Minister Plenipotentiary and

and several, others, followed immediately

led?that the commanding officer of tlic de
tachment deeming, it is presumed, the In
dians too strong, ordered a retreat. In the
absence of certain information, wcgire thu
report as received, and regret much that wc
arc deprived of any means of obtaining anj
! information which can be implicitly relied
J upon; the Jacksonville Courier, to which pa.
per we generally look for information, not
having been issued when the Florida left on
Wednesday last.
The Steam Boat Santec was, we understand,
also fired upon last week by Indians,
between Volusia and Picolata?but no damage
was sustained.
Wc also learn that Gen. Scott, with about
2200 men, had proceeded on Saturday last
from Fort Dranc for the Withlacoochoe,
where if he met the Indians, a severe battle,
which may prqbably terminate the war,
would ensue. If not found there, it was the
intention of the gallant General to proceed
with his forces into the nation. His march
is therefore full of interest, and wc must be
satisfied to remaiu in painful anxiety for our
patriotic army, until we can ascertain the
result of their manoeuvres.
