The condition of the Treasury is tb?*
chief arid the most interesting topic of discu^sion
here. The deficit reported, today,
is near seven hundred thousand dol- \
lars, and it must increase. Treasury I
notes will no longer answer their purpose I
of postponing government debt. They I
are below the par of specie and are re- <
fused. The drafts for the quarterly pay. I

onid. Some members have taken the I
.Speaker's checks and negotiated them <
wjth banks or brokers for current finds, s

"THB BRITtKRY BILL." - .
We copy iJiB /oliowing from the South
Carolinian of Inst week:
"From the Cheraw Gazette.
uWo learn fiom different eonrces entitled
to 'credit, that while the Legislature
of South Carolina was passing a bill
and resolutions to prohibit the State from
receiving its.share of the money, there
was, at the sam * time, au understanding
among the meinhers, that if the other
slates should receive their respective
shares. South Carolina would, in that
case, take hers also, and risk the subsidising
influence of the * bribe.' "
This poor attempt to belittle the noble
action of this State on the vile " Bribery
Bill," is a rank slander upon the Legislatare,
and the People, and, so far as we
-know or believe, alter daily intercourse
t with *!* the. members," during the entire
f session,, totally .destitute of foundation.
1 ? . : . ... l :i
i ^y.eaoJemnlv declare, mai we never n?nrn
[ if single member intimate (he least dr.
Uire, or willingness, that South Carolina
should hereafter receive anV portion allotted:
to her, or recede in the slightest
degree from the position she has taken,
let the course of "(lie other States" be
what it may."
Our information was derived from gefl.
\tlemen entitled to implicit credence ; who
| held nt least as much "daily intercourse
i with Mhe members,'* during the entire
session", as the editor of the Carolinian
could have held; and who were not less
likely to henr what was said, 01 know
what was intended. The Columbia edi.
j tor's testimony is negative, theirs positive,
and both doubtless true.
If "the nolde action of thisS'ate on the
vile * Bribery bill,'" is itself big, its
friends need not distress themselves with
apprehensions that shedding upon it a few
rays qf the'light of truth can *beli/tU" it
very mucin*
Our languago secnts to he mi*interpre.
ted by the Carolinian. The information
which we received, and which we intend,
ed to convey to others was, not that the
course of* otJier Sf/Jtts should be looked
to in a guide for South Carolina ; but
that the aim was to influence Congress,
with a new. of prircuring the repeal of the
distribution act; if this could not be done,
and the oolicv of distribution should he
persisted in, and distribution should ac.
tually be made among the other States,
then, South Carolinn would receive hci
share. We are not to be understood ,v
saying there was any formal expressior
of opinion on this |>oint. nor that the opin
ion was universal; hut only as conveying
the impression made upon the minds ol
our informants, by casual intercourse with
the members of the Legislature.
We stated a few weeks ago that fhi
resolutions introduced into the House o
Representatives of this state at the lati
session, a (Brining the right of the Logia
lature to instruct the Senators of the stall
Jut Congress, were aimed at Col. Pkks
tout. The South Carolinian denies thn
ffiev were thus aiintd; nnd we see. hi
looking J^lhq resolutions themselves, thai
the end e/urosly avowed was to wari
Senators to fx* elected in future, that th<
State iu?i?is upon .'he right of instruction
The resolutions ernhedy a curious medlei
