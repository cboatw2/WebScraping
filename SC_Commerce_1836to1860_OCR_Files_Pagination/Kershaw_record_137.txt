in their ordinary affairs, is, in my iudg?
ment, to view it in a very erroneous light.
The Constitution prohibits the States from
making any thing but gold and silver a
tender in the payment of debts, and thu?
secures to every citizen a riff hi to demaud
payment in the legal currency. To provide
by law that the Government will only
receive its dues in gold and silver, is not
to confer on it any peculiar privilege; but
merely to place it on an equality with the
itilivan htr rnaavvinw M * a
vi9wj ivovi v?iij tu ii q n^ui secured
to him by the Constitution. It is doubtless
for this reason that the principle has
been sanctioned by successive laws, from
the time of the first Congress under the
Constitution down to the last. Sueh
precedents, never objected to and proceeding
from such sources, afford a decisive
answer to the imputation of inequality
or injustice.
But, in fact, the measure ia one of re-striction,
not of favor. To forbid the
.public ageat to receive in * pay nient any
other than a certain kind of money, is
'to refuse him a discretion possessed by
every citizen. It may be left to those
who have the management ot their otvn
transactions, to inake their own terms;
but no such discretion should be given to
him who acts merely as an agent of the
people, who is to collect what the law
requires, and to pay the appropriations
it makes. When bank notes are redeem
ed on demand, there is then no disrrimi
nation in reality, for the individual who
receives them may, at his option, substitute
the specie for them; he tukes them
from convenience or choice. When they
are not so redeemed, it will scarcely he
contended that their receipt and payment
by a public officer, should be permitted,
though none deny that right to an individual
; if it were, the effect would be
most injurious to the public, since their
officer could make none of those arrangements
to meet or guard against the depre
u __
viuuuu, wurcii an uiuiviuuui is at liberty
to do. Nor cnn inconvenience to the
community be alleged as an objection to
such a regulation lis object and motive
are their convenience arid welfare.
If, at a moment of simultaneous and
unexpected suspension by the banks, it
adds sonlething to the many embarrassments
of that proceeding, yet these are
far overbalanced by its direct tendency to
produce a wider circulation of gold and
silver, to increase the safety of bank paper,
to improve the general currency, ami
thus to prevent altogether suoh occurrences,
and the other and far greater evils
that attend them.
It may, indeed, he questioned, whether
:? r,?- : < -?
>v 13 nut mi vim imcrPSl 01 me uanKs
themselves tiiat the Government should
not receive their paper. They would be
conducted with more caution, and on
sounder principles. By using specie only
in its transactions, the Government would
create a demand for it, which would, t a
great extent, prevent its exportation, and
by keeping it in circulation, maintain a
a broader and safer basis for the paper
currency. That the banks would thus be
rendered more sound, and the community
more safe, cannot admit of a doubt.
The foregoing views, it seems to me, !
do but fairly carry out the provisions of
the Federal Constitution in relation to the
currency, as far as relates to the | ublic
revenue. At lire time that instrument
was framed, there were but three or four
banks in the United States; and had the
a r -1. 1
extension 01 me numting system, and tiie
evils growi g out of it, been foreseen,
they would probably have been specially
guarded against. The same policy which
led to the prohibition of bills of credit by
the States, would doubtless, in that event, i
have also interdicted their issue as a currency
in any other form. The Constitution,
however, contains no such prohibition
; and, since the States have exercised
for nearly half a century the power to regulate
the business of banking, it is not
to be expected that it will be abandoned.
The whole matter is now under discussion
before the proper tribunal?the people of
the States. Never before has the public
mind been so thoroughly awakened to a
proper sense of its importance; never has
the subject, in ail its hearings, been submitted
to so searching an inquiry. It
would be distrusting the intelligence and
virtue of the people to doubt the speedy
and efficient adoption of such measures
of reform as the public good demands.
All that can rightfully he done by the
Federal Government, to promote the accomplishment
of that important object,
will, without doubt, be performed*
in tne mean tunc, It is our duly to provide
all the remedies against a depreciated
paper currency which the Constitution
enables us to afford The Treasury Department,
on several former occasions,
has suggested the propriety and importance
of a uniform law concerning bankruptcies
of corporation^, and other hankers.
Through the instrumentality of such
a law, a salutary check may doubtless be
imposed 011 the issues of paper money,
and an effectual remedy given to the citl-'
zen in a way at once equal in alt parts of1,
the Union, and fully authorized by the!
Constitution.
The indulgence granted by Executive
authority in the payment of bonds for du-1
ties, has been already mentioned. Seeinv
that the immediate enforcement of these
obligations would subject a large and high-.
)y respectable portion of our citizens to
great sacrifices, and believing that a tem-l
porary postponement could be made without
detriment to other interests, and with
increased certainty of iiltiinute payment,
I did not hesitate to comply with the request
that was made of me. The terms'
allowed, are, to the full extent, as liberal1
as any that are to be found in the practice
. of the Executive Department. It remain*
i for Congress to decide whether a further
i postponement may not with propriety be
i allowed, and, if so, their legislation upon
! the subject is respectfully invited.
The report of the Secretary of the
Treasury will exhibit the condition of
these debts ; the extent and effect of the
present indulgence; the probable result
of its further extension on the state of the
Treasury, and every other' fact necessary
to a full consideration of the subject.?
i Similar information is communicated in
j reirard to such deoositoriea of th? nhMi?
? . -- r-",,v
moneys as are indebted to the Government,
in order that Coqgress may <ilso
adopt the proper measures in regard ft0
them.
The receipts and expenditures for the
first half of the year, and an estimate of
those for the residue, will be laid before
you by the Secretary of the Treasury.
In his report of December last, it was estimated
thai the current receipts would
fall short of the expenditures by about
three millions of dollars. It will be seen
that the difference will be much greater.
! This is to be attributed not only to the
' occurrence of greater pecuniary embarrassments
in the business oi the country
than tho?c which were then predicted, and
consequently, a greater diminution in the
revenue, but also to Hire fact that the appropriations
exceeded, by nearly six millions,
the nmount-which was askod for in
the estimates then submitted. The sum
necpssary for the service of the year beyond
the probable receipts, and the amount
which it uriifl inlon/lo'l "! '?1 -1 1? 1
? .. ..?. ....vnu?u biiuuiu uc reservea
in the Treasury at the commencement of
the year, will be about six millions. If
the whole of the reserved balance be not
at once applied t?> the current expenditures,
but four millions be still kept in the
Treasury, as seeins most expedient for
the uses of the mint, and to meet contingencies,
the sum needed will bo ten
rni'lions.
In making this estimate, the receipts
are calculated on the supposition of some
further extension of the indulgence granted
in the pavment of bonds for duties,
which will affect the amount of the revenue
for the present year to the extent of
two and a half millions.
It is not proposed to procure the required
amount bv loans or increased taxation.
There are now in the Treasury nine millions
three hundred.and sixty-seven thousand
two hundred and fourteen dollars
directed by the act of the 23d of June,
I83C, to be deposited with the States in
October next. This sum, if so deposited
will be subject, under the law, to be recalled,
if needed, to defray existing appropriations;
anil as it is now evident
that the whole, or the principal part of
it, will be wanted for that purpose, it appears
most proper thai the depositc should
be withheld. Until the amount can be
collected frotn the banks. Treasury notes
may be temporal ily issued, to be gradually
redeemed as it is received.
I am aware that this course may be
productive of inconvenience to many of
the States. Relying upon the acts of
Congress which held out to tlioin the
strong probability, if not tlie certainty,
ot receiving this instalment, they have in
some instances adopted measures with
which ilis retention may seriously inter I
Cere. That such a condition of things
should have occurred is much to lie re-1
gretted. It is not the least among the
unfortunate results of the disasters of the
times ; and it is for Congress to devise a
fit rerned'*, if there be ??ne. The money
being indispensable to the wants of the
Treasury, it is difficult to conceive upon
what principle of justico or expediency
its application to that object can be avoided.
To recall any portions of the sums'
already deposited wilii the States, would
be more inconvenient and less efficient.
To burden the country with increased
taxation, when there is in fact a large sur-'
plus revenue, would be unjust and unwise;
to raise moneys by loans under such circutnsiaiices,
and thus to commence a new
national debt, would scarcely be sanctioned
by the American people.
The plan proposed will he adequate to
all our fiscal operations, during the remainder
of the year. Should it be adopted
the Treasury, aided by the ample resour*
ccs of the country, will he able to dis
charge, punctually, every pecuniary obligate
'ii. For the future, all that is needed
will be that caution and forbearance in
appropriations woich the diminution of
the revenue requires, and which the complete
accomplishment of great forwardness
of many expensive national undertakings
renders equally consistent with prudence
and patriotic liberality.
The preceding suggestions and recommendations
are submitted, in the belief
that their adoption by Congress will enable
the Executive Department to conduct
our fiscal concerns with success, so far as
their management has been committed to
it. Whilst the objects and the means
proposed to attain them are within its
constitutional powers and appropriate
duties, they will al the same time, it is
hoped, by th"ir necessary operation, afford
essential aid in the transaction of individual
concerns, and thus yield relief to the
people at latge in a form adapted to the
nature of our Government. Those who
look to the action of this Government for
specific aid to the citizen to relieve embarrassments
arising from losses by revulsions
in commerce and credit, lose sight'
of the ends for which it was created, and.
the powers with which it is clothed. It(
was established to give security to us all, i
in our lawful and honorable pursuits, under 1
the lasting safeguard of republican insti
* , *4
I tutions. It vii not intended to confer
special favors on individuals, or on any
classes of them; to create systems of
agriculture, manfaetures, or trade; or to
engage in thorn, either separately or in
connection- with individual citizens or
organized associations. If its operations
were to be directed for the benefit of any
one class, equivalent favors roust, in
justice, t>e Attended to the rest1; and the
attempt to bestow such favors with an
equal hand, or even to select those who.
should most deserve them, would never
be successful. AH communities are ant :
to look to Government for too much. ,
Even in our own country, where its pow- <
era and duties are so strictly limited, we i
are protfe to do so, especially at periods
of sudden embarrassment and distress. (
But this ought not to be. The framcrs oi
our excellent Constitution, and the people
who approved ft with calm and saga- ,
cious deliberation, acted at the time on a ;
sounder principle. They wisely judged
iL.i -1 I d"% ' - e ?
mat me less uorernmem interferes with
private pursuits, the better for the general <
prosperity. It is not its legitimate object <
to make men rich, or to repair, by direct <
grants of money or legislation in favor of <
particular pursuits, losses not incurred in
the public service. This would be substantially
to use the property of so ><e lor <
the benefit of others. Bui its real duty? <
that duty, the performance of which makes ?
a good Government the most prations of
human blessings?is to enuct and enforce
a system of general laws commensurate 1
with, but not exceeding, the objects of its 1
establishment, and to leave every citizen l
and every interest to reap, under its be- <
nign protection, the rewards of virtue, in- *
dustry and prudence.
1 cannot doubt that on this, as on all similar I
occasions, tho Federal Government will find its
agency most couducive to the security and huppiness
ol the people, when limited to the exercise <>f
its conceded powers In never assumi. g, even
for a well meant object, Wucn powers as were not
designed to be confe red upon it, we shall in reality
do moat for the general welfare. To avoid ev? ry
unnecessary interference with the pursuits of th<
citi/.en, will result n more benefit than to ad <pl
measures which could nly assist limited interests,
and are eagerly, but perhaps natur liy sought for.
under the pressure of temporary ciicuiuslances.
If, therefore, 1 refrain from suggesting to Congress
any specific plan for regulating the exchan
ges of the country ; relieving mercantile embarrassments
; or interfering with the ordinary operations
-of foreign or domestic commerce; it is from ,
a conviction that such measures are not within th
constitutional province of the General Govern
j inent, and that their adoption would not promote I
the real and pemianenl welfare of those they might
j be designed to aid.
I The difficulties and distresses of the times, tho'. 1
unquestionably great, are limited in their extent, {
and cannot be regarded as affecting the permanent
prosperity of the nation. Arising, in a great 1
degree, from the transactions of-foreign and do- ,
mestic commerce, it is upon them that they have
chiefly fallen. The great agricultural interest has,
in many parts of the country suffered comparatively |
little; and, as if Providertce intended to display the (
munificence of its goodness at the luumeat of our
greatest need, and in direct contrast to the evils '
occasioned by the waywardness of man, we have
I been blessed throughout our extended territory
| with a season of general health and of uncommon
fruilfulness. The proceeds of our great staples
will soon furnish the means of liquidating debts at
home and abroad, and contribute equally to the
revival of coirimercial activity, and the restoration
of commercial credit. The banks, established
avowedly for its support, deriving their profits from
it, and resting under obligations to it which can- *'
not be overlooked, will feef at once the necessity j
and justice of uniting their energies with those of' (
the mercantile interest. The suspension of specie
payments, at such a time and under such circUm-1
stances as-we have lately witnessed, could not he f
other than a temporary measure; and we can I
scarcely err in believing that the period must soon J (
arrive when qll that are solvent will redeem their | .
issues in gold and silver. Dealings abroad natu- j
rally depend on resources and prosperity at home. ' 1
1 r I h<> Hphl nf nnr niArchnnln ltn? uppnmiilnla/l a?
their credit is impaired, these are fluctuations al- |
ways incident to extensive or extravagant mercan- ' .
tile transactions. But the ultimate security ofsuch
obligations does not admit of question ? '
They are guarantied by the resources of a country, 1
the fruits of whose industry alFord abundant means (
of ample liquidation, and by the evident interest
bf every merchant to sustain a credit, hitherto '
high, by promptly applying these means for its t
preservation.
I deeply regret that events have occurred which t
require me to ask your consideration of such serious
topics. I could have wished that, in making
my first communication to the Assembled representatives
of my country, 1 had nothing to dwell I
upon but the history of her unalloyed prosperity. |
Since it is otherwise, we can only feel more deeply
the responsibility of the respective trusts that have .
been confided to us, and, under the pressure of dif- '
Acuities, unite in invoking the guidance and aid (
of the Supreme Ruler of nations, and in lnhoring (
with zealotis resolution to overcome the difficultics
by which we are enviioned
It is, under such circumstances, a high gratifica <
tion to know, by long esperience, that we act for
a people to whom the truth, however unpromising, t
can always be apoken with safety; for the trial of
whose patriotism no emergency is too severe, and '
who an* sure never to desert a public functionary ?
honestly laboring for the public good It seems t
just that they should receive, without delay, any i "
aid in their embarrassments which your deliberations
can afford. Coming directly from the midst
of them, and knowing the course of events in eve- ]
ry section of our country, from you may best be J
learned as well the extent and nature of these em- ;
barrassracnts, as the most desirable measures of
relief. i g
I am aware, however, that it is not proper to detain
you, at present, longer than may be demanded g
by the special objects for which you are convened.
To them, therefore, I have confined my communication;
and, believing it will not be your own wish !
to extend your deliberations beyond them, 1
reserve till the usual period of your annual meeting
that general information of the state of the
Union which the Constitution requires me to'give. ^
