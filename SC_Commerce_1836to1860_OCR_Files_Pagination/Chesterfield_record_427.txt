'MOBILE, SEPT. 12? I am inclined j 1
to think the growing crop will not exceed in c
in all 1,700,000 bales. One of my frienns s
last season made 490 bales, and his pros-1 1
peels were good up to the 5th inst. he now 1
ft the worm is staying by fields, and he f
will be cut off one half. If South Alabama *
turns out 300,000 bales she will do well. 1
The Crop of South Alabama being I *
150,000 bales short the quantity of Bagging "
will be 15,000 pieces less, wanted here, than
last season; so tho Bagging speculators
should look out* Prices will decline.-- 1
Planters are curtailing their orders from r
one.third to one-half." (
The the Eastern banks have pro- s<
fessed groat willingness in the work }
of resumiion; and it is to be hoped '
that, if necessary, they will now act in the (
spirit of their professions. The best under- 1
standing exists among the monied institir \
tions at Philadelphia at the present time, and |
the prospect is certainly encouraging.? 1
Our money market continues easy.

From the Newark Daily Adcerhzer. I
There was a serious disturbance at a J1
Colord People's Camp Meeting on Sunday !
we k, in Cumberland county, in this State. ?
A "number of white people, prompted by an :
idfc curiosity, collected during the day, and ?
in the evening a shuttle ensued between two <
men of the opposite colors. A posse of j
the blacks run from the camp with clubs >
and belaborad the whites. During the '
fray a quiet looker on, Richard S. Bacon, J
a young man of good character, and but i
lately married, received a blow across the
head which nearly terminated his life on
the spot; his skull was badly fractured, j
and seven distinct peices were taken out j <
the next day. Contrary to all expectations, <
we jenrn by the Bridgeton Chronicle, ot <
Saturday, ihat he is still living, and there <
4(1 seems quite a probability that be will re.
cover?It's reason had reiurned, but he i
was unable to tulk much. i
Two or three of the negroes hud been i
arrested for trial. i

The Travelling Public.?The steamboat
New H iven arrived yesterday from
New II ;iven, at the usual hour, bringing !
four hundred and ninety two passengers.?
For this enormous cargo of flesh and blood,
Uie proprietors reeeived 12j cents p?r head; |
?distance. 80 miles. Another boar, the
American Eag[e, also arrived from New |
Haven yesterday, but her number of passengers
we are unable to slate. She like,
wise charges not exceeding 12? cents fare,
and we understand it is in contemplation,
to reduce it to one cent. The next step in |
the process, we suppose, will be, to give u l,
good dinner to nil wlto patronize the bouts

extend to the New York, which leaves here ,

Punishment of French Defaulters. <
Moos. Durand, Collector of Tuxes til the I
14 District or Paris, was lately tri d before |
the Court of A**ixes of the Seine, uu the <
charge of having appropriated of ihe pub- I
lie m<?aey to his own use, or cnibezzlrd, '
thirty thouasnd francs, (six thousand doL <
lane) This officer is above sixty yours of
ag?\ and had borne an excellent character.
He appeared in Court with the decora ion |
of the Legion of Honor, which, though it |
had heon obtained by meritorious conduct, |
the Judge would not permit him to wear, <
being arraigned for crime. It appears |
that ihis embezzlement commenced in (
^ 1825. and had since been annually accu
in aiming. Too lawyers exerted themselves
to the utmost pro and con. The Ju. 1
ry brought in a verdict of guilty, and the ;
offender was sentenced to "eight years 1
hard labor in the galleys, exposition in the '
piilorv, and a lino of 4000 francs, or an *
additional twelve months imprisonment if T
the fine was not paid.'' And the Judge | N
added, **You have been wanting in honor; I 8
therefore pronounce in the name of the '
Legion of J. Honor, that you have ceased to I
be a member titereof." 1

Correspondence of the Journal of Commerce. (
Opelol'sas, Lou., Sept. 4th, 1840. c
Perhaps you have heard something a- v
bout the insurrection which was to have j
taken place iu the Parishes of Lafayette c
and St. Laodray. The plans of the iusur- {
rectiooists were had, and as usual, horrible |,
in tlse operation, eo far as I have heard.?
They have as yet hung but three of the
ringleaders. Many are arrested, and more,
1 suppose, will be hung. Two white men 1
(I suppose abolitionists.) have been impli- [
cated; they were tried and found guilty by *
circumstantial and positive testimony, but (
as the law of the state does not recognize f
slave testimony against a white, they could *
not, by a legal tribunal, be found guilty to y
suffer death, as they would have been, had 1
the testimony been admissible. *
They were, however, sentenced by Judge g
Lynch to a severe flogging, with orders to a
leave the S:ate at the peril of their lives. f

The sleeping Phenomenon.?In con. \
sequence of its being reported that this ! p
unfortunate object of public curiosity was ?
deceased, a friend of ours recently went to 1
ueignion ana maae personal enquiries, ana r
visited the house in which he still continues ?
to vegetate. His name is Thomas Bradley, c
aged 22 years, and he has had two som- i
^ niferous attacks previous to the present one. t
The first lasted but a few weeks, the sec- t
ond during a period of forty weeks! and <
the present sleep has now contiuued exact,
ly fifty4wo weeks yesterday (Friday).
He has had more nourishment administered
to him within these last three months than '
previously, and his personal appearance 1
seems improved. He has within tho last 1
mentioned period exhibited some scintilla. r
tions of returning faculties, but has again I
relapsed. During this apparrcnt approach c
M to sensation, he is stated to have uttered 1
some words; but so incoherently and indis- 1
tinctly as to be unintilhgible. He cootin- (
I
jes in the same posture as before viii re.
dining partly on his left side?with one leg
ftraight and the oiher crossed over it at
jeariy n right angle from the kme. This
incommon object has baffled the skill of
tvery medical gentlemen who has as yet
cm !iim. It i*, however, the united opinon
of the profession that if he returns to
iensition, his existence will soon terminate.

The Great Whig Meeting in Bos- ^
rov.?A correspondent of the N. Y. Jour. fi
ml commenced; in giving some account e
>f the speeches delivered says: t
Judging from what I was able to here, J
sober argument was the predominant char.
icteristic of the greater part of the speech- (
?s. The speakers felt rhat they were ad- (
Jrcssiug men who love to be amused and
sxcited, but who demanded good reasons j
ror what they are urged to believe and do. j
Tlie prevalent s'yle of address was in fact
i high compliment to the intelligence of the <
isscmbled multitude. Whether there were i
miss aiement of facts nnd sophistical arjuirvnts,
is a question on which politcians
>vill differ; but certainly there was very little
lppealJio bad passions, or advocacy of de"
* 1 .VI i _ ^ _ |
noralizirrg principles, This 1 tukc io otr
in important point, especially if the Whigs,
succeed ; for the most important influence
if any political movemen's' floes not result
"rom the change ofmen and measures which
it brings to pass, but from the principles on
which it teaches men to act. These are |
permanent, and bear fruit in succeeding (
generations.
Machine Composition in Printing.?
A German journal states, that M. do Kieglor,
of Pesth, h is invented a mnchine for
composition in printing, which effects an
entire revolution in that art. The machine, )
which is of an octagon form, has as many
divisions as there ore letters in the alphabet, (
^nd on pressure the letters fall out and tuke
'heir places in the required order. The
composition goes on, it is said, with such
rapidity, that a single workman can composo
the matter for a large sheet in less than an
hour and a half. The distribution of the
type when done with is said to be carried on
wi ll still greater speed and facility. A cylinder
is turned, and the letters are restored
in regular order to the divisions from which
they were taken. It is asserted that a large
sheet and a half of type may be thus distributed
in one hour. The journal from which
we tjke this account says that the process
lias been witnessed by the University of
Pesth ; and that the Russi an Ambassador at
Vienna, having heard of the invention and
received the particulars of it, immediately
ordered a muchine for the Emperor Nicholas.
VVe give this extraordinary statement
is we find it, and must wait for farther acconnts
before we can give entire credit to
if, for the mode of distribution alluded to
surprises us even more than tho composition.
Something of the kind was attempted in i
England a great many years ago, and com- ,
detely failed.
Domestic Writing Paper.?We have in (

Rebecca S tuudcrs was found dead in her

convinced that she came to her death by Intemperance,
and accordingly gave their ver- '

New description of Cotton.?A new
speeies of Cotton has been discovered by (
Mr. L. C. Hornsby, ofCovington, La. He <
?ays the bush grows from 8 to 10 feet high, |
irnnching out in proportion, and producing .
rorr. twp to three thousand pounds to the '
icreV This Cotton is of long staple, and '
'cry fine textnro. Hornsby thinks it as fine
is ordinary silk. He says one seed was
bund two years s'nee in a chest of tea, im- I
>ortcd from China; he planted it, and suved t,
lie seed which wns its production, planted
hem, and now ofFers a few for sale. If this
otton proves as good as represented, we c
:an th?m count upon a new era in the cultL t
ation of the great staple. We think at c
east some attention should be paid to it by |
ur planters. They will see a specimen
ho Conon, and its seed, at the store of Wil- n
lam Dinn, Esq. 17 Common street. <'

from Washington addresses Inrge Whig
meetings in the towns through which he
passes, on the presidential election.
Maine Election.?Complete returns
have not yet come to hand. It is certain
the Whigs huve elected four members of
Congress, two of them in place of Van Burcn
men, and the Administration party two.
In two districts no choice has been made, a
majority of all the votes cast being necessary.
In one of these dis'rictsilie adminfetrn.
lion party seem to be the strongest, and in
the other the Whigs. The Whigs have n
majority in the Senate, apme accounts say r
jf 7 or 8, and others, "the whole number
?f the body b?*ing 25. To the-.House of
Representatives, wh ich consists of 180
? . *' 9%
members, 94 an? ascertained to liave boen
jiected by the Whigs, and 60 by the other
5artv. In 18 or 20 districts, no choice;
and a few not hoard from. The Whig
presses claim for Kent their candidate for
Governor a small majority of nil the votes
3as'; whereas some of the popcrs.on the
other tide claim for Fairfield, their candidate,
a plurality but not a majority. In
t;ither case, Kent must be the Governor;
for, according to the constitution of that
jtate, when no person receives a majority
jf the popular votes, the Hovte elects two
)ut of the four receiving the greatest'num.,
jer of votes; and the Senate one of these
wo. The result of the election is different
rom what either party expected.
It is a little amusing to witness the extibition
of sensibility by certain parly ediors
when the unfairness of themselves or
iny of their party is exposed in the columns
>f papers which are accustomed to present
he truth impartially on both sides. Acording
to the ethics of these sapient en ghtners
of the dear people, a journal bat
to right to discuss political questions, or
xpose political trickery at all, unless it eners
the lists as a purty champion. With
hem party?the parly, and ITS offices are
very thing, the country and ife interests
lothing. They can bear lo b&l'exposcd in
tarty prints, because tho public have
earned to make allowance for much of
vhat is foun i in such prints: but when it is
lone where the public, for good reason, are
iccustomod to look for the truth and not ling
but the truth, then their ire is up. '

The meeting was then addressed in a mar
ner highly, interesting by Mr. Emerson,

ance pledge wag subscribed by about thirt
persons, by whom the following resolution
were unanimously adopted.
"Whereas there is a Temperance pipf
ably edited in this State, therefore,
Resolved, That we as a society do high!
approve of, apd recommmend it to the friend
of Temperance throughout the State.

upon Retailing as a nuisance in any neighbo
hood, and do greatly lament, that any set <
men are permitted by our State to bring sue
temptyfons before ouraervants, our friend
and Especially our children.
jtesaktd, That we as aAoeiety.do look wit
stem disapprobation upon the North Carolir
ichiskey wagons which come into our midi

night.
Resolved, That in our estimation* Drunkei
ness and Retailing violate many of the mo
sacred rights and privileges of the sober pa
of the community.
Resolved, That we aa a Society do high!
disapprove of the course of many of 01
candidates who condescend to treat for the
election te offices of honor and usefulness i
our State.
Rc sol ted, likewise. That a copy of the pr<
ceeding* of this meeting be forwarded ft
publication to the Farmer's Gazette and tb
