From the Charleston Courier.
We lately published an admirable let
ter from Governor Hammond- to some
busy philantropists of Glasgow. who
having, we presume, fed and clothed all
their own starving weavers at home, were
kindly interesting themselves on behalf of
our conVicted crIminals;- We do not.ob

alone prevents, our translating it entire
from the pages of the Courier des Elats
Unis, wherein we findit. The same calm
and temperate tone distinguishes it which
we noticed in the production our late Gov
ernor, After enlarging upon the impolicy
and the impracticability of abolishing sla
very in Algeria, the Marshal proceeds
thus:
"Call to mind, my Lord Duke, that the
Koran permits the, possession of slaves,
whilst at the same tite it ordains that they
should be treared as children of the tent.
The Arabs rarely contravene this order.
The negro and the negress fortn. to a cer
tain extent, a portion of the family, and
nothing is more .rare to see no Arab.ill
treat hs slaves. This fact is an answer to
the question of humanity."
"1 am convinced that it is better for
the Arabs of Soudan, who from any.
chancefall into slavery, to b sold to the
Arabs of Tell and of-the LittleDesert,
than. to remain in the handsof the enemy
whdohas seized them. I ought to add that
the Arabs often give liberty to their slaves.
Such is the case after *a certain numbier of
years of faithful service; or at the death
of the chief or of. any important member
of the tent."
- "You will perceivelmny lord Duke, that
when things ate seen'from such a dtstance,
and-in a single point of view, and under
the influemnce of a isentiment in itself wor
thy of approbation. one is apt. to deceive

WASHINOTON, Dec. 16, 1844.
REPORT OF SECRETA.aY OF .TsEAsURY.
The report of -the Secretary was pre.
sented to the t'wo, Houses of .Congress. rt
is very longandin anticipation of its pub
lication a .length, Isend you an abstract of
some. of its most important provisions:
Meeips.-For the fiscal year ending
Jtune 30, 1844,. fron all sour
ces, . $30,381,755
Balance in Treasury Ist
January, 1843, - 10.424.25/
- . 40,816.257
Balance in the Treasury $7,857.379
Estimated receipts for- the
year 1844, (from July 1844 to
July 1845,) the sum of $34 204,874
Of this amount the sum of 32,139.000
is expected from the sales of the Public
Lands.
The report contains the following state
ments -and suggestions :
That the Public Debt is-$24.745,188.
That the expenditures of the fiscal.year
upon which we have entered, closing 30th
of June. 1845, will be $32,955,827.
.That the population of the country in50
years, will bg70.000,000..
Tfiatihe present land laws should be
rn'afei-ally chbanged and improved, and un
der this head the various policies of grad
uation and distribution are discussed.
That these should be a r,-vision of th3
Tariff but not at the present session of
Congress. That the present time should
be improved in obtaining information for
future action. That Coagress should be
especially careful to avoid a deficient rev
enue.
That niensures should be taken for re
deeming the Government Stock.
That in time of peace it is a wise and
eccessary policy to prepare for war, and
to lay up all those military stores which
will make us independent of foreign Go
vernments. That the only wise policy for
all Governments is to be prepared for all
emergencies as they may arise.
This report will be printed in full to
morrow, but I ,end you an early abstract
-givin some of the important recom
mendations.
