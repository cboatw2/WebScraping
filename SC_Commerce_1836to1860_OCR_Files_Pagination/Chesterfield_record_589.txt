From these statistics, it seems plain
'hat the changes effected in the political !
character of so many state legislatures
\ by the recent elections are to he ascribed
chiefhj to Whig voters, or at least persons ;
who voted the Harrison ticket last fa!!,
allying away from the elections, while
the great bodv of the Democratic voters

(|f ?an be made to turn out much belter, at a ]
future election without another hard cider
excitement is a question for the consideration
of politicians. Democrats think
th#y cannot, Whigs think they can.? '

We have observed the above, circulating

by holding his seal in the Senate, give to
the country the benefit nfhis weighty example
in .(liscontenancing a theoretical

Were there tio important principle at
stake to prevent the resignation of Co!.
Preston at this tiine we have no doubt
that it wnufJjK' much more agrceabelo
his feelings to retire from t!ie S mate Han
c?
to remain in it under existing circumstances.
Ret there litis been for vears a
gradual and alurmiriT declension in our
s. n
political insifitulions. There has heen a
growing tendencv to pass through ullrti
< ? 7
democracy to anarchy. >Ve shaii at pr< sent,
however, advert to this tendency
only at the point where it hears upon
the subject before us. From the time
w en the prose,*constitution went into
operation, selfish demagogues, as well as a
few true, but shortsighted and misguided
patriots, have been striving to break
down that feature in the government
which was designed to give it stability
and fixed character bv rendering it, in
w P 7
seme measure,independent of tire frequent
and evanescent changes to which popular
opinion is necessarily liable under the
itifiucncc ?f free institutions. And they
have, to no inconsiderable extent, sue
ceeded in accomplishing their purpose, in
several of the states. The {'rumors of the
constitution having learnt from ex periencc,
under the Articles of Confederation,
the great evils of rendering (be tenure of
.ofiare by the representatives of the states
in Congress, dependent upon the mere
will of the state legislatures, provided, in
the hew constitution that the re prostatativrs^q
the states shouKl hold their places
for the term of six years, and, that, independently
of any change of opinion1 in
}ho states or their legislatures in the mean
time. But it has now in some slates,
heroine the practice, in palpable violation
of (his important provision of. the constitution,
to instruct senators out of their
seats, or in other words, to recall them,
just as often as the fluctuations <if eiihei
local or general noli tics, or the short-lived
intrigues of unprincipled demagogues can
1)2 made to effort changes in th,e party
character of the stale legislatures. And ;nstances
have occunedof instruct tons being
. t
given by the legislature of the same slate
of a character cian.elrirnllv Opposed tc
.? it ... .
each other, at intervals nt no! more than a
ft/ L ? % 7
single venr and of Senators lining recalled,
with commissions' fo. six rears, who had
served only a single session! The gonera!
adoption of such practice would be nr
effectual change of the constitution on
tills point, anc! would he carrying the
country hack, not openly and fairly,- but
hv stealth, to n provision in the Articles c?l
Confederation wbic.h past experience had
;;;oved tr work so \crv I adiv that v.r
judicious slalctiuan thought >f retaining
it. *
U'iiv do not those who wish to limit
the term of senatorial s<:r*.ice, by toe mere
changeable will of the shite legislatures,
come to the p ant openly and boldly, like
fair and honest men. I>v proposing an
amendment of the constitution to that effect
? Evidently because they know t!.c
deliberate opinion of the public would be
against them, and that they could not
procure the adoption of such an amendment.
No State in the Union would vote
fur it. What they cannot do directly,
thev therefore, attempt to do indirectly,
hv occasional insidious and passionate appeals
to party prejudice ; and hy sophistical
misrepresentations of the doctrine that
n representative is responsible to his const:!
nuts. ii is true that the representative
is responsible to his constituents; hut
th<s responsibility iSth fined and controlled
by ilie constitution and laws of the land,
which govern the constituent as well as
iiie representative.
Yhe present is the first time, so far as
we recollect, that an attempt has been
made in South Carolina to subvert this
important feature ir: our constitution ; and
the honorable lot of resisting the attempt
has fallen upon Col. Preston. Although
for the manly and faithful discharge of
his uiitv much \ indent a buy has been

j from him, or he from the slate, on sorr.c 1 f
prominent and exciting questions of *oa-iyt
tional politics, she stiil knows and appro- J?
; eiates his sptehdid talents, his noble char- j *
' actcr and his ardent devotion to her ife-d I

Her course towards Ol. Preston is an il- ! t
' hydration of this, and we cannot doubt.:1
' that her further course towards him will '
I continue to be an illustration of it. All j j

that a marriage could not exist

The Court was of opinion, that the (
marriage proton ill this case, although (
not valid for the purpose of excluding the t
Icslimouyvif tlie w ife, was valid for the \
purpose of mitigating the killing toman- j
slaughter, '('he Court said, that offences <
by slaves, w-r.less provided lbr by statuus, |
were governed by the principles of tin* J
common law. 11* a slave strikes another, | '
iirui the blow i<s returned,, even with a
deadly weapon,so violently, as to take life
the killing is mitigated to manslaughter, j!
Iiy the humane pririciplesof the common J
law; accor.lirg to which, from a proper
regard to the fraihtv of human nature, ,
. J I
the killing is presu med to he tlie effect of: (
addon passion, and not of malice afore- [,
thought or wickedness of heart. The, |
same principle was applicable to {he pre-^;
sent case. > o one would for an instant j <
siipjrose that the passion caused by urtex- f <

than the infliction of a v. wv. The result , '
[hen should he tuG same. If, as is settled j
a bloic from a slave will produce the "fu- .
rorbrevis" much more will an injury of j
this kind provj in this case.
But it may he said, this indulgence i
imong white men, is only extended tr? i

)f 7 and 8 o'clock, the house of Mr. '
Licorge Ovcrstreet, distant 10 miles from

Suwannee river, in Hamilton county, j
was fired on by a party of Indians, sup- f
josed to number about fifteen. Two of I
Mr. O. Overstreel's children were killed,
ind his wife and two children wounded.

were in the hopse at tlie time, hut es- :
[raped unhurt. Or. Ilaglin, who whs also !
iu the house at the same time, is mortally
wounded, having received three halls
in his body. He immediately find from
die house, hut from the loss of blood, was
j.nahle to proceed more than three hundred
yards, where lie secreted himself un:ii
morning. Mr. Ovfcrstreet, his lady,
ind two wounded children fled, and made
jood their escape. Mrs, O. and her two
children \\ ho are wounded, were .shot
with arrows* This is most conclusive
;woofth?t the ammunition of the Indians
must he r.earlv exhausted. The Indians
dundcred trie Imu.se and then applied the j
orch, burning it to the ground, with the
ifeless bodies of Mr. O.'s two childreu in
