To the Ministers of the diteru t.Religious
Denoninitious in. the St, e of- South
Carolina. -
brethren and Friends:
We are fully aware of the difficulty of
approaching you upon the subject- of this
cotmunication. wit bout incurring the odi
um of a wish to obtrude upon that sacred
spheres of duties, which under the solemn
sanctious of ministerial fidelity to the Al
mighty, occupies your thoughts and de
mands all your energies. And as temper
ance-is one of the Christian graces, which
as the legitimate part of true religion, it is
your province, and doubtless has been your
effort to promote it, may be deemed ioper
tineut in an association which is not pro
fessedly engaged in the high and holy
employment of teaching religion, to omer
any suggestions on the subject., permit us
then to disavow altogether any inclination
or design to interfere with your peculiar
functions, or to prescribe to you the way
of rendering them successful However
we may diff'er from you on many points,
whether of religious faith or practice, for
we profess as a body no common creed as
to either, we-have too high an estimate of
your intelligence and integrity as the ac
credited'instructo:s and pastors of your
respective charges, to suppose that you
would acquiesce in an improper intrusion
upon yourrights, or listen !o the gratuitous
counsel of self-authorized monitors. Yet
we should do you equal injustice if we
deemed you insensible to the voice of
friendly and afectiounate experience, only
seeking to invite your attention to princi
ples and facts; conceived to be of grave im
portance to all who inherit man's proneness
to evil, and are the subjects of God's su
preme moral government. That great,
and extensive and happy changes have
been wrought in the moral ani physical
condition of society by the temperance
reformation, is too generally conceded a
fact to need substantiation. Even those
who question the soundness of the princi
ples upon which it has proceeded, and
hence anticipate no lasting results, do not
deny that drunkenness, with its attendant
evils, has been materially diminished both
as to extent and degree, and the manifest
improvement in the state of sea-fa:ing
men, who were once so proverbially ad
dicted to this Vice, would flatly gainsay
every voice which should attempt to in
validate the position that sobriety and tem
perance have resulted from tbes- efforts.
That 1800 seamen have within the last
two years in the City of Charleston alone
pledged themselves, and so far as man
knows kept the pledge to abstain from all
intoxicating liquors as a bevarage, is a fact
which should be looked at steadily by the
friends of humanity, who remember the
past. That the Clergy hage riot contrib
nted to these results the records of our
body would disprove-that they have
done as much as they might, the most ar
dent and successful would scarcely affirm
-that those who have withheld their aid
altogether or yielded it sparingly and reluc
tantly have been influenced by other than
motives satisfactory to their own minds,
we presume not to suspect. We only
point to actual benefits already obtained,
existing evils starring us in the face, pros
pective success awaiting our judicious ef
forts, and invoke your important aid.
Our principles are as simple as possible,
and their hare announcement, would at
once, we should suppose secure the assent
and confidence of every judging head and
feeling heart. We believe that the prac
tice of using intoxicating liquors as an or
dinary beverage is a bad one. We have
given it up ourselves, and have induced
those under our influence to do the same.
and as a protection against the idle solici
tations of others. and the capricious de
sires of our own appetites. have resorted to
the solemnity of a persottal pledge. The
consideration whica move us is apart from
the desire of moral self-defence, benevo
lence, the desire of throwtng a moral
shield around others. That any should
object to such principles when self-denial
for the sake of doing good to ourselves rad
others, is one or the fundamental laws of
revealed trnth; and wvhedi solemn cove
nants are universally prescribed in the
word of God, and in the business of society,
appears to us strange. If it be our Chris
tianliberty to drink wine, surely it is equals
ly to give it up-and by giving it up for
tbe purpose of feeding the poor, a part of
our worldly substance, which it is our
Christian liberty to retain, we do no
wrong; but on the contrary where our tmo
. tives and ends are right, secure the appro
bation of God and our consciences, and of
all good, men. Why, we would ask,
should not those, who to save their fellow
men from the fatal snares of an evil cus
teom, exercise their liberty by relinquishing
that custom, be exonerated from all impu
tations of subjecting themselves to a legal
yokes If a bond to cive up for charitable
uses a portion of our proper: y be not wrong,
ought the pledge to give u p the use of wine
for the blessed-charity of rescintg the
druakard and keeping 'he sober from he

praise the Christian, who to devote the
cost of his wine to pions uses, should re
linquish its consumption. And can it be
that we reprehend hi-n when he pursues
the same course. with the view not of do
ing good with its piurchase money, hut of
preventing evil by its abandonment? The
same God who has enjoined us to practice
charity, has informed us that it is true
charity to give up our wine, if our brother
is *hereby to stumble, or is offended, or is
made weak. But it is not our purpose to
argue this subject, nor must we be sus
peeted of any intention to imply that the
intesof religion in our State. need to
:be themselves exhorted to banish the or
.dinary use of intoxicating liquors, as a
neans of their own safety-though sad
enonnments of past weakness may be
found in every religious body-and -Let
itim that thinketh he standeth take heed
Jest he fall," is a maxim of common sense,
-as well es the caution of Divine Wisdom.
It is chiefly as it relates to others, Church
nembers, Sunday School Teachers, the
young servants, the poor, all who come
within the special influence of the Clergy
it is chiefly on account of these that we
solicit your immense moral weight in con
sigaing to the same oblivion which cov

May we not hope, then, in our attempt
to banish, so far as is practicable, that wine

the spiritual guides and guardians of the
people. -

We observe that Mr. Calhoun is spo
ken of in most of the.papers which have
published the address, as having with
drawn himself as a candidate for the Pres
idency. We think this is incorrect, at any
rate not warranted by the address. Mr.
Calhoun did not place himself in that po
sition. He was nominated by his friends
for an office, which according-to his de
clared opinion, was neither to be solicited
nor declined. He refuses, in his address.
to abide the decision of a packed Conven
tion. But he cannot withdraw from a po
sition he never assumed. It is for those
who placed him there to withdraw him or
not-to give him their support, or transfer
it to andther. We believe this will be de
termined by circumstances hereafter to be
come known. If we can advance the
cause for which we have been contending
or the principles of which we have regar
ded Mr. Calhoun as the ablest supporter,
and for his support of which we were his
advocates, by transferring our votes to
another, it will be sound policy, and no
abandonment.of principle to do so. But
"under no circumstances whatever," can
we support any man who is opposed to
our doctrines, and w hose friends in Con
gress prove by their votes that they are so
opposed. Better will it be-far better for
South Carolina to rally around her favor
ite son, even if she rallies alone-to take
no part in the scramble for oflice, where
parties are not divided by principles, but
by thirst for power-and if the system of
monopoly and plunder is to be fastened on
us, it cannot then be said that wo-aided

We trus: our deep respect for, and entire
confidence in the good faith, ability and
patriotism of Col. Burt are too well known

I percive you approve of Mr Rhett's
course in declining to serve on the Special
Committee raised on the Massachusetts

very materially altered the state of things.

IR. CA LHOUN & MR WEBSTER
IN ENGLAND.
An English paper speaks of the views of
Mir. Calhoun and Mr. Webster, otn the
ommercial policy of the Untited States, it
says:-" Undor any circumstances the
views of Mr. Calhoun wvould be deserving
f consideration. He is one of thbe most
emarkable men in the United States; an
mpressive speaker, and an acute and ori
cinal thinker, who has devoted much of
his time and talents,through a long public
career, to qnestions of commerce, 6nance,
and currency. He has been in practical
tatesmanship, what Col. Thompson (a
great free trade writer in England) has
beetn through the press.
-"There are two great parties ins that
ountry, (iAmerica,) the Whigs and Dem
crats, the former answering to our Tories,
and the latter to the Ltberals of'this conn
try. Mr. Webster is one of the distin
uished men of the Whig party, which
aas always professed to advocate the prin
ciples of proteetioh. In this respect, the
Whir. in Atnorica and the Tories in En
glind, occupy analogous posiions.-;The
tendency of pub1ie opinion having.-ho-I
ever, been there, as hero,-strongly in favor
of free trade, the leaders of the Whigs. like "
those of our tories, have been - compelled
to trim. Hence arose the demonstration
by Mr. Webster, at Baltimore, a -few
months ago, when he made a speech much
commented on by the newspapers, in fa
vor of commercial treaties-* mere elec
tioneering movement, intended to catch
the vote of the free trade party, without
alarming the Whigs. In this plan of pro
ceedings, the aristocratic party of Ameri
ca, and that of our country. occupy pre
cisely the same ground. Sir Robert Peel
and Mr. Gladstone are the leaders of a
party which has been always. professing
anti-free trade views. Seeing, however,
the impossibility ofrestricting the tenden
cy of public opinion towards freedom of
commerce, our Tory politicians are taking 1
a leaf from Mr. Webster's book, by advo
cating commercial treaties. We believe
the sincerity of the political leaders on
both sides of the Atlantic, is about the
same. They are certainly not in a posi
tion to claim the charactor of consistency I
from their own party whilst the genuine
free traders regard their scheme of com- A
mercial treaties as a mere device for post
poning the honest adoption of their princi
pIes."
Accident on.the Rail Road.-On:Satnr
day evening last. about 9 o'clock, 'the care
on the Rail Road near Hamburg, ran over
ainegro man4and literally cut him to pie
ces. This negro had but a short time pre
vions stopped at the depot, and was cau
tioned not to proceed on the road, as the
cars would'shortly leave. He however
went on a short distance, laid himself down
across the railing and went to sleep. He
was intoxicated at the time, and thus
staggered into eternity, unconscious of his
fate.

Mississipp.-By the late accounts from
Jackson, the small pox was prevailing to
an extent that threatened to break up the
session of the Legislature prematurely. A
member of the Senate Mr. Boyd, died of
the disease on the 30th ult. and several
other members were sick.
The Vicksburg Sentinel attacks Gov.
Brown as a traitor to the pure unadultered
repudiation fait h, because he recommended
the payment of the Planters' Bank Bonds
a debt created before the present State
Constitution and excepted by name in that
instrument, from the operation of the clause
limiting the Legislative power to pledge
the credit of the State. The Vicksburg
'Sentinel wishes repudiation to stand on the
"high" ground that State debts ought not
to be paid at all. It goes for "principles."

[BY REQUt:T.]
As the time for the election of Governor
of ibis State is approaching, it is proper to
look around for some person capuable of
filling that high station with usefulness and
honor. In many parts of the State the
name of the Hon. Wiliam Aiken, Senator
from St. Philip's and St. Michael's has
been put before the people in connection
with the office, and none has yet been I
uggested whi:h affords such general satis- i
faction, wherever it has been offered.
Mr. Aiken has served in the Legislature
for several years, and with increased repu
tatiotn at each session: he was at first in'
the House of Representatives, and at the
last general election ho was returned by
his constituents, unanimously, as one of.
their Sena'ors. Dutring the whole course of
his public life, he has beeni most favorably
known'ito all w'o htave served with him,
in either branch of t he Genetral Assembly.
for his constant urbanity of inanners, strik'
ing capacity for btusiniess, and lofty ide
pendence of character. In private life lie
has successfully devoted himself to the
cultivation of the soil, and is inseparably
connected with the paramount interest of
the State, Agriculture. From the pturely
Democratic priaciples which he has always
professed and acted upon, lhe will be emri
nently qualified to inforce that system of
rigid accountability and strict economy so I
essential to the dlue administration of the
finances of this State, atnd which the peo- .
pie will here.after always require of the in
cumbet~nts of office.
Under these circumstances, without dis
paraging the merits of other gentlemen
who have been named, anid without re- -
course to caucus or combination, the
friends of Mr. Aiken present his name on
the people for their consideration, well as
sured that no one can be round morecquali
ified to serve them, or whose election will(
give more general satisfaction to all parts
of the State. GR E ENVIL LE.
Accidenls.-Between 7 and 8 o'clock
on Sunday night last, the Stage, which t
runs from this place to Laurens C. ii. wvas.
turned over, about 1j miles from our Vil-n
lage, it being very dark at the titme. The
front wheels became detached from the 1
balance of the vehicle, and the horses
came into town without the driver. They
passed down Main street, not much faster
than usual, until they came opposite the
Post Office, when they turned and came to
the door. There they almost stopped. hut
immediately started at a pretty fast gait,
and went to the Stage Office, nearly op
posite. There again they seemed disposed9
to stop. and slacketned their pace. A t that
place Mr. Philip N. Powers, a Merchatt
of our Village, was standing upon the -
side walk, atnd attempted to take hold ofa
one of the biridles-thte horses at that in-a
stant started off' at an increased speed-d
Mr. Powers stepped back to give room for
the wheels to pass, and in doing so, broke
both bones of htis right leg, threo or four in
ches above the ancle. W~hether the wheel
or any thing else streck him-, is not known;
hut we are iniclined to think, from what
we can learn, that the accident was occa- -
sioned by a su.Jden and violent turn of theJ
foot upon the pavement. Medical aid was t
soon brought to his assistance, the fractur
ed limb set, and we learn that~he is doing
well. We understand that there was no~
other injury Austained, worthy of notice.

Porget alone my faults;
