After the reading of the letter General

t-'tred to the mfli'nrv regulations upon the
subject, and in the course of his r -marks
he quoted the 5th or icleof wai to prove thai

of hos.ility, he would have subjected hmiscl
to the punishment of death !
fly (jr-n. G nines?What were the motive*
whrch induced Gen. Gaines to g*>?o Flor

Answer?In consequence of the alarm
rnp intelligence from Florida and the new
of Dade's massacre, (den. Gain's at Mobili
on the 17th January, suit for n*.e, and sail
that he had left his Head Quarters at Mem
phis, but with no expectation -o be lvquroi
to take the field against an enemy?that h
was withou* his staff and referring to the in
telligcnce above stated, he d d me the hono
to reqnes* mo to join his mili ary family fo
purposes connected with the protection c
the people of Florida. The day follovviiii
(the 18th Januarx) farther intelligence ni
lived from Florida, to the effect that Ger
Clinch had had a meeting with the encm
?had fought a battle with them, had bee
aba?doned by the volunteers in coic^qucuc
of their fc.m'of service having expired, an
had been obliged to fall back oh Fori Kinc
where, as report said, he was invested, b
the enemy and in danger of being cut of
It was in consequence of this now inforina
tion, as I believe, that the order of that dat
(18ih) addressed ro Col. Twiggs at Nim
Orleans, was issued. Gen. Gaines proceed
ed to Pensacola, with a view to solicit th
co-operation of the naval forces oil that sta
tion in the purpose he then contemplated i
going to Florida; his wishes had been an
ticipated, and he returned to ' New Orlcan
about the 26th of Jan., when the most ac
tive exertions were made to receive int
service and equip for a campaign the volun
teers alluded to in the above mentioned 01
der.
The troops being in readiness *o embark
left New Orleans on the 4th of February
During this period, an i for some lime af.ci
the prevailing sentiment of Gen. Gaines, ai
discovered by the whole tenor of his remark
and conduct, was a profound sensibility t<
the loss of our brave brothers in arms ii
Florida, and to the exposed condition o
the people in that country. Previous t<
leaviug New Orleans, among oilier report
circulated, it was stated that Talfuhasso
had been taken, burnt and destroyed by tn<
enemy. This and other rumors produce*
so general an excitement throughout thn
section of Louisiana, that they induced ex
traordinarv exertion on the part of the Ex
ccu'ive and Legislative authority of th
State, and I suppose it would have been im
possible for any otlicer, situated as Genera
Gaines was at that time, and having th
proper feelings and sense of his duty, l
have hesitated a moment, but that he was

and accordingly the Court was adjourne<
until to-morrow (Saturday) at 11 o'clocl
A. M.
Frederick, Md. .Tan. 14.1837.
On the re-assembling of the Court thi
morning, Major Gen. Gaines observed tha
he had a few more questions to propose t<
the witness, (Captain Hitchcock) in refer
eoce to his, (Gen. G's.) course of conduc
while in^Florida, and with permission of tli(
Court he would proceed. Assailed as !i<
bad hoen in such a diversity of ways, i
would be difficult to trace ail the various
charges through die labyrinth of testimony
before the Court, and he would rather risl
his reputation and honor upon the evident
of a few witnesses who were near at hand
than wade through the mazy passages n
search of minor accusations. The Cour
will, of course, in the rebuttal of the grave
charges, discover the improbability of trutl
in those of a less heinous character. "Tin
Court are well aware thai 1 did not seel
this investigation?it was forced upon mo
and now that I am before them, I am do
teimiucd to make such an exposition of tlx
grievances under which my character has
been groaning for a year past, as will Ibrev
er set at rest the vituperative and slandering
e rut i
tongues 01 my enemies. 1 ne oniy trcasurt
I have to leave my children, is a rcputalior
earned by many years of hard e.\{)cricnc(
in the service of my country, and as I siial
remain ltd a short lime longer in the Army
1 wish that name to be transmitted to therr
untarnished.
By Gen. Gaines?"What reason was
there for. expecting Gen. Scott at Catnt
Izard ?"
Answer?The^expectation was founded
upon information derived from Gen. Clinch
at Fort King.
By Gen. Gaines?Did Gen. Gaines exprcs9
any other reasons for his expecting
General Scott to arrive^at Camp Izard with
force and supplies ?
Answer?The confidence of General
Gaines that General Scott would come tc
Camp Izard oiuthcOuithlacochccwns without
reservation. He appeared to have on
unuoub.ing belief of Gen. Sco; 's being at
Fort Draue, and often spoke of his duty tc
come down under the circumstances in the
most positive terms, llis language on the
subject was vry strong, to wit, "that he
must come down." "He will be disgraced
if he does not come clown." "He will o horwise
commit suicide upon his milttarv
reputation;" or language of a very similar
import.
"On one occasion I took the liberty ol
suggesting to Gen. Gaines the expediency
of preparing litters to move tins v.ounded in
the event ot Gen. Scoil's not joining us,and
he declined authorizing me to give tire order,
explaining himselfby the use cf language
like that I have s'a'ed in ivferunce to Gen.
Scott's coming to Camp Izard. In all the

31 I?y the Court?Do you know any thing - (
- i of di) reasons wliioli induced Gen. Gaines ;
to go to Florida, after receiving the letter i
c? o j
- of the Adjutant General at Pensacola, on;]
s j the D.li ot that month ? i
e Answer?One of the firs? remarks in the j I
j j interview I had with Gen. Gaines after re- j I
- eeiving that letter, he said lie believed it to i
il J be his solemn du'y to go. I think he spoke ! <
e i of some pledge made, I believe to tin? vol an- I
- ; teens; but he alluded more particularly to,;
r i bis letter ;o Gen. Ciinc.h, promising liiin his , <
IU.U.W1 uuo.,m,vo yw i..w. , ,
- I ihouglit them sincere, and all who were j I
e present entirely concurred with me, and I |'
am tlie more inclined to continue in that j]
d belief from several considerations. (
c | Although wars among Indian tribes arc I
0 ; sometimes of very long duration, it is sel- 1
| dom that warlike movements among them 1
- ! continue for any length of time. With tribes J!
j at war there may bo years of cessation of 1
-: hostilities, when a war party, as it is called, i
1 is got up with considerable formality, with a 5
feast and a war dunce. The party will then j1
'?| make what they call a strike at the enemy i1
J 1 ?return from the expedition, and, if sue- j
i , ccssful, celebrate their success with a scalp ! I
dance. But this kind of war cannot be j!
j carried on against the whites as, in a war ! (
s i with them the Indians are compelled to em- [
t hr?dv. themsefves. which makes it difficult 1
* | J* 7 _ " .. ;
3 i for them to obtain supplies of ammunition, j
i provision and clothing. In Florida the !t
11 enemy had been so embodied for a length j(
2 j of time. They had some special causes for (
21 a war which had at this time, in part, been ,
t; removed, especially by the conduct of Ose- j
s ola (or Powell) near to Fort King, and the \c
;! language used by him in council?"I am j*
t! satisfied"?referred to the removal of one ; *
? j of those causes. 1
,' I liave heard of other similar instances, i
l; The Indians had been successful indes'royi
ing Major I)adc and his command, and .they ;
r had killed many more than they had lost, j1
1 Gen. Gaines haying taken a position in their 1
? neighborhood which they had found it im- f
; possible to move, they must have seen that ,
, they could not in future have procured from j
. above a supply of provisions consisting ofjc
2 euttio, which the}* had before drawn from J'
s thcr.ce. The opinion among tliein that ' f
.' this poshion was likely to be permanent was i
l calculated to break do.wn their spirit. I ' a
? have always believed also, that the Indians a
i , were informed of the movement of General c
;; Clinch from Fort Drnne on the 5th ofjj.
I March, and they therefore saw additional ^
, | reasons to suppose that they coulJ not main, j
? tain themselves in the country, under the !
i circumstances, and in taking Council on the r
?| evening, of the 5th they concluded to make a
? overtures of peace. I have never doubted I
j that they would have accepted terms such e
II as would have been worthy of this great na- ' li
i! tion to dictate to tnem,nad mere neen au- o
j thority there to conclude a peace. There j c
i was not in t!ie council I held with the In- \ ^
; j dians any thing said about the terms of j ^
i j peace?they made no proposition to me j v
I whatever?'hey asked for no'hing?stipu- j j
11 lated for nothing, beyond what I have s'n
rn ? ^
>; ted in my testimony. They were told by ,'
. me that they should,be sent for to council.! f
i but in the mean time - hoy must abstain from !0
t war, and promise to attend a council when- ! s
?, ever sent for.? they engaged to do all that j
: j freely, and with apparent alacrity. j
;l During tire time the troops remained at :
' i Fort Dranc, say from tlie 11th to the 2G:h j '
'' of March, as I have understood there was . 1
| no sign of hostility on the part of the In-, I.
j dians. They had abundant opportunities a
j to annoy the troops at the post winch were : j
scattered over an extent of country of sew- i
H oral inil<>s in diamter, to accommodate them ^
selves wit!i wood and water. Before I left
i j them, and as I heard afterwards, the officers
I j and men were passing at pleasure between
. j thcscvaral corps ol die army thus dispersed. *
:, and provisions were also sent without once , n
' being disturbed. General Gaines and his t
1 staffi a party of four, during that period p

hrough a country which had boon before
n J was afterwards in possession of the Lilians,
without being molested and without
uspicion of danger. I h.ave always regard<1
this as an evidence that although the Inlinns
were informed on the exposed eondiionofthc
several corps around Fort Uranc,
*ct, so long as thev could hope to be sent
or to meet in council, they abstained from
mnoying those troops, in compliance with
heii* engagement upon thcjOuithlacoochee.
ndued I know ol nothing which lias occur ed
to shake my confidence in the sincerity
)f the Indians at that interview.
Gen. Gaines again addressed the Court:
Mr. President and gentlemen of the Court,
defore offering another question to the witic^s,
I will' take occasion to state, that I have
icon severely censured for not firing upon
iie Indians when they appeared on the mornng
of the Gtli of March. The President
if this Court and myself entered the annv
ogcther on the 10th Junuar}', 1799, and I
lm sure he w ill do tnc the justice to ackuow 1)dge
that I have never yet been guilty of
>o deep and base a crime, as that which
>ome of my enemies would have me to commit.
Sooner than have fired upon those
Indians ichile holding a ichitc flag end leglinn
lor peace, my right arm should be
r: aid and co-operation. 1 think all these j;
>f! poin's were matters of conversation at the !
:i j very first, and were never deviated from. 1 j i
. took the liberty of urging the General not j
). to abandon the expedition at Pensacola, as ^
v : I believed that his presence was necessary j!
n ' to the efficient organization of the troops.,
c I It was my belief that his abandoning the J ]
d J troops would be nearly equivalent to pen- ' I
1 deriug tlie expedition fruitless. I placed i
v j great stress upon the effect of the reputation . I
f. | acquired by Gen. Gaines during the war i
- i with Great Britain, and upon his knowledge <
e j and experience as a soldier. I do not wish <
v r to imply or convey an idea to the Court, j i
I-1 that the officers who were immediately sub- I
e i ordinate to Gen. Gaines were net officers J1
i-1 of great merit, hut neither one of them pos-;;
n sessed all the requisites, united in Genera!
- I Gaines, for securing success to the cam- i
J 1
s ! paign. 'I he Court will understand me as ? <
! referring to the moral influence of his rep- !
o i u'ation and character as a commander. : i
By the Court?What was the amount or; I
force brought by Gen. Clinch to the aid of i
Gen. Games at Camp Izard ? I
, j Answer?IIe brought about five hundred
. ! ?artillery, infantry and volun eers, inclu ,
j ding one troop of mounted men. i
s J By the Court?Do you believe that tlie (<
s i Indians were sincere in proposing a truce ?
o ; Answer?I believe they were perfectly !1
n sincere. I will remark in reference to that j J
'f question, that thei?e was nothing in the man^
i tier or matter of the interview which I had I
s wi h[the Indians on the Ouithlacoochce, to '
e give me the smallest suspicion of theii sin-M
e ceri'y. There seemed to be a peculiar j(
J sadness over them as if thoughtful of the ;(
t misfortnnes of their tribe, indicating tliar !1

severed; I would not lire upon a body of
English, French or Russians who should
present a white fhg and sue for peace; v. by
hen have fired upon a miserable and wretch?d
posse of subdued Indians who came to
jog fbrrjuarter? I should have disgraced
riysclf in my own eyes ! what would the
;ivilized uations ofEurope say to such a
leed, and committed too, by Americans ??
le wouhl not be an American, loving the
lonor of his eounuy, to propose, much
ess to commit, so foul au act ! J will now
isk witness,
What reasons had Gen. G air.es for suspending
his operations against the Indians
pn and after the 6th of March, 133G ?
Answer?The fact that the enemy bad
\iised a white flag and asked for peace?
tad been told the conditions and had prorased
to a bide, by them, by which they were
o have had a council with a view to settle
the terms of that peace.
By the Court?Were the Indians in coun:i!
informed that a large body of troops were
;ommg against rncm :
Answer?I stated in the body of my tesimony
that I told the Indians that General
jr. was but one of several chiefs sent by the
President of the United States to enforce a
>eace upon them. I was not myself informal,
and of course could not communicate
o the Indians, the time at which these forces
would arrive?that information was
conveyed by the reports of the signal guns
vhich were directed to be fired by the save,
al divisions of Gen. Scott's army while apjroaching
the Wiihlacoochee. The Indians
)ccupied a central position, and were much
nore likely to bear these guns than the army
iivisions themselves! The Indians are
>erhaps the best scouts or spies in the world,
md it would have been next to impossible
or a large force to have approached their
;trong hold in that stage of the war without
heir knowledge.
By Gen. Guincs?"Was If, or was not
iferihe Indians had sued for peace that they
vera informed that the large body of iroops
verc coming against them ?''
o o
Answer?It was afcr they had sued for
icace.

Lyrshire heifers.
We are glad to see the Ayrshire breed introuced

I tricts of Chesterfield, Marlborough, Marion j
j and Morry, to hold a convention, to consider ,
I the practicability and expediency of con- j
| slructing a Rail Road from the town of;
j Cheraw. to some point on the navigable j
| waters of the VVaccamaw, have met in
: pursuance of their appointment. <
They contemplate with feelings of pride
j and gratification, the spirit of enterprizc i
| n;;d public improvement, which now per-1
j vades the Pee Dee country. They hail it j
' as the dawn of anew era, on both the physical j
and moral condition of this hitherto dormant j
| section of Carolina, and feel deeply the \
I responsibility imposed on them, of cherish, j
j ing and sustaining the spirit of the times, 1
; by the adoption of energetic but judicious (
and prudent measucrs on their part. They J
' entertain no doubt, from their present in
formation, that the enterprize which now j
| engages the attention of their fellow citi- j
j zens, is both practicable and expedient; but j
thev are unwilling that the capital ot tne j
country should be embarked in an under- !
j taking, which, in any possible contingency j
i may provo cither unfeasible, or vain and j
unprofitable. Convinced, themselves, they j
are anxious to obtain all necessary infor- j
nr.tion to convince the the country at large, j
| that the proposed Rail Road will fully justi- j
| fy their expectations, and amply reward the 1
public spirit, which will be engaged in it, \
I therefore,
1. Resolved,Thai three commissioners be
' appointed, whose duty it shall be to employ
; the services of a competent Engineer or
, other scientific person, and, with him, make
a general rnronnoissance of the country i
through which the contemplated Rail Road I
will pass, to enquire into the general advant- j
j ages that may result from it, the quantity !
of freight which the commerce of the {
country will supply, the comparative facil- |
ities of transportation by Kail Koad and j
by water conmunication, and the probable .
cost per mile, of the construction of this Rail
Read, and report on the same to an ad- !
journcd meeting of this convention.
2. Resolved,'Hvit committies of three be ;
appointed in each of the districts represent- j
ed in tiiis coiivention, who shall raise by '
contribution such funds, as mav be neccs- .
i
sary, to defray the expenses incident to the ;
survey of the country ; and that three other j
persons shall be appointed in each district, 1
who shall in person accompany the En-,
ginccr and Commissioners while engaged
in the reconnoissance of their respective
districts.
3. Ilcsolvcd, That the Chairman of the
Commissioners appointed to employ and
accompany the Engineer, be Treasurer.
4. Resolved,Thai the President he authorized
to convene lhc Delegates as soon as he
shall be apprised that the Commissioners
have accomplished the investigation of the
subjects rclerred to them, and are ready to
report thereon.

points of termination. Commissioners
appointed under this Resolution, were Henryl)urant,
Garret Gowan and Thomas A.

Mr. James Wright offered the following j
Resolution. Resolved, That should either ofj

Mr. T. C. Evans, after some appropri-j

Dear Sir?On Monday last, oraof my hunters
arrived here, from Cross Timbers, who
informed rac, as a fact, that he wastoldhythc
Cachies, that a party of the Camanches kitted
and scalped a white man, in the praires near
the Cross Timbers. A hunting party of the
Choctaws received far titer inforinatior?from
the same band of the Cachies, that all the different
tribes of Indians in the West, were uniting
with a view to declare a war against the
; United States. The war against Texas was
already declared. The Cachies stated, also,
, that tlie Mexicans were their close friends and
would act in their behalf; and farther stated'
that then all the chiefs of different nations
' were busy in holding councils, to effect a tnrionr
1 of all the different tribes in the West. The
Cachies gave strong hints to the Choctaws to
join thein.
I give you this brief account, just as it wastold
to ine, thinking it is for our country, ,
and to give you information of the plans adopted
by the wild Indians against our peace.?
1 think the Mexicans are at the head of it.?
The plan of a union of all the different tribes,
is a policy too deep for wild Indians to study
out and adopt."

Texas.?The New Orleans S.andarJ
furnishes a very curious account of the action
of the different branches of the Texan
Government in relation to Santa Anna. The
rumors reaching the ears of the members
of Congress that President Houston intended
to liberate the Mexican chiefs, theypassed
the following resolution :
44 ResoWid, That the President be, and ishereby,
ves ed with the custody and disposal
of all prisoners of war : Providtdy That
the prisoners Santa Anna and Almonte shall
not Iks released or set at liberty on any oc.
cusion, without t'10 concurrence of the
Senate ; and that the President shall not
have the power to release said prisoners,
during the recess of the Senate."
This resolution was immediately vetoed
by Cen. Houston. The Congress, notwithstanding,
passed it again by the coiv
sti u ional majority of two.thirds and it bts
came a law. President Houston determined
to rt lease Santa Anna at all hazards
; pronounced the resolution unconstitutional,
and a usurpation of his executive
authority, and, in the face of the la* of
Congress, set Santa Anna free, and put thp
whole Congress at defiance. The army
being wi'.li the Presjdent in all things, Congress
succumbed.

An editorial article in the Lima, published
in the city of Mexico, represents the country
as being divided into three parties?one being*
i i favor of Santa Anna, asecond for Busta-.

of the Lima has the following upon the subject.

"Mexico, Dec. 15.?Three parties now exist
in the Republic?the violent partizans of
the democracy?ihe sincere friends of liberty
?and the admirers of the ancient regime.?
To these three parties belong indirectly the
Scotch and Yorkanies, and they are now the
only three which are endeavoring to govern
the nation,each according to their own method.

Treasury order issued by Secretary Woock

York. It must commend itself to the approbation
of all at a time when so many vessels
are wrecked near that port.
Treasury Department, Jan. 9,1837.
Sir?In the present inclement season, it is
thought proper to combine with the ordinary
duties of the cutters, tli.it of assisting vessels
found on the coast in distress, and of administering
to the wants of their crews. For this
purpose, 1 have to request that you will direct
the commanding officers of the revenue cutters
Alert and Hush to prepare for an immediate
cruise. To enable them to fulfil the
duties expected of them vou will cause them
to be furnished with such quantities of provisions,
water, wood, and all necessary supplies
as can be conveniently stowed in the
vessels. an P direct th^rti to cruise
