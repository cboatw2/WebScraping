We hereby again beg leave to call the attention
of our citizens to the necessity of adopting such
measures as will guaranty to the Fire Engine
Company of our town the very small sum of three
hundred dollars, which is all that is now necessary
to procure an efficient Engine, and prevent a dissolution
of one of our most useful corporations.
We arc aware that many of our citizens have already
liberally subscribed, which, together with the
donations from two of the Insurance Companies
of Charleston, have made up the amount of $500
making a deficit of only $300, which is expected
will be appropriated out of the town fund, to which
our citizens have now a right to look for such aid.

New Orleans, June 3.
We have received the following letter
from a highly respectable source :
Matatnoras Prison, May 3. 1837.
Dear Sirs?In haste I will address you
a few lines by Capt Minor, to inform you,
how we are situated. We left New Orlean
on the evening of the eighth of April, aud

morning of the twelfth, at the mouth of the!
Sabine, bearing N. N. W, distant six
miles, in the United States waters, by the'
armed Mexican brig General Teran. Afler
we were captured about three hours,
stood to the southward and fell in with
the schooner Flash; they fired, and hove
the Flash too. While the Flash hove too,
the brig General Houston hove in sight.1
O o
They thought proper to let tne schooners
and brig go, and m ike sure of one.
After this we made sail, and stood south
and S. S. E. wind bearing N. N. E., and
blowing heavy. They took out principally
all the passengers and put them on
board the brig; we continued our course
and fell in about twenty miles below the
mouth of the river Rio Grande. There
the schooner was taken in Over the Bar.
After waiting a long time on it, and leaking
badly, she was taken up the river
about lllne miles, and then pillaged of her
cargo, and furniture, and baggage of the
passengers, and a considerable amount of
money.
They confined me and several of my
passengers in irons for several days in a
most brutal manner, and told us we should

We believe the American Consul is doing
all that he can for us. I have not heard
positively whether the vessel and cargo
has been condemned or not; but that
makes no difference, as the greater part of
the cargo has hecn stolen.
There is a great deal more that I would
wish to write you, but for fear of its not
reaching you, I must desist.

received our files to May 13th, which,
however did not reach us till this morning
They do not cohtain any thing of unusual
interest. The Colony seems quiet, but
evidently as fivtful and impatient as ever,
under the variations and demoralizing system
of negro apprenticeship which has
been forced upon the planters to gratify
the visionary speculations of abolition
philanthropists at home. The Kingston
Chronicle mentions as oiic of the consequences,
thai the white indented emigrants
beginning to be imported to replace the
negroes; are when found to be possessed
of valuable qualities, immediately bribed
and enticed away. For example, a gentleman
who had white men sawyers, two
of whom saw 210 feet boards a day, equal
to three pair of blacks allow them every
Saturday to ctitl vaie their o\Vn grounds;
but interested and dishonorable persons
entice them away on that day, by offering
them a penny a foot. This lends to
drunkenness, and also to dissatisfaction
at the more moderate wages for which
they arc apprenticed.
The Arch bishop of Cuba, who has
been on a visit to the Catholic establishments
at Jamaica, has taken his departure
He was much pleased with the Catholic
congregation of Kingston.
The stipendiary or imported magistrates
arc as usual the subject of increasing
complaints for their constant interference
in rather promoting insubordination
than obedience on the part of the negroes.
It appears that not content with fomenting
mischief at home, our abolition fanatics
have sent out emissaries to Jamaica to look
into the working of the apprenticeship law.

the colonies. At Demerara the "Saintecrafti

From the Boston Morning Post.
Consumption.?We have made the following
abstract of on article in the Medical
Library, respecting the causes and prevention
of consumption, which we think
may be both int??reshntr Ami iwornt
many of our readers.* |
1st. There can be no doubt in lite world
that pulmonary consumption is an hereditary
disease; or rather that the tendency '
or liability to it prevails very remarkably
in particular families. Those who have
fair skin and fair and soil hair, are upon
the whole, most predisposed to tuburcuiar
consumption. It appears to be moit pre-.
vulent among chichen breasted individuals,
who have long necks, soft hair, and
long eyelashes. j
3d. Consumption prevails most at particular
ages?between the ages of fifteen
and twenty-five. It often occurs, both at
an earlier period, when children breathe \
an impure air, and at a later period from
a variety of indirect causes.
3d. The tendency to consumption where
there is no hereditary predisposition, may
be acquired from the effects of colds and
other diseases, and from various circutn-j
stances that destroy health.
4. One thing is quite certain, that every
thing that tends to break up the!
general health and strength, may either
produce turbercles of the Lings, or to develope
those which already exist. With,
a view to prevention, if you maintain the
general strength of the children of fanii-l
lies where consumption prevails, and also!
in adults, you will prevent the occurrence
of the disease; break up the general
strength and the disease will be develop- j
ed.
5lh. Another cause that predisposes to,
or excites consumption, is a cold and va- j
liable temperature. Consumption pre-j
vails most in countries where the atmos-j
phcre is variable. Hence, it is remarkably
prevalent in this country.
Oth. Another occasion which predisposes
to it, or excites it, is local irritation,
especially in the lungs. llence the lung
complaints of those who breathe air that
is filled with particles of dust and poison1
ous gasses.
! 7th. Copious evacuations will produce
consumption. Large losses of blood
break up the strength very much, ami
I when the least tendency to co sumption
| exists, it is very apt to supervene. Mo'
therS thus become consumptive by *uck:
ling their children too long, and losing
their rest at night.
8lh, Might-watching is one tiling which
breaks up the strength remarkably. If u|
young lady who is consumptive, lias two
or three sisters, never allow either ??I'
them to perforin the office of nurse for
the patient; If you do, consumption is almost
sure to follow. Two or three persons
in t.ne family have died, one after
another, from the combined effect of anxiety
of mind and night-watching, on persons
predisposed to cons'iiupti n, independant
of the inhalation of the od- r
from the patient's breath.
9ih. Another condition which breaks
up the strength is disorder of the stomach
liver and bow Is, and this is one of the
frequent occasions of consumption.
I lOih. A very frequent "ause in females 1
is tight-lacing. Any thing which prevents I

Rapidity of Communication.?We have
been ptrmitltd to make extracts from the
official logbook kept at the Live, pool telegraph
office ; and by it we arc in po*
session of instances of such extraordinary
rapidity of communication exactly at
one o'clock, through the whole line from
Liverpool to Iiolyhend, in order that the
different signal men may regulate their
time pieces. This is done by a peculiar
signal, made exactly as the clock strikes
one, which notifies the time, and asks the
question, 44 Is there any thing to report ?" '
An acknowledgement to this is returned,
either 44 yes" or 44 no," as the case may
be. The distance from Liverpool to Holyhead,
from station to station, is 7'Z miles;
hence there and back, 141 miles, and this
signal and answer is considered unusually
1 :r \\' u *i
lung ii it ut i:iJ|>ii'S (MIL' miuuir. u iiiiu
from the extracts abovementioned, thai
in the munlh of September, in which, by
the-by, we have had much stormy ami b?id
weather, this signal has been sent on IS
different days. The distance the signal
must have passed in those 18 times, must
I be 1,529 miles, which has been done in
the incredibly short space of 16 minutes
and 5 seconds, being an average oT 161
I > . * ^ i* .1 a
miles per minute, in 1/ 01 me clays 1
mentioned, the distance 2.448 miles, the'
time occupied was 14 minutes 5 seconds;
average 175 miles per minute. In 11 of
the shortest periods, the distance was
1.584 miles; iimc occupied 7 minutes 5
seconds; average228 miles per minute. In
taking the fiive quickest communications
during the month, we find the distance to
have been 720 miles; the lime occupied 2
minutes 30 seconds; being an average of
238 miles per minute. The shortest time
during the month was on the 10th, when
the signal passed, and the answer was returned
in 25 seconds. When it is considered
that there arc 11 different telegraph
stations, and only one mar, gt ea:h station,
this will appear the more extraordinary, 11
and speaks favorably of the management 1
of Untenant Watson, under whose super-J
intendence the telegraph was first established,
and still continues.?Liverpool
Courier.
Great Discovery in Surgery.?An
article has appeared in one of the Wall
street journals (the Express) by which it
seems there is some hope that the consumption
may be cured by suroical
means. The surgeon who makes this i
communication, purposes to cure the consuniptin
(in any case where one of the j
lungs is affected) Hi the following manner , j
?An incision is made between the ribs,
ami an orifice opened to admit the air in- j'
to the chest outside of the diseased lung? |1
so that no air will be drawn into that I a tig''
through the windpipe at all. The lung i
will collapse, and remain perfectly quics-il
cent and in that state can be cured by the j
- d\m - - ** "
euoris 01 nature alone, or removed altogether.
As tiicrc is a partition between
the sides of the lungs, while one of them '
ceases its action, the other goes on with <
its ordinary functions. The operation is 1
neither difficult nor painful, and may be
performed upon a person in the last sta- ,
ges of consumption, without danger?as
a person in that state would bear the operation
better than one in robust health.?
The plan appears to he feasible, from the
very fact that nature does sometimes effect
a cure by the very same process (drying
up one lung) and it is the only method hy j
which a cure is ever effected. If this t
plan succeeds it will he the greatest <1 is- (
covcry in the art ol healing, in modern i
times. 1
Virtues of Lime.?The usual applica- (
tion in India to a fresh wound; is that of
slacked lime. A late traveller in that coun- '
try, who sojourned sometime among the
natives in the interior, says:
" A musselman who was in our employ
was breaking w..ol,ihe head of the hatchet ,
came off, and the sharp edge fell with
considerable force on the poor creature's
foot; he hied profusely and fainted: lime
was unsparingly applied to the wound, the
foot carefully wrapped up, and the man
conveyed to his hut on a charpoy (bedstead)
where he was kept quiet without disturbing
|the wound : at the end of a fortnight he
walked about, and in another week returned
to his labor. Lime is an article of great
service in the domestic economy of the
natives. I have experienced the good effects
of this simple remedy for burns or scalds:
equal prop- rtions of fime, water, and any j
kind ol oil, made into a thin paste, and immediately
applied and repeatedly moistened,
will speedily remove the effects of a born; J
and if applied later, even when a blister
J has arisen, the remedy never fails ; I cannot |
!say how it might act on a wound the consu-'
jquences of a neglected burn."
1 The Perpetual Motion exhibited iti
Boston, admittance 50 cents, is a rascally
I humbug. The motive power is a live
| Yankee, who plays the poodle dog in the ;
cellar, and turns t crank which has a concealed
connection with tne machine. The
imposition was detected, as ;ve learn from
the Post, by Mr. M. Pond, machinist,
who examined the affair 011 Friday, and
suspecting the trick, stole quietly into
the cellar, and seeing a place hoxed up,
with a door, lie gave a gentle tap, and the
inmate, supposing him to he one of the
initiated, opened ' Sesame," and lo and 1
behold! there was the crank, and a man,
who ai length confessed that he was the
gentleman who turned it! i
