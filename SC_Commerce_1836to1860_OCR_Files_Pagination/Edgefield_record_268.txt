Ertract from 1fr. Duane's late pu-'lication,
entitled a -Nirrative and Correspondence
conce--ing ihe Rieoral of ti Deposites,
and occurrences connected thcrewith:
P HiLIVLriIA, Nov. 3, i3%
I need not fror my general purpose, stop
here to coneider, whether the U. :. bank
really wa-.s a regulator of thii paper cur
rency; and yet, I will brien15 consider that
point. To show, that it never did restrain
the issue of paper as money, all that is
needful is, to state undisputed facts; that, in
1791, there were but three banks; but there
are now upwards of sis hundred: and then,
duri-ig forty of the intervening forty-six
years, the U. S. hank was in operaion.
The proposition, that the U. S. bank vas
an eflicient regulator. is, therelre, erro
neous. It may have kep: out of circula
tion, as much paper of other banks. as its
own amounted to; but that portion wts in
significant, when conpared with the mass.
]esides. the U. S. batk had no such pa
triotic design as has been attribiteil to it.
If it excluded local bank pa per, it was not
because that paper mturiously allected the
public. but because its cireuflation interfer
ed with its own'profits. Instteail of inter
rupting the mischievous issue of local bank
paper as money, it added to the volume
of the current, which ultinatelv Mwept us
ott the breakers, n here we now are.
.My design. however, is not to diseniss thiet
point. I desire to keep your attention Iixed
upon a more important one, amn1Mely-t hat,
aecording tt the statement of the friends of
the U. S. hank themselves the original and
true source of existing evils, was the unre
strained issue of paper money. And now.
Jet me ask, who are accountable for this
state of things'? We all pirofes< to revere
thent and their labours! Loud are otir
boasts of attachment to the constitution!
Let us see; whether we reallN know n hat
tile labours of the framers (f the 'ontuIti
tion were. and wheiher we have not miost
shamefully uceglected both precept and ex
am ple.
The franers of the constitttion declared
their object to be, "to promote the gener
al welfare." Were they wi-we and skilfil,
as well as virtuous? Or, were they in
cornpetent to execute what they tider
took to perform? Afier laboutrin ;it oar
public edifice, did they leave it unhiaihid!
Did they suppose, that it would ttudb
down, utnlcss supported byI i te pruvs .f
chartered hauk4? Did they erouider 1
bankwiteel necessary, to keep in muotiui
the machinery which they had made,un-'.
that without it, tihe nin-hitery wtil
stand still! Did t hey sut-poe, that inn
gress would be cormipellud. to si il n par, !
the sovereign power over the curren-y, io
private and irresponsible persons, antl it)
give them tle puill~c none*y to trade ti I-i.
inl order to keep that tonev* safely?
If such'is the tri, characaterof or puhui
cal edifiee. and ifour pu blic agrot~ are such
knaves. that the public money annot I:,
safely leti, Air a short time. iti the'r hfat:,
the world has been sadly inposed uponi:
and, ottrs cannot he a "metolel reputelie."
But those, who built that erdifiee were -
ful as well as honc;t workmen: and Iei
none of the consequent shami- rest -upon
dhem, if their stccessors, itn the publie er
vice, are not as hotnest as theinselves. l'h
frainers of our cot itution, I repeat. were
wise. They well knew, how humati hap
piness could be promoted. and tly tid :l,
that it was possible for them to do. to in
sure its duration. They were aware, that
the soil, labiour anid money were eleme-nts
of riches, or of those things whlivt' montri
bmute to human welfme-thatt those. thiungs
are increased, iu pro portioni to thle fac-iliti-s
of exchtatges & exchanges are mutltiplii,
accordling tot the confidence,that; for pirodnue
.tionis,m~ouCy may be ha~d on dtemnd. l hiey
were acquainted witht the miigty resontees
oif their count ry,and. wvith the imitport ;tnce of
the use of the~ precious mnetail. for their
developmcnt. They ktnew tat aill wise
states, by the regulation of commerce andc
by treaties. sought to keep in cir-cubitiont
an abundanice of coini; and they had every~
reason to su1ppose, that the metal< in cir
culation th ouighoutt the wvor-ld wonhIdl b

knew, that a system of commniercial credit,
prevailed in Europe, whicht, without 'lie
aid of paper of banks of circulat ion. ati
swered all the purposes of tradhe. Thtty
knew, that bank paper.issuied ais loans, is a
fictitious capital: that it swells the circ-u
lating medium beyond the trite want oif
trade-enhatices the price of commoities
...-and drives coin out of circulation, it
short, they had had a satd e xperience of'th
mnischiiefs of a. pa per e-urreincy; amtI tdid till
that they cotld do, to secure to posterity
something more than a mere piromiise of an
equivatlent.
WVitht this view, and poseessed oif ihis
knowledge, the framers of our coinstituttion
conferred uiponi congress the power to reg
itlato commerce, andI prohibit atny t-:x upon
exports. Tolinsure the piresenice and pu
rity of coin, they forbade the several states
to issue bills of credit, coiin money, or
make any thing but golil aind silver a le
gal tendler. To maintain a metallic cur
rency, and to protect the users of it, con
grtess alone was authorized to coin money,
regulte its value, and punish counterfi
ing~ They also provided,that all duties, im
pot and excises shouild be tiniform through
out the Union. Int short, the framers of
our constitution considered the guardian
ship of the stitaidard of value, the univer
sally received equivalent. thie measure of
all commodities, atmong the attributes of
the sovereiatnty of all states united; aiid
they did allithat they could do, to prevent
usurpation, or intefe'rence with it, ott the
part ofany of the several states. So ioi
tent were they upon making the currency
of their own country: so -little inclinaution
htad they, to imitate the parenteountry, in
its establishment of the bank of England,
that they refused to grant to congress the
power to create a corpioration. -
Such, try good sir, was the anxiety. the
wisdom, anid the foresight of the fratmers
of onir constittion. They never enter
tained; nor has any person everentertain
ed, the notion. that producetionis were to be
carted from place to pltace, for the puirpo
ses either of society oir oh governent.
They niever supposed, that true credit cou
sisted oh, or depended upon, paper issue as
money. They well knew, that bianking,
it trer signifient ina. w as not a tmodernu
invention. hut liat it had existed in tie
earliest ages, of which we have inturma
tion; that exchanges had been at all times
ellecied, through hankers if deposite; that
notes of' banks of circul.ition are not the
instrumtnts, for effeeting exchanges be
tween the people of'one country and thlise
of any other; and, Ilerelore. they well sip.
posel. that all our excha.iges m ight be el
fecled by neans of' productions, bills of* ex
chanige, a;id coin.
And, yet. inl titter cotempt of all that
had been tihus done and forbidden, by the
franers of our constitution, the very evil.
and abuses, which they deprecated and
guarded against, have been almost ever
since i rank exi-tence and growit! Our
country has presetited the unexampled.
amd truly monstrou- existence of two so
vereiitnties, each sellina to chartered com
panies, p)owcrs, which the general sover
Ei::tty alone can rightfully exercise itself.
That is, eogIres5, to whoi the federal cott
veniit ion absolutely reliSwed to arant a power
to create a Porptiration, rievertheless erea
te( tie, and sells to it, wha't it has no right
to sell-a power to ikne pa per as tmoiev.
The several states, ton, ihonih poeitively
forbidden to issue hills of credii, or to coin,
mtoniey-that i., to moeddle with the cur
rency'-sell tochnirterel compa -nie a pow

Is it wonderfiul.ihen; that we hnve had ex

Fromn the N. Y Courier $- Enquirer.
Tn1.: SLAVlE dSiIPs.-%ve Ntaived yester
day tornion in a britef par agraih, that her
liritanie al ajesty's ship of war Buzzard,
Capi. Fia-zerall, had arrived in our har
hour froms Barhadoes, acconpainaed by a
prize ves-e'l. called the Eagle. which had
been eniptured while cruising as a slaver.
On inqairy, we learn that the Eagle,
witha atother vessel, were both eaptured by I
the Buzzard on the coast of Africa, while
engaged in the piratieal trallic. It does
not appear that any slaves have been ta
ken oa lhoard lie vessels, but they .were
founiad furnished with irons and all other
imiplateaients of the trade, and that subie
queat to' their capture, the officers and
crew admitted that they were aml had
been enuaged in the slave trade. The
vessels, it appears, are loth American
built, ani the olfic rs were all -Americans.
Vhen taken, they had the Spanish flag
flying. rie vessels were fitted out at Ha
vana. One of the captains, (their nanes
wa- hitave atL learned) is. ir seemas. a natave
of New Y-rk, and the other of Philadel.
phia. The other prize vessel is expected
a0 arrive daily, she having sailed itn com
pany with the Huzzard fromta Barbadoes in
charge of a British Prize Niaster.
Thie object of this visit to our harbor is,
we learn, to deliver over the ofli-nders to
our authorities for trial, and for this pUr
pose, negorintions are now pendinz be
tween the British officers and the magis
arates here. '
2 o'clock, A. M.-The other vessel cap
tored by the Buzzard has arrived. She is
called the Clera, andl was commanded hv
Captain Hooker. She was taken on ihe
coast of Africa, three months after the
capture of the Eagle,comiianded by Capt.
Leeting. The British offiers found that all
the original officers and crews of the two
vessels had idied of tle Const fever except
two or three Spaniards and the two Cap.
tains above named.
Captain [looker, is very ill, and not
likely to live more than a (lay or two -
lQaptain Leeting is in i(ood health, nod
has been lodged in the debtors' prison on
a writ issued by Judge etts, at the in
stane of Ciaptain Fitzgerald and Mr.
Buchanan, 11. B. Al. Consul.
Captain Fitzgerald will proceed imme
dinly to Washington, to obtain there the
necessarv intformtion in re;ard to the dis
po.sal of the prisnaers.

FRoM ST. AUGUSTUNE.-BV the 'arrival
yesterday afternoon ofthe packet schooner
Enpirr. Capt. L. Southnick, we have
received fromr our correspondent the fol
lowing:
HIERALD OFFiCE,
June 19, 1839.
Information has reached us thai t itum
her of indians have gone in nt Fort King,
and aniong them the party who murdered
Brockenberry, at Picolata a short timo
since. They admitted the murderand al
leged that they were ignorani of the treaty
entered into %ith Gen. Macomb.
Since then. however, the treaty has re
ceived another bloody seal. Two men
were killed last week at a place called fort
cross. The sixty dayb allowed for the In
rlians to go South, have not expired.
It is said a number are going South, but
it is sispecied it is for the purpose ofhold
ig the "green corn dance," which takes
place about the first week in July.
The Drought and the Heat.-The heat
iluring the last week has been exceedingly
ippressive. The theroometer ranging
lietween 93 and 98. The surrounding
country too, as well as our city, is suffer
ing under a droughtorseveral weeks. In
the city, garden vegetables are literally
parched and dried up. and in the surround
ing country, the corn is almost in the samo
situation, and ye, there are no prospects
nf rain. We understand that some 10 or
12 miles north of this place,on Friday night
last, there was a cevere hail storm which -
like the one that fell in te same direction,
a few weeks pastt has done a great deal of
diamage. Without there is an early rain,
the planters in this vicinity will lose their
erop of Corn and the Cotto'n will he mate
rially injured. A e trust however that the
1BENEFICENT B.Ixo," who in the exer.
?ise of his wisdom, orders all things for the
best. will vi..it our parched soil with a few
'f those "genial showers," wohnut which
lhe industrious Farmer toileth in vain!

The Circular.-The President of the
Bank of the United States, both in conver

,onnexion with the famouas circular.
.P. S. We have this moment received

To the Editors of ite Journal of Commerce.
I perceiveth nt.in commron with the other
'ewspatpers of hibi city, you have connec
ed my tiame and the Bank of the United
Siates with the Cotton Circlar recently
ssucd in this city. You will therefore
termit me to state explicitly;
That the Bank of ithe United States has
inihing whatever to do with it, so far as I
mow or believe.
That this measure didyot emanate from
lessrs. Hiiphreys & Biddle.
That with tihe view of facilitating tho
?xport of the Cotton now in this port, I of
ered to make the advances named in the
ircular alluded to.
That the reasons assigned for making
hipmeuts to Messrs. H umphreys & Bid

:ottoun ini tIs cotuntry; who seek to pro
ect their own interests by cotcer; of ac
