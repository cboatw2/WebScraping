Letter oJ R. M -F. T.UNs-TER. to his Con

1840.
GP:.rLwF.Y: I have received several
letters frotit friends, who desire to know
my opinion upon the Presidential ques
tion, and ato inquire into the truth (if the
report that I shall not he a candidate Pir
re-election. As I have not time to reply
to these letters severally, I beg leave to
make a general and public response to
them all.
The relation I bear to you will justify
me. I trust, in hereafter addressinz vo
more at length upon the present state of
parties, and my course in regard to theta.
For the present. I must content myself
with a reply to the interrogatories pro
pounded to me as brief as is consistent
with a clear exposure of nv op:minions.
I have taken no part in tho Presidential
canvas-, because I do tnt approve of eiit
erof the candidates. I claimt to be a re
publecan oftheold Virginia school, and I do
not recognise either General H arrism or
Mtr. Van Buren as an exponent of its
printciples.
No one supposes, I presume. that any
candidate who held the opittions of either
of them, could stand a three days' caivasl
for Congress it any republican district in
Virginia. I understand booth a having
approved the Proclamation and Fotce
bill. I believe boilt to be in favor efn
protectise Tariff. General Hlarrison sut
ported this poliey itn resolutions introduced
into the Ohio L'edisiire, and itt pulic
derlarationt: and Mr. Van Buren voted
not only for the Tariffol1828. whei lie was
instrucied. but also for that of 1824, when
he was inder no snch oldigrtion.
BothIt are committed I t hintk, to the
power or the Gen-ieral Government over
the subject of Iuterinal Itmpr.venmet but
Genteral Harrison the more deeply of the
two lie I believe, voted for the systeim
in all of its Ibriws: anl. althoineh MV r. Vat.
Buren oflten voted against such measures
in the Senate, yet le did tnot always do
so: and lie has signed bills as Presidet,.
which. i my opitnon, involve tihe princi
ple. Such are the Cumberland Ioad hill,
and the Harbor bill of 1838.
I refer here not otily to the general poli
cv of the latter bill. hut to particuilar
items which it contaitns. In ite general
bearinig it is liable. I bielieve, to all thle oh
jertieons which apply to any other systemt
of I nterntal Itiprovemnentts. If ws haive
the pouter to construct hairbors for coti
miercial, or ier other than natval pulrpoeses,
I do ntot see why we mxay tnot maake roads
and canials also.
Bitt i hes bill conmtained an item for the
imtepro etment eef the II tndsen ri' er abimve
ande belowv the poert oef Albatny. Now, this
would he emblracedl even within the linmi
ted negative phuieed n pon the syseem in thme
MIaysville veto, if I unaderstantd the printci
ple of t he Mlessnge.
Uponi the Currency questiotn, however,
there is a mtarked diflereice in their opin-.
ions. Genieral [Harrisoen will si::n a: bill
for a United States Banik, shou~tld Coni
gress pass it; wheilst Mr. Van Butrene wetld
not only veto such at charter, bitt advo
cates what is commnonly known asm the
Sub-Treasury system. .It my be ask
ed, Why, then, will you not vote for
him, as he acrees "ith yott ott that im-i
potant measure? In a fisenl poinit ofC
view, no onec desires n.ore earnesty thant
tnyself an entire septarattion between ti
Gotvetnmtent ande banks of issue. Neer,
when viewed io its peolitical asptect, am I
behinde any itn lie wish to divorce the pow
er of thme banks fr-omt the patronage oif tIs
Government. Bi what avails the Sub.
Tr~ieasury, in this lamier pocint of view, if
we are to subljeet the State beanks to the
conitrol of this Governmettt, under the
fhrmt of a batik law-eundereds ofl Statte
banks woutled thus he plaedt under the
power of the General Gorvernmttetnt, and. itn
certain coat ingetncies, lun tdreds ofmnillions
in money wuld be admiiiniste-red bey feder
al agents. What sort oef divorce is that
which makes the State beanks depenedent
upton thins Government for their very ex
istenice, and which subject them to its reg
ulationi?
And vet the President recommendred, in
1S3,/ utnnifrrr law- neeniner hnntiren
cien of corporations and other bankers,
"I hrough whose instrumentality a saluta
rv cheek might he imposed upon the is
supe of paper money-"
I never entertainel a doubt of she dan
gerons tendency of such tin attempt tu
transfer the reg'ulation of the i-sues of the
State banks to thia Government. from the
day the reeommendation was made. But,
with great deference o the opinioins of the
President and other high anthorities. I
thought the nropositinf so extravagant that
there conld lie no dinger of it, adoption,
and that lie himiself wo upl. pon "a shet
second ihougjh,."reject it Bit recent events
have admonished me that it may become
a meaqure or serious and dangerous im*
mi nene-v. There is a not her question. how
ever, co'nnected wio h the currencv, eif more
danger in my opinion: I mean the Usited
Stntee Rank~. A bankrstpt lan% might hei
rrtienled: hut 'i( charter of a bank Must
continue througliout the periodi prescribed
for its existence.
The banking system wouli be thus re
orateized with t power vhich it would lie
almonst vain to resist. For this reasoit I
shold vote for Mlr. Van Buren, if I voted
at all. but I eanminot consent to vote for either.
I will not indulge thesaldow ofra prefer
ence, and thnie disarmn nyselfefr :ll pow.
er to ompose him hereafter upon great and
fit 'nmental qnestions- qiestions of the
nmot vital interest to you and to tne.
What right sho hil I have hereafter to op
pose either of these candidates who might
he elected in part by my vote, if lie were
to proposie to reinstitute the tariff or advo
cated n svstem of internal improvement?
If 1 befieved that their principles au
thorized sich a course when I voted for
them, could I complain if they afterwards
pursued it? It is in vain to say that I
shsosuld he excusied for opposing them by
alleging th:it I voted in the alternative of
evils, Mv vote, with a previous know
ledge of their opinions, would disarm me
f all moral power in opposition. Who
note talks to the people of this electiot as
a choice between evils? The friends of
each candidate represent him as faultle s
to their constituents, and they will h
rharged bv theim nith desertion if they
hoin'd oppoSe their man for doing, after
he election what they knew lie had done
lefire it.
For one. I am not prepared to take the
-espontihilityr or the frure acts of either of
hem, nor am I willing to inde ititmself
vith either. We belong to different schiool
n poliuics: I am a strict constructionisi. aind

zpe .k not of n hat shosii he the course of

will govern my own.
It is known to yio n tht I have general
ly acted with thise Of the States right par

Proclamatiion. I was with them in the
gloomiest period of their poliiical depress
ion, and if they had made no mere per
onal issues, or if they had made these i
stes upon men of their own way ofr hink
ing. I should lie with them now. But, if
the vote for the Prsidency is to he made
the test of political fellowship, atn if(Gen.
Harrison is to he their candidate, I mit-t
submit to the destiny which divides us. I
know of no question on which the Sintes

of his vote as to men.
I mysaelf have never cotnsidered the vote

that a tman shouldl carry ouit hsis princitple,

I like him i tie biener for it.
In these opinieoe, heowever, I staind per

Tf I were to do so, I should subject my
self to the suspicion of tiimming between
the two parties, known to be nearly divi.
- ded in the district which I have the hnno
to represent. As my own conscience ac
quits nie or such a motive, I must so regu
late my conduct as to give no coutilenanel
to the suspicion. This I can only do b
abandoning all claims (if any I have) Ii
public lire. In this I claim no credit fo
any sacrifice, as in truth, I make none it
abandoning whatever political prospects
may have had. I s;hould never come her
to serve myself, and I could not think o
offering to serve you unless I believed tha
I could do it to your satisfaction.
I hope my motive in thns abandonin:
all clairis to your public trusts will not h
misuiderstood. There is no man wh<
values your approbation more than I do
none I trust can be more crateful ihin I
am for the confidence with which you hav
hoiored me. and no one, I nin sure, couk

it is my own private vote non which ti

lispose of that ureording to the obligationi

thik particlar. I am placed in a position
in which I have to choose I)eineen my
laims to your public i trusts and your con
fiience in my private honor; of the two. I
prefer the laitter. If it were in my powe
to be re-elected, I could not return under
the pledge to represent your principles,
and at the same time support either hiar
rion or Van Buren: for, in my opinion,
if I were to do the one, I should he likely
to fail in the other. It wrould be n rong,
tlierel'ore, for tne to promise what I lieliev

have doubted whether it was not my hity

I p'roceed to aniswer the qitestiOnts in the

the Executive of the Utnited States by thi
Consititiot, should be used with a sin
gle eye to the pulic adyantage, and no
to promote the interests of a party: indent
that the President of the United States

You are at liberty to use this letter for
in any purpose you may think proper.

s; Now, the General's letter to Mr. Evans
d is something more than two years later
i- in date, and is more likely to indicate his
n latest opinions.
d Ii this letter be understood as conveying
y his present opinions, how is it that J. C.
n C lark, Truman Smith, Leverett Salton
Il stall, Wim. Slade, and all the band of
r! pledged Abolitionists in Congress. give
it him their support? They all, as one
il miao, have pledged themselves to promote
x the abolition of slavery in the Distriet of
Columbia, which, int his letter of 1836, t
General Harrison says they have no right
k to do. If they he honest, how can they
i support him. nuless he has given some pri.

Extraordinary Discovery ofan Ancient
rinting Press 'in India.-When Warren
lastiiw was Go% ernor General of India,
e observed that in the district or Blnares,
little below the surface of the earth, is to
'e found a stratum of a kind of fibrous
moden substance, of various thicknesses,
i horizontal layers. Major Roebuck, in
irtmed of ihis, went out to a spot w%-here an
xcavation had been made, displaying this
i gular phenomenon. In digging some
hat deeper for the purpose of further
march, they laid open a vault, which soon
xaminaiion proved to beofsome size, and
>their astotishment. they found a kind of
rinting press, set up in the vault, and on
uoveable types, placed as if ready for
rintiun,-Every inqtiry was set on foot to
certain the probable period at which sch
n instrurnet could have been placed

rigin, and from all the Major cotuld col.

"A letter has been received from Major

ajority of 187 in the parish of Claiborne,

Il1 this confirms us in the belief that Mir.
