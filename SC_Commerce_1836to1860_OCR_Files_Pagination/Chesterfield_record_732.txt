for the benefit of all would thus operate |
for the benefit of the few?a result wholly i
uncongenial with the spirit of our institii
Irons, and anti-republican in all its tendenrie.s.
The .warehousing system would
enable the importer to watch the market,
and to select his'own time for offering his
goods for sale. - A profitable portion of the
carrying trade in articles bntcred for the
benefit of! drawback must also be most
seriously affected, without the adoption of
some expedient to relieve the cash sys
tern. The warehousing system would afford
that relief, since tho carrier would
have a safe recourse to the public storehouses,
and might, without advancing the
duty,re-ship within some reasonable period 1
to foreign ports. A furthe* etTect of the I
measure would lie-to stiperce it the system \
of drawbacks, thereby effectually protcc- j
t?ng the Government against fraud, as t
the right of debenture would hot attach to
goods after their withdrawal from the
public stores."
In revising the existing tariff* of duties,
should you deem it proper to do so at your
present session, I can only repeat the suggestions
and recommendations which, j
upon several occasions, I hare heretofore
* felt it to he my "duty to offer to Congress.
The great, primary, and controlling interest
of the American People is union?
, union not only in the'mere forms of Gov-;
ernmeof, forms which may he broken? ;
but union founded in an attachment of
States and individuals for each other.?
This union in sentiment and feeling can
1 only he preserved by the adopfien of that
course of policy which, neither giving exelusive
benefits to some nor imposing unnecessary
burdens upon ethers, shall coneult
tlie interests of all, by pursuing a
course of moderation, and thereby seeking
to harmonise public opinion, and
causing the People every whereto feci
and to know that the Government is carc'
fulofthe interests of all alike.. Nor is
there any subject in regard to which mod.- i
eration, connected with a wise disciimi- :
nation, is more necessary than in the im-!
position of duties on imports. Whether
reference be had to revenue, the primary 1
object in the imposition of taxes, or to the
incidents which necessarily flow from their;
imposition, this is entirely- (rue. Extra- i
vaganf fluties defeat their end and object, J
not only by exciting in the public mind a 1
hostility tothemanutacturing interests, out
radncing a system of smuggling on an
i-xtensivo scale, and the practice o? every
manner of fraud upon tlie revenue, which
theutmost vigilance of Government cannot'
suppress. An opposite course of policy!
would be attended by results essentially)
different, of which every interest of socio. >
tv, and none more than those of the manufacturer,
would reap important advantages.
Among the most striking of its benefits
would be fhaf -derived from the general
acquiescence of the country in its suppo. t, 1
and the consequent permanency and stability
which "would be given to all the op.
orations of industry. It cannot be too i
^ often repeated, that no system of legislation
can bo wise'which is fluctuating and i
uncertain. No interest can thrive under ;
if. The prudent capitalist will never adventure
his* capital in manufacturing cs- j
"lablish'ments, or in any other leading pur- ,
suit of life, if there exists a state of uncer- '
tainty as to whether the Government will I
repeal to morrow what it has enacted Xo- !
day, Fitful profits, however high, if j
threatened with a ruinous rcductioq by a
vacinating policy on the part of the Gov- !
eminent, will scarcely tempt him to trust
the wioney which has been acquired by a
life of labor upon the lincertaja adventure.
I therefore, in the spirit of conciliation. ;
and influenced by no other desire than to j
rescue the great interests of the country!
from the vortex of political contention, j
and in the discharge of tl e high and solemn
duties of the placo which I now occupy,
recommend moderate duties, imposed
with a wise.discrimination as to their
KeVeiftt"objects, as being not only most
hk-plv In he durable, hut most advanta*
geous to every interest of society.
The report of the Secretary of the War
Department exhibits a very full and satis
factory account of the various and important
interests committed to the chnrgc of'
that officer. It is particularly gratifying!
to find that the expenditures for th'c milr
lary service are greatly reduced in amount; .
" that strict system of economy has been
introduced into the service, nitd the nhusea
of past yca.s greatly reformed. The
fortifications on our maritime frontier'
have been prosecuted with much vigor,
und at many points our defences arc in a |
very considerable state of forwardness.? |
The suggestions in reference to the esta?
?
blishmcnt of means of communication
with our territories on the Pacific, and to
the surveys so essential to a knowledge of
the resources of the intermediule country,
are entitled to the most favorable consideration.
While I would propose nothing
inconsistent with friendly negociations to
. nettle the extent of our claims in that re.
gion, yet a prudent forecast points out the
necessity of such measures as may enable
us to maintain our rights. The arrangements
made for preserving our neutral
relations on the boundary between u?and
- Texas, and keeping in check the'Tndians
in that quarter, will be maintained so long
as- circumstances may require.
For several years angry contentions '<
have grown out of the disposition directod <
by law to Be made of tho mineral lands >
held by the Government in several of the <
States. , The Government is constituted <
the landlord, hik! the citizens of IheSiates i 1
wherein lie the lands are its tenants.? 1
The relation is an unwise one, and it would 1
be much more conducive of the public I
interest that a st.ie of the lands should be t
made than that they should remain in 1
their present condition. The supply of t
the .ore would be more abundantly and '
certainly furnished when to he drawn c
from the enterprise and the industry of I
the proprietor than under tho present sys- t

The recommendation of the Secretary!
rn regard to the improvements of the H'es-,
tern waters and certain prominent harb%rs :
on the lakes, merit, and I doubt not will i
... i
receive your serious attention. Thegreat j
importance ofthese subjects to the prosper- j
ity of the extensive region referred to, and
the security of the whole country in time*
of war, cannot escape observation. The t
losses of life and property which annually j
-occur in the navigation of the Mississippi I
alone, because of the dangerout obstruc-)
tiona in the river, make b loud demand
upon Congress for the adoption of efficient
measures for their removal. !
The report of the Secretary of the Na- i
vy will bring you acquainted with that j
important branch of the public defences.;
Considering the already vast and daily in- j
creasing commerce of the country, apart i
from the exposure to hostilo inroad of an '
extended seaboard, all that relates to the j
navy is calculated to excite particular at - j
tention. Whatever tends to add to its
efficiency, without entailing unnecessary
charges upon the Treasury, is well worthy
of your serious consideration. It will be '
seen that while an appropriation exceed- j
ing by more than a million the appropria- j
tions of the present year, is asked by the
Secretary, yet that in "this sum is proposed
to be included S lOO.OOCf for the purchase j
of clothing, which, when once expended, I
will be annually reimbursed by the sale of;
thcNclothes, and will thus constitute a per- i
petual fund, without any new appropriation
to the same object. To this may
also bo added $00,000, asked to cover the j
arrearages of past years, and $250,000 in :
urder to maintain a competent squadron ,
on the coast of Africa ; all of which, when j
deducted, will reduce the expenditures
nearly within the limits of thoso of the
current year. While, however, the ex- ;
penditures will thus remain very nearly
the same as of the antecedent year, it is
proposed to add greatly to the operations
of the marine, and in Leu of only t wenty. I

the way of building, to keep, with the <
same expenditure, forty-one vessels afloat,!
and to buildtwelve ships of a small class, j
A"strict system of accountability is es- i
tablished, and great pains-nro token to en- !
sure industry, fidelity, and economy in 1
every department of duly. Experiments
have been institr.ted to test the quality of
various' materials, particularly copper,;
iron, and coal, so as to prevent fraud and
imposition.
It will appear bv the report of the Post- i
master General that the great point which, I
for several yeare, has been so much desi-'
red, has within the current year been ful- j
ly accomplished. The expenditures of
the Department fcr the current yo*r have
been brought within its income without 1
lessening its general usefulness. There !
has been an increase of revenue equal to
$166,000 for the year 1812 Over that of
1841, without, as. it is believed, any addition
having been made to the number of
iettcrsand newspapers transmitted through
the mails. The Post Office laws have
been honestly administered, and fidelity
has been observed in accounting for and j
paying over, by the subordinates of the I
Department, the moneys which have beenreceived.
Tor the details of this service i '
refer you to the report.
1 flatter myself that the exhibition thus
made of the condition of the public aclministiation
will serve to convince you
that every .proper attention has been paid
to the interests of the country by those
who have been called to the heads of the
different Departments. The reduction in
the annual expenditures of the Govern
mcnt already accomplished, furnishes a!
sure evidence that economy in the au. iication
of the public moneys is regarded (
as a paramount duty. t

with a soil fertile almost beyond example,
and a'country blessed with every dversity
of climate and production, what remains j
to be done in order to advance ihe hr?ppi j
ncss and prosperity of such a People ?.
U^clcr ordinary circumstances this inquiry
could be readily answered. The best ,
that probably could be done for a people j
inhabiting such a country would bo to for-1
tify their peace arid security in the pros-!
ccution of their various pursuits, l>y guar- j
ding them against invasion from without j
and violence from within. The rest, for j
the greater part, might be left to their own I
energy and enterprise. The chief embarrassments
which at the moment exhibit
themselves have arisen from over action,
and the most difficult task which, remains
to be accomplished is that of cor
reeling and overcoming its effects. Dec
o
tween the years 1S33 and I83S additions
were made to hank capital and hank j
issues, in the form of notes designed recirculation,
to an extent enormously great.
The question seemed to. be, not how.the
best currency could be provided, but in j
what maifncr the greatest amount of bank ,
paper could be put in circulation. Thus j

that such extensive shipwreck !
should have been made of private fortunes, j
or that difficulties should exist in meeting !
their engagements on the part of the debt- !
or States. Apart from which, if there be j
taken into account the immense losses
sustained in the dishonor of numerous
banks, it is less a matter of surprise that
insolvency should have visited many of,
our fellow-citizens than that so many
should have escaped the blighting influence
of the times.
In the solemn conviction of these truths,
and with an ardent desire to meet the
pressing necessities of the country, I felt
it to be my duty to cause to be submitted j
to you, at the commencament of your laic \
session, the plan of an Exchequer, the j
whole power and duty of maintaining ;
which, in purity and vigor, was to be exercised
by the Representatives of the peopie
and the States, and therefore virtually
by the People themselves. It was proposed
to place it under the control and direction
of a Treasury Hoard, to consist of
three commissioners, whose duty it should
he to see that the law of its creation was ;
faithfully executed, and that the great end 1
of supplying a paper medium of exchange, i
at all times convertible into gold and sil- i
ver, should be attained. The Board thus j
constituted was given as much permanen- j i
oy as could he imparted to it without en- ;
daggering the proper share of responsibili
ty which should attach to all public I
agents. In order to ensure all the advan- |
tages of weil-iriatured experience, the com- i
missioners were to hold their ofiices for 1
the respccti?e periods of two, four, and jl
six years, thereby securing at oil times in i
the management of trie Exchequer the j
services of two men ofexperience, and. to 1
place them in a condition to exercise per- i
feet independence of mind andaction.it I
was provided that their removal should <
only take place for actual incapacity or 1
infidelity to the trust, and to be followed i
by t he President with an exposition of the |
causes of such removal, should.it occur. I
It was proposed to establish subordinate i
boards in each of the Stales, under the i
same restrictions and /imitations of the ; I
power of removal, which, with fhe central I
board, should receive, safely keep, and i
disburse the public moneys; nnd, in order , |
to furnish a sound paper medium of ex- i
change, the Exchequer should retain of i j
the revenues of the Government a sum not I
to exceed 85,000,000 in specie, to be set j
apart as required by its op<?rations, and to i
pay the public creditor at his own option '
either in specie or Treasury notes, of de- I
nominations not less than five nor exceed- j
ing one hundred dollars, which notes j <
should be redeemed at tiie several places j l
of issue, and be receivable at all times and i
every where in payment of Government |
dues; with a restraint upon such issue of i
hdls that the same should not exceed the J
maximum of 8.15,000,000. In order to : i

fluctuations in trade, the Secretary of the J
Treasury was invested with authority to i
issue $3,000,000 of Government stock, <
should the same at any time be regarded t
as.ncqessary, in order to place beyond ha- I
zard the prompt redemption of the bills j <
which might L. thrown into circulation ; I
thus in fact milking the issue of 815,000,- ! <
000 of Exchequer bills rest substantially ! i
on $10,000,000, and keeping in circula- J I
lion never more than one and ohe-imlf. t
dollar in specie. When to this it is added (*
ihaLlho bills arc not oi;!y every wh*?rc !(
receivable in Government dues, but that s
the Government itself would be bound : i
for their ultimate redemption, no rational , I
doubt can exist that the paper which the , i
Exchequer would furnish would readily t
enter into general circulation, and bo ; t
maintained at all times at or above par I
with gold, and silver; thereby realizing f
the great want of the age and fulfilling the I
wishes of the People. In order to reim- , I
burse the Government the expenses of the t
plan, it was proposed to irft'est the Exche- r
quer with the limited authority to deal in t
bills of exchange (unless prohibited by j i
the State in which an agency might be ! I
situated) having only thirty days to run, I *
and resting on a fair and bona fide basis, i c
The Legislative will on this point might '
be so plainly announced as to avoid all t
pretext for partiality or favoritism. It was p
furthermore proposed to invest theTreas- a
urv agent with authority to receive on deposite,
to a limited amount, the specie i 1
funds of individuals, and to grant certlfi. f
cafes therefor, to he redeemed on presen- g
lation, under the idea, which is believed P
to be well founded, that such certificates P
would come in aid of the Exchequer bills j h
in supplying a safe and ample paper cir- ; I
:ulaliou. Or, if in placo of the cantcm- ! g
plated dealings in exchange, the Exc.hc- ; it
]aer should h'e authorized not only to rx- a
:IiaBge .its hills for actual deposites of spe- ?
:ie, but for specie or its equivalent, to sell tl
IrafU, charging therefor a small hut rea- i*
tunable premium, I cannot doubt but that C
he bene fits of the law would he speedily ?'
nanifested in the revival of the credit, fl
rade, and business of the whole country, tl
tiHtcrtaining tnis opinion, it becomes my
!uly to urge its adoption upon Congress, tli
iy reference to the strongest considerations hi
f the public interests with such altera
[ions in its details as Congress may in its!
wisdom see fit to make.
I am well aware that this proposed alteration
and amendment of the law establish- (
ing the Treasury Department has en-,
countered various objections, and that i
among others it has been proclaimed a
Government Uank of fearful mid dangerous
import. It is proposed to confer up-1
on it no extraordinary powers. It purports
todo no more than pay the dehts of i
the Government with the redeemable pa- i
per of the Government; in which respect j

irnent, lies between an exclusive specie *

ssues of some kind on the other. That *
hese issues cannot be made'by a char- | 1
ercd institution, is supposed to be conclu- j j
lively settled. They must be made, then,'t
lirecily by Government agents. For a
several years past they have been thus. ?
undo in. the form of Treasury notes, and ?
lave answered a valuable purpose. Their j 1
usefulness has been limited by their being I
ransient and temporary ; their censing ! r
o bear interest at given periods necessari- I f
y causes their speedy return, and thusit
estricts their range of circulation, and, *
jeing used only in the disbursements of f
Government, they-cannot reach those t
>oints where they are most required. By v
enduring their use permanent, to the mo- c
lerate extent already mentioned, by offer- c
ng no inducement for their return, and h

xtcnt, the general rtirrency so much ; s

dan, so far as it may operate iii furnishing i li
currency. ' . fn
I cannot forego the occasion to urge its ! a
mportance to the credit of the Govern, i a
nent in a financial point of view. The ! c
;rcat necessity of resorting to every pro- , h
er and becoming expedient in order to , o
lace the Treasury on a footing of the r;
ighest respectability, is entirely obvious, j C
"ho credit of the Government may be re- l o
arde.i as the very soul of the Government j N
self?a prjncipleof vitality without which i/
II its movements arc languid and all its ] is
perations embarrassed. In this spirit J ai
ie Executive felt itself bound by the most i nn
operative senso of duty to submit to J rt
Congress, at its last session, the propriety | w
f making a specific pledge of the land i A
ind, as the basis for the negotiation of ;
ic loans authorized to he contracted. I i m
icn thought that such an application of bj

nment, ample funds to relieve the Trea- of

ry docs daily at this-, time, in issuing to J
ihe public creditors the Treasury notes (
which, under law, it is authorized to issue. ;
It has no resemblance to an ordinary bank, 1
as it furnishes no profits to private stock- j
holders,'and lends no capital to individ. |
uals. Ifit bd objected to ns a Govern-,
ment Dank, and the objection be available,
then should all the laws in relation
to the Treasury be repealed, and the capacity
of the Government to collect what
is due to it, or pay what it owes, be abrogated.
This is the chief purpose of the proposed
Exchequer; and surely if, in the accom
plishment of a purpose so essential, it af- !
fords a sound circulating medium to the
country and facilities to trade, it should
be regarded as no slight recommendation
of it to publrc consideration. Properly
guarded by the provisions of law, it can (
run into no dangerous evil, nor can nnyj
abuse arise under it but such as the Legislature
it#eif vvifl be answerable for, if it bo !
tolerated?since it is but thecreatureof the
law, and is susceptible at all times of mo- i
dification, amendment, or repeal, at the I
pleasure of Congress. I know that it has (
been objected that the system would be li- '
able (o be abused by the Legislature, by j
whom alone it could be abused, fn the '
party conflicts of the day?that such j j
abuse would manifest itself in a chance ; <
' I
of the law which would authorize an ex- |
cessive issue of paper for the purpose of
inflating prices and winning popular fa- <
vor. To that it may bq^answered, that 1
the ascription of such a motive to Con- i J
;*ress is altogether gratuitous and inadmis. 11
iible. The theory of our institutions would J j
load us to a different conclusion. ISut a I
perfect security against a proceeding'so^ I
reckless, would be found to exist in the I
very nature of things. The political par- - I
ty which should b_c so blind to the true i
interests of the country as to resort to i
such an expedient, would inevitably meet i
with final overthrow in the fact that, the ;
moment the paper ceased to be converfi?Ie
into specie, or otherwise promptly releemed,
it would becomg worthless, and
would, in the end, dishonor the Government,
involve the people in ruin, and such
political party in hope less disgrace. At
the same time, such a view involves the
Litter impossibility of furnishing any currency
other than that of the precious metals;
for, if the Government itself cannot j
forego the temptation of excessive paper
issues, what reliance can be placed in cor. I;
porations, upon whom the temptations of 11
individual -aggrandizement would most :
ifrongly operate ? The people would have ! i
io blame none but themselves for any in- 11
jury that might arise from a course so J
reckless, since their agents would he the <
wrongdoers, and they the passive specta- : I
tors.
There can be but threa kinds of puhjjic j I
currency : first, gold and silver; second, j i
the paper of Stato institutions ; or, third, j '
i representative of the precious 'metals^ <
provided by the general Government, or <
under its authority. The sub-Trcasurv^lj
system rejected the last in any form ; nn J, j I
is it was believed that no reliance Could I '

sury from lite temporary embarrassments
under which il labored. American credit
has suffered u considerable shock in Europe,
from the large indebtedness of thy
states and the temporary inability of some
of them to meet the interest on their debts.
The utter and disastrous prostration of
the United States Bank of Pennsylvania,
had contributed largely to increase the
sentiment of distrust, by reason of tiro loss
and ruin sustained by the holders of its
stock, a large portion of whom were foreigners,
and many of whom were alike
ignorant of our political organization, and
of our actual responsibilities, ft was the
anxious desire of the Executive that, in
the effort to negotiate the loan abroad,
the American negotiator might be able to
point tho money lender to the fund mortgaged
for the redemption of the principal
1 c ?*?*? Iao ?i kz* mirrlif /?nn f m f

and thereby vindicate .the Government
from all suspicion of bad faith or inability
to meet its engagements. Congress differed
from the Executive in this view of
the subject. It became, nevertheless, the
duly of the Executive to resort to every
expedient in its power to negotiate the
authorized loan. After a failure to do so
in the American market, a citizen of high
character and talent was sent to Europe
with no better success ; and thus the mortifying
spectacle has been presented of
the inability of this Government to obtain
a loan so small as not in the whole to
amount to more than one-fourth-of its or.
duiary annual income; at a time when
the Governments of Europe, although involved
in debt, and with their subjects'
heavily burdened with taxation, readily
obtain loans of any hmount ut a grcutly
reduced rate of interest.
It would be unprofitable to look farther
into this anomalous state of things, but I
cannot conclude without adding that, for
\ Government which has paid off its debts
of two war-: wilh the largest maritime .
power of Europe, arid how owing a debt
which is.Almost next to nothing when .
compared with its boundless resources, a
Government- the strongest in the world,
because emanating from the popular frill, ,
and firmly rooted in the affection* of a ]
great and free people, and w^hose fidelity
to its engagements has never been ques- ,
tioned : for such a Government to have
tendered "to the capitalists'of other coun. (
tries an opportunity for a snlall ipvestinent
of its stock, and yet to have failed, j
implies either the most unfounded distrust |
in its good faith, or a purpose, to obtain
which, the course pursued is the most fa. <
tal which could have been adop'tcd. It
l it .1 i
tins now become obvious 10 an men, inai
the Government must look to ifsown means
for supplying its wants,'and it is consoling
to know that these means arc altogether
adequate for the ohjcct. The Exchequer,
if adopted, will gicatly aid in- bringing
about this result. Upon what I regard as
a well-founded supposition that its bills
would be readily sought for by tho public
creditors, and that the issue would, in a
short time, reach the maximum of 315,.
000,000, it is obvious that ?10,090.000
would thereby be added to the available
means of the Treasury without cost or <
charge. Nor can I fail to urge the great i
und beneficial effects which would be pro. i
juced in aid of all the active pursuits of <
life. Its effects upon the solvent State <
Banks, while it would force into liquida- i
Lion those of?n.oppu4ite character through i
its weekly. selUoments, would be highly <
irenelicial; and w ith the advantages c f a ?
soupd currency, the restoration of confi. <
lence and credit woufa follow, with a nu- "<
merous train of blessings. My copvic- t
lions are-most strong that these benefits ( >
ivoult] flow from the adoption of this mca? I
aire; but if the result should he adverser, <
[here is Mils security in connection with it,

mental rowE* vs. brcte force.
^ o saw the other day emphatically tlic rarest
instance of mental superiority triumphing1 over the hostility
of greater aninnd strength, that ever encountered
our observation. A thin, diminutive,
consumptive looking young fellow, lame, and
using a crutch, sat upon a packing box out on
the sidewalk, in front of a slop-shop on the levcc.
Another man of herculean frame was striding up
and down, swearing roundly at the little fellow. 0
and exhibiting every symptom of rage and fury.?
The huge bully beat the awning posts with a thick
stick that he held in his hand, and cast glances
like bowic knives at his quiet opponent on the box.
What the offence or cause of quarrel was, we
made no effor^o ascertain, but merely paused an
instant, attracted by the oddity of the scene.
The big fellow seemed to ben rough boatman,
and his abuse of the other was interlarded with
most outrageous vulgarity and blasphemy. ?
44 By , mister, I'd like to wring the necks .
of a dozen like you before breakfast," said the bully
boatman. ~
44 Sorry you can't be gratified," responded the
Httlc fellow, in a calm, quiet, cool and collected
manner,'and every tone l?e ut'orcd was a satirical
dagger to the other. > .
41 By , J C3n wring your, neck, any how."
44 For the matter of that, so could a child, if a *
child could bo brute enough to do it." >
, ?:D?n you, you're not worth flogging 1"
44 You arc, and that's all you are worth."
4' Maybe you'd like to flog me ?"
44 Well, I would."

Can't?aint got strength?wish I could, my \
friend, you shouldn't wait long for it."

you with a single blow." - /. *

The weak and emaciated young fellow, as his
chcmy approached him, merely curled his baggafr!
features into a sinile, and slowly lifted (be fore. .
finger of his right hand to point directly and-dc.
liberately at his advancing opponent.?We never
in the world knew so sudden and extraordinary an . .
effect produced in a manner so curious. The bullyjng
boatman actually turned pale, and went otf

Morning Meetings.?The Spaniards have a
ipccics'of public amusement (though it deserve# a *\Jk. ar
better name), which consists in the superior;lass
of the male inhabitants collecting, between,
en and eleven in the forenoon, in some public
iromenade or open apace. In Madrid the favortc
place of meeting is the Pucrta del Sol; in
Ioledo, the Zocodovcr; in Sc.ville, the Plaza dc
/ivarrarabla and the Zaealin. These assemblages
>ear a striking resemblance to the ancient forum * +
md ayopa : the subjecls discussed at them are .
tot merely private concerns, but the leading topics
f the day; and the groups who take part in the
itt6r, handle the matter in debate with a degree
f talent and ardour, as well as unsparing freedom,

icctings aro so dearly prized by the Spaniard,
