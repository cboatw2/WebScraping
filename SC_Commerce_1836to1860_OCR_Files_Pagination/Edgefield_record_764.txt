Com. Mockenie is not without somm high
precedents an land. Tihe writer sny:
-Without the advice of any one, Gen.
Washington ordered the heads of two de
eorters to be cut off, wl-ile his army was
quartered at Valley Forge. Gen. Wayte.
in his campaign against the conrederated
tribes of Nortiern Isdians, had mutineers
and deserters hung without thc form of a
trial. Simi. Johu P. McIntosh. while sta
tioned in Georgia, after the peace of 1783,
during a season profound tranquility. or
dered three deserters to be shot on parade,
without a trial; which proceeding was
investigated by a select committee or the
confederasted Congress and reported "jus.
tifiable." In 1818 Gen. Jackson cauLd

Cotoa.-The review of the Cotton
Market last wat:.k, kit it in n h-alty state-,
with advancing pric.:s. Simee tUILmI
operators have fully su-tained thoe pricn
and the market contiuues active. The
Sreceipts in the meautime have teen by
wagons and boats. Not more than one
half of the cottan crop has been bruagt
in yet; our receipts this year will amouat
to about 60,0t0 bales. Prices range Ito
day 5 to 7 cts; principal sales 5j to 6 ets.

Remarks.-The only effect which the
latest advice% from Europe has hadi otn tihe
American market", is stesdiness in prices,
and confidence in their maintenauce.
When those advices were received. their
was a disposition manifested by holder.
of cotton to establishm an advance on previ
ous rates; they succeded to a trifling extent.
But after a littlo rellexion, ani the relue
sance of operators to acced to the demand.
forgtr rates have since governed the war
ket -aid it now appears that a perfect
adestanding exists between sellers ani
,.re. It could not be asheurwise, if we
to the condition ofthe European mar
kits for the raw materials and minufac
tared'goods. In England the excitement
created by thbe China accounts had entirely
*subided. imehs been ascest-iued hat the
demand for manufactured goods, stuitable
for the China market, would tnt be so
great as it was first anticipated; and besides
at bas been found that with the smock or
Goodson hand, the qiuanttty 'weekly mans
ufactured would be auflicient to meet any
extra demand without auycextra produsc
tion. 'This circumstance all'ected lize raw
material, which did not advance as it was
seriously believed it would at one time; and
itis probable that the next adlvices5 wvii
represent the Liverpooml market us having
receded from the advance stated under time
date of the 2d of' January; but at the same
time we believe they will represent thaut
market as being in a quiet and steady
condition at tbc rates formerly obtained.
WVe fear, however, that tne overflow of
imports into the European ports, my
produce an unfavorable effect.. Many of tihe
vessels from this counmtry will begin to ar
rive at Liverpool and h aysre, in the latter
part ofJanutary and beginning of Febranry.
loaded with cotton of the stew crop; and :f
many of those vessels arrive aell at onc, the
trade may take advazntage of thbe circumn
stance to produce a decline. Speculia
tore may also influence the market.
Should therefor accounts be received! in
this country, justi after the uccuzrrenc~e of
the circusmstance-- .sated. representing~ a
decline, our merchaant,, interested itn saese
fluctuations, ought anot to be govr:sed, irn
future operatious, bmy such accounts frmmn
Europe. These fluctuations. till ise but
momentary. though, as we have f'requenutly
observed, it is out of the question lihr time
raw material to attains higher rates. with
out endangering existinig confidence in a
healthy and steady codition of the trade.
Cottoa.-For the last week time mnarket
has been active and sales to a considerable
extent bavo been effected, though the re
ceipts have not been as lage as heretofore
by tihe Rait Road. Muchs cos:oo -as
received by boats, but is mood raste quzan
tities by wagons. Sales h'ave hbeesn :nade
from warehouses at .4, 4l, 5, tom 5(: there
is very little pirime ins s.!irket; thIis quai~lity
wouldl cotmmnd 6 toi G4 sn age:re bales.
The principal sales were made at i'rice's
ranging from 51 to 5j. We renew our
recommendation to our friend-a in the enun
try to prepare thsemeselves for paceking tihere
cotton of the next crop in aquare ha~les.
The higher price they will get foe cotton
thus packet' would amply repay them in
one year for the e xpense of a screw, Wle
