THE FATHER'S REQUEST.
" I cannot leave you property," said a
kind father to one of his offspring, " hut I
will endeavor to provide the means for ,
your education. Learning, next to religion.
is, in my estimation, the object i
most desirable in this life. It will protect ;
you from poverty, and, if sanctified by
grace, will furnish you with the means of
usefulness. The lad hesitated, but at
length replied, ' Father, \ have no taste
for books, but I wish to gratify you. j
Since you desire it, I will study, and en- j
deavour to make up by perseverance w^iat
is wanting in love for the business." Tmc j
* father sighed, and doubted the result but j
thought it not prudent to express his apprehensions.
Trie bo3* returned to his books,
and applied himself with increased vigour ;
and assiduity. Before the lapse of many 1
months, he discovered the operation of a j
1>rinciple in his mind of which he had not ;
>efore been conscious. Unwonted sue- j
cess began at first to reconcile him to his 1
studies; shortly to render him fond of
iHem ; and at last, almost to infatuate
him in their pursuit. Had not religion
come in to moderate and direct his ambi- ,
lion, he would have become an enthusiast
in learning.
The resit ft is easily fold. He rendered ;
him*. If proficient in every study which he
undertook and became a man of erninf
nee and extended usefulness. Had he
followed the bent of his mistaken prejudi.
ces, he would pro'uibly have lived a com.
parativelv unknown and useless member
qi society.
CHRISTIAN PRR-OCCl'P VNCY OF MTNl?.
From a letter of Rev. Phi'ip Milledolcr.
J). I). New Brunswick, N. J., to the
American Tract Society.
The youthful mind, especially, needs
early and diligent culture. If it be not
pre-occupied?if the seeds of holv principle
and action be not early sown in it, the
enemy will sow tares, and the harvest will
be found, in most instances, to correspond ;
wiih such pre-occupancy. The comfort
of individuals?the happiness of families
?the well being of society?the efficiency
and permanency of our public institutions,
ecclesiastical and civil, and consequently
the security of the republic itself,
* M
are all most intimately connected mi in
this christian prc-occupancy.
" Under these circumstances there can
be but one voice, I would say, in this christian
community, on disseminating christian
knowledge, and that is, tin it, a*
promptly, as eytcnsively, and efficiently !
as possible.
"The idea of furnishing primary and
other schools with libraries of christian
knowledge I most cordially approve. I
believe it will be an important mean of
diffusing the influence of the gospel in
neighborhoods and families, and especially
in destitute and otherwise almost inaccessible
regions.v
FEARS OF UNBELIEVERS
VTliere is one thing, "said Mr. S., a
professed infidel, to one of his companions
in sin, "which mars all the pleasures of my
life." "Ah," replied his companion, "what
is that?" 'AVhy, I atn afraid the Bible is
true. If I could know for certain that
death is an eternal sleep, I should be happy;
mv jov would be complete. But here
is the thron that stings me? This is
the sword that pierces my very soul!
If the Bible is true I a?n lost forever!
Every prospect is gone, and I am lost forever!"
This unhappy man soon undertook
a voyage, was shiprccked and drowned
and most probably sunk into the mighty
deep in ail the horrors of absolute despair.
A Royal Wedding*
Mr Rush in his memoranda of a residence
at the court of London" gives the following
account of a Royal Wedding.
Aprit [1818.] The Princess Elizabeth
was married last evening to the Prince of
Hesse Homberg.* The royal family cabinet
ministers,* foreign ambassadors and
ministers, officers of the royal household,
persons in the suites of the royal dukes
and princesses, the archbishops of Canterbury
and York, the bishop of London, the
lord chancellor, the lord chief justice, and
u few others, were present. The Prince
Regent was not there, being ill. Our invitation
was from the Queen, given
through the Earl of Wiuchelsea, nearly
throe weeks before.
We got to the palace at seven o'clock. .
Pages were on the stairs to conduct us to i
I
(knrnnma Tho rorrmonv took olace in.
?MV IWIM - ? ?V I
the throne room. Before the throne was j
an alter covered with crimson velvet, on
which was a profusion of golden plate.
There was a salver of great size, on which
was represented the Lord's Supper. The
company being assembled, the bridegroom j
entered with his attendants. Then came
tlie Queen, on the aim of the Duke of
York, with the bride and royal family.
All approached the alter. Her majesty
sat; the rest stood. The marriage service
was read by the Archbishop of Canterbury.
The Duke of York gave the
bride away. The whole tyas according
to the forms of the Church of England,
and performed with great solemnity. A
record of the marriage was made. When
ail was finished the bride knelt before the
Queen to receive her blessing.
The consent of the king (or r?$cnt) and :
nriw council, is necessary to the validity j
r-' j * ->
of a royal marriage ill England. There
is another mode, where the party intending
to marry, and being of the male branch,
is of the age pf twenty-six. In such ease,
a record of the. intention on the books of j
the privy council will authorise the mar- j
riageat the expiration of a twelvemonth,
unless parliament interpose an objection. !
Soon aftej the service was performed,
the bride urefj bridegroom set off*for Wind- j
>*>r, the rest ?<f the cornpgnv remaining, i
The evening' passed in |iigh ceremony,
WrYiout excfii fling social case. From the
members of tl % rovfil family, the guests i
... , t
ha?| every measure of courtesy ; hut the I
whole demeanour of the Queen was re-1
markahle. Vhis venerable personage, the j
head of a large family, her children nt \
that moment clustering ahoot her; the |
female head of a great empire?in the seventy-sixth
year of her ago?went the;
rounds of the company, speaking to all;
no one did she omit. There was a kindli-;
ness in her manner, from which time had
struck away useless forms. Around her
neck hung a miniature portrait of the
king. He was absent?scathed by the
hand of heaven ; a marriage goir*| on in i
one of his palaces?he, the lonely, suffering
tenant of another. But the portrait
was a token superior to a croarn! It hespoke
the natural glory of #ifc and moth
er, eclipsing the ?rttficial glorv of Queen.
For more than fifty years this royal pair
had lived together in affection. The,
scene would "have been one of interest in i
any class of life. May it not be noticed ,
on a throne ? j
Tea was handed.. The Queen contin- j
ucd to stand or move about the rooms. In
one was a table of refreshments. I went;
to it with Major General Sir Henry Torrens,
an officer distinguished by service
and wonnds, whose acquaintance I had !
made at Lord Rathurst's. He was one '
of the establishment of the DukeofYork. I
On the table were urns and tea-kettles of;
fretted gold. Sir Henry recommended |
me to a glass of what I supposed w ine, in j
a flagon near me ; but he called it king's
cupt given only at royal weddings.
Returning to the chief rooms, the Prin- j
cess Sophia Matila pointed out to Mrs. j
Rush and myself, the paintings ; also the
representation of a bird from India formed
of precious stones so as to resemble beau- j
tiful plumage, with other objects of curiosity
or taste in the palace. She did
more?she spoke of Washington. She
paid a spontaneous tribute to his virtues, j
Xone but Americans can know this would
fall upon the heart! To hear his immortal
name pronounced with praise in a palage
of George III., and bv a princess of
his family, had a high and touching value.
Mentioning this princess I add, that my- j
self and family afterwards experienced l
her obliging civilities in ways the remem- i
uUiiVlt i? rrhp.rishod with irrate-I
V vr* " ,MV" *w " D

At ten, the company came awav; not
however without receiving, each one, 1
believe, a piece of the wedding cake.
TIIE GREAT MISSOURI AN.
The following extract of a letter is from j
a gentleman formerly of this city, now
on a tour through the Western States,
and at present in St. Louis, from whence
he writes;
"I went the other night to look at the
greatest curiosity that I have ever seen,
ft is called the great Mis&ourian., and is
the skeleton of the greatest animal ever
known. It was found about 200 miles
west of this plac-f?, in this .State, by a German.
It measures to the top of the ribs
16 feet high, is 32 feet long, has two tusks i
that are from 10 to 12 inches in diameter,
and are 16 feet apart. The head and
tUoks weigh 1100 pounds. The joints of
the knee in the fore legs are inverted, so
that he fiends his knee the contrary way
from any other animal. He appears to
have been web-footed, has no hoof--, hut
toes about 8 or 10 inches long. The
owner has computed its size, in comparison
to the size of an ox here that weighs
i 1000 pounds, and he is just 100 times
larger than the ox, so that he must have
weighed when alive, 100,000 pounds,
j (50 tons.) I should think he would nave
required live or six buffaloes for breakfast.
I The six musicians, who play nt the exhibition
of the animal, sit up in his ribs.
"The owner has been offered 820,000
cash for him. He leaves in a few days
for New Orleans from thence to
New York, thence to Europe. It is
worth a good fortune for any six men,
but the owucr will not sell it."
Troy Whig.
The following notice of American artists
abroad, is from a letter to the editors
of tee Now York Signal:?
" At Florence I saw Greenougli's great
work, the statute of Washington. The
design to strikingly grand and appropriale,
both Republican and Christian.
Washington is represented seated in his
chair, with one hand resigning his sheathod
suord, whilst with his right he points
to heaven in acknowledgement of that
Providence who had given him the v ctorv.
The figure is just eight times the size of
life, On one corner of the pedestal stands,
j in a graceful attitude, a small statue of
Columbus, and on its opposite another of
an American Indian a noble specimen of
the aborigines of our country. There
are also two has relief, one representing
Phoebus in the chariot, and the other
f Hercules strangling the serpent in the
cradle. Mr. Grecnouah will embark with
his monument at Leghorn, on board the
United States line of battle ship Ohio, early
in March next. While at Florence I
