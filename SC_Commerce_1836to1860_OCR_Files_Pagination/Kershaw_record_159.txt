W together, therefore, 1 ask you to listen t?? t
^ my talk. Do not let my words enter in j
; one ear and pass through the other like
tho listless winds, but receive them firmly
into your hearts, because them emanate
* from the purest feelings of my own heart
for your welfare.
^ . - f^rolheTs, listen! I have heard of the
gloom which overspreads your land, of
the * loud mutterings of the hig gun, and
, the shrill echo of the war whoop. ??f the
hostile blow which has been struck .between
y.?u and ??ur vhite brethren! Tl is
is bad news, and it makes me feel sorry.
Perhaps you have heard that the Cherokee*
are also in trouble about their own
lands; this is truv. but I have snoken to
iny people ai d they have liste ed. I
them to remember rite language of President
Washington and his illustrious successors,
and to hold last to the faith of
treaties, which, by mutual consent, have
b? en solemnly pledged between our IMation
and the Uut ed States, that the laws (
and treat es lor the security and protec- ,
tion of our rights were the only weapons
with which we must defend them, tl.at if it
has been our misfortunes to sufT? r wrongs
from the hands of our while brethren
we should not despair of having justice
Still extended to us by the Uniwd States.
Brothers, i am now in the beloved City
where our Fath? r, the President of the
United States, is scaled, and his great
Councils are held. 1 have with u.e a
delegation of chosen men, sent hy the
council of my Mali >n, for the purpose of
endeavoring to settle all our differences

and friendly terms.
Since our arrival here we have mei
with delegations of red men from severs!
of the Northern tribes. Ametng them we
have seen Black llawk, of whom yon
may have heard something, they have a I
come on a peaceable mission to the Ciovernment
of the United Slates in relation
to the alfairs of their respective Nations.
Brothers, I have now shaken the hands
of cur elder brother, the Secretary <?I
War, und of our father, the President ol
the United State's, and talked with them.
I told e>ur elder brother, that it grieve.,
my heart to hear of the shedding e?f blootl
between our white and reel brethre ti, the
ftemiuedes, ami askeel him if it cemle! not
be sletpped and he aled by the: halm ??f
peace; he promptly ?epli? d yes, ami said
that he had no desire to she?l the hlood of
the red men, as it was the wish of his
heart to treat them ail with kindness,
and liberal justice, ami assmed me that
su? h were the reelings of the President
towards them, but that the Government
could not take any steps in your alVuirs
who h may be interpreted into an art of
weakness. Yet if your people desired
peace, and would lay away your warlike
attitude, and come in, that n in ?iy of
peace would v^>e.negotiated with \ on, tin-1
, der the autlHiity of the President .if the.
United States, and that a veil shall he
thrown over every thing that has taken |
a place during ihe war. so that they may be
r covered and never remembered or revenged.
That you, Oceola Powell, and all
others, who ma) have been considered as
principal actors in the conflict, shall be
received into ?qual favor and protection,
With all the Meminoles in the treaty of
Peace.
Brothers, I have truly related to vou,

wnai ikib ufrn said to mo hy our elder j
brother, who represents our father the]
President of the United States, in relation
to your Nation. I believe his words have
been uttered with a sine* re heart. 1
have, therefore, proffered to heroine medin
tor for the restoration <<f peace and j
friendship between you and our white,
brethren, and I rejoice in lell'ng yrtu tlmf
it has been accepted. Brothers, I have]
sent a letter to my associate Chiefs at
, home, to inform them of all this. 1 have
directed them to send four of my trustworthy
and confidential men* with an
interpreter, to go a* messengers of peace,
' and forthwith bear you thi? talk. I trust
you will take tliern by the hand andl

Save never been stained with your blood

For the sake of your women and*chtlilren

1 tell you in the language of truth, that
1 have no other interest in this raediwtkm
than tl>? common good which the blessings
of peace bestow on all mankind.
1 do n<?l stop to inquire u ho has been
in fault, nor to throw blame upon 3*011 or
our white brethren for what has taken
place. It is enough for rae to hear that
our white brethern say that they do not
desire your destruction, and that they are
willing to negociat* peace and friendship
with y ui, and to forget all the evils which
have transpired between you and them,
that you may hereafter hold each other
nure firmly by the hand of brotherly
love.
Brothers, I will not speak of the great
power of the United States' Government
because ton know all about it as well as I
do, nor will I say any thing to operate
upon your fears, for I know that a brave
people, wren driven to a Mate ot desperation,
would sooner die undt r the strong
arm of power, than to shrink and die the
death of the coward.
But I will speak to you with the voice
of n friend, and with the voire of reason
advise you as a small hut ?? hrave people,
to act the part efa noble rare, and at once
to throw yourselves upon the magnanimity J
and justice of the American people, for 1
will again repeat that our elder brother, |
the Secretary of AVar, says that the Gene-I
ral Government ardently desires to termi-'
nato this contest without the further cflu-j
sion of blood, ami that it would be gratifying
lo all who are animated with kind j
feeli gs to war s their red brethren, to see j
you return to the paths of peace. That'
if yon desire peace, it will be grunted you,'
and that every ki ducss and indulgence in
the power of the Government will be exercised
towards you. Brothers! listen.
Can you turn a deaf ear to such kind feelings
and generous sentirm nts and will
you prefer war to peace, and the utter ruin
of your people to their welfare ami
happiness? 1 cannot and will not believe
it. As to the terms upon which your
treaty of peace shall he negnriulcd, I have
nothing to say?that is a matter to be
agreed upon b? twecn you and the Government
of the United States. 1 have been
assured however, by the Secretary of War,
that you shall be liberally compensated j
for any losses or injuries you may have
sustained by the injustice of y.mr white
brethren, and further, that after peace
.md friendship shall have been restored,
should you desire to send u delegation to
pay a visit to your father, the President
of the United States, for the purpose of
gelling any business confirmed, which
may he agreed upon between you and his
commissioners, thai y<?u shall I e permitted
10 do so in company with his agent, .and
those of your Cherokee brethren,-who
vill deliver y? u tlvis talk.
Brothers! my talk is over, I now comi
end to your friendly reception, the messengers
of pence, who in ntv name, will
offer you the right hand of friemlship and
the pipe of peace, which 1 trust, will be
accepted ami smoked with them and our

Indian Cruelties.?Ross Cox in liis
adventures oil the Columbia River gives
llie following description of the tortures
inllicted on one of the BlackI'eet tribe of
Indians, by the Flutbeads, by whom he
was made a prisoner :
" Havi g heen informed that they were
about putting one of their prisoners t
death, I went to tnfcir eamp to witness the
spectacle. The man was tied to a tree;
after which they heated an old barrel of a
m
gun until it became red hot, with which
thv^- burned him ow-the lege, thighs, neck, cheeks
and belly. They then commenced
cutting the flesh fr?n? about the nails,
which they pulled out, and nefct separated
the fingers from the hand joint by joint.
During the performance of these cruelties
the wretched captive never winced, and
instead of suing for mercy, he added fresh
stimulants to their barbarous ingenuity by
the most irritating reproaches, part ofl
which our interpreter translated as follows:
?" My heart is strong. You 4o not
hurt me. You can't hurt me. You are
fools. You dot *t know hnwyto torture.
Try it again. I don't feel any pain yet.
We torture your relations a great deal
better, because we make the in ciy out loud
like little children. You are not brave :
you have small hearts, and you are always
afraid to fight." Then addressing one in
particular, be said, It was by my arrow
you lost your eye;" upon which the Flathead
daried at him, and with a knife in a
! moment scooped out one of his eyes; at
the same lime cutting the bridge of his
nose nearly in two This did not. stop
him; ?ith the remaining eye lie looked
sternly at another, anil said, 411 killed
your brother, and scalped your old fool of
a father.'*
The warrior to whom this was addressed,
instantly sprang at Mm, and separated
(lie s?ralp from his head, lie was then
ahout plunging ? knife in his heart, until
die was tohl by the chief to desist. The
raw skull, hicody socket and mutilated |
nose, now presented a horrific appearance,
hat by no tmans rhan>><d his tone of de-,
fiance. 41 It was I," said lie to the chief,'
44 that made vour wife a prisoner lost fall
we put out her eyes; we tore out her
tongue; we treated her like a dog. Forty
of our young warriors"?The chieltain
, became incensed the moment his wife's
name was mentioned ; he seized his gun,
and before tfie last sentence was ended,.
a hall from it passed through the brave I
fellow's heart, and terminated his fright;
ful suffering*. Shocking, however, as this
| dreadful exhibition was, it was far exceeded
by the atrocious cruelties practiced on
the f inale prisoners; in which I am sor- j
ry to siiv, the Flathead women assisted.
with more savage Airy than the men. 11
only witnessed part of what one wretched
young woman suffered, a detail of which
would ho too revolting for publicity. We
remonstrated against the exercise of such
horrible cruellies. They replied by saying
the B ackfeet treated their relations
in the same manner; that it was the
course adopted I>v all red warriors: and
that they could not think of giving up the i <
gratification of (heir revenge in 'he fool-j ,
ish and womanish feelings of the while
men." ,

Oil Monday night last. Brig. Gen. Hernandez,
with his force, returned from uno
ther successful expedition to Spring Garden,
which resulted iti the capture of fifty
thiee Indians, and the re-capture of sixteen
negro slaves. Twenty of these are
warriors, among whom are the eldest and
youngest sons of King IMiilip. We have
procured a copy of Gen. Hernandez's oiler
announcing the success to the troi-psl
of his command, which has been promul-|
gated at all the posts east of St. Johns, t
New Series. 1

1. Brig. Gen. Hernandez, announces
to the troops of his division, the success
of tho recent expedition to Spring
Garden, commanded by himself, undei
the orders of Major General Jesep, which
has resulted in the capture of fifty three
Indians, and in the rescue of sixteen negro
slaves, the property of our citizens;
making a total of sixty-nine Indians and
negroes, of whoin twenty-two arc Indian
Warriors.
The General returns his thanks to Major
Ashby and Capt. Hanson, and to the
officers ami men of the several companies
of their respective commands who composed
the troops of this expedition, as
well as to Assistant Surgeon, Forry, fur
their good conduct throughout the whole
of it.
The General feels himself called on in
on especial manner to notice the bravery
of private Joseph Sanchez, of Capt. Hanson's
company of East Florida Volun
icers, wno, in Advance of the I ndian guides
pursued the two Indian warriors, the
youngest and eldest sons of King Philip,
into the swamp to * hich they had fled;
nnd there captured them, though repeatedly
threatened with the discharge of their
rifles. This conduct the (icneral considers
worthy of the highest piaise.
Part 2. The (icneral takes this opportunity
of ad vet ting to the propriety of
officers impressing on their men the necessity
of their being provided with the
full quantity of subsistence and forage
which may at any time be ordered to be
furmsiied to them, particularly when un- (
der marching orders ; and also of observing
the most perfect silence when in pursuit
of the enemy. To some failure in
b oh tin sc respects during the recent expedition,
may, perhaps, be attributed a
1- ss complete success than would otherwise
have resulted from it. To the officers
belongs the duty of causing the in- <
tcrest of the service to be attended to in
these particulars.
Part 3. Officers in command of the sev- a
cral posts and detachments will cause these c
orders to be promulgated on parhde. By v
order, I

The continued success of Gen. Hernandez,
and the troops under his command, i
nre highly cheering, and creditable to l
himself. May like success attend him in n
all his future operations. n
The good conduct of the Indian guides h

serving of high reward ; for to thein is i
due the merit of the capture of these In- t
dinns without bloodshed. f

The New York letters of the lGtli ult.

the first indications of an amelioraion
of the a flairs of trade, in the United

:>f steady and regular communications between
the countries, for the purpose ol
commerce, as they have heretofore existed.
They assist, at the same time, in
clearing up the mystery which has been
thrown over the course pursued by the
Hank of England in the restoration of
this intercourse, and in which, as it now
.1 ? ...
,ni no win, nirj ure iu mise uic principal
?art. Ii appears tl>at Capt. Stockton, oi'
he United Si?i? s, who lias acquired some
lotwrirty of lute, by the advice he has
liven to the directors, was enabled during
lis recent visit to England, to raise a
oan of two hundred tlnd seventy thouand
pounds for the Camden and Amboy
vail Road Company, of which he tlcposicd
80,0001. in the Rank of England prc'ious
to his departure. Against this
11 in. that institution have issued bills on
England in triplicate, of which the firsts
lave been deposited in the Rank, and the
econds and third* taken to New York,
o be sold to those merchants who may
equirc a remittance to this country, of
inquestionahle security, which, according
o the prevalent belief there, in conse
_ / . ?* - - ?
[urnce in rcreni events was 1101 10 L?e
bund. - This distrust was the great obstaIc
to renewed, commercial intercourse on
, large scale, and has led to the clumsy
xpedient of transmitting specie backward
and forward, to which the merchants
lave been driven for some time past, unlet
which, commerce can never go on
ipon ? large scale.
Though the sum in itself seems small,
i is supposed that it will yet do much in
he restoration of confidence, and it is
uiderstood to be arranged that the whole
T the subscription of 229,0001, made
ore for the Camden and Amboy Kail
load, will be paid as it becomes due,
nto the Bank of England, and applied to
he same purpose. Another mode of supdying

trisen out of the disturbed state of the
