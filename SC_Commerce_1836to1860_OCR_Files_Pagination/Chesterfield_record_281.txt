of acres. If to the quantity unsold lying
within the limits of the S ates, the amount
in the territories and regions beyond be nd.

statement of the Commissioners of the Genoral

The reader who may be interested in the advertisement
headed Real Estate for sale, will see
an addition to it this week.
The Letters on Education which we com.
tnence copying this week on the fourth page,
will, we think be read with interest and pro.it by j
all parents, The author was a signer of the
Declaration of Independence, and President of
Princeton College. Ho was a man of c'osc ob.
soavation, of intimate acquaintance with human
nature, and remarkably sound judgment.
Sax.b of Morcs Mlxticaltjs.?The Baltimore
American states that a gentleman of that city
last week sold a flourishing crop of Moras Muhicaulis
growing on a fluid of fifteen acres for
thirty two thousand fixe hundred dollars. Pretty
substantial evidence this that the silk culture is
going ahead.
The election of members to Congress takes
place in North Carolina noxt week, except a
few counties in which it took place this week.?
The elections in Tennessee, Alabama, Kentucky,
and Indiana also take place about this time.
The Chinch Bug.?We understand thai large
numbers of thiw destructive insect have appear,
ed in some cornfields in our neighborhood, and
have done much injury to late corn. In some
places a few were seen last year; there they
are now much more numerous. Should they
continue to increase in number, and spread, as
there is cause to apprehend, thoy may utterly
destroy entire crops of corn, oats, and wheat,
over an indefinite extent of country, and for a
succession of years; it is theiefore of immense
importance te discover some means of prevent,
ing their ravages. What would be the effect of
applying to the corn preparations from substan.
ces known to be offensive to most insects, such
4s sulphur, elder (Sambucus nigra,) China or
Pride cf India troe (Mtlia Azeterach,) Jimson or
Jamestown weed (Datura stramonium,) or to.
b&cco? Any of these could be easily obtained
in this neighborhood in sufficient quantity to
make the experiment, by those who have the
bug.
The application of the sulphur would bo
somewhat costly; but if it should save the crop of
corn and fodder, this would be more than compensation
for the labor and expense. T he sublima nlnhnr.
commonly called flowers of sulphur |
is the only form in which it is sufficiently fiuo.
The best mode of applying it would perhaps be
to mix a small quantity with water, and keep it
constantly shaken or 6tirrod, whilst using, to prevent
its settliag. A decoction from the leaves of
th'o trees and Weeds mentioned might be sprinb.
led on the corn with some such instrument as a
watering pot. The labor would be less than
that of a single plowing ; and all the articles
named might be raised at littlo cost except the
tobacco. We should be glad to see experiments
made with each of thera, immediately, and the
result publis. ed ; that, if any of them should i
prove successful, steps might be taken by the
planters to have a supply of the preventive ,
agent next season. Who can tell but elder
berries, china berries, jimson seed or tobacco :
seed may be in as great demand next spring as
morns multicaulis buds.
To the tobacco and jimson weed it might be
an objection that any part of the juice remaining
on the fodder would rendor it offensive to cattle
and horses.
CUBE FOR A SNAKE-BITE.
An occurrence happened one day last week
a few miles from this place that ought to be
generally ki own.
John rressnal), Jnr. a farmer on Little River
in this County, was severely bitten by a Pilot
Snake in his harvest heir*. After 6tnking the
snake with his sythe and cuttirg it in iwo,
he made his way to his house as speedily as
possible, and sent off to a near neighbor for
some brandy, having heard that it was good
for a snake bite; and there was no physician
nearer than Ashboro*. Not knowing what to
do, and being in great pain, the sufferer casually
laid hold of a bottle of camphor?about
half full, ^camphorated spirits?probably brandy,)
and placing the mouth of the bottle to
tne wound, (the ancle we believe,) he felt partial
relief instantly. All present thought they
Could plainly see the poisonous fluid escaping
from the wound into the bottle. By continuing
this process an hour or two, he become entirely
relieved, and went back to his work
again without further inconvenience. The
above facts were related to us by Mr. Micheal
Luther, a neighbor of Mr. Pressnall, and a
man of undoubted veracity.
The above we take from the Southern
Citizen, published in Ashboro, N. C. The
escape of the poisonous fluid from the wound
into the bottle existed only in the imagiaation
of the bystanders. A knowledge of the modus
operandi of the remedy, however, is of but little
_!.L _ t 1-.1?
importance compared wiuj a ruow ivugv ui na
effect.
We have repeatedly stated and again repeat
that aqua ammonia is a certain remedy for the
bite of a 6aake, as we know both irom our
own experience and that of others. It may
fce obtained at the apothecaries' stores, but
should be used fresh, and out of bottles which
have not often been opened. The dose
far an adult is a teaspoonfu), in a little water,
to be repeated every hour in cases not very
urgent. In urgent cases it may be repeated
every fif.een minutes. It commonly, we
think we might say invariably, affords perfect
relief in from two to four houts. A cloth wet
wi h the undiluted fluid should be applied
to the wound.
From the speedy relief which we have seen
the chloride of lime afford when applied after
the eting of infects, we should be dispcsed'to
apply it after the bite of a snake. It might be
mixed with water and a cbi.h wet with it be
applied to the wound.

MAMMOTH BEET.
Ourrospected friend, David Ewart, Esq., of
tl is place, presented us the other day with an
exceedingly fine Beet, grown in his luxuriant
and beautiful garden. It measures 17 inches
round, and 15 inches long, and weighs five lbs.
aad s withal of a rich and beautiful color.
The above we cut from the South Carolinian,
published in Columbia. If the Editor would
procure from Mr. Ewart, andpublifh a statement
of the k nd of soil in which the beet was grown'
with the kin ; and quantity of manure applied,

8AOO BREAD. |
Sago, which is a vegetable production of
China, gathered by the natives and taken in
junk6 or boats to Singapore, w here it is made I
into a shape fit for shipment, i9 beginning to 1
be used by the bakers of London andEdinburg I
as an ingredient of bread. The article has ;
been long known to medical gentlemen as pos- sessing
nutricious qualities, and has in many '
instances been prescribed in cases of inLgee- ,
tion Of the bread which is made of it, Dr.
Andrew Combe, of Edinburgh, states that it '
is as light, digestible, and palatable as any I
bread he ever tasted, and entirely free from I
the least tendency to sourness, even at the end |
of four days of mild weather, which would not ,
have been the case with the ordinary bread at ,
the end of forty-eight hours." He also observes
"it being easy of digestion in the stomach,
~ ?:n n
atloros a presumpuuu mai. it wm uc wcu
suited to the bowels also." It appears the
bread in question is composed of three fourths
of wheat flour and one fourth of flne sago,
which enables the baker to make a much bet- '
ter loaf at a cheaper rate. The person wr o (
first introduced it, after its quality had bori '
the test of public opinion, had upwards of five '
thousand applications in one day, and the 1
Edinburgh papers are now filled with advertisements
of "Sago Bread," "Sago Rolls" and
"Sago Buns "
An incident?Caution to the Labies.
?A few days 6ince a young lady with her attendant
beau, was promenading and viewing
one of the U. S. establishments, in this vicinity,
when the fair lady, with truly feminine timidity,
became suddenly alarmed by a number
of large wharf rats crossing her path?and in
her fright she fancied that one of the hideous
creatures had taken refuge on her lovely person,
bene& vh her dress, which she fortunately succeeded
in seizing and held fast in her hand.?
Not daring to quit her hold and almost fainting
through alarm, she explained her awkward
predicament to her companion, when they
sought entrance into a neighboring house
where the lady was kindly received, and
shown into a private room, to remove his
rat-ship from beneath the folds of her garments,
when, hands off! lo and behold, what
impudent animal dropt to the floor ? Not an
enormous rat, but the lady's bustle?which
had unexpectedly removed from its destination,
and caused all the false alarm? It is needless
to add that the fair one's difficulties were
speedily adjusted, and she soon recovered from
her fright. [Boston Mer. Jour.
When we read the above, we were somewhat
puzzled to know what the said Bustle
wa6, and as some of our readers may be as
little versed in the mysteries of a hdy'e toilet
in modem times, we will give them the result
of our cogitations on the subject. We suppose
a Bustle to be a certain machine, worn "a tor.
go" by those lovely bipeds, which gives them
that delightfully hump-back'd appearance (a la
mode Dromedary.) eo fascinating to the beaux.
To a superficial thinker this may seem a
strange fancy in the ladies (for our grand mothers,
poor, ignorant souls, grew up as straight
as poplars) but it evinces a thorough acquaintance
with Philosophy. It is a principle loDg
since acknowledged, that "Beauty consists in
curved lines," and if a lady is so unfortunate
as to have a straight spine, she must, put on a
Bustle or fail in possessing the curved line of
Beauty. How delightful to see the antiquated
abstractions of the schools thus practically
applied to the improvement of female beauty.
Had Philosophy been earlier introduced into
our Female Seminaries, our dear, departed
grand.mothers might have seen the matter in
its true light, and have had Bustles too, and
have been as crooked as Black-jacks.

we therefore do not know who is entitled
to credit for the latter part of it.]

wortn of straw berries being raised from one

being less than one twenty fourth of an acre,
a neighbors of ours raised the last season
120 quarts of strawberries, which at 25
cents the quart, the Boston price, would
have produced 30 dollars, equal to 720 dol.
lars per 5cre! Twent>-six quarts were
taken at one picking, so large and fine that
they would have sold quickly at fifty cents

Extract of a Letter from the Editor, dated
Augusta (Geo.) July 23, 1839.
When the great public works which are in
progress in this State shad be completed, they
will furnish facilities of intercommunication
far greater than could have been conceived
by the most visionary mind a few years ago.
Even now, to those who can compare the pres.
ent with the past, the improvement in this respect
is surprising. It seems like a dream that
one can now go from Charleston to Savannah
in less than nine hours, and from thence to
MiJedgeville?a distance of about 169 miles in
26 hours. Eighty miles of the Central Rail
Road from Savannah towards Macon are completed,
which the cars run over in about five
hour*. The road is excellent, and the cars
are better constructed for the comfort of the
passengers than any we have seen. Many of
the Counties far in the interior are already
availing themselves of the facilities which it
affords of thus far transporting their mcrchan.
dize. From Milledgeville to Augusta viatht
Georgia Rail Road at Warrenton?a distance
of near a hundred miles,"is travelled overprincipally
the night in about 14 hours. When
these Roads shall be completed to the great
Trunk they will link closely together the ex*
tremities of the State by bringing them within
a dfy's journey of each other. Aud with the
branches in contemplat'on and in progress,
and oy the junction of other Jroadsjia other
States, the traveller via Charleston or Savannah,
may pursue his way with all desirable
rapidity, and the farmer may find a market
for his surplus productions with comparative
little loss of time or expense. We are gratified
to see that Georgia i6 availing herself of
the natnral advantages which she possesses in
her navigable rivers, and rendering them of
still greater utility by these works of internal
improvement.

) NOTES XXCHANGEb BY TIIE FRENCH AND RUSSIAN
CABINET8.
Note of the French Charged <tAffairs at St. I
Peter sburgh.
The undersigned, Charged d'Affairs of His
Majesty the King of the French, is instructed
to express to the Cabinet of St. Petersburgh
the profound affliction which the French Gov.
ernment has experienced on learning the conclusion
of the treaty of the 8th of July last between
His Majesty the Emperor of Russia and
the Grand Signor. In the opinion of the King's
Government, that treaty imparts to the mutual
relations of the Ottoman empire and of
Russia a new character, against which all tho
Powers of Europe have a right to pronounce
themselves.
The undersigned is therefore instructed to
declare, that if the stirulationaofthat act were
hereafter to bring on an armed intervention of
Russia in the internal affairs of Turkey, the
French Goverment would hold itself wholly at
liberty to adopt such line of conduct as circumstances
might suggest, acting from that moment
as if the sa:dtreaty ex:eted net. The
undersigned if also desired to inform the Ira*'
perial Cabinet that a similar declaration has <
been delivered to the Ottoman Porte by Hif i
Majesty'6 Ambassador at Constantinople, t
I. DE LAORENE. f
REPLY TO THE RUSSIAN MINISTER OF FOREIGN
AFFAIRS.
The undersigned has received the note by
which M. I. de Lagrene, Charge de Affairs of
his majesty the King of the French, has com
municated the deep regret which the conclusion
of the treaty of the 8th of July between
Russia and the Porte has caused the French
Government, without stating at the same time ]
either the motives of that regret or the nature ,
of the objections to which that treaty may give j
rise. The undersigned cannot be acquainted j
with them?still less can he understand them. (
The treaty of the 8th of July is purely* defen- (
sive; it has been concluded between two in- (
dependent powers, exercising the plenitude ot l
their rights, and it does no prejudice to the 1
interests of any state whatever. 1
What could, therefore; be the objections <
which other Powers might deem themselves justified
in racing against such a transaction ! *
How, above all, could they declare that they *
consider it of no validity, unless they have in 1
view the subversion of an empire which the J
treaty is destined to preserve] But such cannot
be the design of the French Government.
It would be at open variance with all the de- ,
clarations it made in the last complications
in the East. The undersigned must, there- ^
fore, suppose that the opinion expressed in M. .
de Lagrene's note rests upon incorrect data, ]
and that, better informed by the communica- .
tion of the treaty which the Porte has recently <
made known to the French Ambassador at (
Constantinople, his Government will better appreciate
the value and usefulness of a trans
action concluded in a spirit as pacific as con- I
servative.
That act changps, indeed, the nature of the |
a -1 . e f
re ations between itussia ana me rone; ior,
to a long enmity, it makes relations of intima- s
cv and confidence succ ?i?d, wherein the ^
1 urkish Government will henceforth find a ?
guarantee of stability, and, if need be, means k
of defence calculated to insure its preserva- "
tion. ^
It is in this conviction, and guided by the ~
purest and most disinterested intentions, that ^
His Majesty the Emp ror is resolved on faith- i
fullv fulfilling should the occasion present it- .
self, the obligations which the treaty of the 1
6th of July imposes upon him, acting thus as <
