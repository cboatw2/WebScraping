a process^of this sort, employing hundreds
of m9ltooa of credit, rn the shape of bank

Iatereet anmially accruing rn favor, of :he
banks was enormous, while the property
upon which the money was expended was
actually producing nothing.
. Influences of this powerful character,
communicated to the great body of the citizens
of our country, could not fuil to be felt
in the Legislatures of the States of the Un
ioo. They felt the impulsion, and acrea
under it.". Large loans were proposed and
it soon appeared that the increase of banks
ami other demands, had nbs rbed so much
of the Americangcapifal as to enable thero to
find a ready or a cheap market in our own
.. country. The markets of Europe were
naturally sought^ as not the Federal Government,
and not the Governments of the
States alone, but local corporations in our
commercial cities, had tbef? found such a
market for large loans upon the.r credit, t
For a lime the State stocks of all desCrip'tiona

eaaea or over tasked credit, the supply became
more than equal to the demind, and
the market fell. The consequence was
electric throughout our countjy, and the
depressions we how feel in commercial
transactions in every branch of trade in the
prices of property, in our demesne industry,
in the wages of labor, flow from these ex.
cessiee uses of credit at home, and these
attempts to overstock the foreign markets
with our credits abroad. .
We are aware that these are plain sug.
gestions; but can we be mistaken in placing
them before our constituents, and asking
thrir awakened attention to them, when we
see the mere tankers of London publishing
to the American puolic a proposition that
tne Uoked States shall bocome endorsers
(bribe individual States, a smvty for their
engagements, as a condition not simply to
(heir obtaining farther loans, bat to the favorable
sale in the British markets, of their
stocks and bonds, now resting there in

Such a proposition as seems to us, should
startle the whole American people. It is a
bold attempt upon the part of* foreign tank,

States again to assume u fearful amount
of debt, or to punish the States of die Union

The univtHPil suspension of the banks, io
May, 1837, met Mr. Van Bnren at the
threshold of hit administration; and from
that moment to this he has been laboring
assiduously to lay the foundation for a
more stable basis for currency and bust
nets; a foundation equal and just to all, and
resting upon tho Constitution of the couatiy.
It has not been the object of his policy, as
k falsely alleged, to destroy credit, but to
wake credit safe and dependable; not to
.overthrow the banking ins buttons o(
v the country, but to separate them from ih?
management of the public revenues; not
Overthrow the hanking institutions of the
ooantry, but to seperare them from tlse man;

cripple commerce, but to give commerce a
standard of currency, so far as the action
of the Federal Government can do it, which
shall not distnrb it by expansions and con.
traction dictated by private interos:s and
monopolizing efforts; riot to suspend trade.

1 IRISH POTATOES.
TO THE EDITOR.
% Dear Doctor:?I send you herewith,
,f another parcel of Potatoes, which I think
" you will pronounce larger than those
^ which you noticed in your last paper.?
j The preparation of the ground, and the
5 mode of culture, were perfectly simple;
' but in one respect, entirely subversive
of a theory sometimes advanced, that
. ground can be made too rich for Potatoes!
. It may be so, but no such doctrine has
" proved sound, in my experience, when I
^ have put it to a practical test, in the culture
of any thing thai I have ever tried.
The land on which these potatoes were
raised, is a spot of ground which has
j been used as a cow-pen for a number of
it years. Last winter I fattened, a good
), many hogs on it, and in January slgnghv
tered upon it 200, or more. It alsofc$s
" received, for years," the greasy water
^ from the kitchen, soap suds, &c. In fine,
It I think it as rich as it can be made. The
* last of February it was broken up, two
3 ways, to the depth offourteen inches, with
lt a plough; tlied laid off in rows, three
> feet at d a half apart, the plough making
* the furrow about eight inches deep. The
potatoes were cut and' dropped in the
'' row, about twelve inches apart, and co.
P** t
I, vered with the plough, about level with
d the surface of the ground. Tliey came
v up handsomely. 1 had them worked well
u with the hoe, leaving the ground about
n level. The next working, was with a
e daggon [dough, and hoe, elevating a bed
y about six inches above the surface. A
^ short time after, when about half grown,
* 1 had all the vines topped, as some farmK
ers do their cotton.
I. Yours most truly,
<M AUG'S. P. LACOSTE.

Southern Chronicle;?We have
received the first number of a paper with
thi9 title issued by Messrs. *S. Whir &
,H. Raiford in Columbia. It is of large
size, neatly printed on good paper, and
strenuously advocates Gen. Harrison as
a candidate for the Presidency. Mr.
Weir is already favorably known to the
public as Editor and publisher'"of the
Times and Gazette, the predecessor of the
South Carolinian.
We are indebted to Messrs- Calhoun,
Campbell and Sumter for various public
documents. One of those from Mr.
Calhoun is the report of the committee
to whom had been .refered the bill to
cede, or rather sell to the new states the
public lands within their respective
limits. The substance of this report we
shall present to our readers as soon as
we can make room for it.
North Eastern Boundary.-?The
President sent to the Senate a message
Oil the 29th June, containing a letter
/hom the-British Minister to the Secretary
of Statp, with the answer to it, on the
subject oF the North Eastern Boundary.
The British Government have accepted
the offer of the President to appoint a
joint commission for surveying the line,
with the conditions that all points on
which "the commissioners cannot agree
are to be referred to a friendly power for
arbitriment; and that the decision of such
power is to be final and conclusive.?
This, of course, must lead to an adjustment
of the question.
Gen. Harrison's opinion in regard to
8lavery.
So much evidence has already been given
to the public on this subject ihat more
would seem superfluous. Somo persons
however profess still to douht; we therefore
copy from the Raleigh Register the follow,
ing extract of a Ietto?- from a nephew of the
General's to Geo; E. Badger, of Raleigh.
The position of Gen. Harrison before
the public is now such as to render
his-opinions an object of interest to all
honest Farmers of whatever party.
\ Berkley,
Charles City County, Va. )
June 9th, 1840^ $
' I believe, it has been objected to Gen'l.
Harrison, that his hostility to the Institution
of Slavery, first induced him to leave Vir.
ginia. This is a great mistake?Gen. H.
srhon but a bov, barely 19 years of age, assumed
the profession of arms: not for the1
purpose of exhibiting his fine figure arrayod j
in the splendid uniform of his country,
ei, her in the Drawing Rr*>m or on the pa- j
rade; hut to uns^eath his youthful sword, to
pnril his nohle life in deadly conflict ..with
the wild and ferocious savage of the West,
whose thirst for blood wns not yet glutted
by the slaughter of the Armies of Herman
and St. Clair; nnd disinterested eye. witnesses"
have, said, that tn the noble hearing of
this gallant youth, was mainly owing the
neons* of one wine Af the Army.- Of his
greet Instructor in ibe art. of War. thechi.
yalrnai General Wavne. W. H. Harrison
was sun a soldier in the West when ho mar.
rled Miss Svmmas of that country, and
thus became one of its citizens.
Before his (W. H. H.) "Vnarrisgn, the
Father of Gen. Harrison d;ed leaving 'o his
son William, a small land ! property. The
nnrsonal estate was entirely consumed m
the discharge of his deh's; th#? pnrmv having
twice during the Revolution, been sta.
fionM nt Berkley, tho fimilv nest, which
s'rjnned of every specips of proper'v, in.
chiding "nil the nhKbodied negroes, with
the entire house furniture. This cruel eonduct
on the part of the British, left Gen*
FT'* father in his ol(| ngp. barely enough
to obtain the comforts of life. I thought it
as well to say thus much. Now. Jet us turn
to the charge of Abolition against the Genernl.
On the 29th May. 1821. at the conclusion
of n long familiar letter, he writes,
"I am not at present in nny political appointment
excepting the. honorable ono of
being designated, or. the pnrt of Kentucky,
to settle a dispute with Tennessee about
their common boundary. I was. last fall,
run for the Senato of the United Status,
and nftor a number of balloting* lost it by
a few vofpn; hut I lost no honor bv the conlost."
For this failure, he aligns three reasons.
Af'er mentioning the two firs', he
snvfl?4'buf fhesp consideration* would have
availed nothing, if thirdly. I had not. in op
position to the whole State, adhered to the
vote I had given aguinst the restriction on
Missouri."
In another le'fer of a precisely similar
character with the former, he concludes
thus,?"1 am a candidate for the next Con.
i/ress?I believe there is no doubt of my
election, but I have a warm opposition?
mv vote on dte Missouri question will do me
most injury." This is dated 3lst August,
1822. In a third letter of the 10th Sept.
1835, lie states?"The whole course of my
Congressional career, and my conduct in
every situation in which I have been placed,
affords, I think, ample evidence' that I
could give my sanction to no mcasue calculated
to injure and oppress the section of
the Union in which I was born and educa?
ted?from the People of which my Family
have so often received evidences of the*
highest confidence, and where etdl reside
many ofmyncurest and dearest connec.
nons. The truth is, that in my political
course, I have suffered severely for what
has been called my Sou'liern feeling?, &e.
In relation to the Tariff, ho gays?"that
question must be considered settled." On
the topic of Slavery, he adds?"My Speech
at Viucemies on that ?ubj$Sjj?wu* not dc
v'V . ' - >'j
in
livered for the purpo e~of publishing what
my opioions were; those long since known,
but to counteract the mischievous attempts
of the Emuncipators."
In a letter, as late as the 7th October
1838, ho says, in allusion to the late
Presidential election?-u h was proved that
I had always been tho warm and ardent
supporter of 'he Southern Slates in relation
to their Slnve property?that in opposition
to air the other members of the Defegnlion
from Ohio, as well as Indiana, I voted
against the Missouri restriction, and for
that act, lost my election to Congress. Twoyears
after, I was amongst the first to
come out it^a Speech at Viucennes against
the Abolitionists. These facts are all
known, and not the least ground has been
given to indicate any change of opinion on
my part, &c. , ' \
I am Sir, Very Reaped fully,
BENJ. HARRISON.
P. S. Please recollect the character of
these letters?they are written in on easy.
famil;art confidential style, and were surely
never intended for publication, but on the
inalevoleoce of his enemies, 1 rest my justification
in giving them publicity.

A FACT.
Not many years since, there lived in hi K
city a virtuous nnd respectable mechanic,
lie received an education such as persons
in that station of life generally receive, and
had tlie advantage of religious instructions
from his parents. Ho hud married a young,
and beautiftfl lady, to whom hewasardehdy
attached, and with whom ho promised bimi
so If a life of unalloyed hippineas*
( Time rolled on. He had been blessed
with two children, and had, by indefatigable
irufus'ryv amassed considerable wealth ; bu%
unfortunately, he became acquainted with - some
idle and profligate young men, and in
an evil moment allowed himself to be led ' *'
away from the p iths of virtue, and frequently
accompanie-d them on their M sprees"
and " pleasure excursions," as fhey termed
them. Perhaps he lulh d himself into' a
false jecurity, nnd indulged the delusive-'
hope that, he could at nny lirne forsake tltefr
company. But, alas ! slowly, though sore*
Iy, lhe habit of injemperance grew upon him.
11 He acquired a fondn?ss for liquor, nnrf r<Jeoc*-??
tod to that of a more, stimulating nature, to gratify
the morbid nppeiite produced by ^
excessive indulgence. Ho vis ted grogshops
and taverns, and became in commeti
parlance, a drunken sot." His mental ;
and physical energies were piostrated, his*
weal h was expended, his reputation ruined *
and his family hnnoverisbed ood disgraced.
f l% 1 ' U.. J L*.,n A.smo i-_
His leisure time, wihcii ??u u**-u
ty devoted to the mental cultivation1 of hit
children, and the profitable "society of^hit
wife, was how spent in revelry and debuach- ^
cry.
In vain did hi^ wife remind liirn of the respectable
situation whi?-h he hud formerly
occupied, and of the happiness which they
had enjoy<^d.?In vain did she implore him
. for hie o wn sake, for the sake of herselfand :
her children, to forsake ids d ssolute Com*
panious, and enjoy again that happiness '
which had ho long ceased to smile upon
( them. frequently promised Iter, that h%^.
woukh not drink aivy more, and for some '
flawy they experienced the good result; hut
so strong whh the temptation, and so weak
was poor human nature, (hot.he relapsed
into his bud habits; he r.\ 1T
' Child his phystiiim,
And hugged the foul disease."
By thistimnhe wa9 deeply inrolv?d iq.
debt; and lir.d it not been -fur the money r
which ffis wife earned by her needle-work,
they must have experienced inexpressible
? suffixing. His landlord, to whom he was
? much in arrears, was urgent in htsdemsmis
> for piymeuf, and finding these unavailing,
' he resolved to seize (he furniture. Bis ten.
> ant begged him to grant a lit le longer in>
diligence, avowing his willingness ?od in?
tent ion to reform, to work industrious!/*
> ul unnely, to pnj every bribing he o.weoT^
To this the landlord replied, that he had so
frequently made such promises, and had invariably
broken them, that he couM no long
c'r piece confidence ?n him; but that if'he
' would pledge himself, unconditionally, 1o
i m'gn the temperance pledge,bnthe first op'
ponunity, he would noisiez", his furniture,
and would gram hint whatever time
> he might specify, in which to liquidate the
drbt. He assented, and d/'d sign the pi? Jge?
and fortunate for h m was the day on which r
lie absolved himself from ulh'giance to that
? re mora less despot, that spreads desolation
and ruin wherever he sways his sceptre;
that has brought to a premature grave so &
many men of the most transcendent talents?
44 Men that the roJ of empire might have
ivayedi
Or wuk'd to ecstacy the living lyre."
Suffice it to say that he was a new man.
fie abandoned vicious company, obtained
employment, and worked assiduouslybut
soon aff r determined to leuve the city, nnd
go to some oher place, where he would not
jabor under so many dsudvuntngos from ft
bad reputation, (laving discharged hit
debts, tic rented, on (he Eastern Shore, a ?.
small farm, which he has since purchased,
and on which he lives, though somewhat
iidvftfMted in yeariu.io the fruition of as much
i happiness as any. innm in bimilar circum?
stances.
