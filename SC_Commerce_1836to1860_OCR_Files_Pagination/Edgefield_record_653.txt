Sir-Thinking it may be interesting or
important to you to know of some or the
late operations aend present plans of tie
British Hudson's Bay Company in tho
North Paci6c ocean, I beg leave to pre
sent to your notice same facts in relation to
the same. and whi Wlave come to my
knowledge front personal observation. or
from sources entitledAo the fullest credit.
All thit extensive line of coast compre.
bending the Russian possessioni oi the
northwest coast of America, from Mount
St. Elias south to the latitude of 510 40'
north, (the last being the lioundary-line he
tween the Russian and American territo
ries) together with the sole and ex'!usive
right or privilege of frequenting tll ports.
bays, sounds. rivens, &c.. witnin sail trri
tory. and establishing forts and trading
with the Indians, has been leaqed or 2rant

pay. a-nually. four thousand fur seal sins.
,or the value thereouf in money. at ue ra o
of thirty-two shoillings each-say ?tG,400
sterling, or $30.620.
In the above named lense the Itusinn
have. however, reserved to thenselves the
iilund of Siska, or New Archansel; in
which place. you probably are aware, the
Russians have a large settlement-the de
pot and headquarters of their fur trade witi
Fox islands, Alkutian islands, and the con
tinetatal shore west ward of Mount St. Eli.
as. All the tradin; establishnents of the
Russians lately existing at TummatsSick
Tie. and other places within said territory.
leased to the Hudson's Bay Cotipany.
have of con.equcice been brokenti o.
Thus the 4-4jdson's Bay Compmty, not
content with monopoliziig the heretofore
profitable trade of the Aimcricans, (if sup
plying theRussian settlements on the iort h
west coast. have now completely cut thtim
ol'also from all trado with the most valu
able fur regions in the world.
Whether the arrangements made be
twoen sheRuitsians and English. above
alluded leare confornable ;o the treaties
existing between the United States on the
one part, and those naniiins respectively on
the other. I leave to your bettcr knotsl
edge to determine.
With the doincs of the Hudson's ly
* Company at Pugetb Sound alnd the Co
lumbia river, you are doubtless fully in
formed; those. h-owever, lately commenced
by theat in Califorma will admit of my
saying a few words.
At Sun Francisco they have purchased
* ina i anadan&_etabuhmoent,
and depot for merchandise; and they in
tend this year to have a place of the same
kind at cachi of the principal ports in Up
per California. Two vessels are buildimg
in London. intended for the same trade

I have been informed by 0ne id the
agenta of the Hudson's Bay teampu..y,
that the agricultural and commtuerciatl ope

Columbia river, California. and Saniida

Jiudson's Bay Company. but by n hia: mtay

who are the chi' fimemtberi and~ stockhld~l
ers of said company, amid who have a'so
ciated themselves undter the fimt i leily,
Simpson. & Co-;in Lo.dun, and with a
capital of mnore than$ 15,00,00O0.
Seeing these companie, then, marcha
ing with iron f'intstepi to the possessioni of
.the most valuable portiont of the country it
the Northern Pacific; anid considerintg, too,
the immenie amount of their capital. the
number, enterprise, and energy of their
- agents, and the policy pursued by them,
-- rent reason is there to fear that Astinricant
commerce in that part of world omust 50oon
lower its lag. lint, sir, it is to be hoped
that our Government will soon dto somne
ihing to break up the British settlements in
the Oregon Territory, and thereb5 destroy
the source from which now, emanate mthe
most dire evilsto American interests ia the
Western World. In the endeavor to bring
about that desirable object. you have done
much; and every friend to his country.
every person interested In the commerce
of the Pacific. must feeli grateful for the

TO THE TE ICNEIt O' EDoEFIELD DISTRIer.
Genthmrn.-The great inconvenience. tou
ble and vexation, whirl teaehers in the coun
try. too often experience. from the inability of'
p..teni to preoiure uiatable books for their chil
chemn. call hamdly for a remedv. which I think is
in %on powi er to apply, and which I feel a%r.
ed %, ill meet the cordial approbation of every
pareit tm the i)istrict. who wishes his child pro..
perly aid weli instructed.
A merchaumt at Edgefield C. H . told the wriL
ter of thi article, tf-ut he was ah-ays at a loss
in purchaing school books; for almost every
teacher diff,-rod in his choice; the consequenco
of whichl i-. the merchant is ultimately left to
make his own selection. and not unfrequently
purcmases b mkm which are seldom called for,
and thereby sustaining a loss.
The remedy I would propose, is that the
teachers shomil meet in conveition at die Court
House, and there, after a' free conversation,
unite upon a cite-mce -l books for elementary in
striction to be uismd in die difr-renit %choolp. in
the district. The inerchint would then know
what books to purciase, and the almost certain.
ty -I* their sale. womuld induce min tm be well
supplied. .md the teacher he enabled to keep up
his clusse. witihout diiculty.
The almo'st natral consequence of a misce.
laneous selectoii of school books. is that the
teacher has frequently to make three or four
elaPs s. where t.ere Aiould be but one, therebv,
aihough imcreasing his own labors to a great
e,, tt. actually depriving his students ofa por
tion ot attention that could otherwi-e be be.
otowed. Every teacher in the country has pro.
heably experiencec! something like the follow.
min:-Five or six children enterwho are ed.
vaIcm:d iearly alike, each brings a different
bok, or probably some finime at all. Here is
a I a-t lour times more titme consumed in
teaching these childien thm is necessary.
Another advantage likei to be derived fhom
such a iepmtie,-a. is the recotmmendation af a
iumber of books for fire-side reading, which
would probably induce the nerchants, or some
one. to keep a supoply. his,. at first view, may
appear dictatorial, but when it is known, that
teaciers are frequently appled to by parents.
