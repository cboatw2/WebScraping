IMPROVEMENT OF SANDY SOILS.
In a short jaunt we have recently token
through that paradise of New England,
the Connecticut valley, we have witnessed
a success in the reclaiming of worn
out sandy lands, which we hardly dared
to expect with the ease, economy and
facility with which it has Ween accomplished.
The lion. W. Clark of Northampton,
has keen the great pioneer in
this course, and from the successful results
he has achieved we may fairly class
him among the great agricultural reform
O p C
ers of the present day. He has already
given to the public the theory of his operations,
which we hope to find room to lay
before our readers at some future time.
Our object now is simply to give his practise.
and after our fa'rners have begun
t O
the good vurk of reclaiming their almost
barren wastes, it will be a pleasure for
them to look into the modus operandi,
and see the reason of their success.
There are three essential features in this
practise, and the simultaneous adoption
1 t Kn ilocirori
or eacn is essvuum iu
object. The first is the frequent and
thorough use of the roller; the second a
constant covering of crops on the ground ;
the third is the introduction of clov er and
grass as a fertilizer. To illustrate this,
we give the history of a single field of
some 40 acres of worn out sandy soil, in
the vicinity ofN. This field was purchased
by Mr. C. some eight or ten
years since for nine dollars per acre,
while the fertile bottom lands on the other
side of the town, would sell readily for
$150 to $200. Ilis object was first to
get a crop of corn if possible, and the
land being too poor for this, he carried on
to it a moderate quantity of peat or swamp
muck, which was found in tho low places
on the same field. We may observe in
passing, this peat and muck exists to an
almost unlimited extent throughout Now
England, and we consider it of vastly
<M more intrinsic value to the community
that all the gold mines that have da?,zled
the eyes of our Southern neighbors for
the last fifteen years. With this dressing
say of fifteen to thirty loads to the
acre, the whole cost of which consi. 's in
simply digging and throwing into heaps,
to be drained, and acted on by the atmosphere,
after which it is carried either by
carts or sleds in winter onto the adjacent
ground; the land is then ploughed, and
whatever scurf, sand grass, rushes, mosses,
pusseys and briars there may he on
the land are turned under, and such is
the digeslibUUy* of the soil all these raw
materials are at once converted into humus
or gcine as food for the required
plants. This sandy soil has the stomach
of an ostrich, and if it cannot, as tnat voracious
biped has the credit of doing, digest
old shoes, iron spikes, and junk bottles,
it can dissolve and convert into vegetable
chyle, whatever organised matter
is giver, to it. The effect of this comparatively
slight dressing yielded a first crop
of some thirty bushels of corn to the acre,
enough to pay for the first cost of the land
and the whole expense of producing it.
But while the corn was growing, say irorn
the 20th July to the 10th August, rye
with red and white clover seed was sown,
and the corn being so planted as to admit
of harrowing two ways, or even four if
necessary, it was well got in with the
harrow, and the ground being amply protected
by the corn during the sultry weather
of this season, the new seed took a
vigorous start, and as soon as the corn
was somewhat matured, it was cut and
carried otf the ground, and the new
growth then had the entire possession.
The roller was then thoroughly applied,
os also in the following spring. The
early sowing gives strength to the roots
0 of both rye and clover, and renders hazard
of winter killing cither, especially the elover,
much less. When from any cause
he is prevented from sowing tho clover
early, it is omitted till early in the follow
if)tr spring ; a posiponuilicm liiaiiuuuiu ug
avoided when possible, as it thus loses a
year's time, requiring another season to
mature. The rye is cut the following
summer, when the clover is suffered to re.
main, shedding its seed upon the ground
for a successive crop. The following
season, if in proper condition, it is again
put into corn or rye according to its fertility.
and the course is again renewed.
The land however usually requires an add
11 ion a 1 season in clover, and sometimes

I more, to give the requisite fertility. Mr.
C. showed us a field, which from the
originally poor condition described, without
the addition of any manure or peat or
muck, has produced him five crops insevI
en years, the last, which had but just taki
en off, yielding seventeen bushels to the
| acre. This it will be readily admitted is
1 a large crop for poor land, and much
j beyond the average yield in New Kngland.
The growth of the clover on this
j field, of this spring's sowing, was promisi
ing in the highest degree, and as evenly
set as in the best land, giving every proj
mise of a large crop the next season,
which of course is designed to be added to
the soil for its future improvement. When
) the land is first put into use, (for Mr. C.
has several other similar fields which (
. have been variously treated, though al;
ways on the same principles,) and it is too
1 poor to produce a paying crop of corn
and he has not time to add the muck, he
j turns under the surface vegetation, and
puts on a crop of rye always accompany
, ing this with the clover and after one
year's crop from this last, lie never fails
in a fair yield of corn. On afield thus
treated, without any dressing of muck
he got 27 bushels of corn per acre for the
first crop, and after an interval of another
season, obtained thirty.three bushels on
the same land, showing a decided increase
in the productiveness of the soil.

sustaining policy, has been a prominent
i principle in this system, this is all that
has thus tar been atforded. The muck

rating addition, but thi.s he has not always
the time to give, and at the prices he has
paid for his land, he can afford to leave it
once in two or three years in clover, by
which it is renovated, and for the present
perhaps this may be the most judicious'
plan. As lands become dearer, however, j

management, they being now worth $20

$8 to $12, the policy of manuring will be.
come more expedient, though the rapidly
improving nature of this system will give
greater efficacy to the clover crop as a
fertilizer.
It is surprising to see the elevated noles
and barren planes, that so lately exhibited
J nothing hut a crawling sand, by the operations
of the clover roots, in this otherwise
impracticable material, gradually
changing its inadhesive character to a
O O
firmly connected mass, showing a furrow ,
slice that would gratify the most practised '
eye. Mr. Clark acknowledges his sur- j
prise at the facility with which the clover

of the roller. VYre are inclined to con- !

for his white and other clover he is greatly
indebted to the Plaster. Of this we have
more to say hereafter.
We observed the wcodchucks, who are
arrant epicures and gourmands in their
.-election of esculents, and especially, of
sweet and abundant clover fields, are
thoroughly colonized over all the fields ol
Mr. C. They follow him, as our politicians
do the successful candidate of Exe- j
cutive dispensations for John Randolph's
seven principles, the five loaves and two
fishes. They snuff his green patches
of trefoils, and instanter abandon the
poverty stricken fields of his unthrifty
neighbors. His crop of wood chucks,
I though not as important as the shoe crop
I at Lynn may soon be well worth the har.
; vesting.
Mr. C. has not pursued this cultivation
j sufficiently long to have matured a sys\
tcm of rotation, which, however, he vir;
tually practises with some variations,
J from his own judgment. A little moro
; experience will enable him to determine,
! whether a crop can he taken more ad;
vantageously every second or every third
year, hut we are satisfied, with a moderate
dressing for the corn, the rotation
might he of three years duration, afford,
ing alternately com, rye, and clover, the
last to be added entire when dry, to the
soil, for its improvement. Green crops
arc never used as improvers, they always
| hjing allowed to mature before turning
under. Plaster should always he added,
| unless ashes or lime can be more econo!
niially applied ; but the former is lirni|
ted in supply, and the latter is to be had
only at a price which will effectually pre:

Vet for the want of the application and

continue to live on in ignorant poverty,
when they might, with less toil, and the

have a competency. A single bar left
down in this practice, lets in the whole

the roller and plaster you get no clover ;
if you cut olT the clover when grown,
you get no subsequent crop ; or if you
crop too closely or rapidly, the cloverbearing
properties of the soil are exhausted,
and new manures, or years of idle,
wasteful fallow are necessary to resuscitate
it; whereas, by a careful observance
of the above plan, the ground is constantly
and profitably at work, bearing its

the remainder to itself, to enable it to coifit

Gentlemen : As the season for gathering
and housing corn is near at hand,
permit me, who have iiad some experience
in the culture and keeping of that
<rreat article of food, so necessary for the
0 1 J %
support of man and beast in America, to
to give you my mode of preserving it
from the depredations of weevil.
My practice is this: In the first place,
1 have removed from the corn house all
| the old shucks, blades, cobs, &c. of the
crop of the previous year among which
there are many weevil; then have the
floor at the erih washed well with water,
which drives all or the greater part of
these destructive insects from the crib;
then to every load in the shuck thrown
into the crib 1 apply one quart of line
salt, well sprinkled over the load after it
is thrown into the crib. When another
load is gathered and thrown in, another
quart of salt is applied in the same manner,
and this is repeated during the process
of hauling and housing. The exd
o
pense is trifling; the labor of doing it
! small; and the time consumed not inore
than a minute or so for each load. The
salt, say half a bushel at a time, is thrown
into a tub or some vessel sufficiently tight
to hold it ; this vessel is placed in one
corner of the crib, from which the quantity
fur each load can conveniently be
taken as wanted ; and scattered over tin'
corn. My d ircction to tho slave, whose
business it is to scatter the salt, is
? sprinkle it evenly over every part and
- i. I! '?
Sill II WI_ i>.
The idea of salting corn to prevent the
depredations of the weevil, was taken
some 10 or 12 years ago, from an agricultural
work, the title of which is not
now recollected. Since that period, I
have adopted the practice annually; and
from this experience of 10 or 12 years
am confident that this method entirely
prevents injury to the corn in the crib by
that destructive insect, except to some of
the outside cars, which the salt does net
reach. iMy corn in July and August,
and as long as it lasts, is as free from injury
by weevil as on the day it was
housed.
Salt is riot only used by me in preserv.
ing my corn, but 1 also use it when stacking
my rye and oats, sprinkling a pint or
so to every twoor three courses of sheaves
when stacking. Though 1 never heard
O D
that oats were injured by weevil, yet they
tare very destructive to rye and wheat
The latter article I have not succeeded in
raising ; have no douht however, but that
it can be preserved in the same manner,
from injury by that insect.

THE COTTON CROP FAILING.
There is now every reason to believe,
from what we hear from every direction,
that the crop of cotton will prove much less
than an average one. The forms and bolls
arc falling oft" in great quantities; and
the rust is destroying much. This is
what we hear from our own Mississippi
planters. From Alabama, we have the
same nows, as the following extract from
a letter, dated Aug. 14, will show:
441 have never seen such devastation in
I the cotton crop, in so short a time before.
Fifteen days ago, every body was to make
from 100Q to 1500 lbs. per acre?now,
from 3 to GOO at the outside, owing to a
cold spell we have had here for two weeks.
The cold North and Last winds prevailed
all the time, which causedtho cotton to
rust, stalk to dry, leaves and forms tc
drop."
The writer is an acquaintance of Dr.
Phillips's, and.sees, as we arc informed
t
I by Ihc Doctor, more of the planting in.
1 terest than one in a hundred. His testimony,
then, is to be relied on ; and a
gloomy story it tells of the cotton crop.
Even this, however, will produce good?
! for it will still press upon our planters the
salutary lesson we have so often urged,
thet they should attend less to the quantify
of their cotton?more to quality?and
more to corn, peas, bacon, sweet potatoes,
fruits, sheep, wool, silk, wheat, grasses,
&c. ?S. TF. Farmer.
MESSAGE.
From the President of the U. States, accompany.
ing a Treaty icith Great Britain.
! have the satisfaction to communicate to the
Senate the results of the negotiations recently
held in this city with the British Minister, special
and extraordinary.
These results comprise?
1st. A Treaty to settle and define the boundaries
between the territories of the United States and
the possessions of her Britannic Majesty in North
America, for the suppression of the African slave
trade, and the surrender of criminals, fugitives
from justice, in certain cases.
2d. A correspondence on the subject of the interference
of the Colonial authorities of the British
West Indies with American merchant vessels
driven by stress of weather, or carried by violence
into the ports of those colonies.
3d. A corrcsjwndencc upon the subject of the
attack and destruction of the steamboat Carolino.
4. A correspondence on the subject of impressment.
If this treaty shall receive the approbation of
the Senate, it will terminate a difference respecting
boundary which has long subsisted between the
two governments?has been the subject of several
ineffectual attempts at settlement, and has sometimes
led to great irritation, not without danger of
disturbing the existing peace. Both the United
States and the states more immediately concerned,
have entertained no doubt of the validity of the
American title to all the territory which has been
I in disoute; but that title was controverted, and
the government of the United .States had agreed
O O
to make the dispute a subject of arbitration. One
arbitration had been actually had, but had failed
to settle the controversy; and it was found, at the
commencement of last year, that a correspondence
had been in progress between the two governments
for a joint commission, with an ultimate reference
to an umpire or arbitrator, with authorily to make
a liual decision. That correspondence, however,
has been retarded by various occurrences, and
had come to no definite result when the special
mission of Lord Ashburton was announced. This
movement on the part of England afforded, in the
judgment of the Executive, a favorable opportunity
for making an attempt to settle this long existing
controversy by some agreement or treaty,!
without further reference to arbitration. It seemed
entirely proper that, if this purpose were entertained,
consultation should be had with the authorities
of the States of Maine and Massachusetts.
Letters, therefore, of which copies arc
herewith communicated, were addressed to the
Governors of those states, suggesting that commissioners
should be appointed by each of them, respectively,
to repair to this city and confer with
the authorities of this government on a line by
agreement or compromise, with its equivalents
and compensations. This suggestion was met by
both states in a spirit of candor and patriotism,
and promptly complied with. Four commissioners
on tiie part of Maine, and three on the part of
Massachusetts, all persons of distinction and high
character, were duly appointed and commissioned,

[ scat of the government of the United States.
' | These commissioners have been in correspondence
with this government during the period of the discussions
; have enjoyed its confidence and freest
communications; have aided the general object
with their counsel and advice; and in the end,
have unanimously signified their assent to the line
proposed in the treaty.
Ordinarily, it would be no easy task to reconcile
and bring togcthersuch a variety of interests in a
matter in itself difficult and perplexed ; but the efforts
of the government in attempting to accomplish this
desirable object, have been seconded and sustained
by a spirit of accommodation and conciliation on
1 the part of the States concerned, to which much
of the success of these efforts is to be ascribed.
Connected with the settlement of the line of the
j Northeastern boundary, so far as it respects the
j States of Maine and Massachusetts, is the continj
uation of that line along the highlands to the
northwcstcrnmost head of Connecticut river.
, Which of the sources of that stream is entitled to
this character, has been matter of controversy and
of some interest to the State of New Hampshire.
The King of the Netherlands decided the main
branch to be the north westernmost head of the
Connecticut. This did not satisfy the claim of
New Hampshire. The line agreed to in the pre4

Hall's stream, and thence down that river embracing
the whole claim of New Hampshire, and establishing
her title to 100,000 acres of territory,
j more than she would have had by the decision of
' the King of the Netherlands.
j
By the treaty of 1783, the line is to proceed
down the Connecticut river to the 45th degree of
north latitude, and thence west by that parallel,
till it strikes the St. Lawrence. Recent examinations
having ascertained that the line heretofore
received as the true line of latitude between those
points was erroneous, and that the correction of
this error would not only leave, on the British side,
a considerable tract of territory, heretofore sup
posed to belong to the States of Vermont and
New-York, but also Rouse's Point, the s'.tc of a
military work of the United States, it has nccn
regarded us un object of importance, not only to
establish the rights and jurisdiction of those States,
> upon the line to which they have been considered
i to extend, but also to comprehend Rouse's Point
within the territory of the United States. The
relinquishment, by the British Government, of all
I! the territory south of the line heretofore considered
1
I
I to be the true line, lias been obtained ; and the I
1 consideration for this relinquishment, is to enure ,
by the provisions of the treaty to the States of ,
.Maine and Massachusetts.
The line of boundary, then, from the sources i
of the St. Croix to the St. Lawrence, so far as
."Maine and Massachusetts arc concerned, is fixed
by their own consent and for considerations satis,
factory to them ; the chief of these considerations
being the privilege of transjwrting the lumber and
agricultural products grown and raised in Maine
on the waters of the St. John's and its tributaries i
I
I down that river to the ocean, free from imjHjeitioa
I or disability. The importance of this privilege,
j perpetual in its terms, to a country covered at present
by pine forests of great value, and much of
it capable hereafter of agricultural improvement,
is not a matter upon which the opinion of intelligent
men is likely to he divided,
So far as New Hampshire is concerned, the
treaty secures all that she requires, and New-York
and Vermont are quieted to the extent of their claim
and occupation. The difference which would be
made in the northern boundary of these two States,
by correcting the parallel of latitude, may be seen
in Tanner's Maps, (183G) now Atlas. Maps No*.
6 and 9.
From the intersection of the 45th deg. of north
latitude with the St. Lawrence, and aloug that
river and the lakes to the water communication
between Lake Huron and Lake Superior, the line
was definitely agreed on by the Commissioners of
the two Governments, under the 6th article of the
Treaty of Ghent. Hut between this last mentioned
point and the Lake of the Woods, the Commissioners
acting under the 7th artielc of that treaty
found several matters of disagreement, and therefore
made no joint report to their respective Governments.
The first of these was Sugar Island,
or St. George's Island, lying in St- Mary's river,
or the water communication between Lakes Huron
and Superior. By the present treaty this is|
land is embraced in the territories of the United
States. Both from soil and position, it is regarded
as of much value.
Another matter of difference was the manner of
extending the line from the point at which the
Commissioners arrived, north of Isle Royalc, in
Lake Superior, to the Lake of the Woods. The
British Conunissioners insisted on proceeding to
the Fond du Lac, at the southwest angle of the
Lake, and thcncc by the River St. Louis to the
Rainy Lake. The American Commissioner sup
terms of the treaty,, would, it is obvious, occasion,
j ally intersect Islands. The manner in which the
commissioners of the two Governments dealt with
this difficult subject, may be 6cen in their rejwrts.
But where the line, thus following the middle of
the river, or water course, did not meet with is- |
lands, yet it was liable sometimes to leave the
only practicable navigable channel altogether on
one side, The treaty made no provision for the
common use of the waters by the citizens and
subjects of both countries.
It has happened, therefore, in a few instances,
that the use of the river, in particular
places, would be greatly diminished,
to one party or the other, if in fact
there was not a choice in the use ofchan- :
nels and passages. Thus at the Long
Sault, in tlie St. Lawrence, a dangerous
passage, practicable only for boats, the
only safe run is between the Long Sault
islands and Barnhardt's island, all which
belong to the United States on one side, :
and the American shore on the other.?
On the other hand, by far the best pass ?go ,
for vessels of any depth of water, from]
J posed the true course to be to proceed by the way
of the Dog River. Attempts were made to compromise
this ditrercnce, but without success. The
details of these proceedings arc found at lengtli in
the printed, separate reports of the Commissioners.
From the imperfect knowledge of this remote
country, at the date of the treaty of peace, some
of the descriptions in that treaty do not harmonise
witli its natural features as now ascertained.
14 Long Lake" is no where to be under found that
name. There is reason for supposing, however, that
the sheet of water intended by that name, is the estuary
at the mouth of Pigeon River. The present
treaty adopts therefore that estuary and river, and
afterwards pursues the usual route, across the
height of land by the various portages and small
lakes, till the line reaches Rainy L*ke; from
which the Commisioners agreed on the extension
of it to its termination, in the northwest angle
of the Lake of the Woods. The region of country
on and near the shore of the Lake between
Pigeon River on the north, and Fond du Lac und
the River St. Louis on the south and west, considered
valuable as a mineral region, is thus included
within the United States. It embraces a
territory of four millions of acres, northward of the
claim set up the British Commissioner under the j
treaty of Ghent. From the height of land at the ;
head of Pineon River, westerly to the Rainy Lake,
the country is understood to be of little value, being
described by surveyors and marked on the
map as a region of rock and water.
From the north west angle of the Lake of the ,
Woods, wliich is found to be in latituJc 45 dcg.
23 min. 55 see. north, existing treaties require the j
line to be run due South to its intersection with
the 45th parallel, and thence along that parallel to ,
the Rocky Mountains.
After sundry informal communications with
the British Minister upon the subject of the claims
of the two countries to territory west of the Rocky .
Mountains, so little probability is found to exist of
coining to any agreement on that subject at present,
that it was not thought expedient to make it
one of the subjects of formal negotiation, to be en- j
tcrcd upon between this Government and the
British Minister, as part of his duties unier the ,
special mission.
By the treaty of 1783, the line of division along ,
the rivers and lakes, from the place where the 45th ;
parallel of north latitude strikes the St. Lawrence, i
to the outlet of Lake Superior, is invariably to be |
drawn through the middle of such waters, '
and not through the middle of their m ain channels.
Such a line if extended according to the literal
Lake Eric into the Detroit River, is between
Lois Rlanc, a British island, and
the Canadian shore. So again there are
several channels or passages, of different
degrees of facility and usefulness, betweenthe
several islands in the river St. Clair,
at or near its entry into the lake of Hlat
name. In these three cases the treaty
provides that all the several channels and;
passages shall be free and open to the
use of the citizens and subjects of botk
parties.
The treaty obligations subsisting between
the two countries for the suppression
of the African slave trade, and the
complaints made to this Government
within the last three or four years, many
of lliom but too well founded, of the Visitation,
seizure and detention of American
vessels on that coast, by British cruizers,
could not but form a delicate and highly
important part of the negotiations which
have now been held.
The early and prominent part which,
the Government of the United States
has taken for the abolition of this unlawful
and inhuman traffic, is well known.
By the tenth article of the treaty of
Ghent, it is declared that the traffic in
slaves is irrcconcileable with the principles
of humanity and justice, and that
both His Majesty and the United Slates
are desirous of continuing their efforts'!?
promote its entire abolition ; and it is
thereby agreed that both the contracting
parties shall use thoir best endeavors to
accomplish so dosiralde an object. The
Government of the United States has by
law declared the African slave trade piracy
; and at its suggestion other nations
have made similar enactments. It has
not been wantins in honest and zealous
t
efforts, made in conformity with the wornes
of the whole country, to accomplish
the entire abolition of traffic in slaves upon
tho African coast; but these efforts
and thoso of other countries, directed to
the same end, have proved, to a consider
- n * rn a!
able degree, unsuccessful. ireancs am
known to have been entered into some.,
years ogo between England and France,,
by which the former power, which usually
maintains a large naval force on the
African station, was authoriscd^to seiao
and bring in for adjudication, vessels
found engaged in the slave tro^e under
the French flag.
It is known that in December last, ,1
treaty was signed in London by the representatives
of England, France, Russia,
Prussia, and Austria, having for its pro-,
fesscd object a strong and unitei) eflbrt
the live powers to put an end to the tra&\
tic. This treaty was not officially com-,
municated to the Government of the
United States, hut its provisions and stij*.
ulatjons are supposed to be accurately
known to the public. It is understood ta
be not yet ratified on the part of France.
No application or request has been
made to this government to become party
to this treaty ; but the course it might
take in regard to it, has excited no small
degree of attention and discussion in Eu?

tains have caused warm animadvertion*
and great political excitement,
In my message at the commencement of the
present session of Congress, I endeavored to statu
the principles wliich this government supports
respecting the right of search and thc lnhnunity
of Hags.?Desirous of maintaining thogc principles
fully, at the same time that existing obligations
should be fulfilled, I have thought it most consistent
with the honor and dignity of the country,
that it should execute its own laws, and perform
its own obligations, by its own means and its own
power. The examination or visitation of the merchant
vessels of onenation by the cruisers of another,
for any purposes except those known and ac.
knowledgcd by the law of nations, under whatever
restraints or regulations it may take place, may lead
to dangerous results. It is far better by other
means, to supersede any supposed necessity, or any
motive for such examination or visit. Interference
with a merchant vessel by an armed cruiser is al.
ways a delicate proceeding, apt to touch the point
of national honor, as well as to affect the interests
of individuals. It has been thought, therefore, exj?odicnt,
not only in accordance with the stipula.
tions of the treaty of Ghent, but at the sainc timo
as removing all pretext on the part of others for
violating the immunities of the American flag
upon the seas, as they ex'st and are defined by the
law of nations, to enter into the articles now sub,
mitted to the Senate.
The treaty which I now submit to you,
proposes no alteration, mitigation, or modification
of the rules of the law of nations. It provides
simply that each of the two governments shall
maintain on the coast of Africa a sufficient squadron
to enforce, separately, and respectively, the
laws, rights, and obligations, of the two countries,
for the suppressions of the slave trade.
Another consideration of great imjwrtance has
recommended this mode of fulfilling the duties
and obligations of the country. Our commerce
along the western coast of Africa is extensive, and
supposed to be increasing. There is reason to
think that in many eases those engaged in it have
met with interruptions and annoyances, caused
by the jealousy and instigation of rivals engaged
in the same trade. Many complaints on this
subject have reached the government. A rcspcc.
table naval force on the coast is the natural resort
and security against farther ocurrcnccs of this kind.
