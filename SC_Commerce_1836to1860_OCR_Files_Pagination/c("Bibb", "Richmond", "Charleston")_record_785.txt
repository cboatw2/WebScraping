Fathers and Brethren, esteemed and beloved,—
The Church and the world have ceitainly arrived,
at a most important and eventful crisis in the rapid
development of. the means and agencies to be em
ployed for the glorious and universal spread of the
Redeemer’s kingdom. The great moral car of
Christian enterprise seems propelled on with the
velocity of the high-pressure system. Before it
the valleys rise, the mountains fall, and in its course
the verdant landscape smiles around. But let not
the Church suppose that her work is done, that her
warfare is accomplished until the kingdom whit
gjs set up by the God of heaven shall fill the w*10 e
earth. “
Much, very much, remains to be done by the
Church for the salvation of the world, before either
will be prepared for the>coming of the Lord. A
careful survey of the moral chart .of our world will
present, in bold relief, those dark places where
the habitations of cruelty, the depths of Satan, and
the mysteries of iniquity are still seen.
Let the Church be kept well informed of the
particular wants, the respective and comparative
claims of each portion and section of the wide field
which she is to occupy. Let those who occupy the
high places of our Zion at home; and those who
stand on her distant watch towers in foreign lands,
see eye to eye; let them lift up their voices togeth
er, and so much the more as we see the day ap
proaching. And, least of all, should the Methodist
Church relax or grow weary in her efforts, until
Scriptural light and holiness shall envelop the earth
around. Let the same holy inspiration that glowed
in the bosoms, and shone in the lives of her venera
ble founders,—her Wesleys, her Coke, and her
Asbury,—never cease to characterize the thousands
who serve at her altars,
j " Till earth’s remotest nation,
Has learned Messiah’s name.”
-
To the founders of our Church it was given to
impart the'light of life to thousands who sat in
darkness and the shadow of death on our Atlantic
shores. But for a Fisk, and others of our own day,
it has been reserved to conceive, and prosecute the
noble design of a transmontaine mission, to convey,
as on the wings of the morning, those same bles
sings to the uttermost boundaries of the west. And
now, as it is my present object and wish to engage
your interest, and secure your efforts in the behalf
of this far western field, I do most respectfully in
vite your attention to a few particulars relating to
our work in Oregon. And,
1st The interest we hold, and the relation we
sustain to the country. It must here be kept in
mind, that the country bordering on the lower wa
ters of the Columbia, embracing the valley of 4he
Willamitte, is our field, and properly belongs to the
Metfiodist mission. It was here that our mission
aries commenced, and here they continue to labour.
Whatever has here been done to improve the spiri
tual, moral, or intellectual condition of the people
has been done by the Methodist Church; and it is
perfectly plain that this field is assigned to us in
the providence of God, and that the Lord of the
vineyard holds us responsible how we occupy it
till he come. How deep our interest, and how im
portant our relations here!
2d. In the seoond place we will consider the im
portance of the field, which we are called to occu
py ; and on this subject I am prepared to say, that
irrespective of our Indian missions, which have
'been rq^itly reported by the superintendent, I do
honestiPRrlieve that the field committed to our
Church in Oregon is not second in importance to
any foreign field which she can occupy. The rich
and extensive valley of the Willamitte is already
regarded as the site and centre of civilization. The
flocks of the husbandman feed and lie down, and
the ploughshare of industry brightens in the soil,
where the haughty chief and savage warriors of
a departed race once marshaled their savage hosts.
And whatever be our sympathies for the red man,
we cannot resist the conviction, that when his
wasting race shall disappear, or be lost in amalga
mation, then agricultural districts, manufacturing
villages, and commercial towns, will occupy ‘these
fertile and extensive plains. The elements of a ra
pidly increasing population arb already here: more
than two hundred families are on the ground, and
the number is fast increasing. Many of the arts of
civilization are at present introduced. The spirit
of “go-ahead” predominates here, while every
thing, animate and inanimate, seems rushing to
maturity. Besides, such are the natural resources
and facilities for acquisition and commerce as to
place it beyond a doubt that Oregon must suddenly
rise to a rank in the civil and commercial world.
This, brethren, is our field. Here we have an
infant nation committed to our care, whose future
character and destiny will tell to posterity how we
have fulfilled our high and important trust
We may here pause, and adore the hand and
providence of God, which seemed to anticipate the
sudden rise of this new world, by sending his mes
sengers before-his face to prepare a way in the wil
derness, and lift up an ensign fof the people.
3d. I will call your attention to the. intellectual
.. and moral condition and wants of the foreign popu
lation of our adopted land: and here we shall see
JS?
some of the shades in the picture of semi-civilized
life. The emigrants composing our community
are mostly from Canada and our own western fron
tiers ; most of whom are unable to read. Their
native wives and their children are unable to speak
any civilized language. These native mothers are
incapable of exercising any Balutary influence or
control over the passions or action of their off
spring. -
Our youth are deprived of the advantages of ear
ly instruction and discipline, calculated to inspire
and encourage generous and virtuous principles;
and so exposed to every corrupting influence and
example, as to produce an early development of
all the depraved passions of fallen humanity as prac
tically exhibited in real life.
I would not be understood that these “are sin
ners above all men.” The fact is undeniable, that
wherever the light of science is withheld, and the
reign of ignorance is suffered to continue, it with
ers the intellect and blights the morals of the peo
ple. The truth of this remark is too painfully il
lustrated in the condition of Spanish America,
from Patagonia to Upper California. The very at
mosphere seems charged with a moral miasma, as
fatal to purity and virtue as the breath of the si
moon, as the touch of upasj to human life.
Already do we feel the contaminating influence
wafted on the southern breeze along the coast of
the Pacific. “ But it is Popery,” you say, “ with its
withering train of abominations, ihat has spread
desolation along the Pacific shores of our continent.”
You must know, also, that the mystery of iniqui
ty la already working here. , The Jesuit priests
are among us, practising with all “deceivableness
their lying wondersthey have wrested the word
of God from some who were taught to read it in
our sabbath schools, and many “such like things
do theywhich leads me to exclaim, alas, for
Oregon, if her sons and hoc daughters are to bo
denied the means of intellectual and moral- improve
ment, and to fall a helpless prey into the hands of
Romish priests 1 Better for them had they never
been born; and better, for us had we never, been
instrusted with the keys of knowledge, should we
close its doors against them. Let them be rescued
from the wiles of the destroyer, and fitted for the
duties and enjoyments of civil and domestic life*
and they udll stand forth monuments of Christian
enterprise, and living epistles, read and known of all
men, to declare with what fidelity and success we
bSve discharged our duties in their behalf.
4th. In the fourth place it remains for us to con
sider what is to be done, to meet the wants and
exigencies of the case. And here I think there can
be but one opinion. Ample and adequate means of
Intruction must be provided without delay. The
present and prospective literary wants of the coun
try should be fully and promptly met. The present
demand is for a boarding school, provided with sep
arate departments for males and females; where
our youth may be trained and instructed in the use
ful branches of English literature.
ai me same time we snouia so iar anticipate uiu
future demands, as to be prepared to take the lead
in the cause of literature, and secure its influence
in the behalf of Protestant Christianity in this land.
It will require not less than ten thousand dollars, to
provide necessary buildings and other apparatus,
&c., to commence such a school as is needed in
Oregon. This is a small sum to ask of the Metho
dist Episcopal Church. But small as it is, shall we
have it? How shall it be obtained! What propo
sition will you raise, brothers, on your circuit or sta
tion! How much will you give! and so on. It is
easily done, if all will take hold of it And how
will you evince your fidelity to the cause of God in
this land if you neglect it! Were I to propose a
plan I would say, let every travelling preacher
make an effort on his own circuit or station through
out our connection, and make returns, at, or before,
the time of the next General Conference, in 1844,
to the treasurer of our Missionary Board; and let
the treasurer designate and authorize some person
in Oregon to draw on him for such amounts as
shall have been received for said object.
It may be proper here to observe, that as mission
aries we do not feel ourselves at liberty to turn aside
from the specific work assigned us by the Board.
But at the same time, we have felt that something
must be done in the cause of education, and some
incipient measures have already been taken: a
Board of Trustees has been chosen, and some mon
ey is pledged on subscriptions, and we are resolved
that we must, and will have a school. What 'say
you to this subject!
It is the design of those concerned’, to have an
institution in all respects worthy of the confidence
and patronage of the Methodist Episcopal Church;
and permanently secured to such organized body
of said Church as will assume the responsibility.
Whether the Missionary Board, or some other, be
that body, we shall be glad of your opinion.
And now, brethren, allow me to inquire, does it
not fully appear from the facts and circumstances
in the case,
1st. That God, in his providence, assigns to us
this field:
2d. That this is an important field:
3d. That the condition and prospects of this
country imperiously demand immediate action:
4th. That our first and most important work
should be to provide for the literary wants of the
land!
The imploring eyes of this infant nation are
turned to us: her feeble hands are stretched forth
to us for aid: her dearest interests are confided to
our care. There is no time for delay: a moment’s
loss may be irretrievable. The mass is now flexi
ble and yielding, and ready to receive the imperisha
ble type of intelligence and virtue. In default of
which, the mark and image of the beast will rest
upon the length and breadth of the land.
Let the Methodist Church come forward in a
manner worthy of herself, and of the great work in
which she is engaged. Let her open and direct the
fountains of science in this new world, and secure
to herself a leading position in controlling its future
destinies. Thus will she add another star to her
crown, and another lucid page in her history will
tell the world that she is the friend of sinners, and
the friend of man!
This, brethren, is our last hope, our last resort.
Christianity can never elevate this people, the
Gospel can never triumph here, without the aid of
such an auxiliary. Grant but this, and you plant a
bow in the cloud; yea, a sun in the firmament of
the future prospects of Oregon. But deny her
this, and you turn her light into darkness, and her
morning into the shadow of death. Already along
ber distant horizon portentous clouds are gathering,
nocturnal shades condensing, and an ominous night
Bf Papal darkness in brooding over the land. To
ivert which, in the name of our common Christian
ity, and in the language of my motto, I appeal to
|rou, Men of Israel, help !
Most respectfully submitted, by a servant of the
Church, David Leslie.

“GONE HOME.”
Our obituary list the present week, will be found
peculiarly interesting, and rich in its details of tri
umphant deaths. Every month that rolls by in
creases our interest in the “Jerusalem which is
above, which is the mother of us all,” by remov
ing to its blessed habitations those whom we knew,
admired, and loved on earth. Thither are the steps
of all God’s true Israel on earth tending. Daily
are the portals of heaven crowded by those who go
to swell the number of these happy myriads who
have gone through great tribulation, and have
washed their robes and made them white in the
blood of the Lamb. During all the periods we
call day and night, does heaven keep a “ feast of
ingathering.” A little yghile, and we too, who
read these obituary notices, shall lie down on the
bed of death, around which shall fall the curtain
that shuts out the scenes and actors of this life,
and brings us to commune with eternity alcine.
Ala* for us then, if no light* shine , around our
death-pillow but thoae which philosophy or the
overweening self-righteousness of an earth-born
morality, may kindle. If our,religion is of earthly
origin; if it is made up only of creeds, dogmas,
and forms; if it has dwelt in the cold abstractions
of the mind, leaving the heart absorbed in the pur
suit of earth’s frivolities; if it has come by man,
and from, man, no matter by what line, through
what agencies, then let us in time be aroused to
the conviction that “by man cometh death." That
which is of the earth, is earthy. The stream can
not rise above the fountain’s level. . We shall per,
ish with all our religion upon our heads. Our hope
will lie down in the dust by our side; and leave us
forever undone. ■ V ■ *
Nor need we marvel at the seeming strangeness
of such a sentiment Eternity’s “ far off land’’
lies entirely beyond the range, both of our natural
habitudes of thought and the daily current of our
feelings and sentiments. Its component elements,
its modes of existence, its dread novelties, its
strange and infinite depths, its unknown states of
feeling,—all so different from earth’s scenes and
occupations, must,' from the necessity of the case,
break with appalling suddenness and strangeness
upon a human spirit that has pissed its earthly
sojourn in the present state. There needs how
vast a change before our present knowledge, tastes,
sympathies, objects of pursuit, and habits of feeling
can harmonize with that spiritual economy where
God is unveiled in the glorious holiness of his
character, in the searching light of his perfections.
What tie hold we in common with that spirit-race
which peoples eternity’s dread realm 1 What com
munion with the unearthly pursuits which engage
the aboriginal nations of heaven in their spiritual
and unseen home 1 The bravest heart quails before
the terrors of a contact with the spectral forms
that are supposed to flit ever and anon, at dead of
night, around some lone haunted spot -How abrupt
and startling must be the transition, then, from the
breathing throng of flesh and blood, that here
surrounds us, to that unknown country where spir
its alone dwell 1 How mighty and indescribable the
change which makes one a spiritual inhabitant of a
spiritual, eternal world 1 f.
To produce the changes in thought, feeling, af
fection, desire, pursuits, which shall fit. us for
this dread transition, is the special province of
a Christianity of spiritual grace and power. Faith
in Christ, is the medium and instrumental cause of
this change. But what sort of faith ? Why such
a faith as realizes the existence and merijof the
“ second Adam, the Lord from heavensuch a
faith as receives pardon, peace, and spiritual life
from the “ last Adam who is made a quickening
spiritsjich a faith as unites us to Christ, and
makes him with special emplflais, “ our life." It
iB the prerogative of this vital principle to reverse
the natural order of things, and make the things'
which are seen and temporal, subordinate in impres
sion and influence upon us, to the things which are
unseen and eternal. Nay, it is itself, the substance
of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.'
It carries our hearts into the region of light and
intellect, of love and holiness, and makes them
at home there. It brings into the soul, while on
earth, an element which renders eternal things
congenial to thought and feeling. It begets a prin
ciple which heaven does not change but only ma
ture. It produces a realizing experience of Christ’s
word,—“ th^vater that I shall give him, shall be
in him, a well of water springing up into everlast
ing life.”
Now this state of things, no word, writing, cer
emony, or power of man, can bring about within
us. Such an experience comes only from heaven.
Let that be well observed. And then, when it
does come in a heart-renewing efficacy, it makes it
self known. What need of reasoning and specu
lation, of running hither and thither, to enquire
about the matter. “ The kiftgdom of God is with
in you;” and its self-evidencing power puts doubt
and fear to flight, “ I know in whom I have Be
lieved,”—the renewed man can say; “and am
persuaded that he is able to keep that which I
have committed unto him against that day.” The
alternations of hope and fear, of agitation and tem
porary quiet, give place to a persuasion full of as
surance, a “joy unspeakable and full of glory.”
lie now stands before us as actually related to that
future and eternal state. It is his inheritance,—
in the heavens it may be; but then he is the heir;
separated as yet, indeed, by many a weary league
from his father-land; but nevertheless pursuing
his pilgrim journey to that heavenly home. Al
though subject to human law, and yet in the body,
he already has come to Mount Zion, the city of the
living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and claims
citizenship with the spirits of just men made per
fect. When such a man dies, may we not emphat
ically say of him, that he has “gone home.”

WHY SHOULD NOT PRINTERS HAVE A
SABBATH1
Hundreds of printers engaged in the daily press
of the country, know no Sabbath. The church
bell sounds not for them. The gospel preached to
others, has no message for them. Christian peo
ple have stood by and looked on with apathy, con
tent, if they only received the latest news on Mon
day morning, even though the price for it might be
the^pinter’s conscience and the risk of his soul.
In such a state of things, while the friends of the
Christian Sabbath scarcely allowed themselves to
hope for any speedy change in the conventional
arrangements by which printers were doomed to
know no day of religious privilege, close upon the
heels of the ordinance which abolished Sunday
markets, comes the following determination of the
Charleston Mercury, one of the most influential
presses in the United States, by which the upas
tree of Sabbath desecration in that office is cut
down by a single blow.
“After much consideration,” says the Mercury,
“ we have determined to try the experiment of abol
ishing Sunday work in the Mercury Office. Our
Monday morning’s paper will henceforth be made
up on Saturday, with a postscript head, under which
will be given all important news by Sunday’s
mails. Our customers, if they approve our plan,
will send in their advertisements on Saturday. We
hope the community will sustain us in a move
which we consider of real importance to the com
fort end character of those we employ. We should
have adopted it long since, but for the want of as
surance on this point, and we do it now, not with
out anxiety as to the result To all others but prin
ters, Sunday is a day of rest,—set apart for sacred
objects in accordance with the general religious
faith of the community,—why should it be to us a
day even of unusual labour and care 1 Toothers
it is £ day of devotion and religious instruction,—
why should printers, alone of all, be deprived of its
good influences, of its rest, its support, its instruc
tions? The evil is a double one.. A large portion
of those employed in the office of a daily paper, are
boys and young journeymen, with unformed char
acters. After a week of severe labour and con
finement, they are thrown upon theirown resources
for amusement on Saturday, when every body else
is busy. Is it strange if they are tempted to dissi
pation, and if in a course of years, this circumstance
shall have exerted the most pernicious influence
upon their characters 1 We have long deplored the'
fatal effect upon too many, of this Sunday labour
and Saturday rest,—and if there were no other
reason for the? change, we would attempt it for the
sake of the printers alone. But there are many
others,—obvious and cogent reasons, that will be
present to every one’s mind, and that we need not
enumerate. We shall use every exertion, that the
change may not impair in any respect the interest
or usefulness of our paper,—and in the full confi
dence that we are forwarding an important and
much needed reform, we rely on the approbation
and support of the community.”
Such a confidence. will never be doomed to dis
appointment. Sooner shall the pillars of heaven
fail. That guardian Providence which watches
over the interests of communities, will most as
suredly prosper such a movement All truly re
ligious men of whatever creed or political princi
ples, will honour such a proceeding. Even the ir
religious must approve of a course dictated by
conscience and promotive, to so high a degree, of
public virtue. And if our information is correct
the experience of a very few days has showed that
the Mercury will be no loser, but a large gainer, in
the long run, by the manly stand it has taken on this
subject. * Its editor is known as one of the bright
ets ornaments in the corps.editorial, of this or any
country. The strength, breadth of information,
sparkling wit felicitous humour, which are embo
died in his editorial columns, render him deservedly
a favourite -even among those who do not go with
him in politics. His noble advocacy of the tem
perance cause, withal, presents an additional claim
to large and sustained patronage. We hope that a
large number of our friends in the interior of this
state and of Georgia, particularity of those whose
political opinions coincide with th9 opinions of the
Mercury, will take occasion to do honour to its
present noble and virtuous position in reference to
the Lord’s Day. Since the movement made by
the Mercury, the Savannah Georgian and the Au
‘gusta Chronicle and Sentinel have announced
a similar determination.
ABOLITIONISM IN THE NEW ENGLAND
CONFERENCE.
An address on slavery from the New England
Conference t6 the members of the M. E. Church
within its bopnds, is published in the Herald and
Journal of the 16th inst This document indig
nantly repudiates the idea of the unity of the M.
E. Church in any such sense as involves the fel
lowship of Southern Methodists on the part of their
New England brethren. It brands slaveholding
Methodists, whatever their circumstances, as siti
ners; and maintains that the main purpose of send
ing delegates to the General Conference from New
England is to protest against the sins of the South,
—and not for the object of worshipping, delibera
ting and praying on the same flour with the South
ern sinners ! It represents the prospects of aboli- j
tionism as “cheering in the extreme;” regards
the opening of the columns of the Christian Advo
cate and Journal to the discussion of the subject,
restricted and partial as it is, aB a decided advance
of the cause ; and hails with delight the recent ac
tion of the Baltimore Conference by which it de
prived the wives of four of its ministers of certain
servants held for them by trustees. The action of
the late New England Conferences is stated to
have been free, full and unanimous against the
great evil! m
Thus it appears that the full force of ecclesiasti.
cal opinion and action, is brought to bear upon civil
and social relations, that come only within the pro
vince of Cesar. And this too, directly against the
precedent given in the apostolical institution of
Christianity. Our New England enemies,—friends
they will not let us call them, least of all brethren,
—have struck another blow at the foundations of
our ecclesiastical union. How many more it shall
be able to stand, remains to kg seen.

WALTERBOROUGH.
We had the pleasure to attend, in company with
the Presiding Elder of this district, a four days’ j
meeting at Walterborough which commenced on the
12th inst The change from the confinement of an
editor’s office even to hard preaching, day and
night, was agrcable, albeit there was not much
relaxation in it, Walterborough is a handsome
little town in Colleton district, about fifty miles
from Charleston. It numbers upwards of a thous
and souls, and is evidently on the increase. In this
community, intelligence and wealth are happily I
blended, to a considerable extent, with evangelical!
religion. Situated on an elevated pine ridge, it is
perfectly safe from the fevers which prevail in the
low country; and has long been famed for its
healthfulness; and but for its remoteness from the
rail-road it would doubtless be a very favourite re
sort from this city in the summer. We had the
pleasure to bring forward the interests of the Bible
cause, in a sermon preached at the request of the
managers of the. parish society which has recently
made a fresh and vigorous start in the good work of
supplying the destitution of the district. The oc
casion was one of considerable interest and will
tell very favourably we hope, on the religious char
acter and prospects of that entire section of country.
The Executive Committee of the State Convention,
was not forgotten; and Walterborough, we think
will likely take the lead in assisting the Committee
to meet the liabilities incurred by them, last year, j
by supporting an agent for the state. .The debt |
amounts to something like $400: which fact, the
Bible Societies of the interior would do well to
bearin mind.
The religious exercises of the meeting were
such, we trusit, as will, by the blessing of God,
leave valuable results behind. The Methodist
Church was crowded at each public Service; the
truth delivered was listened to with marked and
solemn attention; and the fruit will be seen, we
doubt not, in the great day of Jesus Christ. * "T '

, We learn that the prospects of this young and
vigorous institution are good for the term that has
just commenced. A correspondent at Oxford says:
Our College opens well. The chasm made in our
ranks by the recent graduating class, will be about
supplied by the number who enter for the present,
term.' Still larger accessions are anticipated at the
opening of the January term.' Good health and
uninterrupted harmony,—little wealth, but great
plenty,—with an intelligent and growing population,
are still the' striking characteristic of our lovely
“ city in the woods.” •, ' ' '‘sS-j-wtfin

The Rev. Robert Boyd.—From the leading
editorial of the last Pittsburgh Advocate, it appears
that the Pittsburgh Conference fleeted as one of
their delegation to the General Conference, the
Rev. Robert Boyd, who has acquired some notoriety
from breaking a lance with the senior editor of the
Christian Advocate and Journal, when some thir
teen months before they censured by formal reso
lution the same man for a very unjustifiable course
of conduct.) It would seem from this that abolition
ism is decidedly in the ascendant in that Conference,
since Mr. Boyd’s abolitionism is the only, recom
mendation for the poet of honour assigned him.
But the editor of the Pittsburgh paper says dis
tinctly that this is not the case. He accounts for
Mr. Boyd’s election in a way that reflects no great
credit on the Conference. He says;—“Toward the
close of the year, we understood that there was an
extensive correspondence of an electioneering cast
carried on, though, as we were among the proscrib
ed, we did not share in it On reaching the Con
ference we were told that things were nearly ma
tured, and that the friends of brother Boyd were
determined, if possible, to elect him. We did not
hear that he had any hand in it, and do not believe he
had. The plan- was, to offer to vote for any favor
ite any brother might have, provided he would vote
for one that might be named to him. As almost every
one had some friend he wished thus to honour, the
‘ bargain and sale’ was agreed to in many instances.
This is what politicions call, we believe, ‘ log-rol
ling.’ While thus many votes were secured, others
were rolling for their friends, and made similar
propositions which were readily assented to; and
in this way a bare majority was effected^. Brother
Boyd was elected by one vote.”
Brother Cooke adds the following remarks, which
are worthy of attention,
1. We cannot but think the principle an inex
pedient one, that because a man has been to the
General Conference he should not go again. It
may be a reason why he should go, because he has
some experience, and may be presumed to under
stand how to subserve the interests of his confer
ence a little better than if he had never acted in
that relation. If a man has shown incapacity, or
has been recreant to the trust reposed in him, or has
grown proud of office, showing contempt for others
in all other respects his equals, if not superiors, or
by any other means has rendered himself unworthy
a re-election, he should certainly be permitted to
remain in a more private relation. But the naked
fact that he has served is only a child’s reason why
he should not serve again; a man should be ashamed
of it.
2. We think electioneering in ecclessiastical
bodies a great evil. It forms parties where we
should be one,—‘dwelling together in unity,’—and
* keeping the unity of the Spirit, in the bonds of
peace.’ It gives a designing man a chance to wield
an influence with which he should not be entrusted.
It places in a representative relation, persons who
do not and cannot represent their constituents. For
instance, if we are right in our judgment of the
views of Conference, brother Boyd, as an honest
abolitionist goes to represent us by purchased votes.
When at the General Conference, he must,—he
ought,—he will vote agreeably to his own views.
If the question should be agitated : Shall a rule be
made to exclude all slaveholders from the M. E.
Church, ‘ whatever be the peculiar circumstances
of the case V is it the will of the Pittsburgh Con
ference that her delegates should vote in the af

3. We sincerely deprecate elections because of
the temptations to electioneering; and rejoice we
have so few of them among us. That there should
be some is evidently important, but when they are
to take place we should look over the field of living
and competent men, and make a selection in the
fear of God, each for himself.
Protestantism in France.—What amount of
freedom the Protestant religion enjoys in France
may easily be estimated from the following remarks
made in the Chamber of Peers, by the Duke de
Broglie, in April last, and quoted by a foreign cor
respondent of the Presbyterian:
“Thejurisprudence of that court (the Court of
Errors) appears now to be fixed to a construction of
the fifth article of the charter, the reverse of the
intention of its framers. Hence, in the first place,
no religious denomination can at present exist in
France, unless established by law, or authorized by
the administration; which may refuse its sanction,
if it think fit, propose any condition that seems good
to it, and revoke it when it pleases. Secondly, it
follows, that worship, even when authorized by the
administration, cannot be celebrated in any place
whatever, without the permission of the magistrate,
who can refuse that permission,'and by so doing,
nullify the mandate of the law, and the sanction of
the superior government We cannot, in my opin
ion, consider an administration as establishing reli
gious liberty, which subjects the free exercise of
religion to two previous sources and acts of author
ity. What would you say of a law concerning
newspapers, which should declare, that the liberty
of the newspaper press exists in Prance; but no’; >
newspaper shall be allowed to exist, unless estab
lished bylaw, and authorized by the administration;
and further, it shall not be allowed to be circulated
in any locality without the pennission of the muni*,
cipal magistrate. As for ope, I think that the pret- ,
ent itaje o/-thing$ jg not compatible with ike fifth
artictmjf lie charier," '
Another Official Pafeb—The Northern Ad
vocate ; is out in .favor of a new periodical to sup*;
ply a vacancy. * ’We approve of the suggestion, and.
hope the General Conference will entertain it. It *-,
is, that there'should be established at New York, a
monthly, exclusively devoted to the preservation of *
the best sermons of living ministers in the M. E.
Church, tt is alleged that our old Magazines ire
Ojiiefly valuable on account of the sermons they con- %
tain. We see n6 reason why the expense of having
an editor exclusively for the proposed paper
be incurred. The editorial corps at the great em
porium will be competent, in all respects to manage'
this business. It will add to their labor of course,
but Methodist preachers are, and must continue to
be, laboring men, if Methodism would continue to
prevail. So says the Pittsburgh Advocate, in which
8Uggestion otir brother of the Richmond Advocate
coincides. We agree with all of them. * ■
Field Preaching once more in Great Britain,
— The Dumfries Standard gives a graphic account
of a great “ field meeting” held on the 18th June,
in the grounds of Mr. Burnie, by the Rev. Mr,, *
Buchanan, of the Free Scotch Church. The Se
cession Church not being large enough to accommo
date the throng of persons assembled, the preacher
conducted divine service in the open dir. He is
represented to have preached with great unction
and power, and with evident success. The following
Sabbath, still greater crowds were in attendance.
The day was as serene, but the wind much higher
j than on the preceding occasion, so that they had to
group more closely together,—all was attention,—
every eye was arrested, and, unobservant of all oth
er external objects, fixed anxiously on the eminent
and distinguished servant of God. Many felt it a
season of sweet consolation,—and all seemed deeply
impressed with the truths delivered. Who can
doubt the ultimate success of a church in favour of
which the mass of the people is up and in motion
Melancholy Incident—The Boston Journal*
gives the following particulars of a catastrophe
which happened on the first of February last, at the
Falls of the Willamette river, near the Methodist
mission in Oregon. Mr. Cornelius Rogers, Mrs.
Rogers, her sister Miss Leslie, Squire Crocker, and
two Clatsop Indians, were drowned, the boat while
passing the rapids above, being accidentally carried
over the Falls; Mr. Rogers went to Oregon from
Cincinnati, in the spring of 1838, in Company with
the missionaries of the A. B. C. F. M, to aid them
in the Christian labours among the Indians there._
He was a volunteer bearing his own expenses. Af.
ter labouring three or four years with them, he mar
ried a daughter of the Rev. Mr. Leslie, of the Me
thodist Mission on the Willamette, and took up his
residence near that Mission. He was an enterpri
sing Christian man,—-just the sort of man that a ri
sing community like that needs.
Impudence.—The Commercial Advertiser says;
“One of the newly elected school-officers,—of the
class now labouring to build up an array of heathen
schools,—the other day stalked into one of the pri
mary schools of the Public School Society, in the
city of New-York, and demanded of the teacher
that she cease from reading the Bible on the open
ing of her school, on pain of having her salary stop,
ped! The lady teacher very properly informed the
intruder that she should omit reading the Bible to
her charge, only when directed to do so by those
who placed her there. : " ...
A New Paper.—It is reported in the New York
papers that the anti-Puseyite section of the Episco- ;
pal church in that city are about to commence a
new periodical, in opposition to the Churchman. It
is intended that it shall be conducted by a layman,
in the same spirit as the excellent Episcopal Re-'
corder, of Philadelphia. -

A VACATION RAMBLE.—NO. L
Dear Brother Wightmar^—After the interesting
and exciting scenes of our recent College com.
mencement had passed away, and our students, to
gether with the large and intelligent assemblage of
our fellow-citizens who had honoured us with their
presence on that occasion, had mostly retired to,
their homes, I determined to improve a portion of
our limited vacation by a short excursion to the
North-western region of our State, which I had
long desired to visit, but which, from the pressure
of professional and other engagements, I had never
been able to reach. Leaving, therefore, the quiet
population of our lovely “village in the woodlands,”
to recover from the collapse which had necessarily
come on after the late excitement, and abandoning •
for one brief fortnight, the fumes and fatigues of the
laboratory for the incidents and vicissitudes#travel,
I set out in company with our respected President,
Judge Longstreet, whose private affairs required his
presence in Alabama, and whose route, for fifty or
sixty miles, fortunately, corresponded with that
which I had designed to take. The high personal
gratification which the trip in question has afforded,
arising as well from the topographical, geological,
and mineralogical features of the country, as from
the kind greeting of friends, and the formation of
new and agreeable acquaintances, has led me to beg
a place in your columns for a few details, which, I*
trust, may not prove unacceptable, at least to those
of congenial tastes and kindred habits.
The first point at which my narrative finds us, is
on the road to Decatur, De Kalb county, at the foot
of Little Red Lane, sparingly seated on an old log
I of rather scanty dimensions, and tenaciously fin
gering a timely luncheon, taken from the Judge’s
j sulkey box, while our panting horses, with pendant
I eye-lids and flexed houghs, patiently enjoyed the
shade, and a lazy spring oozed out its waters to the
sunshine amid a plashy flat that bordered the road.
A gourd, borrowed from a neighbouring cabin, ena
bled us to wash down our frugal meal, and we again
mounted, and were under way. At Mr. Latimer’s,
ten miles from Decatur, we expected to procure
some food for our horses,—rest a few hours, and
then reach the village before nightfall. We ar«*
rived,—had our horses fed, and after two hours’
delay, had ordered them, and were on the eve of
setting out, when our kind and thoughtful hostess
recalled us, and would not suffer us to leave until
we had honoured her table, by partaking of an am
ple and well dressed meal, for which she is deserv
efy celebrated. Her light, spbngy, saleratus bis
cuit, and clear, well-drawn coffee, gave no ques
tionable character to the repast; and it was denom*
