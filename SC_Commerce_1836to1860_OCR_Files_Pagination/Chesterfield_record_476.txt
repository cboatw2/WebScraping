think from the hints I have received that
I can make my farm much more profitable
than I have ever done. I know that
? manure is the main thing on any farm,
but 1 do not recollect that you have given
your opinion of the value of ashes. I
hear very different accounts from those
who have tried them, and I should like to
know on what soils they operate best, I
have land which is heavy with clay, and
I have gravelly and sandy lands.
Yours, WALPOLE.
Jan. 22, 1840.
We have often spoken ;r. the early!
numbers of our pape: of t..e veduv of ashes
on certain sods From the ?:umerous
trials which we have nude we .arc; inclined
to think u.-m s h oeficial on ail dry
soils; but on wot an.l heavv grounds tiiev
f C? J
are decidedly had?thry tend to mak
tlie soil still more heavy and retentive of
moisture, and consequently they intro
duce moss. W ken sown on the surface,
on heavy, clayey grounds, they will often
increase the grass harvest at tiist, hut as
their tendency is to render soil.-, more
heavy and clammy, they should bo applied
to those only which are light.
We have heard some farmers object to
putting ashes on their dry sandy soils,
' m ? -1 -All'
lest they should ttius render uiein suu
more dry and light, but a very little re.
flection or experience may teach any one
that the tendency of ashes is to render
light soils more compact; and to make
them retain moisture through the whole
season.
Farmers on Long Lland, X. Y., have
often purchased leached ashes in Maine.
and used them to good advan'age. Much
of the soil of that island is sandy, and those!
ashes have always there operated well.?
^ But why will tire farmers on the Kennebee
river sell these ashes?or why will
they suffer the soap boilers to send them
to a distance ? It is because much of the
land on the Iveunebec is clayey, and a
great majority of the farmers there think
they are good for nothing as a manure.
There is much land however on the banks
of the Kennebec tnat would be greatly
improved by the use of ashes, but we
would not advise to put them in large
quantities on any clayey soil. On green,
sward land small quantities of unleached
ashes may often be used to advantage to
give vegetation a start. These are full
of lie, and they effect a very rapid decomposition
of all the vegetable matter
within their reach?therefore there can
be no objection to putting small quantities
of these unleached ashes into hills of
corn or polatoes?the lye would work well
to rot all the decomposable matter in the
green-sward, while the quantity used
could not much affect the soil, after the
first season.
Leached ashes may be purchased in
many parts of Massachusetts for live or
six cents per bushel?a cart load for a
yoke of oxen might cost one dollar and a
hair?on any gravelly or sandy soils twenty
loads of these to an acre would be a
good dressing for any crop?and their
beneficial effects will prove much more
lasting than any kind of stable manure?
they will alter in some degree the nature
of the soil.
When ashes are used on corn hills,
they should be applied as soon as the
corn is planted?it is then less labor, and
? A. _ I. I
they operate quicker on trie vegeiaoic
matter in the soil?but strong ashes must
not be put in the hill with the corn?the
lye will eat off the tender roots of the
corn, and will often destroy the stalk.

OF SUCKERS ON CORN.

of <hecountry about IVedee.you seem tor- gari
t lie fici, of Surke b 01 corn bearing a1
th?'ir proper places, as before uukn<?w;i toyou
and you nsk, if it is not one of the peeoiiarilie
of tbe Corn colli-ated by Col. UTo-mis, ii
producing suckers beu" ing ear*! I can eaai!;
answer that ques* ion by cb*<rvmg that it i
not peculiar to Coi. Williams, species ol Corn
unless his and mine are (lie same, winch
| lluiik scarcely pnilubl'V and it ha? b*eu in
i settled conviction front several years c ose ob
I servation, thai Indian Corn, when tliero is
superfluiiy of sir* ngth in the soii for its owi
wan's, will send out suckers, winch if suffere
to remain, wnl not only do no injury to thi
parent stalk, but wiil, in corn and blades
produce more than ): igina) stalk witliou
them. That this is o newly formed opinio
of mine, you can, by referring to tbe June nuni
ber ol the Southern Agriculturist for 183*
and in an article on this subject, see that
came to the same conclusion from my lira
years' observation.
Coin highly manured, when not planted to
thick, will begin to send out suckers whei
about from six inches to knee high, and i
those early suckers are suffered to remain, aiv
if the hold is well cultivated, they will grov
off rapidly, detach roots of their own, thoug!
they adhere still to the parent stalk; tasse
sle ot, and ripen, at tiiesame time; and if th
Bilkers appear very early on the Corn, there i
often -ome d fficulty in discovering which is th
p rent and which the offspring.
In 1838, I made the fairest t-xperiiner
that could be with suckers. It was a dr
Spring and a great in my appeared on m
manured Corn. In a held of thirty hve acret
1 left eight rows lengthwise throughoc
the held with the suckers on; from the rest <
held I had them taken away; and I was s
fully satisfied wiih the result of that trial, tha
I have never taken them away from tny Cor
since. The quan'ity of fodder was so muc
greater than upon the adjoining rows, tha
there could be no doubt of the propriety c
leaving suckers to produce a farg
yield of fodder, and that nothing was lot
in the produce of grain, the following extract
from my Agricultural Journal of ihat year wi
show. The Corn wag planted lour and a ha
feet each way, one stalk in each hill, was we
manured with Cotion seed, s:able and yard iim
i.ure. in nearly equ i] proportions, and wai
careful!) cultivated.
August l.j.? 1 counted nineteen ears <
Com upon tight fobs in 's tick
in one place; upon which the suckers ha
j had been left. Oil ifiesamer-w adjoining,
counted sixteen ears, upon eight lulls, froi

In iiioiin r place, I counted upon eight In!
i nineteen year.-u;?ou the stalks with sucker
j and thirteen e? s mi the same row on ?igl
hills upon the stalks without In
another place fifteen tars upon the stall
with suckers, and twelve 01 those witiinu
The fodder on the eight rows throng hoi
the field must have been treble as much i
upon any other eight rows in the held."

ceplible o: improvement is loo plain a case
for argument* Tlie following plain statement
of fuels by lJr. Humphreys, in relaHon
to the agriculture of Croat Bri.aiu
will sei the ma iter at rest especially wh-ni
. it is considered that in lhat country agri'
cultural improvements ate fur 111 advance
1 j of those in the United States.
' j It is the opinion of competent judges,"
g j says Dr. Humphreys, "that the advances
i mniifi in iim Horiculturo of(?rcat Britain,
fl j ? -nv
| during t he last seventy or eighty years, are
* j senrcoly exceeded by the improvement am!
't j exertion of its manufactures, within the
* ] same pi riod; and that to these advances, no
^ j other old settled country f :rnishcs any
* } parallel. That they have been very rap?
; id indeed, the following figures and comil;
parisons abundantly show. In 17C0, the!
? | total growth of all kinds of grain in the
!? island of(ircat Britain, including England.
1 | Scotland and Wales, was estimated at i
' j 170 millions of bushels. In 183.), the
I ! quantity could not have been less than 340
I ; millions of bushels. In 1755, the populat
; tion of the whole island did not exceed 7,00,000.
1 It now (1833) probably is between 17 and 13
o million!, being an increase of 10 millions or
n j more than 130 per rent. Now the improveif
inents in agriculture have mere than kept pice
d with this prodigious increase of demand for its j
v varr us productions, for it in agreed on all hands j
h that the population now is much fuller fed, and j
I, 1 on provisions of a much better quality, than i
e that of 1755. Nor is Great Britain indebted!
s ! at all at present to foreign markets for li*?r ?up- |
e ! plies. $ince 1832, she has imported no grain J
j worth mentioning; and till within the last six J
it | months prices have been so depressed as to
y | call forth loud complaints from the whole agriy
j cultural interest of the country* England is
<, 1 at this mom.*lit, (1837) so far from wanting
it i any of our bread stuffs if we had them to ex?f
! port, that she has been supplying us liberally,
o ail the wili er, from her own granaries. And
it I yet it is the opinion of tnen of the first respect*
n ' ability in England, that the raw produce ofthe
h j island might be well nigh doubled without belt
j ing dependant on foreign countries for a supply.
>f That i- to s iy, 35 millions of people might draw :

its natural fertility. "Necessity is the molt

the most prominent of these may b

also stimulates to the cultivation (or rathe
the carrying on, as it is called,) of too larg
farms. By seemingly trifling diffeience in th
mode of cultivation, one acre may be made t

The Prospective Pre-Emption Bill.
Tuesday. January 12, 1841.
The bill to cstabiish a permanent pre
pective pre-emption system, in favor
settlers on the public lands, who shall i
habit and cultivate the same, and raise
log cabin thereon, being the special ord
of the day, was taken up, the question b

den to recommit the bill, with instructioi
to report a bill to distribute the procee

Vl fcMV I w
States, which Mr. Caliioun offered to
mend, by substituting a bill to cede tl
public lands to (he States in which tlx
lie, upon certain conditions.
Mr. Calhoun saiJ : I regard the qiif
tion of the public lands, next to that
the currency, the most dangerous ai
difficult of all which demand the atte
tion of the country and the Governme
at this important juncture of our affhii
I do not except a protective tariff, for
cannot believe, after what we have exj:
rienccd, that a measure can again
adopted, which has done more to corru
the morals of the country, public and p
vate, to disorder its currency, derange
business, and to weaken and endanger
free institutions, than any other, exec
the paper system, with which it js so i
timatcly allied.
Ha<Z
JiiY 17, 1841.
e In ofTv3r?Tig the amendment I propose, I
e do not intend to controvert the justice of
? the eulogium which has been so often
u pronounced on our land system, in the j
r) coarse of this discussion. On the con- j
trary, I believe that it was adi&irabiy ad-!
il justed to effect its object, when first ad op- I
? ted ; but it must be borne in mind that a
'* measure, to be perfect, mast be adapted
to circumstances and that great changes
j have taken place, in the lapse of fifty
years, since the adoption of our land sys- j
i. tern. At that time, the vast region Hour !
- covered by the new States, which
(J have grown up on the public domain,
e belonged to foreign powers, or was
? occupied by numerous Indian tribes, with
y the exception of a few sparse settlements,
e on the inc< nsiderable tracts to which the
o title of the Indians was at that time exil
tinguished. Since then, a mighty change
11 has taken place. Nine States have
l* sprung up as if by magic, with a popula"
tion not less, probably, than two-fifths of
e the old States, and destiaed to surpass
e them in a few years in numbers, power,
o and influence. That a change so mighty
8. should so derange a system intended for
y an entirely different condition of things
as to render important changes necessary
j* to adapt it to present circumstances, is
j. no more than might have been anticipated.
It would, indeed, have been a mira*
"I^ korl it linnn nthnruridu ? nnil tV<? niHrhf.
i, ">*? ** O"""' I
n not, therefore, to be surprised, that the
y operation of the system should afford
* daily evidence that it is not only deranged,
.* but deeply deranged, and that its deranger.
nient is followed by a train of evils that
rg threaten disaster,^ unless a timely and
it efficient remedy should be applied. I
I'- would ask those who think dilferentlv,
~ and who believe the system still continued
to work well, was it no evil, that session,
ff I
J alter session, for the last ten or twelve
a years, Congress should be engaged in an10
gry and deeply agitating discussions,
is growing out of the public lands, in which
- oneside should be denounced as th. friends
in and the other as the enemies, of the new
States? Was the increasing violence of
j, this agitat on, from year to year, and
v tnreateniag ulti-nitely, not only the
c. loss of the public domain, but the tranquilty
ity and peace of the country, no evil ?
Is it well that one-third of the time of
y Congress is consumed in legislating on
a> subjects directly or indirectly connected
r. with the public lands, thereby prolonging
the sessions proportionately, and adding to
in the expense upwards of 8203.000 annualic
iy? Is it no evil that the Government
<>f should own half the lands within the limits
'r of nine members of this Union, and over
** which they can exercise no authority or
jjt control? Is it nothing that the domain
n, of so many States should bo under the
e. exclusive legislation and guardianship of
'i' tins Government, contrary to the genius
!l* of the Constitution, which, intending to
1,1 leave to each State the regulation of its
n local and peculiar concerns, delegated to
__ the Union those only in which all had a
,d common interest. If to all these be ad- j
ye ded the vast amount of patronage exer- j
cised bv this Gover.im oit through the
*G medium of the public lands, over the new
^ States, a id through thein, over the whole
"t Union, and the pernicious influence j
thereby brought to bear on all other subjo
jects of legislation, can it be denied that j
many and great evils result from the sys-1
k iem as it now operates, which call alouJ I
jj* for some speedy and efficient remedy ! j
But why should I look beyond fiieques- ;
tion before us to prove, by the confession !
3|j of all, that there is some deep disorder iu 1
be the system? There are now three meaav
sures before the Senate, each p.opuiiig !
,ls important changes, and trie one, or the
fe receiving the support of every m imberof
_ the body ; even of tho*e who cry out
against changes. It is too late, then, to
jor deny the disordered slate of the system,
be The disease is admitted, and the only
c- question, is, what remedy shal1 be applied.
)1S I object both to the bill, and the amendmt-nt
proposed by the Senator from Kentucky,
[Mr. Crittendkn[ because, regarded
as remedial measures, they are
both inappropriate and inadequatg. Neither
pre-emption, nor distribution of the
revenue, received from the public lands,
can have any possible effect in correcting
a. the disordered action of the system. I
Gf put the question, would one or the other
n, contribute in the smallest degree to dia
minish the patronage of the Government,
cr or the time consumed on questions growing
out of the public lands, or shorten the
s, duration of the sessions, or withdraw ine
ns action of the Government over so large a
js part of the domain of the new States, and
ne place them and their representatives here,
a_ on the same indepcndant footing with the
|je old States and their representatives, or
,y arrest the angry and agitating discusnons
which year after year distract our councils
!S, and threaten so much mischief to the
0p country ? Far otherwise would be the
effect. It would but increase the evil,
n by bringing into more decided con&ct,
nt the interests of the new and old States.
rs< Ofall the i!M that could befall them, the
j former would regard the distribution
>Cm as the greatest, while the latter would
i)t, look on the pre-emption system, proposed
| by the bill, as little short of an open sys.

:,g | declarations which wo have f^eard in the

liberate and careful examination, and have
come to the conclusion that there is, and
coo be, no remedy short of cession?cession
to the Spates respectively within
which the lands are situated. The discase
lies in ownership and administration ;
an d noibiog abort of parting with both can
reach it. Part with them, and you will
at once take away one-third of the business
of Congress ; shorten its sessions in
the same proportion, with a corresponding
saving of expense ; lop off a large a id
iiiost dangerous portion of the patronage
of the Government; arrest those ang-y
and agitating discussions, which do so
much to alienate the good feelings of the
differeot portions of the Union, and disturb
the general course of legislation, an J
endanger ultimately the loss of the public
domain. Rtain them, and thjy must
continue, almost without mitigation apply
what palliatives you may. It is the allsufficient
and only remedy.
Thus far would seem clear. I do not
see how it is possible for any ono to doubt
that cession Would roach the evil, and that
it is the only remedy that would. If then,
there should be any objection, it can only
he to the terras or conditions of the cession.
If these cau be so adjusted as to
give assurance that the lauds shall be a9
faithfully managed by the States as by
this Govcrnmeut, and that all the interests

than under the existing system, all that
could be desired would be effected, and
all objections removed to tho final and
quiet settlement of this great, vexed, aud
dangerous question. In saying.aU objections,
I hold that the right of disposing of
them as proposed, especially when demanded
by high considerations of policy, and
when it can be done without pecuniary
loss to the Government as i shall hereaf.
tor show, cannot be fairly denied. The
Constitution gives to Congress the unlimited
right of disposing of the public domain
and of course, without any other restrictions
(ban what the nature of that trust and
terms of cession may impose, neither of
which forbid their cession in tho manner
proposed.
Tnat the conditions can be so adjusted,
I cannot doubt. I have carefally examined
the whole ground, and can perceive
no difficulty that cannot be surmounted,
i feel assured that all which is wanting is
to attract the attention of the Senate to
the vast importance of doing something
that will effectually arrest the great and
growing evil, resulting from the appliestion
of the system, as it exists, to that portion
of the public domain lying in tho
new States. Tnat done, the int. lligence
and wisdom of the body will be at no loss to
adjust the details in such manner as will
effectually guard every interest, and secure
its steady and faithfuluiauagement.
In the mean time, I have adopted the
provisions of the bill introduced originally
by myself, and twice reported on favorably
by the Committee on Public Lands,
as the amendment I intend to offer to the
amendment of the Senator from Keatucky

and the Union, and great benefit to those

greatly improved; for which I rely on the
intelligence of the body, and critical examination
of the committee, should the
amendment be adopted aud referred. At
