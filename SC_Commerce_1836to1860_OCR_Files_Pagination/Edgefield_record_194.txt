Caplure of more than 500 Indians con
firmed.--By the arrival yesterday after
noon of the steamer James Adams, Capt.
Chase, from Black Creek, and through tile
attention of Captain C., we have received
from a correspondent the following intelli

('o the Editor of the Georgian:
BLACK CREEK. (E. F.) April 4.
I forward you a copy of Brig. Gen. Nei
-son's official report. You may rely upon
the following as facts. . Gen. Jesup had ar
ranged with the chiefs of tihe camp near
Jupiter, to meet him in council on the 20th
lilt. but they failed to attend, and from the
driving in of ponies and other indications,
lie believed they were preparing to fly from
the swamps.
The General determined that they should
not escape, and ordered Col.D. E. Twiggs
of the 2d dragoons to secure them. The
Colonel arranged matters so admirably
that he succeeded in taking every individ
unIon the morning of the 41st.
There were upwards-of500 men, women
and children, and among them over one
hundred and fifty warriors. In addition to
these there were taken 150 negroes, about
forty of whom are capable of hearing arms.
So you perceive that Gen. J.'s operations
in the vicinity of Jupiter Inlet have resulted
in securing upwards of 600 prisoners, and
silencing near 200 rifles,
General Jesup was up to the 27th ult.
busily employed in disposing of his prison
ers, as he was anxious to ush south, in or
der to join Col. Bankhead, who was in full
P pursuit of Sam Jones, and with some pros
pect of overtaking him. The General has
- ndmirably manuged the whole business.
T1he force of the enemy is broken and dis
pirited, and all hands agree that he has done
all that man could do, under tihe same cir
cumstance."
Extract of a letter, dated
"FORT JUPITR, March 27.
I dare say you have heard of our late
grah of 500 Indians, which, including ne
groes, make upwards of 600 prisoners that
time General has shipped for the west since
the Tocha-hatchie affair. IIaileck-hadjo,
and several other warriors have gone out tn
bring in some more of their people, and as
this su chicf is a young nan, I believe lie
will be bsefuml to us.

Camp Salemas, near Charles' Ferrv,
March 11th, 1838.
Brig. Gen. ARMISTEAD:
Sir-In obedience to orders, I took up
the line of march from my camp, left bank
of the Suwaunee 'river, opposite fort Fanl
ning, on time morning of the 4th instant, for
Deadman's Bay. On the morning of the
7th, after thoroughly scouring the intermne
diate country, and encounterng much wa
ter, produced by the recent heavy ruins, I
reached the Steamhatchee river, within six
miles of the bay, that stream inundating
the country for a considerable extent. I
deenied it improvident to pass without
further apparent necessity. I turned down
that streamn for some two miles, when the
country became too soft and wet to pass
further, when I directed my course up, and
as near that stream as I could, by way o(
its sources to this place, which I reached
this morning, examining critically every
point calculated to harbor the endmny, with
out finding the least trace of one made for
qponi ix, except thome six or eight who cross
ed the Suwannee at Clay landing in Jann
ary last, and committed those murders in
Middle Florida which have caused so much
excitement.
I must here be permitted to say that I
was not aivare of time apprehended dangei
by tihe citizenms of that section, until I met
you oti time Suwannee, 1st of March. It
is true that I discovered itt a few days after
thme murders were committed, where the
indians had crossed amid re-crossod, and~
deemned pursutit except to their retreat frumit
less, and I will add that I do not believe
that anmy of the enemy have beeni west of
the Suwanmnee this year, unless there be a
- few now constanitly on mime coast. Howev
er, whether I have or not discharged the
duty assigned me by General Jesup, that oh
p~rotecting the frontier, I feel conscious o1
- hving mnade faithful efforts, it is true th ai
I mighmt have establishmea posts, garrisomned
my troops, and waited the approach of thec
enemy, but I preferred to meet him in his
- fastnesses, and destroy or capture him whienm
found. Although I hrave been unlucky imi
profitable results,..yet the accotmpanyimng
mnemoranidums, furnished by my qutarter.
master, Major Rogers, will show time numn
her of miles we have marched, and it nmust
be borne in mind that lie furnishes tihe
marches amid couniter marches of thme trainis
with the commamid without anty regard to
the detailed duity of the command whmen
with the trains, after leaving a bare guard
for the day and the command joininig at
night. The variotus reports mad~e from
time to time will sustain the memorandums
his account being 1080 miles. If we add
only one-fourth fur the scours, wvhichi is
much too small, that part of my commandi
immedliately with my presenc, since the
19th Decetmber, 82 days, have marched andi
countermarched 1350, or 16 miles per day,
including rest days; built two pickets, forti
Baker amid Jennings, bridged Withilacoo

numerous other small streams, opened roads
&c. all of which sh~ow. I hope, that I have
not been idle.

WASHINGTON, April 7.
The Senate did not set to-day. They
passed the Duelling Bill to a third reading
last evening, by a decisive majority. Tihe
bill, as finally modified, provides that any
person engaged in a duel, as principal, or
second or friend, shall be imprisoned in the
Penitentiary not more than ten, nor less
than five years, at the discretion of the
Court. The amendment offered by Mr.
Clayton, to add to the penalty disqualifica
tion to hold office under the Government,
was rejected.
In the House, to-day, after some unim
portant morning business, Mr. lamer bro't
to the view of the House, the following re
solution, which was ordered to be printed:
Considering that the business, commerce,
circulation and exchanges of the country,
are in a deranged and embarrassed con-li
tion, and considering also that a part of the
Banks of the United States have express
ed a desire to resume payment at an early
day,
Resolved, by the Senate and House ol
Representatives of the United Sit\tes ol
America in Congress assembled, That il
the Banks, or a portion of them do thus
resume, it will be the duty of the General
Governient, within the limits of its con
stitutional authority, to aid such Banks (as
the present Administration design to do,) it
regaining public confidence, and to sustaic
them in their laudable efirts to fulfil theii
obligations to relieve the wants of the counn
try, and to restore to the public a sounl
circulating medium.
Mr. tlamer gave notice that lie wofll call
for the consideration of the Resolution or
Mondav next.
As Mr. flamer is a leading member ol
the Administration party, and a member o
the committee on Ways and Means, thit
movement may be considered as having fh<
sanction of the Administration. There i
no doubt that it will Le fivorably receivemi
by the House. The public, however, wouli
be very glad to know by wimt course o
measures the "present Administration'de.
signs" to aid the Banks. It does not ap
pear either, whetn or how, they came t<
the "design," which is thus officially an.
nounced.
The Resolution to divorce the Govern
ment from the public press, by prohibitin;
any Government printing fron being givet
to an editor of a newspaper, was, for a shor
time, discussed.
The House then went into Committee o
the Whole ott tihe Bill to establish a Boar<
of Commissioners, fot the adjustment an
final settlement of certain claims against th
Government.

The news which we give this week frotm
Florida is of the most painful interest. Tih
niurder which we have recorded, is associatei
in our mindis with all that is dark, and cruel am
terrible in savage warfare. Mrs. Puirifoy wa
born in this District, and removed but a few
years ago, fromn this Village, with her highly et
teeied father, to Florida. We knew her-well
and we speak but the langunge of her nmunerou
acquaintance when we say, that she displived ii
her life a huab-like meekness, a purity aid ex
cellence of character, which ire seldom seen.

to us on hearimg the ielimcholy occurrenctr
that the mild and innocent, the amiable an

[FOR THE ADVEtiTISER.1
Mr. Editor-A clever writer over tie sig
nature of "Unique,'' has appeared several
times in your paper, and in candor I must
say that I have poured over the productions
of his pen, with one exception, witlh no lit
tle pleasure. Tihe exceptionable article to
which I allude is to be found in your 8th
No. of thisyear. "The deep interest which
he feels in the welfare of the younger part
of your male readers will, he doubts not, be
a sufficient excuse for his presuming to di
rect them in the procurement of their bet
ter halves." Now, sir, I rejoiced when
"Unique" took the text which I have given
you in his own words, for I expected that a
writer of his proved ability, and seeming
ingenuousness, would have made something
out of it Sorry am I to say that I have
been disappointed. I make no war upon
his motive, and would be indeed mortified,
should he receive the impression, that in
the strictures which I propose making upon
his essay, I aml actuated by any other de
sire than that of vindicating my own sex
from what (in all deference) I consider the
nanny caltmnics which he has uttered.
ile pays no very high complement to his
own sex when lie says, "never pay your
devotions to a lady in the neighborhood or
village of your nativity or residence, for
rest assured that she will know too much a
bout you to find you at agreeable lover.
Now according to this, to love a gentleman
you must not know him; and theconverse,
I suppose is true, that to hate all gentlemen,
it is but necessary to be acquainted with
them. But ny business is not to defend
the stronger sex; "the blood of Douglass
can defend itself."
lIe does but justice when he dissents from
the opinion entertained by some, that a lady
is to be won by afew scraps of poetry.
Though not apprormng altogether, it would
have given me pleasure to have heard "U
nique" speak im terms of strong and un
qualified reprehension of Byron, whose
character as a poet is only surpiassed by his
character as a rake, and who, whatever may
ie the sublimity of his genius, by the ver
dict of the world should never be mention
ed in connection with any thing that is vir
tuous and excellent. Better would I be
pleased if his opinions were never even in
troduced on such subjects. ly the acknow
ledged and notorions turpitude of his life, lie
has forfeited all claims to notice, and, to
sny the least, it is bad taste to speak of
him as respectable authority.
r The next writer introduced by "Unique"
is the Duke Rochefoucauld. 7t seems to
have been the Duke's notion, that one had
nothiug to do but to fill a woman to over
flowing with jlattery, to winl her. Our zeal
will not lead us amto the denunciation of an
eminent man, whose life was consecrated
to the noble purpose of benevolence, and
of promoting the useful arts, but we must
be permitted to regard his notions as the
idle vagary of one who knew nothing of
whiat he was writing about. "Unique"
clearly insinuates that the )uke has given
the true philosophy of woman. and lie pro
ceeds in his article to inform his readera
how to carry it out. The difficulty here
tofore has been in its practical application
I "The poet, the philosopher, the moralist
i have all attempted to furnish a chart anid
colpass, but they have all failed." All
these mighty difficulties have now vanished,
and this greater than poet, philosopher or
moralisthas discovered tihe truesecret.
"Strike the cymbal, rolltihimbrel,
a Let the trumip of triumph sound."
Arid pray what is this brilliant discovery?
- Credit with his tailor, and six uninterrupt
- ed interviews with his mistress." "Never
talk to a woman about any thing but her
self." It is at age of patents, and I would
suggest to "Unique" to secure the right for
thus gettmg a wde.

Flour.-The first quiarter of the year 1838
having recently expired, we have referred to the
returns imade tiny the Inspector Uceral to tihe
City Registerland find that during the three
moniths endiiig 31st March just past, there were
inlspiecnted 80,889 barrels and 300 half barrels
Wheat Flour. Compared with tihe inspectiollns
of tihe correspoiding <puarter of 18:t7, those of'
die quarter just fiimshed show a falling oil' of
14,139 bbhs. Wheat Flour.
Te falling off in tie supplies of Foreign
Vheat. daring tle quarter just fiunished, when
coipared with tihe samie quarter of last year, is
materially greater. In the month of Jan. 18;7,
there were inported 12:,320 bushels of' wheat;
in Februaryfd,*279 hushels; and in March,226,
609 hushel's-nmaking an ageregate ilrort ,r
the firstquarter of'1837, of425A,2118bushels. The
imports during the sane itonths of 1838 form an
aggregate of about 215,000 bushels, nead conse
queitly show a falling ol of 213,208 bushels.
E'mtimating the wheat at the rate of 5 bumshels
to tihe barrel of flour, the fhlling off inl the wheat
inimport of the last three nonths is equivalent to
42,641 barrels of flour; and if to this we add the
falling off ill tie inspections. n1 shown above,
we find that the aggregate fidling off, in flour
and wheat, is equivalent to 55.780m bhis. of flour.
From present appearances there is little doubt,
we think, that the imports of Ijoretn wheat
during the present quarter will be imo larger than
those of that just finished.
Thel Stocks of Flour in the laltimlore market
at this time, from the best information we have
been able to obtain. we think may be set down
at 30,000 to 35,000 barrels of all descriptions.
The quarter's inspections of Flour at Rich
mond endinr 31st March, 1838, were 41,056
barrels. 1)uritmg th! qiarterending a1st March,
1837, tijere were 37,870 barrels. Showing an
increase 3186 barrels.
At Alexandrin. the quarter's inspection ending
31st Iiiclh, 1838. were 4307 barrels. F'or tie
qua.rer ending 31st March -1837, there were
9,895 bbl. showing a falling off of 5,588 bbls.

2dly. Of Bilions Fever. This is a more obsti
tate and dangerous disease than intermittent or
tgue and fever, there are generally three or four
lays indisposition previous to the onset of thid
lisease, and frequently chilly sensations for a day
r two after. When this disease-is properly
ormed it rarely yields to any treatment under 8 or
0 days, and sometimes much longer.
3dly, Of Typhus or Nervous fever. This is
Itill a much -more obstinate and dangeroucdieaso
han bilious fever, and apparently more mild in I
lie connnoncement. It often continues fifneen
)r twenty days with scarcely any remission or in
ermission, with great prostration of body and
lepression of mind. It may be well to observe
hat Typhus fever is most common in time winter
mdspring, and Billious fever in the summer and
all. In the first stage of all fevers, it is common
For the tongue to be covered with a whitish coat,
and if the fever is not broken and rum into the
;econd stage, it is apt to assume a yellowish
brown color, and in the third and last stage of
revers, (and articularly if they are of a high
grade and malignant character) the tongue is apt
to assume a dark brown color, of different degrees
f moisture; sometimes it is exceedingly dry; inl
Ni stage of the disease the patient is often sen
4ible ora hot or burning sensation in the stomach.
rhe symptomis of there two diseases are'so much
ilike in their first stage dint plysicians often dif
rer as to their real character, nor does it matter
materially, because the treatment of both should
be pretty much the sine, with this exception,
that typhuss fever does not require nor will it
bear as much strong sickening imedicine as bil
ious fever.
Treamnent In the first stage of tho two last
diseases, I give a puke or one or two small doses
of culomel or sone other anedicine that will ope
rate upon tie stomach and howels. Under any
circumstances I object to giving more stroig
medicite, and man decidedly of opinion that re
peated doses of such operating medicines do
more harm than good. After thus operating oin
the stomach and howels (und even without it)
if several days have elapsed and my patient be
come weak, I commence with the pills aid drops,
and give t (lose every three hours, that is eight
doses in each twenty four hours, with a regular
use of Virginia snake-root, orsone other sweat
ing tea. sich ashysi p, sage or bahn. S hmulg
tihe patient suffer niuc i with pain in the head.
back or elsewhere, give twenty or twenty-five
drops of laudanm at night, if itle a grown per
son (children should take less corresponding With
theirages) and should lie become imuch debilita
ted from a continuation of the disease, and par
ticilarly if the hands and feet become cold, give
a draught of toddy or wine every three or four
hours unitil lie recovers; continue all tihe time to
use the pills or drops as reconunended. The
diet should be light, and taken only a little at a
time nnd often.
Bleeding is so seldom required in these disea
ses that it is scarcely necessary to mtiention it; if
it ever is resorted to it should be in die early
stage of them.
Blistering is sometimes useful and rarely if ev
er injurious; hut it should be chiefly resorted to
in the last stage,when there is delirium or lasting
coldiness in the extremities. In die trentnmcnt of
either of these diseases, I would prefer die bow
ei6 to be in rather a costive than laxative cnndi
tion. But should the howels be too inative,
give broken doses oh salts or oil, or ope hein
Witlh injections, and if they should be two laxa
tive, give six or eight drops of laudanumn two,
three or four times a day, until the loosiess is
restrained. ify experience in the treatment of
yellow fever has not been very extensive, bit it
Is neither anore nor less dan tihe highest grade of
bilious fever, and should be treated pretty much

Having travelled imuch over the states, both

Imy certify, that I believe there has neveryet been

parted. I have kniowinimany labiouring nnder fe

knmownt it used, it has never tailed to effect a cure,
so fori as kniown to nie, in a shorter timie thani any
