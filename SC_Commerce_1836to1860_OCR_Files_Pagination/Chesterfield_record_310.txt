"In the third place, as a iirge share of

cannot sufficiently recomtn aid to your notice
what may bo called the economy o>

this art successfully, your ow.i interest may
not only ho promoted, but a'so the welfare
and comfort of the 1 .borers in your service
matrridly increased. Servants wit!i all
their imjierfeciions, (and God knows no
human being is altogether perfect) are rare,
ly so bad as represented ; and in many in.
stances their defec iv? conduct may be imputed,
in sum* measure, to the master himself,
in so fir as he neglects to teach them
th<*ir duty,or behaves to them with roughness
or asper ?y. When you, George, become
a master, treat your servants wi h
kindness ; and i venture ?o say, that, almost
in every ins*nncc, a suitable return will b;
experienced. The be-t servant nriy fall
* into error a: a time ; iut when one of this
character happens to make an unintentional
mistake, rather wink at the fault, than
r< prchend it in the manner too customary
with many p niple. Depend upon it, more
j?J may be done in this way, than by
adopting a con'rary conduct, mat is, if the
servant is gifted w.th the slightest nortion
of sense and discernment. Tho thought*

GEORGIA.
We extract the following passages from
the message of Gov. Gdmer to the Legislature
of Georgia now in session.
GEOLOGICAL SURVEY.
The appropriation of tea thousand dollars
for a geological Survey of the Stat**,
will be expended before the cad of the present
. year. It wiit be necessary that nn nddilione!
appropriation shall be made, if it is
the purpose of the Legislature to continue
the opera1 ions of the Geologist, until an
entire survey of the State shall be completed.
The buiidin? which is now being emc.
ted fur fi Lunatic Asylum, will be comple
led before your next session, and ready for
the reception of tire insane. I would call
the attention of tho Legislature to the n^cessity
of prescribing the rules upon which
i s inmates shall bo received, adopting prop,
er regulations for the government of the
Institu'ion, appoin ing a Doard of Trustees
for its superintendence and inspection, and
a Physician for its Medical direction.
There are at present one hundred and
sixty convicts in the Penitentiary. This
number is too large to bo e.mployed within
the present building, or to admit of the convicts
being subjected to solitary confinement,
the number of cells now erected being
only ou? hundred and fifty.
The Bounty *>n Silk.
* u .r it . ? !
i woutu rcspecuuuy recommend the repeal
or modification of the law passed at
your last session, to promote the culture of
silk. From enquiries made by 'his Department,
it has been ascertained that the pr?mium
of fifty cents off-red by that law for
?ucv, pound of silk cocoons raised in the
S ate, .s iwrreo Kvim tf)e(r value ; so
that the producers, receiving premium,
will receive certainly twice the value for
cocoons, and throe tirn^ if they can find a
market for them. The extended plantings
of the morus multicauhs mulberry tree,
winch I?1 already been made in this Statu ;
the facility wi.h which it can be rapidly propagated
; its quick growth and c4Ply fitness
for fending t ie silk worm and tip; ease
with witich any quantity of the silk worms
may be obtained; render it highly proba.
hie that a sufficient quantity of silk cocoons
will be ra sed, en i led to premiums, to ox
can 1)3 hut little doubt that this will be the
case, ii'our climate, soil, and chenp lands,
admit of t!i? application of labour to die
cultivation of the mulberry ;rec, and raising
silk cocoons, so as to derive thercJrom the
ordinary profits received fiom other < n?plo\ments.
If not, then u!l the premiums
j which shall have been paid, will be so
j much public money thrown away. As the
law gives an implied pledge that tlie premium
shall bo paid for ten years, regard for
the public f >iih. as well as the public interest
r- quires that if it is to be repealed or mo li- I
fjcil within the ten years, it be done at once.!
1 and b fore verv extensive obligations shall j
j have been incurred to our citiz'ms under it,
or large amounts of the public money paid
away.
Besides hese objections to the particular
provisions of the l.iw, the policy in whirh it
is founded is itseif very questionable. The
people of ibis country arc so keenly a'tivc
to their own interests; so li.tlc under the
influence of long continued usages ; and
change from on'- employment to another so
readily ; that the intcifen nce of the Gov.
eminent in giving a forced direction to their
labour by bounties, can scarcely be justified
in ntiy instance whatever. As the raising
of silk cocoons requires neither etftraordi
nrtrv camtal nor skill ; has been known to
v ?r
ho pooplo of this- S ue from its first colonial
settlement: is designed to supply the demands
of luxury and not of nec ssi y ; and
therefore only encouraged by thy Su e to
enlarge the sources of profit; there is no
stronger inducement for its encouragement
by bounty, than any other production which
ilie Legisla'ure may be of the opinion can
be ra sed with advantage.
Iftiie Legislature should bo of tiro cpinI
ion, however, that the law is found- d in
] Sound policy, and ought to bo continued in
force, I would recommend that it bo so
m id.fi? d, as to takeoff the bounty now allowed
upon s lk cocoons, and increase that
allowed upon silk, and especially upon raw
Professor, Fornrm, of the Washing on
or reeled silk. Frauds are so easily com
rnitted in weigh ng cocoons ihatjJiny
noi be prevented. There;s brts:?!cs no ob.
ject to be effected by encouraging the raiding
of cocoons at present, as there is no
sufficient market fur their sale in the Uui'cJ
States, and because they canno* bo sen:
abroad on account or iheir great bulk in
proportion to their value ; the injury done
to them by Compression ; and tlr ir liability
to decay when exposed to the damp
of the ocean. Raw silk, on the contrary,
finds a ready market to any amount
in England or France, and is so light in proport
on to its value, as to-b?; set.t abroad at
very little expense. If silk is to be undo in
this State in sufficient quan'iiirs to become
one of its staple productions, it will most
J urohably be fa the form of raw silk, and
I therefore, encouragement should be given
:o i: in ihat form, if at oil.
Maine and Georuia.
! regret to nform vou tint the Legislature
of the Stat^ of Maine has declined ink.
ing any measures to give satisfaction to t'?is
State, for the violation of its constitu ion.il
rights, by the refusal of Governor Dunlap
and Governor K'-nt to deliver up to its authorities
upon their demand tie* fugitives
from its justice, Philbrook and K< llerao.?
You will perceive from the proceeding? of
the Legislature of Mai..e, at i's Inst session,
that upon reference to it of all the documents
in relation to Philbrook and Kellemn,
it contented itself by resolving that the
whole of that subject was exclusively within
the province of the Executive Department,
and that it was inexpedient for the Legislature
to take any order in relation thereto,
! notwithstanding that the Ivgisla'tire had
j passed a law at its previous session, defining
tne power of the Executive D partmcnt
in arresting and delivering up fugitives from
justice, from oilier Snes, and evidently
with die view of justifying Gov. Dunlnp in
his previous refusal to deliver up PiiN
brook and Kelleran to the authorities of th;s
Stat'*,
Tlds conduct of the Legislature of Maine
and the previous conduct of Governor Dunlap
and Governor Kent, prove conclusively
that the opposition to llie in titution of slavery
is so great .among the people of that
State, thai their public nurh<.riiies nri prevented
from obeying the injunc ioris of the
Cci.stitu.iau of the United States, win n required
to deliver up fugitives Horn justice
charged with the crime of violating the
rights of property in slaves. This Sfa
must therefore protect by its own authority,
the rights of its citizens in slaw property
against this disposition of Maine, to violate
them. For this purpose you will be justified
in declaring by lawt that uii oiiiz<-ns of
Maine who may come within the jurisdiction
of tii s State, on board of any vessel ;?s
owners, oflirirrv or mariners, shall he roil
side red as doing so wit!) the intent to romniit
the crime of seducing negro slaves
irom their owners, and bo dealt wi ll accordingly
by the officers of justice.
I have not called a convt n'iori of the J
people of the State to take into coasidt ration I
'he course they ought to purs'-T in maint doing
their rights in consequence of die refusal
of Maine to do them justice, as directed
by the resolutions of the L"g slature, passed
.at its session of 1837, for the reason, ilia'
he Legislntuio failed to provide for the ex- i
pensesofsuch a Convention,and hatiusea i
