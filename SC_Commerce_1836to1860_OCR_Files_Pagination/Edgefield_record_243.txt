INVESTIGATING COMM1ITTEE.
PART I.-THE ' D1 FALCATIONS OF MR
SWARTWOUT.
1. The extent of Mr. swartwout's Defal
. cations.
Conclusions of the Committee
1st, That Mr. Swartwout isa defaulter
to Government, as appears by his own re
turns, as adjusted from time to time at the
Treasury Department. in the sum of one
million two hundred and twenty-five thou
sand seven hundred and five dollars. and
sixty-nine cents.
2d. That this amount of indebtedness
has accumulated upon the face of the quar
terly accounts, regularly returned by him
for adjustment at the Treasury Depart
ment, without the omission of any of ei:h
er items, debit or credit, thereon, until it
became ;in absolute defalcation.
2. The duration of Mr. Swartwout's De
. falcations.
Conclusions of the Committee.
1st. That all moneys received by Mr.
Swartwout as collector prior to 1837,
were regularly accounted for by hin in his
quarterly returns to the Treasury Depart
ment.
2.. That so much of all moneys receiv
ed by Mr. Swartwout prior to 1837, and
accounted for to the Treasury Detariment
in his quarterly returns, as were not paid
by him into the Treasury. were returned
by him under the tacit acquiescence of the
accounting officers of the Treasury; and
regularly carried forward, debited to hitim
self, in the balance of each subsequent
quarterly account rendered by him to the
Treasury Department, to the close of the
term of his ofice.- -
3d That his omission to carry a debit
to himself of the noneys received by him
from the Treasury, or from other-4ources,
prior io 1837, to the close of accounts kept
only at the custom house, called his cash
accounts, and his carrying a debit to him
self or any such it ems to any ot her class of
accounts kept only at the custom house,
called suspense and :nsettled accounts, or
by any other name, would not operate as
a concealment, innocent or fraudulent
from t he Treasury Department. of the trite
cash balance in his hands. First, because
neither his cash account, nor his suspended
and unsettled account, nor any other sub
on~liuate neenuint, Lore t - dt- tawini
house. was ever exhibited to. or fornied the
basis ofany quarterly wttlemeut made by
him with the accounting offmeers of the
Treasurv. Secondly. because in his quan
terly accounis settled at the Treasury De
parmivent, the aegregate and true balance
ofoall subordinate nccounta kept at the cus
ton-house, includina both his cash ac
count and suspense account, was unifortm
ly, prior to 1837, carriedt into his quarter
lv account under the item of "cash and un
settled accounts."
4th. That the defalcations of Mr. Swart
wout, by means of fraud and false returns,
commenced in 1837. and not-sooner, and
have existed since that period; and the
defalcations thus accruing, added to the
moneys previously retained by him, ac
cording to his returns -to the Treasury De
partment, and by the silent acquiescence
of the officers of that Department until the
close of his term of-oce, cons, tute the
aat.regate of his defalcations at the present
period.
3. The causes of Mr. Steartwout's Defal
cations.
CAUSE 1. The irresponsibility of Mr.
Swartwoui in pecuniary character, at the
time of his atppointment to office.
Conclusions of thee Committee.
1st. That at the timn' of' Mr. Swvart
Iwont's annointtment. andl of his teapp~loint
ment to office, he was wholly irresponisible
in pecunhtry reputation, and wtas involved
in dlebt.
2.1. That at the time of his appointment
and reappointment, and for the whole pe
riod he w'as ini office, lie was notoriously
encaged in larije andI hazardous speculai
tions, anti deeply embarrassed by them.
3d. That his pecnniary responsibility
and consequent involvements by hazar
dous speculations, constitute one of the
primary causes of bis defalcat ions to the
Government.
CAUSE 2. Culpable disregard of law,
and neglect of otficial duty, by the late na
val officer at New York.
Conclusions of the Committee.
1st. That the late naval offier at the
port of New York throughout the term of
his service, fromt 1829 to 1838, wholly dis
regarded the requirements qflaw prescri
hing-the duties of his offee.
2d. That the said naval oficeer for the
same period, wholly disregarded the in.
structious of the Comptroller of the Tr-eas
urv of November'10. 1821..
3d. Thnat sail naval officer, by so dis
regarding the requairemente' oflawv and the
instructions of the Treasury Department,
culpably neglectedl to keep the accounts,
andrecor-ds appertatining to his office, atnd
therebi rendering the office nugatory as a
check on the accounts of the collector.
4th. That if the duties ofrsuid naval of
fic-er, se authorized and directed by exist
itng laws, bad been e-xecutedl with'proper
care and vigilance, they would have ren
dered it impracticable for any fraud or er
ror in any of the accounts of the collector
of said port, to escape immediate detec
tion.
5th. That the culpable disregard of the
plaitn requirements of law and of Treasury
instnrucinns prescrihing the dties of naval
officers. fly said naval officer, anti his con
tinued neglect of official duty, i,4 a prima
cause of the immense defalcations o1
the late collector of New York.
CAUSE 3. Culpable disregard of law anl
neglect of official duty, by the Pirst Audi
tor of the Treasury.
Conclusions of the Committee.
1st. That the first \nditor of the Treas.
ury has been guilty ofculpablo disregari
of law, and neglect nfduty, in examining
and certifvmug the correctness of the ac
counts of the late collector at New York,
without having compared them thorough
ly with the vouchers accompanyine thv
saei; and also in transomitting -,aid ac
counts to the first Comptroller. cerified
for revision, while the most importani
vouchers therefor were retained in his owc
office.
2d. That no fraud practised by the said
collector in his weekly returns of cash tt
the Secretary oftle Trreasttry, could afrec1
the true and just settlement of the account
of said collector at the Auditor's office, at
said weekly returns form no part of the ha
sis of the settlement of said quarterly ac
counts by the auditor; and tlerefore fur.
nish no apology for the neglect of the Au
ditor to exatine the sate thoroughly.
3d. That without the aid of the register
of bowl accomtts of collectors, required
by law antid Treasury circular to be kepi
i-y the Auditor, to enable hin to deteci
frauds and defalcations, if any exist, the
said Auditor could have thoroughly exam
ined said Swartwout's quarterly accottut
during any quarter said Ali-litor has beet
in offmce. inasmuch as the original quarter
ly accouote were retained, against law. i
his office, and furnished the same means o
comparison as a register would have fur.
nished.
4tb. That, in the culpable disregard o
law and negect of duty. as aforesaid, by
said Auditor, is frond a primary cause
why the defalcations of said Swartwout it
1837, and subsequently, escaped every de
rection, and have resulted in the probablh
loss of the public treasure.
CAUSE 4. Culpable disre'ard of lay
and neglect of duty by the late and pres
ent Comptrollers of the Treasury.
Conclusions of the Committee.
1st. That the late Comptroller of thf

of collectors filed in his office, and the re
cords thereof required by law, and in set

accounts of Samuel Swartwout, late col

the vouchers therefor required by positivi
injunctions of law.
3d. That said Comptroller is also guilt,
of culpable disregard of hw and.negieet 0
duty-1st. In not having sought and as
certained from the "invoicesand appraie
ments" at the custom-house, either t brougl
the Solicitor of the Treasury or otherwise

counts still rtnain unsettied, utntil the
jonth of Novemtber, when the deteetiot
of Swartwout's larger deltcation wa
cotntunicated from Ne'w York.
4th. Trhat the adtninistration of it it
marked with such si nal ineficeieney, a:
well as neglect of duty, as render ougato
ry many of th - mort important checks up)
ona the First Auditor, and collectors, re
ceivers, anti disbursers of thet. putblic mo
neys, which the laws creamitir and regu.
lating its duties contemplated and htave
sufficienty provided.
5th. That mn said disregard of latw and
neglect of duty by tho said Comptrollers,
and inefficieacy of the office as now admin
istered, is to he found a'primary cause ol
the immense defalcatiotns of the late col
lector at the port of New York, and con.
sequent loss of the public tmoney,

ttry Departtment, charged by law with the
superintendence of the collection of the

Conclusions, of the Committee,
1st. That, of late years. importanm
hooks of records, designed to contaitn a
condensed statement of the accounts and
liabilities of collectors of customs, wveekly,
monthly, and quarterly, have been per.
mtitted to fall into disuse in the depart
ment of the Secretary of the Treasury,
andl thereby render nugatorv many of the
essential checks utpon defaleations of that
class of officers, arising. from existing lai
and Treasury regulations.
2d. The negligence and failure of the
Secretary of the Treasury to discharge his
duty, as the head of the Treasttry depart.
ment, charged by law with the superifiten.
dIenco of t he collection of the reventue, andi
his want of a correct appreciation of thme
before named records in the superinten
d ence'of the co'lect ion or the public reve
nues, and the conseqient neglect to con
tinue and complete them, are justly regar
dled as a primary cause of the escnpie from
detection, for so long a period, of the im.
inense defalcations of the late collector it
the port or New York.
31. That the Secretary of the Treasury
has been wanting in a proper discharze of
his duty in ollice, in pernit ting Samuel
Swariwont, late collector of New York,
quietly to retain the sum of$201.000 after

demnifying hinself agatinst claim< of im
portets for dtiies paid hin under protest.
and liable by him to be refunded, while it
was known to the Secretary of the Treas

and that the saie were being relunded,
from necessity, out of other acerning re
sources of the Government by said S wart
wout's suteessor itt office.

at preretnt he was willing to "foorget the past."
It was a remark fill of wisdom and patriosti.
He also desired to forhear an exatnation. or

hope that both the Givenor of klain--. and
New Brunswick. iighit panse. and tlat those
lwho had heet captured oat hath sides might be

ratlier an exlpre-sion of adesire, that ftngs night
take this direction, and th afliir lie termina
ted. than lonvig- it. as was sit.,poscd. to Nev
Braunswick, and Maine, to settle and ad lst it.
This waa lir P's. understanding of that part
of tt' message.
Dta the gentleman (%fr. Adains) had pro
notinced the message too pacific 'or hin. Now.
thei paeific tendency of it, (if it were)was to him
( . ).) its liliest recomnaendation. lie
tuonght it was dulie to tat' dligty of ithe mnat

gentlemnan was mistaken. Others had made
siamilar remarktis.
He (Mr. P.) earnestly desired that peace
might be preservedt; Ihe find no atotnbt it would
be. Imbecility and intdea'isiaon itowt, at this
jnnetare, woitdd britng war; bitt decisiona anid
firmaness would preserve peace and otur honior
too. As to the controv-ersy of' the past. Mr. P.
wouald desire to say bitt lit Ie; he would, how
ever, take this occasion to say that he hasd ex
amined it; anad, as to the question of the loca
tion of the traue line. itoder the treaty of 17t83.
there was not a jury of twelve meni, etn in
England. who, under oath, could refuse us a
verdict uapon the facts of the case; it was a
quaestiont too clear for coniroversy. Atad. as to
the pose-iasion ofthie partieniiar sectiotn ofe-conn
try where the conflict had taken place, it had
for thirty years beeon settled by our citizens, ann
der grants frota- Matstsachausetts. The tareten
sianna of excltnsive itnindiction set up by Great
liritain, arose from the ground that shte cotnsid
aired our sovereignty as comencing aonly
from the declaration of inleniendtence, or the
tre-aty of peace; and that, therefore, in all dis
pitted territory, she wouald exercise jurisdictiona
from Ite claimsi oaf prior saovereign~ty. This
Mr. P. considlered raither a fi -tion. The trea
ty of1j7AS wvas signed by ind'.petid,-nt egana's
He woutld Itere say, ini the past, Mfaint' land
been wroniged-.teeply wroned-by whom he
would not ntow say, hut he would say she bad
also wronged herself.
The gentleman from Massachusetts, (Mr.
Cushing) had alludedl to other points of difli
enilty betweet us,~ and Great Britain. and to one
in which thte South is vitally interested. Yes;
Mr. P. said he held in hit hand the corren pon
dence recently published betweent the British
Cabiniet, through Lord Patmerston, with ouar
Minister and Govonnment-, it related t en
vessel that had bee-n driven by,storm, upon the
coast of* Bermuda, with slves bi-te thlis section
of couatrv, destined for New Orleavs. and
woich haI been seized by the British authori
ties and liberated. L le e the Speaker intima
ted meat it was not in order. but Ai. P. said be
did i.ot intend io disiiss it.] N'he Briiish Cah
inct, in this cirrepondecnc , had taken the
ground distinctly, and so cotmnettiiieated to or
Uoveinmeni. 1ha. the' could not, nider any
circun-tances. recognise the riget of , p:erty
in persons. They iad c. 'ei;tltiity. in the

itively rel used i deinuity, bec I. :. apipened
after tieir act of emiatecipttion to the WVest in
dia Is.a ds.
Mr. P. had pernsed this correspi ndence
with the deepest iIIee:Dation. Tha' Gov--rn
tenit had by it so: up the right. to decide for
us. in what our prope' iy sioturd co ri .t. It
struck a high-iandt d blow at our indepen
dence. dut he would Iorhear to pursue the
subject, and oily say that, rather tia submit
to iU arroganet asslnumptions, lie would prefer to
see the couintry from the P'atapsco to the Sa
bine, laid low ine one sioking rum. This was
oinee aeiongst the many poil:is at istue between
its. and Great Britain. to which the getlenan
(Mr. Cishinig) had a.lided. The controversy
on the Northeassern beounday. wad presented a
tangible issue before us, and he thienght, tei
more decided the mnoveinei:s were, the better
fir th.- peace or tle two counitries. lie thought
the strong mi hIary movementsol Maine, if con
eldtc~cd vi:t judgmenm, won .d teid to preveIt
eonifict: tiat if oniv small niumber ei both
Sides. and erttally divided. were to mee:t, there
would be greater danger of coitlict of arms.
lie, therefore, dilflered with the gentieutn
from Massncehuseats. litrthest from him, (-i1r.

.avins in his call for a strong artned force.
[.3r. Litcoln said that ir. '. had miisinder
stood him: that he referred to the first move
ment to drive 1f1' tres' assers, and increly said
that that was a military movetieent ]
Mr P. was glhd to mider.tand this from tle
Lemntuane, and what le intended to advance
wag., that the mo-t decided mtovenents at this
mieire wiuld be in theeel the ittost peacea
hte. He deprecated any thing that might final
ly tend to war, between us, and (reat Beritaini;
fie hoped there would be ot) occas-on to make
that last sad appeal. Int if it was threed upon
us, lie wot:d pledge his till upon the conetest.
In this mitter, to a trai-sient observer. at first
sisht. .iini might seein to bmaone interest
ed bitt w:.- are all hound together inder s:acred
compact. we belonged to a cominmon co.i-der
acy, and had a conmmi couitry; antd although
I represet a r'itote section. yet the cause of

and Kentucky, which every gao-I citizent
ought to desire, and will prove to eohr
neighbors, that thee people of this State arte
always disposed to extened to Kentuicky
