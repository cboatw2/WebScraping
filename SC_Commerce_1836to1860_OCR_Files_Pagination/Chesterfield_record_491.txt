Appetites in Cold Climates.?In the
frozpn regions of the north, the appetite for
food, and the power of digestion, are commonly
excessive. Captain Coc.ran, in his account
of a journey, through Russia and Siberian
Tartary, gives some rimarkable illustrations
of this tact. Admiral Saritchef, states that a
Yaiikut informed him, that one of their men
was accustomed to consume at home in the
space of twenty-four hours, the hind quarter
of a large ox, twenty pounds of fat, and a proportion
ite quunity of molted butter tor bis
drink. The appearance of the 111 in not justifying
the assertion, the Admiral had a mind
to try his goruiaiu/.mg powers, and for this
purpose, he n id a tf* ck pordruig of rice boiled
down with three pounds of butter ; weighing
together twenty-eight pounds; and although
the glutton had a ready breakfasted, he sat
down to it with ihegrea est eagerness and consumed
the whole without leaving the spot.
Captain C. savs. I have rcp< atedly seen a
Yaiikut or a Tongouse devour forty pounds ot
meat i 1 a day; and I have seen three of ill'se
go tons consume a r. in deer at tine meal. He

TBWPKRANEE IN BALTIMORK.
Letter troni a v/iergynmn m uaiuiimi o
to the Secretary of the American Tcm.
pe ranee Union/
Batimork, Jan. 30th, 1841.
Dear Sir : The great a nd glorious Tcm
pcrance Reform, which has been progressing
in Baltimore for some months past,
is still exciting the attention of the public,
and advancing with unabated interest and
success. In my letter written to you in
December, 1 expressed the belief that before
a tirelvemonih from that time, the
44 Washington Temperance Society," (with
whom mainly this unusual excitement be.
gan) would number44 one thousand memr.
here" How little faith we soinetimts
have in the progress of truth! I have
the pleasure to inform you now that this
.society numbers more than one thousand,
all grown men, besides from Jive hundred
toa thousand men and youth, who have
joined its auxiliaries, established within
the last two months. The 44 Hoirard
Temperance Society J a society of recent
origin also, numbers, I think, over a thousand
members. And other Societies in
the city, to the number of about a dozen,
in all, formed within six months, contain
perhaps a thousand more. So that I think
1 am safe in saying that something like
three thousand five hundred persons have
signed the Total Abstinence Pledge in Baltimore
within a few months. This is independent
of any movements among the
Catholics, with whom there has been some
action, though not so vigorous as in Washington,
Philadelphia, N. York and elsewhere.
They can, I trust they will do
yet much more.
There have been, and are still, in this
moral revolution many cases of individual
reformation from intemperance. To
what extent I am not prepared to say.
The movement is not confined to any
class of the community, the Socicti. s being
composed of men of all ranks and occupations
in life. The blessings b.ought
upon the city are already pcr<$ivcd and
admitted by all. The Mayor In h '< last
Annual Message has made a favorable notice
of the influence of the Ten p ranee
reform, upon the peace, quiet and morals
of the city.
The friends of Temperance < < ntempla'c
having a Grand Cold Wafer Procssior
in Baltimore on the 5th of April next, the
anniversary of the formation of the Washington
Temperance Society. This Society
intend inviting all theTotal Abstinence
Societias of the city, and all the
cold watermen of 3/aryland and of the
whole country to attend and join in the
procession on that day. We would like
to see delegates from every State in the
Union. Indeed an Address to the friends
of Temperance in the United States may
be expected from the Washington Tern'
perance Society inviting them fr >m Maine
to Louisiana to be in Baltimore on the 5th
of April next.
From present indications! have no he!
sitation in expressing my belief that there
! will be from 5 000 to 8.000 persons, who
will march in the great procession on that
orv as:on. O i the same day it is expeci
ted that t ie Corner-stone rf a splendid
Temp ranee Hal will he laid in Baltimor ,
a Committee having already been appointed
by the Washington Society to make
arrangements in the way of purchasing a

of the 5th of \pril, the city is to be ilium!
mated ; an I it is expected that not only all
; the Temperance families in the citv, but
many others will participate in the illumination.
The ladies, always ready for
every pood work, are preparing banners
to be carried in the procession;?and I
ainsatisfi d it will be a grand affair ; and
pass off well.
Respectfully yours,
From the Pastor s Journal.
THE LITTLE INKLUKNCE OF DEATH LTO.N
SURVIVING FRIENDS.
As from the wing, no scar the sky retains,
The parted wave, no Turn.w from the kneel,
So dies in human hearts the thought ol
death."
It is not in affliction, however severe
or oft-repeated, to make the heart better,
but in the operations of the Spirit who.' c
; province it is, to perform this wonderful
work, by means of his own choosing. No
quantity of sorrow on account of the loss
of friends, will transform hi heart and
tit it for heaven. This is the office of
IIim who reproves sin, and takes the
| tilings of Christ, and reveals them to the
soul and ens'airips the blessed image of
Jesus there; and he will never give this
glorv to another.
Of the numbar of mourners, with whom
twentv.two venrs of pastoral experience
allows me to speak. I ran say that of those
who had previously givsn evidence of piety,
the effect has gen -rally been to enliven
ilie Christian graces, embitter, sin. render
world more empty, endear the Saviour,
and cherish the temper of the heavenly.
Some delightful illustrations are recollected
where the children of God have been
heard saving. ,4 It is good for me that 1
J ~ o
have been a/flirted." Fathers, mothers,
widows, orphans, have felt that God was
wise and faithful, and kind, and paternal,
in correcting them, and one like unto the
5>on of God has been walking with thein
in the furnace. Hut of those who were
impenitent, connected with the three hundred
and thirty families?most of which I
have visited rep atcdly in the attempt to
discharge pastoral duties?it is astound,
ing to me to think how few have given
any evidence of having been savingly
benefitted by their sorrows.
I can recall to memory but six affording
evidence, followed by a holy life, who
dated the commencement of their serious
impression to the providence of God in
chastening them. I have known manyothers
who have had their attention arrested,
their feet turned to the sanctuary,
who in the process of months or years, became
humble Christians, and they date
the incipient moment of tenderness tc
> i 11 _ i
those afflictions which brekctncir nom ca
the world, and let! them to the hearing oi
the world, and led them to the hearing ol
the Gospel and the study of the Bible;
but the affliction was rather the mcan9 tc
oiher means than immediately connected
with their conversion. It has not been
death, or sorrow nom the loss of friends,
which done good to their souls, but the
glorious truths of rovcla'ion. Only six
out of the multitude of the impenitent who
have wept at the more than three hundred
funerals, have indulged hope that the sorrow
on account of the loss of friends has
been connected with that guilty sorrow,
which needcth not tube repented of.
In connection with oiln:r means,?particularly
parental faithfulness and Subbath
school instruction, and the preaching
of the Gospel, and the reading ol evangelical
books?the cases of hopeful conversion
have varied from eight to thirty annually,
averaging about ten each year.
I speak not now of those who have though,
themselves Christians, but of such as by
their lives, have made the impression on
others and brought for1 It fruit by which
Jesus has authorized his people to form an
opiuion respecting character.?there has
been such love of the discriminating doctrines
of revelation, such delight in the
duties of the Gospel, such decision, and
meek, patient continuance in well-doing,
so Christ-like, such an anticipation ot
heaven, as to lead others to see their goon
works. Out of about two hundred whe
have indulged hope, not more than one
in forty have traced the means of theii
change, to events which it would seem
might have awakened t[)e most heedlesi
from their stupidity.

Ransom Britt, 1 Declaration in s
vs. > Attachment. [
E. P. Guion & Co. )
Whereas the Plaintiff in the above stated
case this day filed hie Declaration against the R
Defendant, who is absent from, and without
the limits of this state (as it is said) and having
neither wife nor Attorney known within
the same, it is ordered that the Defendant
annnar and nlead to the Declaration afore
i of preaching, by the presentation of the
doctrines ef the cross, in conversation, in
reading, and in parental instruction.
But the inquiry may still come up, why
are not people aroused by these startling
1 events to consider their ways, and look
1 for the ligkt which revelation affords?
May it not be, that the customs of society
1 in regard to mourning, have their influ1
ence in diverting the attention from God,
1 and drowning his voice when he speaks ?
In looking back to the affecting events to
which this article refers,, about five.sixths
1 < f the families thus visited by death, within
the circuit of my pastoral labers, have
immediately called the dress-maker, andtheir
houses have been turned into milliner's
shops fo. sev? ra! days, afur Go i's voice
1 has been uttered in their dwelling. One
instance may illustrate my meaning. A
family suddenly bereaved of a lovely child,
scarcely ventured out of their dwelling
? for some weeks, and it was not till tha third
Sabbath that a note was presented asking
! the prayers of God's p' ople i n the sa nctra y
because the matua-maker was so occupied,
as not to be obtained, thus giving indications
thai the customs of society res'
pecting mourning apparel, were more
thought of than God and his doings.
' Something near to this would describe a
multitude of cases.
' In the instances where there has been
a passionate and vehement exhibition of
grief, leaving the impression on every beholder
that death broke in upon the circle
as an unexpected obt:uJer, as though they
1 had not thought it possible that they and
their friends could belong to a mortal race,
I have never seen any evidence that an
individual has hecn permamcntly benefit,
ted. There have hcen bitter tears and
> heart-rending sighs, but of such violence
^ as to prevent reason, and reflection, and
piety from performing any office. Amma!
emotion has predominated, while the
rational nature has not been visible. Pas?
sionate grief may be as sinful as anger, it
I may betray as much recklessness and exert
? as blinding and hardening influence on
i the immortal nature of man.
It is evident, too, that there has been a
common impression that the death, the
providence merely, independent of Him
who has sent it, is somehow to effect a
change of feelings and of character in the
O O
i mourner without a personal and determined
attention to duty.
One, not my parisioner, but a highly
honored servant of Christ, gave the following
account of his own reflections on
thi i theme. At the age of sixteen or eighteen,
the subject of his own salvation was I
one on which his mind was deeply exerci'
sed as the all-important business of his life,
but after many self-righteous attempts to
secure, it, he dame to the result that it
! must be some extraordinary event that
would subdue his heart and so'ten so rock'
like a thing as was in his bosom. And
1 he gave over seeking till something re1
ruarkahle should occur. After the lapse
1 of some few years he was sent for in
1 haste to visit his dying father. He arrived
just in season to receive his last counsel,
hear his expiring groans, and all was over, i
1 * ' rfKn fiinoi-al
! with the son s D' 8i menu. in.
1 solemnities were attended and he was expecting
that so affecting a providence
wo tld move his heart. But it was like the
nether millstone. He could weep for his ,
loss, but not for his sins. He could trem- I
hie, but it was from fear of hell, and not
from the fact that (Jod was so near, and j
was actually speaking to him of his soul's j
salvation. Months pa&ed away and he
was left more hardened than ever. Death
coining so near to him, accomplished no
good for his soul.
In a subsequent period of his life, while
, travelling in astage, as he was watching
.* the rapid revolution of the wheels, and
thinking that every motion brought him
* nearer to the end of his journey, he pursued
the following train of reflections :
, This is like my journey to the grave and
11 to the retributions of eternity. Every
moment, every pulsation is like tins revolving
wheel. It hurries me on. Where
, am I going ? What are mv prospects for
eternity ! Now he was not thinking that
, some wonderful event must occur to aI
rouse him, he was not thinking that Jdeath
would make him feel, but his mind was
active, his energies were aroused, some- I
thing must be done, and the result was an
application to Him who can save the lost.
May not one of the causes why the
death of friends is so seldom connected
. with salutary results to the living, be found
| here ? There is anjexpccte.tion that the
, soul will be benefitted, without the per.
sonal resolute performance of duty ?
