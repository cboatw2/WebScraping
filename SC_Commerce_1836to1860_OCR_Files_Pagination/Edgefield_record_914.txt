EWRTu DAY-FRIDAY,. MAy9.
Tite convention met pursuant to -ud
jonrnment, Bishop Andrew in the chair,
and was opened with religious exercises
by Rev. Mr. Monroe, of the Missouri con
ference.
Bishop Andrew announced by request
of Bishop Soule, that he would read the
appointments of the committees called for
yesterday, which are as follows:
Financial Committee.-John Earley,
Lovic Pierce, William Winans, Alex. L.
P. Green,- and Benjamin T. Crouch.
Committee on Education.-Robt. Paine,
Augustus B. Longstreet, David S. Dog
get, B. H. afcCowy, Benjamin M. Drake,
C. Fulton, Wesley, Browning, Littleton
Fowler. and Samuel Bryant.
. The president then remarked he had
been requested by Bishop Soule to inform
the convention that he had to return home,
but would probably get back again on
Tuesday next.
Bishop Andrew addressed the conven
tion this morning at some length he briefly
related the facts conuected witb his elec
tion to the episcopacy, and showing the
extent of his connexion with slavery,
which had been the ostensible occasion of
the recent difficulties in the church. The
mild manner, the christian temper, and
tne manly independence of the Bishop,
could not. fail to make a most favorable
impression on the mind of every member
of the audience. He assured the conven
tion that, prior to his election to the epis
copy, he had never made any pledge on
the-subject of slavery, no man had asked
him his views, and no one requested of
him a pledge-any attempt of the kind
ivould have been treated with indignity.
Under these circumstances he was elected
to-the office. He accepted the office with
reluctance, and only consented to serve
the church in that capacity, because it was
considered of importance to the Southern
portion of the Methodist Episcopal Church.
He had served. the church to thte btest of
his ability, and though he had not per
formed his work as he himself could de
sire that it should have been done, yet his
administration htad been qutadrtentally
examined by-the genteral contference and
approved. His. statements in reference
to the manner in which he became con
nected with slavery, were substantially
the same as those heretofore laid before
the public.
lie vindicated himself against the char
ges made against him in the public prints,
and expressed his astonishrrent that any
one who should be charged with the edito
vial department of one oh our church pa
pers should allow such scantdaloos comtmu
-nications as have appeared in the columns
of the Western Christain Advocate. We
do not pretend to give the Bishtop's ad
dress, buit the effect on the convention and
the vast crowd of spectators were most
thrilling. The whtole assembly was
moved to tears, while nll seemed to admire
the candor and magnanimity of this great
ly injured, but spotless man of God, and
distinguished minister of Jesus Christ.
The appointments for religions exercis
es for the evetting were then read by the
Rev. Mr. Taylor.
The president called for memorials and
othei-business..
Mr. McFerrint rose and called the atten
tion of the convention to the following
article from the Western Christian Advo
cate of May 9th:
" We learn . that information reached
* Louisville on Saturday the 3d .inst., that
there is. a number of preachers from the
south who are making arrangements to.
sustain the Methodist Episcopal church in
their region, in view of the course the
delegates are taking. It is reported that
a private move is in progress in Louisville
to ascertain who are in favor of the old
-. church, and a meeting was about to be
called to see who were for sustaining the
interests of the Methodist Episcopal
Church." After reading the article, to
wvhich was appended a denial of its state
mD.ent signed b~y the ministere of the church
es in Louisville, he proceeded to state that,
so fr a hekne, terewasno .private
movement intitat city, either by the min
isters or people, with such an object in
viewv.
MIr. Brush, of Kentucky, rose and re
marked that it was not characteristic of
the Kentuckiann to hold secret meetings
and conduct such tWatters privately, and
*and for his own part be knew nothing of
the truth .of the statements made in the
Advocate.
M-e. McFerren then offeredthe following
-resolution, which was carried,. viza
Resolved, That the committee on fir
*nance be instructed to devises ways and
*means to defray the expenses incurred by
-Bishops Sotule and Andrew in attending
the convention, and report accordingly.
Thte resolutioni -offered by Drs. Smith
and Pierce on a preceding occasion was
then called up, and Dr. Longstreet occu
..:.. ,h r.e,.main der of the sessinn. when.
on motion, the convention adjourned.
Dr. L.. will conclude his remarks this
morning.
SATURDAY, May, 10, 1845.
The convention met pursuant to ad
journmerit, Bishop Andrew in the chair.
Religious services by Rev. J. E. Evans,
of Georgia.
The junrnal of 'yesterday being read,
the convention proceeded to business.
The president called for memorials and
petitions.
Rev. J. Green, of Missouri, presented a
preamble and resolutions adopted by the
members of Dorrett's class, Arrow circuit,
Missouri conference, which were read.
Dr. Longstreet resumed his remarks on
the resolution of Drs. Smith and Pierce
a mere synopsis of which occupies two.
columns of the Louisville Journal. We
make room, however. for the following
extract. which, we presume, is addressed
especially to the Baltimore Conference:
"Let me here drop a word to the bor
der conferences. I do not wish to elec
tioneer for allies; I desire all to choose
sides in this contest as they may think
best. As I believe that many of the
brethren on the border are laboring under
a delusion in regard to the treat ment which
they are to receive if they remain under
the old conference, I beg leave to give
them my opinion.-They think they are
to he treated'with all kindness by'their
old companions, as a reward for their
steadfastness. Not so-they will be but a
gudgeon to the trout. The little restrain
ing influence which we have exerted being
removed, these aspiring powers will mount
up like jhA balloon when its ballast is cast
oil', and wo to the few slaveholders who
remain under them. You will come to us
in the end, and you had better go with us
at the beginning. As to the church p-o
perty of which.you have heard, why let it
go,. if they have not truth and magnanimi
ty enough t give it to us.
As to the danger of making yourselveb
secessionists, according to the ethics of
Dr. Tomlinson, fortified by the logic of
Dr. Bangs and others, why be secession
ists rather than servile submissionists.
But anes will not change or form your
character. We may call ourselves Wash
ingtons, but it will not make us Washing.
tons-they may call us secessionists, but
that will not make us such. They may
possibly force us to an .experiment to as
certain what we are. ani what our rights,
and it will then be seen which is the true
church, that which is organized under the
sanction of a majority of the preachers
and conferences of our connection, or that
which claims to exist by virtue-of its own
inherent powers--whether the supreme
power be really in the general conference
or the annual conferences, or the preach
ers of the annual conference.
If in the latter, whether the general
conference, or even the supreme power
itself, can make rules which it will require
three-fourths of the sovereignty to change.
Of all this when it shall become necessary
to consider it. For the present, enough
to say that leaving the conference is uro
leaving the church, especially with consent
of the supreme power."
Dr. Longstreet having concluded his
speech, Mr. Dunwoody of South Carolina,
addressed the convention for the space of
an hour, presenting the subject of slavery
in its moral and religious aspects. Dr.
Paine next took the floor, expressing i
desire to offer some remarks, which, how
ever-, lie postponed till Monday morninig,
whereupon the convention adjourned.

A numbier of petitions and mnemorials
were then presented, praying for (he es
tablishment of the book concern at Lou
isville.
M1r. Evans rose and asked for privilege
to offer a resolution; leave was granted,
and he then submitted the following:
Resolved, T1hat in the judgment of this
convemtion, it is not necessary that the
general causes and necessities for a sepurate
organizatio3a should be discussed any lon
ger, unless some members from the border
conferences should think it proper to do
so, in order to represent their portion of
the church correctly.
No question ,was taken on'the resoln
tion, but several members from- the Ken
tucky and lAuinois Conferences, continued
to address the convention until the hour of

Resolved by thue Deegates of the several~
Annual Conferences in the South- and

Correspondence of the Courier.
.NEw-YoaK, May 14, 1845.
Fashion is beaten ! Peytona took the
purse of 20,000 yestarday over the Union
Course-winning the two first heats, in
7,398, 7,48. fil agree that no event in
the sporting world has evet created sro
great a sensation or drawn together so
great a concourse of people, Phere were
at least otne hundred and fifty thousand
persons on the ground yesterday, among
whom were a large number of the female
leaders in the fashionable world. The
Long Island Rail Road ran otne huiidred
cars and nine locomotives every houtr up
to 12. The race came off at a little after
one, with the trar-k heavy ivith sand, and
the course intolerably dry and dusty.
The feelitrg of the South against the North
was aggravated to altmost fury, and up
wards of S120.000 in side bets is ktnowtn
to have changed hands. Up to the strip
ping of the animals, the betting wan con
si(erably in favor of Fashion, but then it
waered round and wvas about even when
they started for the first heat. At the end
of the first heat, hedging commenced in
earnest, and the odds became decidedly in
favor of the Southern dame. The restult
was haileJ by tremendous shouts froii the
victorious party, and tokens of admirationi
even from the vanquished. Never was
there a more beautiful heat than the last.
Pushizon took the inside from thte first, and
kept it throughout, coming in under whip
and spur, but beaten by half a length.
For the first three miles and three quar
ters it was impossible to tell which horse
was ahced, and the an xiety was itntense
hushing the immense multitude into a
silence deep as death. As they turned
lown the back stretch, Peytona made de
monstrations for a brush, and o# the.
straight run home seemed gradually to
longate herself, inch by inch, unttl she
had gained half her length, which position
she maintained, despite the tremendous
exertiotts of her rival. The time. consid
ering the state of the track, and the sea
son of the year, is universally considered
as splendid.
Fashion has won twenty-three races
and never before lost one. Her blood is
the purest and noblest on the American
turf-and Peytona must now be considered'
he first horse in the Union.
The city never was so full of strangers
-every hotel, private boarding house,
avern and cafe, is crowded to suffocation,
and hundreds slept on chairs last night,
who will have a hard scramble for break
fast this morning. The South has achie
ved a fair, a glorious triumph. We con
gratulate her on her laurels!

On Tuesday last, the interesting and
important ceremony of Dedicating a Tem

by the Gramd Lodge of the State of Sou:h
Carolina, took place at Barnwell Court
House.
The Temple is a Insteful one, and the

miteresting local .reminisences with re

selves together as a select Brotherhood
that charity, benevolence, end good will t
the whole human family, more particu
ularly to the bereaved widow and father
less orphan, were the guiding ohjects of

the platdits of the sterner portion of the
auditory, and thte approbatory glances and
approving smiles of Heaven's last best gift
to man, lovely woman.
The procession was then re-organized,
and returned to the Ctourt llouse, wh'ere

form, and tlte Brethren dispersed, well
pleased with the ceremonies of the day.
In the afternoon, a Banquet wvas pre

the "Wisdom" to perpetuate these H-ea
venly virtues, that add "Beauty" to every
action and incident of life.
Drunkard's Wife.-None but those who
have passed through the sad ordeal, know
the sufferings of one who is fastencd by
inissoluble bonds to a miser-able druntkardJ;
one whose wrongs, whose patient sufferings
continually ascend on every breeze to the
throne of Goed; whose active and inextin
guishabhle affection is ever watching over
one who requites it all by hard hearted
abuse and neglect. Faith and hope are
the jewels that gliaten in her sotd; and
they shine in the midst of sorrow and
gloom, as stars in a dark stormny night.
Once joy and brightness filled her lot, but
now, lonely vigils, heart istrugg'les, brokee
hopes ; the wvreck .of all that is lovely,
have made her path (lark and her life a
cloudy vision. A trusting heart has beer
roken, and the conviction cotmes, and
that heart once the home of bliss, must be
the grave of sorrows, where ties buried
the wreck of her dearest hope. Too oftet
the heart that loves must bleed, hut whose
heart suffers as does the drunkard's wife 1

The Steam Vcssels of Great Britain.-The
Parliament of this country, has made appro
priations for a considerable increase in. her
naval force. The governmentshows plainly a
strong disposition towards the general employ
ment of steam vessels. The reason alledged
for this increase, is the necessity of having.
squadrons on the coasts of China, Africa and
in the Pacific. May we not add also on the
Atlantic coast? Should not our government
be on the watch as to the movements of Eng
land, and endeavor to guard our now defence
les1 coasts, by building and encouraging a ste
ficient number of steam vessels on the plan of
those employed in the Iritish mail service ?

Fros.-A letter from St. George's, Dor

datefi the 17th inst., says there wvas a white
frost on the ground that morning. We
fear thut this indicates an nseasoniable
lowness or temperature in the upper parts
of the State, which may prove greatly
injurious to the crops. A frost so late iu:
May is a very unusual occurrence so near
the city. In the city the wveather, for
