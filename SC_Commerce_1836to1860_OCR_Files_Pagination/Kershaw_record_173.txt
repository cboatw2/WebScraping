Vjeqetablk Diet.?"It has been maintained
by some men, distinguished for
learning and reasearch that vegetable diet J
is most conducive to health It seems <
singular that such men should advocate a I
doctrine of this kind in these enlightened t
?those Christian days. That such prin- ?
ciplcs should have been tought in the ol- t
den times by a Braminical priest or a Py- ?
thogoras, is not so wonderful, considering i
that the first belonered to a nunpraiitiAne
O |.w. I
priesthood, whoso doctrines were founded
in error; nnd that the latter, although wise}
in the wisdom of his day, was evidently
a wild theorist, who thought, by pervert-1
ing the laws of nature, he might change
man from a blood-thirsty animal to a lover
of peace. . Hence he taught,
"That man should over bo the friend of man;
Should view with tenderness all living forms?
His brother remmcts and his sister worm."
"That such a doctrine should gain proselytes
at the present time, when expe- 1
rience is the basis on which philosophers '
build systems of Hygiene, is strange indeed.
Does not the experience of every
physician prove that nothing would dele- ,
riorate the human constitution more than
an exclusive adherence to vegetable -iiet?
what physician is there that does not
inow the necessity of rich animal f?od
for the feeble and cachectic patient?? i
Examine our medical journals, nnd see
the experience of those attached to or- i
phan assylumns, and institutions of charity.

Of scrofulous diseases could only he
checked by the introduction of a larger ,
allowance of animal food and nourishing i

instances of large families of badly-fed <

escape; and it is well known to many in-|t
telligcnt planters in the South, thai thej>
best method of preventing that horrible ||
malady, Chachexia Africana, is to feed I (
the negroes with nutritious fo.?d. I have' {
sent several consumptive persons to the* |
Rocky Mountains, where they were compelled
to live entirely on animal food, t
and they have been returned well, not- i
withstanding the low temperature of the i
climate. Take from the Laplander or i
the Esquimaux his oil and his blubber, }
/md feed him upon roots, and he is no j
longer able to endure the chilling blast of
his native clime."

A Paris Journal has the following interesting
account of an event which befel
M. Desckainps, a wealthy inhabitant of
Lyons:

and the undertaker was on the point
of placing on the lid, and screwing it dowu
when the supposed defunct suddenly roused
from a mere lethargy into which he
had fallen, rose up, ana expressed a dej
sire for something to eat. A sudden pan'lc
for a lime paralysed all present but the
: sound of his voice dissipated their fears,
and every attention was immediately paid
him. He declared that he had been conscious
of all that was going on, but wss
unable to make the least movement. He
was soon so far recovered as to give assurance
of many years of renewed life
and activity."
Gov. Cass at Jerusalem.?A letter
from Jerusalem, dated August 14tb, mentions
a visit from Gen. Cass, (our Minister
to France) family and suite. They
arrived at Jaffa in the frigate Constitution,
and wete accompanied to Jerusalem by
Com. Elliot and several of his officers.
Gen. Cass, and family staid with Mr. and
Mrs. Whiting, (Missionaries of the American
Board, the latter of whom is from
this city;) and the remainder of the party,
8 in number, besides servants, with theRev.
Mr. Landeau, Mrs. Cass and her
daughters were in feeble health.
A close torque not always the
sign of a wise head. ColeHge tcjls &
story of meeting a stranger whoso silence
during dinner time, and his attention to
what others said, without interrupting
them, gave him a favorable impression or
his understanding till, unfortunately, on
the appearance of some apple dumplings
towurds the close of the repast, the delusion
was dissipated by the stranger suddenly
exclaiming?"Them's the jockies
for me." ,
Epigram.?An old gentleman Of the
name of Gould married a girl of nineteen.
He wrote a letter to a friend, informing
him of the happy event, with this
couplet:
'So you gee, my dear friend, tho' eighty years old
A girl ot nineteen falls in love wiln old Gould.'
Ho received a reply in these terms:
'A girl of nineteen may love Gould, it is true,
Hut believe me, dear sit, it is Gold without U.'
Original Anecdote of Matkias.?It
is not generally known, wo presume,
that this notorious imposter passed through
the Easternr part of this State sometime
since. While at Newbury, a large nutn!>er
being present, some one in rather a
aunting manner asked him lo exhibit a
niraclc. Without the least embariassncnt,
he replied, "1 have bean exhibiting

An Iron Horse.?A mechanic named
David Rittcr, of New Haven, has invented
an iron horse, that is propelled by
springs by the turning of a crank which
the rider does with the greatest ease; the
liorse is a fac-simile of a live one, and
will go at the rate of twenty miles an *
lour. *He thinks there will be no use 1
or rail roads, as it will be much cheaper, 1
is the horse will not eat one bushel of I
jits in fifty years, only a little oiling <
three or four times a year.
Great Mail Robbery.? It has re- |
cenlly been discovered that the Express (
Mail between Nashville, Tenn. and Louis- <

the carriers, of letters containing checks i
and daafts loan amount exceeding $70,- i
000!?perhrps much more, as this amount <
lias been taken from the culprits, besides ,
S3,000 in Bank Notes. The discovery j
was made by the robbers and their con- |
federates sending a bank draft of $1,500 |
to this city to be cashed. Lacking the en- <
dorsement,, it was sent back to Cincinna- <
Li, to Mr. Jartics Hicks, jr. in whose fa- |
vor it was drawn, and by him at once rcfc
cognized as one sent to him from New \
Orleans but not received. The facts |
Yere immediately communicated to the \

to planters generally a few ideas. ai
In looking over my cotton-seed since r<

while to ascertain from experiment, the ei
injury he sustained from the idiscriminate p
use of the sc.'d as it came from the cotIon.
Owing to the gales of the last ti
season, much, very much is premature?; tl

injured in those essentials which would h
render it good. If these seed are allowed rr
to be sown, the) will germinate?but

TEXAS-?THE MEXICANS AfiVANCING !
We find in the New Orleans slips a
letter from Captain Mcrvine, of the U. S.
Natcheze, dated offS, W. Pass, Mississippi,
Dec. 16, which states on the authority
of creditable information communicated
at Brassosde Santiago, that between Nov.
22d and ?7lh, tho Mexican Trqops crossed
the llio Grande in considerable forces,
consisting of two pieces of artillery, a
battullion of cavalry, and one of sappers,
there were 1200 men stationed 4ie^r the
bait Colorado, 20 miles east 'of MctamOra?,
iu the limits of Texas. On the 22d
100 men entered Matamoras from the
interior. The division in that place consists
of 3000 men. It is supposed that
the first movements of the Mexicans is
to take possession of the Aransa inlet,
which leads to Copano. The American
squadron was expected up in a few days
from Vera Cruz. , .
The New Orleans Courier in inks it
probable the Cumanclie Indians, who are
in considerable force in that quarter, arc
the objects -of this expedition. General
Felix Houston, who is at New Orleans,
informs the editor of the True American
that the Mexicans have had for sonie<timc~
3 to 10,000 men on the ttio Grande at
different points?all within five days march
of the river. lie sa) s this invasion was
foreseen, and the Tcxnns warned of it ill
vain. Filisola commands: >
"It is the opinion of Gen. F. Houston,
.hut Filisola will advance on the lower
owie by 6an Petrico, on the Neticos?
hence to I?a llahia and San Antonio to
Jopano?and thus divide the country in
wo, and keep up his communications
vith Mexico, l?y rebuilding the fortresses
it those places. That thispropositfon is
easible, appears in the know fact, that
filisola couuselled Santa Anna to take
has route, and not on any account to diride
his forces; the result of his neglect
>1 that advice is kuown, and is more likey
to make Filasola adhere pertinaciously
o his original plan/'
This route, is thought, will consurhc so
nuch tiine that the Tekns will have an
ipportunity to arm themselves and give
heir enemies a warm reception. Gen.
?. Houston thinks tlicre will be plenty of
roops to llock to the Texan standard
vithout llie necessity of calling on the
ettlers.
