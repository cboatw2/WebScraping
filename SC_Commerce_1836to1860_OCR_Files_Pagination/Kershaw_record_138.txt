T'lG subscriber informs the pultlic, that he has
just completed the mixture of thin valuable medicine.
He takes pleasure in stating that he has
made use of this PANACEA, successfully in a case
of Scrofula, which he has been afflicted with more
than tdrf.e years. On several occasions he applied
to practical Physicians for aid, (North and South.)
and received no 'nsnefit. He was, at length, prevailed
upon by numerous acquaintances, to try the
virtue of certain ROOTS and HERBS; and believing,
that the Receipt would greatly benefit him,
he took it, togethe* with an old Freivh Receipt: fro.i.
which is manufactured the VEGETABLE PANACEA.
It is proper here to sav, that the qua'itv of some,
or ai.i. the principal Roots, arc well known to the
Medical Faculty, by whom they are frequently used.
For Scrofula or King's Evil, Clcernted Sores,
general diseases of the BLOOf). or the effects of
Mercury ; it has a decided salutary effect.
For Bowei.Compi.aint he would aiso recommend
the use of the VEGETABLE PANACEA. Children
are frequently attacked with this complaint:
especially when teething. A few dosesol the PANACEA
will check the Bowels, and they liocome regular
again. It has l?een tried by a great number of
respectable individuals, and pronounced a "certain
cure." He has tried it at different times in his own
family, and it relieved the child immediately.
This Medicine is simple in its operations; and has
a pleasant taste. I
Give it a trial, and judge its worth.
The suhscrilwr will keop a constant supply of the f
Panacea at the different Grog Stores throughout I
the United Slates. Orders addressed to the subscriber,
or to James R. M'Kain, will l?c promptly attended
to The PANACEA may always he had at

IT is with great pleasure the subscriber informs

the VEGETABLE ELIXIR. This medicine is
composed of Roots which crow in this State. It is
useless to enter into a detail of the value of this Medicine.
( >r any other Root medicine,) ns it is well
known tbat all Roots have valuable Medical properties.
*lc would also stntc thnt thero is not the
least dancer in the use of rlie l-'i ivm cl?? r?i
lowing named diseases, there is no medicine made or
vended at the present time, hotter calculated to relieve
the alflicted, than the Vegetable Elixir.
For Rheumatism and Consumption, the Elixir
should he used internally and externally.
For Dyspepsia or Dvsury, he would also recommend
the use of the Elixir, as he feels confident
it will prove highly beneficial to those who use it.
To those who are afflcted with Pustules, Eruptive
Distempers, and Venereal diseases, he particularly
recommends the use nCthc VEGETABLE ELIXIR, i
Without the fear of contradiction, heTecominendsthis 1
Medicine as the best now in use?as it has proved
successful in every case in which it has been used.

fB HIS Gin can be made double, or single. 1: e
made double, they reduce labor, and gin jus |Y
double, the quantity of cotton over the single cylin- .
der Gin, no other knd having been in use prevout- !'
to thts patent*, and whether single or double, they
are found to improve the quality of the cotton, by
more perfectly cleaning it. They can be made to
contain from 20 to 1G0 saws in n stand, and whether
small or large, one hand will be sufficient to attend ^
them. The Gins have mechanical feeders and
hoppers attached to them, which free the cotton
trom leaves, trash, dirt, &c. belore it can reach the
saws, and by the thorough hackling operation it
receives from the feeders, which make two revolutions
to one of the saws, it is almost in a half
gined state, before it descends to the saw By a
very simple arrangement of a screw to each set ol
gaates, on which the hoppers rest, a d through
which the teeth of the feeders pass, they con be
made to teed slow or fast to suit ihe condition of
the cotton at the time. When made double, the
saws are placed on two sets of cylinders and turn
upon each other in opposite directions, and are ?
cleansed bv two sets of brushes that have four revo
uiioiiH 10 one or iwe saw. The two cylinders can
be detached so as to enable the planler to run one
pr both nt pleasure, although embraced with feeders.
&c. in cine stand. The whole is put in operation
with a drum and band, as in the ordinary Gin, and
inay be propelled by horse, steain, or water power
It may also be propelled by iron running gear. ?,
The force required to work it, is about the same as
that necessary to mnVean equal number of saws in p
the common Gin. This Gin has been put in
operation in New Orleans for two or three weeks,
and its success tested in the presence of a large
number of planters, merchants and others, and at
received their general approbation. f*
Several gentlemen have been so kind an to give
the Patentee their written opinion lespecting the 8
merits of the Gin. A number of others could be
added, but the following are deemed sufficient: ol

The mere fnct of its self-feeding, seems to me to
be n very alunble improvement; and besides, the
quality of the cotton, as it conies out of the pro- ni
cess appeared to me to be bqtter and rleaner than
from the common Gins in use, and that it saves
considerably in labor. Respectfully, Ac. I a'

Dr. A Jo1 es?Dear Sir, in answer tc your inqui y
of my opinion of your Patent Cotton Gin, I
>eg leuve to 6tate, that I was fifteen years engaged
in the cotton factories of Manchester, Engnnd,
and during four years of that time, 1 was
ore ma n in the house of Messrs. Lewis, Williams
it Co., and near five years spinner in the house of
rjessrs. bondford & Gr?enr. 1 have seen your
Cotton Gin in operation, and have examined the
niton ginned by it, and pronounce it better cleaned,
and the staple less injured, than any cottcn
hat ever came under my observation. It is comdetely
reat.j for the hrcuker without the aid of the
dower, and would, therefore, 6ave the first process
n manufacturing the article. 1 consider cottcn
leansed by your Gin, would command from one
o two cents on the pound more than the average
.tops brought into the Manchester market. 2
leansed by common Gtns Yours, very icsp iy.
