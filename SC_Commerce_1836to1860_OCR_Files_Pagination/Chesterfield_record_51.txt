JUDGE WiiUES REPLY TO TIIE HON. SHER??>D
WILLIAMS.
1? ishington, July 2, 1^33.
Dear Sir: Soon afier i:s da'e your
letter of the 7 h \pril last was received.
I then beiiew I -hat during the session ol
Congress. o;?;?<?r unities would be presented
of expressing my opinions upon some, il
not upon all the questions propounded ;
and t.uat those thus expressed would be
more satisfactory than any which could
be given in a letierof reasonable lengMi.
Let this be my apology for not giving
you an earlier answer. Upon the first
and second questions presented, I took occasion
to express my sentiments, when the
bill to distribute the proceeds of the sides ol
the public lands was under consideration in
the Senate; and my views in relation tc
the power of the Houses over their journals,
were given, when considering a reso
lution presented by myself, to rescind the
one adopted on. the 28th March, 1834,
Herewith you will receive copies of the
substance of my remarks on those occa
sious.
Upon the powers of the Federal Govern
merit to charter a b.ink, my opinion lias
been so often expressed, publicly and pri
vately, that I content myself with saying i
remains unchanged. I do not believe
Congress has the power to charter one, tc
exercise its corporate powers within tin
S'ates. and upon that opinion I must continue
always to act, until I can be satisfied
am in error.
The only remaining quuestion is, wheth
er I would approve an-J sign a bill to ini
prove a navigable river, or stream, above i
port of entry.
I am one of those who deny that Con
gross has the power to adopt and carry ou
a system of internal improvement, bv con
strutting roads and canals ftithin the States
In relation to navigable streams running
through them, Congress has the power t(
regulate trade among the States, and this,
think, confers the power to establish port:
of entry upon those streams, wherever th<
course of trade may require, exactly to tin
same extent that it has the power to estab
lish them 011 the sca-coasf, in virtue of th<
power to regulate commerce w'dhforcigi
nations. Whenever the port of entry i:
established on a navigable stream, for th<
purpose of regulating trade, I cannot per
ceive any reason for a dis'inc'ion in th<
power of Congress over the stream, abort
or beloic the |V>rt of entry.
Although I admit the power of Congress
to establish ports ot entry on our navigable
streams (or such purposes, yet I deny that
under pretence of exercising that power
t ?ere is an v right 10 commence or carry or
a system of constructing barters or clearitif,
out ricers at pleasure.
By its own legislation Congress canno
enlarge its own poicers. If, under the pre.
tence of regulating trade among the States
we grant that Congress may commence
and carry on a sysem of clearing oui
streams, and of constructing harbors within
the Statcsy merely at discretion, it ap.
pears to me we sanction a fraud on the con.
stitution; and that the exercise of such a
power will soon operate so partially and
unjustly, that the States cannot and will not
long submit to its exercise.
Congress may do whatever the course
of trade among the States requires, to regulate
it fairly ; but under a pretence of regulating
it, is not at ltberty to apply the funds
nfthp nntinn tr? imnrovements in some.
States, to the destruction of the intcres's and
the annihilation of the trade of others.
I am, most respectfully.
Your obedient servanf,
HUGH L. WHITE.
The Hon. Sherrod Williams.
From the Greenville Mountaineer.
On Monday the 5th inst. the people of
Newberry assembled to hear the Report of
their Delegates to the Knoxville Convention.
Judge O'Neal on the part of the Delegation
addressed the meeting, and explained
fully the present prospects of the scheme of
uniting the cities of Lousville, Cincinnati,
Maysville and Ciiarles'on by a Rail Road,
aud urged upon the people to subscribe
most liberally and generally for the s'ock,
on the third Monday in October next.
He was followed by Chancellor Johnston,
Dr. Mendenhall,& John Caldwell, Esq. The
meeting unanimously adopted a Resolution
iinrwilntintT r? f'nTimitfnr-' nf SO *?nrcrm? in
the different sections of the Dis'rict,to solicit
and obtain subscriptions to the s'ock of
the Louisville, Cincinnati and Charleston
Kail Road Company.
The impression after the adjournment of
the meeting was, that Newberry District
would take from ?100,000 to 8200,000 of
Stock.
Early Frost.?The Boston Daily Advertiser
of Saturday says : "The severe frost
of Tuesday night appears to have put an
entire stop to the vegetation of many
} l.mts which usually continue to grow two
months later. Indian corn is killed ; very
little, if anv, in this vicinitv, having been
ripened the present season. Melons,
squashes, cucumbers, beans, and other
garden vegetables are killed. This will
occasion a serious loss throughout New
England, and cause a severe deprivation to
very many persons."
Black Teas.?A letter to a gentlemar
in New York, dated Canton, (China,) Apri
Hd, says: " All green teas are cured witl
Prussian blue, to give them a good color, ant
are hence therefore considered by the Chi
nese as partly poisoned. No class of Chi
nese use any description of green tea, ex
cept to sell, neither do any foreigners wh<
have resided any length of time in thecoun
try. The best and highest priced greei
teas, however, are tinged with but very litrh
Prussian blue, whilst the cheaper kinds art
much alloyed with this ingredient. I cat
confirm this from having witnessed the man
ufaciure of teas for the last three years ii
this empire. Black teas, of every grade, art
perfectly free from alloy, and art? considers
hy the Chiru very wholesome."

! brutish parliament?slavery in texas,
j Mr. Hay on the 0;h of August in the
I House of Commons moved an "Address to
the Crown, praying that Ids Majesty will be
graciously pleased to direct that such mca;*!
sures may betaken as to his Majesty may
| seem proper, to secure the fulfilment of the
i existing treaty between this country and MexI
ico; aud.to prevent the establishment of slave,
rv and the traffic in slaves, in the province j
; of Texas, in the Mexican territory." He
II said that the question was a very important
> | one to this country, as we had in the pro.
' I vinco in question property to the amount of
f i TO,000.000 dollars. The Texas had already
11 been dissevered from Mexico, and might
> j fall, along with Cuba, into the hands of the
. ! United States.
.! lie begged to ask the noble lord, if within
j (the last ten days he had not had an applica.
I tion from the Mexican Government, reques?
ting the mediation and good offices of Co1
. I vcrnment, to remonstrate in an amicable
' manner with the Government of the United
. ' States, on the gross violation of tiie treaties
;) between these Stares and Mexico, and the
. | aggression which had taken place against
t ' Mexico on the part of the southern States
j of the Union. The honorable member then
> quoted the authority of Mr. Huskinsson and
? of John Q. Adams, to show the design en
tertained by the United States to extend
I i their dominion to the territories of other
Powers in the neighborhood of 1 heir own.
The acquisition of Texas would lead to
. the establishment of the States as a comi
mercial power of dangerous importance;
it would place them in a commanding posi.
tion on the Allaa.ic and the Pacific alike;
II and while, on the one side, they would be
.' distant only six weeks' sail from the conn.
| try; on the other, they would be distant only
r' six weeks sail from China and those oilier
} i countries of the East wirh which a facility of
I I intercourse was always so adventageous,
51 and so much desired. Unless Mexico were
? | at once assis.ed by this country, it would
3 fall an easy prey to the United States.
. | Viscount Palmerston said that iflte began
. I bv declaring that he did not feel himself at
* i y o
i liberty to agree to the address proposed by
the honorable gentleman, he trusted that
i neither he nor the House would imagine that
1 circumstance to be any proof that he did
not feel fully the importance of the subject
! to which that address related, or that his
Majesty's Government were not as much
i animated as lie was by a desire to put an end
to those events to which mainly it referred.
He thought, however, that he should satisfy
11 the House that in some respects the address
, ! would be unnecessary, and in others it
r i would be premature. The observations
made by the honorable gentleman, and by
I his honorable friend behind him, (Mr. Ward,)
. divided themselves, strictly speaking into
two different branches, the one of them rey
t 7
; lating to the political part of the question,
I j and the other relating to that part of it which
, | regarded the trade in slaves. With refer.
| ence to the political part of the question,
, j undoubtedly the possibility of the annexa,
| tion of the province of Texas to the United
II States was a subject which ought seriously
j to engage the attention of the House and
| the country. But he did not think that the
t' invents which had yet occurred afTorded them
| any ground for thinking that there was at
i present ony such probability of that kind as
1 ? T . 1* I I /"I
I to cull upon tne nouse 10 auurcss uie urown
I with reference to it. The state of Texas
; at present was this : A revolt had taken
| place in that province, and a Mexican army
i tiad been despatched thither for the purpose
I of putting it down.
j The Government of Mexico was prepari
ing, according to our latest advices, to make
t fresh efforts to reinforce their army, and he
i *%
j thought we were not in a position to infer
from any thing which hail happened what
might possibly be the result of the contest.
But with respect to the conduct of the Unij
ted States, although ho was aware of the
I fact stated by the honorable gentleman, ar.d
! by his honorable friend, that individuals in
j those States of the Union which bordered
i upon Texas had undoukedly given great
| assistance to the revolted population, yet, if
; we looked to what had been the conduct of
! the responsible Government of the United
States, wc should find in the message sent
to Congress by the President, at the beginning
of the session a most unequivocal decla!
ration that the government of the United
j States would take no part in that civil war,
nnv. farther. we should that orders had I?een
| issued by that Government to enforce the
i laws of the States, and prevent individual
subjects from mixing in that dispute.
lie (Lord Palmerston) bad too high an
opinion of the honor and good faith of the
j Government of the United States not to be|
iieve that they would act up to their declai
ration ; and he thought, therefore, that fresh
! circumstances ought to arise before it would
j be fitting on the part of the House to send
j up to the Crown an address bearing on that
j political branch of the question. With res.
pect now to that part which related to the
: trade in slaves: he did not think that there
was anv danger?anv considerable danger
c t ? C
, ?.hat such an evil would be the result of
,: the civil war; because it was evident cither
I' that Texas would be reconquered by Mexico,
. j and the authority of Mexico re-established
, i therein, or else the province would assert
! its indepcnce and become a separate State ;
I or thirdly, indeed, it might unite itself wit}i
i i the United States of North America. If
1 the Government of Mexico re-established
i its authority in Texas, then the laws of Mex1
ico would come into operation in that coun
try; and, therefore, as far as the internal ad-!
ministration of Texas was concerned, there
- would be no more encouragement given to
) the slave trade in that part of the Mexican
. territories than in any other. With refer1;
encc to any tiling which the Government of
: * Mexico could do, it was obvious, whether
2 their authority were thrown offin Texas or
l not, that while they were unable to rule in
- that country and to make their laws to he
l there obeyed, it would be useless to apply
? to thern to interfere lor the purpose of put1
ting down the slave trade in that province.
I In the next place, if Texas established its
t 4
independence, if would be for the Government
of England, by addressing itself to that
Slate, Jo enter inio such negotiations as
would induce its Government to enter info
those engagements for the suppression ot
the slave trade which we had persuaded
many nations to contract, and which, he
trusted we should persuade all the nations
of the civilized world in like manner to contract.
If, again, by any progress of events at
any future distant time, Texas were to become
a member of the Union, then, undoubtedly,
there would be some danger that
at least from other States of America, slaves
might be introduced into the province-ol
Texas, but there would not he any real danger
in practice of the importation of slaves
brought from the coast of Africa, or from
any of the West Indies. If there had been
hitherto an importation of slaves into Texas,
which he was inclined to believe there had
been, it would be found, he apprehended,
that they had come from Cuba and some
neighboring places iu the West Indies; he
had not heard of any cargoes being brought
to Texas direct from die coast of Africa.
With regard to the importation from Cuba,
that was a branch of a larger question which
he trusted, had been satisfactorily settled.
The House knew that we had concluded a
treaty with Spain for the suppression of the
slave trade, containing what he hoped and
what he thought would be most elfectual
provisions for putting an end to the slave
trade under the flag of Spain. That treaty
had only lately come imo operation, and,
therefore, the statement which the honorable
geiftlemau had made as to the transfer
of slaves from Cbba to Texas related to a
period of time, and a state of tilings antecedent
to the practical operation of the new
treaty. It was well known that some years
ago we persuaded the French Government
to enter into a treaty by which a mutual
right of search, subject to certain limitations,
was conceded by one country to the other.
The treaty likewise contained other regulations,
having for their objeet the suppression
of the slave trade.
What had been the effect of that treaty I
Until then, the trade in slaves was carried
on to an enonnons extent under the flag ol
France ; hut he believed that, from the moment
tiie treaty came into operation, not a
single slave-ship had sailed under the ilag o!
that country. We had now also concluded
a treaty with Spain. Previous to the con.
elusion of this treaty, and perhaps he might
say, almost up to the present moment, the
flag of Spain had been extensively used for
the purpose of covering the abominable
traffic. I Ic, however, trusted and believed
that the same provisions which in the treaty
with Prance had proved effectual in suppressing
the illicit traffic carried on under
the French flag, would, in the treaty with
Spain, be found equally effectual in preventingit
from being carried on under tho flag
of the latter country, and that the enormous
trade in slaves carried on with Cuba in de.
fiance of our representations to the local
-i /*.t . _i i i _/
{Minorities 01 mat isianu, unu in reproucn 01
the good faith of the Spanish Government,
would finally be put an end to, as well as
that subdivision of the traffic which had flow,
ed into the territory of the Texas. There
was another fl;ig which had, perhaps, been
more abused for the purpose of the slave
trade than that of Spain ; he meant the flag
of Portugal.?(Hear, hear.)
The papers which have been laid upon
the table contained sufficient evidence of the
abominations carried on under that flag, and
hardly a week passed without his receiving
fresh accounts, each exceeding its predecessor
in the enormity of the facts disclosed.
It, therefore, gave him much pleasure to be
able to s ate to the House that this country
had entered into negotiations with Portugal
for the purpose of concluding a treaty precisely
similar to that concluded with Spain.
These negotiations were brought so nearly
to a conclusion, that he expected, before
many weeks elapsed, to receive the treaty
nnd. if Mat should be the case, he
" ft"? 5 7 ,
trusted that the slave trade, now being carried
on under the Portuguese flag, would be
put gown. Then there would remain chiefly
to be considered the flag of Brazil, which,
in spite of a treaty, had, to a certain extent,
been appiied to that purpose. The Government
of Brazil had lately signed two supplementary
articles containing the essential
stipulations, tor want of which the existing
treaty had proved ineffectual; he meant the
stipulations respcting equipments and breaking
up of vessels. We had now, therefore,
associated with us in the common causes
of putting down the slave trade, almost all
the maratime Powers whose flags could be
abused and prostituted for that purpose.
The Brittish Government was going still
further than ibis.
They had made a proposition to the Government
of Austria, Prussia and Russia, who
had not hitherto concurred in any treaty on
the subject, in consequence of which those
Powers had agreed to a treaty conjointly
with France and England ; and he hoped
that, before a considerable time elapsed, he
would be in possession of the ratified document.
Me must say, therefore, that the
subject of the slave trade in Texas was a
comparitively insignificant branch of a much
greater and more ex ensive question; and
if we should succeed, and he trusted it would
be the case, in carrying our object into effect
with respect to the general question,
little apprehension need be entertained on
the score of Texas. If, however, it should
appear that the importation of slaves into
Texas still continued, it would undoubtedly
be the duty of the Government to take such
steps as circumstances might require to endeavor
to put an end to the abuse. Upon
political grounds, therefore, he thought it
was unnecessary for the House to address
the Crown on the subject of Texas; and,
with respect to the question of the slave
trade, he ventured to say that it was equally
unnecessary to.approach the throne; and, it
the House should take an unnecessary step
in addressing the Crown upon a point with
respect to which His Majesty's advisers were
already prepared and willing to act, it would
be casting a censure upon the conduct of the
Government, which he believed the honora
hie mover of the amendment did not intend I
;
to convey. !1

his remarks were the following : From the j

of the United States, by fair means or foul, j
to obtain possession of the province of Texas t
The United States had encouraged ail the

boundary line between the United States and J
Texas, and to take possession of the latter, j
This was done, the lands of Texas were ?

a Texian land scrip was created, and the j

, years. Our connexion with Mexico was ,
i rendered too, more intimately by this cir|
cuinstance, that we possessed a large capi. (
| tal invested in mining adventures in that (
! country. It was impossible, then, to con
template, without anxiety, events having a ,
, tendency, separately, to sever from the?
, Mexican State a most valuable portion of J
its territory, and to place our trade with that
k Slate at the mercy of a commercial rival. 1
. The noble lord must be aware that, in lb23, [
' there had been a somewhat similar project, 1
; on the part of the United States, to obtain
; possession of the island of Cuba. There
| were at that time in Cuba three parties, sev- ]
t orally wishing for a connexion with England, t
France and America; the mutual jealousy ]
. of the three countries, however, prevented j
? any one of them from taking possession of
the island, and they came to a solemn treaty,

terfore with it, but tiiat it should be left in 1
t the possession of Spain. The other con- i
f sideration, of whicii lie had spoken as one i
[ which ought to have weight in the discussion
of the question, was the consideration
of moral feeling which must influence eve- j

The question to be decided under this view
i of the subject was whether, for the purpose
of maintaining that demoralizing system, J
they would allow the annexation of the territory
of Texas to the United States. In a I
pamphlet recectly published upon the sub- t
ject in the Union, a greater fear was ex- i:
' pressed as to the consequence of such an a
event on the part of the non-slaveholding r
Slates; for cloubtless the Iloise must be r
aware that the States were at present divi- r
ded into two great parties, the slavcholding
and the non-slaveholding States?that a ^
struggle had been for some time carried on j(
between them in the National Legislature,
and that the parties were now pretty equally '
balanced. The result of the annexation of *
the province of Texas would be the creation a
of nine additional slavcholding States, with e
eighteen representatives in the Congress at v
Washington ; and that circumstance would t
put an end to all hopes of doing away with t
the system which formed the most degrading
feature in the whole frame of the United p
States. j

At 10 o'clock this momiug, 15th inst. as our y
paper was in form, Mr. Higginbotham, who
lives at Cedar swamp, 7 miles distant towards
Garey's Ferry from this place, came in bare- (
headed, at full speed of his horse, reporting o
that at break of day this morning the Indians y
made an attack on his house, into which they
tired a number of balls. Four or five Indians,
distant not more than 30 steps fired at Mr. 0
William Thomas, striking afire in the house d
?but not hit him. Mr. Thomas shot at an c
Indian's head and thinks he hit it. Mr. Hig- b
ginbotham had a fair shot at an Indian, and
thinks he wounded him. There were two
men in the house beside Mr. H. himself, one ti
of whom is sick. They having nine guns, beat e
off the Indians, so that they ceased firing, _
when Mr. H. caught his horse and set out for r,
Jacksonville, leaving his family and the two e
men to defend themselves. The Indians had
taken his saddle ana oriaie ana atiempiea 10
catch his horse but could not. They also Q
turned loose his cattle from the pen before _
they commenced the attack. Firing was r,
heard last night in that neighborhood, and as r,
there is quite a settlement yet unabandoned
in that vicinity, Mr. H. thinks that other
houses have been attacked and the dwellers (
murdered. d
A number of families from Alachua, are liv- c
ing in that settlement, having sought safety r
1 there from the Indians, but it seems they
1 sought in vain.
All is bustle here?horsemen and steeds are (
* hurrying " to and fro." In our town we can- (]
, not count over a dozen mounted men. They c
armed?mounted?and while we are writing b
this, are off at foaming *peed to the -escue.
An express is sent to hi..^ Cteek toreport

send a company to intercept the retreat of the \
j Indians. n
Wo shall wait in painful suspense?iinpaience
on the tip-toe?till our returning citiens
bring us full intelligence of the darli
leeds of last night and of this morning.
We have just heard that the Indians tool
5. J. Eubank's horses last night.
Jnst as our paper was going to press an ex
>ress arrived with important despatches fron
he Governor.
^ We learn that Gov. Call, invested Major B
Pierce with an independent command of ai
he troops west of the St. Johns, with order
o Col Crane to send immediately all his dis
>osable force from St. Augustine and East o
. Johns, to join Maj. Pierce, who is to repor

We further learn that Gov. Call expects t<
)e in the field by the 25th inst. with Tennes
;ee volunteers and the middle Florida Militi:
ind that Major Pierce is to join him with a]
he regulars west of the River St Johns.
From the above we fondly hope that some

DEATH OF COL. BURR.
v This extraordinary individual died on Tues*
day afternoon, at the Richmond House, Mese31
reau's Ferry, on Staten Island, in the eightyS
first year of his age. Col. Burr has been cont.
fined to his room for the last year, but has enn
joyed uncommon fine spirits, and was able not
only to discourse with his fin'ends, but to aro
rage his papers for publication. Few men
have made a more conspicuous figure in

5- 1756; joined the American army under Gen.
0 Washington, then before Cambridge, ae a volunteer,
in August, 1775. He marched from
ir Penobscot with Gen. Arnold, through the wil15
derness to Quebec, one of the most fatiguing
i- marches ever recorded. The suffering enduril
ed b v this band of American troops has hardly a
parallel. He was aid to Gen. Montgomery,
on the ever-memorable night of the 31st December,
1775, when the assault was made on
the city of Quebec, and at which his distinguished
commander fell. After serving with
o fidelity and honor in the campaign of Canada
he returned to New York, and entered the
family of General Washington, at his (Gen.
* W.'s) request. He was soon appointed Aid
t to General Putnam, and fought bravely in the
y battle of Long Island; after which, he was
0 made Colonel, in 1775, and remained in the
Army, and was a conspicuous officer in the
" battles of New Jersey. In 1780, lie retired,
in consequence of ill health, arising out of his
- fatigues at the battle of Monmouth. As soon
as peace was declared, he was appointed a
Judge of the Supreme Court of this State,
which honor he declined. He served as Ats
torney General until he was chosen United
States Senator, which he held from 1793 to
e 1799. In 1801, he was chosen Vice President,
s which office expired in 1805. The 4th of
July, 1804, he killed General Hamilton in a
e duel, which put a final end to his political
3 career, and, in fact, drove him from his country.
He then engaged in the celebrated
? Burr's expedition destined to Mexico?wa?
taken, tried, and acquitted, at Richmond, in
1 1807. He soon left the country, and return
ed about 1811, and commenced his profession
r as Councillor at Law. He has been engaged
i in a number of important causes which have
reached our highest courts.
a Within the last lew years, he htus enjoved
, an annuity of about fourteen hundred dollars,
' and a pension of six haudred, in all about two
* thousand, so that he has been comfertable in
r his circumstances. We are happy to learn
] that he has left all his valuable paper? to the
5 care of Matthaw L. Davis, Esq. A more talen5
ted individual could not be found, and he has
r now one volume of his life ready for the press.
