The Bank of the State <>f South Carolina
is in a .sound condition, and under the
prudent management of an cilidont Directors,
and al)!e and assiduous oflieors,

to the Sinking Fund, now amounting
to SmsotT/ 3b. $ Too, ooo of tliis amount
wiii b -apolh d, on the 1st January next,
i ; . ; ..dors of the (?percent. Stock
of this State, created under an act of the
Legislamiv, parsed in one thousand eight
hundred and twenty, and redeemable on
the aluve mentioned day. I herewith
submit the Annual Statement of the Bank.
The true condition of tlic Banks of the
Slates, is. at all times, a subject of 'loop
interest to the people, but more especially
at a crisis like the one in which we are
now placed. For the puro xc, therefore,
of exhibiting to the public their present
situation, I applied to them for statements,
shewing their respective liabilities and assets.
With a praiseworthy promptitude,
each of them responded to the call, by
furnishing me with reports on the several
p >iiits of enquiry, which I now lay before
you for yoiu information. The country
was just recovering from the shock which
the revulsion of eighteen hundred and
thirty seven had produced, which another
crisis m our momentary affairs, accompanied
by the suspension of specie payments
by some of the Banks, has again thrown
the business and commerce of the community
into confusion. The frequency
of these suspensions, demonstrates the ex
istcnce "of some inherent vices in the
Banking -system, or mismanagement by
those who control its operations, and administer
its affairs. It becomes your duty,
as the guardians of the rights and interests
of the people, to take cave that the
Republic receive 110 detriment. You are
urged by every consideration of sound
policy, and a just regard to the welfare
of the country, to probe the evil to the
; bottom, and, by the application of the prosper
remedies, to bring back these moneyed
corporations, to a healthy performance
of their functions. Indeed, the Banks
are as much interested in the investigation
and reformation of these defects, as the
community; for, without an efficient re
mcdy, the Banking svstem must terminate
in convulsion, which it is the interest of
all to avoid. If, however, the mischief
recoiled upon the Banks alone, then it
would be a matter which would not concern
the public. But, unhappily, the
whole community are the victims of the
evils which ensue. The derangement in
the currency, consequent on the refusal
of the Banks to redeem their bills in specie,
affects the price of the great staples
of our country, which arc the instruments
of ail our commercial exchanges. The
value of property, of every chscription,
the disturbance of the relations between
creditor and debtor, and iii fact, tlie
whole business of society, in all its relations,
experience the disastrous effects
of this depreciation in the currency. This
is not an exaggerated picture of the evil.
The suspension, by the Banks, is a departure
from the purposes for which their
charters were granted, and a plain violation
of those duties, which are enjoined
upon them, in the terms of their creation.
The previous History of the country, in
relation to the chartered companies, enforces
the necessity of placing new safeguards
to prevent the evils which have
been felt. All charters, which confer exclusive
privileges on certain persons, intrench
upon the equal rights of the rest
of the community. Itiscertain, they renin
i-i? to roa? ra iPil lprrnl ennflmoi'tc:
and yet ilie charters, by which artificial
persons arc created, are held up as con
laining all the regulations concerning them
within the competency of the Legislature.
It might be wise and politic, to prevent
future evil, for the Legislature to pass a
general law upon the subject of all charters,
subsequently to be granted, reserving
the right t<? make such further provisions,
as may be required to keep thrm
within the limits of their appropriate duties,
and compel them to fulfil the objects
of their creation.
In giving you " information of the condition
of the Stalp," I should feel that I
was justly obnoxious to the charge, of
r? o it I t\/s f ? ? ? rr nrto r\ f 4 li n moc4 irYt nnrhi n!

branches of industry, were I to be silent
on the subject of Agriculture. This pursuit
of the great mass of the people, has
claims upon your fostering care and attention.
Ilia the source of our wealth, and
! power, and furnishes the means of our
{commercial exchanges. Yet its importance
seems never to hare been realized
; by the constituted authorities of the State;
i f.?r it is a lamentable truth, that while
| other branches of industry have received
'an impulse, by wholesome laws, the great
:{interests of Agriculture hare been passed
: by almost with silent contempt. It is now
" time lor the Slate to dismiss from her
counsels this cold indifference, and to take
such action on the subject, as will prni
mote its success which have retarded the
1 progress of the State in population, wealth,
and importance, none is more prominent
than the utter neglect of this primary purisuit
It cannot be doubled, that ?\>?uilh
(Carolina once possessor! n soil of unsurpassed
fertility, Put this rich gilt of
u kind Providence, has been, in a great
measure, lost, by a most pernicious course
of husbandry. A large portion of this
once flourishing region* blessed, too, with
a propitious climate, lias been reduced to
sterility. Yet, nil hope of reclaiming and
restoring to its wonted productiveness,
our exhausted soil, is not in vain. It is a
Imncficient provision of a good Providence,
that beneath the surface of the
earth, arc to he found substances of the
most fertilizing qualities. Their discovery.
however, requires tliK application
of science, and means seldom possessed
by individuals. It is, in such a case,
that a tvise and patriotic Legislature should
extend its aid. But to subserve fully, the
interests of Agriculture, tire Legislature
should not continue its operations to a
Geological " Survey alone. Willi this
sh uld be connected an Agricultural Survey.
While fhe former would bring us
;.cnusii 111f-il tt-iib all the substances which
enter into the compo-i.ion of that portion
of the earth to which we ran hare
access, the latter will elicit a inass of information,
in relation to every thing (hut
iconcerns agriculture, which cannot fail to
ibe highly useful. In other countries, the
Utility of agricultural surveys has been
fully proved, by the valuable rrstihs.?
But, in carrying into effect such surveys
as have been mentioned, the value of tite
: results would depend upon the selection
iof an individual, possessing the highest
qualifications, combining a profound knowledge
of the subjects of investigaiion, a
j sound discriminating judgment, and an
untiring zeal and industry. The expense
of such a project, should not be weighed
against the incalculable importance of the
end proposed. Being deeply impressed
, with the practical usefulness of such surreys,
I earnestly recommend that you
provide for their accomplishment.
But while the development of the physical
resources of our country should
claim so large a share of your serious attention,
popular education ought to hold
the first place in your estimation. It is
knowledge, intellectual, moral, anil religious,
that constitutes the man. Without
its possession, wealth would he a
curse, instead of a blessing. Besides,
the stability and permanence of our republican
institutions, have their only
guarantee, in an intelligent, moral, and
religious population. Hence, this import
lant subject has commanded tho warmest
regard, of those who have preceded us*

are enduring monument?, to the memory
of those, by whose sagacious "{forts they
were brought into existence. The foi'mer,
from small beginnings, has risen to a proud
eminence among the literary institutions
of our great Confederacy, and is annual
ly .sending f-?r?li a band of well cdneatcc!
youths, the future glory and ornament of
their country: the latter, although based
upon the soundest principles of a free
government, lias not yielded all those benefits
which its intrinsic excellence so
justly deserved. At your last session,
commissioners were appointed, in every
election district of the State, to examine
and revise the Free School system, and
to report to the Executive such amendments,
or alterations, as lltsy might deem
useful. Many of these commissioners,
with a very commendable zeal and ability,
have discharged Che important duty assigned
to them, while others have tailed
i to make reports. In obedience to your
J resolution, I have placed the reports which
ihave been made, in the hands of a coinmission
of two gentlemen, Professors
Elliott and Thorn veil, to be examined by
them, and a system to be advised and suhmitied
to yon, at the present session.?
Their report, as soon as prepared, shall
he transmitted to you, with the teports
^nf the district commissioners.
; It aflords me unfeigned pleasure, to announce
to yc\ that the College continues
to answer tfie high expectations of the
Slate. It is rapidly advancing in a career
cf prosperity and usefulness, which
. must redound to the lasting benefit of the
country. It steadily increases in numbers,
although the standard of admission
is higher than formerly. I ardently recommend
this noble institution to your
parental anil fostering care. The State
ran only expect to maintain its wonted
high charar.ii r, by an cnlighted population,
well grounded in solid learning,
and a lofty moral elevation.
In a free government, there exists a
just jealousy of standing armies. The
liiit ry of all nations justifies this feeling.
Its records are replete with instances of
their danger to liberty. Our ancestors
had a practical knowledge on this subject,
which led them to guard, by constitutional
restrictions, against their introduction.
Hence, the reliance of the framcrs of our
constitution, on the Militia, and the provision
for organizing, arming, and disciplining
it. Hence, the recognition ol the
great political truth, that a well regulated
Militia, is essential to the safety of a I'reo
Stntv; and certainly our ancestors were
not deceived, in their estimate of thp dependence
which might be reposed in its
c&rLr.cv. F r the purpose of defensive
warfare, it will not be hazarding too
much, to assert, that Militia arc equal, if
not -uperi.tr, to mercenary troops. The
noblest and highest motive that can actuate
toe bosom of man, impels the citizen
soldier :o draw bis sword, to rope! the in
i? ... i.:- .....t ... ,l..r?,wl ..li .
ami fireside. It may be conceded iliat,
for purposes "f foreign conquest, regular
troops are more available. But, happy
for ns thai it is so: this great Confederacy
of R publican States, is. friun its charact?
r, pacific, and never can ue prone to
engage in wars merely for winning glory,
or acquiring foreign dominion. From
these considerations, we learn the vast
importance of a well regulated Militia.
To prepare them to fulfil the high desti
nies for which they are intended, carc
should be luken, to train and discipline
them m times <T peace: hut this duly applies
more especially to the officers. I
am aware ilial freemen will not submit to
ilios- rigi-i rules, which are applicable to
the regular soldier: nor is '.bis required.
The idea is not entertained, that the private
militia-inan can, or ought to be, subjected
to the same degree of rigorous discipline,
as a soldier, in the regular ranks.
Indeed, it is questionable, whether lite attempt
to give the private militia-man the
automation precision of the soldier, should
i - i- ..ii i. t.?
IJIZ HltlUf Ul Uil? II i ."5 III/l Ul HUI L?U I" 11L
essentia! to the perfection of our systffn,
that any such attempt should be made.
But the rate is widely diflcreut with the
militia ofiicers: they rnav be instructed,
and brought to a high degree of discipline
in the military art. /.ml if the ofiicers
have attained to a respectable degree of
knowledge, it will not be difficult for
them, in a period of actual service, to
train their men, in a short lime, in all the
duties of the soldier. South Carolina has
acted on the assumption of this idea, and
'all her militia laws look particularly to a
body of well trained and disciplined ofiijcers.
And perhaps no instrument has
been more useful in accomplishing this
tern', than Btigadc r.nrampments. It will
be readily admitted, that these assemblages
arc attended with much inconvenience to
the ofiicers and sergeants. But liberty
can only he maintained at the expense ol
great sacrifices, and eternal vigilance.
Exemption from inconvenience, would bean
inadequate compensation, for the ease
and inactivity of despotism, which would
follow the introduction of standing armies,
in the place of the Militia. Nevertheless,
the Legislature should seek to render the
performance of this duty as little onerous
as possible, consistent with (lie great o!>
ject to be effected. Perhaps the system
hears with mure oppressive weight on the
- sergeants, who are compelled by law in
serve a limited time, no matter what m ;
be their means. To alleviate the burden
as much as possible, ! wruM rc]:c?t ihr

community iike ours, where the articles. - '
transported by the planter to "market, are **
heavy and bulky, the necessity is^loubly
urgent, to construct such highjyaysAg will 'Jy
facilitate ttse transportation. ThcTrpairs
I of the roads, by t!ic exisiim l.iv. J, depend
upon the labor of the inhabitants, fo/ynot
more than twelc days in the yg>tr. Thesystem
operates uneijually. While the labor
bestowed upon certain portions of the rn;
ids i>> cnfTifMpnl In mninlnin llmm in
good order, in other portions, the samelabor
would be wholly insufficient. From ?
the face of the country, its tmevenness, >
and the nature of the soil, more labor will
be required in some sections, than in"others.
Again, those portions of the country,
which lie more contiguous to the : i
market towns, from tlio greater amount
of travelling over them with heavy wagons,
and often from the nature of the
soil, and irregularity of surface, require
vastly more work to put ami keep them
in good order, than in oilier portions, more /.
remote, and tnore favored, in the circumstances
mentioned. Ilence, one portion y.
of the inhabitants, is subjected to a great- ; v ;"
er degree of labor, than another, and not
exclusively for their otvn benefit, hut for;-.*"- '

class, who have expended no labor, on ' ^
these roads. To remedy this inequality,,.

i If, however, the twelve clays' labor, most
faithfully expended, which the inhabitants
are bound to bestow, would place "the
highways in a serviceable condition,Athe
inconvenience complained of would be
the less regretted. But, from the difficul ties
already pointed out, this amuunt of
work, however faithfully executed, would, 4
in many places, be insuliicicnt to effect
the ol-ject. Hence, it often dinppens, .
that the planter has to encounter such.a
wretched slate of the highways, as. to cause
great damage of vehicles and horses,"
and much consumption of time; and, in
many instances, the "bad condition of the
roads presents an utter obstacle to further
progress. It is probable that the induce- jr
rnent which the Legislature, by a late act, .
has held out for the formation of companies,
to establish turnpike roads, will fail
of its purpose, as men cannot be persuad-^
ed to vest money in any enterprise, with- , v
out a fair prospect of a profitable return,
in the shape of interest, or dividends. I
trust your wisdom will be able to devire
some remedy, for those great evils. Be- ^
fore leaving tbe subject, I would recommend
what has already been pressed upon , /
your consideration, by one of my predecessors,
that the Commissioners of the
Roads, throughout the State, should be \
allowed to commute labor, for money, in
all cases where the person liable to road . *'
duty, might prefer it: The money thus
raised, to constitute a fund, to let out, in
contracts, for repairing, and keeping in
repair, certain portions of the roads;
