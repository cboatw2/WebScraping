CULTUKR OK COTTON.
There are many around us, who think,
the surface culture of cotton, or of crops,
a new-fangled notion, nnd spoilt at the
C5 *
idea ; all encroachments or established
usages and customs nro received in this
very way. There are others who think
it has done and will do for the north, hut
will not in the south. I will Riatc one
circumstance, and close by citing one
fact. In 1333, (I think,) I planted in the
some field, about twenty acres of cotton,
?s usual, barred oft', and scraped. The
subsequent culture, was entirely with the
hoe and sweep, the latter merely shaving
the surface, probably ton depth of one half
to one inch?also three acres, and oultivated
as was customary, plowing three
times and hoeing?there was but a path
of 13 to 24 inches, dividing land as near
similar as could be, only the first piece
cleared five years and the 2d only two
years?therefore the latter should have
resisted the drouth best. Mr. Win.
Montgomery, my neighbor, a practical
farmer of some thirty years standing, ridiculed
my not ion,"ns I had been but recently
from school?I took him in the
field to look at il, he admitted the tinplowcd
iand, was the best crop, and had
sustained itself the best through tho season,
but could not account for it. Now
every Gardener knows the fact, that hi*
garden returns him a greater income than
any other spot he can cultivate?the plow
never enters, nor is theoarlh disturbed two
inches from March till July?he culiivntes
the surface entire, having previously
spaded deep and manured well. Then
if this bo so, in reference to raising ve^efab'es
of the top rontcd and horizontal
rooted families in the garden, may it not
i>c well to try' it elsawhere ? especially as
more land can be Cultivated and kept
cleaner.

EFFECTS OF LIMING.
To the F. litor of the Farmer*' Register.
Fairfax County June 16'h, 1339.
My corn which has been made without
the use of the plough, is now throwing
the tassel, and is of the blackest greenj;
very little of it is manured, for the land
was too remote or precipitous thus to be
treated. By the way, I planted two ears
of ? Chinese tice corn," upon land well
manured and limed ; the result wd' prove
it absolutely worthies*; and more Itko a
rush than a tree. My wheat is fine when
compared with crops made upon the same
land without lime. I believe 1 am within
hounds when I say the improvement is
from 50 to 100 per cent. My oats must
make 100 per cent, more than I ever
made without lime. My clover is short,
but I am culling it with a view to seed ;
otherwise I should not cut if. This crop
got uo root last summer, and the spring
was too dry for itn growth. Dear old
Virginia must be resuscitated? and stand
forth io green and gold among her sister*.
The pride of her children gives me
warrant of this result.
I can assure you and your rea !ers that
the use of plaster of Paris after lime,
works strangely and wondm fully. You
may explain why it is so ; for me, it is
sntlicieiit to sec and know that it is so.?
Win re the great father of nature has placed
the limit of fertility, when lime, plaster
and their produce of vegetable matter
is turned back, and reacted upon, time
only will show. 1 shall he greatly disappointed,
if the " far west" docs not find
in the tide-water of Virginia its rival. If
1 live. I shall make some reporl to you on
the subject. 1 am amused to see the
sharp controversy that is going on in the
agricultural papers, ahout the proper application
of manure. My experience of
40 vearsnnd more, authorizes me to say,
that the difference between ploughing it
It, and applying it to She surface is much
like that between " ticcedlc dam^Tu\ lucedie
dec" save that the surface application
only takes half, or less than half, of the
other. Of course it is net so durable, be
of ih? diminished quantity. Uimicc
however, in the mode of application, with
mo, is nut of the question ; for { find that
after collecting my spring and fall supplies
??f oyster shells, and tiic wood necessary
t<? burn I item, I have no choice left; my
manure must go f>tit as we can, not as
wo would. < >ur 11flinthV grass is had, tin.
loss upon limed land, lipon that it is
\ery good.
1 will close this, by rcrrOiJKing (ii.il mv
corn was planted upon a poor field, directly
upon the main southern road, and
luned for public observation. I have not
u?ed piough or coulter in its cultivation.
The plough I have long since disused, as
;? barbarous and inapplicable iinpleinent
far the cultivation of com. The coulter,
J I have, until llio present crop, freely used J
. for tlie early cultivation ; this year we had 1
no heavy rain to hake the ground, and it j

j fatal ?rrnct? or casto* oil o.t a

f " A case has recently occurred in Eng.
; land, in which the death of a horse was;
* \
j evidently produced by the effects of a j
> quart of castor oil given as a purgative. I
j It operated powerfully, but the animal ,
soon died. On examination, a largo inj
trosusceptitn of the jejunum was discovj
erad, and the mucous membrane of the
stomach and ialestinee exhibited marks of j
! severe inflammation.''
I lately met with the above in an old
I number of n medical journal, which
' brought to mind two cases that fell under
j P
I my observation at Lexington, Kentucky,
j in which the death of two valuable horses
! was supposod to have resulted from the
j same article, administered to thorn in
j about the same dose as purgative. Syrup.
torn* of violent intestinal irritation on. j
sued, and after a few days the animals j
died, apparently exhausted by tho power-i
| f'll purging. I should give castor oil to n .

I could procuro any other purgative. It j
is a pity that so little attention is bestow- j
ed upon the disorders of this invaluable |

j posture. On inquiry, I found that tiir j
| tenant who bad left, had always been,'
; what the neiijlibors termed, unfortunate!
i I
in his horses and cattle, and from that \
! cause, more than any other, he had not !
j been ahle to make both ends meet. The
i truth flashed upon me in an instant, and
| # #
! in a verv little time longer than it has tn. i
. ken me to toll you my story, I had com- 1
J nienced pulling flown the stable, the on- !
i healthiness of which had been, I was con- j
winced, the cause of all the cril and nil

; days befure there was not left one stoneupon

j n
ground, removed from wafer and clear
from the shade of trees, with a south-east
j aspect and dry capacious yard ; and from i
i that day 1 have had neither sickness nor i
J sorrow iri my out door household; my!
horses live on less food, are always sleek i
and in good working condition, and my j
' cows arc a credit to their keep; our hut-1
. ter brings two cants mnro in the market,'
I and for the fast year our sales are more j
| than doubled from the same number oft
I cows, and the snrne pasturage; and no j
, more premature calves, instead of wa-'
: tering my cattle, as heretofore, at the j
'spring under the trees?the water cold,!
| with a deadly taste and had color?I sunk j
| a woll^and put in a pump, and at a long |
trough in the yard for the summer, and ,
1 another under shelter for the winter, my j
cattle slake their thirst, without setting up ]
their coats as ther always used to do at", j
ter drinking at the hole under the trees ; >
, even when the weather was warm, they
were accustomed to shake all over as
though they were in a fit of the ague, after
drinking their fill of this water; and
n '
I to this, with the bad aspect of the stables,
I attribute all the sickness and misery !
! which I have experienced amongst nn i
i cattle and horses.
I have been induced to tell you the
! above, by reading in a valuable English

[observation* which would go to show

i' others are attacked by inflammation of
the throat, the lungs or the eyes; most
of them lose tloh rapidls, and tno change j
' produces mmt mischief when it is made in]
the winter season. Horses in constant |
and laborious employment must have good 1 T
lodgings nnd kind treatment; hut where
the stables are had, the management is
seldom good, and it is no exaggeration to j a
say, that hundreds of valuable horses aro ! c<
destroyed every year by the combined it
influence of had stables and bid manage- tl
rncnt. And although excessive toil a rid J 81
bad food have much to do in the work of
destruction, every hostile agont operates '
with moat force where the stables are of j 6(
the worst kind. ! tl
' Stables should always he orected on tl
dry ground or that which will admit of j a
perfect druining, with the surface a little i "
sloping. Stables built in a hollow or on ,r
marshy land are always damp, and when J
the foundation* arc sunk in clay,no drain- 1 ~
ing can keep the walls dry; the dampness j
will follow up the walls from the deepest j ?
foundation. It is true that damp stables
may be rendered less uncomfortable by
strewing the floor with sand or saw.rlu-d,
and, in ?on?e cases, a stove pipe might he ?
made to pass through the stable near the 81
floor,but such stables are liable to frequent
and great alternations of temperature at n
every change of the state of the ntmos- ^
phere. Some of the means usually em- *
ployed agni'ist dampness ;n dwelling a
houses might he adopted in the construction
of stables, go as lo prevent the walls n
from absorbing the moisture of the toil, w
such as a foundation of whinstone to the l'
surface of the ground, covered with a coat P
of Roman cement or a sheet of lead : or j *
'I
the foundation mav he sunk so low as to I
... In
admit of its being laid in coal dust or oth- P
er substance which docs not absorb water; ?
and, although precautions of this kind s
may sometimes prove salutary, they ought a
not to be trusted to where a dry, airv,
healthy situation can he obtained: Ire-( 0
qucntly whitewashing the walls with
lime seems to have an influence in rcinov. j>
mg moisture and keeping them dry. The | "
owuci of a damp and uncomfortable sta- 1
hie often wonders why so innny of his v
horses catch cold; "there are always
some of them coughing." Now, if he c
were lo make that stable his abodo for v
four-nnd twenty hours, he would have but
littlo to wonder at. Largo stables are 0
I
objrctionnble, and have nothing to recom.
mend them but cheapness in the erection, !
so that when it is more important to have J ^
a cheap than a healthy stable, a Urge one j

the height of about -400 feet, and covering a space ?|
larger than a common mile race track of about j
230 acres of ground. Upon its surface there are j j,
several excavations or pits, one of which would ' ^
hold several hundred hogsheads of water, from ' ^
which there may under a peculiar state of the at- j ^
mosphcrc exhalations escape and explode, doubt- I r
less giving rise to the traditions of its emitting ' ^
light. The only evidences of the pilgrimage and j
worship of the Indians were the innumerable I r(
amount of deeply worn trails approaching in from ! tj
every valley and plain, and the small pieces of j 0
loose rocks and pebbles found upon its top. , ^
This rock is composed almost entirely of a dark I rj
colored mica, and it is probably to the reflection of (i
the rays of the sun or moon from the numerous tl
glassy surfaces of the scales of mica, that the bril- '
liant appearance of the rock is attributable."

M While charging horses, we were not a little
entertained at the citrous group formed Ly r(

; both cordially partaking of .a largo, o

on the road ; and, indeed, throughout Swe 0

subsistence of the peasantry. Before setting i 1
out on a journey, a few of these cakes are 1 ^
strung together, which serve for the support
of themselves and their horses. As the latter r(
may sometimes belong to three or even four v
proprietors, it is highly amusing on the road, ^
to observe the frequent altercations between
them, each endeavouring to sparp his own

riven beyond their strength. Indeed, the j
xpcditlon with which these little animals prosed
is surprising when we consider the'
dullness of their size, which hardly exceeds | 1

iilcd on licr regular day, the 19tb of November, i
She. experienced tremendous westerly gales du- j i
ng the whole passage, but sustained no damage. [
it the time we had the severe gale from the j,
Eastward, she was between the longitude of 45 i

Cotton closed at the latest dates without mate-!

tic Acadia there was a large business, and full I
rices were obtained for middling descriptions of
American?speculators taking about 3500 ba'e-.
.'be succeeding wcok. ending 18th November, rcortsof
probability of the good crops on this side
f the water checked speculation, but the trade
till bought freely. Tae sales of the two weeks
mounted to 59,ti00 bales.
The new American tariff has occupied no in. ,
onsiderablc degree of public attention of lute, and
lie increased stagnation of trade is attributed in a
Teat degree to its operations. The general opinsn
in this country is that it has failed to produce
be beneficial results to the American government
irhich its promoters had anticipated, and that un
;ss it be speedily repealed, a good deal of British
apital heretofore engaged in American commerce
rill be in future invested in other channels.
As one of the effects produced by the opera4ion
f the new tariff, we may mention that, on 8 ituray
last, the packet-ship Columbia sailed hence ?
ar New York, with a freight the value of which
id not amount to more than 18i) pounds.

jomlon. A few hours before his departure, he had
n audience of I/mis Philippe to take leave. The
iing, in tiie kindest terms, expressed his regret j
t the departure of the General, and insured him |
tat during the whole period of his olficial rcsi- j
lvicc in Paris, the relations between them had/
ccn such as to give constant satisfaction to his
I ijesly. i\Ir. Lcdyard, the son-in-law of General
'as*, remains in Paris as the charge d'affaires.? I
>n the day previous to the departure of the Geneil,
a dinner was given to him by about a hundred
uncrican residents in Paris. Mr. Beasley, the
Lincrican consul at Havre, as the oldest official
^preventative of the United States in Paris, was in
ic chair. The chairman, in proposing the health !
f their guest, congratulated him 0:1 his exertions j
lit he made against the quintuple treaty for the I

lanks, repeated some of the objections to that j
cafy, which lie had already made in print.

On tlic other hand, the Mexicans have manifested

on the complexion of the late advices from
the theatre of war in Texas, will agree witli us in
thinking that the operations of General Wollcxhi.
bit considerable improvement in tactics. We find t
that lie has partly, if not altogether, overcome the ,
superiority derived from skill in shooting the rifle, (
by furnishing the Mexican battalions with artillc- ,
rists and howitzers, the fire from which so thins
the ranks of the assailants, as to render any ad.
vancc of the l itter extremely dangerous, whenever
made in the presence of hostile cavalry of superior
force. In consequence, the Texans will be coin,
pelted to bring artillery into the field, improve the ,
discipline of their infantry, and increase the number
of their cavalry, before they inav hope for sue- t
cess in any other contest than mere skirmishing
and bush fighting."

News from Mexico.?Toe U. S. war steamer,
Missouri, C'apt. Newton, arrived off tlic Balizc
I
early on Tuesday morning, in three days and a
half from Vera Cruz. Site brought as passengers 1
Mr. P. A. Southall, bearer of despatches from the '
American Minister at Mexico, Gen. Thompson,
to tlic government at Washington, and also six of 1
the S.nta Fe prisoners.
We have not been able to learn the character 1
of the despatches brought by .Mr. Southall, but *
from private letters based upon reports which '
were in circulation in Mexico, upon good authori. (
ty, prior to the departure of the Missouri, we have 1
reason to believe that all our pending difficulties
in relation to claims of American citizens will lie 1
most satisfactorily arranged, upon terms coinpati. '
!?!< with the honor and interest of our country. (
Our letters tell us tli it the flower of the army
had been either sent to Yucatan or to such points in 1
the department of Vera Cruz as would enable Gen. *
Santa Anna to avail himself of the power of well. c
trained troops, if the occasion should require.
It was generally believed in .Mexico that Santa
Anna was opposed to all the projects for a new
constitution projjoscd by the Constituent Congress, '
all of which were federal in their character. If ?
such were really the ease he would, by thus retiring
from the actu d administration of affairs, have |
the opportunity of returning at a moment's notice <
to the capital with an overwhelming force, and de- |
straying the constitution when promulgated, or, of J
shielding himself by flight, in a few hours, through j
Vera Cruz, from the enmity with which he knows |
he is regarded throughout the republic. I
Those who have the best opportunity of judging j
regard Mexico at present as in a inost critical |
position, and possibly upon the eve of another re. /
volution. There is no doubt that the new consti- |
tution will be a fcderul one. I
On the arrival of the news at the city of Mcxi- <
co of the taking of San Antonio, and the capture j
of Van Ness, Fitzgerald, and others, belonging to ]
the Santa Fc expedition, it is said that an order |
was sent on to shoot all such recaptured prisoners i
on the spot. Through the interference of General j
Torncl, however, this order was countermanded, |
and Van Ness, Fitzgerald, and such others as were
known to be in the expedition, had their sentence
commuted to ten years' imprisonment in the castle ^
of Pcrote, one of the coldest and most disagreeable |
places in the country.

was commuted to imprisonment during the pleasure

An express had arrived from the Mexican army

L'ruz and the capital, but no news was communi:ated,
and nothing was known at Vera Crtn tof
iny belligerent operations about Campeachy.?
There had, indeed, been a low rumor that the

WcdnesJay list, hut having received it only this
morning, wc are unable to gratify our readers with
its perusal this week. Wc subjoin tlic following
extract from the remark# of tlic Notional Intelligencer
on this important <!ocumcnt:?
44 It is to us a source of real satisfaction to din.
cover in the Mrssigc of the President to Congress,
wo much to approve and so little to cond< inn.
>? c nave iouiki 11, upon me insry consicrrutiou
we have been able to give to it, of greater intercut
than we anticipated, and little exceptionable in its
general tone and spir f.
We cannot indeed regard the state of public
affaire with the same complacency an tlx: I'rcnu
dent, who perceives in it nothing but motives for
congratulation upon the present condition and
prosjiccts of the country. Reverencing profoundly
those wise and free institutions of which he speak*,
we wish we could realize his vision of the rapid
advancement of the United States towards the
consummation of the high destiny which Provi.
denoe seems to have marked out for than. Vet, *
far from advancing, the progress of the country to.
wards its high destiny?to be attained only through
the greatest happiness of the greatest number, the
true object of all good government?has been lor
several years past backwards rather than forwards,
ir at best but stationary. For lite exemption
which we enjoy from the fate of such other nations
is arc either torn to pieces by internal commotions,
>r engaged in bloody conflict with each other, we
icknowlcdgc the debt of gratitude which we owe
to the great Ruler of the Universe. But we can.
lot, in the face of all that we know of the present
depressed and suffering condition of a large portion
>f the population of this land, bring ourselves to
xlieve that the present condition of the internal
iffuirs of the country is cither enviable in itself, or
>y any means such as under a wise administration
)f the public affaire it might have been.
We unite, however, with entire cordiality and
sincerity, in the congratulations which the Prcsilent
offers to his fellow.citizcns upon die happy
rhange, within the last year, in the aspect of our
foreign Affairs.
Tur. Bankiutt Law.?The following extract
rom the correspondence of the Journal of Cam,
neree will be read with startling interest by many i
44 The fate of the Bankrupt Act is sealed. It if
to be repealed, condemned, repudiated, in a viol.
?nt and vindictive manner. The instructions to
the Vermont Senators hive settled the question.
Mo regular course of legislation is to be tolerated
in regard to this ill-fated law. It is not to he re.
gularly annulled, but it is to be Lynched. It is to
lie tried by Lynch law and expunged. The plan
is to present a petition for its repeal?to move a re.
fcrcnce to the petition in the House to the conu
mitt .c on the judiciary, wiih iro tractions forthwith
to bring in a bill repealing the act, and tlicn th.?
bill is to be passed at once through all the stages
if legislation, und?r the decision made by (to
Speaker at the last session. Some say thftt the
President will veto this repealing bw. Many express
an ardent hope that he wiH do so. Some of
lhe ultra.Whigs say thai if he will, they will take
this veto as a set-off against the bank and distnb^
tion vetoes."
