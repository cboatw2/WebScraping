lsportWt Spoeeck by Sir Robert Peel, re. si
spectuig the Uniter States. II
In the Houseor Commons on Thursday, ti
the first night or thie semion. Sir It. Peal si
made the fullowiug speech relative to the c
United States, which we deem an impor. w
i tant that we give it entire. He commen- ct
ced by referring to the remarks of the w
preceding speaker, (31r. C. Wood) re- 8
specting the boundary treaty, and express- ej
ing hi6 pleasure at the settlement of that ol
question, said, that no other advantage no
could be compared with an amicable set- (I
iement between two nations of kindred
origin,.of kindred language. and or inter- of
ests as kindred as their origin and lan- So
guaie. The rightilon. baronet then pro- es
ceoded as follows : cc
I rejoice that the hon. genleman has ul
given me as opportunity of making some ci
observations on the late message of the it
President of the United Ststes. The sin- n<
care and bnmest desirt I have always en- 91
sertained for the naintainanuce of a good 8
undersiandisg between this country and M
the United States, and the spirit in which Iiin
I have always spoken of America, makes 31
it a doubly painful duty io atte to have to A
refer to that mesage, which, I ,amn sorry ti
to say, does not give a correct account of ri
the negotiations relatii'e to the right of "
visit.
Peramps I may do right to confirat what 's
thue honorable gentleman has said, that C
there is nothing more distinct than the a'
right of visit is from the right of search. ol
Search is a belligerent right, and not to al
i be exercised ins time of peaee except *hen vi
I it has been concedled by treaty. The right it
-of search estends not only to the vessel, al.
but to the cargo also. The right of visit ci
is guit. distinct from this, though the two
are often cnfonded. st
The right of search, ,vith respect to i
A mericaa vessels, we entirely and literally a
disclaim; nay, more, if we knew that an ;
American vessel wore furnished *ith all n.
the materials requisite for tlee slave tradea
if we knew that the dechs were prepared te
to receive hundredsi of human beings,witha- ;e
