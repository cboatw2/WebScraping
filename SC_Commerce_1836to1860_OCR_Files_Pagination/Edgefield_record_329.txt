M EMlSAGE.
Fellow Citesens of the Senate & I. of Rcprsen.
I regret that I cannot On1 1t4 occasion
congrailate you that the past year has
been one of unalloyed prosperity. The
rvage< of the fire and disease h-sve pain
fully afflicted otherwise flourishing portions
of our country, & serious einharrassments
yet derange the trade of many ofouir cities.
But,nol withstanding these ad verse cirenin
stances. that general prosperity which has
been heretofore so bonntifully bestowed
tipon us by the Author of all good, still
continues to call for our warmest grat
itude. Especially have we reason to re
joice in the exuberant harvests which inve
lavishly recontoensed welt directed indus
try, and given ti it that sure reward which
is vainly sought in visionary speenatitions.
I cannot inderd view without peculiar sat
isfaction. the evidences anrorded by the
past season of the benefits that spring from
the steady devotion of the husbaudman to
his honorable pursuit. No means of in- I
dividual comfort is more certain, nnd no
mource of national prosperity is so sure.
Nothing @an conpensate a people for a
dependence upon others for the bread they
cat: and that cheerful abundance on which
the happiness of every one so much de-I
pends. is to be looked for nowhere iih
so sure reliance as in the industry of the
agriculturist and the bounties Of the earth.
With froreign countries, our relations ex
hibit the same favorable aspect which was 1
presented in my last annual message, and
alord rontinued proof of the wisdom of
the pacific.ju,;t, and torhearing policy adop
ted 1y the first Administration of the Fed
eral Government, and pursued by its sne
cessors. The extraordinary powers ve
led in me by an act of Congress, for the i
defence of the country in an emiergency,
considered so far probable as to require i
that the Executive should possess ample
means to meet it. have not been exerted.
They have, th -refore, been attetded with
no other resul than to increase, tby the
confidence thus reposed in me, my ob
ligations to maintain, with religious ex
actness, the cardinal principles %that go
vern our intercourse with other nations.
Happily, in our pending questions with
Great Britian, out of which this tnusual
grant of authority arose, nothing has oc
curred to require its exertion: and -s it is
about to return to the Le.-islature. I trust 4
that no future necessitv nmy call for its 4
exercise by them, oritselelegation to anoth
er de-partment of the Government.
For-the settlemen of our North Fas- I

by Great Britsin for a commisito of , x

and a counter pIjct. inriuding also a
provision for the certain and final ndjiust

the Britisia Government for its considera
tion. A just regard to the delicate state 4
of this question, and a proper respect ror f
the natural impatience of the State of r
Maine, not less than a conviction that the
negotiation has b.een already protracted r
longer itan is prudent on the part of either t
Government htave led me to believe that th- I
present favorable mtottient should on no r
necount be sulTered to pas without pit
ting the question forever at test. I feel r
confident that the Government of her t
Britannic Majesty will taike thesame view c
of itis subject. a I anm persuadedl it is I
governted by desires eqiually itrono and t
sincere for the amicable termination ofthe t
controversy.
To the intrinsic diffenilties of questions
of houndary lines, especially those describ- t
ed in regions uniccupieI. nn rit p:trtially
known, is to be added in our country the r
Cnbarrassiment necessarily arrising out of t
our Constittition, by w hich the tieneral 1
Government is made the organ of negocia- j
ting, and decidinig upon the particularm in-.
terests of the States on whose frontiers
these lines are to lie traced. To avoid
another controversy itn which a State
Government might rightfully claim to 12
have her wishes consnlted, previously to
tbe conclusion of courenttional arrange- I
tmerts concerning hter rights of jieriletion
or territory, I have thotitht it necesarym io
call the attention of thme Governmnent of
Great Britatin to another portion oif sitr
conatermoinfus dosmitnitn, ot " hieh the dli
vision still rettainb to beC adjusted. I refer
to the line from thbe entrance of Lake Smu- I

ill conviction stronely opposed to all iO
ternedling with the internal affairs of our
nei-lhbors. The people of the U. States
reel, as it is hoped they always will, a
warm solicitude for the success of al! who
,re sincerely endeavoring Io impr.ove the
political conditiou of inankind. The gen
'rous feeling they cherish towards niost
listant nations: and it was natural, there
ore, that it should be awakened with more
han common warmth in behalf of their
mmttniediate neighbors. But it does not be
ong to their character, as a conmitumity.
o seek the gratification of those feelings in
ets % hich violate their duty as citizens,

'or a momeut to lose sight of the pertna

Frot all the information I receive, con
irmed to some extent by personal obser
ation, I am satisfied that noone can hope
o en-trage in such enterprises without en
ounterii pnhtic inliganation. in addition
o the severest penalties of the law.
Recent information also leaads me to
iope that the enigrants frotn her Majes
v's Provinces, who have sought reftuge
iitthin our bouttdaries. are disposed to he
!ome peaceable residents, and to abstain
rom attempts to endantger the peace of
htat country which has alrded thetm an
sylum. On a review of the occurrences
mn both sides of the line, it is satisfactory
o reflect that in altost every complaint
gatinst otr country, the offence may be
raced to emigratnts from the Provinces
vho have sought refuge here. In the few
t-tatces in which they were aided by citi
ens of the U. States, the acts of these
utasguided taen were nat only in direct
ontravention of the laws and well known
vishes of their own Government, btt tnet
vith the decided disapprobation of the
Jited States.
I regret to state the appearance of a dif
brent spirit among her Majesty's subjects
a the Canadas. The sentiments of hos
ility to our people anal institutions which
tave been so freqnently expressed there,
nd te disregarl of our rights which have
een manifested on some occasions, have
am sorry to say, been applauded and et
,ouraced by itle people, and even by some
of the subordiimnte local authorities, of the
rovinces. The chief officers in Canada
ritnutely have not entertained the same

just to them, was deemed less oneruus and
inconvenient to the Mexican Government.
Relying confidently upon the intentions of
that Government, ir. Ellis was directed
to repair to Mexico, and diplomatic inter
conrse has been resumed betwen the two
countries. The new conventionf has. he

President of that Republic to ir Congress,

allow myvself to doubt.
instructions have been given to the
Commissioner or the United States under
our Convention with itexas, for the demar
cation of the line which separates us from
that Republic. The commissioners of
both Governments met in New Orleans in
Augtust last. The joint commission was
organized, and adjourned to convene at the
same place on the twelfh, of October. It
is presumed to be now in the performance
of its duties.
The new Government of Texas hae

has been concluded for lie renewal of its
former treafy with the United States.
This was not ratified before the departure
of our late Charge d'Affaires from that
country, and the copy of it brought by him
was not received before the adjournment
of the Senate at thefast session. In the
mean while, the period limited for the ex
change of ratifications having expired, I
deemed it expedient, in consequence of
the death ofthe.Charge d'AfTaires, tosend
a special agent to Central America, to
close the affairs of our mission there, and
to arrange with the Government an exten
sion of the time for the exchange of ratifi
cations.
The commission created by the States
which formerly composed the'Republic of

fully carried into executlion, and that
e!Ouistry in the enjoyment of tranquility, is
radually advancing in prnsperity. under

rhe financial operations of the govern
ment during the present year have. I ,m
happy to say, been very successfuil. The
difficulties under which the Treasury De

ig of the pubelic moneys, agnravated by
the stuspension of specie paymtents by sev
erael of the banks holding peublic deposites,
or inidebed to pulicw oliiteas for ncores r
ceived itn patymtent of public dices, have
beent surmounted to a very gracifying ex
tent. The large current expenditures
have been puually met, and the faith
of the Gozeverniment, in all ics pecucciary
concerms, has been scruplulouslyt mi
taine-d.
The nin-teen mnillions of TreasuryNotes
authorized by the act oflConcgress of 18.17,
and the moadifications thereof, with the
view ti the indulgence of mcerchants on
thceir dutty boends, and 01 the deposite
bunks itn the payment of public moneys
held by them, have been eo puuctutally re
deemne'd as to leave less titan the original
tea millions out standing at amy otne titme,
and the whole amnoumi uinredeetmed now
falls short of three mailliotns- Of these the
chief portion is not due till next year, andl
the whale wvonlh have beetn aclreadv extina
guished could the Treascury have ~re:dized
the payments dlue to it by the banks. If.
those due from chemt durintg the next year
,hIall he puner uaally made, and if Cniczres
shlol keelp the appropriationcs within the
'stimcatec, there is every reason to believe
that all the outstaciding Treascury notes
can he redeemed arid the ordinary expen
ses defrayed, withcout imposing on the
people aney addiuionial buirdlen, either of
loans or increase.l taxes.
To avoid this, andl to keep the expen
diures wvithinc reasoinable bounds, it is a
duty, second only in importanuce to the
preservatioen of our natiotnaleharacter,atcd
the protection elf our: ciizens in t'heir
civil and political rights. The creation,
in time of pence. oif a debt likely tel be
comco permanent. is an evil for whcich
there is no equivalcnt. The rap)idity with
wbicb mrnyn of thc Stts are annarentl.
ai-proaching to this condition, admonishes
ns of our own duties, in a manner too im
pressive to be disregarded. One not the
least important, is to keep the Federal
Government always in a condition to dis
charge,with ease & vigor, its highest func
tions, should their exercise be required by
any sudden conjuncture of public affairs
a condition to which we are always ex
posed, and which may occur when it is
least expected. Tothisend, it isindispen
sable that its finar.ees should be untram
meled, and its resources, as far as practi
cable, uninconmhered. No circumstance
could present grenter obstacles to the ac
complishment of these vitally important
objects,than the creation of an onerous na
tional debt Our own experience and also
that of other nations, have demnonstrated
the unavoidable and fearful rapidity with
which a public debt is increased, when the
Government has once surrendered itselrto
the ruinous practice of supplying its sup
posed necessities by new loans. The
struggle. therefore, to be successful must
be made at the threshold. To make our
efibrts efective, severe economy is neces
sary. This is the surest provision for the
national welfare; and it is, at the same
time, the best preservative of the principles
on which our institutions rest. Sitnplici
ty and economy in the affairsof state have
never failed to chasten and invigorate Re
publican principles, while these have been
as surely subverted by national prodigali
ty under whatever spcious pretexts it may
have been introduced or fostered.
These considerations cannot he lost up
on a people who have never been inatten
tive to the elect of their policy upon the
inqtitutons they have created for them
selves; but at the present moment their
force is augmented by the necessity which
a decreasing revenue must impose. The
check lately given to importation of arti
cles subject to duties, the derangements
in the operations of internal trade, and
especially the reduction gradually taking
place in our tariff of duties, all tend mate
rially to lessen our receipts; indeed it is
probable that the diminution resulting from
the last cause alone, will not fall short of
five millions of dollars in the year 1842, as
the final reduction of all duties to twenty
per cent. then takes effect. The whole
revenue then accruing from the customs,
and from the sales of public lands, if not
more, will undoubtedly he wanted to de
fray the necessary ex penses of the Govern
ment under the most prudet administra
tion or its affairs. These are cirrumstan
ces that impose the necessity orri!id econ
ormy, aid efluire its prompt and constant
exercise, With the Legislatute rest the
power and duty ofso adjusting the public
expenditure as to promote this end. By
the provisions of lie Conststution, it is only
in consequence of appropriations made by
law. that money can be drawn from the
Treasury; no instance has orcurred since
the establishment of the Government in
n bich the Executive, though a component
part of the Legislative power. has inter
posed an objection to an appropriation bill
on the sole grond or its extravagance.
Ilii dttty in this respect has been consider
ed ulfiled by requesting such appropria.
tions only as the ptuhlic service may be
reasonably expected to require. In the
present earnest direction of lhe public mind
towards this subject, both the Executive
and the Legislature have evidence or the
strict respontsibility to which they will be
held; and while I atn conscious of my own
anxious elorts to perform with fidelity
ihis portion of my .ptldic functions, it is a
satisfaction to me to be able to count on a
cordial co-operation from you.
At the time i entered upon my present
duties our ordinarv disbursements-with
out includitig those on aecoinut of the ptub
hie debt, the post oiftce, and the trust funds
in charge of the Governietnt--had been
largely increased by appropriat ions for the
remtoval of the Indians, for repelling In
dian hostilities, and for other less urgent
expenses which grew otut of an overflow
intg treasttry. I ndependen t of the redemp
tion of the public debt and trusts, the gros
expenditures of seventeen or eighteen mil
lions itt 1834 and .1835 had, hv these cans
es,swelled tohtwentv-nine millions in 1836;
and the appropriations for 1q37, mnade
previously to the fourth of. March, caused
the expetnditures to rise to thte very large
amount of thirty.-three millioni. We wei-e
etnabled' dturing the year 18'38, notwith
staniditng the continuance of our Indian
emibarrassmenits,. somew hat to reduce this
amnount; and that for the present year,
1839, will not itt all probability exceed
twveuty-six tmillions--or six millions less
than it was last year. With a determing
tion so far ne depends tin me to continue
this reduetion. I have directed the estimates
fur 1840 to be subjected to the severest
seruitiny. andl to 1,e limited to the absolute
requirements of the pubtic service. They
will be tiound less than the expeBnditures of
1839 by over five millions of dollars.
'The precautionasry measures which will
he reconmentded by the Secretary of the
Tlretsury, to prnteet r~titrrlly the public
credit tiuder the flunctuations and contin
gentes to wvhich ouir receip~ts and expen
dituges are exposttd. and especially in a
comitmetrcial crisis like the present,are com
mended to your early atmerntion.
On a tormer occasion your attention was
invited to variotne considerationis itt support
of a prf'eemptionl lasv in behalf of the set
tIers on the public lands; and also of a law
graduating the prices forsuch lands as had
long~ been in the market utnsold, in conse
quence of thteir inferior qtuality. The exe
cution of the act which passed on the first
snhject, has been attended wvith the happi
est consequences, in quieting titles, and se
,,riem improvemnts to tho industrious;
and it has also, to a very gratifying ex
tent. been exempt from the frauds wbieb
were practised under previous pre-emp
iion laws. It has, at the same time, as
was anticipated, contributed liberally du
ring the present year to the receipts of the
Treasury.
The passage of a graduation law, with
the guards before recommendedwould also
I am persuaded, add condsiderably to the
revenue for several years, and prove in
other respects just and hanefiltaL
Your early consideration of the subject
is, therefore, once more earnestly re
quested.
The present condition of the defencesof
our principal seaports and navy yards, as
represented by the accompanying reports
of the Secretary of War. calls for the early
and serious attention of Congress; and, as
connecting itself intimately with this sub
jert, I cannot recommend too strongly to
your consideration the plan submitted by
that officer for the organization of the mili
r of the United States.
In conformity with theexpressed wishes
of Congress, an attempt was made in the
spring to terminate the Florida war by
negotiation. It is to be regretted that these
humane intentions should have been frus
trated, and that the etfort to bring these un
happy difficulties to'a satisfactory conelu
sion should have failed. But, after entering
into solemn engagements with the Com
manding General, the Indians, without
any provacation, recommenced their acts
of treachery and murder. The renewal
of hostilities in that Territory renders it
necessary that I should recommend to your
favorable consideration the plan which
will be submitted to you by the Secretary
of War, in order to enable that department 1
to conduct them to a successful issue.
Having had an opportunity of persotr
ally inspecting a portion of the troops du
ring the last summer, it gives me pleasure 4
to bear testimony to the success of the ef- i
fort to improve their discipline, by keeping
them toget her in as large bodies as the na
ture of our service will permit. I recom
tnend therefote, that commodious and per- I
mtanent barracks be constructed at the 1
several posts designated by the Secretary of I
war. Notevithstanding the high state of i
their discipline and excellent police, ihe 4
evils resulting to the service from their i
deficiency (ifcompany officers, were very
apparent, and I recommend that the stalff
officers be permanently separated from the
line.
The nayy has been usefully and hou
orably employed in protecting the rights
and property of our citizens, wherever the
condition of atlairs seemed to require its 1
presence. With theexception of one in
st;.nce, where an outrage, accompanied
by murder, was committed on a vessel of
the United States while engaged in a law- i
ful commerce, nothing is known to have i
occurred to impede or molest the enterprise
of our citizens on that element where it I
is so signally displayed. On learning this i
daring act of piracy, Commodore Reed i
proceeded immediately to the spot, and I
receiving no sati-faction, either in the sur
render of the murderers or th.- restoration i
of the plundered property, iuflicted severe i
and merited chastisement on the barba- i
rians.
It will he seen by the report of the Sec- 1
retary of the Navy respecting the disposi- I
ti.n of our ships of war. that it has been
deemed necessary to station a competent I
force on the coast of Africa, to prevent a !
fraiduleht use of our flag by foreigners.
Recent experience has shown that the i
provisions in our existing laws which re
late to the sale and transfer of American. I
vessels while abroad, are extremely defec i
tive. Advantage has been taken of these I
defects to give to vessels belonging to i
foreigners, and navigating the ocean, an I
apparent A merican ownership. This char
acter has been so well stimulated as to
afford them comparative security in pros
ecuting the slave trade, a traffic enmph ati-f
cally denonnced in our statutes, regarded i
with abhorrence by our citizens, and of
whieb the effectual suppression is no
wvhere more sincerely desired thana in the<
17. States. These c'ircumstances make it
proper to recommend to your early atten
tion a careful revision of these laws, so
that, without impeding the freedom atnd
lacilities of our natvigattion, or impairing aI
branch of our industry connected with it,
the inteerity and honor of our fiae may bei
careflIly preservedi, information derived
form our Consul at Havana, showing the
necessim y of this, was communicated to a
comtnittee of the Senate near the elbee of<
the last session, but too late, as it appeared
to be acted upon. It will he brought to
your notice by the proper department,
with additional communications fromnother
sources.

two hundred anud forty-one thousand fie
hundred and sixty dollars. The engage
ments and liabilities of the Departmenti
for the same period are four million six
hundred and taventy four thousand one
hundred andl seventeen dollars.
The excess of liabilities over the: re
venue for the last two years has beenniet

accumulated. The cash on hand on theI
thirtieth ultimo, was about $206,701 59.
and the current income of the Department
varies very little front ihe rate of current
expenditures. Mostof these -vice suspen
ded last year has been restored, and most
of the new routes esiablished by the act of
7th July, 1838, has been set in operation
at an annual cost of 3436.963. Nothwith
stand the pecuniary difficulties of tlbe coun
try, the revenue of the Department ap.
pears to be hierenkAg; and unless it shall
he seriously checked by the recent suspen
sion of payment by so many of the banks,
it will be able not only to maintain the
present mail service, but in a short time to
extend it. It is gratifying to witness the
promptitude and fidelity with which the
agents l thi; Department in general per
form their public duties.
Som1'e diflicubies have arisen in relation to
contracts for the transportation-ofthe mails
by railroad and steam boat companies. Is
appears that the maxiun of compensation
provided by Congress for the transportation
of the mails upon railroads, is not sufficient
to induce sonie of the companies to convey
them at ouch houra as aue required for the
accommodation of the public. It is one of
the most important duties of the General
Government to provide and maintain for
[he use of the people of the States the best
practicable mail establishment. To ar
rive at that end it is indispensable that the
Post Office Department shall be enabled
to control the hours at which the mails
shall be carried over railroads, as it now
Ines over all other roads. Should serious
nisconveniences arise from the inadeqoney
)f the compensation now provided by law,
r from unreasonable dettmandsi by any of
he rail road companies, the subjects i' of
iuch general importance as to require the
eminpt attention of Congress.
In relation to -team bna; lines, the most
ficient remedy is obvious, and has been
iuggested by the Po-master General.
rhe W ar and Na vy Departments ilready
)mploy steumti boals in their service, and
alihough it is by no means desirable that
be Governments should undertake the
ran,piirtation of passengers or freight as a
lusiness, there can lie no reasonable objee
ion to running boats, temporarily, when
tver it may be necessary to put down at*
empts at extortion, to he discontinued as
toon as reasonable contracts can be oh.
tained.
The suggestions of the Postmaster Ceu.
eral relative to the inadequacy of the Is
gal allowance to witnesses in cases of
prosecutions for mail depredations, merit
)ourserious consideration. The safety of
the mails requires that such prosecutions
ihall be efficient, and justice to the citizen
whose time is required to lie given to the
iublic, demtands not only that his expenses
dhall he paid. but hat he shall receive a
reasonable compensation,

From a report made in December of
