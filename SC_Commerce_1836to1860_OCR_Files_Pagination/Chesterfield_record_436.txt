on Friday (12th.) and in South
Carolina, durijgg the aewion.of the legislature.
In all the states except S. Carolina,
the election is by general ticket.
The President is now on a visit to
New York and the Secretary of State is
on a visit to Georgia. Some of the Whigs
are ungenerous enough to clmrgo them
with tlto design of choosing this particular
time to visit their homes, with a view
of exerting some influence on the election
for President in their respective states.?
Others hint that they have only been induced
by the result of recent state clections
.to visit their domicils to make arrangements
for expected "retiracy" in the
spring.
Much excitement has just been produced
in the city of New York, first by
the Democrats charging the Whigs with
importing persons to vote at the New
York elections; and then hy the Whigs
alleging tiutt leading Democrats hud
lbrtiuHl a conspiracy to lix upon them so
base a charge. Numerous atladavits have
been published by l>oth parties, from all
wiiicit it seems tlml the Wnigs, suspectnig
that the Democrats were ultoiit to int.
port voters from Philadelphia to New York
in 1W3M and '3D employed men from different
parts of Philadelphia to go on to
New Y.?rk and attend tlio polls on the
days of election in the different wards of
the city, for the purpose of identifying
and challenging such imported voters
should they present themselves. One of the
men employed by the New York Whigs to
engage these spies, named Stevenson,
luleiy reported to leading D mix*rats that
what he was employed to do was to procure
voters and not spies, and that several
men of great respectability in both cities
were implicated. IPs statement was published
with his o.trft, affirming its truth.
The Dt inocrats, from Boston to Baltimore,
if not to Richmond, were now in
ecstucics- Taey had prr>o/'of the corruption
which they had so long charged upon
the "Ifriiish Federal Whigs." 1>i Boston
u hand lull was issued from the office
of a Ic-ndii g party paper, announcing
the important and gratifying in intelligence,
and stating that Ciov. Heward of
New York had been arrested for participation
in tiic corruption, and that Mr.
( rinncll, m- miter id Congress, and some
one else had runaway to escape arresf.
As soon us the publication of the Democrats
was made, all the Whigs implicated,
among whom was the Mayor of Philadelphia,
contradicted, on oath, in the
public papers, the statements of Stevenson
At this stage of the business a fellow
named Wentwortb, who had also been
employed in the work of procuring spies
from Philadelphia, publishes on oath a
statement that Mr. Butler, Mr. Iloyl the
collector of New York, and others hud offered
him money, with the promise of office
frmn the President, if he would implicate
(lov. Seward and other leading
Wiiigs in the charge of hiring voters front
Philadelphia. 'I'm* tuition I
ed, iii tlic estimation at least oftlic Whigs.
Tucy consider no language too strong to
characterize so base a conspiracy among ,
men high in ottice to blast the character of
honorable and honest men, and hv
vile falsehood and purjury to att'ce%
and if t'ioy could, decide, the election of
of Chief magistrate for this Republic, or
rather for this august Confederacy of Republics.
Rut the triumph of the Whigs
was as brief as bud been tliut of their opponents.
It appears now, from the testimony of
men more entitled to credit than Wentworll?so
far from being ottered a brilie
of either money or ottice, he asked for one
or both, as a price for which he would reveal
to the Democrats the evil practices
in which he alleged that he had himself
been engaged as the servant of the Whigs;
and thut when the bribes were refused, he
refused to divulge the important secrets.
The matter is still undergoing investigation,
and likely to end in smoke; and at
(lie same time to show that lioth parties
uro more ready to (inspect their opponents
ol* unfairness and corruption than
truth justifies.

The Red .1 Ten.?We noticed on Sunday
the arrival here of a nuinhcr of IT. S.
officers and troops destined for Florida,
and accompanied by a number of Seminole
and Mieasuky chieftains.
These chieftains arc the mast distinguished
men of their different tribes, and are
selected to present to their brethren in
Florida the enviable condition of those
who have emigrated. They arc not over
sanguine in their anticipations, but arc
confident that they can persuade their re
lativesat least to emigrate to Arkansas. It
is mast profoundedly to he wisher] that the
expedition will prove successful in its cnteprise.

More Indian Depredations.?A party of
Indians showed themselves at Col. Gamble's
plantation at Wclaunee, in Jefferson
County, on Saturday last. They tired
upon a negro man, wounding him in tlte
hand, who effected his escape. They took
a negro woman, and forced her to accompanythem.
But l>cing surprised by meeting
a party of whites, they fled precipitately,
and the woman effected her escape.?
The humbugs were some few miles distant,
watching the progress of the election.

The l??t accounts fr<?m Europe havo pit
an cflR-clual check to shipincuts of both wheat
and Flour. The duty has advanced so high,
that no more will go forward, until some change
of price takes place.
Wheat, the great staple of the middle States,
is now selling in this market at prices under a

there has been a period within the last twenty

Among others, the great village of Akhouli

Above one thousand inhabitants were buried
