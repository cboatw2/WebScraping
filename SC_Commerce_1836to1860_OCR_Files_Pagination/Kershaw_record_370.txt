of perioilic.il and fugitive literature of the

the dross from the tine gold, and to present a compendium,
which, like gaud wine, shall he heightened
in value by age, and be, in the language of our
motto, " perennial and flagrant." i
Of course it will but require a proper exercise of
taste to render a magazine, formed on this plan, the .
richest depository of elegant and entertaining literature
ever published, and this wc seriously mean the
' Evergreen" shall be; fur we are quite sure wo have
the materials to render it s.?. We can hoast of a
more brilliant list of contributors thin any cantemporaneous
prriodie.il, as in iv be seen by glancing
at the contents of our present number. Indeed,
there is no author honorably known to f.u::e in these j
or any former times, to uli j?e productions we do not j
have access. We shall always aim, however, at
presenting what is new and comparatively original
to the readers of this country; believing at the same
ti.ue, that an old familiar piece, so it he excellent in j
itself is far preferable to an original article having
no claim upon the attention of persons of relincd
literary taste.
A portion of the talent of the ag , in this country
and in Great Britain, h s been exercised in the
periodical department of literature. We need not
mention the names of Campbell, Wilson, Bulwcr,

Of chorishcd hope to mc.
Yes, whoul looked to it with hope,
Earnest and full of trust,
It left me with despair to cope,
Low crush'd into the dust!
I trusted that its genial breath
Would warm that pallid check?
Nor deemed that it could yield to death,
A sufferer so meek!?
But it awoke from wint'ry graves,
Each nameless shrub and flower,
Which by tho streamlet ceaseless waves,
And decks the wood-land bower.
But to that human flower so dear,
No gentle aid was given!
It drooped and withered without care,
And from its stalk was riven!?
'Twas on the loveliest morn of Spring,
I saw hor life go out,
And with her latest suddering,
Mixed Nature's joyous shout.?
For birds were warb'ling in the bowers,
Mid flowers that sparkled gay,
Nor even wept the gentle showers,
Though she had passed away!?
?Then ask mo not, to love the Spring,
It may not?cannot be?
For it lias been the withering
Of Joy and Hope to me! ?

MOONLIGHT AT SEA.
The moon is up! As faithful watchman hath
His lantern trinnn'd oid weather beaten Night,
And o'er the circuit of his azure path
Pours out a flood of molten silver light.
Alone upon the deep with flutt'ring sail,
Tho hardy vessol holds her bounding way,
Like some sca^d spirit, borne along the gale,
And mcrg'd upon tho tide of everlasting day.
No voice is heard, nor living sound, that may
Disturb the carol of the helmsman's glee,
Savo when lie stills that iow-liumm'd roundelay,
And cries aloud, ttie well known " liard-:uleu."
Fast lock'd in sleep, tho weary messmates hold
In fairy dreams the fruits of cam ami time,
And bring tho profits of their hard-carn'd guid,
To those they love, in some fur distant cliine.
All others here of trav'lcrs on the wave,
Scarce give a thought, a moment's thought, to
know
IIow soon the tempest might scoop out a grave,
And hurl their spirits to the shades below.
But God is nigh! His mercy never sleeps,
Thro' scones of time; or in ctornity:
But o'er his nconle sovereign truidauce keeps
And opes " tho haven wlicro they all ivould bo "
So let me feel that spirit ever kind,
In holy pow'r o'er life's tempestuous sea;
To still the angry passions of the mind,
And lead my soul, my God, at last, to thee.

JANE HOWARD.
Miss Jane Howard was the daughter of
a rich merchant residing in the city of Baltimore.
Her personal appearance was
truly prepossessing; but the graces of a
superior education, and the benevolence
of her naturally warm and virtuous heart,
rendered her an object of universal esteem
and admiration, among all with whom
she was acouainted. At a vcrv eariv ase
she embraced the Christian religion, and
much of her time was spent in promoting
religious and benevolent objects.
In the fall of 1828, Jane, with her elder
brother, embarked on board a packet
for Charleston, South Carolina, for the
purpose of visiting their friends. The
Captain of the Packet was a man about
twenty-five years of age. Ilis person was
comely and his manner agreeable, with
the exception of one fault, too common
among sailors, he was profane. The modesty
of Jane's appearance attracted his
attention; he gained an introduction to her
by means of her brother, and was still
more charmed by the sweetness of her
conversation than he had been by the grar
i
ces OI HUT pursuit.
It was not long, however, before another
oath escaped his lip3, which shocked
the delicate sensibility of Jane. She politely
requested that he would desist from
such language while she remained on board
the vessel, to which he immediately consented
with deep chagrin. During the
remainder of the voyage, the captain's
attention to Jane was rather increased

time in her company, charmed and delighted
with the modesty of her deportment,
and the fascinating spell of her instructive
conversation; but not another
oath was he heard to utter until they arrived
in Charleston. They were now about
to part; but Jane, feeling no small inter-;
est in the welfare of one whose unremit-j
ted attention more than indicated his soli-'
citade for her own, ventured to ask if he
would grant her one request. The cap- j
tain, with all the enthusiasm of an infatuated
lover, replied that whatever request j
she was pleased to make, if possibly in'
his power, it certainly should be granted.
Then, said she, accept this bible, and
my request is, that you read a portion of
it every day.
Ho feit surprised, but considering that
he had given his pomisc, he felt himself
bound to fulfil it. !{

the winter with her uncle, who resided in
New Orleans. The first Sabbath after !
she arrived there, she accompanied her'
uncle and family to church, and heard a'
sermon of uncommon interest, delivered j
with eloquence and religious pathos.
The minister evidently a man of supe-;
rior talents; his voice deep toned and
agreeable. His figures were applicable, I
though high wrought and beautiful.
He possessed, in fine, the rare faculty i
of chaining an audiancc in almost breath- j
less silence from the commencement to j
the close of his discourse. But Jane,
whose tender heart was exquisitely susceptible
on the subject of religion entered
so deeply into the spirit of the sermon,
that she entirely forgot, for a time, the
distance which separated her from her
friends, and all the circumstances by
which she was surrounded, with the exception
of the rolling sentences as they i
flowed from the lips of the speaker. 1
1 ho meeting closed; and while Jane i
and her friends were waiting in their pew i
for the aisle to be cleaied, the preacher
came down from the puipit, advanced towards,
and addressed Jane as follows:
' If 1 mistake not, I am addressing i
Miss Howard/"
A confused succession of ideas flitted i
across the mind of Jane; but recollecting i
herself she politely replied:
' That is tny name, sir, but I do not re- i
collect to have had the pleasure of seeing <

" Perhaps you recollect liaving sailed
from Baltimore to Charleston about five :
years ago, in the packet Thomas Jefferson, ;
and of having given a bible to the captain? 1
"I do," she replied, "I recollect it well, l
and, :f 1 mistake not, I recognize the
captain in the person before me! can it be
possible?"
" It is possible," he replied, " it is so?I
am the man! and 1 shall evor feel the ]
deepest gratitude to you, Miss Howard, j
for the interest you manifested in my wel- ]
fare. That bible and the reading of it <
has made me what 1 am."
I will not attempt to describe the feel- .
ings produced by this unexpected meet- |

invited home with them, and during the <
winter his visits were neither few nor far

RETURN OF THE JEWS. J
The following article from the N. Y. i
Evening Star is from the pen of its editor, j
M. M. Noah, as well known for its enthu- j
siasm in every thing relating to his people
and nation. The events now transpiring j
in the East, certainly possess deep interest j
to the student of Biblical lore, and the ,
return of the Jewish nation to the land of '
their fathers, may be nearer its approach (
than is generally believed. (
After quoting an article from a late .
English periodical, in which the present J
number ot the Jews is estimated at mree |
millions, lie comments on it as follows: ^
" Wc apprehend there is some error in |
the above statistics, and the number of the t
Jews, throughout the world, may be estimated
at nearer six millions than three. 1
There are more than a million in Poland ;
and Russia; in all Asia there are full two j
millions and a half; half a million in Aus- (
tria; in Barbary States and Africa a mil- j
lion; in all Europe two millions and a half.
We do not think during the most splendid
periods of Jewish history they have ever
exceeded lour millions, but then their .
colonies and countries held tributary to
l?nrnnn on/I Acid omniinlnH tn mnnv mil- '
uutuj/b uim J
lions more. For example, at one period '
all Spain paid tribute to King Solomon;
and all Spain and Portugal,. at this day, I
are decendants of the Jews and Moors,
and there are many thousands of Jews in
both these countries, now adhering in secret
to the ancient faith of their fathers, <
while outwardly professing the catholic .
religion. All the familiar Spanish and j
Portuguese names?Lopez, Mondez, Carvalho,
Rodrigeus, Peirara, Azavcdo, Montefiores,
&c. &c.?arc of Jewish origin.
Their numbers, therefore, will never be
acurately known until the restoration, when
thousands who, from convenience or pride,
and some from apprehension, conceal their
religion, will be most eager to avow it
when their nation takes rank among the
governments of the earth.
Though they may not be powerful as to
numbers, they will still outnumber several
of the existing European monarchies, but
for the diffusion of general intelligence?
quickness of apprehension?aptness in
business concerns?amazing industry and
enterprise, and incalculable wealth, they
will constitute, for their numbers, the
greatest nation on earth, and the whole
of Judea will, in a few years after the restoration,
exhibit a most splendid spectacle
of the united powers of riches, talent,
and indominable enterprise. All the old
ports on the Mediterranean will .be again
opened, the harbors cleared, and the
ruined cities rebuilt, from Alexandria to
Bosphorus; the old canal re-opened from
Cairo to the lied Sea; the trade to India
through the Straights of Babelmandcl
revived?manufactories established, and
the water power of the Jordan and the
Dead Sea used for the mills?railroads
laid down to the Euphrates, and the whole
of the commerce of Persia divided into
new channels. What the result of the
restoration may be, is not to be doubted;
but the means of bringing about this event
are not so well established as yet. Wc

the Pacha of Egypt refuses to yield obedience
to the Sultan, and the Sultan, is
sustained by Russia against Egypt; if
Persia forms allies, and takes part in the
wars; if India is threatened, and the war

of the Jews as a measure of policy
and expediency may be closer at hand
than many imagine. Come when it may
