We copy the following from the Xat- M

Civil War in Tcxas.?For some time ^
ast, (as wo remarked in our pa; cr ? F! 0
ist week* the parties in Eastern Texas, > t<
nown as the Regulators and Moderators, '
ave boon''indulging in seditious I rods 1
lid feuds?committing retaliatorysicts of
utrage upon the lives and property of the
itizens ; rendering the peace and
itv of the community precarious in the 'j
i^erne. The viofcrtt mra-uros of each !
rtrly Ip'.ye nt lengMrflrovoked the govern- :
nont of'IV.via to active measures for;
heir suppression, and the Colonel com- j
nandant of the mdrtia of St. Augustine
;ount\y has received orders to draft two
uin.Ifed men to rfncll the tratorous facion.s<-.
There will do dofht he some,
doodshed in the event of nn encounter.
The hrfititiff m i v be jdihed thy the rd?uars,
but it is believed that thp Moderators
vtll be routed out. The object which
nirnarily brought the Regulators together,
was the honorable wish to rid the
tomnmnity of the unre inveterate of a
argo band of loafers, twdife and gam>!ers,
who were residing in their midst,
tnd sadly injuring tin interests of the
immunity, by their urrgoverned and j
aw loss conduct. Thealo^erators have
isen into distinction lijjopposing all the
lets of the Regulators, in 'th'-ir ranks,
ire this band of uesperatocs. Roth paries
are in iarge nuin|>eH and comprise aijreat
portion of the inhhitants. They
lave regularly chosen curtains and commanders;
their disciplir^ too, is based
>n an arbitrary and dlitnry co;!c.?!(
Whenever a ban lofeithfl party moot to- j
