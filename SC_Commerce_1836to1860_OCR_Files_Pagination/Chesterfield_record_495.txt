ral education has been thought of in tli
connlry ; ami even now few consider
of any importance. Agriculture is ?
itself a science, of a deep and abidir
interest, of as much intricacy, and
thorough knowledge of which is as hat
to be acqu;red and understood, as any <
the sciences. Itis of primary iniportanc
as affording food and raiment to the In
man family. It is the great hinge o
which hang the Commerce and Mam
factures.
Had our forefathers properly estimate
the importance ofagr.cultural knowiedg
we should not at this day have witnesse
such a succession of useless, uncultivatc
and worn out lands as are to be see
through most of the Southern Slates.What
patrimony can a father leave li
son equal to a correct agricultural ccluc;
tion, connected with habits of industr
and temperance formed by the father
precepts and examples !
Let us set about an improvement,
little tabor and money skilfully applie
shall restore the lost energies of our ha
reo wastes, and ?4inake the wildcrne
blossom as the rose," while Ceres slm
bless the labors of the husbandman ai
smiling plenty fill his weII-stored game
with the precious fruits ofiiis industry.

On funking over what we have writtei

In order to have the seed take well, tl
ground must be well prepared and mai

should lie sown broadcast the beginning

or cattle three or four times in a sea so
ami the quantity that an acre will produc
is truly astonishing.
We also forgot to speak against ti
pernicious practice of fall or winti
ploughing, for a crop the spring erisuir
Rolling lands will sillier more injury froi
tins practice than those thut are level
hut we object to it generally, as it leavi
the naked soil exposed to the severity <
frosts, to drying and driving winds, I
which much of the strength and Aim
parts of the soil must "waste their fn
granre in the dt strtaif
Few farmers appear properly to con
prebend the process of evaporation ; an
the groat loss that, not only soils, hut m;
nitre* *iiifor by it. We would rocon
iriend, at ail times, as little e.x|xi?iure <
the soil to hard frosts, hot sun and dry in
wind*-, as epav be consistent with a di
preparation v.f them for the diftlrci
crops they are to receive and produce,
htt e reflection arid attention on tho pa
of the prucieiii husbandman will save hi
/iiuc!', annually.
Connected with this subject is that <
applying mannres. A great diversity <
opinion prevails i?s to the proper pcrod <
applying the ham-yard manure?whetl
er in\1*r spring, on the corn ground, or i
the full 011 the wheat. We have alwa>
been in the practice of getting it out i
the Spring, on the corn ground, spreadin
jit on the surface and ploughing it und
with the sod ; and we are persuaded tin
thus is the j ro|)cr time to apply it, as
would otherwise lose .much of its esscnta
qualities by evaporation. Our cattle ru
in the commons, where they have a ti.i
range, plenty of }>asture and }H.ire wate
and we take great care to have them ya
ded every night. By these means, au
our compost pit, we have a pretty goc
supply of manure in the fall for our wliei
crop.
On the subject of iniprov ing the soil 1
turning in green crops, such as bucl
wheat, tares, cow-peas, &c. we lurve sa
nothing, not hav ing had much cxpericru
in th it way ; we are not, however, fro
?Ur limited knowledge on the subject vei
?gawng?BUI3 MW WB JJil?
friendly to it; for we think that where
is those would grow clover would grow also, 1
it and that answers our purpose well enough. (
of We would prefer letting this be so ripe c
g that the sceJ would vegetate ; for we are t
I I f
a of opinion that no verv great advantage
d is to be derived from turning in unripe 1
of crops, full of watery sap ; and before the
:e saccharine principle is formed in the
i- plant. If the clo\erseed be ripe it will
n save the expense and trouble of sowing
j- again the fullowing spring; as it is always
understood that a clover lay is intended
d for a wheat crop.
;e Marls.?We have unaccountably overd
/ooked these valuable materials for mad
nurc, and think proper to say something J f
n concerning them here. Marls are mostly 1
? found near tide watet. Tiiey abound
is from the Hudson to the gulf of Mexico, in .
i- the alluvial formation. They arc of two I
y kinds, argillaceous and siliceous, with car- '
's bonatc of liinc. In applying marl as a
manure, attention should he paid to this I
A 'circumstance; as the siliceous will be bet(I,
tor for clayey soils, and so on Hie other
r- hand, the argillaceous for sandy. The
ss lime they contain is either from decayed
ill shells, or from shells worn down by attriid
lion. They are durable manures and
rs should not be neglected when they can
be obtained at a reasonable expense.
A new species of marl has been lately 1
discovered in New Jersey, to which has
been given the name of "green sand." 1
. Its valuable property as a manure is said (
to be carbonate of potash; but bow any .
considerable quantity of this alkali should |
exist in the eartii is hard to understand. '
Wo incline to the opinio:*, from the similarity
in the chemical properties of the
re two articles, that that which has received
the name of carbonate of potash, will on
closer inspection, lie found to Ik* carbonate
of soda. It is, however, of little consequence
which it may he as it regards the
value of the material for manure. They
ire both excellent manures. We have
never seen the article, and therefore are
not prepared to passu decisive opinion as ]
to the constituent parts of it. Our rea- |
soiling is altogether analogical in this !
case, and must Ik; received as such.
When speaking on the subject of lime
we neglected to say any tiling of shell
limn. This may often he* obtained by
fanners who arc situated too remote from |
il '" n nmnnrn:
Oii,utu; iimr t?/ uob 11 ? u .......
Siicll lime lias been used by tbc writer, i
and he gives il as his opinion, that in j
strength it is nearly equal to slaked stone ! J
lime. A good way of applying it, espec-!
.ally where negroes are depended on to do I
the labour, is to run the field off with a !
Mght plough in squares of 1G1-2 feet.
This will give the number of square rods i
contained in an acre, 1G<>. On each
square spread one bus!u I or less of lime,
n- without layir g down in u heap. This is i
worth the trou pe also in spreading stone |
lime, as the farmer will then I tunc exactly 1
how much he spreads on an arre.
We have endeavored to l>e particular in
n our details; hut there will still bo much
' left to exercise the ingenuity and indusl("
try of the skilful husbandman , and if he
,r !>e only half as much attached to his ocr*
cupation as we are, he will always find
10 pleasure in this laudable and honourable
av ocation. One essential part of the dua
ty of the good husbandman is to keep a
y diary in which he iste enter, from day to
i /!ui- iiII <hr> ororpodin/rs as thev transpire
...., n. ^ , J
on the farm ; such as the time at which he '
luaiiured, ploughed and sowed, as well as
the time he reaped and the product or
n* the crop of a particular field. He should
'e occasionally try e\p< rimcnts, note the
time, manner and results ; and if they he '
,c of utility, communicate them to some agri. |
"r cultural journal. We'live for others as i
well us for ourst lv?s ; and if this sentiment
m were duly impressed on the mind of every
' farmer, a fund of information would he
accumulated?as well for the guidance of
D the present generation as for the instruction
of our children and succeeding generutions.
The lamentable ignorance of
many who are nevertheless compelled by
the sorce of circumstances, to follow the
1j occupation of a farmer, is greatly to he
deplored, and is one of the causes that
" has called forth our feeble exertions by ,
1" way of remedy.

THE CULTIVATOR
4 Consoiida. ton of Bud's Cultivator and
Genesee Farmer.
W. Gayl' Rd & L. Tucker, Editor.
PROSPECTUS OF VOLUME VIII. FOB.
1?41.
In off ring to the agricultural public of tlie
Umled States the prospectus of thd Eighth
volume of the Cultivator, (the second ol the
New Series,) we desire the privilege of taking
our put. ons and correspondents familiarly
and cor dully by llie band, and thanking them
roost beariiiy for the very liberal aid and sup-*
port th<y have rendered us, both Ly thuir
communirations and their suoscriplious.
The Cultivator was established to improve
gnd elevate the Agriculture of the country; to
aive a proper one io the morals and mind of
the farmer; to show hun the dignity and in?
portance of his profession ; to store hi* mind,
with useful knowledge, and convince him
that while all classes are and must be more
or less dependeut on each other, he alone of
the whole cau make any near approach to independence.
II there isoDe thing more than
anuther, which in th s country gives a man
superiorly over his fellow men, it is know ledge
; and this knowledge,?knowh dge which
is as essential to the success of the faimer ta
of other men, it Is the design ol the Cultivator
10 aid in imparling.
In taking charge of the Cultivator, toe Editors
were aware of the arihtous nature oi the
undertaking Under its former conductor, thie
journal had already attained a verv high char**
acter, and we m ght have shrunk irom the
task of sustaining the reputation it had gained*
or from the effoils necessary to still farther elevate
its standing, had not the assurance of
aid from the ablest writers and the most (experienced
farmers of the country,?aid w hich
our columns will show has been and wdl be
most promptly and fully rendered; encouraged
us to the undertaking. How far we have
uccced" d must be lift for the readers of the
Cultivator to determine; but if an increase of
subscription beyond any precedent in ibe historv
ol agricu tural journals of this c; ui)try ; w
if ihe almost unanimous voice of the public
pr? ss in our Lvor ; if the mul itudt of private
yet flattering testimonials we have received,
added :o a circulation probably treble hat of
anv other journal di voud to the agncuitura
unrest, may be admitted as evidence, then
we have certainly most ai.undant reason to
no giaiifird with out success.
in our efforts to render the Cultivator worthy
of the patronage it has received, no expense*
or labor has been or will be upe.,red.
As it is every where received as the exponent
I of the condition and prospects of Agriculture
;i? the Uni'ed Sta'to, we intend that eveiy
subject connected w ith the great interest or
any part of our country shall receive its due
share of nut ice, and its proper place in our columns.
Ti.e Cultivator will be a rec? rdof all
iiuprovenu Ills in the stitine ot Husbandry;
ol the iutioduction of new and important var.
net ie> of seeds and plants ; of the nspective
values ami adoption of the several improved
breeds' of flotr.es. Cattle, Sheep and Swine,
io uilliri nt sections of the United States ; in
short it is intended to m<ke it a Work which
slia 1 interest, instruct and be acctp'able to
all.
In the number, variety, and* excellence of
the illustrations, the Culi.vati r is without a rval,
4 it her a: h?>mo or abroad. Thia depart,
in* lit wilt he fully sustained, and increased ititeie.-t
and attraction given by a greater numb<
r oftigur* ?of American Annuals selected
irom our best sp< c miens of all ktuds, native
I and imported, by tiro drawing of new Implements,
Agr;<uliural and Mechanical: and by
engravi. gs of such objects as will be better
understood, when given withsuchiliustrations.
The engra tigs and illustrations of the ptfsent
volume will be nearly equal to one hundred
in number; and the satisfaction tbejr
have iriven <>ur uatruns will secure tlreircon*
C f
tinuauce notwithstanding the great expense
I hey necessarily occasion us.
The sales of the Cultivator have been so
great dunn^ the past year, and the demand
for the back volumes as well as the cum in*
one so constant, that we have stereotyped ^
eat h number ; and siiall be able, *?ow and hereafter.
to furnish subscribers with whole sets,
or any s ngle volumes they inay de-ire.
Tc our peisonaJ friends, to the friends of
Agiicultun*, to liinse Gtn-h rneii who have
acu d as our Agents, to Pus: masters generally
throughout out country,?in short tc all those
who have so generously interested iletusdves
>n our In hall, n bringing a ki.ewb dge of our
woik to the no'ice of ti?eir fr tnds, and.in obtaining
subscribers; our most heartfelt aud
cordial than b are due. While we have en~
.'cavorcd to m.the our terms such as to offer an
coiiatc induct merit and reward to those who
arc d is p.'st d from pecuniary motiv< s to interest
tlieiiist Ivi 8 m our favor, we sha.l still he
indebted to all who will in auy way aid us in
our cfloris to make the Cultitator more generally
useful, .either by increasing its circulation
or employing their pens for its columns.
Our gratitude is especially due to those grn?
tinmen whose numerous, ab e and varied communications
litsve given such an interest and
\ a ue to our paper ; and we are confident f om
licir well km u n regard to the vital interest*
of American Husbandry, thai cur appeal to
tlu in for their farther aid, w'.U not be iu vain.
Wc invite a mmunicatiobs i.otn all. There
is scarcely a subject in nature that is not more
or less intimately connected with agriculture,
I i d may not be made subservient in its ad-,
aiu tine lit.
