Correspondence of the Charleston Mercury.
Washington, Feb. 17, "1842.
SENATE.
Mr. CI17 presented a memorial from citizens
of Bedford county, Pa., attributing the distress
which so generally prevails to the operation of
" the Compromise Aet, the operation of which
? "they ask may bo arrested, and the tariff 60 revised
as to "afford encouragement to domestic
manufactures. He said he differed entirely
with the petitioners as to the cause of the present
embarrasment of the country. They attributed
it to the Compromise Act, and in his
opinion they were utterly mietaken. Up to the
o* _'A TNrtnAwiUrt* Iftef rwAVfl Y\vr\i?%f*f Hffia ft f_
OitJIUi 1/CLCiuuci jaovf Iiiviw pi^vvwvn woo aiforded
to oar domestic manufactures by the provisions
of that Act, than any man would now
propose in an original mear-ure. He thought
that complaints, against that Act came with an
ill grace from Pennsylvania, as it was passed
with a view to preserve the protective policy
from the utter annihilation with which it was
threatened by Pennsylvania's favorite. He
would say that it was passed for two reasons.?
> First, to prevent the civil war which was threatened
by the action of South Carolina, and
which would probably have extended to other
portions of the Uuion: and, Secondly, to preserve
the protective system, which atrthe ensuing
session must have failen under the overpowering
influence of the distinguished and il.
Justrious man then at the head of the Government.
The present disasters were to be attributed
to the embarrassed condition of finances,
and 10 the policy which prompted the States to
plunge into schemes of internal improvement
and to run in debt to foreign nations. While
bond9 could be sold, and debts contracted, there
was a delusive appearance of prosperity, which j
vanished as soon a9 credit failed abroad, and the I
interests as well as the principal, as it became j
due, fell upon that upon which is based the imDorte
of the country. It was hie purpose, so
long as he remained ir. the councils of the nation,
which wouid not be long, to adhere, faithfully
and honestly adhere, to the principles of the
Compromise. If incidental protection was afforded
sufficient for our manufactures, well;
hilt if the interests of Pennsylvania, or any
other State, demanded that the revenue point
should be exceeded, and that they should go for
protection, he hoped their Senators and Representatives
would take it up, and push it to the
extent they deemed desirable. They must take
the lead in the matter; artd if they made out a
sufficient case, he would follow.
Mr. Calhoun said he had no doubt the Senac,
tor from Kentucky was correct in the motives
which he had assigned to those with whom he
generally acted for their support of tire Compromise
Act; but the South was actuated by
totally different motives. She considered the
policy indicated by the Tariff Acts of 1823 and ,
1832, as a palpable violation of .the Constitution,
as destructive of her interests, and that
it would lead to the overthrow of the Government
teelf. In co isenting to the Compromise
Act, they considered it an Act which surrendered,
in tola, the protective principle, and that t ie du- '
ties-were to be reduced gradually to 20 per
cent, which thereafter was to be the maximum. I
In thr.t view alone was it assented to, and he
-considered any increase above 20 per cent, a
violation <rf the Compromise, if it could be
avoided by reclaiming the land revenue, and 1
the strictest economy in expenditures. In his ,
opinion the consequeuces would have been ve- J
different from those auDnosed bv the Sena-'
? lor from .Kentucky, had-the Compromise not,
been adopted. Gen. Jackson, with all his power,
fctfdhe admated it was as great as tha: of any
of the crowno'd heads of Europe, could no.
break dawn or reduce to any extent the Tariff of
' 1828. It was attempted in 1832, and it was I
only reduced about throe millions, when it
opght to have been reduced fifteen, and it
W38 then declared by the Sena or from Kentucky,
and the then head or' the Treasury Der artmen ,
Mr McLine, that that arrangement was final.?
. - The next Session, in the House, the attempt
at farther reduction utterly tailed: In this state
of things there was no other remedy than the
one which was applied, and scucessfully applied.
It had been most beneficial in its results.?
Our commerce had nearly doubled; our tonage
had fully doubled; and yet gentlemen, with all
these facts before them, seem detirmined to recommence
a policy which ha9 proved to be so
detrimental to the true interests of the country.
In his opinion, if any thrng saved our country^.. J
was the Compromise Act; it had preserved not ,
ouiy the minUiacturerc, but our institutions. j
.Mr. Clay replied at considerable length. He j
hoped when the tariff was. brought up :or revision,
it would be approached in a sp.nt ol" ami- I
ty. He would not now discuss the po;nt whc-j
ther if the duties slrould exceed 20 and go up to ;
25, 28 or even 80 per cent, when necessary for
rjvenue, it would be a violation of the Coiupro- ]
mise, but he would endeavor when the subject i
was taken up to show that it was not. While'
Ke.would go to the extremes: verge in ccono- i
tn.sing and entrenching expenditure he would j
show that even if the land fund was recalled,'
wh:cb would only make a d.fference of about
two per cent, it would be impossible to keep
within the 20 perce t
Mr Calhoun said if the revenues from the
lands were returned to the Treasury, and the |
expenditures were brought down to the estimates
of last year, with retrenchment in minor
matters, they could keep with n 20 per cent.
kntro onmAt^inrr rtVPf fnP Q ftinkitlOT flllld tO
liquidate our public debt.
Mr. Freston also spoke at some length as to!
the motives of South Carolina, in acquiescing
in the Compromise act, which were in effect, |
the same as aesigned by Mr. Calhoun. Pie!
concluded with expressing his determination to
vote for any amount of duty necessary for an
economical administration of the Government;
fcut for no duty over 20 per cent, until the land
revenue is reclaimed to the Treasury.
The petitions was then referred to the Committee
on Manufactures.
Mr. Mangum introduced a bill providing for
the construction of a war steamer for harbor defence.
The bill appropriates 8250,000 for a
steamer to be built principally of iron, on the
plan of R. L. Stevens, with whom the contract!
is to be made, the vessel when ready for ser- j
vice not to h ive cost more than the average of j
the Mississippi and Missouri steamers.
The biils ordered to a third reading ypstcrday j
were passed, and reveral private bills were con
ittee oi the Whojc, and or I.-.-c
. _ ed for a third reading.
M-.. presented a memorial from
Huntingdon county, of similar import to the
one presented in the morning by Mr. Clay, and
w ithout expressing any opinion of his own on
the subject, he read extracts from Gen. Jackson's
n;e- anro i- m:<*> and his message of Jan.

oi utterly destroy uthe protective system, but
"wbb in tavor of disci iminatmg duties.
A motion was then made to adjourn until Hon-1
tiay. which W38 opposed by Mr. Merrick on thej
ground that the Select Committee on the Currency
would agree on their report to-morrow, w
and it would be presented to the Senate, and by tl
Mr. Sevier because a great many private bille tl
might be pa66ed if. the day was devoted to that, k
purpose. t<

MR. WEBSTER.' (
Rumors are beginning to appear in the public t
prints, that this eentieman is about to retire from 3
the Cabinet. We have no means of ascertaining i
his movements. We sincerely wish Mr.. Tyler a
safe deliverance from his counsels. He is no
great favorite of the Democracy; and, for our own 3
parts, we are free to confess, that, from the mo- t
menthe came to this City in October, 1$40, at 8
tbe bidding of the Whigs, to play the impos'er, F
and to pass himself off upon Virginia as a Jeffer- 3
sonian Republican, we lost all respect for his 3
moral qualities, and our respect for the man.? 0
From such a baenful influence in tbe Cabinet, 1
we wish Mr. Tyler a safe deliverance. 3
Mr. Webster's situation, indeed, i6mos; unen- e
viable. Suspected by all the Democracy, he is 0
becoming an object of denunciation with 6ome of c
tbe Whig party. The severest charges are now "
unhesitatingly made against him. Prentice, of a
the Louisville Journal, (of the Clay clique, and 11
the author of his Biography,) has recently propa- v
gated a most scandalous story about Mr. Web8ter's
attempting to convert his Department into d
a Harem to gratify his sensuality: and the story
is stated of his making an attempt upon the vir- ^
tue of the wife of one of his Clerks, who visited P
his office for the purpose of obtaining some manu- "
script to copy with her pen. It is said that Mr. ?
Webster has taken steps to disprove the story; 11
and the New York American says, it has seen
j- t... h
authentic copies OI amaavus mauc uj unu, aiiu
by every Clerk in his office, to contradict it '
These have been forwarded to Prentice for pub- 1
lication. We shall wait to hear both eides of v
the story. e
The "Independent/' (Mr. Clay's organ, we c
still call it so, whatever it way eav, because it is a
in his confidence and in his in'eres's,) is opening c
a tremendous battery uoon him. In its No ot 81
last Tuesday, it begins with, No 1, Daniel Web- 0
ster, with this emphatic motto? }'
tl
Not till thy fall could mortals guess,
Ambition's less than littleness." n
It lays on the lash wiih an unsparing hand?
It speaks of him in the following unmeasured 0
terms: f,
"We have never been amonT those who re- ^
yarded this gentleman as "godlike" in any of his 0
attributes; bu\ on the contrary, have always S(
thought that these claims and concessions of ex- 8;
tra-human abilities were most injurious to him n
and debasing to others. Their effect. upon him e
has been sad indeed. He has considered him- j
self released from the common concerns of life, jt
which claim the attention of all mere murtale, H
until their neglect has been attended with an ut- e
ter sacrifice of character and Independence? C(
These, however, are points upon which we will a
not dwell. We will leave him to settle with h
his idolaters, whether they have been more to p
blame in giving credit to his claims, or he in a
abusing their generosity by over drafts. Nor C(
will we enter upon certain other points which j.
have Jateiy oeen enrargeo upon uy oumo iks r,
scrupulous of our contemporaries. If it be true, ?
as has been alleged, that the Secretary ol'S a e 8l
has literally made his public power the pander to i(
his libertinism and his lust6; that in him ia re- u
vived the worst features of the age of Domilian;
that he, coming from the land of the Puritans, is D
really one lj
quem M.issa tim"t, quom muncre p ilp it ?
Curus, et a trepidoHyiin lesubuiissa Latino"? c
If these things be true, we would indeed weep a
but out of sorrow should be silent. But we re- 11
peat?these are subjects upon which we do not
desire todweil. It is the influence of Mr. Web- 11
ster'u private chaiactsr upon i.is public conduct e
with which we have *c ueal. u
'Supremely selfish and devoted to pleaeu e, a
he has been, through life, prodigal of what was; L1
other's and lavish of !>;b own?Cidus alieni, w
profusus svi?and, consequently, has incurred (tV
numerous ooligationf, which tie i.as neither the w
ability tod ischarge, nor the raagrianmity to ac-' "
knowledge.
.. . .i / fnnA ' tl
"ACCU6:omeU J or yeiinj (U luuianvn, aiiu IU11U j
(as Mr. Calhoun once told him) of addressing j "
'.he galieries, he was by no means prepared toi"
abandon his prominent position in the Cabinet,!*1
while it could be retained at 110 greater sacrifice ,
of public honor than he had often before made ;
on occasions of less notoriety. He was poor? 0
selfish?indolent?and accustomed to a tame j c
submission to insult; so tha*, when he declared, 0
in opposition to every other member of the C abi- c
net, that "he could see no reason for abandoning v
his post,'it was a confusion of an obliquity ol "
moral vision, neither greater than he had former- ^
ly exhibited, nor more as'ounding than some 6
other developements which are yet to be made 11
But how distressing to his adherents! Those, am a
they are few, who know him thoroughly, we have
already said, were not astonished; but lor ti.c "
rest, the great mass of citizens, language canno "
depict their amazement." '
Here we have the cue to the griefs of the
Whigs. It is the determination of Mr. Webstei
to remain in the Cabine;, and not go all length;
with Mr. Henry Clay, that constitutes the mor ,1
tal offence ol Mr. Webster. But for this disloy- v
alty to the Ciry Clique,- his sensuality and h.;
profusion might have escaped the strictures o. .
the "Independent." .1
The same paper makes another charge upoi 0
him, which, il true, is intolerable in our republic, v
TKo Iruleripndent charges Mr. Tvler with Nepo- .
tistn (the rewarding of hin with office)?and i; c
makes a similar charge against Mr. Webster. r
"We might take ihis occasion to descant on
certain additional cases of Nepotism which are
within our knowledge. We might ask upon
what other principle a young cousin of Mr. Rob- ,,
ertTyler'6 lady was advanced in.in a live hundred
dollar clerkship to an Auditorship of 83000 v
per annum. And we might show what careiui t
provision the Secretary of Slate has made for his <J
cousinsand nephews?now three relatives of the h
name of Haddock are said to have recently re- h
eeived lucrative appointments for the merit ol p
beingakin to "Daniel the Godlike." Or we might a
subject to the crucible even the naval appo.nt- t
meats of the last ten month", and po.nt out 'the r:
cases of pure lavoriotism?but we pace.these in
evtr fw another occasion." |t
.vv
If there be the slightest truth in these charges,
e respectfully warn the Cabinet to beware of
rue violating the delicate rule laid down by all
ic Virginia Presidents, against rewarding their
insmen with office. There is nothing in worse
iste, in every respect, than such abuses. Such
onduct in Mr. Daniel Webster, is less excusale,
6ince the declaration charged upon him in
he Independent, as being made by him in the
lenate, that "neither for himself nor any relative
ad he solicited office."?But we must add in so
er truth, that the denunciation comes rather
irilh a bad grace from the "Independent," a paer
devoted to Mr. Clay, who once f-tooped to
aise J. Q,. Adams to the highest office in the
:ountry, and then immediately took from his
lands the highest office which h? had it in his
lower to confer?an office too, which Mr. Clay
ironounced to be in the "line of ea.'c pueceedents
md thu6 the direct passport to the Presidency
The Roxhury Community.?In the last num.
ler of the Boston Z?ial, is this account of the new
6sociation that has been formed at Roxhury,
Jess.
The plan of the community, as an economy,
3 in brief this: for all who have property to take
tock and receive a fixed interest thereon; and
hen to keep house or board in common, as they
hall severally desire, at the cost of provisions
lurchased at wholesale, or ra.sed on the farm;
,nd for all to labor in community, and be paid at
certain rate an hour, choosing hie own number
f hours, and their own kind or work. With
he results of the labor and their interest, they
re to pay their board, and also purchase wahtver
else they require atccsh at the warehouses
f the community, which are to be filied by the,
ommun.ty as such. To perfect this economy,:
i the course of time they must have all trades,
nd all modes of business carried on among j
lemselves, from the lowest mechanical trade,,
."hich contributes to the health and comfort life,
3 the finest art which adorns it with food and :
rapery for the mind.
All labor, whether bodily or intellectual, is to
e paid at the same rate o< wages, on the princile
that as the lafcor becomes merely bodily, it
i a greater sacrifice to the individual laborer to
ive his time to it: because time is desirable for
ie cultivation of the intellect, in exact proporon
to ignorance. Besides, intellectual laDor
ivolves in itself higher pleasures, and is more
s own reward, than buduy launr.
A lother reason for settng the same pectin; ry
alue on every kind of lakor, is, :o give outward
xpression to the great truth, that all lator .s sated,
when done tor a cunmon ini( rest. Saints
nd philosophers already know this, but the
