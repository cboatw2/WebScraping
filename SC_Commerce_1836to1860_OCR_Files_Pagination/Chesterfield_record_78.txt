INVENTION* OF PRINTING.
" Ilaerlem claims the invention of the
art of printing. It .s attributed to Lawrence
Kostcr, an alderman of that city, in 1-1-11);
wliose house is vet standing in the marketplace,
opj)osite tne church. Amusing himself
one day in the neighboring wood with
cutting the hark of lives into the le:ters that
formed the iniiials ol his name, he is said to
have laid them 011 paper, and failing asleep
when he awoke, observed, that from die dew
their form was i:i.pressed on the paper.
This accident induced iiitii to make further
cxpeiiment; he next cut Ins letters in wood,
and, dipping them in u glutinous liqwiJ, isupressed
them on paper, which lie luund an
improvement ; and, soon alter, substituting
leaden and pewter letters, erected a pi ess
in iiis house ; thus laying the foundation of
this noble art, wh.ca has thence gradually
risen to iu preseut excellence. The art, it
i^said, was stolen from him by h.s servant,
John Faustus, who conveyed it to Montz
uud, from the novelty of the discovery, soon
acquired the title of Doctor and Conjurer.
The original specimens are now shown at
the library in the Town Hall. Tnc first
is on a leaf of parchment, and the second
and third ou paper, printed only 0:1 one

At the top are wooden cu;s, representing

TELEGRAPHIC FRAUDS I.N* FRANCE.
The following statement, which wc copy
(rem the London Miming Chronicle of
March 17, dis loses a very extraordinary

"The trial of certain persons which is

d?nce can be placed on these government
communications. For a long time past, it
has been notorious that the intelligence
conveyed in this manner, has been often
wade public in a very garbled state, but
until now it was not known that individuals
could tamper with them. The parties
i gainst whom the action is brought, are
Messrs. Bianc, brothers, merchants at Bordeaux
; M. Guibot, the manager of the telegraph
at Tours ; and M. Renaud, the manager
at Bordeaux*. Parcels, it appears,
were sent, from Paris to M. Guibout, by
the mail, whenever any fluctuation occurred
in the French Rentes, consisting of
gloves, stockings, each pair denoting
a ehange of 25 centimes, and the colors the
rise and fail. Guibot then inserted an erroneous
signal in wha? ever official communication
he was making between t!ie two
places, but which was of course unclers'ood
at Bordeaux, wt::le it passe d unnoticed at
the different intermediate stations.
" This plan comnv^ced in August, 1634,
and continued undiscovered urA I the close
of lost year. During this time Messrs.
Blauc, admitted they had made ah'er paying
all expenses, 105,000 fa ucs (JL.V0OU,)
but from me evidence whicid was ?"iven
against them by the brokers of Bordeaux,
it is evident that the amount falls .far shov't
of the actual profits. Tiiree geademeii
deposed that they hud each paid the iirru
upwards of 150,000 francs, which wo.u'd
be ?19,000, anil it was also shown t!.\t
they seldom lost more than trifling sums.,
Guibout received 120 francs per month, i
and 25 francs l'ur every signal. Messrs.
Blanc contended in their defence that thev 1
only did what others were still doing not j
only at Bordeaux but elsewhere; among
many persons they cited the late Mr. Roths-'

I Valuable Improvisiest.?We Itave
; been pleased in the examination of a high-.
iy important improvement of the pump, in?
vented by Mr. Albert Cissbec, and manu
factured by .Mr. Oliver Cd wards, median;
ic of the north part of the city. It is a :
1 double acting suction and force pump, of:
i wonderful power; with a cvlender two in- j
ches i:i diameter and seven inch stroke. It?
is worked like a common pump, and by its
! double action, throws a continual stream.;
i It has capacity for discharging fifieen ml-!
j Ions per minute, and with a pipe attached,1
! will force water upward o i seventy Jive feet \
! 'perpendicular. Its struciure is very neat,'
j we may say beautiful. The valves are less 1
; liable to get out of order than in any other!
pump, and when disordered, its construction:
is so simple that the merest tyro in median, i
.i ics can take it to pieces.
| It can be fitted for any well, and is adtni-'

| other large buildings. With itieading hose j
| water can be conveyed into every room in ;

Ji frot:%& Sketch of the Chcrokces. j
written I>v slu oSheer of the Army serving |
in the West.
Tho Cttcroke v.js arc;'a people ot' good
', are aetivo mid ath -ic ie. and have been
a verv warlike piople: and would now, if
armed win su'ui.llo rmcs, make as good
light troops as miy 0:1 this continent.?
Some years ago t hey carried on, bv small
detachments, a marauding course of wartare
against the (lamanches and fawnees
of the West; but t.key are, at this tiinc, at
peace and amity v#itb a!! the world, and are
most pardcularly ?o wit!) tiie people of the
United S'-'tes, to whom, in point of interest,
and even kindred, they are closely allied, a
great many of tin an being crossed in blood
with the whites of North Carolina, Tennessee,
and other Suites of the Union. Happily
for the Chcrcikees. ilwy have no disposition
to go !o w; r with any nation or poopie;
their main object is to improve their
condition at horn being now in a country
which is :o he the ir own so long as the -'grass
continues to grcv, or the waters to run;
and nothing sho ol'tlic; most aggravating
causes could induce them into a war. It
is, however, to i frequently the case with
some of the peo; lie of the United State s, particuiarlv
those c f'the frotvier, to express apprehensions
of Indian war upon their borders.
Tins is much to be regretted, and
no doubt arisen from the want ct a true
knowledge of the people residing on their
frontier; for if they were acquainted with
their true condition and feeling, they would
very clearly see that their apprehensions
wore groundless, particularly so far as relates
to those immediately on their borders.
The Cherokees have not the most remote
idea of ever making war uven the whites,
and nothing b: r the most provoking and
__ J .. .1 ? r. i ""..i.:
outrageous con juci on me purr 01 rue wanes
towards them could induce it. Let the
whites at all times act towards them as they
should do, and they will have nothing to
apprehend from them; and the necessity of
a proper circu: nspectiorr on the [.-art of the
whites towards them, it is to he presumed
no one will pretend to deny.
It must be apparent to any one acquainted
with the Indians, who will allow himself
to reflect for one moment on the subject,
that the tribes bordering on the frontier
States, particularly Arkansas, arc sufficiently
intelligent to know that thoy could not
expect to gain nnv thing by conquest, in a
war with the United Slates, and might loose
that which in their present unsettled coiukt
on,would be ruinous to them: therefore, ih'-y
could have no inducement to go to war unless
it would he to revenge outrages that
might, but which, it is hoped, never will be
practiced upon them; and so far are they
from entertaining any thing like a warlike
feeling towards tAc whites, that insinuations
to that effect are mortifying to their feelings,
and produce in them a contempt for those
who entertain them. They dislike to be
suspected of entertaining warlike feelings,

to doubt t.Va'r fide without having better
reasons lor it than joy can at present assign.
Many of them feci great interest in fiie
affairs of the Gorenment of the U. States,
particularly sucli as the election of the President,
for whom they entertain much respect
and veneration, and hail him as their great
father, and actually look to him for the exercise
of a parental care over their future
destiny as a nation. They also feel a deep
interest in the appointment of the Secretary
of War; that officer being required, in the
course of his official ditties, to have a supervision
over the affairs of the Indian tribes,
connected with the Government of the United
States. Many oft.hem take newspapers,
from which they are enabled to ascertain
i r* i f* /? i
nc reelings or many oi the most conspieuous
members of Congress towards them, as
well as their views of Indian matters generally;
and to such of the members as they
consider to be friendly to the Indian interest,
they feel a most sincere gratitude, and becomeenthusias:icin
theirpraises; bu'tothose
who, from their acts on the floor of Congress,
appear to be unfriendly to the interest
and welfare of the lndiuns, they feel a bitter
indignation; and they are slow to forge,
either an injury or a benefit.
Many of the Chcrokccs wish, according
to a provision of some of the existing treaties
between them and the United States, to
send a delegate from their nation to the
Congress of the United States, in order that
their interest might be the more fully represented
on that floor. Others of them, how.
ever, object to such, a course, being dubious
or suspicious that it would be preparing the
way for the enroachmcnt upon thern of the
"white people's laws," which they say they
are neither prepared for nor willing to receive.
That objection, however, is grounded
in ignorance, and their having a delegate
in Congress would not necessarily produce"
the result they seem to anticipate in
Such a measure would no doubt be of ben
cftt to them. It would at least be a source
of much satisfaction to them to know that
the) were represented by one of their own
nation at the very fountain head of the Genal
Government. They heve the right under
treaty stipulations, to send a delegate
as above mentioned; but by the treaty, the
time at which they are to be allowed to send
such delegate is to he hereafter anpointed
by the Congress of the United States.?
They have men among them, at this time,
who are not only able ' to represent them if
sent to Washington city, hut who would
shfae, in point ability; as second or third

to the 11th inst. These papers corroborate
the intelligence of the schr. Champion.?
further state, that information has bieen received
from Matagorda oi the arrival of the
schr. Bonnv-Boar. Capt Thompson reports
that off Velasco, within sight of land,
lie was hove to by a Mexican brig mounting
10 guns. At this time, there were
two other brigs in sight. After being detained
for some time, and receiving six passengers
from the schr. Louisana, which
was captured at the same time, he was a1.
lowed to proceed on his voyage, having no
articles contraband of war on board; ami

was informed by Davis, the commander ol
the Mexican squadron, that lie had prcviousiy
captured the schr. Champion, laden
with provisions, arms, ammunition, and emigrants,
which he l>:ul sent to the westward.
Davis also informed him that the Mexican
army iccrc at or near San 1'utricio, advancing
towards Texas. It will be remembered
that, according to the latest account|
from Metauioras, the movement of the Mex
! icon troops was placed entirely out o! the
question.
From a letter published in the Telegraph,
addressed to the Secretary of War, (Mr.
Fisher,) by Deaf Smith, it appears there has
becn a' skirmish between him and a party
1 of .Mexican horsemen. The lbrco under
him consisted only of twenty men, and it
seems lie nas proceeding towards Loredo.

the famous fetch of the American Revolution*
When he discovered the enemy they
werae boLtamiie distant,and were advanci.ig
towards him in line order, lie suffered

The annexed paragraph will show the
extent of the trade can ned on by England
ane America in this seemingly worthless
article. The consumption of rugs by Franco
alone must be great, and when we add the
rest of Europe, u here paper making and
paper printing are carried on \crv largely,
\vc can form some idea of the vast quantity
of rag3 necessary to supply the demand
for their consumption.
Trade in Rags.?Though rngs arc apt
to bo despised and scofled at, they are nevertheless
a most important article of commerce,
and one without which, in this present
enlightened, book making, and newspapcria!
age, it would be exceedingly difficult,
to get along, in fact, were it not for rags,
we should neither have the wherein to write
this paragraph, nor the whereon to print it.
Tho English trade in rags is very extensive.
Their importation from the continent
on a:i average for the last eight years
lias been 33,009 bales. These are brought
chiefly from Germany, Hungary, Scicily,
and Italy. The places of cxporiure Ham-,
hnrg, Bremen, Rostock, Trieste, Leghorn,
Palermo, and Messina.
Besides the imports of rags into Great
Britain, an amount twice as large is collected
in the three kingdoms : where from 800
to 900 papermills are in operation?manufacturing
in all, one hundred and fifteen
;housand pounds weight of rags per day.'
America has, of late years, entered into
considerable competition with Great Britain,
in the importation of rags from the continent
ot' Europe. Our importation, for nearly
three years preceding 1836 averaged nearly
13,000 bales. For the first half year ot*
J 336, it was 9000 bales. Each bale is estimated
at 4 cwt.
Owing to this American competition in
the rug trade, the British paper manufacturers
have been forced to liic use of substitutes,
such as the refuse of flax and cotton
mills, and of cotton bagging to a considerable
extent; and the price of rags had increased
in England during the last six
months to the amount of 13 per cent. If
the use of-paper goes on increasing for a
few years to come, as it Iras for a few years
past, we know not v. hither the materials for
its manufacture are to come from. Peo
pie must wear out more clothes than they
have done, or be more careful in saving the
rags of such as are worn out of fustiion,
which, for many years past, have been of
great service in supplying the paper makers.?X.

The following is partj of a letter from

disturbed by the Mexicans, and that Texas
will either becombe an Independent
Republic, or be annexed to the United
States; in either of which events, their
lands will become valuable. Impressed
with this belief, land holders are not anxious
to sell; and but little is offered for sale,
considering the large quantity owned by
prvate persons, and thus it is, that as much
as ^0, 30, and 50 dollars per acre is asked
iter land. But necessity compels many to
, sell, and purchases have been effected at
Irom 1 to 3 dollars cash per acre for located
I lands. Unlocuted lands are selling at little
or nothing. If the planters are permitted
: to make a crop this year, land will rise at
least two or three hunerod per cent., and
now is certaiujy the most favorable time to
purchase. If I was the owner of lands in
. Hinds, I would no; hesitate a moment to
i exchange them acre tor acre, for the rich
alluvial lands on the Brasos, or for lands
| on the San Bernard, Colorado, or Gauda,
loupe; and wero you here, you would
I come to the same conclusion. The tim*
bered land on the Brasos commences about
ten miles from the mouth of the river j consists
of Live Oak, Peach, &c., and extends
from the river for ten or fifteen miles,
and has not been overflowed but oncejn
