o lir nn rtlniirirrl artolSWl III l"TrTTTnrm arc knowj
icr engagements. One object oniy can be UMign' d, and llu
* to defeat the annexation of Texas to the United '.SjUlcs. Sli
mows full well that the measure issiil! pending, and that tin
ejection of the treaty has but postponed it; She know
ll.it when tyongress adjourned it was pending in both Housed
cady to be taken up and acted on its next meeting and Um
t is at present actively canvassed by the people throughou
lie Union. - lie is not ignorant that tlie decision , will in al
robabilily be in its favor, unless it should be defeated bi
uine movement exterior to the United States." Such hi
tkes this of Mexico as meant to be.
' The United States cannot," he says, 'while the measure o!
nnexation is pending, -tand quietly by and permit such resultt
has been a measure of policy long cherished, ami deemed in
ispensable to their safety and welfare, and has accordiiylj
een an dbjeqt steadily pur/ued by nil parties, and tlic acquisitior
fthe territory inaie the subject of negotiation by almost ever)
idminUtration for the last twenty years." This policy proceedec
pon-the ideatiiat it was improperly surrendered to Spain in 1819
id that it was necessary to us. "The hazard of a conflict ol
ilicy upon important points, between the United States and one
f the leading European powers, t.ioce the recognilion of Texas
a* rendered the acquisition still more essential to their safety ane
elfajv, and accordingly increased in proportion the necessity 01
cquiring it." Hence the proposal for annexation mnde to Texa<
j. us. And sliall we now suffer her, after her accession to it, and
1 the eve of its consummation, thus to be invaded and our jdini
iirposes defeated!
The President, Mr. Shannon say^. considers Texas in every re>ect
as independent as Mexico, and as competent as she to dispose
: part or the whole of her territory. In proof of this, her mainnance
of herindejiendence a-jain'st Mexico and its recognition Hj
adiug civilized (lowers are referred to. (Indeed, the argument
- I in what follows may be said to place the legitimacy of tiie
exangovernme.it on more fivorable grounds than I hat of Mexico;
Inch is intimated to be a military usurpation.)
Our wry honor, he argues, demanded the present interposition:
r. if .Mexico i? otlendeu at the proposed annexation, we are the
F nders; it was we who projio-ed it to Texas. Humanity equally
./umandstha' we should not allow Mexico to commit the "atrones
which she proposes." If any thing can add to these objecmis,
-it is the fiction, regardless of the semblance of reality, t<j
hich the Government ot Mexico has resorted,as a prctexrfbr the
:cre>- of 17th Juno, H43, and the order of General Woll on the
Hit June last. Finding nothing in the conduct of the Govern
flit or people 01 1 exas to justity uieir oaroarous cuaracter ana
tlii|iablo violation of the laws of tuitions aiul humanity, it lias
sinned. in wnrduig them, that there is no surh government or
immunity as Texas; that the individuals found there are lawless
tntders and usurpers, without pulitical existence, who may be
glit fully treated as pirates and outcast* of society. In place of
ing these, the argument goes on to show tliat they rame there
: the invationof .Mexico herself,and upon-her assurances. The
-lory of their settlement there is briefly sketched, and the matter
en summed up in tiie following words; "The Government of
i-iieo may delude itself by its fictions, but it cannot delude the
.- t of the world. It will be held responsible, not by what it may
e*i< to regard as facts, hut b>- what are in reality such, and
town and acknowledged so to be. by all, -ave itself.
In view of all this, and of the "bloody and barbarous plan of
va-ioii proclaimed,'' Mr. Shannon says he is instructed to prosi
against it all, "a? highly injurious and olF-nsive to the United
lat-s." Still, nothing of u hostile spirit was meant by the prois
'tl treaty with Texas;and. when annexation shall be cousuinaletl.
this Government will be disposed to settle in the mostli ral
manner any i|ii"siion of boundary or the like.
The reply of Senor llejon is of about equal length with the pa r
just analyzed. It sets out thus: "'As the object of this note,
\ealing tlie falsehood with which Mexico has so long and so
nelly been dealt with, is to force us to suspend our intended
>.-tilities against the Texan settlers and revolters until the work
annexation sluill hi-completed, tlie undersigned will be under
e necessity ofexatniuing its positions."
lie then proceeds to give tlie .Mexican version of the history of
e settlement and rights of Texas, and of the conduct of tlie I 'nid
States and its citizens in the struggle between Mexico and
rxir*. i in >1 i;ii i> in* t-iiiiiu-i.13 it 11 tm urciiiitii umi iiu?

fates have been Cir twenty years what I hex' proceedings were
to accomplish?jthe aiiiiexuiion ofTexa*. The ingenious confiin/r.ixion
jmliitliiM?which may also mean "roinan "
or "(gallant confession") makes it, he thinks, apparent thai

so, what reality can there la;, hee?ks in any of the reasons of

and proceed to annex it.' Li such a plan it may prove
hat the United .Stales deludes itself with iu own fictions, but
ill be able todeceive nobody else."
lie afterwards refers to the decisive authorities and pledges
ainst the present course which are afforded by the declarations

I ministrations.

Charleston, D.ec. 14.
Cotton.?It will he recollected that our review
of the 7th inst. left the market in a languid and de<
pressed state, purchasers having towards the.close of
. the week obtained a slight advantage in some classideations
of Upland; but in consequence of the advance
in the rate of freight established by nctual en
gagements on Friday, they were demanding still lower
rates, and oit Saturday, Monday and Tuesday,
holders were compelled to come to terms in order to
make sales, and the operations, particularly of Tuesday,
establish a reduction on the middling and lower
sorts of l-4c. per lb., while the higer grades, from
their comparative scarcity, went off at the quotations
current the previous week. On Wednesday ther^^^r
was a fair demand for the article, and
were sold at the prices of the previous d0
Thursday the Caledonia's advices eara^to hand
which European buyers maintain arf^unfavorablc^

were sold at the figures of Tuesdary-,- yesterday, however,
the market was very quiet, afu effort was made .
to firing down prices, fiut without success, and buyers
retired after having taken 5(K) fiales. The fol.
lowing q uotations will give a fair criterion of tho
state of the market at the close of business, viz: inferior
and ordinary 4 a 4 3-4; middling and middling
fair 0 a 5 3-8; fair and good fair 5 1-2 a 6; choice 6
1-4 cents.
