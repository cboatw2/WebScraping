WITHDRAW THINE ICY HAND, OH DEATH.

BY MR*. F. H. SMITB.
I am not willing yet to die—
The earth ia green, the *ky i» Air,
The water* murmur gently by,

Of aummer row*, fan* my brow:
Withdraw thine icy hand, oh Death 1
Some other time,—not now—not now.
I am not willing yet to die—
Autumn ha* spread such glory round,
Painted our valley gorgeously,
And every hill with splendor crowned;
Thrown o’er each cliff a crimson wreath
Reflected in the lake below:
Withdraw thine icy hand, oh Death I
Some other time—not now—not now.
‘I am hot willing yet to die—
Our fire-side is a joyous one;
And while the wintry storm sweep* by;
More tender is each loving tone.
I cannot leave this glowing hearth,
To lay me down mid frost and snow:
Withdraw thine icy hand, oh Death 1
Some other time—not now—not now.
I am not willing yet to die—
Oh! look upon the laughing Spring,
While her fair sponsor, Hope, stands by,
And pledges life to every thing;
All nature weaves a flagrant wreath
.1 Of early flowers, to twine her brow:
Withdrawn thine icy hand, oh Death I
Some other time—not now—not now.
I am not willing yet to die—
Alas! my time would never come;
Each changing season adds a tie,
To bind me to my earthly home.
Thou, who did’st die on Calvary,
Oh! make me willing by thy power;
Trusting, but weak, I rest on thee—
Thine be the way—Thine be the hour.

Died, in Marengo county, Alabama, on the 2d
July, 1844, Mr. C. C. B. DuBose, aged 38. The
deceased was a native of South Carolina, but, for
several years past, resided in Ala. He had been a
member of the M. E. Church about 17 years. At
a camp meeting in his native state, he became a
member of the Church, probably in 1827. It is
said of him, that ho lived consistently as a Chris
tian. For 6ome time he was an active, efficient
steward and leader on this (Dayton) circuit, and,
consequently, is much missed and lamented.
The writer of this obituary had the pleasure of
seeing him only once, which was in March last,
about which time his disease, (dropsy) which had
long troubled him, assumed a most alarming ap
pearance. From that time it continued to increase
until his death.
It is due the memory of this excellent man to
say, that he was every way a consistent man. As
a citizen he was honorable : as a husband and pa
rent, affectionate : and as a master, kind. But the
best of all is, he died the “ death of the righteous.”
A little while previous to his death ho called his
eldest daughter to him and gave her appropriate
advice. He then called his wife, to whom he gave all
necessary instruction in reference to religious and
pecuniary matters. It seems, that at that moment
he felt that his earthly course was well nigh its
close. Having given the advice just alluded to,
with religious calmness, he repeated the following
words:
“ Far from my thoughts, vain world, begone,
Let my religious hours alone.
Fain would mine eyes my Saviour see,
And wait a visit, Lord, from thee.
My heart grows warm with holy fire,
And kindles with a pure desire;
Come, my dear Saviour, from above.
And fill my soul with heavenly love.”
Soon afterward he fell asleep in death, leaving a
wife and four children to lament his loss, beside
many relations and friends.

Died, at his residence, in Harris co., Ga., on the
19th August, Reuben R. Mobley, in the 50th
year of his age. He embraced religion about the
year 1823, and soon after joined the M. E. Church
He was appointed class-leader in a short time,
which important office he filled with usefulness
and acceptability, to the day of his death. Much
might be said of this good man. In all the rela
tions of life,—as a husband, father, neighbour and
friend,—he was a worthy example. We feel sure
that his virtues will long live in the memory of all
who were acquainted with him. When his friends
began to discover that he would probably die soon,
ono asked him of his hope of heaven. He replied,
that his calling and election were sure, and that
his peace was made with God. When, for a time,
be had apparently known but little of what was
passing around him, having discovered, just at the
dawn of day, that ho had recovered from mental
derangement, I asked him his prospect of Heaven.
He replied, that he felt much like getting to Heav
en. He soon sank into a stupor, and seemed to
know but little, till the next day, when his spirit
took its flight to God, who gave it Having seen
the righteous and the wicked die, I have been led
to say, “let me die the death of the righteous,and
let my last end be like his.’’

Died, in La Grange, Troup county, Ga., on the
17th August, after an illness of seven days, Mar
tha Rebecca, daughter of Frances and Edmund
Harris, aged fourteen years, five months, and
three days. Whoever reads this short obituary,
will be reminded that, neither youth nor a vigorous
constitution can ward oft' the shafts of death. Let
us all, who have children, be more faithful in talk
ing to them about a preparation for death. The
kind and affectionate step-mother of Rebecca, who
scarcely ever left her bed during her affliction,
regrets that she did not talk more closely to her
beloved daughter, on the momentous concerns of
eternity. The evening before she died, she spoke
of one of her schoolmates, whom she considered
very pious, and whose disposition wag-such as to
cause her to be respected by all the school. In
this conversation she evidently manifested some
concern for her soul. She did not, however, ap
pear sensible of her danger; neither were her phy
sician or parents, till a short time before Bhe died ;
and then her sufferings were too great to allow her
to talk with any one.
It was an affecting scene to see her Sabbath
school class-mates, with whom she always delight
ed to meet, the day after her interment, attempt to
sing some verses expressive of their great bereave,
ment; but their hearts were too full. They could
not sing. Since then, nearly all her class-mates
have made a profession of religion, and joined the
church. J. Park.

Died, at his residence, in Clarke co., Alabama,
on the 4th September, 1844, Mr. Joshua Wilson,
in the 85th year of his age. Father Wilson was
born in North Carolina, A. D. 1760, and removed
to Alabama in 1817. He had been a member of the
M. E. Church more than fifty years. His conver
sion to God was dear : and his whole life testified
to the genuineness of the work of grace on his heart.
Wherever he was seen, it was manifest that he was
an humble follower of the Lord Jesus Christ. At
home or at church ; in the class-meeting or beside
the bed of death, he was always known as the dis
ciple of Christ. And as he had been faithful to
God in life, he was not forsaken in death. He died
in peace and triumph.

Tribute of Respect to William B. Harris,
Newnan Ct., Ga.
At a meeting of the third quarterly conference
for the Newnan Circuit, Ga. Conference, which
was held at Emory camp ground, on Saturday,
August 24th, 1844, after an affecting address
made by Rev. J. W. Yarbrough, the Quarterly
Conference passed the following resolutions:
Whereas it has pleased an all-wise Creator to
take from among us a beloved friend and minister
in the vigor of manhood, and as we deem it a priv
ilege and duty for us to express our sympathies
and feelings, and to mingle our regrets over the
departed dead ; be it, therefore,
Resolved,—That in the removal of our deceased
brother, William B. Harris, the church has lost an
useful minister, and is called upon to mourn the
loss of a brother who was beloved by all, and one,
of whom it may well be said “ to know him was to
love him.”
Resolved,—That while we mourn the loss of one
whom we so much loved, we do not mourn as
those without hope, for, though he cannot return
to us, we can go to him.
Resolved,—That we deeply sympathise with the
bereaved family of our deceased brother, and ten
der them the sincere condolence of this conference
in their sad affliction.
Resolved,—That these proceedings be published
in the Southern Christian Advocate, and a copy
be sent to the family of the deceased.

HISCEIjLA jt y
EXPLORING A PYRAMID.
When we imparted to the guides our intention
to enter the largest of the pyramids, they en
deavored, from some reason or another, to per
suade us that its adit had not yet been discovered.
On this point, however, our information was bet
I ter than theirs. Bidding them, therefore, follow
I us, we rode at once to the north face of the struc
ture, where at the bottom of a sloping trench, the
opening into the pyramid appeared. But it
seemed not recently to have been entered, for the
sand blown in by the wind had so blocked it up,
that a fox or jackal would have found some dif
ficulty in forcing his way through. The Arabs
commencing operations by partly removing this
obstacle with their hands, and then throwing
themselves on their faces, slided in, though
wrong end foremost, like so many serpents.
We followed their example, and presently found
ourselves in a long gallery or corridor hewn in
the solid rock, and apparently penetrating into
the heart of the pyramid. As we were just then
returning from the uncivilized environs of Lake
Mceris, where all the gold ol Christendom could
not have conjured up a pound of wax candles,
and the heat of the climate would in a day or
two have reduced any others to oil, we had
brought along with us no other light but a small
travelling lamp, which, in the central gloom of
these huge structures would have shown but
like a glow-worm. The feeble rays, however,
of this miserable substitute for sunshine we must
on the present occasion have trusted, had not our
thrifty Arabs brought with them a few dry palm
branches, which commonly serve them for torch
es. These, by the aid of flint and steel, were
speedily kindled, whereupon we began to form
some notion of the strange building into which
we had forced our way.
For a short distance, the passages continued
very low ; but presently, proceeding right on
ward, we found space for raising ourselves near
ly upright. Our guides, preceding us with
lamp and torch in hand presented a strange ap
pearance as the red glare streamed beside them,
lighting up the rough sides of the rock, and flash
ing forward into the seemingly interminable
gallery. We advanced for a considerable time
without observing any particular change in the
aspect of the corridor, except that it continually
became loftier, but at length reached a point
where it branched ofTinto numerous narrow arch
ways, some ascending, others slopingdownwards,
while a third class stretched forward on the same
level. We struck into one of those which led
below towards the root of the pyramid, and
presently arrived at a sort of window in the rock,
into which the only guide who preceded us en
tered with his torch,and suddenly disappeared.
At first, as I coulddiscern no light,anddistinguish
no sound, I imagined that he had dropped into
some bottomless abyss, and projecting my head
into the opening, listened anxiously in the hope
of discovering what had become of him. l,more
over, shouted twice or thrice, but receiving no
answer began to be seriously alarmed. At
length, however, I perceived the glimmer of his
torch approaching, and soon as the stength of the
light sufficed to show me my way, I descended
after him through the fissure of the rock, our
companions following us. The exact geography
kof those regions it is impossible to describe, nor is
it easy to conjecture the uses lor which they were
designed. A labyrinth of galleries of all dimen
sions, traversing each other, mounting, winding,
descending, breaking away at right angles, or
stretching forward in one monotonous sweep
half filled with dust, blocked up in some direc
tions by huge fragments of rock, concealing
perhaps, some of those strange chambers of im
agery in which the sepulchral fancy of the an
cient Egyptians delighted, such are the objects
that present themselves to the eye in the rocky
basisof the great pyramid of Sakkarah. The tra
veller in Persia who has visited the ruias of
Islakkar, will probably have groped his way
through similar vaults and tunnels extending
beneath the vast foundations of that city. There,
too, the object of the excavators is scarcely to be
divined, since no use intelligible to modern
times could possibly have been made of those
subterraneous ways.
After threading for sometime the maze above
described, we entered suddenly a prodigious hall,
whose height and dimensions the united light of
our lamp and torches was insufficient to discover
to us. As we advanced along the chisseled floor,
its extremities all around appeared to be draped
with darkness, while its height extended far up
into the bowels of the pyramid. By degrees, as
our eyes grew accustomed tothe place, we im
agined we could discover, at a great elevation,
large openings, the termination probably of gal
leries communicating with other chambers, or
intended to letdown Tight upon the hierophants
during the celebration of the mysteries. Here
we fired off a pistol but the report was not nearly
so loud as in the great pyramid, where it res
embled thunder. On examining the floor care
fully, we perceived the commencement of a flight
of steps, which probably led down to other suites
of apartments far beneath that in which wre then
stood, and never in modern times explored.
But our progress was stopped by immense blocks
of stone.
UDserving inai me on in our lamp was run
ning low, and our palm branches nearly burnt
out, we hastily retraced our steps, lest, if they be
came extinguished, weshouldbe left there in utter
darkness, without the remotest chance of finding
our way out. Several of the galleries into
which, by mistake, we entered on our way back,
were closed up purposely by huge fragments of
rock. At length, however, we entered a long
gallery, which, after many windings, led us to
the mouth of a vast dark chasm, whose dimen
sions were hidden by the projecting shadows of
the rocks. Here my travels were on the point of
coming suddenly to an end. Mistaking thethick
carpet of darkness, which spread out far and
wide before me for some solid substance, I had
raised my foot, and was about to step forward,
when my progress was arrested by the sudden
shriek of one of my companions Another in
stant, and I should have been precipitated head
long into an abyss, the depth of which we could
not exactly ascertain, but conjectured to be very
great, from the length of time which the stones
we cast in, took to reach the rocks below. Prob
ably we were now looking down into the great
hall which we had been exploring about an hour
before
As there was no time to lose, we requested
our guides to make use of their best experience
and the shortest rout, by which to retreat towards
the place of -exit; whereat, after considerable
labour, we arrived. On issuing forth into the
open air, we hastily donned the garments which
we had thrown off to descend into the warm
chambersofthe pyramid, and found that they had
been sprinkled during our absence, by a slight
shower. The old Sheikh, who had remained in
charge of the camels, and the Arab girls, con
gratulated us on our re-approachment, imagin
ing, perhaps, that we had been descending to
wards the confines of the realms of Eblis.
These heroines, though in other respects suffi
ciently adventurous, had declined entering the
pyramid, the mouth of which they seemed to re
gard with horror ; but sitting down on the sand
beside the old Mehazi warrior, promised there to
await our return. They were to a certain ex
tent, indeed, interested in our safety, as they had
made up their minds to accompany us, whether
we would or not, to the Bird Mummy Pits, ex
cavated at no great distance in the rocks of the
deserts.
PEACE.
ANOTHER TESTIMONY FROM MISSIONARIES.
From the Rev. R. W. Hume, missionary of
the American Board at Bombay, a letter, en
dorsing a draft for ten dollars, to circulate peace
publications among our missionaries, was recent
ly received at the office of the American Peace
Society. I will quote its leading paragraphs.
“Bombay, Feb. 28, 1844.
Dear Sir,—I have long looked upon war as
wholly opposed to the spirit and precepts of the
gospel. The fact that war is sanctioned by the
example of professedly Christian nations,and ad
vocated by the great body of authorized teachers
of Chi istianitv, presentsa serious obstacle to the
progress of the kingdom of righteousness and
peace. The professed church of Christ, has, as
yet, very imperfectly learned, that the gospel is to
triumph rather by suffering, than by resis
tance, that we are to overcome evil with good,
and that the love which ‘ worketh no ill to his
neighbor is the fulfiling of the law.’
The time will doubtless come when “they
shall beat their swords into plough-shares, and
their spears into pruninghooks, nation shall not
lift up sword against nation, neither shall they
war any more.’ That this time may be hasten
ed on, it becomes all the true disciples of Christ
to labor and pray; and those who believe, that it
is now the duty of Christians to act on these prin
ciples, should endeavor, in the spirit of faithful
ness and love, to spread their sentiments far and
wide. (1 ) Let them call the attention of the
whole world to the evils of war. Let them hold
up before their fellow' men everywhere, the ex
ample of him who was oppressed and afflicted,
yet opened not his mouth, but wasted as a lamb
to the slaughter, and who, through death, de
stroyed him that had the power of death. Let
them have themselves a large measure of that
charity which ‘ suffereth long and is kind,
which endureth all things, which is not easily
provoked, and which doth not behave itself un
seemly.’
We may, nay, we ought to wonder, that any
of the followers of tire Prince of Peace should
be found armed with carnal weapons, going
forth under the authority of the governments of
this world to the work of death. The sight of
these things may well fill us with sorrow. But
let us see that our rebukes and our entreaties are
prompted by the spirit of tender affection, of
fervent love. We who have inscribed peace on
our banners, ought, above all others, to be peace
ful. We emphatically should be ‘ gentle unto
all men, in meekness instructing those who op
pose themselves.’
You will not take it amiss, that one who is j
laboring for the extension of the Redeemer’s
kingdom in the dark places of the earth, should
use such language to his brethren at home. I
have sometimes been pained by seeing what has
appeared to me an improper spirit manifested by
persons who advocate the cause of peace. I
snouia be sorry indeed to be classed with some of
its advocates ; but so far as I know, the Ameri
can Peace Society is not responsible for the senti
ments or the spirit of the persons to whom I re
fer. (2.)
This country, os you know, has been con
quered at an expense of blood and treasure; and
the government still retains possession through
the power of the sword. The effect is, and must
be, most unhappy on the native mind. This
doubtless presents one serious obstacle to the pre
gress of Christianity, which in their view lends
its sanction to violence and war. The missionary
of the gospel is regarded as the representative
and teacher of a religion which seeks not to re
strain its professors from the work of conquest,
and the lust of gain. (3.)
There have been instances of persons in this
country who have left the army from conscientious
motives. They have felt that it is inconsistent for
a soldier of the Prince of Peace to be fighting
under the banner of a selfish, worldly govern
ment, which seeks only its own exaltation, and
that too by violence and bloodshed. Little, how
ever, has been done to call attention to the ques
tion of the lawfulness of war; and there are still
those whom we must regard as sincere Chris
tians, who are found in the army just as good
men were once connected with the horrible slave
trade.
The publications of our society might be very
useful here. Can you not send to the different
American missions throughout the world, a copy
of all your publication? (4.) It is important that
they should entertain and impart to those among
whom they labor, right views on this sub
ject. * * *
Yours very respectfully,
R. W. Hum*.”
(1.) The only way, means are just as indispensable
in thiB as in any thing else.
(2.) Peace should never be confounded with what is
technically called non-resistance.
(3.) The obstacles to the world’s conversion from
the warring character of Christendom, deserves special
consideration.
(4.) Will not some person or persons give us a few
hundred dollars expressly for this purpose T

AN ITALIAN GIRL AND ITALIAN WA
GES.
The next day we went into the mountains to
visit the Saravezza quarry, and also the Mercury
mines. The last are very unprofitable and dread
fully destructive to human life. Mr. Powers
uses the Saravezza marble exclusively. Wan
dering amid the hovels and along a mountain
stream that discloses at every step some new
beauty in the stupendous scenery which enclosed
me, I entirely lost track of my companions. Dis
covering at last that they had gone to the top of
the mountain to visit the highest quarries, I was
foolish enough to follow.- But after winding up
for a long time, I became confused in the multi
tude of paths which continually crossed and in
tersected mine. But while I stood midway on
the mountain, doubtful what course to take, a
young woman about eighteen years of age over
took me. She wasdecidedly pretty, with a slight
and graceful form. The everlasting distaff was
in her hand, and she spun away as she slowly
J ascended the zigzag path. I inquired the path to
! the quarries; she told me she was on her way
j there and would accompany me.
We fell into a chit-chat,—sustained as well as
could be expected with my bad Italian on one
side, and her miserable patois on the other. I
asked if she was enrrying the dinner to her
friends in the quarries. “ Oh no.” she replied.
“ Ah,” said I, in true Yankee inquisitiveness, “ I
suppose you ore going up to visit your husband ?"
She burst into a clear laugh, and replied, “ Oh no,
I am not married.”
“ Well, then,” said I in perfect despair, “what
are you climbing this tremendous hill for?”
“ Oh, I carry quadrette,” she answered. “ Qua
drette?” said I, “ what is that?” On inquiry, I
I found that she was employed all day in bringing
blocks of marble, dressed for pavements, from the
quarry to the plain. A thick napkin was folded
on the lop of her head, on which she placed the
quadrette or square piece of marble, and descend
I ed with it to the manufactory below,—it was a
mile from the top of the mountain,—and then
i returned with her distaff. A mile up and a mile
back, makes each trip two miles long. She made
seven trips a day, and received for each only a
cent and a half! Thus she travelled fourteen
miles a day, receiving for it ten cents. I looked
at her, astonished and amazed. Her features
and form were so delicate, and her voice and man
ner and all were so gentle and sweet, that 1 could
not conceive for a moment that such a life of
drudgery was her lot. Yet she seemed cheerful
and happy.—Headly's Sketches.
LITERARY BEARING OF MISSIONS.
A recent London magazine presents the fol
lowing striking thoughts on the literary bearings
of the missionary enterprise:—
The subject of missions is not simply a ques
tion of morals. The genius of discovery views
with delight the advance of this mighty enterprise,
and exuks in the formation of bodies which bid
fair to lay open every portion of the habitable
flobe. The genins of science has, too, at length
iscovered that she has much to hope with res
pect to an enterprise from which at first she ex
pected nothing. Those men whom she was
wont to treat with scorn are already surpassing
the most adventurous of her sons, and pouring at
her feet stores of the choicest facts from every
part of the world. The genius of literature also
gazes with rapture on the happy omen. She
clearly sees that in the missionary brotherhood
she has found the men who are to extend her
empire to the ends of the earth, and give her
throne a stability that will be as lasting as the
sun. She beholds them subduing language
after language, reducing them to the laws of
grammar, and fixing them in the columns of the
lexicon. She sees, with grateful wonder, the
schoolhouse rising in the desert, and hears in the
depths of its solitude, the creative crash of the
printing press, as it pours forth its excellent boun
ties. The genius of commerce next advances
with selfish look and courtly step, to do homage
to the hernlds of salvation. She discovers in
them the successful pioneers of the merchant.
The genius of legislation closes the approving
procession. She has at length reached the con
clusion that in every clime the Protestant mis
sionary is the unchangeable friend of freedom
and justice, of law and order; that it is his pro
vince, and alone in his power, to prepare the
savage for the enjoyment of the most perfect lib
erty, and teach him how to use, without abusing
it Yes, the nations themselves, who dwell in
darkness, and who are groaning under the bur
den of their affliction, are at length convinced
that the missionary is at once their only light and
their only friend. Him, of all white men, they
can, and do trust, and only him. Oh 1 how
great are those persons who humble themselves
that they may exalt their speciesl How hon
ourable the missionary institution, which, at in
calculable expense, and by incredible labour,
seeks only the good of all countries, and asks
nothing in return 1 Is not this to resemble
Deity? Is not this transcendency grand?
BURIAL AT SEA.
One man died and was buried on the passage.
I never before witnessed a burial at sea, but it is
of all sights one of the most solemn, and indeed
awful and repulsive, to see a corpse, with a heavy
stone tied to it, plunged into the deep. The
shrouded body was laid upon a board, and at a
particular point in the burial service, was launch
ed over the ship’s side and out of sight in a mo
ment. For a little season there was a hush of
solemnity throughout the ship after this event,
but it made little impression, and even as the
waves closed over the body of the dead without
a trace of its passage, so did^the tide of careless
thought, for an instant interrupted, return without |
a trace ofthis image and lesson of mortality.
1 here was indeed an evening Teligious service
after this event, in the steerage, of which the
dead man had been an inmate, and this was well
attended; but I never dreamed that such a sol
emn thing as death and burial at sea, could make
so little impression on the passengers. What is
there more amazing than men’s firm reliance on
continued life, amidst the certainties of death, and
even in the presence of death before them? Men
see their fellow-men die, with as much uncon
cern as if they themselves were of another race of
beings, and death never to be their own experi
ence.—Dr. Cheever.
THE DOMESTIC ANGELS.
Women have been called angels, in love tales
and sonnets, till we have learned almost to think
of angels as little better than women. Yet a
man who knows a woman thorougly, and loves
her truly—and there are women who have been
so known and loved—will find, after a few years,
that his relish for the grosser pleasures is lessen
ed, and that he is grown into the fondness of the
intellectual and refined without an effort, and al
most unawares. He has been led on to virtue
through his pleasures; and the delights of the
eye, and the gentle play of that passion which is
the most inward in our nature, and which keeps
much of its character amid the concerns of life,
have held him in a kind of spiritualized exis
tence ; he shares his very being with one who, a
creature of this world, and with something of the
world’s frailties, is
-“ yet a spirit still, and bright
With something of an angel light.”
With nil the sincerity of a companionship of
feeling, cares, sorrows, and enjoyments, her pre
sence is as the presence of a purer being, and
there is that in her nature, which seems to bring
hint nearer to a betterworld. She is, as it were,
linked to angels ; and in his exalted moments, he
feels himself held bythe same tie.—Richard H.
Dana.
THE AFRICAN GUANO ISLAND.
The island from whence the guano is taken is
about three miles from the shore, on the south
west coast of Africa. It is a barren rock, about
a mile in circumference; has no soil, or the
least sign of vegetation. The guano lies to the
depth of about twenty feet, and without any
variationin quality. The continent is very san
dy, and also in high winds, (hurricanes, for in
stance,) will cover a ship’s deck nearly one hun
dred miles from land. The birds on the island
are a kind of penguin, and cannot fly to any dis
tance, if at all, their wings being a kind of fin.
It is believed that the captain of the vessel who
brought the guano, was the first man who set
foot on the island, which is very difficult to ap
proach, there being r.o harbour and heavy surf
On walking on it he could scarcely set his foot
without treading on the birds, and they took no
notice whatever of him, except pecking at his
feet, he beingbarefoot; and on a gun being fired,
they merely fluttered a good deal, and made
much noise. There is no fresh water it is belie
ved for some hundreds of miles along the coast,
and no rain.—Edinburgh New Philosophical
Journal.

SUBDUING THE TURBULENT TEMPER
OF CHILDREN.
Fenelon, a French Archbishop, took in
hand a difficult case, and pursued the following
course, it is said, with success. The Duke of
Burgundy, grandson of Louis XIV., and heir to
the crown, a spoiled child, of an outrageous
temper, about fourteen years old, who hod got
the better of all his tutors, was committed to the
Archbishop, with full powersto dons he pleased,
and he tells us how he proceeded; “When the
young prince,” says he, “ gave way to those fits
of passion and impatience to which a temper
naturally hot, made him hut too subject,the tutor;
the masters; all the attendants and servants of
the house were instructed to keep the most pro
found silence in his presence. They were not
permitted even to answer his questions. If they
served him, they turned away their eyes, as if
afraid to approach a creature whose passion had
overpowered his reason. Any attention they paid
him was no more than what was necessary to
preserve his existence, and that as if in compas
sion to a person deranged. His lessons were
suspended,—his books were put aside as if no
use to one so wild, and he was left to himself,—to
his reflections,—to his sorrow,—to his remorse."
These are the feelings which a parent ought to
pul in action whenever he has to deal with pas
sion of any kind: and the earlier the better.
THE ALARM WATCH.
A Lady who found it difficult to awake so
early as she wished in the morning, purchased
an alarm watch. The watches are so contrived
as to strike with a very loud whirling noise, at
any hour the ow ner pleases to set them.
The lady placed her watch at the head of the
bed, and, at the appointed time, she found herself
effectually roused by the long, rattling sound._
She immediately obeyed the summons, and felt
belter all the day for her early rising. This con
tinued for several weeks. The alarm watch
faithfully performed its office, and was distinctly
heard,so long as it was promptly obeyed. But
after a time the lady grew tired of early of rising
and when she was awakened by the noisy moni
tor, she merely turned herself, and slept again.
In a few days the watch ceased to arouse her
from her slumber. It spoke just as loudly as
ever, but she did not hear it, because she had ac
quired the habit of disobeying it. Finding that
she might just as well be withoutan alarm watch,
she formed the wise resolution, that if she ever
heard the sound again, she nevermore would
allow herself to disobey the friedly warning.
Just so it is with conscience. If we disobey
its dictates, even in the most trifling particulars,
or allow ourselves to do what we have some
fears may not be quite right, we shall grow more
and more sleepy until the voice of conscience has
no longer any power to awaken us.
“THE BIBLE SAYS SO.”
We cannot begin too soon to communicate
principles to the young, which shall govern
their minds for life. Lasting impressions are
made on them at a much earlier age than many
persons suppose. It is remarkable, that the
most important and sublime truths are, it the same
time, the simplest. For instance, a very young
child may be taught that there is a God; that we
are made to do his will; that we are all sinners;
that there is to be a judgment;Jthat Christ died
for sinners; and that those whojlove God shall
be for ever happy in Heaven.
Children should early be taught that the Bible
is the great authority; and that when it speaks on
any point, the question is settled for ever. They
should be taught to go directly to the Scriptures,
to find what is good and what is bad, what is true
and what is false. Thus, with the blessing of
God, they will acquire the habit of constantly
giving up their own notions and inclinations,
when they find a plain declaration of scripture.
I therefore think it a good sign, to hear a child
often use the expression, the Bible tayt to.
CHILDREN.
(From Black wood's Magazine )
LITTLE LEONAKD’S LAST GOOD NIGHT.
“ Good night! good night! I go to sleep,” •
Murmur’d the little child;—
And O ! the ray of heaven that broke
On the sweet lips that faintly spoke
That soft “ Good night,” and smiled.
That angel smile! that loving look
From the dim closing eyes!
The peace of that pure brow! But there_
Aye—on that brow, so young! so fair!
An awful shadow lies.
The gloom of evening—of the boughs
That o’er yon window wave_
Nay, nay—within these silent walls
A deeper, darker, shadow falls
The twilight of the grave—
The twilight of the grave—for still
Fast comes the fluttering breath—
One fading smile—one look of love—
A murmur—as from brooding dove_
“ Good night.”—And this is death!
O! who hath called thee “ terrible!’’
Mild angel! most benign'!
Could mother’s fondest lullaby
Have laid to rest more blissfully,
That sleeping babe, than thine!
Yet this is death .'—the doom for all
Of Adam’s race, decreed;
“ But this poor lamb !” this little one!
What had the guiltless creature done'!"
Unhappy heart! take heed.
Though He is merciful as just,
Who hears that fond appeal—
He will not break the bruised reed j
He will not search the wounds that bleed :
He only wounds to heal.
“ Let little children come to me,”
He cried, and to his breast
Folded them tenderly; to-day
He calls thine unshorn lamb away,
To that securest rest!
* These were the dying words of a little child related
to the author, uttered at the moment of its departure.
THE ROBIN.
In the latter end of the vear 1840 a robin flew
into the cottage of Mrs. Wilkinson, in the neigh
borhood of Overton near Lancaster: being win
ter season it was kindly treated, and did not offer
to leave its quarters; it was without hesitation
accommodated with bed and board_When
spring-time came it resumed its free denizenship
of the air, but not ungratefully, for it was always
seen about her garden, and even came fluttering
around its kind mistress when she went out.
Being the male bird, it chose for itself a mate
A nest was built in a hawthorn bush, where four
little ones were reared; sometime after they
were fairly on wing, a gentle tapping was heard
one evening at Mrs. Wilkinson’s casement win
dow. On being opened, to her surprise, in flew
her favorite robin, with his family. They all
received a hearty welcome, and remained there
until spring. This conduct has been pursued
every year since, to the present year; and no
less than eight robins have taken up their winter
quarters in Mrs. Wilkinson’s kitchen. If the
window be not opened, the old robin will perch
upon the latch of the door, and, fluttering with
his wings, jingle it until he is let in ; he perches
upon her shoulder or hand, if she holds it out to
him, and will sing his merry song as if in grate
ful acknowledgement of the hospitality shown
to his co mates and himself. This fact is well
known to every one in the neighborhod.—Lon
don Gar. Chron.
BEAUTIFUL ANECDOTE.
Ahappier illustration of the wonderful character
of the Bible, and the facility with which even a
child may answer, by it, the greatest of questions
and solve the sublimest of mysteries, was perhaps
never given, than at an examination of a deaf and
dumb institution, same years ago in London.
A little boy was asked in writing, «Who
made the world?”
He took the chalk, and wrote underneath the
question,
“ In the beginning, God created the heavens
and the earth.”
The clergyman then inquired in a similar man
ner, “ Why did Jesus Christ come into the
wTorld?
A smile of delight and gratitude rested on the
countenance of the little fellow, as he wrote,
“This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all
acceptation, that Jesus Christ came into the world
to save sinners.”
A third was proposed, evidently adapted to call
his most powerful feelings into exercise—
“ Why were you born deaf and dumb, when I
can hear and speak?”
“Never,” said an eye-witness, “shall 1 forget
the. look of resignation which sat upon his coufr
tenance as he took the chalk and wrote,
“ Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy
sight.”

THE BROTHER AND SISTER.
The following anecdote is related by Mrs.
Child, in one of her New’ York letters to the
Boston Courier:
“ l found the Battery unoccupied, save by
children, whom the weather made as merry as
birds. Every thing seemed moving to the ver
nal tune of
‘ Brivnal hanks arc fresh and fair,
And Gretna woods are green.’
To one who was chasing her hoop, I said,
smiling, ‘You are a nice little girl.’ She stopp
ed, looked up in my face, so rosy and happy, and
laying her hand on her brother’s shoulder, ex
claimed, earnestly,‘And Ac is a nice little boy,
tool’ It was a simple childlike act, but it brought
a warm gush into my heart. Blessings on all
unselfishness I On all that leads us, in love, to
prefer one another. Here lies the secret of uni
versal harmony; this is the disposition which
would bring us all into tune. Only by losing
ourselves can we find ourselves.”
