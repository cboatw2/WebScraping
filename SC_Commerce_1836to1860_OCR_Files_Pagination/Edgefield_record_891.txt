WAsuIoroT, Feb. 17.
to the Senate, this morning, a resolu
tion was adopted giving Mr. Lamar, Ex
President of Texas, the privilege of the
floor.
Mr. Fairfleld submitted a resolution
calling on the Presileti for information as
to whether the British Government has
made satisfaction for the illegal capture of
the fishing schr. Argus.
A number of unimportant matters hav
ing been disposed of, the Froach Spolia
lions bill was taken up.
The question pending was on the mo
tion of Mr. McDuffie, to reconsiier the
vote on the clause appropriating five mil
lions of dollars. lie commenced a speech
againstithe whole bill but the morning hour
having expired, he yielded the floor, and
the consideration of the Texas resolutions
was resumed.
Mr. Woodbury made a powerful speech
in favor of immediate annexation.
Mr. Choate next obtained the floor, but,
preferred speaking to-morrow. So the
subject was laid over.
The remainder of. the day was devoted
to private business. -
in the House, the joint resolution of the
Senate. providing lbr the distribution of
copies of the History or the Exploring
Expedition among foreign Governments,
was taken up and passed with an amend
ient including Texas'and China.
The Senate lill regulating tI.e payment
of pensions in certain cases, was also passed
with some amendments.
The House then resumed the cousidera
lion of the bill to reduce the pay of the
army.
Ar. Adams went for the bill, because
lie thought retrenchment was* necessary in
)his branch of the service. He argued
however, that the majority of the House
- are inconsistent in their profes.,inn of a wish
to reduce the army, when at the samo'time
they are grasping at Oregon and Texas,
measures which will require a great in
crease of the army.
Mr. Rayner, who during the Texas de
bate could not get the floor, seized this
opportunity to get in his intended speech.
le accordingly occupied his hour by a
statement of his reasons against annexation.
Mr. Black, the author o' the hill, after
disclaimiog any idea of reducing the army,
or any thing else other than the correction
of aliuses, moved the previous question,
which was seconfed.
The bill was then read a third time and
passed by a large majority. It is said there
is not the least chance of its passage in the
Senate.
S -WASNGTON e. 18.
In the House, the 'ill providihg $28,000
for lurnishing and repairing the President's
House, tvas -considered in Ciommittee of
the Whole.
Mr. Henley moved to reduce the amount
to $10,000. He supported his amend
nent by a speech. in) which lie vehemently
denounced what he called the extrava
gance hitherto dislilayed in this quarter.
Mr. Jones, of Tennessee, supportei the
amendment. He argued that the simpli
city of our institutions does not warraint
so ~adspla.-Ome ~reqttred;-ai- the
White House. He was also in favor of
reducing the salary of the President to
$20,000 per annum. He thought that
would be enough for any mortal inan.
Mr. Dillinghm contended that the whole
of the money was necessary. lf the peo
ple would build so large a house for the
President, they were boutd to furnish it in
a suitable style. He advocated nothing,
however. but plain substatntial furniiture.
Mr. Douglas contended that the pre
sent state of the White House is such as
to rhortify every one who visits it. lie
said the chairs are broken backed, the
carpets full of holes, amnd the spoons not
fit for use. He was ashamed to hear ob
jections so unworthy of -the magnanimity
of our Governmenit.
Mr. Holmes, of South Carolina moved
to amend by appropriating the White
Ilouse for the use of the Executive De
partment, and providing for a smaller
house for the accommodation of the Presi
dlent, so that we might return to our Re
publican simplicity.
This proposition gave rise to much
.laughter.
Mr. Burl moved to amenv by strikitng
out the sum named in the bill and inserttng
"so much as may be necessary." It was
rejected as were many other proposed
amendments.
Finally, the bill was reported to. the
llouse, when by a vote of602 to 70, it was
rejected. As there was not a full House,
it is probable another bill will be intro
dutced.
* Te rfusl WasutcroY, 'Feb. 19.
Terfslof the House yesterday to
- pass the bill providing for the furnishing
ofthe President's House, h as excited much
indignation -amnong our citizetns of the Dis
trict, who know the dilapidated-conditiot
of the mansion. I am told on- good au
thority that the window curtatns swvarm
with vermin, and the furnitture is in such
a state that no decent man can use it.
In the House, this morning, Mr. Slidell
moved a reconsideration of tho vote by
which the bill was rejectmed. -
ha the course of a discussion which en
sued,* Mr. Pratt, Chairman of the Com
muittee on Public Buildings. said that'such
was the mniserable condition of the House,
thatsh4 had ordered a considerable amount
of furniture on his own inidividual respon
sibility, atid if members refused to pay for
it h'e would.
After further discussion, the vote on the
rejectionl of the bill was reconsidered.
The question again recurring on the pas
sage of the bill, it was a second~time re
jected, by a vote of 75 to 77.
The consideration of the Civil and Di
plomatic Appropriation hill was then re
samed in Committee of the Whole.
The appropriation for the President's
1House was again itntroduced by way of
amendment.
A long discussibn arose as to whether
the furniture ought not to be of American
snanufacture, without regard to the price.
Finally, the amendment was agreed to
so- as to allow $14,000 for furniture, of
American -natiufacture, provided it can be
procured as cheap as foreign articles ; also
$6,000 for painting and repairing the
Mr. Kennedy moved to amend the bill
by inserting $8,000 for continuing in oper

and Baltimore, during the ensuing year,
also instructing the Post Master General
to prepare a list of prices for conveying
intelligence for private individuals, so thal
the income may tucet theexpenditure.
After a brief explanation, the amend
mont was for the present withdrawn.
The Committee then rose, with an un
derslanding that the dehate shull terminate
to-morrow at two o'clock.
In the Senate, after the presentation ol
Petitions and the disposal of other miscel
lancous matters, the Texas annexatior
resolutions were again taken up.
Mr. Henderson having the floor made
nn eloquent speech in favor of the resoln
tions.
Mr. Barrow followed on the othet side

that tle chief cause of opposition to these

COUNTERFEIT NOTES.
A desire having been expiessed, by some
of the North Carolina papers, to be fur
nished with a list and description of the
Counterfeit Bills of the Banks in Soutb
Carolina, in order to prevent imposition
a considerable portion of the circulating
medium of North Carolida, being compo
sed of South Carolina bills-we have ap
plied to one of the offices of the Coinmer
cial Bank, who has politely handed us the
following list:
120's Bank of Charleston, signed J.
hamilton, President, A. G. Rose, Cashier,
payable to T. Street, and dated 18th Nov.
1835. The paper is softer, thinner, and
whiter than in' the genuine notes, which
have a slight yellow tinge, and owing
to this, capse the engraving. which is
rather course, looks too black. They may
be readily detected by the letter r in the
word "or" before "bearer." In the genu
ine notes the extreme end of the r 'turns
down with a dot, whilst in the spurious
ones it turns tip.
$10's on the Planters' and Mechanics'
Bank, signed Daniel Ravenel, President,
and S. r. Robinson, Cashier. payable to
T. leriot, and dated May 28th, 1842.
All that have been seen here are number
ed two hundred and odd. There are sev
eral marks by which they may be infalli
bly known. In the Cashier's signature on
the genuine noes the last stroke-of the
capital letter "R" descends below the
line and surrounds the "0" next to it, in
stead of their being joined in the usual way,
as in the counterfeits. The right hand
end of the good notes has wavid water hues
above and below the wod -iTen," and a
sleeve is represented on the arm of the
hand that holdsthe hitnmer)p the centre
of the lower margin, Jill .of which are
wattting in the counterfeit;.
- 820's Bank of Geortown. The sig
nature of the President. J.W. Coachman,
and the Cashier, D. L.}1'Kny, are very
well imitated, but otherwis9e the bills are
altogether unlike the genuind. the vignette
in the counterfeits being a house with col
umns in front, while in the genuine notes
it is a femalesitting. and a;jhip under full
sail. The ink is blacke;dad the engra.
ving heavier than in the good notes.
820's and $50's Commercial Batik of
Columbia. In these no attempt has been
mode to imitate the genuine bills, of which
the counterfeiters seems to have not even
had one before them when completing the
false notes; for they have the name of J.
Ewari, as Cabbier, whereas all the good
notes are signed J. A. Crawford. The
plate of soine Comnimercial Bank in ano
ther State has been usod, and the words
"Columbia, South Carolina," appear to
have been added with a pen.
85's Bank of Camden, o0dissue. The
engraving of these is geouine, the notes
having bcen lost on the way from the
North to Camden, before they were sign
ed. Some are circulating entirely blank;
others have the name bf the President and
Cashier, but so poorly imitated as to im
pose on no one who is at all familiar with
them.
s1's of the Batik of the State of South
S,)lina, signed Tho. Salmond, President,
and D. L. DeSaussure, Cpsbier, and da
ted Charleston. _Th.Lsawn. isiln.
grapued from an old bill with the State
House as a vignette, and on bad paper, so
that although the general appearance of
the genuine bills is preserved, the least at
tention will discover their baseness.
THE CASE OF DORR.
The act of amnesty by the Legislature
of Rhode Islatnd, in the case of Thea. WV.
Dorr, grants liberty to the prisoner on the
simglc condition of his taking tihe oath of
allegiance to the State. Unon the petition
of the parents of Dorr the act was passed
as follows:
Voted and TesolLved, That the prayer
thereof he so far granted as Thomas WV.
Dorr be liberated frotm his confinement
in the State Prison, ttpon his taking the
following oath or affirmation:
"I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I
will bear true faith and allegiance to the
State of Rhode Island and Providence
Plantations, and that I will support the
Constitution and la ws of this State and of
the United States, so help me Godl, (or this
affirmation I make atnd give upon the
peril of the penalty or perjury.")
Said oath or affirmation shall be ad
iinistered by the Clerk of the Supreme
Court, in open court, sitting thereof in va
cation, and recorded upon the records of
said Cour t in the county in which the said
oath is takeni.
And the Warden of thte State prison is
hereby directed to furnish said Dorr writh
a copy of this resolution, and nwbenever he
shall signify his desire to take said oath or
affirmation, to attend said Dorr before said
Court or Justice, and, upon bis said oath
or affirmation, to discharge hiin according
ly.
The prisoner refused to avail himself of
this act. Hie remains in confintement at
his owt option. The reason given by his
friends is that under the criminal code of
Rhode Island any parson sentenced to im
prisonment in the Penitentiary, for life, or
for one year or more, is thereby incompe
tent to hold office or to vete withinu the
Commonwealth, uniless such 'sentetnce be
revoked. The partianbs of Darr therefore
are niot content with 'his release from
prison ; they call for a reversal of his seo
tence.

THE TWENTY-SCOND OF FEDRUAnY.-rE:
a very brief period since, we witnessed anotlhe
return of the twenty-second of February. 0
this memorable day, was born George Wasi
ington, the saviour of his country. first Pres
dent of thc United States, and the most illum
trious man since the birth of Christ, who hie
figured on the page of history. For or ow
part, we would not commemorate his birtd
with the roll of drums, the roar of artillery, 'i
with boisterous demonstrations of joy. W
would prefer to meditate in silence on the vii
tues of the illustrious hero, iatriot, sage an
christian. We think, that in this manner, w
most approp rintely pay honor to his nemur'
We would enshrine him in our hearts an
think of him as a dearly beloved parent, wh
has bestowed upon its treasQres, earthly thoug

by ho means condemn those who think prope
to pay their respects to the memory of this grev
man, by military display, or various demur
strations of innocent enjoyment Let us a
honor his birth day, but In a tnanner which h
himself would not disapprove. Let us all, t,
whatever party we may belonig, and whateve
portion of this widely extended Union we inn
claim as our homes, venerate the man wh
was "first in war, first in peace, and first in th
affections of his countrymen."

The British Government claims under
discoveries made by Sir Francis Drake,
in 1580. and 1588, and by Capt. Cook, in
1776, neither of whom discovered tire
mouth of the Colutnbia, nor did they land
or take possession, execpt to take in water
The Bri.ish Governmenit never did take
possession of the country at all, and if the
menl sailing along the coast can give a title
then is the right of tho British government
superseded by th Spanish claim,.which is
now ours by purchase.
*In the year 1553, some thirty-five years
previous to ihe discoveries of Drake, two
r Spanish yessels. commanded by Cabrello
and Fer-rello, pnshed their discoveries as
far North as 4:3 o.: 44 degrees, and made
a superficial survey~ of the coast to- this dis
tatnce;. and about the year 1774, some few
-years previotus to the expedition of Capt.
-Cook, Juan Perez. a Spanish navigattor,
sailed along the north west coast, as far as
. the 54th degree of nor-th latitude 39j, dis
t-covered a commodious bay, which he cal
led Port San Lorenzo. Here he remain
ed for sortie time, and traded with- the in
diens. This is the extent of tile Spanish
r claitn, which. we nowv possess, in addition
-to our own title by discovery and actual
posession.
Br. ship Lord Ashurlon on Fire.-T hie
ship, lying at the head of Hagt nod's whar(
was discovered to be on fire, near2 o'clock
yesterday, far aft, and immediately under
the cabin, but how it originated it is im
possible to conjecture. The fire compa
nies were early on the spot, and commen
ced filling the. ship wjih water. 'which they
continued to do until abdnt 5 'cloek in
the afternoon: but after an ineffectual at
tempt to put out the fire. she was,.by order
of the Mayor. who believed that the pro
perty in the vicinity was endangered, rowed
from the wharf by the steamer Charleston
to the opposite side of the city, near Hog
Islani Channel. Her bow was put aground
and her stern where the firb idas confined,
was, we learn. in about 5 fathoms water.
Shortly after being-towed ashore she was
scuttled, for the purpose of submerging
the cotton, and -thus patting out the Sre.
When we left the vessel about 7 o'clock A
last 'evening. 'the opinton iwafs very gener
al that as the fire department had the fames
under their control, she would be saved
The Marion and Palmetto fire companies
having volunteered their services, were
with their "fixing," placed on- board the
steamer Charleston, and left the city with
the ship and we are pleased to add done
good service. The steamer Beaufort Dis
trict and sloop Saniuel Martin were along
side for the purpose of receiving on board
such portion of her cargo is might be saved.
-The Lord Ashburton was consigned to J.
Battershey, Esq. is the largest ship in
port being 1009 ton, and perfeetly new.
ihis being her second voyage. The quar
ter deck and cabin of the ship is consider
ably injured, having been cut in various
places so as to enable the engines to pour
water upon the fire. Her cargo consisted
of 500 bales Sea- Island and 2200 bales .

The Lord' Ashburton.-We are happy
to state that the fire which- was-raging
amongst the cargo of cotton on board this
shi'p, as stated in gur paper of yesterday'
morning, was got under in the course of
the night, and the ship hauled off with the
aid of steam power, and brought to an an
chor opposite the-city. The ship was not
scuttled, but has a large quantity of water
which was thrown into her by the fire en
gines, which must he pumped out, when
she will be taken into dock for repairs.
The cargo has no doubt suferred great
injury both trom fire and water; A strong
forre was engaged - all yesterday, in dis
charging the Cotton into lighters'along

A nother Invention-Colnel Reed, of'
Bostont, has htit upon an inventiott, which
if- successful, is likely to be a formidable
completitor to Mr. Morse's magnetic tele
graph. Its purpose ia to transmnit lettera
and packages any dist ance, wvith :te'apid
ity of lighttning. The Boston Post says:
"The frocess by whicht this-is accom-.
jdished t very simple, consistittg nmerely
of an air-chest, which is charged with ait
by a force pump contiguous to the chest.
When the chest is sufficiently charged
w'ith air the lttrer or package is placed ini
the ti'eder, and it is imediately dischar
ged throttgh the pipe, with great velocity
and perfect safety. Col Reed! the inven
tor, is of opiniun that an outlay of $60,000
w~ould ensure the transmission of letters
and packages between Hoston and Newv
York with perfect safety, in the ai ace of
half an hour.
