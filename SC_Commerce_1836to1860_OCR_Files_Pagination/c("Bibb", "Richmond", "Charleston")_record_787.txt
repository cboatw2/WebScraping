EXTRACTS FROM THE ADDRESS OF PRO
FESSOR MEANS, AT THE LATE COM
MENCEMENT OF THE GEORGIA FE-1
MALE COLLEGE.
On such an occasion as this, then, where so
many hearts are full, where so many young and
sylph-like beings cluster around the matronly
forms who first sheltered their infancy, and kiss
ed away the earliest tear from suffering child
hood’s cheek—where the bloom and the beauty
erf girlhood, long secluded from the parental
home, and its attractive endearments, is now seen,
rapidly expanding under a fond father’s gaze—
intelligence firing the eye, and moulding the
manners, and not infrequently, piety lending its
radiance to the glowing countenance, and throw
ing its rain-bow span over the entire character
of a beloved daughter—who, who shall be strict
to censure, if an occasional gush of warm south
ern feeling should throb in the heart’s pulse, or
mantle on the cheek? What cynical misogy
nist, ever and anon prating about the faults and
the feebleness of the sex, has not lingered, silent,
and unstrung, under the dissolving witchery of
the scene, and heaving a half-suppressed sigh,
mentally invoked the angel spirit which presides
here, to throw its kindly auspices over his cheer
less chamber, and his womanless home ? For
myself, I envy not the condition of that infusible
soul, which can maintain its arctic temperature
amid the vernal sunshine of female worth and
innocence. Let Chimborazo’s ice-bound peaks
sleep on in eternal winter under the glow of a
trophical sky, far from the song of birds, the flow
of fountains, and the blush of flowers ; but give
me the softer, balmier, air where the virgin-snow
flake melts under the glance of Spring, and the
■warm earth teems with happy life under an as
cendant sun.
But let us not be prodigal«>f the passing hour,
nor indulge too long in the delightful train of
emotions which the exhibition just past has so
naturally inspired. Let us analyze our feelings
and scrutinize the extent and bearing of the
causes which have produced them. What then
have been the considerations which have awak
ened so intense an interest in so intelligent an
audience ? Are these public demonstrations of
unfeigned pleasure, but the transient admiration
which moves the crowd under the clumsy tricks
of the juggler or the buffoon? Have we here
the wild and licentious burst of passion that
breaks from the box or the pit, amid the glare
and the throng of the midnight drama ? Or do
the sparkling eyes and bounding hearts around
me, derive their inspiration from the flying heels
of a German waltzing Miss ? No, indignantly
we answer no ! The very sanctity of these halls,
and the dignified assemblage of private and pub
lic worth before me, promptly repel the slander
ous imputation. Holier motives have brought
us here, and higher themes retain us.
The ampler developement of the female mind
and the careful cultivation of the female heart,
by a regular course of educational training, and
in an institution of high grade and efficient capa
bilities, organized and perpetuated amid the insti
tutions of our fathers, and under the control of
habits and tastes, congenial with the generous
and open spirit of the South, have long claimed,
and at length won, the attention of the popular
mind, and a liberal contribution from the popu
lar purse. The progress of this benevolent
scheme has for several years been submitted to
the inspection of the public eye, and to-day in
vites to appropriate reflections connected with
its success.
Amongst tnose savage nations wnere igno
rance has maintained unbroken dominion over
the torpid and untaught faculties of the human
mind, the sensual natures and coarse perceptions
of the stronger sex, have ever failed to estimate
the true character of woman, or accord to her,
her merited place in society. Brute, force and
Jibdinous passions have given cast to national
habits, and the highest characteristics of a wife
have been her uncomplaining endurance of toil,
and her crouching subserviency to her lounging
lord—traversing sea-shore, fen and mountain,
amid scorching suns, and soaking dews, to fur
nish fuel for his warmth, or limpets and sea
eggs for his gluttonous meal, while herself, the
trembling menial who supplies them, stands
“ dripping and famished” at his elbow, content
to receive the rejected fragments as the price of
her toil. Just as mankind have emerged, how
ever, from the shadows of intellectual and moral
night, has the condition of woman been meliorat
ed, and her rights respected. But it was reserved
for Christianity alone, to elevate and refine the
degraded nations—to throw the soft mellow
light of a universal benevolence over the dissolv
ing rigors of the heart’s long winter—widen the
horizon of human happiness, and fling the arch
of promise over the distant sky of the future.
Under her halcyon reign, mind has been eman
cipated from the terrors of superstition, and tried
its elastic energies upon a new and a vast arena.
Breadth of muscle, and fierceness of spirit no
longer constitute the standard of greatness, nor
the test of virtue, but the whole length and
breadth of human character is graduated by the
scale of a purer philosophy, and shines in the
light of a revealed immortality. The true con
nections and dependencies of life are clearly ex
hibited. The complicated but interesting rela
tionships, designed to interlock the earth’s great
family in the bonds of social brotherhood, have
.been recognized and cherished. The very soul
of society has been analyzed—every harmoniz
ing attribute dignified and consecrated, and every
discordant element rebuked and anathematized.
Here, then, under the very light of the Cross,
and the searchings of the sanctuary, is the ex
cellency of female character announced, and its
importance to the happiness of the world, sanc
tioned by the high rank which woman is author
ized to assume, and the affectionate control which
she is permitted to exercise over the heart and
conduct of the other sex. Nor would we wil
lingly enter upon the vexed and unnecessary
question, involving the mental equality or ine
quality of the sexes. A difference of intellectual
structure, however, certainly does not necessarily
imply inferiority of endowments. The compar
ative imperfection or deficiency of some powers
of the mind or affections of the heart, in either
man or woman, when compensated by an am
pler development of others equally valuable to
society, cannot destroy the general equiponde
rance of the sexes. It surely cannot detract,
therefore, from the relative importance or valua
ble powers of the female mind, to admit that the
legitimate sphere of its movements, is neither the
mazes of mathematics, the intrigues of the cabi
net, nor the carnage of the field. Once in a cen- \
tury, it is true, a Sommerville may quit the gen
tle walks and quiet duties of her sex—scale the
dizzy heights of the calculus, and emulate a
Kepler and La Place in tracing the flight of
planetary worlds, and measuring the profound
depths of ether:—an Elizabeth, rise from the ;
retirement of a prison to regulate the diplomacy
of empires, and inscribe her country’s name upon
the catalogue of national greatness—or a Mar
garet of Anjou consent to face the hot breatu of
battle, and steel her nerves to the shrieks of the
dying; but these are moral monstrositieser
ratic planets which have shot from their orbits,
to wander in the light, and borrow the splendor
of other spheres. I
Liet it tie admitted that the heavy muscles and
strong sinews of the male sex, fit them for the
fatigues of commerce, the toils of agriculture, and
the “ tug of war.” That either by original con
stitution, conventional habits, or disciplinary
training, they ordinarily manifest greater vigor
and boldness of thought, patience of application,
and profoundness of research—intellectual capa
bilitfts, indispensable to the honorable mainte
nance of the station assigned them by the wisdom
of Providence and the usages of civilized society,
where tho intricate and endless science of gov
ernment is to be studied, and its high executive
functions discharged—where the depths of phil
osophy are to bo sounded—the resources of agri
culture drained—the tortuous channels of com
merce threaded, and its extensive bearings upon
national prosperity sedulously traced, where, in
fine, the glory or the disgrace of a country’s legis
lation, the defence of its invaded territories, and
the freedom or the slavery of its people are sus
pended upon the wisdom of men’s counsels, and
the energy of their execution. But does it there
fore follow, in summing up the whole attributes
of woman’s mind, and the qualities of woman’s
heart, in view of the wide and diversified inter
ests of human life, that the aggregate should fail
to furnish an entire counterpoise to the mental
and moral endowments of her boasting protec
tor 1 Surely not. She moves in her own
sphere and fulfils her own high destiny. Pre
tentionless and retiring she shuns the public
gaze, and courts not the plaudits of the shouting
multitude.
And while the heart of her lordly compeer is
thrilling amid the thunder of drums, or bound
ing under the roar of applauding senate-houses,
her gentle nature softly and silently as the night
dews of Egypt, is distilling its refreshing and
fertilizing influence over the thirsty soil of public
morals, and spreading smiles and cheerfulness
throughout a grateful land.
The indulgence of opposite tempers and pas
sions would necessarily lead to the adoption of a
corresponding career in which they might de
velope themselves. And should the ill-fated hour
ever come, when the mellifluous tones of her
soothing voice shall be exchanged for the voci
ferous brawlings of the political demagogue ;
the magic spell of her melting eye, and the mar
ble polish of her placid brow, for the warriors
flash, and the warriors frown, farewell—a long
farewell to the potency and charms of woman.
Unfeminized and fallen, “ sic transit gloria
mundi” may be written upon the tomb of her
departed virtues. The very circle in which
men move, and the posts of honor and emolu
ment open to their occupancy, present a thou
sand stimuli to prurient ambition, and the glitter
ing heights of place and power are often reached
by adventurers whose strategy and finesse,
rather than their dignity and intelligence,.have
secured their elevation. No sooner invested
with the. toga of office, amid the flourish of trum
pets and the wild hosannahs of the partizan
crowd, than they entrench themselves behind
their official prerogatives, and, under .cover of
this breastwork, their deadly artillery effectively
rakes the waning ranks of injured and outraged
multitudes who have dared to withhold their suf
frage, or honestly to maintain opposite political
opinions. True, the world does homnge at the
footstool of power, and gazes in awe upon the
insignia of state, but derives not its happiness
from the one or the other. For it is not the
imposing and the sublime, either in the world
of mind or matter that contributes most to the
well being and comfort of our race. Such ex
hibitions (often of questionable, if not of ruinous
tendency,) are at best but of brief duration and
limited utility. While the most powerful and
efficient agencies on earth, either in the physical
or moral world, produce their grand results by
a quiet, steady, unobtrusive movement. The
plunge and the crash of the mountain avalanche,
from its Alpine height, may startle, and terror
strike the inhabitants of the valley, and leave its
icy ruins to excite the speculations of some wan
dering philosopher, while the same pure element
crystalized in the skies, and descending like
showers of eider-down, over half a continent,—
still and hush as the breath of midnight, softly
i folds the shivering earth in its fleecy mantle, and
shields the germs of tender vegetation from the
fiercer coldness of the wintry winds, until its
guardian warmth is exchanged for the robes of
spring, and smiling harvests proclaim its silent,
but extensive worth. The application, I trust,
is easy. Woman’s agency is mild and peaceful,
but active, diffusive, constant, powerful; and
though no earthquake follows her thread, nor
warning thundershocks herald her approach,
like the noiseless light of Heaven she silently
wraps the world in her charms, and tinges its
morals with the hues that beautify her own.
Society is incomplete without her; a mere char
coal-sketch of human existence, until the softly
blended colorings of her radiant character, adorn
the canvas, and give life and animation to the
whole. She intermingles the amiable traits of
her milder nature, to attemper the rougher pas
sions of the other sex : regulates their tastes,
modifies their opinions, and moulds their habits :
represses the buddings of vice and fosters the
germs of virtue. It is hers too, exclusively
hers, to hallow the sanctuary of home, and throw
the spell of unconscious enchantment over the
whole family circle—unbending the brow of a
care-worn husband, and soothing the sorrows of
parental age" and decrepitude :—pillowing the
cheek of helpless infancy on her sympathizing
bosom, and pouring the impressive light of con
stant, living example upon the forming charac
ter of the young and confiding around her,until,
like sunbeams upon the diamond, it becomes in
corporated with the very texture of their moral
being, to be radiated in improved lustre upon
after generations. But let us not be misunder
stood. We design no empty, fulsome, indis
criminate panegyric upon the sex. Nor do we
court the ephemeral honors of that non-descript,
sycophantic compound of man, insect and swal
low,—the bowing, buzzing, chattering creature,
modernly styled a “ Lady's Man." Yet we
have nothing to conceal, and if propriety author
ized the disclosure, and the warm feelings, of our
hearts were transferred to the tongue of the town
clock for utterance, it might fling it upon the
winds, uWe love and admire the sex. But
mark us,—it is woman as she should be, that
commands our homage. Woman, as the elas
ticity and scope of her mental and moral powers
authorize her to be—Woman, as Christianity’s
voice reveals her, and its baptismal touch re
fines her: and, thank Heaven, woman, as we
have often been permitted to meet her.
Point us not then, in disparagement of the
claims we advocate, to the Billingsgate fish
monger—the foul and degraded creature who
retains the form but has lost the soul of her sex.
As well designate yon stunted, misshapen
shrub in a Florida jungle, whose bark and leaf
are those of the sister tree, to represent the ma
jesty of her queenly evergreen, whose columnar
trunk and fragrant bloom overtops the glories of
the forest.
Nor annoy us with the other extreme:—yon
vacant, sickly, sentimental thing, which flaunts
in ribbons and laces,. formed it would seem,
Venus-like, from the floating froth on fashion’s
tide,—whose vapory figure bends to the passing
breeze, and whoss tremulous nerves are spasmed
at the cricket’s chirp. A creature of ghosts,
and gew gaws—beaus and bandboxes, who has
only lived in an artificial world, and never met
the realities of life—whose only intellectual food
has been the stimulating julips, or the mawkish
sweets served up for morbid palates by a Bulwer
or a Marryat. No, my audience, no ! we can
not consent to degrade the picture by such dis
torted caricatures of the sex. The world de
mands a soberer, graver estimate of female
worth, and the age is prepared to receive it. So
late as the 17th century it may, perhaps, be truly
said, the perfection of female attainments consist
ed in a thorough knowledge of “ pickling and
preserving, cross-stick and embroidery.” But a
more liberal age and riper intelligence, have ac
knowledged much higher capabilities than those
which are required to constitute the seamstress
or the house-keeper, however valuable and ap
propriate these domestic accomplishments. Ge
nius and learning are accorded to them. And
designed as equals and companions for their hus
bands, and stationed as they are around the fam
ily altar to guard the vestal fire of infant purity
and direct its young flame to Heaven, cultivated
minds, refined tastes, and unaffected piety are
deemed indispensable to qualify them for their
high and delicate trust. Education, in the
broad, comprehensive and only appropriate sig
nification of the term, is in all civilized countries
the great formative instrumentality, which gives
cast and character to the popular mind. To be
effective and thorough, its plastic power and'
diversified appliances must be commenced in
early childhood, and prosecuted with affectionate
but sleepless vigilance, until the happy subjects
of its care and solicitude are introduced upon the
great theatre of life, to become the exemplars and
guides of others. And any system of instruction
which embraces not within the range of its
teachings the whole bearings of human charac
ter, and the entire connections of human life—in
volving in its culture the physical, moral and in
tellectual faculties—providing for individual
comfort as well as social weal, and crowning and
sanctifying the whole, by daily lessons for “ the
world to come”—falls far short of the claims of
an intelligent and immortal people.
The diminutive Laplander, it is true, is re
garded as having attained the “ ultima Thule"
of a national education when he has learned to
guide the restive reindeer over his snowy wastes,
and plant the flimsy timbers of his smoky tent.
Or the wild New Hollander, when his sinewy
hand directs the whizzing spear to the target’s
centre, and pilots his bark canoe over the angry
surf. But in other lands, where Revelation’s
sun has “ spread his beams athwart the gloom
profound,” and revealed the exhaustless resour
ces, stupendous powers, and deathless destiny of
the human mind, Education assumes loftier pre
tensions, and presents solemn and resistless
claims upon public attention.
In the midst of the free and venerable institu
tions which distinguish “ our own,” “our native
land,”theadvanges offered for a full and “happy
developement of the female character” are per
haps unrivalled on the globe. The high natural'
endowments so generally the birth-right ol the!
American fair—“ the general tone of equality”
1 maintained “ in our intercourse with them—the
just confidence reposed in them by the public
mind, and the facinating control which elegance,
grace, and cultivation must ever exert over the
other sex, all invite them to a high and enviable
rank in society.”
Suffer me here, disgressivcly to remark, that
! the noblest specimens and utmost excellences of
human character, embracing all the phases and
aspects of its existence, from its most sublime
conceptions and heroic darings, down to its most
I delicate and microscopic details—from its loftiest
and boldest proportions, through the long range
of its manifestations, till we reach its softest,
sweetest, loveliest forms, where innocence sleeps
upon the bosom of Beauty, and Charity holds
rein over the hallowed affections, all, all de
pend upon the happy combination of the peculiar
and distinctive characteristics of both sexes,
constituting a sort of duality of existence, which,
like the Siamese Twins, can never be severed
but at the peril of life to each.

CLASS MEETINGS—NO. IV.
The second class of duties, which appertain to
the office of a leader, relate to the societies in
general; but, for fear that the subject may be
carried out to an unnecessary length, we pass
over this, and take up the third class: viz. the
duties of leaders to the individual members of
their own classes. It will be readily observed,
that these are not such as belong to the Chris
tian ministry or pastorate; but, they are subor
dinate, and assistant to those of the pastoral
office. Leaders are not called upon to expound
the Holy Scriptures, to define the doctrines of
the gospel, nor to administer the Lord’s supper
to the societies, or the ordinance of baptism to
their children. These are the duties of such as
are wholly set apart to the work and office of
Christian pastors. In subordination to them,
they are set over the classes to assist the mem
bers generally by their prayers, exhortations,
admonitions, and advices in the great concerns
of religion. It is then the duty of the Leader
First: To hold Christian communion with
his class, and to retain them in connection with
our church. Our “ general Rules” are very
explicit on this point. They require that this
communion shall be held by a weekly meeting
for relating experience, for exhortation and j
prayer. And it is very important that the j
leader be regular in his attendance at this
weekly meeting of his class: he should never
be absent without informing the people that an
inevitable cause detains him, and, in that case,
he should, if possible, get a brother leader, or a
private member, who may be qualified, to fill
his place; but, in case of a failure to effect such
an arrangement, if convenient, the preacher
should be informed of it, so that they may not
retire without being mei. No member should
be allowed to be absent without giving a satis
factory excuse: this they know is a reasonable
requisition, and they will expect it; when any
of them are absent twice or thrice and the lea
der is not informed of the cause, he should em
brace the earliest opportunity of paying them a
visit. They may be sick, or in trouble, and
have not means of informing him; they may
have been seduced by temptation and feel asham
ed to meet in class; they may be slackening
their pace and becoming weary in well-doing :
in any of these cases a visit from the leader may \
prove of essential benefit. It is to be feared that
many persons are lost from our communion
every year, tor want of a seasonable visit from
their leaders. In several places, where it has
been our lot to labour, we have found the lea
ders very remiss in visiting their members, es
pecially when they have absented themselves
from the weekly meetings, and in times of sick
ness. In the regular leader’s meetings, the
preacher often knows more about the sick and ]
delinquent members than the leader himself
“ Brethren, these things ought not so to be.”
In the relation of Christian experience, as well
as in a general intercourse with the members,
the conduct of the leader should be such as will
tend not only to encourage and stimulate them
in the divine life; but strengthen their attach-1
ment to the body to which they belong. To j
important part of his duty; and while he uses
no means to induce the memoers of other
churches to connect themselves with ours, he
should, when it is called for, use every means in
his power to prevent our people from going
over to them. This may seem rather selfish in
the eyes of some ; but two reasons msy be as
signed for it:
(1.) The members of our classes are to a
great extent) children of Methodism : they were
brought to God by that ministry which is estab
lished among us ; they were gathered out of the
world, into *our church fellowship ; they owe
their spiritual all, to our church, under God,
and are bound to us by the strongest ties of grati
tude ; and when they leave us, unless in the case
of some conscientious or material change of sen
timent as to our doctrine or discipline they com
mit an act of injustice; they forsake their father’s
house and family, and go to dwell among
strangers.
(2.) We are of opinion they cannot improve
their condition, by separating from us, and join
ing other denominations. Where will they find
securer sheep-folds, richer pastures, better tend
ed flocks, or more diligent, affectionate, and
faithful shepherds ? Where will they find equal
privileges, with lighter burdens 1 More oppor
tunities of doing and getting good 1 It is a no
torious fact that, of all the members who have
left our communion from time to time, not one
single one has been led to this step, because the
means of grace in the church were not abundant
and conducive to spirituality and growth in
communion with us, is an
grace ; or uecause me ministry was not iaiimui
and efficient in the discharge oftheir duties.
Second : It is the leader’s duty to watch over
the experience and practice of his members, to
the end that both may accord with the word of
God. In the course of time he will become
familiar with a great variety of cases in religious
experience; and it is a matter of no small mo
ment that he be able to deal wisely, faithfully,
and affectionately with all of them. Some per
sons join our society whose convictions of sin
are very superficial. In times of revival they
may have been awakened to a sense oftheir
danger and induced to join the church and attend
class, more because of the sympathy and kind
ness which they met with, than from an earnest
desire to flee the wrath to come. They should
be tenderly dealt with. Means should be used
to deepen their religious impressions, and bring
them to taste the joys of pardoned sin. With
this class no time is to be lost. If they are not
soon converted, the probability is, they will soon
get tired and fell back into the world. There
are others whose awakenings seem to be deep
and scriptural, and yet they make little or no
progress in seeking the pardon of sin. Others
are troubled with doubts and fears, and cannot
exercise faith enough to obtain an assurance of
their acceptance with God. They are regular
in their attendance on all the means of grace;
yet, there appears to be no variation in their
state from week to week. In such a case, the
leader should seek to ascertain the cause. He
should not only converse with them in class, but
visit them at home, and talk freely, affection
ately and searchingly on all points of difficulty.
In this way all obstacles may soon be removed.
There are yet others whose professions of par
don and regeneration he will find reason to ques
tion. These should be faithfully dealt with, and
I spoken to, more upon the practical fruit of
righteousness than upon the comforts of religion.
| Many will be found who give strong evidence
of a real change of heart, andVet their progress
in holiness is tardy and unsatisfactory. Others
there are, who have back-slidden from God,
though they may not be chargeable with any
j outward sin.
| In order to ascertain the various features of
i these several cases and remove all obstacles to
i religious enjoyment, the leader will have need
i of much prayer, patience, tenderness and knowl
edge of human nature. Finally, he should
strenuously press upon all, the duties of the
closet—reading the scriptures daily; self-ex
amination, meditation and prayer: the duties ol
the family—instructing and catechizing their
children, exercising a righteous discipline over
them and daily worshipping God with them:
their church duties—respect for God’s ministers,
diligent attendance upon his public ordinances,
strict observance of his sabbaths, love to his peo
ple and fellowship with his saints: their civil
duties—truth, honesty and industry in their
worldly callings, due subjection and obedience
to their superiors.
Third : The last duty of a leader to his mem
bers which we shall notice is, to afford them his
counsel in difficulty, and his sympathy in trou
ble. He should study to gain their confidence,
and teach them to consider him as their friendly
adviser in the affairs of this life, as well as
“a helper of their faith and joy." “Let your
young members know that you will expect them
to apply for your counsel before they take any
important step in life, whether as it relates to
marriage or to business; and in any matter con
cerning which you may deem yourselves incom
petent to decide, or which may be of such conse
quence as to render it desirable that the judg
ment of others should be obtained, apply to your
ministers for their counsel. Upon general sub
jects, their information and experience qualify
them to be the best counsellors; and in affairs'
of trade, in which they may not be competent
judges, they have access to the most upright and
best informed tradesmen in the society, and can
obtain for you the advantage of their superior
skill. Show great kindness to those who have
to struggle with frequent and strong temptation:
they are prone to write bitter things against
themselves because of their temptations and to
consider them as marks of God’s displeasure, or
as indications of a very low state of grace ; and
if you are not kind and sympathetic at such
times, you will greatly aggravate their trouble.
Be particularly attentive to your afflicted mem
bers. Never let them have cause to complain of
neglect in the day of adversity ; frequently visit
them and take care to inform your minister of
their affliction, that they may carry the consola
tions of Christ to his “ suffering saints.” “ We
exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly,
comfort the feeble-minded, support the weak, be
patient toward all men. See that none render
evil for evil unto any man, but ever follow that
which is good, both among yourselves, and to
all men.” 1 Thess. v. 14,15.

FUNERAL SERMONS AGAIN—REPLY
TO B.
Mr. Editor,—The last number of the South
ern Christian Advocate contains an article in
reply to one written nearly a year ago by Cleri
cus, against the practice of preaching funeral
sermons. It is somewhat to be regretted that
the reply did not appear at 9n earlier period, as
the article which arew it forth, has, no doubt,
well nigh escaped the memory of all its readers.
But believing yet, that the discussion may do
good, if properly conducted, we proceed to an
swer some of B’s principal arguments in favor of
the practice.
B. is mistaken in supposing that C. threw out
a “ challenge,” when he says, “ if there be one
who under such circumstances has not wounded
his conscience by saying too much for the dead,
or too little for the claims of God’s law, he is
invited to cast the first stone at these views, if he
dislikes them, and continue to pelt them as long
as he wishes, but the guilty have no right to as
sail them." His only object was to elicit truth,
by having his erroneous opinions corrected, if
they were such.
He is again mistaken in supposing from the
words just quoted, that C. charges all who
preach funeral sermons, with dissembling. On
the contrary, he believed that there were not a
few who were innocent, many of whom he hoped
however, would not “ dislike” his views, and
consequently would not assail them, and as for
the guilty, he thought they had no right to do
so, whethet they disliked them or not.
Yet B. himself, comes well nigh charging all
his ministering brethren with guilt in this mat
ter ; for he argues fhat the failure of a reply to
this challenge, “ goes far to show that conscious
ness of blame held back the pen.” C. however,
had supposed the reasons were, that some of the
ministers considered the matter of too little con
sequence, that others did not “ dislike” his views,
ana that others again, felt themselves guilty, and
had no right to reply.
With the ink scarcely yet dry, which record
ed this severe reflection upon his brethren,
B. adds, “ place the true minister where you
may,.even if, like Paul, he is in chains before a
tribunal, or John before Herod, he will declare
the whole truth, though he lose his head for its
sake.” Taken in connection, this is a hard say
ing ; but it is charitably believed that he did not
intend the conclusion that follows,—that all those
who “ held back the pen from a consciousness ol
blame," were not true ministers. It is almost
certain that it was only a lapsus meri t is, to which
! the wisest and best of men are occasionally
liable.
ne liiiuriire iicai, uiui in uruui iu mu
matter whether funeral sermons were productive
of more harm than good, he “ asked four differ
ent congregations the following question, “ How
! many in this congregation, under the preaching
of funeral sermons at any time, have been con
victed thereby and convinced that they needed a
better preparation for eternity, to let it be known
by rising to their feet, 1st congregation, 5,—2d,
30,—3d, 31,—4th, 38,—rose to testify, that
through the preaching of funeral sermons God
had convictea them." After all the demonstra
tion the result of this experiment was to carry
with it, how vaguely is the whole matter stated!
For first, he does not clearly inform us whether
those persons had been only convicted (and to
this view we shall hold until corrected,) or
whether they had been converted under funeral
sermon^or whether they were converted at all.
Nor secondly, does he inform us what propor
tion the numbers who rose, bore to the whole
-" ’ 7
congregation. Until we are more (tally enlight
ened on these points, we consider (hither reply
unnecessary. After having thus established tha
feet that people can be convicted under funeral
sermons, he comes to the conclusion, that they
cannot therefore be wrong. Now it does seem
to us that there should have been no occasion for
reminding B., that there need have been no con
troversy between us on this point. He should
have remembered that C. sets out in his article
with the admission that, since funeral sermons
are neither enjoined or forbidden in the word
of God, that they cannot in themselves, be either
“good or bad”—that they are “ lawful,” and that
he himself would not object to them if they were
always confined to decidedly pious persons. And
moreover, that it was not to the sermons them
selves, abstractly considered, that he obiected:
but the temptations such occasions too frequently
offered to ministers to dissemble, by exceedingor
withholding truth, either from an undue concern
for theif popularity, (for the best of men are but
men)*or from “ the fear of man which bringeth
a snare,” or from a commendable sympathy for
bereaved friends, and a desire to comfort them,
inducing them either to eulogize extravagantly
the virtues of the deceased, or to overlook his
faults, or to speak too favorably of his dying
prospects, thereby injuring their own character
for truth and fidelity, or confirming the irreli
gious in a course of procrastination and sin. .
But B. supposes that “ true ministers” will not
do this. Here we confess, we are fairly at
issue ; and though we areawarethat we are plac
ing ourselves in a most unenviable attitude, by
becoming “ the accuser of the brethren,” we
must contend for our position. But here, we
dare do no more than whisper to B., that if the
nature of the case would justify our doing so, we
could inform him of the defaults of “ true minis
ters” at this point, which have come within the
range of our own knowledge, that would cause
his ears to tingle again. Indeed we are sur
prised how any one can doubt the possibility of
good men, and true ministers, being, by theforce
of temptation “ carried away with dissimula
tion,” when we remember that Aaron dissembled
about the golden calf and Peter and Barnabas
about a matter of far less consequence, and that
we are all men of like passions with them.
We suppose all will admit, that among the
greatest obstacles to men’s salvation, are delu
sion and presumption ; the one gendering carnal
security, and the other fostering a spirit of pro
crastination. Or in other words, that the deceit
fulness and wickedness of the human heart,
almost constantly incline it either delusively to
rely upon its supposed virtues for acceptance
with its Maker, or presumptuously to defer a
preparation for judgment to the dying hour.
Now how does it behove us, especially as minis
ters, to avoid every thing which would give any
sort of countenance to these deep-iooted and soul
destroying evils 1 To be more particular, how
careful should we be not to speak of the amiable
qualities or good deeds of deceased irreligious
persons in such a way, as to give the least sha
dow of hope to the Pharisaical sinner that he
may be saved by his own righteousness, or by
the works of the law. And equally important
is it, that we speak not of the dying repentance
of sinners and backsliders in such a manner, as
to favor the prevalent delusion that we may
almost infallibly be saved at the eleventh hour.
And now we are willing to appeal to all the
readers of this article who have attended many
funerals, and have strictly observed the remarks
of the preacher in reference to the dead, whether
such remarks have always, or even generally,
perhaps, been characterized by a careful avoi
uunce oi every uung wmcn wouia iavour aem
sion or presumption. Who has not at some time,
on such occasions, heard him so relate the good
qualities, or good deeds of deceased sinners as to
leave ample room for depraved human nature to
infer that they were either saved, or that their
punishment was comparatively slight And
who again, has not occasionally heard him
speak so favorably of the dying experience of
sinners and backsliders, as to strengthen that fond
and ruinous mistake, that death-bed repentance
is an easy matter. And yet, it would be exceed-,
ingly unkind to deny that many of these were
“ true ministers." That “ charity which hopeth
all things,”—that gracious sympathy which in
clines us to “ weep with them that weep," and to
“ heal the broken-hearted,” will often (apart
from other reasons) almost unconsciously lead
us astray here.
Again, if we allow ourselves to speak favour
ably at all of the lives or death of those whose
funeral sermons we preach, how liable are we
to be deceived by the representations of their
friends! leaving their motives for doing so to be
judged at another tribunal. But thus it often
happens that the minister’s character for faithful
ness and truth, in the judgment of his congre
gation, is made to bleed at every pore.
Besides, we do not hesitate to offer the opin
ion, that the very best motive for having funeral
sermons preached, in nine cases out of ten, is a
mere comformity to a long established usage, or
the fear of apparent disregard for the dead.—
Moreover, how does it often interfere with the
regular appointments of the preacher I We
have a brother now in our mind, who expects
next sabbath to preach the sixth funeral sermon
of six successive weeks, which had been attended
with considerable inconvenience to himself, and
the most of these were children, who did “ not
know their right hand from their left."
And now in conclusion, we would enquire of
B., whether because we may not preach funeral *
sermons, we need preach fewer sermons?—
Whether we need preach “ Jesus and the resur
rection,” any the less 1 Whether we may not
still do so “ among the graves,” if we prefer call
ing our congregation thither ? Ana whether
he could not as effectually, without a funeral
sermon, have informed the mother who was in
despair over her little child just dead, that ‘ she
could go to it.’ And lastly, whether the same ser
mons would not probably have done as much
good, if they had not been called funeral ser
mons 1
Finally, still considering them productive of
more harm than good, and being unable to per
ceive any medium and safe ground we can take,
if we preach them at all, we are still determined,
let others do as they may, to “ preach no more
funeral sermons." Clericus.
