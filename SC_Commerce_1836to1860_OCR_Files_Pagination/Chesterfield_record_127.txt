The recent suspension of specie payments
by the banks of New York, Philadelphia, i3os
ton aud Baltimore, which cannot fail to become
general throughout the United States,
presents a state of things, which may, if publie
opinion be not led in a proper direction, ^
involve the most fatal and disasterous results, jj
The country will shortly bo divided into three u
great parties?one advocating the destruction
of all banks, and the scheme of a currency a,
solely metalic; and the second supporting the ^
* doctrine of a permanent incontrovertible paper
system, and a third, urging the restora
tion of specie payments by the banks at the
cariicst possible period at which it can be ef. cj
fectcd, with the least injury to the public. Of
these plans, the first is impracticable, and the
second would be ruinous to the industry, capital,
and morals of the country. The third is ^
the only one that is both practicable and exf
pedient, and the one that calls for the united
energies of all the advocates of conservative jG
principles, and of all who respects the rights
of industry, the rights of property, ar.d the j,.
laws of moral obligation. Entertaining those ! "
sentiments, the advertiser proposes to publish ; 0,
a semi-monthly journal, to be mainly devoted, j v
for the present, to the accomplishment of tins j
great end; and he confidently relies upon the i ol
patronage of a large number of his fellow cit- 1
lr.ens to sustain him in the effort. All who j *
unite with Jiiin in sentiment must be aware of j j
the importance of prompt ar.<l energetic* ac-1 e,
tion, and of the immediate and wide dilution j
of knowledge upon tiie principles of currency, j a)
. Ignorance on this subject has brought us to i
oar present bankrupt condition, and nothing
can save us from deeper and more lasting distress,
but the dissemination of the important aj
truths which, reason and experience have ^
taught in reference *10 banking, currency and j (
li nance. " |

PROPOSE!; BIBLE CONVENTION.
A Circular prepared by direction of the Charleston
li bit Society.
Charleston, May 1837.
Sir:?The Managers of tiio Charleston Bible
Society, have appointed the undersigned, a committee
to prepare and send fortii a Circular, invitii'tf
t!ie several Bihlc Societies in the State to
unite with them by their delegates, in a Convention,
to be held at Columbia, on Tues^ y the 5th
December 1837.
liie objects to be secured bv such a Convention.
arc to ascertain what has been done in this
State for the l ist lour or lire years in giving
circulation to the Bible; what facts may be collected,
which will throw light upon our yet ro
maining destitutions; whether it is expedient, to
?ngago simultaneously in resupplying t ho State
with the Word of Life upon a plan si.viLr to
that which was agreed upon in Columbia, several
years ego; and if so, by what means and by what
agencies tho plan can be most firliy and thoroughly,
and judiciously carried into effect, so
that our entire reading popul it ion, have ffv" access
to copies of the Hoiy Script urea, in nhehr
*?n:ssr?K*?Mn_ And final!v to lUTdicrate upon
any otlwr subject connected with the diihsiohj
of the Bible, whether at home or abroad, in
Christian or in heathen lands.
Tin general fact is known, that districts of
country, which have been thoroughly supplied
one yenrhave contained many destitute ftniilias
he next; and what is true of one district, is true
of all the rest, cs the same causes operate to ere.
ate the want, viz: the formation of now families,
tho immigration of others, and the wearing out 01
the Bihl s themselves In most eases where a
re-supply lias been uadcrtakcn, after an interval
of four or five years, the destitution has been
found full half as great as at the period of the
original supply, and insomo cases greater, fiom
I the causes already assigned. We allude to this
I fact because it was one of the principal motives
which induced the Managers oftho Charleston
Bible Socief v to propose a convention.
The Committee regard it as superfluous to urge
the subject upon vour consideration bv any fur.
thor remarks, as ail the reasons for a Convention,
which we could submit, must be farniiliar to your
mind. All that we have so solicit, is, that you
would call tlio attention of your society to the
proposition, that should they deem it expedient,
delegates may be appointed to represent your So.
ciety in the Convention.
We have the honor to subscribe ourselves, in
name, and by the appointment of the Managers
of the Charleston Bible Society your fellow la.
borers in the Bible cause.

CONTEXTS. II
1. The Financial Register will contain the J
annual report of the Secretary of the Treasu- i
ry on the finances, and the Directors of the '
Mint on the coinage, and eucli parts of the P
President's Messages, and other public docu- e
ments and acts of Congress as relates to
tlie finances, banking, the currency, coinage, ?
and collateral subjects.
2. Abstracts from the annual commercial ^
statements, showing the extent of the com- ;)
merce and navigation of the United States.
3. Abstracts from the reports annually made t]
to the different state Legislatures on the condition
of the State banks, sufficient to show n
their actual condition. n
4. An account of the debt of the different
states, and of their investments in rail road?, p
canals, &c., as infonnation may be acquired.
5. Weekly quotations of the sales at N.York *

and distant, sold in those markets, as also, bills
of exchange, foreign and domestic, as well s
as the rate of interest of monev in the mar- ,

There were on the 1st of J ar.ua ly, 1S37, in !
the different states and territories of the Un-! ion,
six hundred end seventy-seven ineorpcra- j
ted banks, having one hundred and forty-six ,
branches, dependent of one anotiier, each of; ^
which issues notes, and consequently eontri.
hutes towards the mass of the paper currency,
which will soon exclusively fiil the entire clian- : p
nels of circulation; and it is evident that a a
knowledge ofjnuch of the statistical inforrna- lr
tioa which is connected with their expansions Vta

every section of our country, as well as to ! a!
merchants and capitalists abroad. A knowi- i ai

in the various enterprizes requiring capital,
in which our different states h ive embarked,
would seem to be essential to all our monied Jinstitutions,
and to a large body of our citizens w
and public men. Indeed, without a broad u.
view of the condition of the currency in both Vi
quarters of the world all great financial en- u
terprises must be conducted in the dark; and ci
when this is the case, it is easy to perceive j?i
what disasters rriay follow in their train. it
