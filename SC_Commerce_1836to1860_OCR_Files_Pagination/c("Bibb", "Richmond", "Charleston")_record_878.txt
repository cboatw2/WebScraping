OBITUARY.
"Blessed are the dead toho die in the Lord."
Died, on the 25th October, at the residence of
* the Rev. Wesley E. Smith, Miss .Matilda A.
- Skaly, in her eighteenth year. Miss S. was bless
ed with the counsel* of a pious Methodist mother
from early life. Maternal counsels had a salutary
effect upon the life of the daughter. She early be
came the subject of grace, and a member of the
Church. Her life was blameless, and her walk
consistent to the day she was called hence to join
in the assembly of the church of the first born.
Nearly eighteen, and naturally of an amiable dis
posilion, she was passionately loved by her floating
parents ; admired and caressed by her relatives and
friends. But the object of their affection is gone.
Still, while we can but weep, it is not as those who
t) -f have no hope. For though taken just on entering
•> life, she rests in peaceful slumbers, rescued from
the cares which increase with growing years. A
-■ little before she was taken sick she manifested
very great concern for a brother who was then
■ick, talking to, and advising him to seek religion.
That brother recovered. Oh that lie may lake the
admonition.' During her own sickness she was !
calm and resigned ; she said she wished to live
long enough to me her paienis once more, who1
lived in Hoollier county. Tins desire, however,
she lived not to realize, they not arriving until al
ter her death. AmJ, now Unit she is gone, w here
fore should we weep ; the Lmd gave, and lie hath
taken away, and blessed be his name.

A TENDER CONSCIENCE.
The accommodating nature of the conscience,
and how willing it is to oblige its owner’s
inclinations, after some liule show of resistance is
well exhibited in an article with the above head
ing. We take a few extracts from it:_
Take care vou don’t resemble the monkey
with the meal-top. His master thrashed hitn
when he caught him at the theft, and showed
him his hands covered with meal, that he might
understand the reason of his punishment. Mon
key. after the next theft, took care to wash his
hands, and, when his master came to punish him
extended them to show how clean they were.
His master smiled, and immediately brought him
a looking-glass—his face and whiskers were
powdered with meal: and there you have the ori
gin of the adage, “You have washed your hands
but not your lace.” There will stl[l be a moni
tor, Eusebius, to hold the looking-glass to vou
and the like ol you : and look to your face - and'
whenever you find that you have put a good fad
upon any doubtful matter, take the trouble then to
look at your hands; and if they be clean, look
again and see if your face and hands arc clean 1
together. And that will be the best lableau-vi
vant you or any one else can study. Now, how
ever, that conscience seems so thoroughly’gone
to the dogs, without any personal allusion to
your case, Eusebius, I cannot resist telling you
an anecdote by which you will see how Neigh
bour Grace of M-n ingeniously touched the
conscience of Attorney B., who was supposed to
havenone—upon the matter of a dog-theft, and
how Attorney B. was a match for Neighbour
Grace:-i—“I»n» come to thee. Friend B.," said
Grace, “to,ask thee a question. Suppose my
dog should go into thy kitchen, and run off with
I a neck of mutton,dost thee think I ought to pay
thee for the neck of mutton ?” “Without doubt,”
nnd Lawyer B. “Then I’d thank theo to pay
me three and fourpence; for it was thy dog stole
my neck of mutton, and that’s the cost of it."
“Perfectly right,’’said Attorney B., coolly draw
ing out a bill and receipt. “So, Neighbour Grace,
you must pay me three and fourpthce, and that
settles the matter.” “How so 1” “Why, as you !
asked my opinion, my charge for that is six and
eightpence—deduct value of' neck of mutton,
three and fourpence, nnd just so much remains.”
And Lawyer B. got the best of it, and made him
pay, too. Now; thus it was to probe another’s
conscience, without know:ng the nature of the
beast you stir up; not considering that when con
science thus comes down, as it were, with “a
power of attorney,” it ispowerful indeed—“recal
citrat undique tutus.’’
The story of Piso is in point. He thought to
act the conscientious judge, when he condemned
the soldier to death who had returned from fo
rage without his companion, under the itnpres
ioti that he had killed him ; but os he is upon the
point of execution, the man supposed to have been
murdered returns, all the soldiery present rejoice,
and the executioner brings them both to the pre
s nee of Piso. And what did the conscientious
Piso? His conscience would not so let him put
bv justice ; so, with a surprising ingenuity ofthat
nice faculty in its delirium, he orders execution
upon all three—the firstsoldier, because he had
been coodemued—the second, who had lost his
way, because he was the cause of his companion’s
death—and the executioner, because he had dis
obeyed his orders. He had but to pretend to be
greatly grieved at his vagary, to have the act lau
ded as an instance of Roman virtue. I will cotne,
therefore, a little nearer our common homes.
You shall have a scene from domestic life, as I
had it the other day, from a lady with whom I
was conversing upon this subject, who tells me
it is n veritable fact, and took place some seventy
years back:—“It will want its true power,” said
my friend, “because that one solitary trait could
give yon no idea of the rich humour of the ladv,
ihe subject of this incident—her simplicity,
shrewdness, art, ignorance, quickness, mischief,
made lovely by exceeding beauty, and a most
amusing consciousness of it. Seventy years ago,
too, it happened—there are no such Indies in the
better ranks of society now. She lived at Mar
gate. It caine to pass that the topping upholster
er there got a new-shaped chest of druwets from
London—the very first* that had appeared in
Margate—and gavemadam, she being one of the
high top-families, the first sight of it. With the
article she fell in love, and entreated her husband
to buy it; but the sensible gentleman, having his
house capitally and fully furnished, would not.
The lady still longed, but had not money enough
to make the purchase—begged to have her quar
ter advanced. This was not granted. She pout
ed a liitlp, and then, like a wise woman, made up
her mind to be disappointed, and resumed her
more than wonted cheerfulness; but alas! she
was a daughter of Eve, as it will be seen. Christ
rnas-day came—itwusthe invariable custom of
the family to receive the sacrament. Before
church-time she sent for her husband. She had
a sin on her conscience—she must confess before
she could go> to the altar. Her husband was
surprised. “What is it?" “Yon must promise
not to be very angry.” “But what is it ? Have
you broken my grandmother’s china tea-pot ?"
•‘Oh ? worse than that." “Have you thrown a
banknote in the fire?” “Worse than that.”
“Have you run in debt to your abominable smug
gling lace-woman?" “Worse than that?" “Wo
man!” quoth he, sternly, and taking down an old
broad sword that hung over the chimney-piece,
confess, this instant;” and lie gave the weapon a
portentous flourish. “Oh 1 dear Richard, don’t
kill me, and I'll tell you at once. “Then I,
(sob.) I, (sob,) have cribbed (sob) out of the house
money every-week to buy that chest ol drawers,
and you've had bad dinners and suppers this
month for it ;nnd (sobbing) that’s all." He could
just keep his countenance to say—-“And where
have you hid this accursed thing ?” “Oh, Rich
ard I I have never been Hbletouseit; for I have
covered it over with a blanket ever since I had
it for fear of your seeing it. Oh I pray forgive
me!” You need not Le told how she went to
church with a “dean breast,” as the saying is.
It is au unadorned fact. Her husband used to
tell it every merry . Christmas to his old friend
guests. Here you have the story, Eusebius, as
1 had it thusdramnlically (for I could not mend
it) from the lips of the narrator. * * * *
You shall hear; ’tis but a simple anecdote af- j
ter all. 1 have learned it fiom a parish priest.
He was sent I or to attend the death-bed of a poor i
old village dame, or school-mistress. She had
a siri 10 confers ; she could not die in peace till
she had confsstd it. With broken speech, she
sobbed, and hesitated, and sobbed again. “I—1
1. she stammer'd out, nnd hid her lace again.
“There, I must, I must tell it; and may 1 be for
given! You know, sir, L have kept school
forty yeais—a poor sinful creature—I—1”-’’
“My good woman.” said the parish priest, “take
comfort; it will be pardoned ifyou are thus peni
tent. I hope itis not a very great sin.” “Oh
yes!” said she, “and pray call me not good wo
man. I am—not—good ;” sobbing, “alas, alas !
—there, I—will out with it I I put down that I
taught grammar—and (sobbing) I, 1, did not
know it myself." Eusebius, Eusebius, had you
been there, you would have embraced the old
| dame. The father of lies was not near her pil
| low. This little sin, she had put it foremost, and,
like the little figure before many nothings, she
had made a million of it; undone tvord, nay, one
thought, before confession was uttered, had breath
ed upon and obliterated the whole amount.
Where will you see so great truth 1 And this,
you will agree with me, was a case of Tender
Conscience.
LORD ROSSK’S TELESCOPE.
At a late meeting of the British association, |
Lord Rosso gave the following account of his
gigantic reflecting telescope.
“ He explained the difficulties with which he
had to contend in making his reflector. Jn the
first place, ordinary speculum-meta! is more
brittle than glass; and it is so greatly expanded
by the heat that it is with the utmost diffiulty a
large speculum can be cooled without splitting, j
In Lord Rosse’s first attempts, he made one hun-1
dred castings without being successful. This
difficulty is avoidtd in inferior instruments by
varying the proportions of tin and copper which
form the speculum-metal, also by the additon of
zinc ; but the brilliancy of the polish and the re
flective powers are thereby greatly diminished.
An attempt was next mude to cast a speculum of
baser compound, which would not be brittle, and
afterwards to plate the surface with the best
speculum-metal. This answered the purpose
tolerably well; but theumqual junctions of the
plated metal cansid diffraction of the light in
jurious to the distinctiveness of the image. It
then occurred to him, that as the splitting of
speculum-metal in cooling must be caused by
the irregular manner in which the different por
tions of the mass contracted in cooling, if that
process could be regulated so as to m:ike the
metal cool gradually on one side the difficulty
might be overcome. To effect this, the lower
part of the mould was made of iron, whilst the
sides were of sand ; by which means the heated
mass cooled below at a quicker rate than in any
other part, that being comparatively the only
cooling surface. By this means, speculum-metal
of the required size could be cast without split
ting; but there wns found to be a defect in the
metal arising from air-bubbles rising through the
metal. To overcome the new difficulty, the un
der surface of the mould was made of vertical
plates of iron placed closely together; and
through those lamina of iron the air escaped, in
stead of rising through the melted metal. The
proportions of which the speculum-metal con
sisted were 58.9 parts of tin and 126.4 of copper.
So many minutiee are required to be attended to,
that even the composition of the melting-pots
was found to be essential to the perfection of the
process. In the ordinary iron melting-pots there
are minute holes, through which some portions
of the tin of the speculum-metal flows when
melted, and deteriorates the alloy; these holes
are prevented from being formed by casting the
melting-pots in an inverted position, instead of
erect. In grinding the speculum, which weighs
three tons and three-quarters, midis six feet in
diameter, it was placed in a tank of water, in
which it was kept revolving; and the polishing
tool, moved with two eccentrics and worked by
steam-power, was applied on the top. The re
quired focus was obtained by observation, riot by
measurement. The speculum, when completed,
had a focus of fifty-three feet; and the telescope
was fitted on the Newtonian plan, the image be
ing refl'-cted to a hole in the side of the tube,
near the top, into which the spectator looks, in
stead of looking towards the object. The im
mense tube weighs six tons and a half, and the
joint and apparatus on which it rests weigh three
tons and a half. To support this great weight,
two high and massive walls have been built; and
movable galleries art fitted to them, to elevate
the spectator, and enable him to look through the
eye-glass at all elevations. It is filled as a tran
sit instrument, and has scarcely any other than
a vertical movement,as it is intended for making
observations when stars come to the meridian.
10 compensate in some degree lor tno want oi
a traversing motion, a reflection is used j by
which means any heavenly body may be seen
an hour before it comes to the meridian. In
supporting the tube, so as to render it manage
able by one man, large counterpose weights are
employed, which diminish, by resting on the
; ground as the tube is elevated. The actual
[ weight to be moved, therefore, does not exceed
three hundred weight,and one person can elevate
it with great ease. The lowest angle to which
the tube can be inclined is ten degrees, and it
may be raised to four or five degrees below the
the pole. It was the examination of the nebu
lous bodies in the heavens that he principally
[ hod in view when he commenced the construc
tion of the telescope, fifteen years ago. He ex
| hibited the drawing of a nebulous cluster exam
ined through the great telesope ; the stars com
I prising it appeared os large as stars of the first
magnitude, though the whole cluster .of them,
seen through a moderately-good telescope, ap
pears only as a white patch in the heavens, in
most of the nebulae are seen filaments of light
issuing from their sides; and Lord Rosse con
ceives, that when he brings his great telescope to
bear on these filaments, they wiil be found to be
composed of stars. In this manner he will bo
able to verify' the ideas of astronomers ; and not
limiting his discoveries to new satellites or planets,
he will make known the existence of suns and
of planetary systems, compared with which our
celestial system is but a speck in the universe.”
THE TEMPLES OP NUBIA.
In all ages of the world it seems to have been
the anxious desire of civilized man to perpetuate
his memory nfter death. But, perhaps, the most
remarkable ptoofs of this now extant are fur
nished by the temples of Nubia. Allen’s splen
didly embellished "Pictorial Tour in the Medi
terranean,” published last year, brings this sub
ject strikingly before us. When we look at his
vigorous representations of the gigantic orna
ments with which the tombs of antiquity were
provided, it fills us with astonishment. We know
not howto believe that which it is impossible to
doubt. Too extravagant would it seem in a tale
of romance, if a king or chief were represented
as bestowing so much time, labour, and expense
on a sepulchre. All ordinary reasoning would
forbid us to believe that the pomp or vanity of
any mortal, could carry him to the extravagant
length of incurring the expense of providing him
self with a body guard of lifeless giants to watch
for ever near his cold remains. We can hardly
imagine such a wish could be conceived, and if
it were it would seem most unlikely that a desire
s > preposterous, should be supported, and that,
thousands of years ago, by the energit s of others,
with the means of carrying it into ettect. Yet
this, strange to say, has been accomplished.
Marvellous as it seems, the fact is curtain—that
colossal statues, worked with a great knowledge
of art still exist. The southern temple of Eb
satnboul, discovered by Burckhardi, and uncov
ered by Belzoni, is an object of worthy curiosity
with all travellers. Mr. Allen, was ns anx
ious as any of his predecessors were to look upon
it. A brief extract from his lour will suffice to
give a correct idea of the sculpture in question,
and the reader will observe that we have spoken
only of the exterior. The apartments within
were decorated with corresponding care. When
in their neighborhood, though the day drew near
its close, Mr. Allen and his companion deter
mined to wade over the immense mounds of fine
sand, which opposed their approach, and in
which, at every step, they sunk knee deep. He
proceeds
“Gaining the entrance, we found ourselves be
tween statues, whose towering forms were of
such magnitude as at first to create an impres
sion of doubt as to their being the work of the li
ny hands of men; it looked incredible. Three
of the four figures that adorn the front of this
temple are complete ; the other on the left, near
the entrance has lost its head, and the upper part
of the body. Above the doorway, is sculptured
the hawk-headed Osiris, in high relief: he bears
a globe on his head, and is receiving offerings
from two females standing on each side. These
colossi measure—height, sixty-five feet; across
the shoulders, twenty-five feet four inches; shoul
der to elbow, fifteen feet six inches ; length of
ear, three feet six ii cites; length of beard, five
feet six inches ; length of fore-finger, three feet;
elbow to end of middle finger, fifteen feet.
“The entrance lends into a fine hull, fifty-seven
feet by fifty-two, the roof which is supported by
eight columns, adorned by as many Caryatides,
thirty feet high. Each figure stands erect, crown
ed with a lofty mitre, the top of which reached to
the ceiling. They are supposed to represent
Osiris. On their shoulders are graven the name
of Raineses the Great, who ascended the throne
of Egypt, b. c. 1355. The two first figures are
buried up to their middle by the sund that has run
into the temple. Beyond this hall are two other
chambers leading to the adytum, at the bottom
of which are four sitting statues, much mutilated
about the head, but otherwise in tolerable preser-;
vation. From theae four principal apartments
branch off many others, all ornamented with hie
roglyphics, but generally coarsely executed, ma
ny having been left unfinished ; some indeed are
only marked out in black. The walls in the
larger rooms exhibit Spirited representations of
battle-scenes executed, notwithstanding the soft
ness of the stone, with great expression. Many
of the prisoners are represented with leopard
skins, as if war had been waged, ngajnstsome
savage nqjjon of the interior."
THE FRIAR AND THE NIGHT WHISPER.
While Mr. Welch was a minister in one of the
French villages, one evening, a popish friar,tra
velling through the country, because he could
find no lodging in the whole village, addressed
himself to Mr. Welch’s house, begging the fa
vour of a lodging for that night. The servants
informed Mr. Welch, who readily consented;
but as he had supped, and family worship was
over, he did not see the friar, but retired to his
room. After the friar had supped, the servant
showed him to his chamber, between whfPh and
Mr. Welch’s there was but a thin deal partition.
After the friar’s first sleep, he was surprised with
hearing a constant whispering kind of noise, at
which he was exceedingly frightened.
The next morning, as he walked in the fields,
a countryman met him, and because of his habit,
sainted him. asking him “where he had lodged
that night?” The friar answered, “with the
Huguenot minister.” The countryittan asked
him what entertainment he met with. The friar
answered, “very bad; for,” said he,“I always
imagined there were devils haunting these min
ister’s houses, and I oin persuaded there was one
with me this night ; for I heard a continual whis
per all the night, which I believe was nothing
else but the minister and the devil conversing to
gether." The countryman told him he was
much mistaken, and that it was only the minister
at his night prayers. “O,” says the friar, “does
the minister pray any ?" “Yes,” said the coun
tryman “more than any man in France ; and if
you stay another night with him, you may be sa
tisfied." The friar teturned to Mr. Welch’s
house, and, feigning indisposition, begged anoth
er night’s lodging, which was granted him.
Alter a wnne, Mr. weicn came down, assem
bled the family, and, according to custom, first
sung a psalm, then read a portion of the Scrip
tures, which he briefly expounded, and then
prnyed in his usual fervent manner: to all which
the fiiar was an astonished witness. At dinner
the friar was very civilly entertained, Mr. Welch
thinking best to forbear all questions and disputes
for the present. In the evening Mr. Welch had
family worship, as in the morning, which occas
ioned still more wonder in the friar. After sup
per, they all retired, the friar longing to know
what the night-whisper was. He lay awake till
Mr. Welch’s usual time of night for rising to
pray; when hearing the same whispering noise,
he crept softly to Mr. Welch’s door, and there
heard not only thesound,but the words distinctly,
; and such communications between God and man
as he knew not had been in the world. Upon
I this the friar waited for Mr. Welch to come out
I of his chamber: when he told him, he had lived
| in darkness and ignorance till this time, but was
i now resolved to give himselfup entirely to Mr.
| Welch’s teaching, and declared himselfa Protes
i tant. Mr. Welch congratulated him upon his
i better understanding, and exceedingly encoura
! ged him; and it is said that he lived and died a
j true Protestant. “This account I had,” says his
biographer, “from a very pious minister, who
I was bred in Mr. Welch’s house in France."
A KAFFER’S SPEECH.
HELP OH THE WAGON.
In January last, there was a general mission
ary meeting at KafTerland, South Africa, at
which most of the speakers were con vert-d na
itivfs. When we remember the degraded and
| almost brutal condition of tbi3 race half a cen
tury ago, it is truly wonderful to contemplate
what ihe gospel has done for them. One of
them spoke as follows :
“We are here assembled, but not to smear
our bodies with red clay and grease, and to join
the heathen dances in what iss'nful and wicked.
We are here assembled, not to excite the sorcerer
to his guilty deeds of darkness, at the same time
trembling from head to foot lest hesbould pounce
upon us. No, but we have come together to
tlmnk God who has so loved the world, that he
gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever be
lieveth in him should not perish, but have ever
lasting life,—and he has called on us Kaflers, to
receive that word which declares the gift; and
to keep that gift in our hearts. Do we come to
thank God with our mouths only? No, we
have assemblid together to excite each other to
thank Him, by giving some of our substance to
assist that work which has taught us and our
children that we have immortal souls,—that there
is a world beyond the grave, to which we are
fast hastening ; and to know that we are sinners,
and to flee to the cross of Jesus for pardon and
for peace. You know as well as I do, that the
wagon cannot move without the oxen ; it would
never move,—it would stand still and rot where
it stood. The word of God is the wagon, and
money is the oxen to carry the wagon around'
the world. That word was brought to us from
the other side of the great waters, and it has re
mained with us until now. But what have we
done to assist the oxen ? Nothing: we must
excite each other to-day to love and good works,
and give our goods to sustain the oxen to carry
the wagon of the gospel to all who have ears
to hear it. Do not say, “ I have got no money,
therefore I cannot assist," Remember ye not
that goats are money, cows are money, oxen are
money, horses are money, the produce of our
fields is money. Any ol these things, or all
of these things, if w’e have a heart to do so, we
can give to assist the wagon to run, run, run, and
to keep it with us too. Look ye to-day, before
missionaries came to this land, we had no money
no clothes, no cottages, no books, no wheat, no
barley. We had no churches: we knew not
God, nor his word. Therefore, let us give to
assist the word. Before 1 sit down I tell you,
my friends, what 1 will give: I will give a
young ox, fit to be placed in the yoke to-mor
row.
DANGERS OF STEAMBOAT TRAVELLING
IN THE WEST.
An apparently candid English writer, and a
late traveller in this country, named Dr. Scores
by, has delivered a pleasant lecture in London
on the United States. He spoke very pleasantly
of us as a people, and with admiratiou of our
magnificent country. If his account of the
recklessness of the conductors of our Western
steamboats be correct,—it is no wonder we
h(tar of so many explosions. He says:—“But
the Ameiican stearneis in many casts were
worked even at a higher pressure than 80 to 90
lbs. The smaller bouts being calculated for the
higher pints of the rivers, which are subjected
to be very shallow in the dry season, are design
ed in every part fur lighuiess, so as not to have a
draught of more than from 12 to 18 inches.
Their engines were therefore runde as pact
and small ns possible, and were therefore workrd
not only upon a high pressure principle, but
upon a high pressure.' It was usual" m these
boats to have 120 lbs< pressure on the square
inch; and he had himself encountered a risk
still grenter than this. The boats being calcu
lated to carry cargoes as well as passengers, the
anxiety to get freight induced them to take in all
the goods presented to them, and in the core
deferred to, the vessel when he got into her was
loaded nearly to the depth of the gunwale:
The Mississippi was also at the time in a state o!
flUod, the water running at the rate of about six
miles,and in some cases eight inihsan hour,ata
height of twenty-five feet above its usual level
and this added to the increasing draught of the
vessel, required an increased pressure upon the
boiler before it could be got to- make head
against the rapidity of the current. At one
place they were no less than two hours without
making even the length of the vessel’s progress,
and the only resource io such a case therefore,
was to turn back (which no American would
ever do if it were possible to go forward) or to
increase the steam, and consequently the risk o(
weighting the valve. -
This they did until they eventually overcame
the resistance. Ou another occasion, when they
had started from a place called Chester, nboui
sixty or seventy niihs below St. Louis, the flood
was such that one whole town, containing om
thousand inhabitants, was under water, and the I
stream was so strong that the engine worked at!
as high a pressure he believed, as two hundred
pounds on the inch; and he had been told by
one captain that to get the steam up it was
sometimes the practice for the engineer to sit
down upon the valve. And these great risk:
were very little thought of in those waters, so
reckless are they of life. Calamity after calam
ity were continually happening from this cause,!
and yet no national remedy—nr. effectual meas-!
ure of a public nature—was taken to ensure
greater safely.” ^; * , «, * n

. AMPUTATION IN THE PRAIRIES.
A few days before the caravan bad reached
Walnut Creek, a Mr. Broadus, in attempting to
draw his rifle from a wagon, muzzle foremost,
discharged its contents into his arm. The bone
being dreadfully shattered, the unfortunate man
was advised to submit to an amputation at once;
otherwise, it being in the month of August, and
excessively warm, mortification would soon
ensue. But Broadus obstinately refused to con
sent to this course, till death began to stare him
in the face. By this time, however, the whole
arm hud become gangrened, some spots having
already appeared above the place where the
operation should have been performed. The
j invalid’s case was therefore considered perfectly
hopeless,and he was given up by all bis comrades,
w ho thought of little else than to consign him to
the grave. But being unwilling to resign him
self to the fate which appeared frowning ovi r
him. without a last tfTori, he obtained the consent |
oftwoorthiee of tne parly, who undeitook to
amputate his arm, merely to gratify the wishes I
| of the dying man, for in such a light they viewed J
uim. Their only ‘caseof instruments’ consisted j
of a handsaw, a butcher’s knife, and a large iron i
J bolt. The teeth of the saw being considered too j
coarse, they went to work and soon had a set ol i
| fine teeth filed on the back.. The knife having
been whetted keen, and the bolt laid upon the j
j fire, they commenced the operation ; ami in less
[ time than it takes to tell it, the arm was opened
j round to the bone, which wus al ost in an instant
sawed off) and with the whizzing hot iron the
w hole stump was so tfit dually seared as to close
the uiterits compleu-ly. Bandages were now
applied, and the whole company proceeded on
their journey as though nothing hud occurred.
The arm commenced healing rapidly, and in a
lew weeks the patient was sound and well, and
is perhaps still living, to bear witness to the
superiority of the‘hot iron’ over ligatures, in
■ taking up’ arteries.—Gregg's Commerce oj the

THE HOLY SEPULCHRE.
The view from the gallery of the building is
more exciting, nnjl on looking down upon the
moving mass of human beings beneath, my mind
was forcibly carried back to the scene which
the court of Solomon’s temple must have pre
sented when the different tribes and nations who,
from various parts of the world, came up to i
worship in Jerusalem, were assembled within
its sacred walls. I scarcely knew on what ob
ject to rest my r ye, so strange and varied was
the appearance and costume of the crowd assem
bled beneath. The diversity of language, the j
flaunting of the silken banners that slowly moved !
to and fro from the top of the Sepulchral dome,
the gaudy paintings of the Greeks, the waving
of censers, and the perfume of incense, the
crowds of devoted pilgrims, some in attitudes of
deep emotion, round each sacrt depot; thetur
baned Greek ; the high-capped Persian ; the i
shaggy coat of the Muscovite, or the Siberian ; !
the long beard and dark downcast visage of the
despised Copt; the rich dresses of the different
ecclesiastics; the mitred abbot, the vetieruble
patriarch, and the cord-giit friar, shall never
lade from my memory. But when to these I
add the scenes that took place upon some of the
succeeding days that are considered more im
poitant than sacred, when the devotees joined in
full chorus, though to speak correctly, it was
anything but chorus or harmony, the effect was
indescribable. Then when the organ of the La
tins was in full play, and the measured chant of
their hymns rose from the vanlts beneath ; with
the loud nasal twanging of the Greeks; the
drums and timbrels of the Armenians; the low
plaintive murmuring of the Copts; the groans
of the devout pilgrims, that issued forth from
Calvary ; the glimmering of the thousand lamps
and tapers; the long lines of the different pro
cessions; and the “ bustling busy hum” that at
intervals came from the court without, as some
of the pilgrims quaffed their sheibet, or cheap
ened beads and rosaries, formed a scene that beg
gars all description. But even at those moments
when the din and clamour of this scene, which
re embled the confusion of tongms nt Babel,
was loudest, there was one that, like a death-bell,
ever rung in my eats—a sound which, eighteen
Centuries before, every spot in the vicinity must
haveheaid; a sound at which tho very rocks
were rent, and the eaith did quake, which burst
asunder the narrow confines of the tomb, and
called into life the mouldering ashes of the
saint; a sound at which all nature, auimaie and
inanimate, was moved lo send fotih one univei
sal groan of anguish ; that sound » as the “ Eloi,
Eloi, Lama Sabacthani.”— Wilde's Narrative.

The Bible should be the first book used from

necessary to wail until the child is able to read
(or itself; t,he best mode of presenting instruction
is by familiar verbal communication; its truths
are better remembered, and in this manner too, a
large portion of the Bible can be condensed into 1
a small compass. Give the young mind subjects
for thought. They are ever active,"ever busy,
and if not provided with proper aliment by those
who have the care of them, they wilt resort to
something for themselves which may be adverse
in its influence. The precepts of the gospel are
ennobling and refining in a high degree, and
they will ere long show their (fleets Upon the

who have been brought up according to the wis

the young mind of one instructed in the gospel
precepts, how much more elevated in its charac
ter, how much more ready to sympathize with
suffering, and to respond to benevolent and noble
sentiments; it has partaken of the true and prop

DOMESTIC CONVERSATIONS BY J. D. M.
THE ROSS.
“Pray, look at this rose, mother, it so very
pretty,” said a curly-headed little- fellow who had
just come in from the garden.
It is, indei d, beautiful, my dear, and its sweet
scent delightful. Cun you tell the, George, who
gave the lose its rich color and pleasing per
fume?"
The little fellow looked up in his mother’s
face, and answered, “ God.”
“ Yes, George, God made all the flowers of
I ihe garden, and the trees of the orchard. Do
you know why he made them?"
“No, mother; pray tell me.” . 1
f To give us pleasure, my son.' If he had
not made those lovely flowers that adorn our
gardens, we could not nave the pleasure of ad
miring them, and if he bad not given us the
fruit trees that stock our orchards, we could not
enj >y their pleasant fruit. What return ought
we to make to God for all his goodness?”
*■ YVe ought to love him, mother."
“And if we love him, how shall we act?”
“ 'The Scriptures s.ry, If we love him we
shall keep his commandments.’”
“You lemember bow very kind aunt Har
riet was to you when she was here on a visit,
and how very fqnd you were of her; and you
remember how displeased you were when
Samuel Leggett spnke ill of her. Now, God
has done much more for you than your aunt
Harriet, or evtn your pari rits, and if you are
willing to obey our commands, that'is, to do as
we tell you, how much more willingly ought you
to obey God, who gave you life and friends, and
all the other blessings vou eniov.”
“How can 1 obey “God’s commandments,
mother ?”
“ First, by loving him more than any one
else; more than father or mother, biother or
aunt; more than any one or any thing in the
world. You must love God with all your
heart, because he made you, and wishes to
make you happy ; and if you thus love him and
perform alt his commandments, he will take
you to heaven, where you will be happy for
ever.”
“ How much I would like to go to heaven ;
it must be such a delightful place I” „
“ Yes, George, it is a more delightful place
than you or I have any ldto of; but as I have
told you the first thing that God. rtquires of us
l will tell you the Second, which is, that we love
our neighbour as ourselves, that we treat every
one as we would wish to be treated by them._
You know you refused to lend your kite to
Richard when he asked it of you yesterday,
though he wished ve.y much to have it, and you
had played with it a long time. That was not
doing to him as you would wish to be done
unto."
George felt ashamed, and said he was very
sorry he was so disobliging, arid that in future
he. would try to obey God’s commnuds.
“ If you try, dear George, there is no doubt
of your success, for God never gives us a com
mand that we ate unable to obey ; but you must
try with all your lieu it.”
“ I " ill) mother. But see my beautiful rose
that was so ftesh halt rut hour ago, is diooping
and fading, and will soon be quite spoiled.”
Yes, my son, the lov. I jest fiuwcis will lade,
and although those that are left in the garden
live longest, ytt in a little time they too will
wither and dir. And we, like the flowets. must
die ; you mid 1 shall rest in the silent dust; but
if we obey God’s commands, if we love and
serve him as we ought, we shall tlun be con
ducted by holy angels to a world where the
flowers uever fade, and where death never en
ters. Let us sing, V. ...
