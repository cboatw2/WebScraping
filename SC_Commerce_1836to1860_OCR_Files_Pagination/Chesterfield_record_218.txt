OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNI 1 ED
STATES, TRANSMITTED TO
BOTH HOUSES OF CONGRESS
December 4, 1933.
Fellow.atizrns of the Saute and
of the House of Representatives:
I congratulate jou on I lie favorable c.'rcinnslances
in the condition of our country;
under which you reassemble for the
perlormn,\co ofvour official duties. Though
the anticipatton o an abundant harvest !i ?ve
not every where been realized, yet, on the
whole, the labors of the husbandman are
rewarded with a bountiful return; industry
prospers it) its various channels of business

vails through our vast d.vvrsity of c.i.nate;
nothing threatens, from abroad, the continuance
of external peace; nor has any thing
at home impaired the strength of those fraternal
and domestic ties which construe
the only guaranty to the success an J per.,
mancncy of our happy Union, an i winch,
formed in the hour of per i, have hi h rto
been honorably sustained through every viciss'tudc
in our national afthirs. These
blessings, which evince the care an 1 beneSconce
of Providence, call (or our devout
fervnt gratitude.
We have ii'V i-ss re ison to bo gravfui

v IV .*i
The present year closes the first half
c mturv of our federal institutions; an 1 our
~\ll r\:hnr? iii
sysioni??uweriiig Hum
acknowledged, practical, and unlim.tod operation
which it lias for so long a period
given to the sovereignty of the People?
has now been fully tested by experience.
The Constitution devised by our fore
fathers as the frame work and bond of that
system, then untried, has become a settled
form of government; not only preserving
and protecting th* great principles upon
which it was founded, but wonderfully promoling
individual happiness and private interests.
Though subject to change and entire
revocation whenever deemed inadequate
to all these purposes, yet such is the
wisdom of its construction, and so stable
lias been the public sentiment, that it remains
unaltered, except in matters of detail comparativcly
unimportant. It has proved amply
sufficient for the various emergencies
incident to our condition as a nation. A
formidable foreign war; agitatingcollis'ons
between domestic and, in somo respects,
rivalsovnreignties; temptations to interfere
in the intns'ine commotions of neighboring
? O
counries; the dangerous influences that arise
iu periods of excessive prosperity; and the
anti-republican tendencies of associated
wealth?these, with other trials not less formidable,
have all been encountered, an i
tiius far successfully resisted.
It was reserved for the American Union
to test tho advantages of a Government en_
of the popular will, and our experience lias
.sttown ihat it is as bencficient in practice as
it is just in theory. Each successive change
made in our local institutions has contributed
to extend the right of suffrage, has increased
the direct influence of the mass of
the community, given greater freedom to
individual exertion, and restricted, more and
more,the powers of Government; yet the
intelligence, prudence, and patriotism of the
People have kept pace with this augmented
responsibility. In no country has education
been so wide!}' diffused. Domestic peace
has nowhere so largely reigned. The clo>e
bonds of social intercourse have in 110 instance
prevailed with such harmony over a
space so vast. All forms of religion have
itnifnrl fnr the first lime, to diffuse charitv
and pieiy, because, for the first time in the
hts'ory of nations, all have been totally untrammelled,
and absolutely fiee. The deep,
est recess of the wilderness have been pene
trated; yet, instead of the rudeness in the
social condition consequent upon such nd.
ventures elsewhere, numerous communities
have sprung up, already unrivalled in pros,
pcrity, general intell gence, internal tran.
quility, and the wisdom of their political ,n
siiiu'tons. Internal improvement, the frui
of individual enterprise, fostered by the pro
tection of the Suites, has add el new links tc
the confederation, and fresh rewards to pro
vidcot industry. Doubtful questions of do
mcstic policy have been quiedy scttl d b\
mutual forbearance; and ngricul.ure, com
merce, and manufactures, minister to eaci
other. Taxation and public debts, the bur
dens which bear so heavily upon all othei
countries, have pressed with comparative
lightness upon us. Without one entangling
alliance, our friendship is prized by ever}
nation; and the rights of our citizens are
every where respected, because they ari
known to be guarded bv a united, sensitive
~W C7 W
and watchful People.
To this practical operation of our insti.
tutions, so evident and successful, we ow<
that increased attachment to them which i:
among the tnost cheering exhibitions o
popular sentiment, and will prove their bes
security,in time to come, against foreign 01
domestic ussuuh.
'Phis review of the results of our institu.
i?on9, for half a cvn'ury, without exciting r
spirit of vain exultition, should serve tc
undress opon us die great principles
from which they have sprung; consan
and direct supervision by the People ovei
every public measure; strict forbearance
on the part of the Government from exer.
cising any doubtful or dispu.ed powers; am
a cautious dbstiuenco from all interferons
with concerns which properly belong, unci
are best left, to Stale regulations and indi.
vidual enterprise.
Full information of thes'afe of our fur
4,'i^n affairs having been recently, on differ
cm occasions, submitted to Congress. J
dewm it necessary now to bring to your no
iice only such events as have subsequently
accurrred, or are of sucrt importance us tc
require particular attention.
The most amicable dispositions continue
to be exhibited by all the nations *.vi'n whorr

foreign relations.
I am happy to he now able to inform you j
that an advance has been made towards the j
adjus nient ofour difficulties with that lie- j
j public, ami tr.e restoration of the customary j
j good feeling between the two na ions. This ]
! import ?nt change has been elected by
conciliatory negotiations,that have, resulted '
i in the conclusion of n treaty between the j
j two Governments, which, when ratified, will '
j refer to the nrbi'ramcn' of a friendly Pow- ,
j cr uii the subjects of con roversy between j
( us growing out of injuries to individuals.?
I Tucre is at pn's n', also, reason to believe I

| ?hry of the United Sta'os, no ofFioial cor- {
respondonce between this Government and |
that of Great Britain has passed since that!
communicated to Congress towards theI
close of their last session. The ofFer to j
negotiate a convention for the appointment j
of a joint commission of survey and explo-1
rat ion,* I am however, assure 1, will be met!

j wll be of a liberal character, and that this
; negotiation, if successful, will prov to tie an
| importan* step towards the satisfactory and
j final adjust men' of the con roversv.
I I had hoped that the respect f.ir the laws
j and regard for the peace and honor of l?oir
j o.vti country, which as ever characterized
, the citizens of the United States, would
I liave prevented any portion of tht-m from
I using anv m ans to prom^c insurrection
i in the 'crritory of a Power with which we
, arc at peace, and wbh which the United
| States are desirous of maintaining the most
! friendly relatmns, I regrtt deeply, howev!
or, to bo obliged to inform vou that this
has not been the case. Information has !
been g.ven to me, "erived from otFiciai and ;
other sources, that many citizens of the IJ.
j States have associated together to make
j hostile incursions from our territory mto
| Canada, and to aid and abet insurrection !
j ll ere, in violation of the obligations and
laws of the United Status, and in open disj
regard of their own duties as citizens- This
' information has been in parr confirmed, by
r a hostile invasion actually mr!e by cit zcus j
} of the United States, in conjunct i.)n with
f Canadians and others, and accompanied by
a forcible seizure of the property of our ci;
tizens, and an application thereof to the
. prosecution of military operations against i
j the authorities and people of Canada.
The results of these criminal assaults j
i upon the peace and order of a neighboring
>jf u.t.v t> iu vyu3 iu im; c.vpeciecl,
I fatally destructive to the misguided or de
ludcd persons engaged in them, and high- '
! ly injurious to those in whose behalf they j
are professed to have been undertaken.? '
,! The authorities in Canada, from intelli- '
j gence received of such intended movemeivs '
j among our citizens, have f 1; themselves ;
i obliged to take precautionary measures i
j against them; havec atmlly embodied the !
j militia, and assumed an attitude to repel;
the invasion to which they beii^ved the co!
lonies were exposed from the United States.
'! A state of feeling on botli sides of the fron11
tier has thus been produced which called

i lor prompt anu vigorous iiii' ii-tvuva:. h
j nn insurrection existed in Canad t, theamij
cable dispositions of the United S'.a'es to.
j wards Great Britain, as well as their duty to
1 themselves, would lead them to maintain a
strict neutrality, and to restrain their citi- j
z^ns from all violations of the laws \v: i:h j
have been passed for its enforcement. But j
5 this Government recognises a stiil higher j
| obligation to repress attempts on the part of j
j its citizens to disturb the peace of a country j
where order ptevnils, or has b<en re-es-j
- tablished. Depredations by our citizens ]
i upon nations ai peace with the United
j States, or combinations for committing
i them, have at all times been regarded by
} ( the American Government and People with
' the greatest abhorrence. Military incur
J s'or.8 by our citizens into countries so situ'
1 ated, and the commission of acts of violence
. on the members thereof, in order t "> effect
1 i a change in its government, or under any
-1 pretext whatever, have, from the com.
r, inencement of our Government, been held
}! equally criminal on the part of those en.
?; gnged in them, and as much desorving of
rj punishment as would be the disturbance of
?, the public peace by the perpetrate*- of simiJ.
lar acts within our own territory.

consequence, to the war which is waged ! ;

Cons itu 10a, is wisely left to Congress v
alone to dcei le. It is, by the laws, alrea-1 r
tiv mado criminal in our citizens to em- j c
barrass or anticipate that decision by tin-; t
authorized military operations on their part, j 1
Offences of this character, in addition to j r
tht ir criminali'y as violations of the laws c
of our country, have a direct tendency to >
draw down upon our own citizens at large ! a
the multiplied evils of a foreign war, and ! c
expose to injurious imputations the good i c

sue, is herewith communicated. I can., ; li
not bu: hope that tlie good sense and pat- j f<
rio'ism, the regird for the honor and re-| n
putation of their country, the respect for j it
the laws wlrch they have themselves en. k
acted for their own government, and the j y
Jove of order for which the mass of our j o
People have been so long and so jus ly A
distinguished, will deter the comparatively n
few who are engaged in thcr, from a, fur. ti
t ier pros-'cution of sucli desperate enter" r\
[irises. In the mean time, t ie existing 'aws l n

It will appear, from the correspondence
herewf.'n submitted, that the Government o
of Russia declines a renewal ol the fourih ?
of the convenion of April, 1824, fi
r-v /-? I II* V
oetween the United States ana 111s impc- n
rial Majesty, by tiie third article of which s
it is agreed that "hereof er there shall not a
b fjrmed by the citizens ol the U. States, or tl
under the authority of the said States, any os- ii
tablishmeut upon the northwest coast of A- a
mertca, nor in any of the islands adjacent, ?
to the north of 54 degrees 40 minuses t<
of north latitude; and that in the same man- g
ner there shall be none formed bv Russian c
subjects, or under the authori'y of Russia, J
scudi of the same parallel;" and by the ] o
fourth article, u that during a term of tne j u
>e?rs, conning from the ignature of the | c
f resent conveniion, the ships of both Pow- j t|
crs, or which belong to their ci.izens or sub- i c
jeets, respectively, may reciprocally fre_ j li
quei>\ without any hindrance whatever, the 1
inerior seas, gulfs, harbors, and creeks upon
the coast mentioned in the preceding s
article, for the purpose of fishing and tra- y
ding with the natives of the country." The ti
reasons assigned for declining to renew the b
provisions of this article are, briefly, that 1
ihe only use made by our citizens of the ti
privilege it secures to them has been to j y
supply the Indians with spirituous liquors ii
ammunition, and fire.arms; that this traffic tl
has been excluded from the Russian trade; c
and as the suppl os furnished from the Uni- c

tablishmcnts on the northwest coast, and : c
calculaed to produce complaints between j a
the two Governments, ilis Imperial Ma- i f
jesty thinks it for the interest of both coun. j r
tries not to accede to the proposition made I j
by the American Government for the re- \
n"wa! of the article last referred to. c
H te correspondence herewith communi- (
ca'cd will show the grounds upon which <
we contend that the ciiizens of the Un ted ?
States have, independent of the provisions i
of the convention of 1824, a right to trade j
with the na'ives upon the coast in question, i
at unoccupied places, liable, however, it is f
admitted, to be at any ttme extinguished by r
the creation of Russian establishments at i
such points. This rig t is denied by the j
Russian Government, which asserts that,
by the operation of the treaty of 1824, t
each party agreed to waive the general right (
to land on the vacant coasts on the rcspec- ; t
live sides of the degree of latitude referred <
to, and accepted, in lieu thereof, the mutual i
privileges mentioned in the fourth aiticle. r
The capital and tonnage employed by our (
| citizens in their trado with the northwest i
, coast of America will, perhaps, on advening I
: to the official statements of the commerce (
! and navigation of the United States for the [ r
i last few years, be deemed too inconsidera. J (
j ble in amount to attract much attention; 1 s
yet the subject may, in other respects, de- j s
, serve the careful consideration of Congress 11
| I regret to stale that the blockade of the j {
piincipai ports on the eastern coast of Mex- [ t
ico, which in consequence of differences j (
jbe \v;en that Republic and France, was ; i
j instituted in May last unfortunately still j s
| continues, enforced by a competent French J c
i naval force, and is necessarily embarrass- j i
j mg to our own trade in the gulf, in common j \
| * it'i that of other nations. Every dispo-; I
! shim, however, is believed to evist on ihe 11
| part of the French Government to render 11
l this measure as little onerous as practicable | i
j to the interests of the citizens of the United i
! S'a es, and to those of neutral commerce;
j and it is to be hoped that an enrly settle- (

, A convention for marking that part of t
j the boundary between the United States i
j and the Republic of Texas which extends j
j from the month of the Sabine to the Red I

{ city on the 25;h of April last. It lias since i
b; en ratified bv both Governments, and !
seasonable measures will bo taken to (tarry j <
it into effect on the part of the Uui.ed [ t

j The application of that Republic for a<L |

' n.ally withdrawn, as will appear fr?m the | I

An exposition of the fiscal affairs of the j ri
Jovcrnment, and of the r condition for the ; di
ast year, will be made ?o you by the Sec- ' ol
cfary of the Treasury. j in
The available balance in the Treasury, j p<
n the 1st of January next, is estimated at j is
>2,705,34*2. The receipts of the year, ; ti
rom customs and lands, will probably j di
mount to $20,615.51)8. These usual i si
ources of revenue have been increased by ! fc
n issue of Treasury notes, of which less j te
han eight millions of dollars, including J p<
fitvrest and principal, will he outstanding g;
t the end of the year, nnd by the sale of ti<
no of the bonds of the Bank of the UnL th
2d States, for $2,254,971. The aggre. w
;ate of means, from these and other sour- n<
es with the balance on hand on the 1st of p(

ian eight millions of Treasury notes, a
onstitutes an aggregate of about forty mil. tli
ons of dollars, and will s ill leave in the rr
Treasury the balance before stated. Sr
Nearly eight millions of dollars of Trea. St
ury notes are to be paid during the coming j
ear, in addition to the ordinary appropria. j Je
ions for the support of Government. For , a)
ioth these purposes the resources of the j nTreasury
will undoubtedly be sutlicient, if! a?
he charges upon it arc not increased be- j 0!

lowever, is likely to exist; nor can the , R1
he postponed instalment of the surplus rev. I a)
inuo be deposited with the States, nor any S:
:onsiderable appropriations beyond I e r(
istimales be made, without causing a deft- o
tiency in the Treasury. The great caution tl
idvisablo at all times, of limiting appropriations
to the wants of the public service, is p
enderod necessary at present by the pros- , d
aeci've and rapid reduction of the tariff; f<
vhile the vigilant jealously, evidently ex. c
ited among the People by the occurrences h
)f the last few years, assures us that they p
;xpect from their representatives, and will a
sustain th?m in the exercise of, the most g
igid economy. Much can be effected by ii

When we call to mind tho recent and o
JXtreme embarrassments produced by ex- 'i
ressive issues of bank paper, aggravated by tl
he unforeseen withdrawal of much foreign y
lapital, and tho inevitable derangement o
irising from the distribution of the surplus c
ovenun among the States, as required by ti
Congress, and consider ihe heavy expenses a
ncurred by the removal of Indian tribes a
>y the military operations in Florida, and n
)n account of the unusually large appropri. j]
ifions made at tho last two annual sessions n
if Congress for other objects, we have c
itriking evidence, in the present efficient tl
jtateofour finances, of the abundant re- s
sources of the country to fulfil all its obli- p
ja'ions. Nor is it less gratifying to find v
hat tho general business of the community S
Iceply affected as it has been, is reviving d
vith .additional vigor, chastened by the les- r
;ons of the past, and animated by the hopes s
if the future. By the curtailment of paper s

The contra*: between the suspension of
814 and that of 1837 is mos sinking. Tne
iiort dura ion of the latter, the prompt resjraiion
of busings, the evident benefi s renting
from an adherence by the Govern,
icnt to ihe constitutional standard of value,
istead ofsanctioning the suspension by the
icetpt of irredeemable paper, and the adimages
derived from the large amount of
>ecie introduce j into the ccuniry previous
1837, afford a valuable illustration ' f tne
uepofoy of the Government in such a
ts'/s; nor can the cowpaiison fiii to
miove the impression that a national

rot oulv were specie payments resumed

7e liave been saved the mortification of

c third timo seized on to fasten upon the
>untry so dangerous an institution; and we
lay also hope that the business of mdividu.
s will hereafter be relieved from the inju.
es effects of a continued agitation of that
isturbing subject. The limited influence
f a national bank in averting derangement
i iho exchanges of the country, or in comfiling

pparently exhibited, throughout, a fuithful
dministration of the affairs intrusted to his

iat he commenced abstracting the public

ontinued to do so, progressively increasie

ubstantially failed, in consequence of the
uspension of specie payments.

It seems proper, at all events, that, by any

should be made a felony, and visited with

officers themselves, to provide every guard
againct trangiessions of this character, that
is consistent with reason and humanity.
Congress cannot be too jealous of the conduct
of those who are entrusted with the
public mon y, and I shall at all times be
disposed to encourage a watchful discharge
of this duty. If a more direct co-operation
on the part of Congress, in the supervision
of the conduct of the officers entrusted with
tnc custody and application of tho public
money, is deemed desirable, it will give mo
pleasure to assist in the establishment of any
judicious and constitutional plan by which
that object may bo accomplished. You
will, in your wisdom, determine upon tho
propriety of adopting such a plan, and upon
tie measure necess ?ry to us effectual exe^.
cution. When ilie ia'e Bank of the United
S:ates was incorporated, and made th<? depository
of the public moneys, a right was
reserved to Congress to inspect, at its plea,
sure, by a commtlteeofthat body, the books
and the proceedings of ihe bank.
Tn one of the States whose banking institutions
are supposed to bo amongst the first
in point of stability, they ore subjected to
constant examination by commissioners uppointed
for that purpose, and much of the
success of its banking system is attributed
:o this watchful supervision. The 6ame
:ourse has also, in view of its beneficial
operation, been adopted by an adjoining
3 ate, favorably known for the care it has
always bestowed upon vvhateve" "elates to
its financial concerns. I submit to your
consideration whether a committee of CV>njress
might not bo profitably employed in
nspecting, at such intervals as might be
iceined proper, the affairs and accounts of
officers intrusted with the custody of the
>ublic moneys. The frequent performance
>f this duty might be made obligatory on
he committee in respect to those officers
vho i ave large sums in their possession,
?nd left discretionary in respect to others,

Joes appear to ma that, with a subjection
)f this class of public officers to the getter*
il supervision of the Executive, to exumimu
[ions by committee of Congress at periods
sf which thev should have no previous notice,
and to prosecu ion and punishment as
for f'lonv for every breach of trust, the
iife.keeping of the public moneys, under
the sysviu propo* d, might be placed on a
?urer foundation than it has ever occupied
since the establishment of the Government,
The Secretary of the Treasury will lay
b< fo e you additional information contain*
ing new details on this interesting subject.
To these I ask your early attention. That
it should iiave given rise to great diversity
of opinion cannot be a subject of surprise.
After the collection and custody of the pub.
lie moneys had been for so many years
connect d with, and made subsidiary to,
the advancement of private interests, a retui
n to the simple and s'df.denying ordinance
of the Constitution could noi but he difficult.
But time and free discussion eliciting the
sentiments of the People, and aided by that
concili itory spirit which has ever charac*
terized their course on great emergencies,
were relied upon for a satisfactory settlement
of the question. Already has thisanticipa.
tion, on one nnporanf point at least?tho
impropriety of diverting public money to
private purposes?been fully realized.
Thrrfl is no reason, to suDDOse that legisla.
tion upon that branch of the subject would
now be embarrassed by a difference of op,
inion, or fail to receive the cordial support
of a large majoriy of our constituents. The
connexion which formerly existed between
the Government and banks was in reality in ?
injurious to both, as well as to the general
interests of the community at large4 Itag.
gravated the disasters of trade, and the de.
ran jrements of commercial intercourse, and
administered ncwexcitement and addition*
al means to wild and reckless speculations,
the disappointments of which threw the
country into convulsions of panic, and all
but produced violence and bloodshed. The
imprudent expansion of bank credits, which
was the natural result of the command of
the revenues of the State, furnished the
resources for unbounded licesse in every
species of adventure, seduced industry from
its regular and salutary occupations by the
hope of abundance without labor, and de?
ranged the social state by temoting all
trades and professions into the vortex of
speculation on remote contingencies.
The same wide-spreading influence im?
peded also the resources of the Govern.,
ment, curtailed its useful operations, .embarrassed
the fulfilment of its obligatfens,
and seriously interfered with the execution
of the la ws. Large appropriations and op*
pressive taxes are the natural consequences
of such a connection, since they increase
the profits of those who ara allowed to use
the public funds, and make it their interest
that money shou'd be accumhlated and ex_
p nditures multiplied. It is thus that aeon*,
centrated money power is tempted to be.
come an actives agent in political affairs;
and al/ p*?st experience has shown on which
side that influence will bearrayed. Wede*
ceive outjefves if we suppose that it will
ever bo round asserting and supporting the
rghtsof the community at large, in opposition
the claims of the few.
fn a Government whose distinguishing
sharac:erlstic should be a diffusion and eq.
aiization of its benefits and b irdens, the advantage
of individuals will bo augumenled
at the expense of iho mass of the People.
Nor is it the nature of combinations,for the
acquision oflegislative influence, to confine
their interference to the single object for
which they were originally formed* The
temptation to extend it to other matters
is, on the contrary, not unfrcquently too
strong to be resis'e J. The influence, in
the direction of public affairs, of the community
at large, is, therefore, in no slight
danger cf being sensibly and injuriously affected
by giving to a comparatively small,
