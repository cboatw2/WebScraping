HOLSTON CONFERENCE.
We have nothing from the Holston Confer
ence but the report of the Committee on Separ
ation and the stations of the preachers, which
were handed us by Bishop Janes. We expect
to have further items and reports furnished by
the Secretary. Up to the time of our setting out
to conference, however, they had not arrived.
REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON SEPARATION.
The committee to whom was referred the sub
ject of church separation, and other matters con
nected therewith, would respectfully submit the
following report.
In common with our brethren all over our
widely extended Zion, our hearts are exceeding
ly pained at the prospect of disunion, growing
out of the action of the late General Conference
in the case of Bishop Andrew. Your committee
believe this action to be extra-judicial, and form
ing a highly dangerous precedent. The aspect
of affairs, at the close of the General Conference,
was indeed gloomy; and while we have sought
for light from every possible source, we cannot
believe that our church papers are the true ex
ponents of the views and feelings of the whole
South or of the whole North. We would re
spect the opinions of our brethren everywhere,
but we feel that we shall not be doing justice to
ourselves, the church, or the world, if we do not
express independently, and in the fear of God, our
own sentiments on this important subject. We
are not prepared to see the church of our love
and choice, which has been so signally blessed
of God, and cherished by the tears, prayers and
untiring efforts of our fathers, lacerated and torn
asunder without one more effort to bind up and
heal her bleeding wounds. Therefore,
Resolved, That we approve of the proposed
Convention to be holden at Louisville, Ky., May
1, 1845; and will elect delegates to said Conven
tion, according to the ratio agreed upon at the
last General Conference by the Southern dele
gates. ✓
Resolved, That the conferences m “the non
slaveholding states and territories be, and they
are hereby respectfully requested to elect one dele
gate from each Annual Conference, (either in
conference capacity, or by the presiding elders,)
to meet with one delegate from each of the slave
holding conferences, in the city of Louisville,
Ky., on the fit st day of May, 1845, to devise
some plan of compromise. And, in the event
that the non-slaveholding conferences, or any
number of them, which, with the slaveholding
conferences, shall make a respectable majority
of all the Annual Conferences, shall so elect
delegates,—then, and in that case, the delegates
which we will elect from this conference to the
Louisville Convention, shall appoint one of their
number on said committee of compromise. And
the Southern and South Western Conferences
are respectfully requested to agree to and act upon
this plan.
Resolved, That if nothing can be effected on
the foregoing plan, then the delegates from this
conference are instructed to propose to the Louis
ville Convention the following or some similar
plan, as the basis of connection between the two
General Conferences,—proposed in the case of
a separate organization:—The said General Con
ferences shall appoint an equal number of dele
gates, (say ten,) who shall meet together in the
interim of the General Conferences, to whom
shall be referred for adjustment all matters of
difference between the two General Conferences,
or those churches over which they exercise juris
diction, their decisions or propositions for adjust
ment to be referred for ultimate action to the
General Conferences before mentioned; and
when both General Conferences have confirmed
their decision it shall be final and binding on both
parties.
Resolved, That if both the foregoing proposi
tions should fail, then the delegates from this con
ference are instructed to support the plan of se
paration proposed by the late General Confer
ence. And in so doing we positively disavow
secession, but declare ourselves, by the act of the
General Conference, a co-ordinate branch of the
Methodist Episcopal Church. And in the event
of either the second or third proposition obtain
ing, the delegates from this conference are in
strutted not to favor any,—even the least,—alter
ation of our excellent Book of Discipline, ex
cept in so far as may be necessary to form a se
parate organization.
Resolued, That our delegates to the late Gen
eral Conference merit the warmest expression of
our thanks, for their prudent, yet firm course in
sustaining the interests of our beloved Methodism
in the South.
Resolved, That we warmly commend the truly
Christian and impartial course of our bishops at
the late General Conference, and we affection
ately invite all our superintendents to attend the
Convention to be holden at Louisville, Ky.
All which is respectfully submitted.

LECTURE ON THE JEWS.
Major Noah, the well-known Israelitish edi
tor, delivered a lecture on the present state and
prospects of the Jews, at the Tabernacle on
Monday evening last. The weather was disa
greeable, but a very respectable audience was
gathered, who listened with interest to the state
ments and appeals of the lecturer. His first ef
fort appeared to be to explain and palliate the re
jection and crucifixion of Jesus Christ; in doing
which he adopted substantially the language
and reasonings of the Unitarians. The pres
ent posture of affairs as favoring the return of
the Jews to their native land, was graphically
set forth, and it was alleged to be the universal
expectation of that body that a literal restoration
is to take place. Within the last twenty five
years, said Mr. Noah, great revolutions have
occurred in. the East, affecting, in a peculiar
manner, the future destiny of the followers of
Mahommed, and distinctly marking the gradual
advancement of Christian power. Turkey has
been deprived of Greece, after a fearful and san
guinary struggle, and the land of warriors and
sages had become sovereign and independent.
Egypt conquered and occupied Syria, and the
fierce Pacha had thrown off allegiance to the
Sultan. Menaced however by the superior pow
er of the Ottoman Porte, Mehemet Ali was com
pelled to submit to the commander of the Faith
ful, re-conveying Syria to Turkey, and was
content to accept the hereditary possession of
Egypt _
Russia has assailed the wandering hordes of
the Caucasus, England has had various contests
with the native princes of India, and has waged
war with China. The issue of these contests
in Asia has been marked with singular success,
and evidently indicates the progressive power of
the Christian governments in that interesting
quarter of the globe. France has carried its
victorious arms through the north of Africa.
Russia, with a steady glance and firm step, ap
proaches Turkey in Europe, and when her rail
luauj uit; i-uuijm uu iu ujc uiuuv ora, »ui |iuui
in her Cossacks from the Don and the Vistula,
and Constantinople will be occupied by the des
cendants of the Tartar Dynasty, and all Turkey
in Europe, united to Greece, will constitute ei
ther an independent empire, or be occupied by
Russia, who, with one arm on the Mediterra
nean, and the other on the North Sea, will
nearly embrace nil Europe. The counter-bal
j ance of this gigantic power will be a firm and
liberal union of Austria with all Italy and the
I Roman States down to the borders of Gaul—but
j the revolution will not end here. England must
'possess Egypt, as affording the only secure
route to her possessions in India through the
i Red Sea ; then Palestine, thus placed between
the Russian possessions and Egypt, reverts to its
legitimate proprietors, nnd for the safety of sur
rounding nations, a powerful, wealthy, indepen
dent and enterprising people, are placed there
by and with the consent of the Christian powers;
and with their aid and agency, the land of Israel
passes once more into the possession of the de
scendants of Abraham. The ports of the Medi
terranean will be again opened to the busy hum
of commerce, the fields will again bear the fruit
ful harvest, and the Christian and the Jew will,
together on Mount Zion, raise their voices in
praise of him, whose covenant with Abraham
was to endure for ever, and in whose seed all the
nations of the earth are to be blessed.
This is our destiny. Every attempt to colonize
the Jews in other countries has failed,—their eyes
have steadily rested on their beloved Jerusalem,
and they have said, “The time will come, the
promise will be fulfilled I”
The Jews are in a most favorable position to
re-possess themselves of the promised Land, and
organize a free and liberal government. In
Poland, Moldavia, Wallachia; on• the Rhine
and Danube, and wherever the illiberality of the
governments have not interposed obstacles they
are practical farmers. Agriculture was once
their only natural employment. The land is
now desolate, according to the prediction of the
prophets, but it is full of hope and promise. The
soil is rich, loamy, and everywhere indicates
fruitfulness, and the magnificent cedars of Leba
non show the strength of the soil on the highest
elevations. The climate is mild and salubrious,
and double crops in the low lands may be annu
ally anticipated. Everything is produced in the
greatest variety; wheat, barley,rye, oats and the
cotton plant in great abundance. The sugar
cane is cultivated with success; tobacco grows
plentifully on the mountains, indigo is produced
in abundance on the banks of the Jordan; olives
and olive oil are everywhere found, the mulberry
almost grows wild, obt of which the most beauti
ful silk is made; grapesofthe largest kind flour
ish everywhere; cochineal is produced in abun
dance on the coast, and can be most profitably
cultivated.—The coffee tree grows almost spon
taneously, and oranges, figs, dates, pomegranates,
peaches, plums, nectarines, pine-apples, and all
tropical fruits known to us, flourish everywhere
about Syria. The several ports in the Jiiediter
ranean which formerly carried on a most valuable
commerce, can be advantageously re-occupied.
Manufactures of wool, cotton and silk could fur
nish all the Levant and the Islands of the Medi
terranean with useful fabrics. In a circumfer
ence vvithin twenty days’ travel of the Holy City,
two millions of Jews reside. Ofthetwoand half
tribes which moved east of the transjoidanic
cities, Judah and Benjamin, and half Manassah, I
compute the number in every port of the world
as exceeding six millions. Of the missing nine
and a half tribes, part of which are in Turkey,
China, Hindostan, Persia, and on this continent,
it is impossible to ascertain their numerical force.
Many only retain the strict observance of the
Mosaic laws, rejecting the Talmud and Commen
taries; others in Syria, Egypt and Turkey, are
rigid observers of the ceremonies.—N. Y.

EFFICACY OF PRAYER.
Frequently have we read with pleasure and
edification the memoirs of the eminent Francke,
and with no part of them have wo been so much
impressed as with the account of his remarkable
answers to prayer, offered in seasons of great
embarrassment, while prosecuting his benevolent
plans in building up the Orphan House at Halle.
Francke was distinguished in an age and country
not remarkable for piety, by a confidence in God
which was child-like, and which led him to a
throne of grace as his only resort in every diffi
culty. He knew that God was able to help, and
hence his faith never wavered under circumstan
ces which would have sunk any one in despair,
whose trust in God was less simple and confiding.
He engaged in his noble project with little or no
countenance from others, and without any pecu
niary resources of his own. To others his scheme
appeared chimerical j by himself it was regarded
as one which the Lord would certainly bless
and prosper. With his whole heart he entered
upon it, and he feared not to leave the result with
God, who, he felt persuaded, could easily control
the hearts and purses of men. We subjoin a
brief account of some of his difficulties, and of the
way in which they were relieved, by the serious
perusal of which we hope such an impression
may be pioduced on the reader's mind, as will
prepare the way for the application which we
design to make of them. We copy from the
Sunday School Union’s “Memoirs of Francke.”
•‘About the month of April 1696, our funds
were almost exhausted, and I knew not whither
to look for the necessary supplies, for the next
week. This caused me the greater distress, as I
was not at that time accustomed to such trials.
But it pleased the Lord to send me assistance, and
at the very time when it was needed. He in
clined the heart of some person, who was, and is
yet unknown to me, to put into my hands, by
means of another individual, the sum of one
thousand dollars, for the support of the Orphan
House. The Lord be praised for his goodness,
and reward the giver a thousand fold, with spiri
tual blessings I At another time, when our
stores were exhausted, the steward came to me,
and represented, that it would be necessary soon
to procure a considerable amount of provisions.
We laid our case before the Lord. Soon an op
portunity offered of obtaining the necessary funds
for our purpose, from a friend who needed but to
know of our wants, to offer his aid. But we
were unwilling to be burdensome to him, as ho
had been already liberal in his donations, and
we wished to leave ourselves in the hands of
God, knowing that He was able, and he had
shown himself willing, to assist us. We there
fore commended oursolves anew to him in prayer,
and we had scarcely finished, when'there was a
knock at my door, and a well-known friend en
tered, bringing me a letter and fifty dollars in
gold, from a person in another place. This,
together with twenty dollars, which were receiv
ed soon after, completely supplied our wants, and
we were taught that God will often hear prayer,
almost before it is offered.
“ In the month of October K198, I sent a ,du|
cat to a poor and afflicted woman, in anothfli
place. I received, soon after, a letter from heS|
saying, that it had come to hand nt a time whet"
she greatly needed it; and praying God to re
turn to my poor children a ‘heap of ducats,’ for
it. Soon after, I received from a friend twenty
five ducats, from another two, and from two oth
ers forty-five. About this time too, Prince Paul
of Wurtemberg died, and left a large purse mar
ked, ‘for the Orphan House at Halle,’ which I
found to contain five hundred ducats in gold.
When I saw all this money on the table before
me, I could not hut think of the prayer of the
poor woman, and how literally it had been ful
filled. In February 1699, I was again in very
straitened circumstances, and must enumerate
that among my times of trial; I was almost
entirely without funds, although much was need’
ed, for the supply' of the daily wants of the
children, and other poor. In this state of diffi
culty, I comforted myself with the promise of the
Lord Jesus, ‘seek first the kingdom of God, and
his righteousness, and all these things shall be
added unto you, ‘and strove to bring myself to
an unwavering confidence in God. When I
had given out the last of our money, I prayed
to the Lord to look upon my necessities. As I
left my room to go into the College, to deliver
my usual lecture, I found a student waiting for
me below, who put into my hands the sum of
seventy dollars, which had been sent me from a
distance. Although our expenses were now so
great, that this money did not last but two or
three days, and I was unable to predict how I
should be able to meet them for the future, yet
by the good providence of the Lbrd, our difficul
ties were constantly relieved.”
Francke states, that in the midst of all these
trials and embarrassments, so precisely was the
supply suited to their wants, that in no instance
had the children been forced to go without their
meals ; and no one, except his immediate assis
tants, was acquainted with their difficulties.
This is not a little surprising, when we remem
ber that hundreds depended upon him ; and not
less so, the fact that his own tranquillity and
peace of mind were constantly retained.
“ Soon afterwards,” he continues, “ we were
in the greatest want, and the steward came to
me, asking for money to meet the expenses of
the week. I knew not what to reply to him;
for I was without funds, and had no expectation
of any supply. But I trusted in the Lord, and
determined to go to my closet, and spread my
. wants before him. As I was engaged, however,
in dictating to an amanuensis, I sat down until
this piece of work should be finished. When
it was ended, I arose to go to my closet, and
while on my way, a letter was put into my hands
from a merchant, informing me that he had re
ceived a check for a thousand dollars, to be paid
me for the Orphan House. How forcible did I
feel the meaning of that promise, (Isaiah lxv. 24,)
‘Before they call I will answer, and while they
are yet speaking, I will hear!’ I had now no
reason to ask for assistance, but went and praised
the Lord for his goodness. I was thus led more
and more, to place my trust upon God, and give
up all dependence upon man.”
“At anothrr time, in the same year, when I
was in similar circumstances, I walked abroad
and meditated upon the glory of nature,—the
heavens and the earth,—and my faith was there
by much strengthened. I said within myself,
‘ How happy is that man, who, though he is
poor, and can lean on nothing here below, can
trust in the living God, who made these heavens
and this earth, and thus be satisfied and joyful,
even though in adversity 1’ Athough I well
knew that for this very day, I had need of a con
siderable sum of money, yet my heart was even
joyful, for I was strong in faith in God. When
L caine into the house, the superintendent of the
' building was there, and desired some monev for
the payment of the labourers. 4 Has any mo
! ney been received V said he. I answered, ‘No;
but I have faith in God.’ Scarcely had I utter
| id these words, when some one was announced
! at the door; and on going to him, I found he had
[ brought me thirty dollars from some person,
! whom he would not name. I returned to the
j study, and asked the superintendent how much
money he needed. He replied, ‘ Thirty dollars.’
j: Here they are,’ said I. Wo were both strength
j ened in our faith, by this happy supply, since we
saw therein the hand of God, in giving us what
was necessary at the very time when it was need
i id.”
“ At another time of great need with us, I
| made particular use in my prayer to God, of
; the fourth petition in the Lord’s prayer, ‘ Give
I us this day our daily bread,’ and dwelt upon
i the words this day,—for we needed immediate
| aid. While I was yet praying, a friend to the
I Orphan House came to my door and brought
I me four hundred dollars. In the year 1700, I
; was sick for some weeks, and when I recovered,
and was able to go out for the first time, I pray
ed the Lord to bless my ‘ goings-out, and my
comings-in.’ This prayer he was pleased liter
ally to answer ; for as'l left the house, a most
comforting and encouraging letter was put into
mv hand, and at my return another, containing
a hundred dollars for the support of our children,
with the exhortation to continue the good work.
This letter was from a pious merchant, a hun
dred miles distant. The Lord remember his
kindness ! On one occasion, a pious and benev
(olent female was visiting our Orphan House,
| and discovered that we were much in want of
j many things, but though in the habit of doing
much for us, she could not now render any as
sistance. She, however, spoke of our situation
to another person, who replied to her, that she
was just about to give fifty dollars to the Orphan
House. Our friend saw the hand of God so
clearly therein, and was so grateful for the sup
ply of our wants, that she was moved even to
weeping.”
TI1E NILE AND THE RED SEA.
“ A voice crieth unto mo from Seir:
Watchman, what from the night 1
Watchman, tvhat from the night 1
The watchman replieth:
The morning cometh, and also the night.
If ye will inquire, inquire ye: come again.”
Isa. ill: li, 12. Lmcth's T'raits.
The new mode of communication to India, by
the way of Alexandria, the Nile, and the Red
Sea, avoiding thus the immense sweep round
Peninsular Africa, shortening the journey to In
dia by nearly a half, brings Cairo and London
almost intojuxta position with each other. Step
ping on board the steam-boat at London, on the
evening say of the 4th of October, on the 19th
of the same month you are at Alexandria,—sai
Kj^upthe Nile in your steamer, you soon reach
Bo,—find yourself at Suez on the 23d, and by
HR Oth of November you step on shore at Bom
Egypt has thus become a sort of stepping
st<& between London and India; and ifthe pre
sent arrangement should continue, and the inte
rests of Great Britain are so indentified with it as
to be a sufficient guarantee to this effect, Egypt,
which according to the language of prophesy,
has been for so many years “ the basest of the
kingdoms;” (Ezekiel,29: 15.) will soon begin
to feel the influence of Christianity,—silent per
haps at first and scarcely perceptible, but all
powerful and renovating in its character,—and a
better day will open upon its dark and desolate
condition. This home and asylum of the Patri
archs,—this favored spot whither—warned of
God in a dream—fled in the night-time, Joseph,
the young child, and his mother, having been
‘smitten by God,’ will in due time,‘be healed by
him.’ An altar to the Lord will be raised in the
| midst of the land,and a pillar at the border thereof
to the Lord, and it shall be for a sign and for a
witness unto the Lord of hosts in the land of
Egypt: for they shall cry unto the Lord because
of the oppressors, and he shall sendthem a Sa
vior, and a great one, and he shall deliver
them.(Isa. 19: 22.) j
Late arrivals bring us the cheering intelli-;
gence that a rail-road is forthwith to be construe-,
ted from the Nile to the Red-Sea. The line from j
Cairo to Suez, we are told, has been already sur- j
veyed; the distance is but 84 miles; and there
exists not least difficulty on the whole route.
To facilitate the communication between the Nile
and the Red Sea, along that very road which the
children of Israel journeyed when they came out
of Egypt, there are five inns or khans already es
tablished. A strange sight this to greet the eye
of the traveller along this lonely desert! The
lawless habits of the Bedouin give no interrup
tion to these new and important arrangements.
The mail-boxes, even, are sent across the desert
without a guard, and with the most perfect safety;
not a box or a letter having been missed since
the regular communication was established.
Anciently, it is well known, a canal, which
was used some four months in the year connected
the Nile and the Red Sea; and it has been in con
templation to re-open this canal,—or to speak
more porperlv, to form a new one, for there arc
few traces of the old canal visible. Marshal
Marmont had thought that the ground between !
Cairo and Suez was unsuitable for a rail-road ;
but this was a mistake. According to Mr. Gal
loway who has made the late survey, “ the
soil presents remarkable facilities for the cheap
construction of the road-bed, being composed of
gravel or pebbles. For the first ten miles, being
the valley of the Nile, the ascent is 570 feet
above the water of that river. The line of the
road is then very level; the summit, 54 miles j
ftom the Nile, is 900 feet above the Red sea.”
In connection with the above we may say a
word or two of the Ancient Canal which con
nected the Nile and the Red Sea. “ This Canal,”
says a writer in Blackwood, “has its origin,
as was the case with every other in Egypt, in
the formation of a canal for irrigation, caused by
; an increased demand for available land in conse
quence of the augmentation of the population.
It was, in its origin, one of the numerous canals
which spread the waters of the Nile for the irri
1 gation of the land of Egypt.”
The first part of it was constructed to irrigate
the valley of Seba Biar, a valley extending
about half way between the Mediterranean and
the Red sea, and which was the Goshen of the
Israelites. At the time that Joseph selected it
for his brethren, “ it consisted of a low level, lia
ble to partial inundation, and affording good pas
turage, though hardly suited to regular cultiva
tion. For this reason, and from its vicinity to
Syria, it was given by Joseph to the children of
Israel, who were a pastoral tribe.” During the
time of the Israelites the canal was not formed ;
but after their departure “the new occupants
would naturally commence the formation of a
canal for irrigating the land they had gained.”
This could easily be done as the greater part of
the valley of Seba Biar, or Goshen, was lower
than the level of the Nile at the height of the
inundation. A Canal of seven miles in length,
was therefore begun at Bubastes, on the eastern
branch of the river, which, when finished, ad
mitted the water into the valley, irrigating the
country to the distance of about forty-five miles
from Bubastes, and about forty from the Red
Sea. Besides this some 20,000 acres were
gained for agricultural purposes. The long pe
riod of prosperity which the Egyptians enjoyed
after the departure of the Israelites, the beneficial
results which would flow to commerce by a wa
ter communication between the Nile and the
Red Sea, could not fail to suggest itself to the
intelligent monarchs that ruled Egypt Aristo
tle, Strabo and Pliny tell us that Sesostris attemp
ted it; but finding that the waters of the Red
Sea were higher than those of the Nile, he desis
ted from the attempt. Aristotle not only refers
to Sesostris, but to an'earlier monarch, Sesonch is,
the Shishak of Scripture. For some reason or
other, not mentioned, Sesonchis, though deeply
impressed with the importance of the plan, was
diverted from the design. The great work was
however ultimately completed. Herodotus.—
Diodorus Siculus, and Strabo, shew this in the
most satisfactory manner. The following is the
account of Diodorus Siculus. “A canal has
been dug from the Pulusiac branch of the Nile,
to the gulf of Arabia and the Red Sea. It was
commenced by Nekos, son of Psammetichus,
and afterwards continued by Darius, king of the
Persians, who made some progress with the
work, but abandoned it when he learned that, if
the isthmus was dug through, all Egypt would
be inundated, as the level of the Red Sea is high
er than that of the soil of Egypt. At last Ptol
emy II. (Philadelphus) completed the underta
king ; having adapted an ingenious contrivance
to the ingress of the canal, which was opened
when a vessel was about to enter, and afterwards
closed. Experience proved the utility of this
invention. The waters which flow in this canal
are called the river of Ptolemy, the king who
executed this great work. The town of Arsinoe
is constructed at its mouth.”
under tne Koreans, in me reign 01 Trajan, le
Canal des Deux Mers, was in great request to
convey the granite and the porphyry in the
neighborhood of the Red Sea. Porphyry vases,
and immense granite columns were then all the
vogue in Rome, and no pains or expense were
spared to procure what was so much admired.*
In the reign of Justiman the canal began to be
neglected; but when Egypt passed into the
hands of the Saracens in the Caliphate of Omar
in the eighteenth year of the Hegira (A. D. 639)
it was cleared out in the whole extent, and re
mained so for 125 years, when owing to a revolt
in the city ot Medina, the Caliph Irak ordered
his lieutenant in Egypt to fill up the canal of
Zuolzon (as the Arabian writers termed it) “that
i it might not serve to transport provisions to
Egypt."
Thus closes the history of this ancient canal,
—“ this great monument of civilization.” But
a new era has commenced in that region. The
silence that has so long reigned over that busy
route is once more interrupted ; and in the auspi
cious change we fondly indulge the thought that
we see the first ruddy glimpse of the glorious
dav when there shall be again “a highway out
of' Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian shall j
come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into As-]
Syria, and the Egyptians shall serve with the
Assyrians. In that day shall Israel be the third i
with Egypt and with Assyria, even a blessing in j
the midst of the land. When the Lord of hosts j
shall bless, saying, Blessed be Egypt my peo- j
pie, and Assyria the work of my hands, and
Israel mine inheritance.”

tupplied the Romans in the time of Trajan, were die

THE WELL OF JACOB AND TOMB OF
JOSEPH.
On our descending this hill of blessing, (Deut.
si. 29,) and such, I trust, we experienced it to be
sn this interesting occasion, we went about a
mile further to see the well of Jacob, where our
Lord conversed with the woman of Samaria, and
ieclared the great truth, that “ salvation is of the
lews.” Of the fact that the “ well was deep,”
jnd that something was required wherewith to
Iraw up the water, we had evidence before we
:ameto it; for our guide was greatly disappoint
ed when, on repeated inquiry, whilst we rode
ilong towards the well, be found we were unpro
vided with a long rope, dec., and proposed to go
back to the town to fetch one; but, being pressed
for time, we gave up the point, and gratified our
selves by merely seeing its surface, whilst some
>f our party went into a pit, and convinced them
selves of its depth by throwing down a stone.
There is now, I believe, no water in it; and the
mouth of the well is kept closed by a large stone.
There was something so striking in this scene,
hat it brought us back to the time of our Saviour,
md we could fully realize all that is related in
lohn iv. Near it is the beautiful and fertile
slain ofMoreh, which at once reminds one of the
parcel of ground which Jacob gave to his son
foseph, whose tomb is also near, which we visited.
There are several Hebrewand Samaritan inscrip
ions on the same. The whole is kept very neat
md in good repair by the bounty of Jews who
visit this tomb of Joseph. On our return to our
mcampment, we found all ready for starting, and,
ifter two hours’ ride, we came to Sebaste, the
ancient Samaria, beautifully situated on the top
af a hill, where there is a fine ruin of an ancient
shurch, in which the Turks have a mosque.
The village is poor and insignificant, but the
situation very fine and commanding. I was
greatly interested in this trip, which I hope to
repeat, in order to make myself better acquainted
ivith it, as it is only two short days’ journey from
ferusalem. The situation of Nablous is very
striking, having the mountains of Gerizim and
Ebal one on each side.—Bishop Alexander.
RITUAL HOLINESS.
If holiness consisted in the most exact and
painful obervance of religious duties, or if it
were their necessary result, and consequence,
Saul of Tarsus must have been a holy man. A.
more precise ritualist, probably, never lived.
“ After the strictest sect of our religion,” be
says, “ I lived a Pharise“ I profited in the
Jews’ religon above many my equals in my
own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of
the traditions of my fathers.” Nor does it ap
pear that he indulged in any wilful sin. His
persecution of the church was, he conceived, a
religious duty: I really thought within my
self that I ought to do many things contrary to
the name of Jesus of Nazereth.” “ I did it ig
norantly, in unbelief.” According to the views
he entertained, be was at once consistent and
devout
And yet he was unholy,—an entire stranger
to the work of grace upon the soul. Having a
name to live, he was dead,—dead in trespasses
and sins. The condition of his heart was bad.
Malignant passions raged there uncontrolled.
He was fierce, heady, high-minded ; he was ar
rogant, cruel even to ferocity, and a man of blood.
Conversion changed all this ; and he became a
pattern to the church in all gentleness and meek
submission. The man who once “breathedout
threatenings and slaughter,” became one of the
most patient sufferers of an age of martyrs. Of
himself he could say, “being reviled, we bless;
being persecuted, we suffer it; being defamed,
we entreat.” Nor was it upon one only the
change was wrought; the whole fabric and tex
ture of his heart was changed; of which his
meekness was at once a proof and consequence.
He now cultivated inward purity. He struggled
against an evil thought or a carnal appetite, as
against a deadly foe. He not only received the
truth that Jesus was the Messiah but be proceed
ed to another step, distinct from this, and in fact
lying far beyond it,—he lived a life of faith on
the Son of God.-—Rev. J. B. Marsden’s Dis
courses on the Festivals.
THE POWER OP TRUTH.
The celebrated Gilbert West and Lord Lyttle
ton, both men of ackowledged talent, had receiv
ed the principles of infidelity from a superficial
view of the Scriptures. They agreed together
to expose what they termed the imposture of the
Bible, and Mr. West chose the Resurrection of
Christ, and Lord Lyttleton the Conversion of St
Paul, as the subjects of their criticism. Both
sat down to their respective tasks full of preju
dice, and a contempt for Christianity. But what
was the Tesult? They were both converted by
their endeavors to overthrow the truth of Scrip
ture. They came together, not as they expect
ed to exult over an imposture exposed to ridicule,
but to lament their former unbelief and to con
gratulate each other that they'had discovered the
truth of revelation. They published their in
quiries, which form two of the most valuable
treatises now existing in favour of the truth of
God’s word, one entitled “ Observations on the
Conversion of St. Paul," and the other, “ Obser
vations on the Resurrection of Christ."
LINGER1NGS OP CONSCIENCE.
I From Chalraer*’ Lectures on Romans.]
We know not a more deeply interesting walk
of observation, than that which is prosecuted by
modern missionaries, when they come into con
tact and communication with the men of a still
unbroken country,—when they make their lodg
ment on one of the remote and yet untravelled
wilds of Paganism,—when after the interval of
rour, thousand years from the dispersion of the
great family of mankind, they go to one of its
most widely diverging branches, and ascertain
what of conscience or what of religious light has
imong them survived the lapse of so many gen
erations,—when they thus, as it were, knock at
he door of nature Icitfor ages to itself, and try if
here yet be slumbering any sense or intelligence
which can at all respond to the message they
have brought along with them. Nor do we
