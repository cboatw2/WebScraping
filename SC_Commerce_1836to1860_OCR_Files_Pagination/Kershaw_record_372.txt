were both excellent and abundant, and at 1(J o'clock
the busy tlnong dispersed.

Miss Piieu's' scholars.
Steamer Cajioen.?We are happy to learn that

Arrival of the Great Western.?The Great
Western Steam Ship arrived at New York on Sunday
last, in sixteen days f.om Bristol. She brings
dates from Liverpool to the 1 lt!i nit. The cotton

CONGRESS.
The National Legishituib was still busily engaged,
at our last advices, with the discussion of the I'rcsi.
elcntial question. The House had before it, in Coir.,
mittce of the whole, the Civil and Diplomaticnl Apnronriltf'On
Bill, but ihp runinhnrs most sedtilonslv
avoided saying any tiling on that particular bill; all
other subjects seem to be legitimate matters for debate,
but the precise question before tho House.?
Since our last, the House Ins had one of the longest
sittings on record, tlurty.onc hours, but with all this
laborious attention, nothing?absolutely nothing?is
accomplished. Mr. Adams seems to be the only
eonscicncious man in the House; lie has a ten hour
speech ready " cut aud dried," but as lie does not de-'
sire to delay the passage of the appropriation bill,
ho will wait for the next question that may come up
?no matter what?if the speech be in character |
with those of any of the preceding members?it will j

suit or.3 question as well as another. Much curiosity
is manifested to see this speech?it promises to be
a rich treat, and from the character of the man,
public expectation will hardly be disappointed.
I mux Cotton.?It is stated in a Natchez paper,
that tho llritish government last year, appropriated
sixty thousand dollars, for the purpose of obtaining
the necessary inform-lion, machinery and operations,
for improving the cultivation of Cotton in British
India. An English agent, employed to carry the
measure into effect, has succeeded in procuring tho
services of eight ?.I:ssissi;jpians undone Louisianian, I
who are to proceed immediately to India, and each
one to take charge of a cotton plantation, which may
serve as models lor those of the natives. They arc j
to carry with them, Cotton gins, as well as plantation

EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT, >
Columbia, 2sth April, 1810. $
Throughout the civilized world, it is an
established usage, lor States to mourn for
the death of their benefactors.
I On assuming the high Executive functions
of South Carolina, to which the Lieut.
Coventor has been constitutionally called,
by the death of his lamented predecessor,
the late Patrick Norm:, there would be
a dereliction of his solemn duties, were
he to p.iss, unnoticed, this sorrowful event.
Of the late Oov. Mohu:, it may be t:ulv
said, "lie was first in the hearts af his
countrymen,"?his name hallowed by a
chastity of motive, that disarmed reproach,
and made powerless invective. Entering
llic councils of the State at an early period
of his life?for a scries of years a
Keprcser.lative and Senator front Albe-j
vtllc?lie has been successively called to
preside over each branch of the Legislature,
as Speaker of the House, and as
President of the Scralc: and, as a voluntary
requital, was lastly honored with the
first office of the State.
Of his eminent virtues as a man?his
mild and forbearing rule, as Chief Magistiale?looking
with deep respect, ti the
execution of the laws: and at the same
time, mingling Executive clemency, with
inu ji^iu scvt'iny ui mr iu???it ??iuucessary
to speak; orof the general fidelity
and self devotedness with which he discharged
all the duties of the el?valed and
sacred trust confided to hint: they are
gratefully appreciated by the intelligent
people he so long and efficiently served.
In obedience to the force of generul
smypathy, and as tribute due to the Com[mandcr-ili-Chicf,
the Magistrate, and the
man, the Major-Gencral* throughout the
Slate, will ruuse the order to be extended
to their scperate commands, requiring all
the Officers to wear the usual badge of
mourning on the left arm, for thirty days;
and that on the 16th of May, the Commandants
at the Citadel, in Charleston,

a gun to be fired at every half hour, be1
ginning at sun rise, and ending at sun set:
! And the Executive recommends, that on
the 17th .May, the Citizens of the Slate
i assemble in their respective Churches, to
| united in condolence for the loss which
! South Carolina has sustained.
By ord?r of the Governor.
BEAUFORT T. WATTS,
Acting Aid-de-Camp.
' Congressional.?We regret to learn that
the tlon. F. ^v. Pickkns, who returned
home from Washington, a short time since,
in onik*! to recrtiit his strength, continues
so indisposed, as to render liis return to
Congress this session uncertain; and that
he has written to the Speaker of the House,
advising the appointment of a Chairman
of the Committee of Foreign Relations,
in his place. Wc learn ulso that the'tryihg"
climate of out national capitol, had
rendered the lion. 11. B. Rhett seriously
ill, but we add, with pleasure, that he is
on the rer very, or perhaps, by litis time,
entirely recovered.?Courier.
Ciiincii Bugs.?Wn regret to state that
the ravages of this insect are already apparent
on our corn?in some low places
they have actually killed it?although last
year the bottoms seem to have been less
troubled with them than the ridges. A
farmer who resides within 15 miles of Columbia
informed us that last year from
forty-three acres he gathered one wagon
load and two cotton baskets of ears?on 12
other acres he made nothing at all.
Carolina Planter.
Destroying lvsccls by Camomile.?In
the Irish Gardener's Magazine, it i3 stated
not only that decoctions of the leaves of
the common camomile will destroy insects
but that nothing contributes so much to
the health of a garden as a number of ca
momile plants dispersed through it. No
green house or hut house should ever be
without camomile in a green or dried state;
eithpr the stalks or the flowers will answer.
It is a singular fact, that if a plant is droopping
and apparently dying, in nine cases
out of ten it will recover if you place a plant
of rain'imile near it.
