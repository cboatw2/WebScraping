LATEST FROM ENGLAND.
[BY THE STEAMER ACADIA.)
The English papers received by the A
cadia, does not contain so much talk of
war, as those which were received by the
Queen, but, they still appear to be dissa
tisfied with the McLeod proceedings, and
make hard threats, in case he should be
executed.
We extract the following items from the
New York and Charleston papers:
"The arrival of the packet ship Eng
land, on the 10th of March, and that of the
steam packet Columbia on the 16th, re
vived the alarm and angry excitement oc
casioned by the report of Mr. Pickens ear
lier in the month. The former carried
out the proceedings in Congress relative
to fortifications and other preparations for
war, and those of the Maine Legislature on
the subject of the boundary; among the
news by the latter was the letter of Angus
-M'Leod, denying his brother's presence at
the affair of the Caroline, which the rabid
journals of course laid hold of as disposing
ofthe whole question,taking M'Leod away
from the tribunals, and making it impera
tive on the Court and the Government to
order his immediate discharge. Queer
notions of law these journalists seem to
have.
But before the Acadia left England, two
new subjects of newspaper controversy
had sprung up, and were in the full tide
of discussion; these were the action of the
Canadian Gove rnment in relaion to the
Cat halic Seminary of St. Sulpice, and the
division among the Oxford divines respect
ing the famous "Tracts for the Times,"
which seems to threaten very serious con
sequences, not only to the University but
the Anglican Church itself.
" The rumor current when the British
Queen left England, concerning divers
ships and squadrons being ordered to the
United States, soems all to have died away.
Touching the ships named as being under
orders for immediate equipment, it is now
said that their destination is China. But,
per contra, the Hampshire Telegraph has
the following:
"We have this day learned that our Go
vernment, in order to prepare for any
emergency that may spring out of the case
of M'Leod, (and if the republic execute
him, we do not think that there is a man
in this United Kingdom but will demand
justice,) have directed six regiments to
hold themselves in readiness to embark for
North America-two of which are the 19th
and 8th regiments, now in Ireland. It is
also stated in private letters from the first
circles in Paris, that Lord Granville, on
the 27th uIt., offiially announced to M.
Guizot, that the English government would
find it necessary to send ten sail of the line
to the same quarter. Of course a fleet of
steamers will form part of such an expedi
tion.
The boy Jones," who had already
been twice detected prowling about the
apartments of the Queen, in Buckingham
Palace. was a third time found there on the
16th of March.
The case of M'Leod.-We chronicle as
a remarkable circumstance, the fact that
ndon has taken a reasona
ble and common sense view of the M Leod
esse-perceiving that it has come properly
and in order before the judicial iribunals,
anti must there he disposed of in the fiest
place , while its disposition there. otte way
or the other, interposes no obstacle to such
final action as may be consonant with na
tioual justice. national equity and national
honor. The Londotn Spectatorsays:
" Every thin; seems to conspire to ag
gravate ill feeling and to neutralize better
dispositions. What is Lord Palmerstont
doing? Rumor says that he has sent out
peremptory demands for M'Leod's dis
charge, and orders for ships of the line to
back those demands on the American coast.
To what cnd has that been done ? on what
ground ? in what fashion ? Has Lord Pal
merston consulted the law officers of the
Crown, and made quite sure that the Uni
ted States can be called upon to give up
Mr. M'Leod, before, he has made his ap
pearance before the tribunals, on a charge
which, being formally, however ground
lessly made, 'must be legally disposed of?
Has Lord Paltmerston chosen the proper
time and mode of urging the demand to
secure success ? The most reasonabile de
mand may be so put as to make it impos
sible to accede: the country would be glad
to know how Lord Palmerston had man
aged."
We give another extsact, of a different
character, hut perhaps equally remarkable,
from the Dublin Pilot, understood to be
Mr. O'Connell's pa per:
"War-Engand vs. Ireland.
"The time approaches when England
must be humiliated or just, and Ireland
may he free. * * England may declare
war, but who will war for England ? Ire
land? What! pay taxes, and shed our
blood! And for what? *** Why should
Ireland war against France ? There is no
Irigh feeling to be gratified, no Irish inter
est to be promoted, by such a war. What
has Ireland done to France, or France to
Ireland, that we should shed each others
blood ? * France invades Ireland
well, where in her complicated embarrass
ments will England find troops to defend
Ireland, and preserve her province? Will
* Ireland defend herself, or leave the battle
t6 the belligerents, and make no choice be
tween tnasters? It is plain that England
does not calctulate on Irish co-operation.
*** A war against America is a war
against friends. WVere England never our
- tryrant, nor Ireland her slave, we would
war with reluctance; but as it is-no 4ve
cannot war with America; our hearts for
bid it-our hands would be powerless. We
cannot swell tho ranks of sutch a battle
aid for what? For love of England !"
We copy the following from the Nat ion
al Intelligen cer of the 9th inst.
OFFICIAL.
We are atuthorized to say that, under
the pressure of the public btusiness, increas
ed hvy recent events, as well as by the ap
arnchi of an extra session of Congress, the
Presidlent finds it indispensable to make
an arran;:ement for the employment of his
time. He proposes. thterefore. hd see his

From te Camden Journal.
Fhe Court of Common Pleas and Gene
ral Sessions closed its Spring Term ro
Lancaster District, on Saturday the 10(l
inst., the Hon. Judge Butler presiding. A
this term, the most important cas.e was th
State against John Sweat, for the murde
of Thomas Pickett. Sweat was convicte
of murder, and sentenced to be hung on th
2d of July next.
The offence was committed on the 141
ultimo, at Hill Island, on the Catawba ri
ver, in Lancaster District. In our notic
of the event, a few days after it occurrec
we attributed it to intemperance, and w
since learn, that on the trial, it appeare
that nearly every individual present on th
occasion, including the murderer and hi
victim, were more or less, uudet the influ
ence of drink. flow powerfully do sue
instances ef crime appeal to the friendsc
Temperance, to redouble, instead of, as w
fear is too much the case, relaxing thel
effort in a cause, than which, there is non
more deserving, for its advancement, th
most persevering exertionsof the Christia
and the Patriot.
John Sweat, we understand, is abot
thirty years of age, and has a wife and on
child.
If you cannot avoid a quarrel with
blackguard, let your lawyer manage it ra
ther than yourself. No man sweeps hi
own chitnuey, but employs a chimney
sweeper, who has no objection to dirt;
work, because it is his trade.
During the recent inundations in the ri
ver Rhone, there were seen on the bank
orsand in the middle of the water, numet
ous wild bulls, horses, foxes, polecats, ral
bits, rats, and other animals usually hostil
to each other, congregated together, with
out doing each other any harm, and amon
them was a great number of snakes.
A Confession.-A young convert in th
country recently got up and was making
confession somewhat after this sort, viz
"I have been very wicked, indeed I have
I have cheated many persons, very many
but I will restore four fold ;" when he wa
interrupted by an old lady thus:-" Well
should think before you confess much. you*
better marry Nancy Stebbins, as you agree,

Yes! there is no donhlt of it. They ha

battles of her country in the everglades<

he is past the age of his vigor and his mat

It is really shameftl, that a man posse!

Gaines has not yet lost, should be found
miserable and penurious as not only to er
gage himself in such pitiful business, bt
to allow his u-ife regardless of the finer feel
ings of her sex, ever to lecture before
public audience for 25 cents per hteat
Shame! Shame! should be the motto o1

ABBEVILLE
Mineral Springs.
Tf RIS ESTABLISHMENT is now in
Sepmnplete order for the reception of visit
ors, and is extensively provided with every ac
commodation and comfort which persons in
search of health or recreation, can desire. Mr.
and MIs. Lawhow, who are charged vith its
superintendance, are eminently qualified to
give uatisfaction, and the Directors ca'ii prom
ie that-as good a table and as clean and com
modious rooms will be furnishedl, as are to be
lad iiany watering place in the Uniied States.
These Springs are situated in a healthy and ro
manti region in the North Western corner of
Abbiille District, near the Anderson line, and
the place is as perfectly exempted from autum
nal fevers as any place in onr Mountains. The
waters are confidently believed to be equal to
any-in the United States, in all cases of chronic
diseas' or the liver and other glands, and of
chronic inflammation in any part of the system
-in ases of dispepsia and sick head ache they
have Vieen singularly eflicacious, having invari
ably given relief whenever adeqntely tried.
In these cases they may be almost considered
a specic, as well as in diqenases ofthe skin and
urinaryorgans. A Hack will be regularly run
during tbe season from Abbeville C. I., which
is 24 .i les distant, to carry passengers coming
to that place in the Stage.
BY TIlE DIRECTORS.
I hereby certify from personal observation,
that the water of the Abbevifle Mineral Springs
is singularly serviceable in all cases of chronic
inflammation and glandular obstructions. It
does not appear to possess any highly stitnnla
ting or-direct tonic properties, but imparts tone
to the whole system indirectly by its wonderful
effect ii wearing out inflammation, and in cor
recting the secretions of all the glands of the bo
dy. Afew Summers ago, I sent a patient to
the Sprimigs labouring under chronic gatretis,
which I found very difficit to treat to advant
age, and to my surprise the case was speedily
cured by the use of the water alone. Subse
quently to the above case. I sent another pa
tient to the Springs who was reduced very low
by uterine obstruction and chronic inflamma
tion, witli a pulse up to about 120 beats in the
minuite; she was soon entirely restored to
healtt by a light diet and the use of the water
ivitliout any Medicine whatever.
