Whig party died?it' dead, indeed, tt be.
)T This is the averment of Mr. Curbing.?
The Whig party?Mr. Clay and his
friends, that is?tins been killed stonedead,
by Mr. Tyler and Mr. Webster;
and now, if the other party (the opposition)
1 * -?I ?...t ili.r oilmm.
uia nm corne 111 ami Mippwii
istrntion, they too should feel the effects of
1 he same hostility manifested towards
their measures. This is the only reason
able interpretation that could, possibly,
be ??ivcn to the speech of .Mr. Gushing.
And then Mr. M. adverted to comments
that had been made, by members of the
House, and by the press, upon his own
speech, lately delivered on that floor.?
The Madisonian had accused him of sleeping
too long over Mr. Webster's speeches,
fie took occasion to say that ho would
pledge his political reputation that every
speech of Mr. Webster published before
this administration came into power, con
taincd avowals of principles entirely antagonisticul
to those embodied in the E\
chequer plan, which now had the support
of that distinguished man.
Mr. Gushing here rose and s;iid he could
read a speech of Mr. Webster's which
would confute the assertion.
Mr. Marshall said he would sustain that
assertion by more than one citation. Time
was when Mr. W. did r.ot make speeches
to suit occasions. And then he went into
an examination of Mr. Webster's formerly
declared opinions as to a financial measure
for the government and the country.
in support of the position which he had
first laid down. He quoted from speeches
of his in that House and in the other
to show that the principle now advocated
hy him, of giving the su!e<> the power to
yield or withhold their absent to a hank,
or other agent, created by the general
government, was utterly opposed to what
lie himself had laid down in many a speech
s?n this very question, and contended that
if that principle were correct, there was
nothing in the nullification of South Caro
1 ina to call forth the eloquent and immortal
speech on Foote's resolution. It was
u virtual abolition, even as Mr. W. had
<?iice and often described it, of the confederation.
Applied to the tarilF, or any
other measure sf the general government,

lead ! T<? the entire nullification
l>V states of national hws. And tills to
come, at (his late dav. from Daniel Webster!
Aud for what? 8 oca use Henry
Cinv chooses to oppose this administration
!
Mr. Marshall said he could not agree
with his colleague, Mr. Davis, in denying
the possession of g<?!?< of a very high
order to Mr. Webster. He knew that
that great man was represented as cold,
and awkward in manner and address.
It might i)e so, hut if so, it was the stern
and lofty coldness of Mount Ulane among
the mountains; and he had heard bi n
called, hy his opponents, in derision, 4,the
<Jodhkc." Upon this last hint Mr. Maishall,
(alluding again to the memorable
day wUcn it was first his good fortune to
behold a display of' Mr. Webster's |K)wers
when he was replying to Mr. Hayne on
Foot's resolution.) soared into a flight of
burning and impassioned eloquence w hicli
lias no paralel in my recollection, excepting
among the proudest efforts of tiie
great object of his eulogy. I could not. if
1 would, have taken down that language;
my pen foil from my hand, and 1 could hut
i'slen, with all that crowded auditory,
breathless and rapt, it was, indeed, a
magnificent panegyric.
Having reached its climav, Mr. Mar.
shall paused, folded his arms, and said?
| 4,And, Mr. Speaker, it is this man, now,
who"
When toe hour elapsed, and Mr. Proflit
took the fl??or.
Cries of 44 Hear him!" (meaning Mr.
M.) resounded from all parts of the house.
Mr. Proflit said that he was responsible
for this debate, which had reached too
great an extent, and ho must put a stop
to it- He would withdraw the motion to
reconsider.
Mr Thnrnnsore his rnllontiio. wishing
" J * " ' o ' o
to reply to .Mr. Cushing,) asked hiin lorenew
the motion.
The Speaker said it was now too late.
Mr. Marshall then gave notice that
upon another question tie hoped hereafter

MR. SNYDER AND MR. CIDDINGS.
These two gentleman have unluckily been
thrown together at one of the double desk son the :
i
floor of the House of Representatives; and Mr.
Snyder, [the son of the patriot Governor Snyder, !
of Pennsylvania,] remembering Mr. Giddings's
petition to divide the Union, lus particul. riy enforced
the doctrine upon Mr. Giddings, by having j
a plank put up between them on the desk. Mr.!
Snyder, in this silent way, has spoken almost as \
emphatic eloquence in the House of Rpresenta- :
tives as Cicero did in the Roman Senate, when
demanding the expulsion of Catulinc lie said : "Let
there be a wall between tts and the wicked."

between him and the honest representative of the :
Keystone of the Union, into a practical joke, and
labelled his side of the board with these two lines
of Tope:
41 Great wit with madness sure is near allied,
And thin partitions do their l>ounds divide."
Mr. Snyder, seeing the part o( the wit assigned
him by the madman who sat Inrside him, humored
the conceit, by placarding his side of the board j
thus:
This line's tiic act of mutual concession ; *
This the white side?the other Abolition.
"White is the emblem of our living God ;
Black was Cain marked, when driven forth to
Nod.
* There seems to be a double entendre in the i
word concession which, from flic spelling, allows
that it is a derivative from the Latin con and sedro,
meaning sifting together. It is not, therefore the
concession which comes from mutual consent,
which is here meant; but rather a sitting together,
without mutual ejuumt At i-.u t it ee::n. Mr.

CHERAW GAZETTE.
Ciieraw, Tuesday, January 31, 1943.
WAYf I:D,
At this olfiec, as apprentices, two active lads of
! good character, from 14 to 16 3 cars of age, and
, able to read.
i An Inquiry into the nature and benefits of
an Agricultural Survey of tiie State ok
South Carolina, uy John Bachman.
We have received from the Hon. I). E. IIuuf.r
a pamphlet of 4'2 pages, with the above title, and
have seldom read a production of the kind with so
much pleasure. It was read before a Literary
! Club which meets weekly in Charleston, as part
' of the exercises of an evening, and published by
! request of the club. The subject of Agriculture
| has evidently engaged much of the writer's attention
; nor was it the attention of a listless observer,
but of an acute, discriminating, philosophic and
deeply interested mind. The essay would be valuable
at any time, but is particularly so now,
when an agricultural survey of the State is about
to be commenced, and so large a proportion of our
planters understand so little of what such a surv<y
ought to he expected to accomplish in the present
state of our agriculture. Every intelligent planter
and farmer ought to procure the essay and read
it. It is published by Miller & Browne, Charleston.
Medical News and Library.?This is the tij
tic of a new periodical of which the first number
' * * * T ? #_ I>.
has hern issucu oy .ucssrs. xjea ol ulanchakd, or
Philadelphia ; to be published monthly at the very
low price of one dollar per annum, or six copies
for five dollars, ft is to contain, in addition to
miscellaneous medical intelligence, reports of clinical
lectures, accounts of the different picdical
schools and hospitals with notices of cases and operations
in these institutions, &c. etc. It will also
comprise "A Student's Library" consisting of
'ecturcs on different branches of medical science,
so printed and paged that it may be separated
from the other part of the periodical, and bound to
itself. There will also be apjiended to each num.
her of the " Medical News" a list of valuable
medical works issued from the press by the pubUshers,
with a brief notice of many of them ; which
will not be the least valuable part of the jicriodicul
to the country practitioner who wishes to keep
pace with the improvements in his profession.
There is another feature of the work which is
not the least valuable or the least called for, and
which the reader will learn from the following extract
taken f.om the Prospectus:
' The numerous medical delusi ms of the day,
and the devices resorted to by charl itans to delude
: the public, will receive due attention and be fully
exposed. Quackery never assumed a more aui
daucious front, or appeared in more guises than at
! present; and with the aid of the powerful uuxilia|
ries it has enlisted, seems likely to overshadow the
J whole country, unless proper efforts are made to
arrest it, and medical men arc furnished with the
means of refuting the numerous falsehoods and ab...
surdities daily propagated, and which obtain eredcncc
mainly because the truth in regard to them
i is never known."
We have received the " Philadelphia .Medical
| Advertiser for 1813; published by Pleasants &,
'.Maris, and distributed gratuitously to the Physi!
cians of the United States." It is lobe issued
! yearly. The No. before us consists chiefly of a
1 catalogue of the articles which they keep on hand,
which is, in fact, a catalogue of the approved arj
ticlcsof the materia uicdica. The publishers say
I their next number will not contain this catalogue,
but instead of it, some account of the new rune
dies which have been introduced into practice, and
| other interesting matter.
We quote with pleasure the following sentence
| from the preface to the Medical Advertiser:
44 We particularly call attention to the fart that
' we do not prepare any Compound Fluid Extract
?Concentrated Compound Syrup?Tonic Extract
?Tonic Mixture?or any other quack preparation
with a secret recipe."
Intelligent druggists understand almost as well
i as educated physicians the gross frauds practiced
upon the ignorant and credulous portion of the
| public by lying nostrum-mongers. It is, therefore,
i not a little surprising that so many men of respectability
and good mora! character among them should ;
knowingly countenance these frauds, and partake
i in them, too, by dealing in the articles. The only !
charitable excuse which can be offered for theni i
is that they have been insensibly carried along by
the influence of example, without consideration. '
An honest conscicncious man cannot deliberately
do, for mere gain, what he knows to be wrong.
It is gratifying to sec even one house of extensive
business, have the courage and the principle
to face public prejudice and sacrifice interest, when
true honc6ty requires it. Messrs. Pleasaxts &
Marvis deserve, and we trust will receive, the 1
. . . i
the patronage of respectable physicians in all purls
of the country. Without a personal acquaintance
with them, we venture to say, that they will not <
adulterate their drugs, nor send inferior or spurious
articles to those who order such as are good and
genuine from their establishment.
The Legislature of Vermont have passed a series ;
of resolutions relating to slavery, declaring among j
other things, that Congress ought to abolish slavery
in the District of Columbia, and prohibit the slave
trade between the States; and that the Constitu
tion ought to be so amended as to prolubit slavery i
in any of the States.
Provisions in Cincinnati.?We have before us
a Cincinnati paper of the lbth instant, from 44 the
prices current" in which we quote ns follows:?
Flour, bbl. 2 62 a 52 75, Corn, 16 a 20; Baron, j
2J a 3, Hains, 3 a 1$, Sides, 2 a 3; Pork, bbl.
3 75 a 5 75.
The Baltimore Patriot publishes an extract i
from 44 a private letter" from Washington City, i
which states that a 44 sharp correspondence" is re- :
{ ortcd to have passed between General Cass and
.Mr. Webster, since the return home of the latter,
in relation to the quintuple treaty and the provi- j
siou of the Washington treaty in reference to the i
maiutainancc of a squadron on the coast of Afri
ca. It is also stated that in the course of the cor- i
respondcncc Gen. Cass used gross personalities to- 1
wards Mr. Webster. The General, though an
able man, doubtless found the Secretary too hard ,
lor him, and as often happens with warm d:*.
putuu'.- -ha'v'l by delUi', a.-orled to the petty !
and vulvar revenge of hard names and personal
I abuse.
! As evidence of the deliberation with which in
' this conntry men consider the purposes for which ;
they sign [wtitions, it was stated in the newspapers !
a few weeks since, that a gentleman in one of the i
i northern cities undertook to procure 500 signatures
! to a petition for hanging a respectable clergyman i
of irreproachable chars ctcr, and actually succeeded
in obtaining his number in the course of a few j
hours?Another instance of recent occurrence ;
shows the facility with which signatures may be j
obtained to papers by those who take pains to do j
i so. To a recent call for a political meeting in j
' Philadelphia 1200 names were affixed, but when !
| the meeting was held only abou! 300 were pre- !
sent.

A lute convention of Democrats in Pcnnsylva. '
nia has nominated Mr Buchanan for the Presi-j
dency, and recommended him to the National
Democratic Convention, which is to be held some
time and somewhere not yet fixed upon, to in.
struct the people of the United States on the sub.
j ject of choosing a man to rule over them.
We sec the name of Judge McLean also men- !
j tioned in the papers as a candidate for the Presidency.
Samuel. Sands, Esq., Editor of the American
Farmer, Baltimore, advertises for sale the follow.

Louisiana.?The votes cast at the last election
I in Louisiana for and against the proposition toliold
a convention for the purpose of revising the State
j Constitution were counted by the Legislature on
the 4tli instant, when it was found that the People
| had determined in favor of a Convention by a vote .
| of 14,396 for, and 4,030 against it.
There begins to be some skirmishing between
the friends of Mr. Calhoun and those of .Mr. Vax
Bhrkn as candidates for the Presidency. The
talents and character of Mr. Calhoun arc diily
gaining him fri< nds; but the inunage.inrnt < f .Mr. ,
Van Burcn and the active exertions of his former j
I dependents who hope to be restored to office in i
| ease of his clcctio i, arc evit'e itly doing much for i
i him. Mr. Van Burcn's fr c ids seem confident,)
and Mr. Calhoun's friends evidently fear that the !
: former will l>c the nominee of tiic proposed Demo- i
j cratic convention.
As to the Whigs, at the South and West they ;
! almost uni versa'!y prefer Mr. Cav; but Gen. j
' Scott has inany friends at the North. If neither :
I J
of them can secure the cordial support of the part)',
Judge McLean may possibly still be taken up. j
! Such at least, is said to be the talk in Washing- j
1 ton.
The Hon. Thomas D. Sumter, J. G. Bow. '
max. Esq., and Woodward, Esq. of Fair- )
field arc candidates for Congress in the Columbia
district.
Ax American Slaver ox tiif. Coast oe Afri.
' oa.?The Govcrsnor of Liberia has sent a com- j
' munication to the American C-oIonization Society,
stating that a schooner belonging to New York
j api?curcd at Bassa Cove in June last, and soon
afterwards left the coast with 230 slaves on board. :
The su|?crcargo was a Spaniard.
The naval Court of Inquiry into the occurrences
<m hoard the U. S. brig Somers closed their ex- j ,
animation on the 19th instant, after a session of j
nineteen or twenty days. The next day they for- I
warded the result to the Secretary of the Navy, j
who will probably soon make it public.
.Mr. S. W. Wmitk so favorably known to the I
public as the Editor of the Southern Literary j
Messenger, of Richmond, Va., died on the 20th j
instant.
It is rumored that the Cabinet of the President
have determined ujwn an extra session of Ccn
gross. i
- I
The New York papers state that although the , '
report of the Court of Inquiry in relation to the \ ,
execution of Spencer and others onboard the brig j
.Seiners, is believed to be favorable to the officers I
of the brig, they still requested a naval court mar. j
tial for the investigation of the aff.?ir, which has j
bee* ordered by the Secretary of the Navy.
The rumour that Commodore Jones was super. '
scded in the command o< the squadron in the i '
Pacific turns out to lie untrue.
t
CONGRESS. j
In the Senate the debate on the bill for the oc- i
cupation of Oregon Territory still continues. A 1
bill has been reported from the Post Office Com- I ^
mittec making slight changes in the rates of post- ! 1
age, to accommodate them to the denominations i
of Federal money. A bill has also been reported !
from the Navy Committee providing for one ad- I
miral, two vice admirals and three rear admirals, !
witii salaries of $5,2J0, $3,600 and $2,600, re- |
speciivcly, when in service.
In the House a brief debate of some asperity j
occuried on a report from the Committee on Com- | _
mercc adverse to the laws of some of the states 1
which require colored seamen coming into the j
ports of these states to be imprisoned during the | (
stay of the vessel in port. The report lies on the !
table. A memorial which had been referred to the j
committee was the occasion of thcrfjiort. Another I
subject is also before the llouso which has given j 1
rise to a debate on slavery. It is a proposition to j
make coni|K;nsation forproj>ctty destroyed in Flori- i
da during the Indian War. Messrs. Giddings I
and Adams both op|>os/:d the appropriation to coin- 1
pensate for slaves, on the ground that they arc not *
property. The bill to remit Gen. Jackson's fine S
is still sometimes the subject of debate. The Ex- c
chequer ] ! it; is a be now under dn.cu- -ion. on ' !;c i
report of Mr. Fillmore adverse to its adoption.? '
The bill to repeal the Bankrupt law which passed
it* second reading by a large majority sonic tiinn
ago,;* still on the table of the House, and is some* i
time* taken up, and made the occasion of one or |
two speeches on general party politics.
[COMMI'NICATION.J
Mr. Editor,?Through the columns of your j
pajier I would wish to call the attention of the '
Intendant and Council, to the wretched condition '
of the Wells and Purnps on Front Street. Their | 1
truly deplorable state evinces very great negligence
on the part of those whose duty it is to keep Ihctn
in efficient order. It is impossible that we can , |
have clean, pood water, as long as they arc suf. 11
ft-rcd to remain with the flooring of the Wells rot- <
ring and falling into the water. <
I think a mite of the Tax rnonoy might be judi. 1
ciously applied, in new flooring the Wells, putting j
the Pump in proper trim and erecting a substantial j
railing around the Floors, which will prevent cat- (I
tic from getting upm them. I

THE ACADEMY BllLDIJKrsT
THE Cheraw Academical Society is now in
debt about $1600. Since its establishment it
has expended, for lots, huildings, and rcpaifr,
about $o(XX); besides large sums of money in
making up to toncbero from time to lime dc
ficiencic* in their salaries, aiding from inado.
qua'c receipts for tuition. Though tho
rfo^iety has heretofore received considerable
aid from citizens and others not members ; yet
the principal burden and the whole responsi.
bility (previous to last year) has always rested
on those who w-ere. Tho Society now
consists of few in number ; and at a meeting
convened this day, it was resolved to sell the
Academical Lots and Buildings for the purpose
of paying the above debt'; unless some
measures aro promptly adopted by the community
to discbarge the same. Most, perhaps
all, the members of the Society are understood
to be willing to co-opcraic with their fellow
citizens in this matter; but they are not disposed
to do it without their assistance.
The 16th day of poxt month is fixed for
dcterming upoqthe sale ; unless, before that
date, the people (with such arguments as satisfy
creditors) put their veto upon it.
By order of tho Academical Soriefv,
