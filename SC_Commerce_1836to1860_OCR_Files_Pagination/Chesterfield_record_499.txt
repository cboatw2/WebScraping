number. It is opposed to the sub-treasury

We learn from the National Intelligencer
that some strictures have appeared
in the New York Commercial Advertiser,
on the medical treatment of the late
lamented President in his last illness.?
The Intelligencer intimates that a report
of the case will be furnished for one of
the Medical Journals* and suggests that
discussions in regard to it, if they are to
take place, ought to l?e defered till that
report appears; and ought, then, to be
conducted through the Medical Journals.
The official report to the Secritary of
State bv the medical attendants furnishes
ground for comment. But it
should be borne in mind that it was
drawn up in haste, as the language plainh
flhewfl* and under a state of feeling by
rw fljcan9 favourable to a studied aocu^
rv.nf phrase, as well as for a purpose
which ft*fade much fullness of detail.
Circai a3L?ance ought therefore to he
made far any errors in the mu^gomont
?f the ease which a critical examiiJ,ti?n
of this report may seem to detect.
We have not seen the article in the
Commercial Advertiser, and know nothingof
its contents. An impression made
upon our mind bv reading the official
report was that the death of the President
was caused by inflamation of the
boweJ-s which had been too much overlooked
and neglected by the medical attendants
in their great solicitude for the
lungs, where, for some time, was the seat
the most alarming morbid action. But
this impression may have been erroneous.
We had not the data on which to form a
conculsive opinion. A report of the case
fnr thfi r)rttffx.finn mav vary materially
J?. r, v
the aspect which it presents to the eye of
a physician in a hasty report made under
unfavorablecircumstanceonly for popular |
use. Justice, as well as professional
courtesy to the respectable gentlemen
who were in attendance, requires that if I
discussions unfavorable to them are to
take place, they be defered till the full report
he published; or, at least, till reasonable
time be allowed for its appearance.

For the Farmers' Gazette.
Mr. Editor A neighbor of mine
. was induced by an article headed "Burn
your Cotton Stalks," which has been
published in several, papers, to make an
examination of his cotton stalks, which
has resulted in his conviction that the
suggestion of "A young Planter," is worthy
the consideration of his brethren of
the plough. This gentleman states to me
that a' number of his cotton stalks perished
last summer, in different stages of their
progress to maturity,?some of them with
a partial crop of bowls upon them. In
making the inspection alluded to, he discovered
that some of the limbs were perunderneath,
near their junction
luiaiMi
with the main stem. In some of these
cavities, he found a small straw colored
bug of an oblong form, between the size
of a grain of wheat and a small pea,
while from others the little intruder had
disappeared. I here inquired of him if it
was not probable that these intruders had
commenced their exploring expeditions
after the Stalks were killed by frost, to
which he replied, that ho noticed several
pjMertures ?liich were partially closed by
the after growtfy pf ttye plants. From
these facts, he id persuaded that much
evil for the present season might hnvc been 1
averted by a timely destruction of his cot- ^
(ton stalks. s
If any light can be shed upon this sub- ^
ject it is desirable that it be reflected i
through your columns. The subjects of <
ro* an 1 rust, after all the speculations 1
that have appeared in reference to their *
origin, still remain among the "terra in- <
cognita" of Agricultural ken. The best <
method of averting them, if possible, is a [
subject of great interest to the planter.
CORN STALKS.
To the Editor of Farmers' Gazette :
Sir:?As this is an unfavourable day J
for attending to out door business, I will J
I *
make a few remarks on the cultivation of:
Lucerne, a notice of which, I saw in a 1
I' r
l agree wan you runy in me optnion \ *
that we can cultivate it with profit. I j *
i purchased last winter in Columbia a small
parcel of seed to make an experiment. I ^
sowed them about the first of this month 1 y
in drills 20 inches apart, which Arthur j p
? ...? . i ? i ,i I '
Young thmks is more than double me'r
width necessary, he says nine inches is j t
the proper space between the rows. His
reasons appear to he plausible and, I will j
give them. He says if kept clean (in ! 2
wide rows) the plant licks up the dirt; J
which makes them unwholsome for stock,' a
that they fall down and cannot be so well
mown. But with nine inch spaces, one
; row becomes a prop for the other, and they j1
i do not get dirty and are easily cut with a c
I cradle. Young prefers the nine inch 1
drills to broadcast, as being more proj
duetive, and more easily and effectually t
| cultivated. Previously to sowing I pul- ^
| versed and manured the ground thor- j
j oughly, though not sufficiently decom- t
I posed for lht> particular purpose. About j f
the 1st of May is 4M time for planting;?
Lucerne at the North; whetherJhe fall is '
a better season for us (as you suggested) ^
remains to he tested. I canjo* hut j j
dis 'gree wiih you though; I must believe? j*
that the latter nart of February or 1st of;
March, is the proper time. A cold wet J
winter might he more injurious than a hot! e
dry summer. ,
Lucerne is indigenous to southern latitudes
and grows there to the greatest ^
perfection. It has been found in Italy s
and the south of France for many centu- v
ries, and in Persia and the vicinity of Lima.
In Peru it grows with great luxuriance ,
[ and is mown all the year round. South j r
: 3 iuth Carolina lies within the parallels o1 I
latitude that comprehend Persia, which s
are 26 to 39 degrees and a much more f
arid country. j
The city of Lima is still more so, being t
12 degrees south of the Equator, I should I
think this ought *o establish the fact that; *
1
our climate at le nst is not too hot for the ,
!s
i successful cultivationofLuccrne, and, too.' ,
i '
our pine lands have just the kind of soil i r
it delights ill?dry friable and sandy, all I
that is necessary is to make them rich
j enough. Arthur Young in his Anna's of < 'j
Agricu'fttrc recommends trenching as n
; best, and I am inclined to the same opin-1 c
ion, as the Lucerne strikes a very deep | ^
root, and besides, it would be much the ^
more durable way of manuring.
In conclusion, I have not a doubt but
I wo can successfully cultivate it, and make ! ,
j * I
it highly profitable as feed for either hor-J j
ses or cattle, to he fed in the manner that r
is usually termed sailing.
Milch Cows are said to be peculiarly
fond of it, more so than clover, and that fl
it imparts a high flavor to Milk and Butter, i
Upon an acre four Cows might be kept
in good condition, as it would aflbrd in a j
favourable season six mowings. g
I trust you will persevere in your expe- c
rimcnts as I shall do, and let your Agricultural
readers in due time know the result. ?
Sincerely, A Planter, j (
Marlborough April 20, 1841. a
[Our little patch of Lucerne is now be- *
ginning to blossom. No one, after seeing ^
it, can doubt that the grass is adapted to
this climate, and very highly productive. ! r
An inspection of it is enough to satisfy t
any person that 20 inches is too great a s
j space between the rows?9 to 12 is space '
j enough. The spears stand erect where
the bunches are close, hut lie nearly flat I
where they have room.

, Carolina if Congress should establish s
! another National Bank. t
A National Bank?-Nullification . 1
I Some people have very large eyes?and v
I believe other people to have very large
j ears. No body has ever proposed or im.
| agined the possibility that the -State would
I or could nullify the Charter of a National ?
j Bank. But the State might, and not im. *
I prohahlv would do the things following: c
1. First declare in the most solemn v
I form that such Chartei is a violation of
I the Constitution, and as such ought to be I
repealed. ^
2. Enact that no branch of such un- *
constitutional corporation shall be cstab- ^
ishcd in South Carolina, to impoverish
ler citizens and turn us into a colony of
;ome Northern city.
2. Enact that no bank chartered by
his State shall receive or pay out the
iotes of such Bank?under the penalty
>f having their own paper refused i:? all
>ayments to the Treasury. We do not
ipprehend, however, that there will he
my difference of opinion between the
State and the Banks on that point. South
Carolina will regulate and protect her
>wn local currency, beyond a doubt, leavng
peaceably to the Federal Clovernment
ts proper power to "coin money and reguate
the valu e thereof and of foreign coins."
If a National Bank is chartered, its
Charter will be repealed, and in that too,
South Carolina will doubtless take part
nost cheerfully.

Curious Anticipation. i
In the works of Roger B tc<?n, who wrote
in the 13 h century, rnav he found an antioi- j (
pation of tlie invention of the steamboat, loco .
motive engine on railroads, the diving-bell, , 1
the suspension-bridge, and, it might almost be j1
said, of the recent events at St Jean d'Acfe. i
His own words are these:?'Men may con-1 ,
struct for the wants of navigation such ma- |
chines that the greatest, vessel*, directed by a
single man, 6hall cut through the rivers and
seas with more rapidity than if they were propolled
by rowers: chariots may he constructed I
which, without horses, shall run with immeasura
de speed. A'en may conceive machines
which could bear the diver, without danger, !
to the depth of the waters. Men could invent i
a multitude of other engines and useful in- <
! slrumcnts, such as bridges that shall span the
. broadest rivms wi'hmit any interm-'diate sup,
port. Art has its thunders more horrible than '
j those or heaven. A small quantity of matter '
produces a horrible explosion, accompanied I
by a bright light; arid this may be repeated so <
as to destroy a city or entire battalions.' I
Diminution of Business. .
The Baltimore C i;iper relates the following j
instances of a falling off in business, and the j2
reason therefor: We are informed by one of
: our depu y sheriffs, that within a few months
past ht* had entirely "lost the run" of a number
of individuals who had previously been
good customers to the state in Iter assault and j
battery departmen . He was astonished that j ,
these individuaals should disappear so sudden- j
ly, without returning once, at least, to shake j 1
hands and bid farewell. A few evenings I

Gkn\ Harrison's Last Letter.
Probably.?We learn from the Commercial
of last evening, that on Saturday
last a hardy, weather beaten, but very respectable
looking seaman presented himself
to the Collector, at the Custom
House, and inquiring for Mr. Curtis, said.
"General Harrison told me to give this
letter into your own hand. He told m<
to give his kind respects to Mr. Curtis,
and said Mr. Curtis was his friend, and
would be my friend." Mr. Curtis opened
the letter, and found it to be, from its
date, one of the last, if not the very las;
letter, written by General Harrison. I
bears date of the day when his illnesjcommenced.
Tucker savs he had no money to come
home by land, hut he did not let the
General know that, for he knew he would
give it to him in a minute, and he did no'
wish to take money from the good old
man who had been so kind to him. And
so Tucker went on hoard the schooner L
L. Slurgis, at Alexandria, and worked his
passage home to New York. When became
to the custom house he had not been
ashore thirty minutes, and having first
heard the sad news of the death of his
kiud benefactor as be passed up the Old
Slip dock, the abundant tears that fell
down his hardy cheek testified that his is
' nrwrrntr>flll heart.
i We are glad to hoar that Mr. Curtis
immediately appointed Mr. Tucker an inspector
of the customs.

We have received interesting news di
J
.cct from China since mv last letter. The
^ |
Manama, of New York, belonging to one
?f our fortunate mercantile houses, arrived
yesterday afternoon direct from Ma.
. ao, and bringing dates twenty-two days
atcr than have been received by way of
England. The Panama arrived out on
the dav the English blockade commenced.
* o
The Commodore, J. Gordon Bremer, who
you will remember, succeeds Commodore l
Elliot, gave the Panama and another
American vessel a special pass, as the i
Captain of the ship says in a note to the
diters, out of respect to the American
ilag, but, as the Commodore is reported
to have said in the Canton papers, under
a pledge, which he had made to the
Chinese, and he could not violate his
word. Be the cause what it may, i!
created no little sensation abroad, and 0
the English residents at IVfaeao, WhamI
pan, and Canton h id made a formal remonstrance.
The Canton papers in the j
British interest had also denounced the 1
net of the Commodore, and the pipers <
are filled with the complaints made. The
news by the Panama, though very late?
the ship hiving sailed on the 6lh?is not
of very great interest, except to the
owners of the ship, who have the benefit
now derived from a cargo of teas. The f
blockade continued, but with groat laxity
as is said. Those having charge of the
expedition are accused of an imbecile j \
management of the whole business, and c
strong complaints will be made in Eng. *
lad to this effect. ;I
In regard to the settlement of differ- [
