It is the desired result, and the h ading

sufficient basis for a loan of ninety or an
hundred millions of dollars, if judiciously
managed. But suppose that only one half

what would be the effect it) oik imports
of negotiating a loan in England, or clsewherein

(. an any one doubt, from past experience?
Vt'e all know the process. Very li tie
gold or silver is ever seen in these ncgo
tiations. A credit is obtained, a d that
placed in bank there, or with wealthy
bankers. Hills arc drawn on this country,
and then sold to merchants. These are
transmitted to Europe, and the proceeds
returned in goods, swelling the tide of i uports
in proportion to the amount. The
crash of our manufactures follow, and
that, in turn, bv the denunciation against
over-importing ami over-trailing, in which
those who have been most active ill causing:
it are sure to join, but will take special
care to make n it the I- ast allusion to
the real source whence it flows. Is not
that the case at this moment? And can it
be doubted, that with the increase <if the)
cause, the clamor for protection will iri-1
crease, until with unite I v oces. the friends)
of the system would demand, its renew I. If!
to this we add, that, under the couipro-?
raise act, the tariff must be revived anil!
remodelled, who can lo<>k at such a concurrence
of powerful causes without see-1
ing that it would he almost impossible t ?
prevent the revival of the protective system,
should the scheme of distribution be
adopted? I hazard nothing in asserting that
the renewal would certainly follow; and,j
as this would bo one of the most prominent.
and durable conscouences of tbati

scheme, I propose to consider it fully,
in its most important bearings.
One of the most striking featuies of the
system is its tendency to increase. Let it
be once recognised, and let the most moderate
duties be laid for protection; but;
put the system in motion, and its course
would be onward, onward, by an irresistible
impulse, as I shall presently show,
from past experience; and hence the necessity
of vigilance, and a determined resistance
to every course of policy that
may by possibility lead to its renewal.?
This tendency to increase, results from
causes inherent and inseparable from the
system, and lias evinced itself by the fact,
that every tariff for protect on has invariably
disappointed its friends in the protection
anticipated, and has been followed
periodically, after short intervals, by a
demand for another tariff ith increased
duties, to afford protection vainly anticipated
from its predecessor. Surh has
been the result throughout, from 1816 to
I5W3, wiicn trie nrst ana last protective
tariffs were laiJ, which I propose now to
show by a very brief historical sketch of
the rise and progress of the system.
The late war, with the embargo and other
restrictive measures that preceded it,
almost expelled our commerce from the
ocean, and diverted a vast amount of capital,
that had been employed in it, to manufactures,
Such was the cause that led to
the -sysi.-ir). kfVr the termination of the
war, there was on the part of Congress and
the country, the kindest feeling toward the
manufacturing interest, accompanied by a
strong desire so to adjust the duties [indispensable
to meet the expenses of G ?vernincnt,
and to pay the public debt] as to afford
them ample protection. The manufacturers
were consulted, and the art of'16
was modelled to their wishes. They regarded
it as affording sufficient and permanent
protection, and I, in my then want of.
.i v .... ........ v ... ..... ,,
did not dream that \vc would hear any more,
of tariiT. till it would become necessary to
readjust the duties, alter the discharge of
the public debt. Vain expectation! Two
years bad not passed away before the manufacturers
were as chm >roi:s as ever for
additional protection; and to meet ?heir
wishes, new duties were laid, from time to
time, with the same result; but the clamor
s:ili returned, till IS2-1. when the la rill" of
i.hat year passed, which was believed on
all sides l" be ample, and was considered.
Jike thai ol" *10. to be a final adjustment oi
the question. It was under this impression
that the South acquiesced [reluctantly]
in the very high duties it imposed.?
'A tie late Gen. Hayno, 'In it a distinguished
ir.crnber of this body, took a very active
p-.rt against it; an 1 I remember, after its
passage, that he consoled himself with the
belief that though oppressive, it would tie
the last. His expectali m proved as vain
as mine in '!<>. Before two years had passed,
we were again besieged with the cry
>f the inadequacy of the protection; and
in the sinnmer of 1S27. a large convention (
of manufacturers fnon a'l parts was held
jat Harris burg, in Pennsylvania, to devise
a new and more ample scheme of protection
to be laid before Congress at tbe next
session. That movement ended in the adoptioo
of the laritl'ol* 1823. which, in order
to ma he sure work, went far beyond
all i;s preilec- ssors in the ;iirreas<* of duty
The duties were rai.se I on the leading ai tides
of consumption from forty to fifty
per criit. above former duties, as high as
they wire. I speak c nijet lurally, wii.ltoni
any reriain dati. In 1. ss than three
years, ven tiat enormous rise proved to
be insufficient, as I shall presently stin.v,

by new demands for protection, had not

enough ?brought the system to the groun I,
against the resistance of ihe administration
and opposition?never, I trust, to rise again.
The fact disclosed by this brief historical
sketch is, that there is a constant ten
lency to increase ii the pr teelive system
that every iicreis-' of duly, however high,
requires periodically, alter a short interval,
an ? Iditional increase. This, as I
j have stated, is not incidental, b it i: is the
result of causes inherent in the system itself.
in the oresent condition of our conn
! try. It originates in th< fact thai ererv
{increase of protection is necessarily t'ul;
lowed by an expansion of the currency,
1 which expansion .mist continue to enlarge
jtill the increased price of production in
! consequence shall become equal to the increased
duly, and when the imp nation of
I the arlices prohibited may again take
place with profit. That is the principle;
and it is essential t > the pcico an I pros,
peritv of tfie country, that it should he
clearly u idcrsl >od, 1 intend to establish its
truth bcyon-l doubt or cavil; an I for thu
purpose, shall begin with the Tariff of
I"y-iS, the last and b> far the bol lest ol the
series, with the view ?f illustrating, in its
ease, the opcrai 01 of the prin.-iplc. I entreat
the Scuab* to give rue its fixed attention.
The principle well understood will
! shed a flood of light on the past and presjent
difficulties -f ihti con try, and guide
ns in safety in our (ntur. course.
To _ivc a clear conception of the operation
of the ta:iff of it will be .cpes<ary
to premise lh.it it comprehended
all the leading articles of consumption'
lha coull he manufactured in our country;
amounting in value to not much less
than one halt of the whole of the imports;
that the duties on these articles were increased
enormously, as has been state'.?
say not less than forty or fifty per cent;
that the average domestic exports at the j
time was not much short of sixty millions
of dollars, and the imports f :r eonsttmp?i
n about die same; that the revenue from
the imports was about half that sum; and
that oi- the exports, about three-fourths
consisted of the great agricultural staples
of the South. What, then, with these
lads, must n ivc occn us necessary opcrations
on the cmrcncy of the manufactur-j
i 11 if States? We export to import. It is !
impossible to continue to export for any j
considerable length of time, without a cor- i
responding return of imports. It would
be to give away our labor for nothing.?
Our exports, then, continuing at an average
of sixty millions, in what, under the
operation of the tariff of 1828, must he the
corresponding iinpoi ts to the same amount
in return! Not, certainly to the same extent
as before its passage, in the articles
on which it had so greatly increased the
duties? Its object i i raising them, was to
imnnf^ciuroG a hnm/? in;>rkpt. hV
excludi.ig the foreign articles of the same
Itscription. If it failed in thai, it failed
in accomplishing any g<iod whatever, and
became an unmixed evil, without benefit to
anyone. Tin return, then, of imports,
must have been principally in articles
on which the duties were not raited,
as far as the consumption of the country
would warrant, and the balance, after
paying what was due abraod, in gold and
silver. The first effect, then, must have,
been to turn the foreign exchange in our1
favor; a most important consequence con- ;
nected with the increase of gold and sil-!
ver in relation to the currency. The next
must have hcen to turn the domestic ex-'
changes still more strongly against the staple
slates, &in favor of the manufacturing.
To understand this portion of lho opera
lion, I must again repeat that the object uf
the tariff was to cut off the consumption of
I the foreign articles, in order tiiat liicy;
!should he supplied by our own inamifac-j
| lures. The necessary consequence of this '
I must have been to diminish the demand
abroad and to increase it in the manufacturing
States, and thereby to turn tho influx
of gold and silver to that point, in order
to purchase their supplies tlierp, which
we have been in the habit of obtaining
from abroad. These causes combined, i
must have had the effect of adding greatly
to the capacity "f the hanks in that quarter
lo extend their discounts and nccom
modations, and with it the circulation of
their notes. x\ ith a growing supply of
specie, and the exchange favorable in every
direction, as must have been the rase,
5liere is no limit to the business ot banks,
nor are they slow to perceive and act on
such favorable circumstances. Nor must
>ve overlook another powerful cause in
operation, the fiscal action of the Government,
through the operation ot which
the vast sums collected under such high
duties, was transferred 10 the sa ne quarter
t^t be applied in the discharge of the
public debt, and disbursed on the innumerable
objects for expenditure there.
( Under the operation of such powerful
causes, there could ri > but be a vast, stid- !
leu expansion of the currency where they'
were in such great activity, ai$! with that
expansion, a corresp Hiding increase of
prices, and the cast of production. Nor!
could this state of things ceas till ihc increased
cost of production become equal
11<> the duty imposed for protection. At
that point, and not before, must specie;
rra-ip to flow in, and the exchange to be:
favorable; but when reached, the tide;
must turn, importations of the protected
articles w mid recommence, specie flow
j out, and exchanges become adverse. Tiiis
| must be so obvious, that itwould only dar,
ken to attempt to make it more clear.?
With the turn of t .e tide the batiks must
contract, ami pecuniary distress and cm,
barrassmcnt follow Such under the operation
of the causes assigned, must be the
result, f>r reasons which appear to me irresistible.
But sir, I do not mean to leave
so important a point to the mere force of
argument, however clear anil certain: I
intend to prove bv incootestible authority
of documents, such was, in fact, exactly
the result. 1 i 'tend t-? pi re the principle
laid down, as I have said, beyond doubt or
cavil.

grieviotisly succeeded the gratifying and
prosperous picture which was so lately
presented?"
What a confirmation of the deductions
of reason, both in t >e swelling tide of prosperity,
and the turning ebb of adversity.
Th.i sketch of the latter is not unsuitcd

The author of the report could give no
satisfactory answer to his question, whence,
all this sudden and unlnokcd for calamity;
hut he has furnished us with the means ofj
tracing it clearly to the tariff of 1S2S. It
went into operation on the 1st of September
of that year, and the next year felt the,
swelling, but delusive tide of an expanding
currency; the exchange turned in our favor;'
gold and silver, following the impulse,
flowed in; banks began to enlarge their
discounts and circulation. It continued

rent, through all the subsequent year, and
the first part of the next, nearly three
j ears, according to the usual period, when
it began to ebb; and then followed the re
verse scene, so feelingly described by the
author, and which to him appeared so tin-:
expected and unaccountable. It was at
this point, had not the movements of the!
South arrested the farther progress of the:
system, that there would have been another.
clamor for additional dudes. The distress
as usual, would have been attributed to
over importation, and that to the want of,
adequate protection, and in 1832, (the u-!
sual period of four years having interven-'
ed,) another protective tariff would hare
been inflicted, to be followed by the same
train of consequences, and with equal dis-j
appointment to its authors
Now, sir, to show that the flowing in of
the precious metals, inconsequence of the
tariff of '28, is not a mere assumption, I;
have extracted from the public documents, j
for the years 1829 and '30, the imports and j
exports of g Id and silver, which I hold in <
inv hand. The import in '29 was $7,-103,- j
(512, and the export $1.311,131. making an I
excess of imports over exports of 83.092,-1
37$; and for 1830. $8,155.904 against $1,-1
241,622, making an excess of imports of!
$6,914,342; making in the two years, an I
excess of imports, of $10,006,810. By'
turning to the report already cited, it will I
be seen that the estimated amount of spe-!i
rie in the country on the first of January,'
1830, was but $25,000.000. of which $5r >
000,000 were in circulation, and $20,0000000
in the vaults of the Banks; so that the i
addition to the specie in the two years I
i

was forty per cent, on the whole amount.
It n?>\v remains to be shown what was
the effect of this great proportional increase
of specie, and the favorable state of
the exchange which it indicates, had on
the banks in the manufacturing States.?
The report will furnish the information,
not fully, but enough to satisfy every reasonable
man. It gives the following statement
of the amount of bank notes in circulation
in 1830 and '32, respectively, in
the States of Massachusetts, Rhode Island,
New York and Pennsylvania, including
the Bank of t! c United States, which will
show the vast increase in the short space
of three years.
Here Mr. C. read the following statement:?
i ai -on nnn (?> * rftn nnn rr

Bank U. States, 15,300,000 21,GOO,000 G7 "
| 38.3)0,000 56,500,000
These are, it will be borne in mind, the
principal manufacturing States. In the
period of two years, we find their bank,
circulation, taken in the aggregate, expanded
from thirty-eight to fi.iy-six and a
half millions, equal to forty-four per cent.
Hut this falls far short of the actual increase.
The year 1S29 is not included.
It must have been one of great expansion,
as the import of specie greatly exceeded
its cxpofts; which, with the favorable exchange
implied, must have greatly increased
the business of the banks and the cir/?nlal!.\n

have hren the case in 1832, which is ineluded;
as we know by the report itself,
that year aud the latter part of the preceding,
was a period of severe contraction.
If a return could he had of 1829,
'30, and the early part of '31, I venture
nothing in asserting that we should lind
the comparison, compared with 1828, the
year of the larifl', far greater in proportion.
That there is no mistake i*i attributing
this great expansion to the tariff; might
be farther shown, if additional proof were
necessary, after such conclusive evidence,
from the fact that it is impossible to assign
any other adequate cause. As far as
can be seen, there was no other cause in
operation, political or commercial, that
could have produced the results, li was
a period of profound peace, and the exports
of the country steady to asi unusual
degree.
Should doubt, however, still remain in
the mind of any one after all this accumulation
of evidence, 1 will next call the attc
tion of the Senate to a fact which must
be conclusive with all disposed to receive
the truth. By turning to ih<* table showing
the extent of bank circulation in '30
and '32 in the four States already referred
to, it will be seen that the expansion was
greater or less, just as the States, respectively,
were more or 1 <ss manufacturing
It will not bo doubted that Rhode Island
is the most manufacturing of the fuur,
and we accordingly find there the greatest
expansion; am! that for the simple reason,
that there the causes assigned must have
been in the state of the greatest activity.
Her bank circulation doubled in the short
space of two years, as appears by the ta
? ?* _ _ . I - ?." 1
ule. Massacuusciis 15 me next; anu we
iitul hers is the next highest, b ing sixtyfive
per cent. New York is still less so,
and hers is but forty per cent.; and Pennsylvania,
the least of the four, had, excluding
the Bank of the United States, increased
only twenty per cent. If the
statement had extended farther South, and
taken in the staple States, I venture little
in making the assertion that instead of expansion,
their hank circulation would, for
the same period, have been found in the ,
opposite state, for the reverse reason. It;
will be seen the Bank of tfie United States
had expanded sixty-seven per cent. Th's
great increase, compared to the local
bunks of Pennsylvania, may probab!y,be
attributed partly to loans negotiated farther
East, and not improbably because her
accommodations were somewhat enlarged,
from causes connected with her efforts, at
the time, to obtain a renewal of her char
tcr.
I trust that I have now established to
the entire satisfaction of the Senate, the
truth of the great principle which has been
laid down?that every increase of protective
duties is necessarily followed, in the
present condition of our country, by an ,
expansion of the currency, which must
continue to increase till the increased price
of production, caused by the expansion,
shall be equal to the duty imposed, when
a new tarilf will be required. Assuming!
then, the principle as iticor.trovcrtable,
it follows that the natural tendency of the
protective system is to expand, in seeking
to accomplish its obj'ct, till it terminates
in explosion. It would be easy to show,:
friiivi u'liat h:m alreatlv been Stated, that !
this tendency must continue till the ex-|
ports shall be so reduced as to be barely j
sufficient to meet the demands of the!
country for the articles not included
in the protection* as it must be obvious, |
so long as they exceed that amount, so;
long must specie continue to be imported, |
and the exchange to be in our favor, till I
thp nrntertion is broke down by the ex-i
pansion of the currency.
The consummation, therefore, of the)
system, must be one of two things: ex- j
plosion, or the reduction of the exports, j
so as not to exceed the amount of the unprotected
articles; but either termination
must prove disastrous to the system; the
former by a sudden and violent overthrow,
and the latter by the impoverish-'
ment of custodiers and raising up of ri-f
rals, as they ceased to bo customers. To'
have a just conception of its operation in
this particular, it will be necessarj' to
bear in mind. that the South and West are
the great consumers of the products of
the North and East; and that the
capacity of the South to consume,
depends on her great agricultural staples
almost exclusively; and that their sale and
consumntion dpriend mainly on the for
eign market. What, then, would be the
effect of reducing her exports to the point
indicated, say to forty or fifty millions of
dollars? Most certainly to diminish her
capacity to consnme the products of the
North and East in the same proportion,
j followed by a corresponding diminution
| of the revenue, and the commerce and
navigation of the country. But the evil
would not end there, as great as it would
be. It would have an equal or greater effect
on the consumption of the West.?
That great and growing section is the provision
portion of the Union. Her wide
and fertile region gives her an unlimited
! capacity to produce grain and stock of
j every description; and these, for the most
; part, find their market in the staple States.*
I Cut off their exports, and lheir market
