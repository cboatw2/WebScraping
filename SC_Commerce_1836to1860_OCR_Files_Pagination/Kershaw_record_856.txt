THE COTTON CROP.
. It is evident, from aU* rtfai^hccounts we jaceive,
that id some pftrta of Couieiana the cotton crop must

besides what is.noWcpen. On most of tbe-otber i
places the crop will fall short oftbat of last year.
- The New Orleans Bulletin .d? 4th inst.' says':?
"We arc' informed from Red River that , the destruction
committed by the" caterpillar fs beyond all example.
The young boils-are all eaten off, and the fields '
which were rephmtefl in- consequence of the over- 1
flow in the early part of the" season, and in which, \
of course, the cotton-islatdrthan elsewhere, areal,
raOst totally destroyed. This'is the case, we are told,
throughout tho parishes of Nafchitoches, Rapides
and Voyelles.' bv tHe -parishes' of St. Martin, also, it

' The probable operation of so i rnportant a change

that while'a varietyofpnrsnitsroonducel greatly to
the .prospe rity.ofa country, I fear that , a Northern
majority,- that sticks at nothing,' wrtl never permit a
black elate population to'be their rivals to imnufactares.

under tJie compromiseTof the ^constitution,- we enjoy
fromihe taxation of that specie* of property, ought
