THE subscril>er informs the public, that he has
just completed the mixture of this valuable medicine.
He takes pleasure in stating that he has
made use of this PANACEA, successfully in a case
of Scrofula, which he has been afflicted with mnfc
than three years. On several Occasions he applied
to practical Physicians for aid, (North and South,)
and received no ?enefit. lie was, at length, prevailed
upon by numerous acquaintances, to try the
virtue of certain ROOTS and HERBS; and believing,
that the Receipt would groat I v benefit him,
he*took it, together with an old French Receipt: from
which is manufactured the VEGETABLE 'PANACEA.
It is proper here to sav, that the quality of some,
or am. the principal Roots, are well known to the
Medical Faculty, by whom they are frequently used.
For Scrofula or King's Evil, 'Tlccrated Sores,
general diseases of the BLOOD, or the effects of
Mercury ; it has a decided salutary effect.
For Bowei. <"*ompi.aint he would also recommend
the use of toe VEGE TABLjE PA V AOEA. Children
nre frequently attacked wi?n this complaint:
especially when teething. A few doses ol the PANACEA
will check the Bowels and they liecome regular
again. It has been tried by a great numbprof
respectable individuals, and pronounced a ''certain
Hire." Ho has tried it at different times in his own
family, and it relieved the child iinuiedi itelv.
This Medicine is simple in its operations; and has
t pleasant taste.
Give it a trial, and judge its worth.
The subscriber will keep a constant supply of the
Panacea at the different Drug Stores throughout
he United States. Orders addressed to the suoscrij'T,
or to Jaiues R. M'Kain, will be promptly attended
to- The PANACEA may always be had at

IT is with great. pleasure ihe solwicriber informs

Lite VEGETABLE ELIXIR. This medicine is
composed of Roots which grow in this State. It is
jsriess-to enter into a detail of the vnluc of ihis Melicine,
(or any other Root medicine,) as it is well
tnown that all. Roots have valuable Medical properties.
He would also state that there is not the
east danger in the use of the Elixir. For the following
named diseases, there is no medicine mnde or
vended at the present time, better calculated to relieve
the afflicted, than the Vegetable Elixir.
For Rheumatism and Consumption, the Elixir
thotild be used internally and externally.
For Dyspepsia or Dysury, lie would also recommend
the use of the Elixir, as he feels confident
it will prove highly beneficial to those who use it.
To those who are articled with Pustules, Eruptive
Distempers, and Venereal diseases, he particularly
recommends the use of the VEGETABLE ELIXIR.
Without the fear of contradiction, he recommends this
Medicine ns the best now'in uhi?as it has proved
successful in every carc in which it has been used.
Orders addressed to the subscriber or Mr. J. R.

Tp HE successor the SOUTHERN TONIC is I
unprecedented. It has been anxiously sought
after by all persons in every part of the United
States, and its widely extended distribution has
been owing to the many requests received from
every section of the South and South West. Although
it originated in an obscure part of the country
but a few years since, it is now found in all the
principal towns and villnges in the Union, and its
virtu's as a cure for Ague and Fever, and as a
general Tonic, are appreciated by all who have
used it Being as it professes a compound of
Southern Vegetables, it is needless to ofler the assurance
that there is no Arsenic,Mercury, nor any
thing in the least hurtful to the human constitution
in it. It will be found a valuable Medicine
in all cases of Dyspepsia and disorganised Stomach
and Bowelsl and ' patients convalescing from Billious
Fever, will derive the most important benefits
from the use of the Southern Tonic. It may
be administered to children and infontB of the most
tender age with the utmost safety. Prepared by

-PATENT COTTON CillV.
' 'HIS Gin can be made double, or single. Ii
B made double, they reduce labor, and gin just
double, the quantify of cotton over the single cylinder
Gin, no other knd having been in use prevous
to this patent; and whether singl^or double, they
are found to improve the quality of the cotton, by
more perfectly cleaning it. They can be made to
r t i-n
uvuwiu nuiii *u 10 xwiiawa in a stand, and whether
small or large, one hand will be sufficient to attend
them. The Gins have mechanical feeders and
hoppers attached to them, which free the cotton
from leaves, trash, dirt, &c. before it can teach the
saws, and by the thorough hackling operation it
receives from the feeders, which make two revolutions
to one of the saws, it is almost in a half
gined state, before it descends to the saw By a
very simple arrangement of a screw to each set of
gaates, on which the hoppers rest, a->d through
which the teeth of the feeders pass, they can be
made to teed slow or fast to suit the condition of
the cotton at the time. When made double, the
saws are placed on two sets of cylinders and turn
upon each other in opposite directions, and are
cleansed by two sets of brushes that have four revo
lotions to one of twe saw. The two cylinders can
be detached so as to enable the planter to run one
or both at pleasure, although embraced with "feeders.
&c. in one stand. The whole is put in operation
with a drum and band, as in the ordinary Gin, and
may be propelled by horse, steam, or water power
It muy also be propelled by iron running gear.
The force required to work it, is about the same as
that necessary to move an equal number of saws in I
the common Gin. This Gin has been put in
operation in New Orleans for two or three weeks,
and its success tested in the presence of a large
number of planters, merchants aud*others, and
received their general approbation
Several gentlemen have been so kind as to give
the Patentee their written opinion respecting the
merits of the Gin. A number of others could be
added, but the following are deemed sufficient:
From his Excellency Gov. White of Louisiana.
New Orleans, Feb. 27, 1837.
Dr. A. Jones?Sir, In replv to your enquiry, 1
what I think of your improved Cotton Gih, 1 haVe
to say, that 1 saw it work on Saturday the 25th inst.
and was very much pleased with its performance.
The mere fact of its self-feeding, seems to me to '
be a very valuable improvement; and besides, the
quality bf the cotton, as it comes out of the process,
appeared to me to be better and cleaner than
vmm uic uiiiuiiKHi v*ius in uiie, and that it saves I
considerably in labor. Respectfully, &c. I
E. D. WHITE. |

that I have taken the liberty of ordering one lor

accompanied by a specimen of the cotton, ginned
by your Patent Gin, I beg leaveto observe, that it
exhibits a decidt d improvement on the usual process
of ginning; delivering the staple uninjured

I lor ; thereby giving the article an additional value.
These favorable impressions of the advantoges of
your Patent Gin, have been confirmed by subsequently
witnessing it in operation. The utility of
the double cylinders and saving of labor, will be
readily perceived and properly appreciated by the
intelligent planter.
Feeling a deep interest in the success of all improvements
tending to benefit the important staplen

From Mr. G. Senior, a Machinist of New Orleans.
Dr. A. Jones?Dear Sir, in answer tc your inquiry
of my opinion of your Patent Cotton Gin, I
beg leuve to state, that 1 was fifteen years ergaf;ed
in the cotton factories of Manchester, Engand,
and during four years of that tin e, 1 was
foreman in the house of Messrs. Lewis, "Williams
Co., and near five years spinner in the house of
Messrs. Sandford & Griene. I have seen your
Cotton Gin in operation, and have examined the
cotton ginned by it, and pronounce it better cleansed,
and the staple less injured, than any cotton
that ever came under my observotion. It is completely
reaily for the breaker without the aid of the
blower, and would, therefore, save the first prcces3
In manufacturing the article. 1 consider cotton
cleansed by your Gin, would command from one
to two cents on the pound more than the average
crops brought into the Manchester market, and
cleansed by common Gins "Yours, very rcsp'ly.

It is desirable, when planters give orders for Gin?,
they should accompany ihrm with their views in
regard to the arrangement of saws, breasts, brushps,
&c. it is found they differ in opinion. Some
desire saws of larger diameter than others. The
most common size is 9 or 10 inches; but some wish
them 12 inches. Some wish 5 or 6 rows of brushes

at most. Some wish saws with 8 or 9 teeth to the
inch, while others want 10 or 11. With so much
discrepancy, we prefer they should, at the time of
giving orders, furnish a statement of their wishes,
and the manufneturerers can fu)61 them in every
particular. Where it is left to our discretion, wc
shall make thfm on the most modern and approved
plan. An order can he exefcuted, from the time it
is received, in the space of eight or .nine weeks,
and the Gin in that time placed in the hands of the
factor. To be in time for the next crop, all orders
ought to be in the hands of the manufacturers by
the first or middle of May; except for plantations
where they are late in commencing to pick or gin
cotton.
