During the voyage the occurrence passed
out of his mind, and on his arrival in
Spain, he did not think to mention it to j
any one, and probably would not have j
dono so now, bad not some casual |
remark in the course of converse- f
lion, induced him to relate* it. '
My attention was immediately attracted
bv the unusual size of the vessel her ma- ,
tcrials, and the columns" which I pre
surne to have been sfanncheons, and as
any incident, however remote, which may
tend to throw some light on the fa'e of
the unfortunate steamer President. [ rom

may make any use of it you may think
proper.
That this was the wreck of a steamer,
and that of large size, both apj?e.ir certain,
and I have thought that perhaps some one i
well acquainted with the steamer might j
recognise in the size of the wreck, her
timbers, the formation of trie hod, the uu- !
usual size and paint of the "columns," or i
stanoheons, the remains of the lost President.
I give you the description of the i
wreck, in the captain's own words, as
nearly as they can he translated.
He further savs that the wreck at the
waters's edge, was about Ho to 40 feet
wide as near as he can recollect, and that
the copper on her bottom was still in a ,
good state of preservation.
i took pains to go on board of this ves
*el to get her exact position at the time of '
falling in with the wreck. I

\ at his residence in Badvenridgc, Somerset
\ county, New Jersey, on Sunday morn- '
ing. the 22d inslant. at t.hc advanced age o
oi* 9> years. lie had enjoyed good r
health, and the full possession of his r
mental faculties, up to within a few davs
of his death, which occurred alter only '
four or five days1 illness, induced h\* fa- "
. ' * *
tigue from walking. I e
As there are few men living who have !?
been permitted to enjoy such length of,
days, so there .re few, perhaps none, who
have enjoyed so great a measure of public 0
respect and confidence during so long a
period, reaching hack far Ifyond (he '
birth of the U<-pubiic. Mr. Southard
was born oil Long Island in the month of; t:
I '
Oeloher, 1747. When he was eight a
years old, his father. Ah a :: rn Southard, u
removed to the colony of New Jersey, 41
and settled at Biskenri Ige, where t 10 r.
family have continued to reside uni.oter- p
mptedlv ever since; which is itself rather .
a remarkable circumstance in this age r?f j
change and progress. When the war of 'J
the Revolution commenced the son en
teted the service, ami conlrihuted to jL
achieve the independence of the country. '
which his subsequent labors and service.- ; I1
in civil hie helped to confirm and est a!)- j
lish.
He was among the earliest members of ,
the Slate Legislature after (he formation ,
ef the Federal Constitution, nod after j p
nerving in that body with honor and use- J li
^ fulness for nine years w as elected a Rep- f
rcsentative in Congress. He continued
in Congress at a period when it was,
indeed, a p >st of iioncr and distinction, 1
by successive re-elections, for llio term off
twenty-one years, when, in IS2i,?dmon- t
ished hv the growing weight of years, he | ^
voluntarily retired, having then passed the j
ordinary limit of threescore and ten. A i
short time previous, his distinguished son
had l>een elected a member of the Senate, J
and they had the pleasure of meeting in a ,
joint committee <>t the two Houses, the
father and son being chairmen of their i
respective committees; a circumstance |
probably without a parallel in our political
history. | 1
During the whole of ibis period, and up
to the hour of his death, Mr. Southard
exemplified the faith of the Christian, not J
less than the steadfastness and virtue of!
the patriot. He was a a communicant '
in the Presbyterian church for seventy I
years, and held tho office of Ruling Elder
for sixty-four; exhibiting during this long j
career those graces and virtues which are
the noblest ornaments of the human char- i
neter, and the memory of which now con
atitutcs his richest legacy to his numerous
family and descendant. Mr. S. leaves 1
several children and grandchildren to
represent him, two of whom have long
heen connected with the public service? j

if the United States :
Fredericksburg, (Va.) May 3f), 1642. ]
The members of the Senate have for some
ime been informed that I have been much
t:disposcd. J have not been able to perform
he du ies of President pro tempore with puncuality,
and in a w ay satisfactory to myself. My
^disposition for the present continues, and to
revent the possibility of either private or
ublic interests being neglected, I feel con.
trained to resign the place which your kindess,
under the Constitution, Laws, and Rules,
unlerred on me, and at the same time to
ender the expression of all that rcgatd and
ood-rrill towards you, individually and col'c
lively, which your kind and respectful conuct
towards me have been so well calculated
j produce. I

SAMUEL L. SOUTHARD.
Mr. Berrien then moved to proceed to

On the first ballot the whole number of i

Jr. Bayard, 13 ; Mr. King, 7 ; Mr. Tall- j
ladgc, 1 ; Mr. Walker 1.
Whereupon, it appearing that Mr. I
languin had received a majority of the

Mr. Mangunt was then escorted to the
hair by Messrs. Miller and Prf.ston,
nd returned his acknowledgements to (

Mr. Linn then rose and offered the folawijig

Sir: I have the honor to .solicit Voitr J

lie immortal Columbus; none of whose
iknnesses, liilherto extant, can bo regard;d

While in charge of our Legation at ;

many fruitless searches in quest of a genuine

which I now present the copy, executed
for me by Senor .Madra7.0, Director of tho
Royal Museum in that capital.
Tho certificate annexed to the portrait, J
by Don Fernandez M. Navnrrcte, will no
doubt appear conclusive as to its superiority
over ether likenesses, to all aware
(nnd all who know him arc so) as well of
his high sense of honor as of his unrivalled

THE PRINTS OP TDK NAILS.
There is nn anecdote told somewhere,
of a young Mussulman, who had succeeded
to his father's estate and honors, hut
who, to the great grief of his mother, did
i not inherit his father's virtues, it was
not the fault of nature, for she had lav.
ished her gifts freely upon him?nor of
education, for he had been placed from
his infancy under the wisest instructors;
nor of example, for he had mingled only
with the good, and seemed to have no
temptation to lead hiin astrav. ? But not.
withstanding his early advantages, and
his early promise of great distinction, and
usefulness, he fell into dissipated habits,
arid was wasting his estate, his reputation
and his health. His mother remonstrated
with hiin, hut in rain. No plea, nor
entreaty, could prevail upon hiin to abandon
his wicked companions, fie seemed
obstinately bent upon his own ruin, and
was plunging every day deeper and deeper
into the vortex from which few escape.
At last his mother, tvh? was fruitful in
invention, hit ugon this expedient in order
to reclaim hiin. She exacted of him
a promise that he would comply with her I
request in one particular. In your little
! chamber, said she, I have placed a keg of j
nails and n hammer, and now for every )
act of your life which your conscience j
admonishes you is wrong, tako one ot J
these nails and drive it into the ceiling of j
your room ; and for every virtuous deed, I
let a nail be extracted. Time rolled on, j
and the ceiling was soon lined with these :
mementos of hi? wickedness, till at length
he became alarmed by their number, and
he resolved to abandon at once his wicked
career. The result was, that nail after
nail was withdrawn, till not a single one j
remained to tell the talo of his former (lis. i
sipnted habits, fie then went to his;
mother, and with feelings of exultation, j
he spoke of the conquest which he had j
achieved. 41 There is not a solitnjy nail," j
said he, 44 remaining in tho ceiling of my

attempt at assassination.
One of the most atrocious attempts to
take away me tire of * ^^iuLL ?iii.
^en that it has ever fallen to our lot to
record oce tired last Sunday night, about
ten o'clock, in the first ward of this city.:
at a building not far distant from the Ex- j
ecutive Mansion. Two assassins enteied
the studio of All. IVitrich, the sculptor,
and, after a severe struggle, slabbed hitn
in two places. This fiend-like and cownrdly
aittack was made, as it is thought,
by two white men with their faces blacked.
Mr. Pettrich received two stabs, on
the left breast and in the abdomen, with
a swordcanc or pointed instrument, which
entered obliquely. It is thought by Mr.
Mil!er, the attending surgeon, that Mr.
Pettrich may recover, although the wounds
are severe and his situation is critical.
We understand that the Mayor, who received
information of the circumstance
about 11 o'clock, remained with Mr. Pettrich
until 12 o'clock on the night of this
atrocious outrage, and took steps to set
the city police on the alert for the apprehension
of the assassins; to whom no
clue, however, has yet been found. It is
earnestly to he hoped that their efforts
ma V prove successful.
Since writing the above wo have just
learned from Dr. Mdb r (at 8 o'clock
P. M.) that Mr. Pettrich is better.?Xal.

siNgulak and horrible murder.
On the morning of the 28th of April
the city of Mexico was thro\Vrt into the j
highest excitement by a report that Mr.
Egrrton* a landscape painter of great
talents, had been inhumanly murdered at
Tacubaya, together with a woman with
whom he lived as his wife?of rare per*
r 11
sonal attractions ana wno aiso posscsscu i
high endowments as a landscape painter.
Tacubaja is a small village .some three
miles from the city of Mexico, and is a
plnce where ninnv families of distinction
reside, especially in summer. The mur.
dered pair was attacked while walking in
the garden of their garden of their resi!
dence. The bodv of Iv'orfon was found
? O
some distance from that of the woman,
run though apparently with a sword.?
i Near him was found his walking stick
j much hacked, from which it is evident
i he made a stout resistance. Tli^t of the
, woman was found, also stabbed nnd nth
erwise horribly mangled, and this indu
ces to the belief that she also resisted to
I the last. She was nwicnfc at the time,
| and within a short period of her delivery
and the perpetrator aim cd her in the
most shameful manner before taking her
life. Her fare was scratched and much
disfigured and a large piece was bitten
j from her breast ; and the perpetrator
| probably fearing that she might not be
j recognized, wrote her name upon a pai
per and pinned it to a fragment of her
j dress, the most of it having been torn ofi
i in the struggle which ended m her death.
The formation of the letters of her name
were plainly English, and this rircumstances
renders it certain that the murder
was neither jdamit-J nor matured oy Mr*
icaiis.
Egerton had a family in England; and |
the woman, when she eloped with him,!
left behind n lover. All these circnm- j
stances, taken in connection with the
i fact thnt nn robbery whatever vns corn- 1
' nutted, favors the supposition generally
I entertained in Mexico that the murder
| was planned in England nnd carried out ,
i us a matter of revenge. Another story
, id that Egertori had been involved in an j
j amour with some fair Mexican ; hut this j
j received but little credit.
