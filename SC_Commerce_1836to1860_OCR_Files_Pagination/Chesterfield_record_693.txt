" Come," said a friend one evening i?
the winter of lr?41. "let uo iook in upor

Have vou not heard about them ?"

most rorimkaLL facta in tlie history o:

' Explain \ ourself."
44 With pleasure. Ahnut nine month.*
ago, perhaps not quilt; .co !on^r, there
were assembled in a drinking-housc in
this city, (Baltimore.) six men, well ad
vnnced in vcnrs, who h;.d lor a iong time
been confirmed drunkards, or, at least,
ho wedded to the love of strong t?rink, as
to have found it almost impossible to live
without a dailv revort to its stimulating
influences. They had met accidentally,
or rather, w ithout am* other design in rem
(
pairing to the bar-room tlinn that which
had taken tiiem there a hundred and a hun.
d:eJ times. But in the mind of each
there was a feeling of sorrow for his enslaved
and wretched condition. A strong
deface to rise out of it?vet a painful,
hopeless sense of weakness. How often,
hI.is ! how often had each made resolutions
of reform. How often had each renounced
the cup of confusion, only to seek
again the bewildering draught, and to
mik still lower in the scale of human degradation
!
Thus they met as they had often met
before; hut neither seemed inclined to call
for the subtle poison that had so many
times stolen away their reason. Soon
the feelings of each became known to the
other*-, and they felt n sudden hope
springing up in their minds?a hope in
ihe power of association. Sad experience
had proven to each one of that little company,
that alone ne could not stand. But
together, &houl ier to shoulder, hand to
hand, and heart to heajX they felt that,
though the struggle woum he hard, they
could and thc\ would conquer!
" In that moral pest-house, then, while i
inhaling with every breath the tempting,
fumes of Ihe potations they loved, did this !
little hand pledge themselves to each oth- !
i i*i _ r : ? !
?r, never again to <Jrmi; any Kinti 01 in-;
toxicating drink?spirits, wine, malt, or
cider."
" '1 hey did not keep their pledge, of;
course," I said, interrupting hirn. 44 Who
oxer heard of a confirmed drunkard be-I
coining a sober man ? The hope for such ;
a re-ult h;i3 Ion? ^inco faded from tho
* % j
minds of the henex olent, and now ?il the:
cfTor's ot tempeiance reformers are turn-!
cd +0 tho keeping of sober men fioni he
coming lovers of strong drink. The'
drnnknrd will remain a drunkard to the j
end of his life ; there is no hope for him." j
44 Do not jump !o conclusions quite so j
hastily," my friend replied. 44 The re is!
h< pe for the drunkard, let mo tell you..
Itut hear me out patiently- These six I
men. cocn after thoj* led thus pledged;
tin to each other, determined that j
they would make ?n ctfort to increase<
their number. They accordingly organ-.
?<Vu vf?ciety, and called it the 4 Washing- j
inn Temperance Society.' Then they j
went to some of their eld companions,,
told thern what they had done, and invi-j
tod them to join their society. A few j
were found to break away from their hon- i
dn^e and unite w ith them. Thus their
f tact and influence became increased.
hers soon followed the samo example,,
and it was not. long before the society ;
numbered o**er one hundred members,
each one of w hom had been lor years in
the habit of drinking, and most of them
i rr?*;?nnj)y to intoxication.
\11 this time, each member was using
n'l his poweisof reasoning and persuasion j
to induce bin old companions to come in.!
Some would, on the nights of thtir meet- '
ings, station themselves near the grog.';
shops they had formerly been in the;
habit of \ isiting, and intercept those w hom J
thev knew, before lhey had reached the j
doors thev were decking. Then they'
" / I
would reason with them, and persuade
them to come to the society ; if not to
join, at least to hear. In this way numhers
were added. Such members as had
no work, were aided as far as possible.
and efforts wcro made to procure work
for them.
41 And thus the reformation has gone
on. and now 'The Washington Temperar.ee
Society* numbers several hundred
members, nearly every one of whom had
f ecu in the habit of drinking to the extent
of serious]) mniring his prospects in life.
iiverv week they meet regularly, for tho
uceplion of new mcmbeia and mutual
? mouragemcnt. And these meetings
areol a highly interesting nature. Is.
unity, some of the members relatn theii
experiences, and these are frequently
.-.di eting in a high degree."
' Surely you must be drawing on your
imagination. The thing surpasses belief.1'
"I have not told you half. But come.
Let us go to the meeting ; this is tho reg.
ular night."
There was no hesitation of course. In
m ft:w minutes we entered a largo room
nt tlie corner of Hanover and Lombard
streets, which we found crowded to excess,
with men of all ages, mostly meO
y
clianics .and working.tnen. Wc pushed

and then turned to survey the countenance*
of tilt* assembly. It was a sight
to move the heart. There were men,
oht and gray-headed, and youths scarcely
eighteen, into whose very vitals had been
fixed the tooth of the destroyer. .Men
wlio had been slaves, some for a long series
of years, to the most degrading vice.
But now "they stood up as heeinen, and
there was scarcely n face, marred sadly
some were, that had not an expression of
serious, manly determination.

mcnts over the scene that presented itself
; t when the President invited those who
I
! wished tojoin the society to come forward
and sign the pledge which was read. It
was in these words :
I
j We whoe nanv-s are annexed, desirous of
forming a society tor our mutual benefit, to
guard against a peruiciou* practice, which it
injurious to our health, standing and families, j
{ do pledge our.-eives as gentlemen, that we will j
not drink any *pniious or malt liquor*, wine or i
: cider."
I I
; A dead silence ensued, which lasted j
; for only a moment or two, when a slight ;
| noise was heard in a far corner of the j
j room. Then there was a motion in the j
j dense crowd, and presently a man was
; seen coming up the aisle. He was
; scarcely past the prime of life ; but had a
look of premature old age. His face was j
i so swollen and disfigured, that the evo
I . *
turned away from it involuntarily.
" Do von think there is anv use in me j
signing it 1" he asked, as he paused at the j
; table on which the books of the society j
; rested, trembling from head to foot, and j
! gazing up, appealing!}*, into the face of!
the President. There were few who j
! looked upon the wretched being who did 1
; not feel a rising emotion of tenderness !
, 1
j 3nd compassion.
44 Yes I do," was the prompt and posi- |
j tive reply. 44 It is the only thing that
j can save you. And it will save you !"
44 O sir, do you really think so 7"
44 I know so ! Sign it at once, and
: you a free man."
! 441 will! I will !*' the poor creature said, !
i in an earnest tone, taking the pen that the
! Secretary held cut to him, and putting,
with an eager, trembling hand, his name !
to the pledge.
44 Abide bv that and you are safe." j
said the President, smiling. 1
441 will try," responded the man, and i
his tones were steadier, and had some. ?
thing of confidence in them : and he <
C? '
seemed really liken changed being, full I
O ~
of hope and resolution, as he turned from <
the table and mingled in the crowd.
o
Then came another and another until
forty-nine had signed the pledge.
4* Come along! We have room for 1
another one. We must have fifty to- I
night," said the President, in a loud, '
cheerful encouraging tone. " Como a- i
long with us, and we will do you good. ]
Who will make up the fifty ?"
For nearly five minutes the President
waited, hut no one came forward. Just
as the pledge hook was about to he closed,
there was a movement near the middle
of the room, and then there came tottering
up the aisle, a feeble old man, with a
head as white as snow. He seemed at
least three score and ten, for he was bent,
and leaned on hisstnfF, and his face was
that of one very far advanced in years,
though it was, painfully disfigured by
signs that none could look upon and
misunderstand. Me came up elowlv,
letting his stick fall at every step,
and evidently trusting to it for support.
Theiewas a deep and breathless silence.
The President, who had been talking almost
incessantly for half an hour, urging,
inviting and encouraging persons to come
forward, censed his rambling address,
and stepped forward a pace or two to meet
the old man.
44 Let rne sign?lot mo sign !" ho said,
in a low, agitated voice, and the Secretary
handed him a chair, into which ho
sank feebly, and then took tho pen that .
was offered him. Hurriedly, as if he
feared that his resolution would fail him, !
did he subscribo to the pledge. As he I
lifted the pen, a tear fell upon his name. j
Silently ho then arose, and slowly reI
tired. His clothes were old and worn,
| and his coat seemed, from its appearance, 1
i to have seen almost a quarter of a cen;
tory. Bill it was whole in every part,
though patchf.fl with almost innumerable
i . t !
j pieces, and of various shades. The few I
j thin white locks that covered his head
were smoothly combed and parted. The
bosom of nis shirt was clean but coarse,
and a white cravat was tied about his
neck with a care that indicated plainly
1 enough, ns did his whole appearance, that
a woman's heart had cared for him, and i
a w oman's hand been busy about his person.
I felt naturally, as did every one, a j
strong interest in this old man, and when :
il.e meeting broke up, 1 kept my eye upon :
him, and followed out closo behind him.
At the door I parted with my friend, as it
; wnslate and we had logo in opposite dij
rections. The old man was but a few
i paces in advance of me, as 1 turned up i
| Hanover .street ; I lingered behind, half!
: resolved to follow hun home. When he j
came to .liaruei street, no crosseu over j
and proceeded on wcstwnrdly. I was ;
but a few paces behind him when he!
came to the narrow street now called j
Little Sharp street, mostly filled with j
! poor and comfortless tenements, many of
which are inhabited by blacks. Into this
j he turned, and scarcely yet determined :
i as to what I should do. I followed closely
| after. It was past the hour of ten, and
the night was very cold. A keen norlh;
wester was blowing, and, as I turned into
j this little street, the wind came rushing
down with chilly violence. The old man
seemed to shrink in the cold blast, bs if
its benumbing influence had penetrated
his thin garments, nnd reached every j
l . r L _ L _ J.. f L 1 ,1
pari 01 ms nony. i nau proceecieci oni
wards but a few steps when a female
i urc darted pa?t me, and paused at the
| old man's side.
1 " Oh father t" ?a?d a low. anxious, 1
Uc:rX'..~? L-rt hv-r yovi bee*. ? ;
.nn^.wnwi
\ I linvc searched after you for more than !
] an hour."
I The reply was made in so low a tone
j that I (*oiiId not hear it.
| " Are you r.ot very cold ?" the da ugh:
fer n-keo, as the two moved on, the old j
I i .i.? ?r.
> i111 n Railing upon intuitu ui mi Liiini iui
j support.
" No. Kite," I could hear him say, "I
J am n< t ;cry cold, f'ut if you have been
lout for an hour, this hitter night, you |
| must be chilled to the heart."
Just at this moment the two passed under
u lamp, and I could see that tiie outer
1 dress of the voting woman was very poor
j and thin, and that it clung to her slender
j form as the wind swept past hor, showing i
| that beneath this were but few comfort|
able garments.
I fell the truth of what the old man!
said, for, wrapped up as I was in a warm j
cloak, I was yet very sensible of the ex- j
treme cold. Hut the daughter made no
reply.
No other word was spoken, cr at least
none other caught my ear. In a few minutes
the two stopped before a low frame
house, of but a single story, with a loft,
or attic above. Into this they immediately
entered, and the door was quickly
closed after them.
If I had Celt an interest in the old man, J ]
I now felt a far deeper interest in
(hat gentle bring who, under Such paitifiii j
and trying circumstances, could cling to j
him as she evidently did, like a guardian j
angel. There was a deep.toned, unutter.
able tenderness in her voice, as she mur-1
inured the word 41 father," that moved :
my feelings. And there was something j
in her manner, and carriage, obscurely
seen in the feeble glimmering of the street j
lamp, (hat fold of better days.
I lingered for a minute or two, irreso !
lute, after the door had closed upon them, j
and then turned away, resolved to know j
more about that old man and his daugh- j
ter. What I subsequently learned, I will . I
now present in the form of a simple, connected
history. And if it mikes the *
same impression upon the mind of the 3
reader that it did upon my own, on turn- t
gin the last page of the narrative, ho will, *
even if he have said it a hundred times 1
before, feel like saying more fervently f
still to the 44 Washingtonians," the "Jeff- e
arsonians," and others of kindred nssocia. u

DISTRESSING OCCURRENCE.
Wo have rarely been more derply
mined than wo were at tho relation of f
the casuality we are about to record. On ,
* x
Wednesday, of last week, the lady of
Mr. William George, residing on the
O ' O
Liberty Road, eight miles fioin Haiti,
rtore, placed her infant daughter, aged
ibout three months, upon a bed, spreading ioin-:
light covering over it, where she
eft it in gentle repose. A short time af. 11
cr, the servant of tho family entered the .
ipartment with a bundle of clothes and
without perceiving the child threw them
ipon tho bed where they remained until "
he anxiety of the mother was excited by
he protracted slumber of her infant,
vhen, unconscious of tho servant having . T
nlered the npartment, she hastened to a
no bedside, but who can describe her ago- j c
iv at finding her litilo one cold in death,! ^
suffocated by the weight thus heedlessly 1
daced upon it. S?? severe n pang para- 1
yzed her every faculty and rendered her '
indeed a being to he pitied?and even at j
the present moment, we arc informed, she j
can scarcely be made to acknowledge tho '
reality of iier melancholy privation.

j (
Tobacco a Remedy for Arsenic.?A j 1
young lady in New-Hampshire fell into 1 ^
the mistake so often committed, of eat- .
ing a portion of arsenic which had been .
prepared for the destruction of rats. Fain- c
fill symptoms soon led to inquiry ; and j c
her mis lake was discovered. An elderly | c
lady who was present, advised that she j(
should be made to vomit, ns speedily as ; 1
possible, and as she had always felt a per- j1
foot loathing for tobacco in every shape, j
it was supposed that this would at once j j
effect the purpose. A pipe was used, but <
without producing the nausea. She next I
chewed a large portion of strong tobacco, j
and swallowed the juice, and that even j]
without a sensation of disgust.
A strong decoction was then made of
hot water, of which she drank perhaps
half a pint. Still there was neither nausea
nor dizziness, nor did it operate at
all. cither as an emetic or cathartic. The 1
painful semations at her stomach, however,
subsided, and she began to feel well.
0:i the arrival of physicians, an emetic
of blue vitr;ol was administered, and produced
one operation. One or two days
after there was a discharge of dark green
color, approaching to black. No ill consequences
followed.
Another case oceured in the same place
a few years subsequent, in which arsenic
was taken through mistake, by a sick
person, and she employed tobacco with
the same success. She, loo, had always
loathed the article, but now chewed it,
and swallowed the saliva, without producing
sickness at the stomach. No emetic
was administered nor any other remedy.

lj-1 i Ulivoim. Agriculture
is the foundation of all human j
arts?the art for which man was made, and ;
the perfection of which is his chief happiness j
and glory as the lord temporal of this planet* i
Of this sublime art, all other arts and sciences
are hut satellites, their business being to wait j
on, enlighten, and adorn it with their moon- j
shine. Consequently no man more ttian the
agriculturist needs the full use of his brains, ''
and a perfect command of all the treasures of
human experience. So the farmers of the
United States view the matter; and in pre.
senting them with a translation of the celo.
brated .Maison liustique, of the French, we
have no doubt of their hearty support. It ic j
the work of all works on practical agriculture j
?the most scientific, clear, and ccmprrhen- j
sive, France has long excelled in profitable
farming. This is the source of her wealth. |
England is rich by coals and commerce, Her j
agriculture is splendid, but sometimes costs j
r? more
than it comes to. Those who have !
fortunes to spend may buy the vast works of J
Marshall, Dickson Arthur Young, Loudon, i
&c., but those who wish to get a fortune out '
of lhe soil will find the French writers better
able to show them the way. The excellence j
or French elementary works is well known to j
all teachers. For centuries, the .1/aison j
R/istlc: h i* in France, the
elementary work?the spelling book and
grammar of /arming. The present edition for
44 the nineteenth century/' has be^n re^writ'ten
and brought up with the 44 march of mind/'
by sixty of the ablest "agronomea" of France.
It has all the light of the latest improvement?,
not only in France, but in all Europe.
William Cobbet, one of the most successful
fanners both in England and America, who
wrote the best style and the best French
crammer that ever was, valued the Maison
Rustiques, not only as an encyclopedia of
farming, but us a means of educating his
children. He was his own schoolmaster. In
winter pvpnintra his family rp?nlve?l itnolf into
a school, and ho thus speaks of the use then
made of this work:?
44 Our book of never failing resource wag

which, it is said, was the book that first temp,
ted Dugnosnois (I think that was his name,)
the famous physician in the reign of Louis
XIV., to learn to read, Here are all the fourlegged
animals, from the horso down to the
mouse, portraits and all; all the birds, reptiles,
insects; all the modes of rearing managing,
and using the tame ones, and of destroying
those that arc mischievous; all the varions
traps, springs, nets; all the labors of the field
and garden exhibited, as well as the rest, in
plates, and there was I, in any leisure moments,
to join this inquisitive group, to read
the French, and tell thein what it meaned in
English, when tht picture did not sufficiently
explain itself. I never have been without a
copy of this book for forty yearp, except during
the time that I was fleeing from the dungeons
of Ca9tlereagh and Sidmoutb, in 1817, and
when I got to Long Island, the first book I
bought was another Afaison Rustique.*'?Advice
