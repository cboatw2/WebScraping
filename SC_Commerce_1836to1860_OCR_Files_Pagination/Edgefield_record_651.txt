ORIGIN OF THE LFE MEDICINES.
T I EI reader may not perhaps he aware
thfsat the rigin of Moffa's Life Medicinles
was the result of a protracted and painful ill
esesoftheirorigiunter.Mr John3fMolfat. When
taken all. Mr. M. was a prosperous and flour
i-hing nscrchaut in tle lower part of the city of
New York; anid having consulted and employed
u umnuber of our mait skilful physicians. ie,
af&er iontihs of auffesi"i, was prevailed upon
to purchase the recipe ot the imvaluable vege
table pireparatis now offered to the public.
Th e:Yvet of the Life Mediciseis in his own
case was so singular nnd remarkable. that he
immediately determined to oTer to tb- world a
asnedicine to which he not only owed his life.
but his hapiness. The s:mifor:n .uccess which
a
has since atteuded their adiniistration n eve
ry instance. where a fair trial has been given I

contestibly proves their itrinsic tnerit.

Gentlemen:-The nercantile communi
ty has for some timc directed its attention
to the suggestion of some reason-s by w hich
you might lie induced to pack your coton

Many plans have been proposed for a
more rapid advance in putting up Cottons
in the shape recotinendel.
Atone time, it was considered, that a
premium on the square package might be
eflecit.al, or that a deduction made on the
round baic, would accomplish the object.
The opinion has prevailed, that the hiet
ter course would be to address your inter
ests by a dill'rent imude; knowing, that
you vourselve, imust be convinced Is ex
pierinent, that tile cuttutn you inve packed

PRoTECTIoN FROM Lts0oT.M.N.
The torthconung number of the Ameri
can Itepertory contains the details of a
plan 1-or protecting cities and shipping from
the e-fer. of lightniug. which will be read
wish mtrh jiticrest. It is a singular cir
cuust.antce that the plan appearu to havoe
beien h upon almost simultaneously is
thi cutary and in France. In the latter
it has bcen proposed, as we learn from
G;alli;:uani's les-senger. by M. Arco, witha
a %iew ifdi-charging clouds of their elec
tm- fluid, and thus prevenitng hail-storms.
which nre generally produced by t wo cur
rents of clouds charged with positive anl
nle;;aive electricity. crossing each other.- -
.\. Ar::o recomtmends that a small balloon,.
priperly secured, armoed with netaille
points and communicating with the ground
by a rope. covered with tmetallic wire liku
a harp-string, should be kept perntnenth
floating in the air at a considerable heigh&
over the spot which it is wished to pre
serve- fromti she eftfcts of lighrning or hai!.
nod he expects that by such an npparatuos
as thiE, a cloud might have its content.,
entirely drawn ofT. ie proposes this i,
an imssprovCment upon Frankliti's experi
mnuct cof the kite, with which he obtain.1
electric sparks front a cloud.
fu this country a similar plan was tn.
tured several months ago, and commuui
ated to some scientific gentlemen bly MUr.
1. A. Powers of this city. This was long
before Mr. Acago's plan was given to the
public, which shows that the ideas wers <
in detail. and proposing more extended
awd practical beuefits.
1r. Powers proposes elevating. at the
approatli of the thittder cloud, a halloon
of oil silk, arned at tite top with a hollow
metallic cooe with several finely pointed
ramI iiications. anal surroundeh by two thi,
ssetahic' h-inda cr.wsing each either at
right angles and cennaectiug the cone with
a rope wound wi th metalli A ;e which
.shouhl reach to the earth an-i hr conne'ted
with a metal frame work, by which thie.
balloon aay lie depiessed oir elevated at
pienssre. Tle frame ahoulh ha% t me
tallic communication 15 or 20 feet e-.
the surface of the ground, so that th, a -
tric fluid may be snore readily dis-a;;.
This is a general view of the plasn; % -
lave not room for further particular.
There is little doubt that if'cnrried in.,,
practical 4zperaiion clouds could he easily
dfisch:rged of their, electricity. and reu
dered entirely harmless in that respect.
The Repertory states that 31r Power.;
has nmatured a plan expressly for protect.
irig this city, by which, for an nenual ex.
petse of three cents on each building. ie
proposes to protect the w!...-e city nod tls
shipping in she harhir, and that ihe plan.
o;;ether with modcli, &c. illustrative of
its practicability, will shortly be msade
pubhlic.
