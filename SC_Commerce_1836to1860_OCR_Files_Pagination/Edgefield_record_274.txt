Tim ElPIRE OF LAW IN MIssSSIPPI
-As law is but the expression of the put>
lic will in its most tinimpassioned d sol
emn fort, it is preposterous to think ofulp
position to it in any other ilian a legal wuy.
We disabuse the great body of the citizen.,
of Mississippi. of any wish tio trample upon
or to overthrow the laws which have been
framed by their united wisloin and expe
rience. And , hile we admit that tnany
outrageous individual acts of violence have
been perpetrated in various parts or our
state, we can account for them wnithout
'feeling a single rear for the stability of.law.
and without any painful anxiety lest the
eitements of misrule and anarchy should
gain'the ascendtncy in our community.
The causes of Irritation and pecuniary
depression are most evident; first, the cred
it system, and the extreme facility with
. which planters. just opening their planta
tions, could obtain advances fur the pur.
chase of negroes from commission houses
-which advances were obtained by those
houses from the banks. Such sudden and
easily obtained suins of money could not
but engender habits of speculation, waste
fuliess or improvidence ror the future.
We are now seeing and feeling the 'begin
ning of the end' of such a course. The
inflictions will, in some cases, he bitter;
pride will, be humbled ,s property chan
ges hands-yet we feel confideuit that law
and right will be sustained-thai the dis
cordant elements ofpassion will be hush
ed to rest by the general prevaleice of
good feeling and the love of order inher
-nt in the better portions ofour conmmtinity.
