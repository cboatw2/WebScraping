Col Campbell's Letter.
Letter o ? the Hon. John Campbell to a torninitio
of a Democratic mooting held at Marion
C. H.
Ma rlborougu August 15, 181 "*. j
Gentlemen.?I have the honor to ackm
wlodge the receipt of your letter of the 15th
Hist, enclosing a resolution adopted at a meeting
of the Democratic, party, held at Marion i
Court I louse, in the words following, to-wit:
>% Reached, That a committee of three be !
- appointed to address a letter to the Hon. John i
Cainpbeli, and request hi:n to give his views
on the approacbuig Presidential election, and
in case the election should come into the
House of Representatives, what course he
would, pursue."
At the organ of the Democratic party for j
earryrng the above resolution into effect, you
have,'after recommending the resolution itself j
ho my'consideration, propounded the following
interioga'ories 1st. Are you in favor of the !
re election of Mr. Van Buren as President of |
the United States ?'f " 2ndly. In case the el- !
cction fyl'reaider.t should come into the House i
of Representatives, which of the two candidates
would you vote for ?"
Before 1 proceed to answ. r your letter, I
hope that I will be indulged in saying that al- :
though in common, as I presume, with every '
citizeh of the country, I feeia lively interest in J
the subject of your communication, I had hoped 1
after a session unparalled for its duration and,
perhaps for its excitemenf, to have passed the
short recess principally in the tranquil pursuits
of a planter's life, and 1:1 the enjoyment of the
fociety of iny neighbors, undisturbed in a great
measure by lit" political storin that is sweeping
over nhc land. This disposition ( still
think may be indulged consistently with my
duties to my constituents and to the country.
For whatever eause of excitement may exist
in most of the States of the Union upon the
Presidential election, w hich now in politics44 is |
the Aaron's rod that swallow sup ail others," j
there is none in South Carolina. The vote 1
of our State is not doubtful, and if a few of our
Districts elect gentlemen to the Legislature
\vh?? advocate me election of the opposi ion :
candidate, the result will riot thereby be affected.,.
My opinions, however, upon this subject, '
1 believe, are well known. During the late
canvass foi Congress, there were frequent occasions
in which 1 expressed my preference of
the present incumbent of the Presidents. Clair
over either of the probable n >tn nccs of the j
llarrisburg convention, and of the party by
which thai gentleman is supported, to the northern
and western divisions of the party by which
iio is opposed. In a few remarks which I h id ,
the honor to submit to the House of Represent- ,
stives previous to its org tit izition, on the agita
t rig qaosiioH which for a time involved us ppa. ;
really ina siato of almost hopeless confusion (an
abstract of which was published both in the Globe .
and the National lutePigcncer) I avowed the
satno profeiencts. Refuse and since the noniinwfliun
of the opposition candidate, without in. j
trutfing- my opinions u here 1 thought liiey were
uncalled lor, or entering as au clectionecrcr into
me l\evidential canvass, oi circulating docu:n- j
meuis except to a very limited extent, not in !
?Qme way connected with' the proceedings of <
Congress (an omission which I have been morli- :
fiodiolcuin lias been the suljccl of complaint i
with some of my constituents 'I have, upon
what i considered suitable occasions, invariably
expressed tuo same sentiments.
But, gentlemen, it is known to yon that I have
<1 iff,-red. a? 1 still do, with a l?rg? incjonty of the
t-rtnro pri fjr, upon an important !
feature ot a prominent measure winch has now
. . I . . ?w Ifn - H UU 'UP I* xrrfT?'v I.? ?.
probable that my opposition to this measure may
have been interpreted by some as an opposition to
tire administration by which it was reroumicndcd,
you can readily appreciate the delicacy of my
poshtoh in making a public declaration of my i
.opinions, if those opinions are to influence the i
s access of gentlemen of virtue, intelligence and j
patriotism, who arc now before you as candid- j
utes for the Stale Legislature, and who at the ;
last election supported me with a noble devotion ;
to w hat they believed was right against what ap I
poured to be very unequal odds. Important, how.
cvor, as the Presidential election may be, the.
citizens of thedifT renttlisrtcls that compose this
congressional district, w ill I trust select their
candidates for. the Statu Legislature without ,
reference to that subject; for all know ,
that * hot loir we elect gentlemen to the State
legislature who prefer Gen. Harrison, or gen- <
llemcn who prefer Mr. Van Buren, the result

slightest degree cither increa id or diminished
as a member of;fie Union.
Subjects have been discuss* d in the party
. prints, an?l in the electioneering pamphlets
with which the country lias been inundated on
the Presidential election ; which as thev have j
m> reference to the genera! politics of the coun- !
try, and whether true or false, do n??t affect
the qualifications of either of the candidates
for that high station, I will passover without
observation. Nor will ] in attempting to sus- j
; taitt my preference for one of the candidates, j
intentionally depreciate the personal claims uf j
the other?a man, who, let detraction say
wnatifmay, has long and faithfully served his
country, both in poacennd in war, and whose
errors upon [x.htica! subjects, so I r as indicated
by his votes and published opinions, have
not perhaps, been much greater than these of
his opponent.
llavihg made th's remark, am disposed in its
vindication to compare Mr. Van Huron's and |
Gen. Harrison's opinions upon certain leading J
questions ol vital importance to southern inter- j
os Is.
1st. Upon the suljcct of abolition. After
having endeavored with souio care to inform
myself in relation to Gen. Harrison's opinions ;
upon this subject, I have come to the conclusion
that lie has no sympathies in common with ,
- I I* CI 4 _ A I
he abolitionists of the noil siavcnoiuing oraies.
The proofs of this, I th.nk are to be found. 1st.
in his vo'eon the proposed Missouri restrict- I
ions. 2nd in his speech delivered at Cheviot, ]
Ohio,on the 4*h July, 1833. 3d, in his speech de. |
ercd at Vinrcnus, Indiana, when he was be- I
fore a candidate for the Presidency. 4th, from
. numerous letters which he has at different!
times written to gentlemen in various parts of
the slave holding States, particularly in his letter
to Mr. Lyons, of Richmond, Virginia, written
as late as the first of June last and publish- i
ed in opposition to his request ; and5th, in the
unmeasured denunciations of the abolition j
prints.
That Gen. Harrison did in 1533, speak fa- j
vorably of appropriating the surplus revenue
cf the General Government, not only to the !
eoloirzition of persons of color, who were al- |
ready free; but to the purchase of the freedom, i
* of others, with the consent of the States hold-1
- ing them there is no doubt?and that at j
the age of 18, he became a mc mber of a socio- j
ty in Richmond. Virginia, which in 1822, and i
since, he.!ias designated by the title of" abol- j
ition society but which in his letter to Mr.!
Lyons, be disclaims all recollection of having I
done. " At any rate," he says " the word
abolition was not understoed to mean in 1822,
what it now means. There can be no doubt
that the society of which Mr. Tarlton Pleasants
was a member, and which in his publira- |
ticn, in the Richmond Whig, he calls the Humane
Society of Richmond,'was the name of
lb? one which t wps a member."
WliO'.V i C.r. Huns-o:: h..? beer; ru Py of
I lite baseness of designating this {Society kby,
i different titles to different persons for the pur"
pose of gaining "golden opinions from allse's of J
inen" is a controversy into which I am not all'
disposed to enter. But a Society formed at I
Richmond in Virginia, in the very heart of the
slave country, in the Capitol of that State, t
which has been called the mother of Slates j
and of great men, in her palmy days, the days, !
I of Washington, Jefferson, Madison,
Monroe and others ; bv whatever tittle called, i
had probably but Ititle affinity to the abolition
Societies of the present day.
These charges which have been so loudly ,
rung against General Harrison at the South,
to wit, that he advocated a distribution of the !
surplus revenue to purchase our slaves, and
thai lie was a member of an Abolition Society,
stand upon his own declarations. The voluntary
confessions of an individual charged with j
offences are always ?steemed good evidence!
against him, but it frequently happens that:
great injustice may bo done if a mere isolated i
deciaraiioti is allowed logo tothejury discon- [
uectod with the circumstances under which it ;
was made or W'th other parts of the same, or 1
of different conversations tending to throw light
upon it. Hence* the humanity of our Iuvvb, requires
even id the case of the greatist criminal, '
that he shall not be convicted upon his con- j
fessions, without allowing the circumstances ;
tending to explain them to be taken into con- |
6i(]eratior?.
I Believing that justice in the present case re. :
I quires a similar rule to be extend'd to Gen. >
! Harrison, and that the 44 quo ammo" under i
i which the declarations alluded to were made, .
| cannot be properly understood without, I will,
at the risk of being thought prolix, tnake ehoit .
; extracts from the speech in which he advoca- [
| ted a distribution ot the surplus revenue to the
cause of colonization, with the consent of the '
k!:ii-p KtatMis in the cause emancipation : and !
I after I have done so, I will make an extract
j from the first published letter in which lie stated
tnat at the age ol eighteen he nad become
a member of an Abolition Society, and that j
the " obligations he had then come under he
had faithfully performed."
In his speech delivered at Cheviot, Ohio, in :
1933, alter alludiug to the disposition of per- j
sons in the non sl.iveh<?ldiug stales to interfere :
with the slave population in other s'ates, and '
declaring his conviction, that, under the con- ;
stiution ot the United States, the slaves were
under the exclusive control of the states that
pessessed thetn, lie proceeds. " Shall 1 be ac- j
cuscd of a want of feeling to the slaves by j
these remarks ? A further examination will i
e'ueidate tlie mat'e. 1 take it f ?r grantee j
that no one will say that either the Govern-j
mont of he United S ates, or those of the non
sla^e holding, States, can interfere in any way
with the right of propeiiy in the slaves. Upon
whom then, are the misguided and pretended
friends of the slaves to operate? It must be I
either on tlie goveruir cut of the slave holding |
states, the individual who hold them, oi the I
slaves themselves. What aie to be the argir j
tuei ts, what the means, by which they a.e to ;
influence the two first of these 1 Is there a
man hold enough to go the |rtnd of Madison, j
and of Craw ford, and tell thcin that they eh her j
do not understaud the principles ot the moral !
and political rights ot man, or that understand- i
nig they disregard them! Can they adJre&s
an argument to the interests of the eulighcn. I
ed population of the slave states, that has not j
* - i - i _ .i
occurred to themselves a mousanu ai.u a inuuand
times ! To whom, then arc they to ad
dress themselves but to the slaves, ar.d what j
"""1 Kn oaul lit llium.tlt't' -? II mil Uati 1it 'JlP ,
muiscriintuate slaughter ot every ago and sex, j
and ultimately to their own destruction!
Should there be an incarnate devil, who has I
imagined, with appiobation, such a catastrophe
to his fellow-citizens as 1 have described,
let him look to them fur whose benefit he
would produce it. Particular sections of the i
country may be laid waste, all the crimes that j
infatuated man under the influence of ail the
bhek passions of his nature can commit, may
be perpetrated lor a season, the tides of the
ocean, however, will no more certainly change
than that the flood of horrors will he arrested
and turn upon those who may get tl in motion. |
" I will not stop to inquire into the motives I
of those who are engaged in this latal and un- 1
constitutional project. Tnern may be some I"
who have embarked in it without properly con. i
sideriiig the consequences, and who are uclu" j
aled by benevolent and virtuous principles ;
i5Ul II sucn UKTC arc, i nm vcrj cwiiaui uiui,
should tlioy continue their present course, their i
Jcllow-citizens will t re long curse the vutues
winch have undone their country.
{Should I be asked, is there no way by
which the General Go* eminent can aid tlie
cause of emancipation ; i answer that it has !
long been an object near my heart to see the i
surplus revenue appropriated to that object, :
With the sanction of the {States holding the |
slaves, there appears to me to be no constitutional
objection to us being thus applied em- j
bracing not only the colonization ol those that J
may be otherwise treed, but the purchase ol 1
the freedom ol others, liy a zealous support i
ol a plan formed upon this basis, we might look ;
forward to a day when a North American sun j
would not look down upon a slave. To those ;
who have rejected the plan of colon.zation, 1
, would a?k if they have well weighed the consequences
of emancipation without it! How long
would the emancipated negroes remain satis 1
fiod with that! Should any one of the SouthI
t-rn States, their negroes armed and. organ-j
ized; be able to resist their claims to a par- j
ticipatton in all their political rights.1 Would
it even stop there? WoulJ they not claim admission
to ail the social rights and privileges of j
a community, in which in some instances, they ,
would compose the majority ? Let these who j
take pleasure in the contemplation of such
scenes, as must inevitably follow, finish out the
picture."
j I will now lay bofore yon an rxtract from a
published letter, addressed by Gen. Harrison, in i
ito the public, when he was a candidate lor |
Congress, in d* f.nce or his vote against the 1
Misouri Restriction.
Extract?"I am accused of being friendly to 1
j slavery. From my earliest youth to the present i
| moment, I have been the ardent friend of hn- ,
| man liberty. At the age of eighteen, 1 became
a member of an abolition society, established in
i 1 \r:?,.r ...i,:,.u

tu ameliorate the condition of slaves, and to pro. i
cure their freedom by every legal means. My i
vcuerublc friend Judge Gatch, ol Clermont conn
ty, was also a member ot that society, and has '
recently given mc a certificate that I was <>ne.? i
tlic obligations which I then caine under I have j
faithfully performed. I have been the means of j
liberating many slaves, but never placed ono in j
bondage. 1 deny that my votes in Congress in j
relation to Missouri and Arkansas, ore in this j
least incompatable with these principles. Con j
gress had no more legal and constitutional j
right to emancipate the negroes in those see- j
lions of Louisiana, without the consent of |
i the owners, than they have to free those of Ken- !
J lucky." Gen. Harrison's opinions, as expressed in j
: the above extracts, have keen frequently reiterated, !
! and, I think, we may from them fairly come to the
j conclusion, 4-liiut although opposed to slavery
j in the abstract, he regards it as strietiy a domes,
j tic question, exclusively under the control of the j
, Stales within whose limits it exists, and thai he
i would not sanction an interference with this in'
elitutiou. iu any manner whatever, by Congress,
without the con sent ot the States and Teuito. j
wmmmmammagmmmm?wm??????????
ries within whose limits it existi. In h s iats
letter to Mr. Lyons,^ be endorses what ho has
said in his Vinconnes, and olh^r speeches, and
states his friends have truly asserted that he has
done and suffered more to support Southern
rights, than any other person North of Mas an
and Dixon's line." If himself and fiiends are L
correct in this opinion, it surely should give him
a claim upon our confidence, but whether the
crown of martyrdom which they have placed
upon his head, has been justly earned, is a question
that every man must decide for nimself. I
would not strip a laurel from his brow that he
I. _ * a I l*4l ..1 * ^ . 1 .. I 11
may oe jusiiy cm new ?u, merely occause no lias j
himself asserted his claim to wear it.
As a set off to this claim made for Gen.
Hanson by certain of his Southern friends,
nnd endorsed by himself, there is conclusive
evidence to show that a couitship has been
carried on between some of his Northern
friends anJ the abolitionists, with a view of
convinceing the latter that they have mistaken
his views, and that they ought to sup.
port him. I have not time to enter into
minute detail upon this subject, but for ev.
idenceof the fact will refer you to a sketch of |
a deba;e in an abolition convention,publ'shed
in the extra Globe of the 1st of July, and
10 letters of Messrs. Mallet & Brown
published in the Extra Globe 22 1 of same
mon h, bo'.h of which I herewith enclose to
ycu together with Mr. VV. B.Calhoun's explanations
of his alleged participation inthis
billing and cooing transaction, in which
he tenders a copy of his letter to the examination,
of any gentleman or any party j
who h>?s doubts as to the correctness of his !
statements. The explanation to which 1 j
allude will be found in the National Intelligencer
of the 12. and in the Extra Globe j
of the 24ih of Juno
Having endeavored to lay before you j.
what I consider the best eviaenc in my pos- I
session as to the opinions of one of tne can- j
dates for the pressidency upon this vitally '
important subject, I will now proceed briefly ;
to consider those of the othor, so fur as j
within my knowledge they have been dovi'lopi-d
upon the same subject.
Without recurring to Mr. Van Boron's i
support of llufus King, after his opinions j
were well known upon the subject of ihe j
pro pos d restrictions of slavery iti Missouri,!
or to : is own vote in Congress to restrict ;
ihe introduction of slaves into Florida, j
when n 1822 her people applied to be or- !
ganixed, it mus' be .acknowledged that lie
lias no! placed Ins objection to an interference
with'jiliB subject of slavery in the District
olColnmbia uponihe only impregnable
barri? r of on rrights, to wit, the Constitution,
but on grounds of expediency and good faith.
Notwithstanding all this, however, Mr.
V:.I1 I'urcn's course upon this subject, since
he bus been President of the United S ates,
has b- en firm, dignified, and uncompromi 1
sing, and such as in my opinion to entitle ,
him to the confidence of die South. No
one, not even his bi'terest enemy, will now j ,
accuse hiin of being in the slightest degree (
tinctured with the fell spirit of political abolitionism.
The next subject in importance is that of ,
a 44 protective Tariff/' Mr. Van Buren j

phs of!liti Constitution in reference to u ^
protective Turdf, are much better and more j
generally understood at tins time than they
were at the enactment of these laws. So
lar as the principles of n protective Tariff i
have be? ii ohjceied to in Congress upon i.
constitutional grounds by the members j
iroin non-slaveholding States, those objeC' i
tiohs come almost exclusively from the j ,
Democratic party, and from the spirit of i
Mr. Van Buren's rn ssages to Congress, it }
can scarcely be doubted that lie has repa- j
dialed (if he ever entertained in sincerity) i
tiie ami republican opinion, that any one 1
branch of industry, .s enti led to protection ;
from the Government at ihe expense of;
0 hers.
General Harrison has been a thorough advocate
ol the protective system, but in his
letter to the citizens of Zanesville, da'ed 21
November, 133G, and wrten in explanation
01 remarks lie had made the day before,
After expressing bis conviction of the bene,
fits lint the TardFhad conferred upon the .
country, he says, "I certainly never had ,
and never coulJ have any idea of reviving ,
it. VVtiat I said was that I would dot agree

I am for supporting the compromise uct, '
und never will agree to i s being altered or

is an important difference between tlie I.
candidates for the Presidency. Air. Van
Buren's views upon this subject constitute
tlv principal grounds both of his streng h |
ai.d his weakness in this State. Tliey ure
embodied in the existing low, and form j
one of its most prominent features it is ,
well known to you, that I dessenl, to wit: (
the exclusive requirement (when the law <
shall ha\e gone iir.o full efleci) of gold an t i
silver in payment of ihe public du< s. But j |
ibis is not all, Air. Van Buren in 18,37, re- j.
commended a uniform law concerning, f
Bankruptcies of Corporations and other j?
Bankers "through whose instrumentality," ' (
he says "a salutary check might he imposed 11
upon the issues of paper money, and mi
effectual remedy given to the citizeus in a ! ^
way at once c-<|Uoi in all parts of the'Union, 1 i
and fully authorized by ihe Constitution."? ! i
Suielv the President must have forgotten
* C* m
his favorite scheme of divorcing the Government
(torn the Banks when he rccorn- J
mended tlmt the S ate Banks shoud he subjected
to Federal control under the form of j t
a Bankrupt law. In the forcible language j (
of speaker Ilnn'er in a late letter addressed j
to Iws Constituents, "bun Ireds of S;a!e!

6.mks woulJ t>e tnus placed under the favor
of the General Government, and in certain
contingencies hundreds of millior.8 of money
would be administered by Federal Agents.
What sort of divorce is that which
makes the State Banks dependent upon this
Government for their very existence, w hich
subjects ihcni to its regulation. A more
Federal or consolidating measure can
scarcely in my opinion be imagined, than to
subject Banks createdand fostered by the
States as the useful ban Imaids of industry,
to the control of Federal Agents, and in re
lation to which, let our abstract opinions be
what they may, have through a long process
of commercial prosperity become so enter,
luined with every interest in our common
country, that they cannot be suddenly abolisbed
even upon the arising of those contingencies
that have occurred more thun
once within the last few years without producing
a s' ock that must be felt throughout
the Union. For a glowing description ol
the wide spread ruin that would be occasioned
by the officers of the Frderal Gov.
eminent closing the doors of State Banks
upon the occurrences of a legal act of
Bankruptcy, and immediately winding up its
concerns, I refer you, from recollection to
a speech of Senator Calhoun upon the
Bankrupt bill, discussed during the lateses
aton m ui? ocnaie.
(To be Continued.)
ATTEMPTED REVOLUTION IN
FRANCE.
Landing of Louis Bonaparte at Boulogne.
We annex full particulars of a mad and
foolish attempt o.i the part of Louis Bonaparte
to seize the throne of France. The
folly of the atte mpt will be seen by the issue,
than which nothing couid be more silly
or ill-arranged. Enough, however, remains
to show that his citizen kingship,
Louis Philippe, has quite enough at home
to keep himself busily employed, without
set king additional sources of embarrassment
by quareling with England* ?
* A s.camer has just arrived oir the town,
and lauded about 100 men, dressed in the
uniforms of Generals and Colonels of the nr..
my. Some of tlieni went immediately to
the barracks,crytng Vive Louis Napoleon,"
and distributed money among the crowd.?
"This morning one of them, attired as a
Gen? r.d officer, and another as a Co'onel,
were arrested arid conducted to prison. A
number of horses are on board of the
steamer. All is quiet at present, and the
mi itary are ail under arms.
"The drums are beating to coll out the
National Guards. No more of the insuigents
have been arrested.
"It is said that Louis Napoleon has also
landed."
The City of Edinburgh steamer, belonging
to the Commercial S eam Navigation
Company, was hired by Prince Louis Napoleon,
ostensibly for an excursion of pleasare
along the British coast, for 14 days.? j
In this lie embarked with 56 followers, eight
liorses, and two carriages in the Thames
?*? i...,,?,i,;? mnrniinr.^abou',
I o'clock, tin y reached thecoasi of France,
dr Wimiroux, about three miles from Bouogne.
The supprise of the Captain ntid
new may beeasdy imagined to see the
ivholo of h.s passengers come on deck, not
II the peaceful garb of citizens hut in Mil'tary%
some us lancers, some as General of
ficrrs, some as private soldiers, with an oil.
skin covering on their hats, with the num.
Iter of 40 painted in front, lhat being the
regiment vhich at S:rasburg had formerly
indentified itself so seriously in the cause of
Louis Napoleon.
Their object was soon made evident.?
The ships boat was lowered, and the whole
company landt d in three trips. Before the
Prince left the vessel he order< d the captain
lo cruise offthe coas', but to keep close in
:o Boulogne, nnd have a boat ready manned
lo come off*lor th-'tn shoulJ they signalize
to that effect.
When landed, they marched into the
town shouting "Vive 1 Knipereur," the
Prince carrying his hat on I lie point of his ;
sword and wavering it in the air. 'I he soldiers,
awakened, and se?ing themselves sur.
rounded bj, General officers, knew not what
to m k" of the scene. They were, however,
soon made to comprehend that a revr>lu
ion was on foot, that Louis Philippe was
dethroned, that all France was roused in
favor of their emperor, Louis Napol< on,
.i .u .. .i .... i.
tiuu Mini uit'y in um ui in iu iiiciicu luim-wiui
upon Paris.
As some were preparing to obey, liieir
captain, who had been awakened by the
noise, rushed in among them, and restored
their wavering loyalty by shou'ing. 4*Vive
Ic Hoi." High words and a scuffle ensued
between him and Prince Louis, when the
latter draw a pistol and fired?unfortunately
the ball shattered the uuderjniv of a poor ;
soldi* r wiio was endeavoring to separate
ihcrn, and the whole party, finding that the
soldiers were lukewarm, and that the officers
were faithful, that nothing was ro be
done there, precipitately quitted the Caserne,
and retired to the port.
By this time the town was roused, the
auturittes were on foot, the drums were
beating to arms, and the National Guards
muring out in all directions. Within two
lours the greater part were ei her prisoners
n the citadel, shot, or dispersed. They
tiaile no stand after leavin^j Caserne.?
Some made their way witli tlio eagle to the
Mupoleon column, sotno with the Prmce
fastened to the sea side, and signalized for
i boat from the steamer. Unfortunately
or "them, too many got into it, and it upset. ,
Fhe Prince with three or four others swain |
or the steamer, and had a narrow escape
)f being drowned.
During their absence, however, affairs
tad changed on boar J the steamer. M.
i'ollet, the harbor-master, by order of the
Vlayor, had proceeded with a dozen Custom
house officers in a boat, and taken posses,
lion of it; it was fortunate for the Prince
hey did so, for in returning into the harbor,
hey found liitn almost exhausted, clinging

that continuing his way along the bed of the
Kedron, he came to some ancient tombd
or monuments situated on its left bank, the
most interesting of which, as it was doubt,
less the most ancient, was the pillar of Abs
iloin, the construction of which is mention,
ed 2 Samuel. 18: 18. No doubt is enter,

scribed. Its architecture is difF rent from
any tiling which he had before seen. The
bottom iscut from the solid rock. This pan
is perhaps fifteen feet in height, and is .surrounded
by an antique cornice. The second

tho distance from this to Mercury ! It is im.
possible he can be happy; he is cut of his a

the third hoie I spoke to him frankly, and said :
'Your room is very small; are you happy

room 1" 44 Yes, ceriainly ; the fact is, the half
of the world don't know the way to be happy.
I was for a while myself humbugged about
happiness ; but, sitting on my stool and reflec*
1 ting seriously one day, I got the ??N
i cr? t. I thought to be h ippy you must be rich
ii j and groat, have an inconveniently large house,
. ! more furdiiure by far than necessary, a table
1 groaning with every thing; but I soon found
| nut all that was stuff. 1 am happier here with
my lost and hammer than thousands with their
" ! tine houses and splendid equipage; and have a
' I great deal of enjoyment in looking out of my
iule cabin and laughing at the follies of the
i I world. They don't s;e, and it does them no
- h inn; anJ, between you and me, the world are
j busy pursuing more shadows. One wants to
be rich, another to get into office?never sat-*
isfied; but here am I, mending old shoes, con1
toyt.ed with my lot and situation, and happier
by far than a King. Indeed, I am thankful
that Heaven in its wrath never made tne a
King, for it's poor business."
