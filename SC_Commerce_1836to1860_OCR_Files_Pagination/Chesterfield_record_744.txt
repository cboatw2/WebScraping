"Mr. CAMPBELL, of Sooth Carolina, did <
not ties hr the purpose of diacawing tho exchequer
project, snore than awes rsaosn mended by the (
President, and now reported upon unfavorably by '
un vommuiec ax ways ana means, further than
to *ay that, it) his opinion, it was by no means the
moot preposterous proposition that has been sub.
milted to tho consideration of the American people
, since questions connected with the currency
have occupied ao much of tbeir attention. Even
if its merits could bs demonstrated, it would proba.
My have but little prospect of auooree in a Congress,
almost every member of which is pledged,
by his previous course, to some other proposition.
He had merely risen with the intention (without
entering into the discussion at length) of indicat.
ing to his constituents the course which ho should
probably hereafter pursue in connexion with sub.
jeeta of this character.
Mr. C., as his speeches sufficiently testified,
had been always favorable to a separation of the
Government funds from the uses of banks; but,
when that proposition, so correct in principle, had
been connected with another, requiring tho public
dues to be collected exclusively in specie, ho had
invariably voted against it?.believing that such a
requirement was oaleuUtcd to increase the pressure
on the commerce of the country, already almost
loo great to be home.
Since that question, however, was last agitated
in Congress, a change has occurred. Hank circulation,
witliout any oppression on the part of the
Government, has gono on gradually decreasing,
until, in many of the States, tho circulation is re
duced below the specie actually in their vaults.-? 1
Under th?v^e circumstance*, Mr. C. believed thut '
the separation of the Government funds from the *
business of trade, cvou if connected with the re- J
quirument of specie, or Government credits, exedu- 1
lively, in payment of thd public dues, would now 1
be accomplished, without prouMcing a shock upon *
Ihe commerce and industry of the country. '
He had made these remarks, not because he ex- "
jectcd, during the existence of the present Con- c
jress, to change his voto in relation to this subject; v
Tor having been clcrlcd by his constituents willi n 1
tnowledgo of his previous course, lie would scarce- 3
y fed himself at liberty to do so. But ho wished e
o indicate to them, hy the remarks lie had sub. 1
rutted, tliut in the event of being returned to tho u
lext Congress, he would, unless a change occur,
-od in our monetary affairs, probably act with the e
Democratic party on this subject, as ho had upon ^
nost others. u

Ms. Clay has been in Now Orleans for a few t
weeks on private business. Ho was received and
irr?ipa mere witu extraordinary marks or re- u
ipect. The display on hia reception was said to '
ie the most magniflcont ever made in that city. &
Committees from Mobile and Augusts have invi- >
?d him to visit these cities before his return
tome, and he is expected to do so. A public *
meeting was also held in Charleston on the 17th '
instant, for tho puqtose of manifesting their re. 1
ipect for his character and public services, and in. <
riting him to visit that city also. The Hon. '
tisNSY Middi.eton presided at the meeting, and
it was addressed by Messrs. Bryan, Pettiorl', <
Yea don and Cohen. A committoe of 26 were >
ippointcd to invite Mr. Clay to visit Charleston.
A Tetter is published in the newspapers from
Me. Buckinouam, the former traveller and lecturer <
in this country, dated Limerick, Ireland, Oct. <
1st, 1842, in which he states that although he had <
been in Ireland three months, and had travelled ?
through tho counties of Wicklow, Wexford, Kit. I
kenny, Watorford, Cork and Limerick, he had <
not seen a single drunken person. This is a part *
of the country in which drunkenness was a few , t

CONGRESS. 1
In the House of Representatives a bill passed on t
tlic 17th to repeal tha Bankrupt Act, by a vote of { f
140 to 71. Several attempts were made to mo. t

It is considered certain that the bill will pans tho 1 |

For tho army.
In the Senate, nothing or special interest is do. j
ng. Considerable time is taken up daily in re. ^
tciving petitions, und sometimes in discussing fc
them. On tlie 14th, fierce attack was made ii
jpon the independence of the Judiciary, by Mr. f
I*ArrAN, who offered a resolution proposing an
intendment to tho constitution limiting the term 0
?f Uie judges of the U, S. courts to seven years.
Flo contended that inasmuch as the people in this
:ountry are the sovereign power, the judgrs and all
>thcr officers ought to be made immediately sub. t
cct to their will. Why not then abolish all gov. 1
:rnmcnt except that of popular or Democratic as. v
temblics? This is the result to which tho Hon. v
Senator's principles lead. The resolution was, n
towever, put to sleep ; but it received tho support \ g|
?f eleven Senators, vis. Messrs. Au?v I

The Senate rcfgeed.by t rote of 17 to 99, to
wder the printing of en extra number of the report
if tlie majority end minority of the on
>he Judiciary on the subject of General Jackson's
line, it is evident that ao bill on the (object will
pass at this scesskm. The majority of the wbigs
prill not agree to pet the bill <o suoh a shape as
prill, in thsir opinion, reflect upon the motives of
fudge Hall; and General Jackson's friends will
not accept a bill which propoaca chiefly to ntiave
lira, in virtue of hie public servioes.
In the House to-day, the subject of the Ana was
liseotaed, doriaf4| morning boor, by Mr. Bat.
cr, of Ky., Who s#ln aid-de-c&tnp of General
laokaon, and who warmly advocated the inrtruc.

Mr. Kennedy, of Md., stated that the Commit.
Ce on Commerce had under consideration a bill
istablishing a warehousing system ; and offered a
evolution calling on the Secretary of the Treasury
ror information in aid of their labors.
The Reports from the Committee on Ways and
Moans ou the Exchequer were resumed; and Mr.
Underwood, of Kentucky,, spoke his hour, dwell,
ng much on the state of tho currency and the necessity
of resorting to a National Bank, as the on.
y remedy fot its disorders. Mr. U. also took a
riow of the prospects of tho Whig party. He
'.ontended that it was not dead as some had de.
slared. Those who declared it to be prostrate
vcro actuated more by their hopes and fears than
>y their convictions. As to the New York else,
ion, which had been relied on as a proof of tho
act, it proved only that tho Whigs staid away
rom the polls. There were forty thousand votes
cas than in 1840. These forty thousand did not

rite seme tiling occurred in Ohio. There the
Democratic Governor wai elected by a minority.
1'lre Whig* were kept from the poll* by the con.
Juct of the " guard" and by tbo " constitutional
act." The Whig* would learn wisdom and ex.
terience, and they would select no candidate* in
1844, whose principle* were doubtful. All tho
iisastcrd of the party grew from the election of
lohn Tyler. He wa* taken with a view to carry
:hc Stnto of Virginia, and the result was a just
udgmcnt upon the Whig party for making such a
election. He firmly believed that the Whig par.
y would be stronger in 1814 than in 18-1'J. He
toped that one party or tho other would triumph,
urn J'tat tho policy of the country would he based
in more sn?''ecl principles, and not he left to shift
villi every brcatn faction, and be subjected to

Irew it to permit an uincnduieiit to lie offered so
