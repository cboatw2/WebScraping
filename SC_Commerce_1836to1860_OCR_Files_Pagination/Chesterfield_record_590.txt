The following extract from the Far.
liter's Magazine, whilst it affords some
useful hints upon the construction of farm
buildings, also exhibits a minuteness of
attention to the economising of labor,
Hint will surorise some of our readers.?
There, it is very properly considered, that
the quantity of labor required, regulates
the cost of production, and, consequently
H that labor saved, is money made; not with- ]
standing its cheapness, in England, this
golden rule is never forgotten ; nnd the
farmer is constantly upon the alert, by
the exercise of his ingenuity to lessen his
la?o% and increase his profits:
So. Planter.
*in selecting the site of farm-offices it
is desirable to combine in the greatest
degree which circumstances admit of, the
following objects :?proximity and easy
access to a public road ; a situation central,
as regards the tillage-land, and so
as to communicate with all parts of it by !
the levellest road possible, as the inter- )
vention of a single hill that could he
avoided may make the difference between
two horses in a cart and one. A southerly
aspect; as cattle are found to thrive 1
better and to (ntten sooner, in folds open
tothesun, than in those from which his
r.ys are excluded. A command of wa-1
t? r; ao that a supply may be conveyed i
tfrough the differant parts of the build. i
irgs, and if the grounds afford it in suffi- l
miRntitv. where it can be brought I
and collected to work the thrashing ma. <
chine, and thence conveyed away, with I
little expense and without injury, or, it j i
may be, with benefit to the adjoining j
lands; where a sufficient supply of water i
cannot be had, the cheapest and best <
power is Mteani,jf coals be within a mod- I
ernte distance; water enough for that I
purpose may In; collected, if a spring is i
not at hand, from the ro^fs of the offices, i
if preserver, in u tank mule in a sliadv 1
situation and lined with clay or bricks.
If the economy of labor is to be studied j
in fixing the sire of farm buildings, it is
not less to be attended to in their con. (
struction and arrangement; they common- 1
ly form three sides of a square open to the
South ; the highest buildings being on 1
the North sides an*l those of a lower de- 1
aciption filling up the East ai d West.
The stack-yard is on the North side of ;
the square, and the harn containing the '
thrashing machine projects into it at <
# ? I* / ! I I _ L
fight angles wun me line 01 noveis wmcn <
constitute the northern side of the square i
the straw being thrown from the rakes i
into a large barn or straw.house in the 1
centre of that range, where it is piled tip
for use. It is of consequence that the I
barn he in the centre of the range, be- I
cause the straw to supply the cattle is I
carried out right and left, and only to i
half the distance which much of it I
would require to be carried if the barn i
stood in any other situation; the same I
reason holds with regard to corn which <
is being thrashed and intended to he laid j
up in granaries : grain keeps much better
in granaries that are over open hovels, i
than those that are over close houses in ,<
which horses or cattle of any kind are i
tied up ; and by this arrangement the i
granaries are made over the hovels which I
extend from each sfde of the barn, and I
the corn is carried to them from the 1
dressing floor below, without being taken I
from under the same roof 0r the sacks i

worked from the wheel of the thrashing i
machine whether driven by water or I
steam, and conveyed on hand-barrows <
with wheels to all parts of the granaries ; ]
from which again they are loaded into j j
I ttrts through trap doors in the floor he- <
lav which the carts are placed within 1 \
tie hovels. The saving of labor attend- ;;
itlf the laving up and removing of corn I <
fhm granaries situated, as compared | w.h
others at a distance from the thrash- i
ingbarn, is very obvious. It is desirable JI
fren the same reason that the straw ham ! i
shodd stand the cross way of the thrash- '
ing tarn, and not in the same range with <

(killer the straw into the middle and not i 1
the ?id of it; in this way the straw has i
only to he carried half the length of !
the hcise instead of the whole ; and when i
twokndsof straw are in use, one for fod. 1
derand another for litter, they can be
kept quite distinct, are easily taken out
by leaving an open space between them.
Peculiar situations may very properly
render deviations from these general rules
at times right and necessary, but where
so important a consideration as the economy
of labor is involved, and that for a
long course of years, as in the erection
of an extensive and permanent act of
farm buildings, too much attention cannot
be paid to it in the arrangement to be
adopted.

SUGAR FROM CORN STALKS.
Letter addressed to Dr. J. W. Thompson,
President of the New Castle County
(Del.) Agricultural Society;
Having been requested to furnish
some account of the process for manufac- j
turingsngar from corn, I cheerfully comply
hv giving all the information on the
subject so far as 1 am at present acquninted
with it. Scarcely one year has passed
since the first idea was suggested in
relation to this peculiar plan for making
sugar; and there has not been sufficient
time for those exact experiments necessary
to satisfy the careful calculator. In
one case 1 obtained from a small piece
of ground, at the rate of 100 pounds of
sugar per acre, but other experiments
made since, have conclusively shown,
that had a different mode of planting
been adopted, the product would have
been increased tenfold. The manner of
raising the corn and making the sugar is
as follows :
The corn is planted in rows 2 1-2 feet
apart, and the stalks are left to stand in
the row 3 inches one from another; it is
then cultivated in the usual manner.?
Sometime in August, or as soon as the
stalk shows a disposition to form grain,
the ears must be taken off'; this operation
must be carefully attended to, as upon
it entirely depends success. After this
there is nothing more to do until the crop
is ready to be taken up, which will generallv
happen in September ; the stalks
are then cut up at the root, stripped ol
(heir leaves, and taken to the mill, where
the juice is pressed out between iron rollers,
in the same way usually employed i
with the sugar cane. Lime water about
the consistency of thin cream, is then
mixed with the juice, one spoonful to the
gallon ; it is left to settle one hour, and
(hen poured into boilers, which nre covered
until the liquid approaches nearly to
the boiling point, when the scum must he
taken off. It is then boiled down as rapidly
as possible, taking otT the scum as it
rises. As the juice approaches the state
r>f syrup, it is necessary to slacken the
tire to avoid burning. The boiling is
generally completed when six quarts are
reduced to one : it is then poured into
coo'ers or moulds and set aside to chrys.
talize. When this process is gone
ihrough. the sugar as to he separated from
the molnsses; and the whole operation
is finished. The process here detailed
jives the quality of sugar you see in the
samples. If required, it can he afterwards
refined as other sugar. The use
>f animal charcoal and the employment
of steam in the process of evaporation, as
is common in the manufacture of beet
sugar, would I am confident, produce
white sugar at one oj>cration.
From what is known on the subject I
fully believe that an acre of good ground
treated as above described,-will yield at
least 1000 pounds of sugar?probably
more. The value of the fodder taken
from the stalks, and of the stalks th?m- 1
selves after passing through the mill, will
be more than equivalent for the whole
expense ot cultivation and keeping
ground up. The fodder produced in this
way is much superior to that usually made
from its containing a great quantity of
sacharine matter. And the whole business
of making sugar from corn contrasts
so favorable with the manufacture from

tain the preference wherever the climate
will bring the former plant to perfection.
Some of the differences may he enumer.
ited as follows : 1st, the corn is clean and
agreeable to work with, and the beet is
not. 2d, the machinery for extracting
the juice from the beet is not only more
:ost!y, but is more liable to get out ol re)air.
3d, the beetjuice contains n much
greater proportion of foreign and injurious
matter, decomposition commences
almost immediately after it is pressed out
*nd if allowed to go on to any extent,
will entirely defeat the making of sugar.
4th, the proportion of saccharine matter
contained in equal quantities of corn and 1
beet juice, is as three to one in favor of
Ihe former?therefore the same difference
will be found in the amount of fuel necessary
in evaporation. 5th, beet sugar,
when obtained, is inferior in quality and

corn is a native of our country* perfectly
suited to the climate, a true American,
*nd is in fact, the finest plant in the
world* The author of "Arator," (Col.
Taylor, of Virginia,) used to call it our
"meal, meat and manure." We now add
sugar to the list of its valuable productions.
Respectfully yours,
WM. WEBB.
Upon this communication Mr. Pedder,
the editor of the Farmer's Cabinet, remarks?
"I am free to confess that I have never
seen sugar prepared by first process at all
equal to the samples of corn-stalk sugar
forwarded by Dr. Thomson, while the
molasses, which by the bye, contains
more than 50 cent, of sugar, is far superior
to that made from any process; indeed
I have never known beet molasses
pure enough for any purpose but distilation
or the feeding of stock, for which
last, however, it is of very great iniportance.
Mr. Webb has the merit of deciding
the question, "Cau good sugar he
made from the corn stalk?" Whether
it can be made to profit, is a second consideration,
which he will have it in his
power to determine. The simple mode
of operation which he details, would do
but little in the fabrication of sugar from
11 - 1 * - !o nnf f 1m Ipnst

difficulty in the process by well appointed
machinery, it is readily admitted that a
considerable portion of art is requisite in
the numerous stages of the fabrication of
beet sugar, to free it from impurities
found in the root. With improved apparatus
and experience in the present art of
refining, there is no question that loaf,
sugar may be made by first process from
the corn stalk.
Mr. Webb's modest and uureserved account
of the mode of manufacture will !>e
read with very great interest, for if the
corn.grower can be directed to a new
channel for the consumption of half his
crop, in the fabrication of an article of
such legitimate usefulness the gain to the
community will be of incalculable impor.
lance."
Improvsme.nl in making Candles.?The '
editor of an exchange paper says that bv
making the wicks of candles about half
the common size, and then wetting them i
thoroughly with Spirits o Turpentine and
drying them again in the sunshine before
moulding or dipping, they will last longer
and give a much clearer light, than when
made in the ordinary way.
NEW GRASS.
A.correspondent of the Albany Cultivator,
writes from Sparta, Ga.. to the editors
of that paper as follows:
"We, apparently by the merest accident,
have, in my opinion, one of the
finest and be9t grazing grasses in the
world. It is called Bermuda grass, from
t he fact of its being brought fron that IsO
O
land. A gentleman in the southern part
<Kn otnta hmmrht it from there as a
VM IIIV> OiUlw wi ..
yard grass; it found its way into the interior
of the state for that purpose; all animals
are fond of it, and it is believed to contain
as much or more nutriment than any
other grass. We are beginning to cultivate
it. It grows well on poor land, resernbles
what is called the wire grass of
this region, takes root at every joint as
that grass does, until the land becomes
covered & a thick turf formed It will grow
on the poorest worn out clay, and even,
tually reclaim it, for when the turf is once
formed, nothing is lost to the land by
washing. It has to be propagated
from the root or sprig, as it has no
seed. When once planted it remains for
all time, unless shaded or disturbed by the
plow or hoe. The grazing or treading of
stock has effect upon it after turf is well
formed, the more exposed to the sun the
greater its luxriance, and mixed with
white clover, which grows well with it;
it affords good pasture for ten months in
a year. The herbage is at all times very
thick and tender. Some have objected
to it, because of the difficulty of destroy,
ing it; but one of my neighbors has fine
cotton growing where two years since
this grass was as finely set as I ever saw
it. It will be the salvation of the worn
out lands of Georgia.
LOOK OUT FOR SCOUNDRELS.
There is no doubt from the various feats !
of rascality perpetrated in this City, with- |
in a few days past, that we have among
us a set of desperadoes " fatally bent on
on mischief." A few nights ago, the
Western Stage was robbed of two Trunks,
almost within the corporate limits of the
City, and, almost at the very same spot,
a night or two after, a valuable Trunk
was cut from the travelling Carriage of
Samuel Simpson Esq. ofNewbern. One
night, the present week, a wagoner, who
had encamped in the Baptist Grove, was
knocked down while in the act of kind,

GOVERNOR'S MESSAGE, No. 1.
Executive Department, >
Columbia, Nov. 23d, 1841. $
Fellow-Citizens of the Senate, *
and House of Representatives:
I congratulate you on the recurrence
of this occasion of assembling in the ser. '
rice of your constituents, under circumstances
as auspicious to the useful discharge
of your duties, as I trust they will J
be conducive to the harmony of your deliberations.
While, in the general health of our cit- *
izens. and the abundance of the harvest,
we have experienced the usual beneficent '
distribution of the blessings of an over- j
ruling Providence, we have not less cause j
for congratulation inMhe reviving prosperity
of out* people, from the unexampled
depression and embarrassment of the
times. Steady has credit began to regain
confidence and stability-?capital to
see(t permanent investsments-r-commerce
to pursue its accustomed channels?prop,
erty to resume a fixed and reasonnble ,
value?and the energy and enterprise of
i i i. ..'iL J :_
our poopiu iu emunrK wiui new nnu invigorated
hope, in its various employments,
and pursuits.
Not the least gratifying reflection arising
from these cheering auguries of our
condition, is derived from the consciousness
that they are results, not of any
| pampering patronage of the Government
?not of the artificial stimulants of Leg-,
islative aids or interference?but of a
wise and vigilant economy in the people,
awakened by the disastrous experience of
the past, to improve the permanent and
enduring sources of their prosperity. If
some of the lingering effects of the late
derangement in the monetary affairs of
our country are still painfully experienced,
in the reduced value of property,
?diminished as it must be from the inflated
standard of a depreciated and expanded
curiency?or in the difficulty of
discharging debts, incurred in the floodtide
of extravagant prices, and a redundant
circulation?thev nre to be regarded
* D
as the unavoidable consequences of for
mer errors and delusions, and perhaps the
surest indications of a progressive state of
convalescence nnd improvement.
Nor have we less cause to exult in the
hope, that our Government may now be
regarded as having passed in security,
through the mast trying and difficult exigencies,
that ever tried its virtue, or testedits
stability.
In theevents of a single year, the sudden
ascendency of a party, actuated by
a high-wrought enthusiasm?impelled by
the disasters of the times to seek relief in
change, and rashly imputing them to the
conduct of our Rulers?seemed to threaten
the subversion of the well-established
principles of '93 and '99, and o. the re- J

as the overthrow of the exponents,
by whom they were administered. But
a few weeks experience of power, have
as suddenly disbanded, dissipated, and resolved
this magnifcent array of party
power and organization into its distinct
and original elements. The deliberations
of the late session of Congress have dispelled
the delusions of party-zeal and fervor.
Its impincticable expedients and
distracted councils have I trust, again
gathered and assembled the Republican
portion of the nation, in the unity and
strength of one fold, and one conviction.
And if the great measure of "deliverance
and liberty," important as we still regard
it to the faithful, as well as equitable administration
of the financial affairs of the
country, has been repealed, in form and
in name, we have still the unquestionable
assurance of its final success, in the overruling
necessity resulting from the signal
failure of every other substitute or device.
Among these abortive expedients, none
was regarded with more intense and absorbing
solicitutde, than the proposition to
reestablish a National Bank. On no
occasion has the exercise of the conserva- '
tive power vested in the Federal Executive,
been received with warmer approbation
by the people of this State; or been
more wisely and fortunately interposed,
to arrest the most dangerous, and most
obnoxious, of all the premeditated viola
tions of the Constitution. Of all the
| great measures of national policy, pro;
ductive of the bitterest contention among
the great parties of this Union, and
which has always and justly been regarded
as fraught with the most powerful influences
(for good or for evil,) on our political
institutions, the establishment of a national
Bank, is certainly the most obvious
and important. If such has been the experience
of the country, in the primitive
and purer ages of the JRepublic, under
the regulations of a Bank, arising out of
the embarrassments of the first war, and
the exigencies of the last?of Cf?mparatively
limited capital, and directed by the
wisest nnd ablest officers?what were we
to anticipate from an institution organized
as the instrument of a party then in
power?operating amidst the ruins of a 1
disordered currency, and the wreck, J
weakness, and dismay, of state and local
institutions. The expiring struggles of f
the late United States Bank, to perpetu. 1
ate its existence against the fiat of the s
people, and the constituted authorities of f
the country, are recent in the reeollec- 1
tion of all ot us, and form an important 2
epoch in the history of our Government. *
Doubtful as that content roust bo admit. '
I
ted to have been, waged even as it was
against an Administration, perhaps the
most efficient and energetic that has ever
controlled the de^inies of this nation,
what were we to anticipate, when our
Ruler a themselves should have become its
allies, its party, or its pageants. In this
view, it would have changed the character
of our Government, become part of
our political institutions, and consummated
the greatest of all the deprecated evils
that could befall a country?"the union
af purse and sword, in the Federal head"
?or worse, in the hands of a Federal
party. Well may such an institution be
supposed to have had the power to regulate
the currency; but it would have
been with iron rule of despotism?restraining
all insterest, absorbing all capital,
measuring all profits, overpowering
all competition, and attracting the wealth
and prosperity of every other portion of
the Union, to the centre of its opera,
lions.
It was an honest confession, of one of
the ablest presiding officers of the late
United States Bank, before a committee
appointed by Congress to investigate its
affairs, that it was at any time within its
power to crush State and local institutions!
What an appaling fact for the
contemplation of the Sovereign States of
the Union! What a prophetic warning
*- - 1 ' ? 4.4..A. k?? All
[o me iiisiiiuiiuns cuaiicicu ?? men authority
! The institutions of the country
to be uprooted and erased at the bidding
Df a heartless, soul-less, cent, per cent,
calculating corporation! The rights of
the States, and the liberties of the people,
to be subjected to the dominion of a
sordid monied Autocracy! And yet,
such is the supremacy over law, liberty,
and the constitution, to which such an institution
would inevitably have attained.
Encroachments upon the liberties of the
people, in other times and nations, were
to be apprehended from the swords of
conquerors, and the usurpations of ambitious
rulers; but experience ha9 shown
that in our own age and country, the
strongest contests to maintain constitutional,
and even sovereign rights, have
been waged against an ambitious money
power, in all its various forms, of Bank
monopolies, and protective tariffs. <Well,
therefore, may we congratulate the country
on having escaped the ambitious
pretensions of an institution which, after
imperiously dictating the humiliating duty
to the Federal Executive, of violating
bis constitutional obligations, now threat,
ens, through the vengeance of a disappointed
party, the rash and iniquitous retribution,
of abolishing the most useful
and conservative, of all the prerogatives
;>f his department.
The revision of the duties on imports,
iustly regarded by the people of this State
with a solicitude proportioned to the burlens
which the Protective Policy has hith;rto
imposed on them, has been made, nei*
ther in that spirit of equity or of compromise,
which we had just reason to antici)ate,
from the principles and concession
)f the Act of'33. The history of the op)o.?ition
of the State, to a Tariff for proection,
can neither be obliterated or forgotten.
And the high considerations
which actuated her, in consenting to com>romise
her interests fot a term of years
o the peace and safety of the Union,
ihould be a warning, as well as an iniucement
to respect her rights, as well as
>er forbearance. While the government
s acknowledged to be disembarrassed of
lebt, and the manufacturing interest perlaps
the least oppressed and the most proslerousof
any in the Union, the renewal
ifaoolicv by indirect means, which is
- ? I 0
low universally admitted to bear unequilly
upon the productive industry of differ>nt
portions of the Union, is a most flarrant
abuse of power, as well as a most
vanton violation of faith. The living
generation, who were the witnesses of the
itruggles and pledges in the (ale contest
or her constitutional rights, have not yet
jassed away,?the monuments of the
imes have not yet perished,?the very alars
consecrated by her vows, still stand
jefore us?even her preparations for deence,
are still in readiness and requisiion?the
age, its records, and recollecions,
have- scarcely become a part of
listory, before the very burdens and op
jressions which they were intended to
esist, are renewed with a shameful infilelity,
which seeks neither pretext or jusification.
' A home valuation, cash duti?s,
and an unreasonable and exorbitant
evenue of more than thirty millions, it is
>elieved are little less onerous in amount,
>r unconstitutional in effect, than the enjrmous
forty per cent, duties which the
lovereignty of this State was so sternly
nterposed to resist. And if, upon the
>rinciple of nil protective TJuties. they are
Inctinorl \t\irtrrMSP tnnn PVlent aild cn
wmitvto which our experience of the

nost emphatically forebodes, thon it will

ias so fallen from her high eminence of
lovereignty and independence, as to admit
>V a silent acquiescence in these wrongs
ind grievances, that there is no 44 mode,
10 remedy, no measure of redress." If
ihe was sufficient then for the emergency,
ihe is doubly adequate and fortified now
n the union and strength of all her citisens,
to meet aggressions upon her rights,
some from what source they may. Nor
a it less becoming the dignity and charm
* ~ ^ i
j acterofa free State, in assuming a posiJ
tion of defence which she* is rewired to
maintain, to manifest a due and timely
regard for all the means and appHsaoee
of rendering that position, as strong and
impregnable in fact, as it is in equity, and
in argument. Disregarding all tbeone%
that so often confound the convictions of
the best and purest minds, and rasortipg
to the resources which she can to amply
command through her organized gov*
I ernment, and with which God and th#
j People haveendowed her, there can BO
! emergency arise, in which the hands and
the hearts of her citizens, would not bs invincibly
united io her defefice.
Another topic, of not less importance
io itself, or of deep moment to the citiseeo
of this State, is the act distributing tbr
proceeds of the public landaft Asa source
of revenue which it is proposed tq abstract, .
at the very instant when the Federal
Treasury is said to require to be replenished,
it would seem like wantonly seeking
a pretext to increase taxation. But
considered in any point of view, it can be
regarded in no other light than that of a
distribution of the public revenue* la
one year, during a previous administration,
the proceeds of the sales of public
lands, produced a revenue of upward of
twenty millions?a maximum to which, in
more prosperous times, it would pomibly
again attain. Its average may even now
be estimated at five millions, which, if

leaves that deficiency at least to be sup.
plied by increased duties oo imports.#
That the government can exercise the
power of taxation to raise revenue foi
distribution, is a principle I presume,
which this State is not prepared to admit
Under the operation of the varioue
preemption laws, and the frequent
reductions in the price of puhlie lands,
those very States which were the largeet
contributors* to the " Public Domain' or
whose " blood and treasure" were moet
lavishly expended to acquire it, beve at
the same time been subjected to the
greatest sacrifices, in the emigration of
their citizens, and io the diminished value
of their products, reduced by eo unequal
competition with the more abundant and
teeming resources of those near end
fertile regions, which their enterprise and
industry have been seduced and abstracted
to cultivate, to the waste and abaod*
onment of their own. It was enough to
have borne all this with patriotic devotion
to the interests of our common country;
but when it is proposed to divert the!
domain from the sacred purposes for which
it was ceded, to afford a pretext for eddi*
tional burdens and taxation on one class
of industry, to give protection and bounty
to another, it assumes a character of the
highest injustice, as well as the moet
palpable infraction of constitutional
principles.
But the most dangerous, as well ae the
most humiliating effect of this measure, in
the condition of dependency, to trhich it
reduces the States, upon the bounty am)
benefaction of the government?existing
as they would, in the relation of eubeidia**
ies upon the profits of their own estatereceiving
its charity, doled out from their
own wealth, and subdued to a state of . ^
? - - k. _* !
homage, servility, and compliance, oy
bribes, stolen and lavished from theisown
Treasury. Is it not to be regarded M
the first step to the assumption of State
debts?designed to censummate a console
elation of interests, obliterating all distinctions
of sovereignty, or pride of iodepeodence,
and tending to concentrate Empire
and Dominion over the right9 of the States,
