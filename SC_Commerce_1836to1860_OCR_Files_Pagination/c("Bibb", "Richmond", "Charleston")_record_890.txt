t”hese facts, not to impugn the motives of the pioua
and the good among oft1 transpotomac brethren,
but to show, that we hJve not only nothing to
expect from the frienzed ultra-abolitionist, whose
mad zeal forestalls his prudence, but that the intel
ligent, calm, self-styled conservative, whose pru
dence- is generally in advance of his ardor,—when
the emergency comes and the experimentum crude
evolves his true position, is found, soul and service,
in the ranks of our opponents, and that therefore
the syren note from our central organ at New
York: “ Peace, peace, when there is no peace,”
cannot command our confidence or authorize the
South to expect such concessions in the present
crisis as could alone guarantee the honor and
Bafety of the Southern Church and continue her
usefulness to the slave population. .
Although the Roman firmness of the immortal
minority who constitutionally resisted the en
croachments of lawless power, furnished no equi
vocal indications of determinate and independent
church action, and has been since hailed approv
ingly by the voice pf ministry and membership
throughout thirteen conferences, yet these devel
opements have been strangely inoperative;—but
the rubicon is'passed, and the North and East feel
themselves committed to the issues of the cam
paign. Disappointed and foiled, though they have
been, in the accomplishment of their object, and
with inevitable consequences now before them
which they had fondly hoped to avert by the inter
posed agency of a few master Spirits, who were ‘‘to
ride upon the whirlwind and direct the storm —
bridle the rebellious elements, and bring in the
spirit-broken and subdued South, to swell the list
of their herculean achievements,—still they can
not—will not consent to abandon the position which
they have taken before the world, and frankly to
disclaim all pretensions to authoritative action
upon the great question involved. Nor is the
long-sought control Which they have recently been
permitted to exert over the counsels of the highest
deliberative body known to our church organiza
tion, favorable to the hope of such voluntary relin
quishments as could alone secure continued union.
None of the several propositions which have yet
met the eye of the writer, however commendable
the honest and affectionate spirit of compromise,
in which they have been submitted, distantly
promisee (as he conceives) to either North, or
South, a common rallying point satisfactory to
either, upon which a harmonious adjustment of the
difficulty in question, could be effected,—indeed,
the divellent force of abolition caloric, seems com
pletely to have overcome the strength of those
quiescent affinities which have so long maintained
the integrity, of the whole mass, and to have
thrown its elements beyond the sphere of their
mutual attraction. A new combination must,
therefore, be attempted, as best we may be able to
effect it, promising more stability and freedom
from disturbing causes.
The Southern portion ol the cliurcn mu not,—
and, safely and conscientously, cannot relinquish
her hold upon the. great constitutional principles
on which she has rested the issues of this painful
controversy. The first decision of her faithful
representatives, calmly, deliberately, and prayer
fully made, in the midst of acknowledged peril,
and the notes of remonstrance and alarm sounded
unsparingly around them, with a firmness and
unanimity, unparalleled in the history of church
legislation in modern years, was the result of the
clear, sound, solemn conclusions of enlightened
piety, when her rights, long threatened, were pal
pably and vitally infringed;—her innocent and
devoted ministry disfranchised of their official
prerogatives, and without charge of moral delin
quency, or formal arraignment,—an extra-judicial
and summary process employed to degrade the
highest officer known to her economy. These
judicious and appropriate views, have been since
corroborated and confirmed by the voice of the
whole South, and the very doctrines attempted to
be enforced by the dominant majority of the Gen
eral Conference, have so aroused the long slumber
ing jealousies of the larger portion of Southern
planters, that the great missionary field heretofore
opened for the salvation of the negro, and still
copfidently entrusted to the supervision of our
ministry, would, by an unwarrantable and igno
minious concession, of what, in our opinion neither
justice nor conscience demands, close up forever,
all access to that ignorant, but numerous and
* interesting race. A. Means.
Augusta, Feb. 15<h, 1845.
FOREIOir RELIGIOUS ITEMS
A Fanatic and his Followers.—A letter
from Paris says:—“You have doubtless heard of
the Sclavonian prophet, Towiausky, whose mysti
cal fancies and questionable auguries have involved
him more than once with the tribunals of justice.
Another of his doctrines has just been revealed by
a professor of the French college, which deifies
Napoleon, supposing him to preside, as a mysteri
ous spirit, over the destinies of man. Towiausky
has till now inhabited Switzerland, where he made
a daily pilgrimage to tho tomb of the great Kosci
usko, and wheje he was surrounded by a crowd of
disciples. He has now just left that country for
Belgiuiil, where he is followed by his absurd, but
unhappy proselytes. He has some in Paris much
wiser; they followed him, but in imagination
alone. Our 'France of 1830,’ who stirred up the
Poles to revolt, alas! now only affords them in
adversity barren sympathy.”
Great Missionary Success.—The Religious
Herald, published in the Burmese language by the
American missionaries, contains an account of the
conversion to Christianity of about two thousand
Karens, in the province of Arrakau, the result of
the missionary labors of the Rev. Mr. Abbot, within
‘ less than a year past. Truly, on such a subject as
this, the friends of Christian missions may well
rejoice, and derive from it encouragement to per
severing exertions. Mention is also made of the
benevolent gift of a thousand rupees by Major
Broadfoot to the missionaries atTavoy and Mergui,
with a view to commence the good work of educa
tion and the propagation of truth among the miser
able inhabitants of the Belong islands, on the coast
of Mergui. . >
The - Jesuits.—A letter from Vienna of the
■ • - <5 * •»
11th inst, stales that the Jesuita were making
constant progress in the Austrian territories.
Their order had been established with great pomp
and solemnity at Venice, in addition to the Jesuits'
seminaries at Lemberg, Tannopol, Monsbruck,
Gratz, and Linz. The same letter complains of
the creation of so many new. nobles, inasmuch as
ltttle store as may be set upon nobility at Vienna,
this rank confers upon numerous individuals privi
leges, especially in matters of jurisdiction, and in
the conscription, which prove detrimental to the
bourgeois and middling classes.
Dr. Kali.by.—This intrepid soldier of the cross,
who has been illegally imprisoned one hundred
and seventy days in Madeira, for preaching the
gospel, has been offered $4,000 if he would leave
Madeira; but he has declined the offer, refusing
to sell the right of speech, and of disseminating
the word of Qod, for gold. He yet preaches pub
licly, and exposes the errors of popery without
fear, because the charter tolerates every form of
worship in private, and within the confines of
dissenting churches, erected within the Portu
guese dominions, though the Roman Catholic
Religion is the established religion of the state.
The Bible CoNDEMNED.-~The Bible is con
demned in Turkey, not by the Turks, but by the
Greek Patriarch, who has come out against it.
He addresses a document to the bishops, command
ing them most carefully to see that within their
diocese there be neither bought nor sold, nor read,
by the Christians under their charge, anti-reli
gious, anti-government books, such as entirely cor
rupt the Christian people in politics, religion, and
morals, "commanding them” unchangeably to
persevere in such watchfulness, and take good
heed that this Qld Testament, recently published,
be neither bought, nor read, nor sold in their dio.
cese, nor any kind of anti-religious, anti-Govern
ment book.
The Huguenots slandered.—The Paris Tract
Society, whose receipts the past year were about
25,600 francs, ($5,000) its expenditures 32,000,
and its circulation 600,000 copies, has published
several tracts in the language of Low Brittany, a
part of France where the impostures of the Romish
priests surpass all' bounds. They have actually
distributed around them portions of the New Tes
tament, in which the word Gentile is translated
Huguenot, so that the poor people think that it
was the Huguenots, that is to say the Protestants,
who crucified our Lord !
Cast Iron Stereotype.—Experiments under
the superintendance of Herr Dasse, inspector of
mines at Ribalaud, in the Duchy of Brunswick,
with a view to make cast-iron, as the cheaper and
more durable material, applicable to the prepara
tion of stereotype plates, have resulted in the pub
lication of a cast-iron stereotype edition of the Bi
ble, published at Nordhausen, the price of which
with marginal readings, is 9 ggr. or 26 cents.
Money Tables.—The London Standard says,
It has been calculated that the Romish clergy in
Ireland receive annually for confessions, $1,350,
000; for christenings, $150,000; for unctions and
burials $270,000 ; for marriages, $1,350,000; fdr
prayers for purgatory, $450,000; for collections
at chapels, $2,410,000; for curate collections,
$101,000; for Government grant to Maynooth
college, $45,000: Total, $6,135,550.
Houses of Worship in the Free Ports of
China.—The Puritan says that the treaty nego
tiated by Mr. Cushing with China, secures to
Americans the privilege of erecting hospitals and
temples of worship at each of the five free ports,
an indulgence never before allowed to foreigners,
and a most honorable expression from the Chinese
in favor of our missions.
Ireland.—Bible readers and Home Mission
aries, it is stated in the religious Journals, are
labouring with animating success in Ireland. It
is less than ten years since the first effort was I
made there to teach the Bible in schools; 400
schools came into the plan, and 342 teachers were
employed the last year. It is estimated that
16,547 children have thus learned to read the
Scriptures.
Death of Fellenberg.—Letters from Berne
mention the death of the celebrated Fellenberg,
at Hofwyl, on the 21st ult. Emanuel von Fellen
berg was born in 1771, of a patrician family of
Berne. He was educated at Tubingen for the
bar, but later took to the profession of teaching.
He was professor to Pfeffel, near Colmar. He
founded his agricultural school at Hofwyl in 1801.
Munity among Nuns.—In the convent of Var
atan, Germany, the nuns to the number of 1,100
have refused obedience to the new superior placed
over them,—the Princess Breakovaz,—because
she has expressed her determination to make a re
form in their conduct, which she considered too
free. The rebellious ladies proceeded so far as to
break all the windows in the convent.
GENERAL, INTELLIGENCE.
FOREIGN.
Mexican Revolution.—'The intelligence which we
laid before our readers yesterday of the overthrow of
Santa Anna, of his capture and confinement, puts a
period to the stirring interest of news from Mexico.
The revolution having been completely established, it
only remains for us to gather such items of news con
nected with recent events as were unavoidably over
looked yesterday, in consequence of the late hour at
which we received our letters and papers.
The capture of the ex-President was effected by a
detachment from the volunteers of Jico, under command
of D. Amado Rodriguez, on the evening of the 15th of
January. According to the official report, he surrender
ed himself with alacrity and yet with dignity. He de
manded to be escorted to his hacienda at Encero, there to
await passports which he alleged he expected, to ena
ble him to leave the country. Our files from Mexico
and Vera Cruz say nothing of the manner of his cap
ture, save what we have just stated ; the account we
gave yesterday that he was discovered by Indians
through the sagacity of their dogs, was on verbal au
thority!; we find no mention of it in the papers—the
omission is not, however, proof of its inaecuracy. 'Im
mediately upon his capture he addressed a letter to
Gen. Rincon, through Glen. Guzman, requesting that
his person might be respected and himself spared from
the insults of his enemies. His demands were complied
with, and under an escort of five hundred men he enter
ed Jalapa in the evening, that hour being selected to
avoid any demonstration of popular feeling which his
presence might have provoked. He was subsequently
transferred to Perote, and the orders were positive that
he should be strictly guarded, but at the same time treat
ed with the consideration due to a distinguished soldier
in misfortue, and allowed every indulgence compatible
with bis personal safety. i
"V ■ •
On the 17th of January, the two Chambers of Con
gress were assembled in their capacity of “Grand Ju
rors,* and the capture of Santa Anna announced to
them by Senor Cuevas, the Minister of Foreign Affairs,
in nn address marked by great temperance and dignity
The reply of Senor Rosa, who presided over the Cham
bers, was in the samo spirit. There is nothing said of
vengence by either of them ; they recommended that the
passions which wero naturally excited by the resistance
of a general at the head of numerous forces, should be
allowed to subside now that the same general is a pri
soner at their mercy. The editors, too, of the capital
write in the same strain ; they manifest no eagerness for
the condemnation of the prisoner, and deprecate any
hasto in his trial, or any violence unworthy the justice
and maganimity of the Mexican nation. The papers of
Vera Cruz show a disposition widely different from
this, and call violently for th? blood of the tyrant. The
latest dates from the capital do not| indicate distinctly
whether he has yet been ordered thither to take his trial.
We might furnish further details of the gallant resistance
made by Gen. Inclan to the repeated assaults of Santa
Anna upon Puebla, but now that the issue is known
they would be devoid of interest.
Santa Anna, prior to his capture had renounced the
Presidency and thrown up the command of the army,
which he devolved upon Senor Sierra Rosso. Gen.
Bravo had received the orders of the President to remove
from their commands a number of the officers who had
adhered to Santa Anna and to fill their places. These
were to undergo trials. The soldiers composing bis ar
my were daily arriving at the eapital in small parties.
Gen. Alvarez left Mexico on the 20th of January forlhe
Southern Department, fully empowered by the Govern
ment to take measures for their entire and permanent
pacification.
Gen. Valencia, having vacated his command of the
troops of the capital, has been selected by Gen. Herrera,
from the three names presented te him by the Council of
Government, as the President of the Council.
Now that the contest with Santa Anna is over, the
Government is turning its attention to the incursions of
the Indians in the Northern Departments. Nothing can
be more deplorable,, according to the representations
before us, than the state of things in Durango and the
Northern part of the Department of Zacatecas. Duran
go has absolutely been overrun by the savages. Bodies
of several hundreds have encamped at one time, and for
several days in this Department, robbing, murdering
and carrying into captivity the women and children
with perfect impunity. Senor Cuevas, on the 16th ult.,
addressed the Governors of this department, and of Chi
huahua, Zacatecas, Coahuila and New Mexico, to as
sure them that a large body of troops, amply supplied
with the munitions of war, should march promptly to
their defence, and put an end to the outrages from which
they have suffered so much.
The trial of ex-President Canalizo and of Basedre,
ex-Secrctary of War, are brought to a stand, apparent
ly from the want of public prosecutors. The organiza
tion of tfie Court fcjr the trial of such cases is said to be
altogether faulty, and the editors call the earnest atten
tion of the Government and people to a radical reforma
tion in this particular.
A force of three hundred men arrived at Vera Cruz
on the 15th alt. from Cumpeachy, to assist in resisting
the escape of Santa Anna. Their aid was not needed,
as it turned out.
The Minister of War, Garcia Condc, had entered
with great energy upon a reform in the administration
of his department. Abuses, the most enormous, especial
ly in its fiscal arrangement, are said to have existed.
The press is loud in its commendation of his prompt and
vigorous measures.
Evidence has been taken in regard to the robbery of
the mint ofGuanajato. It appears to have been perpe
trated by Sierra y Rosso, by direction of Santa Anna,
the assertion of the latter to the contrary notwithstand
ihg.
Kesolutions have already been entertained in Con
gress for conferring honors upon General Ignacio Inclan,
for his very gallant defence of the city of Puebla. This
General’s address to his troops, after the forces of Santa
Anna had given in their adherence to the Government, is
full of generous tribute to the gallantry of his associates'
in command, and the devotion of citizens and soldiers
to the cause of their country.
Official notice was given on the 14th to all foreign
residents in the country, thattbey must during the month
renew their “ letters of security” or passports, under
pain of fine or imprisonment; and the authorities were
charged to see the laws of November, 1842 and ’43, in
this regard, strictly enforced.
Gen. Cortazar has voluntarily relinquished the com
mand of the Department ofGuanajuato, conferred upon
him by the Government. He pleads his infirmities and
the desire to attend to his private affairs, but declares
his readiness at all times to take up arms for his coun
try, when her independence shall be menaced, against
any foreign nation.
Gen. Herrera has exercised his power to grant par
dons in favor of several officers and soldiers condemned
to death by former councils of war. •
Our files of Mexican papers are so voluminous, that
we find that we have exceeded the limits which we had
assigned for ourselves, without at all exhausting them.
Another day we may recur to some topics which appear
to us to be of interest in the United*States.
Later from Mexico.—By the arrival at Havana
on Wednesday last of the British steam ship Tay,
Capt. Sharp, dates to the 3lst ult., from Vera Cruz
have been received.
Santa Anna still remained a prisoner at the Castle of
Perote—thesamecold,dreamy and dismal place in which
he so long held the unfortunate Texians in captivity. It
is stated that the Grand Jury appointed to try the fallen
tyrant, was furions against him, while the present
Executive of Mexico manifested a feeling of clemency
and at the same time of regret that he did not escape out
of the country and thus save the government further
trouble. A letter dated Vera Cruz, January 3lst, ex
presses the belief that the life of the tyrant would not be
taken. His young wife was in prison with him, as
was also an old friend of his, Senor Lazsro Villamil.
Among the passengers by the Tay was Senor Anto
nio Haro, Santa Anna's former Minister of Finance,
who had made out to reach the coast in safety from
Mexico. One of the editors of this paper, who came
passenger in the Alabama, was informed at Havana
that Senor H. had. escaped through the assistance of the
English Consul at Vera Cruz, and that he came on
board the Tay under an assumed name. Rejon was
still at large and his whereabouts not known.
Everything was said to be quiet in Mexico. It was
reported that the Republic was to be divided into three
military departments, Arista to have command of the
Northern, Paredes of the Centre, and some other general
of the Southern section.
An extra of the Diano de la Manna of Havana,
issued on the evening of the 5th instant, contains a
synopsis of the intelligence brought by the Tay. The
principal part of the news has already been published in
this city: we give the substance of a more important
item, whieh appears in El Siglo Diez y Nueve of Mex
ico of the34th ult.,and which is as follows:—Santa
Anna has sent, from Perote, a new communication to
the Chambers, requesting that the passport for which
he had already asked might be granted him, in which
case he would banish himself perpetually from the
country. He also stated that he would appoint an
agent fully empowered and qualified to respond to any
charges or claims made against him, leaving his landed
estate and property as a guaranty for the satisfaction
of all, and moreover speaks of the responsibilty of his
Ministers. This communication the Grand Jury were
acting upon in secret session pn the night of the 23d ult.,
and the result of their deliberations was not known.—

DOMESTIC.
Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.—Governor McDow
... «?£* -is.,. ^ .4
eix, of Virginia, baa sent a message (p the Legislature,
recommending the passage of a law to permit the Bal
timore and Ohio Railroad Company to take their road
through Virginia to Parkersburgh. The Governor
warmly presses the measure. The Baltimore American,’
in publishing the Message, says:
The Message of Gov. McDowell, takes the proper
view of the case. Virginia, if she refuses the use of her
territory to the road, will only deprive herself of a bene
fit. Her refusal will not prevent thd completion of the
road to the Ohio River,—There are other routes besides
the projected one through Virginia ; and efforts of the
most earnest kind are now on foot to induce the Compa
ny to go direct to Pittsburgh. Efficient means no doubt
would be soon forthcoming if the Pittsburgh and Penn
sylvania interest should bo brought to bear upon this
project. The Company, however, are desirous of hav
ing tbe choice of the most eligible route.
Randolph Manufacturing Company.—The Grecns
borough Patriot says:—This establishment is situated
in the handsome village of Frnnklinsville, on Deep
river, in Randolph county. It has done a flourishing
business the past year. We are informed that the
Company divided 15 per cent, and left 6 percent, for
contingencies. They use 700 pounds of raw cotton per
day, and make, in the weaving department, 700 yards
of the cloth per day. The operatives are all white, and
sustain a moral character equal to that of any portion
of the surrounding population. The eapital of the
Company is $35,000.
Cedar Falls Factory, on the river two or three miles
above Franklinsville, under the immediate superintend
ence of its proprietor, H. B. Elliott, Esq., is likewise
doing a good business.
Episcopal Church Mission in the Diocese op Mis
souri.—One hundred acres of land have been presented
to Bishop Hawkcs for a Church Mission in Missouri.
The tract is the gift of one of the descendents of the late
Gen. Clarke, and is in Montgomery county, on the
banks of the Missouri, one hundred miles above its
mouth. The Bishop, it is stated, designs to unite the
itinerating, home and educational systems in this enter
prise, which he hopes to enter on in the spring.
Case of Bishop Onderdonx.—The Standing Com
mittee of the New York Diocese, Chief Justice Jones,
Murray Hoffman, and Gulian C. Verplanck, have pub
lished a report on the case, giving it as their opinion that
the Rev. B. T. Onderdonk is still a Bishop—that be has
not been degraded or deposed from his Diocese or order,
and that the Standing Committee of New York, under
the suspension, has become the regularly constituted ec
clesiastical authority of the Diocese.
An Illuminated Bible.—We were strolling down
the Third Muncipality about dusk, says the New Or
leans Republican, when we were attracted by a bright
light through the windows of a low hovel. On approach
ing, we found a poor Dutch woman reading a sixty cent
bible by the light of a pine knot fire. Here, thought we,
is a bible more luminously shining on the track towards
Heaven than any other illuminated Bible ever seen—
Harper’s not excepted. .
Married for a Joke.—A bill has passed the Senate
of Missouri declaring the marriage of Congrave Warner
and Elizabeth Crocket null and void. The parties
were at a wedding, and upon a banter given, probably
by the gentleman, they mounted their horses and rode to
a justice’s, where the ceremony wus performed. Upon
their return, and ever afterward, the lady insisted that it
was all a joke, and refused,lo consider it otherwise.
The gentleman desired to stand up to the joke, but the
lady would not.
Vignoles Carpet Tapestry—Another Applica
tion op India Rubber.—This tapestry is made on the
principle of the ancient Mosaics, and without either
painting or colouring, all the effect is produced by
worsted thread, about one eighth of an inch long ; stand
ing veitically one end is seer, the other is cemented by
India rubber to a cloth. The Lon. Mag. of Science re
marks that from the facility of reproduction, this fabric
is likely to come into general use for carpets, nigs, cur
tains, tables, and chair covers, &c.
r Whales.—We are informed by Capt. Lavender, of
the schooner Abstract, arrived here yesterday from
Baltimore, that bn Saturday evening, off the Rappa
hannock, he saw a large hump backed Whale, bound up
the river. We learn also from other captains that two
were seen offNcwports News on Sunday and Monday
last. Their appearance is somewhat unusual in these
waters. The one seen by Capt. L., he supposes
would yield about 40 barrel's of oil.—Norfolk Beacon
U/A inst.
Ice in James River.—The Richmond Whig of Fri
day, says, James River froze over Wednesday night
below Mayo’s Bridge, a circumstance that has not hap
pened (in one night,) since the night of the 29th Februa
ry, 1836, and from tradition only once before, since
records have been kept of such events, viz: in the winter
of 1781, the winter after the surrender of Cornwallis,
when it froze in one night so hard that loaded waggons j
drove over the next morning at Court’s Ferry.
The Rev. Doctor Dcrbin and Puseyi$m.—The
Churchman of this morning has copied the Rev. Dr.
Durbin’s account of his visit to the monks of St. Bernard,
with the following remarks“ We give this extract as
evidence of‘tendencies’existing elsewhere that in our
own Church, andean safely say that no Protestant Epis
pocal clergyman would go quite to such lengths as the
Methodist president in expressing his admiration of
monks and monkery.’’— Com. Adv.
No Bible—No School Money.—The question
whether any school from which the Bible is excluded, is
entitled, under the existing law, to receive a share of
the public money, is now put in the way of being judi
ciously settled, both Boards of the Common Council
having passed a resolution directing the Comptroller
not to pay money to any school in which the Bible is
prohibited, or from which it is excluded.—[Journal of
Commerce.
The Ice Business in Boston.—We learn from the
Boston Shipping List that Jhe export of ice from thut
port, for the past month has been as follows:—To Bom
bay, 680 tons; Calcutta, 325 ; Kingston, Jamaica, 500;
Gibraltar, 25 ; Demarara, 50; Guadaloupe, 87; New
Orleans, 2904 ; Mobile, 690 ; Pensacola, 150: Savannah,
300; Charleston 738. Total, for January, 6349. Total
for eight months, 21,852 tons.
Choctaws.—Some three or four hundred ofthese In
dians are now encamped on the Big Black, about eight
or ten miles from Cauton, Miss. They are waiting the
arrival of the rest of the tribe to proceed to their new
homes beyond the Mississippi. Messrs. Forrester of
Mississippi, and Anderson, of Tennessee, have the
contract for their removal.
A Falling Off.—In an official document, read in the
Louisiana Convention, it was set forth that in 1840 the
number of slaves in New Orleans was 22,448, while in
1844 it was but 8963. This seems to be a most rapid
falling off in the numerical strength of the slave popula
tion.
New Work op Prescott.—Mr. Prescott has in pre
paration the Conquest of Peru—a rich subject for his
genius; for although some of the events bear a general
resemblance to those which occurred in Mexico, there
are abundance of others entirely unique.
New University.—A State University is to be estab
lished in the villuge of Oxford, Mississippi, $95,000
have been collected and credited to the seminary fund,
and it is expected that the sum will be increased to $166
J00.
