^ The description given of Jerusalem and the Holy
' Land is graphic and entertaining in the highest de
gree. Notwithstanding ,Dr. O.’s health continued
exceedingly delicate,—confined to hie room for
several days while in Jerusalem,—such was his
anxioty to survey this spot, that as soon as he could
leave his chamber, we find him in Gethseiqane, on
r Calvary and Mount Zion. And that part of these
volhmes which is devoted to Jerusalem and its en
virons, will be read, especially by every lover of
Christianity, with captivating interest ,

salem will not be forgotten! The banner of the
■ Cross shall wave in holy triumph even there. Yes j
; in ,that city where Jehovah revealed hisglory to the
holy prophets from the Mercy Seat,—where the an
nouncement of Salvation fell from the lips of Jesus
. himself,—where he was crucified,—buried,—rose
from the dead,—ascended to heaven,—where the
apostles received their broad commission to preach
. Jesus and the resurrection to all the world, even
here shall the Saviour’s name be proclaimed again,
as the only means of human salvation. Syria and
all the East is properly missionary ground. The
. people are generally poor and deplorably ignorant.
What do they know of the means of salvation!—
Justification by faith in Christ, and holiness of heart
as a condition of entrance into heaven, make no
part of their credenda. Shall they live in dark
ness, and die in despair! Never! As Jerusalem
. kindled and flung out her beacon fires to show Wes
tern Empires the way to glory* let these now, in
return, send back the light of truth into the darkest
dens of Mohammedan ignorance, and show those
wanderers the way to their “ father’s house.” But
how shall this be done! In answering this ques
tion, the different branches of the Church would
do‘well to consult “ Dr. Olin’sTraveis in the East.”
The observations which he makes on this subject,
will be found invaluable. But I must close this
article, already too long, by saying, that so far as
l am capable of judging, in this book-making age,
. and amongst the valuable works now before the
public, the one brought to view in this article, of its
kind, if it does not surpass, is quite equal to any, in
the beauty of its style, the strength and conclu
siveness of its arguments, and the lively interest
Which every page is calculated to excite in the bo
som of the reader.

For tha Southern Christian Advocate.
■' AIKEN.
How grateful to the feelings of the Christian
minister is it to record the goodness of God to the
church in which he labours;—to be able to tell of
souls growing in grace,—established in the faith,—
groaning after all the fullness of God in Christ;—
of souls united in love, where peace prevails. How
delightful it is to see the young and middle-aged,
tearing away from earth’s allurements, entering the
church,—taking up the cross, to follow the Saviour,
whithersoever he may lead;—to see the young
man who is rejoicing with his bride, come forward
to the altar, and there, with her he loves, promise
for God to live and die. All this, bless God, we
have seen. Many who were once opposed to our
church arc now her warmest sons and daughters;
and of CO or 70 who have joined during the last
eight or ten months, but one has hoen dropped.
Thus has the name of God been glorified by the
pious walk and godly conversation of these his re- ]
deemed. Our stewards and leaders are men of the j
right stamp, living up to, and loving our Discipline.
Truly God has been favourable to our Zion in this
place ; he has watered from above the seed sown,
and it has yielded an hundred fold.
The Sunday school cause prospers here,—free
from all sectarian divisions. Teachers and chil
dren from each congregation, with a good Presby
terian at the head, meet together, the one to impart,
the other to receive instruction that maketli wise !
unto salvation. Its anniversary has just been cele
brated at our church, and the congregation gave evi
dence that the citizens in general were its patrons.
Peace be to those engaged in the good cause, and
unto Him who has done all things well, be glory for
ever. R. J. L.
July 17,1843.
To the Editor of the Southern Christian Advocate:
Dear Sir,—Suffer me through the medium of the
“ Christian Advocate,” to correct an unfounded re
port, which may have obtained credence with some
of my Methodist brethren in Georgia,—that I in
tended to withdraw myself from the brotherhood
and communion of the Methodist E. Church,
which I had the good fortune to join in the year
1839, at Louisville, in this state, under a firm con
viction of the necessity of a spiritual change. I
think and feel now as I then thought and felt on
the all-important subject of religion; and give me
leave to say, that I have a stronger and higher con
fidence in the Methodist Church,—in the purity
and truth of its doctrines,—and in its capability to
afford the means of salvation,—than I could possi
bly have in any other church on the face of the
globe. And if, from professional labours, I cannot
commune with my brethren as often as my heart
wishes, yet, let them rest assured, that I am always
with them in sentiment and feeling.
Trusting this may serve to correct any erroneous
impression that may have gone abroad in reference
to my supposed dissatisfaction, I remain, very re
spectfully, your friend and brother,
Cutler W. Young.
Paris, Scriven Co., Ga., July 22,1843.
GENERAL INTELLIGENCE.
FOREIGN.
From Wilmcr and Smith’s European Times, July 4.
Arrival of the Caledonia.—Fourteen days
later from Europe.—The intelligence which this
packet carries out possesses no striking feature.
Theriots in Wales, which have been suppressed,
and the agitation which still prevails in Ireland, are
amongst the moBt striking events of domestic inter
est. The rates exacted from toll-gates, combined
with a thorough hatred of the new Poor Law, and
the absence of work, produced by the depressed
condition of the iron trade, are the causes which
have mainly contributed to the recent disturbances
iu South Wales.
Mr. O’Connell continues his triumphant course of
agitation in the sister kingdom, in which he is pow
erfully assisted by the priests. The rent comes
pouring in by thousands weekly, and he is almost
daily engaged in addressing hundreds of thousands
of his countrymen in various parts of the kingdom.
But the movement,—owing, probably, to the people
on this side of the Irish Channel becoming more
familiar with it,—excites less attention, or, rather,
less alarm, and it forms a less prominent topic than
hitherto in the journals. Attention is now chiefly
directed to tracing tho complicated social maladies
under which the country labours, and various an
the remedies proposed. The Government, it is
clear, proposed to do nothing, either id the way of
coercion or amelioration. All they seem to have
provided for, is the suppression, should it occur,—of
Which there seems at present little probability, of a
revolt Mr. O’Connell still preaches peace and
subjeotion to the laws, coupled with the assurance
that if the constitution Is stretched to crush the ag
itation, he will oppose it by force. The condition of
Ireland is kept before the public by the nightly
discussions in the House of Cornmons on the Irish
Arms Bill,—a measure which is denounced in
emphatic terms by the Irish members as. being
unjust and tyrannical, and which, because of its
greater stringency than was their own when in
power, is opposed by the Whigs. The Bill, in con
sequence, makes little progress in committee, dis
cussions beingraised by its opponents in every stage,
in order to kill time and wear out the session. This
Irish agitation is the most formidable barrier against
which the existing Government has run its head.
Sir Robert Peel is placed between cross fires,
exposed to the sneers of the opposition for the want
of moral courage to do what he believes to be just to
the country; and strongly censured by his adher
ents for refusing to put down the clamor by force.
Some attention has been bestowed upon the Repeal
meetings recently held in various parts of the Union,
the accounts of which came to hand by the Acadia
on Wednesday. O’Connell will tell the parties who
have stirred in this movement on the other side of
the Atlantic, that the best service they can render
him is the transmission of their dollars. The Re
publican party in France hold the same language on
the subject of Ireland to which expression has been
given in the United States. The Government it is
clear, will have to buy off the agitation by reducing
that unseemly anomaly, the Irish Church, within its
legitimate dimensions, by quartering upon the Ex
chequer, or otherwise elevating the social position
of the Catholic priesthood, and by the introduction
of practical measures for the benefit of the laity.
The Irish ask as a condition for being quiet, a high
price, which they know will never be. given,—the
Repeal of the Union; but it is more than probable
they will get half of what they want in the conces
sion of such measures as those alluded to,—which,
all things considered, would be a fair compromise.
Cotton trade.—Since the date of the annexed
Circular, we have had rather a better demand for
Cotton, although at very low prices; the sales on
Saturday were 4,000 bales, and yesterday also 4000
bales; and yesterday several large offers were re
fused which looks as if the market had seen its lowest
point To-day (Tuesday) the market opens with a
moderate demand, and the sales promise to be 2000
bs. The weather is beautiful and the crops promise
a most abundant harvest:—Liverpool4th July.
France—The French police have been actively
engaged in endeavoring to discover who are the
Frenchmen said to have passed over to Ireland to
foment discontent, and to stir up the people to resis
tance. .
Mdle. Rachel has been received at Marseilles
with the greatest enthusiasm—with honors unpre
cedented. A numerous cavalcade was waiting for
her at the gates of the city, and in the evening they
gave her a serenad#under her window.
On Friday evening, in the Chamber of Deputies,
on an amendment for reducing the army estimates
by 14,000 men and 5,300.000 francs, there appeared
to be so large a majority for ministers that the ques
tion was not put to the vote. On Saturday, how
ever, a small vote for improving the breed of caval
ry horses, proposed by Marshal Soult, was rejected.
An idea prevailed on the Bourse, on Monday,
that the termination of repeal agitation in Ireland
was at hand, as well as the Spanish insurrection,
and the funds rose accordingly.
The ministers received rather a mortifying check
in the Chamber of Deputies, all the remaining re
ductions proposed by the committee on the budget
having been adopted, notwithstanding the opposi
tion of Marshal Soult.
French Trans-Atlantic Steam Navigation—
The French Government is about to establish a reg
ular line of steam-packets from Havre de Grace and
Brest to New-York and the different West India
Islands. Four splendid steam-packets, of 200 tons
burthen and 450 horse power, have been in active
construction at La Rochelle and Brest, and will be
launched at the latter end of this month. Two of
these packets are to run regularly between Havre
de Grace and New-York, sailing on the 7th and 21st
of the month, so as not to interfere with the English
Post office mails of the 3d and 8th to Halifax and
Boston from Liverpool, and the same dates to the
West Indies, touching at the following ports:—Gua
daloupe, Martinque, St. Domingo, (Ilayti,) &c.,
whence branch packets will be established to Belize,
(Honduras,) Havana, Carthagena, Chagres, La
guyra, Puerto Cabello, Santa Martha, Cuba, Tam
pico, VeraCruz, &c., communicating with the Eng
lish packets to Antigua, Barbadoes, Berbice, Dome
rara, Dominica, Grenada, Jamaica, &c.
Spain —Spain will soon become famous for rev
olutions. She is changing her character. For a
hundred and fifty years without commotion, until
the French war; she has never been at rest since.
The cause for which she takes up arms now seems
wholly unimportant to the Spaniard. He first fought
for th"e New Constitution; then for the absolute
King; then for Riego and Jacobinism; then for
Christina and Liberalism. Don Carlos and Despo
tism then won the hearts of the whole north of
Spain, while the south remained faithful to Christina,
and the east took neither side. The war died away.
Espartero was appointed Regent, and the east burst
into insurrection. The insurgents were shot and
shelled, their leaders hanged, and their juntas put
to flight. And now,—for what reason is an incon
ceivable as any of the past,—the insurrection has
broken out again in Catalonia, and the revolutionary
junta has declared itself independent, and called
upon the kingdom to throw away the sway of the
Regent, and appoint a central junta. All this is
curiously perplexing for the time, and all will die
away. The Spaniard is too fond of his cloak and
his cigar to keep long on foot in the field. But this
disturbance must be immeasurably vexatious to
the Government, and ruinous to the country. It
almost renders legislation hopeless, and inevitably
tends to deprive Spain of all chance of a free con
stitution. Where subjects are habitual rebels sov
ereigns will be habitual tyrants. The monarch j
who lives in fear must protect himself, and the riot
of the multitude will be repaid in coercion. All
this is melancholy. The interests of a vast nation
are actually prostrated at the feet of a faction ; the
opening prospects of a country singularly gifted by
nature are obscured by the vapour of national blood,
shed in contests too obscure for history; and the
progress of knowledge is over fields of battle.
Espartero is still vigorous and vigilant; but what
can one man do in a nation where allegiance seems
to be a jest, where the populace are at once bigoted
and faithless, and where the priest at once blinds
the national eye and fills the national ear with fic
tions 1—Britannia.
Greece.—Letters from Athens of the 10th nit.
announce that the affairs of Greece had arrived at
a crisis, and that nothing but a complete change of
system could prevent the king from falling a prey
to anarchy. The king, however, appeared to perse
vere in his old plan, for although both the army and
navy were reduced to the lowest amount, his Majes
ty had elected eight major generals and two rear
admirals. Commerce throughout Greece was in a
most deplorable state.
China and India.—Since the news in our se
cond page was set in type, the depatches by the over
land mail have unexpectedly come to hand. In
Scinde, Sir Charles Napier, it is stated, has scorch
ed the snake—not killed it. Shere Mahomed, at the
date of the last accounts, was again at the head of
a prodigious army of Bcloochees, and had sent a
message to the old General, to the effect that hav
ing fought two battles for his country, he wished to
have a third for religion. Sir Charles Napier was
making every effort to comply effectively with his
request.
The following abstract of the news contains all
that is interesting:
The news from China extends to the 28th of
March. Her Majesty’s steamer Vixen, with the Sec
retary of Legation on board, had arrived on the 19th.
Some delay in the ratification of the treaty was
anticipated, in consequence of the death of Elepoo.
The Plenipotentiary had been dissuaded from pror
ceeding northward for the present, in case of missing
the new Chinese Commissioner on his way south
ward from Pekin. Everything continued quiet, and
the ill-feeling towards the English appeared to be
abating at Canton.
Nothing of any note in.the way of fighting has oc
curred siuce our last; hut another great battle was
looked for about the beginning of June. Shere MaJ
homed had managed to collect from the hills to the
westward an army of 30,000 Beloochees, with 20
f uns; these were posted in a strong position near
lyderabad, so as to cut off the communication with
Sukkar. It was understood that Sir Charles Napier
would goout to meet them so soon as reinforcements
arrived sufficient to make up for the loss of her Ma
jesty’s 22nd and the 1st Grenadiers.
The head quarter wing of the 78th Highlanders,
with the left wing of the 2nd Bombay European
Regiment, have been despatched to Kumachee,
whence her Majesty’s 28th had proceeded to Suk
kur.
There seems some reason to expect disturbances
in the Punjaub. Shere Sing has had a paralytic
stroke. Should this prove fatal to him, the Gover
nor-General will probably discover that the Kyber
mountains constitute the limits nature appears to
have assigned to us.
Bundleaund, Sangor, and the adjoining states are
still disturbed, but considerably less so than at the
date of our last. All is quiet in Kytul. The Gov
ernor-General remains at Agra for the present. In
dia in general is tranquil and contented.'
Our Constantinople advices speak of the contin
uance of hostile demonstrations on all sides, but of
no decided acts. Expectation, as to the future,
centred in the approaching arrival of Baron Lieven.
Prom Alexandria the news is important, inasmuch
as the Pacha has publicly expressed his intention of
associating in the Government his grandson Abbas,
in consequence of his own age and infirmities, and
Ibrahim’s beingan invalid. Unfortunately between
Ibrahim and Abbas there is a deadly feud, which, at
the old man’s death, may lead to civil war.
Irish Reapers.—It is extraordinary proof of the
zeal of the Irish peasantry in behalf of the Repeal
movement, and of their anxiety to attend Mr. O’Con
nell’s meetings,that scarcely any of them have come
over to the nay-making. Our streets and roads
usually swarm with them at this time of the year,
but there are actually not any to be seen this sum
mer. We suspect that these poor fellows will
find, before the year is out, that agitation is not half
so good a trade (for them at least) as hay-making.—
Liverpool'Times.
Primitive Methodists_The 24th annual con
ference on the Primitive Methodist Society closed
on the 16th inst. Their number's are as follows
85,565 members; 488 itinerant preachers; 7,438 lo
cal ditto; 1,278 chapels ; 74,450 scholars in their
Sunday schools; deaths, 934; increase for the year,
6,042; increase of Sunday scholars, 4,386.
Influenza.—Some idea may be formed of the
extent of the influenza at present in this city, from
the circumstance of the daily number of new appli
cants to the sick poor institution, Meat-street, being
increased from the usual average of forty or fifty to
above one hundred during the last week.—Dublin
Warder.
DOMESTIC.
Storm.—Phenomenon.—The storm which we
had here on Saturday afternoon last, likewise pas
sed over Philadelphia, doing considerable injury to
trees, awnings, &c. The Ledger, in speaking of it
says,—There appeared to be two distinct masses of
clouds, one from the West and the other from the
North, which appeared to come into collision almost
immediately over the city. At the time of their
junction, an oval ball .of lire, of considerable size
and of a deep orange color, was observed to descend
with great rapidity towards the earth, apparently in
the vicinity of the Navy Yard, followed by a loud
roll of thunder. The phenomenon was witnessed
by several persons in the lower part of the city.
The ball appeared to fall in Jersey, nearly opposite
the Navy Yard. We understand that a man, walk
ing along Washington street, Southwark, when
near Second, was considerably stunned by an elec
tric shock, and a chimney in the vicinity was over
thrown at the same time, either by the wind or the
electric fluid.—New- York Courier.
Dandyism.—‘What is more ridiculous to a dandy \
than a philosopher, or to a philosopher than a dandy!’
We thought of this query whiie reading a description,
in a comnymication before us, of a knot of fourth
rate dandies, the‘apes of apes,’ which the writer
encountered in the bar-room of an inn, in one of the
fourth-rate towns of Maryland. Doubtless these
artificial ‘humans’ looked upon our friends as quite
to be pitied that he was not ‘one of us I’ In their
ultra dress, affected manners, drawling tones, and
whey-faces, you might read the foolish inanity of
an existence parallel in every respect to that of Beau
Brummel, except that his was original absurdity, and
theirs was folly on loan. It was Parisianistn adulter
ated in London, qualified in Broadway, weakened in
Chesnut-street, reduced in Baltimore, and at last in
these provincial decoctions diluted to the lowest pos
sible degree of insipidity, with scarce a perceptible
tincture of the original liquid. These had no souls by
nature; and the only idea they could inspire was one
of humiliation, that apes wore permitted to wear the
likeness of God’s image.’
Something Singular.—Wisconsin and Fox
Rivers.—These rivers, near Fort Winnebago on
the Wisconsin, run parallel to each other, though in
different directions. The distance between each is
but a mile and a quarter. They are simply separated
by a plain or flat piece of ground, and what is re
markable, in high water they run into each other
and thus become united. Almost ever since the
snow melted this spring they have been thus con
nected. The flat, separating them, has been cover
ed with water to the depth of four feet,—some say
six,—the present season, or sufficient to admit a
steamboat to navigate up the Wiskonsin, across the
flat, and thus finds its way down the Fox river into
Lake Michigan at Green Bay! A canal could easi
ly be constructed, one mile and a quarter in length,
which would most effectually unite the waters of
the Mississippi with those of the Great Lakes.—Iowa
Hawk Eye.
A Heroine—A few days ago the dining room of
a boarding house at Jersey City was entered by a
robber soon after the servant had prepared the table
for dinner. The girl was absent but a short time,
and when she entered the room she observed the
fellow very actively engaged in putting the silver
spoons and other plate into his pockets. She ad
vanced toward the table, when sho was confronted
by the robber with carving knife in hand, declaring
that if she spoke he would cut her throat. By her
movements she drew him near a pantry door which
he supposed opened into the street, and made a dart
Into it, when she, with great presence of mind,
closed the door and turned the key on him, and gave
the alarm to those in the house, who immediately
came to her aid, and the fellow was captured.—
N. Y. Spectator.
The Naked Truth_Dr. Beecher in his late
discourse in the Tremont Theatre, thus alludes to
the celebrated danseusc, Fanny Ellsler :
“But beside this testimony, there is more and
worse, of which it would be a shame to speak.—
Who can describe in full the dress and motions of a
late dancer on this stage and through the land ; her
pants in such close imitation of nature as baffled
discrimination between costume andflesh—with her
short over dress, rising as she whirled round atnid
shouts of applause which might have made the Devil
blush, antifemale virtue, had it been there, burn with
indignation, and hang her head in shame!
The theatre the school of virtue ! Pandemonium
the abode of Holiness ! the theatre the mirror of
nature ! Yes, of naked, shameless revelry !’*
Emigrants.—The New York Courier says :—
“ Two Norwegian barques arrived at this port yes
terday from different ports in Norway, with 255 pas
sengers, nearly all of whom are agriculturists. It is
their intention to proceed at once from the vessel to
the two boats, and from them to the interior : and as
they have brought a considerable quantity of specie
with thorn, they cannot fail to become a valuable ac
quisition to the neighborhood near which they may
locate. The emigration from the north of Europe
will be much larger this year than usual—about
12,000 are expected from the differefit ports in Nor
way, Antwerp and Hamburg in vessels consigned,to
one house in this city. ■ "i- -y
Locusts—A writer in the Journal of Commerce
says, that the tornado of Sunday, the 2d inst., seems
to have destroyed the locusts. At Staten Island
they were taken up by the wind and carried over
the Bay, where they fell and drowned in myriads.
A resident of the Island states that the next day
there was a long black line along the beach by the
Narrows, and on examining it he found it to be the
dead locusts washed ashore by the tide. Previous to
the storm the humming noise made by the locusts
filled the whole air—and is said to have been like the
humming of the wheels of a large factory.
Pike at Sino Sing.—We learn from A. M. C.
Smith, Esq., that a serious fire was discovered break
ing out at dinner time, yesterday, from the brush
maker’s shop, in the State Prison, which seemed to
come from three or four different places at the same
moment. It soon communicated to the plane-ma
king and cooper shops, which were soon laid in ru
ins. At the time the steamboat left Sing Sing, yes
terday, at 2 o’clock, the fire was raging at an alarming
rate. The contractors for those shops have lost
about $10,000, and the State three fine brick
buildings, if not more. The excitement Was tre
mendous when the boat left.—Plebeian, 20th July.
Change of Current.—Among the arrivals at
Buffalo this week, was an invoice of eleven tons
of soap, manufactured at Lafayette, Indiana, on its
way to the East. Soap must therefore be added to
the list of articles which are no longer to be expor
ted to the West, but imported from it* The last five
years seem to have erected so many great counter
currents in the West, that it is difficult to say what
interest at the East may not be undermined. We hope
they will not find materials in their pigs out of which
to make newspapers for the Eastern markets.—Jour,
of Com.
The Cabinet.—'We are authorized to announce,
that the Cabinet arrangements have at length been
completed, and that the Departments are placed
under the administration of the undermentioned
gentlemen, Hon. Abel P.Upshur, Secretary of. State.
Hon. John C. Spencer, Secretary of the Treasury.
Hon. J. M. Porter, Secretary of War. Hon. David
Henshaw, Secretary of the Navy. Hon. Charles
A. Wickliffe, P. M. General. Hon. John Nelson,
Attorney General—Madisonian. .
Total Loss of the Ship Hanover, of Provi
dence.—On the night of the 16th June, Ship Hano
ver, of Providence, from Savannah for St. Petersburg,
struck on the rocks called the Atlas, about one mile
from the north-west point of North Ronaldshag,
Orkney Island. Vessel a total loss; about 230 bales
Cotton have been saved, and many other bales are
picked up in many places about the Island. CapL
Martin, officers and crew all saved; the latter had
left for the United States previous to June 24th.
The ship went ashore in thick foggy weather.
The Truth Shortly Expressed.—Lord Ash
burton, in a late speech, made some allusion to the
causes of hard times and the destitution of the poor,
in which occured this passage,—“ If it was possible
to ruin a country by every production, it would be
chiefly effected by raising a bloated mass of manu
facturing population, and by leaving them to starva
tion and misery when the demand for their labour
had ceased.”
Emigration to Oregon.—The Oregon emi
grants have at last started fairly on their way.
We bid them God speed on their journey.—There
is a fine lot of them that an Abraham might envy. ;
Oregon, ho—Two hundred wagons and about
one thousand persons, left their rendezvous at Elm
Grove, a few days ago, for Oregon. They had no
less than two thousand five hundred head of stock
with them !—Western Missourian,
Joe Smith.—It is easier to catch the Mormon
Prophet than to hold him. His followers rescued
him from the hands of the Missouri Philistines, and
carried him back to Nauvoo in triumph. Not only
so, hut they captured and carried off two of the
citizens of Missouri, to try them in Nauvoo for
their connexion with the abstracting of the Prophet

You will perceive that all our Camp Meetings arc ap

own church will violate the sabbath, when the meeting
closes on Monday, by sending servants, Sic., after wag
i ons, teams, horses, &c., on Sunday evening. I wish not
to be a partaker of other men’s sins.

BIOGRAPHY OF BISIJOP ROBERTS.
To Pie Ministers and Members of the Methodist Episco
pal Church.
Dear Brethren,—Permit us tocall on you to communi
cate to us as early as possible any well authenticated inci
dents or facts in the history of our late venerated Bishop
Roberts, which may (ussibly aid in preparing a sketch of
his private and public life. Letters from the hand of the
Bishop, which may possibly be used in this work, should
be promptly forwarded. Such letters shall, if desired, lie
carefidly preserved and returned. We are earnest in this
call. Do not fail to be prompt in responding to it.
Should you delay, your communications will be too late
for the use to which we would devote them. We use, for
argument to persuade you not to neglect or defer this du
ty, tho respect duo to the departed, your love of the
Church, and the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
We hope all the papers of our Church will insert this
notice twice or thrice. Whight & Swobmstedt.
