Mount Pleasant, March, 16,1841.
To Mm. : Dear Sir.?Mr. Gill
has just handed me yours of the 10th, and
I feel unspeakable pleasure in answering
yon. I am always willing and ready to
give that information necessity to the
advancement and final prosperity of the
ilk business in this country. After be.

last 40 years, in London, Economy, Pa.,
* and Mt. Pleasant, in all its various branch.
esi standings and bearings, I flatter my.
elf my remarks may be taken as facts,
founded oo a long and chequered experi.
enoe. After the pertinent and judicious
remarks made, by G. W. Gill upon silk
raising, and published in the Western
Farmer and Gardener, I should betray
weakness were I to add any thing relative
to that department. Still, as a pioneer
in the silk business, I have many opponents
to combat with, and much prejudice
to remove, that stand as barriers to its
'more extended operations. Many good
but mistaken gentleman have said to me.

Fnoce and England." I would invite
those gentlemen to come to Mt. Pleasant
and see six looms in operation on plain
aiIk, flowering silks, silk velvet, &c., dec.
From this place I would entreat them to
take a trip to George Rapp's establish,
tnent, Economy, Pa., where my son su.
perintends, and behold what an eminence
they have arrived at. Neither France
nor Eogland can surpass their machinery
01 silk fabrics. About four years back 1
put in action for them 2looms, silk velvet,
and hat plush: now they have 6 ; and 18
months back there pas not a loom in Mt.
Pleasant, and now 6. Surely this must
convince the most perverse and obstinate
mind, of the practicability of weaving up
our own raising. What has been done
here and at Economy, can be done almost
anywhere in the Union. We have lately
purchased a considerable quantity of reel*
ed silk from G-G. Stockly, Esq., Cleaveland,
Ohio; his production speaks volumes
^ of praise upon his exertions. We have
purchased considerable quantities from
various parts, but his exceeds all. For
30 years in England, I have had pass
through my hands 200 to 250 lbs of silk
weekly. (I appeal for the truth of this to

k Bengal single, to a Piedmont; and I do
not hesitate in giving the preference to
the Cleveland produce. Upon the whole,
from what we have raised ourselves and
bought of others, I am constrained to give j
the decided preference to the American
silk; and when the worms are fed upon
the Italian or Multicaulis mulberries, the
silk excels all I have seen from France,
China, Italy or Piedmont, in scent and
brilliancy. I am aware the loss of scent
er fragrance in England, may be accounted
for by the length of voyage and the
silk oftentimes exposed to the saline air :
but the brilliancy I believe is peculiar to
American alone. This ought to be a
great encouragement to those who have
commenced, to persevere, and an inducement
to others to begin, knowing ultim
ately it will be a source of wealth to this
country ; and if our state legislatures will
give ibe silk raisers their smiles and enoouragement,
and Congress will afford its
parental protection, we have nought to
fear from any foreign competitor, or competitors.
Let them try their worst, or do
their best, they never can compete with
us. I am happy to find you are about
cammeucing this season; I wish you, sir,
success and prosperity, and have no doubt
of it ; for success is sure if conducted in
a proper manner.

CATALPA POSTS.
Mt. Carmel, 111., March 8,1841.
General Harrison some years ago, fron
his residence on the Wabash, had enter
tained a high opinion of the vast impor
tance to the farmers of Ohio and Ken
an/1 nf fh? crrpnt West ircnorallv
,WV-J? O o V
growing the Catalpa or Catawba tree foi
post and rail fences: his remarks wen
published in a Cincinnatti paper. Mr
Jetferson, in his notes on Virginia, or ir
some other, published forty or fifty year
ago, states that this tree was a native o
the Wabash valley. In 1816, *17, ]
found them here; but no one, not appri
zed of the fact, would take them at firs
to be the Catalpa or Catawba tree, a
growing wild they look like the Linn.?
That the high recommendation given bj
Gen. Harrison of the timber, is correct
I shall now state, that on yesterday pas
sing the farm of Mr. Samuel Rigg, living
three miles west of this, I was shown i
post fixed for a barn, and a roof formei
and covered ever; yet the post had sho
out limbs; all hut one was cut away
? i i i- r iL. .t i. _
Wtiicn iormen a snaae iur me smciv, a
well as a post to sustain the bam ! An
other man, about three miles from Mr
Rigg, had fixed a similar post for a gate
which has grown into a free, andnotraci
of the post is left! A tree, fallen acros
a creok near Vincinnes, has formed i
bridge for the French for 70 years!?Mr
Rigg informed me that his barn post ha<
lain exposed to the weather for severa
weeks before it was planted.
Discovering that the mere posts of th<
Catalpa, Catawba, or Warhoo, as it i
as it is called, takes root, I do most seri
ously recommend to the farmers of Ohi<
and Kentucky, to secure a sufficien
number of them to plant a grove ; whei
planted close they grow well; and as th<
eccrentric old man, Joe Craig of Ken
tucky, said of the black Locust, that wil
"last forever," far he had tried it "thre
times our Wabash Warhoo will out g
his Locusts as to durability ; for we hav
fouud logs, which from appearance ha
reposed for ages, yet sound, and goo
timber, lasting much longer than m
worthy yet eccentric old friend livedo
earth. But I have no doubt but he ha
reached a better region than Kentuck)
however highly that was extolled by hie
while living!
important discovery?how to rende
wood imperishable and incombust]
ble.
From the Gennesee Farmer.
Messrs. Editors :?A discovery of th
highest importance appears to have bee
made in France, by which the long-sough
prerervation of wood from ordinary deca}
combustion, &c., is finally achieved
This has been done by introducing int
the wood itself, through the agency c
vegetable life, the substances which cor
tribute to these important ends.
It has, indeed, been long known t
amateur botanists, that tho flowers c
house plants, &c., may be colored by th
introduction of coloring matter into th
organnization of the plants; and that th
flavors of fruits may sometimes be injure
or destroyed bv liquids poured upon th
ground, at the root of the tree, at the sea
son of their ripening, which are subse
c quently imbibed into tBe vegetable circa- at
. l&tion. But these isolated facts have tin
i hitherto remained with their possessors,
? without any useful suggestions having Mi
s been djawn from them, like a multitude m{
f of other scientific truths, which only re- fOI
t quire to be aplied to the arts, to produce c0
r the most important results of usefelness to ^
1 mankind. r ^
, The announcement of this discovery
i comes to us under circumstances Which
i leave little doubt of its truth. The dis- a?
. coverer having submitted his results to the
f Academy of Sciences, of Paris, a commisi
sion was named from that highly scien- th
? tific body, to investigate the subject, and fu1
. make a report thereon. In the hope of ab
s usefulness, I have made a translation of
/ this report, (omitting some portions, as ir- ?jf
s relvant to my purpose,) for your paper, *gr
i which I subjoin; deeming it highly im- jr(
j portant that experiments should be exten- ^
i, sively made, the ensuing summer, in con. cr
a forraity with the discoverers' process, as
. shown in the report. It would be no tri- .
? fling result to secure timber, in all situa- 1"
. tions, from decay, and our buildings from
5 conflagration, at a cost so trifling as to be pi
. within the reach of all. w
A physician of Bordeaux, Mon9. Bon- al
i cherie, has arrived at the all-important re- ta
r I suit of rendering the tissue of wood almost tl]
1 entirely unattackable by those causes of pt
i destruction to which it is ordinarily sub- ag
* subject; and at the same time his pro- w
. cesses render it much more suitable to the w
r various purposes to which it is applicable t-(
i in the arts.
t A commission to the Academy of Sci- C{
r ences, at Paris, having been named, to ^
* examine the subject, Mons. Dumas, in the C(
c name of the commission, made in Decern- g*(
ber last the following report, as the result c(
* of its investigations : u.
"The Academy has charged Messrs. ^
Arago, de Mibrsl, Poncelet, Gambey,
Audoin, Boussaingault, and myself, with w
the examination of the Memoir of Moos. w
. Boucherie, relative to the preservation
of wood, the following is the result of our 0j
labors: $
i "The Academy has Already examined, 0j
. with the most lively interest, the prepar- 0j
. ations of the author; and it has before w
. it, at this moment, pieces of these so re- ^
, markable that the task of its commission C(
r is thereby greatly abridgod. Mons. Bou:
oherie proposes to render wood much ^
, more durable, to preserve its elasticity, to m
i prevent the voriafions in volume which it ^
s experiences through the agencies of dry (j.
f and humid atmospheres, to diminish its Q|

. and its hardiness; and, finally, to com- ^
t municate to it various and durable colors r(
s and ociors. 1 a
"To assume that all these exigencies g|
/ have been satisfied, and that this has been w
, accomplished by methods, cheap, simple Q]
u and new; and consummated through the w
7 agency of substances that are common, tl
i and which bear but a low price, is to fix ^
j the attention of the Academy, in a few Q|
t words, upon the Important features of the ^
, subject we are charged to examine. (
s "For the purpose of penetrating an en- .
. tire tree with preservative, coloring, or
. other matter, the author has recourse to w
i, no mechanical, costly or complicated .
e means: he finds all the force of which he
ttl
s has need, in that process, within the q(
i tree itself,?the same force by which its
. own sap is elevated and distributed ^
i through its various parts. This, alone, c<
.1 suffices to convey from of the trunk to the
very leaves all the liquids which he .

s are maintained within certain limits of ^
. chemical concentration. If a tree he

t base of the trunk be at once plunged into ^
a a vat or reservoir containing the liquid
e which it is desired the timber shall im.
i. bibe, that liquid in the space of a few
1 days, will ascend to the very leaves, and ^
e penetrate every part of the tissue, except
o the heart of the tree, which in some .

ilhor has net contented himself with
te employment of the chlorate of calcim,
notwithstanding its great cheapness
it he has ann tlyzed the sea water from
te pits of the salt works, which is withit
value, and by so doing has obtained
terefrom all the qualities necessary to
is purpose. The different woods prepaid
by his saline solutions preserve their
exibility, even after several years' expoire
to the air; and thin sheets of this
ood were twisted into spirals, fi.st in
ne direction then in the contrary one,
ithout their suffering the slightest fracire
or injury of any kttod. Exposed to

as to be incapable of sustainig
or propagating conflagration.
"To those highly useful properties,
hich the constructions of ships, bridges,
wellings, &c., will readily appreciate,

hat body received notice from the raipiters
of war and finance, that they had

by public functionaries, and by the

To the President of the Agricultural
? Qmith Cnmlirtn ?
OVSJCiy UJ uuutu vw vtnw
Gentlemen?I ask your attention to
he folloiring resolution, adopted by the
State Agricultural Society, at its last
neeting, held at Columbia:
That the District and Parish Societies
>e invited to present to this Society, at its
innual meeting, an essay or memoir on
the subject to which their notice may res.
pectively be drawn by the President whose
business it shall be to designate the topics
on which information is needed."
There is, perhaps, no member of the
confederacy more dependent on agriculture
than South-Carolina, and none
where that important branch of industry
is more neglected. Of the States composing
the Union, twenty have deemed it
necessary to aid the cause of the husbanman
by legislative enactments. SouthCarolina
Has so far steadily refused to
lend even the influence of her name to
the upholding of that pursuit on which
her wealth and prosperity so intimately
depend. On this exigency, .when, too
the moral and political elements have assumed
a sombre hue, it becomes the southern
tiller of the soil to arouse from his
lethargy, and to direct his efforts to th<
devising of means best calculated to promote
the true interest of his vacation.?
Accurato knowledge concerning the defects
of our agricultural practices, and
the remedies that are accessable and cer
tain, is what is now mainly wanted.?
In furtherance of this object, and the bet
ter to attain the end substantially aimed
at by the Society I now respectfully submit
theselection of the topics for the essayi
to your better judgement, in the confident
hope that subjects may be chosen, adapted
to localities, as will afford light
enough to guide us to the goal of usefu!
and profitable labour.
It is conceded that there exist ruinoui
errors in management, and great neglect
of means and facilities for agricultural improvement.
The fault is too common
for the planter to look exclusively to the
annual income from his crops, witnoui
taking into the estimate at the year's end
whether his plantation, regarded as i
permanent investmentof capital, has beer
improved or deteriorated.
Learned or obstuse dessertations or
husbandry, although they would assist ir
bringing about correct opinions on man)
points perhaps assential to our calling
are not, at this time, the surest means fai
accomplishing our purpose. Plain practi
cal essays alone, the necessity of the oc
casoin, imperatively requires. Iftheser
vice designated in the above resolation be
faithfully performed, I scarcely need saj
to you, that an impulse will be given t(
agriculture, in this State, of vast and per
manent utility. May I add, that this u
a cause in which all can embark. Here
there are no collission of interestor of opin
ion to overcome, and no motives at variance
with private feelings, or public in
nentives to action.
I have the honnortobe, very respeatfully
Your obedient servant,
WHITEMARSH B. SEABROOK,
President S. A. S. of So. Ca.
Edisto Island; June 14,1841.
Editors of papers, friendly to the object
of this circular, are requested to give it ar

Report of the Postmaster General
rt* Mav 9Q. 1841
/"Wt JL/C^/UI W/H/fM} wvj ..
Sir: The arrangement of business at
and the manner of returns to, the Gener
al Post Office, forbid a detailed report o
its operations at the approaching sessioi
of Congress* I have, however, felt it mj
duty, at this time, to call public attentior
to the present state of its finances, so fai
as I have yet been able to learn their con
dition.
When first entering upon myofficia
duties, my attention was forced to the
constant demands for payment beyonc
the ability of the Depurtment to dis
charge; and with a view to ascertain, a*
nearly as might be, its undisputed liabilities
and probable means, on the 27th da\
of March last 8 letter was addressed to
the Auditor of the Treasury for the Post
Office Department, requesting from him
information oq those subjects. A copy
of which letter, marked A, is herewith
submitted. Such statements have not
b$en furnished, for reasons clearly set
fortn in a letter from the Auditor, dated
the 26th day^nf May instant; of which a
copy is hereto appended, Marked B.
It was also important to learn, without
delay, what were the pressing liabilities
and what the active funds of the Department.
For this purpose, directions were
given to the chief clerk to state the
amount due to contractors anterior ,to and
for the quarter ending the 31st December/ ,
1840, so far as they haobeen reported by
the Auditor, and also the amount in de?
posite, subject to draft, for the discharge
of such arrearages. His report is here*
with submitted, marked C.
By an examination of that statement,
it will be seen that there was due and unpaid
to contractors, of ascertained balances,
on the first day of January last,
the sum of four hundred and forty-seven
thousand arid seventy-nine dollars, ($447,.
079,) a considerable portion of which has
been paid from the revenues of the quarter
ending on the 3lst March. A report #
from the Auditor upon all the outstanding
contracts will undoubtedly increase
this amount of indebtedness to a total
exceeding half a million of dollars* In
addition to which, heavy demand* are
frequently made on the Department
upon unliquidated claims. Of such demands,
no notice can be taken at this
time, nor is it proper that an opinion as to
their justice should be now expressed.
Under these circumstances, two questions
naturally present themselves; How
the n?nnrtmAnt to be sustained under
1 its present embarrassments? and, What
are its financial hopes for the future?
As no estimates, upon which can be
' based an answer to the first inquiry, can
be presented until a full statement of
the balances due from postmasters shall
( have been reported by the Auditor, it is
( passed, with the single remark, that, alr
though it can hardly be doubted that a
large aggregate sum will be found due,
. it is to be feared that, from the small
. amount of most of such separate balances,
i scattered throughout this wide-spread
t nation, the want of responsibility in mfcny
of these offcers and many of their seeuri'
ties, and the lapse of time since these
' balances accrued, but an inconsiderable
part of the amount actually due will ever
be received. It therefore remains for
Congress to determine whether the
i amount now due to contractors shall be
paid, from the National Treasury, or
, whether this Department shall struggle
l on with its present embarrassments, con.
suming its daily accruing revenues in
t the partial payment of old debts, and still
I leaving large balances which it has not
the ability to discharge,
i Notwithstanding the heavy increased
t expenditure consequent upon the act of
' 7th July, 1838, and although, instead of
1 the supposed g adual increase of revenue,
' the receipts for the quarter ending 31st
| March last present, as compared with the
corresponding quarter of the year before,
1 a diminution of more than 6 per cent,
still the Department would probably find
, sufficient relief in its future operations
, from the decrease of prices which, it may
r be calculated, will be hereafter demanded
, upon most of the routes, were it not for
r the continually increasing exactions ia
. other branches of the service.
To present this subject in its most in
telligible form, the First Assistant Post5
master General has prepared a tabular
r view of recent proposals, that comparison
} may be made between the amount ot
present bids and the sums now paid for
mail service upon the same routes.?
This table is hereto annexed, marked D.
On examination of this statement, it
will be seen that, in some cases, the
amount demanded by railroad companies
for transportation of the mails is more
than two hundred per cent, higher than
is paid for coach service, upon roads
' j:<?
forming connecting link? oeiween an.
ferent railroad companies, upon the same
9 main route, and that too where the night
1 service upon the railroads is less than that
, performed in coaches. Such demands
l deserve more consideration from the fact
* that, whilst at the recent lettings in
New York and in the six Eastern Statfes
, the accepted service by coaches and oth.
er modes of conveyance has been secured
f at an average saving of twenty.two per
i cent, upon the contracts of 1837, there
r are but few instances where the demands
i of incorporated companies have not been
r increased in such manner as imposed
. upon me the necessity of suspending the
contracts. Nor is the extravagant price.
i demanded for mail transportation upon,
? railroads the only manner in which thqse. *
I incorporations affect the revenue of this
. Department. The facilities secured byi
