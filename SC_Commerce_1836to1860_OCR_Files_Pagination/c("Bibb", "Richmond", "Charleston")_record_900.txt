ON THE DEATH <!>F A MISSIONARY.
WXM. P. WIULlS.
They laid him down with strangers; for his boms
Wat with the setting sun, and they who stood
And look'd'do steadfastly upon his grave, -j
Wsivnt* hia kindred; but they found him there,
And loved ■.;(n fol> his ministry of Christ. , . . ,
, He had died yt«ng. But there are silver'd heads,
Whose race of dm, ja [eu nobly run.
His heart .^wae with Jerusalem ; as strong
At wa| m mother's love, ur,d the sweet ties J
Religion makes so beautiful n home,
He flung them from him in his e.gtr race,'
And sought the broken people of h„ God, ,.
To Predch to them of Jesus. There vasone, .
Who was his friend and helper. One W.0 Went
And knelt besitle him at the sepulchre
Where Jesus slept to pray for Israel.
They had one spirit, and their hearta were knit
With more than human love. God call’d him home.
And he of whom I spake stood up alone.
And in his broken-heartedness wrought on
Until his Master call’d him.
Oh, is it hot a noble thing to die
As dies the Christian, with his armour on I
What is the hero’s clarion, though its blast
Ring wit,h tbs mastery of a world, to this!
What ore the searching victories of mind—
The lore of vanished ages 1 What are all
The trumpeting of proud humanity,.
To the short history of him who made
His sepulchre beside the King of kings!

How mysterious the ways of providence ! Only
a few months ago we announced to the readers of
the So. Ch. Advocate the triumphant death of
sister Pendergrass. Rev. Bingham Pender
GRASB, her husband, is now no more. He died in
Jackson. Co., Ga., of bilious pleurisy, Feb. 13.
1845, Id the 34th year of his age. Brought up by
pious parents, he ‘‘ remembered his Creator in the
days of his youth.’’ Whilst young he was appoint
ed .served . the church as a class-leader, sub
sequently as an exhorter, and for the last two or
three years of his life as a local preacher, in all of
which stations he was zealous, ardent, and useful.
He was modest, unassuming, and even retiring
and timid in his disposition, but a man of sound
mind and good talents for usefulness, who felt, in no
ordinary degree, ** the joys of God’s salvation.”
His affliction lasted nearly two weeks before na
ture yielded, through tU of which time he was in
great pain, but his soul was staid on God. He as
sured his friends that his way was clear, and he
only desired to live for the sake of his orphan
children: but God willed it otherwise. He died
in peace, calmly committing his spirit into the
hand of his merciful Creator, and now rests from
his labours with his sainted wife in heaven.
John Wesley Pendergrass, the brother of
Bingham, is also gone to join the company of his
friends in a better world. He died, Feb. 19, 1845,
of the same disease. He was pious from his very
childhood. When but three or four years old he
was in the habit of retiring and pouring out bis
soul in secret prayer, and doubtless holdiug sweet
communion with God. He grew up in the ‘‘ nur
ture and admonition of the Lord.” Never could
he be enticed to keep company with the evil and
profane, and if accidently or unknowingly thrown
into the company of such, on making she discovery
he immediately fled, and although he was cheerful
and pleasant, he entirely abstained from levity.
He died in the 32d year of his age a ‘‘vessel
meet for the Master’s use.” On his death bed he
complained of not feeling so much of the joy of
God’s salvation as he had done in times past,
yet no fearful anticipation of the future, nor dark
cloud of gloom such as hovers over the guilty in a
dying hour, was permitted to settle on his spirit.
The waters of Jordan were cold and deep: he
struggled hard in death ; nature was loth tuyield ;
but the billows have gone over him, and his spirit
has doubtless entered into that “rest that re
mained) to the people of God.” W’m. J. Parks.

married to Mr. Samuel Mai his, wnn was long and
favourably known in Camden. About the year
1801, she was converted and joined the Methodist
E. Church. Sister Mathis was one of the first
Methodists in Camden. Her house was, Tor many
years, the preacher’s home. Bishop Asbury and I
all the first Methodist preachers in this part of the i
country often partook of her hospitality. From j
1808, to the time of her death, her house had been
a regular place for class.meeting. She was a
consistent Methodist, a zeah us and faithful Chris
tian, and a shining light in this community. Her
death was very sudden and unexpected ; and her
friends, consequently, was not favoured with her
. dying testimony. But they were witnesses of
her holy life and godly conversation, and are con
fident that their loss is hpr eternal gain,_that
being “absent from the body,” she is “present
with the Lord.” “ 1 heard a voice from heaven
saying unto me Write, Blessed are the dead which
die in the Lord from henceforth : Yea, saith the
Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and
their works do follow them.” W. P. M

to So. Ca. in early life, and has been, for the last
fifteen years, an acceptable member of the M. E.

station of class-leader, which he filled to the satis
faction and edification of all concerned, and with
much credit to himself. In all the relations of life
he met, with propriety and usefulness, tho varied
duties which devolved upon him.-' His end was
peace, with Christian calmness and composure,
he bade adieu to his earthly friends, and entered
upon the eternal realities to which his faith had
looked beyond the grave;—sustained to the last
by an abiding assurance that “ it is a faithful say
ing, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ
Jesus came into the world to save sinners.”

THE SONG OP THE STREAMLET.
BT JOHN INMAN.
Brightly md gaily the streamlet went dancing
on its way tomingle its pure waters with those
of the broad mtjestic river. Murmuring it glid
ed over tonnd smooth pebbles, gleaming white
in the reflected sunbeams that glanced down, as
if in love, upon thebosom of the rivulet, through
the openings made frnong the overhanging foli
age by the fitful sigljngs of the breeze. Be
tween verdant margin* ran the stream; mar
gins ol soft green turf, et9raelled here and there
with flowers. Water-lili>8 floated on its bosom,
glorious in their simple 'leauty. Silence was
around it; the deep blue Sry of summer-morn
ing was above ; beauty in a’housand forms sur
rounded it on every side, o-owned with the
beauty of solitude and peace. The streamlet
felt its happiness, and thus in vild but gentle
melody it sang:—
Gaily, peacefully, happily on lglide to min
gle my pure waters yith those oT the mighty
river. Thus for thousands of years have I been
running, and thus to the end of time Siall I con
tinue to run my course, in sunshine ot jD shade
unknowing whence I came, uncaring vhither I
go, or what is to be my destiny when Svallow
ed up in the great sea, to which the rVer is
hastening also. Such was the course narked
out for me by my Creator, and for no other iave
I wish or ambition. To do that for which I Vil8
assigned,—to be always doing,—this is my oijy
thought. And this, too, is the only thought if
all that exists and dots around me. The treei
put forth their leaves in spring, and their fruits
in summer; in autumn the leaves fall, leaving
the naked and desolate branches to bide as they
may the piercing assault of the’ winter blasts’;
but spring comes again,and again the unweary
ing tree puts forth its leaves, and prepares to
live over again the same unvarying round of
duty. The grass and the flowers also fulfil,
year after year, the task that is given to them •
the birds build their nests and bring forth their
young ; the resplendent sun shines out at his ap
pointed time, as he shone in ages long past • and
the lovely moon pours down her radiance night
ly to glitter upon my breast. All that is created
knows what it has to do, and that does—all ex
cept Man. the restless, the ever-dissatisfied, the
ever-rebellious against his. lot.
Oh Man, wonderful and most favoured amon®
all created tnings, wise though thou art, and en
dowed with faculties like unto those of my Cre
ator, disdain not the lesson that may be taught
thee even by. us thy inferiors and servants.
Learn from us that in doing is the purpose of thy
creation to be fulfilled ; for thou also hast thy ap
pointed work to do.
As the drops.of which the stream is composed
pass on, each in its turn and place, to be seen no
more, to form part of the stream no more, so
does each son or daughter of humanity emerge
for u brief space from the void of non-existence
to form part of the great current along which the
tide of human life is flowing ; each is but a drop
—the least of all conceivable drops in that
mighty stream—yet each has an assigned place
to fill, an assigned share of performance to ex
ecute ; the place may be infinitely small: the
duty to be fulfilled may be infiuitely’unimportant
of itself; yet of millions so small is the immense
up. \_/uc ucic aiiu aiiomer mere
may start aside from the course; one here and
another there may refuse to perform his part, and
even put forth his strength to hinder the rest in
their toil; yet the stream flows on,—the resist
less current of man’s destiny keeps on its course,
even as the resistless current of time keeps on,
alike sweeping away him that hinders and him
that helps. And even as to the drop of the flow
ing streamlet, which should be foolish enough
to resist the perpetual flow that bears it on to be
lost in the great river, darting from side to side,
or striving to mount upward again toward its
source in the mountaiu rill—if drop so unwise
thei e might be—even as to suph, the fruit of its
foolish resistance would be only trouble and toil
thrown away, while the streamlet would’flow on
unchecked, so does the child of man, who puts
not his hand to the work that is appointed for
him to do, gain only trouble and toil tor himself,
while the stream of his kind’s destiny flows on'
resistless and solemn, as if it were not; and after
a little time,—less than a moment to the stupend
ous whole, but to himself an eternity of ages,
because to him it is all time,—he is borne away
to the vast sea of the unknown, and his power
for evil or good, with himself, is lost in the void
for ever.
Oh Man, what wisdom it were in thee to
know the excellence and the beauty of quiet!
Come to the humble streamlet, stand on its
grassy brink, and see with what gladness of
heart it glides smoothly along; swiftly now,
with an arrow flight, where its approaching
banks give it but narrow space, and now with a
roore 8ent*e fl°wj where with its expanded sur
face it Ties spnad out like a lake under the clear
sunshine and the celestial blue of the vault on
high. See how it rejoices in the accomplish
ment of its destiny, having ever before it only the
me object for which it was called into existence
—to mingle its clear waters with those of the
majestic river—striving only to do that,cherish
ng no delusive hope or ambition of being or
loing save only that, putting forth all its powers
or that, and murmuring ever its song of content
md joy as it speeds along in the light of its own
jeauty, in the happiness of its duty fulfilled.
Never, save when hindered in its course. do« s it
ift its voice in aught but the gentle song of com
ent and joy; where some fragment of rock op
poses its progress, there its murmur is changed
oa loud and complaining note; but the rock
svaded by a turn to the right or left, the stream
el flows on again peacefully as before, forget
ful of the injury it had sustained, too happy for 1
the memory of aught but its task, for the con
sciousness of aught but the blessing and the
charm of that quiet which alone it seeks.
Thou seest, oh child of humanity, how gaily
my waters sparkle in the beams of the noon-day
sun ; but come to my grassy brink at nightfall,
when the shade of twilight hovers around thee 1
and me, and the whole beautiful landscape,—
come, wearied with long travel, and faint with
the heat of the long summer-day,—then bathe
thy fevered brow in my cool stream—drink deep
of my pure cold waters, nnd lay this truth to thy
soul, that, if it be worthy of man’s ambition n
shine out in the blaze of renown, there is good al
so in the shade of peaceful and safe obscurity. I
Part of my winding course I run through broad
level plains, where no tree interposes its dpnse
foliage between me and the clear blue sky ; part
also through groves and forests, whose deep
shade is ever upon me; whose broad boughs arc
ever waving above my breast, excluding the
bright sunshine, and hiding the fair scene from
ye, as they hide me from the gaze of all that
might love to look on my beauty. Yet, through
the broad level plain and the dark screening for
est alike joyful I run, remembering that if in the
former I shine out moie fair, and have more to
gaze on me admiringly as I flow', in the latter I
find that peace and security which 1 so dearly
love. There come no fierce how ling winds to
ruffle my tranquil stream—they waste their force
on the tall trees at whose feet I glide; there comp
no falling floods fiom above to plough up my
gentle breast, and lash my quiet deeps into fury
—they descend harmless upon the thick over
hanging canopy of foliage under w hose shelter
1 hide in safety. Pine not, struggle not, there
fore, oh child of humanity, for tho broad and
high places of life; there the storms of adversity
beat down on thee most heavily, and there is thy
exposure 10 metr rage most aetenceless. And re
member, too, that ifthesunshineof prosperity and
glory that beams around thee there be gorgeous
to the eye, it dazzles sometimes even to blinding,
and that the warmth which vivifies may yet in
the end consume.
Stretch thyself down beside me on that green
knoll, around which my stream winds in its de
vious beauty. The sun is yet high in the hea
vens, and though thy restless spirit yearns for the
turmoil and bustle of that world in which it is
for thee to strive, to hope, and to do, there is
time for thee to pause awhile, communing with
thy own heart and with me in this healthful soli
tude. Impatient as thou art, oh man, deem not
the time lost that is passed here, far away from
the din of that eternal contest in which thou hast
borne thy part, it maybe—from which thou hast
escaped from a brief season, and to v^bich thou
must soon return. Ever the waves of that con
test are heaving, and with them thou must con
tend,to ride triumphantly on their swelling crests,
or it may be, after a brief and profitless struggle,
to go down in their depths for ever, thy hopes un
fulfilled, thy aims unaccomplished, leaving no
trace behind of all that thou hast done, or at
tempted, or dreamed. Stretch thyself down be
side me, here in the mellow light of the summer’s
declining sun, and gaze, into my smooth flowing
waters. Thou beholdest thine own features
I'rlancing up to thineeyes from my watery depths.
| S-wiftly my waters flow, and not for a single mo
ment—not for a thousandth part of the time that
is «iken up in a single beat of a throbbing heart
—dies the glassy surface beneath thee remain
unchnged. The water on which thou wast
looking nn instant since is gone from before thee,
to be Here no more for ever; not more rapidly
does the thought passthrough thy mind than
the liquid, plane from which that image was re
flected bu now, and as rapidly to be replaced
by anothe- from which it will be reflected
in turn But there, ever unqhanging, on
moving, fixed as if graven upon adamant, the
image remaim, Yet it is unsubstantial, intangi
ble nothing—amere semblance and show, exist
ing only in certa-n filaments of thy nervous sys
tem. acted upon it some mysterious way by the
rays of light, and it some way still more myste
rious acting upon thy perceptive mind. The
water is real, and it pisses away—the shadow re
mains, motionless.
What lesson of wisdom gatherest thou from
tfiis ? Thy existence, oh child of humanity, is
real ;thou art a substantia' something in this thy
world ; a substantial, tan^ble element of the
great creation. And thou passest a wav like
my flowing waters: the place that I as known
these knows thee more ; it wt* filled but a mo
ment since by another whom thou hast supplan
ted, and in a moment hence it v-ill be filbd by
another, supplanting thee. But thy thought re
mains; that which thou hast said thought, or
done, remains, unchanging, unchangeable for
ever. Of little moment is it to thee, therefore,
what aspect thy body wears, or how it ;s clothed
or lodged, or what food sustains it; hr be it
repulsive or comely, trick*d out in the fantastic
decorations of royalty, or scantily shield) d from
cold and wet by the rags of the beggar, pam
pered with costly viands, or nourished with tho
rude but hunger-flavored crust of the toiling pea
sant, a time soon comes when it must pass away
and be no more seen ; when that which it has
been—the how 3nd the where—shall be of no
moment to thee or 10 any, or thy race or the
«ruua luri UIC aillUIJ or WOrCI 01
thine, once gone forth, can be no more recalled ;
be it for weal or wo to thyself or to others, it is
there—garnered up among the imperishable
things of the past;—omnipotence itself can nei
ther annihilate nor change it. Take no care
then, oh child of humanity, what thou art, but
give heed to all thou doest or sayesl_to the
speech of thy lips and the thought of thy mind ;
these are the reflection of thy image upon the
evergliding stream of time, enduring as that re
flection of thy features from my ever-changing
bosom.
Another lesson for the study, in the reflection
that meets thine eyes as thou liest there gazing
upon the flow of my waters. Thou kno west its
existence is not in the element, but only in the
glassy surface on which it seems to be imprint
ed and that though the element change more
rapidly even than thy perception can note the
passage of time, the glassy surmce always re
maining, the image also remains. The water
that gave it back to thee a moment since has
passed on—before thou canst take consciousness
ofllo; thought even, the water which now gives
it back to thee will have passed that which
shall give back the ima^e a moment hence is yet
of the stream above thee. Both to that which is
coming and that which is gone the image is not
—is as it never had been and never should be.
Only for that on which at a single and inappre
ciable point oftimeiis impression is made, has it
its existence. Thou mayst learn from this, oh
Man, that in life the present alone is subject to
thy control—the present only isthatin whichthou
canst work, and to the use of which thou shouldst
give heed. The future will surely come—tor
ment not thyself in speculation upon its aspect or'
its charge ; the past is beyond thy control—waste
not thy spirit in vain regrets or vainer self-ap
plaudmgs over its disappointments or its success
es. dive thy thoughts to the task of the present
—to the opportunities it affords thee and the du
ties it requires from thee; for it is with these
that thou must prepare to meet the future.
Despise not, oh Man, these teachings, but
even as thou hast listened to them with patience, I
in thy superiority of endowment and station, apply
them to practice in thy conduct and life. I know
that the streamlet is humble in place and duty—
and humblest among the streamlets am I. Yet
I know that the great river is noble in its utility
ind its majestic beauty; mighty among the ser
vants of man, and high in his estimation. And
the great river in its majestic flow, in its unfath
omed depths, and the irresistible force of its,
mighty current, owes all that it is and all that it
has to my sisters and me. Were it not fed and
sustained by the streams from a thousand hills,
its deep bed would in a single night lie bare ol
its waters, a mere unsightly channel, noisome
with mud and ooze. Qreat ships would no more
be wafted upon its bosom, the earth no more be
fertilized by its nourishing stream. Small am 1,
lowly and insignificant; yet I have my part to
do in the fulfilment of ends great even beyond my
conception, and of high importance to thee, oh
Man, and thy wonderful race. Little may be
that part—trifling maybe the evils that would
ensue from failure of mine to do it; but all thi
merit 1 claim is fidelity in its performance ; all
the ambition I feel is to do well; all the desire 1
cherish is to go on steadily in that humble but
clear path of duty. For I know that it is not so
much in the achievement ot great things, or fil
ling a large place in the world of being and do
ing, that merit either of man or streamlet consists,
but in laboring well and faithfully in the work
that is given—in filling as best we may
the place, whether lofty or low, whether
narrow or wide, in which we have been
slotted our portion among the things thatareand
that are to be—the things to be done and suffer
ed.
Thus murmured the streamlet—not without
wisdom or melody—as it went on its way, in the
singleness of its purpose and hope, to mingle its
clear waters with those of the majestic river.
THE PYRAMIDS.
Geologically considered, Egypt is a very pe
culiar country, the quarries of different kinds of
stone lying at great distances from each other in
distinctly marked localities. If you see a piece
of basalt on the beach of the Mediterranean, you
know that there is no basaltic quarry nearer
than between the first and second cataracts, and,
when you find a block of granite of Memphis,
you know that no granite exists but at the first
cataract—nearer than the eastern desert on the
Red Sea with the peninsula.of Mount Sinai.
Early civilization and extended dominion are in
dicated in these facts, and when we reflect upon
them, we almost think we witness the work of
transportation going on, that we seethe builders,
and the buildings themselves in the process of
erection. The blocks of Arabian limestone used
in the, interior of the Pyramids were brought
from the ancient quarries of Toorah, on the op
posite side of the Nile, distant about fifteen or
twenty miles from each pyramid. These veiy
quarries, vast halls as it were, excavated in the
living rock, wheiein entire armies might en
camp, adorned with now mutilated tablets, re
I cording the age of their respective openings by
differt nt Pharaohs, not only shows the very beds
whence the stupendous blocks ol the pyramids
were taken, but are in themselves works as won
drous and sublime as the Memphite Pyramids 1
Nay, at the very foot of these quarries lie the
countless tombs and sarcophagi of unnumbered
generations of ancient quarry-men 1 These
quarries are of intense archteological interest,
because thetabhts in them record that stone
was cut in them for Memphis, on such a day,
such a month, such a year of the leign of such a
king: and these kings begin from the remote
times before the sixteenth dynasty, and, at differ
ent intervals, come down through the Pharaonic
period with many of the others, till we reach the
Ptolemaic epoch—and end with Latin inscrip
tions similar to others in Egypt, attesting that
“these quarries were worked” in the propitious
eias of our Lords and Emperors Severus and
Antoninus, thus enabling us to d> scend almost
step by step from the remote antiquity of 2200
years B. C.,down to 200 years after the Chris
tian era. The hand of modern barbarism,
prompted by the destructiveness of Mohammed
Ali, has since 1830 done more to deface these ta
ble ts, to blow up many of these halls in sheer
wantonness, than has been effected by time in
4000 years!
Every atom of the hundred thousand tons of
Granite used in the pyramids was cut at Syene,
the first cataract, distant six hundred and forty
miles. The blocks, some of which are forty
feet long, had to be cut out ol their beds with
wooden wedges and copper chisels; then polish
ed with emery till they were smooth as looking
glass, and then carried by land half a mile to the
river—placed on rafts and floated don n six hun
dred and forty miles to Memphis, brought by
canals to the foot of the Lvbian chain—convey*
ed by land over gigantic causeways from one to
three mileg in length to the pyramids for which
they were intended, and then elevated by machin
ery and placed in their present position with a
skill and a masonic precision that have confoun
ded the most scientific European engineer with
amazement. 1 he very basalt sarcophagi that
once held the mummy of the Pharaohs, in the
inmost recesses of these pyramidal mausolea 8 J
feet long by 3} broad and 3 deep, were all
brought from Lower Nubia, from the basaltic
quarries of the second cataract, not nearer than
seven hundred and fifty miles up the river!
Looking into the interior of the pyramids, there
is still much to stagger belief, to excite otrr ad
miration. In the pyramid of five steps, the up
per beams that suppott the roof of the chamber
are of oak, larch and cedar, notone of which
trees grows in Egypt, and establish the fact of
the timber trade with Illyria, Asia Minor, and
Mount Lebanon in ages long before Abraham I
In the fragments of a mummy the cloth is found
to be saturated with the “Pissaspnaltum”—Jew’s
pitch or bitumen Judaicutn, compounded of ve
getable pitch from the Archipelago, and of as
phaltum of the Dead Sea in Palestine: we find
Gum Arabic, that does not grow nearer than
twelve hundred miles from the pyramid, attest
ing commerce with Upper Nubia. The gold
leaf came from the mines of Suakim on the Ked
Sea, or fiom remote Fazorglu. The liquor
which cleansed out the body of the mummy was
Cealria the fluid rosin of the pinus cedrus—that
grows not nearer than Syria. The spices send
us to the Indian Ocean, the aloes to Socotro, the
cinnamon to Ceylon, the ancient Taprobane, and
the arts and sciences brought to bear upon the
pyramids that must have arrived long before that
day, are not only themes for endless r< flections,
but oblige us to confess that in Chronology vve
are yet children !—Gliddon.
THE TONGUE.
There are but ten precepts of the law of God,
says Leighton, and two of them so far as con
cerns the outward organ and vent of the sins
there forbidden, are bestowed on the tongue (one
in the first table, and the other in the second ta
ble)—as though it were ready to fly out, both
against God and man, if not thus bridled.
Pythagoras used to say that a wound from the'
tongue is worse than a wound from the sword,
for the latter affects only the body, ihe former
the spirit—the soul.
It was a remark of Anacharsis, that the tongue
was at the same time the best part of man and
the -wont—that with good government none is
more useful, and without it none is more mis
chievous.
Boerhaave, says Dr. Johnson, was never sour
ed by calumny and detraction ; nor ever thought
it necessary to confute them, “ for/' said he,
“they are sparks, which, if you do not blow
them, will go out of themselves." j
We cannot, says Cato, control the evil tongues
of others, but a good life enables us to despise
them.
Slander, says Lacon, cannot make the subjects
of it either better or worse. It may represent
os in a false light, or |31ace a likeness of us in a
I bad one. But we are the same. Not so to the j
slanderer—the slander that he utters makes him
worse, the slandered, never.
No one, says Jerome, loves to tell a tale of
slander except to him who loves to heaY it.
Learn then to rebuke and check the detracting
tongue, by showing that you do not listen to it
with pleasure.
No man sees the-wallet on bis own back, says
the proverb, alluding to the fable of the traveller
with two packs, the one before stuffed with the
1 faults of his neighbours—the other behind, with
his own.

PROCRASTINATION.
Sir Walter Scott, writing to a friend who had
obtained a situation, gave him this excellent ad
vice ;—“You must be aware of stumbling over
a propensity which easily besets you, from not
having yourlime fully employed. I mean what
the women very expressively call dawdling.
Your motto must be, Hoc age. Do instantly
whatever is to be done, and take the hours of re
creation after business and never before it. Whet)
a regiment is under march, the rear is often
thrown into confusion because the front do not
move steadily, and without interruption. It is
the same thing with business. . If that which is
first in hand is not instantly, steadily, and regu
larly despatched, other things accumulate behind,
till affairs begin to press all at once, and no hu
man brain can stand the confusion. Pray mind
this : this is a i.abit of mind which is very apt to
beset men of intellect and talent, especially when
their time is not regularly filled up, and is left at
their own arrangement. But it is like the ivy
round the oak, and ends by limiting, if it does not
destroy, the power of manly and necessary exer
tion. I must love a man so well, to whom I of
fer such a word of advice, that I will not apolo
gise for it, but expect to hear you are become as
regular as a Dutch clock—hours, quarters, min
utes, all marked and appropriated. This is a
great can in life and must be played with all
skill and caution.
. MATERNAL AFFECTION.
The charms of woman are certainly many and
I powerful. The expanding rose, just bursting
! into beauty, has an irresistable bewitchingness;
* the blooming bride, led triumphantly to the hy
i meneal altar, awakens admiration dnd interest,
Und the blush of her cheek fills with delight;
| but the charm of maternity is more sublime than
I alljjfcese.
I Heaven has imprinted on the mother’s face
something beyond this world, something which
claims kindred with the skies—the angelic smile,
the tender look, its walking, watchful eye, which
' keeps the fond vigil over her slumbering oabe.
' These are objects which neither the pencil
- nor the chisel can touch, which poetry fails to
: exalt; which the most eloquent tongue in vain
i would eulogize; and of which all description
becomes ineffective. In the heart of man lies
this lovely picture; it lives in his sympathies ; it
reigns in his affection, his eye looks around in
; vain for such another object on earth.
Maternity, extatic sound I so twined around
our hearts, that they must cease to throb ere we
forget!’tis our first love; tis part of our religion.
N .ture has set the mother upon such a pinnacle
that our infant eyes and arms are first uplifted to
it; we cling to it in manhood; we almost wor
ship it in old age. He who can enter an apart
ment, and behold the tender babe feeding on its
mothers beauty—nourished by the tide of life
which flows through her generous veins, with
out a panting bosom and a grateful eye, is no man,
but a monster.
TEMPER AN CE.
THE MOTHER AND HER SAILOR BOY.
Rev. £. N. Taylor related the following at a
sailor’s temperance meeting in Boston : Three
years since, I called to see a widow, one of our
sisters, who had long been expecting her only
son, a noble young sailor, from sea. The ship
in which he sailed, had been due over three
months, and the poor widow began to think that
her darling boy, her only support, had found a
watery grave. Well, I talked the matter over
with her, and endeavored to cheer her with the
hope of seeing him soon. You know, gentlemen,
my motto is, “never say die, "—and while I was
yet speaking, she seized my arm and exclaimed,
‘ Hush I hush I that’s my William’s voice—I
know it is—his step, too, on the stairs—he
comes !—my own William comes I’
Open flew the door, and there stood the noble
youth, with his arms extended ready for a spring.
He gazed an instant, his eye caught his mother’s,
and they were locked in each other’s embrace.
They kissed and wept, and kissed again, and I
wept too ; and there we all three stood weeping
with joy. Oh, it was a glorious sight! It was
truly a happy return !
j Well, brethren, when we had recovered
breath, the old lady, still simpering, inquired,
what had detained her William so Ion®. *
‘Why, mother,’ replied he, ‘you see we lost
our masts in a gale of! the Cape, and have been
hobbling along ever since, under jury-masts
Nobody <jot hurt—ship’s a fine sea boat—cap-,
tain’s a noble fellow ; but—what! is this Father
Taylor ?’—turning to me—‘God bless you—I
am glad to see you—how are your folks?’—and
he grasped me with both hands, and shook me
as if I had. been laboring under a Florida ague.
‘ But come,’ he cominued, ‘my traps (chest and
pack) arc below, and I must get them up; so
you must excuse.’ A few minutes afterwards
we separated.
The next Sunday, I stood where I now stand; !
the greater part of the seats were nearly full','
and brother Foster was getting some settees rca
dy, when my attention was arrested by the young 1
sailor, with his fund mother on his arm. Oh,
he was a noble looking fellow I—straight as an
ash, firm as a pillar, yet when he walked seem- j
ed pliant as a willow. Shall I forget him 1 No, I
never 1 That day—it was summer at the time
—he wore a bluejacket, white trowsers, and on
the turned-down collar of his snowy shirt, dan-.
gled the glossy locks of raven's hue. His face
and neck were deeply bronzed by the sun,
tho easy smile that played about his mouth, and
the heart cheerfulness that gleamed in his hasel
eyes, threw over his whole countenance a halo
of intellectual sunshine. As be walked up the -*
aisle, the fond mother looked around with an air
of admiration, as much as to aay, “See you not J;.
my noble boy?—why don’t you rejoice with
me? But there was no occasion for it, if such
vvere her thoughts, for wherever he came in
view, he was the observed of all observers. Nor •
was his exterior the better part of him. His >
heart was noble, and his soul large enough to
take in all mankind. ■
I had frequent opportunities of seeing him du
ring thenext week, and still he seemed unchang
ed ; but—my heart bleeds while I tell it—in the
early part of the second week, he was seen stand
ing at the corners of the streets, smoking and
talking with some of his shipmates. The day *'■
on which they received their- wages, sailor like
they all assembled in a rum shop to take a purl
ing glass. That glass was fatal to William.-—
Each treated in his turn, and ere they separated
they were nearly all intoxicated. William was
one of those proud spirits who are at times pos
sessed of considerable firmness, and believe that
they can abstain from the use of liquor by the
fiee action of their own will, rather than to be
tied down by a pledge. The first debauch had
fired his appetite—his self-possession had left
him, and more min wus required to quench his
uuimng ujiisi. ii'Tu i ieji yuiijinai DHOreDat
uiday night he was reeling as a common drunk
ard through the streets! At last, nature gave
way, and he was carried to his mother’s dwell
ing which, but a fortnight before, his presence
had rendered the scene of so much happiness. 1
called to see him, and there he lay, extended on
a mattrass ; his once glossy locks clotted with
mud, and his manly face smeared with sun dried
gore. And there, too, by his pillow sat his dis
consolate mother, bathing his fevered temple
with vinegar and weeping as if her heart would
break. I endeavored to so.-the .her, but she was
like Rachel weeping for her children, and refus
ed to be comforted.*' When he heard *tny voice,
, he raised his head, and in a rough and savage'
' voice, demandtd of his mother more rum !
“Rum” he exclaimed—“rum I want! Curst
| you, give me some rum, and stop your foolish
prating!”
(Herr Mr. Taylor threw his arms upwards,
and gazing in the same direction, as if his whole
sou! were in his eyes, raised his voice and con
tinued—“Cursehis mother !—Hply God!—shut <
the windows of heaven down, and ht not the
sound go up—he curses his mother!”)
Rum, brethren, did this for the noblest of
God’s creatures. (Here Mr. 'faylor paused,
but such was the interest the narrative excited,
that several voices inquired—“What became of
him 1—what did he do ?") He did, resumed
Mr. T., what I want you all to do to-night_
when he recovered he signed the pledge, and
now commands a vessel out of this port, and his
mother is still with us singing glory to God I
The speaker sat down, "and when all was
quiet, a tall, gentlemanly man rose up, and after
surveying the audience a moment, and wiping
the perspiration from his forehead, he said, “I
am the man !”—and resumed his seat again._

CHILDREN.
WHICH IS THE GENEROUS BOY?
“ Mary,” said Albert one day when he and
his little brother Charlie were with their sister
in the parlor, I believe Josiah Hale is the most
generous boy in the world.”
“ Do you,” said his sister, “I think I know one
more generous, even in our village.”
“ A boy in our village as generous as Josiah
Hale I Why 1 don’t see who he can be. What
is his namej”
“His name is Joseph Page. You know him
very well. He lives in the little old house at
the low er end of Penny lane."
“Joseph Page." rep.ated Albert, his counten
ance expressing a great dial of surpiise, “Joseph
Page inpre generous than Josiah Hale? Why
sister, you are making fun of me!"
“No,” replied Mary, .“I am quite serious.
Josrph Page is the most generous boy of my
acquaintance.”
“ But Mary,” said Albert, “ Joseph Page has
nothing to give. His mother is very poor. His
clothes are all over patches, and I have seen
him without stockings in vtwycold weather.”
“And I remember,’ said little Charlie, look
ing eager ly up in his sistei’s face, “ when you
gave him some of Albeit’s stockin-sto keep his
feet warm. What cuu he have to giveaway?
But, perhaps,” said he, turning towards Albert,
and his countenance brig m. ned us if he had
caught a happy thought, “ perhaps sister means
that he would be generous if he had any thing to
give.”
James taugntu a nine at tne sell satisfied tone
with which his little brother spoke, and Mary
smil'd as she replied,
“ No Charlie that is not ray meaning. I sup
pose that if Joseph Page was tich he would dq,
more good than he can at present, but he gives
more now than any boy whom I know. I will
relate something about him, which 1 am sure is
true, and then you can judge yourselvts of bis
generosity. He sometimes does errands for
Mr. Hill, the store-keeper. The money which
he obtains in this, and in various o'her ways he
carries directly to his mother, nor will he accept
from her a single cent to purchase any little
thing for himself, though she often urges him to
do so. Sometimes Mr. Hill on pay day will
give him two or three apples, or a gingerbread
cake, but he never eats them himself. Some
times his mother will refuse to eat the cake, or
an apple, unless he will share it with her, and
then he will put his arms about her neck, and
coax her so affectionately, telling her how much
happier he shall be to see her eat it, than to eat it
himself.
Once when his mother had persuaded him to
take part of a gingerbread cake, he put it in his
pocket, and she suppos.d that he afterwards eat
it. Instead of that, however, he curried it to old
Katie, who you know lives in an upper room of
the same house. And she' says that he often
brings her a rosy-cheeked apple, w hich no doubt
his mother has obliged him to take for himself.
The giving up of an apple, or a gingerbread
cake may not, my dears, seem to you like much
of a sacrifice, for you have enough of both, be
sides many other luxuries; but if like Joseph
you had very seldom anything but potatoes, and
a little salt to eat, you would understand how
much - self-denial he practises. Josiah Hale
gtves cakes, fruit, marbles, and other things of
which he has more than enough. His allow
ance of pocket money is large and he makes no
sacrifice by his gifts.” The boys had listened
with much interest, aud as soon us Mary had
finished James exclaimed ; “ Yes that’s the true
gene-rosit\',”and little Charlie, with tears standing
in his large blue eyes, said, “ That’s a real good
boy, and i mean to ask father to let me give turn
my quarter of a dollar.” Y.
