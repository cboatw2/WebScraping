PROSPECTUS t
of tim i
Camden Commercial Courier. :
THE Establishment of the COMMERCIAL; J
COURIER was rendered necessary by the incon- ' j
venience to which our citizens have been subjected . {
for the want of a public channel of communication (
which in a commercial community like Camden, is f
essentially necessary, and consequently the COU- j
Kl Ell S claim on the public is such as should cn- I
sure a liberal patronage.
The undersigned have spared no trouble or ex- i 4
pense in obtaining the best workmen in order to ,
render the Paper nil the advantages that it will s!
admit of, and affording satisfaction to its patrons. : J-J
In political matters the Courier will lake no ' j!
part; the design being to publish a Paper adapted
to the interest of ai.i., which could not he effected 1
by its entering into the arena of Politics?it will a
be confined principally to such natter as appertains I r'
to Commerce, Agriculture and Amusement. 1?
The COURIER. is published every Saturday '
morning at Three Dollars in advance, or Four a
Dollars if not paid until the expiration ol the year. I

which the teeth of the feeders pass, they can be
made to teed slow or fast to suit the condition of
the cotton at the time. When made double, the
saws arc placed on two sets of cylinders and turn
upon each other in opposite directions, and are
cleansed by two sets ot brushes that have fourrevolutions
to one of twe saw. The two cylinders can
be detached so as to enable the planter to run one
or both at pleasure, although embraced with feeders,
Ac. in one stand. The whole is put in operation
with a drum and hand, as in the ordinary Gin, and 1
may be propelled by horse, steam, or water pow er.
It may also he propelled by iron running gear. .
The force required to work it, is about the same as
that necessary to inovean equal number of saws in
the common Gin. This (Sin has been put in
operation in New Orleans lor two or three weeks,
and its success tested in the presence of a large
number of planters, merchants and others, and,"
received their general approbation.
{Several gentlemen have been so kind as to give!1
the Patentee their written opinion lcspccling the !
merits of the Clin. A number of others could be
added, but the following are deemed sufficient: 1

Dr. A.Jones?Sir, In reply to your enquiry, 1
what 1 think of your improved Cotton Gin, I have J
to say, that I saw it work on Saturday Ihe2i*>th inst. .1

cess, appeared to me to he better and cleaner than 1
from the common Gins in use, and that it saves 1
considerably in labor. Respectfully, Ac. 1

Dr. A. J ones?Dear Sir, in reply to your note,
accompanied by a specimen of tho cotton, ginned
by your Patent Gin, 1 beg leave to observe, that it
exhibits a decided improvement on the usual process
of ginning ; delivering the staple uninjured
and free from Dap or trash, clean ar.d of good co*
lor; thereby giving the article an additional value.
These favorable impressions of the advantages of
your Patent Gin, have been confirmed by subsequently
witnessing it in operation. The utility of
the double cylinders and saving of labor, will be
readily perceived and properly op, reciated by the
intelligent planter.
Feeling a deep interest in llie success of all improvements
tending to benefit the important staples
of our country, I trust that yours will meet with
the encourageuu lit it justly merits.

foreman in the house of Messrs. Lewis, Williams

Cotton Gin in operation, and have examined the
cotton ginned by it, and pronounce it better cleansed,
and the staple less injured, than any cotton
that ever came under my observation. It is completely
ready for the breaker without the aid of the
lower, and would, therefore, save the first process
