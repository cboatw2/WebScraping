THE GRASSES. s
1. The Dairy.?It is well known that j
Charleston, Savannah, Augusta, Columbia,
and ail our large towns in the South, are but!
scantily supplied either with good milk or i
fre^h butter. A number of families in ! j
Charleston make a comfortable nupport by i
keeping four or five cows each, purchnshing s
the gross which is brought from the country, \
and selling milk. When the cows become f
dry, they are sold to the butchers and others i
are pure ;ased. ?
I would proposo that the following ex- r
periment be made by some enterprising, in- s
dustrious man, who is not ashamed of his t
profession, and will taken pride in attending f
- personally to his business.? ' t
L'*l a farm of one hundreJ and fifty acres c
be procured in the vicinity, of from three to |
six miles of the ci'y. Let this farm b* di. r
vided into suitable lots for the cultivation of ^
grasses and vegetables to serve as foo I for |
the cattle. Let one fi'-U be p'anted in \
herd's grass (Ductylusglomerala,) which an- c
swi-rs our ciitna e very well, ns I have had t
II flourishing in my garden tor the last ntteen i j
years, and have frequently cut it as early as L
February. I would prefer p'anting the a
roots, which are easily divided, setting then. \
oat a foot or eighteen inches apart. The t
seeds vegetate preny well, but the plan s c
when young are often destroyed by more jj
luxuriant grasses. Let a small field be
planted with the roo:s of the G irna grass. I n
is very productive; cuttle, alfliough they do b
not prefer it at fir.?t, soon grow fond of it, a
and they do no: seem at any lime to refuse u
it when made into hay. Let alternate fields y
of oats, barley and rye, be sown in drills. %
and at the same time sowing broad cast c
over some of these fields about twenty n
pounds of Indian or common rye grass to u
the acre. Another field should he devoted e
to the cultivation of the common Guinea ja
grass, which although it comes rather late s
in spring, is-very productive, and lasts till
killed by the frost?Jof autumn. A small bed g
left for s?ed, covered during winter with s

* which should be sot out in rows eighteen | t
inches apart and the plant standing eight or j <
ton inches in the row. Another field set i v
out in the saitie manner with Egyptian mil- I
let (Pennisetum, liphouleurn,) one of the ji
most productive grasses in the world, grow- r
ing easily from the seed, and is thoroughly t
naturalized to our climate. Other fi 'Ids I ?
would have successively planted in vegeta- |
bios not for fhe market but for the cows, j
These roo s should be composeJ ofturnips, ; J
Ruta B <gn. Koh rabbi, sugar .beet, carrots, j (
&c. Teus an abundance of green food and t
vegetable's would l>e successively furnished j
for every month in the year.
On this farm 1 would build extensive and |
airy, but not expensive stables, to secure the ?
cattle against the cold of winter?and what ?
is far more injurious, the heat of summer. -t
The builJings should be so arranged that in , y
o i
summer the air may have a freecirculat on. t (
Let forty or fifty cows among the best of the (
common breeds of Carolina be purchased; ,
these may average about forty dollars per ' (
head. Keep among them a young bull of (
the superior English breeds. A stock may !?
thus be-provided in a few years adapted to |
our climate. Importations of grown cattle
for our lower country are not advisable, as j |
not one out of five survived two years, I
whereas those raised here do not seem to de- '
venerate, and arc as well adantsd to our cli- !
" ' - I
mate ns the common variety.
Let the cows be housed all the year, and j <
only be allowed to go out occasionally for j *
exercise. Let their food be carried to them |
as in most parts of England, Belgium and ?
Holland. They will be cooler in the stables J I
than when exposed to the hot sun ; ourcows '
kept in confinement in Charlesion thrive
better than those that are turned out.
The manure and litter from the stables
will after the first year go far to keep the j1
land enriched. <
Lnt careful attendants be provided for the !
^ cattle, and light carts used to convey the
milk or fresh butter to market mornii>g.and j
evening. It is not my intention to estimate
the profits of such an establishment, yet I
cannot but think tint it would be infinitely ;
greater than that produced by any farmer |
in the vicinity of our city who has not invested
a larger capital.
Should the above be regarded as a visionary
scheme I would only ask not to be
condemned before the experiment has been !
tried and failed. . |

turage adapted to our southern climite as
renovaiion of the soil.
The old method ofcultivating the same
field with cotton for a succession of years,
and another with corn, until the lands ore
worn our, has been long tried, and the result
has been destructive to the best interests of
the planter. His lands are nearly worn out,
and he has the prospect of leaving to his pos
lerity a ruinous farm house, decayed fences,
meagre cattle, and a barren soil. It is a
murderous system against which the earthcries
aloud for forbearance, and which the
roice ofexperience unhesitatingly con Jemns.
Even Balam's nss stopped to remonstrate
Yvhen he was overworked. It is treating
jur kind and teeming mother with ingratiude
and cruelty?demanding, like the E?yptian
task masters, bricks without straw?
labour without rest. We have been experimenting
on the fable of the golden egg, and

Whilst wo are furnished with such large
ilantations, it sterns hard that our poor cat!e
should be suffered to pick up a scanty
mbsUtence and waste tneir manure in the ]
voods. We have a sufficient number of

Iruinings of the richest vallies. Even in
his particular a benefit has, in some instanys,
been found in cither suffering the rice
and to rest for a year, or alternating the
rop. A highly intelligent and successful
ilanter of Wacc^maw informed me, that he
jad two years ago not planted a portion of
lis land in ri *p, but suffered the volunteer,
>r rod rice, to spring up. It was ploughed
mder; n portion of the land wa3 cultivated

iro for cattle. In this way his land was in
i measure freed from red rice?he was
>ountifully supplied witn miik and butter, and
he product of his rice-fiolJ was on the suc:ecding
year one fourth more productive
han formerly.
V^e have in Carolina several species of
istive grasses, that have already been
rought into cultivation, especially ue crab
nd crow foot. These, however, are ann.
als, and the ground requires to be every
ear cultivated and manured. The fox-tail
;rass, elymas or lime grass, and many spec's
of poa, festuca, and panicum, aro the
iative products of our fields. From some
?f these, nnd inany others that I have not
numerated, a selection might be made as
n experiment, which, in the end, could
carcely fail of success.
But I would prefer making use of those
;rassos that have been already found to be
tuccessful in agriculture. The clover and
imothy I have reason to fear, are not adipted
to our dry, sandy soil. On the various
tpecics of grasses cultivated in Europe,
vhich I have alread) enumerated, especialy
those of the south of France and Austria,
ts well aft Italy, no experiment has been
nade. I doubt whether the Italian rye
jrass has over been seen in the southern
States, and scarcely in America, although I i
nve a faint recollection of seeing a lew
ilants, some years ago, on the farm of
fudge Buol near Albany in New.York. A
:rop of oats, or rye, after the corn or cotbn,
would ufford a sufficient shade for the
grasses to vegetate, and after the spring
;rain was removed, would not only afford
toy or pas urnge for cattle, hut renovato the
toil and prepare it for the production of our
staple articles. By this means our land
ind our stock of cattle would be improved?
ve would he less dependant on strangers
or our hay, meats, and butter, and in the
;nd our cotton and corn crops would be
nore abundant. It is but fair that we rereive
from our New. England brethren their
rotton cloihs in exchange for our raw ma.
erial, and their flour for our rice, but it is
rather a reflection on our industry and enterprise
when we look to them also for our
hay and bu tor.
THE EARLIEST NOTICES OF SILK*CULTURE OF
THIS SEASON.
It is yet too early to know much of sue.
rossful operations in rearing silk-worms this
season, because few such arc yet fully com.
ploted and the results ascertained, and none
in a large scale. But it is not too soon to
have heard of many disasters and losses, and
L-ven of total failures of rearings attempted
with insufficient preparation and means.
Scarcely one experimenter in twenty has
been properly provided to guard against the
usual changes of weuther and usual degree
of inclemency; and much less so in regard
lo this season, which, to this date, June 17th,
has been generally very unfavorable to silk
culture, owing to the predominance ofcitlier
cold or rainy, o* cloudy and damp weather.
Indeed, the weather of the months so far
have boon almost reversed, or each month
having the weather that properly belonged
to the next preceding or succeeding. In
February, the weather was warm and clear
enough for the usual warm parts of March;
and the young multieaulis trees generally
were in leaf m the tide water region some
weeks before the usual time. In March
these first leaves were generally killed, and
there was severe frost, and ice. In part o!

April there was very wurm weather, which
either caused too early hatching of silkworms'
eggs, where not safely and properly
retarded in ice houses, or invited new expo,
riinents to hatch out their main broods, as
forsettled warm weather. Again, in May
more than two.thirds of all the days were either
cold, cloudy, showery, or of settled
rain. Even in June, so far, with some very
warm days, there have been several others
requiring fires for comfort.
Every person who has had the slightest
experience of the rearing of silk-worms
must know that it is necessary to be able to
protect them from cold, and still more from

should they be able to withstand much eX'J
posure, and yet be healthy and productive!
in spite of all neglect and ill treatment, that
it is true economy to use effectual means to
shut out damp air, and, in bad weather, to
dry, warm, and renew the air of the feeding
apartment, by using a little fire in a fire
place, or a stove. Yet almost all have neglected
to observe these necessary conditions
of success, and therefore it is not to be wondered
at that all such feeders have met with
either partial or total failure in broods hatched
in April, or the first days of May. On
the other hand, we have heard of no person
who had a close feeding house, and yet well
| ventilated, and who used fire in the worst
weather, who has not so far done well, excepting
in some partial cases of the use of
bad eggs, or some other well known and
sufficient cause of failure. If every person
who has attempted and failel to raise a
healthy brood this season were separately
examined as to the causes, there is no ques.

to have operated one or more of the follow,
ing insuperable obstacles to full succeess;
viz., eggs from unheal'hy stock?early
hatching apd exposure to the cold and
dampness and frequent and violent changes
of the weather?wet food given during wet
weather and on damp littler?or too close
crowding of the worms, and neglect ofclea.
nmg away their litter. Yet there will be
some persons who have permitted all of
these evils to operate, and who nevertheless '
[ are astonished at their failure, and totally
I discouraged from making new and better
directed efforts.
Many experiments also who have acted
| more judiciously, and still more of those
who have been too fearful of failure to cfcm.
mence any experiment, will be discouraged
by the number of these losses. But there
is no ground for such a conclusion. It is
certain that this business is capable of being
reduced to precise regulation, and conducted
always in the same manner. If, then,
there were a far greater disproportion of
failures compared to successful rearings this
season, it would furnish no argument against
the business as properly conducted, provide
ded there were any well conducted and certainly
successful experiments made in the
same unpropitious season. If indeed but

thod.
Having suffered in one, as well as having
heard of sundry othor cases of such eaily
i disasters, we were desirous of seeing the [
operations of some other persons who had
been more discreet and therefore more sue.
cessful, and accordingly we visited tho cocooneries
of Mr. Curtis Carter of Henrico,
near Ricomond, and of T. S. Pleasants, at
Bellona, between the 6th and 12th of June.
We earnestly recommend to every one who
feels interested in silk..culture, and has
'doubts as to its practicability, to make a simvliar
visit to culturists who have taken some
care, and exercised some judgment, to attain
the end in view. No one can view the operations
of an intelligent and judicious per.
son in this business without seeing and
learning something of value, even though
some errors may also be equally obvious.
Mr. Curtis Carter has done more and ear.
lier to show his confidence in the profit of
silk-culture than any one in Virginia under
similiar circumstances. He commenced
more than n year ago a cocoonery 130 feet
long, 30 wide, and two stories high, which
has already cost him more than 84000, and
which he does not consider finished until it
shall be supplied with stoves and Hues, and
is lathed and plasted, to preserve the dryness
* ' i L
and warmth of temperaiure thus lo oe oo.
tained. Mr. Carter is not an enthusiast.
He is a prudent and judicious old man, who
has earned by his own early labor and cco.
nomy a competent fortune, wiihout nbandj
oning the habits of industry and frugality,
| and plainness of his comfortable living,
which were necessary in his early life. His
prudence and caution are nppnrent in his
present operations. For after being so well
proviJed, and at such great expense, he has
still avoided increasing his rearings otherwise
than very gradually. lie took care
not to hatch out many eggs until recently,
and the early small broods, (of which he wa s
then roeling some of the cocoons,) were
raised mostly in his close brick hatching
apartment, where fire served to securo a
sufficiently warm, dry, and purified atmosj
pherc. Though 10 ounces of eggs had then
been hatched, most of the worms were as
yet young, and his great cocooucry seemed
almost vacant.
Reeling was then going on, upon two iron
Piedmontcse reels. The laborers were

principal material used had been the la:

During our visit, the reeliog'was of cocoon
of this yeaFs product. We are not able t
judge of this operation by comparison, or b;
acquaintance with the article prepared; bu
lo our scant lights on the subject, it seemei
that the Execution was easy and rapid, an<
the product excellent. Those who conside
the difficulty of reeling as the great Qg ob
I stacle to silk-culture, will have that impres
sion entirely removed by seeing the opera
tion here.
It is not our purpose to describe the par
ficulars of Mr. Carter's leeding operations
which, indeed, there was not time to observe
carefully. He, as well as other persons tc
be mentioned, promised to furnish, for th<
Farmers1 Register, detailed statements o
results, having especial regard to the labor
the cost, and the products.
Mr. Schermerhorn's cocoonery bein$
immediately on the route, was also visited
H:s building is 70 feet by 30, and of two sto
ries. It was specially built for this purpose
The warming, in worst weather, is as ye
but insufficiently nnd unequally effected by
a small common stove. An additional build

hatched out the worms from 30 ounces o
eggs, and they so far were in good condition

fear a failure on account of that error, whicl
so many others have also committed. Will

broods. Of these, about 70,000 worm:
were in their last age of feeding, and som<
eight or ten small separato broods had fin

were then laying eggs. About 200,00(

credit for the success of these early opera
(ions, are indeed not Mr. Pleasani's but be
long to his sister.in. law, Miss D. Brooke
who has given to the rea ing her continue!
and untiring care and labor. Seeing he
success with these early and various sru&
broods, (which caused so much the mor
difficulty, added to the generally opcratin{
difficulties of the weather,) induced us t
beg that the like assiduous attention migt^
be bestowed on a single an:l larger broo<
and in a later and bolter season. We hop
to be enabled hereafter to report the resu
j of this rearing, which will be carefully oh
| served and all the facts noted, in accordanc
with our suggestion and request.
One of the objects of Mr. Pleusants, i
the early part of the season, (the best fc
the purpose in view,) is to provide eggs (
all the best known varieties of silk worm.1
and of healthy stock, and likely to produc
healthy progeny; and this can only be sect
red by breeding from a healtlil;; stock. Th
j was the cause of his having so many diffi
rent kinds of worms, and kept in geparui
| and distinct lots. Much has already bee
j lost by many individuals, from their own q
; norance on this subject, and mu< detrimei
caused to the progress ofsilk-cu Iture. Eve
the best informed and most experience
persons have yet much to lear D on th
j branch of the subject. Veryfo\? persoi
j take the care necessary to produce perfect
i good eggs, or know what means should I
used to retard their hatching afterward
without injury to the vigor of a before hca
thy stock. It is a remarkable fact that ti
j constitution of a diseased or fccblo broc
of silk-worms will certainly be transmits
to the next generation, even thougli the egj
; shall hatch as well as of the host. We a
j further induced to believe that pi neglect!
i nnrt mnrh pvnosed anil sufferin 2 brood
. worms, though not thereby rendered ui
healthy themselves, will lay eggs, which w
produce only a diseased and wo rthless pr<
geny. Mr. Pleasants operations in tl;
respect are conducted with a de. jree of ca
and of rigor, which has been ra jely if ev
used in this country; and not only woi
he reject the whole of a diseased brood, b
of broods generally healthy, fir it every su
pected worm is rejected, next every soft
otherwise inferior cocoon, and finally eve
feeble or inferior moth, shouldi any su
appear af:er the previous rigorous mode

can lead to the result, he will scarcely I

le of retarding the hatching to any time of the
jt season, and yet preserve in perfection the
>f vitality and the health of the stock.
The larger apartment at Bellona, already
s fitted up for the regular feeding, and soon
o now to be occupied Dy silk-worms, is 36 by
y 31 feet, and will furnish accommodaiions
it for 400,000 silk-worms at a time Mr. Pled
asants designs to hatch out 100,000 every
d 10 days until lutein September. One such
r supply has been already hatched, in addition
to the more advanced lots above named;
and the eggs for the next succeeding brood
have been taken from the ice.
So far no particular facts have been stated
. of feeding operations except such as we
?I - r
, saw, in some one or omcr suige ui prw^ress.
3 In addition, we have been informed of sev.
> eral large, successful and altogether satis?
; factory rearings, in Brunswick, Amelia,
f Nottoway, Goochland, and in Norfolk
, county; though to the account from the last,
were added statements of numeroOS loses
; having been suffered by reliance on discas.
ed or damnged sale eggs. We had ami
cipated this result from having obtained and
. made early trial of a small supply from tho
t same source. From those experimenters
who observed and noted their operations
with sufficient accuracy to show the fuels
f and their value, we hope to have reports of
I the results; and especially as to the amount
f of labor employed, and other costs, and the
products actually secured. We shall not
s attempt to anticipate any of the reports by
r partial and probably inaccurate statements
i of what we have heard of them?or even
i of what we have seen. But as it may yet
i be in time to guard others from disaster and
3 loss, we will merely here remark, that all
the observations made concur in showing
) that among the things absolutely necessary
, for success, are plenty of fresh and renewed
- air, enough space for the worms, and clca>
ning of the shelves so often as to prevent
' any accumulation of damp or fermented
s litter at any time, and still more frequent
i cleanings during the last days of feeding.
And, though not so fatal in effect as neglect
i of those essential requisites, we will add as
) things to be avoided, the almost universal
3 errors of feeding too heavily, and the use
3 of very young, very luxuriant and succulent
J leaves, forming a very watery and therefore
weak food, and serving to produce or ins
crensc dumnnes*. which is the greatest of
all causes of injury to silk-worms,

It is not unusual for each to derive arguments
from the fate of other Republics
whose scattered wrecks have heretofore derided
the hopes of humanity. Impartial

which onceflouriahed in the states of Holland
and the Republics of Modern Italy, have all
been subverted. Y**t Rome and Greece, Holland
and Venice, Florence and Genoa, retained
their liberties and with them' their
prosperity and glory for a long succession
of years. If it be nevertheless urged that
