STATE OF THE FINANCES,
T THE CLOSE OP THE tAST ADMINISTRATION.
Treasury Department, )
March 2, 1841. j
In pursuance of a suggestion by the
resident, the Secretary of the Treasury
ibmits, with his resignation, a general
atenient of the fiscal operations of his
enartment. since the last annual reDorti
i order to show its condition till the close
* his connection with it.
So far as yet ascertained, the ordinary
cpenditures for the year 1840, have,since
at- report, proved-to be less than those
1839 by , the amount then estiated
of between two and three millions
dollars.
The revenue has turned out, also, to be
iarly the same, as then calculated, makg
in the actual result?though affected
fluctuations in imports almost unexamed?little
or no variation from the estiates
in 1839, beyond what has been the
rerage annually, for the last quarter of a
;ntury.
The available balance of money in the
reasury, at the commencement of 1841,
eluding, as was before computed, what
Dod to the Treasurer's credit with collators.
receivers, and the Mint, subject to
aft, has proved to be about as was antipated
in December last.
The only material difference, and which
is been since explained to the proper
nunittce, was caused by some new
arges imposed by Congress, through
w appropriations, which would otherisc
have fallen on 1841, and some fades
by the indebted banks to pay so
uch in 1810 as was expected.
The power remaining on the first of
nuary to issue Treasury notes, consulted
another of the fiscal means for the
csent yean, and it has been ascertained
exist in ap amount somewhat greater
an had been estimated. ,
Hence the present year commenced
ith resources on hand quite equal to1 the
ticipations previously formed The difrences
before named were, fortunately,
a character not to change the fiscal
ndition of 1841?as in proportion to
sir respective amounts, the receipts in
at year will probably be larger,- and
3 expenses smaller.
But notwithstanding thie, it wasdeemivery
important, as detailed fully in the
nual report, to ootain at an eany uay
i aid of some subsidiary means, with a
jw to guard against fluctuations and
niingencics generally, as well as to
ualize the receipts and expenditures
ring 1841, the latter being likely to fall
ry heavily on the first quarter of it.
Accordingly, as had been done on some
nilar occasions since the public debt
is discharged, and the current revenue
nin;shed, these means were requested
the Department the first moment pracablc
after the session1 began, being, in
s annual repurt itself- The additional
mmunications. in this and'other years,
ging a compliance with such requests,
3ie made only to develope new factsid
reasons, which had in the mean time
curred, favorable to the previous remmendations.
'
Although the aid was not in this instance
rnished as early as desired, yet the Dertment
has succeeded in commanding
funds so effectually as with the existing
sources on the first of January, and the
rrent receipts afterwards, to meet all
e authorized claims that were due and
esented during the severe pressure extrie
need in that month.
Since the desired aid was furnished by
e passage of the new act concerning
reasury notes, in February, no necessity
is arisen to issue any of them, solely
ith a view to defray claims already pay>le.
But in consequence of the public
nvenienco beinsr much Dromoted- bv
ivances of money for pensions, before
ey would fall due, on the 4lh of March,
ose advances have been made; and annount
of notes under the new act has
msequently been issued, equal to about
300,000. This is not so great by $150,)0,
as the sum which has already been
rwarded on account of those advances.
6 greater amount for any purpose, and
obabiy not so great as that difference, is
rely to be called for before the 4th inst.
ence it appears that the other available
cans in the Treasury have, as yet provi
more than enough, in the aggregate, for
ie discharge of allengageme^tsof every
ind sanctioned-Dy congress, wiicmcruiu
r new, in arrear, or otherwise, which
re re due, and have been presented for
ayment.
It may be proper to state further, that
je receipts, since the year commenced,
ave fully sustained the computation for
le whole of the first quarter, made by
te Department, in January last. The acruing
revenue from duties payable three
nd six months hence, has been much
irger in January than would be required
it" ' ' V-.-v

monthly to make all the receipts from tha
in 1841 equal the antodnt estimated in thi
annual report.
. The revenue received in February, no
yet fully ascertained, has probably beer
nearly the same asin the preceding month
but the accruing duties are believed tc
have been considerably less. It is com
puted, however, that these duties, taking
both months together, have been quite as
large as would be their proportion in ordei
to make the receipt for the whble year,
from this source, eaua1! to' the annual p?t;.
mate/ Nor have the expenditures since
the year began varied materially from the
amount expected ft is gratifying to be
able to add, that, after all the payments
above described, the balance of available
money now in the Treasury is more than
a million of ck>lliir^?iclo?fing^ what stands
subject to draft, and to the credit of the
Treasurer in the mints, andf with collectors
and receivers. Deducting trust funds
of every kind, which have seldom been so
small in amount, and none of Which that
should be invested fem?un uninvested, the
balance will still exceed three-fourths of a
million.
During the last three months also, as
well as in all the former exigencies, since
irniir A rlmmictJ aL.? a
yvui xiuiiniiwuauuu VUllJIIICUCCUf llll&l
balance has never been less than from
half a million to a million of dollars, however
much the Treasury may, at times,
have been exposed to embarrassment at
particular points, in the various crisis to
which its affairs have been exposed, in
the performance of such large distant, Oncertain,
and sometimes unexpectedjoperations.
But any good fortune in preserving
high and scrupulously the pecuniary
credit of the General Government, under
such perils, should? not be suffered to impair
the force of the recommendations
that have from time to time been submitted
to Congress for tt provision of additional
means,-to guard well against sudden
deficiencies in receipts and Targe fluctuations
and inequalities between them and
the expenditures in different parts of the
year.The
first recommendation for some
such precautionary measure was presented
as long as 1835, immediately after the
discharge of the national debt, and the
termination of the necessity for keeping
a la*go WJaiTCe' on hated to aid in defraying
it.
The attention' of Congress has since
been annually invited to the subject with
earnestness and ih several different forms.
In respect to out* present financial condition,
judging from1 that part of the year
already expired, and from the existing
means on hand, tfttere appears to be no
danger of embarrassment, unless it is hereafter
caused by the circumstances pointed
oft in the last annual report.
Should Congress, before the expiration
of the present session, or before the year
closer, burden tfhe Treasury with a much
greater amount of appropriations than
were called for in December last, the ex*
pected means of defraying them; as then
explained, may prove proportionably inadequate.
So a continued suspension ol
specie payments, by most of the banks
west and southwest of New York, would
lessen the receipts of the Treasury, as
was then also stated. The sudden suspension,
again, of several 'of those banks,
in February, after resuming for a short
time, has already exercised some malign
influence on the reviving business of the
country; and this circumstance was im
mediately submitted to the consideration
of the appropriate committee.
But though it may continue to operate
unfavorably or* mercantile credit, there is
nevertheless no good reason to doubt that
if the appropriations are not ineveafcec
beyond what was called for in the tmnua
estimates, the means now on hand, witf
the current receipts and the existing power
to issue five millions of Treasury note;
after the third of Mart-qh, wiJI prove amplj
sufficient to meet all ordinary engagements.
If they do not also enable the
Department to extinguish the whole of the
temporary indebtedness caused by the issuse
of these notes, it will be owing tc
the recent and1 unexpected suspension
again of many of the banks, so sensiblj
injuring the prospect for increased business
which existed to a very flattering extent
early in December.
But Congress having not yet passed
appropriations exceeding, in the aggregate,
the whole estimates, no serious dangei
seems to exist, unless some future action
of that body,- during the residue of the
year, should augment the expenditures.
Nothing, of course, is easier than the
adoption of measures which must increase
the expenses of 1841, so as to exceed its
authorised fiscal means, and thus not onlj
to cause embarrassment, but impair the
pecuniary credit of the General Government,
and leave no alternative excep'
greatly increased taxation of some kind
lor a permanent national debt
^??B
tf But it is a matter of congratulation that
e these financial evils have hitherto beerf
avoided, though severe commercial cont
vulsions, protracted Indian hostilities/and
i a periodical redaction of the revenue
, from customs, have at times pressed hea>
vily on our operations.- Without doubt
they can be longer avoided by a continued
r reduction in the public engagements,
i through perseverance in economical re*
trenchment, and the careful Shunning of
, causes for new or increased expense/ Jn
deed, it must be a source of sincere sa'tisr
faction to the President, personally, as
well to the community at large, to see his
i administration close \Vithout the creation
i of any permanent public debt whatever,
f or even of a temporary one, that might
not be discharged within the year, if provinnr

ed, without any increase of taxes; but, on
the contrary, many old ones reduced?
r without any claims due and authorized by
t Congress and the accounting officers,
which have not, as a general rule, been
paid with specie or its equivalent, and
with promptitude,- however much the 0epartment
hcfe been infcomfnoded by revulsions
irf commerce and \>aokj3uspension9,
and, in fine, without a Treasury either
empty or bankrupt, but its obligations in
high credit, and the means in its control,
probably, enough to discharge in the usual
manner and extent, throughout the ^ear,
every expenditure that has yet been sanctioned
by Congress, 01 requested by yourself
or this Department.

'IflJPORTAKT APPARATUS FOR RAILWAVS.
-r*A notice appears in the Railway Times
of. an apparatus which seems likely to
contribute essentially to the safety of railway
travelling. It is a plan for'enabling
the guard of a train (genererally a Very
intelligent officer,) to communicate with
the engine driver for the purpose of stopping
the trai?. The contrivance consists
of a wrought iron or copper "tube fixed
under the centre of each carriage, and
Massing under the tender to the engine.?
n each of these tubes is inserted a metallic
rope, every separate division being
connected By ropes of 4ess strength, vVitn
catctFhooksrat both ends, so contrived
. that they, may be attached or detached in
a very few seconds. The one end of
the rope is connected with a whistle upon
the engine, and the other, by means of
certain simple machinery, passes up to
I the seat of the principal guard on the top
of any particular carriage, and is so arranged
that by the turning of a winch,
the steam is let in upon the whistle already
referred to, the sound of which can only
be stopped by the act of the driver. The
sound of the whistle differs, of course,
from that in ordinary use. The advan1
tages tcr be expected from the efficient
1 working of an apparatus of this kind are
too obvious to require enumeration. Hith1
erto there have been no certain means of
' communication between the guards and
' the persons upon the engine.

til at last, his suspicions rested on one of
his neighbors. Accordingly, as the sheep
disappeared, one was entered on the book
against the suspected man, and the price
carried out. At the end of a year, the
I bill was sent to him; and without making
f any words on the subject, he prudently
" paid it. Another year passed, and the
i absence of a great number of sheep had
'' added numerous items to a new bill, which
was presented as oil the year previous.?
i This time, however, the lover of mutton i
! demurred; and insisted on its being re;
duced; protesting that he had not taken
an eighth part of the number charged to
! him. But the creditor insisted upon every
farthing. "Well," said sheepy, "if I must
