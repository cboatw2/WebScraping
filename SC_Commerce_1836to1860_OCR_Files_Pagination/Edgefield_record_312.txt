THE DROUGHT-A DRY FOUNTAIN.
There is, or was, in Florida. a beautiful

Es. of Elbert county, writes us undei

Oliver, of this county, has three Negroe!
that picked out 1,343 his. of Cotton on the

Elbert 497, and Rachel, a girl 15 years old,

We should pronounce the above to be v

A Pattern of Gentleness.-Mrs. T.
Sheridan," writes Lewis, frmn ltverary,
on one occasion, "is also here at present,
very pretty, very sens-ible. amiable, and
gentle; indeed, so gentl that Tos insistt
upon it that her extreme quietness atl
traniquility is a defect in her character.
Above all, he accuses her if such an ex.
treme apprehension of giving trouble (he
says,) it aniounts to absolute afl'entation.
He allirms that. when the cook has forgot
ten her duty and' no dinner is prepared,
irs Sheridan says "Oh! prav dont gel
dinuer on purpose for me; I'll take a dist
of ten instead;" and lie declares himisell
certain tht, if she were to set her cloches
on fire, she would step to the hall ver3
quietly, and say to the servant wilth grea
geneleness andcopinosure, '-Pray Williaui,
is there any water in the house!" "No,
Madam, but I can soon get sone!" '-Oh
dear, no; I dare say the fire will go out ol
itself."
Whe'n we hear a man boasting of hi!
"ilow' for the dear people," weare strongly
itielined to suspect him of a -'love lor the
people's" offices.-It reminds us of the
Irishmwin who was about to marry a girl
