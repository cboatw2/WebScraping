, tous, though most lightly entertained, even by
minds of reason and reflection. I have a more dis
tinct recollection of the impression left by the book,
than of the book itself. 1 should like, greatly, to
meet with it again: have made several inquiries for
it, but in vain.
What an important auxiliary it would be, for the
travelling preacher, to render touching and effec- ‘
tive, his homilies on the awful subject of death, to
the young and healthy and thoughtless inmates of
the houses of his pastoral visitations 1 Here, they
would see, (for there are plates illustrative of each
narrative,) as well as read for themselves, that nei
ther age, sex, nor condition is spared by this “insa
tiate archerand that no state nor condition of
life, affords any protection against the unerring en.
ergy of his fatal dart; and while it would neither
have the tendency to disgust with life, nor unfit for
its duties, it would give the important subject of
death, wholesome room in the mind ; and the “Be
ye also ready,” (the practical exhortation and com
ment,) producing the fruits of a well-ordered life
and godly conversation, and inducing the Christian
pilgrim to “ walk thoughtful, o’er the dark and sol
emn shore of that vast ocean, he must sail sosoon.”
A few stanzas, composed at the time, may farther
serve to illustrate the impression of that work, on
a then very youthful and worldly mind.
ON PERUSING THE WORK CALLED
“DEATH’S DOINGS.”
The pleasure I lov’d, and the mirth I ador’d,
The jest I applauded, the song I encor’d,
Have lost all their sweetness and joy unto me,
Nay, from them my sick heart most gladly would flee;
For Death is now ever between me and all,
He stalks at the play-house, he strides at the ball;
He sneers in the jest, and he shrieks in the song,
No where can I ’scape him, he’s ever along.
The face of a friend, ah! behold he is there 1
The voice of a lover,—’tis his that I hear I
The hand of the nearest and dearest, ah! no I
’Tis Death’s cold and bony, I find to my woe.
Where do I not see him 1 in all that is fair,—
A bird or a flowret, behold he is there I
In cheeks that are rosy, in eyes that, are bright,
Behold he is there, ever ready to blight.
Where shall I not find him'! Ah! where, tell me where!
But tell me that place, and I’ll cease to despair,
Where he is all powerless and loses control,
What answer 1 “poor mortal, look into Iky stmlV’

GENERAL INTELLIGENCE.
FOREIGN.
New-York, Sfft. 20.
Three days later from England.—The mag.
ilificent packet ship Victoria, commanded by our
old friend Captain Morgan, has anticipated the
steamers, and arrived yesterday from London,
bringing intelligence three days later than the last
advices. We desire Capt. Morgan to accept our
thanks, not only for London papers to the latest
date, but for his very kind and gentlemanly conduct
towards our News Collector on boarding his ship.
Every attention was given and every facility afford
ed in furnishing us with the earliest and first packa
ges of papers. The Victoria has proved herself a
noble ship, and deserves all the honors bestowed
upon her in London. The Captain feels confident
that she is the fastest sailer afloat, and the extract
from his log seems Co furnish proof of his opin
ion.
The news is interesting. A dreadful fire had oc
curred in London, the particulars of which we give
in a necessarily abriged form from the London pa
pers.
The fire broke out in Tooley street, near London
bridge, aiid in Fetter lane, Fleet street, almost sim
ultaneously, the former being attended with an enor
mous sacrifice of property in the total destruction
of Topping’s wharf, St. Olave’s Church, Watson’s
Telegraph Station, several warehouses and vessels,
moored alongside the wharf, and the latter resulted
in a most deplorable loss of human life.
At nine o’clock a very curious incident occurred
at St. Olave’s church, at which hour two parties,
one by license the other by bans, presented them
selves for marriage, attended by the worthy rector,
Dr. Kenney. After some little difficulty the matter
was arranged by the firemen placing some boards
over the water which was in the interior of the
church, just within the doorway under the southern
gallery, where Dr. Kenny performed the ceremony
in the most impressive manner, notwithstanding the
galleries were then actually on fire, from which the
flames were constantly emerging, and amid the
falling of the burnt timbers from the top of the
church altogether presented a scene the most curi
ous and awful to witness. The ceremony being con
cluded, the parties quickly withdrew, and were
loudly cheered upon their departure by the large
assembly outside.
It is impossible at present to estimate the damage,
with anything approaching to accuracy, but it cer
tainly cannot be less than £50,000.
Arrival of General Esfarteko.—Falmouth,
August 19th.—This morning Her Majesty’s steam
vessel Prometheus, Lieut. Frederick Lowe, com
mander, arrived from Lisbon, having on board Gen.
Espartero, Duke of Victory, and Gen. Van. Halen,
Count of I’ericamps, the late Ministers of War and
the Interior for Spain, and a suite of thirteen per
sons.
The ex-Regent left the Tagus on the 12th inst.
and touched at llayonne, with the hope of meeting
the Duchess of Victory, but not finding her there,
left again on the 16th.
The Prometheus, after receiving a supply of fuel,
has proceeded with her illustrious passengers to
Havre, with the intention of receiving on board the
Duohess.
The ex-Regent was saluted by her Majesty’s
ship Astrea, and waited on officially by Captain
Ellice.
The Boston, an American vesssel, from the South
Seas, brought an account to Rio that the British
frigate Vindictive and Cleopatra sloop-of-war had
refused to salute the French flag hoisted atOtaheite,
which the commander of La Boussole, French
frigate, had remonstrated against.
Bank of England.—The return of the quar
terly average of the weekly liabilities and assets of
the Bank of England from the 20th of May to the
12th instant, both inclusive has been made. Com
paring this return with the previous one from the
22d of April to the 15lh of July, the circulation is
now 19,358,000/. against,19,280,000/., being an in
crease of 78,000.; the deposits are 11,218,0(H)
against 10,724,000., being an increase of 494,000/,
and making the total of the liabilities 30,576,000/.
The securities are 21,890,000/., against 21,462,000/.,
being an increase of 205,000/., and making the
total of the assets 33,7'10,000/., being an increase of
61,000/. during the present month.
The Paris journals of Friday and Saturday have
reached us by our usual express.
The Opposition papers of Friday comment in
* severe terms on the collision with the French
fishermen of Newfoundland, in which one of them
was killed by the fire of an English vessel. The
Constitionncl observes, that even were it true that
those fishermen were within English limits, and
that warnings had been given and disregarded ; the
English corvette had other means to enforce respect
for her rights than by having recourse to the brutal
argument of fire arms. He could have seized on
the delinquents, and have had them tried, instead of
firing upon them.—London Timet.
Cotton.—An unusually extensive business has
been done this week in cotton, both by the trade
and speculators, and the market closes with anima
tion, at an advance of fully l-8d per pound on last
week’s quotations of the current qualities of Ameri
can ; the hotter are also more saleable. Sea Island
continues in demand at full prices. In Egyptian a
considerable business is going on at an advance of
l-8d to l-4d per pound. Brazil is more saleable at
former rates. Surat is in very active demand, ena
bling holders to obtain an advance of l-8d per pound.
The sales of the week amount to47,190 bales in
cluding 9,000 American and 3,000 Surat on Specula
tion, and 750 American for export.
We still continue to experience a large demand
for cotton. The sales to-day amount to 8000 bales,
consisting of Brazils 5 l-8d to 0 l-4d; 300 Surats,
2 3-4d to 3 l-4d; and the remainder American, 2,000
of which are bought on speculation. The market
is very firm, at yesterday’s quotations.—Liverpool,
August 19.
From the Charleston Mercury, September 3*.
Arrival of the Caledonia.—The British Mail
Steamer Caledonia arrived in Boston on Wednes
day morning.
The news by this vessel is interesting and im
portant We have accounts of the visit of Queen
Victoria to France ; of the arrival of Espirtero in
London ; of a further rise in cotton j and of the
close of the Parliamentary session.
The British Parliament was prorogued on the
24th ult., by the Queen, who delivered a speech on
the occasion, which is said to have been very bitter
and decided. Some of the Whig papers report that
she was opposed to going in person to the House,
but that she was prevailed upon to accede to the
wishes of her ministers, in order to show her con
fidence in them. Wilmer &. Smith's European
Times remarking upon this occurrence, says:
The speech itself says little which is not com
mon place, except the portion which relates to Ire
land. In reading that portion of the document, her
Majesty, it is said, raised her voice, and emphasised
a good deal. The terms of the speech, as applied
to that section of the empire, are rather strong, but
if Mr. O’Connell is to be credited, her Majesty sub
stituted “deep concern” for “Indignation” in the
original draft, when speaking of the Repeal agita
tion. The great agitator would seem to have
friends—not to say spies—in high places. He was
the first to announce that the Queen censured her
prime minister, and dismissed him without an invi
tation to dinner, because he introduced her name
into his first speech in the House of Commons,
when he declared his intention of putting down
the agitation by force, without her authority. He
was the first, also, to announce that the ministry
had abandoned their intention of coercing Ireland.
These secrets ooze out, probably, through some of
the ladies in waiting about the court, for the daugh
ters of Eve have a prescriptive right for allowing
their tongues to outstrip their judgment
The loss of the Pegasus appears, on a trial before
a coroner’s jury, to have been caused, like that of
the Columbia, by sailing too fast in a region of dan
gerous navigation. In other words, both vessels
were lost through carelessness.
The proprietors of the Cunard line of steamers
have contracted with the builders of the Hibernia,
at Glasgow, for a new vessel to take the place of
the Columbia.
The Acadia from Boston arrived at Liverpool in
twelve days.
The following is the commercial article in the
European Times:
The last few days have witnessed uncommon an
imation in the Liverpool Cotton Market, produced
by the unfavorable accounts which came to hand
on Wednesday, by the Acadia, respecting the new
crop. On the arrival of the news also at Havre,
the cotton market was thrown into great activity.
A considerable advance has been the result, and an
enormous amount of business has been transacted.
Apart from this, however, business generally wears
a more healthy appearance than it has done for
some time past, and confidence is reviving.
During the last week Cotton, to the enormous
quantity of 62,000 bales, has changed hands—half
on speculation, the other half to the trade. Prices,
in some instances, have advanced as much as a
farthing, in every instance an eighth per lb., which,
making every allowance for the news brought by
the steamer, is considered somewhat extraordinary,
when there is at present on hand a stock very lit
tle short of a million of bales. Contemporaneous
with the Acadia’s advices, the manufacturing dis
tricts have been experiencing a revival, ana both
circumstances have conspired to produce that ex
traordinary excitement in the market which has
just been witnessed. The trade of Manchester is
at the present moment in a state of greater activity
than it has been for some years past and all the
monthly circulars published in that town describe
the activity to be general. But the improvement
is not confined to Cotton alone—the Woollen, Iron
and other trades have received an impetus. For
eign orders from various parts of the world are com
ing in: but what is still better, as indicating a per
manent improvement, the home trade is in a far
more prosperous state.
This favorable state of affairs is the result of ex
tensive orders from Russia, India, the Levant, and
Germany, while the orders for English Manufac
tured goods received from the United States, espe
cially the southern parts, are said to be encouraging.
The last Levant mail brought Constantinople let
ters of the 17th. The Porte seemed inclined to
pursue an anti-Christian course of policy. The
massacre of the Nestorians had caused great sensa
tion. Izzet Pacha had been appointed to inquire
into the disturbances of Bosnia. Accounts from
Erzeroora were not satisfactory. Negotiations
were suspended, and the Persians collecting troops.
The plague had made its appearance.
It had been reported that Queen Victoria and
Prince Albert would visit Paris, but they had deter
mined not to go beyond Eu, and would return to
England on Thursday, the 7th inst.
The arrival of Espartero in London created consid
erable stir, and he was received with great respect
by all parties. He was presented with all due eti
quette to Queen Victoria, by Lord Aberdeen, the
Minister of Foreign Affairs, and at the last accounts
was the guest of Lord Palmerston, the head of the
late Whig admiqistration.
The Prince de Joinville and the Duke d’Auraale,
the two youngest sons of the King of the French,
arrived in England with an invitation to Queen Vic
toria to visit France, and she accepted their invita
tion, and sailed from Southampton on the 28th of
August, for Treport,—from whence she proceeded
immediately to the Chateau d’Eu. This is the first
occasion for upwards of three centuries, that the
sovereigns of the two countries have met under
similar circumstances. The last meeting of alike
nature, was that between Henry VIII. and Francis
I. on the field of the Cloth of Gold, which was fal
lowed, two years subsequently, by a war between
the same monarchs.
The reception of the Royalty of England, by the
Royalty of France, appears to have been cordial,
and the ceremonies were appropriate and impusing.
The landing was made at Treport, a short distance
from the Castle of Eu, on the 2d of September. As
600n as the Royal Steamer, bearing the Queen and
her suite, appeared in the harbor, the King of the
French went on board to receive her, and as he
reached the deck, a grand salute was fired from the
rqmparts and the ships. The steamer then passed
on to the landing, where the Royal Family of
Franco appeared to welcome the Queen of Eng
land, who soon made her appearance leaning on the
arm of the King of the French.
The moment the two sovereigns set their feet on
the quay, the air resounded with crieB of “Vive le
Roi!" “Vive la Reine !” and the band of the Car
abiniere struck up the air of “God save the Queen.”
The King then presented her Majesty to his
Queen, who conducted her to the Pavilion, on
which waved the flags of England and France.—
The King following them at some distance, with
Prince Albert and the Princes and Princesses of the
Royal Family. Her Majesty, after resting awhile
at the Pavilion, received the felicitations of the au
thorities, including the parish priests of Eu and
Treport. After this ceremony was over, the King,
taking Queen Victoria by the hand, retired with
her to the extremity of the Pavilion, and the whole
Court and authorities defiled before them, bowiu
respectfully as they passed. The band of the Car*
abiniers played again “ God save the Queen,” and
the squadron then galloped off in the direction of
the chateau. ' . ,
The eight-horse state-carriage next advanced to
i the entrance of the Pavilion. The King handed in
Queen Victoria and Queen Amelia, who sat by her
side, and then seated himself opposite to her Ma
jesty, with Prince Albert on hisright. The Princes
de Joiuville and Coburg, and the Duke D’Aumale,
having mounted their horses, the ltoyal party set
out, saluted every where on their passage with the
loudest cheers. The suites of both Sovereigns got
into the other carriages, and drove off to the cha
teau.” •
The day before the arrival of Queen Victoria,
was marked by an accident that at one moment
seemed likely to end in the most appalling calamity.
The King and his whole family started from the
Castle of Eu in one carriage, to take their usual
airing.
The carriage was drawn by four very spirited
horses. The party, it appears, happened, in the
course of their drive, to pass through Trepont, a
small fishing village situated amout two miles from
this place, and it happening to be the first time the
Count of Paris visited that place, the loyal inhabi
tants considered it their duty to do their future Sov
ereign especial honor, on the occasion, andthey ac
cordingly saluted his Royal Highness with a feu’de
joie. The guns were fired just as the carriage was
approaching the neighborhood of a bridge which
spans the Brezle, a small river, at the mouth of
which Treport is situated. Nothing could be more
unexpected than the result. The horses, startled
by the noise, commenced plunging furiously. The
postilions lost all command of them, and they dart
ed forward towards the bridge, the parapet of which
the leaders cleared at a bound. The third horse
was dragged after its companions, and for a mo
ment the destruction of the whole party seemed in
evitable; but fortunately the postilion was enabled
to acquire some command over the fourth horse,
and he did not follow. Had he done so, there could
be no doubt of the result. Assistance, however,
was happily at hand, and the whole party were re
leased from their perilous position, not, however, be
fore the traces had been with great difficulty cut,
and the horses, of course, fell into the stream be
low, and were injured, but both the postilions, I be
lieve, escaped.
The National takes advantage of this untoward
event to indulge in its usual abuse of Great Britain.
The other papers merely copy the paragraphs of
The Times describing the occurrence.
The Steamship Acadia on her arrival at Liver
pool, run into the American barque Merchant, of
Newport, R. I.,—the latter sunk in forty minutes,
but the captain and crew were saved. The account
says, “ no blame whatever can be attached to those
in the steamship,”—of course not.
The friends of M. Mendizabel will hear with
pleasure that he has safely arrived at Bayonne. The
Regent, in his visit to that harbour, was accompa
nied by several Generals, among whom were Gen
erals Linage, Osorio, and Van Haten.
The Semaphore de Marselles of the 16th instant
states, that three ships of the line, which suddenly
left Toulon on the 10th, were still within view on
the 14th exchanging signals with the harbour.
They were evidently waiting fresh orders to put to
sea,—a circumstance which gave rise to much con
jecture.-.—The corvette Victorieuse, which was
supposed to have sailed for China, returned to Tou
lon on the 14th from the Islands of llycres. The
corvette Circe arrived at Toulon on the 17th from
Tunis.
Artim Bey, private secretary to the Pasha of
Egypt reached Marseilles on the loth, on his way
back to Alexandria.
The Cologne Gazette publishes a letter from Na
ples of the 7th inst., announcing that the treaty of
commerce which was in progress of negotiation
with Great Britain had experienced serious difficul
ties.—The British Cabinet, it was said, had deman
ded special advantages for her commerce and navi
gation ; but the French Government had declared
that they would oppose any preference given to
Great Britain. The Austrian Government was
likewise soliciting advantages for her navigation and
commerce. The King of Naples appeared favour
able to the German Customs Union.
The Siecle observes that the Prince of Hesse
Cassel, who is heir presumptive to the throne of
Denmark by right of his mother, being about to be
married to the Grand Duchess Alexandria, third
daughter of the Emperor Nicholas, Denmark will
by this alliance become an advanced post for Rus
sia against Europe. “ VVe cannot,” adds the Siecle,
“ suffer ourselves to entertain any illusion as to the
future prospects of Sweden. Russia could not,
without discouraging those who devote themselves
to her service, deprive Marshal Bernadotte of a
crown purchased at the price of all he owed his
native country.
But Charles John being dead (he is now eighty
one years of age,) the rights of Prince Wasa, a
near relative of the Emperor of Russia, will re
sume their consequence of which they were de
prived, to suit another course of policy. Sweden
is one of the gates of the Czar’s Palace ; and if he
does not hold the keys himself, he will only intrust
them to the hands of one devoted to his service.
As long as Russia must traverse Germany in
order to interfere in European affairs, she is but of
little importance ; but when she can approach Hol
land, where the dynasty is devoted to her, through
Denmark, it will be seen that we are not so far dis
tant from the Colossus of the world. It was at
Castiikum in Holland that the French first met and
defeated the Russians.
Spain—The Revolutionary Ministers carry all
before them in the capital.
By a decree dated the 16th, government had de
clared Espartero, and those who signed his protest,
deprived of their rank, titles, and employments.
The Evening Chronicle states, that the Debuts
has telegraphic news from Barcelona of the 29th.
Great disquietude prevailed. Rioters had pulled
down the electoral lists from the doors of the pro
vincial deputation. No troops had arrived, and this
increased the agitation.
Later from St. Domingo.—By the schr. Tropic,
Capt. Smith, the New York Tribune has advices
from the city of St. Domingo to the 1st. inst. The
captain informs that the recent disturbances be
tween the blacks and mulattoes, was little more
than a row between private parties, and was alto
gether an affair among themselves, having nothing
to do with the Government difficulties. It is all
settled. General Reviere has taken a second tour
throughout the Island, has visited all the prisons and
liberated all the prisoners, no matter for what crime
they were imprisoned : the doors were thrown open
and all permitted to go free. Capt. S. did not know
whether Reviere was the President or not, but sup
posed from the above fact that he was. Business
was improving. The price of flour had risen a
great deal.
Cemeteries.—If it were determined that no se
cond interment in the same gave should be allow
ed, the space of ground required for burials would
soon become a source of perplexity ; London and
its suburbs would require thirty three $cres of single
graves annually. Mr. Loudon proposes that graves
should be sunk as deep as wells, and that an inster
tico of earth five feet in thickness should bo inter
posed between the several coffins. At present,
graves in the London comoteries are dug fifteen feet
in depth, and the bodies of lOpoor persons are depos
ited in each. The common charge is 25 shillings
for each coffin or the enormous sum of 45,3751. per
acre.—Athena um.
Dr. Mott.—This eminent surgeon, who is as
much an ornanicnl to his profession as an honor to
his country, has lately been elected an honorary
member of the Royal Academy of Sciences of
Belgium. To receive this honor it is necessary to
have the King’s approbation, which, in the shape of
a royal edict by Leopold, accompanies the diploma
transmitted to Dr. Mott.
Mb. Atmer.—This celebrated American vauftbrj
who has been performing at the English Opera,
under the management of Van Amburg and Titus,
met his death at the Circus of Mr. Batty, in attempt
ing to throw a double somerset, in which instead oi
lighting on his feet he fell-on his neck and was
instantly killed

[Reportad for the Southern Christian Advocate.]
State of the Charleston Cotton Market.
September 26,1843.
The late accounts per steamer Caledonia from
Liverpool, showing a still farther advance on all de
scriptions of Cotton there, have also occasioned a
corresponding advance in this market Sales have
been effected this day, say from 61-2 to 0 cents, be
ing 1-4 advance on the last week’s sales.
New-Orleans, Sept. 18.—The Yei.low Fe
ver.—We have it on the best medical authority
that the fever has clearly assumed the form of ar
epidemic. The cases in private practice are very
numerous, and we are pained to state that our
streets too frequently present tokens of the journey
of mortality to “ the house appointed for all living.’1
The disease has also assumed a more malignanl
type than it presented during the earlier part of the
season. These changes for the worse may be at
tributed in some measure, we think, to the extraor
dinary heat of the weather for the few days lasl
past, and to the extreme virulence of the sun's
rays. July and August have been considered the
hottest months in this climate, but September, thus
far, has outstripped them altogether. We feel it
our duty again to warn the unacclimated of the risk
of an exposure to the sun and the dangers of night
damps. Caution and Temperance are two eminent
preventive practitioners whose diplomas were
made out and signed when the curses of disease
and death fell upon our first parents.

Terrible Storm in Florida.—The Savannah
Republican of Saturday has accounts of a most de
structive hurricane in Florida. The Port Leon Ga
zette of Sept. 15th announces the entire destruction
of that town on the night of the 13th. Every ware
house but one was blown down, and nearly all the
dwelling houses. Atthe Light House, every build
ing but the Light House itself, was destroyed and
14 lives were lost! The loss of property is estima
ted at $250,000. Fears were entertained that
Apalachicola, St. Joseph and Cedar Keys had shared
the same fate. In the neighborhood of Tallahassee
the storm was very violent, and immense injury was
done to the crops. We have as yet but imperfect
accounts of this awful visitation.
Capt. M. C. Robertson, his wife and three chil
dren are among those who perished at the Port Leon
Light House.—Charleston Mercury, September 25.
A Tree of the Olden Time.—Mr. John Sphar,
of East Pike Run township, has a peach tree on his
premises, occupying an eminent position, several
hundred feet from the river. Its venerable form
has buffeted the storms of fifty-five years, and du
ring the lapse of that time, has borne fruit in its
season, every productive year. Mr. Sphar has resi
ded on the farm containing it, since his infancy, and
bears testimony to its age and good qualities—past
and present—Washington (Pa.) Reporter.
Nuiwpfr of Business Men.—According to an
estimate made in the New York Directory Office,
the business men in the principal cities and towns
of the Union, are six to every hundred persons;
and in that city, at the same ratio ; the number of
business men, including all classes, trades and pro
fessions, is now about 19,000 ; supposing the popu
lation of the city proper to be 320,000.
Get rid of tiie Flies.—The flies are more nu
merous and troublesome this season, than we have
ever known them to be before. Yet there is a
simple way of getting rid of them. Half a spoon
ful of ground black pepper, one tea spoonful of
brown sugar, and one table spoonful of cream, mix
ed well together, and placed in a plate, will attract
and destroy flies, without any danger of poisoning
children.
Columbus, (Ga.,) Sf.ft. 21.—Cotton.—It will
be recollected that we quoted the sale of the first
bale of Cotton which was brought to this market
the present season, at 6 3-8 cts. We are happy to
be enabled now to state, from good authority, that
that price has been sustained. Cotton is now sel
ling at from 6 to 6 1-2 cents in our streets,—the
quantities brought in, however, are very limited.
Macon, Sept. 21—Cotton Market.—A few
wagon loads of new cotton are coming in daily. It
brings from 6 1-4 to 6 3-4 cts., very little selling
for under 6 1-2 cents. The planters would do well
to bring their cotton without delay, as our mer
chants are disposed to give full prices.
Fire at Fitchburg, Mass.—The paper mill of
S. S. Crocker, in the western part of Fitchburg toge
ther with store house, &c. belonging to it, was des
troyed by fire on Monday night, the 11th instant.
Loss from $4000 to 5000,—insurance $2000. The
fire was the work of an incendiary.—N. Y. Cour. <f*

Sale of the Buffalo and Niagara Falls
Railroad.—This road, together with the real es

PROSPECTUS
OF THE
EPISCOPAL PROTESTANT.
A Weekly Religious Paper, to be Edited in the City
of Charleston, S. C,
BY VVM. II. BARNWELL,
Rector of St. Peter’s Church.
It has long been thought by some, that a Weekly
Paper, of a decidedly Evangelical and Protestant
tone, is called for among the Episcopalians of our
Diocese,—and the present is conceived to be no
unfavourable time for establishing one.
Whether from a correct, or mistaken sense of
duty, the undersigned deems himself called to as
sume its Editorial supervision. Emolument is, in
no way or degree, the object of the publication,
and should the avails be more than adequate to meet
the expences, they will be appropriated to Mission
ary purposes. The object will be to diffuse and
inculcate through the Press, those vital truths of
the Gospel, which have ever been, since the begin
ning of the Christian Dispensation, the means
made use of by the Holy Ghost, for advancing the
Glory of God, by converting and sanctifying souls.
That these truths have either been nvow’edly re
jected, or virtually obscured by the Church of
Rome,—few Protestants are in the habit of ques
tioning. That they have been undervalued, if not
despised by the advocates of that system, known as
the Oxford. Theology,—is by many conceded,—and
that they are, to a great extent shorn of their beau
ty and power, by the indistinct manner in which
they are brought out, by many professedly Ortho
dox,—is painfully felt. Our aim, then will be, to
'Ot forth, in distinctive contrast, with Romanism,—
Dxfordism,—and a questionable orthodoxy,—the
Doctrines of Grace, as they are declared in the
Holy Scriptures,—and were held and taught at the
Reformation. To promote God’s Glory, and Man’s
test welfare, by upholding Truth, and breaking
lown Error, we conceive to be the duty and privi
lege of every enlightened and sanctified mind,—
and it needs no argument.to show, that the power
of the press, is an important auxiliary in this object.
Nor will it bo deemed beyond the province of an
officiating presbyter to assume, upon his own re
sponsibility, the duties of an Editor when it is re
membered that at his Ordination, he engaged, “The
’Lord lieing his helper,—to be ready with all faith
ful diligence to banish and drive away from the
Church, all erroneous and strange doctrines con
trary to God’s Word.”
In conducting the proposed Journal, while the
entire and exclusive Editorial responsibility, rests
upon the undersigned,—he expects important as
sistance from a number of Clerical and Lay Breth
ren, by the way of communications. But it is to
be one decided feature of the plan:—that each wri
ter will be strictly responsible for his contributions,
so that personalities of all kind, and secret insinua
tions, and anonymous assaults which too often dis
figure the columns of Religious Periodicals, may be
wholly avoided.
.'The Spirit of the paper, while firm and decided,
will, it is hoped, prove thoroughly Christian—glow
ing it may be, with the earnestness of a fervent zeal
for the Divine Glory,—but yet tempered with kind
ness and candor,—in short that spirit, of true love
for God and man, which the Holy Ghost, sheds
abroad into the hearts of prayerful and watchful
believers.
. In controversies, should they occur,—the effort
will be to keep in view principles, and not men,—
and they will be conducted it is hoped in that fair
and courteous manner which becomes the dignity of
Truth, and the holiness of the Gospel. We shall
use with all the ability God has supplied, or may
supply, the best arguments within our reach, to con
vince our opponents,—but we shall rely upon the
influences of the Holy Ghost, applying His own
Truth, to effect this result, and if success crowns
our efforts, to Him, with the Father and the Son, be
the glory all ascribed.
