Dec. 21. Mr. Lion of Missouri intro* '
duced u bill to repeal the distribution act,! ^
and moved to refer it to the Committee ?
on Military Affairs. At the suggestion b
of Mr. Calhoun and .others lie, after some a
time, substituted a Special Committee. (
A debate arose on the question of refer* (
cuce. which lasted till half past three.?- v
Messrs. Linn, Calhoun. Pierce. Buchati* j,

ted the reference and repeal; Mr. Pres.

cussion was left to the opponents of lire 1
bill. If its friends had advocated it, he
thought it would not have passed.. Messrs. n
MungUin. Rives, Archer and Prentiss op- ?
posed the repeal and the reference of the ii
hill to any committee. They snid the ?
proposition was a simple one, well under- :
stood and requiring no iuvestigation.: j,
The motion to refer was 'finally decided t
in the negative, bv a rote-of 17 to 24. -(
The report from the Treasury Department
on the subject of a Fiscal Agency was

insurers of a number of slaves which had 1
breii rescued from a wrecked vc9?elj the l]
Formosa, by British ofticers, carried to a
BriiUii port, and there emancipated; and
thai the company had the money U> pay.
They asked redress from Congress.?
Messrs. Calhoun. Preston, Burrow, King
and Rives all commented upon the con* t
duct of the British authorities in this case v
and in the case oft he. Creole. Mr. Rives
considered the relation *>f the two conn. u
tries precarious, and the danger of war j
great. Messrs. Preston and - Calhoun 1
thought differently, if this country should f
pursue a proper course. They expected 1
justice from the new British Ministry. f
The memorial was refcrud to the Com. '
mittee on Foreigp relations. [
Mr. Preston introduced a hill on the
old subject of the fine imposed on the 1
late J)r. Cooper under the alien an stdi; ?

justice, charged with other tliaa political ,
oli'ences.
