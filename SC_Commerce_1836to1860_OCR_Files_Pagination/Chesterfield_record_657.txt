It is common, immediately after haid
working or travelling in hot weather, t<
O ~
wash horses all over, or to swim them in
water much cooler than their skins 01
their atmosphere. This practice is very
^ dangerous, often ppnlucing colds, fevers,
and frequently fatal chronic complaints,
unless the saine exercise is speedily repeated.
Even the partial application ol
very cold water to parts of the body, oi
the legs, when the horse is much heated,
should be avoided ; for his appearing t<
be gratified by it is no more a proof thai
it is good for him, than the manifest gratification
of a sot in dram-drinking, aftei
hav.ng been drunk, is proof that he i<
henefitted thereby. The poor horse,
which knows no I e ter, experiences pres
ent relief, at the exponse of future sufT
cring that he is incapable of anticipating,
or brute as he is, he would probably reject
it. Rubbing in the shade and lead
ing tnc horse atiout at intervals, constitute
the proper treatment both for farm
and other horses, when much distressed

potatoes, with grasses of various kind:
littt very little oats or rye. In Bclgiui
* l*e chief food of their farm horses consist
.of green clover in summer, and root!
with cut straw in winter. A few oats ar
occasionally given, hut not in so regula
a manner as to give great musculo
strength. They usually go to work e
noon as it is light, continue at it until tei
then rest and feed until Iwy pr tlire
by severe work of any kind.
But all precautions to preserve the
health and vigor of ycur horses will
prove unavailable, unless you pay equal
attention to the kind and quality of their
f<Kwl; the manner of feeding them, anc
also of giving thein water.
Tu ?4tb?*r farm or other horses
to render the utmost service of which
they are capablr, they should l>e fed
wholly on dry food, the grain and long
forage to be old and sound, the first ol
which should l>e ground, and the lattei
chopped in all cases where practicable,
For saddle and carriage horses undei
hard and constant usage oats are liettei
than Indian corn, and that is prcferabk
to every other grain. The blades also,
when well cured, are better than an\
other kind of long forage, as they co-tain
more saccharinu matter. When eithei
farm or other horses are much heated
and great haste is indispensable, no othei
food should Im> given them than a sinal
handful or two of oat-tneal stirred into f
few quarts of soft water, with a I?It It
salt dissolved in it. Before this is given
let their nostrils, inside and out, bt

vinegar and water, if the former can b<
procured, if not, with water alone. Aftei
a very hard ride or travel in harness, the
horse should lie suffered to wallow, l>efor<
any thing else is done to him if linn
and wrather permit, rather titan to he lei
iiiisiB :diately into a stable to be clcanei
and cooled.
Manger feeding with ground grain am
chopjied long forage, is now very gene
rally preferred in England and Belgium
as well as by the best judges in our owi
country, to the old fashioned, most waste
ful way of giving unground grain ii
mangers, and unohopped forage in racks
These last are disused every where, bu
in a few places for green grass; and it
lieu of the rack, wide, deep mnngerw an
adopted, with small iron or wooden bar
fastened acros* them, to prevent the Itor
scs from throwing out their food. It
England the most common food for faru
horses consists of a mixture of bruisei
oats, l?eans, and chaff, in the proportioi
of eight pounds of oats, which are oqua
to about five quarts, (their oats being i
few pounds heavier than ours,) tw
pounds of beans, with twenty of chafl
Thirty five or six |w>unds of such food i
the day's allowance for medium size*
horses while at work, and forty pounds o
it for large horses* Such is the couunoi
allowance during winter, when the horse
arc constantly stabled. Hut from th*
end of April t? the end of July they ar
f usually turned out at night, and the who!
of rest days. Other kinds of food how
ever, are much used by small farmer?
such as barley, unmerchantable wheal

j o'clock, when they resume and continue
i their lahor till six or seven, fa harvest
* j time they work from day-break until
j evening, resting only a few hours in the
t heat of the day. A pair of norses with
! one plough are allowed for every forty
? acres ofarable land, the whole of which
J on an average, is ploughed twice and
' | harrowed three times; besides this they
I cart fodder and manure, and do the hari
I vest work. Both in Belgium and Engj
land, they are moderately watered before
i and after feeding. When not worked,
1 water is given them three times a day,
and always of the softest kind, when it
can be procured. In ordinary travelling,
also, a liberal supply of such water is j
> strongly recommended to t>e given, a j
little at a time, which prevents excessive
' thirst, and a consequent drinking to excess.
This is very dangerous, esj>ecially
to u horse much heated, especially if the
water he very cold.
' In addition to the foregoing condensed
' remarks, taken chiefly from the two exI
I ccllent works already mentioned, permit
j me now to offer such information as 1
I have derived from others, and my own
II long experience as an owner of every
| kind of horse but the race horse, in re.
* gard to the best mode of managing those
most useful animals, in our country. 1 ,
, j will'begin (as the saying is) at the be-I
> ginning.' I1
Colts should always be weaned before
the grass is generally gone, and should he
" put into some enclosure where they can!
not hurt themselves. Their dams should
1 he stabled for a few days, and milked if
their hags swell much. These colts
should never be stabled until broke, nor
much after that before they are full
grown. But they should have well cov.
ered shelters, open to the south under !
which to protect themselves from bad
weather. Plenty of good corn, fodder or
hay in winter, and grass when it comes,
and as long as it lasts, will keep them
I whilst unbroke, in a healthy, growing
I condition, which is far better than keeping
them very fat to force their growth
beyond what is natural; for overgrown
horses, like overgrown men, rarely, if
ever, have hardihood, vigor, and activity
in proportion to their size. In fact, very
large horses are objectionable, for all
j purposes, except slow and heavy drafts.
:J The gentling of colts should commence
, soon after they are foaled, and continue
j until they are backed. Frequent hand*
p J ling, occasional salting or feeding tlicm
r out of your hand, and stroking their necks
, are all good practices. From two or three
years old, they should lie accustomed, by
. degrees, to the saddle and bridle; a light
snaffle is l>cst. Thus treated, the brcakr
ing becomes so easy, that they will rareI
ly play any tricks, and may be soon
* ' k * ' i . i rt>
r I taught, even to siana nre, ov snooung uii
I | a gun or pistol, for a few days, just as
t j they commence eating. In a word, unit
i furmly kind, gentle treatment by their
master, will alwavs make such good, docile,
gentle horses, that they will often
( follow him, like his d'?g, and will manifest
equal regard for his person.
' All the general directions for the treatment
of horses in England wiil suit quite
^ as well for the horses of our own country.
Hut the articles of food being somewhat
[A O
I different with us, I will now add a lew
remarks on that subject. In most of our
States, the chief food for horses is Indian
j corn and the fodder thereof. Both are
usually fed away in the most careless, extravagant,
and wasteful manner?the
corn being given in the ears, and the fodder
bundles, which are thrown united
j into the horse.racks or on the ground.?
Much, then, is wasted by being trampled
j underfoot, and so dirtied that the horse
j rejects it, whilst many of the grains of
corn pass through his body undigested,
and of course, render him no service j
whatever. He also loses all the benefits
of the cobs, which he rarely eats when !
1 whole, although they make an excellent
food, if ground up with the grain. This
^ mode of feeding is much the most general,
' notwithstanding it has been indisputably
I proved bv actual numerous experiments,
* that to give the corn and cob ground to"
?* i. K io II r?, 1 >?/%!> ]% a?m n )? u nrl
" 11 v ' 1 "'IH.I1 >o V.III1V.U ?n?
*. the fodder chopped in a cutting-box, not J
s only saves more than enough to pay the ;
j extra expenses of grinding and cutting,
(j but actually keeps tho horse in better
condition than the same quantity of corn
and fodder given in the usual way. j
Moreover, it is a cheaper food than any I
other of which grain, cither whole or
e crushed, forms a part. Take oats, for cxe
ample, which are the most common,
* where com is not used, and let us esti5?
male the former at forty and the latter at
U sixty cents a bushel, which 1 think a fair
d general average in the States wherein
s, corn is a staple crop. Now as only halt
n the cob hominy is grain, the mixture will
[s c??st or ly thirty cents a bushel, and is generally
deemed fully equal in nutritive
e qualities to a bushel of oats. If these also
he crushed, we must ad 1 about four cents
to their cost, and the difference between
the two kinds of ground food, (the chopped
fodder being the same in both cases,)
| with about fourteen cents per bushel, in
ltJ j fuvoi of cob-hominy. Suppose, thai} that
one gallon three times a day, is enough,
as experience has proved it to he, for an
ordinary sized horse, with eighteen or
twenty bundles of fodder, the saving in
one week, by feeding with cob-hominy,
will be a fraction over thirty six cents, or
nearly nineteen dollars a year for each
horso, which is the annual interest of
rather more than three hundred and
fifteen dollars. Yet not one in a hundred
of us ever think of saving it! Few
southern and western men who are 41cell
off? (as the saying is,) keep Ies9 than three
or four horses that do no farm work, and
this the> do at an additional yearly expense,
when oats and unchopped fodder
ore their food, of fifty.seven dollars for
three, and seventy-five dollars for four
horses, rather than be at the small trouble
of having their fodder chopped, and their
ears of corn ground into cob-hominy.
Ten or twelve poor children might be annually
schooled for that sum. For horses
that are often hard ridden and rapidly
travelled, oat? are generally deemed better
than corn, as less heating; but a greater
quantity of them must be given, in the
proportion of about one and a half gallons
of oats to one of corn at each feed. Under
such usage, green food should never
be given if avoidable. But when the horse
can rest for a few days some may be allowed
him, in small quantities, by way of medicine.
Any kind of grass that a horse will cat, may
answer th- ? purpose, but lucerne and clover
of the firs', cutt'in? are deemed best?the
second always sahvatcs?an effect, by the
way, for which no cause. I believe, has yet
been discovered. Presupposing that a horse
has a plenty of wholesome food and proper
grooming, if you would give him a finer coat
than thes^; alone can produce, let half a pint
of sound wheat or a small handful of brown
sugar be mixed with his food, about once in
every six or eight days, for a few weeks, and
the object will be attained far better than by
blanketing, which always makes him more
liable to take cold, when exposed to bad weather,
as he sometimes must necessarily be.
On long journeys in hot weather give your
horses a double /eed at night; in the morning
travel sixteen or twenty miles before you feed
him again, then do it lightly and after he is
perfectly cool. Give a few quarts of soft wa.
ter both before and after his food, then resume
journey and go fifteen or twenty miles farther.
This will eiubleyuu to stop early every evening,
without any night-riding, and will give
both yourself and your horses a long rest to i
recruit your strength. If your horse be
sound, you may thus travel him hundreds of
miles without danger of his failing.
Farm horses may bo kept in good order at
much less expense; for they may be fed, when
unemployed, upon any of the roots which it is
customary to give them in England. In addition
to these, we have the pumpkin and its
varieties, all of which are good food for horses,
but the seed should be taken out, as they are
powerfully diuretic. If such food be at first
rejected, horses may soon be taught to eat it,
by mixing a little salt with it, vand offering
them nothing else for a few days. To this
should b? added, as soon .as they will eat
such a mixture, from thirty to forty pounds of
chopped provender, for twenty-four hours,
and this may be made either of well cured
corn tops, blades, hay, wheat, oats, or rye
straw, or chart. Lorn shucks, ^wiucn is ine
southern name for the covering of the ears,)
answer well to mix when chopped up, with
the roots or pumpkins; if they are salted as
they are put up and kept dry. Another very
good long forage peculiar to our country, consists
of the various kinds of Indian peaviues.
These make excellent food for farm horses, if
exposed to the sun until they are somewhat
wilted, then stacked in alternate layers with
the straw of either wheat, rye or oats, and
each layer sprinkled with salt, as they are
stacked. Thus fed and protected from bad
weather by warm shelters open only to the
south, and well covered with any kind of
thatch, or corn tops or loose straw, farm horses
may be kept healthy and in good order throughout
the southern Slates, without their owners
incurring the expense of wooden or brick stables
for them. Stalls however, should be
made for then) under the shelters, with divia~
ions, high and close enough to prevent their
fighting, and in those they should be tied while
eating. Their managers or troughs should
be wider and deeper, than when racks also
are used, although lhey never should be, or
lazv| hostlers will be sure to avail themselves
of them, if not closely watched. When put
to constant farm work, horses should have
only dry food, three t:mes a day. It may
consist either of bran, shorts, cob'hominy,
ground rye, oats, broom corn, or oats mixed
with chopped stuff* in the proportions already
mentioned?that is, about thirty five pounds
for horses of common size, and forty pounds
for the largest. But after the grass is in
plenty, and as long as it lasts, (if it does not
salivate) they may be turned out of nights
and rest-days, although if your pastures are
large, more tune is lost every morning in
catching them and getting ready for work,
than would amply compensate, if spent in farm
labor, for the expenses of keeping them up,
especially should have any grass to give them

their dry food. To fatten a horse rapidly,
his fodder or hay should always be chopped
and steamed, before it is mixed with the
moal of either corn, oats, or rye, and as much
should be given him, three times a day, as he
will eat without leaving any. Give him also
salt alone as often as he will eat it, and soft
water at least thrice a day, but always with
some meal of either of the above mentioned
grains stirred up with it. A small quantity of
ground Indian peas will add much to the nil.
Iritive properties of his food; and thus treated,
with moderate daily exercise, in good weather,
I the processor fattening will soon be complex

' PREVENTING WEEDS IN ASPARAGUS BEDS,
j Horticulturists say that the best way
; to kill weeds on asparagus beds, is to
water them liberally with beef or pork
brino, or any salt brine. The salt kills
the weed while it nourishes the aspara<
gus, which \s a maritime plant, and grow;

[We have no doubt of the efficacy of:

DEATH FROM CARLESSNESS.

discovered at its bottom, without motion.

often most people he told, that the presence
of foul air may be accurately tested
by simply letting down into a Well a
lighted candle, and that no one should
, dare to go into one, without such experi,

At the instance of some of the neighbors,

DIVORCES.
It is a singular fact, that there are, per>
haps more applications for Divorces* in

i ground that tlrl facility of obtaining a
divorce, encourages gross violation of the
Marriage vow, as the readiest means of
securing the desired result. The number
at the present Session is very large,
though the Committee on that subject
state; that the applicants ore fewer than
usual. One of the successful applies,

TIIK BACIIKLOR.
Wo find in the North American of
Tuesday in the subjoined touching sketch
of the characteristic peculiarities of the
bachelor, and we feel satisfied that no
single man can read it without having
his amiable optics suffused with delightful
tears at discovering that there is no one at
least among the many writers of the day,
who understands the merits and fully appreciates
the praiseworthy fruits which
combine to form the " bachelor." Tney
are a wronged fraternity these persecuted
bachelors?they are the largest target for
I traditional jokes, and must endure the accumulated
quips and cranks of successive
ages. Every occasional black sheep who
has appeared through passing centuries
in the flock of their snowy whiteness,
has contributed the amount ofhisunpopu*
larity to the weight of odium now rising
against the class, and thus it is, that while
i i r?,?i ?k?
eacn hucwi ^utic ^viiicsocu me kiuuiuuui
virtues of the bachelors which belong to
it, these cases ore regarded merely as ex*
ceptions, and the general denunciation
still rolls on. But there is comfort for
tham yet. The North American takes
the field in full panoply, and pleads the
cause with a zeal and earnestness which
must largely contribute to revolutionize
public sentiment and to reverse the harsh
decree of mistaken generations. " I nev.
er knew before how shamefully I had been
wronged," sobbed a plaintiff when he
heard a glib tongued lawyer paint the
case in glowing colors to the listening
jury and thus the bachelor will discover
; from the article now quoted, that he is a
| much "cleverer fellow" than he ever suspected
himself to be.?Pennsylcanian.
Thk Bachelor.?The Inquirer, after
I cruelly reproaching the editor of the Pennsylvanian
and ourself, for no other reason
than that we are bachelors, denounces
the whole tribe as a set of "selfish spirits."
Never was the charge of selfishness
less merited by any class of beings.
The life of a bachelor is as full of benevolence
as the sun is of light ; wherever
! he goes he is regarded as common property,
or rather a common blessing, and all
: avail themselves of his kindness, indulgence,
and simplicity as freely as they
| breathe the atmosphere. There is not a
' mother who does not look upon hirn as
more youthful expectations shall be disappointed
elsewhere. He is considered
a resource against all contingencies of
this kind,and then the widows, too. they
regard him as one providentially left in
this stato to meet their condition; besides
i this, the little children of the whole neigh!
bourhood look to him as a sort of common
uncle; they run to meet him as he walks;
gather around his chair as he sits; climb
his knees, finger his locks, pick out his
breastpin, and get his watch out of his
pocket to their ear, and then they want
to know when he is going to take another
ride in his carryall, when he is going
again to Mrs. Busllos fancy shop, or Mrs.
Filbert's confectionary. He with the
benevolence that melts like dew on the
i tender plants, instead of feeling himself
annoyed, has a smile, a kiss, and a promise
j for all. And he will keep that promise
i too. he is the only being in the world
who keeps his promises to children.
But he is not only this kind and benevolent
being, when those around him
are in health but more especially so, when
sickness has overtaken nny of thein. He
| will hunt all day to find a bird that may
! suit the weak, or fastidious stomach of
| the patient; and though after all his pains
, taking, not a boAe of it may bo picked,
i y?rt he is just as ready to start the neit
rbry and look up another, and all thn? is
duos for wife, widow, or child alike. If
death renders vain these kind attention*,
his benevolence flows off in another
channel. Those mourning dresses,
which were beyond the meets of th*
mourner, but not beyond her grief, h?*e
been, unbeknown to others, mjpplied
him; for he lettetb not hm toft hand
know what his right hand dneth. Oflaa
the simple slab is erected by him. Mid
still oftcner those left in orphanage and
want share the atfection and solitude of
his paternal heart. Were hi* hearth
large enough they would all be groHpHf
about it, a group now more dear to him*
as their other support* and hope* U&v*
been broken.
Such are the feeling* and such the
benevolent habit* of the good old bachelor.
He is a blessing to the community in
which be lives. He n a husband for all
the widows, and all those disappointed
elsewhere; he is the indulgeat uncle of afl
the children; he attendants the arch, bodes,
the dead, and tskra care of the frrfug.
Blessings on him; blessings on hi* occupation;
blessings on bis memory.

of grievances."
If slavery is a grievance, it is a griev.
ance to those States and Territories
where it exists, and it is an abuse of Ian.
guage to say that the incendiaries and
agitators and disunionists in the nun.
slaveholding States, who endeavor in
propagate their disorganizing doctrine*
here, are people who " peaceably aaeem*

argument's sake, that in this I am wrong:
when the people have assembled and pe.
titioned, their constitutional privilege
Upon this subject has been fulfilled,?
When the petitions are presented nero,
our privileges commence, and we have
the right to dispose of them in any nuiu
tier that we may think proper. What
has been more common from the com,
moncement of the Government than to
lav a petition upon the table upon its first
presentation, without allowing it to be dabated,
read, or referred ? There is scarce,
ly a gentleman in this House who has
not voted to dispose of single petitions in
this way ; and, if it is constitutional thus
to dispose of single petitions, why not
dispose of a class of them, all relating to
the same subject, in the same manner?
Where is the substantial difference, in
point of constitutional right, between re.
fusing to receive a petition and refusing
to consider it ? And yet wi?o has ev?T
supposed the Constitution violated when
a petition upon its presentation hat been
laid upon the table, without allowing n
moment's time for explanation ? The
truth is, as was well remarked by the gen.
tleman from Pennsylvania, (Mr. C, J.
Ingersoll,) at the extra session, undue
importance has been attached in Ihtn
country to the right of petition, by ooo*
founding It with the right of petition as U
exists under Governments where the
only political right that the people have is
j the right of petition. Do not gentlemen
I degrade their constituent* when they at*
tach so much importance to a right which
| is more properly the right of a slave than
of n freeman?
There are other grounds upon which
the twenty-first rule must be admitted to
he perfectly constitutional. Few gentlemen
on this floor will contend that
Congress is bound to receive a petition
tho subject matter of which it has no constitutional
right to legislate upon; and
still fewer, I trust, who will contend that
Congress has the right to legislate u|*>n
the subject of abolition. As regards the
States, abolitionist* and all admit that
Congress cannot legislate. As regards
the District of Columbia, all, I presume,
but rabiJ abolitionists, will admit that wo
are bound, both by good faith and constitutional
obligations, not to legislate upon
the subject. As regards Florida, we are
bound not only by the obligations of (in*
Constitution, which will not permit us
any more to destroy or injure the property
of the citizen in his slave than in his horse
or farm, but also by express treaty stipu- '
lation and the obligations of the Missrniri
compromise. 80 far as the twenty-flrst

I will allude to one more ground upon
which this rule is defensible, and which, if
i am not mistaken* 1 have often heard
