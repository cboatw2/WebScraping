some hue apeciuiens of her productions '
in the^rnus homo on this ilior. But still ,
it may hti said that, with all her natural !
advantages, populat on has not advanced
.so rapidly as in the neighboring statu of
Oho. The cause is obvious. Her in-j
habitants have turned their attention ver\
tu'ieh to pasturage. Her wealthy pro. !

floorer nciglrUors; and blooded horses, I

The gentleman from Massachusetts ' <
has said that " Texas was curved with jl
the sin of shivery restored, ' and even he i
was forced to n^'kixmletl^c. -in STlhsfancc t
that tlie South was not so deeply guilty. <
Texas, guilty as the gentleman supposes <
her, has never forged fetters for ttre arms
< f a freeman. The slaves which she j n
loads are hereditary bondmen, taken from I
this country ; ami when she contrasts i
her rapid progress in prosperity with the ; i
inlxrcilc and wretched condition of the : :

Irot likely that, with all (he imprecations ;

Out let us look a* thissukjoct in anoth- :
aspect. The pipducliou* of the slave- {
labor of the South is one of the p-iucipal 1
means |?y which tins nation has ris^n tr?
ii;ts present commercial importance. Alter '
wipplvinjr oitr manufactures with the raw |
material of cotton, and almost the entire !
consumption of the country in rice and ,
tobacco, tlio.se three great staples raised
in a section of the cottnlry containing !
than a third of (he population, con.
di lute more than two thirds of the export? I
?h the domestic produce of the whole i
Union. To say nothing of rice and to- j
K.iccs), the single article of cotton pro- j
diiced at the South, in its cultivation, '
manufacture, and sale, does more to feed
tnc hnngrv, to clothe the naked, and
i.iuiltT-ihnn nrnnnrr men. than IS
produced hy times ttic population in !
h.iv other part of the world. Abstract
this article from commerce, and you
would not only reduce millions to wretche
Iiicss and want who have never seen an i
African slave, hut you would cover the)
earth with barbarism. The possession of;
this ureal key of commerce will do more
Ti J .
to preserve our amicable relations witb
England than would an army of a Iiuii
did! thousand men. or a navy twice a.? J
fitron;; as the one that we have. !
it appeal from this statement that ;
elavryy low weight |iHe pn incubus op i
lhe country, and that our advancement j '
has been retarded bv its existence among ,?
? i
i?s? If gentlemen suppose that cotton ( '
ran he cultivated extensively for export 1
where African slavery does not exist, i j:
n"'d hut refer them to the Republics of i 1
fcoutii Amecica. and to Mexico, where the '
rliaintc and soil arc equally advantageous, i
IVoin no portion of South America, e\- : 1
ccpt Brazil. where this institution is still >
preserved, is cotton a valuable article of I
export. . I may be pointed to liie East '
indies, and referred to the great increase ?
of the imj?ort of cotton from that region | <
into England for the last year or two ? J t
This may be attributed to the combined r
influence of the present condition of; a
tilings in tho East, bv which the cultiva- :i
1i<?u of the poppy has been checked, tlic
< hiiia market closed against India cotton j
r ;d the strong temporary stimulus of i
English abolitionism. I would be p!o:i?ob 1 v
it a enndid nlmlitionist (looking at Mr. ; a

thmjstK of country depend upon Rid, i c
il not from iho British Government, at v

id hy the course winch has been taken,
n this debate by the gentlemen who pre- ,
:cdcd ine, i wi!l, for the purpose of show-;
ng the gross injustice of taunting upon
is upon this subject, enter into a brief (
listoiy of African slavery. The African
iluvu trade, as is known I presume to
^very gentleman of the House, was com-1
mouced by the Portuguese, at that time
an important couimerciai and navigating
people, about the middle of the loth century.
It, however, made hut little pro- j
gross until early in the 16th century, i
when tho Emperor Charles the 5th, from j
motives of humanity, and to prevent the j
destruction of the Indians engaged to ;
working the mines in the Spanish West j
India islands, authorized (lie importation (
nf Africans. From that time it rapidly j
spread throughout all the Southern Euro
on this licnisolitiie; and it ?
|?'/U II -- p ?T
mav by truly -- uitl thai the South has never j
what had the question presented to her under
circumstances thai she couid exercise
thcchoico whether she would or would not |
allow tliis institution to exist upon her soil/
I have seen it historically stated that, j
as oarlv "as tOOd," the very year that :
the gentleman's ancestors landed at Ply- |
mouth, in Massachusetts." aud only a- i
bout thirteen years after the sentiment at |
Jamestown, in \ irgin.n, a Datcli vessel:
from the coast of Cioua Railed uj> the i
James rivCr aud lauded the tirst African ,
slave that was ever brought to I>:il s i
\meriea." Aliican slavery then, is coeval !
in this country with its settlement by a ,
civilized and C'hiistian race of men. Not i
only African slavery, hut the African '
slave trade, existed through the entire i
period of our colonial dependence on the i
mother country; through the war of the j
Revolution ; during the period that we |
were united under the articles of Con fed- j
oration; and under the Constitution by i
virtue of which we are now assembled, j
down to the year The Constitution j
expressly declares? |
The migration or importation of such i
persons as any of the States now existing j
>h ili think proper to admit, shall not he j
prohibited by Congress prior to the year
one thousand eight hundred and eight; j
but a tax or duty may he imposed on j
such importation not exceeding ton dollars
for ea'-h p r?on."
Thus we see that not only African j
slavery is, hilt ihe African slave trade i
f>vnr*-?lv recognised by the Consli- i
...... - -, . - - tulion
under which wo are assembled ; a
trade which, permit me to say, was con- i
detuned at the South he Co re it was at the ,
North?-a trade which is now condemned '
at the South n# nv.cii as it is at the North; 1
and a trade eH'eotiially to suppress which j
I am willing and prepared to go ?.< Car as J
lio wiU pro farthest; hut, under the I
pretext of suppressing whteh, | hiu not |
willing th?t the ling of titv country should j
he wantonly insulted l?v tho cruisers o?a '
foreign Power. The gentleman, in his !
remarks on yesterday, spoke- of it as a re- j
mark-able tin ig that, wtiiie a member ot
Mr. Monroe's Cabinet. he should have reusted
liieelainiofthe British (Government
to search our vessels for the alleged oh- j
ject of suppressing this trade, while |
Southern slaveholders, members of the i
same Cabinet, were in favor of it. I do |
not tinnk that it is at ail remarkable; for
f Chore wore any portion of this country
mgaged in the Vfrican slave trade, thev I
CO 7
were not the people of the South; and if
he people of rinv section of this country
ire inorcNnlcresleii lliuii all the rest in j
oppressing it. thev are the 'people of the
South. In addition to rhe motives which

iveol Hi lt'-mterext to suppress this trade;
'or, as must he evident to all, the introluetion
of every additional slave info nnv
if toe West India islands or on ativ part
?f tl.e continent, increases the competi-j
ion of sieve labor, and reduces the value |
n't hose already here. This, therefore, I
I
is the gentlemen seems to suppose, is not '
i Southern question ; and, although we I
ue not willing thai England should he j
icrmittcd to prescribe to us a new rule j
ipoo the subject of search, neither are we j
filling that our flag should protect nspirite.
I acknowledge the difficulty of t* 111 -
ricnt action on tile part ol the cruisers of J
:?thi?r nation in suppressing this trade !
vithout a mutual right of visitation, at. j
ended by sufficient examination to as- j
.ertain the nationality <>f a suspicious ves. j
iel over whose deck the flag ol' cither is;
iiifurled. If it where will you place thoi
i:nit between examination and search; or,
f y on permit the one, how can we insure !
o our vessels engaged in lawful com- j
ncrce protection against the abjsos iucilen'
to the other?
We have hv our legislation inflicted no
vrnngs upuii AI'ricH, certainly none since !

England, and perhaps her zeal imv bo 1
ncreased from a desire to make some re- :

surd and delusive principles as the slave ; "

which it proceeded was, that five years!'
were suffi ient to clothe the slave with :
the habits and desires of a freeman, and .
render the transition, from servitude to j ,
liberty safe and salutary; it may safely i <
be affirmed that fire hundred years would '
have hcon little enough for the inomen- J
tous change. How long did it take to | 1

deiitly because it is a necessary step in
the progress of civilization; because without
it savage man never has worked, an f j
never will work; because without its con- j
corn the human race would bo chained i
forever to the hunter or shepherd state;
because, hut for the slavery of our Saxon .
nrocrtmiiors, we would now have been
l I '
wandering in the woods; because, what- j
ever evils may be attendant on servitude, j,
and they arc many and grievous, they |
arc trivial in comparison of the universal ?
and widespread penury, the total stoppage 1
of the advance and prospects of the hu |
man race, which instantly follows the
cursing of uncivilized man with the nnini.

nal blessings, hut the real destitution, of j
freedom. * * * * Does the cessa j '
linn of the slave trade over the globe, i
the evident amelioration of the African j
race, and the stoppage of the uuutto *
horrors of the middle passage, console j
the fri .mds of humanity of all their liopo# ,
and blasting of their enpectations on the j
other side of the Atlantic? Alas! here ,
tiie prospect is even more gloomy than j
on the sunny slopes of Jamaica, now j
choked with weeds, or the rich marshes
of Guiana, fast r lapsing into jungle.
The slavo trade .been doubled in extent
and quadrupled in horrors throughout the
globe by the monstrous act; and the.
sufferings of the African race, under European
cupidiy, are now incomparable greater than
when the philanthropy of WiTberforLC and !
Clarksori first intcrferred for their relief. The
rapid decline in the agricultural produce of;
tb? firitish Wesr. Zndia is ands ha* giveu i
impulse to the foreign slave colonies which is
almost incredible, and augmented to an ex* j
tent which it is piteous to think of both the !

But to return from this digression. I
cannot believe that there can he h war,
or even a serious difficulty between
two nations having so many motives to
preserve their amicable relations, upon a
point like this. Politicians, like other |
individuals, may effect sentiment, and j
use set phrases about the interests of hu- j
rnanitv; but the age is too utilitarian to j
sacrifice real advantages upon a question j
of not more importance than is involved ;
in the controversy of whether the cruisers i
of either, engaged in (ho suppression of
the African slave trade, shall he allowed
by visitation, and, if necessary, by examination,
to ascertain Che nationality of a
suspicious vessel hearing the Hag of the
other. Both nations are, I believe, equally
sincere in their endeavors to suppress
this trade: hut I would make no concession
upon the subject, andjif lvigland nt.
lempts the exercise of a rigut to which i
she is not entitled by the law of nations,
she should he held responsible for the
consequences. We know that her disposition
is to encroach on the maritime
rights of ail nations; and if the permit he i
in inch, there is danger she will claim an <
ill.
I rejoice that there is no evidence of
ihe African slave trade to this country, |
iven to the minutest extent. I live in
the centre of the slavcholding States, and
represent one of the wealthiest agricuUurll
districts in the Union, bordering for
nany miles in the ocean, where slaves !
mve always been in active demand; hut J
[never have, to the best of my know!- |
?dgc, seen or even or heard of an I
Vfricau imported, since the la w of Coii-j
;ross prohibiting the African slave trade j
irat went info effect.
But, previous to the year 1803, who1

party are to he found on the other
side. I flatter myself that since the vote
on the reception of the petitions from
abolitionists to dissolve the Union, we
shall have many more of the first named
party voting with us on this question ; for
surely they cannot, in the fare of their
recorded votes upon the reception of those
petitions, any longer say that it is a mutter
of conscience with them to receive anil

however, continue divided, as they havr
hitherto been on this subject, the South
will not long doubt with which it it is hei
true interest to unite. The friends ol
the Union every where will not long
doubt in the triumph of which there wil
be the greatest security for its preservation.
There are one or (wo gentlemen or

under no obligation to receive or conxidci
abolition petitions, do nevertheless votf

think these g ntlcmen are wron_r. Thr

Yesterday morning at an early hour, a
large concourse of people assembled at
the Place d'arrnes, under a high state ol
excitement produced by the sudden depreciation
of Municipality Notes. In
consequence of the suddenness of resump.
tion. the Municipalities had no opportuni

Place (VAmies crowded to the Mayor'.oflice,

some excitement when tlicy were refused

o'clock, whilst looking over the mail, not^
in the least expecting an outbreak, our
attention was arrested by n clamor in the
streets, which proved to have been made
by the incensed mob, on their way to
J the Second Municipality to break up the
i Brokers. We could form no accurate ea?
I timate of the number of persons engaged
in the riot, as a large portion of the crowd
was attracted bv curiosity. The mob
proceeded across Canal-street, and before
there could he formed any organixed re?
Hisfance went into several oT the limners
ofTirp.s at and near ihe corner of Canal
and Curnp.streets, which were completely
rifled. J'he citizens, however, soon ascertained
the object of the mob, and with
commendable promptness put an end to
, their depredations. It is imposa'ble to
? conceive how quickly the infuriated roa^s
was put down. A few of our more rem(
Into citizens were near the corner of
Camp and Canal streets at the commencement
of the outbreak, and without hesitalion
went into the crowd and arrested *ev.

Some six or eight persons were arrested
and taken to the .Municipal jail. Several

We remarked, amongst some of the
ord- r'y citizens, persons who expressed
great sympathy fur the rioters; but these

disgust at the roguish nee* of such of

After the mob was suppressed, the city
was filled with all sorts of rumors ?
