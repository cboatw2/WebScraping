liiui our thanks for his good feeling and kind
offices. His ground of complaint is just, qi.
.. which we have long been aware. But, in the
cirumstances^it could not be avoided.' We
have arrangements in view, or' rather in progress,
which we expect to carry into operation
m the course ot* tlie fall, and which will efleet
a change that we hope will prove satisfactory.
As.to the vocation which our subseiibcr supposes
to be 44 more lucrative," the balance is
on the wrong side of the-Leger. But there
are other considerations apai;t from that of
, . mere profit .and loss, which, in some positions'"
should influence every member of society.
We refer merchants of the interior to the
"rates of freight- between Georgetown and
Cheraw," and to the advertisement stating
that efforts are making to reduce the freights
from New York to Georgetown. We ask. up
country merchants to make their dalciilutians
whether it is not their interest to choose this
line of transportation for their goods. The
Steamboat OSEOLA has abundantly proved
lierself to be well adapted to the river, and

it is always navigable when the other rivers
of this State and Xortk Carolina are so.*

[ in the afternoon train to Portsmouth but-such j N
} was the distress and consternation ' prevailing ;
i at the moment, that they could ascertain but* v
j few particulars,- previous to their leaving tlie c
; fatal spot. 11 appears that the cars when they j
i went up in the morning were unusually full of j 'i
I passengers, male, and female, the greater por- ! j;
! lion of whom composed a party of pleasure, j v
j from the counties of Southampton, Ilse of; t

' road makes a curve. But before we proceed c
! ?vo should state, that there was a lumber train u
, employed on the road in bringing down staves, > a
' which was expected with a heavy load of' c
