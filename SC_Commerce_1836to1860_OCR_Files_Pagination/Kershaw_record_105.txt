Postponement of the drawing of the
Splendid Scheme of the ALEXANDRIA
LOTTERY, Class E, (Highest Capital $75,000)
from the 27th of May to the 23d of September
next.
From the general embarrassment ol the times ;
the deranged slate of the domestic exchanges, and
the difficulties attending the disposal of Bank Bills
out ot their immediate circles of issue, we have
been solicited by fegents and Venders to postpone
the drawing of the above scheme, for a short time, |
unm me present crisis in me anairs ot tlie conn- '
try shall have passed a ay.,
We have therefore yielded to therte solicitations,
and postpone the drawing ol the Alexandria Lotte1
ry, ci.ass E, from the 27th of May, to the 23d day
of September next, when the drawing will positively
take place.
Adventurers having purchased tickets in said
class, and who d<? not wish to hold them until the
drawing, can have their money returned by the
agent 01 broker from whom they purchased?or can
exchange them for tickets in classes to be drawn
at an earlier day, as it may suit their pleasure.
The Managers have consented to tnis postpone
ment with extreme reluctance, as it has always
been their policy to draw every scheme at the time
announced. The unparalleled state of the country,
is the only cause of this one departure from
the usual custom
All the other schemes noiv before the public,'will
be punctually drawn on the days nnnounced.

PATENT COTTON GIN.
ra^HIS Gin can be made double..or single. If
I made double, they reduce labor, and gin just
double, the quantity of cotton over the single cylinder
Gin, no other knd having been in use prevous
to this patent; and whether single or double, they
.ire found to improve the quality of the cotton, by
more perfectly cleaning it. They can be made to
contain from 20 to 100saws in a stand, und whether
unall or large, one hand will be sufficient to attend
tliein. The Gins Irave mechanical feeders and
hoppers altaehed to thein, which free the cotton
troin leaves, trash, dirt, &,c. before it can teach the
saws, and by the thorough hackling operation it
receives from the feeders, which make two revolutions
to one of the saws, it is almost in a half
gincd state, before it descends to the saw By a
very simple arrangement of a screw to each set of
gaatcs, on which the hoppers rest, a>>d through
which the teeth of the feeders pass, they can be
made to feed slow dr fast to suit the condition of
the cotton at the time. When made double, the
saws are placed on two sets of cylinders and turn
upon each other in opposite directions, and are
cleansed by two sets of brushes that have four revolutions
to one of twe saw. The two cylinders can
be detached so as to enable the planter to run one
or both at pleasure, although embraced with feeders.
&c. in one stand. The whole is put in operation
with a drum and band, as in the ordinary Gin, and
may be pTopelled by horse, steam, or water power.
It inny also be propelled by iron running gear.
The lorce required to work it, is about the snme as i
Lhat necessary to movean equal number of saws in I,
Ihe common Gin. This Gin has been put in
operation in New Orleans lor two or three weeks,
ind its success tested in the presence of a large
aumber of planters, merchants and others, and 1
eceived their general approbation.
Several gentlemen have been so kind as to give :
he Patentee their written opinion respecting the 1
merits of the Gin. A number of others could be
ldded, but the following are deemed sufficient: '
from his Excellency Gov. White of Louisiana. 1
New Orleans, Feb. Ml, 1H37. I
Dr. A. Jones?Sir, In reply to your enquiry, 1
vhat I think of your improved Cotton Gin, I linve
o say, that 1 saw it work on Saturday the 25th inst. '
ind was verv much nleased with iln nprl<inimni>o 1
rhe more fact of its self-feeding, seems to ine to
>e a very valuable improvement; and besides, the
]u?tlily of the cotton, as it comes out of the pro:pb8,
appeared to me to be better and cleaner thnn
rom the common Gins in use, and that it saves
sonsiderably in labor. Respectfully, &c.
E. D. WHITE.
From Mr J. Compton, a wealthy planter, resident
in the Parish of Rnpide, Louisiana.
Dr. Jones?Dear Sir, I have examined your Paent
Cotton Gin, with feeders, &c. And have
?een it in operation, and npprove of it so highly,
hat I have taken the liberty of ordering one for

From Mr. G. Senior, a Machinist of New Orleans.
Dr. A. Jones?Dear Sir, in answer tc your inquiry
of my opinion of your Patent Cotton Gin, I
beg leave to slate, thai 1 was fifteen years engafred
in the cotton factories of Manchester, Eng.
and, and during four years of that time, 1 was
foreman in the house of Messrs. Lewis, Williams
& Co., and near five years spinner in the house of
Messrs. Sandford & Gnenr. 1 have 6een your
Cotton Gin in operation, and hove'examined the
cotton ginned by it, and pronounce it better cleansed,
and the staple less injured, than any cotton
that ever came under my observation. It is completely
rea?:y for the breaker without the aid of the
blower, and would, therefore, save the first process
in manufacturing the article. I consider cotton
cleansed by your Gin, would command from one
to two cents on the pound more than the average
crops brought into the Manchester market, and
cleansed by common Gins Yours, very resp'ly.

desire saws of larger diameter than others. The
most common siie is 0 or It) inches ; but some wish
Ihem JSi inches. Some wish f> or (> rows of brushes
on an axle, while others do not want more than 4
it most. Some wish saws with 8 or 0 teeth to the

discrepancy, we prefer they should, at the time of

shall make thfm on the most modern and approved
