but he also signed the Harbor bill of 1839, con- 1
taining appropriations for the improvement of
navigation, for in the interior of the country.
In 1819, Gen. Harrison voted for a resolution
in the Ohio legislature, which contained a re- 1
commendation, that the surplus in (he treasury
should be employed in the internal Improvement
of the country, by roads and r.anah^ and
in the support and encouragement of Domestic
^Manufactures." in a letter to Sherod Williams
in 1836, he says, that no money should be
taken from the Treasury of the U. S. to he expended
on Internal) inprovements but for those
that are strictly national." His limitation of
the expenditures of the public money to such
objects as are national, evidently proceeds not
from constitutional objections, but upon grounds
of expediency. In the same letter, he speaks
of the jealousies which have been followed by
expenditures for such objects, and alludes to
thcin as an additional reason for distributing
the surplus revenue among the States, so that
w each State may have the means of accomplishing
its own 6che.no of Internal Improvements."

For Internal Improvements by the States.

for a resolution recommending its appropriation
to the Internal Improvement of the country by
mads and canals and for the encouragement
of Domestic Manufactures.
1 have given you, geut.cman, somewhat in
detail, an o Aline of the most important facts
and circumstances in my possession, to form
an opinion of the views of the Presidential candidates
upon questions of general politics of
most importance to our inrerests, and to form
a conclusion from the measures which they
have advocated, I have no hesitation in say-'
ing, that they both entertain opinions which I
tlkinlr o ro ktrrliln aki?t/ih/inftklA o rwl Ia 1
fiiniv\ aig ii'ginjr uuj^i iii'iiai/irt anu w? w mvii i
presume that you will not subscribe. But
South-Carolina will not as in the two last presidential
elections stock her arms upon neutral
ground, and it is necessary for us to decide
which we prefer J It is a grave and important
question, and let us turn in any direction, we
meet difficulties. On one hand is the sub-treasury
with the specie clause?a measure that i
forms the principal ground both of Mr. Van
Bureu'8 popularity, and unpopularity in this
State, and to whJch you know that I am opposed.
Why then it may be asked, do I not at
once decide against Mr. Van Buren ? If this
was tiie only question involved I would do
so. But if General Herrison is elected, and
the Whigs get into power, there is danger of
a National Bank, and between it and the sub
treasury, there is at least this difference. If
found to operate prejudicially to the great in
terra or trie country, uie suu treasury may at \
any dine be repealed. A National Bank must not i
only continue for tlie term of its charter, but ;
with great resources at command, would not .
improbably become so indtntified with the j
commerce of the country, as to render it ex- (
cerdingly difficult to refuse to its rechartcr.? t
Do you not all recollect the convulsions which i
preceeded the expiring agonies of the late c
u monster," when by a rapid curtailment of its r
circulation, it endeavoured for a time to pro-* I
duce such an effect upon the public mind, as i
would not only compel a restoration of the pub- (
lie depositee, which it assumed to claim as <
a right, but a renewal of its charter ? It is a *
high eulogy on the virtue .and intelligence of 1
the people, that in the alarm that was indus- 1
triously raised of an impending commercial 1
and political crisis, they remained true to the
constitution and to the country. Sliould
the party by which General Harrison ^
is supported, get into power, there is also dan- c
ger of the introduction of latitudinarian doc- t
trinrs, which the South, destined as she is to a c
permanent minority, should sedulously guard a
against, * liich would in a great measure sub- r
stilute the discretion of Congress, for our glor- c
ious constitution, and might produce a general c
revival of tliuse obnoxious measures, which but *
lately not only produced the most bitter sec- }
tic nal animosities, but even endangered the !
existence of tlie union. To General Harrison 1
individually, I do not know that the objections '
are very prominent when compared with Mr.
VanBuren. Indeed if we take into review r
their whole political lives, there are reasons $
why a southern inan should prefer him. But, a
notwithstanding the pure political orthodoxy t
of mc?t of his southern, and of some of his w< ?" a
tern friends, I am as I have before intimated,
afraid of the high toned federalism of the great 1
mass of the party by which he is supported. fl
Some however, even of his northern friends, 1
say that so far as the tariff is concerned, they J!
will adhere to the compromise which the South
ha? sanctioned, that there will be no National ^
Bank, till the South demands it?and that they r
wish to see political abolitionism buried in a t
grave from which there shall be no resursec- c
tion. uut aomn mat tney are sincere, can
thev, when the barriers of the constitution,
which are only to be preserved by a strict constrict
ion of the powers of the government, are
broken down, resist the clamorous importunities
of their constituents to vwte for measures
which they beli* ve to be for their best inter*
ests. Or is it wise in us, under such circum6i
ances. to unite with a party for whom we can
entertain but little sympathy, in breaking down
the Democratic party of the non.slave holding
States. A party whose more limited views in
relation to the powers of Congress, make them
the natural allies of the South. Many of
whom are opposed to a Tariff* for protection,
\m Internal Improvement by the General
Government, for objects not strict'y
nations', and to a National Bank upon consti.
tutional grounds. A large majority of the
members of which, have, to a much greater extent
than their opponents, vindicated the rights
uf the South, by an open and manly opposition
to political Abolitionism, and by whose assistance
we have mainly been enabled, in defiance
of hypocritical lamentations for the pretended
violated rights of petition to exclude
that dangerous subject from the halls of the
National Legislature. Petitions to do what?
Virtually to violate the Constitntinn_tn inter.
fere with our domestic institutions, to plunder g
us of our property?to excite our slaves to v
insurrection?to convert the South into a wil- }
dcrness. and to dissolve the Union. t
The circumstance that every member of, or 1
known advocate of the Aboltion Societies of '
the non slave holding States, in Congress, not 1
only is opposed to Mr. Van Buren's, re-elect. 1
ion, but is a zea'pus advocate of Gen. liarri. \
son's election to the Presidency, ought not of J
itself perhaps, to have an influence in determining
our choice in as much as those mem. j
bers may be opposed to Mr. Van Buren and <
may advocate Gen. Harrison upon grounds not i
at all the connected with abolition. But what (
would you say, gentlemen, if I were to tell i
you that at least three of the eight members 1
III.
that c? mposc tl?e Whig Executive Committee, ?
regularly appointed by the opposition members <
rif Congress, and Whose daily occupation it has
been for months past to flood the countijr
with documents, advocating the election of
Gen. Harrison, and who exercise the powcf
of appointing corresponding cormrtUtees in va- (
rious parts of the Dnion, are not only advocates ,
for the consideration of abolition petitions in
Congress, Imt are themselves pledged abolition,
isls and were so long before tkeir appointment.
The Coin nittec of which I speak is composed
nf I?!in Roil Tmin. R. Garland, of La.,
John M, Bolts, of Va., Thos. Corwin of Ohio,
M, H. Grinnell, ofN; Y. Iicverctt SoltonstaU,
of Mass., Trucman Smith, of Conn., Chas.
Naylor, of Penn., an<l John Clark, of N. Y. <
Of these, three at least, are pledged abolition"
ists, to wit, Trucinan Smith, of Connecticut, >
Leverett Sontoostall, of Mass., and John C.
Clark, ol N. Y., and of this the most ample and
conclusive proof is to be found in their own
letters, addressed to Anti-Slavery Societies, or
t? persons friendly to abolition in their respective
States, when thnv wore candidates for the
seats which thpy now hold in Congress. For
extracts embodying the substance of these
'ettcrs, which you will find of the most start
tling character, particularly when you take
into consideration the opportunities which their
writers have of communicating the mora! poison
with which they are infected to others, I
refer you to the Extra Globe of July 1st. In
addition to his being a pleged abolitionist, Leverett
Soltonstsll one of the persons t have
named, was also a member of the Committee
of the Massachusetts legislature, which during
the last war while every patriot disregarding,
supposed local grievances should have been
united in bringing it to a successful termination,
recommended the Hartford Convention.
With this he was charged during the late session
of Congress, by one of his democratic colleagues,
and attempted to excuse himself if not
defend the objects of that Convention.
I bring no charge against tire opposition
members of Congross for having appointed
these three worthies on their most important
Committee, because their dangerous sentiments.
although long and onenly avowed may,
by possibility, have escaped their observatidn.
But I do charge that party, or at least the anti-abolition
part of it, and those who profess
doctrines of strict construction, with gross di
reliction for allowing pledged abolitionist* and
Hartford Convention, federalists to remain on
a Committee which was their selected organ
of communication with the people of this coun.
try, after their sentiments were made knowu 1
through the Columns of the public press in 1
Washington at least twenty days before the
adjournment ofCongrrs*. a id could not by J
feasibility have escaped their observation.
Suppose it should be said that no documents J
ire circulated as proceeding from the Com- ,
uittee, that are not by a majority of all* its j
member*, (I know not whether it is so or not) <
it is no excuse for retaining on it pledged ah- <
Mitionists, known to be so. F??r f lie moral i
;ffect, if for no other, they should have been i
expelled from the Committee, and their degra. i
jati<>n, should have been publicly made known. 1
There are members of that party who are ;
truly patriotic, who drank deeply at the foun- ]
tains of political wisdom, and who are honest '
ind pure in the opinions which they advocate |

ed in many of the non slavuholding Statos that I
he election of President with the patronage ne- *

>f the office would give the majority to either. A '
eference to the journals of Congress, to tho pro. *

States, will shew that of the two great parties (
vhich devide the country, the Democratic is less *
ndoctriuatod than their opponents with lalitud. \
narian docttines, and consequently its ascend. '
mcy is less dangerous to the South. A faithful <
idherenco to the Constitution, and limiting the 1
general government within its legitimate bounds, 1
low is, and ever will be, the best bulwark of the !
South against the encroachments of an irrcspon
lible majority, and is the ouly safe guarantee for 1
he continuance ofthe Union wi'h its blessings 1

In suying this, however, I enter my protest
igainst all arguments by which the specie clause

:ratic party to the support of the manufacturers,
ending to show that in proportion as it operated
0 reduce the nominal prices of labor, and to

heir interests. 1 here arguments, although perlaps
incidentally used, make a direct appeal to
ivaricisus f .clings, and have a very broad squining
towards interference with the domestic inlustry
of the country, to the prejudice of the incrests
of the planting Slates.
Except whrn there may be a departure fVptn

character, particularly with the first,
[lis enemies will not deny that they have been
sonducled with prudence, with firmness, and with

mtcrtained by Congress in Mr. Van Buren's pa.Holism
and discretion I need only state that'

Having alroadv extended this very imierfc<
t hitter to an inconvenient length* I
will, after answering distinctly the questions
which, in carrying the resolutions of the Democratic
party of Marion into effect, you hare
propounded to me,lo-wit.
1st. u Are you in favor of the re-electron of
Mr. Van Buren as President of the United
States ?
"2d. In esse the election for President
should come into the House of Representatives,
which of the two candidates would you vote
for?"
To the first of these questions, I answer,
that however much I may object to certain incidents
in Mr. Van Buren's political life, or
dissent from particular measures of his Administration
I am, under existing circumstances,
in favor of his re-election; because his course
upon the whole, since he has been President
of the United States, has been sucli, in my estimation,
as to entitle him to the confidence of
the South; and because I prefer the principles
of the party in the non-slave-holding states by
wnich he is supported, and whose ascendency
I believe to be in a great measure identified
with his re-election, to those of the party in
the same states by which he it opposed.
To your seconu interrogatory, the answer
is already made, so far as my personal preferences
are concerned, but should the contingency
happen, which your question contemplates
I will endeavor to carry out the choice of the
state as it may be expressed by her electoral
vote.
I am, gentlemen, very respectfully,
Your obedient servant,

FALSE ATTITUDES OF CHILDREN.
The false postures and attitudes taken by
young persons at school, or when engaged
in some particular trade or labor, often b<;come
a cause of distorted sp!ne and other
deformities?a state to be deplored in all,
but more especially pitiable in the female
sex. fri the remarks which we propose
making on the causes, prevention, and hygienic
treatment of these deformities, we
shnll content ourselves with the arguments
and illustrations in the work of Surgeon
Duffin, to which we have already directed
the attentive perusal of all parents, guar,
dians, and instructors, on whose knowledge
of this miuter much will depend, before professional
assistance is invoked.
For the better understanding of the subject
by our readers, we shall premise a few
particulars respecting the structure of the
parts more immediately nlfected in spinal |
distortion. We caunot, of course, be ex.
pected, in that place, to speak with professional
or technical precision; hut while endeavoring
to be plain, we hope to be accurate;
at least enough so for hygienic purposes.
The back bone is a pillur built of twenty-four
short cylindrical bones, called vertebrae,
piled one upon another, and extended
from the large solid bones that support
the body, when sitting erect, to the lowest
part of the head. We say nothing for the
present of the projections from the vertebrae,
but proceed to * remark that the body, as
the centre-part is called, does not directly
fouch the one above, or the oqe Delow itthere
intervea a strong elastic substance of
of considerable thickness, which is girt
round by a powerful ligamentous band.?
.This substance, culled technically rntcrvcr
tebral, retains the two vertebrae to which it
belongs, continually together; and though,
strictly speaking, it prevents ull immediate
motion of one bone of the spine upon an.
other, permits of the most extensive motion
of the whole column of bones taken
conjointly, by means of the great elastic
power of which it is possessed. To which
ever side the body inclines, this substance
readily yields and returns in a moment to
its proper position, by a very powerful
spring, when when the weight of the body
and force of the muscular contraction cease
to operate. As this substance is continually
yielding underpressure during the day
a person of ordinary stature, will often be
found considerably toller in the morning,
than at night. In old age, the body is shor.
ter than in youth, from the greater condensation
of this substance; and its inclination
forwards, in persons advanced in years deponds
upon the yielding of this compressi. <
hie substance to the weight of the superincumbent
structure. Hence any undue
inclination to either side, during life, if frequent,
constant or protracted, will cause a
certain diminution in the thickness of this
substance on the side to which the body inclines,
accompanied by a proportionate rising
of the same, on the oppsite side, and
will in the course of time produce permanent
distortion of the whole column of bones.
This effect will be more easily produced
during childhood, when the bones are in a 1
state of growth, the ligaments more yieldjng,
and the intervertebral substance, peculiarly
soft. mA tumor on the head or

makes a child carry the head on one side,
or constant stooping, such as is used by a

The moving power of the vertebra, or 1
back bone, consists in several layers of
muscles. On each side of the spine is felt 1
a mass or cushion of flesh, the muscles of !
which are attached to various projections
from the individual bones (vetebra.) By
the joint and concurrent action of these mus- '
culur masses, the vertical position is main

tainerl, ana according as one 01 omer mue, <
or a particular portion of cither, contract*, 1
the body i* bent in that direction. The (
muscle* on the front part of the body bend 1
it forward, when they are called into con* 1
traction by volition.
Now it must be very obvious, that by a 1
long voluntary contraction of the muscles 1
on one side of the back bone, as when we
lean in that direction for a length of time,
in writing or drawing at a desk, or when 1
eng.igod at some particular handicraft em> 1
ployment. they acquire, eventually, a dis- f
eased habit. They become in a measure 1
permanently contracted?while those on the
opposite side, from heing in u s'alo of rest,
become weaker than natural, and are unable
to draw the spine to their side, and to
restore the vertical position. The effect of
this posture is, as already said, to compress '
the intervertebral clastic substance on the
side towards which the body leans, and finally
to render it firmer and thinner than
on the opposite side. There is then formed
a lateral curvature, which becomes fixed
spinal diisorion, and a raising of the shoulder
on the same side with the prominence
of the spine.
The natural consequence of sitting long
in the same posture, is an attempt to leaning
a little, to one or the other; and hence
a risk of deformity in young persons, who
are kept too long u time in school, of ac.
quiring a permanently false attitude, and
of suffering from spinal deformity. The
risk will be increased, if the person be of a
feeble and sickly liabit of body and ollowcd
to sit long in such a position, as to throw
ap one of the shoulders and the ribs of the
sume side.?Journal of Health.

Postcripl of a letter, dated,
New Orleans. Sept. 13.
Our friend J110. H. Miller, Esq. has this
day returned from one of his Cotton Plan,
tationsat the Attakapus, upon which the
Army worm have almost entirely destroyed
his crops. It usually yields 400 bales, and
this season he will not gather more than 50
to 75 bales. It s.vecps off 100 acres in a
single night, leaving the naked stalk, without
leaves or boles. In every part of our
State it is extending its ravages, und in Mississippi
it has made its appearcnce, and it is
expected it will prove equally destructive
there.

pipe in his mouth, turned up an emiy barrel
which proved to have a keg nearly full of
powder under it, the head of the keg being
out. A spark from his pipe fell into it, and
by the explosion, the unfortunate man was
perfectly flayed from his hair to within
about four inches of his ancles, and pieces
of flesh from two to four inches in circumference
fastened like wafers to the side of
room ! the whole of the clothes except the
waist bands of his pantaloons, was blown
ofT, his facA first charted and left black as

was unfinished. There were nine large

house was fired and consumed, the wind being
favourable to save the house.

It seems, however, that Constantinople
is not without the possibility of continued
conspiracies against the Sultan, which miglit
create a diversion in faror of Mehcmel, and produce
a general conflagration. Khosrew
Pacha, who has been exiled for conspiring
to dethrone the young Sultan, has found pa
rti/,ans to continue the work which had'*
dropped from his hand; but this second con*
spiracy had also failed, and fifteen hundred ^
of the pasons implicated havo been thrown
into the sea, with the appendage of a stone
hanging from the neck of each. Twenty
thousand Albanians are sent for to garrison
Constantinople. The object of these attempts
is to prevent the cstabishment of the
new constitution for putting Turkey, on a
level with the kingdoms of Europe, which
the Pachas find to be the destruction of their
power.
