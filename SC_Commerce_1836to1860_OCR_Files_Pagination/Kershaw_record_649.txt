of the Charlssan Merenry.
Washington. May 3, 1542.
Senate.?A report was received frnni ii;c
Secretary of the Treasury, in reply to a Itesolution
of the Senate, station that (here had been
received bv the public officers ni'd.-r the Act of
Jn?v 4, 1840, under the Act cs-.ibiijdjin;' tiio In'tependent
Treasury, revenue:;!:: the amount of
17,030,813, and that ho v? s ? lA'prir.od that
any defalcation had occurred. Tin? value of Ike j
coinage at the mint, rince i'x- Cjiahiioiuijcnt was
stated to be 863,310,404. J
Mr. Merrick called the r.ien of the Sen-1
ate to a subject upon which tho bcnatur irons
Missouri [Mr. Beeton} had made some remarks
yOsterdaj'?he alluded to the publication of certain
loiter?, which had hcon transmitted from
one of the Departments in relation to a nomination
now pending1 in Executive session, lie!
t hoped that the Scuttle would prescribe soma rule ,
of action in these1 matters that might govern I
hem hereafter; es he apprehended that the|
Executive hereafter might decin himselfjustifiable
in refusing to furnish documents of confiden- i
tial character, unless ho had c-or.ie assurance'
that they would bo regarded as such by the Sen- J
* ale.
Mr. Benton replied that the documents inj
question were not received from the President,
nor were lliey of a confidential character.? |
They were letters on file in the Post Office Department,
or in the language of the Post Alas-j
tef General, they were "archives of JJtlic office." j
As such, he had a perfect right to copy them, I
9- .and finding that they contained untruths respect- J
* ing one of his constituents, he Jiad copied them, I
and forwarded them for publication to St. Louis,'
where the falsehoods would be exposed and,j
punished. lie had reason to believe there were , i
other letters on file in the same office cf like > '<
character with those sent to the-Senate, which j <
he would ask the Post Master General to permit
him to examine; and should that officer re-! <
fuse to do so, he would inform the President of 11
the fact, and thus bring the question to an issue : i
how far this Government was to be a secret and I
irresponsible one. He would push the matter ji
* further when the nomination of Mr. Churchill j i
came to be acted on in Executive session. He <
would then expose the infamous falsehoods!i
which had been used to procure the removal off 1
the present incumbent, and he would write out j c
his speech in full and publish it. The morning1 j t
hour having expired, Mr. Benton yielded the j 1
floor, with a promise that he would renew the j d
aobject to-morrow. a
The Appropriation Bill was taken up, the 11
.question being the motion to strike out of the !
appropriation to make up a deficiency in the con- j T
tingent expenditures of the House of Reprcsen-) t
tanves, the word "books." Mr. B., in support j s
of this motion said, that most of the corruptions j c
and abuses in the expenditures of the public t
money, are covered up under the head of con- j t!
tingencies and incidentals. In the item now! a
under consideration, So3,000 was appropriated a
for books which members had voted to them- j i'
selves, and which there was no more reason in d
charging to the incidental or contingent cxpen-; ti
ses of the House, than the bills for any other n
portions of their private libraries. By this abuse si
a sum which would defray the expenses Cf the t,
Senate during the short session, was voted to p
members in the last hour of an expiring Con-' tl
gress. He thought the public attention should it
be attracted to these facts, and with that object a
had moved to strike out the item in the bill, that o
It Tntt'~ J??1?r-r^ and independent
proposition. ^ , t]

appointed, without the consent of the Senate, or : ai

Resolution at the instance of Mr. Clay, that the oi

A PROTECTIVE TARIFF?THE ARGUMENT
RASED ON NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE
EXAMINED.
One of the most, common arguments used in
favor of a protective TariiF is that it promotes
National Independence.
Independence is a captivating word. To patriotic
Americans if. is particularly so, being ascociated
with tlie idea of liberty and glory. It
has probably never occurred to one ifi a thousand
\vlio advocate a Protective Tariff, to inquire
whether the kind of Independence meant by
them, is in itself a good thing.
The Eagle in his eyrie on life inaccessible j
mountain cliiij is independent He sits lonely
and surveys the world below with which he forms
no associations, and never enters it but for plunder.
Is this an independence to be envied or
imitated!
Tlie Hermit who lives in his cave, subsists
upon roots and nuts, holding- no intercourse with
his felloW men, is independent. But is that an
independence which nations ought to covet?
The Chinese Empire admits foreigners only
at a single port, prohibits ils people to visit foreign
lands on pain of death, sells its products to
such only as come to buy, receiving little but
gold and silver in return. Thus she protects
her labor, and is independent; but is that such
in independence as Tariff men seek for Republican
America?
Society is in a stale of dependence?of happy
lependenco. The wife is dependent on the husland,
and the husband on the wife. The child
s dependent upon the parent, and the parent on
:hc child. Brothers, sisters, and relatives arc
uutually dependent. Neighbor is dependent,
ipon neighbor, one trade or occupation upon olhirs,
the city upon the country and the country
ipon the city, state upon state, and nation upon
lation. Without dependence, society could not '
txist; there could not be families or nssociaions,
laws or property, civilization or religion.
To destroy dependence is to break up the founlations
of all the Christian, the Philanthropist,
nd the Democrat cherishes most dearly, and .
brust mankind back into the savage state. i
The dependence is based on mutual interest. <
The man and the woman love each other, and <
0 promote their mutual happiness, rush into a i
tate of dependence. By pursuing different oc- f
upations and learning different trades, men make i
hemselves dependent on each other and find 1 (
heir interest in that dependence. One farm is I \
dapted to the production of one article and j
nother of another; the owners find their interest 11
1 exchanging; yet it produces a slate of depensnce.
One climate is adapted to the produc-1 j
on of one article and another of another, and ; t
ations find their interest, comforts and plea- j t
sres promoted by exchanging; and yet it makes ' s
lem dependent. Differences in the soil, in I q
opulaticn or in other circumstances, produce j
ie same effects in the same latitudes; and shall j c
lankind forego their interests, their comforts 1 d
nd their pleasures merely that thny may boast t.
f their independence? t
It is not an unreasonablcj?qfk*rcr-nre "
lat nationaLdcncade^s ttrpemlenc on i
rcrr^nierrv.-crc so complete, that they could r
ot quarrel without annihilation, there would
aver be a war between them. The greater
ie suffering a nation is certain to inflict on it- ,
}lf, the less likely it is to make war on its neigh- i
jr. In proportion as mutual dependence in- (
?? dniMmfw,, Himinishes. And is L
wOBVDf Llivj v. T.f* ? __
mt nothing in the estimation of the Christian !
orld? . IJ
But the United States is the last nation which '
jght to interrupt its trade with other nations on j ^
le ground that it produces a state of depen-! ^
jnce. Being chiefly an agricultural people, we ^
e from that circumstance sufficiently indepen- .
ml of every nation with which we deal, if at ^
ly time, by war or other contingency, our inircoursc
with them is interrupted, we have but
> fall back 011 our agricultural resources in
hich we may find all the means of subsistence
id comfort. The article of clothing which we ^
:ceive from abroad, we can immediately subsli- .1
itc by household manufactures, and the .articles 1
F luxury, we can dispense with. It is impossi- 1 n
le to produce serious distress among the great e
ady of our people through the dependence which . ^
ade, however free, may produce on foreign na-1 u
ons. Ie
It is not soon the other hand. Nations who' I
0 not produce their own food or the raw mate-11
al used in extensive manufactories, are liable I
1 be thrown into great distress by an interrup-! F
011 of commercial intercourse with those coun-,'
- ? 1 ?* ?1 /-> . 1 1
ics whence their supplies are ueriveu. vireat irilain
obtains tbc cotton which she uses in her 1
xtcr.sivc manufactories chiefly from the United jN
Hates. If tlie supply were cut olF, our planters ' I
ouhl easily turn tlielaborof their hands upon , 1
bjects which would give them a comfortable *
ubsistence, hut it would be otherwise with Brit- j ^
sh manufacturers end their operatives. The 1
manufactories would stop and the hands employ- j ^
d in them be reduced at once to a state of star- :
ation. The eflbct would be similar upon that j'
:ountry and others with which we trade, from i1
;uddcn!y cutting off the supply of bread-stuffs 1
ind provisions which we send them.
America has nothing to fear from the depen-11
lence which trade creates. The mutual mischief |1
)roduced by interruptions of commercial inter- i'
tourse, will always fall with superior weight on |
jur enemy. In a contest to see who can do tho j
>lher th?- naost harm, it is one of our most effec- ;
ivo weapons. If the British laics obtained all
heir raw materials and their bread from the U.
States, paying for them in articles of clothing,
is they do now a inrgc portion of them, to make
,var upon us would be an act of su'r-ide. As a
matter of self-defence, therefore, insleai! of interrupting
and diminishing our trade with hcr?
we should foster and increase it in every practicable
way.
In fine, national independence, even when it
amounts tooutter seclusion from the commerc'al
world, brings with it no exemption from war. To
this truth the shades of the Incas and Montezumas
bear witness. It is confirmed by the Hindoo
and Aflghans. Even now, British cannon
are thundering round the coast of China, notwithstanding
the commercial independence of
the Celestial Empire.
Commerce, though sometimes leading to carnage
and conquest, has not, on the whole, increased
wars. On the contrary, the spirit of
commerce is opposed tp war, and it has actually
diminished that calamity, especially between
commercial nations. The wars it produces are
chiefly in cases where only one of the parties are
commercial. Among the commercial nations ot
9 ;
Europe, it tends to the preservation of peace. |
'When Asia and Africa shall enjoy the benefits
of free trade with the civilization and power it I
always brings in its train, they will only enjoy
an exemption equally beneficial. Great Britairt l
will no longer come up from the South Sea and j
Russia down from the frozen north, crushing j
tribes, now as inclenendent of supplies from j
abroad as a tariff man'could wish, for the avowed
purpose of checking the power and influence of
each other. They will each be driven back to
their appropriate home: the people of Asia and
Africa, through the benefits of free trade, will
respectively govern their own continents and
sctlle down into "a family of nations," mutually
I dependent on each other,'and in an equal degree
I exempt from the calamities of war.
The appeal to the spirit of independence in
support of a Protective Tariff*, is an appeal to
feeling, and not to reason. It touches noble impulses,
but does not move sober judgment.
When reason shall be with us the sole governing
impulse, it will cease to be urged. A little reflection
will now satisfy every intelligent man
that, it is anti-republican, anti-philantlirophic,
and anti-christian. A. K.
LATEST FROM MEXICO[From
the N. O. Picayune.']
From Mala moras.?The schooner Water
Witch, arrived last night from Matamorae, which
place she left on the 19th intrt. Capt Arnoux
informs Us t hat a rumor was current there to the
effect that a body of Tcxans were encamped 150
miles above the city-?that 1000 Lepan Indians,
supposed to be acting in concert with the Tcxans,
were in the neighborhood, and had killed several
Mexicans.?The greatest alarm prevailed
in Matainoras?the inhabitants being apprehensive
that.their troops could not maintain the town
in opposition the so large a force.
Col. Kinney and two other Texan renegades
had arrived at Matainoras. The Colonel stated
that he had a narrow escape from a party of Texans,
who pursued him as far as Laguna. Col.
K. had boon sent for by Arista.
The Water Witch was chased on the 22d by
a schooner, which proved to be the Wm. Penn
from Mobile, bound to Texas, with a large number
of volunteers. The W. hoisted nor flag,
wmcn naa ute enect 01 causing a ceasauuu ui tuu
pursuit.

From Mexico.?Letters received here from
Mexico, says the Courier of last evening, Mate it
,vas understood there that the Captain General J
if the Island of Cuba has ordered a Spanish fri- (
jate and sloop of war to the .Mexican coast, with
nstructions to protect the merchant vessels of
Spain against the paper blockade lately proclaimed
by Texas; and it is added that the Spanish
Haptains have orders to'sink any Texan cruiser
vhicli may dare to capture a Spanish vessel.
Extract of a letter from Matamoras, bearing
late April 17lh: ]
"Santa Anna is much dissatisfied with Gen.'1
Vrista, and disapproves of the late demonstra- (
ion against Bexar. He has sent orders to Gen. '
Ara!l to go immediately to Monterrey, and asume
command of the brigade placed under Vas[uez
for the protection of the frontier.
";The garrison of; Matamoras is daily rcinfored.

The Burlington Iowa, Murder.?A correspon- t
cnt of the St Louis New Era, gives some fur. t
her particulars of this shocking affair: t
"It seems that Mr. J. Bradstreet, and of the|e
lost respectable citizens of that town, express- t
d himself freely in regard to Mr. Bridgman.? "
Vm. G. Ross, brother-in-law of Bridgman, took I
p his quarrel, and accosted, abused and assault- e
d Bradstreet at the Post Office, upon which y
Jradstreet drew a pistol and told him to desist r
toss immediately left, prepared himself with a b
arge canc and one of Colt's six brrel revolving ii
iiptols, and stationed himself at a point at whicn ie
would meet Mr. Bradstreet on his way to tea. c
Vt about half past five Mr. Bradstreet left his v
oom and proceeded down the street, when he n
vas again met by G. W. Ross and John W. n
loss at the cross street near the Post Office, v
loss remarked?"Now, sir, I am prepared to t;
iglit you;" 1o which Mr. Bradstreet replied?"I b
vant nothing to do with you sir; I have settled t
ny difficulty with Mr. Bridgman." Upon which o
[loss raised his cane with his left hand and fired ]i
i pistol at him with his right, and continued to 1:
lischargcd the barrels as fast as it was possible b
to do so, and five out of the six barrels exploded, s
One ball took effect on the top of the head, one i
in the side near the nipple, passing through one i
af the lobes of the lungs, and the third through ?
the right loin and kidncv. Bradstreet, after hav- j a
ing received his antagonist's fire and retreated c
some distance, wheeled and fired upon Ross, r
wounding him in the left breast near the nipple, (
two balls taking effect in his breast and t he third c
in his arm. Mr. Bradslrcet died of his wounds at i
about 12 o'clock on the 21st Hess was still lin- i
gering, without the slightest hope ofhis recovery e
The jury on the body of Mr. Bradstrect retnrncd (
a verdict of murder by the hands of said William i
G. Ross as accessary to the crime. John W. was i
immediately apprehended and remanded to prison.
The community is excited to an unparalleled dc- '
gree.
Extreme Suffering be Sickness.?The
Glouceste," Telegraph gives an account of the
sickness of Mr- Paul Conck, a preacher of Ncwburyport,
who dieJ in March last. He had been
afflicted with a severe chronic rheumatism for 38 .
years, and totally unable to help, himself, and was
obliged to use anodynes in large quantifies to
procure the least relief from his torttfre. In
some usances he used six teaspoons frill per
day.
In October, 1815, he took to his cfc^mber, 10
feet 6quare, of which he lias not, in a solitary instance
crossed the threshold, till carried to his
long home. At the close of his disease, it was
I the 30th year of his close confinement; and s;no"!

RHODE ISLAND. ^ 't
In the Senate to-day, Mr. Allen endeavored tc
get up his resolution calling'on the President foi
information in regard to the Rhode Island proceedings,
in which he has ieinhrdfled this Covernment.
Mr. Allen stated, as tie motive for renewing
his motion, the fact that the Executive had ordered
a part of the standing army to settle the
political differences in that State, and insisted
that it was the duty of Congress to ascertain ir
what way the public force was about" to be employed,
and to arrest, if possible, any use of il
which might tend to provoke bloodshed. From
the report of proceedings, in another column it
will be seen thatavery extraordinary course was
pursued to prevent any explanations on this
threatening subject
The Boston Courier (an old Federal paper)
has the good sense to unite wi'h the Democratic
press in Rhode Island and throughout New England,
in declaring that the attempt to resist the
popular movement to establish a Republican
constitution in lieu of the present Colonial charIcr,
the gift of a King, must and ought to prove
unavailing. The Boston Courier takes the
ground that a popular constitution must and will
be carried. The land-holders' party, which assumes
to have a vested right in the State sovereignty,
in consequence of the corporate privileges
bestowed upon them, by virtue of the King's
charter, are but provoking a civil war, which
must draw upon them tho abhorrence of the
whole Union, by standing out against the authority
of the majority of the people, assuming
that the freeholders, who are interested in keeping
power in their own hands, can alone gives
constitution.
The principle thus asserted by them?atwai
with all American theory and practice? is sufficient
of itself to make the great body of the people
spurn any sort of constitution which this
privileged class might ordain. The land-holders
seem conscious that this position is not tenable,
and therefore assert that the great majority obtained
for the free suffrage constitution was not
fairly obtained. As they venture to put their
repudiation of the constitution on this ground,
to secure the countenance of their countrymen
in other States, why do they not at once propose
to have the question again fairly tried at the
polls] This would settle the controversy without
bloodshed, and save the nation from the scandal
of having the standing army of the United
States interposed to arbitrate a political issue.
We think the President and Jus advisers, ana me
Rhode Island aristocrats, who have invited this
disgraceful exhibition, will have cause to repent
die part they may play in it.?Globe.

ANOTHER EXTRAORDINARY CASE OF BIGAMY! !
The present is a critical and doubtful ago?
amous for every species of villany and rascality;
nrtue retrogades notwithstanding the march of
ntellect, and deeds black and damning are daily
:ommi(ted in the midst of civilization. Well
nay the philanthropist weep as he contemplates
.he"depravity of the times, and, had virtue a
:ongue, well might she exclaim "rescue! ressue!"
in tones of seven-fold thunder.
It appears that a man, named Edicard (not the
edoubtable Edward C. Boiling), A Callaham
ivas arrested in ltoxbororough, Person county,
in Thursday morning last, and committed to jail
H'.dcr l.'ic charge of Digamy. The particular?,

ivife; but she died some time afterwards, and our
'hero" emigrated to Pittsylvania, Va., where,
Christmas before last, he married again?sclectngfor
his "better half," Miss Martha Harvey, a
roung lady of fine respectability. It would apiear
however that they did not live long in wedock
ere he converted its joy into misery?he
vhipped his wife occassionally, and such ultinately
was his fiendish cruelty, that his wife arestcd
him and very properly committed in custoly,
where he remained but a short time, only, in
onscquence of giving bail. Thus manumitted,
ie left his wife and located in Roxborough,
vhcre he commenced prosecuting the branches
f his profession?(Tailor)?and where he sue
:eeded in gaining the affection of Miss Martha
effries, a lady of amiability and much respeced,
who, on Thursday evening before last, in the
ull consciousness that he who woo'd her was
inencumbered by any matrimonial ties, other
han those she was about to rivet herself, gave
he base and treacherous man her hand, and solranly
vowed with him, at Hymen's polluted alar,
to "take him for better or for worse," and
to forsake all others and cleave unto him."?
lut mark the progress of Justice: His "hony-moon"
shone gloriously but a little while?on
esterday morning at 1 o'clock a rap at his bedoom
door disturbed his repose, and a consicence
lack with guilt penetrated his callous heart and
ifused in it a thousand fearful, torturing pangs
-but it was impregnable to shame! The uneremonious
knocking at the door and the tumult
without?what could it all mean! Instantly
lcmory flashed over the past and revealed him a
lonster more terrible than the midnight assassin
,'ho laughs recklessly as he bears aloft the faal
dagger reeking with innocent blood!?His
old, daring heart, steeped in the foulest corrupion,
shrunk back as he approached the door to
;reet the multitude! and lie paused are he unpriced
it!?but what could he do! whither could
ic fly! tlicrc was no escape! Justice stood close
>y! j)ale and trembling, he opened the door!
tout arms clasp'd him and bore him off to jail.?
Such a change! But yesterday and he revelled
n the luxuries of the "honey moon"?to-day that
'nioou" sunk to rise no more! But yesterday,
ind a fair and virtuous woman caressed and callid
him huslinrul?to-day, she spurns, despises,
uid calls him villain, robber, murderer! Yesterlay's
sun went down, and lie reclined on a bed
>f down in fancied security from detection and
ntcrruption?but the morning's sun found him a
.vrctchcd and degraded inmate of a filthy offensive
prison, 6trolched (perhaps) upon the hard,
;old lloor, clanking the culprit's chains: Such
is the destiny of base dishonor, and vice. Justice
will triumph.
Callaham is about SO years of age, a man of
irnntonl annearance. and of, hitherto, fair
? ? jr t," i i character,
when whipping his wile is excepted.
These particulars we have gathered from a brother-in-law
of his, by his second wife.

U* We would advise the people of the South
to be cautious in placing reliance upon promises
contained in publications put forth by individuals
at the North, to recover negroes who have runaway
and reached the free states. The advertisers
state that they have agents in all of the
fnurnH nnit trho nrfi ronotanfltf nn the look
out for runaways, so that is impossible for tliem
to escape. But in every casd where their services
are required, from 20 to'50dollars must be
remitted. We heard lately of gentleman in a
neighboring State, who employed one of these
fellows to catch one of his negroes who had
runaway, ahd as he thought, made his way to
the non-slaveholdiag states?the fee was sept on,
and in'a 6hort time a letter received stating
that the negro was discovered, and would soon'
be arrested, but that, it was necessary to have
$100 more, and that two or more persons must .
be in readiness to identify the negro as rcon
his owner should get notice of his arrest, which r
would take place immediately on the receipt of the
money, and a power of attorney, sent to the >

in prosecuting the claim. The power and mo- '
ney were sent on?buf nothing more was heard
of the agent A few days ago, the negro was
caught within ten miles of home. ''
