deep pathos-and impassioned eloquence.
In the course of his remarks, he caused 16

General Washington during the war, rela
tive to the economy of his table. The let
ter grew out of a proposition respecting the
invitation of some ladies. Among other
matters he refers to the iron eating plates
of his. camp chest. When the clerk came
to this portion of the letter the said iron
plates were taken from the chest and ex
ibited- to the House.. What a specimen
of the simplicity of the man.! I must
question whether any of our present olli
cers could begbribed to eat from such
plates.
Mr. Adams concluded by submitting a
joint resolution, accepting the chest, and
making suitable acknowledgments.
After some appropriate. remarks from
Messrs. Wetherel and Kennedy, of Md.,
the resolution was adopted.
Mrs. Madison, accompanied by another
lady, availed herself of her privilege of a
seat on the floor.
Mr. McKay, in order to afford certain
members, who were absent on Monday,
an opportunity to record their votes on
the tariff bill, gave notice that on Monday
next, he will again move to go into Com
mittee of the Whole on the bill. He said
if the motion shall again fail,;he would not
renew it at the present session.
Mr. Hale, from the Committee on Com
merce, reported a bill providing for Ma
rine Hospitals at Pittsburg, Pa., and P'ort
land, Maine.
Mr. Ingersoll called tip his motion to
print 10,000 extra copies of a report from
the Committee on Foreign Affairs, in fa
vor of indemnifying the owners of the
Spanish Schooner Amistad for the illegal
liberation of their slaves. -
Mr. Giddings took the floor and made
an abolition speech, after which the sub
ject was laid over.
The House then resumed the considera
tion of the Western Harbor Bill.
A motion to strike out after the enact
ing clause being rejected, a motion to lay
the bill on the table was made and shared
a similar fate.
The question then being on the engross
ment of the bill, Mr. Weller asked to - be
excused from voting, on the ground that
the bill contained an item appropriating
money for the Illinois rivers, which appro
priation, he considered unconstitutional,
and establishing precedent which would
terminate in an-xbausted treasury and
direet taxation.
After some very, noisy proceedings on
points of. order, he withdrew his motion.
Mr..D.ouglas, and :many other western
members then made speeches, based on
similar motions. In the course of the dis
cussion, it was hinted that there had been
a combidation among the Ohio. Delega
tion to oppoiethe appropriation for the I
linoisRivWer This was denied, and many
warm'irdas were used. Finally,. Mr.
Holmeixpressed a hope that the angry
discussion .might cease.: Ho humorously
quoted the nursery lines,
'0 tis' a shocking sight to see
Children of' one family,-etc.
The question on the engrossment of the
bill was put and the result was-yeas 74;
nays 109. So, the bill was rejected. A
motion to consider was made and is still
pendig.'.April 19.
In the Senate, the Post Office Reform

The Senate was-not in session today.
I am told that the annexation treaty will
not be submitted to the Senate until Mr.
Dixon H. Lewis, who it is understood,
succeeds Mr. King,-shall receive his cre
dentials. .If with this vote there shall
not be two-thirds in favor of the annexa
tion, there appears little doubt but that the
President will try the experiment of a
joint resolution, which it is believed would
secure a majority in both branches.
Mr. Tyler was yesterday laboring un
der a severe cold. He is better to-day.
In the House, this morning, resolutions
were presented from the Georgia Legisla
ture, denouncing the Massachusetts reso
lutions relative to slave representation.
A bill was reported from the Districl
Committee, appropriating $28,000 for im
proving Pennsylvania Avenue. After at
inef'ectual motion to lay the bill on the
table, it was referred to a Committee ol
the Whole.
Great preparations are making for the
reception of Mr. Clay next week. The
various Clay Clubs of the District are t
have a grand procession.
Mr. Colt concluded his sub-marine ex
periments this evening, by exploding the
wreck of tke Styx and other vessels.
April 22.
In the Senate this morning there were,
as usual, memorials from various quarters
agaiut the annexation of Texas, or-an3
modification of the present tariff.
Mr. Wright presented a memorial from
the Chamber of Commerce of N. York
asking the establishment of a 'rancb min
at that place.
Mr. Buchanan presented resolutions
adopted at a great Democratic Tyle
Meeting in Philadelphia. The resolutions
approved the policy of the President witt
regard to the Texas question.
After the disposal of some other busi
ness of no general interest, the Senate
went into an Executive Session on the
Texas annexation treaty, which was sub
mitted this morning. It is understood thal
it was finally referred to the Committee
on Foreign Relations, by a vote of 39 to 4,
In the House, a motion by Mr. Duncan,
to re-consider the vote on- the passage of
the Western Harber Bill, was decided in
the negative.
Mr. McKay in pursuance of notice,
then submitted his motion to go into Com
mittee of the Whole on the Tariff Bill.
After a call of the House, to the surprise
of all, the motion to take up the bill pre.
vailed. The vote was yeas 104- nays 94.
It is understood that many opponents of
the bill voted for taking it up, because
they wished the majority to define their
position ou this subject previous to the
election.
The bill having been read, Mr. C. J.
Ingersoll moved to amend by striking out
"September next," the time fixed for the
bill to go into operation, and to insert
"January next."
He supported his motion on the ground
that unless proper notice should be given,
mercbants who have sent orders under the
present tariff' will be great sufferers.
Mr.- Rhett was anxious that the hill
should go into operation with the least pos
ible delay. It was intended for the ben
,fit of the people, without any regard to
particular interests.
' Several other members took the same
new.
The amendment was further opposed on
he ground that the revenue wottld suffer
rom the long notice proposed, because
Merchants from this time until Janunty
would order no more goods.
M r. Lewis thonght the better plan would
be first to ascertain whether the measures
could be carried, instead of wasting time
in debate as to when it ought to go into
>peration.
After further debate, Mr. McKay moved
arther to amend by inserting the 1st of
Fuly next.
This was vigorously opposed by Mr.
Winthrop and o:hers, on the .ground that
it would be "sprmging" a measure upon
the merchants v. hich niust result to the
ruitn of many.
Finally the amendment of Mr. McKay
was rejected by a large vote. -
The question was next taken on the
amedneut of Mr. Ingersoll, and it was
also rejected by a vote of yeas 44-nays
The first item of the bill was then read
as follows, "On all coarse manufactured
wool, the value whereof at the last port or
plice whence imported to the U. S. shall
e seven cents or under per pound, there
hall be levied a duty of 15 per centum
ad valorem,stead of the 5 per cntum
imposed 't~he act of 1842.
Mra nur moved to amend by sti
king out n ~d inserting "30" per cen
tum- - - ' - -
'On'this motion a deliate arose, in which
the general tariff polkcy was examined.
No question was taken.
As the bill will probably be debated for
wo or three weeks, the idea of an adjourn
iment on the 27th of May is relinquished.
-The Senate, after the reception of peti
tions and other unimportant matters, re
ii~ied the consideration of the tariff reso
lutions, which 'was- debated. until, a late
our. - 7
In the:- House, this -morning, after the
disposail of some unimportant business,
the tariff bill was resumed .in Committee
f the Whole.
Mr. Wright made-a speech in favor of
lowduties, andg tarift~based 'upon a sys
tem, a hidh tiit poorest man. .in the coun
try might undetstand.
Mr.- White of Kentucky followed. He
occupied his. hour by a speech in which
he undertook to defend Mr. Clay froihe
severalharges against him, which h~av~e
recently been. the subject of newspaper
controversy. Having several times yiel
ded -the Boor for explanations, Mr. W.
asked asia act of courtesy that the Coin
mitteewould allow him an additional
hour.'
This 'was refusod. and Mr. White re
sumed his seat. - At this moment some
words see utered Iin :an .under tone
beween -himn and' Mr.Rathbun of N. Y.
The latter then left lis seat - and struck
Mr. White- with -his'fist.s The blow wat
returned and- in an instant, as it were,
nearly every member in the House-. had
~joit-t trbggle S 'rae easid
ping-on .th'edesk, whileoitbers vigorously
pulling. away with a .view of separating
the. billigerents. It was a second edition
of the scene which occurred some.'sessions
ago; when Mr.Wise struck Mr. Stanley.
Your readers can better imagine the'scene
than I can describe it..
Mr. Hopkins, Chairman of. the Com
mittee of the Whole, kept thunderin, with
t tli mate and calling: order, but he might
as well have spoken to the winds.'
Loud cries of "Why don't the Speaker
take the Chair?" and the officers ran to
bis-private room to fetch him.
Meantime the struggle of a hundred and
fifty members, piled as it were in a heap,
was increasing.
At this juncture a flash was seen, and
the loud report of a pistol rang through
the Hall, with cries of "a man is shot ;"
and as many members are known to carry
weapons, it was feared a more deadly
fray was about to commence.
The Speaker having arrived, he took
the chair, and ordered the Sergeant-at
Arms to take the mace and do his duty.
So that officer took that beautiful emblem
of the moral strength of the Union, and as
he held it up, surmounted by the silver
eagle with outstretched wings, it was sur
prising to witness its effects. Men deaf to
every other appeal, reverenced this silent
monitor, and in a few minutes, compara
tive order was restored.
Mr. Drongoole moved that Messrs.
White and Rathbun be taken into custody
by the Sergeant-at-Arms, until action on
the matter should be taken.
Mr. White took exception to this, and
termed it an ignominous proposition. He
said it presumed that the parties were de
sirous of escaping an investigation of their
case and of abiding by the decision of the
i House.
Mr. Dromgoole disclaimed any personal
feeling in the matter. Ho said that he
had made the motion with a view of pre
serving the wounded dignity of the House
A long discussion followed, in which
several other matters were made, the prin
cipal of which was that, the whole matter
should be referred to a Committee with
instructions to report on the facts.
Messrs. White and Rathbun severally
rose and expressed their deep regret at the
occurrence. The latter freely acknowl
edged himself to blame, having acted from
the excitement of the momett, and ten
dered Mr. White his hand, which was
cordially accepted, amidst the most deaf
ening tokens of approbation.
The question still being on the motion to
refer to a Committee, Mr. Holmes rose,
and after some brief remarks which did
him great credit, offered a resolution set
ting forth that the dignity of the House
demanded the expulsion of both members.
This was finally ruled out of order, and
after further discussion, the whole matter
was referred to a Select Committee, with
instructions to report on the facts, with a
view of preventing partizan misrepresen
tations in the newspapers.
The man who fired the pistol is a W.
H. Moore, from Kentucky. It appears
that he was in some way attempting to in
terfere in the fray, whereon Mr. McCaus
lin, a member from Ohio, forced him out
of the Hall door. For this, .Moore fired
the pistol, but the ball missed i .aim and
wounded an officer of tie Iouse, named
Wirt, in the groin. The wound is not con
sidered mortal. Moore is in custody.
April 25.
In the Senate, there was an additional
influx of memorials against the annexa
tion of Texas, or any change in the tariff.
Mr. Fr'ancis presented a memorial from
the majority of the Legislature of Rhode
Island, protesting against the right claimed
by the House of investigating the validity
of the present charter of that State. It
was laid on the table and ordered to be
printed.
In the House, an ineffectual motion was
made to suspend the rules for the purpose
of giving Mr. White an opportunity of
making some remarks relative to an edi
torial article in the Giobe wvhich gives an
account of the warm words which led to
the fracas yesterday. Many members
voted against the suspension, because they
were averse to a re-agitation of the sub
ject, and more especially as thme whole
subject has been referred to a Committee.
Moore, the man who fired the pistol is
still in custody, and will remain so until
further action of the House.
The consideration of the tariff bill was
then resumed in Committee of the Whole.
Mr. Brinkerotf made a strong speech
in favor of the agricultuiral interest, and
against the protection of manufactures.
Messrs. Wetnerel, Morris, Kennedy, of
Md., and H unt, severally spoke against,
the bill, Trhere was nothing original in
the argtuments. The debate is so dry that
very few members remained, in the Hall.
I am told that Mr.- Clay has sent on for
publicatien, his letter against the annexa
tion of Texas. IL ,vill probably appear
to-morrow.

From the Charleston Mercury, April 22.
MEETING OF THEDEaIocaATIc REPUB
LICAN AssocIATroN.
Pursuant to public notice, a very no
merous meeting of the Democratic Asso
ciation was held at the New Theatre on
Tuesday evening last. The Theatre was
well filled, both in the upper and lower
portions of that spacious building. At
the appointed hour, the Association was
organized by the appointment of the Hon.
H. L. Pinckney as Chairman of the Meet
ing, who opened the business of the meet
ing by a brief address,-in which he ex
plained the principles and objects of the
Association, and urged upon the Demo
crats of St. Phillips and St. Michael's,-the
importance and necessity of supporting the
Democratic party of the Union, in the
great contest in which they are now en
gaged with the Whig leader and his party.
Agreeably to the order of arrangements,
the meeting was then addressed ably and
eloquently by J. D. Richardson, R. W.
Seymour, Wm. D. Porter, and T. 0. El
liott, Fsqr's. The speeches of those Gen
tlemen were all of a highly iuterestirg
character, and were listened to by a grati
fied assembly, who frequently interrupted
them with loud and enthusiastic plaudits.
Mr. Richardson said, lie regretted that
the Committee of Arrangements had ap
plied to him to address the party-ho had
hoped that others, who were more prac
tised in the political arena, would have
been called upon to exert their powers
but he had thanked the Committee for the
opportunity now af'orded him, not of ma
king a public speech, but of publicly iden
tifying himself with the great movement
in which the Democratic party were now
engaged-for the opportunity, of declaring
himself to be one, tho' the least of those,
who were pledged to uphold and defend
the D)emocratic cause. He reviewed the
leading measures of the Whig party, and
pointed out their operation upon the in
dustry of all classes of the people. We
were in no better situation now in respect
to the Tariff, than before the passage of
the Compromise Act. We have the same
cause of Free Trade to defend,-the same
unconstitutional and oppressive Tariff to
resist. Mr. R. spoke at length upon all
the measures which characterized the Fed
eral party, and showed, that while they
were ruinous to the people, generally, they
were not entitled to the merit of confer
ring benefit upon their own party. The
advantages, if any would result, would
be confined to a very small portion of their
own party. He, next expounded the prin
ciples of the Democratic party. They
were the reverse of those proclaimed by
the Whigs. The fundamental principle
of the party-one upod which they never
could be divided-was :a strict adherence
to the Constitution. He drew a contrast
between the effects which must result from
the different principles of the two parties,
and called on the people to choose be
tween them. Mr. R. adverted to the
common jest which is beard from our op
ponents that the Democrats of this State,
would prefer Mr. Clay to any Democratic
nominee, except Mr. Calhoun. That Mr.
Clay was their next choice-next only to
their own great Statesman. He said it
was true, the Whigs were most anxious
to propagate this opinion, and in return for
it, many will be heard to say, that next
to Mr.'Clay, they would prefer Mr. Cal
houn. He said, we want no compromise
of opinions or measures with that party.
We had trusted to a compromise with
them once, and its faithless violation has
forever destroyed all confidence in theta
Mr. R. pointed out the absurdity of the
notion that Democrats could be brought to
support, direc-ly or indirectly, the elev!a
tion of Mr. Clay ; that although they had
a preference for Mr. Calhoun to any other
man. it would be insanity itself to main
tain their preference even to him, at the
expense of the principles of the party. If
we cannot have our best friend, we cer
t ainly will not go over to our worst enemy.
Though we may rnot be relieved of our
burthens by the hand most ready- and
vigorous to do us service, we certainly
will not invite our burdens to he increased,
by the hand most prompt to do us injury.
le said, such taunts were produced by
our own inaction. We must co-operate
with our party, and not stand aloof. A
particular individual,, however high our
estimate of bim, is not indispensable to the
establishment of the Democratic princi
ple. The election of a. President is not
the ultimate aim of the party-it is only a
means of obtaining a further end-which
is the propagation-of our principles. If
the nommnee bea-Demnocrat, we are bound
to support him. He enjoined upon the
party a spirit of codcession among them
selves, to regard thief princlies of the
party, and not indiviasial leaders-and to
act up to that motto of the Association.
The meeting was afterwards addressed
by Col. Thos. 0. Elliott, who descanted
on the great drincipitls professed and sus
tained by the Demiocratic party. the man
ner in which they were assailed and
threatened to be overthrown by the soc
eess of the Whig party, and the necessity
of union anid sympathy amoiig its defen
ders, and proceeded to explain and illus
trate the principle, that the danger to lib
erty resulted not from assaults on per
sonal rights of citizens, but from the pow
r ful combination exercising usurped power
in imposing on the whole Unioti, initui
tos and oppressive measures, designed to
benefit exclusively the dormant party. He
portrayed the fatal progress of opinions
repugnant to the Constitution and danger
ous to the liberties of the country ; and as
it was displayed most signally by the fact
that principles and measures which but
recetl~y revolted the sense and feelinigs of
the country, were now used as the rally
ing words of the Whig party, and alluded
to the propositions to pay the debt of the
States, and distribute the public revenue
as Impressive.prooh of the correctness of
this view-and also alluded to the uncon
stitutional nature and tendency of a pro
tective Tariff,: amd described its effects as
an alarming inroad 'alike on the libertiet
and the interests oaf the States.
Col. B. F. Hunt si then Ioudly called
fore by the .neeting= -which laile adrd
athidst repeated cheering ua @ ppat e.
Col Hunt's remarks. are.o ntuedTr y
of roomn
-The meeting was thendaddrese' by 3ohn
F. Gordon, Esq., .in reply to f. l. .pui
from. whom hedifered as to. sme o his
remarks..
Mr. Gordon arose and asked the air
man, whether the Associations was-formed
for any other purpose, but to-riifryoot-atd
succesfui!vt maintain the principles of the;
Democratic party as prom lgaied. by the
Convention o11840, hld..in the city. or.
Baltimore. The Chairman was under
stood to say that it was- not. - Then, sir,
the gentleman who has Tas!addressedijs.
meeting, has introduced d .diineussd
topics which are calculated icits disi
trust and mar the harmony of tb6 Demo
cratic party; among other thingsi he cot
tends that we have no right to put upon
probation the Democrats of other portions
of the Union, who has swerved from the
true faith, and that there are those who
have swerved cannot be denied. & among
them are Messrs. Buchanan and -Wright.
It was by their votes in the Senate of the
United States, that the taritT of 1842 that
infamous and detestable measure, which
like a canker worm, is eating out the vitals
of the South, was' placed upon us. -Had
it not been for their votes, this measure
could never have passed, and our Senators
& Representatives in Congress would not
now be struggling in throw ofl this griev
ous burden. Have we then no right to
put on probation such men as those. Mr.
Chairman, if either of them were : by a
change of circumstances, to be nominated
by a Detmocratic Convention for President,
1, would not vote for either of them,
until they had atoned for the votes. given
by them on .the Tariff of 1842; yet the
gentleman is understood to say, he will
vote for any Derr')crat nominated by the
Convention. Not so with me, but if Mr.
Van Buren is nominated by the Conven
tion and remats steadfast and true to the
principles of 1840, then, Convention or no
Convention, I pledge him my humble and
cordtal support. But whilst the gentle
man contends we have- no right to place
upon probation the-Democrats of other
portions of the Union, he has himself
placed upon probation the Central Com
mittee, and such other. as agree with
them. Call you this consistency ?
Now, sir, they- have a right to doubt and
hesitate in their support, of a party, the
influential members of which have already
decided against them upon a great princi
ple, much the greatest of all now before
the people, save one, the annexation of
'Texas to the American Union, and that
has but recently been brought to the notice
of the American public, Let our motto
then continue to be "principles not men."
and we will all march forward in the
same common fight to share either victory
or defeat together.
Col. F. H. Elmore followed Mr. Gor
don on the same side, and amidst repeated
cheering, spoke in an animated strain.
Col. Hunt then made a brief reply in
explanation of his sentiments-after which
the Association adjourned, to meet again
on Tuesday evening next.

MEETINo OF THE DEMOcRATIC REPUBLI
BAN AssoctATioN.
The meeting of the Democratic Repub
lican Association, which convened in ptr
suance of public notice, at the New llThe
atre, on Tuesday evening last, was one of
the largest and most respectable that has
ever been brought together in the city.
Before the hour appointed had arrived,
the Theatre wvas full, and many departed,
not being able to bear and see with any
degree of comfort.
A t 8 o'clock, the meeting was organized
byv cnlling Dr. M. T. Mlendenhall to the
Chair, who in a few words explained the
objeci of the meeting.
The Hot. H. L. Pinckney then came
'orward and offered the following resolu
tions, and addressed the iaeeting at length
in their support.
Resolved, That we declare ourselves
unchangeably opposed to the principles of
the wyhig party, and to any candidate wvho
may be0 presen'ed by thatt party for the
office of President of the United States.
Resolved, That we continue, unchanged,
our opposition (o a Protective Tariff
to a Bank of the United States-to the
prosecution of a system of internal im
provemNents by the General Government -*
to the assumption of State debts by the
General Government-to the distribution
of the proceeds of the sales of the public
lands amongst the States-and to the abo
lition ofthe qualified veto of the President.
Resolred, That wve regar'd the annexa
tion of Texas as a measure of the greatest
public importance to the Southern !States,
and to the entire Union.
Resolved, That we consider it a matter
