A Legal Decision.-An action was
brought some time since, according to at
English paper, against a person-to recov
er damages on account of his dog having
worried some sheep belonging to a neigh
bor. It appears in evidence there were
two dogs engaged in this predatory excur
sion, only one of which belonged to the de
fendant, his counsel submitted whether his
client could beheld liable, as it was doubt.
ful which animal was the criminal. The
Judge held-that even if one was the prin
cipal. the other oere ascessory and there
fore both woereliable. They were conjoint
trespassers, and thorefore liable jointly and
severally. It was a remarkable circum
stance said his Lordship, but it was well
known that dogs agreed -together to go out
upon these marauding expeditions. Ver
dict for the plaintiff'.
New Invention-Mr. B. Vaden, of Bal
timore has invented a hinge for window
shutters, of an entirely new style, which
will enttially throw out all of the old fash
ioned oncs now in use. They are designed
to be stronger than the hinges ordinarily
used, and are so constructed that when the
-shutters open a small pin made for the
purpose, will effectually prevent the shut
ter from being blown about by the wind,
and when shut the insertion of the same
pin into the hinge prevents the shutter
from being opened. It can be furnished
as cheap as those in ordinary use, besides
which the cost of the fastening to the wall
to hold the shutter back, as well as the
cost of the bolt or spring is saved. The
necessity of protruding the arm out of the
window to fasten the shutter back, is also
avoided.
Short Cuts.-It has already been satis
factorily demonstrated that the canal across
the Isthmus of Darien will shorten the pas
sage to China many thousand miles, and
give as access to the pacific Ocean in a
short passage. The same disposition to
- encouroge short cuts should enable travel
ers to reach India without doubling the
Cape of Good Hope, in half the time by
crossing the Deserts of Suez. It appears
that the Oriental Steam Company have
divided seven per cent by their enterprise,
and have a surplus fund of ?44,800 ster
ling, which may be used to improve the
navigation of the Red Sea, as well as to
build a better line of Steamboats than those
now employed. We consider it a settled
point that all despatches from India will
come overland hereafter-the great interest
which England has a stake in the East re
quires the most prompt mode of comimu
nication. The Red Sea, which centuries
ego was the only highway of travel and
commerce to and from India, will now be
carefully surveyed, and depots for coal and
merebandize established. The entrance
at Babel-Mandel, not always safe,' will
will have Beacons and Lighthouses. and
the overland trade will be greatly in
creased.--N. Y. Sun.

the Hon. A. Dlurt.
The Weaher.-We liave been favored with
remarkable mild weather for the last two or
three weeks, which has brnight forth blooms
upon. fruit trees that are warm situations.
Our planters are busily ongaiged in breaking

l1JWe call the atention of ourr readers to
the communication in this day's piaper, over
the signature of "TuRKEY CREEK," upon the
subject of the Governor's election. :The writer,
we feel satisfied, speakwr the language of the
great body of the citizens o'f this District, upon
that all important mat ter, and justly points out
causes enough to produce an alteration in out
Constitution, that will not only give to thes peo
pIe, their right upon this p)oint, but upon various
others, that under its present form they are de
prived of. We have a hope, that the subjec1
will be agitated in every District in the State,
previous to the comning fall election, and should
it be the wvill-of the majority, that their repre
sentatives may be instructed accordingly.

it was an effectual cure:.
"First give a light emetic, then bind to the
woundsalt and red odions and keep the wound
scarified, so as to keeif in a mattered state;
then take 12 grains ofsublimate and put it in
one quart of whiskey, and take a wine glass
full three times a day. Bleed every second day.
Give a table spoonful of the juice of green plan

The Charleston Mercur'y of the 24th -inst.
says, upon the authority of the N. Y Herald,
that "the sales ofcotton during three weeks be
fore the departure of the Hibernia had amount.
ed to near 250,000 bales, and though this was
principally upon speculation, it appears that
the manufacturers too~had shared in the excite
ment and purchased considerably beyond their
weekly consumption. The stock of American
cotton in Liverpool was reduced to within about
100,000 bales of what it was last year.
"' It will be a grave matter to holders on this
side to determine what they shall now do. We
cannot but consider the further accumulaion
of the crop in our ports as to some extent haz
ardous. At present a general disposition to
ship, would probably be attended with an im
mediate rise in freights, and the longer the ac.
cumulation goes on the greater will be the rise
at last. And notwithstanding the acknowledg
ed shortness of this crop, there is even now
danger of its pressing on the next, to the injury
of the planting, as well as the commercial in
terest. On every account it seems to us that
present prices should be surtained, and the
crop allowed to go forward."

Altered Bills.-The Charleston Courier of
the.22d inst. says: " We were shewn yester
day, a one dollar note ofthe Bank of the State,
which had been ingeniously alte red to a five,
by pasting the letters and figures offire over one,
in several places on the face of the note. A
mong a number of bills, the deception would
not be observed perhaps, but if held up to the
light, face outwards, the original letters :and E.
gures are at once legible.
"We learn, also, that South Western Rail
Road Script, of the denomination of one dollar
are in circulation altered to three-and the $14
to $j. The public should be on their guard,
and detect the imposition."
Texas.-The N. O. Republican contains the
following paragraph, in confirmation of the ru
mors and assertions respecting the annexation
of Texas to the United States. We are a little
jubious of the truth of the statement, but are
not able, from any information in our posses.
sion to contradict it.
" Since the above was writlen, we have re
ceived the following particulars in relation to
the negotnation of the treaty for the annexation
of Texas to the United States. The source
from which we h-ave derived thema, is entitled
to the utmost confidence. Early in January, a
resolution was offered simultaneously in buthi
Houses of Congress of Texas, favor'able to its
annexation to the United States. In the Senate
it passed unanimously; and int thelower House,
out of 40 members, 36 voted in its favor ; 2 vot
ing against the resolution and 2 declitning to
vote st all. The result wassimmediately trans
mitted to the Executive of the United States.
Upon its being laid before the United States
Senate in secret session, thte actiotn of that body
was in favor of annexation by a vote of 40 to 9.
A treaty was thereupon drawn up and immne
dlately forwvarded to the Collector of this port,
with instructions, should there he no immediate
conveyance, to forward the despatch by ex
press with the least possible delay. ,The docu
ments reached here one day previous to the
last sailing of the Neptune, and by that vessel
was forwarded to the care of our charge d'af
faires, (sen. Murphy. theni at Galveston, wvho,
upon receiving it, imumediately sent it by ex
press to the Texan seat of government, mn the
hope that it would reach there before the ad
journmnt of Congress. In this, however, he
was disappointed. However previously to ad
journment, they passed a joint resolution au
thorising President H-ottston to confirm the trea
ty. Therefore the next news we may expect
to hear from that quarteris. that President Hous
ton has issued his proclatmation calling Con
gres together to ratify the treaty, in case the
Constituttion does not give him the necessary
power."
For the Adwertiser.
Mr. Eom-oa.-There seems to be some inter
estmanifested in several sections of the Smate,
uponr the next Governor's election; and the
present occasion furnishes a suitable opportuni
ty to of'er some remarks upon the proper mode
of electing a Governor. b'everal gentlemen of
high and dewerv-tng character have been pre
sented to the consideration of the public, each
one having attainments that would etninently
qualify them for the high ofieof a Governor.
Amidst the conflicting claimas which have been
set forth in favor of each of the gentlemen, the
enquiry is awakened, how shall we justly de
termine the relative merits of each competitor ?
It will be conceded that the Governor-elect
should be the choice of the majority of the vo
ters in the State, that lhe should go into the
Gubernatorial Chair with the undouhted testi
mony of the strong sanction of popular desire.
The present mode ofeleting our Governor by
the Legislature, has not in all instances fulfilled
this just expectation of the people. It may be
said, however, with deserved justice, that South
Carolina has been truly fortunate in securing
to her service niany of the noblest and moat
talented of her sons, who would have been sus
tained by the unquestioned sanction ofa popu
lar vote; provided that right had been extended
to this question, aniL f'ord eachamiralit idil
and' equitable decisin fti ftis merits, epio
pose'that this election '"'iiiild-go-directly hibe
foe-the-people. It iWbefore'tis tribunal that'
the claims of'each competitor shouldbeU i eelg
canvassed and 'discussed. and the successful
candidate having the evidence of.thekLnown
preferences of the people, would go into of
fice with that confidenceind protd-saftisfactiof,
which is so pleasing to. all the hobler sensibili
ties of our nature.. It-is duo-to the people, that
their choice for the highest office in the State.
should be known directly. -ie profess to be
a Democratic State, and why, not let.the prrm.
ary offices go to the people, which is the es
sence of Democracy.. The perpemuity of our
Government depends upon the.virttie and af
fections of the people; and there can -be no in
fluence which can more certaily command this
attachment of the people to tiheir government,
tfian a proper enjoyment of the high and just
right of voting for those who fill the highest of
fices. It may be said that the tendency 'of this
principle will serve to excite bitter party feel.
ings, and organize the State into a settled de
termination to effect every thing by party, rather
than upon principle. That it would destroy
that harmony and concord which is so desirable
to all classes of society. This reasoning would
strike at the very foundation of a free and de
mocratic government ; because it is made upon
the presumption that the people are iucompe
tent for self government ; that the priviledge of
voting for his excellency the Governor is not to
be committed to the common intellects of the.
humblercitizens of the country. We maintain
that there should at all times exist as intimate
and direct a connection between the people
and their representatives as practicable ;' this.
enforces a strict accountability, and servesto
correct all unjust measures, and restrains the
inclination to extravagant appropriations. We
entertain a belief that a proper enjoyment of
the elective priviledge conduces to the purity
and perpetuity of our government.; cicheck.
the invasions of the ambitious,-by removal from
office; it takes out of the hands of the vicious
and extravagant, the means 'whichdamipr
their indulgencies. It will be rcadilypeieive4;
that a higher estimate of our country ad itsin~
stitations, and of the inestimable value of liber.
ty would.;pervade all classes of society. 'Ou'r
government is one of voluntary association;
and demands from all incessant vigilance :to
maintain its peculiar characteristics; it is the
policy of Aristocracy, and all those opposed to
a Democratic government, to separate the peo
pie by insidious advances and gradations, from
a proper control over their government and 'its
officers; this is exhibited in the enactment of
indirect measures, which are the undoubted
instruments of disguised tyranny, and have for
their purpose an unjust exaction, which -would
not be submitted to. if their. odious character
was exposed. In the proposition to give the
election of the Governor to the people, we are
sustained by the example of nearly every State
in the Union. It further appears to us, that
it w ould be advantageous to the public in
terest, that the powers of the Governor might.
with propriety be enlarged, and the tenure of
his office should extend to four years, or re-eli
gible after the expiration of two years, this
would give time for the completirf of any sys
tem of measures, which his wisdnm might sug
gest, or the wants of the country require. We
are glad to see you Mr. Editor, manly assum
ing the position we have endeavored to main
tain, and we assure you of the cheerful sup
port of 'I'URKEY CREEK.

A Lotve Afair.-Quite a retnanric af
fair occurred recently at New Orleans.
arising out of the tender passion. A Dr.
Mackay courted the daughter of Judge
Story of that city. The lady gave .her
consent to the union, but the father said.
nay, and the pair started off in a carriage,
privately to Lafayette, to get 'spliced.
On the road they met the lady's brother,
who attempted to stop them, but was
pitched in to the mud by the driver. The
next obstacle with whtich they came in
colhission was not so easily got over, be
ing a heavy dray- and they were pitched
into the mud. As one of the horses was*
k-Wed, the carriage smashed, and the Jehu
"knocked into a cocked hat," the lovers
had to take to their personal powers of
progression. and they trudged back to N..
Orleans through mud and rain, in the hope
of finding an up river steamboat to bear
them to bliss. They found one, and em
barked, hut the family heard it, chartered
another boat, and at the last accounts, the
two steamers were 'goig it' up stream, at
a boiling gallop, while, the citizens 'on
shore were giving and 'taking odds on. the

deive:the 'many' set phrases that are amiotig

have a'ditTerent meaning than thos ithey
are iniended to convey.. It appears as if
mankind, by.comrmon consent, have agreed
td make.ase of phrasesto which noinean
ing should be attached, ' In onr fasiona
le. circles we-hear continually such pltra
ses as, these, "[am delighted to see you:
I hope you will honor us often with your
company." Though while saying thisf.
they wish the agreeable.visitor inHeaven
or hell, or some such place.

men are abusing each ~other by let
ters, they will be sure to sign them, "your
obedient servant." If a gentleman asks
a friend for a favor, the reply will gener
ally be, "nothing would dfiord me greater
pleasure than to serve you," but certainly
some excuse.
People are trying hard to polish them
selves out of their veracity. But if they
would consider that there -is not a more
shining virtue in the whole catalogue of
social virtues, than veracity, they would
soon mend their conversation, and only
say what they mean.
Plato says, there is nothing so delight
ful as the hearing or speakingof truth; For
this reason, there is no conversation so
agreeable as that of the man of veracity,
who hears without any intention to betray,
and speaks without any intcntion to de
ceive.
However, our forefathers in this respect
have been no better, and an English
preacher in one of his sermons makes use
of the folloning language: "The dialect
of couversation is now a days so swelled
with vanity and complitnents, and so sur
feited of expressions of kindness and res
pect, that if a man that lived an age or two
ago, should return into. the world again,
he would really want a Dictionary to help
him to understand his own language, and
to know the true intrinsic value of the
phrases in fashion." Had Dr. Johnson
lived lung enough, we might have been in
possession of such a Dictionary, for he ad
vised us not to interpret a young ladles no
by his English Dictionary. To comfort
my readers, and to convince them that our
forefathers were no better, I will subjoin a
letter, said to have been written in Kiug
Charles I. time, by the Ambassador of
Bantum, a little after his arrival in Eng
land.
Master. The people among whom [;now
am, have tongues further from their hearts
than from London :o Bantum, and thou
knowest that the inhabitants of one of
these places do not know what is done in
the other. They call thee and thy sub
jects barbarians because. we speak what
we mean; and account themselves a civ
ilized peopled becausethey speak one thing
and mean another. Truth they call bar
barity, and falsehood politeness. Upon
my first landing, one who was sent from
the King of this place to meet me. told me
that he wasextremely sorry that I had met
with a storm just before my arrival. 1
was troubled to see him grieved on my ac
count, but in.less than three months he
striled, and. was as merry if nothing had
happened.
Another, oho came with him told toe.
that he should be glad to do me any ser
vice that lay in his power. Upon which
I desired him to carry one of my portwan
taus for me, but instead of serving me ac
eording to his promise, ha laughedJ and bid
another do it. 1 lodged the first week at
the house of one who desired nte to think
moyself at home, arnd to consider his house
as my owns. - Accordigly, I the nexi
morning began ,4) knock downv one of the
walls of it, in onder to lot int the fresh air,
and hand packed up some of the househuld
goods, of which I intended to have muade
thee a present, but the false harlot no
sooner sawv ins falling to work, th~an he
sent worid to desire me to give oier, for
ihat he would have no'suchu doitngs itt hisa
house. I had not beepn long in the union
before I was told by~iic, for whom I htid
asked a great ra or fromu the chief of the
King's servants. that> Iliad eternally ob
liged him. I was sdjufrprised at ihis grat
itude, that I could not forbear saying,
what service is tirere which ora man cain
do for anothjer, that c::n oblige h:at to at!
eternit y! hlowever, I onily asked him. for
my reward, thatyrhe wdtid lend me his
eldest daughter during my: stay in this
country, but I uickly round that hec wa'
as treacherouis as the, rcst of his couatry
men. At my first going to Court, one of
the great imen almost put'mdant of coun
tenance, by asking teni thousand grardone
of me for only treading by ateJent upon
my toe. They call this kind of lire a comn
pliment, for when they arc civil to a great
man they tell him ainirrth, for whieli thu.'
would order any of thy officers of State to
receive one thousand blows upon the~ soles
of his feet.
-1 do not kno* ho~w I shall negotiate any
thinug with this people, as there is so little
credit to be given to them. Thou wvouldst
fancy that the whole nation are physicians,
for the question thiey always ask is bow I
do. I have thi, <juestion put to me about
one thousand times a day. Nay, they are
not only thus inuquisitive after my health,
but wish it in a niore solemn manner with
a full glass in their hands, every time I
sit with them at table, though at the samne
time they would pleasure me to drink their
liquors, whichr I have found by experience
will make me sick.
They often pretend to pray for thy health
also in the same manner, ,but I hate more
reason to expect it fromn thid .goodness of
thy Constituion,- than the sincerity of their
wishes.
-May thy slave escape in safety from this
doutile-tonguedl race of men, and live to
lay himself once more at thy feet in the

OBITUARY.
Mr. TrMPERANCE Porn PAYs, departed
this life on the 4th inst., leaving a bereaved
hushand with fsur children, to regret their un
timely los. She was born on the 13th of Oc
tober, 1800,.and lived nearly 21 years with her
husband. It is customary for. the living to fur
nish tit obituary tribute of respect to the mem
ory of their deceased friend, when such an
event is marked by pectuliar circumstances.
There is one consideration that would general
ly induce ds to be silent on such an occasion,
where no moral dud could be promoted, by fur
nishing such a commtlnication. 'Time is short,'
and the multitude is all hastening to the grave,
and where no marked peculiarities of character
distinguished the deceased, we cannot see any
good purpose subserved, by-holding up all, in
discriminately to notice. But, in our own pil
grimage, when we see a friend, who has occu
pied some notice in society, from his or her ele
vated moral course, we like to bold up such a
charactet to our view, as a beacon for our path;
and a model for out imitation, hoping also that
a spark diay by communicated, that williburn
in some other bosom, which will likewise shed
a light on society. Mrs. PAra discharged all
of the duties and relations of life devolving
upont her, in an eieniplaty and dignifed man
ner. She was iddusttiuus and pttdent in the
management of het domestic concerns; kind
and courteous to her husband; affedtionately
tender to her childred, admonishing them kind
ly, and instilling in them the ptecepts of vir
tie; and affable to her friends and neighbours.
She ass circumspect in her general deport
ment, and in iuipressing propriety and decorum
pt'evailed over all her actions. The tongue
was ito "unruly member" with her, and all her
desires and passions appeared to be brought
"into subjection." She was not disposed to
speak evil of any person. A happy equanimity
influencdd her conduct. No turbulence inter
rupted her tranquility. She was quiet, unlpre
tending and unassuming in her manners
Cheerful, ingratiating and conciliating; she
seemed peculiarly fitted; for smoothing down
the asperities and rough incidents of life. The
great lever that operated so happily in dontrol
ling her actions was unseen to the human eye.
Peace, yea a fall assurance ha dbeen imparted
to her from on high. She felt that she was
"the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God
dwelt in ier." She heeded the admonition,
"give thyself, and bind on thy sandals,", by at
taching herself to the Baptist Church at Fel
lowship, un Ite 13th of August, 1831; since
which timno she has continiued a reputable and
pious maemiber. SIte had been lalboring studer
the Liver co~inplaint for some years. She never
became aeriana~ly indisposed by the disease, un
