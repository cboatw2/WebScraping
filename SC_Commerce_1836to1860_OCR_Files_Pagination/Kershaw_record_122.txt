CAMDEN, 8. C. AUGUSTS, 1837~~~
Geo. Lam ait, Vice President of the Republic
of Texas, inivfd in this town from the North on
Tuesday last, and departed on the following day,
South.
OUR TOWN.
We hate been mueh pleased, ae the business
season approach*#, to see suoh ample preparations
making for it, a?-}? manifested in our town. The
commercial distress which has paralysed enterprise
in almost every section of the country, has certainly
not been without its influence here, but our
community has suffered less perhaps than many
.others. Indeed so little has it affected oar merchants
that not one have stopped, bat each and
every one are' preparing for a vigorous business
campaign the coming winter.
From every portion of the coufitry we have the
most cheering anticipations of an abundant crop!
and or merchants are preparing themselves to give
the products of the soil a hearty reception, and
amply to reward the producer for bia labor. Oar^
country"friends will, we have no doabt, find It
their intereat to give as a trial. Country merchants
from a large portion of the back country]
will find Camden too, one of the moat eligible j
places to which they cdn ship their goods from the
North, with a reasonable certainty of receiving
them early, and at moderate ohkrges. There will
be two fine new Steamboats plying regularly be
twcen Camden and Charleston during the approach
log season, which will render their reception here
snre and speedy. And we hazard hothing in saying
that the roads leading to Camden from the up
country are superior to those leading to any other
in land market in the State. We shall refer to^
this subject again.
Tho Chamber of Commerce of Charleston, have
resolved to sond twenty-tour delegates to the convention
to be held in Augusta, Georgia, in October
next, in pursuance of the recommendation, of
the Circular from Athens, which we pubi'shed
week before last. They recommend, howev?."
that the convention meet on the last Monday in
October instead of third Monday* We presume
due notice will be given, if the time is changed.
The subject of a direct trade between the cities
?i tne oouui anauie pons 01 Duropr, u une ui ?a?i
importance to the whole Southern country, and
we are gratified to perceive that it is commanding
merited attention. Will not Camden send a delegate?
BRIGADE ENCAMPM ENT.?The commissioned
officers and Betgeants of the 5lh Brigade,
South Carolina Nlilitin, will assemble at this place
on Monday next, for six days encam'pineat. An
excellent band of music, we understand, will be in
attendance.
BANKS AND BANKING.
Dr. Coopkr's article on this subject, in the last
*'Southern- l.ilerarxj Journal," to which we alluded
in our last has drawn forth a long, but interesting,
communication from Judge Cukves. it will be
recollected that Judge Cheves preceded Mr. Bid*
dle as President of the Bank of the United
Stales.
The communication of Judge Cheves is intended
chiefly to correct some of Dr. Cooler's factn
in relation to the course of the Bank during his
administration, and he triumphantly refutes the
charges evidently implied in those facts.
But the concluding remarks of Judge Curves,
though having no reference to the controversy between
Dr. Cooper and himself, are calculated,
coming from the source they do, to arouse the
public attention, and to set them, if v*e may be allowed
the* expression, to re-thinking. Many of
our most profound citizens and among them Dr.
Cooper himself, have heretofore held the doctrines
that a National Bank was not only inexpedient,
but unconstitutional; the recent derangement of
the currency and the consequent commercial em
barrassment and distress, lias however, changed
the opinions of thousands. Those of them who
have njl the most thorough conviction thnt it is
constitutional and indispensable, will be led to reflection
by the opinions ex tressed by Judge Ciievks
"We regret, with the editor of the Mercury, in
whose paper we saw the communication, that he
did give his reasons for tln? opinions expressed.?
They would, as he justly rem irks, be ''entitled to
the most careful consideration of the whole country,
not only as the views of a profound thinker,
but of a man who had with such signal ability directed
the vast machine, who had watched all its
operations, studied all its qualities, and knew by
experience all the good and evil that belong to
it."
The followinoM'e the remarks of Judge Ch f.ves
in his reply to otTCooper. "As to the late Bank
of the United States, I have but very general notions
of its transactions since I resigned. I have
been principally struck- with t'ie extent of them on
some occasions. I had no interest in it. If on
any occasion I susposed its course to be wrong. I
felt that it would appear illeberal ahd be inde licate
in me to become a critic of the conduct of my
successor. If in the struggles of the Bank to be
re-chartered, my opinion wa3 against it (as in facl
it was,) I nevertheless was silent. The relations
in whieh 1 had stood to it forbade me to manifest
. opposition to it, in any way, or in any degree. I(
is now no more, and I am free to declare that / am
opposed to a National Bank in any shape. / alway:
believed it to be unconstitutional, and my ezpericnet
and observation have satisfied me, that it is inexpe
dientrunnecessary and dangerous."
THE SEMINOLE WAR.?This glorious wai
whieh has added such brilliant and unfading Instn
to the American name, seems likely, we think now
to be brought to a close in the course of a year o
two more. Notwithstanding the consummate skil
and courage which his been exercised by our gal

The following account of the gale and
shipwreck, we copy from the Charleston
Patriot.
SHIPWRECK.
Apprehensions have been felt some
lime past for the safety of the schr. S. S.
Mills, Capt. Ely man, which vessel having
sailed irom St. Augustine for this port on ;
the 5th inst. must have encountered the
late gale. These apprehensions have been
unfortunately too fully realized as will be
seen by the following.
DARIEN, Aug. 11. i
Office of the Telegraph. )
Shipwreck?Fourteen lives lost.
A friend has favored us with the fol
lowing. The seaman, Mr. Cote, is in this
city at present, and substantiates the account.
St. Simons, Aug. 9.
A sailor by the name of Abraham Cote,
who says that he is,.he believes, the only
survivor of the St. Augustine packet schr.
S. S. Mills, of 90 tons burthen, bound to
Charleston, and upset off Jekyl Island,
in 7 fathoms water, and all perished but
himself. This melancholy disaster occurred
during the gale on Sunday the Gth instant,
about 11 o'clock in the morning.
There were oir board, fifteen in all, among
whom were one white woman and two
blackball drowned, in the cabin. Mr.
Cote reached Hie middle of Jeckyl Island
about ati hour alter sunset, on a spar.
The last he saw of the wreck it was bottom
up, and the Captain, Mate and two
. black seamen, were on her bottom, and
| two other men in the boat, which was
full of water. Soon after the boat passed
by him with nobody in it. There was a
schooner in sight when she upset, and run
down upon her,'but as he believes saved
none sf the crew. They were like himself,
floating about, that is those not already
drowned. It was too rough to
keep a boat on the top of the waves, lie
remained on Jekyl Island all night, not
knowing that the Island was inhabited,
and seeing the Light Iloose, he came to
the nor'h end <?f it, and finding a plank,
launched himself upon the sound, and
, with a paddle he found on the bank, padI
clled himself across, taking the last of
I the flood tide, and landed near Mr. King's,
i Several fragments of the wreck has
come ashore along the heach, together
with the foremast, broke below the cap.
The srhooner was in ballast, two days
from St. Augustine, and commanded by
Capt. Flyman. The poor fellow came
ashore naked, having torn his clothes ofT
while afloat that the surges might not
I have so much hold of him and thinks
I that is what saved him. T. B.King, Esq. |
and ms overseer, ivir. Keddtng, clothed
him and treated him with great kindness.
John goijlp.
ifce learn that one of the passengers
wars a clergyman from Charleston.
The crops have suffered much by the
late gale; that, u'ith the severe drought
will make our crops short.
Effects of the Gale.?The blow
which we noticed yesterday as having]
commenced on Thursday* increased in |
1 violence down to between 9 and 10 o'clock i
last night, and continued, with some in-1
' termission, until ahout 6 or 7 o'clock this
i morning, when it abated, the wind being
r fortunately from N. E. to N*. and by W.
i during its height. The damage to the
. Wharves and shipping is inconsiderable.'
Several trees were uprooted and slates I
dislogcd from the houses, hut we have
r heard of no other injury! We are apprehensive
that the crops on the sea hoard
have suffered considerably. The followr
ing is as accurate an account as we could
' obtain of the damage sustained by the
shipping.
1 The brig Arethnsa, lying at the New
e York Steam packet Company's wharf, had
i her larboard considerably Injured by chas
fing against the wharf. The steam pack.
et New York, also at tame, had her rail
and a small portion *f<her bulwarks, far*
ward, torn away Ift&er fasts. The sebr.
Mobile, at Hulmtia Go's wharf, had her
stem much injured and unshipped her
bowsplitv , A number of etnall crates Were
sunk at Fitzsimon'a wharf. The steam
packet Win. beabrook, lying at Fitzaim-!
onvs North wharf, had her guards on the
larboard side started up, and is otherwise
considerably injured. The 6r. barque
Mary, lying atFraser's wbf. had her starboard
side very much chafed; lost ^ her
bumpkin, david, fashion piece and her jolly
boat stove. The Dr. ekip Frances, lying
at the same wh? parted her fasts; and
carried away the mast of the Bloob Rice
Plant, which \VaS lying along aide of her ;
the F. was brought up by the stream anchor,
after driving aloulof the New Pier
head, being built by the lessees of Prices*
wharf?she started the head from the
moorings and then drove into the stream,
where she rode out the gale without material
injury. The ship Belvidere, at
Boyce and & Go's wharf, had her* side
very much chafed. The schr. Lagrange j
at Edmondstnn's wharf, had the Bulwarks
on her larboard bow stove.?Char. Pat.

Extract of a letter dated
VEf.Asco, Texas, A tip. 6, 1837.
Since my last, I have been to the seat
of Government, Houston. All things:
seem to go on very well. There are up
wards of one thousand citizens and many .
transient persons in this city, Houston.
General Houston, the President has returned
and is in fine health and spirits;?
He has effected a treaty with the Indians,
which has not as yet been published?so
soon as it is, I will send you one. The
President was met on his return to the
scat of government by n goodly concourse
of citizens artd officers and escorted to his
residence by them. A large public dinner
was ffiven to him in San Auirustine. the
0 y
strong hold of his opponents, where he
addressed them, explaining to them the
different acts lie has vetoed, and the reasons
which actuated him. Those who
heard his speech en this occasion, speak
of it as one of his most finished efforts?
the effect has been great, as the next
election will slievif. The opposition against
him has in a great measure decreased, for
where light is, darkness disappears.
The Honorable W. S. Fisher, Secretary
of War, has resigned; Col. B. B. Bee
is spoken of to 611 his situation.
The notorious Thompson, _ arrested
lately by Major J. W. Scott and Captain
P. W. Humphrey has been examined and
released. I expect he will be Commissioned
as a privateer captain. He will
be of great service to us, 1 make no doubt.
The army is still at Texana under the
command of Col.- Morehouse. They arc
in good health and subordinate.
Dr. Lynch, Surgeon of this port, Velasco,
was killed in a duel with Lieut. W.
Redficld, a few days back. Rcdfield is in
the hands of the civil authority. No one
however blames him for his having so
done. The post is in command of Lieut.
R. G. Saunders, and nil things go on
smoothly.
Col, Wharton left here a few days since
for Matamoras, in an American armed
vessel fof Matamoras, carrying thirty
prisoners for the purpose of eifecting an
exchange. Whether the Flag of Truce
will protect her, remains to be seen. He
is empowered to give his thirty for one,
and in the same rate, for all of our prisoners
in their possession.
The Brutus and Invincible have not
been heard of?the Secretary of the Navy
is in one of them. They are thirty
dnys over sailing order.
The Drig Bclvide e parted her cable
and ran ashore yesterday. All here suppose
it to have been done on purpose, and
of which 1 have no doubt.
Deaf Smith has left for the West and
goes into the Mexican domain ere he returns.
I think in the absence of something
definite from Mexico the next e/?r?_
press will order a call for the army on
furlough and invade Mexico. Ten thou*
sand men can be raised for that purpose in
thirty days here in Te*as, and I suppose
half that number in the States. The hostile
Indians have' retreated before our
men, who are prosecuting the war with
vigor, into their remotest villages, where
they will either have to give in or light.
Houston intends issuing his ploclamation
oginst duelling shortly. The corn
crop is tremendous and cotton very fine.
All other crops accordingly.

< oiTort.?Tne past has been a very dull week
in the Upland Cotton market, owing to the inclemency
of the weather, and the almost total ab1

one cent on the middling and good qualities, and
' about halt a cent on prime Upland. The operations,
however, have been so extremely limited,
that we do not th'nk the sale's of the week a fair

thai is done in Congress?sketches of the attendant
discussions, with an Appendix contaiaing the
finished speeches prepared by the members themselves?they
are suited not only to gratify the
curiosity of the hour, to inform the distant c mstituency
of the part performed by their immediate
representatives, and of the result of the labors ot
all; but, we donbt not, they will be found permanently
useful as the most authentic, complete, and
convenient parliamentary record of our times.
This undertaking h ving, with these views, been
liberally patronized by the public, it is onr purpose
to justify this early and continued favor by increasing
the strength of our corps of Reporters at
the next fall and winter Sessions. The Fall session
will be looked to bv the country to settle all
that has been unsettled by the overthrow of the
I system of Depositee ?s established by Congress?
the overthrow of the currency as established by
the Constitution?and the overthrow of the system
of revenue, both na a means of adequate supply
for present demands, th* maintainance of matinfictures,
and the regulation of commerce. Every
thing of pecuniary interest to the Government
and the nati-m will be involved in the discussions
ef the next Congress; and it was because the President
would not have those all important subjects
left to Executive discretion a moment beyond the
time ..when a full Congress could be summoned,'
that the September session was convoked. The
machinery of government, even when thrown out
of g^er, must continue to work ; but when so dis- .
ordered, its movement may be driven in a wrong
direction. The Representatives of the people are
alone competent to set all tri rights. No Demo-,
cratic Chief Magistrate would continue, in the
condition of things at present existing, to substii
tute Executive expedients for clearly defined law
i springing from the public will.
