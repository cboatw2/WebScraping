circulation of small notes, which was valuable
to tin* bank, and substituting the precious
metals in their place.
It is my intention to exert myself to have J
a substitute at the present session lor the I
law of the last session, free of objections ;'
also to obtain a repeal of that part of the
latter requiring the payment of interest by
the deposite banks, both re.respectively and
prospectively.
It will aid me much if the directors of the
various banks to whom I send this will address
letters to such members of each House
as tliev may be acquainted with, impressing
upon them the onerous duties which have
been performed by the deposite banks, the
injustice done many of them by the exaction
of interest as the law is now construed, and
the magnanimity which Congress would
display by a lotal relinquishment of interest
altogether, both pa>t and for the future.
Another argument might he employed,
bur it would l>e impolitic to make use of i4
with members, which is this: that us soon
as the sum in the Treasury comes to be reduced
by the operation of the deposite law.
the banks winch will be continued will hardly
find it an object to subject themselves to
tue expense ot acting as fiscal agents, for
the use of the small sum which each can
have, oven without paying any interest
whatever. Before the close of next year,
we must go back to as small a number of
deposite banks as were employed prior to
the passage of the deposite act; consequently,
with but few exceptions, the newly sobanks
will have to become as they were.
All tiiis pan of the subject bad better be
promulgated here ; it is my intention speedily
to counnence upon that subject, first, by
enlightening Cougrcss in rclatien to tlie facts,
of which 1 am sure most of the members
are ignorant, and then to proceed to carry
through my object; and I hojie I may receive
ail the support possible from those
immediately interested in the way I have
pointed out.
I shall send this communication to veryfew
of the hanks not of the original selection,
and 1 trust that all to whom 1 do send it will
view it as one not to be made public, thougli
nut marked confidential.

lost in adopting such measures us may be
considered expedient.
I would add one further suggestion?
that, in all casiis where letters may be written
upon this subject, a willingness be expressed
to aid in future to the full ex'ont of
lfte ability of the bank, as fur as circum.
stances will permit, the carrying out of the
measure of substituting a metallic tor a pa.

that the Secretary of the Senate, at such time
as the Senate may appoint, shall bring the
manuscript journal ofthe session ofl833-'34 into

So the resolution was agreed to.
Mr. Benton, observing that nothing now remained
bfct for the Secretary to carry into effect
the order of the Senate^ moved that that

The Secretary thereupon produced the record
of the Senate, and opening it at the page
which contained the resolution to be expunged
did in the presence of such of the members of
the Senate as remained, (many having retired,)
proceed to draw black lines entirely round
the resolution, and to endorse across the lines
the words 44Expunged by order of the Senate,
[he 16f/i day of January 1837."
No sooner had this been done, than hisses,
loud and repeated, were heard from various
parts of the gallery.
The Chair, (Mr. King, of Alabama.) Clear
the galleries.
Mr. Benton hoped that innocent persons
would not be excluded from the gallery. Let
the ruffians alone be apprehended, who made
the disturbance. Let the Sergeant at arms
sieze the ruffians. Let him apprehend the
bank ruffians, lie hoped they would not be
permitted to disturb the Senate as they did
when this body was under the power of the
(J. S. Bank, and armed ruffians insulted us
with impunity. Here is one?the Bank ruf[ians.
The order to clear was revoked and the
sergeant at arms ordered to apprehend the offenders.
He brought down one, a tall well
dressed man. Mr. Benton moved that he be
brought to the Bar.
He was brought to the bar accordingly, and
Mr. Benton?remarking that lie was sufficiently
punished by the public arrest?moved to
lischarge him. After various motions and
10 small confusion the motion to discharge
prevailed, with only one dissenting voice.
Upon this, he stepped towards the Chair, and
said, w Mr. President, am I not permitted to
speak in my own defence
Ciivir, (to the sergeant at arms,) "Take
lim out." Thus ended the Senatorial farce.

' for the old States an equal share in the public

Mr. Lane who was entitled to the floor, proj
ceeded to address the House at length in op(position
to the resolution. He denied the
truth of the assumption that the lands were
ceded as a donation; and contended that they
were grants made upon contract, and for
which, not a nominal, but a full, fair, and bona
/^consideration had been paid by the States,
by the surrender of the right of taxing the pub|
lie domain, and by the construction of works
i of improvement, which had enhanced, to a vast

No subject has given rise to so animated and
I ihln aion in thn T.norislatiire of North
Carolina during the present' session, as the
| bill to grant banking privileges to the corporai
tion for constructing this great work.
| The bill, after having been first rejected in
i the Senate, was again re-considered and passj
ed by a mijority of three votC3. After a de|
bate of several days in the House of Commons f
it also passed that body with some amendments
by the same majority. When returned
to tli? Senate for concurrence in the amend,
inents, they were all concurred in, two of them
by the casting vote of the Speaker. But another
amendment was added, the fate of which in
the Commons we have not yet learnt. It precludes
foreigners from holding stock, and it
i was feared by some would at last defeat the
| bill. Col. Memminger, the commissioner from
I this State, addressed both Houses, on the snbi
ject, and with an effect perhaps rarely, if ever,
produced upon such a body by any public speaker.
When CoL Memminger reached Raleigh,
almost the whole Legislature was opposed to
the project of gran* in? bmking privileges to t!:c
company; but such was the change effected by
tiic power of his eloquence and reasoning that
the bill passed both Houses. The in^antiM*
! however areso em ill that we are still apprehensive,
it may possibly fail upon an incidental
question on some of the amendment prapseed.
A most unreasonable jealousy of the omMK
was entertained by some, from the strange
suspicion that it was a disunion project of the
Nullification party of this State. It m difficult
to believe that sensible, well informed men can
be sincere in the utterance of such a suspicion.
A bill has passed the Hooae of Commons of
North Carolina to incorporate the Kiileifh and
Columbia Rail Road, to ran above Fayette ville,
through Richmond county, and probably
through this place. Capitalists would beyond
doubt find the construction of such a Rail Road
if it continued to Augusta a most profitable investment
of funds.
It was not certain at the date of our last
accounts from Raleigh, what disposal the Le

R. M. Whitney, from whose circular to the*
depo'ite banks an extract wiBbe found in an*
other column, is the sunewfte deliberately
committed perjury before a committee of the
House of Representatives a few years since:
The committee had been sent by dm House
to Philadelphia, to investigatethe afinsef the
U. S. Bank; and having summoned Nr. Whit*
ney, who was clerk or some other agent in the
Bank, before them as a witness, he tcstifcid,
en oath, that, an a specified day, Mr. Riddle*
President of the Bank, in his presence, gave
directions (the nature of which we do not now
recollect) in relation to the afhfri of the Bank,
j And to impress it the mote strongly on the
committee and Congress and the public that
t here could possibly be no mistake* be farther
testified that he immediately committed to
! writing both the direqjSons and the date. It
afterwards appeared Bohr ever, on the most indubitable
evidence, that Mr. Biddle was in
Washington City at the very time when Whitney
swore that he was in Philadelphia giving
these directions in relation to the afikirs of the
Bank.
Now whether Mr. Biddle did really give the
directions testified or not, it is moat manifest
that Whitney, in order to strengthen his testimony
to that effect, did deliberately swear to
what be at the time knew to be an ontrutk..
He might, at some subsequent time, have made
i an entry on his journal, or note book, of what
was really a fact, and entered what be then,
supposed to be the date of its occurrence; but'
he could not have made the entry immediately,
nor could he afterwards believe that he did;
unless, indeed, he is so destitute of the power
r\( rornll^rhnil So >hn0nthflr to fifltHlKfr him
for being a witness of put occurrences; which
no one pretends to be the case; and which be
himself would be the last to admit. It exhibits
a wretched state of public morals whea the
Government patronizes such a man, or institutions
which give him employment:
