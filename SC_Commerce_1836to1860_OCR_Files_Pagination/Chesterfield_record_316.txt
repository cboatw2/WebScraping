Singular Accident and Miraculous EsI
caps.?().w of the most sitignl ?r acri lenfs,
icc mp iiiit ii by a most miraculous < s**a
we li.?v?* ever hid occasion <> record,
occurred yesterday in Poriland Place. Mr.
Holland, a resident i!i?tp, 0:1 returning
home from ii s morning's work o dm nor.
took into Ins arms Ins hide chilil?i g ri
abou two \pars''old?and was walkng wim
i; {>!v. tn'iy about :he hous\ when, finding
the scuttle 111 tho attic open, h' .'wended
the stairs o look out. While he w s stand
ing on il?e steps, a favori o kitten of tbe
chill's 2urn by teem, and pissed on to the
roof.
The child exhibiting a wish to catch the
kitten, trie father, thoughtlessly p'acod her
(the child) on the ri 'go pole of .lie house, j
(a brick house, threo stori -s high.) whde he
wut on the roof to ca'ch young pussy. H
had It fi the child but a morrvn , when it lost
its balance, ro'led over, and sliding from tin?

the spectators o! litis awful scene, 'h(! o'lild
was taken up, t.ot only nlivo but without the

FRIDAY EVENING, NOVEMBER 22, 1839. I
We understand that Mr. Mills the State j
Engine ;r, lately made to examinati >n of the
Fee Dee from this place down as far as the contract
of Messrs. Gregg and Marsha 1 for clear- i
ing it out, under the appropriation of 1837, j
extended; and finding the work faithfully
executed according to contract, received it.
At the worst shoals, those near the mouth of
Thompson's Creek, we learn that the water
is now at least six inches deeper than at eorao
of the othert lower down. From all we have
been able to learn, we have no doubt that the
work has been faithfully done, and, unlike too
much of the works paid for from the pub ic
treasury, at a moderate price. ' As much has
been accomplished as could be, with the
amount appropriated. But the amount was
much less than the fair proportion of the Pee
Dee country from the appropriations made
for work* of internal improv ment in the s'ate.
H ad it been larger, however,:t is not improbable
that less work would have been done, and less
benefit been derived in proportion to the
amount expended. The Pee Dee country has
Juet claims for further appropriations from the
Legislature, which we hope it will pre=s at a
future and not distant day ; and which, if 'airly
presented at a proper time, will doubtless*
be candid'y considered.
The state election in New York has resulted
in favor of the Whigs, but by a few thousand
voted h ** than last year. The change
was most y in the city. The majority on join >
ballot of the two houses is put down a I'd to I
20. Mr. Tallrnadge will therefore be re-e!ec
| ted t? the U. S. Senate.
Massacuusbtts.?The state election took
! place in th s state la?t week ; full returns
have not yet reached us, but from those received,
?t appears that if Mortojj, the administration
candidate far Governor has not been
elected over Governor Everett, he has conae
very near it. From all wo can team however
the election seemed to turn upon o'her questions
than national politics. Gov. Everett
was open y committed in favor of the "fifteen
gallon law" or the law wh en proniuus imp
sale of anient spirits in less quantities than 15
gallons. All topers and a large proportion of
lempernte drinkers too, of course, opposed his
election; and this question produced more
excrement in many if not moat parts of the
state than any other. Gov. Everett was also
obnoxious to the abolitionists who are numerous
in lhe state; and the most of them are eaul to
| have voted for Morton. Thes?* men, however,
being once associated with the Ad:n iiisiration
party in a warm contest may possibly continue
to act with them in future elections. Abbot
Lawrence is elected to Congre-s from ths
Boston district in the place of Mr. Fletcher
resigned, and Mr. Baker, to supply a vacancy
in another district, caused by the death of Mr.
Alvord. The two members elect are Whigs,
as were also their predecessors.
Mississippi Election.?The State Election
took pi,ice in Mississippi early in the present
month. Wc have aron accounts from only
eight counties; in these the Whigs have Ion*
7 members and gained 2, compared with the
last election ; making a clear loss of o. At
this ra e the Administration party are likely
to hive the majority in the State.
It will be seen .?y a semi-official article co- j]
pied into a precedit g column, frotn 'lie Army I
and Navy Chronicle, that the Government
have determined, for the present at least, to
discontinue offensive operations agiinst the
Sun nolcs, and to act inucly on the defensive.

An "Association for the promotion of the
cul'ure of Silk in the United States" has recently
been formed in Philadelphia, of which
Mr. Biddle, late President of the U. S. Bank

field of .\IuIticauli8|growmg on ins iarm near

Roberts' Silk Manual.?It will be seen
by an advertisement in our columns that this
excellent little work is for sale at the Bookstore.
Of all the manual? to which the present
excitement on the subject of silk has given
rise, this is the cheapest arid decidedly the
best. A person of common discernment and
common dexterity, with this manual in his
hand, may raise g:lk successfully and profitably,
without having ever seen a silk worm in
the possession of any one else. The Legislature
of Pennsylvania, a year or two since
bought a large number ?f copies to be dis'ributcd

CHER AW ADVERTISER. ^
The Editor of the Cheraw Gazette hae de- &
rtnined, at the suggestion of the Pee Dee *
kg-iculiural Society, to devote more space
nan formerly to Agriculture, and matters per- i
lining specially to its interests. About cine jkJ
olumns, or a page and a half weekly, will be Igt
rru;ned with this subject, except when it fj?
rial! be necessary to make room for Executive \
lessages, and a few other political papefs ^
jch as every intelligent citizen ought to read. ^
, large proportion of what shall appear under '
ie Agricultural head must, of course, be ee- ]
ct?'d. But the numerous Agricultural peri- ?
iicals now published in this country afford j
bundant and excellent materials for selection; 4$
nd, after a short t;me, the reportP, and other
spc-r* of the Pee Dee Agricultural Society jB
ill of themselves, form no inconeiderab!? ri
ndy of original matter, all of it adapted parouiarly
to this part of the country. And it
hoped, also, that among the numerous indligent
and enterprising plante e cf the survjnding
districts and counties some may be
>und who will, occasionally, take the trouble
f / r>ntrihnt?n<T tri thr? rr^i-mnn rf the naner the
esult of thoir experience.
^ Among the subjects which will engage tlio
Editor's attention the culture of silk shall not
e overlooked. Ample instructions will be
'Wen, in their proper season, for cultivating
he morus mulicaulis and making eilk.
The paper will espouse the cause of no party
ri politics, but shall contain an impartial sum
nary of political intelligence, and, occasionally,
ible speeches and well written essays (when
net with) fairly discussing the principles and
neasures of all parties. It is believed that a
:omp;iratively small space devoted to political <
?ubjects in this way may be made more profitaole
to the Farmer of domeptic habits, who wish- f J
?y to be acquainted with the true 6tate of the
country and qualified for a proper and inteili- v
E[ont discharge of the duties of citizenship, than
a whole sheet filled, from week to week, and j
year to year, wiih one-6ided discussions, and ?fl|
he mere quarrels of editors and politicians,?
whilst, at the same time, it will not be calculated
to estrange neighbor from neighbor, or
to mislead into a belief that ono half of tho
country are less patriotic than the other, or
Iosp ardently attached to our republican institutions.
So much of the fourth page as shall not be 1
occupied with standing advertisements will
generally be filled up with matter of moral and
religious cast, and articles conducive, in other J
respects, to proper family insfc action and family Jl
discipline. h
It the increase to the subscription list upon ^
issuing this Prospectus shall be sufficient to al
warrant tho expense, new type will be pro. j
cured, forthwith, for the body of the paper; '' **(!
that is for the part now printed in large tetter; J
and at the commencement of the next volume 1
the title of the paper will be charged to iyj
Farriers1 Gazette end Cher a u Advertiser.
