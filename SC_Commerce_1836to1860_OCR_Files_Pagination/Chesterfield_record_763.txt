ABON BVRR AND BLANNKBUASSKT.
During the last session of Congress the
widow of Harmon Blannerhassett petition.
?d for indemnity for losses incurred hy her
lato husband, in consequence of the des.
truction of his property by an armed forco,
during the excitement growing out of
Burr'a conspiracy, while the petition was
under consideration, the unfortunato lady
died at New York, at the ago of 70. She
was very poor; having been for many
years supported by a warm-hearted coun.
tryman. Her extraordinary beauty and
accomplishments havo been rendered fa.
mous by Mr. Wirt's eloquent description,
in his defence of her husband. He repro.
sented her as " beautiful as a llouri, and
gifted as Zobcide."
Iter husbund, a wealthy Iriah emigrant,
shared the political opinions of Robert
Emmet, and is said to have left Ireland to
avoid his fate. Ho bought nn estate on
Bacchus Island, in the broad Ohio, on
which he expended $55,000. It became
renouned for the elegance of the mansion,
the tasteful arrangement of the grounds,
and the loveliness of the scenery. It was
described as a luxurious retreat, which
"Calypso and her Nymphs might have
erfried."
Not even the ruins of this once famous
place are now remaining. In an evil hour,
one fine spring morning, Aaron Burr landed
on that beautiful Island, and sent his
servant with tho following note:
" Colonel Burr solicits the favor of being
permitted to tcatultxLgmong the grounds
of Mrs. BlannerhafflStf
This, of course, received a courteous
answer, and tho acquaintance thus begun
involved the hoepitablo emigrant in the
treasonable designs of his insidious guest.
A military force took possession of the
island, burnt tho splendid house and furniture.
destroyed tho beautiful gardens,
and drove the once happy family into
exile.
The following account, from the Licking
Valley Register, Kentucky, is given
by one who knew them in their prosperity :
Much has been said and written on the
conspiracy of Aaron Burr ; and a diversity
of oninion still exists, as to thn M?pni
of hia designs. The elegant retirement
of Blannerhasset, previous to his association
with Burr, has also been a theme ol
eloquence and a subject of admiration.
As I lived near the centro of Buir's operations,
and was intimato with the family
of Blannerhassett, many facts came under
my observation which perhaps are not
generally known. I therefore comply
with your request by detailing circumstances
which were familiar to me at that po.
riod.
With reference to Burr's conspiracy, 1
have never doubted the fact, that his first
object wast separation of tho States, and
the establishment of "an energetic government,"
including our north west and
southwestern territories. This intention
was clearly manifested by a series of publications
with the signature of "Qubr1st,"
in the " Ohio Gazette," a paper then
printed at Marietta, by one Fairlamb.
Those numbers held forth all tho arguments
that could be urged, to induce the
withdrawal of the West and South from
the old States. Burr furnished the leadins
ooints. Blnnnerha&aett wrntn tknm mil
and attended to tlioir publication. The
first number was read to tho printer, by
Blannerhassett, at my father's house, and
in the presence of several of the family.
After the printer had retired my father
made a strong appeal to Mr. Blanncrhasaett,
on the folly and danger of such an
enterprise; reminding him of his narrow
escapo from the troubles of Ireland, of the
unhappy form of government he then enjoyed,
and of his delightful situation at
the Island, surrounded with all the sources
of earthly bliss. Mr. Blanncrhassett was
disconcerted ; he acknowledged his obligations
for my father's friendly motives,
but attributed their different views to difference
of age. My father indignantly
replied that ho had fought for the Govern
i l- i?, -j -i - <
iiiciii uiiuci BIO llVOIJf inoi 116 lovoci
it os the apple of his eye, and that treason
against it could not bo concerned under
hia roof. Mr. Blannerhnssett politely
withdrew, took up hia quarters at a public
house, and never made his home with
us afterwards. But number after number
of the "Qubrist," came before the propie,
holding forth the possession of the
public innds, with all their mineral productions?the
great agricultural prospects
of the West-?the vast navigable waters
?the occupation of New Orloans as a
commercial emporium, and various other
arguments in favor of a separate government.
A day was also appointed to hold
a convention at the island.
But the plans of Burr were not confined
to tho separation of the States; he
knew that this project might fail, and the
establishment of an empire in tho Mexican
country was his alternative, n number
of batteaux, or row-gallios, were prepared
on the Muskingum river, and prohubly
seme at other points, with which
he intended a rapid descent on New Orleans,
or to ascend the Red river towards
Mexico, aa circumstances might require.
Numbers of restless and despurnte spirits
wero enlisted in his visionary schemes,
1 "
ivim ? iii?uurg in now urioans but (lie
maws of the westorn people were attached
to their government, nnd their connec*
lions cant of the mountains. If the convention
had assembled at the island, the
Inhabitants of the neighbourhood were
prepared to disperse them with force and
arms. The convention failed ; and when
a party attempted to escape with tho boats
they were prevented by the mililin, under
a special law of Ohio, passed for theocca<
sion, with closed doors. Hut there were
traitor* in Ihat legislature?in Congress
?and in the army of the United States. ,
mmmmmmmmmmmammammmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmoi
Burr mot in council with n fragment of
his followers, on an island in tho Missis*
sippi, whore his scheme was abandoned.
He fled in disguise but was arrested, tried
at the city of Richmond, and acquitted by
a quirk of the law. Blanncrhassott and
other associates wcro discharged. His
family, sorvants and furniture, having do*
scended the river to Natchez, ho located
himself on a cotton farm in that vicinity.
The ombargo and the war which follow,
cd, defeated his expectations; he bccamo
embarrassed; his fortune having been
unpaired by his liabilities for Burr. Un.
dor the prospect of a civil appointment in
Lower Canada, ho removed to Montreal,
but his friend, tho governor, being removed,
he was again disappointed, and retired
at last to tho Island of Jersey, in the British
channel, where his maiden sister resided,
a lady of fortune. There he died the
victim of a romantic and visionary mind.
Blanncrhassott was an Irish nobleman,
a man of science, and a polished gentloman.
He excelled in the composition
and porformanco of music; his instruments
were tho violin, and bass-viol, both
of which ho used in tho manner of tho
onus, ins spacious nnll was constructed
in musical proportions, where the tones of
his viol vibrated with thrilling effect. His
library was elegant and extensive, his laboratory
was provided with abundant apparatus
for chemical and philosophical experiments,
and his houso and gardens
were furnished with various means of winter
and summer amusements. Tho mansion,
with its corridor and wings, formed
half an ellipsis, and the finish and furniture
of its apartments were adapted to the
uso for which they were intended. The
hall was a spacious, lofty room, its walls
painted a sombro color, and its furniture
rich, heavy, and grand. The drawing
room wa9 in perfect contrast, and its doc.
orations light as a Tory's wing. In short
tho whole establishment was noble and
genteel, without the glare of tinsel finery,
or the inconsistency of bad taste. His
stylo of living was in unision with his
house and furniture, always elegant, easy
and comfortable. The arrangements of
the grounds was equally complete, the
famous shrubcry was a mimic wilderness,
with labyrinth walks bordered with flow,
i ers, and interspersed with arbors and
. grottos. The extensive pnsturcs in front,
t with itR flocks and herds, was separated
from the lawn by an invinciblo fenco;
and the view upon tho Ohio was obstruc[*
ted for several miles. But the whole
, scene requires the pen of a poet. The
. description of Wirt is nearer the reality
than is generally believed, and his sketch
. of Mrs. Blannerhassett is equally truo to
nature. She was n beautiful, and nccom'
plished lady, of dignified appearance and
. manners; a (Table, friendly, and without
the least affectation, yet with all her clegancc,
she was a noble housewife, and dovoted
to her ncedlo; not in the produc;
tion of flowers and flounces, but of garI
ments for her children and servants.
The miserable slanders which have been
reported of her, arc without the least
foundation. Burr did not seduce Blannerhassett,
through the medium of his
wifo, as has often been stated ; his only
visit to the island did not exceed three
days; and no woman of Mrs. Blnnnerhassett's
mind and character, could be corrupted
on so brief an acquaintance. Blannerhassett
was an open and unguarded
man, easily imposed upon nnd enthusiastic
in all his impulses. Burr approached
him in the most artful and insidious manner.
Descending the river in a batteaux.
ho landed as a passing stranger merely to
see and admire the far-famed island. Mr.
Blanncrhassett hearing that a stranger
was on his lawn sent n servant to invite
him to the house; tho wily serpent sont
his card with an apology, but Mr Blanner*
hassett with his usual hospitality walked 1
out and insisted on his remaining a day
or two. Burr very modestly acquiesced,
and during that unfortunato interview,!
i infused tho poison of ambition into the
unwary mind of his visionary host. Mrs.
Blnnnerhassett endeavoured to dissuade
her husband Irom the enterprise, but findhis
soul enlisted in it, her sense of duty
compelled her to acquiesce in his views,
which resulted in the ruin of his family.
Years havo gone by, and the talo at last,
Is told as a sorrowful sccno long past."
The steamboat pnsscngcr looks on the
deserted islnnd for some vestnge of its for.
mer embclishinent; but he looks in vnin.
The mansion was destroyed by fire, its
beautiful appendages are obliterated, its
hospitality, tho soul of music and the re.
finement of tnsto and intellect have all do.

many happy hours, tho only memento of

THE ACADEMY BUILDINGS.
THE Cheraw Academical Society is now in
debt about $1600. Since its establishment it
has expended, for lots, buildings, and repairs,
about $5000; besides large sums of money in
making up to teachers from time to time deficiencies
in their salaries, arising from inadequate
receipts for tuition. Though the
Society has heretofore received considerable
aid froin citizens and others not members ; yet
the principal burden and the whole responsi.
bility (previous to last year) has always rested
on those who were. The Society now
consists of few in number ; and at a meeting
convened this day, it was resolved to sell the
Academical Lots and Buildings for the purpose
of paying the above debt; unless some
measures are promptly adopted by the community
to discharge the same. Most, perhaps
all, the members of the Society are understood
to be willing to co-opcratc with their fellow
citizens in this matter; but they are not disposed
to do it without their assistance..
The 16th day of next month is fixed for
delerrning upon tho sale ; unless, before that
date, the peoplo (with such arguments as satisfy
creditors) put their veto upon it.
