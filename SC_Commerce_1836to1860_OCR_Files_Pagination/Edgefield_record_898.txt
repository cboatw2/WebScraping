ENCE OF oULa COTTON CROi.
In currontilue, Carton may be alt ay
estinmated as we would gold. It is not a
article of doubtful importance and neve
returds for want of a market. The peac
of Europe and the tranquility of Englan
depend upon the 'United States Cottoi
Crop. A war or any other calamity tha
would interrupt the transit of Cotton fron
the United States, would stop the Fac
iories of England, deprive millions a
employment and lead to the terrible scene
bc internal discord, rapine, and plunder
throunghbot the British Isles. Our Cottoi
Ctop s iberefore a great national pacifica
for and a great negotiator. All the diplo
matists in the world cannot equal it. It ha
placed Englaid at our reet. The peopl
of our Southern States rely tipon it for do
mestic support, and the mechanics ani
sailors of the North mainly depend upon i
for employment. The Northern Farme
and the Manufacturer are also deeply in
terested in retaining a nalidtial monopol]
of the Cotton markets of the world.
Britain being painfully agitated at Ihe hu
miliating position of which our Cotton mo
nopoly has placed her, rendering it utter)
impossible for her to bully or brow beat u
as she does the rest of the world. is em
ploying every means to stimulate the cul
ture of Cotton in other countries. Heice
her movements in Texas, Mexico and Cal
ifornia. Her great scheine which we
exposed early last mouth. was the mosi
jestistical of any thing yet attempted ; we
allude to the cry of "over production al
Cotton in America," first raised by the
London Times and other leading Englii
papers, and re-echoed by a notorious prin
in this city conducted .by a British subject
We promptly exposed the schette, and we
are gratifying to know that our exposure
has placed lte people. of the South upoc
their guard as to the insidious dangers 0a
our great commercial rival on the othet
side of the Atlantic. Our Planters noti
see that it is to their interest to produce
cheaper than any others, and thus dofeal

Agricultural Improvement in Virginia
Maryland, Carolina 4;c.,
Fellow- Citiens :-In unison with the
views of sundry Southern gentlemen-who
are warmly interested in agricultural im
provement, an(t in accordance with the in
quiries of various friends in the Northern
States, the undersigned are collecting sia
tisticts illustrative of the vast field for en
terprise presented by the uticultivated lands
of the South. The dilapidated estates, as
well as the virgin soil, in various sections
of the Old Sduthern States, present attrac
tions %% hich would tot long be slighted,
were the facts generally known. rhous
ands of enterprising emigranits from the
Northern Siates would annually select
Virginia in preference to the Vestern coun
iry, were her advantages preiented ~in a
manner calculated to arrest theirattention.
At present, all the Guide Books for settle
ment point exclusively to the West; while
examination- and ,reflection will probably
satisry any iutelligent man that the world
nowhere pres'ents a better field forenlight
ened enterprise -than is furnished by the
millions of acres which now invite im
provement in the high-land regions as well
as in the tide-water section of the "Old
Dominion." o u
The natural advantagesofVriaae

world. The richnmess' of the soil ini large

as they arc sometimes styled, abound gen

wherever mismanagement hats robbed it
of qualities essential to successful fairmting
The land abounds not only with these
manures, but with mitneral mtantrs of in
culculable value. The mountains em

tity any pussible requirements of' the lar

fisheries isi largely experienced, not merely
in the tide water region, but to a great. ex
tetnt through the interior, and what territo
ry ay where surpasses the Virginia moun
tains in qttalificntions for sheep husband

tions and equally important with-any o
them, is the mnildtess of the climate-ati

settlers, who, when abandoning their home
in the North, would prefer the Sutherm
temperature if it could be enjoyed unde
advantages like those presented by th
Western States now moost rapidly accu
mulating.immigranj population.
The men of Virginia, familiar with th
* career of. Washington, neect not be to
that, with such extraordinary combinatic
of advantages, the "Old Dominion" wot
not now be razeed in the scale of State
of the spirit which inAuenced that illustrio
