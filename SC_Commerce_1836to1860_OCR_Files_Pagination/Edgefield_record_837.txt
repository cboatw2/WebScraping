M1r. BURT addressed the louse substan
tially as followe
Before:1 proceed, Mr. Speaker, to pre
sent such views of the topics which have
been introduced into this debate as i may
be able to compress into the brief space
allotted ine by your rules, I feel cou
strained to totice a remark of the honor
able. gentleman tm New York, (Mr.
Beardttey.) Whean that gentleman ad
dressed the House ont the question now
under consideration, lie thought fit to say
-not, to be sure, as the -announcement of
a fact, but' as the expression of a confideot
opiion-"He took it for granted, that, in
regard to slavery in the abstratt; there ex
isted at the North and at the West and at
the South, but one sentihtant ;" and very
intelligibly intimated that, in all 'the'e se
tions of the Confederacy; it is admitted to
be a great evil; he, idweer;liid the con
siderateness- perhaps the charity-to ac
quit the present generation orthe "Iiiil't,"
as he was pleased to say, of ihat institu
tion.
Now, sir I do not pretend to know the
relation, which th~at gentleman bears to
parties at, the.North,.nor do I choose to
inquire the meotis n-hich he possesses ol'
ascertaining Northern "sentiment"- or
Westerta "sentiim'est" on the subject of
slavery. I feel, I assure you, sirt.as little
.concern whtethel- diat "sentiiat" be fa
- vokable or adverse f6 jst institution. But
T.will not permitmtyself readily to believe,
- (whatever opinion on this..subject they may
s.taertain,) .that the .people of any consid
,erable portionf of thius country are utterly
afithIke a n' reereanit to the high and sa

not deem it presumptuous in a represera

full and accurate knowledge of the epin
ions and sentimenits which prevail at the
South concerning a merely Southern in
stitution, s5 he can enjoy,-and at least
-eqjnal. authority to declare them in this
BlofRdepresentative. Sir, whatever
mnay'bEthe opinions of mankind, elsewhere
sofa'iCthe remarks of the gentleman
from New Ybrk was intended to apply to
the-State in whieb 4- tesi-de, and of which
I have the honor to be-agrepresentative, I
take reav- to declare tou him and to the.
world, on my own resisibility, tomy'
constituents, to whom I appeat for the.
truth of the declaration, that ie never ut
tered or entertaimed an opinion-"more ab-.
solutely destitute of all foundation. Sir,
I. have yet to learn that public opinion in.
South Carolina, at any period of its hier
toryhas~even questioned-the moiality' of
the expediency of that instil'utioi4. Eni
Stehtaining theiopinions which .were fliel'd
by their ancestorsvghe. present generation:

rhe importation of native Africans ihti
the colonies of North America, to be hel
in slave'ry the most unqualified and abso
lute, was tpproved no tess 'by the minis
try and sovereign of Great Britain that
the inhabitants of the colonies tbemsellres
The sIgloniea -of the east,lt' lieuld be ad
mittedere the earliest to declare thei
disaprobafion'of this egiecies ofconmerce
although some of its citizens were the las
to desist froina traffie so gainful.. How fat
the opinions of individuals, or of sebts,-d
colonies, in New England, .were affected
by the onproductiveness of slave labor. it
istiot imaterial to inquire; but it is nht ro
be denied that .African- slaves cisteclat
the Declaration rof Independence in all the
coloises. The Southern States itisiste
in the Cuanention, that 'tiis'importatiot
of slaves into their borders should not be
prohibited: by the-plan "of .overnment to
be adoted, and -proifosed that the 'oArol
q'rtshotd be reserved to the States, oi
that the - right to make such importations
should, for a. limited time, be -guarantie]
to oS ther- delegaies decla'red.-i e
aversion-of their constituents to a polley ac
odion; -and their own uncompromising
tiostili!y to a ebmnmerce io inhnmko. Mr.
Baldwin. of Georgia, regarded the objec'
tion o this el'auseas "an ttempt to abridge
one of the favorob 1p'e'ogatives of the
STieth;".ane, declared that Georgia was
"decided 6n the point." Mr.- Williamson,
of North Cirolla, "thought the Southern
$tates could not he members of the union,
if ths 'elause should. be rejected." Mr.
Rutledge, of South Carolina, said: "f
'the'con'vention think that North Carolina,
South Carolina and Georgia will ever
agree to the-plan, unless their right to im
port slaves be -untouched, the expectation
is vain." Mr. Sherman, said "It was
better to let the Southern States import
slaves, than to part with them, if they
made it a sinequa non." The year eigh
teen hundred was designated by the com
mittee to which the subject had been re
ferred, as the period when the importation
should cease. Mr. Pinckney. of South
Carolina? moved, in the convention, to
strike out eighteen hundred, and insert
eighteen hundred and eight. This motion
was seconded by Mr. Gorham, of Massa
chusetts, and prevailed.
When the power of amendment was
tinder consideration, Mr. Rutledge moved
a pro iso, that no amendment of the Con
stitution, prior to eighteen hundred and
eight, should aff'ect.the rightsof the States
to itmiport slaves. He declared that "he
cotld never agree to a power by which
the itrticle relating to slaves might he al
tered by the States not interested in that
property and prejudiced against it." On
each of these propositions Massachusetts
gave her vote in favor of that "inhuman
arid abominable traffic," as the gentle
rrin fron Massachusetts, (Mr. Winthrop.)
is pleased to characterize the. petty triade
in this District. Sir, upon these facts, I
submit it to that gentleman, and his cdn
stit uebts, to pronounce whet her it becoies
him to utter this denunciation of his own
Conimonwealth. -
In the articles of confederatiol no pro
vision existed for the recovery of slaves
that fled from their masters to States in
which slaery had been abolished. ..In
some of the Eastern States the right of the
owner to recapture his fugitive slave as
denied; a nd In one of them, the attempt
to i-etake d 'slave that had escaped wvas
openly rcdicd by the violence of a mob.
The inisettirity to property arising from the
facility of escape, end .the .diflicnlty andl
ha~tard of i-ecovery, induced the Southera
States to require a provision, in the nat-urt
of a treaty stipulation, iletsveen the States,
for the surrender of fugitive slaves. Thai
provision in the Constitution was assented
to, not only by every State,.but by every
member of the convention. .It is a dis
tinct and unequivocal recognition of prop
erty in slaves-an admission that suct
property shall lie protected by the laws o.
each Stare, and an obligation on each ;c
aid the uwner in the recotery of his fugi
tive slave.
In adjusti:.2 the bai dIrideatiot
iii the 'popular branch' of Ctdress, th:
Southefti mtats insisted (ibdt slaves shduk

whicli they deemed disparaging, to~ tiji
f'reembat4 and odtotis to the people of thi
North..
ir. Butler and. General .Pinckney, o
South Carolina, contended that black:

Morris and others declared their insupera

)n. this point the Northern add Easter

whleh thiree-Bths of the slaves are enume

4aers'and -are unworthy to bear their
hoored names, if they did. not repel, as a
Stain op, their " own personal hoa or any
reflections upon the morality of theirinti

Itis -dmitted bythe gentleman froi
New York; that Congress iptrexercaie no
jutisdiction over'slavery in the States, and
-tbat wheiher publicopinion -in- the North
and West be hostifet6 that institution,.is
an ,inquiry that'bas 6o 'relevaicy to the
'iluestiob ader debate; and yet, witbqut
purpose'or. propriety. heschooses gratni
tously 'idd wantonly 'to introdoce rhat
topic into this discussiotr.
The municipal regulations and dovnestic
policy ofra State are con iderations which
address themselves 'to its own cit
izens; and this hall is nutitle foruin in
which they are to'be'discnsse.d. Whilst I
will protfi 1ly :repel any imputiidn upon
the. institutionS of; my State, I. am -e
strained, no less by myuwn. self esteem
'han a just respect 'for ny corstttuets,
fromuenteridsg-itnotay iddicanotr orthen
IetC But, sir, I 'cboose to say, that lan
guageeensiot utt'er the scorn wth.-which
ihe'South 'contemns an deispses the u'p
:eart and: huckstering nmorality which
strives to: hold'tip to t'e reprobation. aft
.the worlid that ancient institutian .t'owhich
it ascribes muclj ibat' is il'ustfinedin 'is
history and ennobling i iitsPoliey. And,
sir, as a'Southern ina,) cast -b'@k to
gentlemn every offensive -word and eli
iet whicbhey nay be c6n'scions of hav
ing applied, to it in -this discussion. The
gentleman from flew York ,exhibits irrita
tation and resentment if -tnyof reproach,
toan instituto wi'l WAbich my coastittu
ents and. myself are i'eitifed.;. and if my
language is ofensiVe to hinm, 1 acIori-wl
edge the ;right of the. anegry to detern'ine
the mode and measures of his redress.
Sir, let him.who caters for- the -shouirs of
tie mobs of tWe .1tiib, address to. them
such topics as may be suited 'o 'itei'logie
-it is niouijsine'ss of nine but I protest
that ihe slang of the husting s be not intro
duced ii.thedebates of this 'House..
In proceeding .now, sir, t'ei cousider the
precise question before the House, I shall
onfine my remarks to the cardinal posi
tion-the ;'head and front"-of the argu
inot which urges the abandonment of the
rulo against the reception 'of iucendiary
petitions and nmemorials.. The duty of
the House to rescind .hat lte is assumed
as the correlati've o'f the right of petition ;
and it is conceded, that if Congress has no
urisdictin over the- matter of the' peti
ion-no power to grant its prayer-the
ights of the citizen are not. nbridge'd by
tbe rejection of the petition in the most
summary manner. That Congress should
o as act so idle and nbgatory as to en,
terain memorials upon subjects clearly
not embraced within tho sphere of its
powers. is a proposition so manifestly ab
urd, that no one is'-found to maintain it.
The memorials excluded by the rule
which it is sought to abrogate-whatever
else they may contain-pray that slavery
be abolished in the District of Columbia ;
and it is asserted that the right of "exclil
sive legislation" iii this District, which is
conferred by the Constitution, delegates to
Congress the power to. abolish slavery.
The fundamental principles of civil liberty
repel the idea that Congress possesses
such a monstrous power of confiscation
rver the rights nod property of the citi
en-a-power no less repugnant to the
thory of our Federal Government, and
the limitations of the Constitution, than
to the statutes of Maryland and Virginia,
by which the territory of the District was
ceded to the Government of the United
States.. -
Upon this clause or the Constitution,
id the statutes of -Virginia, and Mlary
land, the jurisdiction of Coligrese over the
ubject of slavery, so far; has been rested;
nd T must be psrmitied to say, that the
argument against its jurisdict ion is conclu
~sive and unanswerable. Yes, that vagrant
fiend, which, in the unohtrusive and peace-'
ul name of petition, wages a merciless
nd infamous war of plunder and massa
cre against the South, has been driven
id'i the Constitution, .under which it
sought shelter; then, like some grillty
thing, it tiinidly and meanly skulkpd be
hind the obselete rules and exploded prac
tice of the British House of Commons ;
but it has been dragged from even this
iserable retreat.
But, sir, oilier views of ihis question
e suggested by the htiutery and provisions
of the Constitdtin, io which I invite the
bttention of the House4 and unless i greatly
ver-estimate their imporante, they Will
omonstrate that Congre ss possesses not a
power connected with the mubjesti* fla
vey, that was not desiged to protect and
defend it, no less against domestic attack
than foreign invasion.
No subjeti e!at was submitted to th
Convention which framed the Constitution
o' the. United States, engaged more ear
nestly and anxiously the deliberations of
that auigust body, or brought into more
alarming collission the sectional prejudi
es of its members, than that of slavery.
The South cherished it as a policy which
she cbuld never abandon for any plan of
Union, and at once atitmneed her uitsi
terable purpose to: maintastr-it.. The
Northern and Eastern Stases, entertain
ing-the most settled 1rejudices against-it,
after much reflection, and -i consideration
of sectional advantages so be derived from
-a confederation .with the Southern States,
comproised their repugnance, and, as
sented to provisions in the plan of a fede
ral government which wvere deaigned to
guarani atid'. protect this species icf jfr'o
arty in:-ii6' SoutheS States. It bas now
r Congress the power to "provide Ior call
ing forth tbe militia 1o execute the laws of
'tre-Union, suppress insurrections and re
t pel ig'vasios," -aId to-.itnpose ~upion tiWe
I United States the duty of "protecting each
t of them. against- invasion" and ."against
I domestic violence," was under considera
tion, Northern delegae(s again protested
ga'inst the importation of slaves.- Mr.
Kingiof Massachusetts, said. "the object
of thegeneral system is defence- agai's't:
foreign inyasion,-.and defence against in
ternal sedition ;' and objected to the im
pt;rtation of slaves, as increasing the dan
ger of sedition in . one part of the United
States, which another.was bound to de
fend. -Mr. Gouverneur Morris.- said:
"They 'the Northern States) ire 'to bind
themselves to march their militia- for the
defence of the nulthern States, for their
defence.agaidst these very slaves agairst
whom they complain." ."The Southern
States'(said he) are not to 6e restrained
from importing fresh supplies of wretched
Africanis,;at .once to increase 'the danger of
attack and -difficulties of defence. Nay,
they are6to be encouraged to it, by tie as
sirrance of having -their votes-in the na
tional legislature.increased'in proportion."
These, sir, are the provisions of the Con
stituion'-which embrace the powers grant
ed by th'e S'tates to the Federal Govern
ment-their organ and instrument in re
lation to -the sub inct of slavery. Their
character and :objects are defined in the
daiscussions which they underwent by the
authors of the Constitction ; and they de
monstrate that Congress has no otherju
riediction over slavery, than the mere
ministerial in-qualified power of aiding
,the States.in enforcing the absolute rights
of the master.
But, sir, slaves held ender the lawvs of
the several States. at the adoption of the
-Constitution. are not only recognized as
property by the Constitution, but the right
to import natives of Africa. to be held as
property, is secured to the.States until the
year 180S,.on the single condiibi that i
tax not exceeding ten dollars. each might
he imposed. on them; the Northern and
Eastern States thus.aissenting to the traffic,
and actually ' participating in its enolu
ments.
Theso . are the. compacts 'ebtkeen the
Northern and Eastern and the Southern
States; and the obligations and duties of
the. former to protect and guaranty the
propr'ty fifhe ratter in slaves. 'T'hey be
come the comspacts: and obligations of any
new State, ascoditins of admission into
the Union.
Equal reyeesnination ia the Senate, and
the right of a majority in Congress to
enact laws regulating commerce and nav
igation, are the specific equivalents which
were rindered by the South for these stip
ulations in relation to slaves. In a note
i6 the deliats in the Convention, Mr.
Madison says. an understanding took place
betwsed the North and South on the sub
jects of navigation and slavery, and thus
is'exilained the votes of the Eastern States
on all the provisions contiected with the
lattek.
If, sir, this Government were ndt the
tiere agency of the States, exercising no
other powers than those that have been
delegated for specified objects and purpo
se$ and therefore limited in its action, it
still.would be bound, .6y all the sacred ob
ligations that treaties impose upon 'nations,
to abstain from any at t that impairs the
titltor.value of that property which it has
so distiunctly and amply guarantied to the
South. I deeply regret to say that these
guaratiesof the Constitution have been
shaniefully violated by States that liave
enjoyed largely the advantages of the com
promiises on which they are founded. The
Commonwealth of Massachusetts has pro
ceeded to the utmost verge of State sov
ereignty, to prevent the recovery of a le
gitive slave within her limits, by inter~po
sing the shield of her laws for hisprotec
.tion.- Similar statutes have been enacted
in the States of New York, ,1enrisylyiia
and Vermont. Encouraged by the seci
rity of such legislation, an immense ntith
her of slaves has fled to the non-slavehold
ing States; and in no solitary instance
has one been restored to.his master.. Such
inducements to escape have .rendlereil
.slaves comparatively. of little value to e!O
terminous States; and must- evisntdall
render tiiem utterly worthless.. .it in .not
disgutised that individ,nals habituallyt in
stigate and aid thefi to fice fronm their
diwners, iri fidatio'n if'.the lairs or'thie
slayehoJdiog States; and when , ibse fel
ens have beena demanded under the terais
of ite Censtitatitdo, as i-ceotly hasfen
done of this itutheities of New York, Mas
bachusetts and Maine, the demand, in ev
bry instane has. been refused; and the
refusal of the requisition has been put on
the insulting pretence that their lawes do
not recognie- the "right of one man to
hold property in his fellow-wan;" and
therefore a slave cannot be the subject of
-larceny, even in States where slavery er
Sisted.
-.,But, sir, thse danger which. renaces. the
-domestic institutions of the. don'th is not
f confined within, the fltiiits of the non
I glaveholding States. A band of orn
Sieid and- wieckless incandiaries, 'embof
