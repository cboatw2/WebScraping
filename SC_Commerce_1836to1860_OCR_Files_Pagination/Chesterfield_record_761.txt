Having thus briefly touched at the cans- I
4 ttf our .present oinbarrasmcnt.s let us
now took to fho remedy. This is plain
and palpable. The triumph of Whig
principles, and the administration of tho
Government by honest and capable inon,
can alone giy^us relief. This is a truth wo
would, iipprjbss upon tho honest mon of
all parties. Tho people know that if John
Tyjor luul not proved a traitor to his pn.
litioal friends, we should now huvo had an
old fashioned U. S. Rnnk in full opera*
tion; Commerce, Agriculture, and Man*
u fact urea, would havo onco more flourish'
odf and in consequence, the pcoplo would
have compelled the General Govornmcnt
to come forward in support of the credit
of the States. His treachery has almost
ro-consignod us to the slsugh of Loco focoism
; and it remains for the people to
detsrmino whether they will extricate
themselves and the country from tho deep
disgrace into which we hnve fallen, or
svhather the curses and abominations of a
hard mooted Government and a pauper
population, are to be entailed upon us for*
ever t>y the triumph of our political op.

EimortAN Agricultural Tour anj Survey.
We invite attention to tho article on the first
pago under the abovo title. Mr. Cohnaa's reports
of his Agricultural Survey of Massachusetts
ore among the most valuable papers on the subject
of agriculture ever given to the public in this coun.
try. That his reports from Europe will be of in.
calculable value to the country can be doubted by
no one who has read hie Massachusetts reports and
who knows any thing of European agriculture.?
Although the crops, the soils, the climates, and
the laborers of Europe are all different from ours,
particularly in the southern states, still tho general
principles wluch sro at the foundation of improve,
ments in soils and crops are the same in ah coon,
tries and climates. An intelligent agriculturist
cannot read a good report of a *r?od system of general
agriculture in any p?rt of the world without
profit.
We return our thanks to tlio H >n. John Campmix

Mr. Berrien mado a report from tho
Judiciaty Committee on the bill of the House,
and a bill of the Senate to repeal the bank,

from the House be so amended as not to repeal

of creditors to forco a debtor to bankruptcy. On
the 6th Mr. Archer moved a reconsideration of the
the vote on the Oregon bill. Tho question of re.
consideration was postponed till the next day. On
the same day the Senate look up an Exchequer
bill on the table, and Mr. Tsllmadgo ma Jo a very
able speech on tho subject of the currency.
On the 7th tho motion to reconsider the question
*>n the Oregon bill was taken up and lost, by a
vole ef 34 to 34; not a majority for it. Had this
quasi ion and vote been on the passage of the bill
it would have been lost.
On tho scmo day Mr. McDuffic submitted resolutions
in favor of adopting measures to revive tho
commerce of tho country, increitc its revenue, and
prevent the accumulation of debts; also for modi,
fying the tariff to a strictly revenue standard, and
retrenching expense*. On the next day, Mr.

and nothing else of much importance.
A very interesting scene was exhibited in tho
House of Representatives on tho 7th. Mr. Hum.
mora, of Va., presented to Congress in the name of
Sxmukl. T. Washington, a grand nephow of
General Washington, tho War-Sword of the General,
and a cane bequeathed by I>r. Franklin to
General Washington. Mr. Summers nccompa- i

that the thanks of Congress bo presented to Mr.
Washington, and that the urticles bo deposited in
the State Depart invnt, which was adopted, ~ On
motion of Mr. Taliaferro the addreasos of Messrs.
Summers and Adams were entered on the journal.
The House then adjourned, though early in the
day.
Tho next morning tins resolution was adopted
by tlio Senate, after a few eloquent and impressive
remarks by Mr. Archer and tho Senate adourncd.
TEMPERANCE.
In the large, wealthy, and populous district of
Newberry such has been tire influence of tho Tern- i
pcrunno Reform upon public opinion, that at tho
January meeting of tho Commissioners of Roads,
the time when it was usual for rctuilers to apply
for a renewal of their liconscs, thrre teas not a
tingle application. Such a tiling has probably
not occurred in any district in the state before,
since the present license system went fully into
operation.
At Laurens C. II. the last retail shop has recent,
ly been closed; and tho Commissioners have determined
to grant no licenses for tho district.
Mr. Carey is now in Charleston Iscturing on
Temperance.
We see in a Columbia paper an advertisement
offering for sale a quack nostrum on the recommendation
of "two members of Congress from South \
Carolina." The Hon. S. II. Butler recommends ;
it as " highly valuable in colds, because" he certi- 1
fics " I have experienced rolief from it mysolf, and '
I can safely recommend it as possessing great 1
healing powers.'" Tho Italics are so marked in '
the certificate. Tho Hon. James Rogers adds: 1
" I havo tried the above medicine, and mnnir i>n. 1
tircly in Mr. Butler*? opinion." 1
JVe autor ultra crepidam. If members of Con- '
gross would confine the publication of their opin- 1
ions and cortificatcs to the subject of national politics
and President-making?tlio ono in which a large (
proportion of them sccin to feel the deepest interest, 1
and with which they arc, generally, somewhat acquainted?they
would be less upt to fall into ludicrous
mistakes, than in making publications on
Therapeutics and Mutcria Mcdica. Tho only
" healing" power in Therapeutics (known to those J
who understand the subject) is the via medicatrix 1
natur.k. Suppose Mi# power to be extinguished 1
in the animal body to which tho 44 Life Preserver" 1
of " tho two members of Congress from South 1
Carolina" is applied, and what would be tho effect c
produced by its 44 great healing powers" ? The 1
lunguagc of the honorable gentlemen is about as "
correct as it would be to sjteak of the propclliug
power of the grease and blacklcud applied to u F
wagon wheel. All intelligent physiologists know '
that in healing processes in tho animal economy, 1
medicines act only by removing obstacles out of 1
nature's way, or by aiding nature in removing or 1
overcoming them. The 44 hculing" is dono by
nature herself. If the Honorable 44 members of *
Congress" apply to a physician a dozen times, and '
ho relieves them each time of their 44 colds," though 1
in all the successive instances, a change of symp- I
torus requires a change or modification of treat,
ment, they think nothing of it- 'Treating diseases 1
is his vocation. He has studied it, understands it,
and therefore succeeds in it. But if they apply to
an ignorant empiric,?or what is inorc common, if
he applies to them for permission to cxi>criinent
upon thorn, sad kin ?qnriinoi?t fnils, nothing is
said about it. But if his nostrum happens to suit
the particular variety and stage of " cold*' from
which tticy sulTcr, they arc in f.ipturcs that u fellow
so ignorant should know how to cure a cold,
und they give liiin an unqualified ccrtificuto of
their confidence in him, or rather, in his " modicine,"
as a general cold-curcr; and that without
referonco to the variety or stage of tho cold?to '
constitution or age?to climate or season?to the '
effect upon tho secretions, whether cutaneous, re- (
nal or mucous?whatever may bo the state of the 1
body, whether sthenic or asthenic?whether it suf- '
fcrs from plethora or depletion?whether it needs 1
bleeding or stimulants, starving or stuffing?whatever
may havo been the previous stato of health?
whatever organ may be atfectcd, however, and to
whatever extent; let the disease only he called " a '
cold," and whatever tho symptoms, this is " tho
best medicine." Because the Honorable gentle,
men once " tried'' travelling up tho river from the I
mouth of Potomac Creek, and thus they reached
Washington City, do they thcrofurc infer that by
travelling up the river from Ceorgotown, Balti- e
more, Philadelphia or Columbia, they will also
reach Washington City ? No. Why do they
not ? Because they understand tlic subject matter
of consideration, and know better. We repeat
the adage: Ne tutor ultra crepidam.
Wo mean no disrespect to the " two members of
Congress from South Carolina." Nor can the
most fustidious allege that there is any indelicacy r
in inf pn/liir?t in?a nf llioir nnmou tnfn r??ir n/.Iimana I
in connection with this subject. They gave tlio ?
certificates (supposing thcin to be genuine) with
their names appended by themselves, evidently for
the purpose of being mado public, and thereby
challenged public scrutiny.
The small pox is now prevailing to more or less
extent in Ronton and New Orleans, and one or
two small towns in Mississippi. It was stated in
tlio Columbia Chronicle two or tlirco weeks since,
on the authority of a letter from Charleston, that
it existed ulso in that city.
We see advertised in the Georgetown Observer,
u negro man committed to the jail of Williams,
burg 44 who says his name is Jim, nnd that lie be.
longs to Neal MoBride of Chesterfield District."
If the law requires nothing to be done to inform
the owners of runaway slaves taken up and commit,
ted to jail, except to advertise in any paper which
the sheriff or jailor may select for that purpose, it
ought to be amended. It is the interest of sheriffs
or jailors to retain slaves as long as they can, be

THE SO-CALLED MERMAID.
"We have examined the production recently exhibited
at the Masonic Hall purporting to be " the
most wonderful curiosity in the world?the Mermaid."
This pretended wonder is formed by the artificial
union of two very distinct and widely separated
species?an Ape and a Fish.
The form of the head?the presence of hands
with flat nails, and the long canine tocth, prove
that the upper part of this compound belongs to
the order quadruinana or four handed animals,
which arc composed of many genera and species,
[hat arc usually called by tlie general name of
Monkey* The presence of check pouches, which
n this dried specif011 are thrust upwards on tho
:hcck bones, announco ii to Ijavo been an inhabitant
of the old world and not ol' iliP V.C-vr, as no
Ymcrtcan Monkey has as yet been discovered
with these appendages. The specimen has been
nueli distorted and disguised in the preparation;
t appears, however, to be that of an African spesies,
frequently seen in the managcrics of the tinted
States.
Tho lower part is the tail, together with the skin
if the body of a Fish of the order Malacoptcrygii
Ybdominalin of Cuvicr, which includes a large
umily of fishes whoso rays are all soft, followed
>y a second one, small and adipose.
The method which has been adapted to iinposo
his gross deception on the public, is the following.
Hie body of a Monkey, (the hips aud lower cxrcmilieu
having been removed,) is inserted into
ho skin of the Fish deprived of its head?the vorcbral
column of the Monkey descending eight or
en inches into the fish's skin. The termination
if the fish skin upwards can be traced without
nueli difficulty round the body, resting on the
kin of the Monkey which passes underneath.
This caricature of nature is rendered inoro aburd
when we tukc into consideration that we

down the river to form an escort. The military
turned out extemporaneously in their gorgeous

thronged the wharf, on foot, on horse back, and in

of assuring you of the unfeigned satisfaction your

who disdain, on this occasion, to bo recognised
hy any party designations. Our municipal authorities,
our military companies, our scientific,
literary and professional men, our farmers, me.
chanics and merchants?all, sir, of every trade,
calling and vocation, unite with one voice
in the offer of their cordial salutations, and in ten.
dering to you the hospitalities of this ancient city.
This, sir, is the spontaneous homage which an in.
telligcnt, discerning and virtuous community, arc
ever ready to pay to great talents, to exalted worth,
und to eminent public services.
" Your connexion with public affairs embraces u i
period of more than thirty years, and when it is re. |
mcmbcrcd, that during the time, you have been
called to participate in the control and manage. <
mcnt of almost ui*cry department of the public service,
and that you have excrtC'' ? marked and decisive
influence upon those great niC.ast.'TO which
lave been proposed ,-s proper to fix and scttio til?
ralicy of the government, it is obvious, that the '
events of your life and the history of the republic '
ire so blended, that the pages which record the one
nust include the other. During your long, ardu.
>us, and conspicuous career, it could not be exicctcd,
that you would escape- those angry party
collisions which urc inseparable from free governncnt.
Nor could it be supposed, that the prcju. j
liccs and passions which these collisions seldom j(
'ail to excite, would exempt your conduct from a
Kccasional, unjust and illiberal criticism. But like [
ill bad feelings and passions, their duration has j
Keen brief. They have vanished before the light p
if truth, und given way to those sentiments of jus- ice
and liberality which the American people
vill ulways tiltimutely entertain towards their '
uithful public servants. And now, sir, when you ^
tavc withdrawn from the perplexities and cures of (,
>ublic business, und sought in retirement the re- ?
>ose so congenial to the evening of life, it cannot
mt be gratifying to behold the cheerfulness with !
which your countrymen every where, and of eve- ^
ry party, hear witness to your ardent and lofty patriotism
and to tho purity und intcgiity of your political
life.
44 We of Mobile, in an especial manner, owe you
a debt of gratitude for your patriotic efforts in inducing
the government to wrest from tho dominion
of tho King of Spain this interesting section
of the Union. Those who were opposed to this
step, were alarmed at, and deprecated the wrath
of Great Britain, which they supposed would be
roused against us by any interference with the ter- 1
ritories of Spain, tlton her friend and ally. But
as it formed no part of your creed to take counsel
from tho imaginary fears of the colossal power of
the mistress of the seas, you fearlessly and eloquently
maintained our right to the possession of tho
country, and demonstrated (lie policy and propric.
ly of subjecting it to our lawn. Mobile was then
an obscure village, a mere dcj>endcncy of a Spanish
military |K>st?you now behold it a city of extensive
commerce, and the emporium of one of
he largest staple States in the Union. For this,
tir, and for all the distinguished services you have
rendered this great country, we tender yon our 1
thanks and gratitude, und again I bid you wcl.
come, thrice welcome to tltc Slate of Alabama."
We have not space for the eloquent reply of Mr.
Clay. ]

The two mates of the brig Poukney, of Balti.
more, attempted ubout the 25tl? November, to
murder the captain und take the vessel, which at
the time was on a voyage to South America. The
f>lan seems to have lieen badly concerted and worse
executed. The Captain was knocked down late
at night, whilst he was p issing up tire companion
way, hy one of the mates; the other mate immcdi
*??ly wcnton dc.sk to prevent the crew froin intcrfcrin??
by telling them that the captain had a scuffle
ivith the second mate and would certainly shoot
tny of tlieni who might enter the cabin. Soine
if tliem, however, did enter and save the captain's ;
life. One of the mutes is said to be from Charleson,
and well educated. Tlieso facts are stated '
>y the captain of a vessel which arrived in Boston y
"rom Pcrnambuco. The plot seems not to have been f
.ommuuieuted to any of the crew. Those who (
would have McKcnzic convicted of murder for c
executing Spencer and others for plotting a simi- |
ar clime, may derive some comfort from this. If r
>iracy on board American vessels is what they ?
wish, it would seem they arc likely to be gratified.
Since the above was put in typo we have re.
