aluiaaf ersothnate
and. House of Representatives:
In my last annual Message to your prede
cessors, l.oangratulated them on the ap
parent daWAbf a new era in our prosperi
ty, whi-egL e5tdmight be permanent.
The-curre erbadreached, and I a m hap
py to say;, has' continued to maintain a
sound conditji4n. Ggmmerce, trade, and
nanufactures,. were flourishing, as they
yet flourish in most parts of the civilized
dairld;iand it'wssmiaturalfto supifoss'ttra
agriculture must also revive. But w.e
hive been disappodinted. AgainsLihe

as ilte'lad~s. are chiefly: directed hgainst
the-manufacturing mupremencv of Eng
land. they-fall'with peculiar: weight upon
that great.agriculturalstaple on which our
prosperity-depends.. -The:price. of -cotton
throughout the world i& and must for-our
time, in -all probability, - continue to he
regulated'ly'the prices in:Liverpool- Its'
value in - that:'market depends: upon the
condition of the cotton manufacturers -in'
England; and the tariff laws ofothercouta
trier, which check the foreign demand for
English cotton goods,-must' necessarily
lower the price of the Taw - material i'
Liverpool, white-it rises'nowhere 'else; but
on the contrary falls everywhere witb tie
fall in that'great nart,through:which passes
two-thirds of the crop of the whule world:
No matter, where.~coiton manufacturers
flourish,:unless in -Etigland, cotton cannot
hear a fair price; and every attempt to.
build them up artificially elsewhere is at
immediate cost of the cotton grower. Did
they naturally spring , up under a system
of universal free trade, and in . wholesome
competition with England. they would in
dicate an actual increase of :consumption,
and- prove highly beneficial to us.-But
tariff laws, though they may alter the
channels of trade, and in doing so produce
as they invariably.do much misel:ief,-have
no power to increase consumption. On
the contrary, by increasing the manufac
turers prices where the, are in force, they
necessarrily diminish it, and -thereby-de
preciate the raw material. Such laws may
take from one and bestow upon another,
to the injury of the whole, but they cannot
create wealth. How long the present
state of things will continue, and in what
it will terminate, cannot be foreseen; but
the fadt appears to be clearly .established,-.
for the-flrst time .in the history of the world,
that by the skill of political jugglery, trade,
commerce, and mannfactures may be
made to flourish, and a sound currency
exist, while agriculture, the acknowledged
mother of them all,'-aud particularly that
branch of agriculture which furnishes them
with their life-blood, is sunk to the lowest
ces, during the past year, amounts to three
hundred and six thousand eight hundred &
thirtylone dollars and sixty-three cents,
($306.831-63). The expenditures during
the same period have reached the sum of
threehundred and forty-seven thousand
seven hundred and four dollars and sixty.
three cents. t$347,704 63); of which.
however, fifty-six thonsand four hundred
and eighty-three dollars and seventy-three
cents, ($56,48:3 73), have been applietd to
the redtuctiotn of the pricipal of the public
debt. The current income has therefote
exceeded the ordinary e-xpernses of the
State by the sum of fieen thousand six
hundred and ten dollars atnd twenty-three
cents, ($15,610 23). The balance in the
Treastury at the close of the year, (a por
tion of it however, subject to undrawn ap
propriations) amounted to seventy thou
sand five hundred . and six dollars and
fifty-nine cents, ($70,506 59), to which
may be added about eight thiou-satd dol
lars, being the unexpended balance ol the
contingent funds placed in the hands of
the Executive.
The direct, taxes levied and collected
for the use of the St ate, amounted this
year to two 'hundred and seventy-seven
thousand five hundred and sixty-two dol
lars and forty cents, ($277.562 40). And
during the same period there has been also
collected from the 'people .the additional
sum of one,. hundred and otne thousanid
four hundred and twenty-eight dollars and
ninety-t wo cents, ($101,428 92); and du'.
ring the year i843, one hundred and three'
thousand sevent hundred and twenty-nine
dollars and ninety-two cets, ($102,729
92),'or about an average' of thirty-seven
per cent. of the State taxes annually,
which has been assessed by the Commis
sioners-of the Poor, of Public Buildings,
and of Roads and Bridges, in the differet
Districts. 'I have had accurate accounts
kept of the taxes thus levied and collected
for tbiese years, that [ might apprize you
of their great amount, and call your atten
tiotnto the 'propriety of providing for a
more strict accountability for their appro
priatioc than has been hitherto exacted.
'These Commissioiris have been required'
to report, some of them.to the Comptroller
General,'and some tonthe Clerks of the
Courts; and. accoutdt with , them for the
monies received and~expendedi; but 1 am

It affords tme great pleasure to inform
you that t he tnijitia of the State are cam
pletely organized antd are. for militia, in
excellenit training. There are few officers
of .any grade wh6 are not familiar' with,
and competent to instruct the men in the
dillieranut schools of in fantry tactics. and
in camp du,ies. The artillery on the Coast
is in flne condition, and t he calvary throug
out the State numerous, well mounted,
and well drilled in the sword exeercise, and
the manoeuvres appropriate to tbat arm
of service. The whole nuimber of the
militia amonts to near fifty-five 'thousand
officers and men.
There are now in the State arsenals, itt
order for service, ten thousand five hun
dred muskets, rifles, and carhines, one
hundred and two pieces of artillery; thirty
thousands pounds of powder;~ and twenty
five thousand pounds of lead, besides-a
large quantity of b alls and cartridges. The
other nmihtary- stores and eqaipmlents are
in proportion. The nutmber. of public
arms in the lhands'of the:militiaiannot

ry system it iaintain her-in Ii s'position
for the future%. -.
IIn fact the mnilitary 'expenses. of the
prese 'sstem greatly extended..h'y a
chane whice- can be 'readily effected.
Tjers tare- no good :reasons why ,'there
s'hottld be two Arsenalse ins the State, or
that they should be plae'eat the two most
pxpensie points in it-Charleston and
Columbia. A -few hundred stands of
arms, given to charge of the City'Gotilabils
of these places,- would be all that could be
required, -if siadeed,-they woould be ioeces
saryt for their' protection in an emergency;

spot might be found on one or the other
branch of the rail-road, which affords such
facilities for.- transportation that a posi-2
ti('in anywhere upon it would be as con
venient'for military pnrposes as at Char
leston or Columbia. The sale of the ar
senal and magazind bildings and grounds
at these places, would I hav' little doubt.
furnish ample funds. for erecting a brick
arsenal and extensive wooden barracks in
the country, without requiring A dollar
from the Treas'ry. - The coajsohdation of
the two schools would enable :ou to dis
pense .with one set of Professors andother
officers, which, with the cheapness of liv
ing and the number of pay students that
might be expected if the situation was
known 'to-'b perfectly healthy, wild .in.
all probability reduce the'expenditure to
one-half the sum now appropriated to their
support. That amounts, at present, to
about twenty-eight' thousand dollars. In
suggesting this plan, I by no means desire
to be understood as recommending any
chaage as regards theschool system. ' It
is reat .improvenient on that of a hired'
g'ard, anid the cadets are as'eflicient pro
tectorabrthe arsenals as the guards were;
nithrbeic, anything'more than nomtinal
ly so. The cadets utnited iii one body. and
increased by at unlimitted titmber of pay
students. would alhr-J aonple proidcttou;
while so finea school, at a haalthy location
in' the coiinrry, would induce a large pro
portion of the rising generation to ptepare
themselves for future service, both milita
ry and civil by embracing its advantages.
The -policy 'he-retofore pursued, ofrepair
ing'daiaged arms, is questionable. They
are,. for the most part, not worth the ex
pense. -The appropriation of t wo thoas
and dullais per annum, for repairing arms
and arsenal purposes, m y, I think, in
any event, be henceforth judiciously cur"
tailed ond-half.
I iransmit you a report made to me by
our very efficient Adjutant Gen'eral, whose
recommendations are entitled to your se
rious attention; and- also interesting Re
ports from the military schools.
Permit me to renew to you a'recom
mendation which -I made to your prede
eessois, to establish a central academy at
some- suirabl3 point in every District in
tlie'State, with an endowment of a thous
and dollars a year to each. ryou are'
unwilling to aband'n the free-school sys
tem, and appropriate the funids to this ob
ject, I see no reason why twenty-eight
thousand dollars additional might'not be
aunually devored to - this important pur
pose.' Our expenditure would then'be far
short of that made by tnany of the' States
in this' Union, and in none.of them is a
more, liberal one requirdd than- in ours,
We have' but a few well conducted acade
mies, and these, as-soon as they acquire
any reputation, are inconveniently crowd
ed; and depending as they do for eir suc
a itpon tbe- cidential circolnsitance of
appreetated, ihey- isPTdabdispense their
advaniages to ihe same degree, for a length
of time. * Ou-. common schools are, for
.the most part, a disgrace to an erlightened
people. A system of-permooaae-acade
mies, liberally endowed, onb of whieh
would be within'the reach'ofevery citizen
conducted by such men as your appropri
ation, and the tuition funds would attra'ci
and' teaching uniformly a cotirse prescri
hd by the Trustees of the CoL.ege, would
produce a revolution iu tihe elu'caton of
the State in a few years. Thananual ex
penditure .would not equal tiat now in
curred for military purposes. NVhile I amn
far from censuring that experditure, and
trust that the apathty of a long peace may
not he allowed to delude u'- ipto false se
curity, still it is certain that,uuder God,
the, world is now mainly govo'ned by the
force of intellect; and ii is tle duty of a
wise Government to bestow'iis highstat
care uponi the mnental culture o ias people.
We have expended milliotns for internal I
improvements, which 'have neer yielded
a dollar of clear revenue to th TLre-asury,
nor perhaps brought a valuabe emigrant
or preserved an useful ettizen b us. The
interest of a single half tmilliozuppropria-v

In obedience to a resolution of the last see
sion, I have had the repairs made in the Secre
tary of State's offic", which were indispensabi
neressary for the preservaition lf.ti recor.ds
There are still many improvements .whicl
might be made in that office. and also in thi
Survevor General's, that would be both usefu
and coi'venient. The expense of them wa
greater than.f felt authorized to incur, wi.thou
censilting ie Legielature. I think it highli
expedient that a Commissioner should be ap
pointed to examine the condition-of these offi
ces. and report to you in detail upon them.
have heretofore recommended that all the Stat
officers-should be consolidated at the seat o
Government; that the Executive Departmen
should be properly organized; that a stated sal
ary should be given to the Secretary of State
in eu of perquisites, which are now his onkl
rompensation. tind that the Land Office shotik
be closed. The 4xperience of another year ha
monfirumed my opinion of the propriety and irn
portance of these measures, and I suggest then
agatin fur your consideration.
The power of appoiitiig Notaries Publii
has-been immnieinurtally exercised by the Exec
ufive. I- can find nu law conferring that power
nor can 1. indeed, find any miatute creating snc
ami office. It is recognized in some acts, an(
its authority is soimetimes specially limited ; bn
none of tlein prescribe its powers and duties
or fix its termn ot duration. The office -,rigina
ted in the Civil Law, wa. handed down witl
it to all modern nations, and probably has i
other at'thority here than that derived fron
usage. As it is held by hundreds in the State
and is more and more sought after, I think-yoi
would do well to legalize its existence, and rea
ul'ite its appointment, powers. and tenure
Much inconvenience, and sometimes seriou
evils, arise from the ignorance o' the caninoi
Mag istratesand their irregulat distribution ii
the Disliiets for which they are conmissitied
They are also undoubtedly too numerous. I
one Magistrate, and only one, was appointei
in each beat company in tte State, the numabei
I apprehend, would be nufficient, the locatiol
more convenient, and the chances o' procurin
the most intelligent citizens io fill a station si
responsible greatly increased. As, huwevei
bu: few of the Magistrates cant be -expected t,
be lawyers, or to have a law library at thei
command, I believeait to be indispeisable ti
the regular administration of ihe law withii
their jurisdiction, that a at anual should be com
piled and published,, by the authority of th
State, explaining in a clear manner the pot
ers and duties of' Magistrates, and prescrihin
the proper lorms of proceedings ii their couru
to which might be added a codificat.oi of th
conmoni and statute laws, and reported deci
ions with which it snecessary that they shoai
be familiar. The expense ofsuch a work- wotl
bear but a small pioporuon to its value to th
people at large, as wel I as the Mapstrates. Th
law strikes many of its severest bIows througl
the agency of the common Magistracy; and i
is but faiir that the huiblest as well as the higi
est citizen should be dealt with by the sam
rule. well defined atid thoroughly understuo

ests of any respectable 'portion.of iis.pe -pe,
as the Tariff Act or- 1842 considered in all -its
bearit.gs, is to the rihtis ind interests of the
Planting States of this Vonfedeiac'V. It might
naturally have been supposed, and probably it
was expected,..that this State, in conformity
with the principles she has so long professed,
and on which he had heretofore-acted. would
immediately- nullify thi-'A'C;bUt she, did not.
Closely dnited atthe.time wiith thgret Dem7
ocratic party of the Union on the general prin.
ciples ofgovernment. and on certai questons
of ederal policy of the utmost inoment-lee
ing that this p arty had carried the elections to
the House of Representatives by a large ma
ority-and justly regarding it as pledsed to
free trade, and bound to repeal this exhorbitanot
Tauiff,.she paused, and. determined to await
the action of aniotber Congress; thus- furnish
ing a fresh, eiample of patriotic foibearande,
and sinceie devotiona to the peace aid integrity
of the Union. -The new .Congress' tnet; and
has terminated its first session. Propositions
were made in both branches to modify the Ta
riff, and signally defeated. .In the House,
where.the Democratic majority was large, the
proposition was disposed almost without de-'
bate, and a majority of the Democrats from-the
t States north ot the Potomac actually voted
against it; while in the Senate, some of the
leaders of that party from the same section did
so likewise. There seems, therefore, to be no
re .sonable, or even plausible ground. on which
to rest a hope that this law, so unconstitutional,
and so ruinous to'ns, will ever be repealed. or
reduced to the standard of the Compromise.
The friends of the Tariff do not appear to en
tertain the slightest idai of such a thing. They
have distinctly proclaimed it to be the sett!ed
policy ofthe Federal Government ; and, in fact,
they scarcely conceal that they regard our fur
'her remonstrance onthe subject-as intrusive
and pertinent. Nor could we, after the,."-'
contempt which they have. mnifested for ileir
plighted- fith,-repose with safety: upon any
concessions which they might, by circumstan.
'cei, be forced again to 'make.
With what confidence we may rely, on the
other hand;upon the . northern section of the
Democratic party to carry -out the' free trade
r principles which they profes,we are well ad
monished by .the history, not only of the "last
iiseioof Congress, but of the protective pol
icy itself. Theact of 1828,.the most stringent
Sof the Tariff acts, savethatof 1842, was carried
by th votes of the Democratic leaders of the
State of New York. Liven under very peculiar
circumstances; ind this last act, by the 'votes
of the Democratic leaders from the same State,
and from Pennsylvania. And it - may be 're
aded as -certain. that the friends of the.pro,
d tective system will be able, at all tims to com
e mand as many votes anong the northern Do
e mocrats as may he necessary for their purpose.
Nor *can we, I fear,' inticipate any demon.
st, aiion of ouch a fixed, determined, and com
biined. reiistance to that policy on -the part of
C the South, as will force the North-to abandon it
d entirely .For this apprehension- 'there are
t
r aypesoe: us. but one is paramount.. Unfor
Presidenae chosen by the people, in an the
Southern States exce:.t onr our own. They
are. in consequence, at all times almost equally
divided about men ; .'nd interested politicians
spore ho pains to impress itfon the voters. that
t esalvation of the country depends upon the
elevation of this or that individuil -to the Presi
dential chair. In this exciting contest, ties
f sures and principles become matters of.minor
consequence ; and though itis well known that
no President, whatever may have been his pl
liticatlcreed, has yet had firmness to veto a Ta
riff bill, however monstrous,' and, that no 'an
ointed candidate even.'-has ever been able fully
and consistently to declare himself against the
protective policy, they will persistin the per
micious del usion that, every thinig will he se
cured by the trinmph of their favorite. While
every other question, however vital to liberty
and the Constitution, continues to be made
subordinate to this,'and to be estimated solely
by its'influehce 'on the Presidential election:
and while that electidur continues to 'he made'
directly by the: masses, it is almost vain to ax

among themselves, or the. States ofanysetion

to resist effectually the usurpalion-of the Felle

Under these'circumstances ii''devolves' an
