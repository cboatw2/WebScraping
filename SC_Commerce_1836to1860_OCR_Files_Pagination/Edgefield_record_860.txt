THE LABOURiE's ITRNN
It is a standing argumnent wit-he W.higs
that they are for protecting Amhericau la
bour. and in order to do so have passed a
high Restrictive Tariff. .They argue -that
- ,it may be to the advantage of a man who
lives upon his-income t6obtain the manu
.factures he- consumes at a less price, but
the labourer will find it to his advantage
to pay more for the article he consumes,
provided. he is "protected" in his occupa
tion by'- the Government. and enabled
thereby to obtain higher wages for his la
bour.' This argument confessedly applies
'only to the classes who.produce protected
.-articles; a large and indeed by far the lar
ger portion of American, mechanics pro
-duce. articles which need no protection,
-and the operation of the Restrictive system
-on them is simply this. Labour being
*worth three or four times as much here as
in Europe, the productof one day's labour
- of one ofour-mechanics is worth in money
the-product of three or four day's labour
--of an European mechanic, and deducting
the cost of transportation. etc, the Ameri.
can mechanic can doubtless iOurchase with
the' money he earns iN his employment,
whieb needs no protection. twice as much
of these "protected," articles of foreign
uianufacture which he consumes as he
could make himself in the time he has spent
in earning that money. lI is to his interest
to get these articles as cheap as possible.
But. it is contended by the Whigs that he
will not get employment unless the Res
-,trictive system is upbheld. He can compete
9th. the foreigner without protection, his
*-prices are regulated by the supply and
demand, that must remain the same. If
-then he can porchase what he consumes
;cheaper from foreigners, of course he saves
that much from his income. It is not then
to the interest on'y of the class of persons
which lives on their incomes to buy where
-they -can b-uy cheapest: it' is also to the
,interest of every labourer in the land who
bas to consume the foreign articles.
. Bu thiere is the other class-the labour.
-ers who produce the articles which need
no-protection. These articles are notorious
ly those which are produced infactories
which require large capital to keep them
in operation. As an able writer remarks:
"A loom in Massachusetts will produce as
many yards of cloth in a day as a similar
loom would in Manchester, Lyons or
Hamburgh, and can be run at no very
disproportionate expense... The raw cotton
is cheaper here than it is there by the cost
of transportation. The interest on money
-Sii per cent Capitalists vaatt heav,er
:incomes than that interest would produce.
.Lay an impost of fifty per cent on every
-yard of cloth imported, and you raise the
-.price of every yard of cloth made here.
The man of capital. instead of lending his
-money ts the mechanic or the tradesmau,
-or the farmer at 6. per cent, invests it in a
manufactory and through the increased
price of cloth effected by the impost, is
etabled to realize from the sale of that
which his machinery tnakes,'a profil upon
-his capital of 15, 20, 30, and perhaps 40
per cent. It is he that is advantaged bv
the impost, it is his capital that is protected
:by the high duty, and he rolls in wealth
while the honest industry ofthe country
-;is impoverished in order that his gains may
* e great. This is the object of Whig
protection, this the design of the Whig
Tarilf. It sits like a heavy incumbus upon
,the breast of the honest labour. It sucks
like a huge insatiate leech the life blood
from the veins of domestic industry."
The labourer, whose wages are regulated
bry the general vaiue of labour throughout
-the country in all employmetnts, the
staprotected as well as te protected, gains
nothing by this protectiotn- it all goes to
ithe capitalist a ho owns the factory.
The Tariff anag the Tailers.-Every
iday furnishes some new- evidence of the
-oppression of thbe present. t'ariff, and by
pocricy of its advocates. We wvell recoI
lect that the tailors of New York were a
muorng the very first and loutdest in their
clamours for "protection." The bounty
oftbe Compromise was not sufficient for
then i they-disinmerested souls-could
ial afford to pay their journejmen ade
kluatenwages without a heavy duty on im.
poried clothinA. ,Wel, they were ~iuidul
ged-a dutty of 50 per cent. w as laid upon

the American needle. N~ow look at tte
sequel. Last week a piecession of' more

We learn that varioni railroad, compa
esis owning the routcs between Albany
and Bttfalo, at'a ntieting held in A ugust,
res.1'ed to reeomdtiend to the Towanda

raise the question of the validity .of .Ihe
Post Office laws, and the ohlfgations oft the
railroads under the laws of Congress; and
also the validity of their contracts restrict

AMissouri.-The lasi *iuumboi'of. the St.'

turns of the' late'election NinMissonri. The
majority of Edvards, the "Hard" caudi-c

opponent. is,5,65'. Four "Hards" Mes
srs: Price,-Bowliu. Phelps and Rilfe, and
one. I -Soft" -1 r. 'Sims, are elected to Con
gress. The whigs have elected 44 mem

the demaerhts 56. How many of the lat

Afaine Presidential Electors.-In case
the abolition vote in Maine shonld be so
large as to present either of the other
Electorial tickets from having a majority
of the whole number of votes polled; the
lact years legislature a large majority of
which are in favorof Polk and Dallas. will
appoint the Electors, thus, in the opinion
of the New York Tribune, rendering the
vote of that State at the next Presidential
election as morIly certain for the Demo
cratic candidates.
In North Carolina there are but seven
Democratic newspapers; while the Whigs
have twenty. This is a most significant
fact. If we can come within 3000 votes
of the Whigs with seven presses, we could
completely overwhelm them with twenty.
Democrats should suppert their papers
liberally, and establish new ones, give the
people light, circulate the docunents-the
price of liberty is eternal vigilance.-Boston

stole five horses from the enemy, and thus

The Cotton Crop.-We learn from
planters cultivating the bill land of some
portions of this county, that the worm has
become very destructive, eating up or
destroying whole fields of the growing or
ripening. crop. We observe accounts. of a
similar destruction in many of the counties

thinks he will lose .50 bales out of-a crop
of 300 bales.-Natchez Free Trader.

been very destructive to the cotton: Without

half crop will be gathered.
CRoPS IN THE WEsT.-The Opelousas Ga.
zette states that in consequence df the oImost
annual appearance of the .Cduerpillar .in, tile
Cotton fields of that district, many planterd are
making arrangements to turn their bottotn gino
into sugar houses. The same, we.tinderstand,
is in contemplation by many planteri oni ,tte
Red River. The frequent partial destiuction
of the crops in particular neighborhoodsj,.lo.
gether with the low prices which nowseemito
be established-for cotton, will no doubt induce
many planters to turn their attenfiotn to other
articles ofculture. Sugar will, of course, be
preferred, wherever the climate wiHl permit its
growth. . We. have no doiaht, however, that
still other articles might le adapted, which
would yield a better profit tihan cotton, or, per.
haps, than sugar.

sprea4 aind permanent, that the best of seasons
fron this out would d- but little towards re
lieving the injury. Ve happened, ia day or
two since, to fall into the company of a gentlo
man who hnd recently passed over a consider
shlo pait of the principal cotton-grb'wing par
tions of our State-and lie assures us that, in
the connfies of Clarke, Monroe, Wilcox, Dal
las, Lowndos, Montgoniery, Antanga. &c.,
there will be an average crop of at Yeast one
thiid less thar the product of last year.
CMuon Crop. of: Louisian.-ThO .receipts of
Cottotn at New Orleans for the year ending 31st
Aug. 1844, amount to 913,813.. bales, of which
5.945 are new. , For the fear edtirg 316 Au
gust 1843. according to .tfie An'A:fal Statesnent
of commerce of that city., the receiptswwere,
1,089.642 bales, of which 1.734 were e7. The
exports during the yearjust closed are 899,440
bales; for the previous year, 1 085,870 bales.
This statement does not include the Cotton
shipped coastwise without clearing, or shipped
up the riter. The receipts of Cotton for the
inonth of August, 1844, amounted to 9,022
bales,' and the exports for the month to 10,729
bales.
The editor of the Concordia (La.) Intelligen
car says :--During a trip ofthe last three weeks
through the Felicianas, in this State, and the
counties of Wilkenson and Adams. Mississippi,
we fottnd the crop pieviously nost promising
as we were informed, looking badly from the
long continued and severe rains-which causing
the Drop, or shedding of the forms, and sprout
ing,ofthe weed, imist naterially lessen, as it
has already greatly ijitred the crop in the vi.
cinities referred to. The worm we. are in
to med, is very destructive in Avoyelles and
Rapids.
ft is evident, from all the accounts we re
ceive, that in some parts of Louisiana the cot
ton crop must fall materially short on account
of the destruction by the caterpillar. In the
Alexandria Republican, of the 24th ult0. we find
the followipg:-.. .. .. . .
-Two weeks since we stated that thi cater
pillars had setto work in good earnest in our
cottotn fields--and we notice the result of their
habors. There is not a pla'ntation ini the parish,
as f-ar zis wle have beena able to learn, that they
have nut visited, and whlerever they ha'ie ap
peaned they have, as -usual, ,aa~de a complete
sweep of'every leaf and bud, leaving- the stalks
perfectly bare... On the plantations that were
overflowed there will be no cotton made besides
what is now opeti.;, On mnost of-the oilier pla
ces the crop will falLshort of that of last year.
The New Orleans...Bullctin of. the .4th inst.
says:--- We are informed fronm Red River that
the destruction comnmitted -by -the caterpillar is
beyond all example> ...The youtng bolls are all
eaten alf, and the fields which wvere replanted
in consequence..of the overflow in the early
part of the season, tind in which, of course, the
cotton is tter thant el-Awhere, are alanost to
tally destroyed6..,hlis is ihe e -ase, we are told,
throughout the ptarnshesof Natchitoches, Rapids
and Avoyelles. . In the -parish of St. Martin,
also, the amne pest is reported."
A Singular Fact.-Dr. Smith, who has
recently visited :th'e .Forks of the Missis
sippi, in an article on Medicine in iowa,
and other mnatters,' giveg a most singular
fact, by stating from gpod~authority, that
no person offlcially; a~espciated. with the
Indians .f-ihe Upper Mississippi, ever saw
or heard of a deaf Indian,..of one wvhose
sight was impaired~iby age, or whd~e teeth
were essentialit decayed. ,o Indian of
the Sioux tribe ever required spectacles
or discovered any advantages fcom urying,
those of travellers,: ,bea uae. theiryvisiob
w as n~ot impaired, evpo in extverie old age.
Mr, Reed nudl Mr. Doe;,tip praetical farm
ers.employed by govetnint to teseh them
agjriculture, both corjtur in declaring this
to lisftue, -*-after ai ieidence of srx years
in tbeir niidt. Onlithalmia, however is
a commonf complaint, from which they
suffer very considerably."
Anecdo.-1t will be borne in mind that
the first. powder burned in the late war
with England, was burnt on -board the
President frigate, Comn Rogers. At the
commencement of the action on board the
President frigate, a ball (an 18 lb. shot)
frpoin. the Belitidere, came over the watst
cloths~ of th'e Presideni, and sach .was. the
force of the ball that it actually cut off,
without th~i'ing thiem down, the muizzles
of several of th'e tmushete, (left there by the
marine front 6 to 8 idd~hes i0 .length-ill
ed one marine-took off the wfitst ofone
midshipman, Mr. Montgomery kilfed aii
oilier, Mr. Buck together with the quarter
gunner, and finally lodged on the deck,
and was taken below by the narrator of
this, and shown to the 3d lieutenant, Mr.
Dallas, who took it in his hand and wrote
on it with chealk.- "Cousin, I have recei
ved your present and will return it again"
-clapt it in the gun himself, and fired the
gun himself, atid fired the piece; and it-is
a remarkable fact that it actually killed
several of the officers and ina on board
the Belvidere, and finally lodged in the
cabin of that. vessel, and was-afterward
hung. in the Belviders.-cabin 'as a"Gionh
