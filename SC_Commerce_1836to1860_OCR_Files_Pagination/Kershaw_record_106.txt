Morgan now learned from his wife,
that, after the Indians had entered the
house, they found some spirits, and drank
freely ; an altercation soon took place?
one of them received a mortal stab, and
fell; his blood ran through the floor on
her. Believing it to be the blood of her
husband, she shrieked aloud, and betrayed
her place of concealment. |
She was immediately taken and bound.
The party, after setting lire to the house,
proceeded to Bryant's station. On the
day ol the battle ot the Blue Licks, a
horse, with a saddle and bridle, rushed bv
her, which jb1ic knew to be her husband's.
During the action the prisoners were left
unguarded, made their escape, and lay
concealed beneath some bushes under the
bank of the river. After the Indians had
returned from the pursuit, and left the
Dame ground, sue, with some other per-1
sons that hail escaped with her, determined
to make a search for their friends, and,
if on the field and living, to save them, if
possible, from the beasts o." prey. After
searching for some time, and almost despairing
of success, she fortunately discovered
him.
The party of Col. Logan found Morgan
and bis wife, and restored them to their
friends, their infant, and (heir home.

Times.
Luke Manning was a native of South
Carolina, and his parents are said to have
been very respectable and in affluent cir- ,
cumslances. At the a^e of 17 or IS he |
wi-, by an unfortunate fatality, lermitted ,
to select for his associates, during a period ,
of seven or eight years, a parrel of youths
of about the same aire, whose r* ckless, ,
dissipated and riotous conduct, rendered ,
tin in the terror and abhorrence of the
neighborhood they infested
One of the facts he performed during
this period, was (for his amusement only,) !
to seize an old man hy the loose skin of
his throat, d:awing the same from the (
flesh and insnrtimr hi< L.?ir? >
;-ft l" ll,?* |
wind-pipe and slitting ili<> skin, leaving a ,
large gush, or to use the peculiar slang of t
such men, 44 dew-lapped the man.'* *,
At, or about this time, (aired 425) h^ ,
came into possession of his estate, worth 1 |
about $8000, (equivalent to about $30,000 |
at the present d.iy.) He kept bachelor's |
hall, for he never married, and a gang of
his cronies always nbout him, while at the
same time, lie attempted the management j
of his estate. He hud not as yet reached ;
that degree of depravity which could ena- j
blc him to perpetrate the destruction of a ,
fellow being, but to gratify his thiist for .
blood, he calculated with cool precision, (
how much of the murderous knife that he j
constantly carried about him, he might
venture to use, without incurring the ultimate
penalty of the law. He mechanically
broke a gap-in the edge of his knife,
within an inch of the point, sufficiently
large to insert his thumb, and thus provided
against wninulinir liia #??? . r..,.

any great liability of taking life, he would
indiscriminately attack without the smallest
justifiable provocation, and cut, lucerate
and mark whoever had the misfortune t
to fall in his way, without superior rnrai)9
of defence. In this manner he left monuments
of his cruel and seemingly uncoil- <
tro'lable propensity wherever he went for
a period of five years.
During this period at a country frolic,
he amused himself by imperceptibly cutting
a lady's dress, and so completely did
he disengage and tatter it that when she
arose from her chair the shreds fell from
her body and left her exposed to the gaze
of the crowd. For this exploit he was
prosecuted and mulcted in the sum of
$5000 damages.
During the same period, he, with five of
his associates, strinnn.l ? ?.,*.? .....i >?1

his body, first with whiskey and then with
spirits of turpentine, and then set fire to
his surface. The physician that attended
upon this man, states that the skin of his
entire body was so burnt as to be disorganized
except a spot about the arms as
large as a dollar. lie entered a prosecution
against them, but they prevented it
from going into court by paying hitn $1000
each as a compromise.
At the age of thirty-two, when at a
shooting match, upon a very slight occa-(
sion, he shot a man with his rdle. For
this offence he was tried, condemned and
sentenced to be hung: through the influence
of his family, the Governor pardon-,
cd him.
About three months after this transac-'
tion he again co'mmenccd cutting and mar-|
king, which he continued for about thci
same length of time. He now attempted
to kill a man with his knife, but struck
| ihe mastiod process, and laid the "ileeh
| open lo the bone from that point to the
extremity of the chin. For thin offence
he was sentenced to twelve months imprisonment
and to pay $1000 damages.
As soon as released, he again cominen1
ced this reckless course, which he pursued
till he was thirty-eight, at which time he
killed another man. This was visited with
a conviction for manslaughter. The penalty
consisted of a fine of 81000 and 12
months imprisonment.
About forty he again committed murder
for which he was once more tried, con1
victed and sentenced to be hung. Among i
those present at the court-house, was a
brother of the prisoner, who, upon hearing
the sentence, fainted?he was removed
home and the following morning he was a
corpse. This circumstance?the lespect-,
ability of his family, and the influence of
a very respectable gentleman who was.
connected with the family by marriage, j
once more obtained his pardon from the i
Governor, oh the condition of his leaving I
the State ; for it was thought that this last i
act of mercy and a reparation from his
vicious associates, would tend to reform
him. Alas ! how vain the hope?how

very mail whose influence and exertions
had rescued him from an ignominious, (if
not an untimely) death, was the first to
feel that he was incorrigible and beyond
reform. After taking him from prison to.
his own house, before the morrow's sun
rose, the deadly rifle was in Manning's
band and aimed at his friend, relati in and
host, but who, bv seizing the rifle, pre- 1
vented him from adding another foul mur-.
der to the catalogue of his crimes.
He was, however, removed to this State i
and up to the time of his last criminal
act, a period of about three years he seemed
gloomy and melancholy, with only or- '
casional, but minor violations of the peace 1
of society. Such a state of quiet and ob- 1
scuritv, did not suit him ; and he rode to a '
gentleman's plantation, called the Over- '
seer to the fence and shot him without the (
smallest provocation. For this otlbnce he
was executed. ^
The Judge had his melancholy duty em- ^
biitered by being compelled to pronounce ;
sentence of dmttli on a man. who in bov- .
hood had been his school mate and com- j j
punion, and therefore could not moid al- . y
hiding to the past, and closed with the ex- j (
pression of a sincere hope, that the priso-1 j
tier would improve the short space of t
time allotted to him before his execution 1 ,
to fii himself for eternity. Manning, after j (
leaving the court house and while on his j j
way to prison, uttered the ost revolting !
maledictions against the Judge, saying it j
was none of his concern whether he went I (
lo lleavcn or llell. His final act was to x
snatch at a sijrk while pinioned, to strike ,
>ne of the hyestanders. He met his death ;;
with recklessness, and his expiring breath
tv.is fraught with execrations aga nst the
whole human rare. j
Manning's name is to he found upon the t
criminal docket of his n tive State, for a jt
period of twenty years. (What a com- (
nefitary upon the legal provisions of our ,
lountry for the personal safety of its cit- (
zens ! ! !) lie is said to have manifested
onsiderable address in endeavoring to in- j
luence some gentlemen in this Slate, who t
knew his family, lo petition the Governor
for a pardon In his last trial he would i
not unbosom himself oven to his counsel,
when they urged upon him the necessity of t
knowing all the facts; he put them oil by
remarking that it was enough for them to
know, that the Overseer (for the murder
>f whom he was charged,) was very tin- 1
popular with the slaves of the plantation, l
hus intimating that the slaves murdered <
him. <
Counterfeiter arrested.?Considers- '
ble excitement prevailed in this city during
last Sunday afternoon, in consequence
of the arrest of a person who was
staling at One of our principle hotels, and 1
whose manners and appearance seemed to
he those of a gentleman. This person,
whose name is N. (i. Noble, was apprehended
by police officer Burr, under the j
marge ot passing counterfeit notes of the i
Bank of the United States. On the ex- j
animation of the prisoner before Justice ,
(.'note, it was proved that be ha I passed <
three 610 counterfeit rmtes to a certain 1
person, who testified against him. The 1
prisoner, however, denied that he knew j i
tknt j li a *? ? - * c i*. j '
tiifii tin; iH'ito wui c l" IM l II11* r 1 ' 11 f HI1U S!l 11J
he had received them from another person.
*
The three counterfeit notes, which were '
proved to have been uttered by the priso- '
nor, were signed IN. Middle, President, and 1
S. Jaudon, Casltier of the Bank of the 1
United Hiatus, and Were dai< d the 7th ,'
of September, 1829, and March 8 and 14, j
1836. On searching the room which the 11
prisoner had occupied, a parcel of 121 |
$10 notes ol lite Bank of theUnted Stales, |
(some filled in and others blank,) was!
found hid under the carpet. The prison- j
er, it seems, arrived at the National Hotel
only the night before he was arrested.
He is, however, we understand, well known
in this city, having brought a large quantity
of groceries from Baltimore, and sold
trie li at auction here during the last winter.
After full examination by the magistrate,
the prisoner, being assisted by eminent j
counsel, was committed to jail for trial,'
be not being able to find the required bail
foi bis appearance at Court.
After the prisoner was lodged in jail, a
further examination of his trunk (left in
bis room at the hotel) took place on Monday
morning. The officers discovered
therein another parcel of blank counterfeit
drafts (1589 in number) of the Branch
of the Bank of the State of Alabama, at
Mongomery payable to order.
Only one of these drafts was tilled in.
It is m&(ie payable to the order of Nathaniel
Green, (the prisoner's name is, we understand,
Nathiel Green Noble,) and is
drawn upon the Merchants' Bank, New
York, for twenty-eight hundred dollars,
and it is dated Montgomery, May 24,
l?37.
We understand the prisoner is a married
man, and has a wife living in Baltimore
He was conveyed to prison in a
hack, by R. R. Burr, the officer, who deserves
much credit for the means which
he took to secure the prisoner.?Nat. Intelligencer.
The influence of Money.-?When
Philip, King of Macedon, was plotting
the subjugation of Athens by the use ofj
money, after the use uf his arms had pro-I
veil unavailing, a certain orator was called i
upon to address the people in opposition
to Philip, but declined on the ground of
his being too hoarse to speak, whereupon
a person in the assembly alledged that his
throat had been affected with Philip's money.
We have seen something of the
same kind in our country. Men who were
once strenuous opponents of a National
Bank and denounced it as strongly as the
Athenian orator ever denounced the King
of Macedon, have since becan.e its warm
and persevering advocates. A number of
them could be named, among whom Mr.
Webster stands pre-eminent. Whether
or not they have been operated upon by
the money of the Bank we leave our readers
to judge and decide for themselves.
If such he the case, the money of the
Bank would seem to have had a more
powerful effect than that of Philip ; for
the latter only prevented the Athenian
orator from speaking against Philip, but
Lhnl of the B ink has caused those who
formerly denounced it, to he loud in their
iipplause and support of it. Such is the
> fleet which money will sometimes proluce.

The Board of Directors of the Louisia*

the following noles.

the suspended banks is about to resume
specie payments forthwith, and we con- i
grululate the directors on the bol l step
they have taken, as it will further lend to re- I
duce the waning premium on the mctalic.i
currency. Although this is the lirst regit- j i
lar announcement of resumption, it is n<?t
by any means the only instance of a bank i
paying gold and silver since the stoppage, <
as several of otir moiiied institutions have <
been nartiullv doimr ?=<? c '

days. Our readers may now expect with- i
in a short lime to see the metalic medium <
at its proper value, fur independent of <
the decline which it has experienced a <
mongsl ourselvi s, owing as well to the l
supply continually flowing in from abroad \
as to the facilities in the way of small buy- 1
tug and selling likely to accrue from the i
municipal issues, and the want of which i
indeed tended materially to c hance the ;
value of coinage, in New York it is also (
looking down, by reason of * In? demand ,
for exportation having in a g eat mea- <
sure ceased. This lack of uemand in \
the latter place is maiulv attributed to \
the gigantic exertions of Riddle, who \
has been forwarding cotton to an imnn use &
amount to no-el the engagement of the!
U. JStntes Rank in ICurope, thereby sup-11
porting the credit of the institution, whilst'?
retaining the specie in the country. The l1
power amiability displayed by this abb? ti-, 1
nancier in steering through the dillieultics | I
of latter times, must command for him I
the admiration even of inveterate oppn- j.
oents. There appears to b<- no doubt
that he will resume specie payments tin- ?
mediately, which he may do with the ut c
most confidence, as there are very few, t
with the exception it may he ol some of <
the agricultural population, who wilt ask \
Lo turn the paper of the U. S. Bank inlojr
gold or silver, unmoasurably more desi-j |
rablc than either of which, as it mrtnmlv! ?
is for business transactions. r
We feel ronfi ent ihe same remarks I
ivill be Toond equally applicable to the c
Louisiana State Bunk, as well as several
other of our monied institutions, which r
only were induced to join in the suspen* i
sion as a conservative measure to the whole ;
comrminiiy, at ;i time wlmu a general pa- ,
nic wat abroad, which needed some such \
decisive measure as a panacea to the dis- ;
astrous consequences with which it "wasl(
pregnant. On the same grounds did the's
batiks of Baltimore and Philadelphia sus- j
petul, with the exception, as well as our
recollection serve? us, that in both the |
latter placet they were induced to do so by t
a public call oi the citizens, without any t
previously formed resolution of their own t
ort the subject. i
New Orleans, July 21. c
By the arrival of the brig Kinurlcader |
and schooner Levin Jones, yesterday from s
Tumpieo, which place they left on the j
12th inst. we learn that since the defeat of i
Moctezwma, nothing jf the slightest importance
line! occurred in that port. Kvc- t
ry tiling remained quiet till time of their (
departure, with every prospect of remain- |
ing so. The immense Conducta, so long ^
spoken of, amounting to two millions of ?
dollars, or something between two and \
three hundred mule loads nf silver, a great. \
part of which is destined for this port,U
was expected to arrive on the 14th, two *
days alter the departure of the vessels. 1
By the Ringleader and Levin Jones, it"
less a sum than one hundred anil eiuhtv- .
- *e ?J *
seven thousand dollars in specie have been [
received by different bouses in this city,
so that at I ngtb, there is every likelihood s
of all desirous of the " silver," getting |
their fill of it. Of this immense amount j
of precious metal, one hundred and twrn ?
ty-five thousand two hundred dollars came i1
to the house of Lizardi. I
It is little to he wondered at that the t
continued flowing in of such large amounb |
of the " desired/* is at length beginning ,
to bring it to its natural standard; and, j
consequently, the highest that we hear ?
quoted just now, except by those
diotely interested in the price of the article,
is ten per cent premium. We have
heard of sales at a much lower one, all
which go to prove that the day of panic
is passed, and that the public mind is fast
returning to that wholesome tone which
will fit it for a calm and dispassionate examination
of the really objectionable feature
which may exist in our present monetary
system?a task to which it was
naturally incompetent while swayed by
eveiy alarming doctrine, broached cither
by those utterly incompetent to discuss so
abstruse a subject, or by others who desired
nothing better than to witness things
at tht ir very worst, though, perhaps, a
mistaken notion that from hcncc might
arise a whblesomcr state of things. As
an additional proof of the increasing stability
of the public mind, we may mention
the instance of a sale of household property
a few days since in the Arcade Exchange,
which brought at public auction a
price amounting to within ten per cent of
that which it sold at within twelve months
since, when such investments were at a
very high value. Yet another. As far
as we can hear, the demand for specie at
those hanks paviny it. is of a v<?rr mmnr
character. The truth is, the Municipality
issues, by rendering small buying and selling,
a matter of no difficulty, are 'working
most favorably.

Genti.rmkn:? The uiierest which you
ha<e ever taken in the prosperity of this
country, and your exertions with many %
others to sustain I er through the oppressive
war, induces n.c to b lieve that, every
circumstance, tending to promote the prospt-ri'y
of our country, or in any way calculated
to illustrate her advantage, will
oraiily you. I take pleasure in stating that,
the recent vo;. agt s made from your city to
this country by steamboats, proves beyond a
doubt, that steam navigation is safe, and
vviil be prosecuted with profit to the courttry
and those who embark in it. The gale
>f wind on the evening of the 23d ult. was
iiio of the most severe that occurs on this
soast ; the steamer Orleans, 13iough master,
though not intended for a sea boat, having
finitely too much top. was out at sea
luring the? >tOrui. ami rod? ihrnmrh i? with
jMt sustain ng ni< cli i j ry. You can
form son.e idea of the violence of the gale,
vlien iwo anchors would dot hold the boat
ivitlioot the assistance of a tremendous
ron slnft, which was let down with a five
nch cable of sixty fathoms, ami which,
ifter the stonn, could not he raised in
:onsequence of its weight, and was cut
iway; this event speaks much as to the
ntire successs of steamboat navigation to
his eouotry, and shews to t, that the Orleans
vas built wheo streu?tli and durability
vere considered essential requisites in a
iteamb - it.
The steamer Convoy arrived here on
lie 2'I inst. discharged part of her cargo,
ind is now on her wey to the Brazos and
llatngorda. These boats are too large to
>e profi able to their owners for the present
Hisiiiess, but >o so <n as (nil freight can he
utd, proprietors will doubtless realize a
real pro.it.
The entrance to this harbour is perfectly
afe, twelve feet being found on the Car, ct
iou.niou singes of the tide, and for some
ime past 13 or I I feet. I believe the
Means came over with the latter depth of
vater. The many wrecks that have occure
I 011 this const may be attributed to careessness
or ignorance, which the better
irrangcment of pilotage will correct. The

iccoiitplish which, the rul s and reuulatious

'1 he litt'c attention which has hitherto
