VEGETABLE PAtTAGBA.
THE subscrifter informs the public, that he has
just completed tho mixture of this valuable medicine.
He takes pleasure in stating that he has
made use of this PANACEA, successfully in a case
of Scrofula, which be has been afflicted with more
than tubes years. On several occasions he applied
to practical Physicians for aid, (North and South,)
and received no benefit. He was, at length, prevailed
upon by numerous acquaintances, to try the
virtue of certain ROOTS and HERBS; and believing,
that the Receipt would greatly benofit him,
he took it, together with an old French Receipt: from
which is manufactured the VEGETABLE PANACEA.
It is proper hero to say, that the quality of some,
or At>T< the principal Roots, aro well known to the
\fni1 innl Pnrnlfu kir tvltAm fkntt nm nnntln noo<I
For Scrofula or King's Evil Ulcerated Sores,
general diseases of the BLOOD, or the effects of
Mercury ; it has a decided salutary effect.
For Bowel. Complaint he would also recommend
the use of the VEGETABLE PANACEA. Children
are frequently attacked with this complaint:
especially when teething. A few doses ol the PANACEA
will check the Bowels, and they become regular
again. It has been tried by a great number of
respectable individuals, and pronounced a "certain
cure." He has tried it at different times in his own
family, and it relieved the child immediately.
This Medicine is simple in its operations; and has t
a pleasar.t taste. |
Give it a trial, and judge its worth.
The subscriber will keep a constant supply of the
Panacea at the differenr Drug Stores throughout
the United States. Orders addressed to the suhscribi-r,
or to James R. M'Kain, will be promptly attended
to. The PANACEA may always bo had at

PREPARED BY I
F. S. BRONSON. J
IT is with great pleasure the subscriber informs /
the public rhat he has completed the mixture ol
he VEGETABLE ELIXIR. This medicine is t
composed of Roots which grow in this State. It is |
jscless to enter into a detail of the value of this Melicine,
(or any other Root medicine,) as it is well
known that all Roots have valuable Medical properties.
He would also state that there is not the
least danger in the use of the Elixir. For the following
named diseases, there is no medicine made or
vended at the present tiino, better calculated to relieve
the afflicted, than tho Vegetable Elixir. ,
For Rheumatism and Consumption, the Elixir
should be used internally and externally.
For Dyspepsia or Dysury, he would also recom- ]
mend the mo of the Elixir, as he feels confident
it will prove highly beneficial to those who use it.
Tn Ihrton vvhit nrn nOlolo/l wifK Piictnlna
Distempers, and Venereal diseases, he particularly
recommends the uso of the VEGETABLE ELIXIR.
Without the fear of contradiction, he recommends this
Medicine as the best now in use?as it has proved
successful in every case in which it has been used.
Orders addressed to the subscriber or Mr. J. R.
M'Kain, will be promptly attended to. The Emxir
may always be had at J. R. M'Kain's Drug Store.

THE success of the SOUTHERN TONIC is
unprecedented. It has been anxiously sought
after by all persons in every part of the United
States, and its widely extended distribution has
been owing to the many requests received from
every section of the South and South West. Although
it originated in an obscure pi.rt of the country
but a few years since, it is nowTfound in all the
principal towns and villages in the Union, and its
virtues as a cure for Ague and Fever, and as a
general Tonic, are appreciated by all who have
used it Being as it professes a compound of
Southern Vegetables, it is needless to offer the assurance
that there is no Arsenic,Mercury, nor any
thing in the least hurtful to the human constitution
in it. It will be found a valuable Medicine
in all cases of Dyspepsia and disorganised Stomach
and Bowelsl and patients convalescing from Billious
Fever, will derive the most important benefits
from the use of the Southern Tonic. It may
be administered to children and infants of the most
tender age with the utmost safety. Prepared by

PATENT COTTON OIN. ]
11x HIS Gin can be made double, or single. If f
.1 made double, they reduce labor, and gin just I
double, the quantity of cotton over the single cy lin- ,
der Gin, no other knd having been in use prevous .
to this patent; and whether single or double, they <
are found to improve the quality of the cotton, by '
more perfectly cleaning it. They can be made to
contain from 20 to 100 saws in a stand, and whether
small or large, one hand will be sufficient to attend
them. The Gins have mechanical feeders and
hoppers attached to them, which free the cotton
trom leaves, trash, dirt, &c. before it can teach the
sawn, and by the thorough hackling operation it
receives from the feeders twliiel. mni/? 4
7 " M,w" tfVU ICVU* |
lulions to one of the saws, it is almost in a half
gined state, before it descends to the saw By a
very simple arrangement of a screw to each set of
gaates, on which the hoppers rest, and through
which the teeth of the feeders pass, they can be
made to teed slow or fast to suit the condition of
the cotton at the time. When made double, the
saws are placed on two sets of cylinders and turn
upon each other in opposite directions, and are
cleansed by two sets of brushes that have fourrevolutions
to one of twe saw. The two cylinders can
be detached so as to enable the planter to run one
or both at pleasure, although embraced with feeders,
Ac. in one stand. The whole is put in operation
with a drum and band, as in the ordinary Gin, and
may be propelled by horse, steam, or water power.
It may also be propelled by iron running gear.
The force required to work it, is about the same as
that necessary to move on equal number of saws in
the common Gin. This Gin lias been put in
operation in New Orleans for two or three weeks,
and its success tested in the presence of a large
number of planters, merchants and others, and
received their general approbation
Several gentlemen have been so kind as to give
the Patentee theif written opinion tespecting the
merits of the Gin. A number of others could be
added, but the following are deemed sufficient:
From his Excellency Gov. White of Louisiana.
New Orleans, Feb. 27, 1837.
Dr. A. Jones?Sir, In reply to your enquiry,
what I think of your improved Cotton Gin, 1 have
to say, thnt 1 saw it work on Saturday the 2T>lh inst.
and was very much pleased with its performance.
The mere fact of its Belf-feeding, seems to me to j
be a very valuable improvement; and besides, the
quality of the cotton, as it comes out of the pro- r
cess, appeared to me to be better and cleaner tnan 1
from the common Gins in use, and that it saves 0
considerably in labor. Respectfully, &c. f
E. D. WHITE. ]
From Mr J. Complon, a wealthy planter, resident d
in the Parish of Rapide, Louisiana. ?
Dr. Jones?Dear Sir, I have examined yonr Pa- a
lent Cotton Gin, with feeders, Ac. And have P.
seen it in operation, and approve of it so highly, *'
that I have taken the liberty of ordering one for P
my plantation in time for the next crop. 11
