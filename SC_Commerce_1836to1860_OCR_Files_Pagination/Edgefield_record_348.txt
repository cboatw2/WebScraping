SPEECH OF MR. CALHOUN.
Of South Carolina, On the Report of Mft.
Grundy, of Tenne ssee, in relation to the
Assunption of the Debts of the States by
the Federal Government.-U. States
Senate.
February 5, 1840.
MR.. CALHOUN said :-When I have
heard it asserted again and again, in ibis
discussion, that this report wits uncalled
for; that there was no one in favor of the
assumption ofState debts, and that the
resolutions were mere idle, abstract nega
tives, of no sort uf importaned, I could not
hut ask nyself, if all this he so,- why this
deep excitement ? why this ent zeal to
make collateral issues 7 -and, above all,
why the great anxiety to avuid a direct
vote on the reelutions ? To these inqui
ries I could find but one solution; and that
is, disguise it as you may, there is, in re
ality, at-the bottom, a deep and agitating
question. Yes, there is such. a question.
The scheme of assuming the debts of the
States is no idle fiction. The evidence of
its reality, and that it is now in agitation
burst from every quarter, within and with
out these walls, on this side and the other
side of the Atlantic; not, indeed, a direct
assumption, for that would be too absurd;
and harmless, because too absurd; but in
a form far more plausihle and danigerous
-an assumption, in efect, by dividing the
proceeds of the sales of the public lands
among the States.
I shall not stop to show that such dis
tribution, under existing circunsiances,
with the deeps indebtedness and embar
rassment of many of the States; would be,
in reality, an assumption. We all know.
that without such indebtedness andl em
barrassment, the scheme of distribution
would not have the least chance for adop-.
tion, and that it would he perfectly harm
less, and cause no excitement; but plunged,
as the States are in debt; it becomeg a
question truly formidable, and on which
the future politics of the country are des
tined for years to turn. '-If. then, the
schme should lie adopted,.it must lie by
the votes of the itrdebted S:aWes, in order to
aid their credit, and lighten 'their burden:
and who is so blind as not to see that it
would be in truth, what I have asserted it
to be in effect, to that extent, an assump
tion of their debts?
Here, then, we have the real queslion at
issue, which has caused all this exciteient
and zeal-a question pregnant with the
most important consequences. immediate
and remote. What I now prophse is; to
trace rapidly and briefly some of the more
prominent whieh would result from this
srheme, should it ever become a law.
The first, ant most .immediate, would
be to substract from the Treaury- a sum
equal to the annual proceeds of the sales
of the public lands. I do not intend to ex
amine the constitutional question whether
Congress has or las not the right to make
the substraction, and to divide the proceeds
among the States. It is not necessary.
The committee has conclusively shon
that it has no such power; that it holds the
public donaini in trust for the States in
their Federal capacity as members of the
Union, in aid of their contribution to the
Treasury; and that to denationalize the
fund, (if! may use the expression,) by
distributing it among the States for their
separateand individual uses, would be a
manifest violation of the trust, and wholly
unwarranted by the Constitution. Pas
sing. then, by the constitutional question,
I intend to restrict my inquiry to what
would he its fiscal and money effects.
Thus regarded, the first effect of the
subtraction would be to cause an equal de
ficit in ths revenue. I need not inform
the Senate, that there is not i surplus cent
in the Treasury; that the most rigid econ
omy will be necessary to meet the de
mandson it during the current year; that
the revenue, so far frotm hbeing 0n the in
crease, must be rapidly reduced, under
extsaing laws, in the next t wo years; andI
that every dollar withdrawt, by subistrac
aing the proceeds of the public lands, must
make a corresponditng dfeir. We are
thus brought to the qtuestion, what would
be the probable annual amount of the die
ficit. andI how is it to be supplied?/
The receipts from the sales of the pub
l'e lands, I would suppose, mzay he safely
estimated at five milliotns of dlollars at
least, on an average, for the next ten or
fifteena years. They were about six tail
litons the last year. The first three quar
ters gave within a fraction of five and a
half millions. The estimate for this year,
is three anti a half millions ; making the
average of the two years hut little short of
five millions.
If, wit h these data, wve cast our eyes back
ont the last ten or fifteen years, ~we shall
come to the cotnclusion, ta king into consi
erat ion our great increase of poptulation
and wealth, and the vast quantity of pub
lic land held by the government, that the
average [ have estim-ated is not too high.
Assuminig, then, that the deficit wvould be
five millions, the n.,xt inaquiry is, how shall
it be supplied? There is but one way; a
corresponding increase of the duties on
imports. We have no other source of re
ventue buat the Post Office. No otne would
think of layinag it on that, or to. raise the
amount by internal taxes. The resualt,
thetn, thus far, would he to withdraw from
the Treasury five millions of the proceeds
ofthe sale. of the public lands, to he die
tributed among the States, and to impose
an equal amoutut of duty on imports, to
make good the deficit. Now 1 would ask
what is the difference, regarded as a fiscal
transaction, between withdrawing that a
mount for distribution, and imposing a simt.
ilar amount of duties on the insports, to sup.4
ply its nlace and ,that of laving the pro.
ceeds of the sales of the land in the Treas
ury, and imposing an equal amount of du
ties for distribution? It is clearly the same
thing, in eflet, to retain the proceeds of
the publie lands in the Treasury and tn im
pose the duties for distribution, or to distri
bute the proceeds and thereby force the
imposillon or the duties to supply the place.
It is, then, in reality, a scheme to im
pose five millions of additional duties on
the importations of the country, to lie dis
tributed among the States: and I now ask
where is the Senator who will openly a
vow himself an advocate of such a scheme?
I put the question home, soletnuly, to those
on the opposite side, do you not believe
that such a scheme would be unconstttu
tional, unequal, unjust, and dangerous?
And can you, as hottest men, do that in
effect, by indirect means, which, if done
directly, would be clearly liable to every
one of those objectious?
I have said such would be the case, Te
gtrded as a fiscal transaction. In a polit
ical point of view, the distribution of the
sales of the land would be the worst of the
two. Tt would create opposing and hos
tile relaiions between the old and new
States, in reference to the public domain.
Heretofore, the conduct of the Govern
ment has been distingtished by the great
est libierality, tint to say grenerally. towards
the new States, in the administration of
the public lands. Adopt this scheme, and
its coduct will he the reverse. Whutev
er might he granted to them. would sub
tract atn eqllal amount from the sum to be
distributed. An austere and rigid adtnin
istration would be the result, followed by
hostile feelings ou both sides, that would
accelerate the conflict between them in
reference to the public domain-a conflict,
advancing but too fast by the natural course
of eventis, and which, any one in the least
gifted with foresight, must see, come when
it will,.would shake the Union to the cen
tre, unless prevented by wise and timely
concession.
Having shown that the scheme is, in
effect, to imipose dtties for distribution, the
next question is, on whom will they fall?
I know thut there is a great diversity of
pinion, as to who, in fact, pays the duties
on imports. I do tnt intend to discuss
that point. We of the staple and expor
ting States have long settled -the question.
for ourselves, almost unanimons, from sad
experience. We know how ruinously
high duties fell on us-how they desolated
our.cities, and exhausted our section. We
also know how rapidly we have been re
covering as they have been roing ol, in
spite of all the difficulties of the times,
and the distracted and disordered state of
the currency. It is now a fixed maxim
gadh its, that there is not a whit of difier
ence, as far as we are concerned, be
tween an export and import duty-between
iween paying toll going otw, or returning
in-or going down to market, or returning
back. If this be true, of which we have
no doubt, it is a point of no little impor
tance to us of the staple States to know
what portion of the duties will fall to our
lot to pay. We furnish about three-fourl hs
of the exports, with about two-fifths of the
whole population. Four-fifths of five nil
lions is four millions, which would be the
measure of ur contribu!ion, and two-fiflis
of five millions is two millions,which would
be our share of the distribtiion; that is to
say, for every two dollars we would re
ceive, under this notable scheme, we would
pay four dollars to thie fund from which it
would be derived.
I now ask, what does it amount to, but
makitng the income of the States to the a
mount of five millions annually, common
property, to be distributed among them
according to numbers, or some such ratio,
wit hout the least reference to their respec
tive contribution? And what is that btt
rank agrarianism-agrarianisma among the
States? To divide the annual income is
as ntuch agrarianism as to divide proper
ty iuself; and wvould lie as much so divided
among twenty-six States, as among twen
ty-six individuals. Let me -admonish the
tmembers oppiosite, if they really appre
fend the spirit of agranatnism as munch
as maight be inferred from their frequent
declarations, tnot to set the fatail example
here, in their legislative, capacity. Re
member there is but one step between di
viding the income of the States, and that
of individuals, and between a partial and
general distribution.
Proceeding a step further in tracing
consequences. anot he.- question presents
itself-on what articles shall the duties he
laid ? On the free or the dutied articles?
Shall they be laid for revenue or for pro -
tection? Is it not obvious that so large an
amount as five millions, equal to one-third
of the present income from that source,
and probably not much less than one-half
what it will be at the end of two years,
cannot be raised without rotusing from its
slumber the tanfiquestion, with all its dis
traction and danger? Should that, how
ever,not be the ease; there is another con
sequence connected with this, that cannot
fail to rouse it, as 1 shall now proceed to
explain.
The act of distributing the sales of the
public lands, imng the- States, of itself,
as well as the amnount to he distributed,
will do much to resuscittate their credit. It
s the dosired result, and the leading mo
ive for the act. Five millions annually,
the amount assumed,) ou a pledge of thme
public domain, would, of itself, be a suffi
:ient basis for a loan of ninety or an hun
lred aiillions of dollars, ifjudiciously man
majed. But suppose that only one halt
uhould be applied, as the means of negotia
ing loans abroad, in order to complete the
ild,or to commence new, worksofimprove
tint. or other objects,.1 ask, what would'
be the effect on our imports, of negonting
a loan in 'England, or elsewhere in Eu
iope, of forty or fifty millions, in the course
or the-next year or two ? Can any doubt,
from pit experience? We all know the
process. Very little gold or silver is ever
seen in these negotiations. A credit is-ob
tained, and that placed in bank there, or
with wealthy bankers. Bills are drawn
otn this country, and then sold to merchants.
These are transmitted to Europe. and the
proceeds returned in goods. swelling the
tide of imports in proportion to the amount.
The crash of our -manufacturers folfow,
and that in turn, by denunciations against
over-importing'and over-trading. in which
those who have been most active'iu caus
ing it are sure to join, but will tace special
care to make not the least allusion to the
real source whence it flows. Is not that
the case at this moment? And can it he
doubted, that with the increase of the

of the systeii would demand its renewal.
If to this we add, that, tinder the compro.
mise act, the tariff must be revived and
remoddled, who can look at such a con
currence of powerful causes without see.
ing thnt it would he almost impossible to
prevent the revival of the protective sys
tem, should the qcheme of distribution be
adopted ? I hazard nothing in asserting
that the renewal wouh[ certainly follow,
and, as this would be' one of the most prom
inent and durable conserlnences of that
scheme, I propose to consider it fully, in
its most important hearings.
One of the most striking features of the
system is its tendency to increase. Let i
lie but once recognized, and let the most
moderate duties be laid for protection;
but pit the system in motion, and its course
would be onward, onward, by an irresisti
ble impulse, as I shall presently show,
from past experience; and hence - the
necessity of vigilance, and a determin
ed resistance to every courseof policy that
may by possibility lead to its renewal.
This tendency to increase, results from
causes inherent sni inseparable from the
system, and las evinced itselflby the fact,
that every tariff for protectbon has invaiia
bly disappointed its frinds in the protec
tion anticipated, and has been followed
periodically, after short intervals, bj a de
mand for another tariff with increased du
ties, to afford the protection vainly antici
pated from its predecessor. Such has
been the result throughnut, from 1816 to
1828, when the first and last protective
tariffs were laid, which I propose to shtov
by a very brief historical sketch of the rise
and progress of the system.
The late wag, with the embargo and
other restrictive measures that preceded
it, almost expelled our commerce from
the ocean, and diverted a vast amount of
capital, that had been employed in'it, to
manufactures. Such was the cause that
led io the system. After the termination of
the war, there waq on the part of Congress
and the country, the kindest feeling tow ardo
the manufiacturiig interest, accomain'ied
by a strong desire so to adjust the duties,
(indispensable to meet the expenses of
Government, and to pay the public debt,)
as to afford them ample protection. The
mnanufacurers were consulted, and the
act of 'J1 was moddled to their wishes.
rThey regarded it as affording snflicient
and permanent protection, and I, in my
then want of experience as to the nature
of the system, did not dream that we
woult hear any more of the tarifl, till it
would become necessary to readjust the
duties, after the discharge of the Iubic
debt. Vainexpectation. Twovearshad

or still returned, till 1624, when the tariff
of that year passed, which was believed
on all sides to be ample, atid was consid
eredl, like that of '16, to be a final adjust
ments of thme question. It was under this
impression that the South acquiesced (re
luctantly) in t?'e very high duties it im
posed. The late General Hayne, then a
distinguished member of this body, took a
very active part against it; and I well re-,

oppreisive, it woutld lie the last. H is ex
