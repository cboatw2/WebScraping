COt'RACK BETTER THAN CONCEALMENT.
Fanny and I were the youngest children, so we i
were never allowed the privileged boon of sitting j
up; but certainly, soon after sunset in summer I
months, we must bid good [night to papa and |
manuna, and brothers and sisters, and go up stairs i
to bed. I used occasionally to rebel; but Fanny j
went so quietly, and indeed sleepily away, that it ;
was no agreeable thing to urge my claims alone.
" There, see Fanny, she never makes any difficulty !
about it,' was the unanswerable argument always
presented to 6ubdue me.
\\ c said our prayers, and in five minute6 Fanny
was fast asleep. I always sat up longer, and as
6oon as my sister was comfortably in bed, used to
take my scat at the open window, delighted with
the sunset, the stars, the clouds, the trees, and
most of all, with the fire-flics that tenanted a little
green field, that lay beside our house. For an
hour at a time, have I watched them, dancing,
and soaring, and disappearing, sometimes here,
sometimes there, sparkling on the ground or
flaunting in the air; they were to mc a wonder
and a beauty, and I trace my earliest interest in
natural history to the changeful light of the little J
firc-fly.
One evening, I was bent upon catching one.?
They seemed to fly higher, and to approach near- I
cr my window. How many times I darted out
iny hand, unsuccessfully, to the great danger of
precipitating myself out of the window, I cannot
tell ; but at length I found myself in possession of
a fire-fly. I was slightly disappointed to find it i
nothing, but a little black bug; and concluding I i
was mistaken, was just ready to let it go, when i
the fire gleamed out from his darkened body, and j
changed my mind. To retain him in my hand j
was to deprive myself of his radiance ; to let him j
fly away, was not to be thought of; and to call i
my sister, or mother, or Ruth, to bring me a turn- j
bier to put him under, would be drawing down i
ujion myself the rebuke of-bcing a 44 very naughty
girl for being up so lateand what was still
harder to bear, a reference to my sister Fanny.?
But the fire-fly must be kept at all hazards; and I ,
sat down again by the window, to wonder how I
should keep him. To imprison him in my bag,
drawer, or closet did not s.cm very feasible.? ;
44 Oh, that 1 had a tumbler !" I inwardly ex- |
claimed; and a tumbler I resolved to have.
I could creep down the front stairs, into the
parlor, and into the parlor closet, too, without any I
body's knowing it?I knew I could?and thus j
secure the very thing I wanted. 1 was sometime I
executing my project. At every step, I halted, !
to be assured 1 was not heard?then the creaking
of my own steps upon the stairs made mc start;
and then I had to feci my way, for the starlight of
the firc-fly could not aid mc. Success attended
my efforts, and I returned to my chamber with a
gla-s goblet, under which my prisoner was duly j
ushered, and then he flared and flickered at my i
pleasure.
I thought to awaken Fanny; but she might
make unpleasant inquiries, and so I let her sleep
on. " How much better tliis goblet is than a j
tumbler," I thought ; 44 and it's what mamma !
would never have let me taken. Oh, I must be !
so careful of it!" And at that moment, just as I i
was making some untoward movement, I acci- I
dentally pushed the gublet from the table. It fell 1
?it broke?and the fire-fly flew away.
"What a reversion of feeling ! From the greatest
exultation, to direst wo. 44 What shall I do ?"
I exclaimed aloud. The flv could be replaced,
but the goblet?one of njannna'6 beautiful eut
ghss goblets which were never used but on thanksgiringday,
or when some very particular person
apj?earcd at the dinner table 1?one of the goblets
which adorned mamma's china closet! Oh, it
must be so quickly missed, and so much lamented
!
My first thought after the disaster, was to learn
if any person in the house was disturbed by the
noise. Fanny was still sleeping, and as no one
came up to our room, it soon became evident that
no one had been disturbed. 44 But what shall I
do ?" I asked myself again and again, as I sat
down on the floor to collect the scattered fragments.
The goblet was broken into four pieces,
'i T 1
and so could not be boiled togciner, as x witw
mamma had sometimes done with broken china.
My first impulse, and my best one, was to arise
and go right down to mamma, and tell her all
about the whole affair ; but I had not courage to
do it. 44 Mamma must know it; and the sooner
the better," 6aid duty.
44 Perliaps she'll never know it!" whispered
fear.
44 Bui she must?she will !" persisted duty.
"Nobody knows it but you. Can't you keep a
secret ?" said fear. 44 She will reprove and frown
?and your brothers and sisters! what will they
s iy ?"
How I did long to go ; I knew that mamma
would approve my honesty ; that she would be
sorry, indeed, but that she would not frown, or
say one word worse than I could say, or think
myself, about it. Almost in spite of my better
judgment, my fears prevailed?and there I sat, I
hardly know how long, thinking what precautions
were necessary to keep my secret. I went to the
window to throw out the glass fragments?but
surely the morning light must discover them,
.L .1 J.-..I : ; ,.?H k.. ny.rln
and men trie ua-auim nuUi?
41 who did it ?" It made mc tremble to think ol"
it!
I was afraid to keep the pieces in my room all
ni^ht, lest somebody rhould discover them before
I was up. At length, with a degree of firmness
worthy of a better cause, I resolved to steal down
the back stairs, into the biek yard, and throw the
glass under the barn. With slow and cautious
steps I descended the stairs, into the pantry ;
there I peeped through the crack of the door, and
saw mamma standing at the kitchen table, with
several of the children about her. They were
t.Iking very fast, and mamma was smiling, and
they all looked as happy as could be.
In the meantime, I vas standing there in my
bare feet, with my little cotton night-gown on,
holding fuet the broken glass until it cut my hand.
Then I wished I could rush to mamma, and tell
her all al?out it! Then I envied the happiness of
the children! " Oh, I shall never be happy
again," I exclaimed. Then I tu n d a way with
a bitfer heart to trcaJ the dewy ground, down to
the bam ; and tiicrc I threw away the broken
goblet. When it was out of my hand, my heart
was slightly relieved ; and I returned undisturbed
to my chamber. Then, when I laid down by Fan.
ny's side, how I did wish I were sleeping as
sweetly as my innocent sister, with nothing to
disturb me.
But I could not go to skep. I torsed about upon
the bed, and smoothed my pillow, and fixed the
c'othcs, and drew closer to Fanny; but it was a
long time before I could rest; for just as I was i
dropping into a slumber, I would start up sudden- ;
ly, and frightened. i
Night went by, and a bright morning came.? j
As I awoke I felt a sense of oppression, and as I i
rubbed my eyes, there came clearly and distinctly
into my mind what had hapj>enod ; and what J
must be done, I asked myself, when mamma ;
would miss the goblet ? The broken goblet haun- (
ted nic all day. I looked anxiously at mamma at j
breakfast, to ascertain whether she had discovered
her loss. If somebody suddenly came into tho
room, I fancied the deception was to be exposed.
* ? ?1 ' T ... if ii-linn I rr??rhed home.
."XI St'IlWl JL MUlluutu At, nin.il . t
they would be talking about it; at play, the im- j
age of the broken goblet repressed my mirth, and I !
went around uneasy and unquiet, bearing about
me a troubled heart. Thus did I suffer days of
anxiety from fear of discovery, when an open confession
to mamma would in an instant have relieved
me, and restored peace to my spirit.
The time at length arrived, which I so much
dreaded, when the goblet was missed. It was not
to be fouiid?nobody had seen it?nobody had
taken it. It was in the best china closet, and nobody
ever went there. Where could it be ? "I
cannot believe it is broken," said mamma. Had
it been sent any where ??nobody remembered
such an event?nobody had used it. Ruth de.
clared it was the strangest thing in the world,
| where it rouid be ; and Ruth was so zealous for
| mamma's interest that I trembled, when I considi
ered what a searching she would now make.
The children were all duly qucsiioncd?all but
me. I contrived to escape, or rather mamma askj
ed me, just as I was going out of the room, and I
pretended not to hear her. It did seeni to me
there never was such a talk about a missing article
before. The longer I kept my secret the more
I feared detection, and the more wretched did 1
feel.
" If I only knew what had become of it," said
mamma, u I should care less. Somebody knows
where it is. It is used too little, and valued too
much for any one to forget about it." I know I
turned pale, and I am riitc I trembled.
It was, perhaps, some three weeks after the
| disaster, when, as I rushed into the kitchen, with
j a hop, skip, and jump, after school, noisily demand,
j ing something to eat, what should I sec upon the
table, but four of the pieces of the broken goblet ;
yes, all four discovered and taken out from undi r
the barn, by the indefatigable Ruth. 44 What
shall I do ?" I inwardly exclaimed. 44 Oh, I
wisix I was in the sea?I wish I was dead?I wish
I was anywhere!" and 1 now ran into the garden,
afraid of everj* body, and afraid of myself.
44 Oil, how much worse it is to tell her now,
than it would have been at first!" was my bitter
reflection. It seemed to me that escape was impossible,
I knew that mamma would find out, and
i now imagined that she greatly suspected some
of us. 44 If I could only be sick, and go to bed,"
thought I, 44 and I am sure I feel sick."
When the dinner-bell rang, I had no heart to
meet the tacts oi the luinuy, or 10 cai a uiuuuuui,
hunger instantly disappeared as soon as I saw the
broken goblet. To dinner, I would not go, so I
went back to the school, and spent the noon, and
a long and disagreeable noon it wa6, too. 44 How
happy they are at home," thought I; and I felt
j that 1 was an outcast, a self-made out-cast. This
j made my tears none the less bitter.
I contrived so to dispose of my person that
' Fanny should not see me, until the bell rang for
school to begin, and then there would be no time
i for inquiry. Ileart-s'ck and with a severe headache,
I really did feel quite too unwell to remain
in school, and long before five o'clock, asked the
teacher to let me go home ; and my pale countc.
nance aided iny request. With slow steps I went
homeward, and I do not think 1 was ever more
wretched in my life.
When I entered the house, mamrna heard my
: strps and called me to her. 44 My dear what is
\ the matter ? Where have you been ? How pale j
you look." And she put her ann around me, and j
: took off my bonnet. Fortunately, she wag alone. I
I buret into tears, and hid my face in her lap. She
j gently stroked my hair, and again asked44 what
i was the matter with her little daughter ?"
44 Oh, mamma, it was I! it was 1 who broke !
' the goblet!" I exclaimed, in my bitterness of j
| heart. As soon as I uttered the words, the dread- )
I ful burden which I had borne about me for so j
! long a time, was removed. Then I told her all. j
I I was penitent and humbled, indeed ; but the I
I great wall of partition which separated me from j
; every body else, was broken down ; and while I J
I sobl)ed in mamma's lap, I felt drawn towards her, I
1 and I knew she would pity and sympathise with i
! me, although she could not approve of my con- j
i duct.
' 44 My child," said mamma, after sonic time, i
!44 you have made yourself a great deal of sorrow j
j and trouble, for a very little cause ; at least so far j
i as the breaking of the goblet has any thing to do
! with it. What you have failed in is moral cour'
age ; had you come honestly and openly that very
night, or the next morning, and told all about it,
j how much anxiety and misery you would have
saved yourself."
Mamma said a great deal more, but the had
touched thv very point in these few words?I had
; ml the courage to do right; and I have often
j thought since, that this incident of my childhood
was a miniature example of the anxiety, the j
grief, and the shame, which people add to their
burden of sin, by Aaring to appear what they arc,
and failing in that first essential requisite of moral
1 excellence?moral courage.
