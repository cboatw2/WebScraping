literary paper, we arc perfectly aware tbat wo
are but repeating an oft-tried experiment. The reshit,
however, we would fain believe, will bo different.
We are, it is true, conscious of (he possession
of no talent or ability superior to that of our predecessors,
but wo rely, (perhaps, indeed, with too
lliiiuik v? iiiii ASui/E of all cjiiiCIlUlDiits,} Upon tilO in*
creasing taste of the age or literatuio ; a taste, the
evidence of which is in-fore us in the number of periodicals,
engrwed solely in its cultivation?in the
lyasu.ns, the libraries and academies devoted to science
and learning. Whilst the North and t >e
West aru thus assidiously employed in the exemplary
task of mental improvement, we will noi suppose
that the South intends longer to beur toe

it is with a hnpo thus founded, and with an in
tcnlion if we cannot win success, at least to deserve
it; that notwithstanding the uniform failure of those
who have preceded us, we have ventured to claim
the patronage and to labor for the up ilause ot the
pubUc. The stake shall be played fur; how the
gamo is to end, time only can determine.
Our object will be to render the columns ol the
Bulletin both useful and amusing. For this pdrpoae,
while one portion is devoted to original Essays,
Tales and Poeiiii. furnished from time to time
by our correspondents and collaborators, another
portion shall be occupied by selected matter cuiled
from every spot of interest and instruction, tu the
vast field of literature.
The productions of the press shall pass in leview
before us, and on every work which mertts out
notice, an impartial criticism shall be bestowed.?
To light literature and to learned science blind alike
be meted their due portion of censure or of praise,
and it shall not be our faults if our patrons do not
know the intrinsic value of every book, (at least in
onr own opinion^ before they begin to read.
Me, says Dr. franklin, who is good at excuses, it
eldotn good at any thing else; and the same we
opine may be said of promises; lest therefore oui
readers come to some suck conclusion ns this, vvt
will, without further ado, make our bow, and leave
them in future to judge from our labors whether we
do, or do not, deserve their patronage.

and beyond the rn<?st sanguine anticipations.
At tho com mencement of tlie volume an additional
number of copic* were printed, wliio.li was
considered at the time adequate to Batinfy all the
orders which < ghl lie received, and leave a considerable
numhe on hand lor subsequent calls. The
publisher is inore than gratified in stating that the
whole edition wus riearh exhausted before the issuing
of :hc 8. ventlt number of the volume; and at
this time t ut very tew complete sets remain on
hao I, to supplv the numerous orders which are
daily received trorn every -section of tho U.S.
In consequence 01 th.s great uuforseen increus" ol
now sUnscriberri, ho has determined to double the
number of impressions for the subscque it year;
while he most qraiet'ully appreciates tie unpecedented
encouragement extended to tho Ladies' Companion,

readers of the magazine and the puoiic in general,
that it is his ardent resolution to meet it witli a cor.

This department of the Ladies' Companion, has
ever command d a large share of attention, and his
been looked upon with no little iuteres by its re ?dcrs,
and .tore cep?einlly tin* Ladies, whom the
publisher is in the highest legrco anxious to pie tse
It will continue to m? a subject o!' .ore than usual

errors.
THE WORK IN GEN :R\L.
Over every dcparliucnt an equally careful super
vision will be strictly exercised by the Editors, arid
all appropriate expenditures will Illiberally bestowed
as it is the design ofthe publisher, with the aid of his
contributors and the advice of his fneuds to make
the Ladii s' Companion distinguished for the beauty
and accuracy of its typography?the variety and
high tone of its literary articles?the qualitv and
vuIjc of its music?and the unequalled splendor of
its pictorial embrdishnieuts.
It is the deter illation of the publisher to use every
means to maintain the superiority which the La-;
dies' Companion has obtained. For four years he
has steadily pursued a course ot improvement, and j
he flatters himself that Iris present facilities are such '
mo Ij.?iiu:n < ui 11 |i.i 11 lull UIIIIIIUIII uuvaniages
overall other publications of its character.
From the foregoing it will be perceived that the !
Ladies' Companion embraces every department with- ,
in the range of Belles-Lett res and the Fine Arts;
and no exertions or expense will l>e deemed too great
to render the work equal to any other extant. The
flattering and general testimonials of nearly every
contemparary journal in the United States, and in
fact, many 011 the other side of the Atlantic, have
strongly asserted the Undeniable claims of the Ladies'
Companion tothe support of the pnbiie generally.
There is no work that gives its read rs such a
great return for their sul scrip int.
The Prize Articles will all be published during the
year. These articles will com >riso the successful
candidates for the premiums <>f one thousand dollars

PATEAT COTTON Oliv.
Y_ .MlsiUiu can be made double, or single. If e
*1 made double, they reduce labor, and gin just R
louble, the quaulity of cotton over the single cylin? ']
ler Gin, do other fcnd having been in use prevous i
Lo this patent; and whether single or double, they |
are found to improve tbe quality of the cotton, by g
more perfectly cleaning it. They can be made to
contain from SO to 100 saws in a stand, and whether
small or large, one hand will be sufficient to attend
them. The Gins have mechanical feeders and J
hoppers attached to tiiein, which free the. cotton
from leaves, trash, dirt, t&c. before it can teach the
saws, and by the thorough hackling operation it
receives troui the feeders, which make two revo*
lutions to one of the saws, it is almost in a half 1
gined state, before it descends to the saw. fiy a
very simple arrangement of a screw to each set ot
gantes, on which the hoppers rest, and through
which the teeth of the leeders pass, they can be J
made lo iced slow or fast to suit the condition of
tho cotton at the tunc. When made double, the
saws are placed on two sets of cyliudcrs and turu 1
upon each other in opposite directions, and are
cleansed by two acts o'i brushes that have tour revo* ]
lutions to one of two saw. The two cylinders can
ho Hotjiohori HO as lo cnnblp thp nlnnlnr to run nn?
or both ut pleasure, although embraced with feeders, 1
&c. in out* stand The whole is put in operaliop
with a drum and band, as in the ordinary Gin, and
may be propelled by horse, s tea in, or water power. 1
It may also be propelled by iron running gear.
The force required to work it, is about the sume as 1
that necessary to move an equal number of saws in
the common Gin. This Gin has been put in i
operation in New Orleans for two or three weeks,
and its success tested in the presence of a large I
number ?1' planters, merchants and others, and | t
received their general approbation . i
Several grntleun n have been so kind as to giye ' i
the Patentee their written opinion tespeciing the i
merits of the Gin. A number of others could be
added, but the following are deemed sufficient: <

Those favorable impressions of the advantages of

Messrs. Sandford & Gnene. I have seen your Cotton
Gin in operation, and have examined the ]
cotton ginned by if, and pronounce it better clennsed,
and the staple less injured, than any cotton j
that ever came under my observation. It is completely
ready for the breaker without the aid of the |
blower, and would therefore, save the first process in
manufacturing the article i consider cotton
