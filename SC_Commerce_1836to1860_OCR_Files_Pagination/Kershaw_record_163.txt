To the Editors of the Courier:
"It may be interesting to know whet
movements the army in Florida is making

The monoy market does dot appear to>g
have been much affected by the publica- t
tion of the revenue tables, but the d'efi- v
ciency is large, and must render the d
fundholder necessarily anxious as to the p
future progress of our commerce. It is d
said that the returns issued yesterday are t
much less unfavorable than the Chancel- p
lor for the Exchequer had anticipated, and v
that he considers the present diminution h
of the public resources as one of tempo- n
rary existence merely. The October (
quarter is usually less productive than a
either of the other three, and the fortu- , v
nate termination of the harvest is, more- J
over, a circumstance which, it must be ac- p
knowledged, holds out the promise of j,
some improvement. It is, nevertheless, 0
much to be desired that our foreign trade r
should be put upon a better and safer |g
fooling than a't'present. Our commercial b
derangements with the United States will n
not, we are of opinion, be of very long m
continuance, but while the present system
of interference in the affairs of Spain and ?
Portugal is persevered in, there can be
little prospect of any amelioration as regards
our relations with those two coun- ti
tries. The Chancellor is understood to g
have prepared himself for a defalcation
of -at least half a million more than that k
which has actually occurred upon the t
quarter just ended.?Post. . p

their origin in the revolution, which resul- s
ted in the independence of Hayti. By an s
agreement between the parties, a certain a
amount was to have be6n*paid to France fc
by Hayti, in annual instalments. Owing (
to a falling off in her agricuTtUral produc- t
tic/rts, and the embarrassments of trade, t
producing a deficiency in her revenues, <!
the latter goverement has found it incon- i

tion from the President for a change of |
the terms of payment, offering after car* i
liin arrangements were effected, to apply t
one million oT francs, per annum to the t
liquidation of the balance still due on the i
indemnity. The French government ?
ha?e not shown a disposition to listen to i

TEX AH. \
The brig Halcyon from Galve$lon Bay,
las just arrived, bringing several passen;ers
and a cargo of cotton.
We are furnished by Col. W. E. Wal- (
;er, just from the city of Houston, with
he following statement in regard to the
iresent affairs of that beautiful and inte- (
eating country. The Texian Congress is t
till iri session; and occupied with a great t
tress of business of the highest impor- i
ance to the people of the whole Repub- t
ic. As yet bui one act has been passed 1
if a general nature, and that is a law re- <
fulating elections. The two Houses have
lefore them Bills upon the all absorbing t
uojecis 01 the Land, Uurrency, Navy, U
?.c.t and what will be the final action up- jc
>n them, it would be difficult to divise, c
t is believed an entire new Land Sys- J
em will be adapted to the present situa-l
ion of the country, and altogether much
:alculatiou of the detection of frauds and 1
mpositions in Land Titles. Much anxicy.
prevails throughout the country, in
'elation to the Land Office, which would ,
loubtless tend much to promote the setl?m?Qt
of tho ?oii??ry.??nd t enhancing. <
he value of land. The office wifl certain- <
y be opened by the first of March next, <
inless there should be a general invasion 1
>f the country, an event at this time al- 1
bgetner improbable. i
The subject next in importance is the i
urrertcy, upon which the two Houses are
lirectly at issue, and upon which nothing
s likely to be done, except in a spirit of
imicable compromise. The Senate have 1
tefore them a Bill, authorizing the Secre- 1
ary of the Treasury, to issue drafts to 1
he amount of one million of dollars: 1
ind the House of Representatives a Bill,
.uthorizing the issue of three millions, i
he supposed amount of the public debt, *
loth of which bills contemplate a pledge '
if the Public Domain, and of the public ?
aith, for the final redemption of the 11
Irafts. The friends of the first, contend ; <
hat not more than one million of dollars I <
ould he made good at this time, bv a ?
ledge of the faith of the Republic, and i
hat throwing out three millions of paper t
ivcr a sparsely populated country like t
hat ol Texas, would inevitably depreci- t
te it in value; which is believed by those r
he least acquainted with the subject of c
foanciering.lo be a very fair and imptir- t
ial view of the matter; It is believed a
lowever, from the contrariety of opinions i
ipon the subject, that nothing more will fc
>e done than to place the civil and miliary
scrip upon an equality, and make it a
[like receivable in all government dues, 1
vhich could not fail to raise it all greatly/a
rom its piesent low and depreciated ?
ralue, , 1;
Both Cotogress ane the people at large* e
eem to bd duly alive to the important d
ubject, ait this time, of the Navy. Large
ppropriatiens have doubtless been made 0
>y this time for speedily bringing upon the
Julf a sufficient naval force for protecing
her whole coast. The recent disss- i
ers at Galveston have left the coast in a 1,
lefenceless and.vulnerable condition: and g
f the enemy should ever think seriously
kf fiitin<r nut inrtthpr />toedition aratnst %,
Texas, it would be by the transportation
>f troops through the Gulf at different fi
joints on the coast. But they will al- (
says find such difficulty in landing their
roops, that ft will be an easy matter for ,
he Tdxians" to concentrate a sufficient 0
ores to repel their attacks.. And as to ?
in expedition by land; the Mexieans are
irell aware they could effect nothing, as
they would be compelled to march their
rorces oxer a large tract of desolate and 1
I e populated territory, where they would 3
run tne risk of starvation, and the loss of 1
their property from the depredations of i
itraggliog Indians. In ffict, situated ash
Texas is, bcr subjugation by Mexico, it
beyond the reach of possibility. And the
policy of the Texian government at lb?*
lime is to furlough and disband the army,
to relive the country entirely of the exigencies
of a hiilitajy establishment, and o
rely upon the miliiiat which is believed to
le sufficient tor all purposes of defence.
Several other matters of public interest
vere expected to engage the attention of
he representatives Of the people; And
tmong others, the. reuiOvsl of the seat of
piveruraent from Houston to some eligible
ind central site in the upper country,
vhich had already produced considerable
xciigineut, and no little sectional feeling. I
The motive which seems to actuate many
n this uteusdre, is laudable?it is to entitle
the government to avail itself, by the
ocaiion of thi? ???'
_ uv?> w> guvcniiu^ni ppon
he public domain, of the proceeds of the
ales of lots, and thereby to bring a
urge revenue into (hi Treasury. It is
herefore extremely doubtful, whether
nother session of Corighesa will be held
t the present seat of government.
The labors of the present Congress of
Texas have been most assiduously devoted
o the public interest, and cannot close
rithout affecting soide important results
ipon the future prospects of that growng
republic. That body cantairts much
alent, and sound piratical sfensfe; ind they
eeitl to have in Hew the establishing the
agislatkon of the country upon a firm and .
lurabie basis'
Emigration from all quarters was pourng
into the country to an extent hitherto
inknown in the annals ol any country,.
irhirh cannot fail in a few years to make
Texas, unaided and alone, a great and
lourirfhing country. *4he certainly offers
;reat inducements to the man of talents,
nler prize and iuduntry; and all who are 1
lesirous of connecting their future rieffli-i
lies with her, need have no iears even
n>w of their persona and property, under
lie protecting ?*is of her single star.

o fill said vacancy. The managers of elections are
equired to open their respective Boxes on the

the election.
THE LEGISLATURE.
The Legislature of this State assembled at Columbia,
on Monday last, and on Tuesday the Governor*!
Message was delivered. No business of interest hai
of course been yet transacted. We perceive thai
Mr. Yeadon, of Charleston, gave notice on Monday
that he should, on the ne^t day, introduce a Bill ti
enlarge the prison bounds of the several Districts ii
this State. This bill will no doubt embody the view;
sxpressed in an article, a part of which we copied
last week from tho Charleston Courier. We sincere,
ly hope that the Legislature may give tho subject
that consideration, which the genius of the age in
which we live demands.
THE GOVERNOR'S MESSAGE.
We regret that it is not in our power to give our
"caders Gov. Butler's Message this week, but the

lumber of hands, has prevented us from doing what
ve so much desired
As we shall publish the Message next week, we
vill not now attempt on abstract. We may say,
lowever, that it is a plain, unpretending document,
naking many excellent suggestions, and some, to
tay the least of them, of doubtful utility. Among
he former we notice that he has repeated the re.
sommendation of Gov, M'Duffie, in Urging (he necessity
of a Professorship of Modern Languages,
md a Professorship of Civil and Military engineer,
ng, in the South Carolina College. Amon? the later
we would include that recommending that a porion
of the Surplus Revenue received from the Geler&l
Government, be expended in the erection of
nonuments. The short paragraph which His Ex.
:ellency has devoted to the subject of Abolition?
night as well have been (Knitted, for ought we can
ee, as it seems to be more intended for the instruc*
ion of the members of a diffent Legislative Assem.
ily from that which he was addressing.
On the subject of duir pecuniary embarrassments,
md the situation of the Banks of this State, His
Sxcellency dwells at considerable length. Having
pplied to the proper officers of the different Banks,
or a statement of their situation, which was prompt,
jr complied with, an abstract of the whole is given,
ixhibiting thefh as in a most safe and healthy con.
iition. ,
His Excellency makes the liabilities
f all the Banks of the State 7.773 554 85,

To this must be added throbligation of the Stattf

We will not, however, dwell longer on the various
objects treated of in this document, but give it to

I TROUBLE IN CANADA '
I Her Majesty the Queen Victoria heeeome unruly
' subjects in this pvwiaoe. For the last twelve moo the
toe elements of revolution have been rife in Caai(b|
bat it vie supposed that the number of maleoonteute
were eo few ae to render a successful revolt so unoer.
tain, that the idea would be abandoned, without the
attempt being made. Tuie seems however, to havw
been a mistake, ae blood has already been shed, and
the Montreal Courier, in detailing the particulars,
says: "Virtually the whole neighborhood in which
these events occurred, is already in a state of war.**
A groat number of persons have been arreetod and
imprisoned, charged with high treason.
A QUANDAitV.
Tho position at preeont oboupied by those two
great political giants, Mr. Van Bure.v and Mr. Calhoun,
have placed the friends of each in a moot extraordioary
and sonUdihat perplexing quandary. The
question is constantly asked, whether Mr. Calhoun
has gone over to Mr. Van Burc.n, or, vice verm, add
a i a !a ... -dAs
wo irienas ot eacta in to the question, assert
that their leader has pursued the onward, firm and
consistent "tenor of his way," and"that the other has
come over to him. For our own part, haying eecliew.
ed politios, so far at least, as the Editorial depart,
ment of the Courier is concerned, we shall not pre.
tend to decide the perplexing question, particularly
as we have at this present time of writing, no very
particular affection for eitlipr one or the other of the
parties. The settlement of the question is however,
a desideratum, as many, vory many, aid in the position
indicated by the caption of this article, And cannot
be relieved until it is definitively decided. For
instance, we heard a thorough going Van Burn
man intimate the other day, that if he were satisfied
that Mr. Calhoun had gone over, he should not hesi.
tate still to "go the whole hog," but, if otherwise, he
didn't know what he should do. Under these circumstances
the importance of having an authoritative decision
of this question, is appaxeht; and as it is asoertamed
that the friends of the parties tee divided in
opinion on the subject,"" we suggest that the gentlemen
themselves aid their followers in deciding the matter.
