him that nothing <;ould relieve him of his high
responsibilities as a parent. He dropped the
whip, and left the stable, evidently in great agi
tation. I knelt down by the side of it, and
thanked God for his goodness, and prayed that
what I had said might result in the greatest good
both to myself and father. In the course of the
day but little was said by myself, mother, or sis
ter. They supposed that I had received the
whipping which had been threatened ; and as I
was silent, they did not feel like broaching that
or any other subject. During the whole fore
noon, and ahio from the dinner table, my father
was absent. Our residence was in the outskirts
of the village, not more than fifty rods from the
grove which I have already referred to, to which
I again ref sorted after dinner for another season
of prayer. Soon after entering it, to my surprise,
I discovered my father some distance from me,
walking hack and forward, apparently in deep
study. Seeing that I was not observed l with
drew, and repaired to my chamber, where the
afternoon was spent in prayer, that God would
be with my father in the grove! for I was cer
tain that he was under the awakening influences
of the Holy Spirit. At the usual supper hour
he had not returned, and after waiting for him
till dark, my mother, fearing some accident had
befallen him, (as such an absence had never be
fore occurred,) requested me to go and see if I
could find him. I proceeded directly to the spot
where I had seen him a few hours previous.—
When I first came in sight of him he was sitting
with his head leaning against a tree; but on ob
serving me, he rose up and met me. I extended
my hand to him, saying, 4 I am glad to see you,
father. Mother feared some evil had happened
to you, and sent me to see if I could find you.’—
He made me no reply, but taking my hand in
his, walked slowly toward the house. His heav
ing sighs bespoke the deep emotions of his soul.
Perceiving that he had not yet settled the great
question of life or death, I offered up my silent
prayers that God would not leave him in this
important hour, upon the decisions of which
were suspended heaven and hell.
44 We had not reached the outer edge of the
grove, when my father stopping short, clasped
me to his bosom, and exclaimed in tears, 4 O,
Edward ! Edward! forgive me, O forgive me,
my dear son, O forgive me.’ He never seemed
so precious to me before. I clasped my arms
around his neck, and pressed my lips to his
tueek, as my only method ol givmg expression
to my feelings, or a pledge of the forgiveness he
sought. On arriving at the house we met my
mother in the dining-room. My father, bathed
in tears, clasped her to his breast,1 Will you go
with me V said he. ‘ I have determined to have
religion, and accompany our dear Edward; and
will you go with us, daughter?’ (addressing
himself to my sister, who was just entering the
room.) ‘ Yes, I am sure you will both join me;
and here is dear Edward, who has forgiven me,
he will pray for us.’ So saying, he drew myself
and sister, as near into his arms as he could,
with our mother; and as though he had obtained
the assent of all, immediately fell upon his knees.
‘ O Edward,’ said he, the big tears still flowing
down his checks, ‘ O Edward, do pray for a
wicked father; pray for us all; God has heard
your prayers, and he will still hear them.’ We
all bowed with him, but the deep emotions of my
soul forbade me utterance, and nearly overcame
my physical strength. In fact I did not know
when I commenced vocal prayer. I only know
I found myself (how long after I cannot tell) in
the arms of my father, our voices both mingling
in mighty prayer for his salvation. Our prayers,
through the mediation of our great High Priest,
were heard on high, and salvation’s tide soon
rolled o’er his soul. He sprang upon his feet
with shouts of praise for God’s redeeming grace.
My thoughts then became wholly absorbed in
the case of my mother, the dear mother that bore
me, on whose bosom I had been cherished, and
who had constantly watched over mo with all
the affection of a mother’s heart. My whole
soul was drawn out in prayer for her immediate
conversion. The chariot wheels, for a time,
seemed stayed, but our supplications were inces
sant. My father, who had again knelt by her
side, tried to encourage by conversing with her,
or rather he prayed and talked together ; pray
ing a part of a sentence, and talking the balance.
My mother and sister were both weeping in bit
ter accents ; part of the time praying for them
selves, having taken courage lrom the speedy
deliverance of- my father. Their prayers and
groans, and the prayers, exhortations, and shouts
with which my father seemed overburdened, to
gether with my own prayers, all commingling
together, produced what would generally be
termed wild confusion. How long I continued
in prayer for my mother I do not know, but
•catching the eye of my weeping sister, it occur
red to me that I had entirely forgotten her—that
I had not even prayed for her at all. Bitterly
reproaching mysel/, and still upon mv knees, I
clasped her to my bosom, and bathed her with
tears of sorrow that I had been so thoughtless.
x Desougni v*oa witn ail my soul ior tnat aear,
that only sister, that he would enable her to re
nounce the world and all its allurements, and
cast her naked soul on Jesus for salvation. My
parents also prayed with me; and while we
wrestled the symbol of the divine presence was
manifest. ‘Ellen,’ said I, ‘God has blessed you.’
x Yes,’ said she, (as we bathed each other’s
cheeks in tears,) ‘ I know I love the Saviour.’—
On rising from our knees, we found, to our sur
prise, that the morning had dawned. The fol
lowing sabbath, we all received the solemn seal
o& our consecration ; and for months our bliss
seemed complete. But the destroyer came, and
they have been carried, one after another, to the
silent and lonely habitation of the dead. Over
those countenances, once so fresh and lovely,
have gathered the cold damps of death, and the
unfeeling worm now feeds upon those I so fondly
loved. But two short years had passed e’er they
had all left me; but they left in joyous hope—
they rest in peace. Consumption first poised its
fatal dart at my lovely sister, and like the early
lose, nipped by the untimely blast, she soon fell
its withered victim. While the rose faded from
her cheek, and her sparkling eye grew dim in
-death, joy and hope cheered her soul, and lighted
up her passage through the dark and dreary
waves of death’s cold flood. A few moments be
fore she left us, printing upon my cheek the last
pledge of a sister’s love, ‘ Dear brother,’ said she,
‘a few months since, your influence snatched me
from the giddy path that lead to death, and is
now about to introduce me to the home of the
blessed. A few minutes, and I shall strike my
golden harp, and swell my voice to the anthems
of the blood-washed, with my Saviour in glory.
A few years, and I trust 1 shall be permitted to
greet you and our parents all home in triumph.’
With her head pillowed in my bosom, her happy
spirit took its flightto fairer climes, and brighter
scenes. In less than twelve months, my dear
parents both followed her. I need not detail the
incidents of their happy exist. They bore a
similar testimony; and, like her, crossed the rag
ing flood in rapturous triumph. Thus, 1 have
been left like the lonely oak that bends to the
sweeping tempest of the mountain’s top. The
unbidden tear of lonely grief sometimes escapes
my eye, but the cheering prospect of meeting all
my ‘ kindred dear,’
' When a few more griefii I’ve taeted,
When a few more ipringe are o’er,’
dispels my gloom, and makes my sorrows
light.” . ,
My friend Edward is now on Zion s walls, a
faithful and successful minister of the Gospel.
Not only his own kindred, but hundreds more
of his spiritual children, will doubtless greet him
home to rest.
SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN ADVOCATE.

THE GENERAL CONFERENCE OF THE
M. E. CHURCH.
Wednesday, the 1st inst, was the day appointed
for the commencement of tho sessions of this
body, in the city of New-York. The number of
members is stated to be about one hundred and
eighty. We have not learned whether each
delegate has made his appearance in the Confer
ence hail; but as every Methodist minister is ex
pected to do his duty, we feel assured that if there
be a vacant seat, it is through providential inter
vention. There is now a vast responsibility rest
ing upon this highest judicatory of our Church. It
is increased in proportion to the increase of the
| numerical and intellectual strength of the Church
[ represented. The first General Conference had
to supervise the interests of a mere handful; but
now the welfare,—the spiritual wants—of millions
press upon the hearts and minds of our brethren.
When we consider the aggregate of our member
ship as being more than a million of souls, and by
a fair estimate, that the circle of our influence
includes more than four millions more, and then
remember that this vast amount of our population
is scattered through the entire length and breadth
of the land, with local circumstances and views on
I social and civil questions as widely opposed as the
poles; under such circumstances, to reconcile con
flicting opinions,—to produce mutual toleration,—
to harmonize the body, and to present it before
God “as a bride adorned for her husband,”—as a
holy communion,—is a herculean task, a mighty
work, which can only be achieved by the aids of
omnipotent grace.
We speak advisedly when we say, that our
brethren do not meet as legislators for the Church.
Whatever the Council of Nice may have done, or
whatever may be the opinions of popish ecclesias
tics, our Church has not—does not believe that any
ecclesiastical body has—power to make laws for
the Church : The Will of God alone is the law of
the Church. No man’s conscience may be bound
by human authority in matters of faith. We are
told repeatedly in these days of ultraism^nd bigo
try, to “hear the Church,”—to consult traditionary
legends, and thence learn our duty. But in
accordance with the principles of the Reforma
tion, in obedience to the spirit of inspiration, we
call no man rabbi. The Bible is our guide. As our
Church has it in her “ General Rules,”—“ all
which we are taught of God to observe, even in
his written word, which is the only rule, and the
sufficient rule both of our faith and practice.”
It belongs to this ecclesiastical body, however,
beyond all question, to provide for the effectual
execution of the divine will,—for the extension of
the kingdom of Christ,—for the preservation of the
Church in the unity of the faith, and for the culti
vation of the minds and morals of those uuder our
care and influence, to the highest degree possible,
that God may be glorified and the people saved.
Convened, under the circumstances just no
ticed, it will be readily perceived, that there never
has been a time, in the history of our Church, in
which the fervent effectual prayer of faith on the
part of the Church, and holiness of heart, purity of
intention, and meekness of spirit in her represen
tatives, was more necessary than the present
As a Church we believe and teach that men
should bo holy. And it is universally conceded,
that the example should be given to the people by
the ministry. While this is necessary to secure
personal salvation, it is certainly the most effectual
safeguard against the encroachments of evil of
any kind on every occasion.
me nine nas Deen when a General Confer
ence of the M. E. Church came and went without
being noticed by the public eye, that time is now
passed away. It may not be concealed, that such
an ecclesiastical body, convened under such cir
cumstances, will, by the spirit they manifest in
their debates, and the measures they adopt, make a
decided impression upon the tone of piety in this
Union, as well as affect the public mind, with re
spect to matters of religion generally, in no small
degree. Hence, also, the increased responsibility
that lies upon them. Representative bodies, in
either Church or State, wield a mighty influence
for good or evil in the commonwealth. And while
our National Councils become the theatre of bil
lingsgate slang, low abuse and base unmanly con
flict, and thus send out an unsavoury and damning
influence, let the Church,—the whole Church,—
see to it, that from all her assemblies she sends
forth an example bright as the morning, and salu
tary aB the anointing that was poured forth “ upon
Aaron’s beard ; that went down to the skirts of his
garments.”
ZEALOUS AGENTS.—REV. J. P. DUN
CAN’S LETTER.
We have just received a most cheering letter
from brother J. P. Duncan, of the Georgia Confer
ence. And, although we cannot take anything he
says, of the ability and success with which the
Editorial Department of the paper has been con
ducted, to ourself, as that part of the work has
been under the supervision of the Rev. W. M.
Wightman, who is now absent; yet, as we have
had something to do with the financial interests of
said periodical, wo do feel very sensibly the influ
ence which brother Duncan’s letter exerts in that
direction. We do most sincerely thank him for
his zeal and perseverance, and rejoice in his sue
cess. This shows what can be done when suita
ble efforts are made. In twenty days he has
obioincA fifty-eight faying subscribers ! Who will
go and do likewise 1
Will brother D. excuse us for publishing an ex
tract of his letter 1 Hoping that it may do good,
we “ will take the responsibility.” He says
“Perseverance is inevitable success in anything
we undertake. ‘/ can’t,’ never did any thing;
‘ I’ll try,’ has accomplished wonders. My plan
has been to present the claims of the paper in eve
ry society, with the very best speech I could make,
and then ask each member to subscribe for the
paper. Some were too poor to take it, and their
wealthier brethren subscribed for them.”
Now, this is praiseworthy throughout. Those
“wealthier brethren,” have done well, because
they have been considerate of the interests of their
poorer brethren. And they may look for the bles
sing of Christ upon their own souls, and upon their
charitable deeds.
While on this subject, we may be excused for
saying, that the increase of zeal in our agents for
the last twelve months has greatly encouraged us.
Our Georgia brethren, as welj^as those of Carolina,
have acted a noble part in this matter. We have
received, during the present month, one hundred
and fifty-six new subscribers. The Lord bless us
and prosper us still more abundantly.
THE DISSENTERS, vs. THE ESTABLISHED
CHURCH.
The following is taken from the London Wes
leyan Chronicle, and may be regarded as an indi
cation of “the state of the public mind on the sub
ject of which it treats. It seems to us, that when
a church becomes so blended with state interests
as to place its movements under the control of the
civil arm exclusively or mainly, it is at once un
scriplural in its constitution, and on the way to
spiritual degeneracy. So long as the aim of the
Dissenters shall be, exclusively, to bring back the
Church to its primitive simplicity and purity, and
the fixing it upon a scriptural basis, we bid them
God speed.
“ It the state Church,” says the Chronicle, “re
tain much longer its present position, it will be
the result of an unparalleled triumph, over great
moral forces. If it be destined to be brought down
from its proud pre-eminence, that issue will be ef
fected only at the conclusion of a terrific struggle.
If it live, it will have to fight hard for its life ; if
it die, it will die hard, very hard. For some time
to come, it must look forth to a stormy period of
existence. It is put at length upon the defensive.
The gates of Janus arc open; and, ere they be
again closed, the Slate Church will be annihilated,
or Dissent will be crushed for ages. A dull inter
preter of the signs of the times must he be, who
imagines that the petted and State-shielded church
in these realms will any longer hold quiet and un
disputed possession of her dominions. Misrepre
sentative as the House of Commons is of public
opinion, yet, even in that burrow of corruption, the
recent debate upon Ireland has made disclosures,
which proclaim aloud, that, if existing State Estab
lishments are to be permanent, it is not from a uni
versal opinion that they are desirable or efficient,
but must be from a powerful demonstration got up
and maintained in their favour. The House of
Commons is almost the last spot in the world in
which we expect any intimation to be made that
existing monopolies must cease, or, at least, be
very much modified. When, therefore, honoura
ble members are so much affected by the pressure
from without, or by the evidence reluctantly forced
upon them of the evils of a monopoly, that they
shrink from defending it, and are evidently prepar
ing in the easiest way to let it slip out of existence,
it surely is a loud warning to the monopolists,
that the time iB come when they must set their
house in order.
The time is fast going by when british citizens
will be satisfied that institutions of any kind shall
continue on no other ground than that they have
long existed. Another inquiry is made; viz.,
Ought these institutions over to have been framed 1
And, if there were reasons satisfactory to the wis
dom of our ancestors for these institutions in re
mote, if not dark, unenlightened ages, do these in
stitutions, the heir-loom of our ancestors, prove a
benefit to us, their distant posterity? The anti
quity of a custom, so far from becoming a reasona
ble ground for uninquiring acquiescence and satis
faction, is a most legitimate motive for inquiring
into its wisdom, utility, and justice ; unless, indeed,
wc mean to affirm that no change in the spirit of
the ago, however vital and extensive, can require
any alteration in the laws and constitution of the
kingdom in which that change has taken place. A
notion this, so extravagantly absurd, that it will be
maintained by none who do not dispute whether our
naked ancestors, with their painted bodies, had not
seen enough of the progress of society to stereo
type their opinions of every future age of the
world.
Answering to this spirit of inquiry, feeding, and
at the same time stimulating it, the facilities which
the Press furnishes, of distributing, not to a favour
ed and interested few, but to multitudes of eager
inquirers, the results of such investigations, have
been, and will continue, potent auxiliaries in de
termining the question whether great organic
changes shall take place in these realms. News
papers, containing a popular rationale of our eccle
siastical system, and spirit-stirring exposures of
its practical details, are carrying the light and ar
gument therein contained to the village, to the
artizan, to the public-house, to the mechanics’ in
institute, to the rate-payer and the tithe-payer, as
well as to the ’squire, the parson, the peer, the
hotel, and the Carlton Club. And the sound of ar
gument and the more telling voice of facts are
making many rub their eyes and lay aside their
night-caps, and inquire what has been done by
sundry persons during their slumber, it being
shrewdly suspected that deeds of darkness have
been perpetrated under cover of night.
Whatever difference of opinion may exist as to
the numerical strength or weakness of Dissenters,
there is no dispute that the Dissent of 1644 is a
very different affair from the Dissent of 1744.
During the last century, particularly the last half
ceutury, it has grown with the growth of a giant.
The abolition of the Test and Corporation Acts ;
the Catholic Emancipation Act, an Act than which
one more just and righteous has never passed the
British Legislature; and the Municipal Reform
Act,—are among the chief political measures that
have allowed Dissenters to rise from the obscurity,
contempt, and helplessness, in which partial and
persecuting legislation had sunk them; whilst the
prominent part which they have taken in promoting
public education, in advocating the cause of civil
And religious liberty, and in supporting, according
to their means, all institutions that ameliorate the
condition of the masses, has, together with their
increasing numbers, wealth, and influence, remov
ed the stigma under which Dissenters laboured,
and made them in general to be hailed and esteem
ed as the true friends of the people.
What the upshot of these events would be, it
required no extraordinary penetration to foresee.
While the oppressors were many and mighty, and
the oppressed were few and feeble, the latter
must bear their burden, and their complaints must
be uttered in privacy. To complain aloud,
would have added to the rigour of their bondage ;
to assert their liberty, would have rivetted their
fetters. The iron sank into their soul, and they
must endure. It was not baseness, but pru
dence, then to submit. The bleating of the lamb
would have awakened the sleeping wolf; and its
effort to resist would have proved the signal for its
destruction. But the times are changed, and we,
as Dissenters, are changed with them. We have
power,—moral, political, and religious. This pow
er is every day increaring, as intelligence increas
es, as the principles of liberty become diffused, and
as the rights of men become acknowledged. As
our position, so our duties, vary from those of our
fathers. It was their part quietly and meekly to
yield to political and ecclesiastical oppression.
The time for demanding liberty had not arrived.
Their voices would have been smothered in the
tumult. We can be heard', and that is the simple
yet adequate reason why we ought to make ourselves
heard. This is our answer to all who inquire why
we take part in a movement directed against the
Ecclesiastical Establishment. We have the pow
er to do it. We are in a condition to do it. Dis
sent cannot be put down. If we choose to be heard
in the councils of the nation, at the foot of the
Throne, or, where we would much rather make
our appeal, in the public assembly of our fellow
citizens, we are too strong, too formidable, to be re
fused a hearing. There may be strength enough
in our opponents to refuse our demands ; but there
is not daring enough to refuse a hearing. What
we want, is, inquiry to be awakened ; information
to be diffused; our object in reference to State
Establishments of religion to be known, and then
discussed. Dissent is the child of light. Dissent
springs from, and is sustained by, free inquiry and
unproscribed discussion. We are preparing for
this. We demand to be heard at the bar of pub
lic opinion. We arraign the Establishment as an
unjust imposition; as an anti-scnptural corpora
tion ; as a political incubus ; as a legalised scheme
of persecution. We charge it with violating men’s
rights as Christians, and with trampling on their 1
privileges as citizens. We charge it with being a
human device, a political engine, a form of An- 1
tichrist. We regard it as a scheme that secularises
religion, and that embarrasses the State. We 1
hold it as the stronghold of corruption, as investing
the ministry with usurped power, as pauperising
the nation, and as the sole cause of the religious
feuds which disgrace our land in the eyes of infi
dels. We therefore proclaim eternal war with the
State Establishment. Drawing the sword, we
throw away the scabbard; conquer or die, is our
resolve. We break down the Establishment, or
the Establishment breaks down us. No compro
mise,—no surrender,—no peace,—no armistice,—
but death or victory is now our desire.
To effect this, Dissent must combine. No one
party of Dissenters can accomplish it; it will fur
nish work enough for all. The assault must be
systematic, one on which all leading parties must
be agreed. In whatever quarters the attack be
made, there must be a general understanding, that
all may labour harmoniously forthe accomplishment
of the desired result.
This is one important feature in the proposed
Conference. It will bring out the opinions of
many and various minds. A common plan will be <
agreed on ; some common course of tactics will be
adopted ; and our efforts will be simultane ous and
harmonious. Some may sneer at its proposal; some,
who ought to act very differently, will throw cold
water upon it; some, both friends and foes, will fear
and tremble at its progress ; but let every honest
Dissenter give this movement his roost effectual
help. Let every one who conscientiously dissents
from an Establishment, now aid in the effort to
throw off the oppressive burden, and the long-in
flicted and degrading wrong. Many a Wesleyan
will unite with his Dissenting brethren in this effort
to obtain equal rights with every other class in the
State. There is nothing to hinder the people from
this attempt. No Church censure or discipline can
fall on any member of a Wesleyan Church for ta
king part in the Anti-State-Church Conference.
The Wesleyansare as deeply interested as any
other class of Dissenters in the question. They
have as little to expect as any other class of Dis
senters from the Church. The yoke is as galling
on thousands of them as on thousands of others.
They will not be so ungenerous as to allow others
to fight the battle for them, and then come in for
their share of the triumph. They will heartily
take part in the labour, that they may honourably
take part in the fruit.”
CLERICAL APOSTACY IN THE ANGLI
CAN CHURCH.
It is by no means a pleasant task to us to give
publicity to deeds of darkness, whether perpetrated
by laymen or clergy. And we give the following
extracts from an English paper, simply as a con
firmation of what we had before suspected,_that
the tendency of the Anglican Church to popish
principles and usages, was the result of a melan
choly declension in the purity, especially of the
ministry. Is this the example which a church,
boasting of its apostolical order and authority, gives
to Christendom ! Can there be a church without
a sound Scriptural Discipline? We think not
And if the English church, or any other church,
confesses itself without a discipline by which open
offenders may be brought to justice, dealt with,
and if found impenitent, excluded from the house
hold of faith, such communion should hesitate
before it claims to be a Christian church at all.
“Since our last number,” says the Wesleyan
Chronicle, “ an opportunity has been given to the
Diocesan of Mr. Marsh to explain the course
which he, as a Bishop, has taken against this delin
quent. And what is the unfortunate Prelate’s an
swer ? “ Oh, tell it not in Gath; publish it not in
the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters ofPhil
istia triumph !” Well may good Churchfolk make
this exclamation ! The Bishop’s answer is, that he
has done what he could; and that is just nothing at'
all! He says, that the Church Discipline Act pre
vents him exercising any discipline whatever 1
This convicted delinquent, convicted out of his own
mouth, convicted of having for ten years been in the
habit of spending his ecclesiatical revenues upon
“ harlots anu in riotous living,” is still the Rector of
Barnack, and a Cannon of Peterborough ; is still
drawing upwards of 1,^001. a year out of the tithes
°f the land; and ia still one of the unbroken line in
the succession of the holy Apostles of Christ !
The Parliamentary Church Discipline Act con
tains, it appears, a clause which ties up the hands
of a Bishop: and which, in defiance of Scriptural
authority, of Apostolic command, and public opinion,
which has been sorely outraged by this flagrant
breach of morals, enables Marsh to hold his Living,
to wear his gown, to draw his revenues, as an
authorised, accredited minister of the purest Church
in the world, and of the only Church within these
realms by which a man can bo saved ! The Bishop,
so he says, can only proceed by this Act; and this
“Act is not applicable to offences committed longer i
ago than two years,” and Marsh’s proved offences
occurred four years ago. This “ Act gives a
Bishop power to take notice of crimes committed in
his own diocese aloneand the offences were com
mitted in London and at Paris. And so this bles
sed Church, cried up as the purest Church in the
world, as formed after the very model of the Aposto
lic Church, has no power to visit with any eccle
siastical discipline whatever, a grossly immoral
minister, whose vices are now proclaimed to the
ends of the earth ! All, then, that is necessary to
screen a monster wickedness, if prelatic hands
have ordained him, is, that he carry on his abomina
tions in secret for twice twelve calendar months ;
and, secondly, that he be cunning enough to cross
the frontier of diocese. Then he, who both regene
rated himself, and who has regenerated others, may
perpetrate crimes that would banish a private mem
ber from any Dissenting Church instantly; and yet
snap his fingers at the dignitaries and Bishops, and
continue to be an accredited minister of this venera
ble and Apostolic Church. In advertisements of
advowsons and sales of Church property, we often
notice it held out as a lure to purchasers, that the
Living contains but small population, calls for little
duty, is in the neighbourhood of good preserves, or
is in a fine hunting country, &c. It will, perhaps,
attract the notice of some parsons who, as well as
Herbert Charles Marsh make similar visita
tions and appointments, if it shall be stated, as a
recommendation to some ecclesiastical prefer
ments, that they are situated on the borders of two
dioceses, so as to afford them the means of just
slipping over the diocesan line, and then they will
run very little risk of visitation for overstepping any
other line of propriety!
i^ouia any enemy tome rotten Church Establish
ment have invented any statement involving a more
damning condemnation of the system 1 Crimes
that will drive a man from all decent society, can
not, through the imperfect discipline of the Church
drives man out of the Ministry? Crimes which,
had they been committed by a rustic villager in
Barnack, would have brought half its population out,
with the melody of cows’ horns and fryingpans, to
burn the culprit in effigy, cannot thrust the Rector
out of the fat Living of Barnack ! How came such
an Act to pass the Legislature 1 Where was the
active Bishop of Exeter? Was he sleeping on
the benches of the Upper House, as late he slept in
his Cathedral seat in God’s House, when a Church
Discipline Bill, with provisions so monstrous, provi
sions apparently made to screen offenders, passed
the House 1 What were the Bishops about, to al
low an Act with these clauses to become the law
of the land? We cannot believe that they were
ignorant of these clauses. It were an extravagant
stretch of charity to suppose it What, then, must
be our conclusion ? None other than this; that the
Bishops designed them as a screen for clerical de
linquents.
“ The less said the better,” might very appropri
ately have been whispered into the ears of the Pre
late. The Prelate’s defence makes the matter far
worse. Wo are compelled almost to overlook the
criminal, while adverting to the criminal system
which allows him to pass without any penalty for
his criminality. Hear it, ye who laud and praise
the venerable Church ; hear it, ye time-serving Dis
senters, who are now for drawing it mildly with the
Church; hear it, ye Wesleyans, whom a misrepre

BISHOP ANDREW’S LETTERS.—No. 13.
On the morning of the 13th December, 1843,
the Texas Conference commenced its fourth An
nual Session, near Trinity Church, Montgomery
county, Texas. Now let none of ray readers be
Jed into any mistake by the name. Our Texas
Trinity Church was no splendid temple of stone or
brick, nor was it a lofty, framed edifice; but a
large building made entirely of logs, with a dirt
floor, and no door-shutter, and with none but tem
porary seats. Justice, however, demands that I
should say the edifice was not complete, twelve
months having been rather too short a time to en
sure the completion of such a temple. The Con
ference met in a snug log school-house near the
church. When assembled, we numbered somewhere
between twenty and thirty ministers, members of
the Conference. We had a harmonious session.
The Conference transacted a good deal of impor
tant business with great unanimity and despatch.
The reports from the various portions of the in.
teresting field occupied by these devoted men of .
God, were in the general interesting and encour
agingi though there were some exceptions to this
favorable aspect of matters. Extensive revivals
of religion had been realized, particularly in Eas
tern Texas. Conversions had been numerous
and powerful, and great numbers had been added
to the membership of the church. In the Western
portion of the Republic, the prosperity had not
been as great as in the more highly favored East
ern portion. In Galveston we had suffered great
ly because of the failure of the preacher who had
been appointed to serve them; the last year,—a
young man of some promise who had been greatly
enamoured of phrenology, and had speculated him
self into materialism, greatly to the grief and scan
dal of the church, and the exultation of the infi.
dels in Galveston, and particularly those of Hous
ton. This latter place had suffered greatly in con
sequence of the absence of the pastor, brother
Sommers, who had been compelled to visit the
States to procure funds for the erection of a
church ; and the result of that visit is a neat brick
chapel nearly ready for occupancy. They have a
promising Sunday school and a tolerably promising
coloured society. Of the white society we have
spoken in a former number. From some of the
circuits the reports were unfavourable, in conse
quence of the affliction, or neglect of the preach
ers; but upon the whole we have been greatly
prospered in this new and promising field, as a
nett increase during the last year of more than
1700 members sufficiently proved. And many
new fields of labour were open before us, which
promise to repay richly the labour of the devoted
missionary, who should go to his work, and labour
iu it with a soul full of faith and the Holy Ghost;
but we had neither men nor means to go up and
possess the land. We have here a vast field
open, and constantly enlarging, with the accession
of population, which it is of vast consequence to
occupy as early as may be; but where shall Texas
procure men and means to accomplish this great
work 1 She cannot as yet furnish them herself,
and must, consequently, look to the Christians of
these States for them. And before God, and be
tween man and man, we are bound to respond to
the call. Indeed when Texas first proclaimed to
the world her senarate national existence, and her
stern resolve to maintain it at all hazards, we
supposed there would likely be no lack of mission
aries. We recollect distinctly that while Texas
was considered an appendage of the Mississippi
Conference, we received numerous offers of ser
vice from brethren in distant Conferences. Good
old Tennessee sent a clever advance guard, and
from the limits of the Baltimore Conference we
had( more than one offer of service; but from
neither of these sources have recruits been obtained
for sometime past to swell the ranks of our gallant
little army in the Republic of the lone Star. The
Ohio and North Ohio Conferences, however, have
done nobly for the last few years, and Texas is
already raising up some labourers, and will proba
bly in a few years be able to send annually into the
field a good supply for the cultivation of her Ter
ritory. But let no man go to Texas as a missionary
who is unwilling to endure hardships, else he will
accomplish nothing, and will soon be sighing for
the comforts of his former home. It is known
that at the commencement of our career in this
country, we sought to avail ourselves of the ad*
vantages to be derived from educational influence.
The excellent Dr. R-uter had this matter greatly
at heart, and laid extensive plans for establishing
on a permanent basis, a system of education which,
under the control of genuine piety should bless
the future generations of Texas in all coming
time. The establishment of the town and college
of Rutersville may be regarded as having resulted
from the plaDS which this devoted minister devised
and had so greatly at heart; but although the in*
stitution was regularly chartered and organized,
and has been in operation for several years, it has
hardly met the expectations of its sanguine friends.
It is perhaps little more than a respectable gram
mar school; nor are its means sufficient to give
it a more exalted character. Its endowment I
think consists of lands which will scarcely ever be
largely available till Texas is annexed to the
United States,—and of individual notes of persons
scattered over the different portions of the country.
And in reference to these they probably afford
only another specimen of the folly of building up
institutions of learning on such a paper foundation.
During the last year, the brethren in Eastern
Texas determined on establishing another college
under the patronage ot the church. They went
to work with a great deal of spirit, and the result
has been the opening, of the Wesleyan Collegiate
Institute in the town of San Augustine, under the
management of able and efficient instructors. It
is said to have commenced its career auspiciously.
To its future history I look with anxious hope, not
however, unmingled with strong doubts. Besides
these two institutions there are others not under
our charge. There is the “ University of Galves
ton,” which amounts to a decent grammar school,
under the management of an excellent clergyman
of the Baptist church. And there is a college at
San Augustine, under the control of Presbyter
ians ; but of its character or prospects I am not
able to speak. Besides these there may be others,
but 1 have not heard of them.
Towards the coloured population of this coun
try our brethren have already turned an anxious
eye, and besides endeavoring to instruct them in
the regular work on the circuits, efforts are making
to introduce a system of missionary operation into
those settlements whore the slave population is
numerous ; but partial success has as yet attend
ed these efforts. But they afford decisive proof
that the conscience of the people is somewhat
aroused on this point, and we have no doubt the
leaven will work till the great body of the slave
population shall be visited with the regular minis
trations of the word of life. The fact is I look
forward to the future destiny of this important por
tion of our continent with a great deal of anxious
interest. What is it to be in its political, civil, and
especially its moral and religious circumstances
md relations, are questions which frequently recur
to my mind with great force. Its genial climate
n connexion with the capabilities of its soil for
producing all the great Southern staples, will ne
'e.saarily attract an immense immigration from ~
the cotton and sugar growing portion of the United
States, whenever there is a well established public
:onfidence in the permanance of the government,
ind its ability to protect its citizens, and secure to
.hem the quiet of their home, and the enjoyment
)f a peaceful and unshackled commerce. And this
result will probably be secured by its annexation
■° the Union, or its transfer to some power able tb
