Overland Mail to India.?Our renders
must be familiar with the phrase?the
" overland route to India?as it occurs 1
in almost every summary of foreign news.
This route was projected by Thomas
Wnghorn, a Lieutenant in the British
Navy, and the same gentleman to whose ^
letter reference has already been made. ^
lie published a book upon this subject a 1
few years since, from which we find ex- '
tracts giving an account of the overland i
i
route, made by the Paris correspondent
of the Boston Atlas. On the 3d of {
every month, a steamer leaves Southamp- '
ton for Alexandira via Gibraltar and
Malta ; the passage is usually made in !
seventeen days. The more important 1
despatches are sent from L'.ndon four
days later, and arc sent by way of Paris
and Marseilles so as to meet the South" i
ampton boat at Malta. At Alexandria
the baggage, &c., is transferred to camels
coo*
and thus conveyed three miles to the canal,
where it is put upon iron boats and
towed bv steam tugs forty.four miles to
Atfe. There it is transferred to steamers
and taken up the Nile, to Boulac, the
port of Cairo, a distance of 120 miles,
where carriages, &c., convey passengers
to Cairo, a distance of two miles. At
Cairo the luggage is placed on the hacks
of dromedaries and sent in advance
across the desert, a distance of eighty.four
miles: travellers have thus time to visit
the Pyramid?, and then, travelling in carrinses
or sedan chairs, easily overtake the
O 0 *
camels; the only habitations in the desert
are seven station houses built by the
Company. The passage of the desert is
made in twcnty*four hours, and arriving
at Suez, passengers embark on board
I steamers for Bombay. The usual time
consumed in the voyage from London to
f O
' Bombay is 34 days, to which 7 days must
be added for .Madras, 12 for Calcutta, 32 j
! for Singapore and 46 for China. The )
I price of a passage is ?46 from Southarnp- j
j ton to Alexandria, ?15 for the transmit
i through Kgypt, and ?35 from Suez to
] Bombay, in nil ?116, meals, dec., excluj
sivr. Kveii at this high price, the amount
of travel on this route is very great.?
j More than 4000 travellers and 50,000 pit- j
grim* are said to cross the desert an nually. j
The canal which formerly existed has!
been tilled with drifting snnd, and the
Arabs now derive an annual tribute of'
| 8-30,000 for conveying pilgrims ncros
! the desert. The great advantage whirl
I would result from the construction of ei
tlier a rail road or a canal must be evi
dent, when it is remembered that thi
number of vessels which annually doubh

undoubtedly dors not escape the loficc
of the French (hat, if a railroad shoild b
constructed, the entire want of iron,con
and other articles necessary tocarrviton,
would make it necessary for the .^asha
to call in the aid of English engineeH and
thus, in some degree, to subject hmsclf
to Ilritish influence. The agitali<n of
the question will undoubtedly, in some
way, facilitate the passage acros the
isthmus.
The N. Y. Herald'aC the 19th ins. has
the following .suggestions. The; are
worthy of attention, and there aremore
reasons than the opinion of the Ttrald
for believirg they are to no small atent
true.?Char. Mercury.
Abolition Sties in tiie South.?We
have some reasons for believing thrf the
abolitionists of the North, and thofrwho
intend to become so in the next grcii Pre
sidcntinl contest, have been preparing
some secret mission to the South, fir the
purpose of collecting all sorts of sories,
incidents, and reports, relative o the
treatment which the slaves receive from
the Southern Planters. These iccrct
missionaries or snies. under the nane of
"" I * * "
philosophers, religionists, philanthropists
arc now sent forth to the South, clarged
with picking up all sorts of infornation
relative to the system of slavery in those
regions. It is expected here, and jencr*
ally understood amongst the initiated, that
in the next great Presidential cont^t.the
whig party in the free States will bt completely
changed, and become in Hct an
abolition party to nil intents and purposes,
and in order to prepare the public
mind for that, it is necessary to collect this
?pecies of information.
In corroboration of this inlination
which has been given us, we see tlin
mmmoncement of a series of letters in
he Tribune, purporting to be furnished by
i correspondent travelling in the South,
ind descriptive of the treatment giren to
he slaves by their masters. This will
irobably be followed up in other journals,
ind in other forms, during the next year
ir two. The probability is that .the
itte.mpt on the part of Massachusetts to
end public agents to Charleston and New
)rleans, for the purpose of contesting the
mlice laws of those cities in the United
Jtntcs Courts, in reference to the slaves,
s merely an open and undisguised movenent
similar to the one we have already
lescribed, originating in the same quarter
nd for the same purposes.
We give these views to our Southern
eaders merely to put
^uMne^tevelopments are made in the
Jorth, we shall add fresh information.?
tut at present there is every reason to
ear that preparations are in progress, on
he part of the fanutics of the North, for
he purpose of introducing the slave quesion
into the next Presidential contest, if
lot into the previous State elections, and
vhich may tako a course to give the abortionists
the ascendancy in the general
government, and finally break the Union
nto fragments. In Boston, and in other
ilnces, !t is already openly announced
hat they will not stop short of that in the
iccompiishment of their fanatical purpocs.
Randolph Will Case.?The testinony
in the Randolph Will Caso was
inished on Tuesday, and on Wednesday
he argument was commenced br Mr.
O
flolden Rhodes, who is of Counsel for
he party seeking to establish the Will of
1821. Mr. R. cornmencrd by reading
he authorities on Medical Jurisprudence
-describing the evidence of madress?
aut was interrupted by the application of
jne of the Jury to have the case adjournal
on account cf the sudden and severe
sickness of one of his family.
The testimony elicited in this c?se is
so voluminous as completely to defy all
attempts to report it in a newspaper. It
will make a very large sized volume, and
will give an interesting account of Mr.
Randolph's life.
Those who know only the ccccntriciticsofMr.
It's- public life, uill, when they
see the testimony concerning his domestic
life which this trial has elicited, corfess
that they had but n faint idea of his true
character. His congressional freak* were
" trifles light as air," when compared to
the eccentric conduct which at times
characterized his private life.
We have been much struck with one
fact that the testimony has elicited?to
wit: Mr. Randolph's remarkable power
over men. Until wo heard this testimony
we could not conceive of the submisiion
to the will of one man having no pow er to
coerce the conduct of his fellow men,
which was manifested towards Mr. Randolph
by some of the most respectable
men in Virginia. In the houses of other
people, ns well as his own, his will was the

A Xeiv Euterprizs.
' It will be seen, by a communication in another
column, that the Marlboro' Manufacturing Company,
propose to tlio public the establishment of a
1 new company to be engaged in tho manufacture
of Cotton Bagging. In a conversation we had a
few days ago with Mr. Townsend, the principal
J stockholder in the present Company, he assured
. us that, by an outlay of about $2,500, and cotton
" '' 4 ' ?iMild mnnnfsipf!irf>
g at trie present ww mito, n? wu?v>
a Sagging, weighing two pounds to the yard, for
a 15 cents a yard, or, if twilled, a somewhat lighter
j article, but equally strong, at the same price.
f This reduction in the price of Sagging, it appears
3 to us, would of itself be a matter of some consideq
ration to the planter, but more especially when it
aftbrds an additional and no inconsiderable market
for tlic consumption of the lower grades of lhi<
staple production.
Let uo enter into a calculation, and mark the
result: I f cotton could be used for all the bagging
consumed in the Southern country?and wo know
of no reason why it should not?say to cover 2,.
500,000 bales, at five yards to the bale ar d two
pounds to the yard, it would require 12,500,000
yards of bagging, and 25,000,000 lbs. of raw cot.
ton, say, in round numbers, 62,000 bales?considerable
more than the whole crop of the Pee Dee
country and its tributaries. But this is not all:
the poorer qualities, which are now scarcely worth
preparing for shipment, would thus find a ready
mantel ai iiomc, ano ni eourso to this extent relieve
the foreign market of its superabundant supplies,
and still further, by diverting the labor of a
portion of our operatives into a new channel. Besides
theso considerations, the South wool J be
saved a heavy and exhausting drain upon her
resources, which at the present time cannot amount
to much less than S'J,030,000 per annutn. Interest
and patriotism both point to the line of duty,
and we trust that those who should feel an interest
in this enterprise,(and who does not?) will not allow
the present opportunity to slip without giving it a
tangible form.
Another !?We take advantage of this opportunity
to state, that our enterprising ft-llow-citizcn,
Mr. James W. Burn, recently expressed to us his
intention ol establishing a Factory on Juniper j
fiiip8C^Ir?^?y1 tjriS? am?" >avv ftiTiiTft" stT^lfTRftn |
operation. Mr. Born is just the man to succeed
in the undertaking. He i9 a practical mechanic, i
intelligent, industrious, enterprising, and with j
sufficient means, earned, too, by the sweat of his !
brow, to commence the undertaking without in. !
volving himself in debt. We have no doubt as to |
the resuit?he must?lie will succeed, if life and
j
health arc spared him, and no un oward accident
occurs. lie asks no other protection or encourngement,
than that whi?h a free and unshackled
trade will afford him.
The time is not far distant when the natural
advantages of South Carolina, as a manufacturing
State, will be fully developed. Water power is )
abundant and cheap, and the raw material is
raised at our doors. The labor of our operative*
can be profitably employed in spinning yarn and
weaving the coarser fabrics, and the world is open
to us for a market. Already goods of this description
are freely exported from the South to the
North, and we arc informed that, amongst others,
the Factory in Marlbcrough is now exclusively /
employed in manufacturing yarn for Northern
consumption. Thus, " out of evil good will come."
Georgetown.
The commercial interests of Cheraw being intimately
connected with those of Georgetown, every
thing injuriously affecting the latter place, must
in a greater or less degree, have its influence on
the former, and all impediments thrown in the
way of commerce there, must necessarily result
in retarding commercial enterprise, enhancing the
expenses of transportation, and preventing that
free competition in trade by which alone we expect
to live and prosper.
With these views, we feel that we have a right
to complain of any obstacles thrown in the way
of trade, in Georgetown. We do not pretend to
question the right or duty of the authorities there,
to enact and enforco munipipa^ regulations to pre. .
vent the spread of contagcou* disorders?their
safety, in this particular, is our preservation. But
such lows should be enforced with humanity and
kindness. Proper provision should be made for the
comfort of the sick and the preservation of those
who are not afflicted. Misfortune should not be
construed into a crime, and punished by fine and
and imprisonme it. The following extract of a
letter, received by a highly respectable merchant
in this town from his correspondent in New York,
will explain more fully the nature of our present
complaint. If the facts arc truly stated, it is cvi.
dent that some reform is absolutely necessary.
"New York, Jan. 17, 184.>.

Cotton Ranging:.
The subject of manufacturing and using Cotton
Cotton Bagging, having attracted much attention
at the South during the last two years, both a* a ,
matter of interest and patriotism, it is believed
that they can go hand in hand in its successful
adoption. Believing this to be the case, and
1 that the entcrprizing portion of the community
arc sincerely desirous to have this article brought
into general use, the owners of the " Marlborough
Factory" havo concluded to make the following
proposition : They will remove their looms from
their Weaving room, giving its use, with the
shafting, gearing and power suiTicicnt to drive it
| full of Bagging machinery, with joint use of
Blacksmith and Machine Shop; provided, a
new company will subscribe to buy the machinery
; said new company to own one-half and the
old company the other. To ba more explicit:
they suppose ?2,500 will 611 the rooms with ne.
cessary Bagging machinery, which, at ?iuu per
share, will be 25 shares to the new company, and
25 shares to the old, making the Bagging room
cost .$5,000, which would be much below what a
new concern could be put up for; besides, it could
be run at much less cost, as the Superintendent
of the Factory would attend to this room for a
mall additional compensation, and it would no
doubt pay handsome dividends. For particulars,

From Texas.?The sloop Cutter, three days
; from Galveston, arrived at this port yesterday.
We received no letters or papers, but from a gentleman
who came passenger on the Cutter, we
learn that President Jones had issued a proclama*
tion annulling the recognition of Gen- Duff Green
as American Consul at Galveston! The Presi.
dent, wc understand, states that the honor and interests
of the nation imperatively demanded such
a course.
The cause of the flare up between President
Jones and Gen. Duff Green, we understand to
have originated in a most insolent attempt on the
part of Green to dictate to the President. The
latter gently insinuated that when he desired Gen.
Green's advice he would solicit it. This answer
it seems raised Green's dander, whereupon it is
said he had the indelicacy and want of good sense
to threaten the Executive and intimate that he
would make the Executive office a very unpleasant
resting place for his Bxcellency the President.

President very properly ordered Green from his

English Farming.?Large eropt of Wheat?
working of Cowt?economy of manure, and improvement
of the soil?' Professor Colman, in his
European tour mentions an instance where a man
had supported himself, wife and son, from two
acres of land, for ?
from the produce of his two teres to purchase ?
two acres at 8144 and 8192 per acre. In anotb*
cr case, six acres under spade cultivation, is stated
to have given an average of 52 bushels of wheat
per acre. Another witness brought before the
Parliamentary committee, testified that on the
estate of Lord Howard, Barbot Hall, Yorkshire,
twenty-eight bushels of wheat had been obtained
from a quarter of an acre; being at the rate of
112 bushels per acre. Mr. Colman thinks, how.
ever, that the accuracy of this statement may be
considered doubtful.
An instance is mentioned where a man in Sua.
sex, John Piper, who occupied four aeres, and
kept two cows, worked one of tho cows in a cart,
by which lie makes an annual saving of $54.
Notwithstanding the cow is worked, "she makes
eight pounds of butter per week, besides furnishing
some milk for the family."
Great pains are taken in all cases to save the
mauure. Nothing is wasted. The animals art
are stallfed, and only turned into a yard a few
hours a day for exercise. Brick or stone tanka,

streets in cities, and distributed over the crops,
always with the greatest advantage, and with
effects immediately perceptible." AH what Mr. %
Colman saw, uonvtnced him that there is no
necessity of impoverishing the soil, but that under
the right management, it will keep itself in condition,
and be ever improving.?Am. Farmer.
Old Pickle for Pork.?Some persons place
high value on old pi<*kle for preferring pork, even
as high, as a dollar a gallon, as they find that it
possesses superior prop rties for keeping the meat 4
sweet and good. It being already charged with,
the juices of m$at, It will not so readily extraet
them from a fresh lot with which it comes in contact.
They who value this article so high!/,
saving it for six or seven years, will put down
pork in the hottest weather in summer, with very
little of salt, and it keeps perfectly pure. The
pickle should not be scalded, but strained to take,
out tbe sediment or other matter.
Texas Debt.?The statement so often mads
in Congress and elsewhere that the amount of
the r cbt of Texas is unknown, has been corroborated
by tho newly elected President of that
Republic in his recent message to the Texan
Congress. One of his recommendations to that body
is "the passage of a law for ascertaining and
classifying the public debt of the country, by requiring
all persons having claims against it to
present the same to the Treasury Department
within a definite period."?Augusta Sentinel.
Immensity of Numbers.?We never hear of

Perhaps he waa told to walk tho earth until ho
counted a trillion. But, will some folks say, he
could not count that number. We fear not.
Suppose a man to count one every second of time,
day and night, without stopping to rest, to eat, to
sleep, it would take thirfy.two years to count a
billin, or thirty-two thousand years to count a
trillion ! What a limited idea we generally enter,

Illinois State Debt.?The St. Louis New Era
of the 6lh instant, says, there appears to be no
prospect whatever of the adoption of any measures
to pay the State debt of Illinois. The State will
remain in a state of practical repudiation, and the
debt will become like llie old Continental money,

compromise for a trifle. The debt is already enormous,
and is constantly growing more terrible
by the accumulation of interest.
Tho Clarksville (Texas) Northern Standard of
the 26th ultimo says : " We have seen a letter
dated tho 11th instant, from the Hon. Wm. H.
Bourland. in which he states that propositions are
before the Government of France and England,
to have our independence immediately acknow*
ledged by Mexico, if we will withdraw our application
for annexation to the United States, and
