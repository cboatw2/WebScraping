a wig of such size and shape was quite a no*
velty in an obscure plaee, ir gave offence to almost
the whole congregation, who, both male
and female, repaired the next day to the minister's
house, and stated their complaint; the
burthen of which was, that the wig was one
of the Boston votiow, and had the look of fashion
and pride. The g od-natured minister
thereupon, brought it fortli, and bade them
fashion it to their own liking; this task they
set about in good earnest, and with the help
of scisiors, ciopped off lock after lock, till at
last they all declared themselves satisfied, save
one, who alleged that wearing any wig at all,
wss in his opinion, a breach of the commandment,
whichsaith "Thou shalt not make unto
thyself auy graven image, or the likeness of any
thing that is in heavqn above, or that is in the
earth beneath." This last objection the min j
ister silenced, by convincing liira that the wig,
in the condition it then was, did not resemble
any thing above or below. Liven so iares u
with tnen that endeavor :o please every body.
Slashed on this sidt and on that, aud twisted
into every shape, and out of ail elwpe, they j
finally come to the condition of his reverence's
wig. Remarker.

Latest from Lima.?The Editor of trie Bal- j
timore Patriot has been favored with the fol j
lowing letter, dated,
Lima Jan. 21.
The Chilian and Federal armies are now in
the Department of Huaylas, about 100 leagues
from Lima, at a distance of a few leagues,
from each other, and the opinion is gene
that unles9 the Chilhans attempt a farther
retreat nothing decisive will uUe place tor
some time. Both armies are in strong
position, and the rainy season in the elevated
positions they hold, between the two ch iins
of the Andes, is unfavorable for military opera
t:ons. j
The Chilian? escaped being forced into a 1
general action a few days ago, by cutting the I
bridges in their retreat. Five armed vessels j
have recently 6ailed from Callao in the hope;
of being able to take or destroy part < f the
Chilhan transports on the lee coast, and if they
succeed even partially, a genera! action is
inevitable.

MISSISSIPPI.
The state of affairs in Mis issippi is any thing :
but flittering. The greatest distress seems to j
prevail. The newspapers teem to overflowing j
with legal advertisoments. We hear daily of
the sacrifice of property, and credit ts a imng
which is sometimes talke of but hardly expected,
much less known.
Tt will be remembered that prior to the com
mencement of the great breaking up, as the i
dark day has been designated, the planters and
merchants of Mississippi became largely indebted
to New-Orleans. Since that period,
when cur men. anti.'e commu ity became satis,
tied that they had been unfairly dealt with by
some of the i\Iississ:ppians, who drew upon 1
more than one house for advances on th} same j
productions of the season, which were to be j
delivered, about ten thousand subs have been !
instituted, and judgements obta ned. When J
collections were atiemptcd to bemadp, by the
proper officer, the exf cu ions were stayed by j
what are termed "forth coming bonds," giv- !
iug additional security for the payment against !
n future date. The time for payment has come
around, and we understand that a declaration
of resistance has been made, threatening the
officer who may attempt to enforce the obligations.
Besides our merchant* are to suffer
another delay, as it is said, the bonds given
were informal, and have to be taken anew.
Some estimate may be placed on the situa- '
tionof thmgs in Mississippi from the tact, that ;
on a singl&tffferingdav, upwards of5,000 notes !
were tendered the Union Bank for discount, !
amounting in th*4 aggregate to about 915,000,.
000! Great distress must prevail, and the
worst may not yet have come. It is a bitter
thing to wake up from the dream ofexhaustless 1
wealth to the reality of cmbarrasmcnt and a j
luturc poverty and labor. Such we fear has
been the fate of many, and we'rust that their
backs may be strengthened to the burthen.
From the Southern (Miss.) Argus April 9. 1
The Times.?The following, which we copy j
from the Vickshurg Whig, wc feci convinced
is not an over drawn picture. The expe rience
of every day in Lowndes county teaches us,
sadly indeed, that the citizens of this section
of Uie State are but little better off than their
neighbors in the west.?Which r ver way we
turn our eyes for relief, nothing but dark and
murky clouds present themselves. V\ e feel
the pressure in this quarter severely now, but
the worst is to come, for the banks whose notes
are now ruinously under par, are drawing in
their circulation as rapidjy as possible, and
ceased long ago from discounting or making
issues, and soon we shall be without'even a
bad currency, unless individuals find it to their
interest again to curse the land with their irredeemable
and worthless shin-plasters. Our
only hope of relief is in the Union Bank, which,
?*i? j -i:
if it issues post notes noerany nnu iu;<i;uuiiis
impartially, will save many an honest and cii~
terprising citizen from ruin.
Distressing Times in Mississippi.
ICcvcr in the history oi Miss ssippi has there
been such a pressure in monetary affairs as at
the present moment?and never, we imagine,
lias the future been shrouded in a deoper'and
mort portentous gloom at this time. Here in
the city of Vicksburg, and the county of Warren,
the darkest days of 18-37, presented but a
taint picture of what is now exhibited, and from
every town and county in the State we have
the same melancholy prospect. The whole
community is laterally upon the rack, and the
best inen in the country find it impossible to
raise any amount of money, except at the most
ruinous sacrifices. We are entirely destitute
of a circulating medium, while thousands upon
thousands are pressing for th-.j collection of
their claims?suit after suit is instituted until
the docket is becoming swelled beyond any
former precedent. Property is sold daily in
our streets for one fourth its value. Men give
up all they possess to satisfy their creditors,
see their property knocked down under the ;
hammer of the sheriff or the marshal at one
fourth or les9 of iis value, and find themselves
beggars, so far as present want of means can
make them so, and still hopelessly involved.? j
We car. mention a case that has com;> to our
knowledge, which will illustrate the truth of
what we have said more forcibly than language
run A nnrtmn rvf n Rfn.^lr nf tvac cnlrl

Federal Court?the goods cost in New York
$6000, independent of freight, charges insurance,
&c., they were all new, seasonable and
well selected, and when sold brought only
$2,800, 01 much le-s than half of the original
cost. Scenes such as tin's are daily exhibited, i
A gentleman informs us that a Jot of ground !
in this c?ty which one year ago brought $5000, j
was sold last week for less than five hundred {
dollars.
And yet horrible as affairs are becoming ;
here they are comparatively trifffng to what j
we hear from Yazoo, Holmes H nds, &c. We
are informed that land and negroes are selling
| under execution fur a fifth of their real value.
; Negroes, first rate hands that will gent-rally j
: command 1000 dollars, have sold for Jess tnan
j two hundred, while some of the best plantations
in the State are heing sacrificed for one
teiu.'j of their value. When or where llnsps to
stop G >d only knows. When, or from whence
relief is to come we know not, but unless relief j
does come and come speedily, this country will
present a scene of wide spread ruin and desolation,
such as has never been witnessed before.

The following letters from the Secretaries of j
the Treasury in the early clays of the Govern- .
ment have been recently published as afford- j
ing a contrast with the course pursued by
the individual now holding the same office.
Treasury Department, Fe'>. 10, 1793.
Sia; The enclosed letter of the 27th of last
month, from the collector of Tappahannock,
relates to a subject equally deliratc and
disagreeable It is my duty to add, that
bills have returned protested to the amount
ofS3ai>0
Tills conduct, though I trust proceeding
from no ill motive in tiie collector, is of a
nature so fatal to the punctual collection of
the revenue, and at the s ime time so \ital!y
injurious to the public credit, that I cannot
forbear to submit it as my opinion that the
public good requires the superced'ng of the
officer.
With perfect respect, &c.

that another collector has suffered Treasury j
drafts to return unpaid, which were drawn j
upon moneys repotted bv him to be m his 1

I perceive r.ouung suosianiiauy 10 aisun- :
J guisli lliis case from that of the collector of j
Tappahannock, who was lately superseded j
on a similar account. Nor can I forbear, I
however painful the task, to submit it as my
opinion, in this as in that case, that the good
of 'lie public service requires a displacement
of the officer. Punctuality in this respect is
too indispensable not to be made the invariable
condition of continuance in office.
With perfect reject, &c.
ALEXANDER HAMILTON.
To the President of the United States.
Treasury Department. Feb. 18, 1795.
The Secretary of the Treasury ha* the
honor rosp jctfully to submit to the President
of the United States certain documents, by
which it appears that John Muir, collector
fur the district of Vienna, in Maryland, has
neglected Ins duty in failing to collect, or to
institute in season, suits for the recovery of
bonds for duties due to tho United States. l
j The collector has moreover failed to pay cer- j
tain drafts drawn on him by the Treasurer of j
the United State?, for moneys appearing, by {
I returns othe Treasury, to be on hand; and j
! in this respect he is found to be in the same j
predicament as the collector of York and
| Tappahannock, who were superceded.
The Secretary is Irmly of opinion that the
j good of the public service requires that this
1 officer should be displaced; and, from inquires
which he has made of* Mr. Murray,
I ot the House of Representatives, he is induced
i to believe that James Frazier is a fit character
I to succeed to the office.'
| All which is most respectfully submitted.
