Mr. Rathbun.?Buffalo is gradually
recovering from the shock occasioned by
the failure and forgeries of Mr. Rathbun,
who, though so recently employing the
heads and hands of a thousand men, and
wielding millions of dollars, is now the inmate
of a prison. Yes this extraordinary
man, who hut yesterday was lord of most
he surveyed, is now consigned to a cell four
'
feet wide and eight long ! He was struck
down in the very mid-day of a career of
unparalleled enterprise, the memorials of
which attract the eye in every direction.
All the various and beautiful specimens
of taste and genius which adorn the magic
city, are the creations of Mr. Rathbun.
This spacious church, yonder beautiful i
theatre, that splendid hotel, those numerous
blocks of stores, and those elegant man- |
sions, were ai! erected by Kattibun. i nese
stores, tilled with merchandise, invite custom
under the name u B. Rathbun." This
blacksmith's shep, this coachmaker's shop,
these brick aud lime kilns, and that
saw-mill, all belong to Rathhun. Those
stages running hence to Cliatauque, Rutavia,
to Rochester, and to Niagara Falls. v\:c.
fee. all bear the name of "Ik Kathbuu."
In short, this most extraordinary man was
either directly or remotely connected with
all the business relations of Butlalo, and
the surrounding country. His brother,
Lyman Rathhun, who managed the money
departmeut, is confined in another cell.
His nephew, Rathbun Allen, the clerk, who
is supposed to have committed the forgeries,
was arrested in Ohio, and was yesterday
committed to the same prison. The
wife of B. Rathhun is held in universal regard.
In her praise every tongue is eloquent,
and for her every heart in the city
bleeds. Lvman Rathbun, also, has an estimable
witb. who is overwhelmed in allliction.?Albany

The editor of the Brussels journal says,
We may now go to Antwerp, in one hour.
Shortly we shall be able to reach Paris in
six hours, Berlin in sixteen, and St. Petersburgh
in sixty. I fit were possible to make
a journey round the world on a continuous
rail road, it would be accomplished in six
weeks."
The following paragraph is copied from

Sea Serpent!?This creature was seen
at the inlet between Mr. Desert Rock and
the main land, on Saturday, by Capt. Black
of the fishing schooner Fox, ofSedgewick.
Capt. Black is an elderly man of Intelligence
and veracity. He says that lie was
within fifty yards of his snakeship for an !
hour; that at least sixty feet of his body
were exposed when iu morion, and that
be -must be at least twenty feet longer.?
The head w as only two or three feet above
the surface: it was precisely like the head
* * j % i^i 1_
ol a land snaae, and me neca was sumircr j
just below the head, in this particular re. i
sembling the snafce family; his color was
perfectly black, and look like a porpoise.?
When in a state of quite, about one-third
of his diameter was exposed, and Capt. B.
judged that the exposed part was about the
size of a half barrel. There wen.1 no protuberances,
but when in motion it answered the1
description of the humps. The Captain at-!
tempted to near him, but the noise of the
boat alarmed him, and he sunk and rose
at some distance off. If he had had a gun,
bethinks he could have killed him. He is going
again immediately, prepared to give
him battle. He has never believed in the
mooster before, but is now ready to make
oath to the above statement. There were j
with him a man and woman.
At the Bucksport Hotel is au old woman
who was in the boat with Parson Cumrnings
in the revolutionary war when he saw the
serpent, and her account coincides with this
city, who conversed with Capt. Black at *
Bucksport.?
NED OF THE TODDEN?AN AFFECTING STORV
OF AN IDIOT.
From the interesting letters of Espirella.
just publislted by Dearborn, we make this

CAUaw - lung iiitiu uiviic n u.i tit
these parts a poor idiot, who, being quite
harmless, was permitted to wander whither
lie would and receive charity at every house
in his regular rounds. His name was Ned
of the Todden, and I have just heard a tale
which has thrilled every nerve in me from
head to foot. He lived with his mother, and
there was no other in the family ; it is remarked
that idiots are always particularly
beloved by their mothers, doubtless because
they always continue in a state as helpless
and dependent as infancy. This poor fcl/low,
in return was equally lbnd of his
x mother: love towards her was the only
feeling which he was capable of, and that
feeling was proportionately strong. The
mother fell sick and died : of death, poor
wretch, he knew nothing; and it was in
vain to hope to make him comprehend it.
He would not suffer them to bury her, and
they were obliged to put her into the coffm
unknown to him, and carry her to the
grave when, as they imagined, he had been
decoyed away to a distance. Ned of the
Todden, however,, suspected that some,
thing was designed, watched them secretly
and as soon as it was dark, opened the grave
took out the body and carried it home.
Some of the neighbors compassionately
went into the cottage to look after him :
. they found the dead body seated in her
own place in the chimney corner, a large
lire blazing, which he had made to warm
her, and the idiot son with a large dish of
pap offering to feed her. " Eat mother!"
he was saying,"you used to like it!"
i ___
Presently wondering at her silence, he
looked at the face of the corpse, took the
dead hand to feel it, and said " Why d'ye
look so pule, mother? why be you so
cold."

THE WAV TO CURE A BAD HUSBAND.
One Farmer Potter, offhe parish of Bow,
in Devonshire, a man much inclined to sottishness,
hav ing occasion to sell a yoke of
oxen, drove them to Crediton fiir, about
six or seven miles distance?and meeting
with a good fair, agreeable entertainment,
and jovial companions, he was mightily in
his element, and did not cry to go home, but
tarried there some weeks, singing the songs
of the drunkard, until at last he was disposi
ej to set out for Bow, and taking his Land.

he, "I have gone a score to the amount ol
forty shillings, and here is my landlord eomr
for it." "If so," said she, "I'll go up stairs

EI. McLean, Secretary, the following Preamble
and Resolutions were adopted:?
A quick, easy and cheap communication
between the Atlantic and the Lakes, being
about to be opened, by means of a Rail
Boad to Charleston, from Louisville, Maysville
and Cincinnati, by way of the French
Broad, N. C., and thence, crossing the

cheapest place of passage, to its Eastern

District generally, and those of Clarendon
county, particularly, cannot avoid, on so
interesting an occasion, uniting with their
fellow-citizens in general, in expressing the
satisfaction they feel, at finding there is so
perfect a prospect of full and complete success
attending this magnificent and munificent
project?a project, rendered still more
magnificent and more munificent, bv its
C m
commencement in Charleston, with the doduration
recently made and satisfactorily
proved to be sincere?that especially, also,
as it is impossible for them to entertain a
moment's doubt, that, to say nothing of the
money that will be saved or the difficulties
that will be diminished, in passing the 3. C.
Broad, as high up the Country as in such a
case, it would do?and, moreover, when the
easy passage ofthe Road through the wealthy
and consuming districts ofthe Fork, formed
by the Watereeand Congarce is considered,
the comparative ease with which the former
River c.'ui be passed from Dawson's landing
in Richland, to a point not far below
Manchester in Claremont, a point, whence
eventually there will be formed a Road to
Sumterville, Darlington, &c. &c. from
Wright's Bluff or its vicinity, the generally
inclined plane along which it will have to
pass to the Santee; and, tthen the Road is
completed, from thence to Charlcstor-when
all these circumstances are recollect'd, the
citizens of Sumter cannot, they repeat, entertain
a doubt, that a route, uniting all easttern
S. C. and the Country between the
Broad and the Catawba, not only with the
" great West," but also with Columbia and
Charleston, & furnishing to both those rising
Cities the means cf an extensive foreign as
well as domestic commerce?that to suppose
such a route, especially when it is determined
how much it reduces (fully fii
miles) the distance between Columbia and ,
Charleston, will not become the channel of
the Commerce, which is to give to South-!
Carolina "the Emporium of the South"
would be insulting to the common sense,
I common feeling, and common patriotism of
the State, u the whole State."
The impediments to this route are to be
found in the increased number and consequent
expense of Bridges below Columbia.
However, these impediments are counterj
balanced, if not more than counterbalanced,
by the lesser charge of crossing the Broad
! above, rather than expense to l>e incurred
i by passing the Congaree at Columbia. In
' their erection, the greatest allcdged difficulty
J lias been that of finding foundations for stone
j piers, a difficulty, thanks to the published
| declaration (ride Courier) of Col. A. H.

j expense, (*) this, if an hindrance, will relaj
lively, disappear, when we recollect, that if
i Bridges should cost 6100, or even 6150,i
000, the local revenue to Ikj derived from
j them, to say nothing of that to he generally
received on the score of the great Rail Road,
j to whose extensive and illimitable wants and
1 correspondent benefits they are destined to
administer and to extend, the expense, whatever
it might be, would be rendered coinj
paratively light, and especially in the case
: of one from Ciaremont into the Fork, whentfe
I it would immediately open a road that is
j now uniformly excellent to Columbia, and a
1 road the inosi wanting in this section of the
j State, and eventually become part of the
! great Rail Road, which is to he laid down

prisoner of war on the 28th of February, and j
on the 17th of April sentenced to be shot on 1
the following morning, at eight o'clock. The

tii a petition could be s?nt to Santa Ana for a

on, and I have no idea of being exchanged scam,
j from the circumstance that the commissioners
who came here to treat for an exchange of '
prisoners could not effect it, and were themselves
imprisoned, which has blasted our hopes
of freedom before the war closes.

the body was still warm, and even that it
moved. It was, in fact, ascertained that the
vital spark was not extinct; and the room was
about to be cleared, when the sister and doctor
were buth suddenly struck dead by lightning,
which injured several other j?ersons present,
and set fire to the upper partof the house.
The flames were soon extinguished. The
I shock also destroyed the feeble Itope that had

wife, and, on the following day, three corpses
were carried to the cemetery instead of one.

LATER FROM EUROPE.
The packet Columbus arrived at New York
on Sunday from Liverpool, whence she sailed
on the 22d of July, bringing I,ondon papers to
the 21st, and Liverpool to the 22d, inclusive.
In the British House of Commons, on the 14th
- * ? - '<l
of July, tne report oiine coinimuee iu wuicji
was referred the bill for regulating the salaries
of the clergy was taken up, and debated at
some length. Its provisions were opposed by
Mr. Hume, and Mr. Buxton, and supported bySir
Robert Peel and Lord Jon Russell. Mr. C.
Buller moved, as an amendment, to allow the
Archbishop of Canterbury 8,000 pounds per
annum, the Archbishop of Vork 7,000, the Bishop
of IiOndon 4,500, and the other Bishops, 4,000
each, in lieu of their present emoluments. The
amendment was rejected, 82 to 4i> and the rej?ort
agreed to.
On the 19th, it was again taken up for a
third reading, and was vehemently opposed by
Mr. Hume, Sir Robert Inglis, Mr. Powell
Buxton, and Mr. Buller. Their opposition was
so strenuous that the debate was adjourned
to the 22d.
The bill for the reduction of stamp duties on
newspapejs was again under discussion on the
15th, in committee. A clatise allowing 25 per
* a- A - I
| cent, discount on tne penny stamp 10 mu irian
newspapers, was agreed to. The size of the
sheet, liable to the penny stamp was fixed at
1,5130 superficial inches. The Chancellor of
the Exchequor stated that he had under consideration
a place for securing the copy-right
of original articles published in newspapers.
Accounts from Spain vary but little from the
usual tenor of intelligence from that unhappy
kingdom. A battle was fought on the 12th of
July, between General Evans and the Carlists,
near St. Sebastian, but without any important
results. The Royalists appear to be acting
more upon the offensive than they have been
for some time past. The attrocious system of
butchering prisoners is still pursued to a frightful
extent. Don Carlos is said to have appointed
the French General, Bourmont, his commander-in-chief.
A popular tumult broke out
at Figueras on the lltli, in which the Governor
and several others were killed.

Murwy Market.?It is now admitted that
! the money market here is governed in a very
| great degree by the state of the money market
in the United States, and the distribution of >
the surplus revenue of the Federal Union among i
the banks of deposite favorable to the Jackson
party ; and the increased easiness in the Amer- ]
ican money market has caused, as our quota- :
tions will show, a greater degree of firmness in
the British funds. There is, however, it is ,
said, a demand for silver on the Continent to ,
replace the drain of bullion for the United |

Euphrates Expedition.?The last accounts 1
i from Colonel Chesney left him at Beles, about
one hundred and forty miles from Bir, down the
Euphrates; and he had inspired the Arabs with
such a friendly disposition and admiration of his

gard and favor, and looked on him as a magij
cian, whom nothing could resist.

THE CIVIL WAR IX SPAIN.
It appears that General Evans has issued an
order to the effect that ail British subjects found
fightingin the ranks of Don Carlos should be
considered rebels against the Kb.* of Great
Britain, and suffer death accordingly. Sir
Robert Peel asked the Foreign Secretary in
Parliament if such a proclamation had been
pu blished. Lord Palmerston admitted the fact;
though, he said, he had not been officially informed
of it. Ifsuchbethe case, Colonel, or
rather General Evans has acted without the
smallest authority from the British Government,
and entirely upon his own responsibility;
' and should any British subject b?* executed by.
lim, he would be amenable to the laws of that di
ountry for murder J?at least so say our En- wi
jlish newspapers. His having entered into w
he Spanish army does not alter the case at all, sh
is he is still in the British service, though at sh
wesent unemployed. It is to be remembered aj
hat Great Britain is not at war with Don Car- M
o>-; and General Evans's troops are only levied v;
is a private speculation?permitted by the Go- la

LATE AND IMPORTANT FROM MEXICO. M
By an arrival from Vera Cruz on Saturday &
evening last we have been furnished with our h
tiles of the "Diario, del Goberno," of Mexico, I h
to the t30th July, inclusive. tl
As we predicted domestic commotions have P
begun and are now agitating that Republic, o
The liberal party or federalists (i. e. those op- c
posed to centralism) are making rapid advan- p
ccs; they have made a bold attempt to abolish a
the present order of things and restore the ii
government to its former features, but wheth- v
er their force was insufficient to obtain the s
success they calculated upon, or whether the 1
government anticipated their designs and frus- e
trated them by timely organization we cannot c
tell: however, they were completely routed
at Etla in the engagement which took place
between 900 government troops under the
command of Gen. Canalazcv, and GOO, federal- .
ists commanded by Col. Miguel Acevedo.
From Canalizo an official despatch or bulle-!
tin appears in the Diaro of the 24th, which n
states, the federal party had 100 men killed,
228 taken prisoners; among the latter is Ace- 2
vedo chief of the revolutionists. . fi

The day succeeding- this engagement, Ace- '
vedo, Castineda, Ramirez, and Lapilladi were 1
shot; a council of war had been held upon the u
other officers but the result has not transpired, c
A considerable number of criminals had I
been condemned and executed in Mexico, du- n
ring the month of July last. t
By a decree of the general government pub- a
lished in the official paper of 17th July, an an- d
nual distribution of three dollars upon every n
thousand dollars worth of property, has been b
declared upon all rural estates.
Voluntary donations continue to be made b
throughout all the states of Mexico, to assist e
the government to meet the exigencies grow- a
ing out of the war in Texas. We have made j ~
a calculation approximating to the actual ac- j (
count of subscribers, and find ten thousand ' signatures,
but the total sum subscribed is not j
more than from five to slx hundred dollars. ! _
Wc feel not the slightest astonishment that no
more has been raised, as the highest donations
are not above one dollar, and the greatest num- s<
ber average less than one bit, 12 1-2 cents. ']
When we consider wlnt little patriotism is ex- j
hibited here by the Mexicans, in a cause which
they denominate a national one, we are amazed P
that they should still cherish the hope of sub-' ?
jugating" Texas. ; d

We are indebted to Capt Willey for the Ci
following information, obtained by him from ti
the express Rider, who arrived at lllack Creek \[
22d inst. A detachment of 110 men, under j r(
command of Maj. Pieroe, having information
that the Indians were in their vicinity, tvent
in pursuit of them; on arriving at Gen.^ C
Clinch's plantation, they found 300 Indians, ai
with about 100 horses hobbled, and 300 head !
of cattle?the Indians were immediately attacked
and repulsed, after a battle of an hour,
the whites having one killed, owing to his g
horse taking fright and running in the midst
of the Indians, and 10 wounded. The Indian's
loss was 10 left dead on the field, their woun- ,
ded they carried oft?the Indians retreated to (
a hammock as usual; they immediately ralli- a
ed and pursued the whites to within 2 miles of 1
of Micanopy when they abandoned the pur- g
suit.
The Express Rider states that Lieut. Herbert
had again distinguished himsehi and that 0
Major P. was making preparation to attack n
them on the following day. f,
Fort Drane which had been deserted by the c
white troops some time since was taken possession
of by the Indians Maj. Pierce, commanding
at Micanopy learning this marched 13
against them with a force of 110 men, and soon t<
routed and drove them three quarters of a p
mile Into a hammock. The Indians were sup- ^
posed to be from 3 to 400 in number, women
and children included. Their loss is stated to
be 30 or 40. The loss of the whites was one
killed and 16 wounded. The battle took place c
on the 20th August. The chief Powell was p
said to be among the Indians.

Sir:?I have the honor herewith to report j
the movements of the force under my com- f
rnand, consistingof friendly Indians?also, their .
present number and position. On the 4th inst. 1
we received orders to inarch to the Cowagee 3
and Hatchachubbee creeks, for the purpose of >
scouring those creeks, and in company with a j
body of Tennessee Troops, that duty was per- ^
formed?the following creeks and swamps
were thoroughly hunted; Cowagee, Hatchachubbee,
Wilarni and High Log, we also ex- ]
tended our search as far as to the Chewala, j
only about 5 miles above Irwinton. The first j
discovery we made of hostile Indians, was on
the first day we went out, and on the waters of '
the Hatchachubbee; they consisted of 12 in i
number, 2 Warriors, 1 W oman, and the bal- i
ance children, which we took prisoners without }
opposition. The next party we overtook on \ .
the Cowagee, on the next day; this gang con- (]
tarried about 40 Indians, who, when they fir^t 1
scovcred us shewed signs of fight; they
ere all stripped perfectly naked, painted in
arlike style, and several of them in the act of
looting, having their Rifles raised to their
loulder and cocaed. I spoke to tliem in Indian,
id told them to stand, to which they agreed,
[y party was about two hundred yards in admce
of the Tennessee Troops, and before the
tter could get up to me, the hostiles jumped
nvn the bank into the creek, and were out of
ght in a moment, we fired on them, but withut
doing any injury. ~\Ve gaVe chase and foliwed
them about six miles, we never could get
ght of them afterwards, they took to the middle
rong of the Cowagee swamp, where no doubt
ley scattered themselves. Night overtook
s and we quit the drive. On our return, and
urmg the next day, we discovered fresh trails
1 Cowagee and from the foot prints to be seen,
lere were some 15 or 20 in a gang. We fol>wed
these trails about nine miles but could
ot find the Indians. We then returned to
'ort Mitchell and there struck.Camp. After
raiting two days we started out alone?no
hite men with us?during this tour of 4 days,
re came upon, and captured a party of 12 Inians,
consisting of men, women, and children,
:hom we orougni wun us 10 t on Mitchell and }
ecured. We took these Indians the Ahagee
creek, a little way above the old Chea\v
Town. From this party, we learned that
fie most of the Warriors had left the Creek
fation, and gone over to Florida. A portion
f my command is now quartered at Fort Mitch11.
Some of them are Ben Marshall's and a
arty of 61 sent out to talk with the hostile*,
nd say to them, they had better come in, for*,
f we were obliged to hunt them again, we
rould shew them no quarters?this party are
till out. I have now under my command,
17 friendly Indians; only apart of them, howver,
are mounted. If we all had horses we
ould be much more serviceable.
I have the honor to be,
Very Respectfully,
Your most ob't serv't,

The Macon Telegraph states that a ?kifaish
took place in Irwin county on the 25th
tug, between a small of Indians and about
0 or 30 whites. Some whites who were
ishing on the bank of Flint Rivfer came upon
he Indian camp, and with such men as they
ould collect by the next day went in pursuit,
tfter following the trail from the camo about
2 miles they came upon the Indiana drawn
p in battle array, in an open plain, and
harped upon them. The whole number of
ndians was 23, of whom 18, & some of the woien,
were kilted; the other 5, all women, were
aken prisoners. One of them speaks English
nd says there are several small parties of Inians
scattered through the swamps aiming to
lake their way into Florida, and that a numerhave
already arrived there!

The question whether the disease is infccous
or not has never been satisfactorily dcsrmined.
The most prevalent opinion among
hysicians in parts of the United States where
: prevailed a few years ago seemed to be
hat it is not; and yet many well autbentacaed
facts seemed to show that, in some cir.
umstances, it becomes so; or if not, that the
revalence of it in a community seemed to
pread in the atmosphere a Malaria which f v
uore or less predisposed all persons to the dis- \
asc. Whatever opinion may be formed on
his point the course of safety is to cut of? as
ar aa nossible. all communication with the in
ected district All will admit tint tine, ought i
o be done if the disease is infectiooB; and it
iiirely is even more necessary, if the state of
he whole be ly of atmosphere where it pre"ails
is such as to produce the disease. Because
in one case persons might pass into the
leighborhood of the disease without being ex.
)osed to the infection, but in the other they
;ould not.
We have never heard of the disease prevail.

that its progress is arrested at once in
amilies in which it appears by removing them
nto the pine woods. We met an intelligent
oung gentleman, a few years since, on his
vay from Louisiana where he had spent eigbeen
months with an uncle who has a plantaion
with a hundred and fifty slaves on Red
diver, and he informed us that the Cholera re)eatedly
appeared on his uncle's and other
dantations whilst he remained there, but that
ts progress never failed to be checked at once
jy removing the slaves into the pine woods
vhich were but a few miles from the plantations;
vhereas in every instance in which this was
lot done the disease continued, to spread with
ts usual fatality. If this be a fact, of which
,ve have no doubt, it is a very important gne.
