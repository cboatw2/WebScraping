CONGRESSI
T ecolfmns of our paper -are almost
exclu 7.y occupied with congressional
matter, much 'of which is importabt and
interesting, especially the message of the
President relating to Mexico and Texis.
The reader will find a'synopsis, copied from

to the litest dates. We must, however,
call attention to the. rollowiing particulars:

Mr. Giddings, of Ohio, gave notice that
lie would introduce a bill to repeal all acts
of Congress heretofore passed for the sup
port -ofslavery, or the slave trade, within
the District of Columbia. This is one of
'toisequences resulting from the repeal of
-the rule which prohibited the reception of
labolition petitions.
--i the Senate, December 19, Mr. Atch
ison, of Missouri, introduced a bill to or
ganize the governmrent of Oregon. Mr.
Archer and nearly all the whig senators
'opposed the reference . of the bill to the
committee on territories, and insisted that
it-should be referred to the committee on
foreign relations, -becatse if the Senate
wore to act on the bill, before conclusion of
'the negotiatiob with G.' Br. on that stb
ritory, it 'would be 'disdou-rteous (o 'tbht

in referring tIr bilt to a select -comminlee.

Such remonstrance, urged in no unfriend

siderations of an imperative character,
having relation as well to the peace of
this country 'ad -h6uor of this Govern
'ment'as to the cause of humanity and ci

Treitv of, Annexation-upon the invitations
6f'thoexecutive; and when,for that act,
she wis threatened with a renewal of the
whYoan the part bf me'xico, she naturally
looked to this Government .to'interpose its
efforts to ward off the threatened low.
But one course was left th'e Executive.
acting within the limits of itsvcnstitution
al competency, and that was to protest in
respectful. but at the same time strotrg
and decided terms against it. The war
thus threatened to be renewed, was p'ro
mulgated by edicts and decrees, *hich
ordered, on the part of the Mexican miii
wtry, the desolation of whole tracts'df
country, and the destruction, withobt dis
crimination, of all ages, sexst, and condi
tions of. existence.
0ethe manner ofI.on-ducting war,

#6rlod of larba sm wIiicb, happily' for
*.the world, has long since passed away.
All nations are interested in.enforcing 'an
observance of thosesprinciples, and the
United States, the oldest of the Anitrich'n
Republics, and the herpst of the civilized
powers to the theatre ow.n- which the'se
enormities were proposed, to be inacted,
could not quietly content themseves to
witness such a state of things. ::They had,
through the Executive, 'on-abother occa
sion, and as was believed with the.appro
bation of the whole country, remonstrated
against outrages similar, but even less in
human, than those which by her new
edicts and decrees she has threatened to
perpetrate, and of which the late inhumou
massacre at Tobasco was but the precur
sor.
The bloody and inhuman aiird6r of
Fannin and his companions, eqdtlled only
in savage barbarity by' the usages of the
untutored Indian tribes;pio'ed htdiv little
confidence could be placed on 'tie most
solemn stipulations of her Generals, while
the fate of others who became her cap
tives in war, many of whom. no longer
able to sustain the ratigues and privations
of 'long journeys, were shot dovn by the
*ay side, while their companions who
survived were subjected to sufferings even
moie'aitful than death-had left an inde
lible stain on the page of civilization. The
Executive with the evidence of an inten
tion on the part of Mexico to renew
scenesso revolting tb humanity, could do
no less then rene* remonstrances formerly
urged. For fulfilling doties so imperative,
Mexico has thought proper, through her
accrediied organs, because she has ha: re
presented to her the inhumanity of such
proceeditg, i6 inidulgo- iii languago un
known to the courtesy of diplombtic in
tercoudbt, dnill offensive in the highest de
gree to this Govordment and People.
Nor ha: the offended in this only. She
baa not only violated existing duventio..
beiween ihe Iwo bountries. by aibitrary
and unjust decrees against ou'r trade and
intei-cottrse; Ubt ivithholdi instalments of
debt, die to oui citiiens, %Vhich she so
lediily pledged hbrself to pay, under ir
umstanche which arb fully explaied by
the accu1panying lecter from Mr. Grien,
our Secretary of Legatidh. And when
our Minister has invited thie littention of
her Gover-nment to wrongs comriitted by7
her local authorities not only on the pro
perty but on the persons of our fellow
itizens, engaged in prdsccuting faii. and
hotnest pursutits; she has added Insult to in
jury, by not even decignitig, for monthd td
gethier, to return an artswer to hits r6ape
sentations.-Still fturther to manifest hie
unfriendly feeling towards the Utited
States, she has issued decrees expelling
rom some of her provinces Amerienn
citizens engaged in the peaceful pursuits
of ifI, and now denies to those of our
citizend prosentting the~ Whale Fishery on
Ihe Northwest coast of the Pucifie, the
privilege which has, through all tidie, here.
iofore been accorded to them, of excliatnk
ing goods of a small amount in value at
her ports 'mt California for supplies indis
pensable to their health and comfort.
Nor will it escape the observation of
Congress, that in conducting a correspon

States, whro cannot, dad does not, know
any distinction between the geographtical
etions di the Union, charges wholly on

if it could have adopted a conise of peolfe~y

the question was neither local net s'ectional,

which was made to actuire -Texas wat-r
during tiie'administra oil distinguih
ed citizen from an Eastern State, which
was tifterwards-reneved 'under the auspi
ces of a, Presiden 'from the.Southwest,'
she will awake to a knowledge of the fu
tility of her present purpose of sowiug
dissensions among us, or producing dis
traction in our Councils by attacks either
on particular States, or on persons who
are now in-the retirement of private life.
Considering the appeal which she now
makes to eminent citizens by.name. can
she hope to escape censure-for having
ascribed to them as well as to others, a
design, as she - pretends. no*, for the first
'timo revealed, of' hav'tig 'originated nego
tiations to despoil'trer, by duplicity and
falsehood, of a portion of her'territory?
The opinion then, as now, prevailed with
(lhe .tbutiVe, thit i6ie Annexation c'f
Texns to the Union was 'a mailer of vast
importance. . '. ' -
In ordcr to acquire that territory. before it
had assumed a position iimiong the independ
ent powers Ofthe 'earth, p.-opiitioni were
made to Me'xico "for . ' ces I on'6('it to the U.
States. Mexico saw in these sprdceeings at
the timo, no cause ofcomplaint. She is now,
wheii simply reminded or them, awakened
to the knottiede of the fact, which she,
through her Secretary of State, promulgatesto
the whole world as true, that those negotiations
wero founded in deception and falsehood, and
supetinduced by unjust and iniquitios motives.
While Texas wias a dependerdcy of Mexico, the
United States opendit negotiatiois with the
latter power for a cession of her then acknowl
edged territory; 'and nbw that Te'xas is inde
pendent of Mexico, and has maintained a sep

time Ae has been'received into the family of

bassad'ors it riany 6f th'e pridoipal Coerts of
Enrope,-and when it has become obvious to the
wlelo.*6rld that she is forever lost to Mexico,
the United Stktis is chiiiged vi'th deception and

d'ehntary pccusations are made against States
whit a liiae hal o6'speclil ieney'in the mat

tention, through her SeeratA offoreign Af.
roirs, neyxer to cousen) to the. nclopenflodee of
Texas. or. to hbandon the efort to reconquer
that Republib. She thns announces a perpet

furnish her 03 plansible ii ground for discon

that time, may enter into a Treaty with Texas,
as altc possesses 'at this momet against the
United States. The laipse.of.ijme can dd

A course of conduct such as ha bann'de
scribed out the part of Mexico, in violation df
ill friendly feeling, arid of the courtesy, which
should characterize the intercourse between the
Nations of the Earth, might well justify the
United States in a resort to any measure to
vindicate their national honor; but actuated by
a sincere desire to presesivi the genei-l peace,
and in view of the present condition of Mexico
the Executive resting upon its integr'ity, and
not fearing but that the judgenent of the world
will duly appreciate its motives, abstains from
recommending to Congress a resort to meas
ures of redress, and contents itself with re-ur
ging upon that body prompt and immediate ac

i-g that measure; the. United States will be in
the exercise of an undoubted right; and if Mex

claration of war against them, upon her head.

As the ol. year passos away, the new year
dawns'upen us. We bid it right welcomey
To many it co'uis, bringing alofg with it the
most 'pleasurable anticipations. To many, es
pecially those who haVe notyet passed the me
ridian of life, hope paints ihe finre in its most
brilliant colors; To 'these, life now seems but
i long, 'snm'ier iay. Theie zon the close of
the yeaiwillbe doomed to. deep and bitter dis.
appointrient, unless they look up to the great
source or-enjoyment', the author of every good
and perfectgift As the new year begins, let
ba all resolve to begin new4ives. Let.every
man resolve to think as w'6l of bis neighbor as
he'can, to do him him a. madj good deeds as
hle can, and though troubles and difficles may
come, he can take up his armor, iaAipproving
conscience, stronger than that of the iuail clad
knight, and manhfully oppose them. May we
all so live, that when our summer. is ended, and
the winter of age shall come I'ui 1s, we may
aimly sink into our lasAreistin'g place, coni
lently awaitin the dawn'df a b*ghter and a
andre glorious day.
Eighteen hundred and forty-four. has gone,
and is now numbeed with "the years bey 'd
the flood." In its.passage,.clouds and tin
pests often veiled.the Heav'en's from our view,
nd fora season all wasenveloped in obscurity.
rhe floveirs and 'fruits of the earth were often
swept away'in tie march of tho storm, and a
deep gloom beclouded the fair face of nature.
But at length the wild commotion ceased, the
bright silfi shone 'again, tie flowers again
sprung forth, andthe earth yielded b kindly
fruits.. Ifthis be true of the natural world, it is
equally so with the moral world. The' storn
of trial and 'aillictiWd may long bow.ogr heads
to the earth-the darkness' ogrief,.maylong
cover 'our.. hearts, and there. may not be
one ray of hopo to light up the gloom-but'at
last, the tempest will cease its rury, our troub
lea will have ended, and the sun -of peace will
beam more brightly upon us. This is particu -
larly true with regard to those who trust ins an
overruling Providence. To such,thelight afihic
tion of the world is but for: a moment, and in
the end they shall rejoice wih exceeding great
