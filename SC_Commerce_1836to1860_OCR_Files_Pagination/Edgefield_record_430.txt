*fr. Editor,
We deeply rcgret to perceive'the shis mix
-devices which are ow resotted 'to, in the po
litiea canvass of the day.. Truth -and fairnew
heem tointerpose no obstac4e-in the way .f th"sI
-who bave some favorite object te accomplish
If it .is desirable te -sacrifice any one, the viles
-and most islidions attempts -are made to pros
itate him; thus the prejudices and passions o
Ahe people are ineamned, and not uisfrequently
:the virtuous and thighmnnded gentleman is pu
aside to make way for the intriguer and Ih
Demagogne. Tids state of things must be cor
rected. or the time will speedily arrive, wher
.= qiet ad peaceable citizen, will consent tc
become a caudilate. for the suf'rages of his fel.
low titizeus. He will prefer the quietude ol
.home, to the strife and conf'usioi incident te
'the present state of things. Let the people re
.Ja, and consider, and apply tihe remedy.

bow such false reports can get afloat. I assert,
.;that that bill was laid on the table without any
-opposition, and that no vote was ever taken
upon it. By refering to the Act of the Legisla
ture. passed at the latsesion. page 169, it will
be seen that what I here assert is true. I k onw
that the genteman who is now charged with
introdmtcitg and advoonting that bill was op

A .3isaR or THE LAST LEGIS.ATURE.
Oct. Gth, 1840.
From the Charleston Mercury.
We are glad to see ;hat even the w hig
papers of Geomria are startled at the senti
ments and principles that form the basis of
the coistitution of the Richmond A holition
Society. of which Gen. Harrison hboasts to
have been a member "at the early ao,e of
eighteen " Us presents points tideed at
which a Southern mal even in the mad
dest partiziti fury, caniiot but shrink back.
Besides abounding in the coarsest and
most insmlting ant of Abolit ion, it express
ly provides that "no person shull lie a
nember who holds a slave or is concerned
in the urighteous trafic of buying or sel
ling that tunhappy race of huimom beines."
It is niot thme crime of Gen. H. that he
was a member of this society in his youthm,
but that in manhood amnd in olid age-in
thevear 1821, anid again in 1b10. he has
ptublishmed it, claimned it as a merit and re'
comnmended himelf to the Abholitioniist<
on the groundl that he had been faithful
all his life to the oliigatios he then caine
uwider. [low this can be got over, it
wonld puzzle even a whmig patia to dis
cover. We shall see how they have at
enmpted it.
The constittion of the Richmond Aho
litionm Society was publiehed ins the 'Na
tional Inquirer, a Peiinsylvamnia papier a
bout four years ago and passed without
mueh comment, because at the time rno
body at the South cared what were tihe
opinionsanid wvhat had been the c'onnec
tionis of Win. 11. H arrison. The presiden
tial elections had passed, and he wvas sup
posed lo be politically nothing. But the
document was then published because it
was foundi among the papers of a gentle
man then recently deeused, Mr. Thomas
Shipley, andl was regarded as5 a curiosity.
The recent contest about the character oft
this Society. which Gen. HI. htimself, by
his manifold eqiivocationus has in great
measure given rise to, ittdneed a corres
ponidemi of the Petnnsy'lvania Freemamn, to
copy it an.1 sc .i irto' thatt paper abmout a
mon~uth and as halfago. It embhraices a

tidnsed ; till for the first time the Angusta
Chronicle and S.-ntinel p)ronouneen ii a
forgery-tnot becau~e anyv hody' in Virginiat
has given color to such an opinmion, but
from internal evidence. General Hlarri
son was the son of a slave holder, antd
therefore accorin;; to this learned expons
der of law, could not at thie age of eighteen
bave been a member of a society that ex
cluded slaveholders! All thme othe prttmfs
oift he Chkronicle are mere nothing, andh tor
this, we -,re fully impressed with tihe conm
viction that Gen. Harrison never didi own
a slave imm his life. The authtienicity oflihe

BANK RESUMPTION.
The Philadelphia Banks have recent
hiad A'Cnvention," to consult when th,

whev tbey should discharge their oblin

cause it is their policy to keep 'ha

The City Banks have agreed to aid tl
