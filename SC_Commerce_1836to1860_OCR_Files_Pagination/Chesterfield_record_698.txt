T
committed high crimc6, seek an asylum in the
t< rrritorio* of a neighboring nation, would seem to
be an act due to the cause of general justice and
and properly bi longing to the present state of tivihzatioa
and intercourse. The British provinces
of North America are separated fr?>m the etat'.s
of the Un on by a line of several thousand miles,
and along portions of this line the amount of popuJ
ttion on either side is quite considerably while
the passage of the boundary is always easy.
Offi-ndera against the law on the one side, trans- i
for themselves to the other. Sometimes, with great
difficulty, they are brought to justice, but very j
oten they wholly escape. A consciensciousness ;
of immunity, from the power ot avoiding justice
- and rack.
in this way, in?igai<-t> wwr....~.t (
I- * to the commission of offences, and the peace j
and good neighborhood of the borders are cons:,
qncntly often disturbed.
In the case of offenders fleeing from Canada
info the United Statce, the governors of states arc
often applied to for their surrender, and questions 1
of a very embarrassing nature arise from these ap- '
plications.?It has been thought highly important,
therefore, to provide for the whole case by a proper I
treaty stipulation. The article on the subject in
the proposed treaty is carefully confined to such
offences as all mankind agree to regard as hcin- '
ous and destructive of the security of life and pro- '
property. In this careful and specific enunicra- j
tion of crimes tlic object has been to exclude all j
political offences or criminal charges arising from j
wars or intestine commotions. Treason, mispris. ;
ion of treason, libels, desertion from military ser- j
vice and other offences of similar character, are j
excluded.
And lest some unforeseen inconvenience or unexpected
abuse should arise from the stpulation, j
rendering its continuanee, in the opinion of me or ,
both of the parties, not longer desirable, it is left in '
the power of either to put an end to it at a will.
The destruction of the steamboat Caroline at
J^ehlosscr, four or five years ago, occasioned no j
small degree or excitement at the time, and be- j
e iroc the subject of correspondence between the
two governments. That correspondence having j
been suspended for a considerable period, was re- i
newed in the spring of last year; but no satislac- ,
tory result having been arrived at, it was thought j
proper, though the occurrence had ceased to be
iretiii and recent, not to omit attention to it on the J
present occasion. It has only been so l'ar discuss- I
td in the correspondence now submitted, as it was
accomplished by a violation of the territory of the

tr, while he attempts to justify that violation up. 1
on the ground of a pressing and overruling necessity,
admitting, nevertheless, that even if justifiable,
an apology was due for it, and accompanying this
acknowledgment with assurances of the sacred
regard of his government for the inviolability of i 1
national territory, has seemed to me sufficient to j
warrant forbearance from anyfurtherrcmonstrance I
against what took place, as an aggression on the 1
oil and territory of the country.
On the subject of the interference of the British
authorities in the West Indies, a confident hope is '
entertained, that the correspondence which has
t ikon place, showing the grounds taken by this
government, and the engagements entered into by
the British Minister, will be found such as to satisfy
the just expectation of the people of the United
Stnt* s.
TV impressment of seamen from merchant i
vowels of this country by British cruisers, although (
n<?t nractised in time of peace, and, therefore, not
jjf present a productive cause of difference and irritation,
ha*, nevertheless*, hitherto Ik en so promin
nt a topic of controversy, and is so likely to bring
on renewed contention* at the first breaking out
of a European war, that it was thought the part
o> wisdom now to take it into serious and earnes :
consideration. The letter from the Secretary of :
State to the British Minister, explains tlie ground j
which the government has assumed and the prin-'
crplts which it means to uphold. F<>r the defence !
of these grounds and the maintenance of these j
principles, the most perfect reliance is placed 0:1 ,
the intelligence of tl.e American people, and on
their firmness and patriotism, in whatever touches
the honor of the country, or its great and essential
interest*.

Washington, August, 11, lb 12.
REMARKS
Of Mr. Campbell of South Carolina, in the House
of Representatives on the '20th August, on a
motion to amend the bill to regulate the taking ;
of testimony in cases of contested election'
Thr bill to regulate the taking of testimony in .
cis** of contested election having been returned
from the Senate with amendments, the question
was on concurring with the first amendment as
fi.llnws, viz:?
14 And provided further, (in substance,) That
nothing in this section, or in ine aci uicuim tna.
lt d to, [the districting clause of the apportionment
hill,) shall he held to extend to the election of any
{'Tsr.n who shall be choeen a Representative to the
iSth Ccngrcw in any State in which, by the laws
of such State, the election of Representatives to
Congress :# re quired to be made by general ticket,
and "where th?* election has been h'-l i, or may be
held, before the regular session of her Legisl iturc,
according to the act entitled, 4 An act providing
for the apportionment of Representatives among
the several States according to the sixth census
unless the Governor of any .State shall, before the
time appointed by law for holding such elections
therein, by his proclamation, postpone the same
until after the next meeting of the legislature
thereof."
mr. Camtofi l of South Carolina moved to strike
out all after the word 44 State," where it firyt ocruw,
and insert, 44 m conformity with the laws of
SJeb State."
" Mr. C had innaperable objections to the amendment
of the Senate. It proposed to exempt persons
claiming a seat in Congress, from some of the
States, from the operation of a law which all others
were required to comply with. Georgia and
New Hampshire, for example, both elect by general
ticket; yet, under the oj>e ration o: this amend,
mcnt, persons elected from Goorgia will be admitted,
while tho6e elected from New Hampshire, under
similar regulations, will be excluded. The
amendment should uthtr be rejected entirely, or
fi"> modified as to be made uniform in its operation.
The elections for Con Tress, as prescribed by pre
existing regulation* in some of the States, coining
on before the regular times of the nnr ting of their
J ogislature?, afforded an argument of convenience
r hv the operation of the second 6 ction of the up.
j ortionmcnt law should h( suspended; but ho ohj>
'*tcd to giving it a partial operation. I1 suspend,
t J as to part, it should be a? to all. Some of th
States, in which the election!*, as now prescribed,
come on before the regular sessions of the Legislatures,
may elect by double or treble districts:
yet the amendment of the Senate made no provision
for such cares; and if they existed, members
thus elected would be excluded, while such as
were elected by general ticket would be admitted.
.Air. C. felt most anxious to promote harmony,
and to avoid all danger of conflict with State au?
thoritics, even although satisfied that such conflicts
cannot occur except under the influence of the
most unreasonable prejudice, and the greattst
mistake as to the true character of their duties.?
To ensure this desirable object, he had offered an
' 1 1 L ---? -'a !,/? nncrnfinn nf
QinCnUIlit'Ill WHICH WUU1U duo^ciiu u?v Uktv*. w.
the districting clause of the apportionment law until
after the next Congress had served out its term;
relying, in the mean time, upon the intelligence of
a patriotic people to rebuke that reckless spirit of
party by which a measure so conservative of our
institutions is threatened, and, by the expression
of their opinions at the ballot-box, to preserve it
from the danger of repeal. It had been said that
the friends of this measure were afraid to trust it on
a second trial in the House. The amendment
which he offered would show that, so far as he
was concerned, this was not the case. Gentle,
men had an opportunity of now deciding whether,
taking all things into consideration, they would
agree?not to repeal, but to suspend the law until
after the next Congress. That Congress, elected
under the various systems adopted by different
State Legislatures, would have opportunity of re-1
pealing it. But let the subject, in all its bearings, '
be submitted to the people; let it be carried to j
the ballot-box : let it be made a test in the elcc
tions everywhere, and he feared not the result.
In the event of the amendment which he proposed
being adopted, it would be left entirely to
the discretion of the State Legislatures to prescribe
what regulations they may think proper for the
congressional elections; and, as a respectful argument
to them in favor of the single district system,
lie would read extracts from a letter which he had
just written, in reply to one from a gentleman of
great distinction, residing in a Southern State,
which lias hitherto elected by general ticket.
It may appear to gentlemen, at first, that some
of the positions taken in this letter address them- 1
selves with more force to the South than to the !
North. But such is not the ease. The United
States is our common country; and the intelligent
patriot, whether residing amidst the snows
of the North, or the sands of the South, must !
equally deprecate the power of an utter overthrow
of the balance of power between its different see- ,
tions in the National I-egislaturc.
Mr. C. then read the following extracts from
his letter :
" Whether, under existing circumstances, the
single-district system is the best that can be adopted,
or not, it appears to me that all gentlemen of
intelligence, whose opinions arc uninfluenced by
prejudice, must admit that some action on the
part of Congress was proper?1st. To restore uni- !

encc of the small States from the danger of being
overwhelmed in the universal adoption of the general
ticket. 3d. To protect minorities throughout
the Union. 4th. To protect the minority section
of the Union. 5th. To preserve the Democratic
feature of the Government from annihilation.
" The practical operation of the different systems
that now prevail in the elections of different States,
has been to destroy equality in representation in
proportion to numbers; and, in this way, to assail
the fundamental principles of our Government in
the popular branch of its I/Cgislature. The great
State of New York, for example, with her forty
members in the present House of Representatives,
is outvoted upon every question of importance by
the little State of New Jersey, with six members,
by a majority of three to one. Virginia, with her
twenty-one members, is outvoted by the little State
of New Hampshire, having but five, all told. Pennsvlvania,
with more than three times the number
of members, is outvoted by Georgia, K,c.
44 Some of my friends have loudly condemned
me for having, as they say, through the agitation
of this question, roused a sleeping lion; and, Inshowing
the large States their real power, have
produced a danger which did not before exist.
But is it possible to suppose that the glaring ine- ;
quality which I have pointed at can long exist, i
when the States now electing by districts could
remove it at any time by the adoption of the general
ticket ? Indeed, in addition to the seven
States now electing by general ticket, another
(making eight) has prescribed that her election for
1 * - - 1 ^ ?r.lrA nl .ofl ooonvrlinrt
mc ncxi \.-ongrtM eiiuiiian.t pinw
that system; and in several of the other States?
among them, the great State of Pennsylvania?
the question was quickly agitated immediately before
the passage of the districting clause of the
apportionment law. However inapplicable to
some of the large States the general ticket may
be, the existing slate of things, if permitted to continue,
would compel them, in their own defence,
to adopt it. The fi~st example would be soon followed
by all the rest. Members elected by general
ticket would naturallybc partial to that system ;
and if Congress had not acted at this session, 1
doubt if the time would ever have occurred again,
when it would have been possible to do so. The
districting of any Stitc is attended with more or
less inconvenience. Under a new apportionment,
the temptation is strong with a Legislature to
prescribe that the first election shall be by general
ticket. The election being in this way, the system
obtains advocates. The second election
is also held by general ticket; and so the system
becomes established. This, vou see, is a con'
sideration of convenience, operating in conjunction
with the natural and proper desire to have as
much influence as other States, in proportion to
S numbers, in the House of Representatives.
44 The violent opposition which thin measure has i
j encountered from Southern members of Congress, I
j and Governors of some of the Southern States,
| has been to me unaccountable. Whether elected
! as Whigs or Democrats?whether elected by dis.'
j tricts or by States?the members from the South
i
* As an evidence that one of the principal rca'
sons of conferring on Congress a controlling pow.
i er over the times, places, and manner of elections,
was to insure uniformity, 1 will, for the present,
leferonly t?the reply of .Mr. .Madison to an inquiry
) of .Mr. Monroe, in the Virginia convention that
adopt'd the constitution. Mr. Madison said:
44 It was found impossible to fix the time, place,
I and manner of the election of Representatives, in
j the Constitution. It was found necessary to leave
the regulation of these, in the first place, to the
Stat* Governments, ie being best acquainted with
the situation of the people, subject to the control
f'f the (it ner.il Government, in order to produce
uni/on:,'tij, ;?nd pre*out it-i own dissolution."
present an unbroken phalanx upon certain great
questions, thought to be essential to her prosperi.
ty. One of these questions?to wit, a protective
tariff?will always command a majority in almost
every Northern and Western State. If elected bv
general tie'eet, the vote of these States would be
overwhelming. In each one of them, however,
tl.ere are !arg; minorities who think as we do.
Electing by the district system, we are enabled to
avail ourselves, to a considerable extent, of these
minorities; ana in us, 111 nme ihcmuic, tuuu.ciaui
that inequality in population which every census
shows to be getting greater and greater against
us.
,l We have hitherto looked to the Senate as the
conservative body of our National Legislature.?
But look at the map of the United States. Flori.
da is the last card we have to throw. Wisconsin
and Iowa will both be ready to come in as soon as
she is. Look still further west, beyond our organized
Territories, and you will see an immense
region, now ready for the axe of the pioneer, out
of which, before fifty years have passed away, a
dozen non.tlatehold.ivg States may have their
Senators in Congress. Suppose that a majority of
each, or even of most of these States (not a very
improbable supposition) should be disposed to enter
into a crusade against our peculiar institution, as
Mr. Adams calls it,?where would be our protection
with a Senate in which we arc thus outnum
bered, and a House of Representatives elected
from each State by general ticket? We would
have none. No, not even a shadow of protection,
except a dissolution of the Union.
" Independent, however, of all sectional considerations,
that representation is certainly most
congenial with liberty, which most nearly reflects
the light* and shade* of political opinions entertaincd
by the constituent body. By the general
ticket, the voice of the minority in a State, let it
approach ever so near an equality in number with
the majority, is entirely suppressed. So much so,
indeed, that they have not even the poor privilege
of remonstrating against the passage of measures
to which they are opposed, but must remain dumb
under the most aggravated misrepresentation of
their motives; and quiet, under the greatest injustice
! If, in an appeal to the ballot-box, what was
lately the minority becomes the majority, the tables
arc turned ; and the late majority, being now the
minority, are subjected to the same evils that they,
when in power, inflicted. Thus, the above named
abuses arc shown to be inherent in the system,
and cannot be eradicated while it remains.
" The single district system does not, it is true,
insure the representation of minorities in proper
proportions; but it approximates as near to the
probability of such a result as any that can conveniently
be adopted.
44 Many have already expressed a determination
to treat the districting clause of the apportionment
law as a dead letter, and, if they arc returned to
Congress, to vote for the admission of meinlicrs,
not elected according to its provisions; and by the
vote of members thus admitted, to repeal it. If,
however, it can sustain the first shock of party,
combined with the very natural preference entertained
for the general ticket where that system
has prevailed, the State* will all acquiesce, and it
will become the law of the land.
44 To the south where it now encounters, I believe,
the greatest opposition, I regard its main
tonance to be of the last importance. To the
whole Union its maintenance is more important
than the question of whether the Whig or Democratic
doctrines shall prevail for a few years to
come in the National Legislature. The influence
of the one is temporary, of the other permanent."
Indeed, sir, the subjects admit of no compari.
son. It set ms, from recent events, that the most
unimportant of all considerations is the question
whether we have members here who arc nominally
Whigs or Democrats. If Whig votes are wanting
to carry a high protective tariff, the deficiency is
supplied by Democrats; and so far as the public
lands are concerned, let who may rule in Congress,
we are protected against their plunder as
long as the present Chief Magistrate sit* in the
presidential chair.
Mr. C. would now briefly reply to the argument
of the gentleman from Virginia, [Mr. Wise,] who
says that " each House taiiig, under the Constitutution,
the judge of the elections, returns, and
qualifications of its members," we have no right
to prescribe rules of evidence to apply to the organization
of a subsequent House, or to cases of
contested elections that may come before it.
Some believe that the House of Representatives
is in the nature of a corporation, constantly existing,
without reference to the particular members
who take part in its deliberations; and that the
language of the Constitution prescribing that each
House shall be the "judge of the elections, qualifications,
and returns of its own members," applies
to each House of Congress, instead of to each
House of each succeeding Congress. If this interorctation
is correct, the argument of the gentle.
man has less plausibility than it would have if the
language of the Constitution applies to each House
of each Congress.
Mr. C. admitted that he thought the last men.
tioned interpretation most correct. But let us ex.
amine the bill under consideration. What doce
it propose to do ? Docs it propose that ice shall
judge of the 44 elections, returns, and qualifica.
lions" of members hereafter to be elected ? Ccr.
tainly not. Such a proposition would involve an
absurdity. It simply proposes to proscribe rules
for the organization of subsequent Congresses, and
rules for the taking of testimony in casts of con.
tested elections that may come before them for
adjudication. Mr. C. would illustrate his position
by an example. The Constitution prescribes 4* that
the judicial power of the United States shall be
vested in one Supreme Court, and such inferior
l courts as Congress may, from time to time, ordain
and establish." Yet, in prescribing rules of testimony,
by irhich eases that come before these courli
are judged of, Congress does not decide upon tht
cases themselves, makes no encroachment upon
i the judicial functions, and is guilty of no usurpa.
I tion. Can the gentleman draw the distinction ?
| Not long after the organization of the Govern'
! ment, rule# were prescribed by law for the taking
j of testimony in cases of contested elections. Tli<
| first of these owed their origin to Robert Good lot
j Harper, then a member from South Carolina. Foi
| many years, no rules have existed, except such ai
I have been prescribed by the various committees o
I election, and approved by the respective Housei
' of Congress, after the cases to be decided havi
i arisen. Gentlemen all know the inconvenience
delay, and indeed the injustice, that arise fron
this state of things. Contesting members com<

their claims, from the extreme parts of the Union
Rulcc, for the taking of testimony are prts-Til?e<
after the cases arise. They return to their distant '
| States; are compelled to traverse extend e districts
; and the long session of Concert . 9 some(
times terminated before their cases arc decided.?
I A portion of the freemen of this country may, in
the mean time, not be represented at all; or, what j
is worse, they may be represented by a man whom 1
they have not lawfully chosen. Do not such evils ,
call loudly for a remedy ?
I Mr. C. regarded that portion of the bill which ,
i related to the organization of the House (although
far from the best that could he adopted) of great
j importance. It is in vain for gentlemen to say :
they will, if returned to the next Congress, resist !
i it, if it becomes a law. They (the constitutional I
| Representatives of a people, whose proud boast it J
j is to live under a government of laws) certainly do '
: not contemplate a resistance by violence. None |
I other is practicable, until after the House is or- !

1 may repeal the law ; but, until it is organized, the
; rules which it prescribes must of necessity have a
controlling influence,
i The confusion and disorder which prevail in
, this hall, at the meeting of every new Congress,
| must admonish gentlemen of the necessity of prescribing
for the organization of subsequent Congrosses.
When we assembled here, the Clerk of
the former House?acting without authority of
; law, and only in accordance to custom?read,
: from a list which he held in his hand, the names
. of two hundred and forty-two gentlemen, which
1 he had collected from newspaper paragraphs, hcar:
say, private letters, and 6uch other means as hap|
pencd to be within his reach. We answered to our
j names when called, proceeded to elect a Speaker,
j were sworn to support the Constitution, and bc|
came organized. Why did we submit to this
; loose method of organization ? Were we under
any obligation of law, or of the Constitution, to do
so ? No. But simply because there were no rules
proscribed for our government; and we submitted
j to this loose custom from necessity?silently pro|
testing, at the same time, in our judgments, against
; it. For the same reason, gentlemen elected to the
1 next Congress will he compelled to submit to the
| provisions of this bill, if it become a law, so far as
j the organizition of the House is concerned.
Although Mr. C. defended both the constitutionality
and the propriety of passing a law to pro- |
j vide for the organization of future Houses, and ;
: for the taking of testimony in eases of contested
j elections, lie did not expect to vote for the present
J bill. There were parts of it which lie did not ap'
prove, that were now not amendable. For example,
there is a provision in the bill which limits the
time of commencing a contest to thirty days after
the result of the election is known. We have no
authority to deny a gentleman the right to prose
J culc his claim on tins door, whenever it may doI
conic known to him that it exists. We have no
authority to establish a statute of limitations
against the right of the people to eject a member,
when they discover that he holds his seat by fraud,
I and is not truly their representative. '
