SERIAL JACKSOX IX NEW ORLEANS.
The reception of (Jeneral Jackson in
New Orleans, on the ever glorious 8th,
was one of tin*, proudest testimonials of
fervent honor and respect ever paid to any
hero or statesman in this country. In additiuirlu
what we have ahead) published,
wo give the following Irorn the New Orleans
Pica) nne.
"As ha-.j been previously arrange*), the
steamers bearing the venerable ex-President
arrived yesterday morning at about
];> oY'k. An immense throng assembled at
i.'ic wharf to welcome him, ami llie steamboats,
vosselsin the river, and house tops,
were alive with people waving their hats
and handkerchiefs as he approached.?
The old General looks somewhat the
worse for age, but is still remarkably active
and hearty for one of his years.
The reception, generally, was one of
which the aged veteran should feel proud.
There was a lukewarmarsS on the part of
some of his political opponents, which
we consider any thing hut praiseworthy;
but the body of our citizens were out, and
cordially welcomed the man who, in IS15,
manfully hiaved not only an almost unconquerable
enemy, but public opinion in
their behalf. We, in our individual capacity,
are among those who have politically
opposed General Jackson in (nought,
word, and deed?not eleventh hour men,
but went against his political advancement
from the first jump out?still, we

only of the man; welcomed him as the
"Hero of New Orleans" and the fearless
defender of his country, and were willing
to forget aught else.
On leaving the boat, a barouche with
four horses was ready to tccciie him,
from whence he was escorted, by the Legion
and Washington battalion, to the
State-house. As the procession parsed
along Canal street, a dense mass of citizens
thronged each side, and the numerous
balconies were groaning with thrir
fair huidetis?ladies waving their handkerchi'
is?while the silver-headed warrior
bowed in acknowledgment of their salutations.
From the State-house he was escorted
to the public square, in front of the old
cathrdral, by the veterans of 'II and '15,
the members of the Legislature, many
members of the City Councils, and a
large concourse of the citizens. Arrived
at ihe public square, he was conducted to
the cathedral, win re an oration was delivered,
alter w 1.iris he reviewed the troops
in the square, the cannonicrs meanwhile
thing a salute. This part of the ceremonies
over, iie was escorted to his rooms at
the Louis Exchange by the military,
after which they were dismissed.
Now Orleans has won some fame for the
brilliance of her military displays, hot tite
parade of yesterday exceeded any thine
of the kind we have ever achieved. All
feelings of rivalry were forgotten, and
the L; ?ion and Washington Battalion lamed
out in concert. We never saw iliem
look to more advantage than they did on
this occasion, and the light of other days
could be seen brightening in the old s<>|dirr's
eyes as he lontemplnted the fine
martial display before him. lie who had
ltd taw and undisciplined Tennessicans
and Louisianiuiis to battle and to victory,
from the same spot, now beheld a well
diillcd and disciplined array of troops,
and his pleased countenance fu?h indicated
his satisfaction.
In the evening, agreeably to the invitation
of the management, the General and
his suite attended the St. Charles. At the
close of the act of the comedy then performing,
the curtain \v?i dropped, and
the anthem played according to announce*
ir.cnt. The curtain then rose, and Mr.
J. M. Field delivered a poetical address,
from his own pen, to the Defender of .\ew
Orleans, the aged veteran who came
" To bless tbo children of the sires lie saved."
The house was crammed from the pit to
the dome, and the General tivice'arose to
acknowledge the enthusiastic cheering of
the multitude. Hail Columbia was then
sung by the full company of the St.
Charles, and the white headed warrior
left the theatre amid the prolonged cheers
of an admiring audience of some thousand
souls. Thus ends our brief and hastily
written record of a day that will be
remembered while New Orleans stands and
the Mississippi flows."

It appears that John Woodward,

quantities of Texan lands, to which he
hud net the shadow of a title, and that
these emigrants who had come out, 'had,

Truth.?The subjoined epilogue, beautifully
enforcing the utility and beauty of
truth at all times, has probably appeared
before in our columns. But such an article
can scarcely be published loo often:
"A Persian mother, in giving her son
. forty pieces of money as his portion,
made him swear Dever to tell n lie, and
. said, 44 Go tny son, I consign thee to God,
and we shall not meet again until the day
of judgment." The youth went awajr,
and the party he travelled with was assaulted
by robbers. One fellow asked'
what he bad got, and he said, 44Forty
dinars arc sewed in my garment-" lie
laughed, thinking he jested. Another asked
the same question, and got the same
answer. At last the chief called and asked
him, and he said, 441 have told two of
your people already, that I have 40 dinars
sewed up in my clothes." He ordered
the clothes to be ript open, and found the
n/niftf 4i Ami Lwi'iimf i-nn to tell this?"
!" Because," the child replied, " 1 would
no? he false to my mother, to whom I promised
never to tell a lie." "Child," said
the robber, " thou art so mindful of thy
duty to thy mother, at thy years, and am
I i (sensible at my age o( the duty I owe
rnv God? Give me thy hand, that I may
swear repentance on it." He did so; his
followers were all struck with the scene.
"You have been our leader in guilt" said
they to the ebief, " be the same in the
path of virtue;" and they instantly made
restitution of spoils, and avowed repentance
on the hand,"
Family Prayer.?In binding a family
together in peace and love, there is no
human influence like that of domestic
prayer. Uniting them in a common object,
it unites their sympathies and desires.
Raising their hearts to heaven, it
brings them altogether in the presence of
Itiod. The family altar is one to which
I.L ?_ ?l ? ?r i;r?

I has no holier spot than a house thus sancj
iitied by prayer; Where the voire of supI
plication and thanksgiving consecrates I
'every day; where the Word of God is devoutly

but it is holy, anil therefore heavenly.?
Poverty may he there, and sorrow, but
its inmates arc rich in faith, and peace,
and hope. Sickness may enter it, but
they will come as angels of peace and
mercy, and the spirit whom they release
from the imprisonment of the flesh shall
be united, free, and happy, to worship for*

ADVICE TO MEN IN DEBT.
Ascertain the whole state of your affairs.
Learn exactly how much you owe. B.
not guilty of deceiving yourself. You
tnay thus awaken suspicions of dishonesty,
when your intentions were far otherwise.
Deliberately and fully make up your
mind, that coinc what will, you will practice
no concealment, or trick, which might
have the appeuruncc of fraud. Openness
and candor command respect amongst all
good men.
Ilemctnbcr that no man is completely
ruined among men, until las character is
gone,
Never consent to hold as your own one
farthing, which rightfully belongs to others.
As you are at prescut in circumstances
of great trial and as many eyes arc upon
you, do nothing rashly. If you need advice,
consult only a few. Let them be
disinterested persons of the most established
reputation.
Offer frequent and fervent prayer to Almighty
God. If you have, by any fault
of your own, been brought into your present
embarrassments, humbly ask furgivenness
of God and hope in bis mercy.
Beware of feelings of despondency.?
Give not place for an hour to useless anil
enervating melancholy. Be a man.
Reduce your expenditures to the lowest
possible amount. Care not to ligurc as
others around you.
Industriously pursue such lawful and
honest arts of industry as are left to you.

TIIE MAILS. ' ,
As much complaint has existed on the (
part ot some of the Northern papers, in. ]
relation to the derangement of the mails, i
particularly those between Washington j
City and New York, we extract, from the ;
Correspondence of the Baltimore Republican,
the most brief and intelligible account
of the.causes, that we have seen.?
We perceive no jusl grounds lor me Diner
and violent abuse that has been heaped
upon the Post Master General, by some '
of the Whig presses, lor the course he
has pursued in this matter?or why the
Government has not equally as much right J
to pass an agent or baggage upon the Philadelphia
Rail Road, as a private individual.
Indeed, the Post master General
pursued the only course left hiin in the '
emergency, as the Company had refused
to carry any of the mails, unless paid upward
of >120,000 per annum more than the
law authorized him to give. To force the
Government to pay this exorbitant charge, '
was no doubt the cause of the denial to 1
its agent, and his baggage, of the com- '
mon rights of the traveller.
Since writing the above, we have read
the very interesting letter of the Post 1
Master General, to the Post Master at !
Baltimore, on this subject, and will endeavor
to publish it hereafter. 1
"In the year 1S38, Mr. Kendall, succeeded
in getting the mail carried from
Washington to New York, in about twen- '
iy hours?a despatch unexampled in the <
history of the travel of the world. Dy 1
this arrangement, the mail arrived at New 1
York, at a late hour of the night, and 1
could not be assorted till an hour in the 1
morning quite loo late, to render it ac- 1
ccssable to the morning Press. This was
unavoidable, and nothing but time could <
alter it.
At this juncture, the New York Courier
and Enquirer, and the Journal of
Commerce, in common wiih several other t
papers, petitioned Mr. Kendall for a re- <
mcdy; but, how a remedy was to be efTec-jt
tod. ihcv did not undertake to sav. The 11
Post master General, ever anxious to 1
| oblige the public, put his head to work to 1
discover how the evil could be remedied, f
At last, he hit upon apian. lie ordered i
i the making up of as "Editor's Mail," se- t
pa rated)' from all the rest, and gave in- f
structions that it should be assorted immediately
after its arrival in New York, thus r
enabling the New York editors, to get \
their Washington despatches in lime for i
their morning papers! r
This " Editor's Men7," was kept up. t
till the Philadelphia Rail Road refused to c
carry avy of the mails, unless it could <
spunge the public out of the sum of $50- \
000 per annum being upwards of $20,000
per annum more than what the Post c
Master General was allowed to pay by t
law! c
After the refusal of the Rail Road, to t
carry the regnlar mails, an order was is- c
sued, that the "Editor's Mail," should c
he carried through by a special agent via
the Philadelphia Rail Road; and the agent 0
who conveyed it, paid for its transporta- f
lion previously, as all other passengers t
pay for the transportation of their bag- j,
gage. i
The special messenger had not been a
employed in this way more than a couple ^
of days before he was slopped by the Rail t
Iioad, complaint being made to it, as is v
slated here, by some one attached to the ^
Baltimore Patriot. If this report be un- s
true, the editor ol the fatriot win dc piea-n.
sed to contradict it. For his credit's sake, | ^
I hope it is untrue." 8

THE HON. JOHN C. CALHOUN.
Time was when no man not a Pennsyl- j,
vanian, had a stronger footing in Pennsyl- n
vanin, than John C. Calhoun, the distinguished
statesman of South Carolina.? j
Bold and fearless in mind, vast and com- g
prehensive intellectual capacity, ardent in j
temperament, and close, keen, discrim- h
inating in judgment, with an eagle eye, ,
and more than a lion's strength and courage,
he is inferior to no individual of the
age in the elements of character which
constitute true greatness. Ilis doctrine ^
of Ntdlificalion, however, reversed his
standing in our Commonwealth. Yet not- S|
withstanding the prejudices conceived
from this source' against htm, the noble
and patriotic course of Senator Calhoun "
in relation to the leading measures of the a
General Government, his disregard of
,M-ttrii4n ??. nAi-ennal nnmiiip?. and his de
KW.OW.... -
votion to and advocacy of the best interests
of the country, and the sterling max- ^
iins and principles of Democracy, have in
a great measure again re established him
in the old confidence and popularity of 1
the community. He is a great man and
capable of great achievements. Ilis present
situation is filled with labor and difficulties
which would overpower and destroy
persons of less force and energy.? b
His personal and long standing controver- k
sy with Mr. Van Burcn arc well known; g
he has, nevertheless, from a controlling I
sense of duty, given a hearty support to r
the administration of Martin Van Buren; (
the Opposition, from this course, not be- p
ing able to appreciate his high and honor- a
able feelings and patriotism, attempt to ^
charge him with that kind of coalition's
iud bargain and sale which too): place be-14
ween Clay and Adams, and of which Mr. 1
21ay, together with Mr. Adams, was con- 1
'icted by the free suffrages of the people.
Sven Mr. Clay, on a recent occasiou, had ]
lie temerity to refer to such a coalition, 1
ind to nsk if he, Mr. Calhoun, had formal
such a one with Mr. Van Buren. Mr.
Dalhoun's reply was fraught with a mild
;andor and forbearing rebuke which should
jffeclually prevent all future aggressions
if tlip kind nn thfi nnrt nf Mr. Clav. and
jonvincc all the Clay and Harrison men
low useless it is to attempt to tamper with
the noble and inflexible Senator from
South Carolina.

hat in December, 1835. Tho loss is estimated at
irom one and a half to two millions of dollars. In
he articlo of Tea alone, wo loarn that a singlo indiridual,
lost upwards of half a million of dollars,
riio amount insured, so far as the facts have been as- f
.'crtaiucd, bears no proportion to the loss.
CONGRESS.
We congratulate our readers, and the country, on ;
he final adjustment, in the House of Representatives j
>f ihc abolition question; its adjuetniont too, on such j
i basis as must bo highly gratifying to the friends of j
lie South. The following resolutions offered by the
rlon. W. Cost Johnson, of Maryland, were adopted
>y a vote of 114 to 109, which put9 an end, at least
or tho present, to the congressional abolition wind- j
nills which have been in operation for a goodly por-1
ion of tho last nine weeks. The rcsolutinns ure as i
oliows, viz:
" Itcsoltsd, That, upon the presentation of any,
ncmorial or petition praying for the abolition of slo- j
cry or tho slave-trade in any District, Torritory or j
State of the Union, and upon the presentation ot any i
evolution or other paper touching that subject,,
he reception of such memorial, petition, resolution,
>r paper slvall be considered as objected to, and the
picstion of its foccption shall bo laid on the table,'!
vithout dobatc or further action thereon."
" Resolved, That no petition, memorial, resolution,
>r other papor, praying for the abolition of slavery in I
ho District of Columbia; or any Stato or Territory,
ir tho slave trade between the States or Territories ot"
lie United States, in which it now exists, shall be re- j
icivcd by this House or entertained in any way what
xcr."
Theso resolutions have been adopted as a portion j
if tho standing rules of the House, and cannot there-'
bro be altered, or rescinded, except by a vote of two
hirds, so that wo may expect, so far as this question
j conccrnod, no furthor agitation on the subject. The j
louse will now probably take up tho sub-treasury bill, j,
nd discuss it in good earnest. There seems to be no j
uestion but it will pass that body', but we do not'1
hink that it will bo disposed of so soon there, as it _ <
ras in tho Senate. The evidences which the mem- I ,
ers of the Houso havo given of thoir power to con-!,
umc time on questions, about which, there can hard- j
y be a difference of opinion among honest men, for-1 '
ids the anticipation, that this matter will get through 1
o soon as its friends hoped, and its enemies foarcd. i
The Senate has passed another very important bill
-providing for the establishment of a Board of .
Claims. Every ono who has looked overthc proceed-!
igs of CongTcas1 must have been struck with the , '
umber of claims which aro anuually urged for its !'
onsidoration, and which it is impossible fcr that bo. i I
y to examine with that caro necessary to the dispen-1 j
ation or justice to the country and to the claimants, j j
'arties having just claims against the government
avo had their politions yoar after year presented, uu-j!
11 they havo gonodown to their graves without jus. j
ice, and they have been renewed by their ropresen-11
ttives with just as slight hopes of success. The es-; |
lblislimcnt of this Board will tend to facilitate this ]
usincss, and as a consequence enable Congress to de- i1
patch the moro public and important business of the j1
ountry. j I
On Thursday the 30th ult. Messrs. Blair & Rives i
:cre elected Printers to the House. The vote stood ! (

Thus another question which has perplexed the j

GLEANINGS OF HUSBANDRY. s
The multiplication of papers in the Southern coun- (
y devoted to the interests of agriculture, in all its ,
ranches, argues a growing xasiu ior more general j
nowlcdgc on this subject, which affords the most j 1
ratifying evidence of the "march of improvement." !
t must lie admitted by every one, conversant with ! ]
ural affairs, that generally, the farmers of the South,
there are, of course, some exceptions) have not kept
aco with the spirit of the age, with reference to tho
dvanccmcnt making in the science of agriculture.I
Vo confidently hope, from the efforts of those enga- j1
ed in this uvefiil department 61 the press, such a! |
liffusioa of knowledge, as will successfully prevent
urthcr emigration of oar citizens, for the purpose
seeking more fertile regions.
We have been led to these remarks by noticing the
prospectus of a montliiy publication to moke its first j^B
ippearanco in March, in Augusta, Georgia, under the
title at tho head of this article. It is to contain six- V
teen quartopages, and furnished at one dollar per an-.'^^B
num, payable in advance. It is to be edited by Dr.
Moses Holbrook, formerly for a short time, a rcsident
of this place. Ilis taste for overy thing connect- rtj^H
cd with the various departments of agricultural pur-, -.j^B
suits, and his talents eminently fit him for discharg. ^j^B
ing the duties of Editor to such a paper as he prcqpr. <^B

A real Muxciiausenism.?Whon a man attempts

the following comes pretty well up to our idea of how -j^M
tho thing ought to be accomplished, if it is done at all. :
Captain Marryatt says, in his recent work: " The

We have received the January number of this pub- II

well established to require any thing from us by way fl
of commendation; yet we cannot forbear to express
our admiration of its many beauties. The style and

Among many other good things, we notice an article jU
on "Domestic Economy" from the pen of Mrs. S..J. x|

at tho head, we are led to expect a series upon
the same subject, which cannot fail to add greatly to 3fl
tho moral influence of the work. " Our Jessie, or ^
the Exclusiccs," by Mrs. Emma C. Emdurv, is beau.
tifully written and extremely interesting, and-what is 'fk
better, contains a most capital hit at the would-be ex- > 51
clusives, who are to be found, not only in the great

POU THE JOUHXAI..
Mr. Editor:?On Saturday evening of |
the 11th ult. I was present nt, and in a ||
meeting of the Town Council of the me- r.
tropolis of an adjoining district. The Intendant
had seen the sun rise and set, pre- ^
cisely at six of the clock, morning and eve- ^
ning, seventy times; aud more. lie had
lived all his days in that rapidly improving ^
and flourishing little town of the " Emerald
Isle." It grew up.; and now grows under ^
his charge ; not a stone laid; a hole filled ?
up; a hill cut down; a ditch cut; or a
bank raised; without his approval first had
and obtained; and it has prospered; and
continues to prosper; under his parental
guidance. (And that reflection is now the
softest pillow, that coaxes the old gentlenao
to sleep; that "covers him all over,
ts with a blanket" in his enjoying of that
refreshing invigorating" "invention ;*')
The other gentlemen composing the
Council; arc a Lawyer equal ot all points
:o any other of his age, in this highly taented
State; and two of the oldest, weal;hiest
and most respectable merchants of
he town, who like the "aged" Intendant
lad also "grown up with its growth, and
jtrangiliencd with its strength."
Alter dispensing some other business, en:irel)
local; and not necessary to be menioncd
here, except to prevent adruptness;
ind preserve the symmetry of my slatenent;
the Secretary read two letters, ona )
oy one; and one after the other; directed
To the Town Council"; each asking
hem to grant a license to the writer of it,
:o retail spirituous liquors in that town.
lie then read, in the same order, two
Dthcr letters with the same address; one
">ertaiuing to one; and other, to the other
lpplicant; each respectably signed by genlcmen
of the town, said every thing and
more in favor of the application it espoused,
and more than the law in such ctfses
requires- The bondsmen to each of the
tpplicants, an hundred fold more than amlie,
were also named and oflerred. .
It was moved and carried; that both applications
be considered and passed upon t
it one and the same time.
The Inlendant, then, holding np one application
in either hand, put the question?
'Shall these applications; or either of
:hem; be granted"??With one voice, (and
