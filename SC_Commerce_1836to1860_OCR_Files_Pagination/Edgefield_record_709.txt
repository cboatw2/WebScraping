The relation of master and servant has
subsisted among the buman famtiy from
an early period of the world; and Noah,
by the spirit of prophecy. foretold that
Uainan should be servant of servants unto
bis brethren, and the decree of Heaven i
cannot be disannulled. The Persians, the
Greeks, the Roman, the Jews. and otber
niations of antiquity had their slaves, and
which they obtained by conquest. or par- 1
ebased wuth their muoncy, or they were i
born in their houses; anal modern ntions,
speh as the English. the French and the
Spaniards have supplied their Colonies
With slaves; and the English refused to I
discontinue the trafie, when requested by I
her Colonies, while the trade was profita
ble ror her commerce; and by oppression i
sod taxation the majority of her own sub- i
jects are redaced to a state bordering on I
starvation. Millions of br oppressed I
subjects in India are in a worse situation -
than the slaves in t he United States. yet

our institutions in disturbing the peace aud I
harmony of our Governmetnt. I
The Governor of the world has made i
distitiction between the families of the
earth. The Caucain,. or white racc, is i
evi.deatly at the head of the humanlfamily. I
,rite structute of their bodies and .ner:y
of their miids places them above the oth
cr raees of men.
Tiae Seriptures of truth have sanctionid
the practice and prescribed rules for the
government of master and servant. .

It would have given me vrry sincere

ith all the contermpt iitnmerit-u. The P.

ollnwing cotmmernt:
"Yesterdav's Whiz contained the fad

hat the ceditor of the Whig haul no intimna
innt that the "Ploz" was a hoax, anal it is
vel known that after at first trying~ to
augh it over, he at length grew serious,
mtd expressly anal folly justified the 'Plot.'
f so, whatever may be thought by the
tommounity of Mr. Pleasants for triliig

his lionx plot hans involved the Whig ini

Mr. Editor :-Various reporis have
gone abroad through the upper poortion o(

hio been, and still is, at this time, very
sickly ; that. at one time, there were seven -

ver; in short, so far have those reports
gone. that parsons travelling by stage,from
Greenville to Cuhlmizia, have really been
apprehetisive that it would be unsafe toi
remain in the Village during even one
iight. This was tie fact, in relation to
Mir Wa. Gilmore Sinns. who passed
ihrough the place a hewv cvcnings since.
hen r. ports of this character are in
circulation, respecting the Village in which
we live, we feel bound to contradict them,
it is true that the D)istrict has been. and
stll i, -ickly ; but with regard to the I'd.
a which, within its corpoirae liniis,
contains upwards of 700 inhilaitant,. we
state that there has been, and is now les,
of fever that has prevailed, in any year,
for the last ivo years. So far is the re
port of the sickness of 31r. Scott's family
from heing true, there hias not been a sin
gle cawIa eelf fever since the first of Jluly.
Our Village has never been more health)
than iltrtug this summner ; and to the Vil
lage in which we live. .'e feel that it is ne
ressry to make this statemeat, thus public
ly ; anl we trtat that those paper-s nhich
