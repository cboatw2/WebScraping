- LETTER NO. II.
Tni, UNIoN iN 1790, 1845 AND 1900.
Mr. Editor:
- How inscrutable are the ways of Provi
dence! There Is scarcely a moment in the
day, but what an opportunity for deep anc
solemn reflection presents itseff to the re
flecting mind-scarce an occurrence how.
ever trifling, but what will be found, if we
trace it step by step as it glides slowly
along in the path of time, a connect
ing link to a great chain that may end it
one of those extraordinary convulsions thal
so frequently revolutionize whole nations,
and sometimes entirely change the physical
and moral condition of man. These re
flections were forced upon me on entering
Hamburg.- Before me lay a neat, flour
ishing little town. Here a row of newly
finished building" reared their lofty heads.
There stood a row of ueat brick stores,
looking as if conscious how much they add
:o the beauty of the town. The streets
were filled with Wagons, some unload
ing their valuable staple, others taking in
their groceries, and other necessaries. All
was life, and animation.
This town which carries on an immense
trade, owes its existence to a trivial quarrel
between the citizens of Augusta and a pri
vate individual, who to avenge himself,
resolved to build a town on the opposite
shore, which he knew woiild greatly cut
off their trade. Accordingly, he in a sin
gle night erected a number of houses,
which laid the foundation of Hamburg.
But why wonder that a quarrel should
lead to the erection of a town ? Does not
history abound with numerous instances of
less trivial causes having produced greater
results? The exclusion of the Angustines
from the selling of license to commit
crime, incensed Luther against the Roman
Church, and fitally produced the refor
niation.
A pegjarlbtw~ntad-e
at ihCourt of St. James, led Bolintgbioke
to make separate treaty between Queen
Ann and Louis XIV, which treaty brought
on the peaco 6r Utrecht. and all its con
sequences. Had not a lady of Paris
splashed her stockings on a certain morn
ing. probably Robespierre would have ne
ver been on the stage of action in France.
There would have been no reign of terror,
and Napoleoft .would not have worn a
crown or *ielded a sceptre; and a tax on
Tea ended' in the politicatl independence of
a Nation, and convinced the sceptic world
that that nation in which the people is the
source of power, aan alone make rapid
strides to power and prosperity. To be
convinced .of this, it is but necessary te
compare our progress with that of the Eu.
ropean po*crs for the last sixty years.
Rapid indeed, have been their strides, bul
only at a suale's pace, when measured by
the standard of ours.
Scarce seventy yeari have elapsed since
we, as an insignificant republic, took out
position in the rank of nations. It waa
then confidently prognosticated,'lay sage
philosophers, that we must sooni crumblk
into dust by our own ponderous weight.
Sadly ha'de they been mistaken! An all.
wise Providence has zealously watchec
over our interest, and seems to havo se
lectty this glorious land, in which to plani
the tree of liberty. Here doea it flouriut
most vigorously. The time is not far dis
tant, I trust, when the branches will taka
root ia every land, and-tyranny-and des
potism; which shackle the'natural energy
of man, will be known but by name.
-From the glorious night on which th<
immoatal Washtington, with his. small bu
gallanat army, re-crossed the Delaware
anad abe British lion first crouched to thi
American eagle, our Star has been ot
the ascendnnt, and now it is pointed at a
a constellation of the first magnitude. it
1790 we scarce numbered 4000,000 inhabi
tants, now we exceed 20.000,000 W:
hanve built a host of towns and cities, man:
of which can vie with the largest and mons
prosperous of. Europe, in every respect
Our country is crossed by more than fif
teen thousand miles of Rail Road, and fiva
thousanid miles of Canals-and on tha
whole, seems as if-called into existence by
the conjurers magic wand. Our g altan
navy has twvice defeated the sell'callec
Queen of the ocean, and now the "Sta
Spangled Banner" tvaves triumphant it
every Sea. Our mnerchant-ships are ti
be met with in every clime-in the frozet
ocean of the north, or in the torrid zone
and ouir ingenuity, industry and perseve
ance bids fair to drive England from ev
ry. m.rke, of the world. I dothibt
W ashington, Jefferson or Franklin, even
in their most sanguine expectations, con
templated for their posterity an advance
so rapid, so brilliant. But great as our
power undoubtedly is, let us remember
that ;e are as yet in our infancy. What
will it he, when we shall have grown to
vigorous manhood? What country on
the face of the earth enjoys the advantages
we do ? With the Atlantic on the East,
the Pacific on the West. the Lakes on the
North, and the Gulf of Mexico on the
-South, we may be possessed or numerous
fine harbors, and rnonopolizo the com
mrce of the world. With a soil that
yields the productions of every clime-the
valley of the Mississippi, alone, (if prop
erly cultivated,) would yield grain sulli
cient to supply the whole earth. Cotton,
tobacco, rice. flax, hemp, sugar, wine and
indigo are abundantly produced, and even
dye-stulTs, coffee, spices and silk could be
profitably raised in our Southern regions.
In time, (and that not far distant.) we will
largely manufacture cotton, silk, woollen,
and linen goods, and supply every market
with those articles.
The bowels of our soil are teeming with
immense beds of copper, iron, lead, coals.
granite and gold. These immense hid
(len treasures will be brought to light and
exported to foreign port. Salt, lime and
valuable timber are othe.r sources of our
wealth. Soon we must monopolize the
trade of China and India, which must
pour into our channels from the gorges of
the Rocky Mountains.
Oh! could 1 but live fifty or sixty years
hence, when this country will contain more
than a hundred -millions of inhabitants,
-when gur coasts will 'swarm with
populous cities, and this country, (from
North to South, and from East to West,
including Texas and Oregon, which will
and must come into our possession,) will
be as one enire great garden. .
Myriads or towns iill spring up in the
interior. Where now stands the lonely hut
ewil n n -a .viaesad i t
fnow is a sequestered villae will be a
magnificent town, crowded with facto
vies, with warehouses and with palaces.
In thousnud and ten thousand of places
where now the lofty pine or :he venerable
oak reigns supreme, will be found the hab
itation of man. Not the rough primitive
but of the backwoodsman, nor the small
though neat frame building, but the com
modious brick dwelling, the construction
of which has exhausted the ingenuity of the
architect. Rail Roads and Canals will
cross and re-cross the whole country in
every d' :tion. Our ports will be crow
ded with sit -ping, our interior towns with
factories-our commerte will extend to all
nations and every clime, and we will leave
all rivals far behind. To contemplate
our future condition, requires a stretch or
the imagination, and is above my power
to describe. England indeed forseen out
destiny, and her danger. She rears the
effulgency of our star mighi eclipse her.
She knows the industry, ingenuity and
perseverance of the American people. Site
knows our resources, and is straining ev
cry nerve to dounteract our rapidly increa
sing power. The weapons she employs to
accomplishi her object, I might makge the
subj.ect of my next letter..
Yours, &c. J

MISOELLANEOUS.
From the.New York Journal of Commerce.
THE TAX OF PROTECTION.
We stated some days ago, that we had
obtained from an importer a sample of
yard wide bleached cotton shirting, pur
chased by him in Manchester, at seven and
a quarter cents a yard, including exchange
at ten per cent. and that in quality the ar
ticle was equal to the New York Mills
shirtings of the same width, which the
manufacturers were sellitig at fourteen
cents a yard. We also -slated that sam
pies of these goods might be seen, side by
side, at our office, together with a sample
of American ctto is costing eight cents, or
about the saie -price with the English.
These three simpoles have been compared
by a great nimber of manufacturers and
merchants. The circumstance has ejici
ted much debpte, an.J a good many care
less and eveni arsh assertions from the
Tariffpapers. Withour enumerating these,
we will simply; lay before our- readers a'
statement of the,facts.
Fitst, Thenthhre is neither on our part,
nor on that of ikf-tnporter, any decep'ion
or false appealance in any particular.
The goods purchased in Manchester were
purchased.in the regular course of mercan
tile business. hey were riot refuse goods,
nor old goods, InIr "an odd lot. They were
not made of India cotiori and pulverizei
spar, nor had they anything about them
peculiar. Theywere ordered and made
in the usunl way. and at the usual price,
and any further quantities of them can be
procured at the same price. By the glass
they count 80 t fireads by 96.
Secondiy.- The importation of these'
goods at so loiy a price. is no new"thing.
They have infact been imported all along,
costing, until renily, -only 99. t 10s. a
piece, instead of i2i. id., rihil ias paid
for these. The present import6r hi beed
in the practice bf buying them here at
15 cti. and selling them at 17 1 2 Cte.
The advance in England was stich di to.
take them cost just 15 ets. laid down
here, which caused the former importers
to abandon them, and the jobber was oblig
ed to import them for himself.
Thirdly. the goods were not bought in
England with any referenre to this devel
opement, nor with any reference, to any
thing but the profit of the business. The
developementis the result of a casual-con
Fourv/dy. The cotton of which the New
York Mills goods are made. is " fully fair
New Orleans " or - Mobile," and the ra-v
material of the -English article is appa
rently the same. . The raw material for
neither of them, at present prices, costs
more than two cents a yard, as a pound
of the cotton costs but eight cents, and
makes four yards of the cloth. Cavillers
may perhaps say that the raw material
costs two and a half cents a yard. Let it
bd "deemed and taken " to be so.
Fifthly. The weight of the two kinds f
goods ivery exactly the same, boih weigh
;ng within two ounces of 22 1-2 lbs. the
100 yards.
Sixthly. The English article is as good
for wear as the American, f'r we' know
gentlemen who have worn both.
Screnthly. We are now prepared to say
that the English article, taking its quali
ties in the aggregate, is better than the
American, and gaios in the comparison by
washing. This is proved by the opinion
of dozens ofjndges, includin- manufactu
rers and TarifT ren in lairge num'bers,
who, when the washed samples have been
put into their hands, have pronounced al.
most unanimously in favor of the Man,
chestei sample, declaring tihat the best.
TIe fact that the English article has sold
andI is now selling at 17 1-2 cents in com
petition with N9ew York Mills goods at
14 1 2 cents side hy side, is proof enough'
of their superiority for all mercantile pur
poses.
Upon these seven declarations of tabts,
we beg our readers who are disposed or
evetn willing ta admit imple truth, to mark
it down in their minds thai the regular
manufacturers' price for fne cotton falkiits
in Iisogland is not m'ore than half the price
whi'ch is paid to American m'anufacturers,
for goods of equalquzality.
Theta are some other facts intimately
connected with these things, which -are
worih filingin mind.
I. Th'~ ab'gnufacetufera in Manchester
are making money very tapidlj, at the
prices which they now obtain. & gentle
man of Njw York, or'great experience,
and an eairsest'defender of the iaiifwhen
at home, wrote a letter to' his friend in
this coumiry by the tift steamer, in whidh,
speaking of the prosperous con'diti'on of
the manufacturers, he says "there are
more than'an hundred establishments in
Manchester which are clearing twenty-five
thousand poutids each (Sl20,000) a year."
We read the letter ourselves. This fact,
and another, that the Englishmeh- are
butilding now factories and enlarging their
operations, is proved by the foIl6wing-ar
ticle whichwe-cut from Wildmer & Smith's
Liverpool Times of September 4th.
"sTATS 0? TRADE IN MANCHESTER.
We extract the following from Messrs.
lu'N,sir, Greenhow, and Irving's circular
The excitement, attended by an impor
tant advance upon some of the articles, so
general .at the date of our last Circular, is
passing away ; and the goods in question,
as you will learn from the details, are re
ceding fasr to the r-ates current previous
to the last movement. -Our conviction,
'some time ago expressed, that high grices
-relatively considered-cannot again rule
penrmanently in this country, becomes
gradually strengthened. With such an
immense productive power as we already
possess, and the fact of an early and con
siderable accession to that power, by the
erection of several new.mills. in most of
the main cotton-manufacturing localitiei,
con'firm u' in the belief that ii is utterly
impossible to force iti products beyond a
legitimate value.
The business of the month has beei of
a very extensive character; and, notwith
standing that matters have within the last
fortnight, assumed a much .uieter aspect,
there is nothing in their present appear
ance calculated to weaken our previous
and present impressions, that the state of
trade has been, and continues to be ex
ceedingly healthy.
The home irade, ihough not at present
very active, is very satisfactory. The au
tumin business will, if we mistake not, ex
ceed considerably that of some years past.
We write, of course, in anticipation, it be
ing yet too early to form a conclusive &pin
ion.
From our correspondents in Leeds, IIud
dersfield, Helifax, Bradford, and other pla
ces, we continue to receive unequivocal
proofs of the continuance of decided in
provement.
At its present value, and the rates real
ised 'oth for goods and yarns, spinners
and manufacturers are undoubtedly doing
very well.
Domestics-The advance upon the low
qualities. noticed in our last Circular, is
sustained,--scarcely, however, to the ex
tent then prevalent. They are still scarea.
The middling qualities, whicha are also
very scarce, maintain easily the advance
upon them. In the best iakes; we per
ceive no material change.
Cotton goods can be riaritifactured as
ihedrilj in this edunry as in England. A
great manufacurer in. Boston, and advo
cate of the protective policy; who had
beed Much in England, wrote several years
agd a series of articles f-.otie'ofthe'Bos
ton newspapers, proilog that thete was iio
essential difference in the rages of labor,
betrween this country and Engldnd. La
bor is -paid in some cases less by Me day
in England, but thiedless is dccotmplished.
From all that we can learn, our judgment
is, that a given quantity of labor can be
procured Fdr as little morney here, as in
England, cunning, faithfulness, honisty,
number ot houses, and especially the bad
ef'eet of trades unions. We do n'tc believe
that in th' matter of Ildbor the Englishman
hasrey ssetiladaanssaa
glishman has the great diSadvantnge of
being coiipolled to pai'.six per ceiit duty
on his raw cotton, with double freight, afd
other expenies of irriportation. His only
advantage is in a less rate of interedt for
money, and a-freer trade in all foreign or
ticles which he iiishies to use., such as
iron, paints, &c. Building musi be as
cheep here as in England. . Water poner
is rather preferable to sieatm. Take it all
in all, the maunfacturer in the U. States
btands fully on a par with the manurac
turer in England. fHe has the advantage
in this market, offifteen per cent. charges
on importation, so that with the duty fixed
by the Corripromise Act. he ouIld have
thirty-five per cent advantage. Goods
costing seven and within cents in Manches
ter, would be ten cents when laid down
heie. This large protection our manufac
turers might enjoy.. withocit controversy.
That this is so, is proved by th.e fact fiat
American cotton gonds manufactured in
Lowell were sent to England a year or tnd
ago, paid the English duty, and yet sold at
d piofit. Otir goods compete successfully
with the English in afl parts of the w'rld ;
and even the British troops in India are
clothed in Massacbusetti "drills." Large
p'tircirases of brown goods have recently
been rmade in Bostory, for shipment!, so that
a letter from a great ho'uie there says thiis
demand will probably prevent prices from
receding further. It must be noticed,
however, that the goods exported sire
heavy,-quite unlike the esamples wbich
we have eifhibited. All goods ate a good
deal cheaper in England than here, and
for a large portion of those carried to Chi
sa, our own ships proceed to England for
cargoes.
2. The Enghi.-h manufacturers are at
this time keeping the markets which they
6Gad, and recoverin'g what they had lost to
our countrysnen in past years. They have
also, within~the last two years, gone be
fore es in those departments in which w~e
had attained.equality.
2. Th'e English manufacturers are all
Free Trade-men,having become thorough
lyconvinced that Free.Trade is essential
to their success. There is not now an ar
tie of British amanufactore which iR pro
tected. A great manufacturer in Manches
ter said recently .to a friend ofo'urs, "lse
lorig as Frich calicoes were shut oui,-we
were affaid of them; but when they were
let in and wve saw theeri, an'd were obliged
to co-npete with them, we did it with suc
cess.." This'is their geaneral tone, and they
are engaged in a great and determined
warfare against the remnants of protec
tion which still remain in their laws, as
applicable to agricoltural pursuits.-'
4. We have other satmltes-of English
manufactitres which showv e greater dif
ference in prices even, than these which'
have msade so much'conversation.' We
shall bring them forward.dhirectly.
2. The capit al and -labor of our country.
under the inafuence of the present Tariff,
is rushing into aisaufactures with fearful'
rapidity. Five millions have thus been
invested in Massachusetts recently, and
the machine makers have for months past
been engaged for eighteen months ahead.
The demand for manufacturad goods is
rapidly enlarging, in our country nnr thro'
the world. . Still *e predict inat it fthe
present Tariff continues five years longer,.
it will bring about a revolution among
manufacturers which will -scatter their
present unnatural profits to the winds; at
least, in the case of many of theim. Good
statestiduship and true .patriotism would
desire to dvdid the repetition or isch disas
Lastly; Thi reisson why cotib' j:ods
have advanced all over the worla, is that'
the commercial i drdldi just corniout of
a general collapse. The reason ;why thli
advance has been much greitir in .this
countrj than lse've're,.sli that tha tranu
factureis are inaking such eitoritoui pr6fti,
(Mr. Marshall excepted,) is, that the com
promnise act adop'ted -in .1833.hctdeied'
people cdutious of building fac'ories. The
increase wias not equal to the. ncrease'of
our population. We expected acinoie'-u.
ance of free trade, when.'suddenly, (and
most inproperly. and unfortunatily,. ve
think, for all interests,) ihe ababdohinl
policy was restored in the worst exirems.
