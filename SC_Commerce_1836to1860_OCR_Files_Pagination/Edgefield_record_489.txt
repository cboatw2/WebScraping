Extracts from " A Brief Review, of some of
the points in the L'Anistad Case."
The case of the slaves taken in the Am
istad, from Haana, and the circumstances
under wbich the district judge decided that
they were not slaves either under the
Spanish law or our own, is one of the
deepest importance to the Southern States.
When we reflect upon the important prin
ciples that England has recently pronul
gated to the world in the case of the brig
Enterprise, and also upon the proceedings
of the recent couvention, held in London,
from different nations, on the subject of
emancipation, connected with the mad and
reckless movements upon the same sub
ject in our own country, no man who is
conversant with passing events can fail to
be deeply impressed with anxious solici
tude for the future. Many are so absorbed
in the party contests of the day, that they
seem to have forgotton that they have a
country, and that she has been wounded
in her most vital interests. The day was
when movements that have taken place
at home and abroad, within the last few
years, upon these great and delicate inter
ests, would have caused the swords of a
hundred thousand freemen to trcniblc in
their scabbard.. My present object is to
call the cool and dispassionate attentiion of
the refleting portion o: the (ommunitv to
the priuciplos involved in the case of't he
Amistad, in which an appeal is now pend
ing before the Supremne Court of the Uoi
ted States.
The facts of the case seem to be, that
the Amistad is a Spanish vessel, and nas
regularly cleared frtn Hlavana, in Uuba,
to Greanajah, near Puerto Principe, au
other Spanish port. 11cr papers were all
regular, and signed by the proper ollicers;
her cargo consisted cf merthandize and
slaves, was duly manifeste(d as belongintg
to Don Jose Ruiz and Don Pedro 3lutttes;
that the negroes after being at sea two or
three days, rose Upon the white persons on
board ; that the captain, his slave, and two
seamen were killed, and the vessel taken
possession of by the negroes; that the two
white Sparninrds, after being wounded,
were compelled to assist in navigating the
vessel, the negroes intendin-1 to carry her
to the coast ofAfrica ; that the two Spnti
iards contrived, by alteriug the course of
steering at night, to keep her on the coast
of the United States ; that on seeing land
off new York, they came to that coast.
On 'he 26th of August, 1839, Lieut. Gcd
ney, commanding the brig Washington, of
the United States Navy, seized and bro't
into the port of New Loudon, the Aminstad
and cargo, and all the persons on board,
fbr examination, and such proceedings as
the law of nations and of the U. States,
warranted and required.
The first question that presents itself is,
should the negroes be considered as prop
erty ? The court below has said they
should not. Coartesy, and the intercourse
of all civilized nat ions, require that the
forms and papers of all authorized officers
in one country, shall be respected and re
ceived in the tribunals of another. With
out this, there must be perpetual confu
sion and just ground of complaint between I
nations; and instead of hartuony.and mu
tual respect, the reverse must take place. t
herever jurisdiction is delegated to a i
public oflicer, and confined only by his
discretion, all acts within that discretint
are to be recognuized as bitnding; and this
is trtte, whether the act be judicial, legis- I
lative. or executive. Without this, the 1
code of interniationail law, by which thte
peace and intercourse of nations are pre
served, would grcdually fail into disuse,
and the strongest maritime ptower woul I
sweep into its exclusive jurisdiction all ca
ses whatever. In this case, the negroes
in question were all particularly named in
the permit and clearance given to Ruiz
and Montes, who held them as property itt
Havana, and the vessel and her port of
destiny all dlescribed and properly authetn
ticated by the legal officers in Cu ba. Theset
facts are not questionedl.
if there wvere anything wrong in this,
and against the laws of Spain, and if the
authorized officer did tnot do every thitng
he may have dotne, then that ,v as a case
for the tribunals of' Spain to decide upon,
and not ours. If. the negroes were not
slaves under the Spanish law, t hat was anti
issue to be madle up there. and decided by 1
their courts, and not ours. Stuppose ai
Spanish judge, with his arbitrary powers,
had recognised thte negroes to be slaves,
by a decree, and yet, uder the accidenial
jurisdiction of the district court of Conntec
.tiut, on collateral issues, our judge had
looked behind that decree, and dlecidced
they were not slaves, because the Spaish
law did not authiorize them to bie slaves.
then what woul it be lbut exercising, in
effect, apl>ellat e jurisdict ion over~ Spanish
tribunals.' The arrogance of such pre
tension would intevitably, if carried out in
our decisions, dcstroy all national inter
course, andl finally involve us iin war, for
violating the law of nations. And yet, if
our courts can look behind the legal pa
pers, properly autheniticated by one class
of oflicers, why can they tnot, upon the
same principile, luok behind the papers of
all others ? Under such a principle and
precedent, a schooner, with her regulaur
papers from the proper officers nf the port
of New Haven, might lhe seized ontt and
condemned, tunder a prize or adtnirahty
court of a foreign power, because, forsooth,
her cargo had been putrchased and she had
cleared on Sunday, and they had judged
that it was against the law of Contnectiett
to sail on Sutnday, or for her cargo to be
purchased otn that day Otn this subject,
the law of nations is the law of common
sense and common coutrtesy. Hlowever
much we may disapprove of the customs
of ferign officers or their acts, we cannot,
in the arrogance of our self-sttperiority,
assume a supervision and jurisdiction in
compatible with the separate intdependence
of nations, and that intercourse which has
been regulated and fixedl by ntational law.
In the case of the negro who had con
cealed himself on board the American ship
Elias Burget, that sailed from the islantd
of St. Croix on the 25th of June, 1822;
after landing in Newv York, the minister of
Denmark made a detmandl for the slave,
as the property of a Dantish subject. This
was a case where the slave was broughit
ofl without the ktnowledge of the captain,
by concealment in thte hold of the vessel
tad, the slaves were forced in openly by
United States oilicer. Yet in the Danis
case, Mr. Wirt. then Attorney General
the United States, used this strong lat
guage:
" Denmark does not tolerate slavery
St. Croix; and any attempt oi the pa
of the United States, or the individual ci
izens thereof, under the sanction and prc
tection of their Government, to interfl
with the Danish regulations in this respec
would be an invasion of the sovereigni
of Denmark, und, if avowed and unre
dressed on our part, ajust cause of wa
To take away the slaves from the posses
sion of theirowners, whether by seductiot
invitation, connivance, or ignorance an
mistake, affected or real ; to bring them t
the United States, and to refuse to retur
them to their owners, on the call of thei
Government, would be such a violation<
private property, such a lawless infrac
tion of the rights and sovereignty, as i
expose us to the just resentment of thn
nation, and the merited reproach of a
the civilized world. We have, in m
opinion, just as much right to order ou
national ships to unfurl the banner of free
dom among the slaves of all the West In
dia Islands, and proclaim insurrection an
liberty among them, as we have to detai
this single slave."-Pub. Doc. H1. R. No

name of his Government. and as its ac

h of our owii country. Tj point is beyoud
if all controversy. Underne treaty of 1795, t
i- slaves are to be consided as merchan
dise in law. Thi treatis the law of the
0 land, and every tribunal bound to carry U
rt out its spirit and intent io whenever a case fi
t- arises. After an officialemand has been L!
o- made by the minister oSpain, and the 1
C regular ship papers, prorly authentica

y have been presented, is itarrying out the c
spirit of the treaty to raii and decide the
abstract right of propert under the local
laws of Spain ? Is it r-ht to deprive a s
i, Spanish citizen, under d~panish flag, of
I the privilege of making t> his issue as to p
a the final rights of propery beftore the tri- I
n bunals of his own county ? Was it the- (
r intention of the treaty toarce the citizens n

dates of that blind faiaticism, which
prompted the judge upon the bench to de
clare int his decree, in refirence to one of
these negroes, that, "although lie might he

in vain for Africa;" and al! becanse his
hands were reeking with the blood of mur
dered white men I! Jt is a base outrage,
(I can uise no milder langtage) upon all
the sympathies of civilized life.
It is time that the white raco of the
Southern States should be alive to the re
lations they bear towards their fellow men:
in other regions. When the first move
m nts were made in Great Britain towards
emancipation in her West Indies, it was
thought to ho the idle and visionarydreams
or theorac..- ,-5 ---U.i.
..., .. rvaung-oartured
tntil it held a checking ppwer over the
British cabitnct, and was satisfied with no
thing short oif its demtands. Eveni now,
wielded as it is bty O'Connell, lashed into
the fury and phrenzy of blind phanaticism,
it holds uinder its sway a weak cabinet,
ibreed to court and allay it by mintistering
to its base antd diepraved appletite. Hlav
inig carried its mecasures at home, it now
looks, in the arrogance of its power-, for
objects abroad, upon which to exhaust its
pharisaical charity. WVhile the piublic
ment of Great Britaitn exult in ravaging the
fairest regions of Asia, attd reducing three
huttdred millions or human beings to the
most abject slavery on earth; whilst they
have gloated ror ages c ver phnuder and mnur
(letr in those vast regions through whic~h
the Gatnges sweeps, they, at the same time,
whine, in the drivelling hypocrisy of mod
ern times, over the hard fate of the slave
in Amnerieti. ller whole arnd final ohject1
is to strike at the source of our power as a
nation destined to be hereafter her gr-eat
commercial rival in the wvorld. The pro
ductions of e'dave labor furnish us our vast
resources int commerce, antI are the basis
or our- powert abrond. To strike at stave1
labor, is to strike at our power. If she
prosttates it by a ppeinig to the htypocrit
ical sympathies of tlhe world, she strikes<
as eff'ectual a blow at us, as her rival, as if
she had sacked our cities and ravaged ontr
- coasts by wvar. Her aim is power, andi
- she hats ever been bent on obtaining it, ei-.
their by force or by fraud. She holds thei
Sliteratuire of the English language in heri
. hands; and she can appeal to the religious
Ssympathies of those who speak that Ian-i
,guage, with more certain rower than by
an appeal to arms. It is uander these views
Sandi feelings thtat a minister of Great Brit
itin hats recetntly declared, in the sickly
,cant of modetrt dutplicity, that she will no
slonger recognise in us "the right of prop)
erty itt p~ersonts." (Case of the brig En
s terprise.) Let her get possession of Cuba,
. and she holds the exposed coast of Florida
at her ntercy.
e itt fortmer times, the great contest wvas
e to secnre the private rights uinitdividuals
e in society. In modern times, the great
s struggle is to preserve the separate indepen
1. dence of different communities. The powJ1
-.or of the " Holy Alliance," and the prin
|ciples spriniging from its counctils, together
rwith the interested ties of commerce,
I. have botund all christetndott iethter in one
i consolidated ccmunity ; atnd, tuless the
v destiny of events be atrrested,thie time will
ni come wheni the liberty ofithecitizens will
fg sink under the ptostrated independence of
~, the nation. If the municipal law, or local
-tribtinals of one nuatiotn, can mnodify or al
.. ter the law of nations, by declaritng in what
- property shall not consist with us, then
e every oilier nation can modlify upon some
e other point, and the result must be that we
s shall finally be dlrive~n into a state of uni
d versal war, or sink down inito the eter
le nal peace of a drivelling and dishonored
iI nattion. with neither the spirit aor the pow
it er to defend our independence. If it be
's true that " there can be no proper-ty in per
ysons." becatise they are considered as bu
,- man, thet those natiotns that bow down
4, atnd wrorshiip some of the brute creatiotn,
s. have the sante right to declare that prop.
-e ertv shall tnot constst to them, because they
iave divne attributes. They are inde
endcnt, and have as much right to alter
lie law of nations, as Great Britain has. 0
# i 0 f
In our intercourse with nations, the only e
rue rule to lie observed is, to preserve our c
3reign interests, and leave local institu
ions to be sustained or abolished by the a
ical tribunals in each country.
Thedecision recently made in the case s
r the Amistad indicates base subservien- c
y to British feeling and British interests.
Lod, if they can succeed in organizing a
World's Convention," as they are plea
ed to call it, nnd get our people to join
hem, they will finally succeed in using a r
orion of our confederacy to break down c
Fie power of the Union, and thus secure to I
Ireal Britain her darting object, perma- r
ent ascendancy upon the ocean, and the s
rost rat ion of her only rival, this great and u
lorious republic.
Under proper application from the Span
ih minister, the negroes in this case ought
udoubtedly to be given up under the tree- t
y of 1795. The questions as to the 5
ieaning of certain Spaish words, and
thether they were slaves or not under the
Ipanish law, ought to be left to Spanish
-ibunals. We have confidence that the
1upreme Court of the United States will e
o its duty, withoutfear, favor, or affection.

the idea of sending a mere charge to Mexi

EDGEFIELD C. H.
THURSDAY, MARCH II, 1841.
We are indebted to the lon. John C. Cal
houn, and the Hon. F. W. Pickens, for various
Public Documents, Papers, &c.
I We have received the Inaugural Address
of President Harrison, but it was too late
for insertion in- ibis week's paper. We
will lay it beford our readers at the earliest
possible date.
ofCouon.-The latest accounts of the state
iof he Foreign markets, as brought by
the Steam Ship Brittania,'at Boston, are
highly favorable. Although prices bve
advanced but slightly, yet there was an
t increased demand, by manufacturers, and
t the tnarkets-were firm.
* This news, however, has had little or no
elfect, to raise the price in our markets,
e and we can attribute it only to the want
e of money, among purchasers. Indeed, we
scarcely recollect the time, when our busi
ness men and merchants, have been so
drove as at the present. A determination
s is manifested by them, however, to extri
s cate themselves from their difficuIes, and
ascertain the true state of affairs. As an
instance, of the heretofore unparalleled
pressure among creditors, we are informed,
that upwards of six hundred cases for debt,
have been docketed for trial, at the ensu
ing Spring term, of the Court of Common
Pleas, in thiq District; besides an unusual
ium her of judgments confessed. We also
learn, that the same spirit prevails in the
e adjoining Districts. Whether this wil o1 pe
t rate, for the benefit of those engaged, and
a the community at large, remains to be de
, cided. That there has been a diaposition
exhibited, by many, todelay the settlement
of their dues, is a self-evidens-hme4jlih
'-must be accounted tor, either lbrthe want
of means, or a disposition to make suitable
r amends for the delay.
sf it has been the wvant of requisite
s means, we cannot but deplore the unhap
py effects, which this procedure, on the
e part of our business community, will have
a tendency to produce, as a large amount
of property must be sacrificed, to satisfy
the vutartes of the laws. But, if on the
Icontrary, there has been a want of dispo
al sition to meet just demand., when due, we
acannot but hope, that the law will have
'!he desired effect, of hringing people to
their setnses, and to wartn them in future,
r not to contract debts, wvhich they have no
idea of paying at maturity.
We would, that it tnight have been other
-wise, that the expenses which must accrue
-from a procedure by law, might have been
~averted, and we yet indulge the hope that
.thme time is not far distani, when we shalt
. once more assume our former station, as
~.Out of debt.
Executive Clemency.-- -We notice by a
. paragraph in the Charleston Courier, tbat
-. 1His Excellency Gov. Richardson has par
' dlotted a young man named George WA.
rJones, who w as sentenced to death, a short
I. time since, for having forged a check. for
'twenty dollars, on T. Tupper, Esq., Presi
-. dent of the L. C. & C. Rail Road Coin
pay The Courier remarks, "that the
case was one highly proper for E xecutive
interposition. as the criminal was convict
-ed, only of making, not of ttering or pas
Ssing the forged instrument. Jones is to
Sremain in jail for a cotsd rable time, in
rexpiatton of the crime of grand larceny, of
r- which he was also convicte 1, and for which
ahe has received several public whippings.
Consecration.-- -The consecration of the
Right Rev. Stephen Elliott, formerly the
r- highly respected Professor of Sacred Liter
ature, itt the College of this State, at Co
lumbia, took place, at Savannah, on Sun
day the 28th nIt.. He is now Bishop of
the Diocese of Georgia, Bishop Gadsden,
r. of this State, Bishop Meade, of Virginia,
- and Bishop Ives, of North Carolina, were
- present, besides a number of ministers from
*: thbis, and the adjoining States. The Sa
~e vannah papers, speak of the ceremonial as
- hightly interesming.
S The Georgian, at the close of an article
'ofsome length, quotes the following eulogy
upon Bishop Elliott.
-We know thte delicate character of his
- mind too well, to fume before him the uau
sseous incence of adulation, and we will
only say, that not his Diocese only, but all
id Christians, of whatever names. rejoice in
id thc eoning of sucht n fnithful and zcnions
