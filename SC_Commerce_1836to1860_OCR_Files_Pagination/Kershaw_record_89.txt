Wite Trout, soys the, Bull'alo Journal
of Thursday last, were yesterday caught '
in the lake, to the tuue of about nine hundred

A True Fish Story.?We are credibly'
' informed, says the last Cincinnati Whig,
by an eye witness, that a large Catfish, ]
weighing ninety-eight pounds, was caught
in the Ohio Kirer, a few weeks since,*.
about a hundred miles below Louisville,
which on being opened, was found to.
contain a negro child of considerable size!
Literary Curiosity.?The following
is a copy of an excuse recently handed in
to a schoolmaster for the non-attendance
of one of his scholars:
"cepatomtogoataturin."
If our reader can make out to solve
the above without having, it labelled, we
give up at once that they are more apt at
such things than our humble selves?and
for fear that there may be some who
would not understand it without an ex-!

Two Sharps.?An old man picked up a
lialf a dollar in the Park. 44 Old man,,
that's mine," said a real poking rascal,
" so hand it over." 44 Did your's have a
hole in it !" asked the finder. 44 Yes it
had," said the other smartly. " Then it
isn't thine," mildly replied the old roan,
44 thee must learn to be a little sharper
next time."

A very accomplished gentleman, when
carving a tough goose, had the mis for- j
tune to send it entirely out of the di6li,
and into the lap of the lady next to him ;
on which he very coolly looked her full
in the face, and with admirable gravity
and calmness,said, "Madam, 1 will thank
you for that goose." The gentleman
gained as much credit for his politeness
and composure, as he had lost by his awkward
carving.
An Egyptian goose was recently shot at
"Wargravc, England, which measured 4
feet 4 inches from tip to tip, and 2 feet 2
inches from head to tail. The plumages

part grey, the centre white, and the extremity
purple. The bird weighs near 10
pounds.
Breach of Promise.?Yesterday morning,
says the N. York Star, a well-known
gentleman of this city was held to bail in '
the sum of $5,000, that being the amount
claimed bv a fair lady, for a cruel breach
of promise to marry, made by the said
gentleman. Last night, we were informed
that the parties were about compromising
the delicate affair. Under these circumstances
we refrain from giving the
names at present.
A Hungry Rascal.?Yesterday afternoon,
a savage looking fellow, named
Charles Haines, was committed to prison
for biting off the ear of Mr. James Shaw,
of No. 416 Water-street. N Y
Slave Speculation.?Ten thousand
slaves were purchased on credit hy the
Mississippi planters in the years lKB5-(i.
The fall oi cotton in price render them
of little value. They are worse slock in
these times for Lheir masters than old horses
in a hard winter in Mew-England.
The following anecdote, from the Bos- '
ton Post, is told of little Keely who was y
a printer. s
Long after he had assumed the histrio- 1
rue profession, he happened into a print- I
ing oflice, and without thinking, took up '
a stick and commenced setting. All at
once he heard from every quarter of the
oilice, the mysterious exclamation?" (i.

replied one of the hands; "and you must |
treat the office !" Peter was not the man ,
to funk out of a treat, hut in relating the |
anecdote, he never omits to a<td?" I'll (
bo hanged if the Great Indulgence didn't ,
cost me more than a barrel of beer." (
Look before you leap.?Laura Groen, 1
a stout wench, who was arrested and '
brought up for stealing a furnace, taking 1
advantage of a momentary confusion in
the office, sprang out of the window of
the police office towards the Park, when
her garments corning in contact with one
of the bars, left her hanging outside the
wall like a hat on a peg, until the officers
relieved her from her uncomfortable position.
It is stated in a western paper, that a
well-dressed man was lately found in the
streets of Wetumpka, Ala. It was first
supposed that he had been murdered.
*' Who slew him?" asked an inquiring
philanthropist. * D >n't know," responded

Lucky Escape.?A person in Mississip-j
pi was lately chased thirteen miles l?y no
less than swcntccn thousand rattlesnakes,
and got clear of them all. The fellow
must have "leaned it like all natur," as
the Yankees say*
Love.?Love exalts and purifies our i
natures; it is imposed upon us by indul- i
gent heaven, in order to soften the rigid- <
ness of our humors, temper the violence s
of our passions, and sweeten the bitter <
draught ol life. I

Horses and Actors.?It is reported
of Mr. Duciow, the equestrian, that once,
while superintending the rehearsal of a
grand equestrian spectacle, he addressed
a biped performer, who was a little too
forward in the scene, in these words:
"Get out of the way, sir?stand buck?
would you have the assurance to stand
before a horse?"
An Improvement for tiie Ladies.?
Mr. John Hand, of Summcrfield, Penn.
givefc noticee that he has invented a very
simple apparatus to be attached to ladies
corsets, whereby the delicate little creatures
may be compressed into the compass
of a hoe-handle, by the gentle drawing of
two strings which can be tied in front.
Stealing Dogs* Tails.?The singular'
bounty offered in Sidney, New Holland, |
for killing dogs for their tails, has led to I
the practice among the loafers of that convict
colony, to curtail the appendage of
all the animals of this species running
abroad as a more brief way of reaching '
the reward in question. Ti e municipal j

Banking Privileges.?"Sambo, where
are you going in so great a hurry," says
a gentleman to a negro fellow, who appeared
tube almost out of breath. 4Why

4 Mow much sperie do your rotes call for
Sambo," says the gentleman. 41 hal> no

and de Bank say he won't gib specie arter

much is yours Sambo,* says the gentleman.
4 It quarter dollar, and 1 mus hah
cbcry cent nb it in specie, or I snrtinly will
veto dat Bank. I don't go for Nick Biddlc
no how you ran fix it.
Nice Ladies.?The nice obi lady, in
Virginia, who scrubbed through the floor
and fell into the kitchen, is but one among
many of the very nice females with which
our country abounds. We know a good
lady in New Jersey who white washed all
the wood she burnt ; and another, in Connecticut,
who used three times a day to
scour the nose of her 1:?p dog, to keep him
from soilingrthe dish out of which he ate
his meals." The same pood ladv took Iter
own food through a napkin-ring, to keep
it from coming in contact with her Iips.
Fortitudc ?fie who courageously submits
to his fate, and suffers without murmuring,
is certainly a most respectable
being; and it must he a mean and insensible
mind that can refuse to pity a man,
who, obliged to indure, hardens himself
in sorrow, and supports pain nobly. Such <
virtuous resignation should excite our admiration,
and render sympathy more ten- i
der and active. Besides, it is very nntu- <
ral to shrink from beholding misery in i
others, which we ourselves could support ?
vilhout complaining. This is a sublime <
.ensation, and common to all superior
ninds, of which we have daily a thousand \
proofs. For' example ; I can see nivself t
bled, and hold the bason. and yet 1 am affected
when 1 look at the lancet wounding
Lhe vein of another.
Garlic.?The Hungarian jorkies frequently
tie a clove to their racers' hits,
when the horses that run against them fall
back the moment they breathe the offensive
odour. It has been proved that no
horse will eat in a manger if the mouth
of any other steed in the stable has been ! |
rubbed with the juice of litis plant. I had i ;
occasion to ascert in this fact. A horse j |
of mine was in the same stall with one I (
belonging to a brother officer. Mine fell j
away and refused l;is food, while his com- ' ,
panion throve uncommonly well. I at ,
last discovered a German groom, who had ,
charge o<" lite prosperous uuiu.nl had re- .
course to this vile stratagem. It is also ,
supposed that men who eat garlic, knock |
up upon a march the soldiers who have ;
not made use of it. Hence, in the old
regulations of the French armies, there
existed an order to prohibit the use of
garlic when on march.

Original Anecdotes of School Teachers.?
A young collegiate, who had
just finished his course and received his
parchment, on his return home undertook
to teach the town school, as an amusement
during the winter, presuming it a
pleasant recreation to
'Teach the young idea how to shoot. '
Mo,id ay morning arrived?the hopeful
boys and girls flocked in?our young
friend commenced arranging and classing
them, hut soon found that the stubborn
works of nature do not yield to art with 1
out a struggle. Having a large bump of (
order on his cranium, he commanded
them to sit down and remain quiet. His !
commands were respected* in ihe same
miiiiuer as inose. of Canute, when he or- i
tiered the wa' cs of the ocean not to approach
him. Anarchy had seized their
juvenile minds, and they drank deep from
the fountain of liberty. Obedience was i
a hitter pill, and they denounced all the i
nostrums of their new physician. A few ,
doses of birch and hickory were ndminis
tered, which served only to enraee the fe- !

Our young collegiate found himself in

to relinquish his command, and turn them ,
over to abler hands, lie accordingly
[ ailed them together, bade them farewell, *

The evils of a false credit system, re- (
peated as they have been, and wide-spread s
and desolating as they have proved, have, ?
from an apparent unaptness in communities! |
to loam irotn history or experience, been
permitted to pass with little or no effect 1
upon the conduct ol sue 'ceding times. We, t

seem to have been partially remembered, '
because they were novelties in their day, |r
and had the fnrce of novelties; hut their |
influence, as a warning to the future, is,
and long has been, wholly lost, as is shown 1
by the recurrence of projects and excess
in speculation, compared with which, the 1

This terrible and almost literally accurate

misapprehension and delusion, and
thereby, retard, if it should not wholly
prevent, the return of ills such as now

Communications,
Mr. Editor:?In the national Gazette,
of 22(1 lift. I observed an editorial notice,
in 14 allusion to the Scheme of the'American
Society for the promotion of Education
in Africa," and was surprised to find
feelings of sympathy so misplaced as those
expressed by the editor in that piece.?
Ilis fancy warms with the idea of the
splendid triumph for the American people
to redeem a Continent from the depths
of ignorance, barbarism, and paganism,
for which Europe has done little hut extort
! Whose ancient empire Rome overturned
and arrested the hand of improvement.
It is true lie admits that the mere
attempt carries with it an air of utter
Quixotism. Indeed it is rornau.ee?then
why favor it, as if we had no substantial,
legitimate duties at home of like kind, to
attend to. In our otvn country education
is still acknowledged to be infinitely
imperfect ; yet we arc willing to go on in
a flattering kitid of delusion to consider
American intelligence so superior in comparison
with that of the European population,
as to justify our idly passing by
her excellent example of what is due at
home, in order to 44 educate and new mold
a benighted world.'* Prussia, possessed
of good common sense, has wisely
thought that charity begins at home; and
although one of the most arbitrary governments
of Europe, ofTeN an example in the
slate of her public institutions worthy of
imitation and which has justly excited the
admiration of Europe. In her institutions
the children of ell, even of the meanest peasant
in the kingdom, arc receiving more
varied and solid instruction than our
schools are competent to furnish. This
irises from her wise care in providing
schools for the instruction of Teachers
exclusively, of which she now numbers
forty. France as Well as the rest nf F.n.
mpe, has followed in her wake, and counts
hirty of that description ; whilst the U.
States, claiming to be not only the most
ree but the most generally if not best inbrmcd
country in the world, has but one
vhich is justly the boast of Massachusetts.
>Jew York and other states have made
heii effort, but impartial enquiry has do larcd
that the present system of fcduca
ion is radically defective. Not only so,
nit the further humiliating fact has been
lisclosed to the British parliament and
spread before the na?ion by one of her
commissioners for the investigation of our
iystem of police and education, that South
ind West of New York, there were at
east 1,300,000 white children and youth,
otally destitute of the means of elemenary
education. If this be so, and I fear

A late able writer has observed, 44 that
ooking to the models of Geimany and
Prance, no system of public instruction
las yet been organized, in any of'the
tales, and in none has the appropriate
,vork of legislation been more than comnenced.
I do not hesitate to avow the'
>elief that without regulations far more
xtensivc than have been yet introduced;
1 control far more enlightened and constant
than has yet been exercised; and a
riscal .aid far more ample than has yet
oeen afforded, it is vain to expect that the
character of our common schools can be j
rulv, and permanently improved."
This however would be an act of dntj j
ind too common place and attainable n (
purpose to merit attention. It is distance, jnccrtainty,
romance, that wins our appromtion.
We should incline to think that
Phrenologists have well placed the organ |
>f benevolence in the close neighborhood i
of marvellousness, having only that of
mimickry intervening. Let me urge upon,
I the, I hope willing disposition of our Ediitor,
the propriety, as well as necessity of
(concentrating our efforts upon home purI
poses, and not to think of advising a visit
I to Africa at present. Let Cuffec alone
both at home and abroad, Jjift let him improve
his talent by urging to the promotion
ot the happiness of millions of white
children within our own country?either
totally destitute or nartiallv possessing
I ?r t O
the means of education.
His paper from its intelligence, gentlemanly
qualities, and general circulation,
occupies a justly high stand, and through
it lie may do much good on this subject.
I have ever respected and promoted its
interest from its commencement to the
present moment, and it is in consideration
of this high respect that I wish to see its
efforts in favor of education directed into
the proper channel until all our domestic
imperfections arc corrected and wants
supplied; then enlarged philanthropy well
schooled at home, may go forth in search
of another continent and other objects on
which to exercise feelings of benevolence.

THE PLAGUE.
In the news by the last arrival From England,
it was mentioned that much alarm
had been occasioned in the neighborhood
of the London Docks, by the sudden death
of two men who had assisted in unloadin"
a vessel freighted with rags from
Trieste. It was feared they bad died of
the Plague. Although this apprehension
was probably incorrect* we are not so
sure that England is safe front such an invasion,
or the United States either. It is
well known that the elothes of persons
who have died of the Plague, or clothes
in which they have slept, unless very thoroughly
cleansed and. purified, are almost
certain to communicate the disease. And
as we are continually importing rags from
the Mediterranean, it will be fortunate if
we do not get a spice of the Plague with
them. We commend to the notice of the
public, and especially to the parties more
immediately interested, the following paragraph
from Blackwo >d's Magazine for
April.
While England swells with faction,
France with faction, Germany with faction,
