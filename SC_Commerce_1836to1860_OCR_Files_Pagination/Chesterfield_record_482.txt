REVIVAL IN 'SCOTLAND.
A rorrespondent of the Inverness four*,
ier says:?
'I'lie revivals in this quater, cf which
I n short time ago sent you an account,
hava since been spreading and progrossing
to an extent that must gladden the
heart of every wellwisher of the good
cause. In the parish of Alness, to which
| formerly confined mv remarks, the
the great work is going on and prosper,
ing. pud the rfleets of it are daily hecotny>g
more apparent in the amended and reloaned
liws of some, the increased and
increasing concern of innny as the things
which belong to their everlasting peace,
i?nd itt f!.c more regular and frequent at
- " ctendance
of almost ail upon theappointed
means aijl ordinances of religion.
But the work has not been confined to
jho parish of Alness; it has spread, an:l
continues tp spread, through every part
/?f ihe country, in some places manifes*irg
its presence more opet:Jy; in others, '
as extensively^ perhaps, though not so
visibly > and there are few parishes in
Ro.v8-s.hire where awakening-, similar to
v hat took place at Alness, have not occurred,
though not perhaps, to such an
cxlent; and there are none where a
grenter cu/iccrn about religion than has
heretofore pf? vailed, has not displayed
jjbmlf. The judgment of the great clay
can reveal how many have b^<:?
turned from the service of sin in this
season of the great power of the Lord.?
In the parish of Kiltearr, in which there
would be too good reason for writing
"IchvZodt the g'ory is (Wparted," even io
ibis destitute and suffering parish, where
tiie people have so fcng pined for the
want of ordinances, fhe good work has
had a commencement and better davs
seem to be dawning upon it, and brigivr
prospects opening.

Pastoral Visitation and .Ministerial
Kk.sponsih.litv.
There is a disposition in tlie world, a an
even with many Christains, io find fault
witi) ministers. The best niimstus a c
but imperfect men, ard possess the troasti e
committed to them i.i "earthen vessels."
Often a great deal more is expected of
Clergyman than the nature of the case ndo?
mits. To meet the views of some people
. ministers would have to '>_ gifted with the
physical strength, the sparkling intellect,
1 and sinless perfection of ang^'s. Whi'e
1 we fully believe that the opeoiatu ns of
' many people in rc; tence to 'he clergy arcunreasonable,
we at the same time are
forced to acknowledge that there are too
