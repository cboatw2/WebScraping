Writs plain; not merely so plain that the
editor can 'make it out,* but so write that
the compositor cannot fail to read every
syllable. Take care of your orthography.
Pun^tnate correctly, and do net leave half
that task, for the weary editor. Make
some ditinction between little u and little

Improvement in Corn.?We are happy
to notice in the Patent Office some beautiful
samples of Corn, deposited by-Thos.

Prince Georges county, in Maryland.?

eight ears on them respectively. Mr.

years* careful cultivation. Many small
parcels were last year distributed by the
Commissioner of patents, (Hon. H. L. <
Ellworlh) and in this way, Corn has been
happily introduced into the Southern and
Western States. One hundred bushels
can be raised on rich land, and it is said i
that one hundred and twenty-five bushels '
have been raised the past season on an
acre in the Wabash valley.?Globe. (
Income from Tavern Licenses.?-Ac- !
cording to the Auditors report, the reve- I
nue to the State of Pennsylvania for li- I
censes was, for the last year $50,779 23.
Of this amouut $15,010 07 is credited to t
the Treasurer of Philadelphia county.? I
we should have liked very much to have 1
seen a statement of the expenses which
the Slate is under for Alms Houses and t
Penitentiaries which are mostly filled by i
the individuals which by a state license I
* were made wicked and worthless. We t
do not state this fact as in contrast to the i
condition of affairs in our own state. We e
sincerely wish we could. f

this rather a poor business, especially for I
the collector evon if he got fifty per 1
cent for his trouble. We doubt very 1
much if our own state revenue exceeds x
that sum from a like source. ) (
Dead Letters.?In the Post Master f
General's report, the astonishing fact is ]
mentioned, that there are received annu- ^
ally at the dead letter office in Washington
about 000,000. The clerks in ihe{ t
'tlead letter office should boon their guard j
to prevent impositions in the matter of a
dead letters. It is an easy matter for a t
post master to send letters as uncalled t
for to Washington, and get a credit on r
their account, when said letters may be i
originated in the office from which they %
were said to be returned, and have some t
foreign post mark put on them. This
piece of roguery has been done hereto- e
fore, and may be done now. I
A valuable Ring.?The'most Valuable tl
ring that we ever heard of. was the nn? '
'that encircled the tomb of Osymandias, J:
at Thebes, which was carried off by Cam
byses, after his return from his expedi-lion
into Ethiopia. It was of solid gold, 1
and three hundred and thirty -five cubits 1
in circumference, or more than one hun- a
'dred and fifty feet in diameter,
This ring in the present day, would be 0
justly considered a magic ring. What 8
wonders might be achieved by it'! TVs- 1
sesscd of it, a man might build a palace, 1
a canal, or a rail-road, with as much cer- 11
tainly, if not in so short a time, as the ?
genii of the lamps and rigs used to per form
their wonderful feats -With it the 1
banks might resume specie payments? v
the government might finish the Florida "

vu> mo GApiunng expedition?
and keep up the necessary naval force *
upon our coast to afford prelection to our 11
commerce. With it, the Canadian radi- *
pals would be certain to achieve their independence,
and with it, the English J1
could with ease retain them in subjection.
If given to us, we think it would be;c
used with propriety, and for the benefit of 8
the world; but whether we made a good
Or bad use, it would be, (however massive
it might be,) soon "used up." j

"Mr. Clay of Ky. begged that the moion

ncrease caused by supposition on the

j The leading whig papers to England
are now making vigorous war upon the
church?or rather upon the intolerance
and pride of the overpaid dignitaries,
whose services to the cause of religion
add mprals, they present ih striking contrast
with their vast emoluments, and
hnlK ti'iih ?4 *- J v
-? n imi uic services ana emoluments
of.the inferior clergy* Judging from the
tone of these papers, we prognosticate
that the hierarchy in England is destined
to have a fall. r
The e}ecretrry of thfe National Association
in Ireland, has at last concluded to
pay bis tithes, having resisted for many
months. As about the same time a farmer
came to the same judicious resolution,
! after being in jail 7 momths for resisting
I payment. It is thought that there will be
i nb more wilful Opposition to the collection
of the tilhCs, Mr. O'ConnefH having
recommended its discontinuance. By the
way, we must not forget to mention thht
the National Association was dissolved on
the 31st, according to order from the
great agitator, who seems to have put it
out as easily as he got it up.
Royal Present.?The Queen and
Duchess of Kent, have been presented
with sundry pairs of stockings, knit from
Shetland wOol bv the hands of Shetland
women; so fine, that although each thread
consists of three strans. a pair of the
stockings can be drawn with case through
a lady's finger ring. This is considered a
very warm proof of attachment.
&mong the recent deaths announced in
England, we obserVe those of the dowager
visconntis of Ekmouth, widow of the
celebrated vice admiral, and Lady C&tharine
Bathurst, sister of the late Earl
Bathurst.

LOWER CANADA.
Defeat of the Canadians at St. Eustache. i
We have advfees from montreal to the
15th inst., which give us some particulars
of the success of ihe British troops, under
Sir John Colborne, at St. Eustache. The
troops encamped on the night of the 13th
at St. Martin, which they left at 7 o'clock
on the morning of the 14th for St. Eustache,
by the way of St. Rose, where they
crossed the ice from the Isle of Jesus, to
the main land. On entering the village,
the troops were saluted by a volly of mus- ,
ketry from the Church of St. Eustache- ,
The village was completely surrounded
by the British, when they commenced a
well directed fire upon the Church, which ,
having been set on fire, compelled the
Canadians to fly in every direction that offered
a probability of escape. From 40
to 50 were k.lled and.wounded, and about
100 taken prisoners. The English had 1
l.ili ? ? ^ ~
miiea and o or IU wounded. The Star
says, Dr. Woolfred Nelson, died in prison
on the morning of the 15th, from his late j
sufferings in attempting to escape from
Province. He was an Englishman by
birth, and a man of considerable Wealth.
Sir John ColLorne wa? to march on the
morning of the 15lh upon Grand Brule,
where the Canadians had been throwing
up entrenchments for several'weeks.
We copy the following statement and 1
remarks from the Philadelphia Gazette.
We have no reason to doubt their accu- J
racy, though we have heard nothing of '
he circumstance before. The conduct
iscribed to the "gallant Commodore" is 1
w I - - ~ ( |
so appropriate, and in such close keeping <
vith his character, that we can very reality
credit the account independently of
tny regard to the respectability of the
iource whence it carries. We hope Lieu.- i
enant Hunter, Mr. Barton and a few <
rthers will hold themselves in readiness t
.o pay their respects to him through the 1
medium of a Court Martial as soon after .
tie honors his country by his presence, as
wifl be convenient for him to attend to t
such compliments.
We are sorry, though ye confess* not
greatly surprised, to hear that Commodore
Elliott has again been plunging himself (
ipto hot water, and doing those things
which he ought not to have done. An .
officer, and one whose calling alone is
sufficient to excite the reepect and esteem
of every one, has hefen ordered from the
(Constitution to the schooner Shark, asa J
punishment, it is supposed, for not lend- J
ing himself t? the measures taken bv the i
_ ? ? J
Commodore against Lieut. Hunter. This
gentleman, a chaplain in the Navy, has .
prefeired his complaint to that depart- *
ment. Col. Ledyard, a passenger on ]
board the Constitution; and attached to t
the Legation, was informed by Commo- i
dure Elliott, through Capt Boerum (for
some trifle wherein ho had offended, per
haps unintentionally) that lie muSidd one {
of three things-?apologize, meet the Com- (
modoxe !?or leave his ship. I
We give th^se accounts as they have
reached us, and with the presumption
that nothing will hereafter disprove them.
They have been conveyed in letters to
this country. Of the discretion or dignity
of Commodore Elliott, in the aflairs
alluded to, the least that may be said, is
probably the beft.

going-down of the flat, while crossing the Camden
Ferry. The Express rider was on board, sitting on

charger, to the opposite bank. But twoof the
negroes on board, wore saved. *
The particulars relative to the manner in which
this catastrophe occurred, Imvo ndt as yet been fully
ascertained.
Lynches Ck'eee. ?The Legislature in 1836
appropriated $3,000 for the improvement of
synches Creek, which work was contracted for,
and reported finished, but which on the 'examines
tion of the Commissioners was not accepted?the
work notbeingdone according to contract. Whether
the omission in the nppropriation^Bill of the
$3,0<)0 granted at the late session, together with
the default above mentioned will retard the prosecution
of the work, must in a great measure depend
on the views the Superintendent may take of
the instructions given him by the Legislature at its
last session. If the work is practicable,"ihe omission
of llie $3,000 in the Hill should cert&inlyhave
no bearing, it being evidently an ui tin leu
tional neglect on the part of the Engrossing Conimittcc.
Tlie Abolition'question has at last bcon settled

in any District, State or Territory oft he U. S. which
was adopted by a vote of 122 to 71. Mr. Ai?amh
