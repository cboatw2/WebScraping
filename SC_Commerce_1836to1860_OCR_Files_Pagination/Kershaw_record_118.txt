PREPARED BY

IT is with great pleasure the subscriber informs St
the public that he has completed the inixtore ol
the VEGETABLE ELIXIR. This medicine is
composed of Roots which grow in this State. It is
useless to enter into a detail of the value of this Me- th
dicine, for any other Root medicine,) as It is well th
known that all Roots have valuable Medical pro- to
pertics. He w >uld also state that there is not the I"
least danger in lite use oi the Elixir. For the fol-1 D
lowing named diseases, there is no medicine made or p<
vended at the presenttime, better calculated to relieve ir
the afflicted, than the Vecbtablb Elixir. C
For Rheumatism and Consumption, the Elixir tli
should be used internally and externally. at
.For Dyspepsia or Dvsury, ho would also Tecum- C
mend the use ot the Elixir, as he feels confident U
it wilt prove highly beneficial to those who use it. n
.. To thoae who are afflcted with Pustules, Eruptive ?
Fv Distempers, and Venereal. diseases, he particularly si
reebwnWidstheuseorthe VEGETABLE ELIXIR, d
Without the fear of contradiction, he recommends this
Medicine as -the best now in use'?as it has proved
successful in every case in which it has been used.
"Orders addressed to the subscriber or Mr. J. fi. i

From the general embarrassment of the times ;
ie deranged slate of the domestic exchanges, and > m
te difficulties attending the disposal of Bunk Bills (
at of their immediate circles of issue, we have E
ten solicited by agents and Venders to postpone
ie drawing of the above scheme, for a short time,
itil the present crisis in the affairs of the coun- T
y shall have passed av>ay.
We have therefore yielded to these solicitations,
id postpone tho drawing ot the Alexandria Lotteclass
E, from the 27th of May, to the 23d day
' September next, when the drawing will posively
take place.
Adventurers having purchased tickets in said
ass, and who do not wish to hold tli.ni until the
rawing, can have their money returned by the
rentoi broker from whom they purchased?or can
tchange thnn for tickets in classes to be drawn
an earlier day, as it may suit their pleasure.
The Managers have consented to this postpone
pnt with extreme reluctance, as it has always
en ineir poimv i 1 iw every scheme at the lime ,w
inounced. The unparalleled state of the coun- ,n
y, is the only cau e of this one departure from

PATENT COTTON GIN.
TII1S Gin can he made double, or single. It
made double, they reduce labor, and gin just
double, the quantity of cotton over the single cylinder
Gin, no other knd having been in use prevoue
to tins patent; and whether single or double, they
are found to improve the quality of the cotton, by
more perfectly cleaning it. They can be made to
contain from 20 to lfiOsuwsin a stand, and whether
small or large, one hand will be sufficient to attend
ttiein. The Gins have mechnnical feeders and
hoppers attached to them, which free the cotton
from leaves, trash, dirt, &c. before it can reach the
saws, and by the thorough hackling operation it
receives from the feeders, which make two revolutions
to one of the saws, it is almost in a half
gined state, before it descends to the saw By a
very simple arrangement of a screw to each set of
gaates, on which the hoppers rest, and through
which the teeth of the feeders pass, they can he
made to teed slow or fast to suit the condition of
the cotton at the time. When made double, the
saws are placed on two sets of cylinders and turn
upon each other in opposite directions, and are
cleansed by two sets of brushes that have four revolutions
to one of twe saw. The two cylinders can
i>e detached so as to ennble the planter to run one
)r both at pleasure, although embraced with feeders.
&c. in one stand. The whole is put in operation
villi a drum and band, as in the ordinary Gin, and
nay be propelled by horse, steam, or water power.
It may also be propelled by iron running gear.
The force required to work it, is about the same as
hat necessary to move an equal number of saws in
he common Gin. This Gin has been put in
iperation in New Orleans for two or three weeks,
ind its success tested in the presence of u large
lumber of planters, mcrchnnts and others, and
eceived tlieir general approbation
Several gentlemen have been so kind as to give
he Patentee their written opinion lespecling the
neritsof the Gin. A number of others could be
idded, but the following are deemed sufficient:
from his Excellency G >v. White of Louisiana.
New Orleans, Feb. 27, 1837.
Dr. A. Jones?Sir, In reply to your enquiry,
vliat I think of your improved Cotton Gin, I have
o say, that I saw it work on Saturday the2olh inst.
mii was very much plensed with its performance.
The mere fact of its self-feeding, seems to rue to
>e a very valuable improvement; nnd besides, the
luality of the cotton, as it conies out of the process,
appeared to me to be better and cleaner than
Vom the common Gins in use. and that it ?????
:onsiderably in labor. Respectfully, Ac.
E. D. WHITE,
from Mr J. Compton, a wealthy planter, resident
in the Parish of Rnpide, Louixumn.
Dr. Jones?Dear Sir, 1 have examined your PaLent
Cotton Gin, with feeders, &c. And have
seen it in operation, and approve of it so highly,
that I have taken the liberty of ordering one for
my plantation in time for the next crop.

j accompanied by a specimen of the cotton, ginnra
by your Patent Gin, 1 beg leave to observe, that it

your Patent Gin, have been confirmed by subsequently
witnessing it in operation. The utility of

Dr. A. Joi.es?Dear Sir, in answer tc your inqui8
ry of my opinion of your Patent Cotton Gin, I
' bee Jeuve to state, that 1 was fifteen years crgc(red
in the cotton factories of Manchester, Engand,
and during four years of that tin e, 1 wos
foreman in the house of Messrs. Lewis, Williams
8 & Co., and near five years spinner in the home of
| Messrs. Sandford A Gr?ene. 1 have seen your
Cotton Gin in operation, and have examined tl.e
1 cotton ginned by it, and pronounce it better e.lenn'
sed, and the staple less injured, than any cottcn
' that ever came under my observation. It is com|
pletely ready f or the breaker without the aid ol the
f blower, and would, therefore, save the first process
1 in manufacturing the article. 1 consider cotton
cleansed by your Gin, would command from one
| to two cents on the pound more than the average
crops brought into the Manchester market, and
L cleansed by common Gins Yours, very resp'ly.
N. Orleans, March 9, GEORGE SENIOR.

>] respecting my opinion of your Patent Cotton Gin,
I have to state, that I have been engaged in put
ting up the Carver Gins for planters on Red River,
and that I hove seen your Gin in operation, and
have examined the quality of the cotton produced
by it; I consider it equal it not superior to the Carver
Gins': in addition to which, 1 think your feeders
a decided improvement, and by the aid of
which, the quality of the cotton cleansed appears
much improved, over that produced by the common
Gins. Yours &c. S. BENNETT.

It is desirable, when plantersgive orders for Gins,
they should accompany th< m'with their views in
regard to the arrangement of saws, breasts, brush*
es, &c. Jt is found they differ in opinion Some
desire sows of larger diameter than others. The
most common size is 9 or 10 inches ; but some wish

particular. Where it is left to our discretion, we
shall make them on the most modern and approved

is received, in the apace of eight or nine weeks,
and the Gin in that time placed iji the hands of the

ought to be in the hands of the manufacturers by
the first or middle of May ; except for plantations
where they are late in commencing to pick or gin
' cotton.
