The Augusta Chronicle & Sentinel of
the 17th inst. says:-I'here has been an
unexampled scarcity or money here for
some weeks past, owine to di,agreemoents
among the banks as to the mode- of mnkina
settlements with each other. They have
almost entirely ceased discounting,' except
to renew running paper. It is to be regret
ted that in the midst 4#f the h-ziness hea
son, at a time whet no class of citi.ens ex -
hibits a disposition to run upon the banks
or :o press them. and when fheoii vianits
are plentifully stored wih coin. that any
causes in which the cepnmounity are not: in
terested, should create such a pres-ure up
on the business of the city. It is indeed.
as snuch a matter of siarprise as regret!
Banks, although owned by individuals,
were created by poblic authority, with as.
implied understanding that they were to
benefit the public as well as their owners.
Unon the faith of that understadug the
public rely upon the banks to furnish a
currency adequate to the business of the
country, and if for any petty rivalshipsanud
disputes atmong themselves they disap
point that reliance, they incur a henvy re
aponsibility, which will perhaps not be for
gotten in the day of reckoning.
