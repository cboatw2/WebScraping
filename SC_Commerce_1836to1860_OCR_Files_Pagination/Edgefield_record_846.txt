This i4,an iWportant juestion ; one that
.ve unhesitatingly iddwer in the negative.
We will now proceed to prove tha, .this
view of the case is supported by truth,
inrl cannot be denied.
In the grst plac, what is.ibq indiistry
of the country? ..Of what does it consisi 1
It 9toiisis of labor in the various depart

Conerce., Fisheries, &c. 1,250.000
Mines, Forests, &c. -1,0.,000
Aggregnte, . ... 17,000.000
From this it is evident that about tl!rce
fourths of tho whole population are enga
ged in agricultural pursuits; including those
eigaged in.the. mechanic arts. The rol

From this it is evident that. sn only the
great body ofthe people are agriculturalbut.
Ihat t he wealth or cdpital of the cotUntry is

.We idwisce cleqrly of what the industry

that it, requires but a small nutnherof pea

From these few..remarks that. we pre

at~mulaties if,.creates a b6:itt,.:ui'4 tridlen
:market for our ,surplus labor-thtat wrhich
we cann~ot ,consume-then we unihesita

it paralyzes industry, cuss of the market
