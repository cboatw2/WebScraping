commercial marine, is a humiliating corn
mentary on the political sagacity and com
mercial enterprise of our country. When
we consider the commerce of the Gulf of
-Mexico alone, foreign and coastwise,
which is thus left defenceless to foreign
cannon-a commerce which concentrates
near the mouth of the Mississippi piore
.property than human industry and enter
prise have ever elsewhere gi"en, by a sin
gle outlet to the sea, and when we reflect
on the disorder and distress by the obstruc
tion of that commerce, that would pevrado
all the walks of life amongst twenty mil
lions of people who inhabit this laud, the
neglect of the governtent becomes still
more surprising and inexplicable.
Congress, however. at its last session,
passed an act for the transportation of
Foreign Mails, and gave the Postmaster
General power to contract with steamers
for that purpose. We are informed that
an offer has been made to the Government
for the establishment of a line of steamers
from New York to Galveston, under ti is
law, and at a rate so reasonable as to be
paid by.tho postego ol the .route alone.
The line to consist of e ght vessels, all to
be surrendered td the government when
war begins. These vessels besides touch
ing at all our own important ports upon
the route, would likewise stop at some of
the principal ports of the West Indies
this giving facility and extension to our
intercourse with those fertile and wealthy
islands.
We trust that the new administration
which has taken such bold grounds in
- relation to the rigntsof the country contro
verted by foreign power, will lose no time
in perfecting the details of this policy so
essential to our commerce, either in peace
or war.

LATER FROM TEXAS.
The steamship New York, Captain

She brings us papers from Galveston to the

Donelson, the U. S. Churge, and Gov.
Yell, of Arkansas.
There is no limit to the cntbusiasm of
the people of Texas in regard to annexa
tion. The only trouble with them appears
to be, whether to meet in Convention and
form a Constitution for "the State of
Texas" pi ior or subseqent to the meeting
of Congress. This is a fertile theme for
the several editors. To show the disposi
tion of the President of Texas, we make
a short extract from the Morning Star of
the 341 inst., published at Houston :
{ We rejoice to say tl.at ne have the
most positive evidence that the President
and a majority of the members of his
Cabinet are anxious to act with the utmost
harmony with the people, and will cordi
ally co-operate with them, in their ef'orts
to consummate this great 'measure at the
earliest practicable period.
'The Ilon. E. Allen, the acting Secreta
ry of State. arrived at louton on the 23d

an ardent friend of annexation, and is
desirous that "' the great mneasure should
be consummated at the earliest practicable
period."

The Secretary of the Treasury-The
Tarif.--A recent -number of the Wash
ington Union, giving a glance at thte doitngs
of the different Departtments, has the fol
lowing remarks on the most important of
all.
Trhe Secretary of the Treasury is pro
verbial for his industry, attd marked for
his sagacity. He, too, is constant itn the
execution of his duties; and it gives us
much pleasure to state, than we ca 'wvell
express, that he is actively engaged in col
lecting from all parts of the country every
information that may be necessary to as
sist hitm in the management of ottr finan
ces. WVe have no doubt that he will be
prepared to--lay before Congress a large
body of the most useftul statistics, so as to
enable them, 'vithoum loss of. time and
wvith the aid of te best materials, to pro
ceed in fortming the best, and wisest, and
msost nearly equal system of revenue that
catn be adopted. We have little doubt
that the Secretary will at least do his part
in bringing the treasury back to a fair,
equalizing the public burdens. The pres
ent tariff can scarcely stand as the perma
nent system of this great country. t is
tor, unequal.in itself-too oppressive upon
some interests, too partial to others-too
favorable to the rich, too burdensome to
the poorer classes of the community. The
sooner it is reduced, the better for all. It
is better even for the manufacturers them
selves to understand on what they are to
calculate. It is better for the rich capital.
ists to have moderate and stable duties,
than those which are too high, and, on that
account, never fixed. but always unpopu
lar and always fluctuating. It is better
for the tranquility of the administration
better for the prosperity of the whole peo
ple.
We look with anxious interest to every
indication of the course of the Adminis
tration on the Tariff. After so many ship
wrecks, we are not easy of faith ; but none
will more heartily rejoice in the consum
tmation of an honest policy,-none will
sustain with warmer truer aid, any effort
to carry out the principle of a revenue ta
riff,-none will acknowledge a deeper
debt of gratitude to those who shall lead
in tho reform, than the people of South
Carolina. They will hold its authors to
be the deliverers of the country.
Charleston Mercury.
From the Charleston Mercury.
The following announcement ,appears
in the last N. Y. Herald. For ourselves,
we have no faith in it, and under all the
circumstances, think it of mighty little
importance whether it is true or not.
What interests us far more, is the state
ment in the last South Carolinian that M r.
Calhoun's health is quite restored.
HIaHLY IMPORTANT FROM WAStINGTON.
John C.. Calhoun probably going to
England. Oregon and a Com
mercial Treaty.
We received from Washington last eve
ning, by sa private and well infbrned cor
respondent; who has the best means of in
formation, some intelligence on the.move
ments of the administration of Mr. Polk,
of great and increasing importance in the
present critical position of our relations
with England on the Oregon and other
quest ions.
We are informed that Mr. Polk has
under advisement a project to appoint on
a special mission to England, John C.
Calhoun, of S. Carolina, with extraordi
nary powers and large discretion, to treat
with that Government, botb on the Oregon
territory and a Commercial treaty, on the
basis of reciprocity and equal duties. We
are assured also that Mr. Calhoun will
certaimly accept such a mission, although
he refused the ordinary mission, a few
months ago.
1: will be recollected that this mission
the ordinary grade-has been successively
ofmered to,. and refused by, both Messrs.
Elmore and Pickens, of South Carolina.
The refusal of both these gentlemen have
been caused by the belief among the
southern statesiren, that in the present
crisis of the country, and particularly
since the recent position of the British
Government, as assumed by Sir Robert
Peel, has been announced, no man posses
tes the peculiar and happy characteristics
for such a mission, in so eminent a degree
as Mr, Calhoun. A rumor was iv circu
lation some time ago in this ciy that Mr.
Van Buren was to be ullei=ed such a mis
sion. This rumor was, however. started
bysome of his partisans here, who -had
an inkling that the President preferredl
Mr. Calhoun. It is well kimen that on
the inauguration of Mr. Polk, the same
mission was offered ito Mr. Clhouni-buit
the relations of the Ujiited States with
England were not ihent in the menacing
condition that they are now, nor did they
require such position and force of charac
ter in the Envoy that-might be appointed
to negotiate. T1*he apple is tnow ripe.
Mr. Calhoun is peculiarly fi4t:ed' for th-is
great mission. H ii sentiments on the Ore -
gon qutestion are known, a.d comnmaui
confidence at thie North and armong~ the
cornimercial-cla;sses. ElIo opinious ou rhe
tarifi and the principles of reciproeity,
carry the whole South. Trhe selection or
this great statesmatn for such a missions
would also seem to indicate that a new
light had broken over the councils of Mr..
Polk-. We hope it mnay be so.

* TITLEs TO OREGON.
The English ministry attempt to.make
out their title to Oregon by right of dis
covery, when Spain, lromt whom te de
rive title, not only discovered but possessed
the country as far as Nootka Sound, (north
latitude 49,) and our treaty with Russia
fixes the northern boundary at 54 4U north
latitude. Our souttern boundary with
Spain, and next with Mexico is 4z nortlh
lat. The mouth of the Columbia is about
46d. north lat. By discovery, by actual.
pobsessiot in 1811, in advance of any En
glish settlement, and by purchase from
Spain and France we became the propri
etors of the territory. At the close of the
Revolutionary war England did not pre
tend to have any claim to Oregon, and as
late as 1926, ste oflered to extend the
eastern Rocky Mountain boundary fixed
at the close of the war (49d north lat.) to
the Pacific, asking at the same time a
transler of our rights north of that line to
lat. 54, as defined in our treaty with Rus
sia. This would have given England five
degrees, and the U. States seven degrees
of territory. But our government very
properly rejected the proposition, which
has been again renewed, we have reason
to believe, by the Mlinister now at Wash
ingion. The London Times says that
-the tone of Mr. Pslk's address does not.
lead us to suppose that her would even ad
here to the ultimatum [extending the boun
dary along 49d north lat.] of 1826, and the
Times is right. Although that line would
give us the l~ee niavigation of the Mtultuo
mah and Lewis's Rivers, (the great south
erm tributaries of the Columbiat,) and the
Uolumnbia for two to three hundred miles'
from its mouth, it would exclude us frotm
the northern half of thte Columtbia river.
and frotm Clark's river, its great tributatry,
as weil as fromt Nootka -Sound and seve
rel valuable harbors along the coast. Jus
tiee to piosterity resqueres great sacrifices to
retain tha't territory, and however much
we may widi an atmicable settement by
negotiation, we cannot see how our guy
crnment would lhe justified int givintg up
any part of it.

OBITUARY,
Died.at his residence in Abbeville District,
on the 13th instant, TaoxAs A . Mon-To., Esq.,
in the 57th year of his age.
The deceased was t native of the State of
Virginia, but for several years a restident in
this District. until his removal into Abbeville, in
Decentber last. Few men have passed throntgh
the various scenes ol - life with less difficulties,
and secured the permanent friendship ofa lar
ger immber of friends, than lie. In the year
1831, (a year dear in the memutoy of' many,)
he was enabled to repose his coifidence in the
Savior of sinners, and attached himself to the
Baptist .Chnrch of Christ at Bethany, of which
he continued a consistent member until his
death.
But a short time after he had made a public
professiot of his fioth in the Saviour, that faith
was called into exercise in the severe irials
through which lie had to pass. Within a few
weeks ie had to surrender to God who gave
themt all his children, save an only son still sur
vives. Amongst these, (four or five ini tnin.
ber) was an amiable and promising suit, whfo
had just compleied his edueation in our State
College, atnd was expecting to enter izto the
ministry of the Gospel-. tie, ho~wevcr. who
thus heavily aifflicted hias,~ gave stre.ngtht ac
cordintg to his day, and grace suflicient for his
trials, '-It is the Lord, let himt do wtuat seemnethi

the language of the Scripnires' was most illus
triously exeumhfied, "The righteouts hath htope
