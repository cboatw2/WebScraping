Omission Supplied.?Tlie Agricultural Lcttei
from Gen. Washington o his overseers which appeared
in our columns !ast week, was published
originally in the Southern Planter, of Richmond,
Va., from which periodical we copied it, and inadvertently
neglected to give the credit.
Mr. Webster's Speech.?We had no room,
last week, for comment on Mr. 33 ebster s speech,
and we are not now much disposed to indulge in
any. It is an extremely rare thing, in the present
day, to see a political speech which is not designed
to secure popularity with one or the other of the
great parties into which the country is at all times
divided. The speech of Mr. Webster furnishes
a striking exception to this general rule. The
only popularity which he seems to seek is that
which ought to be secured by an able, candid and
honest discussion and statement of the truth. He
does not fish for popularity with the Democrats;
for he avows his dissent from them, and his adhesion
to their opponents. The Whigs he rebukes
with * boldness and nlainncss which he could not
but know must give them offence. He also, without
hesitation, avows his dissent from the President
and bis adherents, on the impbrtant points on
which he differs from them. Mr. Webster never
was, and never can bo a demagogue. He relies
upon the transcendent power of his talents, the
purity of his patriotism, and the power of truth to
sustain him; and he seems to seek no popularity
but what these will bring him. Having said this
much, wc say farther, to prevent misapprehension
or misrepresentation, that we do not concur with
Mr. Webster in all the opinions expressed in the
speech; and particularly, wc dissent from his views
regarding a protective tariff, an 1 the principles
and design of the compromise of '33. Put wc do
not on that account the lcs3 admire the talents,
the wisdom, the integrity, and the noble self-sacri$cinj
patriotism of the man.
Gen. Hamilton's letter to Mr. Calhoun will
be found in the preceding columns. The reader
who is conversant with the history of political parties
in this Slate for the last dozen years will see
that there is more than one point on which the
General seems to have changed his opinion ; and
like a sensible man and honest patriot he is not
ashanjed or afraid to let it be known.
Asti-Tariff Meetp;u.?An anti-tariff meeting
has lately been held at Abbeville C- H. at
jyhich the Hon. D. L. Warolvw presided.?
Among the Pesolutions adopted were the follow.
inX.:
" Resolved, Thaf tlje act of the )ust session ol
Congress purporting to be a law to provide revenue
from imports, is a gross, fraudulent and unconstitutional
perversion of the power to raise revenue
by such duties."
M Resolved, Tii it the power to raise revenue
from imports can be constitutionally exercised only
to provide such revenue as the legitimate wants ol
the government?economically administered, may
require."
** Resolved. That a systern of revenue derived
exclusively from foreign imports, is essentially unjust
even in its most mitigated form, imposing bur.
dens on the consuming interest, and conferring
bounties on the manufacturing interest."
" Resolved, That the imposition of duties on imports
w'th the purpose of prohibiting foreign commerce
to protect domestic manufactures, confers
special bounties on the latter, and exacts degrading
tribute froin the planting and exporting interests to
the extent of the prohibition thus unconstitutionally
effected."
" Resolved, That the distribution of thf proceeds
of the salts of the public lands amongst the State*
is no less an unconstitutional appropriation of the
treasure of the Government, than a flimsy pretext
for conferring bounties on manufacturers, unJw
the disguise of a tariff to raise revenue, and should
be regarded and deprecated as the introduction ol
^ the odious and unconstitutional policy of assuming
? the debts of the States."
" Resolved. That should these just and reasonable
expectations be disappointed, it will be the so.
Icinn duty of the State of South Carolina to devis.
such mode and measure of relief as w 11 unite,
under a common banner, every freeman within her
borders; and we here proclaim to the other Southern
States, our confident apd proud conviction,
that in South Carolina all parties will cordially
unite in some measure of redress which will effoc.
tualty- vindicate her sovereign rights and rc'icvc
her citizens from this system of worse than c-olonial
vassalage."
Gen. McDiffie addressed the meeting on
the subject of a protecting tariff, before the rc.
solutions were adopted and A. Burt Esq. aftei
they were adopted. In the third of the resolutions
quoted above, which is flic fifth of the series
adopted, ground is taken adverse to a " system
of revenue derived exclusively from foreign imports."
Of course, then, direct taxation is the
" system" which the meeting would favor. A favorite
system this with a few leading politicians in
this state and their followers; but it certainty
would not be long tolerated by the great body ol
the people in any state in time of peace ; and that
for the very good reason that they have learni
from long experience that a much leBs burthen,
some system will answer better. The true policy
in regard to taxation in all countries, and especially
in a republic, is not only to make it as light as
possible, but also to lay the taxes in such way as
shall make them to be most easily, and, therefore,
most cheerfully paid. This is by indirect taxation,
and in a commercial country like ours, by
duties ou foreign imports. This is the mode ol
raising federal revenue to which our people have
been accustomed, one with which they arc every
where well satisfied, and for abandoning which to
substitute the more burthensome and unequal mode
of direct taxation, there is no good reason.
Whatever amount of federal revenue is raised
whether it is done by direct or indirect taxation,
it is plain that the sum total taken from the pockfcts
of the people and from the aggregate wealth of
the country is the same in cither case. But in
the case of direct taxation you must pay the cash
to the Marshall whenever he cal's upon you for
it, or rather when he requires you to call upon him
with it And if you fail to do so, he seizes your
property, and sells under the hammer, for cash, so
much as will pay the tax and expenses of sale.?
Whereas you pay the tax by imposts at your eonvcnicncc
in the somewhat higher prices which you
give for your broadcloth, your beaver hat, your
boots, your silk dresses, your tea and your roflce,
whenever yo* feel able and willing to buy such

Vj
number of persons in the State. If, however, in
i this we are in error, and Nullification is the mca'
sure meant by the very respectable meeting at
Abbeville, we are very sure they v/ill find that
they have greatly mistaken public opinion through
J the State when they suppose that 44 fiuch mode and
! measure of relief will unite under a common ban|
nrr every freeman within her borders." The line
i I articles. The indirect tax, too, if laid with proper
I discrimination, in addition to being more easily
J and more cheerfully paid, falls chiefly upon the rich
? . and extravagant, who buy articles of luxury and
ostentation ; whereas the poor, honest, industrious
1 and economical man, who is in debt and strugi
?
i ghng to get out, or who wishes to lay up somej
thing to educate or support a growing family, if
I he choose to live chiefly upon bread, meat, milk,
butter and cheese, the productions of his own farm
and his own labor, and to wear fabricks manufactured
in his own family, pays little or none of the
I tax. It falls upon the rich and upon luxurious
j spendthrifts, thus operating, to eome extent, a9 a
I check upon demoralizing and anti-republican ex.
! travagance. But the contrast does not end here,
| No incidental advantage accrues, either to individ!
uals or to the country at large, from direct taxa!
tion. Whereas the increase of the price of inanu!
facturcd articles caused bv indirect taxation ena
bles our own mechanics and manufacturers to cnj
tcr into successful and profitable competition with
, those of foreign countries where the price of labor is
lower. We th us raise up among ourse! ves mechanics
j and manufacturing establishments, and, so far,
I render our country independent of foreign countries
for its supplies in both peace and war.?
We also enrich the country by bringing capital and
j mechanics from abroad, as well as by giving pro.
j fitable employment to capital at home seeking
i investment. And whilst all this is done, the ope|
ration costs the country no money, and puts it
to no inconvenience ; but is, on the contrary, an
economical and convenient mode of defraying the
expenses of the Government. The incidental benefits
of taxation by imposts accrue to our own
country, but those of direct taxation to foreign
j countries by keeping a market open for their manj
ufacturcs, and keeping us continually dependant
j upon them for many of our supplies.
It is sometimes asked, why raise, by a tariff.
] the price of articles which the greater number of
] people must buy whilst only a few, comparatively,
derive direct advantage from the increased price ?
j The answer is, that the object of a revenue tariff*
j the only kiud of tariff which wc advocate, is not to
j raise the price of manufactures. This is an inci|
dental result. This incidental result is iu itself an
I rvil ; hnt ornnd snrinTS out of it. It is tllC tax
I 1 ? ?3 " | o~
which the country pays for the rapport of its govcrnmcnt.
Direct taxation for the same object, is
a greater evil; because it is much more difficult
to meet; and it is neither accompanied nor follow
ed by any good whatever. As to the argument
sometimes relied upon against taxation by imposts,
that the people have-not intelligence enough to
perceive the amount of taxes thus paid by them,
and are liable to be imposed upon by exhorbitant
exactions for the support of their government, it is
not paying a very high compliment to 44 the most
enlightened people on the face of the globe." If
they cannot perceive it themselves, they always
have ardent and devoton friends enough in their
service to paint it out to them.
It is also sometimes asked. Why will the Southem
States submit to a tariff that raises the price
of articles which they must buy when only the
Northern States are benefitted by the Tariff. This
objection would apply only to a tariff the object of
which is to afford protection to manufactures, but
docs not apply to a revenue tariff. The direct benefits
of adopting a revenue tariff in preference to
direct taxation is felt equally by all parts of the
country. Money must be paid by all alike, for
the support of the national government; and it is
easier for all, North and South, to pay it by imposts,
that is by a tariff, than by direct taxation.
Th South pays no more by imposts, than it would
pay by direct taxation. But, it may be said, the
nci lental benefits of a revenue tariff are enjoyed
only by the Northern States. Well, suppose, for
the argvment, this to be true, shall we at the
1 I South insist upon paying our federal taxes in the
1 more burthensomc way, because the less burthensome
is followed by incidental benefits to others
and not to us?and these others, too, our countrymen
? Shall we, from envious spleen, punish our'
selves to prevent benefit to our friends ? Shall
^ we, like the dog in the manger, because we cun
not eat the hay, harrass ourselves by keeping oft
those who could, and who would fatten on it ?
But it Jb not true that the incidental benefits of a
revenue tariff, or in other words, the prosperity o;
: the manufacturing interest, dots not profit the
' South. Manufactures are springing up in almost
all parts of the South, and particularly in the Carolinas;
besides which, is it of no benefit to the
' country to increase its wealth, and render it more
) independent of foreign countries ?
How far the rt venue to accrue from the tariff
Qr the lust session of Congress may exceed the
wants of the Government, or whether it will exceed
them at all, remains to be jfroved by cxprri.
1 cnce. The limit fixed by the compromise of lb33
was 23 per cent, ad valorem. This was deemed
high enough at the time by all parties. But before
; the duties were reduced to that point, they were
fnnnrl incijffifirnt to meet the Wurit8 of tliC GoVCm
j mcnt in the present state of commerce. The inj
come of the Government was less than its cxpendi'
i tures, and it was running in debt, under both the
Van Burcn and Tyler administrations, and us well
when there was a Whig majority as when there
r was a Democratic majority in both branches o'
f" I Congress. It is plain, then, that the rate of duties
t : fixed by the compromise of 1833 is too low for the
present state of the country. Whether or not the
rate fixed by the late act of Congress is too high
r ! to meet the wants of the Government economically
r administered, is not yet known, and we repeat, can
> be learnt oijly from experience. If it should prove
1 too high and Congress should refuse to reduce it,
i then will be time enough for a peace-loving and law
abiding people to devise measures of relief. The
people find times hard enough already without
f plunging themselves into unnecessary difficulties
j in defence of mere metaphysical abstractions and
' i " forty bale theories."
1 [ The South Carolinian heads a notice of the Ab
bcville meeting as follows: " The Palmetto
Banner unfurled." The Palmetto banner, when
used, was the banner of Nullification. The meaning
of the Carolinian we therefore suppose to be,
that the proceedings of the meeting at Abbeville
j were a Nullification movement. The meeting it;
self did not make such avowal; and we cannot
| believe, without conclusive evidence, that a renewal
of the Nullification struggle is at the present
; time cqntcmu'atcd or designed by any respectable
! back as U)c best animals of his race. lie was sold
j at auction and bought by Col. Williams, the Pre- j
: sident of the Society, at the very low price of
j .$lo">. An evidence this of the inadequate value
j set upon good cattle in this region, where there is
J now only one other thorough bred Durham bull. |
J If there were more they would be more highly ap-1
1 predated.
There was another bull exhibited, a half Dur. [
| ham owned jointly by Mr. S. Sparks, Gen. M'. j
Queen, and Major Ellerbe of Marlborough.?
Though a beautiful and valuable animal, the pre-1
mium was very deservedly awarded to his compe- i
titor.
Col. Marshall and Gen. Gillespie were compcti- j
tors for the premium offered for the best bull year-'
j ling. Col. Marshall's yearling was a thorough j
bred Durham of high pedigree, red and white, a i
superior animal. To an unskilful eye that is cap-1
\ tivatcd only by a heavy coat of flabby fat, he ap- J
; pcared to disadvantage, having been fed low the j
i past season, his first in this climate, to guard
| against disease, which took off the beautiful cow 1
and heifer broqght out from New Jersey by his ,
i owner at the same time with himself. Gen. Gil-'
i lespic's yearling was a beautiful hall" Durham, well |
' formed, in fine order, and much admired by all
j who saw him. The premium was justly awarded .
'! to tne thorough bred.
i Mr. Springs and Col. Marshall each exhibited j
! three milch cows. Mr. Springs' were excellent!
and would have take n the premiums at any Jormtx
! meetings of the Society, but Co!. Marshall a on |
, this occasion were more than a matcli for them.
; | The Colonel's were deep red, two of them without'
: white. Their limbs were as straight and clean as
j those of the blooded race horse, and their coat of j
! hair as fine and glossy as his. Their form ^vasc.T. j
! ccllcnt and they had all proved themselves very j
superior milkers. Tfic premium was awarded to j
Pinky five years old. Her pedigree is not known,
but her color and form indicate her to be a cross
j ot the Devon with sonic heavier breed.
; Of hogs the number exhibited was very small. '
Mr. James Wright and Col. Harllee each cxhibi. j
j ted a Berkshire boar. Col. H.'s was the larger of j
: the two, but the premium was awarded to Mr. j
Wright's on account of his better form. Of sows j
| only one was exhibited, and that by ourself,?a
; ' thorough Berkshire. And a beautiful animal she
I is, though we " say it who ought not." As racers
j say, 44 she walked over the course", and took the
premium. She was a few days over sixteen i
months old, and for. length and depth of body, j
i straightness and breadth of back, fullness and |
weight of ham, capaciousness of thorax, smallncss j
j of head, lightness of bone, glossy fineness of hair, j
mellow elasticity of feel, sprightlincss of disposi-j
tion, beautiful symmetry of form, and thriftineas, <
i it would be difficult to find an individual of the 1
j swinish race (we do not say superior, but) equal to j
I her. (Reader, she is not for sale ; neither is any .
, of her kin in our hands.] I
0= We hoped to receive the official report of,
the Society's proceedings in time for this week's
; paper, but it has net yet come to hand.
i The Chronicle and Carolinian, of Columbia, j
have something of controversy growing out of J
i remarks of the former on the proceedings of the j
j Abbeville meeting. "U'c copy as a mere matter of;
J historical record, and not with any view of en- j
i gaging in the controversy between the two editors,
the following reply of the Chronicle to a taunting ,
j intimation of its adversary:

| of separation between Union men and Nulliflcrs
would most probably differ now from what it wan
in *32, but it cannot be obliterated. Some individuals,
perhaps many, have, on deliberate and dispassionate
investigation, changed their opinions,
i The present arrangement of men into parties, too,
; is very different from what it was ten years ago,
and might, owing to the controlling influence of
j party association upon men of weak and even
i common minds, determine the position of not a
few. There are others, perhaps many, who would
choose their position from considerations of mere
interest or policy. We remember to have heard
some such remark as the following ascribed not
very long since to a man of some distinction in the
State, namely: that he was once found with a ;
minority of the State in a bitter party contest, but
j that he would take care never to be so found again,
j There are men of such principles in all communities,
j Notwithstanding these and other causes of change,
i however, there are very many men of both parties
who understood and still hold the principles for
! which they contended so earnestly and manfully in
! 1832, and who if driven either to maintain or re-j
nounce these principles, could take no other stand
' than the one which they took before. Neither
i party ever renounced their principles, although inj
dividuals belonging to each have done so. But j
: wc trust the time will never come when the parties
shall again be arrayed in opposition to each other, j
i-ict no one raisunuersiana or misrepresent us us j
j cither seeking to revive the Nullification contest, *
, or any of the feelings connected with it; or as ad.
I vocating a protective tariff. We do neither. So
far from seeking to revive the Nullification contro.
versy, no one could deprecate it more. Our aim is ;
j only to prevent it, inasmuch as the subject has ;
j been introduced in another quarter. And the on
: ly tariff which we advocate is a revenue tariff in J
I preference to a direct tax.. The only protection ,
; to manufactures which we advocate, is that ichich j
! is merely incidental to a revenue tariff, laid with i
I a wise and discriminating regard to the best interests
of the whole country and all its parts. Such
. a tariff makes no one pay more than his fair pro|
portion of what is necrsBjry to the support of the
[ Government, and this he is allowed to pay in the i
| easiest way possible.
These remarks were written and partly in type
j for last week's paper, but excluded for want of
! room.
Pre Dee Agricultural Society,
Tiie attendance of members at the late meeting
of the Pee Dee Agricultural Seciety was good, but
I the competitors for the premiums otfered were few.
! Either premiums ought to be higher, or something !
! else ought to be done to excite more of a spirit of com- ;
I petition among the members. The exhibitton of cat- j
J tic, though not what it ought to be as to numbers, J
j was highly respectable as to the gcncal appear- i
ancc and great excellence of the animals exhibited.
Wc think they would compare advantageously with :
the same number of cattle to be found in any part
of the State. Mr. John Springs exhibited a beau
t.ful thorough bred Durham Dull, four years old,
> which took the premium for the best bull over two
years, In color he is roan. ' In quarters, body,!
j thorax, brisket, and limbs lje is not often equaled '
| even by the Durhams. The only drawback upon
| h'.s beauty is that he is not quite as straight in the i
mises that wc have abjured the doctrine of Nullifi- |
cation. We have seen its dangerous tendencies
and have determined to have nothing more to do
with it. We caught the disease at a period when
it was prevailing as an epidemic in South Carolina,
and when our blood was a little hotter than it
is at present,?persons with warm blood, it was
thought then, had a predisposition to the disease.
Ten years, however, has cooled the temperature
of ours wonderfully, and calm reflection has eradicated
all its effects upon our system. We have
the pleasure, moreover, of knowing a great num. ,
ber of brother Nullificrs (many of them good t
Democrats too) that took the disease at the same '
time wc did, who are now entire!) cureJ of it."

The laws of the State of New York provide that
if a citizen shall leave the State for the purpose of
giving or receiving a challenge, and shah then
give or receive a challenge, he shall be punished
as though the offence had been committed in the
State. The indictment charged Webb with only
leaving the State with intent to give or receive a
challenge, which in itself is no offence at all in the
eye of the law. It wa\ as one of the judges expressed
it, no more than an allegation that he had
driven n pair of grays to Harlem and back, for
which the law provided no punishment, and for
which the court could, therefore, pass no sentence.

Electro-Magnetic Telegraph. The N.
Y. Commercial Advertiser in a notice of the
Euir of the American Institute, held in the city
of New York last week and week before, has
I the following remarks up'!n this instrument:
I Nothing perhaps in fho fair attracts
more general attention than the electromagnetic
telegraph of Professor Morse.
One of the registers is placed at the end
of the cloth room nearest to Prince street,
whence the wire runs to the other regis
ter in the gallery outside of the main satoon.
These registers are each about a
cubic foot in dimensions, ancj in appearance
they ure not unlike small models of
a single cylinder Napier press. On the
front of the machine is a metallic point,
and directly by it a small vessel containing
quicksilver. When the point js dip
ped ir? this a bright spark is emitted, and
by the galvanic action on the wire a marking
machine at the other extremity is put
in motion, bv which certain arbitrary
signs denoting letters or figures are imprinted
on u large slip of paper as it rolls
over n cylinder.
The impression is made on the paper by
a sort of little hammer, which plays up
nnd down as the galvanic current is broken
or renewed by placing the point in
the quicksilver; upon its face are we be.
lieve four points shaped like a period (.).
If the point is dipped in the liquid and immediately
withdrawn, is
the mark left on the paper. If the point
is kept in longer the hammer slides over
the paper and the marks are longer, thus
| | J | ; and the longer the point is
kept in the longer are the marks. By the
different length nnd arrangement of these
marks all the letters of tho alphabet and 1
the numerals are indicated. For instance

Squirrels, and a Sign of a Hard
Winter.?The Detroit Advertiser says a
squirrel hunt took place near that city last
week, Thursday. The total killed was
3360. Other papers notice liko wholesale
slaughters. The squirrels seem to
abound this fall in unusual profusion all
over the country. For somo weeks past
the woods in (he neighborhood of Fort
Erie, across the river, have literally
swarmed with them* Within the past
week or two, they have crossed the Ningara
to this side in immense numbers.?
The rapidity and width of the river have,
of course, proved fatal to many of them;
but little armies of them have, ncvcrtheless,
succeeded in gaining our shore,
whence they pushed oft* South. On the
Allegany river, we are told, they are so
numerous, that it is not deemed worth
w hile to waste powder and shot in killing
them. Those wishing a squirrel pie,
stand on the bank of the stream, and
knock tho little "varmint" on the head
with a stick as they swim across. This |
apparent general emigration of the squirrels
to the South is held hy the Indians,
and others knowing in such matters, to
betoken a hard winter.

post office regulation.
We are requested to give publicity to
the following regulation of the Post Office
Department. It was ordered by Mr.
Wickliffe several weeks since, in consequence
of the discharge of a mail boy,
proved upon the trial to have robbed the
mail, because of his tender years and his
presumed want of sufficient knowledge of !
the difference between right and wrong in !
the matter. To establish a legal and
moral accountability to protect the mail
against the depredations of those who ore
thus suffered to escape the punishment
denounced by law, the employment in tho
service of the Donartment of lads of such
i 7 " "" " . 1
immature years is forbidden.it will bo seen
be the Postmaster General.
" Ordered, That no person tinder the
age of 10 years bo employed as a mail
carrier on any post route, or a clerk in any
Post Office in the United States. The
better to enforce this regulation, it is required,
that tho ages of the carriers and
clerks be entered upon tho oaths of offices i
which they respectively take, before they j
arc transmitted by the Contractor or Post !
Master to the Department for file. And j
the Special Agents of the Department will ;
promptly report all instances of non-compliance
with this regulation."

Bear it in mind, and vote accordingly*

arc just as sac rod to God and the Amen-'
can constitution as those of a rich man.
