It Is statoil as a statistical fact to be r
relic:*, on that in Great Britain, there are ; f
three millions of people who owe their c
me ins of support to labor bestowed in i
so ue form, on cotton produced in the
U.iied States,?Seeing this it is nrg el c
thau any great irregularity or failu e in
th^ price or supply, could not fail to p o- \
duce ser ous agitation if not convu'si >n i e
in that island:?and hence is infer.ed I i
the constant anxiety on the part of t <at s
Government, to put an end, as far as a
p-ssible, to all dependence for the raw t
material on the productive capacities of a
any people not under its dominion. Na? t
tural as may appear such a desire, to give c
all possible encouragement by the Gov- p

lire conclusion of the treaty between L rd
Paimerstoo and Gen. Hamilton, recognis. t
ing the independence of Texas, without
any reservation against slavery, in a i
country so extensive, so fertile, and so t
well adapted to the growth of cotton, c
would seem to contradict the idea of any |
such fixed and long sighted policy; as it {
seems also to be at war wi'h her own j
roprwtircK for the extinction of slavery in r
(ho British West Indies. For ourselves
we are nothing loalli to believe, that the i
\ oung Rpjuiblic on our borders owes much i
in that, as in other important foreign ne- }
goliations, to the superior vigila ice and sa- t
gacity of her young. Diplomatist, (
whose career has been marked equally bv ,
energy an 1 ad Iress, in a degree une.v m- <
pied under so many discouragiogcircum (
stances, and highly auspicious for the for- i
tunes of the country he represents as well f
as, we hope, his own. But that as it may j
it behoves us to look the qucs*ion full in <
the fare. It is not by blinking it that we j
ran understand the real state of the case,
or be the better prepared either to avert (
or to submit to its results. From a source >
professedly hostile to the existence of j
slave labor, and. doubtless anxious to see f
its prophecies realised in its own day, |
we extract some statements with the ne- j ^
ductions of the writer, which invite the. j
attention as well of the practical planter} c
as of the political inquirer. Fas est ah j
hos'e (loceri is a sound maxim in po'i.ics | fl
and in war. j q
" WjJI known cotton statistics go to t
show, i^jjlhe total amount of the cotton t
-exoort from this country to Britain in a
1840, was 1,245.000 bags, of which 343 .- [
642 were from the Atlantic States. The j
cotton imported into Britain the same t
year, from India, amounted to 216,495? v
about one-half the export from the Atlan- j
tic States. In 1834, it was only 88.122, a
so that during the last seven years, it has (
increased 128,373, or at the rate of 145 t
per cor . In 1834, the export from the a
Uui d Slates to England, was 731,235, f
and its increase during the last seven r
years has be? n 5136,492. at the rate of j
70 p r cent. So that, Indian ootto in ^
tf e British market (savs the Phi anthro >- f
i-4) has gained considerable cn mat of a
Ana rica." p
The British possessions in the East v
Indies embrace a territory nearly as '\x- a
tensive as Europe, with a popula' on of v
150 000 000 of ingenious people ; pre e of (
labor varying from Id. to 3d. a day. a d t
the cotton they consume to compi ted to ( u
exceed the crop ?>f the United States. t
In answer to I he supposition, that 'he f
quality of the cotton of India fort'i s t e ?
f ar that she can supply the wants of he c
Bm isli manufacturer, even if the quantity c
could be produced ; the writer be for us j
relies on the auth nrity o various travel- |
!er>, to whose testimony it would he worse ^
than foolish for the political economist (
and statesman, not to say the provident s
planter, to shut his eyes,?Some of these t
follow: ,
Major General Briggs, who spent i f
thirty two years in India, explored almost {
every part of it, and administered the j
affairs of government, inscveral provinces, |
says? }
* With respect to the means India pos- (
scsscs for growing cotton, it is necessary \
to consider the extent of the country, the f
nature of the soil, its vast population, the {
.description of their clothing, and the pur- j
poses to whic h cotton is applied, before (
we can have any conception of the gre at
capabilities it has of supplying not only I
England, hut the whole world if neccs i
sn'v.'*?\nd again he says?,l We think
or.oti :K his iioen said to shew, that there | ^
is neither want of cotton soil for the indi- ^
genous nor the American plant, and we|
- < ! . it . I 1 I
may tvun commence assert, hs me mh>? iedge
of soils aii< 1 climate becomes more
and more stupid and attended to that lit.; ^
din will prove capable of producing cot- ^
ton of any quality ; and to any extent."
Dr. S.nrav, a botanist, one of the Com- i
S
party's servants in Bengal, recently sta-] .
ted before the Royal Asiatic Society? |j
" It is certainly without a parallel in ?
the annals of the world, that a country
possessing such capacities as India, should
have been so long hot metrically sca'ed a- j
gainst the enterprise of Britons, in order t
to prolong the abuses of patronage. Had j
1 tie peninsula been open, we should not
ltow be dependant upon America for raw f
cotton, nor would the country have been
brought, as it was four years ago, to the |
very verge of bankruptcy and revolution,
when the stock of cotton was not adequate
. I It . rn . i f
to tnree wa-K s consumption, lo this '
reminding blunder the Southern division j.
of the United States owes its cotton plan- ^
talions. and its lico-fields, arid also the ^
blighting course of Slavery. Evidence *
confirms the fact, that cotton can be
grown in India, fully equal, or rather su- J
perior, to the bulk of American."
Kirkman Finally, Esq., in a commnni- j
ration to the ChairilKr of Commerce, _
Manchester, says? "
" India is a country of such vast re- j
sources, with such abundance of scil ad- ,
apted to the cultivation of cotton, such a (
MBj?
n?riety of climate. nnd such an immense er
aboring (population, that it appears of all Fc
)thers, best fitted to become a cotton- |
growing country, nnd to send an article ^
>f the finest quality, and in the greatest , m
ibundance." ! R
Mr. John Gladstone, an authority in to
iomtnercial matters, says? d.i
" For the supply of the raw material ,
ve are almost wholly dependent on for- I .!
sign countries, whilst we . a eand possess
n the British dominions in India. re;0 irces P
utficient to MippIv all we require an I to sp
in in -leased extent if demanded jjresources w
hat are within our influence and control, hr
nd where the only limit to the con*ump- or
ion of British manufactures ts the ability <
?f the natives to pay for them ; whilst we j
>ossess at the same time the means to j.j,
timulate and increase our intercourse n
vith safety aud advantage to the empire df
it large." cr
Mr. George Ash1, r or, in a paper read
* * 1 ^ -.^4.. ??Arno rlro
>etore me asihiic oooiuiy, iunnin?o? j ,)f
"Labor in central India is cheaper than j rr
n almost any o'her portion of the world ; i [
he wages of an ahle-hedied man being ni*
inly throe rupees [six shillings sterli-g il><
ier month. It has been estimated, therj- .
'ore, that ticrar cotton may be cultivated
irofitably for 30 rupees per candy, < r for ^
ather than a penny a pound !"
The next question for the American J;
nvestigator of a question of the deej>est
nterest is. what obstacles have prevented
he development of capabil ties in India n
o supply the country under whose government,
she groans, with an article from ti
vliich. were she suddenly cut off, tlx; very fJ
existence of that government would be f
indange e . An answer to this inquiry t?
n the view of the writer before tis will he j?1
bund in the extracts which follow, ri
ind if well founded would appear to ac- !'
munt fully, as well for deficiency of sup- ,j
)lv. as for defectiveness of quality.
In our next we shali present the views i si
>f this pains taking writer as lothe men- sri
aires and causes which mav he expected tr
o operate in the removal of the ohsiaeles t?l
ere designah d. and to insu e to Great (''
Britain an ample supply of this great sta- >p
lie of our slave holding St tes "rom a rcg. tr
on under her own controul, and of a B
(uality to meet all demands. I??
** Thi-h^iivw.v-A" t?COtlon- J?
growing in the East, and indeed the great ^
'ause of most of the evils of In la, lies in ra
he nature of the government that conrol
its destinies?a government which m
icts, not for the benefit of its subjects, i m
>ut the aggrandizement of itself. Wres ?
ng from the natives the proprietorship of ct
he soil, it imposes on them taxes under ,
vhich no people could flourish. It sul. !
er's them to a system of forced labor ! tj,
md purveyance, which, allowing no se- or
:urity for property, takes awav the motive th
0 its accumulation. The insolence, exictions
and cruelties of its officers in ma ly
ases leaves no refuge to the m c
able native but absolute poverty. Noth- w
ng scarcely is planned or? x u'rd f< r the if
;ood or the country ; a few nabobs think gs
hemselves entitled to coin money out of bl
1 hundred mil'ion people, though their
rlicw so far as the accun ul ition of 1
irralth is concerned, is scarcely so wise
rrn ^
s the slave system o' tie South. The pr
irtual assumption by the government of ev
he proprietorship of the soil, is the root of ist
he mischief. It has proclaimed itself the FO
iriversal landlord, and affirm d its right lnl
o take from its tenants what it will. Be- a"
ore the country came under British rule, fi,
h Hindoo or 3/ahommedan sovereign 0f
laimed as a ix a iinnt d portion or ilie ' he
:rop of every man's field, leaving not loss ! u'
han three-fourths to the farmer. The i P1
3ri?i.-h government takes the whole mat- j j?|
cr into its own hands?fixes an assumed j
apahilify in every field to produce, an as- I
;uni"d price of the produce itself, and j er
hen exacts from 35 to 45 per cent, of the wl
coney value of that produce as its share i ee
or ever;?and all this, without any re- I
erence to varying crops or prices ! When i
ke produc exceeds the amount previous- !
vf fix> d, the assessment is increased, i ar
tVhen an individual fails, in the payment ! tli
if his tax. it is collected off the village, i ;ii
iVhcn the crop of a whole village is de- ' th
icient, neighboring villages are compelled U l
omako up the deficiency. 45 parts in a jf:'
100 of the gross produce of the soil are j 1
aken hv the government. As to the I at

Hinois. And yet the same year, as \
nueii g"oin was exported from the low< ? pj
>arts of Bengal, as would have fed half a
nillion of people, at a pound of rice a day ur
or a whole year. The Oriental Herald
or February, 1839. states, that" in 1819 sj,
here were 19.,G76.076 heegas or aboti
558.692 acres of waste land, in tie p
rovinces where half a million ofhutnai w

The pertinacious adherence of the Board of dl
irectors to this ruinous system, seems to a- tr
i>un? to madness. In the year 1335. Sir r]
obert Grant issued a proclamation, offering j
those who would cultivate waste land, free, j 'a'
