Chancellor Harper, from the Commit
tee of 21, reported to the Conventtion with
some additions and amnendments, the Reso
lutions introduced on Monday tby General
H ayne, and referred to their consideration.
Gen. H ayne, from the same Committee,
read a Report of great length and interest,
embracing generally all the subjects of the
Resolutions.
Mr. King, from the saime Committee,
made a Report on the subject of taxing
stock in trade. It concludes witht a re
commendation to te several States so to
modify their laws as to lay taxes ontom
merce, upon the income of the merchant
inistead at his stock in trade, and some very
cogent reasons were given for this chang~e.
Cal. Blanding, from the same Comn
mittee, made a verbal sta'enment respect
ing the prospect of estalishitng a Southtertn
Review, lie said the former Review was
suistained for for years, on an effective
subscription for otnly 1300) copies. Of these,
Charleston took 500-the rest of the State
500 more, and the other 300 wvere distri
bitted variously among the States ; that of
places out of the State, Savannah contri
bhtted most. It was believed that now
wvith 2000 eff'ective subscrihers, thme Re
view would sustatin inself, anad the amne
general interest niow felt in the subject,
warranted the belief .that such a number
could lhe obtained. A proposition to es
tablish the Review, was to he presented
to the members of the Convention for cir
culation trough their several States, and
a Committee was recoitmended, with au
thority to act upon the~ result.
Without acting upon the Reports, the
Convention then, on motion of Judge
Longstreet. adjourned to meet at 10 o'clock
to-day.
-ARIL 18.
The Convention met according to ad
jourinmient, at 10 o'clock, yesterday. A f
ter the reading of the minutes of the last
meeting,
Col. A. P. Hlayne olTered a rcsolntionm,
before submitting whtch to the action of
the Convention, he addressed that hod v in
suppsort of it, atnd drew a strona and atni
mating picture of thme good effects which
have already resulted to the South from
the holding of Commercial Conventions
The resolution was unanimously adopted
and is ar, follows:
Resolved, That this Convention recomn
mend to the people of the South and S.
Western States, to appoint Delegates to
State of Georgia, on the first Monday of
May, 1840, !o continue :o present the in
icrests and objects of this Convention be
fore the people, and that separate and dis
tinct Cotimitecs, to be composed of Dele
gates from each Statt, and Territory pres
ent, be appoimted by the President of this
Convettion, whose duty it sliall lie to take
all proper measures to ensure a full repre
sentation from every part of those States,
and whose duty it shall also be to attend
the mneetings of the Legislatures of their
respective Staies for the ptirpose of pro
noting by all proper and laudable means
the objects of this Convention.
A motion was theni made to take up the
Report of the Committee of21, previous
to the vote on which, Judge Longstreet
arose to submit a series of Resolutions ad
ditional to those of the: Comminitee, the oh
ject of which was to set oi foot an organ.
ized and practical phi for proinoting in
vestments by the planters of the interior in
linited copartnerships. For this purpose
the Delegates lirom ich section were to
lie made a Committee to act in such see
Lun. Hie pointed out clearly and convin
cingly the necessity of going beyond argu
ment aid Contvenion-heucefbrth to make
talking only subsidiary to actio...
The Resolutions of the Cotittee of
21 were then taken op and unaninously
adopted: When the last Resolution rela
ting to a Southern Review came up for
consideration, Col. Blanding proposed ana
amendment, providing for the appoint
tent ofa Committee to carry itsobject
into effect. Judge Lontgstrect, oplposed] the
R-solution as not suitable fbr the action of
the Convention, but expressed the warm
est interest iu the estabiftnent of the
Review.
A general Debate followed which con
suned the whole day. A motion was fi
inIlly made to lay the resolution on the ta
tile. The vote was takent by States, and
the majority of the Delegaaion of each
State voted int the negative. The only
votes in the allirmative were fruom South
Carolina ai Georgia. So the States
utianiously voted nuot to lay the resoln
tiou oat ahe table. It was then adopted by
an overihelmting majority, aid the Cou
vention adjourned to meet to-day at 10
U'clock.
We shall endeavor at another time to
give a sketch of this discussion, not be
cause nany and eminent men igaged iu
it, but the subject is of interest, aid the
practical consequences oi the resolution
are likely to be of vast importauce.
The following are the Resolutions re
ported by the committee of 21, and adopt
ed yesterday by the Convention.
1st. Resolved, That, in the opinion of
this Conveution, the present state of our
trade, by which tihe supplies of foreign
-nods, received in exchange for the produc
tions of the Southern and South Westeru
States, are chiefly obtained through the
cities of the North, is highly injurious to
the citizens of these States, and we are
therefore called upon by every considera
tion of duty and patri-tism to correct the
evil.
2d. Resolved, That as the producers
of the great staples whirh constitute the
basis of the foreign commerce (if the Union,
it is right and proper that iwe should enjoy
a fair share of [ie profits of that cori
nerce, of which, however, we have here.
tofore been deprived by the unequal atiion
(if the Federal Government, and the too
exclusive devotion of our own citizens to
other pursuits.
3d. Resolved, That, in order to scrure
to these States, the inestimable advanta
ges of a direct import and export trade,
cominenstorate with their resources and
their wants, it is. in the opinion of this
Conivention, indispentsably ntecessary, that
the public imid should be enlightenaed otn
this sitbject' by fuall atnd free discus~sions,
aitd that a general synpathy should be
enlisted, and harmony of feeling and con
cerlt of action secured, by eaarneet sand re
iterated appeals to the public spirit of our
fellow-citizens.
4th. Resolved, That the progress al
ready miade itn this work, as nmatnifestedl by
the wise legislation of several of the States
-in the deep and growing interest every
where felt upon the subject-the great in
crease of our foreign anid domestic ttade,
andI the number of mnerchanits from the in
terior who now obtain their supplies from
our own ports, affords great 'encourage
ment foi the continuance of our efforts,
anid should urge us on, with renewed zeal,
energy and perseverance.
5ith. Resolved that the following mecas
ures are, in the opinint of this Convention,
necessary to be adopted for the purpose of
ensurmgi ouir success, viz:
1st. That the commerciatl capital and
credit of the Somuth anid South Western
States shtouldl be so extended and enlharged
as to entable otur merchants to carry on
the business of direct importations on an
extetnsave scale and on the most advanita
geous termis.
2. That for this purpose, it is highily
impor tant that a portion of the capital niow
absorbed in other pursuits, should lie di
rected to commercace, fo~r which the strong
est inducements are nr~w offered by the
piassage of Jaws in several States, au
thorizinog limited co-part ntershuips, and from
the reasonable assutranace that such invest
moents will he as profitable to. ipidividu
als as they must be beneficial to the corn
nmanity.
3. That our Banks should extend all
the aid in their power to this trade, aind af
ford -all the necessary facilities for carrying
it oat successfully, by enlarging the captitail
and extending the credit of those who may
engage in it, to the antmost extent, consis
teat witb the safety ofthese institutions and
the public welfare.
4th. Thatt the proper efforts should also
be made to bring in foreign capital atid
credit, in aid of the resources of our coutn
try, and that for this puirpose suittahle a
gents should be sent abroad, to induce for
eign capitalists and merchants, to establish
atgencies and foram no-partnerships in our
cities, with the asiurance of their receiving
a cordial welcome, and zealous sutpport.
5th. That similar efforts should be made
to liring about-a co-operation, bet ween our
Merchants and Capitalists, and those of
Euarope, for the puarpose of itimediately
establishing lines of Packet Ships and
Steamers, wrhereby regular eomtmunica
lions, at stated periods, may be secured
and that all other menares should he a
dopted to eflect as speedily as possible
this all important subje'ct.
6th. That in the opinion of this Conven
tion, it is essential to the success of any
scheme of direct importation, that a de
mand should be created in our own ports
ror all the goods so imported, which can
only be efected by opening free commu
nications with the interior, by an exten
sive system of Rail Roads, Canals and
Turnpikes, by which the merchants of the
interior may he enabled to lay in their
supplies on better terms than they could
procure them from any otherquarter.
7th. That a Cotitnittee of five be ap
pointed in each of the States represented,
to carry out and effect as far as practica
ble, the measures represented by the Con
vention.
Git. Resolved, That we regard the
trade between the ports of the South and
South-Western States, and-all other ports
of the Union as governed by the satne
pritciples which are applicable to our for
eign trade, and while the sante shall con
sist in the exchange of our productions for
those of other States, as entitled to our
support. But in this, as in the foreign
trade, we regard a direct importation in
our own ships, through our own resident
merchants, as essential to enable us to en
joy all the benefits of this intercourse.
7th. That aumong the measures auxil
liaty to the important objects we haO in
view, this Convention cannot but regard
as of deep interest and importance. the
adoption of the proper means for intirodu
cing commercial education among the
youth of our country-he training them
up to habits of business, and thereby es
tablishing a body of merchantswhose eve
ry interest and feeling shall be identified
with the country who has reared and sus
tained them.
8th. Resolved, That in the opinion of
this Convention, the establishment of a
Southern Review under the direction of
able and learned men, to be faithfully de
voted to the promotion of science and lit
erature, qnd also to the defence of the in
stitutions, the vindication of the rights and
development of the resources of the Slave
holding States, is an object of the deepest
interest and one which should command
the cordial co-operation and support of
every citizen of these States.

We have several Conimunitations on
hand, which are necessarily excluded for
the want of room. We will publish them
as soon as we can. "Iconoclast" lacks the
authority of a name. Will the author favor
us with it! We take this opportunity to
suggest to all Correspondents, who may
favor us with their Communicatious, to at
tach their names thereto. It is contrary
to the rule of all editors, so far as our
knowledge extends, to publish articles
which have not responsible signatures ap
pended. The propriety of this rule must
strike every one with great force.
The arrival of the Great Western has
created quite an excitement in the Cotton

Fire in Charleston.-A fire broke out in
Chaleston on the night of the 19th inst.
"It comtnenced as we learned," says the

about eight buildings, all of wood, on the

The Legislature of Maryland has passed

Neto York Citg .Election.-Greatly to
the sttrprise of both parties, the Demo

for Officers in the City of New York.
They have elected Mr. Varian, Mayor, by
about 1100 votes, and they have also elee
ted a large majority of' the Common Coun

The Democrats have a tmajority of 12

The New York American and N. York
Courier advocate the claims of General

effected, in a great degree, by his agen~cy.
Brooklyn C'ity E'lection.-New York pa

place in Brooklyn, on the 9th inst. The

FLORIDA.
We -make the following extracts'from
Letters % ritten by a resident of Florida, to
-certain gentlemen of this neighborhood.
"Jefferson County, M. Florida,
April 8th, 1839.
The public Journals have-no doubt in
formed you, that the t heatre of savage war
fare has been changed from the everglades,
cyprus ponds, &c. to the delightful settle
mients of Middle Florida. Blood and car
nage have marked their footstepis. Scarce
ly a week but brings in its course, or at its
close, the dreadful and heart-rending intel
ligence, that yet another confiding family
is offered up to appease the insatiate crav
ings or some demon God.
How long shall this devouring serpent. de
spoil this flowery Eden? How long shall a
band of lawless savages, defy this Govern
ment. and sport with the lives of its dep
fenceless inhabianots? The annals of the
world from the earliest strifes and feuds of
Gauls. and Vandals,-down to the present
moment, cannot produce a single parallel.
The death of one citizen by another power,
was considered by the Roman Empire a
sufficient cause of war. Shall dollars and
cents be counted against the lives of virtu
ous and loyal citizens? The U. States are
able to cut down every bush in Florida,
and destroy this band of murderers in three
months. But enough.
Deep and general excitement pervades
this County. Scarcely a man goes, even
on his plantation without arms, and no one
can point out the next victim. Some have
fled the country, some are forted, while
others have fled to Monticello, and other
places of supposed security, for the protec
tion of their families, and perhaps before
this imperfect sketch reaches the kind
friend for whom it is intended, another,
and yet another of these bloody tragedies
may be acted in unfortunate Florida!
Should a war with Great Britain suc
ceed the ruin of Florida will be complete.
A country tnat has about as many blacks
as whites, and already greatly annoyed by
the most war-like savages, known in the
world, could not sustain itself; when, in
addition to the above, there are hordes of
Privateers, and West India Pirates, and
well appointed British Officers, and train
ed regulars to co-operate with and lead on
to battle, these indefatigable Indians.
Fate has fixed my destiny here for the
present, and I cannot think of flying the
country and leave my property thus ex
posed; and to remove my negroes at this
time, would, as I inentioned in a letter to
another friend. subject me to a sacrifice of
from 12 to 15 thousand dollars, for I must
lose my growing crop, about 3000 bushels
of old corn, and every thing that I should
leave behind, would be burnt up and de
stroyed by the Itdians. I have therefore
come to the conclusion, to remain here and
defend my property to the last extremity.
I have a strong and well constructed Fort,
and so has my son, and we will endeavor
to defend them as men contending for life,
property and reputation."
"April 7.
Onlast Wednesday night a party of In
dians attacked the house of Capt. Scou,
about 18 or 20 miles to the S. W. of this
place, and succeeded in killing a visiting
lady,[M rs.Perrine,] and a negro woman, &
wounding a little son of Col. Win. Bailey,
who with his mother was on a visit. Capt.
Scott and another gentleman were sit
ting in the back piazza, when the Indians
fired into the house; these gentlemen in
stantly ran into the room, and each of them
seized a gun just as the first Indian sprang
into the house. Captain Scott shot him
down, and he fell his whole length on the
loor, The other Indians, who had heen
striving to enter the house, drew him otnt,
leaving his gun behind, and ran off with
him, while the other gun was discharged
at the whole group within a very short dis
tance. it is believed, from the signs of
blood and the short distance, that one.
t wo, or three were severely wounded, and
perhaps one of them killed. They retreat
ed as fast as they could carry the dead
andI wounded. This gang is supposed to
contain 35 Indians. It is saidl that fresh
signs have been recently discovered in a
place called the Brier-patch, within about
five miles of Monticello, and that a large
body of citizens were to meet this day for
the purpose of scouring it."
Congressional Candidates.--The edi -
tors of the Western Carolinian, in an ar
ticle upon the candidates for Congress in
North Carolina, say:
"We have received the Circulars of sever
al of our late Representatives in Congress:
some of them declaring themselves candid.
ates for re-election-others say nothing
about it, and our late member, Mr. Ren
cher, seems to leave the matter in dotubt,
'is may be seen in his Circular extensively
diffused amnong the people. He, however

should be very sorry to think that our Dis
trict is so destitute of competent men as
to he under the necessity of forcing Mr.
Reacher to hold on contrary to his wish
es-particularly, as he bus already occu
pied the station ten years.
"We have had some opportunities of
ascertaining public sentiment on this sub
ject, and we kaye seen no disposition a
mong the people to force Mr. Rencher to
hold on; we lhelieve, so far as our knowl
edge extends, they are willing to gratify
his wihbes, and excuse him from further
public servico."
It must be confessed, that these editors
treat this great matter of resignation, very
coolly. rt is certain that neither theX, nor
the constituents of th.e Honorable Mr.
Rencher, attach much importance to his
continuatnce in office. They do not think
that the existence of North Carolina de
pends upon it. They are perfectly wil
ling for their Representative to stay at
home. They think that they can dispense
with his valuable services, thou h be.seems
to think that they cannot. lli' alas!
this is an ungrateful world. .Here .is a
politician who has served his constituents
duritig the whole siege of Troy, and they
are now wvilling to disriess him! They

Parties in Great Britain..in the .pli
ical relations now existing between Great
Britain, and. the United States, a correct
account of the state of parties in the or
nier country, cannot but be of great im;
portance, and interest, to the people of
the-latter. In the present state of al'airs.
especially, it is necessary for us to have
accurate information on this subject. On
the peculiar position of parties in Great
Britain depends the continuance of friend
ly relations, between the British and A.
merican Governments.
We copy from. the Charleston Patriot
the following account of the state of par
ties as they now exist.
The real state of parties in England,.
appears to be very impertcly understood
in the United States, while it has a very
important bearing on the existing politic
al relations between the two countries.
That the Whig party have no inherent
strength, is obvious when the votes by
whieb it is sustained in the Legislature are
analyzed. We frequently behold* thb
Duke of Wellington and Sir Robert Peel,
casting their influence in favor of their po
litical adversaries, the Whigs, in Parlia
ment, while they are employing all-thew.
power to defeat them out of it. Strip the
Whigs of the ondasional support they de
rive iom the Conservatives, that which
they obtain from the Radical party, :and
that which they borrow from the 'rish
members under the infhrence. of* Mr.
O'Connell, and it would be reduced to the
mere skeleton of a party. is easily ex
plained why the Conservativesvote occa
sionally with the Whigs. It is with them
merely a choice of evils. They prefer the
Whigs as a class of Destructives less in
jurious than the Radicals. The sweeping
reforms that would attend-the possession
of power by the latter, would destroy the
British Constitution. in the. opinion of the
Conservatives,. They sustain, the Whigs,
therefore, to prevent the'admission to of
fice and - power, of the Radicals, undia
measures are ripe for their own succes
sion.
That this position of parties has anim.
portant bearing on the existing political.
relations between the United-Statesaitid"
Great Britain, is evident dn i ryait &
reflection. The Tories are, as far as
concerns this country, most - essentially
the war party. It would gladden their
hearts to behold the United States so torn
by intestine feuds, or so weakened- in
iheir union and resources by a foreiga
war, as to deprive them of their influence
as an example of successful republican
ism. The improvements in steam are
likely to give greater force to such an ex
ample, in Europe, by the frequency and
rapidlity of intercourse, while our pros
perity is unimpeded. For the very same
reason, the reform party in Great Britain
(particularly the ultra portion of it) wish
that example to work its full ef'ects, with
no impediment from European 'interfer
ence. Btut this remark .applies iwith im
creased force to Mr. O'Connell and his
pat.Thyhl the balance of power

States would not only turn back the tide*
of general reform, but interfere with those.
particular reforms in Ireland, which are'
only as yet in thpir infancy, in the con
ternplation of Mr. O'Connell and his ad.:
herents.~ His utmost influence, therefore,
it is rational to conclude, will be thrown
into the scale of peace, and as his sixty
votes in the House of Commons tell so
well on a division, we have an assurane.
in this position of parties in England, that
our pacific relations wvith that country will
receive no present interruption.
France and Mzico.-The Convention en

Mexican Commisstioner, has' been ratified by
the Mexican Government unconditionally.
This arrangemont settles -the dispute with
France. Admiral Bandin announced his inten

vious to his departure, on his return to.Franco.
The news of the odicial ratification reached
Vera Cruz, on the25th March. The Lenini

Mexico, states that Santa Anna, (who is Presi

the treaty. This sum joined with the threats
of Admiral Baudin to act with rigor, and the
