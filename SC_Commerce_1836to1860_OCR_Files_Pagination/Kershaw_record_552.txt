Washington, August 15.
Abouta hundred members of the House,
accompanied by the Heads of Department,
and many officers of the Government,
visited the Delewrare yesterday,
below Annapolis, and met with a brilliant
reception and entertainment front Com.
Morris. The President was expected to
be one of the party, but the cares of State
did not permit him to go.
^ The Senate had also referred to go, to
the great annoyance of some of its Members.
The most important matter i* the Sen_v:
<; -alev yesterday, was a Message from the
.President. nnf with ?bw ?r~~
poseiir.\vnen the Secretary came in, but
tlie Bill repealing the Sub Treasury Act.
"Signed and approved by the President."
So the Sub Treasury, after a brief and
stormy existence, is defunct, and with it,
its predecessor, the Pet Bank system,
which Congress thought fit t.? include in
llje same sentence. The third plan of
keeping .the Public Money, through a
- Bank of the United Slates, having been
adopted by Congress, is still before the
" Executive, nnd, according to all accounts,
and appearances, will not be approved.?
The President, it appears, is willing
however, to recommend and approve a
Fiscal Agent, which shall facilitate the
financial operations of the Government,
and, at the same lime, afford ineontesta,
blv, some facilities to commerce and secure
a uniform currency. This plan, it is
, i said, will toe a Bank of deposite, issue,
i?and exchange, tout which shall be restrict;^'ed
from discounting notes, or lending mn"
ney. Many who voted for the Bill, which
is now before the President, would also
vote for such a Bank as this; hut it is
< thought that it will be impossible to get up
such a measure and pass it through all the
stages of legislation at this session. The
feeling of Congress is against any further
action at this session on the subject. Sh?,
for the present, We shall go on with a
Treasury unregulated by Jaw. The Pre
sident may keep the Public Mone) in the
Banks, or in the hands of individual de
positories, as he may please; and th*> kind
* ? ol fuuds taken for the public dues will he

i- VETO OF THE BANK BILL.
I. To the Senate of the United Slates:
o The bill entitled "An art to incorpor
o ale the snbsc ihers to the Fiscal Bank o!
e the United States," which originated ir
it the Senate, has been considered hv me
o with a sincere desire to conform my ac'.ior
if in regard to it, to that of the two Houses
- of Congress. By the Constitution it it
it1 made my duty, either to approve the bill
d hy signing it, or to return it with my ohe
jections, to the House in which it origin!
ated, i cannot conscientiously give it my
e approval, and 1 proceed to discharge the
it duty required of me by the Constitution

I, The |io\ver of rrss 1" create a Naf?
tion.il Bank to op'TaSu ]>c.r sc orer the
' Union, has been a question of dispute
11 from the origin of our (government. Men
-1 most justly and deservedly esteemed for
t tlieir high ini< llectual e dowments, their
, virtue, and their patriotism, have, ill re.
gard to it, entertained different and con*
, dieting opinions. Congresses have differ*
; ed. The approval of one President hu
. been followed by the disapproval of anoi
ther. The people, at different times, have
acquiesced in decisions both for and
; against. The country has been, and still

' I is, ueepiy acumen oy ini? unfcmcu ijucok
I li*in. It will suffice me to say, that my
I opinion Has been uniformly proclaimed to
hi-a>>njiist the exercise of a-iy such power
bv this Government. On all soitable occasions,
during a period of twenty-five
years, the opinion thus entertained has
been unreservedly expressed. I declared
it in the Legislature of my native Stale.?
In the House of Representalires of the
U. Slates it has been openly vindicated by
me. In the Senate Chamber, in the pre*
seure and hearing of many ? ho are at this
time members of that body, it has been
affirmed and reaffirmed, in speeches and
reports there made, and by vutes there
recorded. In popular assemblies I have
unhesitatingly announced it; and the last
public declaration which I made, and that
hut a short time before the late Presidential
election, i referred to my previously
expressed opinions as being those then
eutertai ed by me.
With a full knowledge of the opinions
thus entertained, aad never concealed, I

the United Slate*. By the occurrence
of a contingency provided for by the constitution,
and arising under an impressive
dispensation of Providence, I succeeded
to the Presidential office. Before entering
upon the duties of that office, 1 took

justly subject me to the ridicule and scum
of all virtuous men.
I deem it entirely unnecessary at this
time to enter upon the reasons which have
brought my mind to the convictions I feel1
and entertain on this subject. They have j
heen over and orer again repeated. If!
some of those who have preceded me in,
this high office have entertained and avowed
different opinions, I yield all confidence
that their convictions were sincere.
I claim only to have the same measure
meted out to myself. Without going further
into the argument, I will say that
in looking to the powers of this government
to culiect, safely keep, and disburse
the public revenue, and incidentally to
regulate the commerce and exchanges, 1
have not been able to satisfy mvsetf that
the establishment by this Government of
u Bunk of discount, in the ordinary acccp
taiiou of that term, was & necessary
means, or one demanded by propriety, to
execute those powers. What can the local
discounts of the bank have to do with
the collecting, safe keeping, and disbursing
of the revenue? So far as the mere
j discounting of paper is concerned, it is
j quite immaterial to this question whether
11lie discount is obtained as a State Bank or
a United Slates bank. They are both
j equally local?both beginning and both
| ending in a local accommodation. What
I influence have local discounts, granted by
any formofa bank, in the regulating of the
, currency and the exchanges? Let the his
lory of the late United Slates Bank aid us
in answering this inquiry:
For several years after the establish'
ment of that institution, it dealt almost
1 exclusively in local discounts, and during
that period the country was, for the most
part, disappointed in the consequences
f anticipated from its incorporation. A
r uniform currency was not provided, ex
1 changes were not reguiaieu, arid utile or
r nothing was added to the general circula8
linn; and in 1820 its embarrassments had

able every where in payment of the pubn
lie dues. It had, tip to that period, dealt
h to hut a vt-ry small extent in exchanges,
? eitlter foreign or domestic, and as late as
io 1823 its operations in that line amounted
- to a little more than seven 'millions of
it dfliHars j?er annum. A very rapid atig

" ' sV '#^r- J .

i| mentation soon after occurred, and inj
r 1833 its dealings in exchanges amounted
to upwards of one hundred millions of
dollars, including the sales of its own
drafts; and all these immense transactions
were effected without the employment ofi
extraordinary means. The currency of
f the country became sound, and the negji
ciations in the exchanges were carried on
, at the lowest possible rates, The circui
lation was increased to more than $22,000,i
000, and the notes of the bank were re
i garded as equal to specie all over the
I country; thus showing almost conclusive
ly that it was the capacity to deal in ex
changes, and not in local discounts,
' which furnished these facilities and advani
tages. It may be remarked, too, that
i noiwunsianauig ine inimt-iine nuimaiiMMis
of the hank In the purchase of exchange,
the losses sustained were merely nominal;
while in the line of <liscounts the suspended
debt was enormous, and proved most
disastrous, to thp bank and the country.
Its power of local discount has, in fact,
proved to be a fruitful source of favoritism
and corruption, alike destructive to the
general weal. J J ' ' '
The capital invested in banks of dis- ;
count in the United States, created by i
the States, at this time exceeds $350,000.- i
000; and H the discounting of loaal pa- 1
per could have produced any beneficial ef- 1
fcctg, the United States ought to possess i
- IJ. 1 *
the soundest currency in me wuriu, uui
the reverse is lamentadly the fact. J
Is the measure now under considerera- i
tinn of the objectionable character to >
which 1 have alluded? It is clearly so, I
unlpss by the 16th fundamental article of <
the 11 tit section it is made otherwise.? i
That article is in the following words; I
' The directors of the said corporation i
shall establish one competent office of |
discount and deposiie in any Slate in I
which two thousand shares shall have i
been subscribed, or* may be held, when- i
ever, upon application of the Legislature
of such. State, Congress may by law re- <
quiFe the same, And the said directors i
may also establish one or more competent I
offices of discount and deposite in any ter- ?
rilory or district of the United States, and |
in any State, with the assent of such State; s
and when established, the said office or i
offices shall be only withdrawn or removed i
by the said directors prior to the expira- t
tion of this charier, with the previous t
assent of Congress: Provided, In respect 1
to any State which shall not, at the first ?
session of the Legislature thereof, held <
after the passage of this act, by resolu- I
lion, or other usual legislative proceed- i
ing, unconditionally assent or dissent to s
the establishment of such office or offices r
within it, such assent of the said State I h
shall be thereafter presumed: And provid-,
ed nevertheless, uTliat whenever it shall l<
become necessary of proper for enrrying! a
into execution any of the powers granted t
by the Constitution, to establish an office t
or offices in any of the States whatever, ?
and the establishment thereof, shall he di- f
reeled by law, it shall be the duty of the f
i said officers to establish such offices accor- i
i ditigly." c
I It wi'l be seen by this clause, the direc- a
tors are invested with the fullest power to i
establish a branch in any State which has t
yielded its assent; and having once estah- t
lished such branch, it shall not afterwards a
be withdrawn, except by order of Con- a
gress. Such assent is to be implied, and g
to have the force and sanction of an actu- r
ally expressed assent, "provided, in re- \
spect to any State which shall not, at the i
first session of the legislature thereof, ?
held after the passage of this act, by reso c
lution. or other usual legislative proceed- v
ing, unconditionally assent or dissent to c
the establishment of such office or offices i
within it, such assent of said Slate shall c
thereafter be presumed." The assent or i
dissent is to be expressed, unconditional- j
ly> at the first session of the legislelnre,
by some formal legislative act, and if not
so expressed, its assent is to be implied,
and the directors are thereupon invested
with power, at such time thereafter as they
may please, to establish branches, which
cannot afterwards be wildrawn, except r
by resolve of Congress. No matter what ^
may bo the cause which may operate with i
the legislature, which either prevents it I
from speaking, or addresses itself toils,!
wisdom, to induce delay, its assent is toll
bcynplied. This iron rule is to givewuylr
to no circumstances?it Is unbending and ill
inflexible. It is the language of the mas-' r
ter to the vassal?an unconditional answer [ tl
is claimed forthwith; and delay, postpone- a
ment, or incapacity to answer, produces I
an implied assent, which is ever after ir- 'f
revocable. Many of the State elections h
have already taken place, without any1
knowledge on the part of the people, that ! v
such a question was to come up. The! a
Representatives may desire a submission I
of the question to their constituents, pre- 1
paratoryto final action upon it; but this L
high privilege is denied; whatever may be i
the motives and views entertained by the
representatives ol tnc people, to induce t
delay, their assent is to be presumed, and \
is ever afterwards binding, unless their t
dissent shall be unconditionally expressed i ^
at their first session after the passage of! i
this bill into a Inw. They may, by for-'(
mul resolution, declare the question of as* v
sent or dissent to be undecided and post- \
poned; and yet, in oposition to their express
declaration to the contrary, their
assent is to be implied. Cases innumerable
might be cited to manifest the iriationality
to such an inference. Let one or f
two in addition suflice. f
The popular branch of the Legislature, 1
may express its dissent by an unanimous! i
vote, and its resolution may be defeated/(
by ft .tie vote in the Senate, and yet.the 4

assent is to be implied. Both branches of Ju
the Lgislaturc may concur in a resolu- bi
lion of decided dissent, and yet the Gov- m
nor may exert the veto p'ivver conferred in
on him by the Stale Constituion, and their ir
legislative action be defeated; and yet the
assent of the legislative authority is implied,
and .the directors of this contemplated
institution are authorized to establish
a branch or brandies in such State, hi
whenever they may find it conducive to di
the interest of the stockholders to do so: fx
and having once established it, they can, dt
under no circumstances withdraw it, ex- w
cept by act of Congress. This State may St

It may be said that the directors may ra

lublic interest, their patriotism may be ly
luccessfuliy appealed to; but to infer their bo
issent from circumstances at war with Ei
nteresl, 1 caunot but regard as calcula*
ed to excite a feeling at fatal enmity with
lie peace and harmony of the country.
: must, therefore, regard this Clause as thi
isserting the power to be in Congress to au
establish officers of discount in a State, at
nit not only without its assent, but against ca
ts dissent; and so regarding it, I cannot th
auction it. On general principles, the th
ight in Congress to prescribe terms to
iny Slate, implies a superiority of pow- pci
:r and control, deprives the transaction nn
if all pretence to compact, between them, Ci
ind terminates, as we have seen, in the Cc
otal abrogation of freedom of action on no
lie part of the Slates. But further, the ihi
State may express, after the most solemn of
