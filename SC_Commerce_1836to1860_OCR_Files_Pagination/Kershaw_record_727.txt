Our legislation should also be directed
to discourage the rash and criminal indis- a
cretions of youth; among the most frequent a
and fatal of which, is that which arises out j
the toleration (if not the protection) which t
our jurisprudence, or the mode of adrmuis- 2
tering it, has hitherto extended to the prac- a
lice of duelling. Founded in the most/

tlic noblest and most honorable incentives E
of the human mind, the judicious corrections
of its evils and abuses is an object of i;
as much importance to the peace and liar- e
mony ol society, as the manner of effecting e
it must be acknowledged to be both diffi- F
cult and delicate. If it be regarded as a t
necessary evil, which cannot be removed j
without eradicating some of the highest in- ]
ccntives to virtue, and substituting baser p
means of gratification to the malignant pas- a
sions of society; is it not still expedient to 6
limit within the strict bounds ofthatne-j1
cessity, by rendering tlic penalties of the |'
law scarcely less odious or endurable than | j.
the motive to violate it. That it is some- r
times the only, or most available evidence t
of a high character; or that it may possibly
be needful to risk life to preserve ho- s
nor, furnishes no reason why its worse 1
consequences should so frequently and un- 1
necessarily, bo permitted to stain the in- y
discretions of youth, and the trivial occa?
sions of ordinary life, with the blood of c
human victims. And let it be instructive- c
ly remembered that it has become in prac- i
tier, as much, and as often the cloak of r
dishonor, and the refuge of cowardice, as 1
the protection and resort of oppressed and s
persecuted met it. In its westward pro- ?
gross, the last gloamings of its chivalric
origin may even now be discerned to min- ^
?: li; in the .disgraceful lira wis ol the mur- {
derer, 1)1 c assassin and the felon. The c
dillicnity of < ll'ectually rt pressing the prac- c
lice in this S.ate, is perhaps insuperable; 1
but the omissions of our legislation, and 1
the toleration of our laws should be no J
longer justly charged with a tendency to |
encourage that morbid state of public opin- t
ion. requiring such bloody and unreasona- v
bio sacrifices to gratify an unnppeascable c
appetite lor excitement and revenge.? r
JS one salutary ehcck might at least be im- f
jtosed by the example ol our public func- j
tionaries, to the too frcquenf and reckless r
abuse of this practice. It would perhaps t
he safely advancing one stop toward the t
reformation of public opinion, if every t
public functionary in the Slate were re- c
strained from participating in it by the con- F
.iition of bis olfiee. It is but just, that while 1
enjoying the confidence and liberality of c
the State, they should be required to comply
with the obligations imposed by their t
elevated positions; to present high exam- a
pies of conduct, of principle, and of mor* e
alily; an ermine unstained by crime, and s
hands unsullied by blood. a
Among other causes of moral improvement,
we cannot but contemplate with great satisfac- r
tion, the rapid and extensive progress of the j.
Temperance Ilcforni, in operating on the habits, j;
the health, and the happiness of our people.? ^
No moral reformation can he conceived to be J.
more important or beneficial in its influence on n
society, or promises a greater harvest on those
pou'-ei'ul virtues and mora! blessings, by which ?
tin harmony ami the prosperity of a community ^
are 0 efVvrilly ami benignly nrosnoted. From .
* ^ ' . . il
its i!:fl >?:i tiic halms, we may justly anti-l^
cipve '!ir* 'si c libels oil the passions and r
the vice ' i. and by abstracting the strong- t
est. incentives oi crime, it may reasonably be sup- (|
posed to strengthen the moral sanctions of tlie t
law, and perhaps in time, to supersede the noccssity
of many of its penal restrictions. It has ?
evoked a salutary spirit of change from the licen- ^
tiousness and the phrenzy of inflamed passions,
and maddening excitements, to that state of dispassionate
reason, and considerate reflection, so
eminently condusive to the enjoyment of a vir- jj
tuous and peaceful life. And were it proper to
look beyond these general considerations, for |
motive to legislation, in the ordinary details of
private life, they might be amply deduced from
the increased amount of individual health and p
happiness, and in the harmonious relations of the ^
domestic circle, of which it has been so benefi- t(
cially promotive.
J3ut while indulging in the gratifying contem- _
plafion of its eminent success and influences, ?
hitherto attained without legislative inducements Q
or restrictions, it is well to reflect, whether any
legal provisions, however judicious, and well in- |
tended on your part, might retard, rather than
facilitate that progress, which other and moral
causes, have contributed so much to advance.?- .
Legal interference, to enforce obligations of mo-! .
rality, is hut too apt to be r- gardcu by the people f1
with jealousy and distrust, and often begets a !'
disposition to evade and violate those salutary
restraints, which a sense of their own interests "
might otherwise induce them voluntarily to as- s
sumo, and sacredly to respect The authority of V
i lie law, would be .is inadequate to enforce moral V
habits, as it has been found by experience, una- (
vailing to inculcate religious tenets. They must
be left to the voluntary impulse of the heart, and ."
the moving inspiration of their divine origin.? !'
Human institutions borrow strength and lustre
from the sanctions of a pure and high morality, s'
but they cannot reciprocate the support they reccive.
Our enactments may punish crimes, but 11
cannot correct vices; they may reform conduct, P'
hut cannot reach the heart, the motives, or the ai
habits of men; for they can neither impart great- c<
er terrors, or add stronger inducements, to the ?
rr.l rll.nl ir?nc nr rournivls of an alarillfir] nr nn on
lightened conscience. het us leave it then, in e
the hands in which it has so much prospered-? 11
to the influence of an enlightened public opinion;
to the dictates of a sound philosophy?to the t'
suggestions of reason, and the restraints of ino- i'
rdity?to tiie irresistible appeals of wise pre- "
cejits and virtuous examples?to the interested a
motives of me- to seel; the means of happiness c
and health; and above all, to the rebuking terrors tl
and consequences of a debauched and predicate
life. ti
The posVionofan alliance which this State has a
assumed, in defending the institutions of the S
south, against the aggressive legislation of New a
York, is one of a character loo important and in- n
tCiesting to be overlooked, in the deliberations of J
the present session. The wise and accessary in- n
snectiou law?instituted by Virginia, to regulate f
ler commercial relations with that State, and t
adopted with great propriety, and I trust, saluta- o
y effect, in this?has been executed, so far as it
las been in my power to enforce it, with the tl
no6t exact and rigid adherence to its provisions c
ind requirements. This measure, mild, temper- f<
ite and defensive as it is?the least that an in- c
ured State, or an aggrieved people, could resort h
o, to protect the rights and property of the citi- ti
;en?forbearing and constitutional as it must be a
idmitted by all states and nations to be?has, I p
egret to say, not been responded to, by the repeal s
f those obnoxious measures against the soutlu tl
ipon tl--evidence of which, I should have been a
llltfinrtTCkrl tr? cnnotirl ito nnoratinn t<
Vet it has not, I trust, been altogether without ?
ts effect upon the counsels, or its moral influx tl
nice upon the justice and magnanimity* of the d
^lightened people of New York. The princi- v
ties of democracy, about to be in the ascendant tl
u her counsels, will unquestionably repudiate "
he injustice of enacting aggressive laws to vio- fi
ate the rights and institutions of a sister State, h
The late decisions of the Federal Judiciary too a
ilainly prohibit and discountenance such daring v
nd wanton outrages upon the guarantied and a
overeign rights of an independent member of the p
:onfederacy. The confidence of her people has al- o
eady been shriven of the influence of the.actors i
tnd instigators of that unwise and illiberal pro-1 s
eediug; and the official aggressors themselves, j v
ebuedk, dishonored, and distrusted, are about to ' t
ie consigned to a merited retributive obscurity, j n
No other legislative action is perhaps neces- j t
ary at this time, but to re-enact the provision of c
aw, leaving it discretionary with the Executive , d
o suspend its operation, in the event of those fa- j t
'orable contingencies arising, which would reti-, g
ler it expedient to exercise it. j f
Many gratifying, though not official, assuran- I c
:es, induce us to hope for a speedy renewal of t
?ur amicable relations with a sister state, whose c
mportance as one of the largest and most com- j 1
nercial members the confederacy, as well as \ s
he sound democratic principles and enterprising ! r
pirit of her people, and above all, the friendly as- e
ociations hitherto subsisting between us, render c
t in every respect desirable. s
The recent accumulaling results of the geological
researches instituted by the enlightened c
mterprise of almost every 6tate and people, in- a
luce me again to appeal to your patriotic consid- s
iration to encourage and promote its useful inves- f
igations in our own. The resources of our cli- I
nate, the unexplored treasures of our soil, the r
icculiar value and character of our staples, all
:onspire to impel us onward in a laudable emu- t
ation of the success of other examples to improve c
hose great and permanent means of national a
vealth and prosperity, in other countries agri- u
ultural pursuits constitute but a portion of their
esources?often secondary to commerce, to ma- ti
lufactures, and the prosecution of the useful arts, t
II fnrnislimir menna nf wealth or susbsistoncc. t
Jut with us, it is t lie great, the universal, and al n
nost the only enduring element of individual ti
>r national prosperity. Even our domestic insti- b
utions are of a character so immutably agricul- r
ural, as to vibrate with all its reverses and vi- c
:is9itudes. They would perish, or depart, in t
iroportion as the profits of this great branch of ti
ndustry were neglected to seek more hospitable c
dimes, more profitable investments, or a more li
mterprising people. To these impelling motives ti
if necessity, to encourage the improvements of b
his great source of wealth and revenue, we may ti
da the attractive inducements which an enlight- ti
ned sense of our interest presents, to institute d
cientific researches into those hidden treasures
nd undeveloped energies of the soil, which a r
artial experience has discovered it most amply o
o produce. The aphorism of the great philoso- f:
ihcr. <4that he who causes two blades of grass to b
tow, where only one grew before, confers the b
reatest benefit on society," may be literally ap- ti
licable to the improvement of our agricultural I
ondition: because our staples, and our products b
iot only substitute, but far exceed the value and d
rofits of these primitive objects of husbandry.? d
Jut he who stimulates and enlightens the labors, o
y which the millions of other countries as well d
s our own, are employed, clothed and subsisted; *
e who, by adding to the profits of ourj agricuitu- h
al industry, arrests the rolling tide of emigra- e
ion; he who by increasing the 'supplies and comnrts
of the homestead, strengthens and fosters s
hose local attachments, which are the true, and y
icrhaps the only foundation of an ardent, and o
ermanent patriotism will certainly achieve more p
0 advance the wolfure of the state than all the w
peculations of all the politicians have ever ac- ai
omplished. ai
The increased ratio of representation estab- m
ished by the late act of Congress, will demand S
our attention, to organize our Congressional ti
)istrict6, so as to conform to the diminished V
umber of Representatives to which this State to
ill be entitled. T*hat itwilipresenttoourcon- pi
ideration a question of 6onie practical difHcul- v<
es and embarrassmenrs, is perhaps reasonably m
1 be expected. But I trust it will bo productive ct
f no other feelings, than those arising out of a ai

ions of that act, are sufficient to reconcile us to jc

n diminishing the number, it must increase the ot
idividtlal responsibilities of members, and per- rc
aps their wisdom and qualifications, by extend- pi
ig the opportunities of a selection to their con- n;
tituents. And while we may reasonably pre- or
nine that the influence of electioneering expe- tli
ients will be proportionably lessened, as it is si
iffused over a greater surface, and through a di
reater number, we may justly hope, that the p:
leasure will add to the federative strength and ei
nportancc of the States, by-securing greater ai
armony and unanimity in the views and coun- lii
els of their several delegations. If it in any h?

Tlie legal proceedings which have been insti- M
liter! by the direction of the Legislature, against V
portion of the Banking Institutions of the 5
!tate, refusing to accept the provision of "An
ct to "prevent the suspension of specie pay- B
newts," being still"pending ;tlie decision of the tli
udiciary, it would perhaps be improper and un- hi
lecessary to anticipate a resort to the more ef- tB
ective expedients and appliances of legislation, fa
o correct evils which the ordinary jurisprudence
f the State way prove adequate to remedy.
In the mean time, the judicial reference of
hat question ought not to be permitted tosuperede
the dutv of instituting other regulations
3r the improvement and stability of our State
urrency. The experience of the last few years
as proved, that bank investments are dispropoionably
large to the requirements of commerce,
nd the exigencies of the community?that their
rofits and business have diminished, as the
wollentideof speculation has subsided within
be ordinary limits of a judicious economy?that
very moderate, and scarcely a reasonable inerest
has succeeded to the enormous profits that
/ere formerly so magically realized?and that
be inflated prices of bank stock have rapidly
eclined, to an extent as much below, as they
/ere formally above, their original value. In
bis suddeh dearth and abstraction of the ordiary
modes and stimulants of business and prots,
it is not surprising, that the banks should
ave resorted to expedients, bordering on usury
nd extortion, and clearly not contemplated
/ithin the legitimate province of banking opertions.
Among these, are the extensive, and
ierhaps I may add, almost exclusive and monoplizing
operations which they have conducted
n domestic exchange. Of all the deranging and
inister influences upon credit and currency, this
vhen carried to the extent of absorbing the cntre
business of bank capital, is perhaps the
nost fatal and vitiating. It presents the temptuion
to create, and to perpetuate, that very state
if inequality in the circulation, from which it
lerives its greaicst emoluments. It compels
he borrower to receive from, and meet his engagements
with the banks, in currencies of diferent
and unequal value. It supercedes a sound
:irculation, with depreciated paper; traffics in
he distresses and exigences of the people; and
:onvcrts banking capital into a system of brokerage
and extortion, exacting from the nccesities,
rather than accommodating commercial
equirements, of the community. It subjects
interprise and credif, to the disastrous influen-|
es of sudden and unnecessary contractions, for!
elfish and sinister purposes.
That it is a practice that has obtained to a
onsiderable, although I trust not to so iinmor.1
an extent in the business and operations of
omc of our own institut ons, may be inferred
rorn the great disproportion which exists bewecn
their profits and circulation: Nor is it uneasonable
to presume that from this cause chiefy,
the monetary pressure and (difficulties of
lie present year, (on the commercial class of our
itizens especially,) have been unnecessarily
ggravated, and have derived their greatest and
aost unmitigated severity.
Under ordinary circumstances, a small capiil,
with a liberal circulation, is usually producive
of the most profitable results, as well a?
he easiest and most prosperous condition of the
aonetary affairs of a community. Dut the pracice
referred to has reversed this natural relation
etween bank capital and its uses. Our Jcxpcience
presents the fiscal anomaly, of a large
apital with a stinted circulation. Upwards of
welve millions of bank stock, realizing an in-:
erest of more than six per cent. 011 the whole
apital, with a circulation not exceeding a tuilion
and a half, for the relief and accornmodaion
of the people! From this view, it would
e necessarily seen, that the profits of the sysem
are now chiefly derived from other sources
han those which legitimately flow from the orinary
business of banking.
In these remarks, however, justice perhaps
cquircs that 1 should state, that the conformity
f most of our minor institutions to a policy so'
ital to the monetary interest of the State, is I
elieved to be in a great measure constrained,:
y the autocratic inJiucnce, as well as the scducive
example, of our larger monied corporations,
le this as it may, the almost entire diversion of
anking operations into new channels, the suden
abstraction of the customary bank accommoations
from a community hitherto Hushed and
ver stimulated with the facilities of a rcdunant
circulation, would of itself produce, as
r-ell as aggravate, much of that distress, which
as been so severely and desolatingly experienced,
in our State.
The corrective of these evils, and the responibility
of applying or neglecting it, rests with
ou. How far a prohibition to each bank to pay
ut any but its own notes exclusively, would imosc
a salutary restraint upon the practices to
'hich I have alluded, I submit to your wisdom
nd experience to determine. It is suggested
3 the most moderate and equitable of those
leasures within the competency of a sovereign
tate to institute, in enforcing salutary rcgulaons
to establish a sound and stable currency.?
Whether it should apply to all, or exclusively
i those institutions which have refused to comy
with the provisions of the lute act, "to prejnt
the suspension of specie payments," is a i
atter which a proper respect for the patriotic .
^nfnrmitv nf ?nrnp r?t* irictitnfinnc in tlm I
jtliority and requirements of a sovereign State,
inders worthy of consideration. If there be
tything onerous in the provisions of that act; if !
lere be power or, jealousy of rival inslitu- 1
jns; it would certainly not comport with the
isdom and equity of the Legislature, to subct
them to an inconvenient penalty for a patriic
compliance with the will of the State, and
lereby pamper and reward the contumacy of
hers, by increasing the advantages of their
icusancy. If the State has lost its power to
otect, it should at least abstain from the tyranf
of imposing partial# and invidious restrictions, '
1 its citizens and institutions. If the result of
ie present controversy shall indeed, prove that ,
ie cannot enforce her laws, let her retire with ,
gnity, from the position of asserting but a
irtial and divided supremacy; and in such an
ient, exefcisc the magnanimity of removing '
ty odious disabilities, which nothing but a wil- !
ag and patriotic obedience to ber authority, may 1
tve enabled her to impose on the most descrvig
of her institutions. ;
