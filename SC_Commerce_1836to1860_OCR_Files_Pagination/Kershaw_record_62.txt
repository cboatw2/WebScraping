696.063, the amoflnt which will be left in
the rfeposite banks, subject to the draft of 1
the Treasurer of the United States, after 1
the contemplated transfers to the several 1
States are made. If, therefore, the future !
receipts should not be sufficient to meet these 1
outstanding and future appropriations, there
inav be soon a necessity to use a portion of I
the funds dejKuited with the States. The
consequences apprehended, when the !
depositc act of the last session received a!1
reluctant approval, h&wt been measurably 11
realized. Though an act merely for the dp- j'
positc of the surplus moneys of the United'1
States in the State Treasuries, for safe keep- ; '
ing, until they may wanted for the ser-;|
rice of the General Government, it has been'
extensively spoken of as an act to give the!1
money to the several Xtatas, and they have;1
been advised to use it as a gift, without re- '
gard to the means of refunding it when call- '
cd for. Such a suggestion has doubtless!'
been made without a due consideration of, *
the obligation of thedepostte act, and with- '
out a proper attention to flic various princi- 1
p!r*s aud interests wheh arc affected by it?s1
It ts manifest that the law itself cannot sane-j<
(inn such a sugg?*5t?n, and thai, as it now j
stands, the States lure no more authority to > i
receive and use th?se deposttes without in-'<
tending to return them, than any deposite I

with the s-.fc-kcrphg or application of the I

be equally conclusive against the adoption' ]
of any measure recognising the principles |
on which the suggestion has hern made. 11

A distribution to the people Is imprac- 1
lirablc and unjust in other respects, ft 1
would be taking one man's property and 1
giving it to another. Such would be the 1
unavoidable result of a rule of equality \
[and oone other is spoken of? or would be
likely to be adopted) inasmuch as mere is '
no mode by which the amount of the in* '
lividual contribalions of our citizens to i
ibe public revenue can be ascertained.? 1
We know that they contribute unequally, 1
ind a rule therefore that would distribute 1
in thori rftttnlla. twnuld hp liahlp In all ihn '
? -J J' ? ??
objections which apply to the principle of
in equal division of property* To make <
[he General Government the instrument i
>f carrying this odious principle into ef- 1
feet, would be at once to destroy the I
roean* of its usefulness, and change the <
haracmr designed for it by the framcrs i
jf the constitution. 1 <
But the more extended and injurious '
ronsequences likely to result from a poll v
which would collect a surplus revenue *
ror the purpose of distributing it, maybe 1
forcibly illustrated by an examination of j
ihe effects already prodticed by the present J
leposite act* This set, although certainy
designed to secure the safc-kecping of J
ihe public revenue, is not entirely tree '
n its tendencies from many of the objec- J
[ions which apply to this principle of dia- j
iribution. The Government had, without '
leccsaiiy. received from the peoples large 1
turplos. which, instead of being employ 1
?d as heretofore, and returned to them by 1
Tirsns of the publie expenditure, was de 1
posited with sundry banks. The banks 1
in malm l?,ni ttnun ihi? ?nr. I
? plus,
and thus converted it into banking 1
rapitals. and in manner it has tended to '
multiply bank charters, and has had a great 1
tgcnry in producing a spirit of wild spe- '
:uhtion. The possession and use of the 1
property out of which this surplus was 4
created. belong to the people, but the Go 4
rcrnmcnt has transferred its possession to !
incorporated banks, whose interest and 1
effort it is to make large profits out of its 1
use. This process need ouly be stated to 1
sh w i?s injustice and bad policy. 1
And the same observations apply to the i
influence which is produced by the steps 1
necessary to collect, ss well as to distii- 1
bote such a revenue* About three fifths '
nf all the duties on imporkt are paid in the I
city of New York, but it is obrious that 1
ihc means to pay those duties are drawn 4
from every quarter of the Union. Every 4
citizen in every State, who purchases and '
consumes an article which has paid a duty '
at that port, con tributes to the aecumnla !
The surplus collected there 1
must, therefore, be made up of moneys 1
or property withdrawn from other points 4
anil other States. Thus the wealth and 1
business of every region from which 1
these surplus lunds proceed, must be to 4
same extent injured, while that of the *
place where the funds are concentrated,
and are employed in banking, are propor- |
lionabl) extended. Out both in making
the transfer of the funds which are firat
necessary to pay the duties and collect
the surnlus?and in makincr the re-trans
fcr, which becomes necessary when the 1
lime arrives for the distribution of that '
surplus?there is a considerable period I
when the funds cannot be brought int<* 1
uS?, and it is manifest that, besides tl.t *
loss inevitable from such an operation, its
tendency is to produce fluctuations in 1
the business of the country, which arc 1
always productive of speculation, and 1
detrimental to the interests of regular I
trade. Argument can scarcely be uecei> 1
sary to snow that a mrasurr of this '
character ought not to receive further 1
legislative encouragement. 1
By examining the practical operation <
of the ratio for destribution, adopted in 1
the deposite bill of the last session, wc
shall discover other features, that appear
equally objectionable. Let it be asau*
mod, for the sake of argument, that the
surplus moneys to be deposited with the
fSstrs nave Dern collected, anu oeiong 10
ihrni, in the ratio of lite federal representative
population?-an assumption f<>undrd
upon the fart that any deficiencies in
our future revenue from imposts and
public lands, must be made up by direct
taxes, collected from the States in that
ratio. It ia proposed to diatributc the
suaplus, say $30,000,000, not according
to the ratio in which it has been collected
and belongs to the people of the Slates,
but in that of their votes in the colleges i
nffelrrtors of Pressdrnt and Vice Pre si- i
<lcnt. The effect of a distribution upon <
that ratio in shown by the annexed table, i
marked A. 1
By an examination of that table, it trill
be perceived that in the distribution of a
surplus of $30,000,000, upon that basis,
there is a great departure from the princi*
pie which regards representation as the
true measure of raxation; and it will
found that the tendency of-ihoi ^par*^
lore will be to increase whatever inequalilie*
bare been supposed to atufad the ,t.
operation of oor federal system in it*
spect to its bearings upon the different ^
interests of the Union. In making the
basis of representation the basis of taxation,
the farmers of the constitntson intended
to equalize the burdens which am
necessary to support the Gorernment;
-J?*-? -1 ?Lll. ?o
uu uic auujuiun m mm ruuu, wunc ??
accomplished this object, was also tho
means of adjusting other great topics
arising ont of the conflicting views reipeeting
the political equality of the various
members of tho confederacy.?
Whale rer therefore disturbs the liberal
spirit of the corqpromites which established
a rule of taxation so just and
squiiable, and which experience has'
proved to be so well adapted to the genius
?nd hsbilf of our people, should be rereived
with the greatest caution and distrust.
A bare inspection, of the annexed table
?f the differences produced by the ratio
asnd in the deposite act, compared with
the results of a distribution according to
be rauo of direct taxation, most satisfy
:rery unprejudiced mind, that the former
ratio contravenes the spirit of the
ronstilution, end prodcces a degree of
njustiec in the operation of the F-dera!
jorerntntni which would be fatal to the
tope of perpetuating iu By the ratio of
lireel taxation. for example, the State of
Delewan*. in the r llection of $30,000.M)0,
of revenue, would pay into the
rrcssury $199,716: und in the diatribu*
ion of $30,000,000. she would rcceir*
>ack from the (internment, according to
he ratio of the deposite bill, the cum of
1306,122: and similar results would fofow
the comparison between the small and
he large State* throughout the Union:
hus realizing to toe small States an adranlage
wrhi h would ba doubtless as uu
icccpubJe to them as a motive for incorpo-sting
the principle in any system which
>roducc it, as it would be inconsistent
villi the rights aud expectations of the
arge States. It was certainly the intenion
of that provision of the constitution
vhich declares that all duties, imposts
ind excise" shall ' be uniform throughmi
the United States,** to make the burlens
of taxation tail equally upon the
pcopla in whatever JSutc of the Union
they may reside. Dm u hat would be the
ralnc of such an uniform rule if the moDies
raised by it coald be immediately
returned by a different one which will
give to the people of some States ouch
more, and to those of others much loss,
than their tatr proportions? Wir?- the
federal Government to exempt, in express
terms, the imports, and manufanu
res of some portions of country from all
Juties, while it imposed heavy ones oo
others, the injustice could not be greater.
It would be easy to show how, by the
operation of such a prineiple, the large
Slates of the Union would not only have
lo contribute their just share towards iht
rapport of the Federal Government, but
slso lure to besr in some degree the
taxes necessary to support the Govern
men is of their smaller sisters; but it is
deemed unneccslary to slate the details
where the general principle is so obvious.
A system liable to such objections can
never be supposed to have been sanctioned
by the framers of the constitution, when
they conferred on Congress the taxing
power: and I feel persuaded that a mature
riaminstinn of the ?uKirrt trill us tie.
fy every one that there are insurmountable
difficulties in the operation of any
plan which can be devised of collecting
revenue for the purpose o( distributing it.
[*o* r#"?a ia . itlv authorizm .. levy uses

won defence and general wet/art of the Vn*?
led StatesThere ia no such provision
u would authorize Congress to collect toKilher
the property of the country under
e name of revenue, for the purpose of
dividing it equally or unequally an ong
the States or the people* Indeed, it is
not probable that such an idea ever occurred
to the Slates when they adopted
the constitution. But, however this may
be. the only safe rule for us in interpreting
the nnanrt <rrant**d I t (hp Fpilrral Go
vcrninent, is to regard the absence of express
authority to touch a subject so important
and delicate as this is, as equivalent
