ON MAKING GOOD BACON. i
The bcgiuing of a year it generally the (
time for Putting op Pork for Bacon;* as I
this a standing dish in the West, I have
concluded to give yon the result of thirty
year's experience upon this important
subject. The first thing necessary to
ffiake good Bacon is to have fat hogs?
slaughter them in the beginning of the
"3" take care of the
WeeK, so mai ___
offal before Saturday night; otherwise, [
if a warm day or two should intervene,
port of it may be lost. It is highly important
that hogs, slaughtered for bacon,
should be well bled?the more complete-'
fy the vessels are emptied of blood, the i
less disposition there is in meat to taint, j
or putrify. As soon as'the hog is well [
cleaned snd hung up, it should be freely !
washed with warm water, wiped with a
towel, and carefully scraped with a sharp
? it.. ?i.- mrs and feet, if
Knue especially mv ???.??.
you wish to have good souee or hogs-1
head-cheese. These parts are generally
neglected, and thrown by " for a more
convenient season, and then taken up
by the cook or some idle chap about
the establishment, and then hair signed
off, and the skin burned until it be- {
comes black and bitter; thereby impart-M
ing its color nnd taste to the souse and <
hogs-head-cheese. After gutting the hog 1
the inside should be carefully and freely 1
washed with cold water, with the mouth I
open, so the whole may pass through the jJ
throat and remain in this condition until if
completely cool, which will generally,!'
lake place, even in moderate weather, in!1
one night. If the weather should be so I
mild that it will not cool in or.c night, it 11
had better be cut up and spread upon]'
bVick and stone pavements previously wet /1
with cold water; if the meat is still soft a
dash cold water upon it and it will soon ?
*' L -1 '? "II OO0OC Ills

should be perfectly cool if practicable. In "
one or two instances, I have made as
good bacon as I have ever made out of
meat frozen so hard that it had to be cut
up entirely with an axe. As to the
mode of salting and the quantity of salt j
necessary to cure pork, so as to make
good bacon, every man thinks tint he i
knows better than his neighbor. I have '
experimented for the purpose of ascer-i
taining the best mode of salting down
pork, as also the proper quantity of salt
and other ingredients, such as sugar, molasses,
red pepper and saltpetre, all of
which have their advocates, nnd have
settled down and pursued the following
practice for the last twenty years, (Measure
a bushel of salt?spread it upon a
table, weigh a pound of saltpetre--pulverize
it carefully and mix it thoroughly with j
the salt. This mixture is sufficient for a!
thousand weight of small meat, or eightj
hundred of large, to be well rubbed upon
every piece, and more especially upon
the fleshy surface, and taking care to pack
your joints at the bottom and rill up the
little interstices wiihjowles, chine and
rounds?the latter piece is made by cut-! e
tiiig the neck off at the sholder and ia
jou les. The length of time necessary to ^
keep pork in salt to make bacon, depends !'
upon the weather and the size of the meatIf
the weather is mild and the meat small! c
4 weeks will belong enough; but if the i ^
- - .. fh
weather is cold and the meai jargv, u j
should remain in salt from six to eight!8
weeks, and should be taken up at the end [u
of four weeks and well rubbed and sprink-!8
led with salt, in case the first has i
dissolved. It is then to be hung up in a j.n
dark smoke house, and the darker the bet- J
ter, for the purpose of excluding flies? "
you will never find flies in a room where
the light is completely shut out. The l:
higher your stnokc house the better, sp
that yon may hang your m*at out of the n
influence of the heat?every joint and ?!
jowls should be hung by the thick end, and i J
every middling bv the thick edge, or thai
part of the middling which was cut from ei
the back bone; this I know to be a mat- sf
ter of the first consideration in making 81
good bacon by attending strictly to this
rule, you will retain all the juices of the
meat, as well as the salt that has been absorbed?or
in other words your meat will P
not drip; whereas, if you reverse the position
and hang it by the small end, it c
will drip, become dry, and hard, and *
loose in weight; and what I conceive to 0
he of some importance, its fine flavor.? j n
Some who make good bacon, say that it|?
is important to smoke your meat with}0
some particular kind of wood, but I tma- s
gine the only secret about this matter, is c
the bitterness imparled lo the meat, there- 1
l>y rendering the taste unpleasant to the j 8
Ay, and keeping up a continual smoke.1
ton create an atmosphere that the fly can-; F
not live in?viewing the matter thus, we ! a
have every day or two thrown a few pods > ^
of red pepper upon the smoke wood?I1
atmosphere very unfit for the respiration e
of man and I apprehend equally so for
the fly- Our meat continued suspended ^
in the smoke house during the year, is a
slightly smoked every morning and plen- 5
tifullv smoked every damp dav. If your 1
readers will observe ihese rules, I will jc
almost- venture to insure such bacon asfa
would make anv epicure smack his chops. ?6

item of great interest?especially tc

his item is by no means as large as might
a expected from the long and multiplied
nbariassments of the country, but it is
ill large enough to pozzle both the banks

From the New York Herald, November 25.
The prospect of a resumption on the
art of the Philadelphia banks is becomig
daily less probable?the rnerchantile
immunity, both here and at the eastrtrd,
have no confidence in the stabillity
f the resumption, brought about by the
leans proposed. All that the merchant
f this city want is a steady currency, oi
ne, the position ol which they under
land and can provide against its contin'
ies. The resumption will indeed mak<
he currency uniform, but merchants havt
Iready been twice deceived in the Nor
hern banks. Twice they have sold im<
lorted goods and manufactures to a largt
mount in the South and Southwest, ta>
ing notes payable in the currency o
hose sections, and running the risk of the
xchunge. in lull confidence of the sta^
lility of the banks. Twice has this con
idence been abused. If the currencj
gain becomes uniform by means of a re
umplion based upon borrowing opera
ions, it is in vain to suppose that mcr
bants will again run the risk of beii.g
gain robbed (the expression is not tot
trong,) by the incapacity of the banki
i) -maintain their position. The banks o
his city will not take the risk of Southcrr
ollections on the faith of Philadeiphk
lonrsty. If the banks do resume, the
ule for mercantile paper must be shori
laics payable in New York funds* Th(
southern insolvent banks will gain no
hing by such a state of things Thej
eein to be aware of this fact, and are al
eady laying at "anchor to windward,'
>y feeling through their organs the state
if public opinion in regard to non-rcsump
i- lidn. "With this view, the Courier of thi
n moroing opposed resumption in an arii
f cle, of which the following is an extraci
e ''If the press of the State of Pennsyl
vania is true to its interests, they will ca!
upon their hanks not to resume specie pa)
menls, as it is termed, unless they feel i
perfectly convenient so to do* The Lr
gislature-will also, if wise, repeal i(
compulsory enactments on this point, an
the people should not merely sanction, bi
loudly call for such course;nay, the Legii
lature should go still further?it shoul
authorize the banks to issue notes und<
the denomination of five dollars."
For the community at large this cours
is undoubtedly better than an uncertain r<
sumption, a continuance of suspenno
will gradually and inevitably increase tl
discredit of the insolvent banks, uni
lh?v ?rp fnr<*ort inln linnidation. At tl
same time the real business of the-emu
try will increase on the specie basis <
New York. The sales of the great st
pies will be made in the currency of Ei
gland. The imports and manufacture
must be paid for in a specie currency, an
the sound banks will inevitably absoi
the whole real trade of the country, jtr
force the irredeemable banks into liqu
r" dalion. On the other hand, if the baril
| do resume by borrowing, they will obtai
ej neither the confidence of the sound banl
" ; nor the community, and will be defeau
e l in any attempt to inflate prices by stimuli
r j ting speculation, in order to profit it i
'I j the expense of the public. A resumptic
6 j under such circumstances will only pri
' j tract the present uncertainty of affair
e and will eventuate inevitably in anotht
^ I suspension.

: this seizure is as follows: about the 25tl
I- of Oct. iast, white Commodore Moor
II wits ivtng ut a little island called Lobez,
r. severe norther came on, by which a Mexi
it can brig w as driven ashore and wrecked
-1 The Commodore sent his boats promptl
,s to their assistance, and saved the crew an
d passengers 26 in number, and a part of th
it vessel's cargo. Some conception may b
b* formed as to the violence of the gah
d when it is staled that all the anchors of th
?r Commodore's ship were barely sufficiei
to keep her from dragging, and also thi
te it took the first boat that he sent to the ri
B-ilief of the brig, well manned as shewa
>n i fr rn 9 in the morning until 5 in the ever
ie j ing to reach the wreck. The Commodoi
il j sailed for Tampico immediately and lat

A he sent one of his boats ashore for th
a- purpose of getting a supply When-th
i- boat had got within reach of the guns <
*s the fort at Tampico, it was fired upq
id three several times, the last shot strikin

it wherever it eould be found upon the big
in seas. The cargo of the wrecked vesse
). which he ha ! intended to have lande
s, that day, consisting of flour and coffee, h
:r retained as lawful spoil. It may be mei
tioned here, also, that Mr. Treat, 01
agent at Mexico, has abandoned all hop
of treating with that government, and n
turned lo Vera Cruz, on his way home,

,h parted company with the sloop of war an
: went on a cruize.--On the 2d instant in th
b, i afternoon, she came in sight of the abov

)fj United Stales as a signal, which the Ami
j Maria answered by running up Mexica
frj colors. The San Antonio then lowere
a | the United States color, and flred a gu
.to bring the Anna Maria to, at the sam
