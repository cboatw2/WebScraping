In the other Ilall of Congress, the same
line of policy characterizes each of the
contending parlies. It needs but a mere
perusal of the Journals to establish beyoud
a doubt, that every measure which has
checked the advance of Abolition owes its
chiof support and success to the friends of
the Administration?-while those propositions
which evince hostility to our Institutions,
always originate and are sustained
amongst the opposite party. The very
fact (which the Opposition arc compelled
to admit) that their Candidate for the Presidency
has declared his opinion that the
Revenues of the Federal Government can
be constitutionally and ought to be applied
to the emancipation of Slaves, is altogether
conclusive. It proves that if he be
elected President the Constitution irf no
longer the guaranty of our property?but
we hold it under that most degrading and
uncertain of all tenures?the will of a majority,
and that majority with interests
variant from, and even hostile to, oui own.
2. The next great leading measure upon
which we feel bound to make common
cause with the Administration, is its opposition
to a Bank of the United States we
take it as established beyond a doubt, that
the people of South-Carolina have made
up their final judgment against such an institution.
Tney regard it as both dangerous
and unconstitu:ijual; as abandoning all
the ground which has been gained against
implied powers; and as yielding up our
rights, political and commercial, to the unlimited
control of the section in which such
a Bank would be located. The dangers
to a Republic with which such an institution
is fraught, and its disastrous influence
over the commerce and agriculture ofihe
country, have now become matter of history,
and it can be only those who prefer
the quietude of despotism, who would now
unite the ir efforts with the Opposition party,
and propose to the South to surrender
itself at discretion to the tender mercies of
u fifty or seventy million Bank.
2. The establishment of a steady and
constitutional currency, is justly considered
one of the most important measures
which the Administration has sought to
promote. In so laudable and patriotic a
purpose, we feel bound to yield them our
entire confidence and support; and when
we consider the peculiarly untoward condition
of the times, and the array of influence.
interest and prejudice against which
they have had to contend, in advancing this
great measure, we cannot too strongly express
our approbation and encouragement.
Every efibrt has been used by a vast majority
of the partisans and debtors of nine
hundred Batiks scattered throughout the
Union, with the United States Bank at their
head, to attribute to the Administration
evils which are solely chargeable to the
speculating mania, which had over-run the
counti?: and to the over issues and errors
- J W - - - -
of the Banks themselves; but the sober, second
thought of the people is rapidly applying
the corrective; and the second suspension
of the Pennsylvania and Southern
Banks, contrasted as it is with the condition
of those in New-York and elsewhere
which have not supended, has furnished
proof of the sound views of the Administration,
and evinces to every reflecting
mind where the true mischief lies.
" There can scarcely occur any evil of
greater magnitude, than to fasten upon a
country an irredeemable paper currency.
It blights the very bu.l of enterprise, and
by subjecting to uncertainly the measure
of value, operates with as much harshness
and injustice as though standards ol value,
such as the pound weights and bushel measures
of the country, were suddenly and
capriciously to be changed. If it were
proposed to our people that the Bank Directors
or any other set of men should be
allowed to change the weights and measures
of the community, whenever it suitor!
t!inn? nln?teni>n on/I tliof /-?/> n f ? ./* r- m o rl.i
vvu iiivii I'ivusuiv.) auu i.iat cuuuuuo 'iiuui:
under tlic old standard should he execute i
accor-ing to the new, ihe pr- p..;.loi,
would deservedly meet with universal
scorn. It would be perceived at once, that
the Bank Directors or other Regulators,
could combine among themselves and
agree upon a day when the standard should
be changed, and that after that day two
pounds lor instance should be melted together
and represent but one. Of course
each man in the secret would go forth and
secure contracts for thousands of pounds
of cotton or any other article of value, to
be delivered at some period beyond the period
fixed upon for the change.
Can any thing be; more obvious, than
that when the seller is called upon f.<r -. is
contract and is thus compelled to deliver
double the quantity lie had anticipated,!
right is invaded and the most flagrant injustice
has been perpetrated? And yet pre
ciselv similar is the result which follows
the power to expand and contract the currency
of the country; a power which the
Banks now enjoy throughout the Union,
and that too without responsibility to any
but their own Stockholders. Is it not apparent,
that an irresponsible power thus
to overturn the stan laid of values, thus
to expand or contract the currency, and
thereby to enhance or put down the prices
of labor and of all commodities, is in fact
an arbitrary power over every individual?
Is it not a power to increase the rate and
expense'of ]jfe 0f every citizen, and to]
reduce at pleasure the accustomed income
of the mechanic, the laborer and the agriculturist?
It is against the irresponsible
power that the Administration has been
extending. It is to ensure steadiness and
certainty to the wages of labor, and to
the produce and commerce of the country,
that the President has so earnestly urged
- upon the people the necessity of some
check upon the Banks. Can any man]
aouDT, mat 11 me Auminisiration instead;
.
of opposing the reckless speculations of
the Western Banks had lent them its countenance
or even declined to oppose them,
that we should have now been whelmed
into a vortex of calamity, far exceeding
the worst reality we have yet encountered.
And will any man after the second suspension
of the Banks, and the present
depreciation of the bills of our nearest
neighbors; will any mau propose that the
Government should make them Depositories
of the public money, and present
them with a Bonus of from 10 to 15 per
cent, for debasing the currency of the
country? We take it as the settled policy of
South Carolina, to resist any such fallacy,
and as her determined purpose to join
with life Administration in restoring
healthful action to the body politic.
4. We regard the Opposition of the
Administration to the system of Internal
Improvement by the General Government
as furnishing another claim to our confidence
and support; and we feel ourselves
authorized to call upon the State Rights
Party of the whole South to aid them in J
ovlinirnicliinnr n svstpm sn Gprllnnnl anil I
corrupting. The people of this Stato
have declared their opinion so often upon
this subject, and are so fully satisfied of
its soundness that it would be a work of
supererogation further to discuss the subject.
5. And, lastly, we hold ourselves bound
to make common cause with the Administration,
in opposing thatprofligate parent
j of Internal Improvement, and of waste-;
ful and reckless expenditures, a TaritF for '
the protection of Dotnistic Manufactures.!
On this subject South Carolina has so recently
taken her ground in the face of
the world, that it would be vain again to
repeat her solemn declaration. All her
sons, with the exception of that fragment
which, finding no congeniality with the j
rest, has unfortunately strayed into the
camp which shelters enemies, all unite in
the great cause of Free Trade; all insist
that where the Constitution guarantees
freedom to all, none shall be restricted,
and that the Manufacturer, like every
other Citizen, should be left free to competition,
and should not fatten on the spoils
of his neighbor.
Therefore be it Resolved.
1. That the present Administration of
the General Government is entitled to our
warmest confidence and support for the
firmness and resolution with which they
have sustained the great Democratic principles
of the Constitution, and the rights
which are guarantied to the South.
2. Resolved, That the sound and. enli

by the Administration to avert the great
evils arising fiorn irredeemable Bank paper,
and to restore to the country a Constitutional
Currency, is founded upon wise
consideration of the public good, and is
entitled to our zealous encouragement and
support.
3. llesolvsd, That the uncompromising
and determined stand which has been'
made by the Administration against the
schemes of Abolitionists, evinces its sincere
and earnest regard for Southern
Rights, and entitles the President to our
confidence and support.
4. Resolved, That in identifying himself
with principles of public policy, so !
essential to the true interest of the South,
the Hon. Martin Van Buren has entitled
himself to its confidence and support, and
ns citizens of the South Carolina, we
pledge ourselves to sustain his re-election
as President of the United States.
5. Resolved, That the Hon. John C.
Calhoun, our Senator in Congress, is entitled
to the hearty confidence aniT support
of his fellow citizens for the ability
and zeal with which he has vindicated the

SATURDAY MORNING, MAY 16,1840.
THE MEETING.
The public meeting at the Court House, on Saturday
last, the proceedings of which we give today,
waa more numerously attended, than any
political meeting in this District since the memorablo
excitement in 1832-3. Tl$e object of the meeting,
as will bo seen by reference to the preamble
and resolutions, was to nominate a Candidate for
Govomor, ami never perhaps was there so much
unanimity among an assemblage so large, and composed
of men, who but a few yean since, Btood so
widely asunder. This was, in this District, the first
occasion, since the settlement in the legislator*, in
1834, of the tost oath question, that a public meeting
of all parlies has been convened in the District,
on a political question, and the result has been of
the most gratifying character. The most ample
proofs were exhibited of the fact, which we have
frequently assorted in this paper, that our old party'
feuds were buried and forgotten, and we trust that
the response which the proceedings of this meeting
will receive in every District, will prove that the
samo happy reconciliation has taken place throughout
our whole State.
The nomination of the Hon. J. P. Richardson
was warmly and zealously supported by the meeting,
and we have heard among our citizons, uo dissent to
its proccoedings. .. - -
Col. Richardson has liigh claims to the support of
the people of South Carolina. To say nothing of
his various and valued public services in the stations
to which he has been called, his aid in the Legislature
of 1834 alone, when peace was given 'to the
State, by the adoption of the celebrated Report ff
the Committoo on Federal Relations, demands our
gratitude. Who that loves order and harmony, can
call to mind the dark and gloomy cloud that hung
over us then, without fear and trembling; and no
man in the Stats, ofs any party, we verily believe,
took a more active or zealous part, or was more influential
in bringing about the adoption of ihat report,
which dispersed those clouds, and gave to the
State the light of peace.
The election of Col. Richardson, would afford
the strongest proof, (of what we should regret to
doubt,) that the reconciliation of parties, was tho.
rough throughout tho whole State. No election of
importanoe has occurred since the period to which
no leiwt KJ Ml LUU omveuijr UI inc dominant port/,
1 a sincerity which wc novcr for a moment doubted,
and we expect in December next, to find ourselves
amply justified in the eonfidcnco we have entertained.
THE MEETING IN CHARLESTON.
We have heard of no event recently, that has afforded
us more gratification, than the proceedings of
the great State Rights and Democratic meeting in
Charleston, the address and resolutions of which,
will be found in our columns to-day. We have not,
; for the last ten years, been of the opinion, that it
I was beneath the .dignity of the State to fcol, and
| to minifost, some interest in tho affairi of tho General
Government.
Wo havo always been among thoso to _ whom tho
I address refers, wTieri * speaking of tho. * prominent
Candidates for Presidency," it says, "one of them
had avowed a preference for the principles of the
South, and thereby, had secured tho favor of some
of our people." The present Chief Magistrate 1ias
most ably and firmly maintained the principles avowed
in his inaugural address, and.deserves, for his
stern and unflinching integrity, while passing through
an ordeal, well calculated to shake the consistency
of most men, that warm and cordial support which
the proceedings of this meeting promise, and which
we feel assured will meet a hearty response in the
bosoms of an overwhelming majority of the people
of South Carolina.

THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION.
This body, which assembled at Baltimore, on the
4th instant, after nominating the present Chief Magistrate,
Martin Van Buren, for rc-eloction, adjourn.,
ed, without making any nomination for the Vice j
Presidency, refcring the question back to the poo-.
pie for their determination. Under this state of |
things, it is hardly probable that any one will receive
a majority of the electoral votes, and the election
will, it is likely, bare to be mado by the So-'
nate. ,
The Hon. JonN Forstth. who had been nomi
nated for this office in Georgia, by the Union party,
Bincc the adjournment of the Convention, ban pub.
lished a communication in the Olobe, from which we
moke the following extract.
"Without denying to the Union party in Georgia,
or to any other portion of my fellow-citizens, the
right to use my name, if, in their opinion, it will
be beneficial to the public, it ^ill not bo further
mixed up in this contest if my wishes ore respected.
Whilo the contest continues, it would be a source of
vexation to mc, and what would be considered a sue- i
ccssful result, if attainable, would afford mo no per.
sonal gratification.
It willjre scon from this, that he does not iuirt I
that his name should bo used in the contest. <

Oar city is alive with "young Whigs"
from the Baltimore Convention. Some
thousands of them c-me down yesterday,
and were received at the City Hall by the
Whig Committee of the District and a
large concourse of citizens. They brought
with them their banners, badges, medals,
and miniature "log cabins," which are
carried as standards. They were addressed
by a number of members of Congress,

Hall. The actual number of members of thin
convention at Baltimore, was over twenty
thousand. It will fill the coffers of
| landlords and rail road companies, if it
; does no. other good. As to its political
I effect, it may not be so favorable to the
| Harrison cause as is expected. Had
; Messrs. Webster and Clay been kept
i out of view, instead of being placed at
J the head of the whole business, more beI
uefit would result from it to General Harrison.
Every thing that identifies the
: Harrison party with the old and often defeated
Clay and We*.ster part/, will
, help the present administration. There is
to be a great meeting of the "Whigs, in
! front of the City Hall, this morning, and
many speeches will be delivered. The
members of the Convention, taking them
altogether, are a fine looking body of
young men, of gentlemanly aspect and
bearing, and filled with enthusiasm.
The Whigs claim every State in the
Union, except New Hampshire, Mississip,
Alabama, Sootb-Caroliua, and Missouri.
Every other State, they are actually offering
to bet on. Of Virginia aiid Pennsylvania,
they seem to be as confident as of
New York. In New York, they claim a
majority of forty thousand; but I presume
they would compromise for less. Whether
all this ardor will last till the election,
remains to be seen. It may 6crre to
awaken and unite the democratic party,
and make a close contest yet. We know
that there is such a thing as a cnrrent of
public opinion, and these at ouce set in
motion, it is irresistable. Mr. Van Bitren
himself remarked, after hearing of
tho Harrisburg nomination, that Gen.
Harrison would either be elected by acclamation,
or obtain no vote at all/ This
shows that he understands the people.?
It is not pretended that he has deserted

hare all of a sudden changed their own
principles. When the supporters of Harrison,
are asked?"are you prepared for
another high Tariff, for another expansion
of paper currency, for another national
bank, for a renewal of the abolition excitement
in Congress?" The reply is "giro
us the President, and we will settle those
matters afterwards."
The National Democratic convention
