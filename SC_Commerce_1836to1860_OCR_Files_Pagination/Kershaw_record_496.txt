THE PRESIDENT'S HEALTH.
The Washington correspondent of tho Cha'rlesto:
Courier under date of the 1st inst. says: "The Prcsi
dont is most dangerously ill He was attacked 01
Saturday, the 27th ultimo, with peripneumonia, \
common and very fatal disorder in this vicinity. H
was attended, at first, by Dr. Miller, his famil;

called in. This morning, Dr. Hall and Dr. Wor

We have received the following cnmmunicalior
through the Post Office:
"Sir, you will oblige an enemy of the fair sex, bj
giving the following an insertion in your paper."?
(Here follow seven verses of four lines each, signed
Jonathan Slapjack, apparently from tho author ol
tho lines which appeared some weeks since, com.
mencing "Rose of Cumden.")
Now, what could have induced this writer to suppose
that we should pay the postage of his letter pure,
ly for tho sake of obliging an enemy of the fair
sex, wo cannot imagine. We can assure him that
he has missed the figure this time, for upon no consideration
could we be induced to commit so ungal.
lant an act.
We aro not surprised that the lady has "hiss'd" at
his love, as he very poetically expresses it, for we
think his signature alone, quito a sufficient reason
for producmg such a result. He accuses the "proud
damo" of having "trepan'd" his heart, but concludes
by a "loud" defiance, that she "can shake" his
"heart no more?for it's now free."
Reforo ho makes another attempt "to charm" a
lady's "ear,"
"By tolling love's fair pleasing tale,"
n.-mi 1,1 ndvisn him to nnnlv to tho Legislature for
a more euphonious cognomen. And also, though
last, not least, whenever ho wishes to enlist an cdi.
tor's services in his love affairs, to pay the tostace.
Jacob De La Motta has been appointed by the
President, Receiver of Public Money at Charleston,
in place of Dr. Joscm Johxso.v, resigned.
Santee Canal.?Wo observe bj* an advertisement
cf the Superintendent, that the injuries done by
the recent freshet" to the Canal, liavo all been repaired,
and that it was opened for the passage of
Boats on Saturday last.
Blood-Houxds.?Our readers cannot have forgotten
to what abuse the Administration of Mr. Van
Buren was subjected by the Whig party, on account
of the importation of Blood-hounds into Florida.?
As an evidence of the consistency of that party,
and as a commentary upon their excessive humanity,
wc perceive that Gen. Call, who imported these
vory Blood-hounds, has been appointed by General
Harrisox, Governor of Florida. '-Oh! consistency,
thou art a jewel!"
Why did the Banks in North Carolina suspend
spccio payments? Can any of our friends in that
State solve this question? The Editor of the Ob.
server, at Faycttcvillc, says, "tnat an excessive is.
sue of notes is among the last reasons which can be
properly assigned for the suspension in this State."
He goes on to say also, that "our Banks did not sus.
pend for want of specie." Well, if they had not
issued too much paper, and if it was not for want oi
specie, we should be pleased to learn what could
have created the necessity. Wo can conceive nr
other reasons which would render such a course nc
ccssary.

Indian Emigration.?The Steamer J
James Adams, in the Government service, I
i arrived at this port on Monday afternoon, e
having on board one hundred and five In
dians, emigrating to Arkansas. Major .
Bellnap, who has been charged with the
I duty cf transporting these Indians to their I
fi new home, was on board, accompanied by E
. Lieut. Sprague, Mr. Capers, Disbursing
Airent, Dr. Randall, and Mr. Cloud of the E
, Paymaster's Department. E
The party of Indians on board the E
Adams was marie up of fragments of riif E
ferent tribes, Tallahassees, Micknsukies, C
Scminoles, 6cc. Among them were thirty C
warriors, the remainder were women and C
children. The Spanish Indians captured F
by Col. Harney, were also on board. F
From a conversation had with the ofli- F
cer, we learned that a Brig had sailed from I]
Tampa, having on board one hundred and
ten, embracing Echo Emathla, the Chief Ir
of the Tallahassee?, with ninety of his L
people, and also that one hnndrcd and L
fifty were in with Gen. Armistead at the L
time the Adams depnrted. The aspect of o
affairs in the East is favorable to a close
of the war. Wild Cat had gone in to jyj
Col. Worth, at Fort Cnmmings, also, Cos- s
n-tus-ta-nug-gee, one of the most war-like c
chiefs, who promised to go out and bring ^
in all of his party.
The Tallahassers were all in except f
Tiger-tail, and a little party headed by
him comprising only about forty, among
whom were but eighteen warriors. Tiger C
tail had been frequently in at Tampa of late,
and said he was tired of fighting and
wanted "to be friends with the while 1

Report submitted by a Committee, to the
Stockholders of the South Carolina Manufacturing
Company, which is engaged in
" the manufacture of Iron, in Snartanbunrh

forms us, took possession of its works,
then in a very incomplete state, in November
1834. From that time to November
1835, the Stockholders paid in
$30,000; and since then they have not
l' paid in another dollar, except from the j
profits of the works. They are engaged | *
actively in making iron of all sorts, castings
and nails. They had been in opera- |
' lion, from Nov. 1834, to Jan. 1841, six
!* years and two months, and in that time, i (
'* under their energetic and skilful manager,! i
'* Mr. William Clark, they have paid, up, j
%s from the profits of the business, 870,000

The operations of the present year, we
understand, promise equally well.
Mr. Clark may be said to be the foun0.
der of new branch of industry amongst

vance, and devotion to business, joined
with very accurate knowledge of all the
operations connected with it, succeeded
beyond any other person amongst us, in
N developing sources of wealth, as valuable
^ to the public, as they have proved remul0
nerating to those associated with him.?
,f We are gratified to learn that he has lates.
ly become largely interested in the Nesbitt

tion on the Broad River, of which he has
se the management, and where his sphere of
g- operations will be greatly enlarged.
Even- one must feel pleasure in the

In peace, we can procure our supplies i
iron elsewhere, by sending our mone
abroad for them, which it is better w
should retain at home, to reward otrrow
