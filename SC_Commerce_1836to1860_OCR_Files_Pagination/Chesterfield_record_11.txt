J*0 <ie Editor of the Alabama Journal:
As many of the citizens of Alabama

anxious to be imformed of the true condition
of the country, I again write you on that

to hear from me, could induce me rfc "
The war in Tews has, for the lime being
ceased, and Texas has gained one of the'
most splendid triumphs known in'-tbe history
of modern wariare. In my Ljst letter I

possible: Thepolicy acted on was, conseqnently,
to.besiege and starve thcra out;
but, after seyentydavsM rial, that was fotind
impossible.?And, On the i.ijht' of the 5th
ihst.jit was determined to fttteropi the storm.;
Our whole force was four hundrjdand eighty
men, that of the enemy (ascertained since ,
their surreuder) tipwaids of fifteen hundred.
Oar camp being tibout a mile from ^the
town, and ofcas^ access from the Alamo,,

Consequently Attacked three of . the stone
houses, oiiteidc of the nubl:e sonar#, arid
parried them, without the loss ol a, nun.
After possessing themselves of the foi^e*.
a most incessant cannonading commenced
from the ta\\^ and Alamo, with discharge
of musketry, which contiuued for twentyfour
hours. ' Our m?h, being-protected; experienced
a losa of only two killed ao&ilevea

at a time to pass through \ln. this manner
they proceeded, .picking holes through the
various walls, as .they advanee'd, and driving
the eneinyfrom room to room, as they
proceeded.?And in this way they worked
and fought for five days, until they tiad driven
the enorOy from almost every house,
into their defences, around the church.
Up to this period, both partiesr liad boon

Gen. Uoss hoisted,a Waek flag, and attacked

there was scarce, an intermission in thp

during the night, presented one broad sheet
of flame, from the firing. Our j>arty, however,
continued to press forwifcrd, and" finally
drove them from the churpb, ?nd every
quarter, of the town?making thern retreat
precipitately to the Alamo, across the river
. .
Dating f their retreat across the river,
they hoisted A whjje flug,<ahd also oay from
