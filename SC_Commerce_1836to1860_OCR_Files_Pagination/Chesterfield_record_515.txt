On gatkebing Asparagus.?In all
the books of gardening whicli I have seen
ths direction for gathering asparagus lias
always been cut it sevoral inches below
the surface ofthe ground, as soon as the
talk has advanced a few inches above it. I
The asparagus generally brought to mark- |
et is cut in this way, the upper half being j
green and tender when cooked, the lower!
^ half white, tough and uneatable. The j
experience of many years has taught me ]
that it is far better to let the asparagus
grow to the height of ten inches, or a foot,
and then to gather it by breaking with
the fingers, as low down as it is tender
and breaks easily, which, when the
weather has been warm, is generally from
six to ten inches. Asparagus, thus gathered,
will be found to be much finer, the ;
whole being tender and eatable, the pro- !
duce much greater, arid the process at- J
tended with no disadvantage whatever, j
Apa agus even two feet high, will be found
fit to gather in this manner, if at any
time it has outgrown the consumption, or
escaped attention, which indeed was the
occasion on which this new method of
gathering occured to me. I have since
always practised it Let those who;
are fond of asparagus give it Dut one inai,
and tbey will never again resort to the
old system. " 0.

HoxTicuLTuirAL Asparagus.?The Anerican
apAtf or bug. of late years has
proved very destructive to wall fruij, and
particular to our finest winter apple, the
Ribston pippin. Mr. APHardy, gardener
of Jno. Grant, Esq., of Kilgraston, having
observed during the progress of this in*ect
over the garden under his charge,
the jargonelle pear uniformly escaped the
infection, it occured to him that by en- !
grafting the Ribston upon the jargonelle
stock, the influence by which the latter ;
seemed to resist the attack of the aphis
might be imparted to the apple. This he i
accordingly tried three or four years, ago
and the result has not only answered
Mr. M'Hardj's expectations in regard to
. the health ofthe wood, but in the improve- j
^ ment ofthe 'ruit, both as to the size and J
flavor. Spetimens of the wood and fruit
from the infected tree, and from the en- |
grafted one, ere at present to be seen at f

marks in tie leaves of these two species, j
not neceswry to be here mentioned.
Probably Vilmot's early scarlet Rhubarb
is a variet; of the Rhapontic, and there
may exist nany other varieties.
The Hybrid species has verv large;
leaves; wten under good cultivation, they '
will often neasure four or even five feet
in length, ?d of a proportionate width;
they are sanewhat cordate, smooth and
of a light geen or glaucous color.
These three species are cultivated for
the stems o the lower leaves, which come i
to maturity earlier in the spring than the j i
, gooseberry tnd other fruits for which it, <
is a substitute j the Hybrid affords the <
CHt]
most abundant and succulent supply for
these purposes. Rheum derives its name
from the ancient name of the River, which
watered its native region ; the Rha, now
named the Volga, emptying itself into the
Northern shore of the Caspian Sea.
All the species of this plant may be
propagated from the seeds or from the
roots; if from the seed, which is the best
mode, in February or March, sow the seeds
about six inches apart in a light deep and
rich soil; well pulverized, for depth and
richness of soil are indispensable requisites
for good healthy plants.
In the autumn of the same year, if you
have taken good care to water and t>
shelter them from the scorching suns of
the summer, the plants will he fit to transplant
into their beds ; young plants r iquire
careful watering, even when it
wouid be injnrious to older roots ; and we
have seen them protected from the sun
by driving down on the south side of
each plant, a board about twelve inches
wide, and slanting so as to break the sun's
rays in the middle of the day and yet
let the air and light have free action upon
the plant. In this way you can in all
October have them put out so as to produce
leaves for the next spring :
When the roots are divided for transplanting,
you must retain a bud on the
crown of each section. Before transplanting
either these sections or the young
plants from seed, select a light soil, rather
inclined to sandy, have it highly manured
and spaded up to the depth of three spits
of twenty-one inches, and thoroughly pulverized?then
set out the Rhapontic or
the Undulate in rows at the distance of
three feet by two?but the Hybrid at five
feet by four.
They will now oftly require to be kept
free from weeds and to have the ground
occasionally stirred up with a three tined
fork or a rake, adding every spring a good
dressing of well rotted manure, stirred
into the earth as deeply as possible, and
your bed will continue good for many
ron ro
The advantages of having the petioles
or leaf stalks blanched for all culinary
purposes, are two-fold. i. e. the desirable
qualities of improved appearance and of
flavor, as well as a saving in the quantity
of sugar, necessary to render them agreeable
to the palate; for the blanched leaf
stalks are much less harsh than those
grown under the full influence of light in
an open situation.
This plant may be* forced by placing
flower barrels or tight boxes over a few
plants and covering them over with fresh
stable manure or by some of the other
methods iu Gardening, directed for forcing
vegetables. By covering over all
the roots to the depth of a few inches with
leaves or light litter er any other protection
from cold, the Rhubarb leaves will

removed as soon as the weather becomes
warm, carefully avoiding to injure the
voung shoots that mav have started.
W O w?
Whenever you would gather the petioles
remove the earth a little from the
crown of the root, and somewhat bending
down the leaf, which you would remove,
then slip it off with your hand, without using
a knife 01 breaking the stalk. The i
leaf stalks may be gathered as soon as
they arc half grown or are sufficiently expanded
; but a much larger produce can
be obtained by letting them remain until
until full expansion has taken place, when
the full grown stalks are gathered and
tied up in bundles of about a dozen each,
and thus exposed for sale in the market.
Some of the leaf stalks are two or three
long and over.

As letting the stalks run up to flower
would weaken the powers of tha roots for

We have not yet obtained a copy of

" On looking over this volume we were

an interest in the promotion of that truly

the earth. This wo should have
done with that kind of a caveat which i
would be becoming one who professes little
knowledge of the science of chemistry
generally, and can boast, perhaps, of
little more of the business of tilling the <
earth. But we find that profound chemists
have pronounced most favorable upon
Liebig's work, and professed agriculturists
have tested its excellence. And though
we cannot find space for ail that we see

undoubteely to produce a new era
in the science."
Extract from a letter from Dr. Colman,
Commissioner for the Agricultural Survey
of Massachusetts, dated February 15th, ,
1841:
"It is the most valuable contribution
to Agricultural science, which has come
within my knowledge. It takes new
views on many subjects, which have been
long discussed without any progress towards
determinate conclusions; and
reVeals principles which are of the highest
importance. Some of these principles require
further elucidation and proof; but,
in general, they are so well established by
facts within my own observation, that,
in my opinion, the truth, if not already
reached, is not far distant."
From Silliman's Journal, January, 1841:
" It is not too much to say, that the
publication of Professor Liebig's Organic
Chemistry of Agriculture, constitutes an
era of great importance in the history of
Agricultural science. Its acceptance as
a standard is unavoidable, for, following
closely in the straight path of inductive
philosophy, the conclusions which are
drawn from its data .are incontrovertible."
" To some, the style of this work may
seem somewhat obscure; but it will be
found, on a reperusal, that great condensation,
brevity and tersncss, have been
mistaken for obscurity." "We can truly
say, that we have never risen from the
perusal of a hook with a more thorough
conviction of the profound knowledge,
extensive reading, and practical research
of its author, and of the invincible power
and importance of its reasonings and conelusions,
than we have gained from the
present volume."

ON PREPARING NIGHT SOIL.
Sir?I observed a few days ago in one
of your late periodicals, an inquiry, by a
correspondent, for the best method of preparing
night soil for manure. He said
'he had mixed it with Jime, and a very
strong smell of ammonia was evolved,
whereby he feared theelFicacy of the manure
might be impaired. These conclusions
are perfectly correct; its efficacy as
organic manure would be destroyed by the
use of lime.
When an organic body containing nitrogen
undergoes putrefaction, and moisture
present, the nitrogen unites with the
hydrogen of the water and forms ammonia;
the oxygen, the other element of water,
unites with the carbon of the putrify-*
ing body, and form? carbonic acid; both
of these transformations, in their nascent
state, combine and form carbonate of
ammonia, a volatile salt, which is always
evaporating with water, as long as the decomposition
continues. Such invariably
takes place in nitrogenous bodies. (
When lime is added to a body holding ;
carbonate of ammonia in solution, as in
night soil, the ammoniacal salt is decom- I,
posed; the lime robs it of its carbonic acid,
and caustic ammonia, a still more volatile
compound, flies off' in gas; thus we have (
got rid of all the nitrogen the organic com- i
pound contained. |
Organic manure, without nitrogen, is ]
of very little value. It pervades every part
W
l, WEDNESDAY, JUNE
jf the vegetable structure, and no plant ]
ivill attain maturity, even in the richest
mould, without its presence. The relative
value of manure may be known by
the relative quantity of nitrogen it con.
tains. There does not appear to be any
manure so rich in nitrogen as human exi
crement (except bone manure, which con*
tains upwards of 30 per cent, of gelatine
jn its interstices;) so much so, that ac>
cording to the analyses of Macaire and
Marcet 100 -parts of human urine are
equal to 1300 parts of fresh dung of the
, * - - - A . ? * + m rs.
horse, otiu parts ot tne cow, ana 40U parts
of the urine of the horse. Hence it is
evident that it would be of much importance
if none of the human excrements
were lost, especially when we consider
thatMritfctjrery pound of urine a pound of
wheat mignt be produced. Now I would
suggest to your correspondent the best
and most economical method I know of
preserving unimpaired the. most valuable
element in night soil, which is as follows
: To every 100 lbs. of night soil add
7 Ids. of sulphato of lime (gypsum) in
powder, a double decomposition will ensue,
and the result will be, instead of sulphate
of lime and carbonate of ammonia,
carbonate of lime and sulphate cf ammonia;
the latter a soluble salt which cannot
be volatilized. It might now be mixed
with other compost, or dried any way
thought proper, and applied to the roots
of the vegetable, to be again transformed
into bread, butter, cheese, Acc.
Chloride of calcium, sulphuric or muriatic
acid, substances of low price, would
completely neutralize the urine, convert,
ing its ammonia into salts which posses
no volatility.
I would also suggest that if the floors
of stables be strewed from time to time
with a little sulphate of lime, they will
Irsj all their offensive smell, and none of
the ammonia which forms con be lost,
but retained in a condition serviceable as
manure. In close stables the horses'
health would be better preserved, and
they would not be so liable to get blind a9
now. 1 3-4 lbs. of sulphate of lime will
fix as much ammonia as is produced by
100 lbs. of heree's urine.
I am sir, your obedient servant,
GREGORY BRABYN.
SMALL BIRDS.

Massachusetts, at the Session before the
last by the Rev. Mr. Peabody, which has
just fallen into our hands, he remarks, that
"to exterminate birds which do a little
harm occasionally, is to protect ourselves
from a small evil at the expense of a greater,
and in fact securing the fruit at the
expense of the tree. Means may be devised
to prevent the ravages of birds, but
none have yet been discovered to prevent
the ravages of insects. The birds guard
our fields, and gardens from the insect;
and if they, now and then, taste of the
fruit which they have preserved, we can
better afford a share to them, than the
whole to their creeping enemy. To
give some idea of the service which birds
are able to render. Mr. Peabody notices
the computation of Wilson, according to
which, a red winged blackbird devours on
an average fifty grubs a day?a pair of
them, in four months, will consume
twelve thousand?and allowing a million
pair of blackbirds to New England, (which
is but a moderate estimate) they will destroy
twelve thousand millions of the
grub. He also notices the statement of
Kalm that after some states had paid three
pence a dozen for the destruction of blackbirds,
the consequence was a total loss in
the year 1749, of all the grass and grain,
by means of insects which had flourished
uuder the protection of the law allowing
bounties on birds.1'

by the opposite course; without suffi

at the same time there is nothing to
which capital can be applied with greater
certainty of a fair return/or liberal expenditure,
when correctly employed, than

expenditure he directed with judgement,
it will be found that the profit upon the
outlay increases in more than a proportionate
degree to its amount; thus, supposing
twenty.five dollars be the lowest, and
fifty the highest sum that can be employed
in the common culture of the same
acre of land, it is more than profitable
that if twenty.five return at the rate of
ten per cent., the fifty dollars will yield
twenty, or any intermediate sum, at the
same progressive ratio. And admitting
this to be true?and it ispresumed no experienced
agriculturist will doubt it?it
follows, that a capital of 5,000 dollars,
expended in the cultivation of 200 acres,
will only yield a profit of 500 dollars,
while, if applied to no more than 100
acres, it would produce 1,000 dollars ;
therefore, it is evident that his profit
would be increased by diminishing the

The Rohan Potatoe.
Of the productive nature of this new variety
of this excellent'root, there is no dif.
ference of opii^on? for every one who has
givenit a fair trf?l admit its great superiority
in this respect* But'there are those
who decry its claims^ a vegetable for
table use. By some it Ftbeen denounced
as a coarse watery things *** on'y ^or
food of stock. To such op^n'on' dissent
in toto; and I do so from an e xperience of
two years. During the last w?nter and
present spring I have had no oth*.%r potato
upon my table, artd I affirm tha/ f?r
flavor and mealiness, it stands only s^"
ond in my estimation to all other varieties
that I have ever eaten of. It was
but yesterday I partook of it, and instead
of being coarse and watery, It was dry,
mealy, and of excellent flavor. Indeed as
a potato for spring use I think it equal
to any other; not even making an exception
in favor the justly celebrated Mercer.
Without any covering, my Rohnns
have kept well in my cellar from last fall
until now, and they are just as sound as
they were when they were taken up.
In strong sandy loam, well manured
and tended, I am justified from actual
trial in saying, that they will yield from 500
to 700 bushels per acre- Such being the
case, are they not entiled to the consideration
of every agriculturist who farms for
prfiit? I leave the solution of this question
to others, and will conclude by ob

On the Culture of Wheat.
There is good reason to believe that the
export from Lake Erie of this great Western
staple will not fall below ten million
of bushels during the present season.?
Any improvement in the production of an
article of such immense importance tot he
commerce of Buffalo and to all classeswho
desire an abundnace of good cheap bread,;
cannot fail to interest our readers, Hence j
no apology is necessary for devoting con- 1
siderable space in our columns to detailing !
the practical results of careful experiments
made in Great Britten with a view to 1
cheapen the expense of culture, and augment
both the quantity and quality of
wheat grown on an acre in the highest 1
degree.
Colonel Le Couteur, of the Island of *
Jersey, has recently made some impor. 1
tant discoveries in the propagation of 1
wheat plants their adaptation to peculiar
soil both natural and artificial, and, in the
whole process, of obtaining the greatest 1
amount of the best flour at the least ex- j
pence of land and labor. From somestrange
oversight, his valuable work upon 'wheat," 1
and his "Essay on pure and improved.;
Varieties of Wheat lately introduced in- 1
to England," which received a prize of
twenty sovereigns, have not been repub- 1
lished in this country. And we are indebted
to Mr. Le Cras, lately a resident '
of the island of Jersey, for the perusal of (
these works, and the privilege of making <
an abstract of such portions as we deem
of most service to the wheat-growers of the 1
United States.
Mr. Le Couteur has succeeded in producing,
by crossing the different kinds of
wheat formerly cultivated, over 150 varieties
and sub-varieties of this grain. He
commenced his experiments some six
years ago by selecting a few of the best 1
heads of wheats from fourteen of the most 1
esteemed varieties cultivated in England. !
The kernels in these heads were all care
fully counted and planted in seperate par-1,
eels, and treated alike in every respect as
to soil and culture. The result demon- ;
strated an astonishing difference both in <
the productiveness and quality of these '
several varieties of wheat. No kernals '
were counted except such as grew, and \
the experiment was most satisfactorily
conducted in every respect. Sixty-one ]
grains of white Dantzic gave 3 lbs. 3 oz. i
of wheat, and 31bs. 9 oz. of straw; where- '
as 59 grains ef what had been regarded 1
as a choice, variety of red wheat gave only j

^he experienced whe^JUgrower in thf
ountry would be rejoiced to cultii&'e a
ariety of wheat which would yield him
good crop of straw bearing an amount
f grain one-third larger in weight than
he straw itself. And yet this was ohained
at the first experiment, as stated
hove.
The auther selected five or six varieties
>f these fourteen several parcels and cultivated
some of them at great pains in thek*
rure state, while he commenced a judicious
system of crossing with othc s, for-'
he purpose of producing new varieties
juperior to any of them. In this in was ,
[uite successful. To prevent mistake
ind undesirable mixing of different varteies
of wheat when in blossom, one pistil
m a head was preserved, while all the
)ollen was carefully removed. T.iis pisil
was fructified by the selected pollen,
ind only one kernal was produced, which,
ivhen planted, sometimes yielded l,0(Kh
<ernais of the new variety. By pursoing
:his coars for a series of years, and cultivating
his seed wheat by itself and |ffo?
pag.itmg from those kinds only which
produced the most and best fiour with the
least bran, Colonel Le Couteur now obtains

AMERICAN SOCIETY OF AGRICULTURE.
Art address lo the farmers of the United
States; to every friend of igricultmral
improvement: to every citizen of the United
States who desires to see elevated the
character and standing of Vie cultivators
of American soil.
Most respected and most respectable
friends and brothers, give me your attention
for a few fleeting moments; your
humble brother, who now addresses you,
published a suggestion about three years
ago, for the purpose of arousing your attention
to the subject of forming a National
Agricultural Society; that suggestion
was then responded to with a hearty good
will throughout the country. But action
upon the subject ha9 been overwhelmed
by the political whirlwind that has swept
over our country, in the first lull of the
succeeding calm, the proposition to form
such a society lias been renewed, and
with one exception, has met with a cheer
->-?? i *? - a xr
ing " uoa speea ine project. none
doubt the utility of the proposed society,
yet doubtless there are many who would
like to see the objects, end and aim of the
society more fully explained. To such I
now offer some of ray viiws, and in doing
so, invite you all to give yours; for
this is one of the objects of a National Society
to interchange our views.
Many warm friends of the measure, wno are
anxious to see the society in operation, cannot
see how it is|to be organized. They say,"No
doubt if once organized, it would daily increase
in strength and usefulness; but it is
like a great complicated piece of machinery,
of great use and value when once in motion,
but difficult to start." Now, to me there is
no difficulty in they way. /II that is wanted
is a lew active engineers to put the maehine
in motion. I mmediate and decided aetion of
a few of the active friends of agricukt>ralira~
>..?..at*ian? uftin mnat SiiDlirTUl tWrMmnM ML,
ify to act as engineers as well as pioneers for
the whole Union; and having once gives the
society an existence, it wilf flourish and' increase
in strength just as oar polities] Union
has done.
The following plan of organizing the society
is suggested to your consideration.
Let as many of the friends of tho project
as can be induced to do so, meet at the Citf
if Washington, on some day of the antumn
rfl841? (the particular day to be hereafter
Bxed,) and there form a constitution for the
wiely, and elect officers, to wit; a President,,
a Vice President for each state, a recording
Secretary, a general corresponding Secret**
ry, and a corresponding Secretary for each'
State, county, city and principal town in tbe[Jnited
States, a treasurer, and probably a
publisher of a national paper, to be called the
lournal of the American Society of Agrical,
Lure. _
