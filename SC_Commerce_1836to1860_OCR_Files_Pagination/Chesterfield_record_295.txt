Xcw kind of Wheat.
To the EJitors of tho Chruleatown, Va. Free
Pre*?.
Having aoen n late article in your valuable
paper, which culls the attention of the
ngricolturists of our county to a wheat which
19 denominated the "Rock Wlieat," I have
thought thai it was in my power, to advance
rhe farming mteres's, hy statin? a few facts
in relation to a dcscripiion of Wheat introduced
unto litis county by Mr. Samuel
McPherson, from the State of New York.
The wheat is called **The White Bearded
Wheat." Its productiveness, i should think
u)!l exceed, if possible, that of the Rock
Wheat, as the heads contain a much larger
number of gTains than that wheat is represented
to contain. Sixty is a very common
number of grains to be contained in a head
mid as high as eighty odd is not uncommon.
1 h*ve frequently found contained in the
*r?p?h?s fine trains abreast. Last year Mr.
McPherson raised one hundred and forty
bushels from five and a half sown. And
this year in a field on ihe sime farm,
(which is the thinnest land on the farm,)
the average has been thirtv-two bushels to
lite .acre. It bus another advantage which
is, that it has a very stiff straw, and does
not grow tail, and will stand erect when
other wheat is prostrated around it
which 1 had an opportunity of observ.
ir.g this sejson. In enumerating the od
vantages of this wheat, it is proper 10 state
the disadvantage w hich attend >!? The)
are these : It is p one to shatter, and toe
early a wheat to make it prudent in a far.flier
to sow his whole crop of this wheat.
These reinaks are not intended to disparage
the merits of t4The Rock Wheat," a?
it ts doub less a valuable wheat, (and with
thai belief I shall endeavor to proenre som
of if, and will be substituted in place of th<
Blue Stem," which is acknowledged b)
the majority of our farmers to have degen
crated. I neglected to mention above, tha
fhe White Wneatio which I refer is sup<
posed to be a different wheat from tha
introduced into the country by Mr. Wi lian
HotF, as bis is a iate wheat, and I understand
came from the Slate of Ohio.
If you think the information contained it
this note of sufficient importance to the far
mers of the county, to occupy a place it
your columns, you have my permission t<
give it publication. R. S. Blackburn.
P. S.?To prevent needless application!
for this wheat, I will state I have engage'
all I have 10 spare to my neighbors one
friends, nnd could have disposed of thou,
sands if I had them, as every one is enrap
lured with the wh'-ai who has either seen ii
grow, or seen it af er it has been cieamc
tip.
It is possible that some of my neighbor!
snay have some oi the Wheat to spare.

Bow to ''Stop that Horse."
Almost every one knows what vexatior
it is to have a horse that is " hard to catch1
when in the pasture.
We well remember the many u secrc
rcu.cs" that we have had with a venerabh
old mare that belonged to the family wher
we were "in our teens." She seemed tc
consider it a signal of a trial of speec
whenever any of the boys approached hei
with a bridle in their hands. We have
learned better since, than to waste so muct
lime or breath, in such pursuit, for we verity
believe (hat a horse that can't outrun ui
ia'nt worth catching. We saw a contrivance
the other day adopted by Mr. Joe
Savage Augusta, which we consider as ?
sort of self slopping machine. He has i
horse which had rattier run than be caught
He put a strap round her neck to which h
attached a common trace chain and let i
drag. This is no incumbrance to tin
horse except when he begins to run. Hi
will then invariably s'ep upon it and brinj
himself to a dead hail by his own strength

Cheap mode of Raising Water by j
traterwheel and Band.
In conversation the otherday with Mr,
Blako, of Augusta, upon the various plam
and modes that are now in use for raising
water, he suggested the idea of attaching
a b ather band around the shaft of a waterwheel,
to which should be attached tir
elevator* like those used for carrying uj
meal and flour in flour mills. The lowe;
part of the band might dip into the water
receive a supply and passing over a pullej
ut any required height, carry it up ant
empty it in'o a cistern at the top, Ironr
whence it cc uld be conveyed by tubes to an}
distance and to as high an elevation as the
cistern. In many places this cheap systcn
would do as well or better than a forct
pump. The cost would not be great anc
the chances of getting out of repair woult
he very few. Ibid.
COLORING WALLS.
It may not be generally known, partic.
ularly in the country, that blue vitriol wher
mixed with lime, forms a very beautiful a?
well as exceedingly cheap coloring mottei
for walls. Take good iime and slack it
as usual, one and a half pounds of blue vit
riol. dissolve the chrystals with boiling wa
tor, when dissolved mix it with the white,
wash, and add one pound o! glye welt dis
solved. This should be prepared in a g!uf
pot if possible, to prevent its being burner
or scorched. When well mixed the firsi
coat must be put on horizontally or from
aide to side, and the second coat vertically
or up and down. The wall will be of a
bright blue color, resembling the blue boL
ties some times seen in apothecary shops.
By following these directions, women can
put on the coloring as smoothly and as well
generally as men.
The use of Spectacles.
The last number of the Boston Medical
and Surgical Journal has the following remarks,
in reference to the use of spectacles.
They are "important if true," and there is
no reason to doubt their accuracy.
"It is one of die gross mistakes of approaching
age, that people at such limes
imagine a necessity for spectacles, when in
f act, in eighty coses out of ti hundred, the
eye-sight is positively injured by them. If
we tamper with our eyes, and interpose
glasses between the cornea and the object,
a re modification and readjustment of the
parts within necessarily follow?and when?
this new arrangement has once been established,
it is no easy matter to restore the
organs to their former primitive condition.
Age brings with it a relaxation of the tension
of all the tissues, and the eye suffers
tem|)orarily with the entire system, but soon
? reacts, having within i's constitution a
principle of adaptation, according to the cir- i
cumstances, habits and condition of the indi.
vidual. From forty, five to fifty, a period
when glasses are erroneousy supposed
indispensable, where they are resorted to at i
all, although there be a defeclive vision at
the former local distance, in reading for
example, the sight would soon begin to improve,
and finally, to all intents and purposos,
in a majority of instances would be
re-established. It is a law, and strange it
is that its indications are not more observed
that the eye, at every period of life, will
accommodate itself to the wants and necessities
of the individuals?provided it is
not artificially deranged. Imperfect vision,
-- ! -r ?i? i
mo eviis oi near.sigincuwhs, miu m.ofortune
of not seeing distinctly in old ngc,
1 were never heard of as being universal till
opticians h id become numerous. We do1
not deny the utility of spectacles after they
1 have been once re ortod io ; but we perfectly
agree with Dr. Wallace in saying
that they are rarely necessary. Near,
sighted children are often kepi in that state
through life bv being early furnished with
concave spectacles. Withhold them alto1
gethcr, and eye would, in exact obedience
1 to the laws of its organization, adopt itself
! to the labor required. But when the g'as!
ses are once put on, they must ever after be
retained.
Incalculable injury has been five renult of
the fashionable folly of wearing qmzing
' glasses. Both gentlemen and ladies, in the
I spring tide of youth, whose eyes are without
1 a single defect, peep through these useless
' appendages of supposed gentility, till a permanent
and incurable d.fficuby ensues,
' which time has no power to correct, which
consists in a want of agreement in the focus
1 of two organs. Unless the surface on which
) the image impinges on the retina perfectly
agree in both eyes, there will be distorted
> and indistinct vision?such as this kind of
' object or prospect glasses produces."
' [We know a gentleman who four or five years
ago began to experience some difficulty in reading
by candle light, and found it necessary, even
in tho day, to seek a strong light to make a pen.
Hoping that, by U6C, the eyo would accommodate
itself to tho physical changes brought about by
advancing age, he submitted to the inconvenience
as well as he could for a year or more, when he
procurod a pair of spectacles; whic' , however,
he very rarely used except in making a pen, while
I his daily occupation required him^to read much,
' the greater part of it printed with small type.?
In doing this he found it necessary for some time
[ to seek a favorable light, and he was carclul to
I hold his book or paper as near bis eyes as he
i could without straining them so much as la give
i (pain. The result is that he has laid his
' spectacles aside and has nonopened them for more
' than six months. He makes a pen in ordinary
light without difficulty, and reads the finest
1 print with ease at little if any more than the
common distance from the eye. The eye does
1 net always accommodate itself to the dieianee
' as readily now as it did in early lifo. But it is
' now painful to read with the book as far removed
1 as was most agreeable twelve months since.?
1 How long ihis fovarable change may last, time
' only can determine. It is probable the same
" effect would not have been produced had the
eyes been less excercised in reading fine print.

THE CAPTURED SLAVES.
To the Editor of the Compiler,
i Gentlemen?The articles which you sent
mo from the Northern papers, in relation
to the persons in custody for offences alledg'
ed to have been committed on board a
\ Spanish vessel, suggest several questions of
\ a good deal of interest.
Il these persons are charged with having
1 committed on the high seas the crime oi
) piarcy as defined by the luw of nations, there
r> is no doubt that they may be tried before
a Circuit Court of the United States. If they
' hnd been found in this country, the trial
' would have been in the Circuit for that Dis1
irict in which they were found. Being
" brought into the United States, the trial takes
' place before the Circuit Court lor the dis1
tricl into which they were first brought.
' 1 apprehend, however, that the offence
' really committed is not an offence against
' all nations, and like piracy punishable by
any. The fact charged seems to be murder
and robbery on board of a ship belong,
ing exclusively to subjects of a foreign State;
' and it appears to be an offence only against i
1 the nation on board whose vessel the mur1
der and robbery have been committed, and
I ??Ivl.. A?/i)iia!ualv Ku nntinn. If
puiiisi'duiu cauuonnj <*>j iiuuum. >
' would be otherw ise if subsequently the per..
sons on board the vessel had thrown of its
' national character, cruised piratically and
committed piracy on other vessels. Then
' again the offenders would be persons who
plight be tried as pirates in the courts of
the Union. But I do not see any thing of
its kind any where alleged. It is scarcely
necessary to add that in the view I take of
the case, the trial for piracy in the courts of
the Union must result in an acquittal.
When thus acquitted, they will no doubt
be claimed as the property of Spanish sub.
jects.?Whether or no the Courts of the
United States will recognize them as property,
will depend upon whether they appear
to be property according to the laws of
Spain. Questions of this sort are not new
in this country. The stiongest case on the
tsubject is that of the"Antelope?10 Wheat.
66.
Tl?e material facts ofibat case were as
follows : A privateer called the Columbia,
sailing under a Venezulean commission, entered
the port of Baliimore in the year
1810 ; clandestinely shipped a erew ofthir
y or forty men; proceeded to sea ; hoisted
he Arragan fl ig, assuming the name of the
Arraganta; and prosecuted a voyage along
the coast of Africa, her officers and thegrea.
for part of her crew being citizens of the
United States. Off the coast of Africa, she
captured an American vessel from Bristol,
in Rhode Island, from which 6he look twenty
five Africans. She captured several Portugese
vessels, from which she also took
Africans. And she captured a Spanish
vessel, called the Antelope, in which she
took a considerable number of Africans.
The two vessels then sailed in company to
the coast of Brazil, where the Arraganta
was wrecked, and her mnster, Afetcalf, and
a great part of her crew made prisonersThe
rest of the crew, with the armament
of the Arraganta, were transferred to the
Antelope, which, thus armed, assumed the
name of the General Ramirez, under the
command of John Smith, a citizen of the
United States. On board this vessel were
all the Africans which had been captured by i
the privateer in the course of her voyage.
The vessel, thus freighted, was found hovering
near the coast of the United States b>
the revenue cutter Dallas, under the command
of Captain Jackson, and finally
brought into the port of Savannah for ndjudication.
The Africans,at the time of her
capture, amounted to upwards of two hundreJ
and eighty. On their arrival, ilm vess"ls
and the Africans were libelled and
claimed by the Portuguese and Spanish
Vice Consuls, reciprocally. The case was
carried up to the Supreme Couitof the United
States and there argued by Mr. Berrien
and Mr. Chas. J. Ingcrsol in favor of the
claimants, and by Mr. Wirt and Mr. Key
on behalf of the United States, The U.
States asserted no property in tnemseives, i
but insisted on the right of the Africans (
to freedom. The Consuls of Spain and |
Portugal respectfully demanded them as
slaves ; who had in the regular course of
1
legitimate commerce been acquired as prop,
erty by the subjects of their respective
sovereigns. Chief Justice Marshall delivered |
the opinion of the Court, in which he reviewed
the decisions'of tin-English Court of
Admirality, nud laid itdfwn as the principle
of those decisions, "that the legality of the
capture of a vessel engaged in the slave
trade depends on the law of the country to
which the vessel belongs. If that la v gives
its sanction to the trade, restitution will be
decreed ; if that law prohibits it, the vessel
and cargo will be condemned as a good
prize."
The decision in the case of the Antelope
was made some years since the act of Congress
making it piracy for a person to be
engaged in the slave trade who is a citizen
of the United Stales, or one of the crew of a
vessel owned by or navigated for citizens
of the United S;ates. It was considered thai
the legislation of this country on this subject
operated only on its own citizens and vessels?that
one nation could not prescribe
a rule for other nations?and of course that
one nation could not make a law of nations.
In the present case the persons dotaiqgd
on board the vessel as slaves are said to
have come from a Spanish Island, and to
have been legally held as slaves by the
laws of Spain. How the fact will turn out
I do not know, aud therefore say nothing
about it. C. R.
Mr. Willis, one of the editors of the
"Corsair" who married in England a few
years since is now on a visit to that country,
and furnishes a seri -s of letters for the
Corsair. From one of th'.'sc' letters ifhich
gives an account of a ball "at Alma ks"
we make the following extract.
The bust and neck of almost every lady
within reach of our eyes might have served
as models forsculpture. From the zone 10
the chin, English women from seventeen
to thirty are almost invariably superb. Wo
looked in vain for a hollow chest or a bent
back, or what is sometimes called a " thread
unper looking girl." The shoulders full
were dazzling, tind of the healthiest tint of
white, and the carriage of the whole bust
graceful and stately. Within these limits I
think (and my friend thought with me) lie
all the perfections of the English Venus.
We looked at features. There was scarce
a classic forehead or nose in the room
At the feet?they were rather of useful than
of ornamental proportion to the figure.?
At the grace of the dancers?you could not
find in all France so indifferent a dancer as
the best at Almack's. At the complexion
?ruddy and coarse ; though for the best
of reasons, that probably every lady on the
floor had been on horseback three or four
L j_ ? ,
nours every any in ine season, expuseu iu
the tender mercies of a riding-hat, and such
sun and wind us pleases the clerk of Eng.,
lish weather.
We busied ourselves composing a Venus
from the national beau ics. The French
furnished the limbs and grace of movement;
the Greeks and Asiatics the nose and forehead
; the English, hair, throat, neck, and
bust ; the American, compl- xion, feet, and
eyes. The mouth was still to be provided but
we agreed to share the honors of that feature
between us. All this of course might be
disputed on individual exceptions, but it is
curious how nearly universal are these perfections
to the nation to which we name
them.
in the course of the eveuhig I found myself
vis a vis in the quadrille to the Queen's
most beautiful Maid of Honor. She is a
daughter of Lord R-vers, rather tall, and
combining a most majestic embonpoint of
figure will) n slightness of limo and a slenderness
and statehness of neck seldom seen
in such graceful proporiion. To the ?300
? year which Maids of Honor receive for
dress, the Queen, my partner informed me,
has added another hundred, thinking the
sum insufficent. You know, probably that
on their marriage they receive also a dowry
of ?1,000. Then there are the Ladies
in Wailing, who are of the highest rank of
nobility, and llio Bedchamber women, who
receive also ?300 a year, and are generally
ladies of good birth io reduced circumstan
ces. These nil take their turns of service .?
for two months together. <
My pretty and noble informant pave me i
these household statistics very good natur- i
edly between pa so rale and dos a dos ; \
and as she was closely connected with <
those who had the best opportunity of ?
knowing, I asked her a question or two j
touching the personal qualities of her Ma. i
jesiy. She thought Victoria fancied herself
very beautiful, " which she was not,"
and a very good horseman,44 which she
was not decidely," and that she was very I
impatient of a difference of opinion when I
in private withAer Ladies. She admitted,
hpweyer, that she was generous, forgiving
and cleverer than most girls of her age.
When alone with two or three of her maids,
she said, the Queen was no more like a
Queen than any body else," and was very
fond of a bit of fun or a bit of scandal, or
tiny thing that would not have done if other
people were present." As far as it went,
I should think this might be relied on as
the impression her Majesty makes upon
those wiio daily associate with her.
A MOST EXTRAORDINARY DISCLOSURE.
The facts disclosed in the subjoined testimony,
on oath, by Col. Pleasonton, of
Ph.ladelpbia, are so very extraordinary,
that nothing short of our knowledge of the
h..,k /.! ifiwtor nnd nrrsnnnl worth of the de
"'fa" - i
ponent coulJ have induced us lo believe
the reality of his narrative. As it is, how.
ever, the facts which he relates may be
safely pronounced, foratfrocity and diabolism
of spirit without precedent or parallel.
Nat. Intel.
From the Harrisburg Chroniole.
We most earnestly call the attention of
the people of Pennsylvania to the horrible
disclosures made below. If a baser con*
spiracy was ever contemplated, we have
yet to hear of it. The person giving this
testimony is no partisian ; a man of much
reputation and high standing, and was one
of Gen. Patterson's principal officers, when
that officer marched to Harrisburg to quell
the rioters.
A. J. Pleasonton appeared before the
committee, and being duly sworn according
to law, deposed as follows :
Question. Please state any conversation
you had with any person connected with
the late dis'urbances at Harrisburg ; or a
member of either branch of the Legislature
in relation to the intention of the Committee
of Safely, or of those who acted with them,
tearing up the railroad, or any other act, so
as to prevent the troops under Gen. Patterson's
command reaching Harris'' urg.
Ansiccr. I do not know what the intention
of the committee or those connected
with them was; I had no conversation with
any one on the subject of the intention of
those persons ; I have no knowledge of any
thing done in Philadelphia, except such as
is derived from common rumor. It was
cuirently reported every where in Philadelphia,
before the troops left for Harrisburg,
that they would be prevented from marching,
or would be obstructed in their pro.
gress to the State Capitol, and the moan* to
accomplish this was said to be the removal
of some of the rails on the railway. There
was much excitement in Philadelphia on the
reception of the Governor's orders, and the
rumors assumed the complexion of the political
parlies who originuted them. I had
been informed by Gen. Patterson that the
persons who were to have removed the rails
were prevented from so doing by the interference
of some of the officers of the voIubteers
themselves, who represented to them
tlio innjury that would result to their friends
from the execution of such an intention.
/1.1/iali/ia A. i If. J?/l./<7/l<l Plonca frt
V^tiro IV it try iUf x^u* ivuai/ tu
state whether you had any conversation with
any oflhe Van Buren members of either
branch of the Legislature ns to what the
Van Buren party, or any portion of it, designed
to do in order to prevent the troops
under Gen. Patterson from reaching Marrisburg?
Answer On the 20th of January last, I
called to see Col. M'Elwee, a member of
the House of Representatives from Bedford,
on some public business, at his lodgings, in
the evening. He was undressed, and about
to go to bed, but entered into conversation
with mo on the subject of my business; in
the course of which he referred to the character
of the volunteer troops from Philadelphia,
who had been in service in the preceding
month of December at this place. Ho
spoke very favorably of them, and said that
it was well for them that so many of them
were Democrats, as otherwise they would
never have lived to have reached Harris
burg. He then stated that on the announcem?nt
here that the troops from Philadelphia
1 - - - n
would obey the order ol tne vxovernor, aoa
would march for Harrisburg, it was agreed
by himself and two or three others whom
he did not name, to prevent their arrival at
this place at all hazards, supposing at the
moment that, as the troops belonged to
Philadelphia, they were ail Whigs, and favorable
to the State Administration. To
carry out this agreement, he said it was de..
termmed to remove a few of the rails on the
rail road at the most dangerous part of it,
and also to form a mine under this exposed
part, to be filled with gunpowder, so that in
the confusion which would arise from the
train of curs containing the troops being
overthrown by thus running off the track,
the mine might be sprung, and the whole
body of them be blown into the air together!
For this purpose, he himself had purchased
three barrels of gunpowder, and said that he
had paid forty dollars out of his own pocket
I for the purchase. To convince me that
I he was serious in what he stated to have
been their design, he further said that his
associates therein were men of tried cour
age, and, having been officers of the army
during last war, knew how to execute the
project they hod conceived.
This design was abandoned by them in
consequence of information having been re.
ccived subsequen'ly to the purchase of the
gunpowder, that the troops then on their
route from Philadelphia were not all of the
samo political party, a large portion of them
belonging to the Democratic party, to which
Col M'Elwee end his associate* in this iK
sign also belong. He further said that it
was to this circumstance alone that the arrival
of the troops from Philadelphia at Harrisburg
without injury or loss was to be attributed.
The design was abandoned because
it would have been impossible to have
separated the Democrats from the Whigs
in its execution, and protected them from
[he d inger of the explosion.
A.J. PLEASONTON.
[Col. Plkaso.\ton, in explanation]
I deem it prop1 r to state to the C mimittec.
lest some person might suppose that I
had been instrumental in causing my testimony
on this subject to be adduced, that I
have never mentioned this conversation before
my exanrnafon to-day to any but to
one gentleman from a neighboring S.aie,
wh) was casually hero in attendance on
public business, and with whom I was in
the habit of daily intercourse.
Wlien on the eve of his departure from
llirrisburg. he incautiously repealed the
substance of this conversation to a member
of the S.-natc, and mentioned my name us
that of his authority for his statement.?
That Senator caused me to be supcenaed
as a witness before this committee. When
I learned for what object i had been thu9
subpoenaed, I declined to give my testimony
until I had stated these circumstances to
Col. M'Elwee. This I did this morning. Col.
M'Elwee made no objections to my giving
his conversation in evidence, and according
ly 1 have answered the question which the
committee have proposed to me.
A. J. PLEASONTON.
Since the above was in type we see it stated in
an administration paper that the whole was a
hoax ; that McElwce deceived Pieasonton with
a false story.
The following petition to the County Court of
Lincoln, N. C. has been published in the Lincoln
Republican.
State of North Carolina, Lincoln County:
Your humble Petitioners, to the Wor.
shipful Court of said County : Confessedly,
we acknowledge that your Worshps are
vested wi h authority to grant a license to
tavern-keepers to retail ardent spirits,
when you think that it woiilJ he an advantage
to any Community, and on application
establish such a house, for the convenience
of travellers and others, who might need
that article for medicinal purposes. As
we expect that application will bo made to
you, ai ybur next court for a grant ef license
to retail ardent spirits in our neighborhood }
we your female petitioners have therefore
resolved to send up this our counter petition
to your worships, with a hope that you
will tuke into consideration our remon.
stranceand pl? a against such an establishment.
Nevertheless, on application being
j made for a license so to do, if it seem good
to your Worships to set up a retailing establishment
in our neighborhood, we your petitioners
pray that you will require good
and sufficient security for the orderly conducting
of the same. Your female petitioncrs
remonstrate against your grant ng a license
to any person or persons to retail spirituous
liquors in our neighborhood for the
following reasons:
I. As Wives. Such a house places somt
of us in imminent danger of having th<
marriage vow made with us before God ant
many witnesses, brokf n. It has been prom
ised that we should be loved dearer than alt
if a liscense be granted, another object of i
husband's love may become our rivals, t<
our great grief and mortification. Chastit;
of speech and behavior may be bartered a
such a place, for depravity and abandonmcn
of all good. The promise made for ou
temporal good may be violated ; instead o
pro:ection from abuse and injuries, we mat
be persecuted and injured ; instend of hav
ing contrioutions to our pleasure, peace ani
comfort we may suffer the privation of al
these. Instead of having our edificatioi
and felicity promoted, our feelings may b
iujured, and we made miserable, Such i
house may destroy all social and domestic
peace, betiVecn husband and wife. Jnstcac
of ffnding a guide in a husband, we may b<
doomed to wander alone in the darksomt
wilderness. Instead of enjoying the bless
?..g of conversation by ourfirc^siile, the fa
culty of speech may be prostituted to cursing
and railing. Instead of rendering assis?
tahce in the administration of domestic gov
ernment in the family, all may b> come aft
archy, confusion and disorder. Instead o
cvciy pleasing association connected wit!
the endearing name of husband, nothing er<
long may be left, but the remembrance o
better days, while we may be forced to dnnl
the bitter draught of our suffering tears. VV<
now having living husbands, and possess i
name in the land of the living ; but if u li
cense be granted, we may ere long be lef
in widowhood, forlorn in sackcloth and bath
ed in tears, and yet ashamed to give a his
tory of our husbands' death.
II. As Mothers. Your petitioners urge
that their children may become usele i
YtAmhnrc in k irinli/. It n rannol think o
living, suffering and djing, and leave nove
slige behind, to show how we had aciet
here : we wish ro leave a monwment in oui
children, to ages yet to come, that genera
tions yet unborn may call us blessed. I
1,cense in this case be granted, our chddrei
may be strangers to patcrn d authority an(
discipline, duly administered; and thus grow
up outlaws ; so thry never could serve theii
country in honor. For want of means
1 our children may nercr be able to attain ar
education, to qualify for usefulness in llic
world ; for it may be, their hapless fathers
may spend their t me and substance; in idleness
nnu riot; they themselves may b<come
idle drones upon society, for the want ol
business fathers to direct their energies in
early life. Fur-her J For want ofreligious
precepts and example, our children may
loiter God's holy day away, for want of a
sober father to take them by the hand and
lead them to the house of God, and thus ere
long may rend a tender mother's heart. Our
hope in our children may be indulged, only
to become food for bitter grief and disappointment,
if our plea prevail not with you,
for they themselves may become the unhappy
victims of a licensed house, and thus
w* may be disgraced in the disgrace of out
children, and all our dignity as mothers be
sunk in degradation.
III. As young Ladies. We urge before
your Worships, that if license be granted to
a retailing house in our neighborhood as a
benefit, we shall have too great a benefit;
for already there are the means ofobtaining
all that may be wanted, of the article proposed
to be vended, within two mik's oftho
place asking license. Further :?We hat?
immorality, and such a house must in its
nature pro luce it. Still further. If a IL
cense be granted in this case, your worships
may dig up by the roots all hope ofour future
happiness in this life. The consummation
of human bliss i9 to be found only in the
marriage relation. To this, the common
centre, all civilized nations in live world gra.
viiate. There is no single vice in all tho
black catalogue, which carries in its train
so many evils as drunkenness ; and such
houses invariably make some men such.
There is nothing in the character of a
drunkard which promises us happiness in
an alliance of marriage with him. Every
drunkard is an unjust man ; in him is an utter
want of meekness, charity and love. He
npvtxr linns tin another's tear, he never binds
up a broken heart, he never symphathise3
with a bruised spirit, he never soothes an
honest pang of suffering, be injures often,
but seldom forgives an itttfty done, he never
subdues an evil passidnfhe never adjured
sin, he never does a pious act, nor breathes
a pious prayer, nor wislies a pkwswiah.
He is blind to all the charms of beauty.
Though we offer h m our smiles to light him
through this arksome wilderness, he will
reject them in disdain ; our eyes have no
spelis for liim. in our steps he can seo no
majesty, nor can he hear music in our voice;
our smiles inspire no hop 's ?n him, nor with
him have our actions grace. Our lovs,
the dearest boon ever granted to mortal man,
is no solace to him ; in it he has no delight.
Though we be the very image ofLoVE, our
tears have no power of eloquence with him,
nor is there the note of the lyre found ia
our tongue.
We therefore pray that your Worships
will not reject this our petition ; we leave our
case m your hands, trusting that wisdom will
guide you to act for the good of our com*
munity.

5 SHOOTING A RAT.
s A few weeks since, while the Albany
l and Worcester ra lroad was progressing at
. Palmer, Massachusetts, the workmen em.
1 ployed there were in ihe habit of placing the
r powder they used for blasting in a neigh.
boring grist mill for safety. At one time
they had two unopened kegs, and one with
i the head off and the powder exposed, stand.
J ing in one corner of the mill. Two meo
/ and a boy were* also in the mill at the time,
r and discovered a very large rat, which one
, of them proposed shooting with a doublej
barrelled gun, which was near them. The
) others consented, and the gun was loaded
5 from i be powder kegs, but the rat had hid
. himself. After chasing it round the build*
! ing some time, they at last fired an t killed
the rat, took it up, and were retreating,
when one of the party spoke of the powder,
i Upon looking back, they discovered that
they had fired at the rat behind the powder,
and that the wadding was on fire, and on
the edge of the open keg. With great
t courage and presence of mind, the boy
offered to go and remove it, which he did;
but just as he turned his back from it, tho
whole of the kegs exploded, blowing the
building 10 pieces, killing one of the men
on the spot, and wounding tho other and
i the boy in such a manner that they died
shortly after.?New York Suo.
