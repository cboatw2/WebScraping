Th& Russian mode of paving with hexagonal <
blocks of wood 18 incheslang, sunk in the ground ]
and covered with earth, which was tried in the j
city of N%w York last summer, seems to. have j
succeeded well. Tho Journal of Commerce says: (
"while tho atono paved portion, and ia soino de. (
gtde the mecadamizcd road has been broken into ^
holes, tho wooden blocks remain perfectly firm 1
ana smooth, and not only so, but they became dry j
many days earlier, on the breaking up of winter, c
than any other part of tho road. It is now a ! I
smooth and dry as the deck of a ship." * j t

In the fight between Gen. Clinch's troops
and the Semiuolcs on tlie Ouithlacoocliee, j
express directions were given by Oseola to ^
his Indians, to avoid shooting Lieut. G .! ^
though leading his men into the front and ' $
thickest of the fight?because he and Osco i
la had been friends, and he bad been kind to j
the'poor Indian.' The order was strictly S p
obeyed amid chances innumerable for taking 'in

Zoological Institute.?We extract the fol-'j 1
lowing from the Messenger and Advocate, 1 ^
which, after giving a description ofa few of \?
the animals says? i
We would briefly allude to the splendid j
spectacle we witnessed on Friday evening
last. Mr. \ ancmburgh,"the unrivaled mas- j i
ter of the most powerful and ferocious of the |1
animal crcjti^, entered the two smaller ca- 1;
m ges opposite the door, as you enter tiic spacious
hall of the Institute, and went through ]
with various and surprising feats with the 1
Lioness, the Tigress, the Leopards and the
Lions, now beating their heads against the
sides of the cage, opening their jaws, thrusti
ng his head and arms down their throats,
and now playing or purring them in his lap,
as a oat or dog. A boy and a lamb were
handed in, and the lion lapped the lamb with ;
Ids toncuc, and lying on the lap of rvs mas-!
\
er, the child stood upon the Lion, holding up !5
he lamb.
After this, Mr. Yanamburgli withdrew.
The hall was suddenly darkened, and in a '
short time, while the audience were in a 1
breathless suspense, Mr. V. was discovered 1
tmid the animals in the centre cage; and a t
nostmagnificent display of fire works ren- I
lered the scene grand and beautiful beyond I
iescription. The next moment the fire i1
vorks and the keeper disappeared, and the j y
ights in the hall restored to its former ap- jc
xmrancc. This scene occurred about eight';
>'clock in the evening, and no one who was ;s
lot present, can form an adequate concep- *
ion of the thrilling efTect it produced upon 1
he crowded audience. .
We find the preceding in a Charleston paper j
opied we suppose from some Northern paper, i j
rhe spectacle may have been a "splendid" one, j ^
ut it was one of splendid folly. We never sec j (

It is composed of such medicinal principles as '
.'ere considered most fit to restore the harmony j

nnd with those who have scon its useful

Among a large list of certificates of its efficacy

Iundreds of others in different parts of this coun- j
