Cultivation of Cotton.
Report on the Cultivation ofCo'.ton, read before
the Poe Dae Agricultural Society at its Semi,
annual electing in October 1833, by the
Hon. John Campbell.
The first object of consideration in the
cultivation of cotton is the selection of a soil
tn ;?;? nnJn^tmr.. But us every vn
MIIICU iw j
ricry of soil within the li nits of the Pee De?
conn'ry of sufficient fertility, is found under
a judicious system of cultivaiiofiflujptd a
good return for the labor bcstowed^ipoQ it,
and as a committee ins been appgifltpd by
this society to report particularly upon manures,
it is thought unnecessary to make anv
comment upon this branch of the subject;
except to remark, that from an exhausted
koil, or one naturally poor, and unimproved
by art, it is vain for the planter even with
the mostAprable seasons, to expect an
abundant nWvest.
The field being selected and the proper
seuson having arrived, the first operation is
to prepare it for planting.
In pro;>eqtepreparing land for planting
short staple cotton good ploughing is indispensable,
and among the rules which may
be laid down as admitting of no modification,
are these : la very part of the so 1 should
be turned and effectually pulverized; and
the depth of furrow on all lands should bo
regulated by the stratum which dividt j
the fertile from the unfertile moulds. There- '
ton1, in the bre iking up or preparation of
land, the plough maj go as deep as the soil
tvlll admit, but not deeper, and from the
violation of t lis rule which nature has provided
as a criterion, thin soils are sometimes
much injured.
hiirht and drv mouohihat are easily [>ul- !
? n . ^ .
verizjd may be ploughed immediately
before planting. Ilut on clayey so Is, where
tae extremes of wet and dry present the
the disagreeable aheruativea of mire or
clods, the best season of ploughing is often
short a id critical, an 1 such sods should
when practicable be ploughed early in the
winter, that ih^y may by the ac ion of the
frost be reodered friable and more easy of
cultivator).
^r The usual and host method of planting
cotton is on ridges, the cent es of winch
vary in distance from three and a half to s<-v
en feet, in proportion as the soil is mare or
less fertile. The ridges being wiJeat upon
the more fertile so Is, where Irom the larger
siz-i to which this plant attains, it requires
the greater distance to admit the influence
of the sun and the circular on of the air.?
Upon all sods the observance of this rule is
important, hut part'icu! wly up n such as are
backward in bringing cot on to maturity, i
Tito ridges are formed according to circumstances
cither by the plough alone
drawn by one or more horses, or by the
plough and hoe.
The land being thus prepared, the object
IS to p'afit.
Cotton being proJuced in nil the Suothern
and Southwestern Slates, over a teiri'ory
embracing a considerable variety of climate,
is pia tted at d flerent times from the
middle of March to the firs: of May. As a
universal rule however, it may be remarked,
that the plant'T should select the earli st
perioJ that is consistent with safety. Confident
that let human systems vary as they

oeption, his labor will n*t bo in vain. In
the region embraced by tbe Pee L) *e Agricultural
Society, the best time for planting
w during the mon'h of April, commencing
about the second week and co npleting the
operation as soon a t rewards as practicable.
!t rarely, indeed it almost] never, occurs,
where lands have b?*en well prepared, tint
there is a failure in the a'and.
The seed are planted either in drills, in
^ cheeks or in chops. Hut the most usual
^ mid convenient me. hod when iced are
ahurid to', is to sow iri drdls run on the tops
of the ridges ami to cover lightly with a
plough constructed for the purpose. If the
weather is inmsf an I warm the plant will
appear in a fov days, if tli; contrary tbe
seed will rem * in for weeks without vegetating

injured by heavy floods of ram falling shortly

however, after the ctxton is up, is generally, u
in common language, "to chop out."
Ties operation is performed by drawing S
the hoo rapidly across the dnllat short in- 1
torva's, leaving be'ween each cho^three o^r- 1

The first ploughing it generally perform- w
ed with two furrows to the row, leaving a ol
narrow ridge of not more than six or eight ai
inch"S to bo work d bjrijtho line. In the ir
second ploughing the intorvnls between the ut
ridges should bo effectually ploughed^ out, in
and the Irosh earth thrown lightly around p<
the lower part of the cotton stalks. Every p
subsequent ploughing should be performed v
in the same manner, with an increasing par- t<
ncularity as tho plants increase in siz>? and t'

lest by so doing, th(' lateral rooif which are tc
thrown out in search of food, skould bo in- w
jured, an J the circulation of mm too J
much c hecked. Ploughs of various models
are used in effecting the a&me results,
but it is deemed unnecessary to enter into I
a description of them or' a description of p
their r? lutive adaptation to tho objects in- a
l wide I. Every planter in the seleoiion of t<
ploughs will of course bo governed by his c
own observation. n
The cotton crop should be worke I at in? rr
tervals of not more than ihiee weeks from It
the commencement to the termination of; ts o
cultivation, and sjccess depends not less upon
the judicious end skilful management of b
the hoe than of the plough. There is how- u
ever much greater uniformity in the moth- p
od of using this implement, and it may be I
remarked, in genera!, that where the noil is d
mellow and in good condition, it is sufficient ii
to remove tho grass where the plough can. tl
not reach it and to draw a 1 ttlo fn-sh e urib a
to t'ie plants with the hoe where the bods d
are hard; its province in addition, is to loos- I
en the surface. ti
With a view to the increase of produo. c
tiveness, many planters are in tho habit ol a
topping their cotton, and there is no doubt ii
that whore this operation is performed in h
time, i* produces good resul's. Tnc plant d
wh'?n upward growth is chocked by this i
process, yields more of its circulation to the r
j support of i s lateral branch.s and 10 the y
nourishinorit of its fruit. I

sary to allude to the great importance of i
having the coiion gathered as soon alter it c.

regard to (lie attention due toother in eresis
on a plantation. Every planter of obser- r
va.ion mils' be convinced of the great loss e
in weight, and the deterioration in quality, li
sustained by coton, from long exposure in ti
the fields to the storms and frosts of win- a
! ter. r
j Tne cot on plant is well known to he 1
subject to a great variety of diseases, some p
'oftliern appearing in the plant and otli rs i
! in the fruit only. Some have supposed that
! all of these diseases procee i from insects, p
M x >y of them no doubi do ; but rxperi. Ii
i ments have proved the existence of a cir- ?
culutory system in the vegetable us well as i
in the animal creation ; and it is known that, t
likeanimnU, vegetables ex'ract a fluid from \
whatever substances are applied to the or- p
gans through which they receive and digest c
their nuirimen*, that may either tend to pro- r
I mote their health or to produce disease.? (
Hence it is obvious that the health of vege- <
tables like that of animals may become in. ?
jurcd by drawing within their circulation i
deleterious or poisonous qualities, and that <
ili? ml nrifl oilier diseases in cotton r
may be attribu ed to this cause. This j

ontnbutrd more tlmn any others to that
usult, und for tlio present I will confine
lyself to those two. I mean planting
trgely to the hand, and the employment of
verseers.
I was somewhat surprised to find in a
ite number ol the "Agriculturist" that a
writer, under the title of Emigration, would
revent the evil by the very means, which
w illendeavor to show, will invariably prouee
it. It nas been the too fatal practice
ii Sou h-Carolina 4to ch ar and wear out'
l?? lands fit for cultivation. Plant twelve
,crrs of cotton, and eight of corn, pom oes,
?c. to the hand, as recommended by a Pine
^and Planter," and you will niosi certainly
lo the same thing. Plant seven acres ol
otton and five of provision?manure?rest
nd nurse your lauds, and they will always
mprovo under such management. You
re told to plant largely, and make a great
leal to the hand. I tell you to plant no
nore than you can tend \ery carefully, and
riake a great deal 10 ine acre, ana at length
ou v ill mike n great deal >o the hand too.
t is the system of planting largely to the
land which has so sadly impoverished the
ipper country of tnis State, is now wearing
>ut the lands in the West, Mill always pro.
lace the same results wlurever practised.
Cultivated lands must b> manured, or
nust have r?'St; which l itter is only a <JilF rnt
and t ettrr sys.em of manuring. I have
leard of lands winch do not require either,
>ul 1 ha tie not seen thein, and 1 know they
ire scan p. If manure or rest, or both, are
lecessary to ke* p lands from deteriorating,
will venture to assert that no one who
ilants very largely, can carry on thai sysein
to any profitable extent.
Let ni" compare the two systems. The
ilanter who cultivates twenty acres to each
land, must encounter great labor in (lie out*
iet to get that quantity of open land?be
nust make great use of the plough to tend
h it quantity, and keep up horse*?must
ilatil ot course u proportionate quantity of
irovision land, and as I maintain be cannot
dear fresh lands sufficient to enable him ;<j
est and refresh those which are wearing

piantity of land planted to produce an aver
i.?e crop?which crop gradually diminishes

:oines exhausted, until he abandons Ins
>lantution in dispuir, and the result is?euii
'ration.
I have not the least doubt on the othei
land, that twelve acres in cotton and corn
well tended, ono year witli another?wnl
jood and bad seasons, will produce as mucl
is twenty acres, carefully tended. Tin
*reat gun is, tliut under tho moderate sys
torn of planting eight of die twenty aero:

thereby in the end, so far from exhausting
it, will grea ly add to its value. The othc

p!?intation improves with each year. Fresh. V
ness and fertility is imparted to the soil, in
place of increasing barrenness and decay,
nnd the ever consoling reflection to the
planter thai he Qt least will not be compelled
to? migrate.
I am fully convinced that the system of
heavy planting Is extremely injurious to the
best interests of the planter, and of the State, '
nd 1 would greatly rejoice to see every
where in South-Caro'ina the adoption of a E
different svstem. To sec no more planted |
tnan the planter is always nl>!e to keep ^
clear of grass?to see at least one half of
the cotton lauds resting every year, and mn- n<
oure provided for the SJrn land-. - ; fjj
Another cause of our wajnt of success is ^
in th<- employment of overseers. I do not
wish to be understood us savins n word
at?uinst ;hat in luNtr oirs and useful class of ^
men, hut what I do mean is, that no planter '
can bo entirely successful who places the
whole management of his estate in the hands
m
of another.
1 will state th' overseer system, simply .
and plain y. Admit that a planter employs fj|
a good overser, who conducts Ins business y
generally, well enough, (always denying, ^
riowever, that tlie overseer can conduct it ^
better than the employer, if he has any good ^
habits of business.) Under such an over- i
seer, the plantation may be put and kept in f
good condition, but the usual result is that
the overseer d mands an increase of wages f)(
at the expiration of each year, until at
length the employer will give him no more,
and he seeks employment elsewhere. The y
planter gets another?a ban one?the chan- j
"*** an; aoainsi him, foi linddfefent or bad ^
overseers are more numerous than good ones
) The plantation becomes unprofitable
under his manageinen'?he in turn is re- ^
placed by another, and after a course of ^
years, under good, indifferent, and bad overseers,
the owner abandons a fine climate, f|'
and perhaps a fruitful soil, in the vain hop? ^
of finding elsewhere a country where his ^
labors will be rewarded ; but vain will be ^
his hopo-i if he continues always to trust ^
entirely to another, what he ought in great
part to do himself.
I; is a great bat loo common error of most
persons to suppose that any fool can make .
a good planter. Parents have often been ^
heard lo say?"I will give my son a plain ^
English Education?enough for a planter."
Give him enongh for a lawyer?a phvai- .
cian?a divine?acquaint him, if you can,
with all arts and studies," and he will make, p
I assure yon, no worse planter for his h am .
ing. The prevailing error that education ,j
is not necessary to the planter is a great j
cause of failure among that class of inen.
I am aware of no pursuit that requires more
continual observation and reflection than .
agriculture ; and 1 think that no one is likely
o be a very successfu' planter, unless he
so considers it. Agriculture,' says Marshal,
as quoted in the lute able address to n
the planters and farmers of South-Carolina. .
"is a subject which viewed in all its branch. 11
cs, und to ?heir fullest ex ent, is no: only the x'
most difficult in the rural economies, but in 1
tin-circle of human arts and science."
How then can the planti r he successful
who follows no fix-d plan himself, and en r
trusts the management of his entire esuiie v
j to the ever vaiying plans of his ngeirs. n
vvhom he changes with almost every year ; Let
me advisw each one to follow somesys- J1
tern?an erroneous one is belter than none '
at all. Never cult'vate more than his force n
is able to tend in any season, however ad- n
verse?rest?manure and nurse his lands v
?never entrust to another what he can and c
ought to do himself, and to him, I am sure, 1
the necessity of? m grating will never be pre- '
; hented. " COTTON. *
j Tlicro are two points in which wc consider j
I the views in the foregoing article erroneous. 1.
Too little prominence ? given to manuring.?
j Rest is important, if not necessary ; but inanur.
I tug* either by planting and turning iu green
! crops, or in some other way, is more so. 2. Tho
proscription of overseers is too general. On a
'urge plantation the proprietor cannot exorcise
a constant personal supervision over all its ope. ^
rations ; and if ho could, the labor and exposure (
would be too much for the majority ofottr plan- ,
ters. Tho fault most commonly committed seems {
t? us to be, not the employment of overseers, but ,
entrusting too much to them when they are cm- r
ployed The planter should be a planter, and j
direct all the operations on his plantation. lie |
should not suffer such management by any over- t
scor as to let his "plantation become unprofit- \

iMAiu. There is however, ample room j
ir the exerctse of much practiral good *
mse in poin'ing out the method of1
reeding, raising, breaking and working'
irming horses to the best advantage. The j
rofi'.s of agricultural operation generally
re modi-rate, and managed as tltey are in
lany ins unres loss is incurred. Most

but a very inadequate compensat on !

ended, li ought not to be. and thai it is .
oes not result necessarily, but from the
ant of proper care and judgment in breed, j

hat they know a horse is a horse and a ;
leer a st?*er, und that if iho coit was got for J
barrel of corn and the calf gratis, that they i
ave saved their money.
The business of breeding animals, in mo- j
cm times, is sa d to be science. It has I
ot been, liowev* r, arid probably never will j
>c reduced to exactness. * Dame nature" |
a her operations delights to display endless '
arieties. But certain Yules have been laid j
lown by the observance of which we may j
e.'Sonahly expect to approximate certainty. |
1 Like begets like" is the leading rule. It j
tot only has its exceptions, but it must be j
inderstood with limitation. Soled a horse j
nd a mare, such as you want, or as near j
s you can find, the produce of their con- 1
jnction may resemble the sire, or the
lam, or neither ; hut it may have an infernediute
form, or may take after some re- j
note ances'or ; and if the remote ancestors !
vere indifferent, or positively bad, t!ie {
fiances will he against the rule, in propor. j
ion to the number of worthy progenitors. |
t should be enjoined on beginners, therefore,'
st, To s' lect good animals to start upon,
vhere no better evidence cun be had : 2udly,
fut where it can, to select them from good
arnili''s. In England, where more a tenion
has been paid to the breeding and rearng
the blood horse, than in any other counrv,
ilu y have arrived at extraordinary size,
>n<l power and endurance ; and it has been
lone by combining the A rab, Barb and T urk,
ind developing the bone and muscle of
he new race by generous feed and judicious
xerc'se. There no one thinks of breeding
i rac- r from o mare who lias not at least
ivc pure crosses. And many of their mosi
listinguished marcs can number double the

su.ted to a particular purpose is to bo
produced by considering the I pro per ties, ^
wanted, and the families and individuals
from which such properties are most likely
to be inherited. Were the thorough breeds
equally numerous, and bred and ra sed at
the same or nearly the some cost, I would
say without hesitation, and so would every
one who understands his interest, put tho
thorough bredsto work. Eclipse, or Until
r, or Tranby, or Mingo, or Job, if put to
it in their prime, would have done more
work than any inferior bred horses ofiheir
size. In June or July, blood will tell as
promptly in the corn field as on the race
course. My best breds always then tuko

hope, hat some individuals or companies or
agricultural societies would import a bay
Turk, a bay Barb and a Cleavelund bay,

of bay color and universally gentle in harness.

the north, apparently half brcds, excellent <
in harness, of the desire d size and shape.

might be had in Virginia or Pennsylvania. j
T lie s'ock should all be selected by a com- i
petent ju Igc of horse flesh, and the two I
coarser kinds should be chosen not only >y
with a view to thcirown s outness, but fum;- ^
ly stoutness and gentleness at work, and
with a scrutinizing eye to their hoofs and
pasterns. Brittle horn, gummy ankles, or
tendency to grease in the heals should be
on insurmountable objection to a horse
however perfect in other respects. Wr?
would of course have to choose the temper
of the B ubs and Turks, though a man
thoroughly conversant with horses can from
certain indications form a tolerably correct
estimate of their tempers. A person but
moderately acquainted would be able to
know that Bclshazzur was quiet, and that
St. Giles was " queer." The marcs to bo
selected, shouIJ be well bred, of bay or
brown colour and n few greys. They
should have long heads, wide between the
eyes, and jaws well displayed, with clear
placid eyes, and open foreheads, with pointed,
w? II set ears, and finq muzzles, and nostrils ;
necks of moderate length and muscular,
with large detached windpipes; having
quarters before and behind with plenty of
muscle ; large bodies with Inrge ribs, and
the short ribs closo to the hips; standing
even and rather wide on legs abounding ia
hone and sinew, and terminated bv tough
black hoofs. A white pastern and In.of is
about as liable to disease as those of blac^c
