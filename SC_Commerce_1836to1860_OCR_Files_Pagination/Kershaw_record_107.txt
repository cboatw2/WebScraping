THE subscriber informs the public, (hat he hsa
just completed the mixture of this valuable medicine.
He takes pleasure in stating that he boa
made use of this PANACEA, successfully in a case
of Scrofula, which he has been afflicted with more
than three years. On several occasions he applied
to practical Physicians for aid, (North and South,)
and received no benefit. He was, at length, prevailed
upon by numerous acquaintances, to try tho
virtue of certain ROOTS and HERBS; and believing,
that the Receipt would greatly benofit him,
he took it, together with an old French Receipt: from
wnicn id manufactured mo v rni^A CEA.
It id proper hero to say, that the quality of some,
or alt. the principal Roots, are well known to the
Medical Faculty, by whom thejr are frequently used.
For Scrofula or King'* Evil, Ulcerated Sores,
Knoral diseases of tbo BLOOD, of tho effects of
ercury ; it has a decided salutary eflbef.
For boirst Complaint he would also recommend
the o-e of the VEGETABLE PANACEA. Children
are frequently attacked with this complaint:
especially when teething. A few doses ol the PANACEA
will check the Bowels, and they become regular
again. It has been tried by a great number of
respectable individuals, and pronounced a " certain
cure." He has tried it at different times in his own
family, and it relieved the child immediately.
This Medicine is simple in its operations; and han
a pleasant taste.
Give it a trial, and judge its worth.
The subscriber will keep a constant supply of the
Panacea at the different Drug Stores throughout

Camden Commercial Courier.
THE Establishment of the COMMERCIAL
COURIER was rendered necessary by the inconvenience
to which our citizens have been subjected
for the want of a public channel of communication
which in a commercial community like Camden, is
essentially necessary, and consequently the COURIER
S claim on the public is such as should ensure
a liberal patronage.
The undersigned have spared no trouble or expense
in obtaining the best workmen in order to
render the Paper all the advantages that it will
admit of, and affording satisfaction to its patrons.
In political matters the Courier will take no
part; the design being to publish a Paper adapted
to the interest of am., which could not be effected
by its entering into the arena of Politics?it will
be confined principally to such matter as appertains
to Commerce, Agriculture and Amusement.
The COURIER is published every Saturday
morning at Three Dollars in advance, or Four
Dollars if not paid until the expiration of the year.

I From the general embarrassment of the times ;

out of their immediate circles of issue, we have j
been solicited by agents and Venders to postpone j

We have therefore yielded to these solicitations,

of September next, when the drawing will positively
take place.
Adventurers having purchased tickets in said

THE success of the SOUTHERN TONIC is'
unprecedented. It has been anxiously sought
after by all persons in every part of the United
States, and its widely extended distribution has
been owing to the many requests received from
every section of the South and South West. Although
it originated in an obscure purt of the country
but a few years since, it is now found in all the
principal towns and villages in the Union, and its
virtues as a cure ibr Ague and Fever, and as a
general Tonic, are apprec ated by all who have
used it Being as it professes a compound of
Southern Vegetables, it is needless to offer the as-.
suranee that there is no Arsenic,Mercury, nor any
tiling in the least hurtful to the human constitution
in it. It will be found a valuable Medicine
in all cases of Dyspepsia and disorganised Stomach
and Bowefsl and patients convalescing from Ril- j
lions Fever, will derive the most important bene- !
fits from the use of the Southern Tonic. It may '
be administered to children and infants of the most
tender age with the utmost safety. Prepared by

JONES'
PATENT COTTON GIN.
rW\HISGin can be made double, or single. If
* made double, they reduce labor, and gin just
double, the quantity of cotton over the single cylinder
Gin, no other knd having been in use prevous
to this patent; and whether single or double, they
are found to improve the quality of the cotton, by
more perfectly cleaning it. They can be made to
contain from 20 to 160 saws in a stand, and whether
small or large, one hand will be sufficient to attend
them. The Gins have mechanical feeders and
hoppers attached to them, which free the cotton
from leaves, trash, dirt, &c. before it can reach the
saws,-and by the thorough hackling operation it
f lm fnndn rr teltiolt molra 4 mm
it'Wl ivco iiuiii nit* iti utio, ?? iiivii inanc iwu irvu" i
lutions to one of the saws, it is almost in a half
gined state, before it descends to the saw By a
very simple arrangement of a screw to each set ol
gaates, on which the hoppers rest, aod through
which the teeth of the feeders pass, they can be
made to Jeed slow or fast to suit the condition of
the cotton at the time. When made double, the
saws are placed on two sets of C3'linders and turn
upon each other in opposite directions, and are
cleansed by two seta ol brushes that have four revolutions
to one of twe saw. The two cylinders can
be detached so as to enable the planter to run one
or both at pleasure, although embraced with feeders.
&c. in one stand. The whole is put in operation
w ith a drum and band, as in the ordinary Gin, and
may be propelled by horse, steam, or water power.
It may also be propelled by iron running gear.
The torce required to work it, is about the same as
that necessary to move an equal number of saws in
the common Gin. This Gin has been put in :
operation in New Orleans lor two or three weeks, !
and its success tested in the presence of a large !
number of planters, merchants and others, and
received their general approbation.
Several gentlemen have been so kind as to give
the Patentee their written opinion respecting the
merits of the Gin. A number of others could be
added, but the following are deemed sufficient:
From his Excellency Gov. While of Louisiana.
New Orleans, Feb. 27, le37.
Dr. A. Jones?Sir, in reply to your enquiry,
what I think of your improved Cotton Gin, I have
to say, that I saw it work on Saturday the 25lh inst.
and was very much plensed with its perlormance.
The mere fact of its self-feeding, seems to me to
be a very \aluable improvement; and besides, the
quality ot Ihc cotton, as it comes out ot the process,
appeared to me to be belter and cleaner than
from the common Gins in use, and that it saves
considerably in labor. Respectfully, Ac.
E. D. WHITE.
From Mr J. Compton, a wealthy planter, resident
in the Parish of Rapide, Louisiana.
Dr. Jones?Dear Sir, 1 have examined your Patent
Cotton Gin, with feeders, Ac. And have
seen it in operation, and approve of it so highly,
that I have taken the liberty of ordering one lor
rfly plantation in time for the next crop.
Yours respectfully, J. COMPTON.
New Orleans, Feb. 28, 1837.
From Mr. A. Longer, an experienced and eminent
Cotton Broker of New Orleans.
New Orleans, *eb. 28,1837.
Dr. Jones ?Dear Sir, in answer to your note of
this morning, 1 will state, that 1 have carefully examined
your new Patent Cotton Gin, and have

M'Kenna & Wright, of New Orleans. ,
Dr. A. Jones?Dear Sir, in reply to your ncte,
accompanied by a specimen of the cotton, ginned
by your Patent Gin, 1 beg leave to observe, that it
exhibits a drcidi d improvement on the usual process
of ginning ; delivering the staple uninjured
and free from nap or trash, clean ar.d of good co<*
lor ; thereby giving the article on additional value.
These favorable impressions of the advantages of
your Patent Gin, have been confirmed by subsequently
witnessing it in operation. The utility of
the double cylinders and saving of labor, will be
readily perceived and properly appreciated by the
intelligent planter.
Feeling a deep interest in the success of all improvements
tending to benefit the important staples
of our country, 1 trust that yours will meet with
the encouragement it justly merits.

From Mr. G. Senior, a Machinist of New Orleano.
Dr. A Jones?Dear Sir, in onswet tc your inquiry
of my opinion of your Patent Cotton Gin, 1
beg leave to slate, that 1 was fifteen years engaged
in the cotton factories of Manchester, Eng
r i ?i J? ? r - -
uiiu, uiiu uuruig lour j-rars of that time, I was
foreman in the home of Messrs. Lewis, Williams
Co., and near five years spinner in the house of
M essrs. Sandford & Greene. 1 have seen ycur
Cotton Gin in operation, and have examined the
cotton ginned by it, and pronounce it bettor cleansed,
and the sluple less injured, than any cotton
that ever came under my observation. It is completely
reai!y lor the breaker without the aid of the
blower, and would, therefore, save the first process
in manufacturing the article. I consider cottcn
cleansed by your Gin, would command from ere
to two cents on the pound more than the average
crops brought into the Manchester market, and
cleansed by common Gins. Vours, very xesp'lv.
IS. Orleans, March 9, GEORGE SENIOR."
Dr. Jones?Denr Sir, in answer to your inquiry
respecting my opinion of your Latent Cotton Gin,
1 have to state, that 1 have been engaged in put
ting up the Carver C> ins for planters on Red River
and that I have seen your Gin in operation, and
hove examined the quality of the cotton produced
by it; I consider it equal il not superior to the Carver
Gins: in addition to which, 1 think your feeders
a decided improvement, and by the aid ot*
which, the quality of the cotton cleansed appears
much improved, over that produced by the com
nion um?. lours &c. S. BENNETT

The Gins ordered will be delivered to the agenda
of planters in any of the sea port towns of the cotton
planting States, at the above prices, the agents
paying the freight on the same from New York,

It is desirable, when planters givebrders for Gioe,
they should accompany them with their views in
regard to the arrangement of saws, breasts, brushes,
Arc. it is found they diflcr in opinion. Son:?
desire saws of larger diameter than others. To?
most common size is 9 or 10 inches; but 6ome wish
them 12 inches borne wish 5 or (i rows of brushed
on an axle, while others do not want more than 4
at most. Some wish saw s with 8 or 9 teeth to tho
inch, while others want 10 cr II. With so much
discrepancy, we prefer they should, at the time of
giving orders, furnish a statement of their wishes,
and the manufacturerers can fulfil them in every
particular. wnere n is icn u? ?'?i uin h hvi.,
shall make tlirm 011 the most modern and approved
plan. An order con be executed, from the time it
is ree.eived, in the space of eight or nine weeks,
and the Gin in that time phced in the hands of tho
fae.tor. To be in time for the next crop, all orders
ought to be in the handt of the manufacturers by
the first or middle of May ; except for plantations
where they are late in commencing to pick or gin
cotton.
