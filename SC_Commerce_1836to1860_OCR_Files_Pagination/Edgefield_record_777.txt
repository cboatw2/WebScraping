Friday Evening. May 25. 143. .
Sir, -A conflagration commenced in
'his place at about rour o'clock this moru
ins, and at this present writing (9 o'clock)
the greater partof the-town is in ruins.
.Every business house in the place has
been destroyed, and with them the post
office. I succeeded ii saving the contents
of the ofice but everything is i6 such a
state of confusion, that it is imposiible -to
assort the mail that should leave on to
morrow morning. The fire is now appa.
reny subdued, or rather has exhausted
itself, by tije-lestruction of everything it
coold reach, and no ianger of i:s spread
ing further is apprehended. If suitable
aconmmodatioos can be obtained, a mail.
.will be despatched on Sunday morning.

The Savannah Republican of the same
dute contained these addIiinal particulars.
"We have beetn-fvored by W-n. Dag
gett, Esq., who arrived in town last eve
ning from Tallahassee, with some further
particulars which we annex. The fire
war it discovered in the hock buildings
of the Wastrogio-iHall, which was burnt.
This build6i was sitoatel near thespi.
t)l, and the fire extended on both sides of
Main street. to the Court House. Every
store in the city was destroyed. Of the
three printing offices o. Was save-thae
of the Star, the Sentinel and the Floridian.
ofices, were liurned.
"It is supposed that there were at least
two hundred and fifty buildings with most
of their contents destroyed. It was im
possib'-e to save many of the goods In the
stores, thefire made such rapid progress,
and toie that were saved were mostly in
a dafsged state. Sevearal buildings were
blown up, and two or three negroes lost
their lives.
"The loss is estimated at $300.000.
There had been no rain for six weeks, in
consequence of which -the buildings had
become so dry that thay burnt like tinder."
The Hail Storn in St. John's antd St.
Stepha's.-The destructiveness of this
calamitous visitation, it will be seen by the.
sujoined letter, was cren greater :han at
first reported-it has swept with blasting
fury over the entire region from the Eutaw
Springs to Pineville, embracin many of
the finest and most puddecive, lng staple
cotton plantations'in the State-the deso
lation cannot have ranged over less than
41000 acres of cotton alone, besides the
damages to crops of other descriptions.
Locn DU, May 31.
I avail myself of an opportunity to write
you again a few hasty lines ton'cig the
late hail storm. .it is the fibishing stroke
of desiraction to the long cotton of most of
Upper Si. John's and St. Stephen's.-Con
sidering the area it has traversed, and the
inur it has committed, it is perhaps un
paiareled, either within imy recnllection
or by any thing I havo ever heard of in the
nattire otf a hail storm. Aly letters to yon
on the subjec:. wiJZ4'o you riu:'s faint
idea of its desolating violence. iWe have
beard with certainty of its ravages from
the Eutaw Springs to .-Pineville-how
mtuch farther we do not know. 4,write
with regret of the destruction of fully one
half of the crop at ant -Pleasant, and
of nearly one. third -of my own-with the
residno of- bdth c-ps severely injured,
