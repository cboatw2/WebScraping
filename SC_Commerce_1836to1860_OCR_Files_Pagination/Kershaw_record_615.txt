Washington, Dec. 20.
.In Senate, this morniug, Abolition petitions
tvere presented from Pennsylvania and Vermont.
The motion to rcceiveAvas- laid upon the
table.
Mr. Huntington, from the Committee on
Commerce, repotted the lull to. .increase the
pay of officers of revenue cutters while employed
in the naval Bcrvice, with an amendment.
Mr. Calhoun gave notice of his intention to
? introduce a bill for the relief of the heirs of
. John D<? Trevillc. .
Mr. Liinn, m pursuance to notice, ininxmceu
a bill to repeal the distribution sections of tlie
bill passed at the last session, for the distribution
of the proceeds of the public lands among
the States, and to pledge them.to tlie public de?
fence. He moved that the'bill he referred to
the Committee on Military Affairs. .This motion
gave rise to a very interesting debate, in
which Messrs. Linn, Smith, of Ia-Y Calhoun,
Pierce, Allen, Buchanan and Preston, participated.
Mr. Linn then withdreiy. Iiis motion, .and
adopted an amendment offered by Mr. Calhoun
to refer it to a Select Committee of seven.
It was further debated by Messrs. Calhoun,
Mangum, King^ Barrow, Woodbury, Rives,
Lien, Archer aud Prentiss, wheu the motion to
refer to a Select Committeei was. negatived?
Ayes 17, Noes" 24.. The question was then
t&Ken on referring it at au, .wnicn was aisu 1
negatived?Ayes 18. NoeB 25. It therefore
goes on the orders, and was made the special ;
order for debate, Mr. Calhoun referred, evident- ,
ly with much pride and satisfaction, to the ac- .
tion of South Carolina in relation to the D.istri- <
bution Bill. I
Mr. Preston acknowledged that his views on '
the subject had undergone a material change? ?
he feared that the policy which dictated it was
an unwise one, ana the sooner we retraced our ?
teps the better. - (
Mr. Mangum remarked, that not a single ]
measure of retrenchment had been recommend- t
ed by the head of any department, but .he i
hoped the party who had the majority in both j
Houses, and who would be held responsible by
the country, would show themselves willing to <
meet tha^responsibilily as they ought to do. j J
The Senate remained in session until near 4 i
o'clock. a
In the House,- a Resolution "Was offered to in- a
struct the Committee, on the Post Offices, to f
^bring in a bill to Abolish the franking privilege of e
^ members of-Congress, to conform the rates of r
"postage to the different denominations of United v
States coin, "and to increase the postage on o
printed sheets over a certain weight This was 1
declared to be out of orde. d
The Tariff debate was then resumed,-and Mr.' t
Sollers, of Md/addressed the House in favor of ii
the protective policy, provided'the' manufacturers
would take the tobacco interest under their t
protection, by laying countervailing dyties. He tl
was follpwed by Mr. Linn, who advocated the b
same reference, but from a different cause. He C
considered it a contest between free labor and j<
slave labor, and be -never would consent to t<
place the latter on an equality with the--former. a
Mr. Rhett asked if a Southern member Had ti
ever made the issue between slave labor and free p
labor as suggested by him. ~ ii
^ Mr. Linn said, it was the .result of the argu**
merits usedby Southern gentlemen. 1
He was* ably replied , to by Mr. -Rayner, of ii

Correspondence of the Charleston Courier.." ?
. Washington, Dec. 23. "
The report in explanation and defence of the e
President's plan of finance, is stated, in the 't?
Madisonian, to be a cabinet paper... Indeed, We \\
know that it was under consideration^ the cabi- t(
net It is also probable that each cabinet officer j
contributed his views in the general consultation; ^
but, still, 'it is evident from the style, that' the :
saner was written bv Mr. Webster. It is a 11
masterly work, aa every one admits; and those n
who maybe in favor of doing something in aid of
the currency and exchangee, and may be con- ii
vinced that this is the .practicable scheme, will j",
weigh it well, before they take the responsibility t
of utterly rejecting it Ii is impossible to say,
however, from present appearances, what will
x be the fate of the measure. -
The Senate has, to-day, passed Mr. Preston's 11
resolution for a joint Committee to superintend a
the placing of Washington's statue m-the rotundo
and ajso-tllb ^xQcution of the details .of fi
the pedestal. v
> The I|ou8e #ill adopt the resolution/ and, v
thus, theyjtatue will haveVa fair chance for exhibition
and due appreciation; "That it is now ,
in a very disadvantageous light, is universally' "
admitted.; Mr. Preston, you bvill see, bears' v
very strafog testimony to the sublimity and beau- c
ty of thiework. ' ' J
Mr. Fillmore, to-day, reported a bill from t
the Committee on Ways and-MeanB, to extend j.
.v, the timqfof the twelve million loan,, and to add
five miflions to its amoynt. By this measure *
and scjme adjustment of the tariff, it iB proposed (
to supply the deficit in the revenue for .the year
1842. i
'the Hoy Be resumdd the reconsideration of I
the resolution "to refer to the Committee on Jj
.Manufactures that p^rt of the President's Mes- (
/ sage which relates to the tariff. The debate on j
this question does $ot necessarily involve any
very important considerations?tfor the most that '
committees can do is to mature plans for the ,
consideratfon of thi House?and,-if there should >
be one plan from the Manufactures and-another i
irom the Ways imd Means, it would be of- no
( embarrassment to the House.. But, the' bcca.- (
sion is a suitable one to present, in advance of ,
the action of the committees, the . views of the (
memoers on me Buojecia oi me tarin ana me
revenue. - 1
Mr. Atherton spoke, to-day, in favor of the
reference to the Ways and Means, and "in de- I
fence Of the late administration from the charge
of extravagance. At the same time, he accused "j
the present whig administration of wistful and ,
corrupt extravagance. Mr. Arnold, of Tennessee,
denied that the present was a uliig administration;
aiid denounced John-Tyler, as a worse
locofoco than' Martin Van Iluren.
Mr. Reynolds, of Illinois, spoke in support
of the free trade doctrines; aud passed trom
that subject, to the war against China and other
proofs of the intention of England to extend,
her dominion over the world. Mr. Adams will
have to take up tlse glove thus thrown down for
)iim. ' * "
Both Houses adjourned' ovct* t'o Monday next.
Washington, Dec. 28,
No eff rt was made in the House, to-day, to
^ check the tariff debate, though Mr. Fillmore
f lit w -
V '' " <^y '* *** ' '
?j- ;^V. -,. ''jiZ&pT,
hail informed the members that th& Treasw
must remain, literally, not comparatively, emi
tv, until they passed his loan bill. The object <
that bill is to extend the loan heretofore autho:
ized, to eight years, so as to induce capitaliei
to take it and to increase the sum from twelv
to seventeon millions. Meanwhile, the men
bors remain unpaid. The House requisition ft
825,000, sent yesterday morning, in order 1
obtain nioncy for the pay of members, die, ws

Treasury, it is cieaneu oui, uuu were id uuu
ing. coming in. The new revenue act of la?
pesason will add nothing to the revenue at pre
sent, becausethe country is stocksd ivith tlj
dutiable goods.
It was expected that^ Mr. Preston would, thi
day, briug forward his motion to refer the Pres
dent's plan of finance to a Select Committee, an
a very brilliant debate was looked for. It wa
arranged that Mr. Buchanan should let d offth
attack upon the plan, on the part of the demc
critic party, and he followed by 6ome of the prir
cipal whigs." Strange as it may seem, itjs nev
ertheless true?as I have ascertained?that ther
is but one Senator who will support Mr. Tyler'
plan in its present-form, and tnat Senator is Mi
Tallmadge! -So, the administration is in
minority of one in the Senate!,^ fact unparallei
ed before in our history. ,
Under these circumstances how can it be ex
pected that the Select Committee in the Hous
will venture to report the plan at all? I hard!
think they will make any report at all?but i
they make any, they will offer a plan stripped c
jxchanges.and of the certificates of deposite
find reduced, as near as possible to the con
lerandd sub-treasury-^in the vain -hope of ob
aining the support- of the democratic party.?
Fhe subject did not come up to-day, lidtyevei
is another debate occupied the day.1.may
he t mention that Mr. Clay, who isin thi
Senate to-day, has recovered from his recent in
lisposition, and intends, after a few days, or a
east, as early as convenient, to offer- resalutioni
o carry, out the. prirfciples of the whig caucui
nanifeito, in respect to the abolition of the veil
rower. V':. ' Y?'? " '
A motion was' made, .to-day, to refer to the
2oramiitee on the Judiciary, the bill of Mr
Jenton to postpone the operation of, the Bankapt
Bill till July' next, for. the. purpose o:
unending it It was contended by.Mr Mangurr
md Mr. Buchanan that the law, in its present
orin, was impracticable and conld never be exicuted.
The District Courts of the ,U. S. could
lot, in twenty years, dispose of the cases thai
vouid arise, under the act the first week of its
peration. Moreover, it was contended that the
aw was passed in a.hurry?was defective in its
etails in many respects?and must be essenially
modified, if not repealed. -Public opinion,
I wis said, wouid justify its repeal.
Mr.,Clay,"Mr. Tallmadge, and Mr. Hender,
ion took very different views. They regarded
he law as popular, as necessary, and called for
y the public voice. That the ..force of the
'ourta was inadequate to execute it was. no ob;ction
to it?it was the duty of the government
j render it it practicable. Let the law,- they
aid,.go into operation, and the judicial authorises
will soon let us kpow where it may be imerfectand
need amendtneuu Tho Senate reused
to refer the bill.
The House did nothing but to debate the

ST. AUGUSTINE, Dec. 34.
I-. ^ The Mandarin Massacre.?Thus reads this !
- horrid tragedy so far as we can learn it: I
i On Friday last, (or ail few days previous,) a
! party of 21 Indian warriors came into the neighI;
borhood of the Mandarin settlement, which is
situated on the east bank of the St Johns, 28
* miles north-west of this city, and 15 miles above
Jacksonville.
After feconnoitering the varibua plantations,
they:on Monday afternoon cangbt a-negro belonging
to Mr. Wm. Hartley, who wadroutBqairrelhuntiqg,
at anTevening, proceeded towards the
settlement for the'purpose of plundering the
store, but as- the negro told them, that there
were many menJn that^ diroctipn, they turned
back to the Hartley neighbotMfcxVWmrh-ta -tun*
Julington creek and about four, miles- ffom the
St. Johns, and from/which they had seen the
men depart, who werd gone on a hunting party
of two days. ,

They then proceeded to the other plantations,
-while theialarroed inhabtants maMged to escape J
from their'houses, as though by a miracle. The
houBes of Nathaniel,' "and George Hartley were :
successively visited, plundered, and;: burned,
with the-out buildings?they then returned, to,
the house of Wm. JJartley, which they also \
plundered, andiifed; the bodies of his wife andchild,
and, of Mr. Acosta were consumed.
The fhdiahs^still detaining the negro as a prisoner,
next proceeded to a division of the pluq,
