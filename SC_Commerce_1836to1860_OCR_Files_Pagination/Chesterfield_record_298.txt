tank circulation to iis proper limits. To 1
'suppose, as multitudes vainly do, that it is \
within the compass of human power to re- I
lieve the embarrassed, by making money i
plenty, and by the same agency, to reform i
the currency, hy making it scarce, is to I
suppose a miracle, such as divine power has I
never performed.
It is very remote from my intention'
therefore, to do anv thing to promote the
interest of mere speculators in bank charters,
or in any thing else ; my views are of
u more howly and practical kind, looking ,
to the restoration of our trade, to its ancient .
channels. In this view, the encouragement
of our importing merchants, is a matter of ]
vital interest at the present moment ; and I
know of nothing that would place it more
Completely in the power of our banks to
afford that enCouragemen', than the plan
proposed.?Having always a supply of sterling
exchange, they would bo enabled to
I ... .
meet the wants or our importing mercnanis ;
and having in like manner a large credit in
Europe, they would he at all times able to
cive these merchants a credit there, better
tor them than bills of exchange.
Indeed, our Banks having the control of
the foreign exchange, would, by that means,
acquire the control of the domestic also, and
and the exchange between the Nortlt and
the South would be equal zed, orturuod in
our favor.
After ibis brie exposition of tbo proposed
plan of restoring the cotton trade to its n:?-j
tural channels, 1 willnoiicea few of the objections
urged against it.
A great apprehension is expressed, that
this movement on our side, will produce
counter-combinations on the other. Most
assuredly, the charges made against tlie
* Circul <r,M and the tone of the articles published
in some of our journals, arc calculate
lo encourage and invite such combinations.
Ther charge upon us hostile and
offensive co nib ma'ions, when we propose
only to assume a defensive position, to resist
such combinations abroad, and to avoid
the necessity of glutting the markets in moments
of panic or temporary and unnatural
depression. They proclaim our weakness,
and exaggerate the power of the adversary,
as much as to say to the European manufacturers,
now notoriously combined to
force down ihc price of the cotton, in the
face of the mosi deficient crop ever made,
u go on?gentlemen, regal ite the price of
c tton as you pleuS", any etfort made to re.
s;st you by the poor, dispersed planters,
will be impotent and rediculous," If there
be either nationality pa'riotisin, or truth in
these statements and sentiments, it escapes
my perception. If it were to come to a
war of combinations, winch God forbid, it
is utterly untruo, that we should be powerless
in such a contest. .We possess the
locks of Sampson. Our co;ton is absolute,
ly indispensable to the manufactur ng and
commercial nations of Europe, and by w itliholdmg
a single crop, we could spread star
vation and rebellion over 1110 mauuuu uung
portions of Europe, uncJ cause the lordly
capitalists, so much dreaded, tocry out for
quarters. A pretty sory to proclaim!
abroad, that the producers of our annua! export
of 830,0u0,000 of a staple, admitted to
be equal to so much bullion?a staple too,
which sustains nearly one half of the entire
commerce of England, are too impotent to
. guard their own interests. If witu such
resources,-our planters hive been feeble, because,
os your correspondent justly says,
they are widely dispersed?it is the very
reason why they should assemble together,
to dovise the means ofcontroiling their own
prop?riy, which ev-'.y body else Ins he m
too long in the habit of controllings and us ng
for their own purposes.
As to combinations abroad, they exist
already, and have recen' ly carried their j
power to the utmost stretch. They have
bad to give way, and a re-act ion is already
commenced, fho idea that other cotton
countries w il rival and supplant us, is utter- ,
ly visionary, i said to un intelligent mer ,
chant of London, intimately acquainted w ill)
the East India trade,44 how is it that Eng.
, land bus never been able to obtain a larger
supply of cotton from her East India pos-!
sessions ?" Ho replied,44 the difference of !
freight alone, to say nothing ofother causes,
is sufficient to account for it."
But the combination of slave labor, with
highly intelligent proprietors, present, to direct
their operations?a combination which
exists no where else iu the world, is the great
and sufficient cause of that superiority iu
our cotton planting, which will forever defy
all competition, until fanaticism shall reduce
us to tiie condition of S . Domingo
and Jamaica. 1 will notice but one or two
more objections.
One writer exclaims 44 let trade alone, to
regulate itself V' and another is so very absurd,
as to consiJcr this effort of the planters
to place their property out of the reach
. of foreign combinations, by preventing its
accumulation in the hands of speculators,
without capital as a gross violation of the
principles of free trade ! Vur-ly, these are
new lights shed upon the world ! Because,
forsooth, the planters choose to select
ll? rir own agents, their own manner, and
their own time for bringing their cotton to
market, a tremendous hubbub is for;hwith
. raised, as if the pillars of the constitution
were abou: to be torn down. The planteis.
quiet and dispersed as they are, have boon
ro loner and so habitually sheared, that those
wiio have enjoyed the golden fleece, seem )
now to regard it a# a vested right, ft is
high time to brf?k the illusion of this prescriptive
right, nnd teach ail such, that if the
planters have been picked and fleeced,
they are neither gease nor sheep. And if
tiny class in our Southern communities
choose to take sides against us, and even
become the advocates of the foreign manufac
urers, as the extraordinary course or
some of our journals on the sea const and
the Gulpb, would almost warrant us in suspecting?ihey
must be taught that the plan- 1
ters constitute the first estate in the empire
of Southern commerce, and are not to be
driven, or flattered wheedM, from their just 1
purposes, by the combined forces of speculators
and editors.
J trust, th?rcfor?, that the proposed Con.
mention will assemble at Macon, and that the i
planters a', least, will be fully represented, by i
ihe very ablest men tltey can select. It is i
no ordinary occasion, but, far more impor- .*
lant to the South and South*-West, than all <
the presidential Conventions ever brought !
together. <

From the Fjrmere' Cabinet.
Cows vs. Horses*
[laving read a communication in the last
number of the Cabinet signed H., on the
cost of keeping nn idle horse," f found the
sum of sixty dollars as there set down, quite
wiihin the mark ; and I should not knew
how to accomplish it for that sum hy a long
slice ; and if H. was to take shoeing and
liability to contingencies into the account,
it would considerably swell the aggregate
account. On examining the subject and
looking a little further into it, I find that the
cost of keeping 14 one i lie horse," will keep
two milch cows comfortably, and that each
cow during the year will produce, (including
a calf) a cloar gain of thirty dollars
without any straning of the point whatever.
This makes sixty dollars per annum profit
from the two cows, which added to tho sixty
dollars loss sustained by keeping " an idle
horse," instead ofthe cows, nt tiio same cost,
makes a d.fference of one hundred and
. * -- J " .? ..Ant* r\r ftj|? intJTHSt oftWO'
I WOmy UUilura a T^u>i "I
thousand dollars for on? year, oud so on
from year to year as long as the
error is persisted in. I knew a very worthy,
industrious, careful firmer, about fifty
years ago, who had a snug farm and ev< ry
thing apparently in good order about him,
but he did'nt tlnive; wiien he died, it was
found he was not out of debt; and his estate
was altogether much less than was expectc
I. I tried in vain to acconnt for it, but
was unable to do so till, after this long lapse
of time ; but now I can see through it, and
understand it thoroughly, ! remember, he
kept about a dozen horses, on a farm of
ubout 100 acres, and he kept them well, too ;
sleek, clean nice and well fed ; for he was
fond of horses, and fine or.es too, though he
was no sportsman. FI s horse stable was
twice as largo as his cow stable. The
coivs wore about six in number, if my mem.
ory serves right, at this long dis'ance of
lime. Now four or five horses would have
beca nil.sufficient for his necessary purpoes,
and all over this number was surplusage,
as the lawyers say ; say seven above'
the right numU'r, which would represent, in
the expense of keep, fourteen cows. As
butter in those days only sold for about half
as much as it does in these latter times, 1
put the profit of each cow (including the
calf, at one half, say fifteen dollars a year,
and fifteen times fourteen is two hundred
and ten dollars a year, loss sustained by
keeping seven horses instead of fourteen
cows.
Now our schoolmaster, who is good at
calculation, says, shut an annual sum of 210
dollars put to interest at 6 per cent., and a
tike sum tt> k ? ?ch year, and the in.,
terest accruing annually being put out to interest,
that in ten years it will amount to$2,
707 90?and that in 20 years it will be $7,.
724 97?in 25 yars, $12 070 19?in 3d :
years, $10,602 21?in 40 year <, $32,5000
01.
Now this shows very plainly why the old
man died in debt, instead of leaving a good
farm for each of his children. It is just as
plain to me now, as that grass grows ;
though for a long series of years it was quite
inexplicable, notwithstanding I had oft-ai
thought of it, and tried to solve the mystery;
but i now see 1 always went in ihe wrong
seen', and when you do thai you will never
catch the game, I now am confirmed in
the conclusion that whatever we understand
is easy, ?nd that whatever we don't understand
is difficult and mysterious. The old
man was all his life travelling oil the wrong
rack, to arrive ut independence and weal'h,
and 1 now see many going the same roud
on horseb ?ck, and there can't be a doubt but
fhcy will come out at the same place witn
the old farmer alluded to ; for like causes
always produce the same effect under similar
circumstance. Some of the old folks
who are your readers, will very likely be desirous
of knowing who the old farmer was
that kept so many horses and so few cows.
I fihat question should be asked, just inform
litem that, he has been dead a great many
years, but that ho was my father, and u
good father ho was too, but he did'nt seem
to think, that idle horses made no butter.
Abraham.
The Strangle* in Morse*.
This is principally a disease incidental
to you.ig horses, usually appearing be; ween
the fourth and filth years. It is preceded by
cough and can at first be scarcely distinguished
from common cough, except that there
is more discharge from the nostril, of a yellowish
color, mixed wi.h mailer, but generally
without smell ; and likewise a considerable
discharge of ropy matter from the
' llion iiciiul t?n
mould* 3uu iiiuii uouu van'
der the throuf. This swelling increases
with uncertain rapidity, accompanied by
some fever and disclination to ear, partly
arising from the fever, but moie from the
pain the animal feels in the act of chewing.
There is considerable thirst, but afier a gulp
or two, the animal ceases to drink, yet is
ardently desirous of more, in the attempt
to swallow, and sometimes when not drinking,
a convulsive cough coitv-s on which
almost threatens to suffocate the animal ;
and thence, probably, the name of the disease.
The tumor is about the centre of the
channel of the under jaw; it soon fills the
whole space, and is evidently one uniform
body ; and may thus he dig inguished from
glanders or the enlarged glands of catarrh.
At length the centre of it becomes more prominent
and soft,and evidently contains fluid.
This rapidily increases, the tumor bursts,
and a great quantify of pus is discharged,
As soon as tho tuinor has broken, the
cough subsides, and the horse speedily
mends.
The treatment is very simple. As the
essence of the disease consists in the formation
and suppusation of the tumor of the
under jaw, the principal, or almost the sole
attention? should be directed to the hasten
ng of these processes. Therefore as soon
isiho tumor of strangles evidently appears,
he patt should be actively blistered. As
toon as the swelling is soft on the top, and
jvidently Contains matter, it should be deepy
and freely lanced. If the incision is
ieep and large enough, no second collec.
ion of matter will be found.

Cooking Potatoes.
There is n class of people who exceed
ill others within our knowledge in the application
of means to ends, in the metlwds ol
giving to domestic hfe all its comforts, in
making and preserving every thing useful,
in preparing their meat in due season, and
in furnishing not expensively, but in the
best manner, such food as is conducive to
health. That class is the people called
Shakers. To describe a single family of

lilts SllJgUIUI lAJIlllllulilijr, Iiuuiu uu iu v.?
scribe all other families?so much are they
alike in their manners and mode of living.
Without wishing 10 be obtrusive, we never
fail to call upon them so of en as we have
an opportunity, because we are richly p;ud
for every thing in the information we receive.
In concluding our late perambulation
which touched four of the eigut counties
of the State, we so timed as to invite ourselves
to tarry over night at Enfield, where
tnc aiaier in tiroes who keep ??ilie office"
seem always to iiavo received our v si;s
with all that kindness and so *iab lity which
could bo d< sired. A good supper or dinner
is always soon ready after our arrival; and
Friend Dyer cons ntmg to lake simple pay,
we have been emboldened to repeated calls.
We tarried with them on the night of the
27tn July. They had new potaioes on the
table ; but their olJ potatoes were better
than their new. it was a matter of general
complaint that potatoes were not good last
year?they were wet and soggy when cooked
; and so disagreeable to the taste had
they become, that for months we had made
our usual meal generally wither- tnem.
Wheth'T tfey will bo agreeable to the
tasto or not can generally he observed by
their appearance when brougnt to the tahle.
The Enfield sisters brought us some, which,
as they appeared, so they proved, to be, not
less welcome to Me taste than auy we h ive
ever eaten ; they were mellow and mealy
and their flavor was all we could desire as
an accompan ment of a preparation of
mea1. On asking the method of preparation
of potatoes for the table at a season nearly
a month later than it is common to make
use of the lust year's potatoes, 'he sister
having charge of he cookery discovered
the whole process.
The preparation is begun by taking a
sufficient quantity of potatoes from the cellar,
where they should always be kept until
this time, to lust three or four d.ivs or n
?
week sprouting and washing them clean. If
ihe potatoes are to be cooked for the morning
they arc then taken in the evening, and
if for dinner before breaks in the morning,
pared, not entirely, hut two-thirds or threefourths
of the skin on theoutsi ie ; they are
til 'n soaked several h.mra in?lonn cold water,
which operation is said to extract ulJ
those deleterious quuliles which are disagreeable
both to the eve and to the taste.
Boiled in a kettle of water until about twotmrds
cooked, a large portion of the water
is turned off, leaving the remainder toevaporato
in steam over and through the potatoes.
The result is, r2i.it even those potatoes
which are shrivelled with the lateness
of the season will come out as nvaly and
fresh as tlie best of potatoes when taken
ripe from the ground. -t ...
Wo behave this method of prepwrat'on
to be of such value that thousands of those
who have felt obliged to eat bad potatoes,

will th mk mo o.iaK'T sisier *i?u naa

FESERVATION OF APPLES.
The following practical observations,
contained in o letter from Noah Webster,
have been published in ih Massachusetts
Agricultural Repository?
** It is the practice with some persons to
pick apples in October, and first spread
them on the floor of an upp<'r#room.?-This
practice is said to render apples more durable,
by drying them. But I can affirm
this to be a mistake. Apples af er remaining
on the trtje as long as safety from the
host will admit, should be taken directly
from tho trees to close casks, and kept as
dry and cool as possible. If suflerred to
he on the floor for weeks, they wither and
lose their flavor, without acquiring any additional
durability. The best mode of pre.
serving apples for spring use, I nave found
to be, the pu ting of them in dry sxnd as
soon as picked. For this purpose, procure
dry sand in the heat of summer, and late
in October put down ihe apples in layers,
with a covering of stud upon each layer.
Tho siugular advantages of this mode of
treatment are these : 1st. The sand keeps
the apples from the air, which is essential
to their preservation. 2d. The sand
checks the evaporation of the apples, thus
preserving them in their full flavor?at the
same time any moisture yielded by the apples,
(and some there will be,) is absorbed
hw tho srinH so tlmt the armies are kent drv?
"j """" ~ " ----- ! I - - I " - j'
and all mustiness is prevented. My pip.
p.us in M.?y and Juiio, are as fresh as when
first picked : even the ends of the stem look
as if just separated from the twig."
Judge Bjel, a practical farmerof great experience,
and also a man of science, advises,
that a farmer should till no more land
than he can keep dry and clean, and rich :
and that he should keep no more stock than
his crops will feed well, and that can be
made profitable to the farm.
SILK CULTURE,
SILK AND TREES.
A Cincinnati correspondent of the National
Gazette makes the following remarks :?
"As some evidence that we of the west
are wdkng to back our suggestions by substantial
proof of our sincerity in this matter.
I may mention a single instance of a recent
purchase of trees by a gentleman of Ohio,
and which illustrates tbo deficiency of supply
in this quarter of ihe country. The
gentleman referred to is now erecting a
cocoonery on a very extensive scale, but not
having lime to raise trees next spring, from
shoots or cuttings, lor feeding his worms,
is compelled to purchase them of this summer's
growth for that purpose. According,
ly he recently purchased of Mr. John S.
Chapman, of Mead * county Ky. and the
only person I know of in the west whose
crop tias not failed, Ins entire crop of about
25,000, at 55 cents a piece, to which will
be added the additional expense of transporting
them some 200 mil' s. This he considers
a great bargain. I hazard little ir
saying that five or ten millions of ;rees could
be sold in this immediate valley. (Ohio,) al
this time, or in the fall, lor prices ranging
from 50 cents to one dollar. Nor will the
demand cease with the coming seuson. Ai

five years in the United States, the demanc
will not be supplied, much less the m trkei
overstocked, for ihe next ten years. 1 speul

The wes: is just awakening to the import
ance of this subject.
The increase of trees during the last sea
son has not met the expectations and hopcj
of thesilk culiurist. In many places the}
have utterly failed from the unusual unfriend
lifit'ss of the spring. In conclusion, | ma^
add that I do not own over 500 trees my
self, and that I expect to be a purchaser fo
the next two years, as i am preparing t<
builJ a cocoonery in this State."

Burlington, N. J. Sept. 1.
"That portion of the community wh

the country are for sale ; but it is far fror
being the case, for very many! arge field:
besides the still larger number of smalle
ones, are designed to remain permanent, ft
the purposo of the ?itk culture. In the Vi
cinity of Richmond I visited several distin- l
guished persons in the silk culture, and to i
my satisfaction I found things firmly ad- <
vancing in the right way. Mr Curtis Carter I
has on his plantation a cocoonery 130 feet i
long, 30 feet wide, and two stories high, i
with a cellar in which to keep his leaves
fresh, Mr. Carter had just begun to gather i
the cocoons from a crop of worms he had
fed, the production of nine ounces of eggs,
and had met with excellent success. He
was selling his mulberry trees to his neighbours
and planters who want them, in srni.ll
Jo's of 500 or 1000 trees, for their own use,
and pay in most part about fifty cents each.
He had sold 20,000 trees or more in this
retail wav, to be planted next year for the
silk culure. Thomas Pleasants <fe Co., of
B'dlona Arsenal, have made a good beginning,
nnd laid the foundation for a permanent
business. They have a large number
of acres planted with trees at distances, to
remain stationary, to furnish leaves for feeding
next year and years after. The Arsenal
Buildings they will occupy for cocooneries ;
they are very spacious and well adapted.
On my way through Virginia into North
Carohna, I found that the planters pretty
generally verei n the spirit of beginning
the silk culiure in a small way, to maKe h
a collateral branch of their farming, as employment
for their weaker lat.our, which i
consider tho proper course. Tne planters;
s iy ihry must give up their cotton growing
in a measure to the more southern s'ates,
i and hegiti to think that silk wi I be the proper
substitute to give employment to their
infirm labour. The few trials that have
been made has given them ample proof that
' the mulberry will flourish well even in their
worn-out soils, and the silk-worms can be
[ managed well even by their coloured popu
iation. I foun that the ladies of wealthy
i families were quite in tne spirit of the silk
i culmre; sr,d w6rc iurning their own hands
> to the business, and speak of it in its true
! light, as being every way worthy their most
earnest attention. When the ladies embark
t in a worthy enterprise, it is pietty sure to
> be enrried through with spirit aud in a pro*
i p^r manner.
r In Virginia and North Carolina in the
i most favorable portions for the silk culture,
, the moru-.multicaulis trees are being bought
i in small lots by the planters for their own
i uses at 60 cents per tree, and some very
good trees for more, and many sales of buds
> at two cents each, but of retail quantities,
! and in this way the trees are fast getting
out of market. I am sure there are no more
I trees ut the south than the people want for
I their own use this year. Last year the
frees were confined to the soa-porfs and
cities, and were sent north for a market; J
but this year they are being sent back
I amongst the planters, in their proper plaees.
, for use, wi ere ac shull, in a very f w years,
I have a return from them in raw silk or silk
fabrics. C. S.

. of a knowl or elevation, a large hole, that
t would admit a man's body without much
difficulty. Curiosity led them to make pre?
parations for descending into it; and after
. necessary preparations, and an accession
I of company they entered this mysterious
t place. At the depth of about sixty feet,
they found themselves in a substerraneous
cavern or room, aoparenly cut of solid
rock (through which they had passed for
m .ny leet,) which appeared to be sixteen or
i. eighteen feet square. Our informant was
i the first person who entered the room, and
i he was not a little surprised that the first o >
i ject which met his eyes was a human skull,
, with all the teeth en'ire. Upon further ex.
animation, it was found that the whole place
was filled with skeletons of men, women

to examine how deep the bones

one place between four and seven feet, but

? A French Chem si lias discoved a
, mode of making tallow candles to resemble
i wax candles, both in color and tn burning.
1 The process employed to convert the tallew
, into white wax is verv' ingenious. It conr
sists of various operations of boiling, purir
fying and pressing. A hydraulic press,
> wrought by o steam engine, is used. White
the pressure is applied, a dark yellow oil
squeezed from tho tallow. The expulsion
of the oil leaves the substance of the tallow
hard and whi'e like wax. So close is the
r-semblunce which these compressed tallow
candles have to wax candles, that no person,
without a close examination, could discover
the difference, while they are only one half
the price. Large quantities are now manu.
factured at an establisi ment in London.
They are unquestionably a great improve*
merit and must soon supercede the common
tallow candle. It should not be long before
a munufac.ory of the kind is established in
this country, N. Or eans Bulletin.

The Mascal Plant.?This cxtraordin.
ary vegetable production, (a description of
whirh has- never been published) is only to
be found on t e Rio Gr n !e, and its tribut.
ary sreams, N. VV.ofthe Mexican republic?it
grows spon'aoeously on the most
barren and sterile mountains in that country,
und is as much esteemed as an article
of food by the Mexican Indians as if the *
Buffalo, the Elk, and the Deer, by their
more Northern neighbors. The M iscal *
grows in the shape of a cabbage head, aud
may be found as large in size as a half bar*
ref; it is thickly covered with shark prickly
protuberances to the length of from twelve
to eighteen inches, fhe root is very small
t ie head has also a thick covering of leaves,
much resembling in shape those of the PUq.
tation tree, which are very juicy, und wheo
prepared for eating in the same manner as
the head, afford a sweet and nutritious be- I
vcrnge, answering every purpose to allay a J
thirst. "
The process used for cooking this plant
is very singular, yet if digressed from in a
single instance the Mascal is spoiled and ren.
' dercd unfit for use ; it consists of digging a
hole or pit in the ground to the depth of
four or five feet, which must be covered
with a layer of heated rocks, on- which the
Mascal is to be placed with the root downward
; a thick cost of !eaves and bushels
i must be thrown over tne mouth of the pit,
| over all of which is to be lain a thin coat of
dirt just sufficient to prevent the heat or
stearn from escaping. In this situa ion
must the Mascal remain (according to Indian
computation?for three days and three
nights, when it may be taken out, and will
be found perfectly cooked, and most delicious
food. In flavour it resembles a ripo
1 in? llow peach, each succeeding day adding
to its good qualities, it in creases in excellence
by age. On this plant alone do tho
Indians subsist for months, being perfectly
satisfied wi h their food, und esteeming it
above all other. About half a pound of
Mascal is by thein deemed sufficient to satisfy
the cruvings of hunger for a day, and
is always curried with th m on their hunting
nnd other excursions.?As I before observe
1, the leaves of tnis favoured plant contain
a rich and de igh'ful beverage, altogether
forming a*most extraordinary combination
of food and drink, thus affording another
illus ration of the beia-ficonce of a kind Providence
in securing even to the wild and
untutored savage a luxury which their more
fivored Imd c w lized brethren might well
envy.
1 have seen the Mascal so 'hick in some
places as to form an almost impenetrable
forest of thorns, as formidable in appearance
as would be the same number of glitteriog
spears, convering the whole expense of !be
cnuntry ns far as the eye could see, in travel
ing through which the incautious or unwury
will be reminded by a gentle stab of
the necessity there is to have a care.

REMARKABLE ESCAPE.
. On the passage of the ship Alexander,
from New Orleans to New York, o young
lad abou; 14 years old, from a naturally
frolieksome and mischievous disposition,
become so iroublesome in his pranks, that
it was threatened by the Captain if they
were continued, that he would confine him
in a water cask. Our youngster took no
b"ed, however, and at his next offence was
put in the cask, which was headed up,
leaving a large bung tole for the admission
of air. That nigf-t the ship encountered a
violent storm, nnd in a sudden lurch, the
cask cout uning the boy rolled over ntoi
the sea. The circumstance was not noticed
by those on board. For unately the cask
struck bung up, and floated about thirty
hours, when it was thrown upon the Beach
Cape at St. BIa9. Here the boy mado
desperate efforts to extricate himself from
his prison without success, and in despair
gave up to die. Some cows how? ver gtrol
ling on the Beach, were attracted to th
cask, and in walking around it one of the
number, it being fly time, switched her tail
in o ii e ' u hole, which the lad grasped
with adesperateiresolutior. The cow bel.
lowed and set off lor life, and after running
some two hundred yards with the cask,
struck it against a log on the b ach, and

ARTIFICIAL GRANITE ROAM.
Since Wednesday week a number of
workmen have been employed in laying
down a new pathway in that part of Bird
Cage wjilk just at Storey's gate, and front*
ing the late residence of the honorable MrsNorton.
Tno material composing the pathway
is a new invention, styled a artificial
granite," and is a " mineral, animal, and
vegetable combination." The process a**
dopteri in the laying it down is similar to
tha' of the asphalte, the composition being
poured out boiling hot, upon the loose gravel,
with which it is amalgamated. A few
minutes suffice to make tne composition
