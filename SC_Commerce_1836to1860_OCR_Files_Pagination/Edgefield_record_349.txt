to consume you. And it may be so.
Greater men upon the page of history,
have been alike unfurtunate. We have is
the present day some signal instatices of
the early blight of exalted reputation.
Think of these things, and be 'wise.
"Those most assume, who-knao the least,
Their own false balance;gives e'm weight,
But ev'ry other. fds 'em light."
Let me advert-more particularly to one
of your concrusions; " Up Country an
oJice seeker." ..And yet you declare that
he is opposed to the almost unanimous
voice of the State. This is certainly a
novel way of getting-office. What reek
lesmness of assertion on your part! What
logical deduction ! But you, according to
your own confession, have gone with the
overwhelming majority, and common
sense will decide between us. A word to
my readers, and I am done. In the com
munication which drew forth the pompous
commentary from " Amicus," it was ex
pressly remarked, that "I have nothing
to say against Col. Richardson." He had
been nominated by the Mercury-the
nomination approved by the Carolinian,
and noticed favorably by the Advertiser.
The humblest citizen in the State, has
the right to make the inquiries. Is he the
candidate of the majority of the Legisla
ture? Has be been fixed upon by the
State Rights party ? By what authority
are these public statements made ? These
questions were asked as was stated, "in
no offensive spirit." Not one syllable
spoken against Col. R." If to say a word
in behalf of another gentleman, whose
name I had heard for upwards of a year.
in connection with the Executive office
without disparagement to any other, be a
crime, then am I guilty. But I could not
have conjectured, that in the brief enun.
ciations of Col. Hammond's qualifications,
such formidable exceptions would have
been taken, to the word "State Rights,"
and that in the language of a committee
of the British House of Commous, on a
memorable occasion, the bare mention of
this once popular epithet, would at so
early a period, have been considered "a
most transcendaut presumption, of a most
dangerous consequence." The impartial
reader, will pronounce the assault of
" Amicus" unprovoked, and unmerited.
I am not insensible to the good opinion
of the virtuous and honorable, and will
maintain my position of defence, not with
fear and trembling for the result, but with
the honesty and firmness, which belong to
principle. UP COUNTRY.
Mr. Editor
We have repeatedly heard, (among a
number of other gentlemen,) Dr. R. C.
Griffin, spoken of,,as a candidate to repre
sent our District at the next session of the
- Legislature, and we hope er'e long to see
his name announced, through the columns
of the Advertiser.
We do not inteud, at this time, to urge
the claims of Dr. G., but will briefly re
mark, that his entire devotion to his na
tive District, his retiring and modest de
portment, his amiable and virtuous char
acter, his high and honorable feelings in
all the relations of life, etntitle him to the
voluntary suffrages of the virttuous and
the good. A VOTER.
Our attention being called to something
else, we made no comnme'ut yesterday on
the Barnwell meeting, which, "as the
uieighbors of Cul. Hammond," endorses
that gentlemani's nomination, and gives
reasons for supporting him.
This is as it should be. There is plenty
of time for the friends of the respective canm
didates to say all they can for them; and
for that very reason to talk about "fore.
stalling," as the Barnwell preamble does,
is mere fudge. Let thenm go on informing
the people what are their candidate's pub
lic claims. Nobody is pledged against
him; and ifhby next winter the penple are
convinced that he is the best unmed, he
will be elected. We do not observe in
their enumeration of Col. H.'s claims,any
which have not already been conceded to
Col. Richardson, except having served
in the militia. Not living in his bent, we
will not testify from personal knowledge,
but we presume-we are almost sure-nay.
we will venture to assert-lhat Col. Rich
ardson has served in the militia.-Charles

Health of the Cit y.-A report, we under
stand, has gained a circulation in many
parts of the country, that the city is very
unhealthy, and in some instances has
been so exaggerated as to induce the im
'pression on the mitnds of the credulous.
that the fatal epidemic of the last autumn
is prevailing to an alarming extent.
What coald have influenced any one to
give currency to such an unfounded rumor
we know not, for certainly nothing could
be more fa'lse. When we were first ad
vised of the existence of the report, we
supposed the good setnse of the people
would at once discountenance it ; but
since we have heard of its spreading still
mtore, and gathering more alartming fea
tures in its progress, we notice it, to say to
those who desire to visit the city either on
business or pleasure, that the city was
never more healthy, or at least so say those
who have the best means of knowing.
For our own part, we have been in the
city now near two months, and we have
not seen a funeral or even beard of a case
of sickness ofany kind wvhatever.--Chtroni

EDGEFIELD C. 11.
TnURSDAY, MARCH 19, 1840.
The Session of the Court of Common
Pleas, will commence on Monday next.
Judge Butler presides.
We have had more rain this last week,
than has fallen before during the previous
twelve months. The earth is so parched,
however, by the heavy drought, under
which we have been suff'ering, that it will
do but little good, we fear, unless it should
be followed by an extremely wet season.
We will make no comments upon Mr.
Calhoun's Speech, the first part of which,
appears in our columns to-day. His name
will ensure its being read, and the truth
and clearness of his arguments, will en
sure its being believed.
Our Correspondent "Edgefield" inflexi
bly maintained for one whole week the
"position of an amateur observer of the
sport" in the Gubernatorial chase ; but in
our present number, instead of "quietly
watching the process" in others, be has
"spun a yarn" of his own. His reason
for revoking his determination previously
announced, seems to be that we had "gra
tuitously assigned him a station among
the number of Col. R.'s supporters." We
take leave to say that the assertion, that
we classed him as a "supporter" of Col.
Richardson is "gratuitous," and that the
remark we (lid make was strictly justi
fied by his own article. Our remark was
" we are gratified that our correspon
dents vere mistaken in supposing that
"Edgefield" was opposed to the election
of Col. J. P. Richardson." And although
we do not profess to he very learned phi
lologists, we can hardly be so much mis
taken in the force of language, as to err in
supposing that our remark does not more
strongly imply that "Edgefleld" was a
"supporter" or Col. R., than his own "ex
plicit statement" that "he feels no repug
nance to the elevation of Col. R, to the
office of Governor." Col. R. "possibly"
(leaving even that doubtful,) "would not
have been the choice of Edgefield, but he"
(E.) "certainly never designed to dispar
age him before the public, or to insinuate
that he was unworthy of the post," &c.
We sup posed that from our editorials on
this subject, calm and devoid of all per
sonality as they were, enough heat could
not have been extracted to have put any
one, except a Preston and Bank man, in a
stew. %We are therefore at loss to know
how we have given ofronceto "Edgefield."
H e assured us that he enjoyed the "confi
dence and friendship" of Col. R.-that he
duly appreciated I* many excellent quali
ties and personal worth"-that he enter
tained for him "the highest personal re
spect, and sentiments of esteem and con
sideration inspired by the kind relation of
old acquaintance" and last, though not
least, that "he felt no repugnance to his
elevation to the ojJce of fovernor." T n ad
dition to this, "Edgefield" admits that "the
organization of the oll parties" (the Nul
Sification & Union) "no longer exists in the
State"-"that the lines of separation have
been obliterated, ahd both" (Union men
atnd Nullifiers) "are notw harmoniously uni
ted in the patriotic effort of serving the
'State"-"that to carry out the compro
mise which was happily effected in the
Session of 1831, all th~e public ojices should
be open and accessible to each party, and
that "the present state of public opinion"
and " the true interests of the State,"
would render the elevation of agentleman
from the ranks of the Union party, to the
ojfice of Governor, liberal, toise, prudent,"
and " magnanimous!l" In our simplicity,
we supposed that "Edgefleld" was seri
ous, and hazarded the opinion that our
correspondents were mist aken, in thinking
that he was opposed to Col. R.'s election.
" The very head and front of our offend
ing, hath this extent, no more," unless,
indeed, he excepts to our being gratiled
at the supposed extinction of his hostility.
Should this be the case, as wve do not de
sire to give offence, and are not entirely
suro that either Col. R.'s success, or our
own happiness can be very materially
affected by his course, wve wvill agree, for
the sake of peace, not to feel quite mo gra:
ified--or even if it he absolutely necessary,
not to feel gratified at all.
If our correspondent be really opposed
to Col. R., (in reference to which fact,
however, we desire as yet to remain en
tirely uncommitted.) it must be from pref
erence' of some other individual, and can
dor requires that this preference should be
indicated. It might be policy in our cor
respondent to "keep dark" on this head,
it his purpose wvere to aggravate any un
popularity of Col. R., for the indirect end
of impairing the popularity of some of his
supporters here; but if, as we presume,
he looks to the good of the State, and not
selfish ends, it is but fair that he should
declare the candidate for whose benefit
he is prolonging the discussion.
Edgefield broadly accuses all. classes of
Col. R.'s advocates, editors and correspon
dents, of " intolerance and proscription,"
and indirectly acecss them o "unm.,i
ted deuuciation," "indelicate interrnga
tion," "disparaging insinuations," "offien
sive attempts at intimidation," &c., &c.
Our correspondents are fully able to defend
themselves; but we are unwilling to sub
mit without gainsaying to our share of this
obloquy. We deny the whole, so far as
we are concerned, and ask for the specifica
tions and'the proof of this vague and "un
merited denunciation."
We are utterly at a loss to conjecture to
what our correspondent alludes, when lie
talks of "offensive attempts at intimida
tion," as we have heard of nothing intend
ed, or calculated to affright the most timo
rous. And as to " denunciation and in
sinnation," we apprehend it would be dif
ficult to find any where a richer specimen
than is afforded by the article of our cor
respondent. Without even the pretence
of argument or evidence, he rails against
all classes of Col. R.'s advocates, and
darkly iutimates that he could bring graver
charges if he would. As to interrogato
ries, though we deny that any of ours just
ly deserve the epithet of "'indelicate,"
we confess we have some fondness for
them, and our correspondent must pardon
an unpractised writer, for adopting the
style that lie finds most easy, and natural.
If to interrogate, be an offence, we must
here repeat it, and respectfully.ask some
cluestions of our corresponde'nt himself.
Was there no " disparaging insinuation,"
of unfitness for the high office of Gover
nor, when our correspondent " damned"
Col. R. " with the faint praise" of being
a. gentleman "of good education, and cour
teous manners; but notmore than the e
qual of thousands in the State ?" Was
there no "disparaging insinuation," in
mentioning, as one of Colonel Richard
son's highest merits, that he was once.
"a respectable member of the State Le
gislature 7" Was there nothing unfair, in
attempting, before damning hint with this
faint praise, to produce the impression that
he, (Edgefield,) was one of Col. R.'s old
est and most sincere friends, and conse
quently was disposed even to exagger
ate his merits Was there no "dispar
aging insinuation," of loss of confidence,
by the State Rights party, in the editor of
the Mercury, when lie was spoken of as
the " once trusted and influential organ of
that party 7" Did our learned correspon
dent by his " tres in uno," veil no - dis
paraging insinuation" against the correct
ness of our statement, that the essays in
one of our numbers in favor of Col. R.,
written by three writers? Could there were
have been any occasion for the exercise of
"intolerance and proscription," if our
correspondent and others had not chosen
to disparage the nominee for Governor,
made through the recognized organs of
phblic sentiment, amid to put forth their
own unminces ? Who began this discus
sion, and interrupted the general tendency
of our whole people, to harmonize and
break up old- party distinctions? Who
are now seeking to depart from the true
issue by raising collateral questions, many
of them mischievous as leading to mere
personal altercation ?
We shahl not further followv our cor
respondent in departure from the true issue.
Col. Richardson, of undisputed moral, and
intellectual qualifications for the office,
was nominated for next Governor, by the
editor of the Mercury, at the instance of
some members of the Legislature; and
the nomination has been generally ap
proved, as likely to heal old party feuds,
and unite in stronger bonds, all in theState,.
who are in favor of the Independent Treas
ury. EIbhrta, however, have been since
made, to divide the old Union Party, by
proposing Chancellor Johnson as a can
didate, and to divide the Nullifiers
by proposing Colonel Hamnmond, and
attempting to revive, fur his benefit,
the dead and dying prejudices, personal
and political, connected with tha stale
controversy of Nullification. The true
question is, shall the State act with undi
vided energy upon political qtuestions of
present, and pressing interest,-or shall
we renew old party strifes, next subdi
vide upon personal preferences, and, in
the end, permit the miserable Batik and
Preston faction among us, to direct the
movements of the State, by taking advan
tage of our squabbles. It was our earnest
hope, that all discussion would have ceased
for the present, & time be allowed for calm
reflection. If we are to be disappointed
in this hope, wve must at least entreat our
correspondents hereafter, to~ discuss prin
ciples, and not wander into profitless hick
erings.

WAsHINTorN, March 7, 1840.
The Senate adjourned, at a late hour.
last night. The debate was continued
with great spirit. Mr. Preston and Mr.
Clay both declared that they had always
believed that the object of this administra
tion was to destroy commerce, prostrate
credit, establish a metallic currency, abol
ish the banks, &c., and they had under
stood these measures to be advocated by
the orgaas' of the administration. Mr.
King, of Alabama, and Mr. Brown, of
N. C., disclaimed this policy, and declared
that the Senators had no warrant for im
puting it to the administration.
Mr. Benton and Mr. Allen, who were
particularly alluded to by Mr. Clay, made
no explanation. Mr. Preston endeavored
to bring them out, as well as his colleague.
Mr. Calhoun said, lie would suffer no
one to say for him, what his principles
were on these subjects. Long experience
had shewn him what was the character of
these institutions. He made no war upon
the banks-but they were perishing by
self-slaughter-a train of moral and po
litical developements was in progress,
which would lead to their complete over
throw. They carried within them, the
seeds of their own destruction. He would
never assent to the doctrines or proposi
tions of the Senator from Pennsylvana,
(Mr. Buchanan,) in regard to the continu
ance of tle banks, and the recognition of
them, by the General Government. He
differed toto calo, fron the gentleman on
this subject He was opposed to his prop
osition to amend the Constitution, with a
view to regulate the bank, because that
would necessarily eniraft them upon our
Constitution. After Mr. Calhoun had ex
pressed these views, Mr. Clay, of Ky.,
exclaimed-" that is manly-that is can
did-open." The intimation on the part
of Mr. Clay and others, was that these
radical projects were forwarded by many
who did not openly avow them.
The Senate finally adopted by a strong,
majority, the resolutions and report against
the assumption of State Debts-so that
matter is ended.
The Senate did not sit to.day.
The House has again been engaged the
whole day, on a knotty point of order, re
lating to the presentation, by the Speaker,
of some documents relative to the Jersey
case.
There is a prospect that the Jersey case
will be settled, for the present, on Tuesday
next, by the admission of Messrs. Vroum,
Dickerson, &c.
From the Augusta Constitutionalist.
AUGUSTA MARKET, MARCH 12.
Cotton.-During the week, our market
has been extremely dull, and prices re
main much about the satne as last noticed.
The absence of foreign intelligence has
kept buyers out of the market, as holders
have shown no disposition to recede from
their asking prices, and yesterday, when
we closed our inquiries, both sellers and
huyers were standing off. At the present
time our stocit is much the same as repor
ted on the first inst., the receipts since that
period being about equal to the outgoings.
The sales this week have been confined
mostly to small lots, and amount to about
1500 bales, at the following prices, viz:
11 bales i5 cents, 5 at 5J. 6 at 5J, 8 at
6, 13 at 61, 18 at 61, 23 at 61, 3:3 at 7, 67

7J, 540 at 8,199 at Si, 153 at 84, and 14
at 8A. The demand continues confined
principally to the better descriptions. We
continue former quotations, with the re
mark that the market closed yesterday
dull. Inferior 5 a 6, middling 64, a 7,
fair 71 a 8, prime and choice Si a 84.
Groceries.-We think we can see a de
cided improvement in our grocery market
-business begins to stir with the coutntry,
and our merchants are getting of their
stocks at fair prices. There is no scarcity
of uny article that we hear of, and our
prices remain pretty much the same as
last noticed.
C'orn.-This article remains quite dull
of sale; 50 cents is now the asking price
from wagons. Corn Meal is selling from
wvagons at 626 cents per bushel.
Preights-Continue (lull, and we have
no change to notice in rates, which remain
as last reported, viz: To Savannah $1 per
bale; to Charleston by Railroad 40 cents
per 100 lbs. for square, antd 50 for round
bales cotton.

A tite present it re, this section of coua.
try is suffering under a severe drought;
and we learn that such is the case through
Out the middle and upper Districts. The
water courses are almost as low as any
time during last summer. In Georgia, al
so, there is said to be a remarkable drought
for the time of year, whilst sections of the
Northern and Eastern States are deluged
with rain. The weather has been cold
and chilly for several days past, and we
have bad some frost two or three mornings
this week. Fears were entertained for
the fate of the fruit (blossoms from many
of the trees having fallen) but it has so far
escaped, and vegetation is as much ad

A Disappointment.-Some person or
persons broke into this office last night,
sometime after 9 o'clock. They forced
both doors. What was their object we do
not know, unless it was plunder. If the
thieves sought money, they were sadly
disappointed-they went to "the goat's
house to seek for wool," when they thought
to get money in a printing office. Perpaps
they mistook our location for that of our
neighbours of the Marine- Hank. Look
out for the rascals.-Sav. Telegraph 6th

The Suspended Bank Promises.-We
are informed that the tax officers and offi
cers of Court do not feel themselves author
ized to accepi ihe hills of suspended Bnnk4
-to redeem such notes as may he offered
in payment of dues to the States-or any
otherspecified debts, and will refute on the
ground that they are not authorized by law
-and on the farther ground, that the pro
mise of a Bank pulished in a newspaper,
is no better security than the promise of a
Bank on the face of its own bill.
The House of Representatives, says
the Jackson Missippian, has decided upon
the right of the Legislature to repeal
Bank charters, and have instructed the
Committee on Banks and Banking to re
port a bill requiring the Banks to resume
specie payments by the first of April next,
on pain of a forfeiture of their corporate
franchise. The vote was 47 to 34.
