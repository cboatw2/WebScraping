SELECTING SEED CO EN.
* Every one is acquaint* d with the fact,
that plants of any variety, grown from seeds
obtained in a higher lati'udo, or what is in
eff-ct the same thing, a greater elevation
will come to maturity, and ripen their seeds
earlier, than when the process is reversed,
and the soeds nre obtained from a lower
latitude,-or more depressed position. In no
plant is the effect more. conspicuous than
in corn,.and the present season has afforded
numberless opportuoi ies of testing the truth
of^the tlrory. Where corn has been
bTwg'it from the vallies to the bills and
planted, it hn been uniformly later in tas
1!- 1 '* .U?. at ?hf?

same elevation ; and where com has been
brought from the north or the south for any
distance, the same results may beobserved ;
it* the first ensc the corn coming forward,
?l. in the Inst case b< ing later than that grown
"n*- 4tcft?luced in cpe same neigiibofhood.
Admitting Mr. Thocburohr statement
of the growth of his China tree corn,
and the ttme of its being fit for boiling to be
correct; that corn, distributed over the north
from Long Island, and some of it planted at
much greater elevations, furnishes the most
striking proof of the impolicy of selecting
seed corn from a more southern region that
ire havo yet seen. On the line of the Erie
canal, two'degrees further north by latitude,
" and one more by elevation. (ftOO feet in el,
inttMMi being considered equal to a degree,)
the corn irhttrh was fit to boil by (he tenth
of July on Lbng Island had scarcely silked
by the tenth of August, und would show few
roasting or boiling ears by the first of 3cplember.
Another instance we find in the
August Ctflii valor. Judge Buel says?
' We>reeeired la??t spring twelve ears ol
Putton com from Mr. Osborn, of Oswego
router, his residence differing from ours in
Intftudeand aid ude about two degrees.
We otanted wi h this seed eight rows across
our field, the residue tF'ing planted witn
com of our own raising. The Oswrgn
corn tassftled two weeks earlier than thai
front ect'd raised at Albany, thus showing
six craven daysdifference for a compu.
ted degree of latitude in tbo enrliness of the
crop^?the northern seed giving the earl'msi
corn irr a ratio inverse to the forwardness ol
the aea*oo.M
Such facts should not be lost upon the
firmer, asiber have an important bearing
on many points of agriculture, and may
materially affect the goodness or socuri'j ol
b's crop injured by frosts, or wheo, on othei
accounts, it k desirable to have it come to
maturity early, seed from a more elevated,
or more-northern region, should uniformly
be selected, fn choosing seed corn, this is
especially "tipo**"***, nnA
ducedaro conclusive, and should not be
overlooked or forgotten. Well filled ears;
those that hive two or more} on 4 stalk ;
and that r pen the earliest ; will be found t#
be best and most productive, and should be
chosen at .the proper season, without lea v.
tag any thing to after selection or chance.

price brought by Mr Physick'g trees sold at
auction near Philadelphia in September induced
others to advertise their trees to be sold
also at auction. But before the tinc? of the
sales arrived the suspension of specie payments
in Philadelphia and other places with
an unprecedented scarcity of money came on,
and trees forced off at auction lilro all other
articles not wanted for immediate use, brought
next to nothing. By those who manage more
judiciously* however, sales are still made at
good prices. Air. Robert Sinclair, Sen lately

tlVAL TO tffg pAGUERREOTYPEr
If we believe the German papers, Lei p.
man, of Berlin has invented a machine for
obtaining correct copies of oil-coloured pic*
lures, which is not less ingenious than the
Daguerreotype. For some years a little
slender man, whose attire denoiod ^>overtT?
was obsrcxed ia Uia"11n? tforttn,
wrrcre Tie was to be seen every week. Instead
of walking through the galleries
and examining the various paintings, ha
was in the Flemish room, stationed before
the same pictoro, a portrait of Rembrandt.
He would remain there, for hours together,
his hands behind his back, end his eyes
fixed upon the picture. This was ascribed
to excentricity, whilst it was a serious and
singular study, leading to a discovery which
will form an era in the hisory of pointing.
Mr. Leipmao was meditating upon the in.
vention of a machine for reproducing oil
paintings ; and, after ten y?ars of persevering
labour, he has succeeded beyond all expcctation.
At his residence nro to be seen
above a hundred copies of thnt very head
of Rembrandt, all of them of scrupulous re.
semblance to another. Ho#he has achieved
this, is his own secrot. When onoeonsiders
what privations he must have suffered
in realizing his idea, one cannot help
wishing that tits fcflbrts may be rewarded.
With the assistance of a trust-worthy maidservant,
he has laboured for many years,
n'ght and day, making sealing wax at night
to mike n livelihood. Tlie most surprising
circumstance is, that he did not preciously
make a complete copy of the picture, but
conveyed it home by part*, as he had it in
his mind after visiung the Museum. Thus,
on one day it was an eye, on another the
nose, on a third a lock of hair that he took i
home, which must have required wfiole
years for the completion of his task. Ho
has procured with his machioe, in one of
the rooms of the Royal Museum, and in
presence of the directors, 110 co, ies of
Rembrandt's portrait, painted by himself?
a picture, the copying of which in the usual
' way presents tho utmost difficulties, according
to tho opinion, of all painters. Lcipman's
copies are said to be perfect, and to
give the most delicate shades of the colour,
lie asks but a louis d'or for a copy, (lis
invention excites universal admiration.

MERCHANTS AND PLANTERS CONVENTM*. ,
Thursday Oct. 24, 1832 j
Honorable Thomas Butler King. Chair- i
man of the Committee of Twenty-One, tub- |
milled the following - 1
report:
The Committee to whom was referred
the Resolution instructing them to present
the subjects on which the Convention was
railed upon to deliberate end act, beg feave
to Report:
J That afer the full exposition whica is
contained in the tJotton Uirculnr adoptea
by tho Planters and Merchants, at their
meeting in the City of New-York, on the
5th of July Inst, they deem it in tome de?
grin; superfluous, minutely to explain or to
document
We have therefore convened for the puf.
pose of considering:
1st. Whether there be any inherent de_ '
ect in the mode and manner of shipping
out great staple under 'be existing System
of advances, by the Agents of the
Foroigr, nouses, through whom it has been
hitherto principally exported ?
2J. Whether, if tbo injurious tendency
of the system bo demonstrable, there exists
within ourselves any remedy ?
We will now, as succinctly as possible,
proceed to the h
u ? wesi gnowtrmntwrTrme exception of the
very inconsiderable portiont?f the very ctop
purchased under direct orders, for the spin.;
ners, and for Foreign account, the great bulk
of our Cotton is shipped either by the Planter
or Merchant, or dealer, under advances
made by the ngents of foreign houses.?
The mode in which this operation is coo.
ducted, is as follows:
Usually, the Banks in the Southern States
advance the money that moves forward
the wliole crop, (or nearly so,) on letters
of credit, as security. The bills founded
upon these securities, nre usually at 60 days
sight. They are forwarded at once; but
the Cotton being much more tardy in its
movement, they frequently mature, before
its arrival; nnd if the Cotton has to be
forced upon the market; or the accepter of
the bill has to pledge the Cotton to Brokers
or Bankers, to raise the money to meet his
acceptance. This may be done when mo.
ncy is plenty, wi hout difficulty; but the
moment it becomes necessary for the hold.
*' ^ ? " ? ?!?.?. Dnnlf tn WMlllfVII t Vltt
eroi lliu vuiiuni or mw uuui\ iu SVHIIOW HIV 1
funds advanced on it, then the Cotton must
bo sold, whether during a depressed or fa
vorabl market. Whenever tho Bank of
England refuses to discount the Cotton re- 1
ceivor's bill upon his Broker, endorsed by
l:is B anker his Banker cannot give him any '
farther nvnns ; becuuse, peradventurc, tho
Bank of England has sot her faco nga nst I
transactions in Co ton. Then the Cotton 1
must be sold at any sacrifice to the spinners, *
who are well advi.-ed of the amount of our 1
s'aplo thus ready for sacrifice, and the pc. 1
riod when it must be forced upon the mat. r
kef. It moreover may happen ihat the bills 1
which the parties shaping the Co ton have }
received, may be goo-1, or good for nothing; I
and what does the planter and shipner trust f
to when he agrees to lake these bills in return
for the produce of h s industry ? He '
trusts, first, to thu nu hority of the Agent 1
to make the stipulated advance, and to diaw ?
die necessary bills on his principal. He c
trusts in the next place, to the incliiia'ion of n
the parties abro id?first, to accept the bills, 11
und, secondly, to pav them at maturity.?
But he trusts finally, to tho skill andjudgw ^
ment of the foreign house, in the realization r
of the property, and to their ability and dis. 11
position to hbid it until the most favorable
moment for its sale. The receiver of the n
Cotton risks nothing, but the difference be. ni
rwecn the market vulue arid flie price ad? si
vonced, unless the latter is both extruvn. 01
gftGt and speculative, (which one party ought ^
not to ask, nor the oilier give,) this risk i/
thfiing. ni
We are entirely aware that it may be
ged, that probably four-fifths of the pro*ice
of the Giohe is circulated by the means
Bills of Exchange. Jt is just as certain
at the protested bills, diawn against shipents
of Cotton, are sent back by thounds
and hundreds of thousands of dollars.
f every packet,whenever the market is ternirarily
or permanently depressed. If the
ice is high enough to cover them, they
e accepted, if not, the reverse inevitabl)
il'ows.
We think, from this sUitement, it must be
(together obvious, that our great staple \?
ithout any | rotection whatsoever; to
othing of the fact, that it may sonvl'me8

uyers of the article, rother than with the

xemption from this imputation which is
istly due to some of the English houses
^ho have adhered to the in crests of iheir
orrespondents with gmsf firmness and ftlelity,
amidst unexnuyded difficulties.
Indeed it is alogdtlier impossible to con.
:ejve n system of sale so utterly defenceless
or an article which performs such an es
lential io regulating the Exchanges
to influencing the currencry of our country.
W* will now proceed to the second

It may not to' out of place to advert t<

i suspension of specie payments throughou
he Americnn Republic. At that time ou
:ountry owed the excess in value of thi
mports over the exports of the Unite
Suites, in their trade with England.
To pay this balance in specie, was im
jracticable. An unusually favorable son
ion had given us a crop of unprecedente

States were neither wanting in the mear

of the Union was invoked, and to guard
part of the property so transmitted, throug
their instrumentality, from unnecessary sa<
nfice in the market of consumption, tf

tabltshed in Liverpool. The result of th1
agency in winding up the large crop <
1838, is conclusive proof of whut may t

r meeting enormous reclamations.
The inquiry therefore arises, whether
j cannot use our great staple, as the means
. resuscitating our Bank?, ol enabling them
, replenish their vaults with the precious m
i als, and thereby fort fy themselves for
? sumption, whilst they shall subserve the i
t portant purpose of proteciing tho great C

i We have not at the South the jniaes

I equal vnlue, at infinitely a less cost of pi
[ duction, .and without any expensive proe<
of complicated alchemy of easy convei

t in the process of this exchange allow oihi
to reap the benefits of this conversion ; a
. moment too. when our Banks require a i
I flux of bullion into their coffers or
equivalent in foreign exchange, in ord-r lit
at no distant day, they may redeem th<
faith with the public ? If the Banks in t
Southern Slates, advanced on the whe
Cotton crop of our country, it is quite ob
ous that they would, through the foreign c
changes, have what Would he equivalent
a supply annually, of eighty millions of t
precious metals. The exchanges of t
Union would in this event, bo centralis

And wt hove no hesitation in say it
that we believe if the Banks of the Sou
come forward promptly and generally, at
make advances, at sate rate3, to responsil
parties, on our crop that the most stupo
dously beneficial change will be effected i
the currency trade, and exchanges or 01

st With these manifest and multiplied blcs* .
jf sings before us, we invite the cordial concurrence
of the Southern Banks, Planters

10 are about to submit. We are aware, bow-?
jr ever, we should not perform our duty, or
hi very inadequately meet public expectation,
i. if we did not point out, practically, the modo
by which these desirable objects are to bejs
accomplished.
to First, it i* proposed at all the principal
ie shipping ports of the cotton States, that parn*
ties, whether planters, cotton merchants or
n. factors, should apply to the Hanks for such
re an advance on the cotton they hold, as may,
a be in contormity with the current rates and ?

in adva.ice asked for i{j too high it is quite
re competent tor the iosEfamoq mgkmg tfa ad v .
if' vnnee, to require in uddiUOO, all the security
1?? incident to un ordinary discounted note. It
would be altogether impracticable for this
In Convention to fix the standard of what
ild wou d or w ould not be a safe rate of adm,
vuncu; as this, of course, must depend 6u
an fluctuation questions of production and eon
he sumption?tlie first influenced by the vicis*
|y, situdfs of the seasons in our oma country ;
>e. and ihe lust, by the s'ate of trade abroad.?
m- This must, of course, be left to the sound
el, discretion of the Banks themselves. By rere
quuing this security at ftomu, the sprit of
id. feckless speculation would be repressed^
*m and the disastrous enibarrflsments of undbfi *
eir ured reclamations, to a vust amount averU
an ed. The party applying for the advance
ro- must produce the ware house receipt and
tes policy of insurance, duly assigned to tho
m. Bank ; or bill of lading, if the cotton is on
a? the eve of shipment abroad. The Batik, as
:he its equivalent, af'cr charging the interest

takes the sterling bill ol the shipper, at six

di. mutual agreement, it is arranged to which >
