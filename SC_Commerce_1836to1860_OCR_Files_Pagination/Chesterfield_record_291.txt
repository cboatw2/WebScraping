expenses duri ig the last year for labor, dung,

means ho adopted thus to double the fertility
of his soil.
' My farm," says he, "was in so low n
condition that it would not produce more
than ten bushels of rye, or twenty of corn
per acre; and as I had no other income
but what 1 could make upon this poor farm,
I set about farming in enrnes'. 1 found it
was va<n to attempt improvement wiihout
manure; so I contrived to get about f ur
hundred loads a year, three hundred of
which 1 made in the following manner. I
have marl, though of a very inferior quality.
I cart about one hundred loads of this into
my barn yard, and by yarding rny cattle
mr,n it throuoh the season, contrived to in
cease it to two hundred loads. I also cart
about fifty loads to my hog pen, on which
1 keep my hogs the year round. In this
way I got one hundred loads more, which
is excellent for potatoes, corn, &,c., and as
my farm is situated near the bay, I ob ain
from New York annually, from fifty to
seventy-five loads of the b st stable dung
at about one dollar per load on delivery, and
by mixing it with the earth. &c., make up
the four hundred loads. By this treatment
I find my land improves rapidly, and my
income in like proportion. But I am sorry
to say that many farmers among us who are
still pursuing the old land kiliing system,
scarcely making both ends meet. 1 might
say something concerning the beneficial
results of undraining, and of lime as a manure
, but I conclude for the present."
This communication affords a worthy
example of prudent industry and good man.

inanag'd, may be rendered more productive

centrate, in that assembly, ah tneir energies
both moral and intellectual, for never was
there a time so fraught with gloom and boding
to their substantial interest. Since
we have been converted into a stock-jobbing
people, may we date our misfortunes. The
planting capital, which of all others to be
successfully Invested, requires certain rather
than unoqual profits, however large, has
been operated upon by the expansions and
contractions of a money market,under the
control of those, who can only hope during
the fluctuations of trade, to amass large fortunes
from the use of their credit and th.-ir
funds. Prospects have been tied out, so
as to entice some of our sober farmers to
venture nearly their all in the scramble for
tock-jobhing eminence, while other capL
talists anticipating the sudden rise of prop,
erty in val le, after the abolishment of the
National Bank,bought lahds and negroes;
and to realize profits on re-sales, have forced
prices to artificial and unwarrantable standards
; so that, while the price of negroes, of
lands, of houses and rents, has been increa.
sed by the over-issues of the Banks at
home, our staple articles have been regular
led by a'foreign demand ; and in this way,
the measure of the planter's expenses have
doubled, whib* his ability to pay for what
he consumes, remnins the same, or has dimtnished.
Let the Banks issue ever so much
paper, this will benefit the Cotton Planter
liille ; for over issues, that is, issues very
far oIjovc the value of the annual crop, or
the whole amount of the State's productive
labor, only increases the prices of articles
of domestic exchangeable value, such ss ar.

of Cotton, that depends on a foreign demand.

taken Jo persuade the planter thai he is rich ;
that he has spare money to venture in trade;
nod that his patriotism and his interest alike
call on him to draw a part of his capital
from agriculture to invest it in stocks. Now
of all persons he is least fi ted for trade or
stockjobbing, for banking or brokering :
he is too honest, too simple, and hos too
much heart for 44 that sort of thing" : his
occupation is to till the earth, which claims
at his hands a devoted labor, whh all the
skill, science and money he can expend to
revive its fertility. Thnt indeed is a fatal
j>oJicy, wliich draws the capital of the planters
from agriculture, in an indebted State
like ours, whose soils are nearly exhausted
of their fertility ; and where whole Districts
have been abandoned, that may be made
productive, by not very larg inves'ments of
lime and labor. The agricultural is our
commanding interest; and to its improvement
a tone, can we look for the means of
relieving us from our present embarrassments
; for nothing else that w e produce in
South Carolina, except Cotton and Rtce,
will enable us to pay our foreign debts, and
io part the debts of the Union.
Let us not be deceived then ; we are
not that prosperous people M the orators"
would have us. Where are the increased
sources of our wealth ? Has South Carolina,
like Georgia, recently acquired an ex-,
tensive fertile country, and a consequent in- ]
crease of population and resources? Have
new articles ol agriculture or manufacture,
to any importum extent, been produced
among us ? on the contrary, has not a considerable
portion of our negroes been sent
to tho West and South West, <md our ablest
hands put at work on Ra 1 RoaJs, which, as
yet, have give.; little, if any, profit to the
Stockholders 1 Grant that our importations
have near y doubled : that Charleston and
the inland towns hud done an extensive business
; looking to the alarming fact that our
crops must have diminished, how can we
be prosperous ? We arv only so in dress
end equipage, in sumptuous living and wild
excess. True, the firmer now dresses in
broadcloth, nnd partakes of luxuries, that !
he never dreampt of before, but how is he <
to pay for them ? Search the Court records j
for the nnddle and upper country for an an- i
swer. Added to this you will find, that ow !
ing to the accomodations extended to country
dealers by city merchants, who have <
over-stocked themselves with goods, the i
hard working farmer has been tempted with '
luxur'es at his own doorway ; and to pay <
for them, or to avoid the Courts, he has les- i
sened his provision culture and planted <
more Cotton : so that between a diminished
provision crop, and a npt much greater yield I
of Cotton than before, he is in a fair way I
to ruin. i
Sir, we are good natured people,fond oftho
State, and easily excited by appeals to our
patriotism. We have been wrought on to
lend our time and means in aid of the wildest
schemes. No sooner does one plan of
pretended State aggrandizement fail, than
another is suggested. Not looking for a
moment at our internal wants, the improvement
of our rivers, roads, bridges, ferries,
canals, we are taught to believe that
tho opening of one or two highways, through
which articles of foreign 1 ?bor can he irnnsported
to Charleston, will enrich the whole
State, the planters and all. And tl>en we
are to have a direct trade ! as if trade will
not direct itself. How can we have a direct
trade while we aro indebted to the North ?
i How can we throw off our fetters, when we
owe for the very bread we eat ? The planter
(and so can the State) who raises his
own provisions, and is not indeb:ed, may
hold back his Cotton, ship or cause it to
be shipped when lie pleases, but when he
has Corn to buy and is in debt, he raises
his Cotton crop for his creditor. If not so
?if the planter is not indebted to the North,
why should not the patriotic Charleston
merchant export the bulk of our Cotton dired
to England? The truth is plain : we
are indebted to the North for necessaries,
and she will send our Cotton where she lis'
teth !
It is time, then, that our planters should
open their eyes. They have been long
enough charmed by the names of big men.
They, of all others, have a stake in this
cris!s. They have been saddled with Stale
responsibilities to a large umount, in which
ihcy had no lot or profit, and their lands and
negroes are plnrfged for the fulfilment of
t:.em. Where else will the greater part of
ihe State's revenue coma from ? Not the
Stock Companies for they are exempt from
taxation.
Bearing thpse important relations to the
S:ate, as her tax payers and the producers
of her real wealth, the planters should be
gin to think and act for themselves; and
demand of the Legislature such enactments
as will enable them to bear her burdens, and
maintain her character for good faith unimpaired.
They should demand of the State
?not that she would loan the money, or

Culture of Strawberries.
Mr. Dille, Editor of the Farmers Re.
gis'.er, at Newark, Ohio, gives the following
method of cultivating the Strawberry, which
he has practised with great success, Mr.
Dille says
We have been requested by several of
our friends, to give our system of raising
strawberries, in detail. As we have been
very successful in this culture, at least feel
a confidence in our mode of proceeding.
As a matter of course, the preparation of
the soil must precede the planting. It is not
the richest but a proper so I that is required.
New land is generally in a right condition.
If it be old, to a bed of 50 feet long by 20
in breadth, give about four or five cart loads
rotten wood or leaves and wood from the
woods, six cart loads ot cow or hog manure
well rotted, put this upon the soil and spread
it in deep, mixing it well from the surface
down. In spreading see ihat the eaith is
all loose and mellow so that the roots will
have no difficulty in striking wide and deep.
Instead of a high bed, which will be dry,
make it low enough to receive ond retain
the rains which may fall, but not so as to
I have standing pools upon it. A dam is
raised around the beds, or earth, which is
broken down after the fruit begins to form
that the bed may bo reasonably dry whilst
; it is ripening. A dry bed and dry weather
give the sweetest and most fragraut fruit.
Choice of Kinds.?We have cultivated
the common scarlet, the English scarlet,
Keen's seeding, and the wood or field straw,
berry. The first bears best with us, the
last bears well and is the most delicious.
Time of Planting.?March, April, May,
August,September or Octobor. We would
advise in this country that plantations
should be made in April or September.?
Our planting in March has sometimes fail- j
ed, and it is desirable that the plants should 1
have extended their roo:s well in the earl!; 1
before the frost comes on in winter. H(ince 1
September would be preferable to October,
lor Autumnal planting, and better than Au. 1
gust, as there is a great probability of the 1
new plantation being well watered by the '
fall rains. 1
After Culture.?Keep the ground always I
loose or mellow and free from weeds. Let i
nothing else, unless it be some shrubs, as 1
roses, &c. be permitted to grow, on the f
ground with the plants. After the runners 1
have covered the bed with young plants our I
method is to go through the beds with a) r
ipade, and turn up ihe earth, plants and all p
)ne spade width, burying the plants com. c
jletely under, and then leaving a spade's c
width, and so on till we pass through the c
3ed in one direction. n
This we do twice a year, in the bed h
with the spade the other way so as to leave a
he plant in little squares in the bed, 11
when their will be just about enough to co- *
ver the ground properly, and by this means ii
[he earth will always be kept mellow. The t
spade should be about seven inches wide. I'
After this operation in March let the bed r
be lightly covered with tan bark, forest r
[eaves or short straw, for the fruit to rest '
upon and keep clean. Oat straw should t
not be used as it is apt to mildew the fruit, g
This covering should be spaded in as a ma- s
nurc in August. 1
When in blossom you can easily deter- <
mine what poriion of your plants are bear- 1
ers. Those which will not bear produce 1
large flowers, with long showy stamens, t
holding high there black authors. Whilst '
those which will bear have short stamens <
and a great number of pistils, and flowers 1
are every way less showy. If the non 1
bearers are very numerous, many, not nil, 1
should be pulled out. If the weather is |
drv during the flowering season the beds I
~'J e? o .
shoold be slightly watered every evening, <
to set the fruit, but when it begins to ripen 1
keep them dry as possible.
The beds should be about three feet wide I
for the convenience of gathering the fruit <
without tramping down the soil. Never I
use stable or horses manure, unless it be i
well rotted. In spading, select the plants to j
turn under and keep a succession of new i
ones for bearers. I
The following may explain why so few i
people succeed in cultivating strawberries, '
and also, why bed last so few years in good
bearing state.
Cincinnati, June 21th, 1839.
Mr. HammondIn your paper of this
morning, you give an extract from the New
York Journal of Commerce, which it ap- .
pears that a person in the vicinity of that (
city, 4*th? present s? ason sold $240 worth of
strawberries from one acre of ground." Mrs. i
Arbigust, for several years from strawber.
ries, made at the rate of $1000 per acre, |
from her garden, in 'he vicinity of this city.
She raised the variety called the Hudson,
and they measured from 2 to 5 inches in
circumference. For many years she was
the only person in this vicinity, aware of
the fact, that in this and mos: other straw
borry, there are two classes of plants?ihe
one defective in the male, and the other in
the female organs; and that an acre of
either kind separate, would not produce a
perfect fruit. In running, the barren, or
male vine, forms ten new plants, where ihe
female forms one ; and the laiter soon disappear.
She is the only person, with the
exceotion of her children, that 1 have ever
met with, who can tell the male from the
female, when out of blossom, they can be
distinguished at n distance of twenty, tat*
This subject is, even now, but partially understood
; and with the care us<*d by Mrs.
Arbigust, in the vicinity of New York an
equal yield may be obtained.

Gathering and Preserving Seeds.
It v ill soon be time to think about guth.
ering seeds of many kinds for next year.
There are but few people who consider that
plants, as well as animals, may be much
improved by selectinfr muai penucfoctly
grown, and earliest seed. The next
year's crop will not only, by this means,
be increnscd in quantity,but its quality will
also l>e improved. All kinds of seeds that
grow in husks or pods should be strung up
and suspended from the ridgepole or a rafter
in the garret, where they will be out of the
way of mice, and where they will dry grad- I
ually. Great care should be taken to keep
them from an excess of moisture, which 1
will cause them to mould, and destroy the 1
germinative principle; and, on the other I
hand, they will not be so good if they are
shelled out (especially if it is done before 1
they arc perfectly ripe) and placed in the
sun, or any situation where they will dry 1
very rapidly : they thus become shrivelled, 1
and will not so readily vegetate, al: hough 1
the vital principle may not be destroyed. 1
The seeds of squashes ; pumpkins, cucum- s
bers, melons, &c. should be carefully clean- 1
ed from the pulp which surrounds them, 1
and then placed in a situation where they 1
will dry gradually, being every day slirred (
up or turned, to prevent their moulding.
Seeds, after being thus prepared, may be
preserved ft r almost any length of time in *
a perfectly good state, by packing them in 1
pulverized charcoal and keeping them in a 1
dry place, or stopping them entirely from *
the air in a glass bottle. Maine Farmer.

THE TOMATO PLANT A PROTECTION FROM 1
CHINCH-BOO AND BUCKWHEAT FROM THE 1
TURNIP FLY. [
To the Editor ofthe Farmers' Rogister. i
Indian Creek, Lancaster, Aug, ltht 1839. 1
The chinch bug has made usjappearance j
in this county, but too late 1 hope to injure I
very materially the growing crop of coru, i
which is now, by far the most promising 1 i
have ever seen in this region. If this little
insect is as destructive as it has been rep- \
resented to be, to wheat, oats and corn, i
should I live to the next seedling and plant- |
ing season, 1 for one shall seed and plant i
with serious apprehension of reaping and i!
gathering a short crop. Perhaps 1 have i
done wrong to entertain and express such v
npprehension, I write us if I had forgotton o
there is an olLwise and omnipotent being s
who never uses his chastening rod but for n
the good of his intelligent creatures ; and i V
am convinced when the destructive insect s
lias done that14 whereunto it was sent," it p
will disappear, and not till then, and that u
here is a * thus far" for it to go, and41 no g
"arther." But, sir, while i entertain this a
)pinion, I feel it to be my botinden duty ai
o use every means to repel this destructive c<
nvader of our fields. So far as 1 am in. tfi
ormed all efforts heretofore made have had c<
to good effect. A fact was a few days
ast stated to me by a gentleman of this eni
ounty, which I think ought to be communi- hat
ated to you as the editor ofa valuable agri- ant
ultural paper, in order that the information J
lay be made general. The gentlemen al. cor
jded to last sprinti carried out and manured use
piece of ground with ashes and scrapings mu
rom around his kitchen a. d yard, in which ?
rere a quantity of tomato seed vegetated ;
i working his corn he left standing between A
he hills of corn, plants on about an acre of
Mid ; now the fact intended to be com- cor
nunicuted is, that in all this acre of land mo
iot one stalk of corn has been touched by he?
he chinch- bug, while all around about has pe)
ieen fired or rather sucked dry by his in- mc
iect. About two acres were manured with (
ishes and scrapings, and the gentleman a ,
hinks the tomato plants alone protected the
:orn among which they grew, there being bu<
10 difference in the land, or quality or quanity
of the manure applied. I mentioned
his statement to a gentleman in Northumjerland,
who seemed to be at once convin- CIC
:ed that the tomato plums protects the corn, cn
"or said he," I know that the little bug
which is so destructive to cucumber vines pe
will never show itself on them if tomato -i

plants are growing among mem. t nave g
Ihus, sir made to you the above statement
:o use as you please. Gut I do not stand mi
sponsor for the tomuto plant.
As the turnip sowing season is near at
band, I will men'ion (as worthy of notice
at least,) that a gentleman residing not far
from Baltimore told me that to mix or sow tQ
a small portion of buck wheat with turnip
seed would certainly prevent the fly (which CQ
is often so destructive to early sown turnips) ^
from injuring them. He said that the fly ^
greatly preferred feeding on the buck wheat,
and would not touch the turnip as long as - ;
there was any wheat for it to feed on. co

Mr. J. S. Skinner?As the season of Pc
Tomatoes is at hand, I will send a lew ro? a(^
cipes for preserving them for winter use : fo
Take tomatoes, say half peck, when ripe,
but not too soft, skin them and cut them in ?
two, leaving the seeds or not as you like; m,
lay them on a dish, (I do not mash them ;)
then tuke two quarts of strong vinegar, put fc
one tablespoonful of allspice, the same of J>|(
powdered ginger, the same of clovos, the T
same of salt, half.tablespoonful good cayen- t'c
ne pepper; put all (except the tomatoes) in fi'the
vinegar; boil it in a very clean brass or
bell-metal kettle for about half an hour? 9h
then strain it through a sieve, put it again fo
on a slow fire, and when it begins to boil,
put in some of the tomatoes, but do not ur
crowd them, VVlien they look clear take th
them out carefully with a skimmer, and lay th
them on a dish ; do so until you havo them ru
all done, and when co'd put them in glass a(
or white earthen jars with the vinegar in al
which they were boiled. Dip writing pa~ gi
per in brandy or strong vinegar, and put w
over them : ?? * ihein tight, and put in a gi
cool dry place. It is excellent with fn.sh ?<or
any other kind of meat. ui
Another?Take tomatoes when ripe, skin ai
them, cut them in two, lay them on large ei
dishes, put them in the sun to dry, turn tl
them often, and when suffi iently dried f<
in the sun, put them in a dry pluce. They si
should be exposed to the sun after a damp n
spell of weather. When stewed or cooked
in any way, they are almost as good as when jr
first taken from the vines. p(
Another and caey mode of keeping To ma- ^
toes?Make a strong pickle of salt and water
that wi>i bear an egg, make it cold, strain
it into a crock on small keg ; take ripe to- s
matoes, fill the crock or cage, pour the ^
pickle on them, and cover it with a thin gl
stone to keep them under the pickle. In w
the winter when you want some for use,
put them in celd water tho night before, ^
and in the morning change the water until .ij

llllsjr UIU Q9 linou UO JUu nuin inuiii* A it^u ^
cook them, or cat them raw with vinegar,
pepper and salt. J
il cheap and excellent dish?Take cold
cooked meat ofany kind, chop it fine, season w
with salt, pepper, and a little but er and
3pice if you like. Then take stale bread ct
say one-third to two of meat, soak it in D|
milk or water taking care oot to make it
loo wet; mix altogether; then take four or
six large ripe tomatoes, skin them, chop ^
;hem fine put them with the meat and bread,
mix them well together, put in a deep dish, se
ind bake it in a slow oven on a stove for CQ
>ne hour; eat with gravy or not as you like.
Another?Take cold cooked meat, chop
fine, season with pepper, salt* and butter, ?
[ifthe meat is not fa:); boil some potatoes,
mash them, put one-third to two of the meat, so
mix well together, put in a deep dish, bake ul
ilow three-quarters of an hour. Ji?
In your large cities there is a great deal ?
>f provision thrown away by cooks that ,a
might be inaue into wholesome and palata- ea

fear. As this hint comes from an old lady, Pri
hope my fair countrywomen will not take P
t amiss, but pront tnereoy ; ana 10 maKe

To preserve tomatoes in sugar, take them *a

Mulberry Sales.?A gentleman in
hatly, wtio purchused last spring $350
rth of Mulberries, has just sold the crop
>*ving therefrom, to be delivered next aunn,
for $1800 !?being an increase upon
outlay of $1450. The trees are of asted
kinds. Ibid.
The Snow Mill, Md. Banner states that
;entleman of that village has sold a lot
of ihrifiy morus multicaulises at two dollars
per tree. They were choice trees, grown
from roots set out last spring, and are now
six feet in height.
The silk Farmer reports the following
among other sales of trees.
Mr. L. I. Cox, of Baltimore,sold 25,000
averaging 31-2 feet at 40 cents (over 111-2
cents per foot) the root thrown in , payment in
full made on signing the contract Mr. Carter
Harrison 30 miles from Richmond, sold 500
from last spring's cuttings at $1,16 each,cash
down. At Che8tfcrtown, Md. a sale of 900
roots was made at $900. At Westchester,
Pa. a sale of 18,000 trees at 10 cents per foot.
[Advertisers of trees do not commonly, yet,
state their prices. There are, however, some
exceptions; a largo lot is advertised in the
National Intelligencer, and another in the Richmond
Enquirer, each at 2 cents the bud, a lo* to
Raleigh at the same price, one in Fayctleville
at a cent a and half, and one in Prince George's
county Va. at from three quarters of a cent to a
cent. These are ail the recent advertisements in
which we see the prices stated, and in all, except
the last the time for taking the prices named is
limited to about the close of the present month.
Prices have,been gradually rising 6iaco the first
ales in the early part of summer, natwithstond*
inf the depression in the money market. Efforts'
hare been made to keep them down by a few
persons who contracted last year to deliver trees
the present season at 10 or 12 cents, and who in
consequence of the failure of their cuttings to
grow are obliged to buy at present prices to
fulfil t.eir engagements. But they might as
well attempt to keep down the tides of the oc ^an
by the pressure of their hands. The article is
now so extensively diffused that nothing but the
extent of tho demand can materially affect the
price. In some aspects of the matter it might,
perhaps, be desirab c to see the price lower ; but,
upon ttho whole, tho benefit a cruing to tho
country from the high prices excoeds the injury,
?if indeed injury there bo at all. The high
prices stimulate production, while they draw ten
, times the attention to the subject which it would
yet, otherwise attract; and the more it is looked
into by men of entcrprize and reflection, the moro
! rapidly will the trees be bought and the silk
r culture extend, as experience abundantly proves,
i Besides, the highest prices are so low compared
, with the profits of the silk culture that no judi.
cious purchaser can lose by them. Indeed there
is no other investment which a farmer or planter
1 can mak9 with the same prospect of good profit)
i and this is the very, the only consideration that
keeps up the price. If, thorcfore the rapid in*
1 creaso of the productive wealth of the country,
and the saving of the more than twenty millions
t of moucy now sent annually abroad foi the pur*
, chase of silks would bo an advantage, the high
r price of Moras Muliic&ulis is certainly, upon the
? who'o, no disadvantage. It injures none, while
1 it benefits many directly, and the whole country

[ ting the published sales of Morus Multicaulie

it From the foregoing it will be seen that
a the sales of tre is r<'[)orted In a single week
r exceed 30,000, and hat prices are contin*
e ually adavneing. in the face of a pressure
for money severe enough to depress tho
r? price of both flour and cotton. The selling
season is moreover not half gone, yet at
,j least one.quarter of all thejrees in the coun0
try have been sold, some of ihem two or
three times. At this time last year, no one
i. thought of buying trees ; but now, before
0 they are half grown, and before the purcha.
d ser can tell what size the trees he is buying
: will altain to, the demand at home and at
|# the West is rapidly taking the stock off the
n grower's hands.
The naked fact is this : the people of this
e country have become so thoroughly satis.
? fled of the great profit to be realized by
f? growing silk, that the mighty movement in
that direction, which is now urging on all
t classes to embark in it, cannot be repressed
until our whole country is luxuriant with

| ching when, in advertising a farm for sale,
c it will be as indispensable a recommend*
3 ation to it to say that it contains five, ten,
P or twenty acres of Multicnulis trees, as that
| it contains as many of mu?dow or wood*
. land. We import $25,000,000 of silk
{ every year; if we pay for it in raw silk, as
we first exported our raw cotion, it will
require two thousand millions of Muliicaulis
( trees to produce that quantity of silk?and
4 thfy must be good trees also. When wo
pay in raw silk for our importations of tho
manufectured article, we have the markets
of France and England open to us. They
' alone import annually nine millions of
t pounds of raw silk. If sdk then, be so
| great a staple of Europe, nothing but the la.
| ztmss of Americans prevents us making it
^ a staple with us, and the reader knows well
I that we are not a l;i2y people. We have
now the steam power, tho cotton power,
| the tobacco power, and a multitude ofoth.
er powers, all affording their respective amounts
of comfort to the People of this
country. But we lack one power yet; I
mean the power?that power which has fed
half China and all Italy for so many hun.
dred years?that army of lit ing machines,
whose collective potency the shallow, and
brainless, and ignorant croakers of the day
have not the smallest conception of. Let
I them read and learn.
