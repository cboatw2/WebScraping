DWARF FRCIT TREES.
In some places. es|>ceial|y in France, a
method prevails of cultivating dwarf fruit
tr*es. These are said by Eriglish and
F?euch writers, to bay many advantages.
Tne trees ur? not as much exposed to high
winds, the produce better frutt? bear earlier,
and mnrt* abundantly.
Dwarf trees are produced by inoculating
on stocks of comparatively slow growth.?
T us by inflfulat ng the apple on the Para,
dise or Dpv.'<u stock, ibe peach on a slow
growing plum stock, nnd the pear on the
quincd stock, &e. This is practised her1*,

more particularly, in garden* where the
tn-es are set ah.ng the#t>orders, al ernating
wiih goosebenies or currant bushes.
The pruning and management of dwarf
appleg and pear re?*s. are well described in
the following remarks.
The first subjects of the following re.
marks, fromdheir appearance., were planted
six or seven year* previously to the coin,
inenremeut of miy pruning being given
i em. In consequence they require-! to be
very much thinned oil*, to lis to get the
branches clear of each ottier. For tbinn ng
I always tarn* in unnd to cut fie old wood
off close to the ?te,xi or branch it was attached
to; this prevented voung wood
spri igiug afterwards. Wbeu the frees j
were thinned of the old shoo s, as ubove
Mated the young side shoots wore wtiat is
generally termed spurred in ; ihnt m, they
were so atior eued, that only two or three
were lefi on them, ai d ihe leading top
shoots wore fthoiteiied to half their length.
Tih* following Hil l every suectftedingyear,
"the trees were trean d in the mite manner,
as ro.pl c s the young wood, till they had
acquired the desned h ight. wtwn the lend.

uml'-r Ins tre uincn , they shouid be pre.*
v nted noing so. by cutting off part of the
old w od, along wall die yound.shoots imnr

prevent the s ?'(r so cm from increasing in
length. Tne spurs must lie treated in a
similar manner, by curing ofTa small por. '

when I hey are ge tmg too long. !
"I have never found the above treatment

But that inconvenience will be ultimately sue*

To attempt hi tiring very old trees info this

DIFFERENT N"DR9 <?F PRESERVING AND PREPARING
TOMATOES FOR THE TABLE.
Canons'/urg. August Hi/A, 1839.
Mr. J. S. Skiiiiioi?As the season ofiomn
O' s .s >tt hand, I will send a few recipes
tor preserving tlvin for winter use.
Take toma oes, lay half a peck, when
ripe, but not too si iff. skin tiiein and cut
hem in two, leaving the i'^s or not as
vou like; lay them on a dish, (I do no'
m ibIi til* in ; (lien take two quarts of-Iron
vinegar, put one table-spoonful of all-spice,
he same of powdered ginger, the same of
salt, half n table-spoonful good Cnynnn*'
pepper ; put all (except ihe tomatoes) in the
vinegar; boil it in a very clean brass or
o?-|| metal kWile for about half an hour?When
s rain it through a sieve, put it again on u ,
slow fire, and when ii begins to boil, put in
some of I he tomatoes, but do not crowd
tiicm. When they look clear, take them
out carefully with a skimmer, and lay them
on a dish ; do so until you have them all
done, and when cold, put them in a glass or
white earthem jar, with tho vinegar in
which they were boiled. Dip writing paper
111 br mdy or strong vinegar, and put over
them ; cover th?m tieht, and put in a cool
plaee. It is excellent with fresh, or any
other kind of moat.
Another ?'Take toma'oes when ripe,

j large dishes, put flivm in the sun to

dry, (urn them often, and wtani; * suf. |
ficiently dribd in the sun, put them ifT^dry
place. They should be exposed low? *u?
afier a damp spell of weather. wh?*n
slewed or Cooked in any way, they ure
n I most at good as when first takenifnwi^
the vines.' "V ' 41
Another and easy mdtlc of keeping Umiatoes.?Make
a strong pickle of salt nndwttter
that will bear an egg, make it coltl, strain it
into a crock, or email keg; take ripp to.
mutoes, fill laverock or keg, pour the ftickle
on them. and cover it with a thin supe to
keep th? m under the pickle. In tfami*er
when you wijir tome* for use, put 'hum in
cold water the nigt b fnroVnd in the. ^om ,
mg chnnge the wafer until hey nie asfresh
as ynu want tliem. Then cook them, or
eat them faw will vinegar, |>"pp?r and salt.
A cheap an excellent dish.? "ake cold
c ooked meal of any kind, chflnit fine, season
with sal*, pepper, and a little butler and
spice if you like. Then take stale bread,
say one. third to two of meat, soak it rh iniik
or water, taking care not to make it too
wet ; then i?ke four or six large ripe tomatoes,
Skrn h? m, chop*th'*rn fine, put thertl
with the and bread, mix them wHI to.
gether, put in a deep dian, an J bake it in a
slow oven on a stove, for one hour; eat vri.ti
gravy or not :?s you like.
An'tther.?Take cold rooked meat, chop
fine, h oot fat); bod some potatoes, mash
them, put one.rhird 10 two of the meat, mix
well together tti a deep dish, bake slow
thrcc.quarrH* of an hour.
In your large cities ihere is a gn at deal
of provision ttirown away by cooks that
migb be inaile into wholesome and palatable
dishes I have made. Ifour housewives
would look mure in o their larders, they
might wave their husbands some dollars in
the course of he \ear. As "his hint conies
from an old lady, I hope my fair countrywomen
wdl not take it otniss, but profit
tliereby ; and to make up, I will give another
rpcipe.
To preserve tomato s in sugar, tako them
when ri< e, but not too ft. skin and cut
them in two, taking out the seeds; take,
for one pound of tomatoes three-quarters of
a pound of sugar, loaf or brown ; loaf is
best to keep them. First take two fresh
lemons, cut them in thin slices, put litem fti
one quart of water, boil them*; until soft,
strain the seeds ou:f add die sugar, let it
boil fur halt an hour slowly, then put in as
many tomatoes as not to crowd them,?
Lot them hod until clear, then take them
out carefully with n skimmer, lay them on
[i Inrg dish,then pu more in, and boil ihem
[tie came ; do so until oil are done. When
cold, put them in glass jtrs. If there is not
syrup enough to cover .hem, make a Utile
more. When all is cold, dip white writing
paper in brandy, cover them with tt, put
double pnp?r over tiiem. t o tiiem tignr, una
keep them in a cool dry plare.
I hope that your ynunz housewives wi'l
endeavor to be the mothers of invention,
and have the credit of making their own
recipe* and cookery.

eight addition"! improvements ??? former pa euta.)
of which classified and ulphabe.ical
lists are annexed, marked A and B.
During the mime period, tliree hundred
and :hreo patents have expired, us per
list marked C.
The reveip* of office for 1839 amount to
$37,260, from which may he deducted $5,.
769, paid on applications withdrawn.
The ordinary expenses of the Patent
Office the past year, including payments for
ttie library and agricultural Ktatis'ics, were
$20,799 95, leaving a surplus of $11,450
43 to be credited to the patent fund, us per.
statement marked E.
For the re* oration of models, records,
and drn\* iug*. under the net of 3d March,
1837. $7 1173 07 have been expended, as
per statement imrk?d FToe
receipts- oJ the Offico would have
been nearly $3 000 nru>re, had not the late
law permit ed assignrn'mis t<r be i^corded
without charge, a grmuityf however, whic ?
has given rn ich satisfied'>n.
In compliance with the net of 3J of
March, 1830, I have published a digest ol
all patents, grant- d hy the United States,
add ma thereto an alphabetical index, and
shall depo.site in the. library of Congress nine
hundred coum's of the same. *
The old digest was very defective, A
new arrangement has b?-en made, giving to
each inventu?n its appropriate classification.
A distribution ot 'he now digest, will ma.
terially lessen the correspondence of the
office, and guard citiz-ns* against the impositions
ol vender? of spurious patents. The
volume contains above seven hundred and
fifty pages. ; .
The work was deemed necessary for
daily reference in the office, and believing
the appropriation adequate to cover the ex
penses, I did not delay the publication.
A small additional appropriation from
the patent fund wil be required to complete
nynsDl for the same.

H&rdt much ficility to inventors; and if
P'Emission were given to deposit with cof') -stars

such accommodations would obviate one
cause of perplexity and ilel.ij. and be more

of reorgawz ltion, nn l to carry out the wish,
en ot Congress by collecting and distributing
valuable seeds ; exhibiting, also, un lor appropriate
classifications, 'ho most important
varieties, both exotic and indigenous.
The inquiries propounded by ill honorable
secret.iry of state, in taking the n'-xt
census, rendered it necessary tor we com
m hsioner to expend hut a small part of ihe
nppmpri riou lor prorurmg agricultural gta
t'ktics. From data ofso hjgh h source, the
commissioner can samly pr?*dicato future
calculation*, and hopes to present to Con.
gress such dermis qf domestic product.* us
wHI be of importance in financial estimates.
The diplomaticcor-ps of the-United Stan*
residing atiroad. have been solicited to aid
in procuring valuable seeds, and the officers
iof the navy, with llie approbation of dig lion,
orablc secretary of that dep .rimem, bav?been
requeued to convey to the paftr
office, ford strburion, such seeds us may hi

l>e made for seeds. It small expenses do arise,
tliey can he reimbursed f?v npprupriations
from the patent fund, daily accumulating,
und consecrated specially to the pro
motion 01 the ars and sciences.
The cheerfulness with which rho diplo
raatic corris and the officers of life n;>yy
have received the request of this office,
justify sanguine anticipations from this new
undertaking.
With the additional assistance granted
last session, and correspondent exertions on
the part of these connected with' the bureau,
the business in each tupifich is brought up.
Less delay w.H, I trust, arise in fu urcappli

Th<* number of caveats issued in I83y
was two huudrud and twon y-five.
Tlie number of applications for pa'ents
tlie same ^ ear exceeds eight hundred. One
half of these have b-en rejected on exnmin
ation. Tnat the investigations of the offi.-e
have not been conducted wnhout rare and
attention, may perhaps be inferred from the
fact that no appeal has been taken from the
decision of the commissioner on d.cse cases.
Tlicse rejections will show paleness, that

of the finest rice plantations in the Stat/'.?
Of their management, we do not p-oposo
to treat nt present, huf confine our remarks
to the crops grown in Middle and Upper
St. John's. Of these, the most importun*
is Cotton. The variety grown hero is
what is known in Commerce ns the "San?..?
" mi inferior kind of Sea.Island or
Black Seed, which inferiority is in a great
m-n^ure, if not wholly produced by locality.
Wo say ia-a great measure* for no
onej who has witnessed the great improvement*
made on the Sea Isf.inds in the staph*
of their co ton. but must be convinced that
u similar improvement .could bo brought
about v\ h'.'rcever the same variety of cotton

der.-tood. We do not belitne that the fineness
of the staple oftho Sea Island cottons
coufdever be attained, by cotton grown
beyond the influence of the sea atmosphere

Tho reason why wo suppose --that the Sea
Island cottons can never b?* sucessfully rivalled
in fineness is,ihat the peculiar atmosphere
in vyliich they are giovvn, is wanting
and this cannot, as fur as our experience j
goes, he in any manner supplied. So great I
an influence was supposed to do exerted by |
this atmosphere, that p'antntioufin the into, j

step taken towards the advancement pf
ouf ngnculiu^, writhe'Society njcrfl the
thanks of die community for it, which- we
hope to sue imitated by all of the Agricultu;*

sfitfr whom we are acquainted, is better
able to carry on this nice investigation,
tiinn tlx? able Professor, to whom the Agricultural
Society of St. John's Colleton
have assigned it. Tite many advantages
which would arise from an accurate analysis
of our soils, are so obvious, that we
sea ce feel warranted in alluding lo them.
We, however, cannot refrain from men
tioning n few. The first is, that hnving
seer ironed the component parts ofa fertile
soil, and the relutive proportions of each
ingredient; we can bv analysing our own discover
in what*it is defjciimt, or in what
it sup'*ra bounds. and if practicable, apply
the remedies which may bring it n'-uror the
s andurd we aim nt. A gam, it wdi euable
? t \ _ t j
us to correri an?i ormg inio cuiure, spoia,
and in some instance's acres which, at present
are wholly unproductive, when cultiva*
t" in particular crops. For instance^?
it is well known that in many fields, both
on the islands-and main* there are spots
which produce what is called the '-Blue
cotton,1' which yields nothing. Othof
spots are suhj'-ct to the "rust,"?-as soon as
tli'Se are ari.dyzed, and compared witji (
fertile soils, their excess or.deficiency, in
.my patti *ui;?r ingredient, will at once be
detected, nnd the remedy npplied. The
analysis, therefore of the first quality of
Sea-Island cotton landa will at once OKtnh. ,
li.sh a stand ird, by which all on which are "
grown the same varieties of cottton can b"
judged. The same benefi s will result from
analysing the toils in wh ph other .crops
are culhvirt?'d. But will die analysis of-the
soils, of E'listo' Island benefit oor friends of
S-. John's Berkly, or elsewl?cre ??much,
for they will, by it, become acquainted with
the component parts of the best soils for
growing Sea Island cottons in* and by
analysing their own, they can ift c<i<ce ascertain
ihe d.fFt.rcncp, and how near, by
ndm xtures, or application of manures, they
can approximate. But to P'turn to the
culture of cotton in St. John'-s BMfkly.
Tn? soil of the Middle St. Johns h a

itt so light, -ilmr it may almost be termed
sandy. It is seldom tl.ot a selected

any <>t'i r crbp. The selection being generally
made on account of the supposed
adapt ion oi'thesod to this particular plant
or the locality of toe livid Small fields-are
sometimes alternated, but the lufge, scarce

of the planters adopt the plan of placing the
manure und- r the 1st, or ra her they strew
i between the rows, and iben fbrm a list
which of course mixes the manure, cotton
8'a'ks, weeds, grasses, lind earth (forming
the lis:) well together. A very small bed
is made on tins, which is gradually Increased
in width, (bu: not height,) at each working
Som-s however, prefer to make the bed ut
once of the size intended, and endeavor to
keep it thus throughout the season. The.
line in tins and the subsequent opera ions is
the principal instrument used. The plough
if used hi all, is only employed !o break up
the alleys. Formeily tint "skimmer" was
much used, but from some cause which I
could not lenrn. it has been laid aside.?
From the *20 n March to Is: April, the crop
is planted. Tim holes aro not made us
formerly, by the boo, but by what U termed
a dibble; made from a 2 1-2 inch plank.6
mel?'s wide, ai d tapered to a half inch, at.
the bottom, whilst the upper part is formed
into a handle. Across this, a groove is cut
dagoninllv, into which a lath or thin piece
of board is fixed, which can be readily adjusted
to different d.stances, and is of such
length as to touch the grobnd when tltc
dibble is struck in:o the bed, and marks the
spot where the next hole ts *o be made.?
The usual distance is from 20 to 24 inches
and it is supposed that two hours is gained
by using ;l?e dibble in the place of the boo.
Tne thinning commences at the second
work ng, is continued at the subsequent and
com peted, by the time t{ie plants arc six
inches high?ono stalk only being Jefi in
each hole. Of course e ich planter endeavors
to keep his fields os clear of grass
as possible, and hoes as often as he-can,
which however is seldom more titan five
times, Tlic crop is usually laid hy, from
the 20th to the 2Stb July?but we find that
the opinion of some of the best planters, is
ui favour of laying it by, by the 1st of Julys
even though it be a li'tle grassy ; working
it later, they think, increases the grtnatb,
and prevents tho pod* from maturing, la
hoeing, some incrcav* ihe*s:2e of their beds
gradually, whilst .a'lvw* aro careful to to

does not exceed 100 lbs. per acre, except
when manured; the average on manureI

250 lbs. have been# inajje on sixty acpes.
We have, in the above, given tho otitdine
of (he culture os practised in thrs parish,
and will notion a few particulars morn in
detail. We have stated thut no rota,
lion is. followed,nnd one of the strongest
reasons nssij&cd, -(and one not readily
tio over) is. that the thrco principal crops
(cotion, corn and potatoes) are cuhi*
vatcd in sikh unequal quantities, that h ro* '
tutton with these is out of the question, and
no other.crops at prevent offer suMhnt
inducement*. But id. hough no rota'ion at
present can be established,, yet Hin crops
grown on some of* the small fields are at
times alternated, it has been found that
cot:on and corn can be cultivated, by tho
aid of manure, for an ind. finite period, on
tho same soil, without diminution of-pro*
duct, yet potato* s cannot no matter what
quantities of manures, may bo applied.?
C>rn succeeds, as is well known, admirably
after potatoes, hut for years, it was believed
that-cotton could not be-successfully grown.
This, however, was an crrror which is now
happ.Iy corrected. It only /requires, us
Major I'orchrr has fu9Ky hyertained, that
ttic ground be bedded up, very early, (soy
in J.rnftiiry) Sothnt the beds way consolidate,
a& U?ts cuu?? of tho roffon*a dying appears
to be connected with the loosener of
the soil ; the more compart the b?il h the
better wid lie tlm s?iid,M nnd the sooner
t reaches the hard ear.h under tlm bed, the
sooner will it prow off. Hence the reason
for small bed*. This is directly at vnrianca
with the praciice pursued on tlio S'jn Islands,
but of their cult-urn wo hope li* renf.
tor to give some interesting details, nnd
will not here enter mho any comparison.
Many cxpor mi nts were related to us,
going to show that corp and cotton may bo

when proper ,quint?t:e? of mnnrrrcs buvo

instances, one a field at Mexico, *ajcr
Porcher**) which has b?*en cultivated with,

is the field of Mr. Thomas W. Poreher,
already- alluded to, which produced 170
Ids. per acre. Dr. RnveuePs fields, which
have been in the oul uro oi cotton ftir years
