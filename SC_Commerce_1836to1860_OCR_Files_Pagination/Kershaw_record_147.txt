thenar of bis nifth and the fatal madness
which tooled lps -steps from the paths of
virtue; when suddenly a ray of light illftiriggled
nis prison?he looked up?it was
Zofah. Her eyes' dark orb still shone
with undiminished lustre; but there was in
the proud smile which curled her elevated
lib an expression of demoniac triumph,
which ?hilled the Rabbi's blood. Hiding
his bice in his robe, he exclaimed.
"False tempter, begone?I have done

Rabbi" Abimelech, it ifc said the vainglorious
man shall fall in the snare of his
own heart/ The time hath come, and
thou could'st not stand fast."
Racar! art thou there?' shouted Abimelech
as he recognised in the speaker
the voice of the mendicant to whom he
had given abns at the Water Gate on the
previous evening. Burning with rage, he
seized the prophet of evil by the throat;
but the strengtn of the old man far exceeded
his o^n, and he flung him to the earth
with a violence which shook his very
frame. Starting up he beheld not the old
lieggar of the Water Gate, nor the tempter

with a yellow harvest moon streaming
through the lattice. Several minutes
elapsed before he could convince himself
that the horrors he had undergone were
but the airy paintings of a dream, and
then prostrating himself on the ground,
he exclaimed, in the fulness of his heart,
4It is a lesson from the Lord, I was proud
of my own strength, and when the trial
came I was delivered to the Evil One.*
From that day forth, the Rabbi Abimelech,
walked in the path of humility.
He had experienced the danger of selfconfidence:
and he learnt to pity, rather
than condemn those, who like himself, had
fallen in the struggle with The Tempter.
From New Orleans.
The arrivals of emigrants and strangers
to our city, are daily increasing. This
influx of fuel to the fever, which if it has
abated in its ravages, has been for want j
!,(' nntpimon< ?rill ??11 .1
i Ft liutlllttvill, It ill tl Vy IVtCU) Ulll SWt/U 1116
already too distressing amount of mortality
among us.
In all probability a very large proportion
of these strangers, are without the
necesSary means to enable them to leave
the city until such time as the health of it
will justify their return. We do hope
that the acknowledged humanity and
generosity of all classes of our citizens,
co-operating with the different municipalities,
will see to it, that these unfortunate
emigrants have some relief extended to
them in this period of calamity and distress.
Their ignorance, or it may be their
fool-hardness, has led them to our city
thus early, but they are here, and others
to follow, and feelings of humanity should
prompt to measures of relief, when the
distress is ascertained.
The lapse of a few weeks will restore
to our city health to the mournful aspect
of disease aud death, will succeed the life,
and animated gaiety of winter and to the
stagnation of business, the bustle of active
commerce. Death has made no small
vacuum among the ranks of the young1
and the middle-aged, the industrious ana
enterprising of our citizens, and left an
aching void in the hearts of surviving relatives
and friends, still successive waves of
population will speedily roll in, and to the
eye at least, remove all traces of the devastating
storm that has raged among us.
There is no virtuous, well aisposed and
intelligent citizen among us, but has long
deprecated a state of society, which though
it may not openly encourage, still shamefully
acquiesces in the toleration of practices
at variance with good order and
social tranquility. We have no law in
our statute books more openly and generally
violated, and we regret to addT even
often by those who are specially sworn to
see that all laws are observed, and their
infractions met with the merited punish-1
ment, than that prohibiting the wearing of j
firearms or other deadly weapons about
their person. The repeated calamities,
and of a distressing character, that occur
from the wearing of pistols, Bowie knives,
&c., have often struck the community
with dismay, y6t still no efficient remedy
?ecins to have been devised to prevent a
recurrence. It is high time that those entrusted
with the due administration and
enforcement of our laws, should take a
proper stand on the subject to which we
nave alluded.
One or two examples made by the
proper prosecuting officers, aided by intelligent
citizens and impartial tribunals,
should at once be made, and the guilty
condemned to the fullest penalty of the
law, when this is done, and not till then,
shall ws see the lawless and desperate
made to abandon the wearing of impli
\
ments of destruction, that could only be
justified among men, approaching nearer
the degraded Cannibal than civilized beOur
city has suffered long enough under
the imputation, too deservedly fastened
upon it, of witnessing scenes of blood add
assassination, hot only occurring in darkness^
but inthe broadgku-e of.aay, with a
feeling too much allied to indifference, and
this occasioned, doubtless from -a belief,
that either inadequacy, or what is more
probable, an indisposition on the part of
all to attend to a proper observance of the
laws, too much characterizes the comma*,
nity. !

"Cronstadt, Aug. 5,1837. $
"This day week wo anchored in this
place, and at about 1 o'clock of the same
day, the Emprror [of Russia] visited the
ship incog., with all his Ministers, among
whom was the distinguished diplomatist,
Count Nesselrode. It was his wish to
have visited and left the ship without being
recognised. But, in this he was disappointed
; for it was soon whispered among <
the crew, that the Emperor Nicholas i
was on Board; and, indeed, it required but J
little penetration to discover in the crowd
the man who is considered the best looking
personage in all his dominions. On his
leaving our ship, we manned the yards,
ran the Russian flag to the mainmast
head, and saluted him with foily-one guns,
which was immediately returned by the
same number, by one of his frigates; he
(the Emperor) causing the American flag
to be hoisted at fris mast head ; an honor,
it is said, never before paid to any foreign.

came down and conveyed the Commodore
and Mr. Dallas to Peterhooff, his summer
residence. Last Monday evening, another
boat of the Emperor's came down, and
took a number of officers, including myself,
to the Palace. On our landing from the
boat, we found the Emperor's carriages,
with splendid horses, waiting for us, with
a General, one of the Emperor's aids, to
conduct us. We were taken round the
Gardens and then to the Opera, where we
saw the Emperor, the Empres's and their
daughter, the grand Dutchess. The day
following, one of the Emperor's boats was
sent down to take Mr. Dallas to St. Petersburg.
Several officers, with myself,
accompanied Mr. Dallas, and, after dining
with him, went in the evening to one of
the most beautiful Opera houses I had
ever seen; where, it was said, there were
more than three hundred persons on the
stage at the same time, forty of them female
dancers, not inferior, in my opinion,
to Madam Celeste.
"It took me three hours and a half to
walk through the winter palace, and fotir
to go through the armory. The latter
piace, contains two hundred stand of
arms, in perfect order, besides all the standards
taken from the Turks. I saw several
curiosities of the Empress Catherine;
the gig that Peter the Great rode in, and
his triumphal chariot; and all the dresses
worn by the Emperors and Empresses,
from the time of Catherine and Peter the
Great, down to the present day. I visited
some of the most splendid and richest
churches, perhaps, in the world,
"Whilst we remained at St. Petersburg,
one of the Emperor's aids accompanied
us every where, and extended to us every
civility and attention in his power, ft
would have taken me several months to
have indulged my curiosity. I need not
add, that I was exceedingly pleased with
my visit, and highly gratified at the attention
paid us."?Nat. Intel.

PUBLIC IMPOS1TON.
The undersigned deem it a duty Which
they owe to themselves and the public, to
give the following detail of facts in relation
to the imposition practiced oh them by
the Contractors and Agents connected
with the great Mail Stage route from
Gaston, on the Roanoke river, to Fayetteville,
N. C.. We took the Mail at Washington
city, and on our arrival at Gaston,
entered our names for Fayetieville, where
the agent defpatched a mail cart with the
baggage and part of the mails?at Warrenton
the agent not only imposed on us an
extra passenger, but stated that had he
fourteen offered, he was bound to receive
them?when within a few miles of Raleigh
the stage tongue broke from the excessive
heavy load which the stage was burthened
with; after in hour's delay we were temporarily
repaired and proceeded on as
far as Mrs. Barkley's, 36 miles north of
Fayetteville, here we were told the extra
baggage cart could proceed no further
aitnough ttie agent at Uaston had expressly
told us it should continue on to Fayetteville;
owing to this, we were not only
greatly inconvenienced by the accumulated
quantity of mails, but our lives iminently
placed in peril, from the dreadful
state of the roads over which our route
lay, and we owe it only to the careful and
experienced skill of the several drivers on
the route, through the interposition of a
kind Providence, that the place of our
destination was reached in saiety.
